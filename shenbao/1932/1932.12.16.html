<p>時評</p>
<h3>中蘇復交後對於蘇俄應有之認識</h3>
<p>光陰荏苒自一八事變以至今日瞬又十五閱月此十五閱月中以言軍事則民衆有收復失地之慘呼而擁兵者方酣於鬩墻之内戰以言外交則喧嚷於日内瓦奔走於歐美都會者不外欲以約章裁制侵略以公理戰　强權其爲虚玄夢想而終於跋涉徒勞已早爲識者所共見今者圖窮七見形勢日非乃翻然改計而有中蘇復交之舉雖將來之進展尙未可逆料而外交上之另闢新蹊徑别求出路則已可槪見也</p>
<p>現時代國際間一切之演變胥不外經濟上利害關係之策動如猶欲以私人間之情感轉移外交上之局勢則非爲自欺欺人必爲受愚遇驅往昔歐洲各國亦多有圖以姻婭關係改繼國際間之形勢者而今無聞焉故時至今日倘外交官之口吻猶不出某也與吾友善某也爲吾業師某也吾可惑以至誠某也吾可曉以至理則其終於失敗必無待於編著質言之處今日而言外交其唯一關鍵在於認淸各方之經濟環境</p>
<p>吾人所以認國聯不能爲吾國之助者非謂國聯中之任何一國與吾國不睦亦非謂國聯中之任何人與吾人有𨻶更非謂國聯中之任何國任何人之甘於毁棄公法約章蔑視公理正義國聯之所以不能厚助吾國者則以國聯爲籌謀國際和平之機關而在現時代帝國主義間國際和平意義之下中國成爲必然的犧牲品資本主義之發展已達日暮途窮之頂點致命之經濟恐慌使列强間之衝突日趨銳化其唯·緩和衝突維持和平之方法即爲向殖民地及準殖民地之加重盤剝加重盤剝之所得如能公允分配則資本主義即可苟延殘喘而戰爭即可暫不爆發羣虎相爭必有死傷合力捕羊則腹果而爭可息國際和平之意義如此而已放在客顴上一切國際和平運動其目的均不出公平分割殖民地及準殖民地而捨此以外亦决無其他有效的維持世界和平之手段國際之形勢若此而士大夫者流動欲賣國聯以保全公約威嚴體貼人情公理誡日本以　食傷生失道寡助一若目下之外交仍可效包胥秦廷之哭以收至誠感人之效者其爲對牛彈琴歟輿虎謀皮歟誠不知其可矣</p>
<p>往者不可諫來者猶可追吾人以後之所期望於蘇俄者將又如何乎曩者王印川氏曾以蘇俄軍備之專主防守證明蘇俄非帝國主義吾人之意則認爲以軍備證明一國之是否帝國主義猶欠澈底因軍備之設施仍無能逃於經濟關係之需要而資本主義之進展所以必須形成帝國主義者亦正因其經濟制度上有無可避免迫不獲已之因果關係蓋資本主義之生產就各個生產者而言必求其產品之收入多於生產費之支出收支之差則爲資主之利潤故綜合全國生產者而言則其生產之總量必超過全國消費之總量而此項超過消費量之產品又必須向海外覔取市塲然後資主之利潤可變爲金錢以資積蓄而國家之富力亦可藉以增高此海外之市塲更必須爲生產幼稚輸入超過輸出之國家否則我以產品往被以產品來兩相抵銷金錢即無由内溢此列强之所以必須經營殖民地及準殖民地也自有殖民地及準殖民地之經營於是爲抵抗爭奪及壓抑反動計乃不能不擴張其軍備而專事侵略之帝國主義於是形成</p>
<p>蘇俄爲社會主義之國家其生產資本爲國家所獨占其生產目的在於供給全國人民之消費某種產品之消費而嫌不足也則輸出他種消費有餘之產品以換取之倘仍有餘則或即减低其生產或存貯之以備將來之需臂之大戶之家田地居屋傳自祖先父子兄弟合力耕種姑嫂姊妹合力紡織耕種紡織之所得則共同消費之消費不足則相率節約消費有餘則存貯以備不時之需所謂生產過剩之恐慌於我無有焉工作繁劇則夜以繼日工作减少則共事休息所謂失業之恐慌於我亦無有焉惟其如此故蘇俄之對外貿易關係不出以物易物之方式各獻所餘各取所需交易而退各得其所而以武力爭奪殖民地在蘇俄殆根本非　必要其軍備之專主防守乃以此耳</p>
<p>惟其經濟上之關係君此故日人而爭奪長江之霸權　蘇俄必袖手旁觀即爭奪東三省之經濟霸權蘇俄亦未必以兵戎相向然爭奪東三省而欲樹立一反蘇俄之滿洲僞國則患在肘腋之間蘇俄爲自身安全計不能不予以重大之注意此則爲蘇俄與吾國利害相同之點亦即吾人所可冀於中蘇復交以後國際形勢之變化者</p>

<p>國聯十九特委會</p>
<h3>通過决議草案</h3>
<p>内容空洞僅敷衍局面</p>
<p>大國袒日態度不變</p>
<p>美俄參加與否未定</p>
<p>我國祇有兩條路可循</p>
<p>堅不屈撓或供人犧牲</p>
<h3>墨西哥憤大國壓迫小國通知退出國聯</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國特委會今日已通過起草委員會之决議草案、（十五日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）五人起草委員會繼續開會三日、因大小國意見不一致、屢起激辯、直至今日下午十九國特委會開會前、起草委員會始商定决議草案、聞包含下列各點、㈠調解原則之基礎、㈡邀請美俄之程序、㈢接受李頓報告問題、此項草案經十九國特委會通過、並送交中日雙方後始提出國聯大會討論、但因蘇俄似將拒絕參加、而美國參加與否、又屬未定、故前途困難至爲明顯、國聯雖欲以其權力實行和解、但大國袒日態度未改、中國祇有兩條路可走、一則堅不屈撓、一則供人犧牲耳、（十五日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯十九國委員會所設之　國起草委員會、今日上下午各開會一次討論議决案問題、席上英外長西門依然極力壓迫捷克西班牙兩代表維持公理、力說屈服日本、故其議决案縮短爲二頁、内容僅敷衍局面空洞陳謝李頓一行之勞力、倡以十九國委員會改爲調解委員會、邀請美俄參加案因日本反對、西門又受日之懇託　亦遂倡削除此項至於邀請美俄參加是否能告成功、須在十五日下午三時半之會議始能决定、據料十五日下午五時當能結束、爲日作倀之英外長西門、已於本日下午十時四十五分返英、一般人均揣料西門壓迫小國已成功云、（十四日華聯社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）英·　·捷克·西班牙·瑞士·五代表起草委員會、今日擬定提案與報告最後草稿、將由今日午後五時開會之十九特委員會考慮之、然後送交中日兩國代表、當起草委員會討論之際、日代表佐藤坐於隣室、而由起草委員時常京　、起草委員對於草稿内容、現嚴守秘密、但聞措詞甚爲温和、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會所推舉之起草委員會、日昨似遇有困難、其所草擬之决議草案、因而延至今日正午始可定局、十九國委員會即使能於今日開會作一决定、但在召集非常大會之前中日兩國代表亦必先向各該國政府請訓、因此一般人以爲非常大會在下星期之初、未必能舉行會議、至决議草案之内容、即將本年三月十一日大會之决議案加以申述而已、關於邀請美俄兩國參加一事、當由非常大會决定之、至調解委員會、須俟中日兩國覆文表示贊成後、方可組織、英外相西門對於决議案之起草、雖爲重要人物、却非由彼主持、茲西門已於昨晚離日内瓦、而以英代表喀干代行其職務、（十五日哈斯瓦電）</p>
<p>（東京）日内瓦電據聞十三日起草委員會草畢之决議案、全文僅兩頁、内容似簡單又漠然、英外相西門壓抑小國代表、排除不利日本决議之努力結果、顯然可見、其主要各點如左、㈠三月十一日大會决議之再度確定、㈡贊成李頓報告書對於中日問題之協定、與以最好資料、㈢提起調解委員會問題、但不言及邀請美俄問題、（十五日日聯社電）</p>
<h3>美俄參加問題</h3>
<p>國聯電華盛頓徵詢意見</p>
<p>蘇俄表示不願參加調解</p>
<p>（日内瓦）就現象觀察、蘇俄似將不願參加十九國特委會、至美國則須先獲悉對於調解中日問題之基礎條件、始允參加昨夜國聯己電華盛頓徵詢意見、（十五日中央社電）</p>
<h3>墨西哥通知退出國聯</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯秘書廳今晨接到墨西哥政府三日公函、聲明該國因財政困難、恐在最近之將來勢將無力繳付會費、故不得不退出國聯特照盟約先於兩年通知云、（十五日國民社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今日下午三時、駐日内瓦墨國代表訪特魯蒙、申述墨國將退出國聯、墨國雖以負不起國聯盟費爲理由但事實斷非如此簡單、據傳墨國已看穿國聯不過爲英法壓迫小國之工具、且完全被操爲歐洲聯盟、加入已無益、在精神上又有損、故不能不爽快退出、今後國聯之對中日紛爭如不能主持公理恐退出國聯不僅墨國一國云、（十四日華聯電）</p>
<h3>英方向我解釋誤會</h3>
<p>西門言論並無偏袒？</p>
<p>（南京）自英代表西門在國聯大會席上發袒日言論經我國輿論一致指摘以後、英國方面頗有醒悟、據確悉英政府方面已間接直接向我政府當局表示、西門在國聯大會所發言論、用意在促進和解、幷無偏袒任何一方之意、英國爲國聯忠實會員、對於盟約尊嚴之維持、决不後人、希望中國方面不因此而生誤會云云、（十五日中央社電）</p>
<h3>英帝國主義眞實面目</h3>
<p>英波油案</p>
<p>遽援用盟約第十五條</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會中國代表團方面、對於英國因英波煤油特許權之爭執、亟于援引盟約第十五條、頗覺英國躬自厚而薄于人、則以中國更有充分理由可以援引此條、而英國乃向中國建議囑其忍受日本侵略故也、一般之意見、英國與波斯僅有關于經濟問題之爭執、茲乃亟亟提出盟約第十五條、以爲對待、此舉在精神上、實可鞏固中國代表團在非常大會所處之地位云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>西門遄返倫敦</h3>
<p>日代表暮夜關說</p>
<p>（倫敦）英外相西門歸自日内瓦、今晨十一時二十分乘飛機抵倫敦、（十五日國民社電）</p>

<p>（東京）日内瓦電、日代表松平於十四日上午及下午會見英外相西門兩次、說明日本立塲、松平固始終與西門連絡、故西門回國後、松平亦於日内返英任地、（十五日日聯社電）</p>
<h3>魯省黨部慰勞三代表</h3>

<h3>日新渡戶博士努力對美宣傳</h3>
<p>里凡賽現在美國各地游說之日本新渡戶博士、本日在此世界事情研究會演說、辯護日本在中國及滿洲之行動、謂日本生命及名譽、現在滿洲問題危機存亡之境、日本在中國及滿洲之行動爲係正當、國聯對於遠東問題之背景、缺乏調解、故其審議亦不能公正云云、（十四日日聯電）</p>

<h3>美議員波拉贊成承認蘇俄</h3>
<p>美經濟凋敝有促成早日承認趨勢</p>
<p>中日間爭執亦可獲得實際的解决</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美參議員波拉、今日探詢參院内對於　速進行承認蘇俄問題之意見因目下雖已有數人態度確知贊成承認、但一般的意見、尙未能切實明瞭、據波拉今日語記者、苟非有若干參院領袖變換心理、則貿然討論此案、勢將徒勞無益、波拉又謂目前美國經濟之凋疲、與承認後對於遠東爭執之影響將爲考慮承認問題上兩大要素、國會此時必須爲美貨謀推廣市塲、而蘇俄至少可資若干種貨物之推銷、且信美國承認蘇俄後將可有安靖遠重爭執之趨響、因若美國能與蘇俄直接　論滿洲問題、渠信將日商得實際解决之較大可能性、再此舉於軍縮問題之　響、亦不可忽視、渠頗贊同蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫所稱、　有各國咸能同意後、始有軍縮　能之語也、（十四日國民社電）</p>
<h3>中俄兩外長互換復交賀電</h3>

<p>（南京）外交當局云、中俄已往條約、當隨復交而恢復有效、駐俄大使人選、待二中全會後任命、至中俄簽訂互不侵犯條約、與通商條約一事、尙須經過一相當時期、查民國十三年五月三十一日、北京政府外長顧維鈞與駐京加拉罕所簽訂之中俄協定、同年王正廷氏與加拉罕商定之㈠松花江航行條約、以互惠爲原則、俄輪得以行駛、㈡通商關稅以平等爲原則、㈢中俄邊界整理劃定、㈣　俄在中國境内不得宣傳共產主義、當賡續生效、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）外交界某要人稱、中俄復交、在目前國際形勢之下、對於遠東和平、確有多大帮助、不久之將來、諒美國亦將與蘇俄恢復邦交、至此則國際形勢、必爲之一變、在此複雜的國際關係轉變之時、吾人實有覓取出路之可能、但其先决條件、仍須自己能作最善之努力耳因兩國邦交恢復、在國際外交上亦只能互相作商業之帮助也、（十五日專電）</p>
<h3>首任駐俄大使内定顏惠慶</h3>

<h3>伍朝樞王正廷談中俄復交</h3>
<p>（南京）伍朝樞談、中俄復交、爲我國外交上之新開展、轉移國際目光、打開沉靜局面、大體言之、自屬有益而應做之事、國際的影響如何、此時尙不能預測、須知東北失地、非恃中俄邦交之恢復、即能驅出日軍、觀察一般國民之意識、如美總統之改選與中俄之復交、歡舞之忱、一若外交成功即可高枕無憂、豈非大謬、（十五日專電）</p>
<p>（南京）王正廷謂、中俄復交爲應付日前外交之要着、此事醞釀甚久、方始告成、在中俄兩國當然欣慰、在野心國家或因而忌憚、至此後英法對我之態度、是否改變、以慣例而言、因在國際間甲國與乙國邦交之恢復、照普通事根本談不到足以引起其他國家之注意、或所謂改變態度、予意英法兩國在我國商業上均占有重要地位、想不致自甘割棄固有之好感、而助紂爲虐也、但以過去與最近事態而論、在道義與公理上、英法均非仗義執言者、斯不能令人無憾、至美俄表示不參加十九國委員會、因鑒於國聯過去對於處理中日問題之處處迴避責任、至不能引起非會員國之樂於携手、凡評論不愼者、或謂國聯之用意圖卸責於美俄、斯言固屬過當、然亦未始不足以味嚼、然國聯爲本身計、更不應因美俄之不加入、而益示軟弱、王氏未謂、我國已失去數省土地、侵略者又無絲毫覺悟心流露、苟仍抱徒賴國聯之心理、而不自謀實力之準備、與舉國一致之團結、竊恐東北版圖、將永非我有矣、（十五日電專）</p>
<h3>俄報譏嘲日本</h3>
<p>復交僅爲鞏固和平</p>
<p>日人言論自相矛盾</p>
<p>（英斯科）蘇聯政府公報「伊士凡斯太」今日於社論中、評日外部發言人關於中俄復交之談話、謂日外部發言人形容中俄復交對於日本之恐怖與威脅、可謂盡至此中言論殊失日本外交家涵養鎭與與靜之風度、中俄恢復尋常邦交關係、並無特異之處、此舉固僅爲鞏固和平、造成安定之局面而已、且日發言人之言論亦殊矛盾、中國與蘇聯維持常能邦交、即爲「大錯誤」、而日本與蘇聯維持常態邦交、則爲完全正當、其間區别頗費人索解、蘇聯始終抱定一和平政策、願與所有國家維持常態關係、中俄復交即爲和平政策之一顯明表現、絕無其他異處、顯然一部分日本報紙之「恐怖」及「威脅」論調、已在日政府官吏之心理上見其影響矣、最後該報對日人所云中俄復交、减少日俄不侵犯條約訂立可能之說、表示驚訝、乃謂「此種言論是否表示日本將更製造新理由、以堅持拒絕蘇聯所提議之不侵犯條約、如屬果然、則此種言論尤爲矛盾蘇聯仍願與日滿訂不侵犯條約、如日本確抱有如其外部發言人所作關於中俄復交之見解、則可逕與蘇聯訂　不侵犯條約、排除所有之無稽疑慮也」云、（十四日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>海港檢疫成績</h3>
<p>賴各方之恊助</p>
<p>减人類之死亡</p>
<p>海港檢疫管理處、昨晚八時半、假座東亞酒樓、舉行第三週年宴會、到來賓唐海安·　洽卿·王　籟·等百餘人、席間由主席伍　德博士報告本年工作槪况甚詳、美總俄事克寗瀚致答辭、至十一時盡歡而散、茲將伍博士之演詞、紀錄於後、今晚承蒙諸君光臨賜敎、不勝榮幸之至、鄙人謹代表海漢檢疫處表示歡迎之意、在過去一年中、敝處一切措施工作、端賴領事團航業界及有關係之各機關恊助始得略有成績、來日方長、仍期高明時予指敎茲將本年工作槪况略述如下</p>
<p>（甲）吳淞槪况本年年首滬變突起、敝處吳淞醫官、先仍竭力照常工作　後不得已於劇烈砲火之下、始行退出避居上海、所有吳淞施診所隱附近之星宇、同爲砲火所焚去、所幸者浦東之海港檢疫醫院、尙完整如初、最近且已自設電燈、在吳淞辦公室原址、業已建造新屋、施診所仍在該處自本月初起、該所又照常工作矣、</p>
<p>（乙）檢疫工作自本年二月一日起、凡來上海之船隻、均於抵岸時舉行檢疫工作、此種辦法、尙稱滿意、對於航行並無延誤、卽如本年夏季霍亂流行之時每日所檢騐之船隻、約有二十五隻之多敝處檢疫人員、全體出外工作、成績頗佳、茲將自本年一月一日起至十二月十日止、在上海所檢騐之船隻及其噸數、開列於下</p>
<p>所檢船隻</p>
<p>艘　　　　噸</p>
<p>中國　一○八　　　一九六○九八</p>
<p>英國　七五五　五一三八三九六</p>
<p>美國　二一○　二二八七六七五</p>
<p>日本　七一二　三六六六八八○</p>
<p>挪威　一四八　　六四二四九七</p>
<p>芬蘭　　五七　　四一○二九一</p>
<p>德國　　八二　　六三一八四七</p>
<p>法國　　五八　　七二三三八一</p>
<p>其他　一一四　　七七○八七五</p>
<p>（丙）薰船工作敝處薰船科本年工作、亦甚形活躍、所薰船隻爲九七三三隻、艙下噸數爲一六一五四三一噸、所用薰船藥物、頗見功效、薰船時所搜集之死鼠本年共有二八六七隻去年覓二○八六隻云、</p>
<p>（丁）鼠蝨研究工作自本年初、敝處卽開始研究上海之鼠蝨、此舉於鼠疫問題、有重大之關係、自一月起至十一月底止所擒活鼠凡六九一頭、而自鼠身搜得之蝨、凡三一四一五五隻、然於所擒之活鼠、及薰船搜得之死鼠中、均無鼠疫菌發現敝處所屬之廣州厦門等分所、亦有同樣之工作、蓋受國聯衛生處鼠疫研究部之托也、</p>
<p>（戊）各科合作情形敝處防疫科薰船科醫務科、所有工作、均有連帶關係、今舉一例以明之、如某船自有疫口岸抵滬時首由防疫科醫官檢騐如發現霍亂、即將該船扣留、由薰船科消查、其病人及接觸人等、則由醫務科處理、幷施行預防霍亂注射及細菌　檢騐等手續</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>、俟各種手續完畢、卽將該船放行、此各科合作之情形也、</p>
<p>（己）購置新輪本處爲謀工作便利起見、業於去年開工起造一新輪、取名華佗、於一二週内卽可應用、連前共有汽輪三隻薰船汽艇兩隻、</p>
<p>（庚）設立檢疫分所敝處原有統一全國海港檢疫事宜之計畫、故天津塘沽秦皇島等處檢疫事宜、均已於四月間自當地海關之手、次第收回武漢分所、並已開始薰船工作、故武漢區域之船隻、頗感便利、厦門分所成績最　、足爲各分所之表率、當天花霍亂流行該地及其他各埠時該所均能在最短時間應付裕如、新移民所正在建築中、所添之新汽輪、亦已開始趕造矣、</p>
<p>（辛）防止霍亂流行本年霍亂流行之廣、及其凶惡之勢、爲中國史上所罕見、上海自四月二十六日已有霍亂第一例發現、最後一例、發現於十月十七日、計流行期間凡一百七十五日、患者共計四二九五人、死亡三一八人、内有外僑患者七十五人、死者二十人、故外僑之死亡率爲百分之二六、而華人之死亡率不過百分之七耳、華人之患病率、每千人僅有十人、而外僑之患病率每千人有十五人之多、上海能有此最低死亡率之良好成績、實賴各衛生機關羣衆努力、有以致之、敝處除檢騐船隻、同時幷注射防疫針不下數千人之多、</p>
<p>（壬）救護難民傷兵滬變時、難民傷兵紛紛由戰區移住公共租界及法租界、敝處　隨時派出醫官、隨同各團體努力救護、計有收容所五十六處、收容難民約二萬二千人、幷在梅白格路醫院參加治療傷兵及受傷難民之工作、按該院於戰事開始時設立、至四月底始行閉幕、</p>
<p>再有一點、鄙人須爲諸君述及、本年十月間上海市衛生局局長胡鴻基博士、覆車慘死、同人聞訊之下不勝惋惜、胡局長不僅爲衛生專家、卽對於公共衛生事業、亦頗多貢獻、如今昨兩年、預防霍亂之衛生運動、及鄙人所主持之霍亂預防所、胡局長所協助之處極多、其功績誠未可湮沒不傳也、最後鄙人所須聲明者、敝處所有工作、極承上海及各埠海關領事團航業界予以充分恊𦔳、而新聞界對於增進羣衆衛生常識之處、亦無不盡量登載、均爲吾人所深表感謝者也、</p>

<p>滬東引翔港三友實業社勞資糾紛、將近一載、雖經市府仲裁、法院判决、及各方善意調解、該資方均不接受、致延未解决、詎昨日上午不知如何、忽來暴徒二十餘人、將工人陳金堂等毆打致傷、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<h3>突來暴徒</h3>
<p>昨晨上午十時許、該廠工人正在廠内進餐之際、忽有暴徒吳炳義·鮑玉淸·楊昌林等二十餘人、身帶兇器、濳入廠房、不問情由、逢人便毆、該工人等因事前不知、故毫舞抵抗、致工人陳金堂頭部被斧破傷、周生富腰胸等部受重傷、吳松壽左腿骨被鐵棍毆斷、尙有數人受輕傷、</p>
<h3>拘獲兇手</h3>
<p>當毆打發生時、幸五區四所及駐廠警察大隊聞警、卽會同拘捕兇手、計獲楊昌林·楊明法·羅卽富·羅愛林·卜正財·張秀彩·林先壽·王學明·張華貴·駱聖福·等十人、當連同受傷工人一併帶所、</p>
<h3>移送法院</h3>
<p>經居所長訊問後、以案關刑事、卽備文轉送地方法院發落、當將兇手暫押、一面由法醫將受傷工人檢騐傷勢後、卽鐵自行投院醫治、聞檢察處已决定提起公訴云、</p>
<h3>七路公共汽車改路線</h3>
<p>便利西區之南北交通</p>
<p>公共租界公共汽車公司、爲便利西區之南北線交通起見、已得工部局之許可、將七路車更改路線、由海格路虹橋路口、駛至靜安寺、經極司非而路、轉入愛文義路、過膠州路、勞勃生路、小沙渡路、直至宜昌路口爲止、查七路舊線、到靜安寺後、係經愚園路白利南路而至五角塲、現愚園路一帶、旣有Ａ號車行駛、足敷乘載、故七路車可以改塗、</p>
<h3>公共租界健康狀態良好</h3>
<p>工部局衛生處長十一月份呈送董事會之報告云、本月界内、外僑死亡率爲一零·一七、去年同月爲一八·三四、華人死亡率爲一三·二三、去年同月爲一四·八零、故本埠之健康狀態、可謂異常良好、</p>
<p>傳染病稀少傳染病之統計、均無特别可注意者、惟腥紅熱略見增加、肺癆及腸病、其多如常、内白喉一項、華人之數頗高、而外僑之數則較往年此季爲少、天花症不甚多、但種痘工作積極進行、計月内由施種車施種者一四·六四九人、由各衛生分處施種者八·四一九人、</p>
<p>病理室研究本月研究之結果、知脾羅炎在屠殺之牛中頗爲普通、製藥股本月製成牛漿一百六十一格菌姆、發出痘漿三四·五六零份、微蘭漿一九九份、本月收入供微菌檢騐之標本一·二六一份、供分析者二三九份、分析工作、包含白喉·腦膜炎·瘧疾·等等、百斯篤治療室、本月求診者五十二人、内三人來自外埠、經治療者並無死亡、</p>
<p>食品之供給牛乳出產、平均每日二四·四二五磅、經施行檢騐之樣品三十六件、内五件不潔、二件缺少脂肪、一件曾攙水、三件係混入水牛乳、又經分析者九九件、内十一件不合格、但均來自乙級或未註册之乳廠者、本月屠牛數加多、他畜則少、惟均較上年平均爲高、各菜塲生意頗佳、麫包店及食品店頗有改良、</p>
<p>淸潔股工作時届冬季、除蠅除蚊工作减輕、而種痘則甚忙、本年蚊虫繁延、爲時頗久、殆因天氣較暖之故、爲檢查領補𦔳費學校之衛生狀况、已派一視查員專管此事、</p>

<h3>讀者顧問</h3>
<p>吳女士訊：我與某君由友誼進爲戀愛，已有三年多了，於去年承某中學敎務主任和國文敎員二先生，出爲我倆介紹，立一婚約合同，（我倆都已十八歲，照新公佈法律有自由配婿的權了。）各執一張，將後無論任何一方，决不能更動了，我倆今年託人，向我家父商量，不料始終不答應，唉！我眞進退兩難了，若是實行我倆的婚約，是我違背父母的命令了，若遵父母的命令，則某君爲了我費了不少的心思，我再在半途更動，豈非在天良上對不過他嗎？先生們呀！向父商量過不成，現在我想婚約實行歸實行，只要使我父女不生意見，將後仍是快快樂樂的，父女是父女，夫婦是夫婦，那　的法子，如何着手進行呢？</p>
<p>覆·來函所問，可分兩點答復：</p>
<p>（一）法律方面：依現行民法「未成年人訂定婚約·應得法定代理人之同意。」女士與對方訂婚約時·雖已有十八歲，但照民法第十二條：「滿二十歲爲成年」之規定·女士尙係「未成年人」。未成年人爲「限制行爲能力人」，「限制行爲能力人未得法定代理人之允許所爲之單獨行爲無效」（同法七十八條），故女士與對方訂定婚約，旣未得父母（法定代理人）同意，根本即不生效。就法律而言·女士此項婚約·實在並不固牢。但亦有相當救濟五九八號、</p>

<p>（二）人情方面：就來函推測，女士與父親間感情，定屬非常圓滿；果爾，如有人從中相當槫圓，必非無挽回之望。女士婚約，旣由「某中學敎務主任和國文敎員二先生」出面介紹而訂定，則敎務主任與國文敎員二先生，對於此項婚姻，必已完全贊同；可否即請二先生向女士父親疏通？以二先生之地位，似總可取得女士父親相當之信仰，而使之終於贊同也。</p>

<h3>爲全國中學校請命（一）</h3>
<p>— 廖茂如</p>
<p>自國民政府成立以來、中學課程已經修改了三次第一次在民國十八年、敎部曾召集會議　擬訂課程暫行標準於是年八月公布施行十九年暫行標準又經敎部集議修訂、本年八月敎部又召集高初中課程標準修訂會議、訂定高初中各學期每週各科敎學及自習時數表經便議通過在各報公布　幷通令各省市敎廳避轉飭所屬各高初中於下學期實行這次頒布的課表、與暫行標準之學科表及學分表比較、有數種大不同之點㈠增加每週授課時間㈡取消文理分科、㈢取消選修科目、㈣取消學分制、這個問題　關係中學太大了、我們不得不提出數種事實上窒礙難行之點、請敎部加以考慮、</p>
<h3>一，每週授課時間太多</h3>
<p>前淸初頒布的學制、規定每星期授課三十六小時、到了民國初年、不特中學畢業的年限减少一年、京是每週授課時間、亦减少二三小時　使學生多得自習機會、這不能不說是進步的徵象、至八年四月、敎育部咨准中學「斟酌地方情形、酌量增减科目及時間、」於是各校相率採用選科制、規定高中每學期修習二十五學分、直到現在、沒有多少更動、上次敎部所頒布的暫行課程標準、也以高中每學期修習二十六學分爲準則、民八的敎部咨文、實在替我國中學敎育開一個新紀元、作者自民八以來、沒有一日脫離過中學行政生活、關於選科制的爭執、分科制的利弊、各科目的增减、授課時　的分配、確有不少經騐可以貢獻、記得在東大附中的時候、我們常感覺到學生太忙、曾說過一句話、「又有馬兒不吃草、又要馬兒跑得好、世界上沒在這種兩全的事情、可是學校的行政人員、對於學生往往有這種奢望、」一方我們要學生多讀參考書籍、多做習題、多實地參觀、一方我們又要他們多運動、鍛練身體、多參加課外作業、增進辦事的能力、養成健全的人格、到了光華附中、作者仍有同樣的感覺、特别是高二高三的學生、沒有一個不喊忙、但是我們仍舊逼着他們參加各種活動、如淸潔比賽咧、時事測騐咧、學科測騐咧組會活動咧、編輯刋特咧、演說比賽咧、球類競賽咧、遠足旅行咧、實地參觀咧、研究會咧、音樂會咧、運動會咧、師生聯歡會咧、因爲我們不希望一個靑年到中學來讀死書、變成一個裝着僞知識的洋八股先生、不過學生雖然忙、對於功課的興趣、依然不弱、要是我們把課外活動一齊去掉、儘逼着他們讀死書、不單是書讀不好、幷且使他們感覺生活的乾枯單調、要引起無端的煩悶和不安定的狀態來了、我時常想怎樣可以把中學各科的敎材、鈎元摘要、集中訓練、一方减少學生的上課時間、一方增加他們實地的工作、養成多數「有爲有守」的靑年、我這個理想懐抱了好多年、却不道敎部反其道而行之、把中學授課時冁大大的增加、抛開了經騐不說、再從近代的趨勢來說能、近來美國的中學校、正在减少授課時間、初中約减至二十三小時一星期、高中約减至二十一小時一星期、我國現時規定課表、初中每週須上三十五六小時、高中每週須上三十三四小時、會議的先生們似乎祇顧到各科目時間的增加、沒有顧及時代的要求和學生的能力、時代的要求是什麽、就是學校應該提倡勞作、提倡課外作業、提倡自動的學習、不過這種種都需要時間、照那種課表、學生祇好一天到晚忙於聽課、那裡還有充分時間去自修、去研究、去勞作、去參加課外活動、抛開了事實不說、再就中外敎育家對於我國敎育所發表的議論來說罷、莊澤演先生在如何使新敎育中國化一書内、對於現代的中學很多批評、他說、「一般的中學、功課門類之多　令不識敎育或是初入學校的人看了要頭暈目眩、中學生眞是天之驕子、一會兒有先生來講地理、一會兒又有先生來講歷史、一會兒又有先生來講物理、一會兒又有先生來講化學、······愛聽的姑且聽聽、不聽也無妨、一課完了休盵十分鐘、談閑天、抽香烟、吃西餅······、」他主張需敎員上課敎的功課、祇保留現行課程中之精要點、學生須注重工作或調查、此外時間則在敎員指導之下自修、這一點與作者的感想頗有符合之處梁潄溟先生在今後一中改造的方向、演詞内說、「現在的學生、只站在一個被動和受用的地位、好像把學生時代看做是人生一個短期的預備時代、是專門讀書的時代、以爲像這樣有别人替他把什麽事都預備妥貼、他就可以專心讀書、但是所得的結果、却完全不然、不僅是他的書不能讀好、學問不能求得、幷且還把他變成一個不能做事的廢物、敎育的本意、是要把人們養成有本領有能力、如果要使一個人有本領有能力、京非發展他的耳目心思手足不可、因此梁先生在校裡施行一種生活敎育和自動敎育的方法、我們對於梁先生的話、是十分表同情、最近國聯特派敎育調查團來中國考察的結論、也說中學的授課時間太多　一有許多中學校的精神工作太嫌煩重以致引起學生煩燥和不安定的現象、太缺乏娛樂和戶外活動、太缺乏師生間親密的接觸、太缺乏團體的生活擔負社會責任的訓練袪除這種幣病的方法、在外國試行的很簡單、我們須牢記、兒童第一須當作兒童年待第二繼當作學生看待、所以學校生活不僅須適應兒童心神的需要、幷須適應他們多方面的天性、在實施方面、敎師與學生的關係不要太嚴正太疏遠、要鼓勵學生組織各種集會、自行管理、年長有能力的授以相當職權使他們有練習維持秩序和處理校務的機會、課外作業在學校生活中實佔一重要丨丨有時是非常的重要丨丨地位、在他國曾用的方法雖不必整個的移植到中國但我們相信中國總能找到一種適合中國情形的方法」這一段話、說得非常透澈、</p>

<h3>他們的路（二）</h3>
<p>— 藥影H.Barbusse作</p>
<p>不論火是怎樣起的，總之牠迅速而且不留餘地的把這房屋完全呑噬了。牠把屋内所有的一切全隱去了。水桶的效率只能於屋架傾塌下來的時候，使燒焦了的棟樑頭冷却罷了。大家把殘餘的東西堆在道路的兩旁，在灰屑中，只有那鐵床的匡架還留着人的樣子。······</p>
<p>可是當發生火警的時候，旣沒有一個人趕到脫羅藏去通知被燒房屋的居住者，事後也沒有人去通知過。</p>
<p>丨他們會及時知道的，一個饒舌婦人信口說。</p>
<p>丨是呀，勒密老嫗依然使着窒息而又單調的，味於眞理的呼聲應着。</p>
<p>當傍晚時分，把被犧牲者引回的傍晚時分到來時，村裏滿佈着一種感動。許多面孔，因爲好奇與恐懼的缘的，都呈露在暗黑的門口，隨後大家又聚集在廣場上，擠得密密地，連一個報信的人都不能通過······所有的眼睛都望着天，望着小山的巔頂，好像一羣囚犯，在黑暗</p>
<p>中聚集着等候流星出現似的。</p>
<p>丨看啦，他們在那邊了！加斯巴低低的切齒的說。</p>
<p>丨這是不可能的！兩個女人驚懼到了極點，不約而同的發出這樣的歎聲。</p>
<p>遠處，在紅色的高岡上，他們雙雙出現了。頓時大家明白他們並不知道他們的災禍。因爲他們還照舊以一種寗靜的步法向着那寥闊的空地他們那被燒了的房子的空地走去呢。</p>
<p>站在低地的看客騷擾起來了。那一對被判决了的人，雖然正向着否運給他們預備下的懲罰走去，但他們還在談着話，並且雖然離得很近了，他們還什麽都沒有瞧見。他們兩人的精神完全貫注在對方身上，他們已經成了與世相遺的人了。</p>
<p>他們走近了·走近了···忽然他們抬起了頭，望着他們的前面······</p>
<p>丨呀！人們爲着慈善的緣故，許可進來參與這事的一個乞丐歎息着。</p>
<p>可是在這時候，他們也還沒有看到什麽。舞疑的，他們的心思，正像他們在面對面談話一樣，完全集中在對方身上······他們以恰恰相同的笑容微笑着。有人看出或猜出這微笑嗎？丨這使得人類的臉孔添上美麗的，可憐的暗淡的旋渦？不論看得見或看不見，大家總以爲是這樣的。</p>
<p>經過一會兒，男子和女人在兩堆燒殘的東西中間不經意的穿過了：他們繼續走着，他們不能夠認出横在他們脚邊的東西，他們消失在另一邊，在太陽出來的那一邊了。</p>
<p>那些看熱鬧的人們的臉孔，現着驚駭而又莫明其妙的樣子，在半陰影裡揣測着。</p>
<p>女人愛還忒雖有着一肚子的話，但這些話太單純了，她反而說不出來：她只把她的嘴唇動了一下；但只要這麽一來，那勒米老熰便從容對她做着「是呀」的樣子······</p>
<p>······是呀······是呀······旁的人都這麽想。是呀，顯然的······他們是「别有所在」，那麽，他們什麽都沒有瞧見······是呀，他們的路坦然的舒展在他們前面，他們繼續走着，於是而已。是呀，他們沒有被他們的房子阻住，那是很自然的事情，因爲他們的房子已不在那裏了···</p>

<h3>「賭」敎育</h3>
<p>— 星子</p>
<p>在前天的報紙上，有兩椿關於「賭」的記載。一椿是一個庖丁因好打花會而犯竊盜罪入獄，在獄裏還喃喃念「王志高」「李月寳」等花會的名目，並頻頻向人探詢今日花會開些什麽。另一椿是一個黃包車夫因好打花會而將其所拉的黃包車及其妻代人所洗的衣裳一併典質作孤注之一擲，終於完全輸去而造成夫懸樑妻服毒的雙死慘劇。這兩幕關於「賭」的悲劇，在上海，本來是尋常事。但正因其已成爲一般人所忽視的「尋常事」，我們愈感覺得這「尋常事」實含有極其嚴重的社會意義。</p>
<p>本來，在我國，敎育之落後，已是無可諱言。但關於「賭」的敎育，則極爲發達，而且其設計與敎授法極盡循循善誘之能事。就以上海爲例；在上海，一個小孩到了六七歲的時候，衖堂門口便常有車糖之類的担子在等着他，母親隨時可以牽着孩子去學習這賭的初步知，識幷笑嘻嘻地告訴孩子怎樣才贏得一塊糖。再大一點，孩子長到九十歲了，當然這種幼穉敎育已不大合宜，於是衖堂口又早已擺有擲骰子之類的攤子在等待着，孩子也隨時可以從母親的手裏要得幾隻銅板去實際體騐喝么　六的滋味，假如父親母親陪客作麻雀消遣的話，則小孩更可由父親母親的事實敎訓之下，獲得對於賭的一種極正確的觀念和興趣。孩子再大一點，則大世界東新橋一帶的馬路上，儘有穿短打的朋友手裏舞弄着種種的博具在向人招手，而每一個游戲塲裏，也儘設有賭的專座，只要你高興，自可以隨時去嘗試。至於成年人，則關於賭的專科學校更多，有跑馬塲，有跑狗塲，有回力球，有輪盤賭窟，城隍廟裏陳列滿了麻雀骨牌之類，小烟紙店中更不時貼滿了××獎劵，「僥倖」的魔手把每一個人牢牢地抓住，只要你一失脚，便隨時可以把你擲向「男懸樑，妻服毒」的悲慘之深坑。</p>
<p>這種「賭敎育」如任其長此發達，則「懸樑服毒」的慘劇，亦自永永被視爲「尋常事」，然而，這眞是「尋常事」嗎？</p>
<h3>冬郊</h3>
<p>— 司晨</p>
<p>郊外，塘岸的一邊是田·一邊是水。水是那麽低，船張了帆在行，帆頂與岸相齊；田是那麽錯亂，田的中間夾着水窪·和一些不規則的墳堆。</p>
<p>下午的時間剛正過了一半，太陽已經儘往西面爬。而且爬的那麽匆促，這，我們從過往船上的帆上的陰影逐漸伸長這點上可以看出來。</p>
<p>有了風，扯起帆，一個人或是兩個人背了縴，船上的人可以在陽光下做别的瑣事，岸上的人脚踏着柔如羊毛一般的衰草叢，也是挺舒服的。</p>
<p>見了這些從田邊一直上來到塘岸的那些蔓生的衰弱的野草，便起了像孩子般的好奇心，田上沒有什麽，點一枝火燒起來吧·眞的着了，多快，陽光下的火燄看去是不大的，但那些白烟冒得夠多高。</p>
<p>茭白田變了水窪，一些殘留的軀幹歪船躺着。有人在另一個較大的窪裏摸螺螄。再有一些人佝僂着身子在泥田中挖荸薺。</p>
<p>有一個最最大的水窪，也許我們可以稱他是沼吧，成羣的鴨子在水裏游，在把頭探進水裏覓食，情景很熱鬧。忽然田邊那趕鴨的一聲唿哨，鴨子便像得了命令似的大聲呌喚起來。數目該不止五百隻吧，牠們邊呌喚，邊就爬上了田坎。看牠們就食時是那麽緊緊的互相擠着·多有趣！</p>
<p>漸漸的逼近夜晚了，太陽焂忽沉沒下去了，天邊只賸幾堆紅色的雲霞。半空已刻上了寒月的素影，晚鴉噪鳴着在暮色中找尋牠們的老家。</p>
<h3>「戀愛條件」之討論</h3>
<p>— 中傑</p>
<p>「戀愛是有條件的，」這是誰也不能否認的一個原則。否則人盡可戀，人盡可愛·簡直等於原始時代的亂交，根本談不上「變爱」！</p>
<p>但變愛的條件是什麽？即變愛以什麽爲標準？對於這個問題，本月十三日本談上韋紀女士已有解答，她所提的標準是高深的學問，高尙的道德，共同的思想，向上的志願，剛强的毅力，特殊的才能，强壯的身體，相當的年齡，溫和的性情。······至於金錢美貌，韋紀女士則認爲是卑鄙下流，不配列入條件。　　很顯然·韋紀女士的見解，是不大正確的，因爲假如世界上十六萬萬人，個個依照韋紀女士的條件去擇配偶，則至少將有十五萬萬人永永找不到他們或她們的對象！</p>
<p>我們認爲戀愛的條件只有兩個字，即是「相當」。無論物質與精神，外表與内在，必須但亦僅須「彼此相當」。無論學問，才能，性情，體格，年齡······以及韋紀女士所認爲卑鄙的財富，面貌也須相當。當然這裏所說的「相當」也决不會有「絕對的相當」，而只是「相當的相當」。假使一切條件，都「相當」，而某一條件尙稍有差異，則我認爲也是無妨的，因爲我們認爲世間的一切决沒有「全</p>
<p>美」與「全善」</p>
<p>財產，自然也應該列爲條件之一。我們不必「矯枉過正」；也不可離開現實唱空談。在資本主義社會，尙未崩崩潰以前，誰也不能超越金錢的勢力。無論你怎樣說，變愛是純潔的，偉大的，超於一切的，但社會的物質環境，事實上常支配了一切人類的行動和思想，哲學家卡爾曾說：「社會的物環境，支配了人類的意識：不是人類的意識，支配社會的物質環境。」變愛也應該站在唯物的立塲，不應該從陳腐的唯心論裏去找依據。</p>
<p>但我們並不是主張「財產愈富，便愈合乎我們的理想的條件」。我們只主張「相當」。總而言之：我們主張一切都有均衡的相當，才能，學問，見識，思想，志願，年齡，財富，面貌，都能相當，這才是眞正的變愛條件。</p>
<p>假使韋紀女士是一個學問高深，道德高尙，毅力剛强，才能特殊，性情溫存，······女子，則我對於她的意見十二分表贊同，因爲這樣的一個完好女子，理應有相當條件的男子爲偶，假使韋紀女士並不是像我理想中所想像一般，則她未免「責人也重以周，責己也輕以約」了丨然而，這並不是問題以内的話。</p>

<h3>時代与愛的歧路十六</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>大槪是在俄國飯館裏多喝了一杯咖啡，海泉睡在被窩裏，無論怎樣都睡不着。過了一忽又聽見下面的一陣鬨笑。</p>
<p>『他們幾個東洋鬼莫非是談論到我笑起來的。』</p>
<p>於是他又更加惱恨鶴子夫人了。</p>
<p>等到他醒過來時，窗口似乎有點陽光。他抬起半身來，向外面一望，果然今早晨的天色非常的晴和。他忙起身，穿好了衣服，便走下二樓來，想到浴室裏去洗漱。但走到浴室門首來時，看見門扉從内面緊閉住了。</p>
<p>『是那一個？』</p>
<p>他的聲音有點辣辣的了。但是裏面沒有一點回音。過了一忽，忽然聽見裏面一陣珂朗珂朗的咳嗽音。</p>
<p>『是那一個？』</p>
<p>他的聲音更高了些。同時他想，這眞是豈有此理。難道是曾先生昨夜裏回來了？</p>
<p>『對不住，林先生，請稍等一刻。眞的對不住了。』</p>
<p>鶴子夫人還穿着睡衣，從她的寢室裏伸出上半身來，一面揉揉眼睛，一面笑着向他點了點頭。她的聲音比平時更加柔婉，而她的態度也是像在說『這是萬不得已的，望你原諒我一回吧。』</p>
<p>他想，莫非她昨夜裏眞的那樣大膽留了那個日本男人歇在這家裏麽？如果是事實，那顚是豈有此理了！他特要詰問她時，忽然看見鶴子夫人的身後立着一個年輕的姑娘，穿着日本式的衣裙，頭髮披在肩背上。一雙純黑的瞳子灼灼地儘望着海泉。他從沒有看見過這樣美麗的姑娘。這位姑娘的臉色是何等的潔白，有如中秋的夜月。她的一身裝束也是十分入時，有如一團彩雲。海泉眼花撩亂起來了，一時說不出話來了。給這位美麗的日本姑娘一望，他忙收了他臉上的怒容，只裝出一副正經的臉孔，走回三樓上來了。</p>
<p>他整理了一下今天要用的書籍，再打算下去洗澡間解手。剛踏出房門，就看見一個秃頭的日本男人，約莫有五十歲左右，正從下面一步一步的走上來，身上穿一件和服，丨丨日本式道袍。丨丨海泉認得那正是曾先生在家裏時常穿的日本服。這個日本人何以這樣大膽，以這家裏的主人自居呢？他眞想走前去一拳打過去。但又怕惹起是非，只得忍住了。他看見那個日本人走到他的門首時，很謙虚的向他鞠了一個很深的鞠躬。他這個態度却把海泉感動了。海泉也忙回了一個禮。</p>
<p>洗漱完了後，回到自己房裏來時，看見自己的桌上有一個磁盤子盛着四片的杜絲麫包，一盅熱烘烘的牛乳。往日每天早上，鶴子夫人都是陪着他一同吃早點的。何以今天她特爲把他的一份送到這裏來呢？他眞想不出道理來，悶悶的不樂。</p>
<h3>期待</h3>
<p>— 蘆葦</p>
<p>是黃昏了，烟霧迷濛着。</p>
<p>我一個人孤獨的走出西門外，穿過一條滿是牛糞猪糞的街路，踏着輕鬆的脚步，帶着憂鬱的心情，一會兒，便到了楓林裏。</p>
<p>一片楓林，染了血似的紅葉，晚風輕輕吹來，便嗦嗦的作繁響。田畝上的一切農作物都收穫好了。我在一塊石頭上坐下。我的期待着的心情，是十分迫切的，我和他約好了，他在黃昏時候到楓林來，我在等他。</p>
<p>慢慢的在我的記憶當中，引起我少年時在這楓林中玩的許多故事，那時和我一道玩的朋友們，現在都分散了，爲了生活的壓抑，誰能把少年的快樂和忘憂的心情永久地把持着呢？我時常到楓林裡孤獨的坐着想着，悲哀總在囒着我的心。</p>
<p>這天黃昏，我約好了他到這楓林裡來見我，不曉得他能來不能來，但我是怎樣的想念他呵！我希望他來，我有話要對他說。</p>
<p>天色漸漸的陰暗了，楓林裏的黑影，逐漸擴大起來。</p>
<p>我的心悲苦起來了，他不來了呵！我這樣想着。</p>
<p>天是黑了。我不能不回家去。我不能再等，失望的嘆了一口氣，拾起一片紅楓，用綱筆寫上：「這是一顆飄　的心·」我把牠帶回家去。</p>
<p>到家的時候，媽懇切的這樣問我說：</p>
<p>「到那裏去了？我們等得你心急了！」</p>
<p>我沒話，夜飯祇吃了半碗飯，覺得要嘔什麽似的。</p>
<h3>打架</h3>
<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>一說到打架、阿这類的朋友一定會舌頭一伸，於此可知打架並不是一椿好玩的事，但是也有李逵者流，提起打架便滿身是勁，這種人當然不免有損君子之風。「君子」者，「文質彬彬之士也」，誰都願意做君子，於是乎誰也得勉强擺出文質彬彬的樣子。</p>
<p>中國少有李逵者流，而多有阿Ｑ之類，所以中國不失爲君子之國。然而阿Ｑ之類也不是完全沒有用的。當你在預備打他的時候，他能夠寛大爲懷，滿不在乎，你就吐他一臉的唾沫，他也笑嘻嘻的自己用衫袖揩掉，還對你陪不是，但是你再不甘心，居然在他臉上賞給兩個耳光，於是他只得駡你一句「媽的」，急忙退後三步，摸摸臉；不過他還會涎着笑臉說：「君子動言，小人動拳，你爲什動手打人？」當然，他比你高明得多，因爲他居然是君子了。其後，假如你仍甘以小人自居，趕上前去，殺氣騰騰，一定要打得他在地下爬不起來，這時候，他似乎實在忍無可忍了，馬上再退後三步，自你母親一直駡到祖宗三代，捲起袖口，拔上鞋跟，似乎立刻要對準你的胸膛一腦撞來。但敵人仍舊來勢兇兇，事情顯然是不很妙；於是他立刻又覺悟到「好漢不吃眼前虧，」而掉轉念頭，準備「長期抵抗，」使盡氣力高聲大喝道：「老子現在不和你打了，明朝，你等着！」這樣，他便一溜烟跑得不見人影。</p>
<p>所以，中國不致亡國，因爲這種人的確不少的原故。</p>
<h3>海的深度的測量法</h3>
<p>— 鏡</p>
<p>誰都知道爲了保障航行的安全，對於海的深度，一定要有精密的測量。</p>
<p>從前簡單的測量法，是用一條長繩，下繫一錘，垂直海中，等到錘着海底，然後計算繩之長短。這一方法到現在還被人採用。錘之下部，常刻一空穴，裏面盛着獸類的油脂，以便由於附着於錘底的具殼或砂土，而知海底的土質。</p>
<p>但是海洋過深，如深至幾千百米突的話，那末錘着海底的時間，便不易知道，而且因爲海水壓力太高，勢必要用大錘，繩亦須粗，於是在提出水面的時候，因着水的抵抗而增加重量，確是非常麻煩的事。所以現在多用電動測深器與反響測深器二種。</p>
<p>電動測深器的重錘上面，有一二尺長的細玻璃管，裝在一條黃銅的保護管中。玻璃管内塗着紅色的Chromium酸銀，以海水之壓力爲比例，其浸入海水者便變白色，於是計算這白色的Chromium酸銀的分景，便可知道海洋的深度了。</p>
<p>反響測深器，除了有着不知海底土質的缺點以外，對於天候與船之速力，都可以精密而簡易的測量。其原理甚爲簡單，卽是由於從水面所發出的音波到達海底以後更反響到水面的時間中，便可知水的深度。海水中的音波傳播速度，每秒約爲一千五百米突，那末一萬米突的深海，在數秒中便可測定了。</p>

<h3>二十一年全國棉產第二次估計報告</h3>
<p>丨比第一次减少二百七十三萬四千二百九十九担丨</p>
<p>中華棉業統計會於二十一年十二月十五日下午五時公佈二十一年全國棉產第二次估計如下、</p>
<p>（棉田面積三七、○七九、八三五畝）</p>
<p>（皮棉產額八、○九四、八六三担）</p>
<p>上項估計係根據㈠河北·山東·山西·河南·陜西·湖北·湖南·江西·安徽·江蘇·浙江·十一省及天津上海兩市之報告編製、㈡以十二月十日以前之棉作狀况爲準、㈢在十二月十日以前各省棉作所受災害之損失、業已計算在内、㈣棉田以畝爲單位、棉產以担爲單位、</p>
<p>茲將本年兩次估計與歷年棉田產額比較於下、</p>
<p>棉田面積　　皮棉產額</p>
<p>八　年　　　　　　三三、０三七、八八一　　九、０二八、三九０</p>
<p>九　年　　　　　　二八、三　七、二九　　　六、七五０、四０三</p>
<p>十　年　　　　　　二八、二一六、一六八　　五、四二九、二二０</p>
<p>十一年　　　　　　三三、四六四、五九五　　八、三一０、三五五</p>
<p>十二年　　　　　　二九、五五四、０五三　　七、一四四、六四二</p>
<p>十三年　　　　　　二八、七七一、五七七　　七、八０八、八八二</p>
<p>十四年　　　　　　二八、一二一、０二七　　七、五三四、三五一</p>
<p>十五年　　　　　　二七、三四九、七二七　　六、二四三、五八五</p>
<p>十六年　　　　　　二七、六一０、二七六　　六、七二二、一０八</p>
<p>十七年　　　　　　三一、九二六、三一一　　八、八三九、二七四</p>
<p>十八年　　　　　　三三、八一一、二五五　　七、五八七、０二一</p>
<p>十九年　　　　　　三七、五九三、０一二　　八、八０九、五六七</p>
<p>二十年第一次估計　三五、四六八、三五二　　　、七九三、二四一</p>
<p>第二次估計　三四、一八二、七四七　　六、四六０、六四一</p>
<p>最後修正　　三一、六三七、七七九　　六、三九九、七八０</p>
<p>廿一年第一次估計　三七、０八六、七七五　一０、八二九、一六二</p>
<p>第二次估計　三七、０七九、八三五　　八、０九四、八六三</p>
<p>本年棉產、本會第一次估計、達一千零八十二萬九千一百六十二担、爲近年之最大產額、實以黃河流域向易苦旱、本年則獲雨甚足、棉田發育極佳、每畝收量均逾　一百斤、南方雖苦雨寒、但大致亦稱良好、故全國平均、每畝能產皮棉三十斤（卽子棉一百斤）曝一百斤子棉之棉收、亦僅屬常稔、卽全國平均能有常稔之收成爲較難耳第一次估計發表後棉區氣候、漸告不良、與過去相反、北方雨水、由適當而過量、河水且多泛溢、冀魯晋諸多、均有被淹棉田、而早霜疊降、尤損棉收、册時南方則告亢旱、在第一次估計時、已有此種現象、八九月間、依然少雨、秋季風潮、爲江浙所必有、本年幸未發生、然因旱致有脫鈴落蒴、其影響於棉收者亦殊非輕、故在八月第一次估計前、南北棉區天氣均稱良好、至估計後一變而爲相反之情形、遂致可望常稔之棉收、逐步退化尤以湖北山東河北河南等省爲甚、湖北又値勦匪之際、對於　事、不無相當影響、比較良好者、惟江蘇而已故第二次估計結果、較第一次大减　、湖北减少五分之二、山東三分之一、增加者僅江蘇一省、所增亦屬甚微、綜計全國棉產、此次較第一次减少二百七十三萬四千二百九十九担之多、卽减少百分之二十五、而品質亦微見退化因北方多雨、正値結鈴盛期、北省棉產、素少黃汚、今年大增、山東河北、降霜尤早、棉業中通稱之「霜黃」亦多、以言南方、則開鈴期間、久旱少雨、棉果不能充分發育、未熟纖維、亦頗不少、故全國棉產品質、亦較遜色也、（下略）</p>

<h3>米市天晴步鬆</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日浦江來貨三四十號、本街去路呆滯、厚粳因常錫來電市價縐軟、划申較廉惟崑山貨仍平定、買戶因貨見湧、去路不佳、開盤降二角晚稻　帮辦去近千担、價與前日相仿、杜洋尖今亦見　交易忽懈、價小角餘、早稻來貨尙多交易全無、價用二角、蘇同帮到　二平、市無上落、（新閘）昨日各帮到船四十餘跛、城鄕交易　稻最多、行情穩定常鼐北粳及崑山米無人問津、丹陽江陰米非價跌不可、　善　涇早稻走銷尤滯、價小近角、埠杜尖客帮少數應酬、盤價站定、變陰元被厚粳帶小角許、</p>
<h3>蕪湖機元突漲三角</h3>
<p>丨囤户　辦贛湘米載丨</p>
<p>昨客秈形　頗佳、客元尤見起色、客秈有囤戶過問、胃口　連日已經明暗　成一萬以上、並在九江等產區購買、湖南長沙湘漂易俗河等區尤被囤戶注目據說該處米義多被上海南京等客戶探索　　、數額已　七八萬包之酌、故該處產價　大、此後勢難　划搬遷矣、昨本市又有囤戶收　江西機　九百七十包、價自八元二角半至八元三角半、比前日較大一角北洋　因河下米暫難裝運、又在市上試　湖南機紅米一百餘包價八元至七元九角客元米近日被閘　搜索已盡、到頭不旺昨新到蕪湖機元四百包即被　帮　數　去價乃突升三角之多、價九元三角九元二角半至才元不等此後本客囤買均有暢辦之意市面當可站住矣、</p>
<h3>遠期粉後市抛盛</h3>
<p>丨漢麥散倉貨又定五船丨</p>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份又趨平穩之態、以洋麥報價坎拿大雖仍小一角零芝加哥則好四五分、惟以匯率難低、且業外浮多鑒於現分之俏俐、買氣甚湧、各廠雖有抛售仍未能　　人、故各月份較之前日回好七厘半至一分不等、迫至下午開盤三月份曾顺補空甚亟、氣象甚佳、遠期因連帮吸收、亦見帶高、惟至二　後、又　紛紛回跌、以澳洲　又大批成交　倉貨共定五船、價廉至三兩三錢五分由　新定成三船、阜豐定一船、信大等合定一船、因此各盤中遠期均大批暢抛、數量　愖、惟　近期則依然維持、良係近期不　、遠期卽感難出耳、結果本月份較前日　二厘半、一月份小二厘半、二月份小一分二厘半三月份小一分半、四月份小七厘半、五月份小一分云、</p>
<h3>期麥市塲一無生氣</h3>
<p>昨期來上下午開盤後、大致呈盤旋之象、以洋麥報價、上落無幾、賣出一方非有洋麥之籌碼、卽不能活動、以各處本麥之存底、實在稀薄、來　之少、可想而知、全賣戶亦非有實在把握、亦不願道所以交易始終淸淡、一無生氣金日祇一月份初小二三分、後則回振、其餘月份上落甚少、結果一月份較前日好一分、餘均無出入云</p>

<h3>新潮靑後市看鬆</h3>

<h3>車頭自動開行</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨據報載·廣三鐵路，本月四日，忽然發生車頭無人駕駛，從廣州自動開往佛山之奇事，或者謂，因該車頭火力過猛，而車上汽喉，關鍵不緊，爲汽力所衝開，故可以不假司機，而自動開行，這也是「想當然」的說法，未必一定如此，因自有火車以來，未見有此特殊情形也。</p>
<p>近日我國希奇百怪的事，層出不窮，去年黃河淸，今年黃河狹，並翻出古玩食糧等物無算，又有某處天眼開，某處怪物出，此種事變，歷史上雖偶有記載，然亦從未有人目覩者，不意近日此種希奇的事，數見不鮮，則火車頭之自動開行，或爲離奇事變之一，亦未可知，語曰，天反時爲災，地反物爲妖，人反正爲乏，現在人事如此，造化小兒，何嘗不可以弄弄花巧呢。</p>
<p>幷且現在的世界，原是自動開車的世界，祇要你火力足，勢力大，横衝直撞，都可以自動開去，如日人之不顧公理，扯破盟約，强佔我東三省，反對國聯的調解，是日人之自動開車，國難臨頭，外禍日亟，不思抵抗外禍，不受中央命令，關了大門，拚命内戰，是軍閥之自動開車，捭闔縱横·鈎心鬭角，不念人民疾苦，不知國將淪亡，專門搗亂，不想補救，是政客之自動開車，自動開車之例正多，不僅廣三鐵路車頭如此。</p>
<p>中國人不但自動開車，幷且喜歡開倒車，車子祇有向前路，斷無倒開之理，但是中國人的車子，往往不喜歡向前開·而喜歡向後轉，所以憑你千變萬化，結果是愈弄愈糟，農村破產，民不聊生，而官吏不能救濟，反而雪上加霜，盡力搜括，剜肉補瘡，爲害尤烈，這呌做開倒車，軍人所以衛國，殺敵爲天職，而我國軍人，不能衛國，專門自相殘殺，這呌做開倒車，現在我國生活程度日高，生計愈困，而摩登的社會，拚命提倡奢侈，提倡娛樂，亦是開倒車，而廣三鐵路的車頭，雖是自由開車，但尙不至於開倒車，還好。</p>
<p>更就廣東政府言，似服從中央命令，又似不服從中央命令，一切事權，均似火車頭之自動開行，並不完全受中央命令之約束，則人事旣可以自動開行，火車何嘗不可以自動開行呢。</p>

<h3>馬鈴薯製造酒精法</h3>
<p>— 陳崇儒</p>
<p>製造酒精以馬鈴薯爲原料，造法分作四層如下：</p>
<p>第一層是蒸熟：</p>
<p>將馬鈴薯之澱粉，研成漿糊一樣，先將薯洗得潔凈，放在蒸籠内，蒸得極熟。大約中間之澱粉，都已糊化·再取出來·搯得極碎，裝在桶内。</p>
<p>第二層是糖化：</p>
<p>澱粉變糖·先要經過糖化，將蒸熟當南來當五個足月爲滿</p>
<p>父往往進長生庫</p>
<p>畸形的社會毛月蟾</p>
<p>子常常進跳舞場</p>
<p>月蟾</p>
<p>之薯，加上麥芽，這麥芽因有一種酵母在内，能將糊化之澱粉，變成糖質，所以加麥芽時，攪得極匀，攪和後，將桶用稻草包好，使桶中熟度·常常在攝氏寒暑表六十三度之時候，糖化最容易，大約四五點鐘·澱粉全變糖質，則就好矣。</p>
<p>第三層是醱酵：</p>
<p>醱酵是將糖分變成酒精，那時候熱度要低，常常在攝氏寒暑表十三度之間的時候，然後加上一種酒母，亦須攪得匀，遲至七八點鐘，待糖分變酒精時，熱度容易高，這數日中，極要注意。</p>
<p>第四層是蒸餾：</p>
<p>醱酵過之糖液，中間尙有許多雜質，要提出酒精，必須用蒸餾法，慢慢提出來，一次蒸餾·尙不十分純凈，須蒸餾幾次則就全是酒精矣，酒精用途甚廣，如製香水，花露水，以及藥水等爲不可少之物。</p>
<h3>明天交卷</h3>
<p>— 孫源</p>
<p>上課鐘已打了半小時，Ｗ敎受還沒有來，敎室變成了談話所，大家談着笑着，談女人講電影，這一片喧囂聲一直傳到辦公室的×敎務長的耳中，但他不敢來說句話，甚至張望也不張望一下、因爲他知道要是一踏進敎室，立刻會被同學們責問得啞口無言的·還是「識相點」充耳不聞好。</p>
<p>忽然·在幾個同學發見了Ｗ敎授！怎麽沒有聽見他的皮鞋聲呢，其實，這樣聲閙，怎能聽見呢。</p>
<p>談話聲笑聲漸漸的靜下來了，大家摸出康克令，或派克自來水筆，翻開了筆記簿，端正好了像要下筆千言一般的姿勢·同時幾十對眼睛都注視着Ｗ敎授好像不認識他·又好像要在他臉上找出什麽缺點一般靜悄悄的等着，丨當然其中也有好幾對眼睛是例外的，注視在别的什麽上。</p>
<p>Ｗ敎授今天行動似乎緩慢得多了：他慢慢地打開他的黑皮包，慢慢地伸手進去，又慢慢地拿出，·········</p>
<p>啊！不是書本，也不是講義，是一疊白紙。</p>
<p>啊！又是考試，討厭的考試。</p>
<p>「斷命考試」一位女同學輕輕的聲音。「今天月考」Ｗ敎授好似别人不懂要</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>考試，特地說明一聲，一面舉起了這疊白紙，像證明他這話不是騙人的，然後轉背在黑板上寫上試題。</p>
<p>「Ｗ先生·前星期剛剛考試，怎麽又要考了？</p>
<p>「照這裏規定每月月考一次」我們過了快三個月了，只考過一次，所以今天要考」。</p>
<p>「Ｗ先生，你上星期也沒有通知我們一聲，我們都沒有預備，怎樣考呢？</p>
<p>「不要緊隨便寫寫好了，我本來反對考試的，不過敎務處要分數單哩，」Ｗ敎授笑嘻嘻地說。</p>
<p>「考不出，我們不考！」</p>
<p>「不考！」</p>
<p>「不考！」</p>
<p>「噯！噯！你們不用着急隨便寫寫好了，這不算考，算我請你們做篇文章好了！」因爲「不考」的聲浪太大，Ｗ敎授提高喉嚨說了好幾聲「噯噯」但終是笑嘻嘻地。</p>
<p>「要記分數，不是考嗎？哈哈！」</p>
<p>「哈哈」</p>
<p>Ｗ先生，我們回去做罷，下星期交給你。」</p>
<p>「噯！隨便寫寫好了，何必帶回去寫？」</p>
<p>Ｗ先生，時間不早了，還是回去做罷！」</p>
<p>「噯！噯！在課堂隨便寫寫好了，不必帶回去做，」Ｗ敎授終是笑嘻嘻地說。</p>
<p>「那麽，就是明天交給你好了！」</p>
<p>「噯！噯！隨便寫寫好了！」還是笑嘻嘻地的。</p>
<p>Ｗ敎授終是走下講台把白紙一張一張分給同學們，前幾排同學有的拒絕收受，但經過了Ｗ敎授這樣說明「不論帶回去做，或在課堂裏做，紙終須要的啊！」之後終於收下了，</p>
<p>「現在就請諸位寫罷　　」　說　。</p>
<p>「噹噹···」下課鐘，</p>
<p>「那麽就明天交罷！」</p>
<p>咯咯的皮鞋聲隨着Ｗ敎授在敎室門口消失而消失了，繼起者是一陣哈哈的大笑，這笑聲代替了同學們的凱旋曲。</p>
<h3>拉攏來說</h3>
<p>— 彭年</p>
<p>天下本來是沒有親戚朋友，即使有：亦不過在出山得勢的時候。因爲親朋的情誼，都建築在金錢上面。</p>
<p>馬屁是最有價値的東西，倘若一個人沒有拍馬屁的藝術，就是你才藝如何精通，學識如何高明，終是附人驥尾，沒有做大老官的希望。</p>
<p>倘一個人保重公共物，和私物一樣，那公共物不會損壞了。</p>
<p>勞動階級的甘蜜時期，是在夜裏，貴族階級的甘蜜時期，却在早上。因爲勞動階級全在早上生產，而貴族階級還在做甘蜜的夢。</p>
<p>倘若全國婚喪費用，捐助難民，那難民至少可以得到一日的安慰。</p>
<p>我們如果認爲有國家的話，各盡一點義務，那東北三省不致被暴日奪去。</p>
<p>上海的廣告魔力，眞是比小城市來得偉大。因爲上海地廣人稠，同類的商號很多，所以顧客祇認報上的廣告，就是他所須買物的商號。</p>
<p>上海的女人，眞是滑稽。上身皮領大衣，下身短褲脫膝，大衣裏面，襯着薄薄的綢旗袍，這是何等的滑稽，何等的矛盾！</p>
<p>電車站旁的兒童乞丐，如果授予良好的敎育，未始不能在垃圾桶裏尋出珍珠寳石？</p>

<p>一個人生前如有訃聞所說那樣好，這中國簡直沒有貪官汚吏，土豪劣紳，㚥盜作爲的人。</p>
<p>一爿商店，經理先生月薪八十元，小伙計月薪只有六元，由此看來，好像只有經理有父母兒子，小伙計是沒有家庭的。</p>
<h3>人生？</h3>
<p>— 難公</p>
<p>楝驀然地光臨到我的寓所，這是出於我意外的興奮，愉快，同時他也很高興地滔滔地談着，由分别後的處境說到生活的苦燥，從社會問題談到國家大事，以致九一八慘案提到淞滬血戰，怨恨憤慨湧現於我倆的腦際，覺得人生是渺茫！尤其在這内慮外患紛至沓來中的我們，「國難」「家愁」所賜予的創痛！</p>
<p>「珙！你不知文是死了嗎？」棟悽然地告訴我·在他的睫眉間顯露着無限的惋嘆！情緒是幽靜了，同時一個菜色的黑瘦臉，團圓的眼珠，蘊藏在眉毛下的深凹中，高高地顴骨從不見到些微笑容的文，深印在我的腦海中，現在他是悲慘地消逝而永别了，不！他是到愉快的極樂世界去了！</p>
<p>文的遭遇的確太悲慘了，父親是在生他後的五年，抛棄了他母子而死别了，剩下的遺產不足給資產階級的一飯的代價·所幸他母親的刻苦操作，來維持着生活，而且又栽培了他幾年的學業，後來蒙親友的提携總算在一家商店中學徒，因爲家境的貧苦，很能勤懇的工作着，但不幸他母親不等他的供奉而竟步了他父親的後塵了·悲哀襲擊在他的内心，覺得幸運所遇的，太殘酷黑暗了</p>
<p>經過困苦艱難的掙扎，堅勞的奮鬥，把家基總算復興了，然而萬惡的病魔丨肺病緾繞着，爲生活的驅策，他沒有休養醫治的能力，微薄的收入僅夠妻兒的衣食，依舊在風霜中奔波路跋涉，在他不停的嗆咳中，時常能發現着塊塊的紅痰，愁眉不展的黃臉上，越發淸白而瘦小了，他明知這是催促生命夭折，步進墳墓的捷徑，但生活的鞭撻總於不能不使他奔走，不然！也是要成爲餓莩！</p>
<p>澹暗籠罩中的矮室裏呀未滿三歲的孤兒，蜷伏在他母親的懷中啼哭着，緊鎖了雙眉的年輕的寡婦，涙珠似脫了線的珠子，撲撲地下垂，俯視着文的遺像悽慘地涕泣！</p>

<h3>業餘組織的具體辦法</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>讀了洪明昌君一個小小的建議，他不只是消極的嗟歎，而且積極的想出辦法，這是很對的，假如一些靑年都有這種精神，不但他們本身的問題可以得到解决，整個民族的問題也就得到解决了。不過他所提出來的兩點辦法，而實際說起來仍只是一點，就是『聯絡感情，互相研究學問。』單是這樣空洞的辦法，仍沒有大用處的。究竟怎樣聯絡感情？怎樣互相研究學問？在沒有得到具體的辦法以前，怕的所謂聯絡感情，只是彼此認識，所謂研究學問，只是會面談談而已。所以我們大家要研究學問，一定要有切實辦法，換句話說：就是要有組織。在這裏，把我幾年來的一個意見提出來和大家討論一下。</p>
<p>去年我打算組織一個靑年苦學會，是想仿函授的辦法，不過不要學生納費，宣言章程已經草就了，跑去和幾個敎授先生們商量，自然他們平日也是高唱爲社會謀利益的，但是一提到要他們純盡義務的擔任這種函授，有的固然敷衍幾句，有的簡直說在上海這個地方，沒銅鈿是不好做事的。接後『一二八』事變忽然發生，我住的地方正在戰區，宣言章程的稿子也失了，自己因爲生活的關係，東奔西走，無形的便把這椿事擱置起來了。</p>
<p>現在洪君旣然想切實的互相研究學問，一定要有這種組織，不管組織的名稱和辦法如何，而不納學費的函授學校，是最適於貧苦靑年的環境的。雖然一些敎授先生未必肯幹這種純盡義務的事，不過以貴報的名義去聘請，他們或不會拒絕。萬一他們拒絕，那就要改變方法，即是貴報如肯負切實指導的責任，這個義務敎授，須由你們擔負起來。最好能專闢一欄，如：『靑年講座』，或『貧苦靑年的學校』一類。他們所提出的問題，替他們解釋；幷且呌他們怎樣研侒，或研究些什麽：有時幷可在一定的時間和地方把他們招集攏來·一方面作懇切的談話，一方面考察他們的性習如何，然後作進一步的指導。在目前中國的社會，學校成了少數人的專利品·</p>
<p>而大多數靑年都在那裏失望，徘徊，以至於墮落，自殺，這個敎育責任，一定要新聞界擔負起來，否則個人前途的危險，便是整個社會前途的危險，其關係是何等的重大呵！</p>
<p>自然，我上面所述的意見，也許有窒礙難行之處，然只要在這個原則底下，那方法的改變，是不成什麽問題的。</p>
<p>我是一個店員，我深感失學的痛苦，所以對於洪君的建議，是十二分的贊成，因此提出更實際的辦法來。但亦希望先生能給以圓滿的解决。</p>

<h3>寫信給友人之妻（續八）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>天下無論什麽事情祇要給你發現了一個小缺點，許多的大漏洞，便會絕不費事的一起給你找出來了。我先是僅僅乎覺得家居的無聊和煩悶，接着，後母的含有譏刺性的冷話，小兄弟們的胡鬧，······種種的不如意，竟一齊堆在我的眼前了。</p>
<p>勉强挨過了國曆的新年，我依舊握着一顆鮮紅而活躍的心，回到上海來了。征駒甫息，第一步就是打電話給你，唉！這一個電話一打，四五十天裏所下的一番苦工，便等於前功盡棄了！</p>
<p>有鑒於這兩次的失敗，所以臨走的一天，我的身子雖然是那樣的疲乏：渾身像火燒一般的燙，手足像死人一般的無力；但是我到底忍着痛苦，用大犧牲的精神，殺退了病魔，毅然决然的搭着京滬綫的夜車，丢下了上海，丢下了你的上海而走了。</p>
<p>除了你，上海原沒有什麽别的事物，値得我留戀的了。不過，髒送我的天眞的便是上海；使我能夠極眞切地認識人生底意味的，也是上海；憑空把你推到我的懂憧憬中來，使我在一生的過程中，添出這麽一節迴腸蕩氣，哭笑不得的帮事的也是上海。總計二十五年來，我所搬演的許多雜劇之中，最愉快，最悲痛，以致於刺激最深的，無一幕不在上海表演。因此，當這永别的時候，無論牠底本來面目怎樣的黑暗，怎樣的齷齷；我對於牠，却終不免有些黯然魂消了。</p>
<p>京滬綫的夜車照例還是十一點開出。我在十點四十八分的時候，才把我這疲弱得像煨灶貓似的身子，擠進了全仗大日本空軍彈下留情，始得苟延殘喘的半截火車站來。</p>
<p>所以遲遲到站的原因，並不是我的犧牲的勇氣受了什麽阻折，乃是我的良智突然有了更深一層的揭露的緣故。我覺得無論我的家庭對於我是怎樣的不値得留戀，我的老子，我的妻子，我的女兒，他們對於我，却畢竟都是站在債權者的地位上；愛的債權者丨我怎樣可以悄悄地一走，便把我的債務全卸脫得乾凈呢？</p>
<p>我本不預備留半個字给多的家裏，如其要留，那末祇有「罪該萬死」四個字最貼切，最眞誠；除此以外，要是再寫下去勢必完全出於矯揉造作了。與其這樣，還是不寫！所以良智儘發現，信却儘不留；信旣不留，那就不得不找别的足以代表留信的意義的東西。</p>
<p>這樣自然是祇有物質的安慰了。</p>
<p>去年，我不是寫過一部「國際貿易的觀察，」由××書局發行的嗎？在那原稿上，親愛的小朋友，我還記得，你也寫過好幾行字咧丨這一部朱近赤畢生唯一之大著的代價，雖然巳經像講人命似的爭到了八百元的數目；但是後來介紹人他往，這筆錢便始終不曾到我的袋裏。我本可以就此放棄了這一些小小的權利。在我，這一些犧牲，到這時候，已經是斷不會再發生半些感覺的了，可是，我爲着要圖報老父及妻女之恩於萬一起見，祇得對不起那位大老板了。我就用着極嚴厲的手腕，在四五小時之内，把這八百塊好洋錢收了回來；連帶我所遺下的許多衣帽，一齊做了我臨去時的遺產。也許此刻我家裏的人已完全領到了。</p>
<p>這樣的一番處置，究竟能不能使我的老父妻女得到一些的安慰，或是因此反格外增加他們的痛苦，我却管不得了。</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>說說「玉容禍」</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>南京大戲院昨日開映的，「玉容禍」Convicted名稱是多麽香艷？但是内容並不那麽香艷，眞不如用直譯或一個帶偵探意味的，切實些。</p>
<p>内容是這樣的：在一隻輪船上，有一個孤身女優，被兩個男子追逐着，一個是音樂師；一個是大偵探，實然那音樂師被殺了，證據很明顯是那女子謀死的，但是大偵探用盡了方法，捉出一個眞兇，丨原來是船上的一個職員，因財帛上的仇恨，而行的兇丨於是那偵探與女優，竟成良伴。</p>
<p>這部影片，還不能說壞，許多小片段：旣寫偵探，又同時得寫愛情，面面顧到，當然不是容易的事。</p>
<p>男主角傑姆孫湯美斯JamesonThomas的沉默口才舉動，都不失一個大偵探身份，但是表情不夠的地方也有，女主角愛蓮潑琳格AileenPringle工夫是不錯，雖然只有不多的特寫，倒還很好，不過劇中硬指她爲女優，却不大合宜，我想：如果她只是一個旅行中的女子，或是赴職去的職員，就好多了，因爲她實在沒有女優的「功架，」飾樂師的利却丢克爾RichardTucker是很可取的，表演反派角色的個性，可以稱一聲「熟練，」丨還有許多配角，倒還都可看。</p>
<p>一部影片，常常照一些海景，不忘是輪船上的故事，又有奇巧的枝葉穿挿來調劑，這固然是導演的細心，但是他丨導演丨却疏忽了大體，有這樣的劇情；有稱職的演員；他却使可以緊張的，成了平凡，這片的中心，旣然重在「偵探」上，有不少地方，用技巧可以攝成有刺激性，有神秘性的佳作，但是一切，都被他一手破壞，非常可惜。</p>
<p>配角多：而且配角的職務也繁，所以主角常常被湮沒，把觀衆的精神，弄得鬆弛，影片也大爲散漫。</p>
<p>發音是不錯，也並不冗長，但是南京昨天第一塲，前四本沙聲甚多，竟有放音機將聲帶捲傷的地方，我相信，這不是片子的毛病，南京的機器房，應當小心些。</p>
<p>大致我以爲可看，但是她决不會像廣告上一樣給你緊張的顫動，也沒有「奇離曲折」的「五里霧」放在你面前。</p>
<h3>吾其爲魚乎</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>好萊塢有一句俗話說：「如果海島沙岸上的美人魚，眞同格勞瑞絲蒂華特GloriaStuart,所扮演得一樣美麗，那麽全世界的男子，都會加入海軍，去作一個小水手亦情願的。的確是的，她的健美和閃燦的金髮，都是足以呌任何人傾倒的。</p>
<p>在最近，好萊塢許多人失望了，因爲她已經和一位已成功的靑年彫刻家結了婚。當然然呌任何人嫉妬和羨慕啊。</p>
<h3>小范朋克與瓊克勞馥</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>小范朋克和瓊克勞馥，是人人知道的，好萊塢最出名最完滿的一對夫婦。雖然許多報紙替他們反宣傳說是要離婚，但是好萊塢這種汜濫的潮流對他們夫婦尙沒有波及過，小范朋克是屬於聯合公司的，最近主演片子是上月卡爾登映的「戰地之愛」瓊克勞馥却是米高美公司的基本明星，最近在膠片上留影的是國泰映的「林頓姑娘」和行將運來海上的「大飯店」他們夫婦二人却從未合演過今年美國總選舉，數萬人中瓊是副座皇后。</p>
<p>影台韻事</p>
<h3>「遺貌取神」丨瓊克勞馥的摹倣葛雷泰嘉寳</h3>
<p>— 橄欖</p>
<p>葛雷泰嘉寳深刻的表演，濃厚的情緒，富有蠱惑性的動作，凡是看過她所演的片子的人，都刻着不可磨滅的印象。</p>
<p>好萊塢摹仿她作風的人是很多。但是大部份都是「遺神取貌」，毫無神趣。瓊克勞馥積多年的努力，是能得到嘉寳的神韻了。</p>
<p>她能把嘉寳的優越佳妙的，與她適合的取來應用，而放棄一切不適合的。即如嘉寳的頭髮，是爲人們所稱許的，而瓊克勞馥因爲她的臉形眼睛，同嘉寳差不多，所以她採取嘉寳的式樣。而在對白部份瓊克勞馥知道她生澀的美國口音，要比嘉寳沙啞的音節要受聽的多，所以她仍然用她的本音。</p>
<p>在實際上，在批評家的眼光中，瓊克勞馥確是一個能模倣嘉寳而得她神韻的人。瓊克勞馥不但硬學嘉寳，她能把她自己個性未充分的發展。在每一部新片子中間，無論什麽人都可以注意到她的驚人的進步。據說在（大飯店）片中，她能有嘉寳同樣的表演了丨</p>

<h3>閻將軍的苦茶」（上）</h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>好萊塢攝製關於中國社會的片子，像瑪琳黛德麗的「上海快車」，或羅克的不怕死，因爲有許多失實或過火之處，所以中國人看了，總覺得人家是有意侮辱我們民族，非打倒不可。</p>
<p>這種思想，早就埋伏在我們腦海之中。「閻將軍的苦茶」攝成的消息，傳到中國來，我們在未悉其内容前，心裏終覺得有些懷疑，究竟其中有沒有侮辱我國的地方？</p>
<p>現在ScreenRomance十一月號，已經把牠的全文發表，詳細讀了一遍後，我覺得還沒有不利或侮辱我國的地方。</p>
<p>牠的情節是這樣的：有一個呌MeganDavis的美國女郎，從波士頓到上海，預備來和她從前同學時的情人，上海的一個敎士Dr.RobertStrike結婚，當時閘北恰巧有戰爭，Strike博士爲了救濟難民工作繁重·婚嫁因此延期。她允許了，幷且自己也參加救濟工作。</p>
<p>一天，她和Bob等出發救孤兒出險，不幸給亂兵衝散，她也被他們擠倒，而暈過去了，醒來的時候她已在閻將軍的府裏，那邊她遇見了閻將軍他那呌瑪麗Mrh-Li的妾媵，因爲路上不靖，所以閻將軍把她留着。</p>
<p>瑪麗爲私通了一位副官，被閻將軍判决，次晨就要槍斃，Megan悲　她的身世，憤恨閻將軍的暴虐，代她到閻將軍面前去祈求寛赦，閻將軍告訴她道，「這也並非因爲我的妒忌或報復，實在因爲她有洩漏軍事秘密給敵人的嫌疑」，經過了相當時間的談話和懇求，閻將軍終久答應了，但必須Megan做質人。</p>
<p>溫柔的閻將軍，竟打動了Megan的心，此後Megan並不覺得閻將軍的暴虐，像他以前腦中所想像的中國軍閥，他們二人間，已發生了一種友愛之情。（未完）</p>
<p>影界調查</p>
<h3>三大公司的面面觀</h3>
<p>— 吉伸</p>
<p>論到國產影界，當以聯華，，天一，明星，爲三鼎足。今記者不患細詳，烴一錄出，爲影𨖼告，識者幸勿以我爲多事也。</p>
<p>㈠資本方面：在經濟破產的中國電影界裏，天一聯華明星總算是個中翹楚了。在最初聯華本定資本二百萬，但實收還不及二分之一，遇有短少，完全由羅明佑個人負責。目今隷屬於聯華者，港滬平共有五大攝影場，統計資產，已超百萬之上。明星以資格淵源之深長，歲歲之盈餘，經濟狀况，亦頗完美。牠們的組織，不像聯華　的有羅君個人負責，資本額的多寡，完全看認股者的踴躍與否。在緊迫的當兒，也有董事會來臨時設法。至於天一公司，牠原是老　邵醉翁的個人家產。所以要聞天一的資本如何，只要看邵老　的私產如何；在目下天一的資本額，也已經超上了五十萬國幣。</p>
<p>㈡營業方面：在京津平滬漢港這幾處通商大埠上，那末無疑地聯華是坐下了第一把交椅，尤其是所謂代表上的那部「人道。」在北平向不開映國片的平安戲院，居然也會得破例一映。本埠向不開演默片的新光也會得七日不算，再加三天。輪到光華，竟連映十七日。可是聯華片子一到南洋，那就大大的不妙，轟動一時的「戀愛與義務，」在開映的時候，樓上下竟然找不到十人，（羅明佑去年在聯華的報告。（明星的片子，因爲很合中下階級的胃口，在營業上的確很佔優勢，一班商人奶奶們，更感覺到非明星片不辦，過去的，火燒紅蓮寺」就是國產片中賣座最盛的一張，而此次當局滿擬大得其利的「啼笑姻緣，」倒反平平。至於天一的片子的營業，在大體上，總算是形勢尙好，不過較了去年他們方攝有聲片的時候未免有些退步。</p>
<p>㈢人材方面：關於人材，聯華多新進，明星多舊有，天一的多舞台上的新劇角色。不過在最近，明星同天一，也都在奮發圖進，亟力的造就人材。導演的數量，聯華有十一位，明星有八位，天一很寥落，最近李萍倩又脫離他去更見蕭索。編劇的同攝影的，那倒尙見平均，無甚顯别。</p>
<p>㈣出品方面：出品最多的，那末要算明星第一了，天一同聯華，爲數亦不少，若以每年統計起來，聯華　不亞於明星，但聯華有五大攝影場而不能超越過只有一個攝影場的明星。關於這點的次序，排起來是明星天一聯華。</p>
<p>㈤成績方面：要說一公司的成績，必須的要從大體方面着想，所以關於影片的成績方面，聯華是穩坐了頭位了。由「故都春夢」以至於最近的「奮鬥」我們就可以充分的明白，聯華片的確是較爲佳妙。明星的片子成績，最大的劣點，就是在不前進而守舊，始終是保住了老牌的態度，不過他們也有他們的好處，就是不會得產生很糟的劣片。至於天一的成績，比了以前雖覺遜色，不過根據着最近的趨勢，三公司都已有向上奮勵的决心，大家都在抓住了藝術，跟着了時代，向成功的途逕進發。</p>
<p>其他關於三公司的各方面問題，正多得不可數計，改日再來報告給讀者們罷。</p>
<h3>高占非將赴香港</h3>
<p>— 星宿</p>
<p>高占非原是聯華公司第二廠的基本演員，現在又兼着在亨生公司攝製的有聲片「春潮」中，担任主君，工作委實很忙。聯合公司在上海聘請演員時，他也在被請之列·幷且合同也已簽定，可是聯合所請的許多導演和演員，如今都已到了香港，預備開始工作了，只有他爲了聯華和亨生兩方面的戲，都還未曾結束，不能動身，聯合已向他催促過好幾次，他委實不能再遲延，所以决定在十七日起程赴港了。已致函給聯華和亨生，限定他的戲，在十五日以前攝竣。</p>
<p>電影專著</p>
<h3>好演員必具的資格</h3>
<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>對於你的每一種微妙的表情，你要能夠自由節制與操縱。這是每一個好的演員必須具備的資格。這也是表演藝術家獨有的能力。凡是人類誰不能笑？誰不能哭？人人都能夠哭笑。人人都能夠在必要的時候做出相當的表情。人人都能夠在無意之中做出極美而且極富有藝術意味的表情。爲甚麽他們不能稱爲表演藝術家？只有你能夠在銀幕上享有這種勞譽？這就是因爲你能夠對於自己的每一種微妙的表情有自由節　制與操縱的能力，而沒有受過訓練的人是不能夠的。</p>
<p>我們剛練習過的哭，與笑雖然是最基本最單純的表情，但是要練到能夠自由節制與操縱的地步却並不是一件容易的事。你要哭得像眞哭·笑得像眞笑，你當然是不能不動心的。但是一動心，你就失去了自由節制的能力。這是不待試騐人人都能明瞭的一件事。譬如你在演有聲影片的時候，你笑開了頭，再也不能按着導演的預定計劃，在若干秒鐘以内陸續說話，或是做另一種表情，或是哭得涕泗滂沱，無論如何不能按着預定的計劃繼續工作，公司方面便要爲你蹧蹋許多膠片。這還是好的比喻呢。如果到了該哭的時候你哭不出·或是該笑的時候你偏不笑，這種損失就更大了。如果常常要使人受到這種損失·你還好意思聽人稱你爲藝術家嗎？</p>

<h3>Yu Youren's Opening Speech</h3>
<p>Yu Youren's opening speech said, "Comrades, today is the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee. I am honored to deliver this speech by the order of the Central Committee. This meeting is originally a routine meeting, but the people, in view of the urgency of the current needs, hope that this meeting will be a great success. Therefore, we should regard this routine meeting as a special meeting. We recall that on this day last year, we were facing internal and external troubles, natural disasters, and man-made disasters. The people of the country were panicked, and the Party and the government presented a phenomenon of division. Therefore, suspicions among comrades and accusations from the people came one after another. Those with other intentions took the opportunity to try to overthrow the Party's regime. At the same time, in the international arena, all countries were watching intently to see whether the Chinese Kuomintang, which built the Republic of China with the Party, could maintain its regime and preserve the survival of the nation and the country at this critical moment. But after such a big wave, with the efforts of the advanced members of the Party and the appeals of the people of the country, we finally understood each other, made concessions to each other, united sincerely, turned danger into safety, and passed this dangerous juncture. The Fourth National Congress was convened in Nanjing and Guangdong, and the motions decided by both sides were collected in the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee. After careful discussion, the power of the First Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee was unprecedented. At this time of national danger, it was the time for the comrades in the Party to bravely face the difficulties. Since the First Plenary Session, all Party and government departments have been reorganized once, and we have moved forward according to this principle. By the time the Second Plenary Session was held, the patriotic compatriots in Shanghai were fighting against the enemy. At this time, the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government were relocating, both to avoid threats and to decide to resist. The Second Plenary Session held in Luoyang discussed and decided on Party affairs, military affairs, and politics, so that Party affairs, military affairs, and politics could show a vigorous and progressive atmosphere day by day. Why should we hold the Third Plenary Session now? Although the Third Plenary Session is a routine meeting, it is very necessary. The first reason is that we have achieved great victories in suppressing the Red bandits. Because of the victory in suppressing bandits, the reform of politics, the reorganization of the army, and the relief of rural areas must have further plans. Only in this way can our victory be maintained forever. Not only that, but we must also make the Three Principles of the People deeply imprinted in the minds of the general public and infused into the society. The second is our struggle in the international arena. Our delegation to the League of Nations, after a long period of hard work, has won the sympathy of the world and will never give in or fail. At the same time, after the resumption of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations has been achieved, the guarantee of peace in East Asia may be further improved. Therefore, at this time, it is even more necessary to hold a meeting to review the real situation of our diplomacy and to decide our national policy. There is also one particularly important thing, that is, the sincere unity within the Party. Since the First and Second Plenary Sessions, we need to further strengthen our sincere unity, so that everyone can be of one mind and work together to concentrate the spirit and ability of the Central Committee comrades in the Central Committee and enrich the Central Committee. I also hope that the cases discussed and decided by the First and Second Plenary Sessions, which have not yet been implemented, can be implemented in the future. As for the comrades who have good opinions on saving the country and saving the nation, I hope that they will contribute to the Central Committee at this meeting, so that the Central Committee can adopt them and unify our work process, so that the progress of the country and the nation can be given a better new method. I recall that since the national crisis occurred last year, because of the rumors of external reactionaries, some comrades in the Party were also shaken and uncertain. Now, I can loudly tell the people of the country and all the comrades in the Party that Sun Yat-sen said that the Three Principles of the People are the doctrine of saving the country. The country has reached this dangerous point, and only the Three Principles of the People can save China from danger. Only the Three Principles of the People can bring the country back to life. Only those who believe in the Three Principles of the People can save China. Only the followers of the Three Principles of the People are truly those who sacrifice themselves to save the Republic of China. Therefore, the followers of the Three Principles of the People should always strive for the Three Principles of the People. The gain from this struggle is the survival and glory of the Republic of China and the Chinese nation. Therefore, I hope that all compatriots in the country and all Party members will relieve the disaster and save the country under the belief of the Three Principles of the People. I believe that the current Party and government departments will be able to work hard, overcome all difficulties, and create a new Republic of China, a new Republic of China based on the Three Principles of the People.

<h3>All Central Committee Members Feted Chairman Jiang</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) All Central Committee members in Nanjing feasted Chairman Jiang at the Lixingshe (a club) on the evening of the 15th to express their appreciation. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Increase Bond Fund Allocations</h3>
<p>Photograph of the opening of the Third Plenary Session in Nanjing (Taken by Guanghua)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee Members Yang Hu, Zhou Fo Hai, and more than ten others jointly proposed to increase bond fund allocations and repay the principal in advance to strengthen credit and benefit construction. The case has been sent to the Secretariat of the Plenary Session. The reporter immediately inquired about its main points yesterday. It was said that since the Shanghai Incident, finance has stagnated, and the prices of public bonds and treasury bills have plummeted. Although a method has been agreed upon to maintain it with difficulty, the people's confidence in the national public debt has not been fully restored after all. Government construction has been somewhat affected. In order to consolidate credit, the government should take advantage of this relocation and the gradual stabilization of the political situation and the temporary increase in tax revenue, and automatically from January of the 22nd year, in addition to the original allocation of 8.6 million yuan for the bond principal and interest fund each month, increase the allocation by another 3 to 4 million yuan, according to the method stipulated when the bond principal was repaid and restored to issuance, and repay the principal on schedule without continuing to extend the deadline. If this is the case, the government's painstaking efforts to maintain bond credibility will surely be understood by the people, and cooperation in construction projects will surely be more promising. As for the detailed methods, the National Government can separately hand them over to the Ministry of Finance for detailed drafting. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Proposes Raising Funds to Redeem the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jiaoji Railway was recovered by the state in the 11th year of the Republic of China (1922), and owed Japan 40 million yen. At that time, personnel were sent to sign an agreement, stipulating that China could repay the price at any time within 15 years after 5 years, with an annual interest rate of 6%. The railway has repeatedly formulated fundraising plans, but has not yet realized them. There are still five years left before the redemption deadline. The chairman of the railway, Wang Zhengting, believes that the current low price of Japanese gold is an excellent opportunity to prepare funds to redeem the railway. He has drafted a fundraising plan proposal and submitted it to the Plenary Session for discussion. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Wu Chaoshu Proposes Three Motions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaoshu submitted the following three motions to the Third Plenary Session: (1) To quickly establish a public opinion organ to bridge the gap between the central government and the local people, and to allow representatives from the people of each province to participate in central political opinions and implement democratic politics, and to promote its realization within the shortest possible time of three to five months. (2) To uniformly reduce the army nationwide, to formulate a plan to uniformly reduce all troops nationwide, regardless of their quality, for example, reducing each division by one-third or one-quarter as a standard, and to find ways to enlist those who are reduced into the military industry, develop the Northwest, and revive the countryside, to work for national production. (3) To reduce the size of provinces for the convenience of autonomy and all administrative measures, which is a continuation of the old case of the 19th year, reiterating the previous statement. Chen Gongbo and others have countersigned the above three cases. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>The Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Party Rectification Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Fan Zhengbo and Wang Guanying, members of the Standing Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Party Rectification Committee, went to Nanjing on the 15th to report on Party affairs in Jiangxi to the Third Plenary Session. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Zhao Daiwen Leaves Shanxi to Come to Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian said that Yan is organizing the Shanxi army and is unable to come to Nanjing to attend the Third Plenary Session. Shanxi has a total of seven infantry divisions and three brigades of cavalry artillery. Zhao Daiwen has left Shanxi and is heading south to attend the Third Plenary Session and is expected to arrive in one or two days. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Representatives of Private Power Companies Petition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Federation of Private Power Companies sent representatives such as Ding Guazhi to the Third Plenary Session to petition on the 15th because the Guangzhou Municipal Government took over the Guangdong Electric Power Company, which has a capital stock of over 10 million, into municipal ownership in July of this year. The government approved a patent for 30 years and registered it with the National Government. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Gesang Zeren Talks About the Kangzang Dispute</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Gesang Zeren spoke, "Having been ordered to go to Kang, I immediately heard that the Dalai Lama was preparing military aggression against Western Kang. Therefore, I took some precautions. However, Liu Wenhui had some misunderstandings, which led to conflicts with our army. All kinds of one-sided words were spread by the Sichuan side, causing the people of the country to blame me. Later, after mutual understanding between the two sides, the matter came to light. The defense of Kangzang is the responsibility of Ma Bufang of Qinghai in northern Kang, and the Sichuan army is responsible for central Kang. Our army guards southern Kang. Therefore, the Dalai Lama has repeatedly attacked, but all three sides have been repelled. At present, the military situation can be temporarily brought to an end. Regarding the political aspect of Western Kang, because of years of incessant military operations, no one has organized it. In short, it can be said that there is no clue. Although I tried my best to promote Party affairs, they were neglected due to the instability of the people's hearts. Taking advantage of the opportunity that the Kangzang military situation has been settled and the opening of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, I have come to Nanjing to report the detailed situation to the Central Committee and submit it in writing to the Third Plenary Session. In short, the people of Kangzang have realized that Kangzang is the Kangzang of the Central Government." (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<h3>Internal Affairs Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong Delivered the Closing Speech.</p>
<p>Declaration Issued (Outlining Important Parts of the Resolutions)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Internal Affairs Conference held its seventh general meeting on the morning of the 15th to discuss 32 proposals regarding the reform plan for local autonomy of the civil administration group, which were passed as 26 articles according to the review opinions, including eight articles regarding the division and organization of autonomous regions, eleven articles regarding autonomous undertakings and powers, and two articles regarding autonomous talents. The closing ceremony was held at 2 p.m., with over 100 members and central representatives Dai Chuanxian, Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Yipeng of the Military Council, Luo Jialun of National Central University, Zhang Zhijiang of the National Martial Arts Hall, and over 30 others in attendance. Chairman Huang Shaoxiong delivered the closing speech, followed by instructions from central representatives and speeches from various guests. Finally, member Xiong Shihui gave a reply speech, followed by a photograph and adjournment. The conference lasted for six days from the 10th to the 15th, with seven general meetings held, passing over 400 proposals and reviewing over 200 recommendations. All members concentrated their efforts and discussed in detail, so the results of the conference were very satisfactory.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong delivered the closing speech at the Internal Affairs Conference on the 15th, stating that "This conference opened in Beijing at the same time as the League of Nations meeting to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue, which is the most powerful refutation to the enemy's propaganda in the League of Nations that we are an ununified and unorganized country. Therefore, this internal affairs conference not only has a significant impact on international public opinion, but also increases the courage of our soldiers who are dealing with enemy representatives in Geneva. This conference can open and close on schedule, and has a consultative attitude towards proposals, without emotional disputes, based on facts, without empty talk, and with a serious and responsible spirit, which is admirable. Also, this conference received over 400 proposals, reports, and recommendations, all of which have been reviewed and submitted to the general meeting for discussion, most of which are practical solutions to the phenomena of internal affairs in our country. If they can be implemented one by one, then internal affairs will usher in a new era. In the past, laws and regulations were too uniform across the country, which often caused estrangement and misunderstandings between the provinces and the central government. The resolutions of this conference can take into account the special circumstances of the central government and various provinces. It is believed that in the future, the central and local administrations can be as easy as using one's arms and fingers, and the connection will be smooth. It is hoped that all of you will work hard to implement the various cases in order to achieve them." Then, central representative Dai Chuanxian gave instructions, stating that "Listening to the chairman's report, the internal affairs conference has achieved satisfactory results in the shortest possible time. At this time of internal and external troubles in the country, this conference can obtain good strategies to solve the crisis of our country's demise. To summarize Sun Yat-sen's teachings, it is nothing more than restoring our country's inherent culture and catching up with modern science and civilization. Its administrative procedures are also nothing more than three major steps: increasing population, increasing production, and stabilizing society. Now that internal affairs can be explored according to the situation of various places, based on our country's inherent culture and with the spirit of science, it will surely gather great strength to implement the construction of a new China in various places." Next, administrative representative Chu Minyi gave instructions, saying that "To revive the nation and build the country, it is necessary to improve internal affairs, not only to focus on the central government, but to start from the local level, especially to implement the consolidation of county administration. Judging from the various cases on county administration passed by this conference, it can be seen that you have a basic understanding of local administration. It is hoped that you will work hard to implement them and lead the country to a bright path." Afterwards, guests such as Wang Lingxi, representative of the Judicial Yuan, Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Communications, and Luo Jialun, President of National Central University, gave speeches, the length of which is omitted. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Internal Affairs Conference issued a declaration, outlining important parts of the resolutions: (1) In order to lay the foundation for local security and national defense, the defense corps of various provinces will gradually adopt a conscription system from the militia, with equal emphasis on centralized training during the active duty period and universal training during the reserve period. (2) In order to create a new political foundation, county administration construction experimental zones will be established in various provinces, and county administration construction research institutes will be established so that the politics and local undertakings of each province can form a cellular development situation through the improvement of several counties, and be reproduced in the entire province in order. (3) In order to reform the political system, economize on institutions, and concentrate will and power to meet the needs of the times. (4) In order to promote the actual undertakings of local autonomy, so that local autonomous institutions can shoulder the important responsibility of developing local undertakings. (5) In order to organize land, regulate food, and guarantee tenant farmers, so that the largest and most numerous population of farmers in our country can obtain a suitable life. (6) In order to establish a local health system, health institutions will be established in each county as a center for treatment and prevention. (7) In order to improve etiquette and customs, eliminate the bad habits of extravagance and hypocrisy, and promote the spirit of frugality and honesty to renew the national spirit. (8) In order to promote investigation and statistical work so that all administrative plans and the development of undertakings have a basis. Furthermore, whether this conference can have genuine value lies in whether the proposals are actually implemented and whether the responsible persons have a genuine determination to govern. Once the determination is established, all forces will arise from this and the results will be seen from this. If domestic politics is enlightened and the country is stable, then external aggression is not to be feared and the communist bandits are not to be feared. Otherwise, even without external aggression or the Communist Party, it is difficult to avoid the calamity of extinction. (Special dispatch on the 15th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Understanding Russia After Sino-Soviet Resumption of Relations</h3>
<p>Time flies, fifteen months have passed swiftly from the September 18th Incident to today. Within these fifteen months, in terms of military affairs, the people have cried out for the recovery of lost territories, while those in power are indulging in internal strife. In terms of diplomacy, those who clamor in Geneva and rush about in European and American metropolises are merely trying to use treaties to restrain aggression and fight power with justice. It has long been recognized by discerning individuals that this is a vain and illusory dream that ultimately leads to futile efforts. Now, with the situation becoming increasingly dire, plans have been drastically changed, leading to the resumption of Sino-Soviet relations. Although future developments cannot yet be predicted, the opening of new paths in diplomacy and the search for alternative solutions are already evident.</p>
<p>In the present era, all international changes are driven by economic interests. To believe that personal feelings can sway diplomatic situations is either self-deception or succumbing to manipulation. In the past, many European countries attempted to alter international situations through marriage alliances, but these efforts have been forgotten. Therefore, if diplomatic officials still speak of "so-and-so is a friend of mine," "so-and-so is my mentor," "I can move so-and-so with sincerity," or "I can enlighten so-and-so with reason," their failure is inevitable. In short, when discussing diplomacy today, the only key lies in clearly understanding the economic environments of all parties.</p>
<p>The reason we believe that the League of Nations cannot help our country is not because any member nation is unfriendly to us, nor because anyone in the League has a grudge against us, nor because any nation or individual in the League is willing to destroy public law and treaties or disregard public justice and righteousness. The reason the League of Nations cannot greatly help our country is that it is an organization for planning international peace, and in the current era, under the meaning of international peace within imperialism, China becomes an inevitable sacrifice. The development of capitalism has reached its zenith, and a fatal economic panic has intensified conflicts among the great powers. The only way to alleviate these conflicts and maintain peace is to increase exploitation of colonies and semi-colonies. If the gains from increased exploitation can be fairly distributed, capitalism can survive a little longer, and war can be temporarily avoided. The meaning of international peace is simply this: tigers compete, and there will be casualties; they unite to capture sheep, and their bellies are full, and conflict ceases. Objectively, all international peace movements aim at fairly dividing colonies and semi-colonies, and there is no other effective means of maintaining world peace. If the intelligentsia still wants to sell the League of Nations to preserve the sanctity of treaties, empathize with human feelings, and admonish Japan with reason, as if current diplomacy could still emulate Bao Xu's weeping at the Qin court to achieve the effect of moving people with sincerity, would it not be playing the lute to a cow or seeking skin from a tiger? Truly, they know not what is possible.</p>
<p>What is past cannot be mended, but what is to come can still be pursued. What do we expect from Russia in the future? Wang Yin-chuan once used Russia's focus on defense to prove that Russia is not imperialistic. We believe that using military preparations to prove whether a country is imperialistic is not thorough enough, because military facilities cannot escape the needs of economic relations. The reason why the development of capitalism must lead to imperialism is precisely because its economic system has inevitable cause-and-effect relationships. Capitalist production, from the perspective of individual producers, must seek to have the income from their products exceed the expenditure on production costs. The difference between income and expenditure is the capitalist's profit. Therefore, from the perspective of all producers nationwide, the total amount of production must exceed the total amount of national consumption. This excess production must seek markets overseas so that the capitalist's profit can be converted into money for accumulation, and the nation's wealth can be increased. This overseas market must be a country with immature production and more imports than exports; otherwise, if we exchange products for products, offsetting each other, money will not flow inward. This is why the great powers must operate colonies and semi-colonies. With the operation of colonies and semi-colonies, in order to resist competition, and suppress reaction, they cannot but expand their military preparations, and imperialism dedicated to aggression is thus formed.</p>
<p>Russia is a socialist country. Its production capital is exclusively owned by the state, and its production purpose is to supply the consumption of the people nationwide. If the consumption of a certain product is insufficient, it exports other products with a surplus to exchange for it. If there is still a surplus, it either reduces production or stores it for future needs. It is like a large family whose fields and houses are inherited from ancestors, with fathers and sons, brothers working together to cultivate the land, and sisters-in-law, sisters working together to weave. The gains from cultivation and weaving are consumed jointly. If consumption is insufficient, they collectively economize; if there is a surplus, they store it for future needs. The so-called panic of overproduction does not exist for us. If work is heavy, they work day and night; if work is light, they rest together. The so-called panic of unemployment does not exist for us either. Because of this, Russia's foreign trade relations do not go beyond the form of barter trade, each offering what they have in surplus and taking what they need, trading and then leaving, each getting what they want. And it is almost unnecessary for Russia to contend for colonies with military force; hence its focus on defense.</p>
<p>Only because of this economic relationship will the Japanese compete for hegemony over the Yangtze River, while Russia will stand idly by. Even if they compete for economic hegemony over the Northeast, Russia may not resort to arms. However, if they compete for the Northeast and want to establish a pro-Japanese puppet state in Manchuria, it will be a threat right under Russia's nose. For its own security, Russia cannot but pay great attention to it. This is the point where Russia and our country share common interests, and it is what we can hope for in the changes in the international situation after the resumption of Sino-Soviet relations.</p>

<p>League of Nations Committee of Nineteen</p>
<h3>Resolution Draft Passed</h3>
<p>Empty Content Just to Deal with the Situation</p>
<p>Great Powers’ Pro-Japanese Attitude Unchanged</p>
<p>U.S. and Russia’s Participation Uncertain</p>
<p>Our Country Only Has Two Paths to Follow</p>
<p>Firmly Unyielding or Offered as a Sacrifice</p>
<h3>Mexico, Angered by Great Powers’ Oppression of Small Countries, Notifies Withdrawal from League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen passed the draft resolution of the Drafting Committee today. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The five-member Drafting Committee continued to meet for three days. Due to differences of opinion between large and small countries, heated debates arose repeatedly. Only before the meeting of the Committee of Nineteen this afternoon did the Drafting Committee agree on a draft resolution, which reportedly includes the following points: 1. The basis of the principle of mediation; 2. The procedure for inviting the U.S. and Russia; 3. The issue of accepting the Lytton Report. This draft will be passed by the Committee of Nineteen and submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly for discussion after being sent to both China and Japan. However, because Russia seems to be refusing to participate and the U.S.'s participation is uncertain, the future is extremely difficult. Although the League of Nations wants to use its power to implement reconciliation, the great powers’ pro-Japanese attitude has not changed. China only has two paths to take: one is to firmly unyielding, and the other is to be offered as a sacrifice. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Drafting Committee established by the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen held meetings twice today, in the morning and afternoon, to discuss the resolution issue. At the meeting, British Foreign Secretary Simon continued to pressure the representatives of the Czech Republic and Spain to maintain justice and strongly advocated yielding to Japan. Therefore, the resolution was shortened to two pages, with content that merely dealt with the situation and thanked the Lytton mission for their efforts. It advocated that the Committee of Nineteen be changed into a Mediation Committee. Because Japan opposed the proposal to invite the U.S. and Russia, Simon, having received a request from Japan, also advocated deleting this item. As for whether the invitation to the U.S. and Russia can be successful, it will only be decided at the meeting at 3:30 PM on the 15th. It is expected that the meeting will be concluded by 5 PM on the 15th. The British Foreign Secretary Simon, who is acting as an accomplice to Japan, returned to England at 10:45 PM today. It is generally speculated that Simon has succeeded in pressuring the small countries. (China United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The representatives of England, France, the Czech Republic, Spain, and Switzerland, the five-member Drafting Committee, finalized the proposal and report draft today, which will be considered by the Committee of Nineteen at its meeting at 5 PM this afternoon and then sent to the representatives of China and Japan. When the Drafting Committee was discussing, the Japanese representative Sato sat in an adjacent room, and the Drafting Committee members frequently went back and forth. The Drafting Committee is currently keeping the contents of the draft strictly secret, but it is heard that the wording is very mild. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Drafting Committee elected by the Committee of Nineteen seemed to have encountered difficulties yesterday, and the draft resolution it prepared was therefore delayed until noon today to be finalized. Even if the Committee of Nineteen can make a decision today, the representatives of China and Japan must first consult their respective governments before convening an extraordinary assembly. Therefore, it is generally believed that the extraordinary assembly may not be able to hold a meeting at the beginning of next week. As for the content of the draft resolution, it is merely a reiteration of the resolution of the General Assembly on March 11th of this year. The issue of inviting the U.S. and Russia to participate will be decided by the extraordinary assembly. Although British Foreign Secretary Simon is an important figure in the drafting of the resolution, he is not presiding over it. Simon has already left Geneva last night, and the British representative Kagan is acting on his behalf. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Geneva dispatch, the resolution drafted by the Drafting Committee on the 13th is only two pages long, and the content seems simple and indifferent. The result of British Foreign Secretary Simon's efforts to suppress the representatives of small countries and exclude resolutions unfavorable to Japan is clearly visible. The main points are as follows: 1. Reaffirmation of the General Assembly's resolution on March 11th; 2. Supporting the Lytton Report's agreement on the Sino-Japanese issue and providing the best information; 3. Raising the issue of a Mediation Committee, but not mentioning the invitation to the U.S. and Russia. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>U.S. and Russia Participation Issue</h3>
<p>League of Nations Telegraphs Washington to Solicit Opinions</p>
<p>Russia Expresses Unwillingness to Participate in Mediation</p>
<p>(Geneva) From the perspective of observation, Russia seems unwilling to participate in the Committee of Nineteen. As for the U.S., it must first know the basic conditions for mediating the Sino-Japanese issue before agreeing to participate. Last night, the League of Nations telegraphed Washington to solicit opinions. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Mexico Notifies Withdrawal from League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat received a letter from the Mexican government this morning, stating that due to financial difficulties, the country fears that it will be unable to pay membership fees in the near future, so it has no choice but to withdraw from the League of Nations after giving two years' notice, as required by the covenant. (National News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At 3 PM this afternoon, the Mexican representative to Geneva visited Drummond, stating that Mexico will withdraw from the League of Nations. Although Mexico uses the inability to afford League of Nations fees as the reason, the truth is not that simple. It is said that Mexico has seen through the League of Nations as merely a tool for England and France to oppress small countries and is completely manipulated by the European Union. Joining is no longer beneficial and is detrimental in spirit, so it cannot but withdraw frankly. If the League of Nations cannot uphold justice in the Sino-Japanese dispute in the future, it is feared that Mexico will not be the only country to withdraw from the League of Nations. (China United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Side Explains Misunderstanding to Us</h3>
<p>Simon's Remarks Did Not Show Partiality?</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the British representative Simon made pro-Japanese remarks at the League of Nations General Assembly, which were unanimously criticized by our country's public opinion, the British side has somewhat awakened. It is reliably learned that the British government has indirectly and directly expressed to our government authorities that Simon's remarks at the League of Nations General Assembly were intended to promote reconciliation and did not show partiality to any party. England is a loyal member of the League of Nations and will not lag behind in maintaining the dignity of the covenant. It hopes that China will not misunderstand this. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>True Face of British Imperialism</h3>
<p>Anglo-Persian Oil Case</p>
<p>Rushed to Invoke Article 15 of the Covenant</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation to the League of Nations feels that England is strict with itself and lenient with others, because England is eager to invoke Article 15 of the covenant in the dispute over the Anglo-Persian oil concession, while China has more than enough reason to invoke this article, but England has suggested to China that it endure Japanese aggression. The general opinion is that England and Persia only have a dispute over economic issues, and now they are eagerly proposing Article 15 of the covenant as a response. This move, in spirit, can consolidate the position of the Chinese delegation at the extraordinary assembly. (Havas dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Simon Hastens Back to London</h3>
<p>Japanese Representatives Lobby Late at Night</p>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon returned from Geneva and arrived in London by plane at 11:20 this morning. (National News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representative Matsuoka and Ambassador Matsudaira to England visited British Foreign Secretary Simon, who was about to return home, at his hotel at 9:40 PM on the 14th, explaining that Japan will absolutely not change its League of Nations countermeasures for any changes in the meeting, and exchanged opinions on the Drafting Committee of the resolution before departing at 10:50 PM. After the meeting, Matsuoka told Japanese reporters that he made a special trip to pay his respects because Sir Simon was about to return home, and at the same time exchanged opinions on two or three points. (Dentsu dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Geneva dispatch: Japanese representative Matsudaira met with British Foreign Secretary Simon twice on the 14th, in the morning and afternoon, to explain Japan's position. Matsudaira had always been in contact with Simon, so after Simon returned home, Matsudaira also returned to England from Geneva to take up his post. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Party Department Consoles Three Representatives</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Shandong Provincial Party Department telegraphed representatives Yan, Gu, and Guo in Geneva on the 13th, stating that at this League of Nations meeting, the officials, entrusted by the people and shouldering the mission of the nation, attended the meeting, negotiated, exposed the conspiracy of the violent Japan, and strongly refuted Matsuoka's sophistry. They were righteous and eloquent, arousing sympathy from friendly nations and jointly condemning the Japanese atrocities. Although the final victory is still unknown, the officials' hard work is truly commendable. Separated by the ocean, we cannot help but express our admiration and telegraph our condolences, hoping that they will continue their efforts. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Dr. Nitobe Inazo Strives to Promote Propaganda to the U.S.</h3>
<p>Dr. Nitobe Inazo, who is currently touring the United States to lobby, gave a speech at this World Affairs Research Association today, defending Japan's actions in China and Manchuria, saying that Japan's life and reputation are now in a critical state due to the Manchurian problem. Japan's actions in China and Manchuria are justified. The League of Nations lacks mediation in the background of the Far East issue, so its deliberations cannot be fair. (Domei dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Senator Borah Agrees to Recognize Russia</h3>
<p>U.S.'s Economic Decline Promotes Trend of Early Recognition</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Dispute May Also Achieve Practical Resolution</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Senator Borah inquired in the Senate today about the opinions on quickly proceeding with the recognition of Russia. Although several people are now known to be in favor of recognition, the general opinion is still not clearly understood. According to Borah's statement to reporters today, unless some Senate leaders change their minds, discussing this case rashly will be futile. Borah also said that the current economic decline in the United States and the impact of recognition on the Far East dispute will be two major factors in considering the recognition issue. Congress must now seek to promote the market for American goods, and Russia can at least provide the sale of certain goods. He also believes that after the United States recognizes Russia, there will be a trend toward settling the Far East dispute, because if the United States can directly discuss the Manchurian problem with Russia, he believes that there is a greater possibility of reaching a practical solution. Furthermore, the impact of this move on the disarmament issue should not be ignored. He strongly agrees with the Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov's statement that only after all countries agree can disarmament be possible. (National News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Chinese and Russian Foreign Ministers Exchange Congratulatory Telegrams on Resumption of Relations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, the foreign ministers of the two countries exchanged congratulatory telegrams. The telegrams are as follows:</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Luo Zhiyi's Telegram to Litvinov</h3>
<p>On the occasion of the restoration of normal relations between the two countries, I would like to express my sincere congratulations to Your Excellency. I am confident that this fact will open a new era of mutual understanding and friendship in the history of both countries.</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Reply to Luo</h3>
<p>The restoration of friendly relations between the two countries will be of great benefit to the people of China and Russia and to world peace. I dare to offer my trust and congratulations. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Previously Signed Sino-Russian Treaties Remain in Effect</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign affairs authorities say that previous Sino-Russian treaties will become effective again with the resumption of relations. The candidate for ambassador to Russia will be appointed after the Second Plenary Session. As for the signing of a non-aggression treaty and a trade treaty between China and Russia, it will take a considerable period of time. It is found that the Sino-Russian Agreement signed by Foreign Minister Gu Weijun of the Beijing government and Karakhan, the ambassador to Beijing, on May 31, 1924, and the 1. Songhua River Navigation Treaty, negotiated by Wang Zhengting and Karakhan in the same year, based on the principle of reciprocity, Russian ships can sail; 2. Commercial tariffs are based on the principle of equality; 3. The Sino-Russian border is reorganized and demarcated; 4. Russia shall not promote communism within China, shall continue to be in effect. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person in the diplomatic circle said that the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, under the current international situation, is indeed of great help to peace in the Far East. In the near future, it is expected that the United States will also resume diplomatic relations with Russia. By then, the international situation will inevitably change. At this time of complex international relations, we really have the possibility of finding a way out, but the prerequisite is still that we can make the best efforts ourselves, because the restoration of relations between the two countries can only help each other commercially in international diplomacy. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Internally Designated as First Ambassador to Russia</h3>
<p>Russian Side May Agree and Order Will Be Issued Immediately</p>
<p>Still Negotiating Treaties with Russia in Geneva</p>
<p>Will Take Office in Russia After League of Nations Closes</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government carefully considered the ambassador to Russia and decided to appoint Yan Huiqing, who is experienced, stable, and highly regarded in the diplomatic world. This resumption of relations was negotiated by Yan and Litvinov, and their relationship is already harmonious. Appointing him as ambassador will facilitate the negotiation of treaties and the resolution of outstanding issues in the future. The Russian side will definitely agree to Yan, and a reply will be received soon, and the order will be issued immediately. Yan will go to Russia after the League of Nations is over, but he is still negotiating treaties with Li in Geneva. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Mo Dehui, our representative to the Sino-Russian Conference, is currently traveling back and forth between Berlin and Rome to recuperate, and has repeatedly telegraphed the government to report on his movements. As for Wang Zensi, he is still staying in Moscow. Before the new ambassador takes office, Wang is the de facto chargé d'affaires and will not return to China temporarily. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Business Community Prepares to Purchase Russian Goods</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The business community is very much in favor of the resumption of Sino-Russian relations. They are currently gathering to discuss purchasing Russian goods to replace enemy goods as soon as the Russian consul arrives in Tianjin. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Russian Commercial Director in China Begins to Arrange Embassy</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Russian Commercial Director in China, Zalaman, has been ordered to begin arranging the embassy in China. Starting today, he is cleaning the old Russian embassy buildings in Dongjiaomin Lane. It is expected that the office will be formally opened in early next month. There are more than 100 Russian residents in Beiping and 800 in Tianjin, most of whom are engaged in the cloth industry. Since the September 18th Incident, Russian-labeled foreign cloth has sold well in provinces, counties, villages, and towns in North China. Secondly, tea and sugar are also selling well. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign sources, after the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, Zha, the caretaker of the Russian consulate in Ping, has obtained the key from the minister and received all the documents at the consulate. The old Russian consulates will also continue to send people to take over. Our country is also preparing to restore normalcy in its consulates in Russia and will first send consuls to various places to preside over all diplomatic affairs. It is expected that a batch of them will be announced within a few days. As for the four consulates that have not been withdrawn by our country in Russia: Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Chita, and Heihe, they will be instructed by the Ministry to step up their work and forward all diplomatic documents on their behalf. The names of the Russian consulates in our Northeast, such as Harbin, will still use the name of the Consulate of the Republic of China in Harbin, etc. As for this resumption of relations, there are no other conditions between China and Russia, but the two agreements on China-Russia and the China Eastern Railway continue to be valid. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Wu Chaoshu and Wang Zhengting Talk About Sino-Russian Resumption of Relations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaoshu said that the resumption of Sino-Russian relations is a new development in our country's diplomacy, shifting international attention and opening up a stagnant situation. Generally speaking, it is a beneficial and necessary thing to do. What the international impact will be, cannot be predicted at this time. It must be known that the lost territory in the Northeast cannot be driven out of the Japanese army with the resumption of Sino-Russian relations alone. Observing the general consciousness of the people, such as the re-election of the U.S. president and the resumption of Sino-Russian relations, the joy is as if diplomatic success can be carefree, is it not a big mistake? (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting said that the resumption of Sino-Russian relations is an essential step in dealing with current diplomacy. This matter has been brewing for a long time before it was finally completed. China and Russia are naturally pleased, while ambitious countries may be afraid. As for whether England and France's attitude towards us will change, conventionally speaking, the resumption of relations between Country A and Country B in the international community is not enough to attract the attention of other countries or change attitudes. In my opinion, England and France both occupy important positions in our country's commerce, and I think they will not voluntarily give up their inherent goodwill and help the wicked. But based on past and recent events, in terms of morality and justice, England and France have not been righteous speakers, which is regrettable. As for the U.S. and Russia's expression of unwillingness to participate in the Committee of Nineteen, it is because they see that the League of Nations has repeatedly evaded responsibility in handling the Sino-Japanese issue, so it cannot attract non-member countries to join hands willingly. Those who are not careful in their comments may say that the League of Nations intends to shift responsibility to the U.S. and Russia, which is excessive, but it is not unworthy of consideration. However, for its own sake, the League of Nations should not show weakness because of the U.S. and Russia's non-participation. Wang did not say that our country has lost several provinces, and the aggressor has not shown the slightest sign of remorse. If we still rely on the League of Nations without preparing for practical strength and national unity, I am afraid that the Northeast territory will never be ours. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Mocks Japan</h3>
<p>Resumption of Relations Only to Consolidate Peace</p>
<p>Japanese Statements are Contradictory</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government newspaper "Izvestia" commented in an editorial today on the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson's remarks on the Sino-Russian resumption of relations, saying that the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson described the terror and threat of the Sino-Russian resumption of relations to Japan as being expressed to the fullest. These remarks lack the cultivation and composure of Japanese diplomats. There is nothing special about the resumption of normal relations between China and Russia. This move is only to consolidate peace and create a stable situation. Furthermore, the Japanese spokesperson's remarks are contradictory. China and the Soviet Union maintaining normal relations is a "big mistake," while Japan and the Soviet Union maintaining normal relations is completely legitimate, the distinction between which is quite puzzling. The Soviet Union has always adhered to a peaceful policy and is willing to maintain normal relations with all countries. The Sino-Russian resumption of relations is a clear manifestation of the peaceful policy and has no other peculiarities. It is clear that the "terror" and "threat" theories of some Japanese newspapers have seen their impact on the psychology of Japanese government officials. Finally, the newspaper expressed surprise at the Japanese statement that the Sino-Russian resumption of relations reduces the possibility of concluding a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty, saying that "Does this statement indicate that Japan will create new reasons to insist on rejecting the non-aggression treaty proposed by the Soviet Union? If so, then this statement is even more contradictory. The Soviet Union is still willing to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan and Manchuria. If Japan is indeed harboring the views on the Sino-Russian resumption of relations made by its Foreign Ministry spokesperson, then it can directly conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union and eliminate all unfounded suspicions."

<h3>Japanese Troops Colluding with Mongol Bandits to Plan for Jehol</h3>
<p>Meng Zhaotian Discusses the Situation in Rehe</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese troops are colluding with Mongol bandit representatives to plan for Jehol. Representatives from various Mongol banners met with Japanese military liaison officer Shinichi Ohashi at Mulitu Station on the 13th and have returned to their respective banners. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the three counties of Kailu, Chaoyang, and Jingpeng along the Rehe border, Mongol bandits bought off by the Japanese have recently been discovered causing disturbances. Several have been arrested and confessed to a conspiracy to disrupt Jehol. Mongol bandits outside Jehol are all gathering along the Tongliao-Qianjiatun road, where they are supplied with weapons and provisions by the Japanese, who plan to start attacking Jehol next spring. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Meng Zhaotian said that he was previously ordered by Tang Yulin to inspect the counties of Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Kailu, and Jianping along the Rehe border and convey Tang's greetings to the local militias. All areas are peaceful, but the people are highly motivated and willing to unite to resist Japan. After returning to Beiping, he reported the inspection results to Zhang. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Regulations on Repaying Accumulated Debts by the Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo" government, due to the Manchurian Incident and the demise of the Northeastern regime, faced demands for payment of unpaid debts and other similar arrears. To resolve this, a Committee for Post-Incident Debt Settlement was established. A solution has been reached, announced by Chairman Sakatani as follows: 1. For goods delivered after 1930 for which payment has not yet been made, totaling over 7,110,000 yuan, 35% will be repaid in the "first year of Datong," approximately 2,500,000 yuan, and 25% in the "second year of Datong," approximately 1,500,000 yuan, both in cash. The remaining amount will be paid with two-year bonds of the same face value, bearing 2% interest. 2. For debts incurred before 1929 and for undelivered goods, totaling approximately 1,200,000 yuan, a reasonable decision will be made after investigation. It is provisionally planned to issue bonds with the same terms as above, equivalent to the amount of the debt or the damages. All creditors, both domestic and foreign, will be treated equally.

<p>Summary of the Restructuring of Party Affairs by Headquarters</p>
<h3>Hubei Provincial Party Department Requests Instructions</h3>
<p>Recognizing the Difficulties in Implementing the Summary</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Provincial Party Department presented a report to the Third Plenary Session and the Central Committee on the 15th, requesting instructions on the summary of the restructuring of party affairs issued by the Headquarters. It stated, "Since the Headquarters announced the summary, party members have been confused, the people are concerned, and reactionary elements are spreading rumors that our party is incapable of leadership and is about to be abolished, resulting in a sharp decline in public trust in the party. The committee dares not comply with the letter from the Headquarters, and yet cannot afford to not comply. After consideration, it was decided to request instructions. The power to amend the general regulations belongs to the National Congress. The summary seems to differ in many ways from the general regulations. In terms of powers, the county party department can audit the policy direction of the same-level government, but the summary contains no such provision. In terms of discipline, if a party member has not violated party discipline, then a legally formed party department cannot dissolve it. In terms of the system, all working comrades in party departments at all levels are appointed by higher levels. If recommendations are submitted to the Headquarters for approval, it does not seem to be the appropriate procedure. In terms of mission, if party members delve into the masses, then according to the summary, the party will be isolated from the masses. The committee believes all of this is difficult to implement. We believe that Chiang embraces party rule, surpassing ordinary people, and that his demands are strict. We are afraid he is correcting wrongs to an extreme. These are temporary changes within the party, but outside the party, they aim to fundamentally destroy. We ask for a detailed review." The Hankou Municipal Party Department will also submit a similar petition requesting instructions. (15th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>War Debt Disputes Emerge One After Another</h3>
<p>Britain and Italy Pay as Planned, France and Belgium Stop Payment</p>
<p>Eastern European Countries Also Have Problems</p>
<p>War Debt Reorganization Negotiations to Begin Next Spring</p>
<p>The National News Agency telegraphed from Washington on the 14th, stating that the State Department announced today that the US government will adopt a wait-and-see policy regarding France and Belgium's failure to pay war debts on time. Both countries have notified the State Department that they will not be able to repay as scheduled. Britain's decision to pay the war debt as scheduled tomorrow has created a good impression in the United States. Negotiations to study Britain's entire war debt structure are expected to begin in early spring next year.</p>
<p>▲Reuters telegraphed from London on the 14th that today's newspapers carried news that British cabinet members will travel to Washington at the beginning of the new year to discuss the revision of debts between Britain and the United States. Political circles hope that the new and old presidents of the United States, Roosevelt and Hoover, can cooperate with each other in this conversation.</p>
<p>▲The National News Agency telegraphed from Washington on the 14th that after the British and Italian war debts due tomorrow have been paid, it is expected that the war debt issue will not be mentioned again in this session of Congress. Any motion to adjust war debt repayment will be handled by the next session of Congress. According to the current situation, the next session of Congress will convene around March or April, at which time nearly one-third of the House of Representatives members will be replaced with new figures, and most of them will be Democrats, who are expected to follow the lead of the new President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>▲Reuters telegraphed from Washington on the 14th that Republican Senator Keener today introduced a bill in the House of Representatives to prohibit the inflow of bonds of foreign governments that do not repay their debts into the United States and to prohibit the advertisement and transportation of such bonds.</p>
<h3>US Attitude Towards France</h3>
<p>Reuters telegraphed from Washington on the 14th that the US government's attitude towards European countries regarding debt repayment or overdue issues remains unchanged, despite France's strong advocacy for convening a meeting. However, there is an undercurrent of unease in political circles. News from France indicates that unless the United States agrees to reconsider, the French Chamber of Deputies will resolutely oppose payment. Democratic Senator McClellan expressed indignation today at France's behavior, saying that he believes this is the most indecent thing done by any country in the world, indicating that European countries treat treaty obligations as waste paper, and not just Germany. Chairman McKinley of the House Foreign Affairs Committee said that France's reasons for not paying war debts are not as good as any other country, because what it should pay is only 75% of what it received after the war. As for France's ability to pay the debt, it is not a problem. The White House and the State Department are still silent on this issue.</p>
<h3>British and Italian Payment Methods</h3>
<p>Havas telegraphed from New York on the 14th that general opinion on Wall Street here seems to believe that France's attitude has little impact on finance. The New York Federal Reserve Bank has confirmed the method adopted by Britain to repay the US debt of US$95,550,000, which is that the New York Reserve Bank will allocate cash for the British government's disposal, and then the Bank of England will record the amount in the US account for future remittance.</p>
<p>▲Reuters telegraphed from Rome on the 14th that it was announced in Rome today that Italy is prepared to repay the US debt of 1,245,000 yuan due tomorrow, and has now officially made good preparations for repayment.</p>

<p>Havas telegraphed from Washington on the 14th that the French Ambassador to the United States, Claudel, delivered a note to Secretary of State Stimson at 6:00 PM today, stating that the French government now has no authority to consult with the United States on war debt issues.</p>
<h3>Problems Also Arise in Eastern Europe</h3>
<p>Havas telegraphed from the Romanian capital on the 14th that the Foreign Minister recently ordered the Romanian Minister to the United Kingdom to contact British Prime Minister MacDonald regarding the Eastern European reparations issue. The grace period for this payment will expire tomorrow. The Lausanne Conference previously decided to have a special meeting to resolve this matter, but this meeting was never convened. The purpose of this contact is to seek an extension of the grace period.</p>
<p>▲Havas telegraphed from Warsaw on the 14th that the United States had stipulated that Poland's debt of 27 million Polish currency should be repaid in a certain form. Poland has recently decided not to repay in the scheduled form, but to show its sincerity, it will find a compromise repayment plan, or pay a portion first, or request repayment with promissory notes.</p>
<p>▲Havas telegraphed from Warsaw on the 14th that the Estonian government had previously requested the United States to allow it to postpone the payment of debt due on the 15th of this month. The United States did not reply. According to a report by the Polish Batalion News Agency, the Estonian government has decided not to pay.</p>
<h3>The French Government Formation Stalled</h3>
<p>The President Spends the Day Soliciting Opinions from Various Parties</p>
<p>Paris, 15th (National News Agency) - All eyes are currently focused on the meeting between the French President and Herriot this afternoon. At that time, the President will ask Herriot to form a new cabinet based on the majority opinion of the party leaders. However, it is generally speculated that Herriot may refuse to form a cabinet. Others suggest that the Radical Socialist Party should ask other leaders to form a new cabinet, still based on the previous cabinet's foundation in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>▲ Paris, 15th (National News Agency) - Although the Herriot cabinet has fallen, Herriot's prestige has greatly increased due to his heroic performance in the National Assembly yesterday. Almost the entire country believes that he is the only person capable of leading the country and safely navigating the difficult situation after the National Assembly rejected the debt repayment. If he strongly refuses to reorganize a new cabinet at this time, the cabinet crisis may be prolonged for several days or even a week or more.</p>
<p>▲ Paris, 14th (Reuters) - The French President has been very busy contacting important figures from various political parties today, but a successor has not yet been decided. After meeting with the President this afternoon, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Mars, told people, "The difficult political situation has just begun, and Herriot has not lost any of his authority." This statement almost implies inviting Herriot to cooperate in forming a new cabinet. There is now much talk of organizing a new government with the same colors as the Herriot cabinet, with the intention of having Paul-Boncour, Chautemps, Caillaux, or Steeg as Prime Minister. It is found that the above-mentioned people all belong to the Radical Party, similar to Herriot. It is expected that the President will first ask Herriot to reorganize the cabinet, but Herriot may temporarily decline until others have tried and then decide what to do.</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw Departs for China</h3>

<p>Why Did Puyi's Brother-in-Law Come to London?</p>
<h3>No Outsiders Allowed Near His Residence</h3>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - Puyi's brother-in-law, Mr. Zheng, and his wife have arrived here. According to Zheng's words to guests, they are here as students, and their main purpose is to learn English and investigate the situation of British society. As for how long they will stay in England, it cannot be predetermined and depends on the situation in China. Mr. and Mrs. Zheng are currently being hosted by Sir Johnston, Puyi's former English teacher.</p>
<p>▲ London, 15th (Reuters) - Mr. and Mrs. Zheng are currently residing at Johnston's residence. Johnston is protecting them thoroughly, not allowing outsiders to approach. Even friends who want to enter his house are turned away.</p>
<h3>Belgium Forms New Government</h3>
<p>Brussels, 14th (National News Agency) - Belgian Prime Minister de Broqueville resigned yesterday due to changes in the composition of the National Assembly, but today he was re-appointed by the King to form a new cabinet. De Broqueville has accepted the mandate. It is said that de Broqueville is now planning to form a national coalition cabinet. The previous cabinet only included figures from the Catholic Party and the Liberal Party. This time, the Socialist Party will be added. It is expected that the list of candidates for the new cabinet will be submitted to the King for approval on Friday.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Discusses Philippine Independence Bill</h3>
<p>It Is Too Early to Say It Will Be Passed</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (National News Agency) - Today, the U.S. Senate passed the Broussard Amendment to the Hare–Hawes–Cutting Act for Philippine independence. The content stipulates an eight-year transition period before independence is implemented. During this period, all Philippine goods will be subject to import duties, with the tax rate increasing annually. Initially, a 5% ad valorem tax will be levied, and in the final year, the highest tax rate can be increased to 85%. In the previous Congress, this amendment was considered too radical, and some senators believed that the eight-year preparation period was too short, so it failed to pass. Now, with the pro-independence forces greatly increased, it was quickly passed. After this amendment was passed, Senator Pittman immediately moved to adopt the Hare bill passed by the House of Representatives. Because the House bill is not much different from the amended Senate bill, it can save negotiation procedures by passing the House bill. Currently, this motion is still being voted on. However, regardless of whether the Senate adopts its own bill or the House's Hare bill, the independence of the Philippines can definitely be passed by both houses and transferred to the President within a few days. Because of the current situation in the Senate, it is expected that there will be an overwhelming majority in favor of independence.</p>
<p>▲ Washington, 14th (National News Agency) - Today, Washington was quite surprised to receive widespread news from abroad that the U.S. Congress has agreed to Philippine independence within eight years. Because Pittman's motion in the Senate has not yet been voted on. Although the Senate's adoption of the Broussard Amendment shows support for Philippine independence within a shorter period of time, the entire bill has not yet been decided. It cannot be hastily said that Congress has agreed to the Philippine independence bill within eight years.</p>
<h3>Switzerland Elects New President</h3>
<p>Bern, 15th (National News Agency) - The Swiss Federal Council and the two chambers of parliament held a joint meeting today and elected Federal Councillor Edmund Schulthess as the Swiss Federal President for 1933 and Philipp Etter as Vice President.</p>

<h3>The War of Words Between the Chinese and Japanese Representatives in the Investigative Committee</h3>
<p>In the afternoon, the Chinese representative, Dr. Wellington Koo, stated that he reserved the right to refute the Japanese representative's attacks on China. Regarding the Japanese representative's use of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to embellish his aggression as self-defense, he asked those present who had signed the pact to judge for themselves. Then, he detailed China's position on the Northeast problem, from the historical facts of Japan's invasion of China since ancient times to the completion of the Investigative Committee's report, for two hours. He asked the League of Nations to seek a fundamental solution based on the Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Lytton Report. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Before stating the views of the Chinese government, I would like to address what the Japanese representative said this morning. If we were to accept everything the Japanese representative said, then Japan would be a docile sheep being bitten by a ferocious China, trying its best to escape in order to survive. Fortunately, the Administrative Yuan has the Investigative Committee's report as evidence, because the content of the report is completely impartial and fair. The Japanese representative raised several points in his speech this morning, which are the same points that I am about to mention. However, there are other points, as well as the points in the "Opinion Book" that was just published last night, which I will criticize next time. The most shocking thing in the Japanese representative's speech was the criticism of the current situation of the Chinese government. On this point, I will explain the reasons why the Japanese government has been constantly attacking China. Even if we assume, for the sake of discussion, that what the Japanese government said is not completely inaccurate, we should still ask whether the Japanese government's military aggression and the military occupation of the richest three eastern provinces of China, which have a national border area equal to the territory of France and Germany, can be considered justified. The Japanese representative also claimed that the actions of the Japanese army in the three eastern provinces were only acts of self-defense, and cited the reservations specially put forward by the major signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact to justify them. However, the Japanese representative also claimed that the Japanese military had long planned in detail. With one call to action, the entire army rose up. Their actions were almost automatic. The Japanese representative expressed his satisfaction with the rapid and precise implementation of the plan. However, the Japanese representative forgot to point out that the Chinese side had absolutely no plans for aggression or self-defense. All of this has been confirmed by the Lytton Report. On the night of September 18th to the 19th, when the Japanese army used machine guns and artillery to implement its planned plan, the Chinese army automatically withdrew and did not make any resistance. Just from this point, can we still regard the actions of the Japanese army as acts of self-defense? If the actions of the Japanese army, as the Japanese representative said, can be regarded as acts of self-defense within the scope of the reservations of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, then why do we need to maintain this peace pact? However, I firmly believe that some of you in the Administrative Yuan who personally participated in the establishment of the pact will have a better explanation. I can only ask you to explain it yourself. I have made the above-mentioned remarks on the Japanese representative's speech, and now I would like to present the Chinese government's views on the Investigative Committee's report to the Administrative Yuan. The crystallization of the work of the Investigative Committee, that is, its report to the Administrative Yuan, should receive the greatest praise. The Chinese people express sincere respect to Lord Lytton and his colleagues, as well as the secretaries, experts, and other staff of the Investigative Committee for completing their important mission, and it is appropriate. I would like to take this opportunity to formally express the Chinese government's admiration. During the nine months of hard work, the Investigative Committee did not change its enthusiasm for the cause due to changes in the environment and climate. As the Chinese representative, I followed the gentlemen and was especially honored to witness their sincerity, perseverance, and sense of responsibility. The Investigative Committee was quite concerned about the unnecessary obstacles to the Chinese representative's accompanying them to the three eastern provinces. After the Chinese representative and his entourage arrived in the three eastern provinces, various unexpected restrictions emerged one after another. All actions were restricted, so that the Chinese representative could not provide assistance within the scope of his duties during the local investigation by the Investigative Committee, as stipulated in the resolution of the Administrative Yuan on December 10 last year. Several times, the Chinese representative had to ask the Investigative Committee to pay attention to the various difficulties and inconveniences he and his entourage were experiencing. These difficulties and inconveniences were sufficient to unnecessarily restrict his freedom of action and hinder the execution of his mission. I remember that the Chinese representative made a public letter to the Investigative Committee on April 27 this year in Shenyang, which said,</p>
<p>'Whenever any member of the Chinese representative went out, one or more Japanese policemen would follow behind. Inside the Yamato Hotel, there were also many Japanese policemen circulating and monitoring. When the Chinese representative moved from one room to another or entered the dining room for meals, someone followed behind. The room numbers of the rooms that the Chinese representative entered and exited were also registered. Part of the Chinese delegation resided in the Toyo Hotel, and the situation was even more difficult. There were about ten Japanese policemen monitoring at the bottom level. When members of the Chinese delegation went out, they had to notify the detectives in the hotel so that they could send someone to "protect" them. Even in private rooms in the hotel, there could never be a moment of peace. Japanese policemen could break into the room at any time to ask questions to members of the delegation. The Chinese delegation was completely isolated from foreign contacts. Chinese people were absolutely not allowed to go to the Yamato Hotel or the Toyo Hotel to visit the delegation, and all Chinese people who did so were arrested.'</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Before Su Bingwen's Retreat</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army's Attempt to Lure Su Failed, So They Launched a Large-Scale Attack</p>
<p>Zhalantun Was Attacked by Surprise, So the Soviet Army Began to Retreat</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: In the battle on the Haman Line, the Japanese army entered Lantun at noon on December 1. A column of armored vehicles advanced north from Zhalantun on the afternoon of the 1st, intending to attack the Xing'an Mountains and Boketu. Our National Salvation Army, led by Su Bingwen and Zhang Dianjiu, ordered the troops in front to retreat and defend the Xing'an Mountains, while also rushing to transfer troops from the rear to concentrate at Mandu River and Hailar. Both sides are actively preparing, hoping that the Japanese army will not attack the Xing'an Mountains within a week. Because after the fierce battle at Fularji, Yaokule, and Houkuler on November 10, the National Salvation Army heavily concentrated its forces, with Zhang Yuding's troops concentrated to defend Gefen Mountain, confronting the Japanese army in Yaokule and Houkuler. Wu Delin's army defended Zhujia Kan, and Mongolian cavalry guarded Nianzishan and Genghis Khan. The general headquarters was set up in Lantun, and Zhang Dianjiu borrowed Xie Ke to plan military affairs there. However, the National Salvation Army was weak, with less than 5,000 troops in total. Once dispersed, it became more inconvenient to communicate and respond. Su Bingwen's intention was that the Japanese side had sent Komatsubara, the chief of the Harbin Special Affairs Agency, as a negotiator, and invited him to meet at Manchuria, a border town on the Soviet-Russian border, to ask for the release of Japanese expatriates who were banned in Manchuria. He intended to use this point to play along, waiting for the end of the League of Nations conference before planning further development. He knew that his troops were not many and lacked weapons. Once a fire was started, the Japanese army would heavily concentrate its forces and increase them continuously, so it would be difficult for the National Salvation Army to deal with it for a long time. Therefore, although he was not very willing to attend the meeting that Komatsubara hoped for, he successively released 48 Japanese expatriate women and children from Manchuria to ease the military situation. Komatsubara arrived at the Russian border on November 13 and has been there for two weeks. During this time, a plane had flown into Russian territory once and was once expelled by the Soviet-Russian authorities, saying that Su Bingwen had no intention of negotiating, so the Japanese side's committee had no need to stay. The Japanese felt quite embarrassed by this, but they had to shamelessly stay in Russia for a few more days. On the one hand, their Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Mr. Isoya, reported to the country and held a special military conference, deciding to attack and aim at the Xing'an Mountains. Then, heavy troops would be sent to force Su Bingwen to submit and release the Japanese expatriates. This was the first step. After Su released the Japanese expatriates, they would send troops to attack Su, determined to eliminate Su's power. In order to avoid contact with Russia, the army targeted Cuogang between Manchuria. Another branch of Zhang HaiPeng's Mongolian army was transferred to bypass the Xing'an Mountains from the Suolun Mountain grassland to cut off the connection between Hailar and Nianzishan and Zhalantun. The troop deployment was as follows: The Hiraga Brigade was responsible for the front, advancing along the railway from Fularji. The Hattori Brigade of the 6th Korean Division, newly transferred from the east, was the main force, taking Gannannan (i.e., Ganjingzi) from Qiqihar, bypassing our army's three lines of defense on Gefen Mountain, Nianzishan, and Zhujia Kan, and attacking the rear of Zhalantun. Another cavalry unit was the reserve force, taking our Genghis Khan position. The Motegi Regiment took the Nianzishan position, and the Miyamoto Branch took the Gefen Mountain position. The total strength of the troops was more than 16,000, with advanced weapons such as armored vehicles and airplanes attached. On November 29, our army detected the increase of the Japanese army and once attacked Fularji with armored vehicles and destroyed the railway south of Zhujia Kan to block the Japanese army's advance. At the same time, all armies were also actively preparing for an all-out attack, intending to launch a counterattack. However, because the troops were too small, once they were transferred, the rear was in danger, so the counterattack was not carried out. After the Japanese army's plan reached Qiqihar, it began to operate under the command of the 14th Division Commander, Matsuki Naoaki. The Hattori Brigade, which departed from Qiqihar, requisitioned hundreds of large and small cars from Heiyuan, and transported them overnight on the 29th. By the morning of the 30th, it had advanced to the northeastern highlands of Zhalantun. Although Zhalantun was our army's general headquarters, there were not many troops there. After discovering the enemy army appearing in the rear, they had to issue a retreat order, retreating to the city of Zhalantun (i.e., Yalu County). A fierce battle broke out with the Japanese army outside the city. The Japanese army responded with air and land forces, attacking from above and below. Our army fought fiercely for two hours. At about 10 o'clock on this day, they retreated to the grassland. Our army in Nianzishan, Genghis Khan, and Gefen Mountain heard that the enemy army had appeared in the rear, so they had to abandon the forward positions and withdraw outside the railway. The Japanese army took the opportunity to occupy Nianzishan and Genghis Khan, and used several airplanes near Boketu to chase and bomb trains and destroy railways, cutting off our army's retreat route. Now, our armies are retreating along the Mongolian grassland, and their strength has not been greatly damaged. Su Bingwen heard the news and led thousands of troops to the Xing'an Mountains to defend that area to prevent the enemy army from advancing again. However, since the Japanese army has bypassed to the rear, it is afraid that it will be difficult to defend for a long time. Su had a letter to the elders of the Northeast a few days ago, which was found in Harbin, advising the people to help with money if they have money, and to destroy the enemy's rear if they have strength. The letter was sent by the post office and was seized by the Japanese side. It said that Manchuria could no longer send mail. The discovery of this printed matter was probably due to local people advertising for Su. Because a certain brigade commander (said to be Li Wenbing) who is now serving the puppet state is being monitored, the traitors of the puppet state are now in danger. (December 3)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Construction Department Takes Over the Industry Department</h3>

<h3>All Circles Eagerly Await the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce said: ...... Unite in Spirit to Face National Crisis</p>
<p>The National Goods Association said: ...... A National Tax Protection System Should be Established</p>
<p>The Propaganda Corps said: ...... Rise Up, Unite, and Resist by Force</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of this year officially opened in Beijing yesterday. During this time of national crisis, all domestic and foreign affairs should have important resolutions. Yesterday, various groups in Shanghai sent congratulatory messages or offered suggestions, as recorded below:</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Yesterday's telegram congratulating the Third Plenary Session read: "To the Third Plenary Session in Nanjing: The opening of the Third Plenary Session is heard far and wide, bringing joy to the people. From now on, unite in spirit and face the national crisis. Merchants and people deeply admire and look forward to it. We send this telegram to congratulate you and respectfully request your consideration. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows, Xian."</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Factory Federation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, they asked Fu Rulin and Xue Dubi, two members of the Central Committee, to jointly introduce a petition to the Third Plenary Session, stating: "For the past twenty-one years, we have been advocating national products, but foreign goods still flood the market. This is because empty words are useless, and we must seek practical solutions. The government should establish a tariff protection system. If we are bound by tariff agreements and cannot freely change them, then we should clearly define a dumping tax to limit them. Since the imposition of the 2.5% surtax in the fifteenth year, foreign merchants have avoided heavy taxes and set up factories in treaty ports. If we impose the same factory tax, Chinese merchants with weak capital will find it difficult to compete. We should establish a bonus or subsidy system to support them."</p>
<h3>Northeast Volunteer Army Propaganda Corps</h3>
<p>Yesterday's telegram to the Third Plenary Session read: "To the entire members of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang: Since annexing Ryukyu and Korea, the violent Japanese have been actively pursuing their policy of aggression against China for decades. Their forcible occupation of the Northeast on September 18 and their trampling of Shanghai on January 28 expose their ambitions more and more clearly. We, the brave men of the northern frontier, cannot bear to watch the fall of the Northeast and have risen up to resist with our lives. Our voices have spread far and wide, arousing anger everywhere. However, we are isolated in the remote borderlands, lacking both food and ammunition. If we are not supported for a long time, we will inevitably fill the ravines. If the Northeast is lost, North China will be in danger, and the Central Plains will also be at risk. Recently, China and Russia have restored diplomatic relations, which will surely bring a new turning point in international affairs. We should deeply understand this at this time and no longer rely solely on the League of Nations or engage in empty talk. We must resolutely unite and resist by force. On the one hand, we must quickly reorganize national defense and engage in military construction. On the other hand, we must immediately dispatch elite troops to assist the volunteer army in the Northeast. At the same time, we should train the masses and arm them to defend the rear. We know that if the orders are issued early, those who rush to righteousness will arrive in droves. Although the enemy's situation is very different from ours, the spirit of the people is enough to swallow mountains and rivers. As proven by all countries in ancient and modern times, survival depends on bloody battles, and resistance leads to death. Moreover, the people of the country share the same hatred of the enemy, and the hearts of the people are not completely dead. If the superiors can unite, the subordinates will strive to follow, contributing strength and wealth. If the whole country strikes together, how can we not be victorious? Otherwise, as time passes, people's hearts will gradually cool, and those with a sense of justice will take dangerous paths, leading to greater internal strife and making it more difficult to resist foreign aggression. At that time, even if we want to imitate the three households who destroyed Qin, I fear that Qin will have already destroyed us. Now, at the opening of the Third Plenary Session, all the talents are gathered, and there will be great plans. I offer a humble opinion and dare to ask for its adoption. The key to survival lies in this action. Time is running out. I respectfully submit this report and hope that you will consider it. Northeast Volunteer Army Propaganda Corps bows."</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Issues Declaration on the Restoration of Sino-Russian Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Soviet Russia's Mass Production</p>
<p>Will Forever Be Developed in the Far East</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration yesterday on the restoration of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations, stating: "Sino-Russian trade began in the early years of the Kangxi Emperor and has a history of more than two hundred years. Moreover, the two countries share a border, and hundreds of thousands of Chinese people reside in Russia in the northeastern and northwestern provinces. Russian land trade has extended its reach throughout the Tian Shan Mountains, both north and south, and Mongolia. The complexity of the relationship and the length of history are unparalleled globally. In recent years, although diplomatic relations have been stagnant, Soviet Russian commerce has continued to advance rapidly, from Harbin in the north to Shanghai in the south, demonstrating that human-made obstacles cannot overcome natural advantages. China and Soviet Russia, in general, are both industrially backward countries. However, Soviet Russia has recently achieved success with its Five-Year Plan, and its heavy industry has jumped to the forefront. Our country, mired in production decline and economic depression, is unfortunately facing aggression by a powerful enemy and the loss of its borders. We should learn from our neighbors and actively build so as to defend the border and resist foreign insults. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of this chamber, proposed the restoration of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations at the National Crisis Conference convened by the National Government in Luoyang in April of this year. This wish has been realized today. Therefore, this restoration of diplomatic relations and exchange of ambassadors between China and Russia is a measure that the government should take and a common practice in international relations. We hope that the people of both countries, in light of the long history and the border relationship, can form a sincere, frank, and permanent union, so as not to betray this innate situation. Soviet Russia's mass production will forever be developed in the Far East market and sincerely accepted by the 400 million people. Furthermore, the Chinese people are rich in the nature of peace and patience, and their national policy seeks only to obtain freedom and equality as the greatest wish. The struggles over the years have been purely peaceful and legal. Conspiracy and intrigue are deeply despised by China, and repaying evil with virtue is not allowed by the sages. As the situation in the Far East becomes increasingly bleak, all friendly countries that uphold justice, regardless of their history, political situation, or status, will be regarded as the good people of the 400 million people and given the greatest commercial convenience. Putting stones on someone who has fallen into a well is a public enemy of human mutual aid. Chinese citizens, in order to uphold human morality, should not be indiscriminate. All friendly countries should take note of this."</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Comforts the League of Nations Representatives</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Visits Consuls of Four Countries Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to Yan Guoguo, the Chinese representative attending the League of Nations in Geneva: "We greatly admire your efforts in negotiating and fighting for the country. However, there are still many difficulties and great responsibilities. We hope that you will express your great plans and achieve this complete success. Three million people in Shanghai offer incense and blessings. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>At this League of Nations conference, the representatives of the Czech Republic, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland have been able to advocate for justice for China, showing that there is still justice in the world. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Taxpaying Chinese Association, paid a special visit to the consuls of these countries in China yesterday morning to express goodwill and gratitude.</p>
<h3>Russian Residents Express Joy After the Restoration of Sino-Russian Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>There are Approximately 15,000 Russian Residents in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Russian Consulate General in Shanghai Will Soon Be Restored</p>
<p>........................................................................................</p>
<p>The Candidates for Ambassadors from Both Sides May Be Announced Soon</p>
<p>Sino-Russian diplomatic relations have been severed since 1927, a period of five years. During these five years, there has been no clear investigation of the status of Russian residents in China and other matters between the two countries. Now that Sino-Russian diplomatic relations have been restored, the two countries will become closer in the future, and a preliminary investigation is very important. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to various Russian institutions in Shanghai yesterday to inquire about the details, which are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Number of Russian Residents in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the severance of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations and the withdrawal of ambassadors and consuls from both sides, there has been no overall statistics on the number of Russian residents in China. Therefore, the exact number of Russian residents in Shanghai is temporarily impossible to investigate. According to Russian Association personnel yesterday, there are many White Russians in Shanghai, and about 15,000 have registered with the association. There are about 500 Red Russians in Shanghai. The number of Russians in Shanghai is already large, and in order to seek contact and friendship, there are organizations like the United Association of Russian Institutions in Shanghai, the Russian Association, the Chamber of Commerce, the Merchant Ship Association, the Relief Association, the United Association of Disabled Veterans, the Performing Arts Association, and the Russian Merchants Assistance Association. There is only one Russian school, located on Dumei Road.</p>
<h3>Russian Consulate to be Restored</h3>
<p>The former site of the Russian Consulate General in Shanghai is at No. 1 Huangpu Beach Road, a magnificent building. Since 1927, it has only had one Indian guard, and the scene is quite desolate. According to representatives from the Russian business community yesterday, personnel will be sent to repair it within days for use after the restoration of the consulate. The Russian embassy will be located in Nanjing to facilitate contact with all affairs. Russian consulates in other places such as Beiping, Tianjin, Hankou, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, and Fuzhou will also be restored in order. In places with fewer Russian residents, commercial offices will be established first.</p>
<h3>Candidates for Ambassadors from Both Sides</h3>
<p>Regarding the selection of ambassadors from both sides, the reporter inquired of a certain source from the Russian side yesterday. It was said that the candidate for the Soviet Russian ambassador to China could not be decided before the announcement. However, according to information obtained by this person, the current president of Moscow University, Lautik, and the former ambassador to China, Karakhan, have the highest calls. It is said that the Soviet people are very happy about the restoration of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations. It is said that the candidate for our country's ambassador to Russia has already been internally decided to be Yan Huiquing, the current minister to the United States.</p>
<h3>Russian Merchants Express Joy</h3>
<p>In order to understand the current status of Russian commerce in China, the reporter drove to visit Lai Wen, the manager of the Russian Merchants Assistance Association. According to him, Russian commerce has suffered great losses since the severance of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations in 1927, which has now lasted for five years. At the beginning of the severance of diplomatic relations, Russian merchants going to Hankou were sometimes detained by local military police on suspicion. Now that the restoration of diplomatic relations has been announced, the above-mentioned pain can be completely eliminated, and the Chinese and Russian people can now join hands in the Far East. The transportation of Russian goods to China has always been loaded and shipped abroad, which is very inconvenient. Today's urgent task is to restore navigation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou and Others Report</p>
<h3>Petition to Abolish War</h3>
<p>Each Member of the Central Committee Visited Expressed Approval</p>
<p>Hoping That All Circles of the Country Will Work Together to Promote Its Success</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou and Liu Zhan'en, representatives of the Great Alliance to Abolish Internal War who went to Beijing to petition, reported to the alliance yesterday from Beijing on the situation of the petition. The original letter is as follows: "Respectfully, Kanghou and Zhan'en were ordered to go to Beijing to petition the Third Plenary Session. On the evening of the 13th, they took the Beijing-Shanghai night train to Beijing. First, they met Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Conference, in the train, and talked about the work of the alliance, which was quite commended. He also agreed to contact the representatives attending the Third Plenary Session on behalf of the alliance. Yesterday morning, after arriving in Beijing, they first went to the Central Hotel to visit Mr. Zhang Yuejun and Mayor Wu Tiecheng, both of whom extremely supported the abolition of internal war and gave many instructions. They also had long talks and discussed fundamental methods for domestic peace, such as promoting constitutionalism and reforming politics. Then, together with Ran Xizhang, representative of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, (Pu Yangshan was on leave due to illness), they went to the Central Party Headquarters to submit the petition. They were received by Ye Chu'cang, a member of the Central Committee, who expressed great sympathy for the petition to abolish war. After a pleasant conversation, he accepted the petition and agreed to submit it to the Third Plenary Session for discussion, and expressed that we should study effective methods of sanction so that no internal war would occur in the country in the future. His attitude was extremely sincere. After leaving, they continued to visit most of the members of the Central Committee, Song Ziwen, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Dai Jitao, Chu Minyi, and Zhu Jium, and met the Living Buddha Zhangjia, to present the petition and they all expressed approval. They hoped that all circles of the country would work together with the alliance to promote the success of the abolition of internal war, so that all domestic construction projects could get on track. Finally, they met Xu Mo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, who also said that the most important thing to deal with the national crisis is to abolish internal war and first seek the unity of the country as a whole. Kanghou and Zhan'en observed that the main purpose of the central figures was to express sympathy and were happy to support the work of our association. The result of this trip was quite satisfactory. After the task was completed, they returned to Shanghai this morning. Respectfully, this report is presented to console you. Please examine it. This is a request to the Standing Committee of the Great Alliance to Abolish Internal War, Lin Kanghou and Liu Zhan'en respectfully."</p>
<h3>The Chinese Concession Police Agencies Were Temporarily on Alert Yesterday</h3>
<p>Four Suspects Were Found and the Evening Was Peaceful</p>
<p>Yesterday was the date for the opening of the Third Plenary Session in the capital. The Chinese and Concession police agencies in this city received reports that reactionary elements were taking the opportunity to operate. In order to maintain public order, they were temporarily on alert. The Municipal Public Security Bureau issued instructions to its subordinates to be on strict alert. After receiving the order, the police stations, detective teams, inspector's offices, and police brigades of each district immediately took strict precautions. All main roads were patrolled by double posts. At the junction of the Chinese and French concessions, inspectors and female inspectors were dispatched to check suspicious pedestrians. The Social Affairs Bureau of Xiaonanmen, the Lin Yin Road Municipal Party Headquarters, the South Railway Station, the Huashang Water and Electricity Company on Chezhan Road, and the Dnanmen Telephone Bureau were all assigned inspectors to lead police officers to guard them. After receiving the report, Yang Hu, the head of the Security Office, ordered the security brigade of the office to set up posts on the main roads at Xietu Road, Xie Xu Road, and the junction of the Chinese and foreign businesses. The police departments of the Public Concession and the French Concession notified the police to strengthen their defenses, especially in the western and eastern districts of Shanghai. When checking pedestrians in the area under the jurisdiction of the Sixth Police Station of the Caojiadu Municipal Public Security Bureau in western Shanghai yesterday morning, reactionary publications were found and four suspects were arrested on the spot and sent to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. In the evening, due to the strict precautions taken by the authorities, everything was as peaceful as usual, and the police officers who were temporarily deployed were also withdrawn.</p>
<h3>The Northwest Route Was Not Open Yesterday</h3>
<p>Due to Machine Repair, It Was Extended for One Day</p>
<p>Mail Was Carried by Plane from Peiping to Beijing</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation originally planned to open the northwest route to Xinjiang Province yesterday, and assigned the Eurasia No. 5 F13 Junkers plane, driven by the German [blank] Lavshebo, to go there. However, when it was scheduled to depart at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, the engine suddenly encountered an obstacle. Despite active repairs by craftsmen, it failed to fly out. The W33 plane from Beiping took off as usual. Therefore, the Shanghai company temporarily decided to postpone it for one day. The mail carried, about 14 kilograms, was changed to be sent to Beijing by the Beijing-Shanghai train. After the Peiping plane arrived in Luoyang, it would fly to Nanjing to pick up the load and then join the Shanghai plane to decide whether to fly to Dihua. Therefore, the original schedule would be delayed again.</p>
<h3>The Latest Invention: Microlight Wireless Telephone</h3>
<p>The World's Shortest Radio Waves</p>
<p>The Number of Vibrations per Second</p>
<p>Can Reach 200 Million Times</p>
<p>Scientific progress is changing with each passing day. The wireless telephone on the Italian wheel, which can transmit language as if conversing in the same room over tens of thousands of miles between Shanghai and Rome, has caused astonishment among Chinese people. However, this ordinary wireless telephone has become an old thing in today's scientific world. The latest invention is a wireless telephone that transmits with micro-light, and its wavelength can be shortened to less than one foot. This short-wave telephone was first put into practical use about eighteen months ago. The International Telegraph and Telephone Company, in its laboratory in London, England, and the laboratory of the Paris Telephone Materials Company, jointly installed it between the English and French Channels. Its wavelength is only 7.1 inches, which is a new invention in the electrical world. Yesterday, according to the Shanghai Telephone Company, the International Telegraph and Telephone Company telegraphed that the British Aviation Department had ordered the latest micro-light wireless radio from the Standard Telephone and Cable Company, a branch of the company in England. The wavelength has been shortened to 5.9 inches, which can be said to be the world's shortest wave. It will be installed at the British Lemn Airfield, and the French Aviation Department will also install the same radio at the Saint-Ingler-Faner Airfield to report on aircraft crossing the English Channel to each other. It is expected to be launched next spring.</p>
<p>According to this kind of short-wave radio, the transmitting and receiving antenna is less than one inch long. When generating electricity, a special micro-tube is used to generate vibrations that are sufficient to generate micro-light. The number of vibrations can reach 200 million times per second. This very rapid vibration is transmitted through the transmitting antenna, concentrated into a micro-beam by a set of mirrors, and sent to the sky by a circular reflecting mirror with a diameter of about ten feet to reach the same reflecting mirror of the receiving radio. The ones ordered by the British Aviation Department this time are also equipped with an electric printer at both ends, so that even if the receiving staff is temporarily away, the telegram can be automatically printed and stored. The advantages of micro-light wireless radio are: 1. It is almost completely unaffected by the weather; 2. Because the radio waves are very short, it can actually be free from the interference of nearby machines or radio waves.</p>
<p>Nie Kaiyi Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>The Reason Why the Wanxian Plane Was Destroyed</p>
<p>A Small Worker, Liu Dongtang, Was Burned</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Wanxian aircraft of the China Aviation Corporation (yesterday</p>
<h3>Pan Yunchao Asks for Assistance to the Righteous Army in Liaoxi and Jibi</h3>
<p>Japanese Bandits' Poisonous Plan to Destroy the Righteous Army</p>
<p>Intensifying the Advance and Launching a Large-Scale Encirclement</p>
<p>Promptly Allocate Funds for Assistance</p>
<p>To Prevent the Destruction of Strength</p>
<p>Pan Yunchao, director of the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Northeast National Salvation Army, sent a letter to the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, our army's Independent Seventh, Eighth, and Nineteenth detachments have fought against the enemy along the Jichang and Jihai lines. On December 8, we wrote to your association about the current difficult situation, and our army's political special envoy, Mr. Gao Yanzhang, went to report on the matter. Recently, the enemy army plans to take advantage of the severe cold, icy weather, and the lack of shelter and supplies for the righteous army, to intensify the advance and launch a large-scale encirclement, with the aim of destroying them one by one and eliminating them all. In particular, our army's Independent Seventh, Eighth, and Nineteenth detachments are close to the pseudo-capital, and the pressure is even greater. At the same time, due to the long distance, the transportation of ammunition is difficult, and funds are exhausted and there is no way to replenish them. Therefore, the situation is very difficult. As for the various departments of our army in western Liaoning, the First and Second Routes and the Independent Eighth and Twentieth Divisions, since the general attack on Jin Yi in October, they have gained and lost. Although the enemy and the rebels have suffered heavy losses, our side has also suffered great losses. They have been reorganizing and replenishing at the junction of Liaoning and Rehe, preparing to launch another attack. Recently, the enemy army has been provoking and disrupting in Yuguan on the one hand, and invading Rehe step by step on the other hand. Both have been launched one after another to fight against the enemy. However, due to economic constraints and heavy military expenses, they are struggling and it is difficult to last. Therefore, we request that your association consider the hard fighting situation of our army in western Liaoning and Jibi and other units, and promptly allocate funds for assistance, so that the strength of the righteous army will not be destroyed and the enemy's ambitions will not be realized."</p>
<p>Mistakenly Called Chongqing) Was Destroyed by Fire in Hankou. After receiving the report, the company sent Nie Kaiyi, deputy director of the Flight Navigation Group, to Hankou by the company's plane the day before yesterday morning to investigate. Now, Mr. Nie returned to Shanghai by plane at about 3:00 p.m. yesterday and went to the company to report the investigation to General Manager Dai. He told the Huadong News Agency reporter that the plane was named Wanxian, but the report said it was Chongqing, which is not accurate. As for the reason for the fire, it was because the gasoline in the plane evaporated due to the weather. At this time, a small worker, Liu Dongtang (from Hubei, over thirty years old), took a sampan (the plane was parked on the river) to the plane to turn on the electric lights, so that passing ships would know to give way and avoid danger. However, when Liu opened the door of the plane and stuck his head inside, the gasoline caught fire due to evaporation, burning Liu Dongtang's face and causing serious injuries. Liu was also knocked unconscious by the smoke and fell into the sampan he was riding in. The plane was completely burned due to the intense fire at the time, and even the scattered parts were probably useless. When I visited the injured Liu Dongtang in the hospital yesterday, I saw that his injuries were quite serious. The plane was insured by the American Old Jinshan and Good Hope Insurance Companies on the sixth floor of the Dalai Company at No. 3 Guangdong Road. According to Wu Zhaoxuan, director of the business group, the insurance stated that except when flying during the voyage, if there are losses on land, the insurance company will be responsible for compensation. The plane was purchased last year and has 575 horsepower. Its engine was replaced just a month ago and has only been used for thirty hours. It is a pity that it was destroyed by fire this time.</p>
<h3>Hongda Ship Returned to Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Exporting as Usual Tonight</p>
<p>The Hongda ship of the Datong Company was robbed on the morning of the 13th. After being released, the owner saw that no goods were lost and immediately sailed to Tongyang to load and unload goods. It returned safely to Shanghai from Yangzhou last night. The company immediately sent personnel to board the ship to check. It is said that although the ship was robbed this time, there were no other injuries except for the loss of silver dollars and clothes from the crew, passengers, and the ship's accounting office. The mechanical parts were also in good condition, so it will continue to operate as usual according to the schedule. It will depart from Shanghai to Yangzhou tonight as usual.</p>
<p>Wu Liande Reports on the Past Year</p>
<h3>Harbor Quarantine Achievements</h3>
<p>Thanks to the Assistance of All Parties</p>
<p>Reducing Human Mortality</p>
<p>The Shanghai Harbor Quarantine Administration held its third anniversary banquet at the East Asia Restaurant last night at 8:30 PM. More than a hundred guests attended, including Tang Hai'an, Qia Qing, and Wang Lai. During the banquet, Chairman Dr. Wu De gave a detailed report on the work of the year. American Consul General Mr. Cunningham gave a response. The banquet ended at 11 PM in high spirits. Dr. Wu's speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>"I am deeply honored by your presence and guidance tonight. On behalf of the Shanghai Harbor Quarantine Administration, I extend my welcome. In the past year, all our measures and work have been greatly aided by the consular corps, the shipping industry, and related organizations, enabling us to achieve some success. The future is long, and we still hope for your wise guidance. Now, I will briefly outline the work of this year."</p>
<p>(A) Overview of Wusong: At the beginning of this year, the Shanghai Incident suddenly broke out. Our medical officer in Wusong initially made every effort to continue working as usual. However, forced by the intense artillery fire, he eventually evacuated to Shanghai. All the clinics in Wusong and the nearby Xingyu were burned down by the artillery fire. Fortunately, the Shanghai Harbor Quarantine Hospital in Pudong remained intact. Recently, it has even installed its own electricity. New buildings have been constructed at the original site of the Wusong office, and the clinic has resumed normal operations there since the beginning of this month.</p>
<p>(B) Quarantine Work: Since February 1st of this year, all ships arriving in Shanghai have been subject to quarantine upon arrival. This method has been satisfactory and has not caused delays to navigation. Even during the cholera epidemic this summer, we inspected about 25 ships every day. All the quarantine personnel of our office worked diligently, and the results were quite good. Here is a list of the ships inspected in Shanghai and their tonnage from January 1st to December 10th of this year:</p>
<p>Inspected Ships</p>
<p>Number of Ships　　　　Tonnage</p>
<p>China　 108　　　 196,098</p>
<p>UK　 755　 5,138,396</p>
<p>USA　 210　 2,287,675</p>
<p>Japan　 712　 3,666,880</p>
<p>Norway　 148　　 642,497</p>
<p>Finland　 57　　 410,291</p>
<p>Germany　 82　　 631,847</p>
<p>France　 58　　 723,381</p>
<p>Other　 114　　 770,875</p>
<p>(C) Ship Fumigation: The ship fumigation department of our office has also been very active this year. A total of 9,733 ships were fumigated, with a total hold tonnage of 1,615,431 tons. The fumigation drugs used have been quite effective. This year, a total of 2,867 dead rats were collected during ship fumigation, compared to 2,086 last year.</p>
<p>(D) Rat and Flea Research: Since the beginning of this year, our office has begun to study the rats and fleas in Shanghai. This is of great significance to the issue of plague. From January to the end of November, a total of 691 live rats were captured, and 314,155 fleas were collected from the rats. However, no plague bacteria were found in the captured live rats or the dead rats collected during ship fumigation. Our branch offices in Guangzhou and Xiamen are also conducting similar work, under the commission of the League of Nations Health Organization's Plague Research Department.</p>
<p>(E) Cooperation Among Departments: The epidemic prevention department, the ship fumigation department, and the medical department of our office all have interconnected work. Let me give an example: When a ship arrives in Shanghai from a plague-infected port, it is first inspected by the medical officer of the epidemic prevention department. If cholera is found, the ship is detained, and the ship fumigation department handles the disinfection. The medical department then handles the patients and contacts, and performs cholera vaccination and bacterial examinations.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>After all procedures are completed, the ship is released. This is an example of cooperation among the departments.</p>
<p>(F) Purchasing New Vessels: For the convenience of our work, our office began building a new ship last year, named "Hua Tuo," which will be put into use within one or two weeks. Including the previous ones, we will have a total of three steamers and two fumigation boats.</p>
<p>(G) Establishing Quarantine Branch Offices: Our office originally had a plan to unify the quarantine affairs of all seaports in the country. Therefore, the quarantine affairs of Tianjin, Tanggu, and Qinhuangdao were gradually taken back from the local customs offices in April. The Wuhan branch office has also started ship fumigation work, which is very convenient for ships in the Wuhan area. The Xiamen branch office has the best performance and serves as a model for other branch offices. When smallpox and cholera were prevalent in the area and other ports, the branch office was able to handle the situation with ease in the shortest amount of time. New migrant housing is under construction, and the new steamer that was added has also begun construction.</p>
<p>(H) Preventing the Spread of Cholera: The widespread and ferocious nature of the cholera epidemic this year is rare in Chinese history. The first case of cholera in Shanghai was discovered on April 26th, and the last case was discovered on October 17th, with a total epidemic period of 175 days. There were a total of 4,295 patients and 318 deaths, including 75 foreign patients and 20 deaths. Therefore, the mortality rate for foreigners was 26%, while the mortality rate for Chinese was only 7%. The incidence rate for Chinese was only 10 per 1,000 people, while the incidence rate for foreigners was 15 per 1,000 people. Shanghai was able to achieve this good result of a minimum mortality rate thanks to the concerted efforts of various health organizations and the public. In addition to inspecting ships, our office also vaccinated thousands of people.</p>
<p>(I) Rescuing Refugees and Wounded Soldiers: During the Shanghai Incident, refugees and wounded soldiers moved from the war zone to the public and French concessions. Our office immediately sent medical officers to work with various groups to rescue them. There were a total of 56 shelters, accommodating about 22,000 refugees. We also participated in the treatment of wounded soldiers and injured refugees at the Meibige Road Hospital. The hospital was established at the beginning of the war and closed at the end of April.</p>
<p>One more point I must mention to you: In October of this year, Dr. Hu Hongji, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, was killed in a car accident. My colleagues and I were deeply saddened by the news. Dr. Hu was not only a health expert, but also made many contributions to public health. Both last year and this year, Dr. Hu greatly assisted in the cholera prevention campaign and the Cholera Prevention Institute I presided over. His contributions should not be forgotten or left unrecorded. Finally, I must declare that all the work of our office has been fully supported by the Shanghai and other port customs offices, the consular corps, and the shipping industry. The news media has also done its best to publish information to increase public health knowledge, for which we are deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau North Wharf Operates As Usual</h3>
<p>He Tiehua Arrives at Wharf Yesterday to Take Office</p>
<p>Refuses He Group's Petition to the Head Office</p>
<p>After all the employees of the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf opposed He Tiehua's return to the North Wharf, refused to hand over, and all resigned, General Manager Liu Hongsheng, in order to maintain passenger and cargo handling, specially dispatched personnel yesterday morning to work with the employees who were working as usual to take charge of the tallying department to ensure that passengers and cargo would not be affected. The newly appointed wharf director He Tiehua arrived at the wharf as usual to take office, and the Huishan Police Station increased the number of Chinese and foreign armed detectives stationed at the North Station to protect the work. The employees of the Fifth Wharf rejected the He Group, held a large meeting at the Jinliyuan Wharf at 9:00 AM yesterday and resolved: (1) to establish a presidium with 11 chairpersons; (2) to establish five departments, including general affairs, secretary, publicity, transportation, and maintenance, to allocate work; (3) to decide to petition the board of directors at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to request that they uphold justice in order to remedy the situation and achieve the purpose of withdrawing the order. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, more than 120 members of the He Group rejection group gathered at Jinliyuan Wharf and walked to the head office to petition. After arriving at the office, they gathered in the auditorium. Jiang Yinkui, Zhang Guiqing, Wang Xingcun, Shan Xishou, Yao Lianbai, and others were selected to go to the board of directors. After the Laozha Police Station received the report, they immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign armed detectives to guard the area. The board of directors dispatched General Manager Liu Hongsheng to reply to the employee representatives, saying that the China Merchants Bureau is a state-run shipping industry, and advised them to work with peace of mind as soon as possible. As for the employees of the North Wharf, if they have no major faults at ordinary times, they will never be dismissed. If they commit major faults, they will be dismissed. They also set a deadline of the 16th to resume work, otherwise, in order to maintain business, they will all be dismissed. The two sides remained at odds until 5:00 PM, and then they dispersed and returned to the Fifth Wharf Workers' Association to discuss and decided to convene an emergency general meeting at 9:00 PM to discuss how to proceed.</p>
<h3>The Reason Why Kong Xiangxi Is Staying in the United States</h3>
<p>Unable to Return in Time to Participate in the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy for the inspection of European and American industries, set sail on September 2nd, as reported in various newspapers. According to a New York communication, Kong arrived in San Francisco in late September and transferred to the American Transcontinental Railway to go to the Eastern United States. Along the way, he passed through Dingbao, St. Louis, and Chicago, and stayed in each place for three to five days, examining in detail the farms, factories, and trading markets in each place. He arrived in New York in early October. In addition to investigating the industrial and commercial situation there, he repeatedly responded to invitations from leaders from all walks of life and Chinese and foreign groups to attend lectures, giving a good impression to the people of that country. In late October, when he transferred to Washington, D.C., it was the time of the presidential election. President Hoover was about to go on a tour, so he made time to meet and talk for more than half an hour. Both sides expressed their sincere desire to enhance Sino-American relations. Later, he met with Secretary of State Stimson several times, and they had a very harmonious conversation. In addition, he visited the Undersecretaries of the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, and the Department of Labor, and visited their headquarters and affiliated agencies, examining their organization and administration in detail. In early November, Kong returned to New York. He originally planned to go to Europe immediately, but he happened to meet the Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was elected as the next president. Kong had direct or indirect relations with various important figures of the Democratic Party, so he could not avoid contacting them briefly. In addition, factories in Pittsburgh and other places were still inviting him to visit, so the date of his trip to Europe had to be postponed slightly. It is heard that the government will hold the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee in mid-December, and has telegraphed Kong to return to the country to attend. In this situation, it is feared that he will not be able to return in time.</p>
<h3>The Third Edition of Shenbao Monthly is Published</h3>
<p>Since the publication of the inaugural issue of Shenbao Monthly in July of this year, it has been well received by all sectors of society and has been selling exceptionally well. The first edition of the first and second issues sold out in mid-September. Therefore, a second edition was printed in mid-October. However, by the beginning of last month, not only had the second edition of the first and second issues sold out, but the first edition of the third and fourth issues had also sold out at the same time. However, subscribers are still very enthusiastic and are requesting to subscribe from the inaugural issue. In order to repay the kind intentions of the annual commemorative subscribers, the company has specially reprinted the first and second issues in a third edition, and added a second edition of the third and fourth issues to meet the demand. It is now heard that the third edition and the second edition of the monthly magazines have been published, so those who wish to subscribe from the inaugural issue of the magazine will not have the regret of missing out. It is also heard that the special New Year's issue of the magazine has rich content and has been sent for typesetting early. It will be published in early next month. The retail price will be increased, but subscribers will not be charged extra, in order to show preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>The Contract for Building Roads and Telephones Beyond the Boundary is Scheduled to be Signed</h3>
<p>Long-Term Contract to be Discussed Again Next Spring</p>
<p>The text of the contract for building roads and telephones beyond the boundary has been revised by both parties, and detailed boundary maps have been drawn up in duplicate. At the same time, the telephone company has also been reviewed and approved by the board of directors a few days ago. According to a definite message from the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities yesterday, the Ministry of Transportation will send personnel to Shanghai within the next few days to formally hold a meeting with the telephone company, the telephone bureau, and the Bureau of Public Utilities on the 20th of this month to sign the contract. This temporary contract is only for one year, so the Ministry of Transportation, the Telephone Bureau, and the Shanghai Telephone Company must continue to sign a long-term contract based on the temporary contract. As for the continuation of the contract, it will be discussed again in the spring of the 22nd year after the contract signed this time is tried out.</p>
<h3>Citizens Continue to Inspect Inferior Goods on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>Fifty-One Companies Obtain Certificates</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Citizens' Association, in order to address the fact that member stores on the road had mostly cleaned up inferior goods earlier, and being afraid that patriotic elements would not be able to distinguish between good and bad and would easily start misunderstandings, specially produced a joint certificate to be issued to the inspected stores for identification and maintenance of guarantees. Now, several more stores have submitted letters of intent to the association to apply for certificates. Therefore, at 2:00 PM yesterday, three members, accompanied by industry specialists, went to conduct a fair investigation. The result confirmed that the inferior goods of these companies had indeed been sealed and stopped from being sold. It is expected that the certificates will be issued today. It is heard that among those who obtained the certificates this time, there are five companies: Yuchangxiang, Jicheng, Huaying, Hengdeli, and Tongchunxiang, for a total of fifty-one companies together with the previous ones.</p>
<h3>Unnamed Heroes Fundraising to Build a Tomb</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Enthusiastically Promotes</p>
<p>Many of those who sacrificed their lives in the war of resistance against Japan did not have known surnames. Therefore, Shanghai associations plan to build a tomb for unnamed heroes in Miaohang. Since the committee was established and newspaper fundraising began, donations from all sectors of society have been very enthusiastic. It is also heard that when Mayor Wu went to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, he sent a telegram before leaving, instructing the association to be listed as an initiator to promote the cause.</p>

<h3>Thugs Assault Sanyou Factory Workers</h3>
<p>Workers Chen Jintang and others are seriously injured</p>
<p>Ten Assailants Arrested and Sent to Court</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Society in Yinxiang Port, Shanghai East, has lasted nearly a year. Although the municipal government has mediated, the court has ruled, and various parties have made well-intentioned mediation attempts, the capital side has not accepted them, leading to an unresolved situation. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, for some unknown reason, more than twenty thugs suddenly appeared and beat workers such as Chen Jintang, causing injuries. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Sudden Appearance of Thugs</h3>
<p>At around 10 a.m. yesterday morning, while the factory workers were having lunch inside the factory, more than twenty thugs, including Wu Bingyi, Bao Yuqing, and Yang Changlin, carrying weapons, sneaked into the factory building. Without asking any questions, they started beating anyone they saw. The workers were caught off guard and had no chance to resist. As a result, Chen Jintang's head was injured by an axe, Zhou Shengfu suffered severe injuries to his waist and chest, Wu Songshou's left leg bone was broken by an iron bar, and several others suffered minor injuries.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Assailants</h3>
<p>When the assault occurred, fortunately, the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District and the police detachment stationed at the factory heard the alarm and immediately worked together to arrest the assailants. Ten people were apprehended, including Yang Changlin, Yang Mingfa, Luo Jifu, Luo Ailin, Bu Zhengcai, Zhang Xiucai, Lin Xianshou, Wang Xueming, Zhang Huagui, and Luo Shengfu. They were taken to the station along with the injured workers.</p>
<h3>Transfer to the Court</h3>
<p>After questioning by the police station chief, the case was deemed criminal and was immediately transferred to the local court for disposal with a written report. The assailants were temporarily detained. Meanwhile, a forensic doctor examined the injuries of the injured workers, and they were allowed to seek medical treatment at the hospital themselves. It is reported that the procuratorate has decided to file a public prosecution.</p>
<h3>Route Change for Bus Line No. 7</h3>
<p>Facilitates North-South Transportation in the Western District</p>
<p>The Public Omnibus Company of the Public Concession, in order to facilitate the north-south line transportation in the western district, has obtained permission from the Public Works Department to change the route of Bus Line No. 7. It will now travel from the intersection of Haig Road and Hongqiao Road to Jing'an Temple, then onto Great Western Road, turning into Avenue Road, passing Jiaozhou Road, Rue Robert, and Xiaoshadu Road, until the intersection of Yichang Road. Previously, Bus Line No. 7 went to Jing'an Temple and then via Yu Garden Road and Bubbling Well Road to Wujiaochang. Now that Route A buses are already running in the Yu Garden Road area and are sufficient to carry passengers, Bus Line No. 7 can be rerouted.</p>
<h3>Good Health Status in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>The Public Health Director's report to the Board of Directors for November stated that the death rate among foreigners in the concession this month was 10.17, compared to 18.34 in the same month last year. The death rate among Chinese was 13.23, compared to 14.80 in the same month last year. Therefore, the health status of this port can be considered exceptionally good.</p>
<p>Rare Infectious Diseases The statistics for infectious diseases do not show anything particularly noteworthy, except for a slight increase in scarlet fever. Pulmonary tuberculosis and intestinal diseases remain as common as usual. The number of diphtheria cases among Chinese is quite high, while the number among foreigners is lower than in previous years. There are not many cases of smallpox, but vaccination work is being actively carried out. Within the month, 14,649 people were vaccinated by vaccination vehicles, and 8,419 people were vaccinated by various health sub-bureaus.</p>
<p>Pathological Laboratory Research The results of this month's research show that splenitis is quite common in slaughtered cattle. The pharmaceutical section produced 161 grams of bovine pulp this month and issued 34,560 doses of vaccine and 199 doses of micro-Ranson's emulsion. The laboratory received 1,261 specimens for microbiological examination and 239 specimens for analysis this month. The analysis work included diphtheria, meningitis, malaria, etc. The Pasteur treatment room had 52 patients this month, including three from other ports. There were no deaths among those treated.</p>
<p>Food Supply Milk production averaged 24,425 pounds per day. Thirty-six samples were tested, of which five were unsanitary, two were deficient in fat, one was adulterated with water, and three were mixed with buffalo milk. Ninety-nine samples were analyzed, of which eleven were unqualified, but all came from Class B or unregistered dairy farms. The number of cattle slaughtered this month increased, while the number of other livestock decreased, but all were higher than the average for the previous year. Business at various vegetable markets was quite good. Bakeries and food stores have improved significantly.</p>
<p>Hygiene Division Work With the arrival of winter, fly and mosquito control work has decreased, while vaccination is very busy. Mosquito breeding this year has lasted for a long time, probably due to the warmer weather. To check the sanitary conditions of schools receiving subsidies, an inspector has been assigned to take charge of this matter.</p>

<p>His Friends Present Him with a Complete Collection of Song Dynasty Li Xue Classics</p>

Dr. Mann's friends in Shanghai held a celebration for him yesterday at the Astor House Hotel, raising their glasses to offer him birthday wishes. They also knew that Dr. Mann was dedicated to books and classics, so they made great efforts to search and obtain a complete collection of Song Dynasty Li Xue classics, presenting it to Dr. Mann to peruse and commemorate. It is reported that the German Consul General in Shanghai, Feng Lide, Consul Bai Rende, and other famous German僑 were present at yesterday's grand banquet.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Electricity Company Temporarily Does Not Cut Off Power</h3>
<p>Respecting the Intentions of the Local Authorities</p>
<p>Decision to Continue Maintenance Method</p>
<p>The Zhenhai Electricity Company previously decided to cut off power starting on the 16th of this month because users were unwilling to pay the actual usage fees, which affected the company's income. A meeting of all promoters and shareholders was convened on the 4th of this month to discuss the matter. After hearing the news, the various party, government, military, and police agencies in the county believed that electricity was very important for maintaining security during the current winter defense period in Zhenhai. They jointly sent a letter to the promoter, Fu Xiaoan, requesting that he continue to maintain the power supply. After receiving the letter, Fu held a general meeting of all parties at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the matter. First, Chairman Wu Yaqin reported on the letters from the director of the Water Police Bureau, the commander of the Fort, the commander of the garrison battalion, the members of the Party Department, the magistrate of Zhenhai County, and the director of the Public Security Bureau. After discussion, it was generally agreed that the heads of various agencies had expressed their willingness to assist the company in the shortest possible time, and that they had also ordered that the actual amount owed be paid in full, which would alleviate most of the difficulties faced by the company. Next, Qian Zhongjun, Zhu Huanwen, Xie Weishan, Yu Shouchun, Dai Chengzhi, Zhou Jianhan, and others successively made proposals, and the following resolutions were unanimously passed: 1. In order to respect the intentions of the heads of various agencies, the power supply will be continued for another half month. 2. Within this half month, all users who owe fees must pay the full amount in order to clear the procedures. 3. If users still cannot pay the fees owed within half a month, the power supply will be cut off starting on January 1st of next year and will not be continued. 4. If users can pay the fees owed before the end of this year, the trial operation will be continued for another three months. 5. If the trial operation proceeds smoothly and actual usage is paid for, then further efforts will be made to continue soliciting shares and paying the money to formally establish the company; otherwise, the operation will be terminated after the trial period expires. 6. All users, regardless of who they are, will pay for actual usage and there will be no discounts or deductions forever. 7. The above resolutions will be submitted to the Jiangsu Construction Department and the Zhenhai County Government for record, and will be sent to various agencies and legal entities for reference. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Utility Bureau Auctions Cargo Ship</h3>
<p>Confiscated for Dodging Taxes</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Shipping Office of the Municipal Public Utility Bureau previously discovered a cargo ship with the serial number 5446. The stamped serial number and the ship's classification did not match, indicating that a lower-grade license had been used in an attempt to reduce taxes. The bureau confiscated the ship in accordance with the city's regulations on cracking down on cargo ships. It is reported that the municipal government has approved the public sale of the ship at the Shanghai South Shipping Office (Dongjiadu Wharf) at 10 a.m. on the 17th of this month. The proceeds will be remitted to the municipal treasury. Those who wish to purchase the ship can go to the office at that time to view the ship and make arrangements.</p>

The Chief reported that Committee Member Li Zushen of the National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee attended the meeting yesterday and invited them to survey the dike construction in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces. The dikes were wide, high, and strong, and the project was of great benefit to the country's economy and people's livelihood. After consultation with Committee Member Li, it was proposed to change the project of the万里long dike on the north and south banks into万里堤路, which could both protect the dike and facilitate transportation, benefiting both water and land transportation. The drafting and design of engineers, soldiers, and road builders, as well as the future inter-provincial automobile transportation plans across the dike, are being submitted to the Executive Yuan for circulation to the relevant provinces and regions and the National Government's Water Disaster Committee for adoption and implementation.

The rest will be carried out actively according to the outline of the plan. The three added items should be given special attention and urged forward at any time. Resolved to comply. Temporary proposals were omitted.</p>

<h3>Public Memorial Service for Xu Fengweng Not to be Held</h3>
<p>Xu Jingren Resolutely Declined in Accordance with His Father's Will</p>
<p>Previously, leaders of various charities in the city and celebrities from all walks of life initiated a public memorial service for Xu Yutang Fengweng, scheduled to be held on January 3, 22nd year, at the Buddhist Jingye Society on Hart Road. The call for essays had been published in various newspapers. This time, Chairman Xu Jingren returned to Shanghai from Wuhan and learned of this event. Because he strictly abided by Xu Fengweng's will, which stipulated that during times of national crisis, ceremonies should be simple and frugal, with no mourning and no obituaries, he did not dare to accept the public memorial service initiated by the elders and acquaintances from all walks of life in the city. He has already expressed his most sincere respect and gratitude to the initiators of the public memorial service and resolutely declined. It is planned not to hold the service.</p>
<h3>Actress Lin Yongyong Abuses Maid</h3>
<p>Charity Society Intervenes to Provide Relief</p>
<p>Lin Yongyong, an actress at the Xinxin Rooftop Garden New Theater, about 30 years old, from Suzhou, lives at 714 and a half, Meifu Lane, Parker Road. During the Shanghai War, she bought a 12-year-old girl named Wang Azhen from the refugees for 120 yuan to be her maid, forcing her to do hard labor and arbitrarily abusing her, even beating her cruelly, which was inhumane. This was heard by the中华慈幼协会 at No. 20 Museum Road. The association immediately sent two staff members, Zhang Yueru and Ding Dongnan, accompanied by a Western detective from the Avenue Road police station, to conduct an on-site investigation. They found that Wang Azhen, the maid, had numerous scars on her face and arms, which they learned were caused by Lin Yongyong hitting her with a ruler. Lin Yongyong was arrested and questioned and the girl was sent to Guangren Hospital for a medical examination. It is reported that she will be handed over to the court for trial at 9 a.m. today.</p>
<h3>Da Zhonghua Scientific Research Association Visits Zhanghua Woolen Mill</h3>
<p>The Da Zhonghua Scientific Research Association was founded by Wu Zhihui. It has been established for seven years, but has been suspended due to various reasons. It was re-established this summer, focusing on popularizing scientific knowledge and technology, and guiding social production and consumption. Those who join are enthusiastic about science. Yesterday, more than 40 ordinary members of the association in Shanghai, at the invitation of Cheng Nianpeng, the manager of the Zhanghua Woolen Manufacturing Company in Zhoujiadu, crossed the river accompanied by Tong Xinzhi, a senior employee of the company, and Xu Yunzhi, the executive director of the association, to visit the manufacturing process from wool selection to finished products. The engineers of the factory, Xi and Pan, explained the process to them. The members of the association praised the factory's equipment and management. After the visit, they had refreshments in the factory's living room and took a photograph.徐 Yunzhi, the new executive director of the association, told people that Zhanghua was able to spin, weave, and produce finished products without any foreign raw materials, which was truly commendable in the current Chinese wool industry. However, the engine still used steam power, which consumed too much energy, which was a slight drawback. According to the factory, it has decided to switch to electricity next year in order to realize this. They are extremely grateful for Xu's suggestion.</p>

He then rented a house in the French Concession at No. 12 Guifu Lane, Taiping Bridge, and No. 38 Juxing Lane, Beidi Road, and lived together. In September of this year, their relationship suddenly broke down, causing Li's mother to sue Fang for seduction and abandonment in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, demanding payment of 30,000 yuan for living expenses. However, one wave subsided, and another rose. Recently, Fang's</p>
<h3>Legal Wife Cai Huiying</h3>
<p>Also because Fang smoked opium, contracted a venereal disease, and was unbearable to abuse, hired lawyers Gu Xianzhang and others to file a complaint in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting a divorce and demanding 50,000 yuan in alimony. The complaint stated that the plaintiff, on the eighth day of the first month of the 20th year of the Republic, married Fang Jiali, a wealthy man, at the behest of her parents and through the mediation of Shen Chenghua and Yang Ruheng. After the marriage, the relationship was harmonious and joyful, and she deeply rejoiced at having found a good man. Therefore, the defendant deceptively said that</p>
<h3>He Would Take Away the Plaintiff's Jewelry</h3>
<p>Take it away for safekeeping, and not give it back. Afterwards, the defendant's attitude changed drastically, and he regarded the plaintiff as a thorn in his side. His words and actions were always inappropriate, and he even beat her. He repeatedly made excuses to leave Shanghai and travel for months without returning. He did not care about the plaintiff's food, clothing, housing, and other expenses. People were full of rumors, saying that the defendant had a lover before marrying the plaintiff. Because it was during the honeymoon period, she did not want to accuse him of this kind of baseless talk, which would lead to an irreparable rift in their relationship. Knowing that the wind comes from an empty cave, it is definitely not without reason, but she still hoped that he would stray from the right path and eventually change his ways, so that they could grow old together. However, she did not expect the defendant to have made it a habit. He already</p>
<h3>Was Indulging in Opium</h3>
<p>Greedily smoking opium, and also visiting prostitutes (Feng Jun, Lao Qi, etc., on Shantou Road), contracting an incurable disease, and hiding mistresses in houses (No. 27 Xicheng Lane, Ximen Road, etc., five places), leading to lawsuits (Criminal Case No. 152, 21st year of the Republic). When she tried to dissuade him, he dared to threaten her with a pistol. In this dangerous situation, if the plaintiff continued to compromise, her health would be a concern. If she continued to abide by the marital rules, her safety would be at risk. The plaintiff was unwilling to continue to blindly endure suffering and sit and wait for death. In order to avoid</p>
<h3>Future Suffering</h3>
<p>She filed a complaint with the court, requesting permission to divorce, ordering the defendant to pay the plaintiff 50,000 yuan in alimony, and to recover her clothing, jewelry, and to bear all litigation costs in this case. At the end of the complaint, she added that on October 15th of this year, because the mediation failed, the defendant publicly stated in the 10th court of the court when he was leaving, "Willing to fill the yamen with foreign money, the magistrate only wants," which the plaintiff's agent requested to be recorded in the minutes at the time, and requested special attention to it in the future, so as to be a warning to the unrighteous. Upon receiving the complaint, the court summoned Fang Jiali to appear in the 5th Civil Court yesterday afternoon, presided over by Magistrate Ding De. Fang Jiali did not appear, and hired lawyer Chen Ruili to appear on his behalf. First, Cai Huiying, the plaintiff, stated that she was from Qingpu, 21 years old, and was currently residing temporarily at No. 11 Xingyi Lane, West Cang Road, in the city. She married the defendant on the eighth day of the first month of last year. About two weeks later, he took away my clothing and jewelry, saying this,</p>
<h3>Fang Jiali's Mother</h3>
<p>Suddenly stood up from the audience and scolded the plaintiff loudly. Magistrate Ding stopped her, telling her that the audience should maintain order and not make arbitrary noise. If she disturbed the order of the court, the court could detain her or impose a fine. She then sat down silently. Cai then continued, after taking away her clothing and jewelry, he left and did not return for about two months. After returning home, she was beaten when she mentioned her clothing and jewelry. He smoked opium all day long, gambled, and took a concubine, which led to his concubine suing him this year. When she tried to dissuade him, he wanted to</p>
<h3>Hit Her with a Pistol</h3>
<p>She was beaten and injured again on February 25th of this year and was treated at the hospital. She had a medical certificate. The defendant also suffered from淋 病, a serious disease. Because she could not bear this suffering, she filed a complaint with the court, requesting a divorce and ordering him to pay alimony of 300 yuan per month, totaling 50,000 yuan, and submitted a medical certificate, a statement of Fang's assets, and a newspaper report on Li Sanyuan's lawsuit for the court to examine. Chen Ruili, the defendant's agent, stated that the defendant did not have any ill feelings towards the plaintiff and loved her very much.</p>
<h3>Third-Party Instigation</h3>
<p>Unexpectedly filing a complaint with your esteemed court, claiming that all the points stated by the plaintiff are entirely untrue and that there is no factual basis to prove them. Furthermore, the submitted medical certificate is in English and should be ordered to be translated into Chinese by the plaintiff's lawyer. Fang Jiali is traveling to [place name] for business today and will be available for cross-examination in court next time, and so on. Judge Ding reported that marital discord is unavoidable and should be resolved peacefully to maintain affection, and that it is not advisable to litigate in court. Therefore, both parties were advised to negotiate a settlement outside of court. This judge has slightly extended the case and rescheduled the hearing to allow ample opportunity for negotiation, and the hearing is being rescheduled and re-summoned.</p>
<h3>Problem of Restoring Electricity</h3>
<p>Questioning How the Power Company Can Determine and Execute Penalties on its Own</p>
<p>Looking Back, the Municipal Council Still Sought Punishment from the Court, Emphasizing the Rule of Law</p>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association sent another letter to the Municipal Council urging the restoration of electricity to Laoyan Maoyuan, stating: We are writing to you on behalf of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, regarding a letter from member Laoyan Maoyuan Liquor Store, claiming that our store was falsely accused by the Shanghai Power Company of tampering with the electricity meter and was ordered to pay an additional electricity fee of over two thousand taels. Because we believed this was unreasonable harassment, they cut off our electricity on November 11, causing significant business losses. We have previously requested the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association to uphold fairness and justice, and the association has forwarded a letter to the Municipal Council requesting a stop to this action, and the Municipal Council has also sent a letter to the power company requesting correction. However, many days have passed, and the power company has not complied, nor has the Municipal Council taken any action. This delay is causing even greater losses. Therefore, we are requesting your association to forward another letter to the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association, urging the Municipal Council to expedite the negotiation to maintain business interests, and so on. According to our investigation, since Laoyan Maoyuan installed the electricity meter, the company has sent a specialist to read the meter every month, and until the final removal, there were no claims of tampering with the meter's lead seals. The meter was taken to the company, and only after several days did this accusation arise. Even if there were traces of tampering, it is impossible to prove whether they were interchanged with other meters or fabricated, and Laoyan Maoyuan cannot be held responsible. If it is claimed that the difference in electricity usage, past and present, raises suspicion of fraud, the business of a store fluctuates, and the amount of electricity used naturally varies. The current meter reading cannot be used as a standard for past electricity usage. Moreover, electricity is a public utility, and the public interest should be the priority. If the company can do whatever it wants, demand whatever it wants, and disregard the public interest simply because it is a monopoly, that is unreasonable. The company's forceful cutoff of electricity is not in line with proper practices. Based on the aforementioned situation, we are forwarding this letter to your association, requesting you to immediately urge the Municipal Council to order the Shanghai Power Company to restore the electricity supply to Laoyan Maoyuan to maintain business interests. We have previously sent a letter to your bureau requesting an investigation, but no results have been received to date, resulting in significant business losses for the store. The Shanghai Power Company determines and executes penalties on its own, leaving no room for taxpayers to voice their grievances or seek redress. We wonder what effective measures your bureau, which is responsible for safeguarding the legal rights of taxpayers, has to correct this barbaric and oppressive behavior. We recall that during the time when the power company was managed by the Electricity Department of your bureau, a certain Lin used illegal procedures, and the case was brought to the Mixed Court for punishment. Your bureau, as the local administrative authority, still emphasized the rule of law and did not determine and execute penalties on its own. If this situation is not promptly corrected administratively (since the company's actions constitute direct action, the administration should be responsible for correction), all the characteristics of the rule of law within the concession will be completely destroyed by the company. This is a serious matter. Based on the aforementioned reasons, we are writing to your bureau, requesting you to promptly order the Shanghai Power Company to restore the electricity supply to the store. Addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement.</p>

<h3>Miserable Death of a Tent Keeper on a Road Under Repair</h3>
<p>Three Men in Short Clothes Wielding Sharp Axes</p>
<p>Four Axe Blows Cost a Life</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 3:30 AM, an assassination occurred at the intersection of Beijing Road and Fujian Road. Recently, the Municipal Council dispatched road workers to repair the road at that location. After the workers finished for the night, an individual, Mr. Jia, around fifty years old, was assigned to guard all the road construction equipment inside a tent beside the road. At approximately 3:30 AM yesterday morning, three men wearing short clothes suddenly appeared, wielding sharp axes. Catching Mr. Jia off guard, they attacked him with the axes. Mr. Jia fell to the ground in extreme pain. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the assailants fled. Later, a Chinese constable, number 3057, patrolled by the area and discovered the incident. Seeing that Mr. Jia was unconscious, he urgently transported him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he soon died. The hospital reported the incident to the police, who transported the body to the coroner's office for examination and to investigate the deceased's name and family and to pursue the murderers. Later, it was learned that the deceased was Tian Dexin from Tianjin, 56 years old, wearing a black cotton-padded coat and trousers, with an old Western-style coat over it, and a velvet hat. He was struck by four axe blows, on the top of the head, left cheek, left back of the head, and nose, with the blow to the top of the head being the most severe, causing his death.</p>

<h3>Begging Repeatedly to Avoid Death</h3>
<p>Zhu Yan, a Woman from Jiaxing, Has a Fateful Destiny</p>
<p>Liu Hongkui Commits All Kinds of Evil and Should Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>Zhu Yan, a 37-year-old woman from Jiaxing, currently residing at No. 10 Huiyuan Lane, Kunshan Road, was escorted by a fellow townsman to the 3rd precinct of the 5th district to file a complaint. She stated that in June of this year, the defendant lured her to Shanghai from Jiaxing under the pretense of taking her to a used goods store, and brought her nine-year-old daughter with her. However, the defendant pawned all of Ms. Zhu's capital and clothing. In August, due to financial constraints, Ms. Zhu was sold to Luzhou, Anhui. Her nine-year-old daughter was taken by the defendant's wife. At that time, the defendant lived on Huade Road. Because Ms. Zhu could not bear the hardship, she escaped to Shanghai in August. When she went to the defendant's residence to look for her daughter, she was nowhere to be found. When she questioned him, the defendant lied to her that the daughter was in Pudong and led Ms. Zhu to Gaolang Bridge, specifically walking through graveyards and deserted areas, claiming it was a shortcut. It was already 11 PM. The defendant took out a long rope and tied up Ms. Zhu, intending to harm her. Ms. Zhu begged repeatedly, appealing to their previous relationship and promising not to seek her daughter again. The defendant then released Ms. Zhu. Unexpectedly, the next day, he lured her again, saying that her daughter was now in Bengbu, just to scare her, and they could go together to pick her up. So they took the Datong steamer to Bengbu, and then he took her to Liu Township, more than a hundred li away, and sold her to an old man named Liu Changshun to be his wife. Because Ms. Zhu cried incessantly, Liu felt sympathetic and sent her to Nanjing to find relatives before returning to Shanghai. Therefore, she arrested the defendant and requested a severe punishment. When questioned, the defendant was evasive. Because the case was extremely complex, it was transferred to the local court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Reader's Advisor</h3>
<p>Ms. Wu Asks: Mr. So-and-so and I developed from friendship to love, and it has been more than three years. Last year, we asked two teachers, the director of academic affairs and the Chinese teacher of a certain middle school, to introduce us and establish a marriage contract (we are both already eighteen years old, and according to the newly announced law, we have the right to freely choose a spouse). Each of us holds one copy, and in the future, neither party can change it. This year, we asked someone to discuss it with my father, but he refused to agree. Alas! I am really in a dilemma. If I carry out our marriage contract, I will be disobeying my parents' orders. If I obey my parents' orders, Mr. So-and-so has put in a lot of effort for me, and if I change my mind halfway, wouldn't I be doing him wrong in my conscience? Gentlemen! I have discussed it with my father, but it didn't work. Now I want the marriage contract to be carried out, as long as my father and I don't have any disagreements, and we can still be happy. Father and daughter are father and daughter, husband and wife are husband and wife. What method can be used to start?</p>
<p>Answer: The question in the letter can be answered in two points:</p>
<p>(1) Legal Aspects: According to the current Civil Code, "A minor entering into a marriage contract shall obtain the consent of his or her legal representative." Although the woman was already eighteen years old when she entered into the marriage contract, according to Article 12 of the Civil Code: "Full twenty years of age is adulthood," the woman is still a "minor." A minor is a "person with limited capacity for conduct," and "a unilateral act performed by a person with limited capacity for conduct without the permission of his or her legal representative is invalid" (Article 78 of the same law). Therefore, the woman's marriage contract with the other party is invalid because it has not been consented to by her parents (legal representatives). Legally speaking, this marriage contract is really not firm. However, there is also considerable relief. No. 598,</p>

<p>▲International Private Law Published Dr. Xu Diping, a full-time editor and reviewer at the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, has been studying international private law for many years. In view of the fact that there are few complete and excellent works on international private law in the domestic publishing industry, he has specially written International Private Law. The content of the entire book is divided into three volumes. The first volume is an introduction to the research methods, sources, current situation, and trends of international private law, as well as a detailed description of the legislative overview of various countries. The second volume is a general theory, and the third volume is a famous theory, divided into two parts: legislative conflicts and judicial conflicts. The entire book has more than 200,000 words and is actually a study of: That is, after reaching adulthood, the marriage contract previously entered into can directly take effect due to his or her adulthood; (refer to Article 81 of the same law) Therefore, if the woman can be patient with the other party until she reaches the age of twenty, and then announce the marriage contract, no one can stop it. And during these years, if the woman's parents arbitrarily make another marriage contract for the woman, if the woman "does not agree," she can also legally (Article 972 of the Civil Code) refuse, without having to worry about it.</p>
<p>(2) Human Sentiment Aspects: Judging from the letter, the relationship between the woman and her father must be very perfect; if so, if someone mediates properly, there is definitely hope for a reversal. Since the woman's marriage contract was introduced and entered into by "the director of academic affairs and the Chinese teacher of a certain middle school," the director of academic affairs and the Chinese teacher must have fully agreed to this marriage; can you immediately ask the two teachers to talk to the woman's father? With the status of the two teachers, it seems that they can always gain the woman's father's considerable faith and make him finally agree.</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so Asks: Ms. Jia and Mr. Yi divorced by agreement. Mr. Yi has a son, twelve years old, and Ms. Yi has a daughter, ten years old. The daughter belongs to Ms. Jia, and Mr. Yi is destitute. His son was sent to an orphanage by his relatives. Ms. Jia remarried to Mr. Bing, and her daughter was also taken back to Mr. Bing's home to be raised. However, Ms. Jia knows that Mr. Yi is not easy to recover, and his son will eventually become a beggar. She is concerned about the mother and son and is often worried. Mr. Bing loves Ms. Jia very much. If this son can be raised by Ms. Jia, Mr. Bing will do his best to help with the financial responsibility according to his ability, but if he gains a skill, he will still abandon it. Ms. Jia once wrote to Mr. Yi, but did not receive a reply, which is tantamount to rejection. Mr. Yi is also drifting and has no fixed place to live, so there is no way to contact him. "I don't know whether a divorced mother has the legal right to ask about the upbringing of her son. If she has this right, how should she exercise it? If she does not have this right, are there other ways to complete it?" Answer: According to Article 1051 of the Civil Code;</p>

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the honorary mention of the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica published in your newspaper on the 14th of this month, which stated that the newspaper, upon receiving news from our agency last month, specifically inquired with Mr. Yang Xingfo, the general director of Academia Sinica, for details, we are deeply grateful for your newspaper's attention to this item. However, Mr. Yang Xingfo's reply stated that the matter had already appeared in a dispatch from Paris this spring, and the Academia Sinica was unaware of the specifics, and later received a letter from the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres of the Institut de France on March 5th, only then learning about the matter. It seems necessary to add to this information. The Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres of the Institut de France awarded the Prix Julien to the Institute of History and Philology of the Academia Sinica. The decision was made on March 4th of this year, but the formal announcement was on November 25th. The formal announcement was indeed included in our agency's telegram on November 25th. When the decision was made on March 4th, our agency also sent out a dispatch the next day, reporting on the matter. This is specially communicated for your attention. Respectfully addressed to the Editor of the Shen Bao. From Havas News Agency, December 15th.</p>
<p>"After a divorce by mutual consent, the father shall be responsible for the custody of the children, but if there is a separate agreement, that agreement shall be followed." Now that A and B have divorced by mutual consent, regarding the custody of the children, since there is an agreement, the agreement should be followed according to the law. However, since B is in financial difficulty and unable to support the child, who has been sent to an orphanage, A can certainly demand that B fulfill the obligation to provide support based on Article 1114 of the Civil Code (stating that direct blood relatives have a mutual obligation to provide support) and Article 1117 (stating that those eligible for support are limited to those who cannot maintain their livelihoods and lack the ability to earn a living). Otherwise, A can file a lawsuit in court, because a mother who has been married still cannot have her obligation to support her child extinguished simply because there is a separate agreement regarding custody.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Dingsheng inquires: Our clan has a sacrificial property that has been passed down for over two hundred years, consisting of only three mu of land, managed by A and B in alternating years. Now, B only has one member, who is only engaged in wandering and does not engage in any proper work. Recently, B wants to sell half of the land to someone. (1) This land forms a single plot and has not been divided. Which side belongs to B? (2) If A does not sign, can B sell it alone?</p>
<p>Reply: As described in your letter, the sacrificial property managed by A and B in alternating years is legally called "jointly owned property." According to Article 823 of the Civil Code, each co-owner may request division at any time. The method of division can be determined by agreement. If the land can be divided, it should be equally divided by agreement. If it cannot be divided, then it can only be sold, and the proceeds divided equally. However, if A does not sign, B cannot sell it alone, because according to Article 819 of the Civil Code, the disposal, alteration, and imposition of burdens on jointly owned property must have the consent of all co-owners.</p>

<p>Allocation of funds from the Boxer Indemnity</p>
<h3>Chinese Students Going to England</h3>
<p>(Receiving Industrial Training in England)</p>
<p>According to the "China Press", after the British economic inspection delegation visited China last year and reported back to their country, strongly advocating that for the sake of British trade, the scope of industrial training for Chinese students in England should be expanded. The China Association organized by the British cooperated with the Federation of British Industries to formulate this plan. Recently, the Chinese committees of various universities in London have allocated funds from the Boxer Indemnity specifically for the expenses of Chinese students going to England for industrial training. Therefore, a plan to select and send students has been drafted, and the detailed measures are expected to be announced soon. The joint committee in charge of this matter is particularly concerned with two main aspects: first, carefully selecting suitable students; second, planning for the students' future after returning to China. Therefore, a Sino-British selection committee will be established in Shanghai. The management of students' studies in England will be under the unified management of the Chinese committees of various universities in London, with Mr. Shercock, the secretary of the association, as the director. It is also reported that manufacturers from various industries in England will also participate in this endeavor.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Northwest Specialized Education Preparatory Committee</h3>
<p>Since Dai Chuanxian proposed the development of specialized education in the Northwest, which was approved by the Central Political Council to establish a preparatory committee, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Zhu Jiahua, Chu Minyi, Zhang Ji, Jiao Yitang, Wang Luyi, Wang Yingyu, Yang Hucheng, Shen Pengfei, Xin Shuzhi, and thirteen others have been appointed as preparatory committee members. On the other hand, the Ministry of Education was ordered to be responsible for planning and implementation. The Ministry of Education recently submitted to the Executive Yuan that it is currently necessary to establish a National Northwest Agriculture and Forestry College in Shaanxi Province, and that the Ministry intends to entrust the construction of the Northwest Specialized Education Preparatory Committee to organize a preparatory office responsible for handling the matter, pending central approval. The Northwest Specialized Education Preparatory Committee held its inaugural meeting at the Ministry of Education auditorium from 12:00 to 3:00 PM on the 14th. Yu Youren, Xin Shuzhi, Zhang Ji, Wu Zhihui, Wang Luyi, Shen Pengfei, Dai Chuanxian, Chu Minyi, Cai Yuanpei, Zhu Jiahua, and ten others attended. Dai Chuanxian was elected as the temporary chairman. According to the original draft constitution, one person should be the chairman. However, due to many deferrals during the election, it was decided to establish three standing committee members. Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, and Zhang Ji were elected as standing committee members. Shen Pengfei, the director of the Ministry of Education, was appointed as the chief secretary. The address of the committee will be temporarily located at the Ministry of Education. The articles of association and rules of procedure were generally approved and handed over to the standing committee members for organization. It is planned to hold regular meetings twice a year in June and November, and to convene extraordinary meetings whenever necessary. It is quite difficult for the committee members, who reside in various locations, to gather a large number of people in a short period of time. Currently, with the central committee members concentrated in the capital, it is still necessary to take the opportunity to hold another meeting soon. The issue of funding was also discussed extensively at today's meeting, but a budget has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Japan Revises Elementary School Chinese Textbooks</h3>
<p>(Forcibly Inserting Puppets as Independent Countries... Preventing the Intrusion of Social Thought)</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (China United Press) - The Japanese Ministry of Education has decided to implement revisions to the first volume of the national higher elementary school Chinese textbooks in the early spring of next year. In addition to replacing literary language with colloquial language, the content of the revisions also includes plans to add general information about the puppet state of Manchukuo. The Japanese government intends to incite militarism among ignorant elementary school students by portraying the puppet state as a completely independent country and that it was originally a friendly nation with the Republic of China, attempting to anesthetize young citizens and prevent the intrusion of social thought.</p>

<h3>A Plea for National Middle Schools (1)</h3>
<p>— Liao Maoru</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Government, the middle school curriculum has been revised three times. The first time was in 1929, when the Ministry of Education convened a meeting to formulate provisional curriculum standards, which were promulgated and implemented in August of that year. In 1930, the provisional standards were revised again after deliberation by the Ministry of Education. In August of this year, the Ministry of Education convened another meeting to revise the curriculum standards for senior and junior high schools, setting the number of teaching and self-study hours per week for each subject in each semester for senior and junior high schools, which was approved through deliberation and announced in various newspapers. An official order was issued to the education departments of various provinces and cities to instruct all senior and junior high schools under their jurisdiction to implement the timetable promulgated this time in the next semester. Compared with the subject table and credit table of the provisional standards, there are several major differences: (1) Increased weekly teaching time; (2) Eliminated the separation of arts and sciences; (3) Eliminated elective subjects; (4) Eliminated the credit system. This issue is too important to middle schools, and we must raise several points of practical difficulty and request the Ministry of Education to consider them.</p>
<h3>1. Too Much Weekly Teaching Time</h3>
<p>The school system promulgated in the early Qing Dynasty stipulated 36 hours of teaching per week. In the early years of the Republic of China, not only was the duration of middle school graduation reduced by one year, but the weekly teaching time was also reduced by two or three hours, giving students more opportunities for self-study. This cannot but be said to be a sign of progress. In April of the eighth year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education approved the "adjustment of subjects and time at the discretion of local circumstances" for middle schools. As a result, schools adopted the elective system, stipulating that senior high schools should take 25 credits per semester, which has not changed much until now. The provisional curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education last time also used 26 credits per semester as the standard for senior high schools. The Ministry of Education's advisory document in the eighth year of the Republic truly opened a new era for middle school education in our country. The author has never left middle school administrative life for a single day since the eighth year of the Republic, and has considerable experience to contribute regarding the disputes over the elective system, the advantages and disadvantages of the departmental system, the addition and subtraction of subjects, and the allocation of teaching time. I remember when I was at the East China Normal University High School, we often felt that the students were too busy and said, "You can't have your cake and eat it too. There's no such thing as having both, but school administrators often have such extravagant hopes for students." On the one hand, we want students to read more reference books, do more homework, and visit more places in person. On the other hand, we also want them to exercise more, train their bodies, participate in more extracurricular activities, improve their ability to handle affairs, and develop sound personalities. When I arrived at Guanghua High School, I still had the same feeling, especially for the students in the second and third years of senior high school, none of them didn't say they were busy. But we still forced them to participate in various activities, such as cleaning competitions, current affairs tests, subject tests, group activities, editing special issues, speech contests, ball games, excursions, field trips, research conferences, concerts, sports meets, and teacher-student social gatherings. Because we don't want a young person to come to middle school to become a bookworm and turn into a pretentious, knowledge-stuffed Confucian scholar. However, although students are busy, their interest in their studies is still not weak. If we remove all extracurricular activities and force them to become bookworms, not only will they not study well, but they will also feel that life is dry and monotonous, which will cause inexplicable boredom and unrest. I often think about how we can extract the essentials of middle school teaching materials, concentrate training, reduce students' class time, and increase their practical work, so as to cultivate a large number of young people who are "capable and principled." I have cherished this ideal for many years, but I never thought that the Ministry of Education would go against it and greatly increase the teaching time in middle schools. Putting aside experience, and speaking from the perspective of modern trends, middle schools in the United States are now reducing teaching time, with junior high schools reducing to about 23 hours a week and senior high schools reducing to about 21 hours a week. The current timetable in our country requires junior high schools to have 35-36 hours of classes per week, and senior high schools to have 33-34 hours of classes per week. The gentlemen at the meeting seemed to only care about increasing the time for each subject, without considering the requirements of the times and the abilities of the students. What are the requirements of the times? That is, schools should promote labor, promote extracurricular activities, and promote automatic learning. However, all of these require time. According to that timetable, students can only be busy listening to lectures all day long. Where can they have enough time to study on their own, research, work, or participate in extracurricular activities? Putting aside the facts, and speaking from the discussions of Chinese and foreign educators on education in our country, Mr. Zhuang Zeyan criticized many aspects of modern middle schools in his book "How to Sinicize New Education." He said, "The number of subjects in general middle schools is so large that it makes people who don't know education or are new to school dizzy. Middle school students are truly the darlings of heaven. One moment there is a teacher to talk about geography, the next moment there is a teacher to talk about history, the next moment there is a teacher to talk about physics, the next moment there is a teacher to talk about chemistry... Those who like to listen can listen, and it doesn't matter if they don't listen. After one class, there is a ten-minute break to chat, smoke cigarettes, eat Western pastries..." He advocates that only the essential points of the current curriculum should be retained for teachers to teach, and students should focus on work or investigation. In addition, time should be spent on self-study under the guidance of teachers. This point is quite in line with the author's feelings. Mr. Liang Shuming said in his speech "The Direction of Middle School Transformation in the Future," "Today's students only stand in a passive and receptive position, as if they regard the student era as a short-term preparatory era for life, an era dedicated to reading, thinking that if others prepare everything for them properly, they can concentrate on reading, but the result is completely different. Not only can they not study well and cannot seek knowledge, but they also turn themselves into useless people who cannot do anything. The original intention of education is to cultivate people with skills and abilities. If you want to make a person skilled and capable, you must develop their senses, thoughts, hands, and feet." Therefore, Mr. Liang implemented a method of life education and automatic education in the school. We are very sympathetic to Mr. Liang's words. Recently, the conclusion of the League of Nations special education investigation team's visit to China also said that middle schools have too much teaching time, and many middle schools have too much mental work, which leads to students being irritable and uneasy. There is too little entertainment and outdoor activities, too little close contact between teachers and students, and too little training in group life to bear social responsibility. The method to eliminate this drawback is very simple in foreign countries. We must remember that children should first be treated as children and then as students. Therefore, school life must not only meet the needs of children's minds but also adapt to their multifaceted nature. In terms of implementation, the relationship between teachers and students should not be too serious and too distant. Students should be encouraged to organize various gatherings and manage themselves. Older and capable students should be given appropriate powers so that they have the opportunity to practice maintaining order and handling school affairs. Extracurricular activities occupy an important, sometimes very important, position in school life. Although the methods used in other countries do not necessarily have to be transplanted to China in their entirety, we believe that China will always be able to find a method suitable for China's situation." This passage is very thorough.</p>

<p>III. Teaching Material Outline</p>
<p>(1) The fundamental organization and function of plants, such as cells and tissues;</p>
<p>(2) A discussion of the morphology, structure, and living methods of roots, stems, flowers, fruits, and seeds;</p>
<p>(3) When discussing each part, attention should be paid to anything related to human life. For example, when discussing roots and soil, the meaning of farmland cultivation and fertilization should be shown, as well as the uses of roots, etc. When discussing stems, the importance of forests and the uses of fibers, etc., should be included. When discussing leaves, the source of starch and sugars produced by grains, etc., should be included. When discussing flowers and seeds, the methods and significance of plant breeding, etc., should be included.</p>
<p>(4) Outline of plant classification. This section accounts for about one-quarter of the teaching material and only provides a brief description of the major categories of plants in the order of natural evolution to show the order of development. The plants used as examples for each category should be useful, harmful, and commonly seen plants. Examples are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lower plants... Spirogyra, Volvox, bacteria, Aspergillus, Rhizopus, brewer's yeast, mushrooms, liverwort, moss, ferns, water clover, etc. (2) Higher plants. (A) Agricultural plants... Rice, wheat, millet, sorghum, corn, peach, pear, persimmon, orange, grape, cabbage, mustard greens, water chestnut, spinach, potato, taro, lotus root, arrowhead, sweet potato, radish, eggplant, cucurbits, soybeans, broad beans, or peas, etc. (B) Daily use plants, fibrous raw materials...

(Note) The following points should be noted when compiling teaching materials:</p>
<p>(1) The compilation of teaching materials must be connected and orderly;</p>
<p>(2) Botany in junior high school should pay attention to the fundamental principles of plant life and its relationship with human life everywhere. The selection of materials should not be limited by pure botany;</p>
<p>(3) Plants are whole, and their blessing is also whole. The compilation should be listed separately, but at all times there should be an impression of cooperation between the various parts;</p>
<p>(4) Morphology, structure, and life have a close relationship. When compiling, morphology and living methods should be combined into one, and should not be discussed separately. This method can not only clarify the meaning of morphology, but also increase students' interest.</p>
<p>IV. Summary of Implementation Methods</p>
<p>(1) Homework Requirements</p>
<p>(1) Observation; (2) Experiment; (3) Collection and preparation of specimens; (4) Recording and drawing.</p>

<h3>Second Day of the Public Exhibition Cup International Handball Tournament</h3>
<p>丨Four Doubles Matches Today</p>
<p>(Chinese Team Already Defeated This Week)</p>
<p>(Results of Two Days of Singles: Two to Seven)</p>
<p>In the first week of the First Public Exhibition Cup International Handball Tournament, after two days of singles matches, the Chinese team only saw victory with the first singles player Zhu Kuan and the second singles player Sun Daosheng. The remaining seven groups mostly failed due to unfamiliarity with the terrain or lack of experience. The Western team scored a total of seven points, and the Chinese team scored two points. There are still four doubles matches starting at 6:00 PM today. Even if they win all of them, they will still lose by six to seven. Moreover, there is no complete certainty of winning. Furthermore, defeat is also expected. In any case, hope for this week has been dashed, and we must wait for the second week to seek a way out.</p>
<h3>Results of Last Night's Singles Matches</h3>
<p>Last night, the second singles player, Sun Daosheng, defeated Mr. Ke, the strongest player on the Western team, in two consecutive games, which was truly a surprising performance. Among the remaining three groups, the fifth group match between Cheng Zhenhua was extremely close, but unfortunately, they all suffered defeats, resulting in the Western team winning the first week. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Second Singles Sun Daosheng (China) defeated Ke Lamei (West) 2-0</p>
<p>丨Scores丨21-19, 21-9</p>
<p>Fifth Singles Hei Dade (West) defeated Cheng Zhenhua (China) 2-0</p>

<h3>Situation En Route</h3>
<p>(69 People Start) Sixty-nine athletes from seven schools lined up in front of the Fudan University gate to start. Daxia's Pan Shibao was absent. At 2:30 PM, Zhang Xinfu gave the starting order, and they rushed forward to Xiangyin Road. The first person in the lead was Daxia's Peng Shuxin, followed by Guanghua's Dong Shuzhao and Daxia's Hu Hongji. The last four were Central's Jiang Wensen, Jiang Lianggui, Fudan's Wang Wanchun, and Jiaotong's Zhang Daqi.</p>

<p>(East Sports Association Road) From Xiangyin Road, after passing the Livestock and Planting Company, they turned onto East Sports Association Road. The cinder road caused a large amount of dust and sand to rise. In the middle of East Sports Association Road, Dong Shuzhao had already taken the lead, followed by Jiaotong's Gu Guangfu, Central's Hu Daxuan and Chen Fuqing, and Jinan's Zhou Guangwu and Liu Yibi continued to advance. At the end of East Sports Association Road, Dong Shuzhao still maintained his championship demeanor, while Jinan's Zhou Guangwu and Liu Yibi had surpassed Gu Guangfu and Hu Daxuan, trailing Dong by three yards.</p>
<p>(Passing Jiangwan Road and Returning) After crossing the Shajing Port Bridge and passing the Youlian Film Company, they passed Jiangwan Road and returned west onto West Sports Association Road, heading back towards the Fudan University gate. The corner on Jiangwan Road was the halfway point of the entire course. Dong Shuzhao was still in first place, followed by Zhou Guangwu 40 meters behind. Central's Jiang Wenlin caught up with Liu Yibi and was in third place. The subsequent order was Lu Chongli, Bao Heqing, Hu Dingli, Li Naizhu, Gu Guangfu, Jiang Lianggui, Chen Fuqing, Zhan Yiji, Dai Jianfeng, and Ren Feng.</p>
<p>(Dong Shuzhao First Place) Dong Shuzhao led the entire way and was consistently in first place. Dong Shuzhao was also the first to reach the finish line. Sixty meters behind, the second person to arrive was Jinan's Zhou Guangwu. Liu Yibi overtook Jiang Wensen, who was five meters behind Zhou, and Lu Chongli also caught up, placing fourth. Jiang Wensen fell back to fifth. The others followed in succession until the sixty-eighth person, Xu Zhifeng.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Success and Failure</h3>
<p>(Central) Central's victory lay in the average talent of its team. Although the first person to arrive was only in fifth place, all of the others were within the top twenty.</p>
<p>(Jinan) Jinan's second-place finish was commendable. The first and third place finishers were both from Jinan, and three of the four were within the top twenty. It is a pity that the sixth person did not arrive until the twenty-ninth place.</p>
<p>Guanghua's Dong Shuzhao, first place individually in the Jiangda cross-country race (Photo by Datong)</p>
<p>(Guanghua) Guanghua had been determined to win back the championship after losing it, but yesterday's efforts were still in vain. The first four had very good results, but the last two fell behind to the twenty-seventh and thirty-first places. Guanghua won the individual championship, which can somewhat fulfill its wishes.</p>

<h3>Their Road (II)</h3>
<p>— By 药影H.Barbusse</p>
<p>No matter how the fire started, it quickly and thoroughly devoured the entire house. It concealed everything inside. The efficiency of the buckets was only enough to cool the charred ends of the beams when the roof frame collapsed. Everyone piled the remnants on both sides of the road; in the ashes, only the iron bed frame still retained its human form...</p>
<p>But when the fire broke out, no one bothered to inform the residents of the burned house in Tuolang, nor did anyone notify them afterward.</p>
<p>"They'll find out soon enough," a gossipy woman blurted out.</p>
<p>"Yes," Old Remy echoed with a stifled and monotonous voice, sounding the truth.</p>
<p>As evening approached, bringing back the victims, a sense of emotion filled the village. Many faces, driven by curiosity and fear, peeked out from the dark doorways. Then, everyone gathered in the square, crowded so tightly that not even a messenger could pass... All eyes were fixed on the sky, on the hilltop, like a group of prisoners gathered in the darkness, waiting for a shooting star to appear.</p>
<p>"Look, they're over there!" Gaspar hissed quietly.</p>
<p>"It's impossible!" Two women, overwhelmed by fear, exclaimed in unison.</p>
<p>In the distance, on the red hills, they appeared together. Suddenly, everyone realized they were unaware of their disaster. They were still walking towards that vast open space, the space where their burned house once stood, with their usual calm steps.</p>
<p>The onlookers standing below became restless. The condemned couple, though walking towards the punishment prepared for them by fate, were still talking, and despite being so close, they saw nothing. Their minds were entirely focused on each other; they had become detached from the world.</p>
<p>They drew nearer… nearer… Suddenly, they raised their heads, looking ahead…</p>
<p>"Ah!" A beggar, allowed to participate in this event for the sake of charity, sighed.</p>
<p>But even then, they still saw nothing. Undoubtedly, their thoughts, like their face-to-face conversation, were completely concentrated on each other… They smiled with exactly the same smile. Could anyone see or guess at this smile? "That adds a beautiful, pitiful, dim vortex to the human face?" Whether visible or not, everyone thought so.</p>
<p>After a while, the man and woman carelessly passed between the two piles of burned debris: they continued walking, unable to recognize what lay at their feet; they disappeared on the other side, on the side where the sun rises.</p>
<p>The faces of the onlookers showed horror and bewilderment, as they speculated in the dim light.</p>
<p>Even though Aiete, the woman, had a stomach full of words, these words were too simple for her to express; she only moved her lips. But as soon as she did, old Remy calmly responded with a "Yes"...</p>
<p>…Yes… Yes… Everyone thought so. Yes, obviously… They were "elsewhere," so they saw nothing… Yes, their road stretched out clearly before them, they continued walking, and that was it. Yes, they were not stopped by their house; that was only natural, because their house was no longer there…</p>
<p>Note: The author, Henri Barbusse, is a world-renowned writer like Romain Rolland. Born in 1873, he began his literary activities in his youth, with poetry collections such as "The Weepers" (Ｐleureuses) and novels such as "Hell" (Enfer). However, it was not until the publication of his novel "Fire" (Lefeu) during the European War, which depicted the horrors of war, that he occupied an important position in the world literary scene. This piece is translated from his earliest collection of short stories, "We Others" (Nousartre).</p>
<h3>"Gambling" Education</h3>
<p>— By 星子</p>
<p>In yesterday's newspaper, there were two reports about "gambling." One was about a cook who committed theft and was imprisoned for gambling on lottery tickets. In prison, he still muttered the names of lottery tickets such as "Wang Zhigao" and "Li Yuebao," and frequently asked people what the lottery numbers were for the day. The other was about a rickshaw puller who pawned his rickshaw and his wife's laundry for a final gamble, ultimately losing everything, resulting in the tragic deaths of the husband hanging himself and the wife poisoning herself. These two tragic scenes about "gambling" are common occurrences in Shanghai. But precisely because they have become "common occurrences" that are ignored by the general public, we feel that these "common occurrences" contain extremely serious social implications.</p>
<p>Originally, the backwardness of education in our country is undeniable. However, the education about "gambling" is extremely developed, and its design and teaching methods are extremely persuasive. Taking Shanghai as an example, when a child in Shanghai reaches the age of six or seven, there are often street vendors selling sweets waiting for him at the entrance of the alley. Mothers can take their children at any time to learn the preliminary knowledge of gambling and tell them how to win a piece of candy with a smile. As the child grows older, to nine or ten years old, this kind of infantile education is naturally no longer appropriate. Therefore, there are already stalls for dice games at the entrance of the alley waiting. The child can also ask his mother for a few copper coins at any time to experience the taste of drinking and gambling. If the father and mother entertain guests with mahjong, then the child can further gain a very correct concept and interest in gambling from the factual lessons of his father and mother. When the child grows a little older, on the roads around the Great World and Dongxin Bridge, there are friends wearing short clothes waving various gambling tools in their hands to beckon people, and every game field is also equipped with special seats for gambling, where you can try your luck at any time. As for adults, there are even more specialized schools about gambling, including racetracks, dog racing tracks, jai alai, and roulette casinos. The City God Temple is filled with mahjong tiles and dominoes, and small cigarette paper shops are frequently plastered with lottery tickets. The magic hand of "chance" firmly grips everyone, and as soon as you slip, you can be thrown into the tragic deep pit of "husband hanging himself, wife poisoning herself."</p>
<p>If this kind of "gambling education" is allowed to develop in this way, then the tragedies of "hanging oneself and poisoning oneself" will forever be regarded as "common occurrences." However, is this really a "common occurrence"?</p>
<h3>Winter Suburbs</h3>
<p>— By 司晨</p>
<p>In the suburbs, one side of the pond bank is fields, and the other side is water. The water is so low that the sails of the boats moving along are level with the bank. The fields are so scattered, with puddles and irregular mounds of graves interspersed among them.</p>
<p>It's just past the halfway point of the afternoon, and the sun is already hurrying westward. And it's hurrying so quickly, as we can see from the gradual lengthening of the shadows of the passing boat sails.</p>
<p>With the wind, the sails are raised, and one or two people tow the boat with a rope. Those on the boat can do other chores in the sunlight. Those on the shore can also feel quite comfortable walking on the soft, wool-like withered grass.</p>
<p>Seeing these spreading, weak wild grasses that have come all the way from the fields to the pond bank, one feels a childlike curiosity. There's nothing much in the fields, so let's set a fire and burn them. It really catches fire, so quickly. The flames don't look very big in the sunlight, but the white smoke billows high enough.</p>
<p>The water chestnut fields have turned into puddles, and some remaining trunks lie askew. Someone is feeling for snails in another larger puddle. Still others are hunched over, digging for water chestnuts in the muddy fields.</p>
<p>There is one very large puddle, perhaps we can call it a swamp, with flocks of ducks swimming in the water, probing their heads into the water to find food. The scene is very lively. Suddenly, the duck herder calls out loudly from the edge of the field, and the ducks start to call out loudly as if they had received an order. There must be more than five hundred of them. They climb onto the field ridge while calling out. It's so interesting to see them crowding together so tightly when they eat!</p>
<p>Gradually, night is approaching. The sun suddenly sinks below the horizon, and only a few piles of red clouds remain on the horizon. The pale image of the cold moon has been carved into the sky, and the evening crows are cawing as they search for their old homes in the twilight.</p>
<h3>Discussion on "Conditions for Love"</h3>
<p>— Zhong Jie</p>
<p>"Love has conditions," this is a principle that no one can deny. Otherwise, everyone could love anyone, everyone would be lovable, which would simply be equivalent to the promiscuity of primitive times, and there would be no "love" to speak of!</p>
<p>But what are the conditions for love? That is, what is the standard for love? Regarding this question, Ms. Wei Ji already provided an answer in a discussion on the 13th of this month. The standards she proposed were profound knowledge, noble morality, shared thoughts, upward aspirations, strong willpower, special talents, strong physique, considerable age, and gentle temperament. As for money and beauty, Ms. Wei Ji believes that they are base and vulgar and should not be included as conditions. It is very obvious that Ms. Wei Ji's view is not very correct, because if all 1.6 billion people in the world were to choose a spouse according to Ms. Wei Ji's conditions, then at least 1.5 billion people would never find their match!</p>
<p>We believe that there are only two words for the conditions of love, that is, "suitable" or "fitting". Whether in terms of material or spiritual aspects, external or internal qualities, it must be, and only needs to be, "mutually suitable". Whether it is knowledge, talent, temperament, physique, age... as well as the wealth and appearance that Ms. Wei Ji considers base, they must also be suitable. Of course, the "suitability" mentioned here will never be "absolutely suitable", but only "suitably suitable". If all conditions are "suitable", and there is still a slight difference in one condition, then I think it is also fine, because we believe that nothing in the world is "perfect" or "completely good."</p>
<p>Property, of course, should also be listed as one of the conditions. We don't need to "overcorrect"; nor can we leave reality and engage in empty talk. In a capitalist society, before it collapses, no one can transcend the power of money. No matter how you say it, love is pure, great, and beyond everything, but the material environment of society actually dominates all human actions and thoughts. The philosopher Karl once said: "The material environment of society dominates human consciousness; it is not human consciousness that dominates the material environment of society." Love should also stand on a materialist standpoint and should not seek a basis in stale idealism.</p>
<p>But we are not advocating that "the richer the property, the more it meets our ideal conditions." We only advocate "suitability". In short: we advocate that everything has a balanced suitability, talent, knowledge, insight, thought, ambition, age, wealth, and appearance can all be suitable. This is the real condition for love.</p>
<p>If Ms. Wei Ji is a woman with profound knowledge, noble morality, strong willpower, special talents, and gentle temperament, then I fully agree with her opinion, because such a perfect woman should have a man with corresponding conditions as a partner. If Ms. Wei Ji is not as I imagined in my ideal, then she would be "demanding of others with Zhou's strictness and lenient with oneself"! However, this is not within the scope of the question.</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of the Times and Love Sixteen</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he had drunk one too many cups of coffee in the Russian restaurant, Haiquan lay in bed and couldn't fall asleep no matter what. After a while, he heard a burst of laughter from downstairs.</p>
<p>'Could those Japanese devils be laughing at me?'</p>
<p>So he became even more resentful of Mrs. Tsuruko.</p>
<p>When he woke up, there seemed to be some sunlight coming through the window. He raised himself up halfway and looked outside. Sure enough, the sky was very clear this morning. He quickly got up, put on his clothes, and went down to the second floor, intending to go to the bathroom to wash up. But when he reached the bathroom door, he saw that the door was tightly closed from the inside.</p>
<p>'Who is it?'</p>
<p>His voice was a bit sharp. But there was no reply from inside. After a while, he suddenly heard a series of coughing sounds from inside.</p>
<p>'Who is it?'</p>
<p>His voice was even louder. At the same time, he thought, this is really outrageous. Could it be that Mr. Zeng came back last night?</p>
<p>'Excuse me, Mr. Lin, please wait a moment. I'm really sorry.'</p>
<p>Mrs. Tsuruko, still wearing her pajamas, stretched her upper body out from her bedroom, rubbing her eyes and nodding to him with a smile. Her voice was even softer than usual, and her attitude was as if to say, 'This is unavoidable, please forgive me this time.'</p>
<p>He thought, could it be that she really dared to leave that Japanese man to stay in this house last night? If that were the case, then that would be truly outrageous! He was about to question her when he suddenly saw a young girl standing behind Mrs. Tsuruko, wearing a Japanese-style dress, with her hair draped over her shoulders. A pair of pure black pupils stared intently at Haiquan. He had never seen such a beautiful girl. The girl's complexion was so white, like the mid-autumn moon. Her attire was also very fashionable, like a cloud of colorful clouds. Haiquan was dazzled and speechless for a moment. Glancing at the beautiful Japanese girl, he quickly suppressed the angry expression on his face, put on a serious expression, and went back up to the third floor.</p>
<p>He sorted out the books he would use today and then planned to go downstairs to the bathroom to relieve himself. As soon as he stepped out of the room, he saw a bald Japanese man, about fifty years old, walking up the stairs step by step, wearing a kimono, a Japanese-style robe. Haiquan recognized that it was the Japanese clothing that Mr. Zeng often wore at home. How could this Japanese man be so bold, acting as the owner of this house? He really wanted to go forward and punch him. But he was afraid of causing trouble, so he had to endure it. He saw that when the Japanese man reached his door, he bowed to him very humbly. This attitude moved Haiquan. Haiquan also quickly returned a bow.</p>
<p>After washing up, when he returned to his room, he saw a porcelain plate on his table with four slices of toast and a cup of hot milk. In the past, Mrs. Tsuruko would accompany him to breakfast every morning. Why did she specially send his portion here today? He couldn't figure out the reason and was feeling unhappy.</p>
<h3>Expectation</h3>
<p>— Lu Wei</p>
<p>It's dusk, and the mist is hazy.</p>
<p>I walked out of the West Gate alone, crossed a street full of cow dung and pig dung, and with light steps and a melancholy mood, I soon arrived in the maple forest.</p>
<p>The maple forest was full of blood-red maple leaves, and the evening breeze blew gently, making a rustling sound. All the crops in the fields have been harvested. I sat down on a stone. My expectant mood was very urgent. I had made an appointment with him, and he was coming to the maple forest at dusk. I was waiting for him.</p>
<p>Slowly, many stories of my childhood playing in this maple forest were evoked in my memory. The friends who played with me at that time are now scattered. Because of the oppression of life, who can permanently hold on to the joy and carefree mood of youth? I often sit alone in the maple forest and think, and sadness always surrounds my heart.</p>
<p>This evening, I made an appointment with him to come to this maple forest to see me. I don't know if he can come, but how much I miss him! I hope he comes, I have something to say to him.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and the shadows in the maple forest gradually expanded.</p>
<p>My heart became bitter, he's not coming! I thought like this.</p>
<p>The sky is dark. I have to go home. I can't wait any longer. I sighed in disappointment, picked up a red maple leaf, and wrote on it with a steel pen: "This is a drifting heart." I took it home.</p>
<p>When I got home, my mother asked me earnestly:</p>
<p>"Where have you been? We were so worried waiting for you!"</p>
<p>I had nothing to say. I only ate half a bowl of rice for dinner and felt like I was going to vomit something.</p>
<h3>Fighting</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Speaking of fighting, friends like A Q will definitely stick out their tongues, from which it can be seen that fighting is not a fun thing, but there are also people like Li Kui, who are full of energy when fighting is mentioned. Such people will inevitably damage the gentleman's style. A "gentleman" is "a person who is gentle and refined," and everyone is willing to be a gentleman, so everyone has to reluctantly put on a gentle and refined appearance.</p>
<p>China has few people like Li Kui, but many people like A Q, so China is still a country of gentlemen. However, people like A Q are not completely useless. When you are preparing to beat him, he can be magnanimous and indifferent. Even if you spit in his face, he will smile and wipe it off with his sleeve, and apologize to you. But if you are still unwilling and actually give him two slaps on the face, then he has no choice but to scold you, "Damn it," and quickly step back three steps, touch his face; but he will still say with a smiling face: "Gentlemen use words, villains use fists. Why did you hit someone?" Of course, he is much better than you, because he is actually a gentleman. Afterwards, if you are still willing to be a villain, rush forward, full of murderous intent, and must beat him so that he can't get up from the ground, at this time, he seems to really have no way to endure it, immediately retreat three steps again, scold from your mother all the way to three generations of ancestors, roll up his sleeves, pull up his heels, and seem to immediately aim his head at your chest. But the enemy is still coming fiercely, and the situation is obviously not very good; so he immediately realizes that "a brave man does not suffer immediate losses," and changes his mind, preparing for "long-term resistance," and shouts loudly with all his strength: "I'm not fighting you now, wait for me tomorrow!" In this way, he runs away without a trace.</p>
<p>Therefore, China will not perish, because there are indeed many such people.</p>
<h3>The Measurement of the Depth of the Sea</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Everyone knows that in order to ensure the safety of navigation, the depth of the sea must be measured precisely.</p>
<p>In the past, the simple measurement method was to use a long rope, with a hammer tied at the bottom, vertically into the sea. After the hammer touched the seabed, the length of the rope was calculated. This method is still used today. At the bottom of the hammer, a hollow hole is often carved, filled with animal oil, so that the soil quality of the seabed can be known by the shells or sand attached to the bottom of the hammer.</p>
<p>However, if the ocean is too deep, such as to thousands of meters, then the time when the hammer touches the seabed is not easy to know, and because the seawater pressure is too high, a large hammer must be used, and the rope must also be thick, so when it is pulled out of the water, the weight is increased due to the resistance of the water, which is indeed a very troublesome matter. Therefore, two types of electric depth sounders and echo sounders are now mostly used.</p>
<p>On the weight of the electric depth sounder, there is a thin glass tube two feet long, installed in a protective brass tube. The glass tube is coated with red Chromium silver acid. In proportion to the pressure of seawater, the part immersed in seawater will turn white, so by calculating the division of this white Chromium silver acid, the depth of the ocean can be known.</p>
<p>The echo sounder, in addition to the disadvantage of not knowing the soil quality of the seabed, can measure precisely and easily for weather and the speed of the ship. The principle is very simple, that is, from the time it takes for the sound waves emitted from the water surface to reach the seabed and then echo back to the water surface, the depth of the water can be known. The speed of sound waves in seawater is about 1,500 meters per second, then the deep sea of 10,000 meters can be measured in a few seconds.</p>

<h3>Complex Process of Financial and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>丨Difference of Eight Taels and a Half, Increase of Two Taels and Four丨</p>
<p>(Anticipatory swap, the shorts posted about two taels) Yesterday, the market rebounded again, and the overall trend was complicated and very volatile. However, the difference was only two taels. The daily high and low differed by eight taels and five qian. In the end, the market rose by two taels and four qian. Because of the swap period, both the long and short sides were uncertain. The market immediately fell after opening, because the silver market fell in England and was flat in the United States, and the market price of the silver exchange rose again. The exchange rate was still rising, so the impact was only good for foreign exchange, and it immediately became firm. There was no immediate response to the bills. The recipients also moved to see a sudden sale. It fell from eight hundred and eleven taels to zero five taels. Afterwards, the buyers seemed to be active again. The US dollar bank had a good appetite, but the intentions of the industry were different, causing the price to fluctuate. In the early market, there were anticipatory swaps, but the premium was still low, and the price fell. Then, the foreign exchange rose sharply, and the demand was constant, so the price soared by more than eight taels, and the market was extremely sharp. In the end, it reached eight hundred and twelve taels. All the December contracts were transferred by the shorts from Xingxiang to Qianchangxiang in January by more than one hundred, which was a discount of five qian, because there was an abundance of spot goods. Also, the January swap to February was opened in advance in the afternoon. Initially, it was around two taels. Then it was raised to two taels and five or six qian. Later, because the shorts held on, it welcomed one tael and two qian, and then added to about two taels inside and outside, all posted by the shorts. The transaction details of each firm are not clear, but the Guangbang Hengxing did not swap. It is roughly based on today (16th)'s suspended brand as the standard for the transaction. The daily situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>(Many small fluctuations in the morning market) The January contract immediately fell by one tael and five qian to eight hundred and eight taels at the opening in the early morning. Then there were ups and downs of seven or eight qian. Although the large amount was reduced, it did not improve. It was actually because the US silver rose and the private telegram added one-sixteenth, so it fell from eight taels and six qian to seven taels and eight qian. Suddenly, it turned higher. Hengyu, Hengchang, Yongyi, Fengyong, Hongli, Qingfa, Yongshunli, Wanxing, Yuantai, etc. entered the market to compete for purchase, and Huabi first absorbed three-month US dollars 125 and Macali advanced one-month English gold 4375. The price jumped up by more than three taels. There was only a few qian of return. At 9:30, it was eleven taels and two qian. Only HSBC's list did not change except for the French franc plus two yuan. The internal stability, Citibank absorbed one-month US dollars 9375 and advanced English gold 3125. Afterwards, HSBC came out with three-month US dollars 125, and Fuyu, Hengyu, Fuchang, Yifeng, Yongqian, Changxiang, Yuanchun, Bingxing, etc. took the opportunity to sell, and it immediately dropped by more than six taels, like a waterfall. At 9:50, it was zero five taels. Huabi absorbed another three-month US dollars 1875, and this month's 9375 in and out were all done by Hengchang, Yongqingfa, Yongyiyu, Hengxing, Fuyu, Futai, Hengyuantai, etc. who came to buy, and it pulled up more than three taels again. At 10:30, it was zero eight taels and seven qian. In the meantime, the ups and downs were no more than one tael. Later, it was sold by Zhaofeng Chang, Yuanmao Yong and retail investors. At nearly 11 o'clock, it was zero six taels. Because the shorts entered slightly, Citibank absorbed one-month US dollars twenty-eight yuan, and the wheat line absorbed three-month English gold half a penny. At 11:30, it was zero seven taels and eight qian. After that, the situation gradually declined and the transaction was not sensitive, so it retreated to zero five taels and eight qian and saw zero six taels and six qian again. Near the closing, Yuanxing Yong sold again for zero five taels and nine qian. Then it closed at zero six taels and three qian.</p>
<p>(The after-market reached eight hundred and twelve taels) The after-market opened at zero five taels and six qian. Then it went from zero six taels to zero three taels and a half, because the January to February swap transactions had already started in the market. The longs posted two taels to one tael and eight qian and then from two taels and a half to one tael and zero. Yuanchun, Yuankangxiang, Hengyu, Yongfeng, etc. all came out, and Huabi also came out with one-month English gold 4375. Then Huabi absorbed three-month US dollars 1875, one-month twenty-eight yuan, and Fuyu, Zhifengyong, etc. came to buy. At 2:20, it was zero six taels and four qian and then fell back two taels. Qianchangxiang and retail investors sold out. After 2:45, it gradually rose, and the exchange rate also turned better. Citibank absorbed English gold December 375, and HSBC absorbed February US dollars twenty-eight yuan. There was no large amount of transactions on the table. The price fluctuated by one or two taels. After 3:30, it felt more lively. December US dollars were doing against 875. Hengxing, Fuyu, Fuchang, etc. bought. At nearly 4 o'clock, it was zero five taels and one qian, slightly less than eight or nine qian. After 4 o'clock, the buying was even stronger. Zhifengyong, Daxingyong, Yongfuyu, Zhaofengchang, and items were all making progress. There were also sporadic shorts to resist. The December US dollars sold by Shanghai to Huabi were only calculated at 75, and the market price rose by three or four taels. At 4:20 (actually exceeding the maximum price in the morning), it reached twelve taels. Then it closed at 4:30 at eleven taels and nine qian, a rebound of two taels and four qian compared to the previous day. Zhifengyong then vomited it out again, so it went back to below eleven taels. According to the whole day, the maximum was twelve taels and the minimum was zero three taels and five qian, with a difference of eight taels and five qian. The bare strip only added two and a half to nine taels.</p>

Afterwards, sixty-eight taels returned to sixty-four and five taels. The noon closing was sixty-seven taels. In the afternoon, it was sixty-seven taels to more than sixty-nine taels. In the end, it was sixty-one taels, a press of two taels less than the previous day. There was a double closing price before and after the account, zero seven taels zero six taels in the morning, and thirteen taels to twelve taels in the afternoon. The water replenishment was zero four taels and ten taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(The amount of swaps in and out is small recently) The transactions on the table were very busy.

Qianchangxiang, Dadecheng, Yifengyong, Yuanfengyong, Fuchang, Daxingyong, Yuanmaoyong all withdrew, Hengyu, Fuyu, Yuanmao, Jihe, etc. came out and in, Bing and out about two hundred. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong, Yuantai, Fuchang, Daxingyong, Fuyu, Hengchangyong advanced, Qianchangxiang, Wanxing, Yuanchun, Dadecheng, Yongfeng all finished, Hengyu's in and out were still tight, and the Dalian gang had about 1,200 to 1,300.

<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Continuous Rise in the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>(Limited trading, no price limits for covering short positions)</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to rise, with a clear bullish sentiment supported by the rising price of American cotton. Market sentiment reached a peak, and actual sales also followed. Many short sellers rushed to cover their positions, with limited trading and no price limits. The rise in the first trading session was very sharp, while the second and third sessions were flat. However, according to a partial investigation in the afternoon, most of the spot yarn purchased by the customer groups contained speculative elements. Due to financial considerations, factories were hedging in distant months. The future trend will still be based on demand.</p>
<h3>Human Labels Continue to Improve, Up 5 to 9 Qian</h3>
<p>The human label market opened with rising American cotton prices and a lack of sellers. The market became increasingly tight, with near-month contracts rising by 1.7 or 1.8 qian and distant-month contracts rising by 9 qian to 1 liang.

<h3>Cotton Market Continues to Advance Higher</h3>
<p>(Speculators are particularly keen to go long)</p>
<p>The upward trend in the cotton market is becoming increasingly intense due to the rise in American cotton prices. This has led to a strong bullish sentiment among speculators, and purchases are increasing daily, further fueling the upward trend. However, one manufacturer continues to short sell, adding 20,000 dan to their positions. Ningbo groups have closed out many long positions amid the rising prices. The need for spot goods from various factories in the market remains flat.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to foreign merchants selling, but later strengthened due to the strength of Wall Street and the covering of short positions in Pudong. Futures rose by 23 to 26 points, and spot prices rose by 30 points. British cotton futures fell by 12 points, and spot prices fell by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 2 points. Indian cotton was purchased by Japanese merchants, and the market was stable. Pingguoer rose by 2.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 3 rupees, and Bairuoxi rose by 2.25 rupees.

<h3>Second Estimated Report on National Cotton Production in the 21st Year</h3>
<p>(Decrease of 2,734,299 dan compared to the first estimate)</p>
<p>The China Cotton Statistics Association announced the second estimate of national cotton production for the 21st year at 5:00 PM on December 15th of the 21st year as follows:</p>
<p>(Cotton Field Area: 37,079,835 mu)</p>
<p>(Ginned Cotton Production: 8,094,863 dan)</p>
<p>The above estimates are based on reports from: 1) Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, eleven provinces, and the two municipalities of Tianjin and Shanghai; 2) The cotton crop conditions before December 10th; 3) The losses from disasters suffered by cotton crops in various provinces before December 10th have already been included; 4) Cotton fields are measured in mu, and cotton production is measured in dan.</p>
<p>The comparison of the two estimates for this year with the cotton field production of previous years is shown below:</p>
<p>|Year|Cotton Field Area|Ginned Cotton Production|</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>|8|33,037,881|9,028,390|</p>
<p>|9|28,307,290|6,750,403|</p>

<p>|20 First Estimate|35,468,352|8,793,241|</p>
<p>|Second Estimate|34,182,747|6,460,641|</p>
<p>|Final Revision|31,637,779|6,399,780|</p>
<p>|21 First Estimate|37,086,775|10,829,162|</p>
<p>|Second Estimate|37,079,835|8,094,863|</p>
<p>This year's cotton production, according to the Association's first estimate, reached 10,829,162 dan, the largest production in recent years. This was mainly because the Yellow River basin, which is prone to drought, received sufficient rainfall this year, and the cotton fields developed extremely well. The yield per mu exceeded 100 jin. Although the south suffered from heavy rain and cold, conditions were generally good. Therefore, the national average yield was 30 jin of ginned cotton per mu (equivalent to 100 jin of seed cotton). The collection of 100 jin of cotton from 100 jin of seed cotton is only considered a normal harvest, and it is rare for the national average to achieve a normal harvest. After the first estimate was released, the climate in the cotton-growing areas gradually deteriorated, contrary to the past. In the north, rainfall went from appropriate to excessive, and river water overflowed. Many cotton fields in Hebei, Shandong, and Shanxi were flooded, and early frost further damaged the cotton harvest. At that time, the south was experiencing drought. This phenomenon already existed during the first estimate. Rainfall remained scarce in August and September. Autumn typhoons, which are common in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, fortunately did not occur this year, but the drought caused boll shedding, which also had a significant impact on the cotton harvest. Therefore, before the first estimate in August, the weather conditions in the cotton-growing areas of both the north and south were good, but after the estimate, the situation changed to the opposite, leading to a gradual decline in the expected normal cotton harvest, especially in Hubei, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Hubei was also facing bandit suppression, which had a considerable impact. The only province with relatively good conditions was Jiangsu, but the increase was minimal. Overall, the second estimate was significantly lower than the first estimate. Hubei decreased by two-fifths, and Shandong decreased by one-third. Jiangsu was the only province with an increase, but the increase was very small. The overall national cotton production decreased by 2,734,299 dan compared to the first estimate, a decrease of 25%. The quality also slightly deteriorated. Due to the heavy rainfall in the north during the peak boll-forming period, the cotton production in the northern provinces, which rarely had yellow stains, greatly increased this year. Shandong and Hebei experienced particularly early frost, and "frost yellow," which is commonly referred to in the cotton industry, was also prevalent. In the south, the prolonged drought and scarce rainfall during the boll-opening period prevented the cotton fruits from developing fully, and there were also quite a few immature fibers. Therefore, the quality of national cotton production was also inferior. (The rest is omitted)</p>

<h3>Rice Market Eases with Clear Weather</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, goods arrived from the Yangtze River, numbering in the thirties and forties, but sales in this street were sluggish. Thick japonica rice prices weakened due to news from Changzhou and Wuxi that market prices were softening, and the price was cheaper than that of Shenhua rice. However, Kunshan rice remained stable. Buyers saw a surge in goods and poor sales, and opening prices decreased by 0.2 yuan. Late rice purchases by brokers neared 1,000 dan, and prices were similar to the previous day. The supply of Du Yang tip rice also decreased, and transactions suddenly slowed, with prices fluctuating slightly. There was still a large supply of early rice, but there were no transactions, and prices were at 0.2 yuan. Rice from Suzhou and Tongxiang arrived steadily, and the market saw no fluctuations (Xinzha). Yesterday, more than 40 boats arrived. Transactions of country rice were the most common, and market conditions were stable. No one inquired about Changdai northern japonica rice and Kunshan rice. The price of Danyang Jiangyin rice had to fall. Sales of Zishan Qingjing early rice were particularly sluggish, with prices slightly below normal. Customer groups made few purchases of the Du tip rice, and prices remained stable. The price of Bianyin Yuan was dragged down slightly by the thick japonica rice.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Machine Yuan Rice Suddenly Rises by 0.3 Yuan</h3>
<p>(Speculators Purchase Rice from Jiangxi and Hunan)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation for customer sen rice was quite good, and the price of customer yuan rice especially showed improvement. Speculators inquired about customer sen rice, and the appetite was strong. The daily secret agreement has reached over 10,000 dan, and purchases were made in production areas such as Jiujiang. Areas such as Changsha, Hunan, Xiangpiao, and Yisuhe were particularly closely watched by speculators. It is said that the local rice industry has mostly been explored by customers in Shanghai and Nanjing. The amount has been estimated at 70,000 to 80,000 bags, so the local production price is high, and it will be difficult to transport from there in the future. Yesterday, speculators in this city also purchased 970 bags of Jiangxi machine rice, with prices ranging from 8.25 yuan to 8.35 yuan, which is 0.1 yuan higher than the previous day. Northern ocean rice is temporarily difficult to transport due to the difficulty in loading rice from the lower reaches of the river, and they also tried to purchase more than 100 bags of Hunan machine red rice in the market at a price of 8 yuan to 7.9 yuan. Recently, customer yuan rice has been thoroughly searched in the district, but it has not been successful. Yesterday, 400 bags of newly arrived Wuhu machine yuan rice were immediately purchased by the district gang, and the price suddenly rose by as much as 0.3 yuan, with prices ranging from 9.3 yuan, 9.25 yuan, to 9 yuan or more. In the future, customers and speculators all have intentions to facilitate purchases, and the market should be able to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Strong Selling in the Distant-Month Flour Market</h3>
<p>(Five More Ships of Han Wheat Scattered Warehouse Goods Are Agreed Upon)</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of various months tended to stabilize again. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly lower by 0.1 jiao in Canada and higher by 4 or 5 cents in Chicago, the exchange rate was difficult to lower, and the outside market was mostly floating. Given the liveliness of the spot market, buying was very active. Although various factories had sales, they were still unable to satisfy demand, so the prices of various months were better by 7.5 li to 1 cent compared to the previous day. By the opening of the afternoon market, March had been urgently covering shorts, and the atmosphere was very good. Distant months also saw an increase due to the absorption of the Lian Gang. However, after 2 o'clock, they fell back again. A large batch of Australian warehouse goods was sold, totaling five ships, with a low price of 3.235 yuan. Gang Xin agreed to three ships, Fufeng agreed to one ship, and Xinda and others jointly agreed to one ship. Therefore, there were large-scale sales in various distant-month markets, and the quantity was substantial. However, the near-term market remained the same. The reason for this is that the near-term market is not active, and the distant-term market is difficult to sell. As a result, this month was down 0.25 li compared to the previous day, January was down 0.25 li, February was down 1.25 li, March was down 1.5 li, April was down 0.75 li, and May was down 1 li.</p>
<h3>No Vitality in the Wheat Futures Market</h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat futures market yesterday morning and afternoon, the market generally showed a revolving image. With the quoted price of foreign wheat, there were few ups and downs. The selling side cannot be active without foreign wheat chips. The storage of local wheat in various places is really sparse, and the small amount of arrivals is conceivable. All sellers are not willing to say so if they do not have a real grasp, so trading is always sluggish and lifeless. Yesterday, only the first month was down by a small amount of 2 or 3 points at the beginning, and then rebounded. The remaining months had very few ups and downs. As a result, January was better by 1 point compared to the previous day, and the rest had no difference.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>New Tide Green Seen Looser in Later Market</h3>
<p>(Coarse Sand White Sugar Withholding Not Yet Opened)</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market turned weaker due to the decline in the target price. The association plans to allocate and coarse sand white output households still call for 15.5 liang, and the input households get 15.4 liang, with a difference of one yuan, resulting in a withholding situation. 20th grade medium sand white goods are in short supply. The 18th grade medium white is 14.35 liang, which is five yuan less than the gang. The 80th and 90th grade Dutch red remain stable. A batch of new tide greens that arrived the other day has already been cleared for exchange yesterday, with a total of over 1,200 bags delivered. The price of Tizhuang green is still half a liang, followed by 9.4 yuan to 9.1 yuan, and then 8.9 yuan. There is a tendency for the market to weaken, because the new tide has just been found out, and there will inevitably be more goods arriving in the later period, and the number of points will inevitably fall. It is also expected.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday, I received overseas telecommunications, New York spot and December sugar prices unchanged. January, March, and May are slightly three pounds down, July and September are slightly one pound down, London December is slightly two and a half pence, March and May are slightly two and a quarter pence, and Java white sugar is unchanged and still sells for eight shillings and three pence.</p>
<p>Silk Tea</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Presents a Stagnant Appearance</h3>
<p>The silk market's American price slightly decreased by one or two cents, while the Japanese price remained the same. The price of silk in the producing area remained tight as before, and transactions gradually decreased, and the market reversed to a stagnant image. What's more, sales have been slow for the past ten days, and the number of packages sold has reached more than 3,000. All those with goods are reluctant to let go, and they must wait for a higher price before selling.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>Sixth Branch Road Sheet Iron New Goods Arrive</h3>
<p>(More Than 400 Bundles of Eastern White Iron Arrive)</p>
<p>The Sixth Branch Road sheet iron that has been in short supply for many days arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf yesterday with 4,618 rolls. It is heard that Yihuo Packaging Factory has 1,000 rolls, and the rest are orders from various industry colleagues. It is heard that the current market price is 7.75 liang, which is slightly softer by 0.25 liang than before. A certain store in Hankou has already delivered 600 rolls.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 400 dan of 6-foot and 7-foot Eastern Ocean white iron arrived at the Huishan Wharf.</p>
<p>Coal</p>
<h3>Jiaozhou Coal Transactions Are Very Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiaozhou screened lump coal had very active transactions, with a total of more than 230 tons traded. The price of money rose by 2.5 yuan for this reason. The transactions of the remaining coal seams were also numerous, mostly for Chonghe coal balls, and the price also rose slightly.</p>

<p>Random Notes</p>
<h3>Locomotive Starts Automatically</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>According to reports yesterday, a strange event occurred on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway on the 4th of this month: a locomotive started automatically from Guangzhou towards Foshan without a driver. Some say that it was because the locomotive had too much firepower, and the steam hose on the engine was not tightly secured, and was forced open by the steam power, so it could start automatically without a driver. This is also a "presumptive" explanation, and may not necessarily be the case, because since the advent of trains, there has never been such a special situation.</p>
<p>Recently, strange and bizarre things in our country have been emerging one after another. Last year the Yellow River cleared, this year the Yellow River narrowed, and countless antiques and food were unearthed. Also, in some places, the "eye of heaven" opened, and in other places, monsters appeared. Although such events have been occasionally recorded in history, no one has ever witnessed them. Unexpectedly, recently these strange things have been seen quite often, so the automatic starting of a locomotive may also be one of the bizarre events. As the saying goes, "When the heavens rebel against the seasons, there will be disaster; when the earth rebels against its nature, there will be monsters; when people rebel against righteousness, there will be destitution." Given the current state of human affairs, why can't the mischievous creator play some tricks?</p>
<p>Moreover, the current world is a world of automatic driving. As long as you have enough firepower and enough power, you can charge straight ahead and drive automatically. For example, the Japanese disregard for public justice, tearing up alliances, forcibly occupying our three northeastern provinces, and opposing the League of Nations' mediation is the Japanese's automatic driving. With national crises looming and foreign disasters becoming increasingly urgent, instead of thinking about resisting foreign aggression, some ignore the orders of the central government, close their doors, and desperately engage in internal warfare. This is the warlords' automatic driving. Some engage in manipulative diplomacy, plotting and scheming, not caring about the people's suffering, not knowing that the country is about to perish, specializing in creating chaos, and not wanting to remedy the situation. This is the politicians' automatic driving. There are many examples of automatic driving, not just the locomotive on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway.</p>
<p>Chinese people not only drive automatically, but also like to drive in reverse. A car only has a forward path, and there is no reason to drive in reverse. However, Chinese people's cars often do not like to drive forward, but like to turn backward. So, no matter how much you change things, the result is that things get worse and worse. Rural areas are bankrupt, people are struggling to survive, and officials cannot provide relief, but instead add insult to injury, doing their best to exploit the people, cutting flesh to heal sores, causing even more harm. This is called driving in reverse. Soldiers are supposed to defend the country, and killing the enemy is their sacred duty, but our country's soldiers cannot defend the country and specialize in killing each other. This is called driving in reverse. Now, the cost of living in our country is increasing day by day, and livelihoods are becoming more and more difficult, but the modern society is desperately promoting extravagance and entertainment, which is also driving in reverse. Fortunately, the locomotive on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway, although it drove freely, did not go so far as to drive in reverse, which is good.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with regard to the Guangdong government, it seems to obey the orders of the central government, yet it also seems not to obey the orders of the central government. All matters of power and authority seem to be like the automatic driving of a locomotive, not completely bound by the orders of the central government. If human affairs can be driven automatically, why can't a locomotive be driven automatically?</p>

<h3>Method of Making Alcohol from Potatoes</h3>
<p>— Chen Chongru</p>
<p>The method of making alcohol using potatoes as raw material is divided into four layers as follows:</p>
<p>The first layer is steaming:</p>
<p>Grind the starch of the potatoes into a paste. First, wash the potatoes clean, put them in a steamer, and steam them until they are very cooked. Roughly, the starch in the middle has all become gelatinized. Then take it out and mash it very finely and put it in a bucket.</p>
<p>The second layer is saccharification:</p>
<p>For starch to turn into sugar, it must first go through saccharification. Add malt to the cooked potatoes. This malt contains a kind of yeast that can turn gelatinized starch into sugar. So, when adding the malt, stir it very evenly. After stirring, wrap the bucket with rice straw so that the temperature in the bucket is often at 63 degrees Celsius on the thermometer. Saccharification is easiest at this temperature. In about four or five hours, the starch will all turn into sugar.</p>
<p>The third layer is fermentation:</p>
<p>Fermentation is turning sugar into alcohol. At that time, the temperature should be low, often between 13 degrees Celsius on the thermometer. Then add a kind of yeast and stir it evenly. After seven or eight hours, when the sugar turns into alcohol, the temperature is easy to rise. In these days, pay close attention.</p>
<p>The fourth layer is distillation:</p>
<p>The sugar solution that has been fermented still has many impurities in the middle. To extract alcohol, you must use distillation to slowly extract it. One distillation is not very pure. It must be distilled several times to become all alcohol. Alcohol has a wide range of uses, such as in the manufacture of perfume, floral water, and medicinal solutions, which are indispensable.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is the Due Date</h3>
<p>— Sun Yuan</p>
<p>The class bell has rung for half an hour, but Professor W hasn't arrived yet. The classroom has turned into a talk shop, with everyone talking and laughing, talking about women and movies. This noise has reached the ears of the X Registrar in the office, but he doesn't dare to say a word, or even take a look, because he knows that if he steps into the classroom, he will immediately be questioned by the students until he is speechless. It's better to be "sensible" and turn a deaf ear.</p>
<p>Suddenly, several students spotted Professor W! How come they didn't hear his leather shoes? Actually, with such a racket, how could they hear him?</p>
<p>The talking and laughing gradually quieted down. Everyone took out their Conklin or Parker fountain pens, opened their notebooks, and straightened themselves up, posing as if they were about to write thousands of words. At the same time, dozens of pairs of eyes were staring at Professor W, as if they didn't recognize him, or as if they were trying to find some fault on his face, waiting quietly. Of course, there were also several pairs of eyes that were exceptions, focusing on something else.</p>
<p>Professor W's movements seemed much slower today. He slowly opened his black leather bag, slowly reached in, and slowly took out...</p>
<p>Ah! It wasn't a book, nor lecture notes, but a stack of white paper.</p>
<p>Ah! Another exam, annoying exam.</p>
<p>"Life-or-death exam," a female student whispered. "Today is the monthly exam," Professor W said, as if others didn't understand that there was to be an</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>exam, specially explaining it. At the same time, he raised the stack of white paper, as if to prove that he wasn't lying. Then, he turned his back and wrote the exam questions on the blackboard.</p>
<p>"Professor W, we just had an exam last week, why are we having another one?"</p>
<p>"The regulations here state that there must be a monthly exam once a month. We are almost three months late, we only had one exam, so we must have one today."</p>
<p>"Professor W, you didn't notify us last week, we didn't prepare, how can we take the exam?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, just write whatever you want. I was originally opposed to exams, but the registrar's office wants the grade sheets," Professor W said with a smile.</p>
<p>"If we can't pass, we won't take the exam!"</p>
<p>"No exam!"</p>
<p>"No exam!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Hey! Don't worry, just write whatever you want. This doesn't count as an exam, just consider it that I'm asking you to write an essay!" Because the "no exam" cries were too loud, Professor W raised his voice and said "Hey, hey" several times, but he was still smiling.</p>
<p>"If it's being graded, isn't it an exam? Haha!"</p>
<p>"Haha."</p>
<p>"Professor W, let's take it home to do, and hand it in to you next week."</p>
<p>"Hey! Just write whatever you want, why take it home to do?"</p>
<p>"Professor W, it's getting late, let's just go back!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Hey! Just write whatever you want in class, no need to take it back to do," Professor W finally said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Then, we'll just hand it in to you tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"Hey! Hey! Just write whatever you want!" He was still smiling.</p>
<p>Professor W finally walked down the podium and distributed the white paper one by one to the students. Some students in the front rows refused to receive it, but after Professor W explained, "Whether you take it home to do, or do it in class, you'll still need the paper!" they finally accepted it.</p>
<p>"Now, please everyone start writing." He said.</p>
<p>"Ding ding..." The end-of-class bell rang.</p>
<p>"Then we'll hand it in tomorrow!"</p>
<p>The sound of leather shoes disappeared as Professor W disappeared at the classroom door, followed by a burst of loud laughter, which replaced the students' triumphal song.</p>
<h3>Talking to Persuade</h3>
<p>— Peng Nian</p>
<p>There are originally no relatives and friends in the world, and even if there are, it is only when you are successful and powerful. Because the affection of relatives and friends is built on money.</p>
<p>Flattery is the most valuable thing. If a person does not have the art of flattery, no matter how proficient your talent and learning are, you will still be following in someone else's footsteps, and there is no hope of becoming a big shot.</p>
<p>If a person cherishes public property as much as private property, then public property will not be damaged.</p>
<p>The sweet time for the working class is at night, but the sweet time for the aristocratic class is in the morning. Because the working class is producing all day long, while the aristocratic class is still dreaming sweet dreams.</p>
<p>If all the expenses for weddings and funerals in the country were donated to refugees, then the refugees could at least get a day of comfort.</p>
<p>If we recognize that there is a country, and everyone fulfills their obligations a little, then the three northeastern provinces would not have been taken away by the violent Japanese.</p>
<p>The advertising power of Shanghai is truly greater than that of small cities. Because Shanghai is vast and densely populated, there are many similar businesses, so customers only recognize the advertisements in the newspapers, which are the businesses where they need to buy things.</p>
<p>The women of Shanghai are truly comical. Upper body in a leather-collar coat, lower body in shorts above the knees, and a thin silk cheongsam underneath the coat. What comical, what contradiction!</p>
<p>If the child beggars beside the tram stop are given a good education, can they not find pearls and gems in the trash can?</p>
<p>If college students put the effort of studying love into books, then all college students could become masters and bachelors.</p>
<p>High-ranking officials despise low-ranking officials as if they were even smaller than mosquitoes. This is because their vision is too great. Because they only know that there are superiors.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>If the manager's stern face towards the shop assistants is seen by members of the League of Nations, they will surely say that China is a country that is exhausting its people and engaging in military aggression.</p>
<p>If resisting foreign aggression was as enthusiastic as internal warfare, then Japan would have already been annexed by China.</p>
<p>If a person was as good as the obituary says they were, then China would have simply no corrupt officials, local bullies, or thieves acting as such.</p>
<p>In a store, the manager's monthly salary is eighty yuan, while the shop assistant's monthly salary is only six yuan. From this, it seems that only the manager has parents and children, and the shop assistant has no family.</p>
<h3>Life?</h3>
<p>— Nankong</p>
<p>Dong suddenly came to my residence, which was an unexpected excitement and joy for me. At the same time, he was also very happy and talked a lot, from his situation after we separated to the dryness of life, from social issues to national affairs, to the mention of the September 18th Incident and the Shanghai Battle. Resentment and indignation surged in our minds, and we felt that life was bleak! Especially for us in this situation of internal worries and external troubles coming one after another, the pain inflicted by "national crisis" and "family sorrow"!</p>
<p>"Gong! Don't you know that Wen is dead?" Dong sadly told me, with infinite regret showing in his eyelashes. His mood was serene. At the same time, Wen's sallow and thin face, round eyes, hidden in the deep recess under his eyebrows, and high cheekbones, which never showed a trace of a smile, were deeply imprinted in my mind. Now he has tragically passed away and bid us farewell forever! No! He has gone to the happy paradise!</p>
<p>Wen's experiences were indeed too tragic. His father abandoned him and his mother five years after he was born and died. The remaining inheritance was not enough to pay for the cost of a meal for the bourgeoisie. Fortunately, his mother's hard work maintained their livelihood and cultivated him for several years of schooling. Later, thanks to the promotion of relatives and friends, he was finally apprenticed in a store. Because of the poverty of his family, he was able to work very diligently, but unfortunately his mother did not wait for him to provide for her and followed in his father's footsteps. Grief struck his heart, and he felt that the good luck he had encountered was too cruel and dark.</p>
<p>After struggling through hardship and difficult struggles, he finally managed to revive the family foundation. However, the evil disease, tuberculosis, was entangling him. Driven by life, he did not have the ability to rest and recuperate. His meager income was only enough for the clothing and food of his wife and children. He still ran around in the wind and frost. In his constant coughing, he could often find chunks of bloody sputum. On his frowning yellow face, he became increasingly pale and thin. He knew that this was an express lane to hasten the end of his life and step into the tomb, but the lash of life could not but make him run around, otherwise! He would become a starving corpse!</p>
<p>In the dimly lit, low-ceilinged room, the orphan, not yet three years old, was curled up in his mother's arms, crying. The young widow, with her brows tightly locked, shed tears like beads falling from a string, and sobbed sadly as she looked down at Wen's portrait!</p>

<h3>Specific Methods for Amateur Organizations</h3>
<p>Mr. Editor:</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Hong Mingchang's small suggestion, he not only sighs passively, but also actively thinks of ways, which is very correct. If some young people have this spirit, not only can their own problems be solved, but the problems of the entire nation can also be solved. However, the two methods he put forward are actually only one, which is "contacting feelings and studying knowledge with each other." Simply having such empty methods is still not very useful. How exactly do we contact feelings? How exactly do we study knowledge with each other? Before we get concrete methods, I am afraid that the so-called contacting feelings is just getting to know each other, and the so-called studying knowledge is just meeting and talking. Therefore, we must have practical methods for everyone to study knowledge, in other words: there must be an organization. Here, I would like to put forward one of my opinions over the years and discuss it with everyone.</p>
<p>Last year, I planned to organize a Youth Hardship Study Association, wanting to imitate the method of correspondence courses, but without students paying fees. The declaration and articles of association had already been drafted, and I went to discuss it with several professors. Naturally, they usually also chanted the tune of seeking benefits for society, but when I mentioned that they should purely fulfill their obligations to undertake this kind of correspondence teaching, some were perfunctory, and some simply said that in Shanghai, it is not good to do things without money. Immediately afterwards, the "January 28th" incident suddenly occurred. My place of residence was in the war zone, and the drafts of the declaration and articles of association were also lost. Because of my livelihood, I was running around, and I invisibly put this matter aside.</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Hong wants to seriously study knowledge with each other, there must be such an organization. No matter what the name and method of the organization are, a correspondence school that does not charge tuition is most suitable for the environment of poor young people. Although some professors may not be willing to do such a purely voluntary thing, if you hire them in the name of your newspaper, they may not refuse. In case they refuse, then we must change the method, that is, if your newspaper is willing to take the responsibility of providing practical guidance, then this voluntary teaching must be borne by you. It is best to open a special column, such as: "Youth Lecture" or "Poor Youth School". Explain the questions they raise; and tell them how to study, or what to study; and sometimes you can gather them together at a certain time and place to have a sincere talk on the one hand, and examine their character and habits on the other hand, and then give further guidance. In the current Chinese society, schools have become the monopoly of a few people.</p>
<p>And most young people are disappointed, wandering, and even falling into depravity and suicide. The responsibility for this education must be borne by the news media, otherwise the danger of individual future will be the danger of the entire society's future, how important is the relationship!</p>
<p>Naturally, the opinions I have stated above may have some difficult points, but as long as this principle is adhered to, then the method of changing is not a problem.</p>
<p>I am a shop assistant, and I deeply feel the pain of being out of school, so I fully agree with Mr. Hong's suggestion, so I put forward a more practical method. But I also hope that you can give a satisfactory solution.</p>

<h3>Writing a Letter to a Friend's Wife (Continued - 8)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In this world, no matter what the matter, once you discover a small flaw, many big loopholes will be found out for you without any effort. First, I merely felt the boredom and vexation of home life. Then, the mocking cold words of my stepmother, the mischief of my younger brothers... all kinds of dissatisfactions piled up before my eyes.</p>
<p>Barely enduring the Gregorian New Year, I still held a vibrant and active heart and returned to Shanghai. As soon as I stopped my journey, the first thing I did was call you. Alas! This one phone call negated all the hard work I had put in over forty or fifty days!</p>
<p>In light of these two failures, even though my body was so exhausted on the day of my departure—burning hot all over and as weak as a dead man’s limbs—I endured the pain with a spirit of great sacrifice, fought back the illness, and resolutely took the night train on the Beijing-Shanghai line, leaving Shanghai, leaving your Shanghai, and departing.</p>
<p>Apart from you, there was nothing in Shanghai worth my lingering over. However, it was Shanghai that bestowed innocence upon me; it was also Shanghai that allowed me to truly understand the meaning of life; it was Shanghai that, out of nowhere, pushed you into my longing thoughts, adding such a poignant and bittersweet episode to my life, a story that made me both laugh and cry. In the twenty-five years I’ve lived, the many farces I have performed, the most joyful, the most painful, and the most deeply stimulating, all took place in Shanghai. Therefore, at this final farewell, no matter how dark or sordid its original face may be, I cannot help but feel a bit downhearted.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai line night train departed at 11 o’clock as usual. At 10:48, I squeezed my weak, like a stove cat, body into the half of the train station that barely survived the mercy of the Great Japanese Air Force bombs.</p>
<p>The reason for my delayed arrival was not that my sacrificial courage had been hindered, but that my conscience suddenly had a deeper revelation. I felt that no matter how unworthy my family was of my attachment, my father, my wife, my daughter, they were, after all, in the position of creditors towards me—creditors of love! How could I quietly leave and completely shirk my debts?</p>
<p>I didn't plan to leave a single word to my family. If I had to leave anything, then only the four words "deserves ten thousand deaths" would be most fitting and sincere. Anything beyond that would inevitably be contrived. Rather than that, I wouldn't write anything! So, my conscience made a discovery, but I didn't leave a letter. Since I wasn't leaving a letter, I had to find something else that could represent the meaning of leaving a letter.</p>
<p>Naturally, this would only be material compensation.</p>
<p>Last year, didn’t I write a book called “Observations on International Trade,” published by the ×× Bookstore? On that manuscript, dear little friend, I remember you also wrote several lines! The price of this one great work of Zhu Jinchi’s entire life, although I had fought for it like it was human life and got it up to eight hundred yuan, but later, the introducer left, and this money never reached my pocket. I could have given up these small rights. For me, these sacrifices would not have caused any feeling at this point, but in order to repay my father, wife, and daughters in case of any need, I had to apologize to the big boss. I used extremely stern methods and, within four or five hours, recovered these eight hundred good silver dollars. Along with the many clothes and hats I had left behind, they all became my legacy when I left. Perhaps my family has already fully received them at this moment.</p>
<p>Whether such an arrangement can give my father, wife, and daughters some comfort, or whether it will increase their pain even more, is something I cannot control.</p>

<h3>Hollywood's Postmen (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Guang Yi</p>
<p>In the past, many letters were sent to Hollywood with only "It" written on the envelope, and the postman would deliver it to Clara Bow. Others, such as those addressed to "Mr. Benllur," would be sent to Ramon Novarro. Letters addressed to "The Man of a Thousand Faces" were given to Lon Chaney, who is now deceased.</p>
<p>William Boyd received a letter addressed to "The Cop," which was a role he had played in a film. In addition, letters addressed to "Tony" were sent to Tom Mix.</p>
<p>David Lee, a young star at Fox Studios, was too young to read his own mail, but he received many letters every day, which were opened and handled by his mother. Once, he received a small red letter containing nothing but a drawing of a rabbit.</p>
<p>Some fans wrote to "Leo," which was the name of the lion in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer logo. Others wrote to the cocky rooster in the Pathe company logo.</p>
<p>According to a statistic, approximately 885,000 fan letters are sent to Hollywood each month. Paramount alone receives an average of 197,000 letters each month. Some of these letters are sent by airmail.</p>
<p>Fans often include their addresses on the envelopes and write "Return to Sender if Undeliverable." However, the postmen are happy to do their best to identify the stars they are trying to reach from the strange and peculiar addresses on the letters. The stars who receive the letters rarely say that they were misdelivered.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>On "Jade Face Disaster"</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>The name "Jade Face Disaster" (Convicted), which premiered at the Nanjing Grand Theatre yesterday, sounds so romantic and alluring, but the content is not so alluring. It would be better to use a direct translation or a more detective-oriented title that is more accurate.</p>
<p>The content is as follows: On a ship, a solitary actress is pursued by two men, one a musician, the other a great detective. The musician is killed, and the evidence clearly points to the woman as the murderer. However, the great detective uses every method to find the real culprit, who turns out to be a crew member on the ship, who committed the crime due to a monetary grudge. As a result, the detective and the actress become good companions.</p>
<p>This film cannot be called bad. Many short segments include both detective work and love, and it is certainly not easy to take care of every aspect.</p>
<p>The male lead, Jameson Thomas, is silent, eloquent, and moves in a way that befits the identity of a great detective, but his expressions are sometimes insufficient. The female lead, Aileen Pringle, does a good job. Although there are only a few close-ups, they are still very good. However, it is not appropriate that she is portrayed as an actress in the film. I think it would be better if she were just a woman traveling or an employee going to work, because she really doesn't have the "skill" of an actress. Richard Tucker, who plays the musician, is commendable. He performs the personality of the villain well and can be called "skilled." Many supporting actors are also watchable.</p>
<p>A film often shows some sea views, not forgetting that it is a story on a ship, and there are also ingenious branches inserted to adjust, which is certainly the director's care. However, he—the director—neglected the overall structure. With such a plot and competent actors, he made something that could have been tense into something ordinary. The film's core is based on "detective work," and there are many places where techniques could have been used to create a stimulating and mysterious masterpiece, but everything was destroyed by him, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>There are many supporting actors, and their roles are also complicated, so the main characters are often submerged, making the audience's spirits relax, and the film becomes very scattered.</p>
<p>The sound is good and not too lengthy, but at the first screening in Nanjing yesterday, there was a lot of noise in the first four reels, and the sound tape was even damaged by the projector. I believe this is not the fault of the film, and the Nanjing machine room should be more careful.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it is watchable, but it certainly won't give you the tense shivers like the advertisements say, and there is no "mysterious and winding" "fog of uncertainty" placed before you.</p>
<h3>Am I to Be a Fish?</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>There is a saying in Hollywood: "If the mermaid on the sandy beach is as beautiful as Gloria Stuart plays her, then men all over the world would join the navy and be willing to be a sailor." Indeed, her healthiness and sparkling blonde hair are enough to make anyone fall in love.</p>
<p>Recently, many people in Hollywood were disappointed because she has married a successful young sculptor. Of course, this makes anyone jealous and envious.</p>
<h3>Little Fairbanks and Joan Crawford</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Little Fairbanks and Joan Crawford are a well-known couple, the most famous and perfect couple in Hollywood. Although many newspapers have campaigned against them, saying they are going to divorce, this rampant trend in Hollywood has not affected them. Little Fairbanks belongs to United Artists, and his recent film is "War Nurse", which was shown at the Carlton last month. Joan Crawford, however, is a basic star of MGM. Her recent films are "Letty Lynton", which was shown at the Cathay, and "Grand Hotel", which is about to be shipped overseas. The two have never co-starred. During the American general election this year, Joan was the second queen out of tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>Tidbits from the Film Stage</p>
<h3>"Capturing the Spirit, Neglecting the Appearance"—Joan Crawford's Imitation of Greta Garbo</h3>
<p>— Olive</p>
<p>Greta Garbo's profound performance, intense emotions, and bewitching movements have left an indelible impression on anyone who has seen her films.</p>
<p>Many people in Hollywood imitate her style, but most of them "neglect the spirit and capture the appearance," with no charm. Joan Crawford, after years of effort, has been able to obtain Garbo's charm.</p>
<p>She can take Garbo's excellent qualities and apply them to what suits her, while abandoning everything that is not suitable. For example, Garbo's hair is praised by people, and Joan Crawford, because her face shape and eyes are similar to Garbo's, adopted Garbo's style. In the dialogue section, Joan Crawford knows that her raw American accent is more pleasant to listen to than Garbo's hoarse voice, so she still uses her own voice.</p>
<p>In fact, in the eyes of critics, Joan Crawford is indeed someone who can imitate Garbo and capture her spirit. Joan Crawford does not blindly imitate Garbo; she can develop her own personality that has not been fully developed. In each new film, anyone can notice her amazing progress. It is said that in the film "Grand Hotel," she has the same performance as Garbo.</p>
<p>New Film Introduction</p>
<h3>"The Bitter Tea of General Yen" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Crane</p>
<p>Hollywood-made films about Chinese society, such as Marlene Dietrich's "Shanghai Express" or Rock's "The Bitter Tea of General Yen", have many inaccuracies or excesses, so Chinese people always feel that people intentionally insult our nation and must be overthrown.</p>
<p>This kind of thinking has long been buried in our minds. When the news of "The Bitter Tea of General Yen" being filmed came to China, before we knew its content, we always felt some suspicion in our hearts: is there anything insulting to our country in it?</p>
<p>Now, the November issue of ScreenRomance has published its full text. After reading it in detail, I feel that there is nothing detrimental or insulting to our country.</p>
<p>The plot is as follows: An American girl named Megan Davis travels from Boston to Shanghai, preparing to marry her former classmate and lover, Dr. Robert Strike, a missionary in Shanghai. At the time, there was a war in Zhabei, and Dr. Strike was busy with relief work for the refugees, so the wedding was postponed. She agreed and joined the relief work herself.</p>
<p>One day, she and Bob set out to rescue orphans, but were unfortunately scattered by the chaotic soldiers, and she was knocked down and fainted. When she woke up, she was in General Yen's mansion, where she met General Yen's concubine, Mrh-Li. Because the road was unsafe, General Yen kept her there.</p>
<p>Mrh-Li was having an affair with an adjutant and was sentenced by General Yen to be shot the next morning. Megan mourned her life and resented General Yen's tyranny. She went to General Yen to plead for mercy on her behalf. General Yen told her that "This is not because of my jealousy or revenge, but because she is suspected of leaking military secrets to the enemy." After a considerable amount of conversation and pleading, General Yen finally agreed, but Megan must be a hostage.</p>
<p>The gentle General Yen touched Megan's heart. Since then, Megan no longer felt that General Yen was as tyrannical as the Chinese warlord she had imagined in her mind. A friendship had developed between them. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Industry Investigation</p>
<h3>A Look at the Three Major Companies</h3>
<p>— Ji Shen</p>
<p>When it comes to the domestic film industry, Lianhua, Tianyi, and Mingxing are the three most important companies. Today, I will not go into details, but just record them one by one for the reference of film fans. I hope that those who know will not consider me meddlesome.</p>
<p>(1) Capital: In the economically bankrupt Chinese film industry, Tianyi, Lianhua, and Mingxing can be considered leaders. At the beginning, Lianhua had a set capital of two million, but the actual receipt was less than half of that. Any shortfall was fully borne by Luo Mingyou personally. Currently, Lianhua has a total of five major studios in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Peiping. The total assets are over one million. Mingxing, with its deep qualifications and years of surplus, has a perfect economic situation. Their organization is not like Lianhua, with Mr. Luo personally responsible. The amount of capital depends entirely on the enthusiasm of the shareholders. In urgent times, the board of directors will also find temporary solutions. As for Tianyi Company, it was originally the personal property of Mr. Shao Zuiweng. So, to know about Tianyi's capital, just look at Mr. Shao's private property. At present, Tianyi's capital has also exceeded 500,000 national currency.</p>
<p>(2) Business: In these trading ports of Beijing, Tianjin, Peiping, Shanghai, Hankou, and Hong Kong, there is no doubt that Lianhua has taken the first place, especially the so-called representative work "Humanity." The Ping'an Theater in Peiping, which never screened domestic films, actually made an exception to screen it. The Xinguang, which never screened silent films in this city, screened it for seven days and then added three more days. When it was the turn of Guanghua, it was screened for 17 consecutive days. However, Lianhua's films were not doing well in Southeast Asia. The once sensational "Love and Duty" could not find ten people upstairs and downstairs at the time of its premiere. (Luo Mingyou's report at Lianhua last year). Mingxing's films, because they cater to the tastes of the middle and lower classes, indeed have an advantage in business. A group of business grandmothers feel that they must watch Mingxing films. In the past, "The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" was the most popular domestic film, but the "A Laughing Affair," which the authorities intended to make a lot of money from, turned out to be mediocre. As for the business of Tianyi's films, on the whole, the situation is still good, but it is somewhat behind the time when they first filmed sound films last year.</p>
<p>(3) Talent: Regarding talent, Lianhua has many newcomers, Mingxing has many old people, and Tianyi has many new drama characters on the stage. However, recently, Mingxing and Tianyi have also been working hard to make progress, vigorously cultivating talent. Lianhua has eleven directors, Mingxing has eight, and Tianyi is very deserted. Recently, Li Pingqian left him again, which made him even more desolate. The number of screenwriters and photographers is still average, with no significant difference.</p>
<p>(4) Production: The company with the most productions is Mingxing. Tianyi and Lianhua also have a large number of productions. If you count them annually, Lianhua is no less than Mingxing, but Lianhua has five major studios and cannot surpass Mingxing, which only has one studio. Regarding this point, the order is Mingxing, Tianyi, Lianhua.</p>
<p>(5) Results: To talk about a company's results, you must think from the overall perspective. So, regarding the results of the films, Lianhua has firmly occupied the top position. From "Spring Dream in the Old Capital" to the recent "Struggle," we can fully understand that Lianhua's films are indeed better. The biggest disadvantage of Mingxing's film results is that they do not advance but stick to the old, and always maintain the attitude of the old brand. However, they also have their advantages, that is, they will not produce very bad films. As for the results of Tianyi, although they are not as good as before, according to the recent trends, the three companies have the determination to work hard, everyone is seizing art, following the times, and moving towards the path of success.</p>
<p>There are countless other issues about the three companies, and I will report to the readers another day.</p>
<h3>Gao Zhanfei is Going to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Xing Su</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei was originally a basic actor in the second factory of Lianhua Company. Now, he is also playing the leading role in the sound film "Spring Tide" produced by Hengsheng Company. He is really busy with his work. When United Artists hired actors in Shanghai, he was also on the list of those invited, and the contract has been signed. However, many of the directors and actors invited by United Artists have now arrived in Hong Kong, preparing to start work. Only he has not finished the films on both sides of Lianhua and Hengsheng and cannot leave. United Artists has urged him several times, and he really cannot delay any longer, so he decided to depart for Hong Kong on the 17th. He has sent letters to Lianhua and Hengsheng, limiting the completion of his films to before the 15th.</p>

<h3>The Qualifications a Good Actor Must Possess</h3>
<p>— Chen Dabe</p>
<p>You must be able to freely control and manipulate every subtle expression of yours. This is the qualification that every good actor must possess. This is also the unique ability of a performing artist. Who among all human beings cannot laugh? Who cannot cry? Everyone can cry and laugh. Everyone can make appropriate expressions when necessary. Everyone can unintentionally make extremely beautiful and artistic expressions. Why can't they be called performing artists? Why can only you enjoy this reputation on the screen? This is because you can freely control and manipulate every subtle expression of yours, and people who have not been trained cannot.</p>
<p>The crying and laughing that we have just practiced are the most basic and simplest expressions, but it is not easy to practice to the point where you can freely control and manipulate them. You have to cry like you are really crying, and laugh like you are really laughing. You certainly cannot be unmoved. But once you are moved, you lose the ability to freely control. This is something that everyone can understand without testing. For example, when you are acting in a sound film, you start laughing and can no longer follow the director's predetermined plan to continue speaking or make another expression within a few seconds, or cry profusely. No matter what, you cannot continue working according to the predetermined plan, and the company will waste a lot of film for you. This is still a good analogy. If you can't cry when you should cry, or you don't laugh when you should laugh, this loss is even greater. If you often make people suffer this loss, are you still embarrassed to be called an artist?</p>
