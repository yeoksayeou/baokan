<p>中華民國二十一年一月三日（申報)星期日）三)</p>
<p>時評</p>
<h3>敬告國民齋</h3>
<p>上海之戰不是上海之戰。而是全民族生死之戰。我國民應當有此認識。放棄以往之旁觀態。度而斷然下一奮勇參戰之决心。我鄭重的考慮之後。覺得中國國民有四件事可以。做應該做。而且是必須立刻做的。</p>
<p>（一）認定十九路軍國民的軍隊。對牠負起完全責任來。供給牠軍械。藥品。糧食及一切物質上之需要。並督促當地軍隊負起保國衛民的責任。以爲十九路軍後盾。</p>
<p>（二）年富力强的國民加入十九路軍或與十九路軍有同樣精神的軍隊在作戰上學作戰。以立全國皆兵全民保國之初基。</p>
<p>（三）國民該立刻發表一計劃。對陣亡將士家屬負起責任來。。使前線將士可以毫無後顧之憂的去應戰。有錢的人。現在該是用錢的時候了。無錢的</p>
<p>人。少吃一口飯也就把這件大事做成功了。一面還要督促政府。改善並属行陣亡將士家属撫恤條例。</p>
<p>（四）我們對於戰地避難來之人。民應以親人看待。使他們覺得是到了自己家裹一樣若坐視他們流落無依。便是我們未濜國民之責。</p>
<h3>國民的軍隊</h3>
<p>什麽呌做革命的軍隊。順從國民的公意以保國衛民守土禦侮的軍。隊便是國民的軍隧。這種軍隊。以國民公意爲無上之權威外患臨頭。國民呌他戰。他必是以一當十以一當百以一當千以一當萬的戰若長官依據民意令他保國徫民守士禦侮。他必服從。若長官違背民意令他放棄國土。對敵人不抵抗他必不服從。不但不服從。並且要將發亂命者推翻掉。因爲他所推翻的不是長官而是國賊。新岳飛决不是十二道金牌所能召得回。因爲他所服從的不是個人而是國民的公意。不是破壤國格之亂命。而是保國徫民之天經地義。這次蔣光鼎。蔡廷楷。載戟。不顧政府訓令。率領第十九路軍及上海義勇軍。向日本海軍陸戰隊應戰。便含有這種新服從之重大意義。十九路軍已經在戰績上證明他們自己是國民的軍隊。中華民國之希望。便在這樣的軍隊身上。從二十八日夜十二時至二十九日黄昏。斃敵數百人。打下飛機三架。奪得鐡甲車四輛。佔領日本海軍司令部。驅逐陸戰隊向東敗退。卒使日軍不得不向我方一度提出休戰之請求。這動戰績。不但是給了日帝國主義者一意料之外的嚴重的打撃。而且是給了全民族一種絶大的新希望。全國的軍隊起來。踏着十九路軍的血迹。造成國民的武力。收復已失國土。將一個可憐的弱國。變爲一個令人敬愛的大國。倘若觀望不前。自棄天職。那便是軍閥害國的軍隊。人人得而攻之。</p>

<h3>Announcement to the National Comrades</h3>
<p>The battle of Shanghai is not merely a battle of Shanghai. It is a battle of life and death for the entire nation. Our people should recognize this. We should abandon our previous bystander attitude and resolutely resolve to bravely participate in the war. After serious consideration, I believe there are four things that the Chinese people can, should, and must do immediately.</p>
<p>(1) Recognize the 19th Route Army as the people's army and take full responsibility for it. Provide it with military equipment, medicine, food, and all material needs, and urge the local troops to take responsibility for protecting the country and defending the people as the 19th Route Army's support.</p>
<p>(2) Young and strong citizens should join the 19th Route Army or armies with the same spirit as the 19th Route Army, learning how to fight in combat, establishing the initial foundation for national conscription and national defense.</p>
<p>(3) The people should immediately publish a plan to take responsibility for the families of fallen soldiers. so that the soldiers on the front lines can fight without any worries. Those with money, now is the time to use it. Those without money, reducing one bite of food will also help accomplish this important task. At the same time, we must urge the government to improve and implement the regulations on compensation for the families of fallen soldiers.</p>
<p>(4) We should treat those who have fled the war zone as our own relatives, making them feel like they have arrived home. If we sit idly by and watch them become homeless, then we have failed our responsibility as citizens.</p>
<h3>The People's Army</h3>
<p>What is called a revolutionary army? An army that follows the public will of the people to protect the country, defend the people, guard the territory, and resist foreign aggression is the people's army. This kind of army takes the public will of the people as its supreme authority. When foreign enemies approach, and the people call for them to fight, they will certainly fight as one against ten, as one against a hundred, as one against a thousand, as one against ten thousand. If the superior officer, based on the will of the people, orders them to protect the country, defend the people, guard the territory, and resist foreign aggression, they will certainly obey. If the superior officer, against the will of the people, orders them to abandon the territory and not resist the enemy, they will certainly not obey. Not only will they not obey, but they will also overthrow those who issue rebellious orders. Because what they overthrow is not the superior officer but a traitor to the country. A new Yue Fei will never be recalled by twelve gold tablets, because what he obeys is not an individual but the public will of the people, not a rebellious order that destroys the national character, but the natural law of protecting the country and defending the people. This time, Jiang Guangding, Cai Tingkai, and Dai Ji, disregarding government instructions, led the 19th Route Army and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to fight against the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, which contains the great significance of this new obedience. The 19th Route Army has already proven themselves as the people's army through their war achievements. The hope of the Republic of China lies in such an army. From 12:00 AM on the 28th to dusk on the 29th, they killed several hundred enemies, shot down three airplanes, seized four armored vehicles, occupied the Japanese Naval Headquarters, and drove the landing forces to retreat eastward, ultimately forcing the Japanese army to once propose a ceasefire to our side. These war achievements not only gave the Japanese imperialists an unexpectedly severe blow, but also gave the entire nation a great new hope. The armies of the whole country should rise up, following in the bloody footsteps of the 19th Route Army, creating the people's military force, recovering lost territories, and transforming a pitifully weak country into a respectable great power. If they stand by and do not advance, abandoning their duty, then they are warlord armies harming the country, and everyone should attack them.</p>

The Nanjing National Government Decides to Declare War on Japan at 2:00 AM This Morning (Reuters Urgent Telegram, 31st Morning)</p>
<p>The National Government Issues</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Capital Moving to Luoyang</h3>
<p>Exercising Freedom of Authority, Not Subject to Coercion, Responsible Personnel Have Already Gone North, He and Luo Remain in Nanjing to Preside Over Everything</p>
<p>The Nanjing National Government issued a declaration on the 30th, moving its office to Luoyang. The original text is as follows: Since Japan forcibly occupied the Northeast with military force, the government, on the one hand, respected the spirit of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and although the provocation originated from Japan, it still insisted on patience, waiting for the signatory countries to uphold justice. On the other hand, it strictly ordered the military and police to exert all their efforts to defend the local area and protect the safety of the people's lives, freedom, and property. It has been painstakingly maintained for several months, but Japan's encroachment has not ceased. Recently, it has even sent a large number of warships to Shanghai, and in turn sent land and air forces, using the pretext of the citizens' anti-Japanese actions to use violence and indiscriminately intimidate. The people's organization of groups to address national crises and resist foreign insults is originally out of patriotic enthusiasm. If there is no excessive action, the government will have no way to interfere. However, in order to avoid war, the government has not hesitated to repeatedly compromise with Japan's demands. Initially, it prohibited anti-Japanese speeches and actions by the public that were slightly intense. Then, it persuaded various public organizations to voluntarily cancel the anti-Japanese name in order to eliminate the excuse of a strong neighbor. At 1:45 PM on the 28th of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Government had already given the Shanghai-based Japanese consul a reply that the Japanese consul himself recognized as satisfactory. However, at 11:25 PM on the same night, the commander of the First Foreign Detachment Fleet of Japan suddenly issued a notice, forcing our Shanghai garrison to cede the defense zone so that its occupying troops could defend it. How could troops responsible for defending the territory respond to his demands? The Japanese army then immediately attacked our army, causing Shanghai to become a prosperous city suffering from the flames of war, and using an unrestricted policy of bombing with airplanes, the civilian population and property suffered terrible poisoning. The scale is enormous and inestimable. At the same time, the capital and important cities in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River also have Japanese warships provoking everywhere. The reason why Japan continues to use such violent policies, and even increasingly rampages, is nothing more than to threaten our government to submit to conditions that lose power and humiliate the country. The government bears the heavy responsibility entrusted by the people of the country, and only knows to maintain the national character and respect international credibility. It will never be subdued by force. It can only adhere to the original policy, on the one hand, supervise and encourage the military and police to engage in self-defense, and will never cede an inch of land to others. On the other hand, it still uses diplomatic means to require all countries to fulfill their treaty obligations. Japan's reckless initiation of hostilities and destruction of peace not only harms China's territorial sovereignty, but also destroys the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The government firmly believes that China has the legitimate right and obligation to defend itself against such atrocities. At the same time, it firmly believes that all countries, in order to maintain world peace and international credibility, will not sit idly by. Now, in order to fully and freely exercise its powers and not be coerced by violence, the government has decided to move its office to Luoyang. It hopes that the administrative chiefs and military officers of all provinces and regions will work together with one heart and mind, each fulfilling their duties, in order to stabilize the local area and ensure the peace of the people. It especially hopes that the people of the whole country will face the national crisis with courage and composure, not clamoring or being timid, so that violence will have nowhere to be applied, justice can be upheld, and the safety of the country is entirely dependent on this. May we encourage each other. Chairman of the National Government, Lin Sen, Premier of the Executive Yuan, Wang Zhaoming (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>The Nanjing National Government, due to the increasing foreign aggression, in order to defend</p>
<p>The national territory, safeguard sovereignty, eliminate threats, and fully and freely exercise its powers, issued a declaration on the 30th, temporarily moving its office to Luoyang. It is reported that the responsible personnel of the government, with the exception of He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, who was ordered to remain in Nanjing to handle all matters and maintain public security, and Luo Wengan, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who remained in Nanjing to preside over diplomacy, all other important personnel went north to Luoyang on the evening of the 30th to preside over everything (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs of Nanjing, issued a responsible statement on the 30th, saying: The foreign aggression is increasingly urgent. In order to defend the national territory, safeguard sovereignty, eliminate threats, and fully and freely exercise its powers, the government will temporarily move its office to Luoyang. After that, the public security of the capital, in addition to being actively maintained by the commander of the Nanjing-Shanghai Garrison, the commander of the military police, and the commander of the capital garrison, has also been ordered by the government to be handled by this minister. There is no need to worry about local public security (30th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Former Commander-in-Chief</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Issues a Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>Embracing the Determination to Shatter Like Jade</p>
<p>To Deal With the Brutal Sun (Japan)</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek, former Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force of Nanjing, stated that</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident occurred and the Japanese pirates are increasingly urgent, only by the whole country being united and rising up together to resist aggression can the crisis be saved. Therefore, on the 30th, in his personal capacity, he sent a telegram to all soldiers in the country, urging them to sharpen their fighting spirit and save the crisis. The original telegram is as follows: Limited to immediate arrival, all commanders, military academies, teachers, students, and comrades are informed. Since the start of the Northeast Incident, in order to avoid war and preserve the national foundation, the Central Government has not hesitated to endure burdens and maintain peace, hoping to awaken the Japanese pirates with reason and justice. Unexpectedly, the more we tolerate, the more barbaric they become. After the Shanghai Incident occurred, their demands were already painfully accepted, but the Japanese pirates still stubbornly forced us, repeatedly attacking our Shanghai defense forces, bombing civilian houses, and throwing grenades in the streets. Our fellow citizens are brutally trampled upon, and the demise of the country is imminent. Anyone with blood in their veins can no longer endure it. Our soldiers of the 19th Route Army have already risen up for loyal and brave self-defense. All of our revolutionary soldiers, at this time when the disaster of national extinction and racial annihilation is imminent, should all fight for the national character, seek survival for the nation, and fulfill their responsibility for the revolution. Embracing the determination to rather shatter like jade than survive like tile, they should deal with this brutal Sun (Japan) that destroys peace and disregards credibility. Chiang Kai-shek and all comrades have long shared weal and woe. Although I am now out of office, I am still willing to swear to live and die with all the soldiers, fulfilling my natural duty. I hereby report with all sincerity and blood. Everyone must sharpen their fighting spirit, share the same hatred, not engage in empty boasting, maintain the spirit of sacrifice, and be ready for battle to save the crisis. May the Party and the country be fortunate. Chiang Kai-shek (30th Special Society Telegram)</p>
<p>External Note</p>
<h3>To the Signatory Nations of the Washington Treaty</h3>
<p>Nanjing's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, regarding the Shanghai Incident, sent a note to the envoys of the League of Nations and the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty stationed in China. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the note, since September 18th of last year, when Japan wantonly occupied Shenyang, it has continued to actively implement its policy of military aggression in the three northeastern provinces and other important places in China. Now, it has even invaded Shanghai, where international commerce is concentrated. At 1:45 PM on the 28th of this month, Mayor Wu of Shanghai gave a reply to the Japanese consul's letter of January 20th, which was deemed satisfactory by the Japanese consul general in Shanghai. However, at 12:00 AM that night, the commander of the First Foreign Detachment Fleet of Japan suddenly notified the Municipal Government, demanding that the Chinese army withdraw and be occupied and defended by the Japanese army. At the same time, he immediately rushed into Zhabei with armed forces and first used machine guns to attack the Chinese army. On the 29th, he continued to attack incessantly, and used more than 20 airplanes to indiscriminately bomb Zhabei, a densely populated area. The area has been engulfed in a major fire, and many residents have been killed and injured. Local transportation agencies, as well as cultural institutions such as Jinan University and the Commercial Press, and major stores have been bombed and destroyed. They are still continuing their hostile actions, which violate international law, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant, and disregard the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations Council. In particular, it is a direct violation of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, not only have the lives and property of the people of all countries suffered major harm, but the foundations of humanity and civilization have also been threatened. The responsibility for this should be borne entirely by Japan. The Chinese government has extremely restrained from the various acts of aggression by Japan in order to comply with the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations. However, Japan has brazenly disregarded this and ordered the Japanese army to attack Shanghai and threaten the capital. Faced with its deliberate military actions to expand the incident, the Chinese authorities have been forced to adopt appropriate measures to implement its legitimate right of national self-defense. Shanghai is China's international commercial center. Now, under the serious situation, important places in China are also in danger of major incidents at any time. Japan's violation of the Washington Conference Nine-Power Treaty endangers China's sovereignty, independence, integrity of territory and administration. Your government, as the originator of the treaty (signatory nations), should urgently send a note, requesting your envoy to telegraph your government urgently, based on its sacred responsibility in the treaty, to quickly take effective means to strictly prevent all military actions by Japan within Chinese territory and all other actions that violate the treaty, so that the dignity of the treaty and the peace of the Far East can be maintained, and hope to investigate and handle this and reply. Sincerely, (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Issues Declaration Against Japan</h3>
<p>Decides to Do Its Utmost to Engage in Legitimate Self-Defense, Japan Must Adopt Means Other Than Military Force If It Wishes to Restore Friendship Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Luo Wengan, Foreign Minister of Nanjing, issued the following declaration on the 30th: At this most serious time of national crisis in the history of the Republic of China, driven by a sense of responsibility, I have no choice but to reluctantly respond to the urgent needs of the country and serve in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since the Japanese army invaded and occupied Shenyang and other parts of the Eastern Provinces last year, the situation has become increasingly unbearable. Now, the Japanese army has once again attacked Shanghai, and the situation is even more tense. Not only are international interests in danger, but also the safety of our capital is suddenly threatened. Although the Japanese side has continuously implemented its various acts of violence and aggression, the Chinese side continues to abide by the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, which oppose aggression and make war a national policy. The Chinese government has now decided that if the Japanese army launches any further attacks on Chinese territory, it will do its utmost to engage in legitimate self-defense. It should be known that self-defense and self-preservation are rights that all countries should enjoy, and it cannot be expected that they will be abandoned under any circumstances. The Chinese people are extremely willing to maintain and enhance their friendship with the people of all countries that treat us with equality and mutual principles. If the friendship between the people of China and Japan is hindered, it is actually due to Japan's continuous aggression. This continuous aggression cannot but produce its inevitable results on the feelings of the Chinese people. Now, if the people of China and Japan are to restore friendly relations, the Japanese government must adopt means other than military oppression. Military oppression will not only not heal this wound, but will also make it increasingly worse. Now that I have taken office as Minister of Foreign Affairs, I will naturally abide by the policy decided by the National Government and do my best to be of some small help. All the sovereignty, independence, territory, and administrative integrity that our country should enjoy in accordance with international law and international treaties should be ensured without any damage. I especially hope that the whole country will give me full support, so that my efforts can be carried through to success (30th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Li Du Counterattacks Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Li Du Arrives in Harbin as Commander-in-Chief of the Self-Defense Army</p>
<p>Japanese Armored Train Overturned in Laosha Gou</p>
<p>Yilan: Yu Shen was appointed by the Japanese as Commander-in-Chief of the Railway Protection Army and concurrently as Brigade Commander of the 18th Brigade of the Binjiang Garrison. He was scheduled to arrive in Harbin on the 26th to assume his duties. Ding Chao had already prepared to hand over the command. Li Du of Yilan, recognizing the urgency of the situation, acted swiftly and decisively, leading the troops under Ma Xianzhang's brigade and Feng's brigade ahead of schedule, arriving in Harbin on the morning of the 26th. They dismantled all the puppet organizations established by Xi Qia. In the afternoon, they engaged in fierce fighting with Yu's rebel forces in the Shanghao area for approximately six hours, resulting in Yu's forces being routed and one aircraft shot down. Yu led his remaining troops and fled towards the Fangcheng area. Since Li Du recovered Harbin, the Japanese side has lodged a strong protest and threatened Zhang Jinghui, demanding that the entire city of Harbin hoist the Japanese flag by the 29th. Li issued an order that anyone who removes the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun will be dealt with by military law. As a result, Harbin did not fall into the hands of foreigners. It is now reported that the Japanese army is sending a large number of reinforcements from Changchun. Li is determined to defend the country to the death and will absolutely persevere to the end. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yilan: The Li Du's army has advanced to the south of Laoshao Gou. Ma Zhanshan of Hailun, who is continuously winning battles at the front, arrived in Harbin on the 28th and met with Li. Military leaders and legal entities unanimously elected Li as Commander-in-Chief of the Self-Defense Army in order to command the entire force and jointly face the national crisis. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yilan: After Li Du defeated Yu Shen's army, the Japanese dispatched two armored trains from Changchun, forcing the Chinese Eastern Railway to transport them. When they arrived in the Laoshao Gou area, they were fiercely attacked head-on by Li's troops, overturning one Japanese armored train and annihilating more than 600 Japanese soldiers. They are currently engaged in intense fighting with the Japanese army. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Yilan: Since Li arrived in Harbin and assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Self-Defense Army, the morale of the people in northern Manchuria has been greatly boosted. Volunteer armies from various places have risen up in response, willing to join Li's command and defend the country to the death. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: At 3:00 PM on the 28th, Japanese Consul General Ohashi in Harbin visited Ding Chao and put forward the following demands: (1) Chinese troops are not allowed to be stationed in the city of Harbin; (2) Commander Ding and others will be restored to their original positions, but this must first be ordered by a senior official and guaranteed by Colonel Doihara; (3) Commander Ding and Commander Li must declare their obedience to the new government of Northeast China; (4) The troops of Ding and Li must withdraw from Harbin within the shortest possible time. If the above conditions are fully accepted, the Japanese will not use force. Ding replied with: (1) The Japanese side will immediately cease operations to Harbin; (2) The Harbin incident will be resolved through negotiations; (3) Chinese internal affairs should be handled by Chinese government offices. If the above conditions are allowed, the Chinese side will not take precautions. The two sides talked for two hours without reaching an agreement and dispersed. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: Li Du and Ding Chao formed the Jilin Self-Defense Army, with its headquarters in Harbin, inside the Changsui Railway Protection Headquarters. Public Counselor, Adjutant, Transportation, Military Law, Military Medicine, and Military Supplies - six departments. Li and Ding jointly served as Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: This morning at 7:00 AM, the Railway Protection Army armored train returned to Harbin. At noon, three battalions of the 28th Brigade were loaded and departed for Caijiagou. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: Li Du telegraphed to pursue Zhao Yi's brigade of Yu's army, ordering them to quickly open Shuangcheng to defend it. Zhang's regiment of the 25th Brigade and Wang's regiment of the 26th Brigade were ordered this morning to go to Shuangcheng to assist in the defense. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: On the night of the 28th, the Japanese army repaired three Songhua River locomotives with a total of thirty-eight cars and headed to Sanchahe. Due to mistakenly entering a switch, one train derailed, overturning several cars and resulting in hundreds of casualties. At 7:00 AM this morning, they marched on foot towards Caijiagou. (30th Dispatch) Harbin: At 10:00 AM today, a Japanese aircraft came to Harbin for reconnaissance, flying very high. It landed at the airport. At noon, it carried two Harbin Consulate officials and flew to Changchun. Japanese residents in the Harbin Daoli district piled sandbags and barbed wire on the streets. Veterans armed with weapons and wrapped in white cloth mobilized. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: Ding Chao appointed Wang Ruihua as his deputy to command his 28th Brigade, and Wang Weifan commanded the volunteer army. They arrived in Harbin this morning, awaiting Li Du's review and integration. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: This afternoon, Yu visited Li Du and talked about the September 18th Incident, expressing deep grief. He had planned to launch an uprising during the Battle of Heilongjiang, but his troops were scattered and stationed in various countries, making it impossible to gather them at once. Furthermore, due to insufficient military supplies, he had been working hard to replenish them. He originally needed more than a month, but due to the urgency of the situation, he disregarded everything and set out on this journey. It was not for territory or personal gain, but because preserving even an inch of national territory is considered fulfilling the duty of a soldier. Sacrificing everything is not a pity, but he is confident that he has the ability, otherwise he would not dare to launch an uprising. The Japanese side has contacted him several times recently, but he has rejected them all because there is no need for direct negotiations at this time. Currently, there are tens of thousands of allied troops. He plans to eliminate Yu's rebel forces first for convenience, or form a supreme military and political command organization, which may be realized within days. Li is a veteran general of Jilin. In the defense against Russia in the eighteenth year, he led troops to resist Russia at Sanjiangkou. He is extremely loyal and resolute. Li Du requested Zhao Jinlin, the Chief of Staff of the Railway Protection, to serve as the Harbin Garrison Commander and announced the imposition of martial law on the 30th. Jin Ronggui, the head of the Special Police Department of Martial Law, resigned due to illness. Ding Chao and Li Du jointly appointed the former Wang Ruihua to take over. He took office today. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: A telegram from Harbin at 10:00 AM on the 29th reported that the Japanese Consul General Ohashi in Harbin stated that there are 6,000 Japanese residents in Harbin whose lives and property are in danger. He requested the Chinese Eastern Railway to allow the transportation of troops to Harbin to protect the residents. This matter has been rejected by the Russian Deputy Director of the Eastern Railway, who stated that due to instructions from Moscow to strictly adhere to neutrality, it is absolutely forbidden for both the Chinese and Japanese sides to use the railway to transport troops from Shanhaiguan. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beijing: A telegram from Jinxi at 8:00 PM on the 29th reported that the Japanese troops in the Jinxi area have all withdrawn to the railway line. The county seat of Jinxi has been recaptured by the volunteer army. The puppet government of Fengtian plans to move Jinxi County to Lianshan Fortress and the county seat to Goubangzi North. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Hirota, visited the Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan today and delivered a document regarding the situation in Harbin, stating that the Japanese government is willing to avoid misunderstandings with Soviet Russia and that Japan has no choice but to send troops to Harbin for the sake of thousands of Japanese residents. Japan has no intention of hindering the interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the transportation of troops will be charged according to regulations. Karakhan replied that the actions taken by the Japanese authorities in Harbin are precisely what is causing misunderstandings. The officials of the Chinese Eastern Railway were only formally notified twelve hours after the Japanese troops boarded the train in Changchun. This kind of action cannot be considered reasonable. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: The Chinese Eastern Railway Harbin-Changchun train is still not running today. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: At 8:00 AM this morning, 500 Japanese soldiers, together with 2,000 troops under Yang Dengju of the Changdun Railway Guard Brigade under Xi Qia's command, forcibly opened Chinese Eastern Railway vehicles, and driven by Japanese drivers from the South Manchuria Railway, drove north from Kuanchengzi. At Yaomen Station, they engaged in fierce fighting with Ding Chao's Railway Protection Armored Train Team. The artillery fire from both sides was fierce. After an hour of attacking, the Japanese side used two aircraft to provide aerial support by dropping bombs. At the same time, a separate detachment circled around to the rear to destroy the railway tracks. The armored train then retreated to the Songhua River and Taolaizhao Station at 9:00 AM. When our armored train retreated, it burned the Songhua River wooden bridge. The Japanese and Xi's cars have now advanced to Yaomen Station. Zhao Yi and Chen Liancai's regiment of the 22nd Brigade, reorganized by Li Du into a Provisional Brigade, were sent to Taolaizhao this afternoon as reinforcements. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harbin: Japanese aircraft came to Harbin three times today.

<p>Soviet Russia Protests to Japan</p>
<h3>Infringement of Rights and Interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan today notified the Japanese Ambassador to Russia, Hirota, that if China, which has semi-sovereign rights, does not object to Japan's use of the Chinese Eastern Railway to transport troops, Russia can also agree, but this is limited to not harming the interests of the railway. Karakhan also stated that he had notified the Soviet Russian personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau in Harbin of this decision. However, Karakhan also protested the Japanese army's free seizure of Chinese Eastern Railway vehicles and heading north, only seeking the Bureau's consent twelve hours after the event occurred. Japanese Ambassador Hirota stated that the Chinese mutineers in Harbin endangered the Japanese residents in the area, so it was necessary to take emergency measures, but this did not harm the Bureau's interests. Karakhan and Hirota issued a statement after their meeting today, intending to dispel rumors of strained relations between Japan and Russia and avoid unexpected events. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to recent newspaper reports, relations between Russia and Japan are becoming strained as a result of Russia's rejection of Japan's use of the Chinese Eastern Railway to transport troops. The Ministry of the Army issued a statement in the newspaper today, stating that Soviet Russia's attitude is not neutral, as Soviet Russia previously allowed Ma Zhanshan's army to use the railway. According to reports from Harbin, 3,000 employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway have been armed and are providing arms to Ding Chao's army. Another report states that Ding Chao is now asking the General Manager of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Rudy, to request the Russian government to send troops to aid him. Ding Chao also telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, stating that he is determined to cooperate with Soviet Russia to resist the Japanese army's advance. According to a report from Changchun, the Japanese army is determined to temporarily manage the southern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway because Chinese and Russian employees are unwilling to work. Therefore, 400 employees have been transferred from the South Manchuria Railway. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>League of Nations Administrative Council</p>
<h3>Holding a Public Meeting</h3>
<p>Debate on Invoking Article 15; Decision to Organize a Committee to Collect Reports on the Shanghai Incident</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Tokyo government stated today that Japan may withdraw from the League of Nations if the League invokes Articles 10 and 15 of its charter. The Seiyukai party, when not in power, passed a resolution stating that if the League insisted on its unreasonable attitude, Japan should withdraw. The spokesperson also said it was regrettable that the League still considered China an orderly and responsible country, which was merely a nominal title. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>The Geneva Administrative Council reconvened today but did not discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute, only routine matters. The Bangkok Opium Conference was also one. The Manchurian issue was not on the agenda. The Chinese representative explained China's reasons for not joining the Bangkok Conference, stating that China shared the same views as the American observers in Bangkok, namely, that as long as the monopoly system was maintained and the powers were unwilling to discuss a complete ban on the opium trade, China was unwilling to cooperate. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>This morning in Geneva, when the Administrative Council finished its routine business, Secretary-General Drummond suggested that member states of the Administrative Council with representatives stationed in Shanghai, whose positions could provide information about the Shanghai Incident, should organize a committee to compile a report on current events and send it to the Secretariat. However, countries related to the Shanghai case should not participate. Drummond stated that his ability was limited to seeking information on the Shanghai case based on Article 15 and that he would no longer mention the Manchurian issue, as the Council had already handled the case and its adopted plan was, in his judgment, quite appropriate. Council Chairman Paul Hymans endorsed Drummond's statement, and representatives from Britain, Italy, Germany, and other countries declared their willingness to join the committee proposed by Drummond and solicit information from their consuls-general in Shanghai. Japanese representative Sato stated that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai were willing to assist. He also said that Dr. Yen had accused Japan of violating Article 10 of the League of Nations charter and infringing upon China's territorial integrity, but since former representative Yoshizawa had already issued a declaration, he could assure the Administrative Council that Japan had no territorial ambitions in Manchuria or other parts of China. We are merely establishing legal rights to protect our nationals. However, the Japanese government's determination remains unchanged. Once banditry is eradicated, the safety of Japanese residents can be guaranteed, and the railway can be protected from attacks, Japanese troops will withdraw into the railway zone. Sato continued that the Administrative Council had once recognized Japan's right to self-defense, and Japan was only exercising this right without violating Article 10, which concerns territorial integrity, and that this could now be extended to the Shanghai case. The actions of Japanese troops in Shanghai were also for the protection of Japanese nationals. Sato then read a telegram from the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai regarding the development of the Shanghai Incident. During the Administrative Council's hour-long debate on the interpretation of Article 15, Sato stated that when the Finnish dispute was brought before the Council in the past, the committee had refused to proceed under Article 15. While the importance of the Sino-Japanese dispute and the Finnish case were different, why did the Administrative Council treat Finland and Japan differently? The rapporteur of the Finnish case stated that Finland had not specifically invoked Article 15 at the time. Sato said he would report the Administrative Council's views to his government. Chairman Paul Hymans declared that his colleagues had all expressed agreement regarding the automatic invocation of Article 15, and the debate ended. Dr. Yen rose and said in a slightly harsh tone that while his speech on procedural issues was interesting, he could not help but feel regret. The meeting ended at 2:10 PM. Dr. Yen told the Administrative Council today that the League of Nations' efforts to end the Shanghai Incident were admirable, but the Administrative Council should address the root cause. If Manchuria continued to suffer openly and the overall situation remained dangerous, new incidents would always be at risk of occurring. His intention was not only to invoke Article 15 for the Shanghai case, but he had this intention before he received news of the Japanese troops attacking Zhabei. However, Manchuria was the crux of the matter, so he hoped to report to his government that the Administrative Council would take effective steps to end the dispute. While Shanghai was important, Manchuria was even more important. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council in Geneva convened today. Chinese representative Dr. Yen Hui-ching, on behalf of the Chinese government, formally invoked Articles 10 and 15 of the League of Nations charter. According to these articles, the Administrative Council must immediately begin an independent investigation and act in accordance with the findings. This move by the Chinese representative caused a sudden change in the entire situation, and the Administrative Council was visibly shaken. It was generally acknowledged that China's invocation of Articles 10 and 15 of the charter had placed the Administrative Council in a difficult position. The Administrative Council would use all its power to find a solution that would not damage the League's prestige. Chairman Paul Hymans stated at the public meeting of the Administrative Council that the powers had already used their power to prevent the situation from developing as it unfortunately had. He further stated that any solution in the declaration read yesterday that conflicted with the League of Nations charter could not be endorsed by the League, without saying that the situation had now changed due to China's invocation of Article 15. However, the League's procedures and efforts would continue to be effective. Since China had appealed to Article 15, the Administrative Council had no choice but to act in accordance with this article. The Administrative Council could not shirk its responsibilities under the charter, so we must now ask the Secretary-General what course he should take. Dr. Yen said that Japan's use of force to seek a resolution to the Sino-Japanese dispute was a direct violation of the charter, so China felt it necessary to appeal to Article 15 of the charter to strengthen the Administrative Council's hand. Dr. Yen then read a telegram regarding the Japanese military's invasion of Shanghai and stated that Japan must bear full responsibility. Sato replied that the development of the situation did not allow the Administrative Council to summarily end the Sino-Japanese conflict, which was regrettable, but the fault was not entirely with Japan. The telegram read by the Chinese representative seemed to imply that Japanese sailors attacked Shanghai without cause, but the telegram received by the Japanese delegation from official channels said otherwise. Sato then read a telegram from Shanghai detailing the origin of the Shanghai situation, stating that Japanese residents were endangered, so sailors landed to protect them, but they were attacked en route by regular Chinese troops, and the Japanese military headquarters was also attacked, so Japanese troops had no choice but to take self-defense actions. Sato also stated that the landing of Japanese sailors was based on the advice of foreign naval commanders. Sato mentioned Article 10 of the charter, saying that China claimed that Japan refused to accept arbitration, but Japan was unwilling to accept arbitration from any country, so Japan had never recognized the arbitration clause in the International Court of Justice Statute. Sato continued to mention China's accusation that Japan was destroying China's territorial integrity, saying that unfortunately, there had been many precedents for this in the Far East, and Japan was not the first to start this, such as the bombardment of Chinese territory in 1927, which Japan did not participate in. China's current appeal to Articles 15 and 11 of the charter would rapidly change the situation, and he did not know if the Administrative Council could handle this problem under two articles of the charter at the same time. The effectiveness of the previous resolution depended on the Administrative Council's decision. He believed that the League of Nations investigation team should depart later, pending the Administrative Council's decision on this point. China did not want to seek a solution through direct negotiations, but blindly submitted this matter to the Administrative Council under Article 15, and he believed that this matter should continue to be pursued under Article 11. He did not see that the documents and reports currently submitted provided sufficient reason for Dr. Yen to present his case under Article 15. He advised Dr. Yen to prepare a new document. Had China ever tried to resolve the matter with Japan through direct negotiations? The possibility of direct negotiations still existed, so why rush to invoke Article 15? Chairman Paul Hymans replied that the question of whether the petition under Article 15 was legitimate was not for the Administrative Council to decide. The Committee of Jurists, chaired by Japanese national Adachi, had ruled that the Administrative Council could not consider this question. The Administrative Council could only act according to the petition. The petition under Article 15 did not overturn previous actions, procedures, or decisions based on other articles, because Article 11 and Article 15 did not contradict each other, and the procedure under Article 15 did not prevent the Administrative Council from continuing its reconciliation efforts. Therefore, the Administrative Council must clearly accept China's petition. What was needed first was to seek information and a true understanding of the facts. Hymans, having spoken thus, asked Secretary-General Drummond if he had considered the measures he could propose. Drummond then rose and made a statement regarding Article 15, hoping that the Chinese and Japanese representatives would provide detailed reports, accompanied by official evidence, and necessary and immediate on-the-ground information. He would then propose a procedure tomorrow morning, but he might need assistance in seeking necessary information that was fair and impartial. Japanese representative Sato rose after hearing the Chairman's words and said that he did not fully agree with the Chairman's interpretation of the procedure under Article 15. He believed that the current situation was very serious and might affect world peace. The Administrative Council had a serious decision to make and bore a heavy responsibility. He was eager to correct the procedure, so he proposed to study this matter and present his views to the Administrative Council in Geneva. Hymans replied that the Administrative Council would not close tomorrow, so the Japanese representative could quickly present his views to the Administrative Council in the coming days. The Chairman then issued an urgent appeal, ending a discussion, asking the Chinese and Japanese representatives to telegraph their governments to stop any actions that could lead to loss of life and create an irreparable situation, and declared that the Administrative Council was closely monitoring the situation. Sato replied that he would gladly convey the Administrative Council's words to the Japanese government, but the actions of the Chinese representative today had made the complex and dangerous situation even worse and made a solution even more difficult, but he was willing to do his best according to the Administrative Council's wishes. Dr. Yen also said he would convey the League of Nations' request to the Chinese government. The Chairman then thanked the Chinese and Japanese representatives on behalf of the Administrative Council. Afterwards, the Administrative Council discussed other matters. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>It was reported from Geneva by Reuters that Nanjing had resolved to declare war. After this news spread from the Administrative Council's lounge, everyone gathered in hushed tones to discuss it. This news had been told to Drummond and Dr. Yen, but it was not mentioned in the Administrative Council meeting. At that time, the Council was debating the technical points of Articles 10 and 15 of the League of Nations charter. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>The news from Nanjing that China had decided to declare war on Japan arrived in Geneva just as British representative Lord Cecil was refuting the Japanese representative's claims. The Japanese representative said that the Administrative Council had authorized the Japanese government to take unrestricted military measures, which could extend to Shanghai, which was rebutted by the British representative. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation to the League of Nations denied that the Chinese government had decided to declare war on Japan. (Havas, 30th) London political circles seemed quite shocked to hear that the Nanjing government had resolved to go to war, saying that London knew nothing about this and could not explain the meaning of this move. According to reliable sources from the Chinese side, Chinese and Japanese troops in Shanghai were now observing a truce, but there were sporadic sniper attacks between soldiers. The United States had launched an initiative on January 27, asking Japan not to take actions that could affect the concessions before consulting with the powers. It was heard that Japan's reply had satisfied the United States. Britain had also taken similar steps, but Japan had not yet replied. Britain and the United States had asked the French and Italian governments to take this action as well, but the two countries had not yet expressed their attitude. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Two British Warships Sail to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Four American Warships Can Arrive Soon</p>
<p>London: Two British cruisers have been ordered to sail to Shanghai. One, the HMS Suffolk, departed Hong Kong at 7:00 AM this morning. The other, the HMS Kent, sailed from Batavia last night. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington: The flagship of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, the cruiser USS Houston, has been ordered to temporarily postpone entering Manila for repairs due to new developments in Shanghai. It is now heard that three of the four destroyers sailing from Manila will be stationed in Shanghai, and the fourth will be assigned to the Yangtze River Patrol. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Manila: The U.S. flagship USS Holmes Town is currently awaiting orders to depart for China. It can depart within 24 hours after the order is issued. Admiral Tayner has now moved aboard the ship. Destroyer Squadrons 13 and 15 are also preparing to depart and can depart within twelve hours after the order is issued. The French cruiser Waldeck-Rousseau departed here this morning for Saigon, carrying Mr. Pasquier, the Governor-General of Annam. It is rumored here that after the ship arrives in Saigon, it will continue to Shanghai. (National Telegram, 30th)</p>
<p>Singapore: It is heard that four British mine-laying torpedo boats, originally scheduled to sail back to Britain from Chinese waters, have been ordered to postpone their departure. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>MacDonald Discusses the Situation in Shanghai</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister MacDonald stated in Durham that it was deeply regrettable that the situation in Shanghai had reached this point. He did not want to delve into who should be held responsible for the incident. The governments of all countries around the world were exhausted in maintaining peace, and the result was still unavoidable, which was enough to make those with aspirations feel discouraged. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Warn Japan</h3>
<p>No Independent Action Within Concessions; France and Italy Asked to Take Joint Action</p>
<p>Washington: After a cabinet meeting today, Secretary of State Stimson declared that the United States and Britain had notified the Japanese government, hoping that it would not take military action within the public concessions. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Stimson made the following statement after announcing the U.S. note to Japan: "Several days ago, when the situation first became tense, I discussed the Shanghai situation with the British Ambassador, asking him to consult with his government. I discussed with the Ambassador a note to Japan, stating that the public concessions already had effective police and other forms of protection. Unless the Municipal Council's forces were truly insufficient to protect life and property, Japanese troops should not occupy the concessions." On Wednesday, the U.S. and British governments notified the Japanese government of this. A reply had now been received, guaranteeing not to interfere with Shanghai's international interests. The informal notifications, such as the one we sent to the British government, had been sent by the U.S. and Britain to the French and Italian governments. In addition, the U.S. government had not made any suggestions for international action. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington: The British Ambassador had sent a second note to Secretary of State Stimson, the content of which had not been disclosed. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>New York: The nation was gratified that Britain and the United States had taken the same steps to note Japan regarding the Shanghai case. The United States had clearly won the British's implication, as the United States had notified the British Ambassador that the United States had decided to break free from the Sino-Japanese policy and would take a policy of watching and waiting. Stimson had effectively ended the alarming talk and eliminated the differences of opinion within the cabinet. According to the New York Herald Tribune, Congress had shelved the various laws regarding restrictions on Japan, fearing that diplomatic negotiations would be complicated. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Washington: In addition to the United States and Britain sending notes to Japan regarding the Shanghai incident, British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay visited the State Department again today and spoke with Deputy Secretary Castle for a long time. After Lindsay left, Castle consulted with the Director of the Far Eastern Division, Hornbeck. The content was unknown, but it was rumored that the United States might have a second expression. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington: Official circles here are paying close attention to reports of Japanese troops invading American churches in Shanghai. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Paris: Responsible parties, referring to the Shanghai situation, said that France was naturally willing to take joint action with the powers in accordance with the League of Nations' attitude. France supported collective action and did not advocate for unilateral behavior. The French Concession in Shanghai had not been harmed, so the position of the French Consul-General was different from that of the British and American Consuls-General. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italy was paying close attention to the developments in Shanghai, but its concerns were mostly limited to commercial aspects. Italy was extremely unwilling for its commercial relations to be slightly disrupted, so it would support any measure that could restore order. Italy was also very concerned about protecting its people and clergy. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was now observing the Shanghai situation with great attention. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The British Ambassador visited Foreign Minister Yoshizawa yesterday, asking him to order the commander of the Japanese fleet in Shanghai not to take independent action within the scope of the public concessions. Yoshizawa replied that the Japanese were acting in close cooperation with local officials and related countries. The above was learned by Reuters reporters from reliable sources. It was heard that the British negotiation was completely independent and friendly, without the nature of a warning or protest, as with the United States. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: British Ambassador Lindsay visited Yoshizawa again this afternoon, and apart from discussing the Shanghai case, the nature of their conversation was not disclosed. It was heard that Britain and the United States had not yet jointly notified the Japanese government, and the U.S. Embassy had not received new instructions from the State Department.

<h3>Foreign Press Comments on Our Affairs</h3>
<p>Japanese Arrogance Leads to a Major Mistake; The Chinese Army's Resistance Is Beyond Reproach</p>
<p>New York: The American press was greatly shocked by the Japanese planes bombing Zhabei. The New York Times said that from the most lenient point of view, the Japanese military commander had made a tragic mistake. Their will must not be to make the Chinese call it "Japanese barbaric behavior." Japan must stop before advancing further. The newspaper also guessed that Britain intended to wait for the United States to take the lead. British Prime Minister MacDonald wanted to cut President Hoover's attempts to drag Britain into a major plan that could cause a war in the Far East, before he had won the support of the American public. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>New York: The reports from Shanghai that Japanese troops were bombing Shanghai with grenades had sparked outrage in the American Methodist Association newspaper, which said that bombing defenseless civilians was a violation of international law, even in wartime. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The evening newspapers all devoted extensive coverage to the Sino-Japanese incident. The right-wing newspapers only transcribed reports about the dispute and the League of Nations' handling of the issue. The liberal newspapers severely criticized Japan, saying that its actions were like "throwing fire on gunpowder." The Vossische Zeitung said that it was most interesting to note the attitudes of the Chinese and Japanese representatives attending the Disarmament Conference while soldiers from both countries were fighting. It also said that the Japanese army's new organization was far superior to China's, and concluded that the fire in Shanghai could spread to the world at any time. The Berliner Tageblatt said that if the Japanese demarche had been accepted by the Mayor of Shanghai, what reason was there for the Japanese invasion? It was extremely legitimate for the Chinese army commander in Zhabei to resist and no one could reproach him. The organ of the Democratic Party said that from the point of view of Europeans and Americans, it seemed that the God of War, bearing the mark of Japan, was in charge. Japan was doing this, it was true that the country had no ability, but in fact, it might not be entirely the case. The organ of the Nationalist Party said that Japan's progress towards China at this time showed that it was a great implementer of politics. The green in the world's political power was being used elsewhere at this time. Britain and France were of course standing on the sidelines, and the United States was also thinking twice about the Far East. Europe was collapsing again, so it was appropriate for the Japanese to let go. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The Abendpost criticized the Japanese's behavior in Shanghai. The Vossische Zeitung said that it was a strange shame and extremely absurd that the troops were actually fighting each other while the Chinese and Japanese representatives were about to gather in a room to discuss disarmament. It was undoubtedly true that Japan was taking advantage of the world economic panic in order to conquer China and become the hegemonic country in the East. The actions of attacking Shanghai would make people have to ask whether war could still be waged even though the only conference with the League of Nations Non-Aggression Pact had a Disarmament Conference. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>London: Today, the Manchester Guardian carried an editorial, saying that while the League of Nations Administrative Council was meeting, Japan unhesitatingly bombarded Zhabei civilians with aircraft and machine guns, an act that insulted the League of Nations to the greatest extent. It was doubtful that the Administrative Council would do much about Japan's contempt for the League. But one thing was surprising, that Japan was dealing with the long-suffering Administrative Council and had not yet gone too far. Shanghai and Manchuria were vastly different, and the interests of the powers that were members of the Administrative Council were close to the region, especially those of Britain. At this point, the Administrative Council almost had to take action. Any policy that disregarded the attitude of the United States seemed unlikely to succeed. The United States was now working to oppose the use of force, so we should work with the United States and the powers that would join us in the Administrative Council to implement passive resistance to international banditry. This at least would be a starting point. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London: Although the French newspapers did not downplay the seriousness of the situation in Shanghai at all, they did not tend to exaggerate the facts. Judging from the comments in the newspapers, France did not want to enter a "hornet's nest." It was the general opinion that the public concessions and the French concessions were very well protected. The Paris Echo said that the intervention of the powers would only aggravate the situation.

<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Our Troops Force Japanese Troops to Retreat into the Concession</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we achieved a great victory in encircling and attacking the remaining enemy forces. The Japanese troops in the Zhabei area were completely cleared. Large squadrons of Japanese warships arrived in the evening and are currently preparing. A temporary ceasefire was established last night.</p>
<h3>Latest News This Morning</h3>
<p>From yesterday afternoon until 4:00 AM this morning, both sides have entered a state of ceasefire. There have been occasional contacts between front-line sentries, but no formal conflicts. The situation has become quieter as the night progressed. Foreign sources report that the Japanese marines and plainclothes troops north of the Suzhou Creek have all withdrawn, and the police have dispatched officers to take over and maintain order. However, at 4:00 AM this morning, our reporter personally investigated the area around the Sichuan Road Bridge and the Waibaidu Bridge and found that Japanese troops were still on guard north of the bridge, strictly checking pedestrians and vehicles. Gunfire was scarce. The fire near the Odeon Theater was still raging.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Encircle and Attack the Remaining Enemy</h3>
<p>No Japanese soldiers south of the North Henan Road intersection. Japanese soldiers advancing along Wusong Road to Kunshan Road are encircled by troops on the Chuanhong Road near the Fanwangdu.</p>
<p>Yesterday (30th), by 6:00 PM, our military lines at North Henan Road, Fusheng Road, and Qiujiang Road remained unchanged, with no contact. Occasional gunfire was due to the encirclement and annihilation of Japanese plainclothes troops by our army at Fusheng Road and Qiujiang Road. There were about thirty to forty plainclothes troops at Fusheng Road and about fifty at the Chuanhong Road near the Odeon Theater. They were hiding in residential houses, so the search and suppression were slightly slow. However, these small pockets of resistance are deeply surrounded and will soon be eliminated. The Baoshan Road intersection north of the iron gate on North Henan Road is densely populated by our troops, with no trace of Japanese soldiers south of it. There are Japanese troops conducting defensive works on the Tianfei Palace Bridge, indicating that the Japanese soldiers have begun to retreat. There are still about a hundred Japanese soldiers in the North Sichuan Road and Haining Road area. The Japanese Club on Peng Road is also garrisoned by Japanese soldiers. It was besieged by our troops from 3:00 AM yesterday. At the same time, our troops at the end of North Sichuan Road advanced along Le'an Road and Tissot Road, detouring to attack the Shenjiawan area of Hongkou. After occupying it, they advanced along Wusong Road to Kunshan Road, where the headquarters of the Japanese Navy Marine Corps had moved. Therefore, the battle was fierce at that time. The sound of gunfire on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek was as dense as a string of pearls. It gradually subsided at around 4:00 AM yesterday. Shortly after, the Japanese soldiers used small cannons to bombard, but they missed. By daybreak, a total of three shots had been fired. Our army's front line is now in the Shenjiawan area, with the Japanese troops forming a horizontal line on Guangdong Street, the embankment, the Japanese Club, Kunshan Road, and Haining Road. There has been no bombardment from either side. At around 5:00 PM, our troops stationed on Qiujiang Road encircled and attacked the Japanese plainclothes troops on Chuanhong Road, causing gunfire to break out again. The Japanese plainclothes troops, unable to resist, set fire to the houses there. This is the origin of the fire that could be seen last night. It had not been extinguished by 8:00 PM. The Japanese plainclothes troops near the Fanwangdu Railway Station on Laobesheng Road in western Shanghai were also surrounded and attacked by our troops at around 5:00 PM, and the fighting had not stopped by 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Battle Situation Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>At 10:15 AM, approximately 200 Japanese marines attacked our military positions in two directions. One group attacked the sandbag piles at the west corner of the short wall of the Citibank camp on Henan Road, and the other attacked our defense line eastward along Wusong Road. They launched several assaults, but were met with a head-on counterattack by our troops. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. The stalemate lasted until 11:10 AM, when the Japanese army could no longer hold out and retreated to their original positions. One group retreated along Henan Road to the Tie Maliu vegetable market on North Henan Road, and the other retreated along Wusong Road to the Shenjiawan Hongkou vegetable market. Our troops, seeing the Japanese army collapse, remained firmly in their positions and did not pursue. After this, the gunfire subsided. At around 1:00 PM, another 20 Japanese soldiers sneaked to the sandbag position on Henan Road and repeatedly attacked the north side. Our army responded with a dozen shots, and the fighting lasted for about a quarter of an hour before stopping.</p>
<h3>Excerpts of War Reports from Western Newspapers</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the Japanese soldiers began to retreat from the North Sichuan Road area at 7:20 AM today (30th). Although the station had been flattened by Japanese planes with bombs yesterday, the Japanese soldiers attacked again this morning. The Chinese trained artillery force rose up and fought back vigorously. The Japanese soldiers suddenly retreated to the North Sichuan Road defense line. At 8:45 AM, shells from the Chinese artillery force fell on De Lisoon Road, Bazi Road, Zha Pu Road, and Yalujiang Road. The Shanghai Daily News and the roof of Nishi Honganji Temple were heavily damaged by shells. There was a great disturbance in the Kunshan Garden area at around 10:00 AM this morning. Plainclothes soldiers were shooting incessantly in that area all night. The Japanese soldiers suspected that these people were hiding in a Cantonese temple and searched inside, but did not find anyone. At 9:30 AM this morning, Chinese and Japanese plainclothes soldiers engaged in fierce fighting, resulting in many casualties in the Bazi Road and Haining Road areas. At 9:45 AM, the Chinese and Japanese plainclothes soldiers and artillery forces ceased fire. The refugees then took various vehicles and left the dangerous area, causing traffic jams. At 10:15 AM, gunfire broke out again. At around 2:00 PM, the sound of heavy rifles and machine guns was carried throughout the city by the wind, indicating that the two sides were engaged in another fierce battle. It is reported that a Japanese unit was cut off from its Hongkou base in the Jiangwan area and was in a dangerous situation. However, because the Chinese soldiers were firing incessantly, it is currently impossible to escape. The Hongkou area surrounded by North Sichuan Road, Haining Road, Yalujiang Road, and Zha Pu Road is entirely in the hands of Japanese soldiers this morning. The scene on Bazi Road this morning was unprecedented. The large glass windows of the shops at the intersection of the road and North Sichuan Road were full of bullet holes, all inflicted during the night. The road was littered with bullet casings. The trolley wires on Bazi Road had been broken in several places, and there were several brick and tile obstructions on the road, presumably knocked down by Chinese artillery shells. Today, the police patrol team did not go beyond Haining Road and Henan Road. Pedestrians and vehicles were ordered by special police officers to turn back on Peng Road. The machine gun team of our army at the entrance of the Tiantong'an Road (photo taken by Li Zunyong).</p>
<p>This morning, after the Chinese plainclothes soldiers fought, the Japanese reserves and marines conducted a house-to-house search in the Hongkou area. At around 10:00 AM this morning, someone threw a bomb at the Hongkou Theater at the corner of Haining Road and Zha Pu Road, damaging the roof and seriously injuring a Portuguese child in the neighboring house.</p>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reported that last night (29th), the British and American consuls in Shanghai initiated a ceasefire, which was later agreed upon by both sides to cease fire at 8:00 PM that evening, with each side holding its original positions. According to the official spokesman for Mayor Wu, the ceasefire negotiations began yesterday morning and were agreed upon by both sides at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. The Chinese people in this city believe that the Japanese soldiers' attack on Zhabei was a breach of faith, and that the Japanese soldiers should not have used the concession as a source of war. It is reported that the consular body has informed the Japanese authorities of this point. The Chinese councilor of the Public Works Department has lodged a protest with the Public Works Department regarding this matter. It was heard yesterday that Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, will also lodge a protest with the Public Works Department, and his attitude will be very firm.</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that according to a wireless message from Wusong, the Wusong fort is still in the hands of the Chinese army, and Japanese warships have not opened fire there. It is reported that two Japanese planes were shot down by the Chinese army, but this has not been confirmed. The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the night of the 29th was relatively quiet. The situation suddenly changed this morning (30th). The Hongkou area was greatly alarmed this morning. The Chinese plainclothes soldiers hiding in the Haining Road, Bazi Road, and Zha Pu Road areas were very successful in ambushing the attacking Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers seemed to be very embarrassed. The Japanese soldiers then decided not to sacrifice and to stop the Chinese plainclothes soldiers in the North Sichuan Road area north of Bazi Road. Therefore, at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, with the help of Japanese civilians, the sailors used kerosene and wood to set fire to the houses near the Odeon Theater. Due to the wind, four houses had been destroyed by 3:30 PM, and the Odeon Theater was also in danger. The Japanese soldiers did not allow the fire brigade to put out the fire. Japanese reinforcements are expected to arrive this afternoon. According to the Japanese authorities, after the Japanese soldiers arrive, they will land and join the battle. The 19th Route Army reinforcements arrived in Shanghai last night. It is heard that there are still reinforcements on the way. They are determined to fight to the death with the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Commander Cai's Speech</h3>
<p>Yesterday, our reporter visited Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Route Army, at his military headquarters to inquire about the actual situation of resisting the Japanese army. He said, "This time, our army's resistance to the Japanese marines in Zhabei is entirely a legitimate act of self-defense. On the afternoon of the 28th, the conditions demanded by the Japanese consul to the municipal government had been fully answered and accepted by the municipal government. Unexpectedly, at 11:00 PM, the commander of the 7th Naval Marine Corps suddenly presented an ultimatum demanding that our army immediately withdraw from Zhabei, otherwise they would take decisive action. Less than an hour after this ultimatum reached our side, the Japanese marines invaded the Chinese territory from the North Sichuan Road area and attacked our army's defense line. Under these circumstances, in order to defend the country, for the survival of the nation, and to fulfill the duty of soldiers and the dignity of soldiers, our army had no choice but to make a legitimate defense and resist. By the afternoon of the 29th, the Japanese army had been completely driven back to the concession. Our army's entire line was in the Zhabei Chinese territory and did not pursue. In this battle, our army captured four enemy armored vehicles and shot down three planes. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, and our army suffered about 200 casualties. On the afternoon of the 29th, at the request of the Japanese consul, our side ceased fire at 8:00 PM in the evening. However, the Japanese marines and plainclothes troops continued to attack our army's defense line from the concession. Our army believes that this act of bad faith is very unfair. In anger, our army had no choice but to continue to resist. Since the concession is originally a neutral area, and now the Japanese army is still using the concession for military action, the concession authorities should take appropriate measures to stop it in order to be fair. Otherwise, our army, for military necessity, cannot but take legitimate defense." He also said, "The entire 19th Route Army is now fully concentrated. No matter how rampant the Japanese army is, we will never give up our duty to protect the country and the people."</p>
<p>Furthermore, three members of the Righteous Army Committee of the Citizens' Union, Wang Pingnan, Zhang Zilian, and Jiang Junyi, visited Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, at 9:00 AM yesterday and stated that all the Righteous Army members of the Citizens' Union were willing to participate in the war and asked him to indicate the service locations. Cai said that the troops under his command were sufficient to deal with the Japanese army's invasion, so there was no need for the Righteous Army. He said, "You are all enthusiastic and can take on the work of seeking protection and maintaining order in the rear." Cai then said, "Our army's victory in resistance is entirely a victory of justice, not a victory of force. Moreover, the people's psychology this time is all demanding war. Many people say that they are willing to use their family property to support this war rather than endure humiliation and non-resistance. Therefore, I am very willing to base myself on the will of the people and will never have any room for negotiation."</p>
<h3>Commander Cai's Military Orders</h3>
<p>Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, issued five military orders to be jointly observed by all officers and soldiers after resisting the Japanese army for self-defense. They are recorded as follows: (1) Those who retreat in the face of the enemy will be shot. (2) Those who disobey orders will be shot. (3) Those who disturb public order will be shot. (4) Those who rob property will be shot. (5) Those who spread rumors to confuse the public will be shot.</p>
<h3>Police Department's Description of the Battle Line</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, according to the Garrison Headquarters, the Japanese marines and plainclothes troops had been completely repelled by our army to the east of Fusheng Road, Laobazi Road, the Hongkou vegetable market, Shenjiawan, Yangshupu, and Tissot Road. Our army's defense line extended from Baoshan Road and Fusheng Road along Songhu Road to the Hongkou Garden area. There was no trace of Japanese troops in Zhabei. It was also heard that the Japanese army headquarters had moved to the Japanese Club on Peng Road.</p>
<p>Municipal Government</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Two Protests</h3>
<p>The municipal government yesterday again lodged a protest with the Japanese Consul General, stating: "Sir, regarding the Japanese Navy's invasion of Zhabei, we previously lodged a serious protest with your Consul General. In recent days, the said Navy has abused aircraft to bomb the Zhabei area. All train stations and most commercial factories and civilian houses have been reduced to ashes. People have been killed and injured in countless numbers. Moreover, they have colluded with ronin [masterless samurai/rogues] in the vicinity of North Sichuan Road, setting fire to buildings and preventing fire fighting. This not only violates international law, but is also inhumane. The Mayor hereby lodges a serious protest and hopes you will investigate and instruct them to stop. Respectfully addressed to: Lee Tsun-yung (Japanese 6th Gendarmerie Unit defending Hongjiang Road)."</p>
<p>(Consul General of Japan stationed in Shanghai, Mura and Kuramatsu)</p>
<p>The municipal government yesterday lodged a protest with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, stating: "Sir, since the Japanese troops attacked Zhabei on the night of the 28th of this month, they have repeatedly used the Concession area as a base of operations during their attacks. This is inconsistent with your Council's stated principle of strict neutrality. However, we have not heard of any sanctions from your Council regarding the Japanese troops' actions in violating the neutrality of the Concession. We are deeply surprised and hereby lodge a protest, requesting that you investigate and take immediate steps to stop this, and hope to receive a reply. Respectfully addressed to: Meynaud, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession."</p>
<p>Our Troops</p>
<h3>Will Lodge a Serious Protest</h3>
<p>Since the evening of the 28th, the commander of the Japanese Marines issued an ultimatum at 11:00 PM, demanding that our garrison immediately withdraw from Shanghai and shortly thereafter attacked our troops. For the sake of protecting the soil and defending the people, our troops engaged in legitimate self-defense against the Japanese troops. In the fierce battle until 12:00 PM on the afternoon of the 29th, the entire Japanese Marine Corps was defeated and retreated into the Concession, and fought against our troops based on the Concession. Our military authorities were very indignant, but still respected the treaties and did not pursue them into the Concession, only defending the border area. Although our side, at the request of the Japanese Consul, ceased fire at 8:00 PM on the 29th, after 10:00 PM that evening, the Japanese Marine Corps and plainclothes teams continued to attack our troops based on the Concession. Therefore, our military authorities are extremely dissatisfied with the untrustworthiness of the Japanese troops, and also feel that the Shanghai Municipal Council, which declared neutrality, is particularly unfair. It is now reported that our authorities, based on the above reasons, will lodge a serious protest and make several demands. The main points are as follows: The Japanese side previously made conditions to our municipal government, which our side had fully accepted. Why did the Japanese troops still use armored vehicles and marines to attack our defense line on the evening of the 28th? This responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side. If the Japanese side requests a ceasefire, our troops can agree, but must fulfill the following conditions: (1) All Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai must board ships and withdraw from the Wusongkou [mouth of the Wusong River], and guarantee that they will not come to Shanghai again. (2) All plainclothes armed teams must be disarmed and must not engage in arson, riots, looting, or harassment. (3) The Japanese Consul and military commanders must apologize to our government.</p>
<h3>Consuls of Various Countries Protest to Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Actions Affect Public Order</p>
<p>Protect the Nationals in the Concession</p>
<p>The consuls of various countries, including Britain and the United States, are quite dissatisfied with the entry of Japanese troops into the Concession. Yesterday afternoon, the consuls of various countries discussed the impact of the Japanese military actions on the public order of the Concession at the Naval Club, and decided to simultaneously warn the Japanese side to cease military actions within the Concession and to order the Shanghai Municipal Council to take appropriate defensive measures. According to reliable sources, the British and American consuls in Shanghai have received instructions from their respective governments to effectively protect public order and their nationals, and their governments have lodged a formal protest with Japan. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council ordered all patrol stations last night to strengthen defense, and defense work within the Concession has also been properly arranged.</p>
<h3>British and American Consuls Mediate</h3>
<p>After the Chinese and Japanese armies ceased fire at 8:00 PM the night before, the American Consul General Cunningham and the British Consul General Barton, believing that the situation was still very serious, intended to take further steps to restore peace in the city. Our reporter interviewed the British and American Consuls General yesterday, who both said that the situation was tense and they were unwilling to express their opinions at this time. However, their associates told reporters that the British and American Consuls General and the British and American naval commanders had been working half a day yesterday for the peace movement, hoping that China and Japan would hold a peace conference in the shortest possible time in order to restore Shanghai to its original state as soon as possible.</p>

<p>French Concession</p>
<h3>Responsible for Protecting Residents</h3>
<p>Fevrier, the Commissioner of Police of the French Concession, issued a notice yesterday stating that the French Concession adheres strictly to neutrality, and the residents within the Concession are protected by the French military and police. It is essential to maintain calm and not lightly believe rumors, causing unnecessary panic. This is a warning. It is also reported that in addition to issuing a notice, Fevrier also instructed the Chinese and Western detectives that if they encounter foreign troops passing through the Concession carrying weapons, they must disarm them. City Chamber of Commerce and other organizations telegraph</p>
<h3>The United States Upholds Justice</h3>
<p>Please Use Strong Power to Stop Japanese Atrocities. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other groups sent a special telegram to US President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson yesterday regarding the Japanese troops' invasion. "To President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson in Washington: Relying on the Concession as a base, Japanese troops suddenly launched a fierce attack on Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other areas in the Chinese territory on the night of the 28th, bombing and setting fires day and night. The citizens have suffered terribly and inhumanely. Furthermore, they burned down the Commercial Press, which is related to Chinese culture, and all the ancient books were reduced to ashes. Even in formal warfare, it should not be so barbaric. The Concession authorities have divided the area north of the Suzhou River, east of the Songhu Railway, and along North Sichuan Road into a Japanese military zone, overstepping their authority and allowing the Japanese troops to act brutally. In addition to requesting our military and police to swear to defend themselves to the death, our Chamber of Commerce represents all the citizens of Shanghai and hereby telegraphes your government to uphold justice and use strong power to stop Japanese atrocities, thereby maintaining peace in East Asia. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, etc. kowtow. Yan"</p>
<h3>Conversation with Brigade Commander Weng</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Shi News Agency visited Weng Zhaotan, the brigade commander of the 156th Brigade of the 78th Division, yesterday to ask about his thoughts on resisting the enemy and the recent situation of the military at the front. At that time, Zhang Jun-song, the regimental commander of the 6th Regiment, was also present. Our soldiers lie on the ground to defend at the Baoshan Road intersection (Photo by Li Tsun-yung)</p>
<p>They jointly informed [the reporter], saying that since we are soldiers, our duty is to protect the country and defend the people. The Japanese are barbaric and unreasonable, invading our land and killing our people. We are determined to fight to the death to resist the enemy, win glory for the country, and demonstrate the spirit of the nation. Even if there is only one soldier left, we will resist with all our strength. Last night (the 29th) at 8:00 PM, we received an order from the division commander of the district, saying that the consuls of various countries were mediating and ordering both sides to cease fire immediately. Therefore, our troops did not fire a single shot from 8:00 PM last night to 4:00 PM this afternoon. However, Japanese soldiers and plainclothes teams continued to attack our troops in Qiujiang Road, Yokohama Road, and Tiantong'an. If this continues, mediation may not be successful. Our troops will advance forward and will never lose an inch of national territory. I (Weng) have studied in Japan for many years and know very well that the Japanese army is a useless army. Currently, the 5th and 6th Regiments are fighting in the south, the 4th Regiment is defending Wusong, and the 155th Brigade 1st Regiment is in Pudong. As long as we concentrate our forces and the military and civilians cooperate and unite against foreign enemies, we can be assured that there is nothing to worry about. At this time, there was a sudden telephone report from the front saying that the Japanese soldiers were attacking very hard and requesting instructions. Brigade Commander Weng then told the reporter that a major battle was likely to break out soon at the front. I also intend to visit the division commander to discuss the method of welcoming the enemy and go to the front to command. The reporter then bid farewell and returned.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Seizes a Large Number of Japanese Weapons</h3>
<p>When</p>
<p>On the previous day, the 29th (the day when our army fought with the Japanese soldiers at Qiujiang Road, Baoshan Road, Fusheng Road, and Tiantong'an Station), a thousand members of the Shanghai Volunteer Army joined in the battle on the Tiantong'an side, serving the country and under the command of Army Commander Tsai of the 19th Route Army. Although the firearms were slightly lacking, they charged and fought bravely, with every unit taking the lead. When our army occupied the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters, our volunteer army surrounded a part of the Japanese soldiers, engaged in hand-to-hand combat for a long time, and seized more than 4,000 Japanese guns. They are currently fighting in the Baoshan Road and Hongkou areas.</p>
<h3>The Bitter Battle of the Police Brigade</h3>
<p>This time, the Japanese army</p>
<p>At 11:40 PM on the 28th, riding in armored cars, first clashed with the defense area of ​​our police's 6th Team, firing with machine guns. After the police officers returned fire, they retreated. The team leader, Sun Mou, had previously received a telegram from Regiment Commander Zhang Jun-song, saying that the Japanese side would occupy Zhabei from 11 to 12 tonight. We are soldiers of the Revolutionary Army of the Republic of China, and we should quickly prepare with force to resist the violent and so on. Soon after hearing the news that Jianggou Road had been attacked by the Japanese army, Team Leader Sun immediately led more than 80 members to support it and take decisive measures. To this time, the ferocity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. After fighting for more than an hour, the 1st Battalion and the 5th and 6th Companies of the 6th Regiment of the 78th Division went to support and defeated the Japanese army. Now I know that the team is in charge of the area around Tiantong'an Road, Tongji Road, Jiangwan Road, Qingyun Road, and Hengye Road, which is very important. The spirit of the police officers who have been fighting hard for two days and nights is more inspiring. They also said that fighting against Japan is to win glory for the nation, and they swear to defend the soil with their lives and at any cost.</p>
<h3>Occupying the Des Voeux Road Police Station</h3>
<p>According</p>
<p>I heard that our army attacked at about 4 o'clock yesterday morning, pursued fiercely, and occupied the Des Voeux Road police station. When occupied, the Japanese police in the police station had all withdrawn, and there was no fierce conflict. Post Office</p>
<h3>Business As Usual Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the sudden war broke out on the night of the 28th, Japanese soldiers attempted to occupy the Postal Administration as an operational headquarters, so the post office was once suspended in a serious state. Now that the Japanese soldiers have been defeated and retreated, and there is a lot of accumulated mail, I learned yesterday that the Postal Administration has ordered all branches to work as one, and stipulated the working hours to be observed. The announcement of the Bureau is attached below for reference: As for the announcement, the usual business hours of this Administration during this critical period are tentatively from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. The business hours of other branches are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. All employees must report at the above time and there must be no mistake. If anyone cannot report to the branch due to the suspension of business, they must report to this management office. Do not wait and see and delay yourself. This announcement, January 30, 1932.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Battlefield Inspection in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Our army's vanguard has advanced to the Des Voeux Road. The Japanese army's first line of defense retreats to the Old Rifle Range Road. The Japanese side requests that Tsai [Ting-kai] order the army to stop advancing, but the Japanese army is still constantly approaching our army. The traces of burning in the Zhabei area are still vivid. Our army blocks the Wusongkou. It is difficult for Japanese warships to enter. The reporter set off yesterday morning and risked going to the front lines of the Chinese and Japanese armies in Zhabei to inspect. On the way, he was almost shot and killed by stray bullets from the Chinese and Japanese armies and Japanese plainclothes soldiers. Because he did not avoid difficulties, he learned the most detailed battle situation between the two armies. As of 4:30 to 6:00 PM yesterday evening, our army's vanguard had advanced south to the boundary road and Old Rifle Range Road, and east across North Sichuan Road and Des Voeux Road. The Japanese army's first line of defense retreated to the south of Old Rifle Range Road, and the second line of defense was at Shenjiagou Bay and the Sikaizi Road Bridge. The second line of defense stretched west from Rue de l'Amiens, Haining Road, and Yalu Road to the Hongqiao. The first line of defense was at Pengpu Road, the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market, and the Hongqiao. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties, with only one or two hundred people remaining. Commander Cai Tingkai has now ordered the troops to temporarily stop the attack at the request of the Japanese side, and wait for the Japanese side to withdraw on its own. However, if the Japanese side does not withdraw, our side will still have to attack. The findings of the inspection are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>A Week's Journey</h3>
<p>The reporter started his journey at 10:00 AM yesterday morning, intending to enter the Chinese territory directly from the boundary road, but as soon as he stepped in, stray bullets flew from the east, and he had to change his route, detouring to the west, sneaking across the Suzhou River, and entering directly from Heng Road in Zhabei, passing through Gonghe Road and entering the North Railway Station, to Baoshan Road, because the Japanese were firing rifles in North Henan Road, so he could not cross. Then he changed from Qiujiang Road to Zhongyu Road, from Baotong Road to the Commercial Press, and went north along Baoshan Road to Yokohama Bridge, because there were still Japanese plainclothes soldiers on the right side constantly shooting with rifles, the reporter listened to the advice of the military authorities, and, moreover, it was already half past four, and he had not had any food or drink, so he took the return journey. After returning, he went from North Sichuan Road to Haining Road, passing through the second line of defense of the Japanese army, and was intercepted by Japanese plainclothes soldiers and sailors. Because he turned east and went forward from Kunshan Road, he could not move forward when he reached the Zhabu Road intersection, so he went south to Pengpu Road and turned east, near the Japanese Club (ie, the Japanese Association), and saw about thirty Japanese sailors doing defense engineering. Then he turned back to Dong Wuchang Road and went east, and was detained and interrogated by two Japanese sailors and plainclothes soldiers. It was already 5:20, the interrogation was extremely strict, with guns and knives facing each other, and they said that at this time, a Chinese who could speak foreign languages ​​came here and must be a spy. After searching, fortunately the reporter responded and maneuvered freely and remained calm, and was released. Then he detoured to the Hongqiao and Zhonghongqiao Japanese troop line and completed the inspection and returned.</p>
<h3>Condition of the North Railway Station</h3>
<p>After the reporter entered the Zhabei area, he proceeded along the Beijing-Shanghai Road track from Gonghe Road to the North Railway Station. There were many refugees there. Some came out to see if the war had stopped, and some came out to prepare for escape. There were a lot of people. The reporter first saw a deep hole on the ground beside the track, which was bombed by Japanese aircraft, with a diameter of more than three yards. On its right were locomotive No. C-22 and locomotive No. C-16, connected in two sections. Locomotive No. C-22 was tilted to the southwest due to bombing, but neither locomotive was damaged. From here forward to the back of Shuiting, there was a bomb crater, with a diameter of about six or seven yards and a depth of about six feet. A few dozen paces further ahead, there was a fourth-class car No. P-805, the front part was bombed, and a soldier was killed, lying face down in the car, his right foot was blown off to the south of the car. Further ahead, there were five bomb holes, all very deep and large. Walking near the Hanhan Bridge, there was a row of five armored trains, the front three from the 14th to the 16th were all bombed, with two soldiers burned to death on them. The iron shed car on the left side has been burned down, the fire has not been completely extinguished, and the smell is abnormal. However, the Han Bridge is still as it was. Crossing south of the Han Bridge, the four houses of the Fulun Elementary School, which was killed by the Road Bureau, were all bombed. On its side was locomotive No. C-14, connecting six passenger cars, which were burned down together. Only the chassis and wheels remained. The goods in the remnants of the stalls at the corner of North Zhejiang Road and Xinmin Road were burned down. At the corner of North Zhejiang Road and the boundary road, the defense pavilion next to the iron gate set up by the Municipal Council had no enemies or foreign troops stationed there. The reporter could cross safely when passing through this place. When he approached the platform, he saw that the northern platform and the track under the platform were all bombed. The new houses on the south side, close to the boundary road, were the railway office houses, and the waiting room, ticket office, telegraph room, station master's office, and management office on the front were all bombed. Only the four walls remained. At the same time, the post office cars No. 15983 and 15672, which were parked at the railway department's office, were completely burned down. The rest of the parts are still intact. This is the general situation of the North Railway Station.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road</h3>
<p>When the reporter walked to the intersection of Fushan Road, because there were Japanese sentries on North Henan Road from south to north, shooting from time to time, he dared not go forward on that road. He had to turn west on Qiujiang Road. On the way, the reporter met Platoon Leader Zheng Xie and Pursuit Team Leader Chen Mingqing of our army. There were very few casualties in our army. When the enemy troops came in three routes at midnight on the 28th, with armored vehicles as the vanguard, they thought that our army was unprepared, so they drove straight in and were surrounded by our ambushed machine gun team. Three cars were destroyed. Now the armored car is still at the east end of Qiujiang Road (because the reporter cannot cross Baoshan Road, he did not see it). (The mortar was added to the battle this morning) the 30th (today). The rumbling sound this morning is all the sound of our army attacking the enemy from Zhabei.</p>
<h3>Inspection by Commander Tsai</h3>
<p>Wu Luxun, the battalion commander of the third battalion of the regiment, told reporters that the reason why our army can win this time is because it is willing to sacrifice. The enemy is the invader, and we are the resister. Invaders are often unwilling to sacrifice, and if the resisters do not resist, they will perish. Therefore, everyone puts their lives at risk. Therefore, the Japanese army threw bombs with several planes to bombard our army's line, but it still did not move at all.</p>
<h3>Sketch Map of the War Zone</h3>
<p>The officers at all levels can resist with one heart and one mind. Commander Tsai came to inspect in person yesterday (29th). He ordered us to temporarily stop attacking at the request of the Japanese side and wait for the Japanese soldiers to withdraw on their own. However, if the Japanese army opens fire, we will still return fire. If the Japanese army does not withdraw, we will attack again.</p>
<h3>Burning Circumstances Along the Way</h3>
<p>The reporter inspected west along Qiujiang Road and saw that the fifth district and second branch of the Public Security Bureau was completely bombed. The lumber yard at the entrance of Rulinli on the west side, including about a hundred houses, was completely burned to ashes. However, Lane 1 and 2 of Rulinli and the general lane behind are still intact. Then he turned back and went north along Gongyu Road to Xiangshan Road, Huiwen Road, and most of the houses in the Huzhou Guild Hall were destroyed by artillery fire. On the front, in the west of Rongyeli, a part of the fire was still not extinguished. Then he turned back and went straight along Zhongyu Road, passing through Baotong Road, to the back of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road, and saw that all the buildings of the hall were burned down. At that time, the northeast wind was blowing slowly, and the paper ash and wood ash were blowing in the face, making it almost impossible to open the eyes. Although the fire had been extinguished after the fourth section of the fire department came to the rescue, there was still remaining fire. It was already 2:40. The difficulty of the journey can be imagined.</p>
<h3>The Misery of Burning Lixu</h3>
<p>The library factory of Shangwu School was completely burned, but the Eastern Library opposite it was still intact and unharmed. From the north end of the Commercial Press factory to the front of the tap water pavilion, looking south in awe, the city houses of about Lixu were all scorched earth. The misery was unbearable to watch. Fortunately, Chen Yousheng, the captain of the fourth section of the fire brigade, led more than a dozen members, drove out the fire truck from yesterday morning, and went out to work. As of 3:00 PM yesterday, the completed rescue included the Commercial Press, Xibao Road, Minsheng Hospital at the corner of Zhongyu Road, Tianjili, Guangchangli, Guangjili, and other five or six places.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Yokohama Bridge</h3>
<p>On the night of the 28th, the Japanese army attacked in three routes, each with armored vehicles as the vanguard. The Baoshan Road Yokohama Bridge was the center point for the Japanese army's second and third routes of flank attack, so the situation was more dangerous than other places, and the journey was also very dangerous. The reporter was stopped by the army here. Later, Yin Xiongming, the company commander of the second company of the first battalion of the fifth regiment of the 156th Brigade, and Wei ZhengLin-wan, the company commander of the machine gun company, were both Cantonese. The reporter talked to them in Cantonese and got along very well. Because of this, I was guided to visit our army's line, and I saw that the army in front was very powerful, and some were playing the harmonica for entertainment. In the miserable environment, a pleasant sound suddenly appeared. On the side, there was still a machine gun sound from time to time, and the reporter was not afraid of the misery. From this, I wanted to move forward, but it was not permitted by the military authorities, and it was already four o'clock, so I happily returned.</p>
<h3>Blocking Wusong Against Japan</h3>
<p>According to our military authorities, the Wusongjiang area has been blocked by our army, exclusively for Japan.</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign ships can still enter and exit. Therefore, if Japanese warships come to China, if the Wusongjiang area cannot be entered, the mainland will not be oppressed by it.</p>
<h3>The Garrison Command Announces Martial Law</h3>
<p>Dai Ji, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, issued a notice yesterday, which is hereby announced. According to the investigation, violent Japan used the Mayushan Road incident as an excuse to force us to cancel the anti-Japanese movement, which is very insulting to us. Our municipal government compromised and replied on the afternoon of the 28th. Unexpectedly, the Japanese side issued a note on the same night, demanding that our troops withdraw immediately. Without waiting for a reply, they suddenly attacked us in the Zhabei area. It seems that they disregard international law and undermine peace. Our military police are responsible for defending the country and swear to resist to the death to protect our territory. In order to truly maintain the public order of Songhu, it is hereby announced that martial law will be imposed in the Songhu garrison area from the 29th of this month, and the powers will be exercised in accordance with the martial law regulations.

<h3>Request for Joint Action Against Japan from French Consul</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Association and the Lawyers Association sent a letter to the French Consul-General, stating: "Respectfully, our government, in order to safeguard the safety of Chinese and foreign residents in Shanghai, has reluctantly accepted the four conditions of the violent Japanese. They, intending to seize Shanghai, recklessly provoked the conflict. Although our army has punished them, we have not taken severe measures to respect the order of the concessions. However, the violent Japanese disregard all international constraints and yesterday even threw bombs in your concession, harming Chinese people. We hope that your Consul-General will pay serious attention to these major unfortunate facts and take decisive action if similar incidents occur again. For the violent Japanese are the demons of mankind, not only the enemies of our country. We have specially sent a representative, Wu Mai, to present this matter and hope to be received. Respectfully addressed to the French Consul-General in Shanghai. From the National Salvation Association of the Republic of China, and the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Federation of Trade Unions Requests National Government to Declare War on Japan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions telegraphed the National Government in Nanjing, stating: "To the Nanjing National Government, respectfully: The violent Japanese have already launched a large-scale military operation in Shanghai last night, using all their naval, land, and air forces. Murder and arson are rampant, and the hope of maintaining a peaceful situation is completely lost. Moreover, since the conflict was initiated by them, they bear the responsibility. We humbly request that your government declare war on Japan as soon as possible to save this nation, which is on the verge of death, and its people, who are suffering in deep water and scorching fire. Our Federation is willing to lead all the workers in Shanghai to sacrifice for the country. We offer these tearful words in this urgent telegram, awaiting your orders. Respectfully, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, along with one million workers in the city, kowtows."</p>
<h3>Clash Between Chinese Police and Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Around 6 PM last night, a car suddenly drove along Liao Zhou Road and Roberts Road, carrying about forty armed Japanese marines. Many Chinese police officers were present. Upon seeing the car approaching, they were about to step forward to stop it when the Japanese troops jumped out of the car and opened fire on the Chinese police officers. The officers also drew their guns and returned fire. The outcome is unknown.</p>
<h3>Anti-Aircraft Guns Set Up in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>Due to bombs falling within the concession, yesterday the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession specially set up an anti-aircraft gun on a tall building along the Bund. If necessary, emergency measures may be taken.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Question the Municipal Council Regarding Discussions</h3>
<p>Various organizations, including the National Crisis Relief Association of this city and the National Lawyers Association, believe that the Municipal Council's designation of the northeastern sections of the concession as Japanese defense zones, allowing the Japanese military to easily attack Zhabei, is not conducive to maintaining the security of the concession. Yesterday, they sent representatives, including Wu Mai, to meet with Zhong En, the Director-General of the Municipal Council. Director-General Zhong explained the situation of the Japanese troops' landing as follows: The Municipal Council had protested against the Japanese troops' landing some time ago. Later, the Japanese Consul guaranteed that the Japanese troops would not endanger the security of the concession. However, the current Japanese troops have a predetermined plan and have violated the Japanese Consul's guarantee. Therefore, the Municipal Council has repeatedly protested to the Japanese Consul. As for the Defense Committee of the Municipal Council assigning Japanese troops to garrison in the northeastern sections of the concession, it was in response to the Japanese Consul's request to protect Japanese residents in that area. However, it must be noted that the Defense Committee is responsible for maintaining the security of the northeastern sections of the concession and nothing else. Judging from the current situation in this city, they seem to be using the concession to achieve certain goals. At present, the concession's military force is insufficient to allocate and difficult to correct effectively. If necessary, British troops from Hong Kong and American troops from Manila will arrive in Shanghai sooner or later, and there will be effective maintenance measures. Later, Mr. Wu suggested that the concession authorities immediately replace the Japanese troops in the northeastern sections of the concession with troops from non-enemy countries to avoid prolonging the war and upholding international justice. Otherwise, for the sake of safety, the hundreds of thousands of Chinese residents living in the northeastern sections of the concession occupied by the Japanese troops will have no choice but to request Chinese troops to enter the northeastern sections of the concession garrisoned by the Japanese troops to protect them. This is specially reported.</p>
<h3>Federation of Trade Unions Protests to Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions specially sent representatives Fu Dewei, Zhao Shusheng, Shi Yitang, Li Yongxiang, Long Peiyun, Yu Xianghua, Fan Yifeng, and Weng Ruifu to visit Mr. Feixin Dun at the Municipal Council at 3:30 PM yesterday to request that he uphold justice regarding the Japanese destruction of peace and to quickly stop the Japanese troops from using the excuse of protecting the area north of the Suzhou Creek within the boundary to attack Chinese soldiers. They also conveyed that Chinese citizens, based on past experiences, place particular importance on the fairness of the Municipal Council in this period of conflict compared to normal times. If the Municipal Council suddenly changes its usual conduct, Chinese citizens will have to ask their own government for protection. If any accidents occur as a result, how will the Municipal Council absolve itself of responsibility? Mr. Fei fully accepted this and promised to forward it to the consular corps for consideration.</p>
<h3>University Representatives Visit Fei Xindun Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of Students from various universities in this city, in light of the fact that the Japanese marines are using the Public Concession as a base of operations and the Municipal Council authorities are not stopping them, specially sent representatives Zhou Xiaobo from Fudan University, Wen Guangnan from Nan's Law School, Liu Chuanzhong and Ji Boqing, Sun Jichang from the Sino-French Industrial College, and Ji Shiyuan from the School of Political Science to visit Director-General Fei Xindun at the Municipal Council on Jiangxi Road at 3 PM yesterday to question him. Director-General Fei was out on business and was received by Director Zhong Si. Representative Zhou Xiaobo raised three questions: 1) Since the concession claims to be a neutral zone, why is it allowing the Japanese marines to use it as a base of operations, advancing from the concession and retreating to the concession for protection? 2) Why has the Municipal Council assigned the strategically important Hongkou district to the Japanese army for defense, seemingly providing convenience everywhere? It seems that the concession authorities are showing favoritism towards the Japanese army. 3) The Japanese army is throwing bombs everywhere, and the concession authorities have not yet taken any effective measures to stop this kind of action. Zhong Si answered each point, stating: 1) The responsibility for stopping the Japanese navy from using the Huangpu River as a base lies with the Chinese government. 2) The Municipal Council does not have this kind of control. 3) There have been no instances of Japanese planes dropping bombs in the Public Concession. The representatives then asked, "If such incidents occur in the future, how will the Municipal Council deal with them?" Zhong Si replied, "We are currently discussing it." Finally, Zhong Si also stated that the Japanese army's actions in the past two days have clearly threatened the security of the concession. For its own responsibility, the concession authorities are convening a meeting to discuss a good solution and will not hesitate to take any measures to force the Japanese army to withdraw from the concession if necessary. Zhong Si then left because he was in a meeting. The representatives, feeling that they did not get to the heart of the matter, plan to visit Director-General Fei Xindun again soon for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Japanese Reinforcements Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, five ships arrived with 3,000 marines.</p>
<p>Today, seven more ships arrived with over 30 airplanes.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two naval corps with over 4,000 personnel.</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops in Shanghai challenged us, our national army, for the sake of self-defense, went out to meet the enemy. In the past two days, there have been several fierce battles, with our army winning every time and the Japanese troops retreating step by step. The Japanese army has already been driven out of its original defense positions. Yesterday, the Japanese Naval Ministry said that the marines and air force in Shanghai had been defeated, so it urgently dispatched a large number of warships, fully loaded with munitions, and transferred the entire Sasebo Special Marine Corps, considered the most elite in the country, to Shanghai to fight. Yesterday, a portion of them arrived first. The details of this matter are publicly recorded below.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Six Ships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, there have been twenty-one Japanese warships in Shanghai, all publicly anchored along the Huangpu River in the Yangshupu area. The Japanese army suffered a defeat on the first day of the attack on Zhabei. The Japanese Naval Ministry hastily dispatched four destroyers from the 26th Squadron, led by the cruiser Tatsuta, from Sasebo. When the Tatsuta departed from Japan, it was fully loaded with various cannons, bombs, sulfur bombs for arson, and reportedly also poison gas bombs, which are prohibited by international conventions. The ship also secretly transported a batch to Shanghai for the inhumane slaughter by the Japanese army. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, four destroyers arrived in the Huangpu River first. At 4:30 PM, the Tatsuta also arrived and anchored outside the Huangpu Wharf's customs pier.</p>
<h3>Special Marine Corps Lands</h3>
<p>The Japanese Marine Corps in Shanghai totaled 1,450 personnel, and there were about 1,000 naval personnel from the twenty-one ships. Since the two days of fighting, there have been many casualties. The original Marine Corps has lost most of its strength and its combat power has been greatly reduced. As a result, the Naval Ministry transferred all 7,000 personnel of the Special Naval Corps Marine Corps, which it considered the most elite, to Shanghai. Yesterday, 3,000 personnel arrived first on the Tatsuta, and after arriving in Shanghai at 4:30 PM in the afternoon, they immediately landed at the full Huangpu Wharf to replenish the front lines.</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<h3>Air Force Continues to Arrive</h3>
<p>The aviation corps from the cruiser Notoro recklessly dropped bombs on Zhabei the day before yesterday, bombing shops and civilian houses, and brutally killing innocent people, which was extremely cruel. However, they did not dare to come again after being shot down by our army several times. The Japanese Naval Ministry has telegraphed to transfer all of the First Air Force's combat aircraft. The aircraft carriers Kaga and Hosho, carrying more than 30 aircraft in total, and the cruisers Naka, Kuma, and Abukuma, as well as four first-class destroyers, left Japan yesterday afternoon. The three cruisers will also transport the so-called Special Marine Corps Second Detachment, totaling 4,000 personnel, to Shanghai. They are expected to arrive in Shanghai today, around dusk, to join the battle.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Invade Various Locations</h3>
<p>Japan has decided</p>
<p>to wage war on us, and we are only seeking self-defense. Since the firing in Shanghai, the 23rd Squadron immediately dispatched two ships to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, intending to invade Tongzhou and other places. Yesterday, two more destroyers from the 23rd Squadron were transferred, sailing from the Yangtze River, possibly to Zhenjiang and other places, to disrupt our interior. It is also heard that the Second Squadron sent ships to Haizhou to harass them, but we are all prepared for self-defense. In addition, the corpses of Japanese soldiers killed in action have been publicly loaded by Japanese warships and sent back to their country for cremation.</p>
<h3>Confirmation of Peace in Wusong</h3>
<p>Our reporter stationed in Wusong was unable to transmit news due to the disruption of traffic between Shanghai and Wusong and the disconnection of long-distance telephone lines. He only managed to find a small boat to Shanghai at 10:00 AM yesterday. The details of the situation in Wusong are recorded below. When the Japanese soldiers opened fire on our army on the evening of the 28th, the authorities in Wusong initially received a long-distance telephone report, but the telephone line was disconnected within half an hour. Only communication from Wusong to Jiangwan was possible, thus hindering the transmission of news. At that time, Fortress Commander Deng Zhenquan immediately ordered the North and South Forts and the Lion Forest Fort to be on high alert. Zhong Jingrui, the fourth regimental commander of the 78th Division, ordered his troops to deploy defenses on all important roads. The Yunzaobang Bridge and the railway bridge were both cut off. The Public Security Bureau maintained order in the town, and the entire Self-Defense Force was deployed. By dawn on the 29th, everything was calm. Only faint sounds of gunfire from Shanghai were heard, so the shops remained open for business. However, traffic between Shanghai and Wusong was cut off, so rumors were rampant, and residents were panicked. Some hired boats to move their families or flee to the countryside. In addition to stepping up defenses, the military authorities also set up barbed wire on the roads and constructed solid fortifications. On the commercial side, an emergency meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce at around 7:00 PM to discuss maintaining the current state of the city. There are currently four Japanese destroyers from Shanghai anchored in the waters of the Three Gorges. According to incoming sailboats, there are eight or nine Japanese warships in the waters of Yushan, about a hundred miles away from Wusong, which is likely to cut off the mouth of the Yangtze River. When the reporter left Wusong yesterday, the area was still calm. Japanese warships had passed through without attacking, so the forts had not fired, and the defense was very strong.</p>
<h3>No Trace of Japanese Troops in Bailonggang</h3>
<p>Confirmed Information: Reports from the previous day that Japanese troops had landed in Bailonggang, Chuansha, Pudong, were false. Important transport officials investigated the Donghai beach yesterday and found nothing of the sort. There were troops originally stationed in the Bailonggang area to scout everything. Furthermore, yesterday the Pudong Association sent letters to the relevant counties in Pudong, including Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Shanghai, Baoshan, Songjiang, and Jinshan, to jointly discuss defense to prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Fire After the Odeon</p>
<h3>Japanese Plainclothes Team Starts Fires</h3>
<p>During this invasion of Zhabei's important passes by Japanese soldiers, there was a specially organized Japanese plainclothes team of 500 personnel leading them. This type of plainclothes team was all staffed by Japanese merchants who had been living in Shanghai for a long time. However, after the start of the war, half of them were defeated by our army, and the others fled in all directions, hiding in civilian houses, mostly on Fusheng Road and Gongchuan Road behind the Odeon Theater. There are about thirty or forty people left on Fusheng Road, and they are being searched for and attacked. The fire on Fusheng Road on the night before last (28th) was caused by the extreme cruelty of our army chasing after the plainclothes team in a hurry. The Japanese plainclothes team behind the Odeon Theater also set fire to civilian houses to try to escape when our army was searching and attacking them yesterday afternoon. When the fire started, the people in the area had already fled, so no one helped to put it out. When the concession fire trucks arrived after hearing the news, they were also blocked by Japanese soldiers at the North Sichuan Road Bridge, so the fire spread and expanded until it was slightly subdued at 7:00 PM and extinguished at 8:00 PM, causing great damage.</p>
<h3>Commerce Press Main Factory Burned Yesterday</h3>
<p>General Affairs Department and Editorial Office Fortunately Unharmed</p>
<p>Oriental Library Destroyed in One Corner</p>
<p>The main factory of the Commercial Press and other buildings on Baoshan Road in Zhabei were bombed and burned by Japanese military aircraft, which spread throughout the entire factory. According to Mr. Huang Jingwan of the Commercial Press, the general distribution office received a report from Zhabei yesterday that the old houses, outer stack of books, paper stack, first and second bookbinding rooms, typesetting room, and lead printing department in the north of the factory site were all burned down. Three large cylinder machines were destroyed, and the ink-making department and infirmary were also reduced to ashes. The General Affairs Department of the main factory and the editorial office across the street were unharmed. The Oriental Library was bombed and destroyed in one corner, and not many books inside the library were burned. The total loss is estimated at over two million.</p>
<h3>Location of Japanese Troops and Plainclothes Teams</h3>
<p>Yesterday (30th) morning, Japanese troops and plainclothes teams were deployed in the Hongkou area. North Sichuan Road, from the intersection of Haining Road to the Old Racecourse Road, was entirely Japanese troops. The crowds watching south of the intersection of Haining Road were repeatedly driven towards the Sichuan Road Bridge by Japanese troops. Zha Pu Road, from the Old Racecourse Road to Wuchang Road, was filled with Japanese plainclothes teams, including some Japanese police. Most of the plainclothes teams carried iron bars, long swords, and pistols, with fewer carrying wooden sticks. Between the intersection of Zha Pu Road and Haining Road, because of the Japanese Marine Corps station, sandbags were piled up and a barbed wire fence about ten feet high was erected. A gate was opened in the middle, only passable by vehicles. Wusong Road, Miller Road, Malizhuang Road, East Youheng Road, Yalu Road, and Hongkou Small Vegetable Market all had Japanese plainclothes teams. Except for Wusong Road and Miller Road, traffic was blocked by hemp ropes or iron wires at all road intersections. However, when Japanese people passed by, the plainclothes teams would lift the hemp ropes or iron wires to allow them to pass unhindered. However, there were few Chinese people on those roads, and most of the crowds watching were in the Wuchang Road area. Between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM, vehicles were allowed to pass through the areas where the Japanese plainclothes teams were located, but they were checked very closely. Every six or seven steps, or ten or eight steps, there would be a plainclothes team shouting loudly to stop them for inspection. The inspection of cars was especially strict. The Japanese soldiers also used sharp weapons against people. Also, around 12:00 PM, about thirty Japanese plainclothes teams gathered at the entrance of Hengshanli on Haining Road. Japanese plainclothes teams often went to patrol the nearby neighborhoods, paying the most attention to the residences of Cantonese people. Therefore, all the residents on Haining Road to the Old Racecourse Road had moved out before yesterday (30th) morning.</p>

<h3>Falsely Accusing Innocent People of Being Prisoners</h3>
<p>Non-Judicial Assault</p>
<p>Inhuman</p>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese troops suddenly searched every household in the North Sichuan Road area, causing a great disturbance, and falsely accused innocent people of being prisoners, arbitrarily torturing and killing them. According to a report from a witness to the atrocities, the Japanese army broke through the iron fences of North Sichuan Lane on North Sichuan Road yesterday morning and destroyed the gate and back door of Jiande Apartments, occupying the stove used to boil water behind the apartments as a temporary prisoner collection point. At the same time, they led translators and plainclothes teams to rush into the front and back doors of North Sichuan Lane to search every household. They arrested more than twenty men, three women, and seven children. A translator even took thirty yuan in cash from the woman's side. All of them were detained in the stove. The men were stripped of their clothes and thoroughly searched. About half an hour later, the Japanese army released the women and children, while the men were taken by the Japanese Marine Corps in a car to the ruined walls of the Commercial Press (Photographed by Li Zunyong)</p>
<p>headquarters next to the Fukumin Hospital, a Japanese elementary school, and taken to the interrogation room on the second floor to be interrogated. At that time, there were three or four Chinese coolies inside, with blood all over their faces and their hands tied behind their backs, in a very miserable state. They were immediately ordered to sit cross-legged on the ground. One of them, wearing a Western suit, attracted the most attention from the Japanese army and was questioned for a long time. The person was from Guangdong and did not understand Shanghai language. When the interrogation yielded no results, he was forced to put his hands on the ground and straighten his feet for about twenty minutes, with his abdomen not allowed to touch the ground, otherwise, he would be beaten with a stick. Then, each person was strictly interrogated. The interrogation was completed in one hour, and a tragedy occurred. At that time, several Japanese soldiers brought in a prisoner, dressed like a worker, but the Japanese army insisted that he was a Chinese plainclothes team member, tore off his clothes, and beat his whole body with a thick rope two inches in diameter. Although he denied it forcefully, they still did not stop. They also used wooden baseball bats to strike his arms fiercely. He rolled around on the ground, wailing miserably. At that time, the person in Western clothes was already sitting cross-legged on the ground. The Japanese army smiled and went forward, ordering him to stand up quickly and raise his hands, lest he should have other thoughts. And wooden sticks rained down on his back. He was in extreme pain and fainted to the ground. At twelve o'clock, the Japanese army drew a black circle on the hands of the remaining people with an ink brush and wrote the Arabic numeral "1" inside the circle, and then led them to the opposite prisoner room, where there were already more than ten people, all with the Arabic numeral "11" written on their hands. The Japanese army held a large paper book, the cover of which was the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters, with the words "executed (i.e., shot)" and "detained (i.e., detained)" on it. They ordered those with the number "8" to be released and go downstairs. Then, several plainclothes teams beat them arbitrarily with wooden sticks. And the last Chinese coolie was on the list of those to be executed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Shell the Red Cross Society</h3>
<p>The International Red Cross and the Chinese Red Cross Society are neutral organizations recognized by all countries. According to the Geneva Convention, they are allowed to rescue seriously wounded soldiers and civilians during wartime. On the 28th, Wang Zhenchuan, secretary and physician of the Chinese Red Cross Society, and others went to the railway station to rescue several wounded soldiers. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Qi Xiaqing, along with volunteer rescuers Dong Xinqin, volunteer physician Zhang Zhujun, and other nurses and laborers, entered the station from the back door of the Aimenjin Road and the Yike Inn, and went out through the front door, intending to go to the railway station to transport wounded soldiers. First, they waved two Red Cross flags, but when the Japanese soldiers saw the Red Cross flags appear, they fired two bullets westward from the intersection of Old Racecourse Road and Baoshan Road. Dong and others quickly retreated and lay down, so they were not hit. The Chinese army quickly waved to the Red Cross Society, telling them not to move forward. In all countries, troops who have received education never shoot at the Red Cross flag. Yesterday, the Japanese army destroyed the wounded soldier's car with the Red Cross flag with a bomb, and now they are shooting at the Red Cross rescue team. If they had received a little education, they would never do this. I wonder what the allied countries that signed the Geneva Convention will do?</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Kill and Injure Innocent Chinese</h3>
<p>The Shanghai</p>
<p>Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the Hongkou district was in a state of complete panic last night because Japanese plainclothes teams were densely deployed in the area, so Chinese police officers were not on duty. Yesterday (30th) afternoon, one police officer was beaten by Japanese people, and two others were disarmed. Two yellow people were beaten, and two Chinese were beaten to death with sticks and other weapons. The Japanese reserve force now completely controls the area, assisted by the Marine Corps, claiming to maintain order while searching Chinese pedestrians. Yesterday morning at 3:15 AM, several senior police officials were stopped by 150 Japanese plainclothes teams, who were in a fierce mood. Fortunately, they were able to calm them down through negotiation and avoid being beaten. Last night, a group of Japanese plainclothes teams humiliated two British people and beat a Chinese person near Haining Road and Zha Pu Road, accusing him of being a plainclothes soldier. Foreigners who tried to dissuade them with a gentle attitude were also beaten, and one of them was severely injured by an iron bar and a baseball bat. Fortunately, a special police officer nearby rescued him and took him to safety. He stayed at the Hongkou Police Station for two hours and was escorted to the car parked on North Sichuan Road by a Japanese escort team. In the afternoon, two Chinese police officers from the Hongkou Police Station were disarmed by Japanese people when they met on the road. Another Chinese police officer from Jing'an Temple was also disarmed and beaten when he passed the Japanese Club on Peng Road and dragged into the club. It was heard that he was later escorted to the Japanese military headquarters. During the commotion, the Japanese fired a shot. Yesterday afternoon, two Chinese people were severely beaten by Japanese people at the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market, and one of them died from his injuries. Yesterday morning at 3:00 AM, four Japanese Marine Corps patrol soldiers chased a Chinese pedestrian on Suzhou Road, intending to search him. The Chinese man jumped into the river in desperation, and his body was found at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Continental Times reported that it had received several reports of Japanese Marine Corps massacring Chinese civilians yesterday. An American, Messeli, who lived at No. 142 Sichuan Road, witnessed a young Chinese man being dragged out of his residence at No. 774 North Sichuan Road and killed by Japanese soldiers. There were six people in his family. Five other Chinese people were arrested by Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Arbitrarily Arrest Store Employees</h3>
<p>Hongkou</p>
<p>At 6:00 AM yesterday, the Taiyu Cigarette and Paper Store at Nos. 142 and 143 Wusong Road had eleven of its employees taken away by the Japanese, including the money manager Li Qianweiqing, employees Huang Dongchu, Chen Shijian, Qian Dayuan, Zhou Shaoqi, Fan Zhicun, Zhang Rongfu, Sha Yutong, Hu Qingxiang, an apprentice, and an outsider. Although the police station was notified to investigate, their whereabouts are still unknown. There is still a Japanese plainclothes team guarding the entrance of the store. The loss of goods cannot be estimated. Although it is in Baipeng, the electric lights are still not turned off, and the signboard is broken beyond recognition.</p>
<h3>Japanese Harassment of Soochow University</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that at 1:00 AM this morning (30th), Japanese ronin broke into the Law School of Soochow University at No. 11 Kunshan Road, destroying chairs, desks, utensils, doors, and windows, and beating the servants. Then, they went to the Second Middle School of Soochow University across the street to do the same. Soochow University is run by the Methodist Episcopal Church South of the United States. After the ronin left, the servants reported to Dr. Hoxie, the head of the church, who said that the ronin were all carrying sticks and guns, led by a Japanese sailor. Dr. Hoxie now has a red and white band worn by the Japanese as evidence and will report the matter in detail to the American Consul General in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Compatriots Beware of Conspiracy</h3>
<p>According to reports yesterday, there is</p>
<p>a shocking piece of news that Chinese refugees often encounter Japanese plainclothes teams who approach them, point their guns at their heads, and force them into their offices, strip them of their clothes, and replace them with Japanese clothing. Then, they kill the Chinese, gouge out their eyes, transport them out in cars, and throw them into the river. When the corpses float up, they are pointed out as evidence of Chinese using cruel means to murder Japanese civilians. If this is true, the design is extremely poisonous. I hope that our compatriots will pay close attention.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul Notifies Japanese Residents to Board Ships</h3>
<p>The Consul General of Shanghai, Murai Kuramatsu, urgently notified the Japanese residents in the Hongkou area at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday to move to the warships before 8:00 PM. As of 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the Japanese residents had been evacuated. Seeing this, the Chinese people nearby also took their families and fled to the concessions, causing panic and a serious situation.</p>
<h3>Middle School Federation Summons Students Back to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Middle School Students' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation held its 15th executive committee meeting at its office in Jiping Lane, Ximen, at 2 PM yesterday.

(1) Telegram to the National Government: To the National Government and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek and Mr. Wang Jingwei in Nanjing: As the two gentlemen enter the capital, we celebrate that the central government has a leader. However, the Japanese army suddenly attacked and destroyed North Shanghai, and only the 19th Route Army is fighting alone. After three days, the enemy's reinforcements have gathered, but our government and the troops from various routes in Nanjing and Hangzhou sit idly by without rescue. The 19th Route Army has limited personnel and military supplies. If reinforcements are not quickly increased and military supplies are not replenished, the entire Shanghai population will be trapped by the enemy. You bear the heavy responsibility of the country. How can you explain yourselves to future generations? We urgently call for help and hope for mobilization. The Shanghai Lawyers' Association respectfully bows, the 30th. (2) Notice to Members and the Public: This time, the Japanese army invaded our territory. Fortunately, the 19th Route Army bravely defended the country and preserved our territory. All citizens should provide assistance and encouragement to these loyal and brave soldiers. Members of the Association and people from all walks of life who wish to donate cash or war supplies can have the Association collect and transfer them. The collection locations are as follows: (1) The Association at No. 572, the intersection of Julu Road and Route Lafayette. (2) Lawyer Lu Jia at No. 543, Xinyu Lane, Meibaige Road. (3) Lawyer Li Zuyu at Lianzhu Lane, Avenue Haig. (4) Lawyers Shen Junru and Zhang Yaozeng at Datong Lane, Baker Road. Receipts with the Association's seal will be issued for all cash and goods received.</p>
<p>French Concession</p>
<h3>Stores Closing Early</h3>
<p>According to the Da Mei Evening News, it is reported that the French police have verbally notified all stores, taverns, and theaters in the concession to close early every night. Public places such as cafes, restaurants, and tea houses are also ordered to close at 8 PM.</p>
<p>The Enthusiasm for Comfort from All Sides</p>
<h3>Our Army Urgently Needs Transportation Equipment</h3>
<p>Recent news from the Headquarters states that most of the comfort goods from all walks of life are food. While these are needed by the military, there is a redundancy because they are somewhat similar. What the military needs most at the moment are trucks, gasoline, motorcycles, running shoes, and medicines. We hope that zealous compatriots will donate as much as possible. As for donating cash, it is difficult to keep track of and use it to reward the troops, it may only increase the soldiers' attachment to wealth and fear of death. The morale is extremely high at the moment, and they have already put their lives on the line, so money is not a concern.</p>
<h3>Notice to Those Sending Comfort Items</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, due to the patriotic performance of the 19th Route Army in resisting the enemy, which has brought glory to the nation, has been receiving numerous donations of comfort items in recent days, but there is no way to deliver them. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a special notice to all sectors that all items donated to the army will be collected on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce at the Hong Kong ###</p>
<h3>Comfort Groups Delivering Food to the Front Lines) Photo by Li Zunyong (</h3>
<p>Road Bankers Association. It is noted that the army has been in contact with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and representatives are sent daily to negotiate everything. Yesterday, it was reported that the army's office established in the New World had been cancelled.</p>
<h3>Comfort Goods Can Be Sent to the Red Cross Headquarters</h3>
<p>Feng Yi, the squad leader of the 6th Police Squad, was ordered to be dispatched to the rear defense. Appreciating the difficulty of supplies at the front, he purchased a large batch of bread yesterday to supply the front squad. It is now reported that people from all walks of life are enthusiastically preparing supplies to carry to the front to comfort the soldiers. However, those who feel that the long journey is arduous and inconvenient due to the military zone can write down which troops the supplies are for and have the Chinese Red Cross General Headquarters on Haig Road forward them to the front.</p>
<h3>Comfort Food Piled Up Like Mountains</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce announced the news of collecting cash and goods to comfort the soldiers at the front lines, public groups and individuals have been enthusiastically donating cash and goods since yesterday morning. At the Bankers Association on Hong Kong Road alone, items have been piled up like mountains.

<h3>Current Situation of the Public Concession Court</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu</p>
<p>High Court's Second Branch and the Shanghai First Special District Local Court are both located on North Zhejiang Road, not far from the North Railway Station. Therefore, since the 28th night, more than ten members of the International Volunteer Corps of Britain, the United States, and other countries have been fully armed to protect the court. On the same night, military telephones were installed, posts were arranged, and defense was maintained overnight. Until the next day, the 29th night, due to the increasingly fierce fighting on the North Station side and in view of the Japanese army's indiscriminate bombing and arson everywhere during the day, in order to prevent any eventuality, all the water suction belts prepared in the court were connected to the court's water faucets, and the patrolling of the members inside and outside the court became stricter. Until yesterday, the alert had not been relaxed. The iron gate facing Qipu Road remained closed all day, and the gate facing North Zhejiang Road was only opened when cars entered or exited. Those who went to the two courts for official business all entered and exited from the side door next to the main gate. In front of the door, in addition to the armed members and armed Indian police standing guard, two policemen were also dispatched to strictly interrogate those entering and exiting. As for the staff of the two courts,</p>
<p>they still worked as usual. However, Judge Shen Bingrong resided in the city and could not come to the court due to the blocked transportation. Other staff and servants whose families were in the Chinese area were also temporarily unable to come to the court. Fortunately, the police stations have solved very few cases in the past three days, and no major cases have occurred, so the court feels more leisurely than in the past.

<p>Wu Genli, a resident of Yangzhou who escaped from the Shenjiawan battlefield in Zhabei yesterday morning, said that he has parents, a wife, and daughters, and used to live in Shenjiawan, Zhabei. After hearing the news of the deterioration of the situation in this port on the morning of the 28th, he immediately went alone to pick them up, intending to move to the concession for temporary refuge. On the same day, there was not enough time to arrange things, so until 11 PM at night, the war had already started, and he could not return. The place was right on the front line, and he personally saw the police of the Public Security Bureau desperately resisting. Stray bullets were like a torrential rain, and the residents were terrified. The next morning, two Japanese planes flew to the area to drop bombs, and the flight was very low, so that one plane was shot down by our army's rifles, and the pilot was killed on the spot. Then the other plane did not care about anything and dropped bombs indiscriminately. One bomb landed on the thatched house opposite Wu's house. Fortunately, it did not explode, otherwise the whole family would have been turned into powder. After that, he tried several times to escape from the tiger's mouth, but it was never his wish. At about 6 AM yesterday morning, five policemen retreated to rest, but all the policemen were panting like cows, sweating profusely, and were already exhausted, having not eaten a grain of rice for two days and one night. Only this morning (yesterday morning) did they give up their lives to escape the battlefield, and crossed the Henan River at a price of one yuan and four jiao per person, and the whole family finally celebrated their survival. When he spoke, a kind of startled state made people shudder.</p>

The Central Executive Committee and Wang Jingwei believed that Sun Ke had previously firmly resigned as President of the Executive Yuan, which had been approved, and Wang was re-elected to succeed him as President of the Executive Yuan, and Sun was reassigned as President of the Legislative Yuan. The other day, a telegram was sent urging him to go to Nanjing to take up his new post so that comrades could gather together to resist foreign aggression. Sun still telegraphed yesterday to politely decline on the grounds that he was not familiar with the legal system. The following is a transcription of the incoming and outgoing telegrams:</p>
<h3>Central Government Telegram</h3>
<p>Sun Zhe Sheng Mr. C鑑, The Central Standing Committee elected you as President of the Legislative Yuan last night. The Shanghai War has begun, and the Central Government has decided to resist with all its strength to protect this country's territory and sovereignty. Our party bears the responsibility for this survival. It is difficult to consolidate the center and promote the whole country unless all the central comrades gather in the capital and swear to defend it to the death. Please immediately invite the central comrades in Shanghai to come to Nanjing immediately to support the dangerous situation. I am extremely grateful and hope for it. Central Executive Committee 艶午,</p>
<h3>Sun Ke's Reply Telegram</h3>
<p>Nanjing Central Executive Committee 鈞鑒, Upon reading the 艶電, I respectfully learned that the Central Standing Committee elected Ke as the President of the Legislative Yuan. I feel that my talent and strength are short-sighted, and I am not familiar with the legal system. I am frightened and dare not accept the order. I sincerely hope that you will understand the situation and quickly cancel this resolution and select someone who is virtuous and capable to avoid mistakes. This is what I urgently pray to. In this time of national crisis, all party members feel that they have a duty to work hard. Ke has secret opinions and abilities, and he should contribute them at any time for selection. Sun Ke bows 卅酉,</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Telegram</h3>
<p>Sun Zhe Sheng Mr. 動鑒, At 10:00 last night, the Central Temporary Meeting decided to approve your resignation from the post of President of the Executive Yuan and reassign you as President of the Legislative Yuan, and to have your brother succeed as President of the Executive Yuan. This time, my brother came to Nanjing to assist you, but now the Japanese army has started trouble in Shanghai. In times of emergency, no matter what responsibility, my brother dare not refuse. I have already taken office this morning. I respectfully ask my brother to think about the dangers of the party and the country and that there is no time to lose. Please come to Nanjing immediately to work together to face the national crisis. The urgent telegram is pressing, please understand. Your brother 逃兆銘 艶巳,</p>
<h3>Sun's Telegram</h3>
<p>Nanjing Wang Jingwei Advance 鑒, I have received the 艶巳 telegram, and I am pleased to learn that the Central Government has decided to approve my resignation and elected you to succeed as President of the Executive Yuan. From now on, the center will be stable and responsible, and only you can save the crisis. Even if I resign, I will not forget to use my position as an outsider to contribute to your help. I secretly believe that in this moment of national crisis, the Central Government should make the greatest determination, not yield to foreign countries, be self-reliant internally, and provide full support to the soldiers who are loyal and brave in resisting aggression, and try to accommodate the opinions of comrades who hold different opinions, so that the situation of unity and unity will surely be realized. As for reassigning me as the President of the Legislative Yuan, I really dare not accept the order, because the matter of the legal system is not my strength. In this time of crisis and survival, it is not the time to deal with it calmly. I urge you to submit to the Central Government to cancel this resolution and select someone who is virtuous and capable. This is what I urgently pray to. Your brother 科 卅酉,</p>
