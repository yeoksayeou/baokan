<h3 id="c1">續借美麥問題　肖梅 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>去歳。以賑災故。曾向美國借運大批小麥及麥粉。總噸數爲五十九萬三千餘短噸。（每短噸爲二千磅。合一千五百斤。即十五担。）價値美金一千四百十一萬餘元。此項美麥。直接用於救濟難民。收效雖不甚著。而間接用以築堤防災。則爲效有足多者。今歳狃於去歳之成功。又有續借美麥四十五萬噸之議。</p>
<p>且有不日即將簽訂合同之說。衆口喧騰。甚囂塵上。而美國人士則又力加否認。諉爲美國大選中之宣傳。不能見諸事實。故其眞相如何。尙難捉摸。惟事關民食。不容忽視。爰根據統計報告。略陳其利害焉。</p>
<p>去歳洪水泛濫。遍地哀鴻。始有借運美麥之議。美麥借運之不足。復有大批糧食之進口。計米達一千零七十四萬餘担。價値六千四百三十七萬餘海關兩小麥達二千一百三十七萬餘担。價値八千二百零九萬餘海關兩。麫粉四百零八萬餘担。價値二千四百九十萬餘海關兩。總計三千六百二十餘萬担。價値一萬七千一百餘萬海關兩。爲數之鉅。爲我國從來所未有。素以農業立國之國家。竟有如此糧食入超之現象。不亦大可慨乎。</p>
<p>今歳秋收豐稔。長江各省多苦米穀過剩。米價慘跌。幾有江河日下之勢。穀賤傷農。事有必至。農民所受經濟之壓迫。其悲慘恐不亞於凶歳。在此嚴重情况之下。方將拒絕外國糧食入口之不暇。豈可再借美麥以助長我國糧食過剩之危機促成農村之崩潰乎。美國本苦於糧食過剩。雖以飼牲畜。甚至投諸祝融。抛諸海洋。亦在所不恤。今得此大批出路。在美國固何樂而不爲。而我則本國所産。方患供過於求。若再益以外麥傾銷。勢必市况愈疲。或至無人過問。藉曰借儲美麥以備荒。然備荒宜以米而不宜以麥。更宜以我國過剩之米。而不宜以美國過剩之麥。豐年積穀。事至便利。何待他求。此又事理之顯而易見者也。况就美麥之價格而論。去歳所借美麥。每一短噸約合美合美金二十元有零。益以運費保險費等。每噸共合美金二十四。元之譜。以美金一元合國幣五元計。爲一百二十元。即每担合八元左右有餘。較之市價約高出百分之三十。尚須付以四厘之利息。此次擬借之美麥。其條件是否與去歳相同。吾人雖未明内容。難以懸斷設若一仍舊貫。則此四十五萬噸美麥。爲値當爲美金一千二百萬元。合國幣六千萬元。每担約九元左右。比之市價。約須捐失國幣二千萬元。</p>
<p>直接與財政以鉅大之創傷。間接與人民以意外之負担果何需而出此耶。再退一步而言。備荒要政急不容緩。雖受任何損失亦在所不顧。然而麥之爲物。非可久儲。必須不斷流通。以新易陳。否則將腐變而不可用。法歳所借美麥。已有不適於製粉之弊。至不得不貶價求售。是急賑且不適用。更何論於備荒乎。我人追溯旣往。悚念未來。美麥續借之議。終期期以爲不可。甚願其所傳之非眞也。</p>

<p>國聯調查團報告書發表了之後、日本人表面上非常激怒、對調查團（甚至於對國聯）盡量攻擊、由攻擊而謾駡、即使穩當、點的主張、也要　撤回九·十兩章、重新調查一次、就表面上看、日本全國的輿論眞是一致、這個國家眞有新銳的氣像、但是我們叩之實際、加以詳細的調查、就知道這件事！輿論的一致還有多少疑問、　原來國聯調查團報告書發表之前、對於報告書的内容、日本就大體已經明白、早作了準備、軍部站在前頭、對　屬下所有的組織、如「在鄉軍人會」「國本社」「黑龍會」「行地社」等等團體、呌、們一齊準備動員、到了報告書發表的時候、就由軍部亂敲警鐘、并指令各師團長發動當地在鄉軍人、指令各地報紙作所調動一致的輿論、同時、更提起牠所建造的「滿洲」傀儡國、用「三千萬民衆」的名義、發起對報告的反駁、牠所謂輿論是：（從東西兩朝日新聞以至萬朝報、和其他各種雜誌都採取相同的論調、）</p>
<p>（一）他們都對報告書第一章表示相當的好意、因爲牠說到中國還不算一個近代國家、并且幾乎每個人作文章都引用「可見中國内部之分裂勢力、尙屬强盛、此種缺乏團結力之原因、實由於大多數國民只知有家族鄉土、而不知有國、僅在基本國與他國外交情勢非常緊張時、乃稍有感覺耳」、他們所以常引這一段的意義、是坐實他們的主張中國並未形成近代國家、可以任隨軍國主義之侵略、</p>
<p>（二）他們以爲從國聯以至國聯所派出來　調查團、對於過去的中國與夫「滿洲」都缺乏實際的知識、所以報告書的理論都是些紙上空談、並没有實際接觸到問題的核心、於是給報告書一個判語、呌做「認識不足」、</p>
<p>（三）由這種認識不足出發、調查團認爲日軍的行動、特别是九一八的軍事行動之超出自衛範圍以外這件事的判斷是不公正的、至於認日本包藏得有領土野心、基於這種領土野心、而發出軍事的侵略行爲、那就更是誤解中之誤解了、</p>
<p>（四）事變的爆發、在調查團認爲日本超出自衛手段以外、而「滿洲國」的發生、也不是自發的、而是日本軍隊和官吏的活動、他們更以爲這是誣妄、不過對於滿洲的特殊性（即對日本的特殊和經濟利益）加以明晰的說明、他們還認爲不錯、</p>
<p>（五）對九·十兩章解决的條件和建議、他們都認爲這算是違反他們所謂的事實、這個事實就是所謂傀儡國的獨立、又經日本的承認、并且派出了（武裝）在使、所以他們說「報告書是空虛的理論、是一種旅行記、違背了事實等等、」於是日本政府（簡直就可以說是日本軍部罷）就依據　自己所製造的輿論、根據牠所發動的（傀儡的）民意、對國聯作出意見書、日本代表所持方針是：</p>
<p>『一、（日本）帝國政府之正式承認「滿洲國、」乃旣嚴肅的執行其國策、無論遭遇任何事態、决不取消其承認、　不（變更）其承認之性質、故國聯之議論須在我（日本）承認事實之下、以不動「滿洲國（？）」獨立爲前題而進行（討論）、</p>
<p>一、燥進之抗爭、足以招致最惡之事態、故當然應避免之、并應力盡恊調精神、以圖圓滿解决、然（日本）帝國之正當主張、如與國聯主張相對立、而陷於無妥協之餘地時、則應表明帝國之立塲、立即斷然退出國聯、</p>
<p>一、（日本）帝國政府對李頓報告書之見解、已於意見書中明細開示、尤須加以懇切的說明、即滿洲事變當時無論任何國家當之、均不能在日本所取行動之外、另取他種行動、此種態度應求國聯之充分諒解、』</p>
<p>這一點大綱、固然還不足以表明日本的輿論、但是可以表現「御製」的輿論、因爲眼前日本的報紙和其他的定期刊物、都在軍部侵略狂熱情感支配之下、找不到什麽東西是輿論、所以稍微頭腦清楚一點的人、如像佐佐弘雄也覺着太過於狂熱了、即是蠟山政道也覺著盡量否定中國没有國家的組織、結果弄得「滿洲國」眞不能獨立（即無異自己承認滿洲國是日本製造的…、）向坂逸郎以爲日本最近的言論自由極其狹小、似乎没有說話的餘地、没有法子多說話、不過他也看清楚了調查團報告書織進去了國際帝國主義的複雜關係、細田民樹以爲『李頓報告書是暗示着把中國置諸國際共管之下、特别是「滿洲」要公平的分割、日本軍閥雖然看（李頓報告書）不過是一册亞洲旅行記、但是究竟實際、到底是個「中國分割指南針、」是列强要分割中國的開端、』誠然這節話似乎是有點兒過火、但他却窺破了帝國主義的心理、就日本方面講、内田康哉（外相）旣賭「我（日本）縱然變成焦土…」亦必爭取東北、則一切的輿論、一切的外交手腕、都成無用了、（十月二十四日於東京）</p>

<p>敎學指導的意義、非常複雜、分析起來、可得下列三方面、（一）普通以爲敎學指導不過是學校敎學狀况、各方面的視察、如敎學的設備、敎學的方法、敎師和學生的活動、以及其他可爲敎學效率的各種條件、這是敎學指導的最初步的意義、但在中國、敎學指導能把這一步做得周到、似乎已屬難能可貴了、（二）以爲敎學指導是在職敎師的訓練、所以使敎師擴張敎育學識、增進敎育技術、鼓勵服務精神、這意義不消說比較進步了、因爲根據這意義、指導員不只是一個視察者、還須獲得敎師的信仰與合作、輔助敎師的敎學改進、所以敎學指導的範圍也較爲擴展了、（三）以爲敎學指導的目的在改進敎學的各方面、如數學目標的釐定、敎材的選擇和組織引起動機、適應個性、指導學習等敎學方法、以信敎室内温度·光線·通氣·和坐位等物質條件在這裏、敎學指導的意義更爲進步、更爲擴展、指導員不單是一個敎學的視察者、或敎師的訓練者、還須是個敎育研究的專家、負敎學各方面改進的全部責任、上述敎學指導意義的三方面、也可說是敎學指導意義擴展的三個階段、在美國敎學指導的實際差不多已進展到第三階段、而在我國却仍停留在第一階段内、所以如何增進敎學指導的效率如何改變敎學指導的方面、確是我國敎育行政的當前問、兹根據作者平日的觀察所得、今後的敎學指導、似該從下列幾個方面努力、</p>

<p>三十八比三十六分</p>
<p>楊樹浦一塲籃球戰</p>
<p>丨援助東北義軍丨</p>
<p>滬江大學籃球隊、昨晚以二分擊敗連年稱雄海上之西青海賊隊、結果爲三十八比三十六、楊樹浦該校籃球房中、上上下下、水洩不通、大都爲該校男女學生、售票所得、將悉數匯往東北、接濟義軍、由彭三美執行裁判、</p>
<p>滬江未臻美境　滬江之表演、雖不能謂令人失望、然尙未臻佳美之境、合作工夫、似可進步、上場之十分鐘、雙方皆慌亂異常、只見人馬亂奔、互相瞎撞、人後雖漸鎭定、球勢頓歸呆滯、射籃之不準備、最爲失望、對方犯規七次、僅僅由馮念華罰中二分、前鋒之中、仍以馮最可取、後衛平平、在季節方開始之時、自不能求之太苛、須知對方爲强勁之敵人也、</p>
<p>海賊始終可怕　昨晚可謂海賊最减色之一晚、籃下擲射之差分十六、中者數不可許、史密斯僅中二球、可謂大可矣、其原因塲地之生疏爲其一、場之四角因樓面太低關係、非習於此者不能射、運球之速、滬江不如、機會多於滬江、射之不中、亦運氣之差、實力可怕、决不能因此一敗而輕之、</p>
<p>上塲形勢緊張　上場時、球勢迅速、極度緊張、史密斯於亂戰一陣後、首先命中、滬江以八比三超出、海賊以十比十追上、不幸此時大史規亞因孫寳慶之一撞微傷出、西青反而受罰、於是呈露動摇、但仍維持各十四各十六之平手、滬江經馮念華之二球、孫寳慶之一射、上半時以二十二比十六勝六分、</p>
<p>海賊一念之差　休息後再戰、滬江於二分鐘之中、一連中的二項、一中再中、以三十四比十九大勝十五分、緊張之局面、漸歸和定、海賊似有嫌裁判之偏袒、大有任有其所之之態此一念之差、遂坐令失敗、</p>
<p>幾乎和局完塲　海賊之不經心　滬江亦隨而鬆弛、兩方行動、時見粗躁海賊於此時遂乘機上進、分數累積、三十六八比三十二僅差落後六分、離完場尙有二分鐘、白那特史規亞、果然加上四分、僅差二分矣、滬江籃下無人、白那特單人射擲、竟告不中、一轉瞬終局、滬江乃以三十八比三十六獲勝、</p>

<p>一對夫婦抱個小孩來拜望相老人。相老人就對他們說：你們的好小孩，在十歳内就要操練體格，將來身體健旺，才算大中華的國民！因爲照現在的國難情形，推算下去，恐怕要引起「三民」共管啊！一是歐洲人民，二是美洲人民，三是那所謂倭民，都要來欺凌我們了！因此我記好了下面重要主張。</p>
<p>相老人曾提及他創辦震旦復旦時，就聘敎官授兵操，學生還要實習打靶。他記得很清楚，有一次，邵力子連發三槍連中三槍！相老人談起很高興，不知現在邵先生忘了這件得意事没有？</p>
<p>所以主張的理由，不僅唱舉國皆兵：因爲兵法部勒子弟，能呌國民有探險冒險的精神，和運用體質的精力。那麽實行辦法，又怎様呢？略述一述。</p>
<p>學界，工界，商界，下半天有工夫：所以下午五時至七時，或者，六時至八時，可以會操。</p>
<p>農界上半天可會操：因爲常能早起，早至上午五時至七時，或者，六時至八時。</p>
<p>男子年十六至四十，有擔任徵兵的義務；十五六歳，中學或高小畢業後，有練習一年兵操的義務。</p>

<p>丨紅樓夢與啼笑因緣作崇丨</p>
<p>記得程小青先生曾經親口告訴我過，他得某一徧作品在報紙上按日披刊的時候，有一位女敎員，每天把這報紙積藏起來，一天伊偶然遺失了一張，氣得這一天不曾吃飯。可見偵探小說迷人的力量，委實不小，和武俠小說的迷人力量一般的偉大，可是言情小說，却更比較容易敎人着迷了。以下是兩位着了言情小說迷的故事。</p>
<p>一位我只知伊是姓沈，因爲是我家鄰居，伊家裏稱呼伊二小姐，伊愛讀紅樓夢，平時常可以聽到伊在朗聲背誦紅樓夢的曲子和詩詞，前年伊嫁了。還在新婚的蜜月中，就有住在伊婆家附近的一個親戚，傳來了有趣的消息，原來伊在結婚不過一星期後的一天，伊們新夫婦倆，把新房的門關了，伊伏在床上嗚嗚的哭，越哭越悲哀，并且越哭越響了。伊的公婆聽得新媳婦在哭，只當做自己的兒子，在怎様欺侮伊，忙趕去命他們開了房門，進去問原委，他兒子却笑嘻嘻地回答：「伊在裝林黛玉，敎我學了賈寳玉去勸伊罷了，没有别的事。」伊公婆爲伊是新媳婦，自然原諒了伊，但是也不覺啞然失笑了。自此伊的妯娌們，都喚伊「痴小姐。」</p>
<p>還有一位是我從前母校裏女同學，伊被「啼笑因緣」的小說迷了。在今年的春季裏，伊嫁給了我的一位同事，這位同事正是一位翩翩美少，伊眼光中把他眞比得啼笑因緣中的樊家樹，平常把何麗娜自居，有時我到他家去，便把「樊先生　和「何小姐」稱呼他們爲笑樂。可是伊眞有趣，稱呼我「陶先生」，原來伊把我也硬凑了陶伯和的脚色。明星公司的「啼笑因緣」影片公映以後，我去邀了他們看過兩次，可是影片中眞切動人的表演把伊更着迷深了。我這位同事向我在暗下說起過幾次，「你的這位女同學，敢眞痴了，老是埋怨我是没中用的樊家樹，没有一個沈鳳喜和關秀姑，可不好笑。」有一次，這位同事，偶然因爲應酬，陪了人家喝了一次花酒，却被伊偵知了，夫婦倆噪閙一塲，我曉得這消息後，便走去勸伊，我打趣的說：「你不是願你的樊家樹有一個沈鳳喜嗎？」她忿忿地回答：「沈鳳喜和何麗娜不就是一個人嗎？」（影片中胡蝶一人飾沈鳳喜何麗娜兩角。）</p>
<h3 id="c117">人道之詩 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 陶在東</p>
<p>丨使人觸目驚心丨</p>
<p>人道一片，一面描寫都市繁華，促少年之墮落，一面攝取陜災實狀，表農業之艱難，中間挿寫詩句，更使人觸目驚心，於是其詩句一時便誦。門人有來問詩之出處者，予記憶其二，述之如下：</p>
<p>鋤禾日當午，汗滴禾中土，須知盤中飱，粒粒皆辛苦。此晚唐人聶夷中詩也。晚唐詩境不高，聶亦無詩名，因後唐明宗李嗣源，胡人稱帝，宰相馮道，因奏對稱引此詩，意在勸其戢武卹農，其後司馬通鑑，朱熹綱目，均採此段奏對，故其詩遂流傳人口。當時馮道稱引，尙有一詩，其詞曰：「二月賣新絲，五月糶新穀，醫得眼前瘡，割却心頭肉。」亦摹寫農家苦况也。</p>
<p>「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨。」此杜工部北征詩句也。此詩五言百韻，乃杜集中傑作，詩中叙述天寳兵亂，及個人旅行歸家狀况，以曁其感想抱負，即今文學所謂實寫派。此二句忿言貧富苦樂之不均，不啻爲今日上海寫照，讀之而不警動者，非人也。予按杜稱詩聖，無美不備，讀其詩可通於作文以及作小說撰劇本種種不必定作詩也。其詩集編年註解，以「杜詩鏡銓」爲佳。</p>
<p>予言此者，良以吾國歷史材料，正爲豐富，而文學確有價値。願我青年，於科學課餘之暇，不妨選購經史子集數種，披覽消遣，等於看小說，閱雜誌，涉獵旣多，必能引起興趣，有裨學識，幸勿預存成見，擯棄不觀，遇應用時，遠引歐詩美諺，西文固亦自佳，其如國人不感興味何也。</p>

<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>伊這們一個字一個字用低婉凄清有疾徐高低的道地蘇白唱出來，一個字一個字從冷靜的空氣裏傳到三嬸嬸的耳鼓上，打動伊的心弦，聽得伊低下了頭，默然無聲，好像在那裏垂淚，因爲淡淡的月光，映照在伊的淚珠上，閃爍地有光，給愛姑照見了，甚是驚異，便問：</p>
<p>『哭麽？爲什麽？我不唱了，省得害你傷心。』</p>
<p>『不！不！你唱，你唱，我偶然想起一件事來，掌不住有些悲楚，我不想了，你唱罷！三嬸嬸急急仰起了頭，　住了餘淚，偷偷地用衣袖拭了一拭，竭力的聲明。</p>
<p>『三嬸嬸，你想起一件什麽事？可肯講給我聽聽？』</p>
<p>『不瞞你說，你所唱的，句句是我所經過的，好像。你用一隻針，刺在我受創過的傷痕上，我怎麽不加倍的痛呢。愛姑，你記着，來世倘然不幸還是一個女人，寗可做大人家的一隻猫，切莫給種田人家做媳婦。』三嬸嬸的頭，又低下去了，月光又照見伊臉上的淚痕了。</p>
<p>『嗄！………呢！………』</p>
<p>愛姑到底是十五歳的姑娘，不知輕重，竟在這靜寂而容易給人聽見的空間，放聲而哭，不幸伊的翁姑，小丈夫，都來了，雖没有『尖嘴姑娘』。『矮　阿叔』，可是翁，姑的呵叱，已夠嚇破伊的小膽子。</p>
<p>『半夜三更，哭什麽鬼！倒了一世的楣！』</p>
<p>『小倡根！……你也像唱灘簧和唱哭七七？！』</p>
<p>兩種不同立塲的不同評論，在聲色俱厲之下，嚇得三嬸嬸也踧踏不安起來，又得從門檻上立起來，勉强裝着笑容，迎上去說：</p>
<p>『劉大叔！………大阿嫂！………散了麽？我聽得有些倦了，還來，走過這裏，見你家愛姑在門外，怕伊寂寞，和伊談天，可笑伊眞膽小，我講一個僵尸的故事，伊竟嚇得哭出來了。劉婆子很爽朗地說：『哼………三嬸嬸！不用替伊遮蓋了！我們在田岸上走來的時候，還聽見伊在唱山歌呢，不知道伊又在轉什麽念頭，哭起來了。三嬸嬸！時候不早了，明天我告訴你，有許多許多的話呢。』</p>
<p>三嬸嬸見闖下了禍了，就趁勢說一聲：『明天會！』脚裏明白，溜之大吉，似乎隱約還聽得背後有忽高忽低的許多不平凡的談話聲，也不願意去細辨是否駡駡了。</p>
<p>……………………………………………………………………</p>
<p>第二天，劉婆子大駕光臨三嬸嬸的家裏了。三嬸嬸起初一嚇，後來想，横竪是寡婦，不怕人來欺侮了，况且平時也有一些『難惹』的名聲，是以和劉婆子分庭抗禮了。便在送茶，抺桌子，拂竹樓的招待中，說過了幾句没要緊的閒話，接着就談到『何事要登三寳殿』的問題上去，劉婆子先嘆了一口氣，喝了一口茶說：</p>
<p>『昨夜你走了，那鬼丫頭兀自努起了嘴，過了一夜，到今天，還是掛得起醋罐頭呢』。</p>

<p>代表演說　翁氏致詞畢、隨由虞洽卿及林康侯兩氏、相繼演說、虞氏略謂、今日各界歡送翁將軍、對翁將軍之事蹟、想均深悉、無庸贅述、翁將軍在吳淞一役、提高中國之人格、蓋以前各國對我軍隊、向存鄙之心、而翁將軍在暴日軍艦飛機夾攻之下、能堅守三十餘日、各國人民、當可改變其態度、而不輕視我軍隊也、翁將軍除研究陸軍外、對航空亦有興趣、以前乘坐飛機、曾有三次失事墮地而未受傷、此乃天助我翁將軍也、翁將軍此次去官、出洋研究航空、並考察各國空軍、回國後、將創辦飛機廠、及組織民航歡送翁將軍　國大會（徐天章攝）</p>
<p>機、其歸國期、約在八月後、屆時我人當再開會歡迎　云、林康侯氏略謂、在淞滬抗日戰爭時、余即聞翁將軍之名、而私心欽慕之、日前在宴席上、得晤翁將軍、小談數語、即如故舊、蓋平日素所欽慕、不覺一見如故耳、翁將軍素主張國人合作互助、一致對於、而平日更操守廉潔、守法負責、我國軍人能人人如翁將軍、則鄰國之窺伺、當不足畏也云云、</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>梁作友捐金三千萬元。我已談過數次。現在再要談梁作友。未免討厭得很。但比較梁作友有地位的人。我不敢談。比較梁作友無價値的人。又不必談。只好再來談談梁作友。</p>
<p>梁作友捐金三千萬元一事。方傳播時我甚疑心。以爲莫須有的事。現在業已大白。果係哄騙性質。昨據京訊。詭稱捐資救國的梁作友。以所圖未成。致遭識破。無顔見人。已於前日偕其同來隨員。乘津浦車北返山東黃縣原籍。轟動全國。捐助鉅資的一齣把戲總算告一叚落。</p>
<p>但梁作友身帶隨員。赴京請願。毁家救國，捐助鉅金。其實原是一齣「空城計」若苟有常識的人。明知此種把戲。决不會售。而梁作友竟大言不慚。遍謁當道欺騙國人。欺騙政府觀其計劃。和行動即知其非有神經病者。决不敢如此胆大妄爲。語無倫次。似可置諸不論不議之列。</p>
<p>惟觀梁到京多時。態度從容。語言閃爍。决非似有精神病者。而其結果。完全係欺騙性質。分文不名。非但國人受其欺騙。即政府亦吃了一個「空心湯團」。如此刁猾之徒政府自應加以懲戒以儆刁頑。</p>

<p>— 盛展能</p>
<p>硇精在商業上，是一種極重要的化合物，如液化硇精用以作凍冷劑，多量的硇精用以製造炭酸鈉，在農業上，可用其化合物以作肥料，其他於醫藥上，工業上，都有相當的用途，</p>
<p>今就其製造，性質，用途，三者分論之，</p>
<p>（Ａ）製造　可分爲商業製法及實騐室製法二項，</p>
<p>商業上之製法：石炭之蒸溜，爲商業上硇精之一大來源，乃一種極有價値之副産物，故每於製造煤氣及大規模製造焦炭之工廠中，當蒸溜煤炭時，以水洗滌所發生之氣體，可得多量之阿摩尼亞液，然後將其溶液與焦油分離，次加石灰以與酸類化合，加熱，硇精即行驅出。（導之入硫酸或鹽酸即得硫酸錏或氯化錏）</p>
<p>實騐室之製法：</p>
<p>（一）用消石灰及錏鹽（所氯化錏，硫酸錏等）之混合物，和水，熱於有道管之蒸溜器中，即得，</p>
<p>Ca（ＬＨ）２＋２NH4　Ce丨ＣaCl２＋２NH4OH</p>
<p>NH4OH-NH3++H2O</p>
<p>（二）温熱阿摩尼亞液，亦生此氣，（此氣易溶於水，故須於水銀上聚之，或用向下移代空氣法於倒瓶中集之，）</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>於實騐室中所製得之硇精氣，須用生石灰行乾燥法乾燥之，</p>
<p>（Ｂ）性質丨</p>
<p>（一）物理性質：硇精爲一無色之氣體，具有一種特殊之刺激性臭，其氣體之密度，稍大於空氣，易溶於水，其三五％之溶液，即市售之「濃硇精」，液化之硇精，恒用以驚熱凍冷，因處於液態之硇精，於攝氏零下三三度蒸發時，每克能吸收三三○加路里之熱，故爲一極好之凍冷劑，</p>
<p>（二）化學性質：硇精之性質，頗不安定，於七百度時，幾完全分解，</p>
<p>硇精能燃於純粹之氧中，（不燃於空氣中，）生成水氣及游離氮，４ＮＨ３＋３０２－３Ｎ２＋６Ｈ２Ｏ</p>
<p>許多氧化物燃燒時，如以硇精導於其上，則能使之還原，３ＣＵＯ＋２ＮＨ３－３ＣＵ＋３Ｈ２Ｏ＋Ｎ２</p>
<p>氧及溴之蒸氣，能與硇精中之氫相化合而使氮質解離，２ＮＨ３＋３Ｃe2-N2＋６ＨＣe</p>
<p>以能與氮化合之金屬，（如鎂，）加熱於硇精之氣流中，則氫爲所化代，</p>
<p>3Mg－２ＮＨ３－Ｍg３Ｎ２＋３Ｈ２</p>
<p>硇精與鉀及鈉起作用，則生硇基質，（含ＮＨ２根之化合物，）如硇基鈉ＮaＮＨ２。</p>
<p>２ＮＨ３＋Ｎa－２ＮaＮＨ２＋Ｈ２</p>
<p>在零下七十九，三度以下之温度，硇精亦能與水化合，生白色固體之氫氧化錏，</p>
<p>ＮＨ３＋Ｈ２Ｏ－ＮＨ４ＯＨ</p>
<p>硇精最著之性質，爲與酸類化合而生錏鹽，</p>
<p>ＮＨ３（氣體）　ＨＣe（氣體）－ＮＨ４Ｃe（固體）</p>
<p>２ＮＨ３（氣體）＋Ｈ２ＳＯ４（液體）＋（ＮＨ４）２ＳＯ４（固體）</p>
<p>（Ｃ）用途丨硇精氣，其自身固可用作凍冷劑及製造炭酸鈉等，然其鹽類則更爲重要，</p>
<p>硫酸錏：爲農業上一種極重要的人造肥料，其所含氮份，恒於二四·二五至二五％之間，此物可用以製造多種錏鹽，如氯化錏，炭酸錏，水化錏等，商業上所售之硫酸錏，通常呈淡灰色，常含有少量之酸及水份，</p>
<p>氯化錏：俗名硇砂，用食鹽（即氯化鈉，）或氯化鉀分解硫酸錏而得，可用昇華法以提純之，常用於電池中，亦用於洋布印花術及銲術，可以製造染料，在醫藥上亦有相當用途，</p>
<p>溴化錏：用於攝影術及醫藥中，</p>
<p>氟化錏：用以蝕刻玻璃，</p>
<p>炭酸錏：可加熱硫酸錏，白堊及少量木炭之混合物質之，用以製造嗅鹽，烤粉，化裝品及錏困基染料，用於洗滌，亦用於醫藥，</p>
<p>此外，燐鹽之重要者有錏酸錏，用以製造人造肥料，硝酸錏，用以製造炸藥，釩酸錏，用以製造黑色墨水及用於布類之印花術及染色術中，等等，</p>

<p>— 謙受益</p>
<p>近來，本報附刊上有「改良社會討論會」一欄，凡是我們對於社會有所不滿意而視爲應加改良的種種問題，我們有機會提出討論，俾集大家的意見，决定應加改良或廢除，其用意不用說是很善的了。</p>
<p>這欄裏所提出的問題，有大有小；有一人之能力已足改良的，如「改良送禮」「革除烟酒恶習」「改良兒童睡眠」……等等；有的須藉大衆的力量才能改良的，如「星期六廢止休假」「學校納費問題」「改革歷書」……等等。然而不論它改良的方式怎様，其提出改良的那些問題，確有討論的價値，是無可疑議的。</p>
<p>不過僅僅平這様地提出討論，使大家知道怎様改良，好雖是好，若不去實行，也就等於紙上談兵。我國所以空喊了幾十年「改革」和「打倒」的口號，結果還等於零，就爲這個緣故。因爲鑒於此點，所以我對於本欄有更進一步的希望，現在願和提出問題諸君討論討論。</p>
<p>據我個人的意見，改良社會問題的討論，目的是在於眞實地踐行，所以最好不僅是紙上寫寫，或專論海闊天空的大題目，就算完了。我們一方面固然應當就一己所見到應加改革的問題，藉報紙的力量，普遍地發揚出去，一方面更應當以身作則就自己所能做到的丨如革除烟酒惡習，丨先去實行，然後再把體騐所得到的結果，和它的利益，報告大衆，這様，大家見有美滿的效果，自然會羣起相從了。至於一時不能根本解决的社會制度，亦可以藉變通辦法，徐圖改革，譬如星期六廢止休假，一時因爲泥於習慣，不易變更，然而我們可以利用這時間來做别的工作，祗要人人這様實行，不就等於不休假麽？久後，這習慣就可廢除了。像這様討論和實踐同時進行，才有意義，有價値，才不枉費諸君一番心思。</p>
<p>社會的改良，是大衆的幸福，這使命是每個人都負有的。因此我雖不文，也敢不揣翦陋地來貢獻一點意見，倘諸君以爲芻蕘尚足採取，希望共同起來實行。</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>丨街頭做事之一丨</p>
<p>銅匠老陳，手握着這個月薪工丨大洋十元，欣然的走出了公司會計處的門口，心想老婆曾說：拿到工錢，得爲兒子買一件衣服，但這一點錢，夠什麽用呢！六塊錢的房租，三塊錢米店裏的舊欠，還得還李麻子四毛錢，還得買柴鹽……啊，这一點錢夠什麽用呢！他想着，茫然地踏上柏油的馬路。</p>
<p>四角洋鈿換一塊……要贏銅鈿大家來……，一陣陣曳長的聲音，從馬路旁黑越越一大堆人羣中逸出。同時一塊去，二塊去，的一片銀洋角子聲。</p>
<p>又是什麽把戲，大意識促他去看個仔細。</p>
<p>這是一個賭攤。一隻木板撑檯上紅的點和綠的點，排綴成天，地，人，我，四張牌，檯上更貼着愛賭須心思，看牌分輸贏，兩條紅紙的標語，算是賭徒的口號吧！圍觀的人，有短衣，也有長衫；有男人也有女人，千百隻眼睛，都集中在檯上一小匣。匣中放着一張牌。這許多押錢人的命運，都取决於這方寸之竹上。在這一開一換中間，銅錢就不絶地在搬家。</p>
<p>銅匠老陳，呆呆地看着，旁邊穿短衣的瘦子，每押必中，四角錢的本，已贏進五塊多，對面那高個子也不差，贏了二三塊。心想，眞是幸運的事。這時，四角洋鈿換一塊的聲音與銀洋聲，不絕地交響着。多誘惑的聲音，打動了老陳的心，使他不自立的摸出袋裏賸下的二毛錢，跟那瘦子丨他很信用他的技術丨從天牌上一押。</p>
<p>四角起碼！攤上人說。二毛錢終於再還到自已的手裏，但這一下，恰又開着眼看那瘦子又贏進一塊錢。無窮的懊喪，鼓起他最大的决心，把血汗換來的銀元，押四角的鄭重的塞上檯去，這回破天荒的第一回，他居然博得一塊錢，這使他十分感謝那瘦子給他的暗示。袋中平添了一塊錢，超越於一天勞動的代價。該如何的喜悅啊！心想，小孩買衣服的錢是有了。但人心是無饜的，再着一下，不是連油醬等都有了叹？他想。但事實决不如理想的美麗，四毛錢，又滾還莊家那邊去了，還連得那瘦個子也懊喪，事情眞不是尋常。</p>
<p>一下又一下，袋底漸漸地輕鬆，煩惱也漸漸地加重。摸摸袋裏，僅賸二元了，要走不願，要不走又將如何？他迷惘了，一切失了信仰。</p>
<p>這一下要再不着，我不賭了！瘦個子的同志，把手中三塊錢盡押上，向他一看說。大有破釜沉舟之概。</p>
<p>對啊，拚他一下！興奮跳上他心頭，也照數一丢。但抱歉得很意志並没有戰勝事實，十塊錢盡記上了莊家今天收入的賬。他瘋瘋了，像大夢初覺一般，他記起了一切房租……米店欠欵……孩子的衣服……他想攫還他失去的金錢，然而，用什麽理由呢，直捕在房邊，將說他是犯法是盜刦犯。然而，他們又持什麽理由拿我的金錢去呢！他紊亂的思想終於迫他惘然地離開了賭攤。</p>
<p>四角洋鈿換一塊……曳長的聲音依舊不失其誘惑的力量。第二個賭徒正開始踏上老陳的覆轍。</p>

<p>— 刻波</p>
<p>一個早晨，在我們學校裏各處牆壁上，發現了許多没來歷的標語，那上面是畫着一個難看的洋山芋，和幾個歪斜的字，什靡書獃子畸人！……我看了，眞莫明其妙，一時更摸不着頭腦。</p>
<p>後來，我知道這就是對一個光着頭的同學影射的標語。</p>
<p>我終於不大了解，剃了一個和尙頭，也總算不得什麽？爲甚麽要這様大驚小怪，拿和尚頭去比洋山芋，侮辱麽？不，我覺得是一種無聊的勾當而已！那個和尚頭的同學，是一年級裏的學生，他是從來不講究修飾的，粗黑的臉上，從没有看他塗上什麽，一套破舊的學生裝，那　口簡直和他的足一様的大小，脚上一雙卓别林式的皮鞋，後跟幾乎没有了。這一切，這一切便是他永恒的標記。他這様的在時髦現代學生界裏求學，確是要使人們另眼看待。不過他在時髦的追逐趕不出人家，但是他在功課上已是先人萬步了。</p>
<p>早上，同學們個個都在着做甜蜜的好夢。天還只有一點不夠看書的光，他便披着一條氈子，拖着木履，跑到草地上在唸他的和尚經了。等到天大亮了，草地上的同學也漸漸地多起來，他却又獨自蹲在宿舍裏用功。</p>
<p>平時圖書館，草塲上，樹蔭下，任何人都可看見他獨自拿着一本書一支筆在那邊唸書。有時看見他仰着頭喃喃地不知讀的什麽，有時看見他都會對着一草一木看個出神，玩皮的人看見他，就會喊起他的别號，「洋山芋」……可是他好像没有聽見一般，不怒，也没有什麽表示。</p>
<p>星期日，假日，我好幾次碰到他在公園的深徑中看書。要是和他至誠的招呼，他至多是報你一個低頭微笑，人家從没有看見他的笑顔，在他的人生中似乎也好像缺少笑的成分。</p>
<p>他很勤苦。衣服都是自己洗濯，至於看影戲買閒食，我想他怕是没有，至多是半年也不過一二次。</p>
<p>像這様的，在現代時髦所謂前進的學生界，確弄得畸人。但是我總希望多産生幾個才好。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Question of Continuing to Borrow American Wheat  by Xiao Mei <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Last year, due to disaster relief efforts, a large quantity of wheat and wheat flour was borrowed from the United States, totaling 593,000 short tons (each short ton is 2,000 pounds, equivalent to 1,500 catties, or 15 dan). The value was over US$14,110,000. This American wheat was directly used to relieve refugees. While the effect was not very noticeable, it was indirectly used for building embankments and preventing disasters, which was quite effective. This year, encouraged by last year's success, there is a proposal to continue borrowing 450,000 tons of American wheat.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are rumors that the contract will be signed soon. Public opinion is noisy and clamorous. However, American sources have strongly denied this, attributing it to election propaganda in the United States and claiming it will not materialize. Therefore, the truth is still difficult to ascertain. However, as it concerns the people's food supply, it cannot be ignored. Therefore, based on statistical reports, I will briefly present the advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Last year, floods inundated the country, causing widespread suffering. This led to the proposal to borrow American wheat. In addition to borrowing American wheat, there was also a large import of grain. Rice imports reached over 10,740,000 dan, valued at over 64,370,000 Haikwan taels; wheat imports reached over 21,370,000 dan, valued at over 82,090,000 Haikwan taels; and flour imports reached over 4,080,000 dan, valued at over 24,900,000 Haikwan taels. In total, over 36,200,000 dan were imported, valued at over 171,000,000 Haikwan taels. The amount was unprecedented in our country. It is truly lamentable that a country traditionally based on agriculture would have such a massive grain trade deficit.</p>
<p>This year, the autumn harvest is abundant, and many provinces along the Yangtze River are suffering from a surplus of rice and grain. Rice prices have plummeted, and there is a trend of prices falling lower each day. Cheap grain hurts farmers, which is inevitable. The economic pressure faced by farmers is likely no less tragic than in a famine year. Under these severe circumstances, when we should be rejecting foreign grain imports, how can we borrow American wheat to exacerbate the crisis of grain surplus in our country and accelerate the collapse of the rural economy? The United States is already suffering from a surplus of grain. Even if they use it to feed livestock, or even burn it, or throw it into the ocean, they would not care. Now that they have found a major outlet, why wouldn't the United States be happy to do so? However, our own country's production is already suffering from oversupply. If we add the dumping of foreign wheat, the market situation will inevitably worsen, perhaps to the point where no one cares. If we say we are borrowing American wheat for famine relief, it is more appropriate to prepare rice rather than wheat, and it is more appropriate to use our own surplus rice rather than the American surplus wheat. Storing grain in good years is very convenient. Why seek external help? This is a very obvious point. Moreover, in terms of the price of American wheat, the American wheat borrowed last year cost approximately US$20 per short ton. Adding transportation and insurance costs, it cost a total of US$24 per ton. With US$1 equivalent to 5 yuan in domestic currency, that is 120 yuan, or about 8 yuan per dan. This is about 30% higher than the market price, and we still have to pay 4% interest. We do not know the details of the terms for the proposed borrowing of American wheat this time. If it is the same as last year, then these 450,000 tons of American wheat would be worth US$12,000,000, equivalent to 60,000,000 yuan in domestic currency, or about 9 yuan per dan. Compared to the market price, it would result in a loss of about 20,000,000 yuan in domestic currency.</p>
<p>This would directly inflict a huge wound on public finances and indirectly impose an unexpected burden on the people. What need is there for this? Taking a step back, famine relief is an urgent matter of national importance, and any loss should be disregarded. However, wheat cannot be stored for a long time and must be constantly circulated, replacing the old with the new. Otherwise, it will rot and become unusable. The American wheat borrowed last year already had the problem of being unsuitable for milling, forcing it to be sold at a reduced price. It is not even suitable for emergency relief, let alone famine preparation. Looking back at the past and thinking about the future, I firmly believe that the proposal to continue borrowing American wheat is unacceptable. I sincerely hope that the rumors are false.</p>

<h3 id="e14">A Certain Important Person Refutes the Japanese Opinion Paper <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter asked a certain important person visiting from Japan about their observations and opinions on the content of the Lytton Report. The following is their response. The Japanese government's so-called observations on the Lytton Report are said to be divided into five chapters. The first and second chapters concern the September 18th Incident and the "Manchukuo" issue. The investigation team's report has already made clear rulings on these two points. Regarding the September 18th Incident, the investigation team declared that "the military actions taken by the Japanese army on that night cannot be considered legitimate acts of self-defense." Regarding the establishment of "Manchukuo," it was recognized that it was due to "the presence of Japanese troops and the activities of Japanese civil and military officials" and "cannot be considered to have arisen from a genuine and free independence movement." However, Japan is still arguing and distorting the facts. In the end, they will not be able to deceive the eyes and ears of the world. Regarding the third chapter of the Japanese observations, which attacks China as an ununified and unorganized country, the important person declared that if China has not yet reached a state of complete unification, it is partly due to the phenomena occurring during China's evolutionary period and partly due to Japan's manipulation, interference, conspiracy, and sabotage. Let's take a few of the most obvious examples in recent years as proof. For example, in 1928, Japan sent troops to Shandong to obstruct the National Revolutionary Army's northward march to unify China, resulting in the Jinan Incident, which is known to the world. Also, in the same year, Japanese officials strongly prevented Zhang Zuoliang from changing the flag and prevented him from joining the Chinese camp, forming a unified China situation. This year, the instigation of "Manchukuo's" independence has reached the pinnacle of Japan's conspiracy to incite internal strife in China. Let's further quote the records in the investigation team's report to confirm this. The first chapter of the report states, "Just as the Nanjing government was gradually eliminating the important Red Army, it had to stop its offensive due to incidents elsewhere and withdraw most of its troops. At that time, Shi Yousan rebelled in the north, and at the same time, the September 18th Incident occurred in Shenyang. Encouraged by the above situation, the Red Army resumed its offensive. Before long, the results of previous victories disappeared." This section of the report can explain why China's efforts to quell rebellions and achieve unification have been repeatedly thwarted over the years. Regarding the Chinese people's anti-Japanese problem mentioned in the fourth chapter of the Japanese observations, Foreign Minister Luo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a declaration to China and the outside world on August 29th, stating four principles. One of them stated, "Under the current situation created by Japan's military aggression, it is absolutely impossible for the Chinese people to express the most cordial friendship towards the Japanese people. Improving and restoring the relationship between the Chinese and Japanese people is up to Japan. The one who tied the bell must untie it. It is hoped that the Japanese people will deeply reflect on themselves." The fifth chapter of the Japanese observations states that since Japan recognized Manchukuo, the report of the investigation team is no longer applicable. Regarding this point, Sir Lytton recently published an article in the American "Foreign Affairs" magazine, which provided an accurate answer. He said, "The fact that Japan alone recognizes 'Manchukuo' does not reduce the value of the report in any way; rather, it increases its strength." Therefore, representatives attending the future League of Nations conference do not need to reduce their belief in their mission because of this action. Japan often claims that the investigation team's report is biased towards theory and far from the facts. Lytton said, "The existence of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty are also facts that cannot be ignored." His words can be described as stern. In short, the facts speak for themselves. Japan relies on military force to invade China. Faced with the world's just criticism, it still does not know how to reflect. It only wants to rely on propaganda to slander China, hoping to deceive the world and conceal its crimes of aggression. This only shows that its efforts are increasingly futile.

<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Menglin expressed his opinion on the Chen Duxiu case to a reporter from a certain news agency, saying that Chen had made great efforts for the National Revolution in the past and was a pioneer in Chinese thought during the May Fourth Movement. In recent years, he was dissatisfied with the Chinese Communist Party's cadre faction's violent policies, which led to his being excluded by that faction. He then retreated to lead the anti-cadre faction and attacked vigorously, causing considerable blows to the cadre faction. Therefore, from the standpoint of anti-communism, if Chen has no evidence of harming the Republic of China, he should be pardoned. Currently, the leaders of the national academic community are trying to rescue him, and the Central Government also intends to be lenient, so there should be no danger to his life.

After the period is completed, they will be employed as officer candidates, thereby supplementing the commanders needed during wartime.</p>

<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 1st: The Japanese Autumn Grand Maneuvers are scheduled to begin on the 11th in the Osaka and Kobe areas. Due to widespread rumors, communists and fascists are seizing the opportunity to launch large-scale anti-imperialist and anti-war demonstrations and plot assassinations of government officials. The Japanese government recently arrested many unstable elements on a large scale. However, still feeling that it is not enough, it has decided that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department will select 997 armed police officers with strong martial arts skills and give them special training. They will depart from Tokyo by special train to the Osaka and Kobe areas at 8:00 PM on the 6th, specializing in protecting high officials and investigating various anti-government plots. It is heard that 127 political police officers are participating, which shows that the Japanese government is very nervous about the current domestic unrest.</p>

<p>Nichiren League, Tokyo, 1st: The League of Nations Council will meet on November 21 to review the Manchurian problem, focusing on the Lytton Report. There is an opinion in Geneva to limit the Council's session to three days, immediately followed by the General Assembly or the Committee of Nineteen. On this issue, the opinions of large and small countries seem to be quite different. The Japanese government has decided on a policy of advancing with a Council-centric approach from beginning to end, and reorganizing the composition of the delegation. On the first day of the Council's general debate, Ambassador Nagaoka will stand on the front line. After the debate by representatives of various countries on the Lytton Report reaches its climax, Representative Matsuoka will take the stage to refute the report's fallacies on the substance of the Manchurian problem, enlighten the ignorance of the nations, and clarify the Japanese government's attitude. At the same time, Ambassadors Matsudaira and Nagaoka will begin side negotiations with representatives of Britain and France, etc. Ambassador Sato, Deputy Secretary-General Ito Nobushi, and others who are well-versed in the League of Nations' internal affairs will negotiate with representatives of small countries. Ambassador Yoshida, in his capacity as the chief advisor to the delegation, will fully implement the Lytton investigation team's major mission.</p>

<p>As Propaganda Material Against the League of Nations</p>
<p>United Chinese Press, Tokyo, 1st - The Japanese representatives who will attend the League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva are currently busy preparing pretexts to slander China. The war between the two Lius in Sichuan and the dispute between Han and Liu in Shandong are both intended to be used as evidence of incessant internal strife in China. Later, upon hearing that Foreign Minister Luo had made considerable preparations for explanatory materials on this matter, and telegraphing this information to representatives Yan, Gu, and Guo, they felt that there would inevitably be a major verbal battle. Therefore, they dispatched several ruffians who are familiar with Chinese affairs to secretly investigate Sichuan and Shandong, etc., to provide materials for the League of Nations General Assembly as malicious propaganda.</p>

<p>Cold Reception by the Public as Herriot Arrives in Spain</p>
<p>University Students Strike and March</p>
<p>Opposing Any Warmongering Plans</p>
<p>Havas, Madrid, 31st - French Prime Minister Herriot today presented the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor to Spanish President Zamora, who also presented Herriot with a newly established Spanish Republic medal. Today, Herriot successively visited the Socialist leader of the Chamber of Deputies, Besteiro, and the Prime Minister of State, Azaña. Besteiro stated that his discussions with Herriot were limited to general political issues, and Herriot stated that his visit was merely a friendly one, and should not be considered to have secret purposes.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 31st - Herriot's entourage included more than forty people. The Spanish Prime Minister personally welcomed him at the station, and most of the Spanish cabinet members were also present. However, this was only on the official level, and the public seemed to pay no attention to it. Few were aware of it. The police took strict precautions, and it was reported that several members of the Communist Party and the Anarchist Party were arrested for attempting to hold an anti-Herriot demonstration while distributing leaflets. The leaflets prominently displayed the words "Down with Herriot," etc. As for the reason for the cold reception from the people of Madrid, it is widely rumored that a military agreement will be established between France and Spain. Although this statement has been denied by the government, the rumors are still rampant, and newspapers not affiliated with the government often discuss this topic, stating that the government wants to use this as the price to consolidate the republican regime.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Madrid, 1st - Students at the Central University of Madrid announced a three-day strike to express their opposition to any warmongering plans between France and Spain. Last night, students marched in groups through the streets, shouting "Down with Herriot," "Down with Imperialism," and "Abolish War." Security forces repeatedly used batons to disperse the demonstrators, and arrested several leaders. However, as one group was dispersed, another would gather elsewhere. According to the leaders of the demonstrators, they oppose the overly close relations between France and Spain, because France has always favored the Spanish monarchy, even after Spain declared a republic, France still expressed sympathy for the deposed king. The Spanish people are very willing to be friendly with the French people, but do not want the Spanish Republic to become a dependency of France, like the Little Entente nations towards the great powers.</p>

<p>Newly Promulgated Harsh Regulations, Thirty-Eight Articles</p>
<p>Guatemala, October 2nd Communication - There are over a thousand Chinese living in Guatemala in Central America, who have always been law-abiding merchants and rarely violate the laws of their country of residence. However, since there is no treaty for consular protection with our nationals, the local government has not only strictly prohibited Chinese from entering the country, but has also cracked down on the residence of Chinese nationals. The harsh laws regarding immigration are numerous. Overseas Chinese in Guatemala cannot withstand the oppression of the harsh regulations and have repeatedly appealed to our government. Last October, our government ordered Dr. Li Shizhong, the acting consul in Panama, to go to Guatemala to inspect overseas Chinese affairs and comfort the overseas Chinese. It is reported that Acting Consul Li also discussed improvements to the Guatemalan regulations that mistreat overseas Chinese with the Guatemalan government. However, the Guatemalan government insisted on signing a treaty of friendship and commerce before it would cancel the harsh regulations. At that time, Acting Consul Li was unable to initiate discussions because the draft treaty had not arrived, and he returned to Panama at the end of December to negotiate, so the matter of the harsh regulations was put on hold. On August 27th of this year, the Guatemalan government's official newspaper "Centro America" suddenly published 38 articles of harsh regulations promulgated by the Guatemalan president to crack down on people of the yellow or Mongolian race. Among them, the difficult procedures for re-registration in the third article, the requirement to pay a fine of US$500 for each re-registration in the sixth article, and the restriction on overseas Chinese from opening new stores and restricting trade in the thirty-second article are the most severe. Local overseas Chinese, because the Guatemalan government has been implementing the new regulations since September 1st, old customers feel threatened, and new customers are even more miserable. They held two overseas Chinese conferences to discuss how to respond, and telegraphed our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find a way to rescue them, and also telegraphed Dr. Li Shizhong, the acting consul in Panama, to hurry to Guatemala to negotiate a treaty to protect the overseas Chinese. Our ruling leaders speak daily about protecting overseas Chinese, and Dr. Li Shizhong, the acting consul in Panama, is praised at the time for his love of the country and overseas Chinese. He will certainly not sit idly by and watch the overseas Chinese in Guatemala groan under the harsh regulations. It is also reported that Dr. Li Shizhong has been appointed by our government as the representative for signing a treaty between China and Guatemala, and the full powers certificate and draft treaty were sent to the embassy in Panama by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs long ago. Acting Consul Li, who loves overseas Chinese like a newborn child, will certainly have a way to relieve the suffering of the overseas Chinese in Guatemala.</p>

<p>Poland Suddenly Refuses to Mediate</p>
<p>Romanian Political Circles Greatly Disturbed</p>
<p>Havas, Bucharest, 31st - Romania requested Poland to mediate in order to negotiate again with the Soviet Union and sign a non-aggression treaty. The Polish government declared to Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu that Poland should remain aloof from the Romanian-Russian negotiations. This refusal greatly disturbed Romanian political circles. We still remember that when Poland negotiated with the Soviet Union, Romania also conducted negotiations with the Soviet Union at the same time. Later, difficulties arose due to the Bessarabian territorial rights issue. Poland acted as a mediator. Since then, Poland and the Soviet Union were able to sign a treaty, but Romania and Russia did not. This time, Poland did not grant Romania's request. According to well-informed sources, it is expected that Romania's negotiations with Moscow will encounter major difficulties.</p>

The British government currently has no reason to doubt these statements. Charlton asked, "Can Sir Simon guarantee that there will be no restrictions in the future?" Simon replied, "We must proceed step by step. If there is no doubt that the Open Door policy is being maintained, then we can be satisfied." Regarding the claims from British merchants against the "Manchukuo" authorities for goods previously supplied, totaling £28,749, the matter is being reported by the British Commercial Counselor in Peiping. Regarding the recent wars in Shandong and Sichuan provinces within China, the lives and property of British nationals are still safe. The suppression of Communists in central and southern China is currently making good progress.</p>
<p>News Headlines</p>
<h3 id="e79">Japanese Public Opinion After the Report Was Published <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>After the League of Nations investigation report was published, the Japanese were outwardly furious and attacked the investigation team (and even the League of Nations) as much as possible. From attack to abuse, even stable and reasoned arguments must demand the withdrawal of Chapters 9 and 10 for a re-investigation. On the surface, Japan's national opinion is truly united and the country has a new-found spirit. But we have asked, examined closely, and investigated to find out that! There is still much doubt about the unanimity of public opinion. It turns out that before the League of Nations investigation report was published, Japan had a general understanding of its contents and had prepared early. The military stood at the front, calling for all subordinate organizations such as the "Reservist Association," the "Kokuhonsha," the "Black Dragon Society," the "Gyochi-sha" and other groups to prepare and mobilize together. When the report was published, the military sounded the alarm and instructed each division commander to mobilize the local reservists and the local newspapers to create a so-called unanimous public opinion. At the same time, it also brought up the "Manchukuo" puppet state it had built, using the name of "thirty million people" to launch a rebuttal to the report. What it calls public opinion is: (From the Asahi Shimbun to the Yorozu Chuoho and other magazines, they all adopted the same line.)</p>
<p>(1) They all expressed considerable goodwill towards the first chapter of the report, because it said that China was not yet a modern nation, and almost everyone quoted "It can be seen that China's internal division forces are still strong. The reason for this lack of unity is that most nationals only know family and township, but not the country, and only feel it slightly when the basic country is in a very tense diplomatic situation with other countries." The reason why they often quote this passage is to substantiate their claim that China has not formed a modern nation and can be arbitrarily invaded by militarism.</p>
<p>(2) They believe that from the League of Nations to the investigation team sent out by the League of Nations, they all lack practical knowledge of the past China and "Manchukuo," so the theories in the report are all empty talk on paper and have not actually touched the core of the problem. Therefore, they gave the report a verdict, calling it "insufficient understanding."</p>
<p>(3) Starting from this lack of understanding, the investigation team's judgment that the actions of the Japanese army, especially the military actions of September 18th, went beyond the scope of self-defense is unfair. As for believing that Japan harbors territorial ambitions and launches military aggression based on these territorial ambitions, it is even more of a misunderstanding among misunderstandings.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the outbreak of the incident, the investigation team believed that Japan went beyond self-defense measures, and that the emergence of "Manchukuo" was not spontaneous, but was the activity of the Japanese army and officials. They even thought that this was slander, but they clearly stated the particularity of Manchuria (that is, Japan's special political and economic interests). They still think it's good.</p>
<p>(5) They all believe that the conditions and suggestions for resolution in Chapters 9 and 10 are violations of what they call the facts. This fact is the so-called independence of the puppet state, which has been recognized by Japan, and (armed) envoys have been sent. Therefore, they said, "The report is an empty theory, a travelogue, violates the facts, etc." Therefore, the Japanese government (which can simply be said to be the Japanese military) made opinions to the League of Nations based on the public opinion it created and based on the (puppet) public opinion it launched. The policy held by the Japanese representatives is:</p>
<p>"1. (The Japanese) Imperial Government's formal recognition of 'Manchukuo' is the serious execution of its national policy. No matter what situation is encountered, it will never revoke its recognition or (change) the nature of its recognition. Therefore, the discussions of the League of Nations must be carried out under the fact of (Japan's) recognition, with the non-movement of 'Manchukuo' independence as a prerequisite.</p>
<p>1. Impulsive resistance is enough to cause the worst situation, so it should naturally be avoided, and we should strive to do our best to coordinate in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. However, if (Japan's) legitimate claims are opposed to the League of Nations' claims and there is no room for compromise, then we should state the Empire's position and immediately and resolutely withdraw from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>2. (The Japanese) Imperial Government's views on the Lytton Report have been clearly stated in the opinions, and must be explained earnestly. That is, at the time of the Manchurian Incident, no matter what country faced it, it could not take any actions other than the actions taken by Japan. The League of Nations should fully understand this attitude."</p>
<p>This outline is certainly not enough to express Japanese public opinion, but it can express "imperial-made" public opinion, because the current Japanese newspapers and other periodicals are all dominated by the military's aggressive fanaticism, and there is nothing that can be found to be public opinion. Therefore, even people with a little clearer mind, such as Sasaki Hiroo, feel that it is too fanatical. Even Wax Mountain Seido felt that denying China's lack of a national organization as much as possible would result in "Manchukuo" not being truly independent (that is, it is tantamount to admitting that Manchukuo was made by Japan...) Isokaze Ichiro believes that Japan's recent freedom of speech is extremely narrow, and there seems to be no room for speaking. There is no way to say much, but he also saw clearly that the investigation team's report was woven into the complex relationships of international imperialism. Hosoda Tamiki believed that "the Lytton Report implies placing China under international joint management, especially 'Manchuria' must be divided fairly. Although the Japanese warlords view (the Lytton Report) as nothing more than an Asian travelogue, after all, in reality, it is a 'China Division Compass,' and the beginning of the great powers' division of China." Indeed, this statement seems a bit over the top, but he has insight into the psychology of imperialism. As far as Japan is concerned, since Uchida Yasuya (Foreign Minister) has gambled that "I (Japan) will fight for the Northeast even if it turns into scorched earth...", then all public opinion and all diplomatic maneuvers are useless.

<h3 id="e80">Stalemate in the Sichuan War <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui Plans to Shorten Defense Lines and Take a Desperate Stand</p>
<p>Troops Hope Zhang Qun Will Enter Sichuan and Support Tian to Govern</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The Sichuan War has been raging for a full month today. Initially, it was confined to Wusheng and Suining, then extended to Tongnan and Yongchuan, and finally, Chengdu was stained with blood, with corpses filling the city. The chaos is truly lamentable. When both sides issued general offensive orders, Liu Xiang seized the opportunity to occupy Wusheng, Suining, Tongnan, Yongchuan, and Jiangjin one after another. However, he later suffered some setbacks. In recent days, there has been no clear victor, so the original frontlines remain. Liu Wenhui, facing excessively broad defense zones and needing to balance various fronts, has decided to shorten the battle lines. The left wing will retreat to Anyue, the central wing to Dazu, and the right wing to Luzhou. If necessary, even Hechuan can be abandoned, concentrating all strength in Zizhong for a desperate last stand. In Chengdu, conflicts between Liu and Tian's troops have occurred twice. Under the armed surveillance of Deng Xihou, both sides are withdrawing their troops, with each stationing three regiments within the city. Tian's forces are stationed at the east, west, and north gates, Liu's forces at the south gate, and Deng's forces station over a division. In Jianyang, Tian and Deng's troops are stationed, with roughly equal strength, both isolating the two Lius and sharing the spoils. Other figures like Yang Sen and Liu Cunhou are also sending troops to grab a piece of the action, further complicating the Sichuan situation and making it even harder to resolve. According to insiders, this war was triggered by Liu Xiang's repeated confiscation of Liu Wenhui's weaponry. However, Liu Xiang's confiscation was not limited to the 24th Army. The weapons transported by Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang were all confiscated when passing through Chongqing. The various armies have long resented Liu Xiang and wanted to deal with him, but they were unable to do so due to insufficient strength, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. The generals advocate breaking up the defense zones, mainly because Liu Wenhui occupies the most territory, and everyone wants a share. They especially resent Liu Xiang's control of Chongqing. If Liu Wenhui had generously agreed to cede a dozen or twenty counties to Deng, Tian, and others to take over defense, then Deng and Tian would have certainly joined forces to attack Liu Xiang. Li, Luo, Liu, and Yang would also have risen up to support them. At the very least, they would have forced Chongqing to follow Chengdu's example, allowing various armies to station there. If that had happened, Liu Wenhui's losses would have been small, while Liu Xiang's losses would have been great. When Liu Wenhui opposed the Suining Conference, Liu Xiang instead expressed support, leading to dissatisfaction among the various armies towards Liu Wenhui, and they formed an alliance with Liu Xiang. However, although the generals are nominally allied with Liu Xiang, in reality, they are only outwardly compliant. Those directly fighting Liu Wenhui, apart from Li Jiayu and Luo Zezhou, are all directly subordinate to Liu Xiang. Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang are not involved. Furthermore, Yang's deployment of troops was instigated by Liu Wenhui with 300,000 yuan. Deng's mediation is also aimed at withdrawing Chen Hongwen's division, creating a complex and unpredictable situation. Each is seeking a way out for themselves, and it is impossible for them to genuinely provide troops or support to any side. Currently, the two Lius are still fighting, and the final outcome depends on the actions of Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang, with Deng and Tian having a particularly significant influence. It is said that there is a growing movement in Sichuan to force Liu Wenhui to hand over political power and support Tian Songyao as the chairman of the province. If this can be achieved, it may alleviate the situation and lead to a peaceful resolution. The generals are eagerly anticipating Zhang Qun's return to Sichuan. Liu Wenhui also does not oppose this, as Zhang is a Sichuan native, familiar with Sichuan affairs, has a position in the central government, and has connections with various parties. If he can offer suggestions, it will be easier to negotiate. Although Zhang has indicated that he will not go, he is studying ways to resolve the Sichuan situation and is rumored to be coming to Hankou soon to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to discuss everything. Perhaps after finding a solution, he will resolutely make the trip. (October 30)</p>
<p>Chongqing Air Dispatch: Since the Sichuan War began in Wusheng, Yu Liu (Xiang) and Rong Liu (Wenhui) only made formal contact in recent days. Fierce attacks and defenses have been taking place at Jiang (along the Yangtze River) and Yongchuan (on the Chengdu-Chongqing road). The Yu army (i.e., the 21st Army), led by Pan Wenhua and Mu Yingzhou, attacked Jiangjin, entering and exiting the city twice. Ultimately, with the assistance of the Yu side's air force and warships, a combined air, land, and sea attack forced the 24th Army's Xu Tingxiu brigade, which was defending the city, to withdraw completely from Jiangjin on the 27th. Both sides suffered significant losses in this battle, and nearly a hundred civilians in Jiangjin were killed by bombs dropped by Yu army planes.</p>
<p>On the land route to Yongchuan, the provincial army originally built five lines of strong defenses. After days of intense attacks by the Yu army and bombing by planes, the main defense lines were destroyed, and they retreated in disarray. The Yu army occupied Yongchuan City at 6:00 PM on the 27th.</p>
<p>After the formal contact between the 21st and 24th Armies, the fighting has become increasingly fierce, especially on the central Yongchuan front. The 21st Army is known for its firepower, while the 24th Army is known for its manpower. Each shows its special skills and pummels the other. After several days and nights of bloody fighting, the 21st Army finally prevailed after advancing and retreating three times. The situation on that front remains extremely tense. Liu Xiang personally led the police force to the front lines today to supervise the battle. At the same time, Chongqing has formally declared martial law due to the intense fighting on the front lines. (October 30)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Chairman Chiang's Tour of Hunan <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Wanders Around Dongting Lake and Junshan Island While Passing Yuezhou</p>
<p>Visits Yue Lu Mountain to Pay Respects to the Four Martyrs After Arriving in the Province</p>
<p>Orders Commanders of Various Divisions Under He to Come to the Province for Instructions</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: When Chairman Chiang arrived in Hankou to direct the suppression of bandits, He Jian had repeatedly telegraphed, welcoming him to Hunan to give guidance. Due to busy military affairs, he had been unable to visit for a long time. On the afternoon of October 26th, Hu Xiehui, director of the 4th Route Army Office stationed in Hankou, telegraphed that the Commander-in-Chief was scheduled to come to Hunan on the afternoon of the 27th at 2 o'clock, accompanied by Madam Song and fourteen staff members, and a platoon of guards, aboard the Chu You and Wei Sheng warships, and would arrive in Changsha around noon on the 28th. Upon receiving the telegram, He Jian immediately sent section chiefs Su Yongqing and Luo Zhen, and liaison officer Peng Shufeng, to prepare for the welcome, and designated the Guan Yue Temple as the welcome preparation office. The entire Jin Lida Academy within the temple was used as Chiang's headquarters. The more than 300 students of the National Arts Training Institute, originally stationed in the academy, were moved to the provincial warehouse overnight. The Western-style building on the left front of the academy was used as Chiang's office, the rear room as the bedroom, the rooms on the right side as the male and female staff quarters, the room directly behind as the bathroom, the front room on the left downstairs as the staff room, the rear room as the chief of staff's office, the front room on the right as the code room, the rear room as the secretary-general's office, the room directly behind as the attendant's room, and the large flower hall upstairs in the Guan Yue Temple as the reception hall. All the rooms upstairs and downstairs in the headquarters were furnished with new Western-style furniture, brass beds, satin quilts, and carpeted floors, making them extremely clean and elegant. A notice was sent to all civil officials above section chief level and military officers above the rank of major, asking them to gather at the main wharf outside Xiaoximen at 10:00 AM on the 28th to welcome him. The entire Changjiang Hotel was temporarily rented as a rest stop for the welcoming party, and three small steamboats, Xinhongyun, Xinhongtai, and Xinchangjiang, were rented to go out to meet the warships when they arrived. He Jian also sent Huang Fei, director of the Aviation Bureau, to fly downstream to meet him. By noon, several hundred party, government, and military officials, led by He Jian, had gathered at the Changjiang Hotel to wait. At 12:30 PM, Huang Fei returned to the province by plane and reported that the Chu You and Wei Sheng warships were still anchored in Yuezhou and that no warships had sailed upstream from Yueyin, indicating that Commander-in-Chief Chiang was still staying in Yuezhou. At the same time, Duan Heng, commander of the garrison brigade in Yuezhou, also telegraphed that Chairman Chiang had arrived in Yuezhou at 12:00 PM and was touring Dongting Lake and Junshan Island with Madam Song, and that he would set sail for Changsha from Yuezhou at around 3:00 PM. Chiang also telegraphed He Jian from Yuezhou at that time, saying that he was scheduled to leave Yuezhou for the province at 4:00 PM and would arrive around 10:00 PM, asking him to inform all parties not to welcome him and that he would not attend a banquet. So the welcoming party temporarily dispersed and decided to gather again at 10:00 PM that evening to welcome him. When the time came, several hundred people gathered on the riverbank for the second welcome. They waited until 11:00 PM without seeing him. Just as everyone was anticipating his arrival, they received another telegram from Duan Heng in Yuezhou, saying that the Commander-in-Chief had finished visiting Junshan Island at 3:00 PM and had transferred to the Jiangkun warship to sail to the province, but due to the shallow water, he had to stop sailing at night and would arrive in the province around 2:00 PM on the 29th. So the second welcoming party dispersed again. By about 1:00 PM on the 29th, party, government, and military leaders, as well as the public, gathered again at the main wharf outside Xiaoximen to welcome him. At 1:50 PM, the Jiangkun warship arrived at the port, military music played in unison, and He Jian and others boarded a small boat to welcome Chairman Chiang and his wife ashore, and they rode in cars directly to the Guan Yue Temple for a welcoming banquet. During the banquet, Chiang declared that this trip was purely for touring purposes and had no other tasks. He also said that since the 31st was the anniversary of the death of the Hunan martyrs Huang (Xing), Cai (E), Jiao (Dafeng), and Chen (Zuo Xin), he had decided to go to Yue Lu Mountain on that day to pay respects to the martyrs and to admire those who had gone before. If time permitted, he would also visit Heng Mountain in Nanyue. He Jian and Liu Jianxu then asked him if they could telegraph the commanders of the various divisions of the Fourth Route Army to come to the province to listen to his instructions. Chiang asked how many days it would take to gather everyone, and He said about four or five days. Chiang then agreed. He Jian immediately telegraphed five division commanders, Wang Dongyuan, Peng Weiren, Li Jue, Tao Guang, and Chen Guangzhong, ordering them to set off immediately for the province to hear instructions. This indicated that Chiang would stay in Hunan for four or five days. Chiang and his staff members decided to stay at the Guan Yue Temple headquarters, but Madam Chiang, finding the headquarters inconvenient, moved to He Jian's residence on Zhongshan Road.

<h3 id="e82">Situation of the Zhengtai Railway Takeover <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Shijiazhuang Dispatch: The Zhengtai Railway takeover issue, which has been rumored for over a year, has recently become a reality. Here is a record of the entire process:</p>
<p>The Zhengtai Railway was built with a loan in the 28th year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, and thirty years have passed since then. The principal and interest on the loan have been repaid, and the operating contract expired on October 15th. In addition to the chairman of the takeover committee, Wang Maogong, and the takeover members Zhu Hua, Luo Yingjun, Wang Tairui, and Wu Renfu, who arrived at the railway bureau earlier to prepare for the takeover in accordance with the Ministry of Railways' order, the Ministry of Railways recently sent counselor Ling Ji and specialists Yang Nian and Li Dan to supervise and assist in handling all takeover matters. After consultation between Chairman Wang and the French deputy chief engineer, it was decided to hold a takeover ceremony on October 25th, followed by a separate inventory. Once the entire inventory is completed, both parties will sign, and the takeover procedures will be completed. The takeover ceremony was held in the railway staff association hall. More than thirty representatives from all parties and guests attended, as well as more than two hundred people, including middle-level staff of the railway, union representatives, and French staff. The meeting opened at 9:00 AM on the 25th. First, Wang Maogong, director of the railway bureau and chairman of the takeover committee, presided over the meeting and performed the necessary formalities.

<h3 id="e83">Resolution of the Anhui Salt Affairs Revision Dispute <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The Anhui Salt Affairs Inspection Office changed its regulations, ordering all shops engaged in the sale of edible salt to provide guarantees to obtain licenses and to submit a four-column list of daily salt sales for inspection. All salt shops in the province objected, arguing that providing guarantees was unprecedented and that daily reporting was cumbersome and practically impossible. Moreover, before these regulations were implemented, salt shipments from various places were already being detained and fined by tax police for slight delays. As a result, letters and telegrams were exchanged, and opposition was widespread. The Anhui Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, at the request of local chambers of commerce, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance's Salt Affairs Administration, requesting that the Anhui Salt Affairs Inspection Office be ordered to continue operating under the old regulations to avoid disturbances. It is now reported that Wuhu's chief magistrate, Gao Shouheng, mediated the matter for several days, and the Inspection Office has accommodated the salt shops' requests and made changes. A dispute has been resolved. The Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a notice from Magistrate Gao yesterday and has notified the local chambers of commerce. The points of resolution are recorded below: (1) Regarding the issue of providing guarantees to obtain licenses, the merchants proposed that licensed merchants would definitely comply with the regulations, but guarantees were unprecedented and reputable merchants would not want to bear this heavy responsibility for others. The resulting solution was that a shop with two businesses could guarantee itself, without being overly demanding. (2) Regarding the issue of submitting daily reports, the merchants proposed that the procedures were too cumbersome, and any discrepancies would be rejected. Moreover, most shops also sold general merchandise and could not afford to hire additional staff to handle salt affairs specifically. The resulting solution was that a notice has been issued to change the reporting frequency to once a month. (3) Regarding the issue of fines for late salt shipments, the merchants proposed that salt shipments to various ports were transported by sailboats, and if they encountered wind, rain, or unexpected events en route, they would be punished regardless of the circumstances, only considering whether the deadline was exceeded, causing unbearable hardship. The resulting solution was that there was a notice in place stating that the deadlines would be enforced realistically and that circumstances would be taken into account. (4) Regarding the issue of harassment by tax police, the merchants proposed that tax police in various ports were taking advantage of the situation to harass merchants and arbitrarily cause trouble. They requested that this be prohibited to stabilize business. The resulting solution was that harassment by tax police would be strictly prohibited, and any complaints would be investigated and dealt with according to the evidence. (30th)</p>

<p>▲Songjiang, Fengxian, and Shanghai-South Boundary Delimitation Conference The various townships and towns east of Yexie Pond along the Punan border of this county, such as Zhaolin, Chongque, Hujiaqiao, and the 14th district area, Fengxian proposed that they should be placed under Fengxian's jurisdiction, while the various townships in Fengxian bordering Nanhui should be transferred to Nanhui. The case was submitted to the Ministry of Civil Affairs for approval. After being instructed to inform this county to reply, various local sectors, upon hearing of the matter, sent numerous letters and telegrams, advocating opposition. The case was suspended due to the sudden outbreak of the Shanghai War. The delimitation of the Shanghai-South border was also not implemented. It has recently been reported that the various counties have re-submitted the old case. After negotiation and decision, a joint conference of county government and commercial representatives will be held on the 11th of this month at the 8th floor of the Huaan Life Insurance Company on Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai. At that time, the relevant county magistrates will participate in the meeting with local impartial gentry and merchants. Shen Yong, the county magistrate of this county, believes that this case involves boundary issues and is very important. He is currently carefully selecting impartial gentry in order to represent and participate in the meeting. Fengxian County was originally carved out of the former Huating County. How can the people of Songjiang be willing to hear Fengxian's desire to carve out Songjiang? It is expected that there will be a dispute at the Shanghai conference.</p>

<p>▲Four-County Joint Defense Zone Conducts Joint Patrols The Four-County Joint Defense Zone of Wuxi, Wujin, Chengjiang, and Yushan held its 11th joint defense conference at the county government of this county the day before yesterday. The chairman was Chen Chuande, the magistrate of Wuxi County. The items discussed were: (1) Most of the counties in this joint defense zone are bordered by rivers and lakes, with numerous branching waterways. Sampans and fishing boats are constantly traveling back and forth, and it is difficult to ensure that there are no bandits hiding. It is proposed to order the various district offices along the rivers and lakes to drive wooden stakes into the less important small ports to prohibit passage. The major ports will be ordered to be carefully searched by the police at any time. It was decided that the various joint defense zones should deliberate and implement the measure. (2) As the winter defense season is approaching, it is imperative to supervise the implementation of joint patrols. The six measures decided upon are as follows: A. During the winter defense period, joint patrols will be conducted twice a month. The dates and locations will be determined separately. B. Irregular joint patrols may be conducted at any time by either side based on the border situation. C. When police and security agencies in the joint defense counties are ordered to conduct joint patrols, the respective commanders should jointly implement them. D. The joint patrol certificates should be exchanged during the joint patrol, and the joint patrol situation should be attached to the certificates and forwarded to the respective county governments for verification. E. The joint patrol certificates will be issued by the four-county joint defense office. F. Those who fail to attend scheduled joint patrols without good reason will be punished by their respective agencies. (3) The duration of each defense period was decided to be from November 1st to March of next year. (4) The wandering soldiers and scattered troops staying in the townships and towns will be expelled. (5) Tea houses and hotels in the townships will be investigated for harboring travelers. (6) The date of the next meeting was set for 2:00 PM on November 26th and will still be held at the Wuxi County Government. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>
<p>▲Party Headquarters Investigates Opium Public Sale The rumor of the public sale of opium in Jiangsu Province is rampant, with everyone talking about it, but the authorities are still vehemently denying it. Recently, the rumor of public sale in this county has become more prevalent, and there is even talk of Xuan Junhou contracting the two counties of Wuxi and Yixing. The various members of the 1st District Party Headquarters believed that this matter had been repeatedly denied by the provincial government, but it has been mentioned so frequently and with such certainty in newspapers and society that there must be some basis for it. Therefore, at the 18th committee meeting held yesterday, a proposal was put forward, based on the Premier's admonition against drugs, to request the superior party headquarters to conduct a strict investigation. At the same time, in view of the urgent need for anti-Japanese forces in the Northeast, and the lack of fighter planes, it was decided to request the county assembly to organize a national salvation movement to raise funds for national defense aircraft, and to conduct fund-raising activities in various ways.</p>

<p>▲ Basic Squad Captures Four Bandits: After the bandits in the eastern countryside were dispersed by the army, the remnants, led by Cai Xian, Shen Jin, and Shen, resurfaced recently. They kidnapped the grandmother of Yao Zhiming in Xinmiao Town, demanding a ransom of 200,000 yuan. After the victim asked people to negotiate several times, they recently agreed on 24,000 yuan and were about to redeem her. However, Shen Jin, the bandit leader, had the intention of washing his hands and surrendering last month. He sent a letter to Gan Kaijun, the captain of the basic squad, offering to reform himself and release the Yao hostage to atone for his past sins. On the 27th, he ordered his concubine, Wang Yahua, and fellow villager, Huang Kechang, to come to Pinghu from Shanghai and agree on the date of the ransom with Captain Gan. After replying to Shen Jin, he again ordered his concubine, Wang Yahua, and a small bandit, Shen Baolin, to go to Jiangzhuang in Songjiang County to inquire about the hostage from Cai Shenglai, the bandit in charge. While they were talking, the basic squad suddenly arrived. Shen Baolin, feeling guilty, quickly escaped. Wang Yahua and Cai Sheng were arrested and taken to Xincang for interrogation. Wang confessed that her husband, Shen Jin, instructed her to contact Cai Laoban and release the hostage, then go to the Datong Inn in Pinghu to meet him for surrender. After interrogating Cai, he refused to confess anything. Captain Gan Kaijun ordered Secretary Hu Zhengyue to lead a part of the militia to go to Pinghu to wait. Shen arrived as expected, using the alias "Lu" and staying at the Datong Inn. Hu immediately ordered the militia to surround the area and capture Shen. On the night of the 30th, the four bandits were escorted to the basic squad headquarters of the county security regiment, detained overnight, and escorted to the county government yesterday for review. Efforts are currently being made to rescue the Yao hostage.</p>

<h3 id="e97">A Relatively Scientific Teaching Guidance Plan (1) Du Gang <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The meaning of teaching guidance is very complex. Analyzed, it can be divided into the following three aspects: (1) Generally, teaching guidance is nothing more than the inspection of the teaching situation in schools, such as teaching equipment, teaching methods, teachers' and students' activities, and other conditions that can improve teaching efficiency. This is the most basic meaning of teaching guidance. However, in China, it seems already commendable if teaching guidance can be done thoroughly. (2) Teaching guidance is considered to be the training of teachers in service, so that teachers can expand their educational knowledge, improve their educational skills, and encourage their spirit of service. This meaning is undoubtedly more advanced, because according to this meaning, the instructor is not only an inspector but also needs to gain the trust and cooperation of teachers and assist teachers in improving their teaching. Therefore, the scope of teaching guidance is also more extensive. (3) The purpose of teaching guidance is to improve all aspects of teaching, such as defining mathematical goals, selecting and organizing teaching materials, arousing motivation, adapting to individuality, guiding learning, and other teaching methods, as well as physical conditions such as indoor temperature, light, ventilation, and seating. Here, the meaning of teaching guidance is more advanced and more extensive. The instructor is not only a teaching inspector or a teacher trainer but also an educational research expert responsible for improving all aspects of teaching. The above three aspects of the meaning of teaching guidance can also be said to be the three stages of the expansion of the meaning of teaching guidance. In the United States, the practice of teaching guidance has almost progressed to the third stage, while in China, it still remains in the first stage. Therefore, how to increase the efficiency of teaching guidance and how to change the aspects of teaching guidance is indeed a current question for China's educational administration. Based on the author's usual observations, teaching guidance in the future should strive from the following aspects:</p>

<h3 id="e98">Ministry of Education Sends Personnel to Shanxi for Inspection <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲ Observations on Education in Shanxi by Yu Tan</p>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: In order to inspect education in various provinces in North China, the Ministry of Education specially dispatched supervisors Yu Senwen and Dai Xia, who came to Shanxi together on the 22nd for on-site inspection. The Education Department sent personnel to receive them, and they stayed at the Jingu Xiang Hotel. The next day, they inspected Shanxi University and various colleges and universities in Bingyuan. They are expected to inspect for six days in Bingyuan, and then Dai will go to various counties in northern Shanxi, while Yu will go to southern Shanxi and then to Shaanxi for inspection. Mr. Yu talked to reporters about the schedule of inspecting education in various places, the future educational policies set by the Ministry, and his observations on education in Shanxi. The details of his talk are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>According to the talk, the school scale in Shanxi is grand and the buildings are complete. The biggest regret is the lack of books in the Faculty of Arts and Law and the lack of complete practice factories in the Faculty of Engineering. This is due to the lack of economy. The simple habits of poor students are rare in national universities. The spirit of the students is especially commendable. However, when we (Yu and Dai) asked the students to find the latest published books, the school had the least. The students' thinking can be known roughly from this. This is also caused by the environment in which they are located. Next, he said that the purpose of this inspection is to have a whole clear understanding of the situation of middle schools, universities, and primary schools in China, and to make a real survey and plan. Therefore, when leaving, seven outlines were prepared in advance: (1) Publicize the central education policy; (2) Supervise the implementation of the Ministry's programs; (3) Investigate the efficiency of local education administration; (4) Review the allocation and use of education funds; (5) Investigate and guide the facilities of education at all levels and social education; (6) Investigate the academic style and moral education situation; (7) Assess the performance of school personnel. He also talked about Shanxi University, which was jointly investigated by us (Yu) and Supervisor Dai. It was originally planned to be completed on the morning of the 22nd. Later, because the high school department of the school was combined with various colleges, it was completed together. On the 22nd, they saw the experimental primary school. In the afternoon, they went to the Education Department for inquiries. The 23rd was Sunday, and they took the opportunity of the school's holiday to visit Jinci Temple and returned to Bingyuan in the evening. The principals of various schools are invited to take the opportunity to talk about the precautions that schools should pay attention to in school. On the 24th, they went to Fenyang together to inspect middle and primary schools. On the 25th, Supervisor Dai went to the northern Shanxi area to inspect the middle and primary schools along the motor road, planning to stay in Zhe County for one day, in Jingle County for two days, in Dai County for two days, in Dingxiang for one day, in Datong for four days, in Lingqiu for one day, in Pingding for two days, and in Taiyuan City for five days. We (Yu) and Supervisor Dai divided the inspection. We (Yu) inspected the Faculty of Law, the School of Agriculture, the Business School, the Provincial No. 1 Women's Normal School, and the Provincial No. 1 Middle School, as well as Chengcheng Middle School. Dai inspected the College of Education, the Engineering School, the Bingzhou University, the No. 1 Normal School, the National Normal School, the Private Guanghua Women's Middle School, and three primary schools, as well as Bingzhou Middle School and Xinmin Middle School. Dai went to the north, and we (Yu) began to inspect the schools to be inspected. After we finished the inspection in Taiyuan, we went to the south to inspect the primary schools along the motor road, planning to stay in Qixian for one day, in Pingyao for one day, in Linfen for three days, in Zhaocheng for two days, in Xinjiang for one day, in Wenxi for one day, and in Yuncheng for three days. After the completion, he went to Shaanxi on the Longhai Line. On the one hand, he inspected various schools in Chang'an, and on the other hand, he was ordered to give special guidance to education in Shaanxi. Supervisor Dai returned to Bingyuan from the north, and then inspected the schools assigned to him. After the Taiyuan affairs were completed, Dai took the inspection results of various schools and took the Zhengtai car to Pinghan and returned to Beijing to report.</p>

<p>▲ Teachers, Students, and Alumni Sacrifice and Cooperate to Revive</p>
<p>After the accidental fire in the building in the second district of the Junior High School Department of Jiangsu Provincial Yangzhou Middle School, classes at all levels continued as usual, and students' studies were not affected. The Education Department sent a section chief to Yangzhou yesterday to investigate in detail and learned that all the reports of the school were true. The loss this time amounted to 20,000 yuan for both public and private parties. The fire was caused by street light electricity, which was not preventable by human power. The school can follow the example of other schools and apply to the Education Department for funds for repair. Moreover, the Education Department also expressed sympathy. However, all the faculty and staff of the school specially held a meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of revival. In order to show the spirit of Zhu's consistent responsibility and sacrifice and cooperation, it was decided to unanimously donate their salaries. In addition, the students and alumni of the school also launched fundraising activities to donate money, hoping to rebuild a taller and more refined building on the original site within two months for classes and self-study. At present, all the faculty, students, and alumni of the school have jointly formed a revival committee to actively carry out drawing, recruiting workers, and construction. It is heard that they will not ask the Education Department for subsidies unless it is absolutely necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Zheng Xigu's Talk on the Dispute at Huangdu Rural Normal School <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter went to visit Mr. Zheng Xigu, the former principal of the school, about the dispute between the Huangdu Local Security Regiment and the Provincial Rural School. Mr. Zheng gave a detailed explanation. His talk is recorded above: "Huangdu Rural Normal School was changed to the Rural Normal Department of Shanghai Middle School in the summer of the 16th year of the Republic of China. In the autumn of this year, the Education Department stipulated that rural normal schools in the province should be independent. The Huangdu Rural Normal School was succeeded by the original director, Mr. Teng Songshi, as the principal. Mr. Teng is full of educational knowledge and experience, sincere and responsible, and highly trusted by all the faculty and staff and students of the school. After the trial implementation of work-study experimental education last autumn, all the teachers and students of the school were able to work together with one heart and one mind to strive for the experiment of new education. And the people of Huangdu have always cooperated with the school, and they have given a lot of support to the work-study primary school. Unexpectedly, the security regiment and the school recently had a dispute. This is a very unfortunate event. However, the process of this matter has been stated by all the students of the rural normal school in the newspaper. The students' statement is indeed true. On the 25th of last month, I accompanied the Section Chief of the Education Department to the Rural Normal School for inspection. There was no opposition in the school, and they were very trusted. At that time, all the students were very angry with the behavior of the security regiment. Later, the deputy regiment leader of the regiment, Mr. Zhang, came to the school to apologize and promised to be responsible for the security of the school in the future. This dispute was resolved immediately. In the past five years, the rural normal school has gained the support and encouragement of the local people. In the future, it is hoped that they will continue to support the school with the original intention of protecting the rural normal school. Not only will the new education experiment of the rural normal school be realized, but also the local cause can receive indirect promotion and effect."</p>

<p>▲ Meeting at Huadong Middle School on November 5th</p>
<p>Private schools in the French Concession of this city, in order to discuss the request for subsidies from the French Municipal Council, were notified yesterday by Ma Jiazhen of Huadong Middle School to meet at the school on the 5th of this month to discuss the measures. Private schools in the French Concession that have not received the notice can also participate freely on that day. The notification is recorded as follows: Sincerely, the French Concession of this city has a large area and a large population. The development of education cannot be delayed. Although there are dozens of schools in the Concession, most of them are private. They often cannot expand due to lack of funds. I believe that the French Concession authorities collect a huge amount of taxes from our Chinese people every year, but they have never borne any burden on the education of our Chinese people. Our colleagues in the education field should immediately rise up and strive for the French Municipal Council to subsidize private schools in the Concession according to the method of the Public Concession, and to establish Chinese schools in order to develop education. It is scheduled to meet at our school at 1:00 PM on November 5th (Saturday) to discuss the measures. At that time, please send representatives from your school to attend and discuss the progress together, and please reply in advance.</p>

<p>Ms. Zhu Xuejing (courtesy name Danru), the wife of Mr. Zhang Zhongbin, was one of the few female educators in the country. Unfortunately, she passed away this summer, which is deeply regrettable. Colleagues in the education field held a memorial meeting at the auditorium of Shanghai Provincial Middle School at 2:00 PM on the 30th of last month. For a time, teachers, friends, and students came in plain cars and white horses, and there were as many as seven or eight hundred wreaths and elegies. At 2:00 PM, the meeting was opened with mournful music and salutes. After a moment of silence to pay tribute, Chairman Zheng Xigu gave a speech, followed by female students from Shanghai Middle School offering wreaths. Mr. Zhang Lunqing represented the attendees and read the eulogy. Mr. Cai Yishun represented Principal Zheng of the Women's Sericulture School and all the teachers and students to read the eulogy. Guests He Bingsong, Ren Mengxian, Zhang Xian, Zhu Jing'an, Tian Ding'an, Gu Defang, and Zhu Fanglin gave speeches one after another, expressing their deep condolences, respect, and regret. Finally, Mr. Zhang Zhonghuan, a family member, gave a thank-you speech. The meeting ended after 5:00 PM. Ms. Zhu devoted herself to education for nearly 20 years, being calm and dignified, and without any of the habits of the present. Since she married Mr. Zhang, she has been able to serve the school on the one hand and handle family affairs on the other. The couple respected and encouraged each other and worked together on the cause of education. This summer, she died of an accident during childbirth, which is a pity not only for the women in our country but also a loss of talent for the education field in our country. It is said that the lady was good at Chinese studies, and there are still one volume each of poetry and prose collections. Mr. Zhang will soon print and publish them for the world.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Two Points Victory, Hujiang Breaks the Pirates <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-eight to Thirty-six Points</p>
<p>A Basketball Battle in Yangshupu</p>
<p>丨 Aid the Northeast Righteous Army丨</p>
<p>The Hujiang University basketball team defeated the Xiqing Pirates team, which has been dominating the sea for many years, by two points last night. The result was thirty-eight to thirty-six. The basketball stadium of the school in Yangshupu was crowded with people, mostly male and female students of the school. The proceeds from the ticket sales will be remitted to the Northeast to help the Righteous Army. Peng Sanmei executed the referee.</p>
<p>Hujiang Is Not Perfect. Hujiang's performance cannot be said to be disappointing, but it is not yet perfect. The cooperation skills seem to be improved. In the first ten minutes of the game, both sides were extremely panicked. Only people and horses were running around and bumping into each other blindly. After the people gradually calmed down, the ball situation suddenly became stagnant. The lack of preparation for shooting is the most disappointing. The opponent committed seven fouls, and only Feng Nianhua made two points. Among the forwards, Feng is still the most commendable, and the guards are average. At the beginning of the season, it is impossible to ask too much. You must know that the opponent is a strong enemy.</p>
<p>Pirates Are Always Terrible. Last night can be said to be one of the most subdued nights for the Pirates. The difference in throws under the basket was sixteen points. The number of hits is not satisfactory. Smith only hit two balls, which can be said to be a big deal. The reason is that the unfamiliarity of the field is one, and the four corners of the field are too low, so those who are not accustomed to it cannot shoot. Hujiang is not as fast as Hujiang in dribbling. There are more opportunities than Hujiang. The failure to hit is also due to the poor luck. The strength is terrible, and it cannot be taken lightly because of this defeat.</p>
<p>The Situation on the Court Is Tense. When the game started, the ball situation was fast and extremely tense. Smith first hit after a chaotic battle. Hujiang surpassed with eight to three. The Pirates tied with ten to ten. Unfortunately, Da Shigiya was slightly injured and out due to Sun Baoqing's collision. Xiqing was punished instead, so he showed shaking, but still maintained a tie of fourteen and sixteen. Hujiang won six points in the first half with twenty-two to sixteen through Feng Nianhua's two balls and Sun Baoqing's one shot.</p>
<p>A Difference in Mind for the Pirates. After the break, Hujiang hit two consecutive items in two minutes, one hit and then another, winning fifteen points with thirty-four to nineteen. The tense situation gradually returned to stability. The Pirates seemed to dislike the referee's bias, and they had a state of letting it go. This difference in mind led to failure.</p>
<p>Almost a Tie at the End. The Pirates' carelessness also led to Hujiang's relaxation. The actions of both sides were sometimes rough. The Pirates took the opportunity to advance at this time, and the score accumulated. Thirty-six to eight was only six points behind. There were still two minutes left in the game. Bernard Shigiya really added four points, only two points away. There was no one under Hujiang's basket, and Bernard's single shot failed. In a blink of an eye, the game ended, and Hujiang won with thirty-eight to thirty-six.</p>

<p>Women's Team: In the first half, Fudan scored 18, and Water and Electricity scored 10. As a result, Fudan won 25 to Water and Electricity's 21.</p>
<p>Men's Team: In the first half, Qingguang scored 12, and Fudan scored 11. As a result, both sides scored 30 points, a draw.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that tomorrow at 4 PM, the Fudan University volleyball team will compete with Hujiang to raise funds for the righteous army. The location is the Fudan University stadium. It is heard that Fudan's method of donating to the righteous army this time includes the school-wide team fundraising and the proceeds from the two basketball games. The results are quite impressive, and the volleyball tickets tomorrow are also for donating to the Northeast righteous army. It is heard that students and off-campus guests are very enthusiastic about buying tickets.</p>

<p>Original by Claire Burcky, Translated jointly by Zhang Guoxun and Qian Yiqin</p>
<p>Luuis Menzeo, the head basketball coach of Iowa State University, once broke the zone defense with the tactics recorded in this article.</p>
<p>However, when applying this method, the team members must be steady when receiving the ball, and they must attack with a swift and unexpected method to defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>Number 4 advances to the right wing of the opponent's defensive zone, then passes the ball to number 5. When number 5 is threatened by the opponent, he immediately dribbles quickly towards the free throw line, dribbles a few times, and then passes to number 3. Number 3 also rebounds and passes to number 2. If the speed of the ball is appropriate, then at this time, the only defender of numbers 1 and 2 is the opponent's left guard. At this time, if number 1 runs towards the corner, number 2 can dribble the ball towards the arc of the free throw area and shoot. If number 1 runs outside the arc of the free throw area, then number 2 can also dribble behind the defender and shoot.</p>

<h3 id="e115">All Citizens Should Receive Military Training <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>A couple brought a child to visit Old Man Xiang. Old Man Xiang said to them: Your good child should exercise their physique within ten years of age, so that they will be healthy in the future and be considered a citizen of Greater China! Because according to the current national crisis, judging from it, it is feared that it will cause the "Three Peoples" to govern together! One is the European people, the second is the American people, and the third is the so-called Japanese people, who will all come to bully us! Therefore, I have remembered the following important proposals.</p>
<p>Old Man Xiang mentioned that when he founded Aurora and Fudan, he hired instructors to teach military exercises, and students also had to practice shooting. He remembers very clearly that once, Shao Lizi fired three shots in a row and hit all three! Old Man Xiang was very happy when he talked about it. I wonder if Mr. Shao has forgotten this proud thing now?</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason for the proposal is not only to advocate universal conscription: because military training of children can call on citizens to have a spirit of exploration and adventure, and the energy to use their physique. So, how can the implementation be done? Briefly describe it.</p>
<p>The academic, industrial, and commercial circles have time in the afternoon: so from 5 PM to 7 PM, or 6 PM to 8 PM, they can hold exercises.</p>
<p>The agricultural sector can hold exercises in the first half of the day: because they can often get up early, as early as 5 AM to 7 AM, or 6 AM to 8 AM.</p>
<p>Men aged sixteen to forty have the obligation to serve in the military; those aged fifteen or sixteen, after graduating from middle school or elementary school, have the obligation to practice military exercises for one year.</p>
<p>Women have the obligation to practice nursing care and repairing military equipment.</p>
<p>In this way, the "Three Peoples" will not dare to govern China together! The important thing is implementation!</p>
<h3 id="e116">Continuing Anecdotes about Lin Sen <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Yangshan</p>
<p>丨Born as a Wireless Telegraph Student丨</p>
<p>A few days ago, there was an "Anecdote about Lin Sen" in Free Talk. I grew up in Rongcheng and know a lot about Chairman Lin's words and deeds. I will write down what I have seen and heard in a mess, just to imitate, not dare to compare.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin was originally a wireless telegraph student, but he gave up and served in the customs. "Heroes don't care about lowly origins." Foreign presidents have been tailors. I really admire the Chairman's environment and success!</p>
<p>He is sixty-five years old this year, and his spirit is very vigorous. He has been widowed for a long time and has no children. He built his own tomb in Guanjiang, Rongcheng, and his old home is in Shanggan Township in Inner Qili.</p>
<p>When the Guangdong army captured Min, he was once elected as the provincial governor. Order relied on him to maintain it. He soon gave up politics and retired to Qingzhi Temple in Guanjiang, which shows that he regarded wealth and fame as worthless.</p>
<p>The Chairman's official residence is in Shibanqiao, Nanjing. It is narrow and shabby, and the equipment is very simple. Except for a few boxes of calligraphy and paintings, there is nothing of value. It is said that he is quite fond of antiques, but he only seeks to be satisfied, and does not have to pay attention to quality.</p>
<p>He never recklessly recommends private individuals. This time when he returned to his hometown, some villagers asked him for a job. He wrote the eight characters "A gentleman is steadfast in poverty, and his career is often difficult" to encourage them, and advised them to engage in agriculture and industry to solve their livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Two Female Novel Fans <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Wulang</p>
<p>丨Influenced by Dream of the Red Chamber and A Twosome in Laughter and Tears丨</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Cheng Xiaoqing once told me in person that when one of his works was published in the newspaper on a daily basis, a female teacher collected these newspapers every day. One day, she accidentally lost one, and she was so angry that she did not eat that day. It can be seen that the charming power of detective novels is really not small, as great as the charming power of martial arts novels, but romantic novels are more likely to fascinate people. The following are stories of two people who are obsessed with romantic novels.</p>
<p>One of them, I only know her surname is Shen, because she is my neighbor. Her family calls her Miss Two. She loves to read Dream of the Red Chamber. Usually, you can hear her reciting the songs and poems of Dream of the Red Chamber in a loud voice. She got married the year before last. Still in the honeymoon of the wedding, a relative living near her husband's house sent interesting news. It turned out that one day, only a week after her marriage, she and her new husband closed the door of the new house. She lay on the bed and sobbed, crying more and more sadly, and crying louder and louder. Her parents-in-law heard the new daughter-in-law crying, and only thought that their son was bullying her in some way, so they rushed to order them to open the door, went in and asked the reason, but their son replied with a smile: "She is pretending to be Lin Daiyu, teaching me to learn from Jia Baoyu to persuade her, there is nothing else." Her parents-in-law forgave her because she was a new daughter-in-law, but they couldn't help but smile wryly. Since then, her sisters-in-law have called her "Crazy Miss."</p>
<p>There is also a female classmate from my former alma mater, who was fascinated by the novel "A Twosome in Laughter and Tears." This spring, she married one of my colleagues, who is a handsome young man. In her eyes, he is really comparable to Fan Jashu in "A Twosome in Laughter and Tears." She usually regards herself as He Lina. Sometimes when I go to his house, I call them "Mr. Fan" and "Miss He" as a joke. But she is really interesting. She calls me "Mr. Tao," it turns out that she also stubbornly made me play the role of Tao Bohe. After the "A Twosome in Laughter and Tears" film of the Star Company was released, I invited them to watch it twice, but the sincere and moving performances in the film made her even more fascinated. This colleague has told me secretly several times, "Your female classmate is really crazy, always complaining that I am a useless Fan Jashu, and there is no Shen Fengxi and Guan Xiugu, isn't it funny." Once, this colleague accidentally accompanied people to drink fancy wine because of socializing, but she detected it. The couple made a scene. After I learned this news, I went to persuade her, and I jokingly said, "Don't you want your Fan Jashu to have a Shen Fengxi?" She replied angrily: "Aren't Shen Fengxi and He Lina the same person?" (In the film, Hu Die plays both Shen Fengxi and He Lina.)</p>
<h3 id="e118">Poetry of Humanity <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Zaidong</p>
<p>丨Makes People Startled and Horrified丨</p>
<p>Humanity depicts the prosperity of the city on one side, promoting the depravity of young people, and on the other side, it captures the reality of the Shaanxi disaster, expressing the difficulties of agriculture. Inserting poems in the middle makes people startled and horrified, so the poems were recited for a while. Some students came to ask about the origin of the poems. I remember two of them and describe them as follows:</p>
<p>Hoeing millet under the midday sun, sweat dripping onto the soil, know that the food in the plate, every grain is hard-won. This is a poem by Nie Yizhong of the Late Tang Dynasty. The poetic realm of the Late Tang Dynasty is not high, and Nie also has no poetic reputation. Because Emperor Mingzong Li Siyuan of the Later Tang Dynasty, a barbarian who claimed to be emperor, and Prime Minister Feng Dao, cited this poem in his response, intending to advise him to stop fighting and care for agriculture. Later, Sima Guang's General Mirror and Zhu Xi's Outline all adopted this passage of response, so the poem spread among the population. At that time, Feng Dao cited another poem, which said: "Selling new silk in February, selling new grain in May, treating the sores in front of you, cutting off the flesh in your heart." It also described the suffering of farmers.</p>
<p>"Behind vermillion gates, meat and wine rot, on the road lie frozen corpses." This is a poem by Du Gongbu in his Northern Expedition. This poem has a hundred rhymes in five words and is a masterpiece in Du's collection. The poem describes the Tianbao Rebellion and the individual's journey home, as well as his feelings and ambitions, which is now called the realist school of literature. These two sentences are angry words about the inequality of wealth and happiness, and are no less than a portrayal of Shanghai today. Those who read it without being alarmed are not human. I believe that Du is called the saint of poetry, with all kinds of beauty. Reading his poetry can lead to writing essays and novels, and writing scripts. It is not necessary to write poetry. The "Du Shi Jing Quan" is the best for compiling annual annotations of his poems.</p>
<p>I say this because the historical materials of our country are very rich, and literature is indeed valuable. I hope that our young people, in their spare time from science classes, may wish to choose and purchase several kinds of classics, histories, philosophers, and collections to browse and entertain, which is equivalent to reading novels and magazines. After reading a lot, they will definitely arouse interest and benefit their knowledge. I hope they will not have preconceived notions and reject them without reading. When applying them, quoting European poems and American proverbs is also good in Western languages, but how can Chinese people not be interested?</p>

<p>— Fan Yanqiao</p>
<p>She sang each word in a low, melodious, mournful, and well-modulated Suzhou dialect, and each word passed from the cold air to Third Aunt's eardrums, touching her heartstrings, and she heard her lower her head, silently, as if shedding tears there, because the faint moonlight shone on her teardrops, flickering with light, which Ai Gu saw, very surprised, and asked:</p>
<p>"Crying? Why? I won't sing anymore, so as not to make you sad."</p>
<p>"No! No! You sing, you sing, I accidentally thought of something, and I couldn't help but feel a little sad. I don't want to think about it, you sing!" Third Aunt quickly raised her head, stopped the remaining tears, secretly wiped them with her sleeves, and stated forcefully.</p>
<p>"Third Aunt, what did you think of? Would you tell me?"</p>
<p>"To be honest, every sentence you sing is what I have experienced, it seems. You use a needle to prick the scars I have suffered, how can I not be doubly painful. Ai Gu, remember, if you are unfortunate enough to be a woman in the next life, you would rather be a cat in a wealthy family than a daughter-in-law in a farming family." Third Aunt's head went down again, and the moonlight shone on the tear stains on her face again.</p>
<p>"Ah!………what!………"</p>
<p>Ai Gu was still a fifteen-year-old girl, not knowing the seriousness, and actually cried out loud in this quiet space that was easy for people to hear. Unfortunately, her parents-in-law and young husband all came, although there were no "sharp-tongued girls" or "short uncles," but the scolding of her parents-in-law was enough to scare her little courage.</p>
<p>"What the hell are you crying about in the middle of the night! What a jinx!"</p>
<p>"Little whore!… Are you also singing Tan Huang and crying Qiqi?!"</p>
<p>Two different comments from different standpoints, under the stern voice and expression, scared Third Aunt to be uneasy, and she had to stand up from the threshold, force a smile, and greet them:</p>
<p>"Uncle Liu!… Big Sister-in-law!… Are you done? I heard you were a little tired, so I came over here and saw your Ai Gu outside the door, afraid that she was lonely, so I chatted with her. It's ridiculous that she is really timid. I told her a story about a zombie, and she was so scared that she cried." Liu's wife said very cheerfully: "Hum… Third Aunt! No need to cover up for her! When we walked on the ridge, we still heard her singing folk songs, I don't know what she is thinking about again, and started crying. Third Aunt! It's getting late, I'll tell you tomorrow, I have a lot to say."</p>
<p>Third Aunt saw that she had caused trouble, so she took the opportunity to say: "See you tomorrow!" She knew in her heart that she had to leave as soon as possible, and she seemed to vaguely hear many unusual conversations, some high and some low, behind her, but she didn't want to bother to distinguish whether they were scolding her.</p>
<p>……………………………………………………………………</p>
<p>The next day, Liu's wife came to Third Aunt's house in person. Third Aunt was startled at first, but then she thought, anyway, she is a widow, not afraid of people coming to bully her, and she usually has a reputation for being "difficult to mess with," so she treated Liu's wife as an equal. In the process of serving tea, wiping the table, and dusting the bamboo building, she said a few unimportant words of small talk, and then talked about the question of "why are you here?" Liu's wife sighed first, took a sip of tea, and said:</p>
<p>"After you left last night, that damn girl sulked, and after a night, she is still hanging a jar of vinegar on her face today."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Gold Prices Plummet <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Sharp Drop of Eleven Taels and Three Mace: The market yesterday suddenly became weak and the changes were very drastic. The wind and waves in the morning market were shocking, and the unexpected drop was as much as fourteen taels. Initially, the silver market declined slightly and owed a lot, and it was expected that the large margin should have fallen but did not. Although the reason was that the United States was dumping, people's hearts were not stimulated, so the market opened with a slight drop, and then stabilized. Until the foreign exchange rate contracted by half a grade, it then revealed a state of weakness. Near noon, suddenly Guang Bang Hengxing sold off in droves (bulls came out of the cage, and Hengyu acted as the agent for the sale). The selling wind in the market suddenly intensified, and the exchange rate also turned sluggish. There was a big wave, and the market price almost fell by a thousand feet, breaking through 750 taels and finally seeing 44 taels. There was also a rumor that Japan intended to switch to the silver standard. Afterwards, buyers slightly moved, and then pulled up three or four taels. The afternoon market was still flat, but with a difference of only two or three taels, and there was not much volume of trading. As a result, it stood at 47 taels, a sharp drop of eleven taels and zero compared to the previous day. In November, Ruixing, the short seller, had dropped 140 bars into Tongfeng Heng, paying out 2 taels and 7 mace. The detailed situation of the front and rear markets is recorded below:</p>
<p>Buying Wind Flared Before Noon Closing: The December opening immediately fell by one tael and one mace to 757 taels and two mace. The silver market was flat in England and the United States, but the private telegram only fell by one-sixteenth, and the exchange rate fell in England and rose in the United States, and people's hearts were immediately weak. Yu Yuanyuan Kangxiang and others sold, and it fell to 6 taels and two mace again, and the US dollar was flat, and 75 could be settled in January, and 6875 in December. Then, because HSBC bought 75 in January, and Dadecheng Bingxing Yongfeng bought in ten markets, it was raised to 7 taels and eight mace. At that time, Hengxing slightly sold on behalf of customers, so it depreciated by seven or eight mace. At 9:30, the HSBC exchange rate was announced, and England and the United States each contracted by 125, which was 7 taels and seven mace. Subsequently, Yifeng Yongheng Yu Zhaofengchang and others sold, and Huabi and others sold US dollars for 8125 in January and 75 in November, and then 8125 in December. The gold price seemed to be falling, and the situation was peaceful until 10:30 at 55 taels. Unexpectedly, Hengyu Zhifengyong sold out, and it was Hengxing who came out of the cage. On behalf of each company, they sold according to the trend. In an instant, there was a storm in the market, full of clouds of sorrow. The various parties were greatly panicked, and the exchange market also sought easy supply because of the sales of Dalian Bang and other companies. The bank's buying appetite stagnated, and the gold price fell further to 50 taels before 11:00, which was 49 taels and two mace. Not long after, Fuchang, Yuantai, Futaixing, Yuanfeng, Yongyuan, Mao Yonghong, Kangyong and others took this opportunity to buy, pulling up two or so, which was 50 taels and zero four mace. However, the rumor that Japan had reformed its finances and intended to use the silver standard was even more prevalent in people's hearts. Hengyu continued to sell on behalf of Hengxing and other customers. Zhifengyong, Daxingyong, Bingxing, Dadecheng, Yuanchun, Wanxing and others scrambled to sell, and the bank's buying price of US dollars in February was 30 yuan and 25 cents, and 125 in January. Therefore, it did not fall by more than six taels in 20 minutes, and at 11:30 it was 44 taels, and in an instant it returned to three or four taels, because the bank had absorbed 0625 in January and 30 yuan in December, and because Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Yuanmaoyong, Yuantai, Wanxingshunli and others scrambled to buy, Hengxing also entered on behalf of customers, and general short sellers took this opportunity to quickly cover, so that the market price suddenly increased by four taels, and at 11:30 it was 48 taels. At that time, it was suppressed by a small two taels again, because Hengyu continued to sell, and at 11:45 it was 46 taels, and then the selling wind began to subside, at 7 taels and 56 mace, until noon closing at 7 taels and two mace.</p>
<p>Not Much Volume in Afternoon Market: The opening price in the afternoon market was 7 taels and eight mace, followed by 6 taels and two mace. Hengyu and Fuyu sold, and suddenly the wheat bank absorbed US dollars at 0625 in January, and the banks did 8125 in December. The silver company came to absorb US dollars at 0625 in January, and then HSBC absorbed 9375 in December, and Dadecheng Yifengyong Zhaofengchang Yongfeng scrambled to buy, and at 2:20 it was 8 taels and two mace. For a moment, Hengyu Fuyu Zhifengyong Zhaofengchang and Hengxing acted as agents for customers to sell, and the wheat bank sold 30 yuan in December. Near 3 o'clock, it finally became 44 and a half taels. Afterwards, Zhifengyong Hengyu Hongxing Yuanmaoyong Qianchang Xianglai entered, and Anda absorbed US dollars at 1875 in February, which was hedging the exchange rate, so the gold price rose by three taels, and at 3:45 it was 7 taels and seven mace. Hengxing came out again, and then it was five and a half taels. By 4 o'clock, Qian Changxiang Bingxing Richang and other items were bought, so it rose by more than two taels again. The final 7 taels and three mace, at 4:30 the market closed at 47 taels, a sharp drop of eleven taels and three mace compared to the previous day, with the largest throughout the day being 57 taels and eight mace and the smallest being 44 taels, a difference of thirteen taels and eight mace, and the naked margin was calculated to be eleven and a half taels.</p>
<p>Posted Prices Suppressed by More Than Fourteen Taels: The posted price was a small 125 in US dollars, so it was 820 taels, and the discount was 623 taels, then 76 taels, the noon closing was 73 taels, the afternoon was 734 taels, to 72 taels, and then to 76 taels, and finally 73 taels, which was more than fourteen taels more than the previous day, and the hedging was slightly farther away, with the books registered at 49 taels, 47 taels, and the supplementary water at 49 taels in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>Transactions Were Smooth: Transactions on the counter were smooth, but the demand for supply was different. Statistics show that Yuanmaoyong and Fuchang each entered about 1,000, and Qianchangxiang Yongfeng Shunli Wanxing Yuanmaoyu Yuantai Zhaofengchang Yuankangxiang Yifengyong all entered, Yifeng entered three to four hundred, Daxingyong Yuanxingyong Richang and Dayicheng all exited, Zhifengyong exited seven to eight hundred bars, Hengyu exited one thousand six to seven hundred bars, and Bingxing Fuyu Tongtaichang entered and exited differently. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong Yifengyong Bingxing Yuanmaoyu Shunli and Dadecheng all entered, and Fuyu Hengyu and retail investors all exited, and those who hedged the exchange rate exited and re-entered. Dalian Bang entered a total of more than eight hundred and exited more than four hundred. Guang Bang Hengxing was represented by Heng Yuzhifengyong to exit three thousand and several hundred bars, and also bought more than one hundred bars on behalf of customers. In the afternoon, it sold another two hundred and several tens of bars on behalf of customers. The total amount of bars for each company was about 24,000 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Foreign Exchange Spot and Forward Rates Slightly Different <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market declined slightly, exchange rates for British pounds contracted, and U.S. dollars rose. However, the spot and forward exchange markets in this port were slightly different. The HSBC listed price decreased by half a point, with British and U.S. currencies each at 1.25. All other rates increased, except for Hong Kong dollars. This likely indicates changes in the domestic market. Prices were stable in the morning but loosened later, returning to stability at noon. In the afternoon, there were slight fluctuations. As a result, the British pound increased by 0.125 compared to the previous day, and the U.S. dollar increased by 0.03125. However, this was not as drastic as the sharp decline in the gold market, so hedging opportunities were slightly further apart than before. Selling spot gold now can hedge approximately 50 taels, while hedging forward with exchange drafts costs about 43 or 44 taels, resulting in a closing price exceeding 70 taels. Trading was quite active yesterday, with only about £100,000 in British pounds traded. The Guangdong banks were the main sellers, with various banks engaging in offsetting trades. Approximately one million U.S. dollars were traded. In the morning, the Jinjiang banks first bought and then sold due to the falling price of gold. Later in the day, they sold slightly, with significant offsetting trades by banks. Silver companies bought for January, and the Dalian banks bought, leading Dalian to sell U.S. dollars. Guangdong banks also sold U.S. dollars. However, the banks' appetite for buying was insufficient, making it difficult to sell, so they turned to selling margin gold, causing prices to plummet. In the afternoon, Anda bought $18,750 in February U.S. dollars, offering a rate of 93.75 shillings, hedging the British-U.S. exchange rate at US$3.31375.</p>
<p>British Pound Exchange Rate: The domestic market saw a fluctuation of 0.1875 throughout the morning and afternoon sessions. The opening selling prices were 1 shilling 9.5625 pence for November, 625 pence for December, 6875 pence for January, and 75 pence for February. The buying prices were 0625 pence higher. At noon, the closing selling prices were 9.75 to 9.9375 pence, and the buying prices were 8.8125 to 10 pence. In the afternoon, Banque Belge and Anda traded December at 9.8125 pence. Anda sold February at 8125 pence. (Chengfeng Yong entered). Closing selling prices were 9.75 to 9.9375 pence, and buying prices were 8.8125 to 10 pence.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar Exchange Rate: The domestic market fluctuated by 0.0375 throughout the day. The opening selling prices were 29.5625 yuan for November, 625 yuan for December, 6875 yuan for January, and 75 yuan for February. The buying prices were 6875 to 875 yuan. Macquarie sold December at 29.625 yuan. Anda sold January at 75 yuan. Shanghai Zhongfu offset February at 875 yuan. Meifeng sold February at 875 yuan, entering January at 8125 yuan. Banque Belge sold January at 8125 yuan. Citibank and Banque Belge sold December at 8125 yuan and entered February at 30.125 yuan. Zhongfu bought December at 30 yuan. Zhejiang absorbed January at 125 yuan. At noon, the selling prices were 29.875 to 30.0625 yuan, and the buying prices were 30 to 30.1875 yuan. In the afternoon, Macquarie bought January at 30.0625 yuan, HSBC took January at 9375 yuan (Shengda entered). Bank of America entered January at 0625 yuan. Macquarie and HSBC both absorbed December at 9375 yuan. Macquarie also entered February at 125 yuan and sold November at 9375 yuan to Zhejiang. Meifeng sold and Macquarie bought February at 1875 yuan. Banque Belge and Pan Gen both entered February at 1875 yuan. Anda took February at 1875 yuan (Chengfeng Yong sold). Zhongfu and Shanghai entered February at 1875 yuan. Zhejiang and Meifeng took December at 30 yuan. Anda took February at 125 yuan. Zhejiang entered February at 1875 yuan. The closing selling prices were 29.875 to 30.0625 yuan, and the buying prices were 30 to 30.1875 yuan. Additionally, one U.S. dollar was equivalent to 3 taels, 4 qian, 1 fen, and 8.8 li of silver.</p>

<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 1st reported that near-term large bars of silver were slightly longer, closing at 18 and 1875 pence, up 0.0625 from the previous day. Distant-term was unchanged, remaining at 18 and 25 pence. The British-U.S. exchange rate opened at $3.28875.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Small Silver Coins Rise Slightly, Then Decline Again <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver market situation remained loose as before, with no hope of prosperity. There are genuine fears that this situation will never reverse. The market price of small silver coins was slightly better yesterday morning, appearing about 0.001 better than the previous day. However, due to the prevalence of "floating heads," it failed to surge, and eventually trended downwards. However, customer sales were not very smooth, and supply and demand were uneven in this street, so there should be no major changes in the current situation.</p>

<p>丨Minor Fluctuations with Both Increases and Decreases丨</p>
<p>Yesterday (November 1st), in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, among the various bond markets, only the December term of the "Disbandment of Troops" bond saw some trading; other bonds saw no market activity. The November term was quite active in the morning session, with sustained enthusiasm, and turnover reached over 3.3 million. However, the market stabilized in the afternoon session, and the market situation was calm, with transaction volume decreasing to only 1.9 million between the two sessions, totaling 5.535 million yuan. Among these, the "Disbandment of Troops" bond accounted for about 900,000, the Salt Tax bond accounted for 1.14 million, the Unified Tax bond accounted for 710,000, and other bonds also performed well. However, the "Consolidated Six" and Financial bonds were relatively quiet. Spot trading was scarce, with only 7,100 yuan in volume for the entire day. As for the trend in bond prices, the buying sentiment was stronger in the morning sessions, with scattered purchases from various parties. Prices were slightly higher than the previous day, with increases of around 0.03 or 0.04 yuan. The buying sentiment suddenly turned calm in the afternoon session, and prices declined. However, selling was also rare, so although prices trended downwards, the fluctuations were peaceful. As a result, there were mixed increases and decreases compared to the previous day, with the amounts being minor. Notably, the spot price of the "Disbandment of Troops Two Zero" bond was significantly higher than the previous week.</p>

<p>丨Seen Only Once in Eight Years丨</p>
<p>Sin Fung Foreign Firm reported that on Monday (31st), the New York Stock Exchange was the quietest it has been in eight years. The total daily trading volume was only 400,000 shares. Because the election is imminent and industry and commerce remain sluggish, besides a few professional speculators who are slightly active, the public does not want to trade. It is expected that the stock market will continue to be quiet this week, and prices will not fluctuate significantly. The closing prices of several stocks are listed below: Adam Trust 5.75, Chase Bank 35, Citibank 43.75, American Foreign Power 7.75, American Can 5.1, National Southern Public Utilities 3, Curtiss Aircraft 2, Electric Bond and Share 8, International Harvester 21, Paramount Pictures 2, Packard Motor Car 2.875, Standard Oil of New Jersey 9.5, Union Pacific Railroad 65, Warner Brothers 2, and American Copper and Brass 35.625.

<p>The cotton yarn market is extremely scattered, presenting a desolate and lonely scene. Market transactions are quite quiet, with no sign of revitalization. The actual needs of the customer groups are decreasing, and all groups are stagnant due to the economic emergency. As for the overseas cotton market, it is weak and sluggish, which makes people even more weak-hearted, and most tend to sell. However, a certain country's yarn has risen by 4 or 5 yuan.</p>
<p>Sparse and Faint Human Standard Transactions: In the morning opening of the Human Standard, the situation was quite weak due to the fatigue and lack of vigor of American cotton. However, there were very few transactions in the market, with each month's term rising by 0.0013 yuan. In the afternoon, there were no increases or decreases in each month's term. The total daily transaction statistics were 11,100 bales. It was found that 1,450 bales of Mingde were sold, 600 bales of Taichang were sold, and 600 bales of Shenji were sold. 450 bales of Shenchang were bought, 400 bales of Yichang were bought, 450 bales of Renfeng were bought, 600 bales of Changfeng were bought, and 550 bales of Changji were bought.

<p>The cotton market is dull, and people are relaxed because American cotton is slightly lower, domestic yarn sales are sluggish, financial conditions are difficult to loosen, and factories have no intention of handling raw cotton. As a result, the spot cotton business is very quiet, but the sources from various routes are not active, and rural farmers insist on not selling cheaply, so there is a shortage of new sales. However, the surrounding environment is deteriorating, and the base is small, so the prospects are unpredictable.</p>
<p>Ordinary Zheng Standard: The Zheng Standard market opened in the morning, with the market situation being even weaker due to the smaller American cotton. However, there were not many sellers, and the distant months rose by 0.0005 yuan. The afternoon was average, with a total daily turnover of 35,000 dan. It was found that 4,100 dan of Changhe were sold, 1,600 dan of Mingde were sold, 1,800 dan of Dachang were sold, 1,400 dan of Suilong were sold, and 1,400 dan of Changfeng were sold. 3,100 dan of Gengfeng were bought, 1,000 dan of Renfeng were bought, 900 dan of Hengchang were bought, and 700 dan of Huocheng were bought.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm. Later, it weakened due to Southern hedging sales and long positions liquidating. Term delivery fell by 0.04 to 0.06 pounds per point. Spot goods fell by 0.05 pounds per point. British cotton futures fell by 11 points, and spot goods fell by 13 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 16 points.

<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, there were many boats from the Pu River area, about 30 or more. Trading in this street was more active than in the previous market. The Suzhou-Tongxiang groups slightly hoarded, and the market continued to increase by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. Bai Ge, Yaozhong wild rice, old broken goods, etc. were all settled. Lu Yangjian was weak, and the situation appeared loose.</p>
<p>New Gate: Recently, there have been many sources from the mainland, and the river bottoms are abundant. City and rural shops have a tepid attitude. Old and broken white rice is short by nearly 0.1 yuan. New, thin rice and Feilai Feng rice sales are average, and the market has no rise or fall. Kunshan and Jiangyin rice customers had a few dealings, and the price hardened by 0.0005 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Foreign Xiang Rice Sales Stalled <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign Xiang rice market situation turned stagnant because the arrival of various river Jingjian rice at the head was very prosperous, and the price also fell sharply. This street's purchases were all focused on river rice, and no one paid attention to foreign rice. The customer group originally had purchases, but because the river rice fell sharply, they also watched and held back, hoping that the price would drop a little before inquiring again. Therefore, there were no bag transactions in the entire morning and afternoon markets, and people's hearts were tired.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Bean Noodle Market Turns Bullish in the Afternoon <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday in the bean noodle market, the market situation for each month saw a period of weakness after the morning opening. Because the foreign wheat quotations shrank by about 0.04 to 0.06 yuan, people's hearts were naturally depressed. This month fell to 0.076 yuan, December fell to 0.074 yuan, January fell to 0.072 yuan, February fell to 0.07225 yuan, and March fell to 0.07375 yuan, falling about 0.01 yuan compared to the previous month's close. However, afterwards, the attitudes of each factory in each market were all cautious, and there were very few sales. Temporary speculation again thought of raising prices, so each month gradually rebounded by over 0.01 yuan. Until the afternoon opening, the factory sales were very quiet. Also, although this month's standard was cheap, Fuxin's spot goods were still calling for 1.92 yuan with deductions, Fufeng was calling for 0.008 yuan higher than the standard, and the rest were also ranging from 0.006 to 0.004 yuan. For the distant term, both foreign customer groups also had intakes, so the market situation turned bullish. However, the pricing of Australian wheat was 3.53 yuan. The foreign firms were willing to sell, but the factories did not dare to set prices again, so although the market was slightly better, the environment was still bad. As a result, this month was 0.0125 yuan better than the previous month's end, December rose by 0.0225 yuan, January was 0.05 yuan better, February was 0.0025 yuan better, March was unchanged, and April had also opened, down 0.0005 yuan compared to the initial opening.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Wheat Falls in the Morning, Recovers in the Afternoon <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the term wheat market in the morning, each month generally presented a falling look. Because the foreign wheat quotations continued to shrink by 0.04 to 0.06 yuan, and the overseas oversupply situation became more and more obvious, people's hearts were all dimmed and unhappy. Although transactions were not very smooth, the near and distant terms fell by 0.02 to 0.06 yuan. Until the afternoon opening, the November and December transactions were still quiet, and the distant terms were lively because the bean noodle market had been tired and recovered, and speculative customers had also taken in, and the opening prices of each month rebounded a lot compared to the morning. As a result, only January fell by 0.0002 yuan compared to the previous month, and the rest were unchanged. The April opening price was 3.26 yuan, and the later market rose 0.0002 yuan. Spot wheat had no sales due to the two-sided market being quiet, and there were no openings.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Chicago Wheat Still Weak <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Sin Fung Foreign Firm reported that on Monday (31st), the Chicago wheat decline had not stopped. First, because Canadian wheat was weak, the December term fell by 0.01 yuan, creating a new low of 43.125. Afterwards, wheat brokers bought vigorously, and the price rebounded. As a result, it was slightly less than the previous day. Also, on the 29th, a total of 20 million bushels were traded. The market quotations on the 31st are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Closing Price | Change from Previous Day</p>

<p>December Term | 49.375 | Unchanged</p>

<p>Danyang is also a silk region. Because the official government distributed improved breeds this year's autumn silkworms, and sent people to guide feeding, the harvest was still good. Because the silkworm farmers saw that the cocoon price was not high, those who reeled native silk themselves have new autumn silk entering the market. The silk quality is excellent. Unfortunately, the silk door's sales appetite is not rising, and the foreign shops and factory managers' sales prices are strangely small, resulting in low native silk opening prices. According to a letter from the production area yesterday, the highest price for new silk is only 34 yuan per 100 taels. The silkworm farmers' cocoon costs are losing money.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port became more and more quiet. Silk sales in New York and Lyon were sluggish. The term silk telegrams sent overseas in the middle of last week had not yet been forwarded to Shanghai yesterday morning. Both Chinese and foreign silk merchants maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, Ni Taihe entered 10 packages of Yizuru brand top-grade dry white silk, with the price set at 465 taels. Boxin entered 8 packages of Guopen top-grade 26-28 thread yellow shaken silk, with the price set at 420 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday in the foreign tea market in this port, the fine eyebrow and pearl tea from Lai Lu Zhuang, Jinlong, Tongfu, Xiehe, Baochang, and other firms all started handling, and negotiations between Chinese and foreign parties were endless. The market was slightly lively because foreign firms sent out a large number of telegrams last week, and a large part of them have been answered. However, because the prices coming from Morocco are too low, Chinese merchants cannot easily comply due to excessive losses. Transactions of ordinary Zhuang goods were still scarce. Fine eyebrow and Xiu eyebrow also had slightly more sales. The market remained flat. Regarding Gongxi, the Russian AID Association Foreign Firm, which had purchased goods several weeks ago, is preparing to sort and ship them, so transactions are quite desolate.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Sugar Market: Coarse White, Dutch Red, and Marked Prices Slightly Soft <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a softening market due to falling margin gold. The Association's marked prices were slightly looser, with the rough sand white ex-warehouse price being 14.95 yuan and the high-quality goods being 15.05 yuan, unchanged. The 18th grade medium sand white trend was also thinner, with a marked price of 14.1 yuan, down 0.01 yuan from the previous day. The 20th grade medium sand white was stable due to a shortage of goods, remaining at 14.4 yuan. The Dutch red had minor increases and decreases. The old 8th grade was marked at 11.1 yuan, down 0.01 yuan. The old 9th grade Dutch red was marked at 11.5 yuan, and the old 10th grade was 11.6 yuan, down 0.01 yuan. The Huaxin Foreign Firm's old red sand road goods had already traded 13,000 bags yesterday. The buyers were still enthusiastic, and the price was 4 Dutch guilders, up 0.1 guilders from November. (Yesterday's report that Huaxin road goods Dutch red were asking for 4 guilders was mistakenly printed as 40 yuan and should be corrected).</p>

<p>The Stone Pier sun-dried longan meat produced in Zhangzhou had fallen to 40 yuan due to the abundant harvest of Guilin longan this year. Last week, an external group purchased in Zhangzhou, and the price gradually rose to 45 yuan. According to a letter yesterday, because a portion of the Guilin longan in the production area had small grains and low prices for labor, the cargo owners had given up on harvesting them. The harvested goods had also been damaged due to rain and insufficient drying. Therefore, the market has recovered and risen, and the sun-dried meat has risen again to 47-48 yuan.</p>

<p>丨Dried Scallops Scarce and Popular丨</p>
<p>Dried Shrimp Tails: Customer sales are stagnant, and market prices are gradually loosening. Fortunately, there is not much inventory, so there has not been a big drop. Yesterday's listed prices opened at six boxes of new Jin Gou tails at 107 taels, nine buckets of Jin Shan tails at 87.5 taels, four buckets of old goods at 76 taels, and eight pieces of screened Xiang Shan tails at 60.08 taels. Because of sluggish customer sales, traders are less willing to hoard them, but the market in each stall has loosened by 0.08 or 0.09 taels, or 0.05 or 0.06 taels compared to the previous period.</p>
<p>Dried Scallops: The sources for each stall are very scarce, and street inventory is also rare. Customer sales are strong, and there is a risk of having less goods to supply the market. Medium-sized Yantai goods are currently selling for 54 taels, small-sized goods are selling for 46 taels, medium-sized Fujian goods are selling for 78 taels, and large-sized Jiangbei goods are selling for 35 taels. All are tightly traded.</p>

<p>British Cotton Industry: Since the cotton mills in Manchester experienced labor unrest in the summer, there has been a decline. However, according to the latest report, the cotton cloth export trade is in good condition. It is estimated that from January to September of this year, the British cotton cloth export volume was 1.7 billion square yards, an increase of about 24% compared to last year. The reason for the increase in British cloth exports this year is that exports to the two major markets of India and China reached 115 million square yards, more than doubling compared to the same period last year. The exports to India were 465 million square yards, an increase of 5% or more compared to the same period last year. In particular, the export volume to India in September was the highest record of this year, reaching as much as 60 million square yards. This is the result of India's implementation of the new cotton cloth tax system. In addition, exports to Asia, South Africa, and India were also not small, especially the exports to Africa.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Shanghai Business Association and Over Two Hundred Other Public Groups Held a Farewell Reception for Weng Zhaoyuan Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Weng Offered "Saving the Nation Through Aviation" as a Parting Message</p>
<p>Various Public Groups Telegraphed the Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce to Request a Welcome</p>
<p>General Weng Zhaoyuan, Brigade Commander of the 156th Brigade of the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, has decided to set sail today on the American liner President Madison. Mr. Weng boarded the ship at 9:00 PM last night. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, over two hundred public groups in the city held a farewell reception at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, attended by hundreds of people from all walks of life in the city, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and Wen Hongen. Mr. Yu, Mr. Wang, and others delivered farewell speeches. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: There were many attendees yesterday, reaching over three hundred people, including Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Wang Yansong, and Wang Xiaolai from the Shanghai business community; Lin Kanghou from the banking sector; Wen Hongen, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau; Yin Zhiling from various national salvation associations; Wu Mai from the National Lawyers Association; Zhou Xuexiang, Chen Peide, and Chen Yafu from the General Labor Union; Wang Zhaocheng from the Citizens' Federation; Pei Yunqing from the Money Trade Association; Guo Shun from the Municipal Council, and General Weng Zhaoyuan. General Weng Zhaoyuan arrived at the venue at 3:00 PM, and the meeting commenced immediately, with Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Wen Lanting, Zhang Yichen, Zhang Zilian, Li Yongxiang, and Wang Zhaocheng serving as the presidium.</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda: (1) Ringing the bell to begin the meeting; (2) Publicly electing the presidium; (3) The chairperson reporting the purpose of the meeting; (4) The chairperson reading the farewell address; (5) General Weng delivering a speech; (6) Taking a photograph; (7) Entertainment, Scout performance; (8) Playing military music; (9) Completion of the ceremony and adjournment.</p>
<p>Chairperson's Report: After the ceremonial procedures, the chairperson Wang Xiaolai first reported, saying, "Today, various groups in Shanghai are holding this meeting to bid farewell to Brigade Commander Weng as he goes abroad. This is truly because of Brigade Commander Weng's great achievements during the January 28th Shanghai Incident, which had a life-and-death relationship with our people. The reason for Brigade Commander Weng's trip abroad is, on the one hand, to represent the 19th Route Army in thanking the overseas Chinese in Nanyang for their enthusiastic assistance during the Shanghai Incident, and on the other hand, because Mr. Weng deeply understands that in modern warfare, air power is as important as naval and land forces. He resolutely goes abroad to study the aviation industries of various countries in order to implement the principle of saving the nation through aviation. We are moved by the greatness of Mr. Weng's trip abroad, and therefore hold this meeting to bid him farewell. When Brigade Commander Weng was bravely defending Wusong, he fell from an airplane three times but remained safe. This shows that Brigade Commander Weng's patriotism is sincere and moves the heavens."</p>

<p>Farewell Address: Next, Wang Yansong, representing the farewell group, delivered a farewell address, saying, "Our beloved General Weng Zhaoyuan will, in November of the 21st year of the Republic of China, be entrusted by the 19th Route Army and the Chinese Aviation Construction Association to go abroad and convey their mission. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and over a hundred other public groups are therefore bidding him farewell, shedding tears of sorrow, expressing fervent hopes, and writing words of utmost affection as a gift, wishing that the General would accept and cherish them with sincerity. Since the invasion of the violent bandits, our Northeast has been occupied for more than a year. During this period of over a year, although the national crisis remains profound, our national strength to resist the enemy has become clear. Those who are rampaging and killing in the Northeast today are all the enemy's elite. We are defending against them with righteous people who lack both weapons and ammunition, yet we have already made them weary and running for their lives. During the January 28th Incident, when tens of thousands of enemy troops wreaked havoc in Shanghai, we relied on troops who regarded death as their return and forced them to retreat. Not only that, but when the General was defending Wusong, the forts were destroyed, and all defenses were exhausted. What he relied on to fight the enemy were only the blood and flesh of five hundred elite soldiers. The enemy ships that surrounded and attacked, and the airplanes that bombed, were all unable to use their violence to the fullest extent. Moreover, as the General retreated, they knew what to fear and dared not pursue him relentlessly. If we had the same weapons as them, the enemy would surely collapse at the mere sight of us. Now, the General is about to depart. We hope that he will fulfill his mission, exert his utmost efforts, and sincerely express our gratitude to the overseas Chinese, and rely on the strength of the overseas Chinese to complete the construction of aviation, internally to restore our national territory and protect our nation, and externally to alert the international community and awaken them from their dreams. The current international situation has gradually fallen into a state of injustice. This is not because the international community is truly without justice, but because it fears the strong and seeks temporary peace, sacrificing treaties in order to protect itself. Is this the way to seek wholeness? It is to destroy oneself by destroying others. Tracing the history of the world and examining its records, no country has not progressed from tribal warfare to the realm of the rule of law. The reason for creating the rule of law is to use its power to stop the cycle of killing and prevent the people of the same country from being sacrificed again. The intention of former US President Wilson in initiating the League of Nations, the establishment of the League, and the covenant jointly observed by its members, was also to eliminate the endless cycle of tribal warfare between nations and lead the world into the realm of the rule of law, so that the people of the world could enjoy peace and no longer be sacrificed in the killing between two countries. His plan was extremely benevolent and his vision was extremely compassionate. Now, this foundation of benevolence and compassion has been attacked by violence, and the member states that have the responsibility to protect the foundation of benevolence and compassion are actually threatened by violence and do not rise up to seek legitimate resistance, but sit idly by and watch the expansion of the scope of killing in order to seek unattainable security. This is truly the utmost folly in the world and the misfortune of mankind. Today, the economic panic in the world and the phenomenon of unemployment in various countries are known to everyone as the result of the losses and casualties of the European War. The lessons of the past are clear, yet they still do not awaken themselves and say that they are not in a dream. This is what the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and over a hundred other public groups hope that the General's trip will awaken the international community from its dreams. If the international community cannot be awakened from its dreams, then our entire nation, both military and civilians, will have to gather economic strength and prepare the spirit of sacrifice to await the General's return, so that the national strength that is sufficient to resist the enemy today can use the authority of the air to impose legitimate sanctions on the violence that undermines the treaties, thereby restoring our national territory, protecting our nation, and adding to the historical record of the world's protection of the law. Therefore, the General's trip is not only for the nation but also for the peace of the world. The General is about to depart, and he will surely not fail to live up to the expectations of the entire nation, both military and civilians. Respectfully presented."</p>
<p>Mr. Weng's Speech: "Chairperson, fellow compatriots, I am truly unworthy of today's farewell from everyone. This time, I am going abroad on behalf of the 19th Route Army and the Aviation Association to study the aviation industries of various countries and to thank the overseas Chinese in Nanyang. I have already resigned from my military post, so I am no longer a national official but only a Chinese soldier. I have resigned from my military post this time to promote the aviation industry with all my strength. All of our people also deeply understand that China cannot be saved without aviation. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings also include the instruction to save the nation through aviation. After the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the people of the country should feel the necessity of promoting aviation even more. I believe that everyone has this feeling and holds this hope. Aviation has its important significance in national defense. When the Japanese army invaded Shanghai this spring, in addition to the army, there were also more than ten warships. When they besieged the Wusong forts, although the artillery fire was fierce, our army fought calmly and ultimately did not lose an inch of our land. Our greatest loss was the lack of air defense equipment. The warships used by the violent Japanese to invade us cost over 30 million yuan each to build and took more than ten years to complete, and their effectiveness was only for destruction. Other countries need a large naval force to protect their overseas territories and to demonstrate their power to their colonies. This is the weapon needed by imperialists. Our country does not have a fully equipped shipyard and lacks skilled technicians, so promoting aviation to strengthen national defense is necessary. I hope that all of my compatriots will enthusiastically promote it. I take this opportunity to wish everyone good health and thank you for your kindness."</p>
<p>Representative Speeches: After Mr. Weng finished his speech, Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Lin Kanghou gave speeches in succession. Mr. Yu briefly said, "Today, various circles are bidding farewell to General Weng. I believe that everyone is deeply aware of General Weng's deeds and there is no need to elaborate. General Weng raised the dignity of the Chinese people in the Wusong campaign. In the past, various countries had contempt for our army, but General Weng was able to hold out for more than thirty days under the combined attacks of Japanese warships and airplanes. The people of various countries should change their attitude and not despise our army. In addition to studying the army, General Weng is also interested in aviation. He has been in a plane crash three times and has not been injured. This is heaven helping our General Weng. General Weng has resigned from his post this time to go abroad to study aviation and to inspect the air forces of various countries. After returning to China, he will establish an aircraft factory and organize civil aviation."</p>

<p>"His return is expected to be after August, at which time we will hold another meeting to welcome him," Mr. Yu said. Mr. Lin Kanghou briefly said, "During the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai, I heard of General Weng's name and admired him privately. A few days ago, I met General Weng at a banquet and had a brief conversation, and it was as if we were old friends. I admired him so much on a normal basis that it felt like we were old friends at our first meeting. General Weng has always advocated that the Chinese people cooperate and help each other to unite against the enemy, and he is also known for his integrity, adherence to the law, and responsibility. If our soldiers could all be like General Weng, then the neighboring countries' prying would not be so fearful."</p>
<p>Presentation of Commemorative Badge: After the speeches, the chairperson Wang Xiaolai, on behalf of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other groups, presented a commemorative badge. The badge was a silver wreath with gold stars and open wings cast on it, which was very beautiful. Amidst the applause of the entire venue, Mr. Wang personally pinned it on General Weng's left lapel. After the presentation of the badge, General Weng thanked everyone and briefly said, "I am very grateful for the commemorative badge presented by various groups. In the future, if I encounter difficulties abroad, seeing this commemorative badge will be like seeing everyone, and I will be even more courageous to deal with everything."</p>
<p>Telegram to Overseas Chinese: Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and three other groups sent a telegram to the Philippine Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, requesting that they welcome General Weng Zhaoyuan upon his arrival. The telegram read, "To the esteemed Philippine Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Weng Zhaoyuan has been ordered to go to various ports overseas to thank the overseas Chinese. He will depart on the President Madison of the Dai Lai Steamship Line and head to the Philippines. Please welcome him upon his arrival. Sincerely, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Guangzhao Public Association, and the Chaozhou Shanghai Association."</p>
<p>Boarding the Ship Last Night: After the meeting adjourned yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Local Association hosted a banquet in the evening to welcome Mr. Weng Zhaoyuan, who was scheduled to board the President Madison at 9:00 PM. The ship will set sail this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e143">France Has Yet to Fulfill the Sino-French Treaty Signed Two Years Ago <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Old Treaty Abolished, New Treaty Not Implemented: Overseas Chinese Like Nationals Without a Treaty</p>
<p>Hundreds of Thousands of Overseas Chinese in Danger of Economic Instability</p>
<p>丨Saigon Chamber of Commerce Sends Representatives Back to the Country to Petition丨</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that since the establishment of the National Government, in view of the unequal treaties between China and the world, it began in the 17th year of the Republic to respectively notify the envoys of various countries stationed in China to negotiate and sign equal treaties in order to facilitate the development of commerce between the two countries and to strengthen diplomatic relations.  So far, treaties have been signed with more than a dozen countries.  Unexpectedly, the new treaty signed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of our country and the French Plenipotentiary Minister to China on May 16, 19th year of the Republic, was promulgated by our country long ago, but the French government has not yet ratified it, so that hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in French-controlled territories are in a position of being nationals without a treaty everywhere.  Commerce is almost stagnant, and the economy is in danger of being without a firm foothold.  The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Saigon, Vietnam, resolved in a general meeting to send its legal counsel, Huang An, and its former secretary-general, Xu Yixian, back to the country to petition the central ministries and departments and negotiate with the French government to ratify and implement the new treaty as soon as possible, and to ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to implement it separately in accordance with the spirit of the new treaty, in order to save the crisis of the overseas Chinese.  The following is a record of the talks between Huang and Xu and the official letter of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Saigon, Vietnam:</p>
<p>Letter from the Saigon Chamber of Commerce to Lin Kanghou: Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, yesterday received Huang An and Xu Yixian, who returned from Vietnam. A letter from the Saigon Chamber of Commerce is enclosed. The original letter reads: "Dear Sirs, overseas Chinese merchants have been doing business in Vietnam for a long time, and there has always been a commercial treaty to protect them. Since the resident government announced and implemented the new customs tariff in the 18th year of the Republic, at the same time, all Sino-French new commercial treaties regarding Vietnam have not been implemented. During the past period when the old treaty was abolished and the new treaty was not implemented, the overseas Chinese merchants in Vietnam were in the position of people of a country without a treaty. According to international precedents, imported goods from countries without treaties are taxed according to ordinary tariffs.  When the old Vietnamese treaty was still in effect, our goods received special tariff preferences. In recent years, they have been treated with ordinary tariffs, and the tax has increased by ten to several tens of percent. Overseas Chinese merchants bear heavy taxes, and business is extremely difficult. Moreover, Vietnam is shrouded in economic depression, and the commercial arena is becoming increasingly sluggish. Overseas Chinese have failed and lack the means to maintain themselves. In addition, in August of this year, the Vietnamese-Japanese commercial treaty was announced and implemented. According to this treaty, Japanese goods, such as tea, silk, porcelain, and paper, are subject to the most-favored-nation tariff treatment. Other goods are also reduced by 10% to 60% according to ordinary tariffs. On the other hand, our goods are taxed according to ordinary tariffs. As a result, the cost of our goods and Japanese goods is very different, and it is even more difficult to sell our goods. Chinese merchants are in a desperate situation. If this continues, Chinese will not be able to gain a foothold in Vietnam. In view of this, our chamber of commerce decided at this month's regular meeting to send Mr. Huang An, the consultant, to Beijing to submit a document to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, urging the implementation of the Vietnamese commercial treaty, and to meet with the authorities in the name of representatives to explain in detail the various sufferings of the overseas Chinese, etc., as recorded in the case.  Naturally, the case will be executed as it stands, and Mr. Huang An will be sent back to the country in mid-month to petition.  I am afraid that it will be difficult to clap with one hand, and I have to seek help from others.  I have always admired your association for its position as a joint organization of merchant institutions, and for taking the interests of merchants as its primary duty. Although overseas Chinese merchants are far away from the motherland, they are closely related to the motherland's commerce and all economic phenomena.  Accordingly, I have recorded the plight of overseas Chinese merchants and the whole story of sending personnel to request the implementation of the Vietnamese commercial treaty and sent it to your association. I sincerely ask you to petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the Chinese and French governments to implement the Vietnamese commercial treaty signed in May of the 19th year of the Republic, and to ask your association to provide other appropriate assistance, so that overseas Chinese merchants can slightly reduce the pain of heavy tariffs. As for all the methods and processes of carrying out assistance, I hope to see a reply.  I am extremely eager to do so.  Sincerely yours,</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Assists in the Process: The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce believes that this case is related to the livelihoods of overseas Chinese and has a great impact on the export of domestic goods. Yesterday morning, Chairman Lin specially sent Secretary Gu Huaibing and Clerk Ge Tianhao to visit the two representatives, Huang and Xu, at their residence to discuss the methods of implementation. They returned to the association after about an hour. It is reported that Huang and Xu are scheduled to go to Beijing this week to petition the central government. In addition to preparing a petition, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce will also provide strong assistance.</p>
<p>Two Representatives Talk About the Content of the Treaty: A reporter from the Guowen News Agency, introduced by Chairman Lin of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, visited the two representatives, Huang and Xu, at their residence to talk about the content of the Sino-French treaty and the current situation of the overseas Chinese. The main points are excerpted as follows: The two representatives said: (1) The treaty signed by our Minister of Foreign Affairs and the French Plenipotentiary Minister to China on May 16 of the 19th year of the Republic stated in the first article that all previous old treaties between China and France, such as the Tianjin Land Trade Treaty of the 12th year of Guangxu, the Beijing Commercial Special Treaty of the 13th year of Guangxu, and the Commercial Supplementary Articles of the 21st year of Guangxu, were all abolished. (2) Article 3 of the new treaty stipulates that the Chinese government may station consuls in Hanoi, Haiphong, and Saigon in Vietnam, and the French government may continue to station consuls in the locations listed in the previous treaty (Guangxi's 　Zhou, Yunnan's Simao, Hekou, Mengzi). (3) Article 5 of the same treaty and its annex (2) A and B have signed the following: Chinese people in Vietnam and French people in the above-mentioned locations shall have the right to reside, travel, and engage in industry and commerce. The treatment given to these people to exercise these rights in accordance with the current regulations and laws of Vietnam or China shall not be inferior to the treatment enjoyed by the people of any other country. The donations and other taxes paid by Chinese people in Vietnam and French people in the ten Chinese locations shall not be different from or higher than those paid by the people of the most-favored-nation country. (4) Annex to the same treaty, (4) Item A, regarding Article 5 of the Sino-French Special Treaty signed today, I, the ambassador, would like to reiterate to your minister that the government of this country does not consider the provisions contained in this treaty as preventing it from collecting from the Chinese people, the relevant taxes related to the exercise of special rights historically enjoyed in Vietnam, etc. According to the above articles, we can first make the following simple conclusions: (A) From the date of abolition of all old treaties to the end of October of this year, a total of two years and five months, during this period, the old treaty has become ineffective, and the new treaty has not been implemented. Hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Vietnam have become people of a country without a treaty. (B) Since the new treaty has not been implemented, the consuls are obviously absent, so for the past two or three years, all negotiations have been at a standstill. Even the consular visa manifest regulations promulgated by our government recently cannot be implemented. The overseas Chinese in Vietnam do not know what to do. Some of them ask the chamber of commerce for proof, while others ask the guild hall to help issue visas. The foreign merchants there are even more confused. There is no legitimate organization to give them a proper explanation. Moreover, they have witnessed that the visa issuing organization lacks the professional qualifications for visa issuance and allows cargo merchants to choose freely, so they laugh and ridicule it as child's play. (C) Since the old treaty has become ineffective, all rights in the old treaty have been cancelled. Although the new treaty has not been implemented, all obligations in the new treaty must be borne. For example, (A) Regarding tariffs, in the era of the old treaty (that is, three years ago), all goods shipped from our country to Vietnam either paid special taxes (that is, special light taxes, which only applied to Chinese people, because the goods came from China, and most of them were purchased by overseas Chinese, which did not conflict with the development of French and Vietnamese industry and commerce, and had special characteristics, hence the name special tax) or paid reciprocal taxes, but ordinary tariffs. Since the old treaty was declared invalid, all Chinese goods have not only been unable to enjoy the first type of special light tax, but also the second type of ordinary reciprocal tax has also been completely cancelled. All goods are subject to the third type of the highest tariff rate for countries without treaties. The difference between the old tax and the new tax is from two or three times to eight or nine times or dozens of times. Therefore, the promotion of domestic goods has gradually come to an end from a standstill. (B) Regarding miscellaneous taxes</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>In addition to paying business tax, land tax, and residence tax, overseas Chinese in Vietnam must also pay surcharges. This type of surcharge is a necessary tax for Chinese people and is not generally applied to overseas Chinese from other countries in Vietnam. The surcharge rate is directly proportional to business, land, and other taxes, and is about twice as high. For example, if the business tax or land tax is 1,000 yuan, an additional 1,200 yuan must be paid, for a total of 2,200 yuan. According to the laws of the resident government, all regular taxes or surcharges should be paid before April of each year. If they are not paid by the deadline, the government will seal the business and auction it. If the residence tax is owed, they will be expelled from the country. (C) According to Article 5 of the new treaty, the rights and treatment of Chinese legal persons in China or overseas Chinese in Vietnam shall not be inferior to the treatment enjoyed by the people of any other country, and the donations or other taxes they pay shall not be different from or higher than those paid by the people of the most-favored-nation country. This kind of clear text is only for consolation on paper and is greatly contrary to the facts. There is no need to prove it. Even taking a step back, the French Plenipotentiary Minister to China informed our Minister of Foreign Affairs on the date of signing the new treaty (Annex 3A) that the government of this country (France) does not consider the provisions contained in that article as preventing it from collecting from the Chinese people the relevant taxes related to the exercise of special rights historically enjoyed in Vietnam, etc. It means that overseas Chinese in Vietnam have historically enjoyed special rights and should continue to pay the special taxes that have been paid historically. May I ask what the other party means by special rights? Is it the special light tax on the population of Chinese goods, or do Chinese people have the right to own property, bid, and navigate inland rivers? Let me give a more detailed explanation. (1) The special light tax enjoyed by Chinese goods imported in the past has now become a special heavy tax. (2) Not only do Chinese people have the right to own property, but also any national in Saigon (that is, the general name of Saigon, Chidi, and the suburbs, which the French call the colony) has the right to own property. If it is said that in the area of Tokyo and Phnom Penh (which the French call the protectorate, Chinese people also have the right to own property, then only overseas Chinese in Tokyo and Phnom Penh pay surcharges. Why do overseas Chinese in Saigon suffer for no reason? (3) Bidding (referring to contracting public projects, etc.) and inland river navigation, because the Annamese people are not accustomed to this kind of business, and the French are unwilling to do it. In fact, the Chinese people's contribution to the large and small buildings in Vietnam and the communication of inland river transportation is so important to the development of local industry and commerce. We are unwilling to take credit for ourselves, but why do the French reluctantly regard it as a special right of overseas Chinese? If so, it is not difficult for the operators among the overseas Chinese to unload the burden and let the Annamese people do it themselves or the French do it for them. In recent years, business has been bleak, and the market has been depressed. Contracting and shipping have been losing money and have been in a slump. All kinds of rights that the other party said were specially enjoyed by overseas Chinese have been completely eliminated due to changes in local laws or changes in the natural environment, and the heavy taxes added because of the rights still exist. Overseas Chinese lack treaty protection and lack the clever strategy of turning things into gold, then the crisis in the future will be unbearable to speak of. Overseas Chinese will never sit idly by and wait for death. Therefore, the Saigon General Chamber of Commerce, through a general meeting, specially sent my brothers and others back to the country to appeal to the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, and on behalf of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Vietnam, made the following requests: (1) Please ask the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to urge the French government to fulfill the treaty signed by the French Plenipotentiary Minister to China in Nanjing on May 16, 1930, as soon as possible. (2) Please ask our government to implement the important points in the treaty: (A) Send consuls to protect them and foster good relations. (B) Negotiate to cancel the harsh taxes that have lost their basis in order to relieve the suffering of the overseas Chinese. The above few articles are only the most obvious ones. Other issues, such as the need to improve the treatment of overseas Chinese in the Saigon Immigration Bureau, the trouble of import and export procedures, the entanglement of overseas Chinese in lawsuits in the courts, and other issues, are all about having a consul first, and then negotiating separately. Overseas Chinese are hoping for the implementation of the new treaty, like hoping for clouds and rain in a long drought. If the new treaty is not implemented for a long time, the life of the overseas Chinese will be withered and dried up, and will disappear from dryness. If the new treaty is not implemented, not only will there be no consuls to negotiate for the overseas Chinese, but when will the population tariff, which is as heavy as carrying a mountain, be reduced? It should be noted that hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese buy domestic goods worth more than tens of millions of yuan a year and are the only customers for selling domestic goods. Even if the overseas Chinese themselves are not worth regretting, shouldn't our country find a way out for the budding industry? In May of this year, the French government and Japan newly concluded the Vietnam Commercial Treaty, which was announced and implemented in August. Tea, porcelain, silk fabrics, paper, etc. from Japan to Vietnam are given the most-favored-nation tariff treatment, and some Japanese goods are specially reduced in tax by 10% to 60%. If this continues, overseas Chinese will not only be unable to be direct customers of domestic goods, but will also inevitably become consumers of enemy goods indirectly. How can the pain be expressed? Although overseas Chinese are far away in foreign lands and live under the eaves of others, they never forget their concern for the motherland. When they get good news from the country, they tell each other and forget to sleep and eat. On the contrary, they are worried and all try their best to remedy the situation together. The donations to natural disasters and man-made disasters in various provinces of our country, the reward for past charitable causes, and the diligence in purchasing various public bonds are all about saving money and food and jointly relieving the country's difficulties. Overseas Chinese love their country and are not behind others, so the government's policy of protecting them should especially inherit the late Premier's legacy of supporting overseas Chinese and provide relief as soon as possible, so as to avoid hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Vietnam from falling into an unmanageable situation. Then our country's diplomacy is fortunate, and the survival of the future of the overseas Chinese is fortunate, etc.</p>

<p>Only Zhou Han Has Not Yet Received It</p>
<p>Wang Delin's Representative Expresses Gratitude: Liang Detang, the Plenipotentiary Representative of Wang Delin, Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army, replied to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association yesterday, saying: "Dear Sirs, Jiang Yunyan Shu, I am honored to receive your letter, and I am deeply grateful for your concern for our army's extremely difficult winter garrison. I have received the generous assistance of 5,000 yuan, which has been remitted in full. I will immediately find a way to remit it and send a capable person to the front line to report to Commander Wang, asking him to announce it to the three armies to praise your kindness, so as to encourage the public to strive for exemption and strengthen their determination to kill the enemy and recover the land. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of the 60,000 armed comrades, and I hope for continued support. Recently, the news has gradually become more accurate, and the military affairs are going more smoothly than before. I will report the details after a detailed investigation. I would like to express my gratitude here and wish you good health.</p>
<p>Ding Li's Representative Expresses Gratitude: Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Wang Ziyao, the representative of Ding Chao and Li Du, which said: "Dear Sirs, the public letter from your association on October 19 stated that 20,000 yuan was allocated for Jilin's relief expenses, of which 7,000 yuan was allocated to General Zhu to be responsible for manufacturing winter clothes for Feng's troops. The remaining 13,000 yuan was remitted to your office by the Bank of China in Shanghai on October 18, and 5,000 yuan of the remitted funds was designated for Commander Wang Delin to receive. In addition to sending separate letters, I hereby inform you to check, etc. After that, on the 25th of this month, we received a notice from the Bank of China, and we received all 13,000 yuan as planned. We immediately allocated 5,000 yuan to Commander Wang Delin, and Liang Detang, the representative, signed the receipt and took it away. The remaining 8,000 yuan was directly remitted to the two commanders, Li and Ding, and it has been telegraphed to them for approval. We hope that you will appreciate it. I now attach a copy of the telegram from the two commanders, Li and Ding, in Jilin, which states the details, etc. In view of the severe cold outside the customs, we have already sent a telegram. Our exhausted troops are fighting against the elite enemy. Your public love for the country is long. We still hope for continuous assistance, so that our army will not be trapped by freezing and hunger. Then the recovery of the rivers and mountains is also the power of you, etc.</p>
<p>Inquiry About the Remittance Situation: The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association sent a letter to Director Pan of the National Salvation Army's Shanghai Communications Office yesterday, saying: "Dear Sirs, according to a telegram from Zhou Hanjian, 'President Zhu, I am deeply grateful. Our army is attacking the enemy day and night, and we are in short supply of food, bullets, and cotton clothes. The funds we received before have not yet arrived, and we are extremely anxious. Please remit them directly to facilitate the military affairs. I am deeply grateful. Please reply by telegram, Zhou Hanjian (issued from Beipiao),' etc. According to this, the funds for the relief of Zhou Hanjian's troops have long been allocated to your office for responsible transfer. Now that we have received a telegram urging them, we hereby send a letter to ask you to check and handle it, and we hope to receive a reply." This letter is addressed to Director Pan Yunshao of the Northeast National Salvation Army's Shanghai Communications Office.</p>

<p>Adopting the Principle of Resolving the Shandong Situation</p>
<p>The Anti-Civil War Alliance abolished and reorganized. Because the Shandong situation has not been resolved for a long time, the standing committee members stationed in Shanghai specially decided through a conversation meeting to send a telegram to the military commission with the principle of resolution, advocating that the highest military organ of the national army's defense area has the right to designate it, but the stationed army should not interfere in civil administration, and separately sent telegrams to the National Government Military Commission. Now we have received a reply telegram from the Military Commission, which says, "The General Association of the Anti-Civil War Alliance in Shanghai, I am honored to receive your telegram, which states that the dispute in Shandong has been delayed for nearly a month and has not been resolved. Please quickly determine a method and establish prestige, and present the principles of resolution, etc. After reviewing it, I greatly admire your insight. The case of the conflict between the Han and Liu armies has been repeatedly ordered to stop both sides and to stop military actions in a real manner, and to wait for the central government to handle it. Later, we sent personnel to Shandong to inspect the actual situation of the two armies and are currently planning a solution. I hereby reply and hope that you will check it. Military Commission Yan, Halberd Seal.</p>
<h3 id="e147">The National Federation of All Circles for National Salvation Closed Yesterday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of All Circles for National Salvation convened an inaugural meeting on the 30th. It was originally planned to close the meeting the day before yesterday (31st), but because the conference work was numerous and needed to be discussed urgently, the session was extended until yesterday morning (1st) before it was closed.</p>
<p>Closing Ceremony: At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the representatives Xie Naishi, Long Xiangsan, Zhang Zhiyuan, Cai Chongli, Liu Chuanzhong, Dong Mosheng, Chen Zhenquan, etc. arrived one after another and began the closing ceremony. The procedure was: (1) Music, (2) Paying the highest respect to the Party and the National Flag and the portrait of the Premier, (3) Silent tribute to the compatriots who died in the Northeast, (4) The Chairman respectfully reads the Premier's will, (5) Passing the conference declaration, (6) The Presidium reads the congratulatory telegrams from various places (13 items), (7) Report by the Volunteer Army Representative, (8) Closing address, (9) Music and closing, and shouting slogans.</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Report: After the conference declaration was passed, the Presidium read 18 congratulatory telegrams from all parties (omitted). After reading, Yang Yijie, the representative of Geng Jizhou, the commander of the 4th Route of the Volunteer Army in western Liaoning, was invited to the conference to report on the anti-Japanese situation of the Volunteer Army, saying, "Representatives, today I am very honored to be invited by the conference to meet you here. The enthusiasm of all comrades for resisting Japan and saving the country is even more admirable to me. I have already given a brief report on the battle situation of the Volunteer Army in western Liaoning at the preparatory meeting of your association. Today, I might as well explain it to you in detail again. There are now a lot of volunteer armies in the Northeast. Even the 4th Route Army alone has more than 30,000 people. Most of these people are local people. Under the brutal oppression and massacre of Japanese imperialism, no one is not indignant and joins the volunteer army to fight to the death with the Japanese army. Therefore, although Japanese imperialism has sharp guns and cannons, it is finally no match for the determined volunteer army. Since the fall of Jinzhou, the news between the volunteer army outside the customs and inside the customs has unfortunately been cut off, so the various places inside the customs cannot know the detailed news of the volunteer army. The volunteer army outside the customs, which is really fighting hard in a bloody battle, not only does not receive substantial assistance from the government, but also does not receive sufficient relief from the compatriots. The salary and weapons are all cut off. They have to fight desperately in the cold and artillery fire on an empty stomach and wearing single clothes. This is really the most painful thing. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the representatives attending the meeting today can unite together and strive for the country and the nation to be the backing of our volunteer army. Then we will be willing to die of hunger and in battle. Finally, I have one more thing to report to you, that is, what the volunteer army needs now is food and military equipment, not money. Fellow compatriots from all walks of life, rather than taking out money to donate to the volunteer army, I am afraid that it will be embezzled by people, it is better to really take out money to buy airplanes, guns, cannons, food and supplies and give them directly to the volunteer army.</p>
<p>Closing Address: After the volunteer army representative finished his report, Zhang Junguang of the Presidium gave a closing address, saying, "Representatives, our conference was originally scheduled to close in two days, but because there was so much work, it was extended to today before it closed. After two and a half days of enthusiastic discussion, we have finally achieved a very satisfactory result. At this conference, all the representatives were able to fully express their opinions with their own unique insights and established so many resolutions. If these many resolutions can be implemented in a real and thorough manner, then we believe that China's anti-Japanese movement will definitely have new development. Therefore, I hope that after the closing of the meeting, all the representatives will work together to implement the resolutions of the conference, so that these many resolutions will not become empty talk on paper and complete our great mission and thoroughly eliminate the shackles of imperialism. At the closing of this meeting, I have no better ideas to offer to the representatives, only my sincere hope, celebrating the bright and victorious future."</p>
<h3 id="e148">Yesterday Morning, New Shanghai Security Bureau Chief Yang Hu Takes Office <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The position of Shanghai Security Bureau Chief, originally concurrently held by Mayor Wu, has now been filled by Yang Hu, recommended by Wu to the Military Affairs Commission for succession. Yang arrived at the Bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday to assume his duties. Over a hundred people including Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Hongjun, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, Wen Hongen, Chen Yiting, Yin Dangeng, Yao Mulian, and Jin Liren, arrived one after another to offer congratulations.</p>
<p>Convocation and Admonition: After Yang Hu arrived, he immediately convened the staff and officers for admonition. First, Mayor Wu delivered an introductory speech. After the speech, Yang delivered a sincere admonition, roughly saying: "Fellow colleagues, I have been entrusted by the Mayor and have come here today to take office. Today is the first day I meet with you all. The Bureau has been established for only two or three months, and I have heard excellent feedback from all sectors. This is of course due to the leadership of Mayor Wu and the result of your collective efforts. My relationship with Mayor Wu is that, in public matters, we have worked together for a long time. In private, Mayor Wu and I have been friends in adversity for many years. Now we are serving together in the same place, under the guidance of the Mayor in the Security Bureau. Hereafter, I will handle matters in accordance with the methods originally established by Mayor Wu. I hope that you will continue to work hard for the Bureau as before. This is what I want to strive for together with you. We must all be loyal and responsible to our duties at the Bureau. Under the leadership of the Mayor, we must all work with vigor, and rewards and punishments must be clear, and merits and demerits must be clearly distinguished. I will be impartial and selfless in my duties toward all colleagues, without any perfunctoriness. All promotions, demotions, rewards, and punishments will be based entirely on performance evaluations. I hope you will all understand and pay attention to this. I will not say much today. In the future, we will often work together to shoulder the responsibilities of the Security Bureau."</p>
<p>Announcing Staff: After Yang Hu took office, he did not change any of the original staff. It is said that he did not want to easily transfer anyone and fall into the bad habits of officialdom, only announcing the appointments of Wu Huan as Director of the Office, Zou Yun as Chief of the Second Section, and Chen Qian as Secretary, among a few others.</p>
<p>Security Bureau Chief Yang Xiaotian</p>
<p>Yang Hu's Brief Biography: Yang's given name is Hu, courtesy name Xiaotian, from Ningguo County, Anhui Province. He has followed the Premier in the revolution for many years, serving as Military Counselor to the Grand Presidential Office, Military Counselor to the Grand Marshal's Office, Director of the Navy Department of the General Headquarters, and Commander of the First Division of the Northern Expeditionary Army. After 1926, he served as Director of the Special Affairs Department of the General Headquarters, Political Affairs Committee Member of the Anhui Provincial Government, Shanghai Garrison Commander, and Military Counselor to the National Government. At the Fourth National Congress, he was elected as a Central Supervisory Committee Member, concurrently holding his current position.</p>

<p>Mr. Li Shizhi, a local literary figure, founded the Zuihua National Language Night School inside the Zhiming School in Yaojia'an Lane, west of Hongqiao, inside the West Gate. For the past four years, it has been dedicated to providing continuing education in national studies for employed individuals, accepting both male and female students. Introduced by his disciples Yan Jian and Zhang Gongquan through newspaper advertisements, the school currently has nearly one hundred students. Recently, Mr. Li, recognizing the heroic resistance of the Northeast Volunteer Army against the Japanese, initiated a fundraising campaign. In one day, he raised 104.5 yuan in silver dollars from both the advanced and general classes, which were immediately remitted to the front lines. The night school's enthusiastic charitable act is truly a model for schools.</p>

<p>Water Patrol in Disguise Captures Six</p>
<p>Whereabouts of Leader Wu Yusheng Unknown</p>
<p>The Xin Yi Public Insurance Company, and the Yongfu, Yutai, Shentai, and other flower clothing firms, jointly submitted a report to the Customs Water Patrol Police Station a few days ago, stating that water bandits frequently operate in the Suzhou Creek flower clothing firm area, specifically robbing flower clothing from ships. Each robbery results in losses of no less than several hundred yuan. With the new flowers entering the market, this is truly unbearable. They requested an investigation and capture, etc. The chief then ordered patrol officers to disguise themselves as boatmen the other night. When they reached the front of the Shenxin No. 1 Factory, a group of water bandits indeed drove a rowboat and attempted to rob the flower clothing. They were subsequently apprehended. Six individuals, Fang Shaowen, Zhang Yunxiang, Li Shengquan, Liu Kailin, Chang Qihua, and Shi Yu Yu, along with a rowboat, were taken to the police station. During interrogation, the suspects confessed that their leader was Wu Desheng, and their accomplices Cao Huisu, Lao Wu, Chen Little Monk, Little Sanzi, and Little Ma, etc., operated small goods stores in Caojiadu, etc., where they received stolen flowers. They bought them for twenty yuan a bundle and sold them for thirty-three yuan. If boatmen refused to sell, they would resort to robbery, etc. The suspects were deemed a major scourge of the Huangpu River. Therefore, they were prosecuted for robbery and handed over to the local court for investigation. They were transferred to the court yesterday for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Li Maozhi Takes Office as Director of the Fisheries Bureau of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Fan Zhilong, Director of the Marine Fisheries Administration of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region of the Ministry of Industry, previously requested to resign due to personal matters, and his resignation has been approved. Li Maozhi has been appointed as his successor. Mr. Li arrived at the Bureau yesterday to assume his duties. A swearing-in ceremony will be held at a later date. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Li at the Bureau yesterday to inquire about the future direction of the Bureau's work. According to Mr. Li, he has been ordered to take charge of the Bureau's affairs, and all original staff members will remain in their positions to ensure familiarity with the work. However, Section Chief Li Zuchao has been ordered to transfer to the Ministry to serve, and Luo Xingbo has been appointed as his successor. As for the future direction of the Bureau's work, he will strive to improve and promote the development and safety of the fisheries in the region, and vigorously advocate for expanding the protection of fishermen. Recent plans include: (1) Establishing a fisheries bank with a projected capital of over one million yuan, half of which will be allocated by the Ministry and half by the banking sector and fishery merchants. Once established, fishermen will undoubtedly benefit greatly economically. (2) Encouraging merchants to establish more fishing boat companies, so that fishermen's livelihoods can be improved as the fishing industry develops. (3) Establishing a fish market. It is expected that the aforementioned three plans can be achieved one by one in the shortest possible time. Mr. Li's resume is listed below: Li Maozhi, a native of Guangdong, served as Secretary of the Presidential Office in Nanjing in 1912, as a Senator in 1913, as Salt Transport Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi in 1918, as Co-Director of the Guangdong Provincial Fundraising Bureau in 1920, and as Counselor to the National Government in 1931.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Business Community Dissatisfied with Meierhe's Remarks on the Issue of Reforming Customs Administration <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the search of stores, Meierhe, the Inspector General of Customs, made a statement the other day to defend himself, which was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Zheng Chengqing, the representative of the petitioners, yesterday to ask for his opinion on Mr. Meierhe's remarks. Mr. Zheng replied as follows: Inspector General Meierhe made a statement in the local newspapers on the first of this month regarding the search of stores by the Jianghai Customs, the main points of which are: (1) It is not just Chinese stores that are being searched, and some foreign merchants have also been searched in the past. (2) Most of the goods seized by the Customs are directly imported from overseas and not purchased from foreign merchants, and there are often unscrupulous merchants colluding with foreign merchants to smuggle goods into China. These two points should be presented by the injured party when filing a petition, with the Customs providing concrete evidence to the competent authorities. Currently, these are just vague arguments, and we do not need to refute them. However, the main point of this case is whether the Customs' right to search can extend from the seaport to stores. This is the primary question. If this point is clarified, the rest is just rhetoric. According to Inspector General Meierhe, "The method of searching Chinese stores is also adopted by countries in the East and West, and the Jianghai Customs is not the first to create this precedent." These few words are enough to show that the Customs' current methods do not include the right to enter stores to search for Shanghai taxes. Therefore, he can only justify it by saying that it is also adopted by countries in the East and West. Comparing Inspector General Meierhe's statement with the Customs Administration's response to the petitioning representatives, it can be proved that the Customs' right to search is indeed limited to the seaport and its affiliated customs offices. We can calmly and objectively judge that the Customs handles tax collection as an agency for enforcing laws, not an agency for creating laws. Since the establishment of the Customs, the Inspector General has only had the right to propose suggestions for any matters that should be established or reformed. It must be approved and promulgated by the Prime Minister's Office or the Customs Administration's Tax Office or the Ministry of Finance before it can become a Customs regulation that applies throughout the country. When the government has not approved it, the precedents of countries in the East and West can only be the personal opinion of the Inspector General, submitted to the government for reference. Since the Customs has never had such a regulation for searching stores, if, as the Inspector General claims, it is necessary to do so, then this can be said to be "a new kind of power" that should be granted to the Customs by the central government before it can be implemented. The Customs cannot create laws or increase its own power. Therefore, according to the above argument, the Customs' extension of the right to suppress smuggling from the Customs to stores is at least responsible for (1) violating the law and (2) exceeding its authority. According to administrative regulations, this is enough to constitute grounds for disciplinary action. We hope that those who cherish the law will study this together.</p>

<p>To be held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 5th of this month</p>
<p>One hundred and four Shanghai gentlemen jointly sent a letter to the leaders of various industries and political and military officials in the city, saying: "Respected Sirs, we have repeatedly received telegrams from Chairman Chiang, stating that the recovered bandit areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei have been in decline for a long time and are suffering from severe disasters. He hopes that a fact-finding delegation will be organized as soon as possible to visit the disaster areas to design detailed plans and actively raise relief funds to restore rural production, etc. It is imperative to actively raise relief funds and organize a delegation of representatives from all sectors of Shanghai to inspect the disaster areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. We will convene a meeting of leaders from all sectors at a fixed time to discuss and plan together. We have scheduled a meeting for 6:00 PM on Saturday, November 5th, at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Hall, with a simple vegetarian meal, to discuss all matters related to the implementation. This matter concerns the relief of disaster victims, and we hope that you will take the time to attend and join us in this charitable endeavor. We eagerly await your presence."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Wu Tiecheng, Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, and others from the Shanghai Provisional Charity Relief Association for the Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, attached a letter to the leaders of various sectors, saying: "We further report that the recovered areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei have suffered for a long time, with everything destroyed. The severe winter is approaching, and relief is urgently needed. We respectfully request your presence at the scheduled time so that we can discuss and improve our efforts. We eagerly await your presence. With utmost respect, we wish you peace and prosperity."</p>
<h3 id="e154">Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Scheduled to Inspect Imported Alcohol <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Starting December 1st</p>
<p>Alcohol is widely needed for industrial and combustion purposes, but it is harmful to human health when used as a beverage. Therefore, various European and American countries have strict restrictions on the use of alcohol. All alcohol reported for combustion or industrial use must be mixed with toxic substances and clearly labeled in a prominent place on the packaging so that purchasers can see at a glance and dare not use it as a beverage. Our country has never had such regulations on alcohol, which is somewhat lacking in terms of protecting human health. In view of this, the Executive Yuan has promulgated regulations on the prohibition of alcohol, ordering the Ministry of Industry to instruct various commodity inspection bureaus to comply. The Ministry of Industry, based on the aforementioned regulations and the Provisional Regulations on Commodity Inspection, has formulated regulations on the inspection of imported alcohol, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgated by ministerial order. All imported alcohol will be subject to inspection starting December 1st of this year. Areas that already have commodity inspection bureaus will conduct inspections locally. Areas without inspection bureaus will import through nearby areas with inspection bureaus and then conduct inspections. Shanghai already has a commodity inspection bureau and should conduct inspections locally in accordance with the Ministry's regulations. Alcohol imported through Wuhu, Jiujiang, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, and Hangzhou will be imported through Shanghai and inspected by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. After receiving the order, the Bureau made preparations for inspection and decided to start processing on December 1st of this year. After December 1st, alcohol imported into Shanghai must be reported to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau for inspection in accordance with the regulations, and a certificate will be issued before it can be declared for import. Merchants who import alcohol or manufacture alcohol domestically and wish to know the regulations and details of the inspection can visit the Inspection Bureau after the 10th of this month to obtain them.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Anhui Public Groups Hold Joint Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Opposing the Provincial Government's Collection of Rice License Fees</p>
<p>The Anhui Association in Shanghai and the Anhui Student Association in Shanghai, due to the Anhui Provincial Government violating public opinion by establishing a Food Administration Bureau and collecting rice license fees, convened a joint meeting of all Anhui public groups in Shanghai at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Sima Road at 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Yesterday, over one hundred and ten people including Wang Shujiao, Li Cishan, Liu Zhuqing, Pan Ying, Fang Chen, Hu Peiru, Zhu Ziming, Lei Younan, Wang Zhuru, Li Shaochuan, Yu Kongwo, and Yuan Yeyu attended.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Li Cishan was elected as the chairman. After performing the rituals, the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, roughly saying: "This year, Anhui has had a bumper harvest, the first in twenty years. Farmers are generally suffering because the price of grain is too low, making their livelihoods extremely difficult. This situation is equivalent to a famine. Efforts should be made to circulate grain to create livelihoods for farmers. However, the provincial government has failed to observe the hardships of the people and has established a Food Administration Bureau to collect rice license fees, which is a disguised form of likin tax. Even during Chen Tiaoyuan's time, efforts were made to eliminate it. Now that the ruler is a native of Anhui, he is going against the tide. Therefore, we have convened a meeting of various groups to abolish this measure."</p>
<p>Resolutions: After the chairman's report, the proposals were discussed. (1) A proposal to send representatives to various ministries and departments in Beijing to petition. It was resolved to send representatives Hu Peiru, Liu Zhuqing, Zhu Zaixin, and Zhu Ziming to Beijing to petition. (2) A proposal to send representatives to the Hankou Headquarters to petition. It was resolved to pass it. (3) A proposal to send representatives to Anqing, Wuhu, Bengbu, and other places to appeal to all sectors for unified support. It was resolved to send six representatives to Anqing, Wuhu, and Bengbu. (4) A proposal to send a telegram to the provincial party headquarters to file an impeachment. It was resolved to pass it. (5) A proposal to create an iron statue of Chen Tiaoyuan, who caused the disaster in Anhui. It was resolved to hand it over to the two associations for design and implementation. (6) A proposal to send another telegram to the provincial government to quickly abolish the rice license fee. It was resolved to pass it. (7) It was heard that Jiang Wei was in charge of the Anhui Provincial Gazetteer Office, which has consumed huge sums of money over the years with no results. The association should send a letter to the provincial party and political organs to thoroughly investigate the matter. It was resolved to pass it. (8) A proposal to notify Anhui associations in various provinces and cities of the resolutions of the meeting. It was resolved to pass it.</p>

<h3 id="e160">New Standards for Shops Hanging Flags <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Notice from the Nanjing Road Business Association to its Members</p>
<p>Thirteen Feet or Seven Feet Six Inches from the Ground</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement sent a letter to the Nanjing Road Business Association, stating that many of the shop signs and advertising flags hanging in Nanjing Road violated Article 33 of the Police Regulations. They requested the Association to notify all shops to make reforms within two weeks, or they would be prosecuted according to the regulations. The Association felt that it would be difficult to make reforms according to the regulations, so they sent representatives to negotiate with the police department. A new compromise standard was reached. Therefore, yesterday, the Association notified all member shops, saying, "Regarding the notice, we have received a letter from the Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department stating that the flags hanging by shops are too low, violating Article 33 of the Police Regulations. Warnings have been issued, but most shops have not complied. If they do not comply within two weeks, the matter will be brought to court. This Association has been asked to advise them accordingly. We note that hanging flags is important for business, and it is not appropriate to remove them suddenly. However, the police authorities said that low-hanging flags obstruct the passage of police vehicles and fire engines (because these vehicles are taller than any other vehicles), and they also create obstacles for police officers performing their duties. In addition to replying to the police department that we would inform them, we also sent representatives to negotiate with the police department today. The result of the negotiation is that 'flags must be thirteen feet high from the road surface, and signs or awnings must be seven feet six inches (both in English feet) above the sidewalk.' We believe that all member businesses will prioritize public affairs and comply immediately."</p>

<h3 id="e162">Further Arrests in the Assassination of Zhao Xilin Case <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Zhao's Concubine Witnessed the Shooting</p>
<p>Zhao Xilin, from Changzhou, was formerly a detective in the local Public Security Bureau, where he worked hard to arrest local thugs and bandits. After being dismissed, he came to Shanghai to work as an inspector at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road. He had many enemies and was shot at three times. On the evening of June 13th of this year, at around 8:00 PM, he was shot and killed near Wanxingfang on Yangshupu Road. Shen Yuzhou, a Chinese detective from the Yangshupu Police Station, arrested Tang Fuchang, a suspect from Changzhou, and handed him over to the First Special District Court. After the interrogation was completed, he was awaiting sentencing. This has already been reported in this newspaper. The Changzhou natives, Fang Renzhao (also known as Fang Renchuan), Wu Zhiying (also known as Hou Rongchun), along with the suspect Tan Jinfu from Jiangwan, have been arrested and taken to the police station. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Criminal Division Three Police Station, stated yesterday that after investigation, the two defendants, Fang and Wu, were the main culprits in the third shooting of Zhao Xilin at Wanxingfang. Zhao's concubine, Jiang, identified them at the police station as the shooters. The defendant Wu Zhiying admitted that he shot Zhao Xilin at the time of the incident, and that the first shot was fired by Fang Renzhao, and the second shot was fired by him. Fang and Wu had committed several robbery cases in Changzhou, and the local authorities issued warrants for Zhao Xilin to arrest them, resulting in accumulated resentment. However, Fang denied being an accomplice at the police station, and the third defendant, Tan Jinfu, was detained for investigation. Judge Shen Bingrong granted Zhang's request and ordered the defendants to be interrogated separately. Jiang, the concubine of the victim Zhao Xilin, stated that she and her husband were coming from the Changzhou opera theater on Songpan Road and were walking near Wanxingfang when they suddenly heard gunshots from behind. When she turned around, she saw the two defendants, Fang and Wu, shooting nearby, about thirty to forty feet away. There was another person standing there, but she could not see his face clearly. Her husband was shot and fell to the ground. She wanted to chase after them, but her husband stopped her. She recognized the two defendants because they had previously visited the opera theater. Wu Zhiying confessed that his real name was Hou Rongchun, and that he was drinking tea at the Laohuzao on Songpan Road that night when he met Fang Renzhao. Fang asked him to help, and near Wanxingfang, Fang said that Zhao was coming, and he immediately shot. He did not act. The court said that he confessed in the police station that the second shot was fired by him, and there was no need to retract his confession. Wu then admitted that he also shot once, and afterwards, he and Fang fled together and stayed in a small inn near the Great World in the French Concession. The rest of his confession was evasive. He also claimed that he did not know Tan Jinfu and that he did not go there that night. Fang Renzhao confessed that he did not drink tea with Wu Zhiying in the Songpan Road and did not go to shoot Zhao. Tan Jinfu confessed that he knew Fang because they used to work together at the foreign-owned Samsung Cotton Mill, but he did not know Wu Zhiying and had nothing to do with the murder of Zhao Xilin. Judge Shen ordered all of them to be remanded in custody and investigated further.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the case reported by the Fifth District, it was found that on the 19th of this month (October), the police chief Li Xia of the Qujiaqiao Police Station reported that an unidentified male corpse, about 22 or 23 years old, was found behind the Central University on Jiangwan Road, wearing a navy blue serge student uniform and leather shoes, lying on the west side of the railway tracks. Before reporting, the local bailiff was ordered to go to the court for an examination, and telegrams were sent to the Supervision Department and a form was filled out to report to the department for verification. Subsequently, the court sent prosecutor Wu Deying to the scene to examine the corpse, and it was determined that the death was caused by injury. A burial notice No. 278 was filled out, and the Supervision Department sent Inspector Zhong Weiwu to the office to inspect the scene and report the notice to the bureau. It was found that the unidentified male corpse was rumored to have fallen from a train and died. However, the burial notice filled out by the prosecutor did not state the cause of death. In addition to taking photos of the corpse for record and ordering the local bailiff to bury it, it is appropriate to present a written report along with six photos for your examination and forwarding for public notice, so that the relatives of the deceased can come to claim the body. We would be grateful. To the Shenbao Newspaper Office. Enclosed is a photo. From the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, November 1st.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Talking about Liang Zuoyou Again <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Liang Zuoyou donated 30 million yuan. I have discussed this several times. Now, talking about Liang Zuoyou again might be annoying. But I dare not talk about people with higher status than Liang Zuoyou. And there's no need to talk about people less worthy than Liang Zuoyou. So, I can only talk about Liang Zuoyou again.</p>
<p>When the news of Liang Zuoyou's donation of 30 million yuan first spread, I was very skeptical. I thought it was a false story. Now it has become clear that it was indeed a deceptive act. According to news from Beijing yesterday, Liang Zuoyou, who claimed to donate funds to save the country, failed in his plan and was exposed. Ashamed to face people, he returned to his hometown of Huang County, Shandong Province, with his entourage on the Jinpu Railway the day before yesterday. The farce of donating huge sums of money that shocked the country has finally come to an end.</p>
<p>But Liang Zuoyou went to Beijing with his entourage to petition, destroy his family to save the country, and donate huge sums of money. In reality, it was a "empty city strategy." Anyone with common sense would know that this kind of trick would not work. But Liang Zuoyou shamelessly visited officials and deceived the people. His plan and actions showed that he was not mentally ill. He would not have dared to be so bold and reckless, speaking nonsense. It seems that he should be ignored and not discussed.</p>
<p>However, Liang has been in Beijing for a long time, and his attitude is calm, and his words are ambiguous. He does not seem to be mentally ill. And the result is completely deceptive. Not a penny has been paid. Not only have the people been deceived, but the government has also been tricked. Such a cunning person should be punished by the government to warn against such trickery.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Niter "Ammonia" NH3 <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Zhanneng</p>
<p>Ammonia is a very important compound in commerce. For example, liquefied ammonia is used as a refrigerant, and large amounts of ammonia are used to manufacture sodium carbonate. In agriculture, its compounds can be used as fertilizers. It also has considerable uses in medicine and industry.</p>
<p>Now, let's discuss its manufacture, properties, and uses in three sections:</p>
<p>(A) Manufacture: It can be divided into commercial production methods and laboratory production methods.</p>
<p>Commercial production methods: Distillation of coal is a major source of ammonia in commerce and is a very valuable by-product. Therefore, in factories that produce gas and coke on a large scale, when coal is distilled, the gas produced is washed with water to obtain a large amount of ammonia liquor. Then, the solution is separated from the tar, and then lime is added to combine with the acids, and heated, and the ammonia is driven out. (If it is passed into sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid, ammonium sulfate or ammonium chloride can be obtained.)</p>
<p>Laboratory production methods:</p>
<p>(1) Use a mixture of slaked lime and ammonium salts (such as ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, etc.), and water, and heat in a still with a duct, and ammonia can be obtained.</p>
<p>Ca(OH)2 + 2NH4Cl → CaCl2 + 2NH4OH</p>
<p>NH4OH → NH3 + H2O</p>
<p>(2) Warming ammonia liquor also produces this gas (this gas is easily soluble in water, so it must be collected over mercury, or collected in an inverted bottle using the downward displacement of air method).</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The ammonia gas produced in the laboratory must be dried using quicklime as a drying agent.</p>
<p>(B) Properties:</p>
<p>(1) Physical properties: Ammonia is a colorless gas with a peculiar pungent odor. The density of the gas is slightly greater than that of air, and it is easily soluble in water. A 35% solution is sold as "concentrated ammonia liquor." Liquefied ammonia is often used for freezing and refrigeration. Because when ammonia in the liquid state evaporates at -33 degrees Celsius, each gram can absorb 330 calories of heat, it is an excellent refrigerant.</p>
<p>(2) Chemical properties: The properties of ammonia are quite unstable, and it almost completely decomposes at 700 degrees.</p>
<p>Ammonia can burn in pure oxygen (it does not burn in air), producing water vapor and free nitrogen. 4NH3 + 3O2 → 2N2 + 6H2O</p>
<p>Many oxides, when burned, can be reduced if ammonia is passed over them. 3CuO + 2NH3 → 3Cu + 3H2O + N2</p>
<p>Oxygen and bromine vapor can combine with the hydrogen in ammonia and cause the nitrogen to dissociate. 2NH3 + 3Cl2 → N2 + 6HCl</p>
<p>If a metal that can combine with nitrogen (such as magnesium) is heated in a stream of ammonia gas, the hydrogen will be substituted.</p>
<p>3Mg + 2NH3 → Mg3N2 + 3H2</p>
<p>Ammonia reacts with potassium and sodium to form amidides (compounds containing the NH2 radical), such as sodium amide NaNH2.</p>
<p>2NH3 + Na → 2NaNH2 + H2</p>
<p>At temperatures below -79.3 degrees, ammonia can also combine with water to form solid white ammonium hydroxide.</p>
<p>NH3 + H2O → NH4OH</p>
<p>The most notable property of ammonia is that it combines with acids to produce ammonium salts.</p>
<p>NH3 (gas) + HCl (gas) → NH4Cl (solid)</p>
<p>2NH3 (gas) + H2SO4 (liquid) → (NH4)2SO4 (solid)</p>
<p>(C) Uses: Ammonia gas itself can be used as a refrigerant and to manufacture sodium carbonate, etc., but its salts are even more important.</p>
<p>Ammonium sulfate: is a very important artificial fertilizer in agriculture, with a nitrogen content of 24.25% to 25%. This substance can be used to manufacture various ammonium salts, such as ammonium chloride, ammonium carbonate, ammonium hydroxide, etc. Commercially sold ammonium sulfate is usually light gray in color and often contains small amounts of acid and water.</p>
<p>Ammonium chloride: commonly known as sal ammoniac, is obtained by decomposing ammonium sulfate with sodium chloride (i.e., table salt) or potassium chloride. It can be purified by sublimation. It is commonly used in batteries and also in calico printing and welding. It can be used to manufacture dyes and also has considerable uses in medicine.</p>
<p>Ammonium bromide: is used in photography and medicine.</p>
<p>Ammonium fluoride: is used to etch glass.</p>
<p>Ammonium carbonate: can be made by heating a mixture of ammonium sulfate, chalk, and a small amount of charcoal. It is used to manufacture smelling salts, baking powder, cosmetics, and ammonium-based dyes. It is used for washing and also in medicine.</p>
<p>In addition, important phosphate salts include ammonium phosphate, used to manufacture artificial fertilizers, ammonium nitrate, used to manufacture explosives, and ammonium vanadate, used to manufacture black ink and for printing and dyeing fabrics, etc.</p>
<p>Social Improvement Discussion Group</p>
<h3 id="e197">Discussion of the "Society Improvement Discussion Group" <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Shouyi</p>
<p>Recently, this newspaper's supplement has a column called "Society Improvement Discussion Group." In it, regarding all kinds of issues that we are dissatisfied with in society and consider should be improved, we have the opportunity to propose them for discussion, so as to gather everyone's opinions and decide whether to improve or abolish them. It goes without saying that the intention is very good.</p>
<p>The issues raised in this column are of varying sizes. Some can be improved by the ability of one person alone, such as "Improving Gift Giving," "Eliminating Bad Habits of Smoking and Drinking," "Improving Children's Sleep," etc. Some require the power of the masses to improve, such as "Abolishing Saturday Holidays," "School Fee Issues," "Reforming the Almanac," etc. However, no matter how the improvement is carried out, the problems raised for improvement are indeed worth discussing, and there is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>However, merely proposing discussions in this way, to let everyone know how to improve, is good, but if it is not put into practice, it is equivalent to empty talk. The reason why our country has been shouting slogans of "reform" and "overthrow" for decades, and the result is still equal to zero, is for this reason. Because in view of this point, I have further hopes for this column, and now I would like to discuss with the gentlemen who raised the questions.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, the purpose of discussing social improvement issues is to truly put them into practice, so it is best not to just write on paper, or specialize in discussing large topics in the sky, and then consider it done. On the one hand, we should, based on our own observations, use the power of the newspaper to widely promote issues that should be reformed. On the other hand, we should set an example by first practicing what we can do, such as eliminating the bad habits of smoking and drinking, and then report the results and benefits we have experienced to the public. In this way, everyone will see the satisfactory results and naturally follow suit. As for social systems that cannot be fundamentally resolved at one time, we can also use flexible methods to gradually seek reform. For example, abolishing Saturday holidays is not easy to change at once due to being stuck in habits, but we can use this time to do other work. As long as everyone practices in this way, is it not equivalent to not taking a holiday? After a long time, this habit can be abolished. Only when discussion and practice are carried out simultaneously like this, is there meaning, value, and is it not a waste of everyone's thoughts.</p>
<p>The improvement of society is the happiness of the masses, and this mission is borne by everyone. Therefore, although I am uneducated, I dare to contribute a little opinion without considering my own shallowness. If you gentlemen think that even the humble opinions are worth adopting, I hope that we will work together to implement them.</p>

<h3 id="e198">The Game of Money <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>丨One of the Street Scenes丨</p>
<p>Old Chen, the coppersmith, walked out of the company's accounting office happily, holding this month's salary – ten silver dollars. He thought to himself, his wife once said: When you get your salary, you have to buy a piece of clothing for your son, but what's enough with this little money! Six dollars for rent, three dollars owed to the rice shop, and four dimes to be returned to Li Mazi, and you have to buy firewood and salt... Ah, what's enough with this little money! He thought, blankly stepping onto the asphalt road.</p>
<p>Four dimes for a dollar... Come win money, everyone..., a burst of drawn-out voices escaped from a large, dark crowd beside the road. At the same time, one dime went in, two dimes went in, a chorus of silver dimes.</p>
<p>What trick is it again? A great consciousness urged him to take a closer look.</p>
<p>This was a gambling stall. A wooden board table was decorated with red and green dots, arranged into heaven, earth, man, and me, four cards. The table was even pasted with two red paper slogans, "To gamble, you must think carefully, look at the cards to divide winning and losing," which were considered the gambler's slogans! The onlookers included those in short clothes and those in long gowns, men and women. Hundreds and thousands of eyes were focused on a small box on the table. The fate of these many people betting money all depended on this square inch of bamboo. In this opening and changing, copper coins were constantly moving.</p>
<p>Old Chen, the coppersmith, watched blankly. The skinny man in short clothes next to him won every bet. His four-dime capital had already won more than five dollars. The tall man across from him was not bad either, winning two or three dollars. He thought to himself, it's really a lucky thing. At this time, the sound of "four dimes for a dollar" and the sound of silver dollars were constantly echoing. What a tempting sound, it moved Old Chen's heart, making him involuntarily pull out the remaining two dimes in his pocket, and follow the skinny man丨he trusted his skills丨to bet on the "heaven" card.</p>
<p>"Four dimes minimum!" said the person at the stall. The two dimes were finally returned to his own hand, but this time, he happened to open his eyes and watch the skinny man win another dollar. Endless frustration aroused his greatest determination. He solemnly stuffed the silver dollar he earned with his blood and sweat, betting four dimes on the table. This was the first time ever, and he actually won a dollar, which made him very grateful for the skinny man's hint. The addition of a dollar to his pocket surpassed the price of a day's labor. How joyful it should be! He thought, the money for the child's clothes is there. But the human heart is insatiable, shouldn't he bet again, so even the money for oil and sauce will be available? He thought. But the reality was never as beautiful as the ideal. Four dimes were rolled back to the dealer's side again, even the skinny man was frustrated. Things were really not ordinary.</p>
<p>One bet after another, the bottom of his pocket gradually lightened, and his worries gradually increased. Feeling in his pocket, there were only two dollars left. He didn't want to leave, but what would happen if he didn't leave? He was lost, and lost all faith.</p>
<p>If I don't win this time, I won't gamble anymore! The skinny man, his comrade, put all three dollars in his hand on the line, looked at him and said. He had the air of burning his boats.</p>
<p>Yes, let's give it a shot! Excitement jumped into his heart, and he threw in the same amount. But unfortunately, willpower did not triumph over reality. Ten dollars were all recorded in the dealer's account for today's income. He went crazy, as if waking up from a big dream. He remembered everything... rent... debts to the rice shop... the child's clothes... He wanted to grab back the money he had lost, but for what reason? He went straight to the side of the room, and they would say he was a criminal, a thief. However, what reason did they have to take my money? His chaotic thoughts finally forced him to leave the gambling stall in a daze.</p>
<p>Four dimes for a dollar... the drawn-out voice still did not lose its seductive power. The second gambler was just beginning to follow in Old Chen's footsteps.</p>
<p>School Scene</p>
<h3 id="e199">Eccentric Person (?) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Bo</p>
<p>One morning, many anonymous slogans were found on the walls of our school. They were painted with an ugly potato and a few crooked words: What kind of bookworm, eccentric person!... After reading it, I was really baffled, and couldn't figure it out for a while.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that this was a slogan alluding to a student with a shaved head.</p>
<p>I still don't quite understand, what's the big deal with shaving one's head like a monk? Why make such a fuss? Comparing a monk's head to a potato, is it an insult? No, I think it's just a boring act! The student with the monk's head is a freshman. He never pays attention to dressing up. His rough black face never seems to have anything applied to it. A set of old student clothes, the sleeves of which are almost the same size as his feet. He wears a pair of Chaplin-style leather shoes, the heels of which are almost gone. All of this, all of this is his eternal mark. Studying in the fashionable modern student world like this, he is sure to make people look at him differently. However, he can't catch up with others in the pursuit of fashion, but he is already many steps ahead of others in his studies.</p>
<p>In the morning, the students are all dreaming sweet dreams. When there is only a little light that is not enough to read, he puts on a blanket, drags his wooden clogs, and runs to the grass to recite his monk scriptures. When it gets light, the students on the grass gradually increase, but he squats alone in the dormitory, studying hard.</p>
<p>Usually in the library, on the lawn, under the shade of trees, anyone can see him alone with a book and a pen, reading. Sometimes he is seen looking up and mumbling what he is reading, sometimes he is seen staring at a grass and a tree in a daze. Playful people see him and call out his nickname, "Potato"... but he seems not to hear it, neither angry nor showing any expression.</p>
<p>On Sundays and holidays, I have bumped into him several times reading in the deep paths of the park. If you greet him sincerely, he will at most return a bow and a smile. People have never seen him smile, and it seems that his life lacks the element of laughter.</p>
<p>He is very diligent. He washes his own clothes. As for watching movies and buying snacks, I don't think he does that. At most, it's only once or twice every six months.</p>
<p>Like this, he is indeed an eccentric person in the modern, fashionable, so-called advanced student world. But I always hope that more like him will be produced.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3 id="e200">Interesting Plaques <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Shi</p>
<p>Once I was returning from ×× town, and happened to pass behind my cousin's Wancun. I took the opportunity to visit his house. As I was about to step into his study, I saw him holding a plaque in both hands, instructing a servant as if he was about to send it somewhere. When he saw me, he immediately smiled, shook hands, and exchanged polite words, which need not be said. The servant also stood by, waiting for his instructions. At this time, I looked at the plaque, which read, "Congratulations to the Newly Appointed Director of the ×× Department of ××," and below it read, "Respectfully Offered by Brother ××." Only the middle part was truly peculiar, it read "Bin Ka Jian Ni" four magnificent characters. After reading it, I was really at a loss, and asked him what it meant. He gave a cold laugh and calmly said to me, "This newly appointed director was my classmate for several years. His father used to be a ×× adjutant under the command of the ×× warlord. Once, this warlord and another ×× warlord fought for power, and unfortunately, they were defeated. Soldiers scattered everywhere. His old man also took this opportunity to loot civilian property while the fire was raging. He never served as an official again, and returned to his hometown to enjoy his great fortune. Now he has opened two opium dens in the ×× trading port, which is very impressive. A few days ago, he spent 10,000 sinful silver dollars to buy this official position. Is it wrong or not for me to send him a plaque with such words?" At this time, I just agreed casually, and asked him to explain it to me. He continued to say to me, "If you really want to hear the meaning of these four characters, it is quite accurate. If you ask about his talent, he is neither cultured nor martial. Putting the two characters 'culture' and 'martial' together makes the character 'Bin'. If you ask about his ambition, it is neither up nor down. Putting the two characters 'up' and 'down' together makes the character 'Ka'. If you ask about his ability, it is neither small nor big. Putting the two characters 'small' and 'big' together makes the character 'Jian'. If you talk about his personality, he is really not like a human, nor like a ghost (which can be compared to the common saying in the countryside, 'half-cooked red millet'). Putting the two characters 'human' and 'ghost' together makes the character 'Ni'. My brother, I have compiled these four characters 'Bin Ka Jian Ni' into a sentence to send to him, isn't he worthy of it?" When I heard him say this, I finally opened my confused gourd, and couldn't help but burst into a miserable laugh.</p>

<p>Zhen Shan Mei Store: Recently, the school uniform fabrics adopted by various girls' schools in Shanghai are mostly checked fabrics and roselle patterned fabrics, which are purely native products purchased from the countryside. They are quite simple and durable, and the fashion is temporary. The Zhen Shan Mei Store at 1237 Zhonghua Road, South Xiaoximen, has this kind of fabric for sale. It is said that the prices are very low.</p>
