<h3>日内瓦充滿悲觀空氣</h3>
<p>我認决議草案不澈底</p>
<p>日本亦表示拒絕接受</p>
<p>十九特委會討論勢將延宕至明春</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日内瓦現滿佈關於中日爭議之悲觀空氣、衆慮五國小組委員會所擬之草案、其談判或將延宕多時、故若干方面頗有待至耶誕節與新年休期後再行討論之趨向、中國方面以爲此草案未有澈底辦法、而日人則認目前形式之草案、爲莫可接受、但有顯見者、雙方似皆不致擔負堅决拒絕之責任、蓋拒絕此草案、等於拒絕調解手續、而國聯即將採用國聯盟約第十五條第四節之條文也、該節條文曰、「倘爭議不能如此解决、則行政院經全體或多數多表决、應繕發報告書、說明爭議之事實及行政院所認爲公允適當之建議、」果爾則將發生嚴重後果、無論何人涉念及此、未有不深切憂懼者、雖始終主張嚴峻行逕之小國、對於此種局勢之可能性、亦爲之惶遽不寗、今日午後五國小組委員會集議三小時、聞秘書長與十九特委會主席相繼報告與中代表顏博士日代表松岡談話之結果、雖接洽時、兩造皆未接到政府訓令、但雙方皆能根據其所接尋常訓令、而作初步之建議、明日午後小組委員會將再集議、届時中日代表當已接到政府覆示、十九特委會原有星期一日開會之說、但一般印象、以爲將有在耶誕節後始繼續討論之必要、因中日雙方對此提案、皆將有反對之表示也、提交中日政府之草案原文大旨如下、</p>
<p>第一提案、聲明十九特委會有勉力解决此爭議而不繕具報告書之義務、故根據三月十一日之决議案、在此草案中、確定任何解决必須與國聯盟約非戰公約與九國公約之傾向相適合、十九特委會之工作、在會同爭議中兩造、根據李頓報告書第九章之條陳、並顧及第十章之建議、指導談判、又說明調解委員會須由十九特委會產生、須有　邀請美俄之合作、並有權、採行其所認爲必要以履行其職務之任何計畫、調解會須於三月一日繕具報告書、如届時不能獲有同意、則調解會得向迄未停會之國聯大會報告之、</p>
<p>第二提案、對於李頓調查團之工作、表示感謝、並謂李頓報告書將始終爲忠實與不偏袒的工作之模範、兩提案後附說明書、供委員會之指導、說明書引　十二月九日决議案、並一再聲明委員會之工作、爲根據盟約第十五條第三節而辦理之調解、說明書勸從速辦理、並建議應以權力給與專家、該尃家須受三月十一日决議案之指導、以李頓報告書之八章及第九章所載之原則爲根據、並顧及第十章、說明書又說明事非恢復原狀之簡單、亦不可使現狀賡續、（十六日路透電）</p>
<h3>我國要求</h3>
<p>修改决議草案</p>
<p>（外部昨致代表團訓電）</p>
<p>旣未規定最後報告期限</p>
<p>更無阻止日本侵略辦法</p>
<p>（南京）十九國委會通過五國所起草决議草案、經顏惠慶電外部請示、該草案共四項、㈠對報告書表示忻慰留待調解委員會引用、㈡重行確定三月十一日决議、申述仍應履行、㈢提議以十九國委會加入中日代表、改爲調解委員會、㈣邀請美俄加入調解委會、外羅接到顏電後、與宋子文及在京外委商議結果、確已於十六深夜發出重要訓令至顏、表示異常失望、囑顏答復十九國委會要求、須將該草案、加以修改後、中國始能接收、聞我方不滿意者、因該决議旣未確定製成最後報告之日期、更未規定對制裁侵略者之辦法、對我國在國聯大會歷次各項要求、一槪抹煞、故難接收、該訓令預料十七中午可到日内瓦、（十七日專電）</p>
<h3>日本如不放棄</h3>
<p>僞滿國之承認</p>
<p>中日案無討論餘地</p>
<p>我代表團發表一文</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國代表團發方人今日發表一文、說明中政府對於十九特委會决議草案之意見、謂日本苟不表示其誠意願接受此草案爲討論之基礎、則進行詳細之討論、徒費時耳、吾人所可據以進行調解工作之一種必要條件、爲日本應放棄其所謂「滿洲國」云、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國代表團發言人宣稱、十九國委員會之决議草案、令人大失所望、其言曰「此項决議草案、遠在吾人希望之下、其最大之點、爲最後報告書原應按中國請求規定確切日期、乃决議草案對於此點、竟付闕如、此層尤足使人失望、此外又未採取任何方法、以應付滿洲時局、或防止日本人使不致加重時局之嚴重、」（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>起草委員會曲意順從日本</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）衆信起草委員會因日代表之反對、現已考慮將草案之一點·及理由說明書之二三點加以修改、日方所反對者、顯爲以李頓報告書第九十兩章所載調解辦法爲根據之提議、蓋以此將限制委員會之權能也、聞日本又反對委員會草案中之特别言及美俄兩國、按國聯向美俄探詢加入調解之意見後、僅得微溫之答覆、如邀請問題不取消、則起草委員會定將覓一方案、以銷釋此項反對、其道在含蓄請美俄加入之意、而不切實言明之、（十七日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日政府訓電松岡内容</h3>
<p>要求修正原案</p>
<p>冀避戎首責任</p>
<p>拒絕美俄參加</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>爲英政府府進一解並正告世界明</h3>
<p>自本月七日英外相西門在國聯大會席上發表其袒日言論而後本報曾兩次論評。於其認識不足與夫將由此益以促進世界之糾紛頗深致惋惜乃者。英政府當局。有所聲明。謂西門在國聯大會所發言論用意在促進和解並無偏袒任何一方之意此種表示。固極足以使世界公正人士之耳目爲之一新。疑慮爲之盡袪。惟是吾人尙有不能已於言者。輒願爲英政府進一解並以正千世界。</p>
<p>英當局之言曰。「英國爲國聯忠實會員。對於盟約尊嚴之維持。决不後人。」此種表示固極堅决而光明。但就事實而言。去年九一八禍變之發生。誰爲破壞盟約之禍首。雖三尺黃騃應無不知之。然而荏苒一年。東北事件在國聯中迄未獲得若何公正解决之辦法。國聯每有决議。日本無不悍然予以破壞。而國聯則亦竟爲强暴所懾服爲敷衍世人之耳目乃。有派遣調查團之舉。吾人於此。固即深慮維護國際間正義與和平之莊嚴盟約。將從此爲强暴所一手撕碎。</p>
<p>此次大會重開。李頓調查團之報告書。旣巳將東北禍變之實際情况。明白獻陳於大大而此一年來日本繼續不絕之暴行。如再犯熱河。如正式承認僞組織。尤足使國聯明白認淸日本之面目。在吾人之初意。以爲東北事件在國聯中。今次庶幾其有獲得公正解决之望乎。殊不料今之國聯。仍無殊於昨之國聯。集全世界政治家外交家於一堂。竟終不能維護正義而予强暴以合法之制裁。</p>
<p>調查團旣爲國聯所委派。其報告當爲國聯所信賴。而在本届大會中。尤應根據此種報告。實施公正之裁判。按報告書中。對於九一八禍變之結語。有極確定之兩點。㈠九一八晚之日軍暴行不能認爲自衛之行動。㈡滿洲僞國。不能認爲由眞正及自然之獨立運動所產生夫非爲自衛。即爲侵略。非爲眞正自然之獨立運動所產生。即爲日本一手所包辦。事實昭彰。世所共見。國聯旣不肯依據報告書中所認定之事實。决然予以公正之裁判。而自稱國聯之「忠實盟員」英國代表西門氏。反公然羲表袒日之言詞。故爲强暴張目。使正義沉銷盟約破碎。則世界公正人士對於英倫之深致惋惜。對於國聯尤表示無窮之失望。寗其足怪。</p>
<p>今英當局旣已明白宣示其光明这態度。矣此種光明之態度。誠爲國聯所利賴。亦即爲世界和平所利賴。然而吾人尤切盼英當局於切實表示其光明態度之外。更嚴之以正確之事責。即基於維護盟約與維護和平之立塲上。對大會作公正之建議。或竟能如英波油案中英决然授引盟約第十五條之態度。依據盟約第十五條對大會建議予强勢以有效之裁嗣。俾公理終得以伸。和平終得以維持則英政府正直之態度與捬神。當更爲全世界公正之人士所共仰矣。</p>
<p>次之。吾人猶有敢爲英政府曁世界各國正千者。中國人民今日雖處於暴力刦持之下。但深信强暴終不能呑沒正義且終必爲正義所屈服。同時深信中華民族欲謀自身獨立生存之自由。捨以自力自救而外。更無他道。中國人民固切盼國聯以及全世界公正人士之共起而。主持正義。但决不依賴國聯。更决不肯信賴任何一國。以自力自救幷以維護國際盟約與正義和平。中國人民。今已具此决心。鬭而已。强暴終當陳屍於正義之足前。</p>

<p>國民社十六日華盛頓電今日確悉美總統胡佛對於解决戰债問題、現正考慮三種手續㈠由國會設立戰債委員會、胡佛仍認此爲三策中之最上策、但亦知國會將反對此種機關之復活、㈡由現有外交機關與各债　國分别談判、倘果採行此手續、則胡佛希望各國能提出有價値之報告與建議、俾將來可得國會相當之贊助㈢由總統自行派非正式委員與外國官吏接洽戰债問題、然後將歐洲情形及繼續現行還債程序表後所將產生之經濟狀况、或滅讓一部份後在經濟界之結果等、作爲詳盡報告、俾總統可較易向國會提出特别建議、惟不論胡佛擇取何種手續、聞將不再與羅斯福商榷、蓋胡佛現將力圖於任期未滿前解决此事、設果不能、則移歸下任總統接辦又聞胡佛對於法國所欠戰債雖屬愆付、亦願討論修改恊定之可能性、第仍不欲參加任何戰債會議耳、昨日法·比·匈牙利·愛沙尼亞·與波蘭五國愆付戰債、美人視之並不驚異、今日財長發表此次愆付總額共一四·九九六·五五一·八五金元、又英·意·捷克·芬蘭·拉特維亞·與立陶宛所付總數、共九八·六八五·九、○·六三金元、</p>

<p>▲華聯社十七日東京電日經擠界爲侵略軍費國家空虚、愈形恐慌、日本銀行發十一萬萬之鈔票、兌現金塊僅四萬萬元、因此匯兌漸跌、故日野尋金若狂、昨年中謂在台灣山中發現二十萬萬之砂金鑛、政界財界及報界均派人調查、竟無所得、今年則組織掃海尋金公司、欲索數年前沈海之運金俄艦、今又有三木武吉說、在北海道發見埋有四十萬萬元之金鑛、已設法試掘、今日上午九時三木由北海道返東京、出迎之金狂者甚衆、日政府已决定撥二十萬之經費、在台灣與朝鮮兩地試掘金鑛、可謂日人舉國爲金熱狂矣、</p>
<p>德廢皇回國禁令將撤銷</p>
<h3>復辟謠言復起</h3>
<p>國民社十六日柏林電今日德文世界報載稱、德政府將立即取消廢皇威廉回國之禁後、德國人民復紛紛注意復辟之可能性、據該報載稱、保障共和法、將於本年十二月底滿期、内閣將於明日會商展期問題、大約僅將撤銷廢皇回國之禁、並删去其他數項、其中大部份規定、仍當保留、至關於復辟一層、今日據稱目下人民旣不要求回復帝制、即令撤去廢皇回國之禁亦不能解釋爲復辟企圖、某評論家曾說明時局、謂德國在法律上爲一共和民治國、但並無主張民治主義者、設令廢皇回國後、亦將見其國家並無主張恢復君主者、又一般意見亦認此舉僅欲准廢皇回國、與家屬團聚而巳、並無其他用意云、</p>
<h3>美民主黨之亞西亞政策（下）</h3>
<p>約翰海聲明曰、「吾人爲維持美國國民生活起見、中國實爲美國人商業上及工業上之企業地、須要求其門戶開放及機會均等、在中國扶楠勢力範圍、或在該國有租借地、並宜撤廢美國對華通商上或條約上一切之差則待遇、如是方可維持美國永久之繁榮與增進美國人之福祉、」美國自約翰海發表聲明後、有識者均認爲正當論調、故不論可黨當權、决不變更此政策、因此美國之亞西亞政策、表面上雖着重於經濟方面、而實際上對於政治的勢力、亦極注意也</p>
<p>然而日本與英國、旣在中國扶植經濟的勢力、特日本自日淸戰爭後、在中國政治經濟的勢力、日益伸張、已不可侮、則美國欲圖在中國擴大扶植優越權、其勁敵即爲日本、何也、英國在華經濟的勢力、經鴉片戰爭後、漸形衰頽、惟日本則逐年膨脹、美國如欲實行約翰海之政策、不得不抑制昌本耳、</p>
<p>㈢美國政策之不變與事實如上所述、美國之亞西亞政策、原爲壓迫日本政策、此政策在羅斯福大總統時代以來、力圖實現、日俄大戰後、羅斯福以調停自任、美國鐵道大王哈利曼、極力運動南滿鐵道之管理權、嗣遭日本之拒絕、復與英國恊同、將　設錦愛鐵道、又爲日俄兩國所拒絕、其後民主黨代共和黨執掌政權、（威爾遜）美國之極東政策、表面上似告變更、迨一九一四年歐洲大戰勃發、日本以日英同盟關係、奪取靑島、佔據德國在山東一切權利、翌年日本向華提出二十一條、此時美國即起而反對、其後中國以恊商國之名義參加大戰美國慫恿中國政府、將中國與德國間所締一切條約、宣言世界、均告無效、及歐洲大戰告終、巴黎　和平會議、日本政府之重要提案、即關於靑島與山東省一切權利均被拒絕、此皆因威爾孫大總統之作祟、有以致之、幸當時爲阜姆問題、美意兩國全權發生衝突意國金權脫退議席、平和會議幾致决裂、美恐日本亦傚　國、不得已容許日本之提案、然而美國之壓迫日本、仍一貫不變蓋美國因襲約翰海之政策、非達到目的不已、</p>
<p>㈣日美兩國難避之運命至一九二○年、威爾遜選舉失敗、共和黨哈定繼任總統、召集華盛頓會議、先通過拒絕日本移民法案繼以倫敦會議、又施種種壓迫手段於日本使日本陷於孤立之境、良以彼之亞西亞政策、徵諸過去事　成不變、而我國（日本）人士以爲此次民主黨獲勝、可以變更其亞西亞政策、豈非夢嘆乎、今日本人嘗曰滿蒙爲日本生命線、願賭國家之運命、然美國人亦曰中國爲美國之生命線、必不任日本之宰割、而放棄其百年之大計也、余故曰、遥隔太平洋兩岸之日美、互欲爭奪此中國之好餌、勢必發生雙方之戰爭、一决雌雄而後已、願國人（日本人）羣起猛省、勿惑於不明世界大勢者之謬論也、（完）</p>

<p>數百年來、日本軍人努力提倡之結晶之雙管齊下的大陸開展政策、其第一步即着眼於中國、以爲戰勝亞洲全部之始點、其進行也、南北同時着手、適與毒蠍之同時以首尾攻擊其犧牲品略似、於此吾人即可了然於一八九四五年中日戰爭終了之後、何以日本堅欲中國割讓遼東半島、及台灣島、於此吾人乃可深悉日本於一八七九年攫取中國琉球羣島、以至日俄戰後之佔據南滿、併呑朝鮮、一九一一年之派兵深入揚子江流域中心之漢口、一九一四年丨一九二二年之佔據山東、一九一五年之提出甘一條、以及其躊躇撤回東部西伯利亞之遠征軍、一九二七年及一九二八年之派大軍至濟南、最後乃及於一九三一年九月十八十九之攻佔瀋陽及其他各城、佔據東三省全部、不顧全世界輿論自食其諾言違反其義務、而不肯澈兵之眞正意義矣、吾人就大木喬任之言測之、可知日本政府於一九零七年·一九一零年·一九一二年·及一九一六年疊次與俄政府商訂密約、圖謀瓜分滿蒙、及於一九一七年關於南滿及山東省對各國秘密換文之眞正目的矣、而日政府最近擬丨設法在歐洲各國中、覓一同盟國之用意、亦可曉然無疑、吾人敢言、日本此項爲新中國領袖人物所曾知之大陸政策、實爲遠東和平之眞正威脅、實爲世界各國之最大騷亂因素、而其所以有如此重大之危險性者、則厥因在此政策之後、爲一擅作威福而不悔之軍閥勢力、握有最有威力之戰具、而饜足其慾望之方法、又處處維持武力及强權者也、中國在過渡時期不可避免之不穩狀態、雖不宜任其不需要的延長、其本身要與以法治及國際間用和平方法解决爭端之原則作根據之國際新生命無衝突、日本軍閥、不斷的阻碍中國之統一、增加中國之困難、利用中國之種種艱苦、如水災及共黨騷擾等、以推進其土地開展及大陸征服政策、凡此種種、始爲中日兩國間和平諒解之眞正障碍、試觀六十年來中日關係之歷史、即可證余言之不謬、六十年來日本對華不斷的戰爭、軍事遠征、及侵略行動、雖其表現之時地各殊、而其背後之開展佔領及克服政策、則繼續一貫絕無異致也、吾人應注意此項政策、其目標並不僅在取得滿蒙而止、據日本前首相田中義一之奏摺、丨該奏摺在一九三一年九月之前、日本報紙時時引證之、對於其眞實性、絕未嘗加以懷疑、丨控制中國之東三省、不過爲克服全世界秩序中之一步、摺中有言、</p>

<p>海軍索修艦費</p>
<h3>福海巡艦發生誤會</h3>
<p>武裝海軍駛往該艦索欠</p>
<p>福海兵士實彈射擊示威</p>
<p>實業部浙江區海洋漁業管理局、於去歲曾將該局之福海巡艦、託由海軍部江南造船修理、昨日下午一時、海軍當局因該艦積欠修費、迄未淸償、特派員隨同衛兵、赴該艦索欵同時福海巡艦方面、亦以漁業管理局積欠士兵工薪五個半月、生活不能維持、見海軍全副武裝、形勢洶洶、以爲將繳彼等之械、故向水中實彈開放一槍示威、同時下令特别警備、不聽登艦、海軍方面恐釀事端、故即離去、靜候交涉、茲分誌詳情如下、</p>
<h3>託修巡艦</h3>
<p>緣漁業管理局有福海巡艦一艘、專在溫台等處戈巡保護漁船、前因艦身損、曾於去歲託由海軍部江南造船所代爲修理、先後積欠修理費洋二萬餘元、屢次派員赴該局索取、因該局經費困難、歷任局長、均未能淸償稽延迄今、尙未付淸</p>
<h3>海軍索欠</h3>
<p>江南造船所方面、以該局對於欠欵、久不歸還、殊屬非是、而該所本身年來經費、亦感拮据、故於昨日下午一時、由海軍第一艦隊司令部方面、派海軍警衛營第三連第一排排長王文波、三排排長劉兆璞、率同衛兵二十餘人、分乘海軍水巡隊江南江康兩小輪、駛往福海巡艦、索取欠費、</p>
<h3>發生誤會</h3>
<p>漁業管理局現停泊於本埠之護漁巡艦、計有福海·海膺·兩艘、均泊於南市關橋黃浦江中、當海部王劉兩排長所乘之江南江康兩小輪、於下午二時許、駛抵福海巡艦、相差尙有一丈左右時、王排長當由江南輪艙中起立輪首、擬與福海巡艦人員說明來意、不幸竟發生誤會、</p>
<h3>開放一槍</h3>
<p>當時福海巡艦方面誤會來意、即用駁壳槍向水中實彈開放一槍示威、同時將該艦首之機關槍砲衣卸除、作嚴重之警戒、拒絕海軍士兵登艦、同時海軍之王劉兩排長、恐事態擴大、且該處浦江中、爲商輪往來要道、日淸公司亦有三輪停靠附近、稍一不愼、足以引起外交糾紛、故一面搖手向海安艦示意、一面約束衛兵、不准還擊、相持約十餘分鐘、海軍兩小輪即駛開、暫靠附近大通碼頭、並飛報海軍警衛營長葉寳琦氏、轉呈陳季良司令核辦、</p>
<h3>葉氏談話</h3>
<p>出事後、記者特往晤海軍警衛警營長葉寳琦氏、據談、今日奉司令命令、派王劉兩排長率同衛兵、乘坐小輪、赴福海巡艦接洽要公、詎兩小輪甫行駛近該艦之身、而該艦竟不問情由、實彈開槍、射中江南輪之機艙外、續復擬開放機關槍、當時情形不可理喻、幸所部衛兵尙明大義、未曾還擊、否則該處交通繁密、其結果當不堪設想矣、查本軍官兵、無論至何處、或至各外國軍艦、隨帶衛兵、均可通行、乃該艦竟不問情形、立即實彈射擊、誠屬可怪、現已將經過情形、報告司令部、當靜候司令部命令辦理云、</p>
<h3>福海理由</h3>
<p>本報記者昨晚十時親至南市大通碼頭附近調查、海軍兩小輪已不在該處、復乘舢板至停泊浦江中之福海巡艦詢問、當駛近時、福海士兵持槍喝問、情勢確極嚴重、據士兵談、福海艦長爲郭威、共有士兵五十餘名、漁業局已積欠工薪五個半月、士兵生活實在不能維持、今日（即昨日）下午海軍駕兩小輪駛近、形勢洶洶、令本艦下旗、我等以爲積欠不淸、尙欲假勢來艦繳械、爲自衛計、乃向水中實彈開放一槍示威、不令登艦、海軍無法、旋即駛去、至索欠一節、應向漁業管理局直接接洽、豈有向本艦交涉之理、</p>
<h3>夏騰飛之聲明</h3>
<p>北平長騰飛通電云申報新聞報時事新報公鑒、頃閱時事新報載稱、敝人决於眞日赴滬、參加東北各軍聯合通訊處、並向各方接洽援助等語、查駐滬聯合通訊處原爲各路義軍代表互通消息之總機關、並無其他作用、况敝軍一切接濟、現正由誠委員長辦理、敝人因公留平、亦未南下、倘有虚造空氣、槪不承認、深恐遠道傳聞失實、特電聲明、諸希察照、東北民衆救國軍副司令馮占海代表夏騰飛叩、</p>

<p>王志新君訊：關於職業之困難與夫學非所用，用非所學，在現時代的中國，已是盡人而知的事實。在貴刊上，也方幾討論過，我不想表示一點意見。尤其：在我作算是一個有了職業的人，雖是有些「牛頭不對馬嘴」有些不滿。但讀着爲飢餓而遊行與要求麵包的新聞也就可以安分了。但我要提出進一步的問題，即如何去維持我的職業！乾脆的說，就是怎樣來「保持飯碗」？因爲據我的感覺，而且見事實，飯碗的保住：不是憑能力，而是憑關係與狗性丨這，說的漂亮的是盡忠，一般點說是迎合趨奉，打開天窗說亮話是拍馬！然而，對於我，恰恰是非常爲難的條件！論關於，連一點點蟹脚絲的親戚都沒有，甚至是同鄕之類！脾氣又有點怪癖，連話都不大肯多說，遑論吹打？唯唯諾諾的假仁假義之奴性，自然更不會習得與效顰。但，飯碗可又不願意就丢了，該什麽辦丨說句笑話：把堂妹子介紹給經理嗎！或是要内子去做乾生女？要不然，自己就得搖身一變，堆上一臉的笑來强爲週旋嗎？這兒，敬懇着你們給我一個詳密的指敎吧。</p>
<p>覆：來書云云，確係事實，度亦不僅足下有此感應。然此究爲變態而非常態！在比較新式而又開明之機關，要巳革除此弊，非復來書所云矣。而其大前提，應仍謂爲經濟的丨蓋整個的生產形態，猶在封建的行程裏，則有此封建的血緣關係與奴隸性，又何足怪？外此：當推失業恐慌，蓋非然者，度亦不致如此，唯其求業多，乃先親屬而後外人，所謂「臂巴無向外曲」一文、力爲公司辯護、嗣經敝會加以痛駁在案、今該局所持理由、仍一味偏袒公司、徇私之見、氣乃太過、電話公司雖因改換新機、費用浩繁據其自述、自一九三○年八月五日公司成立時起至本年九月底止、共二十六個月之期間、總共損失二十一萬八千四百三十兩之譜、卽以二十六個月損失而言、上海電話公司、雖努力於擴充線路至四倍以上、辦事人員、又大半均雇用西員、厚其俸給、因糜費失算、而受有損失、亦爲當然之結果、不能作爲鉅額增價、及追溯旣往、補償新價之充足理由、爲今之計、如欲交涉解决風潮敉平、惟有由社會公正團體委派會計專家、審核公司賬目、加價是否應當、且所加之額是否合理、以求公平之解决、幸勿懾於壓迫、自甘放棄、以犧牲大多數人之利益也、則幸甚矣、（致納稅會）逕復者、接准十二月一日大復（與致市商會函相同從略）又查十一月十五日會致工部局函、至今尙未接得該局來復、未悉何故、合併附聞、並檢奉致該局函稿、統希察照爲荷、（附致工部局函稿、已見十一月十七日報本、又從略）、</p>
<h3>陳天嘯國難畫展第一天</h3>
<p>陳天嘯個人寫畫展覽救國、昨天在寗波同鄕會開幕、第一天到會參觀者、有葉恭綽·王一亭·許世英·潘天慧·許元慶·翁子光·呂鴻勛·徐瘦梅·高適·阮秋白·郭九如·等一千餘人、而携卷到抽籤者、亦近半數、參觀人士、多交口稱贊、且有當塲題字贊掦陳氏者、至其所印畫片、每張售洋一毫、購者甚多、國難期間内、以個人展覽救國如陳氏者、可謂首屈一指云、</p>
<p>之自然趨勢耳笑話云云，甚希其爲笑話，爲職業而如此，抑亦可恥之尤矣。至論堆一臉笑，則人與人之結合，原無刻板文章，曲意阿附，固不必：板板六十四，亦似勿宜，適可而止可也。</p>
<p>趙明誠君訊：我現在已到初中的最後一學期了。······我覺得最苦的便是作文。每每敎員把題目寫上黑板後，自己覺得有許多意思可以寫出來，待提起筆來，却又無可寫得了。······往往批着「枯澀」二字，甚至於「不通」。先生，怎樣纔會不枯澀，怎樣纔會通呢？敎員曾敎我們多看書。他曾開給我們一張很長的書目。我見了那張書目，起先是心慌意亂，不知看了那一本好，後來雖買了幾本，但總看不出興趣來。······况且這法子的效騐，未免太慢，先生，你可有較好的法子麽？</p>
<p>附註：就照敎員開的書目，我個人也决沒許多錢去完全買來。</p>
<p>覆，文章大槪離不開形式和内容兩部分。所謂内容便是一篇文章的實質，他所包含的材料：形式便是表達這内容的工具。有了表達的工具而沒有什麽表達出來，只是一個空架子；這便是「枯」。有了材料而不知怎麽表達出來，便是「澀」；或表達出來了，却和原意不合，或把表達的工具用錯了，便是「不通」。譬如一具桌子，桌面是方的或圓的，三脚的或四脚的；便是形式。松木的，栗木或鋼鐵的，便是内容。單在紙面上圖一具桌子，形式雖具，却是空的，沒有實用的價値；這便是枯。單是一堆木材或鋼鐵亦不</p>

<h3>上海縣遷治元旦日起實行</h3>
<p>縣黨部建敎兩局先遷</p>
<p>縣府及財務局等繼之</p>
<p>上海縣遷治問題、自呈奉蘇民廳核准後、即由縣政府建設局繪就圖樣、招標建築、自動工以來、迄今凡六閱月、工程已告完竣、縣政府方面已定於元旦日著手遷移、茲將各情、誌之如下、</p>
<h3>新治落成</h3>
<p>自上海市政府成立以後、所有管轄之處、均劃入市區、致縣政府雖設在市區、而其施政之處、則均在四鄕鎭、故遂有遷治之議、中間曾由縣政府方面、擬具遷治計畫、連同圖樣及預算等、呈經蘇民廳核准、遂於本年六月間、以七萬五千餘元、招標承造、動工以來、工程頗爲迅速、現已全部落成、</p>
<h3>水電供給</h3>
<p>新縣治所在地、爲滬閔南柘路經過之北橋、其地商業淸淡、完全爲一鄕村、縣政府遷移是處、可實現總理「到民間去」之主張、新縣府之四週、環府馬路、亦已舖築完竣、電燈係由閔行商辦電燈公司在該處裝置一小發電機、發電供給全府電燈電流之用、飲料方面、因該處向無自來水、一時不便裝置、鑿自流井、亦恐一時不及、故目前即用新縣府前面竹葉浜水以作飲料、該浜在縣府前面、爲東西流、水通北廟涇、間接且通黃浦、</p>
<h3>交通便利</h3>
<p>環府馬路之兩旁、滿植樹木、以資點綴、現已種植完竣、因之風景頗佳、空氣尤爲淸新、由滬前往、有滬閔南柘路之長途車可通、至北橋站下車、交通亦頗便利、</p>
<h3>遷移程序</h3>
<p>據縣政府秘書葉德眞語華東社記者、新治房屋、已全部落成、裝修粉刷、亦即竣工、現已在掛設電綫、裝置電燈、定於明年元旦起、先行將縣黨部及建設局遷移、次遷敎育局及本府之直轄公安分駐所、能作桌子用：這便是澀。木材做成了桌子，不磨光，不上油漆，或是方不像方圓不像圓，該四隻脚的，裝了三隻脚，這亦不合實用；這便是不通。我們應該選用上好的材料，製出一具道地的合乎實用的桌子；這纔是文章的眞意義。足下作文「枯澀」或「不通」之病的對症藥，除了「多看書」以外沒有其他「較好的法子」。「多看書」三個大字的意義是非常重要的。第一，須知道所看的確實是本「書」，就是有價値的書。現在令師所開的自然有價値的，可以看的。第二，須眞是「看」，而不是翻書。逐字逐句地，不懂的便查或問·看時應時時注意同樣一層意思，我自己作便怎樣，作者的表達方法是否最善的。遇到有價値的思想或自己的悟得或美妙的辭句應立刻抄得或標出來。第三，須確實地「多」，</p>
<p>不在數字上而在實質上。如此切實地做，無所用其「心慌意亂」。天下事决無一步登天的「發横財」是沒出息人的念頭。凡是從刻苦耐勞中得來的纔算得自己的。足下求進心切，殊表同情，若嫌法子「太慢」，必蹈「欲速則不達」的覆轍。至購書問題，不妨組織讀書會，大家或是合資購買，輪流閱讀，到畢業時送給學校圖書館作紀念或大家抽籤分取；或是各購數種交互借閱，大家通力合作，便容易解决了。</p>
<p>至本府及財政局、因案卷甚多、尙須整理打包、故繼縣黨部及敎育局後遷移、一月月底、當可一律遷竣、</p>
<h3>另造宿舍</h3>
<p>此次遷移、爲便利辦公起見、特附造宿舍一所、以便職員居住、此項宿舍、係另行籌欵建築、甫於上月間始動工、須至二月間完竣、</p>
<h3>舊址用途</h3>
<p>至本府之現有府址、已讓於市政府、聞市府擬作市公安局之用、該局日前曾有人來察看一過、惟將來公安局遷移時、尙須大加修理耳、</p>
<h3>南市電燈息滅半小時</h3>
<p>昨晚六時三刻、南市老西門城内至小東門以達老北門一帶、電燈突然熄滅、南市全部、幾完全陷於黑暗狀態、祇有老北門迤西一段、尙保持原有光明、約歷半小時之久始復原狀、惟尙有一事、足以令人奇異者、即當燈滅時、南市全部忽發現一種甚大之嗡嗡吼聲、與火車起步時之洩氣聲相似、當時有人疑此聲與電炬熄滅有關、但電炬恢復後、其聲仍繼續不絕、良久始寂、至於電炬頓滅原因、聞係發電機方棚爆燬所致、</p>
<h3>「孤軍」攝影擊斃士兵滬訊</h3>

<h3>爲全國中學校請命（三）</h3>
<p>— 廖茂如</p>
<p>我們不贊成取消文理分科、並不是輕視數理要知道打數理的根底在使初中學生經過嚴格的訓練初中的數理功課敎得好稍有數理天才的學生、自會向數理路上跑就是天才稍遜的學生你把數理的敎材减輕些慢慢的敎導他們他們也可以盡力追隨、這纔是各取所需、各監所能的辦法、　幹那裏會行呢、</p>
<p>現在不談本國且看看外國的情形如何中學分科、可說是各國普遍的現象不過美國是在同一學校内分出許多課程歐洲各國是在同程度的學校内分列許多課程、來連應個别需要方法雖異原理相同、例如德國有文科中學有文實科中學有實科中學卽量近提議的四種中學、課程也不一致有的注重古代文化、有的注重歐洲各國的比較文化有的注重數理有的注重德國文化的全部良以中學科目、太　豐富、要細大不捐雖上智有所不逮分爲數　課程反可使各種學校都有一中心目的法國素稱保守、對於中學課程、各方爭執很烈、但一九零二年的學制、前期中學分甲乙兩種課程、甲種注重古文學、乙種注重近代文學與科學後期分爲四種課程文理的分别更爲顯著、一九二三年政府雖有復古的傾向命令全國中學在開始四年内進修同樣的課程然第二期分三門、文實依然分得很游楚此復古辦法爲各方所反對於一九二五年重行修改中學前四年和後二年均分甲乙兩組、一方彙顧文雅敎育與實利敎育的利益、一方調和學生興趣與延還分科的衝突、英國的學制最爲複雜然英人崇尙自由所以有許多不同類的學校來　　靑年期的、特别需要、最固定劃一的、莫如日本有人說、政府此次所頒布的課表、大致受日本中學的影響、不知日本的中學名爲五年實僅四年、肄業四年的中學生投考高等學校的很多、所以現行的中學已成爲變相的初中高等學校却等於高中中學雖不分科、高等學校是分科的幷且日本的學制高小輿中學並行也是用許多不同類的學校來適應需要不同的學生這一點與歐洲的學制相彷彿、我國在普通中學校取消分科後、又無他種學校來救濟、情形輿日本大不相同</p>
<p>還有一點我們須知道日本對於敎育的設施非常鄭重、不肯輕易變動他們中學的課程、是經過許多年的嘗試改良、保存到現在並不是貿貿然的採用那一　制度、曾記得作者其次到日本參觀其時文部省正研究中學英文課的敎學法他們先從語音學入手請了專家指導、指定一二個中學負責試騐俟試騐雖有成績、再通令全國的中學仿行、他們的政府對於中學敎學法的一個局部問題、尙須養如許周章至於全部的課程那裏有不經過長時間的研究試騐驟然通令全國學校更改的道理昔穩康問鍾會「何所聞而來、何所見而去」我們也要問敎部民十八的暫行標凖、何以忽然頒布、何以忽然取消、究竟試騐的結果怎樣利弊怎樣會不會新課表實行一年半年後重行推翻敎育是國家大事、如此輕易更張殊令人失望、</p>
<h3>㈢取消學分制選科制太嫌呆板</h3>
<p>初行學分制選科制的時候容有流弊、如㈠課程散漫無系統㈡學生選擇無標準㈢主要科目或致降低然經十餘年之改進、事實上已不生問題、現在忽然恢復舊狀、把十餘年的辛苦經營一筆勾銷、似非行政當局鼓勵學校向前推進的意思我們時常聽見人家說中國的敎育破產了、中國學生的程度、一年不如一年了敎育是否破產、學生的程度是否一年不如一年並無客觀的證據卽云如是也應　查眞實的理由、設法補救不應隱聲附和、把所有責任推在學分制選科制身上、去年九一八事變發生後、全國學生眞能安心讀書的很少、以致今年暑期内投考大學發生困難這能怪選科制學分制嗎全國政治阢　、經濟凋殘、行政當局、社會名流不能表率靑年、以致學潮前仆後起學風墮落這又能怪選科制學分制嗎、美國及歐洲各國都有選科制的辦法、爲什麽我們不聽見他們起來反抗的呼聲、「我國販圖遼闊各地情形互異」、（見敎育部通令）不要說現在敎部頒布固定的課表、不能適合各地情狀和各校需要就是幾十年幾百年後、賢明的敎育行政當局、也不應該抱這種思想、敎部祇能規定大綱、總須留出伸縮餘地要知道中學校可以開設的學程非常之多、敎部决不能將所有重要科目都列在課表内、　列在課表内的科目未見得個個都是最重要時間的分配也未必能恰如其分舉一個例子、這次頒布的課表圖畫列爲高中必修科幷且每週有二小時要是高中學生每週習了二小時圖畫、個個都成爲藝術家、那也很好、無如藝術的天才、是勉强不來的、與其敎多數靑年　意塗鴉何如開設幾種選科、令他們各隨所好選習呢、所以取消學分制選科制、是祇有害處看不到什麽利益、</p>

<p>英格蘭　集西捕·蘭開夏·阿迦爾等之健將而成育門出自阿迦爾勞敦·凯芝·屬謠蘭開夏、馬賽　西捕之新右　、快　凖、全隊人才平均、</p>
<p>蘇格蘭　勃拉特蘭·克勞福·赫雷·傑克四人爲西捕之健將、傑克遜來表演、頗有可　、白克斯德爲西人隊之老將、其於六人皆阿迦爾者故蘇格蘭之實力較勝於英格蘭一　、</p>
<p>葡萄牙　中多馳名海上之老將、如谷斯泰、柯拉沙　、然人材雖佳、疏於練習、　難如意　　猶太　猶太在去年之美國賽中、曾淘汰蘇格蘭、複賽與英格蘭成和避、重賽才失敗故　力本届亦當屬可觀、</p>
<p>俄羅斯　將由沙谷爾隊之健將代表、但實力恐平平、以對中華、所差必還也、</p>

<p>滬江務須努力</p>
<p>昨晚五場興趣甚少</p>
<p>西靑籃球會開賽至今、正値一月、甲組各隊中、竟無一隊不敗者、海賊横行一時、竟突然敗於麥令之手、滬江陣容整齊、奪禁呼聲甚高、不料竟爲南星所挫、而來令雖擊敗海賊、但爲持志吃　、餘者均失敗兩次以上、希望自弱一籌、以目下形勢言、海賊麥令滬江三隊形勢均等、而海賊因比賽較多一塲、暫佔優勝、滬江實力雄厚、如能好自爲之、不難輿海賊麥令一爭鰲頭也、各隊成績如下、</p>

<h3>曁南又勝東華</h3>
<p>東華馮運佑李寗均受傷</p>
<p>曁南離塲復賽禍起罰球</p>
<p>東華曁南昨日會師棒球塲、作西聯甲組賽、曁南以三對二反敗爲勝中間曁南曾以罰十二碼之故、麟塲數分鐘、卒受勸入場、重行開戰、終至完場而散爲不幸中之大幸、裁判勃拉脫、</p>
<p>曁南隊</p>
<p>劉祖侃</p>
<p>顧尙動　梁樹棠　陳鎭和</p>

<p>曹秋亭</p>
<h3>裁判多事引起糾紛</h3>
<p>東華曁南、人才相等、勁旅重逢精彩必多、開賽之初、相見以道、觀者色然喜、以爲天下從此無事矣、迨至三十分鐘時、江善　敬李義臣在罰　區域内互冲裁判員多事、十一碼處擲地再踼、人影混亂、陳鎭和　指撞入罰十二碼、曁南全隊離塲、受勸復入、但已失去兩球、此後行動、受怒氣支配、不克自持、令人爲之惋惜、</p>
<h3>表演精美何必粗野</h3>
<p>開場東華一氣呵成前進後繼、極有可觀、上半時之前三十分鐘、更精彩奪目、迨至後來、因來對方規外壓迫、退縮引避　、免受損傷、遂無甚表　、下半時東華泰極否來、馮運佑目眩出場、李寗扶傷應戰、滿目荆棘、欲適何從、彼時曁南掩有全場、攻守俱厲、設能舉動文明、洵屬得意之作、何乃野性難收、犯規不一、雖得最後勝利、亦覺美中不足</p>
<h3>一陣巨風捲入門内</h3>
<p>東華得風𦔳力、首取攻勢因踼任意球之便、撲進陣内、江善敬救球成角、曹秋亭踼來頗佳、中途陳洪光反脚一挑射向門去、謝全和早知此著、從容出險、曁南陳鎭和迎頭而來、東華陣線搖動周賢言御駕親出、風靜浪平、曁南又遭壓迫萬象華攻門未得、轉成角球、踼出場中、由陳洪光再度入萬氏、向門射去、一陣巨風、捲入門内、如是奇觀、驚倒全場觀衆</p>
<h3>罰十二碼從此多事</h3>
<p>曁南迎日對風天然處於被攻地位、陳隊長靈樓觸動、改換陣線加重内部實力、昆仲互換位置、斯時萬象華以迅雷不及掩耳之脚頭猝然攻門相差寸許、否則殆矣隨後曁南衝入空城、球自左移右、梅洪寳舉足將罰周賢言倒地阻之、球遂反趨、於是曁南罰球區内發生江李相衝之事隨以被罰十二碼、曁南離塲復入、損失第二球太平世界從此多事、不五分鐘梅洪寳接得陳氏之球轉挑左方、彼時周賢言李寗羣集一處、左方空虚、新將張鴻藻迎一頭落入門内、不久上半時千終、東華二對一占先、</p>
<h3>兩球連中東華失敗</h3>
<p>二隊換地再戰、境况不同、形勢乃異、曁南雖一對二落後實富有朝氣、開始猛攻不遺餘力、東華前鋒、退縮引避、惟萬象華獨　探險李義臣偶然得球、被困陣中、無路可覓、反趨東華、周賢言撲地一滾、轉身抛出、驚風駭浪、層出不已、李寗腿傷出塲、休息復入實力大减、不久馮運佑目眩退場、内部震動、陳鎭和改爲前鋒大舉攻擊周賢言救球倒地、張鴻藻冲至、踼入門内造成和數、不二分鐘、李義臣踼任意球、離門二十碼、直取　門、觸上柱彈回、陳洪光繼射、謝氏雙手接得、曁南整師又來周賢言救心切、離關過遠、梅氏一脚、欲返不及、反以二對三失敗嗣後東華依然在包圍中謀出路、終難加頤以償償、結果、西聯甲組賽中、東華以二對三、遭第一次失敗、</p>
<h3>不幸事件竟又重見</h3>
<p>開賽之前、曁南敎練余衡之、曾以友誼關係、邀集雙方球員、開誠佈公將以前種種、譬如昨日死、願從新結合友誼、不度因裁判多事引起其竭、而曁南離塲之舉、深予外人惡劣之印象、而動作又屢見粗野、大非適宜、總之、昨日發生不幸事件、謂爲裁判員過於吹毛求疪、不無理由、比賽結果、成立無疑、惟將來結局有無弦遷須俟西人會執行委員會議决之、</p>

<h3>足球戰術的研究（三）</h3>
<p>爲吧城羣力隊首次受挫而作</p>
<p>大凡對足球稍懂些門徑的人們、誰也知道一隊的成敗、是在乎全隊整個方面、能否合作而定單個的表演、是有損無益的、單則易拆、衆則難摧、這個論調確是千古不易的成見不　虹隊員是結合一隊的主角、由多數單個的團結、然後才能產生一個的整個我以爲如要整個方面有進步、非得先從單個方面入手不爲功、因爲單個方面的措施純熟了、便容易產生小部份的聯絡、由小部份的瞭解、便進一步而造成整　個的合作功能、否則、如果單個沒有控摐皮球的本能和比賽場中的智慧就使你整個上胸有成竹和鋪排了很妙的戰、也會心有餘而力不足地、終歸不能頒施而淪於失敗、所以、要羣力此後全隊上改進、非得由隊員方面、先謀進步不可贏可惜的是個人的進境、也非一朝一夕便收奇效、我們對最近的將來未了的錦標賽還多着、我們治標上不能不有一種步驟來暫時應付、然後才徐圖根本上的治療和改進、</p>
<p>阿里非日前旣用那中路堵塞防衛法、來鉗制我們而建奇功、那末、我相信此後其他的隊伍也必舊例可循地施用同樣的戰毠和陣法、來對付羣力、因此、我們未雨綢繆、應該及早設法來準備、勿再蹈上番的覆轍下次逢著這種情狀照樣發生時、我們非多用誘敵離位法、Drawyouropponentsoutofposition及用散漫進攻法、多從兩翼進展來破敵不可、敵人仍要侬樣葫蘆的監視我和亞戴、那便讓他們監視、最妙的辦法、是應由其他的隊友設法從兩旁進取、完完全全把我和亞戴兩人忘却、不可常思以球交來、此種暫忘不理法TemporaryStarvation是用以後亂敵方的宗旨和蒙蔽他們的心理、一俟敵人防禦稍爲弛懈時便出其不意地、覓機　交我倆、則奏功較爲易易、如果遇著敵方抵死不肯疎散有寸步放鬆、、那末、我和亞戴無可奈何地、祇好幹我們的分力工作、其餘的便要想法子來謀勝了、這樣一來、我們便應該佔盡便宜、因爲敵人要監視我倆、非得有兩人以上的實力是無濟於事的、　如敵方用三人來監視我們兩人、照减數一算、每隊十一人、豈非是我方九人門他的八人嗎、九個人的力量、就假使一對一的實力是平均而言、照道理是應該起以戰勝八人的了、還有中衛線爲全隊進退之關鍵、攻守之　鈕、一除成敗、利賴實多所以中衛線切不可與前鋒距離過遠、遇前鋒進攻時、必須隨同前進、從包抄方面做功夫、以便敵之後防解圍時、重復兜截再攻、同時後衛也須步步爲營、以免有首尾不能呼應之弊、（各界如非健忘、想還記得第一次樂華的南征罷、那時我們又何嘗不是多數衆著中路進取而常遭阻塞、那時樂華的兩翼又何嘗不是像現在羣力隊一樣的中　人材、但樂華之能戰職皆勝、乃由中衛線相輔進取的功力、中衛線之强弱、對一隊關係之重輕、誠有不可思議之握要）、此外如我們的遠　LongSwingingPassing及速傳FirstTimePassing、大家　欠工夫、（羣力的短兵相擠、聯絡上還過得去、但遠傳進取較易、一隊必須具此兩覆法則、徒持一法、殊非萬全我們總很的看見能像　南華般用大刀闊斧來陷陣）、蹴球時也常犯過高過遠的毛病、過高則費時又難接納、（上乘球隊極少蹴出高逾十尺之球、余曾於捷克球隊中見之、球來球往、速率上比較此地的增加一倍有强）、過遠則徒使前鋒們空跑無功、OverkickingMeansOverrunningyourOwnForwards兩者均非適宜、大家努力改進罷、照以上所講的步驟施行、我雖不敢担係我們今後戰　不勝、但我敢肯定我們必有比日前較佳較有法則的表演、發現於觀衆的眼廉　、</p>

<h3>烚赤加八兩半</h3>
<p>昨日烚赤仍照加八兩半、交易不多、計楊慶和福記及裘天寳售與盈豐恒同豐永等約共三百兩左右、</p>
<h3>未掉妥者四千餘</h3>
<p>所有十二月份至正月份標金掉期、空方恒興向盈豐恒掉過、由多方貼出五錢乃因烚赤做小之故、（烚赤價照加十兩則掉期約可平掉）正月份至二月份大致平掉其間有七條成交價爲多方貼出二錢、一般多頭祇愿平掉而空頭則以現貨存底增多、均想貼進以致未曾掉妥者尙有四千以上、</p>
<h3>一週中過程俏極</h3>
<p>查此週中市况復反高翔惟變化甚劇、一月份於週初最小價爲七百九十六兩六錢、迨週五（十六日）適逢掉期、惟兩月價同、最大曾出現空前未有八百十九兩八錢之新高峯、全週以一月份共有二十三兩二錢廻顧統核一二月掉價扯平、比諸上週六復漲七兩四錢、</p>
<h3>匯市英緊美鬆</h3>
<p>昨銀市仍以英縮（已連跌一週之久）美平、私電未更、遠期微升一毫、而滙兌亦迭升六七天、昨漲二分三七五至八一二五、至於滬市匯票稍形　異、匯豐掛牌美金放長二五、餘如法和德等均亦跟長、英印港坡等均無變化、殆内盤亦由匯兌關係、故英緊美鬆也、計英金初堅後平、終則比上日縮零六二五、美金晨平繼鬆、午刻復平、統核略長零六二五、至金價過程平平、結果稍遜一兩餘、而各銀行交易不寂、計英金約有十餘萬鎊、各號大致抛出、孟買電進一月份、又美金計四五十萬元金業中依然售出、銀行如華比及老花旗等賡續吸進、美銀公司買進三月份、後市因逢週六無市、</p>

<h3>週末金融市仍靜</h3>
<p>昨値星期六、銀錢業市氣、照例淸閑洋交雖不寂寞、但對於現洋及洋欵交易不暢、祇鈔票因有漢口去胃、約有二三百萬用途、故市上買賣及銀行方面、搜羅頗爲忙碌、銀欵與輔幣情形始終未有若何好象、銅元雖見放長、大都仍屬盤旋而已、</p>
<p>（厘價勿動銀拆又小）「洋厘」早午兩市厘價均與前日午市毫無軒輊爲七錢一分四厘、而競爭狀况、甚爲激烈、不過買賣力量、各不相讓是以形勢終屬平穩、「銀拆」早午兩市統開二分、劃頭加水亦爲白劃、然中途做過二三分、銀根近狀、據業中眼光看去、恐年内無轉機之望矣、</p>
<p>（角洋遞高銅元放長）江南小洋早市爲六錢二分六厘、較前午改小半厘、交易九千角、午市忽又高漲一厘、爲六錢二分七厘、交易一萬二千角、廣東小洋早市及午市均爲六錢二分一厘半、較前午復昂六毫二忽半、交易早市十二萬五千角、午市一萬五千角、銅元又放長一千三百文、爲三百九十六千文、交易四萬一千一百餘串文、</p>
<p>（銀洋交易收解俱寂）「銀欵」是日以週末下午銀行休業、收解較爲零落、華商收解欵票一百五六十萬、外商收解票欵一百三四十萬、特欵收解二百二三十萬墊欵一百萬、結欵一百五十餘萬、各種貨匯稅雜諸欵收解七百十餘萬、押欵交易一百餘萬、出倉八十萬、錢莊銀公單收解二千六百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百二十餘萬、各路匯欵七十餘萬、收現五十餘萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵早市做出六十一萬、午市做出五十六萬鈔票交易早市八萬五千、午市十二萬、場外鈔票早市十八萬五千、午市念一萬、支單交易早市七萬曝午市四萬五千、銀行買賣早市互市八十萬、午市互市四十萬、各銀行洋戶往來收解一百二十餘萬、鈔票收回五十餘萬、發出二百三十餘萬、客路裝去鈔票二三百萬、袁幣六十萬、洋押欵交易六十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解七百七十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百四十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出一百九十餘萬、小錢莊交易六十餘萬、</p>
<h3>年關貨欵互相歸納</h3>
<p>昨聞銀錢業忽然購買鈔票甚殷、而銀行方面裝出鈔票亦甚浩緊、經調查所得、係往漢口之用、蓋此項鈔票、純　中央·中國·四明·興業·等鈔票、爲流通漢埠市面及彙解年關貨欵之用、所以本埠現洋市面、仍無若何舉動耳、</p>
<p>證劵</p>
<h3>金融短期再漲停拍</h3>
<p>│其他跌多漲少│</p>
<p>昨（十七日）華商證劵交易所現市寥落、全日僅有數種開出、成交稀少、期市亦不及前、但重要各債劵仍有相當進出、二十年金融短期有特異變化、因市上頗有需要、而賣出殊稀、其價續漲甚烈、自上午之五十五元漲至五十八元停拍、比前日再漲四元、兩日間漲達八元之鉅、此爲本年所僅見者、惟其他各債劵價趨勢穩定、新買賣不及於前、掉期進出佔多數、故全日盤賡于六七角左右、比前日則以賣方略佔優勢而稍疲、計現貨交易共一萬三千元、内編遣佔一萬元、餘均祇一千元期貨上下午八百四十三萬元、</p>

<h3>在江輪上（二）</h3>
<p>— 侍</p>
<p>但老年人在三思之後，知道這事不是容易辦的，第一，他對於那個人沒有確實的證據；第二，他不能夠明講，因爲老人知道在長江沿岸上動手的人，都是有着同伴的，</p>
<p>第二天江輪上和江水一樣地平靜無事。</p>
<p>老年人更留心地觀察着那個中年人的舉動，曾藉着機會到鄰房裏和那個靑年去談話，但他所能講的只是普通囑咐的話，不能使那個靑年完全理解他的意思。</p>
<p>這一夜，老人仍是不能沈睡，終夜只靜靜地聽着隣房的響聲，但一切都好像平靜的。</p>
<p>第三天，船上的客人仍是完全健康地活在世上。</p>
<p>所以第三日的夜裏，老人倒比較地安下心來，因爲第四日的早晨十點鐘，輪船便可以到達碼頭了。　睡在床上想：</p>
<p>「也許會沒有事了吧，落了船我就可以脫掉這良心上的責任，再有什麽事發生，我也無從知道了。」</p>
<p>老人昏昏地睡到四五點鐘的時候，突然驚醒了。老人自己也不明白爲什麽，只覺得毛骨悚然，心在戰慄着，他留心地一聽，好像聽見在隣房裏有刷刷的動作聲，可是停了一會兒，一切又都靜寂了，只有那輪船行在江水上的機輪聲。老人渾身冰冷而且僵直了，想動也不能一動，就好像有睡魔壓在他的身上。</p>
<p>呼吸緊促着，老人靜候到天明，船上起了紛擾聲，許多旅客已經起身預備落船了。老人壯着膽從床上爬起。跑到隣房的門口，猶豫着，最後敲了敲門，屋裏好像是響着帮意作出的鼻息聲。屋裏有人打開了門，是那個中年人。老人看了看屋裏，一點可欵的痕跡都沒有，只是不見了那個靑年。老人，勉强支持着那要發抖的四肢，但仍靜靜地說：</p>
<p>「我來看看那個靑年，他昨天託我今日帮他落船的。」</p>
<p>「他剛剛到上邊去，他已經和我說好我們一同落棧了，請你老人家不要再費心吧。」那個中年人從容地回答。</p>
<p>老人答應着走開了，他仍然惦念着那靑年，到船上的各處尋找他，但尋不到他的影子。老人想：</p>
<p>「那個靑年恐怕仍是靜靜地臥在那房裏吧，只是怕已經沒有了氣息。」</p>
<p>老人，在恐懼之上又感到了一種興奪，他對於這事沒有絕對地判斷力，可是他非常信任着自己的判斷。他走到船上管事人的房裏，見了一個穿着制服的職員，他對他說：</p>
<h3>繙繹之難</h3>
<p>— 林語堂</p>
<p>繙譯理論，向來有『直譯』與『意譯』兩派，多有很好的理由，使在學繙譯的人，莫知適從。怎麽呌做直譯意譯，頗令人難懂。大槪直譯意思是信筆『直書』。譬如英文一句平常會話Howdoyoudo?Iamverywell,thankyouvorymuch，直譯出來就是</p>
<p>某先生：你怎麽做呢？</p>
<p>某女士：我是很好。謝謝你很多。</p>
<p>又如Theywallkedarminarm直譯出來，應該是：他們走着臂中臂。這樣譯法，我覺得非常忠實，却未免太歐化了。</p>
<p>所以我不大相信直譯，而主張另外一種譯法。這種譯法，是不是就是人家所謂『意譯』，也不必去管他。要緊是看定原文所指爲何物，把中文相當的語字翻譯出來。譬如西洋所謂FirstFloor明明是說二樓，中文只好譯爲二樓了。又如Ihavethrcebrothers只好譯爲『我們弟兄四個』。</p>
<p>不過這種譯法，也頗困難。在物質具體的名稱，還容易。在抽象觀念就常要發生疑難。譬如西報載某處開會五百餘人，中文譯出來·假如譯爲五百餘人，讀者必得到五六十人之印象，所以應該譯爲『赴會者三千人』，讀者才會得『也許有四五百人到會』之印象。又如邀約時間『準七時』應當譯爲『下午五時半』，這樣大家到會必定得到『準七時』之效果。這是屢試屢騐的事。</p>
<p>由中文譯成西文更應該加以詳細考慮，才會一失眞義。譬如中國中學畢業生到柏林念書，文憑一拿出，便入大學，就是因爲『中學』二字誤譯爲MiddleSchool之故，而德人以爲MiddleSchool便是相等於德國之Gynasium，於是中國中學畢業生就太佔便宜了。</p>
<p>此外，我還想到幾條例，可供參考：</p>
<p>中國『火車』應該譯爲西文之Wheelbarrow。</p>
<p>武人汽車，常有護兵站崗，不大好譯，tank或者可用。</p>
<p>『大學校長』可以譯爲Shroff（即洋行買辦僱用之路街收賬人）</p>
<p>『小酌』應譯爲BigPeast，而西文之Dinner也只好譯爲『小酌』。</p>
<p>『妻』可譯爲Housekeeper；『妾』可譯爲lover；家庭可譯爲hotel或是Boardingbouse。</p>
<p>『滑稽』可譯爲Tryingtobefunny。</p>
<p>這不過隨舉幾條例，餘可類推，</p>
<h3>送喪途中</h3>
<p>— 趙家璧</p>
<p>車開的前一刻，一陣雜亂的聲音從車廂口擁進了門，接着有三個女的二個男的揀了近窗的座位，撥開了人家的衣角用力的插坐下來　這一羣人裝束的隨便，像是從家裏趕出門來顧不到去修飾似的，而每個人的臉上，都帶了一層極度悲哀已罩上了自己命運的黑雲；在女的眼角邊·遺留着成條的淚痕，較年老的臉上，在她紅腫的眼皮裏，還飽含着重量的淚水。他們是被人羣的擁擠和趕着上車的心理暫時佔據去心底的悲痛，到站長的口笛聲刺入乘客耳鼓時，各人才記起這次旅行的使命，在大家追述死在杭州患着肺疾的弟弟生前怎樣希望着他的家人們等他病好了可以一塊兒去遊湖·如今媽媽兄姊都趕不及去送他疾終的悲哀，老婦人第一個哭出了聲，其餘的也跟着在　歔中把手帕掩住了口，在每個人的心間，都覺得自己已面對着「死」的壓迫而生命的價値，也無從估計起了。</p>
<p>車過了嘉興，車廂裏已逐漸的靜下來，衝破靜默的祇有成韻的輪子滾在鐵軌上的聲音。搭車的人各自仰着頭在做各自的夢，這一羣送喪的人，因而也不必如先前般用臂部的一端去求身體的均勢，而很舒適的安坐着，心靈上過着另一種的生活了。有二位倚着窗口爭望着車外飛過的村莊山影，因爲這二位年輕的女子好久沒有在這條路上旅行，因而靑草裏的羔羊，水池中的哇鳴，對於她們都特别的感到生趣。她們的面部，大家斜對着車窗，等候着窗外有新奇事物掠過時，好第一個轉臉去欣賞。在車輪聲外，猶可以隱約聽到她倆爭着叙述過去淸明那夜遊湖的往事，在廻憶中，記起在月光裏偷偷的倚在情人肩上的樂境，閉着眼，猶感覺到一陣「生」的陶醉。坐在對面椅上的她倆的哥哥，雖然也面向着窗口，却把報紙遮住了臉。他們是在本埠增刋裏，享受着幻想間都市生活的歡躍：擺動着的曲線：高飛的狐步，嘉寳的粗聲音。耳邊送進來的有韻的輪軌聲，便本能的使他們的脚尖，默按着華茲的拍調，「生」的歡躍，主佔了全心靈，他們也把一切的悲哀，抛在遺忘之鄕了。剩餘的那位年老的婦人把頭兒倚着她女兒的背部，在低垂着跟了車的振動而上下的搖擺；眼皮雖是同樣的紅腫，但是已沉沉的入睡。她雖不能如靑年人般的善於遺忘，確在睡眠的無知覺的一刻裏，同樣擺脫了「死」的壓迫。</p>
<p>車輪不停的前進着，帶了的是五個去送葬的靈魂，他們開始是被死　嚇得沒有勇氣去面對着「生」，但是時間克服了感情，「生」的願望，終於佔據着整個的天地上帝在給予人類各種的德性以外，善忘使人類從極度的悲哀裏重獲到平衡了。</p>
<p>車兒向前進，人類活躍的生命，就靠了這「善忘」的本性，延繞到無盡的將來！</p>
<h3>澳洲土人之奇聞（二）</h3>
<p>— 維翰</p>
<p>庫爾乃土人在公衆面前行了這種儀式之後，那新來者照例非蟄居草木叢中數月不可。在這期間，他們受着看守他們的苦行的人的監視·做這樣那樣的工作·藉以磨練克己之心。一般講來，他們很不願意讓人看見這樣的秘事；因此要看到是很不容易。因此這種儀式是像有着很深刻的道德的效果。當苦行時期將滿的時候·便有人出去報信·　時候便有好幾百人聚到這神聖的地方來。苦行者過了長時候的孤獨生活·這時候乃得加入大衆夥中；因此他是受着非常的刺激·在感情方面也有意氣衝天之槪·而許多羣衆，則圍着苦行者很起勁地跳舞唱歌。</p>
<p>這時候那新來者便要受那道德方面和宗敎方面的敎訓。那敎訓便是：勿任性；自己得了東西，也須分配給朋友；須和平地過活：須把男女關係看得非常嚴重；絕對勿吃那被禁止的東西；須聽年長者的忠告，須絕對服從他們的話。還有，在我們上面，存在着全智全能的</p>
<h3>憔悴的絃聲</h3>
<p>— 葉鷄鳳</p>
<p>每天，每天，她總從我的樓下走過。</p>
<p>每天，每天，我總在樓上望着她從我的樓下走過。</p>
<p>啞默的黃昏，慘白的街燈，黑的樹影中流動着新秋的凉意。</p>
<p>在新秋傍晚動人鄕思的凉意中，她的三絃的哀音便像晚來無巢可歸的鳥兒一般，在黃昏沉寂的空氣裏徘徊着。</p>
<p>沒有曲譜，也沒有歌聲伴着，更不是洋洋灑灑的長奏，祇是斷斷續續信手撥來的絃響，然而在這零碎的絃聲中，似乎不自已的流露出了無限的哀韻。</p>
<p>灰白的上衣，黑的褲，頭髮與面部分不淸的糢糊的一團，曳着街燈從樹𨻶投下長長的一條沉重的黑影，慢慢的在路的轉角消滅。似乎不是在走，是在機械一般的慢慢的移動。</p>
<p>人影消滅在路角的黑暗中，斷續的絃聲還在黃昏沉寂的空氣裏殘留着。</p>
<p>遙想在二十年，或許三十年以前，今日街頭流落的人兒或許正是一位顚倒衆生的麗姝，但是無情的年華，聽着生的輪轉，毫不吝嗇的凋剝了這造物的傑作，逝水東流，絃聲或仍是昔日的絃聲，但是撥絃的手决不是昔日的纎手了。</p>
<p>黃昏裏，倚在悄靜的樓頭，從凌亂的絃聲中，望着她蠕動的黑影，我禁不住易了曇華易散的憐惜。</p>
<p>每天，每天，她這樣的從我的樓下走過。</p>
<p>每天，每天，我這樣的望着她從我的樓下走過。</p>
<p>幾日的秋雨，遊子的樓頭更增加了鄕思的惆悵。小睡起來，黃昏中望着雨中的街道，燈影依然，祇是低濕的空氣中不再有她的絃響。</p>
<p>雨晴後的第一晚，幾片秋風吹下的落葉還濕黏在斜堦上不曾飛起睡街燈次第亮了以後，我寂寞的倚在窗口上，我知道小别幾日的絃聲，今晚在樹陰中一定又可以相逢了。</p>
<p>但是樹陰中的夜色漸漸加濃，街旁的積水反映着天上的秋星，慘白的街燈下，車聲沉寂了以後，我始終不曾再見有那一條沉重的黑影移過。</p>
<p>雨晴後的第二晚，絃聲的消寂仍是依然。</p>
<p>秋風中的落葉日漸增多，傍晚倚了樓頭，當着蕭瑟的新寒，我於鄕懷之外不禁又添了一重無名的綣念。</p>
<p>這幾日的秋風更烈，窗外的兩顆樹　有幾處已露出了光脫的秃幹。旁晚的街燈下，沙沙的祇有繽紛的落葉，她的絃聲是從不曾再聽見過了。</p>
<p>秋光老了，憔悴的絃聲大約也隨着這憔悴的秋光一同老去了。我這樣喟然嘆着。</p>
<p>每天，每天，我仍是這樣的倚在我的樓上。</p>
<p>每天，每天，我不再見她從我的樓下走過。</p>
<p>神，他能使天下雨，使萬物蘇甦，而他的聲音便是雷鳴，平日須竭力討神的歡心，不然死後便不能昇天。他們土人們，是深信着實際的儀式能生出神秘且最上的效果的。當孩子行完儀式走出叢林之後，他最先想的事，便是娶妻。</p>
<p>澳洲土人之間是沒有「父親」這個字的：他們把父親和伯叔喚做「烏加培利」，把母親和姨母喚做「卡卡」。因爲在昔這種種族之間沒有個人的結婚制度，所有的男子都是所有的女人的共通的丈夫：而這種稱呼也許就是這所謂雜婚時代的遺物。這種雜婚制度，現在已經廢去了。在現在結婚雖是自由的，但是第一代表親（如表兄和表妹）之間，却不能結婚：至於第二代表親，就不要緊了。</p>
<p>在擇妻上，各人所受的種族間的規約有種種，而其中最簡單的則是庫爾乃土人。他們　種族分五派，一派分十九黨·黨乃散在各處的羣的集合，一羣有　家族，一個老人和兒孫一同過着活。擇妻的時候，是絕對不許血族結婚的，並且各人不能與自己黨内的人結婚，必須要擇他黨的人，即所謂異族結婚。</p>

<h3>時代与愛的歧路十八</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>你替我拿到我的房裏去好了。</p>
<p>他說着便從曾家的後門走出來。在路上還在希望鶴子夫人能夠看見這張卡片。</p>
<p>「眞是莫明其妙。鶴子夫人何以和那個老日本鬼那樣地要好得來。莫非是她的情人麽？聽說日本男女的戀愛，歲數相差十年二十年，並不爲奇的。」</p>
<p>爲這件事，他今天像始終不能安心了。他想，今天無心聽講義了。他不單在心裏感着一種不安，並且還感着一種並無名義的悲楚。</p>
<p>「今天是十二月二號，任家請酒是五號，還差四天。若是在今晚上就好了，可以遲些回去。我眞不願意看見那個鶴子夫人了！不，我是不願意看見那些東洋鬼！」</p>
<p>他愈想愈憤激，也愈覺痛心。坐在三等電車裏，眞想流眼涙了。</p>
<p>「假如眞個爲這位東洋女人而流淚，那末自己的眼涙未免太廉價了！」</p>
<p>理性和感情在他胸口交戰了一會，無軌電車在終點停住了。</p>
<p>跳下了電車，又爲步行或呌黃包車的問題躊躇了一會。他覺得自己的人生觀和昨天的有點不一樣了。昨天，他雖然對世界有點悲觀，但仍抱持着堅苦勤儉，努力做人的宗旨。到了今天，丨看見那個老東洋鬼之後，丨他的舊的人生觀忽然起了動搖，對於世間一切的一切，都灰心了，灰到和他酓天的臉色那樣的灰白。一想到鶴子夫人，便恨得咬牙切齒，連忙搖頭。但有時又想把花月痕裏韓荷生所作的「搔首蒼茫欲問天」一類的詩抄了一大團下來，送給鶴子夫人讀。她讀了之後，如果「眼波盈盈竟吊下數點淚來」，那末，才消我這口氣。</p>
<p>「她是東洋女子，怎麽懂得漢詩！豈不是對牛彈琴麽？」</p>
<p>想到這點，他的心又冰冷了。</p>
<p>一羣黃包車夫把他圍住了。</p>
<p>「要車吧？」</p>
<p>「到××大學去，要車麽？」</p>
<p>他無意識地跳上一部黃包車上，坐下來了。</p>
<p>「算了吧。人生有什麽意義啊！何必爲省一角半角的車錢去走路，走得自己雙腿發酸，喘氣不過來。我要改變我的舊的人生觀了。」</p>
<p>他留心一看，也有三三五五的同學和敎員，都各坐上一部黃包車，冒着冷風，馳向大學這邊來。</p>
<p>海泉下了黃包車，才踏進外大門，便聽見鏗鏗的一陣上課的鐘聲。他趕忙走向敎室裏來。今天第一堂是王敎授的微分學，他是有名的早上課堂的先生。海泉走到敎室門首，看見有二三位同級生還立在敎室外的廊下，知道王敎授還沒有來，才安心了。</p>

<p>業餘漫譚</p>
<h3>憂懼和苦悶的心理</h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>在上期漫談裏，我們因感奮於一般生活環境的惡劣，想從積極的方面，尋找一條出路來，打破這苦悶的現狀，我們以爲大家所受的壓迫旣是相同，那麽這種壓迫的解放，自然不是一二人的努力所能成功，因此曾建議我們應先從有組織的研究入手，討論各種需要共同努力改造的方策，稍有結果，就可隨時作實行的嘗試。但近五六日以來，又接到許多讀者的來信，一方面雖是承認志同道合的店員學徒們·應有聯絡的必要，而另方面，則仍覺這種毫無把握的結合前途，殊覺是十二分的暗淡，字裏行間，是充滿了憂懼和苦悶的音調，這種憂悶的心理·是太重要了，極有鄭重提出來討論的必要。</p>
<p>我們應深切的明白，在這種外敵巳升堂入室，而國内政治，仍是異常混亂·人民生計貧困萬分的現狀之下，所謂憂懼，所謂苦悶，實爲一種自然的結果，本是稍有思想的靑年，所應有的一種觀感，不然，那又與一班醉生夢死，對國家民族的存亡，毫無感覺的，去過混世蟲生活的人們有什麽分别呢？但，我們應認識憂悶是與悲觀不同的，悲觀是灰心喪志的結果，憂悶則由於不滿現狀而生，是潛伏着尋找出路的意識的，所以憂悶也可說是改造現狀的先鋒，每一次現狀的改進，均可說爲每一次憂悶後所努力找出來的結果，也就是憂悶後。一種眞正的無上快樂。不過我們要切實注意的，就是一般的人，在憂懼和苦悶以後，反往往極容易走入悲觀，腐化，不振作的路上去而在憂悶之後，所能積極奮鬥，不入消極頽唐的途境者，則非有相當智識與毅力的素養的人不能做到。</p>
<p>所以在這裏，我們要認淸楚，解决憂悶的大道，是智識的追求與奮鬥精神的培養。要努力方能達到，憂悶的問題愈廣，愈複雜，則其所需要的智識也愈多，進步也愈慢，應有堅忍的毅力，集合同志·協力而爲之，所謂「有志竟成」，方有解决此憂悶的一日，經過多少困難而後成功的事，其快樂自也非常之大了·</p>
<p>我們在憂悶的時候，所最要防備的危險，就是不走智識追求的路，而爲環境所屈伏，懶於奮鬥，苟安一時，直到意志消沉，灰心喪氣，隨流合汚而後止，這是我們無論努力於個人生活的改進或擴大到社社上一種公共事業的革新工作都應當深切注意的一點·</p>
<p>最後：我們覺得，我們現在的憂悶，尙多半屬於個人的出路，大部份要先靠我們自身的努力，雖然有人說，這許多個人的出路，是由於這整個社會，國家以至於全世界的現狀所造成，但個人是社會的基礎，是社社的大海裏的一個支流，若個人自身問題猶不能先由自己的努力求得相當的解决，試問將來憑什麽經騐·學養·精神去做更大的改革社會的工作呢？</p>
<p>問題討論</p>
<h3>店員爲什麽要怠慢顧客</h3>
<p>— 游萍</p>
<p>店員慢客問題</p>
<p>無論都市或鄕間的人們，假使出外買物回來的時候，怕是常要指斥一般店員的招待不周吧。其實若用公平的眼光把店員慢客的事分析起來，我們就不能單方面的責備他們，應該認爲是現在資本制度下的一種反應。因爲促成怠慢的動機，一部分固然是他們沒有受過髙尙的敎育，充分的修養所致：但是資方亦不能輕辭其咎。他們爲了沒有勇氣和力量，反抗上層的高壓力，於是只得採用非武力抵抗主義的方法，把含蓄着的忿怒向顧主們發洩，來减損店方的營業。</p>
<p>本來，一個純潔的靑年，誰不想做個有爲而受人尊敬的人物：只因環境太惡劣了，不得不强使他們走入被指斥的路。他們爲了生活的驅策，抛棄了學校，把整個的身心，賣給資方，供奴隷式的驅使，來博得蠅頭的薪水，維持他們和他們家庭的生計，你想·這已是多麽可憐的事丨但是資本家還不諒，更横加摧殘，任意延長工作的時間，剝奪人生應有的娛樂，阻止個人學業的上進：加之周圍環列着的勢利者，睥睨輕視，更使他們根本懷疑了人生的意義，覺得世態的炎凉不定，好像是處在一個旣殘忍而又缺乏同情心的社會裏了。因了這種觀念的濟入腦海，遂致不平之氣發於心而顯現於面部，最後乃造成所謂「怠慢顧客」的事件。</p>
<p>所以我敢武斷的說一句：假使要澈底改變店員的態度，除非提高待遇，改造環境，活躍他們的生命，充實他們的人格。否則，任何的指斥諷嘲，是絕對改變不了他們反常的心理的。不過，在現有的社會制度之下，要圖改造，又談何容易呢？</p>

<h3>改進業餘生活的實騐</h3>
<p>— 歐陽錦屛女士</p>
<p>（商店義務敎師）</p>
<p>兩三年以前，家叔正在杭州，籌辦了一間小規模的茶葉商店。店中一共雇用十七八個夥友，其間學徒却佔了三分之二。說起這十幾個學徒，都是貧苦出身，祇念過兩三本初小國文敎科書，總算略識之無而已。他們雖則是工作低微，然而，好幾個是發憤有爲，希望上進的靑年。祇爲求學有心，學費無着，所以，每天到下午七點鐘，工作完了，惟有手申報一份，看幾則淺近的專電。有時，他們出神起來，一壁看，一壁讀，可是，低級的程度，讀出來免不了錯漏百出。家叔覺其滿口白字，什麽「何應次（欽字的誤讀）到漢口啊！「能（熊字的誤讀」式輝任衛成（戍字的誤讀）司令」啊！在旁聽了，煞是好笑，而安難緘默。因此，家叔組織夜校的動機，就發生了。有一天，他對學徒們說：『你們看報的程度，還談不到，但是，你們喜歡專心一志來補習嗎？我願意每天犧牲兩句鐘，盡一點指導的義務。不過，你們要有恒心才行！』當時沒有一個不贊成。家叔見其向學的殷勤，亦沾沾自喜。因爲店面不大，貨物擁塞之故，便在店址的左鄰，租了一間小小的房間，作爲課室。並在盈餘項下，撥出一部分的紅利，以爲租金，這些紅利，是店夥們情願犧牲而動用的。從此，每晚上課，兩年之内，已修完高小課程。現在每一個學徒，都有初中的學識。讀音固然比從前正確多多；講到珠算，筆算，也出手流利。家叔雖非循循善誘的大學問家，談不到什麽榮譽，然而，至少博得學徒們的熱烈底感激，心裏常常要想圖報；而酬報的唯一方法，就是：對於日中一切大小店務，莫不努力加緊工作，一洗普通商店吃飽飯，習偷閒的流弊！</p>
<p>我以爲上海是通商大埠，幾家自命爲大公司，大商店的低級職工，學識未必十分充足罷。經理先生們對之，曾否準備補救之法？無疑地，自己本人是公務覊身，不暇再來擔任敎務，可是，至少也要聘請一位有經騐的敎員，授職工們以普通技能，誠如英諺說：『有充分的商業學識，才有充分的商業發展！』店主們呀，快實行罷！</p>

<h3>吃豆腐</h3>
<p>— 英惠</p>
<p>事情發生在車間裏。我那時做的掃地的工作，是××紗廠布機間裏的一個小工。廠裡小姊妹眞多，有好幾百。就在我掃地那地方，有個很美麗的小姊妹，才只十六歲。來廠裡做生活，不過兩個號頭。有人呌她做廠花。什麽呌廠花，我先是不明白，後來，才知到，是因爲全廠裏要算她容貌最姣好。說姣好，正因爲姣好，才有這回事。飯桶，領班，大小四個，常是紅着眼，死釘着她，我一看到這情形就生氣，樣子越看越討厭，好像要把她活活地吃下肚裡去。</p>
<p>她名字呌張紅弟，號牌是六十二。</p>
<p>我看出情形有些不對。正好，到後就發覺領班吊膀子。那三個飯桶，心是想，可是地位比領班低，不敢得罪他，就讓他獨個幹。我早就看出有八成，可不是，放工前半個鐘頭，他竟向張紅弟調戲起鶆。從前捉不着他的短處，這回我淸淸楚楚聽到他說那不要臉的話：「小姊妹，累不累？」</p>
<p>他裝笑臉。獻殷勤。小姊妹沒理她，手還在做生活。</p>
<p>「六十二，你聾？」他又說，但小姊妹仍不理他。好，我心裡佩服她。可是，我恨死領班，心裏暗駡：「好體面的王八蛋！」眞哪，他有四十歲，小姊妺才十六，天曉得是什麽一回事。說句不好聽的話，她比他孫女還要小。我生着氣。他简直不是人，不是我寃枉他。人家不理，他還要往前撞，又說：「不說話，啍，裝啥神氣。」</p>
<p>但好小姊妺，又給他釘子撞，我眞快活。　　「放了工，白相白相好不？」</p>
<p>怎樣，正是這回事丨眞是色膽如天我恨不得一拳頭，打他個仰面朝天，向他說：「還敢不敢？」不是人，他連牲口都不如，人堆裡，牲口堆裏能容他嗎？</p>
<p>「不要難爲情，沒啥關係。」他又說。簡直是欺天，這呌什麽話！唉！工廠裡，，眞不是人去的地方，好好一個女子·一做了工，就容易吃歹人的虧。領班，他是多麽的萬惡不赦！</p>
<p>「去！」我聽到小姊妹這一聲很是乾脆有力量。她臉上一臉的氣。十六歲，本是個孩子，那裡受得住這點，我看她眼圈有點紅。傷心，我就想，不知前輩人做了什麽壞事，要報復到她身上去受這樣的罪！她的爹媽，不知道現在還在否？若有爹媽，又知道自己孩子在受欺負，應該怎樣呢？······想到這，領班轉身走到旁邊去，我也就放下這件事，抱着滿肚子的氣繼續掃地，這半天，我不自主的停了工。總算天保佑，沒讓飯桶看到我停下工，否則，怕又要罰兩只洋，至少兩只洋。但我一肚子的氣可怎樣消？我又爲什麽要替人家生氣，多管閒事？丢開罷。不行，丢也丢不下，只是蹲在肚子裡來回的滾着。</p>
<p>不一會，就放工，算是解了我的圍，老天爺，我該消了氣了。不對，事情一點不這樣，拿起飯盒子，走下樓，偏要隱着紅弟身後一叚路走，這好像我預知有什麽事情要發生似的。</p>
<p>事情可是眞巧！！出了廠門，拐一條馬路，遠遠的我就看到那領班站在一個衖口裡。啊，好東西，他等在這裡，心裡定是不懷好意，我要看看，看個究竟。於是我找個地方隱身偷看。旁的工人都一羣一羣往家走。這事情，像有一股電吸着我，我的腿，生生走不開。我心裡的氣，生的更大，氣火往外冒。到這時，我猜到事情終究不會好。唉　！丨丨小姊妺多可憐！容貌長得好，就要受欺負？老天爲什麽不給她生一副醜面孔丨十六歲，才只十六歲的小姑娘，將來日子怎樣過？可惜小姊妹又沒有同伴，只是一個人走着，危險啦　怎麽辦呢？我替她着急。果然，領班攔住她的路。知道又　說話</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>我三脚兩步跑到他後面去。他說：「小姊妺，去白相去。」</p>
<p>「我不去！」小姊妺說完想往前走，他竟拖住她的手。</p>
<p>「小妮子，不去我偏要你去！」他緎嚇她，强拉着她走。小姊妺往外曳。曳也曳不出。我這時，還能袖手旁觀麽？不能，要想法子幫她解圍！我握起拳頭，眞要跳過去貼他一個燒餅，然後，不管三七二十一，打他個半死不活！可是又一想，不行，這一來，我的生活要被停！一開除，怎麽辦，又要吃苦受罪了！不能再想了，他拖她那樣急。「吃豆腐！吃豆腐！吃豆腐！」急得沒法子想，我一連喊三聲。街上工人還有好些，一下子就看到這件事，跑，看，緊緊地把那兩個人圍起來。人，一層又一層，圍的不透風。我也是一個。領班這回放下手。小姊妺哭了，人們亂七八糟地問她，她就把領班吃豆腐事情對大家哭哭啼啼說，說完，像是不知怎樣是好。</p>
<p>「你媽的！」我聽到這樣一句話，接着有東西從後面飛進來，就看到領班臉上患了血，什麽東西打的，也沒看到，沒有人顧到這點，就只看着領班痛快。那領班到這時，也不知怎樣好，逃不出，站不起，手按住臉上流血之處。</p>
<p>「打死他！」</p>
<p>「反對吃豆腐！」</p>
<p>有人這樣喊起來。他這時，一句話也說不出，身上有點抖。眞有人幹，三個小夥子，跳到人羣中，「劈查拍查」一頓打，就聽到他「哎喲，哎喲」呌兩聲，躺到地下了。事情閙大了。三個人，打完就擠出人羣去。沒了，找不到影子。但羣衆仍沒有散，還在看熱閙。接着傳來一陣汽車喇叭聲，巡捕房汽車遠遠開過來。車停人堆前，下來三個華捕。人們自動散開一條路，讓他們走進圈子裡。小姊妺早就不哭，</p>
<p>這時對巡捕講她的事。我看他們怎樣辦。到後，兩個人一同上汽車，到巡捕房去。領班上車時有人服侍，他呻吟着。我看到這裡算鬆了一口氣，倒底惡人有惡報，領班不會好。覺得打的痛快。我說我不是故意來摀領班的蛋，我不喊一下子，心裡實在過不去！一喊就閙出這大事！也好，算救了張紅弟。領班，飯桶，平常總狐假虎威，不好好地敎訓他們一下眞不行！以後，要再吃豆腐也得小心一點。</p>
<p>六十二號小姊妺第二天又來做工。但那領班受了傷，又被拘，廠裡就停了他的生意。</p>

<h3>重作馮婦</h3>
<p>— 芹女士</p>
<p>因爲家境的寒素，所以我在小學畢業的那年，自顧力薄，不敢再存入大學的奢望；就决定了進職業中學，預備將來在社會上謀得相當的工作，以解决生活問題。</p>
<p>果然，職業中學畢業了，職業也找到了。但是在滬戰的影響中，不幸我那服務的公司也淪了戰區，不得已祇得遄返家鄕。可慘啊丨受帝國主義者侵略政策之賜的，不知有幾許人哩？丨</p>
<p>後來停戰恊定簽字，上海的繁榮也漸次恢復。雖然淞滬的血跡尙未乾，但那幾個月前怵目驚心的印象，恐怕祇在少數人的腦子裏盤旋着罷了。失業幾個月的我，已差不多一步一步向窘境走去：所以祇能重作馮婦，再來海上。</p>
<p>挨了極大的面情，噉飯地是找到了。雖覺學非所用，但被麵包問題緊迫着的我，又有何辦法，而不「勉爲其難」呢？</p>
<p>現在工作已有半年了。薪給是不必說，祇就所任的職務而言，只覺得乏味而無意識。一個人對於沒有興趣的事情，是辦不出什麽好的成績來的。所以我想找一個適宜於我的事務。</p>
<p>我所願擔任的，是中英文打字或書記的工作。證之以往的經騐，自信對於上述兩項必可勝任。但是因了乏人介紹，所以祇得學毛遂的自荐，而懇求貴刋給我一個披露的機會。同時如有需用此項人才的洋和地公司或其他機關的來信，希望隨時通知我，無任感謝。</p>

<p>答遺精一症。確爲輕年人之通病。向本刋訊問者。很多。茲爲作一總答復。希患者注意云。</p>
<p>男子於靑春發動期。睾丸之精液漸次充盛。液充則溢。内經有言曰。男子二八而腎氣盛。精氣氣溢。故平時偶一遺精。此不能謂之遺。實精氣盛而骨溢。非病也。現今男子往往一月一遺。以爲此遺精重症。如淹緾日久。必成癆瘵。紛紛來函詢問。不知液充即溢。於身體上絕無關碍。如一月遺洩有二三次或四五次甚者間日即遺者是則眞所謂遺精矣。　考遺精之起齒。據近來函詢觀察十中之七八太半起於手淫。男子至發育時期。其一切思想之追求。偶一崎偏之。即易患此。初患時。於體强力壯之少年。自不覺若何痛苦。久而久之。習爲常事。甚至有每日非手淫一次而不能寐者。渠不知其戕身耗液。無過於此。行之旣久。而後雖至覺悟。則已身罹遺精苦疾矣。手淫日久。精關漸漸不固。陰液内虧。相火易熾。故雖至覺悟。而縱能痛改前非。而依然時時遺洩。不亦苦哉。然亦由因用腦過度。心火下陷入腎而致遺精者。問病函中雖偶有一二。殊不多覯。以上症象。因手淫而遺精者每晨服八味地黃丸三錢鹽湯送下。因心火下陷入腎而致遺精者。每日服六味地黃丸三錢開水送服。如一月一遺者。此謂溢精。無須服藥也。尙有其他有夢無夢者。此因於心腎病根不同之關係。限於篇幅未能一一解答。當另作專篇詳之。</p>

<p>血病叢談</p>
<h3>血症常識（五）</h3>
<p>— 丁·濟·華·</p>
<p>咳血</p>
<p>肺主氣。咳爲氣分之病。故屬於肺。肺又司呼吸。外合皮毛。風寒外襲。皮毛固閉。肺氣不能宣暢。内部爵熱。上薰刺激。肺居五臟之巔。受熱之刑迫過甚。則血絡驟裂。故咳嗽者。咳劇則時或見血。此熱迫使出。乃風寒侵襲而氣機不宣。仲景所謂『咳而喘息有音。甚則吐血者』也。</p>
<p>病溫暑濕熱者。亦能因之而咳血。其症則頭痛身熱。口乾小便不利。狀與外感風寒相似。然此病皆因襲入口鼻之濁邪。浸入脈絡。蘊爵腸胃膜原之間。熱激脈裂。血由背部溢入胃間。胃爲生痰之地。痰隨咳上致成咳血。與外感之因膚表而入臟腑致成咳血者。不可同日語也。</p>
<p>如久咳喘滿而咳血者。肺分受久咳震動。氣促上逆。氣逆則引起諸經之火。胸背絡脈之血。因受震而隨咳咳出。此病高年久咳者往往見之。且每於天寒時尤甚。蓋冬日氣候寒冷。咳逆病根。起於肺分受寒。平時因氣候之調劑。病象尙堪支持。而一遇天寒。肺部吸入之寒與故病相加。其疾自更增重。冬日皮毛緊閉。呼吸以口鼻爲大部分。口鼻吸入之寒。肺分首當其衝。直接感受。故病更加劇。年高氣逆久咳而致見血。於冬日發現者。實難樓計。此症最易錯認外感咳血。醫者誤治。往往釀成虚損癆瘵。愼之愼之。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Third Plenary Session ordered the Party Affairs, Political, Economic, Military, and Education groups to hold review meetings in the morning and afternoon of the 17th. The results were as follows:</p>
<p>(Party Affairs Group) Meetings were held in the morning and afternoon, chaired by Chen Guofu. First, the work reports of the Standing Committee, the Organization, Propaganda, and People's Movement Committees were reviewed. Then, the proposal to improve the organization of the Party Headquarters submitted by Shi Ying and others, and the proposal to reorganize the party implementation plan submitted by Sun Ke and others were reviewed. Some of the content of the two proposals was already being implemented by the Central Government. The remaining articles of the two proposals, which were similar in nature, were sent to the Plenary Session for discussion with separate opinions. The proposal to restore the Mongolian Party Headquarters as soon as possible, submitted by Bai Yunti, was approved in principle, but opinions were added regarding the organizational aspects. The remaining two proposals, one to establish a training class for Mongolian Party and government personnel in the Central Government, and the other to treat repatriated comrades who have been oppressed with preference, were approved in principle.</p>
<p>(Political Group) Meetings were held in the morning and afternoon, chaired by Wu Chaochu. (1) The proposal to strictly prohibit opium, submitted by Fang Juehui and five other committee members, was approved in principle, with attached opinions. A meeting of representatives from various provinces should be convened in Beijing soon to discuss the opium prohibition and submit it to the Plenary Session. (2) The proposal to promote local autonomy, starting with livelihood and education, submitted by Chen Lifu and six other committee members, was deemed to be the same in nature as the local autonomy proposal resolved by the Internal Affairs Conference. After the resolution on local autonomy by the Internal Affairs Conference is incorporated into this proposal, it will be submitted to the Plenary Session for discussion. (3) The proposal to clarify officialdom, submitted by Li Qian, was originally under the supervision of the Central Political Council. It was appended with opinions and will still be strictly discussed by the Central Political Council. (4) The proposal to effectively punish corruption to cultivate integrity and uphold the rule of law, submitted by Shi Ying and eight other committee members, was previously handled by the Central Political Council's Disciplinary Committee for Public Officials, and the Central Government's Disciplinary Committee for Political Affairs Officials will also be established. It was appended with opinions and will still be supervised by the Central Political Council. (5) The proposal to abolish the provincial government committee system and change it to a provincial governor system to facilitate administration, submitted by Shi Ying and seven other committee members, was deemed to be a matter of factual necessity, with added opinions, and submitted to the Plenary Session for discussion. The proposal to establish public opinion organs and reduce the size of provinces, submitted by Wu Chaochu and others, the former had already been resolved at the National Crisis Conference, and the Central Political Council was already drafting regulations. The resolution of the National Crisis Conference and the drafting situation of the Central Political Council should be discussed together. The latter was also approved by a resolution at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third National Congress, and the Central Political Council should be urged to actively design and implement it.</p>
<p>(Economic Group) A meeting was held in the morning, chaired by Song Ziwen. A total of nine proposals were discussed. (1) The proposal to correct the Huai River diversion method, submitted by Bo Wenwei, stated that the Huai River diversion should focus on both the river and the sea, but the three principles proposed by the proposer could be adopted and implemented by the Huai River Diversion Council, so it was approved. (2) The proposal to raise funds to redeem the Jiaoji Railway, submitted by Wang Zhengting, was approved in principle. (3) The proposal to protect the domestic textile industry, submitted by Wu Tiecheng, and the proposal to develop industry, submitted by Wu Chaochu, were both attached with review opinions by the Review Committee. (4) The proposal to increase the bond fund, submitted by Yang Hu, was deemed to have been proceeding smoothly since the Central Government had re-promulgated the repayment method for all debts, and it was difficult to increase allocations given the current financial revenue of the Central Government, so the Review Committee had slightly different opinions on the original proposal. (5) Feng Yuxiang and Ma Chaojun both had proposals to provide relief to rural areas, and Chu Minyi and Liu Shouzhong both had proposals to develop the Northwest. The review results were merged separately and attached with opinions, and submitted to the Plenary Session.</p>
<p>(Education Group) Meetings were held in the morning and afternoon, chaired by Cai Yuanpei. (1) The proposal to reform higher education, submitted by the Central Organization Committee; (2) the proposal to determine education standards and improve the system, submitted by Cheng Tianfang; (3) the proposal to reform the education plan, submitted by Chen Guofu. Because the nature and methods of the three proposals were interrelated, the various committee members first presented and discussed the points that should be researched one by one, and expressed their opinions on the elements of the three proposals themselves. The discussions lasted for more than three hours in the morning and afternoon. As a result of the discussions, the resolutions on education from previous congresses were also added to the research. The Review Committee appointed committee members to extensively cite various key points, with reference to the unique spirit of the country, social needs, and the times, in order to provide a detailed explanation of each proposal, so that the Plenary Session can make a decision.</p>
<p>(Military Group) A meeting was held in the morning, chaired by He Yingqin. (1) The proposal to assist the Northeast Volunteer Army in long-term resistance against Japan, submitted by Zhu Jiqing and twenty-seven other committee members, and the proposal to assist the Volunteer Army and recover lost territory by force, submitted by Feng and nine other committee members, were merged and submitted to the Plenary Session for discussion. (2) The proposal to improve the administrative authority of aviation to develop aviation and consolidate national defense, submitted by Zhang Huichang and nine other committee members, was supplemented with opinions and submitted to the Plenary Session for discussion. (3) The proposal to train Mongolian cavalry, submitted by Bai Yunti and other committee members, will be further discussed with reference to the suggestions and opinions of the Mongolian princes. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Government Denies Sending Troops to Recover Lost Territory</h3>
<p>The Plenary Session Only Submitted the Proposals for Review</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 17th, Chinese and Western newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai reported that Wu Chaochu and other members of the Central Committee proposed that several Western newspapers in Shanghai published in large letters that Song Ziwen and others advocated: (1) The government should quickly assemble heavy troops in Rehe and Hebei to send troops to recover lost territory; (2) The government should use its power to assist the Volunteer Army; (3) The Party and the government should use their power to guide the people to boycott Japanese goods; (4) It is determined that the League of Nations and the United States are unable to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue. Regarding this news, the government's responsible spokesperson expressed an absolute denial that there had been such a resolution in the plenary session on the 16th. The government has not expressed any opinion on this proposal, but there was such a proposal in the meeting, and the leaders only agreed to submit it to the Review Committee for review. Song was yesterday elected as the convener of the Special Foreign Affairs Review Committee, which may be the source of outside misunderstanding. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>The Presidium Will Meet This Morning</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Third Plenary Session will adjourn in the morning and afternoon of the 18th. The Presidium is scheduled to meet on the morning of the 18th to determine the agenda for the second plenary session on the 19th. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

(Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Rural Relief Proposal</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The main points of the rural relief proposal submitted by Feng Yuxiang and others are: more than 80% of our country are farmers. If this vast majority cannot be stabilized, then all facilities cannot be implemented. (1) Abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies; (2) Establish farmers' banks and various cooperatives in various localities; (3) Abolish usury; (4) Eliminate bandits and rectify public security. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Establish a Northwest Labor Relief Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The main points of the proposal to establish a Northwest Labor Relief Committee and specify fundraising methods, submitted by Shao Lizi, are: In the past, there were many abuses in emergency relief, and the results were even less effective. A Northwest Labor Relief Committee should be directly established by the National Government to specify fundraising methods, recruit engineering talents, select those in Shaanxi and Gansu that are suitable for water conservancy and transportation and urgently need to be handled, and implement work-for-relief to save millions of dying victims. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Aviation Development Proposal</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The main points of the proposal to improve the administrative authority of aviation to develop aviation and consolidate national defense, submitted by Zhang Huichang and others, are: (1) The aviation agency should be directly under the Executive Yuan, and the government should grant it independent aviation administrative power; (2) Formulate an organizational law to unify the establishment, and all aviation agencies in various provinces should be subordinate to the Central Government; (3) Determine the budget to seek overall development, and the funds originally used by the provinces to handle aviation must still be designated for the construction of aviation; (4) Formulate a civil aviation law to encourage various provinces to develop civil aviation, in order to seek the development of various cultural, industrial, and transportation undertakings. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Correct the Huai River Diversion Method</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The main points of the proposal to correct the Huai River diversion method, submitted by Bo Wenwei, are: It is a mistake to divert the Huai River into the Yangtze River and through the old course of the Yellow River. The Huai River should be diverted into the sea. The treatment of the Huai River should reduce the water level of Honghu Lake. The diversion of the Huai River and land reclamation must be planned together, and then the funds will be available. The funds will be derived from the benefiting fields, but the government should raise the preparation funds. A Huai River Diversion Bureau and a Huai River Diversion Association should be established, and a Huai River Diversion Bank should also be established. Bo Wenwei also telegraphed the Third Plenary Session to state his proposal opinions. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Reduce the Size of Provinces</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The content of the proposal to implement the reduction of provinces, submitted by Wu Chaochu and others, is that at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third National Congress in the 19th year, it was resolved that the provinces should be re-designated and appropriately reduced, and submitted to the Central Political Council for detailed research.

<h3>Geneva is Full of Pessimistic Atmosphere</h3>
<p>We Believe the Draft Resolution is Not Thorough</p>
<p>Japan Also Expresses Rejection</p>
<p>The Discussion of the Nineteen-Nation Committee is Likely to be Delayed Until Next Spring</p>
<p>(Geneva) Geneva is now filled with a pessimistic atmosphere regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute. It is feared that the draft resolution proposed by the Five-Nation Committee will be delayed for a long time in negotiations, so some parties are quite inclined to wait until after the Christmas and New Year holidays before continuing discussions. The Chinese side believes that this draft resolution does not have a thorough solution, while the Japanese side believes that the current form of the draft resolution is unacceptable. However, it is evident that neither side is likely to take the responsibility of resolutely rejecting it, because rejecting this draft resolution is equivalent to rejecting the mediation procedure, and the League of Nations will adopt the provisions of Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Covenant. The provisions of that section state: "If the dispute cannot be resolved in this way, the Executive Council, by a vote of all or a majority, shall issue a report explaining the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Executive Council deems fair and appropriate." If that is the case, there will be serious consequences, and anyone who thinks about this is deeply worried. Even small countries that have always advocated strict actions are panicked about the possibility of this situation. This afternoon, the Five-Nation Committee met for three hours. It was heard that the Secretary-General and the Chairman of the Nineteen-Nation Committee successively reported the results of their talks with Dr. Yan, the Chinese representative, and Matsuoka, the Japanese representative. Although neither side had received instructions from their governments during the contact, both sides were able to make preliminary recommendations based on the usual instructions they had received. The Committee will meet again tomorrow afternoon, at which time the Chinese and Japanese representatives should have received replies from their governments. It was originally said that the Nineteen-Nation Committee would meet on Monday, but the general impression is that it will be necessary to continue the discussion after Christmas, because both China and Japan will express objections to this proposal. The main points of the original draft submitted to the Chinese and Japanese governments are as follows:</p>
<p>First proposal: It is stated that the Nineteen-Nation Committee has the obligation to strive to resolve this dispute without issuing a report, so according to the resolution of March 11, this draft resolution confirms that any resolution must be compatible with the trends of the League of Nations Covenant, the Pact of Paris, and the Nine-Power Treaty. The work of the Nineteen-Nation Committee is to guide negotiations in consultation with the two parties in the dispute, based on the articles in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report and taking into account the recommendations in Chapter 10. It also states that the Mediation Committee must be created by the Nineteen-Nation Committee, must have the cooperation of the United States and Russia, and has the right to adopt any plan it deems necessary to fulfill its duties. The Mediation Committee must issue a report on March 1, and if no agreement can be reached by then, the Mediation Committee may report to the League of Nations General Assembly, which has not yet adjourned.</p>
<p>Second proposal: Expresses gratitude for the work of the Lytton Investigation Team, and states that the Lytton Report will always be a model of faithful and impartial work. A description is attached to the two proposals for the guidance of the Committee, citing the resolution of December 9, and repeatedly stating that the work of the Committee is mediation based on Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant. The description urges prompt handling and recommends that authority be given to experts, who must be guided by the resolution of March 11, based on the principles contained in Chapters 8 and 9 of the Lytton Report, and taking into account Chapter 10. The description also states that it is not a simple matter of restoring the original state, nor can the status quo be continued. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Our Country Requires</h3>
<p>Amendments to the Draft Resolution</p>
<p>(The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sent a Telegram to the Delegation Yesterday)</p>
<p>Neither Specifies the Deadline for the Final Report</p>
<p>Nor Does it have a Method to Stop Japanese Aggression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Nineteen-Nation Committee passed the draft resolution drafted by the Five Nations, Yan Huiqing telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions. The draft resolution has four items: (1) Expressing pleasure with the report and reserving it for the Mediation Committee to cite; (2) Reaffirming the resolution of March 11 and stating that it should still be fulfilled; (3) Proposing that the Nineteen-Nation Committee, joined by Chinese and Japanese representatives, be changed to a Mediation Committee; (4) Inviting the United States and Russia to join the Mediation Committee. After Foreign Minister Luo received Yan's telegram, he discussed it with Song Ziwen and the Foreign Affairs Committee members in Beijing. It was confirmed that an important instruction had been sent to Yan late on the 16th, expressing extreme disappointment and instructing Yan to respond to the Nineteen-Nation Committee's request that China can only receive the draft resolution after it has been amended. It is heard that the reasons for our dissatisfaction are that the resolution neither specifies the date for making the final report, nor does it specify a method to sanction the aggressor. All the various requests made by our country at the League of Nations General Assembly have been completely ignored, so it is difficult to accept. It is expected that the instruction will arrive in Geneva by noon on the 17th. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>If Japan Does Not Give Up</h3>
<p>Recognition of the Puppet State of Manchukuo</p>
<p>There is No Room for Discussion of the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>Our Delegation Issues an Article</p>
<p>(Geneva) The spokesperson of the Chinese delegation issued an article today, explaining the opinion of the Chinese government on the draft resolution of the Nineteen-Nation Committee, stating that if Japan does not express its sincerity to accept this draft resolution as the basis for discussion, then conducting detailed discussions will be a waste of time. One of the necessary conditions on which we can proceed with mediation is that Japan should abandon its so-called "Manchukuo". (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) A spokesman for the Chinese delegation declared that the draft resolution of the Nineteen-Nation Committee was deeply disappointing. He said, "This draft resolution is far below our expectations. The biggest point is that the final report should have specified a specific date according to China's request, but the draft resolution has completely omitted this point, which is even more disappointing. In addition, no measures have been taken to deal with the situation in Manchuria or to prevent the Japanese from aggravating the situation." (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>The Drafting Committee Obsequiously Complies with Japan</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is believed that the Drafting Committee, due to the opposition of the Japanese representative, is now considering amending one point of the draft resolution and two or three points of the statement of reasons. What the Japanese side opposes is obviously the proposal to be based on the mediation methods contained in Chapters 9 and 10 of the Lytton Report, because this will limit the powers of the Committee. It is heard that Japan is also opposed to the Committee's draft specifically mentioning the United States and Russia. After the League of Nations inquired about the opinions of the United States and Russia on joining the mediation, it only received lukewarm replies. If the invitation issue is not cancelled, the Drafting Committee will definitely find a solution to dispel this opposition, which is to subtly include the intention to invite the United States and Russia without explicitly stating it. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Japanese Government's Instructions to Matsuoka</h3>
<p>Request to Amend the Original Plan</p>
<p>Hoping to Avoid Responsibility for the Outbreak of War</p>
<p>Rejecting the Participation of the United States and Russia</p>
<p>Insisting on Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The instructions to the Japanese delegation in Geneva, advocating the amendment of the draft resolution submitted to the General Assembly by the Nineteen-Nation Committee, have been approved by the Cabinet. It is heard that the amendment points include the "Nine-Power Treaty" figures in the draft resolution should be deleted, because the Nine-Power Treaty has nothing to do with the League of Nations Covenant. Also, the recommendations in Chapters 9 and 10 of the Lytton Report, which should be used to resolve the Sino-Japanese case, should also be deleted, because they advocate abolishing the recognition of "Manchukuo." Japan also suggests that the committee investigating this issue should be purely a research agency. Since the United States and Russia are not members of the League of Nations, Japan cannot agree to inviting the two countries to participate in the committee. Japan has reiterated its reservation and opposes the implementation of Article 15 of the Covenant in the Sino-Japanese case. (China United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 3:15 PM today, Foreign Minister Uchida entered the palace to meet with the Emperor and report on the situation in the League of Nations. The content of the reply instructions was approved. At 3:30 PM, the content of the reply instructions was discussed with each division chief and section chief of Guigu, Baichuan, Matsuda, and Morishima, and an immediate telegram was sent to Matsuoka Yosuke to act accordingly. The main points of the instructions are as follows: (1) The use of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Pact of Paris in the resolution seems to be blaming Japan for violating the first two treaties. Japan's actions will never violate this treaty, so the Nineteen-Nation Committee must be asked to delete this item. (2) The task of the Mediation Committee is to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute, which is far from Japan's position. Japan must firmly adhere to the position of direct Sino-Japanese negotiations. The powers of the Mediation Committee must be limited to promoting direct Sino-Japanese negotiations and assisting from the sidelines during the negotiations. (3) Inviting the United States and Russia to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. Japan has long opposed interference by third countries, and the two countries have nothing to do with the League of Nations. The Japanese government absolutely opposes enticing irresponsible countries to resolve the Liaoning case. (China United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Representative Publicly Releases an Atmosphere of Withdrawing from the League</h3>
<p>On the One Hand, it Agrees to the Mediation Procedure</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan has repeatedly issued threats to withdraw from the League of Nations, and today the League of Nations is once again in an uproar. It is said that the mediation plan for the Manchurian Incident discussed by the Chairman of the Nineteen-Nation Committee, De Huia, and the Japanese representative has broken down, and Japan is particularly opposed to the participation of the United States and Russia in the discussion. However, Soviet Russia does not want to accept the invitation of the League of Nations, so the entire Russian delegation, led by Mr. Litvinov, has set off to return home. The Chinese representative Yan Huiqing came to the station to see them off. (National News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese representative claimed that the only point in the League of Nations' proposal on the Sino-Japanese dispute that Japan could agree to was the mediation procedure. He has not yet received instructions from Tokyo, but there is no doubt that Japan's attitude will not yield. If necessary, Japan would rather withdraw from the League of Nations than accept this draft resolution. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Actions Extinguish Human Conscience</h3>
<p>People of Inner Mongolia Telegraph the League of Nations to Extend Justice</p>
<p>(Geneva) The people and officials of Inner Mongolia telegraphed the following message to the Chinese delegation: "The establishment of the League of Nations was originally intended to promote human happiness and maintain world peace, but Japan purely relies on military force, completely despises justice and fairness, and occupies the three northeastern provinces and eastern Mongolia without reason, massacring innocent civilians and establishing a puppet Manchukuo." It acts recklessly and unscrupulously, and its intention is to deceive mankind and destroy world peace, which violates international law and human conscience. This is what all the Mongolian people oppose. Now that the League of Nations is meeting, we hope that justice will be upheld, that Japan's aggression will not be allowed to continue, and that China's territory will be preserved in its integrity." The Chinese delegation has formally delivered this telegram to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, requesting that it be sent to all members of the General Assembly and all members of the Nineteen-Nation Committee. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Wu Chaochu Talks About the Unreliability of External Forces</h3>
<p>Wishing the Chinese People to Rejuvenate and Strengthen Themselves</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaochu said that the League of Nations is not surprising. The policy of the League of Nations can be summarized in one word: delay. And he pointed out that the great powers of the League of Nations each have their own positions, and so-called justice and fairness no longer exist in today's international community. If we do not strive to strengthen ourselves and hope for the help of external forces, it is like dreaming. My consistent position is to rely on ourselves and not rely on the cooperation of the great powers. The maintenance of mutual interests and the desire to support the weak and suppress the strong are willing to do. The remarks made by British Foreign Secretary Simon in Geneva recently have greatly surprised the Chinese people. I read it and did not find it surprising, because Simon is the British Foreign Secretary, and his starting point for seeking the interests of the United Kingdom should be based on the interests of the United Kingdom. If I were the British Foreign Secretary, I would do the same. If we can put ourselves in their shoes, it is not surprising. This is each person's duty, and we cannot blame him alone for siding with Japan. If so, then try to point out which of the great powers does not side with Japan. I hope that our people will have a deeper understanding of international observations, strive to rejuvenate and strengthen themselves, and not have a heart of dependence. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>The English Are Unfair to Persia</h3>
<p>Emphasis on the Oil Rights Case</p>
<p>Urging the League of Nations to Act Swiftly</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Anglo-Persian oil dispute case has been submitted to the League of Nations today. The British representative has submitted a lengthy document of thirty pages to the League of Nations Secretariat, which will be published when the Executive Council meets next week. The Persian representative is currently consulting with the Secretary-General, hoping to slightly delay the commencement of the investigation so that the Persian government can present its case in detail. However, the British representative wants to submit the written arguments immediately so that the League of Nations can act promptly. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The National Federation of Peace Organizations held a meeting today and passed three resolutions: 1) The association deems the note sent by the British government to the Persian government on November 2 regarding the mining rights dispute to contain threatening language, which it considers inappropriate. 2) It strongly urges that the Anglo-Irish dispute be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague for adjudication. 3) It declares that the British government should not adopt any measures on the issues of war debts and reparations that are contrary to the attitude of France, and that the issues provisionally resolved by the Lausanne Conference should not be reopened. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Pro-Japan Stance Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign news, Britain's pro-Japan stance has not changed despite its verbal statements. The reason the draft resolution of the Nineteen-Nation Committee failed to fully uphold justice is still due to the British representative siding with Japan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Simon to Visit Geneva Again</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the dispute between Britain and Persia over oil concessions, Foreign Secretary Simon will represent the British government and speak at the Executive Council of the League of Nations. Simon will travel to Geneva today or tomorrow. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Czechoslovak and Yugoslav Representatives Return Home</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Czech Foreign Minister Beneš returned to Prague last night, and Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Fotitch has also departed for home. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan Dispatches Kabayama to Lobby in the United States</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government believes that American public opinion remains unfavorable to Japan, and despite Dr. Nitobe's presence in the United States for nearly a year, he has not achieved any results. This time, they intend to send Kabayama Aisuke, Vice President of the Japan-America Association, to lobby in the United States. Kabayama is scheduled to sail overseas next spring, ostensibly as the Japanese Commissioner-General for the Chicago World's Fair. (China United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Providing a Further Explanation for the British Government and Clearly Informing the World</h3>
<p>Since British Foreign Secretary Simon delivered his pro-Japanese remarks at the League of Nations General Assembly on the 7th of this month, this newspaper has commented on it twice, deeply regretting his lack of understanding and the fact that it would further exacerbate global disputes. Now, the British government authorities have made a statement, saying that Simon's remarks at the League of Nations General Assembly were intended to promote reconciliation and were not biased towards any party. This expression is indeed sufficient to refresh the ears and eyes of impartial people around the world and dispel their doubts. However, there are still things we cannot help but say, and we would like to provide a further explanation for the British government and clearly inform the world.</p>
<p>The British authorities said: "Britain is a loyal member of the League of Nations and will never lag behind in upholding the dignity of the Covenant." This expression is indeed very firm and bright. But in terms of facts, who was the culprit in undermining the Covenant when the September 18th Incident occurred last year? Even a three-foot-tall child should know. However, a year has passed, and the Northeast Incident has not yet obtained any fair solution in the League of Nations. Every time the League of Nations has a resolution, Japan blatantly violates it, and the League of Nations is intimidated by violence. In order to perfunctorily deceive the world, they have sent an investigation team. Here, we are deeply concerned that the solemn Covenant for maintaining international justice and peace will be torn apart by violence.</p>
<p>This time, the General Assembly has reopened, and the Lytton Commission's report has clearly presented the actual situation of the Northeast Incident to the world. Moreover, Japan's continuous acts of violence over the past year, such as invading Rehe and officially recognizing the puppet organization, are sufficient for the League of Nations to clearly recognize Japan's true colors. In our initial intention, we thought that the Northeast Incident in the League of Nations would finally have a chance to obtain a fair solution this time. Unexpectedly, today's League of Nations is still no different from yesterday's League of Nations. Gathering politicians and diplomats from all over the world in one hall, it still cannot maintain justice and give legitimate sanctions to violence.</p>
<p>Since the investigation team was commissioned by the League of Nations, its report should be trusted by the League of Nations. In this session of the General Assembly, it should especially implement fair trials based on this report. In the report, there are two very definite points in the conclusion on the September 18th Incident: 1) The Japanese military's violence on the night of September 18th cannot be regarded as an act of self-defense. 2) The Manchukuo puppet state cannot be regarded as being produced by a genuine and natural independent movement. If it is not self-defense, it is aggression. If it is not produced by a genuine and natural independent movement, it is monopolized by Japan. The facts are obvious and universally recognized. The League of Nations refuses to make a fair judgment based on the facts recognized in the report, and the British representative Simon, who claims to be a "loyal member" of the League of Nations, publicly expresses pro-Japanese remarks, supporting violence, causing justice to be suppressed and the Covenant to be broken. Therefore, the world's fair-minded people deeply regret the UK and express infinite disappointment with the League of Nations. How can it be strange?</p>
<p>Now that the British authorities have clearly declared their bright attitude, this bright attitude is indeed relied upon by the League of Nations and by world peace. However, we especially hope that the British authorities, in addition to earnestly expressing their bright attitude, will be stricter in demanding correctness in their actions, that is, based on the standpoint of maintaining the Covenant and maintaining peace, make fair suggestions to the General Assembly. Or, they can even adopt the attitude of resolutely invoking Article 15 of the Covenant in the Anglo-Persian oil case, and recommend to the General Assembly, in accordance with Article 15 of the Covenant, effective sanctions against the powerful, so that justice can finally be extended and peace can finally be maintained. Then the British government's upright attitude and spirit will be admired by all fair-minded people around the world.</p>
<p>Secondly, we still dare to say to the British government and to the just people of all countries in the world: Although the Chinese people are now under violent coercion, they firmly believe that violence will never swallow justice and will eventually be subdued by justice. At the same time, they firmly believe that the Chinese nation wants to seek its own independence and freedom for survival, and there is no other way but to rely on self-reliance and self-rescue. The Chinese people earnestly hope that the League of Nations and the just people of the world will rise up together to uphold justice, but they will never rely on the League of Nations, let alone trust any one country. They will rely on self-reliance and self-rescue and maintain the international Covenant, justice, and peace. The Chinese people have now made this determination. Fight on! Violence will eventually be laid to rest at the feet of justice.</p>
<h3>The Dongshan Anti-Japanese Association Confronts the Chao-Hai Customs</h3>
<p>Customs Officers Accuse Inspectors of Being Bandits</p>
<p>Arousing Public Outrage Among the Local People</p>
<p>(Shantou) The Anti-Japanese Association of the people of Dongshan County on the coast of Fujian intercepted a ship carrying enemy goods from Taiwan on the 27th of last month at Hukong, five miles from the city. Han Shishuang, a tax collector from the Dongshan Chao-Hai Customs, sent people to retrieve the goods and accused the inspectors of being bandits. On the 5th, the Customs sent a patrol boat to retrieve the intercepted goods, but seeing the public's anger, it sailed back to Shantou. On the 7th, it sent two more warships with dozens of soldiers carrying guns ashore, intending to break into the warehouse, making a fierce show of force. The local people, unarmed, lined up to confront them. Fearing a major incident, the customs soldiers retreated. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Shantou) The Dongshan County Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association sent telegrams and letters requesting assistance from organizations in Chaozhou and Shantou, stating that since the establishment of the anti-Japanese association in Yunxiao, Zhangpu, Zhaoan, and Dongshan, the transportation of enemy goods into the area and landing on the coast has disappeared. Customs personnel are protecting merchants engaged in illegal transportation, undermining the national salvation movement, and their crimes are unforgivable. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhennian's 1st Brigade Arrives in Wenzhou</h3>
<p>Advancing Towards Taishun and Fuding</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian telegraphed Nanjing, stating that his 1st Brigade had completely arrived in Wenzhou, with the 1st Regiment advancing towards Taishun, the 2nd Regiment advancing towards Fuding, and the 3rd Regiment and one machine gun company advancing towards Pingyang. The 2nd Brigade had arrived in Longquan one after another, and its special services and training teams had landed in Wenzhou one after another. He also telegraphed that the Independent Brigade was camping in Zhuji Village, waiting for ships to head south. Some ammunition was transported to the open space in Hailangshi Nantou in preparation for loading onto ships. At 6 PM on the 15th, a haystack nearby suddenly caught fire, causing the ammunition of the 8th Regiment, 2nd Battalion of the brigade to be ignited and explode. The losses were not severe, and the cause of the fire is unknown and is being investigated. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The Yantai Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations jointly telegraphed Shen Honglie, briefly stating that the Navy's two deployments in Yantai were deeply appreciated by the people, and there were no disturbances, which was admired by Chinese and foreigners. They requested a permanent presence to avoid the inconvenience of troop transfers and to fulfill the expectations of the people. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government and Chairman Han for instructions, they earnestly requested approval as requested to comply with the situation. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Enter Xiuyan City, County Magistrate Liu Jingwen Flees</h3>
<p>The main force of the Amano unit, which began operations on the 13th from Dashiqiao, broke through the National Salvation Army along the way and entered Xiuyan City at 11:30 AM on the 16th. Xiuyan is a mountain city surrounded by towering mountains and ridges, with a population of about 20,000. Liu Jingwen served as the county magistrate, and although he had built trenches around Xiuyan County City before noon on the 10th, upon learning of the Japanese military's fierce attack, he fled the day before. Li, the county magistrate who traveled from Shenyang, officially took office when the Japanese troops entered the city. Upon arrival, the Japanese military surrounded about 3,000 volunteer soldiers led by Li Zirong, Tie Mei, and Qiu Liangchen in the area of Lazhuyueduier in Xiuyan Oudao Yanghe Huanghuagang. However, Deng Tiemei had escaped the encirclement and fled to the Jiguanshan area. Qiu Liangchen's Big Sword Society, about 1,000 strong, clashed with the Public Security Team on the 15th, and 300 members were injured. They seem to have entered the mountains of Yimianshan. While searching, the Jing'an Guerrilla Team, camping about two miles north of Zhuanghe, was suddenly attacked by the volunteer army on the 15th, and fierce fighting was still ongoing at noon. Continuing the advance team of the 00th Regiment's guard unit, its security line suddenly became tense. The encirclement line of Amano's 0th Regiment is gradually shrinking, intending to drive the remaining volunteer army to the Dahu Mountain area, and then attack from the sea, land, and air, sweeping away the volunteer army in the triangular area. (Dentsu News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3>Nanjing City Party Headquarters Sends Telegram to Encourage Tang Yulin</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing City Party Headquarters telegraphed Tang Yulin on the 17th, briefly stating that Rehe is a barrier to North China, and its survival is related to the safety of the entire country. The Japanese invaders' attempts are increasingly urgent, and they must do their utmost to resist and not allow an inch of territory to fall into enemy hands. They vowed to lead all party members and the people of the city to serve as a backing for the official. (Central News Agency dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing City Party Headquarters resolved on the 17th: 1) Telegraph Tang Yulin in Rehe to actively resist the Japanese invaders and defend the national territory, and send telegrams to the whole country to provide unanimous assistance. 2) Han Hao and Hu Lifu colluded with the enemy to harm the Republic of China, and requested the central government to bring them to military trial to set an example.

<h3>Japanese Actively Organizing Puppet National Defense Forces</h3>
<p>Changchun Designated Three Defense Circles to Prevent Volunteer Army Attacks</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese are actively organizing puppet national defense forces. The 2nd Army was commissioned by the Japanese to Cheng Guorui as the puppet army commander and Huang Xiling as his deputy. They took office on the 3rd in the courtyard of Tang's mansion on Sanjing Road in Shenyang. The army consists of the 4th, 7th, and 6th detachments, with Wang Jiaju, Liu Peichen, and Wang Huaxi as the detachment commanders. The 4th detachment is stationed in Xinlitun, the 7th detachment is stationed in Dahushan, and the 6th detachment is stationed in Jinzhou. The puppet army headquarters is stationed in Shenyang. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese in Jinzhou are extensively recruiting and organizing troops under the guise of national salvation. Recently, the Japanese military transported 20 heavy artillery pieces and two armored trains from Shenyang to northern Manchuria to deal with our anti-Japanese troops. The airfield built by the Japanese at Feng Yong University is very large, capable of accommodating 400 aircraft, and underground warehouses have been built. The puppet state is currently planning to build many radio stations, and construction is underway in Jin County, Liaoyuan, and Tonghua. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet state sent Englishman Edward to Geneva to assist Ding Shiyuan, who had been previously dispatched, in propaganda for the puppet state. The East Asian People's Alliance founded by the Japanese Huang Mu recruited tens of thousands of bandits in a few months and is now being wound up. The bandits who were recruited will be handed over to the Kwantung Army for disposal. Huang has recently returned to China and has no intention of returning to Shenyang. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Because Changchun, the puppet capital, is frequently attacked by the volunteer army, the people's hearts are constantly shaken. The Kwantung Army headquarters instructed the Military Police Headquarters to jointly discuss a proper defense method with the puppet Garrison Headquarters. It is reported that it has been decided to adopt three defense methods, that is, to designate three circles with Changchun as the center. The third circle takes Changchun City as the scope and is surrounded by barbed wire and various latest equipment. The second circle is jointly defended by the military police. The first circle is the front line, stationed by Japanese and traitorous troops. Sentries are stationed at all large and small roads to check pedestrians, and if there is any suspicion, they will be arrested and interrogated on the spot. The three defense lines are connected by telephone and military radio, so if there are any changes nearby, the entire city can be armed and defended in an instant to ensure the safety of the puppet capital.

<h3>Li Jishen's Resignation is Determined</h3>

He earnestly requested permission to resign from all his concurrent positions to recuperate, and he especially hoped to examine his body and mind during the recuperation period to help him reduce his mistakes. If his health recovers, he will still go to Nanjing to request to be driven. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Southwestern Executive Department</h3>
<p>Replies to Su Bingwen by Telegram</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Southwestern Executive Department replied to Su Bingwen by telegram on the 15th, saying that during the fall of the Northeast, the people of the headquarters had consistently advocated resisting with all their strength from beginning to end, but the authorities hesitated in the event of an event, causing the world to only hear appeals, which was not enough to concern international attention or express the personality of the nation. Fortunately, there were national salvation volunteers resisting the enemy, but they ultimately retreated due to lack of support. Looking at the authorities, they indulged in ease and ignored them. It is hoped that the generals will continue their efforts and seek final victory. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Most Tibetan Troops Still Stationed in the Qamdo Area</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Xining states that Jyekundo is an important pass in Hainan, and Ma Xun is supervising his troops to defend it diligently. The central government will send personnel to offer condolences and find ways to provide food and supplies. Most of the Tibetan troops are still stationed in the upper reaches of the Jinsha River and Lancang River, and the Qamdo area, intending to spy on Lian Ding in the west and invade Hainan in the north next spring. Two Qing armies are currently stationed at Chunke Temple, cooperating with the Sichuan army to provide support. Ma Bufang is mediating the feelings of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. The Dalai Lama has allowed the Panchen Lama to return to Tibet. Ma sent Wang Zheng to represent him in welcoming the Panchen back to Qinghai and then schedule his return to Tibet.

<h3>Irigoyen, Over Seventy Years Old, Still Has Political Ambition</h3>
<p>Bomb Explosion Reveals Conspiracy</p>
<p>Once Ruled the People, Now a Prisoner</p>
<p>Argentina Announces National Emergency Alert</p>
<p>National News Agency, Buenos Aires, 16th - Former Argentine President Irigoyen, once known as the most tyrannical leader in Latin America, was arrested and imprisoned today for plotting to overthrow the government. Irigoyen is now 87 years old, and although old, his ambition has not waned. After being re-elected president in 1928, he still held absolute power, and his cabinet members became mere figureheads. This led to a sudden revolution on February 6, 1930, which resounded throughout the country. Irigoyen was forced to abdicate, but remained in the capital, guaranteeing that he would no longer engage in political activities. However, the government has recently received reports of Irigoyen's activities. With today's bomb case, detectives seized documents and other evidence, discovering that Irigoyen was plotting to overthrow the government. President Uriburu ordered his arrest. The discovery of the conspiracy was due to a bomb explosion today. Police searched and discovered 1,300 bombs hidden in various important places in the capital, preparing to launch an uprising to overthrow the government and seize the army. There was also considerable contact with the provinces, preparing to launch uprisings simultaneously. It was learned that Irigoyen was the mastermind behind this. After the authorities raided various revolutionary agencies in the capital and arrested 50 accomplices, they immediately asked Congress to authorize the government to declare a national emergency alert (i.e., a state of siege, which is slightly less severe than martial law), and urgently ordered secret service personnel to investigate the situation in various provinces to determine whether the military and police were completely reliable.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Buenos Aires, 16th - A bomb suddenly exploded at the residence of former President Dr. Irigoyen today. Police went to investigate and discovered thousands of bombs and arrested 15 people. Dr. Irigoyen belongs to the Radical Party. He served as president during the European War, and one of his greatest achievements was keeping Argentina from falling into the war vortex. Dr. Irigoyen tried his best to seek happiness for the laboring class in domestic affairs. The revolution of 1930 occurred, and Dr. Irigoyen left office; otherwise, his term would have lasted until 1934.</p>
<p>▲ Continued Report - Former President Alvear was also arrested. Alvear and Dr. Irigoyen will both be expelled from the country. The cabinet decided to implement a strict plan to maintain order and asked Congress to declare a state of siege. Police were ordered to search the Radical Party headquarters and ordered the newspaper "Public Opinion Freedom" to cease publication. In addition to the bombs, military equipment was also seized at his residence. Police also seized the party's plan, knowing that they planned to capture President Uriburu, occupy various government offices, and use bombs to create terror. Radical Party leaders were clearly involved in this revolutionary conspiracy, and authorities have arrested many people everywhere.</p>
<h3>Shaodan's Cabinet Formation Fails</h3>
<p>Peng Gu Ordered to Try to Form New Cabinet</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 16th - The President ordered former Interior Minister Shaodan to try to form a cabinet. Shaodan had accepted, but because Herriot refused to participate, he resigned from his mission to form a cabinet to the President at 8 PM tonight.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 16th - Peng Gu claimed tonight that the President has formally ordered him to form a new cabinet. He will announce whether or not to accept it tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 17th - Peng Gu negotiated with party leaders almost all night yesterday to gain the support of a majority of members of the House of Representatives and change his attitude towards the American war debt issue. It is said that he did not make much progress. Peng Gu will meet with the President at noon today to inform him that he is willing to accept the mission to form a cabinet. Political circles claim that Peng is a senator and is therefore not swayed by the resolutions of the House of Representatives. Having a senator like Peng form a cabinet is the only way to break the deadlock.</p>
<h3>Philippine Authorities Plan to Seize the Livelihood of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Schools Add Retail Skills</p>
<p>To Compete with Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>National News Agency, Manila, 17th - The Philippine Department of Education will implement a plan to educate Filipinos in retail skills starting next year to compete with Chinese merchants. Most of the retail businesses in the Philippines are controlled by overseas Chinese. According to statistics from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, only 18% to 20% of the retail businesses in the entire island are held by Filipinos, while the rest are in the hands of foreigners, with overseas Chinese holding 50% to 60%. Currently, the large stores opened by Filipinos have difficulty competing with Chinese merchants. Therefore, the Philippine authorities have decided to educate the people in the knowledge of retail business. It is temporarily scheduled to add a retail skills course to all secondary schools on the island starting next school year (starting in June next year).</p>

<h3>Resolving the War Debt Issue</h3>
<p>Hoover is Considering Three Procedures</p>
<p>Plans to No Longer Consult with Roosevelt</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 16th - It is now confirmed that US President Hoover is considering three procedures for resolving the war debt issue. 1. Congress establishes a war debt committee. Hoover still considers this the best of the three options, but he also knows that Congress will oppose the revival of this kind of institution. 2. The existing diplomatic agencies negotiate separately with each debtor nation. If this procedure is adopted, Hoover hopes that each country can submit valuable reports and suggestions so that they can obtain considerable support from Congress in the future. 3. The President himself appoints informal committee members to contact foreign officials on the war debt issue and then make a detailed report on the situation in Europe and the economic situation that will result from continuing the current debt repayment schedule, or the economic consequences of writing off a portion of the debt, so that the President can more easily make special recommendations to Congress. However, regardless of which procedure Hoover chooses, it is heard that he will no longer consult with Roosevelt. Hoover is now trying to resolve this matter before his term expires. If he cannot, it will be transferred to the next president to handle. It is also heard that Hoover is willing to discuss the possibility of amending the agreement for the war debts owed by France, even though they are in default. However, he still does not want to participate in any war debt conference. Yesterday, France, Belgium, Hungary, Estonia, and Poland defaulted on their war debts. Americans were not surprised by this. Today, the Secretary of the Treasury announced that the total amount of these defaults was 14,996,551.85 gold yuan. The total amount paid by Britain, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania was 98,685,906.3 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Philippine Independence Bill</h3>
<p>Hawes-Cutting Advocates</p>
<p>A Twenty-Year Trial Period</p>
<p>Worse Than George III's Maladministration</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 16th - Today, the US Senate again rejected the amendment by Roussad to allow the Philippines to become independent within eight years, and replaced it with a compromise measure, proposed by the original proponents of the Hawes-Cutting Bill, advocating that the Philippines be allowed to become independent after twelve years. During this transition period, for the first seven years, except for special restrictions on sugar, coconut oil, and ropes, the remaining goods will still be allowed to be imported into the United States duty-free. In the last five years, Philippine goods will be subject to import duties, increasing annually, starting from 5% to 25%. This tax revenue will be used to repay the existing public debt of the Philippines, because Congress firmly insists that the Philippines must repay its public debt and resolve all financial entanglements before starting an independent life. It is now expected that the entire Hawes-Cutting Bill will require several more days of discussion before it can be voted on. The differences between this bill and the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act passed by the House of Representatives are expected to be easily reconciled in the joint conference committee of the two houses in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Manila, 17th - Philippine Senate President Quezon, comparing the US Senate's proposed independence plan for the Philippine Islands with the harsh administration of King George III, convened members of the Philippine legislature today to consider the matter. Quezon said that according to the news received, the US Senate's struggle did not give the Philippines independence, but rather closed the door to America, rejecting Philippine workers and products.</p>
<p>Amidst Financial Panic</p>
<h3>The Japanese Dream of Gold</h3>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 17th - According to the Japanese Ministry of Finance's bulletin, the situation of foreign exchange balance for the quarter of 1931 is deteriorating, and expenditure exceeds income by 290 million yuan, an increase of 115 million yuan compared to the previous year's deficit.</p>
<p>▲ China United News Agency, Tokyo, 17th - The Japanese economic circles are increasingly panicked by the national emptiness caused by military spending for aggression. The Bank of Japan issued 1.1 billion yuan in banknotes, with only 400 million yuan in gold bullion in exchange. As a result, exchange rates are gradually falling, so the Japanese are frantically searching for gold. Last year, it was said that 200 million yuan worth of placer gold mines were discovered in the mountains of Taiwan, and political, financial, and press circles sent people to investigate, but nothing was found. This year, a sea-sweeping gold-seeking company was organized to search for a Russian ship carrying gold that sank at sea several years ago. Now, Miki Bukichi says that 400 million yuan worth of gold mines buried in Hokkaido have been discovered and that methods have been devised to try to mine them. At 9:00 AM today, Miki returned to Tokyo from Hokkaido, and many gold-crazed people came to greet him. The Japanese government has decided to allocate 200,000 yuan in funding to try to mine gold in Taiwan and Korea. It can be said that the Japanese are gripped by a nationwide gold craze.</p>
<p>The Ban on the Former German Emperor's Return to the Country Will Be Lifted</p>
<h3>Rumors of Restoration Resurface</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 16th - Today, after the German newspaper "Die Welt" reported that the German government will immediately lift the ban on the former Emperor Wilhelm's return to the country, the German people are paying attention to the possibility of restoration once again. According to the newspaper, the law protecting the Republic will expire at the end of December this year, and the cabinet will meet tomorrow to discuss the issue of extension. It is likely that only the ban on the former Emperor's return to the country will be lifted, and several other items will be deleted. Most of the provisions will still be retained. As for the restoration, it is said today that since the people do not currently demand the restoration of the imperial system, even if the ban on the former Emperor's return to the country is lifted, it cannot be interpreted as an attempt to restore the monarchy. A commentator once explained the current situation, saying that Germany is a republic in law, but there are no advocates of democracy. Even if the former Emperor returns to the country, he will see that his country has no advocates of restoring the monarchy. It is also generally believed that this move is only intended to allow the former Emperor to return to the country and reunite with his family, and there are no other intentions.</p>
<h3>US Democratic Party's Asian Policy (Part 2)</h3>
<p>John Hay stated, "For the sake of maintaining the lives of the American people, China is a business and industrial enterprise for Americans. We must demand that its doors be open and that opportunities are equal. We must abolish all differential treatment in American trade with China or in treaties, whether in spheres of influence or in leaseholds in that country, so that we can maintain America's permanent prosperity and increase the welfare of Americans." Since John Hay issued his statement, enlightened people have regarded it as a just argument. Therefore, no matter which party is in power, they will never change this policy. Therefore, the US Asian policy, although seemingly focused on economic aspects, is actually paying close attention to political power.</p>
<p>However, since Japan and Britain are fostering economic power in China, and Japan's political and economic power in China since the Sino-Japanese War has become increasingly unassailable, the US's attempt to expand and foster superior rights in China will have its strong enemy in Japan. Why? Britain's economic power in China has gradually declined after the Opium War, while Japan's has expanded year by year. If the US wants to implement John Hay's policy, it must restrain Japan.</p>
<p>3. The Unchanging US Policy and Facts. As mentioned above, the US Asian policy was originally a policy of suppressing Japan. This policy has been tried to be realized since the time of President Theodore Roosevelt. After the Russo-Japanese War, Roosevelt took it upon himself to mediate. US railroad tycoon Harriman vigorously promoted the management rights of the South Manchurian Railway, but was rejected by Japan. He then collaborated with Britain to establish the Jin-Ai Railway, but was also rejected by Japan and Russia. Later, when the Democratic Party replaced the Republican Party in power (Wilson), the US Far Eastern policy seemed to have changed. However, when the European War broke out in 1914, Japan took Qingdao and occupied all German rights in Shandong under the Anglo-Japanese alliance. The following year, Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to China, at which point the US rose up in opposition. Later, China participated in the war in the name of the Allied Powers, and the US encouraged the Chinese government to declare all treaties, declarations, and statements between China and Germany invalid to the world. When the European War ended, at the Paris Peace Conference, Japan's important proposals regarding all rights in Qingdao and Shandong Province were rejected. This was all due to President Wilson's machinations. Fortunately, at that time, the Fiume issue caused a conflict between the plenipotentiaries of the US and Italy. The Italian financial tycoon withdrew from the meeting, and the peace conference almost broke down. Fearing that Japan would follow Italy, the US had no choice but to allow Japan's proposal. However, the US's oppression of Japan remained consistently unchanged because the US inherited John Hay's policy and would not stop until it achieved its goal.</p>
<p>4. The Inevitable Fate of Japan and the United States. In 1920, Wilson failed in the election, and Republican Harding succeeded him as president. He convened the Washington Conference, first passing a bill rejecting Japanese immigrants, and then using the London Conference to impose various means of oppression on Japan, isolating Japan. Because of its Asian policy, the facts of the past show that it remains unchanged. However, our people (Japanese) believe that the Democratic Party's victory this time can change its Asian policy. Isn't this just wishful thinking? Today, Japanese often say that Manchuria and Mongolia are Japan's lifeline and are willing to gamble the nation's fate. However, Americans also say that China is America's lifeline and will not allow Japan to dominate it and abandon its century-old plan. Therefore, I say that Japan and the US, separated by the Pacific Ocean, want to compete for this good bait of China, and a war between the two sides will inevitably break out to determine the victor. I hope that the people of our country (Japan) will wake up and not be misled by the fallacies of those who do not understand the general trend of the world. (The End)</p>

<h3>Northeast Problem and the League of Nations (4)</h3>
<p>Participation of the Investigation Team</p>
<p>Verbal Battle Between Chinese and Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>The signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty signed in Washington on February 6, 1922, including Japan, in view of China's need for a transitional period during its reconstruction, jointly agreed to "provide China with the fullest and least obstructed opportunity to develop and maintain for herself an effective and stable government." Unfortunately, one of the greatest difficulties for China in its progress towards unification and construction has been Japan's repeated obstruction of its success. Let's cite one example to illustrate this. Goto Shimpei, a prominent Japanese politician, in his Japanese booklet "Activities of the Japanese People and Army in Manchuria and Mongolia," stated explicitly that when Yuan Shikai was unifying China in the early years of the Republic of China, the Japanese side organized a restoration movement in the three northeastern provinces to overthrow Yuan. The booklet stated directly that Japanese financier Okura Kihachiro provided a large sum of money to Prince Su of the Manchu Qing Dynasty to immediately carry out this movement. Goto also mentioned that Colonel Dohi, commander of the 5th regiment of the Japanese army at the time, was ordered to lead a large number of junior Japanese officers to organize and plan anti-Yuan troops. However, this is a rather old matter, and you may not remember it well. Now, let me present more recent facts to you. In 1927 and 1928, the Japanese government twice dispatched heavy troops to Jinan, the provincial capital of Shandong, ostensibly to protect Japanese residents who were in no danger. In reality, it was to obstruct General Chiang Kai-shek's victorious National Revolutionary Army from unifying North China and bringing it under the control of the Nanjing National Government. On May 28, 1928, the Japanese government, through Prime Minister Tanaka, issued a threatening declaration, stating that if further disturbances occurred in the Beijing and Tianjin areas, Japan would be forced to take appropriate steps to maintain peace and order in the three northeastern provinces. Shortly after this declaration was issued, General Zhang Zuolin was killed in a bomb attack on his train. The purpose of the declaration was also to obstruct the success of China's unification. Subsequently, the Japanese Consul-General in Shenyang, Special Envoy Baron Hayashi, and Japanese Brigade Commander Sato warned General Zhang Xueliang not to contact the Nanjing central government and not to raise the blue sky with a white sun and a field of red flag. On August 9, 1928, General Zhang Xueliang visited Baron Hayashi at the Japanese Consulate-General in response to an invitation and received the same warning. Zhang Xueliang then raised a protest, asking whether this attitude of Japan was reasonable, to which Sato replied, "This is not the time to discuss the reasonableness or unreasonableness of any event. Prime Minister Tanaka has decided that a new flag should not be flown at this time, and that alone is sufficient reason." From the above, it can be seen that Japan, on the one hand, loudly appealed to the world about China's disunity, while on the other hand, insisted on pursuing its policy of obstructing China's unification. This is an extremely strange and meaningful fact, which we must pay attention to. The question for us here is whether Japan sincerely desires China's unification. We can clearly see that Japan deeply fears that after China is unified, Japan's imperial development policy and its hope of conquering the world will be dealt a blow. The Investigation Team's report states on page 13, "From Japan's perspective, the core of the problem lies in its concern about the political development of the new China and its future trends." If we carefully consider the meaning between the lines, we can get its true meaning. The importance of the integrity of any country's organization lies in its impact on the relations of that country with other countries. This impact can often be expressed by many factors, and the development of foreign trade is one of them. In this regard, China's performance is not inferior to that of other countries. In the past 20 years, although countries around the world have developed a perception of China due to a kind of organized and malicious propaganda, China has made a very significant and gradually increasing contribution to the world economy. China's foreign trade statistics are the best tool to refute the accusations of Japanese critics. In 1911, China's total foreign trade was Customs Silver 849,000,000 taels. In 1921, it increased to Customs Silver 1,500,000,000 taels. In 1930, it increased to Customs Silver 2,204,000,000 taels. In other words, China's foreign trade has increased by as much as 158% in the past 20 years. Another reliable indicator of the degree of perfection of a country's political organization is the degree of loyalty and cooperation shown by that country to other countries in respecting international treaties. This cooperation is an indispensable requirement for the realization of a new international life and the organization of world peace. If we use this point as a yardstick, we may ask to what extent has Japan's national organization reached perfection? The real difficulty for the League of Nations at present regarding the incident in the three northeastern provinces is Japan's refusal to respect its international obligations, such as those clearly stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, and its refusal to implement its promises to the Administrative Yuan to withdraw Japanese troops stationed in the three northeastern provinces to prevent the severity of the incident from increasing. We will not even ask whether this is due to the unwillingness of the Japanese government or whether it is due to the inability of the Japanese government to control its powerful and influential warlords. Its impact on the world is equally worrying. The League of Nations felt this last year, and today it probably still feels the same way. Regarding this point, if we want to deeply understand the situation in the Far East, we should first understand the purpose and impact of Japan's traditional expansion policy mentioned in the Investigation Team's report. This policy is called the "Continental Policy" by the Japanese, which is a continental policy of conquering Asia. Its steps are divided into two branches: one is North China, which involves invading the three northeastern provinces and North China from Korea, and the other is South China, which involves invading South China, Central China, and various places in the South China Sea, using Taiwan as a base. In the 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi of Japan advocated annexing China. In his letter to the King of Korea, he said:</p>
<p>"People's life in this world has never been more than a hundred years old. How can they live here in depression for a long time? I want to borrow your country's way to cross the mountains and the sea and go straight into the Ming Dynasty, so that its four hundred states will all be transformed into my customs, so as to implement the kingly way for hundreds of millions of years. This is Hideyoshi's long-cherished wish. All those who arrive overseas later will not be released. Your country first sent envoys and coins, and the emperor greatly appreciated it. On the day Hideyoshi enters the Ming Dynasty, he will lead his soldiers to the military camp as my guide."</p>
<p>In the mid-19th century, Kushima, the lord of the Saga domain and the Governor of Hizen, said in his memorial:</p>
<p>"The office of the Shogunete is known as the 'Great General Who Subdues the Eastern Barbarians.' The two characters 'Subduing the Barbarians' are a conspicuous symbol that will never change for all ages. Now that there has been peace for a long time and the morale of the soldiers is lazy, it is precisely the time to take advantage of the situation, display power abroad, and thus be able to reverse the national fortune and establish the national foundation."</p>
<p>Before Saigo Takamori, Okubo Toshimichi advocated annexing Korea and dividing China most vigorously. In his discussion of Japanese policy, he said:</p>
<p>"Japan's greatest hidden danger is Russia. Because of its location, Russia is most likely to obstruct Japan from implementing its continental policy. If Japan is determined to implement this policy, it should immediately form an alliance with Russia and divide the land of China equally."</p>
<p>The reason why I bring up the above sections is not because of their historical interest, but because of their great relevance to Japan's modern policy towards China and the Far East. The spirit contained in the above sections and the policy advocated are no different from Japan's current spirit and policy. On March 31, 1922, the Army and Navy Departments of Tokyo held an important joint meeting, which was attended by the highest-ranking officers of the Army and Navy. A new strategy was decided. The next day, the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun reported on the content of the meeting, stating that the highest military advisory body had decided that once a war broke out, Japan should immediately establish a close communication network with the Asian continent from Hankou, Shandong to Harbin, Sakhalin as the first line of defense. Regarding military action plans, the newspaper had the following shocking record: "In order to consolidate its defense line, Japan should first increase the garrison forces in Korea, Sakhalin, and Taiwan, and should use all its strength to obtain the free supply rights of the Hanyang and Pingxiang coal and iron mines, so as to enrich military needs, so that a long-term war can be relied upon, and a final victory can be expected. In order to prepare for the rapid transformation of international relations, Japan should first take Beijing, and at the same time occupy Shenyang and Changchun in the three northeastern provinces, so that there is no need to worry about the lack of supply of various materials."</p>
<p>In the spring of 1922, when the Japanese Diet was in session, Japanese Minister of the Army Yamanashi replied to a question from a member regarding the new military defense plan set by the Supreme Military Conference:</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>"A country that had close contact with Japan in the past (referring to the United Kingdom) has decided not to continue the alliance treaty. Therefore, once a war breaks out, Japan is in danger of being economically blockaded. In order to prevent this situation, Japan should occupy the mainland (referring to China) and Siberia to obtain sufficient food and military supplies."</p>
<p>For hundreds of years, the culmination of the efforts of Japanese soldiers to promote the two-pronged continental development policy, the first step of which is to focus on China as the starting point for conquering all of Asia. Its progress is started simultaneously from the north and the south, just like a scorpion attacking its victim with its head and tail at the same time. Here, we can understand why Japan insisted that China cede the Liaodong Peninsula and the island of Taiwan after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. Here, we can deeply understand Japan's seizure of China's Ryukyu Islands in 1879, its occupation of South Manchuria and annexation of Korea after the Russo-Japanese War, its dispatch of troops deep into Hankou in the center of the Yangtze River Basin in 1911, its occupation of Shandong from 1914 to 1922, its presentation of the Twenty-One Demands in 1915, and its hesitation to withdraw the expeditionary force to eastern Siberia, its dispatch of large forces to Jinan in 1927 and 1928, and finally its occupation of Shenyang and other cities on September 18 and 19, 1931, occupying the entire three northeastern provinces, ignoring world opinion, going back on its promises, violating its obligations, and its true meaning of refusing to withdraw its troops. If we measure it by the words of Okubo Toshimichi, we can know the true purpose of the secret treaties repeatedly concluded by the Japanese government with the Russian government in 1907, 1910, 1912, and 1916 to plot to divide Manchuria and Mongolia, and its secret exchange of letters with various countries in 1917 regarding South Manchuria and Shandong Province. And the recent intention of the Japanese government to try to find an allied country among European countries can also be clearly understood. We dare to say that this continental policy, which has been known to the leaders of the new China, is a real threat to peace in the Far East and a major source of unrest for countries around the world. The reason why it is so dangerous is that behind this policy, there is a warlord force that is accustomed to making its own decisions and is unwilling to repent, holding the most powerful war tools, and the method of satisfying its desires is to maintain military force and power everywhere. Although the inevitable unstable state of China during the transitional period should not be unnecessarily prolonged, it itself must not conflict with the new international life based on the rule of law and the principle of resolving disputes peacefully through international methods. Japanese warlords constantly obstruct the unification of China, increase China's difficulties, and use China's various hardships, such as floods and communist disturbances, to promote their land expansion and continental conquest policies. All of these are the real obstacles to peaceful understanding between China and Japan. Looking at the history of Sino-Japanese relations over the past 60 years can prove that my words are not false. Although Japan's continuous wars, military expeditions, and acts of aggression against China over the past 60 years have varied in their time and place of expression, the underlying policy of expansion, occupation, and conquest has continued consistently without any difference. We should pay attention to this policy, the goal of which is not only to acquire Manchuria and Mongolia. According to the memorial of former Japanese Prime Minister Tanaka Giichi, which was often cited by Japanese newspapers before September 1931, and the truthfulness of which was never doubted, controlling China's three northeastern provinces is just one step in conquering the world order. The memorial states:</p>
<p>"If we want to control China in the future, we must first defeat the power of the United States. The meaning of the Russo-Japanese War is largely the same. However if we want to conquer China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia. If we want to conquer world, we must first conquer China. If China can be completely conquered by our country, other peoples with different customs, such as those in Central Asia, India, and Southeast Asia, will fear and respect us and surrender to us, so that the world will know that East Asia is our East Asia, and will never dare to invade us. This is the legacy of Emperor Meiji, and it is also a necessary matter for the existence of our Japanese Empire."</p>
<p>This plan of Emperor Meiji is still not regarded by Japan as merely an event of historical interest. Judging from the speeches of important Japanese politicians and military personnel today, it seems that the grand strategy of Emperor Meiji is still the guiding force of Japan. Kita Ikki drafted an outline of a Japanese amendment to the legacy law in 1929. After the book was published, it became the bible of general young officers, and it still is today. The book states: "The state has the right to declare and wage war to defend itself or liberate oppressed nations, such as liberating India from the shackles of Britain, or China from the aggression of the great powers." The book also states:</p>
<p>"The state also has the right to wage war against countries that hold a large amount of territory or govern that territory poorly, such as taking Australia from Britain and taking Siberia from Russia." Mori Kaku, the former Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, published an article in the Kin'yū Ishi (Gold Stone) Economic Magazine in July of this year, stating that "The Japanese nation is bound by treaties and trapped within its own national borders. If the current interpretation of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact is allowed to remain unchanged, Japan will not be able to expand its power in the Far East. If we want to progress, we must break down the defense line of these treaties." The current Minister of the Army, Araki, is already world-famous. In a recent article in the Japanese Army organ magazine Kaikōsha Kiji, he encouraged the Japanese people to be loyal to the national spirit, and also said, "The countries of East Asia are the object of oppression by white people. This is an undeniable fact. Japan should no longer sit idly by and do nothing. The responsibility of the Japanese people lies in opposing all actions of the great powers that are not in accordance with the spirit of the Japanese Empire, because the spirit of the Empire is the embodiment of fairness and justice.

<h3>Sichuan War Becomes More Chaotic</h3>
<p>Twenty Thousand Deaths on Each Side in the Renjia Area</p>
<p>Tian Army Launches Surprise Attack on Liu Wenhui in the Chengdu Area</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Bloody Battle in Renjia</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Liu Xiang, the protagonist of the Sichuan War, after occupying Lu Nei and Fuyuan, in order to break up the united front of the Deng, Tian, and Liu factions, personally went to Neijiang to convene a meeting. Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, Li Qixiang, Luo Zezhou, and others all sent representatives to participate. The meeting was held on the 6th, and on the 7th, Liu Xiang issued the third general attack order, with all routes simultaneously mobilizing. The Chengdu battle also broke out again. Liu Wenhui's troops stationed in Chengdu numbered more than ten brigades, with troop strength doubling that of the Tian army. They were originally in a position of certainty to win. Because Deng Xihou mediated, Liu was also unwilling to break with Tian and was eager to resist the Chongqing army, so he abandoned Chengdu on the 9th, allowing the Tian army to garrison it. His troops were concentrated in the Xinjin, Chongqing, Wenjiang, Shuangliu, Renshou, Qingshen, Jiading, and Jingyan areas. It is said that there are still about 50,000 to 60,000 men in strength. Together with the Chen Hongwen and Chen Shunong factions, there are about 70,000 to 80,000 men. Although the two Chens had been assigned back to Deng Xihou's control, it did not become a reality. Therefore, although they retreated to a corner, they did not show weakness. Liu Xiang, seeing that Chengdu was exclusively occupied by the Tian army, wanted to take advantage of the situation to eliminate the 24th Army. Therefore, he dispatched the Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, and Wang Zhiyi divisions with lightning speed and advanced rapidly, with one army attacking Jiading as the left route, one army attacking Jingyan as the middle route, and one army attacking Renshou as the right route. Liu Xiang himself was stationed in Longchang, commanding and coordinating. The 24th Army also divided into three routes to meet the enemy. Liu Wenhui withdrew from Chengdu on the 9th and went to Jiading in person. The Chongqing army launched a general attack on the 7th, and until the 9th, it only engaged in guerrilla warfare with the provincial army and did not distinguish between victory and defeat. On the 10th, Liu Wenhui arrived in Jiading, and the battle suddenly became fierce. From the 10th to the 12th, there was a bloody battle for three days and nights. The lines of Jingyan and Renshou did not change much. On the Jiading line, the provincial army won. Liu Xiang heard the news in Longchang and urgently dispatched reinforcements. From the 14th, he launched a counterattack, and until dawn on the 16th, there was another bloody battle for two days and two nights. Including the previous battles, there were a total of five days and five nights. Neither side rested, and the number of soldiers killed reached more than 20,000. The number of wounded was not included, and the number of civilians killed and injured was also large. In the Sichuan War over the years, the sacrifice was the greatest in this battle. Liu Xiang, because the left route was frustrated, in addition to dispatching reinforcements, urgently telegraphed Tian Songyao to send troops to attack his rear route. Tian, having exclusively occupied Chengdu, had already achieved his goal. However, because he and Liu Xiang touted cooperation, he also divided his troops into three routes and advanced towards Liu Wenhui's defense area. The 1st Division, Zeng Nanfu, and the 2nd Route, He Deyu, were assigned to the left route and advanced towards Renshou's Jitianpu. The 3rd Division, Luo Bochang, and the 1st Route, Liu Hanxiong, were assigned to the middle route and advanced towards Shuangliu. The 1st Division, Dong Changan, and the 28th Army, Huang Yin, were assigned to the right route and advanced towards Wenjiang and Chongqing, echoing Liu Xiang's troops from afar. Among them, the Huang Yin Division was under Deng Xihou's command. Although Deng was stationed in Chengdu, he did not help the Tian army attack the 24th Army. This time, Huang's division set out without Deng's order, which was his personal free action. The system of the Sichuan army is chaotic, and discipline is lost. Such cases are countless. It is difficult for Liu Wenhui to take care of all parties with the strength of one army. However, since his defense line has been shortened, and his troops have been concentrated, all the generals and soldiers, with their survival at stake, are willing to fight to the death. If they win, they can still sweep through Chengdu and restore Lu Nei. If they lose, they can still retreat to Yaan, make a comeback. Therefore, from the current situation, if Liu Xiang expresses his withdrawal early, obeys the orders of the central government, and forces Liu Wenhui to step down under certain conditions, the 24th Army may disintegrate invisibly. If he is too hasty, their unity will be stronger. The conclusion of the Sichuan War is still unknown. (December 16)</p>
<h3>Second Street Battle in Chengdu</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Chengdu was originally garrisoned by the Liu Wenhui, Tian Songyao, and Deng Xihou factions. However, the Tian faction recently took advantage of the fact that Liu's troops were battling Liu Xiang's troops in the Yizhou area and suddenly attacked Liu's troops stationed in Chengdu. As a result, the Tian army collapsed and withdrew from Chengdu and lost the arsenal. Then Deng Xihou came forward to make peace, using the unity of the Baoding clique as a cover, and convened a three-army cooperation meeting. At that time, the Tian army had just been defeated, and its vigor had not recovered, so it naturally admitted defeat. Liu Wenhui thought that after contacting the Deng and Tian armies, he could deal with the 20th Army with all his strength. Therefore, he first held a three-army peace conference in Tianhui Town (30 li away from Chengdu), and then further held a five-army cooperation meeting in Chengdu. Participants included Liu Zhaogan, the commander of the 1st Division of the Sichuan Shaanxi Army; representatives Fu Jianwu and Su Mou; Qiao Zhongquan, Wang Weizi, and Liu Jafan, the commanders of the 20th Army; Liu Wenhui, Xiang Yuren, Leng Yindong, and Wu Jingbo, the commanders of the 24th Army; Deng Xihou, Yang Xiuchun, Ma Dezai, and Huang Yin, the commanders of the 28th Army; and Sun Zhen, Dong Changan, Luo Bochang, and Wang Mingzhang, the commanders of the 29th Army. The resolutions are as follows: (1) The five armies should act in unison, cooperate thoroughly, and form an alliance to attack and defend. However, in order to maintain the dilapidated situation, they should adhere to the principle of "I will not attack if others do not attack me." (2) The finances of the five divisions should be open, and the stationing should be averaged according to the circumstances. Efforts should be made to supplement them. (3) The five divisions should be stationed together in Chengdu and telegraph Liu Xiang to open up Chongqing and Wanxian, break the defense zone system, and withdraw from all counties occupied by the 24th Army, which should be handled by the five armies. Therefore, at that time, the voice of cooperation among the five divisions rose to the clouds, and the Sichuan Political Consolidation Committee was also established in Chengdu. Ten members were elected, including Sun Decao and Ma Yaosheng (29th Army), Wu Jingbo and Xiang Yuren (24th Army), Wang Weizi and Qiao Zhongquan (20th Army), representative Su and Fu Jianwu (Sichuan Shaanxi Army), Wen Mengtao and Yang Xiuchun (28th Army). Unexpectedly, at noon on the 10th, the Tian army suddenly took advantage of the 24th Army's unpreparedness, and Sun Decao led the Luo Bochang and Zeng Xiantong divisions to launch a fierce attack on Chengdu. The Chengdu guard brigade of the 24th Army, led by Shi Zhaohuo, was defeated. At the same time, fierce fighting broke out at the southeast gates. Street battles also broke out in the city's Jiangjun Street and other places. The 24th Army set fire to civilian houses on Wenmiao West Street. Finally, because reinforcements did not arrive, Shi's division withdrew from Chengdu on the night of the 12th and camped at Xinjin, Shuangliu, and the outer east arsenal, preparing for a counterattack. On the 13th, Sun led 3 regiments to attack the arsenal, and fierce fighting broke out again. As for Liu Wenhui himself, he is currently stationed in Meishan, and the military headquarters is also located in Meishan. The provincial government plans to move from Chengdu to Meishan in the next few days. All the 24th Army troops, such as Chen Mingqian, Zhang Deping, Chen Hongwen, Leng Yindong, Peng Han, Yu Lie, Liu Wencai, and Li Yushu, are stationed in Jiading, Qionglai, Jiajiang, Pengshan, Jingyan, Meishan, and Renshou, with a troop strength of about 60 regiments. On the afternoon of the 14th, the Chengdu battle had stopped, and Deng Xihou came forward to mediate again. The 24th Army ceded the arsenal to the 29th Army, and the Tian army also stopped military action. However, it is unknown whether Tian and Liu can get along to the end. (December 5)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhennian's Division is About to Arrive in Fujian</h3>
<p>Liu Expresses Obedience to the Fujian Authorities</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The 21st Division of Liu Zhennian has been transferred from Jiaodong to the border between Fujian and Zhejiang. The second brigade of the division's first batch, led by Liang Lizhu, arrived at the border between Fujian and Zhejiang on the 5th. The advance troops have advanced to the two counties of Pucheng and Zhenghe. The artillery, engineering, and baggage regiments and battalions of the second batch also arrived in Lishui and Longquan on the 7th and continued to advance. On the 9th, the provincial government received a telegram from Sun Yi, the magistrate of Pucheng County, stating, "Liu's division will arrive in Pu soon. It has been found that Zhejiang Province has a heavy burden of entertainment, and Lu banknotes are not in general circulation. The county of Zhi has been devastated after the disaster, and there is no way to raise military expenses. The military needs of the Qian brigade (i.e., the provincial defense army Qian Yuguang brigade) are particularly urgent these days. How should it be handled? Please telegraph instructions immediately." The provincial government, considering that county governments have recently been making excuses for handling military expenses, and have been advancing funds without permission, telegraphed the county magistrate, requiring him to report the arrival of Liu's troops in advance and not to advance funds without authorization. As for the supply of the Qian brigade, it will be raised separately. Furthermore, Liu Zhennian, considering that it was necessary to contact the provincial authorities as his troops would arrive in Fujian soon, specially sent Colonel Han Meicen, a counselor, to Fujian on the 11th to state to the provincial government and the Pacification Commissioner that his troops were coming to Fujian to suppress bandits in accordance with the order, would absolutely obey the command and dispatch of the authorities, and would cooperate effectively with various troops. However, most of the officers and soldiers of the division are from the north, and they are new to the south, and there are inevitably differences in customs and language. It is hoped that guidance will be given. (December 12)</p>
<h3>The Inspection Group from Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai Returns to Hankou</h3>
<p>Land Barren and Desolate, A Heartrending Sight</p>
<p>Numerous Disaster Victims Urgently Awaiting Relief</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: The inspection group from Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai, having departed from Hankou a few days ago to inspect the central Hubei region, passing through Yingcheng, Zaoshi, Tianmen, Yuekou, Zhangjiegang, Shayang, Jingzhou, Shashi Xindi, and entering Honghu, Xiaoshakou, Qujiawan, Fengkou, and Xiaogang, returned to Xindi on the 15th. Additionally, the Wuhan community's new inspection group for the recovered bandit areas also inspected the central Hubei region, passing through Yingcheng, Hanchuan, Tianmen, Qianjiang, Mianyang, and Jianli counties, arriving at Xindi from Fengkou on the 13th. After the inspection groups gathered in Xindi, they separately boarded steamships and returned to Hankou. The three inspection groups from Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai boarded the Sanjiang ship together, while the Wuhan inspection group traveled on the Taifeng ship alone. On the 16th at 6 PM, everyone arrived in Hankou. According to the observations made by a member of the group, the following points were noted: (1) The people's livelihood is dire. Houses are dilapidated, and land is barren everywhere. Residents in the cities eat grains, water chestnuts, wild water chestnuts, and other things. Farmers in the villages dig up wild grasses to eat and steam flour from water chestnuts and wild water chestnuts to make steamed buns to stave off hunger. The tragic situation is heartrending. Mianyang County is the most devastated, with approximately eight-tenths of the houses destroyed, half by bandits and half by soldiers. There is a lack of oxen, farming tools, and seeds everywhere. (2) Communist Party remnants are lurking. Although the main forces of the Communist bandits have been suppressed everywhere, remnants inevitably remain in hiding. A large number of Communist Party members have surrendered themselves. If no measures are taken to provide relief to the disaster victims, public security will be greatly threatened. (3) The Honghu Dike. This dike is where the lives and property of the people of Mianyang, Jianli, and Qianjiang counties are entrusted. It has not been repaired for several years, and much of it has collapsed, urgently requiring repair. (4) Local Order. Public security in various places is maintained by the Tenth Army. There are also organizations of defense corps and anti-Communist volunteer armies. Order is very stable, and displaced people are returning one after another. (5) Military Discipline. In the past, the discipline of the stationed troops was often poor, and there were reports of various acts of oppression against the people. The troops of the Tenth Army currently stationed have relatively strict discipline and have good relations with the people. (December 16th)</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<h3>Confessions of Bank Robbers</h3>
<p>After the suspects in the Songjiang branch robbery of the Xingye Bank, Niu Jinpu and others, were escorted back to Songjiang, the county Public Security Bureau conducted an interrogation. The confessions of informants and suspects are summarized below: (1) Jin Yunxiu's confession: 36 years old, from Quanjiao County, Anhui, doing small business. In early September, I met Tong Liwen and an unknown person at the small vegetable market in the French Concession. Tong introduced Sun Haiquan to my house for dinner. The second time, we went to a teahouse for tea. Tong asked me who had money, and when I didn't answer, they scolded me for not being a good friend. Sun said that they even dared to rob the Songjiang bank, so why should they be afraid of this? Later, they robbed No. 8, Meihua Lane, on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. I was afraid of being falsely accused, so I reported it to the police. After Niu Jinpu was arrested, Zheng Shaobo and Li Yinghan were arrested at Sun Haiquan's house. (1) Qian Kaijun, 38 years old, from Chaoxian County, Anhui. I have a relative, Ma Chaoding, who is a messenger in the Special Service Company of the Independent Brigade of the 88th Division, stationed in Songjiang. After working with Niu, I heard Ma Chaojun say that the Xingye Bank robbery was done by Niu Jinpu and others. After the bank robbery, Niu lived in a Western-style house in Wende Lane on Avenue Joffre and married a Cantonese actress for 800 yuan, but ran away in less than a week. Liu Zhiqing guarded the back door when Niu committed this crime, and Niu Jinpu guarded the Longmen. Now, Ji Yiming has been sentenced to four years and six months in Shanghai for robbing him. If this person can be caught, the case can be clarified. (1) Niu Guo's confession: from Hefei, Anhui. The Xingye robbery was done by Liu Tanqing, Ji Yiming, Chen Penghai, and others. On the 22nd day of the fifth lunar month, they divided the spoils at my house, 1,600 yuan per share. Ji, Wu, and Chen each received two shares because they had pistols, and my husband, Jinpu, received one share. Because I had a quarrel with my husband, he gave me 600 yuan. I went back to Hefei with Sun Haiquan, but the boat was robbed at Huoxikou. I returned to Shanghai, etc. (1) Niu Jinpu was a lieutenant platoon leader in the 88th Division. The Xingye robbery was robbed by Liu Zhiqing, Ji Yiming, Wu Dawei, and Chen Penghai. I put the money and tickets in a rattan basket, and I got 1,500 yuan. I told my wife to take 600 yuan back to Hefei. Now Ji Yiming has been arrested on Avenue Edouard and sentenced to four years and six months of imprisonment. The money I got has been gradually spent. (1) Ying Han and Zheng Shaobo confessed together that they had been soldiers in the 88th Division and were dismissed. They were doing small business in Shanghai. This time, I went to Sun Haiquan's place to see, but I was arrested in the bank robbery, which had nothing to do with me. (1) Shao's confession: I know Sun Haiquan, but I really don't know about the robbery. (1) Sun Haiquan's confession: I used to be a soldier in the 88th Division, first teacher Niu Jinpu, I got 1,600 yuan from the bank robbery, and then I ordered the teacher's wife to return to Anhui with me. After encountering robbers at Huoxikou and robbing the rattan basket of banknotes, I returned to Shanghai. Now Ji Yiming has been sentenced in Shanghai and is still appealing, so he has not been brought back. The county Public Security Bureau has escorted the suspects to the procuratorate for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>Agricultural Bank's Measures to Relieve Farmers</h3>
<p>The Farmers Bank of the Seventh District of this county, because of the local famine and after the war, the farmers' economy is full of holes and sores. The value of cotton and rice is low. If they are sold at a low price, the loss will be great. Therefore, it specially handles mortgage loans for agricultural products. Any farmer who wants to borrow money from the bank only needs to unite 10 to 30 people to form a credit production association, provide a guarantee, and ask the township head and district head to prove it. Rice and cotton can be used as collateral for loans. White rice is mortgaged for five yuan per stone, and cotton is mortgaged for ten yuan per dan. The interest rate is 9.8% per month. In addition, the mortgaged goods do not need to be deposited in the bank, but only need to be stored in the office of the director of the credit production association, which is jointly responsible for safekeeping by the director of the association. The procedures are simple and convenient for farmers.</p>

<h3>Party Headquarters Thoroughly Investigates District Chief's Accusation</h3>
<p>The county party headquarters held its 51st committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Xu Yongji. The following is a summary of the key cases resolved: (1) Committee member Gui Wochen reported that he was appointed to investigate the situation of Li Yaoting and others successively accusing the fifth district chief Zhu Chenghong of electoral fraud and covering up property grabbing and destroying evidence. He should write to the county government for investigation. (2) Guangqin Fifth Branch Road Qingfeng Yarn Factory's illegal construction destroyed the road. A letter should be sent to the county government to instruct the Construction Bureau to handle it. (3) Responding to the Shanghai County Party Headquarters, a telegram was sent to the central government to quickly correct the abolition of the Industry Department in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<h3>New Measures to Relieve Farmers</h3>
<p>The Farmers Bank, in order to relieve farmers from low grain prices and circulate the rural economy, opened public warehouses to lend and mortgage agricultural products. Warehouses have been set up in five places in the countryside. However, recently, in order to provide universal relief and enable farmers to benefit, special changes have been made to the measures, changing to a limit of 40 stones of white rice per person, with a limit of 200 silver dollars. Farmers can fill in the certificates themselves without the need for others to guarantee them. However, according to regulations, paddy rice and brown rice cannot be mortgaged. The Anzhen storage warehouse has been repeatedly requested by local people, and it has been agreed to discount the market value. The Farmers Bank has approved the change and will implement it soon.</p>
<h3>Baitangwei Almost Becomes a Den of Thieves</h3>
<p>Baitangwei in the northern countryside borders the Tianshang, Wan'an, and Qingcheng districts. The river surface is vast and the land is remote. It has always been a den of bandits. Later, the water police district sent patrol boats to station there, and it was slightly calmed down. Since the reform of the water police system in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the garrison has been cancelled. Robberies have been frequent in recent years, and few have been solved. Since autumn this year, there have been no less than 20 robberies of boats and flights. Travelers all regard it as a fearful place. A few days ago, a farmer surnamed Li from Yangjiawei hired a boat to return rent rice to the city. While passing through it, four bandits opened fire and robbed him, taking away clothes, rice, and foreign money worth about 40 yuan. In addition, a guest from Doumen, surnamed Hong, and a farmer surnamed Cai from Taixiang were also robbed in the dike. Because the losses were still small, they did not report to the county.</p>

<h3>Disputes Arise from Jealousy Among Competitors</h3>
<p>Recently, Tiantian Store in Shanxiang, this port, has been transporting and selling silk cloth parts, adhering to the principle of small profits, and for a time, customers gathered and the door was crowded. Because of the development of its business, it was envied by the Taiyuanchang Cloth Store next door, so it also held a big sale, posted slogans, and promoted it vigorously. Cloth stalls were set up on the street next to the store, and the shop assistants were sent out to shout loudly, attracting the attention of passers-by. At about 5:00 p.m. yesterday, the two stores clashed because of jealousy. The employees of the two stores each defended one side and staged a martial arts drama. The two shop assistants of Taiyuanchang threw the cloth stalls and the cloth pieces on the counter of Tiantian Store on the ground. For a time, pedestrians stopped, and the viewers blocked the road, and traffic was cut off. Later, the police of the section brought all the shop assistants of both sides to the second branch of the third bureau. It is reported that the owner of Taiyuanchang, Jin Nuoyan, died suddenly at 1:00 a.m. this morning because of his anger.</p>

Ye has two daughters, one four years old and one one year old. At 8:00 a.m. yesterday, Ye's nanny started a fire while frying eggs with a kerosene lamp, and a fire broke out, burning a garden and a corridor. Ye's four-year-old daughter was burned to death because she did not escape in time. The nanny was severely burned, and the president of Jiang was injured in the head. The losses were huge.</p>

<h3>Wang Baohe's Wine Boat Robbed by Pirates</h3>
<p>Shanghai Wang Baohe Liquor was judged to be from Shanghai Wang Baohe Liquor Store. A few days ago, I purchased more than 800 coins of Shaoxing wine from Shaoxing. The boat was hired by Shaoxing Xiangxing Transportation Company to transport it. When the wine boat sailed to Jinshan Yangmian, it was robbed by bandits and the boat was taken away. The company received a letter from the bandits yesterday, instructing them to send someone to Jiangkeao in Taiwan to contact Wang Renlao, etc.</p>

<h3>The County Party Headquarters Thoroughly Investigates the Zhapu Mountain Land Case</h3>
<p>Since the Provincial Highway Bureau temporarily designated Caizhuang Port in Zhapu as a shelter area and started surveying, no one has paid attention to the barren mountains, and the value has soared suddenly. Shanghai real estate agents have entrusted people to purchase them. Some time ago, it was rumored that Hangzhou Mayor Zhao Zhiyou also bought a large number of them. However, the owners of the mountain land have been buying and selling each other over the years, relying only on a piece of white paper contract, without proper contracts, so there has been a big dispute. The county party headquarters heard about it and has presented it to the provincial party headquarters to forward it to the central government to send personnel to investigate thoroughly to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3>Bandit Den Cracked, Ransom Rescued</h3>
<p>The police of the Seventh Branch of the Shaoxing Public Security Bureau, together with the Linpu Water Police Team, the County Basic Team, and the police of the Zhuji Public Security Bureau, yesterday co-operated in hunting down the bandits involved in the kidnapping of Tu Zubei in the Siguazhan Liangting area. When the bandits saw that the situation was not good, they opened fire and resisted. One bandit was shot and killed on the spot, and one was captured. The remaining bandits escaped. According to the captured bandit, named Zhang Ajiang, from Xiabandi, Linpu, the fortune of the person kidnapped, Ge A-jian, was hidden in the Shantoubu Village. The police went to that place and arrested Ge A-jian, who confessed that the ransom was in Xiangshu Township. They went to the township and arrested another bandit, Ge Chenglin, and rescued the ransom victim, Tu Xiaxian, and brought them all to the office for verification.</p>

<h3>Help Wang Delin Who Is Bitterly Fighting Against Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>The Lofty Spirit of Killing Enemies, Unyielding and Unyielding</p>
<p>Scolding Thieves Relieves Pain, Laudable and Moving</p>
<h3>General Zhu Sends Representatives to Shanghai to Beg for Assistance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from Liang Yuanshan and Zhang Chuyu, representatives of Wang Delin, yesterday, enclosing a copy of an urgent telegram from Dongning, and requesting assistance.</p>
<p>The attachment stated: "Received a package from Suifenhe transferred from Dongning": Since the disintegration of the Soviet army in the North Sea, the Japanese invaders' ambition to wipe out the volunteer army has become rampant. Because Wang (Delin)'s troops disrupted the railway track plan, in order to disturb the rear support, all the work is the most powerful. Therefore, the Japanese army's tense attack on Wang's troops has the momentum to wipe out everything. The large-scale pressure is becoming more and more urgent, and Wang's troops' lofty spirit of killing the enemy has never been unyielding. In the struggle to advance into Jilin and Changchun, they have also been actively resisting, regardless of sacrifice. However, the weather is severely cold, the clothes are thin, and the bullets are few. Every time there is a fierce battle between the two sides, they all sleep in the open air, drinking snow and lying on ice, using branches as nests and straw as bedding. Those who give their lives to the battlefield are pitiful and commendable, while those who are wounded and waiting for treatment have neither good doctors to treat them nor good medicines to save them. They are rotten and swollen, and the pus and blood are dripping. Most of them use scolding thieves as a way to relieve pain. This kind of tragic situation is really unbearable to hear and unbearable to see. The enemy relies on artillery fire, and we rely on spirit. The disparity between strength and weakness is extremely worrying. How should we quickly provide assistance so that Wang's troops can survive the severe winter and avoid danger? It is up to our compatriots across the country to make practical arrangements and not delay any longer. The war situation in the next few days will be continuously reported."</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the association immediately submitted it to the 87th executive committee meeting for discussion, which resolved to allocate another 10,000 yuan for relief.</p>
<p>General Zhu Ziqiao, in order to help Wang Delin, the anti-Japanese hero in Northeast China, specially sent Wang's representative Liang Detang to Shanghai to contact the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association for assistance.</p>
<p>Zhu also sent a letter to the association, saying that Commander Wang Delin led his troops to revolt and bravely killed the enemy. The facts are known to the world. The troops have more than 70,000 people, and the clothing and supplies are extremely difficult. Commander Wang has been raising funds on his own and with donations from all parties to barely support them until today. More than half of the officers lack winter clothes, weaving grass into shoes, and folding quilts into clothes. The plight is indescribable. The army is located in the key hub of the three provinces, and the relationship is extremely important. After the Soviet army's defeat, the defense area has become even more tense. It is urgent to find a way to provide relief to avoid being taken advantage of by the enemy. It is now planned to calculate based on 30,000 people, with each person's clothing, hats, shoes, socks, and other expenses costing seven yuan, totaling 210,000 yuan. This is the lowest limit. Please find a way to raise funds and issue them in advance. The matter is of utmost importance. I specially sent Wang Delin's representative Liang Detang to come forward to ask for instructions and report everything. Please contact and handle it. I can't help but pray, etc.</p>
<h3>Song Qingling and Others Initiate the China League for Civil Rights</h3>
<p>Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Quan, Li Zhaohuan, Lin Yutang, and others initiated the organization of the China League for Civil Rights, and issued a declaration, saying, "It is most regrettable that the civil rights demanded by the Chinese people with revolutionary sacrifices have not yet been realized. Records of suppressing public opinion and illegal arrests and killings are almost commonplace in newspapers. Even young men and women are sometimes suspected of being political prisoners and are subjected to secret military trials. Even the minimum human right of public trial to seek civil rights defense from social public opinion is deprived. We deeply know that to effectively and fully reform this state, we must strive to transform the environment that produces this state. However, we also know that all advanced countries have world organizations to protect civil rights, led by Einstein, Gide, Dewey, Russell, and Rolland. The main purpose of this organization is to protect the freedom of thought and social freedom necessary for human life and social evolution. For the same reason, we propose the organization of the China League for Civil Rights. The purpose of this league is: (1) To fight for the release of domestic political prisoners and the abolition of illegal detention, torture, and killings. This league is willing to first devote itself to the majority of nameless and socially unnoticed prisoners. (2) To provide domestic political prisoners with legal and other assistance, and to investigate prison conditions and publish facts about domestic oppression of civil rights in order to arouse social public opinion. (3) To assist all struggles for freedom of association, assembly, speech, press, and other civil rights. This league will establish a national committee, which will be chaired by an executive committee of five to seven people. The national committee will be composed of two representatives elected by each branch. It will meet once a year to elect executive committee members and discuss league affairs. The executive committee will serve for a term of one year and will have a chairman and several secretaries. This league will establish a general headquarters in Shanghai and branches in major cities in the country. Each branch will meet at least once a month. The branch representatives of the national committee will report the branch's situation to the executive committee every month. Anyone who agrees with the league's propositions and is willing to engage in the practical work of realizing these propositions, regardless of nationality, gender, or political beliefs, may become a member of this league upon introduction by three members and approval by a majority of the executive committee. The executive committee may refuse to join the league to candidate members who have participated in the past in acts of depriving civil rights. The membership fee of this league is three yuan per year for individual members and ten yuan per year for group members, and donations may be raised to maintain league affairs. Preparatory Committee of the China League for Civil Rights: Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Quan, Li Zhaohuan, Lin Yutang, et al.</p>
<p>China League for Civil Rights</p>
<h3>Telegram for the Rescue of Xu Deheng and Others</h3>
<p>The China League for Civil Rights sent a telegram to the authorities in Beiping and Nanjing, saying, "Mr. Chiang Kai-shek, Standing Committee Member of the Central Political Conference in Nanjing, Mr. Song Ziwen, Acting President of the Executive Yuan, and Mr. Yu Xuezhong, Commander of the Beiping-Tianjin Garrison, with respect. Reports state that police detectives in Beiping illegally arrested and imprisoned professors and students from various schools, including Xu Deheng and others, and have not released them to this day. This is the worst kind of destruction of the rule of law and trampling on civil rights. In recent years, the national situation has declined, and the morale of the people has been depressed, all because civil rights have not been established. When people are at home, they are afraid of not being able to guarantee their lives. How can they inspire the spirit of fighting against the enemy? If we want the whole country to unite sincerely and face the national crisis together, the government must immediately issue an order to the whole country to protect the people's freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, and belief, strictly prohibit the illegal detention of people and the censorship of news, and immediately release the teachers and students of schools illegally detained in Beiping, including Xu Deheng, in order to value civil rights and promote justice. Song Qingling, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Quan, Li Zhaohuan, Lin Yutang, and others, Preparatory Committee of the China League for Civil Rights, jointly launched on December 17th.</p>

<p>National Joint Association for National Salvation</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Celebration of the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between China and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>The National Goods Association Sends Telegram to Thank Soviet Russia</p>
<p>The National Joint Association of National Salvation Groups held a celebration meeting at 9:00 a.m. yesterday for the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union. More than 200 people attended, including Long Xiangsan, Zhang Junguang, Tu Liang, Zuo Hua, Chen Zhenquan, and Ma Zhiying. Zhang Junguang was elected chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Tu Liang, the secretary-general of the association, explained the significance of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union. Then, it was unanimously resolved to send a telegram to Soviet Russia to express their joy. The meeting ended at about 11:00 a.m. The telegram to the Soviet Union is recorded as follows: "To the Soviet Russian government and all the Russian people in Moscow, with respect. Unfortunately, our country has been invaded and massacred by Japanese imperialism. Since the September 18th Incident last year and the January 28th Incident this year, our entire Chinese people have been risking their lives to fight against Japan every day. However, in this difficult environment, seeking liberation is no easy task. Your country is a revolutionary country and takes helping small and weak nations as its responsibility. You should have deep sympathy for our country's misfortune. This time, the Japanese imperialists forcibly occupied our three northeastern provinces, and those who suffered the most have been clearly revealed, and the disadvantage to your country is also an undeniable fact. Therefore, China and Russia are countries that share weal and woe. If we want to ensure peace in East Asia and the survival of both countries, we must unite and fight together. We are grateful for the preferential treatment given to General Su Bingwen. From the beginning of the establishment of our association, we advocated restoring diplomatic relations between China and the Soviet Union and working together for justice to eliminate violence. Now that the governments of the two countries have officially announced the resumption of diplomatic relations, our association is overjoyed to hear this and held a celebration meeting. We hope that your country and the people will treat each other with sincerity and unite closely and fight together with us. The future of both countries will benefit from this."</p>
<p>The Joint Association of National Goods Factories in this city also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, requesting them to convey it to the Soviet Russian government in Moscow to express their gratitude. The original text is as follows: (Omitted above) "This time, General Su Bingwen of our country worked hard to resist Japan, but retreated into your territory due to lack of ammunition and support. The Japanese are insidious and treacherous and demanded extradition. Your country has strictly adhered to neutrality and upheld justice, which is a sign of great public spirit. As the resumption of diplomatic relations is just beginning, we hope to send ambassadors to each other to negotiate treaties and resolve county cases, so that the two major countries on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean can enhance friendship and maintain peace forever. Special telegram to express our gratitude. Please approve. Shanghai National Goods Factory Joint Association."</p>
<p>Volunteer Army Support Association Sends Telegrams to the Chinese and Soviet Governments</p>
<h3>Regarding the Expression of Sino-Russian Re-establishment of Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>Fully Opening a New Era of Automatic Diplomacy, a Bright Future is Emerging, Real Peace on the West Coast of the Pacific, Both Nations Can Shoulder the Mission. Since the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the national public has expressed sympathy. Yesterday, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association of this city sent a telegram to the central government to express its gratification, and also telegraphed the Soviet Russian government, hoping to work together in the spirit of equality and mutual assistance. The two telegrams are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>(Telegram to the National Government) Respectfully to the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Our country's diplomacy has always been observing the intentions of the great powers and has been unable to act independently, often delaying and making mistakes, causing endless harm. In the past, due to policy relations, diplomatic relations between China and Russia were severed, resulting in isolation and lack of assistance. The current national crisis of strong neighbors pressing the border began with this. This time, the government authorities clearly distinguished the relationship between international enemies and friends, established new diplomatic rules, resolutely restored the old good relations, and the great powers were stunned on the day of the announcement, and the whole country sympathized. This is the measure that our independent Republic of China should have, and it is also enough to open a new era of self-persuasion diplomacy. Our association is determined to assist the Northeast Volunteer Army. For half a year, we have deeply understood the difficult situation of the Volunteer Army. It is difficult to find complete success without transforming the environment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have this good opportunity now, and a bright future has emerged. It is easier to struggle and achieve results. It is hoped that the government authorities will consider the more than 30 million dying compatriots and the 4 million miles of lost territory, and quickly determine a self-help policy to respond to this newly created environment. We respectfully telegraph our gratification and look forward to working hard for the country. Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, Standing Directors: Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yin Zhufu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huanzheng, Yan Zhifang, Li Shaochuan, Chen Yafu, etc. kowtow together.</p>
<p>(Telegram to the Soviet Russian Government) Respectfully to the Russian Embassy in Beiping for translation and transfer to the Soviet Russian Government: China and the Soviet Union are neighbors and have always maintained friendly relations. Unfortunately, in the past, diplomatic relations were interrupted, but not only did commercial relations between the people not stop, but they continued to progress. Your country has completed the Five-Year Plan with the spirit of revolutionary construction. In today's world economic recession, it is uniquely able to manage with ease and is not controlled by the environment. Looking around the world, our admiration is extreme. Recently, General Su Bingwen led his troops to retreat into your country, and you have graciously accommodated and treated them favorably. You have also held firm to justice and rejected Japan's unreasonable demands, which is deeply appreciated. This time, our two governments resolutely restored diplomatic relations and exchanged envoys, and our people are inexplicably gratified. From now on, the two trades will surely make rapid progress, and the benefits to the people of both countries will be endless. Moreover, your country's completed national economic construction is enough to help our country learn from others. To seek the welfare of the people, we can go by different paths and achieve the same goal. We also hope that our two great nations will work together in the spirit of equality and mutual assistance to strive for the peace and order of the Far East. We firmly believe that the actual peace on the west coast of the Pacific can only be shouldered by our two countries, China and the Soviet Union. We hereby send this telegram to express our thoughts and respectfully wish all the people of your country boundless happiness. Republic of China Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, Standing Directors: Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yin Zhufu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huanzheng, Yan Zhifang, Li Shaochuan, Chen Yafu, kowtow together.</p>

<p>Navy Demands Repair Fees for Ships</p>
<h3>Misunderstanding Occurs on the Fuhai Patrol Ship</h3>
<p>Armed Navy Sails to the Ship to Demand Payment</p>
<p>Fuhai Soldiers Fire Live Ammunition as a Demonstration</p>
<p>The Zhejiang District Marine Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry entrusted the Fuhai patrol ship of the bureau to the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Ministry of Navy for repairs last year. Yesterday at 1:00 p.m., the naval authorities, because the ship had accumulated repair fees that had not been paid, sent special personnel accompanied by guards to the ship to demand payment. At the same time, the Fuhai patrol ship also believed that the Fisheries Administration owed soldiers' salaries for five and a half months, and their lives could not be maintained. Seeing the navy fully armed and in a turbulent situation, they thought they were going to confiscate their weapons, so they fired a shot of live ammunition into the water as a demonstration. At the same time, they ordered special security and refused to allow boarding. The naval side was afraid of causing trouble, so they left immediately and waited for negotiations. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<h3>Entrusting Repair of Patrol Ship</h3>
<p>The Fisheries Administration has a Fuhai patrol ship, which specializes in patrolling and protecting fishing boats in areas such as Wenzhou and Taizhou. Previously, due to damage to the hull, it was entrusted to the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Ministry of Navy for repairs last year. It has accumulated more than 20,000 yuan in repair fees. Personnel have been sent to the bureau many times to collect the money, but due to the bureau's financial difficulties, successive directors have been unable to pay it off and have delayed until now, still not paid in full.</p>
<h3>Navy Demands Payment</h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard believes that it is wrong for the bureau to not return the owed money for a long time, and the shipyard itself has also felt financially strapped in recent years. Therefore, yesterday at 1:00 p.m., the Naval First Fleet Command sent Wang Wenbo, platoon leader of the first platoon of the third company of the Naval Guard Battalion, and Liu Zhaopu, platoon leader of the third platoon, leading more than 20 guards, on the Jiangnan and Jiangkang small launches of the Naval Water Patrol Team to the Fuhai patrol ship to demand the owed payment.</p>
<h3>Misunderstanding Occurs</h3>
<p>The Fisheries Administration's current fishery protection patrol ships docked in this port include the Fuhai and Haiying, both docked in the Huangpu River at Guanhua Bridge in Nanshi. When the Jiangnan and Jiangkang small launches carrying Wang and Liu, the two platoon leaders of the Navy, arrived at the Fuhai patrol ship at about 2:00 p.m., about ten feet apart, Platoon Leader Wang stood up from the cabin of the Jiangnan launch, intending to explain the purpose of their visit to the personnel of the Fuhai patrol ship, but unfortunately, a misunderstanding occurred.</p>
<h3>Firing One Shot</h3>
<p>At that time, the Fuhai patrol ship misunderstood the intention and fired a shot of live ammunition into the water as a demonstration with a Mauser pistol. At the same time, the machine gun cover at the bow of the ship was removed, and serious precautions were taken to prevent naval soldiers from boarding. At the same time, Wang and Liu, the two platoon leaders of the Navy, were afraid that the situation would escalate, and that the Pujiang River was a major thoroughfare for merchant ships, and the Nisshin Company also had three ships docked nearby. A slight carelessness could lead to diplomatic disputes. Therefore, they waved to signal the Hai'an ship, and at the same time restrained the guards, not allowing them to retaliate. After a stalemate of about ten minutes, the two small naval launches sailed away, temporarily docked at the nearby Datong Wharf, and quickly reported to Ye Baoqi, the battalion commander of the Naval Guard Battalion, and forwarded it to Commander Chen Jiliang for review.</p>
<h3>Ye's Remarks</h3>
<p>After the incident, this reporter made a special trip to meet with Ye Baoqi, the battalion commander of the Naval Guard Battalion. According to his remarks, today he was ordered by the commander to send Wang and Liu, the two platoon leaders, to lead the guards on small launches to the Fuhai patrol ship to discuss official business. Unexpectedly, as soon as the two small launches sailed close to the ship, the ship fired live ammunition without asking the reason, hitting the outside of the engine room of the Jiangnan launch. It then tried to fire a machine gun. The situation at that time was incomprehensible. Fortunately, the guards under his command were still aware of the overall situation and did not retaliate, otherwise the traffic would be heavy in that area, and the consequences would be unimaginable. After checking, the officers and soldiers of this army, no matter where they go, or to foreign warships, can pass with guards. However, the ship fired live ammunition immediately without asking about the situation, which is really strange. The situation has now been reported to the command, and we will wait for the command's orders to deal with it, he said.</p>
<h3>Fuhai's Reasons</h3>
<p>This newspaper reporter went to Datong Wharf in Nanshi at 10:00 p.m. last night to investigate. The two small naval launches were no longer there. He then took a sampan to the Fuhai patrol ship docked in the Pujiang River to inquire. When approaching, the Fuhai soldiers questioned with guns, and the situation was indeed extremely serious. According to the soldiers, the captain of the Fuhai ship is Guo Wei, and there are more than fifty soldiers. The Fisheries Bureau has owed wages for five and a half months, and the soldiers' lives are really unsustainable. This afternoon (that is, yesterday), the navy drove two small launches close, and the situation was turbulent, ordering this ship to lower the flag. We thought that because the arrears were not paid, they still wanted to take the opportunity to come on board and confiscate our weapons. For self-defense, we fired a shot of live ammunition into the water as a demonstration and did not allow them to board the ship. The navy had no choice but to sail away immediately. As for the payment collection, it should be directly contacted with the Fisheries Administration. How can there be any reason to negotiate with this ship?</p>
<h3>Xia Tengfei's Statement</h3>
<p>The Beiping Chang Tengfei telecommunications company stated to the Shen Bao News, Times News, and China News: Recently, I read in the Times News that I will definitely go to Shanghai on [day of the week] to participate in the Northeast Army Joint Communications Office and contact various parties for assistance, etc. After investigating, the joint communications office in Shanghai was originally the general agency for mutual communication between representatives of the various Volunteer Armies and has no other function. Moreover, all the supplies for our army are currently being handled by Chairman Cheng. I am staying in Beiping on official business and have not gone south. If there is any false atmosphere, I will not admit it. I am deeply afraid that rumors from afar are untrue, so I specially telegraph this statement. I hope you will take note of it.

<h3>Charity Association Joint Meeting Minutes</h3>
<p>Separate Acknowledgement of Calligraphy, Paintings, Antiques, and Lottery Tickets</p>
<p>Letter Asking About Hartung's Million-Dollar Charitable Donation</p>
<p>It's Cold and the Shelters Are Crowded</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Association held a temporary meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m. Those who attended were Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, and representatives from the Zanye Gongyi Association, Huazhong Shantang, Shanghai Orphanage, Hunan Charity Association, Lianyi Shan Society, Shenzhou Hospital, Shanghai Puji Shan Society, Guangyi Shantang, Relief Women's Society, Pushan Villa, Shanghai Disabled Persons' Home, Shanghai Hospital, Yimiao Board of Directors, Gongji Shantang, Fushan Hall, Renji Shantang, Renji Nursery, and other representatives, more than twenty people. Huang Hanzhi was publicly elected as chairman. 1) The chairman reported that the Shanghai Charity Association Joint Relief Northeast Refugee Association, the Lianyi Shan Society, is one of the organizations. Recently, major benefactors have donated a large number of calligraphy, paintings, antiques, and various items, which are very valuable. The Lianyi Shan Society is now printing lottery tickets, each ticket is ten yuan, that is, the aforementioned donations will be publicly drawn on January 9, 22 at the Lake Society. All the donations received will be used to aid</p>
<p>Northeast refugees. The Lianyi Shan Society sent 500 lottery tickets the day before yesterday, asking each charitable organization to distribute them as much as possible to maintain the good deed. It was decided that the Shanghai Charity Association would acknowledge and sell 40 lottery tickets, the Zanye Gongyi Association would acknowledge and sell 20 lottery tickets, the Renji Shantang would acknowledge and sell 20 lottery tickets, the Huisheng Charity Society would acknowledge and sell 20 lottery tickets, the Zhongsheng Shanyuan would acknowledge and sell 20 lottery tickets, the Yimiao Board of Directors would acknowledge and sell 10 lottery tickets, the Shenzhou Hospital would acknowledge and sell 10 lottery tickets, the Lianyi Shan Society would acknowledge and sell 10 lottery tickets, the Chinese Jisheng Society would acknowledge and sell 10 lottery tickets, the Tongyi Shanshan would acknowledge and sell 10 lottery tickets, the Shengde Shan Society would acknowledge and sell 10 lottery tickets, the Public Shanghai Hospital would acknowledge and sell 5 lottery tickets, the Relief Women's Society would acknowledge and sell 5 lottery tickets, the Gongjitang would acknowledge and sell 5 lottery tickets, the Guangyi Shantang would acknowledge and sell 5 lottery tickets, the Yuanji Shantang would acknowledge and sell 5 lottery tickets. These tickets must be sent to the association for compilation before the lottery draw. If the lottery tickets cannot be sold out, they must also be returned to the association before the lottery draw, and will not be returned after the deadline. Passed. 2) Wang Junsheng of Pushan Villa proposed that Mr. Xu Qianlin and Xie Hengchu reported last summer that Hartung had passed away and planned to withdraw one million from his estate and allocate it to various charitable organizations to specifically handle charitable undertakings. The association was consulted to invite various charitable organizations to prepare sacrifices and go to mourn. Now that more than a year has passed, there is no news about the appropriation. It is not worth arguing whether each charitable organization can obtain the money or not, but the current social situation is that there are more and more poor people and more and more unemployed people. If the Hartung family can sincerely withdraw huge sums of money, or specifically run a poor people's factory, or expand the existing local businesses separately to provide relief, it is also what the colleagues hope for. Should the case be urged and inquired? It was decided that the association would prepare a letter to inquire Mr. Lin and Hengchu and then consider the use of the appropriation amount. Passed. 3) The chairman reported that the temporary shelters run by the association opened the first shelter on the 10th of this month, at the Chaozhou Guild Hall in the South Railway Station, the second at the Dawang Temple on Dawangmiao Street, and the third at the Jiangxi Guild Hall on Xiaopudu Street. Recently, the weather has turned cold suddenly, and poor people have flocked in. Currently, more than 1,600 people have been accommodated, and each shelter is about to be full. We are looking for other houses to prepare for the fourth and fifth shelters. The shelters urgently need funds. It is hoped that the donations acknowledged by various groups in the last meeting will be handed in as soon as possible for expenditure.</p>
<p>China Merchants Bureau Recent News</p>

Two deputy auditors will also be announced soon. The general audit department has already been organized by Mr. Li yesterday.</p>
<h3>Zhen Floating Dock Bidding</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Lotus Pond floating dock, which has been occupied by the British trading company Jardine Matheson for a long time, has now been negotiated and recovered. For the convenience of upper and lower Yangtze River ships berthing, the Shipping Section has moved the bureau's Zhen dock to Lotus Pond. However, at the beginning of the relocation, the construction of all the square boats and the addition of the trestle bridge are huge projects. Section Chief Zhao Yuntai, in order to seek truth from facts, has specially invited bids for construction and has drafted the regulations and will announce the bidding soon.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Ship Resumes Service</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River ships of the bureau were suspended in late last month, and the difference was that they had been used for a full month, which inevitably affected business.

<p>China Merchants Bureau</p>
<h3>Shareholder Representatives Go to Beijing to Petition</h3>
<p>Request the Third Plenary Session to Revoke the Nationalization Original Case</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau Shareholders' Rights Maintenance Association believes that the government's nationalization of the bureau this time is in conflict with the Regulations on Supervision of Private Public Utilities promulgated in December of the 18th year of the Republic of China. Therefore, after a preparatory meeting, it was decided to send representatives to Beijing to submit a petition to the Third Plenary Session to revoke the original case in which the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation decided to take the China Merchants Bureau into state ownership. The representatives, Li Zhengwu, Li Cishan, Yu Gumin, and others, took the overnight express train to Beijing last night and will visit the central members today to request relief. The original presentation is recorded below: It is presented for the matter of petitioning. The case investigates the meeting of the Executive Yuan on November 8 this year, which was requested by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation to nationalize the China Merchants Bureau, reorganize the supervisory office into a board of directors, and establish a general manager. All stocks shall be taken into state ownership at a price of fifty taels of standard silver per set, determined by the average market price of the past three years, thirty taels, six qian, and six fen per set, etc., which was passed after deliberation and submitted to the Central Political Council for approval. Subsequently, the competent department sent personnel to take over the cases. We believe that the China Merchants Bureau is the largest private public utility in our country. Tracing its evolution, there have been changes, and the people's livelihood and navigation rights are of great importance. If the government needs to innovate, it should deliberate at length. Since it is under party rule, it should proceed according to law. The Regulations on Supervision of Private Public Utilities were promulgated in December of the 18th year of the Republic of China and have not been abolished. Item 5 of Article 2 of the same regulations states that shipping business is one of the public utilities. Article 14 also states that after a private public utility has been in operation for 30 years, the supervisory authority may collect it for public operation after preparing the price, but must notify one year in advance. Item 2 of the same article states that private public utilities established before the implementation of these regulations may be allowed to apply the preceding provisions after 30 years of implementation of these regulations and be collected for public operation. Article 15 also states that when a private public utility is collected for public operation, it shall be paid according to the total amount of its existing assets. The price assessed by the 〇 experts. Item 2 of the same article states that if there is any objection to the evaluation in the preceding paragraph, the court in the area shall send three members, and the local autonomous organization and the chamber of commerce shall each send two members to form an evaluation committee to examine and approve it, etc. The legislation is detailed, and China and foreign countries have everything. In this case, the competent departments handled the nationalization case of the China Merchants Bureau. After the administrative deliberation was passed, personnel were immediately sent to take over without considering the statutory time limit or giving prior notice. The oldest and largest private public utility was taken into state ownership within less than ten days. The pricing method is based on the average market price of the stock in the most recent three years, which is obviously contrary to the statutory regulations of assessing and paying according to the current assets. As for the personnel participating in the evaluation, what legal qualifications they have, there is no basis in law. According to the Regulations on Supervision of Private Public Utilities, it has not been three years since the promulgation. According to the regulations, the life of the China Merchants Bureau is still 27 years. According to the general practice of constitutional countries, orders cannot change the law. None of the administrative punishments imposed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation this time are in line with the legal text. I don't know where the dignity of the law and the credibility of the country are placed. Even in terms of facts and reasons, the total assets of the China Merchants Bureau are worth no less than 70 million taels, and the price offered by the authorities is less than 4% of the actual value of each share. How can it be fair? The public is panicked, and there is no way to get relief. The authorities are determined to innovate, and businessmen are happy to follow, but the prestige of the national law is concerned, and they dare not remain silent. I hope that the钧 Council will comprehensively consider the national economy and observe the people's livelihood. I dare to appeal based on the facts and ask the General Assembly to approve the revocation of the original case in which the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation decided to take the China Merchants Bureau into state ownership, and to handle it in accordance with the Regulations on Supervision of Private Public Utilities, so as to correct the administration on the right track and maintain the rule of law forever. Not only is it the fortune of the public, but it is also the glory of the party and the country. It is reasonable to petition based on the facts. I beg you to examine and implement it. This is presented to the Fourth Session of the Third Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. Petitioners: China Merchants Bureau Shareholder Representatives Li Zhengwu, Li Cishan, Yu Gumin.</p>
<p>Pengpu District</p>
<h3>Part of the Petition Representatives Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Representatives Remaining in Beijing Continue to Petition to the Administrative Supervision</p>
<p>All the villagers in Wangjiajing, Zhaojia Garden, Zhuxiang, and other villages in Pengpu District have repeatedly petitioned various party and government agencies because the Ministry of Railways' expropriation of the people's land there is detrimental to the people's livelihood, but to no avail. Therefore, on the morning of the 13th, more than ten villagers went to the Railway Bureau to request a car to go to Beijing, intending to petition the Third Plenary Session. Later, because the Railway Bureau prevented them from getting on the car, there was a disturbance. After Wen Hongen of the Public Security Bureau mediated, he gave ten people round-trip free tickets, and the rest bought their own tickets before it was resolved. At that time, thirty representatives, including Hou Xuanqing, Zhao Wenxiu, Zhao Zhixing, Hou Shizhang, Zhang Zhongxiang, etc., were elected and took a car to Beijing that night. They arrived in Beijing the next morning. Wu, the section chief of the Xiaguan Police Section, was ordered by Ma, the director of the Shanghai Police Department, to forcibly cancel the free tickets for returning to Shanghai. After several negotiations, there were no results. The representatives believed that since the free tickets were issued through the mediation of Director Wen, Director Ma unreasonably confiscated them, which was obviously intentional to make things difficult. They telegraphed Director Wen for relief. Later, they received a reply from Director Wen, saying that he had agreed with Director Chen and telegraphed the Xiaguan stationmaster to check. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Assembly Endorses</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 a.m. on the 15th, all the representatives carried submissions, declarations, maps, etc. to the Third Plenary Session to petition. Because the Third Plenary Session only held the opening ceremony that day and had already adjourned, and the Secretariat of the Assembly had not been established, there were no responsible personnel, so they left. At 12:00 noon, they hosted reporters from Beijing and Shanghai at the Jinlingchun Restaurant in Fuzimiao, asking for sympathy and assistance. On the 12th, the Executive Yuan had previously resolved that this case should be planned by the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Ministry of Industry in consultation with the Zhen Department. Therefore, they prepared a submission and went to the Ministry of Military Affairs at 9:00 a.m. to petition, requesting Minister He to find a way to provide relief. Li Shiquan of the Protocol Section met with them and promised to convey it to the minister and handle it impartially. At 10:00 a.m., they went to the Ministry of Industry to make the same request. Li Pingheng, the director of the Labor Division, met with them and promised to consult with the responsible personnel of the three departments to discuss a proper solution or send personnel to Shanghai to investigate the actual truth. At 11:00 a.m., they went to the Ministry of Interior. Secretary Chen met with them and said that he expressed sympathy for the intentions of the people. The Ministry of Interior mainly focuses on the urgent use of land expropriated from the people, and the large-scale plan in the future cannot be fully collected before application, causing heavy losses to the people, etc. At 3:00 p.m., they returned to the Third Plenary Session to petition. Ye Shizhi of the Secretariat met with the representatives Hou Xuanqing, Zhao Wenxiu, and Hou Shizhang, and told them that the Third Plenary Session had submitted this case to the Presidium. He was instructed by the chairman of the assembly to order the Executive Yuan to handle the case carefully and jointly, and also showed the endorsement of Ding Weifen and Ju Zheng, the chairman of the assembly that day. The representatives then left at about 4:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Some Representatives Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The representatives believed that the petition to the Third Plenary Session had temporarily come to an end. Therefore, some representatives, including Zhao Wenxiu, Tao Wenyuan, Zhao Zhixing, and Wang Futing, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning to report the progress. The representatives remaining in Beijing, Hou Xuanqing, Zhao Youting, Hou Shizhang, Zhang Zhongxiang, Tao Zhigang, etc., plan to petition the Executive Yuan and the Control Yuan again. It is heard that the villagers were outraged by Director Ma's unwarranted difficulty and have petitioned the Railway Department Administration to dismiss him and investigate him.</p>

<h3>Dragon Zhang Paper Mill Labor Strike Immediately Ceased</h3>
<p>Party and Government Persuasion Led to Resumption of Work Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Labor-Management Dispute Awaiting Mediation</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Long Zhang Paper Mill on Longhua Road is large-scale and employs over eight hundred male and female workers. The female rag pickers opposed the dismissal of workers and fines, and went on strike on the previous day. Yesterday, after persuasion from party and government agencies, they resumed work in the afternoon and await mediation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Going on Strike Together) About three hundred long-term and temporary workers in the rag-picking section of the Long Zhang Mill, when leaving work at 12:00 noon on the 15th, female worker number 141 refused to be inspected by the foreman, resulting in a dispute. After starting work at 1:00 p.m., the female worker clashed with the foreman again, causing minor injuries to both sides. The factory director immediately announced the dismissal of the female worker. On the 16th, all the female workers in the rag-picking section went on strike together. After being notified, the First District Paper Industry Union immediately advised the workers to resume work, but to no avail. The striking female workers put forward: 1) a request to reinstate worker number 141; 2) opposition to the factory's fines. The union believed that the extension of the strike in the rag-picking section would lead to a shortage of raw materials and that other departments would inevitably have to stop working as a result. It immediately petitioned the Municipal Party Department's Social Affairs Bureau for swift mediation.</p>
<p>(Persuasion to Resume Work) After being notified, the Municipal Party Department dispatched Zhao Erchang, a staff member of the Training Section, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, together with Zhu Guilin, a mediator from the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, to try to mediate the situation. They also summoned the union and the female workers to persuade them. As a result, all the female workers resumed work at the factory at 1:00 p.m. The issue of worker number 141 and the factory's fines will be settled by party and government agencies in accordance with the law. The striking female workers expressed their satisfaction, and work was fully resumed at 1:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Motor Company Declares Bankruptcy</h3>
<p>According to a Shen Shi Telegraph Agency local news report, the Huashang Shanghai South Public Motor Company, due to poor business, declared a temporary suspension of operations in September of this year and entrusted accountant Jiang Wanping to clear its accounts. It is now learned that accountant Jiang has completed the clearing and has submitted the clearing results, along with the balance sheet, to the Shanghai Local Court for a declaration of bankruptcy. He requested that bankruptcy trustees be appointed in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law Liquidation Regulations in order to begin auctioning off the remaining assets to repay creditors. It is reported that the company's total loss is more than 161,000 yuan, of which the remaining assets are valued at more than 100,000 yuan, leaving a balance of more than 60,000 yuan, which cannot be repaid because the shareholders have limited liability.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Jiangsu Province to Dredge the River Dams in Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce cabled the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction yesterday, requesting the dredging of the river dams in the Yunhe River in northern Jiangsu to maintain cargo transport. The original text reads: "To the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction: On the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Grain, Oilcake, and Noodle Industry Association wrote to inform us that according to letters from our fellow traders and distant branches, merchants in northern Jiangsu have reported that due to the prolonged drought, the water level in the Yunhe River is low, and the water near Ma Peng Bay is only a foot deep, making it impossible for cargo ships to pass up and down the river. More than 3,000 ships are stranded there, most of them carrying grain, with seafood, foreign goods, silk, satin, and wool accounting for about two-thirds. If no measures are taken to clear these stranded cargo ships, not only will the daily supply of rice for Shanghai be insufficient, but the shortage will also affect the circulation of money at the end of the year when the New Year is approaching. Moreover, the stranded goods may be subject to changes in market prices, spoilage of materials, or theft by shipowners. Such unexpected losses are inevitable. Currently, the only way to allow cargo ships to pass is to open the dams. Otherwise, the 3,000 cargo ships cannot fly to Shanghai. Not only will our grain merchants suffer this hardship, but all industries in Shanghai will also be affected. We urge you to forward this letter from the Grain Association to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting that the two departments of Jiangsu Civil Affairs and Construction allow the dams to be opened to release water to relieve commercial transportation and provide funds for circulation. It is reported that the goods and cargo previously stranded were worth about five to six million yuan, and were related to the cargo funds of various industries in Shanghai, such as grain, miscellaneous goods, seafood, foreign goods, silk, satin, and wool. Now, due to the shallow water in the Yunhe River, the goods are stranded, which is tantamount to stranding five to six million yuan of funds. At this time when the end of the year is approaching and funds are extremely tight, how will we raise funds for circulation? If we do not urgently take measures to open the river and allow passage, the more cargo ships gather, the more difficult it will be to circulate funds, and how will the cargo merchants survive this New Year? Therefore, we are informing you of the situation and respectfully request that you forward this letter to the two departments of Jiangsu Civil Affairs and Construction, urging them to open the dams immediately to allow the huge amount of stranded goods to pass, so as to relieve the commercial difficulties. We sincerely appreciate your public spirit.' Another newspaper report stated that representatives of the people in northern Jiangsu believed that the 10,000 boatmen were living in danger due to the stagnation of water and requested an announcement to all sectors of society. I deeply feel that with the end of the year approaching, if the river freezes, not only will the 10,000 boatmen be in dire straits, but the funds of Shanghai grain merchants and seafood, foreign goods, silk, satin, and wool industries will be even more difficult to circulate. We urgently inform you of the situation and enclose an advertisement, respectfully requesting your association to cable the Jiangsu Department of Construction to forward a telegram to the Northern Jiangsu Yunhe River Engineering Bureau to dredge the dams to create a lifeline and attach a newspaper advertisement from representatives of northern Jiangsu calling for signatures. Accordingly, the circulation of goods between Shanghai and various places in northern Jiangsu depends entirely on the Yunhe River. Now, due to the prolonged drought, the water near Ma Peng Bay is shallow, causing goods to be stranded. At the end of the year, when commercial funds are tight, the impact is indeed significant. It is now said that the only way to allow thousands of cargo ships to be transported is to dredge the dams. The competent authorities should promptly open the river to facilitate cargo transportation and relieve commercial difficulties.</p>
<p>Deeply appreciate your public spirit. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shang Xian, bows."</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Landing Force Holds Field Combat Exercises</h3>
<p>Atagoyama Arrives in the Yangtze River Yesterday</p>
<p>The more than seven hundred new recruits from the Japanese Ministry of the Navy who were transferred to Shanghai last month have been incorporated into four major teams by Commander Sugisaka and are undergoing intensified training. Yesterday at noon, Commander Sugisaka specially ordered the new soldiers to carry out field exercises, dividing the seven hundred new recruits into two major teams, one for attack and one for defense. Commander Sugisaka personally supervised, and Lieutenant Colonel Ohiso served as commander. They first held attack and defense operations in the eastern suburbs of Hongkou, first using infantry and then artillery. The exercise lasted about two hours. Afterwards, the defense team retreated to the vicinity of the Da Kang Textile Factory and practiced street fighting again. The sound of gunfire and artillery was frequent for a while, causing great panic among nearby residents. They returned to the team later. It is reported that a second large exercise will be held at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The flagship Atagoyama of the Japanese First Overseas Dispatch Force departed from Shanghai yesterday and headed to various ports along the Yangtze River to inspect the Japanese warships in various places. Commander Sakano took the ship to Wuhan.</p>
<h3>Check All Etc. To Song Ziwen Telegram</h3>
<p>Zha Liangzhao Quan Shaowu to Committee Chairman Song Telegram, Nanjing Executive Yuan to Committee Chairman Song, for your perusal, Liangzhao et al. were falsely accused by the Anhui Association of Shanghai in the Shanghai court for the Anhui disaster relief dispute, reversing right and wrong, and confusing the audience. The process of this matter has been examined by Liangcha colleagues, etc. It is clear that they are innocent and have no guilt in their hearts. Moreover, because the matter concerns the reputation of the association and disaster relief, they came to Shanghai from afar to respond to the lawsuit and filed a counterclaim, aiming to have the court determine the truth, uphold justice, maintain disaster relief, and correct people's hearts. Currently, the court hearing has been held four times. The legal representatives, lawyers, and witnesses of the Anhui Association of Shanghai have made many public slanders against the association, organizations, and Chinese and Western charitable people who organized disaster relief, launching indiscriminate attacks, and even falsely accusing the association's files of being unreliable. The disaster relief ticket stubs verified by the audit team were forged by disaster relief commissioners, and they even doubted the official receipts issued by the county government. Witnesses denied their own handwritten letters. Such blatant lies are clearly intended to slander and disrupt disaster relief. The association is a disaster relief agency of the National Government, how can it tolerate being slandered? I dare to ask the committee chairman to instruct the legal counsel of the association to attend the court hearing and pay attention to their public insults and false evidence, so as to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law and warn those who disrupt disaster relief. We urgently express our words and hope for your consideration. Zha Liangzhao, Director of the Disaster Relief Office, Quan Shaowu, Disaster Relief Commissioner of Northern Anhui, bows, Qian.</p>

<h3>Zhu Tieying Case Retried</h3>
<p>Resembles Stealing Chickens with a Great Deal of Official Air</p>
<p>These Eight Characters Are Considered Insulting</p>
<p>Zhu Tieying, the editor of the Moye Bao in Taicang, was accused of satirizing Director Hu Jiacong in a report on business tax matters. County Magistrate Zhao Enju arrested Zhu and immediately sentenced him to one year in prison for harming the interests of the Republic of China, and fined him 100 yuan for failing to make corrections, and closed the newspaper. Zhu appealed to the Shanghai Local Court, arguing that the judgment was illegal. After several trials, the debate ended. It was now announced that the business tax had been exempted, so there was no harm to the interests of the Republic of China. However, the words "resembles stealing chickens with a great deal of official air" in the newspaper were close to scolding and insulting. Therefore, the judgment revoked the original judgment, but sentenced Zhu to three months in prison for publicly insulting a public official, and fined him 100 yuan for failing to make corrections in the newspaper. However, Zhu did not express his satisfaction after the judgment and may appeal to the third instance.</p>

<h3>Inferior Goods Arrive in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Since October, the import of Japanese goods has been extremely crowded. Recently, Japanese merchants heard that China and Russia have resumed diplomatic relations, and Russian goods will be sold to China. They are now rushing to ship goods to Shanghai. Yesterday, the Asamaru arrived, carrying more than 18,600 pieces of inferior goods, mainly including piece goods, machinery parts, yarn factory supplies, porcelain, and sugar. Compared to the crowded period, the load has increased by one-third. On the 19th, 20th, 24th, 27th, and 30th of this month, there will be five more large batches of inferior goods, about 60,000 to 70,000 pieces, arriving in Shanghai by the end of this month on the Mikasayama, Tsukuba Maru, Rokkosan Maru, and Maya Maru.</p>
<h3>Knocking on Coffins to Ask for Flower Club Numbers</h3>
<p>Their Stupidity is Incomparable</p>
<p>Flower Clubs Abound in Pudong</p>
<p>Recently, the practice of betting on flower clubs has become very popular in the coastal areas of Pudong. Ordinary people are addicted to this practice, and they often ask ghosts and gods for flower club numbers. The Bao An Corps and the police station separately cracked two cases the night before last and yesterday. 1) Liu Nianbao, a 25-year-old from Gaoyou, who lives at No. 159 Yangjiadu, works as a boatman. The night before last, he gathered his friends to burn incense and candles in the tombs behind the Yangjing Temple in Lan Nidu to knock on coffins for numbers. He was spotted by Bao An Corps member Yang Bingkui and others, who sent Liu and a lottery tube to the Third District Police Station for processing.</p>
<p>2) Xiao Jingfu, the patrol officer of the Third Section of the Third District of Tangqiao, saw that there were many gamblers in the territory. Yesterday, he led the police to arrest Du Deko, Zhu Guisheng, and Xiang Shicheng in the San Guan Tang area, and confiscated a lottery tube and several slips of paper. He took everything to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Selection Method for Chinese Real Estate Committee Members in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>Each of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Real Estate Association will select one person. On April 13 of this year, at the annual meeting of foreign ratepayers in the Public Concession, a proposal was passed, believing that two Chinese committee members should be added to the Real Estate Committee. The Municipal Council was authorized to contact representatives of the relevant countries in order to increase the number of Chinese committee members. At that time, the United States also expressed a hope that the interests of non-landlord Chinese ratepayers should be protected during the selection process. Subsequently, in July, the Municipal Council sent a letter to the Senior Consul, requesting that the proposal and hope be conveyed to the Diplomatic Corps and that Article 6A of the Public Concession Real Estate Regulations be revised to clearly protect the interests of Chinese ratepayers. Recently, Mayor Wu sent a letter to the Senior Consul, explaining the selection of these committee members. After considering this letter, the Municipal Council decided to waive the requirement for Municipal Council approval of the selected committee members. However, in order to realize the expectations of the annual ratepayers' meeting, one of the two Chinese committee members should be selected by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and this person should be neither a landlord nor a representative of a landlord. The other member should be selected by the Chinese Real Estate Association. Originally, there were three foreign real estate committee members in the Public Concession. One was appointed by the Municipal Council, one was elected by registered landlords (concurrently with the election of directors), and one was elected by the annual ratepayers' meeting. Now, with the addition of Chinese committee members, there will be a total of five real estate committee members. The Real Estate Committee has the power to adjudicate disputes arising from the Municipal Council's acquisition of land.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiheng Receives Swedish National Medal</h3>
<p>The Swedish King bestows</p>
<p>Second Class Vasa Order</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Jiheng, Secretary of the Swedish Consulate General in Shanghai, native of Wuxian, Bachelor of Political Science from St. John's University in Shanghai, assumed his current position in 1922 and has served for ten years.

It is now reported that the Swedish King has specially awarded him the Second Class Vasa Order to commend him. The Swedish Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held a banquet at the Metropolitan Hotel on Sima Road the day before yesterday, where Acting Consul General Fei Shen personally presented the medal to Mr. Zhu, who received and wore it.</p>
<h3>Success of Charity Ball</h3>
<p>The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association held a charity ball at the Astor House Hotel last night. All proceeds from ticket sales will be used to subsidize the association's expenses. The enthusiastic participation of Chinese and Western ladies and gentlemen was unprecedented. After 9 o'clock, there was no space left on the dance floor. Prominent figures such as Zhang Gongquan, Huang Hanliang, and Wu Liande, and Yan Fuqing, all attended with their families. Li Yuanxin, Zhang Jiabu, Mrs. Xiao Zhiji, Wu Zhijian, Gao Sheqiang, Hua Junchao, Zhang Xianlun and others served as hosts. In addition to tea dances, there were also exquisite programs, among which Ms. Yu's solo, Mr. Wu and Ms. Yu's duet, the National Conservatory of Music's full chorus, "Where the Lotus Blooms," Ms. Madde's solo, and a certain Westerner's Charleston dance were particularly featured. Lottery tickets were also sold on the spot, and all prizes were donated by individuals or companies. There were a total of 20 major prizes, which were drawn in public that evening. Zhang Gongquan and Schode were invited to supervise. The first prize, a Chinese painting personally painted by Mrs. Jiang Yiping, was won by a certain French gentleman. The second and third prizes were painted fans by Mrs. Jiang. The fourth prize was a suit from Henry Tailor. The fifth prize was a gold watch from Henry &amp; Company.

<h3>Mechanic's Tragic Death</h3>
<p>At approximately 8:25 yesterday morning at the Fuxin Seventh Flour Mill on Xinzha Grand Road, a mechanic named Huang Jianfu, 48 years old, from Ningbo, was accidentally crushed by machinery, losing his right shoulder and both legs. Blood gushed out like a spring, and he lost consciousness. He was then transported by the fire brigade to Renji Hospital for treatment but died at 9:30.</p>
<h3>Old Woman Dies Tragically Next to Stove from Coal Poisoning</h3>
<p>Arms and Legs Burned</p>
<p>Beware of Burning Coal Balls</p>
<p>The woman Mao Yin, 62 years old, residing at 32 Xinzha Road, whose son, Mao Ading, works at the waterworks, closed all the windows tightly in the pavilion loft due to her old age and fear of the cold, and burned coal balls in the stove to keep warm at around 6 PM the day before yesterday, while Ading had not yet returned home. Unexpectedly, she fainted from the gas in an instant, causing her to fall next to the stove. The clothes on her body were also burned by the fire, and her arms and legs were also burned. When her son returned home from work and knocked on the door without response, he managed to pry the door open and saw this situation. He quickly extinguished the fire, and fortunately, it was discovered early, so the house was not severely affected. He then transported his mother to Guangren Hospital for medical treatment, but due to the fire's toxins attacking her heart, she could not be saved and soon died. The hospital notified the Xinzha police station, who ordered detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the forensic examination office on Follen Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District District Court, arrived at the office to conduct an examination. He was informed by the deceased's son, Mao Ading, of the previous situation. Mr. Guo then pronounced that Mao Yin had died from burns sustained during her life, and the body was handed over to her son, Mao Ading, to prepare for burial.</p>

<h3>Preliminary Announcement of Memorial Service for Ji Chuying</h3>
<p>Mr. Ji Chuying traveled to Europe and America in his early years, united with comrades, and promoted revolution. After returning to China, he traveled north and south, working tirelessly.

It is thought that Mr. Ji had extensive social connections during his lifetime, and it is expected that there will be a grand scene of mourning at that time.</p>
<h3>Liangyou Photographic Group on the Northwest Journey</h3>
<p>Recently Entered Shaanxi from Gansu</p>
<p>The Liangyou Photographic Travel Group, departing from Shanghai, has traveled for three months, covering over 20,000 li. They have collected a large number of photographs. The group has already worked in sections, initially along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway line, then explored various ports in East China by sea, visiting Shanhaiguan in the east and entering Tianjin. From there, they went to key areas in North China. At the beginning of November, they left Pingxi and traveled west, spending over forty days on the northwest journey. They photographed the Hetao area in great detail. Recently, they completed their work in Lanzhou and are heading to Xi'an via Pingliang. The Yellow River basin has been completed in stages. Except for slightly exceeding the budget, they have been fortunate to avoid unexpected difficulties and obstacles. The inconvenience of transportation and the hardships of traveling in the cold are all expected. Wherever the group goes, people in various places deeply appreciate this cultural initiative and are happy to support it.</p>
<h3>Citizens of Nanjing Road Firmly Oppose Telephone Rate Hike</h3>
<p>Refuting the Municipal Council's Reply</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association previously sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Ratepayers' Association, and others, requesting that they work together to oppose the telephone rate hike. Recently, they received a reply from the Municipal Council forwarded by these two associations.

<h3>Consultant for Readers</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Zhixin inquires: The difficulty of finding employment and the mismatch between education and employment are well-known facts in China today. Your publication has also discussed this issue several times, and I do not wish to express my opinions. Especially since I can be considered someone who has a job, even if it is somewhat "mismatched" and unsatisfactory. However, reading the news about people marching for hunger and demanding bread allows me to be content. But I want to raise a further question: how to maintain my job! To put it bluntly, how to "keep my rice bowl"? Because based on my feelings and observed facts, keeping one's rice bowl does not depend on ability but on connections and dog-like behavior. To put it nicely, it is called loyalty; more generally, it is called catering to and currying favor; to be blunt, it is called flattery! However, for me, these are precisely the most difficult conditions! I have no relatives, not even distant ones, to rely on, not even from the same hometown! My temperament is also somewhat eccentric, and I am not inclined to speak much, let alone engage in empty praise. The hypocritical and slavish nature of constantly saying "yes" is naturally something I cannot learn or imitate. But I don't want to lose my rice bowl. What should I do? To make a joke: should I introduce my younger female cousin to the manager? Or should I ask my wife to become a goddaughter? Otherwise, must I transform myself, put on a smiling face, and force myself to socialize? Here, I earnestly request your detailed guidance.</p>
<p>Reply: What you said in your letter is indeed true, and I believe it is not only you who feels this way. However, this is ultimately an abnormal state, not a normal one! In more modern and enlightened institutions, this problem has already been eliminated, and it is no longer as you describe in your letter. And the most important prerequisite should still be economic. Because the entire mode of production is still in a feudal stage, it is not surprising that there are such feudal blood ties and servility. Furthermore, there is the fear of unemployment. Because if not for that, things would not be this way. It is precisely because there are many job seekers that people prioritize relatives over outsiders, as the saying goes, "Arms do not bend outwards." Your publication previously published an article forcefully defending the company, which was subsequently refuted by our association. Now, the reasons cited by the Municipal Council still favor the company and are biased. It is truly outrageous. Although the telephone company has incurred huge expenses due to replacing old equipment with new ones, according to their own statement, from the company's establishment on August 5, 1930, to the end of September this year, a period of 26 months, the total loss amounted to 218,430 taels. Even considering the losses over 26 months, although the Shanghai Telephone Company has strived to expand its lines more than fourfold and has hired mostly Western staff, paying them generous salaries, it is a natural consequence of extravagance and miscalculation that they have incurred losses. This cannot serve as sufficient justification for a large price increase or for retroactively compensating for new prices. As it stands now, if you want to resolve the situation, quell the unrest, you must have accounting experts delegated by impartial social organizations audit the company's books to determine whether a price increase is justified and whether the amount of the increase is reasonable, in order to achieve a fair resolution. It is hoped that you will not be intimidated by pressure and willingly give up, sacrificing the interests of the majority. That would be fortunate. (To the Ratepayers' Association) In response to your letter of December 1 (the same as the letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, omitted), and noting that the association's letter to the Municipal Council on November 15 has not yet been replied to, we do not know why. We are also enclosing a draft of the letter to the Municipal Council for your reference (the letter to the Municipal Council has already been published in the newspaper on November 17 and is also omitted).</p>
<h3>First Day of Chen Tianxiao's Patriotic Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Chen Tianxiao's personal painting exhibition to save the nation opened at the Ningbo Hometown Association yesterday. On the first day, over 1,000 people attended, including Ye Gongchuo, Wang Yiting, Xu Shiying, Pan Tianhui, Xu Yuanqing, Weng Ziguang, Lv Hongxun, Xu Shoumei, Gao Shi, Ruan Qiubai, Guo Jiuru, and others. Nearly half of them brought scrolls for the drawing. Many attendees praised the exhibition, and some even wrote inscriptions on the spot to commend Mr. Chen. The printed postcards of his paintings, sold for one dime each, were purchased in large quantities. During this time of national crisis, Chen is a leader in individual art exhibitions to save the nation.</p>
<p>This is, of course, the natural tendency of human society, so your joke is very sad. If there is any such event based on the occupation it will be such a shame. The person-to-person bond is not supposed to be like an uninspired article. It is not a must to flatter the manager. It is not advisable to live by the book, you should just do what you have to do.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Mingcheng asks: I am now in the final semester of junior high school... I feel the most distressed about writing compositions. Whenever the teacher writes a topic on the blackboard, I feel that I have many ideas to write about, but when I pick up the pen, I can't write anything... The teacher often writes "dry" or even "incoherent" on my papers. Sir, how can I avoid being dry, and how can I be coherent? The teacher has taught us to read more books. He has given us a very long reading list. When I saw that reading list, I initially felt flustered and didn't know which book to read. Later, although I bought a few books, I couldn't find any interest in them... Moreover, this method seems to take too long. Sir, do you have a better method?</p>
<p>Note: Even according to the reading list the teacher gave me, I personally don't have enough money to buy them all.</p>
<p>Reply: An article is generally inseparable from two parts: form and content. The so-called content is the essence of an article, the material it contains. Form is the tool for expressing this content. Having a tool of expression without anything to express is just an empty shell; this is "dryness." Having material but not knowing how to express it is "涩"; or if it is expressed but does not match the original intention, or if the tool of expression is used incorrectly, it is "incoherent." For example, a table: whether the tabletop is square or round, three-legged or four-legged, is the form. Whether it is made of pine, chestnut, or steel is the content. Drawing a table on paper, even if the form is complete, is empty and has no practical value; this is dryness. Just a pile of wood or steel is also not</p>
<h3>Chinese Typewriter Company Donates Funds to Northeast Refugees</h3>
<p>The China Industrial Company at No. 9 Hankou Road in Shanghai, recognizing that it is now the freezing winter in the borderlands, and the refugees in the three northeastern provinces are either wandering homeless, crying out to the heavens and earth, or sleeping in the open, suffering from hunger and cold, and the people in the rear cannot bear to sit idly by, are taking advantage of this Northeast Refugee Relief Entertainment Fair to donate to the refugees from the sale of the new Chinese typewriter, a completely domestic product patented by the National Government and produced by the company. The typewriter originally sold for 300 yuan, but now the company is selling it to customers at a 10% discount and will donate an additional 30 yuan to the Northeast refugees for each typewriter sold. This kind of righteous act is the first of its kind in the current industrial and commercial circles, and we hope that all circles will enthusiastically follow suit. It is said that a sample of the typewriter can be obtained for free from Mr. Yu Binqi of the Sports Group at the New World Entertainment Fair.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County to Move its Governance, Effective January 1st</h3>
<p>County Party Headquarters and Education Bureau to Move First</p>
<p>County Government and Finance Bureau to Follow</p>
<p>The issue of Shanghai County moving its seat of governance was submitted to the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Office for approval. The county government and construction bureau then created drawings and solicited bids for construction. Six months have passed since construction began, and the project has now been completed. The county government has scheduled to begin the move on January 1st. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>New Site Completed</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Government, all areas under its jurisdiction have been incorporated into the urban area. This means that although the county government is located in the urban area, its administrative functions are primarily carried out in the surrounding rural towns. Therefore, the proposal to move the seat of governance was put forward. The county government then prepared a relocation plan, including drawings and budget, and submitted it to the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Office for approval. In June of this year, bids were solicited for construction at a cost of over 75,000 yuan. Since construction began, the project has progressed rapidly and is now fully completed.</p>
<h3>Water and Electricity Supply</h3>
<p>The new county seat is located in Beiqiao, which is traversed by the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road. The area's commerce is quiet, and it is entirely a village. The county government's relocation here can realize Premier Sun Yat-sen's idea of "going to the people." The roads surrounding the new county government have also been fully paved. The electricity is supplied by a small generator installed by the Minhang Commercial Electric Light Company, providing electricity for the entire county government. In terms of drinking water, there is no tap water available in the area, making it inconvenient to install. Drilling artesian wells may also be too late, so the water from the Zhuye River in front of the new county government is currently used for drinking. The river flows east-west in front of the county government, connecting to the Beimiao Canal, and indirectly to the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Convenient Transportation</h3>
<p>The sides of the roads surrounding the county government are planted with trees for decoration, which has now been completed. As a result, the scenery is quite beautiful, and the air is particularly fresh. From Shanghai, long-distance buses on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road can reach the area. You can get off at Beiqiao Station, making transportation quite convenient.</p>
<h3>Relocation Procedures</h3>
<p>According to Ye Dezhen, secretary of the county government, speaking to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the new county government buildings have all been completed, and the decoration and painting are also nearing completion. Electric wires are now being installed, and electric lights are being installed. It is scheduled to relocate the county party headquarters and the Construction Bureau starting on New Year's Day next year, followed by the Education Bureau and the directly affiliated Public Security Branch of the county government. As for desks: this is astringent. If wood is made into tables, but not polished or painted, or it is neither square nor round, and if the four legs are fitted with three, it is also not practical; this is incomprehensible. We should choose good materials and make a decent and practical table; this is the true meaning of writing. The antidote for your "dry" or "incomprehensible" writing is "reading more," and there is no other "better way." The meaning of the three words "read more" is very important. First, you must know that what you are reading is indeed a "book," that is, a valuable book. The ones assigned by your teacher now are naturally valuable and worth reading. Second, you must truly "read" and not just flip through the book. Read it word by word, sentence by sentence, and look up or ask about anything you don't understand. When reading, you should always pay attention to the same meaning, and think about how you would write it yourself, and whether the author's expression is the best. When you encounter valuable ideas, your own insights, or beautiful phrases, you should immediately copy or mark them. Third, it must be "more" in substance, not just in number. Do it diligently, and there is no need to be "flustered." There is no such thing as a one-step path to success. "Getting rich quick" is the thought of a hopeless person. Everything that comes from hard work and perseverance is your own. I sympathize with your eagerness to improve, but if you find the method "too slow," you will inevitably fall into the trap of "more haste, less speed." As for the problem of buying books, you might consider organizing a book club, where everyone either contributes money to buy them together and takes turns reading them, and then gives them to the school library as a souvenir or draws lots to distribute them upon graduation; or each person buys several books and borrows them from each other, so that everyone can work together to solve the problem easily.</p>
<p>As for the county government and the Finance Bureau, because there are many files, they still need to be sorted and packed, so they will be relocated after the county party headquarters and the Education Bureau. By the end of January, all the relocation should be completed.</p>
<h3>Building New Dormitories</h3>
<p>For the convenience of office work during this relocation, a dormitory is specially built for the staff to live in. This dormitory is being built with separate funding and only started construction last month. It is expected to be completed in February.</p>
<h3>Use of the Old Site</h3>
<p>The existing county government site has been given to the municipal government. It is said that the municipal government plans to use it for the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Someone from the bureau came to inspect it a few days ago, but when the Public Security Bureau moves in the future, it will still need major repairs.</p>
<h3>Power Outage in Nanshi Lasts Half an Hour</h3>
<p>At 6:45 last night, the electricity suddenly went out in the area from Laoximen within the city of Nanshi to Xiaodongmen up to Laobeimen. Almost the entire Nanshi fell into darkness. Only the section west of Laobeimen maintained its original brightness. The power was restored after about half an hour. However, one thing was enough to make people wonder: when the lights went out, the entire Nanshi suddenly heard a very loud buzzing roar, similar to the venting sound when a train starts. At the time, some people suspected that this sound was related to the power outage, but even after the power was restored, the sound continued uninterrupted for a long time before subsiding. As for the reason for the sudden power outage, it is said that it was caused by the explosion of the generator's square shed.</p>
<h3>Shooting of Soldier During "Lone Army" Filming in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Circumstances of the Accident Are Under Investigation</p>
<p>Actress Yang Liuqing Seriously Injured</p>
<p>"Lone Army," the debut film of the Shanghai Great China Film Company, is a war film. The first group of the film crew set off for Suzhou on the 5th, and the second group set off on the 15th. On the 16th, they officially started filming some of the war scenes. At about 7 a.m., Director Chen Fu led the entire cast and crew, along with a team of soldiers from the 87th Division stationed in Suzhou, to the filming location to prepare for filming a charge scene. Among the soldiers, someone mistakenly took a rifle loaded with live ammunition. Suddenly, bullets flew everywhere. One bullet hit Yang Liuqing, one of the actresses in the film, and killed a soldier named Wang Debiao. At the time, the wounded and the dead were immediately taken to the hospital, and a special telegram was sent to the Shanghai head office to discuss the aftermath. Yesterday morning, Zhang Peilan, the manager of the company, and Zhou Shidong, the production manager, took the early train to Suzhou to investigate the circumstances of the accident.</p>

<p>The Police Are Still Investigating Other Cases</p>

<p>One handgun, six bullets, and three fake handguns were seized and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division One, where Judge Qian Hongye conducted a preliminary hearing. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the defendants were carrying weapons and were specializing in robbing pedestrians of their property on various roads in the concession (commonly known as "peeling pigs"). The number of cases they have committed is countless. Yesterday, the defendants confessed to six robbery cases at the police station. However, according to the police investigation, they have actually committed more than ten robbery cases. Due to the limited time, it has not been possible to investigate in detail. It is requested that the defendants be detained pending further investigation and formal prosecution. After verifying the confession, Judge Qian briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to be detained for further investigation and interrogation.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of the Shen Bao: The letter from Huang Zhanying to Jin Xi, published in your newspaper, lists me as a witness. All the things mentioned, especially those related to Zhao Qingqing, are very different from the facts. Because the wording is long and I am afraid of being lengthy, I cannot send the corrected text. In short, this case cannot be brought to light or used to confuse the public unless it is publicly reviewed by legal organizations, patriotic groups, or legitimate bodies such as the Municipal Party Department and Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, and the documents and witnesses in the case are examined, nor can it be because Jin Xi's father and son are not in Shanghai and cannot come to Shanghai.

<h3>Jin Learning Tide Blood</h3>
<p>One Teacher and Student Mutually Mutilate</p>
<p>Student Military Police Clash Again</p>
<p>(Taiyuan Communication) The student tide in Taiyuan First Normal School caused a sensation. After the incident on the 22nd of last month, the perpetrators Du Lianxiu and Zhang Yaohua and other five students left the school without permission and did not return all night. After the school authorities found out, they decided to expel the five students. On the 24th, Yang Yuanrui and Li Changgeng led a total of 70 to 80 first-year students from the school to petition the Department of Education. They were not able to get their way, so they all returned to the school and stayed in the hall of the department for seven days. They were escorted back to the school by military police and gendarmes. It happened that the principal of the school, Huang, was detained by the procuratorate of the local court. No one in charge of the school, the petitioning students, returned in frustration and moved to the Wanzixiang Hotel. At 4:00 p.m. on the 7th of this month, led by Ma Ruilong and Li Danting, they attacked the school with bricks. At that time, roars echoed, and the arrogance was soaring. Tiles and gravel were thrown into the school, and many doors and windows were smashed. Five or six students in the school were hit in the head. The petitioning students, a total of six or seventy people, returned to their residences in frustration. At about 4:00 in the morning on the 20th, more than 300 students in the school were still dreaming sweetly. The petitioning students, a total of 40 or 50 people, led by Du Lianxiu, Zhang Yaohua, Yang Yuanrui, and Li Changgeng, returned to the school in a mixed formation. These students broke into the school, armed with knives and sticks, over the wall. The dormitories, faculty and staff dormitories, principal's office, grudges of students, self-study rooms, glass doors and windows, sundries, utensils, books, bedding, etc. of the school and affiliated primary school and vocational teachers were all smashed. The students in the school did not dare to stay. Wang Junying and others more than ten people were broken heads, broken legs, residual arms, blood spraying like springs, the situation is extremely pitiful. These students are now living in Shanxi Hospital for recuperation. According to the doctors, Wang and other three students suffered fatal injuries and are terrified of escaping. Liu Jun, the head of the affiliated primary school, and Liu Ying, a teacher training student, and other seven or eight people were tied up with hemp ropes and beaten with sticks by the petitioning students. Liu and others were seriously injured. When the reporter wrote this article, Liu and others had been bound for 16 hours. Liu and others were locked in a dark room of the school by the petitioning students, and the surveillance was very strict. It has not yet been heard that they will be released. The government, in the face of this tragedy, has once again staged a real tragedy, and is in pain and regret. It has decided to take effective measures in accordance with the previous order to solve the four principles of the school's storm. The order in the school is now maintained by military police and gendarmes sent by the authorities. The translation of the sports meeting, the petition letter of the tragedy, the division of the region, and the efforts to carry out affairs to determine the final male and female clouds, (12·13·Jiao Zhang in Taiyuan Hotel)</p>
<p>Taiyuan, 17th. More than a thousand students from Jin Yishi, Chengzongyang Xing Nvshi Teacher's College Affiliated Middle School and other schools went to the provincial government to petition on the 17th. First, Councilor Gao Shiyue met with the representatives. The students believed that the answer was unsatisfactory. They followed each other, but were blocked by the guards, resulting in a conflict. Fourteen students were injured and sent to Chuanzhi Students' Hospital. Soldiers were also injured. There is still no accurate investigation. Officials then transferred military officers to relieve the pressure on the students before they dispersed and returned to school. In the evening, representatives from each school held a meeting at the First Normal School to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<h3>Speaking Out for Middle Schools Nationwide (3)</h3>
<p>— Liao Maoru</p>
<p>We do not support the cancellation of the division between arts and sciences, not because we undervalue mathematics and science. The key to building a solid foundation in mathematics and science is to provide rigorous training to junior high school students. If the mathematics and science courses in junior high school are taught well, students with a slight aptitude for mathematics and science will naturally pursue that path. Even for students with less talent, if you lighten the teaching materials and teach them slowly, they can still keep up. This is the way to cater to individual needs and abilities. How can it be done otherwise?</p>
<p>Let's not talk about our own country for now; let's see what the situation is like in foreign countries. The division of subjects in middle school can be said to be a common phenomenon in various countries. However, in the United States, many courses are divided within the same school. In European countries, many courses are divided within schools of the same level to meet individual needs. Although the methods differ, the principles are the same. For example, Germany has humanities middle schools, practical science middle schools, and science middle schools, similar to the four types of middle schools recently proposed. The curricula are also different, with some focusing on ancient culture, some on the comparative culture of various European countries, some on mathematics and science, and some on the entirety of German culture. Since middle school subjects are too numerous and varied, it is impossible to cover everything in detail. Dividing them into several courses can allow each school to have a central purpose. France, known for its conservatism, has fierce debates about middle school curricula. However, the 1902 education system divided the early middle school into two types of courses, A and B. Type A focused on classical literature, and Type B focused on modern literature and science. The later stage was divided into four types of courses, making the distinction between arts and sciences even clearer. In 1923, although the government had a tendency to return to the classics, ordering all middle schools to study the same courses for the first four years, the second phase was divided into three branches, with arts and sciences still clearly separated. This return to tradition was opposed by various parties, and in 1925, the government revised it, dividing the first four and last two years of middle school into two groups, A and B, balancing the benefits of liberal arts education and practical education, and reconciling student interests with the postponement of specialization. The British education system is the most complex, but the British advocate freedom, so there are many different types of schools to meet the special needs of young people. The most fixed and uniform system is that of Japan. Some say that the curriculum promulgated by the government this time is largely influenced by Japanese middle schools. However, Japanese middle schools are nominally five years, but in reality, only four. Many middle school students who have completed four years of study apply to higher schools, so the current middle school has become a disguised junior high school, while higher schools are equivalent to high schools. Although middle schools do not divide subjects, higher schools do, and the Japanese education system, with primary schools and middle schools running parallel, also uses many different types of schools to meet the needs of different students. This is similar to the European education system. After our country canceled the division of subjects in ordinary middle schools, there are no other schools to remedy the situation, which is very different from Japan.</p>
<p>Another point we must know is that Japan is very serious about education and is not willing to change it easily. Their middle school curriculum has been preserved to this day after many years of experimentation and improvement. They have not rashly adopted any one system. I remember that when the author visited Japan for the second time, the Ministry of Education was studying the teaching methods of English classes in middle schools. They started with phonetics, invited experts to guide them, and designated one or two middle schools to be responsible for testing. After the test had achieved results, they would then order all middle schools in the country to follow suit. Their government requires so much effort for even a partial issue of middle school teaching methods. As for the entire curriculum, how could they suddenly order all schools in the country to change it without a long period of research and testing? Once, Wen Kang asked Zhong Hui, "What did you hear to come, and what did you see to leave?" We should also ask the Ministry of Education why the provisional standards of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China were suddenly promulgated and suddenly canceled. What were the results of the experiment? What were the advantages and disadvantages? Will the new curriculum be overturned again after being implemented for a year or six months? Education is a major national matter, and such easy changes are disappointing.</p>
<h3>3. Canceling the Credit System and Elective System is Too Rigid</h3>
<p>When the credit system and elective system were first implemented, there may have been drawbacks, such as: (1) Courses were scattered and unsystematic; (2) Students had no standards for choosing courses; (3) Major subjects might be lowered. However, after more than ten years of improvement, these problems have been largely resolved. Now, suddenly restoring the old system and wiping out more than ten years of hard work does not seem like the administrative authorities are encouraging schools to move forward. We often hear people say that China's education has gone bankrupt, and that the level of Chinese students is declining year by year. Whether education has gone bankrupt and whether the level of students is declining year by year has no objective evidence. Even if it is true, we should investigate the real reasons and try to remedy them, not just echo the sentiments and blame everything on the credit system and elective system. After the September 18th Incident last year, few students across the country could concentrate on their studies, which led to difficulties in applying to universities this summer. Can we blame the elective system and credit system for this? National politics are turbulent, the economy is declining, and administrative authorities and social elites cannot set an example for young people, which leads to successive student movements and a decline in academic atmosphere. Can we blame the elective system and credit system for this? The United States and various European countries all have elective systems. Why don't we hear them protesting? "Our country has a vast territory, and the conditions in various places are different" (see the Ministry of Education's circular). Don't say that the fixed curriculum now promulgated by the Ministry of Education cannot suit the conditions of various places and the needs of various schools; even after decades or centuries, enlightened educational administrative authorities should not hold this idea. The Ministry of Education can only stipulate the general outline and must leave room for flexibility. We must know that there are many courses that can be offered in middle schools, and the Ministry of Education can never list all the important subjects in the curriculum. The subjects listed in the curriculum are not necessarily the most important, and the allocation of time may not be appropriate. To give an example, the curriculum promulgated this time lists drawing as a compulsory subject in high school and has two hours per week. If high school students study drawing for two hours every week, and everyone becomes an artist, that would be great. However, artistic talent cannot be forced. Rather than teaching most young people to scribble meaninglessly, why not offer several elective courses and let them choose to study according to their interests? Therefore, canceling the credit system and elective system only has disadvantages, and we cannot see any benefits.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Faculty and Staff Temporary Congress of Full Representatives</p>
<h3>Petitioning the Education Fee Management Office to Issue Salaries</h3>
<p>Director Niu is Responsible for Issuing Two and a Half Months of Funding</p>
<p>Consulting on Concrete Measures Last Night, Another Meeting Today</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial United Association of Middle School Faculty and Staff held a temporary congress of full representatives at 10:00 AM on the 16th at the Second Academy of Nanjing Middle School. The proceedings of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>Song Zhongjiang Chen Cheng, Su Girls' Normal School Yang Guangjun, Yang Zhong Wu Cangli Wang Xiaoshang Yin Mingfu, Hai Normal School Zhang Jingfeng, Su Agriculture Zhu Yuqing, Shang Zhong Chen Yue Wen Xuancheng, Taicang Normal School Zhang Yuanming Xie Fanghui, Hushuguan Party School Jiang Cuiying Zhou Yisong, Girls' Middle School Zhang Huiheng, Party Normal School Wu Dezhang Wang Weiyi Xia Peiri, Luoshe Township Normal School Gao Hongqi, Jieshou Township Normal School Wang Zhenhua, Nan Zhong Zhou Zhongchen Zhou Yueren, Guanyun Township Normal School Xu Yisheng, Rugao Normal School Feng Mingfu, Su Ding Wu Xuepei, Chang Zhong Wu Xuezeng Wu Zhipu, Tong Zhong Cheng Jifang, Huangdu Township Normal School Geng Qinghua, Xi Normal School Zhang Zhongyou Gao Yizhi, Xu Zhong Xu Yinkun, Nan Girls' Middle School Tian Muzhi, Yan Zhong Qiao Yuhong, Xu Girls' Normal School Mao Shuda, Wujiang Township Normal School Zhu Wenda, Su Zhong Zhang Gongsu Chen Yongfeng, etc., totaling 26 schools and 37 representatives.</p>
<h3>Morning Meeting</h3>
<p>The meeting began at 10:00 AM with due ceremony. First, Wu Dezhang, a Standing Committee member of the Executive Committee, reported on the purpose and process of convening this temporary congress. Then, he introduced the newly joined Rural Normal School members. Wu Dezhang was publicly elected as the chairman of today's meeting, and Chen Yue was the secretary. Liu Beihe, Section Chief of the Education Fee Management Office, attended the meeting upon invitation and reported that Section Chief Yang Zishen of the office was currently urging various counties to pay up and would return to Nanjing tomorrow, at which point the amount of education fees collected this time would be known. The Management Office has already completely issued notifications for the first half of August's funding for provincial schools. Part of the funds was temporarily advanced after negotiating with the bank. The notification for the second half of August's funding was already filled out, but has not been issued because the funds are still insufficient. After Liu's report, the faculty and staff representatives earnestly expressed the difficult situation of the accumulated arrears of funding for provincial schools, hoping that the Management Office would be truly responsible for issuing the accumulated arrears. It happened that Director Niu had a phone call and summoned Section Chief Liu back to the office, so he entrusted Liu to arrange for all representatives to go to the Management Office at 3:00 PM today to meet with Director Niu in person. Then, the minimum standard for requesting funding was discussed. It was decided that the minimum standard was to issue the funding for August, September, and October (a total of two and a half months, including the half month already issued in August) and to have a concrete guarantee. (Rural Normal Schools that have already issued more funding than other middle schools in advance will still be handled according to the old plan.) The representatives unanimously agreed that the so-called issuing three months (that is, two and a half months) refers to the present situation, and they still hope to issue the funding for November before the winter vacation. Then, the proposal to express opinions on the unsuitable and unrealistic situation of the Measures for Service and Treatment of Faculty and Staff of Secondary Schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education was discussed. The five resolutions passed by the Executive Committee in the last two meetings were submitted for discussion. Only the third item on salary was slightly changed, and the rest were passed as is. (1) Implement a full-time teacher system, and do not calculate salaries by the hour. (2) Teaching hours: 14 to 18 hours per week for high school, 16 to 20 hours per week for junior high school. (3) Salaries: 140 to 200 yuan per month for high school, 100 to 150 yuan per month for junior high school. (4) The actual budget should be calculated using the median of the teaching hours and the median of the salaries. (5) Those who hold grade or department positions should reduce teaching time by six hours. Then, Zhang Gongsu of Su Zhong, Zhou Yueren of Nan Zhong, Xia Peibai of Zhen Normal School, Wu Cangli of Yang Zhong, Wen Xuancheng of Shang Zhong, Zhu Wenda of Wujiang Township Normal School, and Zhang Zhongyou of Xi Normal School were publicly elected as representatives of the seven schools to go to the Ministry of Education tomorrow to petition and state the above opinions. At 1:00 PM, lunch was served, and in the afternoon, all representatives took a photo.</p>
<h3>Afternoon Petition</h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, more than 30 representatives went to the Education Fee Management Office. It happened that Director Niu had important official business at the Ministry of Civil Service Affairs and did not arrive until 4:00 PM. Wu Dezhang, Zhang Zhongyou, Zhang Gongsu, Xia Peibai, Wang Xiaoshang, and Chen Yue, the representatives of the faculty and staff, successively expressed their opinions based on the resolutions. Section Chief Liu Beihe reported that he had recently telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, stating that the provincial schools' funding was in arrears for four months, and that the schools were eagerly awaiting funding for the upcoming year-end holidays. He requested that the 365,000 yuan owed to the province for the nineteenth and twentieth years of the Republic of China be repaid. (The provincial funds were to be subsidized 300,000 yuan each year. 65,000 yuan was owed in the nineteenth year, and nothing was paid in the twentieth year, totaling the above amount. This 300,000 yuan subsidy had been approved by the provincial government and included in the official budget. In the twenty-first year, the Department of Finance was unwilling to subsidize, and the Department of Education strongly argued for it, resulting in a compromise. Therefore, whether or not the subsidy will be paid in the twenty-first year is still uncertain. However, the old debts of the nineteenth and twentieth years should be paid.) It was requested that half of the amount be allocated in the middle of this month to meet urgent needs, and the Department of Education was also telegraphed to negotiate with the Department of Finance to raise funds as much as possible. Currently, the Department of Education has only telegraphed back saying that the Department of Finance has agreed to allocate a portion (it is not known how much). As for the Management Office directly ordering various county bureaus, they were limited to clearing the October education fees by the 15th of this month and clearing the November funding by the 25th, and Yang Zishen was sent to various counties to urge them, etc. Director Niu Tisheng said that it was too much to say that the faculty and staff had only received the salary for the first half of August, half a month since the provincial schools started. He had already thought of many ways. 1. Ask the Department of Finance to raise half of the outstanding subsidies first. 2. Organize and urge the payment of arrears from various counties. 3. Consider borrowing money. At this time of harvest, it is the peak season, and it is estimated that, with the combined efforts of all parties, in addition to the notification for the second half of August, which has already been filled out and is awaiting funding, the September notification can be signed and issued by the Audit Committee on the 25th of this month, and the October notification can be signed and issued by the Audit Committee on January 10th. The Management Office can be responsible for issuing these two and a half months (that is, August, September, and October) of funding. As for the hope of the provincial school colleagues to issue the November funding, the Management Office will do its best. By January 30th, perhaps one month or half a month of November can still be issued. In general, they will try their best to meet everyone's hopes. The representatives were very satisfied with Director Niu's sincere attitude and with the efforts of Section Chief Yang to urge payment. Director Niu arranged for the representatives to meet again at the Management Office at 7:00 PM on the 17th to discuss concrete measures and to learn about the latest education fees received by Section Chief Yang. The meeting then adjourned, and the representatives went to the banquet hosted by Principal Zhang of Nan Zhong. The representatives decided to meet again at 10:00 AM on the 17th to prepare the seven representatives to go to the Ministry of Education to petition.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Cracks Down on Schools Using False Names for Deception</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau previously found an advertisement in the November 10th Xinwen Bao advertising column for the Moonlight English School at 474 Nanjing Road, Shanghai, offering "Sex History" with an image of the author Zhang Jingsheng. The bureau immediately sent personnel to investigate and found that there was no Moonlight English School at that address. There was only a general affairs office located in the Lianyi Trading Company behind Shi Weiji on Nanjing Road, which was the place to sell the books mentioned in the advertisement. The bureau believes that it is using the name of the school to publish advertisements and deceive people. It has already sent a letter to the First Special District Local Court to strictly crack down on it to serve as a warning and avoid being fooled.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau Schedules Examinations for Primary School Teachers</h3>
<p>The registration for the second session of the examination for primary school teachers organized by the Municipal Education Bureau has already begun.

Oral and written examinations will be held at Wuben Girls' Middle School on the 25th. In order to focus on the qualifications of primary school teachers, the bureau, in addition to already reorganizing the teaching staff of municipal schools, will also order private schools from the next semester onwards not to hire unqualified teachers. Teachers whose examination validity has expired or who have not registered due to a lack of registration qualifications should register as soon as possible to wait for the examination.</p>

<h3>Strength Analysis</h3>
<p>England: Composed of strong players from West Point, Lancashire, Agger, etc. Yu Men comes from Agger, and Rowden and Kage belong to Lancashire. Marcel is West Point's new right-back, fast and accurate. The whole team is well-rounded.</p>
<p>Scotland: Bratland, Crawford, Hurley, and Jack are all strong players from West Point. Jackson's performance is promising. Backster is a veteran of the Westerners' team. The six players are all from Agger, so Scotland's strength is slightly better than England's.</p>
<p>Portugal: Many famous veterans with maritime experience, such as Gustai and Colasa. However, although the talent is good, they lack practice, making it difficult to achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Jewish: The Jewish team eliminated Scotland in last year's American competition. In the semi-finals, they drew with England, and only lost in the rematch. Therefore, their strength in this tournament should also be considerable.</p>
<p>Russia: Will be represented by strong players from the Shakur team, but their strength is likely to be average. The gap between them and the Chinese team will certainly be large.</p>
<p>Shanghai Youth Basketball League Group A Situation</p>
<h3>Pirates Temporarily Lead</h3>
<p>Shanghai University Must Work Hard</p>
<p>Little Interest in Last Night's Five Games</p>
<p>Since the start of the Shanghai Youth Basketball League, there hasn't been a single undefeated team in Group A in January. The Pirates, who were rampant for a while, were unexpectedly defeated by Mai Ling. Shanghai University has a well-organized lineup and a high voice for winning the championship, but unexpectedly they were defeated by Nanxing. Lai Ling, although defeating the Pirates, was defeated by Chi Zhi. The remaining teams have all lost more than twice. Hope is slightly weaker. In the current situation, the Pirates, Mai Ling, and Shanghai University are equally matched. However, because the Pirates have played one more game, they temporarily lead. Shanghai University has strong strength, and if they can do well, it will not be difficult to compete with the Pirates and Mai Ling. The scores of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name Games Played Wins Losses Percentage</p>
<p>Pirates Seven Six One 857</p>
<p>Mai Ling Six Five One 833</p>
<p>Shanghai University Five Four One 800</p>
<p>John Seven Five Two 714</p>
<p>Chi Zhi Seven Five Two 714</p>
<p>Xia Guang Six Four Two 667</p>
<p>Qing Guang Six Four Two 667</p>
<p>Jinan Six Three Three 500</p>
<p>Nanxing Six Two Four 333</p>
<p>Daredevil Six Two Four 333</p>
<p>Also Seven One Six 143</p>
<p>Jiangwan Six 0 Six 000</p>
<p>Navy Seven 0 Seven 000</p>
<h3>Results of Yesterday's Games</h3>
<p>There were five games last night. The three Group A games were supposed to be the most eye-catching, but the situation in each game was one-sided, with little excitement and declining interest. Only Shanghai University's performance was the most wonderful, refreshing the audience. It's a pity that Jiangwan is getting worse and worse, with uneven talent and no progress in skills, unable to compete with Shanghai University on equal footing.</p>

<h3>Jinan Again Defeats Donghua</h3>
<p>Donghua's Feng Yunyou and Li Ning Injured</p>
<p>Jinan's Walk-off Resumption Sparks Penalty Kick Controversy</p>
<p>Donghua and Jinan met at the baseball field yesterday for the Western League Group A match. Jinan came back from behind to win 3-2. In the middle, Jinan left the field for several minutes due to a penalty kick. They were eventually persuaded to return to the field and resume the game, which was a stroke of great fortune. The referee was Bratland.</p>

<h3>Referee's Interference Causes Dispute</h3>
<p>Donghua and Jinan have equal talent, and the reunion of strong teams is sure to be exciting. At the beginning of the game, they met with courtesy, and the audience was pleasantly surprised, thinking that everything would be fine. However, after thirty minutes, Jiang Shan and Jing Li Yichen clashed in the penalty area. The referee interfered and bounced the ball on the ground again at the penalty spot. The figures were chaotic, and Chen Zhenhe pointed and crashed into the penalty kick. The entire Jinan team left the field and was persuaded to return, but had already lost two goals. After that, their actions were dominated by anger and they were unable to control themselves, which was regrettable.</p>
<h3>Why Be Crude When the Performance is Exquisite?</h3>
<p>Donghua's opening was smooth and continuous, with a very good appearance. The first thirty minutes of the first half were even more dazzling. Later, due to pressure from the opposing rules, they retreated to avoid injury, so there was little performance. In the second half, Donghua's fortunes turned. Feng Yunyou became dizzy and left the field, and Li Ning fought back with an injury, amidst all kinds of difficulties, not knowing where to go. At that time, Jinan had the entire field, and both offense and defense were fierce. If they could have acted civilly, it would have been a truly satisfying performance. Why was it that they could not restrain their wild nature and committed many fouls? Although they won the final victory, it was still felt to be imperfect.</p>
<h3>A Huge Gust of Wind Sweeps into the Goal</h3>
<p>Donghua gained momentum with the help of the wind and took the lead in the attack, taking advantage of the free kick to pounce into the formation. Jiang Shanjing's save became a corner kick. Cao Qiuting kicked it well, and Chen Hongguang volleyed it towards the goal. Xie Quanhe had anticipated this and calmly escaped the danger. Jinan's Chen Zhenhe came head-on, and the Donghua line shook. Zhou Xianyan personally came out to calm the storm. Jinan was pressured again, and Wan Xianghua's attack failed, turning into a corner kick. The kick was made into the field, and Chen Hongguang once again entered Wan's, shooting towards the goal. A huge gust of wind swept into the goal. Such a spectacle stunned the entire audience.</p>
<h3>Penalty Kick Causes Trouble from Then On</h3>
<p>Jinan, facing the sun and wind, was naturally in a defensive position. Captain Chen's spirit moved, and he changed the line to strengthen the internal strength. The brothers exchanged positions. At this time, Wan Xianghua suddenly attacked with lightning speed, missing by an inch. Otherwise, it would have been dangerous. Afterwards, Jinan rushed into the empty city, the ball moved from left to right, and Mei Hongbao raised his foot to take the penalty kick. Zhou Xianyan fell to the ground to stop him, and the ball turned against him. Then, the Jiang Li clash occurred in Jinan's penalty area, followed by a penalty kick. Jinan left and re-entered the field, losing the second goal. The peaceful world caused trouble from then on. Not five minutes later, Mei Hongbao received a ball from Chen and passed it to the left. At that time, Zhou Xianyan and Li Ning gathered together, and the left was empty. The new general Zhang Hongzao met a header and fell into the goal. Before long, the first half ended, with Donghua leading 2-1.</p>
<h3>Two Goals in a Row Lead to Donghua's Failure</h3>
<p>The two teams changed sides to fight again. The situation was different, and the situation changed. Although Jinan was trailing 1-2, they were full of vigor. They began to attack fiercely, sparing no effort. Donghua's forwards retreated to avoid damage. Only Wan Xianghua dared to venture into the unknown. Li Yichen occasionally got the ball and was trapped in the formation, with no way to find. Returning to Donghua, Zhou Xianyan rolled on the ground and threw it out, with continuous surprises and waves. Li Ning was injured and left the field, resting and returning, but his strength was greatly reduced. Soon Feng Yunyou left the field dizzy, and the interior shook. Chen Zhenhe changed to forward and launched a major attack. Zhou Xianyan fell to the ground to save the ball, Zhang Hongzao rushed to kick it into the goal, creating a draw. Not two minutes later, Li Yichen kicked a free kick, 20 yards from the goal, and took the gate directly. Hitting the post and bouncing back, Chen Hongguang continued to shoot, and Xie caught it with both hands. Jinan's entire army came again. Zhou Xianyan was too eager to save, and was too far from the barrier. Mei kicked it, wanting to return but it was too late, and failed 2-3. Afterwards, Donghua was still trying to find a way out in the encirclement, but it was difficult to add to their favor. As a result, in the Western League Group A match, Donghua suffered its first defeat 2-3.</p>
<h3>Unfortunate Events Are Seen Again</h3>
<p>Before the game, Jinan coach Yu Hengzhi, in the spirit of friendship, invited players from both sides to open their hearts and minds. All the previous events were considered dead, and he hoped to rebuild friendship. However, due to the referee's interference, friction arose, and Jinan's departure from the field gave outsiders a bad impression. Furthermore, the actions were often crude and inappropriate. In short, yesterday's unfortunate events were, to some extent, due to the referee's excessive nitpicking, which was not without reason. The result of the game is undoubtedly valid, but whether the future outcome will be affected will depend on the decision of the Westerners Association Executive Committee.</p>
<h3>Racecourse Results of Three Games</h3>
<p>West Point Wins Lax Group A 4-2</p>
<p>Agger Wins Navy Group A 2-1</p>
<p>Westerners Win French Chamber of Commerce Group A 3-1</p>
<h3>A Study of Football Tactics (3)</h3>
<p>Written in Response to the First Defeat of the Ba City Qunli Team</p>
<p>Anyone with a basic understanding of football knows that the success or failure of a team depends on the entire team's ability to cooperate. Individual performances are detrimental and useless. A single stick is easily broken, but a bundle is hard to destroy. This theory is an ancient truth. The rainbow team members are the main characters in combining a team. Only by uniting the majority of individuals can a complete whole be produced. I believe that if the whole is to improve, it is necessary to start with the individual aspects first. Because if the individual measures are proficient, it will be easier to create small parts of contact. From the understanding of the small parts, the entire cooperation function can be further created. Otherwise, if the individual does not have the instinct to control the ball and the wisdom of the competition, even if you have a clear idea of the overall plan and a wonderfully arranged battle, you will be unable to implement it and ultimately fail. Therefore, if Qunli wants to improve the entire team in the future, it must first seek progress from the players' side. It is a pity that personal progress cannot achieve miraculous results overnight. We still have many upcoming championship games in the near future. We must have a step-by-step approach to temporarily cope with the situation, and then gradually seek fundamental treatment and improvement.</p>
<p>Ali Fei used the middle road blocking defense method to control us and build a great achievement. Then, I believe that other teams will follow suit and use the same tactics and formations to deal with Qunli. Therefore, we must prepare early and not repeat the mistakes of the past. The next time this situation occurs, we must use the lure-the-enemy-out-of-position method and the scattered attack method, developing from both wings to break the enemy. If the enemy still wants to monitor me and Ya Dai in the same way, then let them monitor us. The best way is for other teammates to find ways to attack from both sides, completely forgetting about me and Ya Dai. Don't always think about passing the ball to us. This Temporary Starvation method is used to disrupt the enemy and deceive their minds. Once the enemy's defenses are slightly relaxed, they should find an opportunity to unexpectedly pass the ball to us, which will be easier to succeed. If the enemy refuses to disperse or loosen their grip, then me and Ya Dai have no choice but to do our part, and the rest must find ways to win. In this way, we should take full advantage, because the enemy must have more than two people to monitor us, which is useless. If the enemy uses three people to monitor us two, counting the deduction, each team has eleven people, aren't our nine people fighting his eight people? With the strength of nine people, even if the one-on-one strength is average, it is reasonable to defeat the eight people. In addition, the center-back line is the key to the team's advance and retreat, and the attack and defense are crucial. Success or failure depends on it. Therefore, the center-back line must not be too far away from the forwards. When the forwards attack, they must move forward with them, working from the encirclement to intercept and attack again when the enemy's defense clears. At the same time, the defenders must also be cautious to avoid the disadvantage of not being able to respond from the front and the rear. (If everyone has a good memory, they should remember the first time Lehua went south. At that time, weren't we also often blocked by the majority of the central road advance? At that time, weren't Lehua's two wings the same as the current Qunli team, with mediocre talents? But Lehua's ability to fight and win was all due to the power of the center-back line assisting in the attack. The strength of the center-back line is inextricably linked to a team's strength). In addition, our Long Swinging Passing and FirstTimePassing are lacking. (Qunli's close combat and communication are passable, but long-range attacks are easier. A team must have both methods to be foolproof. We often see them use broadswords to charge into battle like South China). Kicking the ball also often makes the mistake of being too high and too far. Too high takes time and is difficult to accept (very few top-notch teams kick the ball more than ten feet high. I have seen it in Czech teams. The speed of the ball back and forth is twice as fast as here). Too far makes the forwards run in vain. OverkickingMeansOverrunningyourOwnForwards Both are inappropriate. Everyone work hard to improve. If we implement the steps mentioned above, although I dare not guarantee that we will always win in the future, I can guarantee that we will have a better and more disciplined performance than before, which will be noticed by the audience.</p>

<h3>Peaceful Gold Market</h3>
<p>(Trading in a weak market)</p>
<p>According to foreign telegraphs this morning, London's gold price slightly decreased. American silver remained unchanged. The exchange rate between Britain and America remained high. There was no significant change in forward silver prices or American cotton. The gold market opened slightly lower at 807.2 taels. Afterwards, foreign exchange rates were announced. The British exchange rate for this month was 1 shilling 8 pence 125, and the American exchange rate was 27.6875 yuan, slightly tighter than the previous day's closing price. Dadecheng's purchase immediately rose from 7 taels to 7.5 taels. Huabi ate up March American gold at 0.0625. Tianfeng Yongwanxing and others came on the market to compete for purchase, reaching 0.088 taels. Later, Hengxing came up to sell and Hengyu also came out, so it retreated to 6.2 taels. Retail investors bought a little at 7.6 taels. When HSBC announced its price at 9:30, the shilling remained unchanged. Due to the exchange rate squeeze, the American gold was lengthened by 25, falling to around 6 taels. However, the banks' appetite was still good. Huabi settled in January American gold at 875. Hengyu Dadecheng came on the market to buy, and there were no wholesale transactions in the market. The price hovered between 7 and 8 taels for a long time. Near 10:30, Hengxing came on the market to continue selling, and Zhaofengchang and others sold as well, dropping to 4.6 taels. However, the banks' appetite remained good, and the gold price was pulled up. Fuxing Yongyi Yilai bought, rising to 5.9 taels. Afterwards, with the ebb and flow of retail investors, it lingered between 5 and 6 taels. Finally, people's confidence revived, because Zhongfu entered January American gold at 27.875 yuan and Citibank ate February at 28 yuan. The buying sentiment in the market was strong again. Yuanmao Yongfu Yu competed to enter, so it was raised to 7.1 taels at the close. The goods were auctioned at 6.7 taels. The market is closed this afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<h3>Decline of 1.3 Taels</h3>
<p>According to the city's highest price of 808.8 taels and the lowest price of 0.046 taels, there was a fluctuation of more than 4 taels, slightly lower than the previous day's closing price by 1.3 taels.</p>
<h3>Opening Price Reduced by 7 Taels</h3>
<p>The raised price was 873 taels with American gold at 0.25 yuan, a reduction of 66-67 taels. Later, it was 65 taels to 68 taels, and finally 66 taels, 7 taels less than the previous day. The December registration was 808 taels. January and February were both 807 taels, and the water supplement was 805 taels.</p>
<h3>Not Much Trading in Each Firm</h3>
<p>According to statistics, the trading on the table varied greatly between supply and demand. Hengchang Yong, Zhaofengchang, Qianchangxiang, Yongfeng, Fuxingyong, Yifengyong, Zhifengyongfu Taiheng, goods, etc. were buyers. Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanheng, Runchangyu, Yuanmao Yong, and Yuhe were all sellers. Hengyu and Fuyu sometimes came out and sometimes entered. Dadecheng entered more and exited less. Daxingyong and Changshengyong exited and then entered. The Dalian gang sold a total of 4-500 bars and only entered about 200. Hengxing, on behalf of the Guangdong gang, sold more than 1,000 bars. The amount of two-month bars in each firm totaled more than 18,000 on the first day on the market before yesterday, it was said.</p>
<h3>Cooked Red Added 8.5 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cooked red price was still increased by 8.5 taels. There was not much trading. It is estimated that Yang Qinghe, Fuji, and Qiu Tianbao sold a total of about 300 taels to Yingfeng Hengtongfeng Yong, etc.</p>
<h3>More Than 4,000 Not Yet Settled</h3>
<p>All December to January bid gold swaps, the short side Hengxing swapped to Yingfeng Heng, and the long side paid 5 qian due to the small cooked red price (if the cooked red price is increased by 10 taels, the swap can be settled). January to February were generally settled, and among them, 7 bars were traded at a price of 2 qian paid by the long side. In general, the bulls were only willing to settle at the same price, while the shorts wanted to increase their current stock, so there were still more than 4,000 that had not been settled.</p>
<h3>The Process During the Week Was Very Good</h3>
<p>It is found that the market situation this week has rebounded and soared, but the changes have been very dramatic. In January, the smallest price at the beginning of the week was 796.6 taels. On Friday (the 16th), the swap happened to be held, but the prices for the two months were the same. The largest price ever reached an unprecedented high of 819.8 taels. The total review of 23.2 taels in January showed that the 1-2 month swap price was leveled, an increase of 7.4 taels compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market British Tight and American Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver market was still characterized by British shrinkage (which has been falling for a week) and American stability. Private telegraphs were not updated, and forward prices rose slightly by 1 hao. The exchange rate also rose for 6-7 days, rising by 2.375 to 8125 yesterday. As for the Shanghai market, the exchange rate was slightly different. The HSBC-listed American gold was lengthened by 25, and other currencies such as French and German also followed. British, Indian, Hong Kong, and Singapore currencies remained unchanged. This was probably because the domestic market was also related to the exchange rate, so the British market was tight and the American market was loose. It is estimated that British gold initially rose steadily and then leveled off, and finally shrank by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. American gold was stable in the morning, then loosened, and recovered to stability at noon. The overall increase was slightly 0.0625. The trading volume of each bank was not quiet. It is estimated that there were more than 100,000 pounds of British gold, and each firm mostly sold it off. Bombay electricity entered January, and American gold was sold by the gold industry again for 4-500,000 yuan. Banks such as Huabi and old Citibank continued to absorb it. American Bank bought March, and the market was closed on Saturday.</p>
<p>(British Exchange) The domestic market had a fluctuation of 0.0625 in the first half of the day. The opening selling price in the morning was 1 shilling 8 pence 125 for December and January, 1875 for February, and 25 for March. The buying price was increased by 0.0625. Huabi ate February at 25, Pangen ate March at 3125, Zhenggin McGalli made three months at 3125 with each other, McGalli sold January at 1875, Mitsui ate March at 3125, Shanghai ate January at 25, Zhongfu McGalli did the same for January at 25, Anda Mitsui made February and March at 3125, and Citibank ate January at 25. The closing selling price at noon was 8 pence 1875 to 3125, and the buying price was 25 to 375.</p>
<p>(American Exchange) The domestic market fluctuated by 125 in the first half of the day, with the opening selling price in the morning at 27.75 yuan for December, 8125 for January, 375 for February, and 8 yuan for March. The buying price was 875 to 8.125 yuan. Bibi ate three months at 8.0625 yuan. Zhongfu McGalli and American Bank also ate three months at 8.0625 yuan. Zhongfu ate January at 7.875 yuan, Citibank ate February at 8 yuan, three months at 0625, China sold to Huabi four yuan one eight seven five, Huabi sold to China December seven yuan eight seven five, later the selling price was twenty-seven yuan eight one two five to eight yuan zero six two five, the buying price was nine three seven five to one eight seven five. American Bank one yuan, Heyin three liang six qian three fen six li three hao six.</p>
<h3>Big Bar Flat and Far Long</h3>
<p>The National News Agency's 17th London telegram stated that the recent price of large bars remained unchanged at 17 pence, and the forward price returned to long by 0.0625, changing to 17 pence 0625. The British-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan 3 jiao 1 fen.</p>

<h3>The Weekend Financial Market Remains Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and the atmosphere in the money and banking sector was typically quiet. Although foreign exchange was not deserted, transactions in silver dollars and foreign funds were sluggish. Only banknotes, due to a need in Hankou estimated at two to three million, saw active buying and selling in the market and frantic searches by banks. The situation with silver funds and subsidiary currency remained unchanged. Copper coins showed a slight increase, but mostly hovered around the same level.</p>
<p>(Fixed Exchange Rate, Slight Silver Discount) The "foreign exchange rate" remained unchanged from the previous day's afternoon market at 7 mace, 1 fen, and 4 li in both the morning and afternoon sessions. Competition was intense, but buying and selling forces were evenly matched, resulting in a stable situation. The "silver discount" opened at 2 fen in both the morning and afternoon sessions, remaining steady. However, it briefly reached 2.3 fen during the session.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Financial Short-Term Bonds Rise Again to Limit Up</h3>
<p>│More Declines Than Gains in Other Areas│</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 17th), the current market at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was deserted, with only a few types of securities opening throughout the day and sparse trading. The futures market was also less active than before. However, important bonds continued to see significant trading. The 20-year financial short-term bonds experienced extraordinary changes. Due to market demand and scarce selling, the price continued to rise sharply, from 55 yuan in the morning to 58 yuan at the limit up, an increase of 4 yuan from the previous day and a significant jump of 8 yuan over two days, the largest seen this year. The prices of other bonds tended to be stable, with fewer new purchases and sales than before, and more profit-taking transactions. Therefore, the overall market hovered around 6 or 7 jiao, slightly weaker than the previous day with sellers having a slight advantage. Total spot trading was 13,000 yuan, of which demobilization bonds accounted for 10,000 yuan, with the rest being only 1,000 yuan. Futures trading totaled 8.43 million yuan in the morning and afternoon sessions.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Falls Back</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Sun Fook Trading Company, the New York stock market fell back on Friday due to the disastrous drop in the Winnipeg wheat market and the continued weakness of US Steel stocks. The Winnipeg wheat market was weakened by rumors of renewed competition between Argentinian and Canadian wheat abroad, causing widespread panic and selling, leading to a price drop of three cents. However, the stock market's foundation remained solid, preventing a significant decline. Short sellers eventually covered their positions, resulting in mixed gains and losses. The current market situation appears to be quite good, as most stocks are held by genuine investors who are unwilling to sell easily. Total trading volume for the day was 910,000 shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Index | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks | 60.52 | Down 0.64</p>

<h3>Tense Situation in the Yarn, Flower, and Cotton Yarn Market</h3>
<p>丨Strong Speculative Appetite, Increasing Trading Volume丨</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market remains strong, and the situation is still tense. General retail investors are eagerly buying, with a strong desire to go long. However, some manufacturers, due to the current low prices of agricultural products, are also selling off large quantities of cotton yarn. They sold 15,000 to 16,000 bales in the morning session, and the market atmosphere eased slightly in the afternoon session. However, market sentiment remains tight. Spot yarn transactions are brisk, indicating the enthusiasm of speculators.</p>
<p>(Many Bids, Bulls and Bears Confront Each Other) Bidding in the morning session continued the momentum from the previous day, with eager buyers in the market. Fortunately, some manufacturers sold at the market price, slightly easing the market. As a result, each month increased by 1 mace. In the afternoon session, near-term contracts fell slightly by 3.6 qian, while distant contracts remained flat. Total trading volume for the day was 56,300 bales. Sales included: Geng Feng 5,500 bales, Chang Feng 4,550 bales, Yi Yu 2,500 bales, Da Chang 2,500 bales, Mei Ji 2,500 bales, Yuan Da 2,750 bales.

<h3>Cotton Ginned Empty This Month</h3>

<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>On a River Steamer (2)</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>But the old man, after careful consideration, knew that this matter was not easy to handle. First, he had no solid evidence against that person; second, he could not speak plainly, because the old man knew that those who acted along the Yangtze River had companions.</p>
<p>The next day, the river steamer was as calm and uneventful as the river water.</p>
<p>The old man observed the middle-aged man's actions more carefully. He even took the opportunity to talk to the young man in the next room, but all he could say were ordinary words of caution, unable to make the young man fully understand his meaning.</p>
<p>That night, the old man still could not sleep soundly, listening quietly to the sounds from the neighboring room all night, but everything seemed peaceful.</p>
<p>On the third day, the passengers on the ship were still alive and well.</p>
<p>So on the night of the third day, the old man felt more at ease, because by ten o'clock on the morning of the fourth day, the steamer would be able to reach the dock. He thought in bed:</p>
<p>"Maybe nothing will happen. Once I disembark, I can get rid of this responsibility on my conscience. If anything else happens, I won't know anything about it."</p>
<p>The old man drifted off to sleep until four or five o'clock when he suddenly woke up. The old man himself didn't understand why, but he felt a chill down his spine and his heart was trembling. He listened carefully and seemed to hear rustling sounds in the next room, but after a while, everything was quiet again, only the sound of the engine of the steamer traveling on the river. The old man was ice-cold and stiff all over, unable to move, as if a sandman was pressing down on him.</p>
<p>His breathing was rapid, and the old man waited quietly until dawn. There was a commotion on the ship, and many passengers were getting up to prepare to disembark. The old man mustered his courage and got out of bed. He ran to the door of the next room, hesitated, and finally knocked on the door. Inside, it sounded like someone was snoring deliberately. Someone opened the door, it was the middle-aged man. The old man looked into the room and saw no suspicious traces, but the young man was gone. The old man, barely supporting his trembling limbs, still said quietly:</p>
<p>"I've come to see the young man. He asked me yesterday to help him disembark today."</p>
<p>"He just went upstairs. He already told me that we would disembark together. Please don't bother yourself, old man," the middle-aged man replied calmly.</p>
<p>The old man agreed and walked away. He still worried about the young man and searched for him everywhere on the ship, but he couldn't find him. The old man thought:</p>
<p>"That young man is probably still lying quietly in that room, but I'm afraid he's already lifeless."</p>
<p>The old man, above his fear, also felt a kind of excitement. He had no absolute judgment on this matter, but he trusted his own judgment very much. He went to the ship's purser's room and saw an officer in uniform. He said to him:</p>
<h3>The Difficulty of Translation</h3>
<p>— Lin Yutang</p>
<p>In translation theory, there have always been two schools of thought: "literal translation" and "free translation," each with good reasons, leaving those who study translation at a loss. What is meant by literal translation and free translation is quite difficult to understand. Roughly speaking, literal translation means "writing directly" without modification. For example, a common English conversation, "How do you do? I am very well, thank you very much," literally translated would be:</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so: How do you do?</p>
<p>Ms. So-and-so: I am very well. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Or, "They walked arm in arm" literally translated should be: "They walked arm in arm." I find this method of translation very faithful, but it is inevitably too Westernized.</p>
<p>Therefore, I don't quite believe in literal translation, and I advocate another kind of translation. Whether this method is what people call "free translation" or not, there's no need to worry about it. The important thing is to determine what the original text refers to, and translate the corresponding Chinese words. For example, what Westerners call the "First Floor" is clearly the second floor, and in Chinese, it can only be translated as the second floor. Another example is "I have three brothers" can only be translated as "We are four brothers."</p>
<p>However, this method is also quite difficult. For material and concrete names, it is still easy. In abstract concepts, doubts often arise. For example, if a Western newspaper reports that more than 500 people attended a meeting somewhere, and the Chinese translation is "more than 500 people," the reader will inevitably get the impression of 50 or 60 people, so it should be translated as "3,000 people attended the meeting," so that the reader will get the impression of "maybe 400 or 500 people attended the meeting." Another example is that the appointed time "exactly 7 o'clock" should be translated as "5:30 PM," so that everyone attending will definitely achieve the effect of "exactly 7 o'clock." This has been repeatedly tested and proven.</p>
<p>When translating from Chinese into Western languages, even more detailed consideration should be given, otherwise the true meaning will be lost. For example, Chinese high school graduates who go to Berlin to study are admitted to universities as soon as they present their diplomas, precisely because the words "high school" are mistranslated as "Middle School," and Germans believe that "Middle School" is equivalent to the German "Gymnasium," so Chinese high school graduates get too much of an advantage.</p>
<p>In addition, I have thought of a few more examples for reference:</p>
<p>The Chinese word for "train" should be translated into the Western language as "Wheelbarrow."</p>
<p>Military vehicles, often with guards on duty, are not easy to translate, "tank" may be used.</p>
<p>"University president" can be translated as "Shroff" (i.e., the street debt collector hired by foreign firms).</p>
<p>"A small drink" should be translated as "Big Peast," and the Western word "Dinner" can only be translated as "a small drink."</p>
<p>"Wife" can be translated as "Housekeeper"; "concubine" can be translated as "lover"; "family" can be translated as "hotel" or "Boardingbouse."</p>
<p>"Humorous" can be translated as "Trying to be funny."</p>
<p>These are just a few examples, and the rest can be inferred by analogy.</p>
<h3>On the Way to a Funeral</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jiabi</p>
<p>Just before the train started, a chaotic sound poured in through the carriage door, followed by three women and two men who chose seats near the window, forcibly squeezing into them by pushing aside people's clothing. This group of people was dressed casually, as if they had rushed out of their homes without bothering to dress up. Each person's face was covered with a layer of extremely sad black clouds that had cast a shadow over their fate. At the corners of the women's eyes, traces of tears remained, and the older woman's red, swollen eyelids were still filled with heavy tears. They had been temporarily distracted from their heartfelt grief by the crowds and the urgency of getting on the train. When the stationmaster's whistle pierced the passengers' eardrums, everyone remembered the mission of this journey. In their recollection of how the deceased brother, suffering from lung disease in Hangzhou, had hoped that his family would wait for him to recover so they could visit the lake together, the mother, brothers, and sisters were now unable to make it in time to mourn his death. The old woman was the first to cry out, and the others followed, covering their mouths with handkerchiefs as they sobbed. Everyone felt as if they were facing the oppression of "death," and the value of life was impossible to estimate.</p>
<p>After the train passed Jiaxing, the carriage gradually quieted down. The only sound breaking the silence was the rhythmic rolling of the wheels on the rails. The passengers leaned back their heads, each lost in their own dreams. The group of mourners no longer needed to use the ends of their arms to maintain their balance, and sat comfortably, their spirits living a different kind of life. Two of them leaned against the window, gazing at the villages and mountains that flashed by outside the train. Because these two young women had not traveled this route in a long time, they found the lambs in the green grass and the croaking in the ponds particularly interesting. Their faces were angled towards the window, waiting for something new and strange to pass by so they could be the first to turn their heads to admire it. In addition to the sound of the train wheels, one could vaguely hear them arguing about past Qingming Festival nights when they visited the lake. In their memories, they recalled the joyous scene of secretly leaning on their lovers' shoulders in the moonlight, and with their eyes closed, they still felt a burst of intoxication with "life." Their brothers, sitting on the opposite chairs, also faced the window, but shielded their faces with newspapers. They were enjoying the joyous urban life in their fantasies, reading the local supplements: the swaying curves, the soaring fox trots, and Garbo's husky voice. The rhythmic sound of the wheels sent into their ears instinctively made their toes tap along with the waltz beat. The joy of "life" occupied their entire spirits, and they threw all their sorrows into the land of forgetting. The remaining old woman leaned her head against her daughter's back, swaying up and down with the vibrations of the train. Although her eyelids were equally red and swollen, she had fallen soundly asleep. Although she was not as good at forgetting as the young people, she did, at least for a moment of unconsciousness during sleep, shake off the oppression of "death."</p>
<p>The train wheels kept moving forward, carrying five souls to a funeral. They had initially been so frightened by death that they lacked the courage to face "life," but time overcame emotion, and the desire for "life" finally occupied the entire world. In addition to giving mankind various virtues, God gave humans the ability to forget, allowing them to regain balance from extreme sorrow.</p>
<p>The train moved forward, and the active life of humanity relies on this "forgetful" nature to extend into the endless future!</p>
<h3>Strange Tales of Australian Aborigines (2)</h3>
<p>— Wei Han</p>
<p>After the Kurnai Aborigines performed this kind of ritual in public, the newcomer had to live in seclusion in the bushes for several months. During this period, they were monitored by ascetics who watched over them, doing this and that work to hone their self-discipline. Generally speaking, they were very reluctant to let people see such secrets; therefore, it was very difficult to see them. Therefore, this ritual seemed to have a very profound moral effect. When the period of asceticism was about to end, someone would go out to report the news, and then hundreds of people would gather at this sacred place. The ascetic, after a long period of solitary life, was then able to join the crowds; therefore, he was extremely stimulated, and in terms of emotion, there was a sense of soaring ambition. Many crowds then danced and sang vigorously around the ascetic.</p>
<p>At this time, the newcomer would be given moral and religious teachings. The teachings were: do not be willful; if you get something yourself, you must distribute it to friends; you must live peacefully; you must take male and female relationships very seriously; absolutely do not eat forbidden things; you must listen to the advice of the elders, and you must absolutely obey their words. Also, above us, there exists an all-knowing and all-powerful</p>
<h3>Withered String Sounds</h3>
<p>— Ye Jifeng</p>
<p>Every day, every day, she always walks past my building.</p>
<p>Every day, every day, I always watch her walk past my building from upstairs.</p>
<p>In the silent dusk, pale streetlights, and dark shadows of trees, the coolness of early autumn flows.</p>
<p>In the touching homesickness of early autumn evenings, the mournful sound of her sanxian is like a bird without a nest to return to in the evening, wandering in the silent air of dusk.</p>
<p>There is no sheet music, no singing to accompany it, and it is not a sweeping, long performance, only intermittent string sounds strummed casually, but in these fragmented string sounds, infinite sorrow seems to be unconsciously revealed.</p>
<p>A gray-white upper garment, black pants, hair and face indistinctly blurred into a ball, dragging a long, heavy black shadow cast by the streetlights from the gaps between the trees, slowly disappearing at the corner of the road. It seems not to be walking, but moving slowly in a mechanical way.</p>
<p>The figure disappears into the darkness at the corner of the road, and the intermittent string sounds still linger in the silent air of dusk.</p>
<p>Imagining twenty or perhaps thirty years ago, the person drifting on the streets today might have been a stunning beauty who captivated all living beings, but the ruthless years, listening to the turning of the wheel of life, generously withered this masterpiece of creation. Time flows eastward, and the string sounds may still be the string sounds of the past, but the hand plucking the strings is definitely not the slender hand of the past.</p>
<p>In the dusk, leaning on the quiet upstairs, from the chaotic string sounds, watching her wriggling black shadow, I cannot help but feel pity for the ephemeral nature of life.</p>
<p>Every day, every day, she walks past my building like this.</p>
<p>Every day, every day, I watch her walk past my building like this.</p>
<p>Several days of autumn rain have added to the homesickness and melancholy of the traveler's upstairs. Waking up from a nap, watching the rainy streets in the dusk, the lights remain, but in the low, damp air, there is no longer the sound of her strings.</p>
<p>On the first night after the rain cleared, a few fallen leaves blown down by the autumn wind were still wet and stuck to the sloping steps, not flying up. After the streetlights were lit one by one, I leaned lonely on the window. I knew that the string sounds, separated for a few days, would definitely meet again in the shade of the trees tonight.</p>
<p>But the night colors in the shade of the trees gradually deepened, the water accumulated on the sides of the street reflected the autumn stars in the sky, and under the pale streetlights, after the sound of cars subsided, I never saw that heavy black shadow move past again.</p>
<p>On the second night after the rain cleared, the disappearance of the string sounds remained the same.</p>
<p>The fallen leaves in the autumn wind are increasing day by day. Leaning against the upstairs in the evening, facing the desolate new cold, I cannot help but add an unnamed lingering feeling in addition to homesickness.</p>
<p>The autumn wind has been even stronger these few days. Several places on the two trees outside the window have revealed bare trunks. Under the streetlights in the evening, there are only the rustling sounds of colorful fallen leaves, and her string sounds have never been heard again.</p>
<p>The autumn light is old, and the withered string sounds have probably grown old along with this withered autumn light. I sighed in this way.</p>
<p>Every day, every day, I still lean on my upstairs like this.</p>
<p>Every day, every day, I no longer see her walk past my building.</p>
<p>God, He can make it rain, make all things revive, and His voice is thunder. One must try hard to please God on weekdays, otherwise, one cannot ascend to heaven after death. These Aborigines are deeply convinced that practical rituals can produce mystical and supreme effects. When a child finishes the ritual and comes out of the jungle, the first thing he thinks about is getting married.</p>
<p>There is no word for "father" among Australian Aborigines: they call fathers and uncles "Ukapelli" and mothers and aunts "Kaka." Because in the past there was no individual marriage system among these races, all men were common husbands of all women: and this term may be a relic of this so-called promiscuous marriage era. This promiscuous marriage system has now been abolished. Although marriage is now free, first cousins (such as male cousins and female cousins) cannot marry: as for second cousins, it does not matter.</p>
<p>In choosing a wife, everyone is subject to various racial regulations, and the simplest of these is the Kurnai Aborigines. Their race is divided into five factions, and one faction is divided into nineteen parties. The parties are a collection of groups scattered in various places. A group has a family, an old man and his children and grandchildren live together. When choosing a wife, it is absolutely forbidden to marry blood relatives, and everyone cannot marry within their own party, they must choose someone from another party, which is called exogamy.</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of Era and Love 18</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>You can take it to my room for me.</p>
<p>He said as he walked out of the back door of the Zeng's house. On the road, he was still hoping that Mrs. Tsuruko could see this card.</p>
<p>"It's really inexplicable. Why is Mrs. Tsuruko so close to that old Japanese ghost? Could he be her lover? I heard that in Japanese male and female relationships, it's not uncommon for the age difference to be ten or twenty years."</p>
<p>Because of this matter, he seemed unable to be at ease all day today. He thought that he was not in the mood to listen to lectures today. Not only did he feel a kind of unease in his heart, but he also felt a kind of grief that had no name.</p>
<p>"Today is December 2nd, and the Ren family is hosting a wine party on the 5th, which is four days away. If it were tonight, it would be nice to go back later. I really don't want to see that Mrs. Tsuruko! No, I don't want to see those Japanese ghosts!"</p>
<p>The more he thought about it, the more indignant and heartbroken he felt. Sitting in the third-class tram, he really wanted to cry.</p>
<p>"If I really shed tears for this Japanese woman, then my tears would be too cheap!"</p>
<p>Reason and emotion fought in his chest for a while, and the trolleybus stopped at the terminal.</p>
<p>After getting off the tram, he hesitated for a while about whether to walk or hire a rickshaw. He felt that his outlook on life was a little different from yesterday. Yesterday, although he was a bit pessimistic about the world, he still held the tenet of being hardworking, thrifty, and striving to be a good person. But today, after seeing that old Japanese ghost, his old outlook on life suddenly wavered, and he became disheartened about everything in the world, as disheartened as the gray and white color of the sky above his head. As soon as he thought of Mrs. Tsuruko, he hated her so much that he gnashed his teeth and hurriedly shook his head. But sometimes he wanted to copy down a large collection of poems like the one written by Han Hesheng in *Traces of Flowers and the Moon*, "Scratching my head in confusion, I want to ask the heavens," and send it to Mrs. Tsuruko to read. If after reading it, she "had tears welling up in her eyes and dropping down," then that would relieve my anger.</p>
<p>"She is a Japanese woman, how would she understand Chinese poetry! Isn't that like playing the lute to a cow?"</p>
<p>Thinking of this, his heart turned cold again.</p>
<p>A group of rickshaw pullers surrounded him.</p>
<p>"Want a rickshaw?"</p>
<p>"Going to ×× University, want a rickshaw?"</p>
<p>Unconsciously, he jumped into a rickshaw and sat down.</p>
<p>"Forget it. What's the meaning of life! Why bother walking to save ten or twenty cents, making my legs sore and out of breath. I want to change my old outlook on life."</p>
<p>He paid attention and saw that there were also twos and threes of classmates and teachers, each sitting in a rickshaw, braving the cold wind, and speeding towards the university.</p>
<p>Haiquan got out of the rickshaw and had just stepped into the outer gate when he heard the clanging of the class bell. He hurried towards the classroom. The first class today was Professor Wang's differential calculus, and he was a famous teacher who started classes early. Haiquan walked to the entrance of the classroom and saw that there were two or three classmates still standing in the corridor outside the classroom, knowing that Professor Wang had not yet arrived, so he was relieved.</p>

<h3>The Psychology of Worry and Depression</h3>

<p>In the last issue's "Casual Talk," we felt inspired by the generally poor living environment and wanted to find a positive way out to break the current state of depression. We believed that since everyone suffered the same oppression, the liberation from this oppression could not be achieved by the efforts of one or two people alone. Therefore, we suggested that we should first start with organized research, discuss various strategies that require joint efforts to transform the situation, and make practical attempts as soon as there are some results. However, in the past five or six days, we have received many letters from readers. On the one hand, they acknowledge the necessity for like-minded shop assistants and apprentices to unite, but on the other hand, they still feel that the future of such uncertain unity is extremely bleak. The words are filled with tones of worry and depression. This kind of depressed psychology is too important, and it is very necessary to bring it up for discussion seriously.</p>
<p>We should deeply understand that in the current situation where foreign enemies have already entered our homes and the domestic politics are still extremely chaotic, and the people's livelihood is extremely poor, the so-called worry and depression are actually a natural result. It is a kind of feeling that any thoughtful young person should have. Otherwise, what difference is there between them and a group of people who live in a drunken dream, have no feeling for the survival of the country and the nation, and live like parasites? However, we should recognize that worry is different from pessimism. Pessimism is the result of discouragement, while worry arises from dissatisfaction with the status quo and implies a consciousness of seeking a way out. Therefore, worry can also be said to be the vanguard of transforming the status quo. Every improvement in the status quo can be said to be the result of efforts made after each period of worry, that is, a kind of true, supreme happiness after worry. However, what we must pay close attention to is that after worry and depression, people often easily fall into pessimism, corruption, and a lack of motivation. Those who can actively struggle after worry and do not enter a path of negativity and decadence can only be achieved by those with considerable knowledge and perseverance.</p>
<p>Therefore, here, we must clearly recognize that the great path to resolving worry is the pursuit of knowledge and the cultivation of a spirit of struggle. It requires effort to achieve. The broader and more complex the problem of worry, the more knowledge is needed, and the slower the progress will be. We should have perseverance, gather like-minded people, and work together. Only with "where there is a will, there is a way" can we solve this worry one day. The happiness of a successful endeavor after many difficulties is naturally very great.</p>
<p>The most important danger we must guard against when we are worried is not taking the path of knowledge pursuit, but succumbing to the environment, being lazy to struggle, seeking temporary peace, until our will declines, we become discouraged, and we follow the crowd until we stop. This is a point that we should pay close attention to, whether we are working hard to improve our personal lives or expanding to reform public undertakings in society.</p>
<p>Finally, we feel that our current worries are mostly about personal prospects, and most of them depend on our own efforts first. Although some people say that these many personal prospects are caused by the current situation of the entire society, the country, and even the whole world, the individual is the foundation of society, a tributary in the ocean of society. If personal problems cannot be adequately resolved by our own efforts first, how can we have the experience, knowledge, and spirit to do greater work to reform society in the future?</p>

<h3>Why are Shop Assistants Slow to Serve Customers?</h3>
<p>— You Ping</p>
<p>The Problem of Shop Assistants Neglecting Customers</p>
<p>Whether people in cities or villages, when they come back from shopping, they are probably always criticizing the poor service of shop assistants. In fact, if we analyze the matter of shop assistants neglecting customers from a fair perspective, we cannot unilaterally blame them. We should consider it a kind of reaction under the current capitalist system. Because the motivation for neglecting customers is partly due to the fact that they have not received high-level education and sufficient self-cultivation. However, the capitalists cannot lightly shirk their responsibility either. Because they do not have the courage and power to resist the high pressure from above, they have no choice but to adopt the method of non-violent resistance, venting their implicit anger on the customers to reduce the store's business.</p>
<p>Originally, any pure young person would want to be an accomplished and respected person. It is only because the environment is too bad that they have to be forced to take the path of being criticized. Driven by life, they abandon school, sell their whole body and mind to the capitalists, and are driven like slaves in order to earn meager salaries to maintain the livelihood of themselves and their families. You think, this is already so pitiful! But the capitalists do not understand, and even more brutally destroy them, arbitrarily extending their working hours, depriving them of the entertainment they should have in life, and preventing them from improving their personal studies. In addition, the surrounding snobs look down on them with contempt, which makes them fundamentally doubt the meaning of life, and feel that the world is unpredictable, as if they are in a society that is both cruel and lacks compassion. Because of this concept infiltrating their minds, a sense of injustice arises in their hearts and is manifested on their faces, and finally creates the so-called "neglecting customers" incident.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare to assert that if we want to completely change the attitude of shop assistants, we must raise their salaries, transform their environment, revitalize their lives, and enrich their personality. Otherwise, any criticism or sarcasm will absolutely not change their abnormal psychology. However, under the existing social system, how easy is it to transform it?</p>

<h3>An Experiment in Improving Leisure Life</h3>
<p>— Ms. Ouyang Jinping</p>
<p>(Volunteer Teacher in a Shop)</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, my uncle was in Hangzhou, preparing to open a small-scale tea shop. The shop employed a total of seventeen or eight employees, of which apprentices accounted for two-thirds. Speaking of these dozen or so apprentices, they were all from poor backgrounds and had only read two or three elementary school Chinese textbooks, which could be considered to have some basic literacy. Although their jobs were low, several of them were ambitious and hoped to improve themselves. Because they wanted to study but had no money for tuition, after work at 7 o'clock every day, they only had a copy of the newspaper and read a few simple news reports. Sometimes, they were fascinated and read aloud while watching. However, due to their low level, the reading inevitably contained many mistakes. My uncle found it amusing to hear them mispronounce words, such as "He Ying Ci (misreading of the character 'Qin') arrived in Hankou!" "Neng (misreading of the character 'Xiong') Shihui appointed Garrison (misreading of the character 'Shu') Commander!" Therefore, my uncle's motivation to organize a night school arose. One day, he said to the apprentices, "Your level of reading newspapers is not up to par yet, but would you like to concentrate on tutoring? I am willing to sacrifice two hours every day to fulfill a little bit of guidance. However, you must have perseverance!" No one objected at the time. My uncle was also pleased to see their eagerness to learn. Because the shop was not large and the goods were crowded, he rented a small room next to the shop as a classroom. He also allocated a portion of the profits from the surplus as rent. These profits were willingly sacrificed and used by the shop employees. From then on, they had classes every night, and within two years, they had completed the elementary school curriculum. Now, every apprentice has the knowledge of junior high school. The pronunciation is certainly much more accurate than before; when it comes to abacus and written calculations, they are also skilled. Although my uncle is not a great scholar who patiently teaches, he cannot talk about any honor. However, at least he has won the apprentices' warm gratitude, and they often want to find a way to repay him. And the only way to repay is: for all the big and small shop affairs during the day, they all work harder, washing away the bad habit of ordinary shops of being idle after eating their fill!</p>
<p>I believe that Shanghai is a commercial port, and the low-level employees of several self-proclaimed large companies and shops may not have sufficient knowledge. Have the managers prepared any remedies for them? Undoubtedly, they themselves are tied up with official duties and have no time to take on teaching duties. However, at least they should hire an experienced teacher to teach the employees ordinary skills. As the English proverb says: "With sufficient commercial knowledge, there will be sufficient commercial development!" Shop owners, please implement it quickly!</p>

<h3>Taking Advantage</h3>
<p>— Ying Hui</p>
<p>The incident happened in the workshop. At that time, I was doing the sweeping work, a small worker in the cloth machine room of the ×× yarn factory. There were so many young women in the factory, several hundred. Right where I was sweeping, there was a very beautiful young woman, only sixteen years old. She had been working in the factory for only two weeks. Some people called her the factory flower. I didn't understand what "factory flower" meant at first, but later I learned that it was because her appearance was considered the most beautiful in the whole factory. Speaking of beauty, it was precisely because of her beauty that this happened. The rice buckets, the foreman, big and small, were always staring at her with red eyes. When I saw this situation, I got angry, and the way they looked became more and more disgusting, as if they wanted to swallow her alive.</p>
<p>Her name was Zhang Hongdi, and her number was sixty-two.</p>
<p>I could see that something was not right. Just as expected, I soon discovered that the foreman was flirting with her. The three rice buckets wanted to, but their position was lower than the foreman, so they didn't dare to offend him and let him do it alone. I had seen it coming all along. Sure enough, half an hour before the end of work, he actually started to flirt with Zhang Hongdi. Before, I couldn't catch him doing anything wrong, but this time I clearly heard him say those shameless words: "Little sister, are you tired?"</p>
<p>He put on a smiling face, showing his concern. The little sister ignored him and kept working.</p>
<p>"Sixty-two, are you deaf?" he said again, but the little sister still ignored him. Good, I admired her in my heart. But, I hated the foreman to death and cursed in my heart: "What a decent bastard!" Really, he was forty years old, and the little sister was only sixteen. God knows what was going on. To put it bluntly, she was even younger than his granddaughter. I was angry. He was simply not human, I wasn't wronging him. People ignored him, but he still went forward, saying: "Don't talk, hum, what are you pretending for?"</p>
<p>But good little sister, he was given the cold shoulder again, I was really happy. "After work, let's hang out, okay?"</p>
<p>How about that, that's exactly what it was! He really had the audacity of heaven. I couldn't wait to punch him so that he would fall flat on his back, and say to him: "Do you dare to do it again?" He was not human, he was even worse than a beast. Could people or animals tolerate him?</p>
<p>"Don't be shy, it doesn't matter," he said again. It was simply deceiving the heavens. What kind of talk was that! Alas! The factory was really not a place for people to go. A good woman was easily taken advantage of by bad people as soon as she started working. The foreman, he was so heinous!</p>
<p>"Go away!" I heard this sentence from the little sister was very decisive and powerful. Her face was full of anger. Sixteen years old, she was just a child, how could she stand this? I saw that her eyes were a little red. I was sad, and I thought, I wonder what bad things the previous generation did that required her to suffer such a crime! I don't know if her parents are still alive? If she has parents, and they know that their child is being bullied, what should they do?······ Thinking of this, the foreman turned and walked to the side, and I put this matter down and continued to sweep the floor with a stomach full of anger. For this half day, I stopped working involuntarily. Fortunately, God blessed me and didn't let the rice bucket see me stop working, otherwise, I would probably be fined two yuan, at least two yuan. But how can I eliminate the anger in my stomach? And why should I be angry for others, meddling in other people's business? Forget it. No, I can't forget it, it's just squatting in my stomach and rolling back and forth.</p>
<p>Before long, it was the end of work, which was a relief for me. God, I should have calmed down. No, things are not like that at all. Picking up the lunch box and walking downstairs, I had to hide behind Hongdi for a section of the road. It seemed that I knew something was going to happen.</p>
<p>But things were really coincidental!! After leaving the factory gate, I turned a corner and saw the foreman standing in an alley in the distance. Ah, good thing, he was waiting here, and he must have had ill intentions in his heart. I wanted to see, see what was going on. So I found a place to hide and peek. The other workers were walking home in groups. This matter seemed to be sucking me in, and my legs just couldn't move. The anger in my heart grew even bigger, and the anger was bursting out. At this time, I guessed that things would not end well after all. Alas ! Little sister is so pitiful! Does she have to be bullied because she has a good appearance? Why doesn't God give her an ugly face? Sixteen years old, a girl who is only sixteen years old, how will she live in the future? It's a pity that the little sister has no companions and is walking alone. It's dangerous! What to do? I was anxious for her. Sure enough, the foreman blocked her way. He knew what to say</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>I ran behind him in a few steps. He said, "Little sister, let's go out and have some fun."</p>
<p>"I'm not going!" The little sister said and wanted to walk forward, but he grabbed her hand.</p>
<p>"Little girl, I insist that you go if you don't want to!" He frightened her and dragged her away. The little sister tried to pull away. But she couldn't pull away. At this time, could I still stand by? No, I had to find a way to help her get out of trouble! I clenched my fist, really wanted to jump over and slap him, and then, regardless of the consequences, beat him half to death! But then I thought, no, this would stop my work! What if I was fired, and had to suffer again! I couldn't think anymore, he was dragging her so urgently. "Taking advantage! Taking advantage! Taking advantage!" I was so anxious that I couldn't think of a way, so I shouted three times in a row. There were still many workers on the street, and they immediately saw this incident and ran over, watched, and tightly surrounded the two people. People, layer upon layer, were airtightly surrounded. I was also one of them. This time the foreman let go of his hand. The little sister cried, and people asked her in a chaotic manner. She told everyone about the foreman taking advantage of her, crying and weeping. After she finished speaking, she didn't seem to know what to do.</p>
<p>"You motherfucker!" I heard such a sentence, and then something flew in from behind. I saw blood on the foreman's face. I didn't see what hit him, and no one cared about that. They just watched the foreman in pain and felt happy. At this time, the foreman didn't know what to do either. He couldn't escape, couldn't stand up, and held his hand on the bleeding area of his face.</p>
<p>"Beat him to death!"</p>
<p>"Oppose taking advantage!"</p>
<p>Someone shouted like this. At this time, he couldn't say a word, and his body was shaking a little. Someone really did it. Three young men jumped into the crowd, "slap slap" beat him up, and heard him say "ouch, ouch" a few times and lay down on the ground. Things got big. The three people squeezed out of the crowd after beating him. They were gone, couldn't find their shadows. But the crowd still didn't disperse and was still watching the excitement. Then came a sound of car horns, and a police car drove over from a distance. The car stopped in front of the crowd, and three Chinese police officers came down. People automatically parted a path and let them walk into the circle. The little sister had stopped crying a long time ago,</p>
<p>At this time, she was telling the police about her things. I watched what they were going to do. Later, the two people went to the police station together in the car. Someone served the foreman when he got into the car. He was moaning. I felt a sigh of relief when I saw this. After all, evil people have evil rewards, and the foreman will not be good. I felt happy to beat him. I said that I didn't mean to cover the foreman's eggs. I couldn't really get over it without shouting for a while! A shout caused this big thing! It's good, it's considered to have saved Zhang Hongdi. The foreman and rice buckets usually always bullied others. It's really not okay not to teach them a lesson! In the future, you have to be more careful when taking advantage.</p>
<p>The sixty-two little sister came to work again the next day. But the foreman was injured and detained, so the factory stopped his business.</p>
<p>Self-Employment Introduction</p>
<h3>Starting Over</h3>
<p>— Ms. Qin</p>
<p>Because of my family's poverty, in the year I graduated from elementary school, I knew that my strength was weak, and I did not dare to harbor any extravagant hopes of entering university. I decided to enter a vocational high school, preparing to find a suitable job in society in the future to solve the problem of livelihood.</p>
<p>Sure enough, I graduated from vocational high school and found a job. However, under the influence of the Shanghai War, unfortunately, the company I served was also lost in the war zone, and I had no choice but to return to my hometown. How miserable! I don't know how many people have been given the gift of the imperialist aggressors' policies!</p>
<p>Later, the ceasefire agreement was signed, and the prosperity of Shanghai gradually recovered. Although the bloodstains of Songhu had not yet dried, I am afraid that the shocking impression of a few months ago was only lingering in the minds of a few people. I, who had been unemployed for several months, had almost gone to the point of desperation step by step. So I could only start over and come to the sea again.</p>
<p>After suffering great emotional stress, I found a place to eat. Although I felt that what I had learned was not being used, I was forced by the problem of bread, so what could I do but "force myself to do it"?</p>
<p>I have been working for half a year now. Not to mention the salary, just in terms of the position I hold, I only feel it is boring and unconscious. A person cannot do well in things that they are not interested in. So I want to find a job that suits me.</p>
<p>What I would like to do is Chinese and English typing or secretarial work. Based on my past experience, I am confident that I can be competent in the above two items. However, because I lack an introduction, I have no choice but to learn from Mao Sui's self-recommendation, and ask your publication to give me an opportunity to disclose. At the same time, if any foreign or local companies or other institutions that need this kind of talent send a letter, I hope you will notify me at any time, and I will be very grateful.</p>

<h3>Do We Recognize the Puppet State?</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I am a trainee at a money shop. Recently, I discovered a serious incident in my duties, namely that the drafts entrusted by customers to be sent to the three northeastern provinces are all printed with the words "Year 1 of Datong, Month XX, Day XX" and affixed with the "Great Manchurian State" stamp tax. My colleagues do not pay attention to this and continue to receive and pay as usual. I believe that when the puppet state was established, the people of the country ran around and called for its denial. The righteous army fought bloody battles to recover the lost land. Our country's representatives attending the League of Nations, as well as the countries of the world that uphold justice, expressed their grand theories, hoping that the country would be overthrown. However, the financial institutions in our country, which occupy an important position in the international market, turn a blind eye to it, as if they have tacitly approved it, which is ridiculous! This shows the people of our country's negligence in the matter. Furthermore, if disputes arise with these bills in the future, I believe that the court will also refuse to accept them. I ask for your wise opinion as to whether this is the case. I originally intended to present this situation to the Money Industry Committee, but I am afraid that my words are of little consequence and may not be moving. Therefore, I have no choice but to ask your publication to give me a corner to publish it to the public, hoping that all circles will pay attention to it, and I beg you to send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Money Industry Association to take measures to ban it, as necessary. Sincerely, Hu Ruian</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Since the September 18th Incident occurred last year, everyone knows that our country and nation have reached the most dangerous juncture. If we do not work hard to fight, we can only sit and wait for death. However, what has been the effect in the past fifteen months? It is nothing more than the gradual loss of territory, the successive loss of fortresses, the market is full of inferior goods, and cash is flowing to the east. What is this phenomenon? We can't bear to say it!</p>
<p>Although the livers and brains of most of our compatriots in the three northeastern provinces have been turned into dust under the iron hooves of the slaves! The prosperous streets of Zhabei have been turned into the ashes of the Japanese slaves' artillery fire!·······Alas! What do these, these count for? How can they awaken the delusion of those who only seek profit!</p>
<p>This is not us talking nonsense in the house. The short letter from Mr. Hu above is an excellent proof. We do not want to say much about this matter (and we can't bear to talk about it in detail). We earnestly hope that all money shops in this city will pay special attention to it. At the same time, we hope that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Money Industry Association will have a thorough solution.</p>

<p>The Sea Magazine says: Deer antler is a kind of thing. The world praises the northeast, but the method of production in the north is better. The quality is really not as good as the thickest produced in the west. Others, such as those produced in Jing County, Huguang, are slightly inferior. Those produced in Danshan, Hainan, without branches, are also inferior. A kind of sand deer produced in freshwater places overseas is transformed by sharks. Its color is dry and white and large. There are many branches, and it cannot be used for velvet. This is the worst. Others, such as Fujian, Shaanxi, and Quzhou, all produce it. All can be used for velvet. Change the name to Daodi. Those produced in Japan are called foreign velvet. It is the worst. Not used for medicinal purposes.</p>

<h3>Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>Wei Yanhe wrote to ask: I have suffered from nocturnal emission for two years. It occurs and heals from time to time. After falling asleep, my ears ring and I have headaches. My spirit is very tired. If I work for too long, I feel even more tired. My memory is weak. I have taken various drugs to stop nocturnal emission, but they have had little effect. I think there must be many patients with this disease. I dare to ask your agency to indicate the cause and treatment. Not only will I benefit, but patients with the same disease will also be grateful.</p>
<p>Answer: The disease of nocturnal emission is indeed a common disease among young people. There are many who have asked this publication. Here is a general answer for the patients' attention.</p>
<p>During the period of male puberty, the semen in the testicles gradually becomes abundant. When the fluid is full, it overflows. The Inner Canon says, "A man is sixteen years old and his kidney qi is strong. The essence qi overflows." Therefore, occasional nocturnal emission is not a disease. It is really because the essence qi is strong and the bone overflows. It is not a disease. Nowadays, men often have nocturnal emission once a month, thinking that this is a serious symptom of nocturnal emission. If they linger for a long time, they will definitely become consumptive. They send letters to inquire, unaware that the fluid overflows when it is full, and has absolutely no bearing on the body. If there are two or three or four or five nocturnal emissions in a month, or even one every other day, then this is truly what is called nocturnal emission. According to recent inquiries, seven or eight out of ten cases of nocturnal emission are mostly caused by masturbation. When a man reaches puberty, his pursuit of all thoughts is occasionally biased, and he is prone to this disease. When he first suffers from it, a young man with a strong body does not feel any pain. Over time, it becomes a habit. Some people even cannot fall asleep without masturbating once a day. They do not know that it is more harmful to their body and depletes their fluids. After a long time, even if they realize it, they have already suffered from the painful disease of nocturnal emission. After masturbating for a long time, the essence gate gradually becomes weak, and the yin fluid is deficient, and the fire of the minister is easily exuberant. Therefore, even if they realize it and can repent and correct their mistakes, they still have nocturnal emission from time to time. Is it not painful? However, there are also those who have nocturnal emission due to excessive use of the brain and the heart fire falling into the kidneys. Although there are occasional cases in the disease inquiry letters, there are not many. The above symptoms, for those who have nocturnal emission due to masturbation, take eight-flavor Rehmannia pill three qian with salt water every morning. For those who have nocturnal emission due to the heart fire falling into the kidneys, take six-flavor Rehmannia pill three qian with boiled water every day. If there is one nocturnal emission per month, this is called overflowing essence and does not require medication. There are still others with or without dreams, which is due to the different pathological roots of the heart and kidneys. Due to limited space, I cannot answer them one by one. I will write a special article to explain them in detail.</p>
<h3>Hernia</h3>
<p>Chen Chuqing wrote to ask: My right testicle is swollen and large. It has been like this for many days. It can shrink when I sleep. It can also shrink when I press it with my hand. I have taken small intestine hernia pills, but they have no effect. Please tell me how to treat it. Briefly answer: The swelling and enlargement of the right testicle without pain is caused by insufficient middle qi and damp-heat flowing downwards. Here is a pill formula for you: Jisheng orange seed pill, take three qian with boiled water each time.</p>
<h3>Small Tidbits of Knowledge</h3>
<p>▲Bad Breath</p>
<p>The disease of bad breath. Is particularly troublesome in social situations. Often, in gatherings of distinguished guests where conversations flow freely, even if one's politeness and words are perfectly appropriate, a peculiar odor subtly emanates, inevitably causing others to frown. The cause of this ailment is often due to unresolved heat accumulation in the stomach and intestines, rising liver fire, and constipation. Taking one qian of Angelica and Aloe Pill with salt water every morning allows the accumulated heat to descend, leading to recovery.</p>
<p>▲Acne</p>
<p>Many women suffer from acne due to applying lead-based powder. Rubbing with Cuscuta seed juice will cure it.</p>
<p>▲Acid Reflux</p>
<p>Vomiting after eating, with hidden pain in the stomach. After years of treatment, various medications prove ineffective. Consuming fresh lychees is remarkably effective. If fresh lychees are unavailable, dried lychees can also be used.</p>
<p>Collected Talks on Blood Diseases</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge of Blood Disorders (5)</h3>
<p>— Ding, Ji, Hua</p>
<p>Coughing Blood</p>
<p>The lung governs Qi. Coughing is a disease of the Qi aspect, hence it belongs to the lung. The lung also manages respiration and externally connects to the skin and hair. External attack of wind and cold causes the skin and hair to close tightly, preventing the lung Qi from flowing smoothly. Internal brewing of heat rises and stimulates. The lung resides at the peak of the five organs, suffering excessive punishment from heat. The blood vessels suddenly rupture, therefore those who cough severely may occasionally see blood. This is heat forcing the blood out, caused by wind and cold invading and the Qi mechanism not flowing. This is what Zhongjing referred to as "coughing with audible panting, severely leading to vomiting blood."</p>
<p>Those with warm, hot, damp and summerheat illnesses can also cough blood because of it. The symptoms are headache, fever, dry mouth, and difficulty urinating, similar to an external contraction of wind and cold. However, this disease is caused by turbid evils entering through the mouth and nose, infiltrating the channels, accumulating between the membranes of the stomach and intestines. The heat stimulates the vessels to rupture, and blood spills from the back into the stomach. The stomach is the place where phlegm is produced. The phlegm goes up with the cough, leading to coughing blood. This is different from the cough caused by wind and cold attacking the skin and then entering the internal organs. These cannot be discussed in the same breath.</p>
<p>For those who cough blood with prolonged coughing and shortness of breath, the lung is shaken by the prolonged coughing, causing Qi to rise upwards in urgency. When Qi rebels, it ignites the fire of the various meridians and the blood of the chest and back channels. Being shaken, the blood comes out with the cough. This condition is often seen in elderly people with prolonged coughs, and is especially severe in cold weather. Because the winter climate is cold. The cough root originates from the lungs receiving cold. Normally, due to climate regulation, the disease symptoms can still be supported. However, upon encountering cold weather, the cold inhaled into the lungs combines with the old disease, making the illness more serious. In winter, the skin and hair are tightly closed, and most breathing is done through the mouth and nose. The cold inhaled through the mouth and nose directly affects the lungs first. Therefore, the disease becomes more severe. It is difficult to estimate the number of older people with Qi rebellion and prolonged coughing who cough blood that is discovered in winter. This condition is most easily mistaken for external contraction coughing blood. If doctors mistreat it, it often leads to consumption and tuberculosis. Be careful, be careful.</p>
