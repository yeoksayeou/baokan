<h3>時评</h3>
<h3>由訓政達到「眞」憲政之質疑彬</h3>
<p>自滬變突發。國難益臻嚴重以來。國人要求主政之國民黨公開政權。予人民以共赴國難之機之呼聲。乃一時甚囂塵上。日前汪精衛氏來滬。四日五日曾在報端連續發表談話。於内政外交多所解答。而於民主政治與由訓政到憲政之政治制度問題一點。則尤反覆解說。其發言顯然爲就政府之立塲。針對公開政權一要求。作非正式之解答。至足令吾人重視。今請就汪氏談話中關於政治制度一點。提出數點疑問。謹以質諸汪氏。并以供國人之共同商討。　　我國在滿淸末葉。即曾一度預備「立憲。」初定九年。後改六年。呼聲未絶。而淸社已屋。迄於民國。在北洋軍閥時代。復曾一度實行所謂「憲政。」倣效西歐欲樹立僞德謨克拉西政治之根基於中國。畫虎未成。亦歸覆滅。此則過去之事實。足以爲今日當局之殷鑑者也。</p>
<p>國民黨自主政以來。儼然以國民之褓姆自任。認爲非由訓政决不能進入憲政。其訓政綱領第四條有云。「治權之行政立法司法考試監察五項。付託於國民政府總攬而執行之。以立憲政時期民選政府之基礎。」故國家大政。操於黨政府之掌握。甚且握於黨中少數人之手。吾人則認爲與其抑制人民處於不自由不平等之地位。訓之以政。毌寗使其自已訓練自已。俾其由創造而達到成熟。被訓之效力。遠不及自訓徵。徵之中外史乘。歷歷不爽。退一步言。國民黨旣以國民之褓姆自任。但吾人認爲必褓姆本身健全。而後可以求嬰孩之健全。若褓姆而病入膏盲。而欲嬰孩之健全。詎其能得。今日當局以國民之褓姆自任。固亦曾一反省其本身之健全否乎。國民黨主政今已六載。人民馴服受訓。亦已三年。訓政之效果究安在乎。即就政府本身總攬之五權而言。權勢依庇。遑言考試。軍閥横暴。幾見監察。立法徒爲紙上談兵。司法尤爲每况愈下。行政則黑漆一團。又訓政時期之基本工作。如地方自治。亦但聞其聲。未見其行。政治之紊亂。人民遭受壓迫之深重。較之北洋軍閥時代有過之無不及。如謂「民十二以前爲有名無實之憲政。」則今日之訓政。獨非爲「有名無實」之訓政乎。握政權於一黨之手。甚且握於少數人之手。使人民根本無過問政治之機會。此則所謂訓政。特變相之專制耳。由於若是「有名無實」之訓政。果能達到「眞」憲政之境域乎。</p>
<p>凡此種種。皆爲當前之實際問題。吾人深盼我政府我國人。都以國家利益爲前提。而平情商討以共求出路。毌徒各就本身之利益而打算。互相爭持。以各趨於異端。</p>

<p>史汀生力持反對理由</p>
<p>胡佛將否决交付複議</p>
<p>路透四日華盛頓電美國衆議院今日通過規定菲列濱可於今後八年内獨立之議案、農黨見此案通過、頗爲欣幸、以爲目前免稅進口之農產、將來當可徵稅、但國務卿史汀生於今日發表一函、反對甚力、謂美國對於菲島如撤銷指導地位、則菲島勢必發生經濟政治與社會上之混亂、終必爲日本或他國所宰割、美國若脫離匪島、無異表示其懦怯與無能、而美國在遠東之威望、必不免於喪落、因美國此舉、幾等於放棄美國所擔任保護之區域也云、</p>
<p>國民四日華盛頓電美衆院今日以三○六票對四七票、通過海爾氏菲列濱獨立案、該案規定菲島經八年過渡時代後、可不必經過國民大會、即成爲獨立地位、今日在衆院討論四十分鐘後、即表决通過、惟國會中贊成者雖若是衆多、而胡佛總統態度、逆料在此時期、定將否决菲島獨立之任何法案、蓋自去年陸長視察菲島後、總統與陸長俱已表示意見、認該島猶未充分進步、可許以完全獨立、故料此案之眞正試騐、將在總統否决後退還複議之際、目下投贊成票者、僅爲自私的本國利益起見、未能顧全大局、而一般製糖業尤亟願該島獨立、俾可高築關稅障壁、冀獲昭蘇機會、今此案若經總統否决後、但國務卿史汀生於今日發表一函、反對甚力、謂美國對於菲島如撤銷指導地位、則菲島勢必發生經濟政治與社會上之混亂、終必爲日本或他國所宰割、美國若脫離菲島、無異表示其懦怯與無能、而美國在遠東之威望、必不免於喪落、因美國此舉、幾等於放棄美國所擔任保護之區域也云、</p>
<p>國民四日華盛頓電美衆院今日以三○六票對四七票、通過海爾氏菲列濱獨立案、該案規定菲島經入年過渡時代後、可不必經過國民大會、即成爲獨立地位、今日在衆院討論四十分鐘後、即表决通過、惟國會中贊成者雖若是衆多、而胡佛總統態度、逆料在此時期、定將否决菲島獨立之任何法案、蓋自去年陸長視察菲島後、總統與陸長俱已表示意見、認該島猶未充分進步、可許以完全獨立、故料此案之眞正試騐、將在總統否决後退還複議之際、目下投贊成票者、僅爲自私的本國利益起見、未能顧全大局、而一般製糖業尤亟願該島獨立、俾可高築關稅障壁、冀獲昭蘇機會、今此案若經總統否决後、則將來複議之際、勢必接攏許多共和黨議員、爲總統後盾、其結果亦正難逆料也</p>
<h3>東報對史汀生函之反響</h3>
<p>路透五日東京電今晚各報皆於顯著之地位、登載美國務卿史汀生關於菲列濱島獨立問題之函、政界似甚以美衆院通過菲島獨立案爲異、蓋衆院曾有從不視菲島獨立問題爲最近將來之實際的建議也、史汀生恐准許菲島獨立後、日本有加宰割之可能、日人謂此種恐慌、實無根據、衆信如美國願許菲島獨立、則日本願締結協定、擔保其獨立、日人深以史汀生之函含有帝國主義之語調爲異、謂讀此函者、决不信與近致參議員波拉氏之函出於同一手筆云、</p>
<h3>俄行政會主席揭破列强陰謀</h3>

<p>亡命白俄回國活動</p>
<p>路透社五日里加電人民委員行政會主席摩洛托夫、今日在莫斯科發極有關係之演說、謂某某帝國主義之大國、現正計議攫取遠東蘇俄之土地、彼數國者、謀建一白俄緩衝國、以爲繼續進攻蘇俄之立足點、蘇俄急宜作抵抗之準備云云、　　國民社五日巴黎電此問政界接聞莫斯科消息、亡命白俄刻正準備在遠東活動後、爲之一驚、據俄報載稱、上海白俄報紙已接巴黎電稱、由某某兩大公代表齊伏羅度夫敎授署名、宣布其大公立將啓程赴滬、籌備在西伯利亞沿海省建設一緩衝國、同行者有捷克斯拉夫人迦達將軍、與隨員多迦達將軍、於一九一九年至一九二十年間各國出兵西伯利亞時、曾爲一重要主角、嗣即隱居本國、此次將統率白俄隊伍、將來新國成立後、即爲總司令云、</p>

<h3>英法竟日會商</h3>
<p>對多瑙河問題</p>
<p>獲有充妥諒解</p>
<p>泰狄歐乘輪返巴黎</p>
<p>路透四日倫敦電英閣員今日與法總理等、集議於唐寗街十號英首相官邸、討論歐洲大局、尤注重多瑙河諸國之問題、其所議及者、包括經濟財政政治等事件、歷六小時始散會、與會者英方爲首相麥诏唐納·外相西門·財相張伯倫·商部大臣任錫曼、法方爲總理泰狄歐·財長佛蘭亭、第一次集議自上午十時至午後一時、後又自二時半集議、至晚五時止、今晚發出官方公報、謂英法當局皆認其所研究之問題、僅可藉國際協定解决之、因是之故、星期三日討論此問題之四大國間、必須有密切與親善之合作、四國大會旣即將舉行、故英法當道現下欲成立任何協定、惟覺雙方互換意見、可便利大會之工作、英法政府咸望能迅速成立公同辦法、於尊重第三方面合法利益之下、使多瑙河諸國間有經濟諒解之可能、以及便利多瑙河流域内平衡與安穩狀態之恢復云、晚間路透記者進謁首相麥唐納、麥聲明今日之談判殊稱順利、初步之探討、現已告完畢、各代表間有充分諒解、皆决計努力於四國會議内進行協定計畫、英法閣員深信於協定内、各方利益儘可包括無餘、麥首相希望會議所得結果、能使各參預國互相信認、庶可戮力同心、以友好精神解决今夏所須解决之種種問題、聞各國鑑於今日會議之成功、嗣後或將舉行同樣會議、用以解决歐洲難題、散會後、泰狄歐仍留英首相官邸、與麥唐納作私人談話、旋往晤前外相李定勳爵、晚間赴倫頓狄利勳爵之宴會、宴會畢、即乘輪返巴黎、聞今日會議未有正式决議、英法雙方均可自由修改意見、官方表示希望四國會議、能於最短期間内成立協定、蓋多瑙河諸國情形甚窘、其間一二國有經濟崩潰之危險、補救辦法未容稍緩也、今日會議席上、法代表曾表示恢復歐戰前協約之希望云、</p>
<p>路透四日巴黎電巴黎時報稱、倫敦之英法談判、範圍甚廣、除多瑙河問題外、賠欵及縮减每上軍備等問題、亦在討論之列、尤注意設法成立法意間關於海上軍縮之協定、聞法國對於關稅事、已提議在七月間英帝國經濟會議以前開始談判云、</p>
<p>歐洲四國會議</p>
<h3>今日在英外部舉行</h3>
<p>哈瓦斯四日倫敦電外部宣稱、四强會議之第一次集會、將於星期三下午二時三十分在外部舉行、首相麥唐納·外相西門·財相張伯倫·商部大臣任錫曼代表英國、佛蘭亭財長及其專門委員代表法國、外次蒲洛代表德國、外長格蘭第代表意大利、亦各有專門委員隨同出席、格蘭第定於明日到此、蒲洛於星期三八時三十分可到、會議約開至本星期末爲止、</p>
<p>國民社四日柏林電德國出席多瑙河會議代表、由外交次長蒲洛領袖、今夜自柏林啓程、將先往喀爾斯魯愛與總理白魯寗晤商後、再於明晚動身赴倫敦、聞蒲洛在倫敦會議畢、即將逕赴日内瓦、出席國聯理事會、白魯寗因辦理選舉、將稍緩赴日内瓦、大約須至十四日方能成行、　　哈瓦斯四日羅馬電意大利外長格蘭第、晨間晋謁首相墨索里尼、旋於午後二時啓程前往倫敦、以代表意大利出席四國會議、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯四日羅馬電四强會議開會時、意大利之態度如何、則觀於意大利之備忘錄可以知之、意政府在該備忘錄中宣稱、意大利所以關心多瑙河問題者、不僅因其爲强國之一、且因其爲奥匈帝國繼承人故也、意大利又爲多瑙河流域各國進出口市塲、並握有多瑙河各邦所需要之海口、意大利當爲奥匈兩國辯護、兩國有所需要、意大利在日内瓦復爲之援助、俾能滿足其希望、意大利所以如此、正因該兩國利用意大利海港也、法國主張列强不參加多瑙河五國會議之議、意大利曾聲明保留、今日召集四强會議、意大利甚以爲幸、蓋藉此可以避免巴黎對於列强參加多瑙河各邦會議之無謂筆戰也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯四日柏林電柏林一般意見、皆以爲四强會議、祇爲預備性質之會議、不能解决多瑙河之根本問題、蓋有關係各國間之意、尙極紛歧、且四强會議中亦無多瑙河各國之代表參加、故此項問題、若能變易其目前所預定之討論範圍、則日内瓦當可爲根本上之研究並解决之、蓋德國一貫其傳統政策、欲於多瑙河待援之各邦、與列强之間訂定優先稅則之協約、而所謂列强者、德國實居首要地位、此外柏林方面對於倫敦會議中、亦將談及賠欵及協約國債務之消息、甚表懷疑、蓋德國目下關於賠欵問題、似不願有何新談判、若能待至六月舉行、則德國可無復選舉之憂、而形勢將更順利、現德國將重行頒布關於財政經濟之各種嚴厲法令、此種内政措施、適與賠欵會議同時產生、蓋藉此可以使德國所提出無力償還之主張、益增其力量耳、</p>
<h3>前斯拉夫内閣改組</h3>

<p>哈瓦斯四日貝爾格勒電内閣辭職後、頃由前外長瑪林廓維夫重組新閣、於午後五時半宣誓就職、一切閣員悉仍舊貫、惟前總理席夫廓維夫、則將以軍隊總監頭銜、重入現役軍隊服務、</p>

<h3>靑島日貨充斥</h3>
<p>輸入已超瀋變以前額數</p>
<p>奸商並將日貨假充國貨</p>
<p>靑島通訊、日貨在長江以南、旣無銷路、日商遂改變方針、專在華北一帶、極力推銷、天津靑島爲華北唯一通商口岸、兩處遂成爲日貨輸入之總樞、靑島奸商、心死已久、不知亡國之恨、乃定購大批日貨、源源輸入、故日來市面日貨充斥、各大商號之棧房、均貯滿日貨、即白糖一項、連日入口者、已不下數百萬包、其他貨物、可想而知、據調查最近日貨之輸入、已超過九一八以前之額數、最可恨者、奸商政合永復興昌兩家、竟預購日商鐘淵紗廠出品之九龍洋布、蓋印國貨字樣、由郵局分别寄往山西·陜西·兩省銷售、每家每日寄出者、約在兩千包左右、（每三疋裝一包）將日貨改作國貨、蒙蔽國人、其心更不可勝誅、又三月二十四日泰山丸進口、運到日貨一萬六千二百八十一件、二</p>

<h3>調查團由京西上情况（二）</h3>
<p>附錄國聯處理中日糾紛經過</p>
<p>丙·行政院各國代表的人物</p>
<p>在九月七日國聯大會的時候、法義德三國代表、均由其外交部長親自充任、英國因内閣風潮發生、外長不能親自出馬、故由老外交家薛西爾伯爵代表、及到九月十九日行政院開會時、所謂和平健將之法國外長白里安已返巴黎、英外相又未出席、行政院已失其重心、及開會後數日、德國外長寇蒂、又因法國内閣總理及外交部長蒞德聘問、趕回柏林、而義外長格蘭地、覩此情形、亦借故回國、所以行政院頓成無權無勇之機關、此爲其態度軟弱緣因之一、</p>
<h3>丁·出席行政院的各國態度</h3>
<p>（一）英國英·法·德·意·日·向爲國聯中有權有能之國家、而尤以英法爲最、故小國每有不滿國聯爲英法把持的表示、國聯會員雖有五十四國、而能制止戰爭者、祗有英法日意德五强、此乃五强之所以爲行政院永久委員的最大原因、而五强之中、力量足以與日本相抗者、祗有英法、以海軍而論、日本海軍祗遜於英、而遠勝於法、英法在遠東都有重要的殖民地、戰爭開始之後、於英法海軍未到以前、日本儘可自由行動、且勞師遠征、實爲兵家所忌、故國聯苟令其會員對日開戰、除中國外、英法首當其衝、此英法對於滿洲問題所以不能不愼重考慮、就英國内部來說、保守黨對於國聯、素稱冷淡、而工黨則爲擁護國聯之最熱烈者、各國都是這樣、當中日糾紛發生的時候、適爲英國工黨失勢之時、亦即英國金磅低折及海軍兵變之際、此實爲日本出兵最好的機會、英國處此空前困難時、正忙於國會的改選、及各黨聯合政府的組織、更何暇與頭等强國的日本啟釁、然亦不願其利用以維持世界和平及發展商業的國聯、因此倒閉、故英國的態度、不得不爲保全國聯地位及敷衍日本體面、使兩方易於下塲、而戰爭不至爆發、·並且英國估量日本必能自動撤兵、所以含糊了之、</p>
<p>（二）法國法國與日本邦交、素稱友好、遠東之安南、亦賴此而獲安寗、故對日本的友誼、爲示國所必要保存者、但法國利用以維持凡爾塞條約的國聯、是她外交上最寳貴的工具、法國對於中日糾紛解决、她的困難與英國同、而所取的態度亦正相似、明白了英法態度的背影、則對於九月三十日决議案之苟且敷衍、便易明白了、</p>
<p>（三）義大利及德國這兩國在國聯同屬一派、他們加入國聯的目的、是在利用國聯以維持一等國家地位、因爲他們在行政院能與英法日並　而坐的原故、但說到他們的實力、則遠非日本的對手、義大利在遠東利益甚少、即對國聯亦不能操縱、故對於中日糾紛所採態度、純爲旁觀、德國爲受人壓迫解除軍備、而經濟又復衰落之國、故與中國有同病相憐之嘆、在遠東商塲、雖居重要地位、然以國力殘弱、遠非日本之敵、故敢怒而不敢言、祇有惟英法之馬首是瞻了、故實際上、義德兩國的態度、爲不願多言、</p>
<p>（四）其餘會員國家此等二三四等國家、其領土之完整、端賴國聯及其他公約之保障、故與我國有唇亡齒寒之感、然因力量微弱、知爲日本所輕視、故在會議席上、差不多噤若寒蟬、此等國家的態度、雖表同情於中國、然究無補於事實、（五）美國美國在太平洋地位極其重要、前已言之、故其態度如何、不可忽視、美日在華利益、常常衝突、這是誰都知道的、因此日本出兵東省、爲美國所深忌、美國政府對於解决滿洲問題、固歡迎與國聯合作、然合作之程度、不能超過一定限度之外、否則將爲人民所反對、致危害政府的本身、觀美政府九月二十四日致國聯之覆函、可知其雖同情於中國及國聯處理此案之方法、然卒以其非國聯會員、致令世界和平之維持、因此而感到困難、</p>
<h3>第二時期（十月八日至十一月五日）</h3>
<p>甲·行政院緊急會議的召集</p>
<p>十月九日、日軍飛機炸錦州、消息傳來、各國政府極爲驚愕、有如大夢初醒、始信日本拒絶撤兵、其理由非因日僑生命財產之不安全、實欲以兵力屈服中國於其鐵蹄之下、施代表因此亦請行政院召集緊急會議、謀以對日、</p>
<p>同日行政院主席、一方面致緊急勸告於中日政府、令即停止軍事行動、及防止事件之擴大、一方面定於十月十三日在日内瓦舉行會議該院主席同時亦以上述情形通知美國、旋得美政府同情的答覆、大意謂美國政府熱烈希望國聯對於中日糾紛、盡其所有力量、求公平的解决、並勿稍餒、美國政府、將以其獨立之外交爲國聯行動之後盾、中日兩國因其爲非單公約及九國條約的簽字國家、所以有遵守該種條約的義務、關於此點、美國當爲充分的留意、於此可見美態度的强硬及與國聯合作的决心、</p>
<h3>乙·行政院的新氣象</h3>
<p>前次開會時、行政院所以無權無能、其中一個原因、是列强代表均非外交負責人員、前面已經說過、國聯秘書廳對於此點、極力運動所謂平和健將之法外長白里安、爲這届行政院會議的主席、在習慣上說、六十五届即前届會議的主席屬於西班牙、而下届即六十六届會議的主席應屬於法國、但是此次會議乃賡續届之會議、以審查中日糾紛、應仍稱爲六十五届、故在理應由西班牙外長繼續主席、但在政治上則處理中日糾紛、當以法外長主席爲宜、故這次白里安主</p>
<p>席、實因國聯秘書廳的運動、西班牙外長的謙讓、及白里安負責以得成功、白里安旣爲主席、那英·義·德·及其他國、亦不能不遺派大員出席奉陪、結果、英意政府由外長出馬、惟德國適因内閣改組、外交部長之職、由内閣總理兼任、又以忙於内之應付、故祗派外交大員代之、於是行政院之氣象、爲之一新、（未完）</p>

<h3>究竟怎樣</h3>
<p>— 濟</p>
<p>當九一八東省事變之初。舉國震驚。「此仇不報。國將不國。」此種呼聲。高衝霄漢。政府也表示「收復失地。」萬不容緩·誰料一同遷延。始終按兵不動。致令三省同胞。陷於水深火熱而莫能自拔。及至一二八滬戰爆發。國人視線。移注淞滬。把「收回東北」四個字·顯然冷淡了許多。唉。這是多麽痛心。</p>
<p>中央政府不是說「滿洲僞國成立之日。即出師討逆之時。」如今僞國足足成立了一個月。政府不遣一兵一卒。不遺一彈一矢。究竟用意何在。小民殊不能知。現在我們旣認爲淞滬與東北爲整個問題。就得有整個對付的辦法。政府的整個對付辦法。究竟怎樣呢。</p>

<p>此次滬北兵燹。厥災之巨。爲從來所未有。予供職之上海影戲公司。亦付諸一炬。公司在嚴家閣路。密邇天通庵車站。兩軍相接。决生死於此。蓋適在火線中也。某晚。月黑風高。敵掩襲而至。彈火横飛·頓有燎原之勢。而攝影塲遂遭池魚之殃。旣而延及儲片之室。片爲松香等質料所成。極易燃燒。於是烈燄熛怒。上衝霄漢。且發一種奇臭。使人窒息。敵大駭而遁。隨横浜汚潦而死者。不計數。我方得槍械甚多。一時乃有神火殲敵之說。實則藝術結晶之影片數百本。付諸大犧牲耳。祝融氏之狡猾。有不可思議者。而居停但氏之居。藏美術畫集千餘册。俱爲刦灰。予之稿件。置諸案左者。亦同歸於盡。一昨赴滬北。憑弔故墟。不勝感喟已。</p>
<h3>老殘游記中的北拳南革</h3>
<p>— 憂時老人</p>
<p>老殘游記這部書。在前淸光緒年間出版。老人幾十年前看過的。年老健忘。腦筋裏祗留了些痕迹。然而這痕迹老人如果一天健在。就也一天下能磨滅。有人問。你老欣賞他的筆墨嗎。我道。筆墨確好。但是我以爲這還不算甚麽希奇。第一使我驚異的。是其中所說北拳南革一段。細節記不淸了。大約因談術數而說到拳革上面去。祇記得有幾句話說。「一拳打着。不過皮面的浮傷。還不打緊。到了那皮革潰爛的時候。却不可救藥了」。老人因之無窮的感慨。北拳早經成爲事實。南革却又不幸而言中。看過這部書的人很多。全書具在。非盡荒唐無稽。老人閱盡滄桑。感懷家國。不覺放言無忌。人海茫茫。同情者有誰呢。（却酬）</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>啤酒並不是現代的酒。三千年前埃及的ｐａｐｙｒｉ中經提及。　　日常所吃的香蕉。誰都知道只有這麽一二種罷了。但是世界各地所產的香蕉。計有四十餘種之多。</p>
<p>德國柏林一個學校。備有眞的人體骨骼。使學生們可以研究坐與行走倘若不合常席。於骨骼上有何等的弊害。</p>
<p>美國現在有許多時髦的跳舞咖啡館。忽將跳舞廢止。而代以一種紙牌游戱。名“ＣｏｎｔｒａｃｔＢｒｉｄｇｅ，”</p>
<p>倫敦的孩子們。正在一天一天的高大起來。據調查所得。在過去的廿五年間。男孩們都比以前加高一英寸半。體重也加增二十四磅。女孩們比以前加高一英寸。體重加增九磅。</p>

<h3>戎馬雙樓記（二六）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第四回婚約逼人來游移自擾宼氛掠地去釁始重開</p>
<p>李問霞怏悵中扔郤了兩金盒子。也慢慢踱到床邊。將他一把拖起。手拉手面對面的同站着。鄭重其詞的又說道。你别要盡怨我忒多心。我這原是没法子呀。你是本知道我的。我天生就一種零丁孤苦的命。如今漂流在外面。所指望的只是你一個人。望之過切。自不容不有這些過慮。老實說。單是過慮尙不算完。我還要切實要求你一件事呢。安玉田吃驚道。你還想怎麽樣。李問霞羞澀了片刻。囁嚅了幾聲。但終于毅然的要求道。没别的。就是你我的婚約。雖承你信誓旦旦。曾秘密地和我說得那般懇摯。可是對外從未曾公布過。終究還差一層手續。不過這并不是我敢于多疑。也不是我忒煞性急，實在是到了現在。我認爲該是宣布的時候了。你想想看。你現在已是孑然一身没有家庭的束縛。我又是早就志在自立。不讓家庭干涉我的婚事。如今把你我的婚約公布。還怕誰來阻撓。這就根本用不着秘密。即使你要拘泥什麽舊禮敎。在孝服中或種種事實上。不能早日成婚。但婚約歸婚約。婚禮歸婚禮。先宣布了婚約。確定你我的關係。婚禮留在日後什麽時候舉行都可以。又何妨不早點宣布呢。我如今再大膽的說一句。像你我這身世同樣凄凉的人。旣結爲夫婦。以愛情爲基礎那就不必等待舉行世俗的婚禮。先且從權的試行同居。求一個互相關顧互相愛護的便利。也没有什麽不可。說到這。伊臉上不禁湧起兩朶鮮豓的紅雲。又因興奮到了極處。就索興不避羞臊。更使出點本能的撒嬌的手法來。連將安玉田的身子搖揻了幾下。又軟語呢喃的懇求着道。玉田。你要諒解我才好。我得着你這樣一個可愛的人。并承你這般愛我。這在我那苦命的過程中。實是一件極不易得之事。我又愛你愛得太厲害了。旣得着了你。你便是我的生命。萬一若把你失去。我的生命就無異于宣告了死刑。因此我認爲關係太大。常被一種患得患失之心。累得我精神上極感不安。又極爲害怕。所以我必須懇求你宣布這個婚約。給與我一個確切顯明的保證。免得我惴惴。神經永感着痛苦。謝謝你。就立刻允許我這請求罷。說時。搖撼得安玉田更加猛烈。并彷彿表示這便是新女性們對愛人的一種新式示威運動。若不能立刻獲得滿足的答復。簡直就要他受那粉身碎骨的懲創。</p>

<p>本廠棉布市狀自開市後、尙呈活動、然人心依然虚弱、所幸各廠出貨均較前减少、加以日軍所駐之區、尙未開工、故貨價得以站定、但九磅十一磅粗市、亦難挽回頽勢、實以北帮需胃呆頓之故、十三磅以上之貨、因各軍添置夾衣、去路尙不寂寞、所以恒豐三新等廠之貨、一致斷檔、細布時届銷令寗波長江二帮頗有成交、就中以大生之孔省、永安之金城、申新之藍紅鷄、去路最暢、細斜紋亦形活動、怡和漂布受西貨下落影響、亦較前爲低云、</p>

<h3>國難會議會員</h3>
<p>— 金</p>
<p>「國難會議開會你去麽？不去，</p>
<p>爲什麽不去？去完全没有意思，」我聽見多國難會會員，有這樣類似的口吻，的確「去是完全没有意思，没有價値，此次政府召集國難會議，原是「一個糖塊」「包黃連，」</p>
<p>糖塊是塞人家的嘴吧，使不再開口，</p>
<p>黃連是塞人家的嘴吧，使不能開口，</p>
<p>國難會議的最大作用，有意想不到的效力其神秘即在於此，本來國家的事，任何國人，皆當負責，所謂「國家興亡，匹夫有責，」現在國難當前，自應大家起來負些責任，想想法子，</p>
<p>昨據洛陽電訊，平津國難會員，以政府不許討論政治問題多不欲與會，平津會員九十餘人中，去者有及二十人，即據本埠消息，在滬七十餘人之國難會員去者亦屬寥寥并且不出席之國難會員熊希齡等，近日發表宣言，謂倘赴會而默然，則非奔走國難之初衷，倘言而不及根本，則政府已優爲之「云云，本來政府之敦請諸君並不要諸君開口，祇要諸君不開口彼此心照就是，請看此次政府所請的國難會員名單，其資格之複雜猶如開設百貨商店一般，光怪陸離，無物不備，但依我約略計之，可分四類，一具賈董才華者，一能舌辯蘇張者，一深通孫武者一薄有虚名者如此則包羅萬象，無美不收，一般反動份子，統統收拾於國難會的乾坤袋中自此國家的事，無論何人，再不會有人來反對了，</p>
<p>名伶初次登台，必定預先大請其客，遍邀當地幾位别相朋友帮帮忙，指敎指敎，其實一方面是請他們「捧塲」一方面就是請他們「不喝倒采」現在政府的國難會議，其用意亦正是如此，</p>
<p>偏有不識抬舉的國難會員，牢不肯　　去，眞正上海人打話「不識相」哩，</p>

<h3>火柴的製法</h3>
<p>— 丁熙</p>
<p>上古的時候，人民取火的方法，就是用兩塊木頭相摩擦，或是以鐵棒鑽入木塊內。中古的時候，是用可以發火的石頭和鋼鐵相擊。但這兩種取火的方法，人民都感覺有十分的困難，因爲在那個時候，人民的知識未開，科學未發達，没有方法來研究一種便利生火的方法啊。</p>
<p>到西曆一六八○年，英國化學家呵苦華慈（Ｗalker）始利用化學的方法，發明火柴。從這時以後，人民取火的方法，才感覺便利；世界各國便創辦製造火柴的工廠，所以現在的人就用火柴來取火了。然火柴的種類甚多，大别之可分爲兩種：</p>
<p>㈠摩擦火柴（ＦrictionMatches）。製法是用機器將白楊木切成木條將木條的一端，先浸在融鎔的石蠟或硫黃內，然後把黃燐（Ｙellowpharphorus）氯酸鉀（Ｐotassiumchlorete）分子式是ＫＣlo3）和膠水的混合物，附在木條的一端上，等到乾後，黃燐便爲膠所保護。若把這火柴放在空氣中，也不容易氧化；若把木條附藥的一端，在砂紙上或粗物質的面上摩擦，則因摩擦所生的熱，便和氯酸鉀接觸黃燐燃燒。又使木條一端上的石蠟或硫黃着火而傳於木條上；發火而燃燒。</p>
<p>這種火柴是黃燐和氯酸鉀製成的，隨便在甚麽物體上摩擦都能發火。雖甚便利，而有失火的危險。兼之黃燐甚毒，若食百分之十五克，便可以致命；若多吸其蒸氣便生骨疽病。製火柴的工人，常生這種病，就是這個原故。現在各國都禁止用這種火柴了。</p>
<p>到一八九八年，曾有人試得一種三硫化四燐）分子式是Ｐ４Ｓ３），不發生骨疽病，所以各國火柴廠都用這種物質代替黃燐。近來市上有一種紅頭火柴，標明無毒的，就是這一種。</p>
<p>㈡安全火柴（ＳafetyMatches）·製法也是把白楊木枝的一端。先浸在融鎔的石蠟內，然後把氯酸鉀和硫黃（Ｓulphur·符號是Ｓ）用膠黏在楊木枝的一端上。　又把赤燐（Ｒebphosphoqrs）三硫化二銻（ＡntimongTrisulphipe）分子式是Ｓb2S3玻璃粉和膠，塗在火柴匣的兩側面</p>
<p>擦時匣面上的赤燐受摩擦熱而發火，由硫黃，三硫化二　等的助力發生燃燒，其火由石蠟傳於木枝上；</p>
<p>這種火柴，近來在城市裏用的很多，因爲不但没有毒性且不受意外的摩擦而發火險。但只能在火柴匣面上擦得着的，除此以外，是不可能的。</p>

<h3>一幕永不忘却的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 世棣</p>
<p>是舊曆的十二月二十七日，那時閘北的戰事已經暴發第五天了吧！住在吳淞的一般老百姓，却依然營趕着他們過年的雜務，一切都很平静，大街小巷裏仍是熙熙攘攘的，</p>
<p>誰知到了中午，突然在那砲台上連續的起了數次猛烈的砲聲門窗振碎了！房屋搖動了！全鎭登時呈顯着恐怖的絶境，各處只見那些大的，小的，肥的，瘦的，喚着的，嚷着的，哭着的，淚着的人們都紛紛紜紜的向那無目的地狂奔而莽撞着，路绝了橋斷了！唉！唉！　　在那西鎭的末梢，除了幾座資本主義所佔有的紗廠，竟是一片一望無際的田野，有一羣落魄商人携老扶小在那裏繞道環溪地前進着，當時四周的空氣，更是緊迫而死色了！那呼呼無情的槍彈從河浜的南邊如驟雨般地向人叢中灑落魔神似的野砲不時的如流星般的抛投，同時翱翔空中的飛機，往復地盤旋，擲彈，向地下，掃射，當那泥土受了它們的蹂躏，都似浪花般的高處四濺，可憐可憐他們慣養於柔鄉的良民，那能驚得這樣凶險的波濤，他們早已失了人們的知覺，祗能發抖喘吁，不幸的，他們的同伴中一個壯年的男子，不知怎樣的已飮一彈，胸前流着鮮紅的血，他自料决没有生望，他都還牽着小孩的衣袖掙扎地還要前進，戰慄地哀嚎，最後，緊緊的跌伏在地上，殁了，</p>
<p>砲聲稀了，槍聲没了，地面上却還飄繞着烟和霧，在烟和霧中消失了一羣人們的影形，</p>
<p>這一幕悲劇，時刻的映在我目前唉這一幕悲劇永不可忘却的呀！</p>

<p>汽車新聞</p>
<h3>從戰事上說到汽車和飛機影</h3>
<p>自一二八迄於今日。倐忽已是兩個月了。在這兩個月的中間。砲火連天。槍聲遍地。把那繁華的都市。摧殘得好像荒塲死市。旅滬的人士。受此浩刦。精神和物質上。誰都感受着極大的應響。而咒詛那戰爭是人類的一種極殘暴的舉動。在這次的戰爭之中。事實已經昭告我們。說是汽車和飛機。是近世戰爭的利器。而中國軍隊。因爲汽車和飛機的缺少。在軍事上也受了不少的虧。</p>
<p>汽車是近世陸地上交通的唯一工具。這是誰都知道的。但同時它也是戰爭的唯一利器。陸地的戰爭。士卒的調動。糧食輜重的運輸。全賴於汽車。不但如此。而且衝鋒陷陣的鐵甲車。爬山越嶺的坦克車。以及防守邊疆的機關車。裏面發動的機件。也大半是和汽車相同的。此外救護掩埋等工作。也端賴乎汽車的奔馳。即此已足證汽車在軍事上表露敵對行爲時期的重要了。</p>
<p>但汽車的行駛。須有平坦的道路。要是曲徑小道。汽車不便行駛。便完全失却其軍事上的效用了。所以在軍事發動之初。我們也應審察地勢。是否可以行駛汽車。要是戰地一帶。没有平坦的道路。而不問情由。用各種汽車以運輸殺敵。那結果反而會無所效用。使軍事失策的。</p>
<p>繼汽車而後。人類又有飛機的發明。人類所以要發明汽車和飛機。其目的本在使交通便利。但現在一般軍人。竟把汽車和飛機。當做了戰爭的利器結果。使戰地的附近。在汽車和飛機之下傷亡了無數軍民的生命。那汽車和飛機的罪惡。豈非如深淵相似嗎。是何等的殘酷。所謂萬物有利則有弊。善用之則利人。不善用之則損人呢。</p>
<p>歐西各國。一般的人們。都說未來的大戰。將以空軍爲主。的確不錯。因爲以事實而論。飛機在軍事方面。更較汽車爲重要。偵探敵人。抛擲炸彈。防備敵方空軍。效用是何等的偉大。而種種的戰跡。爲飛機所造成的。也更比汽車來得殘酷。就這次的戰爭結果。國人爲敵方飛機而所遭的苦痛。也是萬分的殘酷。今後抗日軍事工作。我們對於空軍方面。也應充分的早作準備。冀敵機無法再在空中爲所要爲以减除民衆所遭的無妄之災。質諸軍事當局。不知以爲何如。</p>
<h3>三十年來上海車輛消長錄虞</h3>
<p>歷年汽車增加最多</p>
<p>三十年來。上海之人口由數十萬而增至三百餘萬。全市交通組織亦續有改良。單就車輛一次而計。街道中來往如織。藉以代步運輸用者。有數百年來如一日之手推小車。及最新之一九三二年式汽車。其中相去誠不知有若干年代也。綜計全上海所有之一切車輛·包括小車·人力車·電車·汽車等而言。其總數不下七萬輛。此數不可謂不鉅。然以全市三百萬人口計。以此車輛之數目。與歐美大都市之車輛數作比例。則仍覺瞠乎其後耳。譬如以汽車一項而論。全上海之公私汽車。爲數不及一萬輛。假使以三百萬人口推算。須三百人始分攤得汽車一輛。然以美國之紐約·支加哥·或舊金山等大城市相比較。每四人可匀得一輛汽車。相去之遠。不可以道里計算矣。</p>
<p>十六年前。全上海所有之汽車。爲數不過五百三十九輛。而馬車之數則較汽車增加一倍有奇。此外更有轎子二十八乘。不時見於市中。降至今日。馬車已歸淘汰。取而代之者惟汽車而已。茲更就近十五年來滬上車輛之變遷。列表如次。</p>
<p>人力車</p>
<p>一九一五年一三·八一六輛　　一九二○年一五·三七三輛　　一九二五年二○·一二六輛　　一九三○年二○·三八五輛　　馬車</p>
<p>一九一五年一·○五三輛　　一九二○年八一七輛　　一九二五年六○五輛　　一九三○年二七二輛　　汽車</p>
<p>一九一五年五三九輛　　一九二○年一·八九九輛　　一九二五年四·○一○輛　　一九三○年六·八九六輛就上表觀之。足見十五年中滬上之車輛。以人力車及汽車之增加爲最多。人力車之增加。第一個五年中不過二千餘輛第二個五年中一躍而倍之。然自一九二五年來。市政當局所發之車照。公用人力車爲數不及一萬。私用包車之數則較公用者爲多。一九三○年時。其數已達一○·三九○輛。</p>
<p>關於汽車之增加。其比率較人力車爲尤速。試就上表考察之。一九一五年時祇有汽車五百三十九輛。至一九二○年一躍而至一·八九九輛其增加有三倍之奇。第二個五年中增加二千餘輛。平均每年增加五百餘輛。自一九二五年至一九三○年所增尤多。將及三千輛。此種汽車大半爲私人所自置。營業用者其數較少。據一九三一年十月一日調查。上海公共租界中之汽車有一百七十五個牌子。今姑就其最著名分析如下。</p>
<p>牌子　數目</p>
<p>别克　五八○福特　五七七飛霞脫三三三奥司汀三三三司啻倍克三二六馬立使克老萊三一三雪佛蘭三○二</p>
<p>與汽車同時進展者。爲全市通行車輛之道路。一九二五年時。通行汽車之硬面馬路。在公共租界中祇有九十四英里又半。一九三○年增加至一百三十二英里。較之前數所增爲百分之四十。自一九二五年至一九三○年此十五年中。如上海之道路不可以寬放增築。則如許之汽車勢不能暢行無阻。一九三○年中。公共租界工部局曾以百萬銀元之鉅欵。舖造一百三十二英里之馬路。及整理四十四英里未經鋪造路面之道路。至於各馬路間之路燈。用煤氣者四八四處。電燈四、七四三起。其所需之費用亦近二十五萬兩之鉅。（未完）</p>
<h3>不日開幕之舊汽車市場</h3>
<p>本埠福煦路三八七號。將有一舊汽車市塲。不日開幕據主持者HEHetnZerＭｒ·Ｈ·Ｅ·Ｈｅｉｎｚｅｒｌｉｎｇling君稱。該樣子間內將完全陳列舊汽車。關於工程方面。每輛均附保單。如買客買後覺有不滿意處。三日之內。包退還洋。此亦欲購眞正可靠舊汽車者之好消息也。</p>
<h3>汽車引擎之位置　楊先垿</h3>
<p>現在之汽車。其引擎均位於車之前部。然而汽車引擎爲何位於車之前部。此一間題固爲一般人及汽車工程司所急欲發問者。依漢卜其氏報告於美國汽車工程會</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>者。則以現在之汽車將引擎置於前部。其所佔去之地位甚多。而乘客之坐位及行李之放置地僅得其半。故現在之汽車雖皆將引擎置於車之前部。而其適當與否尙屬一大問題。故若不將引擎置於車前部。吾人可得到下列各點之利益。</p>
<p>㈠若將引擎設於車之後部。則計畫車身之工程司比較易於着手設計。</p>
<p>㈡若引擎位於後部時。則各種汽油味。熱氣及吵聲當然均在後面。不致使乘車者</p>
<p>感覺是種之不安。</p>
<p>㈢對於車身之曲線及輪角比較美觀。</p>
<p>㈣可用較堅固之引擎其平衡仍得保持。㈤機力之發動與機力之轉傅比較接近並且加油祗用一單旁卜。</p>
<p>㈥推進軸可不必如現在之長。</p>
<p>㈦車架之材料可用較輕之物質。使車之重最减低。</p>
<p>㈧不但乘客坐位之地方可增加。且可使駕駛者之坐位較接近於路面。駕駛者之視綫不致爲高起之引擎所阻當。</p>
<p>㈨其他之利益如現在車燈及備胎之位置對於外觀均不甚美。如置引擎於後。洗車及擦車亦較便利。</p>
<p>因引擎置於後部有上述若干之利益。反之即引擎置於前部不能得到上述之利益。故現在之汽車工程司均注意於此。將來之汽車引擎定不免置於車之後部。吾人拭目以待之可也。</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary</h3>
<h3>Doubt Regarding Achieving a "True" Constitutional Government through Tutelage</h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, and as the national crisis has become increasingly severe, the voices of the people demanding that the ruling Kuomintang make the government open to the public, giving the people the opportunity to jointly face the national crisis, have been very loud for a time. A few days ago, Mr. Wang Jingwei came to Shanghai and successively published speeches in newspapers on the fourth and fifth, answering many questions about domestic and foreign affairs. In particular, he repeatedly explained the issue of democratic politics and the political system of transitioning from tutelage to constitutionalism. His speech was clearly intended to address the demand for an open government from the government's standpoint, as an informal answer. This is enough to make us pay attention. Now, I would like to raise a few questions about the point of political system in Mr. Wang's speech. I respectfully ask Mr. Wang these questions and offer them for the common discussion of the people of the country. In the late Qing Dynasty, our country once prepared for "constitutionalism." Initially, it was set for nine years, and later changed to six years. The calls did not stop, but the Qing Dynasty had already collapsed. Until the Republic of China, in the era of the Northern Warlords, we once again implemented so-called "constitutionalism," imitating Western Europe to establish the foundation of a pseudo-democracy in China. The painting of a tiger failed, and it also collapsed. This is a past fact that is sufficient to serve as a profound lesson for today's authorities.</p>
<p>Since the Kuomintang took power, it has acted as the guardian of the people, believing that it is impossible to enter constitutionalism without tutelage. Article 4 of its program for political tutelage states: "The five powers of governance, namely, executive, legislative, judicial, examination, and supervisory, are entrusted to the National Government for overall management and execution, in order to lay the foundation for a government elected by the people during the constitutional period." Therefore, major national policies are in the hands of the party government, and even in the hands of a small number of people in the party. We believe that instead of suppressing the people and placing them in a position of unfreedom and inequality, and tutoring them in politics, it is better to let them train themselves, so that they can achieve maturity through creation. The effect of being tutored is far less than that of self-training. This is clearly proven throughout Chinese and foreign history. Taking a step back, since the Kuomintang acts as the guardian of the people, we believe that the guardian itself must be healthy in order to seek the health of the infant. If the guardian is terminally ill, and wants the infant to be healthy, how can it be obtained? Today's authorities act as the guardian of the people. Have they ever reflected on whether their own body is healthy? The Kuomintang has been in power for six years, and the people have been obedient and trained for three years. What is the effect of political tutelage? Even in terms of the five powers that the government itself has under its control, power is protected, let alone examinations. Warlords are tyrannical, and how much supervision has been seen? Legislation is merely empty talk on paper, and the judiciary is getting worse and worse. The administration is a complete mess. Moreover, the basic work of the tutelage period, such as local autonomy, has only been heard of, but not seen in practice. The chaos of politics and the severity of the oppression suffered by the people are no less than those of the Northern Warlord era. If it is said that "the constitutional government before 1923 was constitutionalism in name only," then is today's political tutelage not political tutelage "in name only"? Holding political power in the hands of one party, and even in the hands of a small number of people, deprives the people of any opportunity to ask about politics. This so-called tutelage is merely a disguised form of autocracy. Can such a "nominal" tutelage really achieve a "true" constitutional government?</p>
<p>All of these are practical problems facing us today. We sincerely hope that our government and our people will all take the interests of the country as a premise, and calmly discuss and seek a way out together, instead of merely planning for their own interests and arguing with each other, so that they each tend to extremes.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Conference Today's Subcommittee Meeting</h3>
<p>Observing Both Sides' Situation Suggests It Will Be Difficult to Reach an Agreement</p>
<p>If the Meeting Breaks Down, Japan Will Be Responsible</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference will continue to hold a subcommittee meeting at 3 p.m. today. The formal meeting will be held at 10 a.m. tomorrow. The details of yesterday's various parties are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Central Government Orders Guo to Stay</h3>
<p>Foreign Vice Minister Guo Taiqi feels that his role as chief representative to the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference is difficult both internally and externally, and his attitude is negative. He telegraphed the central government a few days ago to request his resignation. When Prime Minister Wang Jingwei came to Shanghai, he also verbally begged to resign. Mr. Wang verbally persuaded him to stay. The central government formally replied yesterday, instructing Mr. Guo to do his best in this time of urgent diplomacy. Therefore, Mr. Guo's intention to resign has been completely dispelled and he has decided to continue his duties and work hard in negotiations.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Instructs to Insist</h3>
<p>Regarding the details of the ceasefire conference negotiations, our representative, Foreign Vice Minister Guo, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Representative Yan in Geneva daily. The authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also telegraphed Mr. Guo daily for instructions. It is learned that after the two sides reached a deadlock at the meeting the day before yesterday, Mr. Guo immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Yesterday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed Mr. Guo again strictly stating that the period for the withdrawal of Japanese troops must be clearly stipulated. If a breakdown occurs, the responsibility for the breakdown must be borne by the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Telegram Reports Japanese Military Actions</h3>
<p>Foreign Vice Minister Guo Taiqi received a telegram yesterday from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, stating that the Japanese troops on the front line have been very active in military actions recently. The foremost line has also been arranged with very solid defensive works. Japanese sentries occasionally break into our army's defense lines and challenge us. Observing their intentions, they are not only absolutely unprepared for a ceasefire and troop withdrawal, but also intend to launch a major offensive. Please report the situation in detail during the meeting so that the ministers of the Allied countries can understand the sinister intentions of the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consulate Also Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>The Japanese authorities held a meeting at the Japanese Consulate at 10 a.m. yesterday. In addition to the Japanese representatives Ueda, Shigemitsu, Shimada, and Tashiro who attended, the Japanese Commander Shirakawa and Foreign Minister Yoshizawa's representative Matsuoka also participated in the discussion. The meeting adjourned at 12 p.m. It is reported that the Japanese side's opinion on the withdrawal of troops is to refuse to stipulate a date. After the Japanese side considers the situation stable, they will withdraw automatically and plan to actively convene a roundtable conference to resolve political issues. They have also decided to issue a declaration stating the Japanese side's attitude.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Will Not Concede</h3>
<p>Reuters reported from Tokyo on the 5th that the Japanese Ambassador to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, had requested instructions from the Japanese government on the issue of the location and time limit for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Tonight, according to semi-official sources, the government will reply that Japan cannot make any further concessions.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Oppose Humiliating Conditions</h3>
<p>Chaozhou Association Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association sent a telegram to the National Government, reading: Respectfully addressed to Chairman Lin of the Luoyang National Government, Prime Minister Wang, Military Commission Chairman Chiang, Foreign Minister Luo, and Foreign Vice Minister Guo. The points that should be noted in the Sino-Japanese ceasefire conference in Shanghai are, in short, that the spirit of the League of Nations resolution should be followed, and only a certain procedure for the withdrawal of Japanese troops can be agreed upon. There must be no conditions that harm China's territorial integrity and administrative independence. In detail, firstly, if there are Japanese troops within Chinese territory, no negotiations will be opened. Secondly, our country's stationing of troops in its territory must not be subject to any restrictions. Thirdly, the cases of the East Province and Shanghai must not be resolved separately, and without the withdrawal of troops from the East Province, there will be no negotiations in Shanghai. Any violation of the above points is a betrayal of power and humiliation of the country, and our people swear not to recognize it. Even if Japan oppresses us with violence, our country can only adopt legitimate self-defense as the only way. No matter how great the sacrifice, we are willing to accept it. It must be known that the government is a government of the people, not a government of the officials in power. The officials in power are only temporary representatives of the people. If they deliberately violate the will of the people and willingly lose territory and sovereignty, then the officials degrade their qualifications as representatives, and the government is no longer a government of the people. Officials holding the authority should be responsible for the country, and also for themselves. These are sincere words, and we hope you will examine them. The Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association National Salvation Committee bows, branch.</p>
<p>The National Products Factory Association, yesterday telegraphed the National Government saying: The Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference has been held many times, and the Japanese side has no sincerity. In addition to sending a large number of aircraft to demonstrate in the air, they also demanded that our side explain the situation of stationing troops south of the Suzhou River and in Nanshi, Pudong, etc. Their sinister intentions are obvious. We hope that you will order Representative Guo, etc., to follow the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly, and not to hinder China's territorial integrity and administrative independence, and not to accept any conditions that humiliate the country and betray power.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Pays Attention to Shanghai Ceasefire Negotiations</h3>
<p>Special Committee Scheduled to Meet on the 11th of this Month</p>
<p>Reuters reported from Geneva on the 4th that Geneva is closely watching the Shanghai armistice conference. Although the Sino-Japanese dispute has been temporarily put aside as far as the League of Nations is concerned, the League of Nations is paying close attention to the outcome of the Shanghai talks. The special committee of the League of Nations Council dealing with Far Eastern issues is scheduled to meet on April 11 to inspect the situation. The Japanese delegation sent a note to League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond, denying the Chinese representative's claim that the Japanese authorities had tried to seize the customs duties of the East Province or control the appointment of customs officials, saying that this issue is within the scope of the government of Manchuria. The note also refuted rumors of a customs union between Japan and Manchuria.</p>
<h3>Summary of Military News from the Front</h3>
<p>A special dispatch from Kunshan on the 5th reported that a part of the 19th Route Army opened to Changshu on the 5th to garrison. The front has been quiet since the enemy's plainclothes team was annihilated. Enemy cavalry have been drilling in the fields of Huangdu for days, and the spring crops have been almost completely destroyed.</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Suzhou on the 5th reported that a new Japanese warship arrived at Yanglinkou. A part of the enemy landed and stood guard to show off force and occupied civilian houses. They return to the ship at 4 p.m. every day. The enemy has set up artillery and nets on the front line, and the situation is tense. A major war is imminent. Bai, a pregnant woman named Xing Zhu, was injured by a Japanese plane bombing. The fetus was also killed by a bullet. The woman is also in danger. Some troops from the 19th Route Army opened to the vicinity of Changshu to take over defense.</p>
<h3>Illegal Organization in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Traitors Collude with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Has Ordered Arrests</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that traitors organized the Zhabei Political Office. The reporter went to the municipal government to inquire about this matter. According to a person in charge, the municipal government did receive a report the day before yesterday that traitors Hu Lifu, Wang Du, etc., colluded with the Japanese side to organize the so-called North City Local Maintenance Association, posting notices, claiming to be appointed by the Japanese side as the director and deputy director of the political office, and appointing Chang as the director of the police affairs office, Cheng as the director of the vehicle affairs office, Yao as the chief detective, and Li as the director of the public security bureau. It is verified that this kind of illegal behavior will of course not have any effect. The municipal government has ordered the public security bureau to conduct a strict investigation. As for the traitors who have gone mad and act as accomplices, they have abandoned themselves to the people of the country and have been ordered to be arrested.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Members of the National Crisis Conference Will Not Go to Luoyang</h3>
<p>Telegraphed Reasons for Not Attending</p>
<p>The Shanghai members of the National Crisis Conference and others did not want to attend because the government had restricted the scope of discussion beforehand. Ma Liang and 66 others telegraphed the National Government jointly, stating the reasons for not attending and their opinions: The National Government is hereby informed that we were honored to be invited to the National Crisis Conference. We have read the organizational outline, which states that we should gather the will of the entire country and jointly determine a national salvation plan. Although we are responsible, we dare not decline even if it is a dangerous task. We deeply believe that all nations that compete for survival in the world take cooperation as the most important condition. Prosperity and decline, survival and death, all depend on this. The reason why our Chinese nation has been weak and is now on the verge of collapse is that the only problem is that we cannot cooperate. The frequency and intensity of internal strife in the Republic of China for more than 20 years have been seen by everyone. In recent years, a one-party dictatorship has been established, cutting off the majority of the people from political cooperation, resulting in party members fighting internally and the public alienated externally. The whole country is noisy and full of malice. The Japanese took advantage of this and the humiliation of September 18 occurred. If this does not change, subjugation can be waited for, let alone resisting aggression. We, the people, intend to participate in the National Crisis Conference to open up our beliefs, eliminate the party rule that prevents cooperation, and realize the constitutionalism of national cooperation. We will work hard to solve this national salvation plan to answer the government's invitation and live up to the people's expectations for governance. However, the government suddenly issued regulations restricting the conference's agenda. After sending representatives to Beijing to pay respects and inquire about the true meaning, we received a reply from Prime Minister Wang stating that the scope of the conference's discussions would be limited to resisting aggression, disaster relief, and pacification. After reading this, we were extremely bewildered, believing that if we obeyed the call to attend the meeting and strictly adhered to the restrictions, and did not mention the national salvation plan, then we would be disloyal to the country and insincere to the government. Since the government had already strictly established restrictions, there was no room for this constitutionalism case to be presented at the meeting. After thinking it over and over again, rather than working hard to travel back and forth without helping the difficult situation, it is better to decline the invitation and clarify our intentions. Therefore, we telegraphed the reasons for not attending and hope that you will understand. As for saving the country, the emphasis is on practical work, which does not differ depending on whether you attend the meeting or not. Constitutionalism is a national salvation plan and is the duty of the people. Since we have a clear understanding, we should open it up in order. We hope that all the party and government officials will consider the country's imminent danger, observe the existence of problems, break down prejudices, and cooperate with the people. China is fortunate. We are extremely frightened and urgent.

<h3>Shangguan Yunxiang Telegraphed to Inform About the Staggered Repayment of Military Rice Borrowed</h3>
<p>Shangguan Yunxiang telegraphed □□□ Division Headquarters Chief of Staff Li, reading: Wucheng brother, I am informed that the reply telegram has been respectfully received. Our department pays a price for the military rice borrowed from various counties. Because our division still has a check for 37,500 yuan issued by the central government, it can be used to offset the amount. Please move to □□ immediately, and I will send Director Fu to bring the check and deliver it to you in person tonight, so that you can hold it and negotiate with the six-county federation for the staggered repayment to various counties. The rest will be detailed in a letter. I, Shangguan Yunxiang, bow.</p>

<p>The Northern Shanghai Rice Market Begins Operations</p>
<h3>Temporarily Located at the Southern End of Old Rubbish Bridge</h3>
<p>The Northern Shanghai Rice Market has been at a standstill since the January 28th Incident. However, it has been trying its best to maintain the local food supply, but without a centralized location, it has been difficult to spread its efforts. Therefore, on the 29th of last month, it invited colleagues to decide to lease No. 38 Zun Deli, located at the southern end of Old Rubbish Bridge, as a temporary market. The location is suitable for concentrating rice boat berthing. Various facilities between the south bank of the New and Old Rubbish Bridges have been approved by the Municipal Council to dispatch patrols for protection. Before the end of the war, carters will add 30% to the original car prices, which will be cancelled as soon as peace is restored. It is scheduled to start business in this market on April 6th.</p>
<h3>Recent News of Japanese Military Transport</h3>
<p>Warship Arrives in Shanghai: Yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM, a destroyer of the 26th Japanese Navy Fleet arrived from the East. It sailed to Yangshupu and dropped anchor. The ship was loaded with a batch of military supplies needed for the front lines, packed in boxes, which were unloaded at the Huishan Wharf and then transferred to the front lines.</p>
<p>Construction of Bamboo Ladders: The Japanese army has recently been collecting a large number of bamboo heads in Shanghai to rush to build countless bamboo ladders.

<h3>Zhongyuan Weaving Factory Provides Financial Assistance to the Family of Teng</h3>
<p>The late Teng Jiushou, Chief of Staff of the former Wusong Fortress, was from Guizhou and died in Wusong. He left behind a desolate family in Shanghai, unable to make a living. The colleagues of the Zhongyuan Weaving Factory, moved by his loyalty and bravery during his lifetime, specially donated half a month's salary, totaling $62.50, to provide financial assistance to the Teng family to comfort his loyal spirit. The donation was personally delivered by a certain gentleman to No. 11 Huabei Apartment, Malang Road, French Concession. He witnessed Mrs. Teng, Yang Peiyao, holding a two-month-old orphan, in a truly desolate and miserable situation. The company had previously donated various items to the front lines. Now, it has donated this sum and printed warning letters, so that the national crisis can never be forgotten. It is said that there are still many left. If anyone requests them by letter, they will be sent immediately.</p>
<h3>Anhai Anping Theater Remits Funds to Comfort Anti-Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>A letter from the Anhai Anping Theater in Jinjiang, Fujian, reads: "To Commander Jiang, General Cai, Commander Dai, and all the soldiers of the 19th Route Army, c/o Shanghai Shen Bao: The savage Japanese invaded Shanghai, causing grief throughout the country. Your Excellency and your soldiers, with a spirit of great fearlessness, fought desperately and achieved repeated successes, which are admired throughout the world. Although the battlefront has been changed due to strategic considerations, the bloody battle of more than a month has killed the enemy and added infinite glory to the country and the nation. Our theater colleagues, with the same hatred for the enemy and the sincerity of offering food and drink, have recently rented and screened the film 'The Bloody History of the Anti-Japanese War of Your Army' to promote your great achievements and make a small contribution. When it was screened, the audience witnessed it as if they were on the battlefield. Seeing the atrocities of the strong bandits, they sighed and grieved, and wanted to weep. Seeing our army destroy the enemy, they clapped and cheered, like thunder. It has moved the people's patriotic hearts and strengthened the morale of the soldiers in the rear, which is not small. In addition to selling tickets for one day to comfort the troops, we also encouraged the purchase of honorary tickets in this port. With the enthusiastic support and active participation of all sectors, a total of $94 was collected from ticket sales and $792 from honorary tickets, totaling $886. This special remittance is made by the Bank of China in Xiamen to the Guohua Bank for transfer, as a small token of our sincerity. Please accept it and give us a reply. Although the atmosphere of peace is gradually becoming stronger, the Japanese are cunning and often insincere. We still hope that you will continue to work hard and prepare for resistance when necessary to win the final victory. The country is fortunate. We respectfully present this to you and wish you all the best. From Anhai Anping Theater, Jinjiang, Fujian."</p>

<h3>Rescuing the Refugees of Taicang</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiafu and others, family members of refugees in the Liuhang area, sent a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that since the Japanese army landed in Liuhang and penetrated into the interior, 100,000 citizens of Yanglin, Liuhang, Xintang, and Pailou were concentrated in the countryside around Yuewang City, north of the Daliuhang Landing Bridge. Bullets and shrapnel flew, and blood and flesh splattered everywhere. The surviving remnants heard the loud thunder and were all terrified and devastated. In particular, the women, children, and the elderly were all in a state of exhaustion and could not survive another day. It was found that Taicang near the city was held by the national army, while the areas east of the city, such as Fuqiao, Pailou, and Xintang, were frequently visited by the Japanese army. Dozens of light and heavy artillery pieces were set up in various villages. These refugees were caught in the middle of the artillery fire, numbering tens of thousands. The refugees in the Jiading area south of the Daliuhang Landing Bridge have already been rescued and out of danger. However, the refugees caught in the Yuewang area are still in deep water and have not been rescued. It is requested that rescue teams be sent immediately, carrying medicine and dry food, to rush to the area within ten miles around the east of Taicang County to rescue these survivors. The Provincial Government immediately telegraphed County Magistrate Zhao of Taicang to consult with the garrison troops to rescue the refugees and transport them to Kunshan, Changshu, and other places for resettlement.</p>
<p>[The Establishment of a Hospital for Distressed Women and Children]</p>
<p>At this time of year when the weather is uncertain, each refugee shelter tends to be easily affected by illness due to the large number of people and poor air quality. However, the hospital equipment is often inadequate. The Catholic Christian Friends Association has specially established a hospital for distressed women and children in Jintang Village, west of Dapu Bridge, to treat those who are ill in the war zone. Dr. Shen Bokang and Dr. Yang Yannian will take turns to reside in the hospital for treatment. Nearby refugee shelters can send letters to the hospital for treatment. However, due to equipment limitations, infectious diseases will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Gion Dharma Assembly Shelter</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the Gion Dharma Assembly Shelter for Refugee Women and Children held a standing committee meeting at the Siming Guild Hall. More than 50 people attended. Xu Qianlin was elected as chairman, and Zhu Hanqing was the recorder. The general affairs director, Feng , reported on the shelter's activities over the past month. From March 3rd to the end of March, the shelter accommodated 410 refugees from Nanxiang, 626 from Beixinjing, 316 from Malu, 4 from Jiangwan, 55 from Wusong, 458 from Jiading, 21 from Shaoxing, 14 from Zhabei, 3 from Pudong, and 30 from Suzhou, totaling 1,937. Some were sent back to their hometowns, including 93 from Nanxiang, 453 from Beixinjing, 4 from Malu, 99 from Jiading, 7 from Shaoxing, 8 from Zhabei, and 3 from Suzhou, totaling 667. A temporary hospital was set up in the shelter to prevent and disinfect against the spread of measles and smallpox, with strict and thorough measures. The income and expenditure of donations were sufficient to cover expenses. The duration of the shelter will be determined at the next meeting. Later, the guests gave speeches of encouragement, which are not recorded. The directors considered that Feng Liantang, as the general affairs director, had been diligent and dedicated, with remarkable achievements, and proposed to apply for a reward for him at the end of the shelter to encourage others.</p>
<h3>Another Batch of Jiangxi Refugees Sent Back</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Guild Hall Refugee Shelter has been operating with great success since its opening and has been praised and supported by various charitable organizations in Shanghai. Previously, more than 2,000 people were sent back to Xun, Lao Jiang Tian, and all of them arrived safely in their hometowns. Yesterday, the Municipal Local Maintenance Association provided free tickets and sent refugees on the Jiang'an steamship, a total of 114 men, women, old and young. There are still a few hundred people staying in the shelter, mostly workers. Seeing that the shelter's relief factory has already started trial operations, they all want to wait for the official factory to be established to make a living.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Rejects Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's Request to Delay New Sugar Tax Rates</h3>
<p>New Taxes Are Still Far Lower Than Those of the United States, France, and Japan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce previously forwarded the request from the Sugar Industry Association to the Ministry of Finance, requesting a temporary postponement of the implementation of the new sugar import tax rules. It has now been learned that the Ministry of Finance has replied to the Chamber, stating in the original telegram: "To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Your telegram of the [date] has been received. This case has been presented to the Ministry by the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association. The Ministry believes that although the new sugar tax rates are higher than before, they are still far lower than those of France, the United States, and Japan. The Schenk process is a scientific method to determine the pure sugar content of sugar and levy taxes accordingly. It is more fair and accurate than the previous method of using Dutch standard colors to judge grades with the naked eye. The new tax table is divided into 15 items, which is a manifestation of the scientific nature of the tax rules. However, it is already simpler than the UK's 25 items, Canada's 37 items, and the United States' 25 items. Changing the calculation of taxes by one-tenth of each item is already a simplification. If the original request of the Chamber is followed, only dividing into three categories with minor taxes would inevitably create too large a distance between the tax amounts, which would unfairly burden merchants and cause disputes over orders. The Association does not seem to fully understand the newly revised tax rates. The request for a temporary postponement of the implementation of the graded tax system is difficult to approve," etc. The Ministry of Finance has instructed the Chamber to be informed accordingly. Seal of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Continued Registration of Unemployed Workers in the War Zone</h3>
<p>The Shanghai War Zone Unemployed Workers Relief Association began registering unemployed workers, and yesterday was the second day. The number of workers registering was more crowded than the first day, but the order was very good. It is estimated that more than 1,000 people registered in the western Shanghai area, and more than 600 people registered in the eastern Shanghai area. The registration point on Carter Road is for registering unemployed workers in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places. Most of the unemployed workers in these places have scattered, so few registered. Although the number of registered people yesterday was more than the first day, it also increased by 124 people. It was originally scheduled to register there until tomorrow. Depending on the number of registrations tomorrow, it will be translated again. If it is not necessary, the extension will not be extended. Unemployed workers in Pudong District are scheduled to start registering tomorrow. The registration point is located in the Union of the Rihua Yarn Factory, opposite the former Pudong Grand Theatre on Nidu Street. The chief director of the registration point is transferred from the Carter Road registration point. The registration schedule is stipulated as follows: the 7th and 8th are for registering workers from the Rihua Yarn Factory, Factories 1 and 2. The Association is actively collecting statistics on the workers who have registered in order to find ways to provide relief. On the first day of registration, 355 men and 1,178 women were counted in the western workers. Except for one person who already has a job, 26 people are willing to return to their hometowns, and 1,506 people need to be introduced to work. The Association will try its best to introduce the workers who need to be introduced to the job introduction stock. It is also planned to send a batch of workers who are willing to return to their hometowns first. The reason why there are fewer unemployed workers registered in Shanghai is that, according to Zhao Zengqi, the chief director of the registration point in the district, the Shanghai Fifth Factory has already started work the day before, and the 4th and 5th days are also the registration days for Shanghai Yarn Factory workers according to the district's registration schedule, so there are fewer registrants.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Burned Narcotics Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Team has seized a large number of prohibited narcotics on various ships in the past three months.

<h3>Cyclist Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Na Bei Shu, a cyclist who traveled around the world, arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. He set off from Singapore on July 7 last year, passed through Penang, Bangkok, Saigon, Haiphong, and entered China. He then went north through the North Sea, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, and passed through Changsha and Hankou to Nanjing, and then reached Shanghai after twists and turns. After that, he will start north, planning to visit Tianjin, Ping, Liaoshen, and other places, and then go to Lushun and Korea, and enter Japan. Then, he will cross the east to Canada, fold south into the United States, tour the New World, and then cross the east to Europe, and return to his native India by land. Lin Na is an Indian scholar. This time he came to China and was well received everywhere. Lin Na praised the beauty of Chinese cultural relics and said that foreigners spread the word that China is full of internal strife and that the local Huai River is not peaceful. In fact, the peace in the Chinese mainland is more peaceful than other countries in Asia, which he has never seen in his life. The beauty of the Chinese countryside and the simplicity of the people make him feel that Eastern civilization is far superior to the West.</p>
<p>###盛澤丞被控詐欺取財</p>
<p>Plaintiff is Yu Cheng Company Organized by Chen Diaoyuan and Others</p>
<p>Demanding Judgment for Repayment of Over 144,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Accusing Him of Failing to Deliver Enough Coal According to Contract</p>
<p>Sheng Argued that the Lawsuit Could Not Be Established</p>
<p>Yu Cheng Company, organized by Chen Diaoyuan, the chairman of Anhui Province, and others, signed a mortgage contract with Poluo Coal Mine Company in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic. Yu Cheng would advance a certain amount of money each month, while Poluo would deliver 5,000 tons of coal each month. Now, Yu Cheng Company claims that Poluo has not fulfilled the contract and has sent representative Dong Xin to hire lawyers Yan Dong and Yu to sue Sheng Zecheng, the general manager of Poluo Company, and Sheng Shouchou in the Shanghai First Special District Court for the crime of fraud and obtaining property. They request punishment under Article 363 of the Criminal Law and also file a civil suit demanding a judgment for the repayment of over 144,000 yuan in national currency. The original complaint states that in March of the 17th year of the Republic, the defendants, in the name of Poluo Coal Mine Company, entrusted Sheng Shouchou, their nephew, to discuss advances with Chen Diaoyuan, Gao Jing, and other directors of Yu Cheng Company, using the coal produced by the company as collateral. At the time of signing the contract, Yu Cheng Company, managed by the plaintiffs, paid 50,000 yuan in national currency. Thereafter, 35,000 yuan in national currency would be advanced each month, and the defendants would deliver at least 5,000 tons of coal to Yu Cheng Company each month. After signing the contract, the plaintiffs fulfilled the advance payments according to the contract, but the defendants violated the contract and, since the signing of the contract in the 17th year until the end of January of the 19th year, successively defrauded Yu Cheng Company of a huge sum of 144,328 yuan in national currency. Later, the plaintiffs found out that Poluo Company could only produce over 40,000 tons of coal each month and had to deliver 15,000 tons to Tongchang. The monthly delivery of 5,000 tons stated in the contract was actually a deceptive act. Moreover, the company's original registered capital was 3 million yuan, but the actual amount received was less than 1.2 million yuan. They claimed to be a registered limited company to the outside world, which made their intent to defraud even more obvious. Furthermore, the money received from Yu Cheng Company was not entirely delivered to Poluo Company, but mostly went to the defendants personally. In summary, the defendants have committed a crime under Article 363 of the Criminal Law and request that the court immediately order the defendants to be arrested and severely punished according to the law, and order them to repay 144,328 yuan in national currency to uphold the law and protect their rights. After receiving the court summons, the defendant Sheng Zecheng also hired lawyer Qin Liankui to submit a statement refuting the allegations one by one. The general gist of the statement was that the contract signed was a contract for exclusive sales of coal, the main points of which were that Yu Cheng would pay a deposit of 50,000 yuan and provide 35,000 yuan each month. All the coal produced by Poluo, except for self-use and local sales, would be exclusively sold by Yu Cheng, after deducting the 15,000 tons to be delivered to Tongchang. A trial period of one year, totaling 60,000 tons of coal, was agreed upon, with a price of 8 yuan per ton. All transportation costs and taxes would be borne by Yu Cheng. The price of coal sold locally should be higher than the exclusive sales price to protect Yu Cheng's interests. Since the signing of the contract, a total of 63,987 tons of coal have been delivered to Yu Cheng, for which Yu Cheng should have paid 511,896 yuan. Adding the deposit of 50,000 yuan, Poluo actually received only 555,488.46 yuan from Yu Cheng, resulting in a deficit rather than a profit. Although Poluo should return 43,580.39 yuan to Yu Cheng, Yu Cheng had various other demands, which prevented both parties from settling the accounts. This kind of settlement of debt issues can be resolved by requesting a court judgment if the two parties cannot agree. However, it is factually untenable to use fraud to accuse Poluo. The plaintiffs' claim that the money was obtained by fraud is extremely false. Poluo has long been registered, and its capital is far more than 1.2 million yuan. Moreover, the purpose of the contract was exclusive sales of coal, which has nothing to do with whether or not the company is registered. As for the claim that the money received from Yu Cheng was not entirely delivered to Poluo Company according to the contract, but a portion was kept by the defendant personally, that is utterly absurd. The receipt and payment of money was a matter for the two companies, and the defendant was only appointed as a representative to sign the contract by the directors. How could he possibly embezzle the money? Such deliberate accusations are an inescapable act of false accusation. The plaintiff is only the deputy manager of Yu Cheng. The manager, Gao Jing, is still alive. The plaintiff has no right to file a lawsuit, and the litigation in this case is not procedurally valid. Based on the above, the plaintiff requests that the court reject the lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Shen Shumu of the Special Court summoned both parties for a hearing and ordered a postponement of seven days, pending the dispatch of bailiffs to Poluo Company to retrieve the account books for further interrogation.</p>
<p>Gordon Road Communist Organization Broken Up</p>
<h3>Seized Soviet Government Proclamation</h3>
<p>According to recent reports from the Central Party Headquarters, there was a Communist Party organization operating secretly in a house at No. 701 Gordon Road in the Shanghai Public Concession. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau was specifically instructed to conduct a strict investigation. Director Wen of the Public Security Bureau selected detectives to work with Chinese and foreign detectives from the Gordon Road Patrol Station. They went to the address on the previous day and arrested four people: Gui Chouren, Jin Weiyuan, Xie Mingyuan, Liu Qing, and Chen Xianxi from Sichuan. They seized a large number of anti-government documents, including a Soviet government proclamation, which was one of the most important pieces of evidence. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Judge Zhao Zhengdeng and Clerk Qian Qizhong opened a special investigative court. After the patrol station lawyer, Li Zhishan, described the circumstances of the arrest, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau detectives requested that the suspects be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for investigation. However, the patrol station lawyer stated that the patrol station could not agree to the transfer, so Judge Zhao ordered the defendants to remain in custody temporarily and adjourned the hearing. Yesterday, another female Communist Party member was arrested and is still under interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wang Ziliang Injured by Thugs</h3>
<p>Wang Ziliang, the former adjutant of the Wusong Fortress Headquarters and the 19th Route Army Headquarters, currently resides at No. 3 Junyi Lane, Beile Road, French Concession. At 8:10 p.m. the night before, Wang was returning home from work in his own car, No. 635. When the car arrived at the entrance of the lane, Wang got out and entered the lane. Just as he was pressing the doorbell, a thug lying in ambush in the darkness threw a bomb at Wang. The explosion shook the neighborhood. Wang suffered minor injuries to his left arm, and the thug escaped in the chaos. Although Wang's bodyguards and family members searched everywhere, the thug had vanished. Wang returned home, bandaged his wounds, and reported the incident to the patrol station. The patrol chief immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate and collect the fragments of the bomb. It is said that the bomb was made of a small amount of explosives and had very little power. Wang has lived in Shanghai for many years, holding various military positions, and is known for his kindness and affability. He has no known enemies. The incident is likely due to a misunderstanding by the thugs.</p>
<p>City Ferry Barge Capsizes</p>
<h3>Dozens Fall into Water</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the Shanghai Municipal Ferry's Songhu route has seen increasing numbers of passengers. At 7:00 a.m. on the morning before last, after the first ferry of the day departing from Shanghai arrived at Songhu, a small barge was used to ferry passengers to the shore. However, at that time, there were many passengers, and they all rushed to board the barge. Moreover, the ferry staff did not handle the situation properly, causing the barge to tilt to one side. Passengers lost their footing and fell into the water, about thirty or forty people. Nearby small boats rushed to the scene to rescue the victims and managed to pull them out of the water one after another. However, the exact number of people who fell into the water was unclear. Passengers reported that about two or three people were missing. They were not found despite efforts to search for them. Yesterday morning, a body floated up in the Huangpu River in front of the ferry dock. Because there were no boats to retrieve it, the body was seen drifting towards Zhanghuabang. It is unknown whether the body was one of the passengers who fell into the water and drowned.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Introduction Scam</h3>
<p>Gu Xingen, a local resident of Kangnaot Road in western Shanghai, inherited a considerable amount of property after his father passed away. However, Gu's father left a will stating that all the inheritance should be divided equally between Gu Xingen and his brother. Gu's father's concubine came forward to oppose this, leading to extreme measures being taken by both sides to hire lawyers and prepare for litigation. At that time, Zhu Hailan, a neighbor from Huzhou, claimed to have considerable experience in litigation and familiarity with the legal profession. He offered to introduce a lawyer if needed. Gu was persuaded and agreed to a date and location to discuss the matter. Gu met Zhu as scheduled at the Oriental Hotel and handed over 950 taels of silver and 50 yuan. Zhu later reported that 500 taels had been used to hire lawyer Shen Weiming to handle the case, and that the opposing lawyer was Yuan. Therefore, the remaining 450 taels were used to bribe Yuan to avoid interference. The 50 yuan was given to clerk Zhang. Gu was initially unaware that he had been fooled. Later becoming suspicious, he inquired at Yuan Xilian's law office and learned that he had been completely deceived. He reported the incident to the Zhabei Patrol Station. The patrol chief ordered detectives to arrest Zhu Hailan at Room 22 of the Xingaosheng Hotel on Guangdong Road the day before last. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Shen conducted a preliminary hearing. The plaintiff's lawyer, Lu Qi, explained the case. The defendant repeatedly denied the allegations, claiming that the plaintiff was making false accusations out of spite. Judge Shen ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody pending the summoning of witnesses for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Supplement to He Chengjun's Speech at the Banquet</h3>
<p>(Hankou) In his speech at the banquet for the investigation team, He Chengjun said that Hubei has been affected by floods and the Northeast and Shanghai incidents, and the reception is very simple, but the intention is sincere. The gentlemen have already inspected the war damage in Shanghai, which must be deeply imprinted in their minds. He accepts all resolutions of the League of Nations, and the gentlemen have no doubt about China's sincerity in seeking peace. Hubei is located in the center of the country, and any incident will affect it. How can the people here not be indignant about this incident? The government has been strongly urging the people to trust the government and the League of Nations for the sake of maintaining public order and waiting for a fair resolution. Therefore, the local area has been peaceful for several months, and the Chinese and foreigners have been getting along well. The gentlemen's visit also includes an investigation of the floods. The floods in Hubei are major and unprecedented. The central government has a comprehensive plan, but it has been affected by the incidents. It is difficult to talk about public order to the victims. However, after the restoration of peace, there will be a way to provide disaster relief, which is in line with the humanitarianism of the League of Nations. The gentlemen's inspection will increase their sympathy, and the League of Nations is fair and impartial to its member states. We are only seeking justice in the Sino-Japanese incident, and we firmly believe that the gentlemen's investigation will achieve justice and fulfill our hopes. (Special dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) In his reply at He Chengjun's banquet, Lytton expressed his great sympathy for the floods and was fortunate that preventive measures were taken seriously and no epidemics occurred. He said that the fact that China has handed over the Northeast issue to the League of Nations is a sign of sincere cooperation, and a satisfactory result can only be achieved through Sino-Japanese cooperation. He believes that both governments are now sincere and hopes that the people of both countries will urge their governments to achieve peace as soon as possible. (Special dispatch on the 5th)</p>

<h3>Philippines Permitted to Be Independent After Eight Years</h3>
<p>US House of Representatives Passes with Majority Vote</p>
<p>Stimson Strongly Opposes with Reasons</p>
<p>Hoover Will Veto and Return for Reconsideration</p>
<p>Reuters Washington, 4th: The United States House of Representatives passed today a bill stipulating that the Philippines can be independent within the next eight years. The Farmer-Labor Party was very pleased with the passage of this bill, believing that the duty-free import of agricultural products will be taxed in the future. However, Secretary of State Stimson issued a letter today strongly opposing it, stating that if the United States withdraws its guiding position in the Philippines, economic, political, and social chaos will inevitably occur, and it will eventually be dominated by Japan or other countries. If the United States withdraws from the Philippines, it is tantamount to showing its cowardice and incompetence, and the prestige of the United States in the Far East will inevitably decline, because this move by the United States is almost equivalent to abandoning the area it is responsible for protecting.</p>
<p>National News Washington, 4th: The US House of Representatives passed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act for Philippine independence today by a vote of 306 to 47. The bill stipulates that the Philippines can become independent after an eight-year transition period without going through a national assembly. The bill was voted on and passed today after forty minutes of discussion in the House of Representatives. However, although there are so many supporters in Congress, President Hoover's attitude is expected to veto any bill for Philippine independence during this period. Since the Secretary of the Army inspected the Philippines last year, the President and the Secretary of the Army have both expressed their opinion that the island has not yet made sufficient progress to be granted complete independence. Therefore, it is expected that the real test of this bill will be when it is returned for reconsideration after the President's veto. Currently, those who voted in favor are only out of selfish domestic interests and have failed to consider the overall situation. The general sugar industry especially desires the independence of the island so that it can build high tariff barriers and hope to obtain a chance for recovery. If this bill is vetoed by the President, many Republican congressmen will inevitably be brought together in the future during reconsideration to back the President, and the outcome is indeed difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Reactions from the Tokyo Newspaper to Stimson's Letter</h3>
<p>Reuters Tokyo, 5th: Tonight, all newspapers prominently published US Secretary of State Stimson's letter on the issue of Philippine independence. Political circles seem very surprised that the US House of Representatives passed the Philippine independence bill, as the House of Representatives has never viewed the Philippine independence issue as a realistic proposal in the near future. Stimson fears that Japan may seize the opportunity to dominate the Philippines after its independence. The Japanese said that this kind of panic is unfounded. Many believe that if the United States is willing to grant the Philippines independence, Japan is willing to conclude an agreement to guarantee its independence. The Japanese are deeply surprised that Stimson's letter contains imperialistic overtones, saying that those who read this letter will never believe that it came from the same hand as the recent letter to Senator Borah.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Soviet Administrative Council Exposes the Conspiracy of the Great Powers</h3>
<p>Urges People to Prepare for Resistance</p>
<p>White Russian Exiles Return to Carry Out Activities</p>
<p>Reuters Riga, 5th: Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars Molotov delivered a highly important speech in Moscow today, stating that certain great imperialist powers are currently planning to seize Soviet Russian territory in the Far East. These countries are plotting to build a White Russian buffer state as a foothold for continuing their attacks on Soviet Russia. Soviet Russia must urgently prepare for resistance.</p>
<p>National News Paris, 5th: Political circles here were shocked upon hearing news from Moscow that White Russian exiles are currently preparing to carry out activities in the Far East. According to Russian newspapers, White Russian newspapers in Shanghai have received a telegram from Paris, signed by Professor Qifoloduofu, representing two grand dukes, announcing that the grand dukes will set sail for Shanghai to prepare for the construction of a buffer state in the coastal provinces of Siberia. Accompanying them is General Gaida, a Czech, and many attendants. General Gaida was an important figure when various countries sent troops to Siberia between 1919 and 1920, and then he retired to his home country. This time, he will lead the White Russian troops, and after the new country is established in the future, he will be the Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<h3>Why is Japan Ordering Rolled Iron Wire from Germany?</h3>

Recently, it has suspended some of its operations due to a lack of orders.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Hold Talks All Day</h3>
<p>On the Danube River Issue</p>
<p>Achieve Full Understanding</p>
<p>Tardier Returns to Paris by Boat</p>
<p>Reuters London, 4th: British cabinet members and the French Prime Minister, etc., gathered at No. 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's residence, today to discuss the overall situation in Europe, with a particular focus on the issue of the Danube countries. The matters discussed included economic, financial, and political events. The meeting lasted six hours before adjourning. Participants included British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and Minister of Commerce Runciman. The French side included Prime Minister Tardier and Finance Minister Flandin. The first meeting was held from 10 AM to 1 PM, and then again from 2:30 PM to 5 PM. An official communique was issued tonight stating that both British and French authorities recognize that the issues they are studying can only be resolved through international agreements. For this reason, there must be close and friendly cooperation among the four major countries discussing this issue on Wednesday. As the Four-Power Conference is about to be held, British and French authorities now only feel that exchanging views with each other can facilitate the work of the conference. The British and French governments hope that a common approach can be established quickly, enabling economic understanding among the Danube countries and facilitating the restoration of balance and stability in the Danube region, while respecting the legitimate interests of third parties. In the evening, a Reuters reporter visited Prime Minister MacDonald, who stated that today's negotiations were very smooth. The preliminary exploration has now been completed. There is full understanding among the representatives, and they have all decided to work hard to carry out the agreement plan within the Four-Power Conference. British and French cabinet members are deeply convinced that all parties' interests can be fully included in the agreement. Prime Minister MacDonald hopes that the results of the conference will enable all participating countries to trust each other and work together in a friendly spirit to resolve the various issues that need to be resolved this summer. It is heard that in view of the success of today's meeting, similar meetings may be held in the future to resolve European problems. After the meeting, Tardier remained at the British Prime Minister's residence for a private conversation with MacDonald, and then met with former Foreign Secretary Lord Reading. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Lord Londonderry, and after the banquet, he returned to Paris by boat. It is heard that there were no formal resolutions at today's meeting, and both Britain and France are free to modify their opinions. Officials expressed hope that the Four-Power Conference can establish an agreement in the shortest possible time, as the situation in the Danube countries is very difficult, and one or two of them are in danger of economic collapse, so the remedy cannot be delayed. At today's meeting, the French representative expressed hope for the restoration of the pre-European War alliance.</p>
<p>Reuters Paris, 4th: The Paris Times reported that the scope of the Anglo-French negotiations in London is very broad. In addition to the Danube River issue, the issues of reparations and reducing military armaments are also being discussed. Particular attention is paid to finding ways to establish an agreement between France and Italy on naval disarmament. It is heard that France has proposed to start negotiations on tariff matters before the British Imperial Economic Conference in July.</p>
<p>European Four-Power Conference</p>
<h3>Held Today at the British Foreign Office</h3>
<p>Havas London, 4th: The Foreign Office announced that the first meeting of the Four-Power Conference will be held at the Foreign Office at 2:30 PM on Wednesday. Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and Minister of Commerce Runciman will represent Britain. Finance Minister Flandin and his specialist committee members will represent France. Foreign Deputy Brouckere will represent Germany. Foreign Minister Grandi will represent Italy, and each will be accompanied by specialist committee members. Grandi is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow, and Brouckere will arrive at 8:30 AM on Wednesday. The conference is expected to last until the end of this week.</p>
<p>National News Berlin, 4th: The German representative to the Danube River Conference, led by Foreign Deputy Brouckere, set off from Berlin tonight. He will first go to Karlsruhe to meet with Prime Minister Brüning before departing for London tomorrow evening. It is heard that Brouckere will go directly to Geneva after the London conference to attend the League of Nations Council. Brüning will postpone his trip to Geneva due to the elections, and will likely not be able to go until the 14th. Havas Rome, 4th: Italian Foreign Minister Grandi paid a visit to Prime Minister Mussolini in the morning and set off for London at 2 PM to represent Italy at the Four-Power Conference.</p>
<p>Havas Rome, 4th: What Italy's attitude will be at the Four-Power Conference can be known from Italy's memorandum. The Italian government declared in the memorandum that Italy is concerned about the Danube River issue not only because it is a strong country, but also because it is the successor to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Italy is also the import and export market for the countries in the Danube River basin and holds the seaports needed by the Danube countries. Italy will defend Austria and Hungary, and Italy will assist them in Geneva to satisfy their hopes. Italy does so precisely because these two countries use Italian seaports. Italy once declared reservations about France's proposal that the great powers not participate in the Danube River Five-Power Conference. Italy is very happy that the Four-Power Conference is being convened today, as this can avoid the pointless pen battles in Paris over the participation of the great powers in the Danube countries' conference.</p>
<p>Havas Berlin, 4th: The general opinion in Berlin is that the Four-Power Conference is only a preparatory conference and cannot solve the fundamental problems of the Danube River, as the intentions of the countries involved are still very divergent, and there are no representatives from the Danube River countries participating in the Four-Power Conference. Therefore, if this issue can change its currently scheduled scope of discussion, Geneva can be the location for fundamental research and resolution. Germany has consistently maintained its traditional policy of wanting to conclude preferential tariff agreements between the Danube countries in need of assistance and the great powers, and Germany is actually the foremost among the so-called great powers. In addition, Berlin is very skeptical about the news that the London conference will also discuss reparations and Allied debts. Germany currently does not want any new negotiations on the reparations issue. If it can wait until June, then Germany can be free from the worry of elections, and the situation will be more favorable. Germany will now re-promulgate various strict decrees on financial and economic matters. These domestic measures coincide with the reparations conference, as this can increase the strength of Germany's claim that it is unable to repay.</p>
<h3>Former Slavic Cabinet Reorganized</h3>
<p>National News Belgrade, 4th: The Yugoslav cabinet resigned to the King today. The Southern cabinet was formed last September by the Radical Agrarian Democratic Party, with seven Serbs, four Croats, and two Slovenes, with General Živković as Prime Minister, continuing the dictator government. Subsequently, under the King's guidance, a strong central government was established, and the provinces were allowed local autonomy.</p>
<p>Havas Belgrade, 4th: After the cabinet resigned, it was reorganized by former Foreign Minister Marinković. All cabinet members remained the same, except that former Prime Minister Živković will return to active military service with the title of Inspector General of the Army.</p>
<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>A telegram from Wanxian is addressed to all newspaper offices, stating: "An appointment order was received from the Commander of the General Reserve Army, appointing Wang Lingji as the Commander of the First Route Column of the General Reserve Army, and issuing a seal of office. The text reads, 'Commander of the First Route Column of the General Reserve Army,' etc. It is found that the Japanese pirates are rampant, disregarding world peace and violating international conventions, occupying our Liaoshen and then Shanghai. All who have blood and qi are filled with righteous indignation. The soldiers of our 19th Route Army were loyal in their resistance, and their righteous name was broadcast far and wide. With respect. Recently, the international investigation team came to Shanghai. The Japanese pirates have no sincerity in the peace talks and are still actively preparing for war in secret. Lingji has spent half his life in the military and has experienced many hardships. Now that the country is in distress, how can I stand idly by? Now that the new order has been issued, I dare not fail to exert myself. I took office on April 1st in Wanxian and am now using the official seal. In addition to ordering the various departments to reorganize and await orders, I also hope that the virtuous heroes within the country and the comrades in Sichuan will deeply understand the disaster of national peril and work together to find ways to save it, and give instructions for us to follow, so as to alleviate the national crisis. I am waiting for orders with the utmost urgency." Wang Lingji, Commander of the First Route Column of the General Reserve Army, kowtows.</p>

<h3>Speculation by Various Countries on Japan's Withdrawal from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Stating that it Will Inevitably Lose Control of the South Pacific Islands</p>
<p>Tokyo Jiji Shinpo published a Geneva telegram stating: "Since the rumor of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations arose, it has attracted great attention from political circles in various European countries. It is generally believed that if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, a major issue will arise at the same time, namely, that it will inevitably lose the right to govern the South Pacific Islands entrusted to Japan by the League of Nations in the past. It has recently been learned from the League of Nations Political Department that if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will immediately cancel Japan's mandate over the South Pacific Islands, and the UK or Germany will inherit all rights, or the South Pacific Islands may be sold to the United States. It is also stated that if China does not change its attitude, the League of Nations General Assembly will have no choice but to continue discussing the Manchuria issue."</p>

<p>30,000 to 40,000 Northeastern Heroes Active</p>
<p>After Occupying Balihu, Advance Towards the South Manchuria Railway</p>
<p>A telegram from Dalian states that since occupying Haicheng County on March 17th, the Veteran North Wind troops of the righteous army in western Liaoning have been recruiting heroes in various parts of western Liaoning to form a strong and powerful righteous army. The total number of people is no less than 30,000 to 40,000, including infantry, cavalry, and artillery units, and the equipment is also very adequate. The commanders of the various routes under its command are Daqiangzi, Dadehao, Bianfang, Quanshan, Sandian, Beihai, Haihong, Haile, Laoshiren, and more than ten others. At 4 PM on March 27th, they reoccupied Balihu. The next day (28th), more than 1,000 of its subordinates also occupied Dagao Lifang. They immediately sent more than 80 reconnaissance team members to Haliliuhecheng Xijianzi and other places to investigate the situation of the Japanese army. That afternoon, the team advanced to Dashiqiao Station on the South Manchuria Railway line and captured Wang Jiabao, the head of the local puppet police station, seizing more than a dozen firearms. The Japanese army stationed in Lushun and Dalian has moved towards Haicheng, and a major battle is expected soon. (March 29th)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Overflowing with Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Imports Already Exceed Pre-Mukden Incident Levels</p>
<p>Treacherous Merchants Pass Off Japanese Goods as Domestic Products</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: With no market for Japanese goods south of the Yangtze River, Japanese merchants have changed their strategy, focusing on vigorous promotion in North China. Tianjin and Qingdao are the only trading ports in North China, and these two places have become the main hubs for the import of Japanese goods. Qingdao's treacherous merchants, long devoid of conscience, and ignorant of the pain of national subjugation, are ordering large quantities of Japanese goods, importing them continuously. Consequently, the market is now overflowing with Japanese goods. The warehouses of major firms are filled with Japanese products. For example, the import of white sugar alone has been no less than several million bags in recent days. The situation with other goods can be imagined. According to investigations, the recent import of Japanese goods has exceeded the levels before the September 18th Incident. Most detestable are the treacherous merchants Zheng Heyong and Fuxingchang, who are pre-ordering "Nine Dragons" cloth produced by Kanebo Spinning Mill of Japan, stamping it with the words "Domestic Product," and mailing it to Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces for sale. Each firm sends out approximately two thousand packages daily (each package containing three bolts), passing off Japanese goods as domestic products and deceiving the people. Their actions are utterly unforgivable. Furthermore, on March 24th, the Taishan Maru arrived, carrying 16,281 pieces of Japanese goods. On</p>

<h3>Situation Report from Jingxi Investigation Team (II)</h3>
<p>Appendix: A Review of the League of Nations' Handling of the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>C. The Representatives of Various Countries in the Council</p>
<p>During the League of Nations Assembly on September 7th, France, Italy, and Germany were represented by their foreign ministers. Due to a cabinet crisis in Britain, the Foreign Secretary could not attend personally, so the veteran diplomat Earl of Cecil represented Britain. By the time the Council meeting was held on September 19th, the so-called "peace champion," French Foreign Minister Briand, had returned to Paris, and the British Foreign Secretary was still absent. The Council had lost its center of gravity. A few days after the meeting began, German Foreign Minister Curtius rushed back to Berlin because the French Premier and Foreign Minister visited Germany for consultations. Seeing this situation, Italian Foreign Minister Grandi also used an excuse to return home. Therefore, the Council became a powerless and ineffective body. This is one of the reasons for its weak stance.</p>
<h3>D. The Attitudes of Various Countries Attending the Council</h3>
<p>(1) Britain: Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan have always been the powerful and capable nations in the League of Nations, with Britain and France being the most prominent. Therefore, smaller countries often express dissatisfaction with the League of Nations being controlled by Britain and France. Although the League of Nations has 54 members, only the five major powers – Britain, France, Japan, Italy, and Germany – can prevent war. This is the primary reason why the five powers are permanent members of the Council. Among the five powers, only Britain and France have the strength to resist Japan. In terms of naval power, the Japanese navy is second only to Britain and far superior to France. Britain and France both have important colonies in the Far East. After the start of a war, before the arrival of British and French naval forces, Japan could act freely. Moreover, launching a distant expedition is something generals greatly avoid. Therefore, if the League of Nations were to order its members to wage war against Japan, Britain and France would bear the brunt, in addition to China. This is why Britain and France had to carefully consider the Manchurian issue. Internally, the Conservative Party in Britain has always been indifferent to the League of Nations, while the Labour Party is its most ardent supporter. All countries are like this. When the Sino-Japanese dispute arose, it was precisely when the Labour Party was losing power in Britain, and the British pound was depreciating and there was a naval mutiny. This was the best opportunity for Japan to send troops. Britain, facing such unprecedented difficulties, was busy with parliamentary elections and the formation of a coalition government, and had no time to start a conflict with Japan, a first-class power. However, it was also unwilling to let the League of Nations, which it used to maintain world peace and develop commerce, collapse because of this. Therefore, Britain's attitude had to be to preserve the League of Nations' position and appease Japan, making it easier for both sides to de-escalate and prevent war from breaking out. Furthermore, Britain estimated that Japan would automatically withdraw its troops, so it handled the matter ambiguously.</p>
<p>(2) France: France and Japan have always maintained friendly relations, and France's Indochina relies on this friendship for stability. Therefore, friendship with Japan is necessary for France to maintain. However, the League of Nations, which France uses to uphold the Treaty of Versailles, is its most valuable diplomatic tool. France's difficulties in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute are the same as Britain's, and its attitude is also very similar. Understanding the background of Britain and France's attitudes makes it easier to understand the perfunctory resolution of the September 30th resolution.</p>
<p>(3) Italy and Germany: These two countries belong to the same faction in the League of Nations. Their purpose in joining the League of Nations is to use it to maintain their status as first-class nations, because they can sit alongside Britain, France, and Japan in the Council. However, in terms of actual strength, they are far from being Japan's match. Italy has few interests in the Far East and cannot control the League of Nations. Therefore, its attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute is purely one of observation. Germany is a country that has been oppressed, disarmed, and its economy is declining. Therefore, it sympathizes with China's plight. Although it occupies an important position in the Far Eastern market, its national strength is weak and far from being Japan's enemy. Therefore, it dares to be angry but dares not speak out, and can only follow Britain and France's lead. In reality, Italy and Germany's attitude is to avoid saying too much.</p>
<p>(4) Other Member States: The territorial integrity of these second, third, and fourth-class countries relies on the guarantee of the League of Nations and other conventions. Therefore, they feel a sense of shared fate with China. However, because their power is weak, they know that they are despised by Japan. Therefore, they are almost silent in the meetings. Although the attitude of these countries expresses sympathy for China, it does not help the situation. (5) The United States: The United States occupies a very important position in the Pacific, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, its attitude cannot be ignored. The conflicts between the interests of the United States and Japan in China are well known. Therefore, Japan's dispatch of troops to the Northeast is deeply resented by the United States. The United States government welcomes cooperation with the League of Nations to resolve the Manchurian issue, but the extent of cooperation cannot exceed a certain limit, otherwise it will be opposed by the people and endanger the government itself. From the US government's reply to the League of Nations on September 24th, it can be seen that although it sympathizes with China and the League of Nations' handling of the case, its non-membership in the League of Nations makes it difficult to maintain world peace.</p>
<h3>Second Period (October 8th to November 5th)</h3>
<p>A. Convening of an Emergency Meeting of the Council</p>
<p>On October 9th, Japanese aircraft bombed Jinzhou. When the news spread, the governments of various countries were shocked, as if awakened from a dream. They began to believe that Japan's refusal to withdraw its troops was not due to the insecurity of Japanese residents' lives and property, but to subjugate China under its iron heel by force. Therefore, Representative Shi also requested the Council to convene an emergency meeting to discuss measures against Japan.</p>
<p>On the same day, the Chairman of the Council sent an urgent warning to the Chinese and Japanese governments, ordering them to immediately cease military actions and prevent the expansion of the incident. He also scheduled a meeting to be held in Geneva on October 13th. The Chairman of the Council also notified the United States of the above situation and received a sympathetic response from the US government, stating that the US government earnestly hopes that the League of Nations will exert all its strength to seek a fair resolution to the Sino-Japanese dispute and not be discouraged. The US government will use its independent diplomacy to support the League of Nations' actions. Since both China and Japan are signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty, they have an obligation to abide by these treaties. Regarding this point, the United States will pay full attention. From this, the strength of America's attitude and determination to cooperate with the League of Nations can be seen.</p>
<h3>B. A New Atmosphere in the Council</h3>
<p>One of the reasons why the Council was powerless and ineffective during the previous meeting was that the representatives of the major powers were not diplomatic officials in charge, as mentioned earlier. The League of Nations Secretariat strongly promoted the so-called "peace champion," French Foreign Minister Briand, to chair this Council meeting. According to custom, the chairman of the 65th session, i.e., the previous session, belonged to Spain, and the chairman of the next session, i.e., the 66th session, should belong to France. However, this meeting was a continuation of the previous session to review the Sino-Japanese dispute and should still be called the 65th session. Therefore, in principle, the Spanish Foreign Minister should continue to chair the meeting, but politically, it was appropriate for the French Foreign Minister to chair the meeting when dealing with the Sino-Japanese dispute. Therefore, Briand's chairmanship this time was due to the League of Nations Secretariat's promotion, the Spanish Foreign Minister's humility, and Briand's responsibility to succeed. Since Briand was the chairman, Britain, Italy, Germany, and other countries could not help but send high-ranking officials to attend and accompany him. As a result, the British and Italian governments sent their foreign ministers. However, Germany was undergoing a cabinet reshuffle, and the position of Foreign Minister was concurrently held by the Premier, who was busy dealing with domestic affairs, so he only sent a diplomatic official to represent him. Thus, the atmosphere in the Council was refreshed. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Public Opposes Rent Collection: Nanhui Dispatch: The Jiangsu Provincial Government's order to collect two months' rent is being implemented by the county government through the Public Security Bureau. However, the public has expressed opposition. The head of Chengdong Town, Yu Baoshan, and others have submitted a request through the First District Office to the county government to exempt them from rent collection, but it has not been approved. Subsequently, people from various places have requested exemption from rent collection, and the matter was submitted to the 99th County Administration Meeting for discussion, resolving: (1) to submit it to the Finance Department for review and instructions; (2) to continue collecting rent according to law before receiving approval for exemption. It is also heard that various groups will jointly submit requests to the provincial government and the Executive Yuan for exemption. Furthermore, it is understood that the public is dissatisfied with the second item of the County Administration Meeting's resolution. Xu Xiaolou, an 83-year-old elder, led the petition to the county government to propose reconsideration and postpone rent collection.</p>
<p>Japanese Plane Opens Fire, Wounding Pregnant Woman: Changshu Dispatch: Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, enemy planes have come to Changshu for reconnaissance almost daily. On the 1st of this month, an enemy plane came to the city area at 7:00 am and circled three times before leaving. Around 10:30 am, it flew to Bianrong Village in Baimao Township of this county for reconnaissance, flying very low and opening machine gun fire. At that time, a young woman surnamed Xing was picking vegetables in the courtyard when a bullet flew from the air and hit her abdomen. The woman was six months pregnant and had reached her ninth month. After being shot, she immediately fainted and fell to the ground, unconscious. Her husband, Na Yongbin, and others carried her to the Jishan Hospital in the city. After the doctor used an X-ray to examine her, the bullet could not be found. Her husband then hired a gasoline boat and sent her to the Bo Xi Hospital in Suzhou for treatment.</p>
<p>Famine Spreads in Eastern Countryside: Changshu Dispatch: Due to the disaster of continuous rain last year, the fields in this county suffered crop failure, and farmers are struggling to survive. The Disaster Relief Association distributed winter relief, and spring relief was originally planned for this spring, but it was not held due to the changes in the current situation. As a result, in recent days, famine victims in the eastern countryside are on the verge of starvation, subsisting only on grass and vegetables. Some are even using bean dregs and cottonseed as food, the situation is extremely miserable. Therefore, in recent days, famine victims from Che Township have often gathered two to three thousand people, led by the elderly and children, to beg for food from wealthy households. Some have even taken away belongings. Fortunately, merchants and wealthy households have raised funds to give each person one hundred or two hundred cash for dispersal, but this is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. The county government has issued a notice prohibiting it and has allocated 12,000 yuan to the three disaster areas through the relief sub-committee to establish interest-free lending offices to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Xinji Passenger Ship Robbed by Bandits: Wujiang Dispatch: The Xinji passenger ship from Shengze to Suzhou was robbed by more than 70 bandits on the afternoon of the 2nd, one o'clock, near Jiapu Bridge, nine miles from the city. The bandits ambushed the area and opened fire, ordering the ship to stop. In addition to robbing the firearms of the patrol boat No. 3 of the 2nd platoon of the 14th team of the 3rd district of the provincial public security team attached to the ship, they also abducted six hostages rescued from Hengjing. Afterwards, they ordered the ship to sail towards Guajing Bridge, boarded the company's ship, searched and robbed passengers of silver, clothes, and other items, and abducted more than ten male and female passengers. By the time the city received the news and sent police to pursue them, the bandits had already fled.</p>
<p>Arsonist Arrested: Wuxi Dispatch: In the 5th district of the county (i.e., Tianshang City) and its surrounding areas, incidents of arson and robbery by bandits have been too numerous to count in the past month.

Last night (the 2nd), at 12:00 am, the house of Xu Genlin, a villager in Xiaolishi, was set on fire by bandits, destroying a newly built room and robbing three thousand copper coins and a cotton quilt. Fortunately, the discovery was early, and a bandit named Jia from Donglai Town was captured, who confessed that he and four others had set the fire and then fled. The suspect has been handed over by the 13th branch of the Public Security Bureau to the county Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>What Exactly Is Going On?</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>At the beginning of the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, the whole country was shocked. "If this hatred is not avenged, the nation will cease to be!" Such cries soared to the sky. The government also stated that "recovering lost territory" was a matter of utmost urgency. Who would have thought that it would be delayed and delayed, and troops would remain motionless, causing the people of the three provinces to fall into deep water and be unable to extricate themselves. By the time the January 28th Shanghai War broke out, the attention of the people shifted to Shanghai, and the four words "Recover the Northeast" were obviously cooled down a lot. Alas, how heartbreaking is this!</p>
<p>Didn't the central government say, "The day the Manchukuo puppet state is established is the day we send troops to suppress the rebels"? Now the puppet state has been established for a full month, but the government has not sent a single soldier or a single bullet. What exactly is its intention? The common people cannot understand. Now that we recognize that Shanghai and the Northeast are a whole problem, we must have a whole solution. What exactly is the government's whole solution?</p>
<h3>Gleanings from the Calamity of War</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>The magnitude of the calamity in Shanghai North during this war is unprecedented. The Shanghai Film Company where I work was also reduced to ashes. The company is located on Yanjia Ge Road, close to the Tiantong'an Railway Station. The two armies met and decided life and death here, as it happened to be in the line of fire. One night, the moon was dark and the wind was high, and the enemy launched a surprise attack. Bullets flew horizontally and vertically, and there was an immediate sense of a prairie fire. The photography studio suffered the disaster of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Then it spread to the storage room. The films were made of materials such as rosin, which were extremely flammable. As a result, the flames raged and soared to the sky, emitting a strange odor that suffocated people. The enemy was terrified and fled, and countless people died in the filthy water of Yokohama. Our side obtained many firearms, and for a time there was a saying that the enemy was annihilated by divine fire. In fact, hundreds of films, the crystallization of art, were sacrificed. The cunning of the god of fire is incredible. The residence of our host, Mr. Dan, which housed more than a thousand volumes of art collections, was all reduced to ashes. My manuscripts, placed on the left side of the desk, also perished. Yesterday I went to Shanghai North to pay my respects to the old ruins, and I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<h3>Northern Boxing and Southern Revolution in the Travels of Lao Can</h3>
<p>— Worrying Old Man</p>
<p>The Travels of Lao Can was published during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. The old man read it decades ago. He is old and forgetful, and only some traces remain in his mind. However, if the old man lives for one day, these traces will never be erased. Someone asked, "Do you admire his writing?" I said, "The writing is indeed good, but I think that's not so surprising. The first thing that amazed me was the passage about Northern Boxing and Southern Revolution. The details are not clear. It roughly spoke about boxing and revolution in the context of numerology. I only remember a few words saying, "A punch only causes superficial damage to the skin, which is not a big deal. But when the skin festers, it becomes incurable." The old man felt endless emotion because of this. The Northern Boxing has already become a reality, and the Southern Revolution has unfortunately come true. Many people have read this book, and the whole book is there. It is not entirely absurd. The old man has seen the vicissitudes of life and is concerned about his family and country. He cannot help but speak freely. The sea of people is vast. Who will sympathize with him? (Returned Thanks)</p>

<h3>The Tale of Two Towers Amidst the Battle (26)</h3>
<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Forced into Marriage, Wandering and Disturbed, Enemy Atmosphere Plunders the Land, Conflict Reopens</p>
<p>Li Wenxia, disappointed, threw away the two gold boxes and slowly walked to the bed. She pulled him up and stood face-to-face with him. She said earnestly again, "Don't blame me for being too suspicious. I really can't help it. You know what I'm like. I was born with a lonely life. Now that I'm drifting outside, I'm counting on you alone. I look forward to it too much, so I can't help but have these worries. To be honest, just worrying is not enough. I have something I really need to ask of you." An Yutian was shocked and said, "What else do you want?" Li Wenxia was shy for a moment and hesitated a few times, but finally resolutely asked, "It's nothing else. It's about our marriage agreement. Although I appreciate your solemn vows and the heartfelt words you secretly said to me, it has never been announced to the public. There's still a layer of formality missing. However, this is not because I dare to be suspicious, nor is it because I'm too impatient. It's just that now I think it's time to announce it. Think about it. You are now alone without family constraints. I have long been determined to be independent and not let my family interfere with my marriage. Now that our marriage agreement is announced, who would we be afraid of hindering us? There's no need to keep it secret at all. Even if you want to adhere to some old etiquette, such as being in mourning or other circumstances, we can't get married early, but the marriage agreement is the marriage agreement, and the wedding ceremony is the wedding ceremony. Announce the marriage agreement first and confirm our relationship. The wedding ceremony can be held at any time in the future. So why not announce it sooner? Now I'll say something even bolder. For people like you and me who have equally miserable backgrounds, since we are married and based on love, there is no need to wait to hold a secular wedding ceremony. Let's try living together for convenience, for mutual care and love. There's nothing wrong with that." As she said this, two bright red clouds could not help but rise on her face. And because she was extremely excited, she simply abandoned her shyness and resorted to some instinctive coquettish techniques, shaking An Yutian's body a few times. She also pleaded in a soft voice, "Yutian, you must understand me. I got such a lovely person like you, and you love me so much. This is really a rare thing in my bitter life. And I love you too much. Now that I have you, you are my life. If I were to lose you, my life would be no different from being sentenced to death. Therefore, I think the stakes are too high, and I am often burdened by a feeling of gain and loss, which makes me feel very uneasy spiritually and extremely afraid. So I must implore you to announce this marriage agreement and give me a clear and definite guarantee, so that I don't have to worry and my nerves are always in pain. Thank you. Please allow my request immediately." As she spoke, she shook An Yutian even more violently, as if to show that this was a new type of demonstration movement by new women towards their lovers. If he couldn't get a satisfactory answer immediately, she would simply subject him to the punishment of being crushed to pieces.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Bar Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Hesitating and fluctuating around 700 taels, the gold bar situation was chaotic again yesterday. Like unpredictable winds and rains, it couldn't be suppressed. Fellow traders were confused, so deposits and withdrawals were erratic. Although the silver market reported a drop, the opening price initially rose, probably due to the ceasefire and troop withdrawal talks. The outcome was uncertain, leading to unease. From morning to noon, it hovered around 700 taels. As the exchange rate was still good, various firms bought to cover their short positions. The market suddenly surged, reaching a peak of almost 710 taels, because the foreign exchange market was strong, the US dollar fell to 32 yuan, and it was rumored that a certain bank was repeatedly collecting cash. The buying sentiment on the surface was strong. Unexpectedly, rumors suddenly arose, all due to the instability of the current situation. In an instant, it fell sharply by seven or eight taels, showing signs of weakness, but finally rose slightly. The overall market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning market showed a weak appearance. The opening price for the May contract dropped by two and a half taels to 698.5 taels. Large bars shrank by one-eighth to two-sixteenths. The silver price dropped by three-eighths. Private telegrams also indicated the same, but the exchange rate saw an increase, leading to a low opening. Before long, Zhifeng Yong bought in, adding three taels to 701.5 taels. However, retail investors sold off, returning to 699.5 taels. Only the exchange rate was still good. Banks traded May US dollars at 32 yuan, and July British pounds were settled at 181875. Furthermore, Qian Changxiang, Yifeng, Hengyu, Hengxingyuan, and others competed to purchase, especially with a certain bank taking in cash. Due to Yingfeng Heng selling out, the market price jumped up, reaching 704.5 taels at almost 9:30 AM. Then it decreased by two taels. However, the first order US contract shrank by 125, so it increased to 03.5 taels. At this time, the internal market also rose. April US dollars were only settled at 31.812. The May contract was being bought by the Dalian gang. Afterwards, 9375 could be obtained. And because Yuan Mao Chengda Yong and others sold off, it immediately fell by more than five taels, with fluctuations of one or two taels. Around 10:00 AM, it was 698 taels. Then, Tongfeng Heng's goods came in, and because a certain bank was buying spot goods again, it went up three taels. At a little after 10:30 AM, it was 701.2 taels. After that, the rise and fall were uncertain, with a two-tael swing. The deposits and withdrawals of each firm were different, but the amounts were not large. Until 11:30 AM, it was 99.2 taels. Hengxing came in, but limited to 9.5 taels. Other firms also sold off slightly, so the price returned by a tael or so. At 11:45 AM, it was 700.002 taels. Fuchang and others sold off, and it retreated to 98.7 taels. But the exchange market was normal. Zhongfu bought July US dollars at 3125, and also sold the first order at 8 pence 25. The foreign firm settled in. At noon, it rose another tael to 9.7 taels, and then closed at 99 taels. But the market situation was confusing and unpredictable. The posted price was changed to 762 taels, a reduction of 60 to 63 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon saw a sharp rise and fall. The market opened at 99.5 taels, then from 9.7 to 8.5 taels. Trading was brisk. Afterwards, the exchange market improved. May US dollars were initially 32.125 yuan, then settled at 0625 to 32 yuan. Zhifeng Yong Dade Cheng came to buy, suddenly adding more than five taels, reaching 704 taels at 2:30 PM. In a blink of an eye, it decreased by two taels. After 2:45 PM, the buying sentiment was strong. Zhifeng Yong Hengyu Fuyu Yifeng Yong Daxing Yong Fuchang and others all competed to purchase, and with the US dollar forward at 31.875 yuan and rumors that a certain bank intended to continue buying spot goods, people's hearts were high. The market situation soared, rising sharply by more than seven taels, reaching 709.8 taels at 4:00 PM. Unexpectedly, a sudden storm arose, with rumors spreading throughout the market, leading to a weakening trend, falling sharply by more than seven taels, which was due to the current situation. Various firms such as Fuchang Yuanheng Yuanmao Yongfu Yu and others began to sell off again, while the US dollar loosened. Banks were willing to sell forward contracts at 32 yuan. At a little after 4:20 PM, it was 702 taels, and the market closed at 03 taels at 4:30 PM, an increase of two taels compared to the posted price of the previous day. However, after closing, it was traded again to 700 taels and change. The highest price for the entire market was 709.8 taels, and the lowest was 698 taels, a difference of 11.8 taels. The posted price was a reduction of 60 taels. Internal and external accounts registered 93 taels and 99 taels, with firms at 93 taels, 97 taels, and red bars adding 1.5 taels.</p>
<p>General speculators were sometimes buying and sometimes selling on the surface. Zhifeng Yong, Daxing Yong, Qian Changxiang, Futai Heng, Yifeng Yong, Yuhe, Yifeng, Hengxing, and Tongfeng Heng were all buying. Hongkang Yong, Yuanmao Yong, Shunli, and Yuankangxiang pulled out. Yuantai, Fuyu, Hengyu, and Dadecheng had frequent ins and outs. Chengda Yong and Taifengcheng were all selling. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, and Yifeng Yong bought and then sold. Daxing Yong, Xiexing Yong, Mr. Wu, Shunli, and Hongkang Yong all bought. Dadecheng sold and then re-entered. Yuanmao Yong, Richang, and Shenkang all sold. Hengyu, Fuyu, Yuantai, and Futaiheng sometimes bought and sometimes sold, covered positions, and bought exchange drafts.</p>

The Japanese yen decreased by 0.25. The Singapore dollar increased by 0.75. As for the internal trends of British and American exchange rates within banks, they were complicated and stagnant. If there were slightly more buyers, it would be tight; if there were sellers, it would immediately weaken. The situation was hesitant, but trading was very active. About 100,000 pounds sterling were traded. Chinese merchants bought slightly more, and foreign firms had occasional ins and outs. About 700,000 to 800,000 yuan of US dollars were traded. The Dalian gang bought recent contracts, and most firms were settling forward contracts. American banks also bought slightly. The Jin gang had cover trades. Although British and American exchange rates returned a bit, the Shanghai market was not affected. The result was that the British pound shrank by 1875 compared to the previous day, and the US dollar also shrank by 1875.</p>
<p>The internal spread of the British exchange rate was 125. The swap rate was about 0625.

<h3>British and American Silver Prices Both Shrink</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a telegram from London on the 4th. Both large silver bars saw a decline, with recent contracts shrinking by 125 and forward contracts shrinking by 1875, both at 17 pence 375. China did not sell much. The United States first advanced and then retreated. The market situation was stagnant after closing. We also received a telegram from New York.

<h3>The Falling Trend of Foreign Cents Starts Again</h3>
<p>Uses are clear and abundant... Reserves are very rich.</p>
<p>Yesterday, because there was no use for them, and the reserves were very rich, the selling sentiment in the market was very strong, causing the price of cents to plummet. The early market was 7 mace 09 li 7 hao 5. The noon market was 7 mace 07 li. The result was a drop of 3.5 li compared to the noon market of the previous day. The silver discount in both the early and noon markets was 1 mace 4 fen, a slight drop of 3 fen compared to the previous day. The bank's posted price was 6 fen, with an added 3 mace 56 fen for head cuts and commissions. The amount of drafts made out was 460,000 in the early market and 550,000 in the noon market.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Spot Goods Continue to Lack Activity</h3>
<p>The market situation for cotton yarn spot goods is still weak. There is no sign of any active spirit in any of the firms, because the peace talks have become another rumor, making it even more difficult for people to be optimistic. Furthermore, there is no hope of loosening the money supply for the time being. Transportation is difficult due to obstacles to transportation in all directions. Business has even less hope of activity, so the market situation is very scattered. Various factories have slight accumulations. Fortunately, the sporadic transactions of various gangs have not been interrupted, so the market price can still be maintained. According to some street runners, it is also possible that the Yunnan gang may have a development at one point. The statistics for the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day was 335 bales. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. 50 bales went to Shantou, 65 bales to Guangdong, 15 bales to Jiangxi, 15 bales to the Northern gang, 5 bales to the inland, 120 bales to Yunnan, and 55 bales went among fellow traders. Shenxin continued to buy a huge amount of raw materials.</p>
<h3>Amounting to Nine Thousand Seven Hundred and Fifty Pieces</h3>
<p>The cotton market situation was slightly firmer. Because American cotton rose, the gold price trended higher, and the exchange rate shrank, people's hearts were slightly better. However, despite large-scale purchases, various factories are still lacking. The falling trend of Indian cotton prices is becoming more intense, so some manufacturers are still bearish. However, the Shenxin factory has a healthier volume and buys from time to time. It is said that during the sharp peak in Indian and American cotton prices last year, many settlement prices were closed. So now they are adding this cotton to offset the headliner, so business is more than other companies. As for the sources from various routes, they still feel desolate. Judging from the overall situation of the cotton market, it is still stable. Shenxin factory had a huge transaction of 9,750 pieces. The prices of the current cotton sold are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Mitelin 34.00 Hongzhang bought 200 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory Lower yarn 34.00 Hongzhang bought 100 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory Lingbao yarn 37.00 Shenxin bought 3,000 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory Luoyang yarn 35.15 Shenxin bought 3,000 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory Zhengzhou yarn 35.00 Shenxin bought 2,500 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory American cotton 32.90 Shenxin bought 1,250 pieces of spot goods delivered to the factory</p>
<h3>American Cotton Eighteen Pounds Sound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to buying in New Orleans, short covering, and a lack of sellers, the American cotton market situation was calm and firm. Futures rose by 15 to 18 pounds. Spot goods rose by 15 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 23 points. Spot goods rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 5 points. Indian cotton Bailuoxi fell sharply by 8 rupees due to long position closures. The original telegram is recorded on the left (400 telegram).</p>
<p>American cotton Compared to the previous day Combined Shanghai standards British cotton Compared to the previous day Combined Shanghai standards 5629 rose 2556.60 5452 fell 329.90 7647 1627.30 7451 229.80 1670 1828.0 1453 230.00 1268 41828.80 12.458 230.40 1693 1629.20 1459 230.50 3705 1629.70 Current 4882 32.00 Current 6401 527.00 Egyptian 6805 44.70 Bailuoxi 177.50 fell 8.00 27.00</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Rice Market is Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice situation in South Shanghai did not see activity. There were not many shops on the market in the morning. Buyers had a light attitude. The selling side was difficult to grasp. The trend was downwards. There were still many foreign rice shipments arriving. Foreign firms sold very little. Changshu and Jiangyin rice, early rice, and other goods were looser than the previous market. The actual reserves were still thick, and people's hearts were stable. The sales of foreign pointed rice were not good. The trading of rural gangs was light. Large orders continued to decrease by several points. Du pointed rice with no goods to offer in exchange for yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, only three or four rice boats from various inland gangs arrived in North Shanghai. Trading on this street was very sparse. Northern japonica rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and the price rose by five points. Thin rice and early rice were weak and light. The situation continued to be strong. Biayin two yuan without glory or disgrace. Foreign rice is currently strong and futures are weak.</p>
<h3>Hankou and Chongming Gangs Buy Spot Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market situation saw both the Chongming and Hankou gangs and the local rural gangs buying. The market conditions trended upwards again. Trading was also active. The overall market saw the Hankou gang buy 3,500 bales of Xiaojiao. The Chongming gang bought more than 300 bales. The local and rural gangs bought a total of more than 1,600 bales. The price opened at 9 yuan 53 cents to 9 yuan 70 cents. The price was slightly higher than the previous market by several points. The futures market was very weak. The entire market only had 300 tons of Xiaojiao returning to their hometowns in April, at 4 taels 6 mace 8 fen, which was smaller than the previous market by 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Both Spot and Futures Flour See Improvement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the spot and futures flour markets saw improvement. The real sales of the northern gangs have weakened, but the interest of this street and others in buying is very strong. The May futures standard navy flour was especially welcomed by buyers. The market price was even better than spot flour. Yesterday, it actually opened at 2 taels 06 fen 25. Spot goods initially opened at 2 taels 05 fen, which was half a fen higher than the previous market. In the afternoon, it continued to rise by 5 li, to 2 taels 05 fen half. The market shape was still strong. Manufacturers intend to shout the price up to 2 taels 07 fen half.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market is Consistent and Trends Upwards</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was not much rise or fall in the sugar market's production area telegrams. The market panel of the guild had very little trading, but the market atmosphere was quite beautiful. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white shouted a price increase of 13 taels 20 cents, but receiving hands were very lazy. Later, there was a slight transaction at 13 taels 10 cents. There was a lack of sellers. No. 16 medium white sugar was 12 taels 65 cents, and finely ground white sugar was 13 taels 25 cents. Both were rare in and out. Taikoo sugar had very thin inventories. The market stepped up again. B mark was 16 taels 2</p>
<p>Money, CW mark 16 taels H mark 12 taels, the trend is very beautiful. The firm plate had Huaxin number selling 700 bags of No. 14 raw sand, priced at 11 taels 20 cents. The local Binghua Qingnian Xiangyuan factory sold hundreds of bags, priced at 11 taels 20 cents, which was 20 cents higher than the previous plate, and the need was quite strong. The market atmosphere was extremely beautiful.</p>
<h3>Textile Market Difficult to Present a Good Image</h3>
<p>The market situation for locally produced cotton cloth has been active since the opening, but people's hearts are still weak. Fortunately, the shipments from various factories have decreased compared to the previous ones. In addition, the areas where the Japanese army is stationed have not yet started work, so the price of goods can be stabilized. However, the coarse market of 9 pounds and 11 pounds is also difficult to reverse the downward trend, because the northern demand is stagnant. Goods above 13 pounds, because various armies are adding interlining clothes, the going is not lonely, so the goods of Hengfeng Sanxin and other factories are uniformly out of stock. The sales of fine cloth reaching the Ningbo and Yangtze gangs in the sales season are quite substantial, with Dasheng's Kongsheng, Yongan's Jincheng, and Shenxin's Blue Red Chicken having the smoothest sales. Fine twill is also active. Yihua bleached cloth has also been lower than before due to the influence of the decline in Western goods.</p>
<p>Although the price of the Western textile market has shrunk in recent days, and the cost has increased, it is still not recovering. Yuanfang's Auction House is still suspended. However, customers who want any goods can write them down, and the price is smaller than the last period. The goods arriving in various lines these days are full of items, especially Fuchou is even more visible, so the price is 5 fen lower per yard than last year. The Duke of Jin from Deji opened yesterday at 6 mace 75 fen, Taihe Golden Hall was 50 fen, Xinjihuoyishayixian was 4 mace 75 fen, and Quansha was 3 mace 75 fen, but other brands also sold for about 30 fen. Because there were fewer bleached cloths arriving, there was no excessive decline. Sassoon's Jiuzhi opened yesterday at 12 taels 25 fen, Anli Qiao Jiumei was 10 taels 07 fen half, and Taihe Meiren was 11 taels. Because the foreign umbrella gang searched for spot goods, the Xiashenyuan rain silk was almost exhausted.</p>
<h3>Hardware British White Iron Sells Smoothly</h3>
<p>The transaction of British white iron was previously sluggish due to the slow sales path, and the market was weak. The standard was oversupplied, and it was step by step downstream. In recent days, the export gang has been purchasing, and the embellishment of the local factory is also better, so the number of openings is very optimistic. Seven feet sells for one tael per sheet, six feet eight mace eight fen, thick colored No. 24 sells for ten taels, No. 26 eleven taels, No. 28 twelve taels (the above are British goods). As for American goods, forty-eight sheets of sixty sell for two taels and two halves, thirty-eight sheets for sixteen taels and five, thirty-three sheets for fifteen taels and two halves, and twenty-five sheets for fourteen taels and five. Inquiries into the trading of various goods revealed that British goods were slightly smoother, while American goods were relatively cold.</p>
<h3>Military Hardware Sells Very Well</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, the business of this port has almost stopped, and our hardware industry has also had a declining trend due to the unfavorable environment. Only military hardware has a smooth sales trend due to the authorities' large purchases. Tinplate, cement, steel plate, black iron sheet, white lead sheet, garden lead wire, new lead wire, etc., have all been embellished in large amounts in recent days. The bottom goods were searched for and announced to be shallow, so the standard has skyrocketed, but the investigation found that the source is still small, so the market situation is quite optimistic.</p>

<h3>National Crisis Conference Member</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>"Are you going to the National Crisis Conference? No.</p>
<p>Why not? It's completely meaningless to go." I heard many National Crisis Conference members saying similar things. Indeed, "Going is completely meaningless and worthless." This time, the government convened the National Crisis Conference, which was originally "a candy" "wrapped with Chinese goldthread."</p>
<p>The candy is to shut people up so they won't speak.</p>
<p>The Chinese goldthread is to shut people up so they can't speak.</p>
<p>The greatest function of the National Crisis Conference is an unexpected effect; its mystery lies in this. Originally, the affairs of the country are the responsibility of every citizen. As the saying goes, "The rise and fall of the country are the responsibility of every citizen." Now that the national crisis is at hand, everyone should come forward and take some responsibility and think of ideas.</p>
<p>According to Luoyang telegraph yesterday, the National Crisis Conference members in Pingjin mostly did not want to attend because the government did not allow discussion of political issues. Of the ninety-plus members in Pingjin, only about twenty attended. According to news from this port, only a few of the seventy-odd National Crisis Conference members in Shanghai attended. Furthermore, Xiong Xiling and other National Crisis Conference members who did not attend recently issued a declaration stating that if they went to the meeting and remained silent, it would not be their original intention to work for the national crisis. If they spoke but did not address the fundamental issues, the government would have already done so. Originally, the government's invitation to you gentlemen did not want you to speak, only that you did not speak; both sides knew it. Please see the list of National Crisis Conference members invited by the government this time; their qualifications are as complex as opening a department store, strange and bizarre, with everything available. But according to my rough estimate, it can be divided into four categories: first, those with the talent of wealthy merchants; second, those who can debate like Su and Zhang; third, those who are well-versed in Sun Tzu; and fourth, those with a slight reputation. In this way, everything is included, and nothing good is not collected. The general reactionary elements are all collected in the Qiankun bag of the National Crisis Conference. From then on, no one will oppose the affairs of the country, no matter who it is.</p>
<p>When a famous actor makes his debut, he must invite his guests in advance, widely invite a few close friends in the area to help and give advice. In fact, on the one hand, it is to invite them to "support the show," and on the other hand, it is to invite them to "not boo." The government's National Crisis Conference is intended to do the same.</p>
<p>There are National Crisis Conference members who do not know how to be grateful, who stubbornly refuse to go, truly "don't know what's good for them," as the Shanghainese say.</p>

<h3>Battle of Taicang</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuzun</p>
<p>Japan is attacking with all its forces. The Nineteenth Route Army retreated because they were outnumbered. However, our government did not send elite troops to aid them. So they retreated from Nanxiang to Jiading and from Jiading to Taicang. In recent days, the great battle of Taicang has been very precarious. The people of the country are saddened by this, so I have written this poem. On March 10, they retreated from Nanxiang and then Jiading. Jiading fell, and they retreated to Taicang. No support troops are coming. Who is advocating this? Everyone is shouting to resist. The court's discussions are undecided and empty. Who are the brave soldiers of the Nineteenth Route Army? Their flesh is no different from ordinary people. Even if they can fight for a long time without being tired, how can they withstand bullets and not be wounded? The difference in numbers is so great that the tigers and wolves will eventually drive straight in. The burning, bombing, looting, and plundering are difficult to describe in detail. Wusong and Zhabei have become scorched earth. Six thousand innocent people have been killed. There are two thousand wounded and ten thousand missing. (March 17 report: The Shanghai Social Bureau's investigation of the Shanghai war zone found that over six thousand people died, two thousand were wounded, and ten thousand were missing.) If we talk about property, it is even more difficult to measure. The rough estimate is about sixteen hundred million taels. Among them, cultural institutions have suffered the most. The six universities in Wusong are mostly rubble. The Oriental Library and Commercial Press, with millions of ancient and modern books, including rare editions from the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties and recent works from the East and West, were turned to ashes with a bang. The paper ashes soar in the sky like birds. I don't know when they will be restored. Looking up at the sky and the earth, I sigh deeply. I am happy that our army has won all the battles, and the people's spirit is shaken, and the weak are all strong. Ten thousand people celebrated and had not finished, but were suddenly surprised by the lack of support and a sudden retreat. Ten thousand people cried and stamped their feet and cursed. Who is really planning this badly? Support troops are slow to arrive, and those who come are not elite. Sending this paltry amount to shut people up is making the invaders even more rampant. They have brought disaster to Songhu and Jiading, and now to Kunshan and Taicang. Everywhere they go, they bomb and leave nothing behind. Every family is running away and becoming refugees. The depths of Wuyue Shenzhou will be transformed into a land of nothing. Empty talk about resistance or non-resistance (From the beginning of the Northeast Incident to today, the government has had no preparations for resistance) Its disaster is truly beyond the prehistoric era. The barriers in the southeast and northeast have been removed, and the small court is in Chang'an (Recently, the central government has decided to prepare Chang'an as the secondary capital.) Alas, the small court is in Chang'an for a long time. Jiang and Wang will sing about their achievements for thousands of years (The establishment of the secondary capital means that the southeast will be abandoned, following the northeast, and the party-state leaders will live in peace in the secondary capital. Is this for long-term resistance?) Alas.</p>

<h3>Methods of Making Matches</h3>
<p>— Ding Xi</p>
<p>In ancient times, people took fire by rubbing two pieces of wood together, or by drilling an iron rod into a piece of wood. In medieval times, fire was made by striking flint with steel. However, both of these fire-making methods were very difficult for people, because at that time, people's knowledge was undeveloped, science was underdeveloped, and there was no way to study a convenient method of making fire.</p>
<p>In 1680 AD, the British chemist Walker began to use chemical methods to invent matches. From this time on, people found the method of making fire convenient; countries around the world began to establish factories to manufacture matches, so now people use matches to make fire. However, there are many kinds of matches, which can be roughly divided into two types:</p>
<p>㈠ Friction Matches. The manufacturing method is to use a machine to cut poplar wood into strips. One end of the wood strip is first immersed in molten paraffin or sulfur, and then a mixture of yellow phosphorus (Yellowpharphorus), potassium chlorate (Potassiumchlorete, molecular formula KClo3), and glue is attached to one end of the wood strip. After it dries, the yellow phosphorus is protected by the glue. If the match is placed in the air, it will not easily oxidize; if the end of the wood strip with the medicine is rubbed on sandpaper or a rough surface, the heat generated by the friction will come into contact with the potassium chlorate, and the yellow phosphorus will burn. This ignites the paraffin or sulfur on one end of the wood strip and transfers the fire to the wood strip, causing it to ignite and burn.</p>
<p>This type of match is made of yellow phosphorus and potassium chlorate and can ignite by rubbing against any object. Although very convenient, it carries the risk of fire. In addition, yellow phosphorus is very poisonous, and eating 15% of a gram can be fatal; inhaling too much of its vapor can cause bone necrosis. Workers who make matches often suffer from this disease, which is the reason why. Most countries now prohibit the use of this type of match.</p>
<p>In 1898, someone tested a type of tetraphosphorus trisulfide (molecular formula P4S3), which does not cause bone necrosis, so match factories in various countries use this substance to replace yellow phosphorus. Recently, there is a type of red-tipped match on the market that is labeled as non-toxic, and this is the one.</p>
<p>㈡ Safety Matches. The manufacturing method is also to first immerse one end of the poplar wood branch in molten paraffin, and then use glue to attach potassium chlorate and sulfur (Sulphur, symbol S) to one end of the poplar wood branch. Then, red phosphorus (Rebphosphoqrs), antimony trisulfide (AntimongTrisulphipe, molecular formula Sb2S3), glass powder, and glue are applied to both sides of the matchbox.</p>
<p>When rubbed, the red phosphorus on the surface of the box is ignited by the heat of friction. With the help of sulfur and antimony trisulfide, combustion occurs, and the fire is transferred from the paraffin to the wood branch.</p>
<p>This type of match has been widely used in cities recently, because it is not only non-toxic but also does not ignite due to accidental friction. However, it can only be lit on the surface of the matchbox, and it is impossible otherwise.</p>

<h3>### A Tragedy Never To Be Forgotten</h3>
<p>— Shi Di</p>
<p>It was the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth lunar month. By then, the war in Zhabei had been raging for five days, right? The ordinary people living in Wusong were still busy with their New Year chores, and everything was peaceful. The streets and alleys were still bustling with activity.</p>
<p>Who knew that at noon, a series of intense explosions suddenly erupted from the battery, shattering windows and shaking houses! The entire town was instantly plunged into a terrifying state. Everywhere, people of all sizes, fat and thin, yelling, shouting, crying, and weeping, were running wildly and recklessly in no particular direction. Roads were cut off, bridges were broken! Alas, alas! At the edge of the West Town, apart from a few yarn factories occupied by capitalists, there was an endless expanse of fields. A group of destitute merchants, supporting the old and leading the young, were moving forward along the winding creeks. At that time, the surrounding air was even more tense and deathly! The whistling, merciless bullets rained down from the south bank of the river like a storm, scattering into the crowd. Demonic-like field guns were constantly being thrown like shooting stars. At the same time, airplanes soaring in the sky circled back and forth, dropping bombs and strafing the ground. When the soil was ravaged by them, it splashed high like waves. Alas, alas, those civilians, accustomed to living in comfort, could not withstand such a dangerous storm. They had long lost their sense of awareness and could only tremble and gasp. Unfortunately, a middle-aged man among their companions was somehow struck by a bullet, and crimson blood flowed from his chest. He knew he had no hope of survival, but he was still pulling on his child's sleeve, struggling to move forward, wailing in terror. Finally, he collapsed heavily on the ground and died.</p>
<p>The sound of cannons subsided, and the sound of gunfire disappeared, but smoke and mist still lingered on the ground. In the smoke and mist, the silhouettes of a group of people disappeared.</p>
<p>This tragedy is constantly reflected in my mind! Alas, this tragedy can never be forgotten!</p>

<h3>Newly Built Palace in Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>Because Moscow, the capital of Soviet Russia, wanted to build a great Palace of the Soviets, it offered a reward for design plans. Architects from all over the world competed fiercely to submit their entries. Later, after review and evaluation by the review committee, three winners were selected, including an American from New York named Heck Taylor Hamilton, who won first prize of 12,000 yuan. The other two winners were Russians. Hamilton's work is now on display at an exhibition, and it is highly praised by the general public, because Hamilton used modern, simple straight-line extension methods, concentrating all his energy to create this design. Moreover, he was able to consider the palace's location and the surrounding environment when designing the A-shaped structure, with theaters attached to the left and right ends. The entire building is made of pure white stone. The main entrance of the palace is located in the center of the palace and reaches a height of 150 feet. On both sides of the gate are connected low wings. The larger of the two theaters can accommodate 15,000 people, and the smaller one can accommodate 6,000 people. It also does not install statues of Lenin and laborers like other Soviet Union buildings. It is recently heard that Hamilton will soon go to Moscow to personally guide the construction of the project.</p>

<h3>From Warfare to the Shadow of Cars and Airplanes</h3>
<p>It has been two months since January 28th until today. In these two months, the sound of cannons and gunfire filled the air, devastating the prosperous city and turning it into a desolate wasteland. The people of Shanghai have suffered greatly from this catastrophe, both spiritually and materially, and condemn war as an extremely brutal act of humanity. In this war, the facts have already told us that automobiles and airplanes are the sharp weapons of modern warfare. The Chinese army has suffered many losses in military terms due to the lack of automobiles and airplanes.</p>
<p>The automobile is the only means of transportation on land in modern times. Everyone knows this. But at the same time, it is also the only weapon of war. Land warfare, the movement of soldiers, and the transportation of food and supplies all rely on automobiles. Not only that, but the engines that power the armored vehicles charging into battle, the tanks climbing over mountains, and the machine gun vehicles defending the border are mostly the same as those of automobiles. In addition, rescue and burial work also rely on the speed of automobiles. This alone is enough to prove the importance of automobiles in military operations during periods of hostility.</p>
<p>However, automobiles require flat roads to travel. If the roads are winding and narrow, automobiles cannot travel easily, and they completely lose their military effectiveness. Therefore, at the beginning of a military operation, we should also examine the terrain to see if it is suitable for automobiles to travel. If there are no flat roads in the war zone, and various automobiles are used to transport and kill the enemy regardless of the circumstances, the result will be ineffective and will lead to military mistakes.</p>
<p>Following automobiles, humans invented airplanes. The original purpose of humans inventing automobiles and airplanes was to make transportation more convenient. But now, many soldiers have turned automobiles and airplanes into weapons of war. As a result, countless soldiers and civilians have been killed and injured near the battlefield by automobiles and airplanes. Isn't the sin of automobiles and airplanes like an abyss? How cruel it is! As the saying goes, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Using it well benefits people, but using it poorly harms people.</p>
<p>In Western countries, people generally say that future wars will be dominated by air power. This is indeed true, because in fact, airplanes are more important than automobiles in military terms. Reconnaissance of the enemy, dropping bombs, and defending against enemy air forces are all extremely effective. The various battles that have been created by airplanes are even more cruel than those created by automobiles. As a result of this war, the suffering that the Chinese people have suffered from enemy airplanes is also extremely cruel. In future anti-Japanese military work, we should also make full preparations for air power early on, hoping that enemy planes will no longer be able to do whatever they want in the air, so as to reduce the innocent disasters suffered by the people. I wonder what the military authorities think about this.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Growth and Decline of Vehicles in Shanghai Over the Past Thirty Years</h3>
<p>The Number of Cars Increased the Most Over the Years</p>
<p>Over the past thirty years, the population of Shanghai has increased from hundreds of thousands to over three million. The city's transportation system has also been continuously improved. Just looking at vehicles, there are countless vehicles coming and going on the streets, used for transportation and carrying goods. There are handcarts that have remained the same for hundreds of years, and the latest 1932-style automobiles. The difference between them is truly unknown. In total, there are no fewer than 70,000 vehicles in all of Shanghai, including handcarts, rickshaws, trams, and automobiles. This number cannot be said to be small. However, considering the city's population of three million, and comparing this number of vehicles with the number of vehicles in major European and American cities, it is still far behind. For example, in terms of automobiles alone, there are fewer than 10,000 public and private automobiles in all of Shanghai. If we calculate based on a population of three million, an average of 300 people would have to share one automobile. However, compared with major cities in the United States such as New York, Chicago, or San Francisco, every four people can share one automobile. The distance between them cannot be calculated in terms of miles.</p>
<p>Sixteen years ago, there were only 539 automobiles in all of Shanghai. The number of horse-drawn carriages was more than double the number of automobiles. In addition, there were 28 sedan chairs, which were occasionally seen in the city. Today, horse-drawn carriages have been eliminated, and automobiles have taken their place. Here is a list of the changes in vehicles in Shanghai over the past fifteen years:</p>
<p>Rickshaws</p>
<p>1915: 13,816 vehicles 1920: 15,373 vehicles 1925: 20,126 vehicles 1930: 20,385 vehicles Horse-drawn carriages</p>
<p>1915: 1,053 vehicles 1920: 817 vehicles 1925: 605 vehicles 1930: 272 vehicles Automobiles</p>
<p>1915: 539 vehicles 1920: 1,899 vehicles 1925: 4,010 vehicles 1930: 6,896 vehicles From the table above, it can be seen that the increase in the number of rickshaws and automobiles in Shanghai over the past fifteen years has been the largest. The increase in the number of rickshaws was only over 2,000 in the first five years, but it doubled in the second five years. However, since 1925, the number of public rickshaws licensed by the municipal authorities has been less than 10,000. The number of private chartered rickshaws is more than the number of public rickshaws. In 1930, the number reached 10,390 vehicles.</p>
<p>The increase in the number of automobiles is even faster than that of rickshaws. Examining the table above, there were only 539 automobiles in 1915, but by 1920, it had jumped to 1,899 vehicles, an increase of more than three times. In the second five years, the number increased by over 2,000 vehicles, an average increase of over 500 vehicles per year. The increase was even greater from 1925 to 1930, reaching nearly 3,000 vehicles. Most of these automobiles were purchased by private individuals, and the number of commercial vehicles was smaller. According to a survey on October 1, 1931, there were 175 brands of automobiles in the Shanghai International Settlement. Here is an analysis of the most famous brands:</p>
<p>Brand Number</p>
<p>Buick 580 Ford 577 Flint 333 Austin 333 Studebaker 326 Morris Cowley 313 Chevrolet 302</p>
<p>Progressing at the same time as automobiles are the roads for vehicles to travel on throughout the city. In 1925, there were only 94 and a half miles of paved roads for automobiles to travel on in the International Settlement. In 1930, it increased to 132 miles, an increase of 40% compared to the previous number. In the fifteen years from 1925 to 1930, if the roads in Shanghai could not be widened and expanded, then so many automobiles would not be able to travel smoothly. In 1930, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement spent a huge sum of one million silver dollars to pave 132 miles of roads and repair 44 miles of unpaved roads. As for the street lights along the roads, there were 484 gas lamps and 4,743 electric lamps, and the cost required was nearly 250,000 taels. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Used Car Market To Open Soon</h3>
<p>There will be a used car market at 387 Foch Road in this city, which will open soon. According to Mr. H.E. Heinzerling, the person in charge, the showrooms will be completely filled with used cars. Regarding the engineering aspects, each car will be attached with a warranty. If buyers are not satisfied after buying, they can return the car for a refund within three days. This is also good news for those who want to buy truly reliable used cars.</p>
<h3>The Position of the Automobile Engine Yang Xianxu</h3>
<p>The engines of current automobiles are all located in the front of the car. However, the question of why the automobile engine is located in the front of the car is one that is eagerly asked by the general public and automobile engineers. According to a report by Mr. Hanbok to the American Society of Automotive Engineers, the current position of the engine in the front of the car takes up a lot of space, and the passenger seats and luggage storage space only get half of it. Therefore, although the engines of current automobiles are all located in the front of the car, whether it is appropriate is still a major question. Therefore, if the engine is not placed in the front of the car, we can obtain the following benefits:</p>
<p>㈠ If the engine is placed in the rear of the car, it will be easier for the engineers planning the car body to start designing.</p>
<p>㈡ If the engine is located in the rear, then the various gasoline smells, heat, and noise will naturally be in the back, so that passengers will not feel uneasy.</p>
<p>㈢ The curves and wheel angles of the car body will be more aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>㈣ A stronger engine can be used, and its balance can still be maintained. ㈤ The power of the engine is closer to the power transmission, and only one single pump is used for refueling.</p>
<p>㈥ The drive shaft does not need to be as long as it is now.</p>
<p>㈦ Lighter materials can be used for the car frame, reducing the weight of the car.</p>
<p>㈧ Not only can the passenger seating area be increased, but the driver's seat can also be closer to the road surface, so that the driver's line of sight will not be blocked by the raised engine.</p>
<p>㈨ Other benefits, such as the position of the headlights and spare tires, are not very beautiful in terms of appearance. If the engine is placed in the rear, washing and wiping the car will also be more convenient.</p>
<p>Because placing the engine in the rear has the above-mentioned benefits, the opposite is true if the engine is placed in the front, and the above-mentioned benefits cannot be obtained. Therefore, automobile engineers are now paying attention to this. In the future, the engines of automobiles will inevitably be placed in the rear of the car. We can wait and see.</p>
<h3>Ford Small Car Coming Soon Ze</h3>
<p>The British Ford Motor Company is manufacturing a small car to meet the needs of buyers in Britain and continental Europe. The car name is still Ford. It is a two-door sedan with a four-cylinder engine with eight horsepower. Ford automobiles are world-renowned for their low prices, with annual sales of no less than two million vehicles. Almost all countries in the world have branch factories manufacturing them. The advent of this small car will surely become popular around the world again.</p>
<h3>Features of the New Pontiac Car Fu</h3>
<p>According to Mr. L.E. Zigalnitsky, General Manager of United Motors Company, the manager of Pontiac and Oldsmobile cars, the 1932 automatic shift manufactured by the Oakland division of General Motors Company)</p>
<p>As for the driving management device of various vehicles, its effectiveness is extremely magnificent. The entire chassis is equipped with 47 rubber trays, which are completely insulated from the engine frame, springs, axles, and body. It also eliminates noise and absorbs slight shocks. There are six body styles, and the water tanks are all V-shaped. The seat cushions are extremely exquisite and comfortable. The above picture is a German Ober automobile. The manager of United Motors Company, whose showroom is located at 310 Jing'an Temple Road</p>
<p>The driving seat can be moved forward or backward at will to achieve the greatest degree of comfort. The instrument panel is the latest dial type. The driver can see it at a glance by following the diagram. As for the sun visor installed on the inside, its position can be adjusted at will to protect the driver's eyes. The body is specially crafted to avoid the invasion of hot and cold seasons. As for the circulation of air, either indirectly through ventilators or directly through open screens, everything is extremely appropriate. All of these are features of the new Pontiac car in terms of convenience and comfort. As for the new three-shot tube carburetor and the fuel supply control balancer, the extreme economy and exceptional cost-effectiveness of the six-cylinder and eight-cylinder Pontiac cars are particularly outstanding and unmatched.</p>
