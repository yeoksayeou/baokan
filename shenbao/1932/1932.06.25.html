<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">鴉片果眞將公賣乎　彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>日昨報載行政院汪院長爲鴉片政策發表談話。謂「年來各地之鴉片。未能禁絶成公開之秘密值茲國家財政萬分竭蹶之秋。轉不若實行公開。寓禁於征。一方於實施禁絶。便於統計。一方得一財源。足紓目前之困難。末且言。事在人爲。果辦理得法。亦未始不可實行。徴之各國如英之於印度。美之於斐列賓。其禁止鴉片。亦採寓禁於征之策。其效果初並不如一般人想像之下良」。綜觀汪氏所言。則鴉片實行公賣。雖幸尙如汪氏所表示。「中央以關係重大。迄今猶未决定。」然而細味所謂「倘猶有其他補救辦法决。不願施行此最後政策」之言。則弦外之音。不言共喻。公賣鴉片。殆終將不免於實行。脱然。則吾人不能不抗聲表示堅决之反對。</p>
<p>夫鴉片之毒害我民族。盡人所知清季以來。政府反覆嚴申禁令。反覆表示嚴禁之决心。然而事實上。則種者如故。賣者如故。吸者亦如故。軍人之勒種勒銷包運更如故。勢且日張。此種矛盾之現象。實由政府之不能行其權力。不能下徹底禁絶之决心。故法令若弁髦。政府不能維持其威信。鴉片不能禁絶。而成爲公開之秘密。非禁之罪也。實由於禁而不力也。命令不行。威信不立。咎應誰尸。事至顯然。今政府不切實厲行禁烟之令。反將從而公賣。是殆認爲目前鴉片之流毒尙未普及我全民。而必置我民族於萬刧不復之境耶。</p>
<p>汪氏謂「值茲國家財政萬分竭蹶之秋。鴉片公賣可以得。一財源。紓此困難。」以近利言斯誠爲得計矣。然吾人脱稍一顧念至較遠之數十年後。稍一顧念我民族之前途。則此種開關財源之方法。雖三尺童子。亦皆知其爲飲鳩止渴。亦皆知其足以滅我民族於無形。地皆種烟。農產斷絶。民皆吸烟。淪於鬼域。數十年後。豈僅如林文忠所言。「旣無可籌之。餉亦無可練之。兵」或且更將無可食之粟。無可使之民。目前之困離固紓。將來之慘禍則如何。計小利而忘大害。明近功而忽遠禍。亡國滅種之惡因。自我而種謀國者固應如是耶。</p>
<p>主張鴉片公賣之謬説者。輒多引美之於斐列賓。英之於印度。日之於台灣爲例證。不知彼英日之公賣鴉片。寓禁於征。皆爲對待殖民地之辦法。且美之對斐列賓。非以公賣爲政府闢財源。故行之有效。英對印度則不然。故甘地反英。鴉片政策爲其最重要之點之一。至於日人之於台灣。則更爲以鴉片政策爲毒害台人及我國僑胞之手段。故誘引台人及華僑吸烟。不遺餘力。但脱誘日本軍民吸食。則必處死刑。一九三○年日當局在台重新發給烟民執照。有三日人請給牌照。不僅不許。反强其戒絶。由可知斯數國對殖民地之鴉片政策。皆爲别有用心。吾人誠不解我政府究何所爲而必自儕於殖民地。又何怨於我人民而必倣傚帝國主義者滅絶殖民地民族之辦法。以之對待我人民。而猶曰寓禁於征。其效果並不如一般人所想像之不良。欺人耶。抑自欺耶。</p>
<p>十七年秋蔣介石氏在第一次全國禁烟會議演詞有云。「此後國民政府絶對不從鴉片得一文錢。如有此種嫌疑。我們就認這個是破產的。就不信任他。」言猶在耳也。最近政府重申禁烟之令。行政院且决議嘉獎禁烟最力之山東省韓主席。設使而眞將公賣鴉片。寓禁於征。而從鴉片賺錢。則中外視聽所集。觀瞻所繫。我國家體面。民族人格。究將何存。孟子曰。「羞惡之心。人皆有之。」我政府當局。其竟不一計及此耶。</p>
<p>中山先生之拒毒遺訓有曰。「鴉片營業。絶對不能與人民所賦予之國民政府兩立。苟有主張法律准許鴉片營業。或對鴉片之惡勢力表示降服者。即使爲一時權宜之計。均爲民意之公敵。」又曰。「對鴉片之宣戰。絶對不可妥恊。更不可放棄。負責之政府機關。自身之私便及眼前之利益。倘對鴉片下旗息戰。不問久暫。均屬賣國之行爲。」斯訓斬釘截鐵。具可見中山先生對鴉片之痛恨。及其禁絶鴉片之决心。中山先生逝世。其全部遺敎。容或有可以更改之處。獨此禁烟遺訓。則應絶無可變更之餘地。奈之何舉滿清及北洋軍閥所不敢行。不忍行之鴉片政策。今號稱革命之政府。乃將毅然實行耶。假如中山先生在天有靈。則對此鴉片政策。必將爲我國家我民族而流涙痛哭。假如政府當局而尙未忍背棄中山先生之遺訓。則試一沉思默念。其又果能無動於中耶。吾人深盼政府於無可奈何之中。能覓得其他補救辦法。而萬勿施行此亡國滅種最後之下策。</p>

<p>世界經濟未復常狀</p>
<p>不能要求德國付欵</p>
<p>法德代表昨開直接談判</p>
<p>路透二十三日洛桑電　麥唐納及赫禮歐今日縱談兩小時、衆信此項談話、乃賠欵會議之重要轉機、英財相張伯倫·商務大臣任錫曼·法財長馬丁·同時亦有長時間之討論、嗣後加入英法總揆之談話、下午復繼續討論一時半、談話結果秘而不宣、赫禮歐離塲時、記者詢以談話之目的、但渠不願答覆公報稱、今日之討論、爲「有用及友誼的、」是項討論現决暫停、俾德法兩代表團可交換意見、本星期杪赫禮歐將返巴黎、巴本亦返柏林、當係徴本國政府意見、西門於今日與麥唐納晤談後、即赴倫敦與英内閣磋商、定星期六日返此、</p>
<p>國民社二十三日洛桑電　英法意已在原則上同意胡佛停付計劃、應適用於歐洲各國間債務與賠欵直至全世界回復常狀時爲止、又聞英相麥唐納與法總理赫禮歐今日三小時長談之後、兩人已試行同意於下列四原則、現法國將根據此項原則、自星期五起與德國開始恊商、四原則爲</p>
<p>（一）解决辦法必須切實而永久成爲最後的解决、（二）解决辦法必須含有恢復世界信任心之意、（三）目前或在世界經濟危局恢復時期内、不能要求德國付欵、（四）倘將來重行付欵、必須其性質不致破壞國際商務恊調而後可、</p>
<p>此間觀察時事者認英法已同意第三項、即目前或在世界經濟危局恢復時期内、不能要求德國付欵一節、最爲重要、其意即不啻表示、倘德國願接受俟將來世界經濟復原後重行付欵之原則、則賠欵可長期停付云、</p>

<p>國民社廿四日洛桑電　洛桑會議運命所繫之德法談判、業於今晨十時開始、德總理巴本赴法代表團所居之宮殿旅館、與法總理赫禮歐略事交換意見後、即行暫别、旋於半小時後、復偕外長組拉思·財長克洛靈格·經濟總長汪謨博·德意志銀行總裁路德·赴宮殿旅館、與法代表會議至十二時四十五分而散、以便進餐、法方出席人員除赫禮歐外、有財長馬丁、商務總長杜蘭·及著名財政家祁淑、午後聞定於五時三十分（一説二時）繼續談判、料將討論至赫禮歐回法與巴本回德時爲止、希望届時當可見一試行同意之辦法、俾携歸兩國閣議討論、今日兩國財政顧問俱列席、足見討論事項、經濟重於政治、聞雙方談判顯大有進步、法總理赫禮歐於散會赴餐時曾語外報記者、雙方談話已造成良好空氣與良好語調、據聞今晨會議時、德財長曾譯述德國財政經濟之險狀、歷時甚久、又據德總理之發言人稱、巴本將使法總理明瞭德國不論在目前或日後實在不能再付賠欵之眞相、並重申德國願與法國聯合共謀歐洲經濟之改造、及締結一互相徴詢公約、作爲政治保障云、</p>

<p>國民社二十四日柏林電　自胡佛總統提出大規模軍縮方案後、德國人民與政界之目光、曾一時轉移至日内瓦、今復回至洛桑、今晨十時起德法代表開始直接談判後、洛桑會議已入於决定成敗之時期、英相麥唐納曾向雙方盡力斡旋、但辛勞而無功、因此現認德法直接交換意見、爲打破僵局免致會議失敗之唯一方法、惟今晨德報對於德法談判之前途、已坦然表示悲觀、以爲就今所知、此次直接談判不僅並無共公根據、且雙方意見依然相距甚遠、法人仍力主在長期停付之後、縱數額可以大减、無論如何終須續付、德國則堅持不能再付、此外比國雖有貸鉅欵與德之精密計劃、料係比財政家佛蘭克所擬、但德國輿論復一致拒絶、如德文世界報稱、比國計劃雖可减輕病徴、但無異打一嗎啡針、祇有應急之效、並非眞正救濟辦法、雖於目前時局大有裨益、但將貽悔於日後、故實際不值德代表之一加討論、</p>

<p>國民社二十四日洛桑電　今日出席洛桑會議比代表團聲稱、業將比國所擬歐洲經濟財政善後計劃大綱、作成説帖、送逹主席英相麥唐納、内容分三部份、（一）改組德國公用事業、俾易受以保證德國金融安定爲基礎之種種處置、（二）組織一放欵機關、或即歸巴塞耳國際銀行節制、從事扶助東歐及中歐經濟財政（三）改良歐洲關税制度、俾恢復商務之往來、而以逐漸减輕進口税、爲最後之目標、又比專家此時正與各國代表積極討論流通世界存金恢復信用之計劃、</p>

<p>電通社二十四日東京電　胡佛所提軍備三分之一减縮案、昨夜外務省已接到公電、外務省即與陸海軍省開三省恊議會、種種討論之結果、原則的似到逹下列之見解、（一）軍備應以各該國之特殊事情爲基礎、不能一律縮减三分之一、如果實行、須變更各國現有勢力之比率、而發生國防上之重大問題、日本不能漫然贊成、（二）日本方面不能豫則滿洲問題及與此有關之國際關係之將來、故在現在、不能贊成如斯無分别的軍縮案、（三）提案之動機、在打開世界不况、欲以與縮减軍費相當之額、减付戰債、而謀歐洲經濟界之復活、但日本於戰債問題、毫無關係、</p>
<p>路透社二十三日華盛頓電　美國政界要人中認爲無論在任何環境之下、美國决不參預如法代表彭古在日内討論胡佛總統軍縮計劃時所提出之安全公約、蓋美方認爲胡佛計劃、比諸任何新計劃當予法國以較大之政治的安全、</p>
<p>路透二十四日華盛頓電　國務院聲稱、胡佛總統計畫之成放、多繫於法日兩國、國務院卒已承認該計畫顯然含有歐洲如不能實行軍縮、則其申請取銷與削减戰債美國將置之不理之意、並稱、非歐洲列强减少陸軍、美國不能减少其空軍海軍云、</p>

<p>美報表示未便贊同</p>
<p>路透二十四日倫敦電　財政新聞今日載稱、「滿洲政府」强奪大連關税、顯受日政府之贊助、此舉足以引起間接之後果、殊可令人扼腕、倘各省相率效尤、截留中央政府之税欵、則爲患何堪設想、海關爲中國團結各省重要連鎖之一、無此中國將更見渙散、故地方截留關税之舉動、足使中國財政與經濟在長時期中受重大之危害云、</p>

<p>勝三比二組總分八比七</p>
<p>丨中華陣線有錯誤丨</p>
<p>法商會九比六勝北草地</p>
<p>草地綱球聯賽第一週中華綱球會對臘克斯（俗稱南草地）、於昨日下午在中華綱球場補賽、觀者十分踴躍、中華會因陣線支配錯誤、僅以八比七獲勝一分、論組數則爲三比二、以兩隊之形勢而論、中華至少應以十二比三勝、今枉失四分、</p>
<p>良足可惜、且第一組林寳華鄭兆佳未能以三比零全勝、尙失去一分、更出人意料之外、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>林鄭表演减色　第一組林寳華鄭兆佳對ＡＶ懷愛脱、與哈惠斯、結蛤爲四比六·六比三·六比四、以林鄭上海雙打冠軍之　格、竟致失去一擊、觀其表演、殊爲遜色、鄭兆　　見膽小、林寳　亦少把握、球多自殺、傑作殊少、</p>
<p>余江直落三勝　第二組江道章余田光對孟　與　　、余江全勝三分、比數爲六比一、六比三及八比六、惟二人之配合、亦不　　、余田光尙稱小心、江道章反見柔弱、老將威風、將爲小將蓋照矣、</p>
<p>屠吳不能合作　第三組屠開元　善於雙打、吳祝仁亦稱不弱、惟吳之性穏、屠之性</p>
<p>躁、根本不能合作、開始時二人表演頗佳、時有得意佳作、入後屠時發雷霆、球多不能如意、且煩言時起、球勢每况愈下、對手爲名將惠特與ＡＡ懷愛德、以惠特之資格、而降落第三組、可見其戰略奸滑矣、屠吳二人似難獲勝、如能維持開始時之穏健狀態、未嘗不能取得一分、而結果中華組以四比六及四比六全負、</p>
<p>錢梁尤見減色　錢耀彬與梁德光搭配第四組、星期三梁與郭啟逹聯合時、表演頗佳、昨與錢合、不覺相形見拙、良以梁爲穏健派、而錢爲性急派、加以錢初由香港來滬、尙未得有練習、是以球藝生疏、表演平平、精彩殊少、若以沈美鎭或劉鏗與吳配搭、當不致以直落三敗、是組結果、臘克斯之麥許兒與克梅尼以六比四、七比五及六比三、連獲三分、</p>
<p>馮郭威風不减　各有十年以上資格之馮錫康用郭啟逹、在第五組中、建立奇功、爲昨日五組中表演最佳者、亦爲五組中完畢最早者汗馬戎功、不可多得、以六比一、六比一及八比六擊敗霍華特與阿倫第三盤中、對手曾以五比一局佔優、大有獲勝是盤、取得一分之勢、馮郭二將、鎭靜如常、不以其希望之微而大意、始終小心翼翼、徐圖進展、卒能挽回狂瀾、反敗爲勝、誠非易易矣、</p>
<p>法商勝北草地　星期四法商總會對北草地補第一週賽、結果九對六歸法商勝利、法商實力頗强、而北草地是日大員兵丁、實足充足、故表演頗多精彩、較日前以零比十五全敗於中華會之戰、不同日而語矣、其成績如下、（一）巴倫芝與梅亞斯（法）勝孟賽爾史密士與洛勃遜（北）六比四、六比三、九比六、（二）克倫諾夫與柯爾梅（法、勝納許與柯而巧（北）六比四·六比八·八比六、（三）小塔佛斯與方恩（法）勝福勃斯與哥特根（北十二比十、六比二·四比六、（四）柯爾登與伍萊（北）勝特拉迪士爾與亨特（法六比一·六比四、（五）弗魯特與葛浪脱（法）勝匹布與拉勃脱（北）十比八·六比三·七比九、</p>

<p>「鄉村的孩子們，稍微長大一點，便要守牛割柴雖有爲堂而不能來。那些抱在手中的小寳寳即來也不能收。這些，我們只好把敎育送上門去。惟獨是像巧姑那般大的三五歲的孩子，我們倒不妨把大門開得大大的給他一個「來者不拒」。因爲他們不在家裏·家裏倒少些麻煩，進了學校，學校也不致受很大的累。我承認今天先生是發現了一個新大陸。但是細味先生的口氣，好像城裏的幼稚園是有些不得其所。不知道我猜錯了没有？」朱先生説··「對丨我告訴你一件有趣的故事吧。這故事我是間接聽來的但是千眞萬眞，不是笑話。一位少奶奶死好打牌。她愛打牌過於她那孩子却是一個小天使，十分可愛。但是嬌養慣了難免有時撒嬌。當這少奶奶打牌打得興高彩烈的時候，她的孩子往往要來打攪。他是一刻要吃糖，一刻要吃餛飩，一刻喊抓癢，一刻喊撒尿，鬧得這個少奶奶不得安身。她對孩子説··「你再這様鬧，我就把你送到幼稚園裏去。」小孩子懂得什麽，一天一天的舊做了他媽媽的眼中釘。最後她竟硬着心腸把孩子送進幼稚園去，回到馬將椅上，笑嘻嘻的説··「小東西不在這兒　今天可以痛痛快快的打他幾圈。」鐘兒！城裏幼稚園的先生是做了少奶奶們的老媽子，帮她帶孩子使她無掛無累的賭博。你看敎育的事業是變成這様的無聊。幼稚園下鄉便立刻帮助了農婦生產，豈不是得其所哉！我要補説一句，城裏在紗廠絲廠旁邊辦的幼稚園是一様的有意思。可惜那些小姐式的幼稚敎師好像是甘心情願要做少奶奶們的老媽子而不能自拔。這眞是令人難解。我們這些新大陸上的披榛斬棘的工作，要待誰去做呢？」我説··」當然是我們自己幹！」</p>

<p>吾主張民治是從實際上體騐得來。　吾以爲政治之目的在謀人民的福利。要謀人民的福利，必須人民和土地發生凝固的關係。人民之與土地，是生於斯，聚於斯的；所以政治不外乎生聚兩字。要使人民能生能聚，必須人民能自己保衛自己，並能保衛其土地。</p>
<p>爲什麽人民必須自己來保護自己？因爲自己切膚的痛苦，祇有自己知道得最爲透澈。</p>
<p>爲什麽要人民自己來保衛其土地？因爲土地是人民的土地，惟有自己的東西，才知道愛惜。</p>
<p>爲什麽要本地的人來管本地的事？因爲本地人管本地事，好比管自己切身的事。管自己切身的事，終是小心翼翼，富於責任心；管人家的事！就要隨意不用心了。</p>
<p>吾以爲政治的工具，不外兩事··一日經費，二日人才，皆須取給於人民。政治旣是爲人民的，就應取之於民，用之於民。然而祇取之於民，用之於民還不够，必須人民自己取給，自己利用才是。</p>
<p>總結一句，買了爆竹自己放，個個願意；買了爆竹給别人放，雖五尺童子，也要抱怨。這就是民治的精義。</p>

<p>見馬占山代表。亦竭誠歡迎。該團諸君。悉爲本埠中公·法政·正風文學院·兩江女體師學生。各該校當局。美諸君之義憤救國。留其學級。資以旅費。藉壯行色。與記者談話之張君文忠。曾肄業正風文學院。滬戰爆發。君任某通訊社戰地記者。間亦從事童子軍事業。兩江女體師爲一姚女士·女士係海上聞人姚子讓先生之侄女公子。曾執敎鞭於關外。旅東北時。兩度於役義勇軍。躍馬擎槍。衝鋒陷陣。木蘭·崇嘏。不能專美於前。女士南旋未久。又矢志投筆從戎。亦云壯矣。</p>

<p>喧傳日久之明星公司有聲彩色影片「啼笑因緣」近始攝製完成。前日上午。試映初集於本埠南京大戲院。時正風雨疾作。爲勢至烈。觀衆爭先蒞止。衣履沾濕。不以爲苦。逮經映畢。稱道弗已。</p>
<p>是日鐘鳴十下。樂聲旣作。銀光乍現。劇中要角。由胡蠂女士兼飾沈鳳喜及何麗娜。夏佩珍飾關秀姑。鄭小秋飾樊家樹。蕭英飾關壽峯。演來情景逼眞。描摹入微。而聲容笑貎。舉止神情。竟與書中人靡不酷肖。一時令人陶醉於銀燈光中。旣如重温舊夢。復若晤對故人。蓋張恨水先生原著印象。人人至深。是片表演藝術。並已臻於化境矣。</p>
<p>全片情節。自家樹漫游天橋起。迄鳳喜移居止。所演故事。殊極平淡。完全以表情細膩。情感眞切動人。其間如家樹壽峯萍水相逢。一語傾心。遽成莫逆。壽峯貧病交困。英雄末路。熱涙盈眶。鳳喜聞及家樹囑伊棄業就學之言。恍若置身夢境。不覺喜極而涕。以及私致像片時之盈盈嬌羞。索取照影時之詞意殷殷等處。咸能隨時左右觀衆情感哀樂於不自覺中。此實難能可貴之點。餘若家樹類上。殘脂留痕。鳳喜閨中。幃幕深掩。麗娜一再示意。竭力輸愛諸端。極風光旖旎之致。的是寫情聖手。</p>
<p>劇本分幕緊凑精當。夾叙三方不同之戀愛。廻環曲折。掩映多致。想見獨鶴先生剪裁編製。煞費苦心。而無聲部份之説明。與有聲對白之詞句。字字着力。語語生情。精釆雋妙。得未曾有。有聲發音。至爲清晰。外景於故都勝跡。攝取甚多。大都又爲天然之彩色片。白幔上續續映出。鮮艶悦目。無殊臥游。全劇成續優異。允稱傑搆。聞第二集片。不久亦將開映。度必又有新的貢獻矣。</p>

<p>政府方面新近表示的主張··「共黨如能共赴國難，政府當可放棄剿共政策，移全力以收復失地」。若照現實的情形看來，這的確是很透澈的見解。事實證明··共禍蔓延的主因，是連年天災人禍，只破壞而不事建設，以致民不堪命而迫成滔天大亂；今後倘能修明内政，扶植民生，則政治手段，儘可解决，何勞大軍剿辦？如其移大軍出關，爲義軍後援，不但失地即可收復，而且可以平民氣，振國魂，鞏固國内和平，提高國際地位，當局又何樂而不爲？</p>

<p>— 跚跚</p>
<p>（一）别了西子</p>
<p>東方的天空剛吐露一線魚肚般的白色，我已經同送行人丨那一夜没有安睡的第二期病患者丨一溜烟地踱過了寂寞凄凉的蘇小香塚，步上了幽默而又修長的白堤，走向那杭州繁盛的一角。送行人勸我乘車，我却竭力反對，爲的是我要多瞧一時行將遠離的湖山。這時夜雨雖已停歇，可是和棉絮一般的濕雲却還笨重地壓在羣山頂部，湖上籠罩着銀紗様的輕霧，湖水是靜的，這時没有游船，也不聞繚人鞋跟的鐘聲。我放輕了脚步，悄悄地邁進着·我在「茯苓糕水晶糕」的呌賣聲中跨上了望南京方面開駛的浙江省公路局的汽車，六點多鐘，我聽了呌喊出命運的悲慘的悽厲呌賣的最後一聲，那時車已開了，同時我遞了最後的一縷視線給西子。</p>
<p>（二）竹徑</p>
<p>汽車剛過湖濱，轉了一個彎兒，便在修車廠的門外停住了，幾個工人開始把機件修理了一番，乘車的客人也全都注視着工人的手，蹙着眉尖，似乎是有些不耐煩了，我也不由得吁了一聲無可佘何的悶氣。我心裏想想··咱中國人做事總是臨時抱佛脚的，車子在開駛的時候反而停住在修理。</p>
<p>幸而工人的手脚快，祇修理了半小時的工夫，車輛便會行駛自如了，全車乘客間的低氣壓也就消失了，每一個人都顯得很生動，尤其是兩隻靈活的眼睛</p>
<p>一路都很順利，不久，車輛便駛上了「東　」「上柏）之間的竹徑，這竹徑，我並不誇張地説··總有六七里路長，沉醉的紅土山道的兩旁，全都密密地排擠着竹子，新　的葉色層疊地堆成了嬌綠的海，數不清的竹竿隨着汽車的速度在閃動，這閃動着的數不清的竹竿，好像是羣鶴在跳舞，也如十萬隻鴕鳥在競步。</p>
<p>（三）三峽之型</p>
<p>車子在羣山中奔馳着，好像一隻無敵的野獸走上了每日熟走了的道路，没有猶豫，也没有停滯，正如一陳旋風似的掠過了那紅得觸眼的山間窄道。</p>
<p>過了菁山，車子便很費勁地爬上了一個山坡，這時道兒的兩邊都翌立着險峻的山巖，這山巖甚高，天空都被夾小了，假如山巖是羣山的縮影，汽車道是浩淼的揚子江，那麽這豈不是巴東三峽的小小的模型嗎？</p>
<p>（四）美的畫幅</p>
<p>乘客們的眼全都望住窗外，默無一語地。我的對面，正有着一個長方的窗子，從這長方的窗子裏望出是狠有趣的，有時從中看得松林上露出一角靑山，有時都是盛夏的明綠夾着的紅土道上行動着幾點人影。這窗子的框邊，正像一幀畫幅的框邊，這被框在當間的是自然間最美的一角，是美的畫幅，可是縱使是美的畫幅喲，總不能像這風景似的跟隨着車輪輾轉的速度在幻變的。</p>
<p>或馬雙樓記（八九）</p>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第十一回　偏枯小邑瞻仰牙旌　猥瑣羣流呵從騶蹕</p>
<p>當他們剛走進縣城西門的當兒。就早已驚動了滿城中民衆。聚集了許多男女老幼在街道兩旁站立着。似擺隊相迎般引領企足的觀看。比看什麽城隍出會一樣感有興趣。看着看着。人羣中並還交頭接耳竊竊私語起來。互相參證他們那明敏正確的判斷。兩乘騾車中所坐着的。必是兩員高官。也就是這一行列中的大頭腦。但頭腦不能有同等並行的兩個。便又猜到這準是一文一武。或是一正一副。只是一晃而過。没看清那兩位高官的儀表。不能藉重於麻衣相法的一知半解。細細評定誰比誰的福分好和位分大。以看將來的應騐如何。像押寳一樣好要子。究還不無遺憾。然而另有拿得穏猜得準的處所。他們此來必是往長興大旅館歇馬。却是人所共信。毫無疑義。因爲城中旅店雖多。頂兒上尖兒上没備最佳排場最闊地方最好的。實只有長興大旅館一家。歷來省城中到的官府。照例不能擺駕到小客棧中去受委屈。自從長興大旅館一設立。這種仕宦行臺。已統歸他一家包攬包辦。也可算是本地方無人不曉的一項常識。毋須别有討論。並且在這個行列裏還有個特别的發見。那最前頭一個像是城隍出會裝判官騎頂馬的大胖子。有好些人都認得他是本地方頂有名聲的大紳士。官印和綽號。呌做鄥四閻王鄥進祿鄥四爺。一向隨使出進縣衙。與縣太爺稱兄道弟。平起平坐。專替一般鄉老們暗中説合官司。有求必應。平日若有人要去找他老人家辦點什麽事。只有三處地方才找得着他的踪跡。第一是縣衙。第二是他新娶一個士娼所組織的小家庭。第三便是這冠蓋往來的長興大旅館。他長年在裏面留有一間屋子。專供受理案件接談訟事之用。彷彿是一個律師事務所。如今以他老人家那大的身分。不惜紆尊降貴。爲這兩位新到的大官騎頂馬。自可想見這兩位大官地位聲勢的赫耀。是絶對不同等閒。</p>

<p>滬廠之產業　記者以滬兵工廠棄原有廠房而分配金陵三廠、另建新屋、似太不經濟、但據熟悉該廠事務者談、謂事非盡如此、蓋該廠僅在滬地產一項、近八百畝、浦東藥庫、有四五十畝、且沿浦設立商廠、地頗適宜、以每畝四千元計算、此項收入、即將超四五百萬、以此而另築新廠房、何患不敷、所以中央廢滬廠而分配至金陵等三廠、實緣此也、否則、當此財政竭蹶之時、反增此一筆築廠費、恐無此寛裕、何况其尙有廠屋可以變賣乎、記者以其所談近理、姑誌之、</p>
<p>二代表談話　昨記者聞晋京代表槍彈廠主任林爲榕·砲彈廠主任王承　·二氏農間返滬、亟趨叩詢經過、據林王二代表談、略謂、余等二人、二十一日抵京、當偕同胡處長及因公留京之製砲廠主任陳世鴻·晋謁軍政部陳代部長（儀）詳陳、（一）滬廠機器拆卸運杭、將逾四月、如不從速設法裝置、恐銹爛後不堪再用、（二）拆卸機器時、因係緊急處置、致有一種機器之零件、分裝數箱、或數種機器之零件、共裝一箱、是以滬廠機器、如整個遷移裝用、並無若何困難、若採納素昧於滬廠情形之德國顧問布魯考馬丁二人之建議、將滬廠機器、分散於金陵漢陽鞏縣三廠、恐因零件凌亂、大部機器、將被廢棄、（三）機器分與各廠、亦須各行建築廠屋、加增動力、所費實屬不資、不如整個保留、利用舊地、或遷地蓋房、利用商電、租費較廉、（四）滬廠歷年來出品精良、成本低廉、兵工署考績之時、推爲第一、此次抗日之役、兵工廠全體職工、在危險情形之下、努力合作、奮不顧身、對於十九路軍彈源接濟、一個月之出品、幾與往昔二個半月之出品相等、兵工署曾傳令嘉奬、慰勉逾常、嗣後奉令拆卸機器、遷往浙省、原期早定廠基、從速開工、乃四個月以來、音息杳然、停薪留職之職員、以及臨時遣散之工人、有因受經濟壓迫懸樑投浦自盡者弱者如此、强者將鋌而走險矣、因之陳次長對於機器應從速裝用、及不宜分散之理由、至爲明瞭、而對於維持整個滬廠使職工不致失業、以重國民經濟、尤萬分關心、當允轉電蔣委員長、請對於德國顧問之建議、重加考慮、總期滬廠前途之進行、合乎發展國計民生之原則云云、嗣林王二君又云、晋謁陳次長後、復晋謁兵署署長洪中、及訪署中各科長、對於滬廠情形、根據事實、詳加解釋、日前兵工署因參照德國顧問之建議有「處理上海兵工廠機器材料委員會」之組織、現陳氏以南京未得蔣委員長回電之前、該委員會擬暫緩進行、總之滬廠停辦與否、尙未奉有明令、廠中亦無趕辦結束之現象、現此項整個保留滬廠機器、不使分散各廠、致受損失之條陳、已由陳氏接受、則滬廠當不致歸於消滅云云、聞林王二氏日内仍須赴京、與胡嗣鴻氏完成該項工作、</p>

<p>工潮起因　藥業同業公會、外塲與内塲職工、曾經實業部中央訓練部劃分、對於外塲替工問題、經六月十五日開會議决、登記外塲店員由公會介紹至各店、接充替工、拒絶藥業工會遣派外塲替工、規定會員違犯者、開除會籍、通告各店遵守辦理、以致發生馮存仁·蔡同德·等藥店拒絶工會派遣替工糾紛、全體五千餘職工、於二十三日、由工會召集各區職工代表　席會議、以事關重大、特舉行會員大會、討論進行方針</p>

<p>發生糾紛　討論時、對於資方拒絶外塲替工、一部份工人、主張全體罷工、以促資方之覺悟、黨政機關代表、當極力勸導、嗣因已爲工會開除會籍之方政·擅自發言、以致引起糾紛、形勢甚爲嚴重、全塲秩序混亂、幸經市公安局一區三分所增派警士、前往維持秩序、始得平靜、繼續討論、</p>

<p>本埠高昌廟海軍飛機處之江鳳號飛機、前日由杭、偕同江鵬·江鴈·江鴻·出發來滬、飛至海鹽、風候變幻、江鳳不得已降落、其餘亦以逆風折返杭州、昨早江鳳繼續飛駛到滬、人機無恙、茲將經過錄誌如下、</p>
<p>飛機遷杭　海軍飛機處、自沈德燮任廠長、即將一部分飛機、搬至虹橋機塲、爲敎練學員駕駛之用、停置商昌廟者、僅水面機三四架而已、嗣以日軍在滬作戰、恐被破壞、遂全部遷杭州筧橋、詎未幾日機追踵而至、竟被炸毁兩機、餘機再遷西湖、計江鴻·江鷗·江鵬·江鴈·江鷁·江鴦·江鵷·江鵾·江鳳·等偵察機九架、現沈氏以滬戰已平、遂令陸續飛返上海、</p>
<p>四機出發　該處沈處長命令飛滬、除江鷗先日返滬、至前日又有江鳳·江鴻·江鴈·江鵬·四機飛滬、當前日午後、在杭出發、天氣甚佳、詎將近海鹽、風候忽轉、原定每小時行二百八十華里、因遇逆風、祇百里、預計一小時半可抵滬、飛約二百里、尙未至黄浦、因之江鴻三機、恐油不足、中途折回、但其時祇江鳳號仍鼓勇前進、</p>
<p>被迫降落　江鳳號駕駛者、即爲該處敎練員西人蒲里、當飛近海鹽、已感風逆、旋不見其後三機、而海鹽氣候更惡劣、於是不得不在内江降落、時已在午後四時、蒲將全機檢查一過、飛滬不及、遂停宿江面一宵、</p>
<p>江鳳到滬　江鳳並無損壞、於翌晨即縱續飛行、上午七時二十分飛離海鹽、八時四十五分飛抵上海、因係水機、即在高昌廟海軍飛機處前浦江中降落、國聞社記者午至該廠、見江鳳已入廠、正在檢騐、至於折返杭州之三機、據聞今日天好、仍將飛滬、</p>

<p>將軍依舊守邊關，不斬樓蘭誓不還，屈節偷生非素志，立時反正保河山。南方風氣本稱强，一旅孤軍抗日長，徹底消除亡國恨，敢憑鐵血輔中央。閘北烽烟火勢張，堪憐浩刦勝洪楊，圖書文化成焦土，不減當年秦始皇。虎口偷生一月餘，倉皇避難不寗居，回頭北望愁眉鎖，昔日繁華今已墟。飛機軋軋任盤旋，國難臨頭命係天，破曉怱怱逃虎窟，舉家驚駭未曾眠。砲火連天徹夜驚，災民遷避悵餘生，滬江南北同遭劫，合境時聞刁斗聲。停戰於今兩月期，倭兵撤退尙稽遲，國聯會議雖終結，發奮國强在此時。僞設機關荆棘多，逢人勒索奈誰何，追呼不異石壕吏，老婦出門涕涙沱。</p>

<p>— 白匋</p>
<p>在夏天，冰淇淋已經成了我們消夏的唯一妙品。當着溽暑薰人的時候，拿着銀匙一匙一匙的送進嘴，或者用舌啜吃着，却是最快意不過的事。</p>
<p>上等冰淇淋的構造異常柔潤。這種柔潤要靠各種原料配合時的分量，和使牠結冰的技術而定。</p>
<p>普通冰淇淋的配合方法··百分之六十到七十都是水，其餘的爲糖，牛乳，色及脂肪。脂肪存在牛乳的小球胞中，這要用顯微鏡才能看見。糖是溶化了再放進去的。在使牠結冰時，要使牠凍結得異常細微而且透明，愈細則愈妙，所以我們要把他放在製冰淇淋的箱中，用力擾攪。一直到你用舌嘗了之後，覺得異常柔潤爲止。</p>
<p>要知道這些原料是否配合得十分好，只要看他們混合擾攪之後，冰淇淋是否起了小空氣泡没有。</p>
<p>當冰淇淋製成之後，可以把他分成薄塊，一塊一塊裝在紙匣裏，然後使他與空氣隔絶，或者放到冰箱裏去。</p>
<p>你須用力將空氣打進冰淇淋使他發生黏性，或者在原料中，配合一些兒殿粉（玉蜀黍粉），樹膠，乾的蛋黄，鷄蛋等進去，這些東西配合的比例占極小數。</p>

<p>私立學校因爲經費的來源，都仰給於學費的收入，學生自然多多益善，多一個，好一個。但在上海，私立學校，三步一家，五步一所，多如過江之鯽，你如果不明辦學校的藝術，那包管你會失敗。辦學校也有藝術，局外人聽見怕會不信。但在上海辦學校的人，的確非有辦學藝術的手腕不可。</p>
<p>在這裏，先要一説招生廣告，這種廣告，並不是登在報上的廣告，是貼在牆壁上的廣告。因爲上海的學校，在暑假，寒假的時候，都用五顔六色的廣告，張貼在牆壁上面，眼前暑假快到，壁上的招生廣告，又在一天天的多起來了。</p>
<p>「貼招生廣告要比别人家貼得早些，才能引人注意。」</p>
<p>「如果學校已經立案，那在廣告的上面，要冠以「市敎育局立案」的字様，這様憑你内容糟到如何，别人見了，以爲你的學校能夠立案，一定是非常完美。」</p>
<p>「校董的裏面，如果有婦孺皆知的名人，你須得要把他們的大名印在廣告上。」</p>
<p>「廣告上所用的字，要藝術化，呆板的字，不能引人注意的。如果另外附帶標語，要多加幾個驚嘆號「！」標點。」</p>
<p>「廣告上紙頭的顔色，和字的顔色，也要配得適當，不能引人注目。像白紙上的黑字，便没有藍字來得容易引人注目，所以配色問題，也須注意！」</p>
<p>「用兩色或三色彩印的招生廣告，中間的字，印成半個紅，半個綠，當然效力更大，此法大可採用。」</p>
<p>「在各校陸續招生的時候，招生廣告最好每天差人去貼一次，因爲你貼過以後，不久包管有人把别家的招生廣告，貼在上面，把你的廣告蓋没了。」</p>
<p>「至於報紙上的招生廣告，地位要優越，篇幅要佔得多，字要寫得特别，立案的也要標明，有名的校董多寫些上去，比人家先登而後停，·······校長，敎務長，有博士，碩士的銜頭，天然也可印上去。」</p>
<p>上海的學校何其多？要勝利非競爭不可，而招生廣告也是競爭利器之一。唉！熱心敎育的手段，原來如此？</p>
<p>觸目驚心</p>
<h3 id="c242">輪船遇險之後 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 夢漁</p>
<p>前幾天法郵船「喬治斐立巴」號在紅海失火，又有江輪「彝陵」號在宣昌附近觸礁沉没，最近又發現了盛京，新江天等輪幾乎出險的事，這是多麽可怕的慘劇呀！諸位想起當時全船人們驚慌逃命的紛亂情形，又作何感想？但是乘客可以逃命，船員們還是要進行求救方法，這時候船員的緊急工作，諸位大槪不知道罷，兄弟以前服務德國商船，曾經親身遇到這種危險，現在把當時情形，記出來給諸位看看。</p>
<p>我們的船是一只貨船，没有乘客，民國十八年十二月一日半夜誤觸東沙島暗礁，船底破裂了三個大洞，海水像噴泉一様的湧進來，當時情形是危險極了，幸虧離淺灘不遠，船長就一面開足速率，向灘上駛去，一面喚起船員，大家急急穿了救生衣做求救工程，求救的方面，大槪分爲下列幾種··</p>
<p>（一）無綫電拍發求救呼號ＳＯＳ；</p>
<p>（二）燃放求救火箭，（這種火箭用粗竹做成，裏面放了火藥，放時上升數十尺，十哩内船隻都能看見，實在同新年裏玩的月砲一様，不過大點罷了。）若在日間，那麽就不放火箭，而拿懸掛求救旗子來代替；</p>
<p>（三）連續的拉回聲，大約每十秒鐘拉一次。</p>
<p>還有自救的方法··</p>
<p>（一）水手們把救生艇放到船旁水裏，以便大船沉没時逃登艇裏；</p>
<p>（二）船底裏用極大的抽水機，抽出破洞裏進來的水。</p>
<p>後來到底無綫電呌到小呂宋海岸電台，才派了一隻兵艦來施救出險，人們都没有死傷，但是因爲航海規則裏有「救人不救物件」的規定，所以各人的行李衣服都損失了。</p>
<p>我們安全的逹到岸上後，船長對我説··「大家理想中以爲大船沉没後，可以依靠救生艇和救生衣，實際上船隻在海裏沉没太快，别的船來不及來救的話那麽乘客船員必然犧牲生命。你想遇險時大船被風吹浪打，不能自主，以致遇到這種不幸，難道救生艇反而吃得起這種大風浪麽？穿上了救生衣，浮在水面，更没有用，因爲海水冷得很，海浪又大，會得游泳的人，或者可以支持一刻鐘；不會游泳的人，五分鐘就死，這種辦法，用在小江裏那麽的確有效力的」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Is the Sale of Opium Truly Going to be Publicized? - Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei issued a statement on opium policy, saying, "In recent years, opium has not been eradicated in various regions and has become an open secret. Now, in this time of extreme national financial distress, it would be better to implement public sales and combine prohibition with taxation. This would facilitate statistics for the implementation of prohibition and provide a source of revenue to alleviate current difficulties." He also said, "Everything depends on human effort. If managed properly, it may not be impossible to implement. Consider countries like England in India and the United States in the Philippines; their prohibition of opium also adopted the policy of combining prohibition with taxation, and the results were initially not as bad as generally imagined." In summary, Wang's statement implies that the public sale of opium, fortunately, is still as Wang stated, "The central government considers it a major issue and has not yet made a decision." However, a closer look at the statement "If there are other remedies, we are unwilling to implement this last policy" suggests that the underlying message is self-evident: the public sale of opium will ultimately be inevitable. If so, we cannot help but express our firm opposition.</p>
<p>The harm of opium to our nation is known to all. Since the late Qing Dynasty, the government has repeatedly and strictly issued prohibitions, repeatedly expressing its determination to strictly prohibit it. However, in reality, growers, sellers, and smokers remain as before. Military personnel continue to coerce cultivation, smuggling, and transportation. This trend is growing daily. This contradictory phenomenon is due to the government's inability to exercise its authority and its failure to make a thorough determination to prohibit it. Therefore, laws and regulations are treated like discarded shoes, and the government cannot maintain its authority. Opium cannot be eradicated and becomes an open secret. The problem is not the prohibition itself, but the lack of effort in prohibition. Orders are not followed, and authority is not established. Who should be blamed? The matter is obvious. Now, the government is not effectively enforcing the ban on opium but instead plans to publicly sell it. Does this mean that the government believes that the harm of opium has not yet spread to all our people and that it must place our nation in a state of eternal damnation?</p>
<p>Wang stated, "In this time of extreme national financial distress, the public sale of opium can provide a source of revenue to alleviate this difficulty." From a short-term perspective, this is indeed a good plan. However, if we consider the distant future, a few decades later, and the future of our nation, then even a three-year-old child knows that this method of opening up a source of revenue is like drinking poison to quench thirst, and that it is enough to destroy our nation invisibly. All land will be used to grow opium, agricultural production will be cut off, and all people will smoke opium, falling into a realm of ghosts. In a few decades, it will not only be as Lin Zexu said, "There will be no funds to raise and no soldiers to train," but there will also be no grain to eat and no people to use. The current predicament may be alleviated, but what about the future disaster? Focusing on small gains while forgetting great harm, emphasizing immediate benefits while neglecting distant disasters – is this how those who plot for the country should plant the seeds of national destruction?</p>
<p>Advocates of the fallacy of public opium sales often cite the examples of the United States in the Philippines, England in India, and Japan in Taiwan. However, they do not know that the public sale of opium by England and Japan, combining prohibition with taxation, was a measure to deal with colonies. Moreover, the United States in the Philippines did not use public sales to create a source of revenue for the government, so it was effective. England in India was different, so Gandhi's opposition to England focused on the opium policy as one of its most important points. As for the Japanese in Taiwan, they used the opium policy as a means to poison the Taiwanese people and our overseas Chinese, sparing no effort to induce Taiwanese and overseas Chinese to smoke opium. However, if they induced Japanese soldiers and civilians to smoke, they would be sentenced to death. In 1930, the Japanese authorities reissued smoking licenses in Taiwan. When three Japanese people applied for licenses, they were not only denied but also forced to quit. From this, it can be seen that the opium policies of these countries towards their colonies were all for ulterior motives. We truly do not understand why our government must compare itself to a colony and hate our people by imitating the methods of imperialists to exterminate the nations of colonies, treating our people in this way, and still saying that it combines prohibition with taxation and that the results are not as bad as generally imagined. Is this deceiving others or deceiving ourselves?</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 17th year [of the Republic], Chiang Kai-shek said in his speech at the First National Anti-Opium Conference, "From now on, the National Government will absolutely not derive a single penny from opium. If there is any such suspicion, we will consider it bankrupt and distrust it." His words are still ringing in our ears. Recently, the government reaffirmed the ban on opium, and the Executive Yuan even resolved to commend Chairman Han of Shandong Province for his vigorous efforts in banning opium. If the government truly intends to publicly sell opium, combining prohibition with taxation, and earn money from opium, then with the attention of both domestic and foreign observers, what will become of our national dignity and the integrity of our people? Mencius said, "A sense of shame and aversion is common to all men." Does our government not consider this at all?</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen's admonition against drugs stated, "The opium business is absolutely incompatible with the National Government entrusted by the people. Anyone who advocates legalizing the opium business or expresses surrender to the evil forces of opium, even as a temporary expedient, is a public enemy of the people." He also said, "The war against opium must absolutely not be compromised or abandoned. Responsible government agencies, for their own private convenience and immediate interests, if they lower the flag and cease fighting against opium, no matter how short the time, it is an act of national betrayal." This admonition is firm and decisive, showing Sun Yat-sen's hatred of opium and his determination to eradicate it. After Sun Yat-sen's death, there may be some aspects of his entire legacy that can be changed, but this anti-opium admonition should be absolutely unchangeable. How can the opium policy that even the Qing Dynasty and the Northern Warlords did not dare to implement be now resolutely implemented by a government that claims to be revolutionary? If Sun Yat-sen had a spirit in heaven, he would surely weep bitterly for our country and our people because of this opium policy. If the government still cannot bear to abandon Sun Yat-sen's legacy, then try to think deeply and silently. Can it really remain unmoved? We sincerely hope that the government can find other remedies in its helplessness and never implement this last resort that will destroy the nation and exterminate the people.</p>

<p>Japan Instigates Puppet Organization</p>
<h3 id="e13">To Seize Postal Rights in Eastern Provinces <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges Protest with Japan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japan is actively attempting to seize China's postal rights in the Eastern Provinces. The Director of the Japanese Bureau of Communications has been appointed as the Director of the Postal Bureau of the puppet organization in the Eastern Provinces and has led members of the Bureau of Communications to take office. He has also incited the puppet organization to force Chinese post offices to use the puppet "Great Harmony" era name and will implement the use of Japanese-printed stamps on July 1. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the above reports, has notified the Japanese ambassador, lodging a serious protest, stating that the Northeast puppet organization has various illegal attempts to seize China's postal rights in the Eastern Provinces. This active behavior disrupts the integrity of China's postal administration and is extremely illegal. Therefore, before the facts are accomplished, we urge the Japanese government to pay serious attention. If the puppet organization disregards this and seizes the Chinese government's postal rights in the Eastern Provinces, the Chinese government will have no choice but to regard it as purely instigated by the Japanese government, and the Japanese government shall bear all responsibilities. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Feipeng, Minister of Communications, spoke about the puppet state seizing postal rights. The Ministry of Communications has drafted countermeasures. The first step is for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to Japan. The second step is that if the puppet state uses force to seize the postal rights on July 1, the only option is to order the suspension of postal services in the Northeast, order all postal employees to return to Nanjing, allocate them to various bureaus, temporarily arrange them, and then find a solution.

<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, the National Government sent identical official documents to the representatives in China of the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, including England, the United States, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal. The documents requested that each government pay serious attention to the Japanese government's preparation to formally recognize "Manchukuo" and to take immediate steps to prevent the Japanese government from recognizing this illegal organization created by Japanese soldiers, thereby safeguarding the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty and maintaining peace in the Far East. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, sources in political circles indicated that the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty will take action soon regarding Japan's proposed recognition of "Manchukuo," as they view this move as a direct violation of the spirit and letter of the Nine-Power Treaty. The treaty guarantees the territorial and administrative integrity of China, and Japan is one of the signatories. It is also heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged two protests with Japan, one against Manchukuo's seizure of postal services and one against interference in the customs administration in Dalian and other places.

<p>All Arms Confiscated</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang shipped 4,000 rifles, 800 boxes of bullets, and six machine guns to Leizhou on the 21st via a merchant ship from Shui Dong.

<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Jingwei and Luo Wengan sent telegrams to Chen Jitang, advising him not to attack Hainan to avoid the resurgence of internal conflicts and hinder diplomacy. Chen Jitang held a meeting at headquarters on the 24th, and all agreed that the use of troops in Hainan by one group was in response to the request of the Hainanese people and to send troops to suppress the Communists. Because all ten counties of Hainan, except for Haikou and Qiongshan, have fallen into the hands of bandits, the one group has the responsibility to protect the territory and secure the people and cannot but send troops to suppress them. It was decided to reply to Wang and Luo with this intention via telegram. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Liuan Still Surrounded by Bandits</p>
<p>Government Troops Delaying in Guanting, Not Advancing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Zhonglou and other refugees from Lu'an, Huoqiu, and Shou counties tearfully expressed their grievances to various newspapers, stating that the news in the newspapers on the 21st that the bandits in western Anhui had been defeated was completely false propaganda and did not correspond to the facts. The four cities of Liuan are still surrounded by bandits. The bandits in Huoqiu are still entrenched in the Beixindianzi area, and their forces are extremely rampant. The large army stationed in Hefei is stationed in Guanting and has not advanced. The large army stationed in Zhengyang has only begun to arrange to cross the river and has not made contact. How can there be talk of defeat? At present, no fewer than 100,000 refugees from various counties are gathered in Bengbu, suffering untold hardships. They are eagerly awaiting the National Army to earnestly advance and suppress the bandits and relieve their distress. The reports in the newspapers actually give the central government a sense of belittling the Anhui bandits and repeating the mistake of allowing them to grow stronger, leaving our refugees with no hope of returning home forever. We implore you to show kindness and to refrain from military units submitting false and exaggerated reports of success. We respectfully kowtow with sincerity. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Legation today released a statement regarding the tragic murder of Catholic Father Lai Pu, as follows: It is heard that Father Lai Pu traveled alone from Yanji to Wulingtun (transliteration) on June 5th to attend the funeral of a Catholic priest. He did not have any companions. At 9 PM that evening, while traveling somewhere, he encountered a team of Japanese sentries searching for bandits. After inquiring about Lai Pu's nationality and the purpose of his trip, they allowed him to pass. Soon, a Korean brought news that Lai Pu had been killed and his body was lying on the riverbank one mile from Xinbali (transliteration). The Japanese police chief, upon receiving the information, immediately sent a police officer to find the priest's remains. It was then learned that the local Catholics had found them. The Japanese Consul-General, in order to verify the case, urgently sent another police officer to assist the first officer. As the two were heading towards their destination, they encountered a Chinese priest, Zhou, carrying the priest's remains. With Zhou's permission, a Korean doctor examined the body. Because the body had been tragically mutilated and local communists and bandits were constantly appearing, it is believed that the murderer was a bandit who opposed Catholicism. The culprit has not yet been apprehended. (Reuters Dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance has standardized four measures for tax exemption on exports of local goods: (1) For items such as silks and satins, straw hats, lacquerware, paper umbrellas, and other local goods, if they are sold domestically, a transit tax should be levied. If they are sold abroad, an export tax should be exempted. If it is declared at the port of departure that they will be transshipped abroad at the second port, customs will release them without tax. A note should be attached to the declaration form at the transshipment port with a stamp. If they are not transshipped abroad, the customs at the second port will levy the transit tax. If it is declared that they will be re-exported within one year, the transit tax will be levied first, and the tax will be refunded when they are actually exported within the time limit. The current guarantee method should be abolished immediately. (2) For items sold domestically that are exempt from transit tax, but subject to export tax when sold abroad, if it is declared that they will be re-exported abroad at the second port, the export tax should be levied. If the goods are not exported after one year, the customs will refund the tax. (3) If goods are declared for export at the first port and export tax is paid, and then re-declared for import at the second port, the second port should calculate the difference and refund or collect the difference accordingly. (4) For goods sold domestically that have already paid transit tax, if they are re-exported within one year, the customs at the port of export should waive the difference between the export tax and the transit tax and collect the difference separately.

<p>Payment Orders Should Be Issued by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Audit Department believes that the principal and interest on foreign debts have been repaid by China, allocated from customs and salt revenue by the Maritime Customs Service and the Salt Revenue Inspection Office. Now that the general budget for the 20th year has been announced, the exact amount of foreign debt principal and interest to be repaid this year has also been listed. If this expenditure is still allocated directly by the Customs Inspection Office without the Ministry of Finance issuing a payment order for verification and signing, it would hinder financial unification and also be a significant defect in supervising budget execution. The Department's audit meeting yesterday decided to send a letter to the Ministry of Finance requesting that a payment order be issued before each payment is made, sent to the Department for verification and signing, and then distributed to the Customs Inspection Office as a basis for allocation.

<p>The World Economy Has Not Yet Recovered</p>
<p>Germany Cannot Be Asked to Pay</p>
<p>French and German Representatives Hold Direct Negotiations Yesterday</p>
<p>Reuters, Lausanne, 23rd: MacDonald and Herriot spoke at length for two hours today. It is widely believed that this conversation is an important turning point in the indemnity conference. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain and Commerce Minister Runciman, and French Finance Minister Martin also had lengthy discussions at the same time. The British and French Prime Ministers then joined the conversation, and discussions continued for another hour and a half in the afternoon. The results of the conversation are kept secret. When reporters asked Herriot about the purpose of the conversation as he left the venue, he declined to answer. A press release stated that today's discussions were "useful and friendly." The discussions have now been suspended temporarily so that the German and French delegations can exchange views. Herriot will return to Paris at the end of the week, and Papen will also return to Berlin, presumably to seek the views of their respective governments. Runciman will meet with MacDonald today and then travel to London to consult with the British Cabinet, and will return here on Saturday or Sunday.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Lausanne, 23rd: Britain, France and Italy have agreed in principle that the Hoover moratorium plan should apply to debts and indemnities between European countries until the world returns to normal. It is also reported that after a three-hour conversation between British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Prime Minister Herriot today, the two have tentatively agreed on the following four principles. France will now begin negotiations with Germany based on these principles, starting on Friday. The four principles are:</p>
<p>(1) The solution must be practical and permanent and become the final solution. (2) The solution must contain the intention to restore world confidence. (3) Germany cannot be asked to pay now or during the recovery period of the global economic crisis. (4) If payments are to be resumed in the future, their nature must not disrupt international commercial coordination.</p>
<p>Observers here believe that Britain and France have agreed to the third item, that is, Germany cannot be asked to pay now or during the recovery period of the global economic crisis. This means that if Germany is willing to accept the principle of resuming payments after the world economy recovers in the future, the indemnities can be suspended for a long time.</p>

<p>(Kuomintang News Agency, Lausanne, 24th) The Franco-German negotiations, which are crucial to the fate of the Lausanne Conference, began at 10:00 AM this morning. German Chancellor Brüning went to the palace hotel where the French delegation was staying and briefly exchanged views with French Premier Herriot before temporarily leaving. Half an hour later, he returned with Foreign Minister Curtius, Finance Minister Dietrich, Minister of Economy Warmuth, and President of the Reichsbank Luther to the palace hotel and conferred with the French representatives until 12:45 PM, when they adjourned for lunch. In addition to Herriot, the French side included Finance Minister Germain-Martin, Minister of Commerce Durand, and the renowned financier Quesnay. It is reported that negotiations will resume at 5:30 PM this afternoon (some say 2:00 PM) and are expected to continue until Herriot returns to France and Brüning returns to Germany. It is hoped that a trial agreement can be reached by then, to be brought back to the cabinets of both countries for discussion. Today, the financial advisors of both countries were present, indicating that the discussions focus more on economic issues than political ones. It is said that there has been significant progress in the negotiations. When leaving for lunch, French Premier Herriot told foreign reporters that the talks had created a good atmosphere and a good tone. It is reported that during this morning's meeting, the German Finance Minister described the perilous state of Germany's finances and economy at length. Furthermore, according to the German Chancellor's spokesperson, Brüning will make it clear to the French Premier that Germany, whether now or in the future, simply cannot pay any more reparations. He also reiterated Germany's willingness to join France in jointly seeking the transformation of the European economy and to conclude a mutual consultation pact as a political guarantee.</p>
<h3 id="e89">German Public Opinion Remains Pessimistic <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency, Berlin, 24th) Since President Hoover proposed a large-scale disarmament plan, the eyes of the German people and political circles had temporarily shifted to Geneva. Now they have returned to Lausanne. With the direct negotiations between German and French representatives starting at 10:00 AM this morning, the Lausanne Conference has entered a critical phase. British Prime Minister MacDonald had tried his best to mediate between the two sides, but his efforts were in vain. Therefore, direct exchange of views between Germany and France is now seen as the only way to break the deadlock and prevent the conference from failing. However, German newspapers this morning frankly expressed pessimism about the prospects of the Franco-German negotiations, believing that, as far as is known, these direct negotiations not only lack a common basis, but also that the two sides' opinions remain far apart. The French still insist that after a long-term suspension of payments, the amount can be greatly reduced, but payments must continue in any case. Germany insists that it cannot pay any more. In addition, although Belgium has a detailed plan to lend a large sum to Germany, supposedly devised by the Belgian financier Francqui, German public opinion has unanimously rejected it. As the German "Welt am Sonntag" newspaper put it, the Belgian plan may alleviate the symptoms, but it is like giving a shot of morphine, only providing temporary relief and not a real cure. Although it would be very beneficial in the current situation, it would cause regret in the future. Therefore, it is practically not worth discussing by the German representatives.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Important Proposals from Belgian and German Representatives <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>(Reuters, Lausanne, 23rd) Two important proposals were put forward at today's reparations meeting. The German representative Brüning proposed the establishment of a broad customs organization, allowing major countries to participate in the existing Danube River plan. The Belgian representative proposed the organization of a large-scale German trust, to which all of Germany's public utilities could be attached, with their shares being used to compensate the creditor nations.</p>
<p>(Kuomintang News Agency, Lausanne, 24th) Today, the Belgian delegation attending the Lausanne Conference claimed that they had drafted an outline of Belgium's proposed plan for the rehabilitation of the European economy and finance and sent it to British Prime Minister MacDonald, the chairman. The plan is divided into three parts: (1) reorganizing German public utilities to make them more susceptible to measures aimed at guaranteeing Germany's financial stability; (2) establishing a lending institution, or placing it under the control of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, to support the economy and finance of Eastern and Central Europe; and (3) improving the European tariff system to restore commercial exchanges, with the ultimate goal of gradually reducing import duties. Belgian experts are also actively discussing a plan with representatives from various countries to circulate global gold reserves and restore credit.</p>

<p>(Kuomintang News Agency, Lausanne, 23rd) Today, the Austrian Chancellor announced that after the Joint Committee of the League of Nations' final attempt to persuade France to agree to lend Austria 300 million schillings failed, Austria had no choice but to temporarily suspend all foreign debt interest payments and temporarily suspend foreign trade remittances. However, this suspension is only temporary. Once the League of Nations' efforts to assist Austria succeed, payments will be made as before.</p>

<p>Japan Has No War Debt</p>
<p>Reducing Armaments Would Endanger National Defense</p>
<p>US States Europe Must Disarm For US To Reduce Debt</p>
<p>(Reuters, Geneva, 23rd) With the exception of France, Japan, and the smaller Entente countries that support France, all other countries now support President Hoover's disarmament proposal. China and Russia are also among those who support it.</p>
<p>(Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 24th) The Japanese Foreign Ministry received the telegram regarding Hoover's proposed one-third reduction in armaments last night. The Foreign Ministry immediately held a meeting with the Army and Navy Ministries. After various discussions, the following consensus seems to have been reached in principle: (1) Armaments should be based on each country's specific circumstances, and cannot be uniformly reduced by one-third. If implemented, it would change the ratio of existing forces in each country and create major national defense problems. Japan cannot rashly agree. (2) Japan cannot predict the future of the Manchurian problem and related international relations. Therefore, at present, it cannot agree to such an indiscriminate disarmament plan. (3) The motive for the proposal is to alleviate the global depression by using the equivalent of the reduction in military spending to reduce war debts and revive the European economy. However, Japan has no involvement in the war debt issue.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 23rd) Leading figures in American political circles believe that under no circumstances will the United States participate in a security pact such as the one proposed by the French representative Paul-Boncour during the discussion of President Hoover's disarmament plan in Geneva. The US believes that Hoover's plan already provides France with greater political security than any new plan.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 24th) The State Department stated that the success of President Hoover's plan largely depends on France and Japan. The State Department has finally acknowledged that the plan clearly implies that if Europe cannot implement disarmament, the United States will disregard its applications to cancel or reduce war debts. It also stated that the United States cannot reduce its air force and navy unless the European powers reduce their armies.</p>

<p>Ishii's Proposal Not Akin to the Monroe Doctrine</p>
<p>American Newspapers Express Disapproval</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 24th) The "Financial News" today stated, "The seizure of Dalian customs revenue by the 'Manchurian government' is clearly sponsored by the Japanese government. This move is likely to cause indirect consequences, which is deeply regrettable. If other provinces follow suit and intercept the central government's tax revenues, the consequences would be unimaginable. Customs is an important link in uniting the provinces of China. Without it, China will become even more disintegrated. Therefore, the local interception of customs revenue will cause serious harm to China's finances and economy in the long term."</p>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 24th) The "New York World-Telegram" today published an editorial stating that Viscount Ishii's proposal cannot be likened to the Monroe Doctrine because it contains a "special spirit." From now on, it should only be called the "Ishii Doctrine." The United States cannot possibly agree to it.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Baghdad, 23rd) The large-scale operation of British aircraft transporting troops was completed today. A unit of British troops stationed in Egypt has arrived here on nine aircraft. This sudden action has aroused much speculation. The authorities issued a public announcement explaining that Assyrian soldiers had expressed their intention to retire, so the authorities decided to transport Egyptian British troops here by air to temporarily fill the vacancies. After new Iraqi recruits are enlisted to replenish the vacancies left by the retiring Assyrian soldiers, the British troops arriving here today will return to their original station in Egypt.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Manila, 24th) The Governor-General of the Philippines, Roosevelt, issued an order to immediately revoke the customs order prohibiting foreigners from entering certain ports in the Philippines. The second order was promulgated by the Acting Governor-General Butte on February 24, prohibiting foreigners from entering any small port in the Philippines. This order was intended to prevent the illegal entry of Chinese and the influx of Japanese into Mindanao. However, since the promulgation of this order, American and foreign merchants have protested, claiming that the order is discriminatory and unconstitutional. Roosevelt now believes that this ban conflicts with existing US treaty agreements regarding passports, so he has revoked the ban.</p>

The Emperor was attended by Nara, the Aide-de-Camp, Army Minister Araki, and Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in. First, Lieutenant General Ueda was summoned.

<h3 id="e99">British Labour Party's Motion of No Confidence in the Government Rejected <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>(Reuters, London, 23rd) The Labour Party introduced a motion of no confidence in the current government in the House of Commons tonight. Labour leader Lansbury stated that the nation had granted the current government the power to act freely to restore national prosperity, but the current government had completely failed in this mission, as can be seen from the gradual decline in British trade. Britain's current position is not as good as Russia's. Acting Prime Minister Baldwin argued that the tariffs implemented by the current government are gradually achieving their desired effect, but whether they have been fully realized will only be known in two or three years. There are many thorns in the machinery of international trade that still need to be removed. The cancellation of European reparations and war debts is a necessary step to remove these thorns. Britain is better equipped than any other country in the world to cope with the economic crisis. Britain should not have high expectations, as the only permanent solution is the complete recovery of trade. After a lengthy debate, the motion of no confidence was defeated by 446 votes to 47.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Wang et al. Depart from Beiping and Return South <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Left a Letter for Feng When Passing Through Tai'an</p>
<p>Final Meeting with Zhang</p>
<p>(Beiping Correspondence) Wang Jingwei, Luo Wengan, Song Ziwen, Zeng Zhongming, and Gu Weijun, etc., have held three meetings with the Investigation Team in Beiping in recent days. After exchanging various opinions, Wang, Song, Luo, etc., regarding the financial, military, and diplomatic issues of the North, because Zhang Xueliang was unable to personally participate in the Lushan Conference, originally intended to meet with Zhang during their trip to the North. During their several days in Beiping, they mostly met with the Investigation Team. Although they had several meetings with Zhang, they had not been able to have a thorough discussion. Therefore, they were originally scheduled to leave Beiping on the afternoon of the 21st. However, that evening, Wang et al. still had to meet with Zhang Xueliang to make a final decision on military, political, and diplomatic issues. Therefore, they changed the departure date to the morning of the 22nd. On the morning of the 21st, Luo Wengan went to Sun Chuanfang's residence for a lengthy meeting. At 8:00 AM, Wang, Luo, and Song discussed matters at the Beijing Hotel. In the evening, Song Ziwen and Luo Wengan went to Prince Shuncheng's mansion to meet with Zhang to discuss financial and military matters, which were generally resolved, but diplomatic issues still needed further discussion. It was not until 1:00 AM on the 22nd that Luo and Song returned to the Beijing Hotel. When reporters inquired about the discussions, they all said that they would absolutely keep them secret, and that this time, diplomacy, finance, and military affairs were all part of a whole issue. Furthermore, before leaving Beiping, Wang told reporters</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>that the Japanese government's obstruction of Gu Weijun's mission to Japan had led the government to decide to order Gu to cancel the trip. He said that the last trip to the Northeast was because the Northeast was our territory, and we had the freedom to go or not go, without interference from others. Now, the Japanese government has officially stated that it will refuse Gu entry, so our representative has no need to go. He added that during his several days in Beiping, he had discussed military, political, and diplomatic matters with Director Zhang several times, but because Zhang was not feeling well, the discussions were not lengthy. He planned to meet with Director Zhang again tonight (i.e., the evening of the 21st), and a final result could probably be obtained. He said that because the Nanjing government had many pressing matters to attend to, he had to leave. He was originally scheduled to leave Beiping today (the 21st), but because he still needed to exchange views with Zhang, if there were results tonight, he could leave tomorrow (i.e., the 22nd). When passing through Jinan, he planned to stop briefly to meet with Han Fuqu. Whether he would meet with Feng Yuxiang had not been decided. When reporters asked about the meetings with the Investigation Team in recent days and whether the central government had any more concrete measures besides Minister Song's declaration regarding the forced takeover of customs by the puppet state, he replied that Ministers Luo and Song were responsible for handling it and that he could not disclose anything for the time being.</p>
<p>Scene When Passing Through Tianjin</p>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) Wang et al. left Beiping by special train this morning (the 22nd) and arrived in Tianjin at 9:50 AM. Officials from the city government who came to welcome them at the station included He Yufang, Director of the Industry Bureau; Wang Yuke, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau; Lin Chengxiu, Director of the Construction Bureau; and Chen Baoquan, Director of the Education Bureau. Wang met with them in the train's reception room. Luo Wengan also emerged from another compartment to meet with the welcoming personnel. Luo's eyes were swollen and he looked haggard, which shocked those who met him. It was clear that he was overworked. When Wang passed through Tianjin in 1930, he was energetic and solemn. Recently, he has also appeared slightly thin and frail. According to Wang, Minister Song originally planned to travel with them, but he still had to contact Director Zhang and would stay in Beiping for a few more days. When passing through Jinan, they would stop for about half a day to meet with Chairman Han. They would arrive in Nanjing around the morning of the day after tomorrow. The central government had already formulated a concrete plan for the Northeast issue, but it was not convenient to disclose it at this time. Luo and Song were currently responsible for handling the matter of the puppet state's takeover of Northeast customs.</p>
<p>Meeting with Han When Passing Through Jinan</p>
<p>(Jinan Correspondence) Wang, Luo, et al.'s special train departed from Tianjin today (the 22nd) and arrived in Jinan at 8:30 PM. The provincial government had ordered military police to increase patrols from the provincial government to the train station this morning, and security was tight. Only those with passes were allowed to enter the train station. Those who came to welcome them at the station included Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuqu, Director of the Finance Bureau Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Industry Bureau Wang Fangting, Director of the Construction Bureau Zhang Honglie, Director of the Education Bureau He Siyuan, and Provincial Committee Member Zhang Yue. After the special train arrived at the station, Han Fuqu first led the welcoming personnel onto the train to meet with Wang, Luo, et al. After exchanging greetings, he invited Wang to enter the city and rest at the provincial government. At that time, reporters requested to see him, so Wang spoke with them on the train. What he said was similar to what he had said in Beiping and Tianjin. Finally, he said that when the train passed through Tai'an, it would be in the middle of the night, so it would not be convenient to visit Feng Yuxiang. However, he would leave a letter at that time. Because the Executive Yuan still had a meeting on Friday, he had to rush to attend. After speaking with the reporters, Han accompanied Wang, Luo, et al. in a car to the provincial government chairman's office to rest. Han prepared a meal to welcome them. During the meal, Han reported on Shandong's political and defense situation. Wang expressed satisfaction with Shandong's facilities. At 10:30 PM, they left the provincial government and returned to the special train. At 10:55 PM, they continued south.</p>

<p>To Discuss New Policy Towards Manchuria</p>
<p>(Osaka Asahi Shimbun, Harbin) The Soviet Russian government in Moscow has suddenly ordered 264 key Russian personnel in Manchuria to return home. The families of these personnel have been ordered and are successively leaving Manchuria to return to Russia. It is said that the Soviet Russian government recalled these key personnel to discuss a concrete new policy towards Manchuria.</p>

<p>According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun, after the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Manchukuo, Xie Jieshi, accused Gu Weijun of making propaganda in China Proper that was detrimental to Manchukuo, he made a special inquiry to the League of Nations Investigation Team. Chairman Lytton replied as follows: "Those accompanying us on the trip to Manchuria will be guaranteed to not engage in any political activities outside the scope of the Investigation Team's affairs, regardless of who they are, except for those necessary for the Investigation Team's affairs. Furthermore, we firmly believe that there is no reason to believe that Dr. Gu has engaged in any improper conduct. As for Dr. Gu's various statements before and after his trip to Manchuria, they are entirely Dr. Gu's personal opinions and have nothing to do with our Investigation Team."</p>
<h3 id="e106">Grain from Inland Areas of Jiangsu Province Allowed to Circulate <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Counties Must Not Deliberately Obstruct</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation believes that local merchants are transporting grain for export to make huge profits, resulting in a shortage of grain in the inland areas and high grain prices. Therefore, it is urgent to strictly prohibit this to prevent unscrupulous merchants from smuggling grain out to sea. However, local authorities in various counties often use the pretext of prohibiting exports to deliberately obstruct, causing losses to transporters and affecting the people's food supply. In prohibiting exports, counties should ensure that inland circulation is not obstructed. If there is deliberate obstruction that causes unexpected losses to grain merchants, the people are allowed to report and accuse them so that lawless individuals can be eliminated and the people's livelihood can be protected. The general meeting of all members of the Chamber of Commerce Federation immediately decided to request the Industry Bureau to forward the request to the provincial government, requesting that all counties be instructed not to deliberately obstruct the circulation of grain in the inland areas. If there is illegal detention, the responsible personnel should be severely punished to deter illegal activities and prioritize the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Disputes After the Collision of the Czecho-Fa Shipping Liner <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>(Dalian Correspondence) Regarding the grounding of the Yingkou Czecho-Fa Shipping liner off Sang Island in the Bohai Bay on April 13 of this year, according to a recent investigation, theft, arson, and the burning to death of human lives have occurred after the ship's accident. After the ship's accident, the Dalian Chinese Merchants Insurance Company immediately dispatched the rescue ship Tudao Maru to provide assistance. However, because the ship was overloaded, it did not reach its destination. Only the Datong Company, the agent of the shipowner, sent people to be responsible for guarding the ship. On the 22nd, the Chinese Merchants Insurance Company dispatched another rescue ship, Songpu Maru, to Sang Island to investigate the situation. They learned that the ship's hull had not changed and could be rescued. Therefore, it sailed to Longkou to notify the shipowner to quickly send sailing ships to unload the cargo so that the ship could be towed out. However, the shipowner, Cai, said that he had already sent people from land to Sang Island to hire six large sampans to unload the cargo. On the 25th, the Songpu Maru went to Qingdao again to carry out the rescue. Shipowner Cai and Datong Company Manager Liu also boarded the ship. When they arrived, they saw black smoke billowing from the liner, and the front part of the hull had been damaged. When they asked the guards about the cause of the fire, they claimed they did not know. Therefore, the Songpu Maru immediately returned to Dalian. This is a general account of the Chinese Merchants Insurance Company's rescue efforts. As for the shipowner, it is said that he had sent eight crew members, including Feng Lian Zun, Feng Lian Rong, Qu Jinshi, Wang Futian, and Song Futian, from Longkou to the stranded ship to retrieve the cargo. Before the 24th, they had removed most of the flour and machine oil. On the evening of the 24th, the rear cabin of the liner suddenly caught fire for some reason. Because the machine oil was extremely flammable, it burned the Datong Company's specially dispatched crew member Feng Lian Rong to death. After this incident occurred, all parties involved kept it a secret. The town mayor of Sang Island also kept it a secret. Feng Lian Rong's wife, because her husband's death was unclear, held a knife and went to the Datong Company to demand compensation from the manager, saying that if she did not receive compensation, she would kill herself. Later, the company agreed to pay her an annual pension of 240 yuan for 30 years, and the matter was settled. Furthermore, the town mayor of Sang Island, Li, was also accused by the town's citizens to the Huang County government and has been detained. He has not yet been released.</p>

<p>Security Corps Head Takes Office: The county's Security Committee was organized and established according to the law long ago. The County Magistrate serves as the Chief Commander, and the Civil Affairs Department approved the appointment of Wu Changding as the Head of the Corps. The County Committee appointed this Corps Head concurrently as the Director of the Committee. It is now known that the Director arrived in the county yesterday and paid a visit to County Magistrate Shen. Several rooms were allocated in the County Government to establish an office. Operations will commence immediately. The monthly expenses are 250 silver dollars, allocated from local funding.</p>
<p>Abolishing the Cooperative Guidance Office: The affairs of the Cooperative Guidance Office in the county were originally quite simple. The monthly expenditure was over 400 silver dollars. The Department of Industry believes that during this time of tight government spending, the office is a redundant organization and too uneconomical. It should be abolished and taken over by the county. The County Magistrate will direct the affairs of the office. The Department of Industry will separately appoint the original staff members Ding Zhenyl, Zhu Minzheng, and Jiang Chaoyang to report to the County Magistrate from July 1, 21st year of the Republic, to assist with all matters. The office is currently handling its closure to facilitate the handover after receiving the order.</p>
<p>Education Bureau Reorganizes the Tax Collection Office: After taking office, the Director of the Education Bureau, Zhu Zhaosheng, first completed the reorganization of the bureau's aspects. The attached Tax Collection Office manages over 3,000 shih of field rent, plus another 2,000+ shih entrusted for collection by private warehouses, making the situation complex and difficult to reorganize. It is heard that Director Zhu, in light of the malfeasance of the Fengxian County Tax Collection Office last year, and the fact that over 5,000 silver dollars of warehouse rent from last year were deposited in the Songjiang Bank under private names and lost entirely, urgently needs to find a way to reorganize and rectify the situation. It is now known that he has ordered the original staff of the Tax Collection Office to quickly wrap up matters and is preparing a reorganization plan to be implemented, and has appointed a Mr. Chen to supervise and expedite the conclusion.</p>

<p>Another Request to Exempt Housing Rent: The Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association of the county, Qiu Shaoxian, Dai Yi, and over 240 others, believe that the Provincial Government disregards the people's hardship and has failed to effectively reduce or exempt housing rent. They have sent another telegram to the Provincial Government requesting an exemption. The telegram reads: Qingpu County has suffered terrible disasters, and the people's economy is in dire straits. If housing rent is levied again, the people will not be able to bear it. We implore you to consider the disaster victims and grant an exemption to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

<p>The Tragic Murder Case at the Border of Wu and Cheng: At Jiangjiatou, a few miles from Dongqing Town, on the border of Wu and Cheng, there was a farmer named Jiang Jufa, who was wealthy. He had no children of his own, so he adopted a child with the Xue surname, Tianzhen, as an adopted son. Later, he found a wife for him. Unexpectedly, a relationship developed between the father-in-law and daughter-in-law. Tianzhen also had an older brother who occasionally came to Jiang's house. Somehow, he also had an affair with his sister-in-law. They both saw Tianzhen as a thorn in their side. Last winter, they conspired to first blind Tianzhen by cutting out his eyes, then cruelly murdered him and cut his body into three pieces. They hired someone to bury him in a mulberry field at Xuejiatou, promising to pay the burial party 200 silver dollars. This money was never paid, and the secret was leaked. Recently, the police team stationed in Xingcun went to the burial site and exhumed the body. The first layer was soil, the second layer was straw, the third layer was lime, and the fourth layer was a large stone slab. Only in the fifth layer was the body found, in a horrifying state. It is heard that Jiang Jufa's wife and one of the burial party have been arrested and will be sent to the county for interrogation soon.</p>

Yang Guangchong's motive for the murder was resentment that his uncle had investigated the embezzlement of 2,000 yuan. He discussed the matter with Li Rentang and Cai Changyuan. Li and Cai initially refused, but Yang Guangchong wrote a note and gave it to the two, stating that he alone would be responsible for any incidents in the future. Unexpectedly, the note was found by Yang Boheng's son, Yang Guangyu, leading to the breaking of the case. The murderer and his accomplices Li and Cai have all confessed without denial. The examination procedures have been completed, and a sentence will be announced soon.</p>

<p>Swallowing the Ticket Money and Being Killed by Bandits: The son of Deng Guobao, a farmer near Wangying Town in the county, who is twelve years old and has the milk name "Dagouzi", was suddenly kidnapped by bandits last month. Deng, who is already in his sixties and has only this one son, raised 500 silver dollars and asked Wu Huishu, a watchman in the town, to contact the bandits. Unexpectedly, Wu only used 200 silver dollars to redeem Deng's son. After the bandits found out, they bombed Wu's gate open at dawn the other day. Wu Huishu was lying in bed at the time. The bandits fired three shots at him, hitting him in vital points, killing him instantly. The bandits then fled with a shout.</p>
<p>Bandits Injure People in Wangying Town: Six bandits armed with guns and weapons suddenly broke into the home of carpenter Guo Zhaozhang in Wangying Town the other night. Guo's eldest son escaped through the back door and reported to the police team stationed in the town. The team arrived to arrest the bandits, who fled upon hearing the news. Unexpectedly, the bandits returned the next night, declaring, "You reported to the police team. Today, we'll give you some suffering to see how you like it." After saying this, they tied up Guo's entire family and burned them with fire. The bandits then rushed into the bedroom and searched extensively, only finding thirty or forty silver dollars. Unsatisfied, the bandits ordered Guo Zhaozhang to raise several thousand silver dollars within ten days, or else they would set fire to the place and kill them all. Guo has now reported the case in the city and has gone to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Bandits Rampant in Xin, Sheng, and Fenghua Counties: The three counties of Xin, Sheng, and Fenghua have always been known for having many bandits, and their numbers have been increasing in recent years. They have recently become even more rampant. The bandits in the three counties were originally led by Sun Libiao. Since Sun was captured and executed, there has been no one in charge. The bandit gangs in the three counties have elected Sun Qingbiao, Wang Jinlong, Chen Guojun, Chen Guoxin, Weng Laoer, and Weng Laosan as their leaders, calling them the Six Heavenly Kings. They have a total of over 300 bandits. Their main bases are all in the deep mountains. All the villages in Fenghua, such as Zuoxikeng, Huikeng Village, Yankengtang, Tian Yujiakeng, and the junction of Xin and Sheng, such as Feishubankeng, Dongkeng, Ruokeng, and Panjiashan, are now occupied by the bandits. The bandits in the occupied villages not only collect food and provide wine and meat, but also do not rob or kill. It is now said that the bandits, because their lives are boring, have organized a women's entertainment team. It is also said that many shameless women have voluntarily entered the bandit dens. It is also heard that the bandits' loot is not enough to meet their needs, so they are levying land taxes in the bandit areas. All land within the bandit areas must first pay a certain amount of tax before it can be cultivated. The rampancy of the bandits can be seen.</p>

<p>The Major Case in Ju Lane Solved: The major case in Ju Lane, Shaoxing City, in which the entire family of Xia Changyan's mother, wives, concubines, and maids were tragically murdered four years ago, has not been solved for several years. The court recently investigated the Ju Lane murder case, which had not been solved for many years, due to the trial of a divorce case. The old matter was brought up again, and Yuezhong was once again in an uproar. On the day the case occurred, someone went to investigate and found a small wine jar outside the door with fresh damage. According to the person in charge of the matter, it contained gold bars and silver dollars hidden under the bed in the room. The person who knew about the hidden gold was Xia Changyan's former concubine, Zhou Meiying. She later left due to resentment and was not without suspicion. Although she was interrogated, she was released without obtaining any useful information. However, Zhou Meiying's older brother, Zhou Changyou, disappeared immediately after the incident, making him a major suspect in the case. An arrest warrant was issued, but it was never cancelled. After Zhou fled, he neither supported his wife and daughters nor provided any information. His wife, Mo Fenggu, had no choice but to work as a servant. She went to Shanghai and returned to Shaoxing this year after four years. She and Zhou Changyou's mother proposed a divorce, but they ended up in litigation due to disagreement on the conditions. The court opened the trial at 2 PM on the 22nd. Both plaintiffs and defendants arrived on time. Zhou Changyou's sister, Zhou Meiying, also accompanied a young female friend to the court to listen to the proceedings. Yang Shoutu, the bailiff who had previously been sent to arrest Zhou Changyou, saw her and reported it to the prosecutor's office. After the civil court divorce case was concluded, Li Su, a judge from the criminal court, interrogated Zhou Changyou. According to his confession, the murders were committed by Zhang Qingbiao, Lai Shihuang, and others, and had nothing to do with him. He fled because he was suspected of being involved in the murder case. The court, believing that there were clues in the case, sent Zhou to prison for further investigation. It was discovered that Zhang Qingbiao, whom Zhou mentioned, was the former deputy captain of the detectives and had been shot to death due to another matter. Lai Shihuang was Zhang Zongyao, who was killed and dismembered last year behind Fushan.</p>

<p>Must Discuss with Wang Zhengting Before Deciding</p>
<p>Achievement Can Be Hoped for if Funds Can Be Raised</p>
<p>After the news that the puppet state was planning to send Liu Changchun and Yu Xiwei to the World Games, it aroused considerable attention from the sports community in North China. There was a saying that our country should send Yu and Liu to attend to suppress the ambitions of the puppet state. This matter is very strong in North China. Hao Gengsheng, the former director of physical education at Northeastern University, once discussed it with Dr. Zhang Boling, the president of the China National Sports Association, planning to raise funds in North China to send Yu and Liu to the United States. However, it still needs to be decided after Dr. Wang Zhengting, the chairman of the National Sports Association, goes to Ping to discuss it. Yesterday, Hao Gengsheng telegraphed Mr. Shen Siliang in this port, asking him to delay his trip and sail together with Yu and Liu on the same day. Shen had already contacted the United States and completed the arrangements for the ship tickets and other matters, so it was inconvenient to postpone it. Therefore, he sailed as scheduled yesterday. If funds can be raised for this matter and registration can be made, it is still possible to catch up, and we will see if it can become a reality.</p>

<p>Yesterday, according to Li Baojun, the manager of the China Tennis Team, the China National Sports Association plans to host the National Tennis Tournament this year to determine the ranking of Chinese tennis players. Ranking is the so-called top ten tennis players. This type of competition is prevalent in various countries around the world, but in our country, with its immature level, there has never been such a move. Now, the Sports Association is initiating this ranking competition in order to promote technology and increase interest. It is now planned to invite tennis players from Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, Nanjing, and other places to compete in Shanghai. Any good players who do not participate will lose their ranking in the country. As for the competition date, it has not yet been determined. It is also said that Qiu Feihai will not be able to arrive in Shanghai until August 20th.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Chinese Win Over Lax in Lawn Tennis League <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Winning Score: Three Matches to Two, Total Points Eight to Seven</p>
<p>丨Chinese Team Lineup Had Errors丨</p>
<p>French Businessmen Beat Northern Lawn Nine to Six</p>
<p>In the first week of the lawn tennis league, the Chinese Tennis Club played against Lax (commonly known as Southern Lawn). The makeup match was held yesterday afternoon at the Chinese tennis court, and the spectators were very enthusiastic. Due to errors in the Chinese team's lineup strategy, they only won by a narrow margin of eight to seven in total points. In terms of matches won, the score was three to two. Considering the strength of the two teams, the Chinese team should have won by at least twelve to three. Losing four points was truly regrettable. Furthermore, the first team, Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia, failed to win a clean sweep of three to zero, losing one point unexpectedly. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Lin and Zheng's Performance Less Impressive: The first team, Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia, played against A.V. White and Harveys. The score was four to six, six to three, and six to four. Considering Lin and Zheng's reputation as Shanghai doubles champions, it was unexpected that they would lose a match. Their performance was particularly lackluster. Zheng Zhaojia appeared timid, and Lin Baohua lacked confidence. They committed many unforced errors, and brilliant plays were scarce.</p>
<p>Yu and Jiang Win Three Straight: The second team, Jiang Daozhang and Yu Tianguang, played against Meng and. Yu and Jiang won all three matches, with scores of six to one, six to three, and eight to six. However, their coordination was also not ideal. Yu Tianguang was cautious, while Jiang Daozhang appeared weak. The experience of the older player overshadowed the younger player.</p>
<p>Tu and Wu Fail to Cooperate: The third team, Tu Kaiyuan, is skilled in doubles, and Wu Zhuren is also considered strong. However, Wu is calm, while Tu is impetuous, making it fundamentally difficult for them to cooperate. Initially, their performance was quite good, with occasional brilliant plays. Later, Tu often became agitated, and his shots were frequently unsuccessful. Moreover, he often complained, causing the team's performance to deteriorate. Their opponents were the renowned Whit and A.A. White. The fact that Whit was relegated to the third team shows their strategic cunning. It seemed difficult for Tu and Wu to win. If they could have maintained the steady state from the beginning, they might have been able to win a point. However, the Chinese team ultimately lost with scores of four to six and four to six.</p>
<p>Qian and Liang Even Less Impressive: Qian Yaobin and Liang Deguang paired up in the fourth team. When Liang teamed up with Guo Qida on Wednesday, their performance was quite good. Yesterday, partnering with Qian, he appeared noticeably inferior. This was because Liang is a conservative player, while Qian is an impatient player. Furthermore, Qian had just arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and had not had much practice, so his skills were rusty and his performance was mediocre. If Shen Meizhen or Liu Keng had partnered with Wu, they would not have lost three straight. In this match, Lax's McShee and Komeny won three straight with scores of six to four, seven to five, and six to three.</p>
<p>Feng and Guo's Prowess Undiminished: Feng Xikang and Guo Qida, each with over ten years of experience, performed exceptionally well in the fifth team, establishing a remarkable feat. They were the best performers of the five teams yesterday and also the first to finish. Their contributions were invaluable. They defeated Howard and Allen with scores of six to one, six to one, and eight to six. In the third set, their opponents had a five to one lead, giving them a strong advantage and the potential to win a point. However, Feng and Guo remained calm as usual. They did not become careless despite their slim hopes, and they remained cautious and methodical, gradually progressing. They were ultimately able to turn the tide and reverse the defeat, which was truly not easy.</p>
<p>French Businessmen Beat Northern Lawn: On Thursday, the French Businessmen's Association played a makeup match against Northern Lawn in the first week of the league. The result was a nine to six victory for the French team. The French team is quite strong, while Northern Lawn had a full complement of players that day, resulting in many brilliant plays. This was quite different from their previous match against the Chinese team, where they lost fifteen to zero. The results are as follows: (1) Balanshe and Mayas (French) beat Mengsaier Smith and Robson (Northern) six to four, six to three, and nine to six. (2) Klenov and Kuhlmann (French) beat Nash and Corcho (Northern) six to four, six to eight, and eight to six. (3) Little Tabers and Fang En (French) beat Forbes and Gottingen (Northern) twelve to ten, six to two, and four to six. (4) Corton and Woolley (Northern) beat Trajessière and Hunter (French) six to one and six to four. (5) Frut and Glant (French) beat Pitt and Rabot (Northern) ten to eight, six to three, and seven to nine.</p>

However, as it is Saturday and the office is closed in the afternoon, those wishing to register for the competition should go to No. 710, Xianyi Lane, Chongqing Road in the afternoon to contact Mr. Lu. It is hoped that other associations will actively participate.</p>

<p>I said... "For children this old, it's fine as long as someone is there to play with them. It should be doable. I think I can sum up Mr. Sheng's argument in two sentences. I don't know if I'm right. Those two sentences are... 'We welcome all who come, and we'll deliver it to the door of those who don't come.'"</p>
<p>"Children in the countryside, when they get a little older, have to tend cattle and chop firewood, so even if they want to come, they can't. And those little babies in arms can't be accepted even if they come. For these, we have no choice but to deliver education to their door. But for children like Qiaogu, three to five years old, we might as well open the door wide and say, 'We welcome all who come.' Because if they're not at home, there's less trouble at home. And if they enter school, the school won't be too burdened. I admit that Mr. Sheng has discovered a new continent today. But savoring Mr. Sheng's tone, it seems that the kindergartens in the city are not quite where they should be. I don't know if I'm guessing wrong?" Mr. Zhu said, "You're right! Let me tell you an interesting story. I heard this story indirectly, but it's absolutely true, not a joke. A young mistress loved to play mahjong more than anything else. She loved playing mahjong more than her child, who was a little angel, very cute. But spoiled from a young age, she inevitably threw tantrums sometimes. When this young mistress was engrossed in playing mahjong, her child would often come to bother her. One moment she wanted candy, the next she wanted wontons, one moment she was shouting to be scratched, the next she was shouting to pee, making the young mistress unable to settle down. She said to her child, 'If you keep bothering me like this, I'll send you to kindergarten.' The child didn't understand anything, and day by day she became a thorn in her mother's side. In the end, she hardened her heart and sent the child to kindergarten. Returning to the mahjong chair, she said with a grin, 'The little thing isn't here. Today I can play a few rounds to my heart's content.' Zhong'er! The teachers in the city's kindergartens have become the nannies of the young mistresses, helping them take care of their children so they can gamble without worry. See how the cause of education has become so absurd. When kindergartens go to the countryside, they immediately help rural women with production. Isn't that how it should be! I want to add one more thing: kindergartens set up next to yarn factories and silk factories in the city are the same kind of meaningful thing. It's a pity that those Miss-like kindergarten teachers seem to be willingly serving as the nannies of young mistresses and can't break free. This is truly perplexing. Who will do the work of clearing the wilderness on these new continents?" I said, "Of course, we'll do it ourselves!"</p>

<p>Collins, the Englishman who defeated Kohan, was still defeated by Sato of Japan, six to four, six to four, six to two.

Andre won the first two sets. At the beginning of the third set, he unfortunately suffered a sprained ankle and fell to the ground. After being helped up and massaged, he continued the game, abandoning the third set. In the fourth set, Andre had a five to four lead. Twice, he only needed to win two more points to win the entire match. In the end, he failed because he could not run. Shields won with four to six, thirteen to fifteen, six to three, seven to five, and six to two. The match lasted two hours and forty-five minutes.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Buying Firecrackers and Setting Them Off Yourself <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>My advocacy of democracy comes from practical experience. I believe that the purpose of politics is to seek the welfare of the people. To seek the welfare of the people, there must be a solidified relationship between the people and the land. The people and the land are born here and gather here; therefore, politics is nothing more than the words "birth" and "gathering." To enable the people to be born and to gather, they must be able to defend themselves and their land.</p>
<p>Why must the people protect themselves? Because only they know their own pain most thoroughly.</p>
<p>Why should the people defend their land? Because the land belongs to the people. Only when they own something do they know how to cherish it.</p>
<p>Why should local people manage local affairs? Because local people managing local affairs is like managing their own personal affairs. Managing one's own personal affairs is always done carefully and with a sense of responsibility; managing other people's affairs! You can be careless and not put in the effort.</p>
<p>I believe that the tools of politics are nothing more than two things: one is funding, and the other is talent, both of which must be drawn from the people. Since politics is for the people, it should be taken from the people and used for the people. However, it is not enough to just take from the people and use for the people; the people must take for themselves and use for themselves.</p>
<p>In conclusion, everyone is willing to buy firecrackers and set them off themselves; if you buy firecrackers and let someone else set them off, even a five-year-old will complain. This is the essence of democracy.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Anecdotes About Yu Hu <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Old Yu's impeachment of Wang Zhengyou was a sound that shook the universe. A guest talked about his anecdotes, saying that Yu Youren and Hu Puan were both famous for their beautiful beards, so they were nicknamed Yu Hu. He used to be a news reporter and was also upright and outspoken. He once presided over the "Min Hu Bao" (People's Call) newspaper, advocating revolution. He was hated by the Qing court. A certain high official especially hated him to the bone, saying, "If I catch Yu, I will gouge out his eyes as punishment." Yu knew this and laughed it off, jokingly changing the "Min Hu Bao" (People's Call) to "Min Yu Bao" (People's Appeal). Removing the two dots from the character "呼" (hu, call) to make it "吁" (yu, appeal) is no different from a person having their eyes gouged out. His humor was like this. Old Yu was good at cooking mutton, having been taught by Mongolians. He had names like Genghis Khan Mutton and Caucasian Mutton, which were rich but not gamey, thick but not greasy, and were a special delicacy. The guest had once been full at Yu's house and praised it endlessly. Yu loved to eat pike lung. The pike is a fish with a swollen belly like a pufferfish, found in lakes and marshes. Its lungs are extremely tender. Cooking them into a soup is a fine delicacy. The Shi Family Restaurant in Xiangxi, Wu is especially good at making it. Old Yu would often quickly eat it when he was visiting Lingyan Temple. The character "魞" (pike) is not found in dictionaries, so he repeatedly examined and corrected it, and even wrote poems to promote it. On ordinary days, he wears green shoes and cloth socks, without a speck of dust. When he has time, he approaches the pond, his strength and unrestrainedness having an ancient charm. He also likes to write about recent works. I saw a vertical scroll he wrote at a friend's house, recording one of the miscellaneous poems of Hai Yu, which said: "Fallen leaves pile up silently, layer upon layer. In the empty mountain, the old man can still walk. I have idly traveled all the ancient temples in Jiangnan. I can also be counted as a wild monk from the West." Among politicians, Old Yu is worthy of the name of an elegant man without shame. He is truly admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Record of Students and Volunteers Departing for the Northeast <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>Last year, when Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang were lost, more than 8,000 students and volunteers rose up in indignation in a corner of Songbin. By the time of the Shanghai Incident, fewer than 100 people ventured into the hail of bullets, disregarding their mortal bodies. I secretly think that there is a world of difference between sitting and talking and getting up and doing. Now, in addition to a part incorporated into the 19th Route Army Volunteers, I heard that only ten remained. These are the ten determined men who vowed not to change their minds, that is, the students and volunteers who the newspapers reported recently were about to depart for the Northeast. Yesterday, I met Mr. Zhang Wenzhong, a member of the regiment, who made the following remarks to the reporter. He said that since the puppet Manchukuo and the Japanese have already made a decision to recognize it, there is no other way to recover the lost land in the Northeast and rescue our compatriots in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang other than by force. The Volunteer Army in the Northeast, numbering a million, lacks unified rule. If this continues, it is not the ultimate goal of long-term resistance. My comrades will go to the Northeast, without empty talk and high-sounding words, with the duty of uniting the volunteer army in the two provinces. My comrades have their own strengths and cooperate with each other, such as those who speak Japanese, who scout out the enemy's reality, and those who know the customs of the Northeast, who specialize in contacting all the patriots in the Northeast. Others who are proficient in both Chinese and English engage in internal and external propaganda work. They will complete their mission by meeting General Ma Zhanshan. As for the route out of the customs, they have also done their best in advance. If they go directly to Dalian, Vladivostok, etc., they will inevitably be spotted by the Japanese and their journey will be blocked. It has now been determined to go to Beiping first, turn to Rehe, and then exit Xifengkou. They are not afraid of the hardships of the mountains and rivers. They will break through the difficulties with a passionate heart.</p>
<p>I heard that the day the regiment's flag was headed north was this month. The 19th Route Army had a precedent telegram directly to Ma Zhanshan. Generals Cai Tingkai and Weng Zhaoyuan had personal letters of recommendation. When visiting Zhu Qinglan in Shanghai, they expressed their appreciation. When visiting Ma Zhanshan's representative, they also welcomed them sincerely. The gentlemen of the regiment were all students from the Middle School, Political Science, Zhengfeng College, Wen College, and Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School in this port. The authorities of each school praised the gentlemen for their patriotic indignation to save the country, kept their grades, and subsidized their travel expenses, in order to boost their morale. Zhang Wenzhong, who spoke with the reporter, had studied at Zhengfeng Wen College. When the Shanghai war broke out, he served as a war reporter for a news agency and also engaged in scouting. Miss Yao, of Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, is the niece of Yao Zirang, a famous person in Shanghai. She had taught in the Northeast. When she traveled to the Northeast, she served in the Volunteer Army twice, riding a horse and holding a gun, charging into battle. Mulan and Chonggu cannot be surpassed in front. Miss Yao returned to the south not long ago, and then vowed to abandon the pen and join the army, which is also magnificent.</p>
<h3 id="e144">A Record of the First Trial of Sound <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Hao</p>
<p>The long-awaited sound and color film "A Laughing Fate" by Mingxing Company has recently been completed. The first episode was premiered at the Nanjing Grand Theater in this port on the morning of the previous day. At that time, the wind and rain were rushing in a fierce manner. The audience rushed to stop, their clothes and shoes were wet, but they did not think it was bitter. After the screening, they praised it endlessly.</p>
<p>On this day, the bell rang ten times. The music started and the silver light suddenly appeared. The main characters in the play, Ms. Hu Die, who plays both Shen Fengxi and He Lina, Xia Peizhen plays Guan Xiugu, Zheng Xiaoqiu plays Fan Jiashu, and Xiao Ying plays Guan Shoufeng, all act in a true and vivid manner, depicting the characters meticulously. Their voices, smiles, manners, and expressions are all very similar to the characters in the book. For a time, people were intoxicated by the silver light, as if reliving old dreams and reuniting with old friends. The original impressions of Mr. Zhang Henshui's original work are very deep in everyone's minds. The performing art of this film has reached a perfect state.</p>
<p>The plot of the whole film starts with Jiashu wandering around Tianqiao and ends with Fengxi moving away. The story told is very plain. It is completely based on subtle expressions and genuine emotions. Among them, Jiashu and Shoufeng meet by chance, their hearts are touched by a word, and they quickly become intimate friends. Shoufeng is poor and sick, and a hero at the end of the road, his eyes are full of hot tears. When Fengxi hears Jiashu's words to abandon her studies, she is as if in a dream, and she can't help but cry with joy, and the shy, coquettish expression when she privately sends a photo, and the earnestness of her words when asking for a photo, etc., can always manipulate the audience's emotions of sorrow and joy unconsciously. This is a very valuable point. In addition, the lipstick mark left by Jiashu on the stage, the deep concealment of the curtains in Fengxi's boudoir, and Lina's repeated hints and efforts to show her love, are all extremely beautiful. This is a master of writing love.</p>
<p>The script is tightly and appropriately divided into scenes, interspersed with three different kinds of love, circling back and forth, and the descriptions are very elegant. It can be seen that Mr. Duhe has worked hard to cut and compile it. The words in the silent parts and the lines in the sound dialogues are all forceful and full of emotion. The excerpts are wonderful and unprecedented. The sound is very clear. The scenery is taken from many scenic spots in the old capital, and most of them are natural color films. The continuous projection on the white screen is bright and pleasing to the eye, no different from lying down and traveling. The overall performance of the play is excellent and can be called a masterpiece. It is said that the second episode will also be released soon, and it is expected to have new contributions.</p>
<p>Brief News: Mr. Huang Yizhao, a one-finger Zen Tuina doctor at No. 2, Lane 21, South Chengdu Road, this port, has inherited his family's knowledge. Over the years, he has cured countless serious diseases of various internal and external departments. He never borrows heavy drugs. However, in the field of trauma, in addition to Tuina, he still needs to ask for drugs. He accepted the commission of Mr. Chen Zhipu and managed Chen's Trauma Golden Pill. The pill is a secret recipe from Chen's family, and its medicinal properties are kingly, and its effectiveness is rapid. It can cure both new and old injuries. It is said that Chen's ambition is to help the world, and the price is very cheap.</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The government's recent statement: "If the Communists can join the nation in overcoming difficulties, the government can abandon its policy of suppressing the Communists and shift all its efforts to recovering lost territory." Judging from the current situation, this is indeed a very thorough view. Facts prove that the main cause of the spread of Communist disaster is the years of natural and man-made disasters, which only destroy and do not build, leading to the people being unable to bear their lives and forcing a huge chaos; in the future, if internal affairs can be reformed and people's livelihoods can be supported, political means can be used to solve it, so why bother with a large army to suppress it? If the large army is moved out of the customs to support the volunteer army, not only can the lost territory be recovered, but it can also calm the people's anger, revitalize the national soul, consolidate domestic peace, and improve international status. Why would the authorities not be happy to do so?</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek recently exhorted the commanders of the anti-communist forces with the six words "hard work, quick work, practical work." I would like to exhort Chiang to use this to defeat the rebels, restore the Northeast, and build an immortal career!</p>

<p>— Shanshan</p>
<p>(I) Farewell to West Lake</p>
<p>As the eastern sky just began to reveal a faint fish-belly white, I had already, together with the well-wishers—the second batch of patients who had not slept well that night—strolled swiftly past the desolate and mournful Tomb of Su Xiaoxiao, stepping onto the humorous yet slender Bai Causeway, heading towards the bustling corner of Hangzhou. The well-wishers advised me to take a car, but I strongly opposed it, because I wanted to take one last look at the scenery of the West Lake and mountains that I was about to leave behind. Although the night rain had stopped, the cotton-like damp clouds still heavily pressed on the tops of the mountains. The lake was shrouded in a light mist like silver gauze, and the lake water was still. At this time, there were no boats, nor could one hear the tinkling of shoe heels. I slowed my pace and quietly strode forward. Amidst the cries of "Poria Cake, Crystal Cake", I boarded the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Bureau's bus bound for Nanjing. At just after six o'clock, I heard the last cry, a tragic and piercing call that seemed to determine my fate. At that moment, the bus had already started, and I simultaneously gave the last strand of my gaze to West Lake.</p>
<p>(II) Bamboo Path</p>
<p>The car had just passed the lakeside and turned a corner when it stopped outside a repair shop. Several workers began to repair the machinery. The passengers all stared at the workers' hands, their brows furrowed, seemingly impatient. I couldn't help but let out a sigh of helplessness. I thought to myself, "We Chinese people always embrace the Buddha's feet only at the last minute. The bus stops for repairs even as it is about to start."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the workers were quick. After only half an hour of repairs, the vehicle was able to drive smoothly again. The low pressure among the passengers also disappeared, and everyone looked very lively, especially their two flexible eyes.</p>
<p>The journey was smooth all the way. Before long, the vehicle drove onto the bamboo path between "Dong (Dong)" and "Shangbai (Shangbai)". This bamboo path, I am not exaggerating when I say, is at least six or seven li long. Both sides of the intoxicated red soil mountain road were densely lined with bamboo. The new green leaves were layered and piled up into a delicate green sea. Countless bamboo poles flickered with the speed of the car. These flickering, countless bamboo poles seemed like a flock of cranes dancing, or a hundred thousand ostriches racing.</p>
<p>(III) Miniature of the Three Gorges</p>
<p>The car galloped through the mountains, like an invincible beast walking on a familiar road every day, without hesitation or stagnation, sweeping across the red, eye-catching mountain trails like a gust of wind.</p>
<p>After passing Qingshan, the car climbed a hillside with great effort. At this time, steep cliffs stood on both sides of the road. These cliffs were so high that the sky was squeezed small. If the cliffs were a miniature of the mountains, and the car road was the vast Yangtze River, then isn't this a small model of the Three Gorges of Badong?</p>
<p>(IV) A Beautiful Painting</p>
<p>The passengers' eyes were all fixed on the window, without a word. Directly in front of me was a rectangular window. It was very interesting to look out from this rectangular window. Sometimes, one could see a corner of green hills peeking out from the pine forest. Sometimes, one could see a few figures moving on the red soil road sandwiched between the bright green of midsummer. The frame of this window was just like the frame of a painting. What was framed in the middle was the most beautiful corner of nature, a beautiful painting. But even if it is a beautiful painting, it can't change with the speed of the wheels like this landscape.</p>

<p>Chapter 11: An Official Parade in a Remote Town; A Group of Vulgar People Follow the Retinue</p>
<p>As they just entered the west gate of the county town, they had already alarmed the crowds in the city. Many men, women, old, and young gathered on both sides of the street, standing as if in a welcoming line, craning their necks to watch. It felt even more interesting than watching the City God go on parade. As they watched, the crowd even whispered to each other, exchanging private words. They corroborated their keen and accurate judgments. Those sitting in the two mule carts must be two high-ranking officials. They must be the big shots in this entourage. But there can't be two heads of equal status, so they guessed that it must be one civilian official and one military official, or one chief official and one deputy official. It was just a fleeting glimpse, and they couldn't clearly see the appearance of the two high-ranking officials. They couldn't rely on their smattering of knowledge of physiognomy to carefully assess who had better fortune and higher rank. They wanted to see how the future would turn out, like placing a bet, which was still a little regrettable. However, there was another place where they could confidently and accurately guess. They must be going to the Changxing Grand Hotel to rest their horses. This was what everyone believed, without any doubt. Because although there were many hotels in the city, there was really only one, the Changxing Grand Hotel, that was the best and largest in terms of layout and facilities. Traditionally, officials arriving from the provincial capital could not stoop to stay in small inns. Since the establishment of the Changxing Grand Hotel, it had monopolized all such official residences. This can be considered a common sense known to everyone in the area. There was no need for further discussion. Moreover, there was a special discovery in this entourage. The fat man at the very front, who looked like a judge riding a horse in a City God parade, was recognized by many as the most famous gentleman in the area. His official title and nickname were called Qiu Si Yanwang (Fourth Lord Qiu, the King of Hell), Qiu Jinlu, or Fourth Master Qiu. He always accompanied the county magistrate in and out of the county government, addressing the county magistrate as a brother, and sitting on an equal footing. He specialized in secretly arranging lawsuits for the elders of the village, fulfilling every request. Usually, if someone wanted to find him, there were only three places where they could find his traces. The first was the county government. The second was the small family he had established with a newlywed courtesan. The third was the Changxing Grand Hotel, where officials came and went. He had a room reserved there all year round, specifically for handling cases and discussing litigation, as if it were a law firm. Now, with his high status, he did not hesitate to lower himself to ride a horse for these two newly arrived high officials. It was conceivable that the status and influence of these two high officials were absolutely extraordinary.</p>

<p>The Cotton Yarn Market Initially Fell and Then Rose, With an Unusually Chaotic Situation. The Continued Decline in Prices Led to Large Merchants Covering Short Positions, Resulting in a Sudden Reaction and Rise. This Kind of Situation Is a Common Phenomenon. Moreover, the Price Has Fallen by 16 or 17 Taels From the Peak. It Would Not Be Surprising If It Returned to 3, 5, or 2 Taels. However, in Reality, There Is Still Not Much Optimism. Due to the Weakness of Rural Areas, Economic Bankruptcy, and the Weak Purchasing Power of Various Parties, Coupled with the Fierce Competition From Japanese Merchants, the Future Depends on Actual Facts as the Biggest Key.</p>
<p>The Human Standard Improved After the Decline: The Early Market for the Human Standard Opened. With the American Cotton Market Being Average, There Was a Lack of Buyers in the Market. Many Spread Out and Closed Positions, With Each Month Falling by 1, 1, and 2 Qian. In the Afternoon, There Were Rumors in the Market That Yarn Manufacturers Were Convening Meetings and There Was Talk of Reducing Labor. As a Result, the Buying Trend Became More Intense. Each Month Rose Step by Step, With the Near Month Rising by 1, 2, and 7 Qian, and the Distant Month Rising by 2, 2, and 3 Qian. The Total Transaction Statistics for the Day Were 30,700 Bales.

<p>The cotton market remains calm, but the buying interest is strong. Due to rising gold prices, sentiment is firm, and buyers are eager to increase their positions. However, factory demand is stagnant as factories already have enough foreign cotton. There is no capacity for domestic cotton. It is said that 400,000 to 600,000 bales of American cotton may be sold to our country on credit, and both parties have reached a compromise on the terms and procedures. If this becomes a reality, it will have a significant impact on domestic cotton. Therefore, in the afternoon, Sincere and major players dumped large quantities. However, general retail cotton merchants were buying, holding onto their holdings, due to rising margins. In short, given the overall situation, it is difficult to predict the future.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Fluctuations are Minimal. The Zheng Standard market opened with American cotton weak, and there were few buyers in the market. Prices fell by 1.5 cash for each month. The afternoon opening was very weak, and major players were selling, softening the market. The closing price rose by 1.2 cash due to the better gold market. The total trading volume for the day was 53,500 dan. Sales included Changfeng 3,500 dan, Sincere 5,200 dan, and Changhe 2,000 dan. Purchases included Suilong 1,500 dan, Rongxing 1,400 dan, Renfeng 1,500 dan, and Gengfeng 1,200 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>August 2850 ··· 101.500 Total 465.20</p>
<p>Factory Appetite Completely Blocked. Spot cotton consumption is sluggish, and factory demand has completely stopped.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially stable due to good weather and short covering. Later, it weakened again due to favorable weather. Futures rose by 2 to 3 points, spot remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by 4 to 5 points, spot rose by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 5 points. Indian cotton market closed.

<p>Also, the American-An Cotton Firm in this port received a telegram from New York on the 23rd of this month, saying that the market has limited business, speculators are quiet, those with goods on hand are selling very little, demand is not strong, and the basis price is slightly loose. Piece goods trade is sluggish, and domestic textile mills are still reducing work. There are many reports about fruit and silkworm pests, but they may be exaggerated. The climate is better than before.</p>

<p>Wenzhou Ke Xian Arrives</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market still showed no improvement. Because the customer traffic was very sluggish, the unified market only had Wuxi gangs handling more than 1,000 bags of small glutinous rice. Other customers did not inquire. The local appetite was flat. In addition to 1,000 bags of small glutinous rice, only 100 bags of red large glutinous rice arrived. Temporary shortage, remaining stock is still sufficient. However, as the early rice of Ke Xian is approaching the market, those in the producing areas with ample old rice have the intention of shipping it to the market. Yesterday, another 400 bags of Wenzhou Ke Xian arrived. It is expected to arrive steadily in the future. In this flat market, it is not easy to expect a good market situation.

<h3 id="e164">Northeast Customs Seized Meilehe's Remarks <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Fukumoto Violates Laws</p>
<p>Has Been Dismissed by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Reuters Shanghai News, Chinese Customs Commissioner Meilehe, yesterday issued the following remarks on the Northeast Customs issue: "Manchukuo" authorities, originally the restrictions imposed on the remittance of tax funds to Shanghai, and the recent robbery of this revenue, have been used to pay off indemnities and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties, greatly diminishing. Now that all kinds of commerce are seeing depression, resulting in shrinking tax revenue, the Northeast Customs problem, if prolonged, will greatly affect the obligation to repay indemnities and foreign debts, and domestic debts dependent on customs revenue will also face the same danger. The financial situation has been further worsened by the extraordinary actions of Fukumoto, the Dalian Customs Commissioner. Fukumoto, a Japanese, refused to comply with the instructions of the Chief Customs Commissioner, not allowing the banks in Dalian to remit the local tax funds to Shanghai, on the grounds that he had received a letter from Kawai, the Director of the Diplomatic Department of the Kwantung Government, stating that under the current circumstances, remitting tax funds to Shanghai would be a highly provocative action. If remitted, the "Manchukuo" authorities would implement countermeasures and greatly harm the interests of the Japanese in the Kwantung Leased Territory. Therefore, he (Kawai) strongly advocated that the remittance should be postponed until the current dispute is resolved. The Chief Customs Commissioner, upon receiving this strange news, telegraphed the Customs Commissioner, objecting to his passive attitude, and ordered him to remit immediately. If he did not comply with the instructions, it would be regarded as insubordination. The Customs Commissioner subsequently telegraphed the following reply: "The passive attitude is the only one possible for me at present. I am consciously warned by the responsible Japanese authorities that if the Dalian Customs openly breaks with the 'Manchukuo' authorities, it will destroy the interests of the Japanese. As a Japanese, I cannot be tolerated if I promote such a break, and it violates my conscience. I implore the Chief Customs Commissioner to understand my difficulty in not being able to bear the responsibility." Now, because Fukumoto disobeyed the orders, he has been dismissed by the Minister of Finance, Song Ziwen. Fukumoto's violation of legal orders is unprecedented in the history of Chinese Customs.</p>

<p>Please Urge Friendly Countries to Take Measures to Stop It</p>
<p>Reuters Shanghai News, the Shanghai Banking Association, the Qianye Association, and the National Federation of Commerce Associations, yesterday issued a foreign declaration on the Northeast Customs issue. The translation is as follows: Japan, through its own puppet state, seizes Northeast Customs. This move not only violates existing treaties, but also threatens the collapse of Chinese finance and politics. Northeast tax revenue accounts for 15% of the national customs revenue. China's important domestic and foreign debts are guaranteed by customs duties. If China's tax revenue is so seriously exploited, it will lead to extremely unfortunate consequences, plunging China into a long period of political and financial chaos. In order to safeguard the dignity of the treaty and to safeguard international trade and financial relations, friendly countries should take measures to stop Japan from implementing this tactic in order to avoid the collapse of China. Delay may be too late to save.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Spokesperson of the Anti-Drug Association Questions Wang's Remarks <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Hope that the Advanced Figures of the Party and the State</p>
<p>Will Not Be Confused by False Accusations</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association, being very concerned about the Nanjing special telegram published in various newspapers in this port yesterday, concerning the remarks of Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, on the opium policy, issued the following statement by its spokesperson yesterday afternoon. Yesterday's newspaper reported that President Wang said that in recent years, opium has not been banned in various parts of our country, and has become an open secret. At a time when the country's finances are extremely exhausted, it is better to implement openness, prohibiting it in the levy and implementing the ban on one side and gaining a source of wealth on the other to relieve the current financial difficulties. There are many people who make this proposal, but the central government has not yet made a decision because of the importance of the relationship. If there are other remedial measures, it is absolutely unwilling to implement this final policy. However, if it is handled properly, such as the policy of prohibiting it in the levy in India and the Philippines, the effect is not as bad as generally imagined. Wang's remarks followed closely after the central government reiterated the opium ban, which is tantamount to exposing the contradictions in the government's policy and expressing no sincerity or determination to ban smoking. The investigation of opium is not forbidden, not impossible to ban, but the government is unwilling to ban it. Otherwise, it can be banned at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and Hu cannot be banned today. Han Fuju in Shandong can be banned, and the central government Hu cannot be banned. If it is considered impossible to ban it because it is not banned, it is self-deception. If there is a desire not to ban it, so that the smoking disaster spreads, and then used as a reason for open sale, is it not a plan to cover one's ears and steal the bell? Wang also said, "It is better to implement openness, prohibiting it in the levy and implementing the ban on one side." If one side relies on opium as a source of wealth and the other side implements a ban, such a contradictory and contradictory approach, even a child knows that there is no such reason. If you want to collect taxes, you can't ban it. If you want to ban it, you should sacrifice the tobacco tax. In short, those who prohibit it in the levy actually levy it without banning it. If you want to ban smoking, you should take the method of banning it without levying it. It is also said that "If there are other remedial measures, it is absolutely unwilling to implement this final policy." The government has the natural duty to protect the people, this is an easy definition, even if there is no way to think of it, it should not implement a policy that harms the people. If the skin is gone, what will the hair be attached to? Premier Sun Yat-sen's legacy of rejecting drugs said, "The declaration of war on opium must never be compromised. If a responsible government agency, for its own private convenience, lowers the flag and stops the war on opium, no matter how long, it is an act of treason." If this so-called final opium public sale method is implemented, where is the legacy of Premier Sun Yat-sen? Today, the authorities who claim to be loyal followers of Premier Sun Yat-sen will not act for their own private convenience. It is also said that "The United Kingdom in India, the United States in the Philippines, have adopted a policy of prohibiting it in the levy, and its effect is not as bad as generally imagined." The Indians have suffered deeply from opium, which is one of the reasons for the demise of the country. The Indians have been groaning and seeking liberation during the British rule in India. Gandhi's anti-British thought arose from dissatisfaction with the British opium policy in India. Even the British opposed the government's policy. How can our government follow it to slaughter its own compatriots? As for the Philippines, it has adopted a complete ban policy. The US government has not collected a cent of tobacco tax. If the government adopts this policy, we would welcome it very much. As for the policy of prohibiting it in the levy, how is the performance? You can look at the performance of the Tobacco Prohibition Inspection Office last year. Although it was only established for eight days, the local merchants and traitors congratulated each other, the corrupt officials and greedy officials were ecstatic, and the wind of dogmatism and fly营營 was all over the country. The image of the destruction of the country and the extinction of the species is all in front of you. Today, what are the abuses of the special tax in the two lakes? The people of the country are sincerely afraid to lead the education again. I hope that Wang Jingwei, as the advanced of the party and the country, will not be bewildered by slanderous accusations. The party and the country are very fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Japanese Riverboats Under Navy Management <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Implemented from Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai, the tasks of protecting overseas Chinese in Shanghai are all the responsibility of the Navy. Recently, ships and troops have been added along the Yangtze River, and no effort has been spared. Renting ships for military use, managing merchant ships, and assisting in the transportation of Japanese goods in order to break our country's rejection of goods. Recently, inferior goods have been imported very crowded, and more are imported into the Yangtze River. The actions of the Japanese Navy will be investigated and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Management of Riverboats. The shipping of Nisshin Co. is the largest in the Yangtze River, with more than 20 ships, operating in the upper and lower reaches of each port. After the January 28th Incident, all business was suspended, and the Japanese Navy rented the Daifuku No. 94 ship, running from Shanghai to Wuhan, for the transportation of materials and the like. After the withdrawal of troops, the leased ships were returned to Nisshin on June 1. However, because the Chinese refused to transport Japanese ships after the war, Nisshin's Yangtze River ships had no way to resume business. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Navy in Shanghai contacted Nisshin again and continued to rent several first-class riverboats of the company, such as the Fengyang Maru, Nanyang Maru, and Xiangyang Maru, from yesterday, still running from Shanghai to Wuhan. All operations are under the management of the Navy. On the upper river side, there is also the Xinyang Maru, running from Wuhan to Yichang, also under the management of the Navy. Chinese buyers do not get on the ship, because the management is under the Navy.</p>
<p>Escorting Japanese Goods. Japanese goods have recently been imported very crowded. Nisshin Post's special Sino-Japanese liners to Shanghai are always full of loads, most of which are transported to the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Since Chinese ships do not transport them on behalf, they are all transferred by Japanese ships. Using the Navy to transport rented ships, packing Japanese goods to the Yangtze River, on the surface, can be listed as military supplies, transported out of Wusong to hide the eyes and ears of the Chinese people, and landing at the port is more convenient. The company can also deny it, one stroke and several good preparations, its intention is deep, the plan is周, it is not国人所能察知, so the Japanese goods运数千吨.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Withdraw. The Japanese Navy fleet in Shanghai has completely withdrawn, leaving only four torpedoes from the 15th Squadron, because they巡长江, 末归国也. The current warships have been电令归国 by the Japanese Navy. Three torpedo ships of the team have already奉令载海軍 three teams. They left Shanghai yesterday morning and returned to Sasebo directly. The Japanese warships left in Shanghai are now only gunboats and torpedo boats.</p>
<p>Flagship is Coming Soon. Shanghai Japanese Navy has been列入 First Outside遣队内所辖, from沪至汉, Shang达宜昌, originally派日舰 fourteen艘者,今已扩至 twenty艘矣, a 遣队司令驻沪, 惟近日日海軍为增厚驻华海軍实力计, specially将第三艦隊司令旗艦出云,移驻沪上, the new commander, Zuo 近司, reported to Shanghai yesterday by电沪, that he has乘出云舰, from Sasebo to Shanghai today, at the latest on the 28th, he can抵申, after that, the Japanese warships in the Yangtze River are all under his command, and the third team of warships is temporarily stationed in Japan, which can also be transferred to Shanghai when necessary, there was no such commander before the January 28th Incident, it was only added after the war.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Extraterritorial Road Construction Pending Case <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Continued Negotiations Yesterday</p>
<p>Principles Are No Longer Different</p>
<p>The Two Sides Temporarily Keep Secret</p>
<p>The pending case of the extraterritorial road construction by the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau has been brought to a conclusion after negotiations between the representatives of the Public Concession Bureau and the representatives of the Municipal Government. After approval by the authorities of both sides, it can be finally resolved. The Board of Directors of the Public Concession Bureau had once discussed the case last Wednesday. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also recently approved and sent it to Shanghai. There is no longer any objection to the agreed principle. However, a few points need to be revised in the articles. Municipal Government Representative Yu Hongjun and Public Concession Bureau Representative Fei Ren Xindun continued to meet at 12:30 yesterday afternoon to discuss the points that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs indicated needed to be revised. They dispersed in about an hour. The negotiation process was very harmonious. Both sides now hope to continue to meet within the next week. After about two more meetings, the case can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>Yu Hongjun Speaks. A reporter from the East China News Agency visited Secretary-General Yu at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon and asked about the content of the negotiations. According to Yu, both parties are eager to resolve this negotiation as soon as possible, so although there are many difficulties in the negotiations, they can still understand each other. The points that we have revised are difficult to publish temporarily because we respect the intentions of both parties, but the principle has not changed. There are many modifications in the wording, and so is the other party. According to the current situation, it can be completely resolved after one more meeting. However, before signing, I will decide to publicly solicit opinions from all walks of life to show that there is no loss of sovereignty. My negotiation will be based on the principle of not giving up sovereignty. The reason for the temporary secrecy is that once it is publicly announced, it will cause misunderstandings and hinder the progress of the matter. Although this negotiation is a local event, the Municipal Government will solicit the opinions of the Central Government at any time. The opposition of the expatriates of various countries is expected. There is no reason at first, and there is no need to refute it.</p>
<p>Fei Xindun Speaks. The reporter visited Mr. Fei Xindun, the Director of the Public Concession Bureau, yesterday and asked whether the Public Concession Bureau has full power to resolve the case, or whether it needs to be approved by the Consular Corps. Fei replied that this case is currently being resolved by the Public Concession Bureau, and there is no need to ask the Consular Corps for instructions.</p>
<p>The content is temporarily not published. As for the agreed content, both representatives will not publish it for the time being because it is not the time yet. However, it is roughly the same as what our newspaper previously published. The outline is that the extraterritorial road construction area is divided into a special administrative region, and the Municipal Government and the Public Concession Bureau each recommend half of the personnel to form an administrative committee. The chairman is appointed by the Municipal Government, and the vice-chairman is recommended by the Public Concession Bureau. A special police force is formed to maintain law and order. The patrol chief is appointed by the Municipal Government, and the vice-patrol chief is recommended by the Public Concession Bureau. The administrative expenses are borne jointly by the Municipal Government and the Public Concession Bureau. The patrol tax and health affairs are all under the Public Concession Bureau. The Municipal Public Utility Bureau can issue special licenses for electricity, telephone, and tap water, and the three companies of the concession can undertake it.</p>
<h3 id="e169">HUPU ARSENAL STILL HAS HOPE FOR CONTINUATION <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>LIN AND WANG, TWO REPRESENTATIVES, RETURNED YESTERDAY TO REPORT</p>
<p>CHEN YI HAS ORDERED THE HANDLING COMMITTEE TO TEMPORARILY POSTPONE PROCEEDINGS</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Shanghai Arsenal was almost shut down due to a report submitted by two Western advisors to the Ordnance Department, Bruce and Martin. Before that, the arsenal sent three representatives to the capital: Hu Sihong, Chief of the Review Department; Lin Weirong, Director of the Bullet Factory; and Wang Cheng, Director of the Shell Factory. They explained the situation to the Ministry of Military Affairs. Now, Directors Lin and Wang have returned to Shanghai yesterday morning to report to their colleagues at the arsenal on the negotiations in the capital. However, Hu Sihong is still staying in the capital. The following is a record of yesterday's situation and interviews with Lin and Wang:</p>
<p>Three Factories to Be Shut Down  This time, the arsenal shutdown does not only include the Shanghai Arsenal, but also the Jinan Arsenal in Shandong Province and the Huayin Arsenal in Shaanxi Province. The plan was to merge the equipment of these three factories into the Jinling, Hanyang, and Gongxian Arsenals. Subsequently, both the Jinan and Huayin Arsenals explained the advantages and disadvantages to the government, and were thus preserved. Moreover, the Huayin Arsenal is currently under construction, and it would be particularly difficult to order a shutdown at this time. However, according to news obtained by reporters from other sources regarding the Shanghai Arsenal, the results of Hu, Lin, and Wang's trip to Beijing to explain the situation is that the Ministry must seek instructions from the Military Affairs Commission regarding whether to shut down the arsenal or not. As Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has not yet sent a reply, it is still unknown. However, the first step achieved by the three representatives is that if they had not gone to Beijing, the Jinling, Hanyang, and Gongxian Arsenals would have already sent personnel to Nanjing and then to Hangzhou, planning to allocate and collect the equipment from the Shanghai Arsenal that was to be sent to Hangzhou. Now, not only are the collection personnel staying in the capital, but the organization of the handling committee has also been instructed by Acting Minister Chen Yi to temporarily postpone proceedings. Therefore, the Shanghai Arsenal still has a glimmer of hope for not being shut down, and everything must await Chiang Kai-shek's reply.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Arsenal's Assets  The reporter believes that it seems too uneconomical to abandon the original factory buildings of the Shanghai Arsenal and allocate them to the three Jinling arsenals, and then build new buildings. However, according to someone familiar with the arsenal's affairs, the situation is not entirely like this. The arsenal only has land in Shanghai, nearly 800 mu, and the Pudong ammunition depot has 40 to 50 mu. Moreover, establishing a commercial factory along the Huangpu River is quite suitable. Calculating at 4,000 yuan per mu, this income will exceed 4.5 million yuan. With this, what worries are there about building new factory buildings? Therefore, the central government abolished the Shanghai Arsenal and allocated it to the three arsenals in Jinling and other places, actually because of this. Otherwise, at a time when finances are exhausted, increasing this construction cost would probably not be possible, let alone having factory buildings that can be sold. The reporter believes that what they said is reasonable, so I will record it.</p>
<p>Interview with the Two Representatives  Yesterday, the reporter heard that Lin Weirong, Director of the Bullet Factory, and Wang Cheng, Director of the Shell Factory, who went to Beijing, had returned to Shanghai during the agricultural break. The reporter immediately rushed to inquire about the process. According to the two representatives, Lin and Wang, we arrived in Beijing on the 21st and, together with Director Hu and Chen Shihong, Director of the Cannon Factory, who was staying in Beijing for official business, we paid a visit to Chen Yi, Acting Minister of Military Affairs, and explained in detail: (1) The dismantling and transportation of the Shanghai Arsenal's machines to Hangzhou will take more than four months. If methods are not devised to install them as soon as possible, they may rust and become unusable. (2) When dismantling the machines, due to the emergency situation, the parts of one machine were packed into several boxes, or the parts of several machines were packed into one box. Therefore, if the Shanghai Arsenal's machines are moved and installed as a whole, there will be no difficulty. If the suggestions of the German advisors Bruce and Martin, who are unfamiliar with the situation of the Shanghai Arsenal, are adopted, and the Shanghai Arsenal's machines are distributed to the three Jinling, Hanyang, and Gongxian Arsenals, it is feared that due to the chaotic parts, most of the machines will be discarded. (3) If the machines are distributed to various factories, each factory must also build factory buildings and increase power, which is actually a waste of resources. It is better to preserve the entire factory and use the old site, or move to another site to build a house and use commercial electricity, which is cheaper. (4) The Shanghai Arsenal has produced excellent products at low cost over the years. During the Ordnance Department's performance appraisal, it was ranked first. During this anti-Japanese war, all the workers of the arsenal worked hard together under dangerous circumstances, risking their lives. The output of ammunition to support the 19th Route Army in one month was almost equal to the output of the past two and a half months. The Ordnance Department once issued an order to commend and comfort them beyond the ordinary. Later, they were ordered to dismantle the machines and move them to Zhejiang Province, originally hoping to determine the factory base as soon as possible and start work as soon as possible. However, for four months, there has been no news. Some of the employees who have been suspended with pay and the temporary dismissed workers have hanged themselves or drowned themselves due to economic pressure. The weak are like this, and the strong will take risks. Therefore, Vice Minister Chen was very clear about the reasons why the machines should be installed as soon as possible and should not be dispersed, and he was very concerned about maintaining the entire Shanghai Arsenal so that workers would not lose their jobs, so as to emphasize the national economy. He promised to forward a telegram to Chairman Chiang, asking him to reconsider the suggestions of the German advisors, hoping that the future progress of the Shanghai Arsenal would be in line with the principles of developing the national economy and people's livelihood. Later, Lin and Wang also said that after visiting Vice Minister Chen, they also visited Hong Zhong, Director of the Ordnance Department, and visited the heads of various departments in the department, explaining the situation of the Shanghai Arsenal in detail based on the facts. Previously, the Ordnance Department had an "Equipment and Materials Handling Committee for the Shanghai Arsenal" organized based on the suggestions of the German advisors. Now, Chen instructed that before Nanjing receives Chairman Chiang's reply, the committee plans to postpone the proceedings. In short, whether the Shanghai Arsenal will be shut down has not yet been officially ordered, and there is no phenomenon of rushing to complete the factory. Now, this proposal to preserve the entire Shanghai Arsenal's machines and not disperse them to various factories to cause losses has been accepted by Chen, so the Shanghai Arsenal should not be destroyed. It is heard that Lin and Wang will still need to go to Beijing in the next few days to complete the work with Hu Sihong.</p>
<h3 id="e170">ANTI-EPIDEMIC VOICE CAUSES A LABOR STRIKE IN THE CHINESE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>THE REASON IS A MATTER OF LABOR-MANAGEMENT CONDITIONS</p>
<p>REFUSAL OF OUTSIDE WORKERS AS SUBSTITUTES LEADS TO STRIKE</p>
<p>All the employees of the Chinese Medicine Industry in this city held a membership meeting yesterday because the capitalists ordered outside workers to join the trade union, and disputes occurred at that time. Fortunately, the police officers of the Public Security Bureau stopped them, and many important cases were resolved. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cause of the Labor Strike  The Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the outside workers and inside workers, have been divided by the Central Training Department of the Ministry of Industry. Regarding the issue of outside workers as substitutes, it was resolved at a meeting on June 15 that outside shop assistants should be registered and introduced by the association to each store to fill in as substitutes, and that the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union should be rejected from sending outside workers as substitutes. It was stipulated that members who violated the regulations would be expelled from membership and notified to each store to comply. This led to disputes in pharmacies such as Feng Cunren and Cai Tongde refusing to send substitute workers from the union. On the 23rd, more than 5,000 employees were summoned by the union to a meeting of representatives of workers from various districts. Because the matter was of great importance, a membership meeting was held to discuss the direction of the work.</p>
<p>Workers' Congress  Yesterday at 2 p.m., pharmaceutical workers held a congress of members' representatives at the Yaowang Temple in Xiaonanmen. Members of the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau were sent to guide the meeting. More than 1,200 members' representatives were present. Zhao Zhenhui, Yuan Pinzhang, Feng Jikang, Cai Shenxiu, Chen Yuantao, and other five people were the presidium. First, Zhao Zhenhui reported that the capitalists have repeatedly unreasonably suppressed, disregarded the overall situation, and the suffering of unemployed workers, which is hateful. Then, the chairmen reported on the work one after another and began to discuss it.</p>
<p>Dispute Occurs  During the discussion, regarding the capitalists' refusal to allow outside workers as substitutes, some workers advocated a general strike to promote the capitalists' awareness. Representatives of the Party and government organs tried their best to dissuade them. Later, Fang Zheng, who had been expelled from the union, made a speech without permission, which led to a dispute. The situation was very serious, and the order in the whole field was chaotic. Fortunately, the police officers from the Third Branch of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were dispatched to maintain order, which calmed the situation and continued the discussion.</p>
<p>Resolution of Important Cases  The general assembly resolved the following items: (1) How to deal with the capitalists' pharmaceutical industry association breaking the conditions? Resolution: (A) Unanimously opposed, (B) Issue a declaration to refute the association, (C) Warn the capitalists; (2) How to deal with the capitalists using differentiation methods to refuse substitute workers? Resolution: (A) Petition to higher authorities for assistance, (B) If a certain store refuses outside substitute workers, the outside workers of that store will be ordered to strike, (C) If a certain store's strike fails to achieve victory, then everyone will rise up to help; (3) How to deal with the association's enticement of outside workers to join? Resolution: Outside workers unanimously and automatically oppose; (4) Request higher authorities to restore the name of the workers' union. Resolution: Passed; (5) Request the capitalists to increase wages by 10 yuan per month for each person. Resolution: Passed; (6) Unemployed members of this association request the capitalists to arrange for them to be employed. Resolution: Must be controlled by this association; (7) Lower-level organization of this association. Resolution: The district branches should be responsible for stepping up organization; (8) The term of office of the directors and supervisors of this association has expired. Should they be re-elected on a regular basis? Resolution: Postpone the re-election; (9) How to deal with Cai Tongde not sending representatives to attend? Resolution: Send a letter to warn them, and those previously arranged by this association to employ workers will be driven out and replaced with other unemployed members; (10) Should a committee to demand wage increases be established? Resolution: Organize a wage increase movement committee, and elect Xie Shifang, Fang Qingjian, Zhang Tongfu, Yuan Pinzhang, Feng Jikang, Chen Yuantao, Zhao Zhenhui, Fang Qinghe, Zhu Jiaqing, Han Bingshou, Yang Xihui, Cai Shenxiu, Hu Hanrong, Shi Zongliang, Ma Weixin, and other 15 people as members; (11) How to deal with Cai Tongde in the concession if their ability is not achieved? Resolution: Petition to the higher authorities to transfer the patrol protection; (12) Should the unemployed members of this association be organized? Resolution: The organization section is responsible for organizing the unemployed group.</p>

<p>JIANGFENG ARRIVED AT GAO CHANG MIAO YESTERDAY AFTERNOON FOR REPAIRS</p>
<p>The Jiangfeng aircraft of the Naval Aircraft Office in Gaochangmiao of this port, which departed from Hangzhou the day before yesterday, along with Jiangpeng, Jiangyan, and Jianghong, to come to Shanghai, had changing weather when it flew to Haiyan. Jiangfeng had no choice but to land, and the others also returned to Hangzhou due to headwinds. Yesterday morning, Jiangfeng continued to fly to Shanghai, and the people and the plane were safe. The following is a record of the process:</p>
<p>Aircraft Move to Hangzhou  Since Shen Dexie took office as the factory director of the Naval Aircraft Office, a part of the aircraft was moved to the Hongqiao Airport for the use of training students to drive. Only three or four seaplanes were placed in Shangchangmiao. Later, due to the Japanese army's operations in Shanghai, fearing that they would be destroyed, they were all moved to Jianqiao, Hangzhou. However, the aircraft arrived soon after and two aircraft were bombed. The remaining aircraft were moved to West Lake, including Jianghong, Jiangou, Jiangpeng, Jiangyan, Jiangyi, Jiangyang, Jiangyuan, Jiangkun, Jiangfeng, and other nine reconnaissance aircraft. Now that Shen believes that the Shanghai war has been settled, he ordered them to fly back to Shanghai one after another.</p>
<p>Four Aircraft Departed  Director Shen of the office ordered them to fly to Shanghai. Except for Jiangou, which returned to Shanghai earlier, Jiangfeng, Jianghong, Jiangyan, and Jiangpeng also flew to Shanghai the day before yesterday. The weather was very good when they departed from Hangzhou on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. It was very good. Unexpectedly, the weather suddenly changed near Haiyan. The original plan was to travel 280 li per hour, but due to headwinds, it was only 100 li. It was expected that it would take one and a half hours to reach Shanghai. After flying about 200 li, it had not yet reached Huangpu. Therefore, the three Jianghong aircraft feared that there would not be enough fuel and returned midway, but at that time only the Jiangfeng aircraft still bravely moved forward.</p>
<p>Forced to Land  The driver of Jiangfeng was the Westerner Puri, who was the instructor of the office. When he flew near Haiyan, he already felt the headwind. Soon he did not see the three aircraft behind him, and the weather in Haiyan was even worse. Therefore, he had to land on the inland river. It was already 4 p.m. at that time. After Puri inspected the entire aircraft, he was unable to fly to Shanghai, so he stayed overnight on the river.</p>
<p>Jiangfeng Arrives in Shanghai  Jiangfeng was not damaged. It continued to fly the next morning and flew away from Haiyan at 7:20 a.m. and arrived in Shanghai at 8:45 a.m. Because it was a seaplane, it landed in the Huangpu River in front of the Naval Aircraft Office in Gaochangmiao. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency arrived at the factory at noon and saw that Jiangfeng had entered the factory and was being inspected. As for the three aircraft that returned to Hangzhou, it is said that the weather is good today and they will still fly to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e179">GANSHANG TELEGRAM ASKING FOR THE REPEAL OF THE PRODUCTION AND SALES TAX <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Business Gang of the Shanghai Business Gang Association received news from Gansheng yesterday that the production and sales tax was being levied. It immediately invited various guest gangs to a meeting to decide to telegram the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Ministry of Finance and Industry, and the Jiangxi Provincial Government to repeal it immediately. The original telegram is as follows: "Your Excellency Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, I recently learned that the Jiangxi Provincial Government decided to levy a production and sales tax on goods and set up checkpoints along the way, which is no different from the revival of Lijin. We were very surprised to hear the news. Gansheng has suffered from natural disasters and bandits in recent years, and the people have nothing left to eat. Now, we have received news of this exorbitant levy. After the robbery, how can the merchants and people bear this? I beg you to quickly order the Jiangxi Provincial Government to repeal the production and sales tax regulations and abide by the national prestige of cutting Lijin and relieving the people of Gansheng. We are anxiously awaiting your orders." The Shanghai Business Gang Association and the Jiangxi Business Gang bowed respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e180">SHACHANG ALLIANCE ASKS FOR THE REPEAL OF THE SPECIAL COTTON TAX <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Association had previously telegraphed the central government, requesting that the special business tax implemented by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, including cotton, be rectified and recorded. Some time ago, the association received a batch of instructions from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance had been ordered to abolish the clause. However, in recent days, it has been heard that the tax will be levied on July 1. Therefore, the association yesterday telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance again, strictly ordering the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to stop the special business tax. The financial ministry's instructions and the association's telegram are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Instructions from the Ministry of Finance: "I have received your letter. I have checked the case of the Jiangsu Provincial Government's handling of the special business production and sales tax. I have already presented it to the Executive Yuan for instructions to open, and I will order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to still follow the previous order to abolish the tax. The Ministry has again ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to abolish it in accordance with the original plan of the Executive Yuan, and will also send a telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation to inform them." This is the batch.</p>
<p>Re-telegram Appeal: "Your Excellencies Wang, President of the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government, and Song, Minister of Finance, I previously telegraphed the Ministry and Province, requesting that the special business tax implemented by Su Province be stopped, as it is a disguised form of Lijin and violates the central government's Lijin cutting order, and especially goes against the principle of a single tax on a single item. I also heard that the government strictly ordered it to be stopped, and the people were delighted. It is true that I am grateful, but roads are being promoted, and the Su Provincial Government is disregarding everything and still setting the tax to be levied on July 1. I was shocked to hear that the laws are being ignored and the merchants are being harmed. From the perspective of the textile industry, the association is taking the cotton levy of the special business tax. The disadvantages are already innumerable. I am here to tell you that I have checked the abolition of Lijin last year and changed to a unified tax, which is based on the principle of a single tax on a single item. I swore to the world that the burden on merchants and people has increased several times more than in the past, but the merchants are happy and have no complaints. The original intention was to add tax revenue to the country and relieve the pain of Lijin. Unexpectedly, after more than a year, the Lijin of disguised forms has been revived, and the credibility of the central government has been swept away. This is one of the things that cannot be done. I have also checked that the textile factories in Su Province are concentrated in Shanghai. The factories set up in the interior are in the minority. They used to use local products and local sales, and they can barely gain a foothold. In recent years, cotton production has been poor, and most of the raw cotton is imported from abroad. The people in the interior are poor, and their purchasing power has decreased sharply. The cooked goods must be sold abroad, and transportation costs are increased. Compared with Shanghai factories, it is difficult to survive. If all the factories within the scope of Su Province are levied a special cotton business tax, according to the province's announcement, the American cotton tax is 1.28 yuan per stone, which is 4.48 yuan per package of cotton yarn. The factories that are not under the jurisdiction of Su Province have nothing to do with it. Such a malformed burden, in law and in sentiment, is not based on the machine. If the country is related to financial resources and restores the national Lijin, there is no room for merchants to complain. If it is implemented alone in a corner of Su Province, even Shanghai is excluded. This is what the Su Province textile industry is determined to oppose and cannot recognize. This is the second thing that cannot be done. The great disease of Lijin lies in setting up checkpoints to collect taxes, making things difficult, and the officials are also extorting money, harming the country and the merchants like snakes and scorpions. If you have a little common sense, you can say it. If you don't have a different mind, how can you bear to say it again? This is the third thing that cannot be done. Based on the above, in order to respect national laws, to consider the hardships of merchants, and to avoid disadvantages, the special business tax that Su Province intends to implement must not be allowed to be governed by the province and freely implemented. Moreover, Su Province is close to the capital, and the orders are still not being followed. No wonder foreigners place me as an unorganized country. If Su Province is in financial difficulties and there is no way to take measures, it should also be done separately. The method of opening up should not be the policy of depleting the lake. The merchants and people are painfully stripped of their skin and are eager to choose. For the sake of repeated appeal, I respectfully ask the chief to examine and approve the strict order for the Jiangsu Provincial Government's special business tax to be stopped immediately, so as to pay attention to the achievements and to care about the merchants. I am extremely grateful and awaiting orders." The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Mill Association respectfully bowed.</p>

First, the police lawyer Chen Ming explained the case and stated that the first defendant was being prosecuted for armed robbery under Article 346 of the Criminal Law, and the second defendant was being prosecuted for receiving stolen goods under Article 376 of the Criminal Law. He requested that the law be applied to the trial. When Zheng Bangyan was interrogated, he confessed to blocking the road and robbing. Yao Laosi admitted to receiving stolen goods.

<p>Recently, there have been unscrupulous elements who have used the name of the French Water and Electricity Company to recruit new workers and swindle them. It is heard that many people have been deceived. New workers often go to the company to ask about Zhou Ahe and others, intending to contact them for jobs. According to the trade union, there is no such person in the company. Zhou Ahe and others' actions clearly damage the company's reputation and damage the trade union movement, and they defraud outside workers. It is heard that the trade union has reported the matter to the Municipal Party Department, and hopes that the workers in the industry will pay attention and not be deceived.</p>

<p>To the esteemed editor: Having read the report in your newspaper about my injury and that of Mr. Tian in a car accident, I find it does not correspond with the facts. I am an employee of Tongcheng Company, and only sustained minor skin abrasions on both legs. Mr. Tian also only suffered external injuries. I hired a car to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment, after which he immediately left. The rumors are untrue, and I hereby make a correction. Respectfully submitted, Sheng Liangchen, Principal Writer, Local News Section, Shen Bao. June 24th.</p>

<p>— Songfu</p>
<p>The general still guards the frontier, vowing not to return until Lou Lan is defeated. Submitting to ignoble survival is not his ambition; he will promptly revolt to protect the homeland.</p>
<p>The southern spirit is inherently strong; a lone army resists the Japanese for long. Utterly eliminate the hatred of national subjugation; dare to rely on iron and blood to assist the central government.</p>
<p>The flames of war rage in Zhabei; a calamitous disaster surpassing the Hong-Yang Rebellion. Books and culture are turned to scorched earth, no less than the Qin Emperor of old.</p>
<p>More than a month of stealing life from the tiger's mouth, fleeing in distress, unable to live in peace. Turning back, I gaze north with furrowed brows; the former prosperity is now ruins.</p>
<p>Airplanes buzz and circle at will; the fate of the nation is at stake. Hurriedly escaping the tiger's den at dawn, the whole family is startled and sleepless.</p>
<p>The sound of artillery fire fills the night with terror; the displaced people sadly live out their lives. Both north and south of the Shanghai River suffer calamity; the sound of the watchman's clapper is always heard.</p>
<p>Two months have passed since the ceasefire; the withdrawal of Japanese troops is still delayed. Although the League of Nations conference has concluded, this is the time to strive for a strong nation.</p>
<p>The institutions set up by the puppets are full of thorns; they extort from everyone, but who can they turn to? Their cries are no different from the Stone Moat official; the old woman goes out the door, tears streaming down.</p>

<h3 id="e235">How Ice Cream is Made <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Baitao</p>
<p>In summer, ice cream has become our only wonderful product for escaping the heat. When the sultry heat is overwhelming, taking spoonful after spoonful with a silver spoon, or savoring it with your tongue, is the most enjoyable thing.</p>
<p>The texture of high-quality ice cream is exceptionally smooth. This smoothness depends on the proportions of the various ingredients and the freezing technique.</p>
<p>The usual method for mixing ice cream: 60 to 70 percent is water, with the rest being sugar, milk, coloring, and fat. The fat exists in small globules in the milk, which can only be seen with a microscope. The sugar is dissolved before being added. When freezing it, it must be frozen extremely finely and transparently; the finer the better. Therefore, we must put it in an ice cream maker and stir it vigorously until it tastes exceptionally smooth on your tongue.</p>
<p>To know whether these ingredients are well-mixed, just see if the ice cream has small air bubbles after mixing and stirring.</p>
<p>After the ice cream is made, it can be divided into thin slices, packed into paper boxes, and then sealed off from the air or put in the refrigerator.</p>
<p>You must vigorously beat air into the ice cream to give it viscosity, or add some cornstarch, gum, dried egg yolk, or eggs to the ingredients. These components account for a very small proportion.</p>

<h3 id="e236">One of the Arts of Running a School <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Private schools rely on tuition fees for their funding. Naturally, the more students, the better. But in Shanghai, private schools are everywhere, as numerous as carp crossing the river. If you don't understand the art of running a school, you are guaranteed to fail. Running a school has its art, which outsiders might not believe. But people running schools in Shanghai really must have the skills of a school-running artist.</p>
<p>First, let me talk about recruitment advertisements. These advertisements are not those placed in newspapers but those pasted on walls. Because during summer and winter vacations, schools in Shanghai use colorful advertisements pasted on the walls. With summer vacation approaching, the recruitment advertisements on the walls are increasing day by day.</p>
<p>"Pasting recruitment advertisements earlier than others will attract attention."</p>
<p>"If the school is registered, the words 'Registered with the Municipal Bureau of Education' must be placed on top of the advertisement. This way, no matter how bad the content is, people will think that your school must be very good to be registered."</p>
<p>"If there are famous people known to everyone on the board of directors, you must print their names on the advertisement."</p>
<p>"The characters used in the advertisement must be artistic. Dull characters will not attract attention. If there are slogans attached, add more exclamation points '!' for punctuation."</p>
<p>"The color of the paper and the color of the characters on the advertisement must also be appropriately matched to attract attention. Black characters on white paper are not as eye-catching as blue characters, so the color scheme must also be considered!"</p>
<p>"Using two-color or three-color printed recruitment advertisements, with the middle characters printed half red and half green, will of course be even more effective. This method can be widely adopted."</p>
<p>"When various schools successively recruit students, it is best to have someone post recruitment advertisements every day, because soon after you post them, someone will paste someone else's recruitment advertisement on top, covering yours."</p>
<p>"As for recruitment advertisements in newspapers, the position must be prominent, the space occupied must be large, the characters must be written specially, registration must also be indicated, more famous directors should be written about, and it should be published earlier and stopped later than others...If the principal and dean have doctoral or master's degrees, it can naturally also be printed."</p>
<p>How many schools are there in Shanghai? To win, you must compete, and recruitment advertising is one of the competitive weapons. Alas! The means of enthusiastic education are like this?</p>

<h3 id="e237">After a Ship Encounters Danger <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Mengyu</p>
<p>A few days ago, the French mail ship "Georges Philippar" caught fire in the Red Sea, and the river steamer "Yiling" ran aground and sank near Xuan Chang. Recently, it was discovered that the Shengjing, Xin Jiang Tian, and other ships were almost in danger. What terrible tragedies! What do you all think when you recall the chaotic scenes of all the people on board frantically escaping? But while passengers can escape, the crew must still carry out rescue measures. Perhaps you don't know the emergency work of the crew at this time. I used to serve on a German merchant ship and personally encountered such a danger. Now, I will write down the situation at the time for you to see.</p>
<p>Our ship was a cargo ship without passengers. On the night of December 1, 1929, it accidentally hit a reef on Dongsha Island, and three large holes were broken in the bottom of the ship. Sea water poured in like a fountain. The situation was extremely dangerous at the time. Fortunately, it was not far from a shoal, so the captain immediately increased speed and steered towards the shoal while summoning the crew. Everyone quickly put on life jackets and began rescue work. Rescue efforts were roughly divided into the following types:</p>
<p>(1) Transmitting the distress call SOS by radio;</p>
<p>(2) Firing distress rockets (these rockets are made of thick bamboo, filled with gunpowder. When fired, they rise dozens of feet, and ships within ten miles can see them. They are actually the same as the "moon cannons" played with during the New Year, but bigger); If it is daytime, then instead of firing rockets, distress flags are raised;</p>
<p>(3) Continuously sounding the foghorn, about once every ten seconds.</p>
<p>There were also self-rescue methods:</p>
<p>(1) The sailors put the lifeboats into the water beside the ship so that they could escape into the boats when the big ship sank;</p>
<p>(2) Using extremely large pumps in the bottom of the ship to pump out the water entering through the broken holes.</p>
<p>In the end, the radio reached the Little Luzon coastal radio station, which sent a warship to rescue us from danger. No one was killed or injured, but because the navigation rules stipulate "rescuing people, not objects," everyone's luggage and clothes were lost.</p>
<p>After we safely reached the shore, the captain said to me: "Everyone ideally thinks that after a big ship sinks, they can rely on lifeboats and life jackets. In reality, ships sink too quickly at sea, and if other ships don't arrive in time to rescue, then passengers and crew will inevitably lose their lives. Imagine that a ship in distress is blown by the wind and tossed by the waves, unable to control itself, leading to this misfortune. Can lifeboats withstand such great winds and waves? Wearing a life jacket and floating on the water is even more useless, because the seawater is very cold and the waves are high. People who can swim might be able to last for a quarter of an hour; people who can't swim will die in five minutes. This method is indeed effective in small rivers."</p>
