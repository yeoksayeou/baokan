<h3>人心未死　元</h3>
<p>人謂我科學不如人。物質文明不如人。槍砲器械不如人我俯首承認。之若謂我愛國之心不如人。認識公理不如人。則我誓死不能承認也。我國人惟自知槍砲器械之不如人。故有時呑聲忍氣。甘心屈服於强暴武力之下。惟至忍無可忍之時。則亦不惜犧牲一切。抛頭顱。毁家室。以共赴國難。試觀日軍强佔遼瀋。馬占山李杜等以忍無可忍而奮起抵抗。日軍迫攻上海。蔡延楷等以忍無可忍而奮起迎擊。溥儀組織僞政府。東北各義勇軍。以忍無可忍而奮起攻討此即我國人愛國心未滅公理未忘之一證也。馬杜蔡及各義勇軍。每一慷慨悲歌之義舉起。我全國社會。莫不歡呼鼓掌。捐輸援助。惟恐不及。甚至年輕之學童。無力之勞工。亦皆不遠千里。携筐負物以相慰勞。此又非我一般人愛國心未滅公理未忘之一證乎。今者上海愛國靑年惲蕙芳之被拘。國人莫不爲之惋惜。營救者多至百餘團體。交保之日各團體爭具保狀。出院時歡聲雷動。反之若閘北漢奸胡立夫之被拘。則莫不同聲稱快。各團體紛請嚴懲。萬人唾駡。此又非我一般人愛國心未滅公理未忘之一證乎。夫惲之愛國行動例以馬杜蔡等抗日之愛國行動。其事若甚小。胡之漢奸行爲。例以鄭孝胥熙洽等贊助僞組織之漢奸行爲。又若甚微。然而我國人對此兩事之表示。一則極盡其愛護欽敬。一則極盡其痛恨憤慨。可見我國人之愛國心與主張公理之心。隨在而伏。隨地可以表現而非偶一爲之泛然無根者也。吾於此有兩種感想。</p>
<p>第一。我國人具此愛國與主張公理之心。祗須堅持實行。而不求人知。人譏我爲一閧之民。勿怒也。祗須自求所以不一閧。人譏我無是非之國家。勿怒也祗須自求所以明白其是非。而不違反公理。蓋我人之愛國行動。本非以之　炫人我人之主張公理。亦非以之自誇。不過求達我救國之目的耳。人之知與不知。與我無關。亦與我所行之事實無關。人人但求實行愛國而不求人知。是謂之眞愛國。人人但求實行主張公理而不求人知。是謂之眞能主張公理。者此第一義也。</p>
<p>第二。我國人具此愛國與主張公理之心。不能以此自限而須發揮擴大。威脅利誘勿動也。艱苦困難勿退也。勿以小難而忽勿以大難而懼。勿以一時之憤而越我範圍。勿以事久遷延而怠我素志。團結須堅固。勿以内部偶生意見而先自猜疑目的須認淸。勿以環境之變易而先自游移。我全國人持此共同之目的。堅强不屈之精神。以一致救國。始終不衰。則自能獲最後之效果。此第二義也。</p>
<p>愛國心不滅。公理不忘。即我國人心未死。人心一日不死。則我國一日可以有救。</p>

<h3>印度參政權規定分配辦法</h3>
<p>英相發表聲明書</p>
<p>印度選舉採民族分選制</p>
<p>▲路透社十六日倫敦電　英政府今日一致决定處理印度民族問題辦法、首相麥唐納已發表聲明書、選舉採用民族分選制、但印度敎徒在瑪德拉斯省、聯合省比哈哇利柴省、與中央省、有絕對多數議席、印度敎徒在孟買與亞桑亦將佔優勢、而回敎徒則在西北邊省有多數議席、在孟哲布亦佔多數、在孟加拉回敎徒雖比印度敎徒議席較多、但非絕對多數、政府聲明書、謂印度各民族屢欲自謀解决、終不能彼此獲一協定、故政府乃擔任解决此問題之工作、蓋此事不解决、則終爲憲法發展之障碍也云、英相麥唐納關於印度事件之聲明書、謂政府今猶未抛棄印人能自行成立一種協定之希望、故現有計畫之範圍有限、僅適用於省議會、至於中央議會參政權之先例、將來再行考慮、苟非爲關係各方面所贊同、英政府不欲與聞修正其自已計畫之談判、亦不欲考慮任何修正、憲法將規定十年後得修正參議法、但須得有關係者之同意、英政府在分選問題上、覺不能廢除爲少數民族所必要之保障、故每省印度敎徒回敎徒被壓迫民族錫克族印度基督敎徒英印混合族與歐人、皆各有選舉區、此外女界實業界學界工界及地主、亦皆有特别選舉區、惟此辦法、隨各界情形而異例、如錫克人僅在本哲布與西北邊省有議員、而歐人與工黨則在邊省無議員也、回敎徒在本哲布與孟加拉兩省人數獨多、故參政權亦較大、本哲布有議席一百七十五、而回敎徒佔八十六席、雖非絕對多數、然回敎徒猶可佔地主三議席、及三特别席、故在事實上、回敎徒可適獲過半數、錫克人在本哲布省爲有勢力之少數民族、將有三十二席、並或可得一特别席、故錫克人在人民中佔百分之一三但在參政權上佔百分一八·九、回敎徒在孟加拉省二百五十席中、有一百十一席、並可獲數特别席、故回敎徒在孟加拉省不獲過半數、而握權力之平衡者、爲歐人二十五席、被壓迫民族有特殊待遇、此等民族、乃下等階級之印度敎徒、說者謂宜予以特殊參政權、俾改善其狀况、而廢除其「不得與敎外人」接觸之惡習、彼等將在普通印人選舉區中投票、至於女子參政權、現規定三十七席、女界聲明雖欲有參政權、但不要求特惠、英政府承認新議會應有女議員至少數人之重要、故特定女議席若干、惟女議員不得從一個民族中選出、故除西北邊界外、各省皆有女子選舉區、計三十七女席、印度敎徒　二十五席、錫克人一席、回敎徒九席、印度基督敎徒與英印混合族各一席、工黨在省議會中佔三十八席、依照現制、則僅九席耳、英相麥唐納稱、以上辦法、頗爲公允、可平衡各方面之爭執、且爲可以實施之方法、印人須自知彼等自已一再失敗、未能提出具體辦法、此種問題、僅印人能解决之、尙望印度民衆各自承認民族合作爲進步之條件、而謀新憲法之實施云、内閣現考慮第二步驟、大約將在倫敦續有商榷、以便草擬政府所提出印度憲之法完全提案、</p>

<h3>國聯調查團返歐期</h3>
<p>▲編製報告可照預期完成</p>
<p>▲大約下月初間離平返歐　　北平通信、國際聯盟會之調查委員團、目前正在編製報告、并整理所搜集之大宗文件、以作參考、報告書現已着手編撰、委員團深冀此項報告書、能照預定日期、於九月十五日送達日内瓦、但歐洲方面、頗有人以爲七月一日國聯大會决議、將討論中日爭執事件之六個月限期、予以延長一層、（此項期限、係依照國聯盟約第十二條及第十五條所定、）實與調查團之工作進行狀况有關、此則接近調查團之方面所深爲詫異者也、日内瓦方面之感想、似爲第十二條限期延長之原因一、方由於調查團組織與出發之遷延、一方復由於調查團工作進行之遲緩、甚至有人以爲調查團因不能如期完成報告書、曾自請展期、然按之實際、殊不如是、關於期限問題之困難、實由事勢而生、緣中國最初赴訴於國聯會時、其所援用者、爲盟約之第十一條至調查團出發以後、中國始援用第十五之規定、第十一條原無期限、六個月以内之限制、乃第十二條之規定、因第十五條而引起者也、由是可見調查團之組織及其所負使命、實係以第十一條爲根據、設國聯係依照第十五條之規定、而辦理調查手續、則其選派之團體、或另爲一種組織、其人員當以在當地者爲限、其所賦與之職權、將較有限制、其所提出之報告書範圍當較狹、而限期亦當較短、今則不然、調查團所負使命範圍、甚爲廣大、其任務不僅在於調查某某特定事變之眞相、且爲力謀促進中日關係計、調查團尤當研究事變發生之背景、并考查遠東之一般情勢、蓋必如此、方能了解事變之全部面目也、</p>
<p>此外調查團在調查工作進行中、遭逢重大之難關、而必加以克服、如關係國政府、不論中國或日本、均不能在七月乃至本月初以前將某種重要文件、交與調查團、即其一也、顧調查團所負使命、縱極廣大、調查工作、縱極困難、而其報告書、或仍能於歐洲啓程時所預定之日期内編成、而不至延遲、當調查團從日内瓦出發時、國聯告各團員謂並不希望於八月末或九月初以前、完成報告書、而日内瓦規定之調查團經費預算、亦說明調查團工作時期、於必要時可延長至九個月、國聯大會、依據第十五條審理中日事件時、而欲以調查團依據第十一條所草成之報告書、供其參考、亦屬極近情理、國聯因此乃决定將其審理期限、加以延展、又焉能謂其由於調查團工作之遲緩耶、現在調查團之工作、正照常進行、且依環境之所許、力求其儘速完竣、固未嘗有所遲滯也、大槪在九月初、調查團必可自北平啓程、經西伯利亞而返歐洲云、（哈瓦斯社）</p>

<p>一夜易過、天明即起、八時後我即乘車出城渡江至浦口、乘坐上午十時的特别快車北行至徐州、上車之後、天氣非常炎熱、乘客個個揮汗如雨、十分難受、加以這次所乘改津浦車、名目上雖爲特别快、不論大小、各站都停、時間爲之延長不少、</p>

<p>十一日晨、大雨傾盆、街衢積水殆遍、下午雨勢雖稍殺、仍未停止、天色陰黯、減却人們不少興味、但我們西進工作的勇氣、絕對没有受着絲毫的影響呀、（待續）</p>

<p>專家談話</p>
<h3>馬良談中國新武術</h3>
<p>各國體育各有特點其方式亦各不相侔、中國向無固定方式、余憑數十年之經騐、創爲中華新武術、有中國式的體育運動中華新武術分四項、徒手分拳脚與摔角兩科、兵器分棍與劍兩科、小學學生須學拳脚科、中等以上學校學生及四五十歲以上之人、則學摔角、摔角足以强身體、學理與經騐並重、能與不能、交手卽表現、至於棍、余主張無論男女老少、均須具備一棍、以作防盜術身之用、至劍術最適宜於智識階級、佩劍者尤有紳士風度云、</p>
<h3>國民體育實施方案草案（三）</h3>
<p>乙中學校</p>
<p>（一）塲地—</p>
<p>除减去小學校塲地中之有Ｘ記號者外應加添下列各場地</p>
<p>綱球塲　　　四　約共三萬四千方呎足球塲　　　一　約五萬方呎田徑運動塲　一　約八萬方呎足球塲可包含於田徑運動塲内惟跑道圈不能小於三百米否則將不能包含一足球塲上列塲地爲中學校人數在一百以下者之最低限度百人以上之中學校每百人應加一倍不足五十人可酌加半（但足球塲及田徑運動塲應每三百人加一倍）</p>
<p>校址接近民衆體育塲者、可充分利用民衆體育塲内之田徑運動塲、以减輕學校内田徑運動塲之增添、但校内田徑運動塲之設置不得因公共設備而根本不設、</p>
<p>（二）固定設備——</p>
<p>除减去小學校固定設備中之有Ｘ記號者外應加添下列固定設備、</p>

<h3>丙、大學及學院</h3>
<p>（塲地）——</p>
<p>同中學校但綱球塲應於可能範圍酌量增加</p>
<p>（二）固定設備——</p>
<p>同中學校但中學校固定設備中有Ｘ記號者可酌量減除</p>
<p>（三）消耗設備——</p>
<p>同中學校</p>
<h3>丁、民衆體育場</h3>
<p>（一）塲地——</p>
<p>應同大中小學校應有塲地相加之數、并應劃一部分爲女子運動部、此爲最低限度、如地方人口繁多、參加運動者日衆、應視地方財力酌量增添塲地、尤宜在塲外分區設立兒童游戲塲、今日國内公共體育塲之病不在塲地之不敷而在無具體設施之程序</p>
<p>（二）固定設備——</p>
<p>同大中小學校應有固定設備相加之數、今日國内缺少游泳池應逐漸設置、</p>
<p>（三）消耗設備——</p>
<p>同大中小學校應有消耗設備相加之數</p>
<p>上述各種設備均係室外者體育活動自以盡量於室外舉行爲原則但我國幅員廣大氣候·風沙·雨量·各處不同室内之體育設備亦爲多數區域之所必需、室内運動場之面積無設大中小學校、或民衆體育場、必須至少能容一籃球或一排球場宜視經濟狀况而定至於建築之方式、除經濟多寡外則須視氣候而定、此則各省敎育廳對於本省區域、均應有所研究而詳切規定之、</p>
<h3>（三）經費</h3>
<p>我國在積弱之餘、國民體育亟宜提倡、决無疑義、但數年來國人提倡體育率未有整個之計劃遂呈兩種現象、其一則中央及富庶城市費巨大欵項建築大規模之運動場及辦理各種選手運動會以表揚其提倡之成績其二則内地各處受天災人禍之影響經費支絀體育設施簡陋狀况、幾等於零此二者各趨極　均非眞正提倡之道、富庶之區應不驚虛名、貧困之處應知體育之需要各斟的本地情形以提倡普遍適合國情之體育爲標準、編制相當預算庶可免一方浪擲國帑、一方徒託空言之弊、茲考量各地情形制定各級學校及民衆體育場之經費最低之數目約略如下其中央及地方行政預算須酌情形由主管機關妥爲編製、茲不　焉、</p>
<p>各級學校及民衆體育場購置與修理場地及固定設備之經費應視各種設備在本地購置之價値爲準、各種固定設備消耗設備購置價値各地雖不盡同、会實際相差甚微茲定原則如下、可酌量依比例减少不足十十人者仍以五十人爲準、</p>
<p>民衆體育場到練習者每年四百元、若過此數强依比例增加、</p>
<h3>（四）推行體育方法</h3>
<p>（一）研究工作體育實施材料所採方法、所定標準、經研究之手續、方爲可靠而合時宜、以故研究爲推行體育之第一步工作捨之不講有如盲人瞎馬、恐將誤入歧途甲、研究之機關得有下列數種、</p>
<p>（一）指定一國立大學之體育系爲研究機關其經費得收文化基金會或敎育部補助使添聘研究敎授、</p>
<p>（二）文化基金會設體育講座助某大學體育系生研究工作</p>
<p>（三）指定國内敎育研究及實騐機關添設研究體育部份其經費由敎部津貼之、</p>
<p>（四）選擇模式城鎭及鄉村爲體育實騐區、</p>
<p>（五）國術館</p>
<p>乙、　研究事項</p>
<p>（一）各級男女學校之體育課程前敎育部曾定有高初中及小學之體育課程標準、然未有詳盡之細目編成指定各學校施行實騐獲各圓满結果後再公布採用以後宜請專家厘訂細目、從事试騐</p>
<p>（二）體育考试標準欲謀體育普及須有考試之方法考查全國各學校學生及各民衆體育之成續然因學校之多人民之衆方法務求簡單每人對於各項成續、只求達到某種標準可矣此種標準須由測及統計而來、斷不能武斷定之也、此種標準須經長時間之工作方能成功</p>
<p>會員參觀中崌體育塲（南京光華攝）</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>（三）國術國術之價値派别之異同、敎學及比賽之方法在體育上之地位須由國術家及體育家共同研究通盤計劃、</p>
<p>（四）鄉村體育　事國民衆鄉居有百分之八十五大都務農、有無餘暇從事體育、何種活動合其口味宜實地調查研究、</p>
<p>（五）城中民衆體育收集民間舊有之體育活動改良而提倡、採取外國之民衆體育活動、使適合中國環境變通利用之</p>
<p>（其他）</p>
<p>（二）人材之養成　養成人材之理想機關莫如體育研究機關、如首都之生物研究所國内生物學家由該所養成者不少惟研究機關勢不能多設、而所有人材、非盡研究機關所能養成、故須另訂課程與訓練機關之標準、</p>
<p>甲　體育敎師訓練之課程吾國社會受政治之影響經濟益形竭蹶大學生在校肄業、多年家庭擔負繁重國内各大學體育系學額每難招足、與夫中途退學之多均受經濟之牽掣使然故體育課程須有彈性、使四年之課程分爲兩截首二年注意必修課程後兩年注意選修課程使家境貧寒之學生得中途離校檐任敎科嗣後回校繼續研究、則經騐豐富學習能力增加、所得之知識益能切實茲將課程之分配於下、</p>

<h3>汪宋昨晨同機飛京</h3>
<p>汪表示决不復任行政院長</p>
<p>繼任人選赴廬會商後决定</p>
<p>中央社云、行政院長汪精衛氏、因張學良之辭職問題、業已解决、故於昨晨六時二十五分、偕財政部長宋子文氏、及陳璧君女士、乘塞可斯機返京、詳情錄後、</p>
<h3>離滬時之情形</h3>
<p>行政院長汪精衛氏、於昨晨偕財政部長宋子文氏、乘塞可斯機返京、杭州航空學校校長毛邦初·飛機廠長沈德燮·及師納斯、於昨日淸晨五時半許、先後至虹橋飛機塲、視察並整理飛機機件、汪院長於六時零五分、偕其夫人陳璧君女士、及其秘書李浩駒夫婦至機塲、宋部長則於六時十五分偕財部秘書黄純道至機塲、汪院長夫婦宋部長黄純道李浩駒夫人及納斯等六人、乃先後登機、由毛邦初駕駛、於六時二十五分起飛駛京、預計八時許、即可抵京、</p>
<h3>汪院長之談話</h3>
<p>據汪院長、在機塲語記者、余今晨（即昨晨）返京、即將出席中央常會臨時會、報告此次辭職之原因及經過、如時間許可、今日下午即將偕宋部長赴廬山、晋謁林主席、並晤蔣委員長、面談一切、</p>
<p>▲繼任人選行政院長之繼任人選、余意蔡元培先生爲最宜、余於昨日上午及晚間兩次、訪晤蔡氏、請其出任艱鉅、蔡先生雖表示謙遜、但並不堅辭、此項繼任人選問題、一俟到廬與林主席及蔣委員長等晤商後、即可决定、至本人則决不復職、以免他人有所藉口、</p>
<p>▲政務問題中央政務、並未因此次行政院長辭職而停頓、蓋行政院長辭職、依法可由副院長代理、如副院長不能代理、例由内政部長兼代、或由各部長中推舉一人負責、如昨日（即前日）之行政院會議、即由各部長推舉何部長爲主席、此次宋副院長返京、在行政院長人選未决定以前、依法即須兼代行政院長之職務也、至此次行政院長之更迭各部長當不致變動、蓋依責任内閣制、如政策不能實行、則全體辭職、但决不因行政院長個人之去留而同進退也、但有一二部長早已再三懇辭、或將准其去職也、</p>
<p>▲東北問題封鎖東北海關問題、亦並未因此次行政院長之辭職而停頓、仍在計劃進行之中、外傅日方以大連海關關稅照解爲交換條件、東北海關問題、業已解决說、完全不確、我人目前所抱之主張、正如昔日法國對德國之言曰、「你有本領來取、我絕對不給、」日本來「取、」是一個問題、我人「給、」或「不給、」是另一個問題、日本來「取、」我人必須抵抗、以阻止其「取、」而絕對不「給、」如我人之抵抗不能阻止其「取、」此乃無可如何之事耳、日本來取我國東北之海關、此乃日本之問題、然我人絕對不給、必須抵抗以阻止其取、此乃我之問題也、聞熱河當局、近有摧殘義勇軍之行爲、且僞國警察、業已進佔山海關内三里之土地、此種消息、至爲痛心、蓋我人絕對不能給國土與日人、且須盡力抵抗、以阻止其取也云、</p>
<h3>黃秉衡昨奉召飛廬山</h3>

<h3>海關騐内港貨航商反對甚烈</h3>
<p>上海内港輪船裝載進出口貨、去年裁釐後、槪免徴稅、貨亦免予檢騐、近日江海關忽然宣布對内港貨、均須騐關、並將大達之統稅土布漏騐者、苛關巨欵、引起滬上全體航商之反對、形勢頗爲激昻、茲將此事情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>▲免稅辦法查行駛内港輪向例與民船、同由江海關當開管理報裝之進口貨、向係經南市商輪公會在大達碼頭設騐關房、檢騐手續簡便、而貨物由輪公司代報、彙單呈關查騐、相沿已久、上年六月一日、財部令將五十里常關一律取消、改稱分開、槪免徴稅、進出口貨祗須單報、毋須騐關、一年來航决稱便、</p>
<p>▲騐關新例本年六日二十三日、總稅司諭各内港輪進出貨、統須騐關、出口貨在未騐之前、不得裝船、進口貨在未騐關前、不得預先卸岸、星期日及封關日進口、除牲口鮮貨准予預卸外、其餘各貨、　准卸於俴房、待次日騐關仰各一體遵行、</p>
<p>▲大達罰欵　事實行後、在七月三十日大達公司有第一號鐵駁亨達由通州運來各貨、内有統稅單之土布二百件、上午十一時、有人到亨達查騐、工人船户誤爲關員查騐、且布客因貨擁潮落關係、急欲提去、工人以爲已經騐關、允予提取、下午三時半、海關查騐員始來、方知先來騐者爲統稅局員、而已提去者無法使回、海關認爲違章、卽罰規元二百兩、大達陳述誤會情形、請求免罰未蒙准許、</p>
<p>▲航商反對此次上海内港航輪各公司如振大·大達·大通·聚豐·等全體各航商、經召集會議、僉以内港輪進出口均在當天開行、留停時間至少、進口貨到碼頭、必須趕提、牲口鮮貨、尤易死腐、進口貨騐關、極感困難、如未騐前不准卸岸、事實上殊難辦到、况貨在船艙堆置一處、零亂蕪雜、檢騐需時、且關員祇有一人、而欲查騐多數船舶、甚有至下午三四時始來復騐、勢因騐貨而當日不及結關、船卽不及開行、所受船期損失、究將誰屬、假使下午三四時内進口貨可以騐畢而出口貨已不及趕裝、客貨均停滯欲裝及船不及開、豈非因此轉進退維谷、且查騐僅憑個人意思、初無明文規定、臨時毫無準備、尤感痛苦、</p>
<p>▲呈請取消各航商公函上海航空公會詳述内河進出口貨之騐關事實上殊　辦到且大達駁船持有統稅單之土貨向不騐關已成慣習、而此事又出於誤會、以無須納稅之貨、今海關以一紙布告、不問事體之有無窒礙、航商之能否踐行、卽貿然據以爲斷、且將無須納稅之貨、强議處罰巨金、實苛政猛於虎矣、商人不將人人自危乎、海關方面、利旣未獲、而航商已先受害、豈政府高唱挽回航權提倡航業者所宜出此、事關内港航商切膚之痛、爲此函請航會迅轉江海關、速將内港進出口騐開、立予取消、以利航行、（下略）並聞各航商如不達目的將爲最後之堅决表示</p>
<h3>日海軍昨又到</h3>
<p>▲載來彈藥一批</p>
<p>▲僞國顧問來滬</p>
<p>上海日本海軍陸戰隊、已有二千八百餘名、昨日日本海軍省又從佐世保調派海軍團兵士三百五十名、用運送艦寳户號裝運來滬、昨日上午八時、至楊樹浦大阪碼頭上陸、當即赴虹口海軍陸戰隊本部、派在各隊内補充、此項兵士係調防性質、故明日（十九號）滬上有交替之日本陸戰隊兵士三百名、乘寳户艦開還東洋、今次寳户艦中又載來大批軍火及彈藥、仍卸在大阪碼頭之新棧房内、</p>
<p>满洲僞國當局茲有某項問題、與上海日本軍政當局接洽、特派顧問日人原田俊一、從長春轉大連來滬、昨日已抵上海、原田到滬後、行動甚密、已與矢野會晤、原田在滬住禮查路八號、僞國官吏、以原田爲第一人到上海、</p>
<h3>零售商標明貨物產地</h3>
<p>▲抵制日貨之最好辦法</p>
<p>▲大陸報載一西人投函</p>
<p>昨有西人WalrerC·Youngs君、投函大陸報云、日本喪失在華鉅大市塲後、將因貿易之入超、使其在華軍事冒險、於財政上有不可能之勢、惟激烈與强制之抵制日貨、甚易激生事故、苟以公衆之愛國心理、厲行反對强横國家、則彼最後終必屈服、總之、制人死命之權、操諸最後之用户、而不在批發商與進口商人、不幸今日用户購貨時、多不明貨物之產地、然救濟方法、事甚顯易、且非日本或其他國家所能反對、祗須全國各公會商行與各團體、商定一切零售貨、必須標明原產地、如「美國製造」·「英國製造」·或「日本造製」之類斯時太阿之權、便移歸中國民衆、苟民衆無論以何種理由、不購日本貨物、則可阻止零售商再向批發商續購日貨、於是其他外商便可乘機塡補此種合法抵制所造成之空𨻶、而日本勢將不得不放棄其幻想、彼國際間强盜行爲、今日已非其時、在十九世紀早已被人吐棄矣、</p>
<h3>日商業復興會揣摩奸商心理</h3>

<h3>絞起飛鷹</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>鷹是猛禽！</p>
<p>空中的鐵烏又猛過了你飛鷹！不省得兎死狐悲，物傷其類！却把自已的鐵烏，損害自已的飛鷹！可憐的鷹！沈也麽沈，沈也麽沈，飛鷹變做了潛鱗！吃了你的鷹肉，還了你的鷹骨，也算是做了一個人情！人情是什麽？便是準備絞起和飛鷹。在下胡謅了這麽一首打油詩，附帶還得說明這首詩的本事··粤省爲着海軍事件，把中華民國的飛機，轟沈中華民國的驅逐艦，這是人人以爲很可惜的事！根據粤方消息，此間當局，因該艦價値甚巨，戰鬬力甚强絞起以後，仍擬收回粤用。同時，中央方面，也擬將該艦收管，鞏固海防實力。雙方商議的結果，總算粤方格外情讓，允令沈艦𨽻屬中央，所有絞起的費用，也由中央擔負，不日便由中央派員前往勘視，辦理絞起事宜，云云。吃了你的肉，還了你的骨··這兩句俗語，也成了事實。但是飛鷹沈没已久，將來絞起以後，一把鷹骨頭果能不朽壤否？要是，成了食之無味，棄之可惜的雞肋，又將奈何？無論這隻落湯雞也似的鷹，有用没用，但在粤方當局肯送給中央使用，總算是一分大大的人情了！値得我謅一首歌功頌德的打油詩。</p>
<h3>擊筑感舊錄　絜廬</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>曩讀葉楚傖氏『蒙邊鳴筑記』說不。不禁浮一大白曰。壯哉鐵鷂。洵綠林中之愛國健兒哉。觀其縛僞賣藥人田小吉。　諸革囊。偕阿髯去飲江南生喜酒。直翫狡寇於股掌之上。而被竊之東省秘密地圖。仍還於鐵鷂之手。何其快也。曾幾何時。地圖且已易色。更何被竊之足云。鐵鷂不作。阿髯安在。豈小說家言聊以解嘲矣乎。以余所聞。若老北風·小白龍·王德林諸人。非鐵鷂阿髯之儔乎。客有述黃奴殲敵事者。黃奴·遼西人。傭於狡寇某甲家。已十餘年矣。服務勤敏。得某甲驩。九一八事後。奴事之益謹。甲以相處日久。又以其蠢愚不諳家國事。竟日頣指氣使而不怨。遂不之疑。一日。奴竊得主人銃。突起擊其子女凡六人。遂遁·某甲以事外出。得免於禍云。因憶淸初雲南烏蒙之變。文武多遇害。逆猓猖獗。乘官馬。被將帥戎服。執軍器。肆行無忌。得鼓吹樂人。與使令之役夫。輒釋不殺。令供其事。有義役某者。武職之砲手也。武職死。</p>
<h3>名流軼事</h3>
<p>— ·飯·牛·翁</p>
<p>粤東梁節庵。隴陽易順鼎。侯宮鄭孝胥。爲南皮張文達公之洞。抱冰堂門生。在前淸光緒末葉。張開府兩湖。聲威煊赫時。梁等左右之。一時有三龍之譽。梁爲龍頭。易爲龍腹。鄭爲龍尾。當節署政務餘閒。自公退食。師若弟蕭齋淸話。一榻茶烟。抱冰老人好以詩鐘七唱。酒令山歌爲排遣長日計。詩鐘如林（林黛玉與刀）妃子葬花雙眼淚。丈夫結果一頭顱。（范　與笛）五湖烟水春無價。無里關山月有聲。（扦脚與賣朝報）足下工夫三寸鐵。眼前聲價一文錢。光緒時有小販專印泥版。新上任某省官職。或京官升降事謂之朝報。每紙賣一文。宣統後即不聞市上有此聲喚矣）。（棋與蚊）黑白縱橫敲夜月。晨昏隱約動春雷。（曹操與蟹天下英雄惟我爾。尊前風味有尖團。（消寒圖與春草）榖人小序題伶管。雲伯新詩　六朝。（茶聲與監生）名園花事繁華了。上舍人才俊秀多。（屈原與畫眉鳥）白水投書懷楚客。綠窗啼曉喚張郎。（荷錢與花榜）夏家大少難揮霍。香國名姬入品題。等作。典雅莊諧。兼而有之。藝苑喧傅。洛陽紙貴。三十年來。師弟先後去世矣。祇解元公老不知悟隨傀儡入瀋陽。有愧乃祖板橋居士之之瀟灑多多矣。</p>
<p>被虜。充砲手猓中。猓戰不勝。謀欲施砲。不解施。義役以口向上。猓亦點。怒曰。須向彼。義役詭曰。若然。須别製砲。猓許之。義役於無人處碎其火門。視傍近有藥一桶。持火犇至桶前。猓急禁之不及。火發。桶暴裂。響如雷。山石爲之崩墮。近火之猓悉死。延及十里外。而義役亦燼矣。淸初常履坦醉紅亭集载其事。稱其以一死全滇南百萬生靈。義役之死。爲不死也。於戲。滬戰時之某汽車夫。不惜以已之生命。與敵之砲彈。同盡於浦江之中。亦足與鳥蒙義役。同乘不朽也已。</p>
<h3>美國人與酒</h3>
<p>— 古呆</p>
<p>在美國人之目光中。酒不啻爲第二生命。當禁酒令未頌之前。酒肆之多。實屬無可形容。咖啡座。跳舞座。以及菜館旅社之間。佳釀羅列。固無論矣。即窮鄉僻壞之三家村。亦必有售酒攤。美人好旅行。公餘暇日。輒挈侶駕車郊遊。口渴思飲。恒就而沽酒解渴。然往往因酒性猛烈。致神志昏迷。而肇禍者。至於都市間。則「每飲五分」之市招。於住宅區及工業區間。可十步而一見。此類酒肆。設備簡陋。無桌椅陳設。所有者。僅一長櫃。嗜酒者。納幣五分。即可手把一盞。倚櫃痛飲。納幣十分。可盡兩盞。平民工人之類。率多就此買醉。</p>
<p>酒肆間及一切娯樂塲所。售酒量最多之日。當推星期六午刻。以迄於翌日之淸晨。因美國工人。以及一部分機關中之發薪期。均爲每星期六之上午。辛勤一週之所得者。多有資爲沽飲之用。每杯五分。牛飲無已。旣醉。則嘔去之。而狂飲如故。直至暮靄蒼茫。萬家燈火。或且迄於夜漏更殘。阮囊已盡。則始載舞載歌。踉蹌而賦歸去。妻啼飢。子號寒。不顧也。更有酩酊不能成行。即偃臥孔道。車輪所過。斷肢殘足。屢見而不鮮。故當上次總統競選時。女子之有選舉權者。盡舉胡佛。因胡佛固主張禁酒最力者也。</p>
<p>然自大總統胡佛頒令禁酒後。雷厲風行。宜若可以一舉而禁絕之。以饜一般有嗜酒丈夫的婦女之望矣。實則不然。蓋公開售賣。果不可能。然私釀私販私售者。仍所胡皆是。且以禁令森嚴。故行動均極秘密。欲謀破獲。難之又難。而昔日之日沉浸於麴藥中者。雖夺一二自好者。怵於法律之嚴。不敢輕於嘗試。然以一般而論。則其盛况。仍不减於當年。惟易公開爲秘密耳。故禁酒政策。在美可謂完全失敗。風聞今冬大選。若胡佛不得蟬聯。而爲反對黨所執政。則酒禁勢必重弛。蓋禁酒不特未收寸效。國家反因之减少酒稅之收入也。</p>

<p>日本「航空事情」第九一號轉譯英國「飛機雜誌」所載以下所載，係本社（按係飛機雜誌社自稱）派駐極東通信員寄給「中央，支那郵政」雜誌一封信襄面的話，現在把他抄在下面。</p>
<p>「醒醒罷支那！請你醒轉來罷！</p>
<p>不論什麽事情，但凡到了支那人手襄實行行起來時，就顯出你是天下最最無能的國家了。」最近我第二次參觀漢口飛行塲的時候。失望之餘，不禁發出了如上的一段話。航空郵政，剏辦了亦已有兩年的歷史，當初的飛行塲，理想中必然有相當的改善，而孰知不但没有這回事，支那官廳，不啻天天在自已拆自已的台，這怎得了？郵政飛機，依然在那一片又汚穢又雜亂的飛行塲的一角襄飛起來，停下來，飛機間（按謂安置飛機的庫房）依然和那些軍用飛機亂七八糟的塞在裏面，最妙者，飛機間的外面，竟有許多壞了機械的，破了機身的，破舊廢爛的飛機，如「小山一座」般堆棄在那裏，也没有人管他的閒賬，這種情形，那怕最最没有心肝的旅客見了，恐怕亦要嚇一大跳，驚得吐出舌頭伸不回來。</p>
<p>一處汚穢得像猪圈狗窠一般的兵舍裏，有一到晚什麽事亦不幹，穿着了呌化子般服裝的大兵一隊，蹲在那裏。</p>
<p>一半浸在小裏的大道上，有兩個哨兵用的天幔，莫明其妙的橫七竪八倒在那裏尤其令人憤憤者，那地方居然放出了步哨，但是一没有規律，二没有法則，倘使旅客要想通過這地方，到他目的物的飛機停留地方去，休想隨便通得過，你如把這種意思同他們說明時，他們又茫然不懂，非常吃力，這好像步哨究竟負折什麽任務，凶官長從來並没有敎給他似的，那麽設置这步哨，究竟用意何在？實在又是莫明其妙。</p>
<p>這偌大的一片廣塲以外，並没有爲軍隊，旅客着想，設備一個便所，因此久而久之　四面八方到處可以發見盡是尿屎。</p>
<p>衡量郵政信件，或行李等件的重量起見，固然也有一架似秤非秤的秤，擺在那裏爲過磅之用，但是看他這形狀，就會得令人起一種「斷難精確」之疑。像上面所說的這種管理方法，所以亦莫怪停機塲屢次髪　如泥海一般，到了現在，簡直成了一個湖面了·，我曾親眼看見一架飛機，在起飛的時候，竟將泥水帶起有十五英尺之高，弄得乘客的身上，坐椅上，行李上，满濡着爛汚泥漿，衋都成了泥人，起飛的時候總試行離地四五次之多，每起飛一次，要拖泥帶水一回。這次好像飛得起來了，不料却又中止了，還得重來過一次，你想乘客吃得消吃不消呢？</p>
<p>醒醒罷支那！要是你眞有想要振興航空事業的常識的話，那末老是這樣是不行的，希望你建築一個適當的好飛行塲，使用那可以維持這事業的常識爲妙！你試睜開你那尊眼，看一看目下怎樣把飛機和乘客在那襄胡攪！再看一看究竟有無被那没用的兵士，妨害你那事業的情事！以證明我的話是否寃枉。至於兵士，現在順帶說一點意見，雖不在本題範圍以内，與其耗費國家有用的金錢，豢養這種像老鷄般隻脚獨立，罹「僂麻質斯」病的兵士，（按「僂麻質斯」係一種足以妨害「操縱航空器」之病症卽瘋癱也原文蓋極形容其畸形而已）不如把來用之於水浸兵舍裏的排水工程好些。「加那大」人說話善於失言，請恕我罷！</p>
<p>按此篇係日本雜誌，轉譯英國雜誌而來，形容挖苦，達於極點，讀之愧汗直流，頓使人喜歡研究航空之心情，减夫十分，爲欲使大衆普遍明瞭外人對我航空係如何一種之批評起見，特不惜在職務百忙之中，更由日誌轉譯成此，以供大家出身冷汗，惟日譯者原註，亦種「事實之眞僞不明，想未必若斯之甚，」而以鄙意度之，或通信適當漢口大水災後，闪往參觀，無怪其有如此現象也，聽禪又識</p>

<h3>考學堂</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>提起考學堂，又要使我難過了，前天我算的一篇兒女讀書賬，如一個學生，讀到國内大學畢業，必須費銀四千元，現在說考學堂，就是拿了金錢，還没有好的學堂去讀書。眞是可憐呢？</p>
<p>内地的學堂，往往辦得不好，程度較低，這是無可諱言的事實，上海學堂，比較完備，所以住居上海的，天然把子女送入上海學堂肄業，就是住居内地的，也不恤一批一批遣送子女到上海來留學，但是到了上海，去考那一隻學堂呢？困難問題就此發生了，比較各譽好些内容完備的學堂，其實上海亦非常之少，即有幾只比較著名的學堂，欲去投考，非常之難，缺額有限，而投考的格外擁擠，假定缺額祗有一百名，而投考者往往有千餘人之多，若欲考取該項學校，比較科舉時代考個秀才還難。</p>
<p>於是有與校長先生相識的，請求校長通融，有與敎員相識的，請求敎員先生代爲道地，直接不相識，於是托人間接相法，如是輾轉請扥，費盡心機，倖而目的得達，終算繳天之倖，大呼恭喜，萬一額满見遣，孫山名落，難道把子女留在家中不使他讀書麽？不得已而思其次，再揀名譽較次的學堂，前往投考，而名譽較次的學堂，也联容易，於是照樣請托他人，代爲設法，萬一目的再不達如何，只有把子女往一般野鷄式學堂裏去送，</p>
<p>好在這種野鷄式折學店，非常之多，猶如馬路上的烟紙店，可說條條馬路多有，他們的宗旨，原是韓信將兵，多多益善，其惟一的好處，就祗認票不認人，祗要你學費遵章繳納，你們來讀書也可，你們不來讀書更可，他們的優點有幾種，我可約略言之。</p>
<p>一·放假比較來得多，（因爲多放一天假，可以多扣一天的飯錢。）</p>
<p>一·敎員請得蹩脚，（校長精括，敎薪照十月計算，如不满一月，還要照鐘點計算，所以好敎員不肯去。）</p>
<p>一·學堂課程馬虎，（部章規定的學科，天然不能缺少，章程儘管堂皇，學課不妨淺就，或者史地敎師兼敎英文，或英文敎師兼授他種學課，通融辦理。）</p>
<p>一·學堂無秩序（這種野鷄式的學店，天然最怕閙風潮，或者被學生出去說壤話，所心對於學生，不敢認眞一些。）</p>
<p>他們的優點，筆難盡述，我僅略舉其四，不過從這學堂畢業出來，又是一個困難問題，小學堂畢業要考好的中學，不取，中學堂畢業，要考好的大學又不取，於是野鷄式的小學畢業出來，只得考野鷄式的中學，野鷄式中學出來，只得考野鷄式折大學，這種學生，始終混在這種野鷄式的學店裏做個學徒，將來成就了一個野鷄式的大學畢業生，這是何等可憐的事呢？</p>

<h3>最新式的冷氣裝置</h3>
<p>— 白匋</p>
<p>近來各大電影院以及大旅社都以最新式的冷氣裝置相號召，新式的冷氣裝置究竟是一個什麽樣的東西呢？諒來是讀者諸君們所願意知道的吧。</p>
<p>新式冷氣裝置中的電氣冷却裝置，實在是近代家庭中啊新式的冷却法。但牠所應用的科學原理，却異常簡單。大家都知道水在普通的情形之下，是要熱到華氏溫度計上二百十二度才會沸騰的，但在眞空中或地面的高處，就是很低</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>的溫度也會沸騰。在眞空器中，水不必用火煑就沸騰了。水一旦沸騰之後就蒸發得很快，那就是說水都變成看不見的氣體了！在這時候，牠要吸收多量的熱。你用水洗身體，身體潮濕後就覺得很爽快，那就是因爲你身上的水蒸發而爲氣體的時候，將你身體上的熱帶走了許多，所以你覺得凉快。電氣冷却裝置就是運用這個道理造出來的。</p>
<p>冷却器中有一個極高的眞空器，是用喞筒將器中空氣抽盡而成。這眞空器能使液體在底溫度中即蒸發，而使牠用着極快的速度蒸發而爲水蒸氣，吸收空氣中多量的熱。於是，將這氣體通過管中流入一個凝結器裏面，這器裏面包括一組的冷却裝置（水池，蜂巢形的輻射器，電扇等等，）使水蒸氣凝結而爲水，從另一根管子裏水又復流入蒸發器中，如此循環不已。</p>
<p>那喞筒和扇統統是用發電機來工作的，所以呌做電氣冷却裝置。</p>
<p>新近有一種更新式的冷氣裝置是用氣熖的！這熖並不是火熖，而是一種冰凍樣的冷氣！這種冰凍樣的冷氣，能使淸凉劑蒸發，結果收回熱和噴出來的冷水，仍然從氣體變成液體。這新式的冷氣裝置，不需要電氣發動機。</p>
<p>滬上近來有此項新式冷却裝置的已不少，每當　署熏人，置身其聞，當能忘却不少暑意。</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3>倡辦託兒所的提議</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>本討論會自舉行討論以來，當然有些問題，也許是相當切要的，在「改良」的範圍中，已是儘可能的做到了。吾不敏，很少參加討論，只是在每天讀報的時間中看看熱閙··這樣，自問是没有完成每一個會員所應盡的責任，然而與其言不由衷，不如緘默毋言，如此，似乎對於吾個人的修養乃是相當有益的。但是現在吾有了破除緘默的成見，即是我準備在這裏提出一個比較切實的問題。</p>
<p>本來，有許多問題是要在另一種社會中才能將得着解决，即是說某種社會中其經濟和政治機械已有了根本的改換，有許多在現實社會中不能獲得解决的問題·亦必因其經濟期礎之改換而完全解决。然而亦有少數問題即在現實社會中也可得着相當的改善，雖然這僅有的改善乃是十分不夠，但是到底可因這「改善」而在將來偉大的「改造」中安置一塊基石。那末，以下的提議，也許是有相當的意義了。</p>
<p>有許多留心社會病態的先生們，不是常「嘆息」着男女不平等嗎？有許多受過相當敎育的太太們不是常以爲老站在政治圈外而引爲遺憾嗎？有許勞苦的婦女們不是常因爲不能從事生產而受着男性的欺凌嗎？固然這都是在中國所特有的畸形和政治狀態之下，所必然發生的結果，然而兒女對於母親的覊絆亦爲婦女解放之最大的阻碍。</p>
<p>四千年的歷史賜予了婦女們一個最大的信心，兒女成行，乃是母親們最大的福德，可是同時亦註定了母親之終身命運，即是從此爲兒女作牛馬，自身的一切，完全寄託於兒女的成長和繁榮中。那末在生理上凡是女性一定會生孩子，生了孩子一定得撫養成長，而且撫育的任務，也似乎祗有婦女纔能肩任，因之這簡直是不成間題的問題了，可是不然。吾以爲假如有了託兒所的設立，對於母親與兒女的關係，至少可以減少許多茲從各方矶分别申述之如下··</p>
<p>（一）有了託兒所的組織，婦女們可因之減除家庭的負擔而從事解放運動，以求得政治上經濟上的平等。</p>
<p>（二）婦女們不致因兒女的覊縛而站在政治圈外或落後政治水準。</p>
<p>（三）勞働婦女們可直接參加生產而謀經濟上之獨立，並減輕丈夫的負擔。</p>
<p>（四）由於這種組織之發展可使一部份的婦女得着適合的職業（服務於託兒所）</p>
<p>（五）兒童可由科學的撫育法而使身體健全。</p>
<p>（六）兒童可習慣於集團生活而受着良好的兒童敎育。自然，先有了身體健全敎育完善的兒童，才有民族發展的前途。</p>
<p>以上是說明其創設託兒所之意義。至於如何創立，如何設備，當非一人之見解所能及，自非羣策羣力不爲功。關於這點，謹希望高明的會員們不吝指敎，而得以完善的實現起來。</p>
<p>最後還有一附帶的聲明··此項計劃，已有某夫人在積極的使其實現，然因經費和人材的缺乏，一時或不能完成，因此，除在此企圖引起熱烈的討論外，並爲某夫人向社會人士呼鑰，籲諸同道者加以有力的援助。</p>
<p>家　向題</p>
<h3>一個比鄰「書寓」的家庭</h3>
<p>— 偉</p>
<p>有一家世家陳公館的比鄰，就是一座書寓··是海上最有名的紅姑娘，每當更深午夜的時候，裏頭燈紅酒綠，人語花香，這便脂汚粉穢骨蝕塊銷的人間地獄！但是比鄰的，却是一個ＸＸ校長的住宅，性很謙和，有彬彬君子的遺風，伊只有一個女兒呌貞淑，是一個未知世故的小女兒，生性活潑，品貎端好，而陳先生因爲鄰居是書寓，所以常常把古代女子的忠孝節烈的故事，細细地講着她聽，好敎她永久的念念不忘這好的禮敎，可是近墨者黑，那整夜的歡笑聲，喜邪聲，和紅姑娘的妖形怪狀的衣裳，把貞淑的一片雪白的素心，沾着了汚點，</p>
<p>以後五六年，陳先生見他女兒的一舉一動，都變了模樣，窑子裏書寓裏的耳濡目染，把陳先生的十多年的家庭敎育，一筆勾消，時常見她放學回來的時候，着意了效法妓女的打扮，學會了打情駡俏的醜態，居然唱起來四季相思和打牙牌的小調來，她的父親氣恨已極的鬱鬱而死了！</p>
<p>從此貞淑愈形放蕩形骸地亂做，有人從蘇州回來講起說！闖門外的阿黛橋，多乃一家明艶獨一的陳好好了！在金閶亭畔要獨佔花魁的第一人了！</p>
<p>她畢竟墮落了！她的墮落在··「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」的一個「近」字！</p>
<p>笑話</p>
<h3>鄉下人不識西文</h3>
<p>— 抄辰</p>
<p>鄉間孩子，新自學校中放署假回家，朗誦英文拼法云，「皮意皮」「皮屋爬」反覆誦此二語可百餘遍，門外適走過一冬烘學究，聞而歎曰，是孩也，可謂明書理者矣，彼云，「皮衣敝」「敝而罷」此即論語所云「衣輕裘敝之而無憾」之意，皮衣敝，言皮裘已破也，敝而罷，言皮裘已破，便即罷休，無須懷恨也，少頃，一流氓阿大過門，聞而大怒曰，是孩可惡，彼以我爲惡霸，而欲與吾避面，口口聲聲欲云「避一避」「避惡霸」出言不孫，我須與之理論，少頃，又有一歪嘴阿二過門，聞而冷笑曰，是孩也，竟敢取笑我歪嘴耶，明知我是下扒歪斜，乃欲與我相比，而云，「比一比」「比下扒」促狹甚矣，少頃，又有一啞喉嚨阿三過門，聞而忿之曰，是忒煞欺人，笑我喉音太低，稍變便成啞吧，曰「變一變」「變啞吧」彼我何仇，而乃咒我爲啞吧耶，於是流氓阿大，歪嘴阿二啞喉嚨阿三相率入門，欲飽孩子以老拳，幸冬烘先生搶步入門，爲之引證書句，解釋誤會，孩子乃免於危，</p>

<h3>The People's Hearts Have Not Died - Original</h3>
<p>People say our science is inferior to others, our material civilization is inferior to others, and our firearms and equipment are inferior to others. I bow my head and admit it. But if you say our love for our country is inferior to others, or our understanding of universal principles is inferior to others, then I swear I cannot admit it even unto death. Our people know that our firearms and equipment are inferior to others, so sometimes we swallow our anger and willingly submit to violent force. Only when we can no longer endure will we not hesitate to sacrifice everything, shed our blood, and destroy our homes to jointly face national disasters. Just look at the Japanese army forcibly occupying Liaoning and Shenyang, and Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, and others rising up in resistance because they could no longer endure it. The Japanese army forcefully attacked Shanghai, and Cai Tingkai and others rose up in resistance because they could no longer endure it. Pu Yi organized a puppet government, and the various volunteer armies of the Northeast rose up in attack because they could no longer endure it. This is one proof that the love for our country has not been extinguished and the universal principles have not been forgotten by our people. Every time Ma, Du, Cai, and the various volunteer armies perform a righteous and heroic act, our entire society applauds and cheers, and donates and assists, fearing only that they are too late. Even young students and powerless laborers travel thousands of miles, carrying baskets and burdens to comfort them. Is this not another proof that the love for our country has not been extinguished and the universal principles have not been forgotten by our ordinary people? Now, the detention of the patriotic Shanghai youth Yun Huifang has caused the people of the country to feel regret. There are more than a hundred groups who are trying to rescue him. On the day of his bail, various groups competed to provide guarantees. When he was released from the hospital, the cheers were deafening. Conversely, when the traitor Hu Lifu from Zhabei was detained, everyone cheered. Various groups petitioned for severe punishment, and ten thousand people spat and cursed him. Is this not another proof that the love for our country has not been extinguished and the universal principles have not been forgotten by our ordinary people? The patriotic actions of Yun are an example of the patriotic actions of resisting Japan by Ma, Du, and Cai, etc., but the matter seems very small. The traitorous behavior of Hu is an example of the traitorous behavior of Zheng Xiaoxu, Xi Qia, and others who supported the puppet organization, and it seems very slight. However, the expressions of our people towards these two matters are to give the utmost protection and respect to one, and the utmost hatred and indignation to the other. It can be seen that the love of our people for our country and the adherence to universal principles are lurking everywhere and can be expressed anywhere, and are not just occasional and rootless. I have two feelings about this.</p>
<p>First. Our people have this heart of loving the country and upholding universal principles, and we only need to persevere in implementing them, without seeking to be known by others. Do not be angry if people ridicule us as a mob. We only need to seek to avoid being a mob ourselves. Do not be angry if people ridicule us as a country without right or wrong. We only need to seek to understand right and wrong without violating universal principles. Our patriotic actions are not intended to show off to others. Our upholding of universal principles is also not intended to boast. We only seek to achieve our goal of saving the country. Whether people know it or not is irrelevant to us and irrelevant to the facts of what we do. Everyone should only seek to implement patriotism without seeking to be known by others. This is called true patriotism. Everyone should only seek to implement the upholding of universal principles without seeking to be known by others. This is called truly upholding universal principles. This is the first meaning.</p>
<p>Second. Our people have this heart of loving the country and upholding universal principles, but we cannot limit ourselves to this and must develop and expand it. Do not be moved by threats or inducements. Do not retreat from hardships and difficulties. Do not neglect small difficulties, and do not fear great difficulties. Do not go beyond our scope because of temporary anger, and do not neglect our original aspirations because of long delays. The unity must be firm. Do not suspect each other because of occasional internal opinions. The purpose must be clearly recognized. Do not waver because of changes in the environment. All of our people must hold this common purpose, with a strong and unyielding spirit, to save the country in unison, and never weaken. Only then can we achieve the final result. This is the second meaning.</p>
<p>The heart of loving the country has not been extinguished. Universal principles have not been forgotten. This means that the hearts of our people have not died. If the hearts of our people do not die for a day, then our country can be saved for a day.</p>

<h3>Central Government Held Extraordinary Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei Reports on the Reasons for Resigning as President of the Executive Yuan; The Central Government, Concerned About the Difficulties Facing the Nation, Decides to Persuade Him to Stay; The Decision on Whether to Stay Will Be Made After Wang Meets with Lin and Chiang to Discuss; Wang Plans to Fly to Lushan Today with Song Ziwen and Others (Nanjing); The Extraordinary Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Executive Committee was held at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th at the First Conference Hall of the Central Party Headquarters. The meeting was attended by committee members Ye Chucang, Wang Zhaoming, Chen Guofu, Zhu Peide, Ju Zheng, Song Ziwen, Gu Mengyu, Zhu Jiahua, Shao Yuanchong, He Yingqin, Wu Jingheng, Chen Bijun, Chu Minyi, Chen Gongbo, Chen Lifu, Chen Shuren, Tang Youren, Shi Ying, Wang Luyi, Ding Chaowu, Shi Qingyang, Mao Zuquan, Bai Yunti, Duan Xipeng, Zeng Zhongming, and 38 others. Ye Chucang chaired the meeting. Wang Zhaoming reported on the reasons for resigning as President of the Executive Yuan. His words were sincere, but all the committee members believed that for the sake of careful consideration, Committee Member Wang should go to Lushan on the 18th to consult with Chairman Lin and Committee Member Chiang before returning to Beijing to report. Another extraordinary meeting will be held next week to make a decision. (Special Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei reported on the reasons for resigning as President of the Executive Yuan at the Central Standing Committee's extraordinary meeting. He first stated that he had been appointed to a difficult situation on January 28th, originally hoping to do his best to implement the fundamental goal of resisting Japan and saving the country. However, six months have passed, and things have gone against his wishes. He has achieved nothing and feels deeply guilty. Subsequently, he gave a general report on financial problems, mainly comparing the national taxes submitted by various provinces to the central government with the central government's military and administrative expenditures and the coordination of loans borne by various provinces. The discrepancy was significant, and it was difficult to cope with. He then reported on diplomatic and other important issues. Next, he described the course of the Zhang Xueliang issue in detail. He provided a very detailed explanation of Zhang's statement in Ping and the correspondence between them. Finally, he expressed that the intent of his resignation was by no means the so-called defeatism. He asked the Central Committee to recognize his sincerity and find a replacement candidate. After resigning as President of the Executive Yuan, he would continue to be responsible for the affairs of the Central Political Council. If the Central Committee wanted to entrust him with any difficult task, he would work hard for the country and would not refuse. Subsequently, Wu Jingheng, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, and others spoke successively, mainly stating that the country was in a difficult situation and that the administrative center relied on Mr. Wang to take charge and jointly maintain the difficult situation. It was not easy to change. The Central Committee, considering the difficulties facing the nation and bowing to public opinion, decided to persuade him to stay. Wang then repeatedly stated his sincere intention to resign, expressing his determination.

After receiving Chiang's telegram, he decided to stay in Beiping temporarily and replied to Chiang's telegram, saying that he was waiting for his arrival in Beiping. However, after consultation, he still intended to take a trip abroad. Chiang also replied to the telegram expressing his gratitude and said that he planned to come to Beiping as soon as possible, but the date could not be determined in advance.

<h3>Luo Wengan Issues a Declaration to the Outside World</h3>
<p>Japan Sends Ambassador Plenipotentiary to Manchuria</p>
<p>Clearly a Preliminary Step Towards Formal Recognition</p>
<p>Countries Cannot Remain Indifferent</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding Japan's notification to the League of Nations of the dispatch of Muto as Ambassador Plenipotentiary to Manchuria, Foreign Minister Luo issued the following declaration on the 17th: "The Japanese government, ignoring the protests of the Chinese government and the criticism of world opinion, brazenly dispatched Muto as Ambassador Plenipotentiary to Manchuria and formally notified the League of Nations. This action is clearly a preliminary step towards formal recognition, in order to achieve its ultimate goal of annexing Manchuria. However, Japan still wants to conceal the eyes and ears of the world and sophistically argued to the League of Nations that Muto's visit to Manchuria is not that of an ordinary ambassador, and that he will not present his credentials, but is sent to supervise Japanese consulates. Manchuria is a puppet created by Japan, and it is believable that the ambassador sent to the puppet it created is not an ambassador in the ordinary sense. It is natural that he does not need to present his credentials. As for the claim that Muto is sent to supervise Japanese consuls, if Japan does not recognize Manchuria as an independent country, then the responsibility of supervising Japanese consuls in the three northeastern provinces naturally falls on Arata Ariyoshi, the newly appointed Japanese ambassador to China. Japan's invasion of our Northeast, on the one hand, is deceived by the sweet words of Japanese diplomats, and on the other hand, it is directly admitted by the Japanese military authorities, repeatedly stating that Japan's dispatch of an ambassador to Manchuria is the completion of de facto recognition, and that formal recognition will be implemented when the time is ripe. This shows its true intention. If the countries of the world want to tacitly recognize Japan's recognition of the puppet organization of Manchuria as legitimate, then they must not remain indifferent to Japan's dispatch of an ambassador to Manchuria." (Special Telegram, 17th)</p>
<h3>Experts Discuss Blocking Northeast Telecommunications</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The traffic authorities are gathering experts to discuss the plan to block Northeast telecommunications. After implementation, the authorities will evaluate whether it will have an impact on the facts and whether it will be enough to resist the Japanese invasion, and whether it will create opportunities for the Japanese to carry out telecommunications on the South Manchuria Railway and the Shanghai-Nagasaki underwater line. At present, the methods proposed by various experts amount to dozens of articles. After the results have been studied, the Ministry of Communications will submit them to the Executive Yuan and forward them to the Central Political Council for discussion and approval.

<h3>Harbin to Build a Long Embankment</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The water level here has only receded by one inch. According to experts, the water outside Blistan, a suburb, cannot be discharged until the river water level drops further. At the same time, the river water level upstream is still rising. There are plans to build an embankment one mile long to prevent the city river water from flowing in. Public opinion is that if the embankment is not built, it will take a month to remove the sewage and accumulated water from Blistan. The water level in Fuzijadian may not recede quickly, and the flooded areas may be uninhabitable this winter. The Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau is working hard to protect the Harbin Bridge to maintain train traffic, placing crushed stones around the bridge foundation every day, but the fate of the bridge is still very precarious. International relief organizations are appealing to the League of Nations for relief funds. The plague is still raging, with over a hundred new cases every day. According to refugee reports tonight, two bridges on the Chinese Eastern Railway main line and thirty small bridges have been washed away. Reportedly, twenty road bridges west of Mao'ershan City and five road bridges east of it have been completely destroyed. The damage within Yimianpo is also severe. It will take a month to repair after the water recedes to restore the roadbed.

Residents were unable to escape and thousands drowned. Former land can now be navigated by boats. Steamships can pass through without obstruction. The depth of the water is evident.

<h3>India's Political Participation Stipulates Allocation Methods</h3>
<p>British Prime Minister Issues Statement</p>
<p>Indian Elections Adopt Ethnic Separate Election System</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 16th: The British government today unanimously decided on a method to handle India's ethnic issues. Prime Minister MacDonald has issued a statement that elections will adopt an ethnic separate election system. However, Hindus in Madras Province, United Province, Bihar and Orissa Province, and Central Province have an absolute majority of seats. Hindus will also dominate in Mumbai and Assam, while Muslims will have a majority of seats in the Northwest Frontier Province and a majority in Mengzhebu. Although Muslims in Bengal have more seats than Hindus, they do not have an absolute majority. The government statement stated that various ethnic groups in India have repeatedly tried to solve the problem on their own but have failed to reach an agreement with each other. Therefore, the government is undertaking the task of solving this problem, as it will ultimately be an obstacle to constitutional development if it is not resolved. British Prime Minister MacDonald's statement on the Indian incident stated that the government has not yet abandoned the hope that Indians can independently establish an agreement. Therefore, the scope of the current plan is limited and only applicable to provincial councils. The precedents for political participation in the Central Council will be considered in the future. Unless it is endorsed by all parties concerned, the British government does not want to participate in negotiations to amend its own plan, nor does it want to consider any amendments. The constitution will stipulate that the Parliament Act can be amended after ten years, but it must be with the consent of those concerned. On the issue of separate elections, the British government feels that it cannot abolish the necessary safeguards for minorities. Therefore, Hindus, Muslims, oppressed ethnic groups, Sikhs, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians, and Europeans in each province all have their own constituencies. In addition, women, industry, academia, labor, and landlords also have special constituencies. However, this method varies depending on the circumstances of each sector. For example, Sikhs only have members in Mengzhebu and the Northwest Frontier Province, while Europeans and the Labor Party have no members in the frontier provinces. Muslims have a unique number of people in the two provinces of Mengzhebu and Bengal, so they also have greater political participation. Mengzhebu has 175 seats, and Muslims occupy 86 seats. Although it is not an absolute majority, Muslims can still occupy three landlord seats and three special seats. Therefore, in fact, Muslims can appropriately obtain more than half. Sikhs are a powerful minority in Mengzhebu Province and will have 32 seats and may obtain one special seat. Therefore, Sikhs account for 1.3% of the population but account for 18.9% of political participation. Muslims have 111 seats out of 250 seats in Bengal Province and can obtain several special seats. Therefore, Muslims do not obtain more than half of the seats in Bengal Province, and the holders of the balance of power are 25 Europeans. Oppressed ethnic groups have special treatment. These ethnic groups are Hindus of the lower class. It is said that they should be given special political participation to improve their situation and abolish the evil habit of "not contacting outsiders." They will vote in ordinary Indian constituencies. As for women's political participation, 37 seats are currently stipulated. Although the women's community wants to have political participation, it does not require preferential treatment. The British government recognizes the importance of having at least a small number of female members in the new parliament. Therefore, a certain number of female seats are specified. However, female members may not be selected from one ethnic group. Therefore, except for the Northwest Frontier, each province has female constituencies, with a total of 37 female seats: 25 for Hindus, 1 for Sikhs, 9 for Muslims, and 1 each for Indian Christians and Anglo-Indians. The Labor Party occupies 38 seats in the provincial council. According to the current system, there are only 9 seats. British Prime Minister MacDonald said that the above method is quite fair and can balance the disputes of all parties and is a feasible method. Indians must be aware that they have repeatedly failed to propose concrete methods. This kind of problem can only be solved by Indians themselves. It is hoped that the Indian people will each recognize that ethnic cooperation is a condition for progress and seek the implementation of the new constitution. The cabinet is currently considering the second step, which will likely continue to be discussed in London to draft a complete proposal for the law of the Indian constitution proposed by the government.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 17th: General public opinion regards India's ethnic election methods as appropriate mediation and well-researched plans to favor minorities. However, it is doubtful whether this plan can be accepted by all parties.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Simla, 17th: After the publication of the Indian political participation allocation plan, Indians have different opinions on it, supporting and opposing it. Muslims and Europeans have expressed satisfaction, while Hindus and Sikhs have strongly criticized it. Spokespersons for oppressed ethnic groups have pointed out that the number of special seats given to oppressed ethnic groups is too small and have advised all oppressed classes to strive for freedom.</p>
<h3>Germany Will Negotiate Disarmament Directly with France</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 16th: Germany is about to negotiate disarmament issues directly with France. If there are still no results, it is prepared to abolish the arms restrictions in the Treaty of Versailles. According to General Schleicher, the Minister of National Defense, who revealed some clues during a radio speech a few days ago, other countries are unwilling to reduce their armaments to the same extent as Germany, and Germany is preparing to reorganize its armed forces. It is reported that the German government intends to start negotiations with the French Ambassador, Ponce, immediately in order to revise the military provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. The date is approximately in the middle of next week. Germany will demand: (1) that France's twelve-year military service period be reduced to six years; (2) that all German factories have the right to manufacture munitions. Because the Council of Ambassadors' agreement only designated 33 German factories to manufacture a fixed amount of munitions, the Germans are currently eager to first remove this layer of restrictions.</p>
<h3>German Social Democratic Party Striving to Seize Power</h3>
<p>Rumors of Stormtroopers Concentrating Near Berlin</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 17th: The leader of the Berlin Brownshirts, Hieldorf, declared that in a few weeks, the result of the political situation will surely enable the National Socialist Party to seize power. Hieldorf also announced to the entire army that stormtrooper members will all be given leave until August 28. All leave will be canceled on the due date.</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, Berlin, 17th: According to reliable sources, rumors of Hitler's stormtroopers concentrating near Berlin have resurfaced. In some areas, Hitler's party members seem to have been ordered to prepare fully armed within 48 hours. National Socialist Party members are now indeed disturbed.</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, Berlin, 17th: National Nationalist members of the Prussian Parliament have declared to the Papen cabinet that if the federal government and the Prussian state government decide to form a cabinet in the capacity of a "presidential cabinet," they will support it with all their strength. National Nationalists demand that experts form a permanent government of Prussia. However, there are still rumors in political circles that there may be a compromise between the Prussian Central Party and the National Socialist Party. Some even say that the compromise between the two parties will be successful by the end of this week. The Central Party will cede the position of Prime Minister of the Prussian cabinet to the National Socialist Party, while retaining the position of Minister of Interior for the current Prussian Deputy Commissioner, Blarett, who belongs to the Central Party.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 17th: Hitler stated in his newspaper that he did not predict the tolerance of the Papen government. Therefore, he has not broken his word. He also stated that in the negotiations in Berlin, he did not demand to seize all of Germany's power. It is estimated that the German government will announce its denial of Hitler's declaration tomorrow.</p>
<h3>German Government Planning to Relieve Unemployment</h3>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, Berlin, 17th: It is rumored that the German government will issue a compulsory labor service system. Young workers who reach a certain age must declare their willingness to register for employment before they can receive unemployment benefits.</p>
<h3>End Date of British Economic Conference to be Postponed</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Ottawa, 17th: The issue of Russian goods being dumped in the British Empire market and the preferential treatment of Australian meat are now delaying the end date of the British Empire Economic Conference. Some newspapers say that Britain cannot agree to the meat and food incident proposed by Australia and New Zealand, and the dumping of Russian wood proposed by Canada. Therefore, the future of the British Empire is currently hesitating on the road. It is heard that the real key point is Australia's request for Australian meat imports to be given more preferential treatment than Argentinian meat imports. The discussion yesterday was extremely confidential. It is heard that Canada and others strongly advocated restrictions on Russian goods entering the UK. As for other matters, there is more progress. An agreement beneficial to Canadian fisheries can be established. The details are not yet known, but the preferential tariff will increase from 10% to 20%. It is verified that the foreign countries affected by this will be the Soviet Union, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, and Portugal.</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, London, 17th: A newspaper revealed that Britain and the Soviet Union have a trade agreement. This trade agreement still has six months of validity. During this period, all laws and regulations on curbing exploration and production policies, including those decided at the Ottawa Conference, will be invalid. After this news was disclosed, all sectors were very surprised. British political circles declared that since the signing of the Anglo-Russian provisional trade agreement in April 1930, no treaty has been signed with Soviet Russia. However, this temporary trade agreement will continue to be valid until a new agreement is signed.</p>
<h3>Romania and Russia Prepared to Sign Non-Aggression Treaty</h3>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, Romanian Capital, 17th: Today, Parliament questioned the signing of the non-aggression treaty between Poland and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Wei Da replied, "According to international practice, ongoing diplomatic actions must not be discussed." The reply only stated that the day after the signing of the "Polish-Russian Treaty," the document issued by the Romanian government had already explained that after the establishment of peaceful relations between Poland and Russia, Romania and its ally Poland would continue to maintain close friendship. Romania signed the Litvinov Protocol in 1929 (i.e., the protocol stipulating that Eastern European countries implement the non-war convention in advance), and later ratified the non-war convention. According to Stimson's recent interpretation, this non-war convention proves that it is not a declaration of good faith, but a treaty with obligations. In the Litvinov Protocol, the Soviet Union's signature is ranked first, declaring that the non-war convention guarantees peace between countries from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. It can be seen that the nature of the non-war convention is no different from a non-aggression treaty. Romania is currently preparing to sign a non-aggression treaty, but it must reserve Romania's legitimate interests.</p>
<h3>Bolivia's Statement to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Geneva, 17th: Bolivian representative Leers sent a document to the League of Nations Secretariat, vigorously denying that Bolivian troops occupied the Calosantu Niuro Lopez Fort and that Paraguayan troops recaptured it. He also stated that on August 9, Paraguayan troops attacked the Bolivian base of Teyerina Xushu, hoping to provoke the Bolivian army to counterattack. The purpose of this move was clearly to promote the anti-Bolivian movement. Finally, he stated that Bolivia had once and for all stopped Paraguay's nearly 40 years of continuous secret encroachment on its territory.</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet to be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Heads of Navy and Army to be Potentially Replaced</p>
<p>▲Havas News Agency, Rome, 16th: After the reorganization of the Italian cabinet on July 20, outsiders said that this reorganization was not complete and that those who temporarily retained their posts might still need to be replaced. This news was reported by our agency. Currently, Prime Minister Mussolini is determined to rectify various agencies to give them vitality and to make them implement it with thunderous power. This can be seen in the recent change of ambassadors. As a result, the saying that the cabinet will still be reorganized is becoming more and more credible. The saying that the three departments of the navy, army, and air force will be merged into a Ministry of Defense has been rumored for a long time. Because the King of Italy did not approve of this, it may not be put into practice. The result may only be to replace the heads of the three departments, which is also possible. However, Air Force Minister General Balbo is very popular with the people, and his position is special, so it may not be shaken. It is also heard that the Colonial Minister may also need to be replaced.</p>
<h3>Estonia's Presidential System Proposal Vetoed</h3>
<p>▲National News Agency, Reval, 16th: Estonia's proposal to establish a president was submitted to a national referendum and was vetoed today with 325,000 votes against 310,000. In the future, Estonia will still be the only republic in Europe without a president. Its administrative powers will be shared by the cabinet and parliament.</p>
<h3>Bank of Japan Decides to Reduce Interest Rates</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The Bank of Japan announced at 6:00 PM today that it has decided to reduce interest rates by two percent starting tomorrow, the 18th. The Bank of Japan held a board meeting today. In view of the current financial situation, it decided to reduce the Bank's official discount rate by two percent and announced it at 6:00 PM today. The implementation will begin on the 18th: 1. Discount rate for commercial bills: 1.2% per day. 2.

Interest rate for overdrafts and letter of credit overdrafts: 1.6% per day. The above will be implemented from August 18, Showa 7 [1932].</p>
<h3>Germany's Trade Report for July</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, 16th: Germany's trade report for July was released by the government today. The total value of imports and exports both decreased compared to the same month last year. Imports in July this year amounted to 366,000,000 marks, compared to 562,000,000 marks in the same month last year. Exports amounted to 432,000,000 marks, compared to 827,000,000 marks in the same month last year.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Continued Decline in Japanese Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th: The Japanese exchange rate has continued to decline for several days, falling from 26 US dollars to 24 US dollars. According to observations by those familiar with the news, there are six reasons for the continued decline in exchange rates: (1) It is related to the issue of recognizing "Manchukuo" and the atmosphere of diplomatic unease. (2) It is expected that the future of American cotton will definitely rise, so there is an urgency to import it. (3) It is expected that the exchange rate will fall again, so exports are being waited for. (4) There is speculation in Shanghai to sell Japanese currency and buy silver coins. (5) Due to the improvement of the American financial sector, the US dollar is strong. (6) The situation of the temporary parliament is chaotic. These reasons must continue at present, and it is feared that the decline will not stop until the temporary parliament adjourns.</p>
<h3>Opposition to the Budget by the Seiyukai in Japan</h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – The Seiyukai held a meeting of its Policy Research Council at its headquarters this afternoon and decided on a specific plan for national salvation in the current situation. It was decided to convene an executive meeting on the 18th to exchange opinions on the following two items: (1) whether to force the government to implement the Seiyukai's national salvation plan; and (2) if forced implementation is pursued, what attitude should be adopted if the government shows no sincerity in implementation. Recently, within the party, opinions on the attitude toward the government have been divided into hard-line and soft-line factions. The hard-line arguments of young and ambitious Diet members are particularly dominant, and even the executive branch is tending toward a hard-line stance due to the prevailing trend, which is highly noteworthy.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 17th – With the Diet set to convene within a week, political activity is gradually increasing. A faction of the Seiyukai, together with the National League recently organized by Mr. Adachi, has expressed criticism of the government,責責其所擬救濟辦法尙不充分之表示, saying that the relief measures it has proposed are not sufficient. Although the general view is that no serious incident will occur during the Diet session, it is reported that the police have arrested four members of the Jinmu Party for plotting to assassinate Prime Minister Saito and cabinet members Takahashi and Yamamoto. It is said that this opposition party is angry at the cabinet's incompetence in dealing with the current situation and wants to avenge party members who were arrested in connection with the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi on May 15th.</p>
<h3>Joint Fleet of Japan to be Reviewed Next Month</h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – More than sixty warships of the Joint Fleet, led by the Kongo, arrived at Yokosuka Naval Port this morning at 8:30, one after another. The fleet will set sail for the South Pacific in early September to be reviewed by Field Marshal Prince Fushimi.</p>
<h3>Unemployment in England Continues to Increase</h3>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, London, 16th – The number of unemployed people in England continues to increase. As of July 25th, the total number of unemployed workers reached 1,995,453, an increase of 33,694 compared to the previous month and an increase of 117,910 compared to the same month last year.</p>
<h3>Successful Experiment of Silent, Smokeless Gun</h3>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Rome, 16th – It was announced today that two Italian artillery officers, Mr. Di Lusi and Mr. Guiyala, have invented a silent, smokeless gun. It has been tested by a committee of experts near Naples. The improved 75mm field gun (i.e., 75mm) was fired several times, with absolutely no sound, and even the smoke was almost invisible. The experts, witnessing its extraordinary success, were extremely delighted and shouted "Long live Italy!" This gun can appear and disappear like a ghost, making it impossible for the enemy to know its location. It is truly a weapon of war. It is also reported that the same success has been achieved with larger caliber field guns.</p>
<h3>Austrian Parliament Approves the Treaty of Lausanne</h3>

<h3>Gandhi Disciple Slade Arrested</h3>

<h3>Appeal of the Assassin of Former French President to be Heard Soon</h3>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Paris, 17th – The Supreme Court will review the appeal of Gu Golov, the assassin of President Doumer, on August 20th. Gu's defense lawyer, based on two points, requests the court to overturn the original verdict. The first point is that the assassination of President Doumer has a political nature, and the constitution of 1848 once stipulated the abolition of the death penalty for political assassins. The second point is that the judgment of the court on the defendant is inaccurate. The rapporteur will present sufficient reasons against the above two points, saying that Gu Golov's appeal is just a routine formality, and the court has only one way to reject it.</p>
<h3>German Government Plans to Relieve Unemployment</h3>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Berlin, 16th – After the breakdown of negotiations between the Federal Government and the Hitler Party, there is some time to study non-political issues. The government's first responsibility is to relieve unemployment. There are two ways to do this: either provide funds to various industries and state-owned enterprises to develop their work, or establish voluntary work. For the first method, the government seems to be adopting the method set by the Brüning cabinet, but there are differences of opinion between the government and the central bank regarding the amount of funds required. The central bank had previously received some promissory notes through discounting procedures, but these promissory notes could not be cashed later, and the bank suffered greatly. Therefore, the bank is unwilling to allocate the required amount of 355 million marks for the government's plan in full through discounting procedures. As for voluntary work, the government is very keen to expand it, because the wages of voluntary workers are not much more than unemployment benefits, so it does not cost much to implement.</p>
<h3>Spanish Royalist Rebellion Case</h3>
<p>Another 174 Arrested</p>
<p>▲ Kokumin News Agency, Madrid, 16th – Regarding the Royalist rebellion case, another 174 people were arrested today. The total number of arrests throughout Spain has now exceeded 1,000.

Mr. Balella served as the Minister of the Army of the Sanjuelde reactionary government and fled last Wednesday to an unknown destination.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Madrid, 17th – After the State Council meeting this afternoon, the Prime Minister asked the President to sign a law to confiscate the agricultural property of the monarchist parties involved in the rebellion.</p>
<p>▲ Havas News Agency, Grenada, Spain, 16th Morning – Shops in the city center are on strike, trams are out of service, and the scene is extremely desolate. However, the supply of food in the market is still as usual. Police are stationed in all corners to prevent accidents. Although several conflicts have occurred, no one has been injured. The governor ordered all liquor stores in the city and nearby to close. At 1:00 PM, the authorities posted a notice stating that if shops remain closed before 3:00 PM, they will be fined 500 Spanish coins, etc. Most of the shops resumed part of their business at that time, but the iron sheds were not fully opened. Someone sabotaged the power plant, causing the city to lack electricity. Repair work is expected to be completed in the evening.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Expected Date of Return to Europe by the League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>▲ Compilation of Report Can be Completed as Expected</p>
<p>▲ Expected to Leave Beiping for Europe Around the Beginning of Next Month. Beiping Correspondence: The Investigation Team of the League of Nations is currently compiling its report and organizing the large number of documents it has collected for reference. The report is now being drafted, and the team deeply hopes that the report can be delivered to Geneva on September 15th as scheduled. However, some people in Europe believe that the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on July 1st to extend the six-month deadline for discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute (this deadline is set in accordance with Articles 12 and 15 of the League of Nations Covenant) is related to the progress of the Investigation Team's work. This is what those close to the Investigation Team are deeply surprised about. The feeling in Geneva seems to be that one of the reasons for the extension of the Article 12 deadline is due to the delay in the organization and departure of the Investigation Team, and the other is due to the slow progress of the Investigation Team's work. Some even believe that the Investigation Team requested an extension because it could not complete the report on schedule. However, according to the actual situation, this is not the case. The difficulty regarding the deadline issue is actually caused by the situation. When China initially appealed to the League of Nations, it invoked Article 11 of the Covenant. Only after the Investigation Team departed did China invoke the provisions of Article 15. Article 11 originally had no deadline or six-month limit. The restriction of Article 12 was caused by Article 15. It can be seen that the organization of the Investigation Team and its mission are based on Article 11. If the League of Nations had handled the investigation procedure in accordance with the provisions of Article 15, the group it selected would have been organized differently, its personnel would have been limited to those in the area, its powers would have been more limited, its report would have been narrower in scope, and the deadline would have been shorter. Now it is not the case. The scope of the Investigation Team's mission is very broad. Its task is not only to investigate the truth of a certain specific incident, but also to strive to promote Sino-Japanese relations. The Investigation Team should also study the background of the incident and examine the general situation in the Far East. This is necessary to understand the full picture of the incident.</p>
<p>In addition, the Investigation Team encountered major difficulties in the investigation process that it had to overcome. One of them was that the governments of the countries concerned, whether China or Japan, could not submit certain important documents to the Investigation Team before July or even early this month. Even though the Investigation Team's mission is extremely broad and the investigation work is extremely difficult, its report may still be compiled within the date originally scheduled for departure from Europe without being delayed. When the Investigation Team departed from Geneva, the League of Nations told all members that it did not expect the report to be completed before the end of August or the beginning of September. The budget for the Investigation Team's expenses stipulated in Geneva also stated that the Investigation Team's working period could be extended to nine months if necessary. It is also very reasonable for the League of Nations General Assembly to use the report drafted by the Investigation Team in accordance with Article 11 as a reference when it examines the Sino-Japanese incident in accordance with Article 15. Therefore, the League of Nations decided to extend its review period. How can it be said that it is due to the slow progress of the Investigation Team's work? The Investigation Team's work is proceeding as usual, and it is striving to complete it as soon as possible within the limits of the environment. It has not been delayed at all. In general, the Investigation Team will depart from Beiping in early September and return to Europe via Siberia. (Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Journey to the West (Zhi Zhong)</h3>
<p>▲ We Set Off Quickly</p>
<p>People who have long enjoyed the prosperity of the city resolutely braved the scorching heat and set off at 6:00 PM on August 11th, traveling tens of thousands of miles, crossing mountains and rivers, towards the northwest, which is generally regarded as a desolate and desolate place. No matter how terrible cholera is, they don't care. No matter how rampant bandits are, they don't care. Their only spirit and only aspiration is to conduct on-the-spot investigations in the northwest, develop the northwest, and protect the northwest, so that it will not become a continuation of the northeast. This is the only good news I think since the September 18th Incident. We don't want to lose the northeast. Our goal is to recover the northeast with all our might on the one hand and to defend the northwest with all our might on the other hand. The realization of the Shaanxi Industrial Investigation Team is the first step to complete this goal.</p>
<p>The Shaanxi Industrial Investigation Team was initiated and organized by the Longhai Railway Administration. All parties involved are experts with experience and specialized knowledge. As of the 10th, a total of 55 representatives from all parties have signed up to participate, which are disclosed separately as follows:</p>

<p>As of 4:00 PM on the 11th, the representatives from all walks of life counted on the southern group (those who went to the southern Shaanxi Road for investigation) included Xu Tinghu, An Han, Yang Zhujun, Lu Chong, Wang Haibo, Wu Qi, Zhao Guobin, Zhou Ren, Chen Zhi, Fang Tongzi, Hu Shuhua, Li Guangzhong, He Qingyun, Li Deyi, Guo Weiping, Zhang Quan, Liu He, Zhao Renjun, Sun Yunzhu, Sun Yanzhong, He Ziyuan, Wang Songnian, Huang Xifan, Xiao Xingwu, Yan Wei, Yang Min, etc., a total of thirty people. The northern route included Hu Boyuan, Liu Binglun, Ma Jin, Zhu Qiqing, Huang Bokui, Hu Juewen, Xu Nairen, Sun Zhongyi, Zhu Ruijie, Chen Qingtang, Gu Zhizhong, Yu Qianliu, Feng Jinglan, Li Yongzhen, Yu Zhonggang, Shen Yiqian, etc., about twenty-five people in total. The rest were unable to come due to illness or other reasons. I departed from Shanghai North Station at 9:25 AM on the 8th and traveled west. Originally, Mr. Wang Zhongwei had decided to go to Shaanxi a month ago to investigate the local social conditions. Unexpectedly, he had a fever the day before his departure and could not go west on the same train. The loneliness of the journey was greatly increased.</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM on the 8th, I arrived at the Jiangbian in Xiaguan, Nanjing. While taking the Chengping ferry across the Yangtze River, I unexpectedly met several comrades, including Hu Shuhua and Guo Weiping, who were "going to Shaanxi." When I arrived at Pukou, I took the ferry back to Xiaguan to change trains, repeating this back and forth, which resulted in me not being able to take the special express train that departed from Pukou at 7:00 PM that night. This made me feel very unhappy, but I was still able to cheer up and visit friends in the city and stayed there overnight.</p>
<p>The night passed quickly, and I got up early the next morning. After 8:00 AM, I took a car out of the city, crossed the river to Pukou, and took the special express train heading north at 10:00 AM to Xuzhou. After getting on the train, the weather was very hot, and all the passengers were sweating profusely, which was very uncomfortable. In addition, the train I was taking this time was the Jinpu train. Although it was nominally a special express train, it stopped at all stations, large and small, which greatly extended the time.</p>
<p>At about 9:30 PM, I arrived in Xuzhou. As soon as I got off the train, I was greeted by Stationmaster Xia. During the two hours in Xuzhou, I met Mr. Wang Yizun. He originally took the Pinghan Road to Zhengzhou, but the section of the line at Handan was washed away by the flood, and the train could not pass. He returned to Peiping and then from Peiping to Xuzhou.</p>
<p>We took the train west from Xuzhou at 12:30 AM. When we arrived in Kaifeng at about 11:00 AM the next morning, Mr. Hu Juewen got on the train from Kaifeng and met us. We talked and talked on the train. At 2:00 PM, we arrived at the meeting place in Zhengzhou. We were very grateful for all the hospitality we received in Zhengzhou. All the accommodation and food issues were resolved by the Longhai Railway Administration. On the evening of that day (the 10th), the colleagues of the road had a social gathering. On the morning of the 11th, the special party department of the road and the director Qian Zongze and Ling Hongxun gave a grand reception to all the members of the Shaanxi Industrial Investigation Team.</p>
<p>At 6:15 PM on the afternoon of the 11th, we, a group of more than 50 people, took a special train and set off westward again. According to the schedule, we could arrive at Tongguan at about 10:00 AM on the 12th. After arriving at Tongguan, we planned to take a car to Xi'an and arrive at our destination at about 7:00 PM in the evening.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 11th, it rained heavily, and the streets and alleys were almost flooded. Although the rain slowed down a little in the afternoon, it did not stop. The sky was gloomy, which reduced people's interest a lot, but our courage to work westward was absolutely not affected in the slightest. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Talks About the Issue of Public Security in North China</h3>
<p>▲ Obey All Central Government Orders</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Zhang Xueliang, the Director of the Peiping Pacification Office, decided to resign, the central government has formulated a plan to abolish the Pacification Office and establish a Peiping Branch of the Military Commission for the overall situation in North China. During this period, all parties have paid close attention to Han Fuju's attitude. Zhang Xueliang and Han have had a deep relationship in recent years, and Han has a considerable history of directly and indirectly maintaining public security in North China. According to reliable sources here, Zhang Xueliang sent a telegram here, intending to invite Han to serve as the Chairman of the Peiping Military Commission and seeking his consent. Han told people that the country is in urgent need of difficulties, and the political situation has changed suddenly. The public security in North China should be maintained in a unified manner. It is said that I will go to Peiping and take military responsibility. I am not worthy of such a major responsibility and the complex situation in Peiping. I have done my best to maintain public security in Shandong over the years, and I am still worried about accidents. For the public security in North China, I can only obey the orders of the central government. In addition, Song Shiyan, the director of the Peiping office of the Third Route Army, came to Jinan from Peiping on the 201st train this morning at 9:00 to report to Han on the recent situation in Peiping. Someone asked if Director Zhang had sent a telegram to solicit Chairman Han's opinion and invite him to serve as the Chairman of the Peiping Branch of the Military Commission. Song replied that he had not heard of it. (August 16th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Zhongyuan Company Bombed</h3>
<p>▲ A Bomb Was Found in the Makeup Department, but the Damage Was Minimal</p>
<p>▲ The Manager Said He Thought It Was Done by Patriotic Elements. Tianjin Correspondence: Since the September 18th Incident, the sales of Japanese goods in China have plummeted. However, in North China, the people's movement has been repeatedly suppressed, so that in the past three months, the Japanese goods market has returned to its original state, and profiteers only know how to make profits and do not know how to love the country. They often change the trademarks of Japanese goods to deceive their compatriots, which is especially hateful. Tianjin Zhongyuan Company is the largest department store. Customers are mostly affected by the plainclothes team directed by the Japanese, and the business is very depressed. Therefore, a branch was established on Huazhong Road in the French Concession. Recently, the business has improved slightly, while the main store in the Japanese Concession is still deserted. In the past two months, the fifth-floor theater and the rooftop garden have been restored, and tickets are only sold for two cents. Since July 15th, the main branch has held a one-month price reduction and offered a 3,000 yuan prize, and the business is booming. Unexpectedly, at 5:20 PM yesterday (the 14th), a bomb suddenly exploded in the cosmetics department on the ground floor of the main store, with a loud noise that was deafening. It happened to be Sunday, and there were many visitors. With the loud noise, the order was disrupted, and people fled in droves. The patrolling police officers urgently sounded the police whistle, and the Japanese police station was only a short distance away. Within three minutes of the bombing, the director of the station, Xinban, led the entire police force and ran forward. On the one hand, he cut off traffic on the roads around the company and searched everyone he met. On the other hand, he sealed the company's doors, wanting to conduct a detailed search. At this time, the tourists were still fleeing outward like a tide. Huang Wenqian, the manager of the company, was afraid that sealing the doors and searching would be embarrassing for the tourists, and the bomber had already disappeared. Even if he wanted to search, it would only cause trouble. So he repeatedly negotiated with Xinban and did not seal the doors and search. The disturbance lasted for an hour, and three suspects were arrested before traffic was restored. However, the news spread and shocked the city. In the evening, not only were there no customers in the theater and rooftop garden, but also the night market selling Japanese goods was deserted. The Japanese took the opportunity to make a fuss, thinking that this bomb had a political effect, and sent several Japanese soldiers to the roof of the company in the evening to look out over Chinese territory and sent armed military police to patrol back and forth in the Sino-Japanese border area. It can be said that it was just a waste of time. The cosmetics department of the company that was bombed has been completely repaired today (the 15th). The customers on the first, second, third, and fourth floors are as rare as morning stars. According to manager Huang Wenqian, yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, a customer bought a bottle of Xuehua Cream from Huang Jingxiang in the cosmetics department, which cost three cents and five cents. The customer gave a four-cent Mao ticket and asked the trainee Lin Chengye to take it to the main counter to get change. At this time, the buyer left a paper bag on the glass cabinet and left. Huang Jingxiang did not pay attention at first. When Lin Chengye returned from the main counter to get the change, he did not see the buyer, so he put the Xuehua Cream on the paper bag left behind and waited for him to pick it up. Unexpectedly, he used a little too much force, and the paper bag contained a bomb, which exploded immediately when hit. Lin Chengye was the closest to it, and half of his right side was injured by the explosion. Fortunately, the explosive force was not strong, so it did not affect others. Only a few pieces of glass in the cosmetics department were broken, and the damage was limited. Lin Chengye was immediately sent to the Common Hospital, where the shrapnel was taken out, and he will recover soon. As for the person who placed the bomb, some say he looked like a worker, and some say he was a young man in a suit. Because the shop assistants were very busy at the time, they did not pay close attention and could not judge. Huang also said that since the Tianjin Incident last year, the company was located in the Japanese Concession, so it had to set up a branch in the Concession to help itself. It was originally planned to close the main company, because it was afraid that more than 500 employees would lose their jobs and add a hidden worry to society. Recently, the business has improved slightly, and another incident occurred last night, which is really unfortunate. Outsiders suspect that the company is selling Japanese goods, which is a misunderstanding. If you investigate with the customs, you will understand. The unfortunate incident last night, I think it was done by patriotic elements, but I did not receive any prior warning. According to a gentleman in the business community, patriotic elements have recently organized a traitor-killing group and a Leifeng team, which often warn shops in writing. Hua Zhu Ni Rong Hao has been bombed once, and it is inevitable to be terrified. However, Japanese goods have not completely disappeared. A few days ago, the company published an advertisement in the newspaper to reply to the traitor-killing group, saying that it no longer sells Japanese goods. If you don't believe it, you can come and investigate. Whether Zhongyuan Company has received a warning, outsiders do not know. However, yesterday, it suddenly published a full-page advertisement in major newspapers, introducing domestic products. The intention can be imagined. The bombing of the shop is the third time for Zhongyuan. Therefore, the actions of the managers of the shops have been under strict martial law at all times. (August 15th)</p>
<h3>Wang Lingji's Troops Repulse He Long's Remnant Bandits</h3>
<p>▲ He Bandits' Night Attack on Shashi Thwarted</p>
<p>▲ Loss of Contact with Bandits in Honghu</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: He Long's remnant bandits, previously defeated by the 10th Army in conjunction with Sichuan troops, retreated to Honghu, but still plotted to harass western Hunan. Due to the National Army's blockade, they were unable to succeed. He Chengjun recently returned to Hankou after inspecting Yuekou, stating that he had ordered a large army to encircle Honghu and was determined to annihilate the bandits before the deadline set by Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Unexpectedly, He's bandits suddenly invaded Jingzhou and Shashi via a hidden route, making the situation very urgent. Fortunately, Wang Lingji, the Acting Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Upper Yangtze River area stationed in Shashi, quickly mobilized troops and repulsed them. On the 15th, Wang telegraphed a report to Hankou regarding the situation of repelling He's bandits, stating: "He's bandits, observing that our main forces were all at the front, daringly led the 3rd Regiment of the Pseudo 7th Division and the 2 Regiments of the Pseudo 8th Division themselves on the 13th, traveling secretly at night, departing from Longwan and Zhangjinhe, passing through Caojiachang and Jiangjiaqiao between Haoxue and Zifusi, and directly attacked Shashi. Upon receiving the report, I immediately ordered Regiment Commander Tong Yi and Regiment Commander Yang Huan to confront the enemy, and also ordered Regiment Yang stationed at Cenhekou and Zifusi, and Regiment Su stationed at Hougang and Shi Huibiao, to return to attack from the flanks. At dawn on the 14th, the bandits attacked in two routes, one at the Caoshi outside Jingzhou (i.e., Jiangling) city, which was bravely repelled by Battalion Chen of my Regiment Tong, and the other at Qinglongguan and Jinghua Temple east of Shashi, engaging in fierce battles with my Regiments Tong and Yang all day long. When my Regiment Yang stationed at Cenzi and Regiment Su stationed at Houshi attacked Jing-Sha from the bandit's flanks in the evening, the bandit's momentum was unsustainable, and they collapsed and retreated eastward along the original route in the middle of the night. In this battle, hundreds of bandits were killed and wounded, and their pseudo-division commander Wang Yiming was also wounded, and many were captured. In addition to sending teams to pursue, 'I also ordered the Luo Column to move south to intercept.'" It is now heard that the regiments led by He's bandits have lost contact with the bandits in Honghu. The National Army will separately encircle and annihilate them. The date of annihilation may not be far off. (August 16th)</p>
<h3>Sixth Day of Continued Trial of the Noulens Case</h3>
<p>▲ Noulens Roars in Court and is Ordered to Leave</p>
<p>▲ Prosecutor Reports on the Case's Progress</p>
<p>▲ Debate Concludes and Sentencing Set for the 19th</p>
<p>On the 17th, at 9:00 AM, the Jiangsu High Court continued to hear the case of the Noulens and Wang Delie endangering the Republic of China at the Nanjing Local Court. The judges present were the same as before. Lawyer Chen Ying was in the audience because Noulens had declared the revocation of his engagement yesterday, so he was not at the lawyer's seat when the court opened. After the judge took the stand, Noulens was brought to the court. Chief Judge Li Mian asked: "Yesterday, you stated that you did not want Lawyer Chen to defend you, so this court should appoint another lawyer. Do you want it or not?" Noulens replied: "According to Article 172 of the Criminal Procedure Law, I have already selected a lawyer to defend me on my behalf. The court cannot appoint one." (Asked) "Why did you not want him to defend you yesterday, and why do you want him to defend you today?" (Answered) "This is a right that the defendant should have. However, at this time, I don't want him to defend me. If necessary, I will still want him to defend me." (Asked) "This cannot be done casually. According to Article 56 of the Court Organization Law, the chief judge has the power to direct this. If you want him to defend you, he must perform his duties. If the previous power of attorney has been revoked, it must be re-entrusted. If it has not been revoked, it must be re-signed in the book for proof." So Noulens signed one after another. Lawyer Chen Ying then took the lawyer's seat, stating that on the one hand, he would abide by Chinese law and obey court rules without being used by the Communist Party, and on the other hand, he would perform his duties without violating the opinions of the defendant. At this point, Prosecutor Zhu Jun stood up to state the reasons for the prosecution in preparation for the start of the debate. Noulens disagreed, saying that the examination of the evidence had not been completed, and the defendant had not answered any opinions on the list of evidence, so the debate could not begin. (Asked) "If you have opinions and reasons, you will have the opportunity to state them at any time. The court does not refuse. Now that the evidence has been examined, the debate should of course begin." Noulens' attitude was strong and he kept clamoring, and order was almost disrupted. The judge said, "If you do not obey the order, you will suffer." Noulens' attitude became more stubborn. The court then ruled according to the obstruction of court order and ordered the bailiff to take him out of the court and押押回看守所中. He roared loudly as he left. Although Wang Delie was not as stubborn as Noulens, he also did not obey the court's order to maintain order, and was also ordered by the bailiff to be taken out and押回原所. The prosecutor then began to report, saying that before this case was solved, the Singapore authorities, after discovering the activities of the Communist Party in the East, notified the Shanghai Public Concession Bureau to conduct a secret investigation. After investigation, they found that post office box number 205 was commonly used by the Communist Party, and it was discovered that the user of this number, Er Sheng, was Noulens' alias, living at number 235 Sichuan Road, Shanghai. The Shanghai Police also discovered that Noulens often went to room 30, Block C, number 49 Nanjing Road. On June 15, 20th year [of the Republic], at 8:00 AM, Noulens was captured at number 235 Sichuan Road, and three bunches of keys were found on him, one bunch with thirteen keys, one bunch with eight keys, and one bunch with six keys, as well as one hundred and three yuan in banknotes. At that time, many envelopes and newspapers were also checked. Later, at room 30, Block C, number 49 Nanjing Road, many envelopes and newspapers were found, which were the same as those found at number 235 Sichuan Road. Later, one of the keys from the bunch of thirteen was used to open a small room. In addition to many stationery and clothing, three safes were found outside the room. The locksmith was hired to try these three bunches of keys one by one. As a result, two boxes were opened. In the second box, another key was found, which opened the third box. There were many Communist Party documents inside, totaling more than 600 pieces, of which 76 pieces were extremely related to endangering the Republic of China. This document can be divided into three categories: the first category is documents about the Chinese Communist Party's reports to the Communist Party leaders; the second category is documents of instructions and decrees from the Third International; the third category is documents that incite workers and peasants to direct the Red Army in Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and other provinces to betray [the government].

<h3>Sichuan Army's Tian Songyao Purchases Aircraft in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>▲ Sixteen Aircraft in Total, Unable to be Transported to Sichuan</p>
<p>▲ Ma Qiyun's Detention in Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Tian Songyao, commander of the 29th Army of the Sichuan Army, recently sent Ma Qiyun to Hong Kong to order a batch of aircraft for the use of the army to organize an aviation team. Ma, whose family is from Taishan, Guangdong, studied aviation in the United States. After returning to China, he was ordered by Tian to purchase aircraft. After ordering sixteen combat aircraft with a flying speed of 210 meters per hour from the Hong Kong Lam Eun-jung Company, six were bombers, six were fighters, and four were trainers. However, after these aircraft were purchased, the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou authorities suddenly formed a new alliance, and Liu Xiang of Sichuan no longer seemed to be united with the southwest. The original plan was to transport Tian's aircraft to Sichuan via the Yangtze River through Chongqing, but Chongqing was Liu Xiang's territory, and Tian's aircraft might be detained if they passed through. Ma Qiyun then planned to open a new air route from Guangdong and Guangxi through Guizhou and directly to eastern Sichuan. If this route was open, the Tian army's aircraft in Hong Kong could all take off from Hong Kong without passing through Chongqing. Therefore, a Canadian pilot, 吉地氏, was hired in Hong Kong as an assistant. On the 8th, he flew a steel trainer aircraft and took off in Hong Kong. The itinerary was to take the route through Wuzhou and Liuzhou in Guangxi, cross Guiyang, and reach the eastern Sichuan Tian army defense area. The Guangxi Provincial authorities had been notified in advance to take care of the aircraft along the way. After Ma and others took off, they suddenly encountered headwinds, and resistance occurred during the flight. When they arrived at Wuzhou, they saw that the Wuzhou airfield was flooded, and they were forced to return to Guangzhou and landed at the Shougouling airfield. At that time, the Guangdong aviation personnel thought that Ma had come to Guangdong by plane without prior notice and suspected that there was something else going on. They flew to report to Chen Jitang. Chen was also suspicious and ordered the aircraft and the pilot to be detained. Then, an adjutant was sent from the headquarters to greet Ma Qiyun to the Commander-in-Chief's Office, where he was transferred to the Military Police Headquarters for detention. Ma's assistant, 吉地氏, thought that Ma was a formal commissioner of the Sichuan Army and was suddenly detained, so he visited Li Zongren to ask for rescue. Li knew that Ma was sent by Tian Songyao, so he interceded with Chen Jitang for Ma. At the same time, Bai Chongxi of Guangxi heard the news and also sent a telegram requesting bail. Chen Jitang then knew the inside story. The next day (9th) at 3:00 PM, he summoned Ma and explained the reason for the misunderstanding, saying that this incident was due to a telegram from Liu Xiang in advance, and showed Liu's telegram, which stated that Ma was a communist. After Ma was released, he flew the original aircraft back to Hong Kong on the 11th. According to Ma, although he encountered setbacks this time, he was still determined to test the new air route between Guangxi, Guizhou, and Sichuan. After ten or eight days, he would plan to fly back to Sichuan again in order to safely transport the purchased aircraft back to eastern Sichuan. (August 12th)</p>
<h3>Shantou Business Community Opposes Business Tax</h3>
<p>▲ Organizing a Committee Against Business Tax</p>
<p>▲ Resolving to Prepare for a General Strike</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Since the Financial Department appointed Hu Guannan as the Director of the Shantou Business Tax Bureau, the business community has risen up in opposition, and a meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce to decide to telegraph the province to request a postponement of the tax, citing the people's hardship. However, after this telegram was sent, more than ten days passed without any response. Hu Guannan further decided to open the business as ordered, and those who failed to comply within the time limit would be punished in accordance with the regulations. The merchants were panic-stricken. Yesterday (7th) at 2:00 PM, another meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce. Many representatives attended the meeting, and reporters were politely refused to attend, so it was not easy to know the content of the resolutions. However, it was heard that the strike movement had been decided, and the Remittance Association, the Silver Industry Association, the Medicinal Materials Association, the Jiangsu-Guangdong Association, the Silk Cloth Association, the North-South Port Goods Transportation Association, the Match Association, the Brokerage Association, the Tourism Association, the Liquor Association, the Restaurant Association, the 洋糖 Association, the Miscellaneous Grain Association, and other thirteen groups were designated as the Committee Against Business Tax. It was also voted to temporarily suspend the payment of business tax until the government abolished various harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies. The city's fifty-one businesses, together with those who did not fill out the report and obtain a license, if the Business Tax Bureau imposed a fine, they would paste the "Permanently Closed" sign on the door and automatically strike. It was heard that the Business Tax Bureau saw that the attitude of the merchants was激昻, and few people went to fill out the report and obtain a license. On the 8th, the Business Tax Bureau changed its attitude and announced an extension of ten days, from the 9th to the 18th. If the merchants still did not fill out the report and obtain a license, they would be punished. Judging from the situation, the business community did not seem willing to submit. (August 9th)</p>

<p>▲ Demanding Soil Relief Leads to a Murder Case. Zheng Wanglong, who lived upstairs in a wonton shop at No. 3 Sanbanqiao, Dongshanchang Alley, and made a living by selling soil, was owed one yuan and one corner of soil money by Wang Xinyuan, nicknamed Xiaowang, who worked as a shop assistant in an opium den. He had been demanding it for a long time without success. A few days ago, Zheng gathered Xiaogen Sheng to beat Wang severely, causing injuries. Wang Xinyuan died of his injuries on the 16th. Zheng Wanglong was anxious and tried to escape, but was pursued and caught by the police from the jurisdiction, along with his mother, Liu. Later, it was learned that Zheng had a large amount of opium hidden at No. 25 Dongshanchang Alley. The police were immediately dispatched to search, and more than 50 taels of opium paste and red pills were found. After reporting to the District Court to send personnel to check, Zheng Wanglong and others were sent to the court for interrogation, and the fugitive Xiaogen Sheng was wanted for arrest and brought to justice.</p>

Four师船 were immediately dispatched to Wangdun Port, where they encountered two bandit ships. The bandits took the lead in firing guns and refused to knock. The water police also fired guns in retaliation. After a stalemate of about half an hour, the bandits went ashore and fled. A prisoner of the name Yu Piao Zhu Afeng was rescued, and two bandit ships and one gun were seized. They have been解蘇卅區部 and sent for disposal yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>▲ Prolonged Drought Affects Autumn Silkworms. The failure of silkworm farming in the spring and summer seasons in the city has led to the collapse of farmers' economy. The hardship cannot be described in words. In the hearts of farmers, a bumper harvest of autumn silkworms and autumn crops was expected to make up for the losses. Unexpectedly, the heavens did not help people. The drought ravaged the land, and many of the rice paddies were dried up. The autumn silkworms in the countryside, the early batch had already眠三眠, and the late batch were opening their leaves for the second眠. Due to the drought, the mulberry leaves were dry and lacked nutrition. The silkworms were greatly affected after eating them. Therefore, the future of autumn silkworms cannot be viewed with optimism.</p>

If the recognized amount is determined, the re-appointment will be made at the Shanghai Taxation Department in the afternoon of the same day. Yesterday, the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau telegraphed the Xishang Association to inform all merchants.</p>
<p>▲ Requesting to Retain Local Construction Funds in the County. The local surtax levied in this county has always been used to supplement local autonomy administrative expenses. This year, the Jiangsu Construction Department ordered the county to transfer all the construction funds collected and stored to the province for application, resulting in extremely tight local funding. Recently, the Construction Department planned to use half of the local construction funds as provincial funds and ordered the Finance Bureau to report and解省庫 on a monthly basis. The Wuxi County Funds Property Office, the Township District Funds Property Management Committee, the City Management Committee, and the Chamber of Commerce were deeply concerned that if this bad example was set, the county funds would lose their guarantee in the future. Yesterday, they specially telegraphed the provincial government and the two departments of finance and construction, requesting to withdraw the order and telegraphed the county funds property offices to strive for it together.</p>
<p>▲ The Youth Escorting Criminals Released and Returning to the Provincial Asylum. The Asylum for Youth Returning to the Province established by the Jiangsu High Court outside Panmen, Suzhou, has spacious houses and perfect equipment, with various handicrafts and considerable education. It also issued a notice to all counties that all criminal offenders under the age of 25 should be解送 to the Asylum, where they would be given skills and sincere guidance in order to repent and enter the right track so that they can make a living after leaving the asylum and not go astray. Upon receiving the order, County Chief Chen extracted 25 people, including Zhang Agen, Wang Haogen, Bian Jinlong, Ji Er, Zhu Along, Shen Lianxi, Sun Houde, Zhou Fenggen, Lu Fuhai, Xu Shenghe, Wang Xingbao, Qian Haibao, Liu Laosi, Chang Chengfu, and Wu Guangshou, and sent Wu Zhengrong, the chief of political police, to escort them to Suzhou.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>▲ Xu Xiangyun Escapes Danger After Being Kidnapped. Xu Xiangyun, the son of Xu Lansheng of Xujiagang, two miles north of Dongwaicangmin, was kidnapped by bandits on the night of the 10th and demanded 5,000 yuan. The county government believed that the banditry in Dongxiang was rampant again and sent a police team to encircle and suppress bandits in Anquan Village, capturing a bandit accomplice named Lu Yanbiao and解縣 for interrogation. The night before, the bandits suddenly released Xu Xiangyun and even demanded that a certain party leniently handle Lu Tingbiao.</p>
<p>▲ Disputes Between Ministry and Province over Tobacco and Alcohol Tax. The Jiangyin tobacco and alcohol business license tax was approved by the province for Yi Hui to take over. In the 21st year, the provincial bureau still ordered him to continue to operate it. However, due to the dispute between the ministry and the province for more than a month, there was still no specific solution. The office has not been able to open for levy, and the Ministry of Finance sent Gao Xilai to Cheng yesterday (16th) to organize a branch bureau at Puhui Bridge and start work. The two bureaus and branch bureaus also urged Yi Hui, the稽征 office, to解 the 款項 for July and report them on time, resulting in a double-包案. The tobacco and alcohol merchants in the county stopped解 and awaited the solution because they did not know what to do.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>▲ The Youth Corps Warns Executive Yang of the County Party Department. Yang Jiechen, an executive member of the County Party Department, received a warning letter from the Iron-Blooded Youth Corps via mail at noon on the 16th, containing a bullet, which roughly stated that Yang was obstructing the anti-Japanese work (Yang expressed disagreement with the anti-Japanese association's proposal to employ ten voluntary cadres), and the first small gift was offered, etc. It was also heard that Yang had crossed the river to the provincial party department to make a statement after receiving the letter.</p>
<p>▲ The Yutong Election Case Opens. After the Yutong Salt Company's re-election, disputes arose repeatedly. Now, Lianji shareholder Fang Shaoqing filed a complaint against Chen Xiangchen, the director of the company, alleging that the election was illegal and that the resolution was invalid. The case was opened at 8:00 AM on the 15th. The plaintiff's lawyer Yan Qi and the defendant's lawyer Zhu Naigeng appeared in court for arguments. As a result, it was ruled that Yutong was not registered and could not be handled according to the Company Law. The plaintiff was ordered to correct the complaint according to the partnership business. The court also 調取 the shareholder meeting sign-in books for the past three years and the election tickets of this session for review. It was scheduled to interrogate the related parties Xu Sude, Ding Chunzhi, Wan Bichen, Zhang Luxuan, and others.</p>
<p>▲ Measures for Punishing Traitorous Merchants at Anti-Japanese Conference. The Anti-Japanese Association of Jiangdu County held an emergency meeting yesterday (15th) due to the discovery of a large number of Japanese yarn from Beipailou Fangyuanxing, totaling 50 pieces. The meeting was chaired by Chang Yinquan, and three measures were decided: (1) The association will seal up the store together with the Chamber of Commerce and send a letter to the Public Security Bureau for assistance; (2) The owner of the store will be punished with 站木 for three days; (3) It was scheduled to burn the discovered enemy goods and send letters to various agencies for surveillance. It was also decided to announce to the people of the county that if anyone secretly reports the private entry of enemy goods, they will be given corresponding rewards. However, it was heard that the number of Japanese yarn stopped by Fang was not limited to this number. In addition to entrusting more than 40 or 50 packages each to Zhang Shenghe and Huacheng and other towel factories on Ximen Street, there were also Japanese yarn of less than two pieces stored in a certain surname's house in the Ancient Guanyin Temple. I don't know if the Anti-Japanese Association can find a way to investigate it.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>▲ The Bao堰 Town Assassination Case is Adjudicated. Huang Ma, a villager of Bao Yan Heou in the county, together with her son Huang Rongdao and fellow villager Zhang Guisheng, killed her lover Li Hongbin on September 24 last year and abandoned his body in the mountains. It was discovered on the 30th of the same month and reported to the local security group. It was confirmed that it was Li's body. The woman could not recognize it because her face was blurred and refused to admit it. After someone proved that it was true, the woman and her son were arrested. It was later learned that Zhang Guisheng, Sun Guangfa, Wang Qishun, and others were suspected of conspiring to commit murder. They were subsequently arrested and 解 to the court for investigation. After repeated investigations by dispatched personnel, the people were found to have committed a major suspicion of crime and were transferred to the criminal court for trial according to the crime of premeditated murder. Judge Zhou opened the court for a mass trial several times, and the case was already clear, but the witness surnamed Xu had not been arrested, which delayed the conclusion for several months. The debate was finally concluded a few days ago, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced yesterday. Huang Ma and Zhang Guisheng were sentenced to death for jointly plotting murder. Huang Rongdao was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment for jointly plotting murder. Wang Qishun and Sun Guangfa were found not guilty.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>▲ Police and Security Forces Seize Bandits' Weapons. Police and security forces in Yiyu District seized an important bandit, Liu Jucai, in Xinzhen Town.

They went to search and arrest Jiang, and they found seven submachine guns and eighteen rifles in the tomb. They were all解送 to the county government.</p>
<p>▲ The County Government Asks for the Levy of Security Expenses. The County Administrative Conference passed the levy of security expenses based on the standard of 70% from farmers and 30% from merchants, which was levied by the busy漕. The county government presented it to the province for approval on the 16th. However, because the actual silver received in recent years was only about 70%, the amount of this expense should be levied at 240,000 yuan, and the actual amount received should be 168,000 yuan based on 70%.</p>
<p>▲ Thorough Investigation of the Embezzlement and Opium Trafficking Case. The Cheng Guangbin opium trafficking case, which shocked the entire county, involved Yan Ziqing, the accountant of the Public Security Bureau. The county government believed that Yan had embezzled rent donations as operating capital, which was a major case and specially assigned someone to thoroughly investigate it. Cheng had been解 to the court, and Chief Prosecutor Liu had interrogated him once. He also believed that the case was serious and assigned someone to secretly investigate it.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>▲ More Than 300 Zhang of the West Dike of Yutang Collapse. The section of the West Dike of Yutang in Luzhen suddenly collapsed by more than 300 Zhang a few days ago. The section chief was trying to repair it yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ The Chairman of the Linze Chamber of Commerce is Accused. Meng Changchun and other 11 businessmen in Linze Town, District 10 of the county, said that Hu Rulin, the chairman of the town's Chamber of Commerce, had divided the entertainment expenses when Sun Jun retreated in the 16th year among the business community. This 款 was already brought徵 by the county government under the acre donation item. Hu Rulin had collected 400 yuan from the 款產處 in the winter of the 19th year, but it had not been returned to the merchants. Therefore, yesterday, they jointly submitted a request to the county party department, requesting that the county government拘案 and handle it, and at the same time ordered that the 款 be handed over and returned to the merchants.</p>
<h3>Deqing</h3>
<p>▲ Soup Kitchen is Crowded with Famine Victims. Since the甲子, the county has suffered from floods, droughts, wind, and locust plagues, and the silkworm information has been poor for years, resulting in the frequent bankruptcy of the rural economy. Mourning can be heard everywhere, and starvation is everywhere. In the past month, thousands of famine victims have entered the city every day, begging along the way. Their faces are thin and their appearances are miserable. Gao Xingrun, the director of the Public Security Bureau, divided the wheat cakes, and Jin Jinchen, Zhang Youcai, and others ran to Shanghai and Hangzhou to beg for the collection of 款項 to set up soup kitchens in the urban area. Since it opened on the 16th of last month, the number of famine victims has reached more than 219,000, and more than 4,400 silver dollars have been used. As a result, the internal funding is very difficult, and the number of famine victims is increasing day by day.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>▲ Three Sons of the Zhao Family are Kidnapped. Zhao Yinsheng, the richest man in Ma'an, Shaoxing, has three sons, the eldest named Yaoguan, 12 years old, the second son Xianguan, 10 years old, and the youngest son Sanguan, 8 years old. On the evening of the 15th, more than a dozen kidnappers suddenly came, each armed with a handgun, and went straight into the Zhao's house. They did not search for property, but kidnapped all three children and called out the crowd to get on the boat, and drove away quickly from the Dangshan side, leaving a letter demanding a huge 款. Although the official authorities dispatched teams to Keqiao, Qianqing, Xiaoshan, Xiaosidu, and other places to pursue, they have not been found yet. When the bandits came, they first cut off the power lines near Ma'an, causing many telephones in the area and business houses to be out of order.</p>

<p>Second General Assembly</p>
<h3>Adoption of Six Sports Objectives; Organization of a Compilation Committee</h3>
<p>▲Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Nanjing, 17th Telegram - The National Sports Conference was held on the 17th starting at 8 o'clock, and the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Of the 102 members actually present, specially appointed member Niu Yongjian also arrived (Wang Zhengyan and Wu Siyu were still absent, and the Minister and Vice Minister of Education were not present).

<p>▲Chairman Zhang Zhijiang's Report</p>
<p>China's Greatest Malady Lies in Weakness</p>
<p>Three Points to Note During Discussions on Proposals</p>
<p>Zhang said in his report: Speakers say that China's greatest problems are weakness and poverty. Weakness leads to poverty; the former is the cause, the latter is the effect. Weakness is the cause, poverty is the result. China's economic status is unequal, dependent on others, controlled by others, and at the mercy of others. The reason for our own numbness, paralysis, hemiplegia, being bedridden and on our last breath, the biggest reason is weakness. The great malady is weakness, and the key is weakness. If we do not catch up and treat this great illness, and only use other methods to seek economic development and equality of economic status, it will be like climbing a tree to catch fish or waiting for a rabbit to run into a tree. The more we seek, the further away we get. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to strive for strength, restore health, and promote national sports for everyone. If we can do this, equality of status can be expected soon. Therefore, we very much hope that financial experts and medical experts will participate in our conference. I have summarized the opinions expressed by the representatives at yesterday's opening ceremony into three points for your reference when discussing proposals:</p>
<p>(1) Suitable for Chinese national character (2) Use the most economical and convenient methods to promote (3) Strive for universalization of sports, that is, popularization. Please pay attention to the above three points.</p>

<p>Expert Talk</p>
<h3>Ma Liang Talks About Chinese New Martial Arts</h3>
<p>The sports of each country have their own characteristics, and their methods are also different. China has never had a fixed method. Based on my decades of experience, I have created Chinese New Martial Arts, which is a Chinese-style sports movement. Chinese New Martial Arts is divided into four items: unarmed, divided into boxing and wrestling; weapons, divided into sticks and swords. Elementary school students must learn boxing. Middle school students and people over 40 or 50 years old learn wrestling. Wrestling is enough to strengthen the body. Theory and experience are equally important. Whether you can do it or not is shown in the fight. As for sticks, I argue that everyone, regardless of gender or age, must have a stick for self-defense. Swordsmanship is most suitable for the intellectual class. Swordsmen have the style of a gentleman.</p>
<h3>Draft National Physical Education Implementation Plan (3)</h3>
<p>B. Secondary Schools</p>
<p>(1) Grounds—</p>
<p>In addition to removing the areas marked with an "X" in the primary school grounds, the following grounds should be added:</p>
<p>Tennis Courts: Four, approximately 34,000 square feet in total.</p>
<p>Soccer Field: One, approximately 50,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Track and Field Ground: One, approximately 80,000 square feet. The soccer field can be included within the track and field ground, but the running track should not be less than 300 meters; otherwise, it cannot include a soccer field. The above-mentioned grounds are the minimum requirements for secondary schools with fewer than 100 students. For secondary schools with more than 100 students, the area should be doubled for every 100 students, and half of the area can be added at the discretion for those with less than 50 students (but the soccer field and track and field ground should be doubled for every 300 students).</p>
<p>If the school site is close to a public sports ground, the track and field ground in the public sports ground can be fully utilized to reduce the addition of track and field grounds in the school. However, the establishment of a track and field ground in the school should not be completely omitted because of public facilities.</p>
<p>(2) Fixed Equipment—</p>
<p>In addition to removing the items marked with an "X" in the primary school fixed equipment, the following fixed equipment should be added:</p>
<p>Vaulting Box: One X</p>
<p>Jump Over Apparatus (Small Wooden Horse): Two</p>
<p>Wooden Horse: Two</p>
<p>Mats (made of canvas and cotton): Four X</p>
<p>Balance Beam: One X</p>
<p>Pick-Up Race Box: Four</p>
<p>Vaulting Platform: One</p>
<p>Parallel Bars: One</p>
<p>Horizontal Bar (height can be adjusted at will): Two X</p>
<p>Rope Circle: One set</p>
<p>Fixed Equipment for Track and Field:</p>
<p>Shot Put Circle: Two</p>
<p>Shot Puts: Two</p>
<p>Discus Throwing Circle: One</p>
<p>Hurdles: Sixty</p>
<p>Pole Vaulting Stands: One pair</p>
<p>Landing Pit (including pole vaulting, high jump, and long jump): Three</p>
<p>Soccer Goals: One pair</p>
<p>Starting Gun: One</p>
<p>The above-mentioned fixed equipment is the minimum requirement for secondary schools with fewer than 100 students. For secondary schools with more than 100 students, the number should be doubled for every 100 students, and half of the number can be added at the discretion for those with less than 50 students. However, the soccer goals, hurdles, and pole vaulting stands should be doubled for every 300 students.</p>
<p>(3) Consumable Equipment—</p>
<p>In addition to the consumable equipment for primary schools listed above, the following consumable equipment should be added:</p>
<p>Soccer Balls: Four</p>
<p>Discus: Two</p>
<p>Javelins: Twelve</p>
<p>Pole Vaulting Poles: Four</p>
<p>Crossbars: Twenty</p>
<p>Stopwatches: Four</p>
<p>Starting Guns and Ammunition: One hundred and fifty</p>
<p>Tennis Balls: Two dozen</p>
<p>The above-mentioned consumable equipment is the minimum standard per semester for secondary schools with fewer than 100 students. For secondary schools with more than 100 students, the number should be doubled for every 100 students, and half of the number can be added at the discretion for those with less than 50 students. However, the stopwatches, starting guns, and ammunition should be doubled for every 300 students.</p>
<h3>C. Universities and Colleges</h3>
<p>(Grounds)—</p>
<p>Same as secondary schools, but the number of tennis courts should be increased appropriately within the possible range.</p>
<p>(2) Fixed Equipment—</p>
<p>Same as secondary schools, but the items marked with an "X" in the secondary school fixed equipment can be reduced appropriately.</p>
<p>(3) Consumable Equipment—</p>
<p>Same as secondary schools.</p>
<h3>D. Public Sports Grounds</h3>
<p>(1) Grounds—</p>
<p>The number of grounds should be the sum of those required for universities, colleges, primary schools, and secondary schools, and a portion should be designated for women's sports. This is the minimum requirement. If the local population is large and there are many participants in sports, the grounds should be increased appropriately according to the local financial resources. In particular, children's playgrounds should be established in separate areas outside the main grounds. The problem with public sports grounds in the country today is not the insufficient number of grounds but the lack of concrete facilities.</p>
<p>(2) Fixed Equipment—</p>
<p>The number of fixed equipment should be the sum of that required for universities, colleges, primary schools, and secondary schools. Swimming pools are currently lacking in the country and should be gradually established.</p>
<p>(3) Consumable Equipment—</p>
<p>The number of consumable equipment should be the sum of that required for universities, colleges, primary schools, and secondary schools.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned equipment are all outdoor facilities. Physical activities should be held outdoors as much as possible. However, China has a vast territory, and the climate, wind, sand, and rainfall vary from place to place. Indoor physical education facilities are also necessary for most areas. Regardless of whether it is a university, college, primary school, secondary school, or public sports ground, the area of the indoor sports ground must be at least large enough to accommodate one basketball court or one volleyball court. The size should be determined based on the economic situation. As for the construction method, in addition to the amount of funding, it must also be determined based on the climate. The education departments of each province should conduct research on their respective regions and make detailed regulations.</p>
<h3>(3) Funding</h3>
<p>There is no doubt that national physical education should be vigorously promoted in China after years of weakness. However, in recent years, the promotion of physical education by the Chinese people has lacked an overall plan, resulting in two phenomena. First, the central government and wealthy cities spend huge sums of money to build large-scale sports grounds and organize various athletes' sports meets to showcase their achievements in promoting sports. Second, inland areas are affected by natural disasters and man-made disasters, and funding is insufficient. The state of sports facilities is rudimentary, almost non-existent. Both of these extremes are not the true way to promote sports. Wealthy areas should not be surprised by false names, and impoverished areas should know the need for physical education. Each should consider the local situation and take promoting universal sports suitable for the national conditions as the standard, and prepare a corresponding budget to avoid the drawbacks of one side squandering public funds and the other side making empty promises. Considering the conditions in various places, the minimum amounts for the funding of schools and public sports grounds at all levels are roughly as follows. The central and local administrative budgets must be prepared properly by the competent authorities according to the circumstances. I will not elaborate on this here.</p>
<p>The funding for purchasing and repairing grounds and fixed equipment for schools and public sports grounds at all levels should be based on the value of the various equipment purchased locally. Although the purchase value of various fixed and consumable equipment is not exactly the same in various places, the actual difference is very small. The following principles are established and can be reduced proportionally. Those with fewer than fifty people will still be counted as fifty people.</p>
<p>Public sports grounds: 400 yuan per year for practitioners. If this number is exceeded, it should be increased proportionally.</p>
<h3>(4) Methods of Promoting Physical Education</h3>
<p>(1) Research Work: The materials, methods, and standards adopted for the implementation of physical education should be reliable and appropriate only after research procedures. Therefore, research is the first step in promoting physical education. Neglecting it is like a blind man riding a blind horse, and I am afraid that he will go astray. The research institutions can have the following types:</p>
<p>(1) Designate the physical education department of a national university as a research institution. Its funding can be subsidized by the Cultural Foundation or the Ministry of Education to add research professors.</p>
<p>(2) The Cultural Foundation establishes a physical education lectureship to assist the physical education department of a certain university in research work.</p>
<p>(3) Designate domestic educational research and experimental institutions to add a physical education research department, and its funding shall be subsidized by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>(4) Select model cities and towns and villages as physical education experimental zones.</p>
<p>(5) National Martial Arts Museum</p>
<p>B. Research Matters</p>
<p>(1) Physical Education Curriculum for Male and Female Schools at All Levels: The former Ministry of Education had set physical education curriculum standards for senior and junior high schools and primary schools, but there were no detailed particulars. After compiling and designating schools to implement experiments and obtaining satisfactory results, it will be announced and adopted. In the future, experts should be invited to revise the details and engage in trials.</p>
<p>(2) Physical Education Examination Standards: To seek the popularity of physical education, there must be an examination method to examine the performance of students in schools and public sports in the country. However, due to the large number of schools and people, the method must be simple. For each person's performance in each item, only reaching a certain standard is required. This standard must come from measurement and statistics, and it cannot be arbitrarily determined. This standard takes a long time to succeed.</p>
<p>Members visit the Central Sports Ground (photographed in Nanjing Guanghua)</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>(3) National Martial Arts: The value, the similarities and differences of schools, the methods of teaching and competition, and the position in physical education must be jointly studied by national martial artists and sports educators to form an overall plan.</p>
<p>(4) Rural Sports: 85% of the national population lives in the countryside and are mostly farmers. Whether they have spare time to engage in physical education and what kind of activities suit their tastes should be investigated and researched on the spot.</p>
<p>(5) Urban Public Sports: Collect existing folk sports activities, improve them, and promote them. Adopt foreign public sports activities, adapt them to the Chinese environment, and utilize them flexibly.</p>
<p>(Other)</p>
<p>(2) Training of Talents: The ideal institution for training talents is the physical education research institution, such as the Institute of Biology in the capital. Many biologists in China are trained by the institute. However, research institutions cannot be established in large numbers, and all talents cannot be trained by research institutions. Therefore, separate standards for curriculum and training institutions must be established.</p>
<p>A. Curriculum for Physical Education Teacher Training: Chinese society is affected by politics, and the economy is increasingly depleted. University students study at school for many years, and their families bear a heavy burden. It is difficult for the physical education departments of universities in China to recruit enough students, and many drop out due to economic constraints. Therefore, the physical education curriculum must be flexible, dividing the four-year curriculum into two sections. In the first two years, attention is paid to compulsory courses, and in the last two years, attention is paid to elective courses so that students from poor families can leave school halfway to take up teaching positions and then return to school to continue their studies. Then, their experience is rich, their learning ability is increased, and the knowledge they acquire is more practical. The distribution of the curriculum is as follows:</p>

<h3>Record of the 17th Annual Meeting of the China Science Society</h3>
<p>▲ To restore the inherent culture of the Northwest</p>
<p>▲ Held in Chang'an, a remote place in the western frontier</p>
<p>The current annual meeting of the China Science Society was held in Chang'an, Shaanxi. It was prepared in advance by Chang'an members Li Yizhi, Shou Tianzhang, and Li Yan. Members from Beijing, Shanghai, Pingjin and other places arrived in Chang'an one after another, including Wang Qi, Chen Yanshan, Shen Lianghua, Lu Minxing, Ge Suicheng, Zhou Zijing, Xu Nanfei, Sun Yanzhong, Yu Qianliu, Sun Yun, Zhu Qiqing, Li Yongzhen, Hu Shuhua, Hu Boyuan, Feng Jinglan, and Chang'an members Li Yizhi, Shou Tianzhang, Li Yan, Yang Heqing, and more than 20 other people. The opening ceremony was held at the Xunzhen Building of the Civil Affairs Department on the afternoon of August 13. First, Li Yizhi, the president of the annual meeting, delivered the opening speech, which roughly stated that the society had been established for 20 years. The previous 16 annual meetings were mostly held in coastal ports. Now, in order to popularize scientific knowledge, the society held the meeting in Chang'an, a remote place in the Northwest, and also sought to restore and expand the inherent culture of the Northwest. He also hoped that in the future, the military conference would gradually be held in the inland. Then Yang Hucheng, the honorary president of the annual meeting, delivered a speech on behalf of the chairman, briefly stating that Chang'an was located in a remote place in the western frontier and had few opportunities to come into contact with science. The comrades of the China Science Society were very admired for coming to Shaanxi from afar, regardless of the heat and fear of the tiger epidemic. Then the president, Wang Qi, reported on the general situation of the society, briefly stating that the society's purpose was to investigate things and extend knowledge, utilize resources to benefit the people, engage in research on the one hand, and apply the results of the research to society on the other. Due to limited financial resources, the society's work over the years has not been fully developed, but the Mingfu Library and the Institute of Biology in Beijing have been built, and 16 volumes of scientific journals and various scientific series have been published, which also made considerable contributions. There are more than 1,000 members, divided into four groups: materials, biology, engineering, and society. Although the number of people is limited, they are working hard and have great hopes. He also hoped that all walks of life would support them so that scientific knowledge could be popularized among the people, and then Chinese science would have achievements. Next, Zhao Youqin, director of the Shaanxi Construction Department, delivered a speech, first expressing his welcome, and second stating that the people in the Northwest are eating with golden bowls, hoping that the members of the Science Society will use scientific methods to solve this difficulty. Next, Ling Hongxun, director of the Longhai Road West Section Engineering Bureau, members Hu Shuhua, Yang Heqing, Zhou Zijing, and others gave speeches in succession, with many earnest words. Then, the China Book Company presented the society friends with three books: "Education of the Republic of China," "General Situation of Secondary Education in the Country," and "General Situation of Social Education in the Country." At 4:30 p.m., the photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. In the evening, Chairman Yang Hucheng hosted a banquet at the Xincheng Building. In addition to Chairman Yang's personal reception, Director Zhao delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the chairman, and President Wang Wan delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the society. At 8:00 p.m., the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed. The society's meeting in Chang'an was quite welcomed by the general public. The editorials of various newspapers all expressed their welcome, and the Xi'an Daily News specially published a special science issue to show its promotion and express its welcome. On the morning of the 14th, the members of the society still held a society affairs meeting in the Xunzhen Building. At 2:00 p.m., member Zhu Qiqing publicly experimented and lectured at the Mass Education Center. The title was "Radio and Thought."</p>
<h3>The Summer Training Class of the Municipal Education Bureau Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to improve the intelligence of primary school teachers, the Municipal Education Bureau specially held a summer training class, which opened yesterday (17th) at the Minglun Hall in the Municipal Education Center on Wenmiao Road. Those who attended included Xu Peihuang, director of the Education Bureau, Hu Shuyi, representative of the Third Section, and about 200 people including section chiefs, supervisors, inspectors, lecturers, and students. The ceremony was performed as usual. First, the chairman of the Third Section reported on the purpose of the meeting, and then the section chiefs, supervisors, and lecturers gave speeches, all encouraging the students with many words. The venue of the conference is located in the newly built Wenmiao Park, with fresh air and a cool breeze. It is truly a good place for studying in the summer. Therefore, those who listen to the lectures and take the exams do not feel the pain of the heat. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Wang and Song Flew to Beijing on the Same Plane Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Wang said he would never resume his position as President of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<p>The successor will be decided after a trip to Lu for consultation.</p>
<p>Central News Agency said that the problem of Zhang Xueliang's resignation has been resolved, so Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Minister of Finance Song Ziwen and Ms. Chen Bijun, took the Sikes plane back to Beijing at 6:25 a.m. yesterday. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>The Situation When Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, accompanied by Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, took the Sikes plane back to Beijing yesterday morning. Mao Bangchu, principal of Hangzhou Aviation School, Shen Dexie, director of the aircraft factory, and Sinas, arrived at Hongqiao Airport one after another at about 5:30 a.m. yesterday morning to inspect and organize aircraft parts. President Wang, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and his secretary, Li Haoju, and his wife, arrived at the airport at 6:05 a.m. Minister Song, accompanied by Huang Chundao, secretary of the Ministry of Finance, arrived at the airport at 6:15 a.m. President Wang, his wife, Minister Song, Huang Chundao, Li Haoju, his wife, and Nass and other six people boarded the plane one after another, driven by Mao Bangchu, and took off for Beijing at 6:25 a.m. It is expected that they will arrive in Beijing at about 8:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>President Wang's Talk</h3>
<p>According to President Wang, he told reporters at the airport that he would return to Beijing this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) to attend the temporary meeting of the Central Standing Committee and report on the reasons and process of his resignation. If time permits, he will go to Lushan with Minister Song this afternoon to pay respects to Chairman Lin and meet with Chairman Chiang to discuss everything in person.</p>
<p>▲ Successor</p>
<p>I think Mr. Cai Yuanpei is the most suitable candidate for the successor to the President of the Executive Yuan. I visited Mr. Cai twice yesterday morning and evening to ask him to take on the arduous task. Although Mr. Cai expressed his humility, he did not firmly decline. The issue of this successor will be decided after consultation with Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang in Lu. As for myself, I will never return to my post to avoid giving others an excuse.</p>
<p>▲ Political Affairs</p>
<p>Central government affairs have not been suspended due to the resignation of the President of the Executive Yuan. According to law, the resignation of the President of the Executive Yuan can be replaced by the Vice President. If the Vice President cannot replace him, the Minister of the Interior will concurrently replace him, or one of the ministers will be elected to take charge. For example, at yesterday's (i.e., the day before yesterday's) meeting of the Executive Yuan, the ministers elected Minister He as the chairman. This time, Vice President Song returned to Beijing. Before the candidate for the President of the Executive Yuan is determined, he must concurrently serve as the President of the Executive Yuan according to law. As for the change of the President of the Executive Yuan this time, the ministers will not change, because according to the responsible cabinet system, if the policy cannot be implemented, the entire cabinet will resign, but it will never advance or retreat together because of the departure or stay of the President of the Executive Yuan. However, one or two ministers have repeatedly asked to resign, or they will be allowed to leave their posts.</p>
<p>▲ Northeast Problem</p>
<p>The problem of blockading the Northeast Customs has not been suspended due to the resignation of the President of the Executive Yuan and is still in the planning process. Foreign rumors say that the Japanese side takes the tariffs of Dalian Customs as an exchange condition, and the problem of Northeast Customs has been resolved, which is completely untrue. The proposition we currently hold is just like what France said to Germany in the past: "You have the ability to take it, and I will never give it." Japan comes to "take" is one problem, and whether we "give" or "not give" is another problem. Japan comes to "take," and we must resist to prevent it from "taking" and never "give." If our resistance cannot prevent it from "taking," this is something that cannot be helped. Japan comes to take our Northeast Customs, which is Japan's problem. However, we will never give it and must resist to prevent it from taking it. This is our problem. It is heard that the Rehe authorities have recently acted to destroy the Volunteer Army, and the police of the puppet state have already occupied three miles of land inside Shanhaiguan. This kind of news is extremely painful, because we can never give the land to the Japanese and must try our best to resist to prevent them from taking it.</p>
<h3>Huang Bingheng Was Summoned to Fly to Lushan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Huang Bingheng, director of the Aviation Administration, recently came to Shanghai to work and planned to go abroad to inspect the aviation industry in Europe and the United States. Yesterday morning, Huang received a telegram from Chairman Chiang in Lushan, saying that there was an important matter to be discussed. Huang was ordered to fly to Lushan to meet Chairman Chiang yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Customs Inspection of Domestic Port Goods: Shipping Companies Strongly Oppose</h3>
<p>After the domestic port ships in Shanghai loaded import and export goods, the cent tax was abolished last year, and no tax was levied, and the goods were also exempted from inspection. Recently, the Jianghai Customs suddenly announced that all domestic port goods must be inspected and imposed huge fines on the Datada's unified tax on native cloth that was leaked from inspection, which aroused the opposition of all shipping companies in Shanghai. The situation is quite激昂. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Tax Exemption Measures</p>
<p>It is customary for ships traveling to domestic ports to be managed by the Jianghai Customs together with civilian ships. The imported goods reported and loaded have always been subject to simple inspection procedures by the South City Shipping Association at the Datada Wharf, and the goods are reported by the shipping company on its behalf, and the summary sheet is submitted to the Customs for inspection. This has been followed for a long time. On June 1 last year, the Ministry of Finance ordered that all 50-mile regular customs be cancelled, renamed branches, and all taxes were exempted. Import and export goods only need to be reported and do not need to be inspected. Shipping has been very convenient for a year.</p>
<p>▲ New Customs Inspection Rules</p>
<p>On June 23 this year, the General Tax Department instructed that all domestic port ships entering and leaving the port must be inspected. Export goods must not be loaded on ships before inspection, and import goods must not be unloaded ashore in advance before inspection. Imports on Sundays and closing days are allowed to be unloaded in advance except for livestock and fresh goods. All other goods are allowed to be unloaded in the Qianfang and wait for inspection the next day. All must abide by this.</p>
<p>▲ Datada Fine</p>
<p>After the fact was implemented, on July 30, the first iron barge of Datada Company, Hengda, transported various goods from Tongzhou. Among them, there were 200 pieces of native cloth with a unified tax bill. At 11:00 a.m., someone came to Hengda to inspect. The workers and boatmen mistakenly thought it was a customs officer inspecting. And the cloth customers wanted to take it away urgently because the goods were crowded and the tide was falling. The workers thought that the inspection had been completed and allowed them to be picked up. At 3:30 p.m., the customs inspector came to find out that the person who came to inspect first was a member of the Unified Tax Bureau, and there was no way to bring back what had been taken away. The Customs considered it a violation of the regulations and fined 200 taels of silver. Datada stated the misunderstanding and requested exemption from the fine, but it was not approved.</p>
<p>▲ Shipping Companies Oppose</p>
<p>This time, all the shipping companies in Shanghai's domestic port shipping companies, such as Zhenda, Datada, Datong, Jufeng, etc., convened a meeting and unanimously stated that the import and export of domestic port ships are all opened on the same day, and the minimum time to stay is short. When imported goods arrive at the wharf, they must be rushed to pick up, and livestock and fresh goods are especially easy to die and rot. It is extremely difficult to inspect import goods. If unloading is not allowed before inspection, it is actually very difficult to handle. Moreover, the goods are piled up in one place in the ship's cabin, which is messy and cluttered. Inspection takes time, and there is only one customs officer. If you want to inspect a large number of ships, you will not come to inspect until 3:00 or 4:00 p.m. It is inevitable that the ship will not be able to clear customs on the same day because of the inspection, and who will be responsible for the loss of the ship's schedule? If the import goods can be inspected before 3:00 or 4:00 p.m., the export goods will not be able to catch up with the loading. If passengers and goods are stranded and want to be loaded, and the ship cannot be opened, isn't it because of this that they will fall into a dilemma? Moreover, the inspection is only based on personal intentions, without any clear written regulations, and there is no preparation at all, which is especially painful.</p>
<p>▲ Request to Cancel</p>
<p>The Shanghai Aviation Association stated in detail that the inspection of import and export goods in inland rivers is extremely difficult to handle in fact, and that Datada barges holding unified tax bills have never been inspected, which has become a custom. This matter was also due to a misunderstanding. With regard to goods that do not need to be taxed, the Customs now makes a rash decision based on a notice, regardless of whether there are any obstacles or whether the shipping companies can comply with it, and forcibly fines huge sums of money for goods that do not need to be taxed. Is this not a case of harsh government being fiercer than a tiger? Merchants will not be in danger. The Customs has not yet gained any benefits, but the shipping companies have already suffered losses. Is this what the government should do when it is advocating to restore shipping rights and promote shipping? This matter is a pain in the flesh for domestic port shipping companies. For this reason, we request the Aviation Association to quickly forward it to the Jianghai Customs to immediately cancel the inspection of imports and exports in domestic ports to facilitate shipping. (Omitted below) It is also heard that if the shipping companies do not achieve their goals, they will make a final and determined statement.</p>
<h3>Naval Vessels Arrive from Japan Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Carrying a Batch of Ammunition</p>
<p>▲A Puppet State Advisor Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Forces already number over two thousand eight hundred men. Yesterday, the Japanese Navy dispatched another three hundred and fifty naval infantrymen from Sasebo. They were transported to Shanghai on the transport ship "Hoto". The ship arrived at the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu at 8:00 AM yesterday, and the soldiers disembarked and immediately went to the headquarters of the Hongkou Naval Landing Forces, where they were assigned to various units as replacements. These soldiers are for troop rotation purposes, so tomorrow (the 19th), three hundred Japanese Naval Landing Forces soldiers in Shanghai will return to Japan on the Hoto. This time, the Hoto also carried a large amount of munitions and ammunition, which were unloaded at the new warehouse at the Osaka Wharf.</p>
<p>The puppet state of Manchukuo has certain matters to discuss with the Japanese military and political authorities in Shanghai. They have specially sent advisor Shunichi Harada, a Japanese national, from Changchun via Dalian to Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Harada's activities in Shanghai have been very discreet. He has already met with Yano. Harada is staying at No. 8 Lichar Road. Puppet state officials consider Harada the first person to come to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Retailers Should Clearly Mark the Origin of Goods</h3>
<p>▲The Best Way to Boycott Japanese Goods</p>
<p>▲A Westerner's Letter Published in the "Continental Daily News"</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Westerner, Mr. Walrer C. Youngs, sent a letter to the "Continental Daily News" stating that after Japan loses its huge market in China, its military adventures in China will become financially impossible due to the import surplus. However, radical and forced boycotts of Japanese goods can easily provoke incidents. If the public's patriotic sentiment is used to vigorously oppose aggressive countries, they will eventually succumb. In short, the power to control life and death rests with the end-users, not with wholesalers and importers. Unfortunately, today's consumers often do not know the origin of goods when purchasing them. However, the remedy is very simple and cannot be opposed by Japan or other countries. All public associations, business firms, and groups across the country only need to agree that all retail goods must be marked with their place of origin, such as "Made in USA", "Made in England", or "Made in Japan". At that time, the power will be transferred to the Chinese people. If the people do not buy Japanese goods for any reason, they can prevent retailers from continuing to purchase Japanese goods from wholesalers. Then, other foreign merchants can take the opportunity to fill the gap created by this legitimate boycott, and Japan will have to abandon its illusions. The international banditry behavior they are engaging in is no longer appropriate for the present time and was abandoned in the 19th century.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commercial Revival Association Speculates on Merchants' Psychology</h3>
<p>▲Proposes Two Ways to Deal with the "Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad"</p>
<p>According to the Shih Wen News Agency, since the Shanghai War settlement was officially signed, various Japanese commercial organizations in Shanghai have organized a Commercial Revival Committee to plan for commercial recovery. They also appointed representatives Yuukichi Hayashi, Masataka Mimura, Zenji Izumi, Rokuzaburo Shiraishi, and others to return to Japan to petition their government, requesting compensation of 7.5 million yuan for the losses caused by the invasion of Shanghai. However, they have not yet received a satisfactory response from the government, so Yuukichi Hayashi and others are still staying in Tokyo, awaiting the government's final reply. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, the committee convened a meeting at the conference room of the Japanese Residents' Association to seek a quick solution to this issue. Because Chairman Yuukichi Hayashi had not returned from Japan, Consul-General Murai, stationed in Shanghai, was publicly elected as chairman. The meeting ended at 9:00 PM. It is reported that, in addition to sending another telegram to the representatives petitioning in Japan, Yuukichi Hayashi and others, urging them to actively liaise with all sectors in the country and request the government to quickly compensate the Chinese merchants for losses in Shanghai, they also decided to draft a declaration and a policy for the revival of trade with China. As for how to deal with the activities of the "Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad", the committee also proposed two methods, positive and negative. Because Consul-General Murai will leave office and return to his country at the end of this month, all the above documents are prepared to be taken back to his country by Murai and presented to the government for review. The Shih Wen News Agency reporter, in order to clarify the content of the two measures, negative and positive, proposed by the Japanese Commercial Revival Committee at the meeting to deal with the activities of the "Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad", tried to find out the content as follows:</p>
<p>▲Negative Aspect: Chinese merchants have always held the principle of high profits. This can be confirmed in previous movements to boycott Japanese goods. Now, Chinese merchants are withdrawing goods one after another due to the activities of the "Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad". We merchants should urgently seek all practical methods to remedy this situation, and we should not be afraid to sacrifice capital and allow goods to pile up. The tentatively drafted negative remedies are as follows: (1) Increase the commission to make Chinese brokers loyal to their duties and able to find ways to sell the goods they are responsible for. Therefore, we should immediately decide to increase their commission to 40% (for example, if the price of the goods is 100 yuan, then the commission is 40 yuan). In this way, we can ensure that Chinese brokers will not avoid difficulties or dangers and will do their best to sell the goods. (2) Reduce costs. Most Chinese merchants are greedy for high profits. If we can reduce the cost of various goods as much as possible and trade with them, they will be happy to do so. Even if the "Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad" is active, it will not shake the foundation of their trade with us. For example, if the cost of a certain item, including shipping, tariffs, and other miscellaneous expenses, actually exceeds three francs, we may as well reduce the selling price to two and a half francs. Although the capital has been sacrificed, this is the only way to make Chinese merchants happy to sell. (3) Be responsible for delivery. The activity of the "Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad" has made Chinese merchants who sell our goods feel disheartened. If the goods are intercepted by these people on the way, not only will the capital be completely sacrificed, but they will also be accused of being traitors. Therefore, if we want to restore the sale of goods, we should set up a delivery department to be responsible for delivering the goods to the Chinese merchant's receiving point. As for the method of sales, we should also provide guidance to strengthen their determination to sell.</p>
<p>▲Positive Aspect: Protecting the foreign trade of overseas Chinese merchants is the responsibility of the local military and political authorities. The government should also provide practical assistance. The "Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad" has been active everywhere for more than a month. In this month or so, the losses suffered by our overseas Chinese merchants in various places have been shocking, and we have not yet heard that the government and the military and political authorities in Shanghai have lodged a practical protest with the Chinese municipal government to stop and ban them, sitting idly by as the business of overseas Chinese merchants declines day by day. Now, in order to remedy the situation, (1) the government authorities should directly lodge a serious protest with the Chinese government, and at the same time, strictly order the consuls stationed in various places to immediately negotiate with the highest local Chinese authorities if they find the "Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad" and to take effective measures to protect the foreign trade of the local overseas Chinese merchants. (2) The severe decline in foreign trade is enough to shake the foundation of the domestic economy. Therefore, if the negotiation is ineffective and the "Blood Soul Anti-Treason Squad" is still rampant everywhere, further measures should be taken to protect the interests of overseas Chinese merchants and at the same time consolidate the foundation of the domestic economy. As for what the effective methods are, the government should solemnly decide.</p>
<h3>Japanese Trample on Northeastern Compatriots; All Sectors of Shanghai Form Refugee Relief Association</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that people in the northeastern provinces have been ruined and suffered unspeakable suffering since being trampled on by the Japanese, leading figures from all walks of life in Shanghai initiated the Northeast Relief Association last month, including Zhu Qinglan, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Jingcai, Xu Jiqing, Du Yuesheng, Chen Zhesheng, and Zha Liangzhao, to actively raise funds and remit them for relief. Various industry groups in Shanghai have expressed their approval and enthusiastically contributed, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tax Police Special Service Regiment Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Stationed in the Southern Shanghai Area</p>
<p>The Tax Police Special Service Regiment of the Ministry of Finance, formerly stationed in Jiaxing, has now been ordered to move to southern Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration specially prepared two special trains with twenty-five cars to transport the entire regiment of more than 1,500 people. They arrived at the South Station at 11:00 AM. After the regiment got off the train, they walked to the old barracks of Gaochang Temple to temporarily station there, responsible for maintaining security in the southern Shanghai area.</p>
<h3>Correspondence Between the Former Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association and the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>▲August 5th, Maintenance Association's Telegram to Commander Cai: Honorable Commander Cai of the 19th Route Army in Zhangzhou, [illegible text], the former Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association, together with the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association, initiated the fundraising of anti-Japanese donations and purchased goods to be transferred to your army for separate inspection and acceptance. The approximate details have been published in the newspapers, and you are invited to take note. Now, we understand that special commemorative badges are being made for those who donated to the army. The aforementioned donations involve approximately 3,000 households. All are sincere and righteous actions, and should be given badges to commemorate them. We propose to telegraph your army's office in Shanghai, with the receipts issued by the Bankers' Association to each household, to distribute the badges according to the regulations to avoid anyone being left out. We respectfully request your approval and implementation, and hope for your reply. The former Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association.</p>
<p>▲August 10th, Second Telegram to Commander Cai: Honorable Commander Cai of the 19th Route Army in Zhangzhou, [illegible text], in the previous telegram, the former Shanghai Local Maintenance Association, together with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association, raised anti-Japanese donations and purchased goods to be transferred to your army for inspection and acceptance. We proposed that commemorative badges be given to each household, but we have not received a reply. Now, the households are inquiring one after another, and this matter cannot be delayed. We earnestly request you to review the previous telegram and telegraph the Shanghai office to distribute commemorative badges based on the receipts issued by the Bankers' Association to show fairness. We urge you to implement this quickly and await your reply. The former Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association.</p>
<p>▲August 9th, Cai's Telegram from Zhangzhou to the Maintenance Association, Mr. Shi Liangcai of the Shen Bao, the telegram was received. The commemorative badges for the anti-Japanese contributors have been instructed to be handled by Director Zhuang and others at our Shanghai office. Please contact them directly for settlement. Cai Tingkai bows respectfully.</p>
<p>▲August 12th, Second Telegram from Cai in Zhangzhou to the Maintenance Association, Mr. Shi Liangcai of the Shen Bao, the telegram was received. Regarding the commemorative badges for the contributors who supported the anti-Japanese cause, the remittance was received and replied to in the previous telegram, and at the same time, our army's office in Shanghai was ordered to handle the matter accordingly. A special reply, I hope you will take note of it. Cai Tingkai respectfully.</p>
<h3>Little White Dragon Attacks Changchun Telegraph</h3>
<p>The representative of the Mongolian border cavalry commander received a telegram from Beiping yesterday, which stated that the telegram was relayed from Beiping to Changchun on the 12th. The volunteer army leader Little White Dragon previously led his troops of more than 3,000 men to attack the Japanese army. However, due to the severance of reinforcements, he hid in Datun and other places to wait for an opportunity. Recently, due to the uprisings from all sides and the successive offensives, Little White Dragon was reorganized by the Mongolian border cavalry army's patriotic army commander Cheng Changkui into the commander-in-chief of the plainclothes team, and ordered to take the opportunity to attack. Now, Little White Dragon has ordered his troops to go to Changchun to attack, and secretly ordered many capable soldiers to sneak into the city to respond. They came into contact with the Japanese army in the early hours of the day before yesterday, and a bloody battle broke out between the two sides. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and Little White Dragon's troops won a great victory. The puppet state's capital was extremely shaken, and people were panicked, startled several times in one night. The Japanese and puppet troops are now making every effort to be on guard.</p>
<h3>Radio Donations for Northeastern Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>▲Can Be Sent to New China Bank</p>
<p>Formerly, colleagues from the radio station and the education sector, considering that the northeastern volunteer army is far apart from each other, the transportation is inconvenient, the news is slow, which greatly affects the military, so they plan to set up a radio communication team to assist the northeastern volunteer army, so that military news can be obtained quickly and help contact. They have consulted with the Shanghai branch of the Technical Cooperation Association and drafted a plan to raise donations. On the one hand, they entrusted the New China Trust and Savings Bank as a collection agency, and established a special account for northeastern aid funds. However, the planned expenses are quite large, and donations take time. It is only possible to purchase six radio sets first with the available funds and send them by radio operators and mechanics for application. However, the volunteer army's battle line is vast, and it is difficult to achieve the effect of arms and fingers without three or four times the number of radios. Therefore, after the establishment of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, the original initiators agreed with it that the donations received by the bank would still be used entirely to subsidize the Northeast Volunteer Army's radio communication team. It is hoped that patriotic people from all walks of life will continue their efforts and enthusiastically donate. All donations related to this item can be sent directly to the New China Bank on Jiangxi Road, so that they can continue to purchase machines and transport them out of the customs to benefit the military, and also live up to the appeal of the station's colleagues.</p>

<h3>Two Organizations Generously Donate Huge Sums to Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received letters from two organizations yesterday, generously donating huge sums as follows:</p>
<p>▲Ningbo Association, the Ningbo Shanghai Association's letter to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association says, respectfully, after deliberation by our association's committee, it was decided to donate $2,000, of which $500 will be used as membership fees for the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, and the remaining funds will be used to aid the Volunteer Army outside the customs. The funds have been handed over to the Bank of China for collection, and Zhang Shenzhi and Ren Jinping have been appointed as representatives to attend your association's meetings and Zhang Shenzhi has been designated as a standing committee member of the management committee. Please note, it is said.</p>
<p>▲Rugao National Salvation Association's letter says, respectfully, recently, the Northeast Volunteer Army fought fiercely with the Japanese invaders, and its momentum is huge, and victories have been seen repeatedly. If we, the people of all provinces, can give them appropriate assistance, so that they can fight for a long time and work hard to the end, then the restoration of Liaoning and Jilin can be expected soon. Our association is a group of people in Rugao and was organized in response to the times to raise national salvation funds. Its only purpose is for the cause of national salvation. A meeting was previously convened to decide to remit funds to the Northeast to aid the volunteer army. Because we saw that your association is the rear support for the Northeast Volunteer Army, we have sent a letter asking for instructions on how to remit funds. We then received a reply and then the 10th Joint Meeting of the Executive Supervisory Committee of our association decided to allocate $1,000 from the case to be remitted by the Rugao Farmers Bank to the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, the designated receiving place of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, and we have sent a letter to the support association asking for verification and issuance of receipts. We have recorded the details in the minutes, and we hereby send a special letter, hoping that your association will take note of it.</p>
<h3>The Management Committee of the Defense Corps Holds a Citywide Corps Affairs Conference</h3>
<p>The Management Committee of the Shanghai Defense Corps convened a corps affairs conference of the leaders of the various district corps of the city on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The chiefs and deputy chiefs of the various district corps attended unanimously. Committee members Luo Jingyou, Yao Mulian, Wang Binyan, Wen Yingxing, Wang Yansong, and new committee member Zhang Yanrong also attended. Chairman Luo You presided over the meeting. At the beginning of the meeting, the chairman introduced the various district corps to Committee Member Zhang. Then, he gave a speech, saying that the corps affairs conference was still in its early stages. The association convened this meeting during a time when the disaster was not yet over, because of the various important relationships. The district corps should be under one system and have a unified method, and the situation in Shanghai, including the rural areas, is complex, so it is necessary to concentrate opinions at any time. Therefore, the corps affairs conference is necessary. Furthermore, after this war, the Shanghai Defense Corps suffered great losses in the war zone, and those outside the war zone were also affected. At that time, I was publicly elected to preside over the association's affairs. I originally planned to convene a meeting immediately, but I was all still recovering from the disaster and had no time to arrange things properly. Furthermore, the situation of the losses and effects had not been thoroughly investigated and reviewed, which was insufficient to clarify the situation and prepare for reorganization. Therefore, a questionnaire on the uniforms, firearms, and various items of officers and employees was made and sent to various district corps for review and submission. Then, the association sent staff to each district to verify the actual situation on the ground. At present, the verification of each corps in the non-war zone has been completed. The verification of each corps in the war zone is more difficult, and there are still two places that have not arrived. Once they are urged to attend the meeting, staff can be sent to verify them. This is one of the main reasons why the corps affairs conference was delayed. At that time, the organization of the Security Office already had a motive. The mayor was extremely interested in establishing an entire method for the Defense Corps. The association was deeply afraid that at this juncture, the planning of branches and sections would only increase the trouble of reorganization. Therefore, we conducted our own investigation and reorganization, and waited quietly for the government's orders to avoid too much change in order to be realistic. This is another reason for the delayed convocation. Now, the Security Office has been established, and the Defense Corps has been placed under its jurisdiction. The system has been determined. However, local autonomy is still in the preparatory stage, and it is feared that the organization of the corps defense will not be able to be changed for a while. The mayor attaches great importance to the Defense Corps and has also adopted false voices from various provinces and requested rules and regulations. We should actively organize to achieve perfection, which can be modeled and promoted throughout the country. This is to live up to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's earnest expectations for reorganization and to answer the elegance of the various provinces and cities' adoption and rejection. All these kinds of things have a great relationship with the corps affairs conference, so no matter how hot it is, we have to convene it immediately. You have all done a good job in managing the corps defense. I hope that you will express your great views and plan for progress together, it is said. Next, the report on the preparation of the budget for the 21st year was made, and the various district corps were asked to report in detail the location of each team and defense post. Then, the Chief Secretary Qian Zhuyu and the Chief Instructor reported on the verification situation and the points that should be paid attention to in training and storing firearms. Then, the discussion of each case began. (Case 1) How should the various district teams assist the police and how should they cooperate with the local Public Security Bureaus in each district to achieve practical cooperation? It was resolved that (1) the Defense Corps should assist as much as possible in any requests from the Public Security Bureaus in each district regarding local defense. (2) The Public Security Bureaus in each district should notify the local Defense Corps of any local security incidents in the future. (3) If the Public Security Bureau arrests a member of the corps because of a case, except for cases in which the offender is in the act or there is a special urgent situation and there is no time to notify the commander in charge, the others should be notified in advance to avoid misunderstandings. (4) The leaders of the Defense Corps in each district should contact the Public Security Bureau in each district at any time to avoid separation. The above methods, with the opinions put forward by the various district corps, were approved by the Committee Member Wen Jian and unanimously passed. (Case 2) The various district corps requested that the original funds be restored from the 21st year to maintain them. It was resolved that the funds for the Shanghai Defense Corps are extremely small. The original subsidies were already insufficient to cover the costs, and after tightening them, it became even more difficult. For several months, we have been exhausted and unable to support ourselves. Now that the Municipal Committee Office and the Fire Brigade have been restored to their original state, it is difficult for our association to be left out. We should immediately report the difficulties and request the municipal government to approve the allocation according to the new budget from the 21st year. (Case 3) How should the training methods of the various district teams be planned and carried out? It was resolved that the chief and deputy instructors will convene the instructors of the various district corps regularly to discuss together, to formulate detailed methods for unified passwords and exercises, and to review and approve the reward and punishment regulations before implementing them. (Case 4) Regarding the organization of firearms in the various district corps, (1) What is the minimum number of firearms that each team should have, and how should the deficiency be supplemented? (2) How should the methods of use and preservation be regulated? (3) How should the firearms of members of the corps who have left each district corps for various reasons be handled? It was resolved that: 1. The minimum number should be half the number of members of the corps (regardless of the type of gun). The deficiency should be raised by the local area as much as possible. If it is still insufficient, report it to the municipal government for approval. 2. The coaching stock of this association collects opinions and drafts methods of use and storage, and issues them for compliance. 3. The firearms prepared by the members of the group have been stamped and chiseled by the Defense Group, regardless of whether they are retired or not, they should be left in the group for use. If the member withdraws legally, and voluntarily donates the self-provided firearms, he should immediately report to the superior authority and give rewards, otherwise the group will give a price as appropriate. If the firearms are confiscated due to dismissal, the reasons should be stated in detail and submitted to the superiors for investigation and approval. (Case 5) Regarding the replenishment of uniforms in the various district corps and the methods for using them, it was resolved that the various district corps should first find ways to raise funds themselves, report and wait for approval. If it is still insufficient, then apply to the municipal government for funds to purchase them. The methods for using them will be drafted by the association and ordered to be followed. (Case 6) The procedures for transferring officers and the methods for admitting members of the various district corps are not consistent. How should they be regulated and organized? It was resolved that the Management Committee will formulate regulations for the appointment and removal of officers and order them to be followed. Before the promulgation, if there is any transfer of officers in the various district corps, it should be reported to the association first before approval. As for the admission and retirement of members of the corps, the original methods should be followed temporarily and handled seriously. If there are any inconsistencies with the procedures, they should be reorganized immediately. (Case 7) The official documents between this association and the various district corps should be concise, easy, and convenient. How should the format be improved? It was resolved that the format will be stipulated by the association and ordered to be followed. (Case 8) How should the troops be selected to participate in the Mayor's Double Ten Day inspection? It was resolved that the members of the corps with complete equipment should be selected by each district corps to prepare for training in advance so as to be assembled and organized and go to participate. The training methods will be discussed and decided by the coaching stock. The number of troops dispatched by each district corps on the spot is as follows: 320 people in one battalion in southern Shanghai, the accommodation arrangements in northern Shanghai are to be discussed, 180 people in one team in Yangjing, 80 people in one team in Pusong, 80 people in one team in Caojing, 80 people in one team in Fahua, and one platoon can be sent in Jiangwan if necessary, and Pengpu can be increased to two platoons. (Case 9) The loss of the teams in the war zone is huge. How should they be supplemented to restore them and benefit the local area? It was resolved that the various district corps should report the details of the losses and the minimum necessary restoration to the association, which will be forwarded to the municipal government and the war zone relief committee to request funds to be allocated for replenishment.</p>
<h3>The Songhu Railway Cannot Be Handed Over to the City</h3>
<p>▲Ministry of Railways Sends Personnel to Shanghai to State Reasons</p>
<p>▲Also Discusses the Restoration of the Two Railways</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway being transferred to the city government, after the Shanghai Municipal Government submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Railways convened a meeting and discussed it strictly. The Municipal Government also specially sent the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Huang Boqiao and the Director of the Public Works Bureau Shen Yi to Jinan to participate. It is reported that the Ministry of Railways does not seem to be able to approve the city government's request because the railway has various relationships. Yesterday, the Ministry of Railways specially sent Commissioner Li Fanghua and Section Chief Ding Qi to Shanghai to visit Mayor Wu to state the reasons why it could not be handed over to the city. It is also learned that the task of Li and Ding in Shanghai, in addition to this issue, is to contact the Railway Bureau to discuss the restoration of the two railways in person.</p>
<h3>The National Aviation Salvation Association Held a Review Committee Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲The Number of People Was Insufficient and a Conversation Was Temporarily Changed to</p>
<p>The Chinese National Aviation Salvation Association held a review committee at the Bankers' Association at 5 pm yesterday. Five committee members, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Rutang, Lin Kanghou, Song Yuanyuan, and Lin Wojang, attended. Because the number of people was insufficient, a conversation was changed to temporarily. Wang Xiaolai reported on the review process, and then discussed other issues, and dispersed at 7 pm.</p>
<h3>The Nitrate and Sulfur Marketing Office Declares That It Did Not Ship Inferior Goods</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Nitrate and Sulfur Marketing Office purchased a large batch of sulfur from Japanese merchants and unloaded it at Qichang Stack. The Chamber of Commerce immediately sent a letter to inquire. Now, the Marketing Office replied that it is the same for everyone to refuse to use enemy goods. Moreover, our office is a government-run institution. Since the Northeast Incident occurred last year, our office took the lead in promoting the purchase of domestically produced sulfur to resist Japanese sulfur. Currently, our office uses Xiang Sulfur, which is purchased from the Xiang Sulfur Marketing Office, and is ordered by the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs to permanently purchase it in the future. The other is Yi Sulfur, which is used to supplement the insufficient application of domestic sulfur. It is purchased from Yihua and other foreign firms. The facts are all there and can be verified.</p>
<h3>He Yaozu Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>He Yaozu left Beijing by night train yesterday and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<h3>A Good Opportunity to Promote Domestic Goods in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting Domestic Goods and Tian Yi Wei Mother Company have jointly organized the Guanghua Trading Company, which is highly beneficial for promoting overseas trade of domestic goods. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to affiliated factories and members to assist in the endeavor. The notice stated:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of notification, according to a letter from our member, Tian Yi Wei Mother Company, Mr. Gan Juyuan was specially dispatched last year to the Southeast Asian archipelago to promote domestic goods and foster relationships. He was honored to receive sincere welcome from overseas Chinese in various locations, who expressed enthusiastic support for domestic products, representing an excellent opportunity for expanding overseas trade. Mr. Gan's journey to Southeast Asia revealed that many Hakka people wished for our factory to establish a representative office in Shanghai to handle the export of domestic goods and the import of local products. While our factory is inherently unable to manage this concurrently, we felt compelled by circumstances to establish the Guanghua Trading Company, willing to serve the domestic goods industry. We plan to initially focus on Surabaya, Batavia, Longchuan, Makassar in the Dutch East Indies, as well as Burma and Annam. As this is a new endeavor, we are determined to succeed. Therefore, we are writing to your association, requesting you to inform all factories that if they require our services, we will serve them with utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the letter, we have observed that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are enthusiastic about their motherland and deeply concerned about domestic goods. Promoting these products is bound to yield significant results. This factory possesses far-sighted vision and courageous spirit in establishing the Guanghua Trading Company to serve domestic goods factories, promote Chinese goods, and safeguard common interests. We deeply admire their dedication.</p>
<p>We are recording the letter and sending it to your members in the aforementioned locations. If you do not have a formal agent and wish to promote your products, please prepare samples and price lists and directly contact the company at Tian Yi General Distributor, No. 234 Zhifu Road, Shanghai (telephone number 11832), where you will find excellent and convenient solutions. We hope you will take note of this.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Industry Welcomes Representatives of the Guangdong National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Domestic Goods Factories held a banquet yesterday at Guanshengyuan to welcome Ma Huayi, a representative from the Guangdong People's National Salvation Association, who came to Shanghai to investigate whether the products of Jiuji Cane Factory were domestic goods. The investigation has been completed. More than twenty people attended the banquet. Lu Xingzhuang stated that Jiuji's products were sold and transported to Guangdong by Yongyuan Trading Company and were mistakenly identified as Japanese goods and detained. Various organizations jointly sent letters requesting their release. To ensure diligence, the Guangdong People's National Salvation Association dispatched representative Ma Huayi to Shanghai for detailed investigation. It has now been confirmed that they are domestic goods, hence this welcome. Zhang Zilian, Yin Zhiling, and others then delivered speeches. Representative Ma stated that his trip to Shanghai not only confirmed that Jiuji's goods were domestic goods, but also allowed him to visit various factories and gain a first-hand understanding of domestic goods, which exceeded his expectations. Upon returning to Guangdong, he will ensure that Jiuji's goods are released.</p>
<h3>Domestic Goods Exhibition Hall Requests to Hold an Exhibition</h3>
<h3>Encouraging Domestic Production to Save the Nation ... Promoting Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Cao Zhendong, the curator of the Municipal Domestic Goods Exhibition Hall, stated that last year's exhibition was interrupted due to the floods in various provinces and the disaster in Dong Province. After the cessation of hostilities this year, it is imperative to uphold the principle of encouraging domestic production to save the nation. A grand exhibition and mobile exhibition should be held during the Double Ten Festival to promote domestic goods. He submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, which was forwarded to the Municipal Government for review and approval, so that preparations can begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Issues Circular Regarding Misrepresentation of Guang Yi Factory Goods</h3>
<h3>Replies Separately to the Conscience National Salvation Corps</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a circular yesterday to national civil organizations regarding the sale of cotton cloth by Yuanxiang Cotton Cloth Store under the name of Changshu Guang Yi Factory to deceive customers. It also replied separately to the Conscience National Salvation Corps regarding a certain printing and dyeing company. The original telegram and letter are as follows:</p>
<h3>Telegram to Various Civil Organizations. For the Attention of National Civil Organizations. Our association previously received a report stating that Yuanxiang Cotton Cloth Store, located at the first house in Lane 2 of Yuyin Lane, West Shilu, Beijing Road, frequently imports large quantities of Japanese goods or affixes labels claiming genuine domestic goods or products of Changshu Guang Yi Factory in an attempt to deceive customers. After entrusting the investigation to the Cotton Cloth Trade Association, we visited the store yesterday under the pretext of brokering goods and found six single packages of fine twill and hundreds of bolts of Yuanzhi tribute cloth with the Guang Yi Factory three-star trademark. However, after investigation, it was found that there is no Guang Yi Factory in Changshu. There is only a Guang Yi Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Changzhou. Yuanxiang Store's use of Guang Yi for Guang Yi clearly indicates intentional misrepresentation and there is no doubt that they are relabeling enemy goods. We urge civil organizations in various regions to immediately intercept and investigate any products claiming to be from Guang Yi Factory with the three-star trademark to prevent confusion. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</h3>
<h3>Letter to the Conscience National Salvation Corps. For the attention of the Conscience National Salvation Corps. We have received your letter and are fully aware of its contents. You mention that certain large printing and dyeing companies and certain large dyeing and weaving factories have printing machines but no weaving machines, or that even a few factories with some weaving machines produce a quantity of goods that is disproportionate to the amount woven. However, their trademarks are all registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and have certificates of proof from our association and various domestic goods organizations, suggesting that they are genuine domestic goods. However, upon closer examination of their cloth, much of it is from Gongda and other factories, both domestic and foreign, which is deeply distressing. Our association is still conducting a detailed investigation into the matter of certain large printing and dyeing companies. If they purchase raw materials from other factories without using Japanese goods, it cannot be considered a violation of the agreement. Moreover, according to the domestic goods standards set by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, if the capital and management are Chinese, even if most of the raw materials are foreign, they are still recognized as fourth-class domestic goods. Therefore, various organizations have their reasons for issuing domestic goods certificates. However, if a company only dyes and does not weave, and yet claims to be a dyeing and weaving factory, it is close to deceiving the public. Therefore, our association has stopped issuing such certificates since this year. Regarding the certain large dyeing and weaving factory you mentioned, one of them was reported to be using Japanese yarn. After the matter was referred to the association, the company claimed to have temporarily suspended the weaving of this type of yarn. Another company is using Japanese cloth and is being warned by the association. We are providing this brief reply for your information. We hope you will understand.</h3>
<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the Woolen Fabric Factory Industry Association</h3>
<h3>Thoroughly Inspect Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Woolen Fabric Factory Industry Association held a meeting of its executive committee at its meeting place on Niuzhuang Road yesterday (the 17th) at 3:00 PM. Chen Youyun, Xu Jutang, Huang Jin Yang, Huang Zhao Chang, Jiang Zongshui, and others attended. Xu Jutang chaired the meeting, and Wang Honghui served as the recorder. The following resolutions were made:</p>
<p>(1) To set the prices of products for each factory. First-grade camel wool cloth with stripes is priced at two liang and one qian and a half per yard, and second-grade camel wool cloth is priced at one liang and eight qian. First-grade plain camel wool cloth is priced at one liang and eight qian, and second-grade camel wool cloth is priced at one liang and six qian.</p>
<p>(2) To notify all factories not to purchase Japanese goods. Any factory found privately importing Japanese goods will be immediately expelled from the association and publicly announced in the newspaper to be abandoned by the public. To also notify factory residents to thoroughly inspect whether each factory is purchasing Japanese goods, and to send letters to the dyeing industry association and labor union stating that if any factories in this industry privately entrust the dyeing of Japanese yarn to their industry, they should immediately report it to this association. If they fail to report it, once discovered, the name of the dyeing shop will be publicly announced in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(3) All customer transactions must be in cash. If promissory notes are used, the term of the note must not be too long. If there are any unpaid bills, the industry will be notified to suspend transactions with that customer until the bills are paid, in order to demonstrate mutual assistance within the industry.</p>
<p>(4) To begin collecting this year's expenses from each factory starting immediately.</p>
<p>(5) A former broker named Ye from the Silun Factory was involved in a lawsuit with the factory. Member factories are notified to refuse to hire him.</p>
<p>(6) In the future, if each factory has disputes with foreign firms over orders, this association will find a way to resolve them.</p>
<h3>Representatives from Guizhou Province Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Dismissal of Mao's Administration is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Deng Fufang, a representative sent by the Guizhou Provincial Government to report everything to Beijing, has already arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to an interview with a reporter from Huadong News Agency, the Guizhou province held that former Chairman Mao had resigned due to fatigue, and sincerely yielded to Wang Jialie to administer Guizhou Province. Wang had declined multiple times, and obeyed the command from the central government. Since entering Guizhou, the army and the people have lived in peace. Now, military and political affairs have become on track. Even miscellaneous taxes have been investigated and rectified separately. The previously reported account of welcoming Mao's reinstatement is pure fabrication. Furthermore, Xu Qingyu, the director of the Guizhou Provincial Training Office in Beijing, issued a grey telegram yesterday, saying that various Shanghai newspapers have reported that Wang Jialie welcomed Mao back to Guizhou to lead the administration, which is purely unfounded. It is possible that evil people deliberately fabricated rumors. A few months ago, Mao agreed to visit the quiet and scenic Xishan of Xifeng with local gentry for rest and recuperation, with the agreement of Lie beforehand, without any political intention. Lie went to welcome Mao back to Guizhou to avoid rumors because Xie left his original defense without permission. There is no intention to elect him as the head of the administration. Moreover, Mao has been in politics for many years, working day and night, and is already tired and unwilling to deal with complex affairs again. Please, brother, convey this situation to all parties and notify all newspapers to correct the report to avoid false rumors.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers Entering Guan from Northeast Request Exemption from Transfer to the South</h3>
<p>After the postal service in Northeast China was sealed off, postal workers, unwilling to be employed by the puppet government, all defected to Guan Nei. Many of them reported to the Pingjin districts. Recently, the postal authorities distributed these employees to serve in the Suzhou, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, and other districts. However, most of the postal workers entering Guan from Northeast China have meager salaries, and the cost of living in the South is higher. If transferred to the South, it would be difficult for them to make a living. Therefore, they have requested the National Postal Workers' Federation to negotiate with the General Administration to request that the Northeast workers be allowed to serve in the Pingjin or Jiangbei districts.</p>
<h3>Sanyou Factory Workers Organize a Hunger Strike Group</h3>
<h3>To Declare a Hunger Strike Today</h3>
<p>The shutdown dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Society General Factory in Yinxiang Port has lasted for more than half a year without resolution. Repeated mediation by party and government agencies has been ineffective. It is reported that all the factory workers, finding no way to appeal and no way to make a living, have decided to organize a hunger strike group and will all begin a hunger strike today to seek the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Commerce has confirmed that Dutch merchants have excluded Yapu'er light bulbs.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of Domestic Goods and the China Domestic Goods Maintenance Association previously sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the illegal encroachment of the Dutch Philips Electric Bulb Company on the Yapu'er Electric Appliance Factory. Yesterday, we received a telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the Philips Company is using patents as an excuse to exclude our country's products, which is related to overseas trade, and will definitely find ways to protect them. However, it is necessary to investigate whether the gas bubble and glass evacuation method was invented by Philips and is patented, or whether it is a common manufacturing method for light bulbs. The Ministry has already consulted the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has replied that even if the Philips Company has a patent, it must have a fixed term and a legal basis for its rights. The Consul General in Batavia has been instructed to investigate and report to the Ministry for verification and processing. More than 20 national organizations in Hankou, Shanghai, and other places have also sent letters stating that they are willing to act as backing, actively assist, and fight together at all costs to achieve the goal of reciprocal commercial treaties and to protect overseas trade of domestic goods.</p>
<h3>Northwest Reclamation Corps Continues to Recruit New Members</h3>
<h3>Preparing for a Second Departure</h3>
<p>After the Northwest Reclamation Corps dispatched an investigation team on August 1 to Suide and Baotou in Suiyuan to conduct on-the-ground investigations for the first phase of the reclamation plan, the team has now reported that they have safely arrived in Beiping and will transfer to the Northwest for work within a few days. However, reclaiming the Northwest is a major responsibility that requires the concentration of national forces. Therefore, the corps is continuing to recruit new members to enthusiastically join in order to prepare for a second departure. The registration address is at the corps' office, Room 409, Silk Industry Building, Sanma Road, Shilu. A detailed prospectus will be sent upon receipt of two cents for postage. If you need to request a copy of the corps' monthly magazine, you will need to attach 20 cents for postage.</p>

<h3>Hu Lifu Escorted to Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Accompanied by Inspectors and Police Officers</h3>
<h3>Special Guard to put on the train last night</h3>
<p>After the leader of the Chinese traitors, Hu Lifu, was arrested by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he confessed to all the crimes during repeated interrogations by the Judicial Section. Mayor Wu Tiecheng believed that the criminal's various past crimes had repeatedly harmed the Republic of China. Because the case was serious, he telegraphed the Central Government for instructions and decided to escort the criminal to Beijing for trial. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. However, at around 10 PM on the night before last (the 16th), this newspaper suddenly received a message that "Hu Lifu was escorted to Beijing last night." The reporter specially interviewed Ding Zhibai, the director of the Judicial Section, that night, and learned that Hu had not been escorted to Beijing yet. He also said that although it had been decided to escort Hu to Beijing, it was still uncertain whether he would be escorted to the Weisu Garrison Headquarters in the capital or directly to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs. It would not be possible to escort him to Beijing until a formal reply was received from Nanjing, and it would take at least two days to do so. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Government received a reply from the Central Government yesterday, instructing them to escort the criminal to Beijing immediately and hand him over to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs for interrogation. The Municipal Government immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to immediately escort the criminal to Beijing. After receiving the order, Director Wen ordered the Trial Division of the Third Section to rush to prepare two documents, one to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs and one to the Capital Military Police Headquarters. This was completed at 4 PM. For the sake of caution along the way, Director Wen specially ordered Inspector Guo Zhenliang to cooperate with Zhu Botao, the deputy leader of the Police Brigade, to select eight police officers to escort him. He also sent Detective Team Leader Gao Wansheng, detectives Xu Ziliang, Hong Tingyi, Shi Yongquan, etc. to escort him along the train. For the sake of strict guarding, the criminal was first escorted to the Zhenru Station to wait for the 11:00 PM express train to arrive. He was escorted onto the train and went straight to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Traitors Took Advantage of the Chaos to Loot During the Shanghai War</h3>
<h3>Shen Jingen Stole an Old Car</h3>
<h3>Pushed a Victim to the Ground</h3>
<h3>Took All Belongings and Escaped Without a Trace</h3>
<h3>The Police Have Apprehended the Suspect, Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the Japanese army has sent large numbers of planes to bomb the war zone and the areas of Zhenru, Nanxiang, and Luodian, destroying civilian property. Zhou Shugui, who owned the Yuanda Xin Clothing Store in Luodian Town, was harassed by Japanese planes. On February 15th, at noon at around twelve o'clock, he hired car number 428, driven by local driver Shen Quangen, for a price of 15 silver dollars, to transport all the clothes from his store, packed into seven boxes with a value of more than 2,000 yuan, to Shanghai. Zhou alone accompanied the car. Unexpectedly, near the intersection of Bailinan Road and Yu Garden Road in western Shanghai, the driver, Shen Quangen, suddenly had an idea. At that time, the Sino-Japanese war was raging, and the area was desolate and uninhabited. Shen stopped the car, falsely claiming that the rear tire was broken and needed to be repaired. He asked Zhou to check the tire to see if it was damaged. Zhou did not know his plan and was about to get out of the car. Shen seized the opportunity and pushed Zhou hard, causing Zhou to fall off the car and onto the ground. Shen then drove the car at full speed and disappeared in an instant. Zhou then reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and requested an investigation. It was not until the other day that the police station's Chinese detective Wang Yongjun and Bao detective Wu Jiwen arrested Shen Quangen (also known as Ah Er) on Edward Road and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. According to the police station's lawyer Wang Yaotang's statement of the case, the defendant is currently being prosecuted for robbery under Article 346 of the Criminal Law, but this may need to be amended in the future. The police station's investigation revealed that the defendant was not a car driver. The car was stolen from Edward Road in January. On February 3, he stole a license plate number 4286 from Minti Niyin Road in the French Concession, removed the number 6, and hung it on the stolen car, making it number 428. He specialized in soliciting business everywhere. On February 15, the defendant took Zhou's business in Luodian and pushed Zhou off the car in the middle of the road and drove away. Now, because all the stolen goods have not been investigated, the lawyer requested an extension. According to Zhou Shugui's complaint of the above situation and the statement that it was indeed the defendant who drove the car and pushed him off, when questioned, the defendant denied it, saying that he was farming in the countryside that day and could be investigated. After the judge, Ge Shixun, reviewed the confession, he ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yamashita Kisen Kaisha Plans to Change Japanese Ships to Fly Chinese Flags</h3>
<h3>Chinese Shipping Merchants to Undertake the Matter</h3>
<h3>To Travel to Kobe to Sign a Contract</h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, the Japanese Yamashita Kisen Kaisha, located at 56 Sichuan Road, has completely suspended operations due to the boycott. It is now discussing with a Chinese shipping merchant to change the Japanese ships to fly Chinese flags in order to attract Chinese merchants. It is heard that the company's head office has summoned someone to Kobe to sign a contract with the Japanese merchants. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter is benefiting the Japanese merchants under the guise of Chinese merchants, cleverly avoiding the boycott. The intention of the perpetrators is infuriating and has sent a letter to the Shipping Association to investigate and warn them not to be exploited by the Japanese. The company has several ships that were purchased from countries such as England and France after the war. It is now also planning to find a way to request the original manufacturing countries to fly their flags in order to facilitate business. It has also specially entrusted a Chinese shipping merchant to manage the matter.</p>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Factory Inspections</h3>
<h3>Announces Initial Scope of Inspection</h3>
<p>After the promulgation and implementation of the Factory Law and the Factory Inspection Law, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has set up a special section and appointed qualified factory inspectors to conduct inspections according to the law. Just as everything was about to be completed, the January 28th Incident occurred, causing it to be suspended without implementation. Now that the ceasefire agreement has been signed and order has been restored, the bureau has actively prepared and scheduled to begin the initial inspections on September 1. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Scope of Inspection. The bureau issued a notice to all factories yesterday instructing them on the initial scope of inspection. The original order is as follows: "For compliance, this bureau has scheduled to implement the initial inspection in accordance with the provisions of the Factory Inspection Law starting on September 1. The scope is as follows: (1) Factory books. Factories should prepare a register of workers, a report form for worker injuries and illnesses, a report form for disaster events, and a report form for retired workers, and submit them to this bureau on a regular basis in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Factory Law. (2) Working hours. Worker working hours should be handled in accordance with the provisions of Articles 8 to 12 of the Factory Law. Any extension of working hours should be reported to this bureau with detailed reasons in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Implementation Regulations of the Factory Law. (3) Wages.

In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance."</h3>
<h3>Inspection Methods. The bureau will send personnel to inspect each factory. The name of the inspector and the date of inspection must be notified to the factory one week in advance. At the appointed time, the inspector will bring the forms and fill them out while inquiring and consulting the books from the factory. If necessary, workers may be summoned for questioning to obtain evidence. The factory shall fill out and report matters that should be reported in accordance with the law within a deadline determined by the inspector, and the person in charge of the factory shall sign and seal the inspection form to show solemnity. The aforementioned deadline shall not exceed the end of this year. If a factory is unable to report within the deadline set by the inspector due to special circumstances, it shall report the reasons in detail and apply for an extension. Failure to report after the deadline will be punished in accordance with the law. Inspections are usually conducted during the day, but if there are factories with night work, the inspector may also go at night if necessary.</h3>
<h3>Inspection Areas. The bureau's initial inspections are carried out in phases by area, rotating through Hunan, Longhua, Zhabei, Pusong, Jiangwan, Wusong, Pudong, and the two special districts of the Public Concession and the French Concession.

<h3>The Citizens' Association Sent a Letter to the Municipal Party Department Yesterday, Painstakingly Explaining the Pros and Cons of Reducing and Exempting Rent</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Special City Party Department yesterday regarding the reduction and exemption of rent, expressing its views sincerely and pertinently. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Respectfully presented, we have investigated that the reduction and exemption of rent in Shanghai is indeed an important plan for seeking the welfare of the masses, and it is also a long-term consideration for landlords. The situation of the city cannot be thoroughly relieved. Today's situation is a temporary relief, but tomorrow it will be a major disaster. If the department has taken this into consideration, please ask the central government to send personnel to supplement the shortfall. This is to seek the welfare of the masses. However, the landlords who are short-sighted will definitely use the municipal government's rent exemption method, regardless of the suffering of the masses, and carry out their bone-sucking behavior. They will sue in court, and the court will ignore the facts of social economy and not know the basic principle of law, "the welfare of the masses is the highest law," (Latin: Salus Populi Est Suprema Lex; English: The Welfare of the People is the Supreme Law) and dare not cite the provisions of the Civil Code on rent reduction and exemption. As a result, the commercial city will inevitably decline and perish. To that point, the landlords and tenants will perish together, and the original plan will not be reduced. In addition to the municipal government, the court will not escape its responsibility. Therefore, we specially request the department to forward a letter to the relevant court, requesting them to attach importance to the basic principles of law. When encountering rent reduction and exemption cases, the civil code's rent reduction and exemption provisions should be invoked in accordance with the law, so that the city can restore its vitality and the landlords and tenants can obtain their permanent welfare. This is a public convenience. This is presented to the Shanghai Special City Party Department of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>
<h3>The Fisheries Administration Bureau Will Establish a Shellfish Aquaculture Experimentation Field</h3>
<p>▲ Site Located in Zhenhai Bay Pond</p>
<p>The Marine Fisheries Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang regions, formerly based in this city, had all of its undertakings seemingly halted due to government austerity measures. However, various plans were still underway. Recently, they proposed establishing a shellfish aquaculture experimentation field in the Zhenhai Bay Pond. This plan has been completed and submitted to the Ministry of Industry for instructions a few days ago. Approval for commencement is expected soon. The bureau's official submission and plan are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Official Submission: Requesting Approval and Implementation of Shellfish Aquaculture Experimentation Plan and Budget</p>
<p>To comply with the order to report on the planned shellfish aquaculture experimentation, a detailed plan and budget have been prepared. We respectfully request your review and implementation. Your ministry's directive states: "Having noted your submission, the Haizhou Aquatic Product Experimentation Field is currently being prepared for restoration by the ministry. Your request to transfer it to your bureau for management is not approved. However, to improve fisheries, your bureau may first establish a shellfish aquaculture experimentation field on the originally acquired Zhenhai tidal flats. Within the scope of your bureau's organizational regulations, prepare a detailed plan and separate budget for review and approval." Respectfully, regarding the preparation of shellfish aquaculture experimentation, previous submissions have been made to your ministry, and instructions have been received and followed. At this time of strict government austerity, to comply with the order to tighten spending, we propose to temporarily designate an area of 1,000 mu within the acquired public tidal flats to initially engage in the aquaculture of razor clams and blood clams. If there are no special changes, the income should be considerable. After detailed planning, the required expenses have been reduced to 61,830 yuan, while the estimated income is approximately 84,000 yuan. This budget has been repeatedly reviewed and is truly reduced to the bare minimum. Due to the preceding order, we respectfully submit the Shellfish Aquaculture Experimentation Field Plan and Shellfish Aquaculture Experimentation Field Budget for your review and implementation. This would be greatly beneficial.</p>
<p>▲ Shellfish Aquaculture Experimentation Field Plan: (1) Organization: To save on expenses, the organization of the Shellfish Aquaculture Experimentation Field established by this bureau will be kept simple. It will consist of only one Field Director/Chief, two technicians, and twenty-one aquaculture workers, all stationed at the field to handle various affairs. (2) Site: The site of this field is located in Zhenhai Bay Pond. According to records, 7,071 mu, 7 fen, 8 li, and 4 hao of tidal flats were allocated from the old Ningbo Shatian Sub-bureau of Zhejiang last year. The soil quality is excellent, and the bait is abundant, making it very suitable for shellfish aquaculture. (3) Aquaculture Species: The aquaculture species in this field will initially be razor clams and blood clams. Other shellfish will be aquacultured when sufficient funds are available. (4) Area: The area of this field is temporarily set at 1,000 mu, with 800 mu for razor clams and 200 mu for blood clams. (5) Budget: All expenses for this field are based on a tight budget, with estimated temporary expenses of 12,350 yuan and annual recurring expenses of 49,480 yuan. The recurring budget and annual income budget are listed below: (Recurring Expenditure) Salaries: 8,400 yuan, Office Expenses: 960 yuan, Special Expenses: 39,640 yuan, Razor Clam Seedlings: 30,400 yuan, Blood Clam Seedlings: 9,000 silver dollars, Travel Expenses: 240 yuan, Contingency Fund: 480 yuan, (Temporary Expenses) Land Cost: 600 taels, Construction Cost: 3,900 yuan, Procurement Cost: 3,850 yuan, Preparation Cost: 4,000 yuan, (Recurring Income) Razor Clam Income: 7,200 yuan (800 mu, after one and a half years of aquaculture, each mu can yield about 4.5 dan of blood clams, with each dan worth about 100 yuan, totaling the above amount.), Blood Clam Income: 3,000 yuan (200 mu, after one and a half years of aquaculture, each mu can yield about 3 dan of blood clams, with each dan worth about 30 yuan, totaling the above amount.)</p>
<h3>Public Bus Company Strike Trend Becomes More Serious</h3>
<p>▲ Workers Hold a General Meeting to Discuss Solutions</p>
<p>▲ The Strike Committee Sends a Letter to the Ratepayers' Association Seeking Assistance</p>
<p>Since the public bus workers declared a strike, the situation has become increasingly serious due to the intransigent attitude of the company's Superintendent, Short. Details of yesterday's events are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Workers' General Meeting: Due to the company's tough stance and disregard for the workers' livelihoods, all workers, numbering over 200, convened a general meeting at the Renhe Teahouse on Wuding Road at 2 PM yesterday. The presidium reported on the negotiations with the drivers and resolved to request mediation from party and government authorities and to send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association for assistance to avoid a major dispute.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Ratepayers' Association: The Public Bus Strike Committee sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession, stating: "Respected Sirs, on July 25th, the company's managers, Short, Trittly, and Pear, summoned worker representatives Wang Xingmao, Shi Baoshan, and four others to the transport office for discussions. Short initially proposed improving practices due to the company's stagnant revenue, requesting that all workers refrain from malpractice. The company would increase each worker's salary by 5/10, totaling 37.5 yuan per month, up from the original 23.5 yuan. The worker representatives reported back to all workers, who were satisfied and willing to continue working. However, after Manager Trittly went to Japan on a two-week leave, entrusting all matters to Pear, Pear dismissed over 20 workers without cause after only one week in charge, shocking all workers. The original six representatives were sent to negotiate and demand the implementation of the promised salary increase, but Pear not only refused the workers' demands but also intensified the oppression, leading to an unbearable spontaneous strike. Representatives were then sent to demand that the company accept the conditions, but they were repeatedly rejected. The company now disregards the workers' suffering and is recruiting new workers, leaving the original workers with no means of support. We have nowhere to turn. Knowing that you are dedicated to protecting the interests of the Chinese and devoted to public service, we have specially dispatched Wang Xingmao, Shi Baoshan, and others as full representatives to meet with you. We humbly request your audience and ask that you have compassion for the suffering of over 300 workers, agreeing to mediate to maintain their livelihoods and demanding that the company stop recruiting new workers to avoid a major dispute that could disrupt local security."</p>
<p>▲ Strike Committee Statement: According to Strike Committee member number 150, a statement was released to the Dagongshe reporter yesterday: "I am shocked to learn that some newspapers have referred to me as a 'running dog' and accused me of asking workers to stop beating White Russians and blocking buses. I have always represented the workers' interests since being elected as their representative. Moreover, six representatives went to negotiate with the company, and all negotiation details have been announced to the workers. There is no possibility of a third party undermining and dividing the workers' solidarity. In the future, we will continue to fight within legal boundaries and will not be discouraged by sabotage."</p>
<p>▲ Drivers Offer Support: After all ticket sellers declared a strike, they had considerable negotiations with the drivers beforehand. During yesterday's general meeting, the drivers also sent representatives to attend, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the company's oppression of workers. They resolved to stand with the workers and actively offer support. If the issue cannot be resolved within two or three days, all drivers will join in the support, potentially expanding the strike.</p>
<p>▲ Another Warning: The Strike Committee stated that Factory Director and Superintendent Short posted a notice at the company entrance on Kangnai Road yesterday, recruiting new workers. Over 100 people have already applied. The Strike Committee believes that this strike was caused by the company's unwarranted oppression and unbearable suffering. The recruitment of new workers while the strike remains unresolved will affect the strike's prospects. They issued another warning to the new workers yesterday, advising them not to take the job; otherwise, they would be considered to have violated strike discipline and would be dealt with forcefully. As a result, striking workers forcibly removed the uniforms of over a dozen new ticket sellers on Kangnai Road yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Throwing Excrement: The Xin Sheng She reported that the company continued to attempt to run buses on routes 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 yesterday to facilitate transportation. Passengers were few, fearing being caught in the crossfire of the striking workers. At 12 PM, as a route 9 bus traveled near the Great World amusement park, striking workers scooped out watermelons, filled them with excrement, and threw them into the bus. The stench filled the air, and the passengers were forced to endure the foul odor. A similar incident occurred at Jing'an Temple at 12 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Catastrophic Disaster in Wugong, Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>This year, Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, suffered black frost in March, accompanied by howling winds and hail. Although there was a single rainfall afterward, the young crops had withered, and drought conditions had formed. People were tearing down houses for firewood and fleeing from famine with their families, enduring extreme hardship and suffering that was unbearable to witness. Furthermore, since the start of summer, the epidemic has worsened daily, resulting in countless deaths. Desolate cries fill the land, awaiting burial in ditches and gullies. The tragic disaster situation has been reported in newspapers. Now, as autumn arrives without rain, the drought and pestilence worsen daily, leaving the people with no escape from death. The Shanghai Chinese Relief Society has received numerous reports from the Shaanxi Relief Society branch and gentry of Wugong County, requesting relief assistance. The society, unable to save due to a lack of funds but unwilling to ignore the situation, reluctantly raised 8,500 yuan for urgent relief and 1,500 yuan from the Xinwei Relief Society, totaling 10,000 yuan. They publicly appointed Mr. Wang Jishi, a gentry member of Wugong County and director of the Wugong Orphanage Training Center, as the director. They also sent a letter to Mr. Lu Hefu, chairman of the Chang'an Relief Society branch in Shaanxi, asking him to select members to assist. Relief efforts have already begun. The society has sent letters requesting detailed reports on the relief efforts and the situation of the disaster victims. Furthermore, due to the current widespread epidemic and the scarcity of effective medicines, the society has distributed 3,600 bottles of Jisheng Dan (relief pills) to the Shaanxi Relief Society, 3,000 bottles of Jisheng Dan to Mr. Wang Jishi in Wugong, and 16,900 bottles of Jisheng Dan in five shipments to Mr. Lu Hefu of the Chang'an branch in Shaanxi. They have also sent 500 bottles of Feilong Duoming Dan (Flying Dragon Life-Saving Pills) and 500 bottles of Lingbao Miaoying Dan (Lingbao Miraculous Response Pills) in succession to provide relief and protect the lives of the people, hoping to avert the disaster.</p>

<h3>Record of the Anhui Provincial Association Meeting</h3>
<p>▲ Thorough Investigation of Corruption in Anhui Northern Relief Efforts</p>
<p>▲ Opposing the Provincial Committee's Private Issuance of Provincial Bonds</p>
<p>The Anhui Association in Shanghai held a standing committee meeting yesterday. Attendees included standing committee members and the Anhui Northern Relief Investigation Team, National Government Relief Committee inspectors Wang Chusheng and Sun Yunseng (represented by Wang), representatives from the Beijing-Shanghai Anhui Association Shi Yinsheng, Wang Zhaoquan, Yue Xiangru, and Lü Yinnan, and over 30 members of the relief investigation committee. Guan Yunong was publicly elected chairman. First, Lü Yinnan of the investigation team reported on the investigation into corruption in the Anhui Northern Relief Efforts, stating that with the assistance of the two specialists from the National Government Relief Committee, Sun and Wang, and various sectors of the local community, sufficient evidence of corruption was obtained. The investigation revealed that commissioner Quan Shaowu and transport director Yang Shucheng had violated regulations, neglected their duties, colluded with unscrupulous merchants, and engaged in embezzlement, causing harm to the people's lives. This had led to opposition from the people in 21 counties, who fully exposed the corruption. Director Chen of the Anhui Northern Affairs Office was also held responsible for delaying the handling of affairs. The biggest problem was the undervaluation of relief grain for making noodles. The weight shortages were clear and well-documented. The meeting should pay attention and proceed according to the previously agreed upon nine measures to achieve the goal of punishing the guilty and pleading for the people's lives. Next, National Government inspector Wang Chusheng reported that the working group had paid close attention since the case occurred and that the truth of the matter was greatly clarified through the joint investigation by this association. Quan Shaowu's absurd handling of affairs was particularly unfortunate for northern Anhui. He will do his best to help the disaster victims and requests that the association submit a request for punishment based on the facts. Next, the chairman gave a speech thanking the National Government specialists for their enthusiasm in conducting the investigation and expressing hope that the National Government would seriously punish the guilty. Next, Wang Zhaoquan, the representative of the Beijing Anhui Association, proposed that since the Anhui Finance Department Director Ye Yuanlong came to Shanghai to borrow money from the banking industry, adding to the burden on the people, the Beijing association had telegraphed its opposition and specifically requested the Shanghai association's opinion. The chairman said that Anhui Province has suffered from natural and man-made disasters, and the people are in dire straits. Fortunately, previous provincial governments had no foreign debts. Even Ma Lianjia's 5 million yuan in debt was disavowed by the previous provincial government resolution. This loan was not publicly proposed, and its purpose is unclear. We should have an opinion. After discussion, a telegram was sent to express opposition. In addition, the Anhui Academic Society exposed that former construction directors Chen Jingshu and Li Fanyi had embezzled millions of yuan in construction funds. They were asked to unanimously support this exposure, and it was resolved to investigate and express their opinion. Next, Wang Zhuru reported on the process of participating in the various provincial associations' rescue of the patriotic youth Yun Huifang. Finally, several routine cases were discussed, and it was decided to raise funds for epidemic medicines to be transported to the affected counties to save the people.</p>

<h3>The Death of Female Workers After a Japanese Ship Capsized Their Boat - Family Members Appeal</h3>
<p>▲ Petitioning the Municipal Government to Negotiate Compensation with the Japanese Side</p>
<p>On the afternoon of August 9th, around 6 PM, a boat carrying 14 female workers from Qichang Pier in Pudong capsized while crossing the Huangpu River to work at factories in Puxi. The boat was suddenly hit by the Japanese ship Hakone Maru, which was turning around. The waves capsized the boat, causing all the female workers to fall into the river. With the exception of Qu Huoying, who was rescued, the remaining 13 drowned. Their bodies were subsequently recovered, identified by their families, and prepared for burial. According to previous reports, there were 13 deaths in total (previous reports of 11 were incorrect). The families of the deceased, Wu Yang, mother of Wu Pindi, Lu Zhenxiu, sister of Lu Xiangdi, Chen Kang, mother of Chen Jinxiu, Li Wang, mother of Li Amu, Gong Jinguai, father of Gong Xiaomei, Gong Zhulin, father of Gong Linbao, Huang Xushi, aunt of Huang Meiqian, Yang Fanshi, mother of Yang Jincui, Shi Xushi, sister-in-law of Shi Yangxiaoyuan, Lu Xiaoshi, aunt of Lu Gu Jinbao, Huang Lishi, sister of Huang Xiaoling, Ni Zhangshi, mother of Ni Lingdi, and Yuan Shanlai, father of Yuan Awen, totaling 13 families, stated that according to shipping regulations, there must be two officers stationed on the deck of a ship. The Hakone Maru's officers saw the boat behind the ship being hit by the waves, but they did not order the driver to stop the engine, causing the tragedy. The blame is undeniable. Furthermore, the families are poor, and they no longer have the income from the workers' wages. Now, with the loss of their loved ones, they are in deep grief. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Government, stating the reasons and requesting that the government negotiate with the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, demanding that the Toyo Company, owner of the Hakone Maru, provide compensation to value human life. At the same time, they appealed to philanthropists to provide relief to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Trial of Fan Hongsheng for the Murder of Wang Wenying</h3>
<p>▲ Sentencing on the 24th</p>
<p>Fan Hongsheng (aka Fan Ruikun) from Nanjing is under serious suspicion for the murder of female physiognomist Wang Wenying. He was detained by the police and brought before the First Special Court. Fan's lawyer, Jiang Baoyi, presented various pieces of evidence to prove that Fan had a mental illness. The details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court held a continuation of the trial. First, he questioned Wang Wenying's maid, Chen Ajin, briefly. Then he questioned Fan Hongsheng, who suddenly completely overturned his confessions in the police station and his testimony at the first trial, denying that he had killed Wang Wenying. He claimed that his initial confessions were not voluntary. The court then summoned the Chinese detective in charge of the case, Su Changsheng, to ask if Fan's confessions in the police station were voluntary. Su replied that they were entirely voluntary and that there was no coercion. Judge Feng then ordered the start of the closing arguments. First, the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that based on the testimony of the deceased's mother, Wang Wushi, and others, it could be inferred that the reason for Fan's murder was that he had been rejected in his attempt to propose marriage to Wang Wenying. The defendant presented witnesses and physical evidence to demonstrate the defendant's various states of mental illness, such as sitting on top of a car, using flies as food, and dancing with Indian police officers on the road. However, these are not sufficient to prove that he was also mentally incompetent at the time of the crime. The defendant bought cigarettes from the maid Chen Ajin with two pieces of lead money to avoid suspicion, fled the scene after the fact, and discarded the bloody clothes used in the murder. These are all sufficient to prove that the defendant was unusually clear-headed and no different from ordinary people at the time of the crime. Therefore, he should be sentenced to death according to law. However, because the defendant had a mental breakdown when he divorced his wife, Yang Xiuying, his mental capacity may be weaker than that of ordinary people. Therefore, he requested a slight reduction in the sentence to life imprisonment. The defendant's lawyer, Jiang Baoyi, replied that the diagnosis of mental illness is very difficult. Because the disease sometimes appears to be no different from ordinary people, even doctors cannot make a judgment and it must be assessed by an expert. In the past, someone was diagnosed with a mental illness only after more than a year of assessment by an expert. This shows how difficult diagnosis is. It is wrong to arbitrarily conclude that he does not have the disease simply because the defendant was not found to be mentally incompetent before and after his arrest. He also cited the writings of British and American mental health experts as evidence and asked the court to declare the defendant not guilty in accordance with Article 31 of the Criminal Law, which stipulates that acts committed by those who are mentally incapacitated are not punishable. The plaintiff Wang Wushi's lawyer, Dong Qin, filed an attached civil suit, demanding compensation of 12,000 yuan, calculated at 400 yuan per year for 30 years. However, Wang Wushi herself stated that she only wanted Fan Hongsheng to pay with his life and that Cheng Meixian should pay the 12,000 yuan. Judge Feng then declared the closing arguments concluded and scheduled sentencing for the 24th.</p>
<h3>Ye Lishao Accuses Xu Jiping of Abducting Their Child</h3>
<p>▲Xu Claims Illness and Fails to Appear</p>
<p>▲Jurisdiction Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Hu Bingheng, the manager of Jin Cheng Qian Zhuang, had an affair with Xu Jiping (also known as Xu Zhongyi), a female student from Chih Tze University, and they rented a house to live together, seemingly as husband and wife. However, the woman had long been betrothed by her parents to Ye Lishao of Fengjing as his wife. Ye was initially unaware of Xu's activities in Shanghai, so he still married her according to custom. Xu then found herself in a situation where she was involved with two men simultaneously, which lasted for five or six years. Until last year, Xu finally requested a divorce from Ye, inviting Ye to Shanghai. They drew up a divorce agreement at the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road, stipulating that their son, Duansheng, would remain Ye's child but would be raised by Xu until he turned sixteen, at which point he would be returned to Ye. The necessary education and upbringing expenses would be paid by Ye. Both parties signed the agreement and hired lawyer Yang Changchi to witness it, ensuring its validity. From then on, Xu believed that she could live happily ever after with Hu Bingheng. However, she later felt that Hu was not genuinely in love with her and became deeply suspicious of his previous claim that his first wife had passed away, wondering if it was not true. Therefore, she demanded a written guarantee to put her mind at ease. Hu then wrote a document stating that if he were found to still have a wife, he would pay her 100,000 yuan as compensation. Unexpectedly, before the ink was even dry, Xu discovered that Hu had a legal wife. She negotiated with him, but without satisfactory results. Consequently, she initially filed a criminal complaint against Hu for abandonment with the First Special District Court and then a civil lawsuit against Hu for breach of contract, demanding a judgment ordering him to pay the 100,000 yuan compensation and confirming her marital status with Hu. When the civil court opened the trial, Hu invited Xu's ex-husband, Ye Lishao, to testify. Ye then accused Xu of abducting his son, Duansheng, intending to use the child to extort money from others. Yesterday afternoon, the trial for Ye's case against Xu was scheduled to begin. At 2:30 PM, Judge Fu Lin ascended to the fifth courtroom. However, the defendant, Xu Jiping, claimed illness and did not appear. According to her lawyer, there was a jurisdictional issue in this case that should be investigated first. Since Xu resided in the French Concession and cohabitated with Hu in Yuanchang Lane on Julong Road, and then moved to No. 88 Huayuan Lane when the lawsuit with Hu began, none of these locations fell under the jurisdiction of the court. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that the financial fraud element of the plaintiff's accusation was based on the divorce agreement, which was negotiated at the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Xizang Road and signed at the law office of Yang Changchi. Therefore, the location of the crime fell within the court's jurisdiction and should be accepted by the court. Judge Fu felt that this point required further investigation and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Prison Guard in Women's Prison Illegally Delivers Opium to Inmate</h3>
<p>A woman named Du Wenshi was recently arrested and sentenced for opium use and imprisoned in the women's prison of the First Special District Court. At 5:30 AM on the 13th of this month, a person named Ye paid 10 yuan to bribe Mai Wen, a Cantonese prison guard at the women's prison gate, to deliver a small packet of opium to the female guard leader, Guo Huijun, instructing her to pass it on to the female inmate, Du Wenshi. Guo immediately reported the incident, along with the opium, to the warden, Huang Yaohua, who detained Mai. The prosecutor, Zhong Qingzhi, concluded the preliminary investigation on the previous day, confirming that Mai had committed a criminal act. The prosecutor then notified the Shanghai Municipal Council's Legal Department to prosecute him according to the law. Mai was handed over to the police of the Municipal Council for detention and was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday morning. According to the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, the defendant was being prosecuted under Article 29, Section 12 of the Criminal Law for dereliction of duty and Article 13 of the Anti-Opium Law. Subsequently, the female guard Guo Huijun testified that the defendant had handed her a small paper packet that morning, asking her to pass it on to the female inmate Du Wenshi, saying that it contained opium and promising to reward her with five yuan. She refused and warned him not to violate the law, urging him to leave immediately. However, the defendant persisted, so she reported the incident, along with the packet, to the warden. The warden opened the packet and found four white pills and two opium pellets. He then summoned Mai for questioning and reported the matter to the prosecutor's office for investigation. When questioned, the defendant claimed that Guo had asked him to buy aspirin for a headache on the 12th for one yuan, which he then delivered to her the next morning at a paper shop next to the court. He denied delivering opium. He said that there was another reason for the accusation. After the former warden, Madam Fang, was dismissed, Guo and others suspected that he and others had spoken against her, so they were now framing him and requested an investigation. Judge Ge ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days later to investigate the matter further.</p>
<h3>Wu Jianguang's Son's Scandal Resolved</h3>
<p>Wu Zhongliang, the son of Wu Jianguang, had previously engaged in a physical relationship with Shen Ai'e, a female employee of the ABC Commercial Press on Jiujiang Road. However, he recently abandoned her, prompting Shen's mother, Shen Chushi, to hire lawyer Xue Jiaqi to sue Wu for enticement in the First Special Court. Wu Zhongliang also hired Zheng Wenkai as his lawyer to defend him and file a counterclaim. All details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. The lawyers of both parties have now mediated a settlement, and the settlement has been established. Therefore, when the trial opened yesterday afternoon, both lawyers requested that their lawsuits be withdrawn, which Judge Wu approved. He then ruled that the case would not be heard. The settlement agreement is transcribed below: Settlement Agreement Attached to Civil Lawsuit: Shen Chushi and Wu Zhongliang, after mediation by both parties' lawyers, both parties are willing to settle the dispute. Wu Zhongliang will pay Shen Chushi 600 yuan, and the mediator will add 100 yuan, totaling 700 yuan, to be paid in full on the date of signing. Shen Chushi is willing to immediately withdraw the private prosecution, and Wu Zhongliang will also immediately withdraw the counterclaim. Neither party will pursue any further disputes.</p>
<h3>Gengxin Theater Destroyed</h3>
<p>▲Entire Building Consumed by Fire</p>
<p>▲Estimated Loss of Approximately 30,000 to 40,000</p>
<p>The Lin Ji Gengxin Theater at the intersection of Menggu Road in Zhabei ceased operations after the Shanghai Incident. After the Shanghai Armistice Agreement was reached and the Japanese troops withdrew, it was taken over by Gu and others. Starting in early June, they extensively renovated the interior, repainted everything, and added more than 500 new chairs. The renovation had been completed and they planned to reopen before the traditional Mid-Autumn Festival. Yesterday morning at 3:35 AM, the theater's watchmen, Wang Yongshan (age 57, from Hebei), Guo Yuqing (age 32, from Tianjin), and Li Yuanlin, were sleeping downstairs near the staircase because of the heat. Zhang, a tutor from one of the shareholders' families, along with a Mr. Chen and a tailor Mr. Jia, were sleeping upstairs in the accounting room. Unexpectedly, just as they were sound asleep, a crackling sound was heard from the west side of the ticket office downstairs. Watchman Guo Yuqing immediately woke up and saw smoke billowing and flames spreading rapidly. He shouted loudly, and the sleepers jumped up to get water to extinguish the fire. However, the walls were freshly painted and easily flammable, so the fire spread rapidly and became uncontrollable. The fire brigades from the nearby sections arrived in their fire trucks and bravely fought the fire until about 7 AM, when it was finally extinguished. The interior tables, chairs, and stage were completely destroyed. It was reported that some of the scenery and costumes were also reduced to ashes. The theater had been hastily prepared and was not insured, so the estimated loss was between 30,000 and 40,000 yuan. It was also reported that when the fire was raging, Zhang and Chen, who were sleeping upstairs, were eager to escape and jumped out of the window, sustaining serious injuries from the fall. The cause of the fire is still unclear. The police from the First Branch of the Fourth District detained the watchmen Wang Yongshan and Guo Yuqing for questioning.</p>
<h3>Huadong Factory Donates Festival Funds to Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers</h3>
<p>Chen Youyun and Qiu Xinyi, the managers of the Huadong Woolen and Camel Hair Factory, and all of its employees, felt moved by the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers' efforts to resist the invaders and protect the country. They specially donated 30 yuan from the factory's Mid-Autumn Festival feast to the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers. This practice of donating festival funds to support the troops should be emulated by all businesses in Shanghai to save the Northeast from its plight.</p>
<h3>Shihua Bookstore Pioneering Sales to Support Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers</h3>
<p>▲Purchase a Copy of "The Biography of General Ma Zhanshan"</p>
<p>▲Long-Term Donation of 10 Cents to the Volunteer Army from Each Sale</p>
<p>At a time when the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers are engaged in a bloody battle with the enemy and urgently need funds, while various sectors have made many donations, those who can provide long-term support are still rare. It was recently learned that Shihua Bookstore on Danfeng Road, inside Xiaodongmen, recognizing this need, has specially decided to donate 10 cents to the Volunteer Army from the sale price of each newly published copy of "The Biography of General Ma Zhanshan," setting a precedent for all industries. The bookstore also plans to publish the names of the book buyers to promote this righteous cause. It is reported that the book was written by Mr. Zhang Nannong and begins with the General's family history, starting with his grandfather and great-grandfather. It then describes the chivalrous marriage of his parents in their youth, the deeds of the General in his youth and adulthood, various anecdotes about his wife and mother, and the behind-the-scenes details of his recent daring capture of the enemy in their den to resist the Japanese and oppose the traitors. These details are generally unknown to the outside world and are not comparable to novels that are simply compiled from newspaper clippings and fabricated stories. The General's representative, Mr. Han Liru, has personally signed the book, confirming that the recorded events are true. The book also includes prefaces from prominent figures from all sectors of society, amounting to over a hundred, all reproduced as zinc plates and printed on high-quality paper, making it valuable. The entire book consists of two thick volumes and sells for only 1.20 yuan, with a long-term donation of 10 cents to the Volunteer Army, making it easy and accessible for people to contribute and accumulate small amounts into a significant sum. The actions of the bookstore are truly commendable.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong Travel Agency Declaration</h3>
<p>The Jiaotong Travel Agency was initiated and established by prominent figures in Shanghai, including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Binyan, Gao Guanwu, Feng Zhihe, Li Guangzhen, and Ke Juchu. The preparatory office is located at No. 35 Renji Road on Sichuan Road. Yesterday, the initiators of the agency issued a declaration to all sectors, the original text of which is as follows: "Declaration" Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, "Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four major needs of human life." As for transportation, although our country has many trains and waterways, making travel convenient, the protection of merchants and travelers lacks adequate mechanisms. In major commercial ports across the country, upon the arrival of trains and ships, one can see porters swarming and rushing, bumping and jostling, surrounding and obstructing, clamoring and extorting, which is far from orderly and resembles banditry. This situation directly reflects the weaknesses of the country and society, increasing the lament of travelers and merchants, who often lose items and have their goods stolen. This chaotic state is enough to show the weakness of the nation and the chaos of society, increasing the sighs of merchants and travellers, and everyone who has been on a journey has experienced this. Therefore, to ensure the safety of travelers, planning and construction are essential. One can observe the tranquility of train arrivals and the orderliness of traffic in Western countries, where civilization and transportation are increasingly convenient. Although there are those in our country who care about social construction and know that travel agencies are indispensable in modern times, even if established, their convenience cannot be extended to ordinary people. Recognizing this, we embrace high aspirations to seek national glory, social order, travel safety, and human happiness. Through extensive research, we have gathered the resources and intelligence of many individuals to contribute to society. Therefore, we plan to organize the Jiaotong Travel Agency, providing affordable cargo transportation, proper reception and sending-off services, and striving to make convenience accessible to ordinary people, so that they can truly feel at home. The preparatory period has already lasted for two months. The standard capital is set at 100,000 yuan, operating as a limited liability company. However, our knowledge is limited, and our resources are insufficient. We hope that prominent figures in society will not hesitate to offer advice and guidance, so that the Jiaotong Travel Agency can be perfected and realized as soon as possible. This would be fortunate for us and fortunate for society. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Elderly Accountant Commits Suicide Due to Unemployment</h3>
<p>Sun Axiang (age 30), a Ningbo native who previously worked as a senior accountant at Kongshi Foreign Firm, had recently been unemployed and was residing at the dental clinic of Song Kangqi at No. 334, Six Malu, with his sister, Fu Sunshi, who provided him with food and clothing. Although Sun repeatedly asked people to help him find a job, he was consistently disappointed. As a result, he developed a pessimistic outlook on life and secretly ingested opium to commit suicide. After being discovered, he was sent to Renji Hospital. However, due to severe poisoning, he soon died. The hospital notified the Laozha Gate Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Zhan Liangce, the prosecutor delegated by the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to conduct the examination. He opened the case and heard the testimony of Song Kangqi, who stated that the deceased's sister had been renting a room from him for four or five years and that he had always seen the siblings getting along well. On the day in question, he found the deceased sleeping in bed, looking pale and foaming at the mouth, so he sent him to the hospital for treatment. Fu Sunshi, his sister, also provided a statement. After reviewing the testimonies, Prosecutor Zhan concluded that Sun Axiang had died from opium poisoning before death, and the body was handed over to his sister for funeral arrangements.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently read the local news section of your August 16th issue regarding the case of university professors suspected of being communists, which mentioned Chen Gaoyong, a logic instructor at Jinan University, being arrested due to communist suspicions. I was shocked. After checking, our school has no such person as Chen Gaoyong. It appears to be inaccurate information. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Jinan University, August 16th</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have read an article in yesterday's 本埠 News column "电力公司工潮解决" (电力公司 labor dispute resolved) and confirmed that the information does not correspond to the facts. The party and government agencies sent personnel to the company to negotiate only on the problem of the unemployed workers. The four requirements conditions discussed in the plenary meeting of the employees were not yet mentioned. Because of the firm attitude of the capitalist, all employees are generally angry. Our association shall also, according to the will of the workers, continue to fight to achieve the final victory; therefore, this labor unrest has not been declared resolved. It is feared that the social people, are not aware of the truth, which is easy to cause misunderstanding. I am therefore specially writing to ask you to give a correction. Sincerely, the editor of Shenbao, Shanghai Electric Power Company Labour Union, August 17</p>

<h3>Stringing Up a Flying Eagle</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>An eagle is a bird of prey!</p>
<p>The iron bird in the sky is even fiercer than your flying eagle! Not knowing to grieve for the rabbit when it dies, or to commiserate with its own kind! Yet it used its own iron bird to harm its own flying eagle! Pitiful eagle! Sinking, oh so sinking, sinking, oh so sinking, the flying eagle has turned into a hidden scale! Ate your eagle meat, returned your eagle bones, that can be considered a show of humanity! What is humanity? It is being prepared to string up flying eagles. I have just casually composed this limerick, and I also have to explain the matter of this poem... The Guangdong province, because of the naval incident, sunk the Republic of China's aircraft and bombarded the Republic of China's destroyer, which everyone thought was a pity! According to Guangdong's side, the authorities thought that the ship was of great value and had a strong fighting force and, after stringing it up, still intended to get it back for Guangdong's use. At the same time, the central government also intended to take over the ship to consolidate the strength of the sea defense. As a result of the negotiations between the two sides, the Guangdong side was extremely generous and allowed the sunk ship to belong to the central government, and all the costs of stringing it up would be borne by the central government, and the central government would send personnel to inspect and handle the stringing up matters, etc. Eaten your meat, returned your bones... these two common sayings have also become facts. But the flying eagle has been sunk for a long time, and in the future when it is strung up, can a pile of eagle bones not be corrupted? If, it turns out to be something tasteless to eat, and a chicken rib that is a pity to throw away, what will we do? Whether this soaked chicken-like eagle is useful or not, but it is a great show of humanity that the Guangdong authorities are willing to give it to the central government! Worthy for me to compose a song of praise and virtue.</p>
<h3>Recording Old Feelings While Playing the Zhu—Jielu</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>I read Ye Chucang's "Record of Playing the Zhu on the Border", and I could not help but float a large white and said: "How great, Tieyao. You are truly a patriotic strongman in the greenwood." Watching him bind the false medicine peddler Tian Xiaoji, take the leather bags, and go with A Ran to drink Jiangnan's wedding wine. He played with cunning thieves in his palm. And the stolen Dongshan secret map was returned to Tieyao's hand. How happy it is. But, how long has it been? The map has changed color, and what more to say about being stolen? Tieyao does not do it, where is A Ran? Is the novelist's words just for self-deprecation? As far as I have heard, if it is Old North Wind, Little White Dragon, or Wang Delin, are they not the likes of Tieyao and A Ran? A guest spoke of the Yellow Slave exterminating the enemy. Yellow Slave, a native of western Liaoning, was hired by a cunning robber, Mr. Jia's family, for more than ten years. He served diligently and got Mr. Jia's pleasure. After the September 18th incident, the slave served him more carefully. Jia treated him, because they had been together for a long time, and because he was ignorant and did not understand national affairs, he made gestures and commanded him all day long without complaining. He didn't suspect him. One day, the slave stole the master's gun, suddenly got up and shot his children, a total of six. Then he fled. Mr. Jia went out on business and was spared from the disaster. It reminds me of the rebellion of Wumeng in Yunnan in the early Qing Dynasty. Many civil and military officials were killed. The rebellious Guo were rampant. They rode official horses, wore the military uniforms of generals and marshals, and held military weapons. They acted without restraint. They released the drum and music players and the servants and did not kill them, ordering them to serve their purpose. A certain righteous servant, a gunner of military rank, was dead.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Famous People</h3>
<p>— · Old Man Rice-Field Bull ·</p>
<p>Liang Jie'an from Guangdong, Yi Shunding from Longyang, and Zheng Xiaoxu from Marquis' Palace were all students of Zhang Zhidong, posthumously known as the Cultural Exemplar of Nanpi, from the Baobing Hall. During the late years of the Guangxu era in the former Qing Dynasty, when Zhang, as the governor of Huguang, held great power and influence, Liang and the others were his close associates. They were once known as the "Three Dragons," with Liang as the dragon's head, Yi as the dragon's belly, and Zheng as the dragon's tail. Whenever the governor had some leisure time after official duties, he would retire from public affairs and engage in casual conversation with his disciples in his quiet study, amidst the smoke of tea. The old man of Baobing Hall enjoyed using "poetry clock" with seven rounds and drinking games and mountain songs as a way to pass the long days. For example, poetry clock games like: (Lin Daiyu and a knife) "The concubine buries flowers, with tears in both eyes; the husband achieves his goal, with a head falling to the ground." (Fan Li and a flute) "The misty waters of Five Lakes are priceless in spring; the passes and mountains without villages have the sound of the moon." (Pedicure and selling court gazettes) "The effort under the feet requires a three-inch iron; the current value is only one cash." (During the Guangxu era, there were peddlers who specialized in printing clay tablets with information about newly appointed provincial officials or promotions and demotions of Beijing officials, calling them "court gazettes," each selling for one cash. After the Xuantong era, such calls were no longer heard in the market.) (Chess and mosquitoes) "Black and white crisscross, knocking on the night moon; morning and dusk faintly stir, like spring thunder." (Cao Cao and crabs) "Heroes under heaven are only me; before wine, the taste has both sharp and round." (Eliminating Cold Pictures and spring grass) "The grain man writes a small preface to the pipe; Yunbo's new poem imitates the Six Dynasties." (Tea sound and Imperial Academy Student) "Famous garden flower events have ended in prosperity; talents from the Imperial Academy are numerous and outstanding." (Qu Yuan and the painted eyebrow bird) "Casting the book into the White Water, harboring thoughts of the Chu guest; crying at dawn in the green window, calling for Zhang Lang." (Lotus leaf coin and flower list) "The young master of the Xia family finds it hard to squander; the famous courtesan of the fragrant land enters the ranks for comments." etc. Elegant and humorous, both were combined. The art world spread the word, and the price of paper in Luoyang rose. In the past thirty years, the teacher and disciples have passed away one after another. Only Jiei Yuan, the old man, doesn't realize it and follows the puppets into Shenyang. He is ashamed of his ancestor, the hermit of Banqiao, who was so much more unrestrained.</p>
<p>Captured and forced to be a gunner by the Jurchens. When the Jurchen army suffered a defeat, he planned to use the cannon but didn't know how. The righteous soldier pointed the muzzle upward. The Jurchens also pointed at it. Angered, he said, "It must be pointed at them." The righteous soldier deceptively said, "If so, another cannon must be made." The Jurchens allowed it. The righteous soldier broke the fuse of the cannon in a secluded place. Seeing a barrel of gunpowder nearby, he rushed to the barrel with a torch. The Jurchens hurriedly tried to stop him, but it was too late. The fire ignited, and the barrel exploded, sounding like thunder. The rocks on the mountain collapsed. The Jurchens near the fire all died, and the effects extended ten miles away. The righteous soldier also perished in the flames. Chang Lutan of the early Qing Dynasty recorded this event in the Zuihong Pavilion Collection, praising his sacrifice as saving a million lives in southern Yunnan. The death of the righteous soldier was not a death at all. Alas! A certain chauffeur during the Shanghai War, who did not hesitate to sacrifice his life and perished with the enemy's artillery shells in the Huangpu River, can also be considered to share immortality with the righteous soldier of Wumeng.</p>
<h3>Americans and Alcohol</h3>
<p>— Gu Dai</p>
<p>In the eyes of Americans, alcohol is nothing less than a second life. Before the Prohibition Act was enacted, the number of taverns was truly indescribable. Fine wines were displayed everywhere in cafes, dance halls, and even restaurants and hotels. Even in remote villages with only a few families, there would be liquor stalls. American women enjoy traveling. During their leisure time after work, they often take their partners for a drive to the suburbs. When thirsty, they would often buy wine to quench their thirst. However, the strong alcohol content often led to confusion and caused accidents. In urban areas, signs saying "Five Cents a Drink" could be seen every ten steps in residential and industrial areas. These taverns were poorly equipped, with no tables or chairs. All they had was a long counter. Those who loved to drink could pay five cents to hold a cup and drink heartily while leaning against the counter. Paying ten cents allowed them to finish two cups. Common laborers mostly got drunk here.</p>
<p>The day with the highest volume of alcohol sales in taverns and all entertainment venues was Saturday noon until the early morning of the following day. This was because American workers and some government employees were paid on Saturday mornings. Many used their week's earnings to buy drinks. At five cents a cup, they would drink like cattle, vomiting when drunk and continuing to drink as before, until the evening mist descended, and the lights of thousands of homes shone, or even until the night was late and their purses were empty. Only then would they dance and sing, staggering home. Wives would cry from hunger, and children would wail from cold, but they would not care. Even more were those who were too drunk to walk and would lie down in the middle of the road. It was not uncommon to see severed limbs and broken feet under the wheels of passing cars. Therefore, during the last presidential election, women with the right to vote all supported Hoover, because Hoover was the strongest advocate for Prohibition.</p>
<p>However, after President Hoover issued the Prohibition Act, it was implemented vigorously. It seemed that it could be completely abolished in one fell swoop, satisfying the wishes of women with husbands addicted to alcohol. But in reality, it was not so. Open sales were indeed impossible, but private brewing, private trafficking, and private sales were still everywhere. Because the prohibition was strict, the operations were extremely secretive, making it very difficult to detect and crack down. Although a few who were once immersed in alcohol were deterred by the strictness of the law and dared not try easily, generally speaking, the situation was still as prevalent as before, only changing from open to secret. Therefore, the Prohibition policy in America can be said to be a complete failure. It is rumored that in the upcoming election this winter, if Hoover is not re-elected and the opposition party comes to power, the Prohibition Act will inevitably be repealed. This is because Prohibition has not only failed to achieve any results, but the country has also reduced its tax revenue from alcohol as a result.</p>
<p>▲ Er Yi Zhi Tan Errata: In the "Strength and Gentleness" section, first paragraph, "people with no progress," the character "no" was mistakenly printed as "institute." In the third paragraph, "only hear the sharp knife cutting tofu," the character "one" is missing after "falling." In the "Tongue" section, "ugly ugly woman," the character "ugly" was mistakenly printed as "appearance." In the "Cai E and the Five Rivers" section, the character "Xie" in "Xie Shanshan" was mistakenly printed as "Xie" throughout.</p>
<h3>Foreigners' Opinions on Chinese Aviation</h3>
<p>— Listening·Zen·</p>
<p>The following is a translation from issue 91 of the Japanese magazine "Aviation Affairs," originally published in the British magazine "Aircraft," being a letter to the "Central, China Postal Service" magazine from a Far East correspondent stationed by our company (referring to the Aircraft magazine company itself). It is now transcribed below.</p>
<p>"Wake up, China! Please wake up!</p>
<p>No matter what the matter, whenever it is put into the hands of the Chinese to implement, it shows that you are the most incompetent country in the world." Recently, during my second visit to the Hankou airfield, I couldn't help but utter the above words in disappointment. The postal aviation service has been in operation for two years. Initially, the airfield was supposed to have considerable improvements, but instead, not only has this not happened, but the Chinese government is constantly undermining itself. How can this be? The postal airplanes still take off and land in a corner of the airfield that is both filthy and chaotic. The hangars (referring to the storage houses for airplanes) are still crammed with military airplanes in a mess. What's worse, outside the hangars, there are many broken, damaged, and dilapidated airplanes piled up like "a mountain," with no one bothering to take care of them. This situation would startle even the most heartless traveler, leaving them speechless.</p>
<p>In a barracks as filthy as a pigsty, a squad of soldiers in beggar-like clothing squats there, doing nothing all day.</p>
<p>On a road half-submerged in puddles, there are two sentry tents lying in disarray, which is especially infuriating. What's more, sentries are actually posted there, but without any rules or regulations. If travelers want to pass through this area to reach the airplane parking area, they can't pass through casually. If you try to explain this to them, they won't understand at all, which is very frustrating. It seems that the officers have never taught the sentries what their duties are. So what is the purpose of setting up these sentries? It's really inexplicable.</p>
<p>Besides this vast open space, there are no toilets provided for the military or travelers. As a result, after a long time, urine and feces can be found everywhere.</p>
<p>For weighing postal letters or luggage, there is indeed a scale-like object placed there for weighing purposes, but its appearance makes one suspect that it is "difficult to be accurate." Because of the management methods described above, it is no wonder that the airfield has repeatedly become like a muddy sea. Now, it has simply become a lake surface. I personally saw an airplane, during takeoff, carrying mud and water as high as fifteen feet, covering the passengers, seats, and luggage with rotten mud, turning them all into mud people. During takeoff, they always try to leave the ground four or five times. Each time they take off, they drag mud and water. This time, it seems to be able to take off, but it stops again and has to start over again. Do you think the passengers can bear it?</p>
<p>Wake up, China! If you really want to revitalize the aviation industry, then this cannot continue. It is hoped that you will build a proper airfield and use the common sense that can maintain this industry. Try to open your eyes and see how the airplanes and passengers are being messed with in that area! See if your useless soldiers are hindering your industry! Prove whether my words are unfair. As for the soldiers, I will now say a little opinion in passing, although it is not within the scope of this topic, rather than wasting the country's useful money to raise these soldiers who stand on one leg like old chickens and suffer from "rheumatism" (a disease that can hinder the "operation of aircraft," that is, paralysis, the original text is very descriptive of their deformity), it is better to use it for the drainage project in the flooded barracks. Canadians are good at speaking frankly, please forgive me!</p>
<p>According to this article, which is a Japanese magazine translating a British magazine, the description is extremely sarcastic. Reading it makes one feel ashamed and greatly reduces one's desire to study aviation. In order to make the public universally understand what foreigners think of our aviation, I have spared no effort in my busy work to translate this from the Japanese magazine to provide everyone with a cold sweat. However, the Japanese translator originally noted that "the authenticity of the facts is unclear, and it may not be so severe." In my humble opinion, perhaps the correspondent visited after the great flood in Hankou, so it is no wonder that there is such a phenomenon. Listening Zen again.</p>

<h3>Gold Exchange Rate Falls, Gold Price Rises</h3>
<p>▲ Market Fluctuations Occurred Yesterday's gold exchange rate fell and then rose again, but without any special changes. There was a slight upward trend, with intermittent fluctuations totaling about four taels in price difference. Dealers' sentiment remained uncertain, with frequent entries and exits. Ultimately, the price rose by more than four taels, reaching a high. Although the silver market rose, the forward silver price fell instead, leading to a higher opening. As the foreign exchange market appeared stable, with hidden strength, gold dealers sold British gold slightly, while American dollars continued to be shorted to counter the price. The market had more buyers, pushing prices down, with occasional fluctuations of more than two taels. Later, due to short covering, prices rebounded. In the afternoon, as it was Wednesday, there were frequent holidays. The September-October swap that had not been completed was done by Hengxing, posting a difference of five qian, while other firms still had more than four thousand taels unswapped. It is said that the new trading volume for the October term was about twenty-one thousand taels. The details of the morning market are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Rebound of Four Taels and Four Qian The September term opened, rising four taels and six qian, to 713 taels and eight qian. Large orders for the near term remained as before, with the far term increasing by one-eighth. Silver prices also rose by one-quarter, but this had no effect. Private cables did not change. The exchange rate of British pounds fell while the American dollar rose, so the market sentiment was upward. Then, it decreased by three qian, with buyers from all sides exceeding usual. Hengyu, Fuyu, Yuhe, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, and others all competed to buy. Also, the exchange market seemed better, with China Bank absorbing British gold for December at 195625, and doing American dollars for September at thirty-one yuan. Therefore, the gold price increased by more than one tael in a frenzy, to fifteen taels and two qian. Shortly after, Yuanxing, Yongyifeng, Yongyong, Yuanheng, Yuanmao, Yongyi, and others all divested. And because the American dollar eased, Mitsui came out with October at 125, and Anda and American Express did December at half a yuan, so it fell again by more than three taels, with only a small profit of one tael, reaching eleven taels and eight qian at 9:20 AM. Suddenly, it increased by two taels, to thirteen taels and seven or eight qian, because Qianchang, Xiangfutai, Hengyuantai, Yuhe, and others entered the market. The opening price of British gold did not change, and the American dollar hung large at 125, but it had no impact. The domestic market was still flat, slightly lower by four or five qian. In an instant, it soared again, with Hengchang, Yongyifeng, Yongyong, Bingxing, Hengxing entering the market to buy, so it became fifteen taels and one qian. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of more than two taels, but sellers were active. After 10 AM, HSBC came out with British gold for September at 375, Zhengjin came out with November at 5625, and Hengchang, Yongheng, Yuzhifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Hengxingyuan, and others all sold vigorously, while Hengxing bought, as the price had fallen to around thirteen taels. After 10:30 AM, it became more and more tired, with Huabi coming out with thirty-one yuan for this month, 375 for November, and Fuyu, Yongfeng, Hongkangyong, Xiexingyong, and others following suit to sell, continuing to decline by two or three taels. At 11 AM, it suddenly became ten taels and five qian, but Daxingyong, Hengyu, Zhifengyong dragged it in, and Huabi and Makari absorbed British gold for October at 19 and a half, plus more than one tael, totaling twelve taels and three qian. At that time, there was another small profit of one qian. After 11:30 AM, it rebounded again, as Makari absorbed British gold for November at 5625. The buying momentum on the table suddenly increased, with Yuankangxiang, Daxingyong, Yuanyong, Dayongyuhe, and others making efforts to enter. Also, some small short sellers did not want to carry over to the next day, so they followed to buy, turning from weakness to strength in an instant, jumping more than three taels, with the profit being only a few qian, reaching fourteen taels and six qian at 11:50 AM. However, many small long-term holders took this opportunity to sell, and Zhifengyong, Hengyu, Yifengyong also sold slightly, causing the price to fall again. At the noon closing, it was thirteen taels and six qian, continuing to trade within thirteen taels, a rebound of four taels and four qian compared to the previous day (according to the listed price). According to the confusing market conditions, it is difficult to grasp the situation. In short, people's hearts are not settled, and they are losing their measures. The maximum price for half a day was fifteen taels and two qian, the minimum price was ten taels and a half, with a difference of four taels and seven qian. The net taels totaled nine taels.</p>
<p>▲ Discount Reduced by Seven Taels The discount was changed to 787 taels, because the American dollar was hung high at 125, estimating the reduction to be 73 to 77 taels. The noon closing was 74 to 75 taels, a reduction of seven taels compared to the previous day. The amounts recorded for each month were all 14 taels, and the water supplement was 13 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Complex Trading Among Various Firms Trading on the table was still active, but the situation was complex. According to statistics, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Hengxing, Bingxing, Yuankangxiang, Yuhe, Yuantai, Kaitai, Hengchangyong, Futaiheng all entered. Yuanxingyong, Yuanheng, Xiexingyong, Taifengcheng, Yongfeng, Hengxingyuan all exited. Yuanmaoyong, Yuandayong, Hengyu, Shunli, Fuyu, Wanxing, Zhaofengchang, Daxingyong, Hongkangyong, etc., had quite a lot of back-and-forth trading. The Ningbo firms collectively entered more than four hundred taels and sold more than three hundred taels. The Guangdong firms, such as Hengxing, bought five or six hundred taels, but the number of sellers was less.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Becomes More Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market rose slightly, and the exchange rate of British pounds fell while the American dollar rose. The Shanghai market seemed to stabilize. HSBC's listed price only increased the American dollar by 125, to thirty and a half yuan, and Deutsche Bank added 25. There were no other changes. As for the internal situation, it seemed stable, initially strong, then loose, and returning to flat at noon. As a result, compared to the day before, both the British pound and the American dollar decreased by 0.0625, which is said to be wide and bright, but secretly firm, causing the gold price to rebound by more than four taels, and another 710 taels were returned. The trading volume of various banks was not as active as the day before, with about 100,000 pounds of British gold being traded. The gold dealers slightly exited, and Sassoon Bank bought back in. The American dollar transaction was only about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, with Chinese merchants continuing to close short positions and sell gold, but the closing price was reduced by seven taels compared to the day before, totaling 74 to 75 taels. American banks absorbed slightly. The market closed early because it was Wednesday, as usual.</p>
<p>▲ Internal British Exchange Rate The internal price fluctuated slightly in half a day, with only a review of 0.0625.

The purchase price for each month increased by 125.</p>

The closing selling price at noon was 30.9375 yuan for August, 1 yuan for September, 1.1875 yuan for October, 375 for November, and half a yuan for December.

<h3>Quiet and Constant Call Loan Market</h3>
<p>▲ Dull and Boring Market Conditions Yesterday's market conditions, various situations and trends were mostly stable, without much change. In all transactions, except for some activity in stomach-settling, the other external and internal aspects were generally relaxed and tired, as usual. However, the current market sentiment for silver and foreign currency is usually scattered and idle, and it is difficult to have prosperity. Even the exchange news from banks is currently quite deep, indicating that the trend of foreign trade is also in a calm state.</p>

The noon market was another 1 hao and 2 hu and a half better, at 6 qian, 8 fen, 6 li, 8 hao and 7 hu and a half. The result was only 2 hao and a half better, and the market atmosphere was very quiet with minimal transactions. The "silver call loan" rates in both the early and noon markets were 7 fen, slightly smaller by 1 fen compared to the noon market of the previous day. The drawing fee plus water was 5 to 6 fen, the silver market conditions were loose as usual, and the usage was quite calm, likely due to the sluggishness of commercial goods.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary Currencies Mostly Low The Jiangnan small foreign currency in the early and noon markets was the same at 6 qian, 0 fen, 0 li, and 7 hao and a half, which was slightly better by half a li compared to the noon market of the previous day, but the same as the morning market. The transaction volume was 7,000 jiao in the early market and 2,000 jiao in the noon market. The Guangdong small foreign currency was 5 qian, 8 fen and 1 li in the early market and 5 qian, 8 fen and 0 li and 7 hao and a half in the noon market. As a result, it was another half a li smaller compared to the early market of the previous day. The transaction volume was 95,000 jiao in the early market and 50,000 jiao in the noon market. Copper coins were extended by 500 wen, to 432,000 wen. The transaction volume was 45,792 strings, totaling 10,600 taels of silver.</p>

The off-exchange banknote market was 105,000 in the early market and 55,000 in the noon market. The on-exchange banknote market was 35,000 in the early market and 60,000 in the noon market.

<h3>Securities and Bonds Traded All Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Trading Volume of 4.4 Million, Prices Rebounded Slightly The Chinese Securities Exchange has resumed full-day trading. The futures market conditions were more prosperous than before. The market sentiment was still active, with 2,300,000 in the morning market and 2,100,000 in the afternoon market, totaling 4,430,000 yuan. Although many spot goods were opened, the inflow and outflow were still scarce. Only a few thousand yuan of various bonds were traded, totaling only 18,000 yuan. As for the bond situation, the political situation suddenly improved, and even the North did not have any other changes. Therefore, the environment was optimistic, people's hearts were stable, and the market was not deserted with sporadic collections. The price rebounded compared to before, but the ups and downs were still flat. Compared to the previous day, only the disarmament futures rose by 8 to 9 jiao, and the rest only improved by about 3 to 4 jiao. Only a few spot goods with recent trading had significant changes.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>(Report from the American Eastern Bank Corporation)</p>
<p>▲ Opening Momentum Unmatched ▲ Struck by Plunging Wheat Prices</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the New York stock market continued the upward trend from Monday. The opening saw immediate strength, and trading was extremely active. Within the first hour, 800,000 shares changed hands, a rare occurrence. Based on the prevailing conditions, the market was expected to develop even further. However, soon after, wheat prices were reported to have plummeted drastically. Although this event caused some concern, the overall sentiment remained strong. Therefore, the market was not greatly affected. Taking U.S. Steel shares as an example, the previous week's closing price was $40.125. On Tuesday's opening, it immediately jumped to $45, closing at $43.125. Railroad stocks were relatively stable, with Union Pacific Railroad, a representative stock, rising by $4.50 from the previous day. Utility stocks performed best with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which also rose by $4.50 from the previous day. Judging from the current stock market situation, it appears that wheat prices will be the determining factor. If wheat prices continue to fall, the stock market will be severely affected. Conversely, if wheat prices can quickly rebound, the stock market will continue to rise. Attached below are the Dow Jones indices for Tuesday:</p>
<p>August 15th  August 16th  Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>Thirty Industrials     66.51       68.91       Up 2.40</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market is virtually lifeless. The cotton yarn market sentiment has turned weak, while overseas cotton markets remain stable. Domestic actual demand has stagnated. Various native banks in the southern ports purchased a significant amount of yarn before January, but the existing yarn has not yet been fully delivered. Currently, there is no strength to continue. The North China region has been occupied by Japanese yarn, so there is naturally no hope. Although there are purchases along the Yangtze River, the quantities are extremely small, resulting in a scattered atmosphere and a very flat market.</p>
<p>▲ Human Bids Loose</p>
<p>Before the opening of the human bid market, American cotton rose slightly. Sentiment in the market was moderate. Prices for all months fell by four or five cash. In the afternoon, raw cotton loosened, and the market became softer again. Trading in the market was very scarce. Prices for all months fell again by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 cash. The total trading volume for the day was 14,400 bales. Sales included Da Feng (900 bales), Ren Feng (400 bales), Yi Tai (550 bales), Chang Feng (600 bales), Xie Sheng (1,000 bales), and Yong Da (650 bales). Purchases included Yi Chang (750 bales), Rong Xing (450 bales), and Xin Cheng (1,050 bales). The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>▲ Yarn Sales Stagnant</p>
<p>Sales of existing yarn are relatively sluggish. Total purchases by various native banks for the day were only 615 bales. Prices fell by 5 to 7.5 cash. The amounts purchased by each party are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong  85   Sichuan  305   Total  615 bales</p>
<p>Inland     105  Counterparts 2</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Trending Downwards</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending weaker. Indian cotton prices are rising sharply, so buyers' sentiment remains strong, with no intention of selling. The overall situation remains in a state of consolidation. The market weakened sharply in the afternoon due to the dumping of 2,000 piculs of September/October futures by Xin Huo Ji, with an opening price of 30 taels and 5 cash. This was around one tael higher than the current cotton price. After this news spread, the market fell slightly. However, the situation for foreign cotton remains firm.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Bid Affected by New Cotton Dumping</p>
<p>The opening of the Zheng bid market was tense, continuing the sentiment from the previous day, with prices for all months rising by 5 fen to 1 cash. The market suddenly fell in the second and third rounds, with fewer buyers. Prices for all months fell by 5 fen to 1.5 cash. The market price fell again in the afternoon due to the dumping of new cotton, with prices for all months falling by 5 fen to 2 cash. The total trading volume for the day was 52,900 piculs. Sales included Chang Feng (3,100 piculs), Geng Feng (1,100 piculs), Yuan Da (1,800 piculs), Yi Chang (1,900 piculs), and Yong Da (1,500 piculs). Purchases included Sui Long (3,300 piculs), Geng Feng (3,400 piculs), Chang Pei (3,500 piculs), and Chang He (1,500 piculs). The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Zheng Bid  Closing Increase/Decrease  Account Balance</p>

<p>August     3365    Down 20  55100</p>

<p>November   3340    30      268500</p>
<p>▲ New Cotton Trading Begins</p>
<p>Demand for existing cotton is gradually becoming active. Trading of new cotton has begun. Generally, the weather this year is also favorable, so the new cotton business has started earlier than last year.</p>
<p>Xin Huo Ji  30.50</p>
<p>Chong Xin Factory purchases 2,000 bales of September/October for delivery to the factory.</p>
<p>Ling Bao Cotton  36.00</p>
<p>Shen Xin Factory purchases 500 pieces for spot delivery at the warehouse. 35.75</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets All Trending Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton was initially firm due to strength from Wall Street and active buyers. Later, prices retreated slightly as some longs took profits. Futures rose by 6 to 10 points, and spot prices rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 15-16 points, and spot prices rose by 15 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 15 points. Indian cotton was firm due to buying by speculators at the close. Phalgul rose by 4.25 rupees, Omra rose by 9.75 rupees, and Broach rose by 8.25 rupees.

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>He Xia Rice Market Firm</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, arrivals from all sources in Shanghai South were less than 10 ships, and stocks at the docks have become scarce again. Arrivals of Changshu and Wuxi japonica rice were particularly abundant. Local retailers favored early indica rice the most, with bulk prices remaining stable. Native banks showed little interest, and prices decreased by 5 fen. New japonica rice was sold as soon as it arrived, and there was no supply of Glutinous rice available. Foreign glutinous rice was affected by foreign rice prices, with prices lower by several cents.</p>
<p>The market is becoming increasingly flat and listless, with limited fluctuations. Top-quality Changshu and Wuxi rice is slightly softer. Arrivals of indica rice are sparse, with sluggish sales. Market prices have hardened slightly by several cents. New japonica rice sales are still good, and prices remain firm. Native banks showed slight interest in foreign glutinous rice, with no price increases or decreases. Arrivals from Wuxi, Jiangyin, Yixing, Songjiang, Fengjing, Jiashan, Tongli, and other locations totaled approximately 2,000 piculs from 15-16 He Xia cargo boats.</p>
<h3>Initial Weakness Followed by Stability in the Flour Market</h3>
<p>▲ The Flour Exchange Restores Full-Day Trading Today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed initial weakness followed by stability in all months after the morning opening. Foreign wheat prices retreated by a small margin of 2-3 cents, and non-industry sentiment was quite weak. However, although market sentiment was poor, northern buyers continued to purchase actively. Therefore, prices gradually rebounded in subsequent trading sessions. As for the mills, only a few offered flour, as it was difficult to sell. Without significant fluctuations in foreign wheat prices and with continued active buying, there is no expectation of further declines. As a result, August and September contracts were up 2.5 li from the previous day, October, November, and December contracts were up 5 li, and January contracts were up 2.5 li. Starting from the 18th, the flour exchange will restore full-day trading, with trading hours from 10:00 AM to 2:30 PM.</p>
<h3>This Month's Wheat Sales Are Particularly Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw foreign wheat prices down by a small margin of 2-3 cents in all months after the morning opening. Non-industry buying was also not active, and a soft trend was evident in the consolidation. However, at the afternoon opening, the current month's market suddenly showed weakness as large longs were eager to sell. It was rumored that the deliverable quantity for the current month was between 3-5 truckloads, but the collection of goods had not yet been centralized, resulting in strong selling pressure and an unstable market. Distant months also showed slight declines. As a result, August fell by 7 fen, September fell by 4 fen, October fell by 3 fen, November fell by 2 fen, and December fell by 1 fen. The spot wheat market was slightly more active, with Wusong wheat opening at 3 taels, 3 mace, and 8 fen, Guzhen wheat at 3 taels, 8 mace, and 5 fen, Jiangbei wheat at 3 taels, 4 mace, and 5 fen, Zhenjiang wheat at 3 taels, 3 mace, and 7 fen, Penglai wheat at 3 taels, 3 mace, and 4 fen, and Chongming wheat at 3 taels, 3 mace, and 5 fen, totaling over 1,300 bags.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Remains Stable</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market was not active yesterday. However, sellers were holding firm due to high costs, and the amount of rice in circulation was less than one-third of the total inventory. Although the total inventory in the city was over 1.3 million bags, some were stored in Japanese merchant warehouses, some had not been converted into warehouse receipts, and some were pledged and not moving. Therefore, sentiment turned stable, and the market did not show significant weakness. The total quantity offered in the market yesterday was less than 2,000 bags, with Saigon rice and glutinous rice each accounting for half. Saigon medium-grade rice No. 1 was purchased by native banks from Wuxi at a price of 9 yuan and 8 jiao. Glutinous rice was priced at 9 yuan and 4 jiao to 9 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen. Old glutinous rice was priced at 9 yuan and 1 jiao to 9 yuan and 5 fen, all purchased by local village households.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<p>European and American Silk Sales Sluggish</p>
<p>Overseas raw silk markets, following the sharp rise of Japanese silk, have experienced a subsequent sharp decline. Telegrams from Shanghai to European and American silk companies have not seen any improvement. European and American companies are taking a wait-and-see approach, and Chinese silk merchants are also maintaining a firm stance, resulting in a sluggish market. Yesterday, only Qianli and Yihe purchased 20 bales of Sichuan Yellow silk from the Tieji 13-15 size at a price of 510 taels, and Dachang purchased 5 bales of Shandong Yellow silk from the medium size 13-15 size at a price of 520 taels.</p>
<h3>Shandong Yellow Silk Stocks Gradually Depleting</h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai Stocks Below 3,000 Bales</p>
<p>With no improvement in European and American sales of Shandong Yellow silk, and with silk prices plummeting, Shandong silk merchants are selling at a loss, resulting in thin Shanghai stocks. With improved American sales of White factory silk, American companies are also starting to purchase Shandong Yellow silk, leading to transactions in recent days. Shanghai warehouse stocks are gradually depleting. A survey of Shandong factory silk in various silk warehouses shows that there are only over 2,900 bales.</p>
<h3>Needle and Xiu Mei Teas Sell Well, Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both "Lu Zhuang" and local "Tu Zhuang" Needle and Xiu Mei green teas saw strong interest from British and French companies. However, stocks in the market have been depleted. Chinese merchants are taking an increasingly firm stance, and Needle Mei prices have risen again by four or five taels. Jinlong, Yihe, and other firms all have demand. The market trend is stable and unchanged. However, there are no major transactions for Zhen Mei and Gong Xi teas. British firms have sent many telegrams in recent days, and sentiment remains firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Coarse Granulated White Sugar Market Slightly Firm</p>
<p>▲ Taikoo Sugar's Quota Market Turns Softer</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading volume in the Sugar Guild market was not high. The transaction price for Dutch Sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 14 taels, 5 mace, and 5 fen. Goods at this warehouse were 14 taels and 6 mace. The price for goods where the buyer pays the outstanding taxes was 14 taels and 2 mace and 5 fen. Shipments were scarce, and the market was firm. No. 16 medium granulated white sugar was 13 taels and 7 mace and 5 fen, No. 14 raw granulated red sugar was 12 taels and 6 mace and 5 fen, and Dutch red sugar No. 8/9 was 10 taels, 0 mace, 6 and 7 fen. Transactions were sporadic. Since the factory price of Taikoo Sugar was raised, the price has increased by 1 mace. However, with the decline in gold prices, Quota costs are very high. As a result, shipments from the trading houses have increased, and the Quota market has gradually declined. B Mark was 16 taels, 2 mace, and 5 fen to 2 mace, C.W. Mark was 15 taels, 7 mace, and 5 fen to 7 mace, and H.X. Mark was 15 taels, 2 mace to 1 mace and 5 fen. Although trading is still active, sellers feel looser, and the trend is flat and weak. There seems to be little hope for the time being.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>New Autumn Woolen Fabric Demand Activated</p>
<p>Bījī, Huate Ni, floral fabric, Qiaokeding, and straight raincoats, which are typically sold in early autumn, are all selling well. Local customers are continuing to inquire and trade. Melton, felt, felt bottoms, various woolen fabrics, and heavy overcoat fabrics, which are typically sold in winter, are also appearing on the market. This is due to the cooler weather. The future of woolen fabrics is expected to improve day by day.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Asphalt Autumn Sales Activated</p>
<p>Asphalt summer sales have ended. It is now mid-July, and tanners are preparing to start work. However, with the first gusts of autumn wind and the heat not yet subsided, preparations have been delayed. However, traders must prepare inventory to meet the demand from tanners. Shanghai relies on Hankou for supply, and Zhejiang oil prices are high, so most purchases are made in Hankou. However, Hankou inventories have been scarce for a long time, so any transaction leads to a price increase. According to recent details from Hankou, various locations are preparing for autumn tanning, and sales are gradually becoming active. The market has also shown a sudden improvement. Macheng oil is selling for 18 taels, and Chongjing is selling for 17 taels, 2 or 3 mace, which is more than 1 tael higher than before. Autumn sales have just begun, inventories are depleted everywhere, and the intensity of the market is just beginning to emerge.</p>
<h3>Coal</h3>
<p>White Briquette Customer Sales Gradually Increasing</p>
<p>Yesterday, sales of white coal were quite good. A coal merchant from Henan purchased 170 tons of Coal briquettes from Ningbo, priced at 19 taels. A merchant from Hangzhou purchased 80 tons, priced at 5 fen less. Another 60 tons of Jidu Coal briquettes were priced at 17 taels and 5 mace. A merchant from Jiaxing purchased 100 tons of Mark Coal briquettes, priced at 18 taels, and 114 tons of Liujiang Coal briquettes, priced at 13 taels and 7 mace and 5 fen.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Examination Hall</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Mentioning examination halls makes me sad again. The other day, I calculated the cost of education for children. It costs 4,000 silver dollars for one student to graduate from a domestic university. Now, talking about examination halls means that even with money, there are no good schools to study in. It's truly pitiful.</p>
<p>The schools in the interior are often poorly run with lower standards. This is an undeniable fact. Shanghai schools are more complete, so residents of Shanghai naturally send their children to study in Shanghai schools. Even those living in the interior send their children to Shanghai in batches to study. But once in Shanghai, which school to try to get into? That's where the difficulty arises. Comparing the schools with better reputations and more complete content, there are actually very few in Shanghai. Even the few more famous schools are very difficult to get into. The number of openings is limited, while the number of applicants is extremely crowded. Assuming there are only 100 openings, there are often more than 1,000 applicants. Getting into such a school is more difficult than passing the imperial examination to become a scholar.</p>
<p>So, some people who know the principals ask them for help, and some who know the teachers ask them to speak up. If they don't know anyone directly, they ask someone to introduce them. After much effort and careful planning, if they succeed, it's considered a stroke of luck, and they shout congratulations. If they are rejected because the quota is full, would they keep their children at home and not let them study? They reluctantly consider the next best option and choose a school with a slightly lower reputation to apply to. But even these schools are not easy to get into, so they ask others for help in the same way. If they still don't succeed, they have no choice but to send their children to a general "wild chicken" type school.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are many such "wild chicken" schools, like cigarette paper shops on the street. You can say that every street has them. Their principle is like Han Xin leading troops: the more, the better. Their only good point is that they only recognize money, not people. As long as you pay the tuition on time, you can study or not, it doesn't matter to them. They have several advantages, which I can briefly mention.</p>
<p>One: They have more holidays (because every extra day of holiday means one less day of food costs).</p>
<p>Two: They hire incompetent teachers (the principal is thrifty, calculating teachers' salaries by the month. If it's less than a month, they calculate by the hour, so good teachers don't want to go there).</p>
<p>Three: The school curriculum is sloppy (the subjects required by the ministry's regulations naturally cannot be omitted. The regulations may be grand, but the lessons can be shallow. For example, a history and geography teacher may also teach English, or an English teacher may also teach other subjects, accommodating as needed).</p>
<p>Four: The school has no order (these "wild chicken" schools are naturally most afraid of disturbances or students saying bad things about them, so they don't dare to be too strict with the students).</p>
<p>Their advantages are too numerous to list. I've only mentioned four. However, graduating from such a school presents another difficulty. After graduating from primary school, they can't get into good middle schools. After graduating from middle school, they can't get into good universities. So, graduates from "wild chicken" primary schools can only go to "wild chicken" middle schools, and graduates from "wild chicken" middle schools can only go to "wild chicken" universities. These students are always stuck in these "wild chicken" schools as apprentices. In the end, they become "wild chicken" university graduates, which is such a pitiful thing.</p>

<h3>The Latest Air Conditioning System</h3>
<p>— Baitao</p>
<p>Recently, major movie theaters and large hotels are promoting themselves with the latest air conditioning systems. What exactly is this new type of air conditioning system? I suppose that is what you, the readers, would like to know.</p>
<p>The electric cooling device in the new air conditioning system is really a new type of cooling method for modern households. But the scientific principle it applies is extremely simple. Everyone knows that under normal circumstances, water needs to be heated to 212 degrees Fahrenheit to boil. But in a vacuum or at high altitudes, it will boil at a very low temperature. In a vacuum chamber, water boils without fire. Once water boils, it evaporates quickly. That is to say, the water turns into an invisible gas! At this time, it absorbs a large amount of heat. When you wash your body with water, you feel very refreshed after it is wet. This is because when the water on your body evaporates into gas, it takes away a lot of heat from your body, so you feel cool. The electric cooling device is made using this principle.</p>
<p>The cooler contains a very high vacuum chamber, which is created by pumping all the air out of the chamber with a pump. This vacuum chamber allows the liquid to evaporate at a low temperature, and it evaporates into water vapor at a very high speed, absorbing a large amount of heat from the air. Then, the gas is passed through a tube into a condenser, which includes a set of cooling devices (pools, honeycomb radiators, electric fans, etc.) that condense the water vapor into water. The water flows from another tube back into the evaporator, and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>The pump and fan are all powered by a generator, so it is called an electric cooling device.</p>
<p>Recently, there is a newer type of air conditioning system that uses gas flames! This flame is not a fire flame, but a freezing cold air! This freezing cold air can evaporate the coolant, resulting in the recovery of heat and the spraying of cold water, which still changes from gas to liquid. This new type of air conditioning system does not require an electric motor.</p>
<p>There are many of these new type cooling systems in Shanghai lately, When a person feels the scorching heat, being in it, can forget a lot of the heat.</p>
<p>Society Improvement Discussion Group</p>
<h3>Proposal to Establish a Crèche</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Since the commencement of discussions at this conference, some issues, perhaps quite crucial, have been addressed and resolved as thoroughly as possible within the realm of "improvement." I, in my inadequacy, have rarely participated, merely observing the bustling activity during my daily newspaper reading. Consequently, I acknowledge my failure to fulfill the duty incumbent upon every member. However, rather than offering insincere opinions, I have chosen to remain silent, believing this to be more beneficial for my personal cultivation. But now, I am breaking my silence, prepared to present a more practical issue here.</p>
<p>Originally, many issues can only be resolved in a different kind of society, that is, a society where its economic and political machinery has undergone fundamental changes. Many problems that cannot be solved in the real society will inevitably be completely solved because of the change in their economic foundation. However, there are also a few problems that can be considerably improved even in the real society. Although this limited improvement is far from sufficient, it can ultimately lay a cornerstone for the future grand "transformation." In that case, the following proposal may have some significance.</p>
<p>Isn't it true that many gentlemen who pay attention to social ills constantly "lament" the inequality between men and women? Don't many well-educated ladies often feel regretful about being constantly excluded from the political sphere? Don't many hardworking women constantly suffer from male oppression because they cannot engage in production? Of course, these are all inevitable results of China's unique deformed social and political state. However, the bondage of children to their mothers is also the greatest obstacle to women's liberation.</p>
<p>Four thousand years of history have bestowed upon women a supreme belief: a multitude of children is the greatest blessing for mothers. However, this has also predetermined the lifelong destiny of mothers, that is, to become beasts of burden for their children from then on, entrusting everything to the growth and prosperity of their children. In terms of physiology, all women will inevitably have children, and once they have children, they must raise them to adulthood. Moreover, the task of raising children seems to be the sole responsibility of women. Therefore, this is simply a non-issue. However, I believe that if crèches were established, the relationship between mothers and children could be reduced in many ways. I will elaborate on this from various perspectives as follows:</p>
<p>(1) With the organization of crèches, women can reduce the burden of the family and engage in the liberation movement to seek political and economic equality.</p>
<p>(2) Women will not be excluded from the political sphere or lag behind the political level due to the bondage of children.</p>
<p>(3) Laboring women can directly participate in production to seek economic independence and reduce the burden on their husbands.</p>
<p>(4) The development of this kind of organization can enable a portion of women to obtain suitable occupations (serving in crèches).</p>
<p>(5) Children can have healthy bodies through scientific parenting methods.</p>
<p>(6) Children can become accustomed to group life and receive good children's education. Naturally, only with children who are physically healthy and well-educated can the nation have a future for development.</p>
<p>The above explains the significance of establishing crèches. As for how to establish and equip them, it is beyond the scope of one person's opinion. Group efforts are essential for success. In this regard, I sincerely hope that enlightened members will not hesitate to offer guidance, so that it can be realized perfectly.</p>
<p>Finally, there is an additional statement: a certain lady is already actively working to realize this plan. However, due to the lack of funds and talent, it may not be completed for a while. Therefore, in addition to attempting to spark heated discussions here, I am also appealing to society on behalf of the lady, urging fellow advocates to provide powerful assistance.</p>
<p>Family Questions</p>
<h3>A Family Next Door to a "Study Residence"</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Next door to the ancestral home of the Chen family mansion, there was a "study residence" - home to the most famous courtesan in Shanghai. Every night, deep into the night, the lights were bright, the wine was green, people were talking, and the flowers were fragrant, which was the human hell where grease, powder, and bones were eroded and vanished! However, next door was the residence of a certain XX school principal, who was very humble and had the demeanor of a gentleman of integrity. He had only one daughter named Zhenshu, a little girl who did not know the ways of the world, lively by nature, and of good character and appearance. Because the neighbor was a "study residence", Mr. Chen often told her ancient stories of female loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and righteousness in detail, so that she would never forget these good teachings. However, those who are near ink get stained black. The laughter and happy sounds all night long, and the strange and bizarre costumes of the courtesans, stained a spot of pure white on Zhenshu's heart.</p>
<p>Five or six years later, Mr. Chen saw that his daughter's every move had changed. What she had seen and heard in the brothel and "study residence" had wiped out Mr. Chen's more than ten years of family education. He often saw her deliberately imitating the courtesans' dressing style when she came back from school, and she had learned the ugly attitude of flirting and scolding. She even sang the little tunes of "Four Seasons of Yearning" and "Playing Dominoes." Her father was so angry and resentful that he died depressed!</p>
<p>From then on, Zhenshu became more and more unrestrained and dissolute. Someone returning from Suzhou said! Outside the Chumen Gate, on the A'dai Bridge, there is indeed a brightly colored Chen Haohao who stands alone! She is set to be the most beautiful courtesan at the Jinchang Pavilion!</p>
<p>She finally fell! Her fall was due to the word "near" in "those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black"!</p>
<p>Joke</p>
<h3>Country Folk Don't Understand Western Languages</h3>
<p>— Chao Chen</p>
<p>A child from the countryside, newly returned home from school for summer vacation, was reciting English spelling: "P. E. P." "P. W. P." He repeated these two phrases more than a hundred times. A pedantic scholar happened to pass by outside the door and sighed upon hearing this, "This child can be said to understand the principles of books. He says, 'worn leather garment,' 'discard when worn.' This is the meaning of what Confucius said in the Analects: 'Wearing a light fur coat, discard it without regret.'" Worn leather garment means the fur coat is already broken. Discard when worn means discard it when it is broken and there is no need to resent it. A hooligan, A Da, passed by the door a little later and became furious when he heard this, "This child is hateful. He takes me as a bully and wants to avoid me, repeatedly saying 'avoid a bit,' 'avoid a bully.' His words are impolite. I must argue with him." A few moments later, a crooked-mouthed A Er passed by and sneered, "This child dares to mock my crooked mouth. Knowing that my lower jaw is crooked, he wants to compare with me, saying, 'compare a bit,' 'compare the lower jaw.' How impish!" After a while, a hoarse-throated A San passed by and was indignant, "This is too much to deceive, laughing at my throat being too low, a slight change and it becomes mute, saying 'change a bit,' 'change mute.' What grudge does he have against me that he curses me to be mute?" Thereupon, the hooligan A Da, crooked-mouthed A Er, and hoarse-throated A San entered the door together, wanting to pummel the child. Fortunately, the pedantic scholar hurried inside to cite book verses to explain the misunderstanding, and the child was spared from danger.</p>
