<p>莫斯科塔斯社今日發表日本要求引渡蘇炳文將軍與其部屬及蘇聯拒絕之詳細經過、據云、當日代使天羽向蘇聯外次加拉罕要求引渡蘇氏時、加氏告以蘇氏及其部屬之處置、乃蘇聯本國政治上之一問題、非任何他國政府所能過問、按白蘇氏及其軍隊退入俄境、被解除武裝暫時拘留後、日人報紙官方通訊社以至日外部及軍部、有種種關於蘇氏命運之矛盾報告、尤以關於天羽及加拉罕在莫斯科之談話一點爲甚、因是塔斯社特據官方可靠消息、發表其詳細經過如下、在十二月八日、天羽代使代表日政府向加拉罕要求引渡蘇氏及其部屬、天羽轉述其政府之訓令如下、日政府負有維持滿洲國治安之責任、蘇聯政府之解除蘇炳文將軍及其軍隊之武裝、甚爲適當、日政府極感謝、惟此反滿洲國份子雖被解除武裝、如彼等潛回滿境、仍足以危及滿洲國之治安、又如彼等被釋歸中國、則必更激動反對日滿、且將受熱烈歡迎、如馬占山將軍之成一英雄、此種情形、足以助長邊境之頑抗勢力、影響滿洲國之治安、因此日政府特請求蘇聯政府以蘇炳文將軍及其所有軍隊交於日軍處置、加拉罕對天羽之言表示驚訝、謂日本政府不應有此請求、蓋蘇聯爲一守中立之獨立國家、非但不能以蘇氏及其部屬交於日本、即關於引渡之問題亦認爲不能討論、嗣天羽代使表示意見、謂「中立」二字不能用於此案、因蘇炳文將軍不能被認爲戰爭中之一合法獨立方面、蘇氏背叛滿洲國破壞國際鐵路交通、且縱容毁壞及殺人舉動、故　能認爲反對滿洲國之普通罪犯、而非政治犯、伹加拉罕否認此意見、稱之爲「不可思議」因在第一點、自滿案發生後、蘇聯即宣布絶對中立、此事日本非特承認、且曾數度表示感激、再則日政府曾派軍官爲代表、至俄境瑪齊夫斯卡站、欲與蘇氏談判、如認蘇氏爲普通罪犯、日政府當不致至俄國之中立境地、與蘇氏談判和平也、而日政府之正式請求蘇聯爲届間人、接洽與一普通罪犯談判、更爲不可思議矣、加氏又告天羽、蘇聯政府曾因日政府之請與蘇氏接洽釋放一部分日僑、故在蘇氏未退之前、即有大部分日僑安然被釋、而餘者亦由蘇氏携入俄境、此種正當而寛洪之君子行爲、即可斷定蘇氏在解除武裝之後、應否再交於日軍之問題也、最後加氏謂在滿洲及日本境内有千萬之白俄軍人、常圖煽動攻擊蘇聯、惟蘇聯政府迄未要求引渡、而日政府明知彼等不代表、獨立國家、亦未嘗表示可以引渡、蓋知此爲、國之單純内政問題也、加氏告天羽、彼之答復即蘇聯政府對日本政府之正式答復、至是日深晚、天羽又往見加拉罕、表示彼已放棄引渡蘇氏之請求、惟請求蘇聯將蘇氏機續拘留、而在將來處置其軍隊時、應先商　日政府同意、加拉罕答謂對於蘇氏軍隊之處置、已聲明爲蘇聯之一内政問題、不容他國過問、惟在日俄間關係上更有一理由、使日政府不能作此請求、在日本境内、尤以在滿洲境内有數萬白俄享受完全之自由、且在官方包庇下活動、更有在滿洲警務及公務機關供職者、彼等公然活動反對蘇聯、誣陷蘇聯國民、幷挑撥他國對蘇聯之惡感、日政府固未嘗向蘇聯政府商詢對於彼等之處置也、十二月十日天羽又訪加拉罕、重述日政府之二項請求、加拉罕仍以同様理由表示蘇氏及其軍隊之處置爲蘇聯内部政策之問題、不容他國過問云、（十一日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科蘇俄政府峻拒日人聲請引渡蘇炳文將軍及四千餘兵士難民之無理要求後、今日外交副委員長加拉罕對於日本此種要求、深表驚異、聞加拉罕曾向日代表聲稱、北滿難民之處置、純係内政問題、蘇聯政府認爲毫無開談判餘地、並引蘇俄未嘗要求避居滿洲或日本境内之白俄爲例、許日人此種要求爲非正當、現蘇俄政府堅决拒絕日人無理要求、已宣稱無論蘇將軍或難民等、决不有一人交付「滿洲國」或日本當道、而官塲中亦聲稱、蘇俄政府對於現居境内之難民、定將予以必要之保護、至日俄談話之内容、據聞日方辯稱蘇將軍僅爲一刑事犯、將其移交與「滿洲國」或日本當道、並不妨礙蘇俄之中立、加拉罕乃答以最近日司令曾圖藉蘇俄官吏之介、與蘇將軍開和平談判、苟日本認彼刑事犯、如何能企圖與彼作和平談判、並引長春哈爾濱等處日員數次來俄境企圖開和平談判之事實爲佐　、日人又謂蘇部雖經解除武裝、仍足爲滿洲之威脅、深恐此等軍隊歸國後、將成爲英雄、足以鼓勵滿洲其他軍隊之背叛、並稱馬占山將軍之抗日、引起義軍之繼起攻擊「滿洲國」、迄今不已、可爲前鑑、加拉罕答稱、數萬白俄、目下避居滿洲、常爲本國之威脅、但莫斯科與東京間、未嘗一度商榷及此、日人聲請移交難民之要求旣經蘇俄政府峻拒後、日外交代表又送出東京政府修正之請求、要求引渡軍隊亦已經俄政府拒絕、聞蘇炳文將軍業已在赴歐途中、將欲向各國代表陳述滿洲眞相、企圖遇可能時、參加李頓報告之討論云、（十一日國民社電）</p>

<h3 id="c20">二次内政會議之展望都良 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>國民黨之三中全會。將於十五日開始召集矣。三十七席之法定人數已有四十餘人决定出席大會當不至於流產。據傳此會討論之問題將以外交内政爲主。際茲國難嚴重關頭外交方針。固應確定而内政刷新。亦爲急需。且此二者確有密切連屬之關係。今於三全大會舉行之前。先之以第二次内政會議。昨日已經開始到會者亦甚踴躍。尤可想見中央對於内政之特别重視。其欲以整齊之步調。謀切實之補救。固非可與昔日之空具形式無補實際者等量而齊觀矣。夫國民黨爲今日吾國唯一把握治權之政黨。内政部又爲全國一切政治施行之最要機關。其在舉行重要會議之時。自非與政治絶緣之人。孰不致其殷切之期望與同情。顧就歷届各種會議而言。提案非不堂皇。言論非不慷慨而　經决議之後。往往留中不發。滿塲熱烈之情緖。每隨大會之閉幕而俱就銷沈如是。則大會尙有何等之意義可言。其價値適等於一般大人先生之　團談笑一回消遣一回而已。局外人一再失望之餘。又寗能怪其存心漠視不形喜戚乎。此次舉行内政會議之先。各要人非正式發表意見。以亦鑒及異日空洞發揮之無謂。知非切實執行不可。則改弦更轍。當必有一新本届會議之氣象者。古人云。「爲政不在多。言」吾願出席會議之各代表深體而曲味之。</p>
<p>以言刷新内政。首在澄清吏治。而欲澄清吏治。爲道亦非一端。就切對時弊言。原則上有下列三點可以注意。</p>
<p>第一在明課責任。今日一般中下級之行政官吏。大都不曉吏治爲何物者。未作官之前無抱負。已到任之後無策略。其目的在國利以自肥。其手段在圓滑以取巧。上焉者但求無過。下焉者毒痛四郷。在環境苟安之下。泄沓以行事在形勢迫促之時。急遽以掛冠。故以言建樹。則等於緣木求魚以言勤民。則幾於書餅充　如斯之『吏』何『治』可言。補救之道。要在切實制定規條。課以責任。隨時予以嚴密之考核。　白之勸懲。而尤不能聽其以一走了事。務使作官者確知吏職之非可等閒浮沈。來去不能從容自如。夫然後可以免　等之弊。塞倖進之門</p>
<p>第二在嚴定處分。今日政治家貪汚充斥。殆爲無容掩飾之事實。而此貪汚之造成。固由於僉猾者流不自愛好。輕於以身試法。亦由法之範勤太疏。不足以怵嘗試者之念。彼以徒手來者。以滿載歸。志在求富。豈欲常保厥官。免職撤職。庸何傷其毫髮。記過罰俸。等而下之。更無足論矣。故在懲治貪汚法中必須提高處分之程度。而對症發藥尤應先之以查抄家產。繼處以最嚴重之刑罰。如此。庶可寒貪汚之胆。絕瞻徇之途乎。</p>
<p>第三。在確予保障。全國從政者流。除貪汚好滑而外。寗遂無潔身爲之士。徒以任期乏確實保障。致幹略無展施可能。或此身甫爾下車。而遽逢遷調。或政令纔見設施。而突遭擱置。灰心失望之結果。亦惟有相率趨於泄沓之行聚歛之途耳。嘗聞某局長到任伊始。其幕友爲擬一精密之理財計畫以進。局長顧而笑曰。計畫不可謂不澈底。然期之收效。至早當在十年以後。斯職且不知幾度易人矣。某局長之言。殆爲一般有爲之士共有之感慨。而亦事實上使政治無法清明之癥結點。故今茲内政會議。應確定一保障任期之辦法。務使下級官吏之任用有不能隨一二上官之意思爲進退者。而同時般在職之事務官。尤不能隨政務官之進退爲轉移。庶幾吏民之際。藉時日之關係。增融洽之情緖。於合作前途。必有　良之影響。宜與存五日京兆之心者有間矣。　　凡上所云雖爲老生常談。要是一般國民共有之屬望。敢藉時會。申述之。以促當局之注意。以期切實之施行。</p>

<p>（一）查煤鑛爲文明民族必需品、爲近代工業主要燃料、爲防止私人壟斷、漸成賢本專制計、爲避免貧富不均、致生社會革命計、揆諸總理遺訓悉當由國家經營管理之、我國鐵鑛因以往國賊奸商之工於媚外、幾完全斷送於日人手、漢治萍公司、其先例也、若言煤鑛、撫順則淪於日、開灤則喪於英、政府對於兩鑛雖有整理委員會之設立、然以積重難返、荏苒數年、無能挽救、前車旣覆、何堪重蹈、此「中」「福」不宜合併之理由一、</p>
<p>二中螈煤鑛、近年因福公司停工、獲利頗厚、且太行山一帶、人稠地　、所恃爲生存之命派者、厥爲煤鑛以故千百年來自採自銷、差能自給、白福公司侵略鑛權以來、舊有民窑盡被强佔、抬價居奇、人民生計幾絕、地方秩序已呈　　不安之象、幸有中原公司之產生、對於土著工人尙能容納、煤價减低、民困亦蘇、目該地每年銷煤額數以現時中原公司力量、足以供給而有餘、若令合併、舉兩鑛而壟斷之生產與資本集中至最高程度則貧者愈貧、寓者愈富、地方經濟情形必大受打擊、民生失其依據、紛操勢難收拾　、此「中」「福」不宣合併之理由二、</p>
<p>（三）若曰合資經營、爲中央規定之原則、准許外人没資、亦係根據鑛業法令、凡我國人自當遵從、謹按總理利手外資之遺敎、實業計　序言「發展之權操之在我則存操之在人則亡、」然按福公司於清光緖二十四年與豫豐公司訂立之合同、有凡調度鑛務、與開採工程、由公司總董經理豫豐公司總辦會同辦理、又各處鑛廠應用華洋董事各一人、華董理交涉、銀錢出人、洋董總理、華董稽核以上條欵、在比時觀之、華董未嘗無權、乃行之未久、黑幕揭破、所　豫豐公司名義及華董職權、完全化爲鳥有、而鑛產遂爲福公司所獨佔、貽誤至今、莫能自拔、權操於人、噬臍何及、又查中原公司在民十四年四月股東會議修正章程第八條、載股票不得轉售或抵押於非中國人、在以前軍閥政府時代、猶以所定股票尙不准外人收買在、在黨治之下、而用此下策、授人以柄、誠　匪夷所思當局賢明諒不出此、以地利尙未開發之中國、本身以限於財力故、或需仰給外商之資財、以開發之、並非指無外人合資之必要時、亦須引爲我用若以此案爲國際間交換之條件、與友誼之互助、則在中國未開發之實業必須合資者尙多、固不必斤斤以「中」「福」中鑛之合併、而見好於英人也、此「中」「福」不宜合併之理由三、</p>
<p>（四）我國煤產、年達二千五百萬噸、其中日本經營之撫順、英人操縱之開灤、年產幾一千四百萬噸、已超全國產額二分之一而强日該二鑛產量富、耐耗費輕、兩鑛近更跌價競銷、國煤慘敗將無法自救若再加以中福合併、不啻又添一國煤　之勁敵、趨勢所及、將淪於萬刦不復之地、且英商開平以合灤州而存、福公司以離中原而敗、合則利在人、不合則利在我、其事王明、其理至顯此「中」「福」不宜合併之理由四</p>
<p>（五）查中原公司在民國十四年十月股東會議修正章程第八條載、股票不得轉售贈與或扺押於非中國人、在以前北方軍閥政府時代猶以所定股票不准外人收買、尤以在萬惡之袁世凱執政之時期、尙許國人合組之中原公司與福公司用分採合銷辦法、以泯競爭、今併此而氣之、在此黨治之下、而演成此種現象、其何以雜護國本、其何以見信人民、此「中」「福」不宜合併之理由五、（六）查福公司原合同第四十一條所載、「如　方對於本合同各欵否認其全體或一部份者、本合同卽將作爲無效「等語福公司違背合同、至今不能履行、業經博愛縣屬民衆代表緘電聲訴、本年五月、福公司總理柏達在河南建設總會議席上、當博愛民衆代表亦阿認錯誤、其不能履行合同之事實、已昭然若揭、爲今之之計、惟有乘時宣布此項合同之無效、以解除數十年來不平等條約之束縛、乃計不出此、反將自營有利之中原公司强合於英人據爲侵略工具及達背合同之福公司、誠不知是何居心、又前福中總公司合銷時代、股東利益每届不及一分、現今中原公司居然能分紅二分三釐、此卽係不與福公司合作之切效今若與之合併、紅利勢必被福公司剥奪百分之五十、就合同效用言、惟有取消之一途、就股東利害曾、决無合併之需要、此「中」「福」不宜合併之理由六、</p>
<p>（七）查福公司結怨地方甚深、此次試行開採、修博民衆不期而齊集於礦區附近、拚死以爭者、數萬或羣、如必欲令其復工、與中原公司合辦、雖絶不釀成重大事愛、此「中」「福」不宜合併之理由七、</p>
<p>總上七因、「中」「福」不可合併之理由、甚爲顯著、乃實業部當局不能趁此時機自解束縛、反爲福公司一方甘言所誘惑、置百數十萬之生鑿於不顧、倡茲合併之膠議、以圖獻媚於外人、羣情惶惑、岡知所措、迫不得已、惟有仰懇鈞府俯順與情、迅予令行政院轉飭實業部、卽日廢止「中」「福」兩鑛合併之議、以維民意而保國權、</p>

<p>市商會主席委員王席委員王曉籟演説辭、今天本市商會童子軍、爲淞滬戰役殉難的羅毛應鮑四團員開追悼會、承黨政軍機關及各界來寳、親臨致悼、一方是表示對於死難的敬仰、一方是對於繼續而來的國難、想借此引起深刻的認識謀一個大大的自救方法、所以我們發起這個會、曁各界惠臨的意思不是裝裝場面、凑凑熱閙的、曉籟以商會主席的名義、關係是比較來得更密切一點、並且是我主使他們服務的所以今天更有無限的傷感、第一這個童子軍是商會敎練成就的、他們與商會的關係、就是父兒同子弟一樣、四個團員的殉國、就是同自己的子弟殉國一樣、這四個人、都是勇敢有爲的靑年、他們活着應做的事、正多着呢、這樣一來就把他們埋没了、連屍身都没有看見、實在是一件很傷心的事但是從另一方面説呢、太史公有過這麽一句話、呌做死有重於泰山、有輕於鴻毛、所以他們的死、爲救濟同胞而死的、爲不屈服於敵人而死的、是中國童子軍的光榮、也是四團員家族的光榮、又是我中華民族四萬萬人之光榮、換一句話説、我們的子弟、難道不願意他去做史可法·文天祥定要他去做鄭孝胥·于冲漢嗎、我想决没有一個父史、願意這樣的、服務戰地的童子軍、因爲他是個救護員、不是戰鬥員、本來是没有給敵人殺害的道理、但他們那能廢到這些道理呢、現在國難一天一天擴大起來、我們童子軍服務的精神、亦要天一天增加起來、將來犧牲的地方、就不是多着呢、國家到這個地步、我們要避免危險是避免不來的只有硬着頭皮、從自救的一條路上去去幹、所以我希望我們的童子軍、我們童子軍的家族、都把勇氣鼓勵起來、不要爲四個團員的慘死、就此灰心短氣、第二、我們的追悼會、不是鬧着頑的、就是要使國内没有遭難的同胞、翻遇來想想、我們東北整千整萬的義勇軍、同敵人拚命、死的死、傷的傷、悲壯熱烈的情形、不是比較我們的童子軍、加上百倍千倍嗎、那末、還有什麽人開追悼會呢、爲什麽没有呢、就因爲東、二省的人民、巳變了亡國之民、你要有些表示、他就當你叛逆、殺個暢快、古語有句話、呌做死無葬身之地、東三省的義勇軍、已經到了死無葬身之地的日子了、所以我們今天的追悼會、不　是追悼我們殉難的四個童子軍、亦就是追悼整千整　爲抗日而死的無名英雄、但是光是追悼、有什麽用我們必須有收復失地的决心收復失地的準備、那麽今天的追悼會、才是有意義的、童子軍的條件、是智仁勇三字、我説我們救國的｜作、亦離不開這三字孔子解脱智　勇三個字的定義、呌做好學近乎智、力行近乎於　、知恥近乎勇這三句話、照現在的情形説起來的磪是對症發藥要救國先要研究學問、没有智護是不行的、要救國就得切實去做、空言是不行的這就是智　四個字定義、第三句話、其意義更深切了十九路軍與東北義勇軍、論起物質上設備誰都比不上敵人、他們所以税死如妇的緣故、就是把國恥兩個字、深印在腦筋所以什麽都不怕、這就呌做知恥近乎勇所以我們的追悼、不是凑凑熱閙就是要請大家把智仁勇三字作個信條、同担起這副救國的責任、這就是曉籟個人一點的感想、有説得不對的地方、要請各位來賓指敎、</p>

<p>中國童子軍總會籌備主任朱家驊代表徐觀餘演説云、今天這個四殉難童子軍追悼會、是中國童子軍有史以來最哀痛最光榮的集會、爲什麽、後生可畏靑年人的前途是無限量的國家多喪失一個靑年人、便多增加國家一份的損失尤其是年長的人愛護後起的心緒比較熱烈、對這一種損失特别感覺着哀痛、何况這四位殉難童子軍的犧牲、其事實和痛苦、都非第墨言語所能形容的啊、其次爲什麽覺得最光榮呢、我們都知道、人類生命的存在、是有二種原素、一是肉體、一是精神、但是肉體是有時間的、大至於人、小至於鷄鵝、都不能抵抗死的降臨、然而精神是永遠的、我們要求精神的永遠雖至犧牲生命亦所不惜、這才是我們最高潔的行爲、那末、我們要怎樣使得精神能夠遺留永遠呢、就是以自己的人格·事　·學術·言行·來貢獻人類成就世界、提高國家的地位、促成民族的幸福、卽如古人所謂、「立德立功立言、」現在這四位殉難童子軍、因爲愛國助人、服務社會扶阵難民、竟遭慘殺、對方的殘暴的行爲、我們都知道、現在不必去細説但是這四位烈士發揚童子軍的美德、舍己救人、成就像今天這樣的榮譽、此不獨死者含笑於九泉、我們是中國童子軍的一分子、都應當深引爲榮的、｜從上述兩個意義當中、我們就斆是有兩種工作、今後需要我們去努力第一、我們要想怎樣消除像今天這樣的哀痛、換言之、就是要怎樣消除造成中國民族哀痛的一切阻力、簡單的解説、就是要想方法、求國家的獨立與自由、國際地位的中等、那末以後就不會發生這樣的哀痛了、最近幾十年來中國軍民像這四位童子軍之死是没有數字的統計的、我們翻開歷史、和最近的紀載一看、都知道很詳細、我們要時時警醒着、第二要保持這樣的光榮、而且要發揚光大怎樣呢、我們能夠認眞執行童子軍　詞規律、勵行總理遺敎、在國家做一位忠誠的國民、在社會做一位濟弱扶傾勇於服務的良民、在家庭努力做一位爲父母分担責任的分子那就可以了、每個童子軍如此、每個中國靑年又如此、中國民族自然會偉大强盛起來、不再受人侮辱欺負的、旣然如此、我們又廳該怎樣去努力實現上述兩種工作、我們今後不要灰心、不要自棄也不必悲傷、只有大家肯抬頭挺胸、像駱駝這樣的耐勞負責、像獅子這樣的偉大勇猛、像獵犬這樣的活潑機警、像綿判這樣温柔和平、認定烈士所流的勢血、是照着我</p>

<p>（問）貴部復興京滬滬杭甬路、聞將在眞茹設立聯運總站在江灣設立客運總站、其需要情形如何、（答）上海市政府、前頒布上海市市中心區域計劃、擬設客運總站於市中心之西中山北路之旁、貨運總站、則沿京滬路向市郊偏僻部份移出、設於眞如附近並以現有北站、阻碍閘北交通、主張遷讓、本部顧及市政發展、爲大衆之福利、而鐵路本身、亦確有遷移之必要遂决定在中山路與交通路交叉點之西、建築兩路聯運站、所佔地面、在現時路綫之南北兩方、即眞如區及彭浦之内、至客運總站、則設於江灣、（問）兵燹之後、元氣未復、何不仍就北站原扯、恢復舊觀、而必於此時大興土木、（答）上海市面、發展極速、現有車站、爲三十年前之計劃、現時上海人口增加、商業興盛、較之三十年前、大有霄壤之别、以其地位及設備而論、早巳不足應付目前需要、早晚必須遷移、不過未經兵事損失、或尙可因陋就簡、敷衍時、此次破壞、雖屬極爲慘酷不幸之事、然在建設方面、實一新的機會、因原有車站、終必爲大勢所迫、不得不遷地爲良、若一時因仍舊貫、則將來修復之後、再行拆除移建、其損失之大、更難　度、故不如毅然决然、趁此機會、詳密籌劃、爲一勞永逸之計、一方面可以促鐵路之進步、而便利客貨之運輸、一方面助市政之發展、而增加人民之福利、</p>

<p>常春生君訊：我是一個高中將要畢業的學生，每天在學校裏上課下課忙個不了，無非是聽敎員先生們的灌輸式的講授，讀些機械的課本，實在使人感覺得乏味。看看我們的國家社會，腐敗　濁，到了無以復加的地步。外患日甚，而國事依然如此，社會的惡濁亦一天比一天更甚，眞所謂事無可爲了！方面。亦看不到有什麽人眞能負起這個救國救民澄淸社會的責任，前途眞是不堪設想！在這種狀况下，實在使人感覺到人生的無意義，生活只有苦痛毫無快樂，前途旣無希望，讀書求學又是爲些什麽？我眞願脱離這種惡濁的社會，無希望的國家！我眞不知我應當如何才好！貴報是全國人民的指導者，先生們學識豐富，經騐充足，對於像我這樣煩悶的靑年，必願抽其餘暇予以指導的，故敢不揣冒昩，請求指敎，尙望不棄而敎導之，那就幸甚了！</p>
<p>覆：依據來函所述，你之所以發生煩悶，有兩個原因，一是因爲對於「灌輸式的講授」和「機械的課本」不感覺興趣，另一是因爲「國家社會腐敗惡濁」，而感覺得「事無可爲」。你能感覺到這樣的煩悶，這巳經證明了你是一個有思想的靑年，至少不是一個醉生夢死的靑年。你巳經在尋覓出路了，我們相信，在不斷的尋覓中，你一定可以找着一條正確的出路。</p>
<p>檢視引起你的煩悶的兩個原因，關於前者，那是很簡單的，也許是敎授者不得法，不能引起學者的興趣，也許是你自己别有所思，對於死板板的敎室生活，不感到興趣，但咎决不在於「課本之機械」，機械的課本，假使你能把它活用，把知識和行動打成一片，換言之，即於課堂裏用了腦之外，再於課堂外用手實騐，你一定能覺悟到「課本」並不是「機械的」，而「讀書並不是「苦事」</p>
<p>關於後者，自然這是我們民族當前一個極嚴重的問題。内亂外患，交相煎迫，在這種局勢之下，我想，只要是不甘醉生夢死的人，便没有不深切地感覺痛苦感覺煩悶的。</p>
<p>但，我們認定：這問題並不是煩悶所能解决，煩悶只能殺死你自己，陷我們民族於更黑暗更無望。同時我們又認定：惟勇者乃肯立於問題的正面，亦惟勇者乃能從問題中求午解答。只要中國人都肯立在問題的正面，不廻避問題，同時肯從問題中求解答，則中國是决不會無望的。就是高麗和印度，國巳亡，民巳爲奴，而他們亡國的孑遺，對於他們的國家也還没有絶望，還在不斷的奮鬥，何况我們的國家還没有淪入高麗和印度那樣悲慘的境地呢？</p>
<p>你是一個靑年，而且是一個學生靑年，你是我們國家未來的主人，換言之，我們國家的問題，便擺在你的兩肩上，没有辦法，你便得想辦法，没有出路，你便得想出路，你不應廻避問題，你不應卸脱責任，你不應該等待他人，煩悶嗎？煩悶除了只能殺死你自己而外，適足以我們的國家走上眞着有辦法的死途。</p>

<p>高潛庵君訊：年來世風日下，道德淪喪，奸殺盜淫之新聞，充斥報章，幾令人疑報紙爲專紀社會罪惡而刋者。徵諸往昔，每値亂世凶年，固亦多殺人越貨爭奪搏噬之事，然世界淪爲盜匪，决無如今日之甚者，推厥原因。蓋禮敎廢弛，邪説横行之害也。今之　心君子，徒知呼號奔走於禦侮救亡，而不知世道人心如此，國家命脈已絶，雖無强寇之來，終必滅亡，本末不明，行見其無濟於事耳。故鄙意以爲救亡必自挽同世道人心起，禮敎繩紀尤爲存亡關鍵，不則雖有回天之力，終必事無可爲，諸先生以爲然否。費報爲社會先導，有矯正人心之責，挽此末俗，端領先覺，此則鄙人所深望於貴報者也。</p>
<p>覆：來書以今日世道人心之每况愈下，世界淪爲盜匪，引爲莫大之殷憂，此固吾人所同有之感覺。惟來書一歸其原於禮敎廢弛，邪説横行，而欲以維持禮敎綱紀爲挽回世道人心，救國爱於危亡之道，則不能苟同，古人曾有言：一民富則不可以祿使，貧則不可以威罰，法令之不行，萬民之不治，貧富之不齊也。」又云：「凡治國之道，必先富民，民富則易治，民貧則難治。」「倉廪實而知禮節，衣食足而知榮辱。一可見中國今日之成爲盜匪世界，其原因實在於「民不聊生」，而非邪説黄行有以致之　。近世社會學者研究罪惡之來源，多歸根於經濟關係，即有出於遺傳者，其原因亦由於社會，故非特殺人越貨，乃生活壓迫使然，即其他之作奸犯科，亦莫不原於社會制度之不良，罪惡之充斥，正所以證明社會之破産，與民生之竭蹶，故吾人對於中國今日之世道人心，固引爲莫大之殷曼，然所當着眼者，在彼不在此，若不究其眞實原因之所在，而徒以禮敎綱紀爲嘆，是眞所謂舍本逐末，永遠惟有嗟嘆。</p>
<p>爲防衛過當、提起公訴、但對該警身　便　、並携利器、亦屬不合、故審訊後、　告楊團員　交舖保釋去、但前日當辯論終結時、法院方面、突將被告拘押、不准交保、於是浦東全體商民、表示不滿、僉以楊團員因公被誣、事關全體、浦東市民、因於昨日下午二時在塘橋區保衛團召集全體商號代表舉行緊急會議、討論營救辦法、當到代表白餘人、由主席報告當日出事經過、並稱該死警實有圖謀　刦之嫌，後討論結果、認爲楊團員確　因公被誣、必須設法營救、除將經過事實昭告各界、請一致援助外、並議决向市區保衛團等請求主持公道云、</p>

<p>（四）體能此指天生之能力而言、此項能力與體育之關係正如智力之於他種學科有同樣之關係、但在體育界現尙無劃一標準之體能測騐各校所採用者大多未能根據科學方法制定、比較可靠之　準則爲卜氏體能騐（參考）、ＢraceＤＫＭeaurngＭolorＡbilityＡＳＢarnesＣoＮewＹork惟應用時、仍須具有一種研究之精神、</p>
<p>（五）技能　此指學習得來之能力而言、測騐技能方法可分普遍與特殊種、例如從各種體育活動中選出五種六釋或十種之自然動作、如跑·跳·抛·擲·之類、卽可用爲普遍之技能測騐、又可用簡單機器測騐、如體力測騐等、至於特殊之測騐、各種運動各有其自己之測騐、譬如籃球可以用下列幾種測騐、（一）投罰球、（二）投籃·接球·傳球正確、（三）拍球投籃、（四）自由投籃、（五）傳球遠度、以上五種分級方法、（一）與（二）絶對不可缺少、其餘三種亦應完全採用、如果感覺困難時、至少須選用一種、下列三個舉例、可供參考、</p>
<p>（附註）學级與成績之關係、百屬非常密切、但現在一般分級法每忽祝之、須知此種分級標準、亦可使每級獲得其相當之敎學成績、</p>
<p>（例一）打破普通年級制度</p>
<p>第一步　按照性别將各年級學生、分爲男女二組、　　第二步　將一年級男生及女生、各按檢查身體結果、將需要特别矯正恬動者分出爲一組、稱爲「子」組、然後按體能或按能測騐或二者合用　其餘學生分爲「丑＝寅」兩組、在全級百分之三十或四十以下者爲「丑」組、其餘　寅組、</p>
<p>第三步　將二·三年級男生及女生按　第二步分閘、惟　將無須矯正之學生分爲三组、或　在最低百分之二十五或三十以下者爲「丑」組、最高百分之二十五或三十以上者爲「卯」組、其餘中間者爲「寅」组、</p>
<p>第四步　　第二第三兩步所分之組合併、子同子合爲甲组、丑同丑合爲乙組、寅同寅合爲丙组、卯爲丁組、於是全校男女生各分爲甲乙丙丁四組、</p>
<p>第五步　如學生數多、敎員不止一人、則以上四組仍再可分爲若干組如下、</p>

<p>精兵逢勁旅、表演精彩、早在意中、阿迦爾替咸德夏來滬、兩現身手、第一次甲組比賽、六比二大勝臘克斯、第二次史高塔杯二週十比零痛撃依令觀其成續、一望而知爲不可欺者、其前鋒五虎之進取如飛、聯給之純熟巧妙、兩翼鈎球之準確海上難得看見、其幾次自兩角傳送之球不差分毫嘆爲觀止、守鬥亦穏健、所差者後衛稍疏時有失足、西捕對之、亦恐不如雖遭失敗當謂球運不佳、失去之打鬥機會、只可抱怨自己、以表演論之、尙勝東華一籌、</p>
<h3 id="c146">鴻運當頭無往不利 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>東華知敵軍之强、故下特别戒嚴之令、上半時雖破敵門二次、而自己門前、幾成爲敵軍出入之地、無限風波、幸鴻運當頭、一一化險爲夷、李寗防左而顧右、稍一放鬆、卽有覆城之禍、其吃緊有如此者、全軍例外小心以作戰、精彩之倍於往昔、從可知矣、</p>
<h3 id="c147">有門不入險哉險哉 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>東華之得勝、實眞千幸而萬幸、門前團團圍攻而不入、自先中阿迦爾一球後、敵鋒屢次猛攻、一次秦非許盤過李寗、輕傳於中、克拉格對門三尺直射而竟斜出不中、屠開元犯規、海門踢十二碼、亦竟飛於門外、其他若是之險球、不計其數阿迦爾前鋒之中、有左内拉蒙德其人、攻射俱佳、出脚快速、昨日缺席代以奎特、否則形勢或異、</p>
<h3 id="c148">意想不到先進一球 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>執法嚴厲巴拉德、下令開球、五分鐘中、東華數次進攻、皆無所成而退、屠開元在左　球、萬象華得之而進球向中傳、海司的於此緊急之情形中、卒至失足、李義臣遂截得直聞踏定來球、飛起一脚、力量旣足、遂中入網内東華先開紀錄、捧塲者、大放爆伏、聲起四野、此種喜聲、已好久不聞矣、</p>

<p>蘇軍回攻、但攻雖烈、守亦嚴、不能近門、時泰非許傳惠列斯、逼成解球、適落門前、相持三四分鐘、卒告脱險、亦云幸矣、然敵勢仍盛、右翼更勇、時窺邊境、又一次角球後、惠列斯在右角得球而向門前進、屠開元往禦、手吻皮球、晴天霹靂、得來不易、今忽肇成十二碼球大禍、由海氏踢之、蘇軍幾次攻門、巳知鐵門之技、球向右去弄巧成拙、斜出門外、東華相抱大喜幾狂、</p>

<p>大禍化爲烏有、傾全師以反攻、陳洪光傳中央、李義臣傳右翼曹秋亭飛馬趕上、陶却斗見已惹禍、便一釣脚、巴拉德瞥見、立回罰一十二碼球、陳家球砰然送入、因禍反得福、二比零、東華眞夢想不到、在阿迦爾、則倘中此十二碼、則亦不至受罰此十二碼、一出一入、共計二球、羣知阿迦爾敗矣、其後阿迦爾雖盛勢凌人、但不少險球、皆爲鐵門擋出、上半時成二比零、</p>
<h3 id="c151">飛起一頂連中三元 <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>阿迦爾連失兩球、下半時起、仍努力反攻、以圖報復、然攻雖烈、依然無用、東華則一鼓深入、進抵蘇軍門前、萬象華傳中打門陳洪光隨勢一頂、由高而落下、守門亨透與　司的跳起互爭、球未接得、適於此時落入網内、造成三比零、</p>

<p>阿迦爾處此央敗之境、仍然再接再厲、、勇氣可佩、海氏接得來球、射門甚急、　門接而未得、免、克抆格　上、　吳幼良之脚、又脱險境、繼而東華在門前罰球外受罰、休士一脚、恰巧在周賢言手中泰非許在亂軍中攻門、以爲必進、又觸門柱彈回、幸哉東華、休士在左得角球、奎特一頂進門、淸爽可觀、但裁判以中錄撞人、此球作廢、</p>

<p>爲吧城羣力隊首次受挫而作</p>
<p>李君惠堂、自赴南洋吧城經商後、仍未脱離足球生活、與城麟經同在該地之華人球隊羣力効勞、該隊實力强勁、所向披摩、執有該地盟主之勢、不料上週竟以零比二敗於阿里非隊李君身受意外之敗績、雖覺由於幸運之反常、但對於戰術方面、極有研究之價値、遂有「足球戰術的研究」之作、雖爲君力失敗謀以後之改進而發表、亦殊足爲其他球隊之偕鏡、爰特批露如下、幸海上華隊以及國内球界注意焉、（編者）</p>
<p>彈指光隂、跑得眞快、羣力本届首遭挫折後、狠像一刹那間便有一週的距離了、本來早幾天我便要執　來做篇文字、但爲着新近到華安保壽公司去視事稍爲繁冗一點而不能抽出暇晷、一地延遲到現在方能夠和大家談談、想各界不會當作明日黄花罷、</p>
<p>暫時的盟主堡壘、由羣力保持了不過兩星期、竟給阿里非的兩枚砲彈破壞而拱讓他人了、其實、失敗了還有甚麽好談呢、人們會疑惑到我在撤、賴和推諉罷、但我却完全没有這種念頭、我深信那天我們并不是球運不佳、我也不承認球證時有褊袒行爲、也不敢説我那天我方的參加者的表演完全失常、ＯffＦorm（我相信各人都已盡其所能、但馬不進也罷了）如果説進一步、阿里非是僥倖獲勝的、那更屬無稽了、據那次的情狀和踢法而論、他們的勝利報酬、是萬二分値得的、老實説、假使照那天羣力的措施而能打倒阿里非、我也不敢十分恭維、爲的是我們那次所採的應敵和攻守的方略、完全是悖乎正理就使兩隊再賽十塲、如果雙方仍用那天的佈陣和戰法照樣施行、羣力的勝利希望恐怕十中祗佔二三罷、由此一證便知足球的奥妙、和變化是無窮無極的、你不能説强隊一定可以勝弱、（誰都公認羣力爲勢較强）、也不能固執一定的進攻衛和守衛法便可次次成功、球賽中雖則幸運之神有時（並非有很常的成份）、對勝負也有幾分濳伏式的操縱權勢但我們斷不能完全倚賴或嗟怨幸運之神、我們本身須得有一閒常的研究一、「臨時的機變」「球賽中的智慧及常識」、和「隨時能　應付當時環境的善法和技倆、各種寳物、才可以常操勝算、這幾種寳物、運應該是全隊中人人都有的隨身附帶品、一遇要用起來便卽刻拿得出、否則、偌人的戰塲合作起來眞不容易、任你隊中有三數位有寳貝的人物、但首尾毫不呼應也是無濟於事的、又何况人家也非全無法力的呢、</p>
<p>從這裏起、讓我先談我們那番受挫的緣由、阿里非那天採取的陣法是呌作「中路堵塞守衛法ＧenlreＢloＧkingＤefense他們的立心是祇求不讓我們勝球、致於他們前鋒能否建樹便聽憑機會、他們明知我和舊搭擋阿戴麟經性最活動而帶有危險是的人物、所以他們便用三人或四人爲相監視著、（非常嚴密的監視、比看囚犯還來得利害）、藉以牽制着我們的前線、在他們則以爲這種的陣法和戰略、是非常精細美妙而定可收效的、（不錯、結果他們眞的賴着羣力破陣無衛而成功了）但在我看來那種陣法殊非上乘所謂坐困己城終有束手待斃的一日、不過他們那天幸而逢着那無破此種陣法本能的現在的羣力隊否則、如　能施用没散進攻法ＯdenupofＯenfense的隊伍、他們是没有不敗的道理、我以爲他們的後方常常不顧兩翼的進襲、祗顧中路退防是無異引狼人室、策之下者（幸虧那天的狼不甚兇惡的設使我們我像葉北華和曹桂成般的一雙邊將、把球一直帶到端線之端、然後由高處靳球向敵門前面吊下來照樣的再三行之、定不難水到渠成卒收佳果、但那天我們邊將的傳中術Centering殊令人萬分的失望、他們不是時間上的謬誤、便是凖繩上的錯失、感勞往返、反給敵衛以造就英雄的一個好機會、其次三中衛的供球術Centering也大有改進的餘地他們最露的弱點是得球後不能利用妙傳來供給前鋒（奪球雖妙、供球不佳、徒勞無補、失事費時、而且對斬球的蹴法尙欠功夫、FeedingCnop(斬球卽高僅過人的球、遇敵在前來奞最妙以之傳達己方前鋒實爲中衛最適宜之一種踢法、）像那天眼巴巴看見中路給人們牽纒過緊時、就不應仍死守一硬向中路進展致遭阻塞、應該於得球後帶至相當地點、或誘至敵衛之一來奪時用斬球法遼傳給兩翼由邊陲進展、才能擾亂敵方陣脚、但那天斬球式的踢法和遠傳、兩翼的步驟全堤中曾未多見、因此敵人之適人之計遂乘機得售、仍然屯駐重兵於中路而不顧其他哥人雖事實上攻多守少、但因不能設法誘敵散離前鋒射球的機會遂爾减少卒於不得一逞而反被其乘虚攻人兩球是以、根據那天的戰情而論歸結起來與其説是阿里非前鋒勝球、田寗説是阿里非後方勝利與其説是阿里非非把羣力打倒曷不説是羣力本身打倒羣力我們失敗的緣由、不外乎左列數端（一）兩翼傳中術不得法（二）中術供球、不能隨機變更方略、（三）我和阿戴旣受嚴重監視、同隊仍常思以球給我兩人又我兩人外能眞有射門本領的竟無一人（四）在猛攻之下後方忘却本位、被敵前鋒一得球後便乘虚奏功</p>
<p>現在雖則事過情逃但失敗後不求振作便是大懦何况我們亡羊補牢未嘗太晚、錦標前途、希望無限、我們隊裏的材料Ｍalenrial并不遜色、任誰都是可造之良材總求其本人肯濳心推敲、虚懷接納採畏改短和多下苦功還好、照我的觀察、羣力的隊友們都非「旣不能令又不受命」的一輩子頑石、大家須知凡百事藝如果要亨受大名并非一朝一夕便可造就的、大名和成功并不能由娘胎裏携以俱生時藝雖然有時可造英雄、但一個人「惟自己才能創造自己」不可甘心做一個專靠幸運或時勢來光顧的無勇者、（待續）</p>

<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>其他的人聽了這個話好像也想到自家的事，都慢慢走散了。大發回到睡覺的地方，没好氣的把三得挺了一脚，三得像猪一樣的仍舊没有醒也就倒下去睡了。</p>
<p>他又做了另外一個夢。</p>
<p>這個怪夢醒來的時候，有人把他的身子亂踢着，他以爲那就是要把他抓住的人了，猛的一下就跳起來，把眼睛睜大了一看，原來是一個粗布服的黑漢子，手裏揑着一條竹扁擔。那人不防大發會那樣猛的跳起來，倒也嚇得把眼睛睜大了</p>
<p>「猪　，你是瘋了嗎？····老子要做生意啦，還躺在這兒？」</p>
<p>大發看到那扁担的旁邊有一担小靑菜，他再把眼睛望開去，許多大籃子大簍子都裝滿了東西停放着，還有幾個小小的攤子，那個木架上掛滿猪肉跟牛肉。大家正忙着把自家的籃子或攤子整理着。他又看到三得把藍布大褂兒滿臉的揩着，看去倒很精神抖擻的。</p>
<p>「半夜裏開槍捉强盜，我跑去跟着看了，强盜不知道捉到了没有，在那邊轉變地方，却枉死了一個人。」</p>
<p>「不要給他們把你當作了强盜。」三得冷冷的説。</p>
<p>「我把你推幾下，想呌你一起去看，你却睡得像猪一樣，那裏呌得醒？」</p>
<p>「幸好我也没有醒，要是眞的給你吵醒了，看我把你的骨頭都揑斷。」</p>
<p>這麽説着的時候，三得已經穿好衣服想走，忽的脚下一股冷濕的東西使他生氣了。一看是一條慢慢淌着的水流　過他的脚，回頭望了望就知道水的來路了。剛纔把大發踢了兩下的漢子，把大籃子的菜，放在一個管子的旁邊，那管子流出挺乾凈的水，冲過了靑菜的水從籃子底下直流下石　，所以把三得的兩脚都浸透了　　他本來生氣得要　幾聲的，一見到這些很好的白水，就拉了拉大發，一起走近過去，那賣菜的把一個小東西一轉，水就不流了。大發奇怪得問：</p>
<p>「怎麽的？這東西倒眞好。」</p>
<p>「這是自來水啦。」</p>
<p>兩個人把手臉都洗過了，手是冲得很爽快的，臉子總還不爽快，又不好把臉放在管子底下，只得把兩個手掌連起來，彎成一隻大碗那樣的，等冲滿了水，就往臉了上擦去。接着又照這個方法喝了好多的水，兩個人才滿高興的走開了</p>
<p>這條街，這時候跟昨日　就大不相同啦。現在，兩邊都堆滿了　　蔬，有些地方，也來着一個喫點心的小籃子，一塊塊的方糕，三角的白緩子，都冒着柔軟的熱氣還有一堆堆煮熟了的麫；他們站了一會，看見有幾個小販模樣的坐在長凳邊，不知丢了幾個銅子，就是一碗麫，那麫只放了點醬油和麻油，看去就是一碗上好的東西了</p>
<p>站在這種攤子跟前没希望，就混在買東西的人羣中走。提着小籃子的女人慢慢地更多起來，在各種東西面前像狗那樣的嗅着。亂糟糟的一團聲音，夾着魚啊肉啊的許多腥味，送進他們的耳朶和鼻子，各種東西又把他們的眼睛吸住。那一棵棵的極小的小靑菜，鷄毛菜，一個個的庭大的　子，有的一莢莢的毛荳，還有許多他們家鄕中都有的東西，他們都是親手種過的，現在什麽東西都覺得挺寳貴，恨不得伸手去抓一把，就那麽生吃也一定挺有味兒罷。</p>
<p>三得和大發都這樣想，能夠偷到那麽一把眞是夠好啦，若是那個人看見了要閙起來，就還了他算了。但三得看見穿着很好的太太，也雜在人羣中自己買菜，就想等這些人買了好東西以後，伸手到她們籃子裏去偷，比偷小販的東西要公道得多大發因爲想到給水冲翻的家鄉，就呆呆的在一個豆腐攤子旁邊站着，也不看見自家的同伴正在許多小籃子裏用心。</p>

<p>據佛羅以德的分析，夢，是由於受壓抑的下意識，乘人的意識昏睡，失掉控制力的時候，抬頭活動，把平日所渴望而未能滿足壓抑在下意識裏的慾求，用各種各樣形式化裝表演出來的結果。由此我們可以知道，只有夢最自由，當你在酣夢沉沉的刹那，你可以立時成爲一個富翁，可以立時成爲個顯宦，可以和你所鍾情的少男或少女親吻，可以手刃你所毒恨的仇人，可以御風而遨翔天空，可以踏水而浮沉海面，</p>
<p>總之，這裏没有法律，道德，習慣等一切的桎梏和拘束，你的意識可以放縱得如像匹不覊的野馬，你可以滿足你所希望而不能達到的切。</p>
<p>一個少男或是少女所做的常是玫瑰色的夢，一個商人所做的常是發財的夢，而一個政客所做的則常是飛黄顯達的夢。然而却也有不少的人常是做着惡夢，做着復仇雪恨的夢，譬如，當一羣飢寒交迫的奴隸從一天的疲勞中伸長兩脚横七豎八倒在黑暗的地底下室的時候，你能知道他們所做的是怎樣一類的夢嗎？</p>
<p>惟其只有夢中最自由，想什麽便是什麽，所以聰明人便常是在做夢，有時候并白天做夢，譬如聰明人説，公理是終於可以裁制强權的，或者木偶是終於會顯靈的，就算這是「夢，」然而　子們，你能斷定在「未來的未來不會成爲事實嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c161">男子的眞面目 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 婉珍女士</p>
<p>當一個男子正在求愛的時期，他的一言一語，一舉一動，實在可憐而又可笑極了。當他預備去看愛人的時候，總得像所謂閨閣小姐一般修飾半天｜刮鬍子，擦雪花膏，灑頭水，把頭髮梳得光淋淋，皮鞋擦得閃閃亮，再換上一套嶄新的衣服，左拉右扯地把領結打好，未後，在胸前的小袋裏挿上一條美麗的小絲手巾，於是，聳聳肩，扭扭頸，左顧右盼，大搖大擺的出去了。</p>
<p>但他一見愛人，頓時把他剛才在路上的那種活潑瀟灑，洋洋自得的態度化爲烏有，他現在是像臣子見了君王，僕役見了主人般地戰戰兢兢，埀手待命的了。他説起話來，總得裝着笑臉，殷勤恭維，備盡所能；如果看見愛人有不快的樣子，他就像犯了王法似的埀頭喪氣，甚至坐立皆非，寢食難安，大有莫知所措之槪：看見愛人笑了，他就像囚犯得赦，涸魚得水似的欣喜雀躍，樂不可勝。爲要達到被愛的目的，他會用着哀求與嘆息的聲調對愛人説：『世界上的一切，我都不追求，我的唯一的願望是能永遠做你的侍役，奴隸，我要爲你而活，爲你而死，我願···』説得多麽可憐多麽好聽！</p>
<p>隨後愛求到了，目的達到了，在這個時期，他仍舊非常的溫和，非常的馴服。他對於愛人的一切，關切備至，體貼入微。愛人要他上山，他就上山，要他下水，他就下水，愛人要這樣，就這樣，要那樣，就那樣，眞是千依百順，唯命是聽，總之，他這時把愛人看做神仙，把愛人的話看做聖旨，就是爲她赴湯蹈火，粉身碎骨，也在所不辭的樣子。　　現在他巳和她結婚了。起初自然是照舊向她獻殷勤，博她的歡心，可是日子久了，可就慢慢的不對了。他不像往日那麽恭維她，奉承她，敬她，愛她了；他不像往日那麽小心謹愼，俯首聽命了；他現在漸漸地想要操縱一切，霸持一切，儼然擺出丈夫的架子，好像不可一世似的！甚至不高興的時候，便對他妻子竪眉横眼，咆哮呌駡，總要把妻子做洩氣洞。妻子偶有所諫，便説：『你懂得什麽？你不要管我的事！』</p>
<p>再下去可就更不對了，他對他的愛人漸漸厭倦了，他有了别的追求了。他在家裏簡直坐不住了，他一天到晚在外面，偶然回來一下，也不會有好顔色給他妻子的。妻子多問他幾句話，他便要喝住她，説她侵犯子他的自由，不許她囉嗦。</p>
<p>乾脆一句話，他這時已完全露出猢狸尾巴來了，不，已完全露出男子的眞面目來了！</p>
<h3 id="c162">誰説中國敎育不普及？ <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 石</p>
<p>誰説中國敎育不普及，這個人就没有眼。　　你瞧，全國的大學和專門學校，不下四五十。農，工，商，數，理，化，文，法，醫，敎育，美術，體育，····凡是東洋，西洋，各邦，各國所有的科目，我們何嘗缺一項？至於中學，省立的，縣立的，公立的，私立的，全國到處都是。而且也分設有農，工，商，文，敎育等專科，并不曾缺一項。再説小學，那是更多得無從數起。有附屬的，有縣立的，有市立的，有鄕立的····一言以蔽之，應有盡有。</p>
<p>至於在低級的人羣中，與鄕僻些的三家村裏，也並不寂寞，那裏儘有前淸遊不進泮水的八股老先生，戴了老光眼鏡，提了挺硬的戒尺，趕着一羣拖鼻涕的頑皮孩子，實施「子曰」「詩云」道地的國粹敎育。</p>
<p>再説到民衆敎育，那更是不消説。而且眼前。就是例證，譬如小弄口的墻上，總寫着「不准小便」，「烏　小便」等標語，給那些隨意小便的低級人們看。有的索性再畫上一個大龜，這種看圖識字的宣傳方法，非但可以表示寫的人受過敎育，而且這裏是還含有深遠的敎育意義。再如乞丐在上海的馬路上，常常露佈着一大篇英文，字旣工正，文亦流利，外再附加上篇譯文。你想，學貫中西的學者，也僅僅做一個乞丐，我們貴國敎育不是太普及了嗎？</p>
<p>所以我説，誰説中國敎育不普及，誰就没生眼。</p>
<h3 id="c163">雲南的玀㹫（一） <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 王俞</p>
<p>在這兒，我打算把居住在雲南的一種土人向諸君介紹一下。</p>
<p>這種土人通常被漢人們稱作「玀㹫。」</p>
<p>説到玀㹫，似乎並不止一種。有所謂花玀㹫，漢玀㹫和水玀㹫之分。</p>
<p>漢玀㹫，大約是因爲他們多與漢人接近的原故而得名吧，我在這兒介紹的也就是屬於這一種。至於别的兩種，因爲我未曾和他們接觸過，對於他們的生活我也和諸君一樣的一些兒也不了解，甚至於連那花玀㹫的「花」字和水玀㹫的水」字之含意如何，我也不能向諸君解釋。現在就把我所知道的報告給諸君聽吧。</p>
<p>（一）語言和文字</p>
<p>這些人，他們是有着自己的語言和文字的，而且這種語言還可以在緬甸的邊境地方通用，聽説學習起來並不艱難，我曾看見許多常與他們接近的人都能説口流利的玀㹫話。就是我自己，也曾把一二三四五六七八九十這十個數目字的發音學會了。</p>
<p>他們的文字是像西文一般横寫的，聽説也有字母；不過他們用以書寫的不是毛筆，也不是鋼筆，而是一根抽了筋的草（羊齒植物）的葉柄，書寫起來，倒也和鋼笨一般，不過没有鋼筆那般流利而經久罷了。</p>
<p>書籍方面，除了宗敎上的許多經書以外，似乎没有其他著作。而且這些經書都是人工抄寫的。　　（二）關於宗敎的信仰</p>
<p>在每個寺院裡面，我們都可以發現一個龐大的釋伽的偶像，因此我們可以推定他們所信仰的是佛敎。他們的寺院呌做「緬寺」，這緬寺的建築是很偉大的。居住在緬寺裏的是一個「大佛爺和數個乃至數十　的小和尙」。大佛爺有時又呌做是老」，當他死了以後，就由小和尙中的資格較老者繼承他的位置。這個資格較老的小和尙，當長老未死之時，也會被呼爲「二佛爺」的。小和尙呢，他們都是玀㹫的子弟，有些是自願作和尙的，有些是由父母送到緬寺裏去的，有些是被人指定去做和尙的。</p>
<p>大佛爷是不能結婚的。小和尙要結婚時却可「還俗」，還俗就是離開了緬寺而恢復俗人的資格的意思。</p>
<p>通常，在一村或數村中，就有一個緬寺。大佛爺和小和尙在緬寺中·除了誦經以外，甚麽事情都不管，穿的，吃的，都由這一村或數村的人們供給。</p>
<p>大佛爺在這玀㹫羣中，就彷彿基督敎中的牧師在中古時代的羅馬一樣。他會以佛咒替人家治病，每個小孩子初生出來就要請大佛爺祝福他長生，同時給他一根結着許我結兒的繩子圈在頸上，這大約是不許他的靈魂離開他的肉體的意思。當一個人從人間長逝的當兒，大佛爺也要爲他禱告死後的平安與幸福，還要把一根結了許多神秘的結的稻草繩圍在他的墳墓上，意思大約是保護他，不許旁的東西去侵犯他。　玀㹫對於大佛爺就好像對神一樣，連佛爺的父親和母親也必須向佛爺叩頭的。關於此事，據一般的解釋，説是他的父母不是敬重他，是敬重他的「黄被」。所謂黄被者，就是大佛爺和小和尙們的衣服，這與一般的衣服完全兩樣，他們以一幅黄布包圍着他們的下半身，算是褲子，又以一幅較大的黄布像都市中的女人使用圍巾一般的包圍着他們的上半身，算是衣衫。可是這兩幅黄布决不是整幅的，而是以若干片方形的布塊依照一定的排列法製成的。</p>
<p>彷佛基督敎徒要在每個禮拜日到禮拜堂中去「做禮拜」一樣，玀㹫之羣，他們也要在一定的時日到緬寺中去「滴水」。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>海泉本來對於學生生活早有些厭倦了，尤其是理科的生活。並且年　也超過了二十歲，免不了要患在靑年間所流行的一種靑年病，煩悶。本來這種靑春期的煩悶是很容易療治的，只要對症下藥。什麽藥呢？即是解放他們的性和經濟的壓追。但是在中國的社會未改造之前，靑年是不容易從這個煩悶解放出來的。靑年們受了壓迫當然有許多牢騷·由牢騷而詠嘆，終於表現爲一種畸形的文藝，支配了中國的全文壇。海泉雖然是志望理科，但有時覺得前途是没有如何希，不免也抱了悲觀，同時也和一般的靑年一樣，受了上述的壓迫，無時無刻不在煩悶中度生活，所以有時也會發幾句牢騷，詠嘆下自身的生活，而用詩或散文的形式表示出來。唐耀星知道他也是喜歡塗塗寫寫的，所以才走來勸他加入他們所組織的文藝社。</p>
<p>『你願意當我們的社員麽？』</p>
<p>唐耀星的熊度很誠懇。這是由直覺可以看出來的。海泉忽然覺得他的這樣的態度是很可感佩的，不過仍在跬躊躇着。</p>
<p>『我嗎？······』</p>
<p>他偏着頭像在沉想，很不容易决斷的樣子。</p>
<p>『你有什麽懐疑的麽？』</p>
<p>『没有什麽懐疑的。不過我想先會會陳華民先生，問明白了他的文藝上的主張才好。他不能像我們一樣以，ＡrtforＡrt爲立場吧。』</p>
<p>『當然不能。他是有文藝主張的人。你的話不錯。我先把他約好，和你會會面吧。不過，你要絶對秘密！不要告訴任何同學，因爲現在學校裏文藝團體實在太多了，互相毁詆，互相傾軋。····』</p>
<p>『那我曉得。·····』</p>
<p>海泉説着，忽然由文藝聯想到文科的同學，由文科的同學再聯想到早上看見的卓女士來了。</p>
<p>『····你們招女社員不招？』</p>
<p>『暫時不招。中國女子還没有什麽力量。』</p>
<p>『你看文科的卓淑華怎樣？』</p>
<p>海泉説了後，感着一些不好意思。</p>
<p>『你看見她面貌漂亮，是不是？哈，哈！』</p>
<p>『瞎説！』</p>
<p>『没有用的人！』</p>
<p>唐耀星態度嚴正地用了這五個字把那位卓女士一筆勾消了。</p>
<p>『何以？只要她能寫文章就可以了。聽説她的詩還寫得滿可以。』</p>
<p>『現代所需要的文藝不單是血與涙的文藝。最重要的條件是力的條件。····』</p>
<p>耀星説得很起勁的樣子。</p>
<p>『·····你看卓女士是寫得出力的文藝來的人麽？她只是穿着跳舞的高跟鞋搖搖拽拽的，·····』</p>

<p>— 王雨梋</p>
<p>自一九二九年美國華爾街證劵交易所、大演混亂劇以後、美國經濟狀况、遂一落千丈、不可收拾、循至不景氣之現象、瀰漫及於全世界、迄今巳經過兩年半以上之長時期衰頽、其景象之深刻、爲歷來所未有、美國之經濟恐慌進行程度、據ＴheＡnnalist雜誌所列經濟景况指數、則一九二九年五月、曾達最高潮之一一○·一％、迨十二月卽突降爲九二·一％、自是以後、漸次降下、至一九三一年八月、爲七四·○　、蓋巳漸露恐慌之尖鋭化形態、且以物價復一般的下落、其中如棉花一項、一九三一年八月　、已自前年之一角二分跌至六分、小麥自八角五分、跌至五角美國銀行倒閉者、迄本年九月、計達一千二百十家之多</p>
<p>生産過剩失業增加、乃爲今日世界經濟不振之最主要原因、各國爲謀保護本國産業、及增加國家財政上之收入計、乃競相從事關税戰爭、高築税率之壁壘、藉以驅逐外來之經濟勢力、且間接足以豐裕國家之財政收入、此種非武力之戰爭行爲雖足以救濟一時之經濟衰頽、然舍本逐末、究非正圖也、</p>
<p>原經濟恐慌之所以發生、實以今日之世界經濟驟失其平衡、有以致之、故今日除保護關税政策外、同時與之崛起者、復有所謂統制經濟、以爲各國競採爲重要經濟政策、考統制經濟之實施方法、不外出於兩途、一曰管理匯兑、二曰管理貿易、前者在於調節本國貨弊、防範現金之流出國外、後者在限制不必要之外貨輸入以謀國際借貸之改善、此兩者在各國、有同時並施亦有祗限於一種者、要之其爲企圖救濟經濟恐慌、而回復於繁榮之途則一也、</p>
<p>近頃各國復有實行减　生産、以挽經濟頽勢之舉其最著者如古巴之糖其一九二九｜三○年度之産額爲四百六十七萬一千噸、聞於來年度起、更將减爲二百萬噸、又爪哇糖一九二九｜三○年度爲二百九十萬零三千噸來年度亦將减爲一百三十五萬噸云、</p>
<p>小麥亦屬世界重要商品之一年來以收穫頗佳致供給過剩市價大受影響、近各地巳羣起設法實行减産美國方面、本年之産額與上年之餘剩額三億二千萬蒲式耳併計、則得九億九千萬蒲式耳今後國内之消費額需七億五千萬蒲式耳、輸出額八千萬蒲式耳、結果明年度之餘剩額、爲一億六千萬蒲式耳、較之上年、適成半减狀態、坎拿大方面、據最後之預測、本年减收二千七百萬蒲式耳、澳洲小麥、據本年十一月十五日之電訊、約減收二千七百萬蒲式耳、羅馬尼亞本年之凈輸出額、預料將减少一千萬蒲式耳、又蘇俄本年預料將减産七億四千萬蒲式耳、</p>
<p>又本年棉産、據最近美國農商部發表、本年世界棉花收成將爲近九年來最少之年、蓋美國植棉畝數、旣鋭减於前、而埃及棉田停種者尤多、曾預定减少棉收百分之三十三、雖巴西·墨西哥·及下印度三處棉收、預估將達四百二十萬包、較前年增八十萬包、及中國波斯産棉、亦有增加、然估計全世界産額、僅有二千三百四十萬包、其中美國收成、將在一千一百萬至一一千二百萬包之間、查一九二三年、世界棉收爲一千九百十二萬五千包、翌年卽驟增至二千三百八十二萬五千包、嗣是過剩日積、棉價鋭落、今乃爲近九年第一次之鋭減狀况也、</p>
<p>糖麥棉三者、在世界商品中、處最重要之地位、其年産與消費數量之多寡、足以影響世界經濟之前途至鉅吾人根據上述種種情形、以主要産糖之古巴·爪哇·及産麥棉之美國澳洲等處、均能實施减産計畫、是有裨於世界經濟前途、實非淺鮮、使今後果能秉此方針、進步繼續前進、吾人可信未來之世界生産事業、其需求關係、或漸可脱離供給過剩、及需要不振之狀態、而回復於平衡之途、是其結果所獲寗不遠愈於彼謀一己福利之保護關税政策、從可知在今日陷於不景氣深淵而莫由振拔之經濟界、苟欲求眞正之解救、則非賴相互之恊力、與夫推誠相處之精神、以赴事功不可、否則倘任令長此以往恐彼以鄰國爲壑之經濟政策、將見各國爭相效尤、而世界經濟之總崩潰、亦必迫於眉睫間矣、</p>

<p>加之美埃兩國政府爲反對存棉超過市場政策起見、而減少種植地畝以補救之、除增加需要或收獲不豐外、此乃解决過量之供給及無利之巳減少十分之一、埃及減少則將及百分之二十矣、美國棉花迄至本季節止結存較前仍高、因之第一次棉産公開估計發表致使尙未全跌之棉價驟然上昇、迄至十月間棉産公開估計約一千一百四十二萬五千包、而一九三至三二年則實産一千七百零九萬六千包、至於埃及棉産量估計較之去年收成以一百二十八萬八千包減至八十六萬九千包如去年棉花消費速率在本年間尙能照舊維持則至現時季節止、美埃存棉、尙可減少數量雖然世界供給及可能之消費尙不能有所估計、棉價將低落至年初所發現之低小價格似無實現之可能也、然而在最近之將來除非美國及他處之植棉地畝再減而後因他種貨物致使大量存棉之價格切實固定增長處此情况之下棉花市况根本與羊毛不同、羊毛之採量業已適合市場所需要、并無如棉紗過量堆積於生産者之手、在棉産再有利於産棉者之前、而産棉者因人力所阻止之供給、行將有重大之負担、</p>

<p>世界經濟恐慌、方興未艾物價慘落、一瀉千里、而蘇俄所受之影響、似極微細、因近數年來、蘇俄物價、反見上騰、而農物之趨勢尤見鋒俏、蘇俄之物價、有所謂合作物價者係由當軸規定、出售數量、亦有限制、且僅售與享有該項購買　之人、此種物價、一九三一年中、　少變動、而自由市場之物價、則狂漲飛騰殊鑡　勁、合作物價、與自物價相差甚巨足覘蘇俄民間所需之殷且迫矣日用必需之品政府規定之供給不足則轉而向商人購買、價格稍昂、亦非所計、故一九三一年時、因必需品之缺乏、么商價格之增加、尤見迅速、而世界物價、力在傾瀉不己、則必需品之輸出似無可能、然揆諸實情、大謬不然、國内市場需給殊殷之要品、陸續出口、價格極低損失浩大、蓋所以支付進口貨値者、蘇俄之政府發言人Ｋaganovch并曾因不勝消費者之供給而言我人已建築之各大工廠、務繼續故我人之出口貿易、决不放鬆一步也此足以解釋蘇俄之態度當此世界不最氣之時各國貿易不振、而一九三一年蘇俄之出口貿易、反形大增者、亦卽以此、政府努力提倡、成本民生、兩非所計、所以有此畸形的發展也、</p>

<p>第一章　貨幣之起源</p>
<p>欲知貨幣之起源必先明貨幣之界説、今試稽之於韋勃斯忒大字典、則其釋貨幣一字之義曰任何事物、苟被用爲交易之媒介而又作爲價値之標準者胥爲貨幣、是以金也銀也范圍之圜也固爲貨幣卽皮也帛也貝也鹽也苟被用爲交易之媒介及價値之　準亦莫非貨幣也、且此等事物、在事實上亦固皆曾被各原始人民用作貨幣也、例如水獺之皮、在十八世紀中、尙被用爲貨幣而流行於美洲也</p>
<p>使用貨幣之事究於何時及何地首先行之、已莫可考、然　之幣最先流行於埃及與立地亞Ｌydia據最近之研究、則尙以立地亞爲先惟貨幣之使用固遠超出於　圜之先、故其初流行之眞相乃不可得而知之</p>
<p>惟其間有一事可以確知卽貨幣之發明並不屬於任何一民族之單獨行動是也、世界上之一切民族自野蠻生活中逐步演進而達理智發達之時期人事日繁慾望日增、貨物之使用日廣而交易爲勞、乃感及交易媒介及物價作標凖之重要爰卽發明貨幣而利用之、故貨幣之使用结爲一普遍这趨勢、初不能由任何民族獨擅其發明之功蓋亦就書契之發明及發展、固皆由各民族分别自得之也、</p>
<p>吾人對於貨幣起源之地點及時間、固皆不能審知、但關於其演進之趨勢則可以槪知、今先觀其問之主要事實、庶可借古以鑑今、於討論現世之貨幣問題時不致茫無頭緒也、</p>
<p>人類之基本需要爲衣食住三者彼固可以其一己之智力與體力與自然相爭、於自然之懷抱中取得其所需、以壓其慾、惟在此生産方式下、其所得率多寡陋又不適不給於用、彼苟能集中其精力於一事則其所得之結果必遠勝於前分顧各事時之所得惟此項專任一事之成立、必先有交易而後可、在分工與交易並行之經濟生活下、一人方能以其專産品與他人易取其他之必需品、以供生活之所需此種交易之最簡單者爲物物相易之直接形式是爲直接交換Ｂarter、惟直接交換之事祇能於最簡單之社會中行之、在複雜之社會中交易者人數衆多、其所交易之物亦至夥頤至此而直接交易之事乃有所窮、今欲推進其事、以利人生則必須發明一媒介物此物可交換任何貨物而又爲人人所欲得者有此物後、各人乃可專司一業、以其工作之結果易此大衆所欲之物、而後再以此物轉易其所需之一切生活用品在此情形下交易由直接轉至間接</p>
<p>此種用爲交媒介之通用貨物卽貨幣是也、任何貨物均可用爲貨幣在事實上其情形亦正合乎此吾國古代用貝用帛用日鹿之皮、亞慈忒之人民用椰子美洲初期之殖民用烟葉有數印度族則用煤塊並加雕飾以增美觀</p>
<p>有數種物品、因其品質之開係、尤爲人所欲得、如麵包及鹽是也、一人擁有一斧、以之易鹽而藏之在初交易之時彼或無需用鹽、惟彼見及此鹽將來可以易得其所需之任何他物故對之發生需要而亟欲易得珍藏之是以鹽之一物其所以爲人欲得者不僅以其可供食用且以其可在任何時間易得任何他種貨物也在此情形下、鹽卽爲貨幣推之於其他事物亦莫不然此等成爲貨幣之貨物咸具相當之特質（一）其量必較少、但亦不過分稀少（二）其體必可分、以供各種數不同之交易之用、（三）其體必輕而惠舉、可以運轉而無散失之虞（四）其質必固、可經久而不漬、鹽米貝帛等物固皆具此等品質者也、此種標凖按之現代理想貨幣之條件適正相合、斯亦可見古人思想之縝密矣、</p>
<p>其後貿易所用之幣品逐步減少而貨幣之選擇乃不復爲有思考及意識者矣其選擇乃出於一緩進之嘗試過程以最爲人所歡迎之物用作貨幣其間貨幣乃有一新重要品質出現卽須能滿足人類之裝飾慾望是任何事物苟能供人之裝飾、卽爲最佳之貿易媒介品珍寳亦猶貨幣經久不變、稀少而價値甚高、而又不過於笨重故亦常被用作貨幣堆之如無　飾錢釧物亦然、蓋皆曾廣被用作貨幣也</p>
<p>貨幣通行後價格卽隨之而興當未有貨幣之時、所謂價格者祗　用以易　他物之一物數量而巳自直接交易之事實而貨幣之使用代興後、貨物之價格始以貨幣爲度量、是以經濟學者常曰貨幣者交易之媒介而又爲價格之標準也、除此之外、貨幣尙有一機能卽彼以爲價値之貯積量是也、旣有貨幣後吾人乃無須將所有之物善積而藏之、待需要他物時再出售以易取之矣吾人可先將所有之物售出、易錢以貯藏之、而後再以此錢購取任何需要之物也、</p>
<p>交易旣繁、貿易斯與、然貿易之處理、未必定於一時完成之有時因種種之關係價格之支付恒於日後行之、於是在當時必先規定此價格之支付將以何物爲之、至於其數量若士其品質又將若何均須先有約定而後可、凡此諸點、貨幣均能善藏其事是以貨幣有一第四用途卽彼可用爲延期支付之標凖是也</p>
<p>要而言之自貨幣之使用發明後分工成爲可能、人民乃可專事一業以養成專門之高深技能而爲日後高等工業上之先河人民又可以貨幣測定一己産物之價格、以與其他各物相較而定其交易之標準、彼更可積儲貨幣、隨時隨地、以之易成其所需之任何事物、此外彼又可以爲之延期之支付及收入以便利商務之進行、總而言之、自有貨幣後、人瀕乃能造成今日之偉大商務活動與經濟文明、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c169">談時間 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>無事可談，且來談談時間，</p>
<p>許多人説，中國人不守時間，這可大錯特錯，中國人珍貴時間，代有名言，大禹惜寸，陶侃的惜分，都可爲之佐證，</p>
<p>譬如有某團體或某專家會議請你參加，時間規定是下午一時，那末你起碼好在家挨到一點半才穿起中山裝動身，走進會塲，脱下帽子，交給聽差，然後一個個握手道好，最後才慢呑呑的説，「剛才到那裏去拜會那一位黨國要人，談了許多救國大計，實在忙不過來，···」於是定有許多在座的同志，暗爲納罕，甚恭而敬之，這樣的一次二次，那末你在無形中便會身價百倍了，因爲只有要人在時間上才會忙不過來的，</p>
<p>至於有誰請你吃酒，你更可遲到起碼兩個鐘頭，因爲你按時間去，主人的聽差也會懐疑你三天没有吃飯，所以世情練達的常是有意遲到，而且最好是吃一兩著菜便宣告退席，情願回去吃開水泡飯，這樣才不致於有傷大雅，</p>
<p>這樣看來，中國人不守時間，自有道理，難道還可以和外國人一樣任意侮蔑嗎？</p>
<p>夫時間者，乃週轉不息之物也，今天過了還有明天，所以今天幹不了的事，正可留待明天，今天不想幹的事，更可以以後再想方法，人生精力有限人何必精勵勵呢？所外國人把時間看得太重，耗盡精力，究竟不免傻瓜，</p>
<p>至於玩弄時間，正是我國同胞的特長，豈可抺煞，例如日軍佔領東北，我們不必馬上興兵救國，不妨不急不忙的訴諸國聯，不妨退後一百步想而長期抵抗、而所謂長期當然是一直長下去以至於無期，萬一日軍今天再佔領上海，我們不妨等明天連同關防印壐退到潼關，假如明天再佔領洛陽，那末可於後天退到外蒙古的大戈壁了，</p>
<p>中日爭議，固然可靜候國聯解决，至於國聯要來瓜分中國，那末還可再設水陸道塲，虔敬上蒼，靜候玉皇大帝來主持公道了，</p>
<p>明日復明日，明日何其多，人生不滿百，何不再磋砣？這是我的結語，</p>

<p>— 爾明</p>
<p>普通由甘蔗或甜菜所得之粗糖，常含有灰分，及轉化糖等，故多用骨炭精製之，所得之糖即精糖，精糖色白，其品質較由甘蔗或甜菜製出者爲優，故略述其製法之梗槪，</p>
<p>原料糖之品位原料糖即粗糖之品位，視其色及所含之水，蔗糖，葡萄糖，無機物等而定，色之淡者，當精製時可以節省骨灰之消費量，含葡萄糖無機物等多者，則减少精糖之得率，精糖之得率爲由迴旋度所算得之蔗糖％數中，减去五倍量之無機物（灰分）％數，與一倍量之葡萄％數後所餘之％數（按得率可以任意規定之例如在德國對於甜菜糖之得率則定爲由蔗糖％數减去五倍量之轉化糖％數者是）普通得率爲九五％以上之粗糖，爲優良之原料，近來用預備處理法，巳能增高劣等糖之品位，使適於精糖之製造也，原料糖之結昌宜均一，以不含細粒爲佳，又糖蜜之附着量，亦以愈少爲愈妙，</p>
<p>帶有濕性之糖常多少含有轉化糖，故若用全不含轉化糖之甜菜糖爲原料，而製造此種砂糖時，通常多混用適量之甘蔗糖，又甜菜糖多帶鹼性，而甘蔗糖則帶酸性，故製造精糖時，亦有將其依適當之量配合，而使其互相中和者，要之原料糖之配合實爲製糖上最重要工程之一也，</p>
<p>原料糖之預備處理法原料糖常先用機械的方法，行預備處理，以除去大部分之沔物，法於原料糖中混加濃厚糖水後，乃用分蜜機以分其蜜，此際常施以撒布冷水或濃厚糖水等之補助工作，然亦有自分蜜機之中心吹入蒸汽者，如此則分蜜更爲完全，</p>

<p>溶解及淸潔經預備處理法後之原糖，乃置於溶解釜中溶解之，釜爲鐵製方開放圓筒，有各種直徑，深約四英尺至五英尺，可容含有砂糖三噸至十噸之溶液，其中央部有虚底，虚底之下備有四條蒸汽螺旋管，注水於釜中，使適淹没蒸氣管，乃通蒸汽，加適量之熱，次加水與砂糖於虚底之上，迴轉攪拌置設於虚底之下，以促進砂糖之溶解，又其右方與别室相交界之處，裝有黄銅製之網篩，所溶解之糖液，由此通過流出，因以除去粗大之夾雜物，而防其同赴濾過器，所得糖液即行濾過，或使在溶解釜或其他之淸凈器略爲淸凈後，乃濾過金屬製網篩，以除其一部分之夾雜物，次更以濾器濾之，淸凈劑多使用石灰，或同時更加燐酸若干，此外亦有使用硫酸鋁與石灰者，</p>
<p>脱色旣經濾過之糖液，尙多少着色，故須再將其通過骨灰濾器，使之脱色，骨灰濾器爲塡充有骨灰之大圓桶，因骨灰有特殊之吸取作用，故得除去色質，器由鑄鐵或鍊鐵製成，其大小不一，如直徑十呎，高二十呎爲其一例，由上部之口，裝入骨灰，堆積於敷於虚底之布上，由管子壓入溫糖液經過骨灰層，溢至一接收器内，緊閉而放置三十或二十小時後，然後使之流出，迨骨灰之脱色力减少，乃送入溫水而充分洗滌之，所得之稀薄洗滌液可供原料糖之溶解用，或蒸發之以製劣等砂糖，潮濕之骨灰由下方側部之口取出，適宜灼熱之　仍可反覆使用，此種操作稱爲骨灰之再生，</p>
<p>蒸發　旣經脱色後之糖液，乃蒸發濃縮之，通用者爲眞空蒸發法，即在低壓之下，以蒸發糖液也，用此法能使糖液在攝氏五十度前後即行沸騰蒸發，故旣無過熱之虞，而亦不至惹起蔗糖轉化，加以蒸發迅速，蒸汽之消費最少，甚屬有利，尤以如連結數個之眞空蒸發器，用第一蒸發器所生之蒸汽，加熱第二蒸發器之糖液，更將其所生之蒸汽用以蒸發第三蒸發器之糖液之裝置，更爲經濟，此種裝置稱爲多效用蒸發裝置，故爲現今使用最廣者也，</p>
<p>煎糖及結晶　經蒸發後之糖液，仍含有多量水分，故尙須蒸發濃縮之，使其含水分僅達十％左右，此稱爲煎糖法，行煎糖法後乃更行結昌法，此二操作在現今大工塲，皆併行於一個眞空結晶器中，眞空結晶器爲鑄鐵製之低圓筒，内部備有數段蒸汽螺旋管以加熱於糖液，先運轉唧筒以減少器中壓力，然後注入濃厚糖液，至完全掩蔽最下段之螺旋管爲止，乃通入蒸汽於螺旋管，漸次添加糖液，因其增加，而上部之蛇管亦通以蒸汽，至糖液達適當之濃渡時，則急添加新糖液，或增高其眞空度，且限制蒸汽之供給，使内部之糖液溫度稍降，因此糖液中生成微細之結晶母，此爲結晶糖之種子，更加濃厚糖液而通蒸汽，繼續煎糖使該結晶長成，迨結晶旣滿，乃停止注加糖液及通入蒸汽　而開放器底，取出即爲結晶糖槳也，</p>
<p>分蜜　巳冷郤之結晶糖槳爲附有母液（即糖蜜）之結晶砂糖，故不可不分離之，此事稱爲分蜜法，行分蜜時常使用分蜜機，先徐徐迴轉分蜜機，加結晶糖漿於篩後，乃以每分鐘約迴轉一千至一千五百次之速度迴轉之，則糖蜜通篩孔而出外圓筒，精糖則殘留於篩之内面，若欲使其更爲純白，可於分蜜時用含有少量羣靑之水洗滌之，</p>
<p>乾燥　經分蜜後之精糖，可散布於地板上使之冷郤乾燥，若欲得允分乾燥物時，則可行天日乾燥或使用乾燥器乾燥之，</p>

<p>— 還吾</p>
<p>這時候，纔在黄昏靜後，在這一條素稱僻靜的馬路上，閃着那慘綠地路燈的光彩，只有被西風打下來的，這馬路兩旁的樹上的敗葉，偶然因微風的吹動，在地上沙沙地發響，打破這死般的沉寂地空氣。</p>
<p>一個剛才今天出獄的竊犯，他好似覺得没有顔面可給和他同類的人們去看，因爲他自己已是傷失了道德的人，并且他知自己已是傷失了這德的人，并且他也無家可歸，很想離開人羣，但是終究是逃不出這個世界，還是走到這條僻靜的馬路裏來，使自己得舒適地呼吸幾下空氣。</p>
<p>他在三個月以前，他的老母害病埀危的時候，犯了竊案，被治安地方的巡捕去捉，拘禁在牢獄中的。雖然今天他已經罪滿出獄，然而他可不還是個没工可做，無地啗飯的失業者；不過他現在連棲身之所都没了。高大的房屋，在這人類所有的土地上建築着的，雖然很多，可不曾收留過没錢的人去住。</p>
<p>他尙在靑年，這黯敗的面色，似是他已頽廢到極點。破舊的布袍外面，圍着一根草繩，聳着肩膀，執着一根不知從何處檢拾得來的精笨的木棒，垂頭喪氣地，在這僻靜的馬路裏，他踽踽地行着。</p>
<p>迎面走來一個幼童口裏唱着吚吚唔唔的不成調的歌曲，連聳帶跳地走着，情景好似很快樂。在他心緒正在惡劣的當兒，他簡直很有點妒嫉人家的快樂，向這幼童怒視了一眼，瞥見路燈照到幼童在微微揮動着的手上，中指戴着一枚細似線條的金戒，他立即替自己明天的生活計算起來。</p>
<p>「這不是個極好的機會！」他的心裏在敱催着自己。</p>
<p>「這東西雖然小，終値得幾個錢吧！」他經了這一想，就不慌不忙的把幼童攔住了去路。</p>
<p>「怎不讀我走啊？」</p>
<p>「把你這金戒脱下來，給我！」他頓時機成了像囚猙的惡魔，向幼童厲聲地喝説。</p>
<p>「這···這是我的···東西！」幼童有點害怕起來。</p>
<p>「你敢無禮，你敢不服氣｜你是個幼弱的孩子罷了。」</p>
<p>他便把幼童扯住，動手强將幼童指上的金戒搶了過來。他一放手，嚇得那幼童掉轉身就哭着飛奔回去。</p>
<p>他聽幼童的哭聲漸漸遠去了，在電桿木旁，路燈下立停了，借着燈光，望着掌中的金戒出神。這眩目的黄金光澤，他見了眞有點得意。</p>
<p>忽然使他打了一個寒噤，心中感觸到了什麽般的，就追上前去，爲了他天良陡發而悔悟了。</p>
<p>他非常的窘急；向前奔了許多路，却除了自己，不見第二個人影。得從那裏去找到這幼童，將這金戒送還呢？他只得大聲地呼喊起來：</p>
<p>「小把戲！我和你閙玩啊，你來啊！」</p>
<p>他這般高呼了幾回以後，但是没有答應的，禁不住就掩面痛泣起來。這敢是他有生以來，第一次遭到的悲痛事了。　　可是他還是繼續向前找尋過去，見前面有一個人影在活動，他立即飛奔上去看時，却是一個和他在同、階級的小乞。</p>
<p>「我有一件東西送你。」他急忙向這小乞説，説時就把金戒塞在小乞的手裏，他和那幼童被他搶刦金戒時一般地恐嚇的，掉轉身飛奔逃去了。</p>

<p>「擬答」一般店員工友或學徒，都是受僱於人的，除掉忠於職務外，其他的一切動作，都足以遭經理和主管者嫉視。雖然幹抗日救國的工作，他們也奈何你不得；但是往往容易假借着旁的問題，來使你受到很苛刻的處分。周君所提的問題，實爲目下急切須解决的重大問題。現將拙見所及，寫在後面。</p>
<p>一、智識階級的店員們：可以藉着業餘之暇，多作抗日救國宣傳文字，寄稿於有關係之救國團體，充作宣傳的資料。</p>
<p>二、收益較豐的店員們：可以節省一切無謂之消耗，捐充救國經費。</p>
<p>三、無論店員，工友，學徒：均須隨時秘密監視各該店内有否「私進仇貨」及「改頭換面混充國貨」等事。一有發現，可以隠名報告於有關係的救國團體，俾便澈底查究；但須嚴守秘密，以免麵包問題發生危險。</p>

<p>但是我們在可能底範圍内，一可以盡中華民國一份子的義務，幹抗日救國的工作「正多着啦。例如：」日用器具：盡購國貨。吃的，穿的，不購仇貨；尤不可販賣仇貨，」每於公餘之暇，去遊遊戲塲，吸烟，飲酒等浪費：不妨按月抽個十分之幾去捐助東北抗日的健兒。若遇到了你的朋友，同鄕，親戚，或那缺少知識者：不妨以口頭宣傳倭奴的種種慘無人道的惡劣行爲！俾我同胞，人人心窩中都深刻了一個「東洋老我仇敵」的印象｜凡此種種，皆屬輕而易舉，於個人并無損失，具有愛國心的同志們，當無不表同情的。商界中人，如個個都能這樣實行起來，斷無不收成效的｜同時，我們「可以盡中華民國一份子的義務，幹抗日救國的工作」了。</p>
<p>十二月五日胡勉儂謹上</p>
<p>不必高談抗日，必須切實救國。然救國先要救地方：救地方先要救自家；救自家先要救自身。自身的學問能力，當得這樣重大的責任嗎？否則，務須補救自己的學問能力。自己家裏被經濟壓迫得不能翻身，你覺得父母妻子的痛苦嗎？否則，你先須挑開自家的壓迫，使你的父母妻子得到生活上相當的需要。　　再看看自己村上窮苦同胞很多很多，你怎樣輔助他們跑向歡樂之途呢？總之：立志不要太高，不要太遠，揀我能力辦得到的盡力做去，這便是眞正的救國之道。夫如是，則日不抗而巳抗矣！　　　　姚狂生答</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>雨雖然像倒一般的大，但是有雨帽，雨衣，還有出差的汽車好喚，我是不須淋一點雨的便從公庽到了你們所住的平安里的弄口。心和煑沸了的水一般地跳着，很遲緩的下了車。那時弄口烟纸店裏的壁鐘，正打着十二下。九月十主日的正午。</p>
<p>旣然决心要走了，爲什麽又冒着雨，趕過來呢？目的不用説，自然是想再在你們家裏吃一餐飯，｜吃一餐最後的飯，藉此和你作個永訣。</p>
<p>提起「永訣」，我又忍不住要發表一些深刻得足以自己氣死自己的話了。打開天窗説亮話：在三角戀愛的戰場上，當其中的一個，突然表示要忍痛割愛，而走向所愛的目標那裏去ＳayＣoodＢye的時候，與其説他是去作「永訣」，還不如説他是在孤注一擲，破釜沉舟的作殊死戰；他决不是誠心準備犧牲，决不是消極，他還是在掙扎，還是在搏戰。他不過想變一個方法用「死」，或「出走」做要挾，而從他的情敵的手中，把所愛的奪過來！</p>
<p>我那時候的心裏，不必抵賴，的確也是如此啊！</p>
<p>「朱伯伯······咦······朱伯伯······哈哈哈····！」但是、便宜了周大經。當我的身子才跳進弄堂，就發現了一道比鐵絲網沙袋還堅固的阻欄：那是什麽，那是你的可愛的「小薔薇」。他在吳媽的懐抱裏，撑着一頂紙傘，毫無目的地在欣賞着雨聲和人聲的合奏，她跟往常一樣地見了我，就張開小嘴，大笑起來了。同時，伸着兩支白得像玉刻一樣的小臂，不住地向我招手。　　她眞像小天使一樣的可愛，我發狂似的在大雨裏猛吻着她的小頰。</p>
<p>「伯····伯····來·····姆媽····好！」這兩句我所聽慣了朱成文的短句，從她兩爿跟紅玫瑰一般鮮艶的嘴唇裏輕吐將出來；一遇空氣，立刻變了Ｘ燈所發的電光，不容我有逃遁的餘地，便赤裸裸的照出了我所懷的一片獰惡的心理了。</p>
<p>「要如事實眞像幻想一般的美滿，你果然從大經的家裏跳了出來，隨着我走了，那末這「小薔薇」不是馬上要變爲一個「無母之兒」了嗎？她將如何悲傷？如何可憐？·····」思想突然轉了一個方向，趨重到了道德的觀念上去。</p>
<p>我握着「小薔薇」的小手的一條臂膀，像觸電似的震着。也不知道打那裏來的熱淚，竟從眼眶裏跳了出來，一點一點地滴在她那金絲似的秀髮上。</p>
<p>「朱伯·····伯·····哈哈····囝囝要！」她的意思是要我一同進去。　　她戰勝了！緊張而尖鋭的空氣，壓迫着我後退。我像發狂一般地擲掉了我的雨帽，撕下了我的雨衣，忘了一切的衝進了每一點滴，都像核桃一般大的雨陣中去。不知道經過了多少時候，走過了些什地方，我終於給雨水裝點成一頭浸透的落湯鷄，高踞在霞飛路的一家俄羅斯菜館裏大喝其冰淇淋了。</p>
<p>提起喝冰淇淋，我又想起今年夏天，和你在高橋海濱搶喝冰淇淋的一幕値得回味的舊影來了。</p>
<p>那一天，不知換了什麽風向，你們那一位頭腦冷靜，暮氣沉沉的朱大律師，突然心血來潮，竟首先很有勁地發起要上高橋海濱浴場去；這一個提議，當然我是最熱烈的贊成人。不料接着他又發了一道命令，責成你在家裏看守小薔薇；他這一句話才出口，我已經失望得像被判無期徒刑似的難受了。但是，美麗的小猪攞，我不是一個有名的富於急智的脚色嗎？富於急智的脚色，是永遠不會受窘的。我那時候一壁在失望，一壁已在籌畫着怎樣半途脱逃的策略了；｜半途脱逃之於我，正是生平第一拿手好戲。｜幸而旁邊還有兩位善於凑趣的脚色，早用一種强奸式的手段，撤回了大經的命令，擁着你走出大門去了</p>

<p>— 翊烈</p>
<p>錄MyTripAbroad（我的海外旅行）</p>
<p>一九三一年的時候，卓别麟從好萊塢回到倫敦，在最初三天之中，接收各方的歡迎信件總數有七萬三千多封，平均每小時一千一百十一封，爲了堆積如山的信，卓别麟請了半打臨時書記來拆信。</p>
<p>這許多信當中，有二萬八千多封是請求佈施的。信中要求的欵項的數目，從四毛錢到四萬元。</p>
<p>依據了這許多信的説明，卓别麟在英國境内有六百八十對爺娘。并且現在都是健在，寫信給他的人説，都是從兄弟。有寄下極其詳細的家系圖做爲證明　　許多要求佈施信中，有一封這樣寫的：</p>
<p>「卓别麟先生！這封信裏放着我祖母的金牙齒和銀水壺的當票，你看看那當票的期限就可知道昨天已經滿期了。所以請你替我轉當，只要給了利錢，便可改起當的日期了，拜託拜託｜這麽一來，我祖母的口裏，便有歡迎那金牙齒回頭的一天了，我們自從父親要買啤酒當掉銀壺以來，實不便在鄰居跟前出頭露面呀！小朋友上」</p>
<p>還有幾封最有趣的，錄在下面；</p>
<p>「鄙人對於卓别麟先生，表示衷心歡迎的誠意，茲訂於九月十一日的星期日，遇着方便的時候，前來替先生剃鬍子，ＸＸ生謹啓」。</p>
<p>又一封是這樣的；</p>
<p>「値得羨慕欽佩的卓别麟先生哟，閣下如果有那穿舊的皮鞋，請割愛送我一雙，我願意拿金鐲和你對換呢」。</p>
<p>在巴黎，有一家影戲院請他在影戲券上簽字，因爲凡是簽過字的，每張可售一百法郎，而且還「供不應求」。</p>

<p>— 星</p>
<p>光陸的銀幕上，熱鬧了好幾天，許多大明星合演的『無線電大集會』以後；從昨天起，又換了一張（ＯnceＩceＡＬlfeＴime）『破天荒』·據説也是不少名角合演的佳作·所以光陸門前，也和前幾天一樣的熱鬧了！</p>
<p>這本事，是很着名的劇本映成的·牠述一個幸福兒，本來是舞台上的優伶·因正値有聲片勃興，于是約了兩個同事，投到好萊塢去幾番波折，竟會得了意外的成功；從此直上靑雲，名利雙收·</p>
<p>以牠的劇情説，的確用原名『影林幸福』好些·光陸用空虚的『破天荒』來作片名廣告，當然容易吸引人些·不過離本題太遠了。</p>
<p>在資産國家出品的影片中，是免不了有階級色彩在内。所以美國片，｜特别是帶滑稽性的，｜不會有例外；這片就走了這條現成的軌道。命運之神，把一個一無所能的幸兒，造成一個大人物。博經濟社會中觀衆的一笑。這也是美國人，常存僥倖之心的明白表現。</p>

<p>霍華特休士是好萊塢一個鉅富的製片家，現在打算到美國航空公司去服務，當他到公司裏去報考的時候，他改名呌却爾司霍華特ＣharlesＷＨaward，他的考試己完全及格了，公司方面己准許給他一個飛機師的位置，將來他還打算用他在天空的經歷，寫成一篇劇本，攝製一張航空片，</p>

<p>在這所謂的笑片中，所有笑料都</p>
<p>隠藏在對白和小動作中。整個的説，牠只是一幕喜劇而巳不過導演ＲussellＭack，用他的聰明，很努力于諷剌工作。描寫世態炎凉，和一種狼假虎威的卑劣動作。我以爲；不要以爲那是可笑的，那是可悲的在現今社會中，處處可以看見，不過我們平常不留心，而且看不見具體的事實而巳！</p>
<p>鏡頭用得巧妙得很。光綫也不錯。一起一收，都非常有力。全片組織和表演，都極好。小穿挿很多，用的地方也合適。增加不少興趣。</p>

<p>— 陳征帆</p>
<p>不守公共秩序｜｜這是我們貴國人民的一椿美德。别的且不談，單是那電影院賣票處前面，一般人士横衝直撞，排山倒海，揮拳揎袖，拚命搶先的光景，也就很夠瞧的了！民族文化程度的落後如此，眞令人爲之太息不置！</p>
<p>「小的」没曾到過外國，所以不敢侈談外國的情形。今年暑假裏邊，我遊歷北方，客居天津一個月，在華燈初上的傍晚，時常到光陸大戲院看電影。那兒門口的賣票處，高懸木牌一只，上面寫着「請排成行列」（Ｐleaselineup）的字樣，一切買票的人們（中國人外國人都有），都得依着先後，排成一字長蛇陣，按着次序地，一個一個地進前買票，絶對没有互相擁擠，爭前恐後的形狀，其結果，在辦事人方面旣然精神爽利，於是僅需要一會兒的工夫，大家便都能把票買好了。</p>
<p>上海一切大小電影院的老闆們，爲了使得你們自己的職員們辦事方便起見，爲了養成國人的遵守公共秩序的習慣起見，可否請你們也照樣地實行一下呢</p>
<p>明星軼事</p>
<h3 id="c181">雷門伐羅的發跡（上） <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 希孟</p>
<p>在距今十四年以前，雷門諾伐羅猶是一個十九歲的郸了，他從墨西哥的多浪谷，越境入美，去試試他的命運。他到美國去的時候，除了靑春與强健之外不完全的英語；旣没有錢，亦没有朋友。但他不顧一切的，來到美國。那時美國同墨西哥的戰事，告終不久，兩國的人民，各懷忌恨，互相仇視，所以雷門諾伐羅的離墨去美，他的家屬雖極反對，而担憂的。雷門到美國的時候，以美國人的勢利眼光看來，不過平常的一個移民而己。</p>
<p>但雷門係很古怪的人，他是慣在逆境與憂患之中討生活的。你倘使告訴他，那件事是他辦不了的，他聽了你的話，就會做給你看，證明你的錯誤。他對於這種方法，與人們抵獨著他相信是得天助的，這種勇敢，當然帮助他了他的成功。</p>
<p>在那個時候，影星們的薪水，還不及現在的大，但他曾經説過：「如果别的演員，可以每星期賺一千塊錢，我亦可以賺一千塊錢一個星期」。那個時候，他所賺的，大槪祗有每星期一千個銅板吧，因爲他剛剛得到一些事做。</p>
<p>雷門到了美國之後，曾經加入過瑪琳穆根的歌舞團，而在没有事做的時候，他变必定尋些事情做做。那時他還没有一定的目的，但他自己相信自己，將來一定能成功的。</p>
<p>國片預告</p>
<h3 id="c182">戰事影片與「孤軍」 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 聊齋</p>
<p>在無聲片犯着猩紅熱症的時期，銀幕上的戰事影片似乎被「戰地之花」佔了首席，等有聲片突起，這光榮似乎又轉被「西線無戰事」佔去了，科學化的慘殺，在電光泡影裏，還是有攫取影迷者心靈的可能，最近的國産電影界，也傳染着了這駭人的險症，不過事實的證明，較諸舶來，總有絶大的差别，難怪，這是物質，科學，以及技能，曁一切的不足，也許若干年後可得到相等的成績，在國産電影界的最近，有幾位負有盛名的工作人員，他們合資創辦一家影片公司，集中了各種人材，用極取巧，極偉大的思想，拍攝一張軍事影片，這影片的名稱呌做「孤軍」</p>
<p>「孤軍」的劇旨，是包括「忠勇孝義」的，以戰場爲背景，以戰地的秘密工作爲中心，再用愛情來襯托孝義，導演這本戲的陳天，本人就是一個曾經主持戰期内秘密工作的幹員，劇情的實况，就是他本人經歷的寫眞，比慘殺更慘，比肉搏更險，但是你見不到一些殘忍的影了，</p>
<p>在聯華的「人道」出映之後，影迷的觀衆似乎巳感到欣賞上的慾望，「孤軍」的出世，也許更會使你滿足，現在聽説該片已攝製過半，軍事部份是由某軍隊助演的，實際上比假扮的眞確些，</p>
<p>我們渴望國産電影有較好的戰事影片産生，我們希「孤軍」有較好的成績映出，我們在這引頸而望之呢，</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>
<h3 id="c183">咱們的小生 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 湯神</p>
<p>近年來，中國的電影，據説是復興了！</p>
<p>武俠派的火燒XX寺大破XXX總算在市上絶了跡，而這新興的代替的是蝴蝶派的電影。雖有人在竭力提倡着爲大衆，爲民族，事實上總少見，有也牽强。</p>
<p>事實上是輪到蝴蝶派；小生的地位，也不由不重要起來。</p>
<p>「小生」使男人艶羨的小生，使女人迷醉的小生；你們是在電影復興的途中也是先鋒，所希望你們勿酖於酒色，努力建設起中國影界的基礎。憑你們好好的努力，無欵的，在最近的將來，會使這沉寂的小生界放出燦爛的光輝來！</p>
<p>下面的一些小生，我認爲在電影界尙有些地位；對我皆無一面之緣，僅從銀幕上的印象，寫我零星的感想而已。</p>
<p>金燄：他早先在南國劇社，代替了陳凝秋的地位，在舞臺上早享了盛名；那時的缺點，是一對勞傷眼；可是到了銀幕，一對微睜的秋水（？）倒更使娘兒們迷醉起來了。最近，他晋陞了皇帝的寳位。他具有一付强健的身體，表情也很能夠發揮，實際上，他的成名並不是爲此，還是好的導演的劇本，好的配角，使他這樣的。</p>
<p>鄭君里：他起初在銀幕上發現是在野玟瑰片裡。後來，經孫瑜氏的識拔，他是做了火山情血的主角，最近又做奮鬥的主角。二者。都得了好評。</p>
<p>朱飛：他的專長，就是表演懦弱感傷的男子。他在銀幕上的歷史很長，自從明星新開張，他就起始擔任小生，中間祇有幾次退伍；没有安定的職位。自從去年在北邊坐了一次牢，現在就不聽見他響哪！我希望他要及時努力重登影臺。</p>
<p>鄭小秋：我曾聽見一般老太太們説他好，但我總想不到他好在那一點，瑩和我説：「他那白白胖胖的樣子，誠誠懇懇呆呆的態度，不是老太太們心頭所愛的兒子麽？」我的感覺到鄭小秋的漂亮，似乎已離開了時代。</p>
<p>龔稼穠：他額間的縐紋，不無表示美人遲暮之感；然而，他的表情很好。假如，有好的劇本，便他做一個三十歲左右的人他的成績，必有可觀，看過歌女紅牡丹和啼笑历緣必定以爲我的話不錯。</p>
<p>孫敏：這傢伙有人説他是剃頭師傅，或許是因他穿上洋裝時，頭常上伸縮的原故吧！漂亮不敢恭維，身材不過却很適中，若能把臉部表情多了研究，舉動上脱離了文明戲的色彩，也可做一個很好的小生。</p>
<p>馬陋芬：一匹馬，陋則陋矣，徧有芬芳，不亦奇乎？馬先生請不要氣，你的催眠曲譜，不是很盛行麽？你還是丢開塗油彩的功夫，而專幹音樂這玩意兒罷。</p>
<p>高占非：他主演的「粉紅色的夢「南國之春」「共赴國難」和金燄幾可並肩而立。他遜於金燄的，是不能澈底知道劇情的意義，所以有時面部表情就不行了。</p>
<p>陳一棠：二十一二歲下腮瘦削的小夥子，祗拜過他一張片子，不敢斷定，陳秋風王春元那我就不知道了。</p>

<p>Japanese Side Compensates for Losses from Bombardment, Japanese Armored Vehicles Depart Yuguan Station Separately</p>
<p>In addition to actively arranging military matters against the 熱河 border in areas such as Beiyingzi and Nanling on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang railway line, the Japanese army in Beiping suddenly increased its garrison in Suizhong by 500 troops yesterday. They are also using Cheng Guorui, a remnant of the former Zhili-Lu Allied Army, as the commander-in-chief of the bogus National Salvation Army, gathering scattered soldiers and vagrants along the Liugu River to attack Lingyuan. Cheng has already begun organizing the bogus troops in Suizhong, and all actions are under the command of the Japanese. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Beiping, both sides have reached an appropriate compromise regarding the Yuguan Incident. The Japanese side will compensate for our losses from the bombardment. One Japanese armored vehicle will head to Qiansuo, one to Jinzhou, and one out of Yuguan. Police are maintaining order at Yuguan Station, and traffic is gradually returning to normal. Martial law remained in effect in Yuguan City on the evening of the 10th. He Zhuguo has not slept for three days. Merchants and residents are making and delivering tea and meals to the soldiers, willing to defend Yuguan City and share life and death with the troops. Order at the station is gradually being restored. The Japanese side has a garrison team, the Kwantung Army's 8th Division Military Police Corps, Japanese police, and bogus police at the station, making the situation very complex. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>While the Yuguan Incident in Beiping was at its most serious, righteous armies outside the Guan rose up like bees. On the morning of the 10th, a unit of the righteous army attacked Gaoling Station but was repelled by the Japanese army. The bogus Fengshan Railway train stopped at Qiansuo for three hours last night, reportedly to avoid a Japanese armored vehicle returning to Qiansuo. Farmers in Harbin, Bu Kui, and Anda are fleeing into the Guan in droves, unable to withstand the Japanese army's oppression. Approximately 6,000 people have returned to their ancestral homes in Shandong and Henan from the four passes on the bogus Fengshan Railway in recent days. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After the resolution of the bombardment of Yuguan and the Yuguan Incident, the local situation completely returned to normal on the 11th. At 11:00 AM, seven Japanese planes flew in formation from outside the Guan, divided into three groups and circled Yuguan City for half an hour before flying east. Yuguan and Qinhuangdao are both peaceful and uneventful. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>A telephone report from Beiping and Chengde states that the areas along the 熱河 border, such as Chaoyang, Dongliulongtai Pass, and Beiyingzi, are quiet. Our Dong brigade is still stationed at its original defenses. There are no incidents on the Kailu border; only disguised Koreans are entering the territory for reconnaissance. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After inspecting the defenses on the 熱河 border, Meng Zhaotian of Beiping will return to Beiping within a few days to report to Zhang. It has been decided that the bogus state will divide the Hulunbuir area and the area west of the Hinggan Mountains and Outer Northeast into a new "Hinggan Province." The bogus governor will be Ding Guishan, the son of Guifu. The bogus garrison commander will likely be Bao Weixin. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>

They engaged in fierce fighting with 700 Japanese soldiers for several hours in the evening. The Japanese army brought in three armored vehicles, and more than 500 reinforcements launched a general attack on our forces. Our army adopted an encirclement strategy and fiercely attacked for two hours. The Japanese army could not withstand it and retreated to the city walls to defend. Our troops occupied Xinmin Station, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Anti-Russian Warfare is in Progress</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Moscow, 11th - Unconfirmed reports received here indicate that serious political disturbances have occurred in Outer Mongolia. Members of the National Radical Party have seized the Kulun government. Although their leader is a graduate of the Soviet Army University, this action is by no means a pro-Russian movement. It is reported that a person named Jin Wang (transliteration), who comes from Mongolian nobility and studied at the Moscow Army University and interned at the Soviet General Staff Department, returned to Mongolia this spring. However, his political views are incompatible with the Soviet government. He has now seized the Kulun regime, but other parties have also organized powerful troops to fight against him. They are currently engaged in a war to seize Kulun. Soviet Russian border officials have been trying to ascertain the truth.</p>

<p>Czechoslovakia, Spain, and Switzerland Express Fair Judgments and Just Claims</p>
<p>Hopes That Britain Will Carefully Consider Its Attitude in the League of Nations</p>
<p>Nanjing - A Central News Agency reporter interviewed a certain government official yesterday regarding the attitudes of representatives of various countries at the recent League of Nations General Assembly. The official expressed his opinion, saying, "We are deeply satisfied with the clear attitude and stern language of the representatives of Czechoslovakia, Spain, Greece, Switzerland, and other countries. These representatives were able to recognize the force of the facts contained in the Lytton Report, make a fair judgment, and clearly declare that the League Covenant has been violated, that Japan has exceeded the scope of self-defense, that the 'Manchukuo' was created by Japan, and declare their support for the League Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. They have a clear understanding of the political situation in the Far East, and according to their conscience, they have expressed what they believe to be just claims. They are indeed worthy of the demeanor of statesmen." The official believes that the claims of these representatives are perfectly consistent with the Chinese position announced by our Foreign Minister Luo on August 30 of this year, which stated that "China will never agree to any solution to the Northeast issue that presupposes the bogus organization in the Eastern Provinces created, maintained, and controlled by Japanese force," and that "China firmly believes that the reasonable solution to the Northeast issue in the future must be based on the spirit and letter of the League Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and China's sovereignty, while also firmly consolidating lasting peace in the Far East." The official continued, "Unfortunately, there were opposing views at this League of Nations General Assembly, and the remarks of the British representative in particular have sown a painful impression in the hearts of our people. This impression was further deepened by the irresponsible speech of the Canadian representative. The British representative, Foreign Secretary Simon, said that the Sino-Japanese problem 'should not be based on theory,' 'should not exclude facts,' but should 'seek a factual solution.' Does he mean that Japan's illegal actions should be condoned, and Japan's policy of aggression should be excused?" The British Foreign Secretary described the points more favorable to Japan in the Lytton Report in detail, while deliberately omitting the points that criticized Japan and its policies. It is indeed doubtful whether the British Foreign Secretary is acting as a lobbyist for Japan." The official concluded, "We still hope that Britain can carefully consider its attitude in the League of Nations. Britain must know that if it can sincerely cooperate with other member states, it will not be difficult to achieve a legal and fair solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute."

<p>Japanese Request Extradition of Su Bingwen</p>

<h3 id="e18">Karakhan Indicates <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>That the Disposition of Su is a Domestic Political Matter</p>
<p>That No Other Government Can Intervene</p>
<p>White Russians Openly Conduct Anti-Soviet Activities in Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese Government Has Never Consulted About Disposition Methods</p>
<h3 id="e19">Su Bingwen on His Way to Europe <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - TASS released detailed information today regarding Japan's request for the extradition of General Su Bingwen and his subordinates, and the Soviet Union's refusal. According to reports, when Acting Envoy Abukoh requested the extradition of Su from Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan, Karakhan told him that the disposition of Su and his subordinates was a domestic political issue of the Soviet Union and could not be interfered with by any other government. It is reported that after Su and his troops retreated into Russian territory and were disarmed and temporarily detained, Japanese newspapers, official news agencies, and even the Japanese Foreign Ministry and military department made various contradictory reports about Su's fate, especially regarding the conversations between Abukoh and Karakhan in Moscow. Therefore, TASS specifically released the following detailed information based on reliable official sources: On December 8, Acting Envoy Abukoh, representing the Japanese government, requested the extradition of Su and his subordinates from Karakhan. Abukoh relayed the instructions of his government as follows: The Japanese government has the responsibility to maintain the security of Manchukuo. The Soviet government's disarmament of General Su Bingwen and his troops was very appropriate, and the Japanese government is extremely grateful. However, although these anti-Manchukuo elements have been disarmed, if they sneak back into Manchukuo, they will still endanger the security of Manchukuo. Furthermore, if they are released back to China, they will further incite opposition to Japan and Manchukuo and will be warmly welcomed, like General Ma Zhanshan becoming a hero. This situation will help encourage the resistant forces on the border and affect the security of Manchukuo. Therefore, the Japanese government specifically requests that the Soviet Union hand over General Su Bingwen and all his troops to the Japanese army for disposition. Karakhan expressed surprise at Abukoh's words, saying that the Japanese government should not have made this request. The Soviet Union is a neutral and independent country, and not only can it not hand over Su and his subordinates to Japan, but it also believes that the issue of extradition cannot be discussed. Afterwards, Acting Envoy Abukoh expressed his opinion, saying that the word "neutral" cannot be used in this case, because General Su Bingwen cannot be regarded as a legitimate independent party in the war. Su betrayed Manchukuo, disrupted international railway traffic, and condoned acts of destruction and murder. Therefore, he can only be regarded as an ordinary criminal against Manchukuo, not a political offender. However, Karakhan denied this opinion, calling it "inconceivable." Firstly, since the Manchurian Incident, the Soviet Union has declared absolute neutrality, which Japan not only recognized, but also expressed gratitude for several times. Furthermore, the Japanese government sent military officers as representatives to the Mazievska station in Russia to negotiate with Su. If Su is considered an ordinary criminal, the Japanese government would not have gone to the neutral territory of Russia to negotiate peace with Su. It is even more inconceivable for the Japanese government to formally request the Soviet Union to act as an intermediary to negotiate with an ordinary criminal. Karakhan also told Abukoh that the Soviet government, at the request of the Japanese government, contacted Su to release some Japanese nationals. Therefore, before Su retreated, most Japanese nationals were safely released, and the rest were also brought into Russian territory by Su. This righteous and magnanimous gentlemanly behavior can determine whether Su should be handed over to the Japanese army after being disarmed. Finally, Karakhan said that there are tens of thousands of White Russian soldiers in Manchuria and Japan who often try to incite attacks against the Soviet Union, but the Soviet government has never requested their extradition, and the Japanese government knows that they do not represent an independent country and has never indicated that they can be extradited, knowing that this is a purely internal affair of the country. Karakhan told Abukoh that his reply was the Soviet government's official reply to the Japanese government. In the late hours of the day, Abukoh visited Karakhan again, stating that he had abandoned his request for the extradition of Su but requested that the Soviet Union continue to detain Su and that the Japanese government should be consulted first when disposing of his troops in the future. Karakhan replied that the disposition of Su's troops had been declared to be a domestic matter of the Soviet Union and that no other country was allowed to interfere. However, there is another reason in the relationship between Japan and Russia that prevents the Japanese government from making this request. In Japan, especially in Manchuria, tens of thousands of White Russians enjoy complete freedom and operate under official protection. There are even those who work in the Manchurian police and public service agencies. They openly conduct anti-Soviet activities, slander Soviet citizens, and incite other countries to have negative feelings towards the Soviet Union. The Japanese government has never consulted the Soviet government about the disposition of these people, knowing that this is a purely domestic matter of the country. On December 10, Abukoh visited Karakhan again, reiterating the Japanese government's two requests. Karakhan reiterated that the disposition of Su and his troops was a matter of Soviet internal policy and that no other country was allowed to interfere. (Eleventh Day TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>Moscow - After the Soviet Russian government sternly rejected the Japanese's unreasonable demand for the extradition of General Su Bingwen and more than 4,000 soldiers and refugees, Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan expressed deep surprise at Japan's request today. It is reported that Karakhan told the Japanese representative that the disposition of the refugees in northern Manchuria was a purely internal matter and that the Soviet government considered it impossible to have any negotiations. He also cited the example of the Soviet Union never requesting the White Russians who took refuge in Manchuria or Japan, admitting that the Japanese's request was improper. The current Soviet Russian government has resolutely refused the Japanese's unreasonable demand and has declared that not a single one of General Su or the refugees will be handed over to the "Manchukuo" or Japanese authorities. Officials have also stated that the Soviet Russian government will provide the necessary protection for the refugees currently residing within its borders. As for the content of the Russo-Japanese talks, it is reported that the Japanese side argued that General Su was only a criminal and that handing him over to the "Manchukuo" or Japanese authorities would not hinder the Soviet Russian neutrality. Karakhan replied that the Japanese commander recently tried to use Soviet Russian officials as intermediaries to hold peace talks with General Su. If Japan considered him a criminal, how could it try to hold peace talks with him? He also cited the fact that Japanese officials in Changchun and Harbin had repeatedly come to Russian territory to try to hold peace talks. The Japanese also said that although Su's troops had been disarmed, they were still a threat to Manchuria, fearing that these troops would become heroes after returning to their country, which would encourage other troops in Manchuria to betray them. They also claimed that General Ma Zhanshan's resistance to Japan had led to the successive attacks by the righteous armies against "Manchukuo," which had not stopped to this day, which could serve as a lesson. Karakhan replied that tens of thousands of White Russians are currently taking refuge in Manchuria, which is often a threat to his country, but there has never been a discussion between Moscow and Tokyo about this. After the Soviet Russian government sternly rejected the Japanese request for the transfer of refugees, the Japanese diplomatic representative sent out a revised request from the Tokyo government, demanding that the extradition of troops has also been rejected by the Russian government. It is heard that General Su Bingwen has already been on his way to Europe and will present the truth about Manchuria to representatives of various countries, attempting to participate in the discussion of the Lytton Report when possible.

<p>Beiping - Su Bingwen's Secretary-General He Junda telegraphed that after Su and Zhang Dianjiu and more than ten others arrived in Chita, Mo Dehui sent Wang Zensi, accompanied by Zhemilev, a representative of the Russian Foreign Affairs Committee, to Chita on the 8th to welcome them to Moscow. Su and others set off from Chita on the 9th and should arrive in Moscow on the 15th or 16th. After meeting with Mo Dehui, they decided to go to Geneva. Yan, Gu, and Guo have already sent telegrams to Su, expressing their welcome. Su and others will participate in the internal work of the delegation and will compile a special booklet on the atrocities committed by the Japanese in the Northeast to report to the League of Nations. After the matter is completed, they will return to China from Europe. Passports for Su's officers and dependents to leave Russia were completed on the 8th. On the morning of the 9th, they departed from Da Wuli for Vladivostok and transferred to foreign ships to return to China, landing in Qingdao or Yantai. It has been decided that all of Su's troops who entered Russia will return to China. The rumor that some would stay in Russia is inaccurate. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping - Su Bingwen telegraphed a certain important figure from Chita, asking him to tell his family in Dongping that he had set off for Europe and would return to China via Geneva. He will arrive in Moscow within the week. The Russian side is treating him very well along the way. The official sent someone to comfort Su's family. Su's soldiers are still in Russia, and their dependents have been successively returning to China via Vladivostok. (Eleventh Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Prospects for the Second Internal Affairs Conference <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session is scheduled to convene on the 15th. With over forty members having decided to attend, surpassing the quorum of thirty-seven, the assembly is unlikely to fail. It is rumored that the conference will primarily discuss foreign affairs and domestic policies. At this critical juncture of national crisis, while a diplomatic strategy must be determined, domestic reform is also urgently needed. Moreover, these two aspects are closely interconnected. Now, prior to the Third Plenary Session, the Second Internal Affairs Conference, which commenced yesterday and witnessed enthusiastic attendance, further underscores the central government's special emphasis on internal affairs. Their intent to proceed with orderly steps towards genuine remedies sets them apart from the empty formalities and ineffectual approaches of the past. The Kuomintang is currently the sole political party wielding governing power in our nation, and the Ministry of Internal Affairs is the most crucial agency for implementing all national policies. When holding significant meetings, no one detached from politics can fail to harbor earnest expectations and sympathy. However, considering past conferences, proposals were invariably grand, and speeches invariably impassioned, yet resolutions were often shelved indefinitely. The fervent atmosphere would dissipate as the conference concluded, rendering the assembly meaningless. Its value was equivalent to a casual chat among gentlemen, a mere pastime. After repeated disappointments, outsiders can hardly be blamed for their indifference. Prior to this Internal Affairs Conference, key figures informally expressed their views, recognizing the futility of empty rhetoric and emphasizing the necessity of practical implementation. There should be a transformation, signifying a fresh start for this session. As the ancients said, "Effective governance lies not in verbose pronouncements." I urge all representatives attending the conference to deeply contemplate and savor these words.</p>
<p>In reforming domestic affairs, the first priority is to rectify officialdom. Achieving this involves various approaches. Regarding the current malpractices, the following three principles merit attention:</p>
<p>Firstly, clearly define responsibilities. Most middle and lower-level administrative officials today are ignorant of the true meaning of governance. They lack ambition before taking office and have no strategies after assuming their posts. Their goal is to enrich themselves at the expense of the nation, employing cunning and evasiveness as means. The better ones seek only to avoid mistakes, while the worse ones inflict suffering on the populace. Under the illusion of stability, they procrastinate. When faced with pressure, they abruptly resign. Thus, in terms of construction, it is like climbing a tree to catch fish; in terms of serving the people, it is akin to trying to satisfy hunger with pictures of cakes. What "governance" can be expected from such "officials?" The remedy lies in rigorously establishing regulations, assigning responsibilities, and conducting thorough assessments, with clear rewards and punishments. Crucially, they must not be allowed to simply walk away. Officials must realize that their positions are not trivial sinecures, and their departures cannot be easily arranged. Only then can we prevent corruption and block the path of opportunists.</p>
<p>Secondly, strictly stipulate penalties. The rampant corruption among politicians today is an undeniable fact. This corruption stems from the lack of self-respect among deceitful individuals who readily break the law. However, it also results from the leniency of the law, which fails to deter potential offenders. Those who arrive empty-handed leave with overflowing coffers, aiming to amass wealth rather than retain their official posts. Removal from office or dismissal holds little consequence. Demerits and salary deductions are even less concerning. Therefore, the severity of penalties in anti-corruption laws must be increased. Furthermore, a targeted approach is crucial, starting with confiscation of assets, followed by the most severe punishments. This may deter corruption and eliminate favoritism.</p>
<p>Thirdly, ensure reliable guarantees. Among those in government service, are there no upright individuals besides the corrupt and cunning? However, lacking job security, they cannot fully implement their plans. They may be transferred shortly after taking office, or their policies may be abruptly halted. Disheartened, they may resort to procrastination and extortion. It is said that a certain bureau chief, upon taking office, was presented with a meticulously crafted financial plan by his advisors. The bureau chief smiled and said, "The plan is undeniably thorough, but its effectiveness will only be seen after ten years at the earliest. This position will likely change hands multiple times by then." This sentiment is shared by many capable individuals and is the crux of preventing a clean and bright political landscape. Therefore, this Internal Affairs Conference should establish a method for guaranteeing tenure, ensuring that the appointment of lower-level officials is not subject to the whims of superiors. Furthermore, career civil servants should not be transferred along with political appointees. Through the passage of time, a harmonious relationship can be fostered between officials and the people, which would have a positive impact on future cooperation. This is different from those with a "five-day mayor" mentality. Although what has been said above are platitudes, they represent the common aspirations of the people. I dare to take advantage of this opportunity to reiterate them, in order to urge the authorities to pay attention and implement them earnestly.</p>

<h3 id="e21">To Issue a Circular Telegram to the Third Plenary Session <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>丨Text Has Been Drafted and Will Be Issued Soon丨</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Zou Lu, 11th: The Guangdong Central Committee's circular telegram to the Third Plenary Session has been drafted and will be issued on the 12th. Key points of the content: 1. Implement the Southwest's proposal for resisting Japan and suppressing communists. 2. Implement the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session. 3. Prevent the revival of dictatorship. Zou also stated that Liu Luyin has agreed to serve as the Chief Secretary of the Executive Yuan, which is expected to be announced on the 12th. Whether he will concurrently serve as a member of the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Committee is yet to be determined. The League of Nations is hesitant towards Japan, unwilling to deny the puppet state. We must rely on self-reliance to recover our territory, rather than depending on the League of Nations. In addition to providing long-term financial aid to righteous armies, the Southwest is considering providing military assistance. He expects to return to Guangdong at the end of the month.

<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 10th: If everything goes smoothly and there are no unexpected twists and turns, Germany will be able to re-enter the Disarmament Conference soon. The draft plan regarding this matter, which is satisfactory to the representatives of France and Germany, has been finalized tonight. A press release stated that the representatives of the five major powers talked all day, and at 7:30 p.m., they agreed on a method for the governments of France, Germany, and Italy to negotiate on their own. During the negotiations, French representative Paul-Boncour left the conference room three times to make phone calls to Paris to consult with Herriot. When Paul-Boncour hurriedly returned to his hotel, he told a Reuters reporter that things were not going badly, but were not yet finalized. German Foreign Minister Neurath originally planned to return to Berlin tomorrow morning, but has postponed his trip until later in the evening. The hope of the negotiations can be seen from this. British Prime Minister MacDonald is scheduled to have dinner with Paul-Boncour, Neurath, and American representative Davis tomorrow night before departing for London.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 11th: Representatives of the five major powers have signed a declaration stating that the governments of Britain, France, and Italy have announced the principles guiding the Disarmament Conference, one of which is to allow Germany (which must disarm according to the treaty) to enjoy equality in rights and methods. The Disarmament Conference will discuss the implementation of this principle in the future. The governments of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany jointly make a solemn statement that European countries rely on military force. The U.S. government and the governments of the other four countries have decided to cooperate in the conference to seek real methods to reduce and limit armaments.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 11th: Germany has accepted the arms equality plan. The German representative is expected to participate in the meeting of the main committee of the Disarmament Conference on December 13 and participate in the meeting of the General Committee on the 14th.</p>

(2) Britain, France, Italy, and the United States (excluding the United States) issue a declaration based on the declaration drafted by British Foreign Minister Simon, declaring that they will not use force as an instrument of national policy.

<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 11th: Le Temps said that Japan's naval proposals have caused great shock in all sectors of Britain because Japan mentioned the London Treaty and the Washington Treaty, which was unexpected. The newspaper said that Japan's proposal is particularly favorable to France, because it has made concessions to France on the number of effective units. It also retains the convenience of compromising with Italy. Le Peuple said that the figures put forward by Japan actually guarantee its hegemony in the Pacific.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, 11th: Japan's disarmament proposal to the five major powers was officially released today, with a seven-page explanatory memorandum detailing the principles on which maritime disarmament should be based. The main points are that the current scope of the Disarmament Conference is too large, making it difficult to establish a satisfactory and implementable maritime disarmament agreement, and that the new ratio of capital ships should be 11 for Britain and the United States respectively, and 8 for Japan, to replace the ratio of 5:5:3 stipulated in the 1930 London Naval Treaty. Japan's current proposed proposal is: (1) The tonnage and caliber of various warships should be as follows:</p>
<p>Tonnage Caliber (inches)</p>
<p>Capital Ships 25,000 14</p>
<p>First-Class Cruisers 8,000 8</p>
<p>Second-Class Cruisers 6,000 6.1</p>
<p>Destroyers 1,500 5.1</p>
<p>Submarines 1,800 5.1</p>
<p>As for aircraft carriers, they should be completely abolished, and warships should not be allowed to have equipment for the take-off and landing of seaplanes. (2) The maximum number of capital ships should be 11 each for Britain and the United States, 8 for Japan, 12 each for first-class cruisers for Britain and the United States, and 7 each for France and Italy. (3) The maximum tonnage of second-class cruisers in the five countries should be set at 150,000 tons each, and the same for destroyers. Submarines should have a maximum tonnage of 75,000 tons. The principles that Japan intends to reduce its navy on are to reduce offensive power and increase defensive power. Therefore, it advocates reducing the tonnage of various warships, such as capital ships and first-class cruisers, and dividing naval power into powerful types that emphasize relative strength and lighter types for patrolling coasts and sea routes, and for defense. The tonnage and nature of the latter category are determined by the local situation. Japan proposes to divide the world into the Pacific Group, the Atlantic Group, the European Group, and the South American Group, and then determine the quantitative limitations on armaments based on this. Japan advocates that a general agreement on general events should be negotiated first, and then special agreements on local issues and other issues should be formulated.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Present Situation of the Volunteer Army in Heilongjiang <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Harbin: The two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin have already been occupied by Japan. Heilongjiang and northern Jilin have also fallen one after another due to being isolated and without assistance. Although General Ma Zhanshan once used the extremely painful strategy of self-inflicted injury to try to connect with various units, hoping to overthrow the puppet state of Manchukuo in one fell swoop, it would still be a stroke of luck amid misfortune. However, after the second uprising, even if all the flesh and blood, and the sincerity of patriotism, were sacrificed, it could only leave a page of painful history filled with bloodstains in the history of national struggle for future generations to strive for. After General Ma encountered a glorious failure, the wealthy people of the Northeast could only sob in despair, and the hard-working farmers could only wait to be exploited and slaughtered by imperialism. However, under the command of the puppet state, not everyone is a puppet. There are those who pretend to be puppets, shocking national heroes. Who is this person? It is Su Bingwen, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast National Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Under the rule of the puppet state of Manchukuo, although officers of various units reluctantly accepted the appointment of the puppet state, they initially thought that negotiations with Japan were only a matter of time, and that the original state of the Republic of China would eventually be restored. However, as the situation dragged on, it seemed impossible to reverse the situation. Ordinary people were very disappointed, and even officers with a little conscience were filled with resentment. Patriots were all furious. Commander Su Bingwen's preparations for rebellion were not yet sufficient, but the various units of the Volunteer Army in northern Manchuria had run out of ammunition and food. If no reinforcements joined, all previous efforts would be in vain. Therefore, Commander Su could not wait for the time to be ripe or for preparations to be sufficient and resolutely launched the uprising. On the day of the uprising (September 27), he summoned Yamazaki, the Japanese Consul in Manzhouli, Uno, the Chief of the Police Force, and Kohara, the Chief of the Special Service Organ, to the Manzhouli Military Command Headquarters to talk. He immediately ordered them to instruct the garrison to disarm, while women and children could be released and allowed to leave the country. Japanese and puppet officials would be temporarily detained here. Upon hearing of the rebellion of the Chinese army, the garrison disarmed after negotiations. Although Uno was tyrannical and did evil, it was limited, while Kohara was imprisoned for specializing in extortion. Thus, the evil forces were eradicated, our rivers and mountains were restored, and the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun was seen again. Social order was exceptionally peaceful, and the people were happy, celebrating the relief of their suffering.</p>
<p>After Su Bingwen launched the uprising in Manzhouli, Zhang Dianjiu, Xie Ke, Jin Kuibi, Pu Bingshan, and 41 others sent a telegram on September 30, supporting Su as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army and placing all their troops under his command. On October 1, Su Bingwen established the Heilongjiang Provincial Government in Manzhouli, telegraphed the whole country, and took office as the Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army, vowing to resist Japan. Zhang Dianjiu was the Deputy Commander, Xie Ke was the Chief of Staff, and Jin Biku was the Deputy Chief of Staff. The telegram stated: "Our 30 million people in the Northeast have been brutally trampled under the iron hooves of the invaders. We cannot seek death, and we cannot survive. We have been in dire straits for more than a year... But the people's hearts have not died, and the country cannot be destroyed. How can we allow snoring next to our beds? I, Wen, have been waiting on the border, and have been dealing with the national crisis with great care. Fortunately, an inch of land has been preserved. Now, I have been entrusted by the people and supported by the generals, leading the volunteer army to fight for justice and sacrifice myself to serve the country without fear of sacrifice... I must make the true feelings of our 30 million people in the Northeast clear to the world, eliminate the puppet state, eradicate the traitors, expose the tricks of the brutal bandits, and restore the inherent land of China. With the destruction of our homes and the loss of our country, we have long made up our minds to sacrifice ourselves. Even if our strength is exhausted, we must wash away the shame of Li Ling..." The telegram listed the Japanese's atrocities against us and the various conspiracies to create the puppet state. It was a tragic and inspiring act, the most inspiring for the people of the Northeast to resist the strong since Ma Zhanshan's anti-Japanese uprising. Su himself only had two infantry brigades, eight independent companies, and one technical battalion, stationed from Luobin in the east to Boketu. At this time, the people's militia and volunteer army in various counties totaled about 50,000 people. Li Haiqing's troops and Ma Zhanshan in eastern Heilongjiang echoed each other and prepared to jointly attack Heihe. Su's troops, led by Wu Yushu, with more than 2,000 men, crossed the river from the lower reaches of the Nen River on the first day and began to attack Ang'angxi. Zhang Dianjiu's first brigade was responsible for the front of the Middle East Road, approaching Bu Kui directly from the Nen River Bridge. Li Haiqing's troops, with 5,000 men, and Ma Zhanshan in eastern Heilongjiang, launched an attack on Heihe at the same time. Li Haiqing's troops once attacked the Qiqihar Railway Station, but were forced to withdraw due to lack of supplies. The Japanese were caught off guard by Su Bingwen's rebellion. At this time, because the Japanese Consul Yamazaki and 100 Japanese residents in Manzhouli were all detained by Su, and because the area west of Heihe was vast and the troops were insufficient to be allocated, they did not dare to use heavy troops to suppress Su and others immediately. Instead, they sought to resolve the situation through political means. After the incident, Major Miyazaki of the Harbin Japanese Special Service Organ took a plane to Hailar and dropped a letter tube midway, hoping for a peaceful solution. The Volunteer Army ignored it. On the second day, Ji Handong's 2,000 troops of the 60th Route of the National Salvation Army recovered Suizhong and shot down two Japanese planes. They withdrew immediately due to lack of reinforcements. From the second to the third day, the National Salvation Army had repeated contacts with the Japanese army along the Nen River. Zhang Dianjiu's troops were completely concentrated in Fularji. In eastern Heilongjiang, the vanguard of the Volunteer Army reached Hulan River and contacted the Volunteer Army in Lihetun, Anda County. On the second day, the people of Hailar held a mass meeting in Asian Park, paraded, and the whole city went on strike for a day, presenting Su Bingwen with a banner that said "Fighting to the End." The people's feelings were exceptionally excited. At this time, Su's main force was concentrated in Boketu and Zhalan Nor, along the Middle East Road. One supply station was set up in Hailar, Mianduhe, Boketu, and Zhalantun. From Zhalantun in the east to Fularji, Zhang Dianjiu's troops were responsible for the defense. West of Ang'angxi, all belonged to the National Salvation Army's sphere of influence.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 10th: The internal disputes of the National Socialist Party remain one of the most interesting issues in German domestic politics. Recent developments include Strasser's formal farewell to all party members and his departure for Italy. In addition, Dr. Fanglier, the national orator of the National Socialist Party, has formally written to party leader Hitler, resigning from all positions within the party and declaring that he has found conclusive evidence indicating that the National Socialist Party is subsidized by the manufacturer of Kherni O'Tholhoff, and demanding that Hitler investigate the matter thoroughly. The internal collapse of the National Socialist Party has become an undeniable fact. However, the newspapers of the National Socialist Party are still trying their best to deny the various rumors circulating outside, and listing the declarations of support for Hitler by National Socialist Party members in the Reichstag and Prussian Landtag</p>

<p>Wang Delin and other volunteer armies in eastern Jilin are also actively operating to provide remote support.</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan is advancing from eastern Heilongjiang to attack the Huhai Road, and in the Qingcheng-Bayan area, there are 9,000 volunteer soldiers of the Nan Tingfang's army. In the Tailai Town area, there are more than 1,000 Mongol-Heilongjiang mixed volunteer soldiers, all forming an encirclement around Ang'angxi. It is a pity that there are no precautions in the west of the Greater Khingan Mountains, near Solon, and the flanks may inevitably be attacked.</p>
<p>Su Bingwen sent a telegram to the League of Nations, exposing the Japanese atrocities, stating: "1. Japan has forcibly occupied the Northeast with an aggressive policy, falsely claiming to represent public opinion and organizing the puppet state of Manchukuo, which has lasted for more than a year. The Chinese people are completely opposed, and the entire Northeast has fallen into endless turmoil. Although Japan has stationed heavy troops, it has no ability to maintain治安, and the various acts of killing, raping, and plundering are all outside the bounds of justice and humanity. Now, three-quarters of the residents of the Northeast cannot make a living. This action harms the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, and the international community has delayed until now and has no ability to restrain and stop the Japanese atrocities. The Chinese people cannot but take urgent and effective means of self-defense. Recently, the Japanese militarists have brazenly concluded a treaty of recognition with the puppet state of Manchukuo, monopolizing the resources of the Northeast and sealing off international commerce. Our people in the Northeast cannot endure it..." After this telegram was sent, the Japanese side had more scruples, and the people of Jilin and Heilongjiang were encouraged. On the 22nd, the Japanese side sent Jin Xianli, the puppet mayor of Qiqihar, to Zhalantun to negotiate with the representatives of the Su army on the issue of releasing Japanese expatriates, demanding that Su Bingwen stop resisting Japan and opposing Manchukuo, and promising to continue to serve as the commander of the Hulunbuir Garrison and pay him 300,000 yuan in military expenses as a condition for releasing Japanese expatriates. Su Bingwen knew that their purpose was to protect the Japanese expatriates and did not immediately refuse, but agreed to consider it. From the 21st to the 23rd, there were fierce battles in Fularji and Huerhula, and the volunteer armies appeared and disappeared in various places, with alternating victories and defeats. The Japanese army sent planes to reconnoiter the area west of Zhalantun. On November 1, Su's first and second brigades, with 16,000 men, advanced towards Fularji from the Zhujia Kan and Yaoku Le areas, and the left-wing cavalry advanced to Hailatun. On the night of the 3rd, Li Haiqing's troops attacked the Ang'angxi station, and Pu Bingshan's troops advanced towards Yingtun, also gaining an advantage. However, the Volunteer Army lacked ammunition, and although their momentum was strong, they could not withstand the fierce artillery fire of the Japanese army. The Japanese army also often used planes to bomb the Volunteer Army's positions, so our side suffered considerable losses. On November 4, Chief of Staff Iso of the Japanese Army again proposed peace talks to Su Bingwen. Su proposed four conditions for a ceasefire: (1) The Japanese troops in Fularji would withdraw and be stationed by Su's troops; (2) Pay 300,000 yuan in back pay; (3) Manchukuo must "show sincerity"; (4) Not a single Japanese soldier may enter Hulunbuir. The Japanese side found these conditions difficult to accept, but the Japanese army believed that the peace talks were not yet hopeless. On the 10th, they sent negotiator Colonel Komatsubara by plane to Mazulef Kaya in Russian territory to request Su Bingwen to send a representative to negotiate peace terms. Su still refused. The Japanese army headquarters then decided to sacrifice the Japanese expatriates in Manzhouli and launch an attack. On the 19th, the enemy, covered by tanks, began to attack the Peng Hua Zhen position, and the puppet army also attacked from Linjia Dian. After three days of fierce fighting, the Volunteer Army fell one after another, with many casualties. At the same time, in eastern Heilongjiang, the Japanese army began a seven-pronged attack on Baiquan on the 17th, intending to disperse the forces of Ma Zhanshan first, and then attack Su westward with the main force. Therefore, there were fierce battles in the Baiquan-Mingshui area for several days. The Ma army was still wearing unlined clothes, and they lacked both guns and ammunition. They constantly engaged in hand-to-hand combat, fighting in the snow and ice, with their hands and feet frozen. The Japanese army advanced with planes and tanks in large numbers. After three days and nights of bloody battles, the Ma army had to retreat to Tongbei. On the 12th, Su Bingwen, Ma Zhanshan, Ding Chao, Li Du, Wang Delin, Li Haiqing, and other anti-Japanese generals from the three provinces jointly sent a telegram to the League of Nations, first describing the process from September 18 to the forging of public opinion and the organization of the puppet state of Manchukuo, then describing the fact that the people fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army for a year, and the tragic situation of the Japanese army killing more than 50,000 innocent people. They solemnly declared that the people of the Northeast would only resist the brutal Japanese and would never surrender. Unless all 30 million of our people were killed, the puppet organization would never be allowed to exist, nor would any illegal rights and interests be recognized, nor could we abandon sovereignty and create a so-called co-management situation. No one in China dares to allow the division of our territory. Even if the government cannot recover the lost territory by force, the people will unite and vow to drive the Japanese invaders out of the country and restore our rivers and mountains. The Japanese were even more angry upon hearing this. The Japanese army immediately defeated the Ma army in the east and returned westward with their troops. At that time, the situation of the National Salvation Army was as follows: (1) The main force of Pu Bingshan's troops had moved to the vicinity of Nehe, and they had been counterattacking for days, with alternating victories and defeats. (2) Ma Jun's Xu Zicui brigade was stationed northeast of Ningnian. (3) Deng Wenda was in the Anda area and had occasional contact with the enemy. Li Haiqing's main force was in the Wangkui-Anda area. (4) The two troops of Cai Hongyou and Li Lingji were frequently active in the Hailun-Suihua-Hulan area on the Huhai Line. On the 27th, 28th, and 29th, the citizens' groups and commercial federations of 30 counties in Heilongjiang Province, and the Hulunbuir Mongolian banner, held a representative conference in Hailar, deciding on 17 articles of the anti-Japanese program, and unanimously vowed to resist Japan to the death. The people's morale was extremely high, but the National Salvation Army lacked supplies in the rear and had difficulty in combat. The Japanese army also specialized in bombing with planes. How could flesh and blood easily resist bombs? Now they can barely hold on, but what will happen in the future? I am afraid there is more pessimism and less optimism. (November 30)</p>

<h3 id="e55">Passing Through Xunyang, Stopping Briefly to Receive the Commanders Leading the Communist Suppression Campaign in Jiangxi; Will Arrive in Nanjing on the 12th Without Delay Along the Way <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Hankou: Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Suppression Campaign in the three provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, has been stationed in Hankou for more than seven months. The remaining communist bandits have been largely wiped out. As the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee is approaching, he urgently needs to return to Nanjing to attend. In recent days, he has summoned various circles and given farewell speeches. He originally planned to leave Hankou on the 9th to go east, but he had to attend the public memorial service for Yue Weijun, so he postponed it for one day. On the morning of the 10th, at 10 o'clock, Chiang went to the public memorial service for Yue at the General Chamber of Commerce to pay his respects, and then returned to the headquarters to summon officers above the rank of major for instructions, encouraging them to be hardworking, cautious, and service-oriented to complete the communist suppression campaign. He also gave instructions to Chief of Staff Cao Haosen, Secretary-General Yang Yongtai, Zhu Shaoliang, the commander-in-chief of the Communist Suppression Campaign in the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, and others. At 11 o'clock, he met with Xia Douyin, Wei Lihuang, and others in Yihe Village, and gave them face-to-face instructions. At 11:30, he and his wife, Ms. Song Meiling, and the sons and daughters of Kong Xiangxi, took a car to the Sanbei Wharf and boarded the Yong Sui warship. Along the way, the ports were guarded by troops dispatched by the Garrison Command. Military and political dignitaries who went to the wharf to see him off included Chief of Staff Cao Haosen, Secretary-General Yang Yongtai, Chief of the Adjutant Office Chen Xizeng, Director of the Transportation Department Lin Xiang, Director of the Pacification Office He Chengjuan, Commander-in-Chief of the Border Area Zhu Shaoliang, Chairman of the Provincial Government Xia Douyin, and members Kong Geng, Li Zhoucheng, Shen Zhaonian, Yan Xunfu, Xia Yuanhuan, Mayor of Hankou Rao Guozhen, Commander of the Garrison Ye Peng, and members of the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters, members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others, more than a hundred people in total. They all boarded the ship to pay their respects, and Chiang comforted them one by one. After more than ten minutes, the farewell personnel disembarked and stood in unison on the dock. Chiang stood on the deck to see them off. At half past twelve, the Yong Sui flagship set sail. Chiang was wearing a gray wool uniform and had a happy smile on his face. He left Hankou amidst the cheers. The Chu You warship followed to escort him. In addition to a part of the entourage who had taken the Feng Guo passenger ship to Nanjing the day before, the rest took the Jiang Hua and Han Ping chartered ships to the east. Secretaries Deng Wenyi and Li Wan and others were on the Chu You warship. It is said that when Chiang passes through Jiujiang, he will meet with Jiangxi Chairman Zhao Shihu and the commanders leading the Communist Suppression Campaign on the ship. There will be no other delays. It is estimated that he will arrive in Nanjing on the 12th. As for the members of the Hankou Committee, in addition to Chiang, there are Xia Douyin, He Chengjuan, and Jian Dajun. Qian Yu left on the 9th, Xia took the Jiang Hua ship east on the evening of the 10th, and He Kunfu returned to Hankou from northern Hubei. All official duties are still to be handled, so he could not travel together. According to news from the Pacification Office today (December 10), He has set a schedule to fly to the former place on the 13th.</p>
<p>Large Army Concentrates in Shaowu in Northern Fujian</p>
<h3 id="e56">Will Join Forces with the Armies in Eastern Jiangxi to Suppress the Communists <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Fuzhou: The Lin Biao faction of the Red Communist Pseudo First Army in northern Fujian, after withdrawing from Jianyang and Jiangle, still occupies Shaowu and Guangze. Pacification Director Chiang Kwang-nai, after inspecting northern Fujian on the 26th of last month, ordered Liu Heding, commander of the 56th Division, to lead his troops from Jian'ou via Jianyang, and Zhang Yan, deputy commander of the 61st Division, to lead his troops from Yanping via Shunchang, to attack Shaowu at the same time. On the first day of this month, Shaocheng was recovered. The remaining bandits are still hiding in Guangze. The Liu and Zhang divisions and the various units of the 4th Independent Brigade of Zhou Zhiqun have successively entered Shaowu City. Therefore, there are three brigades of troops in Shaoyi. It is planned to leave half of them in Shao to search for scattered bandits lurking in various places, and the other half to attack Guangze, to cooperate with the troops in eastern Jiangxi. As for Qian Yuguang, the deputy brigade commander of the 3rd Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army stationed in Pucheng, he was ordered a few days ago to open to the eastern district of Chong'an, vacating the defense area to be stationed by the 21st Division of Liu Zhennian. As Qian is leading his troops to depart, the Provincial Government received a telegram from Qian's brigade yesterday (4th) reporting that they have arrived at Wufu Huangtu and other places in eastern Chong'an. However, after the place was robbed, the people fled and there were only a hundred old and weak people left in the entire area. The scene was desolate and extremely tragic. In addition, Liancheng County, which borders the four counties of Changting and Longyan in western Fujian, and Yong'an and Qingliu in northern Fujian, was just recovered by the joint efforts of the people's militia in various districts last month. On the 28th of last month, it was again captured by more than 1,000 bandits from the 2nd Detachment of the Guard of the Pseudo Central Soviet Government, who attacked from the two routes of Zhudi and Weidi. They then joined forces with the Pseudo 35th Division and the Pseudo 8th Independent Division to advance on Gutian Meicun, plotting to peep into Yong'an and Qingliu. Lu Xingbang's division has sent troops to block them. (December 5)</p>
<p>Shen Honglie Widely Consults Elders and Asks About Their Sufferings</p>
<h3 id="e57">A Decoration for the 10th Anniversary of Qingdao's Reception; A Total of 160 Elders from Various Villages Arrive <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Dispatch from Qingdao: Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, in order to understand the sufferings of the people and strive for rural construction, specially hosted a banquet for elders over 80 years old from the rural areas on the 10th of this month, taking advantage of the 10th anniversary of Qingdao's reception, to ask about their sufferings and show respect for the elderly. Beforehand, he also ordered the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus to actively prepare for the reception. The elders from the various rural areas were separately welcomed to the city by receptionists sent by the municipal government on the 8th by car and ship, and separated in Sanyi Inn, Liansheng Inn, Donghua Hotel, Yingzhou Hotel, Yutong Inn, Jiaoao Hotel, and the First Hotel. Two receptionists were assigned to each place, and 20 police officers were dispatched by the Public Security Bureau to protect them properly. In addition, four doctors were selected from the Municipal Hospital to visit the elderly's dormitories twice every morning and evening, from the day the elders arrived in Qingdao until the day they left, in order to be ready to provide medical care at any time. The number of elders who arrived from each rural area was: 13 from Licun District, 54 from Cangkou District, 16 from Xuejiadao and Shuiling Mountain Island, 27 from Jushui District, and 21 from Yin Island District, totaling 160 people. Yesterday morning (9th) at 8 o'clock, the elders from the various rural areas were accompanied by receptionists to the city government auditorium. Before long, Shen Honglie arrived and delivered a speech, roughly stating that it has been ten years since this city was recovered. Looking back on those years, we must have a commemoration. Taking advantage of this tenth anniversary, I have invited all the elders to come here for a talk. I have been in charge of the navy and stationed in Qingdao for eight years. I was ordered to take concurrent charge of municipal administration last year, and it will soon be a year. My hometown is also engaged in agriculture, and I know the suffering of the people very well. I am eager to relieve the people of their suffering. However, in order to promote the interests of the local area and eliminate malpractices, we must first focus on rural construction. Therefore, the municipal government has successively established five rural construction offices in the various rural areas. The purpose is to help the people do things and relieve the suffering of the masses. Since the opening, the staff of each office and the local people have been able to cooperate quite well, and the results have been good. The progress in repairing roads and running schools has been very rapid, which is a good phenomenon. There are two things that I urgently want to ask about this time: (1) Are the things done by the government suitable for the people's feelings? (2) What are the matters that should be handled in each district, and what has not been done yet? I hope the elders will not be polite, and feel free to criticize and answer. The municipal government is determined to handle matters in accordance with the will of the people. I have finished speaking, and the elders can express their opinions as much as possible. Then, several elders told Shen about the various sufferings of the people, and Shen adopted them one by one. Then, the various bureau chiefs asked questions one by one in accordance with the predetermined articles. Lei Fazhang, director of the Education Bureau, was responsible for asking questions to the elders in Licun District. Chu Zhen, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, asked questions to the elders in Cangkou District. Ge Jingying, director of Agriculture and Forestry, asked questions to the elders in Xuejiadao and Shuiling Mountain Island. Xing Qixin, director of the Public Works Bureau, asked questions to the elders in Jushui District. Qi Yunji, secretary of the Public Security Bureau, asked questions to the elders in Yin Island District. The elders, because the bureau chiefs were earnestly questioning them and their attitude was kind, told them the truth. The bureau chiefs then reported the elders' intentions to Shen in detail. Shen returned to the auditorium and gave a detailed explanation of the various items that were asked of the elders, and said that the bureau chiefs and the directors of the various offices were all present, and that they would study what the elders hoped for and do everything possible. The elders were all happy and joyous when they heard this, and some of them sang praises to Shen, wishing him "long life and immortality for ten thousand years." Their joy can be imagined. Although the elders were all over 80 years old, many of them were very energetic, and there were five who were over 90 years old. They then went to the mayor's official residence to attend Shen's banquet. In the afternoon, they visited the Minsheng Factory, the Reformatory, and the People's Education Center (National Art Exercise). At 6:00 in the evening, the bureau chiefs hosted a dinner at the mayor's official residence. At 8:00, they went to the Shandong Grand Theater to watch a movie. It is said that it was decided that tomorrow (11th), cars and small wheels would still be sent back to the various villages. (December 10)</p>
<p>Hunan Province Issues Paper Money to Purchase Grain</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Provincial Bank Issues 1.5 Million Yuan in Paper Money to Purchase Large Quantities of Rice for Transportation to Hankou for Sale, Establishing a Separate Sales and Transportation Agency with Completely Independent Accounting <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The Hunan Provincial Bank was established with a capital of 2 million yuan allocated by Lu Diping when he governed Hunan. Initially, it did not issue paper money. It was not until last year that He Jian approved the issuance of fractional notes, divided into three denominations: 1 jiao, 2 jiao, and 5 jiao. Originally, only 500,000 yuan was issued, but it was subsequently increased twice, and now the total issuance has reached 1.5 million yuan. Because it is fully backed by cash reserves, its credit is considered sound. Now, the provincial government, considering that Hunan Province has had a bumper harvest this year, resulting in excessive stockpiling of grain with no one to transport and sell it, and that the rural economy and market finance have been greatly affected, has decided to have the bank issue an additional 1.5 million yuan in one-yuan paper money to be used for purchasing grain for transportation out of the province. A Grain Transportation and Sales Committee has also been established to oversee all matters. Yesterday, Zhao Heng, the president of the bank, submitted a proposal to the provincial government outlining the method for issuing additional paper money and transporting grain. The submission reads as follows: "In accordance with your order, this bank is investigating the proposal to issue an additional 1.5 million yuan in Hunan Provincial Bank notes to purchase grain for storage, which will be kept by the bank as collateral for the additional banknotes and will not be allocated or borrowed to maintain credit. In the meantime, the Grain Transportation and Sales Committee's letter states that market finance has been stagnant recently, and there has been no improvement in grain circulation. The committee resolved at its plenary meeting yesterday to sell 100,000 shi of grain purchased by your bank on a temporary basis, transport it to the creek in batches, store it in warehouses, and sell it at the appropriate time. If the price is acceptable and sales are somewhat active, please continue the transfer to avoid hoarding, etc. As it concerns the relief of the rural economy and the regulation of market finance, it is imperative to act without delay. A proposal for issuing additional banknotes and purchasing and transporting grain, along with the reasons, was submitted to the Bank Supervisory Committee for resolution. (A) The revised main points of the banknote printing method were passed as follows: (1) The name should only state the Hunan Provincial Bank. (2) The denomination is one yuan, and it should state that it is fully redeemable, with the total amount in accordance with the provincial government's instructions. (3) The location of the banknote printing will be determined by the head office. (4) The method for managing the reserve fund will be formulated separately by the head office and submitted to the meeting for public resolution. (B) The method for purchasing grain was passed in accordance with the method proposed by the head office, etc. Originally, the bank intended to solicit the consent of the Grain Transportation and Sales Committee and hire Luo Shendongyang as the director, and request that he find his own assistants, with all expenses to be reported and actually reimbursed, and the profits and losses not to be included in the bank's profits and losses. Subsequently, the Grain Transportation and Sales Committee added a letter urging Luo Shen to take the position, and then rented the house at No. 3 West Chang Street to establish an office, which began operations today. The bank has also issued a seal, with the inscription 'Seal of the Hunan Provincial Bank Grain Purchasing and Transportation Office,' and issued it to the office for use. The above is a summary of the handling situation submitted to your office for review and compliance." (December 9th)</p>

<p>Public Security Bureau Auctions Smuggled Silver Ingots</p>
<h3 id="e59">No One Asks About the Auction Date, Shanghai Chaozhou Merchants Still Request Return <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Shantou Municipal Government issued an order in October prohibiting the export of silver cash in order to maintain market finance. However, most merchants only pursue their own private interests and continue to smuggle exports, causing a shortage of silver in the market and subsequently increasing daily interest rates and exchange rates. The municipal government, believing that merchants are incorrigible, ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly enforce the ban. On the 17th of that month, 24 boxes of silver cash being transported to Shanghai were intercepted in a lighter on the sea. Except for seven boxes with customs supervision passports, the other seventeen boxes of silver ingots were immediately detained, and six silver smugglers were arrested. The criminals confessed to the Public Security Bureau that they had cast silver dollars into silver ingots. The Public Security Bureau then confiscated all of the silver ingots for use by the police training center and to purchase short guns. It is estimated that the seventeen boxes of silver are worth about 120,000 yuan. However, silver merchants were not convinced and submitted a petition to the higher authorities requesting their return, but it was not approved. Yesterday, the provincial government approved the Shantou Public Security Bureau to auction the silver. The bureau immediately announced that bidding would take place at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 5th, and stipulated that the price of silver ingots would be calculated at 95% of the price of silver ingots within this ten-day period. Unexpectedly, no one went to vote on the afternoon of the 5th. It is said that the silver industry decided not to buy the silver. Miscellaneous merchants did not know the quality of the silver and did not dare to vote rashly. Moreover, they could not transport the silver to other ports for sale after buying it, so no one paid any attention to it. The Public Security Bureau has now rescheduled the vote for the 8th, and it is feared that no one will buy it at that time either. In addition, the Chaozhou Guild in Shanghai sent a telegram yesterday to the Eastern District Security Appeasement Commissioner's Office, the Chaozhou Customs Supervisor, and the Municipal Government, stating, "We have now received letters from Guanghua Zhuang, stating that seventeen boxes of silver ingots and six escorts who had been approved to be transported from Shantou to Shanghai in October were detained and announced to be confiscated and punished by the Shantou Public Security Bureau. The silver ingots were made by melting old silver utensils and are a type of cargo, so there is no discrepancy in allocating them for export. Please forward our request to return the people and goods." At the same time, we also received letters from Shanghai's Guanghua Zhuang agency, Puyi Zhuang, stating that the allocation and transportation of silver ingots were entrusted for collection and exchange, and the funds were prepaid. The detention of the silver ingots was unexpected. The end of the year is approaching, and finances are tight. If implicated, the impact will be significant. Please forward our request to the provincial Shantou authorities for verification and approval to return the silver ingots to the various Zhuang to avoid being implicated. Our guild believes that silver ingots are not prohibited items, so they should be allowed to be exported. Since the customs has approved their release, why does the Public Security Bureau overstep its authority and illegally announce confiscation and punishment, and detain people? This matter concerns merchants' capital and market finance. We urge you to investigate and promptly order the release of the seventeen boxes of silver ingots and six escorts detained by Guanghua Zhuang, etc., to alleviate merchants' difficulties and maintain commerce." It is unknown how this case will be resolved. (December 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Zhangjia Living Buddha Goes South and Passes Through Xu <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: The Zhangjia Living Buddha left Ping on the 9th after becoming the Xuanhua Envoy of the Mengqi Banner on the 5th. The special train, in one column, arrived in Xu at around 1:00 PM today (the 10th). Central Committee Member Enhe Batu accompanied Zhangjia. Those accompanying him south included Counselor Awang Dorji, Secretaries Xu Siqing and Li Wentai, Chief of the General Affairs Department of the Embassy Li Shan, Chief of the Religious Affairs Department Gong Shushi, Senior Consultant Shang Wu, and about 30 other staff members and guards. I boarded the train to visit, first meeting with Enhe Batu and Secretaries Xu and Li, and Department Chiefs Li and Gong. Then, Consultant Shang accompanied Zhangjia to meet me. Zhang wore a black long leather robe, with a light gray silk jacket on the outside, Qing silk cotton shoes, and a leather hat. He was short, stout, and vigorous. He took off his hat to greet the guests. Shang said that Zhang Buddha was not proficient in Chinese and would provide a written statement for everyone to publish. Zhang then returned to his room and produced the following written statement: "On the 5th of this month, I took office in Peiping and established the embassy. I originally intended to depart immediately to various Mengqi Banner places, but because of important issues regarding the Mongolian border, it was still necessary to discuss them with the central government. Therefore, I went to Beijing first. I was unable to delay there much. But with the Third Plenary Session about to open, the central government officials will definitely have an important expression of all major plans. Therefore, I also intend to return north after the Third Plenary Session closes. The essentials of Xuanhua are nothing more than the propaganda of the central government's policies and doctrines. However, the implementation steps are planned to start with religious affairs and to refer to the conditions in various places. It is essential that the Mongolian Banner people recognize their own positions, have patriotic enthusiasm, and eliminate the temptation of red and white imperialism. This is because the Mongolian Banners have always extremely believed in Yellow Religion, so it is necessary to embody propaganda in education, so that the effect is easier to realize. After I return to Ping, I will send staff to depart separately. I will first go to Rehe, because the current situation makes Rehe more important. How do you, the public, who preside over public opinion and lead the society, see things? I am very willing to listen. "At that time, Zhang's Beijing representative, Bao Kangzhi, had just come from Beijing to Xu to meet him. Also present was Jin Guan Zhang's representative. Zhang planned to tour Xu for half a day and visit famous historical sites. He then got off the train. Shang Wu temporarily found and pointed out Zifang Mountain to Zhang, the place where Zhang Liang disbanded Chu soldiers. Zhang seemed unaware of Zhang Liang's history and asked his accompanying old scripture teacher, Ye Xi, about it. Ye, with his white head and beard, replied in Mongolian. After Zhang reached Bao Xing, Guan Linzheng, the commander of the Fourth Independent Brigade and the Xuzhou Garrison, also came to meet him. Zhang continued to travel by car to famous scenic spots such as Yunlong Mountain Fanghe Pavilion and Dafosi Temple. He returned to the car late in the evening. It is estimated that he will arrive in Beijing tomorrow. (December 10th)</p>

<p>China Institute of Mining and Metallurgy</p>
<h3 id="e62">Please Maintain Jiaozuo Mining Rights <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<h3 id="e63">Oppose the Merger of the China and Fu Companies <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The China Institute of Mining and Metallurgy submitted a petition to the National Government against the merger of the "China" and "Fu" coal mines in Jiaozuo, Henan Province, stating that the Fu Company in Jiaozuo, Henan Province, is a British-owned company registered in London, England. After the Sino-Japanese War in the late Qing Dynasty, the British took advantage of the Qing Dynasty's decline to obtain mining rights for coal mines in five counties bordering Henan and Shanxi. Later, the people of Shanxi opposed this and organized the Baojin Company to recover the shares and conduct mining on their own. The company then used the name of the Yu Feng Company to obtain mining rights for the Hanshan coal mine north of the Yellow River in Huaiqing Prefecture, declaring that the mines for which Yu Feng applied for mining rights could be transferred to the Fu Company. After the Boxer Rebellion, they used the name of the Fu Company to accept Yu Feng's mining rights. At that time, the people of Henan Province strongly opposed this, but to no avail. It was not until the beginning of the Republic of China that the landlords formed the Zhongzhou Company to compete with it. The company also protested to the government, but Yuan Shikai did not dare to offend foreigners. Therefore, the government acted as a mediator and ordered the merger of the Chinese companies to organize the Zhongyuan Company, which would use the Fu Company's method of separate mining and joint sales to eliminate competition. Until the May 30th Massacre in the Republic of China, the Fu Company's miners went on strike to support diplomacy. As a result, the Fu Company was closed down and has remained in a stalemate until now, unable to formally resume work. Recently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent personnel to Henan to mediate and propose that the Zhongyuan Company be merged into the Fu Company, and that the Zhongyuan Company be valued at 5.05 million yuan and the Fu Company at 4.95 million yuan. The chairman of the board would be from the Zhongyuan Company and the vice chairman would be selected by the Fu Company. It was also said that the Fu Company had already agreed to this principle of joint investment. As soon as this proposal was made, the people of Bo'ai County rose up in opposition, and mining groups in various places also believed that the merger of "China" and "Fu" would undoubtedly give away Chinese mining rights and that the future was extremely dangerous. The institute, composed of miners from all over the country, believes that at this critical juncture concerning the life and death of our country's mining rights and the right to exchange currency, the heart is in danger, and we are unwilling to remain silent. There are various reasons why the "China" and "Fu" cannot be merged, which must be presented to your office.</p>
<p>(1) Coal mines are necessities for civilized peoples, the main fuel for modern industry, and must be managed by the state to prevent private monopolies and gradual autocracy and to avoid unequal distribution of wealth and social revolution. According to the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's instructions, all should be operated and managed by the state. Our country's iron mines were almost completely lost to the Japanese at the hands of past national traitors and treacherous merchants who were good at currying favor with foreigners. The Hanyeping Company is a precedent. In terms of coal mines, Fushun has fallen to Japan and Kailuan has been lost to Britain. Although the government has established sorting committees for the two mines, it has been difficult to reverse the situation due to the accumulated problems, and after several years, it has been unable to salvage the situation. With the overturned cart in front, how can we bear to repeat the same mistake? This is one reason why "China" and "Fu" should not be merged.</p>
<p>(2) In recent years, the Zhongyuan coal mine has made considerable profits due to the Fu Company's shutdown, and the Taihang Mountain area is densely populated. What people rely on for their livelihood is coal mining. Therefore, for thousands of years, they have been self-mining and self-selling, which is enough to support themselves. Since the Fu Company invaded the mining rights, the old civilian kilns have been forcibly occupied, and prices have been raised to speculate. The people's livelihood is almost cut off, and local order has been presented. Fortunately, the emergence of the Zhongyuan Company can still accommodate indigenous workers, the price of coal is reduced, and the people's difficulties are also relieved. At present, the annual coal sales in the area are more than enough to be supplied by the current Zhongyuan Company. If the two mines are merged and the production and capital are concentrated to the highest degree, the poor will become poorer and the rich will become richer. The local economic situation will be greatly affected, the people's livelihood will lose its basis, and the chaos will be difficult to clean up. This is the second reason why "China" and "Fu" should not be merged.</p>
<p>(3) If it is said that joint venture operation is a principle stipulated by the central government, and that foreigners are allowed to invest, it is also based on mining laws and regulations, and all Chinese people should abide by it. According to the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings on using foreign capital, "If the right to develop is in our hands, we will survive, and if it is in the hands of others, we will perish." However, according to the contract signed between the Fu Company and the Yu Feng Company in the 24th year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, "All scheduling of mining affairs and mining projects shall be handled jointly by the general manager of the company and the general manager of the Yu Feng Company. There shall also be one Chinese and one foreign director for each mining plant. The Chinese director shall handle negotiations and the inflow and outflow of money, the foreign director shall be the general manager, and the Chinese director shall audit the above clauses." From the perspective of the time, the Chinese directors did not have no power, but it did not take long for the darkness to be revealed. The name of the Yu Feng Company and the powers of the Chinese directors were completely reduced to nothing, and the mining industry was exclusively occupied by the Fu Company, causing problems that have not been solved to this day. With the rights in the hands of others, what is the use of regretting too late? Furthermore, Article 8 of the revised articles of association of the Zhongyuan Company's shareholders meeting in April of the Republic of China states that shares may not be transferred or mortgaged to non-Chinese. In the era of the previous warlord government, it was still stipulated that foreigners were not allowed to buy shares. Under the rule of the Kuomintang, it is truly incomprehensible to use this inferior strategy and give others a handle. The authorities are wise and will not do this. China, with its undeveloped geographical advantages, itself is limited by its financial resources. Therefore, it may need to rely on foreign capital to develop it. This does not mean that there is no need for joint ventures with foreigners. It must also be used by us. If this case is used as a condition for international exchanges and mutual assistance for friendship, there are still many industries in China that have not been developed that must be a joint venture, so there is no need to focus on the merger of the "China" and "Fu" mines and please the British. This is the third reason why "China" and "Fu" should not be merged.</p>
<p>(4) Our country's coal production reaches 25 million tons per year, of which the Fushun coal mine operated by Japan and the Kailuan coal mine controlled by the British produce nearly 14 million tons per year, which is more than half of the country's total output. The output of the two mines is rich and the consumption is light. Recently, the two mines have further reduced prices to compete for sales, and the country's coal industry will be unable to save itself. If the China and Fu companies are merged again, it will be like adding another formidable enemy to the country's coal industry. The trend will lead to a situation from which there is no recovery. Moreover, the British merchant Kaiping survived by merging with Luanzhou, and the Fu Company failed by leaving Zhongyuan. Merger benefits others, while non-merger benefits us. Its story is clear, and its reason is obvious. This is the fourth reason why "China" and "Fu" should not be merged.</p>
<p>(5) Article 8 of the revised articles of association of the Zhongyuan Company's shareholders meeting in October of the Republic of China states that shares may not be transferred, gifted, or mortgaged to non-Chinese. In the era of the previous Northern warlord government, it was still stipulated that foreigners were not allowed to buy shares. Even in the time when the evil Yuan Shikai was in power, the Zhongyuan Company, which was allowed to be jointly established by Chinese, and the Fu Company used separate mining and joint sales methods to eliminate competition. Now, this is merged and abolished. Under the rule of the Kuomintang, this kind of phenomenon is happening. How can we protect the foundation of the country? How can we gain the trust of the people? This is the fifth reason why "China" and "Fu" should not be merged. (6) Article 41 of the original contract of the Fu Company states, "If one party denies all or part of the clauses of this contract, this contract shall be invalid." The Fu Company has violated the contract and has not been able to fulfill it to this day. The people of Bo'ai County have already filed a complaint by telegram. In May of this year, Bai Da, the general manager of the Fu Company, admitted his mistake at the Henan Construction General Assembly in the presence of representatives of the people of Bo'ai. The fact that he could not fulfill the contract is obvious. The only plan for the present is to take advantage of the situation to declare this contract invalid in order to lift the shackles of unequal treaties for decades. Instead of coming up with this plan, the profitable Zhongyuan Company, which is run by ourselves, is forcibly merged into the Fu Company, which is used by the British as an instrument of aggression and violates the contract. It is really unknown what their intentions are. In the past, during the era of the joint sales of the Fu Zhong General Company, shareholders' profits were often less than one cent. Now, the Zhongyuan Company is able to distribute dividends of two fen three li. This is the effective result of not cooperating with the Fu Company. If we merge with it now, the profits will inevitably be deprived by the Fu Company by 50%. In terms of the effectiveness of the contract, there is only one way to cancel it. In terms of the interests of the shareholders, there is absolutely no need for a merger. This is the sixth reason why "China" and "Fu" should not be merged.</p>
<p>(7) The Fu Company has a deep grudge against the local area. This time, when it tried to start mining, the people of Bo'ai County gathered near the mining area without prior agreement, willing to fight to the death, tens of thousands or in groups. If it is necessary to have it resume work and co-operate with the Zhongyuan Company, although it will never cause a major incident. This is the seventh reason why "China" and "Fu" should not be merged.</p>
<p>Based on the above seven reasons, the reasons why "China" and "Fu" cannot be merged are very obvious. However, the authorities of the Ministry of Industry are unable to take this opportunity to free themselves from constraints, but are instead tempted by the sweet words of the Fu Company, ignoring the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, advocating this sticky discussion of merger, in order to curry favor with foreigners. The people are panicked and do not know what to do. Reluctantly, we can only beg your office to comply with the sentiments of the people and promptly order the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to abolish the proposal to merge the "China" and "Fu" mines immediately in order to maintain public opinion and protect national rights.</p>

<p>Shanyang Farmers Resist Robbery and Die</p>
<p>Pu Meisheng, a resident of Maqiao Township, Shanyang, usually worked as a farmer for a living and was somewhat well-fed. Suddenly, at midnight on the 7th, seven or eight bandits came and smashed open the main door. His father, A Xiao, was awakened from his sleep, got up quickly with his clothes on, and tried to hold the door shut, but the bandits' brother was unstoppable and fired a gun. Unexpectedly, his father was shot in the lower body, blood flowed, and he died immediately. Seeing the disaster, the bandits dispersed in fright. Later, Wu Zhongxian, the town mayor, reported to the 16th District Office, which forwarded the report to the county government, which ordered the arrest. The Department of Education sent a commissioner to Songjiang to inspect.</p>
<p>The Provincial Department of Education Sent Investigators</p>
<p>The Provincial Department of Education sent Chief Compiler Yi Changzuo and Inspector Zhou to Songjiang to investigate the provincial middle schools and the educational administration and school education of various counties. Yesterday, they went to the provincial schools to inspect and investigate everything.</p>
<p>Commander Cao Inspects the Student Soldiers' Company</p>
<p>The former commander of the 2nd Security Regiment stationed in Songjiang, Cao</p>
<p>Pang, was ordered to lead his troops to Huining to suppress bandits, leaving the student soldiers' company stationed in Songjiang for training. The people of Songjiang, believing that the Jiangbei banditry had been quelled, had telegraphed the province requesting that Cao be transferred back to Songjiang, but to no avail. Now, Commander Cao took the opportunity to inspect the training results of the student soldiers' company in Songjiang this month. Leaders of various agencies specially held a banquet at the Chamber of Commerce to welcome him and strengthen ties.</p>

<p>Huazang Mountain Bay Reports Another Robbery</p>
<p>Huazang in the 17th District of the county</p>
<p>In the Shanwan area, at about 11:00 PM last night, six or seven bandits suddenly came to the home of resident Fan Lianfang, armed with sharp blades, electric batons, and other weapons. They spoke with a northern accent, broke down the door, and tied up Fan Lianfang first. Then, they separated and robbed for about two hours, looting ten yuan in cash, four sets of short shirts and trousers, 167 bean cakes, and five strong pigs, before roaring away. Afterwards, the 14th Branch of the Zhangshe Town Public Security Bureau in charge of the area seized a suspicious boat on the Mengwan River bank and arrested five suspects, Liang Dejin, Liang A'er, He Zhaoming, He Zhaoyu, and He Zhaoyou, all of whom denied the robbery. They were immediately sent to the County Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Cables the Reorganization Office</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government decided to abolish the Department of Industry. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce believed that this matter concerned the future of industry and had a particularly significant impact at present. Yesterday, it telegraphed the national and provincial governments separately, requesting that the order be withdrawn to emphasize industry. The original telegram is recorded below: Nanjing sent to the Central Political Conference, Chairman of the National Government, Cup of Military Commission, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Premier of the Executive Yuan Song, Minister of Industry Chen Junjian, and the report said that the Jiangsu Province Department of Industry has decided to abolish it as a provincial government. Central officials are not the ones that a local government should change events. The industrial relations of the people of Su Province are under the jurisdiction of the construction hall, and the affairs are not specialized. This is not an intention to attach importance to the industry, and Director He has been in Su for many years and is familiar with the people's conditions. The former tube mining, now brown industry, Cheng Lai Zhaoran, reputation Su Fu, Liang Zai Dongjian in the industry at this time, the society is living in a state of depression. Zheng Lai government advocated slightly maintaining a line of vitality. This time, the Jiangsu province suddenly abolished the Industry Department, which is tantamount to announcing to the people of Su that all industries can be abandoned. It really makes the people of Su unable to escape death, wandering and pleading. Please be aware and correct it. The Su provincial government should immediately revoke the case of the abolition of the Industry Department, issue a clear order to revoke it, so as to avoid confusion and re-emphasize the industry. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce bows to the true desire to wait for orders to the extreme,</p>

<h3 id="e64">Public Security Bureau Chief Accused of Thorough Investigation <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Liu Hanzhen, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, has been in office for more than eight months. Due to lax management, incidents such as the expulsion of Li Mutang, the chief of the First Branch, by the police in the northern outskirts, and Zhou Fankai's, the patrol captain, affair with the female prisoner Feng Qimei, have occurred. Recently, citizens such as Zhang Xiaoyi have submitted a report to the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting the dismissal and punishment of the police due to such phenomena. After receiving the report, the Department of Civil Affairs approved the investigation and sent personnel to Jiangyin to conduct a secret investigation and report back for review.</p>
<p>Changshu</p>
<h3 id="e65">A Tragic Incident Arising from Business Competition <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Celery is a type of agricultural product, and this county is a major producer of it, with annual exports of approximately two hundred thousand gold dollars. On the Shanghai side, the He Cheng Tong Ji Earth Products Firm, located at Lao Zha Bridge, has dispatched a dedicated representative to Changshu for procurement, resulting in exceptionally prosperous business. In addition to employing the resident director, Shi Haifu, they also employ seven or eight experienced clerks. Consequently, the majority of celery produced throughout the county is purchased by them. This lucrative situation has unfortunately led to a tragic and bloody incident. Since the He Cheng firm enjoys a monopoly on the local celery, other parties inevitably covet this business. However, due to the firm’s years of establishment, it has been difficult to break their hold. This autumn, a new firm, the Tong Tai Qia Ji Earth Products Firm, has also been established in Shanghai, near Lao Zha Bridge, and is attempting to compete with He Cheng. Since its opening, it has also sent representatives to Changshu to procure celery, but has not been as successful as He Cheng. As a result, there have been repeated conflicts between the employees of the two firms. Recently, Shi Haifu of He Cheng has been under pressure from the new firm, causing daily exports to plummet, averaging no more than twenty bundles per day. Consequently, the two sides have engaged in even more intense scheming and plotting. Until the other day, a brawl broke out. As a result, the new firm suffered losses. Yuan Shengzi and others went to the county to report their injuries. However, in retaliation, they immediately sent a telegram to Shanghai. Upon receiving the telegram, the Tong Tai firm, seeing that they were at a disadvantage, decided that a radical solution was necessary. They then invited Zhu Chang of the Axe Gang, intending to kill Shi Haifu of the old firm and others. On the morning of the ninth, sure enough, Axe Gang leader Lu Genlin led twenty or thirty followers, taking the Shun Li steamer to Changshu, stopping near Fan Jia Du, Xiaodongmen. They then searched in various directions, but bystanders were unaware of their purpose. Around eleven o'clock, before lunch, they learned that Shi Haifu was at the Qing Sheng Teahouse, and went there immediately. However, they were unable to find him. So they swarmed to the Tian Pan (where celery is processed) next to the Five Old Peaks, and saw the clerk Zhou Erbao, who was sorting celery. The Axe Gang members immediately rushed forward and hacked at Zhou. As a result, he received three axe wounds to the back, one to the right thigh, one to the armpit, and one to the left foot. Zhou immediately fainted and fell to the ground. Seeing that their plan had succeeded, the gang members dispersed. Li Sanzi and others, who were nearby, saw what happened and immediately reported it to Shi Haifu. Shi then entrusted someone to take the injured man to the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, report the incident, and request the apprehension of the Axe Gang. The branch police then sent Zhou Erbao to Jishan Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, because such a tragic incident was unprecedented in Changshu, it is said that Officer Song issued an order dispatching police to search for the gang and impounding the Shun Li steamer, detaining its captain, Gong Chuangen. When questioned, Gong claimed to be a roughneck operating in Shanghai, and that he had been hired by Lu Genlin to come to Changshu, and was unaware of any killing plot. However, there were pistols and axes on the boat, and he was afraid of being harmed, so he did not report it. Subsequently, the police arrested gang leader Lu Genlin and followers Xu Yinhai, Yan Daxing, Zhang Zhiqin, and four others. At seven o'clock in the evening, they were escorted to the Public Security Bureau, where they were interrogated by the head of the judicial section. Lu and the others only admitted that Lu Genlin was the leader of the Axe Gang, 34 years old, living on Bansongyuan Road, Shanghai. They claimed that they had come to Changshu to investigate the celery gang's fight, and had not assaulted anyone, fearing that they were using a "bitter meat" trap. They claimed that since they were members of the Axe Gang, they would take responsibility for their own actions, and there was no need to deny it. The other statements were similar to the above. That night, the bureau detained all those involved. The next day (the 10th), they were handed over to the county government. However, on the night of the incident, rumors spread that more than twenty members of the Axe Gang had arrived on a Kunshan steamer and were hiding in the Xiayou East Monk Temple. Upon receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched a large force to search, but found nothing. However, to prevent any unforeseen circumstances, the authorities imposed a curfew and conducted overnight searches of all hotels, especially in the Five Old Peaks and Fan Jia Shi, deploying more patrols. Fortunately, nothing happened overnight. As for Zhou Erbao, who was injured in the attack, he is currently 44 years old. After being sent to the hospital, Dr. Huang examined him and found that the axe wound to the armpit was the most dangerous, while the others were not life-threatening. However, due to excessive bleeding, there may be complications. Zhou regained consciousness around 3 or 4 pm and was able to speak. He said that he had a 76-year-old mother, wife, daughter and several other family members, and that he earned 18 yuan a month, which the family relied on for their livelihood.</p>

<p>At around ten o'clock last night, the home of Xue Buzhou at Daopeng Temple outside the South Gate was suddenly invaded by more than ten bandits speaking with a foreign accent, wearing felt hats and galoshes. They first fired a shot and then broke through the side door and entered. Xue Buzhou and his wife, hearing the alarm, quickly hid in the pigsty, escaping harm. His elder brother, Xue Quan, was unable to escape in time and was tied up and tortured by the bandits. They robbed him of clothing and more than four hundred silver dollars, and after searching for an hour, they left with a whoop.</p>

<p>At 2:00 pm, the meeting was announced to be in session. After the music was played, Chairman Xu Zicheng reported that "During the January 28th Incident, the 50th Troop organized a battlefield rescue team. Unfortunately, the four martyrs Luo Yunxiang and others went missing. Although we tried our best, we were ultimately disappointed. We are holding a memorial service today, but we still cannot see the loyalty of the four martyrs. Therefore, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Central General Association specially presented honorary medals, but this still cannot express the bravery of the four martyrs. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is building a memorial tablet." Then, General Assembly representative Teng Jie presented the honorary medals and delivered a speech, and Ye Chunnian, the head of the 50th Troop, led the music without playing it.

<h3 id="e72">Chairman's Speech <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>General Assembly representative Teng Jie delivered a speech, saying, "Chairman, distinguished guests, Boy Scout comrades, today the Shanghai Boy Scout Council is holding a memorial service here for the four Boy Scout martyrs of Songhu. President Chiang Kai-shek of the Boy Scout General Assembly is unable to attend in person due to busy government affairs, so he has specially sent his brother to represent him and posthumously award honorary medals. In this great and solemn ceremony, in addition to representing the President in expressing great respect, one's heart is filled with infinite grief and emotion. We recall the past revolutions and the memorial services held to commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the cause and for the nation, and we have held them countless times. But in the Boy Scout movement, the sacrifices made in this way can be counted as the first. It is not only the first time for Chinese Boy Scouts, but also probably the first time for Boy Scouts in the world. So this must be considered the most tragic and glorious page in our Boy Scout history. We know that during the European War, Boy Scouts from various countries, in order to fulfill their mission of rescuing people, helping others, and promoting world peace, did not hesitate to sacrifice everything to help the disaster victims in the war zones, maintain traffic in the war zones, and treat the wounded and killed soldiers. In four years, we have never heard of Boy Scouts wearing official Boy Scout uniforms and wearing the Red Cross symbol, which prohibits hatred, being brutally murdered. This time, in order to develop its continental policy ambitions and fulfill its dream of unifying the world, Japan invaded our Northeast, which was not enough, and then attacked our Shanghai. The January 28th War destroyed Zhabei, the economic center of our country, and slaughtered countless innocent people. At that time, the 50th Troop, driven by the mission of the Boy Scouts, worked tirelessly and fearlessly, running around and shouting amidst the bombing of airplanes and the shooting of artillery, completely dedicated to rescuing disaster victims and the wounded. At that time, they were not only wearing Boy Scout uniforms, but also wearing the Red Cross symbol. I never thought that the barbaric Japanese would falsely accuse them of being spies and use cruel means to secretly arrest them, destroy their bodies, and eliminate all traces. Our four brave Boy Scouts sacrificed their lives as a result. We know that our Boy Scouts are dedicated to maintaining world peace and dedicated to upholding justice and humanity. Anyone who opposes Boy Scouts, hates Boy Scouts, and harms Boy Scouts is trying to undermine world peace and violate justice and humanity. This kind of person is the common enemy of our Boy Scouts, the common enemy of Boy Scouts all over the world, and the common enemy of all mankind. For the sake of seeking world peace and upholding justice and humanity, we Boy Scouts should appeal to Boy Scouts all over the world and appeal to all mankind to rise up and overthrow this common enemy of mankind. This time, the struggle of our 50th Troop was to fight for justice, humanity, and world peace. The sacrifice of the four Boy Scouts was also a sacrifice for justice, humanity, and world peace. This kind of struggle and sacrifice has infinite value and infinite glory. Therefore, our un-dead 50th Troop Boy Scouts and the un-dead national Boy Scouts, in addition to passive commemoration, must actively continue their spirit to prepare to overthrow the world's common enemy. That is, our 50th Troop must continue this spirit, and the national Boy Scouts must follow the spirit of the 50th Troop in this struggle and sacrifice. Only in this way can we hope for the revival of our national spirit, and can we hope for the realization of world peace. Only then can we be worthy of the significance of holding this memorial service today."</p>

<p>After the medal presentation ceremony, the memorial service was held. After the elegy was played, Chairman Tong Hangbai led everyone in paying their highest respects to the martyred heroes and delivered a eulogy, saying, "Today is the memorial service for the four martyred heroes. We are not just holding this memorial service and ending it. Boy Scouts serve the community and rescue people on the battlefield, and unfortunately sacrificed their own lives. This spirit is valuable. I hope that the people of our country will embrace this spirit to recover the lost territory of the Northeast. The four heroes sacrificed themselves for the country, and they have fulfilled their responsibilities as citizens. I know that the four heroes all served in the business community, and that they engaged in Boy Scout training and served the community in their spare time. This is admirable." After the flower offering, Wu Letian read the eulogy, and General Assembly representative Teng Jie, General Assembly Director representative Xu Guanyu, Chinese Red Cross representative Ji Heqin, Municipal Chamber of Commerce representative Wang Xiaolai, Boy Scout Council Director Wang Gang, and others led all the Boy Scouts. Mayor representative Xu Peihuang, Garrison Commander representative Zhang Xiang, Municipal Party Headquarters representative Zhu Jiaxiang, and others successively offered sacrifices. After the speeches, Mao Zhixiang, the representative of the families of the four martyrs, delivered a thank-you speech, saying, "Luo Yunxiang and others sacrificed their lives for the public good. We are grateful to the Chamber of Commerce and the Red Cross for their condolences, to the President for awarding honorary medals, to all sectors of society for their memorial services, and to the Chamber of Commerce for building a memorial monument. Although they are dead, they are still honored." Finally, the elegy was played.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Mr. Wang's Speech <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Xiaolai's speech, today the Boy Scouts of our city's Chamber of Commerce, opened a memorial service for the Luo Mao Ying Bao four members who were martyred in the Songhu War, Cheng Party, government, military organs, and all circles came to Bao, and came to pay their respects, one side is to express respect for the dead, and the other side is for the national crisis that continues to come, I want to take this opportunity to arouse deep awareness and seek a great self-help method, so we initiated this meeting, and the meaning of each sector is not to pretend to be a scene, or to join in the fun. Xiaolai, in the name of the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, has a closer relationship, and because I instructed them to serve, so today I have unlimited sadness, first, this Boy Scout is trained by the Chamber of Commerce, their relationship with the Chamber of Commerce is like a father and son. The martyrdom of the four members is like the martyrdom of their own children. These four people are all brave and promising young people. They should do a lot of things when they are alive. In this way, they will be buried, and they will not even see their bodies, which is really a sad thing. But from another perspective, Taishigong said something like this, called death heavier than Mount Tai, and lighter than a feather, so their death, died for saving compatriots, died for not surrendering to the enemy, is the glory of the Chinese Boy Scouts, and the glory of the families of the four members, and the glory of the 400 million people of our Chinese nation, in other words, do our children not want them to be Shi Kefa or Wen Tianxiang, and must they be Zheng Xiaoxu or Yu Chonghan? I think no father will want this. Boy Scouts serving on the battlefield, because he is a rescuer, not a combatant, originally there is no reason for him to be killed by the enemy, but how can they waste these reasons? Now the national crisis is expanding day by day, and the spirit of our Boy Scouts' service must also increase day by day, and the places to sacrifice in the future will not be many. The country has reached this point, we cannot avoid danger, we can only harden our scalp and go to work on the road of self-help, so I hope that our Boy Scouts, and the families of our Boy Scouts, will encourage courage and not be discouraged by the tragic death of the four members. Second, our memorial service is not a joke, but to make the compatriots in the country who have not suffered disasters, turn around and think about it, our Northeast has thousands and thousands of volunteers who are fighting the enemy desperately, those who died died, those who were injured were injured, isn't the tragic and enthusiastic situation hundreds or thousands of times more than our Boy Scouts? Then, who else is holding a memorial service? Why not? Because the people of the East and the two provinces have become the people of a fallen country, if you want to express something, he will treat you as a traitor and kill you happily, as the old saying goes, called death without a burial place, the volunteers in the three northeastern provinces have reached the point of death without a burial place, so today's memorial service is not just a memorial service for our four Boy Scout martyrs, but also a memorial service for the thousands and thousands of unnamed heroes who died to resist Japan, but what is the use of just memorializing? We must have the determination to recover the lost territory, and the preparation to recover the lost territory, then today's memorial service is meaningful, the conditions for Boy Scouts are the three words of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, I say that our work of saving the country cannot be separated from these three words. Confucius explained the definition of wisdom, benevolence, and courage, called good learning is close to wisdom, practicing is close to benevolence, and knowing shame is close to courage. These three sentences are really prescribing medicine according to the current situation. To save the country, we must first study knowledge, and it is impossible without wisdom, to save the country, we must do it in a concrete way, and empty words are not enough, this is the definition of the four words of wisdom and benevolence, the meaning of the third sentence is more profound. The 19th Route Army and the Northeast Volunteer Army, in terms of material equipment, no one can compare with the enemy, the reason why they died as women, is because they deeply imprinted the two words of national shame in their minds, so they are not afraid of anything, this is called knowing shame is close to courage, so our memorial is not to join in the fun, but to ask everyone to take the three words of wisdom, benevolence, and courage as a creed, and take on this responsibility of saving the country together, this is Xiaolai's personal thoughts, if there is anything wrong, please ask the guests to correct me.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Xu's Speech <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahua, the Preparatory Director of the Chinese Boy Scouts Association, gave a speech on behalf of Xu Guanyu, saying, "Today's memorial service for the four Boy Scout martyrs is the most sorrowful and glorious gathering in the history of the Chinese Boy Scouts. Why? Because the younger generation is to be held in awe, and the future of young people is limitless. The loss of one young person is a loss to the country. In particular, older people have a warmer feeling for the younger generation, and they feel particularly saddened by this kind of loss. What's more, the sacrifice and suffering of these four Boy Scout martyrs are beyond description in words. Secondly, why do we feel it is the most glorious? We all know that the existence of human life has two elements: one is the physical body, and the other is the spirit. However, the physical body is limited by time. Whether it is humans or chickens and geese, they cannot resist the coming of death. However, the spirit is eternal. We seek the eternity of the spirit even at the cost of sacrificing our lives, and this is our noblest behavior. So, how can we make the spirit last forever? It is to contribute our personality, affairs, scholarship, words, and deeds to human beings, achieve the world, raise the status of the country, and promote the happiness of the nation, just as the ancients said, 'Establish virtue, establish merit, and establish speech.' Now, these four Boy Scout martyrs were brutally murdered because of their love for the country, helping others, serving the community, and assisting refugees. We all know the brutality of the other party's actions, and there is no need to go into details now. But these four martyrs promoted the virtues of the Boy Scouts, sacrificed themselves to save others, and achieved such glory today. Not only will the dead smile in the afterlife, but we, as members of the Chinese Boy Scouts, should all be deeply proud of it. From the above two meanings, we can see that there are two tasks that we need to work hard on in the future. First, we need to think about how to eliminate the grief of today. In other words, we need to think about how to eliminate all the obstacles that cause the grief of the Chinese nation. In simple terms, we need to find a way to seek the independence and freedom of the country and its middle-level international status, so that such grief will not happen again in the future. In recent decades, the deaths of Chinese soldiers and civilians like these four Boy Scouts have not been statistically recorded. If we look at history and recent records, we will know in detail. We must always be vigilant. Second, we must maintain this glory and promote it. How? We can earnestly implement the Boy Scout's oath and regulations, practice the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, be a loyal citizen in the country, a good citizen who helps the weak and serves the society in the community, and strive to be a member of the family who shares the responsibilities of parents. That's all. If every Boy Scout is like this, and every Chinese youth is like this, the Chinese nation will naturally become great and strong and will no longer be insulted or bullied. Since this is the case, how should we strive to realize the above two tasks? We should not be discouraged, abandon ourselves, or be sad in the future. Only if everyone is willing to hold their heads high and chest out, be as hardworking and responsible as a camel, as great and brave as a lion, as lively and alert as a hunting dog, and as gentle and peaceful as a sheep, and recognize that the blood shed by the martyrs is illuminating the path for us</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>to build a new China of the people, by the people, and for the people. Then, one day, we will reach the goal we hope for. The late Premier taught us, 'Peace, struggle, and save China.' Let's encourage each other."</p>
<h3 id="e79">Erecting a Monument <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The monument to the four martyrs was built in front of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's auditorium, facing northeast. It was constructed by the Xin Jin Ji Construction Company at a semi-voluntary cost of over 700 yuan. It is about two zhang tall and one zhang square, surrounded by iron railings and adorned with gold lettering. The top of the spire and iron fence is crowned with the Boy Scout emblem, and the surrounding area is densely planted with flowers, grass, and trees, creating a very solemn atmosphere. Cai Tingkai, the army commander of the 19th Route Army, inscribed the four large characters "Sacrifice for the Country." The inscription on the monument was written by Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: "On January 28, 1932, the Japanese army attacked Zhabei and failed, and then the army, navy, and air force attacked Shanghai in separate routes. In order to rescue refugees and wounded soldiers, this chamber dispatched Boy Scouts to form rescue teams for rescue and care. Members Wei Yunxiang, Mao Zhengxiang, Ying Wenda, and Bao Zhengwu, four non-combatants, were killed by the enemy. This is unheard of in international law. We have collected funds to comfort their families, and erected a monument next to the courtyard of this chamber to record the circumstances of the four men's martyrdom, in order to express their loyalty and inspire future generations. Alas, the souls of the pioneers have not returned, and the barbarians are already grazing their horses in the south. Let those who come after us strive for the cause. This inscription was written on the anniversary of the national crisis on September 18, 1932."</p>

<p>Unwilling to Force Herself to Go to Nanjing</p>
<p>Central Committee member He Xiangning replied yesterday to a letter from the Special Party Department of the 15th Army Division, saying, "Since the September 18th Incident, I returned to China. Not long after, the Shanghai war broke out, and I engaged in relief work. During this time of national crisis, I have fulfilled the responsibility of a citizen, which led to illness and heart disease. I have been bedridden for more than half a year. Following the advice of doctors, I have been resting behind closed doors and have declined worldly affairs. The carriages in front of my door have long since disappeared. Now I have received letters from the Central Committee and your Special Party Department urging me to go to Nanjing to attend the Third Plenary Session. I believe that the national situation has been critical for a long time. There are many respected figures and famous party and state figures who are attending. If everyone can show sincerity and work together to overcome the national crisis, the attendance of one or two people will not be a problem. Otherwise, what good would it do? With my ailing body, lacking strategies for restoring the country and relieving the people, I would be of no help. I am unwilling to force myself to go to Nanjing and worsen my illness. If the pillars of the party and the state can be mindful of the precariousness of the national situation and the suffering of the people, reverse the practices of the past, and vigorously implement the National Revolution of Premier Sun and resist imperialism, restoring the revolutionary spirit of the Thirteenth Year of the Republic, then even if I die ten thousand times, I would not dare refuse, let alone cherish my sick body. I ask myself that I have no connection with any political factions. All those who can relieve the suffering of the people and bring glory to the nation are my friends; otherwise, they are my enemies. This is my humble opinion. Whether you understand me or blame me, I do not care. He Xiangning."</p>

<p>Going westward from Hankou along the Yangtze River, from Xindi to Jianli, has always been an area where communists have been active. Honghu, their base, is nearby. After a thorough suppression this summer, it was cleared by October. The embankment construction period coincided with the height of communist activity. The embankment works from Xindi to Jianli were under the jurisdiction of the Sixth and Seventh Engineering Bureaus. The work process was extremely difficult. According to Chen Chongwu, director of the Sixth District Labor Relief Bureau, and Chen Zerong, engineer of the Seventh District Labor Relief Bureau, the communist party's brutal killings during the work in the bandit areas were chilling. However, at that time, in order to provide relief to the flood victims and the lives of the people in the area, they resolutely disregarded everything and sent Luo Jingtang, a technician from the first five sections of the Sixth District, and Liu Xianjie, a technician from the last five sections, to the Xindi bandit area to negotiate with the communists about embankment construction methods. At that time, the Soviet Provincial Government of the Xiang and Hubei Provinces under the communist party had established the Xiang-E-West District Riverbank Water Conservancy Committee. After presenting the conditions, it was stipulated that the embankment workers, wages, grain, and the management and control of the workers should be under the full authority of the Soviet government. The Labor Relief Bureau could send supervisors to reside and monitor, and be responsible for contacting the transportation of grain and payment of wages. The Labor Relief Bureau acknowledged and followed these conditions one by one, and then organized the Jianli Embankment Construction Committee, with three members from the Communist Party and two from the Labor Relief Bureau. There was also the Jianli Embankment Construction Supervision Committee, which was entirely filled by communists, so the real power was completely in the hands of the Communist Party. However, because the command was unified and the action was rapid, when construction started, it was planned to recruit 20,000 workers in three days, and it was fully staffed by the second day. In the Guanyin Island area of the Seventh District, because the water flow was turbulent, it was necessary to pump water before the embankment could be built. The communist party organized a women's group to take charge of the water pumping work, and technicians Xue Zuotang and Zhao Guangguo from the Seventh District were appointed as managers, and the order was quite good. After the start of construction, the local security regiment suddenly came to attack. The communists believed that the contact person for the embankment construction had tipped them off, and arrested them, claiming they were spies. After strong arguments and investigations by the communists in all directions, it was proven that the information was inaccurate, and they were able to preserve their lives. At that time, the monthly salary of the communist embankment committee members was only six yuan, the monthly salary of the district government chairman was four yuan, and the wages of the soldiers were eight yuan. It is estimated that among the embankment personnel working in the bandit areas, those who were arrested by the communists included: (1) Four people were arrested in Jiayu, Sixth District, two of whom were released immediately, and the remaining two were detained for more than ten days before being released; (2) Four supervisors and engineers were arrested in Fangjiawan, Ninth District, Xiang River, and released shortly after; (3) Eleven people were arrested in Guanyin Island, Seventh District, at the end of May this year, and were escorted to the Zhuhe bandit government for detention. In August, Zhuhe was recovered, and they regained their freedom, but their hair had grown several inches long and they were no longer recognizable.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Hujia Island New Embankment <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 6th, the Wan'an wheel arrived at Hujia Island, about twenty miles from Xindi. The entire delegation disembarked on sampans and walked about a mile to reach the Hujia Island embankment, which was built by the Sixth District Labor Relief Bureau. Beyond this was built by the communists. According to the villagers, there is a security regiment stationed here, so the communists have never been here. Four or five miles from here is Huangmu Mountain, where the communist township government is located. When they were rampant, they would come to harass at night, sometimes a few people, sometimes more than ten, looting property or kidnapping wealthy residents, and the residents could not sleep at night. Those with a little property moved away one after another, and now they are returning one after another. However, the accumulation of years has been completely lost, so hundreds of households in the entire village have become slums. The words are extremely miserable. At that time, the embankment workers lived on the ship, working on the river during the day and returning to the ship to rest at sunset, not daring to stay for a moment. At 11:00 AM, the ship reversed, and the ship drove upstream.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Arriving at Yinji Wharf <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Wan'an wheel arrived at Yinji Wharf at 1:00 PM, which is the boundary between Mianyang County and Jianli County, belonging to the Ninth Section Project of the Sixth District. The embankment is the Hongen Embankment, which is ten meters wide and was completely built by the communists. The communists had established the Jianmian Soviet County Government nearby. According to an official from the Sixth District Labor Relief Bureau who was supervising construction here at the time, the communists worked hard because the command was unified. However, the inner and outer slopes of various embankments were not based on engineering principles, but followed the opinions of the villagers. A little resistance would be met with contempt. The communist foremen often made extra demands and harassed endlessly. However, what they got was distributed equally among the workers, without any private corruption. There was a group leader for every four households in the communist party, and the group leader had meetings every day to report on the diligence of work and things when going out and returning. Therefore, there were many eyes and ears, and if any malpractices were discovered, they would be handed over to governments at all levels and punished with the death penalty, without exception. All communists working on the embankment were given passes by the Labor Relief Bureau and could pass through the areas where the army was stationed. As for our supervisors, we lived in a small house next to the district government, with the Red Army guarding outside. When our army attacked, we showed them a specially made blue flag, so they knew we were officials from the Labor Relief Bureau. When the Red Army came, they showed the cloth strips given by the communist side, and they could also enter and exit freely. Therefore, the personnel of the Labor Relief Bureau seemed to be in a third-party position. However, at that time, living in the bandit areas, there were often shameless women ordered to seduce and publicize how the communists were. If one did not hold on to one's ambitions, one would lose oneself to the bandits. Living in the bandit areas, there was no time when one was not trembling with fear.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Record of Inspection in Bandit Areas <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>At 2:10 PM, the ship arrived at Zoujia Wharf, only ten miles from Honghu, the bandit's nest of He Long, and also one of the main strongholds of the communists, about twenty miles from Bailuoji. The communists had a township government there. After the entire delegation disembarked, a skull was found on the river beach. According to Guo Wenfu, director of the liaison office of the Tenth Army, when he was passing west of Xindi on a foreign ship last year, he often saw corpses floating in the river, and there were countless skulls in the bandit areas. Now they have been buried and cleaned up. This is only one in a thousand. The communists' killings and brutality can be seen. Walking a mile, turning and reaching the town, many houses were burned down by the Communist Party and no one repaired them. There were still communist slogans on the walls, which could be vaguely discerned. There were also two notices, one smaller, with only the words Jianli Ninth District Soviet Government Manufacture, February 9, remaining. The other was larger, with the words Xiang-E-West Provincial Soviet Government printed below. The rest of the slogans, such as "Down with White Imperialism" and "Support the Red Army," were visible everywhere. What is most noteworthy is that the boundaries of the fields were completely indistinguishable, because the equal distribution of farmland had been implemented. A certain Zou Yunxiang, who claimed to be the captain of the Luoshan Anti-Communist Volunteer Corps in the Second District of Jianli, was a strong man in his thirties, wearing a gray cloth military uniform. He said that he had once been forced to join the Communist Party and felt all kinds of pain. Now he has surrendered and organized a security regiment to protect his hometown. On the walls of the security regiment's office were posted surrender slogans, saying "Eliminate the communist party that deceives the gods and destroys the Buddha and does not want ancestors," and "Down with the communist bandits who do not produce and rely solely on struggle to make a living," etc. It was also said that everyone here is surnamed Zou, so it is called Zou You Wharf. His elder brother, Zou Yunfeng, is the owner of the security team. Before the communists came, the entire village had about a thousand people, but now there are only a hundred people. Previously, each family had an average of two cows, but now five families only have one cow. And among the only hundred or so people, most are women, the elderly, and the weak. The strong men have almost all been sacrificed. In the Zou Family Ancestral Hall, almost all are spirit tablets for the dead. The reasons for this are: (1) Half of the strong men were forcibly conscripted by the Red Army and mostly died in battle; (2) Those who were lucky enough to not die mostly fled with the Communist Party and their whereabouts are unknown. Now every family is extremely poor, eating small fennel yams. Previously, they rebuilt small houses from large buildings, but now they are demolishing the large buildings and rebuilding small houses. They cannot maintain their livelihoods. If there is no government relief, they will all become starving ghosts. The words were tearful, which were the true circumstances. According to an old man, the bandits were here for a long time. In August this autumn, after Xu Yuanquan's troops from the Tenth Army of the Central Government arrived, they confiscated more than 10,000 guns from the bandits here and killed countless bandits. At that time, corpses were everywhere and the scene was too horrible to bear. Yanglingji is located to the west of the village, facing Ma'anshan, which belongs to Linxiang County. It is also a base for the communists. There is a Dongyue Temple on the shore, which has now been destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Walking Twenty Miles <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>On the night of the 6th, the Wan'an wheel stopped forty miles from Bailuoji because the river water was shallow and not suitable for sailing at night. At 10:30 AM on the morning of the 7th, the ship arrived at Shangche Bay, and most of the delegation disembarked here. Shangche Bay is a small town, and the embankment is called Crescent Embankment. The old embankment has almost completely collapsed, and the new embankment is solid. The entire delegation walked along the embankment. Every few hundred steps, there was a thatched shed, and outside the shed stood five or six strong villagers, carrying large swords and holding red spears, saying that they were the local spear teams protecting the area, with a total of about 800 people. People passing by here had to be checked. Those who had passes and good citizen certificates could avoid being checked. Trenches, barbed wire, and bamboo nails were dug on the embankment. It was heard that two months ago, they were still facing the bandit army across the river, so the defense was extremely strict. The members of the delegation walked on the embankment for 25 miles to reach Jianli City. County Chief Zhou and Zhu Shaobo, the deputy head of the security regiment, led a team to greet them. The members of the delegation briefly had tea and snacks in the thatched huts on the riverbank. Then, because the ship was aground in the shallow water on the river bank twelve miles from Jianli, small boats were borrowed to carry the members of the delegation to the Wan'an wheel, and the Wan'an wheel was dragged out of danger. At 3:30 PM, the ship started to return to Hankou. At 6:00 PM, it berthed on the river surface 120 miles from Jianli. At that time, a Japanese warship was also berthed here. On the morning of the 8th, the ship set sail eastward and arrived in Hankou at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Japanese Consul's Explanation <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The survey team is scheduled to depart by car at 8:00 AM on the 10th to Yuekou, and then take a shallow-draft boat downstream from Yuekou to survey the embankment works along the Xiang River. It is planned to return to Hankou on the 12th, transfer to the Ping-Han train northward, and inspect the embankment works in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and other places. Also, the Japanese Consul General in Hankou, Shimizu Yaichi, specifically went to the Yangtze River Hotel on the morning of the 9th to visit Simpson, the vice-chairman of the Flood Relief Association. Zhou Qibang and Lin Shiliang met with him on his behalf. In addition to explaining in writing the reasons why the embankment works in the Japanese concession had not been completed, the Japanese consul verbally stated that the reason why the embankment works had been delayed was because the budget had not been approved by Tokyo. Now he has received a telegram from Tokyo approving an increase in the embankment construction funds of 78,000 yuan, so it is planned to start embankment construction in February next spring. As for the Embankment Construction Committee of the concession, it will cooperate with the National Government Flood Relief Association in every way.

<p>All Generously Aid the National Art Exhibition Famous Paintings</p>
<p>With the alarming news of the Japanese aggression in the Northeast, people are extremely generous. The National Artist Exhibition organized by the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association, the Republic of China National Salvation Organizations United Association, and the Chinese Calligraphy Association is stepping up its work and actively soliciting works from all parties to hold the first exhibition in Shanghai on New Year's Day next year to help provide funds for the volunteer army. Recently, donations of works from all parties have been continuously increasing. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Luo Junren generously donated Huang Xiaochi's freehand ink plum blossom painting and Wang Shengyuan's "Peach Blossom Spring" painting to the association as an initiative. Luo, who is in the midst of a diplomatic crisis, is still concerned about the soldiers in the Northeast. His concern for national affairs can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Meeting to Repair the Ancient Bell Tower in Beiqiao Town <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Election of Custodial and Works Committee Members</p>
<p>The ancient bell tower of Mingxin Temple in Beiqiao Town, Shanghai County, was built in the Five Dynasties and is the oldest building in the region. It was repaired during the reign of Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty. It is now on the verge of collapse, and local people have planned to initiate repairs. Yesterday noon, County Chief Yan invited initiators from various places to discuss the matter at the Dadong Restaurant. More than forty people attended, including Wang Yiting, Chu Minyi, Zhao Jinqing, Gao Tie'an, Zheng Yuxiu, Huang Ruisheng, Shen Menglian, Huang Yunseng, Yao Xin, and Li Jinhou. At the scene, all the initiators pledged large sums of money and agreed to raise funds separately, ensuring that the ancient relics are preserved and the appearance is renewed. At the same time, Wang Yiting, Huang Ruisheng, and Yang Nianchun were elected as members of the donation custody committee, and Sun Shengzeng, Sun Siben, He Xinyu, Yin Lisheng, and Shen Buying were elected as members of the works committee, so as to be responsible for carrying out the work separately. The collection point was designated as the West Gate Shanghai Bank, and the deadline for ending the donation was before the solar new year. According to County Chief Yan, in the future repair plan, in addition to preserving the advantages of the original architectural style, some land will be set aside next to it to arrange a simple park, which is planned to be named Mingxin Park, as a place for the residents to rest.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Shocking Case of Rape and Death of a Young Girl <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Four-Year-Old Girl's Lower Body Ruptured</p>
<p>Died Two Days Later</p>
<p>A woman named Jiang Mao in Traffic Lane No. 20, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, had a daughter named Jiang Xiaozhu, who was four years old. She was very clever, like a small bird clinging to her mother, and everyone liked her very much. Hu Liao, the wife of Hu Xuan Ting, a Jiangbei native living in the back building, loved the girl very much and often had her sleep with them. Hu also loved her. About a month ago, Hu and his wife were sleeping in the same bed with the child in between them. After some intimate conversation, they began to play with the child. Unexpectedly, Hu Xuan Ting had a curious urge and raped the child. Considering that a four or five-year-old child's reproductive system is not yet fully developed, how could she withstand such abuse? This led to a rupture of her lower body, causing fatal injuries and profuse bleeding. The next morning, Jiang Mao discovered what had happened and immediately filed a complaint against the Hu couple at the Second Precinct of the Fifth District, who were then handed over to the local court for investigation. Little Pearl died two days later. The court sent the body to the Forensic Examination Office of the Ministry of Justice in Zhenru for examination, which confirmed that she had died from rape injuries. The prosecutor then charged Hu Xuan Ting and Hu Liao with the crimes of rape and aiding and abetting rape resulting in death and filed a public indictment. The court session was held the other day by Judge Shen, but the defendants firmly denied the charges, claiming that Jiang Mao was trying to extort money through false accusations. The judge stated that the facts had already been established and there was a forensic report to prove it, so there was no room for denial. He then declared the debate closed and adjourned for sentencing. The defendants were taken back into custody.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Anticipated Celebration of Madam Wang Zhengting's Eightieth Birthday <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>January 10th marks the eightieth birthday of Madam Wang Zhengting, mother of Central Committee member and National Government Committee member Wang Zhengting. It is still remembered that ten years ago, the celebration of her seventieth birthday was held at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, with many people offering congratulations. The Wang family has five brothers; Zhengting is the third. The second brother passed away early, and the eldest brother died this spring. The fourth and fifth brothers are both engaged in industry and commerce and often travel to different places. When the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee closed, Jiang Jieshi and Wang Jingwei telegraphed Wang Zhengting, seeking his consent to serve as envoy to England. He replied that he had an elderly mother at home and could not travel far. This time, he originally intended to hold a celebration, but due to the current national crisis, his mother instructed him not to be extravagant. No invitations will be sent, and only a family banquet will be held. The thousand yuan saved from the banquet will be donated to charity. Gifts from the outside, such as screens, banners, and couplets, will be politely declined as they would only waste resources. If friends and relatives wish to offer congratulatory gifts, the money will also be donated to disaster relief efforts. It is reported that the Fuxu Road Liuhegou Coal Mining Company is handling the matter on his behalf.</p>

Since the September 18th Incident, telecommunications workers across the country have repeatedly and enthusiastically made donations, as reported in the news. This time, the gathering of all the city's workers to perform on stage and raise a large sum of money further demonstrates the patriotic fervor of this community.</p>

<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Yin County government yesterday regarding the auction of Chen Limei's property by the former Ningbo Shatien Branch. The letter stated: "According to the letter from our fellow townsman Chen Limei, Limei purchased a piece of land measuring 1.254 mu located in front of the old Xu Family Gate in Jiaodong, Yin County, in July of the 14th year of the Republic [1925], on which seven single-story houses were built. He holds an imprinted deed and registration certificates No. 1089 from the Zhejiang Shatien Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government and No. 134 from the Ningbo Municipal Government Land Registration Office. Furthermore, in July of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the former Ningbo Shatien Branch re-measured the land and found no excess. He holds the branch's preliminary measurement slip, Ningzi No. 771. Unexpectedly, in September of this year, the branch illegally auctioned the land. He has repeatedly stated his reasons and petitioned the Zhejiang Shatien Bureau for legal remedies, but has been rejected. He has no choice but to ask for help and has attached a document requesting the county government to forward it to the bureau. Chen Limei purchased the land eight years ago, holds grain certificates, and has built houses and managed the property. The branch should not, under the pretext of overdue registration and payment, arbitrarily dispose of the property. Based on the foregoing, we respectfully submit the original petition and request your review and prompt legal remedy to protect the property rights, which would be deeply appreciated."</p>

All are carefully selected masterpieces, some being collaborations between two or three famous artists. The exhibition opened yesterday at the Ningbo Association and will run for five days. A lottery system is used, with each ticket averaging only ten yuan. The usual price for these calligraphies and paintings is several tens of yuan or more, so more than a thousand people attended to view and purchase them. The proceeds from ticket sales, it is said, will be entirely donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Special Alert in the Chinese Concession Yesterday <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Peaceful and Normal All Day</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, yesterday (the 11th) was the anniversary of the Communist Party's Guangzhou Uprising. The authorities in this city received a confidential report that a large number of Communists were hiding in various factories, inciting ignorant workers and unemployed laborers to petition various Party and government agencies in the Chinese Concession and seize the opportunity to riot. After receiving the report, the Municipal Public Security Bureau ordered all district precincts to be especially vigilant. In addition to deploying double guards at all key locations, the inspectors and detectives of the Inspectorate and Detective Team were dispatched to conduct inspections of pedestrians in coordination with the officers of each district precinct and to maintain strict vigilance. Therefore, the city was exceptionally peaceful, and no incidents occurred.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Communists Attempt to Destroy Russian Shanghai Newspaper <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Fourteen Arrested</p>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily, on the night of yesterday (the 10th), there were again communist rioters, who were allegedly plotting to destroy the Shanghai Newspaper, a Russian newspaper in this city. Fourteen Chinese were arrested by the French Concession police. Bricks, glass bottles, and yellow sand were found in their bags. It is said that there have been two previous attempts to attack the newspaper this year. On August 6th, several Chinese communists smashed two panes of glass in the newspaper's windows. Three were arrested by nearby patrol officers. Yesterday, there was a second attempt, and they brought yellow sand, attempting to destroy the newspaper's printing and typesetting machines. The French police received a tip-off in advance, stating that they were planning to act at 11:00 AM. In the morning, they dispatched a large number of detectives in disguise to guard the vicinity of the newspaper office. Perhaps the rioters saw the detectives in disguise and became suspicious, so they did not act immediately. However, the detectives continued to monitor them without懈怠. Until 7:00 PM, a group of pedestrians suddenly appeared. The detectives surrounded them and, after a brief confrontation, arrested fourteen people. Bricks, glass bottles, and yellow sand were found on their persons, and they were taken back to the police station for questioning. It is reported that they were all dressed as students.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Starting from New Year's Day of the 22nd Year, Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescriptions Will Use the New Weights and Measures System <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Right Side of the Prescription Will Be Stamped with the Words "New Scale"</p>
<p>One Old Guan Liang Equals 1.1730 New Liangs</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the Shanghai medical and pharmaceutical industries adopting the new weights and measures system (i.e., the municipal scale), the Social Affairs Bureau previously ordered the National Industry Trade Association to deliberate and respond. The industry subsequently decided to implement the system starting from January 1, 1933. The Social Affairs Bureau then sent a letter to the Education Bureau, instructing various medical organizations to comply at the same time. After receiving the order, the medical organizations in this city repeatedly consulted and discussed the matter, and agreed on a conversion table for the old and new scales, which they submitted to the Municipal Education Bureau. It is now learned that all the traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in this city have decided to comply with the order. Starting from New Year's Day next year, prescriptions will use the quantities in the table and be verified accordingly, and the right side of the prescription will be stamped with a wooden seal that says "The above-mentioned medicines are all new scale." A reporter from the New Voice News believes that this matter is very important as it relates to patients taking medicine. Sometimes patients prepare one or two medicines themselves from traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions. The conversion method of the old and new weights and measures must be detailed and clear to avoid mistakes. He specifically inquired with the Shenzhou National Medical Association and obtained the conversion table and explanation as follows:</p>
<p>Conversion: Cao Ping One He Equals 1.173 Municipal Scale</p>
<p>0.1.5 He Equals 1.7595 Municipal Scale, 2 He</p>
<p>Equals 2.3460 Municipal Scale, 2.5 He Equals 2.932</p>
<p>5 Municipal Scale, 3 He Equals 3.5190 Municipal Scale, 3.5 He Equals</p>
<p>4.1055 Municipal Scale, 4 He Equals 4.6920, 4</p>
<p>.5 He Equals 5.2785 Municipal Scale, 5 He Equals 5.8</p>
<p>651, 5.5 He Equals 6.4516, 6 He</p>
<p>Equals 7.0281, 6.5 He Equals 7.6246, 7 He Equals 8.2111, 7.5 He Equals 8.7976, 8 He Equals 9.3841, 8.5 He Equals 9.9706, 9 He Equals 10.5571, 9.5 He Equals 11.1436,</p>
<p>Explanation: (1) This table is based on the regulations of the city-use system promulgated by the National Government. Cao Ping is the Shanghai 16-liang balance scale. Each jin or liang equals the city jin or liang (1.1730) conversion. (2) For the convenience of our medical community, we have briefly described it. According to the old system, one jin of Cao Ping is divided into sixteen liangs, and the new system also stipulates that one city jin is also sixteen liangs. Therefore, the ratio between jin and jin and the ratio between liang and liang are both (1.1730). (3) One liang of the old Cao Ping equals 1.1730 of the new system. The (1730) after the decimal point can be called one qian seven fen three li. Because after liang, everything is in decimal increments. But at the same time, because the city jin is still sixteen liangs, the (1) before the decimal point should be one jin, and the (1730) after the decimal point represents one-tenth of (1730) jin, which should be multiplied by sixteen to get (2768), which is two liang seven qian six fen eight li. If you ask how many new systems one jin of the old system equals, you should answer one jin two liang seven qian six fen eight li. (4) According to the amount used by our medical community, such as one fen, half a fen, two fen, one qian, half a qian, two qian, to one liang, half a liang, two liang, this table is simple, but it is enough to apply. One liang of the old Cao Ping equals one liang one qian seven fen three li of the new municipal system, and one qian of Cao Ping equals one qian one fen seven li three hao of the new system. Because the ratios listed in this table are all ratios, there is no fixed unit. What kind of unit it is depends on the unit of the old system when it is applied. (5) The above is about converting from the old system to the new system. If converting from the new system to the old system, divide (1) by (1.1730) to get (8525), which is a 8525% discount. Multiply sixteen liang of the new municipal system by (8525) to get thirteen liang six qian four fen of the old Cao Ping, which is also mentioned for the sake of clarity, but it is not actually needed, so no separate table is made.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Request for Protection of the Han Mausoleum <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>To Preserve the Lives of the People of Mengjin</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fundraising Association for Disaster Relief in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei received a letter yesterday from Mr. Li Huanying, a member of the Relief Committee, stating:</p>
<p>Respectfully informing, I have observed that the old course of the Yellow River in Mengjin County, located about twenty-odd li north of the county seat, offers a wide and open view from the northern Mang Mountains, with beautiful scenery, being the birthplace of civilization since ancient times. However, since the early Qing Dynasty, when the river shifted southward, the riverbanks have gradually collapsed, and recently, they have even encroached upon the mountains, and countless villages and farmlands have been submerged by the vast waters. Fortunately, due to the presence of the mausoleum of Emperor Guangwu of the Han Dynasty, the nation has repeatedly allocated funds to construct stone dams, allowing the mausoleum and temples to be maintained, and providing protection for the people. Unexpectedly, on the 10th and 12th of August this year, the river waters rose dramatically twice, causing hundreds of zhang of the riverbank upstream of the Han Mausoleum to collapse, and the riverbed became silted up, as high as the bank, with the old embankment submerged in mud, losing its function. If the water rises again next year, flooding will be unstoppable, and there is a concern that the mausoleum and temples will be submerged. Emperor Guangwu was brave, benevolent, and brought about the restoration of the dynasty, being a rare and exemplary ruler after the Three Dynasties in our country. Later generations, cherishing the memory of his achievements, still wish to protect and glorify the deteriorating mausoleum and the dilapidated temples. However, protecting the mausoleum requires preventing river damage first. If the resting place of the emperor were to be turned into the lair of the River God, it would not only be a laughingstock to both domestic and foreign observers but also cause unease in people's hearts. Moreover, the tens of li of city and people in the eastern half of Mengjin County will soon be submerged, which is also a cause for compassion among benevolent gentlemen. Previously, I accompanied Mr. Dai Jitao and Mr. Wang Yiting on a visit to the Han Mausoleum, where we witnessed the perilous situation. The local gentry and people have long harbored hidden worries, and when discussing the danger of river disasters and the calamity of submersion, they were almost in tears. Mr. Dai and Mr. Wang were also deeply moved and considered ways to prevent this major disaster from happening. I have long admired your association's efforts in reviving what has fallen into disuse, upholding morality and justice, saving people from fire and drowning, and benefiting all living beings. Your benevolent heart and reputation are universally admired. Regarding the submersion of the Han Guangwu Mausoleum and the death of the people in half of Mengjin County, you should have the same sympathy for relief. Previously, Mr. Cai Lianggong, an engineer from the National Government's Water Disaster Relief Committee, surveyed the engineering work at the site and made a thorough and solid plan, requiring 200,000 yuan to implement. However, raising such a large sum of money is not something that can be done immediately. Therefore, we have first selected urgent areas to build embankments for protection. A special estimate of the engineering plan has been prepared and sent for your review. We earnestly hope that you will raise relief funds to save this major disaster. Not only will the Han Mausoleum be protected, but the lives of the people in half of Mengjin County will also be entrusted to you.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Agricultural Society and Other Groups Oppose Jiangsu Province's Abolition of the Department of Industry <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Agricultural Society and other groups sent a telegram yesterday to the Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry, stating: To the esteemed Central Political Council of Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry: The Jiangsu Provincial Government suddenly decided to abolish the Department of Industry at the provincial government meeting on the 6th, merging it into the Department of Construction. We do not know on what laws of the National Government this is based. According to the Provincial Government Organization Law, the Central Political Council decides on the establishment or abolition of departments and the appointment or removal of committee members, which is submitted to the Executive Yuan and presented to the National Government for orders. Now, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, located near the seat of the National Government, can abolish a department and remove committee members with just a committee, replacing the functions and powers of the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan. If this precedent is set, it will inevitably lead to a situation of warlord separatism, making it difficult for central government orders to leave the capital, endangering the nation's position to an extreme degree. At the government meeting on the 9th, all provincial and county farms were uniformly suspended and personnel were dispatched for safekeeping. Since unification and return to the provinces, Jiangsu's agricultural administration has been on the right track, and the promotion of improvements has reached a certain scale. Local agricultural funding has increased to over 800,000 yuan, progressing in an orderly manner, and the results are becoming increasingly apparent. Enlightened individuals feel the importance of the food problem, establishing agricultural villages, giving lectures on promotion, striving to improve, and fearing being too late. Now, funding has been reduced to over 200,000 yuan, which is already severely damaging. Now, it is being completely abolished, and countless industries will be abandoned, and years of experimentation will be completely destroyed. This means that Jiangsu's agriculture, sericulture, cotton, fishery, animal husbandry, forestry, and mining will never have a chance to improve. Moreover, China is a nation founded on agriculture, and Jiangsu's wealth ranks first in the Southeast, relying on sericulture, rice, cotton, and fishing. There is no time to improve and maintain them. Once abolished, it is tantamount to digging one's own grave and destroying the foundation of the nation. The esteemed council, the executive yuan, and departments issue orders, supervise and direct, and have specialized responsibilities. We request that you promptly correct its illegality in accordance with the law, strictly order the cessation of its merger, and quickly restore the agricultural organizations that maintain the people's food supply, benefiting the farmers of Jiangsu and safeguarding the foundation of the nation. We cannot express our urgency and await your command. Sincerely, the Jiangsu Agricultural Society, Jiangsu Poultry Society, Jiangsu Beekeeping Society, Jiangsu Sericulture Society, Jiangbei Reclamation Promotion Association, Reclamation Research Society, and Jiangsu Rural Improvement Association.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Talk by Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenru Joint Transportation Station Plan</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, all buildings and equipment at the Shanghai North Station were destroyed by artillery fire. The Ministry of Railways has established a committee to plan and revive the construction of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways. It is reported that the plan is to set up a joint transportation station in Zhenru and a passenger terminal in Jiangwan. Recently, due to land use issues, local farmers, whose fields and houses have already suffered significant losses after the war, fear that their remaining land and houses will be requisitioned, leaving them with nothing to live on, and have been requesting exemptions. Reporters stationed in Beijing believe that this matter is of great importance to the revival of Shanghai's economy, and members of the community want to know the content of this plan. Recently, Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, returned to Beijing from Hankou, and reporters visited Mr. Gu at the Ministry of Railways to inquire about everything. He graciously received them immediately and gave the following answers. Below are the reporter's questions and Mr. Gu's answers.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Necessary Circumstances <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>(Question) Your ministry is reviving the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, and it is said that a joint transportation station will be set up in Zhenru and a passenger terminal in Jiangwan. What are the necessary circumstances for this? (Answer) The Shanghai Municipal Government previously promulgated the Shanghai Municipal Central Area Plan, proposing to set up a passenger terminal next to the West Zhongshan North Road in the city center, and a freight terminal to be moved out of the city along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, to the outskirts near Zhenru. It also believes that the existing North Station obstructs the traffic in Zhabei and advocates for its relocation. The ministry, considering the development of the municipality and the welfare of the public, and recognizing that the railway itself does indeed need to be relocated, decided to build a joint transportation station at the west of the intersection of Zhongshan Road and Jiaotong Road, occupying land on both the north and south sides of the current railway line, namely within the Zhenru and Pengpu areas. The passenger terminal will be set up in Jiangwan. (Question) After the war, vitality has not yet been restored. Why not simply restore the old appearance of the North Station on its original site and instead undertake such large-scale construction at this time? (Answer) The development of Shanghai's economy is extremely rapid. The existing station was planned thirty years ago. Compared to thirty years ago, Shanghai's population has increased and its commerce has prospered, making it vastly different. In terms of its location and facilities, it is no longer sufficient to meet current needs and must be relocated sooner or later. However, without the losses of war, it might still be possible to make do and muddle through. This destruction, although an extremely tragic and unfortunate event, is actually a new opportunity in terms of construction. Because the original station will eventually be forced by the general trend to relocate to a better location. If we temporarily follow the old ways, the losses from demolition and reconstruction after future repairs will be even greater. Therefore, it is better to resolutely and decisively take this opportunity to plan carefully and make a permanent solution. On the one hand, it can promote the progress of the railway and facilitate passenger and freight transport, and on the other hand, it can assist the development of the municipality and increase the welfare of the people.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Significance of Site Selection <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>(Question) Then what is the significance of choosing the location? (Answer) As mentioned earlier, the original North Station is not sufficient to meet current needs. Therefore, in order to remedy this deficiency and to adequately replace the North Station, the most suitable location is the sparsely populated area on the west side of Shanghai, which is convenient for the loading and unloading of passengers and freight, and is also close to the North Station. Therefore, the selection of the location and the design of the station are based on three principles: (1) It cannot be too far from the center of Shanghai; (2) The two railways must be conveniently connected, without losing their connection; (3) The future terminal must be set up in Jiangwan, taking into account the convenience of direct access to the terminal. Question: What is the design situation like? (Answer) The track layout of the North Station has always been difficult for trains to navigate, with many twists and turns. Since the joint transportation station has been decided, the current passenger trains will certainly use it as their terminus. However, after the passenger terminal is built in the future, there will be even more trains passing through. Therefore, this joint transportation station is designed according to the scale of a through station. The track layout includes many passing tracks, and each line is designed to be economical and practical. The facilities of the platforms and station buildings are mainly for the convenience of passengers. Also, in order to reduce shunting time, the locomotive shed and carriage shed are properly arranged so that after the train is unloaded at the platform, it can drive straight into the carriage shed. The locomotive can then drive forward from the carriage shed, pass through a curve, turn around, and drive into the locomotive shed. In the future, when the train departs for the return journey, it will not need to turn the locomotive around again. Once the design was finalized, the current selected location was chosen.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Area Occupied <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>(Question) Approximately how much land will the new plan occupy? (Answer) The area of land occupied is approximately 2,800 mu, of which approximately 150 mu are occupied by the roadbed, and the rest is necessary for track layout and various buildings. (Question) Why is so much land occupied? (Answer) The increase in railway business in recent years, the rapid development of Shanghai in the future, and the prosperity of the port will all progress rapidly. This plan is designed to meet the needs of the next fifty years, so the scale must be somewhat expanded. Furthermore, to facilitate passengers and merchants, in addition to the aforementioned station buildings, tracks, carriage sheds, and locomotive sheds, all freight yards, various offices, railway hotels, staff dormitories, and other railway-related buildings are arranged near the station buildings. Therefore, everything is considered to improve the work efficiency of employees and the convenience of business travelers. Therefore, this joint transportation station cannot be regarded as a current plan, and the land purchased is determined according to the required scope.</p>

<p>(Question) What are the procedures for demarcating the area and purchasing the land? (Answer) The ministry's purchase of this land is a national transportation undertaking, and all procedures should be carried out in accordance with the Land Expropriation Law promulgated and implemented by the National Government. (Question) How will the land be priced, and how will compensation be given for the attachments on the land? (Answer) The most fair land price will naturally be given for the land used. For the attachments on the land used, such as houses, graves, green crops, and trees, a corresponding relocation fee will also be given. At that time, the ministry will return to the Shanghai Municipal Government to investigate the local situation and will propose various prices and announce them in detail, consulting with the land owners to complete the purchase. (Question) What are the procedures for issuing land prices and relocation fees? (Answer) The ministry aims to make it convenient for the land owners. Once the price has been agreed upon, it is only necessary to complete the procedures for proving ownership before issuing the price.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Request to Higher Authorities <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>(Question) Currently, the villagers in the Zhenru expropriation zone are fiercely opposed. How will your ministry respond? (Answer) The railway construction plan aims to facilitate transportation for the entire society. Its focus is naturally different from the narrow-minded self-interest of individuals. We are very sympathetic to the losses of the farmers in Zhenru, such as flowers, gardens, and trees, which affect their lives. We will naturally do our best to find ways to alleviate their pain. In the event that the resistance is too great, and some members of society are unable to understand, rendering the ministry unable to achieve a comprehensive solution, then we will have no choice but to submit it to the higher authorities of the ministry to decide on a solution.</p>

<p>Advising the People of the Nation Not to Rely On or Be Dissatisfied with the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Only Way to Resolve the National Crisis Is to Strive for Self-Strengthening</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News visited Dr. Wu Chao-Shu, a member of the Central Committee, at his private residence and asked him to express his views on the League of Nations and how to deal with diplomacy. He said that he made a detailed observation and analysis of the League of Nations at the Peace Conference last year, because the League of Nations itself was not established for long, and it did not have the strength to sanction violence. It also made pleasing powerful nations its daily task. Therefore, it is extravagant to hope that it will have a good result for the Sino-Japanese dispute. In other words, if the League of Nations had the power to sanction violence, it would not have wanted to uphold justice. The resolution passed last year would have been implemented long ago. Therefore, the meetings and discussions of the League of Nations only serve to prolong the time, waiting for China to strive for its own liberation during this time. Therefore, the people of the nation should no longer rely on or be dissatisfied with the League of Nations, but should strengthen their military, enrich their internal affairs, increase their strength to resist Japan, and seek a new path of self-strengthening to resolve the national crisis.</p>

<p>A letter from Mr. Chang Chunsheng: I am a high school student who is about to graduate. Every day, I am busy with classes at school, listening to the indoctrination-style lectures of the teachers and reading mechanical textbooks, which makes me feel very bored. Looking at our country and society, corruption is rampant to an extreme degree. Foreign troubles are increasing, and the affairs of the nation remain the same. The corruption of society is getting worse day by day. It is truly hopeless! In this situation, I cannot see anyone who can truly take on the responsibility of saving the country and the people and purifying society. The future is truly unimaginable! In this situation, I truly feel the meaninglessness of life. Life is full of pain and has no joy. The future has no hope. What is the point of studying? I truly want to escape this corrupt society and this hopeless country! I truly do not know what I should do! Your newspaper is the guide for the people of the whole country. The gentlemen are knowledgeable and experienced. You are willing to take the time to guide young people who are as troubled as I am. Therefore, I dare to ask for your guidance, hoping that you will not abandon me and teach me. That would be very fortunate!</p>
<p>Reply: According to your letter, there are two reasons why you are feeling troubled. One is because you do not feel interested in the "indoctrination-style lectures" and "mechanical textbooks." The other is because you feel that "the country and society are corrupt and rotten" and that "nothing can be done." Your ability to feel this kind of trouble has already proven that you are a thoughtful young person, at least not a person who is simply living in a drunken dream. You are already looking for a way out. We believe that in your constant search, you will definitely find the right path.</p>
<p>Examining the two reasons that are causing you trouble, the former is very simple. Perhaps the instructor's method is not effective and cannot arouse the interest of the students, or perhaps you have your own thoughts and do not feel interested in the rigid classroom life. But the blame does not lie in the "mechanical nature of the textbooks." If you can use the mechanical textbooks in a lively way and integrate knowledge and action, in other words, if you use your brain in the classroom and then use your hands to experiment outside the classroom, you will definitely realize that "textbooks" are not "mechanical" and that "studying is not a "hard thing."</p>
<p>Regarding the latter, this is naturally a very serious problem facing our nation. Internal strife and foreign troubles are tormenting us. In this situation, I think that as long as one is not willing to live in a drunken dream, there is no one who does not deeply feel pain and trouble.</p>
<p>However, we believe that this problem cannot be solved by feeling troubled. Trouble can only kill yourself and plunge our nation into greater darkness and hopelessness. At the same time, we also believe that only the brave are willing to stand in front of the problem, and only the brave can seek answers from the problem. As long as the Chinese people are willing to stand in front of the problem and not avoid it, and are also willing to seek answers from the problem, then China will definitely not be without hope. Even Korea and India, whose countries have been destroyed and whose people have been enslaved, their surviving remnants of their perished nations have not given up hope for their countries and are still constantly fighting. How much more is this true for our country, which has not yet fallen into the tragic situation of Korea and India?</p>
<p>You are a young person, and also a student youth. You are the future master of our country. In other words, the problems of our country are placed on your shoulders. There is no way, you must think of a way. There is no way out, you must think of a way out. You should not avoid the problem, you should not shirk responsibility, you should not wait for others. Troubled? Trouble can only kill yourself and send our country on a path of death that is truly unsolvable.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter what, you should not be troubled. Stand bravely in front of the problem, find a way out of the difficulties, there are many people seeking a way out, as long as you have the determination, you will definitely find your companions.</p>
<p>When there is "truly no way," there will "be a way." History will not deceive people. Why are you troubled?</p>
<p>A letter from Mr. Gao Qian'an: In recent years, the morals of the world have deteriorated day by day, and morality has declined. News of rape, murder, theft, and adultery fills the newspapers, almost making people suspect that newspapers are specifically published to record the evils of society. Looking back on the past, in times of chaos and famine, there were also many cases of murder, robbery, and fighting, but the world has never been filled with bandits as much as it is today. The reason for this is the harm caused by the abandonment of ritual education and the prevalence of evil theories. The loyal gentlemen of today only know how to call and run around to resist insults and save the nation, but they do not know that the morals of the world and the hearts of the people are like this, the lifeblood of the country has been cut off, and even without the arrival of strong bandits, it will eventually perish. Without understanding the fundamentals, their actions will be ineffective. Therefore, in my opinion, saving the nation must start with saving the morals of the world and the hearts of the people, and the rope and discipline of ritual education are especially critical to survival. Otherwise, even if one has the power to turn the tide, it will eventually be futile. Do you gentlemen think so? Your newspaper is the leader of society and has the responsibility of correcting the hearts of the people. I deeply hope that your newspaper will lead the way in saving this decadent world.</p>
<p>Reply: Your letter expresses great concern about the worsening of the morals of the world and the hearts of the people today, and the world being filled with bandits, which is a feeling that we all share. However, I cannot agree with your letter's attribution of the cause to the abandonment of ritual education and the prevalence of evil theories, and your desire to maintain the rope and discipline of ritual education as a way to save the morals of the world and the hearts of the people and to save the country in danger. The ancients once said: "If the people are rich, they cannot be employed with emoluments; if they are poor, they cannot be punished with punishments. The laws are not enforced, and the people are not well-governed, because of the inequality of wealth." It is also said: "In all ways of governing a country, it is necessary to enrich the people first. If the people are rich, they are easy to govern; if the people are poor, they are difficult to govern." "When the granaries are full, they know etiquette; when they are well-fed and clothed, they know honor and shame." It can be seen that the reason why China has become a bandit world today is because "the people cannot make a living," not because of the prevalence of evil theories. Modern sociologists who study the source of evil mostly attribute it to economic relations. Even those that are due to heredity are caused by society. Therefore, it is not only murder and robbery that are caused by the oppression of life, but also other crimes are due to the bad social system. The prevalence of evil proves the bankruptcy of society and the exhaustion of the people's livelihood. Therefore, we are deeply concerned about the morals of the world and the hearts of the people in China today, but what we should focus on is not the latter but the former. If we do not investigate the true cause and only lament the rope and discipline of ritual education, we are truly abandoning the root and pursuing the branch, and we will only have lamentation forever.</p>
<p>For excessive self-defense, a public prosecution was filed. However, it was also inappropriate for the deceased police officer to carry weapons in plain clothes. Therefore, after the interrogation, the member of the corps was released on bail. However, when the debate concluded the other day, the court suddenly detained the defendant and refused to allow bail. Therefore, all the businesses and people in Pudong expressed their dissatisfaction, believing that the member of the corps was falsely accused for public service, which was a matter of concern to everyone. Therefore, the citizens of Pudong convened an emergency meeting of representatives of all businesses at the Tangqiao District Self-Defense Corps at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss rescue measures. Over a hundred representatives attended, and the chairman reported the incident that day, stating that the deceased police officer was suspected of plotting a robbery. After discussion, it was believed that the member of the corps was indeed falsely accused for public service and must be rescued. In addition to informing all sectors of the facts and requesting unanimous assistance, it was also decided to request the Municipal Self-Defense Corps to uphold justice.</p>

<p>[Educational News Highlights: Su Education Commissioner Zhou Fohai Inspects Northern Jiangsu (8) L]</p>
<p>Visited Rugao Middle School in the morning and gave a lengthy talk.</p>
<p>Convened a meeting with the entire city's education community in the evening.</p>
<p>(Rugao Correspondent) This morning, on the 7th, at 8:00 AM, Education Commissioner Zhou Fohai and his party continued their educational inspection. They first went to Rugao County Middle School, where Principal Xu guided them on a tour of the school's facilities and observed classes such as geometry and Chinese language. Mr. Zhou inspected and provided guidance one by one, and then went to inspect everything in the school's girls' division. At 11:00 AM, they went to Anding Elementary School to inspect the teaching of children at all levels in great detail and provided many instructions. They returned to their residence for lunch at noon (because they declined all social engagements). At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, they went to Rugao Middle School to give a speech, stating that Rugao Normal School is a provincial school and should strive to be a model for all public and private schools. Regarding the three aspects of discipline, thought, and level, efforts should be made to improve them. The direction of improvement lies in seeking personal survival and serving society in order to cultivate truly useful talents. There are three conditions for this: first, rich knowledge; second, a sound personality; and third, correct thinking. Mr. Zhou explained these three aspects in great detail and elaborated on them thoroughly, and said that students must study and must have real knowledge in order to resist Japan and save the country. He also stated that Rugao customs are prone to litigation, and the education community often engages in anonymous posters, which is not a bright and upright attitude. In the future, students should be careful not to contract this bad habit. The spirit of national virtues such as loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, peace, and so on should be promoted and the spirit of the great country should be carried forward. It is also necessary to obey the orders of teachers, abide by discipline, value order, and restore the true view of respecting teachers and valuing the Way. He cited the deeds and learning style of Hu Angong, a great Confucian scholar of the Song Dynasty in Rugao, as an example, and encouraged them. Finally, he corrected the psychology of arrogance in senior students and deeply repented of the reckless release of ideas by normal school students. In the future, school management must adopt strict doctrines. Teachers and staff can strictly manage students. If teachers and staff can strictly manage students, then they will be good teachers and students, and students can receive strict management from teachers and staff. The explanation was thorough and detailed, and all 300 teachers and students present were moved. The speech lasted for one and a half hours before it ended. Principal Shen led them to the playground for a group photo. That night at 8:00 PM, he went to the county party headquarters auditorium to convene a meeting with the education community of the entire city. More than 200 people attended. Mr. Zhou said that Rugao education has three undesirable phenomena: first, factions; second, lack of funding; and third, lack of vitality, that is, chaos, poverty, theft, and exhaustion. The reorganization of Rugao education is nothing more than planning, funding, and talent, three points. (1) In terms of planning, do not aim too high or be overly ambitious, but be realistic and able to achieve it. The Education Bureau should be ordered to re-formulate a detailed and concrete plan and submit it for review and approval. (2) In terms of funding, there are three methods: one is to increase revenue, the second is to reorganize, and the third is to reduce expenditure. In terms of increasing revenue, the Education Department has already raised overdue fines, which can generate more than 10,000 yuan per year. Miscellaneous donations and land rents can all be reorganized, and taxes should be collected promptly. There are also three ways to reduce expenditure: first, unnecessary agencies and personnel should be laid off with drastic measures; second, redundant positions should be merged; and third, internal measures should be taken to tighten spending. (3) In terms of talent, if A overthrows B and A takes over, it is not possible in fact, and even if it is, it is not good. If they fight each other, they will both be harmed. The best way is to work together to eliminate factions. As for how to reorganize Rugao education, the Education Department will send several supervisors to Rugao to assist the local authorities in implementing it thoroughly. Within three years, Rugao's education will surely be successful. He returned to his residence at 10:30 PM and is scheduled to attend a speech at the County Middle School at 8:00 AM tomorrow (the 8th), and then go to Tangjia Zha to visit the Dasheng Yarn Factory and other places, and then transfer to Shanghai and Beijing that evening to attend the Third Plenary Session.</p>
<p>(4) Physical ability: This refers to innate ability. The relationship between this ability and physical education is the same as the relationship between intelligence and other subjects. However, there is currently no uniform standard for physical ability testing in the physical education field. Most of the tests used by schools are not formulated according to scientific methods. A relatively reliable criterion is the Brace Physical Ability Test (reference), BraceDKMeaurngMolorAbilityASBarnesCoNewYork. However, it is still necessary to have a spirit of research when applying it.</p>
<p>(5) Skills: This refers to the ability acquired through learning. The methods for testing skills can be divided into universal and special types. For example, selecting five, six, or ten natural movements from various sports activities, such as running, jumping, throwing, and throwing, can be used as a universal skill test. Simple machines can also be used for testing, such as physical strength tests. As for special tests, each sport has its own tests. For example, basketball can use the following tests: (1) free throw; (2) accurate shooting, receiving, and passing; (3) dribbling and shooting; (4) free shooting; (5) passing distance. The following are five grading methods, (1) and (2) are absolutely indispensable, and the remaining three should also be fully adopted. If it feels difficult, at least one must be selected. The following three examples are for reference:</p>
<p>(Note) The relationship between grade level and academic performance is very close, but the current general grading method often ignores it. It must be known that this grading standard can also enable each grade to obtain its corresponding teaching results.</p>
<p>(Example 1) Breaking the Ordinary Grade System</p>
<p>Step 1: Divide the students in each grade into two groups, male and female, according to gender.</p>
<p>Step 2: Divide the first-grade boys and girls into groups according to the results of physical examinations. Those who need special corrective activities are divided into one group, called the "Zi" group. Then, the remaining students are divided into "Chou = Yin" groups according to physical ability or skill test, or a combination of the two. Those below 30% or 40% of the whole grade are in the "Chou" group, and the rest are in the "Yin" group.</p>
<p>Step 3: Divide the second and third grade boys and girls according to Step 2, but divide the students who do not need correction into three groups, or those below the lowest 25% or 30% are in the "Chou" group, those above the highest 25% or 30% are in the "Mao" group, and the rest in the middle are in the "Yin" group.</p>
<p>Step 4: Combine the groups divided in Steps 2 and 3. Zi and Zi are combined into Group A, Chou and Chou are combined into Group B, Yin and Yin are combined into Group C, and Mao is Group D. Thus, all the boys and girls in the school are divided into four groups: A, B, C, and D.</p>
<p>Step 5: If there are many students and more than one teacher, the above four groups can still be divided into several groups as follows:</p>

<p>The registration of overseas Chinese schools used to be handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was a cumbersome procedure. Since 1929, the administrative regulations for overseas Chinese education managed by consuls have been jointly agreed upon by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. According to the regulations, the establishment of overseas Chinese schools is directly reported to the Ministry of Education by the consul. The Ministry of Education sends a letter to seek the consent of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the Ministry of Education directly orders the consulate to approve the registration. Each month, the Ministry of Education informs the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the overseas Chinese schools approved for registration in that month for record. The overseas Chinese schools approved for registration by the Ministry of Education in September, October, and November are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) In September, there were two schools: Zhenhua Elementary School (Ipoh, British Malaya) and Qunying Elementary School (Mangjie, Vietnam). (2) In October, there were two schools: Guangming Elementary School (Penang) and Busan Overseas Chinese Elementary School (Busan). (3) In November, there was one school: Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Middle School (Hong Kong).</p>

<p>The Dadong Bookstore Home Education Lecture was broadcasted on the Zhongxi Pharmacy No-Money Radio Station. Yesterday, it was Chief Editor Da Hu Du Yi of the Children's Morning News who spoke on "Children's Protection of Things." The main idea was that children's reading materials can certainly benefit children, but sometimes they can also be naturally harmful. Therefore, we must first look at whether the children's reading materials can provide correct and accurate knowledge, and then see if they conform to children's psychology. At the same time, there are also two major questions: first, what do children really like? Second, how should we create children's reading materials? These two questions are the central questions in children's reading materials. If we can thoroughly understand them, then the selection, guidance, and so on of children's reading materials can all be solved easily. It is said that today Zhang Yaoxiang will be speaking on "The Life of Our Country's Children."</p>

<p>Among the subsidies issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council to private schools in the concession, there is an item for the construction costs of the Hudong Commune. The Health Department and the Finance Department have now notified the Education Department that they are allowed to issue the fees for the first three quarters of this year to improve sanitation conditions. In addition, the subsidies for five schools will be issued after they have moved to suitable school sites, as advocated by the Health Department. Moreover, the Chairman of the Education Committee found that the situations of Jing'an Elementary School and Shanghai Elementary School were similar, so the fees for these two schools will also be temporarily suspended. In addition, there are six schools that the Health Department has reported as not being very satisfactory, but the Health Department has not advocated suspending the subsidies. Therefore, the Chairman of the Education Committee proposed that the fees for these six schools for this quarter should be issued as usual, but at the same time, it was stated that if sanitation conditions are not improved, the payments will be stopped in the next quarter. After discussion, this proposal was passed, and the Director of the Chinese Education Department solemnly informed the principals of the six schools of this intention. The council's proposal has been approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Shanghai College sent a letter stating: "Dear Mr. Editor, in today's Education News column of your newspaper, there is a news item about second-year students of the private Shanghai College petitioning against Zhou and refusing to attend classes. After investigation, it was found that the Chinese language teacher for the first year was Mr. Hu Jingzhi. During the period when Mr. Hu was unable to come to school due to illness, he repeatedly asked people to substitute for him. There was indeed a Mr. Zhou. Since December, Mr. Hu has taken another job, and we were unable to retain him, so the general affairs director, Mr. Yang Daohong, concurrently assumed the position. During the change, more than a dozen students were used by others to drop out of school voluntarily, but the class has never been suspended for a single lesson. The so-called second-year class strike is completely fictitious. The students who dropped out of school have been repeatedly disciplined, but they have stubbornly refused to change their minds. We had no choice but to remove them from the school register to maintain discipline. In the past two days, the parents of the students came to the school and pleaded for the revocation of the decision. For the sake of cherishing the studies of young people, the school gave them a chance to reform themselves and allowed them to remain in school under observation. The facts are clear. We are deeply afraid that the public will misunderstand, so we are sending this letter to request a correction and express our gratitude."</p>

<h3 id="e145">8,000 Fans Pleasantly Surprised as Donghua Overwhelms Argyll <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Jia League Match</p>
<p>Donghua Scores Three Goals First, Argyll Recovers One</p>
<p>Although Argyll Was Defeated, Their Skill Was Indeed Amazing</p>
<p>A Spectacular Performance This Season</p>
<p>The 8,000 fans at the football field yesterday were pleasantly surprised. The Donghua Football Team was in great luck, defeating the Argyll Football Team of the Scottish Army, which had been dominating Shanghai, by a score of 3-1. The score was 2-0 in the first half and 3-0 in the second half before Argyll added a goal. The match was truly a contest between evenly matched opponents, and the outcome depended entirely on luck. However, although Argyll lost, it seemed to be a notch above Donghua in skill. The spectacular performance was the best seen this season. The referee was Ballard.</p>
<p>Donghua Team Lineup:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Kai Xun'an, Tu Kaiyuan, Feng Yunyou, Wu Youliang, Wan Xianghua, Chen Hongguang, Li Yichen, Chen Jiaqiu, Cao Qiuting</p>
<p>Argyll Lineup:</p>
<p>Henry, Tau, Que Dou, Hai Si, De Yu, Men Hai Shi, Gra Xin, Hughes, Quitte, Krag, Taylor, Hui Lies</p>
<h3 id="e146">Incredibly Spectacular, A Sight to Behold <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>It was expected that elite troops would meet strong opponents and the performance would be exciting. Argyll came to Shanghai as a substitute for Hamed Shah and showed their skills twice. In the first Jia League match, they defeated Lacks 6-2. In the second Skota Cup match, they thrashed Yiling 10-0 in two weeks. Judging from their performance, it was clear that they were not to be trifled with. The advance of their five forwards was as fast as lightning, their passing was skilled and ingenious, and the accuracy of their hooking shots on both wings was rarely seen at sea. Their crosses from both corners were accurate to the millimeter, a sight to behold. The defense was also steady. The only shortcoming was that the backs were occasionally careless and made mistakes. The Western Police team was probably not as good as them. Although they were defeated, it can be said that their luck was bad. The missed scoring opportunities can only be blamed on themselves. In terms of performance, they were still a notch above Donghua.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Good Luck Prevails, Unstoppable <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Donghua knew the strength of the enemy, so it issued a special order for strict precautions. Although they broke through the enemy's goal twice in the first half, their own goal was almost a place for the enemy to enter and exit at will, with endless turmoil. Fortunately, good luck prevailed, and all dangers were averted. Li Ning defended the left and looked after the right. If he relaxed even slightly, there would have been a disaster. The entire army was unusually careful in its operations, making the performance twice as exciting as in the past, which is evident.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Dangerous, Dangerous with Opportunities Missed <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Donghua's victory was truly a stroke of good fortune. The front of the goal was surrounded by a tight siege, but the ball could not be scored. After Donghua scored the first goal against Argyll, the enemy forwards launched repeated attacks. Once, Qin Feixu dribbled past Li Ning and passed lightly to the center. Krag shot straight at the goal from three feet away, but the ball went wide and missed. Tu Kaiyuan committed a foul, and Hai Men took a penalty kick, which also flew out of the goal. There were countless other dangerous balls like these. Among Argyll's forwards, there was a left inner, Raymond, who was excellent at both attacking and shooting and had fast feet. He was absent yesterday and replaced by Quitte, otherwise the situation might have been different.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Unexpectedly, They Scored a Goal First <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Ballard, the strict referee, ordered the kickoff. Within five minutes, Donghua launched several attacks, but all failed. Tu Kaiyuan passed the ball on the left, Wan Xianghua got it and advanced, passing the ball to the center. In this urgent situation, Hai Si eventually lost his footing, and Li Yichen intercepted the ball and kicked it hard, the ball was strong enough, and it went into the net. Donghua opened the scoring first, and the fans exploded with cheers that had not been heard for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Overjoyed, Penalty Kick Missed <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Scottish army counterattacked, but although the attack was fierce, the defense was also strict, and they could not get close to the goal. When Taylor Hui Lies passed the ball, he was forced to clear the ball, which happened to fall in front of the goal. They held on for three or four minutes before finally getting out of danger, which was also fortunate. However, the enemy's momentum was still strong, and the right wing was even more valiant, constantly probing the border. After another corner kick, Hui Lies got the ball on the right corner and advanced towards the goal. Tu Kaiyuan went to defend, and his hand touched the ball. Like a bolt from the blue, an unexpected penalty kick was awarded. Hai Shi kicked it, and the Scottish army had tried to score several times, knowing the iron gate's skill. The ball went to the right, turning ingenuity into clumsiness, and went out of the goal. The Donghua players hugged each other in great joy, almost going crazy.</p>
<h3 id="e151">A Sudden Counterattack, Instead, Scores <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The disaster was turned into nothing, and the entire army counterattacked. Chen Hongguang passed to the center, Li Yichen passed to the right wing, and Cao Qiuting rushed up like a flying horse. Tau Que Dou saw that he had already caused trouble, so he hooked his foot. Ballard caught a glimpse of it and immediately awarded another penalty kick. Chen Jiaqiu sent the ball in with a bang, turning misfortune into fortune. Donghua really did not expect it. In Argyll's case, if this penalty kick had been scored, they would not have been penalized. This penalty kick, one in and one out, totaled two goals. Everyone knew that Argyll had lost. After that, although Argyll's momentum was overwhelming, many dangerous balls were blocked by the iron gate. The first half ended 2-0.</p>
<h3 id="e152">One Fell Swoop, Three Goals in a Row <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Argyll lost two goals in a row. From the beginning of the second half, they continued to counterattack in an effort to retaliate. However, although the attack was fierce, it was still useless. Donghua then went deep into the enemy's territory, reaching the Scottish army's goal. Wan Xianghua crossed and Chen Hongguang headed the ball, which fell from high to low. The goalkeeper Henry and Si De jumped up to compete, but the ball was not caught and fell into the net at that moment, making it 3-0.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Endless Turmoil in Front of the Iron Gate <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Argyll was in a situation of utter defeat and still continued to make persistent efforts, their courage commendable. Hai Shi received the ball and shot very urgently. The goalkeeper caught it but failed, dodging. The ball hit Wu Youliang's foot again, escaping danger. Then, Donghua was penalized for a foul in front of the goal. Hughes kicked the ball, which happened to be in Zhou Xianyan's hand. Taifei Xu shot at the goal in the chaos, thinking it would definitely go in, but it hit the goalpost and bounced back. Fortunately, Donghua, Hughes got a corner kick on the left, and Quitte headed the ball in, which was clear and spectacular, but the referee ruled that he had hit someone in the middle of the recording, so the goal was invalid.</p>
<h3 id="e154">A Desperate Gamble, Reclaiming One Goal <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>In the last five minutes, Argyll took a desperate gamble in the hope of reversing the situation of the entire army being wiped out, rushing towards Donghua's goal. Sure enough, Quitte took a long shot from 25 yards away. The iron gate thought it was a high ball that would go over the net and did not pounce, but unexpectedly it fell into the goal, making it 3-1 at the end of the game.</p>

<p>Among the matches, the match between the National Group's Third Team and Shanghai Qing was the most exciting. The strength of both sides was equal, and the scoring opportunities were comparable, but the goalkeeper of Shanghai Qing was slightly weaker, conceding five goals, which was also unfortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Research on Football Tactics (I) <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Written in Response to the First Defeat of the Gunli Team in Batavia</p>
<p>After Li Junhuitang went to Batavia in the South Seas to do business, he never abandoned his football life. He and Cheng Lin also worked for the Chinese football team Gunli in that area. The team was very strong, unbeatable, and held the title of the local alliance leader. Unexpectedly, last week, they lost 0-2 to the Ali Feifei team. Li Jun felt that the unexpected defeat was due to the abnormality of luck, but felt that there was great value in researching tactics, so he wrote "Research on Football Tactics". Although it was published to seek future improvements for Gunli's failure, it is also worthy of reference for other football teams. The following is specially disclosed so that the Shanghai Chinese team and the domestic football community will pay attention to it (Editor).</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. It seems like a week has passed in an instant since Gunli suffered its first defeat this season. Originally, I wanted to write an article a few days ago, but I was a little busy with my recent appointment at the China Anbao Life Insurance Company and could not spare the time. I have delayed it until now before I can talk to you all. I hope everyone will not regard it as yesterday's news.</p>
<p>Gunli held the temporary alliance leader's fortress for only two weeks before it was destroyed by two shells from Ali Feifei and surrendered to others. In fact, what is there to talk about after a defeat? People will suspect that I am making excuses, relying on others, and shirking responsibility. But I have no such thoughts at all. I firmly believe that we were not unlucky that day, and I do not admit that the referee had any biased behavior, nor dare I say that the performance of our participants that day was completely abnormal, Off Form (I believe everyone has done their best, but the horse may not advance). If I say further that Ali Feifei won by luck, that is even more absurd. According to the situation and playing style that time, their victory was well deserved. To be honest, if Gunli's measures that day could have defeated Ali Feifei, I would not have been able to compliment them very much, because the strategies we adopted for responding to the enemy and attacking and defending were completely contrary to the truth. Even if the two teams played ten more games, if both sides still used the formation and tactics of that day, Gunli's hope of victory would probably only account for two or three out of ten. From this, it can be seen that the mystery and change of football are infinite. You cannot say that a strong team can definitely beat a weak team (everyone recognizes that Gunli is stronger), nor can you insist that a certain offensive and defensive method can succeed every time. Although the goddess of luck sometimes has a few latent controlling powers over victory and defeat in a football match (not a very common component), we must not completely rely on or complain about the goddess of luck. We must have a constant research, a "temporary change", "wisdom and common sense in the game", and "good methods and skills that can be adapted to the environment at any time". Only with these treasures can we often control the chances of winning. These treasures should be personal belongings that everyone in the team has. As soon as they are needed, they can be taken out immediately. Otherwise, it is really difficult for a large battlefield to cooperate. No matter how many talented people there are in your team, it is useless if they do not respond to each other, let alone that others are not completely powerless.</p>
<p>From here, let me first talk about the reasons for our frustration. The formation adopted by Ali Feifei that day is called the "Middle Road Blocking Defense Genre Blocking Defense". Their intention was only to prevent us from winning, and as for whether their forwards could build a career, they listened to the opportunity. They knew that I and my old partner A Dai Linjing were the most active and dangerous people, so they used three or four people to monitor them (very strict monitoring, even more severe than watching prisoners), in order to contain our front line. They believed that this kind of formation and strategy was very refined and wonderful and would definitely be effective (yes, in the end, they really relied on Gunli to break through the formation without defense and succeed). But in my opinion, that kind of formation is not a good one. The so-called sitting in a city will eventually lead to death. However, they were fortunate enough to encounter the current Gunli team, which had no ability to break this kind of formation. Otherwise, if a team that can use a scattered attack method, Odenupof Oenfense, they have no reason not to lose. I believe that their back often ignores the attacks on both wings, and only cares about retreating in the middle, which is no different from leading a wolf into the room, the next best policy (Fortunately, the wolves were not very fierce that day. If we had a pair of side generals like Ye Beihua and Cao Guicheng, carrying the ball all the way to the end line, and then throwing the ball high from above in front of the enemy's goal and doing it again and again, it would not be difficult to get things done and achieve good results. But that day, the centering skills of our side generals were very disappointing. They were either mistaken in time or mistaken in the standard, feeling tired back and forth, giving the enemy guards a good opportunity to create heroes. Secondly, the ball supply skills of the three central guards, Centering, also have a lot of room for improvement. The most obvious weakness is that after getting the ball, they cannot use wonderful passes to supply the forwards (although the ball is won wonderfully, the ball supply is not good, it is futile and time-consuming, and the chopping skills are still lacking. Feeding Cnop (chopping is a ball that is only slightly above people's heads. It is best to transmit it to your own forward when the enemy is trying to seize it in front of you. It is one of the most suitable kicking methods for the central guard.) Like that day, when you saw that the middle road was too tightly entangled, you should not still stubbornly stick to one hard road and make progress in the middle, causing blockage. You should carry the ball to a suitable place after getting the ball, or lure one of the enemy guards to seize it, and use the chopping method to transmit it to both wings and develop from the periphery to disrupt the enemy's formation. However, that day, the chopping-style kicking method and long pass, and the steps of the two wings were not often seen in the entire dike. Therefore, the enemy's suitable plan took the opportunity to be sold, and they still stationed a heavy army in the middle road regardless of other brothers. Although in fact there were more attacks and fewer defenses, because they could not find a way to lure the enemy to disperse, the opportunity for the forwards to shoot was reduced and they were unable to succeed, but were instead attacked by them twice. Therefore, according to the battle situation that day, to sum up, it is not so much that Ali Feifei's forwards won the ball, Tian Ning said that Ali Feifei's back won, and it is not so much that Ali Feifei overthrew Gunli, but rather that Gunli itself overthrew Gunli. The reasons for our failure are nothing more than the following: (1) The centering skills of both wings were not proper; (2) The supply of the ball in the center could not be changed according to the situation; (3) Since I and A Dai were seriously monitored, the team still often thought of giving the ball to the two of us, and no one outside of the two of us really had the ability to shoot; (4) Under the fierce attack, the back forgot its position, and after the enemy's forward got the ball, it took advantage of the emptiness to succeed.</p>
<p>Now, although things have passed, if we do not seek to cheer up after a failure, it is great cowardice. What's more, it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. The future of the championship is unlimited. The materials of our team, Malenrial, are not inferior, and anyone is a good material that can be created. The general requirement is that the person himself is willing to carefully ponder, accept with humility, adopt and avoid shortcomings, and work hard. According to my observation, the teammates of Gunli are not a generation of stubborn stones that "can neither command nor be commanded". Everyone must know that if you want to enjoy a great name in everything, it cannot be achieved overnight. Great name and success cannot be brought with you from the womb. Although sometimes art can create heroes, a person "only can create himself" and must not be willing to be a coward who relies solely on luck or the times to patronize (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>The others, hearing this, seemed to think of their own affairs and slowly dispersed. Da Fa returned to his sleeping place and kicked San De hard out of irritation. San De, like a pig, did not wake up and just fell back asleep.</p>
<p>He then had another dream.</p>
<p>When he woke up from this strange dream, someone was kicking him violently. Thinking that they were the people who were going to arrest him, he jumped up suddenly, opened his eyes wide, and saw a black man in coarse cloth, holding a bamboo carrying pole. The man, caught off guard by Da Fa's sudden jump, was also startled and opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p>"Pig, are you crazy?... I'm going to do business, why are you still lying here?"</p>
<p>Da Fa saw a load of small green vegetables next to the carrying pole. He looked further and saw many large baskets and crates filled with goods, and several small stalls, the wooden frames of which were hung with pork and beef. Everyone was busy organizing their own baskets or stalls. He also saw San De wiping his face with a blue cloth coat, looking quite energetic.</p>
<p>"There was a shooting in the middle of the night to catch robbers. I ran to watch. I don't know if the robbers were caught, but someone died senselessly while they were changing locations."</p>
<p>"Don't let them mistake you for a robber," San De said coldly.</p>
<p>"I pushed you a few times, wanting to call you to go and see, but you slept like a pig. How could I wake you up?"</p>
<p>"It's a good thing I didn't wake up. If I had really been woken up by you, I would have broken your bones."</p>
<p>As he was saying this, San De had already put on his clothes and was about to leave when he felt a cold, wet sensation under his feet, which angered him. He looked down and saw a slow stream of water flowing over his feet. Looking back, he knew where the water came from. The man who had kicked Da Fa a couple of times had placed a large basket of vegetables next to a pipe. Clean water flowed from the pipe, and the water that washed over the vegetables flowed straight down the stone slab from under the basket, soaking San De's feet. He was about to shout in anger, but when he saw the good, clean water, he pulled Da Fa and walked over together. The vegetable seller turned a small device, and the water stopped flowing. Da Fa asked in surprise:</p>
<p>"What is this? This thing is really good."</p>
<p>"This is tap water."</p>
<p>The two of them washed their hands and faces. Their hands felt very refreshed, but their faces still didn't feel quite right. They couldn't put their faces directly under the pipe, so they joined their palms together, forming a large bowl, waited for it to fill with water, and then rubbed it on their faces. Then they drank a lot of water in the same way before walking away happily.</p>
<p>This street was now very different from yesterday. Now, both sides were piled high with vegetables. In some places, there were also small baskets selling snacks, with pieces of square cakes and triangular white rice cakes steaming with soft heat, as well as piles of cooked noodles. They stood for a while and saw several peddlers sitting by a long bench, paying a few copper coins for a bowl of noodles. The noodles were only seasoned with soy sauce and sesame oil, but they looked like a high-quality dish.</p>
<p>With no hope of buying anything from these stalls, they mingled with the crowd of shoppers. More and more women carrying small baskets slowly appeared, sniffing at the various goods like dogs. A chaotic mix of sounds, along with the fishy and meaty smells of various items, entered their ears and noses, and the various goods also attracted their eyes. There were tiny heads of small green vegetables, chicken greens, large eggplants, pods of edamame, and many other things that they had at home, things they had planted themselves. Now, everything seemed very precious, and they wished they could reach out and grab a handful, which would surely taste good even eaten raw.</p>
<p>San De and Da Fa both thought this. It would be great if they could steal such a handful. If the person saw them and made a fuss, they would just return it. But San De saw a well-dressed woman also buying vegetables in the crowd, so he thought that after these people bought good things, it would be much fairer to reach into their baskets to steal than to steal from the peddlers. Because Da Fa was thinking about his hometown that had been flooded, he stood blankly next to a tofu stall, not even seeing his companion carefully eyeing many small baskets.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Dream <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Han Xing</p>
<p>In this world, we have never seen a "perfect person." Therefore, whether you are poor or rich, whether you are a commoner or a great figure, whether you are a child or an old person, as long as you close your eyes and sleep soundly, you will dream.</p>
<p>According to Freud's analysis, dreams are the result of repressed subconscious desires taking over when a person's conscious mind is asleep and loses control. These desires, which are usually suppressed because they are longed for but cannot be satisfied, are disguised and acted out in various forms. From this, we can know that only dreams are truly free. When you are sound asleep, you can instantly become a millionaire, instantly become a high-ranking official, kiss the young man or woman you adore, or kill the enemies you hate. You can ride the wind and soar through the sky, or float on the water and bob on the sea.</p>
<p>In short, there are no laws, morals, customs, or any other restraints or restrictions here. Your consciousness can run wild like an untamed horse, and you can satisfy everything you hope for but cannot achieve.</p>
<p>A young boy or girl often has rosy dreams, a businessman often has dreams of getting rich, and a politician often has dreams of rising to prominence. However, many people often have nightmares, dreams of revenge, such as when a group of starving and freezing slaves stretch out their legs and lie haphazardly in a dark underground room after a day of fatigue. Can you know what kind of dreams they are having?</p>
<p>Only in dreams are we truly free, and we can be whatever we imagine. Therefore, smart people are often dreaming, sometimes even daydreaming. For example, smart people say that justice can eventually overcome power, or that puppets can eventually come to life. Even if this is just a "dream," children, can you be sure that it won't become a reality in the "future future"?</p>
<h3 id="e162">The True Face of a Man <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Wan Zhen</p>
<p>When a man is in the process of courtship, his words and actions are truly pitiful and laughable. When he prepares to see his beloved, he has to groom himself for a long time like a so-called young lady in her boudoir—shaving, applying cold cream, spraying hair water, combing his hair sleekly, polishing his leather shoes until they shine, and then changing into a brand new outfit, tugging and pulling to tie his tie properly. Finally, he inserts a beautiful little silk handkerchief into the small pocket on his chest. Then, shrugging his shoulders, twisting his neck, looking left and right, he strides out.</p>
<p>But as soon as he sees his beloved, he instantly transforms the lively, dashing, and complacent attitude he had on the way into nothingness. Now, he is as frightened and cautious as a subject seeing his king or a servant seeing his master, waiting for orders with his hands at his sides. When he speaks, he always puts on a smiling face, diligently compliments her, and does everything he can. If he sees his beloved looking unhappy, he hangs his head in despair as if he has committed a crime, unable to sit or stand still, unable to eat or sleep, completely at a loss. When he sees his beloved smile, he is as joyful and elated as a prisoner being pardoned or a dried-up fish being returned to water. In order to achieve the goal of being loved, he will say to his beloved in a pleading and sighing tone: "I don't pursue anything in the world. My only wish is to be your servant, your slave, forever. I want to live for you, die for you, I wish..." How pitiful and sweet-sounding it is!</p>
<p>After love is sought and the goal is achieved, he is still very gentle and docile during this period. He is extremely concerned and considerate about everything his beloved does. If his beloved wants him to go up the mountain, he will go up the mountain; if she wants him to go into the water, he will go into the water. If his beloved wants this, he will do this; if she wants that, he will do that. He is truly obedient and follows her every command. In short, at this time, he regards his beloved as a goddess, and her words as a sacred decree. He would not hesitate to go through fire and water or be crushed to pieces for her. Now he is married to her. At first, he naturally continues to show her attentiveness and win her favor, but as time goes on, things slowly start to change. He is no longer as flattering, complimentary, respectful, or loving as he used to be. He is no longer as careful and obedient as he used to be. He now gradually wants to control everything and dominate everything, putting on the air of a husband as if he were invincible! Sometimes, when he is unhappy, he will glare at his wife, roar, and scold her, always using his wife as a punching bag. If his wife tries to advise him on something, he will say: "What do you know? Don't interfere in my affairs!"</p>
<p>As things progress, it gets even worse. He gradually becomes tired of his beloved, and he has other pursuits. He simply can't stay at home. He is out all day long, and when he occasionally comes back, he doesn't have a good face for his wife. If his wife asks him a few more questions, he will shout at her, saying that she is infringing on his freedom and not allowing her to nag.</p>
<p>In short, at this time, he has completely revealed his true colors, no, he has completely revealed the true face of a man!</p>
<h3 id="e163">Who Says Chinese Education Isn't Widespread? <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Whoever says Chinese education isn't widespread is blind. Look, there are no fewer than forty or fifty universities and specialized schools across the country. Agriculture, engineering, commerce, mathematics, physics, chemistry, literature, law, medicine, education, art, physical education... whatever subjects are available in the East, the West, various countries, we don't lack a single one. As for middle schools, provincial, county, public, private, they are everywhere in the country. And they also have specialized departments such as agriculture, engineering, commerce, literature, and education, not lacking a single one. Furthermore, there are even more primary schools that are too numerous to count. There are affiliated ones, county-run ones, city-run ones, township-run ones... In short, everything is available.</p>
<p>As for the lower classes and the remote villages, it's not desolate either. There are plenty of old-fashioned Confucian scholars who failed to pass the imperial examinations in the previous dynasty, wearing old-fashioned glasses, holding stiff rulers, chasing after a group of naughty children with runny noses, implementing the authentic national essence education of "Confucius said" and "The Book of Odes."</p>
<p>Moreover, there's no need to even mention popular education. And we have immediate examples. For instance, on the walls of small alleys, you can always see slogans such as "No Urinating," "Damn You for Urinating," etc., for those lower-class people who urinate at will to see. Some even draw a large turtle. This method of propaganda using picture literacy not only shows that the person writing it has received an education, but also contains profound educational significance. Furthermore, beggars in Shanghai often display a large passage in English, the writing is neat, the prose is fluent, and a translation is attached. Think about it, scholars who are knowledgeable in both Chinese and Western learning are only beggars. Isn't our country's education too widespread?</p>
<p>Therefore, I say, whoever says Chinese education isn't widespread is blind.</p>
<h3 id="e164">The Lolo People of Yunnan (Part 1) <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yu</p>
<p>Here, I plan to introduce to you the aborigines living in Yunnan.</p>
<p>These aborigines are commonly called "Lolo" by the Han people.</p>
<p>Speaking of Lolo, there seems to be more than one kind. There are so-called Flowery Lolo, Han Lolo, and Water Lolo.</p>
<p>Han Lolo are probably named because they are mostly close to the Han people. I will introduce this type here. As for the other two types, because I have never been in contact with them, I know as little about their lives as you do. I can't even explain the meanings of the words "Flowery" in Flowery Lolo and "Water" in Water Lolo. Now, let me report what I know to you.</p>
<p>(1) Language and Writing</p>
<p>These people have their own language and writing, and this language can also be used in the border areas of Myanmar. I heard that it is not difficult to learn. I have seen many people who are often in contact with them speak fluent Lolo. Even I myself have learned the pronunciation of the ten numbers one to ten.</p>
<p>Their writing is horizontal like Western writing. I heard that they also have an alphabet; however, what they use for writing is not a writing brush or a fountain pen, but the petiole of a fern (pteridophyte) after the veins have been removed. Writing with it is like writing with a steel pen, but it is not as smooth and durable as a steel pen.</p>
<p>As for books, apart from many religious scriptures, there seem to be no other works. And these scriptures are all handwritten. (2) Religious Beliefs</p>
<p>In every temple, we can find a huge idol of Sakyamuni, so we can assume that they believe in Buddhism. Their temples are called "Burmese Temples." The architecture of these Burmese Temples is very grand. Living in the Burmese Temples are a "Grand Buddha and several or even dozens of young monks." The Grand Buddha is sometimes also called "Elder." After he dies, his position is inherited by the oldest of the young monks. This oldest of the young monks is also called the "Second Buddha" when the elder is not yet dead. The young monks are all Lolo children. Some are volunteers who want to be monks, some are sent to the Burmese Temple by their parents, and some are designated to be monks.</p>
<p>The Grand Buddha cannot marry. However, the young monks can "return to secular life" when they want to marry, which means leaving the Burmese Temple and regaining their status as ordinary people.</p>
<p>Usually, there is one Burmese Temple in one or several villages. The Grand Buddha and the young monks in the Burmese Temple do nothing but chant scriptures. What they wear and eat is provided by the people of this one or several villages.</p>
<p>The Grand Buddha in this Lolo group is like the pastor in Christianity in medieval Rome. He will use Buddhist spells to cure people's illnesses. Every newborn child must ask the Grand Buddha to bless him with longevity and give him a rope with many knots tied around his neck. This probably means that his soul is not allowed to leave his body. When a person passes away from this world, the Grand Buddha must also pray for his peace and happiness after death and surround his grave with a straw rope tied with many mysterious knots, which probably means to protect him and not allow anything else to invade him. The Lolo treat the Grand Buddha like a god. Even the Buddha's father and mother must kowtow to the Buddha. Regarding this matter, the general explanation is that his parents do not respect him, but respect his "yellow robe." The so-called yellow robe is the clothing of the Grand Buddha and the young monks. This is completely different from ordinary clothes. They wrap a piece of yellow cloth around their lower body as trousers, and wrap a larger piece of yellow cloth around their upper body like women in the city use scarves as clothes. However, these two pieces of yellow cloth are by no means whole pieces, but are made of several square pieces of cloth arranged in a certain way.</p>
<p>Just as Christians go to church every Sunday to "attend mass," the Lolo people also go to the Burmese Temple on certain days to "drip water."</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Haiquan was already somewhat tired of student life, especially science studies. Moreover, his age had exceeded twenty, so he couldn't avoid suffering from a kind of youth disease prevalent among young people: boredom. Originally, this kind of adolescent boredom was very easy to cure, as long as the right medicine was prescribed. What medicine? That is, to liberate their sexual and economic oppression. But before Chinese society is transformed, it is not easy for young people to be liberated from this boredom. Young people who are oppressed naturally have many complaints. From complaints to lamentations, it eventually manifests as a distorted form of literature, dominating the entire literary scene in China. Although Haiquan aspired to study science, he sometimes felt that there was no hope for the future, so he couldn't help but feel pessimistic. At the same time, like ordinary young people, he was subjected to the aforementioned oppression, and lived in boredom all the time. Therefore, he would sometimes voice a few complaints, lament his own life, and express it in the form of poetry or prose. Tang Yaoxing knew that he also liked to doodle and write, so he came to persuade him to join the literary society they had organized.</p>
<p>"Are you willing to be our member?"</p>
<p>Tang Yaoxing's attitude was very sincere. This could be seen intuitively. Haiquan suddenly felt that his attitude was admirable, but he was still hesitant.</p>
<p>"Me?..."</p>
<p>He tilted his head as if he was thinking deeply, as if it was very difficult to make a decision.</p>
<p>"Do you have any doubts?"</p>
<p>"I don't have any doubts. But I want to meet Mr. Chen Huamin first and ask him about his literary views. He can't take Art for Art's sake as his position like we do, right?"</p>
<p>"Of course not. He is someone with literary views. What you said is right. I'll make an appointment with him first and have you meet. But you must be absolutely secret! Don't tell any classmates, because there are too many literary groups in the school now, mutually slandering and undermining each other..."</p>
<p>"Then I understand..."</p>
<p>As Haiquan said this, he suddenly went from literary arts to thinking about the students in the literature department, and from the students in the literature department to thinking about Miss Zhuo he saw this morning.</p>
<p>"...Are you recruiting female members?"</p>
<p>"Not for the time being. Chinese women don't have much power yet."</p>
<p>"What do you think of Zhuo Shuhua in the literature department?"</p>
<p>After Haiquan said this, he felt a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>"You think she's pretty, don't you? Ha, ha!"</p>
<p>"Nonsense!"</p>
<p>"She's a useless person!"</p>
<p>Tang Yaoxing used these five words in a stern tone to completely dismiss Miss Zhuo.</p>
<p>"Why? As long as she can write articles, that's enough. I heard that her poetry is quite good."</p>
<p>"The literary arts that are needed today are not just literary arts of blood and tears. The most important condition is the condition of strength..."</p>

<h3 id="e166">Commodity Production Reduction and Global Economic Trends <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yu-huan</p>
<p>Since the Wall Street Stock Exchange in the United States staged a chaotic drama in 1929, the economic situation in the United States has plummeted, becoming unmanageable, and the phenomenon of recession has spread throughout the world. To this day, it has gone through a long period of more than two and a half years of decline, and the depth of the scene is unprecedented. According to the economic situation index listed in The Analist magazine, the extent of the economic panic in the United States reached a peak of 110.1% in May 1929, but suddenly dropped to 92.1% in December. Since then, it has gradually declined to 74.0% in August 1931, which has gradually revealed the acute form of panic. Moreover, with the general decline in prices, such as cotton, in August 1931, it had fallen from 12 cents per pound the year before to 6 cents, and wheat had fallen from 85 cents to 50 cents. The number of bank failures in the United States has reached as many as 1,210 by September of this year.</p>
<p>Overproduction and increased unemployment are the most important reasons for the current economic downturn in the world. In order to protect their own industries and increase national financial income, countries are competing to engage in tariff wars, building high tariff barriers in an attempt to drive out foreign economic forces and indirectly enrich national financial income. Although this kind of non-violent war behavior is enough to alleviate the economic recession temporarily, it is ultimately not a correct plan to abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial.</p>
<p>The reason why the original economic panic occurred is that the world economy has suddenly lost its balance today, which has led to it. Therefore, in addition to the protective tariff policy, the so-called controlled economy has emerged at the same time, and countries have adopted it as an important economic policy. The implementation methods of controlled economy do not go beyond two paths: one is to manage exchange rates, and the other is to manage trade. The former lies in adjusting the currency of the country to prevent the outflow of cash abroad, and the latter lies in restricting unnecessary foreign imports in order to improve international lending. These two are implemented simultaneously in some countries, and only one is limited in others. In short, their goal is to try to alleviate economic panic and return to the road of prosperity.</p>
<p>Recently, countries have also taken measures to reduce production in order to save the economic downturn. The most notable example is Cuban sugar, whose production volume in the 1929-30 year was 4,671,000 tons. It is said that from the coming year, it will be reduced to 2 million tons. Also, Java sugar was 2,903,000 tons in 1929-30, and it will also be reduced to 1,350,000 tons in the coming year.</p>
<p>Wheat is also one of the world's important commodities. In recent years, the market price has been greatly affected due to the good harvest and excessive supply. Recently, various places have risen up to find ways to implement production reduction. In the United States, the production volume this year and the remaining amount of 320 million bushels from last year are combined, which is 990 million bushels. In the future, the domestic consumption volume will need 750 million bushels, and the export volume will be 80 million bushels. As a result, the remaining amount for the next year will be 160 million bushels, which is half the state of last year. In Canada, according to the latest forecast, the harvest will be reduced by 27 million bushels this year. According to the telegraph on November 15 this year, Australian wheat will be reduced by about 27 million bushels. Romania's net export volume this year is expected to decrease by 10 million bushels. Also, Soviet Russia is expected to reduce production by 740 million bushels this year.</p>
<p>Also, according to the recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Commerce, this year's cotton production will be the lowest in the past nine years. The number of acres planted with cotton in the United States has been sharply reduced, and there are even more cotton fields suspended in Egypt. It was predetermined to reduce cotton harvest by 33%. Although the cotton harvest in Brazil, Mexico, and Lower India is estimated to reach 4.2 million bales, an increase of 800,000 bales compared with the previous year, and the cotton production in China and Persia has also increased, it is estimated that the world's production volume is only 23.4 million bales. Among them, the harvest in the United States will be between 11 million and 12 million bales. It is found that in 1923, the world's cotton harvest was 19.125 million bales, and it suddenly increased to 23.825 million bales the following year. Since then, the surplus has accumulated day by day, and cotton prices have fallen sharply. Now it is the first sharp reduction in the past nine years.</p>
<p>Sugar, wheat, and cotton are in the most important position in the world's commodities. The quantity of their annual production and consumption is enough to greatly affect the future of the world economy. According to the above-mentioned circumstances, the major sugar-producing countries such as Cuba and Java, and the wheat and cotton-producing countries such as the United States and Australia, can implement production reduction plans, which is helpful to the future of the world economy and is not shallow. If we can continue to advance in this direction in the future, we can believe that the future of the world's production undertakings will gradually be able to get rid of the state of oversupply and sluggish demand, and return to the path of balance. The results obtained are certainly better than the protective tariff policy that seeks the welfare of one's own country. From this, we can know that in today's economic world that is trapped in the abyss of recession and cannot be revitalized, if we want to seek true relief, we must rely on mutual cooperation and the spirit of sincerity to work hard. Otherwise, if we allow this to continue, the economic policies of using neighboring countries as a dumping ground will see countries competing to follow suit, and the total collapse of the world economy will inevitably be imminent.</p>
<h3 id="e167">World Cotton Production and Sales <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this century, the past cotton season (up to the end of July this year) has been the worst, and cotton producers will never forget it. The average price of American cotton (American Upland) from 1931 to 1932 was US$0.0589 per pound, compared with US$0.174 per pound from 1929 to 1930, and US$0.076 per pound from 1899 to 1900, which was known as a low price. The combination of these two reasons caused this tragic situation to occur. The world panic is indeed a powerful reduction in the needs of textile manufacturers. Except for 1925-26 and 1926-27, the production volume from 1931 to 1932 was more than any year. In the United States, Egypt, and other places, even after government intervention to prevent the downward trend of market prices, it was of no use. On the contrary, the demand showed very little for cheap raw materials. The following table is a statistic of the world's cotton supply, mill consumption, and market prices in recent years.</p>

<p>A 500 pounds per bale, B Actual number of bales, C Liverpool</p>
<p>Various supplies reported by the Cotton Industry Federation and the International Spinning Workers' Association of Textile Industry Owners, plus cotton stored in mills.</p>
<p>The above table is not exactly comparable, because of the different weights of each bale, and the mill consumption does not include the domestic consumption in India, China, Egypt, and countries with less production. Therefore, since there is no accurate quantity of domestic consumption, the usual estimate is about 1.25 million bales per year. However, even without considering the difficulties in statistics, the price situation in recent years is very easy to express, because the production exceeds the consumption and fails.</p>
<p>Cotton production is certainly not uniform, so each place has its own special market. The world's major cotton is produced in the United States, Egypt, and India. Egyptian cotton is better than American cotton, and the quality of most Indian cotton is inferior to that of American cotton yarn. The separate tables of cotton production and mill consumption in various places are as follows:　　World Cotton Production Statistics Table (Unit: Million bales, 500 pounds per bale)</p>

<p>It is found that the United States holds the leading position in the world's cotton production. However, since 1927 to 1931, American cotton has gradually decreased in the world's total consumption. The main reason is that the price comparison is slightly higher. Last year, when American cotton was cheaper, this trend was actually the opposite. At that time, the production and import volume of the United States was superior to the production of foreign countries. However, in recent years, the demand for Egyptian cotton has not changed much.</p>
<p>In addition, the governments of the United States and Egypt, in order to oppose the policy of cotton storage exceeding the market, have reduced the planted acreage to remedy it. In addition to increasing demand or poor harvest, this is to solve the excess supply and the unprofitable reduction of one-tenth. Egypt will reduce it by about 20%. The cotton stored in the United States is still higher than before until the end of this season. Therefore, the first public estimate of cotton production was published, which caused the cotton price, which had not yet fallen completely, to rise suddenly. Until October, the public estimate of cotton production was about 11.425 million bales, while in 1932-1933, the actual production was 17.096 million bales. As for the Egyptian cotton production volume, it is estimated to decrease from 1.288 million bales to 869,000 bales compared to last year's harvest. If the cotton consumption rate of last year can still be maintained as before in this year, until the current season, the cotton stored in the United States and Egypt can still be reduced in quantity. Although the world's supply and possible consumption cannot be estimated, it seems impossible for the cotton price to fall to the low price found at the beginning of the year. However, in the near future, unless the planted acreage in the United States and other places is reduced again, and then other goods cause the price of a large amount of stored cotton to be firmly fixed and increase, the cotton market situation is fundamentally different from wool. The amount of wool collected has already met the needs of the market, and there is no excessive accumulation of cotton yarn in the hands of producers. Before cotton production is more favorable to cotton producers, cotton producers will have a major burden due to the supply restricted by human power.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Soviet Russia's Foreign Trade in the Decline of World Commerce <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Jianchu</p>
<p>The Soviet Russia's foreign trade is exclusively operated by the government. The export of goods is continuous. However, its purpose is not commercial competition, but to absorb foreign currency to pay for the value of planned imports. The domestic market often feels insufficient, but the export volume has never declined, which is actually because the power of foreign trade is in the hands of the government. The goods imported each year are based on the Five-Year Plan, rather than good and urgently needed goods, and are mainly used to assist production, especially industry and construction. Daily necessities are the most lacking, and imports are almost extinct. The point of view of a country with state-run trade is very different from that of other countries. The prices in Soviet Russia are all determined by the government, standing tall and independent, and not affected by the world market. Price fluctuations are purely determined by domestic reasons, and have little to do with the trend of world prices. The currency value of Soviet Russia is also designated by the government, and there is no fear of momentary changes. At this time of panic and anger, when the world is agitated, if we want to understand the foreign trade of Soviet Russia, we must first know the above-mentioned characteristics.</p>
<p>The world economic panic is in full swing, and prices have fallen miserably, falling thousands of miles, and the impact on Soviet Russia seems to be very subtle. Because in recent years, prices in Soviet Russia have risen, and the trend of agricultural products has been particularly sharp. The prices in Soviet Russia are so-called cooperative prices, which are stipulated by the authorities, and the number of sales is also limited, and they are only sold to people who enjoy the right to purchase the item. This kind of price has changed little in 1931, while the price in the free market has soared and soared. The difference between the cooperative price and the self-price is huge, which is enough to see the urgency and urgency of the Soviet Russian people. The government's supply of daily necessities is insufficient, so they turn to merchants to buy them. The prices are slightly higher, but they are not counted. Therefore, in 1931, due to the lack of necessities, the increase in retail prices was particularly rapid, and the world prices were trying to pour out, so it seemed impossible to export necessities. However, judging from the actual situation, it is very different. Key products that are urgently needed in the domestic market are continuously exported, and the prices are extremely low and the losses are huge, because the government of Soviet Russia pays for the value of imports. Kaganovch, the spokesman of the Soviet Russian government, also said because he could not overcome the supply of consumers, "We have built major factories and must continue. Therefore, our export trade will never let go." This is enough to explain the attitude of Soviet Russia. At this time of world unease, trade in various countries is sluggish, but in 1931, Soviet Russia's export trade has greatly increased. This is also because the government is working hard to promote it, and both cost and people's livelihood are not counted, so there is this畸 形development.</p>
<p>The situation of Soviet Russia's foreign trade in 1931 and the first half of 1932 is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Export　　　　　　　　　　Import　　　　　　　　　　Total Import and Export</p>
<p>Thousand tons　　　　Thousand rubles　　　　　Tons　　　　　　　　Rubles　　　　　Tons　　　　　　　　Rubles</p>
<p>1931　21,779　811,210　3,564　1,105,034　25,342　1,916,334</p>
<p>1932 (First Half)　7,309　275,160　1,043　405,273　8,252　680,433</p>
<p>Therefore, the impact of the world panic in 1931 on Soviet Russia's foreign trade was the miserable fall in the value of export goods, while the export volume increased slightly. As for its preferential treatment of import trade and cheap prices, although many years of old debts have not been paid off, it can still obtain new loans to support it, which is deeply benefited.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1932, the value of export goods decreased sharply, and the import business also suffered setbacks. Although the process of domestic industrialization cannot be delayed, due to the impact of the world recession, it has to slow down its pace slightly. Therefore, in 1932, the pressure of the world panic was far greater than in 1931, and Soviet Russia could not stand aloof from the world, but had to share its fate with various countries and tighten its foreign trade. The difficulties in the domestic economy are becoming more and more serious, the lack of agricultural products, and the failure to implement industrial plans have made the Soviet Russian authorities exhausted. Therefore, this year's foreign trade in Soviet Russia will inevitably have a large decrease.</p>
<h3 id="e169">A Brief Discussion on Modern Currency (1) <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Ke</p>
<p>The issue of currency has been extremely complex since ancient times, and its impact is greatly related to people's livelihoods and national economy. Therefore, many intelligent people have paid close attention to it, and there are also many related works. The economies of various countries are showing signs of decline, and the international financial hub has also lost its function. Various currency problems have emerged like bamboo shoots after rain, all at once. The complexity of their roots and the breadth of their involvement are truly enough to make wise people stammer and capable people withdraw their hands. However, the world's currency problems cannot remain unresolved for long, or it will leave endless troubles. Therefore, researchers have emerged one after another, producing great works and short chapters, offering various opinions. Some present profound principles, while others discuss partial problems. The lower ones even engage in useless propaganda for their own interests. It is rare to find someone who can point out the essence of the principles and problems with a fair attitude and simple language so that everyone can understand. This spring, Mr. D.B. Woodward and Mr. Marc A. Rose published the book "A Brief Discussion on Modern Currency." Although its content has no unique insights, it discusses matters based on facts, without preconceived notions, and is comprehensive and detailed. Reading it does not cause any obstacles. Therefore, we specially asked Mr. Ke to translate and publish it in installments in this publication for the study of our countrymen. - Editor's note</p>
<p>Chapter 1: The Origin of Currency</p>
<p>To understand the origin of currency, we must first clarify its definition. Now, let us examine Webster's Dictionary, which defines the word "currency" as any object that is used as a medium of exchange and also serves as a standard of value is currency. Therefore, gold, silver, and round coins are currency. Even fur, silk, shells, and salt, if used as a medium of exchange and a standard of value, are also currency. Moreover, in fact, these things have all been used as currency by various primitive peoples. For example, otter skins were still used as currency and circulated in the Americas in the 18th century.</p>
<p>It is impossible to determine when and where the use of currency first began. It is said that coins first circulated in Egypt and Lydia. According to recent research, Lydia may have come first. However, the use of currency far predates the invention of coins, so the true picture of its initial circulation cannot be known.</p>
<p>However, one thing is certain: the invention of currency was not the sole act of any one nation. All nations in the world gradually evolved from barbaric life to a period of intellectual development. Human affairs became more complex, desires increased, the use of goods became more widespread, and transactions became laborious. Therefore, they felt the importance of a medium of exchange and a standard of prices, and thus invented and used currency. Therefore, the use of currency became a universal trend. No one nation can claim the sole credit for its invention, just as the invention and development of writing were achieved separately by various nations.</p>
<p>Although we cannot know the exact place and time of the origin of currency, we can generally understand its trend of evolution. Now, let us first look at the main facts of the matter, so that we can learn from the past and avoid being clueless when discussing current currency problems.</p>
<p>Humanity's basic needs are clothing, food, and shelter. People can compete with nature using their own intelligence and physical strength, and obtain what they need from nature's embrace to satisfy their desires. However, under this mode of production, the results are often meager and insufficient for use. If they can focus their energy on one thing, the results will be far better than when dividing their attention among various things. However, the establishment of this specialization must first require trade. In an economic life where division of labor and trade coexist, a person can exchange their specialized products with others to obtain other necessities to meet their living needs. The simplest form of this kind of transaction is the direct form of bartering, which is called direct exchange. However, direct exchange can only be carried out in the simplest societies. In complex societies, the number of traders is large, and the goods traded are also numerous. At this point, direct exchange reaches its limit. If we want to promote this matter to benefit people's lives, we must invent a medium that can exchange any goods and is desired by everyone. With this thing, everyone can specialize in one industry, exchange the results of their work for this thing that the public desires, and then use this thing to exchange for all the necessities of life they need. In this situation, the transaction changes from direct to indirect.</p>
<p>This universal commodity used as a medium of exchange is currency. Any commodity can be used as currency. In fact, this is exactly the case. In ancient China, shells, silk, and deer skins were used. The people of Aztec used coconuts. The early colonists of America used tobacco. Some Indian tribes used coal, and added carvings to enhance its beauty.</p>
<p>Several kinds of goods are particularly desired because of their quality, such as bread and salt. A person owns an axe and exchanges it for salt and stores it. At the beginning of the transaction, he may not need salt, but he sees that this salt can be exchanged for any other thing he needs in the future, so he develops a need for it and wants to exchange for it and treasure it. Therefore, the reason why salt is desired is not only because it can be used for food, but also because it can be exchanged for any other kind of goods at any time. In this case, salt is currency. This is also true for other things. These goods that become currency all have considerable characteristics: (1) Their quantity must be relatively small, but not too scarce. (2) Their body must be divisible for transactions of various amounts. (3) Their body must be light and easy to carry, so that they can be transported without loss. (4) Their quality must be solid, durable, and not easily damaged. Salt, rice, shells, and silk all have these qualities. This standard is perfectly in line with the conditions for modern ideal currency, which shows the meticulousness of the ancients' thinking.</p>
<p>Later, the types of currency used in trade gradually decreased, and the selection of currency was no longer a matter of thought and consciousness. The selection came from a gradual process of trial and error, using the most popular things as currency. During this period, a new important quality of currency appeared, that is, it must be able to satisfy people's desire for decoration. Anything that can be used for decoration is the best medium of exchange. Treasures are like currency, durable, rare, and of high value, but not too heavy, so they are often used as currency. Piles of ornaments, bracelets, and other objects are also like this, because they have all been widely used as currency.</p>
<p>After currency came into circulation, prices followed. When there was no currency, the so-called price was only the quantity of one thing used to exchange for another. After the use of currency replaced the fact of direct exchange, the price of goods began to be measured in currency. Therefore, economists often say that currency is a medium of exchange and a standard of prices. In addition to this, currency has another function, which is that it can be used as a store of value. After having currency, we no longer need to accumulate and store all our things, and then sell them to exchange for what we need. We can first sell all our things, exchange them for money to store, and then use this money to buy anything we need.</p>
<p>As transactions become more frequent, trade develops. However, the handling of trade is not necessarily completed at one time. Sometimes, due to various reasons, the payment of prices is always done later. Therefore, it is necessary to first stipulate what will be used to pay this price at that time, and what the quantity and quality will be. All these points can be well hidden by currency. Therefore, currency has a fourth use, that is, it can be used as a standard for deferred payments.</p>
<p>In short, since the invention of currency, the division of labor has become possible. People can specialize in one industry to develop specialized and advanced skills, which is the forerunner of higher industry in the future. People can also measure the price of their own products in currency to compare them with other things and determine the standard of exchange. They can also accumulate currency and exchange it for anything they need anytime and anywhere. In addition, they can use it for deferred payments and income to facilitate the conduct of business. In short, after having currency, people can create today's great business activities and economic civilization. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e170">Talking About Time <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>With nothing to talk about, let's talk about time.</p>
<p>Many people say that Chinese people are not punctual. This is a big mistake. Chinese people value time. There are famous sayings throughout the ages to prove it. Dayu cherished every inch of time, and Tao Kan cherished every minute.</p>
<p>For example, if a certain group or expert meeting invites you to participate, and the time is set for 1:00 PM, then you should at least wait at home until 1:30 PM before putting on your Zhongshan suit and setting off. Upon entering the meeting place, you take off your hat, hand it to the attendant, and then shake hands with everyone and say hello. Finally, you slowly say, "I just went to visit a certain important party and state figure and talked about many major plans to save the country. I'm really too busy..." Thus, many comrades present will secretly marvel and respect you. This happens once or twice, and then your value will increase a hundredfold in an invisible way, because only important people are too busy with their time.</p>
<p>As for who invites you to drink, you can be at least two hours late, because if you go on time, the host's attendant will suspect that you haven't eaten for three days. Therefore, those who are well-versed in the ways of the world often deliberately arrive late, and it is best to leave after eating one or two dishes, preferring to go back and eat rice with boiled water, so as not to offend good manners.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, there is a reason why Chinese people are not punctual. Can we still insult them arbitrarily like foreigners?</p>
<p>Time is something that circulates endlessly. If today is over, there is still tomorrow. Therefore, things that cannot be done today can be left for tomorrow. Things that you don't want to do today can be thought of later. Human energy is limited, so why should people be so diligent? Therefore, foreigners take time too seriously and exhaust their energy, which is inevitably foolish.</p>
<p>As for playing with time, it is the special skill of our compatriots, which cannot be denied. For example, when the Japanese army occupied the Northeast, we did not have to immediately send troops to save the country. We could take our time to appeal to the League of Nations, and we could take a hundred steps back and resist for a long time. The so-called "long time" of course means to continue indefinitely. If the Japanese army occupies Shanghai again today, we can wait until tomorrow to retreat to Tongguan along with the official seals. If they occupy Luoyang tomorrow, then we can retreat to the vast Gobi Desert of Outer Mongolia the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese disputes can certainly wait for the League of Nations to resolve. As for the League of Nations wanting to divide China, then we can set up a water and land Taoist temple and piously pray to Heaven, waiting for the Jade Emperor to uphold justice.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, how much more of tomorrow is there? Life is not full of a hundred years, why not delay a little longer? This is my conclusion.</p>

<p>The Hu Jia flute plays a mournful tune, the fate of the country hangs by a thread. Sighing that the chase for power continues in Sichuan and Guizhou, I feel alienated from the fields of the divine land.</p>
<p>It is difficult to support a tall building with a single pillar. What are the generals of the Central Plains doing? The isolated army is cut off and suffers destruction. Who else can save the country from disaster?</p>
<p>With the ambition to swallow rivers and mountains and save the world from difficulties, he endured the pain of retreating and secretly shed tears. If not for the general's courage to frighten the enemy, the Hu cavalry would have already crossed the Yuguan Pass.</p>
<p>Do not judge heroes by success or failure. How can loyal blood and a loyal heart be obscured? Yue Fei was loyal, and Qin Hui was a traitor. Praise and blame are the same in ancient and modern times.</p>

<p>— Erming</p>
<p>Ordinary crude sugar obtained from sugarcane or beets often contains ash and invert sugar. Therefore, it is often refined with bone char to obtain refined sugar. Refined sugar is white in color, and its quality is better than that of sugar made from sugarcane or beets. Therefore, I will briefly describe its manufacturing method.</p>
<p>Grade of Raw Sugar The grade of raw sugar, that is, crude sugar, depends on its color and the content of water, sucrose, glucose, and inorganic matter. The lighter the color, the more bone char can be saved during refining. The more glucose and inorganic matter it contains, the lower the yield of refined sugar. The yield of refined sugar is the percentage of sucrose calculated from the rotation, minus five times the percentage of inorganic matter (ash) and one times the percentage of glucose (the yield can be arbitrarily specified, for example, in Germany, the yield of beet sugar is defined as the percentage of sucrose minus five times the percentage of invert sugar). Ordinary crude sugar with a yield of 95% or more is excellent raw material. Recently, the use of preparatory treatment methods has been able to increase the grade of inferior sugar and make it suitable for the manufacture of refined sugar. The crystallization of raw sugar should be uniform, and it is best not to contain fine particles. Also, the amount of molasses attached should be as little as possible.</p>
<p>Sugar with wet properties often contains some invert sugar. Therefore, if beet sugar that does not contain any invert sugar is used as raw material to manufacture this kind of granulated sugar, it is usually mixed with an appropriate amount of cane sugar. Also, beet sugar is mostly alkaline, while cane sugar is mostly acidic. Therefore, when manufacturing refined sugar, they are also mixed in appropriate amounts to neutralize each other. In short, the blending of raw sugar is one of the most important projects in sugar manufacturing.</p>
<p>Preparatory Treatment Method of Raw Sugar Raw sugar is often subjected to preparatory treatment by mechanical methods to remove most of the impurities. In this method, thick sugar water is mixed into the raw sugar, and then a centrifugal machine is used to separate the molasses. At this time, auxiliary work such as spraying cold water or thick sugar water is often applied. However, there are also those who blow steam into the center of the centrifugal machine. In this way, the separation is more complete.</p>

<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Dissolution and Cleaning After the raw sugar has been treated with the preparatory method, it is placed in a dissolving pot to dissolve it. The pot is a square, open-ended iron cylinder with various diameters and a depth of about four to five feet, which can hold a solution containing three to ten tons of sugar. There is a false bottom in the center, and four steam spiral tubes are installed under the false bottom. Water is injected into the pot so that it submerges the steam tubes, and then steam is passed through it, adding an appropriate amount of heat. Next, water and sugar are added above the false bottom, and a rotating stirrer is installed under the false bottom to promote the dissolution of the sugar. Also, at the intersection of its right side and another room, there is a wire mesh made of brass. The dissolved sugar liquid flows out through this to remove large impurities and prevent them from going to the filter. The obtained sugar liquid is then filtered, or slightly cleaned in the dissolving pot or other cleaning device, and then filtered through a metal wire mesh to remove some of the impurities. Then it is filtered with a filter. Lime is mostly used as a cleaning agent, or a certain amount of phosphoric acid is added at the same time. In addition, there are also those who use aluminum sulfate and lime.</p>
<p>Decolorization The sugar liquid that has been filtered still has some color, so it must be passed through a bone char filter to decolorize it. The bone char filter is a large cylinder filled with bone char. Because bone char has a special absorption effect, it can remove the color quality. The device is made of cast iron or wrought iron and varies in size, such as 10 feet in diameter and 20 feet in height as an example. Bone char is loaded into the bone char filter from the upper opening and stacked on the cloth laid on the false bottom. Warm sugar liquid is pressed in through the pipe, passes through the bone char layer, and overflows into a receiver. After being tightly closed and placed for thirty or twenty hours, it is then allowed to flow out. When the decolorization power of the bone char decreases, warm water is sent in to fully wash it. The obtained dilute washing liquid can be used to dissolve raw sugar, or evaporated to make inferior sugar. The damp bone char is taken out from the opening on the lower side and appropriately heated. It can still be used repeatedly. This operation is called the regeneration of bone char.</p>
<p>Evaporation The sugar liquid that has been decolorized is then evaporated and concentrated. The commonly used method is vacuum evaporation, that is, evaporating the sugar liquid under low pressure. Using this method can make the sugar liquid boil and evaporate at around 50 degrees Celsius, so there is no danger of overheating, and it will not cause the conversion of sucrose. In addition, evaporation is rapid and steam consumption is minimal, which is very beneficial. Especially if several vacuum evaporators are connected, the steam generated by the first evaporator is used to heat the sugar liquid in the second evaporator, and the steam it generates is used to evaporate the sugar liquid in the third evaporator. This device is more economical. This type of device is called a multi-effect evaporation device, so it is the most widely used today.</p>
<p>Sugar Boiling and Crystallization The sugar liquid after evaporation still contains a large amount of water, so it must be evaporated and concentrated to make its water content only about 10%. This is called the sugar boiling method. After the sugar boiling method is performed, the crystallization method is performed. In modern large factories, these two operations are performed in a vacuum crystallizer. The vacuum crystallizer is a low cylinder made of cast iron, with several sections of steam spiral tubes inside to heat the sugar liquid. First, the pump is operated to reduce the pressure in the device, and then thick sugar liquid is injected until it completely covers the lowest section of the spiral tube. Then, steam is passed into the spiral tube, and the sugar liquid is gradually added. As it increases, steam is also passed through the serpentine tube at the top. When the sugar liquid reaches an appropriate concentration, new sugar liquid is quickly added, or the vacuum degree is increased, and the supply of steam is limited to slightly lower the temperature of the sugar liquid inside. As a result, fine crystal nuclei are generated in the sugar liquid. These are the seeds of crystalline sugar. More thick sugar liquid is added, and steam is passed through to continue boiling the sugar so that the crystals grow. When the crystals are full, the injection of sugar liquid and the passage of steam are stopped, and the bottom of the device is opened to take out the crystalline sugar paste.</p>
<p>Centrifugation The cooled crystalline sugar paste is crystalline granulated sugar attached with mother liquor (ie, molasses), so it must be separated. This is called the centrifugation method. Centrifugal machines are often used for centrifugation. First, the centrifugal machine is slowly rotated, and the crystalline sugar paste is added behind the screen. Then, it is rotated at a speed of about one thousand to one thousand five hundred times per minute, and the molasses passes through the screen holes to the outer cylinder. The refined sugar remains on the inner surface of the screen. If you want to make it more pure white, you can wash it with water containing a small amount of ultramarine during centrifugation.</p>
<p>Drying The refined sugar after centrifugation can be spread on the floor to cool and dry. If you want to get a sufficiently dry product, you can dry it in the sun or use a dryer.</p>

<p>— Return I</p>
<p>At this time, it was after dusk, on this road known for its remoteness, the pale green streetlights were shining. Only the fallen leaves from the trees on both sides of the road, blown down by the west wind, occasionally rustled on the ground due to the breeze, breaking the deathly silence.</p>
<p>A thief who had just been released from prison today seemed to feel that he had no face to show to people of his kind, because he himself had lost his morality, and he knew that he had lost this morality. Also, he had no home to return to, and wanted to leave the crowd, but in the end he could not escape this world, so he came to this remote road to breathe a few breaths of air comfortably.</p>
<p>Three months ago, when his old mother was dangerously ill, he committed theft and was arrested by the patrol officers of the public security office and detained in prison. Although he has now served his sentence and been released from prison, he is still an unemployed person with no work to do and no place to eat. However, he now has no place to live. The tall houses, built on this land owned by mankind, although there are many, have never taken in people without money to live in.</p>
<p>He is still young, but his bleak complexion seems to indicate that he has deteriorated to the extreme. Outside his tattered cloth robe, he wore a straw rope, shrugged his shoulders, held a crude wooden stick that he had picked up from somewhere, and walked listlessly on this remote road.</p>
<p>A child walked towards him, singing a tuneless song and skipping, looking as if he was very happy. At a time when his mood was particularly bad, he was even a little jealous of other people's happiness, glared at the child, and caught sight of the streetlight shining on the child's slightly waving hand, on which a gold ring as thin as a thread was worn on the middle finger. He immediately began to calculate his life for tomorrow.</p>
<p>"Isn't this a great opportunity!" His heart was urging him.</p>
<p>"Although this thing is small, it is still worth a few dollars!" After thinking this, he calmly stopped the child's path.</p>
<p>"Why don't you let me go?"</p>
<p>"Take off this gold ring and give it to me!" He suddenly turned into a ferocious demon, and shouted at the child in a stern voice.</p>
<p>"This... this is my... thing!" The child was a little scared.</p>
<p>"You dare to be rude, you dare to disobey! You are just a weak child."</p>
<p>He grabbed the child and forcibly snatched the gold ring from the child's finger. As soon as he let go, the frightened child turned around and ran back crying.</p>
<p>He listened to the child's crying gradually fading away, and stood still next to the utility pole under the streetlight, staring at the gold ring in his palm in a daze, illuminated by the light. He was really a little proud to see this dazzling golden luster.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he shuddered and felt something, and chased after him, because his conscience suddenly developed and he regretted it.</p>
<p>He was very embarrassed; he ran a lot of roads forward, but besides himself, he didn't see a second person. Where could he find this child to return this gold ring? He had to shout loudly:</p>
<p>"Little boy! I'm playing with you, come here!"</p>
<p>He shouted like this several times, but there was no response, and he couldn't help but cover his face and cry bitterly. This was probably the first sad thing he had encountered in his life. But he continued to look for him, and saw a figure moving in front of him. He immediately ran up to see, but it was a little beggar of the same class as him.</p>
<p>"I have something to give you." He hurriedly said to the little beggar, and as he spoke, he stuffed the gold ring into the little beggar's hand. The little beggar, frightened as he had been when the child had been robbed of the gold ring, turned around and ran away.</p>

<p>— Duan Rui</p>
<p>Last Saturday afternoon, taking advantage of the fact that there were no classes at school, I went to the XX Temple with three colleagues, including Ms. S, for a stroll and recreation. As soon as we entered the temple, we saw a group of devout men and women burning incense and lighting candles, their sincerity and piety indescribable, especially our female compatriots. After turning to the back of the temple, we suddenly saw three Westerners, accompanied by a translator, visiting the incense table. A leader knelt in front of the table and bowed his head three times, and then took a bamboo container of fortune sticks from the temple keeper, muttering and shaking the container. Then, he took out a stick, number twenty-four, marked "Bad Luck." The translator, seeing this, immediately went to the temple keeper and asked him to exchange it for a more favorable "Moderate Luck" yellow slip. The translator then explained the slip in detail. Listening closely, I learned that what they were praying about was the political turmoil in their country. After hearing the translation, they showed a happy expression and wanted to leave. The translator told them that they had to pay for the incense. They gave three foreign banknotes, and the temple keeper thanked them repeatedly after receiving them. According to the temple keeper, he had been in the temple for decades and this was the first time he had done foreign business. According to the reporter, although this matter is small, it is enough to show the concern of people from that country about national affairs.</p>
<p>Correspondence from Store Employees</p>
<h3 id="e176">Proposed Answer to Mr. Zhou Liangji's Fifth Question <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>"Original Question" "Standing in the position of a shop employee, worker, or apprentice, how can one fulfill the obligations of a citizen of the Republic of China and engage in the work of resisting Japan and saving the nation?"</p>
<p>"Proposed Answer" Generally, shop employees, workers, or apprentices are all employed by others. Besides being loyal to their duties, any other actions are enough to incur the jealousy of managers and supervisors. Although they may not be able to do anything to you for engaging in the work of resisting Japan and saving the nation, they often easily use other issues as pretexts to subject you to very harsh punishments. The question raised by Mr. Zhou is indeed a critical issue that urgently needs to be resolved. I will now write down my humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Shop clerks of the intellectual class: Can use their spare time to create more anti-Japanese and national salvation propaganda materials and send them to relevant national salvation organizations to serve as propaganda materials.</p>
<p>2.  Shop clerks with relatively high incomes: Can save on all unnecessary expenses and donate to national salvation funds.</p>
<p>3.  Regardless of whether you are a shop clerk, worker, or apprentice: You must secretly monitor at all times whether there is any "private entry of enemy goods" or "disguised domestic goods camouflaged to pass as enemy goods" in the store. Once discovered, you can anonymously report it to the relevant national salvation organizations so that a thorough investigation can be conducted; but you must strictly maintain secrecy to avoid the risk of losing your job.</p>
<p>Whether the above three points are appropriate, I hope readers will express their great opinions. Lu Fengzhao, December 5th</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>We came to the store to work as an apprentice in order to solve the problem of earning a living. Naturally, we cannot help but be conscientious in our duties all day long. From this point of view, wouldn't it be that we have no spare time to take care of other things? "Can we allow the enemy who is killing our compatriots and invading our territory" to run rampant in our country? No, absolutely not! ··· Then should we take up spears and guns to drive him out? No··· Taking up spears and guns to drive him out is certainly the only way out; but if we act as an apprentice in this old-fashioned store, we are subject to all kinds of constraints and it will naturally be very difficult to do so.</p>
<p>However, within the scope of what is possible for us, there are "many ways" in which we can fulfill the obligations of a citizen of the Republic of China and engage in the work of resisting Japan and saving the nation. For example: everyday appliances: purchase domestic goods as much as possible. For food and clothing, do not purchase enemy goods; and even more so, do not sell enemy goods. Every time you have free time, going to amusement parks, smoking, drinking and other waste: you may wish to deduct a tenth of it each month to donate to the northeastern anti-Japanese heroes. If you encounter your friends, fellow villagers, relatives, or those who lack knowledge: you may wish to verbally publicize the various inhuman and vile acts of the Japanese pirates! So that all our compatriots will deeply imprint in their hearts the impression of a "foreign devil as our enemy"! All of these are easy to do, without any loss to individuals. Patriotic comrades will surely express their sympathy. If everyone in the business community can implement this, there is no way it will not be effective! At the same time, we "can fulfill the obligations of a citizen of the Republic of China and engage in the work of resisting Japan and saving the nation."</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by Hu Mianong, December 5th</p>
<p>There is no need to talk loftily about resisting Japan; it is necessary to practically save the nation. However, to save the nation, one must first save the local area; to save the local area, one must first save one's own family; to save one's own family, one must first save oneself. Is one's own knowledge and ability worthy of such a major responsibility? If not, one must remedy one's own knowledge and ability. If one's own family is so economically oppressed that it cannot recover, do you feel the pain of your parents and wife? If not, you must first alleviate the oppression of your own family and ensure that your parents and wife have adequate needs in life. Take another look at the fact that there are many, many poor compatriots in your own village. How do you help them move towards a path of joy? In short: Don't set your ambitions too high or too far away. Choose what you can do within your ability and do your best. This is the true way to save the nation. If this is the case, then even if you do not resist Japan, you are already resisting it! Yao Kuangsheng's Answer</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although the rain was pouring down like a waterfall, I didn't need to get wet at all because I had a rain hat, a raincoat, and a taxi readily available for business trips. I went from the office to the entrance of the alley in Ping An Li where you live. My heart was jumping like boiling water, and I got out of the car very slowly. At that time, the wall clock in the cigarette shop at the entrance of the alley was striking twelve. Noon on Sunday, September 10th.</p>
<p>Having decided to leave, why did I brave the rain to come here? Needless to say, the purpose was naturally to have one more meal at your house—to eat one last meal, to bid you a final farewell.</p>
<p>Speaking of "final farewell," I can't help but express some profound words that are enough to infuriate myself. To speak frankly: on the battlefield of a love triangle, when one of them suddenly expresses his intention to painfully give up love and head towards the object of his love to say Goodbye, it is less of a "final farewell" than a last-ditch effort, a do-or-die battle. He is by no means sincerely prepared to sacrifice, by no means passive; he is still struggling, still fighting. He just wants to change his method and use "death" or "running away" as a threat to snatch his loved one from the hands of his rival!</p>
<p>At that time, I didn't need to deny that that's exactly what I was thinking!</p>
<p>"Uncle Zhu······Eh······Uncle Zhu······Hahaha····!" But Zhou Dajing got the better of me. As soon as I jumped into the alley, I found a barrier stronger than a barbed wire mesh sandbag: what was that? That was your lovely "Little Rose." She was in Wu Ma's arms, holding a paper umbrella, aimlessly admiring the symphony of rain and human voices. She saw me as usual and opened her small mouth to laugh. At the same time, she stretched out two small arms as white as jade carvings and waved at me constantly. She was really as lovely as a little angel, and I frantically kissed her small cheeks in the heavy rain.</p>
<p>"Uncle····Uncle····Come·····Mama····Good!" These two short sentences of Zhu Chengwen that I was used to hearing were lightly uttered from her two lips, as bright as red roses; as soon as they met the air, they immediately transformed into the electric light emitted by an X-ray lamp, leaving me no room to escape and nakedly revealing the sinister thoughts I harbored.</p>
<p>"If the truth were as perfect as my fantasy—if you really jumped out of Dajing's house and followed me away—then wouldn't this "Little Rose" immediately become a "motherless child"? How sad would she be? How pitiful? ···" My thoughts suddenly took a turn, shifting towards moral considerations.</p>
<p>The arm with which I was holding Little Rose's little hand was shaking as if electrified. I don't know where the hot tears came from, but they jumped out of my eyes and dripped little by little on her golden, silky hair.</p>
<p>"Uncle Zhu···Uncle···Haha····Boy wants!" She meant that she wanted me to go in with her.</p>
<p>She won! The tense and sharp air was forcing me to retreat. I frantically threw away my rain hat, tore off my raincoat, and forgot everything as I rushed into the rain, where every drop was as big as a walnut. I don't know how much time passed or what places I went through, but I finally ended up decorated by the rain as a drenched drowned chicken, perched in a Russian restaurant on Avenue Joffre, drinking ice cream like crazy.</p>
<p>Speaking of drinking ice cream, I was reminded of the memorable old scene of this summer when you and I were fighting over ice cream at the Gaogiao seaside.</p>
<p>That day, I don't know what wind changed direction, but that level-headed, lethargic Zhu lawyer of yours suddenly had a whim and actually took the lead in enthusiastically proposing to go to the Gaogiao Seaside Bathing Beach; of course, I was the most enthusiastic supporter of this proposal. Unexpectedly, he then issued an order, assigning you to take care of Little Rose at home; as soon as he said this, I was as disappointed and uncomfortable as if I had been sentenced to life imprisonment. However, my beautiful piglet, am I not a famous character full of quick wit? A character full of quick wit will never be embarrassed. While I was disappointed, I was already planning a strategy for how to escape halfway—escaping halfway is my number one forte in life. Fortunately, there were two other characters nearby who were good at adding fun, and they had already withdrawn Dajing's order by means of rape and escorted you out the door.</p>

<p>— Yi Lie</p>
<p>Excerpt from *My Trip Abroad*</p>
<p>In 1931, when Chaplin returned to London from Hollywood, he received a total of more than 73,000 welcome letters in the first three days, averaging 1,111 letters per hour. To deal with the mountains of letters, Chaplin hired half a dozen temporary secretaries to open them.</p>
<p>Among these many letters, more than 28,000 were requests for charity. The amounts requested ranged from four dimes to four thousand dollars.</p>
<p>According to the explanations in these many letters, Chaplin had 680 parents in the UK. And they were all still alive, and the people who wrote to him said they were all cousins. Some even sent extremely detailed family trees as proof. Among the many charity requests, one was written like this:</p>
<p>"Mr. Chaplin! This letter contains the pawn ticket for my grandmother's gold tooth and silver teapot. You can see that the deadline for the pawn ticket has already expired yesterday. So please redeem it for me. As long as you pay the interest, you can renew the pawn date. Please, please! This way, my grandmother's mouth will have a day to welcome the gold tooth back. We have not been able to show our faces in front of our neighbors since my father pawned the silver pot to buy beer! From Little Friend"</p>
<p>Here are some of the most interesting letters:</p>
<p>"I, the undersigned, express my heartfelt welcome to Mr. Chaplin. I have arranged to come to shave Mr. Chaplin's beard on Sunday, September 11th, at your convenience. Sincerely, XX."</p>
<p>Another letter reads:</p>
<p>"Oh, admirable and enviable Mr. Chaplin, if you have any old leather shoes, please be kind enough to give me a pair, and I am willing to exchange them for a gold bracelet."</p>
<p>In Paris, a cinema asked him to sign the movie tickets, because all the signed tickets could be sold for one hundred francs each, and they were still "in short supply."</p>

<h3 id="e179">On *Breaking the Record* <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>After the many-big-star-studded *Radio Big Broadcast*, the screen at the Grand Theatre has been lively for several days. Since yesterday, it has changed to *Once in a Lifetime* (*Breaking the Record*). It is said to be another good work co-starred by many famous actors. So the front of the Grand Theatre is as lively as it has been for the past few days!</p>
<p>This story is adapted from a very famous script. It tells the story of a lucky guy who was originally an actor on the stage. Because the talkies were booming, he made an appointment with two colleagues and went to Hollywood. After some twists and turns, he unexpectedly succeeded. From then on, he rose to prominence, gaining both fame and fortune.</p>
<p>In terms of its plot, it would indeed be better to use the original name *Hollywood Happiness*. The Grand Theatre uses the empty *Breaking the Record* as the film title advertisement, which is of course easier to attract people, but it is too far from the main topic.</p>
<p>In films produced in capitalist countries, it is inevitable that there will be class colors. So American films, especially those with a comedic nature, will not be exceptions; this film takes this ready-made path. The god of fate turns a lucky guy who is completely incapable into a big shot, winning the laughter of the audience in an economic society. This is also a clear expression of the American tendency to always have a fluke mentality.</p>

<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>Howard Hughes, a wealthy Hollywood producer, is now planning to work for American Airlines. When he went to the company to apply, he changed his name to Charles W. Howard. He passed the exam completely, and the company has approved him for a pilot position. In the future, he also plans to use his experience in the sky to write a script and shoot an aviation film.</p>
<p>Thelma Todd's bed is the most spacious among Hollywood stars. It is about nine and a half feet wide and has two telephones on each side. She and her lover Pat de Ciccio each use one.</p>
<p>After completing her latest film, Roucho, Florentine Bros intends to go to China with her husband, John Gilbert, for their honeymoon.</p>
<p>In this so-called comedy, all the laughs are hidden in the dialogue and small actions. As a whole, it is just a comedy. However, director Russell Mack used his cleverness and worked very hard at satire, depicting the fickleness of the world and a kind of despicable behavior of wolves pretending to be tigers. I think; don't think it's funny, it's sad. In today's society, it can be seen everywhere, but we usually don't pay attention, and we can't see the specific facts!</p>
<p>The camera work is very clever. The lighting is also good. The transitions are very powerful. The overall organization and performance of the film are excellent. There are many small insertions, and the places where they are used are appropriate, adding a lot of interest.</p>
<p>Several actors perform a kind of intense emotion in a cold and witty way, sometimes making people feel indescribable—it's not simply laughable. Jack Oakie is certainly good. Even the other supporting roles are impeccable.</p>

<p>— Chen Zhengfan</p>
<p>Not abiding by public order—this is a virtue of our noble people. Leaving aside everything else, just the scene in front of the ticket office of the movie theater, where people charge and crash, forming a tsunami of humanity, waving their fists and sleeves, and desperately rushing to be first, is enough to see! The backwardness of the national cultural level is so great that it makes people sigh!</p>
<p>"I" have never been abroad, so I dare not talk about the situation in foreign countries. During my summer vacation this year, I traveled north and lived in Tianjin for a month. In the evenings when the lights were on, I often went to the Grand Theater to watch movies. There, a wooden sign was hung high above the ticket office, with the words "Please Line Up" written on it. All the people buying tickets (both Chinese and foreigners) had to line up in a long snake formation according to the order of arrival, and buy tickets one by one in order. There was absolutely no mutual crowding or scrambling for the front. As a result, the staff members were refreshed and efficient. In just a short time, everyone was able to buy their tickets.</p>
<p>Owners of all large and small movie theaters in Shanghai, in order to make it easier for your own staff to do their jobs, and in order to cultivate the habit of abiding by public order among the people, may I ask you to implement this in the same way?</p>

<h3 id="e182">Ramon Novarro's Success Story (Part 1) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Meng</p>
<p>Fourteen years ago, Ramon Novarro was still a nineteen-year-old boy. He crossed the border from Durango, Mexico, into the United States to try his luck. When he went to the United States, in addition to youth and strength, he had incomplete English; he had no money and no friends. But he came to the United States regardless. At that time, the war between the United States and Mexico had ended not long ago, and the people of the two countries harbored resentment and hated each other. Therefore, Ramon Novarro's departure from Mexico to the United States was strongly opposed and worried about by his family. When Ramon arrived in the United States, from the snobbish perspective of the Americans, he was just an ordinary immigrant.</p>
<p>But Ramon is a very strange person. He is used to making a living in adversity and suffering. If you tell him that he cannot do something, he will listen to you, do it for you, and prove you wrong. He relies on this method and believes that he has divine assistance in resisting people. This courage of course helped him succeed.</p>
<p>At that time, the salaries of movie stars were not as high as they are now, but he once said: "If other actors can earn a thousand dollars a week, I can also earn a thousand dollars a week." At that time, he probably only earned a thousand copper coins a week, because he had just gotten some things to do.</p>
<p>After Ramon arrived in the United States, he joined Marie Mulligan's dance troupe, and when he had nothing to do, he was bound to find something to do. At that time, he did not have a definite goal, but he believed in himself and that he would definitely succeed in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e183">War Films and *The Lost Soldiers* <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Zhai</p>
<p>During the scarlet fever epidemic of silent films, war films on the screen seemed to be dominated by *The Flower of the Battlefield*. When talkies suddenly rose, this glory seemed to be taken over by *All Quiet on the Western Front*. Scientific slaughter, in the electric light and shadows, still has the possibility of grabbing the minds of movie fans. Recently, the domestic film industry has also been infected with this terrifying and dangerous disease, but the facts prove that there is always a huge difference compared to imported goods. No wonder, this is due to the lack of materials, science, skills, and everything else. Perhaps an equal result can be achieved after a few years. Recently, in the domestic film industry, there are several well-known staff members who have jointly founded a film company, gathered various talents, and used extremely clever and great ideas to shoot a military film. The name of this film is called *The Lost Soldiers*.</p>
<p>The theme of *The Lost Soldiers* includes "loyalty, courage, filial piety, and righteousness." It takes the battlefield as the background, the secret work in the battlefield as the center, and then uses love to set off filial piety and righteousness. Chen Tian, the director of this play, himself is a cadre who once presided over secret work during the war. The real situation of the plot is a true depiction of his personal experience, more tragic than slaughter, and more dangerous than hand-to-hand combat, but you will not see any cruel images.</p>
<p>After the release of Lianhua's *Humanity*, moviegoers seemed to have a desire for appreciation. The birth of *The Lost Soldiers* may satisfy you even more. Now, it is said that the film is more than half completed. The military part is assisted by a certain army, which is actually more real than pretending.</p>
<p>We are eager for domestic films to produce better war films. We hope that *The Lost Soldiers* will have better results. We are looking forward to it here.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Our Young Male Leads <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Shen</p>
<p>In recent years, Chinese films are said to have been revived!</p>
<p>The martial arts genre of *Burning XX Temple* and *Breaking XXX* has finally disappeared from the market, and what has replaced them is the butterfly genre of films. Although some people are trying their best to advocate for the masses and for the nation, in fact, they are rarely seen, and even when they exist, they are forced.</p>
<p>The fact is that it is the turn of the butterfly genre; the position of the young male leads cannot but be important.</p>
<p>"Young male leads"—young male leads who make men envious and women intoxicated; you are also pioneers on the road to the revival of film. I hope that you will not indulge in wine and sex, but work hard to build the foundation of the Chinese film industry. With your hard work, there is no doubt that in the near future, you will make this silent world of young male leads shine brightly!</p>
<p>I think the following young male leads still have some status in the film industry; I have never met any of them, and I am only writing my piecemeal thoughts based on the impressions on the screen.</p>
<p>Jin Yan: He was previously in the Nanguo Drama Club, replacing Chen Ningqiu's position. He had already enjoyed great fame on the stage. The disadvantage at that time was a pair of strained eyes; but when he got to the screen, a pair of slightly open eyes (?), on the contrary, made the girls even more intoxicated. Recently, he has been promoted to the throne of emperor. He has a strong body, and his expressions can also be brought into full play. In fact, his fame is not due to this, but to the good director's script and good supporting actors that made him like this.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli: He was first discovered on the screen in *Wild Rose*. Later, after being discovered by Sun Yu, he was made the leading role in *Volcano Love Blood*, and recently he played the leading role in *Struggle*. Both have received good reviews.</p>
<p>Zhu Fei: His specialty is playing weak and sentimental men. His history on the screen is very long. Since Mingxing reopened, he has started to serve as the young male lead, with only a few retirements in between; he has no stable position. Since he went to jail in the north last year, he hasn't been heard from. I hope he will work hard to climb back onto the film stage in time.</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoqiu: I have heard some old ladies say that he is good, but I can't think of what he is good at. Ying told me: "Isn't his fair and plump appearance and sincere and dull attitude the son that old ladies love in their hearts?" My feeling is that Zheng Xiaoqiu's handsomeness seems to have left the era.</p>
<p>Gong Jia Nong: The wrinkles on his forehead are not without a feeling of a beauty's fading years; however, his expression is very good. If there is a good script, and he plays a person around thirty years old, his achievements will be considerable. Those who have seen *Songstress Red Peony* and *Tearful Smile History* will definitely think that what I said is correct.</p>
<p>Sun Min: Some people say that this guy is a barber. Perhaps it is because when he puts on Western clothes, his head often stretches on top of him. I dare not compliment him on his handsomeness, but his body is just right. If he can put more research into his facial expressions and remove the colors of civilized drama from his actions, he can also be a very good young male lead.</p>
<p>Ma Lou Fen: A horse, though ugly, is fragrant everywhere. Isn't it strange? Mr. Ma, please don't be angry. Isn't your lullaby very popular? You should still give up the effort of painting and specialize in music.</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei: His *Pink Dream*, *Southern Spring*, *Going to the National Crisis* and Jin Yan can almost stand side by side. What he is inferior to Jin Yan is that he cannot thoroughly understand the meaning of the plot, so sometimes the facial expressions do not work.</p>
<p>Chen Yitang: A twenty-one or two year old guy with a thin chin. I have only worshiped his film once, so I dare not determine. Then I don't know about Chen Qiufeng Wang Chunyuan.</p>
