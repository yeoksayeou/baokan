<p>時評</p>
<h3>對日交涉方針之質疑</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>昨評旣已檢視日本最近之對華政策。今請更進一步。論列我國對日是否尙有交涉之可言。</p>
<p>夫不宣而戰。不崇朝而佔取我半壁山河。更肆其橫暴。徧處挑　。淞滬再變。茶毒之慘。凡有感覺。莫不髮指。此種情况。如在世界其他任何一國。則亦惟有絶交而已耳。宣戰而已耳。土地被掠奪。人民被奴隷。鐵蹄壓境。砲火轟炸。更有何交涉可言。然而我政府則終始旣不敢言絶交。尤不敢言宣戰。而所謂「一面交涉一面抵抗。」亦爲徒託空言。事實上恰爲不戰不守不和。一切聽其自然。此則世界僅有之現象也。</p>
<p>今满洲僞國旣已成立。滅亡東北之計劃之第一着。旣已實現。彼日人前此高呼满洲爲其「生死綫」者今且拍掌歡呼慶幸其「生死綫」之奪得。慶幸其明治遺策之實行。肥　旣入　口。而欲以甘言媚辭。或且屈膝乞憐。哀求其吐出。則雖三尺童子。亦都知其爲决不可能。然則處於當前情勢之下。我國對日。固又有交涉之可言耶。</p>
<p>即如論者所云。目前對日交涉方針。應根本承認前幣原外相提出之五項基本原則。應根本承認民四迫訂之二十一條。應遠囑將來確定遠東兩大民族可以實行共存共榮的基礎。然而就目前之情勢而觀。此種屈服之外交方針。究是否能激發日人之覺悟。是否能令日人心满意足。是否能討回一「除非满蒙遷移至大西洋上。除非满蒙不與日本並存於此天地。否則即神起而奪之。亦不可能也。」日人在未佔取東北之先。即已下如此之决心。而謂旣佔有東北之後。反肯吐出此一　肥肉乎。若日本人而尙有東北可以交涉歸還之始念者。則此次顧維鈞氏隨調查圑去日。日人何以堅决表示拒絶。是其絶不願再提及東北問題。不願改變東北之現成局勢。換言之。即不願吐出此一肥　。蓋彰彰明甚。我國即屈意交涉。其如日人之不理何。</p>
<p>再退一步言。就令接受幣原之五項基本原則。承認民四之二十一條。承認日人在東北之一切不正當之權益。而能從日人之手中討回東北。然而如二十一條中之所要求。東北領土行政之主權。顧尙得謂爲「完整。」而此遠東之兩大民族。更寗能謂爲「共存共榮。」逞日人之野心。日本固「存」矣。固「榮」矣。中國果能共存乎。果得共榮乎。誠如論者所云二十一條。事實上多已實現。則又何必爭此名義而不予以承認。吾人則亦可曰。今事實上旣已爲日人所佔有矣。又何必爭此名義而不正式拱手奉送乎。夫二十一條之簽訂爲迫於武力。其事實上多已實現。亦爲迫於武力。譬如盗刦財物。刦則刦矣。但被刦者决無人肯承認其刦之爲正當。更决無人肯承認盗刦之財物即應爲盗所有。被刦爲迫於暴力。而承認刦之爲正當。則鐵案旣鑄。在國際上吾人將永無可以爭辯之餘地。爲國家人格計。爲民族生存計。就令東北而眞能以此而收復。然而吾人總不能不堅持此二十一條之不能承認。蓋立國之民族精神。决不容全部拍賣也。</p>
<p>然則對日外交方針究應如之何。則曰。處今日情勢之下。對日决無外交之可言。尤無方針之可定。亦惟有竭我民族全力以抗禦侵略。收復失地耳。國聯不可恃。外助不可必。今日之事。惟以自力助。乃能自存自救。蓋至顯然。拾此而外。更無他道。更無他策。拼死以求生。庶幾乃得生。若屈辱以偷生。生終不得。且永留不可磨滅之恥辱於史幅。此又吾人所應切實認淯者也。</p>

<h3>皖省財會重要决案</h3>
<p>特種營業稅决議撤消</p>
<p>何財政廳長一氣去皖</p>
<p>蕪湖通信、安徽省政府、以本省財政、已瀕絶境、特在案慶召集全省專家·各縣商會主席·曁有關係之各方、開財政委員會、歷時十餘日、開會六次、特種營業稅、經决議通過撤銷、惟財政廳長何其鞏、竟一氣離省赴滬、今該會已宣告休會、省方對於會議内容、迄未公佈一字、全省商聯會主席吳興周、亦出席該會、今晨返蕪、挾有全會紀錄、其要點如次、</p>
<p>支出突增原因　皖省素稱貧　、百政向取緊縮、乃自陳調元由山東來皖、事事照山東大省之規模布置、以致軍費年增三百萬元、政費年增三百七十萬元、築路年增七十萬元、統計由九百五十餘萬元之支出、一變而爲一千六百三十餘萬、故預算採量出爲入方法、不惜橫征暴歛、亂發庫券、而結果猶不足以濟其窮、卒積欠至四百萬元以去、兹値水深火熱之際、故其勢益爲困難、</p>
<p>取消特稅救民　陳調元任省府主席時、創立特種營業稅、其苛細無異恢復厘金之全部、而流弊且更過之、局卡遍於水陸、商民困擾不堪、院部早已明令撤銷、且該項厘金收入、原屬中央專欵、不在省庫稅收之列、陳調元前旣因浮支驟增、遂不顧民情、貿然征收、然按其稅額、亦僅佔全省收入十分之一五、財委會經决議請省政府將各項收入、實行整頓、再將支出酌減、將此病民害政之特種營業稅廢除、</p>
<p>整舊稅裕收入　自十六年由賦歸省庫收入以後、實收數目及民欠、財廳即未造册報存、以致歷年皆無稽考、此次財委會决議此後仍應查照向例、每届年度終了、造報一次、以爲决算之根據、牲屠牙帖等雜稅、或由縣府代辦、或由商人包辦、皆不能無弊、决設人民稽核機關、由各縣商會設立雜稅監察會、對於該縣牲屠牙帖收數解數、均有稽核之權、如有隠匿及漏稅之弊、該監察會可向財政廳舉發、其章則由財廳訂之、又營業稅全年比額一百十七萬元、自開辦迄今、僅收二十餘萬元、除去坐支經費、到庫者僅九萬餘元、征收之費、遠超實收之數、財委會亦議决請財廳與雜稅合併辦理、以節開支、並加整頓、</p>
<p>嚴稽米糧出口　米糧爲本省出產大宗、豐收之年、出口在八百萬石以外、中稔約六百餘萬石、歉收亦有四百萬石、他如大小麥豆菜子等雜糧、總數與米相等、軍米之出口、尙不在内、以稅率計、年在六百七八十萬元至三百二十萬元之間、乃現定比額、僅一百八十萬元、較最低額相差仍鉅、如此漫無稽考、不但損失稅收、且放行私收、危害民食、此次財委會爲兼籌併顧計、不論軍米商米、議决請財廳直接塡發運照、除軍米外、商米仍照現在稅率征收、商人須逕向財廳請領四聯運照、每照最多塡明一百石、以便商人購不足數時、可以分批出境、無論華商、於米糧購定後、須將護照送交就近商會、加蓋鈐記、由商會截下一聯、彙送財廳查核、及運至查騐處、再將護照送查、平扦平量、照貨相符者、立予放行、照貨不符者、扣留貨物呈請財廳派員會同商會盤查、果係不符、即行充公、稅率預算、最低額可列三百二十萬元、較現在比額約加一百四十萬元、除一百八十萬元已作建築專欵外、增收之一百四十萬元、即爲彌補各項政費之用、</p>
<p>剔除軍費支出　皖省向無軍費之支出、自十九年陳調元率未經中央收編之兩旅兩圑來皖、名之曰省防軍、月支餉項十八萬有奇、加以剿匪費及各項雜費、每月共支二十五萬餘元、臨時服裝、尙不在内、故皖省每年突增三百餘萬元之支出、財委會議决請中央將此項軍費勦匪費、統由國庫支付、以清界限、</p>
<p>以上各項、皆此次會議之最關重要者、餘如節減支出、以符量入爲出之標準、嚴追交代舊欠、以補省府透支欠項等等、均經通盤會商、决議有案、俾决算預算、有所憑藉、惟何廳長旣經離皖、殊不免多生波折、省府主席吳忠信、已電促何氏速返、而於特種營業稅撤銷一項、亦表示力促實現云、（二十四日）</p>

<p>要件</p>
<h3>救農淺說</h3>
<p>— 沈惟賢</p>
<p>蘇浙近十年來。商業日以凋敝。工界亦多恐慌。所未動搖者。耕食鑿飲之老農耳。至今日而農嗟於野。婦歎於室。遂呈岌岌不遑之窘象。或謂由田賦增率。捐稅繁興。此自田主受之。佃農但間接多累耳。或謂由水患損傷。蟲孽侵蝕。此猶諉諸天災。一時之不幸。請言其直接受累。而年復一年。積久逾困者。</p>
<p>其一爲農米之　貴而　賤也。穀生於農。疑若有　而無　者。然農界之鮮蓋藏久矣。每歲東作。儲七八月陳糧以接新穀者。百中之三四耳。自耕田播種·耘草施肥·以迄於築塲登穀。工價之貴。百物之昂。大率種田十畝。成本動逾百金。上農不免稱貸。其次典質。最下者至食月米。（月米者向小米店賒米·逐月結息·至少二分·不論久近·以十個月計息·故不啻四分·）比及秋成。各債固已叢積。幸値豐年。畝收亦不過雙石。果有相當之　價。則償債完租而外。猶有卒歲之資。乃自近三年來。青黃不接之交。米市常逐步騰漲。及秋冬收割之際。米價即逐步低廉。農家於無米之時。旣高價以貸入。而有米之時。乃低價以　出。往往二石不能抵一石。如是積年。循環相乘。耕種力日薄。產穫額日低。而生計之憔悴。亦已極矣。又凡冬間典質之米。向例以清明爲满。蓋恐遲久將霉變也、而今歲清明。軍事方亟。金融停頓。借貸無門。不得已向米舗情商。備價代贖。原當六元數角。現市不及八元。抵完本息外。每石僅收回米袋二支耳。此米脫手。鄉間復少若干存糧。而芒種將至。米價又遽上騰。萬一秋收不登。慘象殊難預測。此亟待救濟者一也。</p>
<p>其一爲棉田連年歉收。而棉價又爲洋紗所擠也。嘉松沿海之區。多植木棉。此田蓋以女工爲之。從前工價旣廉。棉收頗旰。每畝多者百數十觔。少者一組。（七十斤爲一組）而價格較米爲高。棉農常以棉花一組。易白米一石。（此余所親歷）自外洋棉·紗·暢銷内地。縷細質輕。宜於織作。杜棉僅供緯線及絮被之用。其價日以低落。而風蟲水雹霪雨之災。無歲無之。畝收多不過一合而止。（二十五斤爲一合工値物價。則數倍於前。（時雨之後·每日至大洋五六角·且供酒食·）鄉民無力唤工。耘除不徧。則草長而棉荒。以少數之產。獲低廉之資。固宜釋鋤而歎也。或謂當改種水稻。不知此項蕩地。舊係鹹田養淡。厥土宜棉。而地勢又高下不齊。中多滲漏。牛車一具。祗能　水十五六畝。故常分年輪種。以三分之二植棉。三分之一種稻。棉田旣告歉收。水稻又難推廣。濱海居民。生涯艱窘。尤過於粳稻之鄉。此亟待救濟者二也。</p>
<p>其一爲繭商失敗。蠶務瀕危。而農事且受其影響也。杭嘉湖蠶絲。爲大命所係。商業因之擴張。人民於以殷富。由來久矣。然當其盛時。絲商繭商擁倍蓗之利。而蠶農之所得甚微。及其失敗。絲繭廠相率歇業。而田農之恐慌滋甚。蓋育蠶者必先有數畝之桑。準其產力。以爲蟻量。常年收繭一擔。用葉十二三擔。合桑林代價·田地租糧。蠶忙工食·計之。蓋需費二三十金。而得百斤之鮮繭。其買葉養繭者。所費尤鉅。或遭瘟變壞。虧耗不可測矣。每届繭行開秤。價格不齊。平均每擔售得四五十元。八口之家。聚精會神。採繭三四擔。已稱有年。除去成本。不過得銀數十元。故曰微也。然農婦所爲比年繼續。孽孽不厭者。以自春徂夏。農事万興。抒軸旣空。籌措匪易。得數十金之盈餘。始可藉以週轉。浙西土民多種晚稻。待蠶事畢而始挿秧。蓋由於此。今歲蠶汎。始而濕蒸。繼以寒雨。收繭不及五成。若遭抑價。或竟停收。非唯蠶婦興嗟。并田工將何所藉手。此亟待救濟者三也。</p>
<p>爲救濟之策者。對於第一問題。必曰限制市價。嚴禁居奇。此特一時治標計耳。凡物多則錢。少則貴。不可以强制也。古人知穀賤傷農。穀貴傷末。故爲常平社會之法。以時出納。使無甚貴甚賤。乃眞農末兼濟者也。今規復倉儲之令。各縣多未實行。其積有倉欵者。祇圖存典生息。不思貯穀救民。甚至辦理平　。亦按升斗貼錢。以苟且省事。不知農有穀而官爲　收。市情稍長。而民食無妨。農無穀而官爲運　。現米頓增。而居奇自减。消息盈虚之理。恃實物爲轉移。而農民乃並受其賜。但倉儲之制。經始良難。莫如先就農民銀行。增置堆棧。農民得以穀米按市價抵欵。訂期放贖。而酌收輕息。至夏秋青黃不接之間。可令覓取妥保。（或商舗或田主或村長無庸限定農會及合作社以免把持）放借月欵。以新穀抵還。如是於農民確有數便。易賤售爲活典。一也。减重息爲輕率。二也。月欵可以得米。而免商店之盤剝。三也。新穀即以償借。而省礱工之稽延。四也。其銀行雖無大嬴。亦不至虧損。顧名思義。固有應盡之職責。仍由各縣政府。俟今秋成熟。急辦倉儲。出陳納新。使農民不致　貴而　賤。則生計漸蘇。農事亦有起色矣。</p>
<p>第二。木棉衣被海内。固我民之大利也。洋紗人口後。實業家急種墨核鷄脚等棉。並自設紗廠。以圖抵制。始獲嬴利。繼因棉田歉收而失敗。是紗廠之不幸也。各地棉農。爭購廠紗以製布。而不知改良其棉作。是棉農自殺也。蘇浙雨量過多。美棉屢種輒敗。通州常陰等棉。則易蕃植。宜由棉業家播傳種籽。導之栽培。歆以善　。尤在一般社會。提倡大布之衣。以示國奢之儉。彼洋紗絲光紗。軟美適觀。要不若杜棉之經久。果學校與軍人。咸服杜布。加以絮襖棉被。又涉冬所必需。則用途可以驟增。商販因之輻凑。棉農獲利。因而整治其田疇。產量愈佳。消路亦暢。但能回復十年前之狀况。海濱數十萬窮黎。起諸涸轍而生之矣。</p>
<p>第三。絲繭業之衰落。政府旣稔知之。而令停徵出口稅矣。蘇浙官廳及銀錢業。亦旣籌議合作。互相周轉以維蠶事矣。然愚慮竊有進者。若國外無絲銷之路。則出口稅之停徵。猶虚惠耳。繭商　勉以收新繭。若仍屯積於滬棧。則虧累愈增。來歲更趨絶境。蠶户之恐慌。殊未艾也。夫今世界用絲之國。厥推美利堅。日本絲捷足以推銷。而華商不能與之競。然亦思中國固絲銷之絶大市塲乎。綜四百兆人之服用。應需絲織物若干。不自爲計。而望他國爲尾間。亦已愼矣。在昔繭行未開放以前。鄉民常自澡繭繅絲。上者售之絲行。次者留以自績。衣被全國。而棉綢杜絲綢之屬。蠶婦亦用章身。迨繭商設灶烘蠶。　載以去。鄉民圖便。遂廢織作。絲業家以蠶絲輸出太驟。於廠用有妨也。每届提議擴充繭行。輒爲極端之衝突。省議會亦常起劇烈政爭。蓋絲繭業實有不能相容之點。今則牽連而兩敗矣。推敗　之由。固同國外滯銷爲要點。而國内有絲而不售。尤爲腹心之憂。其所以不售者。則人造絲織品喧賓奪主。實佔一大部份。一般社會。以其廉價而美觀也。迺競趨之。彼身骨較脆。歲必更新。而推銷愈速。華貨若線春若杭紡湖縐。堅靭力可支三數寒暑。而價格較高。人每望望去之。乃上流高貴之服。則又鄙夷土貨。而别用舶來之細呢毛葛　嘰等類。價且倍荇蓗於華綢。二者交相棄。乃有此不良之現狀。今農村蠶媪。猶有存者。繅車織級諸具。雖缺而可補。應由各鄉長勸令農婦。各自繅絲。旣便待價而沽。亦可引機自織。尤望政商各界。倡製常便諸服。槪用國貨絲呢及各色平綢。昔謝安石手捉蒲葵。都下頓銷五萬。一物之微。明效可覩。况華絲本屬優良。色樣又不難倣製乎。其絲織廠特捐旣免。絲價復平。當更製各種花綢。以與人造絲競美。今之社會。生活力日絀。虚榮心轉增。揣其喜用人造絲之心理。而益以華絲之耐久。不脛而走。可斷言也。商銷穏順。即蠶務亦自向榮。此於蘇浙關係甚鉅。而一經提倡。不難挽大宗之出欵。自救其同胞。非維農界具瞻。亦奉持民生主義者。當亟先措手也。</p>
<p>綜上三端。蓋民生衣食所需。不可一日離者。惟賢植棉於奉賢之布區。種稻育蠶於嘉興之南鄙。一十九年矣。就耳日所親歷。前後十年間。菀枯不同。遂至於此。失令弗圖。將有魚爛而難爲收拾者。心所謂危。而輙貢其愚。惟當局及各界人士實圖利之。</p>

<p>我和小弟弟摘抄好了，便把一個個的意義查清楚，問明白，然後開始討論。我說：「樊遲問種田問種菜可算是一個關心農事的學生，不過他是問錯了人。向一個讀書人問這些事有什麽用處呢？」小弟弟說：「孔子說他種田不如老農，種菜不如老圃，倒是老實話。知之爲知之，不知爲不知，也不失爲先生之態度。可惜孔子没有勉勵樊遲去向老農老圃請敎，反而背面駡他啻是警告他的三千學生。他只希望他的弟子在禮義信上做功夫，好去做官，不要他們在種田種菜上去考究。凡在種田種菜上考究的都要像樊遲一樣碰釘子，都是没得出息的小人。」「但是當南宮适拿禹稷親自種田而得天下一段故事問孔子的時候，孔子爲什麽不回答？爲什麽又在背後稱贊南宮适爲君子？」「禹稷躬稼是古代傳下來的故事，孔子不能否認。禹稷不是平常的老農而是做了皇帝的老農，自當另眼看待。同是問話人，樊遲是一個小學生，南宮适是一個大官，不能没有分别。假使樊遲是個大官，南宮适是個小學生，我猜想那君子和小人的毁譽是要換一個拉次。否則這種矛盾是不可解釋的。」「孔子說君子謀道不謀食。那末謀食不謀道的是小人，一面謀食一面謀道的豈不成爲半君子半小人嗎？請問君子不謀食，食從那裏來？孔子的意思是，學道吃不了，耕田要挨餓。學道吃不了的是君子。耕田要挨餓的是小人。不種穀而吃飽飯的自稱爲君子；種穀而没飯吃的反被駡爲小人，這是何等的不公平！」「照孔子的理想看來，一國之中不能盡是君子。如果盡是君子，便没人謀食，没人耕田，君子想要餓死了。在他的社會中必須有一部份人專門耕田，耕田的人要把自已餓得瘦瘦的使君子可以養得胖胖的坐在那兒管他們。這種瘦已令人肥的人是被駡爲小人。」「孔子駡農人爲小人。農人的嘴也没有放他過去。你看『四體不勤，五穀不分，孰爲夫子？』十二個字是駡得多麽兇呀！可見得當時的農人和孔子是没有好感。」「但是爲什麽一直到現在中國的農人總是崇拜孔子，並且在每一個私塾裏是供奉着他的牌位？」我們想不通，朱先生說：「孔子是地主的代表。『謀道不謀食』是有地租收可以吃現成飯。私塾是地主的麻醉機關。帝王與地主拿孔子做偶像，孔子的好吃懶做一心想升官發財的門徒又到處宣傳，農人經過二千多年這樣的麻醉，所以弄得糊裏糊塗。」好，牌位的問題是不成問題了。</p>

<h3>鐵次曾仲鳴談擴展全國鐵道計劃</h3>
<p>滬戰兩路損失二千餘萬</p>
<p>决由外部當局主持交涉</p>
<p>鐵道部次長曾仲鳴氏、昨晨因公由京抵滬、當晚即匆匆返都、華東社記者昨訪曾氏於寓次、與談中英發展全國鐵道計劃、兹分誌如次、</p>
<p>潼西鐵路　據曾氏談、中央最近致力於全國鐵道之擴展、現在計劃進行中、共有四處、其一爲潼西鐵道、係由潼關而逹西安、共計需費逹一千四百餘萬、築路經費、現尙在籌措之中、此路爲關中要道、一旦完成、便可與隴海路銜接、成爲關中唯一之幹道也、</p>
<p>粤漢鐵道　其次爲積極完成粤漢鐵道、粤漢鐵道之進行、已不自今日始、特悉未能早日完成耳、該路建築費、已經决定由庚欵中指撥、惟係分期撥付、年期悠久、實屬緩不濟急、故現已决定以此項指撥之欵爲担保、向他方籌借、决定於四年中完成全路、該路建築費、約計需五六千萬金左右云、</p>
<p>大潼鐵道　此外現在計劃進行中者、有大潼鐵道與石沽鐵道、大潼鐵道係由晋省之大關而至潼關、　　日與潼西隴海兩路聯絡、此在運輸交通軍事各方、均爲不可或緩者、而此項路　充成後、西北邊遠之區、可以朝發夕至、西北　塞之天然產品、亦可從事開發也、</p>
<p>石沽鐵道　至於石沽鐵道、係自晋之石家莊而至大沽、預定與大潼鐵道、同期於兩載内完成、大潼與石沽兩路之需費若干、現方在估計中、建築費係與法商某公司商借、業已商有成議、若干月後、即可開始動工也、</p>
<p>浦口輪渡　關於平浦路與京滬路之聯運事宜、鐵部决定在浦口建築大規模之輪渡、經費計逹百萬、明春當可完成、該項輪渡完成而後、平浦路之聯運、即完全成功、不特商旅稱便、即平浦與京滬兩路發展、亦可預卜也、</p>
<p>兩路損失　至於此次日軍侵滬、兩路之損失奇重、現下尙在調查中、除兩路局負責調查外、鐵部方面、亦派員來滬、帮同調查、預計損失、至少在二千萬以上、該項損失、不特吾國直接受其影響、即中央公司處於債權人地位、亦受相當影響、將來交涉事宜、當由外部主持之也</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯语录</p>
<h3>科學笑話</h3>
<p>— 梅忆</p>
<p>吾來講幾椿科學上的笑話吧。從前人研究太陽爲什麽能發出光來，研究的結果，據說太陽裏有吸鐵石，所以纔能發出光來。證據是；用鐵燒紅了，發出來的光，在暗室裏可以替代太陽光來拍照，這是很好笑的。</p>
<p>還有一件更好笑的故事。西洋古時在化學未昌明前，有所謂鍊金術，和中國從前的黃白術差不多。古人想發財，以爲黃的是金。白的是銀，於是想入非非，天天在黃的東西裏去追求黃金。有一位更是異想天開，他從人撒的尿裏去冲積物，久而久之，才積成了薄薄的一塊，顏色居然玄黃，不禁大喜，疑其有金，恐怕熔化，就浸在油裏，準備永遠保藏着。詎料那塊黃東西浸在油裏竟會發出螢火似的光來，他就不由就不咋舌稱奇。</p>
<p>還有一位也異想天開，想從人撒的糞裏去找黃的結晶，再在黃的結晶裏　去淘出黃金來。他也居然得到了薄薄的一塊，詎料接着鐵管子，就會發出火來。</p>
<p>尿的鍊金家和糞的鍊金家都不知其所以然，面面相覷，默然無言，大家都不知道葫蘆裏賣的什麽藥！其實他們所鍊出來的不是他們心心念念的黃金，而是出乎意料之外的燐石。</p>
<p>科學的發軔，往往從神秘和好奇開端，而科學上的發現也很多在意想之外偶然得之，這裏就是一個很有趣的例子。</p>
<h3>柏林中國美術展覽會籌備紀（上）</h3>
<p>— 白石</p>
<p>國民政府行政院會議通過關於中國美術展覽會之議案：</p>
<p>一九三四年柏林舉行中國美術展覽</p>
<p>會，并擬預備金三萬馬克：聘任敎育部長朱家　驊，中央研究院院長蔡元培，北平研究院院長李石曾，駐德公使劉文島，及陳樹人，葉恭綽，劉海粟，高奇峯，徐悲鴻爲籌備委員。</p>
<p>以現代美術作品在歐洲獨立展覽，此實爲吾國文化事業上空前之盛舉。晚近歐洲藝術之中樞在法都巴黎德京柏林，德法人素來重視藝術，政府倡導亦復甚力。兩地均設有國家美術院及美術學校。每年春秋兩季搜集國中繪畫，彫刻數千公開展覽。美育之宣化，疾如風電；益以各國文藝家羣集其地，攻磨鑑賞之外，各有强固之圑體組織，完成其美。其他各國政府亦以國際文化之故，斥巨資，每年在兩地舉行美術展覽會，銳意宣揚其國之美術。而世人欲瞻國之文野者，亦恒至兩地視其藝術之昇仄爲衡焉。日本蕞爾之國，其藝術遠承我國之傳授，近汲歐西之流沬；論其造詣雖小有可觀，而博大精深，尙不能幾。祇以政府之力量，不惜所費，遴派專員以辦理宣傳。一九二九年春在巴黎，一九三○年春在羅馬，去年春在柏林大規模舉行日本現行美術展覽會。報紙騰載，振集歐人之視線。今吾國能選現代精品赴德展覽，不但不讓日本專美於前，且可使歐人一寛秦無人之短視。</p>
<h3>寂寞的院子</h3>
<p>— 鸚哥</p>
<p>｜故都雜寫之十｜</p>
<p>我搬了好幾次塲，終於在有着槐樹的院子裏住得最長。這院子的構成，也和北京一般的院子一樣，我是選定一間朝南的正屋，屋子裏邊是裱的白紙，雖不富麗，到也整潔，四圍也很清靜，於是一顆怪會受刺激的旅人的心靈，也就很安閒地放定了。最使我高興的是每天朝晨，當　雀歌詠太陽的時候，朝南的紙窗上便有着槐枝的影兒在移動，繁茂的葉子與搖曳的枝條，很自然地構成了窗上的圖案，就是畫出來的都不及他好。我睡在床上就看，一直要看到午餐的時候，那時他的影兒從我的窗上移到了門前長满蘚苔的階石，再移到對面的牆上去。我由此，似乎聽到了時間逝去的脚步，於是我驚嘆了，我驚嘆時間的筆已經在我嘴上畫下了纖細的鬍了。</p>
<p>院子的主人没小孩子，一個女兒也已十幾歲了，並且上了學校，我又不常睡着覺，四圍清寂得一點聲息没有，這，有時固然會助長你的文思，但有時你會被這死一樣的寂寞擲入啼笑皆非的境地的。有一天我正在感歎着自家身世的凄凉，驟聽得隔壁院子裏有一陣激劇的吵閙傳來，衝破了死寂的重圍，細聽時，知道一個粗暴而憤激的聲音是男子的，還有一個尖銳的帶着哭聲的是女子的，他們你一句我一句的釘着，到後的，肉與肉碰擊的聲音便聯珠似的送進耳朶來，女子的哭聲也就驚人地刺進我的心來，我苦着隔開了一重牆，不則眞想勸他們和平點，但是隔牆的聲音格外雜亂而巨大了，似乎女子要尋什麽短見。我這顆多血的心不由得在悸蕩，我認眞爲他們這一幕活劇的結果而憂慮。</p>
<p>也不覺得寂寞，也不知道是什麽地方？我見着人便問「這是怎麽一會事？」可是院主人却淡淡地告訴我：「北方的小夫妻　　　　　　　　　　　　　　天今天晚上就好了，周爺，你可别怕」。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>法京巴黎是時世妝的發源地。女子們裝飾的變化。日新月異。一般時髦的婦女。最近又在頭髮與帽子上弄起新花樣來。頭髮的截法。卷法。燙法。都須與帽子相配合。</p>
<p>日本盛行台球（按即乓乒球）愛玩台球的男女。計有二十萬人。特爲研究而刋行的雜誌叢報。共有四十種之多。</p>
<p>英國有幾個鄉村中。至今還流行着各種古舊而奇怪的治療法。内如熟煤茶一種。即其一例。法將火熱緋紅的熟煤一塊。投在一杯熱水中。給小兒們喝下去。可以醫他們的胃病。</p>

<h3>張大千臨古畫談</h3>
<p>— 韋齋</p>
<p>大千居士。以仿石濤畫有名於時。南自江水發源。以迄於海。北緣泰山。以至長白昆侖。東逹日本朝鮮。凡其藝人盡買。仕宦豪富。收藏好古之家。得石濤畫紙本稍精者。輒詫嘆疑訝。曰豈大千所爲耶。然而大千所爲之石濤。固已充塞乎宇宙。顛倒國内外豪傑。蓋大千爲石濤。不特筆墨貌似。實得其精神條理。故異夫人之爲之者。且石濤之畫。或有出之率爾。未盡美善者矣。而大千之撫擬。則無不聚精會神。毫髮無憾。故大千之爲石濤。殆又忠於石濤之自爲。於是世之鑒别石濤畫者。遂益不易以美惡爲衡。惟大千之能事。猶不止一石濤也。若八大。若天池。若白陽。山水若黃山派諸大師。大千無不喜爲之。偶一效　。足使捧心者轉失其美。夫以膺亂眞。文人狡獪。朋友談笑。亦聊以取樂乎一時。固不足爲訓。然學畫而必先臨古。臨古而必求其維妙維肖。可以亂眞。斯固爲學者必由之途輒。實不可忽焉視之也。吾國學問。類多反求諸古。不僅藝術然也。魯論曰。温故而知新。禮經曰。必則古昔。子雲經師。太玄實擬固易。劉歆大儒。尙書僞爲古文。下之魏晋詩篇。首列擬古雜體。三唐書法。厥有響拓硬黃。蓋必能博古而後可言通今。知撫擬而後可言剏造。苟怱於兹。便成躐等。不可不知也。近年來大千遍游南北山水。尤寢饋於朝鮮之金剛山。歙之黃山。吐納雲霓。俛仰造化。忽忽厭倦撫古。將歸於自然。蓋以藝術過程言。大千之畫。固足以絶依傍而言獨立矣。於是大千檢其舊所撫古山水人物仕女花卉百餘幅。將盡摧燒之。詔朋好曰。吾畫請自昨日死。同人慶其畫之將自開風氣。蔚爲大成。而又惜其舊作勞心思。瘁精力。竭十數年之功。不忍盡棄也。欲請付之展覽。廣結墨緣。在大千固可以坦然示人以其游戲之面目。言藝事者。可以知書畫必由之途徑。以大千之天才。而必先之以仿古。青年有志者。則可由大千之梯階。以上窺石濤八大之奥堂。凡一舉而數美備焉。然而大千固未之許也。吾爲此文。欲使海上愛大千畫者。促成此舉。爲天地間留此妙墨。爲亂後文藝界放一光彩。他日而展會果開。則吾竊比於負嚆矢而前驅矣。</p>
<h3>青島印象記（上）</h3>
<p>— 何公超</p>
<p>霧　　我們所乘的從上海到青島的「明生」輪船，走了兩天三晚之後，忽然停在海裏不動了。據老於旅途的乘客們說：青島已經到了。但是因爲有霧，只好等着。我雜在衆人中，憑着船欄眺望，只見四圍白茫茫地什麽看不見，奸濃重的青島的霧啊。</p>
<p>一會兒，霧薄了些了，啊，對面那一帶碧浪青山，綠林紅瓦，不就是我們所日夜盼望的美麗的青島麽？從半明的薄霧望過去，眞像是一座玲瓏的仙山飘浮於碧海之上。這美景，我從前是只有在詩人的幻想文字裏依稀領略過。可是，多虧有了霧，才幻出這樣空虚飘緲的仙景來。</p>
<p>我後來看「膠澳志」，才知道青島「自四月以迄七月下旬之際，每週恒有一次或數次之濃霧，由海上襲來：：」住在這兒的人則說青島的霧會從窗户裏一陣陣地飛進來，使空氣潮濕，衣服生徽。我這一次在青島住半個月，可没有遇着這樣濃重的霧。不過有一天早晨却看見一陣陣的白霧從空中降落，瀰漫。而黃昏憑窗遠望的時候，只見那本來矗立着的巨大的門燈已經消失了輪廓，唯有一圑淡紅色的暈光浮宕於白茫茫的半空，似乎告訴人它還没有完全被霧陣掩没而已。</p>
<p>令人戰慄的血跡星期日伴着張君夫婦去游「會全岬」砲台的遺跡。這砲台是德國人佔領青島時所建浩大，設備堅固。台上置着二十四生的加農砲兩門，十五生的三門，都可以轉動，人移交青島的時候，或者竊去重要的機件，或者炸毁砲身，已成爲徒供後人憑吊的砲台外圍，壘石爲壁，其中開闢着一道一里多長的地室，地室内有彈藥庫，傷兵室寢室，（那裏面吊床還高懸着咧）升彈機，廚房。（鐵鑊子内還有德國兵遺留下來的得灰屑）</p>
<h3>戎馬雙棲記（九一）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第十一回　偏枯小邑瞻仰牙旌　猥瑣羣流呵從騶</p>
<p>秦掌櫃下意識的抱拳高拱。不覺先碰了自已額角一下。把已昏亂的腦筯徒然碰清楚了過來。就此彎腰俯首。一揖在地。在嘴邊一連串的哆嗦著道。司令大駕遠來。小店理當歡迎。請司令多包含。就賞光給小店到裏面落坐罷。鄔四爺也帮著說道。他姓秦。是這兒的掌櫃我常常照顧他的。無奈我們這小地方尋不著好旅館。只有他這一家還勉强可住。總得請司令委屈些兒呢。安司令點點頭剛待舉步。忽的第二輛騾車上所下來的另一位貴客。也來到安司令的身旁。鄔四爺忙又告知秦掌櫃道。這一位是省公署的胡諮議。與安司令一塊來的。全都有緊急要公。須在此地多盤桓幾時。帶來的人。連我在内。共有八九位。你快收拾寛敞乾凈的屋子罷。秦掌櫃赶忙又施了一禮。使諾諾連聲。側著身兒在前邊引導。把這一千人全領到旅館後進的一間大廳内。高呌茶房前來打洗臉水沏茶。又急急告了個便跑出去。吩咐廚房預備上等酒飯。并派人到馬號照料車輛牲口。直忙得八面張羅。衝進跑出。嚷乾了喉嚨。脹壞了大腿。還兀自感覺有許多事没做得周全。只不住的流汗發急。其實那裏面的二位貴客以及隨從人等。是全仗鄔四爺在一手照料。把上房三開間。讓安司令和胡諮議東西配享。各據一室。他自已偕同幾位有體面的隨員。另到東邊廂房裏去住。又囑咐護兵馬弁。占領了西廂房。但輪流値班。要常川有一個帶槍並穿軍服的。坐守在上房中間那屋子裏供二位大人不時的呼喚支使。兼又權代門崗。以壯觀瞻。及安排妥貼。又親陪著草草用了一頓晚餐之後。已到了初更時分。二位大人因旅途中萬分勞頓。提前休息。各自在屋裏大炕上鋪好　　　　。胡諮議有幾口小癮。并在一證獨對中　霧呑雲悠然自適。</p>

<h3>絲茶廣屬子茶發育未採</h3>
<p>贛屬上饒·鉛山·玉田·河口一帶子茶因旬日來天時得宜、發育異常殷密、洲圍肥茶、樹上　　青葱、不亞頭產、山户以出產良好、極欲採製謀沽、惟因滬市茶銷呆滯、河口紅茶各號早已收塲、營綠茶者、總計河地及玉山鄭家坊樟材街小玉山等處僅有三四家、胃量已满、力難再納、兼今歲頭茶山價又高、售出市盤、俱受虧折故本年子茶、終至老葉荒葉、間有山户不忍任其廢萎、尙多擇優摘製、備銷店莊、據該處茶商統計、今年上鉛玉河四處春茶未採荒老者、約有二三千擔、於農民經濟不無影響云、</p>
<h3>婺源二帮箱茶大批運滬</h3>
<p>婺邑各鄉茶號、自開秤進茶後、均紛紛趕製抽芯、搶新運滬、嗣得出盤低下、又多中道止製、改做普珍、一月來各號除頭字抽珍·貢熙·針·秀·鳳眉等花色、已早運滬外、二次珍眉花色大帮箱茶、又陸續成箱工竣、因贛河徒患仍猖獗、不敢遵水道運輸、連日均紛紛雇伕由旱路挑屯、轉杭裝滬、總計先後啟行者不下四千餘箱、進茶較少之號、月内可以收塲、至夏莊子茶、因天時助長、發育甚厚、質味之香、不减春貨、山户以頭茶多囤滯未沽、觀號方需要胃靳、多不願採製存藏、故截至近日止各鄉子茶、尙少搜製、市面殊形清淡云、</p>
<h3>低莊綠茶暢銷之由來</h3>
<p>自日本珍眉開出新盤五十兩消息逹到摩洛哥後、在滬英國行家、接到訂購日茶定單、有如雪片飛來、蓋其時滬埠低莊珍眉茶價、每擔需價七八十兩、在此世界經濟衰落之際、該處茶商、以日茶價廉、華茶價貴、紛紛捨華而就日、於是上海華洋茶商、互相駭告、深懼摩洛哥華茶地位、從此被日茶侵奪、英商錦隆洋行、以國外茶商、趨向日茶、影響華茶前途至鉅、尤具關心、因特專工製成低莊珍眉新樣、以四十八兩之最低價、電逹摩洛哥、因之國外茶商、又復趨向華茶、對於前發日茶定單、一律撤消、是以邇來温州玉山等路低莊珍眉、交易異常旺盛、號家對於子茶、亦均積極搜辦以應銷售云、</p>
<h3>上週絲市仍難進展</h3>

<p>上週中本埠洋莊絲市、仍乏進展之趨勢、里昂雖有廠經現貨之需要、而來價不高、日絲商聞信分起抑價侵銷、致滬市幾若曇花之一現、週間即告沈靜、價反猛跌、紐約英倫等處因日絲不顧成本、祗須遠價即售、華絲已被侵銷殆盡、美銷等依然停滯、價仍趨疲、江浙綢廠以今歲土絲產歉而質劣、鑒於廠經等價已跌至最低限度、遂乘棧抛購、上週中綢門廠經銷路尙不寂寞、奈市盤不高、且無一百兩之貼費、（政府救濟江浙廠絲商如陳廠絲出口時每包補助銀百兩、廠商因乾繭無處押貸、（銀錢業不做乾繭押欵祗得忍痛抛售、將繭繅絲交解、至已做押欵之陳廠經、因現市售價非僅不敷取贖本息、且須虧　成本五百餘兩、類均擯持不動、情願照加拆息與棧租、蓋一經出售、貨主在絲號或絲棧預支之墊頭銀、（去歲廠經上棧時絲價在一千兩左右、絲號或絲棧每包預付墊頭銀在八百餘兩、）以及絲號及絲棧將該絲所做之押欵本息等不敷之數、均須清償、故難即售、此皆不景氣之時勢所造成也、上週中海外華絲價跌勢未衰、以里昂爲最、兹將週末市價錄下、（紐約每磅價·單位金元·里昂每基羅價·單位法郎、）</p>

<p>昨日糖市公會市塲劃盤、交易殊寥、但人氣頗挺、荷糖二十四號粗砂白喊價十四兩二錢、高貨十四兩二錢半、香港貨十四兩、買氣閑散、成交零落、趨勢略覺轉平、生砂赤劃十一兩八錢、九號荷赤九兩九錢七分半、八號貨九兩七錢、市形殊堅、太古糖Ｂ嘜十六兩二錢、ＣＷ嘜十五兩八錢、ＤＹ嘜十五兩五錢半、Ｈ嘜十二兩四錢、甚爲俏手ＨＭ嘜喊十五兩、買方尙在觀望、天津來Ｂ嘜振新號售出三百五十包、價元十五兩九錢、實因砠子較輕、包皮破碎、故價較市上相宜也、</p>
<h3>五金霉雨影響成交鮮少</h3>
<p>昨霉雨滂沱、五金交易益覺鮮少、蓋客帮廠家因逢星期、交易不旺、兼之天雨綿綿、茶會及市塲所到人數異常寥落、是以談判不多、開出之貨祗有法西釘一百桶、英鋼板六十担、新舊鉛絲三百餘擔、此外則祗有問津而已、行情一節、殊無上落云、</p>

<p>— 郎德雄</p>
<p>方一二八禍變之初、復旦義勇軍，義憤塡膺，星夜奔投翁旅長，請纓殺賊，更鼓吹十九路軍主戰，得該軍同心協力，屢挫敵鋒，卒以衆寡懸殊，退守安亭，作背城一戰，忽以和約協定，素志未伸，忍痛而歸，本校師生，舉行歡迎大會慰勞之。感賦四絶。</p>
<p>從戎收拾舊山河。不愧書生本色多。彈雨硝烟親洗禮。師生重遇感蹉跎。長虹爲氣鐵爲心。肯把東西陷陸沉。一戰威名震遐邇。春風時雨普天欽。匹馬橫刀不顧身。同賡袍澤有何人。一書換得沙場骨。武穆傷心志未伸。不堪解甲復歸來。淞滬精華付刧灰。漫道金甌完破碎。江城猶有越玉臺。</p>

<h3>不腐漿糊的製造法</h3>
<p>— 爾誠</p>
<p>不腐漿糊的優點｜論起漿糊，是一種日用品，譬如寄信黏物，都要應用，不過用普通方法製成的漿糊，往往易於腐敗，幾天後即不堪復用，並且發生污臭，有碍衛生。况且普通的漿糊黏貼紙張，每每發生縐痕，很難平服，這更使我們不能满意；要解除這種缺點，便要用特製的不腐漿糊，這種漿糊市上雖然有賣，可是價値頗昂，不甚經濟，所以我來介紹給諸位一種化費低廉而効果相同的不腐漿糊，此法經我個人屢次的試騐，認爲很圓满，閱者可依法一試。</p>
<p>原料｜麵粉水楊酸（藥房有賣）蜜（藥店有賣）清水</p>
<p>製法｜先將麵粉包於夏布内，（其他有孔布亦可用，）然後置於清水中，用手不時攪動，則麵粉漸漸溶於水中，成爲白色無黏性之液體，待到此液體十分濃厚、便可將麵粉包取去，包内餘下者，爲含有蛋白質之粉渣，此物則不合製糊之用，可棄之。然後將此液體置於磁器内，（如磁面盆之類，銅器不可用，蓋恐糊變綠色，不雅觀也。（用文火（即火焰不烈之火）加熱，上面用棒攪動，則白色之液體，漸漸成熟，帶有黏性，於是加蜜少許，（不加亦可）至此便可試其製成與否。試法可將蘸有糊之攪棒提高，倘糊滴下連續不斷而如牛皮糖者即成。（按此全憑經騐，很難說得明白，這是一種試騐方法而已。）待其成功，便將容器取下，至半冷時，加入水楊酸若干，用力拌和，即成不腐漿糊矣。如嫌太薄，可再加熱，將水分蒸發。</p>

<h3>如此朋友</h3>
<p>— 蓓蕾</p>
<p>記得在ＸＸ中學求學時代，我曾經幸運地結識下這麽幾個闊朋友：</p>
<p>一位是海上某洋行買辦而家裏擁有二輛八隻汽缸的Buick者之兒子陳君。</p>
<p>一位是Ｗ君，他的父親曾任山東顯宦，現在雖已物化，遺下的民脂民膏，恰歸他承繼。所以對於經濟這一個問題，他是絶對不曾閙恐慌的。而據他自已說；現政府要人中他也有好幾個認識。</p>
<p>一位是崑山顧亭林之後，是一個十足的少爺，也是絶對的romantic。青年</p>
<p>還有三位是被稱爲情塲三傑的Ｙ和Ｍ及Ｐ。他們都是公子哥兒；而充分的樂天知命者。</p>
<p>這幾許少爺們都肯屈節下交我這位十二分Sentimental無產階級者，在當時，眞的，我自已也覺得「受寵若驚，」而時時自炫其「知遇之高」。</p>
<p>「少爺」，這麽偉大的人物，對於功課無疑的不屑去讀，特别對於國文是以爲不需要讀。所以不做作文或是不考國文則已，否則的話，保險會用命令式的請求，來呌我負責於一小時在做完，而買辦之子和三傑之一的Ｙ，連寫都不肯寫，有幾時竟不進敎室，橫堅像睡着般的Ｘ老夫子，對於學生是你說怎樣就怎樣。「敎室門雖設而常開」，學生也「川流不息」，「往返徒勞」，以至於「不告而辭」。我在這時候，就成爲要人的中心點，打起精神來幹，不擬稿，也不起草，信意之所至而直書，總算一個小時，還終於能交卷。然而統計之下，文課做了至少有五份了。於是我從内心的安慰，覺得自已辦事能力還不差。這樣的誤人自誤，替買辦之子一個人就效勞了至少有二年半，這二年半，換句話說；就是他始終不曾自已做過一點功課，關於全體學科的國文之全部。</p>
<p>然而「朋友」，這是多麽重要的人？朋友的事，怎可有求不允？所以我低下頭，用我本能之力去幹，在他們的請求中，我可說從没使他們失望過一次。</p>
<p>現在怎樣了？唉！「不堪回首憶前塵，」總之，「如此朋友，」到現在使我認識了「朋友如此」。</p>
<p>承認是我不習上，承認是我没出息</p>
<p>，我終於在某一個學期的開始失學了。受了種種隠痛，受了一切磨難；我於是時時痛哭起來。我對不住父母，對不住也許表同情我的人，也對不住一切的人，錯誤只是我的錯誤，痛苦也只是我的痛苦，誰是個眞的知我者？誰是我眞的朋友？或是鼓勵我「振作點，」可是，朋友呀！只你還没知道我的心。</p>
<p>爲自已謀一條奮鬥的途徑，於是想起了闊朋友，用求乞般的言詞，托他們介紹一件事來做，然而消息如石沉大海，没隻字片紙之賜。時代這樣，人多於事吧？是的，事雖有而不美吧？也許又是的，然而朋友，你難道不能給我些同情？人與人之間，要是没有同情，生存還有甚麽價値？啊！啊！朋友，我知道了，窮人和富人就根本不配結朋友吧！可是不是我說句「施人欲念」之語，朋友也想想執卷求代之時嗎？</p>
<p>我漫步於灰色旅途之上，不知於那一天會能得到人生眞義的甘泉；我也不知是否有一個人會和我同來流一下眞摯的淚？我這Sentimental無產階級者，唉！</p>
<p>生夢死</p>
<h3>舞塲感言</h3>
<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>上海人特别聰明，旣有所謂「娱樂救國」，又有跳舞忘記國難的同志們。享樂，麻痺的民族，永遠是醉夢。國難愈深重，跳舞的人反愈多，這眞是頽廢民族很好的一個例證。</p>
<p>上海舞塲的勃興，三數年可謂普遍極了。晚上蹀　在街頭，東也是悠揚的弦聲，西也是舞踏的音樂。「麗安」電炬，紅的一圑，紫的一片，黃的一縷，綠的一圈，南也酒排間，北也舞蹈塲。盛哉，今日之上海舞廳也。</p>
<p>考上海人之所以對於跳舞趨之若鶩，大槪有以下的幾種原因。（一）時髦交際；（二）借舞遣悉；（三）肉的追逐。因爲交際塲上跑跑，如果不懂得交際舞的話，那就會被人認爲「阿木林」。燈紅酒錄之中，誰不愛漂亮？</p>
<p>柔和的燈光，柔曼的樂聲，柔媚的肉｜｜所謂曲線美。不得志的英雄，他們在其間流連，擁抱，微笑。於是，一切都得到了安慰。但是軟玉温香懷内，或者是白髮母親殷般垂念游的時候，或者正是妻子流著淚，寄語天涯游子，珍重！</p>
<p>假使我們在醉醒夢迥的時候想想，我們將會啞然失笑，然而我相信，笑還没有止住，我們的熱淚就要滚滚下落。帝國主義者，資產階級的先生們，表示豪闊揮霍的玩藝，無產的青年們，你們心血，淚與汗換來的幾片白銀，輕輕的便送到假笑著的舞女的手裏去了。除掉煩惱，你們得到些什麽？</p>
<p>有爲的少年頭，血　，精神；爲什不好好地整頓起來？爲什不應用到生產</p>
<p>和事業？終朝沉淪，終夕醉舞，國且不談了，生活怎樣持下去？我們游玩在江南，寗不偶然想到東北血泊中的義勇軍在拚命？</p>
<p>舞塲自然是温柔，但是充满其間的，是卑怯，痛苦，罪惡！我們不到戰塲上去，至少也得離開舞塲。據我所知，少年藝術家，失望的軍官，無聊的政客，苦悶的浪人，朋友們，我們到底是不是中華民國的國民？飘　的祖國，我們應不應該盡一點責任？</p>

<h3>心照不宣</h3>
<p>— 士本</p>
<p>江北人小碗子，手裏拿了一個满塗着油膩的木盤，裏面盛着十幾個紅綠彩蛋，和一包一包千色百樣的糖菓，並有一副（白相大世界）的猜謎紙片，再加上一只粗花大碗，在一條弄堂口頭，支起架子，擱上木盤，開始做他日常做慣的馬路生涯，他將這片地盤很小的活動商店，佈置好了以後，就有一般小朋友和那勞工朋友，像煞蒼蠅看見臭肉一般地蜂湧上來，有的玩玩（白相大世界）有的要擲骰子，小碗子就在褲袋摸出六顆將軍，（即骰子）放在碗裏，和這般主顧，賭博起來，本來他盤裏陳設的東西，是做做彩頭，唯一的生意，就是靠那一只碗六顆骰子來過門的。</p>
<p>「四五六」哈哈：「么二三」輸了：他正在和那一般賭客興高彩烈的當兒，忽聽見得得之聲，抬頭一看，面前站着一個穿着制服，手拿木棒的巡捕老爺，正在目不轉睛地注視着他的吃飯傢伙，他是生意做了多年了，所以經騐豐富，門檻很精，現在看見這位巡捕老爺，雖然大駕光臨，但是並不來干涉他的行動，就知道他（明人不必細說）的來意了，馬上將嘴一呶，頭一顚，可笑這位勇糾糾的有槍階級的巡捕老爺，經了小碗子這樣一個神秘的暗示小動作，像煞着了一種退兵咒一般地馬上一個向後轉，輕脚輕手地走開去，小碗子見他走開了，就在袋裏，掏出一把銅板，數也來不及數，約有五六十枚授給身旁一個掮子，用手一指，呌他拿錢派司過去，這個掮子，也早已會意，接了錢飛也似的跑到巡捕老爺面前，貢獻上去，巡捕老爺，本來緩步而行，是等候小碗子的孝敬，現在見目的物來了，於是向這位臨時的行賄代表，嘻的一笑，接受了這個（明人不必細說），仍舊挺腰凸肚地皮鞋得得而去，到另一樣馬路去做第Ｘ次的（明人不必細說）了。</p>
<p>「唉！要死，生意還做得不多幾個錢，小伙倒給他抄去六百多，這種生意，那能還好做啊」，小碗子兩隻眼睛，歡送了巡捕老爺的去路，等到連影子也見不着了，方纔這樣地說。</p>
<p>唉！</p>

<p>在每一條馬路上，你可以碰到一羣羣挾着書包的小孩｜尤其是在上學放學的時候，向那陳列在街頭的出租小書的攤上問。</p>
<p>「有呵，好看的書多着哩！」邢小書攤的老板照例是慢吞吞地帶着誘惑的語調來回答那一班初走上求知之路的小孩們。他從他們那裏一個銅板看一本，一個銅板看兩本的取得了他生命的營養；他們從他那裏取得一些可憐的見聞，來充實那小小的空虚的智識領域。｜他們的關係，就這樣的連鎖起來。</p>
<p>『看呀！混元老祖用綑仙繩捉住妖龍！』</p>
<p>『好，江南酒俠把採花賊嚇走了。』　　當我走過小書攤，看到他們密接地坐在書攤旁的凳子或是木箱上手舞足蹈的閱讀時，我常爲他們歡愉的神情勾引起一些莫名的酸楚。呵，我可憐的閙着智識荒的孩子們，雖說你們是將來的主人，但是在「將來」呵，「現在」這個世界是除外的。誰還管你所受的是神仙鬼怪以及淫穢的敎訓呢？</p>
<p>飢荒着的孩子們！啃罷！這僅有的黑麵包，我又怎忍奪下來呌你們不啃呢｜雖然是我也想給你們一些較好的充飢物。</p>

<h3>剿匪</h3>
<p>— 青萍</p>
<p>昨晚的蚊蟲，因爲天氣更熱，所以格外來得猖獗。牠們什麽都不怕，除非張了帪子，鑽不進去；否則雖點满蚊蟲香，也是無濟於事，祇能儘牠們受用。</p>
<p>我們是睏的「着地舗」，帪子不曾掛。同室六人，同樣地被擾得夜不成寐。約模十一點鐘光景，Ｗ君實在忍耐不住了，惡狠狠地咒詛，嘆氣。綽號呌「死貓」的Ｙ君是素來寡言的，也隨着說：「啊，眞尷　；叮煞人了，總之睏不着！」全室的人都開動談鋒了，索性翻身坐起，開了一個勦匪｜蚊｜緊急會議，討論一切辦法，防止匪勢的蔓延，室員便是會員，没推舉主席，祇大家自由發表意見；秩序紊亂，瞎吵一二，毫没個正式的談决案。</p>
<p>「匪徒很有犧牲精神，和牠們肉搏，祇有吃虧，算不來，最好利用烟幕彈，把牠們緊園室中，儘薫着消滅牠一個盡絶。」Ｓ君的意見。</p>
<p>「這固然是一個很切實的辦法，但是總還不能澈底。大規模聯軍進逼，似乎比較更妥善點。不然，裝起電網｜紗窗｜來，使匪徒無從來犯。」Ｌ君提議，「本席附議｜不過裝起電網，那筆費用很大，非得請求政府｜學校當局｜勉力從事不可；我們的力量有限，决計夠不到。」Ｗ君發言時，照例是那一付手勢，一付腔調。</p>
<p>「現在我們可歸納起來，我們的辦法可分積極和消極的。積極方面講。其原則當然是根本的撲滅，消除。消極方面講，是避免目前的禍害，而最好的方法是掛起帪子來，没有當然要去從速購置。」我說。</p>
<p>「旣然如此，我們亟應有一個嚴密的組織才：現在可分配職務了，大家來推選出一總司令來。」健談的Ｓ君，又是一個有力的提議。</p>
<p>結果，以容貌之酷似而號稱白川大將的Ｈ君，竟當選了剿匪總司令，當時我們便要挾他實行宣誓就職典禮。</p>
<p>Ｙ君祇最初說了一句，回頭便鑽在被窩裏，死人都勿關！不知他是怎樣的一付神經系，竟會不怕氣窒，悶熱的。畢竟是一隻死貓，一直不曾開過口。</p>
<p>大家都有些倦了，朦朦朧朧似睡非睡，保持了沉寂。隠約可聞指甲抓癢的微音。</p>
<p>天亮，匪氛稍殺，總算好好的睏了個把鐘頭的覺！</p>

<p>家庭问题</p>
<h3>友人的婚禮</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>眞是糟糕，小孩子亂哭亂嚷的要母親，可是他母親爲了去赴宴會！一個五年前的女同學的結婚禮，由上午十句鐘直到現在快要夜半了還没回來。我眞氣忿，我眞不懂女人的心理；爲了漠不相干的人們的婚宴，却居然忍心放著孩子在家裏哭閙。</p>
<p>没有辦法，只得想盡方法哄騙著孩子，然而仍是哭，仍是嚷，可是仍得等著，耐著心情等了又等，直到她笑嘻嘻的從外面回來。果然，孩子住了哭，然而我是預準著要發脾氣的，但是她居然先來吻了我，這還有什麽好說呢？而且妻已在拉長聲音報告她做客的經過了。</p>
<p>「眞是熱閙喲，比我們結婚闊綽得多哩。一間很大的禮堂，全擺满了貴重的喜幛和美麗的花籃，極大的電光𡅕字，那種光的强度簡直刺得眼睛發痛。客人是多到無數，都是年輕的，漂亮的，尤其是女人没有一個不比我闊綽幾倍。我眞不應該去的，相形之下，眞怪難爲情的，差不多比她家裏的丫頭還蹩脚些。（這時候她有意斜斜的偷瞟我一眼，似乎是無限怨意，可是我也有心低下頭去，分明是要避開眼光。）可是今天的酒席却是蹩脚，幾瓶葡萄酒也是很便宜的。我眞不懂他們爲什麽要在酒飯上打算盤。我送了五元錢的禮，吃這樣的酒眞不合算。：：」</p>
<p>我没有什麽好說，也不想說，只是廳著聽著。然而她仍是興高采烈的在繼續的說，也是訕笑，也是羡慕。</p>
<p>不久，小孩子在床上睡了，於是她也預備著睡，可是當她收拾著衣物的時候，她却驚惶的呌了起來，甚至於急得捶胸跌足，啊！原來她發現那戒指上的寳石落掉了。於是我問：</p>
<p>「你幾時有了一個寳石戒指呢？」</p>
<p>「這是因爲今天要做客所以在李太太那裏借來的呀！現在落掉了，怎麽好呢？」</p>
<p>她快要哭出來了。：：</p>

<h3>Questioning the Policy of Negotiations with Japan</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Yesterday's commentary already examined Japan's recent China policy. Today, let's take it a step further and discuss whether our country still has anything to negotiate with Japan.</p>
<p>For Japan to wage war without declaring it, seize half of our land in a short period, and further its brutality with provocations everywhere, leading to another crisis in Shanghai, the poison of which is felt by all, causing universal indignation. In any other country in the world, this situation would only lead to severing diplomatic relations, or even declaring war. Our land is plundered, our people enslaved, iron hooves trample our borders, and cannons bombard us. What negotiations are even possible? Yet our government has never dared to sever relations or declare war. And the so-called "negotiating while resisting" is nothing but empty talk. In reality, it is a policy of neither fighting, nor defending, nor making peace, letting everything take its course. This is a phenomenon unique to the world.</p>
<p>Now that the puppet state of Manchukuo has been established, the first step in the plan to destroy the Northeast has been realized. The Japanese, who previously declared Manchuria to be their "lifeline," are now clapping and rejoicing at having seized their "lifeline," celebrating the implementation of the Meiji era policy. Having swallowed this piece of fatty meat, to try to make them spit it out with sweet words or by kneeling and begging for pity is something even a child would know is utterly impossible. So, under the current circumstances, does our country still have anything to negotiate with Japan?</p>
<p>Even if, as some argue, the current policy of negotiating with Japan should fundamentally acknowledge the five basic principles proposed by former Foreign Minister Shidehara, fundamentally acknowledge the Twenty-One Demands forced upon us in the fourth year of the Republic, and envision a future where the two major nations of the Far East can coexist and prosper. However, looking at the current situation, can such a submissive diplomatic policy truly awaken the Japanese? Can it satisfy the Japanese? Can it retrieve so much as one inch of territory? "Unless Manchuria and Mongolia move to the Atlantic Ocean, unless Manchuria cannot coexist with Japan in this world, even a god rising up to take it would be impossible." Before occupying the Northeast, the Japanese had already made such a firm resolution. So, after occupying the Northeast, would they be willing to spit out this piece of fatty meat? If the Japanese still had the slightest intention of negotiating the return of the Northeast, why did the Japanese resolutely refuse Gu Weijun's visit to Japan with the investigation team? This shows that they absolutely do not want to mention the Northeast issue again and do not want to change the established situation in the Northeast. In other words, they do not want to spit out this piece of fatty meat. This is abundantly clear. Even if our country humbles itself to negotiate, what can we do if the Japanese ignore us?</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if we accept Shidehara's five basic principles, acknowledge the Twenty-One Demands, and acknowledge all the illegitimate rights and interests of the Japanese in the Northeast, can we retrieve the Northeast from the hands of the Japanese? As required in the Twenty-One Demands, can the sovereignty of the Northeast's territory and administration still be considered "intact?" Can these two major nations of the Far East truly be said to "coexist and prosper?" The Japanese will certainly "exist" and "prosper" according to their ambitions. But can China coexist? Can it prosper together? If, as some argue, most of the Twenty-One Demands have already been realized in fact, then why bother arguing about the name and not acknowledge them? We can also say that since the Japanese have already occupied it in fact, why bother arguing about the name and not formally offer it up with both hands? The signing of the Twenty-One Demands was forced upon us by military force. The fact that most of them have already been realized is also due to military force. It is like a robbery. A robbery is still a robbery. But no one who has been robbed would ever admit that the robbery was legitimate, and no one would ever admit that the stolen property should belong to the thief. Being robbed is due to violence, but acknowledging the legitimacy of the robbery would create an ironclad case. In the international arena, we would have no room for argument. For the sake of national integrity and national survival, even if the Northeast could truly be recovered in this way, we must insist that the Twenty-One Demands cannot be acknowledged. The national spirit of a country cannot be entirely sold off.</p>
<p>So, what should the policy of negotiating with Japan be? The answer is that under the current circumstances, there is no negotiation possible with Japan, and no policy can be determined. We can only exhaust our national strength to resist aggression and recover lost territory. The League of Nations cannot be relied upon, and foreign aid cannot be counted on. Today's affairs can only be helped by our own strength, which is the only way to survive and save ourselves. This is abundantly clear. There is no other way or strategy. Fighting to the death for survival is the only way to live. If we steal life through humiliation, we will never live, and we will leave an indelible shame in history. This is what we should truly recognize.</p>

<h3>The Puppet State's Seizure of Customs Duties, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Note to Japan Has Been Delivered to the Japanese Consulate in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' serious protest to Japan regarding the puppet state's seizure of customs duties at the instigation of the Japanese government was personally delivered by officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Japanese Consulate in Beijing for forwarding. The Japanese Embassy telegraphed the Tokyo government, stating that the note had been received by the Deputy Consul in Beijing, Shimada. It is reported that the content of the protest, in addition to stating that the traitorous puppet organization was entirely organized by Japan, has no legal basis, and the Chinese government has repeatedly declared its denial to the outside world, so all its illegal actions cannot be recognized and should be the responsibility of Japan. A separate statement was also made regarding the robbery of the Dalian Customs. Because Dalian is a Japanese leased territory, according to the Sino-Japanese treaty for the lease of Dalian signed on May 3, 1907, Japan should be legally and factually responsible for the robbery of the Dalian Customs. The Chinese government makes a solemn statement on this point. Chinese customs duties are collateral for Chinese and foreign debt. Today's government ignores treaty obligations and arbitrarily destroys the integrity of Chinese customs administration. The major responsibility arising from this should be borne entirely by the Japanese government, and the right to claim compensation for all losses incurred by force is reserved. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Puppet Government Will Establish New Customs</h3>
<p>(Dalian) The Manchu government sent a note to the Kwantung Government on the 23rd, stating that the Manchu government is dispatching Manchukuo customs officials to Dalian and earnestly hopes for the Kwantung Government's consent. If consent is not given, it will send customs officials to reside in Wafangdian and hopes there will be no opposition. The Kwantung Government is currently consulting with the South Manchuria Railway Company on this matter. (26th News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Japanese government believes that if it opposes the Manchu government's receipt of the Dalian Customs' note, it will set up a new customs in Wafangdian. Japan's opinion is: (1) Taxing in both Dalian and Wafangdian will be double taxation. (2) Because of the double tariffs, merchants' goods will not pass through Dalian but will be imported through Andong and Yingkou, which will be a major blow to the South Manchuria Railway and Dalian will inevitably decline. Therefore, the Japanese government and all related parties are paying close attention to it. (26th News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The Japanese delegation has requested instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which sent the following instructions yesterday:</p>
<p>(1) Japan has reserved its position on the opening of a League of Nations General Assembly to apply Article 15 of the Charter to the Sino-Japanese incident. Even at the special assembly acknowledging the delay of the Lytton Report, the Japanese government will still have no relationship with it. However, Japan has no obstacles to Simon's request, so the opening of the General Assembly is entirely free. However, it is regrettable that the Japanese representative cannot participate in the consultation. Also, Simon's notice does not seem to involve the Manchurian issue. (26th News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany Initiates European Economic Union, Expanding Danube River Plan</h3>
<p>French and German Prime Ministers Discussed in Lausanne</p>
<p>British Prime Minister MacDonald Expresses Approval</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, Lausanne, 25th – The grand plan for a European alliance, recently initiated here by the German representative Brüning, will be the focus of world attention in the middle of next week. It is reported that French Prime Minister Herriot and German Chancellor Brüning discussed this matter during their meeting yesterday. It is also reported that British Prime Minister MacDonald approves of it. The Italian delegation to the reparations conference today advocated the complete abolition of war debts and reparations.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, Paris, 25th – Herriot's arrival here from Lausanne has generated optimistic public opinion. It is said that the French and German Prime Ministers discussed not only the issue of reparations, but also the entire issue of European economic recovery, such as currency, commerce, and tariffs. This approach is now felt to have opened up great possibilities, as it is said that British Prime Minister MacDonald approves of this broad development, and German representative Brüning has also suggested extending the Danube River plan to all European powers. It is generally felt that this plan should not be difficult to establish, so that France can ultimately obtain full compensation for its abandonment of reparations. After consulting with the cabinet today, Herriot spoke in an optimistic tone about the negotiations in Lausanne and Geneva, saying that the talks are gradually yielding results, but he has not yet made a positive statement on President Hoover's disarmament proposal.</p>
<h3>Franco-German Negotiations to Resume Today</h3>
<p>Kokumin News dispatch, Lausanne, 25th – Herriot and Brüning are each engaged in negotiations in their respective capitals, so there has been no development in today's reparations conference. Financial experts from the German and French negotiations are now preparing everything for the resumption of direct negotiations on Monday.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch, Berlin, 26th – Chancellor Brüning departed from Berlin for Lausanne at 4:00 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Kokumin News dispatch, Berlin, 25th – The Paris Morning Post carries an interview with German Chancellor Brüning by a Lausanne reporter, saying that Brüning has acknowledged France's fundamental right to demand compensation for agreeing to cancel political debts. Today, Brüning denied this to representatives of the Ocean Society, saying that the Morning Post's report was completely false. In his first speech at the Lausanne Conference, he advocated that the conference should not involve the legal points of the reparations dispute. However, when discussing the difficulties of the situation, this was his advocated theory, how could he acknowledge any legal demands from France? He repeatedly stated to representatives of the French press that German-French cooperation is the most important condition for the world's economic recovery. The benefits that France obtains from this cooperation are actually greater than continuing to pay reparations. Moreover, France now knows that Germany's inability to pay is not Germany's fault, but the natural result of stopping the withdrawal of capital reserve funds and the high tariff barriers erected by various countries. Today, if one wants to restore the world's economic balance, it is definitely not something that can be achieved through a passive plan like clearing up political debts. It is necessary to quickly implement an active plan like canceling reparations. Germany intends to do its best to make this plan a reality. He believes that if European countries can proceed in this way, it will definitely evoke a good impression from the United States. Although Germany and France have great differences of opinion on political debts, it is still hoped that a solution can be found for joint action by European countries.</p>
<h3>Reform of Siamese Political System</h3>
<p>Establishment of a Constitutional Monarchy</p>
<p>Former King Still Held as Head of State</p>
<p>Autocratic and Tyrannical Government Sparks Revolution</p>
<p>Relatives and Favorites Detained and Not Released</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, Bangkok, 25th – The Siamese revolution seems to have been completely successful. The King of Siam has telegraphed from the seaside palace to Bangkok, stating that he has long known the need for a change of government and is now willing to be the head of the new government. Leaders of the People's Party object to using the term "revolution" for this change of government, saying that they are only establishing a government organized by the people and taking measures for the people with the King's consent.</p>
<p>Kokumin News dispatch, Bangkok, 26th – After the sudden outbreak of the organized revolution in Siam, it is now possible to learn the general situation from various sources. It is reported that the Siamese army and navy, under the leadership of senior officers, suddenly rose up before dawn, occupied various agencies in the capital, and sent troops to surround the royal family one by one. Prince Svagga, the Minister of the Interior and Regent remaining in the capital, was lifted from his bed in the palace and escorted to the main hall, heavily guarded. The national police chief was also dealt with in the same way. When the King of Siam and the Queen were away from the capital, vacationing on the Hua Hin Peninsula (transliteration), a cruiser was dispatched to monitor them urgently. Therefore, there were rumors at the time that members of the royal family had taken refuge on warships. Prior to the uprising, telephone lines to all important locations were cut off. After the uprising, troops patrolled the streets in cars, constantly coming and going, and the people greeted them with cheers. According to what was heard today, only Commerce and Communications Minister Prince Biyara escaped and was not found by the revolutionary army. This revolution was led by the chiefs of staff of the army and navy, who directed everything. The revolutionary party has issued a declaration stating that the King's autocracy is tyrannical, and that those around him are foolish and greedy. If the King of Siam does not agree to the establishment of a constitutional government, it will be changed to a republic. It also stated that the King of Siam likes to use relatives and favorites, causing the court to become increasingly chaotic. According to the latest news, the King of Siam has agreed to the demands for a constitution, but the royal family is being held hostage, and martial law has been declared throughout the country.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch, Paris, 25th – The Paris "L'Intransigeant" writes about the Siamese revolution, saying: "Among Asian countries, Siam is the one that values class the most and changes the least. Unexpectedly, it has now also entered the revolutionary trend. The main cause of the revolution is economic. In recent times, financial difficulties have forced the government to vigorously reduce staff and salaries, with a temporary layoff of 1,000 officials and 450 military officers. The trade in rice and timber has also been sluggish recently, making people unable to make a living, and the number of crimes is increasing day by day. Silver prices have fallen, and the budget has been reduced from 19 million ticals (Siamese currency) to 14 million. These are economic phenomena. From the government's point of view, power in Siam is in the hands of various princes. In recent years, the princes have imitated European styles, seeking too much too quickly. The King is the backer of the princes, but because he conforms to the times, his attitude is close to that of the head of a European parliamentary state, and not like that of a monarch of an Asian country. Therefore, the people of Siam say that the King is no longer blessed by the Emperor of Heaven because his actions are no longer like those of a Son of Heaven. Siamese newspapers even have suggestions for regicide. Since the Chinese revolution, it has been said that Asian kingdoms that are at peace within their borders will henceforth be infected by revolution. Now it has come to pass. The initiators of the Siamese revolution are the military, and those who prepared beforehand were various nationalist and conservative groups secretly organized by military officers.

<h3>German Brownshirts Causing Trouble Everywhere</h3>
<p>Destroying Socialist Newspaper Offices</p>
<p>Clashing Violently with Workers</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch, Berlin, 25th – Since the National Socialists resumed wearing uniforms, conflicts have frequently broken out throughout Germany, especially in the Rhineland, almost like a civil war. However, the Communists are now gradually changing their policy, not attacking uniformed National Socialists, but waiting for them to leave the group alone, then surrounding them and stripping them of their uniforms, leaving only their shirts and shorts, and letting them go. The Socialists have never joined the conflicts, but today National Socialists beat newsboys selling Socialist newspapers, leading to a conflict with the Socialists. Both sides fought each other, and someone opened fire, injuring several people.</p>
<p>Kokumin News dispatch, Berlin, 25th – Today, 50 uniformed National Socialists stormed the Socialist publishing house on Linden Street, smashing the typesetting room, apparently trying to prevent the publication of the Socialist central organ newspaper Vorwärts. They clashed violently with workers, throwing heavy objects such as lead blocks and lead bars at each other. Two typesetting workers were seriously injured. The National Socialists were ultimately outnumbered and retreated to the street. The public also joined the workers to continue the fight. The National Socialists made a final struggle, but eventually retreated in disarray, leaving one seriously injured person behind. This person and two typesetting workers were injured by pistol bullets, indicating that both sides had fired at each other.</p>

<h3>Treasure Found at the Bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, Worth 180,000 Pounds Sterling</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch, London, 26th – The mail ship Egypt sank off the coast of Ushant in 1922 after colliding with another ship. The ship was loaded with a large amount of gold and silver. The Italian salvage ship Artiglio has been engaged in salvage operations. Initially, a package containing banknotes worth 15,000 rubles was obtained. Last year, the safe containing secret documents belonging to the captain of the survey ship was salvaged. After a year of work, the location of the treasure was finally found. The Artiglio arrived in Plymouth today carrying gold and silver worth 180,000 pounds sterling and was immediately detained by the authorities on the orders of the Admiralty. The cargo hold was also sealed because David, the former captain of the salvage ship Eloise, claimed that he was the first to find the location of the sunken ship and should therefore share in the salvaged gold and silver. Therefore, the authorities took this action.</p>

<h3>Manchurian Japanese Army Suffers Losses</h3>
<p>Tonghua Besieged by Red Spear Society</p>
<p>Defeat at Keshan at the Hands of Ma's Army</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Changchun Dispatch: Japanese gun emplacements near Dunhua have recently been surrounded by the Red Spear Society. Our soldiers guarding the gun emplacements have suffered heavy casualties from their fierce attacks. It is also reported that the Big Sword Society and anti-Japanese volunteer armies in Tonghua are extremely powerful. Tonghua has completely fallen, and the consular branch has also been destroyed. Anti-Japanese sentiment in the area has reached an extreme. There is considerable concern about the safety of Japanese lives. It is further reported that Colonel Hamamoto of the Tamon Unit, who was in charge of the garrison in Qiqihar, made the following remarks to reporters in Moji upon his return to the capital: "Since the Great Hinggan War, our unit has suffered many casualties. The Red Spear Society raises its flags and chants spells to boost morale, claiming that Japanese bullets cannot hit them, and even if they do, they will not be fatal. The necks of the Red Spear Society's spears are tied with red cloth. Their soldiers, believing in the magic of the Red Spear Society, advance bravely, regardless of life or death. Therefore, in the battle of Hulan, they charged fiercely at our army, disregarding their lives."</p>
<p>The Kokumin Shimbun reports that in the Keton area northwest of Hailun on the Hulan-Hai Lun line, Ma Zhanshan's army engaged in a fierce battle with our Tanaka Detachment, resulting in many casualties on our side. At the same time, our army also suffered heavy losses in the Keshan area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Secretly Sell Fortress Maps</h3>
<p>Disclosure of Japanese Soldiers' Treasonous Acts: Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun reports that the Chiba Prefectural Police in Kamogawa, Chiba Prefecture, discovered that Itō Harukichi, a retired artillery sergeant residing in Yokosuka, Kamogawa Town, Awa District, secretly sold two maps of the Bōsō Peninsula fortress (1:50,000 scale) from the Army General Staff Headquarters to a certain country. On the evening of the 17th, they dispatched a team, together with Sergeant Hirao of the Tateyama Military Police Sub-station, to arrest Itō Harukichi and search his residence. It is reported that several other people are also implicated in this matter, and are currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Major Communist Case Discovered by the Ningxiang County Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>More Than a Dozen Key Party and Government Figures Arrested: Changsha Dispatch reports that the Ningxiang County Party Headquarters, on June 16th, convened a meeting of party, government, military, and public organization personnel to commemorate Sun Yat-sen's martyrdom in Guangzhou. Suddenly, Zhu Dingsan, the head of the Ningxiang Security Brigade, dispatched over a hundred soldiers to surround the county party headquarters. On the spot, they arrested Xiao Xuetai, Xia Yuanbin, Yu Shuyan, Wen Ximo, Yu Kexiang (Director of the Education Bureau), Yu Zhongheng (Member of the Finance Committee), Yu Shilong (Director of the Production and Loan Management Office), Li Jilin, Li Tilian, Zhang Xikui, Liu Feifei (all staff members of the county party headquarters), Liao Ruochun (staff member of the county farmers' association), and Wang Lingxiao (manager of the Printing and Publishing Bureau), dispatching troops to the Printing and Publishing Bureau and arresting the bureau manager Wang Lingxiao. They announced a temporary curfew and launched a large-scale search and arrest of party headquarters and various local organization personnel, throwing the county into chaos. Personnel from various public organizations fled to the provincial capital to report the emergency, the situation being so serious as to resemble a riot by the Ningxiang Security Brigade. Upon receiving the report, the provincial party headquarters immediately dispatched Zhu Haohuai, Liu Yuehou, and Huang Xigong to inquire with the provincial government. Acting Chairman Cao Dianqiu stated that it was a search for communists and nothing else. However, the members of the provincial party headquarters believed that the case was a result of a conflict between old and new factions in the county. Even if some individuals were suspected of being communists, the matter should be referred to the higher-level party headquarters for handling, and it was inappropriate to make arrests without authorization. Moreover, Zhu Dingsan's dispatching of troops to arrest party members and destroy the party headquarters, as well as the destruction of the party-run Minbao newspaper and the Printing and Publishing Bureau, was deemed inappropriate. Therefore, they initially demanded that the provincial government remove Cao Mingzhen, the commander of the anti-bandit forces in Ningxiang, Xiangxiang, Yiyang, and Anhua counties, and Zhu Dingsan, the head of the Ningxiang County Security Brigade, and that all arrested personnel be brought to the province for interrogation, without any on-the-spot executions. Later, the provincial government dispatched Li Qiong, the head of the enforcement department of the anti-bandit headquarters, to Ningxiang. Besides executing Wang Bangheng, Yang Baosheng, Yang Shousheng, Wan Jinghai, and Chen Shulin, five individuals who continued to work for the communists after surrendering (Wang et al. held positions as principals and teachers in primary schools), all others with lighter suspicions, such as Wen Ximo, were released on bail. As for Xiao Xuetai, Xia Yuanbin, Wang Lingxiao, Li Jilin, Yu Kexiang, and Yu Shuyan, they were escorted to the province on the evening of the 19th, in accordance with the provincial government's orders. However, the provincial party headquarters demanded that members of the provincial party headquarters be involved in the joint trial, and designated Huang Jiasheng, Zhu Haohuai, Peng Guojun, and Meng Qingxuan as members of the joint trial committee. They also telegraphed He Jian to return to Hunan as soon as possible to handle the case, and requested the Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters to send personnel to Hunan for a thorough investigation. At the same time, they informed the anti-bandit headquarters not to use torture without authorization before the case had been jointly tried by the party headquarters, as the provincial party headquarters suspected that there were other reasons behind this case. All sectors of Changsha society are paying close attention to this case. After returning to the province from Ningxiang with the case file, Li Qiong, the head of the enforcement department of the anti-bandit headquarters, fearing that various parties might misunderstand the truth and give rise to misinterpretations, publicly explained the origins of the case to various circles on the 22nd, stating that the incident stemmed from the anti-bandit headquarters in Xiangtan capturing Mei Chongdong, the head of the Xiangzhong Red Bandit pseudo-guerrilla force, earlier this month. Mei, a native of Ningxiang, knew the communist activities in Ningxiang well. According to his confession, there were over 700 communists who had surrendered in Ningxiang, including over 200 who were acting as teachers. Among them, many were still secretly working for the communists after surrendering. He was willing to lead troops to capture them in order to atone for his crimes. The anti-bandit headquarters granted his request for surrender and sent special agents Liu Shaoshu et al. to escort Mei Chongdong to Tongwen Town in Ningxiang on the 13th, where they uncovered the communist pseudo-county committee organization and captured the pseudo-county committee Xiao Meiyu and his accomplices, seizing seven rifles and over 600 rounds of ammunition hidden in the walls of the Youzhayuan School. On the 15th, Xiao Meiyu was brought to Ningxiang County and interrogated by Brigade Commander Zhu Dingsan. According to his confession, County Party Committee member Xiao Xuetai and others, as well as Huang Xigong, an alternate member of the provincial party committee, were all communists. Xiao Xuetai and others were responsible for work and communication within the county, while Huang Xigong was responsible for communication with the provincial authorities, preparing to redden various counties in central Hunan and seize the opportunity to riot. Therefore, Zhu Dingsan implemented emergency measures on the morning of the 16th and surrounded and arrested Xiao Xuetai et al. It was deeply shocking that Huang Xigong, an alternate member of the provincial executive committee, was also implicated. The anti-bandit headquarters has sent a letter to the provincial party headquarters asking them to monitor Huang Xigong pending interrogation. This is a major case of communists infiltrating the party after the May 21st Incident, plotting rebellion in secret, and is of great importance. It will be interrogated again after Commander He Jian returns to Hunan. Many parties have requested bail for the prisoners currently detained in the province, but all requests have been rejected. From Li Qiong's remarks, we can see the seriousness of this case. At the same time, He Jian, the commander of the Hunan anti-bandit forces, has sent a written report to the provincial party headquarters regarding the handling of this case. An excerpt is attached below: "With utmost respect, I am writing to report that Yan Ruoqiao, Xu Shangda, Zhong Jie, and other key leaders of the Red Bandits in Ningxiang have organized a pseudo-guerrilla force in central Hunan, wielding guns and causing chaos. Nearby counties have suffered greatly. If they are not eliminated in a timely manner, their influence will grow, posing a significant threat to the security of central Hunan. In order to concentrate our forces and launch a decisive campaign, our department reorganized the county security brigade and established an anti-bandit command in Ningxiang, Yiyang, Xiangxiang, and Anhua, to facilitate operations and strictly suppress the bandits. Coincidentally, two cases involving the pseudo-city committee Wang Wu and the pseudo-military committee Mei Chongdong were cracked in Changsha and Xiangtan, respectively. After interrogation, it was found that both cases were organized by the pseudo-central government sent to Hunan and were related to the pseudo-guerrilla force. Except for Wang Wu, who remained unrepentant and was dealt with according to the law, Mei Chongdong, the head of the pseudo-guerrilla force, confessed that he was from Ningxiang and knew a lot about the Red Bandit organization there, and that he had the possibility of turning against the communists. Special agents Liu Shaoshu et al. were ordered to escort him to the county to search for bandit weapons and capture the remaining bandits, and the county government and security brigade were ordered to assist at any time. Subsequently, Liu Shaoshu et al. returned to the department on the morning of June 16 and reported that they had cracked the county Red Bandit pseudo-county committee organ and captured the pseudo-county committee Xiao Meiyu and many of his accomplices, seizing seven rifles and 699 rounds of ammunition hidden in the walls of the Youzhayuan School in Tongwen Town. It was also confessed that there were many remaining bandits, and that they were closely related to the party and government organs, requesting that the matter be investigated. Due to the seriousness of the case, this department dispatched Li Qiong, the head of the enforcement department, and enforcement officials Tan Ruizhang and Xiang Zong to investigate and handle the case. Subsequently, Cao Mingzhen, the commander of the anti-bandit forces in Yiyang, Ningxiang, Xiangxiang, and Anhua, Zhao Hong, the county magistrate of Ningxiang, and Zhu Dingsan, the head of the Ningxiang County Security Brigade, reported urgently at 12:00 noon on June 16, stating: (1) On the 13th of this month, your department escorted the communist bandit Mei Chongdong and captured Xiao Meiyu, a member of the county pseudo-county committee in Gaolu Township, Ningxiang. On the 15th, he was brought to the Ningxiang Security Brigade and interrogated. He confessed that he had been classmates with Su Xuetai for fifteen or sixteen years, and that he had taught at his house. At that time, Su was the head of the district farmers' association. In February of this year, when Su Xuetai's grandmother died, Xia Dachang came to his house to offer condolences. Su said to Xue, 'I will investigate the county's news for you. The county's education sector and party headquarters are all united. Huang Xigong is responsible for investigating the provincial government's news. If there is any news, you can report it to them temporarily.' (2) It has been found that Xiao Xuetai, the current standing committee member of the county party headquarters, was originally the son of Xiao Shushi, the leader of the district farmers' association before the May 21st Incident, and also studied communist subjects at the pseudo-Agricultural Movement Training Institute in Wuchang. (3) It has also been found that Yu Kexiang, the current director of the Ningxiang Education Bureau, and Yu Shilong, the manager of the bureau's production loan, as well as Wen Ximo, Xia Yuanbin, Yu Shuyan, and Yu Zhongheng, all members of the county party headquarters, were all important figures who held prominent positions before the May 21st Incident. (4) Recently, Xiao Xuetai and others have issued a large number of reactionary publications, fabricating facts and wantonly defaming others, shielding bandits and communists. (5) Based on Xiao Meiyu's confession, we fear that the criminals will escape, and we arrested Xiao Xuetai, Xia Yuanbin, Yu Shuyan, Yu Zhongheng, Yu Kexiang, Yu Shilong, and Wen Ximo at 10:00 AM today and are currently interrogating them. (6) Huang Xigong has infiltrated himself as an alternate member of the provincial party committee and dares to still be a communist. We urgently request that he be arrested to prevent him from escaping, etc. Based on this, and after on-the-spot investigation by this department, the crimes of the five criminals Wang Bangting, Yang Baosheng, Yang Shousheng, Xiao Jinghai, and Chen Shulin were confirmed, and they were not involved in party and government affairs. They were dealt with according to the law on the spot. The suspects Wen Ximo, Liao Ruochun, and Liu Feifei had lighter suspicions and were allowed to be released on bail pending interrogation. As for Xiao Xuetai, he infiltrated our party and engaged in secret activities, which is a serious offense. Yu Kexiang, Xia Yuanbin, Wang Lingxiao, Li Jilin, and Yu Shuyan, as officials of party and government organs, colluded with each other, causing banditry in the county. They are also suspected of various crimes. They have been ordered to be brought to the department for separate investigation. The details of the case investigation and the seized evidence will be reported in a separate letter. As for Huang Xigong, we have received your valuable letter and have been monitoring him, and will request his interrogation in a separate letter. Correspondingly, the progress of the handling of the case is reported to your committee for your review. Sincerely, to the Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party of Hunan Province."

<h3>Zhu, Mao, and Peng's Factions Gather on the East Bank of the Gan River</h3>
<p>Each Returns to Jiangxi from the Fujian-Hunan Border</p>
<p>Bandit Forces Reunite After Division</p>
<p>Intending to Resist the Encirclement and Suppression by Various Armies</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch reports that the Red Bandits in the Southeast are divided into five pseudo-military groups. Except for the Second Military Group, which is on the border of Hubei and Sichuan, the rest are in Jiangxi. The Red Bandits in Jiangxi Province were previously besieged by the Guangdong armies of Li Zhenqiu, Ye Zhao, Zhang Meixin, and Fan Dexing's brigade, and were divided into three major groups to flee. The pseudo-First and Second Military Groups of Zhu De and Ji Zhendong entered Fujian. The pseudo-Third and Fourth Military Groups fled from the Jiangxi-Guangdong border to Hunan. Mao Zedong led the bandits from Ruijin, Xingguo, Ningdu, Yudu, and various parts of southern Jiangxi to remain in their old nests along the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian border for support. However, since the withdrawal of the Guangdong army, the entry of the 19th Route Army into Fujian, and the recovery of Guidong and Rucheng by the Hunan army, the bandit situation has changed unpredictably. The original Zhu De unit in western Fujian, with the pseudo-Fourth Army of Lin Biao, the pseudo-Eighth Army of Xiang Ying, the pseudo-Ninth Army of Wu Zhonghao, the pseudo-Twelfth Army of Luo Binghui, and the pseudo-Fifth Military Group of Zhao Bosheng (i.e., Ji Zhendong's unit), totaling about 60,000 to 70,000 people with 30,000 to 40,000 rifles, is stationed along the Jiangxi-Fujian border in Tingzhou, Liancheng, Jianning, Ninghua, and Longyan, echoing Mao Zedong's bandits in Ruijin and other counties in southeastern Jiangxi. They have adopted a confrontational posture towards the divisions of Wu Ping, Shanghang, Shanghuang, Zhiwen, and Zhang Ruigui, as well as the divisions of Shen Guanghan, Mao Weishou, Qu Shounian, and Zhang Zhen in southern Fujian. They have also built fortifications on the high ground south of Tingzhou and Longyan, from Huilongtang and Changqiao in the west to Jiaoling in the east, relying on the mountains to defend against danger, in order to consolidate their positions. However, after the Guangdong armies of Zhang and Huang captured Wuping and Shanghang, they launched an attack on Changting from Yongping on the 6th, encountering the main force of the pseudo-Fourth Army in Huilong, resulting in a fierce battle throughout the day, killing over 1,000 bandits. It is said that the commander of the pseudo-Fourth Army, Lin Biao, had both arms blown off by artillery shells. The intensity of the battle can be imagined. Zhu De, seeing the defeat in this area, feared that the Guangdong army would enter Tingzhou and cut off his connection between Jiangxi and Fujian, and that Longyan was not conducive to defense. Once the 19th Route Army reached Longyan, they would inevitably be attacked on three sides. Therefore, he decided to shorten the defense line and retreat his main force into Jiangxi in three routes: one from Gucheng in Tingzhou to Ruijin, one from Ninghua via Shuinan to Guangchang, and one from Jianning via Qianshan and Ganzhu back to Huangpi and Xiaopu in Ningdu. Only a small number of bandits armed with guns were left in the Tingzhou and Longyan areas for cover. After Zhu De's bandits returned to Jiangxi, they joined forces with Mao Zedong. The units of Peng Dehuai and Li Mingrui in the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Hunan border also retreated because they had recently disturbed Hunan and were severely suppressed by the divisions of Wang Dongyuan and Chen Guangzhong in Shangbao and Exing. The old nests along the Jiangxi-Guangdong border, such as Yingqian, Dafen, Wenying, and Nedu, were also destroyed by the Guangdong army one after another. Therefore, they resumed their old tricks of attacking in the east and striking in the west, and fleeing around to harass. A portion of the bandits harassed northwest towards Chaling, Youxian, Yongxin, Ninggang, and Jinggangshan to contain the Jiangxi and Hunan armies. The main forces of the pseudo-Fifth and Seventh Armies returned to their original route from Chongyi, Shangyou, Suichuan, Nankang, and Ganxian, and sneaked into Yudu and Xingguo, reuniting with Zhu and Mao after being divided. As for Zhu and Mao, it seems that a comprehensive suppression plan was decided at the Lushan Conference. Therefore, they have now completely concentrated their main forces in the dangerous mountainous areas of southeastern Jiangxi, which they call the Red Zone, adopting a scorched-earth policy and waiting for work in comfort. Their pseudo-central government is located in Ruijin, and they have built an airfield. The two aircraft captured in Zhangzhou were placed there. (According to a message from Ganzhou yesterday, the bandits' aircraft crashed at the Dongshengshe Dam across the river from Huichang at the beginning of this month.) The famous old nests that had been recovered by the National Army, such as Liren in Yudu, Gaoxingxu, Liantang, and Chenggang in Xingguo, Luokou, Dongshao, Huangpi, and Xiaopu in Ningdu, Baishui in Guangchang, Zhaoxie in Le'an, Tengtian, Shaxi, Longgang, and Toubei in Yongfeng, Shugu on the border of Ji'an, Yongfeng, and Xingguo, and Jiubao and Qiuxi in Ruijin and Shicheng, are now still occupied by the bandits. In other words, all the Red Bandits have gathered in their old nests on the east bank of the Gan River. Therefore, in the counties of southeastern Jiangxi, except for a few counties where only the urban areas have survived, the rest have almost completely returned to the state before Chairman Chiang visited Nanchang last year. However, the bandit forces are not as menacing as before, and the atmosphere is not as tense as before. (June 24th)</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River's Water Level Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Zhang Gong Dyke Still Not Completed: Hankou Dispatch reports that with continuous rainfall during the plum rain season, the river water has risen sharply. On the 25th, it rose by one foot and three inches overnight, with the Jianghan Customs water mark reaching 36 feet 9 inches, almost the same as the 38 feet 8 inches water level on the same day last year. The water heads of Sichuan and Hunan are still continuing to flow eastward, and the rain has not stopped at all. The impending danger is alarming. It has been found that during last year's flood, Wuhan was turned into a waterlogged country, and the sacrifices of the people's lives and the loss of property were incalculable. The authorities learned from the past and planned for future flood prevention, carefully planning and paying special attention to the dike repair budget. However, progress is slow, and there are no results. The Zhang Gong Dyke, which is a guarantee for the lives of millions of citizens in Hankou, has not yet been completed, and many of the riverside flood control dikes have not been repaired. The authorities are numb and indifferent. It is feared that last year's tragedy will inevitably be repeated today. Xia Douyin, chairman of the provincial government, considered the Zhang Gong Dyke to be important and specially dispatched inspector Huang Gejun to inspect it three times. According to the report yesterday, the project is not being carried out practically, and disaster victims waiting for work are being delayed. The original report stated, "Earthwork sections one and four of the dike began construction at the end of May. At the beginning of construction, there were only a few hundred workers. Since June 3rd and 4th, the number has gradually increased. Section one has been increased to over 900 workers, and section four has been increased to over 1,200 workers. Sections two and three began construction around June 3rd and 4th. Section two currently has over 500 workers, and section three has over 800 to 900 workers, with over 150 small boats. In total, there are currently only over 3,000 workers on the entire dike. On June 23rd, over 3,000 disaster victims were suddenly discovered on the dike. They were carrying hoes and baskets and claimed that the Flood Relief Association had sent a letter approved by your government, handing it over to the engineering section of the association for approval and employment, and ordered them to arrive at the dike on this day to await inspection. If all of them are added, it will only be the number of over 6,000 workers as stated in the association's reply to your government. However, the disaster victims stood on the dike, waiting until the 24th, but the Flood Relief Association delayed the inspection, and the section chiefs also refused to accept them. What are the disaster victims guilty of? They were ordered to go, and then they were delayed and rejected. The sound of crying and complaining of hunger and hardship after two days and nights of wind and rain is truly unbearable. Moreover, sections two and three of the dike are the largest, but the current number of people is the smallest. Even if the disaster victims are added on a certain date, it may not be possible to guarantee completion before the flood. Otherwise, it will inevitably be like the land-saving and soil-extraction projects in sections one and four, digging at the base and filling at the top, without reaching the estimated limit. As for the stone work, whether the repairs in the areas of Changfeng Yuan, Gusaoshu, Jintan, and Yintan are solid, the Water Conservancy Bureau is across the river from the Zhang Gong Dyke. It is the bureau chief's responsibility to know that the dike is related to the lives and property of millions of people in Hankou and should have been investigated thoroughly earlier. Why did he only send people to investigate in detail after being urged and still use dubious words to justify himself? Currently, the stone slope between Jintan and Shaijiashan has not been repaired, and the horizontal dike section is a large project. The number of stones transported is still not very large, and the loose pavement has not reached half of the dike body. The application of plaster is still in the planning stage, which is either the Water Conservancy Bureau's failure to pay attention or the dike project office's failure to take responsibility." After receiving the report, the provincial government ordered the Water Conservancy Bureau to increase manpower and rush to repair the dike on the 25th, and also sent a letter to the Flood Relief Association, dividing up the work and recruiting workers to start construction at the same time, in order to complete the repair as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As for the riverside flood control dike, Hankou originally decided to divide it up and rush to repair it. The section above Jianghan Customs and the two special districts one and two (former German and Russian concessions) were repaired by the Flood Relief Association, special district three (former British concession) was repaired by the district management bureau, the section below special district one to Chenjiaji was repaired by the Pinghan Railway Bureau, and the Japanese and French concessions were repaired by their respective authorities. However, the Japanese side repeatedly delayed this, preventing the entire dike from being completed as scheduled. The Hankou Municipal Government sent separate letters to the consuls on the 25th, requesting joint assistance in the project. In Wuchang, the Construction Department and the Water Conservancy Bureau are currently planning to repair the dike, and requested the provincial government to allocate funds on the 25th in order to start construction. As for the Wutai Gate New Dike project, after the previous dangerous situation, piling and stone throwing have been stepped up, and the dike body is relatively solid. In recent days, there have been no dangerous situations. (June 25th)</p>

<h3>Important Financial Resolutions in Anhui Province</h3>
<p>Resolution to Abolish the Special Business Tax</p>
<p>The Director of the Department of Finance Left Anhui in a Fit of Anger</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Anhui Province's finances were on the verge of collapse. The Provincial Government convened a financial committee in Anqing, inviting experts from the province, chairmen of chambers of commerce from various counties, and relevant parties. After more than ten days and six meetings, a resolution was passed to abolish the special business tax. However, He Qigong, the Director of the Department of Finance, left the province for Shanghai in a fit of anger. The committee has now adjourned, and the province has not released any information regarding the meeting's contents. Wu Xingzhou, the chairman of the provincial chambers of commerce, also attended the meeting and returned to Wuhu this morning with a record of the meeting. The key points are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for the Sudden Increase in Expenditures: Anhui Province has always been known for its poverty, and all government policies have been geared towards austerity. However, since Chen Tiaoyuan came to Anhui from Shandong, everything has been arranged according to the scale of a major province like Shandong, resulting in an annual increase of 3 million yuan in military expenses, 3.7 million yuan in government expenses, and 700,000 yuan in road construction expenses. Statistics show that expenditures have changed from over 9.5 million yuan to over 16.3 million yuan. Therefore, the budget adopts the method of determining expenditures based on income, resorting to excessive taxation and indiscriminate issuance of treasury bills, but the results are still insufficient to alleviate the province's financial difficulties, ultimately accumulating debts of over 4 million yuan. Now, in this time of deep water and scorching fire, the situation is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Abolishing the Special Tax to Save the People: When Chen Tiaoyuan was the chairman of the provincial government, he created the special business tax. Its harshness and detail were no different from restoring all of the Likin tax, and its malpractices were even worse. Inspection posts were set up everywhere on land and water, causing great distress to merchants and the people. The central government had already explicitly ordered its abolition. Moreover, the revenue from this Likin tax originally belonged to the central government's special funds and was not included in the provincial treasury's tax revenue. Chen Tiaoyuan, due to the sudden increase in extravagant expenditures, disregarded the people's sentiments and rashly imposed the tax. However, according to its tax amount, it only accounted for one-fifth of the province's total revenue. The Financial Committee resolved to request the provincial government to rectify all revenues and reduce expenditures appropriately, and to abolish this special business tax that harms the people and the government.</p>
<p>Rectifying Old Taxes to Increase Revenue: Since the return of land tax revenue to the provincial treasury in the 16th year of the Republic, the Department of Finance has not created and stored registers of actual receipts and debts owed by the people, resulting in no auditing in the past years. The Financial Committee resolved that in the future, the usual practice should still be followed, and a report should be created and submitted once every year to serve as the basis for the final accounts. Taxes on livestock slaughter, brokerage licenses, and other miscellaneous taxes, whether handled by the county government or contracted by merchants, are inevitably prone to corruption. It was resolved to establish people's auditing agencies, with each county's chamber of commerce establishing a miscellaneous tax supervision committee, which would have the power to audit the amount of livestock slaughter and brokerage license tax collected and remitted in the county. If there are any cases of concealment or tax evasion, the supervision committee can report them to the Department of Finance, and the regulations will be formulated by the Department of Finance. In addition, the annual quota for business tax is 1.17 million yuan. Since its implementation, only over 200,000 yuan has been collected. After deducting operating expenses, only over 90,000 yuan has reached the treasury. The cost of collection far exceeds the actual amount collected. The Financial Committee also resolved to request the Department of Finance to handle it jointly with miscellaneous taxes to save expenses and strengthen rectification.</p>
<p>Strictly Inspecting Grain Exports: Grain is the main product of the province. In years of good harvest, exports exceed 8 million piculs. In average years, it is about 6 million piculs, and in years of poor harvest, it is 4 million piculs. Other miscellaneous grains such as wheat, beans, and rapeseed are equal in total amount to rice. Military rice exports are not included. Calculated by tax rate, the annual revenue is between 3.2 million yuan and 6.78 million yuan. However, the current fixed quota is only 1.8 million yuan, which is still a huge difference from the lowest amount. Such uncheckedness not only results in the loss of tax revenue but also allows for private collection, endangering the people's food supply. The Financial Committee, in order to consider both aspects, resolved that regardless of military or commercial rice, the Department of Finance should directly issue shipping permits. Except for military rice, commercial rice will still be taxed at the current rate. Merchants must apply to the Department of Finance for a four-part shipping permit, with each permit stating a maximum of 100 piculs, so that merchants can ship in batches when they do not purchase the full amount. Regardless of whether they are Chinese merchants, after purchasing the grain, they must submit their passports to the nearest chamber of commerce for stamping, and the chamber of commerce will retain one copy for submission to the Department of Finance for verification. When the grain is transported to the inspection station, the passport will be submitted for inspection. If the goods match the documents after fair weighing and measurement, they will be released immediately. If the goods do not match the documents, the goods will be detained, and the Department of Finance will be requested to send personnel to inspect them together with the chamber of commerce. If the discrepancy is confirmed, they will be confiscated immediately. The minimum tax rate is estimated to be 3.2 million yuan, which is about 1.4 million yuan more than the current quota. The 1.4 million yuan increased revenue, excluding the 1.8 million yuan already allocated for construction, will be used to make up for various government expenses.</p>
<p>Eliminating Military Expenditures: Anhui Province has never had military expenditures. Since Chen Tiaoyuan led two brigades and two regiments that were not incorporated by the central government into Anhui in the 19th year of the Republic, they were called the Provincial Defense Army, with monthly salaries of over 180,000 yuan. Adding bandit suppression fees and various miscellaneous expenses, the total monthly expenditure is over 250,000 yuan. Temporary clothing is not included. Therefore, Anhui Province's expenditures suddenly increased by over 3 million yuan annually. The Financial Committee resolved to request the central government to pay this military expenditure and bandit suppression fee entirely from the national treasury to clarify the boundaries.</p>
<p>The above items are the most important matters of this meeting. Other matters, such as reducing expenditures to meet the standard of living within one's means and strictly pursuing old debts to make up for the provincial government's overdrafts, were all discussed thoroughly and resolved on record, so that the final accounts and budget have a basis. However, since Director He has already left Anhui, many twists and turns are inevitable. Wu Zhongxin, the chairman of the provincial government, has telegraphed He to return quickly, and has also expressed his determination to promote the implementation of the abolition of the special business tax.

<h3>Shandong Library Counts Liu Tang's Collection</h3>
<p>Over 1,000 titles and over 10,000 volumes, Jinan Correspondence: Liu Tang (Zi: Chunzhai) from Fugou, Henan Province, donated his large collection of books to the Shandong Provincial Library in his will. Currently, 20 large boxes of the collection have been seized by the Jinan District Court due to debt issues. The Provincial Library is pursuing legal action against the court based on Liu's will. The remaining 69 large boxes, which have not been seized, have been transported to the library. Ren Fangtong, a secretary dispatched by the provincial government, and Ma Rumei, a supervisor dispatched by the Department of Education, together with Wang Xianhan, the director of the Provincial Library, and Liu Shigu, the donor's representative, and Hao Ganzhen (representing Liu Shigu), Qu Yipeng, Zheng Yannong, Tao Hongxiang, etc. (representing the library), started counting the books on June 13th and finished on the 23rd. A total of 1,033 titles and 14,674 volumes of books were found in the 69 boxes, mostly collections. The best ones include: "Complete Works of Tianmu Xiansheng," Ming Wanli edition, 16 volumes; "Collected Works of Mr. Wang Zongshan," Ming Wanli Tang Zhenwu edition, 11 volumes; "Longhan Collection," Ming Shanglunzhai edition, 8 volumes; "Collected Works of Zhang Taiyue," Ming Wanli edition, 10 volumes, lacking the lower volume; "Complete Works of Duke Wang Wencheng," Ming Jiajing edition, 24 volumes; "Complete Works of Chen Baisha," Ming Wanli edition, 10 volumes; "Han Wen Kao Yi," Ming Wanli copied Song edition, 5 volumes; "Complete Works of Duke Wen Xinguo," Daoguang reprinted edition, 16 volumes; "Nan Geng Shu Chao," Ming Chongzhen edition, 2 volumes; "Yunhui Xiaobu," Ming Sizhiguan edition, 10 volumes; "Hongwu Zhengyun," Ming edition, 5 volumes; "Collected Works of Mr. Luo Ezhou," Ming Wenxianci copied Song edition, 2 volumes; "Erya Yi," 6 volumes; "Tonghua Old Copy," 1 volume; "Annals of An Lushan," Daoguang fourth year edition, 40 volumes; "Shi Su," Ming Wanli edition, 20 volumes, totaling 1,033 titles and 14,674 volumes. In the 33rd box, there are books written by Liu Tang himself, such as "Beishang Yin Cao," "Shuzha Jishi," "Hui Dong Songyan," "Zhou Jia Lu," "Huanyou Yin Cao," "Zhouhang Yin Cao," "Zai Zhen Riji," "Bijian Caotang Shiwen Ji," etc. Liu Shigu believed that they were his ancestors' manuscripts and took them back for collection, leaving one copy of each for the library as a memento, totaling 143 volumes taken back and 14,531 volumes remaining in the library. The donation was completely unconditional. However, the library believed that Liu Shigu was able to fulfill his ancestor's will by donating over 20,000 volumes of books worth 50,000 to 60,000 yuan (including the seized ones) to the library, making him the most enthusiastic public welfare advocate in Shandong. Therefore, it is planned to submit a request to the Department of Education to forward it to the Provincial Government and then to the National Government for an official commendation to recognize his good deeds. Liu Tang's coffin is currently in Jinan, and it is also planned to find a way to transport it back to his original hometown for burial. His books are currently being cataloged and sorted. Once the seized part is transported to the library, a separate room will be opened and the books will be placed completely inside. Because Liu's title was Shouyu, the room will be named</p>
<p>Shouyu Book Depository, and a part of Liu's personal belongings will be stored in the room as a memento. (25th)</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Shandong's Product Exports</h3>
<p>The reason is the impact of the loss of the Northeast</p>
<p>Jiaoji Railway Business Sees Great Depression</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jiaoji Railway's business has been sluggish for the past six months. It is said that the reason is not only the blockage of Zibo coal sales to Shanghai, but other freight has also declined simultaneously. In previous summers, the bulk of the Jiaoji Railway's freight was flour, bran, live cattle, and eggs. Now, flour is hit by American flour. Coastal ports such as Qingdao, Yantai, and Longkou are all within the scope of American flour. Jinan flour is not easily sold to the east. Bran is the raw material for making beer. In the past, the Japanese bought a lot, but now that the Japanese have occupied the Northeast, they have switched to buying it in the Northeast. The sale of live cattle has stagnated, partly because Qingdao has increased naval expenses, resulting in high taxes and low profits, and partly because refugees from this province who lived in the Northeast cannot bear the Japanese iron heel and have returned to their hometowns to farm. There are fewer sellers of cattle and more buyers, so cattle exports have also decreased. Eggs were also needed by the Japanese, but now the Japanese have switched to buying them in the Northeast, and Shandong eggs are rarely exported. With the above conditions, exports have decreased significantly, and imports have also decreased daily due to the boycott of Japanese goods. The Jiaoji Railway's business has plummeted, with daily revenue only around 20,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 10,000 yuan compared to last year, and a monthly decrease of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Local Correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Limited Time to Remove Grain and Give Prices for Farmland Used for Road Construction: At the county's fifth administrative meeting, Li Zuhua, the director of the Finance and Property Office, proposed that the Songwei and Songsidao county roads have been built for a long time, and the price for all farmland used for construction should be given and purchased as soon as possible, and the case of abolishing rent and taxes should be resolved. It was decided that the county government should order the Finance Bureau to expedite the abolition of rent and taxes this year and not delay any further. At the same time, the Construction Bureau was ordered to quickly announce the farmland used for construction, give prices for purchase, so as to avoid disputes between owners and tenants, and alleviate the people's hardship. The county government has now followed the resolution and ordered the Finance and Construction Bureaus to comply.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees of the County Chamber of Commerce: The County Chamber of Commerce held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members yesterday (the 25th). The meeting was chaired by Cai Yu and discussed the following matters: (1) The Songjiang branch of the China Xingye Bank was robbed in broad daylight, and the Public Security Bureau should be held responsible and strictly investigate the case. It was resolved that the chamber should send a telegram to the Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the High Court, strictly ordering the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau to solve the case within a limited time to stabilize the market. (2) The special business tax is harmful to merchants and the people and should be telegraphed for abolition. It was resolved that the chamber should send a telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, strictly ordering the Provincial Government and the Department of Finance to stop it, and send a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce to strive for relief from commercial hardship.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Methods for Money Shops to Extend Loans: The Wuxi Money Shop Association held its 63rd regular meeting at 3 PM yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Jiang Huanqing. The matters discussed: (1) In order to maintain the market and regulate finance, should the association find ways to deal with households that continue to operate or change their business license after not concluding or going bankrupt? It was resolved: (A) Any households that have not concluded transactions with Jia Zhuang, owe money after going bankrupt, delay repayment, or reduce the amount to be repaid, regardless of whether the shareholders or managers change their business license or partner with others, all shops under this association must not open accounts with them. If anyone uses a pseudonym or privately interacts with them, once discovered, the association will issue a warning immediately. If they still interact with them after the warning, Jia Zhuang can claim compensation from the shop that opened the account. (B) Starting from today, for all households of the same industry that went bankrupt and owe money from the previous year, the interacting shops should verify the names of the shareholders and managers of each household and report them to the association. After being approved by the regular meeting, the association will post the facts of the household's bankruptcy and the names of the shareholders and managers to the same industry for attention at any time. (C) Those who guarantee transactions but do not compensate for payment will be treated the same as the shareholders and managers of each household. (3) Various shops have accepted a large number of pawned old cocoons and old silk, which are now overdue for a long time and repayment is delayed. A request was made for the association to publish a notice in the newspaper to urge repayment within a limited time. It was resolved that July 15th of this year will be the deadline. If repayment is not made by the deadline, each shop that accepted the pawn can offset the debt by changing the market price to compensate, so as to facilitate turnover. If the amount is insufficient, the shop can still pursue the pawnor for compensation. The association will publish a notice in the Shen and Xi newspapers immediately. (3) The interest rate for June was discussed. It was resolved that the deposit interest rate is 2 mills and the loan interest rate is 4 mills.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Measures to Aid the Silk Industry: Lu Bichou, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and Zeng Yangfu, the Director of the Department of Construction, jointly proposed establishing a model area for silkworm improvement in order to fundamentally aid the silk industry. Nansha in Xiaoshan County and Nansha in Shaoxing County were designated as model areas for improved sericulture. Improved methods such as mulberry planting and silkworm rearing will be tested first. All old methods that are detrimental to the quality and yield of silkworms and mulberry trees must be strictly prohibited in this area. The county magistrates, the directors of the public security and construction bureaus, and the district chiefs were charged with implementing the measures earnestly. After success is achieved, gradual promotion will be considered in order to achieve universality. The Provisional Measures for the First Model Area for Silkworm Improvement in Zhejiang Province were drafted and submitted to the provincial government meeting for approval and were promulgated. The original text is extracted as follows: (1) The Nansha area of Xiaoshan County and the Nansha area of Shaoxing County are designated as the First Model Area for Silkworm Improvement. (2) The Department of Construction should investigate and select high-quality silkworm eggs and distribute them to households according to the amount of mulberry trees and the amount of spring and autumn eggs needed in the area. The price of the eggs will be determined by the Department of Construction. The Department will be responsible for all matters related to disinfection, warming, shared breeding, and household guidance, without additional charges. (3) In order to unify varieties, protect silkworm production, and improve cocoon quality, it is not allowed to buy, sell, or raise any other silkworm eggs within the area. The county magistrate, the director of the public security bureau, the director of the construction bureau, and the district chief will be responsible for prohibiting and strictly forbidding it. (4) The number of silkworms raised by silkworm farmers should be based on the amount of mulberry trees they own and the silkworm room as standards, and excessive raising is not allowed. (5) The cocoons produced in the area will be sold by merchants contracted by the Department of Construction according to the market price approved by the Department of Construction. (6) The number and location of existing cocoon shops in the area should be determined by the Department of Construction in conjunction with the Department of Finance according to the needs, and the shops will be ordered to open.</p>
<p>Important Points</p>
<h3>Preliminary Remarks on Saving Agriculture</h3>
<p>— Shen Weixian</p>
<p>In the recent decade, commerce in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been declining daily, and the industrial sector is also fraught with panic. The only people not shaken are the old farmers who till the land for food and draw water for drink. But today, the farmers sigh in the fields, and the women lament in their homes, presenting a precarious and overwhelmed picture. Some say this is due to increased land taxes and numerous levies, which landowners bear, while tenant farmers only indirectly suffer. Others attribute it to damage from floods and the ravages of pests, attributing it to natural disasters and temporary misfortune. Allow me to speak of the direct burdens that accumulate year after year, leading to ever-increasing hardship.</p>
<p>One is the high price of rice to buy and the low price of rice to sell for farmers. Grain grows from the farmer's efforts, seemingly belonging to them completely. However, farmers have long lacked storage. Only three or four out of a hundred households store last year's grain in the seventh or eighth month to tide them over until the new harvest. From tilling the fields, sowing seeds, weeding, fertilizing, to building threshing floors and harvesting grain, labor costs are high, and prices of goods are steep. It generally costs over a hundred taels of silver to cultivate ten mu of land. Upper-class farmers cannot avoid borrowing, those in the middle mortgage their possessions, and the lowest class eat "monthly rice." ("Monthly rice" means buying rice on credit from rice shops, paying interest monthly at a rate of at least two percent. Regardless of the duration, interest is calculated for ten months, amounting to no less than four percent.) By the time of the autumn harvest, debts have accumulated. Fortunately, in a bountiful year, the yield per mu may reach two shi. If rice prices are reasonable, after repaying debts and completing rent payments, there are still resources for the rest of the year. However, for the past three years, around the time when the old harvest is running out and the new one is not yet ready, rice prices have steadily risen. But when the autumn and winter harvest arrives, rice prices gradually decrease. When farmers have no rice, they borrow it at high prices, and when they have rice, they sell it at low prices. Often, two shi cannot offset one shi. Over the years, this cycle multiplies, diminishing the strength of cultivation, lowering the amount of harvest, and making the livelihood extremely bleak. Furthermore, the deadline for redeeming rice mortgaged during the winter is traditionally around Qingming Festival, fearing spoilage over time. This year, around Qingming Festival, military affairs were pressing, finances were stagnant, and borrowing was impossible. They had no choice but to plead with rice shops to redeem their rice at a cost. Originally, it was worth six yuan and some change, but the current market price is less than eight yuan. After offsetting the principal and interest, each shi only yields two rice bags. With this rice sold, the countryside loses some of its stored grain, and as the Mangzhong season approaches, rice prices surge again. If the autumn harvest fails, the disastrous situation is difficult to predict. This is the first area urgently needing relief.</p>
<p>Another is the consecutive years of poor cotton harvests, while cotton prices are also squeezed by foreign yarn. In the coastal areas of Jiading and Songjiang, many plant cotton. This field relies on female labor. In the past, labor costs were low, and cotton harvests were quite abundant. Each mu yielded over a hundred catties for those with good harvests, and one zu (seventy catties) for those with less. Moreover, the price was higher than that of rice. Cotton farmers often exchanged one zu of cotton for one shi of white rice (this I have personally experienced). Since foreign cotton and yarn have become popular in the mainland, with their fine threads and light texture suitable for weaving, domestic cotton is only used for weft threads and making quilts. Its price has been decreasing daily, while disasters such as wind, pests, waterlogging, hail, and prolonged rain occur every year. The yield per mu is often no more than one he (twenty-five catties), while labor and material prices are several times higher than before (after rains, it costs five or six jiao per day, including food and drink). Villagers lack the ability to hire labor, and weeding is incomplete, leading to overgrown weeds and barren cotton fields. With meager production yielding low returns, it is natural to lay down the hoe and sigh. Some say they should switch to planting rice, but this swampy land used to be saline soil converted to freshwater, suitable for cotton. Furthermore, the terrain is uneven, with many leaks in the middle. One waterwheel can only irrigate fifteen or sixteen mu, so they often rotate crops each year, planting two-thirds with cotton and one-third with rice. With the cotton harvest failing, and rice difficult to promote, the livelihood of coastal residents is even more difficult than those in the glutinous rice region. This is the second area urgently needing relief.</p>
<p>Another is the failure of cocoon merchants, the crisis in sericulture, and the impact on agricultural affairs. Silk from Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou is vital to the economy. Commerce has expanded because of it, and the people have become prosperous. This has been the case for a long time. However, in its heyday, silk and cocoon merchants amassed huge profits, while the gains for silkworm farmers were meager. With their failure, silk and cocoon factories have been closing one after another, and the panic among farmers has grown. Those who raise silkworms must first have several mu of mulberry trees. They estimate the amount of silkworms based on the yield. Annually, one dan of cocoons requires twelve or thirteen dan of leaves. Including the cost of mulberry groves, land rent, silkworm rearing labor, and food, it costs about twenty to thirty taels of silver to obtain a hundred catties of fresh cocoons. Those who buy leaves and raise silkworms spend even more. If they suffer from disease or spoilage, the losses are immeasurable. Every time the cocoon market opens, prices vary. On average, each dan sells for forty to fifty yuan. An eight-person household dedicates their energy to harvesting three or four dan of cocoons, which is considered a good year. After deducting costs, they earn only a few dozen yuan. Hence, it is said to be meager. Yet, farm women continue year after year without tiring because, from spring to summer, agricultural affairs are numerous, and funds are difficult to secure. Earning a surplus of a few dozen yuan allows them to make ends meet. In western Zhejiang, many farmers plant late-season rice, waiting until sericulture is finished before transplanting seedlings. This is why. This year, sericulture has been afflicted by wet heat at the start, followed by cold rain. The cocoon harvest is less than fifty percent of the usual. If prices are suppressed, or if purchasing is halted altogether, not only will silkworm women sigh, but what will the farmers rely on? This is the third area urgently needing relief.</p>
<p>As for measures to provide relief, concerning the first issue, people invariably say to restrict market prices and strictly prohibit hoarding. This is merely a temporary palliative. When goods are plentiful, they are cheap; when they are scarce, they are expensive. This cannot be forced. The ancients knew that cheap grain harms farmers, and expensive grain harms merchants. Therefore, they established the system of Ever-Normal Granaries, releasing and storing grain according to the times, to prevent extreme highs and lows. This truly benefits both farmers and merchants. Now, the decree to restore granaries has not been implemented in many counties. Those that have accumulated granary funds only aim to deposit and generate interest, without considering storing grain to help the people. Some even affix money to each sheng and dou of grain when handling equalization, just to cut corners. They don't realize that if farmers have grain, and the government buys it, market conditions will stabilize somewhat, and the people's food will be secure. If farmers have no grain, and the government transports and sells it, the price of rice will increase immediately, and hoarding will naturally decrease. The principle of ebb and flow depends on actual goods for its transition, and the farmers will benefit from it. However, the establishment of granaries is difficult from the start. It is better to first add warehouses to farmers' banks. Farmers can mortgage grain at market prices, set a date for redemption, and pay light interest. Between summer and autumn, when the old harvest is running out and the new one is not yet ready, they can seek reliable guarantors (either merchants, landowners, or village chiefs, without limiting it to farmers' associations or cooperatives to prevent manipulation) to lend monthly funds, repayable with new grain. This is genuinely beneficial to farmers in several ways. First, turning distress sales into active mortgages. Second, reducing heavy interest to lighter rates. Third, monthly funds can be used to obtain rice, avoiding exploitation by shops. Fourth, new grain can be used to repay loans, saving the delay of husking. Although banks may not earn large profits, they will not suffer losses. The name implies that they have an obligation to fulfill. County governments should wait for this autumn's harvest and urgently establish granaries, releasing old grain and storing new grain, so that farmers will not suffer from high purchase prices and low sales prices. Then, their livelihoods will gradually recover, and agriculture will improve.</p>
<p>Second, cotton clothing and bedding are beneficial to our people nationwide. After the entry of foreign yarn, industrialists urgently planted Mexican and Chicken Foot cotton, and established yarn factories to resist it. At first, they gained profits, but then failed due to poor cotton harvests. This is the misfortune of the yarn factories. Cotton farmers in various places rush to buy factory yarn to make cloth, without thinking about improving their cotton cultivation. This is suicide for the cotton farmers. There is too much rain in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and American cotton fails repeatedly. Cotton from Tongzhou and Changyin is easier to cultivate. Cotton growers should disseminate seeds and guide cultivation, rewarding good cultivators. More importantly, society as a whole should promote the wearing of coarse cloth to demonstrate national frugality. Foreign yarn and mercerized yarn are soft and beautiful, but not as durable as domestic cotton. If schools and soldiers all wear coarse cloth, and with cotton-padded coats and bedding being essential for winter, the demand will increase sharply. Merchants will flock to it, cotton farmers will profit, and they will then manage their fields better, resulting in better yields and smooth sales. If we can restore the situation from ten years ago, hundreds of thousands of impoverished people on the coast will be resurrected from their plight.</p>
<p>Third, the government is well aware of the decline of the silk and cocoon industry and has ordered the suspension of export taxes. Government offices and banks in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are also planning cooperation and mutual circulation of funds to maintain sericulture. However, I have a further suggestion. If there is no way to sell silk abroad, the suspension of export taxes is merely an empty gesture. Cocoon merchants barely manage to buy new cocoons. If they are still stockpiled in warehouses in Shanghai, losses will increase, and next year will be even more desperate. The panic among silkworm farmers has not subsided. Of the countries that use silk in the world, the United States is the biggest. Japanese silk is quick enough to promote sales, but Chinese merchants cannot compete with it. However, one should also consider that China is indeed the largest market for silk sales. Considering the consumption of four hundred million people, how much silk fabric is needed? Without calculating this ourselves, and relying on other countries to be tail ends, is already very cautious. Before the opening of cocoon markets, villagers often cleaned cocoons and reeled silk themselves. The best quality was sold to silk shops, and the rest was kept for spinning, clothing the entire country. Fabrics such as cotton silk and domestic silk were also used by silkworm women. When cocoon merchants set up kilns to bake silkworms, transporting them away, villagers sought convenience and abandoned weaving. Silk industry leaders are concerned about the too rapid export of silk. Every time the proposal to expand cocoon markets is raised, it becomes a very big conflict. Provincial councils often have fierce political arguments. It has become clear that silk and cocoon industries cannot coexist. Now, they are linked and both are losing. The reason for the failure is that the stagnation of foreign sales is a key point, and not selling silk domestically is an even more critical concern. The reason for not selling is that artificial silk fabrics are taking over, accounting for a large part of the market. The general public likes them because they are cheap and beautiful. They are fragile and must be renewed every year, which promotes sales. Chinese goods like silk fabrics from Wuxing, Hangzhou, and Huzhou are sturdy and can last for three or four winters, but the prices are relatively high, so people are turned away. As for the clothing of the upper class and nobility, they look down on domestic goods and use foreign fine woolen fabrics. The prices are several times higher than domestic silk. Because of these two types of abandonment, there is a bad situation. Today, there are still silkworm old women in rural villages. Although reels and looms are lacking, they can be replaced. Village chiefs should encourage farm women to reel silk themselves. This is convenient for waiting for the best price and can also lead to weaving. One also hopes that government and business people will promote the production of everyday clothing, all using domestic silk and flat silk of various colors. In the past, Xie Anshi held a palm-leaf fan in his hand, and the capital immediately sold 50,000. The tiny things have a clear effect that can be seen. And Chinese silk is basically good and the color and style are not difficult to imitate. Now that the special donation from the silk weaving factory has been waived and the price of silk has returned to normal, various kinds of silk fabrics should be made to compete with artificial silk for beauty. Today's society has a reduced ability to live, but vanity has increased instead. I will assume that they like to use artificial silk, and I will add that Chinese silk is more durable. I can say that it can be sold without publicity. If trade is smooth, sericulture will flourish. This is of great importance to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and once it is promoted, it will not be difficult to recover large amounts of money and save our compatriots. It is not only the general view of the agricultural world, but also the advocates of the principle of people's livelihood, who should take action first.</p>
<p>In summary, the basic necessities of life for the people cannot be separated for a single day. I have planted cotton in the cloth district of Fengxian, and planted rice and raised silkworms in the southern part of Jiaxing for nineteen years. Based on what I have personally experienced, the different rises and falls in the past ten years have led to this. If we do not make plans when we lose the order, it will be like the rotting of fish, which is difficult to clean up. What my heart says is dangerous, so I offer my ignorance. I hope that the authorities and people from all walks of life will earnestly seek to benefit from this.</p>

The aforementioned simplified primary school curriculum standards may, depending on local conditions, only teach subjects such as national language, arithmetic, common sense, and physical education, reducing study time for drawing, music, and crafts, and may also be based on children's lives to formulate curriculum outlines of living units.</p>

<h3>Popularization of Lower-Level Science Training Begins with the Children's Science Correspondence School</h3>
<p>| One of the Five Major Trainings of the Entire Nation |</p>
<p>| A Letter from Tao Zhixing to Xu Duren |</p>
<p>Mr. Duren,</p>
<p>Your letter of June 23 has given us a lot of encouragement. The purpose of Principal Ding Zhuzhong and us founding the Children's Science Correspondence School is to contribute our knowledge and skills in educating children to teachers, parents, and children across the country. On the one hand, it is to make public the views of the foolish people and seek help from others. On the other hand, it is like an elementary school student writing an article hoping that everyone will guide them. If the Chinese nation wants to avoid destruction, it must unanimously carry out five major trainings across the country: (1) universal military training, so that everyone has the military power to defend the country; (2) universal production training, so that everyone has the technology to create wealth; (3) universal scientific training, so that everyone has the ability to investigate things and attain knowledge; (4) universal literacy training, so that everyone has the tools to communicate spirits; (5) universal literacy training, so that everyone knows that the Republic of China is a country of 400 million people and honestly and politely does the master of the country to create a Republic of China that lives up to its name. If one of these five trainings is lacking, a healthy nation cannot be created to adapt to the world of the 20th century. The Children's Science Correspondence School is the beginning of universal lower-level scientific training. A dozen of us are determined to open a path for it. However, if we want to complete the universal scientific training of the entire nation, we must have teachers, parents, children, young people, and the general public across the country rise up together and create themselves into scientific workers with both hands and brains. Only then can the future emit light. Mr. Your inquiry about the future happiness of children shows that you have a long-term vision, which I admire very much. I humbly believe that the future happiness of children should be built on their current lives. The current life is the most important life and should not be missed for a single day. I don’t know what the high-ranking opinion thinks.</p>
<p>Respectfully wishing you health,</p>
<p>Tao Zhixing, June 24, Year 21.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from an Ancient Temple (35)</h3>
<p>— A Reclusive Scholar Who Doesn't Weed His Courtyard</p>
<p>Thirty-eight *</p>
<p>After my younger brother and I finished copying the passages, we looked up the meaning of each one, clarified them, and then began to discuss. I said, "Fan Chi asking about farming and gardening could be considered a student concerned about agricultural matters, but he asked the wrong person. What's the use of asking a scholar about these things?" My younger brother said, "Confucius saying that he was not as good as old farmers in farming and not as good as old gardeners in gardening is the truth. Knowing what you know and admitting what you don't know is also a proper attitude for a teacher. It's a pity that Confucius didn't encourage Fan Chi to learn from old farmers and old gardeners. Instead, he secretly scolded him, only to warn his three thousand students. He only wanted his disciples to work on propriety, righteousness, and trustworthiness so they could become officials. He didn't want them to study farming and gardening. Anyone who studied farming and gardening would run into obstacles like Fan Chi and would be useless people." "But when Nan Gongkuo asked Confucius about the story of Yu and Ji personally farming to gain the world, why didn't Confucius answer? Why did he secretly praise Nan Gongkuo as a gentleman?" "Yu and Ji farming themselves is an ancient story that Confucius couldn't deny. Yu and Ji weren't ordinary old farmers; they were old farmers who became emperors, so they should be viewed differently. Fan Chi was a student, and Nan Gongkuo was a high official, so there had to be a distinction. If Fan Chi were a high official and Nan Gongkuo were a student, I suspect that the praise of 'gentleman' and the condemnation of 'small man' would be reversed. Otherwise, this contradiction is inexplicable." "Confucius said that a gentleman concerns himself with the Way and not with food. Then, a small man concerns himself with food and not with the Way. Wouldn't someone who concerns himself with both food and the Way be half gentleman and half small man? If a gentleman doesn't concern himself with food, where does his food come from? Confucius meant that learning the Way won't fill your stomach, and farming will make you starve. A gentleman is someone who can't fill his stomach by learning the Way. A small man is someone who starves by farming. It's unfair that someone who doesn't grow grain but eats his fill calls himself a gentleman, while someone who grows grain but has nothing to eat is scolded as a small man!" "According to Confucius's ideal, a country can't be entirely composed of gentlemen. If it were, no one would concern themselves with food or farming, and the gentlemen would starve to death. In his society, there must be a group of people who specialize in farming. These farmers must starve themselves to keep the gentlemen well-fed while they sit there and manage them. These people who starve themselves to fatten others are scolded as small men." "Confucius scolded farmers as small men, and the farmers didn't let him off the hook either. Look at the twelve characters: 'They don't toil with their limbs, they don't distinguish the five grains. Who is this teacher?' How fiercely they scolded him! It's clear that the farmers and Confucius didn't get along well." "But why do Chinese farmers always worship Confucius even now, and why is his tablet enshrined in every private school?" We couldn't understand, so Mr. Zhu said, "Confucius is the representative of landlords. 'Concern yourself with the Way and not with food' means that they have land rent to collect and can eat ready-made food. Private schools are the landlords' means of anesthetization. Emperors and landlords use Confucius as an idol, and Confucius's disciples, who are fond of good food, laziness, and aspiring to officialdom and wealth, preach everywhere. Farmers have been anesthetized like this for over two thousand years, so they're confused." Good, the question of the tablet is no longer a problem.</p>

<h3>Dalian Customs Issue</h3>
<p>The Inspector General of Customs Formally Notifies the Japanese Legation Yesterday</p>
<p>The Japanese Legation Will Reply Today</p>
<p>The Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Maze, has dismissed Mr. Fukumoto, the Dalian Customs Commissioner, for retaining tax revenues and disobeying orders, and has appointed another Japanese person to succeed him. Inspector General Maze formally notified the Japanese Legation yesterday based on the 1907 Dalian Treaty. After receiving Mr. Maze's notification, the Japanese Legation did not express any opinion on the change of the Dalian Customs Commissioner but will deliver a reply note today by Mr. Moriya, the First Secretary of the Japanese Legation, acting as Chargé d'Affaires. It is said that the new Dalian Customs Commissioner appointed by Mr. Maze is Mr. Ryuzo Inokuma, currently the Yichang Customs Commissioner.</p>
<p>Reuters, Shanghai, 26th – The Inspector General of Customs, Sir Maze, issued the following statement this afternoon: External rumors that the Japanese government has announced the dismissal of Dalian Customs Commissioner Fukumoto violate Article 3 of the 1907 Dalian Treaty. When Inspector General Maze was asked about this matter, he stated that the Customs authorities' dismissal of Fukumoto did not violate the treaty and did not require consultation with the Kwantung Government. For clarity, the first three articles of the treaty are quoted below: (1) The Dalian Customs Commissioner or Chief must be of Japanese nationality. The Inspector General of Customs will consult with the Japanese Legation in Beijing to reach an understanding when appointing new personnel. (2) All officials of the Dalian Customs should be of Japanese nationality as a rule, but in the event of sudden vacancies or temporary needs, personnel of other nationalities may be temporarily assigned to Dalian. (3) The Inspector General of Customs will notify the Governor of the Leased Territory before changing the Dalian Customs Commissioner. Sir Maze said that it is clear from this that the first article must be followed before implementing the third article. Traditionally, before changing the Dalian Customs Commissioner, the Kwantung authorities are never notified until after consultation and agreement with the Japanese Legation. Fukumoto's successor has now been appointed, and after obtaining the agreement of the Japanese Legation, the Governor of the Leased Territory will be notified in accordance with the third article. Sir Maze also said that Fukumoto's disobedience was unprecedented in the history of the Customs.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Strongly Advocate for Preserving the Shanghai Arsenal</h3>
<p>Zhang Yuejun and Others Request the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs to Handle with Caution</p>
<p>Even if the Old Site is Not Used, a Factory Should Still Be Built and Production Resumed</p>
<p>Workers Preventing Transportation: Representatives Go to Beijing Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that regarding the abolition of the Shanghai Arsenal, after representatives of the Shanghai factory workers, Hu Sihong, Lin Weirong, and Wang Chengfu, went to Beijing to appeal to various military and political authorities, they have gained full understanding from all parties. The General Staff Headquarters, the Ministry of the Navy, and the former Shanghai factory directors, Zhang Yuejun and Guo Chengen, strongly advocate for preserving the Shanghai factory. The military and political authorities have shown signs of accommodating this view. However, the old site of the Shanghai factory may not be suitable, and it may be necessary to select another site to build a factory and resume production in the future. The current representatives staying in Beijing, Hu Sihong, telegraphed to invite the returned Shanghai representatives, Lin and Wang, to come to Beijing for discussions. Mr. Wang was unable to do so due to official duties, so the director of the machinery factory, Ma Dejian, accompanied Mr. Lin Weirong and took the night train to Beijing yesterday. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attitudes of Various Parties: The military and political organs in Beijing attach great importance to the matter of the Shanghai factory's survival or abolition, as it is crucial to military preparedness. Acting Minister Chen of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs fully understands the importance of not dispersing the Shanghai factory's machinery and the urgent need to maintain employment for the unemployed workers. He has telegraphed Chairman Chiang to provide detailed information and request instructions. The Director of the Ordnance Department, Hong Zhong, and the department's section chiefs and special commissioners are particularly sympathetic to the need to preserve the Shanghai factory's machinery as a whole and to resume production quickly. The General Staff Headquarters also strongly opposes the military's proposal to abolish the Shanghai factory. They have sent an official letter to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, firmly advocating for preserving the Shanghai factory's machinery as a whole and selecting another site to build a factory and resume production. If the construction funds are insufficient, the Shanghai factory's land can be sold. Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan also believes that the installations and repairs of the Ministry's warships and artillery, as well as the guns and ammunition, are all supplied by the Shanghai factory, so he also strongly advocates for the quick resumption of production. The former Shanghai factory directors, Zhang Yuejun and Guo Chengen, who worked to expand manufacturing capacity and purchase new machinery at a cost of over one million yuan during their tenure, feel that it would be inappropriate to heed the absurd proposals of one or two German nationals seeking to develop their country's commerce and to abolish the Shanghai factory without careful research by the ordnance conference. They have each sent letters to the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs in their personal capacity, requesting careful handling. If the old site of the Shanghai factory cannot be used, a factory should still be built and production resumed at another site.</p>
<p>Zhuang Quan Resigns: The proposal to abolish the Shanghai factory this time is merely an attempt by one or two German advisors to develop their country's arms trade. After representatives of the Shanghai factory workers went to Beijing to appeal to the authorities and gained full understanding from the authorities, Zhuang Quan, the former director of the Shanghai factory's machinery factory, now a special commissioner of the Ordnance Department and a member of the purchasing committee, followed the German advisors' wishes and also advocated for abolishing the Shanghai factory, despite having been sent by the department to inspect various factories and knowing that the Shanghai factory had the best performance. All parties expressed deep dissatisfaction. Mr. Zhuang felt strongly attacked by all parties and became very passive. He has asked the Director of the Ordnance Department, Hong Zhong, to resign from his position as commissioner. Preventing Transportation: The labor union has telegraphed all transportation companies across the country, prohibiting them from transporting the arsenal's machinery and warning the "Committee for Handling Shanghai Arsenal Machinery and Materials" in Nanjing not to send personnel to Hangzhou to transport the Shanghai factory's machinery, to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Lin and Ma Go to Beijing: After the director of the gun and ammunition factory, Lin Weirong, and the director of the artillery factory, Wang Chengfu, returned to Shanghai, they continued to consult with Hu Sihong, the chief of the review and inspection department, who remained in Beijing, by long-distance telephone. As Hu sent a telegram inviting them, Director Wang was unable to go to Beijing due to official duties, so Director Lin accompanied the director of the machinery factory, Gao Dejian, and took the night train to Beijing last night to meet with Hu and discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Retreat from the Tongwen College Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>When the Shanghai war broke out, the faculty and students of the Tongwen College, established by the Japanese in Xujiahui, took their important documents and moved to Hongkou. The Jing'an Temple Police Station sent more than 20 Indian constables to the college to protect the school's equipment. Later, when our army retreated to the second line of defense, the Japanese army sent a small squad of marines from Zhongshan Road to Xujiahui Hongqiao Road and stationed them in the Tongwen College. The Indian constables stationed in the college were withdrawn. The Japanese marines stationed in the college numbered more than 30 and hung a wooden sign reading "Dispatch Team of the Great Japanese Marines, Tongwen College" at the entrance. During the day, they were stationed inside the college, and at night, squads patrolled around the school. After repeated negotiations with the Japanese side by our members of the Joint Committee, Yu Hongjun and Wen Yingxing, the Japanese side agreed to withdraw within the shortest possible time. It is now learned that all the military supplies and luggage of the marines were loaded onto three trucks and transported to the headquarters of the Japanese Marines at the end of North Sichuan Road the day before yesterday afternoon, and the more than 30 marines stationed in the college were completely withdrawn yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Oppose the Withdrawal of Troops from District D</h3>
<p>Secret Meeting Held from the Night Before Last Until Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that Japanese troops will be withdrawn from the China-Japan Cotton Mill, the Great China Cotton Mill, Tongwen College, and other locations, as well as from District D. The Japanese residents in the city were greatly alarmed upon hearing this news. More than 100 Japanese residents, all representatives of various shops, held a secret meeting at the Japanese Club on Wenjian Shi Road until yesterday morning. They resolved to petition the Japanese authorities in Shanghai not to implement the withdrawal of troops in order to protect the safety of Japanese residents. Although the wave of Chinese resistance to Japanese goods is not as intense as before, the impact on the Japanese side is still significant, so they still plan to ask the Japanese authorities to negotiate with the Chinese side to suppress it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Help Traitors Invade North China</h3>
<p>Talks by People from the Northeast</p>
<p>The Authorities Must Not Neglect</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that a gentleman from the Eastern Provinces who came to Shanghai yesterday told a reporter from the Far East News Agency that the atmosphere of Japan helping the Northeast rebel army to invade North China has become increasingly serious. Currently, in the Jinzhou area, the Japanese are presiding over the training of the rebel army, having recruited 200,000 ignorant and foolish people for strict military training. All levels of instructors are Japanese officers. It is expected that the training will be completed in February, and in early September, the rebel army will begin to attack Yuguan, attempting to sweep across North China and invade the country. The slogan "Restoring the Old Country" has been decided upon. If the treacherous plan succeeds, the Japanese intend to drive the people of the Eastern Provinces into the customs and distribute them throughout North China, and then transplant Koreans to the Northeast. As for the Korean Peninsula, it will be entirely inhabited and cultivated by Japanese people. This dangerous plan is actively underway, and it is hoped that the authorities will not neglect it.</p>

<p>Declaration Issued: The Shanghai Citizens' Rent Reduction Movement Committee's declaration from the third representatives' conference states that since the January 28th Incident, the rent reduction movement has become an important issue. After months of running around and appealing, people from all walks of life and government authorities have recognized it as a reasonable action, which is gratifying to the members of this committee. However, this committee is entrusted by all the citizens and bears a heavy and great mission. As the rent reduction movement has not yet reached its final success, and looking ahead, we still feel that it is full of thorns. First, in terms of the landlord's side, some say that rent reduction hinders the landlord's property rights, others say that rent reduction is tantamount to taking responsibility for this war, and some even say that the landlord's relationship with the tenant is a kind of grace, and they can live there if they want to, otherwise they can leave, why bother with rent reduction. All these kinds of arguments are enough to confuse people's minds. However, everyone knows that so-called property rights are the landlord's ownership rights. We ask, does the result of rent reduction change the landlord's ownership rights in the slightest? It is precisely because we respect the landlord's property rights that we ask for rent reduction; otherwise, the tenant can reduce the rent automatically. As for the damage caused by this war, in addition to the absolute responsibility of Japanese imperialism, we, the Chinese people, do not need to be self-conscious. The rent reduction is not a matter of responsibility, but a method of relief after damage. It is a principle that all mankind should help each other, and it is not only humanitarianism. Otherwise, why would the landlord ask for exemption from land taxes and water and electricity fees? Furthermore, the relationship between landlord and tenant is in fact a contractual act of equal rights and obligations, and it cannot be regarded as a kind of grace. If the so-called "ten thousand houses, sheltering all the poor in the world," is asked, is this really the case in fact? I am afraid that those who start a business with real estate are everywhere. Taking a step back, even if the logic of "If the landlord does not build a house, where does the tenant live?" can be established, then on the contrary, "If the tenant does not rent a house, what is the use of the landlord's house?" This kind of argument lacking common sense, the tenant is ashamed to open his mouth. Secondly, in terms of the municipal authorities, they think that rent reduction is a legal issue and cannot be reached by administrative power. Everyone knows that the price of rent is related to the prosperity and decline of society, and the relief of damage after the war is especially the key to restoring social prosperity. Therefore, its essence is a social issue, which is closely related to municipal construction, and it is not just a simple legal event. It is very clear that clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four major needs of life. Modern life is even closer to food and housing. It is true that one is indispensable. In the past, due to the high price of rice, which hindered people's livelihood, our municipal authorities took measures to restrict the price of rice. If we balance it with the saying of free trade, wouldn't it be against it? However, those who bowed their heads and did not speak also knew that rice was not comparable to ordinary commodities. It must not be hoarded and monopolized, causing social unrest. The problem of housing is a major need in life. If a method of suppression and restriction is not planned, then when things reach the extreme, there will eventually be a day when the entire society collapses, and it will be a blessing for the country and the nation. Moreover, after the great war, the losses of the people have reached an extreme. Rent reduction is only a palliative relief. The municipal authorities should exercise the powers granted to them and implement the relief of the people's suffering. Fortunately, do not be overly concerned with the rights of a few people. In short, rent reduction is not only in line with the principles of economics and the provisions of the law, but in fact, there are also precedents to follow. In the distant past, after the European War and the Japanese earthquake, there were rent reductions. In the near past, in places such as Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Anqing, the government clearly ordered reductions. Shanghai is an area of actual warfare, and both directly and indirectly, it has been damaged. Separately reducing and exempting is a fair and impartial proposition. We sincerely hope that our wise revolutionary government will follow the late Premier's will, consider the situation of damage in this city, and refer to the measures previously set by this committee to handle them separately in order to relieve the suffering. This is what all the citizens are praying for. Finally, this committee dares to tell the tenants of the city with the utmost sincerity that our move actually contains the important meanings of saving the city's economic decline, restoring the vitality of the majority of citizens, and consolidating the foundation of the citizens' unity to resist foreign aggression. Although our hearts are painful, we are not discouraged. Although our strength is exhausted, we are not lazy. We will continue to work hard and move forward. We hope that all tenants in the city will understand this and rise up to work hard and work together to achieve the final success. This is our sincere hope. This declaration is hereby made, and we hope that everyone will take it into account.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Silk Factory Strike Expands</h3>
<p>Tongwei, Yujing, Jinglun Join Yesterday</p>
<p>Yuanfeng, Tongyi and Other Factories Temporarily Shut Down</p>
<p>Labor Union Schedules Negotiations with Management Today</p>
<p>Following the strike by workers at the Yichang, Yuncheng, Xiangcheng, and other three silk factories in Hongkou, protesting management's wage reductions, the situation has become serious. Yesterday afternoon, the Tongwei, Yujing, and Jinglun factories also went on strike. As a result, Yuanfeng, Tongyi, and other six factories will be automatically shut down by the factory management starting today. The detailed information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Strike Spreads: Yichang Silk Factory on Yuezhou Road has 232 silk reeling machines, Xiangcheng Silk Factory on Tiantong Road has 264 silk reeling machines, and Yuncheng Silk Factory has 216 silk reeling machines. All 1,068 workers, due to the fact that the daily wage for silk factories in the city was originally 58 cents, but now the management of each factory is using the excuse of poor business conditions to reduce it to 42 cents. Negotiations were ineffective, so the strike was implemented. Yesterday, the Tongwei Silk Factory on Wuzhou Road with 208 silk reeling machines, the Yujing Silk Factory with 208 silk reeling machines, and the Jinglun and other three factories, were still operating as usual. However, when work resumed at 1 PM, the striking workers flocked over to demand united action. The workers, seeing the unfavorable situation, joined the strike.</p>
<p>Temporary Shutdown: After the workers at Yichang and other silk factories in Hongkou went on strike, the silk factory trade association held an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. The current silk industry is in a state of extreme decline, and all factories are on the verge of bankruptcy. In order to maintain the livelihoods of employees and settle pawned silver, they are barely managing to operate. Moreover, the wage reduction affects everyone. Now that the workers do not sympathize with the management and have gone on strike, a decision was made to resolve the matter according to the law. Factories that have not yet gone on strike will have to temporarily shut down. As a result, Yuanfeng and other six silk factories on Tiantong Road will all be shut down starting today.</p>
<p>Demands Made: The Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, opposed to the arbitrary wage reductions by the management of various factories, the destruction of labor-management agreements, and the extension of working hours, has presented three conditions to the trade association: (1) Recently, each factory has been pursuing speed over quality in production, resulting in poor silk quality, which is of great concern to the future of the silk industry. It is demanded that the original state be restored. (2) Working hours are from 5:30 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 1:00 PM to 5:30 PM, a total of 11 hours. Currently, each factory has arbitrarily extended the hours to 12. It is demanded that the original state be restored. (3) Wages are 58 cents, but now each factory has arbitrarily changed it to 42 cents. It is demanded that the original state be restored.</p>
<p>Negotiations Underway: The union sent directors Le Xiaorong and Chen Xiufu to consult with Zhang Peishen, director of the Hongkou office of the silk factory trade association. Regarding the issues of product quality and working hours, the trade association agreed to be responsible for advising each factory not to violate the old practices. However, the wage issue, as it concerns everyone, will be considered before a reply is given. As a result, the matter remains unresolved. It is heard that the union has scheduled a meeting for 8 AM today to discuss concrete measures, and will negotiate with the trade association again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Union Notice: The council of the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union issued a notice stating: "This is to inform you that since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, silk factories have taken the opportunity to cut wages. The union has repeatedly received requests from workers in various factories, requesting that we argue reasonably and restore the original treatment in order to maintain their livelihoods. The union has understood all of this. The union's responsibility is to protect the interests of workers. How can we remain indifferent? Regarding this recent reduction in treatment by the factories, we have formulated a plan to resolutely implement and seek a solution for our union. We hope that our workers will wait quietly. However, before there is a proper solution, there may inevitably be troublemakers who seize the opportunity to stir up trouble and incite our workers to take extraordinary actions, thereby causing unexpected disputes and hindering the progress of the union's plan. This would be unfortunate. Therefore, we specially inform our workers to work with peace of mind and not be confused or swayed, so as to avoid unnecessary disputes. You must know that the union is concerned about the hardships of our workers in every way and dare not relax for a moment. Therefore, if any workers have any opinions, please report them directly to the union. The union will base its effective struggle and efforts on the wishes of the workers and strive to achieve success. Therefore, it is hereby announced that all workers should take note of this and not take any unnecessary actions. This is of utmost importance. This notice is given."</p>
<p>Attitudes of Labor and Management: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency met with Shen a chairman of the Silk Factory Trade Association yesterday. According to him, the current strike by workers in Hongkou silk factories is due to the wage reduction issue. However, the silk factories currently in operation are purely to maintain the livelihoods of the workers and settle pawned silver. Moreover, reeled silk is bound to lose money. The trade association hopes that the workers will understand the situation and be mutually understanding in order to find a solution and avoid the spread of the strike. If the workers insist and advise the factories to strike, then the factories that are barely maintaining operations, 13 in Zhabei, 6 in the Concession, and 3 in Nanshi, will also temporarily cease work in order to seek a proper solution. According to a union director, the workers at Yichang and other factories are striking over the wage issue. They hope that the management of each factory will sympathize with the workers, negotiate sincerely, and accept the workers' demands in order to avoid the expansion of the strike and seek a solution.</p>
<p>Other Strike Reports: The silk factory industry in this city is in a slump and on the verge of bankruptcy. There are a total of 113 silk factories (single and double cocoon) in the city. Currently, those that are barely operating include 11 in the Hongkou district, such as Yichang, 6 in the Concession district, such as Xinchang, 13 in the Xinzha district, such as Fusi, and 2 in the Nanshi district, such as Baotairen. These operating silk factories are mostly commissioned by silk cocoon merchants and the financial industry to reel old cocoons that were pawned last year. As for the factories reeling new cocoons, it is only because the cocoon merchants cannot pawn new cocoons that they commission the silk factories to reel the cocoons into silk for sale or to pawn the silk for cash. Very few silk factories themselves are purchasing new cocoons this year, only two or three. The rest are reeling silk for customers. Unexpectedly, a strike suddenly broke out at the Yichang, Yuncheng, and Xiangcheng silk factories in the Hongkou district from the day before yesterday. The workers' reasons are that the working hours have been extended from 11 hours to 12 hours, and the wages have been reduced from 58 cents to 42 cents. They demand the restoration of the original wages and working hours. The union has sent representatives, such as Chen Xiupu, to the silk factory trade association to make demands. The trade association believes that this matter concerns the interests of all the companies in the city and will wait until a general meeting of all members is convened this week before replying. It is now heard that the union has reported the matter to the party and government agencies, requesting them to mediate. The management believes that in this strike, the workers are not considering the difficulties of the management. Each factory is resuming business purely out of consideration for the livelihoods of the workers. The factory owners have no comments on the strike.</p>
<h3>Pharmacy Workers Warn Management Yesterday</h3>
<p>Salary Increase Committee to Discuss Measures Today</p>
<p>Union Issues Emergency Declaration Yesterday</p>
<p>Trade Association Also Schedules Meeting Today</p>
<p>All the employees of the traditional Chinese medicine industry in this city believe that the employers' refusal to use substitute workers from other businesses violates the contract, which led to serious disputes and a tendency of strikes. The situation yesterday is listed below:</p>
<p>Today's Meeting: The pharmacy workers decided to make a number of requests when they convened a general meeting the day before yesterday, and established a salary increase campaign committee to be responsible for submitting the requests to the employers for negotiation. If there is no result, a final action will be taken. It is reported that the committee decided to hold an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM today to discuss the next steps and countermeasures.</p>
<p>Letter to Employers: The Pharmacy Workers Union sent a letter to the National Medicine Trade Association yesterday, warning: "Respectfully informing you, the labor and management conditions signed by our union and your association are originally valid forever. Since the re-promulgation of the Trade Union Law last spring, the party and government agencies in this city have explicitly announced that all labor and management contracts previously signed in this city will continue to be valid. However, on the sixteenth of this month, your association suddenly disclosed a proposal in the newspapers, completely destroying the original labor and management conditions. After reading it, the members of our association were extremely indignant. Although the responsible personnel of our association repeatedly persuaded them, it was difficult to take effect. Therefore, on the 24th of this month, we held a general meeting of all member representatives to discuss countermeasures. Afterwards, it was decided to give a written warning first. Based on this, we are specially recording the case as a warning. We hope that you will dismiss the previous proposal in order to maintain the conditions and abide by the laws. It will be fortunate if you can do so. Otherwise, if a storm is brewed in the future, your association will be responsible for all the consequences. Do not say that we did not warn you in advance. This is a special warning. Please check. Sincerely. The union also sent similar warnings to Cai, Tongde, Feng Cunren, and Ye Tiande and other drugstores.</p>
<p>Union Declaration: The Pharmacy Union issued an emergency declaration yesterday, stating: "To all workers in the city and compatriots from all walks of life, since our industry's employees established the union in 1920, we have always been committed to labor-management cooperation, seeking business development, and liberating suffering. However, at this time when the European style is prevalent in the East and Western medicine is popular, the Chinese medicine employers are not seeking commercial victories, but are trying to oppress the workers, which has led to endless disputes and even several slowdowns. This is the past history of our industry. However, it is well known that the slowdown of our industry's employees is related to the lives of patients in society. However, due to different circumstances, there are unspeakable secrets. For example, recently, when the Japanese pirates invaded our country and the national crisis was urgent, the social panic was extreme, and unemployment increased sharply. The Chinese medicine employers not only did not seek relief, but arbitrarily destroyed labor and management conditions, used excuses to dismiss employees, and rejected unemployed substitute workers. Such vicious means have made our industry's employees intolerable and extremely indignant. Therefore, a general meeting of all employee representatives was held. It was decided unanimously to deny the employers' above-mentioned actions. Since the social cost of living is increasing day by day, the original wages can hardly maintain a living. The employers have repeatedly increased the retail prices. Therefore, we have also proposed to increase wages. Fearing that all workers and compatriots from all walks of life in the city do not know the truth, we will briefly explain the outline. We ask for your fair judgment. This declaration is hereby given."</p>
<p>Employer Attitude: The National Medicine Trade Association of this city believes that the employees of this industry suddenly proposed a salary increase request of up to ten yuan per month to the employers at a time when the war has just stopped and the business is depressed, and intend to strike in order to coerce them, which is not considering the commercial situation. The labor dispute has been reported in the newspapers in recent days, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious, with a tendency to erupt at any moment. If unfortunately the strike becomes a reality, it will have a great impact on social stability at this time of summer epidemic prevention. Therefore, we should urgently plan for remedial measures in order to save the crisis and eliminate hidden dangers. The association is scheduled to convene an emergency executive committee at 2:00 PM today at the association hall at No. 242 Dong Province Road, North Henan Road, Lao Bazi Road to discuss countermeasures for the labor dispute. In addition to notifying all executive committee members to attend, we also specially invite all members of the city to attend together in order to negotiate everything. However, we will resolutely reject the illegal demands of the union and swear not to accept them. We also issued a special declaration refuting the union's slanderous remarks.</p>
<p>Central Investigation: The Central People's Movement Committee sent a special commissioner to Shanghai, Jiang Hao, because a labor dispute occurred in the Chinese medicine industry, which is related to local security and patients' lives. He went to both labor and management of the pharmacy industry the day before yesterday to investigate the truth in order to verify the case.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow's Memorial Service for Martyrs on Two Railways</h3>
<p>Meeting in the Morning, Groundbreaking Ceremony for Monument in the Afternoon. The memorial service for the employees of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway who died in the national crisis will be held at the North Railway Station at 10:00 AM on the 28th of this month, and preparations are being made in advance. It is heard that the Ministry of Railways in Nanjing will send Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming to Shanghai to preside over the ceremony. There will be eleven assistant participants, including Chen Xinghan, Director of the Railway Bureau, Zheng Baozhao, Chief of the Transportation Department, Wang Shengshan, Chief of the Mechanical Department, Min Luochu, representative of the Union, and Ding Zhenheng, Secretary of the Railway Bureau. At the same time, the Preparatory Committee will submit a request to the Railway Bureau to notify all stations along the two railways to remain silent for three minutes at the time, and all locomotives parked at each station will release steam for one minute to show mourning. In recent days, people from all walks of life have sent wreaths and elegiac couplets, which are extremely crowded. Among the important figures of the National Government, such as Wang Zhaoming, Jiang Zhongzheng, Yu Youren, Gu Mengyu, Song Ziwen, Zhang Xueliang, Li Tiao-sheng, Zhang Renjie, Chen Mingshu, Zhang Fakui, Zhang Zhizhong, and Li Liejun, all have elegiac couplets. From group standpoints, there are the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, the Gendarmerie Headquarters, the Jinpu, Pinghan, Pingsui, Xiang-E, Zhengtai and other railways, and the unions of various industries in this port. Leaders from all walks of life, such as Huang Jinrong, Du Yong, Wang Yiting, and Wang Xiaolai, also sent wreaths and elegiac couplets. The total number is no less than one thousand. It is also heard that the association will present commemorative badges to outside guests on the day. The association's reception office will start working from today, located in the office of the police headquarters of the two railways in the North Railway Station.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for the Employees of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway who died in the National Crisis notified all walks of life yesterday: "Respectfully informing you, during the recent invasion of Shanghai by the Japanese bandits, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was the first to bear the brunt. The employees of the railway worked bravely during the fierce fighting to maintain transportation, regardless of life and death. As a result, more than 20 people died in the line of duty. Now that the war has subsided and transportation has resumed, Chen, Director of our Bureau, and the colleagues of the two railways, remember the loyalty and are saddened. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for the Employees of the Two Railways Who Died in the National Crisis was organized to prepare for the memorial service. It has been decided that the memorial service will be held at the North Railway Station in Shanghai at 10:00 AM on June 28, and a special train will go to Wusong at 1:00 PM in the afternoon to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the memorial monument for the employees who died in the line of duty. We have always admired your high moral character and lofty reputation. We are specially sending this letter to you, respectfully requesting that you attend the ceremony at that time to show solemnity and express mourning. We are extremely grateful." (The rest is omitted.)</p>
<h3>Qi'an Gathering to Continue Memorial and Salvation for Two Days</h3>
<p>This port's Qi'an Gathering to commemorate and save the souls of the soldiers and compatriots who died in the anti-Japanese battle in Northeast and Shanghai, set up an altar in the Yuan Gong Ancestral Hall on Guoyutang Street, has been reported in the previous newspapers. Now, due to repeated requests from people from all walks of life, the gathering will continue for two days and nights on June 28 and 29, and the address is still there.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Will Discuss the Case of Road Construction Beyond the Border</h3>
<p>Results May Be Available in Mid-July. The management methods for road construction beyond the border have been basically settled after Mr. Yu Hongjun and Mr. Feixin Dun, who represents the Public Works Department, contacted. There is nothing significant to obstruct. Therefore, the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department can submit it for discussion at the regular meeting this week, and a result may be obtained in mid-July. However, the Japanese side believes that the success of this matter violates their interests. It is expected that the Japanese directors will have different expressions at that time, but it may not hinder the progress of this matter.</p>
<h3>The Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee Temporarily Allocates 300,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>200,000 Yuan Will Be Allocated When Finances Are Sufficient. The Songhu War Zone Rehabilitation Committee, because various matters of post-war rehabilitation in the war zone are waiting to be dealt with and funds are urgently needed, has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to allocate 500,000 yuan from the principal and interest of bonds issued this year to provide relief and restore vitality. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance to allocate it after deliberation. The Ministry of Finance believes that it is difficult to raise funds at this time of national treasury deficits, and that the needs of the war zone cannot be delayed. Therefore, it was negotiated with the Central Bank of China and other banks to temporarily borrow 300,000 yuan and allocate it to the committee to provide relief for the post-war rehabilitation of the war zone. The remaining 200,000 yuan will be allocated when finances are sufficient.</p>
<h3>Railway Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming Discusses the Plan to Expand the National Railway</h3>
<p>The Loss of the Two Railways in the Shanghai War Reached More Than 20 Million</p>
<p>It is Determined That the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Will Be in Charge of the Negotiations</p>
<p>Railway Vice Minister Zeng Zhongming arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning on official business, and hurriedly returned to the capital that night. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency interviewed Mr. Zeng at his residence yesterday and discussed the Sino-British plan to develop the national railway. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tongxi Railway: According to Mr. Zeng, the central government has recently devoted itself to the expansion of the national railway. There are currently four projects under planning and implementation. The first is the Tongxi Railway, which extends from Tongguan to Xi'an, and requires a total cost of more than 14 million yuan. The construction funds are still being raised. This road is an important route in Guanzhong. Once completed, it can be connected to the Longhai Railway and become the only trunk road in Guanzhong.</p>
<p>Yuehan Railway: The second is to actively complete the Yuehan Railway. The construction of the Yuehan Railway has been going on for some time, but it has not been completed early. The construction cost of the railway has been decided to be allocated from the Boxer Indemnity, but it is allocated in installments over a long period of time, which is not enough to solve the urgent need. Therefore, it has now been decided to borrow from other parties with the allocated funds as collateral, and it is decided to complete the entire railway in four years. The construction cost of the railway is estimated to be about 50 to 60 million yuan.</p>
<p>Datong Railway: In addition, there are currently two projects under planning and implementation: the Datong Railway and the Shigun Railway. The Datong Railway extends from Daguan in Shanxi Province to Tongguan, and it is connected to the Tongxi and Longhai Railways on the same day. This is indispensable for transportation, communication, and military purposes. After this road is completed, the remote areas in the northwest can be reached in the morning and evening, and the natural products of the northwest border can also be developed.</p>
<p>Shigun Railway: As for the Shigun Railway, it extends from Shijiazhuang in Shanxi to Dagu. It is planned to be completed within two years at the same time as the Datong Railway. The cost of the Datong and Shigun Railways is currently being estimated. The construction cost is borrowed from a French company, and an agreement has been reached. Construction can begin in a few months.</p>
<p>Pukou Ferry: Regarding the joint transportation of the Pingpu Railway and the Jinghu Railway, the Ministry of Railways has decided to build a large-scale ferry in Pukou, with a cost of 1 million yuan. It is expected to be completed next spring. After the ferry is completed, the joint transportation of the Pingpu Railway will be completely successful. Not only will it be convenient for merchants and travelers, but also the development of the Pingpu and Jinghu Railways can be predicted.</p>
<p>Loss of the Two Railways: As for the Japanese army's invasion of Shanghai, the loss of the two railways was extremely heavy. It is still under investigation. In addition to the two railway bureaus being responsible for the investigation, the Ministry of Railways has also sent personnel to Shanghai to assist in the investigation. The estimated loss is at least more than 20 million yuan. This loss not only directly affects our country, but also the Central Corporation, which is in the position of creditor, is also affected to a considerable extent. In the future, the negotiations will be led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Safeguards Inland Waterway Navigation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in order to safeguard inland waterway navigation, based on proposals from the inland steamer and coal barge industries, resolved through a members' general meeting to petition the National Government to clearly define the functions and powers of the seaport quarantine stations. It also separately submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, requesting regulations for uniform ship registration methods and prohibiting Zhejiang Province from levying surcharges on passenger and cargo fares on small steamers. The original petitions are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Clearly Defining the Functions and Powers of Seaport Quarantine Stations</h3>
<p>Petition submitted regarding a request. The association held its third members' general meeting on June 18th, according to a proposal from the Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association, requesting the government to announce the future scope of work of the Seaport Quarantine Administration to reassure shipowners. It states that seaport quarantine is originally a hygiene administration matter. Foreign imported ships are inevitably at risk of spreading infectious diseases due to overcrowding. They should be inspected. However, civilian ships exclusively operate on inland rivers and have designated hospitals by the association for disinfection and treatment, without the need for the administration to take over. Observing the past work of the National Seaport Quarantine Administration established last year, it has only disturbed merchant ships and levied huge amounts of health donations. If there is any non-compliance, ships are arbitrarily detained. Our association has repeatedly petitioned the Municipal Executive Committee for relief, and received Approval No. 782, stating that the Seaport Quarantine Administration has been ordered by the Ministry of Interior to cease operations since November 20th of the 20th year of the Republic. Now, suddenly reading in the May 15th newspaper a Nanjing telegram, the Legislative Yuan held its 185th regular meeting on the 14th, according to a report from the Legal System Committee of this Yuan, reviewing the draft of the Organizational Regulations for the National Seaport Quarantine Administration, a resolution was passed for amendment and approval. Reading it, we are extremely alarmed. The past actions of the former National Seaport Quarantine Administration not only did not help matters, but also obstructed merchant ships and the livelihood of shipowners. Now that the National Seaport Quarantine Administration Organizational Regulations have been passed by the Legislative Yuan, the future work guidelines should be made public by the Legislative Yuan and relevant departments to reassure shipping. Whether there is any consideration, respectfully a public resolution, etc. On that day, the members' general meeting resolved to approve it and handed it over to the Executive Committee for handling. The establishment of the Seaport Quarantine Administration, as the name suggests, its functions and powers should naturally be limited to seaports. At the beginning of the establishment of the Administration last year, it suddenly expanded its scope beyond its functions and powers, under the guise of disinfecting inland ships. All small steamers and various sailing ships operating on inland rivers were forced to enter into annual contracts, with annual fees ranging from twenty to five taels. Even barges could hardly avoid it. Otherwise, ships would be detained, causing widespread anxiety among merchants. Fortunately, the Municipal Party Department consulted with the Ministry of Interior and ordered the Administration to cease collecting fees for disinfecting inland steamers and sailing ships. The business situation was slightly stabilized. However, the Administration handled this matter last year by invoking the self-formulated Rules for Disinfection of Inner Harbor Ships, which had already been approved for promulgation. Therefore, it was pointed out that inland rivers were also included. In fact, international hygiene administration and domestic hygiene administration have their own special divisions, and seaports and inner harbors have completely different meanings. Various ships in the municipal district must comply with regulations and pay various donations and fees to the Public Utilities Bureau and the Finance Bureau, as well as the two bureaus of the concession, bearing a heavy burden. If fees are imposed again, it will inevitably lead to incidents. What shipowners are worried about is that when the Legislative Yuan is drafting regulations, it will expand its duties from seaports to inland rivers. The same mistakes of last year may reappear now. It is appropriate to record the case and submit it to your office for review. Please inform the Legislative Yuan that the functions and powers of the Administration should be strictly defined, limited to seaport quarantine only, and not involve the scope of inland rivers. By clearly defining the boundaries in the regulations, the Administration will not expand its functions and powers without authorization, which is truly in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the National Government.</p>
<h3>Regulations for Uniform Ship Registration Methods</h3>
<p>Petition submitted regarding a request. The association held its third members' general meeting on June 18th, according to a proposal from the Coal and Stone Barge Industry Association, requesting the government to clearly stipulate which agency should handle ship registration, in order to avoid double taxation and obstruction. It states that barges in this city are registered by the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and pay ship donations to the Finance Bureau on a monthly basis. Barges are divided into long-distance and short-distance barges. Long-distance barges specialize in transporting coal and stone in the Suzhou and Hangzhou areas, while short-distance barges only transfer goods in this port. When long-distance ships pass through various parts of Zhejiang Province, there is a Ship License Tax Bureau established by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Barges passing through must pay a monthly tax of 4.5 to 8 yuan. In addition, the Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau has established registration offices in various places, forcing civilian ships to register, collecting a registration fee of more than 30 yuan per ship. It can be seen that the burden on the shipping industry is heavier than other industries and will not be able to be sustained. In addition, the war has just ended, and there are many wounds to heal. How can we make up for them? If this continues, the shipping industry will not be able to bear it. The conference should quickly send a telegram to the government to determine the ship registration agency, and before collecting business tax, similar miscellaneous taxes and levies like likin should also be abolished to maintain people's livelihood. Whether it is appropriate, respectfully await public resolution, etc. The members' general meeting resolved to approve it and forward it to the government for review. The job of the Navigation Administration Bureau seems to be set up to take over the functions and powers of the Ship Measurement Office of the Customs. If it is said that ships registered with the Public Utilities Bureau should also be handled by the Bureau, the Ministry of Communications should consult with the Municipal Government to transfer the registration functions and powers of the Public Utilities Bureau to the Bureau and merge them into one place for handling. Otherwise, the Bureau will only take over the affairs under the jurisdiction of the Ship Measurement Office, and those handled by the Public Utilities Bureau will not be of concern to the Bureau. This is a fixed limit of authority for handling affairs. There is absolutely no reason to order separate registration and impose overlapping fees in the same place for the same matter, causing shipowners to be exhausted and impoverished, which is not suitable for the political system. Ten shepherds for nine sheep, what ancient philosophers deplored, especially since the purpose of setting up separate registration offices is only for the sake of collecting fees? No wonder the Association says that it is a miscellaneous tax and levy similar to likin. It is appropriate to record the case and submit it to your Yuan for review. Please stipulate a uniform method and order the Ministry of Communications and the Municipal Government to comply with it, in order to alleviate the unnecessary burden on shipowners, which is truly in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Request to Prohibit Surcharges on Passenger and Cargo Fares on Small Steamers</h3>
<p>Petition submitted regarding a request. The association held its third members' general meeting on June 18th, according to a proposal from the Inland Steamer Industry Association, requesting the Executive Yuan to clearly order governments at all levels in Zhejiang Province not to set up various pretexts to levy surcharges on passenger and cargo fares on steamers, in order to lighten the burden and emphasize the importance of laws. It states that Article 36 of the Provisional Constitution states, "The state should establish state-owned shipping and especially encourage and protect private shipping." Also, on February 13th of last year, the 10th meeting of the National Government resolved in the fourth item of the agenda, "Hereafter, all compulsory levies on the people by the central and local governments, regardless of whether they are called taxes, donations, fees, or other names, unless they arise from the enforcement of laws, their establishment and abolition should first be decided in principle by the Central Political Conference and the content should be examined by the Legislative Yuan before they can be established." The Provisional Constitution is the fundamental outline of the party and the state, and the National Government is the highest administrative organ of the central government. The glorious order should be regarded as the standard. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, in July of last year, wanted to levy a surcharge of 10% on passenger and cargo fares on steamers to fill the expenses of the West Zhejiang Water Conservancy Association because its funding was insufficient. This year, it is using the excuse of the national crisis and various expenses to add a 20% surcharge to passenger and cargo fares on steamers, calling it a special national crisis donation. Inland shipowners in our Zhejiang Province have made many appeals, and with the enthusiastic assistance of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the purpose of abolishing it was achieved. The Jiaxing County Government also wanted to imitate it and planned to levy an education surcharge on passenger and cargo fares on steamers in the four counties of Jiaxing, Pinghu, Haiyan, and Jiashan under its jurisdiction, and there was even a proposal for compulsory enforcement. Local education has special funds, how can it rely on surcharges from the shipping industry to supplement it? Moreover, education and steamer passengers are truly as unrelated as a horse and a cow. How can surcharges be collected? Steamer companies are not affiliated to government offices and are not responsible for collecting surcharges. If this can be done by adding surcharges, then other public welfare and charitable undertakings can also collect surcharges. If this continues, the surcharges will be higher than the steamer fares. Those directly affected are passengers, and the indirect impact is still on shipowners. The reason for this is that governments at all levels in Zhejiang Province disregard laws. The conference should resolve to petition the National Government and the Executive Yuan to clearly order governments at all levels in Zhejiang Province to respect laws and not to set up various pretexts to levy surcharges on passenger and cargo fares on steamers, in order to lighten the burden and emphasize the importance of laws, etc. The members' general meeting resolved to approve it and petition the Executive Yuan for review. Inland steamers use the transportation of passengers and cargo to charge fares as their business. The industry has already complied with regulations and paid business tax to Zhejiang Province. According to Article 9 of the Business Tax Law passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the government, and Article 13 of the Supplementary Measures to the Outline for the Collection of Business Tax in Various Provinces submitted by the Ministry of Finance and approved for promulgation by your Yuan, it is prohibited for provinces to levy additional taxes after levying business tax. Therefore, the proposal mentioned in the original proposal to levy a 10% surcharge on passenger and cargo fares by the West Zhejiang Water Conservancy Association and the plan to collect an education surcharge on passenger and cargo fares by the four counties of the former Jia Prefecture both violate the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government. It is appropriate to record the case and submit it to your Yuan for review. Please order the Zhejiang Provincial Government to investigate and stop it, in order to maintain laws and avoid harsh levies, which is truly in the public interest. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Rice Industry Association</h3>
<p>The United Association of Rice Industry Associations held a standing committee meeting yesterday at the Cui Xiu Restaurant. The committee members present were Zhang Jingzhai, Zhao Ziyu, Huang Qixiang, Zhao Ming, Chen Junyu, Zhu Zixiang, Zhang Gong, (Zhu Zixiang substituting), Cai Yukun, Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Zhuqing, Pang Baisen, Fu Yigeng, and Chen Zisheng, a total of fifteen people. Zhu Zixiang was publicly elected as chairman. The proceedings were as follows: (1) Report on the summary of income and expenditure accounts for the 20th year of the Republic; (2) Discussion on the Wuxi Rice and Bean Industry Association, that the county is promoting a new system of weights and measures, with a limited time for implementation, but there are still many obstacles. Please forward it to the Department of Construction to postpone the adoption. The resolution was to forward it as requested; (4) Discussion on the proposal by the Rice and Bean Industry Associations of Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai counties that the Jiangsu Provincial Government is levying a special business tax, which is actually a disguised likin by roadside bureaus, a matter of vital concern. A unified resistance should be launched to achieve the purpose of abolition. The resolution was that although this association is based on the rice industry, most of the rice merchants also operate in beans, wheat, and six grains, and some are mainly engaged in beans. This association should strive to resist it to relieve the suffering of Jiangsu merchants. It is proposed to proceed in three steps: 1. According to the original case of abolishing likin in the 17th year of the Republic, petition the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Department of Finance to appeal for orders; 2. Unite with industry associations in various counties throughout the province to organize a petitioning group to petition; 3. Painfully suspend business to express the determination to be unable to bear the burden. Also, Committee Member Chen Junzhi and Committee Member Huang Qixiang moved temporarily to check the income and expenditure report of the association. Under the heading of expenses, it is still economical and the membership fee should be reduced immediately to make it more universal. The resolution was that the membership fee is still divided into four types of collection: (A) type reduced to 200 yuan per year, (B) type 150 yuan per year, (C) type 100 yuan per year, (D) type 50 yuan per year. The original recognized old amount should be reduced separately to the 20th year of the Republic. The unpaid membership fee should also be collected according to the reduced amount.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Yixing County Reports Tragic Disaster</h3>
<p>The China Life Saving Society received a report from the Yixing County Magistrate and Water Disaster Relief Committee stating that Yixing suffered an unprecedented flood disaster last summer and autumn. Appeals were made to various parties to raise funds and donations, and winter and spring relief were distributed repeatedly. However, the disaster was severe and the funds were insufficient, making it difficult to provide universal relief. The disaster victims received relief grain and filled their stomachs with grass roots, tree bark, and soil commonly known as Guanyin powder. Some were even beaten to death for fighting over grass roots, and some died of abdominal distension from eating Guanyin powder. The tragic situation is beyond description. After entering summer, grass roots and tree bark were also eaten up. The disaster situation worsened day by day. It was hoped that the silkworm and wheat harvests could make up for it in some way, but from spring to summer, the weather was constantly changing, with irregular rainfall and sunshine. The silkworm and wheat harvests were less than one-tenth or two-tenths of the previous year. The price of top-quality cocoons was 30 yuan per stone, which was not enough to cover the cost of silkworm rearing. The harvest of two wheats was generally less than 30%. The unripe wheat ears in the heavily affected areas had long been cut and eaten by the disaster victims, and there was no harvest to speak of. After the great famine, followed by the silkworm famine, and after the silkworm famine, the wheat famine was added. The vitality was cut off. The tragedy of abandoning children and committing suicide as a family is unbearable to see and hear. People collapsed on the roads and died in the grass, one after another day and night. Those who died are gone, and those waiting to die are crying for help. According to investigations and statistics, at least 12,000 people are in need of relief to survive, with a ration of two yuan per person, which requires at least 30,000 yuan. Representatives were elected to plead with the National Government Relief Committee and Commissioner Cheng of the Jiangbei District Relief Affairs. It was said that there were no more funds to allocate. Continuing to raise funds locally, only the great famine and the Shanghai war had a double impact. All industries were withered, and public and private finances were extremely exhausted. The amount obtained was also small, a drop in the bucket, which was of no help. The great difficulty in the future will cut off the vitality. We have always admired your association's compassion and tireless charity. We respectfully send representatives to sincerely petition for the appropriation of huge funds to save the remaining lives of the disaster victims waiting to die, then we will be grateful and pray for blessings. The association was very saddened to hear of this tragic situation, but it was beyond its ability to help, only feeling like it was trying to cook without rice.</p>
<h3>The Second Batch of Overseas Chinese from Japan Return Home Today</h3>
<p>The overseas Chinese from Japan who landed at the Dalian Wharf have suffered greatly in Japan since the outbreak of the January 28th Incident. The Ministry of Communications consulted with the Dalian Company to transport the overseas Chinese back to China in batches. The first batch of more than 100 people had already returned to China on the Dalian Company's Wilson Wheel a few days ago. The second batch of returning overseas Chinese, about one hundred and several dozen people, also boarded the company's President Taft Wheel at Yokohama Port on the 24th to Shanghai, scheduled to arrive at this port tonight and dock at the Bailianjing Wharf in Pudong. At that time, the Navigation Administration Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau of this port will send personnel to take care of everything.</p>
<h3>Recent Actions of Foreign Warships Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>When the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident broke out, the Japanese military successively sent a large number of warships, as many as thirty or forty. The United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy also took the view that the war had begun and the situation was serious. In order to protect the safety of their overseas Chinese, they successively dispatched warships to increase their defenses. For a time, foreign warships gathered at the Huangpu and Songjiang Rivers, almost connecting end to end, with chimneys standing like forests. Now that the Japanese military is withdrawing successively and the situation is gradually stabilizing, the warships are also approaching the hot summer. In addition to the majority that have been summoned to countries abroad, some have also moved to Yantai, Qingdao, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou and other places to avoid the heat. Although the number of warships recently stationed in Shanghai is not very large, a large number are preparing to stay in Shanghai for the summer. The names of the warships are listed below: Japan "Tenryu" "Tokiwa" "Urakaze" "Peach" "Third Special Special Ship Muroto" "Fifteenth Destroyer" United States "Asheyitle" "Tutuila" "Rochester" United Kingdom "H.M.S. Devonshire" France "Croaune" "Primonguet" France "Camotto" "Espero" Also, it is reported that the US government, during the intense fighting in the Shanghai war, had transferred the Thirty-First Army stationed in Manila to Shanghai for defense. Now that the situation has stabilized, it is no longer necessary for the troops to remain stationed. It is heard that they are scheduled to return to their original defense in Manila on July 1st. They have been packing their luggage in recent days, preparing to depart.</p>

<h3>Change of Warden of the Second Prison</h3>
<p>Dong Jimin, the warden of the Jiangsu Second Prison in Caohejing, has been transferred from his post in Nantong to fill the vacancy for nearly two years. Even during the period of shortage of funds and heavy debts, Warden Dong has tried every means to plan and revive the workshop and rectify the prison, so that the more than 1,900 prisoners in the prison have no worries about freezing and starvation, and all have the opportunity to repent. It was said that it was rising steadily, but after the January 28th Incident, there were no funds and the workshop was shut down. How could the daily prisoner food be reduced? For this reason, debts were owed, and various transactions amounted to tens of thousands of yuan. Exhausted, he submitted a request to the High Court to resign. The resignation was earnest and has been approved. Tian Lixun, a Hunan native, has now been appointed to take over, and is scheduled to take over at the beginning of next month. Warden Dong has ordered various departments to prepare for the handover.</p>
<h3>Opening of the New Headquarters of the Customs Foreign Staff Chinese Club</h3>
<p>The Customs Foreign Staff Chinese Club has been established for five years. The department has made many achievements in improving the treatment of Chinese staff in foreign classes.

<h3>Young Man in Suit Commits Suicide in Hotel</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (24th) evening, a young man dressed in a suit resembling a student, speaking with a Shandong accent, went alone to the Dahua Hotel at No. 85 Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession and checked in, claiming his name was Wang Baohe, 27 years old. He was led upstairs by the waiter and opened room 19 to sleep. He got up at noon the next day and ordered the waiter to call for a plate of fried noodles to fill his stomach. After the fried noodles were delivered, he closed the door again. The waiter thought he was sleeping and did not suspect any change. However, Wang, for some reason, suddenly had a short-sighted idea, untied the silk trousers belt from his body, and hanged himself on the bed frame. It was not until 2:30 PM that the noodle shop staff went to collect the bowl and knocked on the door, but there was no response. After the waiter Yu Xiaofu knew that something was wrong, he pried open the door and entered. Wang was already dead, and the plate of fried noodles he had called for was still on the table, untouched. The hotel immediately reported to the police, who sent detectives to investigate. The deceased had no belongings, only a few copper coins on his body. The body was carried to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for a post-mortem examination. No relatives of the deceased were found. Today, a report was made to the Second Special Zone Court to send personnel for examination.</p>
<h3>Sheng Amei's Boat Capsized and People Died</h3>
<p>Boatman Sheng Amei specializes in transporting goods such as oil cakes and grains to various ports in the interior. Recently, a merchant from Linghu purchased 100 pieces of Dalian soybean oil and 130 packages of soybeans from Xiangxu Sheng Co., and Xiangxu Sheng Co. hired Sheng to transport them. After Sheng's boat was loaded with goods, due to unfavorable winds, he hired Qiaoxing Small Wheel to tow it to Shitang. The wheel towed Sheng's boat to the Shitang area. Sheng untied the tow rope to shake it himself. As soon as the rope was untied, a small wheel came rushing in, and the waves rushed in. Sheng's boat was hit by the waves of two wheels and could not support it. Suddenly, the entire boat was submerged and capsized. Sheng and four partners fell into the water. The boatmen went forward to rescue them and rescued Sheng and three partners. One partner was missing. After Sheng was rescued, he was extremely alarmed because the boat sank and the goods were lost. He was afraid that the owner of the goods would claim compensation for the goods and he would not be able to pay. He went to Linghu to report to the merchants who purchased the goods, and then Sheng ran to Linghukou, threw himself into the river, and died. After the merchant telegraphed Xiangxu Sheng Co., he hired a boat to go to Shitang to salvage the sunken boat and goods, and to investigate the situation of the boat's disaster and Sheng's death. Sheng's wife learned of this and went to Linghu to collect the body. The coffin has not yet been transported back. Sheng's wife came to Shanghai yesterday, saying that her husband was forced to throw himself into the river by the merchant, and demanded that the company negotiate with the merchant to compensate and comfort him, and asked a lawyer to send a letter to negotiate.</p>
<h3>Case of Assassination of the Criminal Affairs Chief of the Garrison Department</h3>
<p>Trial Moved from Nanjing to Shanghai</p>
<p>Widow of the Deceased Weeps</p>
<p>Ling Runxiang, a Cantonese and Criminal Affairs Chief of Area C of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, was fatally shot by an assailant on the evening of July 28th of the year before last, around 10 PM, at the entrance of Dexing Lane on North Zhejiang Road. Subsequently, Feng Shuofu, a Cantonese detective of the Hongkou Police Station, along with detective He Renrui, arrested three Cantonese accomplices in the case, namely Lu Ju, Feng Cai, and Dian Yang, and handed them over to the court for interrogation. They were each sentenced to imprisonment. On the evening of August 4th, around 11 PM, the Municipal Public Security Bureau apprehended five more accomplices, namely Qu Zhaocheng, Liu Xizhuang, Luo Baoliang, Qu Chang, and Qu Chuntong, all Cantonese, at the Guangwutai Theater on Qiujiang Road. They were handed over to the Garrison Headquarters, which sentenced Qu Zhaocheng to life imprisonment, and the remaining, including Liu Xizhuang, to ten years each. They were transferred to Suzhou officials for forwarding to the capital for execution. Subsequently, the families of the defendants, dissatisfied, requested an investigation by the Ministry of Military Affairs, which was handed over to the Jiangning Local Court for trial. The court intended to revoke the previous judgment, as Lu Ju and others were apprehended within the Shanghai International Settlement, and the incident also occurred within the Settlement. The defendants were transported to Shanghai on the 7th of this month by judicial police and taken to the Hongkou Police Station. The following morning, they were handed over to the First Special District Local Court for custody. The other day, Judge Qiao Wanxuan came to High Court One for interrogation, and the police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, detailed the previous circumstances. He stated that the murderer of Ling Runxiang was named Hu Ying, and the defendants were instigators. Before the incident, the defendants raised funds for Hu Ying to carry out the act. The confirmed confession of Lu Ju stated that on July 15th before the incident, the defendants Qu Zhaocheng, Liu Xizhuang, and Qu Chang, among others, gathered at the Sanyuan Temple on Wuchang Road to discuss the plan to kill Ling, because a certain gambling den in the French Concession did not allow them to collect fees, leading to a grudge. They then swore an oath by slaughtering a chicken and drawing blood, pledging to deal with anyone who leaked the secret in the same manner. In May before the incident, Liu Xizhuang, Qu Chang, Qu Chuntong, and others met at the Cantonese Merchant Restaurant on North Sichuan Road and collected 400 yuan, which was handed over to Hu Ying as the fee for killing Ling. This was borrowed from Mo Yang, who had been dealing in this business for three years, but Mo is now deceased. Qu Zhaocheng also contributed a substantial amount to the funds. When Mo appealed to the High Court, he also had this confession. Now, the two defendants, Lu Ju and Feng Cai, are also being brought up, fearing they will not testify. Ling's wife also appeared in court. The defendants were all acquainted with Ling in the past. Before the incident, Ling worked at the Public Security Bureau, arresting communists, and Qu Zhaocheng, Liu Xizhuang, and a Mr. Zhang were among them. Someone had informed Ling that Qu Zhaocheng wanted to have him assassinated by a friend. Ling's wife had also stated this during Lu Ju's appeal. Defendant Luo Baoliang also had a confession recorded when he was sentenced to ten years by the Garrison Headquarters, and it is requested that this be examined during the rescheduling. According to the statement of Ling's wife, Zhang, age 36, also Cantonese, residing in Dexing Lane on North Jiangxi Road, on the third day of the sixth lunar month (July 28th in the Gregorian calendar) of the year before last, around 10 PM, she went out with her husband. Just as they reached the entrance of the lane and were about to hire a rickshaw, they suddenly heard a gunshot. Her husband was hit by the bullet and fell to the ground. She tried to chase after the murderer, but there were many people in the lane at the time, and she could not see clearly. Later, after the police arrested Lu Ju, she learned that the murderer was Hu Ying. Defendant Qu Zhaocheng had visited her house seven days before the incident regarding a matter for a certain company in the French Concession. Qu Chang and Qu Chuntong also frequented Dexing Lane and were acquainted with it. She did not know Liu Xizhuang and Luo Baoliang. Her husband had no prior disputes with the defendants. She did not know the reason for his murder. However, when her husband was a detective at the Hongkou Police Station, he wanted to arrest Qu Zhaocheng's younger brother. Mo Yang and others confessed at the Public Security Bureau that they had sworn an oath by slaughtering a chicken, and Qu Zhaocheng provided the funds, instructing Hu Ying to kill her husband. Therefore, she requested the court to seek redress for her grievances. After speaking, tears streamed down her face. According to the testimony of Lu Ju and Feng Cai, they did not know the defendants. They were wrongly prosecuted and could not remember their previous confessions. The interrogation continued until after noon. Judge Qiao instructed the defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<h3>Case of Fratricide in Pudong over Property Dispute</h3>
<p>Scheduled for Debate. Zhang Qingxiang, the third son of the late Zhang Linsen of Huayuan Stone Bridge in Pudong, and his concubine Zhang Zhang (i.e., Qingxiang's mother), had a property dispute with his eldest brother Guo Xiang and second brother Yu Xiang. On November 1st of last year, Qingxiang and his maternal uncle Zhang Quansheng used firearms to kill Yu Xiang, while Guo Xiang was injured but did not die. After the incident, the Third District Police Station detained Qingxiang, Quansheng, and Zhang Zhang and handed them over to the local court. A burned pistol belonging to Zhang Quansheng was found in the stove, and they were immediately prosecuted. Criminal Court Judge Shen Youqi, not weary of seeking details, has summoned witnesses for investigation several times. Yesterday afternoon, he summoned Bao Zhongxian for questioning. Bao is the brother-in-law of Zhang Yuxiang. After Zhang Yuxiang and his brother Guo Xiang were injured, Yuxiang was sent to Renji Hospital. He and two policemen went to Renji Hospital, but Yuxiang had already died. His sister went to the police station. He and the police went to Baolong Hospital to see Guo Xiang, who said that the perpetrator was Qingxiang, instigated by the concubine (i.e., Zhang Zhang), who should be detained. They then went to Renji Hospital, where his sister had already accompanied the corpse home. Zhang Quansheng traded his pistol with Yang Fulin, and Zhu Shangzhi knew everything. Zhang Guo Xiang testified that when he and Yu Xiang were returning, they saw three people coming towards them in the dark. When he looked, one person was already in front of him, whom he recognized as Qingxiang. The gun in his hand was fired at his neck. He immediately fled after being hit, so one of the two behind seemed to be Zhang Quansheng, and Yu Xiang, stepping forward, was also killed. Zhang Quansheng's wife, Zhang Shen, during the last court hearing, hid the gun in the stove because her husband was arrested, fearing implication, and fled to escape. Zhang Quansheng intentionally exchanged a light pistol with Yang Fulin, as testified by Yang. Therefore, it is very clear that if this person comes out in the future, they will still be in danger, and they request that he be severely punished within the possible range. Yang Fulin testified that he did not know Zhang Guo Xiang. Yan Xinglin was his wife's uncle. Zhang Quansheng came to his house to exchange guns on August 11th, exchanging with his father. His father died in mid-September. Yan Xinglin testified that he lived in Yangshupu and that his ancestral home was You Tang in Tangqiao, Pudong, where he was a machine maker. Zhang Quansheng was a friend, and Yang Fulin was his brother-in-law. One Monday, around the 2nd or 3rd, he went to Pudong to help Zhang Quansheng with a boundary dispute with his neighbors. Later, he ate dinner at his house until 7:30, when his brother's son Lin came to call him, instructing him to go to Yangshupu early the next morning. His brother also drank wine that night but did not eat. At this point, the official said that the time was late and there was not enough time for debate, instructing them to wait for the scheduled start of the debate, and then adjourned the court, and the defendants were remanded in custody. When this case was opened for trial, Pudong people crowded the audience, which showed the people's attention.</p>

<h3>Gong Chunsheng Accused of Abandonment by Wife</h3>
<p>Spouses May Not Sue; Rejection. Gong Chunsheng, from Ningbo, married Ms. Xu in the autumn of the tenth year of the Republic of China, over ten years ago. They have a son named Guan Bao, who is eight years old. Last year, Gong also took Chen Meihong as a concubine and abandoned his first wife. Therefore, Ms. Xu, along with her son, filed a criminal complaint of abandonment against Gong in the First Special District Local Court. The original complaint stated that the plaintiff and defendant were married on August 6th of the tenth year of the Republic of China in the Ningbo Fellow Villagers' Hall in Shanghai and have lived together as husband and wife ever since, for more than ten years, and have a son named Guan Bao. Daily expenses have always been provided by the defendant on a monthly basis. However, in May of last year, the defendant suddenly took a concubine and has since been abandoned. Despite repeated negotiations, not only did she not receive any assistance, but she was repeatedly beaten. On April 29th of this year, the defendant even dared to attack her with a knife, and it was only through the persuasion of neighbors that she escaped harm. Therefore, although the plaintiff is nominally a married woman with a son who has a father, her plight is even worse than that of orphans and widows. A single person and a young child are alone and destitute, without the means to make a living and in a state of helplessness, with no way to survive and no way to die. Therefore, the defendant has committed the crime under Article 210 of the Criminal Code. According to Article 5 of the New Agreement of the Shanghai International Settlement, this case can be brought as a private prosecution. Therefore, she specially requests that the defendant be summoned to court for legal investigation and that the defendant be ordered to pay a one-time living expense of 13,800 yuan and an educational and marriage expense of 10,000 yuan for Guan Bao. The other day, Judge Qiao Wanxuan of the court summoned the defendant Gong Chunsheng, but he did not appear. His lawyer was postponed and claimed that the defendant was a groom at the racecourse and could not appear because the races were being held today. However, according to Article 139 of the Criminal Procedure Law, spouses may not sue. The plaintiff's complaint is illegal and should be rejected. Judge Qiao then questioned and learned that Gong Xu and the plaintiff were officially married and met the conditions under which spouses may not sue. The case was ruled inadmissible. The claim for alimony is a civil matter and the plaintiff was ordered to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court separately.</p>

<h3>Murderer in Gambling Den Case Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Taishan, a Chinese constable of the French Concession Beidang Road police station, went to the Great World for amusement with his colleagues Xu Lijin, Hong Jiacan, and Peng Chaoshan, and others on the evening of September 11 of last year. Around 11:00 PM, they went out and, when they arrived at Baoyu Nongkou, they saw ruffians Gao Xiaoyun and Xu Xiaosanzi and others setting up a gambling den there. Chen Taishan immediately stepped forward to gamble, leading to a conflict and mutual fighting. At that time, after a commotion, everyone dispersed. After the capture went home, Chen felt a stomach ache. He went to the hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died. Afterwards, the family of the deceased Chen accused Yang Wende, Chinese constable number 450 of the Da Zimin Bell police station, and Wu Yuanyi, Chinese constable number 503, of releasing the murderers, allowing them to escape, and brought the matter to the Second Special District Court for trial. Due to insufficient evidence, the case was rejected. The family of the deceased, dissatisfied, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After investigation, the appeal was dismissed. Until now, the murderers Gao Xiaoyun and Xu Xiaowangzi were arrested by French police detective Su Deshan and Qin Youyu, and sent to the Second Special District Court. First, police lawyer Fei Chenshu narrated the case, and then the deceased's father, Chen Jintong, appealed that his son was brutally beaten to death and requested redress. The witnesses Xu Lijin and Hong Jiacan and others also came to court to testify about the fighting at the time. The two defendants denied that they were the murderers at the time, because the time had passed for so long that it could not be proved. When asked, Gao and Xu both confessed that although they and Wang Asan, who was at large, had jointly set up a gambling den, they did not commit murder. They asked for investigation. Judge Xiong Huiping verified the confession and ordered a retrial at a later date, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

After taking the loot, the bandits left and fled.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Federation's 14th Branch Opposes Telephone Price Increase</h3>
<p>Sends Letter to Public Works Department Requesting Reconsideration. The 14th Branch of the Shanghai Federation, based on the resolution of the seventh executive meeting yesterday, expressed its opposition to the telephone price increase in the concession. The original letter read, "To the Shanghai Municipal Council: Your department's rash approval of the new price increase regulations of the concession telephone company shows disregard for the suffering of the citizens. The company's business situation shows that its annual profits are already substantial. This time, the authorities in the neutral zone of the Public Concession abandoned their obligation to protect the safety of citizens and facilitated the Japanese military action on January 28th, causing unprecedented chaos in Shanghai. Commerce is in decline, finance is stagnant, and the local economy is in recession. Regardless of where the responsibility lies for the direct and indirect damage suffered by all citizens of the city, your department, without considering the situation, rashly approved the company's new price increase regulations in the autumn when the market has not recovered after the war, increasing the burden on citizens. In terms of sentiment and reason, it is truly inappropriate. At the seventh executive meeting on June 22nd, the association resolved to express its opposition. Therefore, we record and report this, and request that you convene a meeting of Chinese and foreign council members to reconsider the matter, carefully consider it, and cancel the new price increase regulations in order to alleviate the burden on citizens. We hope that your department will always care for the citizens in this way, and constantly protect them, so that the prosperity before the war can be restored. We hope you will consider the gains and losses. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession."</p>

<h3>Girl Crushed to Death by Bus: Investigation</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, the driver of bus number 15028, Li Yunlong, was driving from south to north on Dixiwei Road at high speed. Near Tiantong Road, a girl named Li Genying, just seven years old, was trying to cross the road from west to east. When she reached the middle of the road, the bus was already close to her and could not avoid her, knocking her down, crushing her head, and causing her brains to flow out. The blood flowed like a spring, a tragic sight that was unbearable to see. A Chinese constable on guard duty, number 1874, saw it and immediately recorded the bus number and took the driver Li Yunlong to the Jiading Road police station. The body of the girl Li was carried to the Ferran Road autopsy station. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court sent prosecutor Guo Wei to the station to examine the body. According to Li Yunlong's confession, he had been a driver for the company for four years. He was driving through the area at a normal speed when the girl suddenly ran across the road, and he immediately braked, but it was too late to prevent the accident. According to the witness Wu Shihao, he was also crossing the road at that time, and the child was behind him. The bus was far away at the time, and he did not hear the sound of the horn. According to the deceased's father, Li Awu, he was not at home at the time and did not know the details. After receiving the confessions, Mr. Guo ordered that the body of the deceased girl Li Genying be examined, and that it was confirmed that she had been crushed to death by bus number 15028 while alive.

<h3>Salt Boat Crew Fooling Around Leads to Death in Liuhe</h3>
<p>In Liuhe Town, Taicang County, which is directly accessible by the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus, there are two salt stacks at the eastern market, one being the Zhang Yuantai Salt Stack and the other being the Wushu Public Stack. Because the salt is plentiful, it is piled up like a mountain, so it is commonly called Salt Mountain. Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, a Ningbo salt boat was loading salt at the salt mountain. A group of crew members, sweating and thirsty, went to the stern of the boat to drink tea. Another crew member, A, saw them drinking tea without bowls or cups, leading to a playful teasing. A took a kitchen knife and jokingly said he would kill them. The tea-drinking crew members, thinking it was just playful teasing, were not afraid and stuck their necks out. Unexpectedly, the blade hit the throat, and blood immediately flowed like a fountain. The throat had been cut, and the injured person held his throat with his hand, hurried ashore, intending to go to the hospital for treatment. However, as soon as he landed, he fell to the ground and died. The town's Public Security Bureau was informed, and sent police to investigate. It was learned that there were six crew members on the boat, and no one admitted to accidentally killing the deceased, so they were all taken to the bureau and then escorted to the Taicang County Government for questioning.</p>

<p>Letters</p>
<p>To the Editor: We recently saw in your newspaper (June 26th, page 4), under the local news section, an item titled "Suspicious Hanging Corpse," which stated that a man was found hanging from a tree in a wasteland near Donggou River in Pudong. After investigation by Wang Chongshan, head of the Fifth Precinct of the Third District, it was reported that the townspeople claimed the deceased was a worker from the Donggou Match Factory from Shaoxing. Upon inquiry with the match factory, they absolutely denied having such a worker, thus making it a suspicious case, and the townspeople of Donggou were abuzz with speculation. It is true that on the 24th, when the Fifth Precinct of the Third District discovered the aforementioned death case, they did send a patrol officer to the factory to invite someone to come and identify whether the deceased was a worker from the factory. At that time, I was sent to go, and upon seeing the deceased's face, I confirmed that he was not a worker from our factory. Therefore, I explained this and returned. Now, upon seeing the four words "absolutely denied" in your newspaper, I fear that the ambiguous wording may confuse readers. I am writing to request a correction to clarify the facts. I hope you will publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Sincerely, Donggou Splint Factory of the Da Zhong Hua Match Company, June 26th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the article "Coveting a Young Woman, Offering Money for Medical Treatment" published in today's local news section of your newspaper, which is contrary to the facts. Upon investigation, the person involved, Ren Shouting, was engaged to Li Meilan two years ago through a matchmaker. Not only did both parties agree, but there was also a betrothal note from Li's father, Yaogen, also known as Yaogeng, as well as other material evidence that can be relied upon and witnesses who can be questioned. Later, as the wedding date approached, the Li family disappeared without a trace. In the middle of this month, Shouting found Meilan and her cohabitant, Feng Shouzhi, who falsely accused Shouting of extortion and reported him to the police station for infringing on their freedom. I, the undersigned lawyer, have already been entrusted to file a lawsuit with the court. Yesterday, Shouting reported to the police and arrested Li Yaogeng for investigation, which is not, as your newspaper reported, because Shouting was entangled in the matter and was taken to the police station together. There are records at the Public Security Bureau to prove this. This matter concerns the reputation of the person involved and has a significant impact on the progress of the case. Accordingly, I am writing to request that your newspaper publish this letter to make a correction. To the Editor of the Shen Bao Editorial Department, Lawyer Tang Tiantao, June 26th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I have read the news item "Jianghai Customs Patrol Boat Haixing Worker He Chun Falls into the Water and Drowns While Unloading Goods" in the shipping news column on the fourth page of today's newspaper, which contains some inaccuracies. I am writing to request a correction as follows: The Jianghai Customs patrol boat Liuxing was transporting grain from Sheshan back to Shanghai and docked at the Lujiazui pontoon on the 23rd at 9:00 AM. A crew member named He Chun (style name Peiqing, from Shipu, Xiangshan) was washing the ship's side when the sling of the hanging plank broke, causing him to fall into the river and drown. Although his shipmates tried their best to rescue him, He Chun was not good at swimming and sank without a trace. His body was recovered by the rescue bureau at Shihui Port yesterday (the 25th) and has been identified by his family for proper burial. Please make the necessary correction. Sincerely, He Hexiao, June 26th.</p>

<p>Quotations from the 93-year-old Ma Xiangbo</p>
<h3>Scientific Jokes</h3>
<p>— Mei Yi</p>
<p>Let me tell you a few scientific jokes. In the past, people studied why the sun emits light, and the result of their research was that there was a lodestone in the sun, which is why it could emit light. The evidence was that when iron is burned red, the light emitted can be used to take pictures in a dark room as a substitute for sunlight, which is very funny.</p>
<p>There is an even funnier story. In ancient Western times, before chemistry was well-developed, there was something called alchemy, which was similar to the Chinese art of turning yellow and white metals into gold and silver. The ancients wanted to get rich, thinking that yellow was gold and white was silver, so they indulged in fantasies and tried to find gold in yellow things every day. One person even had a whimsical idea: he accumulated sediment from human urine. Over time, he accumulated a thin piece that was surprisingly yellowish-brown in color. He was overjoyed, suspecting it contained gold. Fearing it would melt, he immersed it in oil, preparing to preserve it forever. Unexpectedly, the yellow thing emitted firefly-like light when immersed in oil, and he couldn't help but marvel in amazement.</p>
<p>Another person also had a whimsical idea: he wanted to find yellow crystals in human feces, and then pan out gold from the yellow crystals. He actually obtained a thin piece, which, when connected to an iron pipe, would emit fire.</p>
<p>The urine alchemist and the feces alchemist were at a loss, looking at each other in silence. No one knew what was going on! In fact, what they had concocted was not the gold they had been thinking about, but an unexpected phosphorus stone.</p>
<p>The beginning of science often starts with mystery and curiosity, and many scientific discoveries are accidentally obtained by unexpected ideas. This is a very interesting example.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Notes for the Berlin Chinese Art Exhibition (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bai Shi</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan of the National Government passed a resolution regarding the Chinese Art Exhibition:</p>
<p>The Chinese Art Exhibition will be held in Berlin in 1934, with a proposed preparatory fund of 30,000 marks. Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education, Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, Li Shizeng, President of the Peking Research Institute, Liu Wendao, Ambassador to Germany, Chen Shuren, Ye Gongchuo, Liu Haisu, Gao Qifeng, and Xu Beihong were appointed as members of the preparatory committee.</p>
<p>The independent exhibition of modern art works in Europe is truly an unprecedented event in our country's cultural undertakings. In recent times, the centers of European art have been Paris, the capital of France, and Berlin, the capital of Germany. The German and French people have always valued art, and the government's advocacy has been very strong. Both places have national academies of fine arts and art schools. Every spring and autumn, thousands of paintings and sculptures are collected from the country for public exhibition. The dissemination of aesthetic education is as rapid as wind and electricity. In addition, artists from various countries gather there, and in addition to honing their skills and appreciating art, they have strong organizational bodies to complete their art. Other governments also spend huge sums of money annually to hold art exhibitions in these two places for the sake of international culture, with the aim of promoting their country's art. And those who want to see the civilization of a country always go to these two places to see the rise and fall of its art as a measure. Japan, a small country, inherited the transmission of our country's art from afar and absorbed the trends of Europe and the West in recent times. Although its artistic achievements are somewhat admirable, they cannot be compared in terms of breadth and depth. Only with the power of the government, sparing no expense, special commissioners are selected to handle publicity. In the spring of 1929 in Paris, in the spring of 1930 in Rome, and in the spring of last year in Berlin, large-scale exhibitions of Japanese current art were held. Newspapers published extensive coverage, attracting the attention of Europeans. Now that our country can select modern masterpieces for exhibition in Germany, it will not only allow Japan to monopolize the field, but also allow Europeans to broaden their short-sighted view that there are no talents in China.</p>
<h3>The Lonely Courtyard</h3>
<p>— Yingge</p>
<p>｜Miscellaneous Writings of the Old Capital - 10｜</p>
<p>I moved several times, but finally lived the longest in a courtyard with locust trees. The composition of this courtyard is the same as that of ordinary courtyards in Beijing. I chose a south-facing main room. The room was wallpapered with white paper, which was not luxurious but clean and tidy. The surroundings were also very quiet, so the restless heart of a traveler, which is prone to stimulation, was able to settle down comfortably. What made me most happy was that every morning, when the sparrows sang to the sun, the shadows of locust branches would move on the south-facing paper window. The lush leaves and swaying branches naturally formed patterns on the window, which were better than any painting. I would watch it while lying in bed until lunchtime, when its shadow would move from my window to the moss-covered steps in front of the door, and then to the opposite wall. From this, I seemed to hear the footsteps of time passing, so I marveled. I marveled that the pen of time had already drawn a fine mustache on my mouth.</p>
<p>The courtyard's owner didn't have any young children. Their one daughter was already over ten years old and attending school. I didn't often sleep during the day, and the surroundings were so quiet that there was no sound at all. This, of course, could sometimes help your writing, but sometimes you would be thrown into a situation of ridiculous loneliness by this deathly silence. One day, I was lamenting the desolation of my own life when I suddenly heard a burst of fierce quarreling from the neighboring courtyard, breaking through the siege of deathly silence. Listening carefully, I recognized a rough and indignant voice as that of a man, and a sharp, tearful voice as that of a woman. They were arguing, sentence by sentence. Later, the sound of flesh hitting flesh was sent into my ears like a string of beads, and the woman's cries pierced my heart with startling intensity. I was pained to be separated by a wall; otherwise, I would have really wanted to advise them to be more peaceful. But the sounds from across the wall were especially chaotic and loud, and it seemed that the woman was about to commit suicide. My sensitive heart couldn't help but throb, and I was seriously worried about the outcome of this live drama.</p>
<p>I didn't feel lonely, and I didn't know where it was? I asked people, "What's going on?" But the courtyard owner told me calmly: "The little couple in the north 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 will be fine tonight, Mr. Zhou, don't be afraid."</p>
<h3>World News in Brief</h3>
<p>— Haike</p>
<p>Paris, the capital of France, is the birthplace of trendy fashion. Women's decorations are changing with each passing day. In general, fashionable women have recently created new styles in their hair and hats. The way hair is cut, curled, and permed must be coordinated with the hat.</p>
<p>Table tennis (also known as ping-pong) is popular in Japan. There are 200,000 men and women who love to play table tennis. There are more than 40 magazines and reports published specifically for research.</p>
<p>In several villages in England, various old and strange treatments are still popular. One example is a type of roasted coal tea. A hot, bright red piece of roasted coal is thrown into a cup of hot water and given to children to drink to treat their stomach ailments.</p>
<p>The country with the most telephones in the world was originally the United States. However, in 1931, due to the impact of the global economic downturn, the number of users suddenly decreased by 500,000. Now, the United Kingdom is considered the leader. Last year alone, the number of new users added was 85,000.</p>
<h3>Zhang Daqian Discusses Copying Ancient Paintings</h3>
<p>— Weizhai</p>
<p>Layman Daqian is famous for imitating Shi Tao's paintings. South from the source of the Yangtze River all the way to the sea, north to Mount Tai all the way to Changbai and Kunlun, east to Japan and Korea, he bought all the artworks of artists. Among the officials, wealthy merchants, and families that collect antiques, whoever gets a slightly fine paper copy of Shi Tao's paintings will sigh in wonder and doubt, saying, "Could this be made by Daqian?" However, Shi Tao's works created by Daqian have already filled the universe, confusing heroes at home and abroad. Daqian imitated Shi Tao not only in the appearance of brushstrokes, but also in the spirit and organization. Therefore, they are different from those created by others. Moreover, Shi Tao's paintings may have been created hastily and not perfectly, but Daqian's imitations are always concentrated and meticulous, with no regrets. Therefore, Daqian's creation of Shi Tao is almost more faithful than Shi Tao's own creation. As a result, it is even more difficult for the world to distinguish Shi Tao's paintings, and beauty and ugliness are no longer the sole criteria. However, Daqian's skills are not limited to Shi Tao. He also likes to imitate Bada Shanren, Tianchi, Bai Yang, and the great masters of the Huangshan School of landscape painting. Even a casual imitation is enough to make those who appreciate it lose their sense of beauty. Imitating the authenticity is a clever trick of the literati, and friends can talk and laugh, which is only for temporary pleasure, and is not enough to be a lesson. However, learning to paint must first start with copying the ancients, and copying the ancients must strive for vividness and lifelikeness, so that it can be confused with the real thing. This is indeed a path that scholars must take, and it must not be neglected. Much of the scholarship in our country involves returning to the ancients, and this is not limited to art. The Analects of Confucius says, "Review the old and know the new." The Book of Rites says, "Must follow the ancient ways." Ziyun, a teacher of classics, actually imitated the Book of Changes in writing the Supreme Mystery. Liu Xin, a great Confucian, falsely created the ancient text of the Book of Documents. In the poetry of the Wei and Jin Dynasties, imitations of ancient styles were listed first. In the calligraphy of the Three Tang Dynasties, there was the practice of rubbing and copying. It is necessary to be able to know the ancients before one can speak of understanding the present, and to know imitation before one can speak of creation. Hasty negligence will lead to skipping steps, which must be understood. In recent years, Daqian has traveled extensively through the mountains and rivers of the north and south, especially indulging in the Diamond Mountains of Korea and the Yellow Mountains of Shexian County, absorbing the clouds and mist and observing the creation of nature. Suddenly, he became tired of imitating the ancients and will return to nature. In terms of the artistic process, Daqian's paintings are sufficient to be independent without relying on others. Therefore, Daqian examined more than a hundred of his old imitations of ancient landscapes, figures, ladies, and flowers, and will destroy them all by burning them. He told his friends, "My paintings will die from yesterday." His peers congratulated him on his paintings, which will create a new style and become a great achievement, and also regretted that his old works took great pains, exhausted his energy, and spent more than ten years of effort, and could not bear to discard them completely. They wanted to ask him to put them on display to make more connections with ink. For Daqian, it is possible to show people his playful side and tell them the path that calligraphy and painting must take. For young people with aspirations, they can use Daqian's ladder to look up to the halls of Shi Tao and Bada. All in all, one move can achieve several good things. However, Daqian has not yet agreed to this. I am writing this article to encourage those who love Daqian's paintings in Shanghai to make this happen, to preserve this wonderful ink in the world, and to release a ray of light in the literary and artistic circles after the war. If the exhibition is successfully opened in the future, then I will humbly compare myself to the one who carries the arrowhead and leads the way.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Qingdao (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Fog: The "Mingsheng" steamer we were on from Shanghai to Qingdao suddenly stopped in the sea after two days and three nights. According to the passengers who were experienced in traveling, Qingdao had arrived. But because of the fog, we had to wait. I mingled with the crowd, leaning on the ship's railing and looking out, but I could only see a white expanse around me, and nothing could be seen. Ah, the heavy fog of Qingdao.</p>
<p>After a while, the fog thinned out a bit. Ah, isn't that stretch of blue waves, green mountains, green forests, and red tiles the beautiful Qingdao we have been looking forward to day and night? Looking out from the half-lit mist, it really looks like a delicate fairy mountain floating on the blue sea. I had only vaguely experienced this beautiful scenery in the imaginative words of poets before. But thanks to the fog, such an ethereal fairy scene was conjured up.</p>
<p>Later, I read the "Gazetteer of Jiaozhou Bay" and learned that Qingdao "from April to the end of July, there is often one or several thick fogs per week, coming from the sea..." People who live here say that Qingdao's fog will fly in from the windows in gusts, making the air humid and the clothes moldy. I stayed in Qingdao for half a month this time, but I didn't encounter such a heavy fog. However, one morning I saw gusts of white fog falling from the sky and spreading everywhere. And when I looked out the window at dusk, I saw that the huge gate lamp that had originally stood there had disappeared in outline, and only a pale red halo was floating in the white expanse, seemingly telling people that it had not been completely obscured by the fog.</p>
<p>Bloodstains that Make You Shudder: On Sunday, I accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Zhang to visit the ruins of the "Huiquan Cape" fort. This fort was built by the Germans when they occupied Qingdao. It was vast and well-equipped. There were two 24-centimeter cannons and three 15-centimeter cannons on the platform, all of which could be rotated. When Qingdao was handed over, important parts were either stolen or the cannon barrels were blown up, becoming a fort that only offered the outer wall to later generations for remembrance. The wall was built with piled stones, in which a chamber more than a mile long was opened. In the chamber were ammunition depots, wounded soldier rooms, bedrooms (there were still hammocks hanging there), bullet lifts, and kitchens (there was still ash left by German soldiers in the iron pots).</p>
<h3>Records of a Military and Literary Life (91)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Hall Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Admiring the Provincial Governor's Flag in a Small, Remote Town; Obsequious Crowds Follow the Attendants</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Qin subconsciously clasped his fist and raised his arms high in salute, accidentally bumping his forehead first. This jarringly cleared his muddled brain. He immediately bent low, bowing deeply to the ground. With a series of trembles in his voice, he said, "Commander, you have honored our humble establishment with your presence from afar. This small shop should certainly welcome you. Please forgive any shortcomings and do us the honor of entering and taking a seat." Master Wu also helped by saying, "His surname is Qin, and he is the shopkeeper here. I often patronize his business. Unfortunately, in our small place, there are no good hotels to be found. Only his place is勉强 passable. I hope the Commander will bear with the situation." Commander An nodded, about to step forward, when another distinguished guest stepped down from the second mule cart and came to Commander An's side. Master Wu hurriedly told Shopkeeper Qin, "This is Advisor Hu from the Provincial Office. He came with Commander An. They are all here on urgent official business and will need to stay here for some time. Including myself, there are eight or nine people in their party. Quickly prepare spacious and clean rooms." Shopkeeper Qin quickly bowed again, repeatedly saying "Yes, yes," and led the way, guiding the group of people to a large hall in the back of the inn. He loudly called for the servants to bring water for washing faces and to brew tea. Then, he hastily excused himself and ran out to instruct the kitchen to prepare top-quality wine and food, and to send someone to the stables to care for the vehicles and livestock. He was so busy arranging everything, running in and out, that his throat became dry and his legs ached, yet he still felt that many things were not done properly. He was constantly sweating and anxious. In reality, the two distinguished guests and their entourage were entirely under Master Wu's care. He had the three best rooms prepared, with Commander An and Advisor Hu each taking a room on the east and west sides. He himself, along with several respectable attendants, went to stay in the east wing. He also instructed the guards and soldiers to occupy the west wing, but to rotate shifts so that there was always a uniformed guard with a gun sitting in the middle room of the main building, available for the two dignitaries to call upon at any time, and also acting as a kind of gatekeeper to enhance the appearance of importance. After arranging everything properly, he personally accompanied them to a simple dinner, after which it was already past the first watch of the night. The two dignitaries were extremely tired from their journey and retired early to rest. Each spread out their bedding on the heated platform in their rooms. Advisor Hu had a slight addiction to opium and enjoyed indulging himself in solitary contemplation.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Hardens Last Week Amidst a Dearth of Financial Amounts</h3>
<p>Increase: More than Nineteen Taels</p>
<p>The changes in the gold market were quite intense last week, with a confusing state, and a sharp trend. Although there was no major news domestically or abroad, the silver market suddenly experienced a significant drop, which also tightened the local exchange market. However, starting from the beginning of the week, when the opening price for August was low at 728.8 taels, it then fluctuated around 30 taels. Later, due to reports that several small European countries were proposing to reduce tariffs, and that the United States was planning to purchase raw silver to mint silver coins to repay war debts, the price once fell to 726.8 taels. Subsequently, major dealers, the Guangdong Syndicate, and foreign speculators like Joe Joseph actively resisted short-selling. Due to the shrinkage of silver prices, which initially made US dollars tight, they engaged in consolidation. Moreover, as the Lausanne Conference was still difficult to proceed, ticket prices surged forward, described as "fierce advance and slow retreat," soaring by more than twenty taels. By Saturday, the price suddenly reached a new high for the year at 758.5 taels, greatly impacting most short sellers. There was a total turnover of 31.7 taels throughout the week, with a net increase of more than nineteen taels. Overall, financial amounts are dwindling. According to recent transaction records, there were approximately 21,000 taels traded. However, 8,800-8,900 taels from July were still not cleared. Gan Changxiang, Yifengyong, and the Dalian Syndicate still hold long positions. The Guangdong Syndicate, due to recent urgent buying to cover positions, is approximately not short. The premium for deferred positions for long positions is only about one tael, and for bare positions, it has only increased by about ten taels. As for shillings, they have already shrunk by one and a half grades (0.375), and US dollars have shrunk by another 0.0625, almost tightening internally by 0.04375, breaking below one shilling and eight pence. US dollars continue to shrink by 0.075, within 30 yuan. However, exchange rates, such as the pound against the dollar, fell by one cent, while the dollar against the pound fell slightly by 0.0025, consolidating for three weeks. The gold price was settled based on the US dollar, initially pressing around 70 taels, then slightly less, and later at least 60 taels, ultimately still pressing within 70 taels, resulting in a spread of about 40 taels. The overall situation of the week is described below:</p>
<p>(Monday) The Big Strip silver continues to rise by 0.000625, the silver price remains unchanged, the shilling is as before, and the US dollar rises by 0.00125, due to arbitrage. Internally, the pound is firm and the dollar is flat. The opening price for August gold is 728.8 taels, immediately falling by three taels, then piercing through 30 taels. Due to buying activity, it reached 31.7 taels. Later, as sellers suddenly increased, and there were reports that the United States would buy silver and that six small countries were planning to reduce tax rates, sentiment seemed to weaken. At 11:00, it suddenly dropped to 726.8 taels. Subsequently, the Dalian Syndicate and others came to buy, so the closing price was 29.1 taels. The afternoon opened at 29.2 taels, then 28.3 taels, and then rose. It was heard that the Indian exchange reported a small amount, and buying was strong in the rupee market, reaching 36.9 taels. The closing price was 5.1 taels higher than the previous Saturday, with a difference of 10.1 taels throughout the day. The market situation was up and down, with the Guangdong Syndicate selling 1,200-1,300 taels. Demand exceeded supply, and the Dalian Syndicate's movements were inconsistent, with some arbitrage.</p>
<p>(Tuesday) The Big Strip retracts by 0.000625, the silver price shrinks by 0.00125, the shilling is unchanged, and the US dollar shrinks by 0.0025, due to a slight retraction in the British-American exchange rate. Internally, the pound rises and the dollar shrinks, the opposite of the previous day. The gold market opened slightly higher by 1.6 taels, at 38.5 taels. Afterwards, various firms advanced, rising to 39.5 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that the Lausanne Conference was difficult to resolve and would have to be postponed, and the US dollar eased, eventually falling to 33.5 taels. The midday close was 36.3 taels. The afternoon opened at 35.7 taels. Later, because Ruixing covered shorts for Joe Joseph, it rose to 38 taels. Subsequently, sellers did not slacken, retreating to 34.2 taels. The closing price was 34.6 taels, falling back by 2.3 taels, with a fluctuation of 6 taels throughout the day. The Dalian Syndicate bought more and sold less, the Guangdong Syndicate sold 1,000 taels, and foreign merchants covered shorts.</p>
<p>(Wednesday) The Big Strip silver recovers by 0.000625, US silver remains unchanged, the shilling is the same, and the US dollar rises by 0.00125, due to exchange rate consolidation. The pound and gold are even, and the US dollar is slightly higher. The opening price for gold fell slightly by 1.8 taels, to 32.8 taels, then 34.2 taels, and 31 taels at noon. The market was very flat, and transactions were not smooth. The midday close was 32.4 taels. The afternoon was 33.1 taels, then 32.1 taels, and retail came in at 33.6 taels. The closing price was 33.3 taels, decreasing by another 1.3 taels compared to the previous day, with a difference of no more than 3.2 taels throughout the day, and a mediocre trend.</p>
<p>(Thursday) The Big Strip silver retracts by 0.000625 to 0.00125, the silver price is as before, but the listed shilling shrinks by 0.00125. Internally, it also rises, and the gold market moves upwards. The opening price was 36.5 taels, adding 3.2 taels. Afterwards, there were slight fluctuations, falling to 34.5 taels at noon, because major dealers came to sell. The closing price was 35.8 taels. The afternoon opened at 35.1 taels. Later, due to the US dollar strengthening and eager buyers, it rose to 39.5 taels. The closing price was 39.1 taels, recovering 5.8 taels compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of 5.1 taels throughout the day. Transactions were scarce in the morning, and demand exceeded supply in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(Friday) The Big Strip shrinks again by 0.000625, the silver price shrinks by 0.0025, the shilling is unchanged, and the US dollar shrinks by 0.00125, due to a slight drop in exchange rates. The trend of the domestic market is upright, and Japanese banks have a strong appetite. The gold market opened immediately, rushing to 40 taels, adding 2.4 taels, to 41.5 taels, then 40.09 taels. Afterwards, it soared, until the midday close was 46.8 taels, with short sellers covering positions. The afternoon opened at 45.9 taels, then exceeded the 50 tael mark. The shilling was reduced by one grade, especially the Guangdong Syndicate, Yifeng, Bingxing, etc., covering shorts. Subsequently, it reached 57.5 taels, then 55.6 taels. The closing price was 57.2 taels, a surge of 18.1 taels compared to the previous day, with a difference of 16.6 taels between the morning and afternoon markets, a situation not seen for a long time. The Dalian Syndicate's movements were inconsistent. The Guangdong Syndicate covered more than 3,000 taels, and foreign merchants Joe Joseph also covered 700-800 taels. Therefore, the market situation had a soaring momentum.</p>
<p>(Saturday) The Big Strip continues to shrink by 0.0025 to 0.001875, the silver price is 0.00375, the shilling and US dollar are unchanged. Internally, the pound is flat and the dollar is loose, while the trend of the gold market is reversed. The opening price was slightly lower by 0.0004 tael, at 56.8 taels, because the silver price shrank too much. However, the private telegraph shrank by half, so the price should have been increased to 58.5 taels. After entering the market, the trend was fluctuating, eventually reaching 50.02 taels at noon. Ultimately, because people's hearts were flustered and uncertain, there were more sellers, the opposite of the previous day. The midday close was 51.1 taels, a decrease of 6.1 taels compared to the previous day. There was also a fluctuation of 8.3 taels in half a day. The Guangdong Syndicate bought slightly, short positions covered slightly, and long positions took the opportunity to sell, it is said.</p>

<h3>Securities Market Turns Smooth with Slightly Rising Prices Last Week</h3>
<p>Over 29.5 Million in Transactions</p>
<p>Entire Six Falls Significantly, Others Slightly Rebound</p>
<p>Last week (from June 20th to 25th), the spot market situation of various bonds on the local Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was as follows: The spot market was very deserted, with few transactions each day. Statistics for the entire week showed only 75,000 yuan in transactions, including 13,000 yuan each for the 19 Customs and 20 Customs bonds, 10,000 yuan for the Entire Six Customs bonds, and only several thousand yuan for others. The futures market was more active than the previous week. Market buying and selling transactions for the entire week were generally active. This was because the prices fluctuated uncertainly last week, and the approaching end of the month for delivery led to more hedging and settlement of transactions. Examining the daily transaction situation for the entire week, the fewest transactions were on Wednesday, with over 2.8 million yuan. Tuesday had over 4.4 million yuan, Thursday reached over 6.2 million yuan, and the daily average was over 5 million yuan, totaling 29.49 million yuan, an increase of over 8 million yuan compared to the previous week. This included 2.8005 million yuan for the Salt Tax June contract, 3.26 million yuan for the July contract, 2.75 million yuan for the Consolidated Tax June contract, 2.455 million yuan for the July contract, 2.28 million yuan for the 20 Customs June contract, 1.8 million yuan for the July contract, 2.21 million yuan for the 20 Reel June contract, 1.865 million yuan for the July contract, 1.385 million yuan for the 19 Good June contract, 1.19 million yuan for the July contract, 1.37 million yuan for the 19 Customs June contract, 1.005 million yuan for the July contract, 1.545 million yuan for the Retrenchment June contract, 870,000 yuan for the July contract, 1.16 million yuan for the Dismissal June contract, 365,000 yuan for the July contract, 650,000 yuan for the Customs Tax June contract, 20,000 yuan for the July contract, 275,000 yuan for the Restructuring Six Li June contract, 135,000 yuan for the July contract, and 95,000 yuan for the Nine Six Li June contract. The futures trading for the July contract continued to be more active than before. As for the price changes of various bonds last week, the chaotic diplomatic situation, the news of Northeast customs duties being withheld, and the tense situation in the South made the market uneasy. The supply and demand situation fluctuated, leading to chaotic prices that fluctuated daily without a consistent trend. On Monday, the overall situation was better, and market buying was strong, raising prices by half a yuan to 8 or 9 jiao. From Tuesday to Friday, the Entire Six bonds experienced sharp falls due to very scarce demand, while others generally hovered or declined, with only slight fluctuations of several jiao each day. On the last day of the week, as it was the time for delivery, buying activity increased, and prices rebounded. Statistics for the entire week showed that, except for the Entire Six, which fluctuated by 2 yuan, the others only fluctuated by about 1 yuan. Compared to the previous week, the Entire Six fell by 1.67 yuan, while others rebounded by about 2 jiao, with only a few slightly weaker. The spot price of the 19 Customs Tax rose by 1.6 jiao. Judging from the current market situation, it is difficult to expect development for the time being. The futures market for the June contract will be suspended starting next week in preparation for delivery. New trading in the August contract will begin on Tuesday, it is said. The following table lists the high and low prices and fluctuations of various bonds last week (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Bond Type Spot/Futures Highest (Week) Lowest (Week) Difference Rise Fall</p>
<p>Entire Six Spot 37.002 35.005 2.00 Fall 1.30</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market in a Soft Process Last Week</h3>
<p>Slight Signs of Movement at the Weekend</p>
<p>At the beginning of last week, the cotton yarn market continued to decline daily, as the surrounding environment deteriorated, it was indeed quiet, and no one seemed excited. At a time when the social economy was exhausted and the countryside was declining, buyers felt increasingly lacking, so yarn sales were hopeless and people were unsettled. In addition, Japanese competitors were particularly fierce, with especially low prices for yarn sales in all directions, attracting buyers. This seriously impacted local yarn, causing anxiety among buyers. Some with multiple散lots had to cut their losses, so the spot yarn market broke through the 40 tael mark, causing panic in the market and seemingly becoming unmanageable. Later, on Friday, Rongxing alone bought to cover shorts, but with the environment as it was, it was still difficult to recover. On Saturday, it was heard that the United States was buying a large amount of cotton on credit from our country, and the negotiations were progressing to a considerable extent, causing panic in the market. The opening price suddenly fell by more than 2 taels, breaking through the 39 tael mark. However, it was found that the Rongxing dealer took advantage of the fall to buy as much as possible, turning from short to long, and most of the amount was snapped up. The market suddenly rebounded, returning to its original state, causing great confusion in the market. The situation was very complicated. The afternoon market was still tight, and the atmosphere in the market suddenly changed, showing signs of a good profit. Most people expected the spot yarn price to return to 145-6 taels. However, after falling for many days, this rebound was expected. Although there is a major dealer turning long at the moment, what will happen in the future depends on actual demand as the biggest key. It was found that customers bought a total of 4,138 bales of yarn during the week, with Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong and Sichuan buying the most. Other places such as the Yangtze River and North China have been occupied by Japanese merchants. The spot yarn market was very lively this week, with a total of 187,700 bales traded. The amount bought by each group is listed below:</p>

<h3>A Common View of the Cotton Market Over the Past Week</h3>
<p>Current Cotton Consumption Almost Equal to Zero</p>
<p>The cotton market was relatively stable last week. Due to reports of pests in American cotton, prices hovered around the five-fen mark, showing signs of stabilizing. As a result, buyers were more confident, pulled harder, and most bought more. However, in reality, there was still no good news. Local cotton consumption was quiet, and factories had already absorbed a lot of foreign cotton, with no appetite for more, so major dealers were inclined to sell. However, buyers were optimistic because they feared there would not be enough supply for delivery in July, so even though the yarn market fell, the cotton market was still able to maintain. At the weekend, it was heard that the United States was selling 600,000 bales of cotton on credit to our country, and there was considerable progress, so people were shaken and the market was slightly weaker. In short, judging from the overall situation, it was rather bleak, but the market situation was still flat and it was difficult to fall further at the moment, because there were major dealers buying, so it was still a fluctuating situation. Spot cotton trading was very active during the week, with a total of 322,200 dan traded. Current cotton demand from various factories was still sluggish. The source on the docks was 1,150 bales of Yaohua. The price of American cotton rose by 10 pounds compared to the previous week. The selling prices and amounts of spot cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Name High Price Low Price Volume Traded Term</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 26.75 :: 300 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Fine Velvet Cotton 29.50 :: 128 pieces Spot Warehouse Delivery</p>
<p>Jiaotong Zhou Cotton 28.00 :: 100 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Yuyao Cotton 25.50 25.25 1,500 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>The high and low prices of Zheng Biao for the week are listed below:</p>

<h3>American Cotton Long Positions Closed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to long positions being closed, but later rebounded due to buying from the industry, with futures rising by 1-2 points and spot prices unchanged. British cotton futures fell by 3 points and spot prices rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton market closed.

<h3>Silk Tea Guangxi-Guangdong Young Tea Not Yet Harvested</h3>
<p>Due to favorable weather in the past ten days, the young tea in Shangrao, Qianshan, Yutian, and Hekou areas of Jiangxi Province has developed exceptionally thickly. The fertile tea around the islands is green and lush on the trees, no less than the first crop. The mountain farmers are eager to harvest and process it for sale due to the good production. However, due to the sluggish tea sales in the Shanghai market, various red tea firms in Hekou have already closed their operations. Those engaged in green tea business, totaling only three or four in places such as Hekou, Yushan Zhengjiafang, Zhangcaicai Street, and Xiaoyushan, have already reached their capacity and cannot take in more. In addition, the mountain price of this year's first tea was high, and sales in the market resulted in losses. Therefore, this year's young tea will ultimately become old and withered leaves. Some mountain farmers, unwilling to let it go to waste, still select the best to pick and process for sale to stores and shops. According to tea merchants in the area, approximately 2,000-3,000 dan of spring tea in the four areas of Shangrao, Qianshan, Yutian, and Hekou were not harvested and left to wither, which has some impact on the farmers' economy, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Second Batch of Boxed Tea Shipped to Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Since the start of weighing and purchasing tea in various villages and tea shops in Wuyuan County, they have been rushing to produce "chouxin" tea and shipping it to Shanghai. Later, when the market price declined, many stopped production halfway and switched to producing "puzhen" tea. In the past month, in addition to the first-grade "chouxin zhenmei," "gongxi," "zhen," "xiu," and "fengmei" varieties, which were shipped to Shanghai early, the second-grade "zhenmei" variety of boxed tea has also been gradually completed. Because the threat of the Gan River bandits is still rampant, they dare not use waterways for transportation. In recent days, they have been hiring laborers to transport the tea on foot via land routes, transferring to Hangzhou for shipment to Shanghai. It is estimated that no less than 4,000 boxes have been dispatched. Shops with fewer tea purchases may close down within the month. As for the young tea in Xiazhuang, it is developing very thickly due to the favorable weather, and its quality and taste are no less than the spring tea. Because mountain farmers are hoarding most of the first tea and unwilling to sell it, and the shops are unwilling to buy and store it, little young tea has been harvested and processed to date, and the market is very quiet, it is said.</p>
<h3>Origin of the Popularity of Low-Grade Green Tea</h3>
<p>Since the news of Japan offering a new batch of "Precious Eyebrow" tea at fifty taels reached Morocco, British trading houses in Shanghai have been receiving orders for Japanese tea as numerous as snowflakes. At that time, the price of low-grade "Precious Eyebrow" tea from Shanghai needed to be priced at seventy to eighty taels per dan. During this period of global economic recession, tea merchants there, considering Japanese tea to be inexpensive and Chinese tea to be expensive, abandoned Chinese tea in favor of Japanese tea. Consequently, Chinese and foreign tea merchants in Shanghai warned each other in alarm, deeply fearing that the position of Chinese tea in Morocco would henceforth be seized by Japanese tea. The British firm Jardine Matheson, particularly concerned about the significant impact of foreign tea merchants' inclination towards Japanese tea on the future of Chinese tea, specially manufactured a new type of low-grade "Precious Eyebrow" tea and offered it to Morocco at the lowest price of forty-eight taels. As a result, foreign tea merchants again gravitated towards Chinese tea and uniformly cancelled their previously placed orders for Japanese tea. Therefore, recently, the trade in low-grade "Precious Eyebrow" tea from areas such as Wenzhou and Yushan has been exceptionally brisk, and tea firms are also actively sourcing supplies of secondary tea leaves to meet sales demand.</p>
<h3>Silk Market Remained Difficult Last Week</h3>
<p>The French Sales Were Fleeting: The Price of Factory Silk Was Not High</p>
<p>Dry Cocoons Had No Way to Be Pawned: Silk Merchants Sold in Pain</p>
<p>Last week, the silk market in Shanghai remained lacking in any upward trend. Although there was a need for spot goods from factories in Lyon, the offered prices were not high. Hearing the news, Japanese silk merchants competitively lowered prices and encroached on sales, causing the Shanghai market to be like a fleeting moment of brilliance, quickly becoming quiet within the week, and prices fell sharply instead. Due to Japanese silk being sold at any price regardless of cost in New York, England, and elsewhere, Chinese silk has been almost completely encroached upon, and sales to America and other regions remained stagnant, with prices continuing to weaken. Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, considering the poor harvest and quality of native silk this year, and observing that factory silk prices had already fallen to their lowest limit, took the opportunity to purchase silk dumped by merchants. Last week, the sales channels for factory silk were not quiet, but the market price was not high and there were no subsidies of one hundred taels (The government subsidized silk merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang one hundred taels per package of silk exported from Chen's factory). Because manufacturers had nowhere to pawn their dry cocoons (silver shops and banks did not offer loans on dry cocoons), they had to sell them painfully, reel the silk from the cocoons and deliver it. The existing silks that were being held as collateral by Chen’s Factory couldn't be sold because they would not be able to even recover the initial principal and interest on them, and would furthermore result in a loss of over five hundred taels in cost. It was therefore all held and not moved, with the intention of simply paying additional interest and warehouse rent. Because once sold, the advances that the silk firms or warehouses had paid in advance (last year, when the silk was sent to the warehouse, the price of silk was around one thousand taels, and the silk firms or warehouses paid more than eight hundred taels per package in advance), and the unpaid portions of the principal and interest of the loans made by the silk firms and warehouses against the silk had to be paid, it was difficult to sell immediately. All of this was caused by the unfavorable economic situation. Last week, overseas Chinese silk prices continued to decline, with Lyon being the most affected. The market prices at the end of the week are recorded below (New York price per pound, unit: US dollars; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: French francs):</p>
<p>Silk Type New York Lyon Silk Type New York Lyon</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Spun 1.40 116 Superior Dry Spun 1.19 84</p>
<p>Superior Shanghai Spun 1.28 101 Medium Dry Spun 1.06 71</p>
<p>Medium Shanghai Spun 1.16 86 Inferior Dry Spun 0.92 58</p>
<p>Inferior Shanghai Spun 1.04 73 Superior Large Spun 1.12 81</p>
<p>Superior Shandong Spun 1.20 92 Inferior Large Spun 0.85 50</p>
<p>Superior Sichuan Spun 1.15 84 Superior White Silk 0.69 41</p>
<p>Superior Gray Spun 0.60 23</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Closed Due to Rain</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Although the source of supply from various groups yesterday was still not abundant, about six or seven ships arrived. There was a considerable amount of goods stored in warehouses in Pucun. The financial situation was tight due to the banks' termination of operations at the end of June. Moreover, because of the continuous rain, only two firms, Wanxing and Tongtai, conducted business, trading several tens of stones of thick japonica rice. It will be clear and dry for trading today.</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, in the rice market of North Shanghai, there were a dozen or so sources of supply from various groups along the Suzhou River. The amount of goods remaining in the warehouses along the river was still plentiful. Due to the heavy rain in the morning, there were very few transactions on the street. The opening price for North Japonica rice rose slightly. Early indica rice and early rice showed no improvement, exhibiting a downward trend.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw and White Sugar Prices Mostly Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's market allocation and trading was very limited, but the atmosphere was quite firm. Dutch sugar No. 24 raw and white sugar was quoted at fourteen taels and two mace, high-quality goods at fourteen taels and two and a half mace, and Hong Kong goods at fourteen taels. The buying interest was slow, and the transactions were scattered, with the trend slightly shifting to flat. Raw sugar with red markings was eleven taels and eight mace, No. 9 Dutch red sugar was nine taels, nine mace, and seven and a half candareens, and No. 8 goods were nine taels and seven mace. The market situation was very firm. Taikoo Sugar's B Mark was sixteen taels and two mace, CW Mark was fifteen taels and eight mace, DY Mark was fifteen taels and five and a half mace, and H Mark was twelve taels and four mace, which was very popular. HM Mark was quoted at fifteen taels, but buyers were still observing. 350 bags of Tianjin's B Mark Zhenxin brand were sold for 15 taels and nine mace per bag. This was because the burlap was lighter, the packaging was torn, and the price was more appropriate than the market price.</p>
<h3>Metal Market: Scant Transactions Due to Moldy Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, with the pouring moldy rain, there were even fewer transactions in the metal market. Because it was the weekend, trading was slow for suppliers and factories. In addition, due to the continuous rain, the number of people attending tea gatherings and markets was exceptionally scarce. Therefore, there was not much negotiation. The goods offered were only one hundred barrels of French-made iron nails, sixty dan of British steel plates, and over three hundred dan of new and old lead wire. Other than that, there were only inquiries. As for the market situation, there was no significant change.</p>

<h3>Consoling the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>— Lang Dexiong</p>
<p>At the beginning of the January 28th Incident, the Fudan Volunteer Army, filled with righteous indignation, rushed to Brigadier General Weng's camp day and night, requesting to fight the enemy. They further advocated for the Nineteenth Route Army to take a proactive stance, and with the army's wholehearted cooperation, they repeatedly thwarted the enemy's advances. Ultimately, due to the disparity in numbers, they retreated to Anting, making a desperate stand against the city. Suddenly, with the signing of a peace agreement, their aspirations were not fulfilled, and they returned in anguish. The faculty and students of our school held a welcome rally to console them. I composed four quatrains out of gratitude.</p>
<p>Joining the army to recover our old lands,</p>
<p>Not ashamed of being scholars with many skills.</p>
<p>Bullets and smoke baptized them,</p>
<p>Teachers and students meet again, feeling the passage of time.</p>
<p>With a rainbow as their spirit and iron as their heart,</p>
<p>They refuse to let the East be陷Lu沈!</p>
<p>Their fame shook far and wide,</p>
<p>Spring breezes and timely rains revered them universally.</p>
<p>Riding alone with a sword, they disregarded their lives,</p>
<p>Sharing the same purpose, where were the rest?</p>
<p>Exchanging books for battlefield bones,</p>
<p>Wu Mu's heartache, his ambition unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Unable to return after laying down their arms,</p>
<p>The essence of Shanghai was reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Though the land is not completely broken,</p>
<p>Jiangcheng still has the Yue Jade Terrace.</p>

<h3>Manufacturing Method of Non-Perishable Paste</h3>
<p>— Er Cheng</p>
<p>Advantages of Non-Perishable Paste | Paste is a daily necessity, such as for mailing letters and sticking items, they must be used. However, paste made by ordinary methods tends to rot easily and becomes unusable after a few days, producing an unpleasant odor that is detrimental to hygiene. Moreover, ordinary paste often causes wrinkles when pasting paper, making it difficult to flatten, which is even more unsatisfactory for us. To eliminate these shortcomings, one must use specially made non-perishable paste. Although this type of paste is sold on the market, it is quite expensive and not very economical. Therefore, I am going to introduce to you a method of making non-perishable paste that is inexpensive and has the same effect. This method has been tested by me repeatedly and is considered very satisfactory. Readers can try it according to this method.</p>
<p>Raw Materials | Flour, salicylic acid (available in pharmacies), honey (available in pharmacies), clean water</p>
<p>Method | First, wrap the flour in summer cloth (other porous cloths can also be used), then place it in clean water and stir it frequently by hand. The flour will gradually dissolve in the water, forming a white, non-viscous liquid. When this liquid is very thick, the flour包 can be removed. What remains inside the包 is flour residue containing protein, which is not suitable for making paste and can be discarded. Then place this liquid in a ceramic container (such as a ceramic basin; copperware should not be used, as it may turn the paste green, which is unsightly). Heat it over a gentle fire (i.e., a fire with a low flame), stirring it with a stick. The white liquid will gradually mature and become viscous. Then add a little honey (optional). At this point, you can test whether it has been successfully made. The test method is to raise the stirring stick dipped in paste. If the paste drips continuously and is like 牛皮 sugar, it is done. (This depends entirely on experience and is difficult to explain clearly. This is just a testing method.) When it is successfully made, remove the container. When it is half cold, add a certain amount of salicylic acid and mix vigorously. The non-perishable paste is complete. If you think it is too thin, you can reheat it to evaporate the water.</p>

<h3>Such Friends</h3>
<p>— Bei Lei</p>
<p>I remember studying at XX Middle School, I was lucky enough to make the acquaintance of these wealthy friends:</p>
<p>One was Mr. Chen, the son of a compradore of a certain foreign firm at sea who owned two eight-cylinder Buicks at home.</p>
<p>One was Mr. W, whose father was once a prominent official in Shandong. Although he has now passed away, the wealth he left behind, squeezed from the people, was inherited by him. So, he has never panicked about the problem of money. And according to him, he knows several important figures in the current government.</p>
<p>One was a descendant of Gu Tinglin of Kunshan, a complete young master, and absolutely romantic. Young man.</p>
<p>There were also three Y, M and P who were referred to as the Three Heroes of the love arena. They were all young masters; and optimists to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>These few young masters were all willing to condescend to associate with me, this very sentimental proletarian. At the time, I really felt flattered and often showed off my high regard.</p>
<p>Young masters, such great figures, undoubtedly disdained to study, especially Chinese, which they thought was unnecessary. So, they either didn't do compositions or didn't take Chinese exams, or else they would use command-like requests to ask me to finish it in an hour. The son of the compradore and Y, one of the Three Heroes, didn't even want to write. Sometimes they didn't even enter the classroom. Old Master X, who always seemed asleep, let the students do whatever they wanted. "The classroom door is always open," and students "come and go in an endless stream," "toiling in vain," and even "leaving without saying goodbye." At this time, I became the center of attention, mustering my spirits to work. I didn't draft or outline, but wrote directly as I felt, and I always managed to hand in the paper in an hour. However, according to my count, I had done at least five Chinese assignments. So, from the bottom of my heart, I felt relieved and thought that my ability to handle things was not bad. Such self-deception and misleading had been in service for the son of the compradore for at least two and a half years. In other words, he had never done any homework on his own, regarding all the Chinese courses.</p>
<p>But "friends," how important are they? How could I refuse a friend's request? So, I lowered my head and did my best to help them. I can say that I never disappointed them in their requests.</p>
<p>What's it like now? Alas! "I can't bear to recall the past." In short, "such friends" have made me realize what "friends are like."</p>
<p>Admitting that I am not used to climbing up, admitting that I am worthless</p>
<p>I finally dropped out of school at the beginning of a certain semester. Suffering from all kinds of hidden pains, suffering from all kinds of hardships; I often cried. I was sorry to my parents, sorry to those who might sympathize with me, and sorry to everyone. The mistake was only my mistake, and the pain was only my pain. Who really knew me? Who was my true friend? Or encouraged me to "cheer up." But, friends! Only you still don't know my heart.</p>
<p>In order to find a path to strive for myself, I thought of my wealthy friends and used begging words to ask them to introduce me to a job. But the news was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no word or paper. Is it because the times are like this, and there are more people than jobs? Yes, maybe the job exists but is not good? Maybe that's it, but friends, can't you give me some sympathy? If there is no sympathy between people, what is the value of survival? Ah! Ah! Friends, I know now, the poor and the rich are simply not worthy of making friends! But can't friends think back to the time when they asked me to take the exams for them?</p>
<p>I wander on a gray journey, not knowing when I will be able to obtain the sweet spring of the true meaning of life; I also don't know if there will be someone who will shed sincere tears with me? I, this sentimental proletarian, alas!</p>
<p>Living in a Dream</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Dance Hall</h3>
<p>— Yan Meng</p>
<p>Shanghai people are particularly clever, they have both the so-called "Entertainment to Save the Nation" and comrades who dance to forget the national crisis. A nation that enjoys pleasure and is numb will always be in a drunken dream. The deeper the national crisis, the more people dance, which is truly a good example of a decadent nation.</p>
<p>The rise of Shanghai dance halls has been extremely widespread in the past few years. In the evening, walking on the streets, there is the melodious sound of strings to the east, and the music of dance to the west. The "Lian An" electric lights, red in one团, purple in one片, yellow in one缕, green in one圈, wine bars in the south, and dance halls in the north. How prosperous, today's Shanghai dance halls.</p>
<p>Considering why Shanghai people flock to dancing, there are probably the following reasons. (1) Fashionable socializing; (2) Borrowing dance to dispel worries; (3) Pursuit of flesh. Because if you run around in social gatherings and don't know how to ballroom dance, you will be considered an "阿木林." Who doesn't love beauty in the midst of bright lights and intoxicating drinks?</p>
<p>Soft lights, gentle music, charming flesh - the so-called curve beauty. Unsuccessful heroes linger, embrace, and smile in it. Thus, everything is comforted. But when they are embracing soft 玉 warm 香, they may be remembering their white-haired mother, or their wife is shedding tears, sending a message to the wanderer at the end of the world to cherish himself!</p>
<p>If we think about it when we are sober from our dreams, we will laugh out loud, but I believe that before the laughter stops, our hot tears will roll down. Imperialists, capitalist gentlemen, show off their extravagance, and proletarian youths, the few pieces of silver you have earned with your blood, tears, and sweat are lightly sent to the hands of smiling dancers. What do you get besides getting rid of your worries?</p>
<p>Why not properly organize the promising young heads, blood氣, and spirit? Why not apply them to production and career? Sinking all day long, drunk dancing all night long, not to mention the country, how will you continue to live? When we travel in Jiangnan, how can we not accidentally think of the righteous soldiers in the bloodbath of the Northeast who are fighting desperately?</p>
<p>Dance halls are naturally gentle, but they are full of cowardice, pain, and sin! If we don't go to the battlefield, we should at least leave the dance hall. As far as I know, young artists, disappointed officers, bored politicians, and depressed wanderers, friends, are we still citizens of the Republic of China? For our fluttering motherland, shouldn't we fulfill a little responsibility?</p>
<p>Street Corner</p>
<h3>An Open Secret</h3>
<p>— Shi Ben</p>
<p>Xiao Wanzhi, from Jiangbei, held a greasy wooden tray in his hand, filled with a dozen or so red and green彩 eggs and packages of colorful candies, along with a set of (White 相 Great World) riddle paper slips, plus a rough flower bowl. At the entrance of an alley, he propped up a frame, placed the wooden tray on it, and began his usual roadside career. After arranging this small mobile store, a group of children and labor friends swarmed over like flies seeing rotten meat. Some played (White 相 Great World), and some wanted to throw dice. Xiao Wanzhi took out six generals (i.e., dice) from his pocket, put them in the bowl, and gambled with these patrons. Originally, the items displayed on his tray were just for show, and the only business he relied on was the bowl and six dice.</p>
<p>"Four, five, six!" Haha. "One, two, three!" Lost. While he was happily playing with the gamblers, he suddenly heard the sound of footsteps. He looked up and saw a police officer in uniform with a wooden stick standing in front of him, staring intently at his livelihood. Having been in business for many years, he was experienced and knew the tricks of the trade. Seeing this police officer's majestic arrival but not interfering with his actions, he knew what he meant (no need to explain to an intelligent person). He immediately pursed his lips and nodded his head. Ridiculously, this brave and armed police officer, after such a mysterious hint from Xiao Wanzhi, immediately turned around like he had been hit by a retreating spell and walked away lightly. Seeing him leave, Xiao Wanzhi took out a handful of copper coins from his pocket, too many to count, about fifty or sixty, and handed them to a porter beside him, pointing with his hand and telling him to take the money to the police officer. The porter had already understood and ran to the police officer like he was flying, offering it up. The police officer was originally walking slowly, waiting for Xiao Wanzhi's tribute. Now that the object of his desire had arrived, he smiled at the temporary bribery representative, accepted this (no need to explain to an intelligent person), and continued to walk away with his chest out and belly bulging, to do the Xth (no need to explain to an intelligent person) in another road.</p>
<p>"Alas! Damn it, I haven't earned much money from my business, and the伙 has taken away more than six hundred. This kind of business is not good anymore," Xiao Wanzhi's eyes bid farewell to the police officer's departure, waiting until even his shadow could not be seen before saying this.</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<h3>Children in Intellectual Famine</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>Open-air Education One "Are there any new books?"</p>
<p>"I want to borrow it - a good-looking one!"</p>
<p>On every street, you can encounter groups of children carrying schoolbags - especially when going to and from school - asking at the street-side book rental stalls.</p>
<p>"Yes, there are many good-looking books!" The owner of the small book stall, Xing, would routinely answer the children who were just embarking on the path of knowledge with a slow, seductive tone. He obtained the nourishment for his life from their one copper coin for one book, one copper coin for two books; they obtained some pitiful knowledge from him to fill their small, empty intellectual domain. - Their relationship was thus chained together.</p>
<p>"Look! The Hunyuan Patriarch used the Immortal Binding Rope to capture the Demon Dragon!"</p>
<p>"Good, Jiangnan Wine Hero scared away the flower thief." When I walked past the small book stall and saw them sitting closely on the benches or wooden boxes beside the book stall, reading with animated gestures, I often felt a nameless sadness evoked by their joyous expressions. Ah, my poor children who are suffering from intellectual famine, although it is said that you are the masters of the future, but that is "the future", the "present" world is excluded. Who cares if you are receiving lessons in gods, ghosts, and obscenity?</p>
<p>Starving children! Nibble away! This only black bread, how can I bear to take it away and tell you not to nibble - although I also want to give you some better food to fill your stomachs.</p>
<p>Chatting</p>
<h3>Suppressing Bandits</h3>
<p>— Qing Ping</p>
<p>The mosquitoes last night were especially rampant because of the hotter weather. They are afraid of nothing unless you put up a mosquito net, they can't get in; otherwise, even if you light a mosquito coil, it is useless, you can only let them enjoy themselves.</p>
<p>We were sleeping on "ground铺", and the mosquito net was not hung. The six people in the room were similarly disturbed and unable to sleep. Around eleven o'clock, Mr. W couldn't bear it anymore, cursing viciously and sighing. Mr. Y, nicknamed "Dead Cat", was usually taciturn, and followed up by saying, "Ah, it's really embarrassing; they are stinging people to death, anyway, I can't sleep!" Everyone in the room started talking, so they simply turned over and sat up, opening an emergency meeting to suppress the bandits - mosquitoes - to discuss all kinds of ways to prevent the spread of the bandit force. The members of the room were members, and no chairman was elected, only everyone freely expressed their opinions; the order was chaotic, and they babbled nonsense, without any formal resolution.</p>
<p>"The bandits have a great spirit of sacrifice. It is only to our disadvantage to engage them in hand-to-hand combat, it doesn't pay. The best way is to use smoke bombs to trap them tightly in the room, and exterminate them all by fumigating them." S's opinion.</p>
<p>"This is certainly a very practical method, but it is still not thorough. It seems more appropriate to have a large-scale allied force advance. Otherwise, install an electric net - screen - so that the bandits have no way to invade." L suggested, "I second the motion - but installing an electric net costs a lot of money, so we have to ask the government - the school authorities - to work hard; our strength is limited and we definitely can't reach it." When W spoke, he had the same gestures and the same tone as usual.</p>
<p>"Now we can summarize, our methods can be divided into active and passive. Speaking from the active side, the principle is of course to fundamentally eradicate and eliminate. Speaking from the passive side, it is to avoid the current disaster, and the best way is to hang up mosquito nets, and if you don't have one, you should buy one as soon as possible." I said.</p>
<p>"Since this is the case, we need to have a tight organization: now we can allocate duties, let's elect a commander-in-chief." The talkative Mr. S again made a strong suggestion.</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. H, who was nicknamed General Bai Chuan because of his similar appearance, was elected as the commander-in-chief of bandit suppression. At that time, we were going to force him to carry out the oath-taking ceremony.</p>
<p>Mr. Y only said one sentence at the beginning, then turned around and burrowed into the quilt, and didn't care about anyone! I don't know what kind of nervous system he has, he is not afraid of suffocation or hotness. After all, he is a dead cat and has never opened his mouth.</p>
<p>Everyone was a little tired, drowsy and half-asleep, maintaining silence. Faintly audible was the slight sound of fingernails scratching an itch.</p>
<p>At dawn, the bandit atmosphere was slightly reduced, and finally, I slept soundly for an hour!</p>

<p>Family Problems</p>
<h3>A Friend's Wedding</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>It's really terrible. The little child is crying and clamoring for his mother, but his mother went to a banquet! It’s a wedding of a female classmate from five years ago. From ten o'clock in the morning until now, it's almost midnight, and she still hasn't returned. I am really angry; for a wedding banquet of unrelated people, she can actually bear to leave the child crying at home.</p>
<p>There's no way around it, so I have to try every possible way to coax the child, but he is still crying and clamoring. But I still have to wait, enduring the mood, waiting and waiting, until she comes back from outside smiling. Sure enough, the child stopped crying, but I was prepared to lose my temper, but she actually kissed me first, what else can I say? Moreover, my wife has already begun to draw out her voice to report her experience as a guest.</p>
<p>"It was really lively, much more lavish than our wedding. A very large auditorium, completely filled with valuable congratulatory banners and beautiful flower baskets, and huge illuminated characters. The intensity of that light almost hurt my eyes. There were countless guests, all young and beautiful, especially the women, none of them were not several times more lavish than me. I really shouldn't have gone. In comparison, it was really embarrassing, almost more clumsy than the maid in her house. (At this time, she intentionally glanced at me askance, seemingly with endless resentment, but I also deliberately lowered my head, clearly wanting to avoid eye contact.) But today's banquet was clumsy, and the few bottles of wine were also very cheap. I really don't understand why they had to penny-pinch on the food and drink. I gave a five-dollar gift, but it's not worth eating this kind of meal. : :"</p>
<p>I have nothing to say, and I don't want to say anything, just listening. But she is still excitedly continuing to talk, also mocking, also admiring.</p>
<p>Soon, the child fell asleep in bed, so she also prepared to sleep, but when she was tidying up her clothes, she exclaimed in panic, even stomping her feet in anxiety, ah! It turned out that she discovered that the gemstone on her ring had fallen off. So I asked:</p>
<p>"When did you get a gemstone ring?"</p>
<p>"This is because I had to be a guest today, so I borrowed it from Mrs. Li! Now that it's fallen off, what should I do?"</p>
<p>She is about to cry. : :</p>
<p>Reply</p>
<p>Reply to a certain gentleman: Ammonia (Aminonia) has an unpleasant smell, but it can treat insect bites very effectively. When my skin is bitten by mosquitoes or bedbugs, I often apply floral water, but the floral water on the market is not effective in treating insects, so I added ammonia to increase its effectiveness. Moreover, it is very volatile. If added properly, it can enhance the fragrance. When the bottle is opened, the fragrance is strong. I have tried it more than ten times before and wrote down the best proportions. I made it again once according to the published proportions and still got very good results. Perhaps the ammonia you used is a kind of strong ammonia, so its smell is very strong, and it is also very expensive. I think you also bought too much, spending several dollars in total, and made this kind of smelly thing, you must hate me, so you didn't use a salutation and went to seek advice from scholars across the country. But for ten days, no one has replied in the publication. You need to know that scientific experimentation relies entirely on your own flexibility, especially this kind of mixed preparation. Just add a little strong ammonia to make it not smelly. If you don’t add it, it doesn’t matter. It’s not like making soap and snow cream where the proportions are too far off and there is a situation of incomplete saponification, etc. Moreover, you like to experiment and need to have patience. The smelly floral water you made doesn’t need to be discarded. Just open the bottle and leave it overnight, and it can become not smelly. I hope you will continue to work hard and experiment.
