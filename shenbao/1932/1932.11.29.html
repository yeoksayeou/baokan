<p>十九委會下月一日召集再决定大會日期</p>
<p>小國代表踴躍參加發言美國態度堪注目</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政院今晨開會、僅歷十分鐘、决定將中日提交國聯大會之特會、英外相西門已返倫敦、故由外部次官艾登爲英代表、主席凡勒拉於開會後、宣讀日代表松岡來函、略述其所接之東京政府訓令、謂日本維持其對於盟約第十五條關於將此問題移交大會事之保留、故拒絕投票云與會各代表皆不願表示意見、亦不欲有所詢問、故主席宣佈討論中止、於是依據盟約第十五條將此事提交大會之提議、乃通過、主席向李頓調查團各委員致詞謝其襄助、並謂如特别大會需其襄助、仍將請其出席云、日代表松岡對此提出保留、以日本認調查團之工作業已完畢爲理由、此項保留已被紀錄、會議至是閉幕（二十八日路透社電）　　（日内瓦）中日現已提交大會、後事趨勢如何、頗爲人所推測、種種建議乃復發作、在國聯外召集會議、羅致非戰公約與九國公約簽字國參加於中之説、猶未爲人所抛棄、同時又有人主張請美俄兩國加入十九特委員、專注其力於國聯盟約第十五條第三項下之和解手續、該項條文爲</p>
<p>「行政院應盡力使此爭議得以解决、如其有效須將關於該爭議之事實與解釋、並此項解决之條文酌量公佈」</p>
<p>復有人建議限十九國特委會於六十日内辦理此事、如期滿而無效果、則大會應依照盟約第十五條第四項考慮此後應以何種行動爲必要、第四文曰</p>
<p>「倘爭議不能如此解决則行政院經全體或多數之表决應繕發報告書説明爭議之事實及行政院所認爲公允適當之建議」不幸上述兩種計畫、皆須視美俄加入而後可、以目前情勢言、此兩國似皆不願爲國聯分責也、國聯秘書長有召集大會之資格、今日已與大會議長希孟接洽開會日期、大約十二月五日或六日須開會、十九特委會以希孟爲主席者定星期四日集議、届時當可承認大會之召集、預料大會一般討論約須一星期或十天已報告發言者、有南愛代表凡勒拉·捷克代表皮恩士·西班牙代表馬達利加、此外料必發言者、有瑞典·挪威·與南美數國及英法意代表、辯論大概將以原則問題爲限、而使各國對於李頓報吿書及國聯盟約是否被破壞之大問題、表明其態度、此番討論、可使美國覩知國聯之立塲、而因此决定其態度、美國現雖以爲此乃國聯事故不願分荷其担負、但衆信一旦美國旣了解國聯眞有辦理此案之準備、則亦未嘗不可予國聯以若干合作也、總之、大會討論之趨勢、尤其爲大會對於國聯原則之追認、如美國認爲滿意、則美國當可抛棄其現有之旁觀態度、而依允合作也、他日大會一般討論結束後、十九特委會或將受命綜合其辯論、而繕具一種報告書或决議案、同時調解物續將依照預定方法着手進行、（二十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>闡明我國家基礎之鞏固</p>

<p>國際委會之組織</p>
<h3>我國堅决反對</h3>
<p>有損我領土主權之完整</p>
<p>祇係日内瓦之一種推測</p>
<p>國聯决不致採取此辦法</p>
<p>（南京）二十七日外電推測國聯大會趨勢、謂將要求中國於國聯監視下、保障日本在滿之權益、並將組織國際行政及軍事委員會、實行監視滿洲行政並决定何時日本權益已有相當保障、日軍應行退出滿洲、官方對此認爲祇係日内瓦之一種推測、並信國聯大會將來亦决不致採取此種爲中國全國所誓死反對之辦法、蓋此項計劃有損中國領土主權之完整、與九國公約之精神完全相反云（二十八日中央社電）</p>
<h3>日本畏小國伸正羲</h3>
<p>努力拉攏絕少希望</p>
<p>（東京）此間日人對日内瓦之反應、無新發展、各報對國聯行政院之行爲仍施抨擊、謂其對中日爭案不圖覓取解决方法而移交大會、顯欲諉卸責任、官塲則謂國聯如以爲日本準備變更其關於「滿洲國」獨立之根本立埸、則實大錯云、至於一般民衆、對於將令日本受法庭罪犯待遇之任何建議反對甚力、蓋以各國、尤其爲小國、將成裁判官、彼等所關心者、爲抽象之理論、及判詞之將如何影響其自已之利益、至於滿洲問題眞正之利害、則非所計及也云（二十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外部接到日内瓦代表部報告謂二十七日書翰交議長以後、小國對日感情愈壤、在大會恐難免發生衝突、日政府令松岡代表利用大會前之時間、極力拉攏各小國、求各小國轉變緩和態度、但前途甚少希望（二十八日華聯電）</p>
<h3>日本反對第三國之干預</h3>
<p>深懼美俄參加增强壓力</p>
<p>日電傳正考慮解决私案</p>
<p>（東京）國聯事務局深知中日之紛爭雖移由大會、恐亦難獲滿足之解决、故於大會後之秩序、現方製作一種包含美俄二國之國際政治會議案、欲將問題之解决委諸該會、今晨外務省曾接此情報、帝國政府由下列之論據、决斷然反對、現方待代表部來電請訓云、㈠因中國領土之自已分裂、故於獨立之「滿洲國、」係在適用九國公約範圍之外、帝國之行動並不違反該約故母須開根據該約之國際會議、㈠凡關聯「滿洲國」之會議、不得不依據「滿國」自身之要求、尤其含有蘇俄之國際會議、周圍各國對之加以支持誠無視「滿洲國」之主權、㈠帝國政府所得容認之國際會議、係根據李頓報告書之結論、欲在華建設鞏固之中央政府之國際協力會議案、在拒絕第三國加入之滿洲問題之帝國旣定方針、斷不容加以變更、㈠要之、國際聯盟之意圖、欲以美俄兩國之協力强壓日本、固甚明顯、惟此案帝國政府所絕對所對者也、（二十八日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）在國際聯盟之中日紛爭、確將於本日由理事會移交臨時總會、日本政府已决定方針、苟國聯總會蔑視日本主張、否認「滿洲國」之獨立、或决議結成所謂「滿洲國不承認聯盟」時、日本代表决不躊躇斷行撤回、國聯因日本之退出、不僅失墜面目、即在歐羅巴對於希望退出國聯之各國間、必惹起多大之衝動、而國聯必陷於破局的運命、故確信國聯於臨時總會種種討論之結果、必考慮能保持中日兩國及國聯面目之解决案、對於法案、國聯方面如希望時、日本代表亦準備提出解决私案援助國聯、目下日本所考慮之解决案、聞其大體骨子包含下列各點㈠國聯關於滿洲問題應恿慫恿中日雙方直接交涉、調整具體的解决案㈠直接交涉應於確得遠東和平、採必要之共同動作㈠恢復中日親善關係、從速調整外交關係、㈠確約尊重華盛頓條約非戰條約等中日關係各條約之精神、（二十八日電通電）</p>
<h3>台維斯對滿案之談話</h3>
<p>美聲明係私人性質</p>
<p>紐約紐約時報載華盛頓國務院發言入之言論、據謂台維斯如在日内瓦進行關於李頓報告書及國聯考慮之談話、則係渠私人而百正式之行爲、美國現並未作正式談話、台維斯之赴歐、專辦理世界經濟會議及軍縮兩事云、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>爲保全自身利益英對日妥協歟</h3>
<p>日電所傳如此</p>
<p>（東京）據日内瓦來電、現在國聯方面關於中日問題、最爲人重視者爲英國之意見、日内瓦英代表持最愼重態度、力避發表意見、最近綜合各種情報、英國似將承認日本立場、决與日本妥協、其理由如下、㈠英國迄今全無離開打算而行動之事、且英國漸次明白在現在情勢中、如蔑視日本立塲、則其本身將受打撃、㈡英國極恐印度之赤化、松岡代表留莫斯科當時、英人極爲憂慮此事對於英國對日態度、與以重大影響、本問題對於領有越南之法國及領有荷屬印度之荷蘭、亦有同様之影響、㈢國聯對於日本决定任何處置、然現已不能改變滿洲現狀、不如與日本妥協、確保在華權益更爲利益、㈣英國在理事會支持移交大會方針之理由、似係召開大會討論一次以維持國聯及小國之體面、故此不過係一種手段而已、（二十八日日聯社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本之延宕政策又玄</h3>
<p>㈠日本對國聯主張之内函</p>
<p>國際聯盟行政院會議。中日兩國代表往復辯論後。本報亦已一再加以評論。在理事會中一週以來激戰之結果。止於提交國聯大會解决。不過開會之初。吾人即不敢期望其得具體的結果。且日本軍閥。一意孤行。十五個月以還。每日從事於軍事的冒險政策。然而被國内情。殊不免外强中乾。不僅多顧忌而已</p>
<p>在國聯理事會開會當日。外相内田康哉所發表談話。即可窺見其整個政策之一般矣。</p>
<p>『……日本帝國政府之承認滿洲國。於現行國際條約之精神。并未有違反之意。且確信此種行爲。乃解决事態之唯一方策。的　總之中國之無政府狀態的國情。爲紛爭發生之導因。日本對滿洲事件之一切行動。又皆立脚於國際正義。而滿洲國之獨立的存在。乃爲不可否定之現實的事實。如能理解此中眞相。則發現解决方案。當不甚難。余且深望其有（解决）之可能性。』於此即已表白日政府對東北問題意見之輪廓。矧内田實爲軍部方面之代言人。至於政治方面。無論政友會民政黨。在協力一致内閣旗幟之下。未見其有若何異議。亦不敢有何異議。蓋軍部之「虎髭。」豈能輕於玩弄。政友會所表示意見。以爲『列國所承認这國際聯盟。應以滿洲之事實爲基礎而求其解决。······』民政黨之意見。則重行聲明『九一八事變。爲日本之自衛行動。調查團認「滿洲國」之成立爲日本人及少數滿洲人之組織。大多數滿洲人實居反對地位。李頓輩之認識。尤爲錯誤。······』其他如國民同盟。如貴族院。之各派所發議論。雖措詞各異。而命意則同。甚至完全相同。如出於一種模型者然。至少亦在軍部命令之下。作一致之言動。</p>
<p>同時復號於其國人之前曰。『具最大之决心。雖國聯以五十六票對日本一票亦所不懼。』且不惜以「退出國聯」作要挾。然則日本果退出國聯乎。吾人已一再詳論之矣。其能成爲退出國聯之事實者蓋鮮矣。㈡日本之異意何在</p>
<p>試細察近數月來日本對東北之一切行動。與夫外交上所運用之政策。即可知之。其間尤以日蘇聯歡爲最顧著。松岡洋右之赴日内瓦也。遵經莫斯科。流連時日竟至一星期。且曾參加十一月革命紀念。以見好於蘇聯。極力求其諒解。對「互不侵犯條約。」欲有條件的締結。雖未必即能取得西比利亞之森林開採權。石油專買。及漁業專利。而中東鐵路彼實欲　爲已有。故松岡浥蘇。其所注意者厥爲此事。同時更欲利用蘇聯在太平洋在歐洲舉足輕重之地位。旣足以抵制美國。復可以威脅英法。且借此取得石油。漁業之實利。無如蘇聯運用其靜觀態度。以松岡之精明强幹。乃如墜五里霧中。往返應酬。殊末見有何巨大之結果。外交秘密。此刻雖尙未探知。而日本之手忙脚亂。則早已在其空虚的誇耀與連續高倡「退出國聯論」見之。</p>
<p>日本之眞態度。其外交書局及軍部。固未明白表示且亦不便露骨表白。以自暴其短半澤五城之力勸國聯持靜觀態度。待日本整理「滿洲」（壓服東北人民。）各大新聞如朝日每日等。亦均持同樣論謂。主張防止且勸告國聯。勿即行對東北問題作决罐。以靜觀主羲遷延時日。則不遠之將來必能求得轉換之策。</p>
<p>㈢延宕政策之必然的趨勢</p>
<p>日閥旣以兵力侵掠東北。又用外交朦蔽世界。則何以尙須延宕耶。蓋日本者非復中日戰爭與日俄戰爭當時靑春時代之日本也。其内含之矛盾。愈加擴張。例如明年度戰時預算之成立。八億九千餘萬公債之發行。亦列入預算表中。實空前之奇異現象。因此。所謂協力一致内閣。政友會與民政當之間。裂痕愈深。日本一般民衆。對此種政治局面深致不滿。於齋藤之軟弱。於高橋之無能。（經軍部一嚇。即投出九千五百圓（日金）以買服軍部而固其權位。）則其内部之危機四伏已可槪見矣。外交方面。彼固仰望美國新總統能一反胡佛政策。則日本尙可從容佈置。然試觀美國傳統外交政策。豈能因總統易人而根本變動。則日本之難題。依然存在。</p>
<p>遍東北各地義勇軍紛起。爭城奪地。與切斷鐵路之事。無日無之彼現以十萬精兵。竟不能充分維持沿鐵路一帶之治安。甚至軍隊安全。亦不克自保。最近乃有對滿增兵兩師之舉。如此匪特不能削平東北義軍。且徒然增加費用。内旣不安。外又多故是以惟有力主延宕。以待國際政局之新轉換。待義勇軍精力疲竭。彼乃放手以收其利。</p>
<p>我國民處此。應奮其所有活力。堅强不屈。對彼日閥作更長期耐久之爭鬭。以征取最後之勝利。</p>

<p>英法决定再請美國停付戰債</p>
<p>麥唐納赫禮歐召集閣議</p>
<p>研究致美政府覆文性質</p>
<h3>戰債與世界經濟之影響</h3>
<p>▲路透社二十七日倫敦電英相麥唐納與財相張伯倫今日趕回倫敦、參加閣員關於美國戰債事件如何答覆之討論、英政府承認現所急需者、在迅速終止目前毫無把握之事態而向美國立即提出理由充足之申請、務使美國依允暫停十二月十五日到期戰債之償付、英相等今夜在唐寗街集議、研究覆文之性質、以便提交星期一日之内閣全體會議、英國新覆文將趕速發出英國可否照付之態度、將視美國覆文决定之、蓋英政府現以爲美國尙未最後拒絕英國緩付之申請也、</p>
<h3>覆文今日可送出</h3>
<p>▲國民社二十七日倫敦電英國對於美國拒絕停付十二月到期戰債後之覆文大約至遲在星期二可以草竣聞復文内將詳細陳述在目前世界經濟狀况下不宜償付之情形、惟英國究竟償付與否、則此時猶未决定、英政府刻正研究此欵支付後、或停付後、世界金融巿場所蒙影響、英相麥唐納·樞密院長包爾温及有關孫數部大臣、特犠牲星期例假、仍與專家多人在唐寗街相邸、討論覆文内容數小時、此外復一面準備各種統計、表示十一月十五日付欵後經濟界將受之影響、以便撮要告知美國、因美國復牒内曾聲稱英國原牒、未曾詳述不得不停止付欵之護據美國未便應允停付故也、聞此項復文、在送往美國以前將先與反對黨領袖如自由黨蕯繆爾及工黨監斯堡等、一爲商榷云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十七日巴黎電現信法國答復美國不允停付戰債之牒文、將於赫禮歐總理赴日内瓦前草竣、其内容據稱將與英國復文相若、赫氏今日又與陸長彭古·財長馬丁、會商戰債及軍縮問題因認政府對於此兩問題之立塲應在渠赴日蚋瓦前决定之故、</p>

<p>▲國民社二十八日雅典電希臘政府已正式通知美國、無力償付下次期債欵四十四萬金元、</p>
<h3>華盛頓要人表示</h3>
<p>▲路透社二十七日紐約電紐約時報稱華盛頓要人表示意見以爲欲變更美國國會現有之不友好態度、則英國關於戰債問題之新覆文、必須提出令人覺悟之理由云、紐講譠報稱倫敦顯有一種樂觀預料十二月付欵、可因新辦法之成立渡過難關、其理由何在、華盛頓官塲殊未能了解之、但現有在廣大陣線上謀取解决之可能性、甚至取銷美國所抱與各個債務國分别辦理、而非與各債務國共</p>
<h3>德工程師研究火箭</h3>
<p>以酒精與氧氣爲發動力</p>
<p>可以乘坐一人試昇天空</p>
<p>▲國民社二十七日麥特堡電德工程師尼培爾、研究火箭、業已多年今日發表、渠將於明春造成一可以乘坐人之火箭乘之試昇天空、届時設能成功、將爲火箭史上空前創舉開一飛行界新紀錄、尼氏希望火箭上昇至三千呎高度後、其中乘客即待降落傘躍下倘試騐成功、則將續製較大火箭、預計可達十三哩之高度、其火箭内、不用火藥係藉酒精與　氣和合之爆發液爲發動力、至歷年製造與研究之費、半由地方當道擔任、半出友人捐助、而此間人民與當道、對於尼氏工作之進步、亦殊注意、前數星期日、常有無數熱心人士往郊外尼氏寓所參觀或聆尼氏講解云</p>
<p>辦理之政策、亦未可知、華盛頓非官塲方面、刻正討論此種陣線之變更云華盛頓有人預料、英國將請美國取銷請求緩付債欵必須於二十九天前通知之辦法、並請美國依允緩付債本、查到期債本、現爲美金三千萬元、據紐約觀察家之考察、法國之决議、殆必視英國爲轉移法國所遇之困難不似英國之在匯兌爲難、但在覓取欸項之匪易因法國預算案現已短少甚鉅也法國大約將於本星期中答覆美國、法國將聲明、如果付欵、亦不行視爲成例法國此次之償付不過持戰債問國之安全解决　、</p>
<h3>俄波不侵犯條約批准</h3>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社二十七日華沙電波蘭與蘇俄間互不侵犯條約及和解公约、頃由波蘭總統以命令批准、按總統批准條約一層、憲法中並未明白規定、而憲法所載、必須由議會批准之各種條約中、自亦未將互不侵犯條約、明白列入波國法學家、以爲必牵涉國家財政、以及强迫國家作某種行動之條約、始須提交議會審查、互不侵犯條約純係一種否定諾言故不在上述條約之列云、按波蘭政府之意、互不侵犯條約、未始不可提交議會、且大多數議員原亦準備將此約通過、但因議員須於星期以後始行開會、而羅馬尼亞與蘇俄談判、一經决裂之後、波蘭官方、即欲將此事從速了結、乃採用總統命令批准之手續云、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十八日華沙電與政府有關之報紙、今日皆發特刋、歡迎俄波互不侵犯條約之最後批准、謂波蘭之國際地位、因此可益鞏固、内有數報、深以羅馬尼亞未與蘇俄締結同式條約爲慽、蓋此舉可使東歐和平益見穏定也、</p>
<h3>德國政治制度</h3>
<p>施萊轍組閣在談判中</p>
<p>聯邦總統之最大使命</p>
<p>希特勒勢力漸趨衰落</p>
<p>▲國民社廿八日柏林電德國繼任總揆人選之呼聲、仍集中于施萊轍將軍一般人咸料、一如現在進行中之新閣與國會休戰談判、若能成功、則施氏之閣揆、在星期一或星期二、即可切實任定、目下　項談判、正在高壓力下、從事進行、擬令國會暫行休會至明年一二月間、施氏並將與天主敎及社會黨工會一談、因施氏果組閣、將集中全力於失業問題、故欲謀政府之穏定、不行不有此兩派工會之擁護也、倘施氏此舉不獲成功、則政局之最後出路、料總統或將再命巴本組閣、而解散新國會云、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社二十七日柏林電吾人於德國最近數日之政局中、得一種甚大之益處、即聯邦總統、在德國政治中所負之最大使命爲何、由此行以明瞭是也、在德國内政混亂之中聯邦大總統爲中流之唯一砥柱、德爲人口六千萬之大國、而其命運乃繫於元首最後之一言、舉國皇皇惟興登堡之馬首是瞻、其情亦可異矣、德國名記者漢斯蔡勒爾之言論、向被視爲代表國防部長施萊轍之意見、渠鑒於興登堡已達八十歲之高齡、甚以此種現象爲憂、興登堡已届風燭殘年、若一旦不起、則國家威權恐將隨之而去將來希脱拉如當選爲聯邦大總統、則不當令其權力、一如興登堡之大、新專權内閣成立之後、其主要任務、即在此點、目下修改憲法、自然已不能談到、蓋欲修改憲法、必須實行「苦迭達」、而興登堡又不願出此手段故也、惟總統選舉法、在寭法上未有規定、則以代法律之命令、即可修改之、關於此層、或者可以一種新法律規定、聯邦總統於任滿以前、或於遺囑中、指定繼任總統之候選人而衆議院亦可以絕對多數、另選一人爲第二候選人、而人民投票選舉新總統時、即就此二人决選之若將總統選舉法如此改正、則立時所能發生之效果、大約如下即除希脱拉黨在衆議院有絕對多數之議席以外、希脱拉决無被衆院推選爲總統候選人之可能、但如希黨在衆院占絕對多數時、則除用武力以外、别無其他法可以阻止希脫拉之執掌政權、目下德國政治上之爭鬥其情形雖不明瞭、然其關係、則甚重大、觀於各方對修改總統選舉法之用心可想見矣、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十八日柏林電昨日白萊門等城鎭各巿舉行巿選舉、中等階級各黨投票者、較近今總選舉增加百分之十、國社黨減百分之二十二、社會民主黨減百分之八、此事雖無大關係、但亦甚可注意云、</p>

<p>▲國民社二十八日丹京電特羅斯基任此間演説、並未攻擊莫斯科執政者、僅盛稱共產政制及其實業之進步、與資本主義國家現狀相較、優劣自判、最後並間接向史丹林提議言和、宣稱渠隨時準備回國、因渠始終欲爲一過激主義者、當演説時、場中未起紛擾、惟釆聲不多、</p>
<p>▲國民社二十八日奥斯陸電挪威内部拒絕特羅資基與其家屬入境、</p>
<p>▲路透社二十八日瑞典京城電特羅資基之遊波維的海諸國、聞已引起蘇俄當軸諸人之惶慮、特羅資基刻在丹麥、擬於十二月内視察倫德大學、查特羅資基所抱之共產主義、與俄國當道所抱者不同、致於一九二八年被驅逐出境、但其勢力猶爲異黨所畏、</p>
<h3>世界棉花收成</h3>
<p>本年爲九年來最少之年</p>
<p>▲國民社二十七日華盛頓電今日美農部發表、本年世界棉花收成、將爲近九年來最少之年、蓋美國植棉畝數旣鋭减於前而埃及棉田停種者尤衆、曾預定减少棉收百分之三十三是以縱有巴西·墨西哥及下印度三處棉收、預估將達四百二十萬包、比前年增八十萬包又中國及波斯產棉亦有增加而估計全世界產額、僅有二千三百四十萬包其中美國收成、將在一千一百萬至千二百萬包之間、查一九二三年世界棉收一千九百十二萬五千包、翌年即驟增至二千三百八十二萬五千包、嗣是過剩日積、棉價鋭落、今乃近九年來第次鋭减去、</p>

<h3>日閥又有進犯平津企圖</h3>
<p>▲藉口蘇炳文事件</p>
<p>▲謂與張學良有關</p>
<p>日報鼓吹擾華北尤力</p>
<p>據大阪朝日新聞載稱、我方（日方）迭與蘇炳文接洽、而蘇炳文拒絕會議、我軍部以興安嶺方面之抗日軍、將有頑强抵抗之勢、對蘇軍將採斷然手段、目下軍部正研究具體的方策、一方爲滿洲里波禁居留民問題、日前關東軍小磯參謀長返京時、曾與軍部愼重協議軍部之意、願犧牲被禁邦人、而外務省心極不忍、仍請軍部商議萬全之策、然目下發生新問題、即蘇炳文部與張學良有聯絡之證、故爲根絕在滿洲反抗各義勇軍起見、對於盤踞北平之張學良、認爲有害滿洲之治安、除先發重大警告外、將直接對華北有進擊之形勢云、</p>
<p>名古屋新聞二十二日發表社論云、據由東京返長春之關東軍小磯參謀長途次朝鮮京城時、對新間記者谈話云、「蘇炳文似無反省之意、和平解决、殆已不可能」、然我軍之當面重大問題、不願犧牲邦人生命、但欲救出邦人頗感困難蓋蘇炳文不顧我方之再四勸告、不應我軍之要求者、罪在張學良何則、在北平之張學良、與北滿之蘇炳文、似皆聯絡、倘蘇炳文無張學良後援彼必不敢長期抵抗、故關東軍方面、不得不將張學良問題解决也、溯　時調查團到華、竟接馬占山之密告、此次國聯討論　頓報告書、又被蘇炳文作梗、此二大計畫的行動、心爲張學良之嗾使無疑、吾人爲謀將來維持滿洲治安計、應有斷然决心之必要當滿洲事變時錦州政府經我軍一擊、張學良之勢力退至山海關以西、今欲解决北滿之治安、我軍不得已、應進擊最後之華北、否則、將來各地恐必有第二第三之馬占山與第二第三之蘇炳文續起、豈能完成滿洲之治安乎、</p>

<p>丨庚洋帮辦胃極貧丨</p>
<p>昨客秈市况北洋停頓南洋大旺到頭續有價乃參碭南洋帮對於　稽胃口向極貪辦乃以爾州泉州兩地最先問津近日以洋米不划辦意更濃、昨日除泉福州外又有汕頭厦門兩帮之繼起爭辦行情陽卽跳漲五六分主近角照　日南帮胃口之濃市面應有拾級上升之必要但以市上有大額洋米存庚外、客秈近日到頭亦多湖南米產價合劃後首可以源源抵申江西米近亦合划、不虞斷擋、來源旣不中斷、市價乃無激漲之實現、　隨到隨消市上亦無大批堆積、昨統市開出湖南機油一千包價八元八角七分八元七角二四分次至八元六角又機紅米六百五十包價八元零五分至七元九角又紅糙一百包、價六九七角、又砶靖五百五十包價元二角七分至七元二角江西機晚八百包、價八元九角至八元六角云、</p>
<h3>期麥俏廲</h3>
<p>丨本月麥交割祇七車丨</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份市、面大致呈堅俏之象、以洋麥　好、現洋麥之　售、近亦見寂、（惟諸傳澳麥散倉貨三兩三錢八分確否未詳）兼之期紛行市、被大廠硬擯、步呈升提、本來小麥來源、近亦不多、故人心遂爲帶起、續果一月份較前日好四分二月份無比較、三月份好四分、四月份爲三分、本月份之交割、數量有限、共祇七車、由元餘鼎麥等交出元和昌收去、聞係華豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>近堅遠平的粉市</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份市面、　近堅遠平之象、以洋麥報價回好一角零、廠家方面、中小廠已人、　望、人廠則因現貨尙緊、　見扳售、故本月份形勢、依然堅俏、羅高　一兩八錢六分、十二及一月份亦見帶起、遠期各月份、初亦堅定惟至下午、因阜　略有抛出、人心復軟、觀最近之趨勢、因金市　責、滙率短縮、一般人以爲洋麥定貨、當受打擊、但國外之物產、如仍過剩、恐亦無人關係也、結果本月份至一月份漲一分、二·三月份漲二厘孚、四月分漲五厘</p>

<h3>絲茶輯里經續有運滬</h3>

<p>輯里經歐美銷路、久難暢達、而產地自新　絲上市後、各絲行咸將新絲交廠、舊搖成經、存絲激增、運河頗不寂寞昨（南潯）（護滭）兩埠、又有乾大經二百四十件、交由小輪裝運來滬、存棧待售云、</p>
<h3>洋莊茶市轉趨沉靜</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊茶市、轉趨沉靜、極關重要之路莊珍眉、去路頗形呆滯、　土莊珍眉珠茶、略有零星交易市盤均趨眨跌貢熙一項、昨市俄國協助會洋行又復開辦、惟進胃不大認價仍低一般条商、對於茶市前途、仍抱悲觀云、</p>
<h3>五金新貨昨到五千餘擔</h3>
<p>（市情一瞥）</p>
<p>昨五金市情、良非互見、客銷比前暢　、故成交二千餘担、購買者多屬青烴　漢諸帮、而　　廣東内河一帶客路前覺冷靜本衛生意如量　帮茶帮等、均形停頓而縣轉市面者祇實用之廠家而亡是以市情表面難尙可差强人意、惟内幕却十分枯燥矣、</p>
<p>（新貨裝到）</p>
<p>昨大古公和祥　棧、均有新貨五金裝到、其數共計有五千六七百担、内係新洋元盤元三角鐵馬口鐵等爲多數、而英　板新路皮白鉛皮等依然無裝到、是以市上仍不免有缺貨之憂也、</p>
<p>（價格變遷）</p>
<p>五金各貨、就目下情形　之、則漲多而跌少、其原由均係市貨淺薄所致、馬口白鉛皮鋼板竹節　白鐵瓦等莫不有步高升之勢、而漲風之最勁者尤嶊屬口鐵爲獨步查其提高之數、則在一二兩之多但交易方面、仍不因貨高而减少其買也、計九十磅英貨估十一兩五錢、聞昨成交有七八百箱、但市貨奇少、後市仍看上風、至於跌風、最近市場中可云十分寥少、除花樹鉛絲綠鐵絲布等冷門花色外、别種殊罕見於場中也、</p>
<p>（定貨一般）</p>
<p>連日市是苦於底貨之單薄、一般購買者往往有青黄不接之憂、故紛紛向洋行購定期貨、聞昨做出亦屬不少、計有馬口鐵英鋼板新路皮大條鉛以及花旗白鐵等七八種云、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢羢街銷旺極</h3>
<p>呢羢厚貨似毡呢·大衣呢·麥爾登·平厚呢·馬褲呢·寛緊·長毛·雙面黄駱駝續等、本街各帮銷場、甚爲暢旺、西服業·大衣作場·門莊家·鞋帼舖子乖咸有相當淮胃、同益會上下午續有開出、售盤頗形穏固、尤以眞屬棕袖裏與馬褲呢二種趨勢更爲俏活云、</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<h3>吳諺考證</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>吳諺的文法是没有專書的，只在心領神會之中。形容時間的吳諺，有時稱頭裏，有時稱頭上。丨上讀作浪下同。</p>
<p>驀然間呌做乍生頭裏，睡夢間呌做困夢頭裏，失意中呌做倒霉頭裏，忙碌間呌做夾忙頭裏；凡是倉卒或不幸的事，都適用這頭裏兩字。</p>
<p>緊要時呌做要緊頭上，交運時呌做運氣頭上，可口時呌做好吃頭上，關鍵時呌做關子頭上，凡是重要或幸運的事，都適用這頭上兩字。</p>
<p>蘇州人口頭油滑，所有相傳的諺語，輾轉誤讀的很多；吾曾從「一聲之轉」的上面，糾正他們的誤點，很想著，卷吳諺糾誤，改正吾鄕的方言，現在先寫幾條在後面：</p>
<p>俗稱事無希望，呌做杳長懞懂；應糾正爲夜長夢多。俗稱事多糾纏，呌做丫割亂經，應糾正爲握葛弄荆。俗稱發生誤會，呌做傳嘴夾中，應糾正爲纏枝絞紐。俗稱散披衣服，呌做散抛散夾，應糾正爲散袍散甲。俗稱暴殄天物，呌做骯髒螞蟻，丨蟻讀作米。應糾正爲骯髒磨滅。　　俗語中喜用「八隻脚」三個字，距離太遠，呌做蕩空八隻脚，人多手雜，呌做七手八隻脚；枝節横生，呌做丫叉八隻脚；丨义讀作搶。凌亂無序，呌做拾柴八隻脚。丨拾讀作習。</p>
<p>拾柴八隻脚的來歷，是從拾柴潑粥四個字輾轉傳誤而來；只爲油嘴滑舌，把拾柴潑粥讀作拾柴八足，字音已纏誤了；誰料，一誤再誤，又從八足兩字，誤解爲八隻脚，於是吳諺裏面，遂有這拾柴八隻脚的五字名詞。</p>
<h3>矛盾的事實</h3>
<p>— 朱戮</p>
<p>「冬季大减價」的市招之下，老的，少的，男的，女的，潮水似的擁擠了三公司和大商塲的各部；銀錢和鈔票，源源地滾進銅梗的櫃檯裏，大大小小的包裏，不絕地挾到那老少男女顧客們的腋下，擁着擠着，在下午三四時後上海商塲裏，那處還找得到「商業不景氣」的現象。</p>
<p>紅綠五色的虹光燈交輝的馬路上，那綴着電石燈的美人鈿車，凉夜如水，風浸肌的午夜，兀自在路上穿梭似的奔走。點點的小電燈，和天空中霎霎的繁星，一樣活躍，一樣繁盛，這盛世的景象，眞是金迷紙醉，那個還能説中國不太平！</p>
<p>「愛國之心，不敢後人」。「經濟絕交，堅持到底。」遍地都是愛國商人的上海，最近偏又有三十萬的劣貨，在上海市塲暢銷了。「天下攘攘，皆爲利往；天下熙熙，皆爲利來。」莫怪血魂團的炸彈，轟不活那班愛國商人的良心哩！「時輪金剛法會」的餘韻才歇，ＸＸ部又在提倡划龍船」的國粹體育運動了。莫怪三北的「高抬閣」，竟得到省政府保護的告示；無錫的「延聖會」，轟動了成萬民衆了。此一時，彼一時，時代的輪齒，不絕地循環推進，安知在這國難時期裏，崑嵛頂上的老神仙，不會翩然下降，請天兵天將來替中華民國殺盡外寇呢。</p>
<p>矛盾的事太多，這樣才會組織成國難儘管國難，恒舞酣歌依然的中華民國。</p>
<h3>影劇的中心思想</h3>
<p>— 修卿</p>
<p>丨需要革命性的刺戟丨</p>
<p>戀愛故事的演述。在現時許多形形色色的影戲片中，差不多已成爲唯一的中心劇材。不論國片西片，有聲無聲，簡直十有七八，跳下出這個圈子　　梅蘭芳今日到滬梅氏此次歷經各界挽約南來，固辭不獲，或將義務表演數日，茲得北平專電，梅氏已由涌車南下，定於今日下午五時半到達北站，並已由黄金榮氏照料一切，論往迎迓云。</p>
<p>。譬如「人獸奇觀」只是一部新聞性的野獸片。但探險家戀愛故事的穿挿，依然是不可缺乏的材料。</p>
<p>本來，戲劇是表演人生有。戀愛在人生過程中，也比較的是最感興趣，最有意味的一節。當然，這是攝製電影唯一的良好劇材了。不過，在每一片中。没有正確高尙的中心思想，專事趨重浪漫香艶肉感的表演。去迎合觀衆低級的心理。這正是現時中西各片很普遍的病　。同時，也可以説是電影事業没落的徴象</p>
<p>尤其，國難期間，在「娱樂不忘救國」的信條之下。大衆所急於需要的，絕對不是那麻醉性的個人享樂主羲的影片；而是具有革命性的激發愛國思想的一類作品。</p>
<p>可是，國產片中這類的出品，委實偶不一見，數量很少。在這裏，我們不能不稱頌最近看過的明星公司鄭正秋先生編導的有聲片「自由之花」了。此片情節，是在演述蔡松坡將軍推翻帝制，再造共和的革命故事。無限愛國血涙，點點映上銀幕。片中描寫爲自由而奮鬥的偉大精神，很有刺戟力量。主角胡蝶女士深刻的表演，更覺情感眞切，宛轉動人。的確，這是一部時代需要的，異乎流俗的影劇啊。</p>
<h3>讀畫偶記</h3>
<p>— 鄧靑城</p>
<p>吾邑前年春，由不佞發起雲溪書畫會，萃合邑書畫家作品五百餘件，假第一公圍開展旬日，極一時之盛。嗣後繼起，遂不乏人，然山水人物及寫意花鳥爲多，面目各具，畫派不同，然要如趙君安之致力二十餘年，自宋元以迨明清諸家，無不撫摹盡致，曲盡其妙，爲下可多觀也。趙君雖邑人，久處於外，精於山水人物翖毛走獸，昔歲全國美術展覽會，及比國理安棋萬國博覽會與賽，皆邀盛譽，獲金獎，故早已名噪海内外。至本月返里，始將大小精品，就公園陳列，不佞得預其盛，尤深偑其工力之難能而可貴也。諸位名流題詠尤多，如况　風先生題天女散花圖，調寄清不樂：衆香國裏，天女非耶是，却被　天靑鳥使，道是萼華仙子。劇憐多病休文，維摩萬一前身，畫　眞眞喚徹，耍他着手成春。褚民誼先生題花鳥書册云：栩栩如生。王一亭先生題云：花香鳥語綴春風，妙筆寫生奪化工，淺綠深紅春色麗，超於象外得環中。朱錫百先生題梅花云：孤山春信到南枝，艶雪濃於桃李姿，和靖先生應一笑，老妻猶喜鬭燕支。不佞亦題所書芙蓉一絕云：傾國名花不耐秋，此花如錦性偏幽，莫嫌遲暮無佳品，却占寒江第一流。餘如錢名山之題桃花繡球跋語，吳鏡予題水仙靑鳥，均極清掦曼妙之致，即安之自題畫幅，亦多佳句，開展三日，覽者雲集，皆欺爲畫風丕振，較之放筆作時下畫者，固不可同日語云。</p>
<h3>死之岔道</h3>
<p>— 范烟橋㈡㈩㈧</p>
<p>這樣的歸宿</p>
<p>東南飯店四百三十六號裡，春風滿面地走出一對璧人來，女的花枝招展似的，貼在男的臂灣裏。男的時時聳起一撮小鬚，在那裡得意得忘形地笑。到電梯口，各换了個方向，對面立着，男的要替女的撩開額上的一綹　末左眼的秀髮，女的把頭廻遇去自已把髮梢捻成了一個小圈，右廻遇來問。（怎樣？男的點點頭説：（好了！）女的又說··「這幾根頭髮，總是燙不好，差不多天天燙，仍舊直苗苗地掛下來。」</p>
<p>電梯來了，送他們倆到六樓，六樓的房間大些，陳設也講究，六百六十六號最富麗，他們倆就走進這一間。茶房是認得愛麗的，濃濃的一笑，什麽都不來問，茶咧，烟咧，他會得送來，等他把門砰的一聲拽上了，男的很急切的問：愛麗你答應我了麽？」愛麗又對着鏡子，做額上有髮圈圈，淡淡的説：怎的如此性急，終身大事，總得考慮的仔細些，是不是？」「慕良！我要問你，這們歡喜女人，難道家裏只有一隻看家的雌狗麽？我不信！」「這個我可以罰咒的，要是我家裏有姨太太，我就·········。」愛麗急忙趕過來，用手掩住他的嘴説：「别説啦！我信你。」趁勢就坐在他的膝上，俯下了頭，看指上的螺紋，慕良把一撮小鬚，凑過去，凑到伊頰上，停住了。愛麗把他一推，立起來，在對而的搖椅裏，坐下，一顚一顚的説着顫動的話：「假使，一個鄉下姑娘，一雄鳥雪似的一個大髮　，兩隻大袖一幌一幌地走來，你願意同伊接一個吻麽？」</p>
<p>慕良格格格格笑起來了，説：「虧你相得出，見了，連隔夜飯也要嘔出來，還有胃口去接吻？」</p>
<p>摩登的頑意兒，都會，甚至要説外國話，都行，那麽你可要厭棄我了？」慕良急辯：「不！决不！總而言之，你已滿足了我的慾望了。」「假使，現在的我，還復到我的本來面目，你怕不要了？」</p>
<p>「你的本來面目怎樣？」</p>
<p>「是一個鄉卜姑娘！」</p>
<p>嗯！··············總而言之，現在我只愛你一個，儘你去變，變，變，變成了一個夜叉，我也愛。」</p>

<h3>賣老</h3>
<p>— 天方</p>
<p>最近幾天報上登着巨幅廣告，據説有一個「曾吃巨大碧桃」的「一百零九歲的長鬚道人」在Ｘ世界内「廣結壽綠」，「任人參見，不售門票」，丨門内的票，這在抱有三多之好的。，一定趨之若鶩。，要求這位「準仙人」指示指示長生秘訣。，或許進一步的拜爲師父。，以便同登不老之域。，這是一個千載難遇的好機會。，</p>
<p>本來這世界小得可憐，殘缺得異樣，短短幾十年的壽命，那能滿足人類的慾望，但要求長生，須入山「修道六十年」却是寂寞不慣，山裏丨苟然不是湯山莫干山的山。，丨又没汽車好坐。，大菜可吃。，這是現代人所不願意到的。，本爲「享樂」而求長壽。，却因想長壽而先「吃苦」這生意意似乎太不上算。，所以入山修道的喜劇。，只有幾個。，「無生路」或傻子去幹。，幾位掦眉吐氣的先生們。，决不會去上當。，現在可好了，承仙人不棄紅塵，下降洋場，費小洋二角，可得長生秘訣，眞最價廉物美。，而且比那死後給子孫發財的保壽險要受用得多。，想來「皓齒」旣可「重生」紅顏自不難長駐，從此「飄飄然」人盡「鬚長三尺。」，滿街都是壽翁。，這倒成了鏡花緣中的「智佳國。」，豈非盛事。，到那時「八十大慶。」，定成笑話，而「千叟宴」亦不足道呢，</p>
<p>但我又想，人生的意羲，决不在於壽命的長短吧，而在對於時代社會。，負多少推進的責任。，倘但求「老而不死。」，這是一個「癖」，説起來實在没有多大意羲的。，所以汪踦國殤，雖天亦壽，而彭祖八百，雖壽亦天，對地球而誇壽命。，實在短暫得可憐。，蟪蛄固不知春秋。，然而字宙的大化。，在人類至今還是一個謎。，故不須間路。，只一步步走着就是。，退一步說，即使一個人活到一百歲，一千。歲。，除了老態可掬。，足供人欣賞外。，還有什麽用呢。，這與故宮博物院理的「古蜚。，」有甚麽分别。，若論本身的價值恐還没有周鼎殷槃值得盜賣吧。，</p>
<p>中國本是一個少年的國家，爲政者大都少年英俊，博學多能，很少耆年老朽，雖也間有長鬚，却從未遇三尺，而且一般心理。，在年未古稀。，便當退老林泉。，優游卒歲。，出任巨艱。，那是後生小子的事。，像德國的大總統保羅興登堡。，以八十五歲的高齡。，尙握全國之權。，日理萬幾。，不知告老還郷。，享幾年清福。，眞是人間第一個大傻瓜。，</p>
<p>唉。，東西文化終隔着一個海洋哩。，</p>

<h3>測音义振動數的新法</h3>
<p>— 芮禹成</p>
<p>讀音學者没有不知道音义的，又没有一個不知道牠的重要。考其重要之點，就因音义類似發原音的棍棒；所夾倍音很少。所以測各種樂器振動數的人，常以音义爲準繩。因此音义振動數的必須精確，是不消説的了。但普通測音义振動數有方法，不外下列幾種；</p>
<p>㈠遞取種種已知振動數的音义，和某义同時振動，測得音之高低相同時，已知的振動數，就是某音义的振動數，　　㈡用賽輪（Ｓｉｒｅｎ）與义并鳴，調節牠的速度，務使與义音的高低一致，由旋轉速度及版上孔數推知某叉的振動數。</p>
<p>㈢圓筒或玻版上塗煤烟感白粉，义端附著很細的針，使針尖和筒或版輕輕接觸，擊义振動後，以等速轉筒或移版，某時間内測得叉所畫的波數，也可推知牠的振動數。</p>
<p>上述三種方法，雖屬耳目并用。但偏於耳的方面居多：最新測法，則重用目而以耳爲輔，且其學理較䆳；故特將</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>申報本埠增刊</p>
<p>他寫了出來，以充同志參考的資料。</p>
<p>㈠取欲測振動數的音义，與弦同時發音；并經過义枝間的空隙，察看弦振動的狀况。如兩種振動數確然相等，則弦往返振動，呈一種迂回遲緩的現象，可以從旁看出來。如兩種稍有不合，絕無此種情形。再調節弦的長短及張力，務使這現象十分明顯，然後用弦振動數公式，算出弦的振動數，就是音义的振動數。</p>
<p>㈡接賽輪版於旋轉器，以等速旋轉牠，并將音叉置放版前，可經過义枝間以視版的一部分；如兩種所發的音的振動數確係相等，則版上的圓孔，似乎靜止不轉；倘使稍有差異，則圓孔就彷佛很緩墁地或向後退或向前進，至其進退的速度，因兩個振動數的相差而不同。因此知道：如調節賽輪使生上述的現象後，再用賽輪計算法，求其振動數，就得音义的振動數了。</p>
<p>㈢取欲測動數有音义，與已知振動數的音义，使其叉枝直平行··第二音义之後，再置一個燭火。擊動二义使牠發音，以隻眼從二义之隙觀察火燄··如兩種振動數確相等，則火燄時隠時現，皆有一定節拍；如稍有差異，則光的隠現便不能合拍了；甚或混淆不能灼見。所以如用各义試騐，至發生規律之現象時爲止。則已知者有振動數，就是未知者的振動數。</p>
<p>上述三種新法，可以視力矯正聽覺的錯誤；因爲聴力往往辨細微之差别，學者非用多法測騐，參照比較，不能得到精確之結果的！</p>

<h3>一封信</h3>
<p>— 采玄</p>
<p>我底靈；</p>
<p>彷佛天半的游絲似地，你孤零地又漂泊到遼遠的羊城，對於你底飄流，爲妻的你底嬋本來是應當予你以深深的安慰與同情的，然而，你底嬋没有這樣，而且不唯不曾因你底遠離感到寂寞過，反而學到安靜得多了！</p>
<p>我底靈！你讀了這幾句話，你是無須怨惱’同時也無須悲哀’因爲不能諱言地’事實上我們已不像當我們底戀愛時期的火一般地熱愛’我們是一天天地疎遠起來’隔膜起來了！</p>
<p>自從我們有了可愛而又可憐的英兒以後，爲了種種原由，就構成了我們之間的疎遠和隔膜的開始。這疎遠和隔膜漸漸地滋長着，你底嬋也漸漸地消失了對於你底平素的熱愛，而有點憎惡你了！爲着這我常把掁已緘默著，珍藏起我底笑容，凄悉著我底面顏不高興和你談話，而且時常無端地會爲了一點微細的事情而怨咒你，最後又嘤嘤地對你哭泣了！至於你呢？啊，可憐的靈，你看了我底反常的對待你底態度，你彷彿也在深深地苦悶着，然而你却没有像往昔在我憤怒的時候那樣所加我以温柔的慰安與詢問，你祇是沈默著，這證明你也萌茁着憎厭我底心了！尤其是當我們默然睡在牀上的時候，我總是厲色地拒絕你對我底生理上的要求，這樣更增加了你底惱怒，而常把一般無處可發的氣洩在可憐的孤寒的，你平素所深愛的英兒身上。於是，在這樣的情形下，没有快樂，没有懽笑，一切都呈現著秋底沉鬰的氣象，我們從前所共認爲幸福的家庭，就變作苦痛的家庭了！</p>
<p>親愛底靈，爲著我們底感情有破裂，我是感到非常痛苦，非常傷心的！因此，我常會流著我底眼涙凄凄地因憶起我們底過去的生活的甜密和美滿來，而現在，唉，眞是不堪回首，不堪回首啊！</p>
<p>　還深深地記得當我在花樣的靑春底處女時代，爲一種天賦的熱的靑春底活力使我不能自制會憧憬著一個英俊的愛人。後來，我終於認識你了，我感到幸福，在那時我眞是深愛著你底！不久經過了多少有艱難，我們才能在舊家庭的鐵蹄下掙扎起來結了婚。然而過着這般幸福生活不到一年，事實上我們都有些感到平凡了；不過，那時候我們還希望著有一個可愛的孩子來調劑我們底平凡枯寂的生活；然而我失望了，當我生育了英兒以後，孩了有啼聲，家事有紛繁，···這一切更使我由平凡感到厭惡！同時漸漸地我覺得你不像從前那樣的可愛了！凡你的一切在在都會惹起我底不滿和惡感。因此，我們就疎遠起來，隔膜起來，造成了這個不可收拾的不幸的局面。</p>
<p>現在呢？爲著生活的原故你又孤寒地漂泊到遼遠的羊城了，雖然我没有加你以安慰和同情，但我底心在幾年的夫婦底情感上我仍是愛着你的！我們還年靑，以後同居的歲月還多着，希望我們都能竭力地使自已復燃起愛底死灰，不要再把這個不祥的局面繼續下去。是的，我底靈，我愛你，我還深愛你底；你也瞭解我，你也深愛我吧！</p>
<p>英兒近來更有趣更伶俐更活潑了，請不要掛念！你底婵。</p>
<h3>隨筆</h3>
<p>— 無畏</p>
<p>要是你底秘密有二個人以上知道，那麽你底秘密一定會不能再保守下去，因爲人嘴是紮不住的呢！</p>
<p>你不要以爲一個殘廢了的；或是身體不健全的人，是完全没用底一個，因爲一個殘廢了的人；總比埋在泥土裏的死屍有用呢！</p>
<p>要是你要讚一個人，或是一件東西，最好是在他一切完了後，所謂蓋棺論定，因爲一切非到臨了其間底變化是不停的，而誰也不能預先料定。</p>
<p>人生底幸福不是金錢，是健康的體格，無失德的一生。</p>

<h3>病中的她</h3>
<p>— 孌雪</p>
<p>這是一個初冬的雨夜，寒風呼呼地在屋外咆哮，雨打着玻窗淅瀝作聲，室内沉寂得和死去一樣，一切人們都在追尋他們的好夢，惟有病着的她，這時却清醒着，她那慘白的臉色，急促的呼吸，深陷而無光的眼睛，一望而知是個病入膏盲的人了。</p>
<p>她時常昏昏迷迷失知覺地睡着，知道自已離死不遠了，但她並不恐怖，也不悲傷，因爲所受的刺激太深了，她希望死神的早臨，她便脱離了痛苦，與這吃人的社會永别了。她兩眼望着帳頂，憧憬她着過去的一切！夢一般的人生，微弱的心靈中，頓起無限的感想。</p>
<p>多麽美麗的童年時，慈藹的祖母，親愛的父親和母親，她們對她是多麽珍愛，那時她好如一位快樂天使，無憂無愁地過着快樂的日子。但曾幾何時，祖母死了，父親也竟一病不起，惡的命運便從此開始了。哥嫂爲了自私，促着母親把她配人，母親也希望她早得安身之所，以了宿願，常言「父死兄爲長」她也由不得自主，從此她便消失了自由，犧牲了一生的幸福。</p>
<p>姑的惡辣，丈夫的無良，幾年來的奴婢生活，使她受盡多少磨折，多少苦痛，幾次三番想自殺，但一想起年老的母親，恐苦懐了身子，使她没勇氣自殺。在不久之前，產了個男孩，不幸因爲先天不足，不幾天就天了，而她此後的待遇更不堪設想了；平時受創已深的心靈，那再經得起產後有摧殘。</p>
<p>她想起童年的幸福，少女時代的可愛，而今一切都完了，靑春早已消逝了，活躍的心靈也早已死去了，就這僅存的一息，還彌留着受苦痛，啊！誰使她如此？誰之咎？誰之咎······</p>
<p>雨淅瀝地在哭泣，風呼呼地像爲她不平，她的意識，便在這風嘯雨聲中漸漸地模糊了。</p>

<h3>怎麽樣才算爲一個「演員」</h3>
<p>— 艾</p>
<p>演員是多麽便當啊，只要會笑會哭就行了嗎？不，不，决不止這樣。</p>
<p>演員可以分爲兩種，一種是傀儡式的演員，一種是具有靈魂的演員。什麽呌做傀儡式的演員？一個演員對於他或她自已所演的劇本根本是隔膜的，連自已所演的人物，是什麽階級，什麽環境，什麽個性，一點也不明晰，祇是聽着導演的指揮，臨時做了一個天才的傀儡。具有靈魂的演員，他們不但對於所飾的劇中人有相當的認識，並且很清晰的明瞭整個的劇本，及所有劇中人的個性：一個導演自然比一個演員的事務繁雜到不止十倍之多，所以有時不免有顧不到的地方，這責任是每演員盡的，這樣一個演員非要具有靈魂不可，具有靈魂的才成爲一個演員</p>
<p>我雖然知道一個演員是具有靈魂，所以我努力去認識社會與劇中的一切，但這眞是一件難事，我不能負担起我底責任！演員的責任。</p>
<p>我曾寫了一個劇本，我希望在我自已的劇本中能使我漸成爲一個演員。極可笑的是説我寫的劇本無異爲我自已寫照，我眞不知道以後我有多少事實可寫；現在我正着手寫第二個劇本，還有兩個劇本尙在打腹稿。</p>
<p>閲者意見</p>
<h3>關於有聲影片的字幕</h3>
<p>— 翊烈</p>
<p>注意動作，减少幕字</p>
<p>現代中國有聲電影不能得到良好的成績，我們應該原諒它的，因爲有聲電影在中國還是初出胎的陔子呢！所以攝影的技巧及各種經騐當然不能同老大哥的美國好萊塢相比。</p>
<p>我就拿現代中國的聲電影的字幕來談談吧。</p>
<p>先説外國的有聲影片，除了開頭出片的公司及導演同演員······等等的姓名外，字幕是很少很少看到的。只有劇情極其曲折的地方，才寫了幾個字幕説明而已！</p>
<p>説到我們的中國有聲影片，除了頭段不可缺少公司演員名字字幕之外，往往在表現正劇的當中加上許多字幕，説明未表現出來的動作和事實，這眞是畫蛇添脚，觀衆看了非但感不到興趣，而且覺得討厭，一點没有回味可尋。就拿最近天一代表作「蘭谷萍踪」來説。當中就有許多畫蛇添脚的地方，如「是夜」「金慧蘭的家庭」「應啓貴的家庭」······等都是使觀衆看討厭的多了的字幕。</p>
<p>導演添了許多字幕進去的用意，是爲了觀衆看不懂劇情的意思而説明它；這是導演猜錯了，觀衆看影片的程度未必同導演所想那樣淺薄吧！而且也可以用對白或多攝些片子來表示的。</p>
<p>卓别林演的都是默片，但他説明的字幕是非常的少，極力避了許多不要緊的字幕，然而看過它的人，没有一個不懂的，這當然是他的動作能代替説明而表現出劇情來。</p>
<p>有聲電影是以動作同言語表現劇情，字幕本當可以省了。</p>
<p>所以有聲片應該避了許多畫蛇添脚的字幕，就是在默片裏能減少字幕，而注意動作的表現代替字幕，那樣片子看了才有興趣有回味。質之中國導演先生，以爲然否？</p>
<h3>你要搜，就搜罷</h3>

<p>隨便談談</p>
<h3>國片中滑稽片的缺乏（一）</h3>
<p>— 島生</p>
<p>由蘇俄「笑之總動員」而聯想到國產影片中滑稽片的缺乏。</p>
<p>滑稽影片之使人心花怒放，解顏忘憂；憂者以喜，樂者更樂。「笑」之有益於身心，也早有定論。然而，試一檢點國產影片，其中盡是些武俠片，神怪片，社會片和艶情片：滑稽片則如鳳毛麟角。所謂「癩蟆想吃天鵝肉」，與最近中央開映的「鷄鴨夫妻」而已。導演先生們對於滑稽片，似乎有不屑爲有神情。</p>
<p>還有，外國片中，即是非滑稽片，也時有滑稽的穿挿，每使觀衆哄堂大笑，以提起觀衆精神。國產片裏，對於這一層，似乎也没有注意到。</p>
<p>鑒於外國笑片之源源輸入·國人經營的影片公司其亦猛醒乎？</p>
<h3>（二）看了鷄鴨夫妻之後</h3>
<p>— 顧不問</p>
<p>前天中央大戲院，大發其傳單，大登其廣告，原來是爲了劉春山的「鷄鴨夫妻」，在滬開映，不惜宣傳，説什麽：「卓别麟的勁敵」「驚（原文如此）告羅克覺悟」「　司開登聽見冷面亦會笑三笑」「勞利哈特急得不敢賴糊調」，這種標語，外加影片的題名是：「鷄鴨夫妻」，顧名思義，想來一定是滑稽透頂得了，於是引動了我這個二角頭小影戯院的顧客，不問三七二十一，不得不忍痛升格，前去忝附四角頭的驥尾，（中略）</p>
<p>我看了這兩種中國滑稽影片以後，覽得我們抵制卓别麟，尙没有勁敵出現，也不足以警告羅克的覺悟，裴司開登看了，亦許含有諷的冷笑三下，勞利哈特，或許看了一懂也不懂·總之滑稽的表情，不一定要採取　脚戲式的，原來人們的小動作形態措置上，都有合理的滑稽現狀·不必窮凶極惡，胡閙發狂，奔逐跳躍，以博觀客一笑而止，毫無回想的價値，這就是我對於中國滑稽影片的忠告·</p>
<h3>（三）對於國產滑稽片前途之感想</h3>
<p>— 星宿</p>
<p>滑稽影片自有滑稽影片的藝術，和立塲，决不是簡單地令人發笑就是了。牠能比其他影片更進一層的，刺到社會或是人類的深處去。滑稽影片的所以不容易表演，和不容易攝製得使人滿意，這是個確切的理由了。（中略）</p>
<p>對於這部「雞鴨夫妻」的表演，多少終得予以原諒，這一般演員們，多是慣在舞臺上賣唱，在開麥拉前工作，委實還是第一遭，都缺乏經騐，庛點百出。導演和攝影的技術，也太惡劣，劇本還是和其他已經失敗的滑稽片相同，不脱近於胡閙和荒唐的劣惡。直會得使人寒心，看了這部「雞鴨夫妻」以後，想到的國產滑稽片的前途。但我希望他們一再不斷的努力！（下略）</p>
<p>明星小史</p>
<h3>泰露拉彭海幼年小史（下）</h3>
<p>— 梅村</p>
<p>一天，她金黄色的頭髮，紮成了小辫子，呼吸很憁促的跑進屋子裏，她的祖父母説：「我將來長大了，想做一個戲子」。她聽明的伯母，不和她爭辯她的不是；隨機應變，放任她任好奇心的發展，所以泰露拉就常常綀習嫋娜的姿態，要想長大了好預備去做明星。</p>
<p>不過，她仍怕祖父母的嚴緊的管束，因此時常想用個計策，來脱離這可厭的家庭。她終於相得了，好和幽近妮偷跑出去，到華成頓丨美國的首都丨地方的一個修道院裡，她們就送在聖道書院裡讀書。在這書院裡，她是一個最美麗的女孩。</p>
<p>她闊了這個頑皮的巴戲後，恐被姊妹們去報告她的家裡，所以她寫就了一封長的虔誠的信，去寄給她的祖父母，説她願意做一個尼姑，永遠住在修道院裡。到十四歲，泰露拉畢業了。</p>
<p>她説：我所受的敎育，眞可笑極了。我只捒我最歡喜的凡啞拿學習，對於算術呢，最不耐煩，這簡直糟塌時間啦。</p>
<p>泰露拉十七歲的時候，在華盛頓初次登臺。不過她的父親彭海已經作了議員，所以希望他美麗的女兒，仍繼續過她以前可愛的交際生活，可是泰露拉終不願意。</p>
<p>她未到華盛頓以前，在她的故鄉，有一次，她把自已的照片，私自送到一個美女竸選會裡去，揭曉那天，在雜誌上看見刋出她的像片，底下註一個「？」記號，這因爲她要守着秘密，所以送去的時候，没有塡她的名字，這是她幼年最奮興的一天。　　竸選會，她竟已獲勝了；關於她將來的各種要務，也因此决定了。</p>
<p>她拿了雜誌，一脚跑到家裡，氣喘喘的翻出書來，給家裡人看，還説，她想再登到舞臺上去試一試，這是一九一八年的事，她年紀是十六歲。她雖决定去做女伶，可是她家屬的觀念，因泰露拉離去了，使她們感到寂寞，都不以爲然。</p>
<p>泰露拉的父親在幼年時候，也有做伶人的意想，但是終於被他的雙親説服了去攻讀法律。現在對他美麗的女兒，始終想不出方法來移轉她的意志。</p>
<p>照上面看來，泰露拉要做明星的觀念，早已在她幼年時代養成了。加以不怕瑕境的阻礙，纔能得到現在的地位，眞不是一件偶然的事。她今年已三十歲了。她奮鬭的精神，也随年齡而繼續增長。如果馬連黛脱麗在今年十二月的合同滿後，而要回袓國的話，那末明年派拉蒙的影后寳座，泰露拉很有奪得的可能。一有志者事竟成」，這也是一個明證。（完）</p>

<h3>由憤怒轉變到警懼</h3>
<p>表情獨習法第三式就是由憤怒轉到警懼。我們的獨法第一式，由模糊轉變到注意，眼眶已經張大得多了。第二式由注意轉變到憤怒，眼眶又加大了一倍，現在練第三式，就是把憤怒的瞪目逐漸的加大，大到無可再大的地步，逼住了一口氣，連嘴都閉不攏來，這就是驚慌到了極度的表現，也就是眼眶張到極度的表情。</p>
<p>大凡一個人突然遇到了非常可怕的現象，自已稍微還有一點抵抗能力的時候，眼眶自然便會突然的放大。這是自衛的本能正當的表現，但是到了無法抵抗或是無力抵抗的時候，眼眶却會突然閉攏來。你看兒童在游戲的時候。突　　然傾跌，他的眼睛便會閉得很緊，髣髭是怕死或是等死的樣子。</p>
<p>第三式的綀習法和前兩式相彷。先把眼睛變成憤怒的狀態，然後殷進一口氣去，恰恰數完八個數目字，眼眶逐漸張大轉變到驚懼的狀態，同時口腔也漸漸放大到張口結舌的狀態，保留住這一口氣并且維持住這個狀態，心中默數一一、二、三、四、五、六、七、八。』然後在呼出這口氣的時候，把眼眶和口腔漸漸收小，回到注意的狀態，在呼出這一口氣的時候，也是照前樣從『一』默數到『八』字。</p>

<h3>Preventing Man-Made Disasters</h3>
<p>Please Quickly Join the Monthly Donation Campaign to Save Northeast China, Jehol, China, and Humanity Worldwide</p>
<p>Respectfully Announced by the Shanghai Northeast China Refugee Relief Association</p>
<p>Of all the sufferings in the world, none is greater than that of refugees. Refugees suffer from having no shelter, no food, no clothing, and they wander about seeking survival. Charitable people often exhaust their love of human mutual aid to save them. Today, the refugees in Northeast China not only have no shelter, no food, no clothing, but they also cannot wander about seeking survival. The disaster of man-made calamities is greater than natural disasters. The pursuit by airplanes and artillery fire is relentless and without end. The more people wander about, the larger the scope of the disaster caused by this pursuit. Therefore, the Northeast China refugees, courageous in upholding justice, have no choice but to risk their lives to fight against the pursuing airplanes and artillery fire, fulfilling their responsibility to defend the country's territory and their righteous duty to save the world.</p>
<p>Today, the scourge of man-made disasters has spread throughout the three northeastern provinces. If there were no refugees upholding justice to resist it, the man-made disaster, worse than floods and fierce beasts, would have already entered the critically endangered Jehol, spread to all of China, or even run rampant and bring the same disaster to other countries. If we want to prevent Jehol from becoming another Northeast China, and to prevent our fellow countrymen and other people from becoming another group of Northeast China refugees, we must do our best to help the Northeast China refugees who are upholding justice, and provide long-term assistance to the Northeast China refugees who are upholding justice.</p>
<p>Doing our best to help the Northeast China refugees who are upholding justice and providing long-term assistance to the Northeast China refugees who are upholding justice can prevent the expansion of the scope of man-made disasters and the ability of man-made disasters to cause harm. In other words, it is to save Northeast China, Jehol, China, and all of humanity in the world.</p>
<p>Compatriots in Shanghai, compatriots across the country, and compatriots overseas, do not sit idly by and let the Northeast China refugees upholding justice bear the responsibility of protecting the country alone and fulfilling the duty of saving the dying alone. We should rise up together and commit to monthly donations to increase the strength of long-term assistance.</p>
<p>Respectfully Announced by the Shanghai Northeast China Refugee Relief Association</p>

<h3>Japanese Representative Opposes Applying Article Fifteen and Abandons Voting; Administrative Council Meeting Closed Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Nineteen-Member Committee Will Convene on the First of Next Month to Further Determine the Date of the General Assembly</p>
<p>Representatives of Small Countries Actively Participate in Speaking; American Attitude is Worth Watching</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a meeting this morning, lasting only ten minutes. It decided to submit the Sino-Japanese issue to a special meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly. British Foreign Secretary Simon had returned to London, so the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Eden, represented Britain. After the meeting began, Chairman Valera read a letter from the Japanese representative Matsuoka, briefly stating the instructions he had received from the Tokyo government, saying that Japan maintained its reservation regarding Article Fifteen of the Covenant concerning the transfer of this issue to the General Assembly, and therefore refused to vote. All the representatives present were unwilling to express their opinions or ask any questions, so the Chairman announced the suspension of discussions. Thus, the proposal to submit this matter to the General Assembly in accordance with Article Fifteen of the Covenant was passed. The Chairman expressed his thanks to the members of the Lytton Commission for their assistance, and said that if the special meeting needed their assistance, they would still be asked to attend. The Japanese representative Matsuoka raised a reservation to this, arguing that Japan considered the work of the Commission to be completed. This reservation has been recorded, and the meeting was adjourned. (Reuters, 28th) (Geneva) Now that the Sino-Japanese issue has been submitted to the General Assembly, the future trends are being speculated upon. Various suggestions have resurfaced. The idea of ​​convening a meeting outside the League of Nations, gathering the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty to participate, has not yet been abandoned. At the same time, some suggest inviting the United States and Russia to join the Nineteen-Member Special Committee, focusing its efforts on the reconciliation procedures under Article Fifteen, Paragraph Three of the League of Nations Covenant. This article states:</p>
<p>"The Council shall endeavor to effect a settlement of the dispute, and if successful, shall make public a statement of the facts of the dispute and of its recommendations as to the terms of settlement."</p>
<p>Others have suggested limiting the Nineteen-Member Special Committee to handle this matter within sixty days. If it is ineffective by the deadline, the General Assembly should consider what actions are necessary thereafter in accordance with Article Fifteen, Paragraph Four of the Covenant. Paragraph Four states:</p>
<p>"If the dispute is not so settled, the Council either unanimously or by a majority vote shall make and publish a report containing a statement of the facts of the dispute and the recommendations which are deemed just and proper by the Council." Unfortunately, both of the above plans depend on the participation of the United States and Russia. Given the current situation, it seems that both countries are unwilling to share the responsibility of the League of Nations. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations has the authority to convene the General Assembly. Today, he has contacted the President of the General Assembly, Hymans, regarding the date of the meeting. It is estimated that the meeting will have to be held around December 5th or 6th. The Nineteen-Member Special Committee, chaired by Hymans, is scheduled to meet on Thursday. At that time, the convocation of the General Assembly can be acknowledged. It is expected that the general discussion of the General Assembly will take about a week or ten days. Those who have reported to speak include the South African representative Valera, the Czech representative Beneš, and the Spanish representative Madariaga. In addition, those expected to speak include representatives from Sweden, Norway, several South American countries, and representatives from Britain, France, and Italy. The debate will likely be limited to matters of principle, allowing countries to express their attitudes on major issues such as the Lytton Report and whether the League of Nations Covenant has been violated. This discussion can allow the United States to see the League of Nations' stance and thus determine its attitude. Although the United States now believes this is a League of Nations affair and is unwilling to share its burden, it is widely believed that once the United States understands that the League of Nations is truly prepared to handle this case, it may be possible for it to provide the League of Nations with some cooperation. In short, the trend of the General Assembly discussion, especially the General Assembly's reaffirmation of the principles of the League of Nations, will satisfy the United States. Then the United States can abandon its current bystander attitude and agree to cooperate. After the general discussion of the General Assembly concludes in the future, the Nineteen-Member Special Committee may be tasked with summarizing the debate and preparing a report or resolution. At the same time, mediation will continue to proceed in accordance with the planned method. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Lord Lytton stated, "I will depart for London tonight. If the League of Nations General Assembly needs to inquire about anything in the future, I will return here immediately." Now other members of the commission will also return to their respective countries. Only the American member McCoy will stay in Europe temporarily, and will return to the United States after it is confirmed that the League of Nations General Assembly does not need him.

<h3>Our Country Firmly Opposes</h3>
<p>Damage to the Integrity of Our Territorial Sovereignty</p>
<p>Only a Speculation in Geneva</p>
<p>The League of Nations Will Never Adopt This Method</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news on the 27th speculated on the trends of the League of Nations General Assembly, saying that it would require China to protect Japanese interests in Manchuria under the supervision of the League of Nations, and would organize an international administrative and military commission to supervise Manchurian administration and determine when Japanese interests had been adequately protected, at which point the Japanese army should withdraw from Manchuria. Officials believe that this is only a speculation in Geneva, and believe that the League of Nations General Assembly will never adopt this method, which China will swear to oppose with all its might, because this plan damages the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and is completely contrary to the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan Fears Small Countries Extending Justice</h3>
<p>Efforts to Win Over Offer Little Hope</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There are no new developments in the reactions of the Japanese people here to Geneva. Newspapers continue to criticize the actions of the League of Nations Administrative Council, saying that it did not seek a solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute but transferred it to the General Assembly, obviously wanting to shirk responsibility. Officials say that if the League of Nations believes that Japan is prepared to change its fundamental position regarding the independence of "Manchukuo," it is seriously mistaken. As for the general public, they strongly oppose any suggestion that would treat Japan as a criminal in a court of law, because the countries, especially the small countries, will become judges. What they care about are abstract theories and how the verdict will affect their own interests. As for the true interests of the Manchurian issue, they are not considered. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry received a report from its representative office in Geneva stating that after the letter was submitted to the Speaker on the 27th, the small countries' feelings towards Japan worsened, and conflicts were feared to be unavoidable in the General Assembly. The Japanese government ordered Representative Matsuoka to use the time before the General Assembly to try to win over the small countries and seek to change and moderate their attitudes, but there is little hope for the future. (China United Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japan Opposes Intervention by Third Countries</h3>
<p>Deeply Fears the Increased Pressure from the Participation of the United States and Russia</p>
<p>Japanese Telegram Reports are Considering a Private Settlement</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations Secretariat knows well that although the Sino-Japanese dispute has been transferred to the General Assembly, it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain a satisfactory resolution. Therefore, regarding the order after the General Assembly, it is now preparing a plan for an international political conference including the United States and Russia, intending to entrust the resolution of the issue to that conference. This morning, the Foreign Ministry received this information. Based on the following arguments, the Imperial Government resolutely opposes it and is awaiting instructions from the representative office: ㈠ Because China's territory has split itself, the independent "Manchukuo" is outside the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty. The Empire's actions do not violate the treaty, so there is no need to open an international conference based on the treaty. ㈠ Any conference related to "Manchukuo" must be based on the demands of "Manchukuo" itself. In particular, an international conference involving Soviet Russia, with surrounding countries supporting it, is truly disregarding the sovereignty of "Manchukuo." ㈠ The only international conference that the Imperial Government can accept is the international cooperation conference案 for building a solid central government in China, based on the conclusions of the Lytton Report. The Empire's established policy of refusing the participation of third countries in the Manchurian issue will not be changed under any circumstances. ㈠ In short, the intention of the League of Nations to use the cooperation of the United States and Russia to strongly pressure Japan is very clear, but the Imperial Government absolutely opposes this plan. (Den Tsushin, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Sino-Japanese dispute in the League of Nations will indeed be transferred to the Provisional General Assembly today. The Japanese government has decided on a policy. If the League of Nations General Assembly disregards Japan's claims, denies the independence of "Manchukuo," or resolves to form a so-called "Manchukuo Unrecognized League," the Japanese representative will not hesitate to withdraw. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will not only lose face, but it will also cause a great shock in Europe among countries that hope to withdraw from the League of Nations, and the League of Nations will inevitably fall into a dead end. Therefore, it is believed that as a result of various discussions at the Provisional General Assembly, it will consider a solution that can maintain the face of both China and Japan and the League of Nations. Regarding the proposal, if the League of Nations hopes, the Japanese representative is also prepared to submit a private settlement proposal to assist the League of Nations. The main points of the settlement proposal currently being considered by Japan are said to include the following: ㈠ The League of Nations should encourage both China and Japan to negotiate directly on the Manchurian issue and adjust the specific settlement plan. ㈠ Direct negotiations should be conducted to ensure peace in the Far East and take necessary joint actions. ㈠ Restore friendly relations between China and Japan and quickly adjust diplomatic relations. ㈠ Ensure respect for the spirit of treaties related to Sino-Japanese relations, such as the Washington Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.

<h3>Davis's Talk on the Manchurian Case</h3>
<p>The United States Declares It is of a Private Nature</p>
<p>The New York Times reports that the Washington State Department spokesperson stated that if Davis conducts talks in Geneva regarding the Lytton Report and the League of Nations' consideration, it is his private and unofficial behavior. The United States has not made an official statement. Davis's trip to Europe is specifically for the World Economic Conference and the Disarmament Conference. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Is Britain Compromising with Japan to Protect Its Own Interests?</h3>
<p>So Reports a Japanese Telegram</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Geneva, the most important opinion regarding the Sino-Japanese issue in the League of Nations is the opinion of Britain. The British representative in Geneva maintains a very cautious attitude and avoids expressing opinions. Recently, summarizing various information, it seems that Britain will recognize Japan's position and decide to compromise with Japan. The reasons are as follows: ㈠ Britain has never done anything that it intends to leave. Moreover, Britain gradually understands that in the current situation, if it disregards Japan's position, it will suffer itself. ㈡ Britain is extremely afraid of the red scare in India. When Representative Matsuoka stayed in Moscow, the British were very worried about this matter, which had a significant impact on Britain's attitude towards Japan. This issue also has the same impact on France, which owns Vietnam, and the Netherlands, which owns the Dutch East Indies. ㈢ The League of Nations may decide to take any action against Japan, but it is now unable to change the current situation in Manchuria. It is better to compromise with Japan and ensure its rights and interests in China. ㈣ The reason why Britain supported the transfer of the agenda to the General Assembly in the Council seems to be to convene a General Assembly discussion to maintain the League of Nations and the face of the small countries, so this is just a means. (Nichi Ren, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Simon declared in the House of Commons today that the resolution of the League of Nations Administrative Council to submit the Lytton Report to the General Assembly was fully approved by the British delegation.

<h3>The Embassy in the United States Issues a Telegram from Leaders of the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Which Arouses Considerable Attention from Americans</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the Chinese Embassy issued a joint telegram from Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and fifteen other leaders of the Northeast Volunteer Army, announcing that the puppet organization is completely a Japanese puppet and vowing to wipe it out. The Americans are paying close attention to this. Furthermore, because the Japanese have recently spread rumors in the United States, falsely claiming that General Ma Zhanshan was killed in action, many Americans believed it. Now that they see Mr. Ma personally leading the telegram, they are paying even more attention. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>

<h3>Public Notice No. from the Upper Bao Sha Tian Property Bureau</h3>
<p>It is hereby known that the Sha Tian official property has long been clearly designated as state-owned, and a notice has been issued. Recently, it has been found that people often deliberately use tricks to directly exchange land and report business licenses without following the regulations, which harms the income of state-owned land and is extremely regrettable. Therefore, this bureau has drafted measures to stop this and submitted them to the hall for forwarding to the ministry, as well as to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the First and Second District Courts and the District Court. If there are any of the above-mentioned lawsuits that have not been issued a ministry certificate, they will be deemed to have not obtained property rights. Now, the Finance Hall has issued instructions to forward them separately for strict prohibition, and has also sent a letter to the Shanghai Special District Court and the District Court for investigation and handling. At the same time, the bureau will announce the above-mentioned situation and publish it in the newspaper for general knowledge. Hereby, all businesses are hereby notified that in the future, they shall not exchange land business licenses or secretly transfer perpetual lease deeds for overflow land without grain or bills, beach photos without supplementing the field price, or official docks without being issued ministry certificates without authorization. Violators will be fined double. Those who report the crime will be rewarded with half of the fine to encourage and warn future generations. In addition to the public notice, I am afraid that it is not fully known, so I will publish it again in the newspaper for general knowledge.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Shells Rural Villages in the Sanbaoyingzi Area</h3>
<p>Jehol Army Defends Koubeiyingzi</p>
<p>Wang Fengge's Troops Occupy Chaoyangzhen and Shahekou</p>
<h3>Righteous Army Recaptures Hanjia Gou</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to transportation circles, the Japanese army occupying Nanling, under the pretext of discovering the righteous army in the Sanbaoyingzi area, has been shelling various villages with artillery for days. The villagers have fled empty-handed, and many rural houses have been destroyed. Japanese armored vehicles have driven from Yixian County to Nanling, intending to show off their power. Our army is defending Koubeiyingzi, calmly watching its movements. Meng Zhao, under the order of Fengtian's Tang Yulin, has gone from Jianping to Chaoyang to comfort the stationed troops. The righteous army led by Wu Xingzhou, with more than 400 men, attacked Hanjia Gou, east of Xingcheng, on the evening of the 27th, killing three puppet police officers and one postal worker, and occupied the area. The Japanese sent 100 troops from Xingcheng to assist, and the battle situation is unclear. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Righteous Army Abandon Kangping County Seat</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a person from Zhangwu, the National Salvation Army led by Jia Bingyi and Gao Wenbin's troops have been stationed in Kangping County, Liaobei, and Tongjiangkou, Jinjiatun, and Faku in Changtu County for three months. The Japanese army originally planned to attack Su Bingwen and Ma Zhanshan before attacking Liaobei. Coincidentally, General Xue Xin's troops had misunderstandings with friendly forces and willingly became traitors, colluding with the Japanese army. On the evening of the 18th of this month, they launched a two-pronged attack on the righteous army from Zhangwu, Tieling, and Changtu. There were more than 200 Japanese and puppet troops attacking Jia Bingyi's troops in Kangping from Zhangwu. More than 300 Japanese and puppet troops attacked the positions of Jia and Gao's troops in Faku from Tieling. More than 100 Japanese troops attacked Jia's positions in Tongjiangkou and Jinjiatun from Changtu. The Japanese army also had more than ten airplanes assisting in the battle. The two sides fought fiercely. More than 30 Japanese troops and more than 40 puppet troops were killed. The number of wounded is countless. The righteous army led by Jia and Gao suffered more than 50 casualties. Liu Minglun, the commander of the Sixth Route Army of Gao Wenbin's troops, was injured in the hand. Chuan Youshan, the commander of the Fifth Regiment of Jia Bingyi's troops, was killed in action. Battalion commanders Cheng Haishan and Zhao Xisheng were also killed in action. Both sides suffered heavy losses. Because the righteous army lacked ammunition, they abandoned the Kangping County seat on the 24th. Jia and Gao are now actively reorganizing their troops and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Wang Fengge's Troops Still Defend Their Original Positions</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a person from Tonghua, after the Southern Route of the Liaodong Self-Defense Army withdrew from Tonghua, Huanren, and other places, the Northern Route of Wang Fengge's troops still defended their original positions. Last month, they also recaptured Dongfeng County. They are now planning a counterattack and setting a deadline to restore the original defense of the Southern Route. After the Japanese army occupied Tonghua, they transferred more than 1,000 troops from Korea to be stationed in Tonghua, Huanren, Ji'an, and other counties to assist in the defense. Wang's troops have increased to 80,000 to 90,000 people. At the beginning of the month, they sent Xu Xianting, Dai Yunfeng, and others to lead troops westward and occupy Chaoyangzhen and Shahekou. The Shenhai Road has not yet been fully opened. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>No Fighting in the Suburbs of Yixian County</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to transportation circles, there is currently no fighting in the suburbs of Yixian County. Tieling is still in the hands of the enemy. The righteous army led by Deng Tiemei fought fiercely with the enemy for a whole day in the Duomen area south of Fengcheng a few days ago. The enemy was defeated and abandoned a lot of military supplies. The Japanese side has been promoting that the enemy has occupied Kangping County, but the rumor that Gao Wenbin of the righteous army has been captured is not true. (Special Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>After the ceremony, Song Ziwen delivered a speech, first expressing his welcome and saying that the area most severely affected by last year's flood was the Yangtze River basin. Today's ceremony is held on a ship anchored in the Yangtze River, which is a very appropriate and memorable location. He then described the tragic situation of the flood in August last year and the establishment of the Relief Association to handle emergency relief, work relief, agricultural relief, and embankment repair. Finally, he described the embankment repair, saying that the work relief was divided into 18 districts, each district into 10 sections, reaching more than one million people. At the peak of work, it even reached more than 1.4 million people per day. According to the latest statistics, the rebuilt embankment reached 7,400 kilometers, nearly 15,000 Chinese miles long, most of which were newly built. The earthwork reached 115 million cubic meters, and the number of engineering personnel reached 4,620. The scale of the project is not difficult to imagine. The project cost as much as 70 million yuan. However, the scope of this embankment project is so wide that if the work cannot be completed in time, the summer rains will arrive in an instant, and there may be a risk of disaster again. Therefore, the entire project must keep pace with the times, and fortunately, it has been completed within the scheduled time, thanks to the efforts of the staff. Otherwise, this year's abundant harvest and low grain prices would not have been easily seen. After Song finished his speech, Xi Dejiong, the director of the Work Relief Office, reported on the work relief process, hoping that the survey team would provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Central Representative Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Next, Dai Chuanxian delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Government, saying that last year's disaster was extremely severe, and fortunately, various charitable organizations at home and abroad made every effort to help, which led to today's achievements. He hoped that the survey team would achieve satisfactory results on this trip and hoped that they would use their charitable hearts to make long-term and practical plans for the hard-working disaster victims, so that the disaster victims could have a peaceful way out.</p>
<h3>Guests' Speeches</h3>
<p>Next, the guests delivered speeches. ㈠ Bai Shuren, the representative of the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association, praised the greatness of the project. ㈡ Lin Kanghou said that last year's flood was like an illness, and now that the embankment project has been completed, it is like recovery. He hoped that friendly countries would continue to help the newly recovered patient, and hoped that the government would pay attention to it at ordinary times, and not seek medical treatment only when the disease is urgent. ㈢ Huang Renzhi said that the completion of this embankment project should not only thank the help of Chinese and foreign people, but also thank the 1.4 million workers who built the embankment, and hoped to pay attention to three points: First, we should study the methods of maintaining the embankment project. Second, the flood control methods, whether new or old, must be effective. Third, we should use scientific methods to implement charitable ideas.</p>
<h3>Jiangxin Wheel Sails Upstream</h3>
<p>The ceremony ended at 4:00 pm. After refreshments on the Jiangxin Wheel, Song and his wife, as well as various dignitaries and guests, disembarked one after another. At 7:00 pm, the ship sailed upstream. In addition to Chen Zhanen, the representative of the Ministry of Interior, and Cao Minjun, the counselor of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, Chu Minyi also traveled west on the same ship.

<h3>Japanese in Eastern Provinces Focus on Propaganda Policies</h3>
<p>Opium and Morphine Implemented as Public Monopoly</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese have installed broadcasting radios in various streets of Shenyang city, harshly criticizing China's poor political situation and spreading rumors to confuse the public. They have compiled ballads about the policies of the puppet state and sent female ballad singers to perform in major ports. The Japanese are changing their oppressive policies towards the people of Northeast China to a disguised appeasement policy in order to numb the people's minds. Opium is prevalent in the Northeast, and narcotics such as opium and morphine are all implemented as a public monopoly. In Kaiyuan County alone, there are no fewer than forty or fifty morphine and opium foreign firms, all opened by the Japanese, using narcotics to eliminate our race. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

Commanded by General Li Haiqing. Well-informed sources here now believe that only a change of attitude by General Su Bingwen can salvage this campaign, but Su has refused to negotiate with the Japanese and is determined to stand firm. It is heard that there are currently two empty trains, with the dining car equipment completely removed, heading west, presumably for use by the Red Cross for first aid. Colonel Komatsu, the Japanese officer who failed to negotiate with General Su Bingwen, telegraphed from Mazhafskaya in Russia, saying that 56 Japanese women and children will travel from Hailar to Manzhouli within days and then return to Japan via Mazhafskaya.

He has ordered all units to continue their efforts. (28th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Policy of Delay is Again Mysterious</h3>
<p>(1) Japan's Implicit Arguments to the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Council meeting of the League of Nations, after the back-and-forth debate between the representatives of China and Japan, has already been repeatedly commented on by this newspaper. The result of a week of fierce battles in the Council was that it was only submitted to the General Assembly of the League of Nations for resolution. However, at the beginning of the meeting, we did not dare to expect a concrete result. Moreover, the Japanese warlords, acting willfully, have been engaged in a military adventure policy every day for the past fifteen months. However, constrained by domestic conditions, they cannot help but be outwardly strong but inwardly weak. Not only are they more concerned.</p>
<p>On the day the Council of the League of Nations opened, the remarks made by Foreign Minister Uchida Kosai can give a glimpse into the general policy of the entire policy.</p>
<p>"...The Japanese Imperial Government's recognition of Manchukuo is not intended to violate the spirit of current international treaties. And it is confident that this kind of behavior is the only solution to the situation. In short, the state of anarchy in China is the cause of the dispute. All actions taken by Japan in the Manchurian Incident are based on international justice. And the independent existence of Manchukuo is an undeniable reality. If this truth can be understood, then discovering a solution should not be too difficult. I also deeply hope that it has the possibility (of solving)." This has already expressed the outline of the Japanese government's opinion on the Northeast issue. Moreover, Uchida is actually a spokesman for the military. As for the political aspects, whether it is the Seiyukai or the Minseito, under the banner of cooperative unity in the cabinet, no disagreements have been seen, nor dared to be any disagreements. After all, how can the military's "tiger whiskers" be easily trifled with. The opinion expressed by the Seiyukai is that "the League of Nations, which is recognized by the nations, should seek a solution based on the facts of Manchuria..." The opinion of the Minseito, on the other hand, reiterates that "the September 18th Incident was Japan's act of self-defense. The Investigative Team believes that the establishment of 'Manchukuo' was organized by Japanese and a few Manchurians. The majority of Manchurians are actually in opposition. The recognition of the Lytton [Commission] and others is especially wrong..." Other opinions expressed by various factions such as the National Alliance and the House of Peers, although worded differently, have the same intention. They are even exactly the same, as if they came from a single model. At least, under the command of the military, they make consistent words and actions.</p>
<p>At the same time, they shouted to their own people, "Have the greatest determination. Even if the League of Nations has fifty-six votes against Japan's one vote, we will not be afraid." And they do not hesitate to use "withdrawal from the League of Nations" as a threat. So, will Japan actually withdraw from the League of Nations? We have already discussed it in detail again and again. The possibility of it becoming a reality is very slim. (2) What are Japan's Dissenting Views?</p>
<p>If we examine closely all of Japan's actions in the Northeast in recent months, as well as the policies it has used diplomatically, we can know this. Among them, Japan's fraternization with the Soviet Union is the most important consideration. Matsuoka Yosuke's trip to Geneva also went via Moscow, lingering for as long as a week. He even participated in the November Revolution commemoration to show his goodwill to the Soviet Union. He tried hard to seek their understanding of the "non-aggression treaty." Although he may not be able to obtain the Siberian forest development rights, oil purchasing privileges, and fishing patents immediately, he really wants to take over the Chinese Eastern Railway. Therefore, Matsuoka's [trip] to the Soviet Union [was focused on] this matter. At the same time, he wanted to use the Soviet Union's important position in the Pacific and Europe. Not only could it contain the United States, but it could also threaten Britain and France, and use this to obtain the actual benefits of oil and fishing. However, the Soviet Union used its wait-and-see attitude. Matsuoka, being shrewd and capable, was like being lost in a fog. His back-and-forth responses did not seem to have any significant results. Diplomatic secrets may not be known at this moment, but Japan's frantic actions have long been seen in its empty boasting and continuous advocacy of "withdrawal from the League of Nations theory."</p>
<p>Japan's true attitude is not clearly expressed by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the military, nor is it convenient to express bluntly, in order to expose its shortcomings. Hanzawa Goshiro strongly urged the League of Nations to maintain a wait-and-see attitude and wait for Japan to reorganize "Manchuria" (suppress the people of the Northeast). Major newspapers such as Asahi and Mainichi also held the same view, advocating preventing and advising the League of Nations not to make a decision on the Northeast issue immediately. By delaying with a wait-and-see policy, a conversion strategy can definitely be sought in the near future.</p>
<p>(3) The Inevitable Trend of the Policy of Delay</p>
<p>Since the Japanese warlords have invaded the Northeast with military force and obscured the world with diplomacy, why do they still need to delay? This is because Japan is no longer the Japan of its youth during the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Its internal contradictions are increasingly expanding. For example, the establishment of next year's wartime budget and the issuance of over 890 million public bonds are also included in the budget, which is an unprecedentedly strange phenomenon. Therefore, the rift between the Seiyukai and the Minseito in the so-called cooperative unity cabinet is deepening. The general public in Japan is deeply dissatisfied with this political situation. In Saito's weakness and Takahashi's incompetence (after being frightened by the military, he immediately invested 9,500 yen (Japanese currency) to buy over the military and consolidate his power), the internal crisis is already evident. In the diplomatic field, they firmly hope that the new US president can reverse Hoover's policies, so that Japan can calmly make arrangements. However, if we look at the traditional diplomatic policy of the United States, how can it be fundamentally changed due to a change of presidents? Then Japan's difficulties still exist.</p>
<p>Volunteer armies in the Northeast rise up everywhere, fighting for cities and seizing land, and cutting off railways happens every day. They now have 100,000 elite soldiers, but they cannot fully maintain the security of the area along the railway. Even the safety of the army cannot be guaranteed. Recently, there has been a move to increase troops in Manchuria by two divisions. In this way, not only can they not quell the righteous armies in the Northeast, but they will only increase expenses. With internal unrest and many external troubles, they can only advocate delay, waiting for a new conversion in the international political situation, waiting for the exhaustion of the volunteer armies, and then they can let go to reap their benefits.</p>
<p>Our people, in this situation, should devote all their vitality, be strong and unyielding, and engage in a longer-term and more durable struggle against the Japanese warlords, in order to win the final victory.</p>

<p>Su Bingwen Telegraphed, Requesting Prompt Relief</p>
<p>"The Weather is Getting Colder Every Day, the War Situation is Urgent</p>
<p>Supplies and Ammunition Urgently Need Replenishment"</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain gentleman in Beiping from the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang People's Support Association received a telegram from Commander Su Bingwen in Hailar, stating: "Your eleven telegrams have been received. I feel unworthy of your high expectations. I cherish my country and dare to love my humble self. However, the vast wilderness of Manchuria and Hailar makes for heavy military expenses. To cure sores is to cut flesh, and it is difficult to satisfy hunger and cold. Far from being able to assist, I have only become a drop in the ocean. I trust that you will understand my difficult situation. I am grateful for your concern and respectfully present the true situation, including a detailed list of the uses of donations, and request instructions from the people of the country to demonstrate great faith. Since the uprising, your association and Mr. Chu Huiseng have successively remitted 20,000 yuan. Various circles here and the workers of the East Railway have donated a total of 19,492.94 yuan as of today. The 1,000 yuan that a certain newspaper telegraphed to donate has not yet arrived. All of the above funds have been used by this headquarters to comfort the wounded and dead, purchase supplies, replenish clothing, and reward the soldiers at the front. The funds have been exhausted. Now the weather is getting colder every day and the war situation is urgent. The brave soldiers who sleep in the snow and swallow ice, sacrificing themselves to save the country, have not received their salaries for three months. Even with the desire to die for their country, it is difficult to endure hunger and cold. Supplies, equipment, and ammunition urgently need replenishment. Looking ahead, my heart aches. The two gentlemen are enthusiastic about saving the country and lead the support efforts. I beg you to understand this difficult situation and quickly raise relief funds, so that the work of saving the country will not be abandoned halfway. Then we can reclaim our homeland and forever pay our respects. After subsequent donations are received, I will telegraphically report the uses to be made and publicize them. I hope to show faith to China and foreign countries and jointly abandon righteousness. Tearfully, I have stated my case, and I am at your command. Su Bingwen bows respectfully."

<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Announces</p>
<h3>The Truth of the Fushun Massacre</h3>
<p>Reported on the Central Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>Warning the Japanese to Abide by Humanitarianism</p>
<p>Must Strictly Prohibit Indiscriminate Killing of the Innocent, Women, and Children</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Reuter's report on the case of the Japanese army's abuse and killing of our Chinese people in Fushun is a major matter. The Japanese government ordered Murakami, the consul-general stationed in Nanjing, to inquire about the source of the news from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and request evidence for the case. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has provided evidence and responded, and at 6:30 PM on the 28th, it reported the circumstances of the Fushun massacre in Japanese on the Central Broadcasting Station. It pointed out that on September 16th, the Japanese army, believing that over 3,000 residents of the three towns near Fushun were in contact with the volunteer army, which concerned the safety of the Japanese army, used the excuse of investigating the truth to gather over 3,000 villagers in a certain place. They were immediately surrounded by machine guns. At the command, the machine guns fired in unison, and over a thousand innocent people, old and young, women and children, were killed under the inhuman command of the Japanese warlords. Among those who were gathered, only 113 people were fortunate enough to escape. The Japanese army's cruelty has been documented step by step. The Japanese people were warned not to allow the warlords to indiscriminately kill our country's good people and cause eternal hatred between the Chinese and Japanese people. This case is now a humanitarian issue for all of humanity and will surely lead to major diplomatic negotiations. (28th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Military Vehicle on the Puppet Fengshan Railway</p>

<h3>Liang Brigade Transferred to Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Depart from Wenzhou on the 30th</p>
<p>Liu Zhennian Expresses His Intention to Resign from Military Service</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The 6,000-plus men of the 2nd Brigade of the 20th Division, commanded by Liang Lizhu, arrived in Wenzhou on five ships. They all disembarked on the night of the 27th and were stationed in the ancestral halls of Yongjia County and the houses prepared by the county government. The relationship between the army and the people is harmonious, and the supplies are sufficient for five days. The brigade has now been ordered to depart from Lishui on the 30th and advance towards northern Fujian. Chief of Staff Han Dong took the night train to Shanghai on the 28th to transfer to Wenzhou by ship to discuss the Lu incident. Our division is unwilling to participate in internal strife and has made concessions step by step. There are rumors about the discipline of the army, and it is hoped that various organizations will go to Wenzhou to observe on the ground. It is not difficult to distinguish between truth and falsehood. Currently, one part is stationed on the border of southern Zhejiang, adhering to the orders of the central government and absolutely obeying the command and transfer of the Chairman of Zhejiang Province and cooperating effectively with the provincial government. If the bandit forces slightly subside, we will assist in completing the local roads in Wenzhou to strengthen coastal defense. However, our division has just arrived in the southern land, and there are inevitably obstacles due to customs and language. It is hoped that all circles will provide guidance.

He stated that he was very pleased to meet with colleagues from both railways upon his arrival in Hankou. He also mentioned that the railways had been severely affected by the continuous domestic wars in recent years. Currently, efforts were being made to reorganize the existing lines and expand new lines. However, due to the uncleared principal and interest on old debts, new debts could not be undertaken, hindering railway development. He emphasized that the railways must establish their own creditworthiness. He hoped everyone would work hard together to promote construction.

<h3>Central Party Headquarters Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Ye Chucang Reports on Advancing Party Work</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters held the 54th Memorial Week for the late Premier on the 28th at 9 a.m. Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Wang Qi, Li Ciwen, Ding Chaowu, Hong Ludong, Yang Jie, Zhu Jiahua, Chu Minyi, Chen Guofu, Zhang Daofan, and over 600 staff members attended. After Chairman Ye Chucang led the attendees in performing the rituals, he reported on "Relieving the Party's Economic Difficulties and Advancing Its Work." He stated that the Central Party Headquarters and party branches at the provincial, county, and municipal levels all felt economic hardship, but there was also waste. Taking the provinces as an example, each province had a newspaper and news agency run by the provincial party headquarters. If party members could participate in local newspapers and news agencies, making them the party's newspapers and news agencies, it could resolve part of the economic difficulties. The lower-level work of the party was hollow, and the grassroots strength among the people was not as strong as that of local bullies and evil gentry. The party must live in society and be used and supported by society in order to have an impact on society. Rural areas and district branches must cooperate closely, and district branches should make every effort in economic and educational construction for agriculture and industry. Even though the party headquarters may not be visible, the true strength of the party could be established from this. It could be said that the power of the party is visible when the party headquarters and party members are not visible. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beginning January 1 Next Year</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia's Second Five-Year Plan</h3>
<p>Develop Eastern and Western Siberia and Build Vladivostok</p>
<p>Railways and All Construction Thoroughly Electrified</p>
<p>▲TASS News Agency Berri Dispatch on the 21st: The Soviet Union's second five-year plan, beginning January 1 next year, will focus on the development of Eastern and Western Siberia. This region is larger in area than Germany, France, Italy, and Poland combined, with enormous hydropower and abundant mineral resources, and is extremely important to the Soviet Union's national economy. In the first five-year plan, two coal mines and miner's unions were established in the area. In the next plan, the number will be increased, so that the hydropower of this area can make any industry surpass others. In the future, railways will run through this area for tens of thousands of miles, and all will be powered by electricity. All other construction will be thoroughly</p>
<p>Electrified as the basis. The power plant is named Angarastrai, and its scale is larger than Neprostrai. It consists of many hydroelectric plants scattered over a large area. The Nipo plant generates 20,000,000,000 kilowatt-hours per year. In the second five-year plan, the Angara plant will generate 20,000,000,000 kilowatt-hours, accounting for one-fifth of the total power generation in the Soviet Union. The construction of this project will begin in 1933 and will not be completed until 1942 in the third five-year plan. In addition, there are smaller power plants, such as the Bajato Tian Factory near the Kiriza Fubo Coalfield, with an annual power generation of 5,500,000,000 kilowatt-hours, the Bajarkayee Factory near Irkutsk with the same power generation, the Paidenskoiy Factory, and the Krasnoyarsk Factory on the Yenisei River, all of which are in the Siberian development plan.</p>
<p>The construction of the port of Vladivostok is particularly important. The number of commercial ships entering and leaving the port has greatly increased in recent years. In 1930, there were only 1,025 ships, and in 1931, the number increased to 2,233. This year, due to other factors, the result will be a tour of the port, but because of the increase in wood transport, traffic to Sakhalin and Kamchatka has also increased. It is expected that it will not be below the record of 1927-29. The port of Vladivostok is now developing rapidly and becoming an independent port. In the past, Siberia was undeveloped, and the port relied entirely on the Chinese Eastern Railway for sustenance. However, the current situation has changed, and the port can now break away from the Chinese Eastern Railway and become independent. The port of Vladivostok was established in 1860, but it did not develop until the construction of the Siberian Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway in the 19th century. Its special value is that it does not freeze for three months each year. Ten years ago, the Japanese army and the White Russians occupied the area. After they withdrew, construction gradually flourished. This year, there are many factories and schools, making it the industrial and cultural center of Eastern and Western Siberia. The Soviet Union's Pacific merchant fleet is based in Vladivostok. The fleet has 37 ships with a tonnage of approximately 85,000, but this amount is not enough to meet the needs of the port's commerce, so foreign ships are also allowed to enter and leave, most of which are Japanese ships, as well as Chinese and Norwegian ships. The sailors are mostly Chinese. Since the establishment of direct air links between Vladivostok and Moscow, the port has become more important. From Berri to the port, the</p>
<p>The Ussuri Railway will be built with double tracks and will be connected to the railroads to Ugornaya, Gangus, Suchin, Nagoda, Transbaikalia, and Heihe. Many Chinese workers in Vladivostok are doing their best for socialist construction. Most of them are no longer illiterate.</p>

<p>Britain and France Decide to Again Request the United States to Suspend War Debt Payments</p>
<p>MacDonald and Herriot Convene Cabinet Meetings</p>
<p>To Study the Nature of the Reply to the US Government</p>
<h3>The Impact of War Debts on the World Economy</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 27th: British Prime Minister MacDonald and Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain rushed back to London today to attend cabinet discussions on how to respond to the United States regarding the war debt issue. The British government acknowledges that what is urgently needed is to quickly end the current uncertain state of affairs and immediately submit a well-reasoned application to the United States, in order to persuade the United States to agree to suspend the war debt payment due on December 15. MacDonald and others will meet at Downing Street tonight to study the nature of the reply, in order to submit it to the full cabinet meeting on Sunday. The new British reply will be issued quickly. Whether Britain can pay will depend on the US reply. The British government now believes that the United States has not finally rejected Britain's request for a delay in payment.</p>
<h3>Reply May Be Sent Today</h3>
<p>▲National Press, London, 27th: Britain's reply to the United States after the United States refused to suspend the war debt payment due in December can be drafted no later than Tuesday. It is reported that the reply will detail the circumstances under which payment is not appropriate under the current world economic conditions. However, whether Britain will pay is still undecided at this time. The British government is currently studying the impact of this payment or suspension on the world financial market. Prime Minister MacDonald, Lord President of the Council Baldwin, and ministers from relevant departments have sacrificed their regular holiday on Sunday and are still meeting with experts at Downing Street for several hours to discuss the content of the reply. In addition, they are also preparing various statistics to show the impact on the economy after the payment on November 15, in order to summarize and inform the United States. This is because the US response stated that the original British letter did not detail the supporting evidence for having to suspend the payment, and the United States was not in a position to agree to the suspension. It is reported that this reply will be discussed with opposition leaders such as Samuel of the Liberal Party and Lansbury of the Labour Party before it is sent to the United States.</p>
<p>▲National Press, Paris, 27th: It is now believed that France's reply to the United States' refusal to suspend war debt payments will be drafted before Prime Minister Herriot goes to Geneva. Its content is said to be similar to the British reply. Herriot met with Army Chief Pengu and Finance Minister Martin today to discuss war debts and disarmament issues, believing that the government's position on these two issues should be decided before he goes to Geneva.</p>
<p>▲National Press, Brussels, 28th: The Belgian newspaper reported that the government will decide not to pay the US war debt due on December 15, regardless of the outcome of the British, French, and other major countries' negotiations with the United States.</p>
<p>▲National Press, Athens, 28th: The Greek government has formally notified the United States that it is unable to pay the next installment of debt, 440,000 gold dollars.</p>
<h3>Washington Leaders Express</h3>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, 27th: The New York Times quoted Washington leaders as saying that in order to change the current unfriendly attitude of the US Congress, Britain's new reply on the war debt issue must present convincing reasons. The New York Tribune reported that there is an optimistic expectation in London that the payment in December can be overcome by the establishment of new methods. What is the reason? Washington officials have not been able to understand this, but there is now the possibility of seeking a solution on a broad front, even eliminating the US policy of handling each debtor country separately, rather than with</p>
<h3>German Engineer Studies Rockets</h3>
<p>Using Alcohol and Oxygen as Power</p>
<p>Can Carry One Person to Try Ascending the Sky</p>
<p>▲National Press, Magdeburg, 27th: German engineer Nibel has been studying rockets for many years. He announced today that he will build a rocket that can carry a person to try ascending the sky next spring. If it is successful at that time, it will create a new record in the history of rockets and open a new record in the flying world. Nibel hopes that the rocket will rise to a height of 3,000 feet, and then the passenger will jump off with a parachute. If the experiment is successful, a larger rocket will be made, which is expected to reach a height of 13 miles. No gunpowder is used in the rocket. It uses an explosive liquid made of alcohol and oxygen as power. Half of the cost of manufacturing and research over the years is borne by local authorities, and half is donated by friends. The people and authorities here are also paying close attention to the progress of Nibel's work. In recent Sundays, countless enthusiastic people have often gone to Nibel's residence in the suburbs to visit or listen to Nibel's explanations.</p>
<p>Each debtor country is jointly solving the problem. Washington people predict that Britain will ask the United States to cancel the method of requesting a 29-day notice for deferred debt payments and ask the United States to agree to defer the principal of the debt, which is now 30 million US dollars. According to the New York Observer, France's decision will almost certainly shift with Britain. The difficulties France faces are not like Britain's difficulties in exchange rates, but in finding funds is not easy because the French budget is already severely short. France will probably reply to the United States this week. France will state that if the payment is made, it will not be regarded as a precedent. France's payment this time is only to resolve the security of the war debt issue.</p>
<h3>Russo-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty Ratified</h3>
<p>▲Havas, Warsaw, 27th: The non-aggression treaty and reconciliation agreement between Poland and Soviet Russia have been ratified by order of the Polish President. The constitution does not explicitly stipulate the presidential ratification of treaties. The various treaties listed in the constitution that must be ratified by parliament do not explicitly include non-aggression treaties. Polish jurists believe that only treaties that involve national finances and compel the country to take certain actions must be submitted to parliament for review. Non-aggression treaties are purely negative promises and are therefore not included in the above-mentioned treaties. According to the Polish government, the non-aggression treaty may not be submitted to parliament, and most members were originally prepared to pass this treaty. However, after the negotiations between Romania and Soviet Russia broke down, Polish officials wanted to settle the matter as soon as possible, so they adopted the procedure of presidential ratification.</p>
<p>▲National Press, Warsaw, 28th: Newspapers related to the government today issued special editions welcoming the final ratification of the Russo-Polish non-aggression treaty, saying that Poland's international position can be further consolidated as a result. Several newspapers deeply regretted that Romania had not concluded a similar treaty with Soviet Russia, saying that this move could make peace in Eastern Europe more stable.</p>
<h3>German Political System</h3>
<p>Schleicher Forms Cabinet in Negotiations</p>
<p>The Greatest Mission of the Federal President</p>
<p>Hitler's Influence Gradually Declines</p>
<p>▲National Press, Berlin, 28th: The call for a successor to the German Chancellor is still concentrated on General Schleicher. It is generally expected that, as with the current truce negotiations between the new cabinet and the parliament, if it can succeed, Schleicher's premiership can be practically determined on Monday or Tuesday. At present, the negotiations are being carried out under high pressure, with the intention of adjourning the parliament until December next year. Schleicher will also talk with the Catholic and Socialist trade unions, because if Schleicher forms a cabinet, he will concentrate his efforts on the unemployment problem, so in order to seek the stability of the government, he must have the support of these two trade union factions. If Schleicher's move is unsuccessful, the final way out of the political situation, it is expected that the president will re-appoint Papen to form a cabinet and dissolve the new parliament.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Berlin, 27th: We have gained a great benefit from the political situation in Germany in recent days, that is, the greatest mission of the Federal President in German politics is clear from this line of action. In the midst of internal chaos in Germany, the Federal President is the only pillar in the stream. Germany, a large country with a population of 60 million, is destined by the head of state's final word. The whole country is in awe and looks to Hindenburg's lead, which is also very different. The remarks of German reporter Hans Zehrer have always been regarded as representing the views of Defense Minister Schleicher. In view of Hindenburg's high age of 80, he is very worried about this phenomenon. Hindenburg has reached the age of decline. If he suddenly falls ill, the authority of the country may go with it. If Hitler is elected as the Federal President in the future, he should not be allowed to have the same power as Hindenburg. After the establishment of the new authoritarian cabinet, its main task is this point. At present, it is naturally impossible to talk about amending the constitution, because if you want to amend the constitution, you must implement a "coup", and Hindenburg is unwilling to use this method. However, since the presidential election law is not stipulated in the constitution, it can be amended by order of the law. In this regard, or a new law can be stipulated, the Federal President may designate a candidate for the successor President before the end of his term or in his will, and the House of Representatives may also elect another person as the second candidate by an absolute majority, and when the people vote to elect a new president, they will choose between these two. If the presidential election law is amended in this way, the immediate effect that can occur is roughly as follows: except that the Hitler Party has an absolute majority of seats in the House of Representatives, Hitler has no possibility of being elected as a presidential candidate by the House. However, if the Xi Party occupies an absolute majority in the House, there is no other way to prevent Hitler from taking power except by force. The struggle in German politics is unclear at present, but its relationship is very important. You can imagine the intentions of all parties on amending the presidential election law.</p>
<p>▲National Press, Berlin, 28th: Yesterday, city elections were held in the cities and towns of Bremen and other cities. The voters of the middle class parties increased by 10% compared with the recent general elections, the National Socialist Party decreased by 22%, and the Social Democratic Party decreased by 8%. Although this matter is not very relevant, it is also very noteworthy.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Copenhagen, 28th - In his speech here, Trotsky did not attack the Moscow authorities. He only praised the communist system and its industrial progress, contrasting it with the current state of capitalist countries, leaving the judgment of superiority or inferiority to the audience. Finally, he indirectly proposed peace overtures to Stalin, declaring that he was ready to return to the country at any time, as he always wanted to be a radical. There were no disturbances in the hall during the speech, but there was not much applause.</p>

Trotsky is currently in Denmark and plans to visit Lund University in December. Trotsky's brand of communism differs from that of the Russian authorities, which led to his exile in 1928. However, his influence is still feared by the opposition.</p>
<h3>World Cotton Harvest</h3>
<p>This Year is the Lowest in Nine Years</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 27th - The US Department of Agriculture announced today that this year's world cotton harvest will be the lowest in nearly nine years. This is because the acreage planted with cotton in the United States has been sharply reduced, and the cessation of cotton cultivation in Egypt is even more significant. It has been predicted that cotton production will decrease by 33%. Therefore, even though the cotton harvest in Brazil, Mexico, and Lower India is estimated to reach 4.2 million bales, an increase of 800,000 bales compared to the previous year, and there has also been an increase in cotton production in China and Persia, the estimated global production is only 23.4 million bales. Among them, the US harvest will be between 11 million and 12 million bales. In 1923, the world cotton harvest was 19.125 million bales. The following year, it suddenly increased to 23.825 million bales. Since then, the surplus has accumulated daily, and cotton prices have plummeted. This is the first sharp reduction in nearly nine years.</p>

<h3>Japanese Militarists Again Attempt to Invade Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>▲ Using the Su Bingwen Incident as a Pretext</p>
<p>▲ Claiming It Is Related to Zhang Xueliang</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Vigorously Promote Disturbances in North China</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, "Our side (the Japanese side) has repeatedly contacted Su Bingwen, but Su Bingwen has refused to meet. Our military believes that the anti-Japanese forces in the Xing'an Mountains will put up a stubborn resistance, and will take resolute measures against the Soviet army. The military is currently studying concrete plans. One aspect is the issue of the residents of Manchuria who are prohibited from residing in the area. When Koiso, the chief of staff of the Kwantung Army, returned to Beijing a few days ago, he discussed the matter carefully with the military authorities. The military authorities are willing to sacrifice the banned residents, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is extremely reluctant and still asks the military to discuss a comprehensive plan. However, a new problem has now arisen, namely, evidence of a connection between Su Bingwen's troops and Zhang Xueliang. Therefore, in order to eradicate all anti-Japanese volunteer armies resisting in Manchuria, Zhang Xueliang, who is entrenched in Beiping, is considered harmful to the security of Manchuria. In addition to issuing a major warning in advance, there will be a direct attack on North China."</p>
<p>The Nagoya Shimbun published an editorial on the 22nd, stating that according to Koiso, the chief of staff of the Kwantung Army, who returned to Changchun from Tokyo, during his transit through Seoul, Korea, he told a newspaper reporter, "Su Bingwen does not seem to have any intention of repenting, and a peaceful solution is almost impossible." However, the major problem facing our army is that we do not want to sacrifice the lives of our citizens, but it is quite difficult to rescue them. Su Bingwen's guilt lies in the fact that he disregarded our repeated advice and did not respond to our army's demands. How is Zhang Xueliang to blame? Zhang Xueliang in Beiping and Su Bingwen in northern Manchuria seem to be in contact. If Su Bingwen did not have Zhang Xueliang's support, he would certainly not dare to resist for a long time. Therefore, the Kwantung Army has no choice but to resolve the Zhang Xueliang issue. When the Lytton Investigation Team arrived in China, they actually received a secret report from Ma Zhanshan. This time, the League of Nations is discussing the Lytton Report, which was again obstructed by Su Bingwen. These two major planned actions are undoubtedly instigated by Zhang Xueliang. In order to maintain the security of Manchuria in the future, we must have a resolute determination. During the Manchurian Incident, the Jinzhou government was defeated by our army, and Zhang Xueliang's forces retreated to the west of Shanhaiguan. Now, in order to resolve the security of northern Manchuria, our army has no choice but to attack North China in the end. Otherwise, in the future, there will inevitably be a second and third Ma Zhanshan and a second and third Su Bingwen, and how can the security of Manchuria be completed?"</p>

<h3>Japanese Consul Yamazaki's Report on the Incident Diary (Continued)</h3>
<p>(October 3rd) At 10:00 AM, Deputy Zheng visited and reported on the situation of Uno and Kohara, and said that the headquarters intended to send the list of people sheltered in the Jiang Consulate and missing persons to the headquarters for reference. This official sent the above list and entrusted him to inquire about the protection and news of the residents in Hailar, Yilekede, and Duranor.</p>
<p>(October 4th) An anti-Japanese demonstration broke out, with 400 primary school students joining. Led by a music team, they went straight to the consulate and gave anti-Japanese speeches. The atmosphere was very high. A slogan of "Down with Japan" was posted on the consulate's gate. Shortly after, Lieutenant Colonel Liang handed over a receipt for 1,000 yuan received from Dayang by the Hailar dispatch officer. At this time, I learned that the Hailar residents and the two dispatch officers in the consulate, Yamakita and Torisu, were safe and sound. On the other hand, I negotiated with Lieutenant Colonel Yezhong to crack down on the Chinese people's demonstration. At 6:00 PM, Constable Yanzaki was escorted back to the consulate by the headquarters.</p>
<p>(October 5th) The food stored in the consulate is gradually running out, and white rice in the city has also been sold out. I reported to Deputy Peng to do his best and managed to get some adzuki beans and vegetables. At the same time, food and clothing were sent to the imprisoned police officers. Also, because the cash had run out, I borrowed money from the Russian consul for the second time. At 5:00 PM, resident Miyabe Kumahei came to the consulate and requested to negotiate with the headquarters as soon as possible for the detained Japanese.</p>
<p>(October 6th) At 10:30 AM, I received a call from the Russian consul, who had obtained permission from the Railway Protection Army Headquarters to send cash. I then bought some snacks and sent them to the police officers.</p>
<p>(October 7th) At noon, a plane of our army flew over the consulate to scout the situation. The evacuees were extremely happy. At 12:20 PM, Russian Consul Smirnov and Secretary Masgaryan visited, and the headquarters translated Russian.</p>
<p>(October 9th) In the morning, Major General Peng and others wore armbands with red and black colors, with the four characters "Iron-Blooded Save the Country" written on white cloth. On this day, I heard that some residents were sick due to incomplete accommodation in the evacuation area and the lack of sanitary materials, making treatment difficult. Fortunately, two of the police officers' wives were nurses and helped with the diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>(October 10th) It was the Double Tenth Festival in China. There was no special performance in the city, but the headquarters held a celebration meeting, which Major General Peng also attended. On this day, I urged the headquarters to allow residents to withdraw and asked the Russian consul for a third loan.</p>
<p>(October 11th) The headquarters ordered me to attend a meeting, but I declined due to illness. On the other hand, I entrusted Major General Peng to investigate whether there were any rice merchants in the city who could buy white rice, but it was difficult to start. I had no choice but to buy 20 bags of flour.</p>
<p>(October 12th) The horses in the consulate were all escaped by both Chinese and Russian people since the incident occurred, and the feed was sufficient. I entrusted Commander Ingerling to take care of them. Soon, I received a telegram from the Soviet consul, saying that there was a shortage of cash and only 400 yuan in taxes were sent. However, the weather was getting colder, and the detained residents and the women in the shelter were suffering from a lack of bedding. I bought 100 bundles of straw and 6 pieces of coarse cloth for temporary use.</p>
<p>(October 13th) In the afternoon, the installation of cold-proof equipment was completed.</p>
<p>(October 14th) On this day, 30 to 40 wounded and sick soldiers were sent from the Xing'an Mountains, and 284 soldiers were transported to Hailar. It was rumored that there was a conflict between Zhalantun and the Japanese army. At 2:00 PM, the Soviet consul called and said that he had telegraphed the Moscow government about the meeting on the 7th and informed Japanese Councilor Amakasu.</p>
<p>(October 15th) At 11:00 AM, Lieutenant Colonel Liang and Director Guo came to the consulate and entrusted me to expedite the purchase of white rice to relieve the residents.</p>
<p>(October 16th) It was rumored in the city that Japanese planes bombed Hailar on the morning of the 15th, injuring innocent people.</p>
<p>(October 18th) This is the order to prohibit the removal of food from Hailar. Also, from the mouths of the Russians who repaired the houses in the consulate, I learned that on the 15th, Hailar was attacked by Japanese military aircraft, and three bombs were dropped. Forty miles of the railway in the rear of Qiqihar have been damaged. On this day, the president of the local Chamber of Commerce and Shaojiang Zhao went to Hailar to discuss the expenses with Su Bingli. On the other hand, the Chinese Self-Defense Corps was organized in the city and trained at the White Russian Middle School. There were about 300 members.</p>
<p>(October 19th) The headquarters raised funds from the shops in the city, and the Russians spread rumors that the Japanese army would come.</p>
<p>(October 20th) I telegraphed the Japanese Embassy in Moscow through the Soviet consul, and begged Commander Ingerling to release the residents and provide food as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(October 22nd) Through negotiations with the Soviet consul, the withdrawal of unrelated residents has been agreed to, and a train is prepared to transport them.</p>
<p>(October 23rd) A general meeting of the evacuees was held to discuss relief measures. I am willing to go back to China with the consul to mediate relief.</p>
<p>(October 24th) At 10:30 AM, the Soviet consul notified by telephone that the first batch of residents to be evacuated would be women and children, and the second batch would be men, but Japanese who were able to fight and those who served in the "Manchukuo" organs would not be allowed to withdraw. Therefore, I quickly compiled a list of women and men's groups and provided them to the Soviet consul in order to obtain permission from the Railway Protection Army Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Bombings Occur in Tianjin for Days</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Bombings have occurred in Tianjin for the past two or three months. The inside story is mostly related to the sale of Japanese goods. North China has always been a major distribution center for Japanese goods. Merchants are profit-oriented, and the municipal government's relentless crackdown on anti-Japanese movements has emboldened them to place orders enthusiastically. Most of these goods are disguised with Western trademarks to deceive people. Patriotic youths are deeply resentful. On the night of the 14th of this month, after bombs exploded simultaneously at the Heji Bicycle Shop on Fourth Road in the French Concession and the Yuda Foreign Cloth Store behind the Yong'an Hotel in Henghe Lane, explosions occurred again on the previous two nights. It is estimated that at about 6:00 PM on the 24th, a young man suddenly placed a cloth-wrapped bomb in an old vacant room in the Lao Zhongji Hardware Store at the south entrance of Nanxie Street, at the intersection of the Chinese and Japanese concessions. The workers there suspected something was wrong and immediately informed the police, who went to the location of the package to investigate. Fortunately, it did not explode. At the same time, when the Guanchang Cloth Store on Beima Road was open for business, a young man suddenly came and threw a bomb in from the upper right. The store's employees quickly avoided it and were not injured. Similar incidents also occurred at the Zhengda Foreign Cloth Store across from the Wanshou Palace in the store and at a cotton yarn store in Xiaohongqiao. At about 8:00 PM, a cloth-wrapped bomb was suddenly found between the doors and windows of the Chengji Paper Store at No. 24 in the French Concession. Because a customer who was buying goods saw it first, it did not explode. At the same time, a young man also threw a bomb at the Yuanfaxiang Cloth Store next to the Datong Shop on Xima Road (placing it in a bucket in front of the store), destroying five pieces of glass. Last night (the 25th) at about 7:00 PM, a young man suddenly threw a bomb into the Changshengyu Paint Store on Beima Road in the Chinese Concession. There was a loud bang, which resounded throughout the city. The store's four glass doors facing the street and the glass door on the front wall, which was about ten feet away, were damaged, and two employees, Ma Dingsan and apprentice Si Rutan, were injured. They were immediately sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. It is said that their lives are not in danger. At that time, all the shops in the nearby Gu Yi Street and Needle Street closed their doors to avoid danger. Japanese goods stores were especially fearful. The police sub-station in charge temporarily announced martial law and checked pedestrians. More than an hour and a half later, a sub-grenade was suddenly thrown from the veranda on the fourth floor of the Hengyi Foreign Cloth Store in the Tianxiang Market in the French Concession. The store's manager, Yang Wenjin, and accountant, Jia Tongquan, were both injured in the head and sent to the Xikai French Hospital for treatment. The entire venue was in chaos, and the cries were very loud. The Municipal Public Security Bureau held an emergency meeting today to discuss prevention measures due to the discovery of explosives in the city, which is related to public safety. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Salvation Association of Merchants and Citizens are also scheduled to convene merchants dealing in Japanese goods to discuss thorough elimination measures. However, whether this can actually be achieved still depends on whether the merchants have a real awakening. (December 26th)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhennian's Troops are Stationed in Fujian</h3>
<p>▲ Chen Jiliang Inspected the Navy in Fujian for Days</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Regarding the transfer of Liu Zhennian's troops to Fujian and Zhejiang, the Provincial Government received a telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs a few days ago, stating that Shouning, Zhenghe, Songxi, and Pucheng, which border northern Fujian and eastern Zhejiang, have been designated as their defense area. In addition to the division commander sending personnel to negotiate, please order the governments of the respective counties to take care of Liu's division when they arrive. According to a certain senior military agency, Liu's entire division has more than 18,000 people. Approximately 12,000 people will enter Fujian, board ships in Yantai, and land in Wendeng. Then, they will take the route through Pingyang and Taishun counties to enter Shouning. However, the four counties of Shou, Zheng, Song, and Pu are narrow and the people are poor, so it may be difficult to accommodate this large army. In the future, Pingshan and Fu'an counties will also be assigned to their garrison. The Second Brigade of the Marine Corps, led by Lin Chengchou, is planned to be transferred to Fuding, Xiapu, and Ningde counties along the coast, to form a line with the First Brigade of the Marine Corps, led by Yang Tingying, which is currently stationed in Luoyuan, Lianjiang, and Changle counties. However, it has not yet been designated where the Fourth Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, led by Xu Yuguang, which is currently stationed in the three counties of Pu, Zheng, and Song, will be transferred. As for whether Liu's division will be under the control of the Pacification Office after entering Fujian, it is not yet known because no orders have been received from the Military Commission. Chen Jiliang, Deputy Minister of the Navy and Commander of the First Fleet, came to Fujian to inspect the fleet. On the 17th, he arrived in Fuzhou from Xiamen on the Haichou warship and anchored at Mawei. In recent days, he has inspected the various forts at the mouth of the Min River, Changmen, Jinpai, and Yutou Niuqiu, as well as the four warships stationed near Mawei, Datong, Ziqiang, Tongji, and Yongxu, as well as the Mawei Shipyard Naval Academy. He is now ordering the troops of the First Brigade of the Marine Corps, which is stationed in Fuzhou, to take turns to Mawei for inspection. He will take a ship to Sandu in the next few days and order the troops of the Second Brigade of the Marine Corps, which are stationed in Funing, to take turns to the area for inspection, and then return to Beijing. However, there have been rumors that Yang Shuzhuang and Chen Shaokuan jointly guarantee Chen Jiliang to succeed as the chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government. Yang Shuzhuang telegraphed Chen Peikun to Shanghai yesterday to discuss this matter, but Chen strongly denied it. (November 23rd)</p>

The night before, Zhou Hexin invited Wu Abao and Zhao Qiaosheng to Li's house and smothered him to death with a quilt. Fearing that they would be discovered, they waited until Li was dead before hanging the body on the beam to make it look like suicide, in an attempt to cover it up. The next morning, Sun pretended that her husband had committed suicide and cried bitterly. Neighbors went to watch. Li's uncle also got the news and rushed to the scene. Seeing the marks of a hemp rope on the deceased's neck, he knew that it was a murder.

More than ten days ago, a red pill addict, Yang A'gen (nicknamed White-Eyed A'gen), sneaked into the store to steal copper spoons, shovels, and other items. The store clerk discovered it and tied up Yang A'gen with a rope and beat him severely. Then, he sent him to the watchman and locked him with a large iron chain. However, Yang A'gen had long been skinny and weak from his addiction to red pills. After being beaten, his injuries were so severe that he was dying. Later, the store clerk and the watchman carried him to an empty boat that was being repaired on the shore nearby. However, A'gen died of his injuries in the early morning of the previous day. The boat owner found out and, fearing that he would be implicated, immediately carried the body to the ground. Later, Peng Xiwu, Director of the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge of the area, learned about it. Because the case involved human life, he sent the police to arrest the watchman and informed Wu Jiahe, the chief of the Fourth District of the area, to report to the County Court for an autopsy.</p>
<p>▲ Automobile Dispute Re-emerges, The decision of the Jiangyin County Party and government talk meeting to allow small cars to run eight trips a day and issue flags by the Jiangyin Construction and Public Security Bureaus seems to have come to an end. The representatives of the small car company, Shi Qinglin and others, took a small car to Jiangyin County a few days ago to get the flag. However, the representatives went to the bureau three times and failed to get the flag. The representatives believed that the flag could have been made in a moment, but the bureau director was deliberately delaying. Because it was getting late, they immediately returned to Wuxi in the original car. However, when they passed the Songqiao Bridge, they were suddenly stopped by the Public Security Bureau, who seized the general license plate. The representatives were indignant at their deliberate oppression and have now submitted a report to the Civil Construction Bureaus, requesting that the Director of the Construction Bureau, Yang Pinsun, and others be dismissed and severely punished, and ordered to handle the matter impartially. In addition, the Ministry of Railways has recently decided that the highway should be used to assist railway transportation. The Wuxi-Cheng Highway connects the Yangtze River to the north and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to the south. It is necessary to handle the joint transportation of the highway. Therefore, it has sent personnel to Cheng to investigate and negotiate everything with the long-distance bus company.</p>

<p>▲ Yong Tai Chang Copper and Tin Shop Ceases Business for Liquidation. Yong Tai Chang Copper and Tin Shop, located at the entrance of Wan Jia Alley, was established as a partnership by the Yang and Tong families. It had been operating successfully for several years, accumulating profits of over ten thousand in the past two years and gaining a strong reputation. Consequently, it attracted deposits totaling around twenty thousand yuan, mostly belonging to widows and orphans as their means of survival, or to elderly people for funeral expenses. The highest monthly interest rate was 1.2%, while the lowest was 0.6% or 0.7%. However, at the end of October, rumors of instability and planned liquidation spread. This caused a rush of withdrawals. A certain gentleman intervened, proposing a three-year moratorium on principal repayments, with only interest payments to be made to maintain operations and prevent losses for both parties. The majority of depositors agreed, and the business continued to operate. Unexpectedly, it suddenly announced its closure the other day, hiring a lawyer to handle the liquidation. It is estimated that the shortfall in deposits and outstanding accounts amounts to over twenty thousand yuan, while the inventory and assets are said to be worth only five thousand gold, and are already being liquidated.

<p>▲ Many Die After Eating Whale Meat. On the twenty-third, a huge whale, about thirty feet long and over ten feet in girth, was suddenly discovered on the sandbar of Donghai Beach in Juegang. It was about to die of dehydration. More than ten fishermen from Dongxia near the sandbar agreed to bring knives to cut up the meat for cooking. When the fishermen were butchering the whale, tears suddenly streamed from the whale's eyes. The fishermen did not care and cut off hundreds of pounds of fresh meat, which they cooked and ate with relish. Seventeen people ate the meat together. Unexpectedly, all seventeen of them soon began vomiting and diarrhea, resembling a plague. Despite medical treatment, they died one after another. At the same time, several people who had not eaten the meat also contracted the disease and died because they helped cut the meat. The incident caused a sensation far and wide and is considered miraculous.</p>

<p>The Northern Righteous Army Rescue Team telegraphed yesterday, stating: "To all public organizations and newspapers nationwide, Japan is relying on military force to wantonly destroy. The emotions of the Chinese people are rising, and they are resisting with fervor. The situation is deteriorating daily. Looking ahead, our hearts and lungs are breaking. The League of Nations has recently formally decided to transfer the matter to the Committee of Nineteen and convene a special meeting to discuss it. At this time, Representatives Yan, Gu, and Guo are working hard to negotiate at the national defense platform. Their task is extremely important. All our countrymen should enthusiastically support the words of the representatives of China with nationwide unity. The plan for the September 18th incident must be based on maintaining the integrity of China's territory and sovereignty and not violating international covenants. There must also be adequate preparation to serve as their backing. If the member states are powerless, our government and people should also do their best to store grain and collect funds, strengthen troops and prepare horses, and vow to deal with the violent enemy to achieve the goal of recovering land and sovereignty and human peace, so as to maintain the spirit and effectiveness of the covenant. We deeply love peace and insist on a righteous stand and cooperation with the international community. We sincerely do not want to advocate military force. It must be understood that power can never suppress justice. Therefore, no matter what, in this urgent national crisis, we must work together internally and externally. Diplomatic victory can be expected, and half of the mountains and rivers can be restored. This is fortunate for the Northeast and fortunate for the nation."</p>
<h3>National Joint Conference of National Salvation Groups Save Telegram</h3>
<p>The National Joint Conference of National Salvation Groups sent a telegram to Geneva, saying: "To Representatives Yan, Gu, and Guo in Geneva, Japan has forcibly occupied our three northeastern provinces and single-handedly created a puppet regime. Now, attending the League of Nations Administrative Council, they are at a loss for words and arguments. At first, they strongly opposed Lytton's attendance and spread rumors of withdrawing from the League of Nations as a threat. Then, realizing that their scheme would not work, they pretended to telegraph back home for instructions. Finally, they expressed concessions in the hope of currying favor with various countries, voluntarily abandoning their opposition to Lytton's attendance. This kind of feint is the same as the Shanghai January 28th Incident, shifting the target of the September 18th Incident in the East. Examining the contents of the League of Nations report, it lacks fair arguments and is even worse than Chapter 10, which is like a proposal to divide our country. Now Japan has expressed that they are willing to open the doors of the Eastern Provinces and give all countries equal opportunities, using the generosity of others to gain the sympathy of various countries. This association sees through their tricks and represents the national will. We specifically telegraph to the representatives, asking you to firmly refute the report at the meeting, request the implementation of Article 16 of the Covenant, and protect the rights that member states should enjoy. Otherwise, we will not hesitate to withdraw from the alliance. Our people across the country pledge to be your backing. Representatives, negotiate and struggle hard to fight for the survival of the motherland and extend justice to mankind. This association represents the people of the whole country to offer comfort and wishes for good health. Chang Jun Guang, Zuo Hua, Long Xiang San, Chen Zhen Quan, Xie Shi Nai, Dong 　Sheng, Zhang Zhi Yuan, Feng Guo, Tu Liang, K."</p>
<h3>Muslim Association Appeals to the League of Nations Electric</h3>
<p>The China National Muslim Association yesterday telegraphed Dr. Gu Weijun in Geneva, forwarding a message to Sir Drummond, Secretary-General of the League of Nations, saying: "We, the 50 million Chinese Muslims, respectfully request the League of Nations to quickly and fairly resolve the Three Eastern Provinces case, thereby maintaining world peace. We support the government and will recover the northeastern provinces occupied by the Japanese. We are prepared for any sacrifice and will not stop until we achieve our goal."</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Thanks Local Association Telegram</h3>
<p>Local associations and other groups in this city have jointly telegraphed to express their condolences to Representative Gu. Yesterday, Director Zhang Xianglin of the Chinese Representative Office of the former League of Nations Investigation Team received a telegram from Dr. Gu, asking him to forward it to the local association. The original telegram read: "To the Shanghai Municipal Local Association, thank you for your telegram. Reply in particular." Mr. Zhang has already forwarded the original telegram.</p>
<h3>Da Mei Evening News on the Future of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Da Mei Evening News commented yesterday on the way for the League of Nations to survive, making many clear and decisive contributions, saying in brief that the League of Nations General Assembly's future actions on the Manchurian case will be the most important decision since its establishment, and everyone asks about it. Moreover, in terms of its nature, it may not only be heavy, but will also become the most dangerous decision. Whether it acts on this case or not, it may depreciate the status of the League of Nations to a village debate. Whether it can withstand the ordeal and not be annihilated depends on whether it can show the courage of the courage or just be convenient. The danger of expressing courage is obvious. According to newspaper records, Tokyo has taken a challenging attitude towards the League of Nations, but it should not be ignored for the sake of the League of Nations. If it blindly accepts Japan's views on the Lytton report, it is directly abandoning its own impartial report of the investigation team and succumbing to the views of one of the parties, which will permanently lose the right to deal with such events in the future. In our opinion, the terrible results that the outside world has envisioned after the League of Nations refuses the Japanese intimidation are all biased and exaggerated. If Japan implements its stubborn and challenging plan to oppose the League of Nations, it is actually opposing the whole world. As a result, the League of Nations may not be harmed, but Japan will bring about its own collapse. This layer or Tokyo knows better. However, the most important thing at present is, on the other hand, not whether the League of Nations will be harmed after being stubbornly resisted by the Japanese, but really thinking about the League of Nations itself. If it abandons the path of complete courage and impartiality and takes other attitudes, can it bear the consequences? We firmly believe that if the League of Nations General Assembly can adhere to the Lytton report and resolutely implement the actions it deems necessary, it will encounter a violent storm, but it can still pass safely. If it succumbs to the intimidation of one of the parties, it will be completely sunk into the abyss, and there will be no trace of its existence.</p>
<h3>The Support Association E-Comforts Su Feng's Two Armies</h3>
<p>Each Receives 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency said that the Shanghai Northern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association telegraphed Generals Su Hanzhang and Feng Shoushan yesterday, asking them to encourage the entire army to bravely kill the enemy and jointly instigate harassment behind enemy lines. The following are the original texts of the telegrams:</p>
<h3>To Su Hanzhang Dian Hailar Su Bingwen Si</h3>
<p>Lingxun Jian, I have received General Zhu Jing's telegram, knowing that the previous 10,000 yuan for the army has been received by Taiwan. Recently, the League of Nations held a meeting, and the ugly attitude of the Japanese invaders was fully exposed. The hatred for the volunteer army is increasing day by day. This time, they invaded northern Manchuria, relying on Taiwan to contact the Ma army and resist with all their strength. The Wowei are defeated, and the great achievements are extremely admirable. The 79th Standing Committee Meeting has decided to allocate another 10,000 yuan to support your department, which will still be remitted according to the previous method. Please check and receive the receipts, and please send them to the post office as soon as possible. Also, please encourage the entire army to bravely kill the enemy. The association will do its best to provide assistance. Special electricity arrives, waiting for victory, Northern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association Standing Directors Chu Fucheng, Li Cishan, Yin Zhufu, Wu Shan, Feng Shaoshan, Yu Huancheng, Yan Zhifang, etc. together, Qin,</p>
<h3>To Feng Shoushan Dian Rebian Feng Zhanhai Commander</h3>
<p>Xunjian, I know everything about the telegram. The previous allocation of 7,000 yuan to support your department is only to express our responsibilities. There is no need to thank you. Recently, the League of Nations held a meeting, and the ugly attitude of the Japanese invaders was fully exposed. The hatred for the volunteer army is increasing day by day. The Su Ma two armies in northern Manchuria have been severely oppressed and should be flanked and contained to break the conspiracy. Your department has been fighting in Jiliao, and your military prestige has been established. I dare to ask you to quickly mobilize and move your troops to the east, to sensuously attack □□ or take □□, so that the enemy has worries behind them. Our army's combat equipment is not enough, relying entirely on courage to defeat the enemy. Unify and jointly mobilize to make the enemy exhausted, so as to recover the lost land. The association has now decided to allocate 10,000 yuan for the opening expenses of your department, and will immediately remit it when the mobilization is scheduled. This electricity arrives first, waiting for good news, (same name above)</p>
<h3>Sino-Korean Allied Forces Battle Report</h3>
<p>Siping Street is Restored, Erdaogou is a Great Victory</p>
<p>Huatong News Agency said that the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Sino-Korean Allied Forces Office in Shanghai received telegrams from various fronts yesterday, reporting on the recent battles, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Sino-Korean Joint Association Front Command Li Dianyich restored Siping Street. After restoring Qingyuan City on the 16th of this month, the enemy fled to Siping Street, Dongfeng County. Before long, the enemy was replenished and launched a counterattack from Da Kala (Dongfeng County) towards the flank of our army. The first commander of our army, Guan Xiangyang, hurriedly ordered Ai Dongli, the commander of the second brigade under his command, to lead more than 3,700 troops to attack the left side of the enemy from Xiaochengzi to Da Kala, and ordered Bing Guizhao, the commander of the first brigade, to lead more than 3,000 troops to attack Siping Street to cut off the enemy's retreat. After two days and nights of bloody battles, the enemy was defeated and retreated to Xifeng. Our army occupied Siping Street on the 20th. In this battle, more than 50 enemies were killed, dozens were injured, more than ten war horses, more than 50 rifles, 34 iron hats, and a box of bullets were seized. Our army sacrificed two company and platoon leaders and more than 30 soldiers. However, the enemy army was brutal by nature and massacred more than 70 of our people before retreating.</p>
<p>The Sino-Korean Allied Forces West Road Division Commander Jin Guobin fought a major battle in Erdaogou, leading more than 5,000 troops to defend Erdaogou. Suddenly, on the night of the 18th of this month, more than 1,000 Japanese troops launched a sneak attack. By dawn, the Japanese army added more than 2,000 reinforcements and three aircraft to help the battle. Our army resisted with all its might. After three days and nights of bloody battles, Commander Lao Beifeng of the Sino-Korean Allied Forces also sent more than 2,000 reinforcements to participate in the battle. The local people also rose up together and fought the Japanese army with knives and axes. The Japanese army was defeated and retreated. At that time, a Japanese aircraft was shot down. The local people also seized the return route from behind the enemy, so the Japanese army died in large numbers. In this battle, countless enemies were killed, and our army seized 35 rifles and 8 short guns. The people also seized many Japanese guns and bullets. Our army sacrificed 18 soldiers and injured 21 people.</p>
<p>More than 100 Shanghai people joined the Shanghai people.</p>
<p>They are trapped by the Sino-Korean Allied Forces and the remnants of the enemy outside the Sai, and their power is shaking the world. Therefore, they also automatically signed up to join the brave group of the army and prepared to kill the enemy. Wei Bofu, the director of the political training office in Shanghai, is stepping up training to prepare for departure as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications Recovers China Merchants Bureau Shares</p>
<h3>Scheduled to be Implemented Next Month</h3>
<p>Chen Fumu Has Arrived in Shanghai News</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency said that the news about the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau was continued by the Guowen News Agency reporter yesterday as follows:</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Communications Ordered to Draft Reorganization Methods</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that the bureau is China's only shipping agency. If it is not urgently reorganized, it will not be able to develop shipping affairs. The board of directors of the bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Communications, ordering it to draft a reorganization plan and submit it to the ministry for approval. After receiving the order, the board of directors immediately informed General Manager Liu to order various departments to draft a solid reorganization plan for submission to the Ministry of Communications for filing. This clause was notified by General Manager Liu last Saturday, limiting the time to ten days to draft and report to the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Share Repurchase Implemented at the Beginning of the Month</h3>
<p>The reporter received reliable news from the bureau yesterday that the Ministry of Communications has prepared funds to recover the bureau's commercial shares. The Ministry of Communications has long announced the method. Later, the board of directors of the bureau telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to revise it. Now it has revised and detailed the method and still set December 1 as the date for the Central Bank of Shanghai to handle the recovery matters. As for the share price, it is still set at 50 taels of silver per set. The Ministry of Communications once increased the recovery value based on the application of the shareholders, but generally increased the share price due to various reasons. The detailed method re-ordered by the Ministry of Communications will be published soon.</p>
<p>Nanjing Electric said that the 11 articles of the stock recovery method drafted by the China Merchants Bureau Board of Directors have been revised and approved by the Ministry of Communications and promulgated by the Ministry. The stock recovery period is set from the first day of next month to February 28 next year. The Central Bank of Shanghai will handle the stock collection and payment matters.</p>
<h3>Chen Fumu Has Arrived in Shanghai Said</h3>
<p>The former supervisor of the bureau, Chen Fumu, had signed a deposit contract with the former general manager, Li Guojie. Now Li is in Shanghai Hospital for treatment, while Chen is staying in Hong Kong. Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua has repeatedly called Chen</p>
<h3>The China Merchants Bureau is Cutting Staff on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>Li's Abuse of Appointment of More Than 100 People, All Eliminated</p>
<p>One hundred and six people were given salaries in four methods</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau has been nationalized, and the newly appointed General Manager Liu Hongsheng is reorganizing the bureau in a practical way. The redundant staff in the bureau have been abused by Li Guojie after taking office. Most of them are sitting and collecting dry salaries. Now Liu Manager has implemented the elimination, which has been published, and the details are publicly stated as follows:</p>
<p>The bureau's staff used to be only 170 people. After Li's tenure, more than 100 people were abused, costing a huge amount of public funds. Liu Hongsheng first eliminated redundant staff and saved expenses for the reorganization of the bureau. The criteria for selecting and eliminating staff was proposed by Liu Xiang's Standing Supervisory Committee. All those who were appointed during Li's tenure, regardless of who they were, would be eliminated. Four methods were also discussed and decided: those who have been appointed but have not yet taken office will not be paid; those who have taken office but have not yet set a salary will be given a salary; those who have taken office for less than one month will be given the salary for this month; those who have been in office for more than one month will be given a resignation salary for one month in addition to this month's salary, but only for those who are in the bureau.</p>
<p>General Manager Liu issued a notice of dismissal, saying that the bureau has a large number of people in the takeover volume, which is really redundant. At this time, the bureau's debts are piled up and the finances are exhausted. We must strictly implement the austerity policy and eliminate them separately. This general manager has not been in office for a long time, and is strictly assessing all the bureau's staff. Those with the shallowest qualifications, all the staff who arrived in the bureau in 21 years should be eliminated. Among these staff, there are those who have been appointed but have not yet taken office, those who have taken office but have not been approved for salary by Li Qian Manager, those who have been in office for less than one month, and those who have been in office for more than one month. The methods after the elimination are specified (see the above article). After being discussed and approved by the Standing Council, the dismissed personnel should be dismissed from their duties on the same day (omitted below).</p>
<p>The number of people dismissed this time are all those who entered the bureau in 21 years, including Sun Disan, Cao Zijia, Sun Chen, Qian Chengxu, Zhou Shuxiao, Zhang Wennong, Zhou Chengfu, Huang Minghao, Wang Jiwu, Shi Chunhui, Zhang Yiming, Cai Zhongwei, Gu Taili, Zou Luan, and Chen Lai, Ji Xiaozhou, Li Wu, He Weiping, etc., a total of 106 people. Yesterday, the accounting department was verifying and issuing salaries. Each department also dismissed the eliminated personnel according to the order, and posted the names of each person. There are still 174 original staff members left in the bureau.</p>
<p>The Deputy Chief of the Committee for Appointment of the Vice Chief of the Business Department Zhou Houkun is conscientious in his work. He and the Chief Wang Tong are members who do not follow the secular trend during Li's tenure. They are valued by the new General Manager Liu. Except that Wang Tong firmly resigns and cannot be retained, Deputy Chief Zhou Houkun is both on the dismissal list and on the other hand, the new General Manager also issues a letter of appointment to continue to serve as Deputy Chief. Therefore, Zhou Jun is the only one left among the staff in 21 years.</p>
<p>Recover the certificates Li Guojie abused the names of secret investigation, investigation, and special investigation during his tenure, and the salaries ranged from 50 yuan to 300 yuan. They were all used to place confidants. Now they are all cancelled. All the certificates and receipts taken by the secret investigation and investigation personnel, as well as uniforms, have been instructed to be recovered by the competent department of each department as soon as possible to avoid omissions and accidents.</p>

<p>'s order to return to Beijing to close the case in person, repeatedly 　 to explore, and could not find Chen's whereabouts. Yesterday, the shipping community suddenly spread the news that Chen had already arrived in Shanghai. After hearing the news, the reporter made inquiries everywhere, but could not find his whereabouts. Although inquiries were made to important staff members of the China Merchants Bureau, they did not discuss the matter after all. Another message said that Chen arrived in Shanghai on the President Cleveland of the Dalae Company. According to the investigation results, he could not be found in Lingyun</p>

<h3>A pleasant trip to Jiaoshan</h3>
<p>On the 27th at noon, the Jiangsu Provincial Government committees hosted a banquet for the entire delegation in Boxian Park. Chairman Gu Zhutong of Jiangsu Province changed to Dong Xiujia, Director of the Construction Department, to deliver a welcome speech on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek, who was on his way to Hankou. Simpson gave a reply, and Zhang Shouyong and Xide Jiong also reported. Finally, the representative of the Jiangsu National Disaster Relief Association stood up and delivered a speech from the standpoint of the people, petitioning the Jiangsu Provincial authorities to pay attention to the protection of the dikes. He cited the houses built on the dikes and the coffins placed on both sides, which he had seen during the inspection, and asked the government to order the residents to relocate and bury the coffins elsewhere. Dong expressed his sincere acceptance and his efforts to maintain them. At two o'clock, the hosts and guests dispersed happily. At this time, Lin Kanghou and his wife Hu Junzhuang had already taken a long-distance bus from Hongqiao Town to Yangzhou for sightseeing. Those who participated in the provincial government banquet decided to travel to Jiaoshan. At three o'clock, they set off on the Jiangli wheel. The military band and the police escorted them as usual. The cameraman of the Star Film Company also went out on the wheel at the invitation of the Disaster Relief Association. He took pictures all the way and was very interested. After arriving at Jiaoshan, he visited Huiding Temple and visited the ancient objects such as the Six Dynasties Pine, Zhou Ding, Fubo Drum, and Yang Wenxiang's Jade Belt. The abbot monk and Mr. Zhang Shouyong explained to the Western guests in detail, who were very interested. Then, they climbed the mountain and enjoyed the panoramic view. Finally, they went to Jiaoshan Building for tea. The Western guests bought a lot of rubbings, all of whom were complete outsiders, driven by curiosity. At five o'clock, they returned to the wheel after a tired tour, and it was already dark.</p>
<h3>Wen Tsung-yao's Lecture</h3>

That evening, Mr. Wen recounted his experiences traveling in India in past years, along with the extraordinary customs and traditions of Tibet, painting a vivid picture that held everyone's attention. When Mr. Wen described Tibet's custom of polyandry and the markers used to indicate who one would share a bed with, the entire room erupted in laughter. Mr. Chen, on the other hand, spoke about the history of Chinese salt, ultimately focusing on the origins of the salt tax and the economic policies of Guan Zhong. Mr. Chen, who formerly served as the Minister of Finance, could be said to have stuck closely to his area of expertise. At 9:30 PM, films were shown, including those depicting the flood disaster and comedic scenes from the Shanghai war. The screenings concluded at 11 PM.

They petitioned the government to revise it in a timely manner, increase import duties on cotton textiles, and allow representatives to offer suggestions.

<h3>Discussing the Allocation and Loan of the British Boxer Indemnity for Road Construction</h3>
<p>The Disposal Status of the Accumulated Portion</p>
<p>The Plan for the Portion That Will Become Due Has Also Been Determined.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the public is largely unaware of the details of the British Boxer Indemnity issue. A Central News Agency reporter took advantage of Tseng Chung-ming's visit to Shanghai on the train yesterday to conduct an interview and inquire in detail. According to Mr. Tseng, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity was resolved in the 19th year of the Republic, and the exchange of notes stipulated four principles of application, mainly to serve as China's educational and cultural fund, which could be borrowed for reorganizing and constructing China's railways and for undertaking other productive enterprises. The Third Plenary Session of the Second Central Committee, considering the increasing number of refunded Boxer Indemnities from various countries, resolved that two-thirds would be used for railway expenses and one-third for water conservancy and electrical expenses. The Ministry has used this as the basis for the Indemnity it should receive. The total amount of the British Boxer Indemnity refund is approximately £11,186,500. The Ministry should receive two-thirds, or £7,450,000. From December 1922 to February of this year, the Ministry has received approximately £2,130,000, the two-thirds share of the London Boxer Indemnity. Of this, £1,210,000 has already been allocated for various railways. The remaining £920,000 has also been designated for the Tongxi, Xiang'e, Guangshao, and Zhushao Railways. Furthermore, from March of last year to February of this year, the Ministry should receive over 1,056,000 yuan, and over 1,430,000 yuan has already been loaned out, leaving only over 120,000 yuan. This is the disposal status of the accumulated portion of the British Boxer Indemnity received by the Ministry. As for the portion that will become due, the Ministry has also formulated a distribution plan. From March 1933 to December 1936, the domestic and foreign Indemnity due will be approximately £1,520,000, which is planned to be directly allocated for the Zhushao section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. From January 1937 to December 1946, the domestic Indemnity due will be approximately £1,600,000, which is planned to be used as a fund to issue £1,200,000 in public bonds, with the actual proceeds given to the Zhushao section to cover domestic construction costs. From January 1937 to December 1946, the London Indemnity due will be approximately £1,600,000, which is planned to be used as a fund to issue £1,200,000 in public bonds, with the actual proceeds retained by the Zhushao section for material purchases. This proposed loan allocation of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity to serve as a fund for issuing Guangdong-Hankou Railway public bonds has been approved by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees, and the Ministry has drafted a plan and submitted it for review, including fifteen detailed measures, using the entire Guangdong-Hankou Railway as collateral, with the Ministry assuming full responsibility. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees will hold a preparatory meeting on the 3rd of next month and a formal meeting on the 5th. This loan proposal will be formally approved by the board. As for the issue of completing the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, only the Zhuzhou to Lechang section remains unbuilt. The engineering costs for this section are 27,500,000 yuan, equivalent to approximately £1,617,000, and the material costs are £2,145,000, for a total of £3,762,000. The Zhuzhou to Lechang section will be completed over four years, starting next year. In addition to allocating the Ministry's due Indemnity and paying interest, the shortfall in engineering and material costs will amount to a total of £2,376,863. This shortfall will be covered by future public bond issues. As for the Guangshao section, the remaining engineering and material costs, as well as debt repayment, amount to a total of 1,500,000 yuan. Aside from the borrowed Indemnity of 700,000 yuan, an additional 800,000 yuan is still needed. It is planned to order the Guangshao Railway to provide assistance in installments, with the goal of completing the railway for traffic in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Suspicious Case of a Young Girl's Aggrieved Spirit Crying Tragically</h3>
<p>The Academia Sinica Will Transfer All Items</p>
<p>to the Shanghai Special District Court for Examination</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch: In the suspicious case of a young girl's aggrieved spirit crying tragically at Xianqin Temple in Yixing, the bloody clothes and skeletal remains unearthed were sent by the Yixing County Government to the Academia Sinica for chemical testing.

<p>Ministry of Industry's Plan</p>
<h3>Establishing a National Textile Factory</h3>
<p>The Location of the Steel Factory Still Requires Consideration</p>
<p>Paper Mill and Nitric Acid Plant Also Actively Underway</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Ministry of Industry's plan to establish a national textile factory is already underway. It has been learned that a man claiming to be a Brazilian named Weida visited He Zhuoxian, the Director of the Trademark Bureau, the day before yesterday, stating that he possesses extensive knowledge and experience in textiles and wishes to serve China's textile industry, requesting an introduction to Minister Chen. Mr. He reported the situation to Minister Chen and arranged an introduction. As for the news published in the Shanghai Daily News the day before yesterday regarding this matter, it was quite inaccurate. According to Mr. He, the location of the steel factory being planned by the Ministry of Industry still requires careful consideration before a decision can be made. The contract for this item can be signed early next month. The planning and establishment of the paper mill and nitric acid plant are also actively underway.</p>
<h3>Customs Will Inspect Airline Luggage</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hankou air route of the China National Aviation Corporation has traditionally been inspected by personnel dispatched by the local garrison command at the takeoff and landing points in Shanghai and Hankou. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, deeply concerned that unlawful passengers may still be carrying contraband, has ordered customs offices in Shanghai, Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou to dispatch customs officers to the airport for inspection when planes arrive and depart to prevent smuggling and tax evasion and to eliminate the transportation of prohibited items. Upon receiving this instruction, the Jianghai Customs Office in Shanghai sent a letter to the company, requesting that an office be established at the airport for customs officers. According to Mr. Wu Zhaoxuan, the secretary of the company, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, the China National Aviation Corporation supports the dispatch of customs officers for inspection and has replied to comply. However, as aviation values time, delays caused by inspection would defeat the purpose of aviation. Therefore, the company needs to discuss the implementation of inspection procedures to ensure passenger convenience. As for inspecting airmail, this needs to be negotiated with the post office. It has also been learned that after the resignation of General Manager Liu Peiran was approved, the shareholders' meeting was scheduled to be held on the 2nd of next month to discuss the selection of a new general manager by the board of directors and other important matters.</p>

<h3>Flight No. 5 Safely Arrives in Dihua on Test Flight</h3>
<p>According to the Far Eastern News Agency, Eurasia Aviation Corporation received a telegram from Dihua yesterday stating that test flight No. 5 safely arrived in Dihua. It is reported that Dihua is only one stop away from Tacheng, the final station on the line. This section does not have high mountains, so the flight is easier. It is widely expected that the Eurasia line's test flight will soon be successful.</p>
<p>Aviation Construction Association</p>
<h3>Preparing for Aviation Sports Week</h3>
<p>The City's Scouts Mobilize to Promote Aviation</p>
<p>The China Aviation Construction Association previously received a telegram from Weng Zhaoyuan, its representative in the Philippines, detailing the overseas Chinese community's enthusiasm for promoting aviation sports, and that the domestic public should also show a corresponding response and echo from afar. Recently, the association convened a meeting of its members' Boy Scout team committee and decided to mobilize the entire group in early next month to go to various schools and throughout the city to expand the promotion of aviation sports. The preparatory meeting was convened at Moore Memorial Church the night before last. Over twenty people attended, including Yin Zhiling, Yao Shoukang, Zhang Fan, Xu Tong, and others from the China Aviation Construction Association, as well as Wang Gang, Leng Xueqiao, Xu Zicheng, Yu Kuiyuan, and others from the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council. It was resolved to convene a team leader meeting within this week, and assign routes, with two teams of five people each. The publicity area includes the International Settlement, the French Concession, and Nanshi. The China Aviation Association also prepared various prizes. In addition to giving each scout an airplane medal, special awards will be given based on their service performance. The officers of the general office were elected on the spot, including Wang Gang as director, Xu Zicheng as deputy director, and Leng Xueqiao as head of the organizing department, among ten others elected. It is now heard that the planning for this program is proceeding very actively. It is expected that after this publicity campaign, the Shanghai public's understanding of aviation will be clearer, and if it is extended to the whole country in the future, the whole country will know the importance of aviation to save the country.</p>

<h3>The Last Mediation of the Chinese Merchant Electric Company Labor Strike is Still Ineffective Yesterday</h3>
<p>Labor and Management Will Try to Reconcile Again</p>
<p>If Still Ineffective Tomorrow Evening, It Will Be Submitted to Arbitration</p>
<p>Regarding the labor dispute at the Chinese Merchant Electric Company, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a labor-management mediation committee at 2 PM yesterday for a final mediation. The committee members present included Hu Yida and Chuan Chongde from the labor side, Gu Xinyi and Zhang Xiaoliang from the management side, Jin Zhongjian from the Public Security Bureau, Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Wang Gang, the chairman of the committee, from the Social Affairs Bureau. Zhu Xuefan and Li Yongxiang from the General Labor Union, and Lu Bohong, the company manager, and Tan Honglin and Zhang Zhendong, the leaders of the labor union, were present as observers. First, both sides made statements, and then the discussion began, focusing on: 1. The Across-the-Board Wage Increase. The labor side insisted on an increase of 7 yuan for those earning over 40 yuan and 8 yuan for those earning below 40 yuan. The management side initially agreed to an increase of 2 yuan for those earning below 40 yuan, then agreed to 1 yuan for those earning over 40 yuan, and finally agreed to a uniform increase of 2 yuan. 2. The Allowance for Apprentices Entering the Company. The management side stated that it would establish apprentice treatment regulations and announce them in the shortest possible time. The labor side believed that the announced regulations would disappoint the workers and demanded immediate mediation. 3. The Company's Year-End Bonus Over the Years. The labor side demanded two months' pay for those who had worked for more than one year and one month's pay for those who had worked for less than one year, with the same treatment for those who resigned or were dismissed, and the same treatment for apprentices. The management side insisted on following the established practice. 4. The Pension for Staff, Retirement Fund, and Worker's Welfare and Education Fund should be combined, averaged, and distributed fairly. The management side agreed to consider and announce detailed measures. The labor side demanded immediate announcement. The chairman of the committee announced that, since the first and third items could not be mediated, they would be submitted to the Municipal Government for arbitration in accordance with the Labor Dispute Resolution Law. For the second and fourth items, after the management side announces the detailed measures, if the labor side is dissatisfied, mediation will be conducted again in accordance with the law. The labor side demanded that all four conditions be handled together, but the chairman's repeated exhortations were ineffective. The chairman then announced that the labor and management sides would try to reconcile again. If reconciliation is possible, both sides will jointly report to the competent authorities to close the case. If no resolution is reached by 5 PM on the 30th, it will be submitted to the Municipal Government for arbitration. They dispersed around 10 PM.</p>

<h3>Accountant Jiang Wanping Convenes</h3>
<p>Meeting of Creditors of Yang Qinghe Jewelry Store</p>
<p>Liquidator Proposes That Creditors Participate in the Handling</p>
<p>Yang Qinghe Jiuji Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road, due to financial difficulties, announced its liquidation on the 27th of last month, and entrusted accountant Jiang Wanping and lawyer Jiang Yiping to handle the liquidation matters on its behalf. Yesterday, the case's agents, accountant Jiang and lawyer Jiang, convened a meeting of creditors at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Xizang Road. Accountant Jiang's audit of the jewelry store's asset-liability summary table and related schedules, totaling twelve volumes, were displayed for creditors to review. Chen Longtian and Dong Chunbiao, two accounting assistants from Jiang Wanping's accounting firm, along with all the staff, were present to assist and welcome attendees. About one hundred creditors attended, and lawyers representing the creditors, including Zhang Shizhao, Chen Zemin, Jiang Baoli, Zhou Shaoqin, and Sun Dequan, were also present. First, accountant Jiang announced the purpose of the meeting, stating briefly that liquidation cases involve hundreds of people, and those directly involved are even more numerous. We should pay close attention to such cases with the principle of serving society as our main goal. Observing recent social situations, whenever liquidation cases are announced, all parties involved become overly anxious and panic unnecessarily. We should thoroughly clarify the internal situation and handling standards early to reassure the creditors. However, due to the meticulous procedures of inspecting assets and liabilities, no report can be made until completion. Therefore, the creditors' meeting is scheduled for this Sunday to report publicly. As agents in liquidation cases, although we are nominally entrusted by the parties concerned, we are actually managing the debtor's existing assets on behalf of the creditors, handling them properly, and impartially safeguarding the common interests of all creditors. Our position, according to law, is as a notary for both parties, not as representatives of one side. We cannot protect any one side. Before today's meeting, I believe that all creditors must be anxious and doubtful. After today's meeting, all creditors will have a thorough understanding of everything and can calm their minds. 2. Accountant Jiang reported on the liquidation progress. 3. Accountant Dong Chunbiao, representing accountant Jiang, reported on the asset-liability situation, with detailed explanations. The secured liabilities totaled 41,653.55 taels, and the unsecured liabilities totaled 365,992.90 taels (foreign debts were converted to silver at the rate of 70% of a tael), for a total debt of 419,870.10 taels. The total value of the existing assets was 562,087.33 taels. After deducting the jewelry store's losses of over 270,000 taels from speculative investments and bad debts and depreciation over the years, the actual assets included over 840 taels of gold and silver goods, over 15,000 taels of silver goods, buildings, business assets, goodwill, and various receivables, totaling approximately 170,000 taels. 4. Lawyer Jiang Yiping reported on the asset disposal methods, stating briefly that the method of valuing and disposing of the assets is very important for creditors. We should solicit public opinions and devise perfect methods. Gold and silver goods are a particularly important part of the existing assets. We should either adopt large-scale discounts for public retail sales, or hand over the original items to banks, or melt them for sale. Please discuss these methods together. We would also like to have several representatives elected by the creditors to jointly handle the gold and silver goods with this lawyer and accountant Jiang so as to make it public and fair. 5. Discussion of Asset Disposal: (A) It was resolved to accept the liquidator's suggestion that five representatives be elected by the creditors to handle the matter jointly with accountant Jiang and lawyer Jiang. The creditor representatives elected were lawyer Zhang Shizhao, lawyer Chen Zemin, Yu Jiaming, Qian Xiangjiu, and Ju Minzai. (B) Buildings. (C) Business assets. (D) Goodwill. It was resolved that B, C, and D would be handled together, and accountant Jiang and lawyer Jiang would expedite negotiations for their sale. 6. The Collection and Prosecution of Debts. It was resolved that accountant Jiang and lawyer Jiang would handle the matter. 7. Dismissal of Employees. It was resolved to resolve the matter quickly according to custom in order to save expenses. 8. Handling of Debts. It was resolved to handle the matter according to law. 9. Discussion of Methods When Assets Are Insufficient to Cover Debts. Accountant Jiang presented the jewelry store's capital book, and it was resolved to handle the matter according to law. The meeting concluded at 1 PM.</p>
<h3>Communist Leaders Gather</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Learned of It and Went to Arrest Them</p>
<p>Yang Kaishan and Six Others Were Arrested</p>
<p>Wen Hong'en, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently received a confidential report from the Investigation Section that communist leaders Yang Kaishan, Zhao Xiangzhi, Jiang Zhenguo, Huang Shoushan, and others were holding a meeting of communist cadres at 21 Hengshou Lane, Hengtong Road, Zhabei, yesterday morning, plotting illicit activities. He reported it and requested an arrest warrant. Upon receiving the report, Director Wen immediately ordered the Supervisory Office to dispatch inspectors and local police to make the arrest. As the party was holding a meeting, Yang Kaishan and six others were captured, and a large number of reactionary publications, as well as gun parts and bullet casings, were seized and submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for prosecution.</p>
<p>Notorious Robber</p>
<h3>Zhou Yiwen Executed by Hanging</h3>
<p>The notorious robber Zhou Yiwen (also known as Meng Xiaozhou) from Funing, Jiangbei, was involved in an incident in January of the year before last when he led a gang armed with weapons intending to commit unlawful acts. Chinese Constable No. 875 from the Harbin Police Department noticed their suspicious behavior on Dengtuo Road and approached them for questioning. Zhou opened fire, resisting arrest and killing the constable. As a result, Zhou and several of his accomplices were arrested by the detectives and taken to the Eighth Police Department. It was discovered that Zhou and others had committed nine robberies within the jurisdiction. They were sent to the First Special Court for trial and sentencing. Zhou Yiwen was sentenced to death, and the other robbers were punished accordingly. The sentence was reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval. Yesterday afternoon, the execution date arrived. At around 2 PM, the police escorted Zhou to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court, where Judge Shen Shanzeng took the bench and asked Zhou if he had any last words. According to Zhou, he was 34 years old and his original name was Meng Xiaozhou. Since he had no relatives in Shanghai, there was no need for him to write a letter. He looked around as if he was trying to find someone. Judge Shen ordered him sent to the Local Court for verification. Chinese and foreign police officers then took Zhou down, along with the case files and photos, and escorted him onto a car, which drove directly to the Caohejing execution ground. At the same time, the Local Court was notified, and the prosecutor and bailiffs arrived at the scene. As Zhou was convicted of murder, he was executed by hanging. According to regulations, the corpse will be displayed overnight and will be collected for burial today.</p>
<p>Textile Factory</p>
<h3>The Bed and Matting Cannot Accommodate Each Other</h3>
<p>Resentment Increases Due to Salary Increase</p>
<p>Hu Zhigang Murders with a Knife</p>
<p>Ding Jintang Severely Injured</p>
<p>Attempted Suicide Backfires, Claiming a Life</p>
<p>At approximately 1:40 AM yesterday, a murder occurred at the Shen Hsin No. 1 Textile Factory, located at No. 468 Yangshupu Road. According to reports, the factory employed two *chàng xí* (bed and matting, referring to colleagues) workers, one named Hu Zhigang, 25 years old, and the other named Ding Jintang, 23 years old, both from Wuxi. Although they were colleagues, their personalities clashed, so they rarely interacted. Hu was young and impetuous, often making things difficult for others, especially Ding. However, Ding always ignored him. Hu became even more tyrannical, seeing Ding's concession as a sign of weakness and verbally abused him to his face. Ding still endured it. This spring, the factory increased salaries as usual. Considering that Hu and Ding had the same job responsibilities, the factory decided to pay them the same salary. Hu's original salary was 16 yuan, and he received an increase of 4 yuan. Ding's original salary was 12 yuan, and he received an increase of 8 yuan. Unexpectedly, Hu believed that Ding was cunning and persuaded the factory to treat them differently. As a result, Hu harbored even deeper resentment towards Ding and constantly thought of revenge. However, Ding was unaware of this. At approximately 1:40 AM yesterday, all the factory employees were asleep. Suddenly, Hu Zhigang emerged from his dormitory, Room 212, carrying a sharp knife. He went straight to Ding's dormitory, Room 208, opened the door, and entered. At the time, Ding was sound asleep and did not notice Hu wielding the knife and stabbing him violently. He woke up in pain and realized that Hu had pinned him down, preventing him from moving. He shouted loudly from under the covers, waking up his roommates. They got up and saw Hu standing in front of Ding's bed, holding a sharp knife with a furious expression. Ding was rolling on the side of the bed, calling for help, and the blanket was stained with blood. The roommates immediately took Ding to Shanghai General Hospital for treatment. At the same time, they contacted the security guard to report the incident to the police station after dawn. However, while the employees were in a state of confusion, they suddenly saw blood coming out of Hu's orifices and his face turning pale. They quickly questioned him, and Hu confessed that he had taken an antidepressant before committing the crime. The colleagues, upon learning this, quickly sent Hu to Shanghai East Hospital for treatment. However, the poison had been ingested for too long and had seeped into his bloodstream, making it impossible to save him. The hospital reported the death to the Yulin Road Police Station, who transported the body to the Fei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the court was requested to conduct an autopsy. It was also learned that Ding's injuries were quite severe, and it was uncertain whether he would survive.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Planning to Establish a Department Store</h3>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Relaxation of Chinese Boycott</p>
<p>Implementing a Dumping Policy of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Preparing for a Scheduled Opening</p>
<p>Japanese goods have been successfully dumped in China, and imports have gradually returned to their pre-September 18th state. The goods stored in Shanghai warehouses have been gradually cleared. Japanese merchants are taking it a step further by planning to establish a Japanese department store in Shanghai, specializing in the sale of Japanese products, as a fundamental policy to maximize the distribution of inferior goods. Preparations have been completed, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Northern Fortune Company, orchestrated by Japanese merchants, has a great commercial influence in Shanghai. Before the January 28th Incident, it established the Shishan Glass Factory, the Northern Fortune Soda Factory, and so on. During the war, it had to suspend operations because it was within the line of fire. Now that Japanese merchants in Shanghai are gradually resuming business, the Northern Fortune Company is also planning to resume operations. Recently, it was orchestrated by Yokotake, a Japanese commercial official stationed in Shanghai. To facilitate the sales of Japanese goods, he discussed with Northern Fortune Company the establishment of a large department store in Shanghai, raising one million yuan, specializing in the sale of goods produced throughout Japan. Yokotake has already contacted factories in Japan to arrange for the goods to be shipped to Shanghai as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The location for this large department store has been determined by Northern Fortune Company, Yokotake, and others at the corner of Miller Road and Minhang Road. It will be named the Northern Fortune Department Store, specializing in the sale of Japanese products. Goods from other countries will not be sold, as its aim is to take advantage of the waning Chinese boycott movement to develop outlets for Japanese goods. It also aims to sell at low prices and has set the official opening date for December 15th. Currently, they are arranging the store and stocking the shelves.</p>
<p>The store will be very large and comprehensive, with a wide variety of goods, including grains, Western-style pastries, seafood, ceramics, enamelware, woolen textiles, cotton textiles, hemp products, clothing, toys, leather goods, stationery, medicines, tobacco and alcohol, metal products, jewelry, and various other items. Even products from Hokkaido will be transported to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<p>Yangtze River Navigation Facilities</p>
<h3>To Continue to be Managed by Customs</h3>
<p>The jurisdiction over navigation facilities along the Yangtze River, such as lighthouses and buoys, which was disputed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Transportation, has now been reviewed by the Central Political Conference. It was unanimously agreed that these navigation facilities are related to national tax revenue and navigation convenience and have been managed by the Customs for a long time, with a well-established system and outstanding results. Therefore, the Customs should continue to manage them. The Executive Yuan of the National Government has been ordered to comply. The Shanghai General Tax Office has also received the instruction.</p>
<p>Road Extension Dispute</p>
<h3>Transformed into a Dispute between Britain and Japan</h3>
<p>Over the Issue of Appointing a Japanese Deputy Police Chief versus a British One</p>
<p>The British Side Considers the Municipal Council as a Whole Organization</p>
<p>The road extension issue in the Shanghai International Settlement has been stalled due to Japanese opposition. There is still no new progress on the matter. However, according to information obtained by a reporter from the *Xinsheng She* (New Sound News Agency) yesterday, the case has already evolved from a dispute between the Municipal Council and the Japanese side into a dispute between Britain and Japan. According to a Japanese official spokesperson speaking to the reporter, the case is currently being negotiated among the Japanese Consul Ishiya, the British Consul Brenan, and the Director-General of the Municipal Council, Fessenden, but there has been no significant progress. The spokesperson stated that what the Japanese side is demanding is the issue of the Deputy Police Chief. The agreement stipulates that the Police Chief should be Chinese and the Deputy Police Chief should be British. The Japanese side insists that a Japanese national should be appointed as Deputy Police Chief based on the proportion of the number of Japanese residents in Shanghai, the number of British residents in Shanghai, and the qualifications for paying taxes. The spokesperson did not mention whether the Japanese government had any new instructions but said that the Japanese side attaches great importance to this point. If this point is resolved, then everything else will not be a problem, and the signing can be implemented immediately. The British side's attitude is that the Municipal Council is a whole organization, without distinguishing between the number of Japanese residents and the number of British residents.</p>

<h3>*Song Bao* Continues Publication in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Letter to the County Government Declares Intention</p>
<p>After being forced to cease publication, the composing room of *Songjiang Song Bao* was also monitored by police sent by the authorities, making printing impossible. Yesterday, the paper moved to No. 278 Huile Lane, Yunnan Road, Shanghai, to continue editing and publishing. At the same time, a letter was sent directly to the Songjiang County Government Public Security Bureau declaring its intention to resume publication, in order to comply with procedures. The newspaper's official letter is excerpted as follows: "Respectfully, at 10:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, Chen Shuliang, Inspector-General of the Public Security Bureau, and Jiang Xiawu, patrol officer of the Second Sub-Station, ordered our newspaper to cease publication and sent police to monitor the composing room, prohibit mailing, and arrest newspaper employees. As for the reasons for ordering the cessation of publication, the officials stated that they were acting on a confidential order from your government. Under this authority, our newspaper, unable to withstand the pressure, ceased publication on the 23rd, awaiting further instructions from your government. However, after waiting until now, no signs have emerged. The public is suspicious and unable to fathom the depth of the situation. However, given this extra-legal destruction, our newspaper finds it difficult to remain silent. After consideration by our colleagues, rather than suffering extra-legal sanctions and inviting criticism from the world, it is better to continue publication to demonstrate the spirit of the rule of law. Therefore, in addition to continuing publication and reporting to our superiors, we are sending this letter for your information."</p>
<h3>Fire in the French Concession This Morning</h3>
<p>Fire at Tianfu Store</p>
<p>Spreads to Several Neighbors</p>
<p>At 0:15 AM this morning, a fire suddenly broke out on the ground floor of the Tianfu Run Department Store at No. 8, the intersection of Jixiang Street and Sanyangjing Bridge in the French Concession. At the time, the neighbors and the store's employees were already asleep, so they did not notice the fire until it reached the stairs, waking them from their dreams. At the same time, the neighbors were also awakened and fled in panic. Before long, flames erupted through the roof. The nearby police reported to the French Concession Fire Brigade, which quickly dispatched fire engines to the scene to put out the fire. However, the wind was strong, and the fire spread rapidly with the wind, engulfing the neighboring houses. Nos. 6 Fuxinglong Leather Suitcase Store, 10 Dongwanyu General Merchandise Store, 12 Zhou Shunjiyang Iron Store, and 14 Zhou Shunxiang Department Store were all affected. The situation quickly became uncontrollable. Fire engines from various sections also rushed to help put out the fire.

The firefighters were working hard to put out the fire, hoping to prevent it from spreading further.</p>

<p>Building Association</p>
<h3>Diligent Study of Architectural Science</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Architectural Association is a group of the Shanghai architectural community. Its purpose is to study academics and improve the architectural industry. In addition to compiling and publishing the Architectural Monthly, which contains specialized disciplines of architectural construction and structural drawings, the association has organized an architectural academic discussion meeting to seek concrete improvements. It widely solicits those with rich knowledge and experience in architecture to join the discussion, in order to gather ideas and achieve great results. People such as Mr. Shen Yi, Yang Ximou, Zhao Shen, Zhuang Jun, Zhang Xiaoliang, Qian Shaoping, Li Keng, Li Mengbo, Dong Dayou, Tang Jingxian, Ben Yan Geng, etc., are all on the invitation list. Their future achievements will be extremely impressive. The first step of the association's discussion is to determine the names of architectural technologies and materials. The architecture in various parts of our country is complex and inconsistent. Moreover, architectural materials from Europe and the United States have new products every day. Our country initially had no fixed names and called them by their original names. As new products increase, difficult and obscure names become even more mixed, which is indeed an obstacle to the future of the architectural industry. The association, in view of this, plans to discuss it as soon as possible. After a definite name is decided, it will be announced to the national architectural community for unified adoption in order to unify and facilitate improvement.</p>
<h3>Wu Shaoda's Reactionary Suspicion, Declared Not Guilty After Retrial</h3>
<p>Wu Shaoda from Shaoxing was arrested last year in the French Concession by Chinese and foreign detectives of the French Police Political Department on suspicion of participating in the Communist Party's reactionary activities. He was sent to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and prosecuted for endangering the Republic of China. Wu hired lawyers Wang Shizong and others to defend him. He was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. Wu refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal to the Supreme Court, which was sent back for retrial. The Third Branch of the Higher Court received the case file. Because this case was a special case, the Party Department dispatched members to the court to participate in the jury according to regulations. Therefore, it notified the Shanghai Municipal Party Department to send Chen Zhigao, Huang E, Zhang Jiaodao, Jiang Huaisu, Wang Deyan, Wu Zhengjue and other six members to the court. It also informed the police department's lawyer. Presiding Judge Zhou Yunhui, together with judges Guo Dezhang and Zhao Zhenhai, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, together with the jurors, specially opened the First Criminal Court and ordered the police to bring the appellant Wu Shaoda for retrial. The appellant was still defended by lawyers Wang Shizong and Yu Zhongluo. As a result, the debate was declared over. Yesterday, Wu Shaoda was declared not guilty. Subsequently, Wu was released on bail by the owner of Shusanhe Foil Shop in Ximennei Chuanqinhe.</p>

<h3>Chen Atang's Tomb Enclosed in Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the case of Chen Atang, a Puxi resident who was beaten to death by a Japanese sailor some years ago, was negotiated with the Japanese side for a long time with the assistance of lawyer Wu Kaisheng and various united groups. As a result, two Japanese sailors were sentenced by the Nagasaki Local Court to two years of imprisonment and two years of detention each, for a total of four years. At the same time, the person in charge of the Japanese side contributed 3,000 yuan as compensation for Chen Atang's family to handle the aftermath. Subsequently, Chen's wife, Ms. Song, purchased more than one mu of land in Jinjiahang, Puxi Twenty-one Tu, and filled in the graves of Chen Atang's ancestors and grandparents, a total of six graves, and buried them in that place. It has been five years. Unexpectedly, in June of this year, someone initiated the organization of the Pudong Jiu'an Cemetery in that area, enclosing 60 mu of land, all purchased from the villagers at public prices. The tomb base of Atang and others was also enclosed, and the selling price was collected by Chen Yunmei, Atang's uncle. When Chen's wife, Ms. Song, heard this news, she was greatly alarmed and invited many representatives from all walks of life to go to Pudong to negotiate with the Jiu'an Cemetery office and Chen Yunmei. As a result, Chen Yunmei wrote a guarantee, stating that after the cemetery is completed, the six graves of Atang and others will still be buried in it in the Jiu'an style. He also entrusted lawyer Wu Kaisheng to request protection and transferred a letter to inform him.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor, This newspaper reported today that the Huaxingchang Machinery Factory on Maohai Road was searched and found 45 fake guns and 47 bayonets. According to the person in charge of the factory, the fake guns were custom-made by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce School. Because the style was different from the original design, they were unwilling to ship the goods and were left in the factory. After investigation, the night school run by our association aims to study practical business academics. There is no subject of military gymnastics in the curriculum, so there is no custom-made fake guns and equipment from outside. I am deeply afraid that the factory's misinformation will cause suspicion from the outside world. I am writing to inform you and respectfully hope that your newspaper will publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column to make a statement. This is to the Shen Bao Newspaper. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, November 28.</p>
<p>To the Editor, For the sake of declaring injustice, suffering unbearable pain, and requesting (the 18th of this month) to correct your newspaper, so as to clarify right and wrong and avoid innocent suffering, my son, Zhu Adong, lives on the third floor of 162 Manchuria Road, Zhabei. The family of five makes a living by hiring workers. Unfortunately, at 4 AM on the 17th of this month, a fire broke out in the middle floor. The ladder had been broken, and there was no way to escape. Then the 14-year-old young daughter died in the fire. Those who were able to escape were all seriously injured. Then, the old man's head was severely injured and his life was uncertain. At that time, the police officers did not understand the correct situation and immediately detained the young man Zhu Adong and sent him to the court, according to what was published in your newspaper, to punish the person who caused the fire. The second floor where the fire actually started was empty, and in addition to being able to obtain special new fire insurance fees, they can enjoy themselves outside the law. Is this unfair? At present, various places have already understood the true situation that the ladder on the second floor was burned off and the 14-year-old young daughter could not escape, and she was burned to death in the fire. The truth can be investigated and verified. For this reason, I am writing to request a swift correction, based on the facts, according to justice, to prove that it was not the young man Zhu Adong who caused the fire, and according to the fact that the ladder on the second floor was burned off, it is a definite proof that the fire started, so as to avoid the young man Zhu Adong suffering innocently, and according to the fairness and impartiality of your newspaper, I respectfully submit this to the Editor of the Shen Bao Newspaper for consideration. Zhu Zhang Shi Jinzhen, November 27, 21st year.</p>

<p>Attachment 3: The Compilation and Selection of Teaching Materials Should</p>
<p>Pay attention to the following points...</p>
<p>(1) Based on the principles of our Party, teaching materials should be as rich as possible in the spirit of sacrifice and mutual assistance. All teaching materials containing selfishness, self-interest, usurpation, competition, Qing Dynasty nostalgia, backwardness, Eastern restraints, escapist ideology, aristocratic tendencies, capitalist tendencies, etc., should be avoided. Teaching materials on Party doctrine that are critical and left-leaning should be actively adopted. (i) When considering stories of Mr. Sun Yat-sen: (A) Childhood life; (B) Student life; (C) Revolutionary affairs; (D) Birth and death anniversaries; (E) Other. (ii) Regarding stories and poems about the National Revolution: (A) The national flag and party flag; (B) Various important revolutionary anniversaries (such as the Huanghuagang Uprising, the Wuchang Uprising, etc.); (D) Other. (iii) Regarding stories and poems that inspire national spirit: (A) Facts about patriotism and national revolution; (B) Facts related to the achievements and culture of the Chinese nation; (C) Important days of national humiliation; (D) Regarding the humiliation of our people and overseas Chinese by imperialists; (E) Other. (iv) Regarding stories and poems that inspire the concept of civil rights: (A) Breaking the superstition of divine power; (B) Breaking the belief in military power and the feudal ideology and remnants of feudal forces; (C) Guiding equality, mutual assistance, discipline, etc.; (D) Regarding the civil rights movement; (E) Other. (v) Regarding stories and poems that cultivate the concept of people's livelihood: (A) Labor Day and the agricultural and industrial workers' movement; (B) Regarding afforestation, agricultural improvement, and industrial movement; (C) Regarding promoting domestic goods; (D) Regarding cooperative production and cooperative consumption; (E) Other. (2) Based on the principle of increasing children's reading ability, imaginative teaching materials (such as fables, fairy tales, etc.) and realistic teaching materials (such as nature stories, life stories, historical stories, etc.) should be harmonized and balanced. All teaching materials with a terrifying nature should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
<p>(3) Based on the principle of increasing children's reading interest, teaching materials should be as artistically interesting as possible. The conditions are as follows: (i) The facts are connected consistently and not cluttered; (ii) The interest is deep and enduring, not shallow; (iii) The narration is winding and lively, not dry and rigid; (iv) The wording is sincere and earnest, not superficial and evasive; (v) The description and facts should be "consistent and harmonious," not discordant and incompatible; (vi) Use peculiar arrangements (such as birds and flowers paired together are commonplace; birds paired with songs or speech feel peculiar, making it difficult for children to infer directly); (vii) The structure is tight, complete, not loose and fragmented.</p>
<p>(4) Based on children's psychology, teaching materials should be as relevant to children's lives as possible. The conditions are as follows: (i) Children or characters close to children should be the protagonists in the teaching materials; (ii) Abstract events should be compiled into concrete fragments of facts; (iii) After reading, there should be work to do, things to imagine or research; (iv) More fairy tales, poems, and stories should be used in lower grades; (v) Arrange according to seasons so that teaching is easy to visualize at any time; (vi) The depth of the writing should be appropriate to the children's level.</p>
<p>(5) Based on the principle of using standard language to learn vernacular writing, the organization of words, etc., should be based on standard grammar. The rhyme of poetry, etc., should be based on standard phonetics.</p>
<p>Fourth, Key Teaching Points</p>
<p>(1) Speaking</p>
<p>(i) Start teaching with complete sentences, then use paragraphs of speech. (ii) Teachers should pre-compile cases as language materials. The language materials are divided into three types as follows: (A) Organized and progressive language materials. Each should have a topic, and each sentence should simply describe an action, but not be too complicated (start from one subject and be easy to see and easy to do; there should not be too many sentences in each set); (B) Conversational materials should focus on an interesting event and have an interesting topic; (C) Story language materials should contain children's literary interest and not violate Party doctrine. (iii) Speaking should be natural (not be bound by the nuances of the words), and pay attention to the difference between children's language and adult language. (iv) Speaking should be vivid and have a context. Teaching and actions should be combined with performance. It is best to have children perform the stories that have already been told. (v) Sounds or words that are easily mistaken should be spoken particularly clearly, listened to more, practiced more, and guided to correct them based on the position of pronunciation. Words with unclear meanings should be expressed using real objects, diagrams, actions, explanations, translations, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Reading</p>
<p>(vi) The sequence of material arrangement should pay attention to the following points: (A) Start with progressive and continuous picture stories, then use half-picture and half-text stories. The text of the stories used in grades 3-4 can gradually increase, and the number of pictures can gradually decrease; (B) Use complete story paragraphs to begin text teaching, instead of starting with single words and sentences. After learning the complete story paragraph, recognize sentences from the story, and then recognize words and characters from the sentences. Later, use complete paragraphs or complete articles; (C) Arrange various literary styles in a mixed manner. There should be more poetry in lower grades, and gradually reduce it in upper grades. (vii) Reading teaching should first have a general overview and then a partial analysis, first an absorption of the content and then an exploration of the form, first understanding and then memorization. (viii) The teaching of literary materials should supplement imagination in many ways, and design performances randomly to reveal the content and situation completely, so that children can fully appreciate it. (ix) In addition to intensive reading, there should be regular time to guide children to skim reading. Intensive reading teaching in lower grades emphasizes both reading aloud and silent reading. From the second grade onward, the opportunity for silent reading should be more than that for reading aloud. Teaching reading aloud should pay attention to pronunciation and intonation. Teaching silent reading should pay attention to accuracy, speed, and conciseness (that is, extracting the main points, such as dividing paragraphs and seeking key points). (x) From the second grade onward, opportunities should be taken to briefly point out the meaning of word composition (for example, "smoke" comes from mouth and is burned by fire, and "day" is the sun appearing from the horizon) to help children's memory, and briefly guide simple grammar to enhance children's reading and expression abilities. (xi) The books for skim reading should emphasize appreciation, practicality, and reference, but the proportions vary according to grade. In addition to in-class guidance, children should be encouraged to read outside of class and make reading reports. (xii) Starting from the fourth grade, children should be guided to practice taking reading notes. (3) Writing</p>
<p>(xiii) Whether oral or written, attention should be paid to the value of the content, not just focusing on the form. (xiv) Oral and written descriptions should be closely linked. For example, for the same topic, first give a speech (oral description), then write a description (written description), and then discuss and study it, or first give a speech, then write a description, or first write a description, then discuss it. (xv) In the lower grades, more auxiliary methods can be used for writing guidance; in the middle grades, more imitation methods can be used. (xvi) Develop the habit of making a rough draft. (xvii) The method of setting topics should pay attention to: (i) using opportunities to set topics; (ii) often having children set their own topics; (iii) providing multiple topics for selection. (xviii) The nature of the topics should pay attention to: (i) being relevant to children's lives; (ii) being easy for children to express themselves; (iii) being interesting. (xix) Grading should be serious and should preserve the children's original intentions as much as possible, and give children the opportunity to jointly grade and study. In the upper grades, "correction symbols" can be used to have children revise themselves. (xx) Error correction should be given more guidance. If there are major errors, the grammar and syntax that are prone to error can be fully practiced using imitation and other methods. (xxi) The guidance of syntax and grammar should use an inductive process, based on the materials already taught in the national language, and collect similar materials for comparative study. (xxii) The model for writing should be practical writing with exemplary structure (correct thinking, clear levels, proper format, etc.) and descriptive writing as the main focus. (xxiii) When starting to practice writing, children should be guided to practice diary writing.</p>
<p>(4) Calligraphy</p>
<p>(xxiv) The materials for calligraphy should initially use commonly used characters and easily mistaken characters, and record them as meaningful sentences to reduce rote memorization. (xxv) The posture for calligraphy, the application of tools, and the stroke order, structure, and position of the characters should be carefully guided from the beginning. (xxvi) Pencils should be used for calligraphy at first, for ease of manipulation. In the second grade, in addition to continuing to practice pencil writing, attention should be paid to brush training. In the fifth and sixth grades, brush calligraphy training can be added. (xxvii) Copying (or tracing), head writing (using printed calligraphy models), and free writing (without using models) should be used interchangeably. (xxviii) Regular competitions should be held from time to time.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Investigates and Recovers Education in Bandit Areas</h3>

<h3>French Concession Private School Federation</h3>
<p>Postpones Petition to French Municipal Council</p>
<p>▲ Mayor Wu Has Consulted with the French Consul</p>
<p>▲ The Municipal Education Bureau Convened a Meeting of All Committee Members Yesterday</p>
<p>▲ Ma Jia-zhen's Talk on the Federation's Minimum Demands</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Private Primary and Secondary School Federation originally planned to send all executive and supervisory committee members to the French Municipal Council yesterday to petition for the council to subsidize private schools within the concession with 20% of the total annual income. However, the federation received a notice from the Municipal Education Bureau to postpone the petition and convened a meeting of all executive and supervisory committee members to discuss the matter. After receiving the notice, all supervisory committee members went to the Municipal Education Bureau at 9:00 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ The Education Bureau's Opinion Was Received by Yan Fei-cheng, Section Chief of the Bureau, Who Expressed His Views to the Committee Members. He stated that the Bureau fully sympathized with the Federation's request for the French Municipal Council to subsidize private schools and would provide assistance. However, the Bureau believed that the petition could be postponed for the time being. The French Consul had gone to the Municipal Government to consult with Mayor Wu on the matter, and Mayor Wu had sent Secretary Geng of the Municipal Government to the Bureau to dissuade the Federation from petitioning. Yesterday, the Bureau received a letter from Mayor Wu stating that he had contacted the French Consul on the matter and had made some progress. He requested that the petition be postponed for the time being. Therefore, he had convened everyone here today to discuss the matter. The Bureau had decided to work with the Municipal Government to negotiate with the French Municipal Council and would report the results to everyone within a week, hoping to satisfy everyone. The Bureau hoped that the petition would be postponed for the time being. The Japanese believed that the Federation should only request the French Municipal Council to subsidize private schools run by Chinese, and not request the French to establish Chinese schools. The committee members then returned to the federation and decided to postpone the petition to the French Municipal Council and wait for the Municipal Government to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>▲ Ma Jia-zhen's Talk Subsequently, Ma Jia-zhen, a member of the standing committee of the federation, told a Shanghai Social News reporter that since the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Government had agreed to work with the French Municipal Council to negotiate the matter, the federation could wait for a resolution. However, he believed that the French Concession was Chinese territory and that the French Municipal Council could not treat the Chinese in the French Concession as if they were in a colony. The French Municipal Council should seek a balance in the development of education for Westerners and Chinese in the concession. According to a recent survey, the annual education expenditure per Western child was forty-four taels, while the annual education expenditure per Chinese child was only seven mace and two candareens. This disparity was shocking. Therefore, the federation demanded that the French Municipal Council develop Chinese education, and the minimum requirement was that the annual education expenditure per Chinese child should be equal to that of a Western child. He hoped that the Municipal Government and the Municipal Education Bureau would pay attention to this point.</p>

<h3>Obstacles to Next Year's National Games</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education Has Not Yet Taken Over the Central Stadium</p>
<p>The 20th-Year Preparatory Committee Is Willing to Continue Handling Matters</p>
<p>The organizational regulations and budget for the National Games, scheduled to be held at the Central Stadium in the capital during the Double Tenth Festival next year, have been reviewed and approved by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 15th of this month. At that time, it was also resolved to request the National Government to explicitly abolish the National Games Preparatory Committee of the 20th Year of the Republic and for the Ministry of Education to take over the Central Stadium. These matters have been reported in the newspapers. On the 25th of this month, the standing committee of the Ministry of Education's Education Committee, in response to the failure to establish the preparatory committee for next year's National Games, resolved that "a decision will be made after the Minister of Education consults with Chairman Lin." After investigation, the details have come to light and are summarized as follows: The construction of the Central Stadium was previously managed by the National Games Preparatory Committee of the 20th Year of the Republic. Due to the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, the entire country united against external forces, and the National Games were suspended. However, the National Games Preparatory Committee of the 20th Year of the Republic was appointed by the National Government and has not been abolished to this day. Therefore, the management rights of the Central Stadium are still in the hands of the National Games Preparatory Committee of the 20th Year of the Republic. The preparatory committee consists of more than ten members, all of whom are prominent figures in the Party and state, such as Wei Daoming, Jiang Menglin, and Wang Zhengting. Most of them have left the capital for other destinations. Therefore, the committee has not held any meetings since the September 18th Incident. A small number of staff members are stationed at the attached office in the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Administration Office to manage the Central Stadium. This time, the Ministry of Education, based on the resolutions of the National Sports Conference, stipulated that the National Games would be held at the Central Stadium during the Double Tenth Festival next year and that the ministry would separately organize a preparatory committee to manage the preparations. Since this proposal was approved by the Executive Yuan, the National Games Preparatory Committee of the 20th Year of the Republic has expressed dissatisfaction. A key figure of the standing committee of the National Games Preparatory Committee of the 20th Year of the Republic secretly ordered the Central Stadium not to be handed over to the Ministry of Education until a clear order from the National Government was received, and stated that the preparatory work for next year's National Games should still be managed by the committee. Because of this, the Executive Yuan's resolution has not been formally announced by the National Government after half a month, and the Ministry of Education will have no way to start taking over the Central Stadium and preparing for next year's National Games. As for the proposal to use the stadium to prepare for the establishment of the Central Sports Academy, it is feared that it will also be difficult to realize due to the dispute over the management rights of the stadium.</p>

<h3>New Basketball Tactics (36) (Not Permitted) (Reprinted) Claire Burcky Zhang Guodong Qian Yidong Co-Translation</h3>
<p>Coach Ralph Wole's Baylor Quintet was the 1932 American Southwest basketball</p>
<p>team. Through experience, they proved that the following tactics are the most effective weapons for attacking zone defenses and man-to-man defenses:</p>
<p>Number 3 slowly dribbles the ball forward, number 4 cuts into the free throw</p>
<p>area, receiving a pass from number 2. At the same time, number 5</p>
<p>immediately cuts across in front of number 4. When the two people (number 4</p>
<p>and number 5) approach, number 4 immediately passes the ball to</p>
<p>number 5 and blocks number 5's defender. At this time, if number 1 has</p>
<p>come out of the surveillance of his defender, then number 5</p>
<p>can pass the ball to number 1, allowing him to shoot</p>
<p>under the basket. Otherwise, he can also shoot on the spot or dribble</p>
<p>in for a shot.</p>

<h3>Financial Standard Gold Rises Sharply, Minor Retracement</h3>
<p>〓 Falls Back Two Taels and Eight Qian 〓</p>
<p>Yesterday, the upward trend in the market slowed down slightly and then declined again. However, the sharp rise and fall were limited, and the difference between the front and back markets was not significant. The total difference was four taels and three qian. In retrospect, the decline was two taels and eight qian, a reaction to several days of consecutive gains. The market opened with a fall, but the exchange rate rose slightly, and news reported that there might be a proposal to reduce and repay outstanding debts. Therefore, people's minds seemed to be set on further gains. However, there was not much volume in the spot market, and the gold price hovered around 780 taels. Later, the market changed slightly, weakening and then leveling off. Subsequently, the December swap market opened slightly, with Rui Yu and Tong Feng Heng swapping in more than 100 bars, posting a price of two taels and three qian to two taels.

After that, Fu Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, and Rende Cheng came to buy in, and December US dollars closed at 75 again. Then, first let the first half month be convenient, and then the February price recovered, reaching eighty taels and a half at 3:30. Afterwards, the market reversed downstream. Only eight or nine qian rose. Qian Chang Xiang, Zhao  Chang, and Dalian helped sell, until it was seventy-eight taels and four qian at 4:00. Finally, US dollars seemed firm, with January made at 8.75, February at 92.75, and Shachi entering again in March. Some retailers were still buying, so the price gradually increased, reaching nine taels and three qian,  and then returned to eight taels and seven qian.

<h3>The Price of Li Taxes is Balanced, and Transactions are Particularly Smooth</h3>
<p>丨Copper Coins Suddenly Contract Again丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver dollar situation showed no significant changes in market prices. However, transactions and settlements were especially smooth and prosperous due to banks reopening on Monday. Given that the Lunar New Year is not far off, most funds cannot advance as boldly as during a period of development. Although things haven’t fully settled, new transactions are naturally not easy to undertake, ultimately leading to a lack of clarity in the situation and a softening of momentum, which is to be expected. Fortunately, overseas sales were quite smooth this time, which is good news amidst the bleakness.</p>
<p>〓Li Prices are Level in the Morning, High at Noon, and the Discount is Relatively Soft〓</p>
<p>The "foreign li" price in the early market was unchanged as buying and selling were vigorous in the morning, with equal strength on both sides. The price remained at 7 mace, 1 fen, 2 li, and 7 hao. In the afternoon market, banks bought more than they sold, and confidence strengthened, resulting in an increase of 2 hao and a half compared to the morning market, to 7 mace, 1 fen, 3 li. The "silver discount" decreased by another 2 fen compared to the previous day, calculated at 4 fen. There was no difference between the morning and afternoon markets. Although the "hua tou" (premium) initially opened at a white price, it closed at 3 or 4 fen.</p>
<p>〓Both Jiao Dollars Rise, Copper Coins Contract Sharply〓</p>
<p>The Jiangnan "small dollar" was 6 mace, 1 fen, and 7 li and a half in the morning market, 1 li and a half higher than the previous afternoon. The afternoon market saw few transactions, with little change. Transactions amounted to 5,500 jiao in the morning and 4,500 jiao in the afternoon. The Guangdong "small dollar" was 6 mace, 1 fen, and 4 li and a half in the morning market, and 6 mace, 1 fen, 5 li, and 7 hao in the afternoon, an increase of 1 li compared to the previous afternoon. Transactions amounted to 135,000 jiao in the morning and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins, which had shown a significant increase the previous day, contracted sharply by 6,000 cash yesterday, a further decrease of 1,000 cash compared to the end of last week, to 397,000 cash. Trading remained strong, with over 40,000 strings of cash.</p>
<p>〓Settlements are Frequent and Transactions are Flourishing〓</p>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and with the banks reopening, silver dollar transactions and settlements were naturally busy. Chinese merchants' settlement tickets totaled over 3.5 million, foreign merchants' settlement tickets totaled 3.12 million, advances totaled 1 million, special settlements totaled 2.78 million, and active settlements totaled over 5 million. Settlements for various goods, exchange rates, taxes, etc., totaled over 10 million. Issuance totaled 1.5 million, and silver pawn transactions totaled over 1.6 million. Silver public notes from money shops totaled over 37.7 million, "hua song" (transfer) settlements totaled over 5.1 million, various remittances totaled over 900,000, and cash receipts totaled over 1 million. For "foreign accounts," suspended tickets amounted to 1.08 million in the morning and 1.215 million in the afternoon. Banknotes were 85,000 in the morning and 50,000 in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 123,000 in the morning and 165,000 in the afternoon. Check transactions were 65,000 in the morning and 35,000 in the afternoon. Bank trading totaled 1.1 million in the morning and 950,000 in the afternoon. Interbank settlements of foreign currency accounts totaled over 1.9 million, banknote withdrawals and issues totaled 1.78 million, foreign currency pawn transactions totaled over 1.1 million, foreign currency public notes from money shops totaled over 10.3 million, "foreign premium" settlements totaled over 2.4 million, and foreign currency borrowing transactions totaled over 2.2 million. Transactions by small money shops totaled over 900,000.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Also Needs Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>According to news from the financial community yesterday, Wenzhou's market has always had limited silver dollar reserves. Because the market is small, it does not need a large amount of cash. This time, Liu Zhennian's troops have successively arrived in Wenzhou and are stationed there. The military pay is usually given in Shandong and Luyu bonds. However, the southern market has never used them. The provincial government has ordered the area to use them according to the market.</p>
<p>To build confidence, they have entrusted the financial community to set up collection points.</p>
<p>Therefore, they have telegraphed to the financial community in Shanghai to successively purchase silver dollars and send them to Wenzhou. Yesterday, the first batch of 150,000 was shipped out. Today, they will have to ship another 30,000 to 50,000 in sequence. In addition, yesterday's shipments included 200,000 to Guangzhou, 400,000 to various ports along the Yangtze River, 200,000 to Jinan, 300,000 to Shantou and Xiamen, and 100,000 to the interior. Altogether, including the amount shipped to Wenzhou, the total was 1.35 million. Furthermore, yesterday, various ports collected 200,000 to 300,000, but they were all odd lots, so there are no accurate statistics.</p>
<h3>The Price of Securities and Bonds Continues to Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>丨The January Futures are Almost Fully Opened丨</p>
<p>丨The Market is Closed Today for Settlement丨</p>
<p>Today, the 29th, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange will temporarily suspend trading due to the settlement of the November futures contracts. As for yesterday's market conditions, the turnover of spot goods remained sparse, but the January futures contracts for next year, although it was the first day of trading, were almost fully opened, except for Customs 96 and financial stocks. This situation has not been seen in recent years. Market prices have rebounded rapidly, and the enthusiasm of buyers and sellers shows no sign of waning. Not only is the turnover of December futures contracts quite large, but the newly opened January contracts are also very active, not like the usual wait-and-see attitude during settlement periods. The changes in the price of various bonds continue to show a very good situation. Market sentiment is very good, and everyone is inclined to buy, which has led to unusually enthusiastic buying. As a result, various prices have continued to rise sharply. In the two morning sessions, there were no major changes compared to the end of last week, but in the afternoon market, prices rose sharply, more than one yuan higher than the morning. As a result, 20 Customs bonds rose by 1.5 yuan, and consolidated salt tax 20 bonds rose by over 1 yuan each, while the whole 6 bonds rose sharply by 2.2 yuan, and others also rose by 6 or 7 jiao each. Total spot trading for the day amounted to 28,000 yuan, and futures trading amounted to 7.7 million yuan, of which new January trading accounted for over 1.1 million yuan.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Mixed</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that on Saturday (the 26th) the New York stock market first rose due to progress in railway freight. Then, speculators took advantage of the high prices to sell, so the price recovered to fatigue, and the result was no significant change from the previous day. Half-day turnover totaled 376,000 shares. Also, Railway Magazine reported that freight cars increased by 77,652 within a week, a new record for the year. The stock market this week was almost entirely dominated by the war debt issue. Although the selling pressure was evident on Wednesday, turnover was not large. Because the shares are partly in the hands of the public, otherwise the market would have collapsed long ago. It is expected that war debt will remain the central force before December 15. However, Congress will convene soon. If the budget bill has good results, the bad international situation can be offset. Otherwise, the market trend may break through the low of October 11. The closing prices of the Dow Jones Indexes on the 26th are listed below:</p>
<p>| Index | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 30 Industrial Stocks | 58.89 | Up 0.2 |</p>
<p>| 20 Railroad Stocks | 26.47 | Down 0.08 |</p>
<p>| 20 Utility Stocks | 27.00 | Up 0.10 |</p>
<p>| 40 Bonds | 77.71 | Down 0.05 |</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Enters a Slump</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is trending downwards, and the situation is extremely bleak. Actual sales are too sluggish, and the financial depletion in the interior is unimaginable. In addition, inferior yarns are being dumped at reduced prices in all directions, further affecting local yarns. As a result, business has been cut off, and the backlog of each factory is increasing day by day. The future situation is grim. The Shenxin Factory sees the unfavorable environment and opens sales from time to time. Buyers are hedging their bets in the futures market.</p>
<h3>The Human Mark Market is Pessimistic</h3>
<p>The opening of the human mark market was declining due to American trends. Sentiment remained at a decline of 3 to 4 mace for each month. It was reported that there were still few transactions in the afternoon, and each month fell by another 1, 2, and 5 mace. Total market turnover was estimated at 15,000 bales. It was found that Dafu sold 600 bales, Jifeng sold 850 bales, Jianyu sold 700 bales, Yicheng sold 700 bales, and Yichang sold 450 bales. Changyu bought 400 bales, Feifa bought 900 bales, Renfeng bought 750 bales, and Qunchang bought 750 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Human Mark | Closing Price | Increase/Decrease | Open Account |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 314 | Down 856,200 |  |</p>

<h3>Actual Demand Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>The liquidation of cash remains sluggish. It was found that various gangs bought a total of 402 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by 2.5 to 2.75 mace. Shenxin Factory opened sales of 2,500 bales of 20-count labeled cotton yarn for 149 taels, for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th month futures periods. The amounts purchased by each gang are listed below:</p>
<p>Xiamen 15, Interior 156, Qunnan 12, Fellow Traders 20, Changsha 10, Ningbo 56, Shantou 5, Guangdong 15, Guangzhou 40, Jiangxi 5</p>
<h3>Cotton Market is Gradually Softening</h3>
<p>The cotton market is gradually showing signs of weakening. Because American cotton is completely lifeless, and yarn and cloth are falling, spot sales are stagnant. The price of cotton in Hankou is said to be falling. Thus, the situation is turning tired, and the decline is slightly intense. However, the supply from various sources is still lacking. The future situation is difficult to grasp.</p>
<h3>This Month's Cotton Down 4.5 Mace</h3>
<p>The Zheng mark market opened weaker in the morning, as American cotton fell again. Market conditions in the market were slightly sluggish, with each month falling by 5 fen to 1 qian. The market situation remained soft in the afternoon, with each month falling another 1 qian to 2 qian. Total turnover for the day was estimated at 37,600 piculs. It was found that Delong sold 3,000 piculs, Luchang sold 1,400 piculs, Rongxing sold 1,700 piculs, and Tonghe sold 1,000 piculs. Jifeng bought 1,200 piculs, Senkang bought 900 piculs, and Changhe bought 1,700 piculs. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Zheng Mark | Closing Price | Up/Down | Open Account |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| 321 | Down 196,800 |  |</p>
<p>| December 3100 | 45160,800 |  |</p>

<p>| Total 754,000 |  |  |</p>
<p>| February 3145 | 20135300 |  |</p>
<h3>Little Improvement in Cotton Demand</h3>
<p>Spot cotton business is still flat. The source is estimated to be 536 bales of Yao cotton and 2,676 bales of general cotton.</p>
<p>31.50 Taels Tongzhou Cotton Thread Tong Factory receives 800 bales of spot goods into the factory</p>
<p>Also 31.50 Yongyu receives 200 bales into the factory Also Also</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 31.Shanghai Factory receives 200 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>Also 30.50 Also Another Production Also Also</p>
<p>Also 30.75 Hengda Factory receives 10 pieces Also Also</p>
<p>Also 30.25 Shenxin Factory receives 200 pieces Also Stack Delivery</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market is Slightly Stable</h3>
<p>(South) Yesterday, more than fifty merchants came from various regions. Trading in the area was more active than usual. Northern accounts were slightly above stack, close to a thousand piculs. Prices rose slightly. Early and late, sales followed arrivals, and the situation stabilized. Arriving goods were weak, and prices were tired.</p>
<p>(News) Approximately thirty-seven or eight rice boats arrived. Local defense sales were brisk. Rice fell 2 jiao. Rice merchants from Changshu and Jiangyin were slightly active, and prices stabilized. Goods at the pier were neither glorious nor disgraced.</p>
<h3>Customer Xiang Rice Sales Strong and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>丨Geng Yang Gang is Extremely Poor丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xiang rice market was stagnant in the north and booming in the south. Arrivals continued to come at a price, which was due to the Nangyang gang's extremely keen taste for millet. The Erzhou and Quanzhou areas were the first to inquire. Recently, because foreign rice is not economical, the intention to deal is stronger. Yesterday, in addition to Quanzhou and Fuzhou, the Shantou and Xiamen gangs followed up and competed for sales, and prices jumped up by five or six cents, close to the jiao. Based on the strong appetite of the Nantou gang, the market should rise in steps. However, because there are large amounts of foreign rice in storage in the market and many new arrivals of customer Xiang rice, Hunan rice can be continuously shipped to Shanghai after the production price is aligned. Jiangxi rice is also aligned recently, so there is no need to worry about shortages. Because the source is not interrupted, the market price will not see a sharp increase. Sales follow arrivals, and there is no large-scale accumulation in the market. Yesterday, Tongshi opened sales of 1,000 bags of Hunan machine oil at prices of 8 yuan 8 jiao 7 fen and 8 yuan 7 jiao 24 fen, down to 8 yuan 6 jiao. Also, 650 bags of machine red rice were priced at 8 yuan 5 fen to 7 yuan 9 jiao. Also, 100 bags of red crude were priced at 6 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen. Also, 550 bags of Jingshan were priced at 7 yuan 2 jiao 7 fen to 7 yuan 2 jiao. 800 bags of Jiangxi machine late were priced at 8 yuan 9 jiao to 8 yuan 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Future Wheat is Cleverly Housed</h3>
<p>丨Only Seven Cars of Wheat Delivered This Month丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the future wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, generally showed a firm trend for each month. Foreign wheat was good, and the sale of spot foreign wheat has also recently been quiet. (However, there are rumors that Australian wheat is sold out of warehouses for 3 taels, 3 qian, and 8 fen, but the authenticity is unknown.) In addition, futures trading has been firmly suppressed by large factories, and the steps are rising. The source of wheat has also been limited recently, so sentiment has been brought up. As a result, January was 4 fen better than the previous day, February had no comparison, March was 4 fen better, and April was 3 fen. The number of deliveries this month was limited, totaling only 7 cars, delivered by Yuanyu Dingmai, etc., and received by Yuanhechang, said to have been handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Near Firm and Far Even Flour Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed a trend of near firm and far even for each month. The price of foreign wheat rebounded by one jiao, and manufacturers, especially small and medium-sized factories, had a prospect. Those who have entered the factory are now reluctant to sell because the spot goods are still tight, so the situation this month is still firm and clever. Luo Gao is at 1 tael, 8 qian, and 6 fen. December and January also showed gains. Early in the long-term months, it was also firm, but by the afternoon, sentiment softened again due to some selling by Fu. Looking at the recent trend, because the gold market is more expensive and the exchange rate is shortening, the general public believes that foreign wheat orders will be hit. However, if foreign products are still surplus, I am afraid no one will care. As a result, the months from this month to January rose by 1 fen, February and March rose by 2 li, and April rose by 5 li.</p>
<h3>Chicago Wheat Reverses Upward</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reports that on Saturday the 26th, Chicago wheat, due to poor winter tillage reports and short covering, rose by 0.375 to 0.5 cents for each period. Also, on the 25th, the number of transactions totaled 30 million bushels. The list of the 26th line is on the left,</p>
<p>| Closing Price | Change from Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| December Period 43.25 | Up 0.0 |</p>
<p>| May Period 45.625 | Up 0.375 |</p>
<p>| July Period 48.625 | Up 0.375 |</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea District Continues to Ship to Shanghai</h3>
<p>丨240 Pieces Arrived by Small Steamer Yesterday丨</p>
<p>The sales route of the Ji Li District to Europe and America has been difficult to smooth for a long time, and since the new silk has been listed in the producing area, each silk firm has handed over the new silk to the factory, the old swing became jing, the silk in storage has increased sharply, and the canal is quite lively. Yesterday (Nanxun) (Huhu) two ports, there were 240 pieces of Qianjing, which were transported to Shanghai by small steamer and stored in stacks for sale.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Market Turns Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in this port turned quiet. The most important Luju Zhenmei sales route was quite sluggish. Tu tea and Pearl tea had scattered transactions. The market has been in a depressed mood. The Contribution Tea was reopened by the Russian Assistance Association's foreign firm yesterday. However, the amount of entering the stomach is not very recognized, and the price is still low. General tea merchants are still pessimistic about the future of the tea market.</p>
<h3>More Than 5,000 Loads of New Metal Goods Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>(A Glimpse of the Market)</p>
<p>Yesterday's metal market was mixed. Overseas sales were more smooth than before, so more than 2,000 loads were transacted. Buyers were mostly Qing, 烴, Han and other gangs, and the Guangzhou and inland river routes were previously cold. This kind of business such as Liang, Bang, Tea Gang, etc., has stopped, and those who have changed to the market are only practical factories and death, so the surface of the market is difficult to be satisfactory, but the inside is very dry.</p>
<p>(New Goods Loaded)</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dagu, Gonghe and Xiang stack all had new metal goods loaded, totaling 5,600 to 700 loads, including new foreign Yuan Yuan, Yuan steel, angle iron, tinplate, etc., mostly British, 　boards, Xinlu leather white lead skin, etc. Still no loading, so the market is still inevitable, there is a shortage of goods worry.</p>
<p>(Price Changes)</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation of various metal goods, there are more rises and fewer falls. The reason is that the market goods are shallow. Tinplate, white lead skin, steel plate, bamboo festival, white iron tile, etc., all have a tendency to rise, and the most violent increase is especially Tui belonging to mouth iron as a unique step check its number of improvement, then more than one or two two trading aspects, but still not because of the high goods and reduce their purchase also the English goods is estimated at eleven two five hundred yuan, I heard that the transaction yesterday, there are seven or eight hundred boxes, but the market goods is very small, the back market is still look up, as for the falling trend, the recent market can be said to be very few, in addition to flowers and trees lead wire green iron wire cloth and other unpopular colors, other special rare in the market.</p>
<p>(General Bookings)</p>
<p>The city has been suffering from the weakness of the bottom goods for days, and the general buyers often have the worry of connecting the blue and yellow, so they have ordered the bank to buy fixed-term goods, I heard that the book made yesterday is also a lot, including tinplate English steel plate Xinlu skin lead and other seven or eight kinds of white iron and other seven or eight kinds.</p>
<h3>Pile Head is Extremely Good</h3>
<p>The thick goods are like the felt flannel, overcoat flannel, Melton, thick flat flannel, riding breeches flannel, and the yellow camel hair, etc. The street's various help sales fields are very prosperous. The western style clothing and overcoat making fields, and the door village shop and other people have a considerable amount of Huaiwei and Tongyi will continue to have open sales in the morning and afternoon, and the sales disk is quite stable, especially the true brown sleeve lili and riding breeches the second trend is more lively.</p>

<h3>Textual Research on Wu Proverbs</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The grammar of Wu proverbs has no specialized book, only in tacit understanding. In describing time, Wu proverbs sometimes use "tou li" (頭裏) and sometimes "tou shang" (頭上). 丨Shang is pronounced as Lang, same below.</p>
<p>Suddenly is called "zha sheng tou li" (乍生頭裏), in a dream is called "kun meng tou li" (困夢頭裏), in disappointment is called "dao mei tou li" (倒霉頭裏), in busyness is called "jia mang tou li" (夾忙頭裏); all sudden or unfortunate events are applicable to these two words "tou li."</p>
<p>In important times it is called "yao jin tou shang" (要緊頭上), when fortune arrives it is called "yun qi tou shang" (運氣頭上), when delicious it is called "hao chi tou shang" (好吃頭上), at a crucial moment it is called "guan zi tou shang" (關子頭上); all important or fortunate events are applicable to these two words "tou shang."</p>
<p>The people of Suzhou are glib, and many of the transmitted proverbs have been misinterpreted; I have corrected their errors from the aspect of "a change of one sound," and I very much want to write a correction of Wu proverbs to correct the dialects of my hometown. Now I will write a few items behind:</p>
<p>It is commonly said that there is no hope, called "yao chang meng dong" (杳長懞懂); it should be corrected to "ye chang meng duo" (夜長夢多, long night, many dreams). It is commonly said that things are entangled, called "ya ge luan jing" (丫割亂經), it should be corrected to "wo ge nong jing" (握葛弄荆, holding kudzu and playing with thorns). It is commonly said that misunderstandings occur, called "chuan zui jia zhong" (傳嘴夾中), it should be corrected to "chan zhi jiao niu" (纏枝絞紐, entangled branches and twisted knots). It is commonly said to wear clothes loosely, called "san pao san jia" (散抛散夾), it should be corrected to "san pao san jia" (散袍散甲, scattered robes and armor). It is commonly said to waste things, called "ang zang ma yi" (骯髒螞蟻, dirty ants); 丨Yi is pronounced as Mi. It should be corrected to "ang zang mo mie" (骯髒磨滅, dirty attrition).</p>
<p>In slang, people like to use the three characters "ba zhi jiao" (八隻脚, eight feet). Too far away is called "dang kong ba zhi jiao" (蕩空八隻脚, empty space eight feet), too many people and hands are called "qi shou ba zhi jiao" (七手八隻脚, seven hands eight feet), too many branches are called "ya cha ba zhi jiao" (丫叉八隻脚, forked eight feet); 丨Yi is pronounced as Qiang. Disorderly is called "shi chai ba zhi jiao" (拾柴八隻脚, pick firewood eight feet); 丨Shi is pronounced as Xi.</p>
<p>The origin of "shi chai ba zhi jiao" (拾柴八隻脚) comes from the four characters "shi chai po zhou" (拾柴潑粥, pick firewood and spill porridge), which have been misinterpreted through transmission; just because the speech is glib, "shi chai po zhou" (拾柴潑粥) is read as "shi chai ba zu" (拾柴八足, pick firewood eight feet), and the pronunciation of the characters has already been misinterpreted; unexpectedly, one mistake leads to another, and the two characters "ba zu" (八足, eight feet) are misinterpreted as "ba zhi jiao" (八隻脚, eight feet). Therefore, in Wu proverbs, there is this five-character noun "shi chai ba zhi jiao" (拾柴八隻脚).</p>
<h3>Contradictory Facts</h3>
<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>Under the sign of "Winter Sale," old, young, male, and female, like a tide, crowded the various departments of the Three Companies and the big department stores; silver and banknotes flowed continuously into the copper counters, and big and small packages were continuously tucked under the armpits of those old and young, male and female customers. Crowded together, where can one still find the phenomenon of "business slump" in the Shanghai market after three or four in the afternoon?</p>
<p>On the road where the red and green iridescent lights shone, the beauty cars adorned with carbide lamps, the cool night was like water, and the wind penetrated the skin at midnight, shuttled back and forth on the road. The small electric lights, like the twinkling stars in the sky, were just as lively and prosperous. This scene of prosperity is truly gilded and intoxicating. Who can still say that China is not peaceful!</p>
<p>"The heart of patriotism, dare not lag behind others." "Economic severance, persevere to the end." Shanghai, which is full of patriotic merchants, has recently had 300,000 inferior goods selling well in the Shanghai market. "The world is bustling, all for profit; the world is bustling, all for profit." No wonder the bombs of the blood soul group cannot revive the conscience of that group of patriotic merchants! The afterglow of the "Kalachakra Mandala Ceremony" has just subsided, and the XX Department is promoting the national quintessence of dragon boat racing again. No wonder the "high pavilion" of Sanbei has received a notice from the provincial government for protection; the "Yansheng Association" in Wuxi has caused a sensation among tens of thousands of people. This is one time, that is another time. The gears of the times are constantly cycling forward. Who knows that during this period of national crisis, the old immortals on the top of Kunyu Mountain will not descend gracefully and ask the heavenly soldiers and generals to kill all the foreign invaders for the Republic of China.</p>
<p>There are too many contradictory things, which is how the Republic of China is organized into a national crisis, but the Heng dance and the drunken song remain.</p>
<h3>Central Idea of Movies and Dramas</h3>
<p>— Xiuqing</p>
<p>丨Need Revolutionary Stimulation丨</p>
<p>The narration of love stories. In the current diverse movies and dramas, it has almost become the only central drama material. No matter whether it is a domestic or foreign film, sound or silent, almost seven or eight out of ten jump out of this circle. Mei Lanfang arrived in Shanghai today. Mr. Mei has been invited by all circles to come south, but he declined and failed to get it. He may perform voluntarily for a few days. According to a special telegram from Beiping, Mr. Mei has already gone south by Yongche and is scheduled to arrive at the North Station at 5:30 p.m. , and everything has been taken care of by Mr. Huang Jinrong, and we will go to meet him.</p>
<p>For example, "Human Beast Wonders" is just a news-oriented beast film. But the insertion of the explorer's love story is still an indispensable material.</p>
<p>Originally, drama is the performance of life. Love is also the most interesting and meaningful section in the life process. Of course, this is the only good drama material for making movies. However, in every film. There is no correct and noble central idea, specializing in catering to the audience's low-level psychology by favoring romantic, amorous and sensual performances. This is a very common disease in current Chinese and Western films. At the same time, it can also be said to be a sign of the decline of the film industry.</p>
<p>Especially during the national crisis, under the creed of "entertainment does not forget to save the country." What the public urgently needs is definitely not the anesthetizing films of individual hedonism; but a type of work with a revolutionary patriotic thought.</p>
<p>However, domestic films of this type are really rare and very few in number. Here, we cannot but praise the recent sound film "Flower of Freedom" written and directed by Mr. Zheng Zhengqiu of the Star Film Company. The plot of this film is about General Cai Songpo overthrowing the monarchy and recreating the revolutionary story of the Republic. Endless patriotic blood and tears are reflected on the screen. The great spirit of fighting for freedom is depicted in the film, which is very stimulating. The profound performance of the protagonist, Ms. Hu Die, makes the emotions feel more real and moving. Indeed, this is a film and drama that is needed by the times and is different from the current trend.</p>
<h3>Occasional Notes on Reading Paintings</h3>
<p>— Deng Qingcheng</p>
<p>In the spring of the year before last in my county, I initiated the Yunxi Painting and Calligraphy Association, which brought together more than 500 pieces of works by painters and calligraphers in the county. It was exhibited in the first public garden for ten days, and it was very grand at the time. Afterwards, there was no shortage of people who continued, but there were many landscapes, figures, and freehand flowers and birds, each with its own characteristics and different schools of painting. However, if you want to be like Mr. Zhao Anzhi who has devoted himself to it for more than 20 years, from the Song and Yuan Dynasties to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, he has copied all the masters to the fullest extent and achieved the ultimate, which is very worthwhile to watch. Mr. Zhao, although a native of the county, has been away for a long time. He is proficient in landscapes, figures, and feather and animal painting. In the past, he participated in the National Art Exhibition and the Belgian Ryan Chess International Exposition, and both won high praise and won gold awards, so he has long been famous at home and abroad. This month, when he returned to his hometown, he first displayed his large and small masterpieces in the park. I was able to participate in the grand event, and I deeply admire his hard work, which is difficult and valuable. There are many inscriptions by famous people, such as Mr. Kuang Zhoufeng's inscription on the Painting of Heavenly Maid Scattering Flowers, adjusted to the tune of Qing Buluo: In the country of many fragrances, is the heavenly maid or not? But it was Qingniao who made the messenger, saying that it was Fairy E'e. I pity Duo Bing Xiuwen, Vimalakirti's previous life, drawing the truth and calling him to wake up, and he will start to make spring. Mr. Chu Minyi inscribed a flower and bird album saying: Lifelike. Mr. Wang Yiting inscribed: The fragrance of flowers and the language of birds adorn the spring breeze, and the wonderful brush imitates nature, the light green and deep red are beautiful in spring, and it is beyond the image to get in the middle. Mr. Zhu Xibai inscribed plum blossoms: The spring letter from Gushan arrives at the southern branches, and the snow is more gorgeous than peach and plum blossoms. Mr. He Jing should smile, and his old wife still likes to fight Yan Zhi. I also inscribed a quatrain on the lotus I wrote: A famous flower that can overwhelm the country cannot withstand autumn, this flower is like a brocade, and its nature is secluded. Don't dislike that there are no good works in the late evening, but it occupies the first place in the cold river. Others such as Qian Mingshan's inscription on the postscript of peach blossom hydrangea, and Wu Jingyu's inscription on daffodils and bluebirds, are all extremely clear and exquisite. Even Anzhi's own inscription on the painting is also full of beautiful sentences. On the third day of the exhibition, the viewers gathered, all thinking that the painting style has been greatly revived. Compared with those who make current paintings with a free brush, it cannot be compared.</p>
<h3>The Crossroads of Death</h3>
<p>— Fan Yanqiao (2)(10)(8)</p>
<p>Such an Ending</p>
<p>From room number 436 of the Southeast Hotel, a perfect couple walked out, the woman like a blossoming flower, clinging to the man's arm. The man constantly twitched his little mustache, laughing with unrestrained pride. At the elevator entrance, they switched directions, standing opposite each other. The man was about to brush aside a strand of hair on the woman's forehead, but she turned her head and twisted the ends of her hair into a small circle herself, then turned back to ask, "How is it?" The man nodded and said, "Good!" The woman said again, "These few strands of hair never seem to hold a curl, almost curling them every day, but they still hang straight down."</p>
<p>The elevator arrived, taking them both to the sixth floor. The rooms on the sixth floor were larger and more elaborately furnished. Room number 666 was the most opulent, and they walked into this one. The bellboy recognized Aili and smiled knowingly, not asking any questions. Whether it was tea or cigarettes, he knew to bring them. As soon as he slammed the door shut, the man eagerly asked, "Aili, have you promised me?" Aili, still facing the mirror, fiddled with the hair circles on her forehead and said softly, "Why so impatient? Marriage is a lifelong commitment, one must consider it carefully, right?" "Muliang! I want to ask you, you like women so much, is there only a female dog guarding your house? I don't believe it!" "I can swear on that, if I have a concubine at home, I'll..." Aili hurriedly rushed over, covering his mouth with her hand, saying, "Don't say it! I believe you." She seized the opportunity to sit on his lap, lowering her head to look at the whorls on her fingers. Muliang brought his little mustache closer, closer to her cheek, and stopped. Aili pushed him away, stood up, and sat down in the rocking chair opposite, saying with a tremble in her voice, "Suppose, a country girl, a big, snowy bun of hair, two large sleeves swaying back and forth, would you be willing to kiss her?"</p>
<p>Muliang chuckled and said, "How could you imagine such a thing? Seeing her would make me want to throw up my dinner from the night before, how could I have the appetite to kiss her?"</p>
<p>"So you like modern tricks, can even speak foreign languages, then you'll despise me, won't you?" Muliang quickly defended, "No! Never! In short, you have already satisfied my desires." "Suppose, the current me, returns to my original appearance, you wouldn't want me then, would you?"</p>
<p>"What is your original appearance like?"</p>
<p>"A country girl!"</p>
<p>"Hmm!... In short, right now I only love you, you can change, change, change, even into a yaksha, and I would still love you."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Really!"</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Selling Old Age</h3>
<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>In recent days, the newspapers have been carrying huge advertisements, claiming that a "long-bearded Daoist of one hundred and nine years who once ate a giant peach" is "cultivating longevity connections" within X World, "available for anyone to see, no admission fee." Those who cherish the three blessings [longevity, wealth, and health] will surely flock to him, seeking instructions from this "quasi-immortal" on the secrets of longevity, or perhaps even taking him as a master, in order to ascend to the realm of immortality together. This is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity.</p>
<p>Originally, this world is pitifully small and strangely incomplete. A lifespan of just a few decades cannot satisfy human desires. But to seek longevity, one must enter the mountains and "cultivate the Dao for sixty years," which is an unaccustomed loneliness. The mountains are not like the mountains of Tangshan or Moganshan, where one can ride in a car and eat good food. This is what modern people are unwilling to do. Seeking longevity for the sake of "enjoying pleasure," yet wanting to "suffer" first in order to achieve longevity, this business seems too uneconomical. Therefore, the comedy of entering the mountains to cultivate the Dao is only undertaken by a few "without a path to life" or fools. Dignified gentlemen would never fall for that. Now it's good, the immortal doesn't abandon the mortal world, descends to the foreign concessions, and for a small fee of two cents, one can obtain the secret of longevity, truly the cheapest and most beautiful thing. Moreover, it's much more useful than life insurance that makes the descendants rich after death. Presumably, "white teeth" can be "reborn," and youthful beauty will naturally not be difficult to maintain. From then on, people will be "floating," and everyone will have "three-foot-long beards," with old men all over the streets. This would become like the "Nation of Wisdom" in "Flowers in the Mirror," what a grand event! By that time, "eightieth birthday celebrations" would become a joke, and even "thousand-elder banquets" would be insignificant.</p>
<p>But I also think that the meaning of life does not lie in the length of life, but in how much responsibility one bears for the advancement of the times and society. If one only seeks to be "old and not die," that's a "quirk," and there's really not much meaning to it. Therefore, Wang Yi died for his country, and though his life was short, it was like heaven's lifespan, while Peng Zu lived to eight hundred, and though his life was long, it was like a day. Boasting about lifespan to the earth is really pitifully short. The cicada does not know spring and autumn, yet the great transformation of the universe remains a mystery to mankind to this day. Therefore, there is no need to ask for directions, just walk step by step. To put it another way, even if a person lives to be a hundred or a thousand years old, besides being charmingly senile and available for people to admire, what else is the use? What is the difference between this and the "ancient treasures" in the Palace Museum? In terms of intrinsic value, they are probably not as worthy as Zhou tripods and Yin basins that can be sold.</p>
<p>China is essentially a youthful country. Most of the administrators are young, handsome, learned, and capable, rarely are they elderly and senile. Although some have long beards, they have never reached three feet, and the general mentality is that when one is not yet seventy, one should retire to the forests and springs, spending one's remaining years in leisure. Taking on great difficulties is a matter for the younger generation. Like the German President Paul von Hindenburg, who at the age of eighty-five still held the power of the entire country, handling ten thousand things a day, not knowing to retire and enjoy a few years of peace in his hometown, he is truly the world's biggest fool.</p>
<p>Alas, Eastern and Western cultures are ultimately separated by an ocean.</p>

<h3>Bitter Battle</h3>

<p>The piercingly cold yin wind rises from ancient tombs, ten thousand brave soldiers have no way back. The general's commands are stern and clear, no need to count the corpses strewn across the fields.</p>
<p>................................................................</p>
<p>The torrential night rain breaks dry trees. Commanded to sneak into the camp, they must cross in the dark. A thunderclap suddenly announces the sound of killing the enemy. The entire army is half-overwhelmed, enraging the central command.</p>

<p>The chilling frost freezes birds to death. The sandy battlefield is stained with blood from vicious attacks. Poisonous smoke and fierce bombs fill the sky. Flesh and blood clash horribly on the edge of blades.</p>

<h3>A New Method for Measuring Tone Fork Vibration Frequencies</h3>
<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>Acoustics scholars all know what a tuning fork is, and they all know its importance. The point of its importance is because its tone resembles the club that produces the original sound; the harmonic overtones it produces are few. Therefore, those measuring the vibration frequencies of various musical instruments often use tuning forks as the standard. Thus, the need for accuracy in tuning fork vibration frequency is beyond saying. But common methods for measuring tuning fork vibration frequency are nothing more than the following:</p>
<p>(1) Selecting various tuning forks of known vibration frequency and vibrating them simultaneously with a certain fork; when it is measured that the pitches of the sounds are the same, the known vibration frequency is the vibration frequency of that certain tuning fork. (2) Using a siren and vibrating it alongside a fork, adjusting its speed so that it is consistent with the pitch of the fork; the vibration frequency of the certain fork is inferred from the rotational speed and the number of holes on the plate.</p>
<p>(3) Coating a cylinder or glass plate with lampblack or white powder, attaching a very thin needle to the end of the fork, making the needle tip lightly contact the cylinder or plate, and after striking the fork to vibrate it, rotating the cylinder or moving the plate at a uniform speed, the number of waves drawn by the fork can be measured within a certain time, and its vibration frequency can also be inferred.</p>
<p>Although the above three methods use both ears and eyes, they tend to rely more on the ears. The newest measuring method, however, emphasizes the use of eyes and uses ears as an aid, and its theory is more meticulous; therefore, I specifically</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>wrote it out, to enrich reference materials for colleagues.</p>
<p>(1) Take the tuning fork whose vibration frequency is to be measured and vibrate it at the same time as a string; and look at the vibration state of the string through the gaps between the prongs of the fork. If the two vibration frequencies are indeed equal, then the back-and-forth vibration of the string will present a kind of roundabout and slow phenomenon, which can be seen from the side. If the two are slightly mismatched, there will be no such situation at all. Readjust the length and tension of the string, so that this phenomenon is very obvious, and then use the string vibration frequency formula to calculate the vibration frequency of the string, which is the vibration frequency of the tuning fork.</p>
<p>(2) Connect the siren plate to a rotator and rotate it at a uniform speed, and place the tuning fork in front of the plate, allowing a portion of the plate to be seen through the gaps between the fork prongs; if the vibration frequencies of the sounds emitted by the two are indeed equal, then the round holes on the plate will appear to be stationary and not rotating; if there is a slight difference, then the round holes will seem to slowly move either backwards or forwards, and the speed of their movement will differ depending on the difference between the two vibration frequencies. Therefore, know that if you adjust the siren to produce the above phenomenon, and then use the siren calculation method to find its vibration frequency, you will get the vibration frequency of the tuning fork.</p>
<p>(3) Take the tuning fork whose vibration frequency is to be measured and a tuning fork of known vibration frequency, making their prongs directly parallel to each other...place a candle flame behind the second tuning fork. Strike the two forks to make them sound, and observe the flame with one eye from the gap between the two forks...If the two vibration frequencies are indeed equal, then the flame will appear and disappear at certain intervals and in a regular rhythm; if there is a slight difference, then the appearance and disappearance of the light will not be in sync; it may even be confused and invisible. Therefore, test with various forks until a regular phenomenon occurs. Then the vibration frequency of the known fork is the vibration frequency of the unknown fork.</p>
<p>The above three new methods can correct the errors of hearing with eyesight; because hearing often fails to discern subtle differences, scholars must use multiple methods for testing, referencing and comparing, in order to obtain accurate results!</p>

<p>Excitedly walking into the classroom, a blackboard eraser suddenly fell and hit my head with a "thump," making sparks fly from the top of my head. Just as I was about to explode, the students inside shouted, "Today's amusement meeting has no admission fee, and a blackboard eraser is included!" So I calmed down, knowing that this class was ruled by the barber's assistant, and there would definitely be some very fresh tricks to be discovered. Sure enough, after settling down and looking up, the blackboard was already filled with the program, which included:</p>
<p>Little Long-legs Violin Solo</p>
<p>Tailor's Assistant Gongche Tune</p>
<p>Bull Tricks and Horse Show</p>
<p>Ms. XXX Sings Lullaby</p>
<p>Young Mistress Hypnotic Song</p>
<p>Three "Tang" Joint Trial</p>
<p>Mr. XXX Humming Tune</p>
<p>Mass March</p>
<p>................................................................</p>
<p>Good, with so many good programs and good music to listen to for an hour, probably no one will doze off. So after the teacher took attendance, Little Long-legs' ghostly and lingering mouth-skill violin, followed by the tailor's assistant's strange Gongche tune, took the stage. With the accompaniment of music, the teacher spoke with even more color. The students in the hall were filled with a spring breeze, and the barber's assistant worked without hearing it.</p>
<p>When the yellow bull and the old horse began to move, they knocked over a desk. Because of their failure, they declared, "We are unable to offer our poor performance today, please teach us tomorrow, please forgive us." After saying that, the masculine lady XXX blew her reed and performed a lullaby. Little Tang, with two eyes staring, couldn't help but conduct some "oiling." "Ai!" Little Tang had to withdraw his hand, smiling at everyone around him.</p>
<p>Originally, the next program was the young mistress's hypnotic song. However, the young mistress avoided the scene at the last minute. The young mistress's black lacquer stool, Gu Lao, (Gu should be written as orphan) then said to the crowd, "She is indisposed today, please forgive her..."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Little Tang in the Three "Tang" Joint Trial, because he had just wanted to oil but was shouted back by everyone, deliberately took the stage to make trouble, causing the small head with a Pingju addiction in the training ground to be quite disappointed.</p>
<p>Mr. XXX was very generous, and the humming tune was finally hummed out. This so-called Mr. is not a real Mr., but because he has the style of a Mr., he is called that. He sang the humming tune very well, and congratulatory telegrams flew in like snowflakes. He untied his cravat triumphantly.</p>
<p>The teacher held fast to the principle of "sing if you want, but I still teach," only speaking eloquently, and pretending not to hear even if he did.</p>
<p>March of the Grandees, boom boom... boom boom boom```, the entire classroom singing loudly startled the teacher. So he gave a lecture to the students in Mandarin, but the program had already been performed in order, and the merits were also said to be complete. The students laughed out loud and squeezed out like a tide with the dismissal bell.</p>
<h3>A Letter</h3>
<p>— Cai Xuan</p>
<p>My Ling:</p>
<p>Like a wisp of spider silk in mid-air, you have once again drifted alone to distant Guangzhou. As your wife, your Chan should have given you deep comfort and sympathy for your wandering, but your Chan has not done so, and not only has she not felt lonely because of your departure, but she has also learned to be much quieter!</p>
<p>My Ling! There is no need for you to resent or grieve after reading these few sentences, because undeniably, we are no longer as passionately in love as we were during our courtship; we are growing more and more distant and estranged!</p>
<p>Since we had our lovely and pitiful Ying'er, for various reasons, it marked the beginning of our estrangement and alienation. This estrangement and alienation gradually grew, and your Chan gradually lost her usual love for you, and even became a little disgusted with you! Because of this, I often remain silent, treasure my smile, sadly show my unhappy face, don't talk to you happily, and often curse you for a little trivial matter for no reason, and finally sob and cry to you! As for you? Ah, pitiful Ling, you seem to be deeply depressed after seeing my abnormal attitude towards you, but you did not comfort and inquire me with tenderness as you did in the past when I was angry, you just remained silent, which proves that you are also harboring a hatred of me! Especially when we sleep silently in bed, I always sternly refuse your physiological demands on me, which further increases your anger, and you often vent the anger that cannot be vented on our beloved Ying'er, who is pitiful, lonely, and cold. Thus, in such a situation, there is no joy, no laughter, everything presents the gloomy atmosphere of autumn, and the family that we once recognized as happy has become a painful family!</p>
<p>Dear Ling, I feel very painful and very sad that our relationship has broken down! Therefore, I often shed my tears and sadly recall the sweetness and perfection of our past life, and now, alas, it is truly unbearable to look back, unbearable to look back!</p>
<p>I still remember deeply when I was in the maiden days of my flowery youth, a kind of natural, hot, youthful vitality made me unable to control myself and I longed for a handsome lover. Later, I finally met you, I felt happy, and at that time I truly loved you deeply! Soon, after much difficulty, we were able to struggle out from under the iron heel of our old family and get married. However, after living such a happy life for less than a year, we both felt somewhat ordinary; however, at that time we still hoped that a lovely child would regulate our ordinary and lonely life; but I was disappointed, after I gave birth to Ying'er, the child's crying, the complexity of household affairs,...all of this made me gradually feel disgusted from ordinary! At the same time, I gradually felt that you were not as lovely as before! Everything about you would arouse my dissatisfaction and disgust. Therefore, we became estranged, alienated, creating this irreparable and unfortunate situation.</p>
<p>Now what? For the sake of life, you have once again drifted alone to distant Guangzhou. Although I have not given you comfort and sympathy, in my heart I still love you on the emotional basis of our several years of marriage! We are still young, and there are many more years of cohabitation to come. I hope that we can all try our best to rekindle the dead ashes of love, and not continue this ominous situation. Yes, my Ling, I love you, I still deeply love you; you also understand me, you also deeply love me, right!</p>
<p>Ying'er has become more interesting, clever, and lively recently, please don't worry! Your Chan.</p>

<h3>She in Sickness</h3>
<p>— Luan Xue</p>
<p>This is a rainy night in early winter. The cold wind howls outside the house, and the rain patters against the glass windows. The room is as silent as death. All the people are chasing their good dreams, only the sick her is awake at this time. Her pale face, rapid breathing, and sunken, lifeless eyes show that she is terminally ill.</p>
<p>She often falls asleep in a daze and loses consciousness, knowing that she is not far from death, but she is not terrified or sad, because the stimuli she has received are too deep. She hopes for the early arrival of death, so that she can escape from pain and bid farewell to this man-eating society forever. Her eyes are looking at the top of the tent, longing for all her past! A dreamlike life, in her weak mind, suddenly arises boundless feelings.</p>
<p>How beautiful her childhood was. Her kind grandmother, dear father and mother, how much they cherished her. At that time, she was like a happy angel, living happy days without worry or sorrow. But how long ago was that? Her grandmother died, and her father also fell ill and never recovered. Evil fate began from then on. For their own selfishness, her older brother and sister-in-law urged her mother to marry her off. Her mother also hoped that she would find a place to settle down soon, in order to fulfill her long-cherished wish. As the saying goes, "When the father dies, the older brother is in charge." She could not help but be independent. From then on, she lost her freedom and sacrificed her life's happiness.</p>
<p>The wickedness of her mother-in-law, the unscrupulousness of her husband, and the life of a slave for several years made her suffer countless torments and pains. Several times she wanted to commit suicide, but when she thought of her elderly mother, she was afraid that she would suffer in pregnancy, so she did not have the courage to commit suicide. Not long ago, she gave birth to a boy, but unfortunately, because of congenital deficiency, he went to heaven in a few days, and her treatment after that was even more unimaginable; her heart, which had been deeply hurt, could no longer withstand the postpartum torment.</p>
<p>She thought of the happiness of her childhood, the loveliness of her girlhood, but now everything is over. Her youth has long since passed, and her active mind has long since died. Even this last breath is still lingering in pain. Ah! Who made her like this? Whose fault? Whose fault...</p>
<p>The rain was weeping pattering, and the wind was howling as if it was unfair to her. Her consciousness gradually blurred in the sound of the wind howling and the rain.</p>

<p>Actor's Self-Narration</p>
<h3>What Does It Mean to Be an "Actor"?</h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>How convenient it is to be an actor, as long as you can laugh and cry, right? No, no, it's definitely more than that.</p>
<p>Actors can be divided into two types, one is the puppet-style actor, and the other is the actor with a soul. What is a puppet-style actor? An actor is completely alienated from the script he or she is performing, and even does not understand at all what class, what environment, and what personality the character he or she is playing is. He or she is just listening to the director's instructions and temporarily becomes a genius puppet. An actor with a soul not only has a considerable understanding of the character in the play he or she is portraying, but also clearly understands the entire script and the personalities of all the characters in the play: a director's affairs are naturally more complex than an actor's by more than ten times, so sometimes there are inevitably places that cannot be taken care of. This is the responsibility of every actor. Such an actor must have a soul, and only with a soul can he or she become an actor.</p>
<p>Although I know that an actor has a soul, I strive to understand society and everything in the play, but this is really a difficult task, and I cannot bear my responsibility! The responsibility of an actor.</p>
<p>I once wrote a script, and I hope that in my own script I can gradually become an actor. It is extremely ridiculous to say that the script I wrote is nothing more than a portrait of myself. I really don't know how many facts I will have to write about in the future; now I am starting to write the second script, and there are two other scripts still in the planning stage.</p>

<h3>Regarding Subtitles in Sound Films</h3>
<p>— Yi Lie</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Actions, Reduce Subtitles</p>
<p>Modern Chinese sound films cannot achieve excellent results, and we should forgive them, because sound films in China are still in their infancy! Therefore, filming techniques and various experiences are naturally not comparable to those of the elder brother, Hollywood.</p>
<p>Let me talk about the subtitles in modern Chinese sound films.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about foreign sound films. Apart from the names of the production company, director, and actors at the beginning of the film, subtitles are rarely seen. Only in extremely tortuous plots are a few subtitles written to explain!</p>
<p>Speaking of our Chinese sound films, in addition to the indispensable subtitles with the company and actor names at the beginning, subtitles are often added in the middle of the main drama to explain actions and facts that are not shown. This is truly superfluous. The audience not only does not find it interesting but also finds it annoying, with no lingering aftertaste. Take the recent Tianyi masterpiece "Traces of the Orchid Valley" as an example. There are many superfluous parts in it, such as "That Night," "Jin Huilan's Family," "Ying Qigui's Family," etc., which are subtitles that viewers find annoying.</p>
<p>The director adds many subtitles intending to explain the plot to viewers who do not understand it; this is the director guessing wrong. The audience's level of understanding of the film may not be as superficial as the director thinks! Moreover, it can also be expressed through dialogue or more filming.</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's films are all silent films, but his subtitles are very few, avoiding many unnecessary subtitles as much as possible. However, everyone who has seen his films understands them, which is of course because his actions can replace explanations and express the plot.</p>
<p>Sound films use actions and words to express the plot, and subtitles can be omitted.</p>
<p>Therefore, sound films should avoid many superfluous subtitles. Even in silent films, reducing subtitles and paying attention to the expression of actions instead of subtitles will make the film more interesting and have a lingering aftertaste. I ask the Chinese directors, do you agree?</p>
<h3>Search If You Want To</h3>

<p>Joan Blondell has a strange habit: she likes to search other people's suitcases or handbags. Once, she saw an unfamiliar gentleman holding a small suitcase. She ran over and said to him very enthusiastically, "I beg you to let me search your suitcase. I am willing to pay five dollars for it." She is not a government detective, nor is she trying to discover any secrets or steal anything from people. According to her own words, she simply has this kind of need in her heart.</p>

<h3>The Lack of Comedies in Domestic Films (1)</h3>
<p>— Dao Sheng</p>
<p>The lack of comedies in domestic films is reminiscent of the Soviet Union's "Total Mobilization of Laughter."</p>
<p>Comedies make people feel happy, forget their worries, and turn sorrow into joy. Laughter is beneficial to the body and mind, which has long been established. However, if we examine domestic films, they are mostly martial arts films, supernatural films, social films, and erotic films: comedies are as rare as phoenix feathers. The so-called "toad wanting to eat swan meat" and the recently released "Chicken and Duck Couple" are examples. Directors seem to look down on comedies.</p>
<p>Moreover, in foreign films, even in non-comedies, there are often comedic interjections, which often make the audience laugh and lift their spirits. In domestic films, this aspect does not seem to be noticed either.</p>
<p>Given the continuous import of foreign comedies, will film companies run by Chinese people also awaken?</p>
<h3>(2) After Watching "Chicken and Duck Couple"</h3>
<p>— Gu Buwen</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the Central Grand Theater distributed its flyers and published its advertisements to promote Liu Chunshan's "Chicken and Duck Couple," which was released in Shanghai. They spared no effort in promotion, saying things like "Chaplin's formidable opponent," "Warning to Lloyd Bacon to wake up," "S. Z. Sakall will laugh three times even with a straight face," and "Laurel and Hardy are so anxious that they dare not cheat." This kind of slogan, plus the title of the film, "Chicken and Duck Couple," literally means that it must be extremely funny. Therefore, it attracted me, a two-dollar moviegoer, to endure the pain of upgrading and join the ranks of four-dollar moviegoers. (Omission)</p>
<p>After watching these two Chinese comedies, I think we have not yet found a formidable opponent to resist Chaplin, nor is it enough to warn Lloyd Bacon to wake up. S. Z. Sakall may have three sarcastic sneers after watching it, and Laurel and Hardy may not understand it at all. In short, comedic expressions do not necessarily have to be slapstick. Originally, people's small movements and actions all have reasonable comedic situations. There is no need to be extremely fierce, make a scene, go crazy, chase, jump, and leap just to make the audience laugh, without any value for recollection. This is my loyal advice to Chinese comedies.</p>
<h3>(3) Thoughts on the Future of Domestic Comedies</h3>
<p>— Xing Su</p>
<p>Comedy films have their own art and position, and it is by no means simply making people laugh. They can go deeper than other films, piercing the depths of society or humanity. The reason why comedy films are not easy to perform and not easy to produce to the satisfaction of the audience is a definite reason. (Omission)</p>
<p>The performance of this "Chicken and Duck Couple" should be forgiven to some extent. Most of these actors are accustomed to singing on stage. Working in front of the camera is really the first time for them. They all lack experience, and there are many flaws. The directing and photography techniques are also too poor. The script is the same as other failed comedies, not escaping from being close to making a scene and absurdly bad. It will make people feel cold. After watching this "Chicken and Duck Couple," I thought about the future of domestic comedies. But I hope they will continue to work hard! (Omission)</p>
<p>A Brief History of a Star</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Tallulah Bankhead's Childhood (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>One day, her golden hair braided into small braids, she ran into the house, breathing quickly. Her grandparents said, "When I grow up, I want to be an actress." Her discerning aunt did not argue with her about her mistakes; she adapted to the circumstances and allowed her curiosity to develop. Therefore, Tallulah often practiced graceful postures, wanting to prepare to become a star when she grew up.</p>
<p>However, she was still afraid of her grandparents' strict control, so she often thought of using a trick to escape this hateful family. She finally agreed with June to sneak away to a convent in Washington, D.C., where they were sent to study at St. John's College. In this college, she was the most beautiful girl.</p>
<p>After this naughty trick, fearing that her sisters would report her to her family, she wrote a long and pious letter to her grandparents, saying that she was willing to become a nun and live in the convent forever. At the age of fourteen, Tallulah graduated.</p>
<p>She said: "The education I received was ridiculous. I only chose to study what I liked the most, French. I was most impatient with arithmetic. It was simply a waste of time."</p>
<p>When Tallulah was seventeen years old, she made her debut in Washington. However, her father, Bankhead, had already become a senator, so he hoped that his beautiful daughter would continue her previous lovely social life, but Tallulah was unwilling.</p>
<p>Before she went to Washington, in her hometown, she once secretly sent her photo to a beauty contest. On the day of the announcement, she saw her photo published in a magazine, with a "?" mark underneath, because she wanted to keep it a secret, so she did not fill in her name when she sent it. This was the most exciting day of her childhood. In the contest, she had already won; therefore, her various future affairs were also decided.</p>
<p>She took the magazine and ran home, panting, and turned out the book to show her family, saying that she wanted to go on stage again to try it out. This was in 1918, and she was sixteen years old. Although she decided to become an actress, her family felt lonely because Tallulah left, and they did not approve of it.</p>
<p>Tallulah's father also had the idea of becoming an actor in his childhood, but he was finally persuaded by his parents to study law. Now, he cannot think of a way to change the will of his beautiful daughter.</p>
<p>Judging from the above, Tallulah's idea of becoming a star had already been formed in her childhood. In addition, she was not afraid of the obstacles of adversity, so she was able to achieve her current status, which is truly not an accidental thing. She is now thirty years old. Her fighting spirit continues to grow with age. If Marlene Dietrich returns to her country after her contract expires in December this year, then Tallulah has a good chance of winning the queen seat of Paramount next year. "Where there is a will, there is a way," this is also a clear proof. (The End)</p>

<h3>Recent News from Tianyi Company</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Qiu Qixiang's first work after rejoining Tianyi Company, "Traces of the Orchid Valley," has received good reviews after its public release. The company even considers it their representative work in the past ten years. It is now heard that the second work, "Little Actress," has also been completed and will soon be released at the New Light Theater. The film stars Yuan Meiyun, who is a famous female Peking opera singer. This is her first time on camera, and it is said that her performance is extremely moving.</p>
<p>Li Minghui has not yet filmed a movie since joining Tianyi. The reason is that the script was written by her father, Li Jinhui. Although the script has been written, it still needs to be revised to be perfect. As soon as the script is ready, filming can begin.</p>
<p>Since Tianyi opened its sports field, employees, actors, and craftsmen have been exercising with great enthusiasm after work every day. The soccer field is especially lively. The Shao brothers also participate from time to time.</p>
<p>The company's recently filmed "Shanghai Double Mandarin Ducks" is directed by Shao Zuiweng and stars Hu Shan and Ma Loufen. The film deeply depicts the poison of inheritance. It will probably be completed in a week.</p>
<p>Since Chen Yumei advocated frugality, she has attracted the attention of people in society. The Zhejiang Public Association and the Road Association have hired her as the captain of the solicitation team, and various radio broadcasting stations have invited her to give speeches and sing. Ms. Chen feels overwhelmed by the demands.</p>
<p>The company has recently added one male and one female actor. The male's name is Bao Zhichao, and his face is quite similar to Zheng Xiaoqiu. The female's name is Ye Qiuxin, and her face is quite similar to Zhang Zhiyun. It is heard that these two actors are practicing. If they can work hard to study the art of performance, they have great hope for success.</p>
<h3>News from the Mingxing Company</h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Li Pingqian's first work after joining Mingxing Company, "Old Hatred and New Sorrow," is scheduled to be released first at the Nanjing Capital Grand Theater on December . As for the public release location and date in this city, it will be around the middle of next month. Zhang Shichuan directed and Zhang Zhiyun starred in the sound film "Broken Love," and the overall results were not good. Ms. Zhang's tone and dialogue were even worse, and part of it may be re-filmed. However, the final decision is that the film will be temporarily shelved.</p>
<p>Since Li Pingqian, Sun Min, Wang Ying, Ai Xia, and a large number of new employees and actors joined Mingxing, there has been a division between the old and new factions within the company. Cooperation is not sufficient in form or spirit, which may hinder the company's future work.</p>
<p>The sound film "Flower of Freedom," directed by Zheng Zhengqiu and starring Hu Die, Zheng Xiaoqiu, and Gong Jianong, was screened at the Guanglu Grand Theater a few days ago and was highly regarded by the review circle. The authorities also believe that this film is the most valuable work of Mingxing in recent years and plan to promote it widely during the public release.</p>
<p>"Adventures on the Battlefield," directed by Zhang Shichuan and starring Hu Die, has completed one-tenth or two-tenths. Recently, because Director Zhang has not found a location for outdoor scenes, work has been temporarily suspended. Once found, it will continue.</p>
<p>As I See It</p>
<h3>All Kinds of People in Movie Theaters</h3>
<p>— Dao Sheng</p>
<p>There are all kinds of people in movie theaters, and they all have their own purposes. Now, let's briefly analyze them:</p>
<p>(1) Modern youths: They often go with the opposite sex, aiming to use the love stories in the films to promote the degree of their love.</p>
<p>(2) Wives: They are tired of watching Peking opera and supernatural stage plays, so they come to the movie theater to stroll around and adjust themselves.</p>
<p>(3) Gentlemen and merchants: Leisurely gentlemen and wealthy fat merchants watch one or two movies every week to relax and relieve boredom.</p>
<p>(4) Poor guys: Poor guys have no extra money to enjoy themselves. How can they be guests of movie theaters? However, according to my own experience, whenever I am troubled and cannot stand the boredom, I will go to a cheap movie theater to watch a movie. The purpose is to temporarily forget the pain and give the body and mind a moment of intoxication.</p>
<p>(5) Film critics: Film critics visit movie theaters with a mission, which is very different from the purpose of the above four types of people. They focus all their attention on the merits of the plot, the excellence of the directing techniques, the expressions of the protagonist and supporting actors, and other issues, in order to provide a basis for their reviews.</p>

<h3>From Anger to Alarm</h3>
<p>The third formula for practicing expressions alone is the transition from anger to alarm. In our first formula for practicing alone, the transition from blurred to attentive, the eye sockets have already widened a lot. In the second formula, the transition from attentive to anger, the eye sockets have doubled in size. Now, in the third formula, we gradually increase the glaring eyes of anger to the point where they cannot be increased any further, holding our breath, and even our mouths cannot be closed. This is the expression of extreme panic, which is also the expression of the extreme widening of the eye sockets.</p>
<p>Generally, when a person suddenly encounters a very terrible phenomenon and still has a little resistance, the eye sockets will naturally suddenly enlarge. This is a proper manifestation of the instinct of self-defense. However, when there is no way to resist or no strength to resist, the eye sockets will suddenly close. You see, when children are playing, they suddenly fall, and their eyes will close very tightly, as if they are afraid of death or waiting to die.</p>
<p>The practice method of the third formula is similar to the previous two formulas. First, put the eyes in a state of anger, and then inhale sharply, counting exactly eight numbers, and gradually widen the eye sockets to transition to a state of alarm. At the same time, the mouth also gradually enlarges to a state of gaping. Hold this breath and maintain this state, counting silently in your heart: "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight." Then, when exhaling this breath, gradually reduce the size of the eye sockets and mouth, returning to an attentive state. When exhaling this breath, also count silently from "one" to "eight" as before.</p>
<p>After continuing to practice three times, close your eyes and rest for one minute.</p>
