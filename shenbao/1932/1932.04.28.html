<p>翰</p>
<p>此次德國大選興登堡仍獲重選所得票數超過希特勒六百萬票論者都以德國政局可保現狀歐洲和平亦不致破裂爲慶惟希特勒雖落選而其所獲票數竟占全額三分之一其所掬示於世人者爲希特勒所領袖之國家社會黨從此已一躍而列爲大黨矣</p>
<p>大選以後接踵而起者有邦選舉連日電訊希特勒黨均獲勝利而尤以普魯士爲最竟從六席突增至一百六十二普魯士邦在歷史上爲統一德國之盟主在地理上其幅員與人口均占全國三分之二在政治上其一舉一動莫不可以鞭策全國故論者謂「能握普魯士之政權者不啻握得聯邦政府之政權」是則希特勒在普魯士邦選舉之勝利實含有深長之意義</p>
<p>黨德國大選籌備期間歐之政論家曾發如下之問題「希特勒之用意固何在乎目的在爭得國家之領袖（總統）乎政府之領袖（總理）乎抑欲兩者兼有之乎」今希特勒對於總統之競選雖告失敗而在普魯士邦之選舉則獲大勝然則希特勒之政治活動所謂失諸東隅者已收諸桑楡耶曰未可必也夫此次普邦選舉之結果社黨一躍而得一百六十二席但未得絕對多數擁護普邦總理白良朗之諸黨其所得之席數與國社黨相等是則白朗辭職以後邦普政權鹿死誰手猶未可知也此後對於政權之逐鹿可以舉足輕重者厥惟共產黨共黨今屈獲得五十七席若願棄票則可扶助希特勒攫得普邦之政權否則白朗可以聯合社會黨與教會黨而仍蟬聯普政府之總理也惟無論如何普政府之權威必將受國社黨之牽制而大減是故希特勒退則可以牽制普邦之政府使其捉襟爲難進則可以握普邦之政權與聯邦總理白魯寗相頡頏務使白魯寗不安於位聯邦議會宣告解散而後已昨德社會黨勃來萊區哀曾言「選舉揭曉以後普魯士已不復爲德國聯邦中民主主義進步之中心」可知此後希特勒將挾普魯士而臨全德其在政治上馳騁將日步莫索里尼之後塵矣</p>
<p>希特勒所領導之黨徒爲反共產反猶太之極端國家主義的集團其政綱與意大利之法西斯蒂相似此種極端右傾勢力之抬頭實爲德國現狀所西釀成法政論家白爾的勒米有言「政治上不安必將激引反動勢力掀起」而歷史所昭示我人者凡一國政治臨絕大之危機每引起獨裁這趨向俄國布爾札維克之勝利意車法西斯蒂之成功西班牙里維拉之一度專政以及波蘭里蘇斯基之重握政權皆爲此政治公律之有力證明德國自大戰以還受和約之壓迫肩賠償之重負經濟破產失業激增於是社會擾攘政治不安凡此皆足以助長希特勒勢力之膨脹膨脹願留心政治理論者依據經濟可以左右政治之原則幸忽視希特勒之活躍爲一時搗亂也可</p>

<p>期望日方接受英使方案</p>
<p>特委會定今日重開會議</p>
<p>將不規定完全撤退日期</p>
<p>僅聲明「最近之將來」字樣</p>
<p>路透社二十六日日內瓦電云十九國特委會本晚開會討論時間約歷一小時關於會議內容各代表均守緘默僅對新聞界發表下列公報「國聯大會特委會於下午三時三十分舉行非公開會議主席報告渠與中日代表談話之經過情形特委會茲悉駐華英公使藍溥森曾向中國政府提出新方案似足使兩國政府趨於同意日本政府尚在考慮中但不久將決定態度於此情形之下特委員認爲須暫候日政府之決定特委會將於本星期四日重行開會並擬於本星期杪舉行公開會議」聞主席希孟於會議時詳細報告渠與各方非正式談話之內容並其努力尋覓解決方法藉使雙方同意之經過情形渠謂此時目的尚未達到便仍須繼續努力云衆信今日會議中上海方面之折中辦法甚爲重要特委會希望上海會議得以告成俾特委會可於短期內重行開會策劃第二步之進行如上海方面雙方未能同意則特委會將舉行公開會議報告經過情形並召集全體大會</p>
<p>國民社二十六日日內瓦電云今日下午十九國委員會開會後主席希孟報告與中日代表談話情形謂渠希望日本將接受英使藍溥森提出之新方式委員會將於星期四再行開會討論能否於本星期杪以前舉行公開大會聞小國代表堅持國聯大會須於星期一重開至於所謂折衷新方式者聞係修改原擬草案第四項准混合委員會監督並報告日本撤兵進行狀況而不三分之一完全撤退日期僅聲明「最近之將來」字樣倘此折衷方案接受後則草案內第十一項將被刪去今日秘密會議係下午三時五十分開會五五時零七分散會</p>
<p>國民社二十六日日內瓦電云今日下午國聯大會十九國委員之秘密會議延至三時五十分開會討論情形聞以關於決議案草案性質及其解釋爲主</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十六日是內瓦電云據非正式之補充消息十九委員會似因某某會員之提議對於國聯調查團將其赴滿行程正式通知滿洲政府之消息曾交換意見但本日似尚無何制裁此外關於上海會議據聞十九委員會有相當理由認爲英使藍溥森之提案可望迅速接受有此提案則談判可詞表結束蓋藍使調停方案於其提出南京以前實際上似已先得到駐華日使之非正式同意現中政之正式答復耳十九委員會決定靜候此項答復至星期四爲止倘雙方均接受藍使方案則十九委員會之決議案將加以修改蓋十九委員會通過之決議案其第十一欵原規定停距條件內擬設之混合委員會得以大多數決定之法宣告原狀回復應行撤兵若照藍使方案則此項規定當即取消因藍使方案第三條只規定如遇不履行停戰條欵時混合委員會得向雙方提醒其所負之義務顯然與前述之第十一條不同故也藍使提出新方案之時已取得上海有關係列強公使之同意日內瓦日本人士似以爲東京方面對藍使此種提案將有同意之答復云　　日聯社廿六日日內瓦電云今晚十時日代表團接到日政府回訓其內容主張將藍溥森折衷辦法插入委員會決議第十一項中長岡大使即以電話通知委員會國聯當局希望早時解決此問題</p>
<p>路透電二十七日日內瓦電云中日接受英藍使新方案之消息已令陰霾散滅而十九國特委會草案之障礙亦可因以消除小國之準備要求中立國有以一種方式規定日軍撤退日期之權者今亦欣然接受新方案將以此爲日本誠意最後之試騐最強硬諸小國之一其代表今日語路透訪員曰中日爭案如長此由國聯主持調解則干預使中日滿意之任何解決實非吾人之事務日本茍能尊重條約之精神則愉快之結局自屬可能耳</p>
<p>路透社二十七日倫教電云日政府所予重光葵接受英藍使所定新方案之訓令此間消息靈通各界皆表示歡迎咸謂遠東大局之和緩因以可更進一步但對於滿洲仍抱恐慌衆意該地大局日見阽危日軍之撲滅滿洲騷亂更易促成對俄之戰事孟卻斯特指導報今日載一社論謂列強雖未公開否認國聯會章但曾反對會章之實施致令國聯爲人蔑視而被玩弄於日本軍閥之掌握日本已以其態度表明今日之世界仍可供帝國主義者之侵略而得安然無虞就各種觀察點論之此誠可悲之事也云云</p>

<p>滬停戰會候國聯指示再進行</p>
<p>對國難會議經過作詳細雄辯</p>
<p>並力斥不滿意訓政者之錯誤</p>
<p>因爲無國民黨便無中華民國</p>
<p>國民黨中央常委汪精衛、二十五日晨在紀念週</p>
<p>報告大要如下、「本週內經過的事情、可以報告的、是關於外交和政治兩方面、在外交方面、上海停戰會議雖已停頓、並不是破裂、現在只等國聯特委會得到決議後、再斟酌進行、至國聯調查團、現已到東北、從前滿洲傀儡政府曾拒絕我國體表入東北今我國代表受政府訓令已同調查團一齊到了東北、他們現已開始調查、預備在五月一日、將第一次的報告書寄到國聯關、於政治方面、今天想報告的有幾點、第一二中全會議決籌設各級民意機關、中政會議決交行政院審議辦理、行政院因此屢次開會、上星期六、已詳細討論得一大體的議決、本來各級民意機關、有市縣省的幾種、現在決先從市的民意機關着手、已将草案備好、本週内繼續會議、略加修改、便可通過、并咨送立法院議决、草案不重在條文、而注重在確定籌備的程序、擬從五月起、以三個月爲期、將市自治的幾件重要工作做好、然後在兩個月內召集市參議會現在的市分爲三種、一是直屬國府、如京滬平青等、一是普通市、如廣州等、一是定名而未成立的市、各在全國各地方中較易集中起來、故地方自治、先從市着手進行、亦比較容易、將來行政院議定草案後、當一面咨送立法院、一面公開發表、以備各同志及各界注意討論、其次、關於國民代表會的經過、在去年十二月一中全會時、有三種提案、一是國難會議、一是國民救國會、一是國民代表會、當時對於國難會議、已經決定召集、並決定討論範圍爲禦侮綏靖救濟三項、至國民救國會與國民代表會、則交由中常會審議、國難會議會員是由政府聘任、而國民救國會與國民代表會、則由人民選舉、性質不同、權限亦異、當國難會議開會前、有幾個會員、要求在禦侮救災綏靖三項範圍之外、還要討論政治問題、兄弟答以國難會議範圍、是由一中全會決定、由國府交行政院的、在這三項以外的問題、雖可自由討論、行政院確無答覆的權力、但不料平滬會員、頗有政府限制討論範圍的說話、兄弟以爲事實具在、認爲無答辯必要、後來國難會議在洛開會、除禦侮救災綏靖三項問題外、還有政治的提案、尤其是關於訓政憲政的問題、有種種的意見、以其中的兩個極端而言、一是主張即時結束訓政、實行憲政、並且在實行憲政以前、改組政府的性質、使他成爲不是國民黨以黨治國的政府、一是主張國難會議、不應該討論訓政憲政的問題、這種問題、應該由國民黨五全大會解決、在這兩種極端的意見中、還有許多不同的主張、所以當時提案審查委員、先將各種主張作客觀的分柝、整理好了、把各個相同的要點、列舉出來、向大衆報告、經大會一天的激烈討論、然後第二天審查委員會報告自己主觀的判斷、他們贊成的是、第一請政府如期結束訓政、召集國民大會、起草憲法、第二在國民大會以前、先召集國民代表會、其權限爲議預算決算、內外公債、及重要國際條約、這種提案、當經在場五分之四會員、贊成通過、這種提案、是武昌北平各大學的教授所連署的、其中有些是黨內的人、有些是黨外的人、可見得不是出自一黨的意思的、提案通過之後、兄弟表示、以行政院院長的資格、固然不能答覆一定可以採納、即以中央委員的資格、也沒有此權力、但是將來必定可以將此議案提到中央、請求中央決議採納、如此可見他們所謂不許提出禦侮救災綏靖三項以外的問題、是完全沒有根據的、至於現在、他們又說國難會議的會員、大多數是由官吏及黨人所搆成、這是更與事實相背、如果我們把國難會議的會員名單來看、官吏黨人固有、但是黨外的人更多、再以國難會議的提案而言、屬於黨員者很少、而屬於黨外的人者很多、可見他們的誣蔑、是沒有根據的、此次羅家倫同志由北平回來、他對兄弟說、現在有幾個人說汪精衛主張國民代表會、最好黨員完全不當選、這句說話、完全平空製造的、不獨兄弟絕沒有說這句話、而且國民代表會的代表、旣由民選、則與黨員不黨員有什麼關係呢、可說他們平空造謠、是無所不至的、上次中央政治會議、經已指定同志起草民選立法監察委員的草案、而關於國民救國會國民代表會、亦已推定同志來合併詳細審查、大槪今天下午開會可以得有結果、能否通過、兄弟不得而知、以上都是事實的報告、依照黨章、各種問題在未得決議前、大家儘可盡量發揚個人意見、但議決後、必須一致奉行、這是民主集權的基本原則、也是我們所當實行的、所以兄弟還有一些個人的意見、要附帶提出來、關於訓政的問題現在有兩種論調、第一種以爲講民主政治、就是失了訓政的意義、第二種以爲講民主政治、就可以不講訓政、這兩種論調、依兄弟看來、都是錯誤的、兄弟以前說過、我們要有自責心、同時要有自信力、第一種論調、以爲講民主政治是失了訓政的意義、便是失了自責心、第二種論調、以爲講民主政治、可以不講訓政、便是失了自信力、我們知道我們遵依總理遺教、訓政時期、最重要的工作、便是培養民權、所以在訓政時期當中、人民的權力、在時間上、是一天一天的增加、在空間上、是一天一天的擴大、如果以爲講民主政治是失了訓政的意義、那麼、便是將訓政的過程、變成共產黨的以黨專政一樣、這是完全誤解總理所謂訓政以培養民權的意義的、但是第二種的論調、以爲講民主政治、可以不講訓政、也是錯誤、現在黨外的人很多有這種議論、自從民國元年起、黨外的人、就有這種共同一貫的主張、這便是打倒國民黨、所以民元袁世凱做了總統後、黨外的人爲何一致集合在袁世凱之下、爲什麼呢、因爲他們要打倒國民黨、現在他們又一致的主張要取消訓政、爲什麼他們要取消訓政呢、也是要打倒國民黨、不過從前打倒國民黨的方法、是破壞憲政、因爲當時的臨時約法憲法、都是國民黨黨員製做出來制裁袁世凱和鞏固民國的基礎的、所以他們要打倒國民黨、便要破壞憲政、因此在民國二年帮助袁世凱解散國會、破壞憲法、民國六年又再解散國會、破壞憲法、他們第一步要打倒國民黨第二步就連中華民國都要打倒、因爲中華民國是國民黨所做出來的、這便是民國以來一班官僚政客的聯合戰線、他們從前要打倒國民黨、現在還是要打倒國民黨、但是他們以前的口號、是破壞憲政而現在的口號、却是要擁護憲政了、因爲要借擁護憲政之名、然後可以破壞訓政、這我們應該認識得清清楚楚、總理致力於國民革命、凡四十年、從前的約法憲法、都是國民黨所做成、國民黨與中華民國、是有最密切的關係、可以說、如果沒有國民黨、就斷斷沒有中華民國、試看民國元年以後、國民黨亡命之時、就是中華民國風雨飄搖之際、現在他們要打倒國民黨、正就是中華民國危急存亡之秋、如果沒有了國民黨則訓政的前途、固不堪問、而憲政的前途、更不堪問、他們現在疾首痛心於中國至今還沒有憲政、但是這是什麼原故呢、這是自從民國成立以來、憲政都被他們一次二次三次破壞盡了、他們又說、這幾年來、國民黨做得不好、但是有事實可以證明的、民國元年、國民黨在南京、只有幾個月、是不是有充分的機會、由民國十七年或十八年訓政開始起、至今只有三年的時期、如果沒有內部的一切糾紛當然是可以做得比較好些、但是以中國之大、其範圍之遼闊、情形之複雜、若謂以一二年便可以將中國完全做好、這是誰也做不到的、如果我們懷疑到訓政之路是不通、這不是懷疑訓政時期的工作不良、而是懷疑總理訓政的主張、政府因有內部的種種糾紛、以至未能將協助人民籌備自治的工作做妥、所以政府因此而延長訓政、是有理由的、但是我們決不能因此而連訓政都要取消、復次爲什麼我們現在不能有國民大會呢、這是因爲現在憲政還未有開始的原故、但是國民代表會與國民大會不同、依據建國大綱的規定、在五院成立以前、就可以有國民代表會、由每個完成自治之縣、選出國民代表一員、參預中央政治參預二字、是非常淸楚的、所以國民代表會的權限、是與國民大會的權限不同、國民大會、是國家的最高機關、而國民代表會、一方面是民主勢力的反影、一方面是訓政時期的一種機關、關於這一點、有很多同志、尚沒有認識清楚、以爲國民代表會、便是國民大會、這是非常的疏忽、如果我們明白這一點、便可以明白訓政時期國民代表會的意義、至於黨外的人、以爲如此便可以推翻訓政、更可以覺悟了今天兄弟所想說的話、大槪如此、上半段是報告這一週內的外交政治的經過情形、下半段是陳述個人的意見、我們希望在訓政時期、努力培養民權、使訓政從速完成、憲政從速開始</p>

<p>— 憶秋自蘇寄</p>
<p>週遊全球之吉日羅博士。爲土耳其隣國高加索人。自一九一八年入中國國民黨。即矢志闡揚三民主義。喚起弱小民族。以謀世界大同之實現。前年春。入中國境。游歷各地。迄今已行遍十七省。疇昔之日。吉博士偕其譯員喬君由杭蒞蘇。庽金門之新閶旅社。本埠各界往謁者甚衆。余佩其精神之偉大。特往訪之。蒙發表談話。語頗警惕。而對抗日之道。尤多切要。聆之感奮。爰摘要記之如下。（以下均吉君言）日本併吞東北。固係有計劃之行動。但亦有鑒於中國民智劇進。遲則恐不易下手。故於九一八斷然發難。詎中國非但不加抵抗。且忍辱求全。乞哀於國聯。弱點畢露。以致滬案繼起。然中國猶不自覺。全國數百萬雄兵。竟僅第十九路與第五路二軍與抗。當然寡不敵衆。不至一敗涂地。已屬萬幸。而政府當局。猶依賴國聯。不圖自決。直令人百思莫解。蓋余深知國聯為列強之大本營。弱國決不能得其絲毫之扶助。質言之。求國聯猶羔羊遇難。求援於豺狼。適自速其亡耳。中國現在唯一救亡之道。祇有喚起全國民衆。節衣縮食。購備軍火。準備武力抵抗。全國軍隊均開赴邊境。實行自衛。全國民衆。切實對日經濟絕交。則一年後可致日於瘋癱狀態。兩年後對日可不攻自滅矣。更有一極堪注意之事。望君轉告貴國同胞。余道經香港。晤白俄將軍列倫夫人。據謂所有白俄。均受日人給養。刻已集中各地。俟機搗亂中國。由是觀之。中國已似一葉孤舟。困於大風浪中。前後左右。均有敵人。若不急起圖之。則禍臨眉睫矣</p>

<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>此次日兵犯境。嘉定全縣完全淪入敵手。該縣居民大都遷避靑浦一帶。昨晤舊友張君。述及渠鄕馬陸。被日軍蹂躪情形。慘不忍聞。爰拾一二。以誌哀痛（一）馬陸爲南翔至嘉定之要道。約有居戶數百。店舖二三十家。滬戰發生後。日人喬裝鄕民赴該鎭偵探軍情被保衛團所拘。經張君之叔略詢後。從輕釋放。詎此次日軍佔據鎭後。前獲之日探。反誣指張君之叔爲便衣隊首領。已綁至中心小學操場上。預備槍決。幸有曾在虹口日商店爲夥之某君。與有戚誼。操日語而證明其向開藥店。年近古稀。性慈善而信佛。斷非便衣隊首領。得免於難。（二）馬陸附近某村農民王姓老嫗。年逾花甲。精神矍鑠。平素率領兒媳。從事農業。勤懇異常。十九路軍退至第二道防綫時。鄰近居民相率遠避。渠不忍拋棄數十年胼手胝足所造之家庭。乃飭兒媳逃避他鄕。己則坐守家園。以觀動靜。日軍抵鎭後。四出搜檢。至其家翻箱倒篋。飽掠而去。臨行見嫗以手按胸。疑懷軍火。令其脫去衣服。以備檢查。嫗堅執不允。致被槍殺。厥後兒媳返家。僅見血跡。未覩屍首。尚望生還。不意前日荷鋤挖溝。發現一腿。將泥搬去。始見全身。據云渠因身畔藏有鈔幣。故不肯被搜。槍殺後。日兵盡擄所有。棄屍田野而去。</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>魚的燈光世界有幾處大海大洋。那水的深度。足足有五英里。下面一片烏黑。任何的光線不能達到。因此水的壓力極強。雖是在那烏黑的水深之處。却有許多奇怪的魚住在那裏。決不會相撞。因爲大自然賦與它們一盞燈。各自當頭照着。可以照見游行之路。毫無阻碍。那種亮光是很奇怪的。原來有幾種微生物。會發出燐光。千千萬的聚族而居。成了一個明亮的殖民地。它們往往住在魚鱗的中間。看過去就一片光明。有的魚却自己開着电燈廠。因爲它們的鱗片自會發光。無需微生物帮忙了。又有許多海底的魚。它們將兩個眼睛裝在長長的肉梗上。凸出在前。也可作明燈之用。更奇怪的。有的魚在鼻子中生出一根肉梗。而在梗頭上裝着一盞小燈。恰臨在它那挺大的下牙牀骨之上。小魚們見了燈光游上來看着玩。就给它一口吞下肚子去了。</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第五回　負義絕交不幸招逢毫客怒　關情定策最難消受美人恩</p>
<p>事後安家寨已燒殺得十室九空。只餘滿地屍骸。一片瓦礫。牛黑風才算出了口惡氣。仍帶着匪衆退走。等到官兵聞訊再開了來救援。牛黑風已經又走得很遠。徒徒犧牲了一座安家寨罷咧。安大奎見已闖下大禍。嚇得連夜逃出了匪區。仍回軍署供職。好在他家眷早已帶在外邊。究於他毫無傷損。如今又霸占了個商號的財產。就索興連自己的親姪兒也不肯認。看將起來。這個人利慾薰心。無論對家族。對朋友。都這樣的不夠人。魏卓謀一談到這憤慨塡膺的時候。不由暫時收拾起嬉笑的態度也發出極激烈的主張。勸安玉田應告訴一般同鄕。連合起來向他辦理問罪。安玉田在旁吞聲飲泣。唏噓不已。到此忽然長嘆一聲道。大奎叔做的事。固然是不應該。但牛黑風究是個萬惡的土匪。與我已是不共戴天。我不能先對外人報仇。卻只知與家裏人算賬爭產。未免也還是不像話。算了罷。如今我拚着不要他供給我的用費了。難道世界這般大。我安玉田以昂藏七尺之軀。就不能自立謀生嗎。魏卓謀旋即笑了起來道。好的。你眞有志氣。我佩服你了。說着偷眼向梁笑雲一看。只見伊始終保持着幽默的狀態。不在旁妄贊一詞。卻將一雙妙目骨溜骨溜地儘向魏卓謀這一邊轉動着。彷佛表示伊話是想要說的。只是礙着你在這裏不便說出。魏卓謀善解人意。便起自告辭道。我應該報告的話都說完了。不能再不識相。賴在這兒做一個討厭的人。還是鴨蛋不生脚先開我的滾。讓你們二位靜靜的談一會兒心吧。說罷。嬉皮笑臉的夾着一本書。又顚头播脑的跑啦。梁笑雲也不挽留。仍然很沉靜的在書房裏與安玉田相對坐着。安玉田只顧低着头唉聲嘆氣。就也與梁笑雲別無話說移時。梁笑雲伸了個懶腰。那一聲嬌慵的吁喘。驚動了安玉田。不覺抬頭望了伊一眼。卻正與梁笑雲那迷宕而軟餳的眼神交觸個正着。安玉田剛覺一呆。梁笑雲云卻也雙頰微紅。笑吟吟地掙出一句話來道。我有些倦乏了。你陪我到那邊屋子裏。大家躺一會兒談談。好不好呢。</p>

<p>— 金</p>
<p>閘北自經嚴重的砲火後善良居民、俱已逃亡房屋廬舍、都成瓦礫、凄凉萬状、鬼哭神嚎幾爲無人烟區域、</p>
<p>於是有閘北的趙欣伯、閘北的鄭孝胥等、狐假虎威、虎憑狐勢、組織什麼「僞地方維持會」等名目、這種亂徒、自有國家法律來制裁、我且不管、</p>
<p>現在日本又利用韓人、殖民閘北、一方在大連靑島的朝鮮人、經日當局授意、紛組商業考察團來滬視察閘北、一方從靑島移來高麗妓女三班、供日兵的淫樂、　　照這樣看來、閘北的世界、旣呈什麼現象？萬一有志氣的我國人民、决不願竟到閘北去居住、並且不願意去看這樣的狀況、現在停戰會議、雖有轉機之說、昨日正開起草委員會、但我總不信有任何結果、因爲停戰會議、已開多時、今朝聽聽如此、明日看看又如此、試問這樣會議、有怎樣價值呢？</p>
<p>總之在日兵未曾撤盡以前、非但閘北不能去、即鄰近閘北、凡在日軍勢力範圍之內、任何地方多不能去、免受一般漢奸的威逼和侮辱、</p>

<p>國聯派調查團前往東北視察、本來是滑稽而敷衍的舉動、張學良素抱不抵抗主義、東北原無戰事痕跡可言、僞滿洲國一幕傀儡戲、誰也不知爲金蟬脫殼之計、試問調查團前往調查些什麼？</p>

<p>— 周瑞銓·</p>
<p>以前的人常想着·怎樣才能使我們用的水保持牠的溫度，就是科學家也常想·怎樣才能保持液化氣體至數小時之久，因爲當你使某種氣體成爲液體時，如果不設法保存起來，牠就要因外界的溫度繼續蒸發仍舊成爲氣體，因爲牠在常溫中是氣體狀況，比如氧氣氮氣氫氣等，在常溫中，均屬氣態，自從蘇格蘭雕阿，Ｊａｍｅｓ　Ｄｅｗａｒ（1842＿1923）這柆科學家，發明引眞空瓶後，這種能保溫的瓶子（就是我們常說的熱水瓶）便成功了，牠的道理，有用雙壁玻瓶（內一層，外一層）將中間的空氣，用喞筒完全抽出，即成了眞空，如果把熱水放進去，這時候對流傳導熱的出入力量，除口部塞子處稍稍有一點外，全瓶再也找不着了，瓶的外壁内層，和內壁外層，都被上一些水銀，使其作用如鏡，能反射落於其上的輻射，熱因只傳導對流輻射爲傳熱的方法，因此三者均與外界溫度相隔，所以這瓶內的東西，才能長時間保持牠的溫度，如果把液化的氣體，－這種液化的氣體的溫度，總在攝氏零度下一百度以下，－或是冷的東西放進去，他的溫度也和外界的相隔絕，所以也能保持長時間的溫度，</p>

<p>天晚了，淺紅淡綠的燦爛燈光，把「大世界」附近的景物照耀得有如白晝一樣，高聳天空的洋樓下，擠着成百成千的人們，男的，女的老的，幼的他們的臉袋上，大都是蘊藏着滿面春光，而是愛在那裏徘徊蕩漾，</p>
<p>「別克」，「道奇」鮮麗的汽車，一輛·他在光滑而平坦的愛多亞路上，風馳電掣的駛往，叭…叭…的聲音裏，似乎是「馬達客」裏的巨商紳士，太太小姐們意氣洋洋的說，『這是咱們的福氣哩！』</p>
<p>近旁林立的電影院，咖啡店，跳舞廳，勾引了一般摩登情侶；交頭接耳，情話綿綿，一對對的向裏跑；以消磨他們整個的晚，爲它們追求，沉醉。</p>
<p>馬路邊上紅紅綠綠的姑娘們，日處於十八層地獄裏，勉強製造人工的「曲綫美」，婀娜驕態的一排一羣陳列着；以圖博得問花尋柳的朋友們好，像追臭逐羶的蠅蚋般的跟了她們走，</p>
<p>『臥雲山人』，『廬山道人』的預言家，更是不勝其數，每只機檯上，公然也有一兩個老婆婆，三四個苦朋友，被那暗淡沉沉的煤油燈光吸住；目不旁瞬地望着那塊寫着「貧窮不取分文，相不空談」的玻璃板，而且還嘮哩嘮叨地問說：怎樣呌做『父在母先亡』？怎是『穿我的鼻子，吃我的耳躲』？</p>
<p>牆角弄堂裏，有種白相人；怪難聽的喊着：『要押育速押，勿押马上開……』有的是會哈哈笑；也有的倒是呆木木。</p>
<p>剛從××宮裏飽醉再來的福氣有錢人，少不了迎頭遇着鳩形鶉衣的乞丐，跟着他們祝福祝壽的討着錢……</p>
<p>假如你不曉得上海究竟是怎樣那你只消跑到「大世界」前後看看包你剎那間即可見其寫眞一切的一切都好像是在描寫罪惡兩字的具體縮影雖然另一面也可見到交通的便利文化的發達其如終覺『瑜不掩瑕』何</p>

<p>— 嚴夢</p>
<p>有如血的時代在風浪中一樣，東西南北的流浪漂泊，像一朵離枝的花，脫幹的浮萍落葉，在入世的初期，懷著滿腔熱情，自然難免在夜闌人靜的深宵怨尤嘆惜，甚而至於落下無聊的淚點，如今，受了不健全的世故薰陶，飽經了人間的風霜，心靈之嫩葩早給摧殘了，除了在泥濘的街頭躞蹀，體味出來的人生，是煙一般的飄渺，夢一樣的無憑，</p>
<p>歲月的催老故國的愁思，生活的壓迫，低徊眷戀的青春是褪淡了，柔美的企圖，絢爛的幻夢，祇換上額上的衣食鞭痕，最不適宜於大都市的生活，最</p>
<p>不能安於勢利的街頭，偏偏又在那恥辱和罪惡構成的大城中，枯索的做個淪落人·</p>
<p>爲著心志未有小小的成就，才不願</p>
<p>毀滅，努力求生的結果，深入社會的核心之後，我纔認識反動的權威世，人易爲功利所誘惑，於是，誰都被征服了，低下頭，向惡勢力說一聲：「我是降服了」投身社會，彷彿就是離開了潔白淸明的樂園，靑年們，趕快自救吧！保持你們誠懇先明的心，提防黑暗中的陷阱·</p>
<p>爲著不可知的前程，希望在導引我</p>
<p>們前行，牠給我們的熱力，一切的刺激，正如玫瑰花旁的荆棘，然而，迎春之鳥在讚美，在歌唱，含著汪汪的眼淚活下去，原想是探個生之玄秘和究竟，可是，什麼都破滅了，魔魅佔據了天堂，留下我們純潔的人們在地窖中，他們還在咒咀，朋友們，我們是羊一樣的馴伏，那正是罪的「善良者」構成！爲什不舉起我們的臂—喊一聲：「努力」</p>

<p>昨日有朋友自閘北來，據說：現在之閘北，與砲聲隆隆，火光燭天時之閘北，畢竟有些兩樣了！現在是滿呈著和平的景像？雖是留着八鬚口唱「格大，格大」的還在那裏神氣活現！</p>
<p>在以前（自一二八以後），閘北之街上，眼睛所看到的，祇是些滿臉悲憤的良民，哭聲啼啼的男的，女的，老的，少的，現在呢？現在却是有一個個的烟徒，一堆堆的賭鬼，一羣羣的嫖客，浮現於街道之間！</p>
<p>他們是臉有笑容，好像是在說：「幸虧這次有人來光顧，否則，我們永遠沒有出頭的日子呢」？</p>
<p>的確閘北畢竟是和平了，「烟」「賭」，「嫖」三種的生意特別的興隆，他們是在過着快樂（？）的春天的生活了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Hitler and German Politics <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>By Han</p>
<p>Hindenburg's re-election in the recent German election, with a vote count exceeding Hitler's by six million, has led observers to believe that the current German political situation can be maintained, and European peace will not be disrupted, which is cause for celebration. However, even though Hitler lost the election, the fact that he garnered one-third of the total votes indicates to the world that the National Socialist Party, led by Hitler, has now risen to become a major party.</p>
<p>Following the general election were state elections, and daily telegraphs reported victories for Hitler's party. Prussia was especially significant, as the party suddenly increased its seats from six to one hundred and sixty-two. Historically, Prussia was the leader of unified Germany. Geographically, its area and population account for two-thirds of the country. Politically, its actions can influence the entire nation. Therefore, it is said that "whoever controls the government of Prussia controls the power of the federal government." Thus, Hitler's victory in the Prussian state election has a profound significance.</p>
<p>During the preparation period for the German general election, European political commentators raised the following question: "What exactly is Hitler's intention? Is his goal to win the leadership of the country (the presidency), the leadership of the government (the premiership), or does he want both?" Now, although Hitler's campaign for the presidency failed, he achieved a major victory in the Prussian state election. Therefore, has Hitler's political activity, in losing in the east, gained in the west? It cannot be said for certain. The result of this Prussian state election is that the National Socialist Party has jumped to one hundred and sixty-two seats, but it has not obtained an absolute majority. The parties supporting Prussian Prime Minister Otto Braun hold a similar number of seats as the National Socialist Party. Therefore, after Braun resigns, it is still unknown who will win the Prussian political power. The Communist Party is the only party that can significantly influence the power struggle. The Communist Party now holds fifty-seven seats. If it is willing to abstain from voting, it could help Hitler seize the political power of Prussia. Otherwise, Braun could unite the Social Democratic Party and the Centre Party and remain the prime minister of the Prussian government. However, in any case, the authority of the Prussian government will inevitably be greatly reduced by the constraints of the National Socialist Party. Therefore, if Hitler retreats, he can restrain the government of Prussia and make it struggle. If he advances, he can seize the political power of Prussia and compete with Federal Chancellor Brüning, striving to make Brüning uneasy in his position and force the dissolution of the Federal Parliament. Yesterday, German Social Democrat Breitscheid lamented, "After the election results are announced, Prussia will no longer be the center of democratic progress in the German Federation." It can be seen that Hitler will henceforth use Prussia to influence all of Germany, and his political career will increasingly follow in the footsteps of Mussolini.</p>
<p>The party led by Hitler is an extreme nationalist group that is anti-communist and anti-Semitic. Its political program is similar to that of the Italian Fascists. The rise of this extreme right-wing force is the result of the current situation in Germany. Political commentator Bertholdy said, "Political instability will inevitably provoke reactionary forces to rise up." History has shown us that whenever a country faces a major political crisis, it tends towards dictatorship. The victory of the Bolsheviks in Russia, the success of the Fascists in Italy, the once dictatorial rule of Rivera in Spain, and the re-seizure of power by Piłsudski in Poland are all powerful proofs of this political law. Since the Great War, Germany has been oppressed by treaties, burdened by heavy reparations, and has experienced economic bankruptcy and increased unemployment, leading to social unrest and political instability. All of these factors have contributed to the expansion of Hitler's power. Those who pay attention to political theory should not ignore Hitler's activism as a temporary disruption, based on the principle that economics can influence politics.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Results of the League of Nations Secret Meeting <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Hoping that Japan will accept the British Ambassador's Plan</p>
<p>The Special Committee is scheduled to reopen its meeting today.</p>
<p>Will not specify a complete withdrawal date</p>
<p>Only state the phrase "in the near future"</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 26th - The Special Committee of Nineteen Nations met tonight for about an hour. The representatives remained silent about the content of the meeting and only issued the following communiqué to the press: "The Special Committee of the League of Nations held a closed meeting at 3:30 p.m. The Chairman reported on his talks with the Chinese and Japanese representatives. The Special Committee has learned that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Miles Lampson, has submitted a new proposal to the Chinese government that appears sufficient to bring the two governments to an agreement. The Japanese government is still considering it, but will make a decision soon. In this situation, the Special Committee believes it is necessary to wait for the Japanese government's decision. The Special Committee will reconvene this Thursday and intends to hold a public meeting at the end of this week." It is heard that Chairman Hymans reported in detail at the meeting on his informal talks with various parties and his efforts to find a solution that would be acceptable to both sides. He said that the goal has not yet been achieved and that efforts must continue. It is widely believed that the compromise plan for Shanghai is very important in today's meeting. The Special Committee hopes that the Shanghai conference can be concluded so that the Special Committee can reconvene in the near future to plan the second step. If the two sides in Shanghai fail to agree, the Special Committee will hold a public meeting to report on the progress and convene a plenary session.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 26th - After the Nineteen-Nation Committee met this afternoon, Chairman Hymans reported on his talks with the Chinese and Japanese representatives, saying that he hoped Japan would accept the new formula proposed by British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson. The Committee will meet again on Thursday to discuss whether to hold a public meeting before the end of this week. It is heard that the representatives of the small countries insisted that the League of Nations Assembly must reopen on Monday. As for the so-called new compromise formula, it is heard that it is a modification of item four of the original draft, allowing the Mixed Commission to supervise and report on the progress of the Japanese troop withdrawal, but not one-third of the complete withdrawal date, only stating the phrase "in the near future". If this compromise plan is accepted, item eleven of the draft will be deleted. Today's closed meeting started at 3:50 p.m. and ended at 5:07 p.m.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 26th - The closed meeting of the Nineteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Assembly was delayed until 3:50 p.m. this afternoon. It is heard that the discussion focused on the nature and interpretation of the draft resolution.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Geneva, 26th - According to informal supplementary news, the Nineteen-Nation Committee seemed to have exchanged views on the proposal of certain members regarding the formal notification of the Manchurian government about the League of Nations Investigation Team's trip to Manchuria, but it seems that no sanctions were imposed today. In addition, regarding the Shanghai conference, it is heard that the Nineteen-Nation Committee has considerable reason to believe that British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson's proposal is expected to be accepted quickly. With this proposal, the negotiations can be concluded. In fact, Sir Miles' mediation plan seemed to have received the informal agreement of the Japanese Ambassador to China before it was submitted to Nanjing. Now it is only waiting for the formal response from the Chinese government. The Nineteen-Nation Committee decided to wait for this response until Thursday. If both sides accept Sir Miles' plan, the resolution of the Nineteen-Nation Committee will be revised. Item eleven of the resolution passed by the Nineteen-Nation Committee originally stipulated that the Mixed Commission, which was to be established under the conditions of the armistice, could declare the restoration of the original state by a majority vote, and the troops should be withdrawn. If Sir Miles' plan is followed, this provision should be cancelled. Because Article 3 of Sir Miles' plan only stipulates that if there is a failure to comply with the terms of the armistice, the Mixed Commission may remind both parties of their obligations, which is clearly different from the aforementioned Article 11. When Sir Miles proposed the new plan, he had obtained the consent of the ambassadors of the relevant powers in Shanghai. People in Geneva seem to believe that Tokyo will respond with agreement to Sir Miles' proposal. - Japan News Agency, Geneva, 26th - At 10:00 p.m. tonight, the Japanese delegation received instructions from the Japanese government stating that Sir Miles Lampson's compromise plan should be inserted into item eleven of the Committee's resolution. Ambassador Nagaoka immediately notified the Committee by telephone. The League of Nations authorities hope to resolve this issue as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 27th - The news that China and Japan have accepted Sir Miles Lampson's new plan has dispelled the gloom, and the obstacles to the draft of the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations can also be eliminated. The small countries that were prepared to demand that neutral countries have the right to specify the date of the Japanese military withdrawal in some way are now also happy to accept the new plan as the final test of Japan's sincerity. One of the most hard-line small countries, its representative, said to a Reuters interviewer today, "If the Sino-Japanese dispute is mediated by the League of Nations for a long time, then intervention to satisfy both China and Japan is not our business. If Japan can respect the spirit of the treaty, then a happy ending is possible."</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 27th - The Japanese government's instruction to Shigemitsu Aoi to accept the new plan set by Sir Miles Lampson has been welcomed by well-informed circles here, who say that the easing of the situation in the Far East can be further advanced. However, they still have concerns about Manchuria. It is widely believed that the situation there is becoming increasingly precarious, and that the Japanese military's suppression of the Manchurian unrest is more likely to lead to a war with Russia. The Manchester Guardian published an editorial today stating that although the powers have not publicly denied the League of Nations Charter, they have opposed its implementation, leading the League of Nations to be despised and manipulated by Japanese militarists. Japan has shown with its attitude that today's world can still be invaded by imperialists with impunity. From various points of view, this is a sad thing.</p>

<p>The Drafting Committee Held a Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese armistice and troop withdrawal conference fell into a stalemate, the representatives of both sides have not met for many days. Now, through the efforts of British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson, the Chinese government has accepted Sir Miles' compromise plan, and the Sino-Japanese situation is once again trending towards reconciliation. Starting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the Chinese and Japanese sides, together with the representatives of neutral countries, organized the clauses of the previous draft proposals at the British Embassy, and the general assembly is expected to reopen soon. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e4">Two Meetings Yesterday <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, the Chinese and Japanese sides held a drafting committee meeting. The Chinese side was represented by Zhang Sixu, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Japanese side was represented by Okazaki Katsuo, Second Secretary of the Embassy. The neutral countries were represented by Techman, Chinese Secretary of the British Embassy. The meeting adjourned at 11:10 a.m. In the afternoon, the discussion continued from 3:30 p.m. to 4:45 p.m. According to Director Zhang, the committee was responsible for organizing the clauses discussed in the previous sessions. Except for the two issues of troop withdrawal and time, which have not been resolved, all other clauses have been organized. These clauses include the five articles of the armistice agreement and the four annexes that have been discussed. The committee is only responsible for organizing them and has no right to modify them.</p>

<p>At 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Dai Ji, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, and Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army, went to Guo Wai-ci's residence in the same car to discuss the future of the Sino-Japanese armistice conference. After about an hour, Dai and Huang left. At 11:30 a.m., Mayor Wu Tiecheng also went to Guo's residence to confer for half an hour before returning to his residence.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Japanese Side Accepts the Proposal <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the compromise plan proposed by the British Ambassador, the Chinese side reluctantly accepted it out of the goodwill of a friendly country. At 11:00 a.m. yesterday, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu also visited British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson at the British Consulate for ten minutes before leaving. It is understood that Shigemitsu's visit to the British Ambassador was to notify the Japanese government that it had accepted the British Ambassador's compromise plan and that there were no other contacts.</p>
<h3 id="e7">The British Ambassador Mediates with All Parties <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>British Ambassador Sir Miles Lampson actively mediated in Beijing a few days ago and has now achieved results. After returning to Shanghai the day before yesterday morning, he immediately met with the ambassadors of various friendly countries. The day before yesterday evening, he went to the US Ambassador's residence for dinner and had a long discussion on the Sino-Japanese case. At 11:05 a.m. yesterday morning, French Ambassador Wilden also visited the British Ambassador, but the French Ambassador left hastily after only three minutes. At 11:30 a.m., Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano also visited the British Ambassador and talked for a quarter of an hour before leaving. It is said that after the British Ambassador met with the Chinese and Japanese sides and the representatives of various countries for several days, the reopening of the armistice conference is becoming more and more hopeful.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Content of the Compromise Plan <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The compromise plan of the British Ambassador is based on the content of the eleventh item of the draft resolution passed by the League of Nations Nineteen-Nation Committee. The eleventh item of the League of Nations resolution originally stipulated that once the situation permits, any party of the Mixed Commission may propose the withdrawal of Japanese troops. After the majority of the commissioners pass it, the Japanese troops must withdraw. The Japanese side strongly opposed this draft, so the League of Nations failed to pass it. Now the British Ambassador has removed any party from this clause and has restored the spirit of the first, second, and third items of the troop withdrawal agreement before January 28. Regarding the Japanese troop withdrawal, because the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that the number of troops is too large to be completely withdrawn immediately, the compromise plan also allows the Japanese troops to temporarily station in the concession and the Kunlian area. However, the British Ambassador has completely deleted the Japanese declaration containing political elements, which is the statement that our side most opposes. The plan also clearly states that if the Japanese troops do not withdraw one day, the spirit of the League of Nations resolution will not be implemented for one day. Our side is not satisfied with the British Ambassador's compromise plan because it does not have a clear date for the Japanese troop withdrawal. However, because it does not involve political issues, it is reluctantly accepted.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Waiting for the League of Nations Resolution <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it has not yet been decided when the Shanghai conference will reopen. It must wait until the public meeting of the League of Nations is held and the formal proposal is passed before the Shanghai conference can continue. The purpose of the government's submission to the League of Nations this time is not only to request a clear interpretation of the resolution of March 4, but also to request a guarantee of the implementation of this resolution. Although the League of Nations has made a draft, it has not yet been formally passed. Therefore, our side must wait for the League of Nations to decide on the draft in the public meeting and turn it into a resolution before our government can instruct the Shanghai side to continue negotiations according to the spirit of the new resolution. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also said that the new draft resolution of the League of Nations believes that if the Japanese troops do not withdraw one day, then the Japanese side has not been notified of the League of Nations resolution for one day. China and any party can report to the League of Nations at any time.</p>
<p>Mass organizations oppose - The United Federation of Mass Organizations of this city held a standing committee meeting yesterday morning. Zhang Juansheng, Shen Zuru, Wang Baozhen, and Wang Zhisheng were present. Wang Baozhen was elected chairman and recorded the minutes. Zhang Juansheng (brief report) decided on the following major cases: 1. Telegraph to all provinces and cities to establish national salvation organizations and send representatives to participate in the National United Federation of National Salvation Organizations. 2. Initiate the organization of a preparatory committee for the memorial service for the anti-Japanese martyrs. 3. Send a telegram to oppose the government's acceptance of the British Ambassador's compromise plan. 4. Organize a preparatory committee for the May 9th National Humiliation Memorial Day. The telegram of the association opposing the government's acceptance of the British Ambassador's compromise plan is recorded as follows: To the Nanjing National Government: The provisions of Article 11 of the new draft of the League of Nations Special Committee authorize the Mixed Commission to hold the resolution of the League of Nations to withdraw Japanese troops. Our country has lost the grasp of restoring Songhu. The government telegraphed to accept and repeatedly conceded. The people's indignation is difficult to suppress. It is heard that the British Ambassador has proposed a new method because the Japanese are resolutely opposed to it, and the power of the Mixed Committee to decide by a majority vote is also deleted. It is no different from reserving opportunities for the Japanese to take the opportunity to station troops permanently and forcibly occupy the gateway to my Jianghai. News reports that the government dared to accept it, so that the majority of the nineteen committee countries who sympathize with us will be sacrificed, and the national people's hope for the government will be completely despaired. I hope to change the plan as soon as possible and recover the lost land by force, so as to defend against insults and appease the people's anger. Shanghai United Federation of Mass Organizations</p>
<p>Opinions from Nanjing - A special telegram from Nanjing on the 27th said that the round table conference may not be held, and all aftermath issues will be handled by the Mixed Commission. Japan has expressed its refusal to the League of Nations' coercive treatment, but has slightly indicated its acceptance of the British Ambassador's mediation plan, leaving only textual revisions. Today, European and American people here believe that the armistice agreement can be signed soon, and its content is extremely equal and does not harm China's national rights, because it does not include political conditions. It is also said that the stalemate in the Shanghai case has not had a significant impact on the surface, but the indirect losses to the national economy and people's livelihood are very large. It is hoped that those who are not responsible will not over-supervise the authorities, so that the chaos in the papers can come to an end.</p>

<p>A special telegram from Kunshan on the 27th said that there were fifty or sixty Japanese soldiers stationed in Luojia Village, west of Huangdu, forcing residents to supply them. The enemy instructed traitors to organize a self-defense group in Fuqiao and appointed Ba Junqing and Gao Xuanyong as the commander and Xi Peiyang and Xi Zhen as the deputy commanders.</p>
<p>A special telegram from Suzhou on the 27th said that the enemy set up a pseudo-trial and detention center in Xintang City, which was evacuated on the afternoon of the 26th. There are only forty or fifty troops stationed there now. There are no large Japanese troops in Yuewang City, Xintang City, and Pailou City. Only sentries appear and disappear. The enemy headquarters in Liuhe has moved to Zhabei to handle affairs. Recently, all the enemy scouts in Liuhe are traitors. All the Japanese warships outside the mouth of Liuhe have been completely transferred to Shanghai. There are only three or four hundred enemies in Liuhe. Japanese soldiers come and go frequently in the small vegetable market area of Zhabei.</p>

<p>More than 30 Million Compatriots in the Three Northeastern Provinces</p>
<p>Half a Year of Famine Within a Year</p>
<p>The Mainland News reported that a person who came to Shanghai from Harbin yesterday stated that if the three northeastern provinces are under the control of the Japanese warlords for a long time, then more than 30 million Chinese people will have half a year of famine within a year. At present, farmers have their fields taken away, workers have lost their jobs, schools have been turned into military camps, and shops are used as places to sell cigarettes and gamble. Korean immigrants come to Manchuria in thousands, relying on Japanese soldiers as support, occupying the fields of Chinese farmers to grow rice, and seizing the houses and shops of Chinese people, and doing all kinds of illegal things. At present, the Korean registration office is specially set up in the Korean Consulate in Heilongjiang Provincial City to provide various conveniences to the Koreans who settle in Qiqihar and northern Manchuria to encourage them. All Chinese banks and shops in Manchuria must have their accounts checked by Japanese accountants. If it is found that there is a share capital of former officials of the three provinces, the shops will be closed and their property will be confiscated by the Japanese army. Now the Japanese are also planning railway aggression and will change all the railways owned by the Chinese government in the three provinces into branches of the South Manchuria Railway. Although the South Manchuria Railway ends in Changchun, now Harbin, Qiqihar, Taonan, and other major stations of the Chinese government's railway bureau all have South Manchuria Railway branches.</p>

She has been unanimously elected as a member of the Preparatory Committee and the Executive Committee of the conference, and is requested to represent China at the conference. There are many famous members of various countries on the Preparatory Committee, and the great Russian writer Gorky is also one of them. Ms. Song replied that she was willing to serve as a member of the Central Executive Committee of the conference. As for whether she can represent China at the conference, it depends entirely on the survival of Mr. and Mrs. Niu Lan.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Establishment Today of <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee initiated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government will hold its inaugural meeting today. The nature and reasons for the establishment of the committee are explained in detail in the letter of appointment for the committee members, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter of Appointment for Committee Members - Letter No. 444 issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Government to the members of the Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee stated: Since the aggressive neighbor caused the Shanghai case, our country's army has relied on the army to resist to the death. The Songhu area fought hard in the front, and Jiatai and other counties defended firmly in the rear. After a long stalemate, the defense line has become longer and longer, extending to Kunshan and Changshu, and sentries can be heard everywhere. The most severely affected are the famous cities and bustling markets, which have suffered the same devastation. The majestic buildings and carved walls have been reduced to ruins, and the injured are lying on top of each other. Families have been destroyed. Secondly, the sound of the wind and cranes has been alarming every night, and it is too late to escape. All industries have been abandoned. In addition, the army has been traveling, transporting forage and grain, and rescuing the dead and the wounded. The supply has not stopped, and the materials have been exhausted. In total, tens of thousands of our Jiangsu compatriots have died in the disaster, and more than one million have been displaced and their livelihoods have been destroyed. All cultural and production undertakings have suffered direct and indirect damage that is difficult to enumerate. I am in the same position as you, bearing heavy responsibilities and facing difficult times. When the peasants are looking up to the sky, and I see Zheng Xia's picture of refugees, I am filled with devastation. I often hear the calls of the Geng Kui, and the four suburbs are uncertain about the beacon. The responsibility lies in me, and it is difficult to sleep and eat. I am pacing around the room and don't know what to do. I am thinking about saving the people from the brink of death, with the same feelings of being hungry and drowning. It is not a one-handed effort to support the building that is about to collapse. At this time, the disaster area is vast and the devastation is deep. Only by exhausting the talents of officials and people can we work together to save the chaos and save the country. If the suffering of the people is reduced by one point, it will be a continuation of life for Jiangsu. I dare not expect the results, and I only hope to do my best. It is intended to organize the Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee, with the intention of mutual assistance between officials and people, and public and private maintenance, and to engage in the planning and restoration of reconstruction in the spirit of working together, so that the survivors of the disaster can live and gather in peace. I have long admired your words and expressions, and your hometown feelings are heavy. The enthusiasm and strength of your compatriots are well-known. This is the decision of the 489th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee to appoint you as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee. I hope that you will be mindful of the difficult times and generously agree to take on the task. I will gather my talents and work together to implement the plan.</p>
<p>Telegram for the Meeting - A telegram to the members also stated: When the national army resists the enemy, Jiangsu is bearing the brunt of the disaster. In addition to military affairs, the disaster is serious. Although the national crisis has not yet ended, relief cannot be delayed. The Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee has been established, and you have been appointed as a member. The inaugural meeting will be held in Zhenjiang on April 28. Please be sure to attend the meeting on time and work together to implement the plan. In addition to the letter of appointment, I would like to inform you of this by telegram. I look forward to your reply. Sincerely, Gu Zhutong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government.</p>

The dependents of Teng had previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Military Affairs to allocate pension funds, which had not been approved. It is now heard that Madam Yang Peiyao, the wife of Teng, along with her relatives Zhang Deming and her children, took the Jiang'an wheel of the China Merchants Bureau to Beijing at 3:00 p.m. yesterday to personally request the Ministry of Military Affairs to issue the pension funds to meet their urgent needs. It is also heard that after receiving the pension funds, they will set off to return to their original home in Guizhou.</p>

<p>General Zhu Ziqiao, Director of the Working Group of the National Government's Flood Relief Committee, recently went to Beijing to negotiate with the authorities regarding the transportation of relief wheat to Anhui and the allocation of additional relief taxes.  Having completed his official duties, he arrived in Shanghai on the Yiyi Company's Lianhe steamboat at 12:30 PM yesterday.  It is reported that the relief wheat being transported to Anhui can only be transported to Pukou due to a shortage of vehicles on the Jinpu Railway, and cannot be transported into Anhui Province. Mr. Zhu specifically requested the Ministry of Railways to order the Jinpu Railway Bureau to provide a special train to transport relief wheat from Pukou to northern Anhui in order to save those suffering from the disaster. He also requested that the railway surcharge for relief be allocated as soon as possible.  The results of the negotiations were extremely satisfactory, and it was agreed to handle the wheat transportation as requested, and to telegraph each railway bureau to quickly remit the surcharges for allocation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Xi Dejiong, Director of the Work Relief Office of the same committee, went to Hankou to inspect the dyke work and work relief projects along the Yangtze River. Having completed his work, he returned to Shanghai on the same ship as Director Zhu yesterday.</p>

However, it is urgently impossible to raise the funds. If funds are not available on the twenty-eighth, the situation will be extremely critical.

<p>Anti-Japanese National Salvation Program</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Members' Self-Salvation Association held an extraordinary emergency meeting yesterday. All members present discussed Mr. Sun Ke's anti-Japanese national salvation program and decided to lead all comrades in the city in issuing the following circular telegram: "The Northeast has fallen for half a year, and the retreat from Shanghai has also lasted for several months. Our authorities have consistently endured humiliation and sought complete peace, hoping to maintain world peace in the slightest. The violent sun has instead become more unscrupulous, taking advantage of the weak. Although the friendly nations have tried their best to mediate, their ambition cannot be stopped. The only plan for now is to reorganize our forces and continue to resist. It is especially important to resolve the divisions between the government and the people and unite to overcome the national crisis. Recently, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, the revolutionary leader of our party, could not bear the endless internal and external troubles and specifically announced the current anti-Japanese national salvation program, advocating that anti-Japanese national salvation be the goal and the promotion of constitutional government be the method. It is hoped that the party can lead the people and the people can trust the government. All the basic principles for future political, diplomatic, and party affairs reforms are the only way out for the party and the country. At this time of national crisis, this excellent plan for national salvation has brought joy to all people. In addition to submitting the program to the central government for prompt adoption, we also express our support to the people of the whole country to rise up and respond, and promote its early realization to rebuild the party and the country. I pledge to lead all my comrades to dedicate our lives to the cause."</p>

<h3 id="e24">Committee Member of the Booksellers' Association Discusses the Truth About Increased Book Postage <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Booksellers' Association has repeatedly telegraphed the government to withdraw the order to increase postage for books, as the book industry opposes the post office's price increase for mailing books. A committee member gave the following statement: "When the post office was first established during the late Qing Dynasty, postage rates for books were uniform throughout the country, unlike parcels, which had different rates for different zones. This shows that the autocratic government and its foreign advisors at the time recognized the need for books to reach remote areas because of transportation difficulties. During the Xinhai Revolution, Sun Yat-sen, as the provisional president of Nanjing, issued a clear order for post offices to reduce postage rates for books and newspapers by half in order to promote education and culture. In the eleventh year of the Republic, Gao Enhong, the Minister of Communications, wanted to increase postage rates to fund foreign loans. However, this was opposed by members of parliament, provincial governors, business and industry leaders, and education bureaus, and the proposal was ultimately cancelled in its entirety. However, even then, they did not dare to cancel the half-rate for books and restore the old rates from the late Qing Dynasty. The current era of political tutelage is different from the warlord era. The government should seek the development of education and culture, and should pay particular attention to the development of the western regions. It should not hinder the progress of education and culture in the western provinces. Furthermore, reducing postage rates for books and newspapers was one of Sun Yat-sen's good policies, and members of the Kuomintang should uphold it and not emulate the warlords, or even surpass them." The details of the increase in postage rates for books may not be clear to all sectors. I will now list the rates for sending two kilograms of books from Shanghai as an example: (A) Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shandong, Henan (same as before, 15 cents); (B) The three northeastern provinces (temporarily same as before, 15 cents); (C) Japan, including Korea, Ryukyu, Taiwan, and the southern half of Sakhalin (same as before, 15 cents); (D) Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Hunan, Hubei (those directly accessible by ship or train are the same as before, 15 cents; those with partial access are doubled, i.e., 30 cents); (E) Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou (Shaanxi's Tongguan area and the Chongqing area of Sichuan are doubled, i.e., 30 cents; all other areas are tripled, i.e., 45 cents). One kilogram is approximately equal to slightly more than two pounds. Let me ask, what is the actual price of a book weighing two to four pounds? (Ordinary books are actually worth 20-30 cents per pound, while more expensive ones are worth no more than 40-50 cents). The postage has increased from 15 cents to 45 cents. If single registered mail is required, an additional 10 cents is required; double registered mail requires an additional 20 cents. Assuming that 20 copies of a common textbook are purchased by mail at 3 cents with a 10% discount, i.e., 54 cents, the single registered postage would cost 25 cents, which is double the value. The level of education and culture in the western provinces is still very low. Now, using postage rates to control their lifeline, I do not know what the intention is. It is also difficult to distinguish whether inland areas are accessible by rail or not. Under this approach, there will be many disputes. For example, sending a book from Shandong to Hangzhou only requires a single postage rate, but sending it to Haining would require double the rate. Similarly, sending a book from Beiping to Nanjing only requires a single postage rate, but sending it to Nanyang Mountain would require double the rate. However, the three northeastern provinces are not charged extra, and Japan is not charged extra. This kind of matter concerning national policy should not be left to the Ministry of Communications to do as it pleases."</p>

<p>Britain and the United States Strive to Reconcile German and French Opinions</p>
<p>Tardieu Rushes to Geneva Tonight</p>
<p>Geneva, 26th (National News Agency dispatch) The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference met today and resolved to suspend meetings pending the completion of a report by the Technical Committee defining which land, sea, and air forces' weapons are offensive and which are defensive. However, although the Steering Committee only intended to suspend the meeting for two weeks yesterday, it appears likely that the meeting will be postponed indefinitely given the current situation. According to the French delegation, the Technical Committee will need at least five weeks to prepare its report, and the General Committee has already resolved to take a holiday for Pentecost from May 13 to 17, indicating that it is not prepared to continue the meeting until the political issues hindering current progress have been resolved. This morning, key figures from Britain, the United States, France, and Germany met at the Beau Rivage Hotel from 10:30 am to 12:30 pm. British Prime Minister MacDonald, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, and German Chancellor Brüning have all decided to remain in Geneva, awaiting French Prime Minister Tardieu's return from France on Friday for further discussions, in the hope that a Franco-German compromise path can be prepared by then to achieve some progress on disarmament. This morning's meeting of key figures at the Beau Rivage Hotel was initiated by MacDonald, with the intention of having Tardieu and Brüning, under British and American mediation, sincerely and confidentially discuss and reconcile their respective positions on the four-nation conference to be held on Friday. However, it is reported that today's talks focused mainly on key British and German figures. According to reliable sources, although Brüning and German Foreign Minister Pülow were also tasked with exploring the attitudes of various countries toward the German National Socialist Party leader Hitler taking power in the future, the talks focused on the relationship between disarmament and the overall European political situation. Afterward, the gist of the talks was notified to Foreign Minister Grandi.</p>
<p>London, 26th (National News Agency dispatch) British Foreign Secretary Simon departed for Geneva at 2 pm this afternoon.</p>
<p>Paris, 27th (National News Agency dispatch) The sudden decision by French Prime Minister Tardieu this morning to travel to Geneva tomorrow night was prompted by a long telephone conversation with Stimson. It is now expected that Stimson will play an important role in the informal meeting of British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Minister Grandi, German Chancellor Brüning, and French Prime Minister Tardieu on Friday morning. However, after going to Geneva, Tardieu will still return to France on Friday night and go directly to Belfort to conclude his election campaign. If all goes well in Geneva at that time, he will make an important speech on Franco-German relations.</p>
<p>Paris, 27th (National News Agency dispatch) French Prime Minister Tardieu has canceled his speech in Belfort on Thursday due to laryngitis, as advised by his doctor. However, it is reported that unless his condition changes unexpectedly, he will still travel to Geneva on Friday.</p>

Sirianni also stated that the Italian government's decision should not be seen as Italy having abandoned its naval equality advocated in London and other places, or allowing any other country to gain a superior position as a result.</p>

<p>Britain's Attitude Depends on French Concessions</p>
<p>United States Does Not Formally Participate in Discussions</p>
<p>Geneva, 26th (National News Agency dispatch) Important talks and meetings have continued here in recent days, and preparations for the Lausanne Reparations Conference are one of the main issues in the talks and meetings. This morning, German Chancellor Brüning met with U.S. Secretary of State Stimson for two hours. In the afternoon, Brüning had a long conversation with British Prime Minister MacDonald. According to reliable sources, these talks have clarified the chaotic situation, and the attitudes of the various countries have been clearly expressed. Germany will strive to argue that it is currently unable to pay reparations. The current global economic panic is largely due to the payment of reparations and war debts. To achieve global recovery, the issue of reparations and war debts must be effectively resolved. France advocates temporary transitional measures, or a further extension of the suspension period by two years, but unconditional reparations must still be dealt with now. Italy supports Germany's proposal, believing that the time to cancel reparations and war debts has arrived. Britain supports France's attitude, believing that the time for a practical solution has not yet matured, but the suspension period can be more generous than France has conceded, and it advocates an unconditional suspension, with all reparations and war debts suspended. The United States has not formally participated in the discussions, but it is reported that it also supports Britain's proposal.</p>

<p>New York, 26th (National News Agency dispatch) The Radio Corporation of America today clarified the resumption of communication between the Shenyang and San Francisco radio stations. The company has not signed a formal contract with the Manchurian puppet government, nor does it have any formal diplomatic significance. The resumption of communication is only a verbal understanding, and in fact, it is merely a continuation of the contract that the company had with the former Northeastern authorities. The claim that the puppet government officials in Shenyang and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Castle exchanged congratulatory telegrams at the beginning of communication is also completely false. It is claimed that Castle and other U.S. government officials were not aware of this matter. Since the U.S. government has not recognized the Manchurian government, how could it be possible to exchange congratulatory telegrams?</p>

<h3 id="e99">Wang Jingwei Reports on Diplomacy and Internal Affairs <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Ceasefire Conference Awaits League of Nations Instructions to Proceed</p>
<p>A Detailed and Eloquent Account of the National Crisis Conference</p>
<p>And a Vigorous Rebuttal of Those Dissatisfied with Tutelage</p>
<p>Because Without the Kuomintang, There Would Be No Republic of China</p>
<p>Kuomintang Central Standing Committee member Wang Jingwei delivered the following major report at the morning memorial week meeting on the 25th: "The events of this week that can be reported concern diplomacy and politics. On the diplomatic front, although the Shanghai ceasefire conference has stalled, it has not broken down. We are now waiting for the League of Nations Special Committee to reach a resolution before considering further action. As for the League of Nations investigation team, it has now arrived in the Northeast. Previously, the Manchurian puppet government refused to allow our country's representative to enter the Northeast, but now our country's representative, acting on government instructions, has arrived in the Northeast with the investigation team. They have now begun their investigation and plan to send their first report to the League of Nations around May 1st. On the political front, I would like to report on a few points today. First, the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee resolved to establish people's representative organs at all levels. The Central Political Council resolved to submit this to the Executive Yuan for deliberation and handling. The Executive Yuan has therefore held several meetings. Last Saturday, it held a detailed discussion and reached a general resolution. Originally, there were several types of people's representative organs at the city, county, and provincial levels. Now, it has been decided to start with the city-level people's representative organs. A draft has been prepared, and after further meetings and slight revisions this week, it can be passed and sent to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The draft does not focus on the articles themselves, but on determining the procedures for preparation. It is proposed to start in May, with a three-month period to complete several important tasks of municipal autonomy. Then, within two months, a municipal council will be convened. Cities are now divided into three types: those directly under the National Government, such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Qingdao; ordinary cities, such as Guangzhou; and cities that have been named but not established. They are all relatively easy to concentrate in various parts of the country, so local autonomy will start with the cities, which will be easier to implement. In the future, after the Executive Yuan approves the draft, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan and published for the attention and discussion of comrades and all sectors of society. Second, regarding the National Crisis Conference, there were three proposals at the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee in December last year: the National Crisis Conference, the National Salvation Association, and the National Representative Assembly. At that time, it was decided to convene the National Crisis Conference and to limit its discussion to the three areas of resisting aggression, pacifying the country, and providing relief. The National Salvation Association and the National Representative Assembly were submitted to the Central Standing Committee for deliberation. The members of the National Crisis Conference were appointed by the government, while the members of the National Salvation Association and the National Representative Assembly were elected by the people. Their natures were different, and their powers were also different. Before the National Crisis Conference convened, several members requested that political issues be discussed in addition to the three areas of resisting aggression, disaster relief, and pacifying the country. I replied that the scope of the National Crisis Conference was determined by the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee and submitted by the National Government to the Executive Yuan. Although issues outside these three areas could be freely discussed, the Executive Yuan had no power to respond. However, the members from Beiping and Shanghai spoke of the government restricting the scope of discussion. I believed that the facts were present and that there was no need to respond. Later, the National Crisis Conference convened in Luoyang. In addition to the issues of resisting aggression, disaster relief, and pacifying the country, there were also political proposals, especially regarding the issues of tutelage and constitutional government, with various opinions. Taking the two extremes, one was to end tutelage immediately and implement constitutional government, and before the implementation of constitutional government, to reorganize the nature of the government so that it would not be a government of the Kuomintang ruling the country with the party. The other was that the National Crisis Conference should not discuss the issues of tutelage and constitutional government. These issues should be resolved by the Kuomintang's Fifth National Congress. Between these two extreme opinions, there were many different views. Therefore, the proposal review committee first objectively analyzed and organized the various proposals, listed the same points, and reported them to the public. After a day of heated discussion at the conference, the review committee reported its own subjective judgment. What they supported was: first, to ask the government to end tutelage as scheduled, convene a National Assembly, and draft a constitution; second, before the National Assembly, to convene a National Representative Assembly, whose powers would be to deliberate on budgets and final accounts, domestic and foreign public debts, and important international treaties. This proposal was approved by four-fifths of the members present. This proposal was jointly signed by professors from various universities in Wuhan and Beiping. Some of them were members of the party, and some were not. It can be seen that it did not come from the will of one party. After the proposal was passed, I stated that as the President of the Executive Yuan, I could not guarantee that it would be adopted, and even as a member of the Central Committee, I did not have the power to do so. However, I would definitely bring this proposal to the Central Committee and request that the Central Committee decide to adopt it. Thus, it can be seen that their claim that the presentation of issues outside of the three areas of resisting aggression, disaster relief, and pacifying the country was prohibited is completely unfounded. As for now, they say that the members of the National Crisis Conference are mostly composed of officials and party members. This is even more contrary to the facts. If we look at the list of members of the National Crisis Conference, there are officials and party members, but there are even more people outside the party. Furthermore, in terms of the proposals of the National Crisis Conference, very few belong to party members, and many belong to people outside the party. It can be seen that their slander is unfounded. This time, when Comrade Luo Jialun returned from Beiping, he told me that some people are saying that Wang Jingwei advocates that party members should not be elected at all to the National Representative Assembly. This statement is completely fabricated out of thin air. Not only have I never said this, but since the representatives of the National Representative Assembly are elected by the people, what does it have to do with whether they are party members or not? It can be said that they fabricate rumors out of thin air in every possible way. Last time, the Central Political Council had already designated comrades to draft the draft for popularly elected legislative and supervisory members, and comrades have also been designated to jointly and thoroughly examine the National Salvation Association and the National Representative Assembly. It is likely that there will be results at the meeting this afternoon. I do not know whether it will pass. The above are all factual reports. According to the party constitution, everyone can express their personal opinions as much as possible before various issues are resolved, but after a resolution is reached, it must be followed consistently. This is the basic principle of democratic centralism, and it is what we should implement. Therefore, I have some personal opinions to add. Regarding the issue of tutelage, there are now two arguments. The first is that talking about democratic politics means losing the meaning of tutelage. The second is that talking about democratic politics means that one does not need to talk about tutelage. In my opinion, both of these arguments are wrong. I have said before that we must have self-criticism and self-confidence. The first argument, that talking about democratic politics means losing the meaning of tutelage, means losing self-criticism. The second argument, that talking about democratic politics means that one does not need to talk about tutelage, means losing self-confidence. We know that according to the teachings of the Premier, the most important task of the tutelage period is to cultivate civil rights. Therefore, during the tutelage period, the power of the people is increasing day by day in terms of time and expanding day by day in terms of space. If we think that talking about democratic politics means losing the meaning of tutelage, then we are turning the process of tutelage into a party dictatorship like the Communist Party. This is a complete misunderstanding of the Premier's meaning of tutelage to cultivate civil rights. However, the second argument, that talking about democratic politics means that one does not need to talk about tutelage, is also wrong. Many people outside the party now have this argument. Since the founding of the Republic of China, people outside the party have had this common and consistent proposition. This is to overthrow the Kuomintang. That is why people outside the party united under Yuan Shikai after he became president in the first year of the Republic of China. Why? Because they wanted to overthrow the Kuomintang. Now they all advocate abolishing tutelage. Why do they want to abolish tutelage? It is also to overthrow the Kuomintang. However, the method of overthrowing the Kuomintang in the past was to undermine constitutional government, because the Provisional Constitution and the Constitution at that time were all made by Kuomintang members to restrain Yuan Shikai and consolidate the foundation of the Republic of China. Therefore, to overthrow the Kuomintang, they had to undermine constitutional government. Therefore, in the second year of the Republic of China, they helped Yuan Shikai dissolve the parliament and destroy the constitution. In the sixth year of the Republic of China, they dissolved the parliament again and destroyed the constitution. Their first step was to overthrow the Kuomintang, and the second step was to overthrow the Republic of China, because the Republic of China was created by the Kuomintang. This is the united front of a group of bureaucrats and politicians since the Republic of China. They wanted to overthrow the Kuomintang in the past, and they still want to overthrow the Kuomintang now. However, their slogan in the past was to undermine constitutional government, while their slogan now is to support constitutional government. This is because they want to destroy tutelage in the name of supporting constitutional government. We should recognize this clearly. The Premier devoted himself to the National Revolution for forty years. The laws and constitutions of the past were all made by the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang and the Republic of China have the closest relationship. It can be said that without the Kuomintang, there would be no Republic of China. Just look at the time when the Kuomintang was in exile after the first year of the Republic of China, which was the time when the Republic of China was in turmoil. Now that they want to overthrow the Kuomintang, it is precisely the autumn of crisis for the Republic of China. Without the Kuomintang, the future of tutelage would be unimaginable, and the future of constitutional government would be even more unimaginable. They are now deeply saddened that China still does not have constitutional government, but what is the reason for this? This is because since the founding of the Republic of China, constitutional government has been destroyed by them once, twice, and three times. They also say that the Kuomintang has not done well in recent years, but there are facts that can prove it. In the first year of the Republic of China, the Kuomintang was in Nanjing for only a few months. Was there a full opportunity? From the start of tutelage in the seventeenth or eighteenth year of the Republic of China to the present, there have only been three years. If there were no internal conflicts, it would certainly be possible to do better. However, given the size of China, its vastness, and the complexity of the situation, it is impossible for anyone to completely improve China in one or two years. If we doubt that the path of tutelage is impassable, it is not that we doubt the poor work during the tutelage period, but that we doubt the Premier's advocacy of tutelage. The government has failed to properly assist the people in preparing for autonomy due to various internal conflicts. Therefore, the government has extended tutelage for this reason, which is justified. However, we must not abolish tutelage altogether. Furthermore, why can't we have a National Assembly now? This is because constitutional government has not yet begun. However, the National Representative Assembly is different from the National Assembly. According to the provisions of the Founding Program, the National Representative Assembly can be established before the five branches of government are established. Each county that has completed autonomy can elect one National Representative to participate in the central government. The two words "participate in" are very clear. Therefore, the powers of the National Representative Assembly are different from the powers of the National Assembly. The National Assembly is the highest organ of the state, while the National Representative Assembly is a reflection of democratic forces and an organ of the tutelage period. Many comrades have not yet recognized this point clearly, thinking that the National Representative Assembly is the National Assembly. This is a great oversight. If we understand this point, we can understand the meaning of the National Representative Assembly during the tutelage period. As for the people outside the party, thinking that this would overthrow tutelage, they can be even more enlightened. What I wanted to say today is roughly like this. The first half is a report on the diplomatic and political developments of this week, and the second half is a statement of personal opinions. We hope that during the tutelage period, we will work hard to cultivate civil rights so that tutelage can be completed as soon as possible and constitutional government can begin as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e100">League of Nations Investigation Team Arrives in Dalian from Qinhuangdao <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>When Haiqi Entered Dalian, Japanese Police Conducted Large-Scale Martial Law</p>
<p>Compatriots in the Northeast Eagerly Await the Team to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>On the 21st, the Team Took the South Manchuria Railway Train to Shenyang</p>
<p>A Beiping dispatch reports that the League of Nations investigation team arrived in Qinhuangdao at 10:00 AM on the 20th and then divided into three groups to go to the Northeast. The reporter also boarded the Haiqi warship with our delegation to Dalian. After a day and night in Dalian, I returned to Beiping yesterday. Here is an account of what I saw. The investigation team originally intended to travel by special train on the Beining Railway to investigate on the ground, but Japan refused, so the itinerary was divided into two routes. One route was for the two representatives from the United States and Italy and Secretary-General Haas, who took a special train from Shanhaiguan on the pseudo-Fengshan Railway eastward. The other route was for the chairman of the investigation team, Lytton, our country's representative Gu Weijun, and the two representatives from France and Germany, who took the Haiqi and a Japanese destroyer from Qinhuangdao to Dalian. When the special train arrived in Qinhuangdao at 9:40 AM on the 20th, those who followed the sea route disembarked and boarded the Chinese and Japanese warships. Our Haiqi warship left the port first at 10:25 AM, followed by two Japanese destroyers. After sailing a little further, Lytton went to the observation deck on the deck and chatted with Gu Weijun. At this time, the captain of the Haiqi, Jiang Yusheng, and Bao Yimin, led the entire crew to arrange the rooms and prepare lunch. Lytton stayed in Room 1, and Gu Weijun stayed in Room 2. Around 1:00 PM, the captain led the team members into the restaurant for lunch. After the meal, Lytton took a walk on the entire deck. The weather was clear and calm that day, and the ship sailed very steadily. Lytton did not enter the room until 3:30 PM, feeling slightly unwell and feverish. He was examined by Xie Enzeng, a doctor accompanying our delegation. His temperature was 36 degrees, and he took a small amount of medicine and went to bed. At that time, he personally drafted a telegram to the head of the Japanese civil administration office in Dalian, which was sent by the Haiqi. The general idea was that he felt slightly unwell on the way and would stay on the ship when he arrived in Dalian at night. He asked not to be bothered with hospitality and asked to reply by telegram if it was necessary to disembark. At 7:00 PM, the ship passed Laotie Mountain for dinner, but Lytton did not get up. At 11:00 PM, the ship entered the port of Dalian and docked at Pier 2. Japanese police conducted large-scale martial law, and our Haiqi sailors also armed and boarded the deck to prepare. At that time, dozens of people, including the representatives of Honjo Shigeru and Uchida Kosai, and the head of the Dalian civil administration office, had arrived at the pier to welcome them in advance. In addition, there were more than a dozen Chinese traitors and hooligans who followed them onto the ship and demanded to meet with Lytton. Lytton had already gone to bed, so his interpreter turned them away. At this time, more than a dozen Japanese reporters, all wearing white armbands with the words "News Reporter" written on them, surrounded Gu Weijun and talked to him. That night, except for Chen Liting and Yan Enyou from our delegation and Wu Xiufeng and Piert, secretaries of the investigation team, who stayed at the Yamato Hotel, the rest stayed on the ship. At 7:00 AM on the 21st, the reporter and several members of the delegation went ashore to sightsee. As soon as they disembarked, dozens of our compatriots from the Northeast came to inquire whether the investigation team could uphold justice and recounted the suffering of the people in the Northeast. Not many steps out of the pier, a Japanese man in a suit asked us where we were going. We told him that we were just sightseeing. The Japanese man said that this place was far from the lively streets and that we might not know the way, so he asked us to follow him as a guide. We realized that he intended to monitor us and did not want to argue with him, so we hired a car and followed his guidance. We went through Yamagata-dori to Naniwa-cho and went around once. The Japanese man told us that the names of the main streets of Dalian were taken from the names of Japanese military officers who died in the Russo-Japanese War. We asked him where to buy newspapers, and he led us to the Manchuria Newspaper Office, where we bought several newspapers and returned to the ship. That day, the newspaper used large characters to publish that the pseudo-state intended to use force to prevent Gu Weijun from entering the country and, if necessary, would detain Gu in Pulan District. Someone showed the newspaper to Gu, who ignored it. At 9:00 AM, the Japanese representative Yoshida led Claudel and Hini to the Haiqi to meet with Lytton and Gu Weijun. At this time, Lytton's health had improved slightly. After talking for a short time, Yoshida and others left. At 11:00 AM, the special train on the South Manchuria Railway was ready, and the luggage of the team members was transported to the station by footmen. At 11:20 AM, Lytton and Gu Weijun left the cabin. The captain of the Haiqi presented Lytton with a bouquet of flowers. At 12:30 PM, Yoshida and the representatives from Germany and France arrived at the station. Lytton, Gu Weijun, and the other members of our delegation disembarked and took cars prepared by the Japanese police to the station to take the train north. After the investigation team left the ship, the martial law at the pier was lifted. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Japanese Newspapers Publicize that Britain <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Tacitly Acknowledges the Manchurian Pseudo-State</p>
<p>Because the Pseudo-State Agrees to Repay British Loans</p>
<p>The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reported from its Shenyang correspondent that during the Zhang Xueliang era, due to financial chaos, the interest on the British loans for the Fengshan Railway (i.e., the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan section) was in arrears by several million yuan. Now, in order to achieve smooth foreign relations, the Manchurian state is first reorganizing foreign debt. The Fengtian Provincial Government is currently investigating the amount of unpaid interest on the Fengshan Railway and has ordered the director of the Fengshan Railway Bureau to agree on a payment method for principal and interest with the representative of the British Chinese Corporation, the loan country of the Fengshan Railway. It is scheduled to repay 500,000 yuan per month starting in February and will pay off 1 million yuan for February and March in full by the official silver house and the Border Industry Bank. The British loan group is quite satisfied and views the agreement as tacit British recognition of the establishment of the Manchurian state.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Singapore Vigorously Suppresses Japanese Goods <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Commerce Suffers a Great Blow</p>
<p>The Kobe Nichika Shinpo reports that Singapore was originally a distribution center for products from Southeast Asia. Three years ago, after the dissolution of the Japanese Industrial Association, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry occupied a major force in the area. After the Manchurian Incident broke out, the anti-Japanese movement spread to the area. The Japanese residents repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asking for appropriate countermeasures. The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established in the area and requested recognition from the British colonial authorities. However, since its establishment, wartime disaster insurance has not been underwritten by domestic (Japanese) companies, and the recent rejection of Japanese goods has been particularly fierce. Therefore, our country's commerce has suffered a great blow.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Japanese Goods Imported into China Suddenly Increase <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Especially Large Imports of Cotton Products and Sugar</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reports that the number of our country's goods sent to the interior of China via Qingdao has increased sharply. According to a telegram from the commercial official in Yokohama, the Chinese authorities have recently taken severe measures to crack down on anti-Japanese activities, so Bang Shang (Japanese merchants) have restored their original state in China. Japanese goods that were previously sold to Henan, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Hebei, and Gansu provinces via Tianjin, Hankou, and Shanghai are now being negotiated in Qingdao. The allocation of ships is very active. Among them, cotton products are in the spring demand period, and there are already reservations for goods up to August and September. Since March 1, as many as 15,000 boxes of goods have been imported, and 150,000 catties of refined sugar and red sugar have been imported, which is the largest import in the past years.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Wu Zhongxin's Policy for Governing Anhui <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Anqing dispatch, Anhui Provincial Government Chairman Wu Zhongxin has already taken office a few days ago. Wu's policy for governing Anhui was not specifically announced at first. At 9:00 AM on the 25th, the new provincial government held its first memorial week, and Wu reported four points of his opinions on provincial affairs: (1) Suppressing bandits: Bandits and communists are rampant in Anhui Province. To make the people live and work in peace, we must first stabilize the locality. Although Chief Commander Chen is in charge of the suppression of bandits, the provincial government must do its best to assist. The first step is to effectively reorganize the defense corps of each county. (2) Disaster relief: After the floods last autumn, the land was barren for thousands of miles, and there were people without food, clothing, and shelter everywhere. Every time I think of their pain, I can't help but feel sad. In the future, I will request the National Government's Disaster Relief Committee to implement good methods to benefit the victims. (3) Reorganizing finance: Anhui's finances are extremely depleted. The committee members waited in Anhui for several days before taking over the job, also because there was no way to raise funds. However, it is difficult to start with revenue generation for a while, so we can only start with cost reduction and reduce administrative expenses as much as possible. (4) Cleaning up the administration: Starting with the various departments and offices of the provincial government, but the clerks will still seek to expand. The quality of officials is closely related to the interests of the locality. In the future, the county magistrates of each county must be selected from those who can be honest and have courage. If they are corrupt and pervert the law, they will be severely punished and will not be tolerated. Other measures that are beneficial to the people will also be implemented in order of urgency.

<p>Selling Flower Bridge: Robbery and Assault (Songjiang Correspondence) At Selling Flower Bridge, about ten miles from the northern outskirts of Songjiang, there is a dry goods store opened by Shen Longguan. It has been robbed several times in recent years. Unexpectedly, last night (the 26th), around twelve o'clock, amidst a torrential downpour, more than ten robbers, each wielding pistols and sharp blades, tricked their way into opening the main gate. They forced the owner to hand over his hidden silver. Shen Longguan claimed that it was just a small village shop with meager business. The robbers immediately fired a shot, hitting his right leg, and stabbed him three times. Bleeding profusely, he collapsed to the ground, allowing the robbers to ransack the place and leave triumphantly. Upon inspection, the losses included clothing, jewelry, and about two hundred yuan in cash. The injured owner was carried to the Joseph Hospital for treatment, but his leg bone was broken and had to be amputated. He was then referred to Shanghai Baolong Hospital for radical treatment.</p>
<p>Japanese Plane Crashes and Burns (Taicang Correspondence) Yesterday morning at 9:35 AM, Japanese plane No. 40, which had been flying over Taicang's Great North Gate for reconnaissance, returned at 2:50 PM. After circling the city once, it flew eastward. Unexpectedly, when it reached Xuejiatan, about six miles outside the East Gate of Taicang, the plane suddenly caught fire, emitting thick smoke, and then crashed. The entire plane was destroyed in an instant. The Japanese pilot and two Japanese soldiers were also killed in the crash.</p>
<p>Breakthrough in the Fenshuidun Armory Robbery Case, Key Suspect Arrested (Fengxian Correspondence) Ding Zhiyan, the head of the county police force, received intelligence that Wang Yinchang, the ringleader of the robbery of firearms from the Fenshuidun Public Security Station, was hiding near Dongxin Market in the Fourth District. He immediately acted discreetly and secretly dispatched Special Agent Chief Liu Baoshan, disguised, to capture the suspect. The suspect was apprehended and has already been transferred to the county government. He confessed to the joint robbery. However, the firearms (one Mauser rifle and two other rifles) had already been borrowed by the fugitive Xi Tou Er. The Haiyan Society Case Temporarily Concluded (Wuxi Correspondence) Huang Zhefu, a special commissioner from the Central Party Headquarters, reported that the Wuxi Haiyan Literary Society was suspected of being reactionary. The Wuxi Garrison Command arrested thirteen people, including Wu Wenshan, and sent them to Beijing for interrogation. The Wuxi National Crisis Relief Association argued that those arrested were mostly young male and female students whose ideas might not be entirely orthodox, but whose intentions were not reactionary. They telegraphed Commander Gu of the Garrison Command, requesting a careful interrogation to avoid implicating innocent people. At the same time, fellow villagers in Beijing also worked to clear their names. Commander Gu conducted a thorough interrogation and determined that only Wu Wenshan, Sun Zuyu, Shi Zhaozhou, Hua Yizeng, and Tao Fanggu were more seriously implicated and needed to remain in Beijing for further questioning. The rest were ordered to have their families come to Beijing to provide guarantees and take them back into custody.</p>
<p>Petition to Waive Additional Rent Collection (Wuxi Correspondence) The county government previously received a provincial order to collect two months' rent. At that time, the war in Shanghai was urgent, and local military needs were dire. The county government convened a temporary meeting with various organizations and decided to follow the precedent of 1927, initially collecting one month's rent from urban shops with monthly rents above five yuan, specifically for local emergency needs. The National Crisis Relief Association and the Chamber of Commerce jointly urged the business community to cooperate, which barely managed to achieve the goal. The collected amount was less than 40,000 yuan. Recently, the county government received another telegram from the province, strictly ordering a change to the original plan, with the county Public Security Bureau investigating and collecting from all shops and households, starting from two yuan, for another month. The county government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to begin investigations. Merchants and residents feel that in the current climate of economic depression, having just paid one month's rent, another round of collection would be beyond their means, leading to widespread opposition. Yesterday, the National Crisis Relief Association submitted a petition to the county government, stating the people's hardship and earnestly requesting a waiver.</p>
<p>Business Community Expresses Views on Business Tax (Nantong Correspondence) The Nantong business community, concerned about the self-collection of business tax by the tax bureau this year, convened a general meeting of members through the Chamber of Commerce and resolved on six measures: (1) Petitioning party and government agencies to negotiate with the business tax bureau for a delay in investigation; (2) Self-investigation by the Chamber of Commerce; (3) Correcting last year's approach, with all guilds paying the amounts already determined; (4) Publicly electing representatives to present the business difficulties of the county to the bureau, requesting continued reduction and payment by the Chamber of Commerce; (5) Requesting representatives to notify the provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce to advocate for a unified position among all counties; (6) Unanimously refusing investigation until a resolution is reached.</p>
<p>County Head and Public Security Chief Suddenly Leave Changshu Again (Changshu Correspondence) Tan Yigui, the county head of this county, previously went to the province a week ago to resign due to difficult issues, but returned without success. Yesterday (the 24th), Tan suddenly handed over the official seal to Jin Minjun, the head of the First Section, and Yin Peng, the head of the Public Security Bureau, also handed over the seal to Inspector Lu Baozhong, instructing him to forward it to Section Chief Pan. The two chiefs then left Changshu together in their own gasoline boat at 3:00 PM, leading to many rumors in the outside world.</p>
<p>Strictly Prevent Traitors from Spreading Poison (Gaoyou Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs telegraphed the county government of this county on behalf of Ma Ri, stating that the Public Security Bureau of Funing Town reported the following: Several traitors were recently captured and confessed that they were instructed by the Japanese to spread poison in wells near the locations where Chinese troops were stationed, in order to harm them. Therefore, strict prevention should be ordered.</p>
<p>Water Police Captain Arrested (Gaoyou Correspondence) Gao Zhongkui, the captain of the 25th Squad of the 6th District of the Provincial Water Police Force stationed in Xinghua, has been detained by the Yangzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office for a case. Yesterday, Inspector Zhang telegraphed the county government of this county, ordering the summoning of Teng Yunrong, the town head of Sanduo Town, and Ju Wenfu, a villager of Donghui Town, for questioning.</p>
<p>Zheduo Town Robbed by Bandits (Gaoyou Correspondence) In Zheduo Town, which belongs to the 6th District of the county, more than twenty bandits in uniform suddenly appeared at dusk the day before yesterday. Each wielding firearms, they searched houses one by one and shot and wounded a farmer named Liu San. Furthermore, according to a visitor from Yancheng, Liu Wenkui, the bandit leader who occupied Zheduo Town last autumn, was captured in Yancheng on the 12th of this month and has already been executed.</p>
<p>The 7th Division Comes to Hefei to Assist in Suppressing Communist Bandits (Hefei Correspondence) The central government, due to the rampant banditry of the Six Counties, has decided to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression to eliminate them. In addition to ordering the Henan-Anhui-Hubei Border Area Pacification Commissioner's Office to dispatch troops stationed in Shangcheng and Gushi to attack the bandits' flanks, it has also ordered the 7th Division under Wang Jun, stationed in Xuzhou and southern Suzhou, to go to Lu'an via Hefei to assist the 55th and 46th Divisions in attacking from the front. Li Shiding, the deputy commander of the 7th Division, led the vanguard 40th Regiment under Du Run and arrived in Dingyuan on the 17th.

<p>Commissioner Dispatched to Thoroughly Investigate Major Bribery Case (Xiaoshan Correspondence) Lai Jigeng, a resident of Xiangqi Fang in western Xiaoshan, was found to have stored opium, gambling tools, and military weapons at home. The county Public Security Bureau discovered this and dispatched an armed police brigade to search his home a few days ago. As a result, twelve catties of opium, several sets of gambling tiles, and a pistol were found. The witnesses were taken to the county for interrogation. Subsequently, someone came forward to mediate and offered 3,000 yuan as a bribe, which was to be distributed among the Public Security Bureau, the Party Headquarters, and the newspaper. The case has been reported to the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs by the other party. Yesterday, the province dispatched Commissioner Wu to rush to Xiaoshan to investigate the facts of the case for verification.</p>

<p>The banditry in the Nanshan area, bordering the three counties of Chaozhou, Puning, and Huilai in Guangdong, has been cleared since Zhang Ruigui personally led troops to suppress them last month. Post-war work is underway. Yesterday, the Chaozhou Association in Shanghai sent a special telegram to Zhang, which stated: "To Commander Zhang Ruigui of Shantou, We have heard from afar that your troops have suppressed bandits and eliminated harm for the people. We are deeply grateful. We earnestly request that you strictly order your subordinates to be cautious and verify carefully when capturing bandits, and not to implicate innocent people. Also, do not use the search for fugitive bandits as an excuse to extort money from the villagers. Only in this way can the military and the people be harmonious, and the effect of appeasing and pacifying them can be achieved. We offer our humble advice and hope you will pay attention to it. Sincerely, The National Salvation Committee of the Chaozhou Association in Shanghai."</p>

<p>Two Thousand Points to One Thousand Four Hundred and Ninety-Six Points</p>
<p>—Li Gongying First Place with Largest Single Score—</p>
<p>The Shanghai International High-Level Shooting Competition, which has seen fierce competition among heroes for a month, concluded with the Portuguese Medina defeating Li Gongying in the final match yesterday and the day before with a score of 2,000 points to 1,496 points, winning this year's championship. After the competition ended at 11:30 PM last night, Mr. Bu Tuo, the chairman of the Shanghai Amateur Shooting Association, who presided over the competition, reported the results, congratulated Medina on his success, and encouraged Li Gongying to work hard and hope to compete again next year. Then, his wife presented the awards. Medina received the championship silver cup, and Li Gongying received the prize for the largest individual score (143 points in one round). Amid cheers and applause, the closing ceremony was announced.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Yesterday's Championship Process <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The final was held over two days. On the first day, Medina scored 1,000 points and Li Gongying scored 750 points. Yesterday, the competition continued, with Medina scoring 500 points to 366 points in the first round and 500 points to 380 points in the second round, giving Medina the upper hand in both rounds. In total, Medina scored 2,000 points over the two days, while Li Gongying scored 1,496 points.</p>
<p>Round One: Initially, the two were neck and neck, with little difference in score. However, around the 15th shot, Medina was able to take advantage of every opportunity and score 50 points with one hand, making the situation tense. Li did not show weakness and performed two excellent shots in a row, earning applause from the audience and scoring 63 points, creating a refreshing atmosphere. But after a while, Li remained the same, still unable to stand out, due to not making good use of opportunities, which instead created opportunities for the opponent. After Medina scored large numbers of 54, 67, and 82, the distance between the two widened again, and Medina won the round with 500 points to 366 points.</p>
<p>Round Two: At this time, the scores of the two were nearly 400 points apart. Within ten shots, Medina added more than 100 points, increasing the difference to more than 515 points. Then, he suddenly stopped making progress, with no points scored for seven consecutive shots. Li seized this good opportunity and steadily advanced, at one point bringing the score to 1432 to 1816, reducing the difference to 384 points. But good times don't last forever. Medina showed no mercy and scored again, ultimately winning the final victory with 2,000 points to 1,496 points.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Overview of the Two Players' Skills <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Li Gongying defeated Medina in 1930, but Medina defeated Li in the following year. Medina's victory again this year means that in recent years, no one in the Shanghai Chinese and Western shooting circles can match the reputation of these two. Even in the future, it may not be easy to cultivate such special talent in the near future, because it is limited to innate qualities. The four games of victories and defeats between the two have been described in detail above, and the fighting skills of the two days are described as follows:</p>
<p>Medina: Short and stout, without pretension, gentle and elegant, with the demeanor of a Confucian general. He can hit the target at will. He is good at flanking warfare. He is especially calm when facing a formidable enemy. His final victory depends on this. Li Gongying: Tall and strong, with robust muscles. Outsiders cannot criticize our country as a sick man. He is good at long-range and close-range shots and is also skilled at deflecting shots. His usual performance is very impressive, but he seems to be inferior in important competitions. This is because his composure is insufficient, and when bad luck comes, he can only sigh and give up.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in response to the storm damage last year, which harmed crops, believed that the supply of cotton seeds this spring would be insufficient. In November last year, it presented a request to the Municipal Government to allocate funds to purchase hundreds of loads of high-quality cotton seeds from Changshu, Wangyin, and other places, preparing to resell them to farmers in various districts at the original price this spring for planting. Later, due to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, farmers in the entire city were affected by the war and faced livelihood difficulties, urgently needing relief. The bureau, in light of this, presented a request to the Municipal Government a few days ago to allocate the cotton seeds for spring relief, which was approved. The district municipal commissioners and farmers' associations have been ordered to receive and distribute them to provide relief and benefit spring plowing.</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Anti-Opium Society Questions Zhang Xueliang <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Public Sale of Opium in North China</p>
<p>The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society, due to recent reports in newspapers that the military authorities in the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan in North China have decided to implement the public sale of opium due to a lack of military funds, specially telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, the Pacification Director of Hebei, yesterday and requested a swift cancellation to ease public grievances. The telegram is recorded as follows: "Urgent. To Mr. Zhang Hanqing, Pacification Director of Beiping. It is reported that, according to recent reports in various newspapers here, the military authorities under your jurisdiction have decided to implement the public sale of opium due to a lack of military funds. The method is to set up a public sale office in each of the provinces of Rehe, Suiyuan, and Hebei, with Gao Jiyi in charge, expecting to obtain two million yuan per month. According to yesterday's report, the public sale of opium in Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan is scheduled to be implemented on May 1st. Rehe Province will levy an exit tax. The amount of raw opium arriving in Tianjin has reached more than 3,000 tons, and it is said that 30 million yuan can be collected annually. The exposure of this news has shocked the people of the country, and public opinion is in uproar. The members of our association are particularly alarmed. The central government once brazenly implemented the public sale of opium, but was ultimately opposed by the whole country, and public grievances were rampant. The Executive Yuan then explicitly ordered its cancellation and reiterated the ban on opium. When you were in charge of the outside of the passes, you also vigorously implemented the ban on opium, clearing away those with aspirations, and your reputation spread far and wide. Since the September 18th Incident, however, you have led heavy troops and stationed yourself inside the passes. The voice of criticism from the people of the country has been constant, but you have been understanding, perhaps due to a temporary miscalculation. Now, you are actually picking up the rejected policy of the central government, implementing public sales, poisoning the people, treating laws and regulations as trifles, and destroying public opinion. This kind of measure, even if it can maintain your subordinates and troops for a time, will leave a huge disaster for the nation for generations to come. The disaster of national subjugation and ethnic extermination may not be different from your idea of ​​making money through poisoning. Everyone makes mistakes, but persistent evil leads to doom. If you get on the wrong track, knowing the right way will save you. We guess that you are doing this because the four provinces outside the passes were lost in an instant, ten years of essence was used to aid the enemy, and finances became exhausted. In order to preserve private strength, you are unwilling to reduce expenses. Therefore, you are drinking poison to quench your thirst and are willing to set fire to yourself. You will see that the public will be angry and relatives will be alienated, and even if you have a million brave soldiers, it will be difficult to resist the sanctions of public opinion. What is the use of deploying troops when they cannot be used? How can one raise soldiers to harm the people? If you can lead troops to resist foreign aggression and serve as a national defense, the people will be your backing, and there will be no lack of military expenses. Our association is responsible for rejecting drugs, and we will give our lives for it. For several years, we have admired your clear reputation, but unexpectedly, you have been deeply bewitched at this time, surrounded by those around you, and you have adopted this bad strategy. It is really regrettable. We hope that you will examine the benefits and harms, dismiss the flatterers, focus on self-cultivation, and strive to make up for it later. Immediately issue an order to cancel the harsh policy of the public sale of opium and start anew with the people, so that public sentiment and expectations can still be achieved. We offer our loyal advice and await your instructions. Respectfully, The Chinese National Anti-Opium Society."</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Number of Dock Dues Collected <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The Maritime Customs authorities notified the Public Works Department that the amount of dock dues collected in the three months of this spring was 39,457.65 taels, which the Public Works Department should receive. According to the budget of the Public Works Department this year, the dock dues are listed at 600,000 taels, which is 150,000 taels less than last year. This is because the Public Works Department has redistributed this tax with neighboring areas, and the increasing number of goods unloaded in Pudong has caused the department's revenue to suffer quite a bit. In 1930, the Public Works Department received 748,336 taels, and in 1931, it received 645,488 taels, including 232,702 taels in autumn, 160,898 taels in summer, 162,605 taels in autumn, and 89,283 taels in winter. Due to the war this year, some ships unloaded goods destined for Shanghai in Hong Kong or Japanese ports in February and March, so the income from dock dues has greatly decreased. According to reports, this tax has always been collected by the Customs on behalf of the Public Works Department.</p>

<p>The Ferry Fee Still Collects Four Copper Coins</p>
<p>The cross-river ferry between Qingning Temple, run by the Municipal Government, and Dinghai Bridge was suspended because the Dinghai Bridge pier was located in a military area and most passengers did not dare to take it for fear of danger. Now that the situation has eased and the ferry can come and go without hindrance, it resumed service on April 26, from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM every day. The passenger fare remains the same as the original plan approved by the Municipal Government, charging four copper coins per person per trip.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Qianjiang Guild Hall, namely the Hangzhou Silk Group of the Shanghai Silk Trade Association, is known to be rich in assets. Lu Zhengbing, the person in charge of the guild hall, was previously asked by someone to request the Social Affairs Bureau to appoint an accountant to liquidate the guild hall's assets in order to reveal the truth. The Social Affairs Bureau issued an order in January this year to appoint Zheng Qi, the director of the National Goods Exhibition Hall, and accountant Pan Xulun to investigate and report in detail at the guild hall. Later, the two auditors Zheng and Pan repeatedly contacted the persons in charge of the guild hall, but the persons in charge repeatedly made excuses and delayed, refusing to submit the account books for investigation. Now, after more than three months, they have not been able to proceed. The two auditors Zheng and Pan jointly submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, strictly ordering Lu Zhengbing and others to submit the annual accounts of the Qianjiang Guild Hall by a deadline for detailed investigation and reporting.</p>

<p>The Owner Pursued and Two People Were Injured</p>
<p>Wang Yulin, a local resident, 50 years old, works as a night soil collector in the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council. His home is located at No. 722 Yongji Lane, Weihaiwei Road, Public Concession. At around 5:40 a.m. yesterday, when the maid was washing chamber pots at the back door, four bandits suddenly arrived. Two bandits were on guard outside, and two bandits took the opportunity to enter. One of them was armed with a pistol. They went straight up the stairs to the building and into the living room upstairs, into the bedroom of Wang Yulin's mother-in-law, Mrs. Zhang, lifted the quilt and snatched Wang Yulin's four-year-old son, Fuhai, and ran straight downstairs to escape. At that time, Mrs. Zhang immediately cried for help. Wang and his wife, who lived in the adjacent room, heard the alarm and chased after them. The kidnappers fired two shots at the stairway entrance. One hit Wang's right leg, and the other hit the waist of Li Tao, the Zhao family's nanny who lived with them. The bandits then snatched the child and rushed out the door, disappearing in an instant. Afterwards, Wang's family reported to the New Gate Police Station and asked for an investigation. Both injured people were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. Li Tao's injuries were more serious. As for whether the bandits escaped by car or rickshaw when they left the door, it has not been confirmed for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Huang Chujiu's Jadeite Case <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Three-Tenths Belong to Liu Baogeng</p>
<p>Already Confirmed by Court Judgment</p>
<p>The Shanghai Daily Night Bank and the Great World Amusement Deposit Department went bankrupt and owed more than 3 million in debt after Huang Chujiu's death two years ago. Creditors filed lawsuits one after another. The former Mixed Court appointed accountants Pan Zhaobang and Wu Cheng to liquidate Huang's Gongfa Company's assets and Huang's private property to repay the debt. Subsequently, the accountants found in Huang's private property catalog a piece of jadeite weighing 330 pounds, worth 16,000 yuan, which was handed over to Liu Baogeng, a jade dealer at No. 454 Lafayette Road, to carve. The accountants filed a petition with the Second Special District Court to summon Liu to the court and order him to deposit the jadeite with the court for disposal. Liu then claimed that this jadeite was jointly purchased with Huang on a daily basis, and he had a 30% share and had paid 4,800 yuan. Huang's sons, Xianzhong and Xianyao, included it in their private property, and his own 30% share was lost. Therefore, he hired lawyer Lin Yingqing as his agent, presented evidence, and filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against the two accountants, Pan and Wu, and Huang's two sons, requesting confirmation of his 30% ownership of the jadeite. Judge Qu Zengze repeatedly held court sessions to collect information, declared the debate closed, and ruled that the plaintiff, Liu Baogeng, had a 30% co-ownership of the jadeite, and rejected the lawsuit against Pan Zhaobang and Wu Cheng. The plaintiff bore one-fifth of the litigation costs, and Huang Xianzhong and Xianyao bore four-fifths. The judgment has been served and confirmed.</p>

<p>The Foreign Affairs Compilation Agency at No. 90, the corner of Rue Lubeck and Avenue Messimer in this city, has been distributing manuscripts since the first of this month. In less than a month, the number of newspapers and individuals subscribing to the group has reached 170. It can be imagined that it meets the needs. The agency distributes an average of 14,000 to 15,000 words per day, and it is quite difficult to typeset and print. Therefore, it was decided to use lead printing to distribute the manuscripts in order to facilitate newspapers and readers. This was implemented yesterday, and satirical cartoons about China from foreign newspapers were also printed. In addition to distributing them to subscribers, they were also sold at newspaper stands for 20 cents per copy. However, subscribers receive a special delivery one day in advance, so subscribers were able to read them last night.</p>

<p>Midnight Chopping with a Kitchen Knife</p>
<p>Mrs. Peng Chen, a woman from Tongzhou, resides at No. 77 Yangshupu Road. Her son-in-law, Bian Yaoqin from Ningbo, does not engage in proper work and associates with hooligans. He often borrows money from her and squanders it, amounting to hundreds of gold. Mrs. Peng could not help but quarrel and scold him from time to time. Bian suddenly had malicious intentions. At midnight the night before, while Mrs. Peng was asleep, he held a kitchen knife and sneaked into the bedroom, violently chopping at her head and hands, attempting to harm her. Mrs. Peng screamed for help. Bian immediately abandoned the knife and fled. Fortunately, Mrs. Peng's injuries were very minor. She went to the hospital for treatment. After the doctor bandaged her, she was discharged from the hospital after a while. She then reported to the Yangshupu Police Station, who sent detectives to arrest Bian. He was brought to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, explained the situation. The kitchen knife was presented as evidence. According to Mrs. Peng Chen's statement, the defendant confessed that he had taken this action out of anger because he was repeatedly ridiculed by the plaintiff. He claimed that he only slightly struck her with the back of the knife and had no intention of killing her. He denied borrowing hundreds of yuan. He asked for judgment.

<p>Two Secular Friends Suspected</p>
<p>There is a Caocun Temple west of Yangsi Bridge in Pudong. There is only one monk named Huacheng, about 40 years old, who is from Jiangxi. He has been the abbot of the temple for more than ten years and has a good reputation for observing Buddhist rules. There are no other monks in the temple, nor are there any temple managers. Only an old woman is hired, who is over 60 years old, deaf and blind, to do the washing and cleaning. Huacheng has accumulated considerable savings over the past ten years, which has aroused the covetousness of bandits. Two days ago, two secular friends (both wearing blue cloth short shirts and pants) came to stay overnight. Huacheng immediately took them in and lived with them for two nights. The monk was suddenly killed the night before, and the two secular friends fled. It was not until yesterday morning that the locals learned about it. They saw countless knife wounds on Huacheng's head, face, neck, and throat. There was a kitchen knife nearby. When asked about the old woman, she could not understand anything because she was dizzy and blind. It is thought that the motive was robbery, so the police station was notified to order the local bailiff Zhang Huishan to report to the local court for inspection.</p>

<p>Forging Diplomas to Make a Living</p>
<p>Investigation Reveals the Arrest</p>
<p>Zhang Liang, courtesy name Chaoren, 29 years old, from Huzhou, lives at No. 2 Fenghuan Lane, Fangxie Road, West Gate. He has a prestigious job in society. He believes that the Shanghai lawyer profession has been thriving in recent years. He was eager to try. He obtained a forged 14th-year graduation diploma from the Zhejiang Public Law School and submitted it to the Lawyer Qualification Committee of the Judicial Yuan to apply for a lawyer's license. Suspecting that the diploma was questionable, the committee sent a letter to the school to inquire whether there was a graduate named Zhang Liang. The school found no such person and reported to the Ministry of Justice, which secretly ordered the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office to arrest him. Zhu Wan, a secret agent, was secretly dispatched to arrest him. It has been more than a month, but Zhang no longer lives there and cannot be arrested. The day before yesterday, the bailiff found his relatives and learned where Zhang was recently living. Fearing that he would be alerted, he wrote a note stating that the certificate had been sent to the court and asked him to go to the court to collect it with a photo for verification. Zhang was overjoyed after receiving the note. He first ordered his brother to take the photo to the court to contact the bailiff. After observing that it was not the person himself, he ordered him to bring the person himself to collect it. Yesterday, Zhang personally went to the court. The bailiff then showed the arrest warrant. Zhang was shocked and repeatedly shouted that he had been tricked. He immediately reported to the prosecutor to open the court. Zhang confessed that the diploma was given by a friend surnamed Wang, who filled in the name, date, and year, and he affixed the stamps himself. He said that he completely wanted to make a living. The official immediately ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>

It is learned that the shelter was officially established yesterday, and more than 500 people have moved in. However, funding is extremely difficult, so members have been sent to raise donations from all walks of life. Each fundraiser has the association's badge and donation book. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to it.</p>

Yesterday morning, his body was found in the area west of the Shenxin Factory. He had a knife wound on his abdomen, and blood was everywhere. The patrol police reported to the Sixth District Police Station and found his family members, who confirmed his identity. Because the area was narrow and there were many onlookers, the body was moved to Bailly Road and Zhongshan Road, and the local bailiff was ordered to report to the court for inspection.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Giro's Words and Deeds <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu From Suzhou</p>
<p>Dr. Giro, who travels the globe, is a Caucasian from Turkey's neighboring country. Since joining the Chinese Nationalist Party in 1918, he has been determined to promote the Three People's Principles, awaken small and weak nations, and seek the realization of world harmony. In the spring of the year before last, he entered China and traveled to various places. So far, he has traveled to seventeen provinces. In the past, Dr. Giro and his translator, Mr. Qiao, came to Suzhou from Hangzhou and stayed at the Xinchan Hotel in Jinmen. Many people from all walks of life in this city went to visit him. I admired his great spirit and went to visit him. I was honored to hear his talk, which was quite alarming, and he had many important points on the way to resist Japan. I was inspired by listening to it, so I summarized and recorded it as follows. (The following are all Mr. Ji's words) Japan's annexation of the Northeast was indeed a planned action, but it was also based on the dramatic progress of Chinese people's intelligence. If it was delayed, it would be difficult to start. Therefore, it was launched decisively on September 18. However, China not only did not resist, but also endured humiliation and sought perfection, begging for mercy from the League of Nations, exposing its weaknesses, which led to the Shanghai Incident. However, China was still not aware of it. Millions of troops across the country were only fighting with the Nineteenth Route Army and the Fifth Route Army. Of course, they were outnumbered and not to the point of utter defeat. It was already a great fortune, but the government authorities still relied on the League of Nations and did not seek their own resolution. It is really puzzling. I know deeply that the League of Nations is the main camp of the great powers. Weak countries can never get any help from it. To put it bluntly, seeking the League of Nations is like a lamb in distress, seeking help from jackals and wolves, just to hasten its own demise. The only way for China to save itself now is to awaken the people of the whole country, save money on food and clothing, purchase military fire, and prepare for armed resistance. All the troops in the country should be sent to the border to implement self-defense. The people of the whole country should implement a thorough economic boycott of Japan. After one year, Japan can be paralyzed. After two years, Japan can be destroyed without attack. There is one more thing that deserves special attention. I hope you will tell your compatriots. I passed through Hong Kong and met Mrs. Luren, a White Russian general. According to her, all White Russians are fed by the Japanese. They have now been concentrated in various places, waiting for an opportunity to disrupt China. From this point of view, China is like a lone boat trapped in a storm. There are enemies in front, behind, left, and right. If we do not rise up and plan for it quickly, disaster will be imminent.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Robbery of Malu <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>During this Japanese invasion, Jiading County was completely occupied by the enemy. Most of the residents of the county moved to Qingpu. Yesterday, I met an old friend, Mr. Zhang, who talked about the situation of his hometown, Malu, being ravaged by the Japanese army. It was so tragic that it was unbearable to hear. So I picked up a few things to express my grief. (1) Malu is an important road from Nanxiang to Jiading, with about hundreds of households and twenty or thirty shops. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Japanese disguised themselves as villagers and went to the town to investigate military intelligence. They were arrested by the Defense Regiment. After Mr. Zhang's uncle briefly inquired, he was released lightly. Unexpectedly, after the Japanese army occupied the town, the previously arrested Japanese spy falsely accused Mr. Zhang's uncle of being the leader of the plainclothes team. He had been tied to the playground of the central elementary school, preparing to be shot. Fortunately, a gentleman who had worked in a Japanese store in Hongkou had kinship with him, spoke Japanese, and proved that he had opened a pharmacy, was nearly seventy years old, was kind, and believed in Buddhism, and was definitely not the leader of the plainclothes team, so he was spared. (2) An old woman surnamed Wang, a farmer in a village near Malu, was over sixty years old, energetic, and usually led her children and daughters-in-law to engage in agriculture, working diligently. When the Nineteenth Route Army retreated to the second line of defense, the neighboring residents fled far away. She could not bear to abandon the family she had built with her own hands for decades, so she ordered her children and daughters-in-law to flee to other towns, while she stayed in her home to observe the situation. After the Japanese army arrived in the town, they searched everywhere. When they went to her house, they rummaged through boxes and cabinets and plundered away. Before leaving, they saw the old woman pressing her chest with her hand, suspecting that she was hiding military fire. They ordered her to take off her clothes for inspection. The old woman firmly refused, which led to her being shot. Afterwards, her children and daughters-in-law returned home and only saw bloodstains. They did not see the body. They still hoped that she would return alive. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, they were digging a ditch with hoes and found a leg. They removed the mud and saw the whole body. According to them, she refused to be searched because she had banknotes hidden on her body. After being shot, the Japanese soldiers looted everything and abandoned the body in the field.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>The Light World of Fish There are several seas and oceans in the world, the depth of which is fully five miles. Below is pitch black, and any light cannot reach. Therefore, the water pressure is extremely strong. Even in that dark water depth, there are many strange fish living there, which will never collide, because nature gives them a light, each shining on their heads, which can illuminate the way of travel without hindrance. The kind of light is very strange. It turns out that there are several kinds of microorganisms that can emit phosphorescence. Thousands of them live together, forming a bright colony. They often live in the middle of the fish scales, and when you look at them, it is a bright light. Some fish open their own power plants, because their scales will glow by themselves without the help of microorganisms. There are also many fish on the seabed that have two eyes mounted on long, fleshy stalks that protrude in front and can also be used as bright lights. Even more strangely, some fish grow a fleshy stalk in their nose, and a small lamp is installed on the head of the stalk, just above its large lower jawbone. When small fish see the light, they swim up to watch and play and are swallowed into their stomachs.</p>

<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 5: The ungrateful termination of friendship unfortunately provokes the anger of a generous stranger. The most difficult thing to bear is the kindness of a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>After the incident, Anjia Village was burned and killed, and nine out of ten houses were empty. Only corpses and rubble remained on the ground. Niu Heifeng finally vented his anger and led the bandits away. When the officers and soldiers heard the news and came to rescue, Niu Heifeng had already gone far away, and the sacrifice of Anjia Village was in vain. Seeing that he had caused a great disaster, An Dakui was so frightened that he fled the bandit area overnight and returned to the military headquarters to work. Fortunately, his family had already been taken outside, so he was unharmed. Now he occupied the property of a firm, so he did not even recognize his own nephew. Looking at it, this person was so greedy that he was not good enough to his family or friends. When Wei Zhuomou talked about this with indignation, he could not help but temporarily put away his joking attitude and issued extremely radical remarks, advising An Yutian to tell his fellow villagers and unite to bring him to justice. An Yutian was sobbing and sighing. At this point, he suddenly sighed and said, "What Uncle Dakui did is certainly not right, but Niu Heifeng is an evil bandit, and I have a deadly feud with him. I cannot take revenge on outsiders first, but only know to settle accounts and fight for property with my family. It is still not right. Let's forget it. Now I am determined not to let him provide me with expenses. Is the world so big that I, An Yutian, with a seven-foot body, cannot be self-reliant and make a living?" Wei Zhuomou immediately laughed and said, "Good. You really have ambition. I admire you." As he said this, he glanced at Liang Xiaoyun. He only saw that she always maintained a humorous state and did not praise him rashly, but turned her beautiful eyes to Wei Zhuomou's side, as if to say that she wanted to say something, but it was inconvenient to say it while you were here. Wei Zhuomou understood and got up to say goodbye, "I have said everything I should report. I can't be so ignorant and stay here to be an annoying person. I'd better roll first before the duck egg grows feet, so that you two can talk quietly for a while." After saying that, he ran away with a book, grinning and shaking his head. Liang Xiaoyun did not retain him, but remained very calm and sat opposite An Yutian in the study. An Yutian only lowered his head and sighed, and had nothing else to say to Liang Xiaoyun. After a while, Liang Xiaoyun stretched lazily. That delicate and languid sigh startled An Yutian and made him look up at her. He happened to meet Liang Xiaoyun's charming and soft eyes. An Yutian just felt dazed, but Liang Xiaoyun's cheeks were also slightly red, and she said with a smile, "I'm a little tired. Why don't you accompany me to the other room? Let's lie down for a while and talk. How about it?"</p>

<p>The Price of Silver Sycee Continues to Fall Endlessly?</p>
<p>Breaking Through the 7 Qian Mark</p>
<p>Inventory Exceeds 20.6 Million</p>
<p>Source Continues to Flow In Abundantly</p>
<p>Market Overview: Since the dramatic changes brought about by the invasion of Shanghai by the violent Japanese, the city's commerce has undergone repeated transformations. The financial sector, as the linchpin of all industries, could hardly maintain stability on its own. This time, it has been overwhelmed by the influx of sources from various ports, while sales have stagnated, leading to a remarkably large inventory. According to recent surveys, it has already exceeded 20.6 million, truly a new record. Moreover, the inflow of sources from various ports along the Yangtze River continues unabated, amounting to hundreds of thousands or one to two million each day, leaving the price of silver sycee unable to resist, resulting in a catastrophic decline with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Sycee Exchange Rates: "Foreign Sycee" fell close to the 7 qian mark yesterday morning, reaching 6 qian, 9 fen, 9 li and a half, lower by 7 hao and a half compared to the lowest price in the previous day's afternoon market. In the afternoon market, the general sentiment was that such a low price could not compete, but no one dared to buy in speculatively, so transactions were few. The price remained the same as in the morning market, at 6 qian, 9 fen, 9 li and a half. "Silver Sycee" remained at 1 qian in both the morning and afternoon markets, with banks quoting 4 fen. However, the practice of adding water to the drawings seemed to have become excessively lax, with blank drawings being offered yesterday, but no one accepting them, mainly due to the excessive padding. However, this market price fluctuates unpredictably, making it difficult to set a reliable benchmark for the market.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small silver dollars followed the fall of foreign silver sycee, dropping to 6 qian with nothing extra in the morning and afternoon markets, down 1 li and 7 hao and a half from the previous day's morning market. Transactions were 2,000 jiao in the morning market and 1,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars also fell due to the drop in foreign silver sycee, in order to maintain a balanced exchange rate, falling close to the 6 qian mark yesterday, reaching 5 qian, 9 fen, 8 li in the morning market and 5 qian, 9 fen, 6 li and a half in the afternoon market, a decrease of 5 li and 2 hao and a half compared to the previous day's morning market. Transactions were 155,000 jiao in the morning market and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rose along with the others by 2,500 wen, reaching 419,500 wen, only a limited distance from the 420,000 wen mark. This is also unprecedented since there was a market price for copper coins.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: "Silver Funds" were quite active in bank receipts and disbursements yesterday. Chinese merchants took in over 3.2 million in various receipts, foreign merchants over 4.4 million, and exchange, cargo mortgage, customs duties, and advances amounted to slightly over 6 million. Money shops and silver public firms took in over 29 million, silver drawing funds took in over 2.3 million, and exchange ticket transactions also reached over 2.3 million, an increase of several hundred thousand compared to the previous day. "Foreign Funds" exchange ticket funds totaled 840,000 in the morning market and 365,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 70,000 in the morning market and 10,000 in the afternoon market. Interbank trading in the morning market was 750,000 and in the afternoon market 300,000. Various banks' foreign accounts had receipts and disbursements of over 1.1 million, banknote inflows and outflows were 700,000 to 800,000, money shops' foreign public firms had receipts and disbursements of over 4.8 million, re-drawing funds totaled over 1.4 million, and small silver dollar shop transactions amounted to over 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Forward Gold Advances <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Soaring to 10 Taels, 9 Qian</p>
<p>Active Buyers: Forward gold rebounded and trended higher, with excellent momentum, advancing the price by as much as four or five taels. There was a total difference of ten taels between the morning and evening sessions, ultimately rising by more than ten taels. The rise was evident from the start, even though the silver market had not changed. Furthermore, repeated sharp declines in exchange rates, with the British exchange secretly stabilizing, and the trend of the U.S. dollar remaining strong, further boosted confidence. Consequently, the price broke through 720 taels. However, a slight pullback at noon brought out sellers, and the market then resumed its upward trend, driven by demand exceeding supply, eventually exceeding 20 taels. The lack of market activity for bills of exchange on Wednesday contributed to the situation.</p>
<p>High Opening: The June contract opened high, adding 2 taels and 7 qian, reaching 712 taels and a half. There were expectations of further gains overnight, but this did not materialize. Although the U.S. dollar increased in price, purchases were not affected, as the private telegraphic rate for silver was down by one-eighth, boosting confidence. Yuan Heng, Heng Yu, Tai Chang, and others took the lead in advancing, adding 3 taels until 9:30 a.m., when HSBC quoted a British gold increase of 1.25 and a U.S. dollar decrease of 1.25, reaching 15 taels and 6 qian. Fluctuations of around one tael occurred within half an hour, reflecting the prices of bank transactions. British gold initially absorbed half a penny, and U.S. dollars for forward settlement reached .375, then .1875. Mitsui bought May at .0625, and HSBC offered August British gold at .375. The buying spree by Yuan Heng, Hong Kang, Yong Fu, Tai Heng, Xie Yu, Yong Tong, Tai Chang, Shun Li, and others drove the price beyond 20 taels, reaching 21 taels after 10 a.m. Zih Feng, Yong Yi Feng, Kang Yuan, Kang Xiang, and others then sold, retreating to 18 taels and a half after twenty-five minutes. Fortunately, the exchange market remained tight. Anda absorbed August U.S. dollars at .1875, and Hua Bank absorbed May at 31 yuan, also hedging British gold at .375. Yuan Chun, Da De Cheng, Wu Pin, Yong Feng, and others showed strong buying interest. Rumor had it that a certain bank had opened 210 spot contracts sold by Tong Feng Yong, but the bank denied it.

<p>About 1 Yuan Better than at the Start of the Week</p>
<p>There were no gray market transactions on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange the day before, so there were no gray market prices. Yesterday, gray market trading resumed as normal, and activity was lively. Total bond transactions were estimated at 80,000 yuan. The gray market trend was upward, due to a general sense of optimism because of the easing diplomatic situation and the hope of restarting the Sino-Japanese negotiations on the Shanghai Incident. Prices were all up by about 1 yuan, except for 96 Bonds which were unquoted, and Customs Bonds which were only up by a few jiao. The following are estimated gray market prices for various bonds:</p>

<h3 id="e151">Cotton Yarn: No Hope for Recovery Under Various Pressures <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Another Decline of 5 Qian to Over 1 Liang</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market's declining trend has not stopped, and the situation is very weak. Constrained by finance and burdened by last year's severe drought, the situation in the interior is indescribable. Purchasing power has been greatly reduced, and the price of foreign silver sycee has fallen below 7 qian, increasing anxiety. However, Sichuan merchants have made some purchases. According to some sources, business with the outside world in Sichuan is still difficult to improve, and the economic situation is dire, making large transactions difficult to realize. Although the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is trying to resolve the closure of Guangdong silver shops, it is still difficult to recover in the short term, which has greatly affected yarn sales. As a result, market sentiment remains depressed. Some popular yarns have temporarily stabilized after days of sharp declines, but unpopular yarns continue to fall sharply. Based on the current situation, there is no hope for recovery in the short term. Statistics for the full day show that various merchants bought 600 bales, including 60 bales among peers, 115 bales bought by Guangdong merchants, 260 bales by Sichuan merchants, 25 bales by Wenzhou merchants, 55 bales by Tianjin merchants, 15 bales by merchants in the interior, and 25 bales by Fujian merchants. Prices fell again by about 5 qian to over 1 liang.</p>

<p>The cotton market lacks vitality and is extremely depressed. The financial situation is dire, and yarn prices are unstable, making factories increasingly unwilling to operate. As for foreign cotton, the market is still declining. It is reported that Fire Machine cotton was priced within the 30 liang range.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Revision of New Standards for Cotton Yarn and Cloth <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Standard Yarn: 20s "Ren Zhong" (人鐘) Brand</p>
<p>Standard Cotton: Zhengzhou Fine Velvet Cotton</p>
<p>The issue of revising the new standards for cotton yarn and cloth at the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange was discussed at the appraisal meeting yesterday. For cotton yarn, it has been decided to use Shanghai Shenxin Factory's 20s "Ren Zhong" brand yarn as the standard. The standard yarn appraised this period is valid for buying and selling from July, August, September, and October. The cotton appraisal meeting will be held this afternoon. All names such as Fire Machine cotton and Shanghai local cotton will be changed to Shanghai Cotton. The standard will be Zhengzhou Fine Velvet Cotton. The Shanghai Cotton grade will be reduced by about 3 liang. The following is a detailed table of the grade increases and decreases for cotton yarn appraisal:</p>

<p>Near-Term American Cotton Breaks Through 6-Fen Mark</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was weak due to a lack of major buyers, the liquidation of long positions, and disappointed factory sentiment.

Indian cotton was sold slightly during the rise. The original telegram from Liverpool (dated the 26th) recorded Ping Guo Er unchanged, Bai Luo Creek up 1.75.</p>

<p>Spot Flour Weakens</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot flour market suddenly showed a weak and unsustainable appearance. Due to the inactivity of actual sales in the North, and stagnation in Guangfu, the existing goods about 500,000 to 600,000 bags, are moving. A small number of bulls could not wait and sold at bargain prices. However, there was little interest from buyers, so the price dropped significantly, by about two fen compared to the previous day. There is currently no difference between April and May spot goods. The opening price for May goods ranged from 8.5 fen to as low as 7.5 fen. However, goods from factories that are unavailable in the market are still priced high, such as Maigenxu at 1 qian net, and Shuangma at 9 fen net. Fuxin factory goods are still offered at 2 liang, 1 qian and 5 fen discounted, and they insist on that price.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Rice Market in Hexia Flat and Weak <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from various merchants. Due to bad weather, there were not many buyers at local stores. Thick Japonica rice was stable, and some thin Indica rice arrived. The market was congested, and the outgoing goods on this street, top-grade rice, moved slightly. There was little demand for foreign Dujian rice, and the opening price was 2 jiao lower. Early rice and Yin Yuan rice arrived and sold at a balanced rate. The market did not fluctuate.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, the rice market was sluggish. Shops lining the market were relatively active, but turnover was limited, making it difficult to stabilize sales. There was a tendency to lower prices. There were few Changshu and Xishui goods arriving, and prices stabilized. Early and late rice, as well as the selling of altered Yin Yuan rice, were dull, with prices slightly down by a jiao. Not many foreign Dujian rice arrived, and the opening price remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Sales of Foreign Rice Continue to be Strong <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market temporarily stabilized. Due to the fact that the passports led by the Jiangbei gang have not yet been issued, there is no large selling group. However, in order to expand sales channels, foreign merchants allow foreign rice shipped to other ports to be handled according to the bank mortgage method, and the payment can be collected in the sales location. This aroused the consultants of the foreign gang, and the appetite of the users on our street and the hoarders was particularly good, so the market was strong and the high-priced goods were able to recover their prices. The general office opened 5,000 packages of Small Jiao rice, priced at 10 yuan, 1 jiao and 8 fen to 9 yuan and 8 jiao and 7 fen, 2,500 packages of No. 1 Saigon rice, priced at 11 yuan, 3 jiao and a half to 11 yuan and 1 jiao, and 200 packages of Mindang rice, priced at 10 yuan and 3 jiao. Except for 2,000 packages of Small Jiao handled by the Yangtze River gang, they were all received by the households on our street. The futures opening of Small Jiao in May was 250 tons, priced at 5 liang, and No. 1 Saigon in May was 300 tons, priced at 5 liang and 2 qian and a half. The market price was also similar to the previous day.</p>

<p>Purely Affected by Rain and Cold in Spring</p>
<p>Third Sleep Delayed</p>
<p>Linping in Zhejiang and Hangzhou has always been a famous silkworm rearing area. This year, due to economic reasons, the number of silkworm eggs raised has been greatly reduced, only accounting for 40% of previous years. After the eggs were hatched, the development was quite good. The early batch was about to enter the third sleep, and the late batch was also consuming leaves well in the second sleep. However, in recent days, it has been rainy and not sunny, and the weather has been very cold, causing the silkworms that have eaten enough leaves in the second sleep to delay their third sleep. The silkworms that were consuming leaves well are also eating less, and buyers are using fire to supplement heat.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign merchants' silk market in this port was increasingly lifeless. The New York telegram turned white, and the price for B-grade material was still less than 500 liang. Factories had difficulty selling at a loss. Silk sales in England and France were still quiet. Yesterday, only Boxin imported 6 packages of Huang Yao Warp silk, Xiangji imported 10 packages of Huang Coarse silk, and Kechang imported 16 packages of Huang silk. Prices were generally flat and weak.</p>

<p>Recently, sales of woolen cloth have been low, with few large transactions, and prices have been declining. The poor market sentiment is rare in recent years. Both buyers and sellers feel difficult, and most brokers have stopped trading. However, imported goods continue to arrive, mostly goods temporarily stored in Hong Kong last time. It is heard that a large batch of goods will arrive next month, because since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the woolen cloth industry has cancelled orders from foreign firms. Yesterday, the guild received a letter from the Foreign Merchants' Import Association, stating that the situation is peaceful and the goods must be loaded. The guild replied that if the situation is peaceful and the goods can flow smoothly, we will agree. Now, we have received another letter from the association, stating that the situation is largely restored to normal, and the goods must be loaded now, and it will take 42 days to arrive in port. There is no reason to postpone it again, please inform all members. It is expected that a large batch of several thousand boxes of woolen cloth will be imported next month.</p>

<p>Jubao Basin Yuanqing Zhigong Serge is exclusively distributed by British Anli Foreign Firm. It has had strong sales over the years and is a well-known brand of Zhigong serge. There is a joint brand contract among traders, so the selling price is unified. The highest selling price in previous years was 7 liang, and the lowest was 6 liang and 5 qian. This spring, the opening price was also 6 liang and 5 qian. Due to slow sales in the market and falling prices of various goods, traders decided yesterday to reduce the price by 2.5 qian per yard, and the wholesale price is only 6 liang and 2.5 qian per yard. If selling original box to brokers for resale, some commissions can be deducted at their discretion.</p>

<p>— Jin</p>
<p>Since Zhabei experienced severe artillery fire, the good residents have all fled, and the houses and huts have become rubble, creating a desolate scene of wailing and howling, almost an uninhabited area.</p>
<p>Consequently, Zhao Xinbo of Zhabei, Zheng Xiaoxu of Zhabei, and others, relying on false pretenses and leveraging each other's influence, organized things like "Pseudo Local Maintenance Committees." These rebellious bandits will naturally be sanctioned by national laws, which I won't concern myself with.</p>
<p>Now, the Japanese are also using Koreans to colonize Zhabei. On one hand, Koreans from Dalian and Qingdao, instructed by the Japanese authorities, are forming commercial inspection groups to inspect Zhabei. On the other hand, three groups of Korean prostitutes are being moved from Qingdao to provide entertainment for the Japanese soldiers. Looking at it this way, what kind of phenomenon does the world of Zhabei present? Righteous Chinese people would never want to live in Zhabei, nor would they want to see such a situation. Although there is talk of a turning point in the ceasefire negotiations, and the drafting committee started yesterday, I don't believe there will be any results. The ceasefire negotiations have been going on for a long time; one day they say this, the next day they say that. What value does such a conference have?</p>
<p>In short, until the Japanese soldiers have completely withdrawn, not only Zhabei is off-limits, but also any place near Zhabei within the Japanese military's sphere of influence. Avoid being coerced and humiliated by traitors.</p>
<p>The other day, a telegram from Shenyang reported that Gu Weijun's staff, Ge Gongzhen, and six or seven others, were surrounded and arrested by pseudo-state military police when they entered Shenyang city to investigate the situation. Although nominally pseudo-state military police, it goes without saying who commands these pseudo-state military police. Therefore, Chinese people cannot go to the Northeast, just as our good people cannot go to Zhabei.</p>
<p>The League of Nations' dispatch of an investigation team to inspect the Northeast was originally a ridiculous and perfunctory move. Zhang Xueliang consistently embraced a policy of non-resistance, and there were originally no traces of war in the Northeast. The puppet show of the bogus Manchukuo is known by everyone as a trick to deceive. What is the investigation team going to investigate?</p>

<p>— Zhou Ruichuan</p>
<p>People in the past often thought about how to keep the temperature of the water we use. Scientists also often thought about how to preserve liquefied gases for several hours. Because when you turn a gas into a liquid, if you don't find a way to preserve it, it will continue to evaporate due to the external temperature and become a gas again, because it is in a gaseous state at room temperature. For example, oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen are all in a gaseous state at room temperature. Since James Dewar (1842-1923), a Scottish scientist, invented the vacuum flask, this type of bottle that can keep warm (what we commonly call a thermos bottle) has been successful. The principle is to use a double-walled glass bottle (an inner layer and an outer layer) and completely extract the air in between using a pump, which creates a vacuum. If you put hot water in, the incoming and outgoing forces of convection and conduction of heat, except for a slight amount at the stopper, are nowhere to be found on the entire bottle. The inner layer of the outer wall and the outer layer of the inner wall are coated with mercury, so that its function is like a mirror, which can reflect the radiation falling on it. Heat is only transmitted by conduction, convection, and radiation as methods of heat transfer, so all three are separated from the external temperature, so the contents of this bottle can maintain its temperature for a long time. If you put liquefied gas - the temperature of this liquefied gas is always below minus one hundred degrees Celsius - or cold things in, its temperature is also insulated from the outside world, so it can also maintain its temperature for a long time.</p>

<p>— Hongshui</p>
<p>It was late, and the bright lights of light red and light green illuminated the scenery near "The Great World" as if it were daytime. Under the towering Western-style buildings, hundreds and thousands of people were crowded together, men, women, old, and young. Most of their faces were filled with joyful expressions, and they seemed to be lingering and wandering there.</p>
<p>"Buicks" and "Dodges," brightly colored cars, one after another, sped along the smooth and flat Edward Road. In the "Pa...pa..." sounds, it seemed like the wealthy merchants, gentlemen, ladies, and misses in "Motorcade" were saying triumphantly, "This is our blessing!"</p>
<p>The adjacent rows of cinemas, coffee shops, and dance halls enticed many fashionable couples; whispering sweet nothings, they ran inside in pairs to spend their entire evening, pursuing and indulging.</p>
<p>The red and green girls on the side of the road, living in the eighteenth hell, reluctantly created artificial "curves," displaying themselves in rows and groups with graceful and coquettish postures, in order to win the favor of those who seek flowers and willows, following them like flies chasing after something stinking and rank.</p>
<p>"Mountain Hermit of Crouching Clouds" and "Taoist of Mount Lu," countless fortune-tellers, each had one or two old women and three or four poor friends publicly on their stands, their eyes fixed on the glass plate that said, "No charge for the poor, no empty talk," under the dim kerosene lamp. They kept grumbling and asking: What is meant by "the father dies before the mother"? What is meant by "wearing my nose, eating my ears"?</p>
<p>In the corners of the alleys, there were people who played games of chance; shouting in an awful voice: "Press quickly, press quickly, it will open immediately..." Some would laugh heartily; while others would be wooden.</p>
<p>Wealthy people who had just returned from a drunken feast at the ×× Palace inevitably encountered beggars dressed in tattered clothes, following them and offering blessings in exchange for money...</p>
<p>If you don't know what Shanghai is really like, then you just need to run to "The Great World" and look around, and you will instantly see a true portrayal. Everything seems to be depicting the concrete epitome of the word "evil." Although on the other hand, you can also see the convenience of transportation and the development of culture, it always feels that "the flaws outweigh the merits."</p>

<p>— Yan Meng</p>
<p>Like an era of blood in the storms, wandering and drifting east, west, north, and south, like a flower detached from its branch, dried duckweed, fallen leaves. At the beginning of entering the world, harboring a full of enthusiasm, naturally, it is inevitable to complain and lament in the quiet deep night, and even drop pointless tears. Now, after being nurtured by unhealthy worldliness and experiencing the wind and frost of the human world, the tender buds of the soul have long been destroyed. Besides shuffling along the muddy streets, the life tasted is as ethereal as smoke, as unfounded as a dream.</p>
<p>The years urge old age, the sorrow of the old country, the oppression of life, lingering and nostalgic youth is fading, tender attempts, splendid dreams, only replaced by scars of food and clothing on the forehead. The most unsuitable for the life of a big city, the most unable to settle in the snobbish streets, and yet precisely in that big city made up of shame and sin, eking out a living as a fallen person.</p>
<p>Because the ambitions have not yet achieved even a small success, I am unwilling to be destroyed. As a result of striving for survival, after delving deep into the core of society, I realize that reactionary authorities in the world are easily tempted by utilitarianism. Therefore, everyone is conquered, bowing their heads and saying to the evil forces: "I surrender." Entering society is like leaving a pure and bright paradise. Young people, save yourselves quickly! Maintain your sincere and enlightened hearts and beware of the traps in the darkness.</p>
<p>For the sake of the unknowable future, hope is guiding us forward, giving us the heat and all the stimulation, just like the thorns beside the rose. However, the birds welcoming the spring are praising and singing. Living with tearful eyes, I originally wanted to explore the mystery and ultimate truth of life, but everything is shattered, demons occupy heaven, leaving us pure people in the cellar, they are still cursing. Friends, we are as tame as sheep, which is what constitutes the "good people" of sin! Why not raise our arms and shout: "Effort!"</p>

<p>— Gou</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local supplement's newspaper heading had two - one big and one small. The typesetting gentlemen certainly overlooked it, but the gentlemen who proofread the proofs were also inevitably careless, creating such a joke. Please, gentlemen readers, don't misunderstand and add one more because it looks good.</p>
<p>Zhu Zili, the central minister of the Qing Dynasty, had high cheekbones, a long beard, and many schemes, and was known as a double-material Cao Cao. In Peking opera, there are also double-package cases, and dramas with plays within plays, and riddle transmissions, etc. Now, there are two newspaper headings. Could it be that they are as good-looking as plays within plays?</p>
<p>No - no - definitely not - officials like to have as many concubines as possible, and wealthy merchants like to accumulate more and more gold and banknotes. Our local supplement actually learned to be aristocratic yesterday and took a concubine.</p>
<p>Someone said, good - according to what you said, please add one more tomorrow, or simply add a few more small newspaper headings. Wouldn't that be even more aristocratic?</p>
<p>I said no - more money means more people trying to help and getting busy, and more concubines means more waves of jealousy. I will never dare to take a concubine again in the future, haha!</p>

<p>— Xigang</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend came from Zhabei and said that Zhabei now is somewhat different from Zhabei when the artillery was booming and the fire was blazing! Now, it is full of peaceful scenes? Even though those guys with eight whiskers and chanting "Ge Da, Ge Da" are still strutting around!</p>
<p>In the past (since January 28th), on the streets of Zhabei, what the eyes saw were only kind people with faces full of grief and indignation, crying men, women, old, and young. What about now? Now, there are hordes of opium addicts, piles of gamblers, and groups of prostitutes appearing on the streets!</p>
<p>They have smiles on their faces, as if they are saying: "Fortunately, someone came to patronize this time, otherwise, we would never have a chance to make a name for ourselves"?</p>
<p>Indeed, Zhabei is peaceful after all, and the businesses of "opium," "gambling," and "prostitution" are particularly prosperous. They are living a happy (?) spring life!</p>
<p>Market News</p>
<p>Publication of Practical National Language Rhetoric - Mr. Jin Zhaozhi, a national history expert, recently authored a book entitled Practical National Language Rhetoric, which describes in detail everything about topics, materials, planning, composing, refining sentences, diction, ornamentation, etc. It has now been published by Zhonghua Book Company, priced at seven corners.</p>
<p>Big Discount at Sino-Western Pharmacy - Since the Japanese provoked a groundless incident on January 28th, the Zhabei area has been flooded with blood, and injuries and deaths have been countless. The summer is coming soon, and epidemics of various diseases are likely to run rampant. The so-called great war must be followed by a great epidemic. In view of this, the pharmacy has been pained to offer a special discount in order to reach a wide audience. In addition to the unprecedented price cuts on various medicines and cosmetics, foreign brand medicines and medical equipment are also sold at cost. Therefore, since the big discount started on the 15th of this month, the shop has been extremely crowded. During the discount period, celebrity perfume essence is also available as a gift.</p>
<p>Citizen Newspaper to be Published Soon - City Union members Wang Hanliang, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Liu Zhongying, etc., in order to develop municipal administration and assist public education, have specially founded a Citizen Newspaper, a thrice-weekly publication, with Cao Chi, a princess in the literary and art circles, as the editor-in-chief, and Xue Hanmei as the editor. It is reported that the newspaper will be published soon.</p>
