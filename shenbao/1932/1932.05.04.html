<h3 id="c1">五四運動與靑年　彬· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>在十三年前－－民八的今天。偉大的五四運動。正在北京展開光榮的序幕。</p>
<p>「五四運動。」不是偶發的。他之産生是具有着歷史與時代的背景。他是靑年的一個新紀元。這個新紀元否定了淸末的「戊戍維新運動。」推動中。國新思潮進入一新階段。但不久則又被「五卅事件」否定了他的自身。</p>
<p>自從鴉片戰爭以後。國際帝國主義的侵凌壓迫。便早已在中國種下了五四運動的遠因當一九一九年世界大戰剛剛終了。資本主義還没有踏上「第二個時期。」－－即「產業復興」的路程。由大戰所引起的人民對於戰爭的厭惡。又曾經爆發了企圖推翻舊的社會制度。永遠消滅戰爭的革命。在德國·在俄國·在匈牙利·都曾有這種革命運動發生。而新俄且於是時從舊俄的殘骸裏呱呱墮地。中國承受了此種潮流的激盪。而同時歐戰期間。日本哀的美敦書脅廹訂立的二十一條。更予中國人民以不可忍受的刺激。深深地感到不平等條約桎梏之苦痛。再就當時北京政府的本身看來。此時亦已經没有了統治全國的力量。新的勢力－－代表革命勢力的國民黨。正在舊的統治勢力之下蓬勃滋長。這樣。由國際情勢到國内政局之動盪傾側。與人民以不堪帝國主義之壓迫。發而爲求民族解放的思想。產生了五四運動的動機。到了巴黎和會開幕的時候。爲了賣國條約之未得推翻。北京的靑年學生。便於五月四日首先奮起。予一輩國奸以膺懲。這一聲。洪鐘立即喚起了全國各地山山海海的應聲。而光榮的五四運動便於以展開。</p>
<p>緊接於五四運動之後·革命的思潮。迅速轉變而爲新文化的思潮。新文體代替了舊文體。盡量地接受西歐的文化。打破了「中學爲體西學爲用」的成見。而最表現這一時代的特色的。就是各種各樣的主義和學說。都於此時介紹到中國來。每一個靑年。都爲其理想而追求着。直至「五卅事件。］思想的鬥爭。乃再變而爲行動的鬥爭。所以「五四運動」在我國歷史篇幅中。確實保有「劃時代」的榮光。</p>
<p>五四運動的眞價値。不在於他的運動的方式。而在於他確切地把握住了時代的思潮。現在。已經不是十三年前的五四時代了。這時候已經不是罷課游行貼標語喊口號請願的時代了。把握住時代的浪潮。立於時代的前面。獻身。爲推進時代的一員。這是靑年們在今日對於「五四」所應體認把握的敎訓。亦即靑年們在今日所應負荷的使命。</p>

<p>▲云因日軍部訓令未到延期</p>
<p>▲雙方昨繼續整理協定條文</p>
<p>▲某方謂大會星期四可重開</p>
<p>停戰會議、本定昨晨十時續開、嗣因日方對於蘇州河以南及浦東我軍防地問題之决定、尙未接到日軍部之訓令、要求延會、故昨未開成、惟昨日下午、中日英三方、各派代表一人、繼續開協定條文整理委員會、已將上次所未整理完畢之條文、全部整理結束、現會議已大致擬定明晨重開、並聞同日即可簽字云、</p>

<p>▲簽字手續簽字手續、本無須規定、但日方代表因被炸受傷、簽字時擬在病榻前行之、故爲愼重計、不得不加以討論、且我方代表郭泰祺、因被毆受傷、會議時亦將不能親自出席、故雙方擬定開會時、先由出席代表簽定草約、然後由中立國代表及雙方出席人分送至中日軍事外交四代表正式簽字、雙方簽字人規定各二人、我方爲首席代表郭泰祺、軍事代表戴戟、日爲首席代表植田、外交代表重光云、</p>

<h3 id="c90">◎遼寗義勇軍抗日紀　·瀋陽特約通訊· <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>最近各方對於吉黑抗日作戰狀况、報告甚多、而遼寗方面之消息、則頗沉寂、實則遼寗方面、抗日活動、並未消滅、惟各處已成隊伍之義勇軍、頗有變化、而普通民衆之反抗勢力、則逐漸增大、茲略述其近况如左、</p>
<p>（一）遼西方面金德喧石安全各部、於三月二十間曾襲擊綏中、將親日派張子淸之一部繳械、獲步槍三十餘支、後因子彈缺乏、敵人猛力轟擊、勢不能支、金部李崑山陣亡、石安全負傷、金石兩部、致遭瓦解、此役鄭桂林孫洗塵等部皆參加、鄭部早進早退、無損失、孫部損失頗重、前此北寗鐵路、不能通車達半月之久、亦即彼等之舉動也、鄭桂林部計千餘人、仍駐於綏中興城之間、力加整頓、以圖再抗、溝帮子以北、耿繼周所部約六百餘人、原來聲勢頗壯、旋投歸張海鵬、致所編大虎山左近之金子明部、亦隨之潰裂、惟劉鳳山部、尙有六七百人、勢力雄厚、正在積極訓練之中、錦西附近有于囗囗部、各方來人、均盛稱其組織罕密、紀律嚴明、與地方感情甚治、基本隊伍計五千餘人、現尙在訓練及組織期間、一俟成熟、即將出而抗日、</p>
<p>（二）遼南方面于明甲所部、多被日人解决、尙有李純華部約二千餘人、仍駐海城西之某地、頗能自存、遼陽之趙濟時等、曾與日抗、斃敵數十名、旋因日軍猛攻退守千山、瀋陽附近之那向陽金山奸等、於三月初旬、曾攻潘陽北關、繳得警察槍械二百餘支、旋退守防地、近於四月十七日又濳入瀋陽、焚燬糧秣廠、將所存軍糧、悉付一炬、又將瀋陽附近之電桿電線、截斷數里之遙、一時消息隔絕、事畢、曾散發告國聯調查團書表示民意、反對僞國、是時國聯調查團已先派數人到瀋、我東北民衆之不甘屈服於暴日、於此當可槪見、</p>
<p>（三）遼東方面鄧囗囗部、現駐安奉線之某地、勢力頗厚、正從事訓綀乘機活動、又某縣劉囗囗部約二千人已以其地勢險要、叢山峻嶺、進可戰、退可守、延長白山一帶皆爲天然險處於三月初旬、該軍曾攻牛心台車站、兵士奮勇、作戰結果甚佳、俘獲站長一名、活擒日人七名、日巡捕三名當時梒决、並奪得大槍六支、小槍三支、輕機關槍六架、劉係敎育界人、其所組之隊伍、對於民間、秋毫不擾、民頗同情、且隨時接濟軍需、該軍將來之成就、殊未可限量也、</p>
<p>（四）遼北方面地臨熱河、素爲多匪之區、東北事變以後、亦不乏綠林豪傑、從事抗日救國、據最近報告、小白龍滿天紅等、率衆約八九千人、紆迴通遼西北、於四月二十三日破壞通遼鄧家屯之一部、聲勢浩大、如能奪得通遼、扼駐泗洮路線則瀋陽長春、均危急矣、</p>
<p>槪觀遼寗各地義軍之活動、在本年一月初錦州退出之際、可謂極盛時期繼因彈盡援絕、各地義軍紛紛解體、石安全金德暄等綏中之役、雖予日人以若干損失、而石金兩部、皆潰不成軍、東北民衆抗日救國會所委任之二十餘司令、能統率其隊伍者、殆不得十之一二、然各路之分子、則仍然健存、並未消滅、大都各尋途徑、或埋藏於民團山林之間、另圖結合、或則混入日本旗幟之下、待時而動、其尙有人統率之義軍、一方與民衆結納、一方與日本收編之隊伍、暗送秋波、幾令降軍首領、防止無術、日軍最近派于芷山部四出抄匪、（指義勇軍）所過閭閻、則鷄犬不驚、眞是日人夢想不到之太平景象、蓋抄匪（義勇軍）者、因不願與匪爲敵、每到一處、或取得殘槍數支以　責、或　得餽送若干以自肥、蓋受命剿匪者、旣皆爲中國人、且彼等過去皆有相當關係誰肯爲日本去匪求治、此層日人未嘗不知、但知之亦無法耳、在另一方面、日本旣實行集團移民、又處處予人民以痛苦、人民因懷恨日深、殺敵之念日强、各地抗戰情况、近雖似乎衰落、實則正在醞釀、且益趨深　化、一量爆發、其勢不可當矣、</p>

<p>▲大多數主張聯美反日</p>
<p>▲甚且認日爲英國大敵</p>
<p>大阪每日新聞記者蘇峰生、評論英國對日態度云、最近英國對日政策、可分爲三種、（一）該國有極少數分子、以爲日英同盟斷絕、頗爲遺憾、如國民評論之主筆馬克司哈米爾登將軍等、主張親日、（二）大多數人的心理、皆主張聯美、以爲唯一的國策、自世界大發後、無論何事、惟追隨美國反對日本爲對外最宜之方針、因此親美遠日之議論、遍布全國、（三）認日本爲英國之大敵、揭破日本嗾使印度新嘉坡等土民、攪亂英領殖民地之陰謀、並謂一旦日美兩　發生事故、日必占領英領哥倫比亞、而爲其策源地、且日本原具有絕大的野心、將來企圖併吞中國四百餘州、對於英國在華商業根本上、必爲其摧殘無遺、再進而埀涎澳洲、英國爲排除障碍計、亟須與美協力同心、以制禦此世界之　、此派鼓吹最著者、如四月號之ＮineteefhCenturyandAfter論文中、前泰晤士報主筆WichhamSteed氏、發表「太平洋國之政策」其排斥日本、頗爲猛烈、恰與已故諾司克利夫卿晚年懷抱世界一週同樣之意見、彼二人前後如出一轍、由此觀之、我國民（日本）應認識英國之對日政策、實爲我國民所極憂慮者也、</p>

<p>▲又漲八兩二錢</p>
<p>▲買氣沸騰空户痛抵昨日金市仍祗半天、標金漲風益厲、趨勢敏捷、自晨至午竟有十四兩迴顧、其間大漲小回、早市見挫、蓋以銀市略跌、並因日俄形勢惡化、又傅歐戰債事可望展期也、以上消息、足使金價低落、其後突呈高峰、忽聞有大宗現金運輸出口、又某銀行一再開進、至於外滙、明暗皆緊、遂引起人心堅俏各號買氣沸騰一般空方忍痛抵進、市價大有直衝九霄之勢、已透出七百四十兩大關之新價矣鋒利無比終則猛漲八兩有零、茲將前市詳况紀后、</p>
<p>▲晨開一度見挫自早開六月份即跌九錢、爲七右卅六兩、雖大條加落十六分之三、銀價僅跌八分之一、私電只小十六分之一、故不以爲動、次又跌至卅五兩半、裕和·元茂永略進、即加至卅七兩、然滙票不緊以美金六月期卅元○四三七五、出入均可兼之恒餘·丙興·日昌等出售、迨九點時爲卅四兩左右、掛牌未更、旋由大連帮及社昌等買進、當爲卅六兩三錢、倐忽間傅聞戰債展期、將來或可以銀還償同時又訊日俄有接觸等風說、以此同太昌·志豐永·恒餘·兆豐昌等均有傾售、乃價一瀉四兩零、卒爲卅二兩、</p>
<p>▲傅某銀行吸現運外至後因聞某銀行又買現貨且有大批之數放洋、塲内買者始見活動、計福昌·永豐·恒昌永·福泰亨·鴻康永·萬興·開泰等欣欣而購、更以華比吸七月英金八七五、又進美金六二五、旣而益挺、故價扶搖直上、飛漲八兩有餘、將至十點時爲四十兩○七錢、惟志豐永·同太昌·又出不怠、當遜一兩餘、爲卅九兩、未幾時外滙尤緊近期美金僅計卅元邊境、福昌·順利·永豐·恒餘·乾昌祥·鴻康永·大德成等踴躍爭購、一刹時復衝出四十兩、又傅說中日停戰會議已簽定、人心尤定、自十點至十一點時共漲五兩、爲四十四兩、一小時中上落無幾、只有二兩光景、比由零户多頭售出、銳落二兩半、爲四十一兩半、旋因滙豐掛牌更縮一檔、計英金二五、美金三七五、當即哄至四十五兩、内盤更堅、本月美金對做八七五、旣而英金祇結六二五至六八七五、十一點半恒餘·乾昌祥售出、退爲四十三兩、　角</p>
<p>▲出現四十六兩新價復以恒興·恒餘·萬興等努力而進、且空頭續補不已、因之大受刺激、已出現四十六兩新價、殆美金近期廿九元七五、英金一七六二五、迨午收四十五兩一錢、較前午又漲八兩二錢、按前市最大四十六兩、最小卅二兩、計有十四兩迴顧、揭價初爲八百兩如前、計撳六十四五兩至六十八兩、後爲五十六七兩、旋因改爲八百十兩、計撳六十四五兩、登賬補水同爲四十五兩、赤條計加五兩、</p>

<p>昨英美匯兌回升、美英僅亦微漲、匯豐初次掛牌英美香港等匯悉無更動、祗惟印德各升二五法郎加一元、迨十一點一刻忽已改縮一檔、計英金二五、現爲一先令七便十半、美金三七五、爲廿九元六二五、港匯仍爲七十六兩六二五、印匯改小一元半、法郎十元、德匯减一元七五、和洋小去七五、坡洋加一兩七錢五、以此金價飛　騰達、已穿出七百四十兩大關、殆銀行成交價、自晨尙平、旋後頻緊、而美金竟已破進卅元之内、鋒俏無比、結果比前午縮六二五、英金亦縮三一二五、華商交易並不活動、實乃市况過昻、不易應手、計英金約成交四五萬鎊、金號略扒、惟孟買電售七月份、又美金共計三四十萬元、各號稍賣、而銀行亦有對做者、美銀公司脫售本月份、下午停市、</p>
<p>▲英匯内盤半日間有二五迴顧、自早市賣價一先令七便士八七五、買價九三七五、午收賣出價六二五、買價六八七五、掉期似乎捋平、</p>
<p>▲美匯内盤早午間有六八七五迴顧、近遠期相差一八七五至二五、比上週似見接攏、自早開賣價五月三十元○四三七五、六月半元、七月五六二五、八月六二五、買價五六二五至七五、午收賣價五月廿九元七五、六月八一二五、七月九三七五、八月三十元、買價廿九元八七五至三十元一二五、又掛牌一元、初仍合銀三兩三錢三分三三、午時改爲三兩三錢七分五五五、</p>

<h3 id="c134">厘市漸覺起色 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲市塲概况昨日洋厘形勢、格外堅昻人必　爲起色　目前情景、確引起各業商人大好興趣劑對於業務上之進展、有加無已、而銀洋用途、於以　繁、惟銀欵因總結賬期未過、（五月底）尙受金融界箝制、未能伸舒、然已扯　自如、不若從前之捉襟見肘也、</p>
<p>▲厘拆價格「洋厘」早市厘價因人心大好、頓時激漲四厘有半、已有七錢零九厘、午市改小一毫二忽半、爲七錢零八厘八毫忽半、結果二日中竟漲八九厘之巨、甚矣市面之轉機也、「銀拆」早午兩市統爲二分、劃頭始終白劃、因　襯過多、即白劃亦須推情收受云、</p>
<p>▲轉幣市情江南小洋、緣前日午市跌小過甚、故昨晨重行加昻、與前日早市相同、爲六錢一分一厘、午市勿動、交易早市五千角、午市二千角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢零五厘一毫半、午市爲六錢零五厘七毫半、結果較前日午市加漲二三厘、交易早市十六萬五千角、午市三萬角、銅元忽縮三千文爲四百十七千五百文、</p>
<p>▲銀洋進出「銀欵」銀行以下午依然春賽封關、故祇上午半天營業、而收解消息、外銀行覺略淡、計票欵收解一百二餕萬匯兌三十餘萬、貨欵六十餘萬、特欵一百餘萬、雜欵一百十餘萬、押滙欵四十餘萬、出倉六十萬、華商票欵收解二百二三十萬、各種關稅貨物匯兌洋雜各欵收解五百七八十萬、結欵二百餘萬、出倉四十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千二百餘萬、劃頭欵三百十餘萬、拆票交易二百餘萬、「洋欵」匯劃票欵早市做出一百十一萬、午市八十八萬、鈔票早市七萬五千、午市四萬、支單交易、早市十萬零五千、午市二萬五千、銀行買賣交易、早市八十萬午市六十五萬、各銀行洋户往來收解一百五十餘萬、鈔票進出一百三十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四百七十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百四十餘萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、本街需要七十餘萬、</p>

<h3 id="c143">復方君的一封書 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 佛·</p>
<p>自戰事發生後，本刊大受其影響，不得不暫時停止，近日雖已恢復，而投稿者已大異其趣，如文藝欄，自登載了陳柱尊夢苕厂主······諸先生的佳作後，新詩的投稿者甚少，而舊詩之投稿唱和者殊多，并有許多來書贊美，我見讀者歡迎，亦即以舊詩載入，仁者見仁，智者見智，在讀者旣各有所嗜·在編者原無容心於其間也，</p>
<p>惟有一點，谼與方君并讀者諸君商討的，就是詩當以舊的爲佳，抑係新的爲佳，當以有韵調的爲佳，抑以無韵調而隨便唱唱的爲佳，這個問題，曾經海内諸文豪，大打其筆墨官司·結果尙無具體的方案，不過我的主張，文字確以新的便當，－不能說佳－若云佳而言，新也有新的好處，舊也有舊的好處，惟有詩我主張以舊爲佳，因旣云文藝，天然當有些藝術化，决非隨便唱唱可以爲詩，</p>
<p>若云古典主義·不合近代潮流，其實古典主義－不但現在－就是從前也與潮流不合，所謂李杜之詩，老嫗能解，若當古典，則老嫗如何能解呢，就是明朝唐荊川，滿淸袁子才等等，亦多主張性學，少用古典，惟不得已爲文字上便利與藝術上工雅起見，偶一用之，不能稱爲主義也，若云祇顧民衆，不管藝術，那末本刊何必物闢文藝一欄呢，大凡做人每有不能直情逕行的地方，做文章亦有這樣的一個難處，余雖未識足下之面，（這裏我本想用識荊二字來代表，又恐怕被你駡我用古典來硬送進去，就此不敢，）但觀足下來書的措詞，及其舉動看來，想必是一位對於社會情形與學術方面，尙未經過一番洗禮的靑年，</p>
<p>至於科學間，老實說我國比較各國，的確是一種最貧乏最幼穉的一種學問，刻下尙在科學智識的販賣時代，不過販賣旣多，自會有創造者應運而起，現在我國麵包問題，大起　慌，大的事業，不容易去建設，因此本刊的主張，是要提倡一般小工藝，小科學，希望人生需用的物品，完全用國貨，至於輪船鐵路飛機炸彈等等，自有政府要人來想法，我們可以不管，祇因爲此次戰爭，吳淞閘北等處的慘狀，全係敵人大砲飛機炸彈所賜，故近日本刊往往登載這樣類似的科學，只爲國人受了這種的痛苦，還是莫名其妙，所以登載出來，使大家知道飛機的構造與炸彈的怎樣厲害而已，這種應時品的科學，我認爲民衆雖不能製造，但是民衆也不妨曉得一些，亦未爲不可，不能謂其離大衆太遠，而絕對無登載之價値也，</p>
<p>我回顧頭來，又要同幾位投稿的科學家說一說，以後如賜給稿件，請不要寄水是什么香氣是什么······一類的稿件，請寄那樣東西的原料，是鹽或是松香或是蛋白質做成的，做成那樣東西，是用怎樣的手續和方法，如寄這類的稿件，本刊更是歡迎，因與本刊提倡小工藝的宗旨頗合也，</p>
<p>唉編輯本刊眞是困難極了，第一件就是地位狹窄，不能盡量登載，第二件要配讀者的味口，所謂「公要餛飩婆要麵」，配了公的味口，就不配了婆的味口，要使社會上讀報的先生們，口味多對，怎樣辦得到呢，我想起了外國敎科書上，有父子兩人同牽驢子的一件古事，結果使這驢子死在河中，可見天下事，安得人人而悅了，不過盡我心之所安而已，</p>
<p>此外附帶敬告投稿的諸位同志，稿文請愈短愈妙，至多不得過五百字，假定不用，一槪不退還，因投稿者每日有數十封之多，手續頗麻煩，並另苦衷，容俟後日再達，</p>

<p>— ·柳祺·</p>
<p>現在坐飛機的人，雖覺得旅行迅速，但是總時刻提心吊膽地怕飛機失了事，萬一跌落地來，可就性命交關，所以航空的不容易發展，這一點安全問題，也大有關係，據路透社的消息，有一位法國工程師名亞爾培蘇望者，（AlbetSauvant）發明一種保險鋼箱，裝在飛機中，可以免除危險，他在上月二十六日實地試騐，把他的飛機升到五百呎高度時，有意撞碎在山旁崖石上，飛機轉了六個筋斗，全部跌碎在地上，當時亞爾培就從飛機中爬出，指示嚇呆的觀衆，飛機中的保險鋼箱，一點没有損害。</p>
<p>他這一次的試騐，並没有得到法國當道的許可，是私下做的，現在他請求准他在三千呎高度上再試騐一次，從前他曾用過模型飛機試跌過幾次，飛機中帶有小羊頭和雞蛋若干，因保險鋼箱的保護，跌下時都没有損壞，將來飛機上若都裝有這種保險鋼箱，那末航空旅行不但迅速，而且安全了。</p>
<p>豈有此理</p>

<p>一天下午，Ｃ君在路上碰着了他的朋友Ｚ君，</p>
<p>「老Ｚ，這幾天怎麽樣？覺得懨氣嗎？」</p>
<p>「懨氣！怎樣不懨氣？没法想呀！」</p>
<p>「······游戲塲逛逛嗎？影氣院呢？跳舞塲？······」</p>
<p>「不！一處都没有去過！現在是什麽時候？國難臨頭！那裏還有心思去尋開心！」Ｚ君正色的對Ｃ君說，表示於國家担着非常的憂心·</p>
<p>『哈！人心早已死了！中國人那裏肯掙氣！「五分鐘熱度」！早已給人家笑煞了！什麽「國難」不「國難」，中國人祇配做「奴」！哈哈！老Ｚ，白相相有甚麽要緊呢？』</p>
<p>三天後，在一家ＸＸＸ影戲院門口，Ｃ君又過見了他的朋友Ｚ君··那時影戲剛剛散塲·</p>
<p>「喲！老Ｚ，往那裏去吓？」</p>
<p>「······」Ｚ君呆住了，面上有點慚愧！</p>
<p>「你在······」Ｃ君很驚奇·</p>
<p>「看影戲！」Ｚ君勉强裝作着不經意的樣子··「今天的影片很不差！」</p>
<p>「吚？你不是曾經說······」</p>
<p>「是啊！國難時期！我們本不應該作樂！但是，你看看上海的景像，還像是「國難時期」麽？「五分鐘熱度」亦算已過了！腦子裏的影象亦已漸漸地淡忘了！自然，要我一個人掙什麽氣？就是掙氣，亦是没用，哈，哈，樂得大家去逛逛！散散心！」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈！······」</p>
<p>「密司脫Ｃ我們一道上ＸＸＸ蕃菜館去吧！然後再到跳舞塲去！我請客！······」</p>
<p>「·············」</p>

<h3 id="c148">求婚呢編照呢 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— ·金煥·</p>
<p>「某世家子也，曾畢業高中·現任職某機關，月入頗豐，茲得家長同意，廣事求婚·爰登報章，籍徵情侶·凡願意女士·請附最近照片·及詳細履歷·投函本報某號信箱可也」·</p>
<p>在半個月前的某報上，刊載着上面的一段廣告，這不打緊，却引起了難得看報的某女士注意，</p>
<p>她現在充着小學敎員，她感覺着靑春的將要老去，所以很急於的需要她的伴侶，平時因爲她的條件太苛，因此便一年一年的拖下來，到如今還没有相當的人物，現在看見這樣的一段廣告，怎不認爲「時乎不再」呢？因此便偷偷摸摸的把照片履歷寄出去，還附了幾句纏綿悱惻，嚶嚶求友的話兒，</p>
<p>第三天的下午，她接到了黏着一分郵花用打官機打出來的一封信，牠的話，是；</p>
<p>「接誦芳函，莫名雀躍·惟某此次徵婚·大都在健康方面着想，芳容婀娜多姿，極符某之條件，惟面部表情，殊不足代表全身之健康，爰奉復書，敬希女士於一星期内，將胸腹腿等部，各予以特殊姿勢，彙集寄下，（片後並望正式簽字用杜假冒）庶幾白頭偕老，遺憾永無，想女士亦深表同情也（下略）」</p>
<p>健康麽？那倒配胃口了，記得前年全市運動會裏，她也參加過，結果，雖比不上ＸＸＸ，却也壓倒了不少女傑，現在他果眞要一個「健而美」的女子，她或者還有獲選的希望了，她很欣慰的，毫不猶豫的，像在游泳池畔的照片，一連拍了好多張，盛以錦盒，鄭重的寄去</p>
<p>她鎭天價想，鎭天價念，越想越念，越念越幻，她自信的說，這件事，一定可以成功，一定不會落選，况且又幻想着他洋意對方的體格，或許他也是一個運動家，那麽，將來在健身房裏，游泳池中越發的有味兒，趣兒，她這樣地胡思幻想，簡直險些兒把她發獃，</p>
<p>呀！洪喬失誤了麽？怎的快一星期了，還没有接到他的回信，她等得不耐煩，便接連的寫信去間，可是憑你一封一封的出去，那邊終是一些一些也不來，她惱了，就再寫信去責問，果然，來了，</p>
<p>「尊示及玉照都到，茲某已徵得Ｘ女士同意，即日訂婚，有負盛情，曷勝抱罪」</p>
<p>氣得說不出話來，在她看了這封寥寥數十字的便紙條後，</p>
<p>求婚呢？騙照呢？</p>
<p>就成了她最後的疑問；</p>
<p>乱道</p>

<p>— ·蓓蕾·</p>
<p>春雨疏疏地打着窗，氣壓很覺沉悶，ＸＸ女校的宿舍裏，已經熄了火，一般姑娘們各自在溫軟窩中找尋甜夢，然而春的雨夜，使姑娘的心坎裏感受空虛而不安，無聊地，又起了任意的談話·</p>
<p>女生，特别是高中的女生，漫漫的長夜，都喜懽無意識地用談話消磨時光，可是無意識的談話中，却又有很多的神秘的意味存在，</p>
<p>这一間宿舍，靠近校圓，雖是下着雨，花香依然陳陳的襲人鼻觀，錢小姐的床舖，是倚着窗的，細雨灑在葉上，使她尋夢不成，於是她首先發言，呌着對床的璇，</p>
<p>「喂，你睡着了没有？再繼續講你逃難出來時過見敵兵擄人的故事啊，」　　璇，這時本憧憬着逃難時的痛史，還没睡着，當時便帶着羞怒的音調，向錢小姐說「這種侮辱的行爲，說出來很難以爲情，總之，吾們無抵抗的女性，無法能彀抵抗的，」</p>
<p>「那没，你當時是怎樣脫避的？」</p>
<p>「不要說哩，怪羞的·」</p>
<p>蘋和英，這時也正扺聲地在評論某的愛人是怎樣，而某的未婚夫又如何？······一間四個人，成爲二對的對話着·</p>
<p>璇聽見英高興地還是以前般腐化的討論着，想起滬戰未啓時，英是怎樣地慷慨激昻的到處演講，不禁體味到自身的遭險，而根本顯露她的矛盾·於是喚着英，訓斥似地說「勇毅精神，經了砲聲便消散嗎？你以前不是說的：殺敵的英雄，要求接吻都可以·現在英雄確產生了，接吻見諸事實嗎？失地之下，竟會這般消極！」</p>
<p>「英，平素以辯倫見長的英，那裏受得下這種話？當塲就還她顔色，她說「我消極嗎？我恐懼嗎？不恐懼的人，見了敵兵便那樣狼狽，還說什麽消極，積極，」</p>
<p>這些話，好似替璇加了爆發物的油，說「不能和敵拚命，爲了没有槍，世界上决没白白犠牲而有價値的·但我終算親身過到國難，至少强如你只會說空話·」</p>
<p>「我只會說空話，是的，不知說實話的人，也曾實現過嗎？</p>
<p>「這是强辯，根本不合羅輯·」</p>
<p>雙方爭辯，已至焦點，蘋和錢小姐，守中立，也不說話，也不調解，爲的錢小姐和璇要好些，而蘋是傾向於英的·</p>
<p>正閙得不開交的時候，玻窗上拍拍的三下，「熄燈後不准說話！」分明是舍監的聲音·</p>
<p>於是，一幕無意識中有意識的辯倫，告了一段落，只有疎疎的雨，依然打着花枝·</p>

<p>昨日開映於南京大戲院之「幽蘭涙史」，爲一空前悲艶巨片，主角伊麗莎蘭第，其表情於「靈肉之愛」及「黃執照」二片中諒爲觀者所鑒賞，無待庸述，今於該片中，飾一少女，其夫所愛匪人，自嘆命薄，然以護夫之故，不惜赴湯蹈火以救之，以致身入囹圄，而產期又屆，所產之嬰孩，復爲人携去，母子骨肉分離，痛心極矣，後雖用盡千計百方，始將嬰孩領還，但以拐騙罪，重再入獄，伊麗莎蘭第之表演，較前數片更深切，一舉一動，銘人心肺，配角麥克勞倫，表演傑出，其餘演員，個個出力異常，誠足有觀價値之佳片也，</p>

<h3 id="c154">福特小車　虞· <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲在英國製造</p>
<p>不列顛汽車業中。近來盛行一種小汽車。所謂「孩兒」車者是也。此種小型汽車。其外形固較普通汽車爲小。即其汽缸馬力。亦無不隨之而具减。英國對於汽車抽稅。每年例以車身之馬力計算。故邇來一般汽車駕駛者。爲求經濟起見。大多　大而趨小。且「孩兒」車者。不僅納稅爲輕。即其一切駕駛上之費用。因引擎小。馬力减。莫不有連帶關係。而能减少車主之負担。此外則更有一端足爲購置汽車者之取擇。即其售價能較一般汽車爲低廉也。職是之故。英國之小型汽車乃風行一時。各汽車製造廠莫不悉心研究。以求小型汽車之發展。因之英倫所舉行之汽車展覧會中。「孩兒」車之陳列乃佔其大部矣。</p>
<p>福特汽車在英行銷向具一部份之優勢。在英設有支廠。出品衆多。舉與英貨互爭一日之長。近因發展業務力趨風尙起見。已在英創製一種福特小型汽車。據倫敦來訊·此項小車具有八匹馬力。式樣優美。使用經濟。可與目下盛行之良佳小車。互相頡頏。預料此車問世之日。英國汽車界中。當又有一番盛况也。</p>
<p>「孩兒」福特車之第一個模型。係在美國所製造。完全用人工計劃加以配製。當其橫斷大西洋。送往英倫之時。絕對保守秘密。此車於二月十九日在倫　敦阿爾白大廳陳列。開始與英倫人士作最初之相見禮。</p>
<p>新車引擎具有汽缸四隻。其大小爲二·二三英寸乘六·六四英寸。可生馬力七·九六匹。依照此種馬力計算。常年納稅爲八鎊。汽缸之頭可以分離。係整座式。其小半部則與曲軸箱併鑄。汽門係用上等絡鋼所製。其他引擎裝置。莫不精益求精。車之輪距爲七尺六英寸。轍長三尺八英寸。</p>
<p>關於此福特小車之價格。成本方面之計算。於短時期内不能草率算出。故當新車陳列以供衆覧之晨。車之售價。尙不能明以告人。最後正式之售價始行公佈。兩門轎車計售英金一百二十鎊。此外尙有四門轎車。不久亦將問世。</p>
<p>福特小型車之製作旣極精美。車身寛暢。又爲特色中之一。此車最後座身地位。均極舒暢。而尤以後廂爲甚。人座其中。兩足極感舒適。無展轉不寗之苦。上方地位更爲寛裕。雖以六尺之軀。頭載冠帽。亦可以昻然而坐。毫無不適之覺。故出入車座動作便疾。駕駛者有左右安適之感。其他設備因車身低小。當然不能包羅衆多。而力求簡省。但仍有燃料量表一具。變速桿之地位。裝製頗爲適當。手扳制車機之地位。雖若較遠。然實際上。不過作爲停車之制動而已。</p>
<p>此車之發電機裝於引擎與車架之間。地位甚低。不易鐲及。但線圈塞及配電器等裝置之處。尙稱便利。故外觀亦佳。凡上所述均係此項新式小型車之大槪情形福特之以小車問世。在其製車歷程中。實爲一重大之變化。而上述小車之作風爲一種英國式之表樣。故其意義尤爲重要。福特初造之車爲二十四匹馬力之Ａ模型者。其次則爲較小之十四·九匹馬力者。其後續有更易。力趨時勢之要求。降至最近而有小車之行世。考其原因。不外購買者因經濟之關係而已。惟福特對於大車之製造仍舊努力前進。至於此次八匹馬力之小型車前途銷路如何。一時固不敢必。但就其製作之精美。低廉之售價。及羣衆之需要而言。當亦不難暢銷。而盛行一時也。</p>

<p>愛斯東君。今已雅負時望矣。溯愛君於去年二月十六日。曾駕一引擎不足七五零西西之英國車。作五基羅邁當之駛行。其速率竟達每小時一零三·一三英里。厥後復作十英里之駛行。並能保持此每小時逾百英里之速度。而以平均每小時一零一·八六英里之成績。突破以前最高紀錄焉。按以不足七五零西西之引擎。而能造成每小時逾百英里之速率者。實以君爲第一人。至君所乘者。美琪牌汽車也。（（Ｍ·Ｇ·Ｍidget）世之從事於搆製所謂小號汽車者。希冀其出品有此成績。已非朝夕。然而如願以酬。克告成功者。除美琪車外。絕無僅有也。雖今後汽車方面之進步。未可限量。但美琪此項成績。固已難能可貴而至足稱矣。及至去年十月十七日。愛爾德君。復駕七五零西西之美琪車。作五基羅邁當之駛行。其速度且達每小時一一零·二八英里。斯蓋與唐克翼君。駕英國小姐第二無輪之航行速率。正相等也。</p>
<p>考美琪汽車公司之歷史。殊覺饒有興趣。蓋以個人之熱忱與毅力。佐以總理之贊助與同情·遂克突飛猛進。而躋於今日之地位。按在七年以前。猶無所謂美琪車也。但旋即一鳴驚人。作異常之活躍。呈長足之進展焉。茲特以其成功始未。略述如次。儻亦讀者所樂聞歟。</p>
<p>初馬律斯君。（今已尊稱爲韋廉馬律斯爵士矣）除在可萊城置有偉大而蒸蒸日上之製造廠外。並在奥斯福。置有一二汽車行。主管之者。爲薛雪爾吉伯君。吉伯君　曾精造機器脚踏車。務求其盡美盡善。彌臻迅速。及旣獲得管理汽車製造事宜之機會。爰即以其對於機脚車精益求精之精神。實旋於汽車。力請於主者。願以全力從事於彼時盛行之圓鼻形馬律斯奥斯福汽車之改善工作。藉使其速度。得以駕其餘馬律斯車而上之焉。此種手工精造之汽車。第一年出產量。雖僅六輛。然而此後一切偉大計劃之成功。與馬律師圓鼻形水箱之一變而爲今日之長方式。即皆基於斯。至於吉伯君努力之結果。厥爲美琪牌新車之克告成功。别出心裁。獨樹一幟。自有其逈不可及之特色。</p>
<p>此後循序改良。彌復精神。及至距今兩年前。復以機綠凑巧。購得一最完美最新式之製造廠。而新公司亦於是乎組成。仍以吉伯君主管之。至於韋廉爵士。自仍爲其有力後盾。新公司規模旣宏。設備益週。而各式新車。亦遂先後問世焉。總計該廠所製美琪車。式樣共三種。即十七·七匹假定馬力之六缸式美琪車。與八匹假定馬力美琪車。及特號美琪車是也。槪括言之。美琪車之設計與搆製。蓋皆以「速度高於一切。」與「安全迅速。」二者爲鵠的。宜其成續優異。爲世人所熱烈歡迎也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The May Fourth Movement and Youth by Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Thirteen years ago - today in the eighth year of the Republic (1919). The great May Fourth Movement was unfolding its glorious prelude in Beijing.</p>
<p>The "May Fourth Movement" was not accidental. Its emergence had historical and contemporary backgrounds. It was a new era for youth. This new era negated the "Hundred Days' Reform" of the late Qing Dynasty, propelling China's new intellectual trends into a new stage. But soon it was negated by the "May Thirtieth Movement" itself.</p>
<p>Ever since the Opium War, the encroachment and oppression of international imperialism had long sown the seeds for the May Fourth Movement in China. When the World War I ended in 1919, capitalism had not yet embarked on the "second period" -- that is, the path of "industrial recovery." The people's aversion to war caused by the Great War had also erupted in revolutions attempting to overthrow the old social system and permanently eliminate war. Such revolutionary movements occurred in Germany, Russia, and Hungary. And the new Russia was born from the ruins of the old Russia at that time. China felt the impact of this trend. At the same time, during the European war, Japan's ultimatum forcing the conclusion of the Twenty-One Demands gave the Chinese people an unbearable stimulus, deeply feeling the pain of being shackled by unequal treaties. Looking at the Beijing government itself at that time, it no longer had the power to rule the whole country. A new force -- the Kuomintang, representing revolutionary forces -- was thriving under the old ruling forces. Thus, the international situation led to the domestic political turmoil and the people's inability to withstand the oppression of imperialism, resulting in the idea of seeking national liberation and generating the motive for the May Fourth Movement. When the Paris Peace Conference opened, in order to overturn the treasonous treaty, the young students in Beijing took the lead on May 4th to punish a group of national traitors. This sound of the bell immediately awakened the responses from mountains and seas all over the country, and the glorious May Fourth Movement unfolded.</p>
<p>Immediately following the May Fourth Movement, the revolutionary thought quickly transformed into the new culture thought. The new literary style replaced the old literary style, and Western European culture was accepted as much as possible, breaking the prejudice of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for practical application". The most characteristic thing of this era was that various isms and theories were introduced to China at this time. Every young person was pursuing their ideals until the "May Thirtieth Movement". The ideological struggle then changed into a struggle of action. Therefore, the "May Fourth Movement" truly retains the glory of "epoch-making" in the historical chapter of our country.</p>
<p>The true value of the May Fourth Movement does not lie in its mode of operation, but in its accurate grasp of the contemporary trend of thought. Now, it is no longer the May Fourth era of thirteen years ago. This is no longer the era of strikes, marches, posting slogans, shouting slogans, and petitioning. Grasping the tides of the times, standing at the forefront of the times, and dedicating oneself to promoting the times. This is the lesson that young people today should recognize and grasp about "May Fourth," and it is also the mission that young people today should shoulder.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Guo Taiqi Was Beaten and Bleeding Yesterday Morning <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>People's Representatives Aroused by Patriotic Righteousness</p>
<p>Copper Coins and Other Objects Threw and Injured Mr. Guo's Head</p>
<p>Minister Song and Various Envoys Rushed to Console</p>
<p>Eleven Arrested, Two Released on Bail</p>
<p>Guo Taiqi, the chief representative of our side at the ceasefire conference, was injured in the head by representatives of certain groups throwing copper coins and teacups when he met with representatives of popular organizations at 9:20 yesterday morning, causing a lot of bleeding from his left cheek. Afterwards, the French police learned of the incident and immediately dispatched detectives to suppress it and arrested eleven people. Yin Zhiling and Li Cishan, representatives of various associations, were released on bail by Mr. Guo after being arrested, while the others are still in custody. Mr. Guo's injuries are currently being treated by doctors and are expected to heal in about ten days. However, the ceasefire conference will not be affected by this and can continue to be held. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲The Course of the Assault Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, the representatives Yin Zhiling, Li Cishan, Xie Chengping, Yang Rongwei, etc., from the National Salvation Joint Association of various groups, went to the Foreign Affairs Office to pay respects to Deputy Minister Guo Taiqi. Because Deputy Minister Guo was not there, they changed to Mr. Guo's private residence at No. 2 Laoliyu Road to seek an audience. At that time, Mr. Guo and Dai Ji and Huang Qiang were gathered at home preparing to attend the ceasefire conference. Because the Japanese instruction had not arrived, the meeting could not be held. British Minister Lampson notified Mr. Guo by telephone. Guo then informed Dai and Huang. Dai and Huang were about to leave when the representatives Yin and other four representatives of the various associations submitted their cards and requested an audience. Mr. Guo was quite familiar with Yin and others because they often came to inquire about all diplomatic issues, so he personally extended an audience. Yin and others initially asked Guo whether he admitted that Chinese troops were not allowed to be stationed in the areas south of the Suzhou River and Pudong. Mr. Guo immediately replied that it was not that troops were not stationed there, but only that our troops would not be transferred temporarily during the Japanese withdrawal. Yin and others also asked Mr. Guo to announce the ceasefire agreement, which he also agreed to. At 8:30, representatives of the Mass Organizations Joint Association, He Jingmin, Ni Yibao, Wu Muxi, Shen Zuru, and others, and representatives of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Joint Association of university students, Lin Zuyu and others, also arrived at Guo's residence, requesting the announcement of the contents of the draft agreement. Around 9 o'clock, more than 20 student representatives followed. Deputy Minister Guo [I&gt;Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi&lt;I]</p>
<p>Announced the Chinese agreement, and the public requested that the English agreement and its attachments be fully announced. Also agreed. Mr. Guo took out the English draft agreement and read it. When reading to the eleventh article, a certain representative stepped forward and took the English draft agreement down, tore it up and threw it to the ground. Several people attacked Mr. Guo with copper coins and teacups, causing Mr. Guo's left forehead to be injured and blood covering his face.</p>
<p>▲Another Report Yesterday morning at 8:30, representatives Yin Zhiling, Li Cishan, and other four representatives of the National Salvation Joint Association of various groups, had already met with Mr. Guo in the living room of Guo's residence. Mr. Guo said that there was a misunderstanding outside, and that Songnan and Pudong were also included in the negotiations. This matter cost a lot of negotiations and was understood by the ministers of various countries. Absolutely not included in the agreement. You can rest assured, I have nothing to hide. Then a gentleman asked to read the draft. Guo agreed. At the same time, more than a dozen representatives entered the living room one after another. Guo took the Chinese draft from the room and spread it on the round table for everyone to read. Unexpectedly, when reading to the second item of the outline, there were peculiar and frightening words, which were unexpectedly exposed. The words were "Stop the hostile acts around Shanghai," and the question was raised, (1) The fact of hostile acts only exists in Huben, why is it included in the surrounding area, which is obviously contradictory to Guo's statement that Songnan Pudong is not included in the negotiations, (2) The scope of the surrounding area of Shanghai is unlimited, There has been no hostile act in Hunan and Pudong, why is it necessary to declare a cessation, (4) Does the hostile act include all anti-Japanese work and boycotting Japanese goods, etc., Guo replied, "Don't quarrel, this is irrelevant", and then read down to the fourth article, there were also places where both sides withdrew and it was difficult to explain. Therefore, the question was raised, "Where will our troops withdraw to," Guo replied, "There is a proviso under this article, and the principle was established when the 19th Route Army had not withdrawn, so it only retains the face of the 19th Route Army". At that time, the representatives seemed very angry, but had no other indication. However, a certain representative read the original English draft from Guo Su again. Guo then went into the room to take out a piece of paper and asked Dai Ji to explain the text. More than 20 representatives stood around the table and asked Guo, "How exactly should the surrounding area of Shanghai be explained," Guo replied, "Don't be picky, I have done my best, this is beneficial," the representatives were furious, saying that this draft was absolutely impossible, Guo replied, "I am responsible for not losing power and humiliating the country," at this point, they all raised their voices and asked, "How will Guo take responsibility first," At this point, conflicts arose between the words, and the order was slightly unsettled.</p>
<p>▲Many Arrested Deputy Minister Guo was injured in the head, and the doctors said that he would be fully recovered in two weeks. Yesterday morning, the French police heard the news and immediately dispatched a large number of police to suppress it. The crowd was arrested inside and outside Guo's residence. There were a total of eleven people, including Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Tian Yuqi, Ni Shichang, Fan Xueqin, Jiang Yizhi, Jiang Yongda, Wu Gonghan, Shen Zuru, Yang Ruiwei, and Xie Chengping. Among them, Li Cishan and Yin Zhiling were only detained in the French police station for two hours and were released on bail by Mr. Guo. The other nine people were still detained in the special room of the French police station last night.</p>
<p>▲Treatment Requires Days After Mr. Guo was injured, the blood on his left forehead did not stop flowing. Mrs. Guo Xu Dequan immediately used electricity to invite the German doctor Miali to treat him at home. At the same time, Huang Qiang also invited a Chinese doctor to bring a female nurse to Mr. Guo's residence for treatment. The western doctor applied medicine and bandaged the wound, and then the bleeding stopped. Mr. Guo's wound was just above his left eyebrow, there were two places in total, one place was about three or four points deep, and the other place was only two points. According to Dr. Miali, it will take ten days to two weeks to fully recover. The sofa in Mr. Guo's reception room and the clothes he was wearing were stained with blood. Afterwards, Mrs. Guo Xu Dequan handed over the bloody clothes and the copper coins picked up from the ground to the Lujiiawan police station for filing and future reference.</p>
<p>▲Visiting One After Another After the news of Deputy Minister Guo being beaten and injured was spread, British Minister Lampson first took Secretary Bai Bailakemin and Army Counselor Sharile, and American Minister Johnson also took Secretary Enjitu, and together arrived at Guo's residence at 12:15 to console him. Then Cuban Minister General Piede and Chilean Chargé d'affaires Baixila also went to Guo's residence to console him one after another, talking for about ten minutes. The Cuban Minister and Chilean Chargé d'affaires left first. The British and American envoys, in addition to consoling, also contacted the continuation of the meeting, so they were slightly delayed and left at 12:30. Then Italian Chargé d'affaires Qiano, together with French Military Counselor Palevite, also went to comfort Mr. Guo. In addition, those who went to Guo's residence to comfort him included Central Committee member Chu Minyi, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng at 3:40 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Guo Expressed Mr. Guo said that the injuries he suffered were minor and there was no major problem. According to his statement, the occurrence of this unfortunate incident was only due to the public's misunderstanding of the diplomatic authorities, but it was also driven by patriotism. I can deeply understand this, and I believe that the public's beating of me is by no means opposing the individual. After the Foreign Ministry Office received the news, it immediately reported the incident to the Nanjing Foreign Ministry, and said that the ceasefire conference would definitely not be suspended because of this.</p>
<p>▲Letters from Various Groups The National Salvation Joint Association of various groups sent representatives Yin Zhiling and Chen Yafu to comfort Mr. Guo at 3:00 pm yesterday. Here is the association's letter to Mr. Guo: Dear Sir, the representatives Li Cishan, Yin Zhiling, Xie Yongnian, and Yang Rongwei, who came to the meeting at 8:00 am today, visited you regarding the ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference, intending to inquire about everything in detail. At that time, we had already received your responsible reply, saying that you would rather die than accept such humiliating national terms. While talking, a large number of people caused a conflict when you announced the Chinese and English agreements, which was beyond the expectations of the representatives of our association. We hereby send a special letter of condolence, and respectfully ask you to continue to work hard for the country, which is fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Ceasefire Conference Was Not Held Yesterday <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>

<p>▲Both Sides Continued to Sort Out the Agreement Articles Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Someone Said That the General Assembly Could Reopen on Thursday</p>
<p>The ceasefire conference was originally scheduled to continue at 10:00 yesterday morning. However, because the Japanese side had not yet received the instructions from the Japanese military department regarding the decision on the issue of the defense area of our army south of the Suzhou River and Pudong, they requested a postponement of the meeting, so it was not held yesterday. However, yesterday afternoon, the Chinese, British and Japanese sides each sent a representative to continue the Agreement Article Sorting Committee, and had completed sorting out all the articles that had not been sorted out last time. It is now said that the meeting has been roughly scheduled to reopen tomorrow morning, and it is heard that it can be signed on the same day.</p>

The British Minister notified Deputy Minister Guo by telephone at 8:30. Mr. Guo was just at home meeting with Dai Ji and Huang Qiang, preparing to leave home to attend the meeting. After receiving the notification, he immediately stopped.</p>
<p>▲Reasons for Suspension The reason why the Japanese side requested the postponement of the general assembly was because the military department had not yet received instructions regarding the issue of the garrison south of the Suzhou River and Pudong decided by the small group meeting. The Japanese military department had a certain doubt about this issue yesterday morning and telegraphed Chief of Staff Tashiro to inquire. After replying to the telegram and explaining, it was heard that there was generally no problem.</p>
<p>▲Continued Meeting Tomorrow The meeting could still continue yesterday afternoon, but it was not held due to the beating of Deputy Minister Guo. At the same time, in order to quickly end the meeting, the British and American envoys, while consoling Mr. Guo yesterday afternoon, also agreed to first handle the full text of the agreement and the signing procedures outside the meeting, so that at the continued meeting, after a brief discussion, the agreement could be read and formally signed. According to someone, the meeting could have continued this afternoon, but it has now been decided to postpone it until Thursday tomorrow. Whether Mr. Guo can attend is unknown.</p>

Moreover, our representative Guo Taiqi was injured in the beating, and will not be able to attend the meeting in person, so both parties intend to have the attending representatives sign a draft agreement first, and then have the representatives of neutral countries and the attending persons of both parties formally sign it by the four military and diplomatic representatives of China and Japan.

<p>Article 10 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, making changes in the territorial sovereignty of our country and losing its integrity. The people of our country believe that there is no room for consideration of this proposal, and have made a clear statement to the representatives of our country. At the same time, we also hope that Your Excellency, who is mediating, will pay attention to this point, because this proposal hinders the territorial sovereignty of our country, goes beyond the scope of mediation, and is inconsistent with the Covenant of the League of Nations and its recent resolutions.

<h3 id="e4">Shanghai Citizens Concerned About Jiang and Cai's Resignation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>▲Jiang Went to Hangzhou for Sightseeing Yesterday</p>
<p>Recently, there was news that Jiang Guangnai of the 19th Route Army had resigned to the Central Government and went abroad. Recently, there was news that Cai Tingkai had also submitted his resignation. Although the ministers and division commanders of various departments tried their best to persuade him to stay, Jiang and Cai were still unknown. However, the people were quite surprised and suspicious after hearing the news. Because the country is still in trouble, and the 19th Route Army is trusted by the people of the country. It is on this army that the country's pillar relies. Therefore, various groups held meetings one after another. If the news is true, they will jointly ask the two gentlemen to work hard and not be negative. It is heard that the Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association has issued a telegram, the text of which is as follows,</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission of the Nanjing National Government, Minister He of the Ministry of Military Administration, Suzhou learned that Commander Jiang and Army Commander Cai of the 19th Route Army are all aware. It is reported that Commander Jiang resigned, and the government will approve it. Army Commander Cai will continue to resign, etc., and the roads are noisy. The public is shocked. This time, the 19th Route Army took the lead among the armies, bravely killed the enemy, fought hard for more than a month, attacked the many with the few, and resisted the strong with the weak, winning glory for the international community and creating ambition for all the people. A small part of Songhu and a large part of China are respecting its loyalty and regarding it as the Great Wall. But the strong enemy is still at the national gate, and the good general suddenly thinks of Gao Dao. For the sake of the future of defense, for the sake of the duty of soldiers, neither is appropriate. If this is the case, please Jiang and Cai do their duty and do not say goodbye again. Especially hope that the government will remember national defense and not approve it. The members of this association deeply feel that this matter is very important and dare not remain silent. A special telegram is submitted. If this is not the case, please give a quick telegram to dispel the rumors and appease the people. The Shanghai Citizens' Local Maintenance Association respectfully bows to Jiang, Commander Jiang Guangnai of the 19th Route Army, with four guards, took a car from the South Station to Hangzhou for sightseeing yesterday.</p>

<p>▲The Shrapnel in the Left Knee Has Not Yet Been Removed</p>
<p>▲Goto Said That the Right Foot Does Not Need to Be Amputated</p>
<p>▲Shirakawa, Ueda, etc. Have Improved Slightly</p>
<p>The Japanese government specially appointed Goto Shichiro, a medical doctor and authority in the surgical field, to come to Shanghai to treat Shigemitsu and others' injuries. He went to Fumin Hospital again yesterday morning for diagnosis, but was still unable to perform surgery and clamp out the shrapnel. Shigemitsu's body temperature rose and his condition did not improve. Shirakawa, Ueda, Murai, Nomura and others have not changed. Shigemitsu's brother Shigemitsu Tsuku arrived in Shanghai at 2:30 yesterday afternoon, while Shigemitsu's wife was recuperating in Osaka after giving birth and did not come to Shanghai yesterday. The details are as follows,</p>
<p>▲Shirakawa Ueda According to the Japanese Army Hospital yesterday, the conditions of Shirakawa and Ueda are as follows, (1) Commander Shirakawa, slight fever in the afternoon of the 2nd, fever subsided on the morning of the 3rd, pulse as normal, wound condition is good, eats wheat porridge, etc., and is in good spirits, (2) Division Commander Ueda, no fever since the 2nd, pulse as normal, in excellent spirits, wound condition is good,</p>

According to Goto's statement to Japanese reporters, the fractured part of Minister Shigemitsu's right tibia is swollen, so ice is used to cool it, and the result is good, the swelling is slightly reduced, and the heat is also reduced, the wound has no ulceration. The shrapnel deep in the opening of the left knee is currently waiting for it to float up automatically. As far as the current situation is concerned, there is no need to actively perform surgery. The rumor that the minister's right foot should be amputated is completely unfounded. Wait until tomorrow (i.e. the 4th) to take X-rays again, and study the location and depth of the shrapnel more deeply, and then try to remove it, Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 pm, Dr. Goto went to various hospitals to diagnose Shirakawa, Ueda, and Nomura's injuries,</p>

According to Shigemitsu Tsuku, Minister Shigemitsu's wife had just given birth and was unable to travel due to fatigue, so she is still recuperating in Osaka. If the injury worsens, she will rush here,</p>

<p>▲ Seven People Stabbed with Bayonets</p>
<p>▲ Shops on Both Sides Closed Early</p>
<p>Around 7:10 PM last night, in the Jiangyuan Lane area of Xin Zha Road, several armed Japanese soldiers suddenly crossed the Wuzhen Road Bridge from the north bank of the Suzhou Creek into the concession, stabbing seven Chinese people. The names of the injured are as follows: Tian Baoshan, from Shaoxing, an electrician, age 25, residing at 177 Siwen Lane, Xin Zha Road; Jiang A Jin, age 42, from Wuxi, a rice merchant, residing at 147 Lao Street, Xin Zha Bridge; Qi Guangming, age 33, a rickshaw puller, from Jiangbei, residing on Guangzhao Road, Zhabei; Du Shide, age 21, from Suzhou, residing at 108 Dongfuhai Lane, Parker Road; Teng Gengsheng, age 19, from Pudong, residing at 109 Dongfuhai Lane; Xu Guangming, age 52, residing at 1112 Yangjia Lane, Gordon Road; Feng Arong, age 54, residing at 1820 Hele Lane, Xin Zha Road. The aforementioned individuals sustained varying degrees of injuries to their heads, faces, hands, and feet. However, Tian Baoshan, Jiang A Jin, and Qi Guangming suffered the most severe injuries and are currently receiving treatment at Baolong Hospital. The incident reportedly occurred when Japanese soldiers abruptly closed the iron gate on the Wuzhen Road Bridge yesterday evening, causing many people on the north bank to climb over the barbed wire fence to the south. Upon seeing this, the Japanese soldiers attempted to stop them, chasing after them. In desperation, people threw stones. The Japanese soldiers then used their bayonets to stab the aforementioned individuals. While being chased by the Japanese soldiers, the injured Tian Baoshan fled into the Shanghai Car Company on Xin Zha Road, hiding between two cars, but was still stabbed by the Japanese soldiers. When the incident occurred, shops on both sides of Xin Zha Road hastily closed their doors, and everyone was extremely alarmed.</p>

<p>▲ And Submits a Request to the Central Government for Commendation and Awards</p>
<p>During this Shanghai Incident, all areas outside the Shanghai war zone were maintained by Director Wen Yingxing of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who led his subordinates and was responsible for maintaining order, achieving considerable success. Yesterday, Garrison Commander Dai Ji specifically issued an order to Director Wen, offering high praise and comfort. The order stated: "To inform you, Shanghai is a corner connecting China and foreign countries, and its safety is crucial, affecting the entire nation. The Director took office not long ago, and after the deployment was roughly determined, the Shanghai Incident occurred. From dawn to dusk, he urged the police officers and was diligent in his duties. This enabled the front-line to win decisive battles. Even amidst the thunderous sounds of artillery fire, all areas outside the war zone remained stable, and the supply was not lacking, achieving the effect of cooperation between the military and the people, and maintaining the precarious situation together with this Commander. On March 1st, our army strategically retreated, and there was not a single soldier or a single pawn in the suburbs of Songhu. This Commander then led the staff and followed the army's movements, continuing to resist. The security of the southern part of Shanghai and the western part of Shanghai was handed over to the Director, who was responsible for leading the police and security teams to maintain order and act accordingly. The Director was able to cope calmly despite difficulties, repeatedly solving major reactionary cases, eliminating hidden dangers, preventing the covetousness of foreign powers, and protecting the economic lifeline of the country. The southern and western parts of Shanghai were ultimately preserved. Your hard work and dedicated planning are worthy of praise. In addition to submitting a special report to the Central Government for inspection and commendation to encourage meritorious service, this order is specifically issued to the Director for your information. You should still supervise your subordinates to remain unremitting from beginning to end, to achieve complete success and ensure peace in Nanjing. This is of utmost importance. This order."</p>

<p>Guowen News Agency reports that our agency's reporter met with a responsible person from the Public Security Bureau yesterday regarding the takeover of Zhabei. According to the conversation, since the Shanghai Incident, more than 1,700 public security police officers from the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh District Offices and various branches in Zhabei have scattered. Now that the situation has stabilized, they have been returning one after another. However, the total number is no more than 700, all of whom have been incorporated into the police brigade. The brigade is divided into more than ten companies, which is more than enough to maintain security in the southern part of the city, but not enough to take care of Zhabei. Therefore, as the ceasefire agreement is about to be signed and the Japanese soldiers are withdrawing from the area, the superiors have transferred 500 security guards from Beiping to Shanghai to be assigned to various parts of Zhabei. As for some people advocating for reform after the destruction, it is not allowed by the time. Therefore, all the organization rules and regulations remain the same. Even in terms of financial support, there is no ambiguity. Therefore, after the bureau affairs meeting decided on the takeover measures last Saturday, Wang Zhijing, head of the Second Section, has been designated to take charge, assisted by secretaries Feng Yuanxiang and Ju Jing, as well as Wu Zhiquan, head of the First Section, Gong Xigui, the inspector general, Huang Ming, the brigade commander, Lu Ying, the head of the detective team, and Liang Jiagan, the head of the water patrol team, to handle the takeover matters.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the National Federation of Commercial Associations telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Supervisory Yuan, and Ministry of Transportation of the National Government in Luoyang, stating: "An investigation into the increase in postal rates reveals that various groups believe that at this time of national crisis and economic devastation, the increase in postal rates is an unbearable burden for the people. They have risen up in opposition. The Ministry of Transportation, disregarding public opinion, resolutely implemented the increase on May 1st of this year. The amount of the increase ranges from one to several times, with a minimum increase of 50%. The affiliated associations believe that there are three reasons why postal rates cannot be increased at this time: (1) During this time of national crisis, various agencies are reducing staff and salaries to cut expenses, while the postal service has recently increased numerous redundant agencies, resulting in expenses exceeding income. They are not cutting spending but thinking of increasing revenue. This is the first reason why rates should not be increased. (2) Since last year's national flood, people have been displaced and have not yet recovered. This was followed by the September 18th and January 28th incidents, which caused industry and commerce to stagnate and markets to become depressed. It is a time when the people of the whole country are enduring hardship and working together to overcome difficulties and expenses are insufficient. Only by cutting spending and reducing salaries can difficulties be overcome. This is the second reason why rates cannot be increased. (3) The Legislative Yuan has already promulgated the 21st-year general budget of the postal service at the 138th session. The price increase was not included, and it was generally believed to be illegal. Since the 21st-year budget has been established, there is a detailed budget for income and expenditure, and there must be a solution within the 21st year. This is the third reason why rates should not be increased. Combining the above three points, postal rates cannot be increased at this time, and the increase is so large. We hereby telegraph to inform your government ministries and courts, requesting that you quickly order the Ministry of Transportation to revoke its order and continue to operate according to the old regulations, in order to alleviate the people's livelihood. This is our earnest prayer."</p>
<p>▲ Statement from the National Postal Workers' Union</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain newspaper carried a conversation with a standing committee member of the National Postal Workers' Union, stating that postal workers would automatically take effective measures and still affix stamps at the old price for all mailed items, and would not consider them as underpaid, etc. Now, according to a statement from the National Postal Workers' Union, regarding the matter of the increase in postal rates, it is believed that the increased rate is too high and the burden on the people is too heavy. In order to maintain the postal economy and consolidate the postal foundation, specific methods have been proposed (already published in yesterday's newspaper) to the authorities in charge, the main purpose of which is to ask the Ministry of Transportation to first accept the opinions of the postal workers and plan a plan to consolidate the postal base, and then decide on a method to remedy the postal economy based on this plan, so that both the people's burden and the economic foundation can be taken into account. If the Ministry of Transportation does not accept the proposed plan, then the union will take effective measures to reduce the people's burden and maintain the postal economy, ordering postal workers' unions in various places to take consistent action. It is also reported that the two postal associations have sent representatives to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
<p>▲ Order from the Zhabei Forest Bureau to the Shanghai Postal Administration Director</p>
<p>The Zhabei Forest Bureau, issued Order No. 1503 to the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, saying: "For your information, the increased and revised postal rates were previously notified in Order No. 1485. Now, Postal Administration Circular No. 68 states: The increased and revised postal rates were previously ordered in Circular No. 666 and the telegram of April 13th. Now, an order from the Ministry of Transportation states that due to special circumstances, the increased postal rates for all mail sent from the three northeastern provinces should be temporarily suspended. Therefore, mail coming from the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang postal areas that have already paid the old postal rates should not be considered underpaid, and there is no need to collect the difference between the old and new rates from the recipients. However, mail sent to the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang postal areas should be collected according to the newly established postal rates. Except for the Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang postal areas, all mail from other postal areas that were posted with the old postal rates between May 1st and May 31st will not be considered underpaid, but the difference between the old and new rates must be collected from the recipients before delivery. After June 1st, if there are any mail that have not paid the new postal rates in full, they should be handled as underpaid and the shortfall should be recovered twice over. " I have received this, and it should be followed in its entirety. Postmaster Zha Peilin.</p>

<p>▲ The Court Should be Ordered to Hold a Public Trial</p>
<p>▲ Permission Should be Given to Hire Lawyers for Defense</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei telegraphed Wang Jingwei, saying, "Chief Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, in your esteemed judgment, the Noulens case has long been a focus of international attention. European and American scholars have specially established an international rescue committee dedicated to the rescue. Regardless of Noulens's claims, the government should order the court to hold a public trial and allow him to hire lawyers for defense. China is seeking justice and sympathy from the world and should treat people with justice and sympathy. My humble opinion is as such. Respectfully awaiting your wise decision. Cai Yuanpei."</p>
<h3 id="e17">Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter Urging the Public Works Department to Quickly Determine Measures to Exempt Municipal Taxes <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday to urge the exemption of municipal taxes in the disaster-stricken areas of the concession. The letter stated: "We are writing to inquire about the case of exempting municipal taxes in the disaster-stricken areas of the concession. Our association previously sent a letter to your department in accordance with the resolution of the Representatives' Conference, requesting your department to investigate and handle the matter. We have not yet received a reply, and we assume that it is still under discussion and progress. We now have a letter from the temporary office of the Hongkou District sub-associations of the Citizens' Federation, dated April 30th, stating that citizens on Broadway Road and others reported that the doors of No. 141 on that road were tightly closed, but the tax collectors of your department still went to find them to collect taxes. We request a serious protest and early achievement of the exemption purpose. We are specially forwarding this letter to you, urging you to quickly verify and determine the exemption measures and reply to us. Before these measures have been determined, the collection of taxes should be temporarily suspended to avoid causing disputes. This is what we earnestly request."</p>

<p>▲ Twenty-Five Printing Workers Kidnapped</p>
<p>▲ Taxpayers' Association Asks the Public Works Department to Investigate Quickly</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We are writing to inform you that Zou Ruhe and Shen Xitao, representatives of the Shanghai Lead Printing Industry Workers' Union, came to the association to report that at 9:00 PM on May 2nd, Japanese troops kidnapped 25 workers, including Shang Xilin, from the Nanyang Printing Co., Ltd. at No. 322-323, Tiantong Road (four others were not kidnapped, but one was seriously injured by beatings). The kidnapping method was to force each person to drink medicine to make them unconscious, then tie their hands behind their backs, throw them one by one from the balcony on the third floor to the ground, spray cold water on their faces to wake them up, put them on trucks, and drive them north on North Sichuan Road, whereabouts unknown. They asked us to negotiate with the Public Works Department to investigate and rescue them. This unstable situation has completely lost Shanghai's normality. Now, as your department is trying to restore normality, this unfortunate incident of kidnapping workers has occurred, making your department's efforts to restore normality even less certain, which is very distressing. We believe that if this unstable force is not vigorously eliminated, Shanghai's commerce and prosperity will not be completely destroyed, and your department's authority will certainly be completely unable to exercise its functions one day. According to the reported situation, we are enclosing copies of the relevant documents and sending them to your department, requesting that in addition to quickly investigating and rescuing the kidnapped workers, you should also adopt the most effective measures to restore normality as soon as possible and protect the safety of residents' lives and property."</p>

<p>▲ Joint Effort with Shanghai's Four Major National Products Organizations</p>
<p>▲ Welcoming National Products Manufacturers to Participate Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Exhibition Hall in this city has been established for over eleven years. Upholding the spirit of promoting national products, its carefully planned management has achieved remarkable results. Last year, it added a national products shopping mall, bringing together national manufacturers to showcase their exquisite national products to compete with imported goods. With a steady approach, it has inspired compatriots to enjoy using national products. Its far-sighted plans are admirable. Unfortunately, since the January 28th incident, the eastern neighbor has provoked trouble for no reason, and the national products business has been almost completely destroyed. With keen insight into the current situation, it is essential to intensify the promotion of national products. Recently, the association received a letter from the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, requesting assistance in designing expanded publicity efforts to actively awaken the public, promote national products, and jointly save the country and maintain national products. With the same goals, the association should cooperate and plans to join with Shanghai's four major national products organizations to jointly launch a large-scale national products exhibition, to lead compatriots to realize the goal of saving the country through national products, in order to recover rights and prevent leakage. Moreover, in order to encourage national products manufacturers to participate enthusiastically, the association will designate the entire second floor of the Commodity Exhibition Hall as a temporary shopping mall. All manufacturers who join in sales will be exempt from location rent. The association has already replied to the Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products, seeking the consent of the other three national products organizations. It is reported that the two parties will convene a meeting of relevant manufacturers' representatives specifically for this matter on the next two days. After the five organizations jointly discuss practical measures, the exhibition can be held in mid-May.</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e23">Lytton's Preliminary Report Published in Geneva <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Completely Based on Japanese Intelligence</p>
<p>Reserving Position on the Puppet State</p>
<p>No Judgment Made on Who is to Blame</p>
<p>(Geneva) The preliminary report of the League of Nations' Manchurian Investigation Team, headed by Lord Lytton, was published here today. When mentioning the puppet government in the report, quotation marks were added before and after the phrase "Government of Manchukuo" to indicate that this is the government that they call themselves and to fully reserve judgment on whether it has the status of a true government. In addition, it was mentioned that several Japanese officers had signed contracts with the "Government of Manchukuo" to train its troops for one year. It is now expected that the Lytton Report will be sent to the Council soon, and after the Council receives it, it may be sent to Simon, the chairman of the League of Nations General Assembly. Today, League of Nations officials claimed that they did not consider the report sufficiently important to convene a special meeting of the Nineteen-Nation Committee. This preliminary report is largely formal in nature and is only the basis for the Investigation Team's true work. A detailed report of their work will be sent later. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The preliminary report of the Manchurian Investigation Team released by the League of Nations Secretariat today mostly describes the military situation in the Northeast. It solemnly states that the Investigation Team cannot yet draw any firm conclusions, so it feels that it is only appropriate at this time to describe the military situation. As for the military situation, the report made a brief judgment, calling it "completely chaotic." The report estimates that the troops fighting in Manchuria at this time include approximately 100,000 Chinese volunteers and militia. These irregular troops are opposed by 220,000 Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria and 89,000 "Manchukuo" troops trained and supplied with military equipment by the Japanese. As a result of these armies' year-round warfare, no area in the three northeastern provinces is safe. However, the question of who is to blame for creating this tragic situation cannot be determined at this time. In this environment, the Investigation Team must reserve its conclusions and recommendations for a later report. It is now reported that this preliminary report will be presented at the League of Nations Council meeting on the 5th and 9th. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Secretariat has received the preliminary report of the Lytton Investigation Team, sent from Shenyang on April 30, and will be released on Wednesday morning. This report, based on information provided by the Japanese authorities, details the current military situation in the three northeastern provinces. It is said that in the second half of April, a total of 6,600 Japanese troops were stationed within the South Manchuria Railway Zone, and 15,000 were stationed outside the zone. Half of the Manchukuo army were Chinese regular troops stationed in the three northeastern provinces before September 18, and were later reorganized with the assistance of the Japanese, totaling 85,000 men. Japanese officers were hired as military advisors, and their numbers gradually increased, all with one-year contracts. A Japanese officer was appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of National Defense of the Changchun Manchukuo Government. At the end of March, the Manchukuo army was mostly fighting in Shenyang, Changchun, Taonan, Qiqihar, Dunhua, and along the Middle East Railway line to resist the anti-Manchukuo army. Wars between the two armies and attacks by bandits were often heard, and the general public was uneasy. The Japanese believe that during this period, it is impossible to withdraw Japanese troops without endangering the lives and property of Japanese residents outside the railway zone. The timing of the withdrawal depends on the progress of the reorganization of the Manchukuo army. The report concludes that the Chinese government no longer has any authority in any part of the three northeastern provinces. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The preliminary report of the League of Nations Manchurian Investigation Team released here stated that the section claiming that there were 220,000 Japanese troops in Manchuria has been withdrawn this morning. It is claimed that the Manchukuo army was mistakenly included in the statistics. The revised text now states that the total number of Japanese troops and Manchukuo government troops that can be dispatched is 226,000, including 22,400 Japanese regular troops, 119,000 Japanese military police, and 85,000 Manchukuo troops. The opposing forces include 30,000 Chinese regular troops and 20,000 volunteer militia in Jilin Province. It is also said that before September 18 last year, there were a total of 140,000 Chinese troops in Manchuria, and 60,000 have now switched to Manchukuo, while the rest have either withdrawn to China or joined the volunteer army. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The preliminary report of the Lytton Investigation Team states that the Chinese government no longer has any authority over any part of Manchuria. The Manchukuo army is now under Japanese protection, has been reorganized, and is fighting against the army that does not recognize the new government. The Japanese insist that it is impossible to withdraw Japanese troops at this time without endangering Japanese residents outside the South Manchuria Railway Zone. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Xie Enzeng, a representative of the Investigation Team, arrived in Pingjin this afternoon. Xie said that the Chinese representatives going to Changchun included only Gu and Yang Chengji, as well as Qi Zhaozuo, Liu Junjie, Chen Liting, and consultant He Saijingna and others, a total of seven people. The remaining 30 returned south in two batches on the 2nd. The Japanese closely monitored the Investigation Team in Shenyang, with detectives following every step of the way. When traveling to Shenyang from Dalian, the Chinese representatives were in the last compartment, separated by Japanese representatives to prevent our side from contacting the Investigation Team. After arriving in Shenyang, the Japanese prepared rooms in the Yamato Hotel, allocating only four rooms for the 20 or more Chinese representatives. They then found their own accommodation at the Oriental Hotel, and all expenses were paid by themselves. Each of our representatives was monitored by four Japanese detectives. Relatives and friends who went to the hotel to visit were arrested by the Japanese military police, severely interrogated, and forced to sign and affix fingerprints, regardless of whether they had reported to the Investigation Team. Ge Gongzhen was arrested by the Japanese after going to the commercial port area after dinner and was released after 7:00 PM. The Investigation Team met with Honjo five times and wanted to inspect the arsenal, Beida Camp, and the site of the incident on South Manchuria Road but was rejected by Honjo. He also refused to meet with Chinese officials. Lytton very much wanted to see Zang but was unable to do so. One day, Lytton planned to go to Beiling to play ball, but the Japanese hired a large number of hooligans, giving each of them five Japanese cents to hold petition banners and wait in advance. Later, Lytton did not go due to business. (Special Dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Wang Jingwei Issues a Responsible Statement Regarding the Shanghai Case <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Thoughts on Guo Taiqi Being Beaten</p>
<p>Government Maintains Open Attitude Towards Ceasefire Conference</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Following Guo Taiqi's beating, Wang Jingwei issued a responsible statement, saying, "During this Shanghai ceasefire conference, representatives Guo Taiqi, Dai Ji, and Huang Qiang were upright and honorable, and can truly be said to have fulfilled their mission. Moreover, the conference proceedings were reported to the government at all times, and methods were decided upon before being solemnly implemented. And the government's decisions on methods were always made after detailed discussion and unanimous agreement by the State Council, and were never unilaterally advocated by any one person. Suddenly, this association received the news that Representative Guo had been attacked and injured by thugs, which truly cannot but cause infinite apology and sympathy. The process by which Representative Guo handled the ceasefire conference not only fulfilled his duties to the government, but also earned the trust of genuine mass organizations in Shanghai, as evidenced by telegrams. Therefore, it can be determined that this attack by thugs was carried out by a few people harboring malicious intentions, disregarding the law, and acting recklessly. This is something that cannot be ignored for the sake of national discipline and social stability. At the same time that we received the news of Representative Guo being attacked and injured by thugs, we also received a winter telegram from the so-called United Association of Shanghai Organizations. The criticism in it is still vague regarding the progress of the ceasefire conference. What is even more bizarre is that it states, 'As the agreement was about to be reached, the Japanese side put forward the so-called demand that no troops be stationed in the southern city of Pudong. Our representative, at the request of the British ambassador, telegraphed Beijing for instructions, which can be said to be the height of national humiliation.' However, they do not know that this demand from the Japanese side had already been withdrawn through the efforts of Representatives Guo, Dai, and Huang, as well as the mediation of friendly countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. And the association still picks this up as material for attack. Even if we assume that it is not malicious, it can be said to be very far from the truth. The government has always maintained an open attitude towards the progress of the ceasefire conference, and will announce it in detail in the future to clarify the truth. However, we cannot but be appropriately vigilant towards those who maliciously criticize. As for those who hide in the concessions and make a career of undermining the law and disrupting order, we cannot tolerate them in the slightest. Only by punishing them severely can we quell this arrogance." (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>And Arrest Key Personnel</p>
<p>Aiming to Seize the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to a report from Boliyi, the situation in Harbin remains serious. The arrest of Soviet citizens and employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway continues daily. Recently, the Japanese have even planned to take a further step, inspecting all Soviet institutions in Manchuria. Since the bombing of the Songhua River bridge and the derailment incident on the Chinese Eastern Railway, the provocative plans of the White Russians have been carried out with increasing force, and all are directed by the Japanese. Their intention is clearly to provoke disputes between the Soviet Union and the Manchurian government and the Japanese. However, it is heard that the large number of arrested Soviet citizens, despite being subjected to severe torture, have not provided any confession that could satisfy the desire of the provocateurs to create evidence of Soviet involvement in the bombing of the bridge. And this kind of rumor and slander is precisely to show the Japanese's intentions, which are to divert public attention from the Manchurian volunteer army and self-defense forces, in order to facilitate their attack. The Japanese are currently planning to arrest key personnel of all Soviet institutions in Manchuria and seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to reliable sources, this plan will be implemented within the next few days. The Japanese have now fabricated various documents to be publicized abroad after the inspection, as evidence obtained. (3rd TASS Dispatch)</p>

Yi then ordered the military and police to withdraw and telegraphed the province for instructions on how to proceed. The five students under supervision were all treated well. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Unrelated to the Far Eastern Situation</p>
<p>General Bullard Issues Solemn Statement</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 2nd. General Bullard, Commander of the US Navy, solemnly stated today that the Navy Department's dispatch of the Atlantic Patrol Fleet to the Pacific was solely for the purpose of having the entire navy participate in maneuvers and had absolutely no connection with the Far Eastern situation. He also said that the maneuvers could be called a success, but he believed that this action had proven to be ineffective because the various plans mainly focused on providing training for the officers and men of the various ships and did not include any designs for testing defensive positions or possible enemy attacks.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Lakehurst, 2nd. The United States' largest airship, the Akron, has been repaired and will conduct a test flight tonight. As for departing for the Pacific coast to participate in the maneuvers, it is expected that it will only be able to depart around this Saturday. The rumors circulating in various places on the Pacific coast that it will depart today are not true.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Europe Spreads Rumor of Polish Attempt to Attack Danzig <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Related Parties Issue Statements to Deny the Rumor</p>
<p>Rumors Have Background</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 2nd. German political circles are widely spreading the rumor today that on May 1st, the Polish authorities planned to seize the Free City of Danzig, but this was prevented by the timely intervention of France and the League of Nations-appointed High Commissioner of the Free City of Danzig, Count Gravina, and therefore did not materialize. It is further reported that Poland wanted to acquire Danzig because it feared that war would break out this summer, and if it acquired Danzig, it could use its port to transport munitions. It has been found that the London newspapers today carried this news, which was the source of the German rumors. Within a few hours, this rumor had spread throughout Europe. By this afternoon, the parties concerned were urgently denying the accuracy of the London news. The Paris External Affairs Office first issued a statement of defense, stating that the French authorities were unaware of Poland's attempt to seize Danzig and therefore could not have intervened. Warsaw said that the London newspapers were being fooled, and Count Gravina issued a declaration from Danzig stating that he knew nothing about the various rumors in the London newspapers. By tonight's newspaper release, most people believed the explanations from all sides and felt that Poland was unlikely to take such a great risk at this time, which would be detrimental to itself. However, some newspapers felt that the London newspapers' reports were not entirely fictional and that rumors must have a background. Furthermore, the spread of this news has shocked all of Europe, which shows that the Polish government's attitude is indeed suspicious.</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, London, 3rd. Of the three London newspapers that published the news yesterday of Poland's attempt to seize the Free City of Danzig (Daily Express, Daily Mail, and Daily Chronicle), only the Labor Party's organ newspaper compiled the matter and strongly stated that the news was extremely reliable, but because the Polish Chief of Staff disclosed it before it matured, it caused French intervention. This morning, it was also heard that the Polish Ambassador went to the British Foreign Office yesterday to strenuously deny this claim, saying that Polish-German relations have greatly improved since the German Chancellor and the Polish Foreign Minister met in Geneva, and that this rumor was spread by those who wanted to obstruct Polish-German friendship.</p>

<p>▲ Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd. The government's pending Greater Tokyo construction plan to merge 82 villages in the suburbs will be established. Its area is 17,222,930坪 (tsubo) (approximately 56.9 square kilometers, 6 square feet per tsubo), with 1,116,600 households and a population of 4,942,200, second only to New York and can be called the second largest city in the world.</p>

<p>No Illiteracy in the Country</p>
<p>Deeply Satisfied with the Results</p>
<p>▲ TASS, Leningrad, 3rd. The British education community recently organized a delegation to inspect education in the Soviet Union. The delegation consisted of 21 well-known educators, including two Americans, namely Professor Hull of the Institute of Social Economics at the University of Michigan and Professor Babcock. They first went to Leningrad and then to Moscow. In both places, they conducted a detailed inspection of all levels of schools in the Soviet Union. Lewis, an adult education expert from Cambridge University, expressed his impressions of the inspection to newspaper reporters, saying that the deepest feeling he and others had from this trip was the spirit of optimism that exists in the Soviet Union. Before the visit, many of them had a purely neutral attitude, and a few were critics of Soviet education. However, as a result of the inspection, they were all very satisfied because they felt that the Soviet Union was like a big school in which everyone was studying.</p>
<h3 id="e85">British Prime Minister's Left Eye Suffers from Glaucoma <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Surgery Performed in Geneva</p>
<p>Political Circles Discuss the Matter Extensively</p>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 2nd. British Prime Minister MacDonald's right eye is also suffering from "glaucoma," just like his left eye before. Tonight, political circles are widely spreading the rumor that in order to prevent the progression of the disease, the Prime Minister's right eye may be operated on. Some people even say that surgery will be required tomorrow. This morning, after the Prime Minister was examined by an ophthalmologist, no announcement was made about his condition. It is only known that the examination lasted for two hours, and another specialist may need to be consulted. The doctor believes that the Prime Minister's eye disease is due to the heavy workload, so he intends to order him to take a break. This can be seen in conjunction with the Prime Minister's long talk with Baldwin after the diagnosis. Political and journalistic circles do not know whether the Prime Minister will soon have to abandon politics due to the pressure of the disease. This kind of argument is spreading widely, and even plans are being made for his successor. Most people suggest the current Minister of Commerce, Runciman, as MacDonald's successor. As for Baldwin, because of his qualifications as the leader of the majority party, he is the best choice for Prime Minister, but Baldwin does not seem to be interested in this at present. Baldwin's political enemies believe that the Conservative Party leader will only accept political power after the British debt problem with the United States is resolved.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Honolulu, 3rd. The US Pacific Foreign Trade Conference is scheduled to open here tomorrow and will last for three days. Participants include representatives from the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and various Asian countries. Because the commercial markets of countries bordering the Pacific Ocean are becoming increasingly important, a round table conference will be held after the opening to discuss plans for expanding commerce in these countries.

It is non-political in nature and is organized by bankers, manufacturers, merchants, and people in the railway and shipping industries.</p>

<p>Chinese Discover Dry Plate Characteristics</p>
<p>Huazhou Soybean Sprouts Can Treat Jaundice</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 2nd. At a meeting of the French National Academy of Sciences, Professor Fabry, professor of physics and director of the Optical Institute at the University of Paris, introduced the research achievements of two Chinese professors from Peiping, Nie Dashi and Qian Linzhao (transliteration). What Professors Nie and Qian discovered is a unique characteristic of a type of photographic dry plate. When photographing, if a large amount of air pressure is applied to the dry plate, the plate's photosensitivity is greatly reduced. When this pressure reaches 1,250 kilograms per square centimeter, the exposure time must be doubled. In addition, Mr. Nicoll reported that Sierra and Le Grey had previously studied jaundice in West Africa and have now discovered a type of soybean sprout that can treat this disease.</p>

<p>◎ Fuzhou Telegram Addressed to All Newspapers: Regarding the Shanghai telegram reporting that the Communist bandit Zhu De occupied Zhangzhou and that the proclamation issued listed Zhongming, etc., after reading it, we were deeply shocked. It has been found that after the bandits were defeated in Ganzhou, a part of them fled to Longyan and Zhangzhou. Our troops stationed in the Fuyi area of this route are actively searching for and suppressing the remaining bandits to eliminate the roots. The Shanghai telegram's claims are obviously bandits impersonating Zhongming and making false claims to create a false impression and mislead the audience. We specially telegraph this to the whole country so that the truth is known. Lian Zhongshu, division commander of Zhanggong, is responsible for suppressing the Communists. We will fight to the death. This is our unwavering intention, and we hope that the people of the country will understand. Sun Lianzhong, Commander-in-Chief of the Twenty-Sixth Route Army, winter.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e90">◎ Record of the Anti-Japanese Activities of the Volunteer Army in Liaoning · Special Correspondence from Shenyang · <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been many reports from various sources regarding the situation of the anti-Japanese war in Jilin and Heilongjiang, while news from Liaoning has been relatively quiet. In fact, anti-Japanese activities in Liaoning have not disappeared. However, there have been many changes in the Volunteer Army that has been formed in various places, and the resistance of the ordinary people has gradually increased. The following is a brief description of the recent situation:</p>
<p>(1) In the western Liaoning area, the Jin Dexuan and Shi Anquan units attacked Suizhong in late March, disarming part of Zhang Ziqing's pro-Japanese faction and seizing more than 30 rifles. Later, due to a lack of ammunition and heavy shelling by the enemy, they could not hold out. Li Kunshan of the Jin unit was killed in battle, and Shi Anquan was wounded. The Jin and Shi units were disintegrated as a result. Zheng Guilin, Sun Xichen and other units participated in this battle. The Zheng unit advanced and retreated early and suffered no losses. The Sun unit suffered heavy losses. Previously, the Beining Railway could not be used for half a month, which was also their doing. The Zheng Guilin unit has more than 1,000 people and is still stationed between Suizhong and Xingcheng, intensifying reorganization in order to resist again. North of Goubangzi, the Geng Jizhou unit has about 600 people. Originally, its momentum was quite strong, but it surrendered to Zhang Hai peng, causing the Jin Ziming unit near Dahushan to collapse with it. However, the Liu Fengshan unit still has 600 to 700 people, is powerful, and is actively training. Near Jinxi, there is a Yu 囗囗 unit. People from all sides have praised its organization as rare and its discipline as strict, and its relationship with the local people is very good. The basic team has 5,000 people and is still in the training and organization period. As soon as it matures, it will come out to resist Japan.</p>
<p>(2) In the southern Liaoning area, most of Yu Mingjia's troops were resolved by the Japanese. There are still about 2,000 people in the Li Chunhua unit, which is still stationed in a certain place west of Haicheng and can survive on its own. Zhao Jishi and others in Liaoyang fought against the Japanese and killed dozens of enemies. They then retreated to Qianshan due to the Japanese army's fierce attack. In early March, Na Xiangyang, Jin Shanjian, etc. near Shenyang attacked Beiguan in Panyang and seized more than 200 police firearms. They then retreated to their defense area. Recently, on April 17, they infiltrated Shenyang again, burned down the grain and fodder factory, and burned all the military grain stored there. They also cut off the poles and wires near Shenyang for several miles, and news was cut off for a time. After the incident, a letter was sent to the League of Nations investigation team to express public opinion and oppose the puppet state. At that time, the League of Nations investigation team had sent several people to Shenyang in advance. It can be seen from this that the people of Northeast China are not willing to succumb to the tyranny of Japan.</p>
<p>(3) In the eastern Liaoning area, the Deng 囗囗 unit is currently stationed in a certain place on the Anfeng Line and has a strong force. They are engaged in training and are taking the opportunity to act. In addition, the Liu 囗囗 unit of a certain county, with about 2,000 people, has taken advantage of its strategic location, with steep mountains and ridges, which can be attacked or defended. The area along Changbai Mountain is a natural dangerous place. In early March, the army attacked the Niuxintai Station. The soldiers fought bravely, and the results of the battle were very good. They captured a stationmaster, captured seven Japanese alive, and three Japanese police officers were executed on the spot. They also seized six large guns, three small guns, and six light machine guns. Liu is a member of the education community, and his team does not disturb the people in any way. The people sympathize with him and provide military supplies at any time. The future achievements of this army are immeasurable.</p>
<p>(4) The northern Liaoning area borders Rehe and has always been a district with many bandits. After the Northeast Incident, there are also many heroes of the green forest who are engaged in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. According to the latest report, Xiao Bailong, Mantianhong, etc., led a crowd of about 8,000 to 9,000 people, circling northwest of Tongliao, and on April 23, they destroyed a part of Dengjiatun in Tongliao, creating a huge momentum. If they can capture Tongliao and hold the Sitao route, Shenyang and Changchun will be in danger.</p>
<p>In general, the activities of the Volunteer Army in various parts of Liaoning reached their peak in early January this year when Jinzhou was evacuated. Then, due to the exhaustion of ammunition and the lack of support, the Volunteer Army in various places disintegrated. The battle of Suizhong by Shi Anquan, Jin Dexuan, etc., caused the Japanese some losses, but the Shi and Jin units were all defeated and did not form an army. Of the more than 20 commanders commissioned by the Northeast People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, only about one or two can lead their troops. However, the members of each route are still alive and have not been eliminated. Most of them are looking for their own ways, either hiding in the people's regiments and mountains and forests, and planning to unite again, or mixing under the Japanese flag and waiting for the opportunity to move. The Volunteer Army, which is still under the leadership of someone, is forming ties with the people on the one hand, and sending secret signals to the teams reorganized by the Japanese on the other hand, making it almost impossible for the leaders of the surrendered army to prevent them. The Japanese army recently sent Yu Zhishan's troops to search for bandits everywhere (referring to the Volunteer Army). The villages they passed through were peaceful, which was a peaceful scene that the Japanese could never have dreamed of. The so-called bandits (Volunteer Army) do not want to be enemies with the bandits. Every time they arrive, they either obtain a few broken guns to fulfill their responsibility, or obtain some bribes to enrich themselves. The ones ordered to suppress bandits are all Chinese, and they all had considerable relationships in the past. Who would be willing to suppress bandits for the Japanese? The Japanese have never known this, but they can't do anything about it. On the other hand, since the Japanese implemented group immigration and caused suffering to the people everywhere, the people's hatred deepened and their desire to kill the enemy became stronger. Although the anti-Japanese situation in various places seems to have declined recently, it is actually brewing and becoming more profound. Once it breaks out, its momentum will be unstoppable.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Harbin Consulates of Various Countries Submit Fair Reports <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>▲ Contribution to the League of Nations Investigation Team</p>
<p>▲ The Japanese Are Concerned About a Certain Country</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun said that the League of Nations Investigation Team is about to arrive in Harbin. The consulates of various countries stationed in Harbin have drafted a report on the situation in Jilin and Heilongjiang and will submit it to the League of Nations Investigation Team. The Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry will also submit a report on the points that hinder trade to the team. It has been vaguely heard that a certain country will submit reference materials that are extremely unfavorable to Manchuria from an independent standpoint.</p>
<h3 id="e92">◎ British Opinions on Japan <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Majority Advocate Alliance with the US Against Japan</p>
<p>▲ Some Even Consider Japan a Major Enemy of Britain</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reporter Su Fengsheng commented on Britain's attitude toward Japan, saying that Britain's recent policy toward Japan can be divided into three types: (1) A very small number of people in the country regret that the Anglo-Japanese Alliance has been severed, such as General Max Hamilton, the editor of the National Review, who advocates being pro-Japan. (2) The majority of people's mentality advocates alliance with the United States, believing that this is the only national policy. Since the World War, the most appropriate foreign policy is to follow the United States and oppose Japan in everything. Therefore, the argument for being pro-American and distancing oneself from Japan has spread throughout the country. (3) Japan is regarded as a major enemy of Britain, exposing Japan's conspiracy to instigate the natives of India, Singapore, and other countries to disrupt British-controlled colonies, and saying that if an accident occurs between Japan and the United States, Japan will occupy British Columbia and use it as its base. Moreover, Japan originally has great ambitions and intends to annex more than 400 states in China in the future, which will completely destroy Britain's commercial interests in China. Furthermore, it will covet Australia. In order to eliminate obstacles, Britain urgently needs to cooperate with the United States to contain this scourge of the world. The most vocal advocate of this faction is Mr. Wichham Steed, former editor of The Times, who published "The Policy of Pacific Nations" in the April issue of Nineteenth Century and After. His rejection of Japan is quite fierce, just like the opinion held by the late Lord Northcliffe in his later years to travel around the world. The two are similar in every way. From this point of view, our people (Japanese) should recognize that Britain's policy toward Japan is what our people are most worried about.</p>
<h3 id="e93">◎ US-Russian Resumption of Diplomatic Relations <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>▲ The United States Says It Cannot Be Delayed</p>
<p>▲ Sufficient to Eliminate Far Eastern Dangers</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun's New York telegram said that since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the attitudes of Russia and the United States have attracted the attention of the world. The Soviet Union requested recognition from the United States, and the US Congress, regardless of the Senate and the House of Representatives or the Republican and Democratic parties, is strongly advocating the theory of recognizing Russia in order to eliminate the world's recession. On the 23rd of last month, John Haram, a well-known anti-Japanese Senator from California, issued a statement strongly advocating that the resumption of relations with the Soviet Union should not be delayed. The statement put forward two major points: (1) From the standpoint of promoting international trade and increasing exports, diplomatic relations should be resumed with the Soviet Union as soon as possible. (2) From the perspective of its policy towards Japan, Japan has now occupied vast lands in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, and the troops of Japan and Russia are concentrated on the Chinese border. The situation between the two sides is becoming increasingly serious, and war is imminent. After Japan conquers China, it will try to defeat Russia and become the king of the world. In order to curb Japan's ambitions, the United States should resume normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union at this time, so that it can eliminate the dangers in the Far East, and thereby eliminate general dangers in the world. Therefore, recognizing Russia is the most effective method.</p>
<h3 id="e94">◎ Coastal Siberian State's Severe Air and Land Defense <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>▲ In a State of War</p>
<p>▲ But Japan Tries Its Best to Avoid It</p>
<p>The Nagoya Shimbun's Harbin telegram said that recently Vladivostok has been placed under martial law. Telegrams are stopped every day after 8:00 PM, and the coastal lighthouses do not shine at night. The Red Army continues to arrive. Vladivostok has suddenly become a fortress area. On Russky Island, heavy artillery and anti-aircraft artillery have been installed. In addition, numerous large and small airfields have been set up in various parts of the coastal state, centered on Posiet Bay near the Russian-Korean border. The Russian Volunteer Fleet has stopped ocean voyages and is busy repairing ships. All merchant ships are fully armed, and foreign ships cannot enter the port. Workers in various factories are working day and night, and women's rescue teams have been organized. The wartime atmosphere is extremely strong, and people's hearts are extremely uneasy. In addition, the Osaka Asahi Shimbun reported that Commander Honjo talked to American reporters and tried his best to avoid starting a war with Russia. When the American reporters asked about the bombing of the Chinese Eastern Railway, it was rumored that the Soviet Russian government was behind it. Honjo replied that Japan and Russia were trying to maintain peace, and that the bombing of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the overturning of military trains were not backed by the Soviet Union, but were the work of Chinese soldiers and bandits. He also strongly denied the American newspapers' claim that Japanese-Russian relations were on the verge of crisis, saying that it was propaganda from those who rejected Japan and Manchuria. The two countries of Japan and Manchuria hope to maintain peace forever.</p>
<h3 id="e95">◎ Zhang Zhen Retreated to Zhao'an Again <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>▲ Red Bandits Set Up Bases in Western and Southern Fujian</p>
<p>▲ And Actively Explore Tong'an and Zhangpu Separately</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The southwest half of Fujian Province has now become the sphere of influence of the Red Bandits. Changting, Liancheng, Longyan, Nan Jing, Longxi, Haicheng, Wuping, Shanghang, Yongding and nine counties have been completely lost. Qingliu, Ninghua, Chong'an, Pucheng, Tong'an and Pinghe are in contention between the government and the bandits. Currently, the bandits have established a base in western Fujian in Changting, where the Soviet Government of Western Fujian and the headquarters of the Seventh Red Army are located, governing Liancheng (Tingzhou), Wuping, Shanghang, and Yongding counties. They have established a base in southern Fujian in Longxi (Zhangzhou), where the Soviet Government of Southern Fujian and the headquarters of the First Red Army Corps are located, governing Longyan, Nan'jing, Haicheng, and Tong'an counties. They are registering households, labeling houses, arresting local gentry and merchants in Zhangzhou City, and distributing money looted from organs and wealthy families to workers and peasants, encouraging them to join the Red Army. Regarding military operations, they are still taking a defensive stance towards Tong'an, holding out with Chen Guohui's brigade of the government army between Jiangdong Bridge, Jiaowei, and Fan. There have been no major changes in recent days. However, people's hearts are very restless in Quanzhou and Tong'an. They are relocating to the countryside, shops are closing, and schools are suspended, making the local area quite chaotic. The situation in Zhangpu is still extremely urgent. Day after day, the Zhangzhou bandits have been setting off in that direction in an endless stream. It is said that the bandits are making a full-scale advance on Zhangpu, advancing from Nan'jing and Haicheng. The government troops in Zhangpu only have one regiment of Zhang Zhen's division, so the situation is also very critical. People are fleeing to Yunxiao, Zhao'an, and Dongshan, and the order is very chaotic. However, according to news from the Security Office, as of the 27th, Zhang's division was still deploying defenses in Zhangpu City and the surrounding suburbs. The rumors of its loss are still difficult to confirm. Zhang Zhen himself originally led a large force in Yunxiao, but now, due to the emergency in Zhangpu, he retreated to Zhao'an again to deploy defenses the day before yesterday. According to Zhang Zhen's telegram to the province, there are about 6,000 people gathered in Zhangpu, Yunxiao, and Zhao'an, and he is planning to hold on and wait for reinforcements. However, in terms of geography, Yunxiao is behind Zhangpu, and Zhao'an is behind Yunxiao. Now that Zhang is retreating further and further back, it is really unpredictable. As for the Guangdong army's support for Fujian, it was originally divided into three routes: the left wing was undertaken by Huang Renhuan's department of the First Independent Division, and Xie Zheng and Ouyang Xin's two regiments of the Eighth Division, and Zhong Shaokui's department of the Newly Compiled First Independent Brigade, entering Wuping from Jiaoling and advancing to Shanghang. The central route was undertaken by Guo Hui and Zhao Lan's two regiments of the Third Army's Training Regiment, entering Fengshi from Dapu and advancing to Yongding. The right wing was undertaken by Huang Tingzhen's department of the Eighth Division, entering Pinghe and Zhao'an from Raoping. At present, only the left wing is advancing into Wuping and Shanghang. The middle and right wings have not yet moved, so they have not been able to make contact immediately. In addition, Fang Shengtao, Chairman of the Provincial Government, Liu Tong, the newly appointed Director of the Civil Affairs Department, He Gongsan, the former Director of the Finance Department, and Jiang Pingfan of the Provincial Committee arrived in the province on April 28. It is said that the specific methods for both the bandit suppression and financial problems have been discussed with the central government during this trip to Beijing. The detailed plan will be recorded again later. (April 29)</p>

<p>▲ The General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the Three Provinces is Established in Nanchang</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: He Yingqin, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Fujian Border Area, along with Xiong Shihui, the Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and all the staff of the General Headquarters, set sail from Beijing on the Jiangda steamboat on April 29th. They arrived in Jiujiang on the morning of the 1st of this month. They then took a special train prepared by the Nanxun Railway and arrived in the provincial capital at 1 p.m. Those who came with He included Chief of Staff He Guoguang and dozens of personnel from the six major departments. The General Headquarters is still located in the Provincial Library. Zhu Shaoliang, the Director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, completed the handover yesterday (the 30th). The staff of the headquarters are all setting up everything inside, and they will officially start working tomorrow (the 2nd). However, the internal organization is very simple, with only one director in each department. It is reported that the military affairs of bandit suppression in Jiangxi Province will focus on the border area between Jiangxi and Fujian in the future, because the main force of the Red Bandits is entrenched in the area of Ruijin, Shicheng, Tingzhou, and Shanghang. Now they are waiting for He's decision before proceeding. (May 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e97">◎ Gao You Tang Impeaches Liu Ruiheng <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>▲ Because Liu Deceived the Government to Form a Tobacco Prohibition Office</p>
<p>▲ In Name, Tobacco Prohibition, But in Reality, Openly Selling Tobacco</p>
<p>The Supervisory Committee member, Gao You Tang, submitted an impeachment against Liu Ruiheng, stating: "Regarding the matter of impeachment, opium's harm to China is worse than floods and fierce beasts. The government, recognizing this, specifically established the Tobacco Prohibition Committee and promulgated the Tobacco Prohibition Punishment Law, which is stricter than the Criminal Law. This shows that the government attaches importance to tobacco prohibition and is determined. Unexpectedly, Liu Ruiheng, the Chairman of the Tobacco Prohibition Committee and concurrently the Director of the Department of Health, has achieved little since taking office, and his performance has greatly declined compared to the era of Zhang Zhijiang, which already constitutes negligence of duty. What is even more astonishing is that he dared to deceive the government and organize the Tobacco Prohibition Investigation Office. The regulations he formulated completely destroyed the powers of the judiciary, administration, and police, handling everything single-handedly. He stipulated that a certain amount of tax would be levied on each tael of opium, calling it tobacco prohibition, but in reality, it was selling tobacco. The directors of the investigation offices he dispatched to various provinces all paid a heavy price. Within less than ten days of opening, they extorted recklessly, and the voices of opposition filled the country. Only then did the government strictly order its cancellation. However, the planting of tobacco in various provinces continued as before, the transportation of tobacco continued as before, the selling of tobacco continued as before, and the smoking of tobacco continued as before. The government's orders were equal to nothing. Liu Ruiheng was not only as deaf and blind, but also tacitly approved the planting, transportation, selling, and smoking of tobacco as a personal opportunity to make money, hoping to make a comeback and revive. People are talking about it, and it is not without reason. The Tobacco Prohibition Law has been promulgated for a long time, how could Liu Ruiheng not know? Yet, he was completely heartless, using his power to openly sell tobacco. The ridicule of various countries was unheard of, and the health of the people was not taken into account. There is nothing more harmful to the country and the people than this. Liu Ruiheng has violated Article 16 and Article 18 of the Tobacco Prohibition Law and is hereby impeached according to the law. Please hand over Liu Ruiheng, the Chairman of the Tobacco Prohibition Committee and concurrently the Director of the Department of Health, for disciplinary action. The criminal part should be transferred to the court for trial. It is also hoped that the government will strictly prohibit the disguised selling of tobacco in the future and not take measures that are like drinking poison to quench thirst, so as to preserve the dignity of the country. It is a great fortune." (April 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">◎ Repeated Bombing Cases in Guangzhou <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Reason is That Bandits Extorted Money Unsuccessfully</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Robbers and bandits in Guangzhou have been rampant in recent days, repeatedly sending letters to various shops extorting huge sums of money. Those who do not comply are harassed by bombs. Initially, the targets of extortion were the various river ferry companies, so the bombing of ships by bandits has been heard of from time to time. Unexpectedly, two bombing incidents causing injuries have occurred recently. One was near the Daji Coal Factory behind the Doufuyong in Huadishan Village. On the morning of the 20th, a huge bomb suddenly exploded, piercing more than a dozen large holes in the wall of the factory's machine department, each hole about a foot wide, and the smaller ones also several inches. Eight windows were completely destroyed. The wooden roots of the fence outside the wall were also completely broken. The broken shell pieces flew to the vicinity, collapsing several pieces of the house wall and injuring the back and feet. After the incident, the military police arrived at the scene to investigate and found a piece of shrapnel more than eight minutes thick, which shows the size of the bomb. At the same time, a manifesto from the bandit leader Liang Gaozhong was found near the corner of a new house, the wording of which was absurd and nothing more than a statement that the extortion was unsuccessful and the bomb was used as a warning. The other incident occurred on the same evening at the Zhongshan Cinema on Xiajiupu Road in Xiguan, where a bombing incident by bandits injured people. On that evening, a guest named Chen Jia, accompanied by his friend Liang Yi, took a seat in the third row of ordinary seats in the theater. Suddenly, they noticed an iron can under the seat, wrapped in paper. Chen did not know what it was and initially did not expect it to be a bomb planted by bandits. When he touched it with his hand, a loud noise suddenly erupted. All five fingers of Chen's left hand were blown off, and blood flowed like a stream. His lower scrotum was also blown open. Chen fainted from the extreme pain, and his injuries were very serious. After the explosion, the entire theater was in chaos. The police and military police rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and searched among the crowd for a long time, but did not find any suspects. They then sent the injured person to the hospital for treatment. However, Chen died only forty minutes after arriving at the hospital due to his serious injuries. After the incident, a bandit letter was found in the hospital, which briefly stated that the matter requested from the theater had been ignored, so the smallest means of punishment were used. If they continued to refuse to hand it over, more violent bombings would be used, and so on. It was signed by Liao Jiruo of the Guangdong Tianyi Hall. It is heard that the theater had repeatedly received extortion letters from Liao before, but the person in charge regarded them as intimidation and ignored them. Unexpectedly, in a prosperous area with the military police standing everywhere, the bandits would actually dare to do this. (April 21st evening)</p>
<h3 id="e99">◎ Establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Association <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>▲ And Election of Standing Committee Members</p>
<p>Due to the outbreak of the war against Japan, the counties of Baoshan, Taicang, and Jiading in Jiangsu Province have fallen into the war zone and suffered severely. The people have been killed, injured, and displaced. The counties in the vicinity of the war zone have also suffered significant military losses indirectly. The government should take measures to provide relief, but the treasury is empty and the economic capacity is weak. The problems of current relief, future rehabilitation, and recovery must be solved by pooling the financial and human resources of the entire province. Therefore, the War Zone Relief Association was specifically organized in order to gather the strengths of all parties. After months of preparation, the members were appointed, and the inaugural meeting was held in the provincial government on April 28th. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The attending members were Zhu Zhongjing, Yin Zhaorong, Zhu Yuanzhi, Guo Songru, Ma Yintang, Cai Zhaozhai, Qian Yizhen, Guo Junfu, Zhao Songping, Huang Zhenhuan, Wang Yibai, Liu Xuzhou, Qian Sunqing, Gao Jiansi, Xue Mingjian, Han Guojun, Xu Dingkang, Zhu Shaowen, Wang Shuxiang, Cheng Jingsheng, Jiang Wenyu, Ma Junqing, Zhang Yipeng, Shi Kuihe, Shen Baoyi, Dong Zengru, Liu Zhiren, Sun Shaojiang, Wang Boqiu, Wang Zhanwei, Ni Zhuhua, Xia Langyun, Yan Suiqiu, Chen Xinming, Liu Zaiji, Wang Qihua, Dai Boyin, Hong Jingping, Jiang Yuren, Xu Jingfu, Yuan Xiluo, Sun Dongwen, Dong Xiujia, Wu Xiangfu, Du Ting _, Zhang Zhijiang (represented by Zhu Chang), Yang Xingqin, Ma Yuanfang, Cao Minghuan, Sun Bowen, Liu Bochang, Yu Xiaochuan, Wang Jingting, Gu Lunan (represented by Zhu Runzhi), Hu Jianchun, Cao Deliang (represented by Yu Xiaochuan), Wang Jingyu, Yang Weiyu, Liu Fuchen, Pan Mengqiao, Yang Hongshu, Pan Zhixing, Zhao Qingyi, Hong Lanxiang, Pang Shusen, Sha Yankai, Wang Kecheng, Cai Huan, Zhao Zhengping, Zhang Gongquan, Huang Boqiao (represented by Zhao Zhengping), Li Bochui, Wang Boquan, Xi Jiuru, Gu Junyi, Chen Yuren, Sun Jiyi, Chen Feishi, Qiu Laizhi (represented by Chen Feishi), Zhao Shuyong, Dong Shoujing, Zhao Zhujun (represented by Zhao Shuyong), Shen Mianhou, Zhu Shuyuan, Leng Yuqiu, Tang Shoumin, Wu Jichen (represented by Leng Yuqiu), Su Qiliu, Yang Mianzhai, Dong Mocha, Wang Lanqing, Wu Yanqiu, Yu Jingtang, Wang Haoru, Zhang Hongye, Jiang Jun, Lu Xiaobo, Gu Jingcheng, Wu Heting, Zhou Fohai, Ouyang Yanqing, Huang Lisan (represented by Ling Huian), He Yushu, Li Mingyang, Shu Shifu, Gu Zhutong, Zhao Qilu, Han Deqin, ninety-seven people in total, as well as representatives and guests, dozens of people, the meeting began at 3 p.m., led by Chairman Gu of the Provincial Government, performed the rituals, and reported on the process of organizing the relief association and the mission it undertakes. Jiang Wenyu moved a motion to mourn the martyrs of the anti-Japanese war and the compatriots who died in the war zone. All stood up and observed a three-minute silence.</p>
<p>▲ Speeches by the members. Then speeches were given by the members, all of which were solemn and tragic. The main points were nothing more than (1) reporting on the miserable conditions of the war zone, (2) that the areas of Jiangsu that were not war zones were affected by the war, with industry and commerce in a state of despair and in need of revitalization, so there was no surplus capacity to save others, (3) that financial stagnation in various counties was due to the concentration of cash in Shanghai, and Shanghai's financial hub had close ties with the central Ministry of Finance, so to seek relief for the war zone, the central government must first make it possible for non-war zones to have financial activity, (4) that it was the inherent duty of the people of Jiangsu to save Jiangsu, but the people of Songhu, Baojia, and Tai were sacrificing for the entire country, so relief should also be requested from the central government at the same time, (5) whether the Chinese nation could fight for survival depended on whether it could endure foreign disasters without being subdued, whether the pain that the Japanese gave our people could be reduced, and whether everything that the Japanese could destroy could be rebuilt to restore it. Today's meeting already has this kind of motivation. Whether it can be used to expand and enrich it, on the one hand, whether the government has political and moral responsibility, and on the other hand, whether the people have moral and national responsibility, (6) that relief for the war zone must first determine the four principles of scope, method, talent, and financial resources, (7) that the government and the people should cooperate and not go down two separate roads, and (8) that the people should demand from the government the "right to survival" and the "right to labor," and should not aimlessly seek unrealistic freedom and equality, because the disease of China lies in irregular excessive freedom and equality.</p>
<p>▲ The motion was organized, and Jiang Wenyu, Leng Yuqiu, Zhu Dexuan, Zhang Yipeng, Yang Weiyu, and Zhao Housheng were appointed as members of the motion organization committee. At 6 p.m., the photo was taken, and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>▲ Formal General Meeting. Starting on the morning of the 29th, the association held a formal meeting. In the morning, they discussed fundraising methods and generally decided to issue public bonds, borrow from banks, and request supplementary allocations from the central government. In the afternoon, they discussed relief and tax exemption cases, and elected standing committee members. Regarding fundraising methods, (1) one million yuan should be allocated first for emergency relief from military disasters, (2) a report should be submitted to the central government to issue 200,000 yuan in war zone relief bonds and allocate 5 million yuan in cash. Before the issuance, disaster relief bonds should be allocated and processed quickly, (3) another 5 million yuan should be raised from various banks for immediate use, and (4) another loan of American wheat should be obtained. Regarding representatives for overseas fundraising, those who are familiar with overseas Chinese must be competent, so they have not been recommended, and it is planned that the standing committee will appoint them. Borrowing from the banking sector for emergency needs will also be handled by the standing committee. Regarding the association's plan to issue military disaster bonds and request the central government to allocate cash, they must petition the Ministry of Finance for consultation and negotiation. Han Zishi, Leng Yuqiu, Zhang Yunbo, Jiang Wenyu, Lin Kanghou, Shi Liangcai, Chen Guangfu, and Zhang Gongquan were recommended to be responsible for this. Subsequently, the standing committee members were elected, including Shi Liangcai, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhu Yinjiang, Mu Ouchu, Tang Weizhi, Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, Zhang Zhongren, Han Zishi, Du Yuesheng, Ma Yuanfang, Gu Mosan, Zhao Cihua, Dong Dingsan, Shu Shiwen, Zhou Fohai, and He Menglin, seventeen people in total. The heads and deputy heads of each group were elected: General Affairs: Jiang Wenyu, Jin Baoguang, Yang Weiyu; Finance: Zhang Gongquan, Wu Yunbao, Shu Shiwen; Design: Zhao Housheng, He Yushu, Dong Xiujia; Relief: Huang Renzhi, Cheng Yiqing, Zhao Qilu; Statistics: Chen Guangfu, Leng Yuqiu, Han Deqin; Audit: Pan Xulun, Jin Houcheng. The standing committee of the Shanghai office of the association was elected as Zhu Ziqiao, Zhang Gongquan, and Shi Liangcai. If Zhu goes north, Chen Guangfu will be replaced. (April 30th)</p>

<p>▲ Traitor Xu Futing Executed by Firing Squad Songjiang Correspondence: Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, there have been ignorant and foolish people who, out of greed for profit, have been raised by the enemy and willingly used. The military and police organs have been conducting strict investigations of such traitors. The other day, a man named Xu Futing from Jiangbei Dongtai was found carrying Japanese steel coins in the area of Xinqiao Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, spying on military intelligence and reporting to the enemy. He was captured by the garrison troops, and evidence of his traitorous activities was found. After interrogation, he also admitted without hesitation that he was spying on military intelligence for the enemy. His crime was heinous and deserved the death penalty. After the report was approved by the commander-in-chief Jiang's telegram, the prisoner was taken to the execution ground and executed by firing squad on the 1st.</p>
<p>▲ Recent Situation in Kunshan After Kunshan was harassed by enemy planes, the residents fled. Now that the military situation has gradually eased, most of them have returned. Pawnshops and businesses have already fully opened, but the business is deserted, while small vendors are making a lot of money. The farmers in the surrounding villages are carrying out their spring farming because our army is kind and approachable. Small steamers to Taicang, Liuhe, Jiaozhi, and other places have been operating normally since the 28th, and navigation in various villages is also unimpeded, just like normal. The reporter went to Tai on a steamer on the 28th to understand the situation in Taicang and saw that the shops in the city were also operating as usual, without any signs of war. It is heard that the farmers in Xiangqiao in the third district are begging for food from wealthy households because they have no food, which is very pitiful. On the morning of the 28th, more than 20 Japanese soldiers arrived at Pailoushi and stayed for an hour before leaving. In the afternoon, they returned to Kunshan on the original steamer. On the way through Qingyang Port, they saw that our army's defense was solid and the morale was high, but in order to prevent spies from mixing in, the inspection was quite strict.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Planes Fly Over Pinghu for Reconnaissance Pinghu Correspondence: Today (the 1st) at 9:40 a.m., a Japanese plane flew from the Jiashan area for low-altitude reconnaissance and circled the city. It happened to be the first day of the opening of the county's fifth sports meeting, and more than 10,000 people gathered on the field. They hurried to disperse to avoid danger.</p>
<p>▲ Restaurant Industry Appeals for Donation of Banquet Education Tax The Wuxi Banquet Education Tax was taken over by Qian Yinzai last September. All banquet taxes in the urban area were contracted by 27 restaurants as a whole, totaling 700 yuan per month, payable in three installments. Within the five months of the contract, they were still able to barely pay on time. However, since the start of the Shanghai war, the restaurant business has plummeted. Five restaurants, including Daxinlou, Daqinglou, Yongxinglou, Yuebinlou, and Xinjuxing, have closed down one after another, which has affected the tax revenue. Even those who have not closed down have not been able to pay the tax as before due to the slow business. Therefore, since this tax revenue is related to education funding, a special request has been submitted to the county government to strictly pursue the payment and order the restaurant guild to pay off the arrears in full within five days. The restaurant guild has written to the Chamber of Commerce to appeal and has repeatedly stated the difficulties, requesting the Chamber of Commerce to transfer the matter to the tax collection office and pay 20% of the contract amount from February 1st of this year, otherwise, they request that someone be sent to directly check the accounts and collect the tax in order to avoid losses and sympathize with the merchants' difficulties.</p>
<p>Jiangbei Bandit Xia Heshang Captured Nantong Correspondence: Xia Heshang, the famous bandit leader in Jiangbei Tongru counties, was captured after he escaped to Pingchao on the 30th, after assembling people and committing arson, robbery, and murder in multiple cases that had been wanted by the provincial and county governments without success. He was captured by the police and sent to the county government that night to be interrogated by the Pacification Military Law Office.</p>
<p>▲ Liang Guanying Thoroughly Investigates Extortion Case Nantong Correspondence: Liang Guanying, the commander-in-chief of the 25th Route Army, felt alarmed and dumbfounded by the case of extortion of huge sums of money under the guise of the army in Tongcheng. He ordered the Chief Inspectorate stationed in Tong to thoroughly investigate. The principal offender, Li Yezhong, is at large and has been wanted.</p>
<p>▲ Problems Still Exist for Opening of Money Industry Nantong Correspondence: The Nantong money industry has not yet resumed business, mainly because the accounts released cannot be recovered, and the transactions with various banks and villages in Shanghai have not been settled. The total amount owed by large and small firms is around 2.5 million yuan. Therefore, the settlement of accounts is the prerequisite for the current situation. As a result of the continuous meetings of the money industry, they will first start with the collection of money, and at the same time send representatives to negotiate with the financial circles in Shanghai and Zhenjiang to determine the date of listing.</p>
<p>▲ Murderer of Seventeen Lives Captured Gaoyou Correspondence: Bai Weixiang, the head of Gongtian Township in the second district of the county, was accused of killing seventeen civilians. The families of the deceased had successively sued the county government, and the county government questioned and detained Bai after three summons. Now, Jiang Changzhong, the family member of the deceased, unintentionally saw Bai Weixiang's eldest son Changxu, second son Changkun, and Zhang Mingzhi, the accomplice, at the Zhenjiang Railway Station. He immediately reported to the railway police, who arrested them and sent them to the Provincial Public Security Bureau for transfer to the local court for trial. A special letter was sent to this county yesterday to welcome the extraction. The county government has ordered the bailiffs to go and welcome the extraction, return to the case for trial.</p>
<p>▲ Suzhou All Circles Mourn Xiao Te, The Aviator Xiao Te, flew his own plane this time and chased six Japanese planes at Gaodian Village in Suzhou, and died tragically. All circles in Wuxian specially initiated a meeting to mourn. The memorial service was held at the public stadium at 10 am on the 28th. About 10,000 representatives and people from all walks of life and groups attended. On the Western side, Mr. and Mrs. Wen Naishi, Dyson, Alersu, Lanshafei, and Mr. and Mrs. Bakmon, more than 30 people also arrived. After the meeting was held as usual, Chairman Wang Lingxiao reported on the preparations, and representatives from various groups such as Song Youpei spoke. Mr. Wen Naishi, representative of the Western people, delivered a reply on behalf of all the American Chinese, advocating world peace, opposing the use of force to invade, and promoting the idea of ​​the world as a family. The meeting was then adjourned. On that day, all circles in the city lowered their flags at half-mast to show their condolences. All circles decided to build a pavilion for the martyr Xiao in the park and set up a Chinese standard pillar in the place where he was killed to commemorate his memory.</p>

<p>▲ Publicly Printing and Distributing Leaflets to Attract Gamblers</p>
<p>▲ Saying the Protection is Comprehensive and the Hospitality is Thoughtful</p>
<p>Zhabei has been occupied by the Japanese army for several months now, and unscrupulous traitors such as Hu Lifu and Chang Yuqing are blatantly carrying out activities under the guise of violent protection. At first, they illegally organized the "Shanghai North City People's Local Maintenance Association," levying taxes and extorting money in every way, which was criticized by all countries and caused public uproar. In order to save face, the Japanese did not hesitate to release and then restrain, and once temporarily abolished the puppet association. Unexpectedly, they have intensified their activities recently. The traitors have openly established casinos, brothels, and opium dens. In recent days, the results have been even more remarkable. In fact, anyone who comes to Zhabei can feel the three major characteristics of domino sounds, salty meat odor, and opium aroma anytime and anywhere. Yesterday, the reporter happened to visit a friend in a large hotel and suddenly found two strange cards. The paper was pink and brightly colored. One was about three inches long and two inches wide, and the other was the same length but one-third narrower. Both were printed with gold characters in the official script. After reviewing the full text, it was learned that it was a novel leaflet in the form of an advertisement for a large-scale casino newly established in the Japanese-occupied area. A special edition was attached, and the original text is recorded below to prove the bizarre phenomenon in Zhabei under the Japanese power. One paper is printed with "Recently, the situation has gradually stabilized, and order has been restored. Our company has specially opened a club to meet the entertainment needs of the public. It is equipped with all kinds of gambling games, and the interior decoration is gorgeous. Protection is safe, tea, cigarettes, wine and water, the hospitality is thoughtful. Cars are provided for pick-up and drop-off. All circles of gentry and ladies are welcome to visit in their spare time. Sincerely, Dali Company Club." On the back, it is also printed with words such as "Note: Gambling games are welcome to visit." Another paper is printed with "The visiting address is No. 118 Derunli, Linping Road, at the end of Fair Road." When the Japanese see this, it is unknown how they will explain it.</p>

<p>▲ American Chinese Are Very Indignant</p>
<p>The Mainland Daily reported that American Hibbert, an employee of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession's Bureau of Public Works, lived on Jiangwan Road. After being arrested by Japanese soldiers last Friday, he was released after negotiations by the American Consul General. He has now moved with his family to the Public Concession for safety. According to Hibbert, when the bombing occurred in Hongkou Park, Japanese soldiers chased two photographers from a photo shop on Nanjing Road to his home. He did not come out to stop them or try to protect the two Chinese. However, the Japanese soldiers arrested him without asking the reason, tied his hands behind his back, and took him to the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps without giving him a chance to explain. When he arrived at the headquarters, he immediately told a translator that he was an American and asked to be released, otherwise, he would be transferred to the American authorities. The Japanese ignored him. After being severely interrogated and detained for two hours, he was finally released after negotiations by the American Consulate General. However, according to the Japanese side, Hibbert had tried to protect the two Chinese, so he was also arrested. The place of arrest was not within the Public Concession. The American Chinese in this port are extremely indignant at Hibbert's arrest and detention and severe interrogation by the Japanese military authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e106">◎ Anti-Drug Association Asks Central Government to Announce a Ban on Opium Policy <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>▲ Only Three Provinces Remain Without Public Sales</p>
<p>▲ News of Central Government Public Sales as Well</p>
<p>The Republic of China Anti-Drug Association, due to the recent rush by various provinces to implement public opium sales, and the news that the central government is also considering restoring the public sales system, yesterday sent a letter to Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, requesting a clear announcement of the central government's opium prohibition policy, so that the public can understand the truth. The original letter is recorded below: "Extremely Urgent. Respectfully presented to Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Luoyang. Our country is plagued by internal difficulties and disasters, and is subjected to external insults and plundering. Wounds have not healed, and collapse is still feared. However, the military and political authorities of various provinces, disregarding the imminent demise of the country, are still only seeking profit. They are relentlessly pursuing the opium public sales system, which will destroy the country and exterminate the race. Fujian and Anhui started it first, followed by Yunnan, Hubei, Hebei, Suiyuan, Chahar, and Rehe. The corruption is rampant, and the whole country is in a frenzy. Except for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shandong provinces, which have not implemented public sales, all other provinces are gradually implementing it, helping each other in their chaos, disregarding the lives of the people, destroying the prohibition laws, and showing the utmost contempt. Yet the central government remains deaf and silent, without uttering a word, leading corrupt officials to become emboldened and opium addicts to become daring. They say that if it were not for the central government's indulgence and tolerance, this would not have happened. Rumors of the central government's brewing of opium public sales revival have been circulating for some time. At this time of national crisis and widespread anxiety, just when the central government is restoring corrupt policies, rumors are flying, seemingly not without cause. Public sentiment is wavering, and public opinion is boiling. The danger of collapse and disintegration is lurking everywhere. You, sir, are a revolutionary predecessor, a follower of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, and hold a central position, from which government orders are issued. You should be building merits for the Party and the country, presiding over major plans, promoting benefits and eliminating evils. Furthermore, when the central government implemented public sales in the past, and mass organizations launched protests, you, sir, presided over the Guangdong government and were the first to express opposition. Your firm and upright spirit, I trust, is still strong. You will not have a protective heart towards this policy of indulging in poison. I dare to ask you, sir, to be open and honest, and announce the central government's opium prohibition policy and measures to stop the implementation of public sales in various provinces, so that the public can understand the truth, dispel doubts, comfort public opinion, and maintain national discipline. If you, sir, can make a prompt and decisive decision to strongly advocate for opium prohibition, assist the central government, and change policies, then this association and the entire nation will wholeheartedly support you and praise you endlessly. I await your orders with bated breath. The Republic of China Anti-Drug Association bows in respect. Jiang [seal]."</p>
<h3 id="e107">◎ Public Concession Crime Prevention Fund <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>In 1927 (the 16th year of the Republic), the number of criminal cases in Shanghai increased significantly. At that time, several Chinese individuals wrote to the Municipal Council, praising the efforts of the police officers and seeking ways to express their encouragement. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Municipal Council, the Chief of Police, and the Chief of Finance suggested initiating a fund, named the Special Fund for Crime Prevention. In January of the following year, the Municipal Council announced the start of collecting donations, which were entirely voluntary. Each donor was given a number, but their names were not publicized. The donations were used to hire special detectives, reward diligent police officers, reward informants, and provide compensation for those injured or killed. Thus, the Crime Prevention Fund was established. The details of its operation were scattered in the Municipal Gazette of December 1927 and January and February of the following year.</p>
<p>In March 1928, three Chinese individuals were publicly selected to serve as members of the Fund Committee. These three gentlemen have served continuously for four years and have held a total of sixteen meetings. All bonuses issued have been approved by the committee. In total, over 30,000 yuan in bonuses have been issued in the past four years. In addition, the committee has made other suggestions and contributions to the police department. The secretary of the committee is Mr. Ayers of the police department.</p>
<p>In May 1929, the Fund Committee first suggested adding motorcycles and increasing the number of police officers to combat robbers and kidnappings. Due to the large amount of money required, after much deliberation and discussion, in January 1931, the Municipal Council formulated a kidnapping prevention plan. The general outline was to establish telephones on the roads, purchase wireless police cars, add car and motorcycle teams, establish a special plainclothes police force, and set up a reserve team in the western district. This plan has been gradually implemented.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Fund Committee, within four years, a total of 547 bonuses have been issued, with 316 people receiving less than 50 yuan, 205 people receiving between 50 and 100 yuan, 17 people receiving between 100 and 200 yuan, and 5 people receiving between 200 and 350 yuan. In addition, compensation was given to the families of four police officers who died in the line of duty, each family receiving 500 yuan. The cases involved a total of 268 cases, including 36 armed kidnappings, 22 murders and attempted murders, 109 robberies and attempted robberies, 13 burglaries, 26 snatchings, 4 threatening letters, 27 illegal possession of firearms, 1 abduction, 16 thefts, 4 pickpocketing cases, and 10 other cases.</p>
<p>Among those who received bonuses and prizes were a 12-year-old boy who was a shop owner, a chauffeur, a garbage collector, a rickshaw puller, the wife of the victim, a bodyguard, a doorman, a shop assistant, a Russian shop assistant, a foreigner, a foreign soldier, and other upper-class people, as well as many informants. Some of those who did not accept money were given silver shields, silver cigarette cases, or couplets. From the variety of recipients, one can see the wide scope of the committee's work. In addition, the committee distributed tens of thousands of flyers and hired people to explain the key points of theft prevention to the public.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, this fund has received a total of 65,599.37 yuan in donations and 9,169.47 yuan in interest, totaling 74,768.84 yuan. In the past four years, a total of 30,490 yuan has been spent. As of the end of 1931, there was a remaining balance of 44,278.84 yuan.</p>

<p>Xiang Sheng Automobile Company was originally founded solely by Zhou Xiang Sheng, a Ningbo businessman in Shanghai. Since its establishment ten years ago, its business has been quite prosperous. Recently, considering the lack of a large-scale automobile company founded entirely by Chinese, he specially invited Ningbo gentlemen He Jingshan, Li Binchen, Yang Wenshou, Wang Zhengqu, and Zhou Zhiqing to join him, increasing the capital by 100,000 yuan and reorganizing it into a limited liability company. In addition to the existing 30 Buick automobiles, 50 new 1932 Chevrolet sedans were added. It is said that all the drivers have been re-trained and have reliable guarantors. They treat customers with courtesy. Five branches have been added in busy areas such as the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road and the Continental Department Store. The telephone number has been changed to 40000. The fare is one yuan for each pick up and drop off, regardless of distance, and three yuan per hour. He Jingshan was appointed chairman of the board, and Zhou Xiang Sheng was appointed general manager, in order to compete with a certain large company. Although the cars are not domestically produced, they do recover some of the profit rights. Fellow countrymen, please support them.</p>

<p>The Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Factory in Hongkou employs many male and female workers. However, most of the workers reside in Pudong. Every day, they go out early and return late, and more than a thousand people travel back and forth on sampans and ferries from the Xiaonanyang wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong. As a result, there are also four or five hundred sampan and ferry boatmen who rely on this for their livelihood. For many years, they have lived in peace. However, recently, a local man named Yan Shaosheng coveted the rich income of the wharf and rented two small steam launches, intending to eliminate the sampan and ferry boats altogether. Yesterday morning, around four o'clock, he sailed the steam launches to the Lujiazui wharf and began operating. The sampan and ferry boatmen, fearing that their livelihoods would be taken away, gathered more than a hundred sampans and ferries, surrounded the steam launches, and, accompanied by their elders and children, questioned Yan face-to-face to protect the livelihoods of hundreds of people. Although there were police officers at the scene, they deeply understood the plight of the boatmen. After people tried their best to mediate, Yan realized that he had insufficient grounds and quickly ordered the steam launches to leave the wharf.</p>

<p>▲ Sentenced to One Year and Two Months in Prison</p>
<p>A-liu, also known as Cui Bao, the youngest daughter of Ye Huang, an old local woman living in a bungalow at Kangjili, Kangti Road, in the French Concession, was scheduled to marry Chen Qiao, an accountant at the Mayer Silk Weaving Factory, on the 11th of last month. Ye Huang had prepared a dowry of thousands of yuan for her daughter, including clothing and jewelry. This aroused the jealousy of her eldest daughter-in-law, Ye Zhang, who resented her mother-in-law for spending so much money on her daughter's wedding. On the 7th of last month, Ye Zhang demanded 3,000 yuan from her mother-in-law but was unsuccessful. That night, at 10 o'clock, Zhang took advantage of her mother-in-law's sleep and sneaked into her room, biting her mother-in-law's lower body. Not satisfied, the next morning, she burned all of her sister-in-law's wedding clothes and took away the gold jewelry. The case was reported to the police station, and Detective Zhu Caicheng arrested Zhang and sent her to the Second Special District Court. The police station charged her with injuring a senior relative and destruction of property, based on Articles 293, 298, and 382 of the Criminal Code. The plaintiff also hired a lawyer to represent her and requested an incidental private prosecution to recover the destroyed clothing and stolen jewelry. The case was repeatedly heard by Wang Gangxu, the head of the criminal court, together with clerk Zhu Chengzhuo and prosecutor Wu Xiaoke. The defendant was defended by a lawyer. After the debate was concluded, the date for the verdict was set, as reported earlier. Yesterday was the day of the verdict. The plaintiff and her lawyer arrived at the court to await the announcement. At 10:00 AM, Judge Wang arrived at the criminal court and ordered the defendant to be brought to the court. After a brief interrogation, the verdict was announced: Ye Zhang was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment for injuring a senior relative. The number of days of detention before the judgment is final will be credited at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. The part of the incidental civil suit will be transferred to the civil court for trial. It is said that the defendant is still dissatisfied with the verdict and wants to file an appeal. The sensational case of intergenerational conflict has temporarily come to an end.</p>

<p>▲ Arms and Legs Covered with Scars</p>
<p>▲ Owner Fined, Maid Sent to Charity</p>
<p>Yu Hu, a woman from Wuxi residing at No. 392 Xiamen Road, bought a 12-year-old Wuxi girl, Wu Baodi, as a maid last winter for 20 yuan. However, Yu Hu had a very violent temper and often beat her. The night before last, at 2:30 AM, she again beat Wu with a wooden stick for some reason. After Wu cried out for help, Mao Zhaolong, who lived in the same house, could not bear it and reported it to the Laozha Police Station. Chinese Detective Feng Xiushan was sent to investigate. He found Yu's door locked, and Wu was crying inside. He broke down the door and found the girl tied to the window frame. He untied her and arrested Yu at the nearby paint shop, bringing her and the rope and wooden stick to the police station. The police chief ordered her to be detained, and Wu was sent to the hospital. The doctor examined her and found scars on her arms, legs, and back, and issued a medical certificate. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case, and the maid, Wu Baodi, complained about the abuse, saying that she did not want to go back with her mistress and wanted to go to the Jiliang Institute to study. Defendant Yu Hu confessed that she often stole copper coins, so she had given her a slight beating, but claimed that the girl was bought as an adopted daughter, not as a slave. Without any debate from her lawyer, Judge Zhou Han examined the confession and ruled that Yu Hu was guilty of illegal imprisonment and injury, and fined her 80 yuan. Wu was sent to the Jiliang Institute to be cared for, and the rope and wooden stick were confiscated.</p>

<p>▲Tomorrow at 10:00 AM</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, several middle schools in the war zone, such as Guangzhong, Shibei, Lida, Chizhi, Aiguo, Nanyang Commercial High School, and China Women's Physical Education College, have been burned down, resulting in significant losses. It is now reported that these schools have scheduled a joint meeting at 10:00 AM on May 5th (Thursday) at Nanyang Commercial High School in Weifengli, west of the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Tongfu Road, to discuss remedial measures after the disaster. However, it is feared that the number of secondary schools affected by the disaster is more than just these few, so all affected secondary schools can send one representative to attend at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e130">◎Large-Scale North China Games Venue <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>-A Glimpse of Various Architectural Designs-</p>
<p>(Kaifeng Correspondence) The 16th North China Games will be held in Kaifeng this autumn. Although it is a time of national crisis, construction is still actively underway. The venue is large-scale and has everything that is needed, including a running track, long jump pits, changing rooms for male and female athletes, a football field, a tennis court, a volleyball and basketball court, a grandstand, a spectator stand, fences, a swimming pool, staff rooms, a gym, offices, a children's playground, a skating rink, and a horticultural area, covering a very large area. The organizing committee has also compiled and printed "Explanation of Detailed Drawings of the Sports Venue," which is now published and details the plans for various constructions at the venue. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>▲The straight length of the running track is 220 meters, the circumference is 400 meters, the width of the straight length is 12 meters, which can be divided into 12 lanes. The width of the circumference is 8 meters, which can be divided into 8 lanes for running 400 meters and 400-meter hurdles. The distance between the outer perimeter of the running track and the grandstand is 4 meters, with a fence in between.</p>
<p>▲The long jump pit, high jump pit, pole vault pit, and long jump pit should be separated because the North China Games are divided into high school, middle school, and women's divisions and must be held simultaneously in different parts and items.</p>
<p>▲The size of the football field is stipulated to be 50 to 100 yards wide and 100 to 130 yards long. The boundary of this field is 80 meters wide (equivalent to 88 yards) and 110 meters long (equivalent to 120 yards). The distance between the field and the grandstand is 10 meters. The north is 6 meters from the fence and the south is 10 meters from the wire mesh. It can also be used as a baseball field and a softball field.</p>
<p>▲Tennis Court Tennis competitions are divided into singles and doubles. Each unit can have two groups of singles players and one group of doubles players competing at the same time. Therefore, there must be at least six tennis courts. This court is built according to the legally prescribed size, 36 feet wide and 78 feet long. The distance between the two courts is 4 meters. The distance between the side of the court and the grandstand is 7 meters. The distance between both ends of the court and the wire mesh is 6.5 meters.</p>
<p>▲Basketball and Volleyball Courts There are three basketball courts, each 15 meters (50 feet) wide and 28.60 meters (94 feet) long. The distance between the two courts is 5 meters. The distance between both ends and the wire mesh and fence is also 5 meters. The distance between the side of the court and the grandstand is 6.5 meters. There are two volleyball courts, each 11 meters wide and 22 meters long. The distance between the two courts and the basketball court is 5 meters. The distance between the court and the grandstand is 6.5 meters. One end is 6 meters from the wire mesh, and the other end is 10 meters from the sample pole. According to the North China volleyball competition, it is divided into high school, middle school, and women's divisions, and the size of the field is also different. The maximum dimension is the predetermined number. If the three divisions compete at the same time, the two courts will definitely not be enough. If necessary at the time, the basketball court can be temporarily converted into a volleyball court. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e131">Gold Standard Soars Alarmingly <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>▲Another Increase of 8 Taels and 2 Mace</p>
<p>▲Buying Frenzy, Shorts Painfully Cover Yesterday, the gold market was only open for half a day, but the rise of the gold standard was even more severe, with a rapid trend. From morning to noon, there was a turnover of 14 taels. During this period, there were large increases and small corrections. The morning market saw a decline, mainly due to a slight drop in the silver market, as well as the deteriorating situation between Japan and Russia, and rumors that the European war debt issue could be extended. The above news was enough to lower gold prices. Afterwards, a sudden peak appeared. Suddenly, it was heard that a large amount of cash was being transported for export, and a certain bank repeatedly opened positions. As for foreign exchange, both official and unofficial rates were tight, which led to a firm sentiment among the public, and the buying frenzy in various firms. The general short side painfully covered their positions, and the market price had a tendency to soar to the skies, already piercing the new price of 740 taels. With unparalleled sharpness, the final surge was more than 8 taels. The details of the morning market are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Morning Opening Once Declined At the beginning of the morning, the June contract immediately fell 9 mace to 736 taels. Although the large strips fell by 16 3/8 points, the silver price only fell by 1/8, and private telegrams only fell by 1/16, so it was not considered a move. Then it fell to 35.5 taels. Yuhe, Yuanmaoyong slightly advanced and immediately added to 37 taels. However, the exchange rate was not tight. The June U.S. dollar rate of 30.04375 could be bought and sold. In addition, Hengyu, Bingxing, and Richang sold. At 9 o'clock, it was about 34 taels, and the listing was not changed. Then, the Dalian gang and Shechang and others bought in at 36 taels and 3 mace. Suddenly, rumors spread that the war debt would be extended, and in the future, it could be repaid in silver. At the same time, news came that Japan and Russia were in contact. Because of this, Tong Taichang, Zhifengyong, Hengyu, Zhaofengchang and others all dumped their positions, and the price plummeted by 4 taels, ending at 32 taels.</p>
<p>▲Rumor that a Certain Bank is Absorbing Cash and Transporting it Overseas Afterwards, it was heard that a certain bank was buying spot goods and that a large amount of money was being shipped overseas. Buyers in the market began to move. Fuchang, Yongfeng, Hengchangyong, Futaiheng, Hongkangyong, Wanxing, Kaitai and others happily purchased. Furthermore, Wahbi absorbed 875 British gold in July and also imported 625 U.S. dollars, and then became even stronger. Therefore, the price soared, and the flying surge was more than 8 taels. At almost 10 o'clock, it was 40 taels and 7 qian. However, Zhifengyong and Tong Taichang were still selling non-stop, conceding more than one tael, for 39 taels. Before long, the exchange rate was even tighter. The near-term U.S. dollar was only calculated at 30 yuan on the border. Fuchang, Shunli, Yongfeng, Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Hongkangyong, Dadecheng and others eagerly purchased. In an instant, it rushed out of 40 taels again. It was also rumored that the Sino-Japanese armistice conference had been signed, and people's hearts were even more stable. From 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock, it rose by a total of 5 taels, to 44 taels. There were few ups and downs in one hour, only about 2 taels. The shorts sold out by the zero account, and the price sharply fell by 2 taels and a half, to 41 and a half taels. Because HSBC's listing was reduced by one notch, calculated as 25 British gold and 375 U.S. dollars, it immediately rose to 45 taels, and the inner plate was even firmer. The current month's U.S. dollar traded against 875, and then British gold was only settled at 625 to 6875. At 11:30, Hengyu and Qianchangxiang sold, retreating to 43 taels and 角.</p>
<p>▲A New Price of 46 Taels Appears Moreover, Hengxing, Hengyu, Wanxing and others worked hard to advance, and the short sellers continued to cover their positions, which was greatly stimulated. A new price of 46 taels has appeared, almost 29.75 for the near-term U.S. dollar and 17625 for British gold. When the market closed at noon, it was 45 taels and 1 mace, an increase of 8 taels and 2 mace compared to the previous noon. According to the previous market, the maximum was 46 taels and the minimum was 32 taels, with a turnover of 14 taels. The initial revealed price was 800 taels as before, calculated as pressing 645 taels to 68 taels, then 567 taels. Then it was changed to 810 taels, calculated as pressing 645 taels. The registration and water replenishment are both 45 taels, and the bare strip is calculated to add 5 taels.</p>
<p>▲A Glimpse of Over-the-Counter Transactions Over-the-counter transaction statistics: Fuchang, Yuanheng, Shunli, Hengxing, Yuantai, Yongfeng, Futaiheng, Wanxing, and Yuhe all advanced. Yifengyong, Tong Taichang, Bingxing, and Zhifengyong all sold. Hengyu and Hongkangyong pulled over and then advanced. Moreover, all short sellers were in a hurry to cover their positions. The income and expenditure of other firms are very different.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Exchange Market Exceptionally Tight <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American exchange rates rebounded, and the British and American rates only rose slightly. HSBC's first listing showed no changes in the British, American, and Hong Kong exchange rates. Only the Indian and German rates each rose by 25 francs plus 1 yuan. At 11:15, it was suddenly changed and reduced by one notch, calculated as 25 British gold, now 1 shilling, 7 pence, 10 and a half. The U.S. dollar was 375, for 29 yuan and 625. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still 76 taels and 625. The Indian exchange rate was reduced by 1 and a half yuan, the French franc was 10 yuan, the German exchange rate was reduced by 1.75 yuan, the Japanese yen was reduced by 75, and the Singapore dollar was increased by 1 tael and 7 qian 5. Because of this, the gold price soared, breaking through the 740 tael mark. The bank's transaction price was still flat in the morning, and then frequently tightened. The U.S. dollar has already broken through the 30 yuan mark, with unparalleled sharpness. As a result, it shrank by 625 compared to the previous noon, and British gold also shrank by 3125. Chinese merchants' transactions were not active, in fact, the market was too expensive, making it difficult to respond. It is estimated that about 450,000 pounds of British gold were traded, and the gold firms slightly profited. However, the Bombay telegram sold 7 months, and the U.S. dollar totaled 340,000 yuan, and the various firms sold slightly, and the banks also traded against each other. The American bank sold off this month, and the market closed in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲The British Exchange Inner Plate Had a Turnover of 25 in Half a Day From the early market selling price of 1 shilling, 7 pence, 875, the buying price was 9375, and the noon closing selling price was 625, and the buying price was 6875. The swap seems to be straightened.</p>
<p>▲The U.S. Exchange Inner Plate Had a Turnover of 6875 in the Morning and Noon The difference between near and distant periods is 1875 to 25, which seems to be closer than last week. From the opening selling price in the early morning, May was 30 yuan and 04375, June was half a yuan, July was 5625, August was 625, the buying price was 5625 to 75, and the noon closing selling price was May 29 yuan and 75, June was 8125, July was 9375, August was 30 yuan, and the buying price was 29 yuan 875 to 30 yuan 125. The listing was also 1 yuan, and the initial silver was still equal to 3 taels 3 qian 3 fen 33, which was changed to 3 taels 3 qian 7 fen 555 at noon.</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Large Strip Decline Has Not Weakened <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 3rd, the closing price of large strips declined again, with the near-term price at 16 pence 5625 and the distant-term price at 16 pence 6875, each down 125 from the previous day. The London exchange rate against New York opened at 3 yuan 66 and a half points.</p>
<h3 id="e134">The Cents Market is Gradually Showing Improvement <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>

The current situation does arouse great interest in businessmen from all industries, and the progress in business is increasing. The use of silver dollars is becoming more繁, but silver funds are still restricted by the financial community because the closing period has not passed (end of May), and cannot be extended. However, it has扯自如 (free to use as one pleases), unlike the previous situation of 捉襟見肘 (unable to make ends meet).</p>
<p>▲Cent Disassembly Price "Foreign Cent" The cent price in the early market suddenly soared by 4 and a half li due to the great popularity of the people, and there were already 7 qian and 9 li.

It is indeed a turning point in the market. "Silver Disassembly" Both the early and noon markets were unified to 2 points, and the cut was always white. Because衬 was too much, even a white cut had to be received with a promotion.</p>
<p>▲Currency Conversion Market Situation The Jiangnan small foreign currency increased again in the early morning because the noon market fell too much the day before, and was the same as the early market the day before, at 6 qian 1 fen 1 li.

Copper coins shrank by 3,000 wen to 417,500 wen.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Securities and Public Debt Rose in the Morning and Turned Tired in the Afternoon <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲Troop Reduction Achievement Rose to the Stop, Remaining Also Slightly Firm</p>
<p>▲Transaction of 3,575,000</p>
<p>Yesterday (3rd), the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange bond market was quite active in spot transactions, with a total of 168,000 yuan. Among them, the unified salt tax, 19 customs, and good 20 rolls each had tens of thousands of yuan. The futures market was also slightly active, with 1,975,000 yuan in the morning and 1,600,000 yuan in the afternoon, totaling 3,575,000 yuan. Among them, 20 customs, rolls, unified supervision tax, and first-name customs each had 560,000 yuan. As for the trend of each bond price, in the two sessions in the morning, the market sentiment was good and the demand was not lonely, which caused the performance to rise quite vigorously compared with the previous day. For example, 20 customs, rolls, unified supervision tax, and salt tax each rose by about 3 yuan. However, the popularity in the later market gradually became inferior to the previous one, and the sales momentum of zero accounts turned enthusiastic. The buying momentum was slightly weakened, and the market suddenly showed an oversupply. Each bond then turned tired, and the price fell across the board compared with the previous market. For example, the 19 customs, good, 20 customs, rolls, unified salt tax, and each fell by more than 1 yuan. However, the result was generally still higher than the previous day, except for the troop reduction in May, which rose to the stop at the beginning of the morning. The 20 rolls and salt tax rose by more than 2 yuan, and the others also rose by about 1 yuan. The customs duty compilation and the 19 customs had very slight ups and downs.

<h3 id="e136">Heavy Pressure on Yarn and Cotton Market <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, all industries have been greatly affected. The yarn and cloth exchange was closed for three months and has now officially reopened the day before yesterday. Before the bidding for standard yarn began, it was widely expected that the price would be around 160 taels because the new standard was changed to 20 counts, raised by one grade. Unexpectedly, American cotton has recently experienced a sharp drop, putting even greater pressure. In addition, actual sales have been sluggish, and all parties are lifeless. Financial resources are drying up, and the situation in the interior is weakening, resulting in weak purchasing power from all sides. As a result, the yarn inventories of factories in Shanghai are gradually increasing, and Japanese factories have resumed operations and are working hard on production. Domestic yarn also has many strong competitors. According to market records for April, the total cotton yarn purchased by various groups was only over 10,000 bales. Due to all these reasons, the market unanimously views prices as low. The opening price of new standard yarn this month was only 155 taels and 3 mace, about 2 taels higher than the old standard price before January 28. Now, due to weak actual demand and a bad overall environment, the price has fallen by 1 tael this month alone.</p>
<p>▲ Standard Yarn Selling Pressure Rises: The market atmosphere for new standard yarn at the exchange was flat at the opening. Very few transactions took place in the market. Near-term prices fell by 2 mace over the past two months, while far-term prices rose by 2 mace. In the afternoon, due to excessive inventory this month, selling pressure was strong, with near-term prices falling by 1 tael and 2 mace, and far-term prices falling by 7 or 8 mace. The total trading volume for the day was only 6,600 bales, compared to 23,600 bales the previous day. It was found that 600 bales were sold by Taixing, 400 bales by Yiyu, 850 bales by Guangfeng, and 350 bales by Renfeng. 350 bales were purchased by Ruidai, 450 bales by Changfeng, and 250 bales by Xiesheng. The market prices of egg whites before and after the human standard are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Pre-Market Close        Change      Post-Market Close       Change</p>
<p>July:                   154.7                   Drop 0.2        153.7                   Drop 0.1</p>

<p>August:                  155.1                                   154.3                   Drop 0.8</p>
<p>October:              155.8                   Rise 0.1        155.2                   Drop 0.7</p>
<p>▲ Yarn Sales Turn Sluggish: Sales of spot yarn are relatively sluggish. Except for North sales, which are still good, sales to other regions are limited. According to statistics, the previous day's sales to the Zhejiang group totaled 700 bales, with 72 bales going to inland areas, 290 bales to the North, 45 bales to Sichuan, 25 bales to Jiangxi, 152 bales to Wenzhou, 20 bales to Ningbo, 10 bales to Shantou, 5 bales to Fujian, and 20 bales to Guangdong. Prices fell by 2.5 to 5 mace.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Slight Rebound in Cotton Prices <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly firmer, but actual demand remains sluggish. Factory appetite is very weak. Although gold prices have risen, American and Indian cotton prices have plummeted. Last year, the lowest price for American spot cotton was 5.5 cents. Current indications suggest that new low prices are likely to reappear, causing market pessimism. Fortunately, Shanghai has low inventories of local cotton, keeping the overall situation favorable. However, inventories of foreign cotton are ample. Before the bidding for new standard cotton, it was widely expected that the opening price would be around 2 taels and 7 or 8 mace, as the standard was changed to fine lint, raised by one grade. The price of Huo Ji (Fire Engine) grade cotton is approximately 1 tael and 7 mace to 3 taels lower. Unexpectedly, the opening price the day before yesterday was only 31 taels and 8 mace and 5 fen, which is why yarn prices fell today, while cotton prices saw a slight rebound. However, judging from the overall global trend, the outlook remains pessimistic.</p>
<p>▲ Han Standard Market Atmosphere More Bullish: At the opening of the Han Standard Exchange, market conditions were flat. Near-term prices initially fell by 5 fen, then rose by 5 fen. In the afternoon, there was some buying interest, and the market atmosphere became more bullish, with near-term prices rising by 5 fen, and far-term prices rising by 1 mace and 5 fen to 2 mace and 5 fen. The total trading volume for the day was 15,500 dan, compared to 52,000 dan the previous day. The opening and closing prices of standard cotton are listed below:</p>

<p>▲ No Spot Cotton Transactions Reported: Spot cotton business is quiet. Factories are showing a sluggish attitude and are showing little interest in procurement. No transactions were reported yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e138">American Cotton Rebounds Due to Short Covering <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to pressure from sellers and factories dumping long-term contracts, but later rebounded due to short covering. Futures rose by 5 to 10 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 14 to 17 points, and spot prices fell by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 10 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly following American cotton, but later recovered slightly due to short covering. Pinglin'er fell by 6 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi fell by 7.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 2nd):</p>

<p>Price of Bo Dao (Thin Rice) in the Grain Market Increases by 2 Jiao</p>
<p>▲ Few boats arrived at various wharves in Shanghai South yesterday. Market sales were initially sluggish but later became active. Bai Geng (White Japonica) from Changshu, Xixi, Su Tong, etc., was firm, with prices for high-quality goods rising by 5 fen compared to the mid-range. Bo Dao (Thin Rice) was scarce, and retailers were quite shrewd, leading to a price increase of 2 jiao. Yang Jiao Jian (Foreign Pointed Rice) arrivals and sales were average, with prices remaining unchanged.</p>
<p>▲ River shipments in the North market yesterday had not yet become smooth, as the market in the west was quiet. Some inventory remained in urban and rural areas, making it difficult for the river market to recover. Although there were still many people visiting the market in the morning, most were inquiring about news. Due to the difficulty in improving sales channels, top-grade Bai Geng from Changshu and Xixi remained stable, with the mid-range slightly moving, up a few fen. Bo Zao Dao (Thin Early Rice) still showed no signs of improvement. Yang Jiao Jian (Foreign Pointed Rice) sales were not weak in this district, with prices remaining stable.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Slowing Rise in Foreign Rice Prices <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yangtze River Brokers Suspend Operations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market turned flat and soft again. This was because the newly arrived Xu Jia (许茄) ship was loaded with more than 70,000 bags of Xiaojiao (小絞, small milled rice), and there was also ample existing inventory. The continuous supply dampened market sentiment. Yesterday, there were also no inquiries from various Yangtze River routes, so the market trend saw a downward turn again. Subsequently, there were inquiries from inland village vendors, local merchants, and speculators, so market prices did not fall significantly. However, the upward trend seen in the past two or three days was hindered again. Aside from the 3,000 bags of Xiaojiao purchased by inland vendors, the rest was taken up by local and inland households. Sales included 4,200 bags of Xiaojiao at prices ranging from $10.35 to $9.90, 200 bags of Min Dang (敏黨) rice at $10.04, 1,500 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice at prices ranging from $11.52 to $11.57, and 1,000 bags of Qialadi (茄辣地) processed rice at $9.50. The futures market for Xiaojiao was firm as foreign firms did not dump inventory, and call-back cargo was priced at 5 taels and 8 fen. Jiangxi Ji Yuan (江西机元) rice was sold by local merchants at over 100 bags, priced from $13.30 to $13.00, with no significant difference from previous market prices.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Sluggish Flour Market and Falling Prices <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw mixed gains and losses, with significant discrepancies. However, millers' current flour bids remained high. For example, high-grade goods such as Bingchuan (兵船) and Lao Che (老车) brands were priced above 2 taels and 1 qian net, while mid-range goods also required 2 taels and 1 qian. Lower-grade brands were priced at 2 taels and 7-8 fen. On the market, call-back of May-delivery Bingchuan initially opened at 2 taels and 8 fen. Because merchants saw the good market shape of the previous day, there were also inquiries from northern and southern groups, so market prices gradually rose to 2 taels and 8 fen and 5 li. However, there were surprisingly few customers asking about it yesterday, and bulls were instead selling back. After prices rose significantly, sales volumes dropped even more, and the price gradually fell to 2 taels and 7 fen at closing. The market stabilized slightly and then recovered to 2 taels and 7 fen and 5 li.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Spring Silkworms in Yuhang Undergo Another Change</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Cold and Heat: Silkworms Discovered</p>
<p>In places like Pingyao and Jinjianong in Yuhang, this year's spring silkworms are mostly of foreign breeds, and the amount raised is only 40% of previous years. During the third sleep, there were several days of rain and cold weather, and diseases such as yellowing were discovered. Currently, the early silkworms have entered their major sleep. Unfortunately, in the past two days, although the weather has been sunny and warm, the weather has been hot and humid, and the silkworms have stopped feeding and are dormant, resembling silkworm plague. The spread is very rapid, and many have been discarded. This year's silkworm harvest is once again disappointing.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Qimen Tea Prices Soar <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The official weighing of new Qimen black tea has been underway for several days. Prices in the southwest region remain above 100 yuan, while prices in Fuliang are also hovering around 80 yuan. Qingpianye (青片叶) tea leaves are opening at 1.4 yuan per catty, with the cost of producing dry tea reaching approximately 320 yuan per dan (approximately 7 catties). Bai Hao (白毫, white down) tea is opening at 800 wen per liang, making the cost even greater than that of Qingpian (青片). Qimen tea prices have reached their peak. The initial intention of various firms was to lower mountain prices to reduce costs, but the situation has changed dramatically with the arrival of new tea. The quality of the mountain tea produced by mountain households is excellent, and firms have not reduced prices. They insist on raising mountain prices, and fellow merchants are eager to start business early and cannot wait. They have no choice but to open pricing according to the market. Prudent firms know that costs are too high and that they will face danger. However, due to the market trend, any hesitation will lead to lost opportunities, so they have no choice but to join the frenzy. In the past two days, the weather has suddenly turned cool, and tea buds have slowed down their growth. Mountain households are leisurely picking and drying, and shipments are not surging, making it difficult to expect prices to fall.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Fuliang Mao Feng Already Has New Produce <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Qing tea from Dongshang Township in Fuliang County is experiencing a slow budding process this year due to the frequent cold weather. Recently, the weather has cleared up and turned warm, making it the perfect time to pick the first flush of Mao Feng tea. Therefore, mountain households are selecting the slightly longer tea buds and picking and processing them early, resulting in tender leaves and a rich aroma. New Mao Feng from areas such as Siqian, Shiding, and Yaoli has already appeared on the market, with prices ranging from 6 jiao to 7.5 jiao per catty. However, shipments are limited, and only Jingdezhen merchants have purchased small quantities, with no large transactions completed.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Slight Increase in Coarse Sand and White Refined Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday's trading at the Sugar Market Association was active, and the trend was firm. The trading price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white was 12 taels, 8 qian, and 2.5 fen. Shipments from Xiamen were 12 taels and 7 qian, with the market shape still pretty. Taikoo Sugar B mark was called up to 16 taels and 3 qian, but few buyers accepted. DX mark was 15 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen, and HM mark was 13 taels and 7 qian, with slight transactions. The atmosphere was stable and graceful. Brokerage prices remained quiet. Taiyuan Ice Sugar recently continued to arrive, with brokers calling the original price of 9 taels and 8 qian. Due to sluggish sales, inquiries were very quiet.</p>
<p>Slight Rise in 9-Pound Coarse Cloth</p>
<p>▲ The trend of falling factory cloth has ceased, and actual sales are slightly more active. This is because the situation has progressed slightly, and there are rumors of the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway reopening, calming market sentiment. Yesterday, lightweight cloth turned to an increasingly firm trend, with 9-pound cloth rising by 2.5 fen. Jubaopen (聚寳盆), Sanji (三鷄), all at 4 taels, 1 qian and 7.5 fen. However, Maoying (猫英) 3 qian was willing to be sold off. Thirteen-pound cloth was slightly softer, with Jiutian (九天), Rendingqiu (人顶球), and Feixiong (飞熊) all at 5 taels and 5 qian. Sales of sixteen-pound cloth to the northern market were slightly active. Shuangyu (双鱼) Jiqing (吉庆) at 7 taels and 6 qian, Hongfu (鸿福) at 7 taels and 7 qian, Shuanglong (双龙) Sanxing (三星) at 7 taels and 8 qian. Due to the clandestine activity of Japanese factory goods recently, sales of fine cloth and fine twill have been quieter. Customer sales of dyed Yin Dan Qi Lin (阴丹七林) and Haichang Lan (海昌蓝), etc., have also been affected.</p>
<p>▲ The West Pi Tou (疋頭, piece goods) market is quiet, and all routes have depleted funds. In addition, there have been relatively many arrivals this year, so it is still difficult to turn the situation around. Yesterday, white-stripped Ma Sha (麻紗, linen yarn) Meizui (美最时) and Hekang (和康) brands had fallen to 2 qian and 7.5 fen. Zhuluomiao (珠羅秒) and Sheng Luo (生罗) and other products are typically in demand, but there is also no vitality. Yuan Yu Chou (元羽绸) and Taixi Duan (泰西缎) are not suited to the season, and there is even less opportunity. However, Piao Bu (漂布, bleached cloth) and Su Yang Miao (素洋秒) have slight, scattered sales.</p>
<p>Copper, Lead: Strong Momentum in the Tea Industry</p>
<p>As the new tea season approaches, the demand for copper and lead from the tea industry is increasing, making the market lively. In recent days, the market has seen a total of 1,500 dan of goods opened, and prices have increased by 1 qian due to the inconsistent supply of old and new goods on the market, selling for 13 taels and 9 qian per dan. However, market sentiment is very good, and there are also those who want 14 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen.</p>

<p>· Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e143">A Letter from Compound Gentleman <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, this publication has been greatly affected and had to be temporarily suspended. Although it has recently resumed, the contributors are very different. For example, in the literary and art section, since the publication of the excellent works of Mr. Chen Zhu, Zun Meng, and Shaochang, there have been very few submissions of new poetry, while there have been many submissions and responses of old poetry. I see that the readers welcome this, so I include the old poetry. Benevolent people see benevolence, and wise people see wisdom. Since readers each have their own preferences, the editor has no need to interfere.</p>
<p>However, there is one point that I would like to discuss with Gentleman Fang and all the readers: Is poetry better when it is old, or is it better when it is new? Is it better when it has rhyme and melody, or is it better when it is unrhymed and just sung casually? This question has been debated fiercely by many literary giants at home, but there is still no concrete solution. However, my opinion is that writing is definitely more convenient when it is new - but I cannot say that it is better. If we are talking about what is better, new poetry has its advantages, and old poetry also has its advantages. However, I believe that poetry is better when it is old because since it is literature and art, it should naturally have some artistic quality, and it is definitely not something that can be considered poetry if it is just sung casually.</p>
<p>If you say that classicism does not conform to modern trends, in fact, classicism - not only now - has never conformed to trends. The so-called poetry of Li Bai and Du Fu can be understood by old women. If this is classicism, then how can old women understand it? Even Tang Jingchuan of the Ming Dynasty and Yuan Zicai of the Qing Dynasty mostly advocated natural learning and used less classicism. However, due to the convenience of writing and the elegance of art, they occasionally used it, but this cannot be called classicism. If you say that we only care about the masses and do not care about art, then why should this publication have a literary and art section? In general, people often have places where they cannot act directly, and writing also has such a difficulty. Although I have not met you, (here I originally wanted to use the phrase "knowing Jing," but I was afraid that you would scold me for using classicism to force it in, so I dare not,) but judging from the wording of your letter and your actions, you must be a young man who has not yet undergone a baptism in social situations and academic aspects.</p>
<p>As for science, to be honest, our country is indeed the poorest and most immature in this field compared to other countries. At the moment, we are still in the era of selling scientific knowledge. However, since there is a lot of selling, there will naturally be creators emerging. Now, our country's bread problem is causing a big panic. It is not easy to build big projects, so this publication's position is to promote general small crafts and small sciences, hoping that all the items needed in life will be entirely made domestically. As for ships, railways, airplanes, bombs, etc., government officials will naturally think of ways to do this, and we can ignore them. It is only because of this war that the tragedies in places like Wusong and Zhabei were all caused by the enemy's cannons, airplanes, and bombs. Therefore, recently, this publication has often published such similar sciences, only because the people of our country have suffered this kind of pain and are still clueless. Therefore, we publish them so that everyone knows the structure of airplanes and how powerful bombs are. I believe that although the masses cannot manufacture this kind of timely science, it is not impossible for the masses to know something about it, and it cannot be said that it is too far from the masses and has absolutely no value for publication.</p>
<p>Looking back, I also have to say a word to several contributing scientists. In the future, if you give us manuscripts, please do not send manuscripts of the type "What is water? What is aroma?" Please send what the raw materials of that thing are, whether it is made of salt or rosin or protein, and what kind of procedures and methods are used to make that thing. If you send such manuscripts, this publication will be even more welcome because it is quite in line with this publication's purpose of promoting small crafts.</p>
<p>Alas, editing this publication is really difficult. The first thing is that the space is narrow and cannot be fully published. The second thing is to match the tastes of the readers. As the saying goes, "The father-in-law wants wontons, and the mother-in-law wants noodles." Matching the tastes of the father-in-law does not match the tastes of the mother-in-law. How can we make the tastes of the newspaper-reading gentlemen in society mostly correct? I thought of an old story in foreign textbooks about a father and son both leading a donkey, which resulted in the donkey dying in the river. It can be seen that nothing in the world can please everyone. However, I will do my best to make my heart at peace.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to inform the comrades who contribute manuscripts that the manuscripts should be as short as possible, and at most should not exceed 500 characters. If they are not used, they will not be returned. Because there are dozens of manuscripts submitted every day, the procedures are quite troublesome, and there are other difficulties. I will explain them later.</p>

<p>— Liu Qi</p>
<p>Although people who fly on airplanes now feel that traveling is fast, they are always apprehensive about the possibility of an airplane accident. If they fall to the ground, their lives will be in danger. Therefore, it is not easy for aviation to develop. This security issue is also very important. According to Reuters, a French engineer named Albert Sauvant has invented a safety steel box installed in airplanes to avoid danger. He conducted a field test on the 26th of last month, intentionally crashing his airplane into the cliff rocks beside the mountain at a height of 500 feet. The airplane spun six somersaults and crashed into pieces on the ground. At that time, Albert climbed out of the airplane and showed the frightened audience that the safety steel box in the airplane was not damaged at all.</p>
<p>This time, his test was not approved by the French authorities and was done privately. Now, he is requesting permission to test it again at a height of 3,000 feet. He has previously used model airplanes to test drops several times. The airplanes carried small lamb heads and some eggs. Because of the protection of the safety steel box, they were not damaged when they fell. In the future, if all airplanes are equipped with this kind of safety steel box, then air travel will not only be fast but also safe.</p>

<p>One afternoon, Mr. C met his friend Mr. Z on the road.</p>
<p>"Old Z, how have you been these days? Do you feel depressed?"</p>
<p>"Depressed! How can I not be depressed? I can't think of anything!"</p>
<p>" ... Want to stroll around the playground? What about the cinema? Dance hall? ... "</p>
<p>"No! I haven't been to any of them! What time is it now? A national crisis is upon us! How can I have the heart to have fun!" Mr. Z said sternly to Mr. C, expressing his extreme concern for the country.</p>
<p>"Ha! People's hearts are already dead! Chinese people are not willing to fight for respect! 'Five minutes of heat'! It has long been laughed at by others! What 'national crisis' or not, Chinese people are only fit to be 'slaves'! Haha! Old Z, what does it matter to have fun?"</p>
<p>Three days later, at the entrance of an XXX cinema, Mr. C saw his friend Mr. Z again ... The movie had just ended.</p>
<p>"Yo! Old Z, where are you going?"</p>
<p>" ... " Mr. Z was stunned, a little ashamed on his face!</p>
<p>"You were ... " Mr. C was very surprised.</p>
<p>"Watching a movie!" Mr. Z tried to pretend to be casual ... "Today's movie is very good!"</p>
<p>"Huh? Didn't you once say ... "</p>
<p>"Yes! During a national crisis! We shouldn't be having fun! But, look at the scene in Shanghai, does it still look like 'a national crisis period'? The 'five minutes of heat' has already passed! The image in my mind has gradually faded! Naturally, why should I try to fight for respect alone? Even if I do, it's useless, ha, ha, it's better for everyone to go for a stroll! Relax!"</p>
<p>"Hahaha! ... "</p>
<p>"Mr. C, let's go to XXX Western Restaurant together! Then we can go to the dance hall! I'll treat! ... "</p>

<h3 id="e148">Proposing Marriage or Compiling Photos? <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Huan</p>
<p>"A son of a certain aristocratic family, a graduate of high school, is currently employed in a certain institution and earns a considerable monthly income. Now, with the consent of his parents, he is widely seeking marriage. He hereby publishes in the newspapers to solicit lovers. Any willing lady, please attach a recent photo and a detailed resume and send it to Box No. X of this newspaper."</p>
<p>The above advertisement was published in a certain newspaper half a month ago. This was not a big deal, but it caught the attention of a certain lady who rarely reads newspapers.</p>
<p>She is currently working as an elementary school teacher, and she feels that her youth is about to fade away, so she is very anxious to find her partner. Usually, because her conditions are too harsh, it has been delayed year after year, and there is still no suitable person. Now, seeing such an advertisement, how can she not think that "the opportunity will not come again"? Therefore, she secretly sent her photo and resume, and also attached a few affectionate and eager words.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the third day, she received a letter with a postage stamp attached, typed on a government machine. The letter said:</p>
<p>"Upon receiving your fragrant letter, I was overjoyed. However, I am mainly concerned about health in this marriage solicitation. Your graceful appearance is very much in line with my conditions, but the facial expression is not enough to represent the health of the whole body. Therefore, I am writing to you to respectfully request that you send me special poses of your chest, abdomen, legs, etc. within a week (please sign formally after the photos to prevent counterfeiting), so that we can grow old together and have no regrets forever. I think you will also express sympathy (the rest is omitted)."</p>
<p>Health? That is in line with my tastes. I remember that she also participated in the city sports meet last year. Although she was not as good as XXX, she also surpassed many female athletes. Now he really wants a "healthy and beautiful" woman. Perhaps she still has a hope of being selected. She was very pleased and unhesitatingly took many photos like the ones at the swimming pool, placed them in a brocade box, and sent them solemnly.</p>
<p>She thought about it all day long, she thought about it all day long, the more she thought about it, the more she fantasized. She said with confidence that this matter would definitely succeed, and she would definitely not be rejected. Moreover, she also fantasized about the other person's physique. Perhaps he was also an athlete. Then, in the gym and swimming pool, it would be even more fun. She was so lost in thought that she almost went crazy.</p>
<p>Ah! Did Hong Qiao make a mistake? Why is it almost a week and she has not received his reply? She couldn't wait, so she wrote letters to ask. However, no matter how many letters she sent out, there were still no replies from the other side. She was annoyed, so she wrote to question him again. Sure enough, it came:</p>
<p>"Your instructions and photos have arrived. I have now obtained the consent of Ms. X and will be engaged immediately. I am sorry for your kind intentions and cannot help but apologize."</p>
<p>She was so angry that she couldn't speak after reading this short note.</p>
<p>"Proposing marriage or compiling photos?"</p>
<p>Became her last question;</p>

<h3 id="e149">Debates Among Female Students <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— ·蓓蕾·</p>
<p>The spring rain was gently pattering against the window, the air pressure felt heavy and dull. In the dormitory of XX Girls' School, the lights were already out. Most of the girls were seeking sweet dreams in their warm beds. However, the spring rainy night filled the hearts of the girls with emptiness and unease. Bored, they started a casual conversation again.</p>
<p>Female students, especially those in high school, often while away the long nights with aimless chatter. Yet, within this aimless chatter, there often exists a mysterious undercurrent.</p>
<p>In this dormitory, close to the school gardens, even with the rain, the fragrance of flowers faintly wafted through the air. Miss Qian's bed was next to the window. The fine rain falling on the leaves prevented her from falling asleep. So, she spoke first, calling to Xuan on the opposite bed:</p>
<p>"Hey, are you asleep yet? Tell us again about your experience escaping during the invasion and seeing people being abducted by enemy soldiers." Xuan, who was at this moment still haunted by the painful history of her escape, was not yet asleep. She replied to Miss Qian with a tone of shame and anger, "Such humiliating acts are difficult to describe. In short, we defenseless women are powerless to resist."</p>
<p>"Well, how did you manage to escape then?"</p>
<p>"Don't mention it, it's too embarrassing."</p>
<p>Ping and Ying, meanwhile, were quietly discussing whose lover was this way and whose fiancé was that way... The four people in the room had formed two pairs, each engaged in their own conversation.</p>
<p>Hearing Ying happily engaging in the same corrupt discussions as before, Xuan recalled how passionately Ying had given speeches everywhere before the Battle of Shanghai began. She couldn't help but taste her own ordeal and the contradiction it revealed. So, she called out to Ying, saying in a scolding tone, "Did the spirit of bravery dissipate with the sound of gunfire? Didn't you used to say that heroes who kill enemies could even demand kisses? Now that heroes have indeed emerged, are kisses being realized in practice? How can you be so passive after losing our territory!"</p>
<p>Ying, who was usually known for her debating skills, could not accept such words. She immediately retorted, "Am I passive? Am I afraid? People who aren't afraid wouldn't be in such a mess when they see enemy soldiers. What's all this talk about passive and active?"</p>
<p>These words seemed to pour fuel on Xuan's fire, who said, "We couldn't fight the enemy because we didn't have guns. I know that there are no sacrifices that are not in vain, and those who have value. At least, I personally experienced national calamity, which is better than you who only know how to talk empty words."</p>
<p>"I only know how to talk empty words? Yes, I wonder if those who speak the truth have ever realized anything?"</p>
<p>"That's just quibbling, it doesn't make any logical sense."</p>
<p>The two sides argued until they reached a boiling point. Ping and Miss Qian remained neutral, neither speaking nor mediating. Miss Qian was friendlier with Xuan, while Ping leaned toward Ying.</p>
<p>Just as the argument was getting heated, there were three gentle taps on the glass window. "No talking after lights out!" It was clearly the voice of the dormitory supervisor.</p>
<p>Thus, a debate that was unconsciously conscious came to an end. Only the gentle rain continued to patter against the flower branches.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>"The Tearful History of Youlan," which premiered yesterday at the Nanjing Grand Theatre, is an unprecedentedly tragic and beautiful epic film. The protagonist, Elizabeth Landi, whose expressions in "Spiritual and Carnal Love" and "Yellow Permit" were well-appreciated by audiences, needs no further introduction. In this film, she plays a young woman whose husband falls in love with another. She laments her ill fate, but to protect her husband, she spares no effort to save him, even at the cost of throwing herself into danger and ending up in prison. Her due date arrives, and her newborn child is taken away. The separation of mother and child is extremely heartbreaking. Although she exhausts every possible means to retrieve her child, she is imprisoned again for kidnapping. Elizabeth Landi's performance is even more profound than in her previous films. Every movement and expression deeply moves the audience. The supporting actor, Mike Lauren, gives an outstanding performance. The rest of the cast also put in extraordinary effort, making this film a worthwhile watch.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Ford Small Car　Yu· <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>▲ Made in England</p>
<p>In the British automobile industry, a type of small car has recently become popular, known as the "baby" car. This type of small car is not only smaller in appearance than ordinary cars, but its engine horsepower is also reduced accordingly. In Britain, automobile taxes are calculated annually based on the horsepower of the car. Therefore, in recent years, most car drivers have been moving from large to small cars for economic reasons. Moreover, "baby" cars are not only cheaper to tax, but all driving expenses are also related to the smaller engine and reduced horsepower, which reduces the burden on car owners. In addition, there is another reason for purchasing a car, which is that its selling price is lower than that of ordinary cars. For this reason, small cars in Britain are very popular, and all automobile manufacturers are working hard to develop small cars. As a result, the display of "baby" cars occupies a large part of the automobile exhibitions held in England.</p>
<p>Ford cars have always had an advantage in sales in England. Ford has a branch in England, and its products are numerous, competing with British goods for a share of the market. Recently, in order to develop its business and keep up with the trend, Ford has created a small Ford car in England. According to news from London, this small car has eight horsepower, is beautifully styled, and is economical to use. It can compete with the current popular good small cars. It is expected that when this car is launched, there will be another boom in the British automobile industry.</p>
<p>The first model of the "baby" Ford car was manufactured in the United States and was completely designed and assembled manually. When it crossed the Atlantic Ocean to England, it was kept absolutely secret. This car was displayed at the Albert Hall in London on February 19, beginning its first meeting with the British people.</p>
<p>The new car's engine has four cylinders, with a size of 2.23 inches by 6.64 inches. It can generate 7.96 horsepower. According to this horsepower, the annual tax is 8 pounds. The cylinder head can be separated and is of integral construction. The lower half is cast together with the crankshaft box. The valves are made of high-quality alloy steel. Other engine components are also carefully refined. The car's wheelbase is seven feet six inches, and the track is three feet eight inches.</p>
<p>Regarding the price of this Ford small car, the cost calculation cannot be hastily calculated in the short term. Therefore, on the morning when the new car was displayed for public viewing, the selling price of the car could not yet be announced. The final official selling price will be announced later. A two-door sedan will be sold for 120 British pounds. In addition, a four-door sedan will also be launched soon.</p>
<p>The Ford small car is extremely well-made, and the spaciousness of the car body is also one of its characteristics. The rear seat position of this car is very comfortable, especially the rear compartment. Sitting in it, the legs feel very comfortable, without the discomfort of shifting and fidgeting. The headroom is even more spacious. Even a six-foot-tall person can sit upright with a hat on, without feeling uncomfortable at all. Therefore, getting in and out of the car is quick and easy, and the driver feels comfortable on both sides. Other equipment is naturally simplified due to the low and small body. However, there is still a fuel gauge. The position of the gear lever is quite appropriate. The position of the handbrake is a bit far, but in practice, it is only used for parking.</p>
<p>The car's generator is installed between the engine and the frame, in a very low position, which is not easy to touch. However, the location of the coil plug and distributor is convenient. Therefore, the appearance is also good. All of the above are the general details of this new small car. Ford's launch of a small car is a major change in its car-making history. The style of the small car is an English style, so its significance is even more important. The first car Ford made was the Model A with 24 horsepower. The second was a smaller one with 14.9 horsepower. Since then, there have been many changes, striving to meet the requirements of the times. Recently, the launch of small cars is due to economic reasons. However, Ford is still working hard to produce large cars. As for the future sales of this 8-horsepower small car, it is difficult to say for sure at this time. However, judging from its exquisite workmanship, low selling price, and the needs of the public, it should not be difficult to sell well and become popular.</p>
<h3 id="e155">A Stunning Achievement: The MG Midget · <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Aston has already gained a fine reputation. On February 16th of last year, Mr. Aston drove a British car with an engine of less than 750cc and achieved a speed of 103.13 miles per hour over a five-kilometer course. Later, he drove ten miles and maintained a speed of over 100 miles per hour, achieving an average speed of 101.86 miles per hour, breaking the previous record. It is worth noting that Mr. Aston is the first person to achieve a speed of over 100 miles per hour with an engine of less than 750cc. The car he drove was an MG Midget. Those engaged in the construction of so-called small cars have long hoped that their products would achieve such results. However, only MG cars have succeeded in this endeavor. Although future advancements in automobiles are unlimited, MG's achievement is already commendable and worthy of praise. On October 17th of last year, Mr. Eyston again drove a 750cc MG car and achieved a speed of 110.28 miles per hour over a five-kilometer course. This is equivalent to the speed of Mr. Campbell in the Blue Bird II.</p>
<p>The history of the MG Car Company is particularly interesting. With personal enthusiasm and perseverance, coupled with the support and sympathy of the general manager, the company has made rapid progress and achieved its current position. Just seven years ago, there was no such thing as an MG car. But it immediately made a name for itself, becoming exceptionally active and making significant progress. The following is a brief account of its success story, which the readers may find interesting.</p>
<p>Initially, Mr. Morris (now known as Sir William Morris) not only had a large and thriving manufacturing plant in Cowley but also owned several car dealerships in Oxford, managed by Mr. Cecil Kimber. Mr. Kimber was skilled in manufacturing motorcycles, striving for perfection and speed. When he had the opportunity to manage car manufacturing, he applied his spirit of striving for excellence in motorcycles to cars. He strongly urged his superiors to devote his full efforts to improving the then-popular bullnose Morris Oxford car, to make it faster than other Morris cars. Although only six of these handcrafted cars were produced in the first year, the success of all subsequent great plans and the transformation of the Morris bullnose radiator into today's long style are based on this. As a result of Mr. Kimber's efforts, the new MG car was a success, unique and distinctive, with its own unapproachable characteristics.</p>
<p>Since then, improvements have been made step by step. Two years ago, through fortuitous circumstances, he acquired a state-of-the-art manufacturing plant, and a new company was formed, still managed by Mr. Kimber. Sir William remained a strong supporter. The new company was larger in scale and better equipped, and various new cars were launched one after another. In total, the factory produced three types of MG cars: the 17.7 horsepower six-cylinder MG, the 8 horsepower MG, and the MG Midget. In summary, the design and construction of MG cars are all based on "speed above all else" and "safe and fast" as their goals. It is no wonder that their performance is excellent and they are enthusiastically welcomed by the world.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Standard Nine Car Victory · <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The automobile test held on March 4th of this year was initiated by Colonel Phillips and directed by the Royal Automobile Club. A total of 341 vehicles participated in the test, including powerful large cars and exquisite small cars. As a result of the test, the Standard Nine car driven by Mr. Stirling, ranked third, was one of the best performing and most effective vehicles in the preliminary round. It is true that there were many cars participating in the test that had good performance, but among them, only the Standard Nine Saloon driven by Mr. Oliver and the Standard Nine Saloon driven by Mr. Stirling, which won the third prize, stood out. This is truly an outstanding small vehicle in the modern automotive world.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Records</p>
<h3 id="e160">Overview of the Dunlop Rubber Company · Yun · <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Consider that most businesses, regardless of their industry, start small and simple, but through hard work, they eventually grow and their activities spread throughout the world. There are many such businesses, but among them, the Dunlop Rubber Company stands out as the one that has made the most rapid progress and achieved the most amazing results. Since Dr. J. B. Dunlop invented the pneumatic tire in 1888, more than forty years have passed. During this period, the company has worked hard to advance its business and has always been consistent, never slacking off. Therefore, its results have become better and its business has become more prosperous. Today, the company's factories are located on five continents, and its products are popular all over the world.</p>
<p>Given the Dunlop Company's grand scale and extensive activities, it is not easy to understand its details. However, a look at the following major aspects should give you a good idea of its situation.</p>
<p>Dunlop Company currently has 200,000 spindles, working day and night, to weave its famous combed textiles for the manufacture of tires.</p>
<p>Each year, Dunlop Company uses 40,000 tons of rubber. In the tropical regions, it has 100,000 acres of rubber plantations, and employs no less than 15,000 workers just to do this kind of work.</p>
<p>The total number of Dunlop distributors around the world reaches 60,000 households, all dedicated to selling Dunlop tires and serving their customers.</p>
<p>In total, there are approximately 30 million Dunlop tires of various types in use on roads around the world. Even more remarkably, every two and a quarter seconds, someone somewhere in the world buys a Dunlop tire.</p>
<p>Dunlop Rubber Company is a manufacturer of various types of tires, ranging from large tires used by large bomber aircraft and commercial aircraft to small tires used by children's prams. Dunlop Company can be proud to say that whenever movement depends on rubber, there is a Dunlop tire to suit the purpose.</p>
<p>Dunlop Rubber Company pioneered the pneumatic automobile tire, so it was also the first to introduce the pneumatic rickshaw tire to China. Old-fashioned solid tires are now almost extinct in China.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Segrave drove his 1,000 horsepower Sunbeam racing car to a record speed of 203.8 miles per hour at Daytona Beach on March 29, 1927. The tires used on the car were specially made by the Dunlop Company at the request of Sir Segrave. Sir Malcolm Campbell achieved a record of 260 miles per hour in 1931, also using Dunlop tires.</p>
<p>In addition to tires, Dunlop Company is also a manufacturer of the famous Dunlop tennis balls and golf balls. At every competition in the United Kingdom, the winners use them happily. The balls used in the recent Chinese Open Golf Championship were also Dunlop products. In 1931, 23 countries selected Dunlop balls for their national championship competitions. Among the 22 countries participating in the Davis Cup competition, 19 countries, including the final, selected Dunlop balls. [I&gt;Driving a 1932 Citroen sports car for a country outing is a lot of fun</p>
