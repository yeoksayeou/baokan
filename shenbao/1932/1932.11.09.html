<h3 id="c2">對日經濟戰新陣線之整備誠 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>自去年九一八事變突發。在中日兩民族間激起可怖之波瀾而後。種種不同其性質之戰爭。遂在兩國賡續展闌丨丨在外交上。圖際聯盟大會中之機橫椑闔。至爲顯明。在軍事上。一二八滬戰與延續迄今且日益擴大之東北義。勇軍與日本軍隊之爭鬥。亦爲世所共見。而在經濟上。自九一八以後。我國之抵貨運動與最近日本之傾銷政策。正亦針鋒相對</p>
<p>自各種戰爭廣績展開而後。在我國方面。尙未能調整步武。作一致之奮鬥以言外交。則常處於被動之地位。以方軍事。一二八滬戰。雖支持達月餘之久。但終以後援不繼而退却。惟東产各地之義勇軍。以其卓絶之精神與優越之戰略。與日軍持久奮鬥。使日人在東北之統治。無法鞏固建立。乃爲日人所最感困難最所畏忌者。日外交時報主筆半澤玉城在「如何應處理滿洲」一秘文中曾謂「······所以維持治安格困難。倘派遣滿洲國軍（？）去討伐。那便來得正好。反被他們（指義軍）利用去了。這眞是一件可恨的滑稽事。若派遣我忠誡之將士去征伐誠爲可惜且有相當的犧牲。日本的將士。倘與强盛的敵國作戰。當然有决勝的勇氣和訓練。但與這些不是正正堂堂的便衣隊和馬賊（？）作戰。實非所長。好比在海洋成大河内游泳。確是極高妙的選手。但在泥田中游泳。便困難了。」在其誇張之陰面。實已切實透露出其畏懼我義軍之眞情。抑且在滬戰中日軍戰鬥力之薄弱。已爲我十九路軍所澈底揭露。故在軍事之爭鬥。上我國實尙未遭受若何顯著之换敗。</p>
<p>目前最堪憂慮最爲危殆者。厥爲經濟戰。在九一八禍變發生不久之後。我國對日經濟戰之步伍。誠頗調整。在激昂之民氣下。日本經濟所遭受之打擊。至爲嚴重。此種戰略。在我國誠最爲制敵之上策。堅壁清野。持久作戰。假如能支持若干年。則日本之整個陣線。必立呈凌亂之勢而全局崩潰但以我方一鼓作氣。再襄三竭陣勢失亂。戰爭之壘堡。全部爲其所衙破。至於目前。乃反陷於全局破落。顯呈險象。</p>
<p>自九月份以來。日貨之進口者乃逐漸增多。從前冷寂之市場。復呈活氣。近月來日本更厲行傾銷政策。日貨遂潮湧而來。復橫行於我市塲。即以煤炭一宗而言。自六月份以來。即開始傾銷。撫順之煤。如在瀋陽與大連出售。可獲厚利而日商竟棄重利不顧以每噸六兩餘甚至五兩之低價。向上海及漢口傾銷。每噸且須蝕本兩餘。在最近更有每噸低至三兩餘者。以此與我資金薄弱而運費捐稅極高之國煤相競爭。自如搖枯拉朽。煤之市塲。遂　爲其所龔斷。據海關統計。八月份上海進口日煤爲二萬九千七百九十七噸。九月份爲四萬三千一百四十四噸。比八月份電激增百分之四十五。此種積極採取攻勢之傾銷政策。實至毒辣。煤炭如是。其他如紗布紙絲水泥等貨。亦無不如是。於是我對日經濟戰之陣線。至此乃全部瓦解不僅目肖處於失敗之地位而我民族工業因遭受此種有力之打擊。基礎亦因而機本動搖其可危可慮莫甚於此。</p>
<p>以故。吾人認爲我國目前經濟戰之陣線。亟應重新整備。第一。全民族應充分發揮愛護民族精神。以提倡國貨。防禦其傾銷政策。并持之以恒。執之以堅第二。我政府於民族工業應加意提倡愛護。尤應誠輕稅率。以减輕國產貨品之成本。第三。在交通上應充分子以便利。減輕其運費第四。國產工業應勿作自我之競爭。而集中全力以一致對外。第五。命融家應著目於整個民族之利益。多投資於工業。以培植民族工業之基礎。第六。海關應提高稅率。以防止外貨之傾銷。假如我人能於上列六項。一一實行。則對日之經濟戰。不難轉敗爲勝即中日爭持之全局。亦可因此而顯呈轉捩。</p>
<p>目前日本之經濟。本已百孔千瘡。而尤以農村之凋敝。爲其致命之打擊。軍備之形式雖强而經濟之實際則弱。此一弱點。吾人如能善爲乘隙搗虚。則即可獲最後勝利。希臘言詩人荷馬在其叙事詩中。曾記述一希臘小孩愛乞力士之神話。謂愛乞力士幼時多病。神靈曾浸彼於河内使成爲銅皮鐵骨。但其足跟。因當時神靈緊握之故。未嘗着水。遂爲全身之唯一弱點。其後愛乞力士戰死。致命即在此處。今日本軍備之形式强矣。但其經濟之弱點。固亦無異於愛乞力士之足跟。吾人其看準此足跟。運用我民族自衛之唯一經濟武器。作最後有力之一擊。</p>

<p>全國四千萬選民參加投票</p>
<p>下屆元首誰屬今晚可分曉</p>
<p>民心背離胡佛難與羅斯福爭勝</p>
<p>國民社七日華盛頓電　　明日爲美國改選總統初選之期、今夜最後播音、將勸全國四千萬選民明日不問晴雨、齊赴選舉事務所投票、美國氣象局亦照例發氣象預報、通知選舉辦事員及選民何處可望晴朗、何處將雨須預備雨具、全國各地選舉事務所將於明晨六時開始投票、有數州在晚間六時即行截止、其餘則至夜間九時截止、照例雖截止時間、而業在事務所内之選民仍可照常投票、必俟人人投畢而後封匭、故有時封匭時間或竟須展延至一小時以後、惟有若干州法律亦規定苟選舉册上選民悉行投禁後、雖未屆截止投票時間、亦可封匭檢票、至檢票時間有數區在一小時内即可竣事、據熟於選舉事務者聲稱、倘選與趨勢一如預測、傾向於一方、則下屆總統之誰屬、在星期三上午一時（上海時間星期三下午二時）即可分曉、否則須再遲一二小時方能確知云</p>
<p>世界社云、美國大選已於昨日開始、其最後結果、關係國際政局至鉅、茲譯密勒評論報關於美國各政黨對此次選舉之論文如左、以資參考、</p>
<p>十一月八日美國男女人民之達選舉年齡者、將皆投票以選舉今後四年間管理美國政治之元首、雖選舉競爭之中心、在於共和民主兩黨之間、然實際參加競爭者、共有力個政黨、其總統候選人則有十人、至於九黨而有候選人十名者、因小黨之一所謂「自由黨」者、近曾分裂而爲兩派故也、茲列各黨與候選人名如下、</p>
<p>黨名　　　總統候選員　副總統候選員</p>
<p>共和黨　　胡佛　　寇蒂斯</p>
<p>民主黨　　羅斯福　嘉納</p>
<p>社會黨　　湯木斯　毛勒爾</p>
<p>共產（工人）黨　福斯德　福特（黑種人）</p>
<p>社會勞動黨　雷瑙慈　　愛根</p>
<p>禁酒黨　　曷潑囂　　呂干</p>
<p>農工黨　　科克賽　　（無候選人）</p>
<p>自由黨　　韋白哈佛　　海門韋</p>
<p>失業黨　　科克司　　鐵司丹兒</p>
<p>美國政府雖被目爲保守主義的及資本主義的、而多數美國人民亦有此種傾向、然此非美國人民無自由投票之權之謂、如上所記、美國政黨旣有九個、美民儘可依其自已之政見而選與總統、即使選舉共產黨員、福斯德及福特二氏爲今後四年間之美國正副元首、亦無不可、在實際上、下屆總統將不外乎胡佛氏或羅斯福氏、但因目下美國内之嚴重的經濟不振情形、社會黨此次所得票數、或將遠多於其過去之歷史、該黨候選人湯木斯近曾預料此次該黨選舉力可增四倍、其故即在經濟不振及兩大黨之顯然無改善情形之力也、美國政象之混亂及不安、殆從未有甚於此時者、其厚因至多、非短詞所能盡、要之、在尋常經濟的及政治的爭端之外、又有禁酒問題、共和民主兩黨鑒於試圖禁酒之顯無效果、均有修正禁酒律之表示、而民主黨似較共和黨更爲「濕」些、又有須知者、共和黨在此次選舉中、其内部大形分裂、該黨内之自由或進步分子已轉而投入民主黨灞其特著者爲加州籍之强生參議員、彼已背棄胡佛、將挈彼之一州歸於民主黨旗下、又韋斯康新州之拉福勒脫一派、伊沃華州籍之白洛克哈參議員、尼白拉斯加州之瑙利司參議員、均已背棄胡佛、惟伊達賀州籍之波拉參議員、雖不滿意於胡佛之政策、近曾宣言願爲共和黨投票、至於美國之產業界諸領袖、一向立於共和黨側、而於今年之選舉、則亦不一致、有若干要人已轉入民主黨矣、惟汽車王福特素爲民主黨人、此次則宣稱願擁護共和黨之胡佛、在平時共和黨投禁人數、恒較民主黨从六七百萬、而今年因經濟不振、有數百萬人失業、又有千萬人連農民在内喪失金錢、僉以此次責任、廳由胡佛總統及共和黨負之、故共和黨所得票數將大减少、至於居住海外之美國公民、美國法律無允許彼等投票之規定、故僑寓遠東之數千萬人、對於此次選舉、無可表示其取捨、然彼等雖無投票欋、未嘗不深感興味、尤以注意美國之對外政策者爲然云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯七日倫敦電　英國輿論對美國總統選舉、極端注意、一般民衆眼中所見者、不過禁酒派與反禁酒派之爭、而在識見高明者、則因總統選舉、而慮及三種重大問題、㈠戰債問題、此事現應由美國發動、方能討論、㈡軍縮問題、關於此層、如僅係陸地軍備、則任何計畫、英國均無異議、若涉及海軍、則英國態度比較不易應付、㈢關稅問題、美國稅則爲英國保護政策之出發點、若干人士頗以英政府厲行何護制爲憂、如美國能參加世界經濟會議、並贊成减輕保護政策、而低减關稅、則英國之主張保護政策者、成亦可以和　、甚至有人謂、美國如能如此、則全世界關稅壁壘、或可由此低減云、</p>
<p>路透社七日紐約電　總統選舉賭賽現仍未止、購民主黨票者、以五博一、或以六博一、預料在明日投票開始以前、賭金差額將增至七對一、</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>哈瓦斯八日紐約電　美國選舉人經劇烈之選舉競爭以後、乃於今日選舉新大總統、此次選舉殆以經濟衰敗爲最大關　蓋失業工人一千一百萬人、在選舉人總數四千七百萬之中、約計四分之一、對於選舉結果當有重大影響、故據多數政治觀察家之推測、胡佛總統之命運、將取决於中東部五州之投票、此五州即密蘇里·米立尼阿·俄亥俄·印地安那·伊亞華是、以上各州之農工業感受經濟恐愈、足使共和黨遭遇從來未有之厄運、總統選舉雖非由選舉人直接投票、乃由選舉人選舉代表而任其選舉總統、但明日投票結果、可知新總統之誰屬、蓋此項選舉代表、乃按照選舉人所指定之候選人而投票也、在大總統及副總統之選舉中、各州所選代表人數、係爲各該州在參衆兩院代表名額相等、依此計算、全國各州共有代表五百三十一人、以過半數而論、至少當有二百六十六票、方能選出元首、</p>
<p>路透八日紐約電　美國今日選舉總統結果如何、全國民衆極爲注意、將全夜不眠以待消息、跳舞塲等處平時夜間三時必停業、今夜則特别通融、展至午前五時以便市人游憩其中、</p>

<p>國民社八日舊金山電　美國總統選舉即於今晨開始、共和黨胡佛總統昨在鹽湖城作末次演說後、遄返故里、乃昨日深夜復有圖炸專車將過之橋樑陰謀、幸及時發覺、總統專車得免於危、此次專車所過、鑒於日前之兩次陰謀、由鐵路公司會同州警察與國家保安隊沿途嚴密警戒、每位橋樑及鐵路彎曲及其他易施破壞之處、皆派保安隊防護、乃尼伐達州荒寞之處、復有人置炸藥於橋心鐵路下、迨總統專車自愛國科牧廠出發後、奸徒即往暗置藥綫、當爲守橋者瞥見、上前查詢、乃竟開槍拒捕、守兵遂還槍小戰片刻、奸徒始遺二十餘藥綫而遁、守兵不暇追緝、急設法移去橋下炸彈、但事後查勘、沿途血跡淋漓、料奸徒殆必受傷、諒經全國大索之後、當不難緝獲也、聞此事尙未啓報胡佛云、</p>

<p>路透七日柏林電　巴本政府今日聲稱、對於選舉結果認爲滿意、政府未有改變其現行政策之理由、任何黨派有願與政府合作者、政府準備歡迎之云、新國會將於十二月十二日召集開會、各政黨將於開會以前從事談判、今後數星期將甚寗靜、因現已宣佈政治休戰、所有政治會議及示威行動、皆所不許也、急進派罷工委員會今日已宣佈停止運輸罷工、預料全部運輸事業、明日可恢復、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯七日柏林電　巴本内閣對於此次選舉結果、甚爲滿意、蓋選民投票百分率之减少、以及國社黨所得票數之顯然减少、皆爲巴本所未及料者也、但有數點頗使巴本不能安心、第一希特勒宣言、絶不能與巴本妥恊、甚或謂希氏將以武力對待者、僅爲個人問題　若排除巴本、而組織各黨廣汎之聯合内閣、則希黨亦未始不願參加、且不獨向來主張此事之中央黨贊成眦種聯合、即國權黨亦未始無參加之可能、而國權黨固右派内閣在議會組成多數黨時所萬不能少者、最近右派各報社論、主張各黨集中、現在有人謂此種集中、將由國防部長實現之、經濟界人士受國社黨極端主義與共產潮流之恐嚇、對各黨之集中、亦必加以鼓吹也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯七日柏林電　國社黨首領希特勒近又向其黨員發表宣言、謂「德國政府對於人民權　之攻擊、及其所施之暴力、現在已被阻止、巴本政府已完全失敗、巴本之黨徒即國權黨及其友黨、在議會中僅有十分之一之勢力、吾人必繼續反抗此種勢力、使其消滅而後已、對於此竽份子、吾人絶無與之國和妥恊之可能」云、最後希氏謂、將以較前尤爲盛大之宣傳、攻擊此項勢力云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯七日柏林電　星期日選舉中、國社黨有李滋們將軍當選、在衆議員中年齡最大、較共產黨柴慶夫人尤長七歲、故新衆院開幕時、即將以渠爲臨時主席云、</p>

<p>塔斯社七日莫斯科電　今日軍事革命委員會發出一由伏羅希洛夫署名之宣言、宣稱、蘇聯之軍隊將努力於社會主義之建設、而决不欲戰爭、據云「十五年來吾等無時不在求和平、吾等知紅軍愈强大、敵人愈不敢寇蘇聯之邊境、吾等之和平政策亦愈穏固、」最後謂紅軍將始終保持其維持和平之政策、不使任何侵略者踏入其邊境云、</p>

<p>人體電力攝影術之新發明</p>
<p>含電人參膠「無量壽」之價値</p>
<p>意大利國學士院會員麻利那次博士爲現著名科學者，世以未來派之始祖推尊，最近麻氏在意國學士院科學部會議席上，報告一生物學上重大發明，即麻氏與克禮毛那西博士能攝影由人體放射之生命力（電力）是也，據麻氏學說，謂此種偉大新發明之結果，不久或可求人類活力之公則，將得生物學中生理的數學之要素，亦未可知云，按此實騐報告，與上海佛慈藥廠發明創製「無量壽」新藥之人體補充電氣之學下，完全相同，人體旣常放射電力，則須同時常補充電氣於體内，應用含電人參膠「無量壽」，使人内服，則確能補充電氣於體内，以增進健康，預防疾病，誠爲中西古今破天荒之電氣劑補品也，</p>
<p>試以顯微鏡檢查老年人身體，則多數細胞均形成萎縮狀態，或膨脹而成顆粒戕，角質狀，玻璃樣等變化，終於成爲空胞，遂消失細胞核，而以之死滅，蓋人體細胞，固有生活機能之原動力，乃電氣作用發生之現象，而致衰老病死之眞正原因，卽體内發生之電氣量漸次减退而已，然則身體内發生之電氣量，因何漸次减退乎，人之身體，宛如一蓄電池，而蓄電池於新造時，荷電原子分解度甚强盛，故發生强大之電氣，及經一定之時日，則其荷電原子完全化合，成安定狀態之化學的化合物而不能發生電氣，是以電池之壽命，須與電解質和溶液之化學反應繼續之時間，成正比例，隨用電量愈多，用電時間愈久，則池内之電量愈遞减，與用電量及用電時間，成反比例，人體與此蓄電池無異，雖由攝取營養素中補充電氣發生物，而其輸入電量與消費電量，相差不同，故體内之發電量，卽逐漸减少，遂惹起病老之現象，人體内之各細胞，乃電氣發生之電池，人之腦髓，乃蓄積電氣之蓄電池，血液乃將電氣發生物質供給於細胞之導電物，故欲維持體内電氣量，則必待其（一）發電（二）蓄電（三）電氣發生物供給之三條件完全履行，然後始可完成，如有一種特殊方法，使電子之活動力常久繼續，則吾人之身體，可永免衰老，而得長生不死者矣，現代科學進步之速，有一日千里之勢，吾人曾認以神功造化者，今皆得以人工製造之，吾人最熱望之長生防老的大問題，亦隨電氣學，膠質化學，醫藥學等之發達，而始見解决之端倪，斯充電補藥「無量壽」之發明是也。</p>
<p>含電人參膠，「無量壽」之每一粒，皆含有人體所需要之電氣，爲生命原動力之感光發電池，若將此儲藏光電流之含電人參膠「無量壽」粒子，應用内服法，輸入於人體内，至其固形之膠質變化爲液體時，始故出其儲藏之電流，隨血液的循環，以轉達於人體之各細胞，故能供給吾人生命原動力之活電子，增進各細胞之分裂新生力，之延長至於無限期。</p>
<p>「無量壽」專治男女氣血虛弱，早老，衰老，視力减退，腦力衰弱，精力减通，陽痿，腎虧，遺精，神經衰弱，發育不全，動脈硬化，顏面早衰，腰背酸痛，各種消耗性疾患，憂鬱症，健忘症，失眠症，及一切官能性神經系疾患，有不可思議之神效</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>這是一個奇怪的題目，有說明的必要。</p>
<p>騎刦，不是戰國時代的燕將騎刦：乃是海盜混入</p>
<p>輪船，一聲號令，開始活動；强令駛船的聽着羣盜指揮，開往僻處，以便刦掠：騎住了船身行刦，這便呌做行刧，　大中華，不是我們的中華民國；乃是香港某公司的輪船，開往西貢，中途遭海盜的騎刦，這是上月的事，至今還没有破案：港粤各報都有詳細的記載。</p>
<p>輪船遇騎却，不足爲奇；所奇的，這輪船喚做大中華；而騎刦大中華的海盜又很有組織。放了一聲空槍，便把全船佔據，所有船主大副以及一切船員，都在海盜的統治之下！可憐的大中華！在那不抵抗中，遭受了一塲慘禍！</p>
<p>海盜得手以後，吩咐船主改換方向駛行，爲着避免往來輪船覺察起見；迫令船員把黃烟囱上面揩了一層黑黑油，又把船邊的大中華三個黃字，用油塗去；但是，英文名詞係雕刻而成，不能塗改，只好設法把來遮蔽了。可見賊有賊智，之般鬼鬼祟祟的僞組織，不知他們從那裏學來的？可笑，又是可嘆！</p>
<p>可憐的大中華，足有兩天之久，在那海盜的勢力範圍中！直待騎刦完畢，海盜他颶；大中華才能安然開回：雖然損失不貲，總算没有連船刦去，這是大中華不幸中的大幸。</p>
<p>大中華暫時遇騎刦，還不妨：大中華永久遇騎刦，便不得了！大中華三字在短時間被黑油抺去，還不妨，大中華三字在長時間被黑油抺去，便不得了！說起了南洋失事的大中華，便聯想到關久失事的大中華，非但抺去原名，而且又掛上了僞牌，唉！更進一層了！</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>｜無往而不矛盾｜</p>
<p>老友程君，是我在某通訊社時的同事，近已好久不見了。昨天承他突然來訪，相間之下，知道他近在郵件檢食所當檢查員。我間他爲什麽脫離新聞界，他說我並没有改行，不過因爲收入不敷，所以兼兼職而已。我當時不禁奇極，因爲他一方面在輿論界地位，主張言論自由，而在另一方面，則於法無據的｜｜因爲檢查兩字在當今最高法律的約法上，並無規定丨丨實行侵犯訓政時期約法所賦與人民的言論自由權丨丨約法第十五條丨丨豈非奇事？我就間他，這二種矛盾的生活，怎樣會得同時存在？他搖搖頭嘆口氣道：「你也不用間，二十世紀的事情，那一椿不是顯露着矛盾呢？口頭上說是「軍縮」，然而暗底裏却是「軍擴」；人民在鬧飢寒，而另一方面則在把米麥棉花傾棄燒掉：人家用槍砲打來，我們却在念咒退兵；關久義勇軍衣食不周的在冰天地地中奮鬥，而關内人士却在化數百萬元來賽一個會；黃包車夫單衣赤足在風雪中奔走喊熱，而坐車的穿着狐裘大衣說冷；他如····我說：『夠了夠了，你不必再發牢騷了，這眞是一個矛盾的社會。但有病須醫，總得找個出路才好』！他說：『誠然，我一方面在代民衆呼喊，力爭言論自由，然而在另一方面，我却把載有自已文字的報紙扣留起來，事情眞有點滑稽。然而我的生活是在這樣的夾縫中溜過了。有時我迷惘，似乎我並没有生活在世上，也曾想過不幹，然而除了這樣之外·還有什麽出路呢？世界不是到處都顯露着矛盾囑』？</p>
<p>『唉，矛盾的人生，矛盾的世界！』我悵然地說。</p>
<h3 id="c109">怎樣醫我們的健忘病 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 翁</p>
<p>丨抗日盡史所給矛的印象丨</p>
<p>法國福煦將軍曾說道：「國家最大的危機，在乎國民的健忘！」我們在春聞所受於敵人的痛苦恥辱，到了今天，在滬市大多數市民的腦海之中，不知還留着幾分之幾的殘影？那燈紅酒綠和酣歌恒舞的環境，是否已把隆隆的砲聲和慷慨的血花的印象，消磨得　糊不清丨或甚至不留影踪？這是關於我們國民健忘病的間題，委實是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>最近文華公司出版了一部「淞滬禦日血戰書史」，其中關於一二八之役的血戰狀况，圖片和文字都搜羅得十分詳盡。我把來翻閱了一回，不但使我像温舊夢似地，重新湧現出當時的種種慷慨激昂的印象，連抗日將士們的衝殺聲，和戰地同胞的號哭聲，也彷彿一聲聲從圖片上活躍出來丨因此、使我的平穩的呼及急促起來，我的漸漸歸於沉靜的血流，也重新沸騰起來！</p>
<p>健忘病是心理的而不是生理的。我大膽地說一句，這部「淞滬禦日血戰書史」可算是一種醫健忘的唯一良劑。我們若希望拔除病根，那末，這書不但應暫時的偶然的翻閱，而且還有永久置在案頭的價値！（移酬助東北義軍）</p>
<h3 id="c110">吹牛論 <a href="#c110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— 程魯丁</p>
<p>丨由梁作友　得來的一點感想丨</p>
<p>大唱進寳圖，排演空城計，所謂吹牛大王梁作友其人也者，乘興而來，敗興而歸，打馬返家，事已大白，心有所或，乃作吹牛之論，一俟有暇，再來拍馬之篇。</p>
<p>吹牛，吹牛，這適足以代表一般上海人的思想，又可以說這是一般中國人的現象！</p>
<p>我儘可以看見了許多吹牛的志士，我又可以看見了許多吹牛的英雄，但是我究竟不能相信他們是有若何的力量的，誇大的言論，虛僞的主張，固然，這是人所眩惑的，而且，在當時，在一刻，亦未始不得着相當的愛戴！</p>
<p>只是：只此一家並無分出的招牌，也難適應於稻香村，陸稿荐，一類的店舗，則紙紮的老虎，又何能經豺狗的呼嘯，而紙做的　籠，更安能受風雨的濛打，縱然是，一個人虛榮心，誇大性·這是常有的，而如謂吹牛者，有救於國，有益於事，則吾亦不信。</p>
<p>以吹牛的人來救國，國愈是無可救藥的，以吹牛的人來辦事，事愈是没有辦法的，若是說，吹牛的人有半點的用處，根本便是一句鬼話，而同時，吹牛的人，也是最淺溥最無聊的人。</p>
<p>其實，目可見物，不必自見，鏡可照人，不必自照，那末，牛又怎可自吹呢？所以，這就是梁作友的失敗處，這又是許多吹牛的朋友們的殷鑑處。</p>

<p>— 孫文溺</p>
<p>丨孝子賢孫的研究丨</p>
<p>人們不幸弄壞了一件自已心愛的東西，當然：一時頭上仍是怔怔的不捨得丢去·不錯，這就是愛的結果：痛惜的衝動·</p>
<p>父母，的確是人類中天性的愛·情之最切的寄託處·設或不幸有了一個死亡，當然是値得悲傷和哀思：爲了想表示心裏的哀痛，是不是除掉了用奢華的祭幛：隆重的出殯：舗張揚厲以外，没有第二種辦法？然而也應該想想，生前奉養是否能事之以禮，順親養志：克盡子職·如果你覺得或有一二處不能週到的地方，那末在這一時的風光，是否想爲死者出風頭：抑是爲生者！自已粉飾罪戾和撑塲面。</p>
<p>試問：『死者以入土爲安，』這話怎講！倘若你覺得不錯；那末只消去覓一塊風水不侵的高地，葬了死者遺骸，不致年陳月久有暴露之憂：顚來倒去之病：也就未嘗不是痛愛父母了。</p>
<p>話又說回來了，現在社會的潮流，是不是能夠讓人這樣去做丨的確是一個大問題·但是富有的爲了盲服潮流，而不惜虛糜金錢；不知體念父母之心，來創辦一點公益：所應得的罪咎，固就不必說·甚而致於貧窘之家，也不怕黄衣借債來撑塲面：這又是巷麽意思。</p>

<p>他並未領略到二十塊錢的菜，怎樣的好，只感到這一回的歡會，比前年納寵的喜酒有興，爲什麽要呆板的分着男女，女的一席，還要深深的藏在女廳裏去，畢况國民革命以後，社會有些生氣了。</p>
<p>他從晚風微襲，電眼怒張裏，薄有酒意的歸去，在孤獨的臥室襄，重新温理剛纔的事事物物。</p>
<p>他想家襄雖也有嬌妻和艶妾，但是「比較而後分優劣」，這公理無可逃免的，大夫人自然已經落伍了，不必提起，如夫人尙在妙齡，旣然能夠從鄉下毛丫頭轉變而成姨太太，何當不能再使伊轉變得摩登些呢。不能，儘管模樣兒摩登化了，那天眞未鑿的資質，無論如何，不能再加以琢麽了。不識一個字，如何使伊懂得小高爾夫，却爾斯登呢，在家裏聽慣的只是些十八世紀的話，那裏及得剛纔聽到的，可以作摩登姑娘語錄的妙言雋語呢。不能，决定不能，灰心了。</p>
<p>後來又想，我有的是錢，何妨在這裏再來一個，不算姨太太。算女朋友，得啦！女朋友很好，去追求罷，又興奮了。</p>
<p>灰心，興奮，交戰着，攪得一夜無眠。第二天，到部裏，又起了悵　。</p>
<p>小報上咒咀爲花瓶的女同志，在輕　活潑的動作裏，把公事擬好，送過來，字雖寫得欹斜些，有粉香遮董着·便不覺得幼稚了。語句雖有些費解，有尖銳清脆的話來解釋，也明白了。最好，常常有公事，由伊們送來，故意把公事推敲得精細些，纔有機會和伊談話。好久没有公事來了，便渡遇去，看伊們工作。想到「花瓶」，不禁暗讚小報的比提，挖苦得可喜，刻板的政治生涯，幸而有這種精神上的安慰，不至苦悶，可惜八小時工作太短。</p>

<p>但仔細一想，溥儀是日人的傀儡，再澈底地說，還是一個日人的囚徒，即使事成，他們可以再揀一個傀儡登場，老實說句話，事成與事敗，在大局上可說絶無關係，即使爲「殺狗給活猻看」，欲儆戒儆戒一般狐羣狗黨的漢奸，但是這種漢奸，天良喪盡，心肝全無，也决不會因此而有所感動，非欲把他們的心，一個個解剖開來，洗滌一下，或調換一個不可。</p>
<p>若照這樣說來，徐玉蘭等豈非白白犧牲了麽？不丨！决不，徐玉蘭事雖未成，但是她的氣槪，她的熱心，她的忠勇，是不可以磨滅的，顯見我中國人，不盡如一般無恥的漢奸，有錢可買，有利可誘，而尙有未死的人心，如一般義勇軍在關外苦寒凛冽中，與日人肉搏血戰，以爭我民族的生存，若得徐玉蘭等爲之互相策應，遙爲聲援，亦足以壯其士氣，而堅其殺敵之心。</p>
<p>女子，本來是男子的玩物，不能替國家做事，若再進一步說，竟若不齒於人類，然徐玉蘭如何，非但一般鬚眉漢奸對此汗顏，即關内一般有守土之責，負國家之重任者，對於徐玉蘭之謀炸溥儀一事，不知作何感想。</p>

<p>釀醋法原理　醋爲醋酸在水中之淡溶液，普通約含醋酸四，一○，酒爲醋酸細菌所侵犯，即變酸，惟此菌不能繁殖於酒精之純液中，必須有氮質物及鹽類爲其營養品，故製醋乃以果酒，麥酒，酒娘等爲起點，大約含酒精六至七％。酸化後酒精變爲醋酸，其變化如下式所示。</p>
<p>Ｃ２Ｈ５ＯＨ＋Ｏ２↓ＣＨ３ＣＯＯＨ＋Ｈ２Ｏ</p>
<p>酒精　　醋酸</p>
<p>同時有其他之化物生成，以醋醛爲最多，乃酒精氧化爲醋酸之中間物。</p>
<p>Ｃ２Ｈ５ＯＨ＋Ｏ↓ＣＨ３ＣＨＯ＋Ｈ２Ｏ</p>
<p>醋醛</p>
<p>大規模釀醋法　大規模製醋器爲木桶，其中有多孔假底，上舗木片成厚層，桶邊多孔，容空氣透入，酒由頂上漏斗加入，落於旋轉之盤，分爲酒花，灑於木片厚層，則醋酸菌迅速繁殖於木片上，發熱，隨使經過之酒氧化爲醋，醋菌繁殖之温度爲四十至四三度，醋須存置若干日月，使發生灑之香味，然後用砂濾過，所得之醋，含醋酸六％，可冲淡之，英國所謂第二十四號醋者，含酸五·五％更淡者爲第二十二號二十號十八號及十六號，第十六號者只含醋酸四，一％，以醋酸冲淡，加焦糖做色之醋，爲價賤之假醋。</p>
<p>山西釀醋法　以碗豆大麥兩種爲麵之原料，有時加紅小豆或黑豆，在取其色，其製造以暑期爲最適宜，法用大麥六十五分，碗豆三十分，紅小豆或黑豆五分，磨細加水適量　之，過乾不易生黴，過濕則不易成模，拌匀後置木模中。</p>
<p>壓成餅狀　取出置於高粱梗或麥桿之上，排列地下成行，周圍以生艾繞之，再置以兩重之紙或麥桿覆之，嚴閉窗牖，約經二三晝夜而發熱，表面上發生白綠色之斑點謂之上霉，若到期不能上霉，則餅上宜洒水濕之，仍覆之嚴閉窗牖，務使其上霉爲止，上霉之後，乃開窗通風，經三或四小時再閉窗，逐日翻動一二次，經兩星期而麯成，置於露天乾之，此時若將麯碎之，其内部現紅黃色，每塊重約二斤。</p>
<p>醋之原料爲黃小米及高粱，以小米六十分與高粱二十分，分别加水煑之，使熟成粥，混入缸中，俟其全冷，加麯二十分，攪拌均匀，用草蓋之，每日攪動一次，初時粥稠，七八日後逐漸變稀，月除後而醋漿成，乃混入小米糠，用水搓之至匀，不乾不濕，乾則易燥，濕則不易發熱，搓匀之後，混入缸中，以草蓋之，周圍以草圍之，此時屋中温度應在三十度左右，七日後，缸中之糟上層發熱，約厚三寸，用手上下搬動搓之，漸冷復蓋之，俟其發熱之層厚至五寸，仍用手上下搬動搓之，此後熱層逐日漸深。亦逐日揉搓，直至其熱至缸底後，仍每日揉搓一次，再經十餘日而糟成，糟成之後，加入缸中，缸有孔塞以葦管加水淋之，惟加入水時，宜先塞其管口約一小時，防其混也，淋出之醋，置於屋外，冬日凍之，棄冰留液，直至其醋液不凍而止，則醋漸濃厚，乃置於閉密甕中，存至一二年方可食用，愈陳愈佳。</p>

<p>一個深秋的黃昏，公園裏的草亭上，竚立着一個時髦的少女。游客已陸續</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>地徴去了，她還在亭裏引領遙望着園門；一壁自言自語：</p>
<p>（少女）怎麽還不見來？他從來没失過約啊！難道他已猜着我的隱意，明知我要和他絶交，故意地不見我的面嗎？！走了吧！還呆呆地等他做甚麽？·········</p>
<p>她說到這裏，正欲多步走開；園外忽然怱怱地走進一個少年來。少年剛入園門，便立定四顧尋找。她於是先招呼道：</p>
<p>（少女）楷哥，我在這裏呢；我已等你好久了！</p>
<p>少年聞言，立刻健步上前，正想和她握手；她却拒絶了。</p>
<p>（少年）（含笑地）啊，模妹，你莫非怪我來遲了嗎？我這兩天實在忙得不了，剛才因爲擬了一個啓事的稿子，要在六點前到送到報館裏去，所以躭延了好久，累妹妹在此等候，我心裏也實在不安！不過妹妹非是外人，想來總可以原諒的！</p>
<p>（少女）（搖頭嘆氣）千言萬語都不必談；總之，我們今後只能有友朋的關係了！我現在約你來，也就爲的和你解除婚約！</p>
<p>（少年）（面色立變）妹妹，你這話是從何處說起；你旣没有任何的阻碍，我也未曾絲毫的變心；你究竟還有什麽隱衷，不防告訴我明白！</p>
<p>（少女）唉！你該知道：我的愛只付給兩個。一個是國，一個是你。但愛國還比愛你重要，現在不能敎我因愛你而不愛國啊！</p>
<p>（少年）妹妹，你這話是何所指而云然？</p>
<p>果眞確切不錯，那末，我一定允許你；完成你愛國的壯志！</p>
<p>（少女）這個你還問我嗎；你的父親甘做賣國的奸商，不顧國人唾駡地販賣仇貨；除奸團警戒他没有用，市商會勸導他也不理；這幾天同學們冷嘲熱諷，都說我是賣國奸商的媳婦。你想，他們駡我是猫是狗，我都可以忍耐；騙是她們說我與賣國的人有了關係，我如何受得下去？唉，楷哥，你要原恕我不得已的苦衷，允許了我的要求，才可消滅我良心上的痛苦。</p>
<p>（少年）（哈哈大笑）原來爲此！原來爲此！······</p>
<p>（少女）（嗔怒）你難道情願和我離異嗎？你難道也受了你的父親的傳染嗎？唉！·····</p>
<p>（少年）你還不知道，我已和我父親斷絶關係了，剛才擬的啓事，明天各報上就可以登出來了！你愛國，我豈不愛國嗎？只恨我没有手槍，不然，老早就演出「大義滅親」的故事，將他一槍打死了！本來我早有和他脫離的决心，只因讀書的經濟没有解决；現在一切都謀到相當的辦法了，還有什麽顧忌呢？······</p>
<p>（少女）（轉怨爲喜）哦，楷哥，眞的嗎？········</p>
<p>她說着依偎到他的懷中，他就着她接了一個甜蜜的長吻：良心上都充滿了一種不可言說的快樂。</p>

<h3 id="c233">廢止應酬文字的建議　持佛 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>的確我們中國人，最講禮節的，試　看書信的來往，付麽「膝下」「尊前」「閣下」「福體」「道履」「芝儀」······等等，說得非常有禮，非常卑謙，其實呢，做子弟的未必懂道理，交朋友的未必講信義，一言不合，反臉無情，利害關頭，非常　勁，踐常平日來往的信來一讀，好像兩個人一般。這是甚麽綠故。也許是我們中國人「虛僞」的惡劣根性吧。</p>
<p>說到應酬的文字，甚麽壽序啦，祭文啦，賀詩啦，輓聯啦，慕誌銘啦，誄詞啦，行述啦，哀啓啦，以及一切幛語，銀盾上的祝頌語，没有不鬼話連篇，虛僞百出，明明這人没有可記的事實，可贊美的功德，莫不說得天花亂墜，可泣可歌，這又不是我們中國人「虛僞」的惡劣根性嗎？</p>
<p>本來諛墓文字，唐代已經盛行，賀祝生人的文字，歷史還不悠久，所以歸震川作人壽序說，其事非古了，可是拍活人馬屁的文字，已經可笑，拍死人馬屁的文字，更可笑了，古人只有贈序，多有勗勉的意思，現在人只知道拍馬，或者自已來吹牛，和古人的意思，完全不同了。</p>
<p>現在有一種文人，專門以文字拍活死人馬屁爲業，自已還說非常清高，甚麽壽序一百元，輓詩三十元，賣文爲生，情願不去做官，丨或許是太史，翰林，前清遺老，丨你想：做壽序，不是說人家「福壽全歸」嗎？做輓詩，不是嘆人家「哲人其萎」「駕返瑤池」嗎？吃開口飯的朋友·遇到了堂會必來恭維幾句好話，做僕役的，遇到了主人喜慶等事，也要講幾句好話，才可領賞，那末，這般賣文爲活的大文豪，來運其生花之筆，去頌掦人家，以博潤資，不是和吃開口飯的以及婢僕們，有甚麽區别呢！我在裝璜店裏，瞧見大文豪題名簿，高可隱人，便想到他們生意興隆，畢竟比我們投稿的文丐，强得多咧。</p>
<p>講到受這種無聊祝頌文的人，似夫也不必肉麻當有趣，訕諷當光榮，千篇一律的祝頌慶弔文字，不妨買本「酬世寳典」來鈔幾篇，何必出了許多金錢，來請敎這般無聊的居士文豪呢，况且名不副實，受之也非常有愧啊，可是把這種無聊的刻板文章送人，也大可不必，你是闊人，你寫了一篇毒駡的文字送他，他也得之如拱壁，你要是一個無名小卒，任你做得甚麽好，那闊人廳堂雖大，你的大作，也没有你立壁角之分，所以在下有一個皮氣，從不願把祝頌文送人，又不願去求所謂名士文豪也者，題一個字，寫一篇文，如果這事確有紀念的可能，不妨在一本簿册上，請幾位眞知已的親友，各簽了一個名，倒確可留作紀念品咧，不曉得本欄編者和讀者，以爲怎樣？</p>

<p>外國人學别一國的言語文字，是用來做研究該國文化學術的工具，所以只見他們埋着頭在做工夫；僅有，僅有大中華的國民學外國語是用來做飯瓢子，飯筷子的，所以只見他們很漂亮的在嘴巴上做工夫。有人說：「次殖民地的人民不會說漂亮的洋話，就不能在洋行裏帮洋人做買辦，當然也不能發洋財，住洋房子，享洋福······」</p>
<p>說洋話，當飯吃，倒是咱們貴國特有的獨創的鐵飯碗，開天下空前絶後的新紀錄！</p>
<p>Ｘ　　　Ｘ　　　　Ｘ</p>
<p>摩登男女，無論是演說或談天，最喜歡夾一二字或一二句洋話。有人說，這是很時髦的。有一次，我問一個說話素愛夾洋話的朋友爲甚麽要打「洋涇浜」，他說：「有時說話不能達意，有時想不出適當的中國字，有時用英文思想要比較來得快些······」</p>
<p>若說夾洋話是時髦，是出風頭，那還情有可原，因爲這有他的自由：若說「中國人說中國話不容易達意，思想來得遲鈍」是眞的，那我可要懷疑先生在講臺上告訴我的「五千年的古國，唯一的文化之邦」，要是這册歷史在我手邊，我必撕成片片，問牠爲甚麽欺騙我？丨牠竟大言不慚不怕羞愧麽？丨？！</p>

<p>上海的店家，範圍比較大的總是雙開間，規模小的是單開間：這誰也知道，但始終没有人把「單開間」「雙開間」形容到人的身上去！有，就是Ｃ君</p>
<p>老友Ｃ君：他是我的朋友中最滑稽而最會譏剌的一個，他時常找旁人身上的缺點來提「綽號，」同事Ｙ君皮色是黑的，他呌他「安南巡捕，」老徐歡喜修飾的，他呌他「兎子」······總之他很公允地會替你每個人提個綽號。</p>
<p>因了他善於取樂，便演了下面一齣武劇，這也許是他的報應吧！</p>
<p>事情發生在前天的下午，劇情是這樣的：客堂璧上滿掛了許多字畫，兩邊零亂的有幾只几凳，中間一張八仙桌，坐着四個人，正在忙着劈劈拍拍打牌，左首坐的是Ｈ君，Ｈ君的下家就是專尋人家開心的Ｃ君，Ｈ君牌鬭的很厲害，輕易不肯給下家吃一張，Ｃ君輸去了七八塊錢，心裏怎不氣憤，總想在Ｈ君身上找一個缺點來洩憤消氣。</p>
<p>原來Ｈ君兩隻眼睛幼時瞎了一隻，變成獨目，於是Ｃ君報復的機會來了。</p>
<p>『眇先生！爲什麽你出來的牌我一張吃不着？』Ｃ君用一副諷剌的臉孔向Ｈ君問。</p>
<p>『·········』</p>
<p>『你爲甚呌他眇先生呵！』坐在Ｃ君對過的挿嘴了。</p>
<p>『他不是少了一人隻目嗎？少目兩字拼起來不是『眇』先生是什麽！』經他的明白解釋，引的大家哄堂大笑。</p>
<p>Ｈ君紅着臉，惟有隻目怒視。</p>
<p>拍拍的牌聲不斷地繼續了個把鐘頭，Ｃ君依舊很少吃到上家Ｈ君的牌，心裏非常懷恨，又給Ｈ君取了一個綽號丨單開間。</p>
<p>要是『單開間給我吃一張邊三萬，我四七萬清一色早就和了！』Ｃ君朝其餘二家笑着說。</p>
<p>『好一個「單開間」的名詞丨又别緻，又適當。哈······』</p>
<p>『你再敢說「單開間」我佩服你』Ｈ君火冒了。</p>
<p>『偏要說「單開間，」你預備怎樣？』　　Ｈ君動手就是一拳，Ｃ君豈肯示弱，當即起立回擊，接着二人扭作一團，於是零亂的脚步聲，椅子傾地聲以及嘴裏呌着你來！你來！聲，同時並作，其他二位義不容辭向雙方勸解，依然無效。復經二人武力調停拉開，始各罷手，結果Ｃ君臉上平添了幾處指印的傷痕「單開間」Ｈ君撕碎了一件長衫。一幕武劇，總算告一段落，拍拍底牌聲，也宣告停止了！</p>

<h3 id="c236">日本的戰爭影片 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— 淩鶴</p>
<p>根據岸雄著日本電影之最近階段</p>
<p>自「九一八」「一二八」事變以後。日本攝製了不少的戰爭電影。由於「許多爲了擁護滿洲帝國權益之悲壯的情報。每日在報紙上宣傳起來（原著語句｜以下同。）「肉彈三勇士的尊貴的犧牲。人柱四勇士的武勳。古賀聯隊長的古武士式的盡節。都足以振盪日人的心弦。於是日本的戰爭影片。便建築在這些事實（？）之上」。「其中當推松竹影片公司的滿洲進行曲爲佳作。」</p>
<p>在這一影片中却有許多「戰後生活的描寫」。反之。其他的戰爭影片。多是自始至終描寫着勇敢的日本軍和敵軍的倒戈。而這影片却是着重於戰後的日人之苦楚。</p>
<p>此外還有日活的「征空大襲擊。」這和清水宏導演的「陸軍大進行同樣。」目的在給與觀衆以歷史的知識和崇拜英雄的信念。一種乾燥無味的作品。</p>
<p>以上海事變爲背景的。有「爆彈三勇士」。在這影片中「先有戰爭直前的上海之姿。許多排日羣衆呐喊着打倒日本人。日本僧侶遭受華人之慘殺。」「這些事實是否屬實。我們不得而知。」然而「正爲日本出兵之理由了。至於這種理由是否正順。我們亦無可置言。然而就此說明其所以發生戰爭的原因。在電影的結構上却是非常重要的。」</p>
<p>如上所述。日本的戰爭影片。就完成了軍國民敎育的任務。而且經過軍部　　親切的指導。更能使這些影片成爲日本統治者的宣傳煽動之工具了。</p>

<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>嘉寳是離開人們了，我們可以聊以自慰的，就是瑪琳迪脫許的MarleneDietrich她在藍天使和墨洛哥兩片中，給人們的印象是很不懷的。</p>
<p>在今天光陸蘭心兩家同時開映的金髮愛神BlondeVenus使人對她有進一步的認識，瑪琳確係在藝術之路上進的，她表演得非常體貼：她能以沉默而使劇情格外緊張。</p>
<p>配角是些新角色，都還不錯。飾迪脫許兒子的小孩，呌狄干特墨爾DickidMoore是値得人們注意的，他天眞活潑的表演呌這片生色不少，眞可以和大衛李，較一下短長。</p>
<p>導演原是歐州大陸的有名人物，他能運用神妙手段，呌這片子怎樣的動人！許多地方，用間接的暗寫，全片從小的地方着眼，這種精彩，當然是應歸功於他的。</p>
<p>劇情是再平凡也没有了，如果你看了這片的本事，你一定不相信這樣好的片子，會由這麽平凡故事產生出來，但是事實却往往不然。</p>
<p>附帶再說幾句，昨天第一塲光陸，只先映了一本炭畫，以後就休息，休息以後演正片，而第一本演完之時又停了兩分種，第二本又有多一半變成無聲，這大約是兩家同時映，忙的緣故，我想兩院同映一片，寗可一家三點鐘，一家三點一刻，不然的話，這種毛病會常有的。</p>

<p>— 陳大悲</p>
<p>專信天力而不信自已能力的明星們，自命爲天才而藐視後進的明星們，所信仰的也許中不錯。因爲他們自已知道他們自已並没有能力，所以徼倖而被稱爲明星者，無藝是碰巧的命運而已。所以他們公然自認，除了靠天吃飯之外，别無能力。這樣的明星越多，銀幕的表演藝術離光明越遠。幸而現今中國電影界中，只有一部分的所謂明星作如是想，中國電影界還不至於完全埋葬在黑暗中。</p>
<p>將來被稱爲「明星」者將不能像現在這樣容易。今天享受明星榮譽的人，如果在五年之後，還祗仗着天力，還祗仗着奥援，而不加上一點自已獨習的功夫，在表演藝術上想出爭雄取勝的方法來，我敢斷定，他决不好意思再聽人稱他爲明星了。</p>
<p>眞有藝術修養的明星，决不會怕人數太多的。不但在年齡幼稚的中國電影界裏不會怕多，就連美國這樣老資格的電影界。還時時感到缺乏呢丨中國電影事業之所以進步遲緩，所以爲一班愛看舶來片的朋友們笑爲不足齒數者，惟一的原因，就是因爲那種明星多半並没有得到藝術修養的機緣，的如何修養的方法。而已經掛了明星的招牌，如果電影事業不停止競爭和進步，電影界裏决不至對於有藝術修養的明星嫌他太多的。</p>
<p>電影常識</p>
<h3 id="c245">美丨並非明星所必需的 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>

<p>一般人講到女明星的成功，總以爲美貌是唯一要素，其實，這觀念是錯誤的，而且恰功相反，我們甚至可以說，美貌並非爲一顆女星所必要，也許有幾種角色需要美貌，但並非美貌就能造成影幕上的成功。</p>
<p>攝影機所尋覓着的，重要的表情，不善於内心的表演，縱然有着好看的臉貌，也是等於泥塑木彫，一些用處都没有，就是在平常社交之間，海潑善於表情的女友，也是最受大衆的歡迎，而在銀幕上，則這些表情，附了使人覺得快活之外，還有對於劇情更大的任務，的姑娘們，是許多許多，而且都是爲了對於自已的美，有幾分把握，才遠道趕來的，在這許多美人兒之中，導演先生，又何從加以選擇呢，而且那些已出名，而並非十分美的明星，丨如嘉寳，丨又如何能在這許多美人間，出人頭地呢。</p>
<p>這就中表情的重要了，就說嘉寳，丨講究點說，她是不能算做美人兒的，但是她所缺乏的，却由她的才藝來補足了，所以她仍是贏得大部份觀衆的愛護。</p>
<p>安娜司丹AnnaSten這最近加入好萊塢的俄國女伶，也是同樣情形，如其把司丹女士，放在一羣職業女子之間，誰也不會注意到她，但是在銀幕上，她眞摯的表演，使她在紅星之間，也佔得一席，</p>
<p>瓊克拉馥，在賽美大會中，决不能出風頭，但她的藝術，却使她比一般空着薄浴衣的肉感女郎，更吸引人家洋意，露絲却脫呑，也因爲她個性的魔力，使她在影界上一路順風。</p>
<p>再說最不好看的老太婆，海倫漢斯HelenHayes她一生善長於表演聲名狼藉的老婦人，眞是「海龍活現」，她的成功，除了因爲長於做作的技能之外，可說與「美」之一字，是風馬牛不相及的。</p>
<p>因種種方面的例子，我們可以下一個結論說，明星所需要的，並非祗是美，就夠的。</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Sincerity of Preparing a New Front for the Economic War Against Japan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the September 18th Incident last year, terrifying waves have been stirred up between the Chinese and Japanese nations. Consequently, wars of various natures have been continuously unfolding between the two countries. In diplomacy, the behind-the-scenes maneuvers at the League of Nations General Assembly are very obvious. In military affairs, the January 28th Shanghai Incident and the ongoing and increasingly expanding battles between the Northeast volunteer armies and the Japanese army are also well known to the world. Economically, since September 18th, China's boycott of Japanese goods and Japan's recent dumping policies are also tit-for-tat.</p>
<p>Since the widespread unfolding of various wars, China has not been able to adjust its pace and fight in a unified manner. Diplomatically, it has often been in a passive position. Militarily, although the January 28th Shanghai Incident lasted for more than a month, it ultimately retreated due to insufficient reinforcements. Only the volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast, with their outstanding spirit and superior strategies, have fought persistently with the Japanese army, making it impossible for the Japanese to consolidate their rule in the Northeast. This is what the Japanese fear and find most difficult. Hanzawa Gyokujo, the editor of the Japanese Diplomatic Times, once said in a secret document titled "How to Deal with Manchuria" that "...Therefore, maintaining law and order is extremely difficult. If we send the Manchurian army (?) to suppress them, it will be just right for them (referring to the volunteer armies) to take advantage of it. This is truly a hateful and ridiculous thing. If we send our loyal soldiers to suppress them, it would be a pity and involve considerable sacrifices. Japanese soldiers certainly have the courage and training to win against powerful enemy countries, but they are not good at fighting against these irregular plainclothes troops and bandits (?). It is like being an extremely skilled swimmer in the ocean or a large river, but it is difficult to swim in the mud." In his exaggerated negative, he has effectively revealed his fear of our volunteer armies. Moreover, the weakness of the Japanese army's combat effectiveness in the Shanghai Incident has been thoroughly exposed by our 19th Route Army. Therefore, in military struggles, China has not suffered any significant defeats.</p>
<p>Currently, the most worrying and dangerous thing is the economic war. Not long after the September 18th Incident, China's steps in the economic war against Japan were indeed quite adjusted. Under the enthusiastic national sentiment, the Japanese economy suffered a very serious blow. This strategy is indeed the best way to defeat the enemy in China: solidify the defenses, clear the fields, and engage in protracted warfare. If it can be maintained for several years, Japan's entire front will inevitably show signs of chaos and the overall situation will collapse. However, due to our side's initial momentum fading, the formation became disorganized, and the war's fortresses were all breached. As of now, we have instead fallen into a situation of overall decline, showing dangerous signs.</p>
<p>Since September, imports of Japanese goods have gradually increased. The previously deserted market has regained vitality. In recent months, Japan has intensified its dumping policy, and Japanese goods have surged in, once again dominating our markets. Taking coal as an example, dumping began in June. Fushun coal could have made huge profits if sold in Shenyang and Dalian, but Japanese merchants disregarded the heavy profits and dumped it in Shanghai and Hankou at a low price of just over six taels or even five taels per ton. Each ton also had to be sold at a loss of more than two taels. Recently, some tons have been as low as just over three taels. Competing with our domestic coal, which has weak capital and extremely high freight and taxes, is like crushing dry weeds and rotten wood. The coal market has been monopolized by them. According to customs statistics, Shanghai imported 29,797 tons of Japanese coal in August and 43,144 tons in September, an increase of 45% compared to August. This aggressive dumping policy is extremely vicious. Coal is like this, and other goods such as yarn, cloth, paper, silk, and cement are no exception. Thus, our economic war front against Japan has completely collapsed. Not only are we currently in a state of failure, but the foundation of our national industry has also been fundamentally shaken due to this powerful blow, which is extremely dangerous and worrying.</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that China's current economic war front urgently needs to be reorganized. First, the entire nation should fully develop the spirit of cherishing national products to promote domestic goods and defend against dumping policies, and persevere in this consistently and firmly. Second, the government should pay more attention to promoting and cherishing national industry, especially by reducing tax rates to lower the cost of domestic goods. Third, transportation should be fully facilitated to reduce freight costs. Fourth, domestic industries should avoid internal competition and concentrate their efforts to unite against foreign forces. Fifth, financiers should focus on the interests of the entire nation and invest more in industry to cultivate the foundation of national industry. Sixth, customs should raise tax rates to prevent the dumping of foreign goods. If we can implement each of the above six items, it will not be difficult to turn defeat into victory in the economic war against Japan. The overall situation of the Sino-Japanese contention can also present a turning point.</p>
<p>Japan's economy is already riddled with holes, and the devastation of its rural areas is a fatal blow. The form of its military is strong, but the reality of its economy is weak. If we can take advantage of this weakness by exploiting the gaps and weaknesses, we can achieve final victory. The Greek poet Homer once described in his epic poem a myth about the Greek child Achilles, saying that Achilles was sickly as a child, and the gods immersed him in the river, turning him into copper skin and iron bones. However, because the gods held his heel tightly at the time, it was never exposed to water, making it the only weak point in his entire body. Later, Achilles died in battle, and his death was due to this point. Now, the form of Japan's military is strong, but the weakness of its economy is no different from Achilles' heel. Let us identify this heel, use our nation's only economic weapon of self-defense, and deliver a final and powerful blow.</p>

After the opening of the Suining Conference, according to the documents and previous agreements on governing Sichuan, they will proceed with dividing the defense areas and drafting a former grass plan, which will be submitted to the central government's high officials entering Sichuan. According to the Sichuan army representatives stationed in Nanjing, the two Liu's troops began a major battle on the 8th. The areas of fierce fighting are in Luzhou, Neijiang, and Leshan (ie Jiading). If Liu Wenhui is defeated this time, he will either communicate with western Kang, whether to abandon Luzhou and preserve Leshan to communicate with Yunnan and Guizhou, or abandon Leshan and defend Jianyang and Chengdu to prepare to retreat into western Kang. Liu Wenhui himself is currently weighing the pros and cons and is in the process of considering and preparing. (8th Dispatch)</p>

On the morning of the 8th, they briefly stopped at Yuezhou, changed to the Chuyou warship and sailed downstream, escorted by the Weisheng warship, arriving in Hankou at 7:05 PM. They usually went to the Yih Wah Village residence to rest. Dai Chuanxian, Soong Tzu-wen, and Zhang Qun all went to pay their respects and hold discussions. Yu Hsueh-chung did not arrive in Hankou on the 8th and his visit has been rescheduled. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Soong Tzu-wen flew from Xun at 8 AM on the 8th to Nanjing and then flew to Hankou at 11 AM, arriving at Wangjiadun Airport at 2:30 PM. Soong said that because Chiang Kai-shek was about to go to Jiangxi, he rushed to meet him. The Third Plenary Session is determined to be held as scheduled. He will leave Hankou after meeting Chiang. Soong is staying at the Central Bank and then visited Dai Chuanxian for a long discussion. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Soong Tzu-wen, accompanied by Donald and Huang Chundao, flew from Shanghai to Nanjing on the morning of the 8th, arriving at Ming Palace Airport at 9 AM. He went directly to the Executive Yuan by car to attend the Executive Yuan meeting. The meeting ended at 10:45 AM. Soong, accompanied by Donald, Huang Chundao, and Chen Fengzhen, took off for Hankou at 11:10 AM. Soong told reporters that he wanted to meet with Chairman Chiang before he went to Jiangxi to discuss finance. The Third Plenary Session: Chiang may come to Nanjing to attend. No loans were discussed with the banking community in Shanghai. Recent tax revenues are strong and sufficient to cope. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Soong Tzu-wen told reporters: 1. It is not surprising that a large amount of silver is being transported from Shanghai banks to the Northeast. The Northeast is originally our country's territory. Since it was occupied by Japan, we are seeking to recover it. During this transitional period, the credit of the Bank of Communications and other branches outside the customs must also be maintained and cannot be regarded as foreign. Moreover, there are still 30 million of our compatriots in the three northeastern provinces. If we allow its financial system to stagnate, not only will the 30 million compatriots directly suffer economic pain, but it will also provide the Japanese with an opportunity to manipulate finances. Therefore, this matter is purely for the purpose of supporting the financial turnover of the Bank of Communications branches and has no other intentions. 2. The rumor that the government is negotiating with the banking community for huge loans is completely untrue. Although the national treasury is currently strained, it can still be maintained with effort after austerity measures. I can responsibly state that there will be no further borrowing from the banking community. 3. The government plans to continue purchasing 450,000 tons of American wheat because the provinces have had bumper harvests this year, and rice prices will naturally fall, while wheat harvests have been very poor. Wheat stocks in flour mills everywhere are also running out. Even if the government does not purchase American wheat, commercial factories will still have to order from the United States or Canada. This is a factual necessity and has nothing to do with the drop in rice prices. 4. Regarding the proposal to abolish the tael and adopt the yuan, the government is still planning it. It is not yet certain whether it can be implemented by New Year's Day next year. The Central Mint has been prepared and there will be no problem when it starts operating in the future. 5. The Third Plenary Session will be convened in Nanjing. The issue of the National Government moving back will be discussed and decided by the Third Plenary Session. Soong made a brief answer to reporters at the airport: 1. This trip to Hankou is because the suppression of bandits in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces is about to end. Chairman Chiang is scheduled to return to Hankou today and will transfer to Nanchang to supervise the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi. Because various important cases of the Central Political Committee need to be discussed with Standing Committee Member Chiang, and the situation in Sichuan will also be discussed in detail. He will return to Nanjing in about one or two days. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Despite numerous meetings with Karakhan, attempts to conclude a non-aggression treaty have yielded no results. According to those familiar with Sino-Soviet relations, Soviet Russia knows that a direct conflict with Japan at this time is not beneficial, so it is happy to conclude a treaty. However, the Japanese side insists on first recognizing the rebellious organization, which is absolutely impossible to agree to. Internal opinions in Japan are also divided. The civilian faction advocates concluding a treaty immediately to avoid diplomatic isolation, while the military faction is willing to conclude a treaty regardless of conditions, resulting in [an impact on] its military actions in East Asia. In short, the interests of both sides conflict and they have ulterior motives. A treaty is absolutely impossible. Matsuoka's trip is just a bluff. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) It was previously reported that a Japanese banking group had agreed to lend 30 million Japanese yen to the "Manchukuo" government. It is now reported that "Manchukuo" has informally completed all the procedures for issuing this bond in Japan. It is also reported that it was informally agreed that the Japan Industrial Bank would underwrite the bond, while the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Chosen would provide assistance. The bond is issued at a price of 97, with an interest rate of 5%, and a five-year repayment period. It is secured by the salt tax and opium monopoly revenue of the Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. According to the "Manchukuo" government, this loan will be used to maintain public order, build a new administration, and provide relief for the floods in northern Manchuria. It is reported that the Yokohama Specie Bank has telegraphed the British and American members of the four-nation banking group related to loans to China, asking them to assist in the sale of this bond.

<p>Wu Zhihui Discusses Defending Against Insults and Saving the Nation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 12th, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, it is said that Sun Ke plans to attend the commemorative meeting. Sun has been discussing and drafting proposals for the Third Plenary Session with Central Committee members in Shanghai. Sun's opinions are still based on his previous program for saving the nation, focusing on the recovery of lost territories in the Northeast by force. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's proposals also focus on national defense and diplomacy. After the Third Plenary Session, Sun may have a seat as one of the heads of the Yuan. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Zhihui arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai and said, "I came here because President Dai went to Luoyang to take office, and the Central Government sent me to supervise the oath-taking. The current government system is the result of the First Plenary Session, where all parties fought for their interests. If the chairman has no real power, then the chairman's position, although it exists, will not be fought for, and even if it is fought for, it will not be done effectively. The Yuan system is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocacy, clearly stated in the Outline of National Reconstruction, but opinions differ on the timing of its establishment. Now that the five Yuans have been established, it is better to maintain the original system than to reorganize it in the future. The Third Plenary Session can be convened. The Executive Department has delegated representatives, and it doesn't matter whether they are called representatives. If they can come, let them come; if they cannot come, use representatives as a cover. As for the issue of voting rights, we will discuss it when the time comes. I have never seen disputes over power within the Kuomintang. The way out for China is peace. Without civil war, the people will naturally be rich and the country will be strong. If there is constant fighting and turmoil, causing the people to be poor and the finances to be depleted, no system of governance will work, civilization will not advance, and order will not be maintained. Someone asked me how China can defend against insults and save the nation now. I replied: 'Not fighting can save the nation, not fighting can defend against insults.'" (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said, "Newspapers reported that Central Committee members staying in Guangdong have elected representatives to attend the plenary session. The Central Government has not received a formal report from Guangdong. However, according to legal principles and precedents, Central Committee members attend Central meetings as individuals. If an individual has factual difficulties and cannot attend, they may give up their right to attend. In past Central plenary sessions, we have never heard of a group of committee members who, because they cannot attend or disregard attendance, elect one or two people as representatives. From this, it can be seen that the saying that the Central Committee members staying in Guangdong have elected representatives is actually illegal. As for proposals jointly signed by individuals or multiple people being submitted to the conference by someone else, this is common and cannot be equated with electing representatives."

<h3 id="e20">Executive Yuan Bans Insulting Any Religion <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Bei Xin and Nanhua Punished Separately</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming Will Issue an Apology</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan issued a circular on the 8th, the original text of which is as follows: "Ethnic equality and freedom of religion are the basic principles of our party. Based on these principles, the National Government has always spared no effort to support and protect all ethnic groups and religions in the country. The Muslim people are an important component of the Republic of China. Their contributions to the party and the country are obvious and they have always been respected throughout the country. However, it has been found that Bei Xin Bookstore and Nanhua Literary Society have distributed texts that insult Islam, which is extremely absurd. Although the incident is minor, it is feared that rumors will spread far and wide, causing misunderstandings. The relevant authorities have been ordered to severely punish them separately in accordance with the law in order to warn against imitation and to maintain law and order. In the future, all kinds of publications must not contain any insults to any religion. In addition to enforcing the law, the government hopes that all parties will know how to love others and respect their work, set aside differences, and unite in common purpose. At this time of national crisis, we should truly unite and avoid causing incidents over trivial matters. Let us encourage each other. This order is issued." (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At the Central Talk Association on the 8th, regarding the case of Bei Xin and Nanhua insulting Muslims, it was decided that the Central Propaganda Committee and the Executive Yuan would take strict action separately. The Executive Committee resolved on the 8th: (1) To telegraph Wu Tiecheng to deal with Bei Xin strictly in accordance with the law in conjunction with the court. (2) Nanhua Literary Society has voluntarily suspended publication. The author, Lou Zikuang, will be handed over to the court for severe punishment. (3) A circular was issued to all publications in the country, stating that in the future, they must not publish texts that insult any religion or provoke ethnic hatred. The circular was issued on the 8th. Zeng Zhongming will also publish an apology to Muslims in the newspaper within a few days. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zeng Zhongming will issue an apology for the Nanhua insult to the Muslim case. The original text is as follows: "I have been busy for months, and although I bear the name of editor-in-chief of Nanhua Literary Society, I have had no time to proofread. As a result, Lou Zikuang's article in issue 14 offended my Muslim friends. The responsibility for negligence rests entirely on me. Although I received sincere forgiveness from the Shanghai Qingzhen Board of Directors in late September, in light of this fact, I was not only negligent in noticing it, but it also contradicted my usual political views. I would like to reiterate this so that during this period of national crisis, the advocacy of sincere unity will not be hindered by my personal oversight. I respectfully offer my apologies and hope that my Muslim friends and friends at home and abroad will understand and appreciate this." (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

According to news from the foreign side, the reasons for France's hesitation on the Sino-French Vietnam border trade agreement issue are: (1) the Yunnan customs tariff dispute; and (2) the Longzhou incident. The misunderstanding over the Yunnan customs tariff has now been completely resolved, and the Longzhou incident has also been resolved with a memorandum signed by Zhu Zhaoxin and French Counselor Legard in Guangdong. It can be considered completely resolved. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Ge Guangting, the chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee, arrived in Nanjing. He stated that regarding the issue of redeeming the railway, the current monthly income of the entire railway is about 1.2 million yuan. After deducting 800,000 yuan for engineering and administrative expenses, a surplus of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan remains. However, the railway's debt is 40 million yuan. Paying interest at 6% per year requires 2.4 million Japanese yen, which requires 200,000 yuan per month. Comparatively, there may still be accumulated surplus. He had a plan for the redemption of the railway, using the current railway assets of 60 million yuan as a fund, issuing 40 million yuan in public bonds, and repaying the Japanese debt at once. After that, the principal and interest on the public bonds would be repaid monthly from the accumulated surplus of the railway. Before the principal and interest on the public bonds were fully repaid, the Central Government could not withdraw the railway funds. Later, due to the outbreak of the national crisis and the soaring price of gold in the past few years, it has not been realized. He will propose discussions with the Ministry of Railways authorities on this trip to Nanjing. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>40 Million Voters Nationwide Participated in the Voting</p>
<p>Who Will Be the Next Head of State Will Be Known Tonight</p>
<p>Public Sentiment Departs From Hoover, Making It Difficult to Compete With Roosevelt</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 7th Dispatch: Tomorrow is the day of the US presidential election. The final broadcast tonight will urge 40 million voters nationwide to go to the polling stations tomorrow, rain or shine, to vote. The US Weather Bureau will also issue weather forecasts as usual, informing election officials and voters where clear weather is expected and where rain is expected, requiring preparation of rain gear. Polling stations across the country will begin voting at 6:00 AM tomorrow. Some states will close at 6:00 PM in the evening, while others will close at 9:00 PM. According to regulations, even after the closing time, voters already inside the polling station can still vote as usual, and the ballot box will not be sealed until everyone has voted. Therefore, sometimes the sealing time may even be extended by more than one hour. However, the laws of some states also stipulate that if all voters on the electoral register have voted, the ballot box can be sealed and the votes counted even before the closing time. As for the vote counting time, some areas can complete it within one hour. According to those familiar with election affairs, if the election trend is as predicted and leans towards one side, then who the next president will be can be known by 1:00 AM on Wednesday (2:00 PM Shanghai time on Wednesday). Otherwise, it will take another one or two hours to be certain.</p>
<p>World News Agency reports that the US general election has already begun yesterday, and its final result is of great importance to the international political situation. Here is a translation of the Miller's Review's article on the US political parties' views on this election for reference:</p>
<p>On November 8, American men and women of voting age will all vote to elect the head of state who will govern American politics for the next four years. Although the focus of the election competition is between the Republican and Democratic parties, there are actually nine political parties participating in the competition, with ten presidential candidates. The reason why there are nine parties with ten candidates is because one of the small parties, the "Liberty Party," has recently split into two factions. The names of each party and candidate are listed below:</p>
<p>Party Name        Presidential Candidate    Vice-Presidential Candidate</p>
<p>Republican Party     Hoover               Curtis</p>
<p>Democratic Party     Roosevelt            Garner</p>
<p>Socialist Party      Thomas               Maurer</p>
<p>Communist (Workers') Party Foster           Ford (Black)</p>
<p>Socialist Labor Party  Renauci              Egan</p>
<p>Prohibition Party      Hoppe               Rugan</p>
<p>Farmer-Labor Party    Coxey              (No Candidate)</p>
<p>Liberty Party      Whiteharfer         Hemenway</p>
<p>Unemployed Party     Cox                Tistander</p>
<p>Although the US government is regarded as conservative and capitalist, and the majority of the American people also have this tendency, this does not mean that the American people do not have the right to vote freely. As mentioned above, there are nine political parties in the United States, and the American people can choose the president according to their own political views. Even if they elect the communist party members, Foster and Ford, as the American President and Vice President for the next four years, it is not impossible. In reality, the next president will be either Mr. Hoover or Mr. Roosevelt. However, due to the severe economic depression in the United States at present, the number of votes obtained by the Socialist Party this time may be much higher than its past history. The party's candidate, Thomas, recently predicted that the party's electoral power could quadruple this time, precisely because of the economic depression and the apparent inability of the two major parties to improve the situation. The chaos and unrest in the American political scene are probably unprecedented. The reasons for this are numerous and cannot be exhausted in a short statement. In summary, in addition to the usual economic and political disputes, there is the prohibition issue. The Republican and Democratic parties, in view of the apparent ineffectiveness of trying to enforce prohibition, have both expressed their intention to amend the prohibition law, and the Democratic Party seems to be "wetter" than the Republican Party. Another thing to know is that the Republican Party is greatly divided internally in this election. The liberal or progressive elements within the party have turned to the Democratic Party. The most prominent example is Senator Johnson of California, who has abandoned Hoover and will bring his state under the Democratic Party banner. In addition, the La Follette faction of Wisconsin, Senator Black of Iowa, and Senator Norris of Nebraska have all abandoned Hoover. However, Senator Borah of Idaho, although dissatisfied with Hoover's policies, recently declared that he is willing to vote for the Republican Party. As for the leaders of the American industrial world, who have always stood on the side of the Republican Party, they are also inconsistent in this year's election. Some important figures have switched to the Democratic Party. However, the automobile king Ford, who has always been a Democrat, has declared this time that he is willing to support the Republican Hoover. In peacetime, the number of Republicans voting has always exceeded the number of Democrats by six or seven million. However, this year, due to the economic depression, millions of people are unemployed, and tens of millions of people, including farmers, have lost money. They all believe that the responsibility for this lies with President Hoover and the Republican Party, so the number of votes obtained by the Republican Party will be greatly reduced. As for American citizens residing overseas, American law does not allow them to vote, so tens of millions of people residing in the Far East cannot express their choice in this election. However, although they do not have the right to vote, they are deeply interested, especially those who pay attention to American foreign policy.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 7th Dispatch: British public opinion is paying close attention to the US presidential election. What the general public sees is only the dispute between the prohibitionists and anti-prohibitionists. However, those with higher insight are concerned about three major issues due to the presidential election: (1) The war debt issue. This matter should now be initiated by the United States in order to be discussed. (2) The disarmament issue. Regarding this matter, if it only involves land armaments, the United Kingdom has no objection to any plan. If it involves the navy, then the United Kingdom's attitude is relatively difficult to deal with. (3) The tariff issue. The US tariff rules are the starting point for the British protectionist policy. Some people are quite worried about the British government's vigorous implementation of the protectionist system. If the United States can participate in the World Economic Conference and agree to reduce the protectionist policy and lower tariffs, then those in the United Kingdom who advocate the protectionist policy can also compromise. Some people even say that if the United States can do this, then the tariff barriers around the world may be lowered as a result.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th Dispatch: Presidential election betting is still ongoing. Those who buy Democratic Party votes are betting one to five or one to six. It is expected that the difference in betting money will increase to seven to one before voting begins tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Havas, New York, 8th Dispatch: After a fierce election competition, American voters elected a new president today. This election is mainly concerned with the economic downturn. Of the 47 million voters, 11 million are unemployed workers, accounting for about a quarter of the total, and will have a significant impact on the election results. Therefore, according to the speculation of most political observers, President Hoover's fate will depend on the voting in the five states of the Midwest and East: Missouri, Minnesota, Ohio, Indiana, and Iowa. The agricultural and industrial sectors of these states have felt the economic panic, enough to make the Republican Party encounter an unprecedented disaster. Although the presidential election is not directly voted on by the voters, but by the voters electing representatives to elect the president, the results of tomorrow's voting will reveal who the new president will be, because these elected representatives will vote according to the candidates designated by the voters. In the election of the President and Vice President, the number of representatives elected by each state is equal to the number of representatives of that state in the Senate and House of Representatives. According to this calculation, there are a total of 531 representatives in all states of the country. To win by a majority, at least 266 votes are needed to elect the head of state.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 8th Dispatch: The entire nation is paying close attention to the results of the US presidential election today. They will stay up all night waiting for news. Dance halls and other places that usually close at 3:00 AM will be specially extended to 5:00 AM to allow city residents to relax in them.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Plot to Bomb Hoover's Special Train Foiled <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, San Francisco, 8th Dispatch: The US presidential election will begin this morning. Republican President Hoover made his final speech in Salt Lake City yesterday and then rushed back to his hometown. However, late last night, there was another conspiracy to bomb a bridge that the special train was about to pass over. Fortunately, it was discovered in time, and the President's special train was spared from danger. Given the two previous conspiracies, the railroad company, together with the state police and the National Guard, closely guarded the route along which the special train passed. Security forces were stationed at every bridge, railroad curve, and other places vulnerable to sabotage. However, in a desolate area of Nevada, someone placed explosives under the railroad in the center of the bridge. After the President's special train departed from the Patriotic Coke Factory, the criminal went to secretly place the fuse, but was spotted by the bridge guard, who went forward to inquire. The criminal opened fire and resisted arrest, and the guard returned fire for a moment. The criminal then abandoned more than twenty fuses and fled. The guard did not have time to pursue him, and urgently tried to remove the bombs under the bridge. However, after the inspection, blood stains were everywhere along the way, and it is expected that the criminal must have been injured. It is expected that after a nationwide search, it will not be difficult to arrest him. It is said that this matter has not yet been reported to Hoover.</p>
<h3 id="e53">German Parliamentary Election Results: Papen Expresses Satisfaction <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Government Welcomes Cooperation from All Parties</p>
<p>Hitler Declares No Compromise</p>
<p>New Parliament Scheduled to Convene on December 12th</p>
<p>The Speakership Will Still Belong to the National Socialist Party</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 7th Dispatch: The Papen government claimed today that it was satisfied with the election results. The government has no reason to change its current policy. The government is prepared to welcome any party that is willing to cooperate with the government. The new parliament will be convened on December 12th. Political parties will engage in negotiations before the meeting. The next few weeks will be very quiet, as a political truce has now been declared, and all political meetings and demonstrations are not allowed. The Radical Strike Committee today announced the cessation of the transport strike, and it is expected that the entire transport business will be restored tomorrow.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 7th Dispatch: The Papen cabinet is very satisfied with the results of this election, as the decrease in the percentage of voters and the obvious decrease in the number of votes obtained by the National Socialist Party were both unexpected by Papen. However, there are several points that make Papen unable to feel at ease. First, Hitler declared that he would never compromise with Papen, or even said that he would treat Papen with force, which is only a personal matter. If Papen is excluded and a broad coalition cabinet of all parties is formed, then the Hitler party may not be unwilling to participate, and not only the Central Party, which has always advocated this matter, supports this kind of coalition, but even the National People's Party may not be unwilling to participate, and the National People's Party is indispensable when the right-wing cabinet forms a majority party in the parliament. Recently, editorials in the right-wing newspapers advocated the concentration of all parties. Now some people say that this concentration will be realized by the Minister of Defense. Economic figures, threatened by the extremism of the National Socialist Party and the communist tide, will also certainly promote the concentration of all parties.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 7th Dispatch: The leader of the National Socialist Party, Hitler, recently issued a declaration to his party members, saying, "The German government's attack on the rights of the people and the violence it has inflicted has now been stopped. The Papen government has completely failed. Papen's party members, namely the National People's Party and its allies, only have one-tenth of the power in the parliament. We must continue to resist this force and eliminate it. We will never have any reconciliation or compromise with these people." Finally, Hitler said that he would attack this force with even greater publicity than before.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 7th Dispatch: In the Sunday election, General Li Zimmern of the National Socialist Party was elected. He is the oldest member of the House of Representatives, seven years older than Madame Chai Qing of the Communist Party. Therefore, when the new House of Representatives opens, he will be the interim chairman.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Hindenburg Receives Papen <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 7th Dispatch: President Hindenburg received Prime Minister Papen this afternoon to discuss the impact of the general election on the political situation. Although there was no announcement or publication afterwards, according to those familiar with the political content, the President and the Prime Minister did agree that further efforts will be made regarding the steps of the political parties of the coalition government faction. The attitude of these right-wing parties, such as the Catholic Central Party and the Bavarian People's Party, seems to have eased somewhat compared to before the election. Therefore, Papen will start negotiations with these parties in the coming days, and will also have the same discussions with the National Socialist Party.</p>

<p>Threat From the Far East Has Not Gone Away</p>
<p>Armed Forces Maintain Peace</p>
<p>Statement by the Army Commander on the Anniversary of the Revolution</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 7th Dispatch: Today, the entire Soviet Union celebrated the 13th anniversary of the revolution, which was quite lively. A solemn gathering was held last night in the Great Opera House here. Government leaders Stalin, Kalinin, and Voroshilov all attended. Kalinin spoke about the success of Soviet construction, pointing out that the Five-Year Plan has been completed in four years, and the Soviet Union has become an industrial and agricultural country that applies the most modern technology. Regarding international affairs, Kalinin declared that the Soviet Union has always adhered to a policy of peace. Although the British government recently decided to abolish the Anglo-Russian trade agreement in an attempt to harm the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom itself will also suffer losses. Kalinin pointed out the success of the Soviet Union's peace policy, saying that a majority of non-aggression treaties have been signed, and a similar treaty is expected to be signed with France soon. It was also heard that regarding the Far East, Kalinin said that although the current situation has improved, the threat to the Soviet Union has not completely disappeared, and the Soviet Union should adhere to its policy and do its best to achieve peace.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 7th Dispatch: Today, the Military Revolutionary Committee issued a statement signed by Voroshilov, declaring that the Soviet army will devote its efforts to the construction of socialism and does not want war. It is said that "For fifteen years, we have always been seeking peace. We know that the stronger the Red Army, the less dare the enemy to invade the borders of the Soviet Union, and the more stable our peace policy will be." Finally, it said that the Red Army will always maintain its policy of maintaining peace and will not allow any aggressors to step into its borders.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Parade Held in Red Square <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 7th Dispatch: Today is the 15th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The marchers in Moscow's Red Square included the entire garrison of Moscow, the entire workers' self-defense corps of the Red Army, etc. The workers' teams passing through the square numbered over a million. Therefore, the parade lasted from the afternoon until late at night and was not yet over. Soviet government figures and representatives from various countries had seats on Lenin's tomb, and there was a special platform for the delegation members of various countries to visit. When each group marched, they all had flags in their hands, with slogans written on them, the most important of which were "A new world war is imminent" and "The decline of capitalism," etc. This year's 15th anniversary of the revolution, apart from the slightly larger number of people joining the parade than before, everything else was the same as before. Furthermore, the most popular event today was the pay raise for naval and military personnel. This pay raise almost doubled in the navy, and some say this move is actually a prelude to a general wage increase for workers.</p>

<p>Hua Lian News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: Negotiations on the puppet state's borrowing of 30 million yuan from Japan have had hopeful results. This loan was borrowed in the name of the puppet organization, but in reality, the Japanese military and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs completely let them allocate construction. The Soviet Union is paying close attention to this loan. Recently, there have been rumors from the Japanese side that the Soviet Union will prepare to recognize the puppet state, but the facts are completely opposite.</p>

<p>There are Actually Proposals to Levy Special Taxes on Foreigners</p>
<p>Fear of Causing Protests From the US Government</p>
<p>National News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: According to unofficial news here, Japan's anti-American propaganda has reached a degree that may cause the US envoy to protest again to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Although the US Embassy does not believe that the anti-American activities of the Japanese extreme nationalists can gain the participation of a majority of the people, it is certainly not happy to see anti-American acts in their newspapers and speeches by celebrities. The US ambassador, Grover, will not lightly go to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs until he encounters a clear case for protest. What has recently made the Americans even more unhappy and considered the foolish attitude of the Japanese nationalists is the editorial in the National News, which advocated levying special taxes on foreigners, on the grounds that after Japan abandoned the gold standard, the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against foreign currencies plummeted, and special taxes can be levied on foreigners. Although this theory of the newspaper is aimed at foreigners in general, its wording specifically compares Japanese yen with US dollars, so the Americans believe that its intention is specifically directed at American expatriates and is a kind of anti-American propaganda.</p>

<p>And Releases Air of Russia Not Attending</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: Previously, there were rumors that the League of Nations advocated inviting representatives from the United States and Russia to attend the Council with the qualifications of observers. According to a telegram from the Japanese delegation in Geneva to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, Secretary-General Drummond has unofficially denied this rumor to Representative Nagaoka. The Japanese government also stated that it absolutely opposes the Council inviting Russian representatives. However, according to news arriving in Geneva, the Soviet Russian government does not want to participate. If it receives an invitation from the Council, it will politely decline. According to another saying, the United States and Russia will be invited by the Committee of Nineteen. In short, the Japanese government is determined to take an absolutely opposed attitude towards the substantial participation of US and Russian representatives in the discussion of the Manchurian issue.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Concedes to the Military in Revival Demands</p>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency, Tokyo, 8th Dispatch: Since Japan sent troops to invade our Northeast, military spending has increased daily, and the economic community is feeling more and more depressed. According to news from the Japanese Ministry of Finance, due to the large drop in exchange rates, the burden of foreign debt has doubled. It is heard that by the end of 1933, the total amount of Japan's national debt will exceed 10 billion yen, and the interest alone will require 5 million yen. The content is as follows: (1) The existing national debt at the end of September 1932 was 6.308 billion yen (unit: million yen). (2) The amount of national debt to be issued by the end of March 1933 was 614. (3) The amount of public debt to be delivered was 614. (4) The amount of credit from the government from the Bank of Japan and the postal savings department was 658. (5) The amount of public debt planned to be issued in fiscal year 1933 is approximately 1,000. (6) The amount of foreign debt burden increased due to the drop in foreign exchange rates is approximately 1,400, totaling 10.041.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 7th Dispatch: Foreign Secretary Simon said in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Conservative Party member Miller regarding the special court in the Shanghai International Settlement that a notice to terminate this agreement has not been issued, and a suitable plan to remedy existing shortcomings is currently under consideration. The British Chargé d'Affaires in China has discussed this matter with the Chinese authorities. Miller said that if we want to achieve genuine improvement, we should issue a notice. He meant that if a notice is issued, the government should pay attention to the necessary reforms and have full consultation with the Shanghai Municipal Council. If necessary, any relevant organizations should participate in the consideration. The Foreign Secretary replied that he would be happy to consider his proposal at length.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Great Debate on Unemployment Relief <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Mai Xiang Advocates Developing Markets</p>
<p>So That the Unemployed Have Work to Do</p>
<p>Reuters, London, July 7th: The House of Commons plans to spend three days debating the unemployment problem. All parties will concentrate their efforts on devising remedies. Prime Minister MacDonald expressed his views in the House of Commons today, urging members to work together to promote commercial prosperity so that the whole country needs labor. He replied that Britain's real difficulty lies in being part of a world battered by the great economic turmoil. Therefore, unless the turmoil has passed, unless world commercial markets are active, and world production is adjusted, the unemployment problem, which is fundamentally an international problem, will persist. The Prime Minister also said that he has great trust and hope in the International Economic Conference. There is little hope for robust commerce unless a sound method of exchanging goods is agreed upon. Unless this is achieved, no European country can return to prosperity. The Prime Minister continued that he felt that land was more important than ever in supporting unemployment programs. The government is now planning ways to subsidize agriculture. Agriculture should be able to save itself through current tax laws. Currently, no industries have received preferential treatment, so it is not appropriate to give this treatment exclusively to agriculture. The Prime Minister does not support relief efforts but advocates providing the unemployed with work so that they can be secure in their jobs. He also said that the government is consulting with expert advisors on ways to increase British work efficiency and open up British goods markets. Finally, he said that public and private organizations should generously assist those in need to overcome the current economic difficulties. Labor Party Greenhu also claimed that restoring trade depends on consolidating prices and reorganizing basic industries. Subsequent speakers expressed that the opinions of the Conservative Party were also not entirely the same. Some Conservatives advocated giving preferential treatment to agriculture. Liberal Party Lloyd George advocated the development of a small landholder system because it uses more labor. George said that not a single British laborer owns land. The development of a small landholder system would only require £200 million, while the current subsidy system costs £400 million. According to his calculations, agriculture and its subsidiary industries can accommodate at least one million workers. Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries Elliot said that meat importers have agreed to reduce the supply of mutton by 20% and the supply of frozen beef by 10% for several weeks. If prices do not rise during the period, frozen beef will be reduced by another 10%. Representatives from Australia and New Zealand are very willing to cooperate and have telegraphed their governments. It is expected that mutton imports will decrease by one-tenth in the next two weeks, and the British livestock industry should improve. The debate is scheduled to end tomorrow.</p>

<p>Hungarian Prime Minister to Visit Rome</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, July 8th: U.S. Representative Davis began meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today. It is expected that the two men's talks will last for several days. The diplomatic and political circles in the Italian capital attach great importance to this because Mr. Davis has recently had long talks with the Prime Ministers of Britain and France. It is expected that his purpose is to mediate on the issue of disarmament, hoping to reach an understanding between several strong countries.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Hungarian Capital, July 8th: The Hungarian Prime Minister departed for Rome today to formally visit Mussolini. Both Italian and Hungarian newspapers attach great importance to this trip. According to Hungarian newspapers, the close cooperation between the Italian and Hungarian governments on France's new security and disarmament plan will be one of the matters discussed by the two leaders. Related to this is the issue of the power of Italy and France in the Balkan states and the separated independent states. Furthermore, whether Hungary's policy towards Russia should change after the establishment of the non-aggression treaty between Poland and Russia is also expected to be discussed by the two leaders.</p>

<p>Black Child Beaten White Child and Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Various Organizations Protested and the Case Was Returned for Retrial</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, July 7th: Today, the U.S. Supreme Court rescued seven black children from the gallows, granting them a retrial. After the seven black children were accused of beating two white girls and sentenced to death by the local court of Elbama, the state's highest court upheld the original verdict three times. It was not until the appeal to the Federal Supreme Court that a retrial was granted on the grounds that the defense lawyer was ineffective. According to this case, due to racial hatred in Alabama and the joint efforts of various free and radical groups in the northern United States to seek justice for the black people, it has attracted national attention and has been the focus of debate in various circles. As for the details of the case, according to the facts stated by the defendant's lawyer, in March of last year, there were seven white boys, two girls, and nine black children riding in a freight car.</p>
<p>The child was pushed under the car, and someone telegraphed the authorities to drive all the black people out of the car. However, the telegram did not mention the girls, only that the white children and black children were fighting each other. After the tax police boarded the car and took away the black children, it was reported that the girls were injured. According to the report of the two girls, each was beaten by six black children.</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, July 7th: Previously, seven young black men were sentenced to death by the American court for beating two white women and raping them in a train. The case was sensational throughout the United States and alarmed foreign countries. The mother of one of the black men had traveled throughout Europe to appeal for her son, so Europeans have heard even more about this case. Recently, the U.S. Supreme Court has revoked the original sentence of death for the seven black men. Before the Supreme Court announced the verdict, demonstrations were held, and clashes broke out with the police, causing chaos. One police officer was injured, and thirteen demonstrators were arrested.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, July 7th: As a result of French Prime Minister Herriot's speech in Doros, the Radical Socialist Party unanimously expressed its trust in Mr. Herriot. Therefore, the position of the Herriot cabinet has indeed been consolidated. This will certainly have a great impact on French diplomacy. When Mr. Herriot returned to the capital this morning, he had the air of a victorious warrior returning in triumph. This can be seen in the newspapers. Even newspapers that have always opposed Mr. Herriot, such as the People's Daily, call Mr. Herriot the central soul of the Radical Socialist Party. And Mr. Herriot's party newspapers have even more praise for Mr. Herriot.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Iron Evidence of the Human Body Emitting Electrical Force <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>New Invention of Human Body Electrical Photography</p>
<p>The Value of Electric Ginseng Paste "Wuliangshou"</p>
<p>Dr. Marina Ci, a member of the Italian National Academy of Sciences, is a well-known scientist and is respected as the founder of Futurism. Recently, Mr. Ma reported a major biological discovery at a meeting of the Science Department of the Italian National Academy of Sciences, that is, Mr. Ma and Dr. Keli Mao Naxi can photograph the life force (electricity) emitted by the human body. According to Mr. Ma's theory, the result of this great new invention may soon be able to seek the public rules of human vitality, and it is not known whether it will obtain the elements of physiological mathematics in biology. According to this experimental report, it is completely the same as the study of supplementing electrical energy to the human body with the new drug "Wuliangshou" invented and created by Shanghai Foci Pharmaceutical Factory. Since the human body often emits electrical energy, it must also often supplement electrical energy to the body. Applying electric ginseng paste "Wuliangshou" to people for internal use can indeed supplement electrical energy to the body, so as to improve health and prevent diseases. It is indeed an unprecedented electrical tonic in ancient and modern times, both Chinese and Western.</p>
<p>If you use a microscope to examine the bodies of the elderly, you will find that most cells are in a state of atrophy, or swollen into granular lesions, keratinized, glassy, ​​and other changes, and finally become vacuoles, thus disappearing the nucleus and dying. The inherent driving force of the human body's cells for life function is the phenomenon of electrical action. The real reason for aging and death is the gradual decrease in the amount of electricity generated in the body. So, why does the amount of electricity generated in the body gradually decrease? The human body is like a storage battery, and the electrolytic atom decomposition of the storage battery is very strong when it is newly made, so it generates strong electricity. After a certain period of time, the electrolytic atoms are completely combined into a chemically stable compound and cannot generate electricity. Therefore, the life of the battery must be proportional to the time for which the chemical reaction of the electrolyte and solution continues. The more electricity is used and the longer the electricity is used, the amount of electricity in the battery will gradually decrease, which is inversely proportional to the amount of electricity used and the time electricity is used. The human body is no different from this storage battery. Although it is supplemented with electricity generators from the nutrients taken, the difference between the amount of electricity input and the amount of electricity consumed is different. Therefore, the amount of electricity generated in the body gradually decreases, which causes the phenomenon of illness and old age. The various cells in the human body are batteries that generate electricity. The human brain is a storage battery that stores electricity. The blood is a conductor that supplies electricity-generating substances to the cells. Therefore, if you want to maintain the amount of electricity in the body, you must wait for (1) power generation (2) electricity storage (3) the complete fulfillment of the three conditions for the supply of electricity-generating substances before it can be completed. If there is a special method to keep the activity of electrons going forever, then our bodies can be permanently free from aging and gain immortality. The speed of modern scientific progress is rapid, with a momentum of thousands of miles a day. Those that we once considered to be created by divine power can now be manufactured artificially. The big problem of longevity and anti-aging that we most desire has also begun to see a solution with the development of electrical science, colloid chemistry, and medicine. The invention of this charging tonic "Wuliangshou" is also the same.</p>
<p>Each tablet of electric ginseng paste "Wuliangshou" contains the electrical energy required by the human body, which is a photosensitive generator that is the driving force of life. If you apply this electric ginseng paste "Wuliangshou" particles that store photocurrents to the human body by internal use, it will release the stored current when the solid colloid changes to liquid, and circulate through the blood to transfer it to the various cells of the human body. Therefore, it can provide us with living electrons that are the driving force of life, increase the proliferation and regeneration power of each cell, and extend it to an unlimited period.</p>
<p>"Wuliangshou" specializes in treating weakness of qi and blood in men and women, premature aging, aging, decreased vision, weakened brainpower, decreased energy, impotence, kidney deficiency, spermatorrhea, neurasthenia, incomplete development, arteriosclerosis, premature aging of the face, back pain, various wasting diseases, depression, amnesia, insomnia, and all functional nervous system diseases, with incredible magical effects.</p>
<p>Sen was invited to participate, and Luo Zezhou and Li Qixiang also heard about it. The situation in Taiwan was broken, and Liu Xiang was isolated. The speed of the change is really only seen, but there are also clues in it. Deng Tian and the provincial Liu originally had an inseparable relationship. Luo and Li also only looked to Deng's lead. This alliance with Liu Xiang was only used to threaten Liu Wenhui and create opportunities for themselves. They did not love Liu Xiang in the first place. Once the goal was achieved, the attitude could be changed. We had already anticipated this when the war broke out. The content of the agreement was previously kept secret, but now it has been reflected in the facts. Roughly, Liu Wenhui ceded more than a dozen counties to Deng, Tian, ​​Yang, Luo, Li, and others for defense. Deng, Tian, ​​Yang, Luo, Li, and others also allocated them at the Jianyang meeting. The areas received by Deng's department were Wenjiang, Chongqingzhou, Huayang, Jianzhou, Lezhi, Tongnan, Anyue, and other seven counties. The areas received by Tian's department were Jintang, Xindu, Pengle, Chengdu, and other four counties. The areas received by Yang, Luo, Li, and other departments were Shunqing, Suining, Pengxi, and other three counties. They have now been completed and received. Deng, Tian, ​​Yang, Luo, Li, and other five generals telegraphed Liu Xiang to quickly withdraw the troops attacking Luzhou, open Kuiwan, and realize peace. Liu Wenhui also telegraphed the whole country and put forward three governance plans for Sichuan: 1. All military and political powers should be returned to the central government for direct handling. 2. Implement the streamlining plan, and each army should be directly under the central government. 3. The chairman of the provincial government should have a resolution from the central government to follow. In the future, the central government should issue a clear order to reorganize the provincial government. This telegram was sent on the 3rd. Deng, Tian, ​​Yang, Luo, and Li generals are preparing to send a telegram in response. Liu Xiang's department regards itself as the leader of the alliance and wants to use the power of the crowd to control the provincial Liu. They thought it was a sure-win plan. When Liu Dengtian was brewing cooperation, he still wanted to take advantage of the fact that the time was not ripe to attack Lujiang. Now that the situation is getting worse day by day, it seems that he has turned back in despair. Although the troops in front are still attacking, they are not as fierce as before. Liu himself has returned to Chongqing from the front line. In this war, Liu Wenhui did not move or make a sound and retreated in the face of difficulties. It seems that he knows the meaning of controlling the situation with quietness. Liu Xiang is inevitably close to impetuousness. With the strength of the army, navy, and air force, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in war expenses, the result is only for Deng, Tian, ​​Yang, Luo, Li, and others to expand their territory and increase their strength, and arouse the demand for opening Kuiwan. He wants to advance but cannot, and he wants to retreat but cannot. In the quiet night, he should regret his miscalculation. At this time, when a new situation is unfolding and a peaceful solution is suddenly hoped for, the central committee member Zhang Qun, who bears this mission, has been in Hankou for days, and Liu Xiang's representative Qiu Jia, Liu Wenhui's representative Wu Jinhang, Deng Xihou's representative Cao Chichang, Tian Songyao's representative Yang Yashi Tang, Liu Cunhou's representative Huang Yawei, and the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee Xu Zhongqi, etc., discussed the plan. It was decided that the representatives would telegraph the commanders of each army to implement a ceasefire before the 21st of this month and await peaceful handling. Zhang will also formulate another plan based on the previous order of the national government and the opinions of the representatives and submit it to Jiang for review. The representatives urged Zhang to go to Sichuan, and Zhang has agreed. After visiting Jiang, he will determine the date of departure. The representatives will also accompany him. However, Zhang only wants to act as a mediator in a private capacity and does not have any coercive power over the limited ceasefire. Therefore, whether there will be satisfactory results depends on whether the generals are sincerely repentant. (November 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Tang Juwu's Department Plans Three-Way Counter-Offensive <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Wang Fengge to Be the Commander of the Northern Route, Xu Dasan to Be the Commander of the Southern Route</p>
<p>Tang Will Be the Commander of the Central Route and Will Attack Tonghua with Li Chunrun</p>
<p>｜War Situation Recently Reported by Luan Fazhang, Commander of the Anti-Japanese Army｜</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Peiping: A source received a report yesterday from Wang Xiaowen, chairman of the Liaoning Eastern Border National Salvation Association, Tonghua North, Liuhe County, issued on the 1st of this month, stating that after the Japanese army launched a general offensive against our Self-Defense Army on the 11th of last month, it attacked in three routes. Our army also met the attack from four sides. Li Chunrun, stationed in Xingjing County, served as the commander-in-chief of the western route, guarding the Fushun Qingyuan defense line. Wang Fengge's department, stationed in Liuhe, served as the commander-in-chief of the northern route, guarding the Shanchengzhen and Panhai Road lines. Tang Juwu personally led his subordinates to guard the upper and lower reaches of Tonghua South, Ji'an Huanren, and the Yalu River. Xu Dasan guarded the area around Songshuzhen, north of Linjiang County, in the upper reaches of the Yalu River. When the Japanese army's general offensive began, the Western Route Army was the first to respond. In the Battle of Shangxiahe, more than 500 Japanese soldiers collapsed one after another. Our army finally held its original defense. From the 15th, the Japanese army on the north and south routes responded to each other and violently rushed into the northern route army, Wang Fengge's department, with 60,000 troops, fought bravely and fought in more than a dozen battles. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Whenever there was hand-to-hand combat, our Broadsword Team charged into battle, killing countless enemies. The Japanese army was terrified of them. Therefore, as of now, Wang's department still holds its original defense. The Japanese army, which attacked from the border of the southern route of Korea, combined infantry and air force, plus cavalry and artillery, and had a fierce momentum. Our General Commander Tang (Juwu) personally led his subordinates and fought bravely. However, due to the fierce Japanese artillery fire, the cities of Tonghua and Huanren counties have been bombed by Japanese aircraft for several days in a row, and the people have suffered heavy losses. Tang believes that the Japanese army has sophisticated equipment and that it is not easy to fight on the plains. In order to cherish the lives of the people, he ordered the various departments of the southern route to withdraw from the cities of Huanren and Tonghua on the 22nd, and withdrew along the Tonghua Northeast Ermi Xiaoxicha area to the mountains and forests of Jinchuan, Fusong, Changbai, and Antu. The eastern route, Xu Dasan, withdrew from the city of Linjiang County and guarded the area around the Mosquito Gully Ridge and Songshuzhen. This Japanese army's general offensive did not make contact with the eastern route, so it still holds its original defense. At present, the defense line is that Wang Fengge's department is still in its original defense on the northern route, Li Chunrun's department is still on the border of Xingjing, Qingyuan, and Fushun, and another department has gone south to join forces with Deng Tiemei to attack Fenghuangcheng. The headquarters and the direct troops of General Commander Tang are now concentrated in Jinchuan, Mengjiang, Anchang, Changbai, and Fusong counties. Tang convened a military conference in Jinchuan on the 27th of last month, and senior officers of each army rushed to attend. It was decided to launch a counter-offensive after the military deployment was completed. It is planned to attack in three routes. Wang Fengge is still in charge of the northern route and will advance along the Shenhai Road. Xu Dasan is in charge of the southern route and will attack Linjiang and the Korean border from the Mosquito Gully Ridge in Fusong County. Tang Juwu is in charge of the central route and will go out of Jinchuan to coordinate with Li Chunrun's department in Xingjing County to attack Tonghua from the east and west. The headquarters and the National Salvation Association are now located in Mengjiang Bonai and will be moved to Fusong within a few days for command.</p>
<p>Luan Fazhang, Commander of the 5th Route of the Northeastern People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, now occupies Qingyuan, Yitong, Dongfeng, and other places. The headquarters is divided into twelve departments: Staff, Deputy Officer, Manager, Ordnance, Veterinarian, Communication, Intelligence, Secretary, Military Law, Military Doctor, Diplomacy, and Transportation. It also has four committees: Military Commission, Finance Commission, Political Commission, and Local Committee. It governs a total of two armies, six infantry brigades, two cavalry brigades, a pistol guard team, a guard regiment, and a broadsword team, with approximately 15,000 people. Luan's war report arrived in Peiping yesterday, reporting on the recent combat situation. The original text is as follows: "Our 1st Army attacked Dongfeng on September 3rd and came into contact with the puppet state army and police. I personally directed the front line and fought bloody battles for three days, and finally conquered Dongfeng. On the 17th, the 1st and 2nd brigades of the 1st Army, and a cavalry brigade, attacked Qingyuan, destroyed the Shenhai Road, occupied it for one day and night, and then withdrew. On the 29th, the 6th Brigade of the 29th Army and the 3rd Brigade of the 1st Army, and a cavalry brigade, attacked the Eight Trees area in the Kaiyuan border area, killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers, obtaining 23 rifles, and burning down the Japanese consulate. On October 9th, the 4th and 5th brigades of the 2nd Army fought with more than 500 Japanese soldiers in Egou, on the border of Xifeng. The Japanese army was surrounded by us and fought fiercely for five hours, killing 90 Japanese soldiers, obtaining 73 rifles, 2 machine guns, a submachine gun, and two boxes of bullets. The war situation will continue to be reported later. Luan Fazhang, Commander of the 5th Route of the Northeastern People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, bows."</p>

Local authorities and people's organizations in each location set off firecrackers to warmly welcome them. They did not disembark at any point along the way. They finally arrived at Nanyue Station at 6:50 PM that afternoon. Hengshan County Magistrate Chen Te and Hengyang County Magistrate Zhang Hanyi led personnel from various government agencies and public organizations, as well as military units, in a welcoming line. Chiang, He, and other personnel disembarked amidst the cheers of the crowd and switched to sedan chairs to proceed to Zhusheng Temple for rest. That evening, Chiang, He, and other dignitaries stayed at the Sacred Scripture School, while their entourages stayed at Zhusheng Temple. The following morning (the 3rd) at 7:00 AM, Chiang, He, and others went to Zhusheng Temple in Nanyue to hold a solemn Mount Worship ceremony. The ceremony was entirely modeled after the Confucian ritual, with all formalities observed. A Mount Worship address was also read aloud, stating, "Only God holds power, guarding this southern land. Emperor Shun's southern tour marked the flourishing of democracy. The world is for all, and the great path is open. Over four thousand years, the Premier continued the light. I, Zhongzheng, though lacking in talent, bear the burden of the Central Government. Respectfully, together with my colleagues, I tour Hunan. With pure sincerity, I visit the mountain and offer fragrant sacrifices. May the clouds open across the land, and the nation be peaceful and prosperous."</p>
<p>Observers said that this was an unprecedented grand event since the founding of the Republic of China. After the worship, they began touring the mountain, guided by Wang Hanchuan, the director of the Hengyue Administration Bureau. At that time, Chiang and his wife suddenly felt unwell from the cold and the strong mountain winds, so they could not go along. They stayed at the Sacred Scripture School to rest, with Miss He Mei, the daughter of He Jian, staying at the school to accompany them. The remaining Chiang, He, and others ascended the mountain in fifty-five sedan chairs to visit scenic spots such as Nanyue Temple, Fuyan Temple, Nantai Temple, Zhurong Peak, Jinjilin Bridge, Water Curtain Cave, and She Shen Rock. Wang Hanchuan provided explanations about the history and scenery of each location at all times. Monks from various temples lined the sides of the road, greeting them with cupped hands, and the crowds of onlookers were even more enthusiastic. Chiang was in high spirits.</p>
<p>Photographs were taken at each scenic spot visited, and sixteen pine and cypress trees were planted by the temple gate on the mountaintop by Chiang, He Jian, Liu Jianxu, Liu Yinggu, Wang Dongyuan, Li Jue, Chen Guangzhong, and others, with instructions to the monks to take good care of them as a memento. At noon, they had lunch at Shangfeng Temple. After lunch, they toured Laoshan until 7:00 PM in the evening, having visited all the scenic spots on the mountain. That evening, they originally intended to stay overnight at Zhurifeng in order to watch the sunrise the next day at dawn. However, since the sunrise could only be seen in the eighth month of the lunar calendar, and the time had passed, they all went down the mountain by sedan chair and stayed at the Sacred Scripture School again. On this day, there was an unusual event: the clouds on Mount Heng parted. Mount Heng is the premier scenic spot in the south. From its base to its summit, it is over thirty li high, with seventy-two peaks. Beyond the Halfway Pavilion, it is usually enveloped in mist and clouds, with the scenery obscured. The mountaintop never has a clear day throughout the year. It is said that when Tang Dynasty scholar Han Yu (Changli) and Qing Dynasty Grand Coordinator Wu Rongguang visited, the clouds and mist parted, a tale that has been passed down to this day and recorded in the Nanyue Zhi. Qing Dynasty Zhao Gongyi (Shenqiao) once wanted to see the scenery, but the clouds did not part, so he wrote a couplet to express his disappointment: "Over a thousand years ago, when the Minister of Works toured, who could continue the Poet Sage's resonance? Looking at the seventy-two peaks, since Duke Wen's departure, the mountain clouds have not lightly parted." This story is well known to the people of Hunan. This time, when Chiang visited, the weather was clear and bright, the clouds parted, and the scenery was fully visible. Furthermore, after descending the mountain, it rained that very evening. The general consensus was that this was not only a spectacle but also a truly extraordinary event. After descending the mountain, Chiang, because the Lion Rock in the mountains was a famous scenic spot with many visitors, specially donated 1,000 yuan to Wang Hanchuan to build a stone pavilion as a place for visitors to rest. He also donated 1,000 yuan to Wang Hanchuan to be distributed to the temples on the mountain as a reward. Wang Hanchuan also presented Chiang with a copy of the Nanyue Zhi, a rubbing of the Five Hundred Arhats, and half a catty of Mount Heng wild tea. With this, the mountain tour was complete. Chiang and others had originally planned to return to the provincial capital by car on the 4th, but officials and gentry from Hengshan and Hengyang counties earnestly requested him to inspect the counties. Chiang then took a car with He Jian and others from Nanyue to Hengshan County on the 4th at 11:00 AM for an inspection. It was decided that they would go to Hengyang for inspection on the 5th and review the 15th Division of Wang Dongyuan's troops, preparing to return to the provincial capital on the 6th. Chen Cheng, Li Zonghuang, and others who had traveled to the mountains returned to the provincial capital by car on the 4th and then took an express train to Hankou at 4:00 PM. (November 5th)</p>

<p>▲Urging the Four Counties of Shang, Song, and South to Convene a Meeting</p>
<p>▲Each County Will Begin Reorganization After Land Survey</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Interior previously promulgated an outline for the reorganization of county administrative regions, which the Jiangsu Provincial Government instructed the Civil Affairs Department to forward to the counties for implementation. Subsequently, Fengxian County reported that Taiping and other townships under the jurisdiction of Nanhui County, and Yexie and other towns under the jurisdiction of Songjiang County, were intertwined with the county, making administrative facilities inconvenient. They proposed to annex them for the purpose of reorganization. Nanhui also submitted a request to annex Chenhang Township under the jurisdiction of Shanghai County for the same reason, while strongly objecting to Fengxian's request. At the same time, Songjiang County also strongly opposed the annexation of its jurisdictions. As a result, this case was endlessly contested and involved the reorganization of the administrative regions of the four counties. They were then separately ordered to convene a meeting of the four counties in accordance with Article 6 of the outline to negotiate a reorganization plan for submission and transfer for approval. However, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it was suspended. It is now being urged to proceed. After it is received, it will be reviewed and reported. Although other county administrative regions have not been reported, it is still difficult to avoid the situation of irregular boundaries. The province is now carrying out land surveys. Actively underway, it is planned to start reorganization after the completion of land measurement and the drawing of detailed maps throughout the province.</p>

<p>Robbery at Maojia Bridge, Fengjing: Fengjing has always been a bandit-ridden area. Recently, the paddy fields have just matured, and bandits in the four villages are again planning to make trouble, being very active at the junction of Qingpu and Songjiang. At Maojia Bridge, Sixty-fourth Ward, the house of Yu Guiqing was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits on the evening of the 4th. Each of them had painted faces and carried various types of guns. They broke into the house and first went to Yu Yu'a'lai's room, searching and looting at will, and dragged A'lai off the bed, intending to kidnap him. A'lai escaped naked. His father, Guiqing, heard that the bandits were trying to kidnap his beloved son. Without regard for his own safety, he ran outside and shouted for the capture of the bandits. Immediately, the neighbors gathered and rang gongs to sound the alarm. The bandits fled in panic, firing a shot as they left, wounding Yu Guiqing's leg. The bullet had pierced through. Fortunately, his life was not in danger.</p>

<p>Gambler Drowns While Escaping: At Wu Jing Village, about two li from Zhengyi Town in the county, a gambling gathering took place at Wang Xiaoniang's house on the evening of the 6th. This was detected by Wei Xiaohong, the chief of the local public security sub-bureau, who immediately dispatched police to arrest them. Five gamblers were captured and taken to the bureau. On the way, two of them escaped. On the morning of the 7th, a corpse was suddenly found in the river there. It was Wang Lazi, one of the gamblers who had been arrested the night before. Upon hearing this, the villagers were outraged and went to the public security sub-bureau in a group to argue. The order was greatly disturbed. Later, the district office sent personnel to mediate and disperse them.

<p>Dispute Over Road Repairs on the Xicheng Road: The road surface on the northern section of the Xicheng Highway has been severely damaged, making travel difficult. After repeated disputes, the Xicheng Automobile Company raised 36,000 yuan to repair it and pave it with stone slabs. Work began last month and is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year. A road toll collection point has been established to collect fees. During this road repair period, local business cars in Wuxi are not allowed to pass. However, various car companies requested the Jiangyin County Government to reverse its decision, as it affects their business. County Magistrate Ma approved the request, but on the 5th, the Jiangyin County Government suddenly ordered them to stop driving or the cars would be detained. The car owners panicked after receiving the order and went to Jiangyin to petition, stating that if they were hindering the work, they would rather stop driving together with the large car company. The authorities had no choice but to allow them to drive, but with restrictions. The cars resumed normal operation yesterday.</p>
<p>Jiangsu Province Regulates Food Distribution Regionally: The Jiangsu Province food regulation issue was initiated by the Shanghai Municipal Local Association. Meetings were held in Shanghai, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang, deciding that relevant local governments should organize the Jiangsu-Shanghai Food Regulation Association. Regarding the opening of the rice ban in Jiangsu Province, the initial circulation of rice and the prohibition of government and police interference, a telegram has already been sent to the Provincial Government, and the Ministry of Finance and Industry has been instructed to handle it as soon as possible. The representatives petitioned Finance Minister Song, who expressed three points: (1) Free circulation within the country can be followed. (2) Tax collection on imported foreign rice will be implemented after explaining the misunderstanding to the authorities in Guangdong via telegram. (3) The loan of American wheat and the tax on imported goods should still be considered, as the government borrowed only 400,000 tons this year, while the amount of commercial loans in previous years was over 700,000 or 800,000 tons. This year's agricultural products, including wheat, are not surplus, so there seems to be no impact. Afterwards, the association drafted implementation measures. The committee also decided on the establishment of public warehouses. The third group includes nine counties: Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, Wujiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Tianyin, Yixing, and Liyang, and it was decided that the chambers of commerce of Wuxian and Wuxi will convene a meeting to discuss together. Wuxi has already scheduled to invite the chambers of commerce and representatives of local relevant organizations from Wujin, Jiangyin, Yixing, and Liyang on the afternoon of the 11th to hold a meeting in Wuxi to discuss the plan. It is also reported that when representatives from each county met in Shanghai, the banking community agreed to provide practical assistance, as it concerns the relief of rural areas. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in Wuxi have agreed to lend 200,000 yuan (including Jiangyin) to be handled by the Wuxi Farmers Bank, and the interest rates will be handled in accordance with the Farmers Bank's agricultural lending regulations. Regarding the foreign rice currently stored in Shanghai, there are still 1.4 million piculs. As Tianjin and Guangdong are currently short of rice, Minister Song has telegraphed the financial bureaus of Tianjin and Guangdong to investigate and prepare to transport it by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships to facilitate circulation.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Ministry of Education's Interpretation of the Regulations on Pension and Bereavement Payments for Vocational Education Personnel <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>According to Wu Zefan, the principal of Fuzhou Normal School, Article 16 of the Regulations on Pension and Bereavement Payments for Vocational Education Personnel states that if a person receiving a pension dies before two years, half of the bereavement payment stipulated in Article 8 shall be paid. Furthermore, Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Regulations on Pension and Bereavement Payments states that the pension for vocational education personnel shall be issued by the competent educational administrative agency in four installments in March, June, September, and December. If a vocational education staff applies for retirement in accordance with the regulations and is approved to receive a pension, but dies before the period of issuance, the person has not actually received the benefit of the pension. Can the application for bereavement payment be handled separately, like the situation of vocational education personnel in service and those receiving pensions under Article 16? Also, if a vocational education staff applies for retirement and is approved by the school to receive a pension and a certificate is issued, but the paperwork is delayed, and the person dies before receiving the pension certificate, at the time of death, the person and their family believe they are still in service, but they have been approved to retire. Can the bereavement payment be handled as if they were vocational education personnel in service? The Ministry of Education's interpretation is as follows: If a vocational education staff in a school applies for retirement in accordance with the regulations and is approved to receive a pension, but dies before the period of issuance, or is approved to receive a pension certificate but dies because the paperwork is delayed, it should still be handled in accordance with Article 16 of the Regulations on Pension and Bereavement Payments for Vocational Education Personnel. In addition to the pension they are entitled to, they can also apply for bereavement payments in accordance with the regulations in that article. This is hereby notified.</p>

On the 26th, the schools still went on strike. County Magistrate Chen again gave a speech at the Education Hall in the afternoon to all teachers and staff in the urban area, but to no avail. Consequently, the county government, in accordance with the department's order, detained Gu Ruiyi and two others who incited the student unrest. Yesterday, all schools resumed classes, and those who were detained were released on bail separately.</p>

<p>Interview with He Zhusun: Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency specifically interviewed He Zhusun, Chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession, regarding this matter, and the following conversation took place: (Question) What is your association's position on the case of private primary and secondary schools in the French Concession requesting subsidies from the French Municipal Council? (Answer) Our association has not yet received any official documents on this matter, but we are aware of the details through news reports. Once we receive the official documents, we will forward them according to the situation and do our best to assist. (Question) What is the total amount of taxes paid by Chinese residents in the French Concession each year? Is the French Municipal Council neglecting the educational undertakings of Chinese residents? (Answer) The French Concession collects approximately five to six million in revenue each year, of which one-third is paid by Chinese residents and one-third by Westerners. As for the French authorities' efforts in Chinese education, there is only one Chinese Public School that opened this semester. Given the large population of the French Concession, this single school in a remote location is hardly enough to popularize education. (Question) According to your estimation, what will be the outcome of this matter? (Answer) In my opinion, if the schools are determined to implement this and cite the precedent of the Public Concession, and if the Chinese directors demand this based on the rights and obligations of taxpayers, and consistently advocate for this, it should not be difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>Article 10, Section 2 Cannot Be Deleted</p>
<p>Letter from the Public Works Department to the Municipal Education Bureau:</p>
<p>Regarding the request from the Municipal Education Bureau to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession to delete Article 10, Section 2 of the Regulations on Subsidies for Chinese Private Schools established in the Public Concession, it has been learned that the Director-General of the Public Works Department, Mr. Si, cannot express public opinion on this request. Therefore, a letter was sent yesterday in reply to the Municipal Education Bureau with explanations. The original letter from the Public Works Department is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Respectfully, In our reply to the letter from former Director Xu on August 24, regarding the request from your bureau to delete Article 10, Section 2 of the Regulations on Subsidies for Chinese Private Schools established by Chinese residents, our department has carefully considered and reiterated the matter. The important meaning is further elaborated below:</p>
<p>In Article 10, Section 1 of the general regulations, our department has already explained in detail that any private school applying for educational subsidies must be registered with the Ministry of Education or your bureau, and our department will be happy to provide subsidies. The remaining articles in Article 10 mostly treat foreign schools equally. However, Section 2 stipulates that if any school is found to be engaged in anti-foreign activities or is likely to create national animosity, our department will not provide subsidies or will suspend subsidies. This restriction applies equally to both Chinese and foreign schools.</p>
<p>Our department's regulations are entirely for the purpose of maintaining Sino-foreign harmony and preventing adverse effects. Our department will certainly provide assistance. We hope that your bureau understands the responsibility our department bears and cannot agree to the deletion of Article 10, Section 2. This is a further notification for your information.</p>

<p>Jiansi Team Has Strong Support</p>
<p>The All-Shanghai Open Race Walk Competition for Men and Women initiated by the Chinese Race Walk Association has been greatly praised by Mayor Wu, who has specially donated a large silver cup for the men's 13-mile champion and a large silver shield for the women's 1-mile champion. Zhao Xi'en donated a silver shield, and Sheng Yudu donated four large silver cups for the team champions. Ji Huisheng donated large silver cups for the overall male and female winners, and the Xinwen Bao newspaper donated a large silver shield. In addition, there are also wool blankets for the male and female winners donated by Shanghai Municipal Director Pan, and four sets of sports books donated by the Commercial Press.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chinese Race Walking Association received a letter from the International Race Walking Association yesterday, which stated that many race walkers often practice on the busy Jing'an Temple Road and often proceed in rows, disregarding vehicles. This not only obstructs traffic but also poses a danger. In the future, when practicing, race walkers should choose places with less traffic, such as Weihaiwei Road, etc., to avoid being reprimanded by the police. All our Chinese race walkers should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>The En Race Walking Team, organized by the enthusiastic race walkers Sheng Yudu and Ma Jinfu, held a pre-selection race last Sunday in preparation for the All-Shanghai Open Chinese 13-Mile Race Walk initiated by the Chinese Race Walking Association on the 13th of this month. The results were quite good. Xu Aichen, Mao Hongfa, Wang Longbao, and Le Meigang were selected to participate. It is said that Jiang Junchun of the team is unable to participate due to being sick in bed, which has affected the team's strength. However, with the addition of the new young general Mao Hongfa, there are still high hopes.</p>

<h3 id="e107">The Robbery of "Greater China" <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>This is a strange topic that needs explanation.</p>
<p>The robbery (騎刦) is not referring to the Yan general Qi Jie from the Warring States period; it means that pirates mixed into a steamship, and at a signal, they began to act, forcefully ordering the captain to obey the commands of the pirates and sail to a remote location for robbery. Seizing the ship to commit robbery is called robbery (行刦).</p>
<p>"Greater China" is not our Republic of China; it refers to a steamship owned by a Hong Kong company, sailing to Saigon. It was robbed by pirates midway, which happened last month, and the case is still unsolved. The Hong Kong and Guangdong newspapers have detailed accounts.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that ships encounter robbery; what is surprising is that the steamship is called "Greater China," and the pirates who robbed "Greater China" were well-organized. With a single gunshot, they occupied the entire ship, and all the captain, chief mate, and all crew members were under the control of the pirates! Poor "Greater China"! It suffered a terrible disaster in that non-resistance.</p>
<p>After the pirates succeeded, they ordered the captain to change direction, and to avoid being detected by passing ships, they forced the crew to smear a layer of black oil on the yellow smokestack and paint over the three yellow characters "Greater China" on the side of the ship. However, the English name was carved and could not be painted over, so they had to find a way to cover it up. It can be seen that thieves have their own cunning; where did they learn such sneaky, false organizations? It is laughable, and yet lamentable!</p>
<p>Poor "Greater China" was in the hands of the pirates for as long as two days! Only after the robbery was complete did the pirates leave, and "Greater China" was able to safely return. Although the losses were considerable, at least the ship was not taken away, which was a piece of good fortune in the misfortune of "Greater China."</p>
<p>It is alright for "Greater China" to encounter a temporary robbery; it would be terrible if "Greater China" encountered a permanent robbery! It is alright for the three characters "Greater China" to be painted over with black oil for a short time; it would be terrible if the three characters "Greater China" were painted over with black oil for a long time! Speaking of the "Greater China" that had an accident in Nanyang, one cannot help but think of the "Greater China" that had an accident for a long time. Not only was the original name erased, but a false sign was also hung up! Alas! This is a further step!</p>

<p>— Tian Fang</p>
<p>｜Contradictions Everywhere｜</p>
<p>My old friend Mr. Cheng, used to be my colleague at a certain news agency, but I haven't seen him for quite some time. Yesterday, he surprised me with a visit, and I learned that he is now working as an inspector at the postal censorship office. I asked him why he left the news industry, and he said that he hadn't actually changed careers, but was simply taking on a side job because his income wasn't enough. I was extremely surprised, because on the one hand, he held a certain position in the press, advocating for freedom of speech, while on the other hand, he was engaging in something without legal basis – because the word "censorship" is not mentioned in the current highest law, the Provisional Constitution – and was actually infringing upon the freedom of speech granted to the people by the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage – Article 15 of the Provisional Constitution – wasn't that strange? So I asked him how these two contradictory aspects of his life could coexist. He shook his head and sighed, saying, "Don't even ask. In the 20th century, isn't everything full of contradictions? People say 'disarmament' but secretly engage in 'military expansion'. The people are starving and freezing, while on the other hand, rice, wheat, and cotton are being dumped and burned. When people attack us with guns and cannons, we chant spells to repel the enemy. The volunteers in the Northeast, lacking food and clothing, fight in the freezing cold, while people in China are spending millions of dollars on a competition. Rickshaw pullers, wearing thin clothes and barefoot, run through the wind and snow, shouting that they're hot, while those riding in the rickshaws, wearing fox fur coats, say they're cold. And so on..." I said, "Enough, enough, you don't need to complain anymore. This is truly a contradictory society. But if there's a problem, it needs to be treated. We have to find a way out!" He said, "Indeed, on the one hand, I'm speaking out for the people and fighting for freedom of speech, but on the other hand, I'm holding back newspapers that contain my own writing. It's all a bit ridiculous. But my life is slipping by in this crack. Sometimes I'm confused, it seems as if I am not really alive. I've even thought about quitting, but what other way out is there? Isn't the world full of contradictions everywhere?"</p>
<p>"Ah, a contradictory life, a contradictory world!" I said with melancholy.</p>
<h3 id="e109">How to Cure Our Forgetfulness <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Weng</p>
<p>丨The Impression Given by a Complete History of Resistance Against Japan丨</p>
<p>French General Foch once said, "The greatest crisis for a nation lies in the forgetfulness of its people!" How much of the pain and humiliation we suffered at the hands of the enemy in the spring remains in the minds of most citizens in Shanghai today? Have the bright lights, the intoxicating songs, and the constant dances erased the impressions of the roaring cannons and the heroic blood? This is a question about our national forgetfulness that truly cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Recently, the Wenhua Company published a "Complete History of the Bloody Battle of Shanghai Against the Japanese," which contains a very detailed collection of images and texts about the bloody battle of January 28th. After flipping through it, not only did it bring back the various passionate and stirring impressions of the time, as if I were reliving an old dream, but even the sounds of the anti-Japanese soldiers charging and the cries of the compatriots on the battlefield seemed to come alive from the pictures, one after another! As a result, my steady breathing became rapid, and my blood, which had gradually calmed down, began to boil again!</p>
<p>Forgetfulness is psychological, not physiological. I dare to say that this "Complete History of the Bloody Battle of Shanghai Against the Japanese" can be considered the only good remedy for forgetfulness. If we hope to eradicate the root of the disease, then this book should not only be read temporarily and occasionally, but also has permanent value to be placed on the desk!

<h3 id="e110">On Boasting <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Luding</p>
<p>丨Some Thoughts Inspired by Liang Zuoyou’s Work丨</p>
<p>Singing the "Great Advancement Treasure Map," staging the "Empty City Stratagem," this so-called King of Boasting, Liang Zuoyou, came with excitement, left in disappointment, and returned home defeated. The truth is now clear. With some feelings in his heart, he wrote this essay on boasting, and when he has time, he will write another chapter on flattery.</p>
<p>Boasting, boasting! This is enough to represent the thinking of the average Shanghainese, and it can also be said to be a common phenomenon among Chinese people!</p>
<p>I can see many ambitious people who boast, and I can also see many heroes who boast, but I still cannot believe that they have any real power. Exaggerated words and false claims can indeed dazzle people, and at the time, for a moment, they may even receive considerable admiration!</p>
<p>But: a brand that has no branches can hardly adapt to stores like Daoxiangcun and Lugaojian. How can a paper tiger withstand the howling of jackals, and how can a paper cage endure the ravages of wind and rain? Even if a person has vanity and a tendency to exaggerate, which is common, I do not believe that boasting can save the country or benefit anything.</p>
<p>Using people who boast to save the country will only make the country more hopeless, and using people who boast to handle affairs will only make things more unmanageable. If you say that people who boast have any use at all, that's just nonsense. At the same time, people who boast are also the most superficial and trivial.</p>
<p>In fact, things that can be seen with the eyes don't need to be seen by oneself, and mirrors that can reflect people don't need to reflect oneself. So, how can a cow boast about itself? Therefore, this is where Liang Zuoyou failed, and this is also a lesson for many friends who boast.</p>

<p>— Sun Wenni</p>
<p>丨A Study of Filial Sons and Virtuous Grandchildren丨</p>
<p>When people unfortunately break something they love, of course, they are momentarily stunned and reluctant to throw it away. This is indeed the result of love: a surge of regret.</p>
<p>Parents are indeed the most intimate objects of innate love and affection in humanity. If, unfortunately, a death occurs, it is certainly worthy of grief and mourning. But to express the sadness in one's heart, is there no other way besides using extravagant memorial banners, grand funerals, and ostentatious displays? One should also think about whether one's filial piety during their lifetime was sufficient, whether one served them with respect, and fulfilled their ambitions and desires. If you feel that there are one or two areas where you were not able to be thorough, then is this moment of extravagance meant to show off for the dead, or to embellish one's own shortcomings and save face?</p>
<p>Ask: "The deceased finds peace in the earth," what does this mean! If you think it's right, then just find a piece of high ground that is not susceptible to wind and water erosion, bury the remains of the deceased, so that there is no worry of exposure after many years and months, or the disease of being overturned and disturbed. Isn't that also a way to show love for one's parents?</p>
<p>Then again, is the current social trend able to allow people to do this? This is indeed a big question. But the wealthy, in order to blindly follow the trend, spare no expense in wasting money, without considering the wishes of their parents, to create some public welfare. The guilt they deserve goes without saying. And even poor families are not afraid to borrow money to save face. What does this mean?</p>

<p>— Lane Yanqiao</p>
<p>He didn't appreciate how good the twenty-dollar meal was, he only felt that this gathering was more exciting than the wedding feast when he took a concubine the year before. Why should they rigidly separate men and women, with the women's table tucked away deep in the women's hall? After all, since the National Revolution, society has become a little more vibrant.</p>
<p>He returned with a slight buzz from the evening breeze and the glaring electric lights, revisiting the things that had just happened in his lonely bedroom.</p>
<p>He thought that although he had a beautiful wife and concubines at home, "comparisons must be made to distinguish the superior from the inferior." This principle was unavoidable. His first wife was naturally outdated, not worth mentioning. The concubine was still in her prime, and since she had been able to transform from a country bumpkin into a mistress, why couldn't he make her more modern? No, even if her appearance was modernized, her innate, uncarved qualities could not be further sculpted. Unable to read a single word, how could she understand miniature golf or Charleston? She was used to hearing only 18th-century language at home, how could she keep up with the witty and clever remarks that could serve as a modern girl's quotations? No, definitely no, he was discouraged.</p>
<p>Later, he thought, I have plenty of money, why not get another one here? Not as a concubine, but as a girlfriend, that's it! Girlfriends are great, let's pursue one, he became excited again.</p>
<p>Discouragement and excitement fought each other, keeping him awake all night. The next day, he went to his department, and a sense of disappointment arose again.</p>
<p>The female colleague, cursed by the tabloids as a flower vase, handled official business with light and lively movements, and sent it over. Although the characters were written a bit crooked, the fragrance of perfume covered it up, so it didn't seem childish. Although the sentences were a bit difficult to understand, her sharp and crisp words explained them clearly. It would be best if she often brought official business over, deliberately scrutinizing the official business more closely, so that he would have the opportunity to talk to her. When there was no official business for a long time, he would go over to see them work. Thinking of "flower vase," he couldn't help but secretly praise the tabloid's metaphor, the mockery was pleasing. Fortunately, this kind of spiritual comfort made the monotonous political life not so depressing. Too bad the eight-hour workday was too short.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Gold Market Continues Downward Trend <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Continuing Decline of 4.8 Taels. Yesterday, due to the autumn racing season, the gold market only traded for half a day in the morning. However, the market continued to show weakness, already breaking through 740 taels, the situation was chaotic again, and the prices fluctuated rapidly. The difference between the high and low prices in the morning was only 3.6 qian. Overall, compared to the previous morning, it fell another 4.8 qian. The intentions of the dealers seemed to be downward, with the bearish side dominating. Initially, it was weak, the silver market reported gains, and the exchange rate also rose. It was thought that both the domestic and foreign markets for exchange bills were loose, and then it returned to within 35 taels. The Central Bank exchanged US dollars for December spot goods with Dachengtakangrun, totaling 735 units, priced at 136.8 taels (each unit is equivalent to US$223). Moreover, because the "wise men" on the market showed courage, the prices became firm, and the price was pulled up by 3 taels. However, the selling side was still active, and the exchange market seemed to loosen, and the market returned to the lower reaches. At noon, it turned flat, at about 36 taels. In November, Ruikang, on the short side, exchanged 35 units with Qianchangxiang, paying a premium of 1.9 qian, and it was also heard that other firms exchanged for 2.1 qian. The afternoon was closed for holiday. The situation in the morning is listed below.</p>
<p>There were several small advances and retreats. From the opening of the December market, it immediately fell by 4 taels, to 736.7 taels (before the opening, it was called 37.8 taels to 6.7 taels). It was thought that American silver actually rose by 3/8 of a point, and the private telegram was 5/16. After the market closed, the US came to buy. Then it decreased slightly to 6.5 taels. However, Yuanmao, Yongqianchangxiang and others bought in and raised it to 7.3 qian. However, Hengyu, Yifeng and Zhaofengchang suddenly came to sell, and it immediately retreated by more than 1 tael, to 5.5 qian. HSBC and Huabi both issued December US dollars at 125. However, Bingxing, Yuanhengyuantai, Qianchangxiang, Yifeng, etc. bought in. Although HSBC listed a higher price of half a gear, British 125 and US 25, the gold market was still flat. At 9:00, it was 6.67 qian. Domestic US dollars stabilized, and various banks did December 25 and January 3125. Afterwards, a slight hard trend was seen. Because Hengxing, Yifeng, Hengyu, Yongfeng, Yifeng, Yongfutaihengfuchang and others continued to compete to sell, at 9:15, it finally became 4.6 qian. After that, it showed a steady trend again. Yuan Kangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Yifeng, Yonghongkang, Yongzhaofengchang and others had unabated buying interest. Especially since the Central Bank exchanged more than 700 cash units, Dachengtakangrun offset the futures. Also, because Huabi absorbed December US dollars at 25, and Huayinxing absorbed 1875, the market price revolved and rose by more than 3 taels (however, there was a 1 tael review between 9:30 and 10:00. At that time, Hengxing continued to sell more than 200 units). Until 10:10, it was 7.9 qian. Hengxingbingxing, Daxingxing, Yongzhaofengchang, Yongfengruixing and others suddenly came to sell, and immediately retreated by 23 taels. At 10:20, it was 35 taels. It was heard that the Central Bank opened another 105 spot units, priced at 36.5 taels, sold by Runchangyong. And Yuanmaoyong, Shunlizhifengyong and others all entered. Wheat firms and Mitsui absorbed December and January US dollars at 1875. At 11:00, it saw 7.4 qian again. Fu Xingxing, Hengyu, Tongtai, Changdacheng, etc. took this opportunity to sell. Generally, the scattered bullish households also spit it out. And because US dollars turned loose, it seemed that the banks rejected the meaning, so the market price suddenly fell into a state of weakness, depreciating by 3 taels. However, there was a return of several qian. At 11:20, it suddenly became 4.3 qian. Later, Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, Yuanxingyong and others bought in, and Fuxingyongfufan also picked up, and February US dollars were again absorbed by the bank at 4375, and December at 25, resulting in 11:30 at 6.5 taels. In the future, the deposits and withdrawals of each firm were few, and the price fluctuated slightly. The midday closing was 35.9 qian, a decrease of 4.8 qian compared to the previous day (it has been falling for three days). According to the maximum of 7.9 qian and the minimum of 4.3 qian in half a day, there is a difference of 3.6 qian. Although there is no dramatic change, people's hearts are in a trance and it is difficult to predict. The naked interest rate is increased by 11.25 taels.</p>
<p>The listed price is slightly higher by 2 taels. The listed price is 25 higher for US dollars, so it was changed to 807 taels, which is about 712 taels to 70 taels. After the review, it was 73 taels, and finally 71 taels, which is 2 taels less than the previous morning. The registered accounts were 38 taels in November and 36 taels in December, with a water supplement of 37 taels.</p>
<p>Most of the transactions of various firms were sold. According to the statistics on the table, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, Hongkangyong, Shunli, Wanxing, Huofengyong, Bingxing, Dachengtakang and Zhifengyong all entered. Yuantai, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Yuanxingyong, Tongtaichang and Zhaofengchang were in and out.</p>
<p>Chang and Xie Xingyong sold more than 100 units. Ruixing sold more than 100 units on behalf of foreign merchant Qiao Ribu. Fuyu Yong sold and then entered, about 500 units. Futaiheng, Daxingyong, Yongfeng all came from the Dalian gang, entered a total of more than 400 units and then sold 200 units. The Guang gang (Hengxing Yifeng) sold a total of 13400 units, and then entered 4500 units, including transactions on behalf of customers, and those who did hedge funds bought some. The total number of units of each firm is about 24,000 or more.</p>

HSBC listed a higher price of half a gear, British gold 125 and US dollars 25. Hong Kong suddenly fell by another 25 (calculated at 76 and a half taels). The rest were even cheaper, and the trend of the domestic market was also loose. British gold initially remained flat and then hardened. As a result, it was 125 higher than the previous morning. There were limited transactions. Various banks did each other, and the Jin gang rarely made deposits or withdrawals. Mumbai electricity entered January and US dollars were loose in the morning. Afterwards, there was a slight sound, and at noon there was an appearance of being wide and comfortable. The overall increase was 1875, and about 890,000 yuan was involved in half a day. Various gold firms and the Dalian gang all threw it out, and the hedge funds returned to gold. There were not a few banks doing it with each other.

<h3 id="e117">Securities: Demobilization Rises by One Yuan <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>｜Other Slight Increases, Peaceful Trend｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation of various bonds in the Huashang Securities Exchange, there was not much spot exchange out. A total of 28,000 yuan was opened throughout the day. The buying and selling of the 19 customs and 20 customs was more and more active. The market situation was better than the beginning of last week. It is estimated that the transaction volume in the two sessions in the morning reached nearly 5 million yuan, and more than 3 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 8,035,000 yuan. Among them, the demobilization of 19 good, 20 customs each accounted for 780,000 yuan, 20 volums 1,110,000 yuan, unified tax 1,535,000 yuan, salt tax 1,650,000 yuan, and others also exceeded the previous ones, but 96 finance had no market. As for the trend of each bond, the demand for demobilization was the strongest in the market. All parties paid the most attention to its purchase, and the demand and supply situation was very sincere. It continued to rise very strongly, and its near and far-term prices have all broken through 52 yuan. Although the buying sentiment in the market for other bonds was still strong, the price has risen quite a bit recently, so selling transactions were not lonely. Therefore, although the price still rose, the demand and supply were slightly flat.

However, observing the overall trend of the two securities markets, no major changes have been seen.</p>

<h3 id="e118">New York Stock Market is Strong <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>New York Foreign Firm Report: On Monday (7th), the New York stock market, before the election, the short side suddenly continued to make up, resulting in an unusually strong market. It was the most active since October 14th. Not long after, the market price suddenly fell back slightly. Because there were fewer buyers in the market, the Chicago wheat price rose sharply by 2 points, and because the Wenminpei price rose firmly, while the Canadian gold price plummeted, there was such a change. Various financial and commodity markets will be closed tomorrow, Election Day, and there seems to be no market to describe. The total number of transactions throughout the day was 1.6 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market situation is slightly sluggish, and the trend is weakening. Because American cotton has turned downward again, people's hearts are wavering, and the actual market has stalled again. All groups are lifeless, but the bulls of Rongxing are still calm and unmoved. However, the general scattered shorts see the environment as unfavorable and tend to sell. But new sellers are not very enthusiastic, so the overall situation is also dim and lackluster.</p>
<p>Renbiao Market Declines in Two Ways.  The Renbiao forward market opened with American cotton falling again and the market sentiment softening. Scattered longs closed their positions, and various groups fell by seven, eight, or nine cents to one tael. In the afternoon, the market remained flat, falling by one, two, or three cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,300 bales. It was found that Suilong sold 650 bales, Jifeng 750 bales, Yongda 400 bales, Xincheng 450 bales, and Senkang 400 bales. Yichang bought 1,800 bales, Zhenda 600 bales, Dachang 400 bales, and Ruida 500 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market is weak again. Because American cotton has turned down and the South is also hedging sales, people's hearts are tending to weaken. The general scattered longs, seeing the adverse environment, are in a flat mood. The market has returned to a downward trend. As for the amount dumped by a certain factory, there is no intention to replenish. Therefore, the scattered shorts who follow suit are very calm. The current cotton demand from various factories has not improved.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Market Has Few Buyers. The Zheng Biao forward market opened with American cotton falling again, and there was a shortage of buyers in the market. Each month fell by two or three cents. In the afternoon, it fell by another five fen. The total transaction volume for the day was 68,500 dan. It was found that Jifeng sold 3,500 dan, Ruiyuan 2,300 dan, Senkang 1,900 dan, and Yifeng 1,700 dan. Yichang bought 2,700 dan, Dafeng 2,100 dan, Changfeng 1,500 dan, and Guangfeng 3,000 dan, Hengde 1,600 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm initially due to purchases by foreign merchants, but later weakened due to southern hedging and long liquidation. Futures fell by 15 to 17 points, and spot fell by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 7-8 points, and spot rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 9 points.

<p>Shanghai South:  Yesterday, there were more than 50 sources from various groups, but very few transactions on this street. Kiln-dried Yinhua rice arrived in abundance, with prices falling by 6-7 jiao. Early white rice also fell by 3-4 jiao. The situation suffered a slump. Changshu Northern Japonica and Suzhou-Tongzhou prices remained unchanged. However, Luxiang superior rice was scarce and actively sold, and prices tightened.</p>
<p>Xinzha: The rice market suffered a disastrous decline.  Prices for all goods fell step by step upon opening. Early and late rice shrank by 3-4 jiao. Zhongkai white japonica rice also followed, falling by 2-3 jiao. Metamorphosed Yin rice also showed signs of weakness. Because there was too much green rice, the market became looser day by day. The entire day saw over 2,000 shi of rice opened along the river.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Imported Rice Weak <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Xiangxian Customer Rice is Still Active</p>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market was still stagnant. Customers were still not inquiring. This street slightly inquired after its price fell, with over a hundred bags each of Saigon small twisted rice opened, the price was five or six fen lower than the previous market and was one jiao lower than last week. Yesterday, no new customer rice arrived.  The previously arrived Hunan rice was handled by the Beiyang group purchasing three hundred bags, and the Fuzhou group purchasing one hundred and eighty bags. Due to the small inventory and active customers, the market turned firm and was quoted at Hunan mechanical oil nine yuan two jiao seven fen to nine yuan two jiao, No. 1 Saigon eight yuan nine jiao half, small twisted rice seven yuan eight jiao half.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Flour Forward Market Declines <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Flour Exchange Notice Changes from Using "Metamorphosis" to Using Current Certificates</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month saw a good image again. Imported wheat quotations were better by three or four jiao, and high-quality wheat was better by seven or eight jiao. The exchange also announced that all future buying and selling, whether from factories or customers, must use current certificates. Except for shares in the exchange that can be used as substitutes, all other factory and warehouse receipts and valuable securities will no longer be allowed as substitutes. This restriction did not maintain the momentum of flour prices. Large factories also intended to only bring in and not sell out. Therefore, after the opening quotation, people's hearts were quite shaken, and the opening quotations for each month were one or two fen higher than the previous day, and transactions were quite active. However, after a period of excitement, it gradually subsided, and market prices became weak again. Although the exchange and factories are worried about maintaining prices, the environment is such that they cannot resist it. For example, although Tianjin has daily sales of around 40,000, imported flour already accounts for half of it. Nearly 20,000 bags of Australian flour have recently arrived, and there are still over 500,000 bags being shipped in January, February, and March. Since it was set at 1 tael 2 jiao 6 qian, it can now be cheaper again. Fuxin also dumped over 400,000 in February and March, with prices ranging from 1 tael 8 qian 6 fen to 1 tael 8 qian (delivered in Tianjin). Recently, other companies also wanted to dump it, but there were no buyers. Therefore, if Shanghai flour does not follow the trend, it will be completely monopolized by imported flour. If we do not consider maintaining it, how can we improve it later? In the afternoon, each market was still not good due to foreign countries, and the customers' minds were also unusually weak. Tianjin and Fuzhou both had returns (Australian wheat at 3 taels 4 qian 8 fen, factories only eat at 3 taels 4 qian 5 fen). Small and medium-sized factories also dumped, even though the exchange restricted substitutions. According to the decline in global commodity prices, if this port wants to resist it by force, I am afraid that it will be like a praying mantis trying to stop a chariot, and there will be a yellow bird following behind it. As a result, this month was unchanged, December fell by five li, January fell by one and a half fen, February fell by one fen two and a half li, March fell by one and a half fen, and April fell by one fen two and a half li.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Wheat Futures Market is Active in the Morning and Weak in the Afternoon <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month was better by three or four jiao to seven or eight jiao, due to the quotation of Tianjin wheat. Outsiders couldn't help but feel better, but due to the scarcity of actual buyers, even though imported wheat rose, it still could not excessively stimulate people's hearts. Each month was only two or three fen better than the previous day. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was initially stable, but then the flour market fell back again, and Australian wheat was still cheap. The current focus is on Australian wheat as the standard, and without a break in this route, there is little hope for the future. As a result, January was better by one fen, and March and April fell by two fen. The rest had no fluctuations.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reports that on Monday (7th), Chicago wheat rose sharply due to the strong New York stock market, by about two fen or more, so that there were only sellers.

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was even more depressed due to the fall in standard gold and the increase in Dutch exchange rates. The market in the public society became more and more unfavorable, and there were still few transactions in the market. The price of No. 24 coarse sand white RA mark remained unchanged at 14 taels 9 qian and a half due to the small quantity. The asking price for ordinary goods leaving the warehouse was 14 taels 8 qian and a half, while buyers were only willing to pay 14 taels 8 qian, a difference of five fen. Both sides held their ground, resulting in no transaction. The quotations for the remaining No. 20 and No. 18 medium sand white and No. 890 Dutch red sugar were as before, but unfortunately there were few buyers, and there were very few transactions. The market sentiment also changed from firm to weak.</p>

<p>The dried longan from Quanzhou that arrived in the previous two shipments of Hua Ping and Shun An had their large-sized longan already sold. The mid-range products were also gradually being sold. However, the small bottom-grade products were most sluggish due to the concentration of goods from other routes in Shanghai, resulting in the largest inventory. Recently, the bid prices for goods leaving the warehouse were two or three taels lower than before. The company had telegraphed the producing area to inquire. According to the reply yesterday, most of them were unwilling to sell, and it seemed that they were not willing to sell too cheaply for a while.</p>

<p>The metal trade was very peaceful yesterday. Although Dongdi customers needed to handle some goods, the number was not large. The transactions on this street were also very ordinary. Therefore, the various markets were very stable. Unfortunately, the price of pure Hunan antimony rose sharply yesterday. Face-to-face transactions were more numerous than before. The price per ton rose from 240 taels to 255 taels. It was said that there were a total of fifty to sixty tons offered for sale. However, the number of goods arriving in later batches was very small, so the price is likely to continue to rise.</p>

<p>The refined tin market has recently been in excellent condition because there are few customers arriving and the demand from various groups is urgent. The price is also expected to gradually improve. Currently, Xiaochong is estimated at 93 taels, Holland at 103 taels, sheet tin at 100 taels, Jianghua at 100 taels, Hengdi at 96 taels, and Yun tin at 82-83 taels.</p>

<p>The pig lead market has recently experienced strong demand for actual delivery, but the abundant arrival of goods has made people nervous. Therefore, the price has an appearance of being externally strong but internally weak. However, the supply to Guangdong is minimal, so the prospects for the standard product have been declining. Currently, foreign lead is estimated at 12 taels 1 qian and a half, and domestic lead at 11 taels 7 qian and a half. It is heard that apart from occasional transactions in Tianjin, Yantai, and this garrison, there are very limited transactions from other groups. Moreover, overseas pricing has been declining for days, so the market in this port is unlikely to turn around for a while.</p>

<p>Since the issuance of coal briquettes, there have been many categories and the market prices are also inconsistent. Yesterday, the prices of the China Coal Briquette Department suddenly decreased, and the wholesale prices of the same industry in the market also changed accordingly. The wholesale price of old brand briquettes is 25 yuan, loose briquettes is 22 yuan, and steam, stove, and iron stove briquettes is 23 yuan.</p>

<p>Huadong bituminous coal, such as the Ma Wang coal bought by Da Sheng, has recently seen sluggish sales, and the goods piled up in each warehouse are like mountains. It is estimated that there are about 20,000 tons in total, so the price has fallen. Yesterday, the market price was reduced by five qian per unit, and the current selling price is six taels five qian.</p>

<p>Plaid worsted wool was scarce in Shanghai and sales were extremely strong, so the market rose sharply, and the selling price steadily increased. Recently, the weather has gradually turned cold in Japan, causing it to become out of season. Therefore, yesterday, the other party's demand suddenly turned dull. The market in the association appeared weak. The Jia Ning Xian Tu, which sold for 2 taels 9 qian net last week, can now deduct a commission of four or five yuan per box.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Song Ziwen Flew to Beijing Yesterday <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's Advisor Also Accompanied</p>
<p>Transferred to Hankou to Meet Chiang and Zhang</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, acting president of the Executive Yuan, took a private Sikorsky plane to Beijing at 7 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by Zhang Xueliang's advisor, Donald, and secretary Huang Chun-dao. He will then proceed to Hankou to meet Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Xueliang to discuss military and diplomatic issues in North China. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Song Flew to Beijing and then to Hankou: Mr. Song, together with Zhang Xueliang's advisor, Donald, Finance Ministry Secretary Huang Chun-dao, and two guards, took a private Sikorsky plane from Hongqiao Airport to Beijing at approximately 7 a.m. yesterday. After attending a meeting of the Executive Yuan, he took the original plane to Hankou at 11 a.m. to meet with Chairman Chiang. According to Mr. Song, it is difficult to determine whether the second loan of American wheat will succeed. Han Fuju in Shandong has already implemented the withdrawal of troops, which will soon be taken over by the Marine Corps. Liu Zhennian's troops will generally be transferred to Hubei to suppress bandits. The Sichuan affair is an internal problem of that province, and it is believed that it can be resolved. Whether to discuss the reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government at the next meeting of the Executive Yuan has not yet been determined. The statement that the Japanese side's opinions on the Lytton Report have arrived in Shanghai is inaccurate; the government has not yet received this document, and so on.</p>
<p>Chiang, Zhang, and Song to Meet: It is reported that after Mr. Song arrived in Hankou, Zhang Xueliang also flew to Hankou from Ping. Chiang, Zhang, and Song will discuss military, financial, and diplomatic issues in North China, as well as relations with Japan. According to those close to Mr. Song yesterday, the National Government is now focusing all its efforts on dealing with the Northeast issue. After Mr. Song arrives in Hankou, all aspects, including internal and external finance, must be discussed, but diplomacy is the most important, and so on.</p>

<p>Residents of Designated Areas Petition for Relief</p>
<p>Reporters Banqueted Last Night, Representatives Sent to Beijing</p>
<p>Municipal Government Plans to Prioritize Both Construction and People's Livelihood</p>
<p>China Railway Company Inquires and Demands Overdue Payments</p>
<p>The relocation of the Shanghai North Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, the post-war reconstruction of the Zhabei urban area, and the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan are of great significance. The Ministry of Railways, in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Government, has repeatedly discussed and actively planned this. Jiangwan was designated as the passenger terminal, and Zhenru as the intermodal terminal. The Shanghai Municipal Government announced the acquisition of land needed for the two stations. According to a Beijing correspondent of the Xin Sheng News Agency's interview with the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry recently decided that the two projects are extremely complex and cannot be completed in a short period. They have decided to establish a station within the original railway boundary on Song Park Road as a preparation for the relocation of the North Station. Construction is currently underway. At the same time, they plan to start building the intermodal station first to meet urgent needs. However, the construction of the station is closely related to the traffic on the streets and roads of Shanghai. The Ministry of Railways has consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government several times, hoping that the road and bridge projects can be connected at the same time as the new station is built, so as to promote each other's progress. The Ministry of Railways' plan, the consultation methods with the municipal government by the appointed councillors Xia Guangyu and Chen Yaozu, and the replies regarding the suspension of property transfers in the designated areas and the petitions from merchants to change routes are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Plan The Ministry of Railways has specially established a Two-Route Construction Committee to specialize in planning the development of the new North Station. The current decisions are: Zhenru will be the permanent intermodal station, and Jiangwan Road will be the Shanghai passenger station. The recently announced area south of the Zhenru Railway, originally intended for acquisition, has been reduced by 198 meters. Another 700 mu or so will be added west of Zhongshan Road and north of Jiaotong Road for the construction of car sheds and transfer tracks. The total construction cost is estimated to be 10 million yuan, and the groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled for New Year's Day next year, with construction starting immediately and a completion period of two years. The land circled for the passenger and intermodal stations will be acquired in accordance with the National Land Acquisition Law, and the funds will be issued by the bank on behalf of the government. The architectural design style has not yet been fully determined. Shanghai is China's only commercial port, and the attention of both Chinese and foreigners is focused on it, so efforts should be made to make it solid and beautiful.</p>
<p>Relocation Methods The Ministry of Railways previously sent Xia Guangyu and Chen Yaozu to negotiate all matters with the Shanghai Municipal Government. The record is as follows: Before the completion of the route connecting the intermodal station to the Jiangwan passenger terminal, a track will be temporarily reserved between Song Park Road and Baoshan Road to facilitate the entry of locomotives into the Wusong factory for repairs. In addition, the route from Jiangwan passenger terminal to the Hongjiang Wharf will be measured first, and the detailed construction methods will be determined by both parties when necessary. The Ministry of Railways believes that the following should be decided as the necessary process for the development of the Zhabei urban area: ㈠ Decide to relocate all tracks and buildings of the railway west of Baoshan Road and east of Datong Road. ㈡ The relocation steps are: First, set up a temporary station on Song Park Road to temporarily replace the existing North Station, and clear the section of land west of Baoshan Road and east of Song Park first. Second, after the completion of the Zhenru intermodal station, move the temporary station on Song Park Road and clear the area. ㈢ The Municipal Government will expedite the construction of Song Park Road from Xinjiang Road to Zhongxing Road to facilitate traffic to the temporary station on Song Park Road. The Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau will send personnel to measure the route of Song Park Road within the road boundary with the Railway Bureau, and immediately establish the road boundary to facilitate the Railway Bureau in determining the location of the temporary station. The Municipal Government's Public Works Bureau will plan the road system within the scope of roads west of Baoshan Road and east of Datong Road, and announce it after obtaining the approval of the Ministry of Railways. ㈤ Decide to start construction of the Zhenru intermodal station and the temporary station on Song Park Road at the same time. The Municipal Government will expedite the construction of the extension lines of Ge Road and Xiaoshadu Road, and the Suzhou River Bridge, to connect with Zhongshan Road to facilitate the Zhenru station. ㈦ Decide to build the Jiangwan passenger terminal at an appropriate time. ㈧ The Ministry of Railways will send personnel in advance to measure the connecting lines between the intermodal station, the Jiangwan passenger terminal, and the Hongjiang Wharf, and draw up drawings for approval. ㈨ The Ministry of Railways will be responsible for the cost of building roads and ditches within the road boundary. ㈩ The Municipal Government will be responsible for the construction costs of ditches and bridges outside the road boundary. ㈩㈠ Decide to request the Executive Yuan to approve and order the Ministry of Interior to announce the circled land.</p>
<p>Location and Scope The location of the Shanghai terminal, as decided by the Ministry of Railways, is the section west of Shida Road, north of Nanxiangyin Road, and along the west side of Zhongshan North Road for 6,000 feet, as the location for the passenger connecting station. The section west of Zhongshan Road and east of Zhenbei Road, along the existing railway line for 3,000 feet north and south, is the location for the intermodal station.</p>
<p>Requests from Residents Ye Youcai and Yu Zhongxian, general managers of Huasheng Electric Factory, petitioned for the exchange of land adjacent to Jiaotong Road because the factory was included in the circled area. The Ministry of Railways stated that it intended to allocate the land, which had already been circled, and it was difficult to approve the request. In addition, Hou Xuanqing and Zhang Lingen and other residents of Wangjiajing, Zhangjiazhai, and Jinxiang in Pengpu District and Zhabei Jiaotong Road petitioned for the avoidance of villages. The Ministry of Railways replied that the Zhenru station is north of the railway and in a necessary location for the route, so avoidance is not possible. Shen Wensheng and Li Xianting and other residents of Lijiajiao, Chenjiazhai, and Wangjiazhai petitioned to avoid the more than 200 mu of land in the six villages including Lijiajiao Village in the Ninth and Tenth Sheng Maps of Zhenru. The Ministry of Railways also replied that avoidance was not possible and that all sections would be acquired in accordance with the Land Acquisition Law.</p>
<p>Ministry of Railways Notice Regarding the announcement, it is noted that the Zhenru Intermodal Station is the hub for passenger transport on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines. All arrangements and plans must be as perfect and applicable as possible to reduce the time for shunting and increase the efficiency of transshipment. The Ministry has reconsidered and made a final decision to slightly change the layout plan of the intermodal station to ensure permanence. The land boundary originally intended to be acquired south of the railway has been reduced by 190 feet from the railway side, reducing the land to be acquired by approximately 1,400 mu. Another area of land north of Jiaotong Road and west of Zhongshan Road, with an area of approximately 700 mu, will be added for the construction of various car sheds and transfer tracks. The revised acquisition of land for the station has been reported by the Ministry to the Ministry of Interior for approval, and the Shanghai Municipal Government has been requested to post maps for announcement. The Jinghu Railway Bureau has been ordered to erect stakes along the boundary as the standard. This notice is hereby issued to inform all landowners in the area to be aware of this and await the price offer for the acquisition. This is the notice.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Instructions The Municipal Government issued an order to the Land Bureau yesterday regarding the request of farmers in Zhenru to avoid the land circled by the Ministry of Railways. Regarding the order to comply, the letter No. 1558 (Industrial) from the Nanjing Office of the Ministry of Railways was approved. The Zhenru Intermodal Station layout plan has been slightly changed, and land north of Jiaotong Road and west of Zhongshan Road must be added. Previously, the letter No. 1386 (Industrial) requested your Municipal Government to issue a public notice to temporarily suspend buying and selling transfers. Regarding the area acquired for the intermodal station, the Ministry will draw up revised land use maps and new plans for the 700 mu of land added north of the railway and west of Zhongshan Road within the original boundary intended to be acquired south of the railway, and report them to the Ministry of Interior for approval and announcement. In addition to examining two copies each of the announcement from the Ministry of Interior and the notice from the Ministry of Railways, issuing them to the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus for posting at the acquisition site, and ordering them to immediately erect stakes separately at the red line boundaries drawn in the revised land use map to identify them, three copies of the revised land use map for the area are hereby inspected, and a copy of the announcement from the Ministry of Interior and the notice from the Ministry are hereby copied for your government to check and announce the acquisition in advance. It is also hoped that you will assist the Land Acquisition Office of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Line Construction Committee in handling all acquisition procedures. A corresponding letter is hereby sent to hope that you will check and handle it, and notify the Land Bureau. Please reply as before, etc. Two copies of the revised land use map for the Zhenru Intermodal Station are attached, and copies of each announcement are sent to your office. Examining the case, the transfer of land circled by the Ministry of Railways has caused panic. Municipal councillors from Zhenru and Pengpu districts, farmers such as Shen Wensheng from the Ninth and Tenth Sheng Maps, and farmers such as Hou Xuanqing from Wangjiajing and Zhangjiazhai, and Zhao Chupei and others from Zhao Family Garden have successively petitioned the Ministry to avoid the land, etc. The matter concerns national construction and the livelihoods of farmers. On the one hand, we should assist as much as possible, and on the other hand, we should find ways to alleviate the suffering of the people. We must plan for both in order to proceed without obstacles. Now, as per the previous procedure, in addition to replying and approving, copies of the draft map are hereby copied and enclosed, and each copy is hereby ordered to the Bureau to immediately comply, and jointly with the Ministry of Railways, carefully inspect and clearly determine the scope of acquisition, and consider the people's sentiments, and find ways to reduce the people's panic, to facilitate the process, and report the measures taken at any time. This is the order.</p>
<p>Reception for the Press Last night at 7 o'clock, the Pengpu District Petitioning Group hosted the Shanghai press at the Zhimeilou Restaurant on Fourth Horse Road. More than 30 reporters from various newspapers attended. During the dinner, Hou Xuanqing, a representative of the villagers, stood up and gave a speech, roughly saying that the Ministry of Railways' construction of the intermodal station and circling of civilian land were unrestricted. The area circled so far has reached six or seven thousand mu. The villagers have lived north of Jiaotong Road for generations, and their livelihoods depend entirely on planting flowers, trees, and vegetables. Recently, they have been affected by the Shanghai Incident, and the cattle industry has declined. Just as they were hoping for government relief, the Ministry of Railways suddenly circled all the farmers' fields and houses. The villagers can neither cultivate nor survive. The villagers' villages are all north of Jiaotong Road and can be avoided in terms of geographical situation. Now, the land that should be avoided is being circled, while the land that should not be avoided is being reduced by more than a thousand mu. The villagers are fighting for their lives and will demand to the end. They hope that their colleagues in the press will uphold justice in their commentary and provide assistance. The villagers are grateful and hopeful for food and clothing, etc.</p>
<p>Petition to the Government Yesterday, the petitioning group submitted a document to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, stating that the Ministry of Railways' indiscriminate acquisition of civilian land in the name of building a new intermodal station for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, or abuse of public power for private gain, is requested to be thoroughly investigated and the scope of the circled area is limited to avoid villages and protect the people's lives and avoid resentment. The Ministry of Railways is building an intermodal terminal in the area west of Zhongshan Road in Zhabei and in the Zhenru Pengpu area. The two Railway Bureaus have repeatedly stated that the maximum amount of civilian land to be acquired is four or five hundred mu, which is sufficient for use. It has been found that the currently surveyed land occupies approximately three or four thousand mu south of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and approximately one thousand mu north of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. It is difficult to ensure that there is no abuse of the name of the intermodal station and indiscriminate acquisition of civilian land for future profit. Moreover, the villages circled north of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway are more populated, with approximately 500 households and approximately 1,500 houses. Farmers cultivate flowers and trees for their livelihood. Once forced to relocate, the losses are already considerable, and the state of fragmentation is even more evident. The civilian Shi Rui requested the Ministry of Railways to promptly find a way to avoid the land, but the request has not been approved. The people are unable to bear it any longer and will either create a situation where the river overflows or resort to desperate measures. The Executive Yuan has always valued public opinion and should provide relief to those who have survived the disaster. Therefore, we dare to prepare a document to appeal for investigation, limit the Ministry of Railways to find ways to avoid the villages north of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to alleviate the people's difficulties and avoid resentment. We are in extreme fear and await orders. We respectfully submit this.</p>
<p>Representatives Go to Beijing Last night, the petitioning group first selected eight representatives, Hou Xuanqing, Zhao Youting, Zhao Wenxiu, Zhang Zhongxiang, Tao Wenyuan, Zhao Zuyan, Zhao Chupei, and Zhao Songfeng, to take the document to Beijing by night express to petition the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Railways, demanding the avoidance of villages. British Demand for Overdue Payments The Shanghai branch of the Sino-British Bank suddenly sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways because of the relocation of the North Station to Zhenru, requesting that the truth be announced and demanding overdue payments. The original letter roughly stated that according to reports in various newspapers in Shanghai, your Ministry recently had a new plan to prepare to relocate the North Station to the vicinity of Zhenru, and the cost of this construction is estimated to be more than 10 million yuan, as well as the addition of buildings, warehouses, platforms, the laying of branch tracks, the construction of a new machine factory, and the relocation of the original machines from Wusong to the new factory. We are extremely grateful for this plan, but we hope to be informed of the truth and the source of the funds. Furthermore, we hope that the overdue debt of 12.8 million yuan will be repaid as soon as possible, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Burmese Government Imposes Land Route Raw Silver Import Tax <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Cables to Instruct Consul in Burma to Negotiate Against It</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Yunnan Overseas Chinese Anti-British New Tax Support Association, reporting that the raw silver import tax has now been implemented, and the association received the following reply from the Ministry of Finance:</p>
<p>Yunnan Telegram To the esteemed Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: On October 15th, the Burmese government suddenly implemented a new import tax on raw silver via the Yunnan-Burma land route, with a tax rate of seven annas and a half per ounce, equivalent to approximately 46%, and prohibited the import of Chinese currency. It was not until the 17th that the Yunnan government was notified, causing Chinese merchants to suffer great losses in the raw silver trade thousands of miles along the way, and making it impossible for Chinese merchants to pay off their commercial debts to British Burma, which is of particular importance. Yunnan-Burma trade has a long history, and there has never been a written or de facto tax on the transportation of gold and silver or the circulation of currency between the two countries. The British side has suddenly created a new law, breaking the precedent and destroying the commercial relations between the two countries. Moreover, the announcement was made after the implementation, which is not allowed by law. Hundreds of thousands of merchants in Yunnan and Burma are extremely angry and vow to fight to the death. In addition to cabling the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ambassador to the UK to protest and demand cancellation, your esteemed association, as the leader of the national business community, is requested to unanimously support the effort to achieve the cancellation as soon as possible to save overseas Chinese and maintain the national economy. I am waiting anxiously for your order. Yunnan Support Association of Overseas Chinese in Burma Against New British Tax, respectfully, East.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Telegram To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, please forgive my belated reply. I have examined the telegram, and the measures to reduce taxes on the land borders of our country were cancelled by order in 1929. Goods imported and exported on the Burmese border have been taxed at the full rate in accordance with the tariff for several years. It is not convenient to restore the tax reduction system at this time, which is inconsistent with the principle of taxation that should be followed by the land customs. However, the Burmese government's sudden imposition of import taxes on Chinese goods that have never been taxed will certainly have an impact on trade with Burma in the border provinces. The Ministry has already requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the Consul in Burma to negotiate against it nearby to provide relief. A corresponding telegram is hereby sent for your information. Ministry of Finance Seal.</p>
<h3 id="e162">City Chamber of Commerce Receives Telegram Announcing Cancellation of Production and Sales Tax on Jiangxi Porcelain <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Replaced by Business Tax of 440,000 Yuan Annually</p>
<p>No More Branch Offices to be Set Up for On-the-Spot Inspections</p>
<p>Porcelain merchants across the country believe that the production and sales tax in Jiangxi is unbearable and have repeatedly petitioned the National Government for relief, requesting it to be abolished. Recently, Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Yansong, a standing committee member, accompanied porcelain industry representatives to visit President Chiang Kai-shek and Xiong Shihui to personally explain the difficult situation of the porcelain industry. The Jiangxi authorities initially agreed to change to business tax, no longer setting up offices for inspection. The tax amount is 450,000 yuan annually. Porcelain merchants again requested a reduction. According to news from the City Chamber of Commerce, the matter has been resolved and the tax amount will be reduced. The following is the telegram from the porcelain merchant representatives: To Mr. Xiaolai and Mr. Yansong of the City Chamber of Commerce: Thanks to your strong support and the efforts of Committee Member Fan, the porcelain tax matter has been changed to a business tax with an annual amount of 440,000 yuan, which has been approved and resolved. Special thanks. Yan Zheng, respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Booksellers Association Appeals for the Beixin Bookstore <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Booksellers Association telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan the other day, stating that Nanjing Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan, please be advised that reports state that the Central Government intends to seal up the Beixin Bookstore because Muslims object to the book "Little Pig Bajie." We are deeply apprehensive. Beixin has agreed to destroy the book and apologize, which seems to be the end of the matter. Otherwise, if a lawsuit is filed according to law, there are legal procedures to follow. If a store is sealed up due to mistakenly receiving a manuscript, then the cultural undertaking will be in danger, which is not what the rule of law should be. Urgent appeal, hoping you will take it into consideration. Shanghai Booksellers Association, respectfully, Yu.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Sichuan War, the General Assembly of the Abolish Internal War Grand Alliance has repeatedly telegraphed to dissuade it, and sent separate telegrams to the chambers of commerce in Chengdu and Chongqing to jointly carry out the effort, but with very little effect. The association felt that if it wanted to achieve the purpose of abolishing the central war, it must first increase its own strength. Therefore, it actively carried out the establishment of branches and the increase of members. In addition to the Pingjin branches, which have been formally established one after another, the Sichuan branch was also established in Chongqing on October 16. It has now received the branch's report on the establishment situation and the published circular telegram, declaration, and list of staff members.</p>

<p>Japanese Officers Come to Shanghai to Review Merits The Japanese government specially dispatched Lieutenant Colonels Akashiba and Harada of the Army and Navy, accompanied by Secretary Ide of the Order of Merit Bureau, to first investigate in Dong Shao, and then came to Shanghai by ship from Dalian to review the merits of non-armed Japanese people who assisted in the war and plainclothes teams during the 128 Incident. They also visited Jiangwan and Wusong to see the war results. Chairman Yasui of the Administrative Committee has now handed over the names of people with meritorious service in the Shanghai War to the two officers, who took them back to Tokyo on the Nagasaki Maru last night to apply for merit awards.</p>

<p>The Da Mei Evening News stated that the 2nd Battalion of the British Army Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders arrived in Shanghai yesterday (7th) on the transport ship "Neuralia" from Hong Kong. This morning, they disembarked and proceeded along Nanjing Road to the barracks on Great Western Road for garrison. The 1st Battalion of the Welch Regiment, which was originally stationed in the barracks, departed about an hour after the Highlanders arrived, proceeding along Nanjing Road to Avenue Road (now Nanjing West Road) to the Huangpu Wharf, boarding the "Neuralia" transport ship, and is scheduled to set sail for Hong Kong on Thursday. The bottom of the Lincolnshire Regiment is also returning south on the same ship. In addition, Major General Sunderland, commander of the British forces in China, also arrived in Shanghai on the transport ship this time, because he will hand over to the new commander, Major General Pollard, in February next year. He came to Shanghai to bid farewell to his troops.</p>

<p>In recent days, many young people from all walks of life have gone to the Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Team to request joining. As of yesterday, there have been more than 200 people. The team has been organizing supplies and finances in recent days. Once there is some progress, the second batch will depart. Yesterday, the team sent personnel to Minhang Town to solicit donations from all walks of life, and the results were quite good. The faculty and students of the Minhang Rural Normal School were very enthusiastic, expressing their willingness to fulfill their national obligations. They agreed to start fundraising immediately, with faculty members donating two yuan each and students donating according to their circumstances, which can raise about 400 yuan to help the team and supplement the needs of the second batch of departures. Chen Ruchen, director of the Bengbu Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society Medical Team, led all 80 members and contacted the departure matters the day before. The team agreed to let them depart with the second batch and allowed them to become the Second Company of the Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Team, with Chen Ruchen as the captain of the Second Company. The team also felt that the need for supplies was very great, especially medical supplies. Therefore, in addition to encouraging donations from all walks of life, it also sent a letter to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association yesterday, requesting it to provide various needed supplies from the same perspective (letter omitted).

Yesterday, Wang attended the regular meeting of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association to report on the truth of the war on the front lines. It is heard that the association will directly deliver the assistance part to Zhu Jiqing, the commander-in-chief of the army, in order to unify it.

<h3 id="e173">National Federation of Commerce Calls for Implementation of Resolutions from the People's Food Conference <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Appeal from Businessmen and Residents of Dangtu County, Anhui Province</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "We have received an urgent telegram from the Chamber of Commerce of Dangtu County, Anhui Province, stating that this year's grain prices have plummeted, the rural economy is bankrupt, and there is already the danger of farmers abandoning their fields. However, the authorities in Anhui not only fail to show compassion or provide relief, but instead impose heavy taxes on the only lifeline of rice and grain, making it impossible to turn the low prices into money. This is directly driving 30 million people to disaster. The enemy's intentions are realized, and our worries are endless. In addition to sending telegrams to appeal, we earnestly request your federation to intervene and alleviate this dire situation." We have received this communication. Upon investigation, the drop in grain prices has already led to the bankruptcy of the rural economy. The central government previously convened a National People's Food Conference, and the first resolution was to ensure the unobstructed flow of food within the country. Now, after the National People's Food Conference, the Anhui Provincial Government has resumed levying taxes on exported rice and grain, with each dan taxed as high as sixty cents, which is completely contrary to the purpose of the central government's convening of the Food Conference. We hereby submit this to your departments and yuan for review and approval, earnestly requesting that the Anhui Provincial Government be promptly ordered to stop this practice to alleviate the suffering of the people, and to quickly implement all resolutions of the People's Food Conference. This is our most sincere plea. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Outline of the Comprehensive Shanghai Gazetteer Finalized by the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Since Mr. Liu Yazi and Mr. Zhu Shaoping took office at the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office, they have immediately engaged in organization, hiring editorial staff, and actively proceeding with the work. The categories and general outline of the comprehensive gazetteer were finalized early on, and editing has already begun. We have now obtained the tentative categories and general outline of the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer from the office and are publishing them below, which we believe will be welcomed by those concerned. Before the categories and general outline, there are several "Remarks to Readers," which are also included below:</p>
<p>Remarks to Readers 1. The members of the editorial department of this office, with reference to local gazetteers from various parts of our country and various foreign annual reports, and based on the actual situation in Shanghai, have divided the Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer into twenty-five categories on a tentative basis. The organizational methods of these twenty-five categories can be roughly divided into four parts: (1) Categories 1 to 5 describe Shanghai's history and geography and its general situation, belonging to the nature of a general overview in the overall organization of the gazetteer. (2) Categories 6 to 13 focus on describing the various administrative conditions of Shanghai throughout history, belonging to the nature of the main body in the overall organization of the gazetteer. (3) Categories 14 to 22 describe the various aspects of the situation of the people of Shanghai, also belonging to the nature of the main body in the overall organization of the gazetteer. (4) Categories 23 to 25 are charts and graphs for reference when reading the various categories of this gazetteer, belonging to the nature of a conclusion in the overall organization of the gazetteer. 2. The general outline of the twenty-five categories of the gazetteer is tentatively based on the tentative categories and has not been reviewed by specialists. Inadequacies are certainly unavoidable and will be revised. Furthermore, if historical materials are abundant during editing, they will be expanded and changed. 3. The content of each category of the gazetteer may have overlaps with each other. Except for necessary ones, the editorial staff of this office will gather together and often discuss them to strive to avoid them. 4. Below the general outline, there are sub-items. For example, the general outline of the Finance Category has only seven items, but the sub-items total twenty-two. Detailed sub-items for all categories will be printed separately later and then requested for further instruction. 5. Domestic scholars are earnestly hoped to provide practical criticisms of the tentative categories and general outline of this office in order to correct any shortcomings. 6. Although the categories, general outline, and sub-items of this gazetteer have all been tentatively determined, there are still many difficulties in editing, in addition to collecting various historical materials. For example, the former of the two categories of customs and local conditions and figures suffers from being tedious and trivial, and the latter lacks standards. If various circles can give us their insightful opinions, our colleagues will accept them sincerely. Attached notice 1. Due to the limited human resources and finances of our office, we can only realistically work on what is permitted by the current facts and proceed step by step. As for various large-scale plans, we dare not make any predictions at this time. 2. Our office's reference books and reference materials are extremely scarce. We hope that those who sympathize with our office will do their best to help, either by donating books, photos, or newspapers, or by transcribing historical materials. We will be extremely grateful for everything. 3. We hope that those who receive the various survey forms issued by our office will be happy to fill them out and return them to our office. 4. Many people in Shanghai still fail to understand the nature of a gazetteer. We hope that those who sympathize with our office can clarify it anytime and anywhere so that we can proceed without error.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of the dispute over disaster relief in northern Anhui, the Anhui Native Place Association of this port previously filed a complaint in the name of its standing committee. The plaintiff's agent included Mr. Xu Shiying's name. Mr. Xu believed that he was a member of the Flood Relief Association, and credit and blame should be shared, so he could not be an agent for the litigation. He immediately entrusted lawyer Li Shirui to withdraw his name from the case at the court. Later, a newspaper reported the news and still listed Mr. Xu's name. At that time, Xu had returned to his hometown for mourning. After hearing about it, he formally published a notice in the newspaper to clarify the matter, and the Shanghai Anhui Native Place Association sent a letter to make corrections. Recently, Xu and Cha Mianzhong and Quan Shaowu exchanged telegrams, and many newspapers have published them. The reply to Mr. Quan is recorded below: "To Brother Quan Shaowu, care of Zhu Yulao in Beiping: I received your telegram. There is no brother's name in the court's accusation. It is a pity for you to issue such absurd words based only on erroneous newspapers. I am the chairman of the Central Disaster Relief Committee and also a member of the National Government Relief Committee. Credit and blame should be shared. If I know that you have done wrong, I will report it to Chairman Song for investigation. There is no need for me to file a lawsuit in my personal name. The Shanghai newspaper has made corrections, which you may not know. The details are in the reply to Brother Zhongmian. Please read it. I have not heard about the lawsuit. Heaven can bear witness. If you must engage in legal proceedings, I will see you after the seven weeks of mourning for my father are over. Ying Yan."</p>
<h3 id="e177">Swire Shipping Company Decides to Postpone Implementation of New Standards <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Social Bureau Schedules Signing</p>
<p>After the Swire Shipping Company, a British company, stipulated the standards for mid-cabin workers on the Yangtze River route, a labor-management dispute arose. The Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry all instructed the Municipal Government to handle the matter properly. After the Social Bureau repeatedly tried to mediate, a conclusion is now within sight. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Postponed Implementation The Swire Yangtze River route, including nine ships such as the Anqing, would inevitably have to lay off more than 1,000 people according to the newly stipulated standards. After mediation by the Municipal Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters, the company's manager initially had a very tough attitude, insisting that it must be implemented. He had notified the compradors of each ship to stay in Shanghai to handle the matter. Now that he deeply knows that it is not easy to do so in reality, he has recently notified the compradors of each ship that the five measures stipulated by the company will be postponed. As a result, the compradors of each ship stopped staying in Shanghai and sailed with the ships.</p>
<p>Scheduled Signing In order to eliminate future disturbances, all mid-cabin workers requested that a specific method be decided.

<h3 id="e181">A Bizarre Murder Case Occurred at a Writer's Gathering <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Just Moved into a Room in a Lane House</p>
<p>A Woman Was Strangled to Death That Night</p>
<p>Lu Hou, a 62-year-old landlady from Nanjing, residing at No. 13 Shude Lane, Xujiahui Town, Shanghai, has four sons, all of whom work elsewhere. Her eldest daughter-in-law, Zhang, lives with Hou on the upper floor, while her third daughter-in-law, Li, lives downstairs. Only the three women reside in the house. Recently, the tenant in the lane house room moved out, so a rental advertisement was posted at the entrance. On the morning of the previous day, a man in his thirties, wearing a long blue cloth gown, claiming to be from Jiangyin and a professor at Nanyang University, inquired about renting the lane house room. Li led him to view the room, and they agreed on a monthly rent of four yuan and fifty cents, with one yuan paid in advance. Around 5:00 PM, the tenant arrived with a woman, bringing bedding, a bamboo suitcase, and some scattered items. Around 7:00 PM, Hou went upstairs to collect the rent and inquire about their identities. She saw the two tenants cooking in the room, with nothing unusual. They replied that the rent would be paid the next day. Unexpectedly, the woman was strangled to death that night, and the murderer escaped at 6:00 AM the next morning. It was not until 4:00 PM yesterday that Hou, not seeing the woman come downstairs, went to the lane house room to collect the remaining three yuan and fifty cents in rent. She saw the woman lying covered by a quilt, called out to her but received no response, and pushed her but could not wake her. When she uncovered the quilt, she was horrified to find a strangled female corpse. Hou was shocked and ran to report to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District of the town. The patrol officer was dispatched to investigate and found that the woman, approximately thirty years old, had a hemp rope around her neck, wore a blue cloth jacket, black cloth trousers, and thread socks, resembling a servant. Apart from a bed, there were no other belongings in the room. The case is very bizarre, and it has not been reported to the household registration office, so the surname is unknown. Yesterday, the local security officer Zhang Qinpu was ordered to report to the court for an inspection. Due to the late hour, officials will be dispatched today for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Workers at the French-Owned Water and Electricity Company's Coppersmith Shop Go on Strike <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Refusal to Grant Holidays</p>
<p>Causes 工人怠工</p>
<p>The entire workforce of over six hundred coppersmiths at the French-owned Water and Electricity Company went on strike yesterday afternoon due to the company's refusal to grant them holidays. Our reporter made specific inquiries to the workers regarding the cause of the strike. According to the workers, on the last day of the annual Grand Racing Carnival, the workers were given a holiday according to precedent, and because today (that is, today) is the last day of the Autumn Racing Carnival, they should not be an exception. When work ended at 11:00 AM today (yesterday), the workers made a request to the authorities but were unexpectedly severely rejected by the foreman. The workers considered the foreman to be violating the precedents and then all went on strike at 1:00 PM. It is said that until 6:00 PM that evening, all six hundred workers left the factory together and went to the labor union to make a resolution. This morning, if there is no key solution, they may have to petition the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Anhui People Deny Loan from Anhui Provincial Government <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association and the Anhui Students Association in Shanghai Telegraphed National Banks to Deny the Anhui Provincial Government's Loan Matters</p>
<p>To the attention of all banks nationwide, as forwarded by the local newspapers: Our province of Anhui has suffered frequent disasters in recent years, and its vitality has been depleted. However, the provincial government authorities have disregarded the people's hardships and have both illegally collected 口照 donations and arbitrarily issued 5 million in road construction bonds, even designating rice donation revenue as collateral. What exploitation can the survivors after the calamity endure? The people of Anhui vow never to recognize this. Therefore, on the first day of this month, a joint meeting of all Anhui public organizations in Shanghai was held, and it was unanimously resolved to notify all banks nationwide that they should not underwrite or mortgage bonds issued by the Anhui provincial government to avoid being implicated. In addition to dispatching representatives to the government to appeal, we hereby send a telegram to the banking industry across the country based on the resolution of the conference, urging that the road construction bonds issued by the Anhui provincial government should not be underwritten or mortgaged. If there is any private transfer of funds, the people of Anhui will absolutely not be responsible for repayment. The examples of Ni Sichong and Ma Lianjia in the past serve as precedents. We respectfully inform you. The Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association and the Anhui Students Association in Shanghai respectfully salute.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Decline of the Yangtze River National Steamships <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Lack of Cargo, the Route Along the Yangtze River. After the January 28th Incident this year, domestic financial stagnation, the cessation of trade by visiting merchants, coupled with the year's floods, reduced the purchasing power of the people. Furthermore, the outbreak of the Sichuan War disrupted the arrival of goods from the upper Yangtze River, and imports were also greatly reduced. The sharp decline in goods shipped from Shanghai led to a slump in the business of national steamships on the Yangtze River. Currently, the number of regular Jianglun (Yangtze River steamer) outgoing shipments to the upper reaches is only two to three-tenths of the usual amount. In the past, each round trip would generate freight revenue of around 10,000 yuan, but now it only brings in 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, which is not enough to cover the cost of fuel.</p>
<p>Reduced Ships, The most numerous of the Yangtze River national steamships is the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which has always been considered the backbone of shipping. According to the company's current business report, apart from the Jiangshun and Jiang'an ships, other ships such as Jiangyu, Jiangxin, Jianguo, and Jiangjing are still operating, but due to a shortage of cargo, all ships are reporting losses, with none making a profit. The Sanbei Company originally had eight ships operating on the Yangtze River, but due to the decline in business, three ships have been withdrawn, and the rest have been rerouted to places such as Haizhou to reduce losses. The Ningjing Wheel from the Ning Shao company has also stopped operating. This year's downturn in the Yangtze River shipping industry is rare in decades.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Upper Yangtze River Increases Additional Draft Surcharge <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>With the Water Level in the Upper Yangtze River Rapidly Declining, the Changsha Route has already had its Draft Surcharge Increased by 50% through Discussions by Five Companies. Yesterday, local shipping companies continued to receive telegrams indicating that the river water in Hunan Province was decreasing daily. Therefore, Taikoo and other companies have agreed that starting from the 11th of this month, the waterway transportation fee from Hankou to Changde will be increased by onefold of the original price. From Hankou to Shashi Yichang route it was agreed that, starting from the 26th of this month, the waterway transportation fee will be increased by 25% of the original price. Yesterday, all cargo owners have been notified to follow this instruction.</p>

<p>Sales Abroad More Developed Than Last Year</p>
<p>This year, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway transported boxed tea from Zhejiang Province's Quzhou, Yan, and Anhui areas, starting in May. The Huitong Forwarding Company gradually reported and loaded shipments from the Zha Kou station to Shanghai, and a special price contract was agreed upon with the railway bureau. It has been learned that this item of boxed tea has now finished transport. A total of over 182,000 boxes have been delivered to the South Station for unloading, and over 45,000 boxes have been unloaded at the North Station, a total of over 230,000 boxes. This is an increase of over 20,000 boxes compared to last year. Exports and sales of boxed tea abroad this year are also more developed than last year, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Taxpayers Association Sends a Letter to the Public Works Department to Take into Account the Difficulties of the Shack Dwellers in Eastern Shanghai <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>A Fundamental Solution Should Be Planned Before Taking Action</p>
<p>Allowing Them to Live Exposed to Snow and Frost is Contrary to Humanity</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you concerning a letter from the Shanghai East Shack Dwellers' Delegation stating that the shack dwellers along the Yangshupu roads are all famine refugees and manual laborers. Recently, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession suddenly issued notices, using the excuse of unregistered residence to forcibly demolish their homes. We have heard that this is due to the request of a small number of landlords whose houses have been neglected due to the Shanghai Incident. Moreover, registered livestock pens, such as pigsties and furniture, are also being destroyed. We have learned that these shack dwellers are both ignorant of the law and lack financial resources, and their livelihoods have been cut off, causing them great consternation. We are writing to request that you immediately submit this matter to the council, and that enforcement should not continue until the case is resolved. Furthermore, you should order your subordinates to protect those who have registered, provide guarantees to those who have registered, grant special permission for remedies to those who have not registered, and restore the demolished areas to their original state in order to maintain the livelihood of the people. We would be deeply grateful for your consideration." The representatives also personally described their suffering to the association. We have learned that unregistered shacks are indeed a violation of established regulations. However, after the Japanese army disturbed Shanghai, cheap housing was reduced to ashes, and existing businesses were unable to sustain themselves. Seeking to eke out a living, they were forced to take this step. We should overlook the circumstances and show leniency. According to the delegation, they heard that this was done at the request of the landlords. The association is confident that this is not the case. Building affordable public housing for rent would be a fundamental solution to the problem of shacks. Otherwise, if the shack dwellers are deprived of shelter from the wind and rain as we approach the depths of autumn and winter, allowing them to live exposed to snow and frost would be contrary to humanity. If you could act as requested by the delegation, the entire association would be most grateful. We are writing to request that your department investigate and take appropriate action. This is addressed to the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Public Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Dredging Bureau Iron Barge Obstructs Rice Boats <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Two Rice Industry Groups in Northern Shanghai Petition for Prohibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northern Rice Merchants United Association and the Shanghai Rice Grain Industry Association jointly submitted a petition to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, stating: "We are submitting this petition to request action. According to reports from various members, the iron barges of the Dredging Bureau, which carry mud from dredging the river channels, are extremely large and do not tow barges. When the barges navigate the Wusong River to the outer port, the barges' hulls are huge, and when sailing, the wheels are not dragged behind the ship and are attached next to the wheel, occupying about half of the total river area. The captains neglect their duties, collide straight, and do not care about anything, causing damage to rice boats and other cargo ships. The Water Patrol Team of the Public Security Bureau can do nothing about it. We request that you forward this petition to the higher authorities, severely punish the boat captains, and negotiate with the Bureau to provide a guarantee that such incidents will not occur again. Otherwise, they should be responsible for compensating for the losses. After investigation, the damaged ships are listed as follows: 1. He Guirong's rice boat was hit in the bow, and the rice was wet, losing 21 shi. 2. Zhang Bingsheng's rice boat was hit with a hole on the west side of Hengfeng Bridge. 3. Yuan Si's rice boat was hit at Hengfeng Bridge, taking in water, and losing 20-30 shi of rice. 4. Xie Wenxiang's rice boat was damaged in the bow and stern shed east of Wuzhen Bridge. 5. Fei Zixiang's rice boat was damaged by wet rice. 6. Tang Zixiang's rice boat's cable dragon board was damaged. 7. Zhangsheng's rice boat's guardrail was damaged. 8. A lime boat was hit and sunk east of Wuzhen Bridge. 9. The guard pile on the west side of Wuzhen Bridge was broken. Because the water patrol teams could not interfere, the above-mentioned damaged rice boats had to endure in silence. The Wusong River channel is not wide, and it is an area where rice boats gather, as well as a passage for other merchant ships. Now that winter is approaching, the tide is gradually falling, and the river surface is even shallower. If we don't implement strict warnings and guarantees for the future, the resulting disasters will be unimaginable. Therefore, we specially report the situation and request the (Your Bureau)(Your Association) to quickly review and transfer the situation to the Dredging Bureau for negotiation. The boat captains should be punished and guaranteed to ensure that the above-mentioned situations do not occur again. Iron barges should tow wheels behind them and should not sail side by side again. Otherwise, they should be fully liable for compensation for damages. We also pray that you will forward this letter to the Public Security Bureau, ordering the Zhabei Water Patrol Team to provide effective protection. The Public Affairs Bureau Director Wu also sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Recent News on the Telephone Negotiations for the Extra-Boundary Road Construction <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Slight Progress in Negotiations</p>
<p>Da Mei Evening News reports that the negotiations for the telephone contract for road construction beyond the boundary have reached the final stage, and the Public Concession authorities and the Shanghai Telephone Company are conducting negotiations independently. According to reliable sources, the Ministry of Communications has dispatched representatives to Shanghai to facilitate the early conclusion of the contract. The draft contract, which has been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Government, stipulates that in addition to paying 10,000 yuan annually, the company should pay the telephone bureau 12 yuan per telephone set per year as the price for obtaining the franchise in the Hongkou area. The company wants this 20 yuan to be borne by the users, but the Public Works Department, based on the telephone franchise contract, stipulates that user fees should be uniform and not discriminate. Considering that there are not many such telephone sets and that the company has great opportunities for development in the western area of Shanghai in the future, it insists that the company should bear the cost. The two sides have been discussing this back and forth for nearly two months. It is heard that there has been slight progress, and the telephone bureau may also be willing to make some concessions in exchange for other favorable conditions. It is expected that a new solution may be reported at the Public Works Department's review meeting on Thursday.</p>

<p>Removal of Registered Benefits and Bonds for Those Who Do Not Submit Certificates for Investigation</p>
<p>It is learned that the postal authorities have stated that since the promulgation and implementation of the National Government's Publication Law this spring, all newspapers and magazines published in the country should, in accordance with Article 7 of this law and its implementation rules, be submitted to the provincial and municipal governments for transfer to the Ministry of Interior for verification and issuance of registration certificates for transfer to the post office for verification. Only then can they continue to enjoy the postal convenience. The bureau issued a circular to various newspapers for compliance after receiving orders on this matter last month. However, it was found that many of the newspapers, as many as three or four hundred, had not notified the post office of their relocation, or the houses had been renovated, or they had not returned from evacuation, and it was impossible to deliver the circular. After repeated visits and investigations, there were no results. None of these newspapers have taken the initiative to send this registration certificate for verification. Therefore, the bureau will report this situation to the Directorate General of Posts after waiting for a considerable period of time as a cancellation of registration and revocation of registration benefits, and there is no other way.</p>

<p>Purely Charitable in Nature</p>
<p>The Chinese Public Hospital on Qingyun Road and Tongji Road in Zhabei has treated countless patients with diphtheria, scarlet fever, and other diseases, and it has been trusted by Chinese and foreigners alike for many years. Unfortunately, during the January 28th Incident this year, the hospital was destroyed by artillery fire, and the buildings were reduced to ashes. The hospital's operations were suspended, and those suffering from throat diseases lost a savior. Director Chen Bingqian and others, in view of this, donated funds to rebuild the new building on the original site, which is brand new. Director Chen Weihan presides over the hospital's affairs, and the facilities are complete, and the hospital continues to provide consultations. Since the beginning of autumn, throat disease has become an epidemic. As soon as the hospital uses the latest treatment methods for injections, patients are brought back to life. Moreover, the hospital is purely charitable in nature, and the poor and sick are not charged. Those who lack the funds to return home after recovery are also given travel expenses by the hospital.</p>

<p>The Riskshaw Puller is Hard to Avoid Blame</p>
<p>Li Zhangshen, an employee of the Senyuan Silk Factory in Panjiazhai, Xuxu Road, Shanghai, from Huzhou, has a son named Abao, who is four years old. As the only son and heir, he is doted on. Therefore, Li likes to keep him by his side. On the 4th of this month, Abao was playing by the roadside when Shen Sannv, a 13-year-old girl from the neighborhood, was passing by carrying boiling water. At the same time, Ding Yuncheng and Zhou Shoucheng, laborers dispatched by the Asia Petroleum Company, were pulling a rickshaw. Unexpectedly, their vehicle drove to the side of the road and knocked down Shen Sannv, causing a pot of boiling water to spill on Li Abao, scalding his abdomen and lower body. Li Zhangbao heard the news and rushed out, grabbing Ding and the others and taking them to the Second District Police Station. He also sent Abao to Guangci Hospital for treatment. However, the injuries were too severe, and he died the night before last. Yesterday, Li Zhangbao filed a complaint with the District Court, requesting an autopsy.

<h3 id="e208">Pudong Gaoqiao Police Chief's Illegal Abuse of Power Case <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Closing Arguments Concluded, Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Zheng 　, the police chief of the Fourth Sub-bureau of the Third District (Gaoqiao, Pudong) of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, was recently accused by Chen Chen and other people from the village to the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate of accepting bribes and abusing his power illegally. The prosecutor investigated and determined the facts, and filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court, requesting a public trial. The public trial was held a few days ago and was not concluded. It is now known that Zheng 　 hired Xu Heling and Wang Jian, two lawyers, to submit a defense to the Criminal Court, which can be divided into three points: ㈠ The part of the accusation of illegally punishing the monk Zhao was that on March 23rd of this year, a police officer was dispatched to patrol the countryside and learned that Zhao Dongdong's teahouse in Lingjia Wood Bridge was recruiting people to gamble. The police went to arrest them, but Zhao Heshang tipped them off, so they were not caught. Zhao was taken to the station and fined five yuan in accordance with the Prohibition and Penalty Law, as a warning, because there was gambling in the teahouse and Zhao tipped off the violators, causing them to escape. This was an administrative penalty. The police chief immediately reported to the Public Security Bureau and posted a monthly notice to inform the public. Obviously, there was no direct or indirect intention to profit, and there was no crime to speak of. The report to the Public Security Bureau also did not have any refuting instructions. The appropriateness of the punishment is undeniable, and the appropriate punishment cannot be regarded as a criminal act. The original indictment stated that he should be guilty of Article 136 of the Criminal Law, which is a misunderstanding. ㈡ The part of the accusation of illegal detention and extortion of Sun Zhangqi was that on May 10th of this year, Shen Zhangqi (that is, Sun Zhangqi) went to claim the boat with Liu Liantao and used intimidating means to forcibly demand it from Xin Zhanggen, the pond chief, and Xu Bingbing. Xin Zhanggen and Xu Bingbing brought Shen Zhangqi and Liu Liantao to the station. According to the confession, there were many discrepancies, and the license plate number could not be specified. They only claimed that the boat was rented from someone else and were ordered to submit a lease, which was delayed for several days and never submitted. Obviously, they were fraudulently claiming it, so they were submitted to the Public Security Bureau for verification on the 15th. It has been several months since then, and there is still no record of a claim. The temporary custody cannot be considered an abuse of detention. The original indictment, based on Sun Zhangqi's one-sided confession, stated that he was illegally detained for eight days and should be guilty of Article 140 and Article 316, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, which is extremely unjust. ㈢ The part of the accusation of accepting bribes from Gu Amao, Huang Jinchu, and Gao Linquan was that on March 17th of this year, the Public Security Bureau ordered an investigation into the case of Zheng Zhulin and others suing Gao Linquan and others for jointly robbing property. The patrol officer was immediately ordered to investigate secretly, but it was not the case. For the sake of caution, the police chief ordered Gu, Huang, and Gao to obtain a proper guarantee and wait for a summons. There are also guarantors Zhong Yulin, Lu Shaofeng, and Chen Xueqing who can be interrogated. Whether the police chief accepted bribes will be clear after an interrogation. However, according to the confession of Gu Amao and others in the file, a total of 200 yuan was paid. Gu Amao and Huang Jinchu each paid 67 yuan, and Gao Linquan paid 66 yuan, which Chen Jinxiu paid on their behalf. Whether this confession is true is said to be in violation of Article 129, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, which seems arbitrary. He requested a judgment of innocence. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Guan Liting continued the trial. Zheng 　 and lawyers Xu and Wang arrived in court and stated the previous situation. Then, Chen Jinxiu testified, "I guaranteed Gu Amao, but I don't know if Gu paid money." The judge ordered Gu Amao to confront him. Gu confessed that he did give Chen Jinxiu 200 yuan. The judge asked if there was any evidence, and he replied no. Then, Chen Chen and other witnesses testified. The judge ordered the start of closing arguments. Lawyers Xu Heling and Wang Jian then rose to defend for a long time. The judge ordered the closing arguments to be concluded and set the sentencing for 2 PM on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Weng Afu Commits Assault and Injury <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Sentenced to One Year and Six Months</p>
<p>Weng Afu, a Ningbo native residing at No. 506 Siwenli, Dalianwan Road, colluded with Deng Youwen (his nephew), who is at large, at 7:30 PM the day before yesterday to seek revenge on Shen Changyuan, a fellow villager at No. 3 Xiang'anli, Dongxihuade Road. They fought each other and used a kitchen knife to cut Shen's left index finger, causing him to bleed profusely and fall to the ground crying for help. Chinese detective Zhao Ruisheng heard the alarm and arrived to arrest Weng and brought him and the murder weapon to the Huishan Police Station. The head of the police ordered him to be detained. The police also sent the injured person to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police sent the prisoner Weng to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the previous situation and stated that the cause of the case was that the plaintiff Shen Changyuan's brother-in-law Wang Atong had a relationship with the defendant's nephew Deng Youwen's sister. Yesterday, Deng and the defendant went to quarrel, angered Shen Changyuan, and had a dispute. He then used a kitchen knife to cut Shen's finger. After the doctor's inspection, the index finger has been severed. Now, the victim and witness Wei Wushi have both arrived in court to testify and requested a severe punishment. Detective Zhao then reported the details of the case and presented the kitchen knife for inspection. According to the victim Shen Changyuan's complaint, he had never met the defendant before. The plaintiff's brother-in-law Wang Atong and the defendant's nephew Deng Youwen had a dispute over renting a room. Yesterday, they came to cause trouble and make a fuss. He mediated the dispute. The defendant loudly said that it would be okay to kill him. There were a total of four people on the defendant's side, each holding iron rods and sharp blades. As a result, he was cut off his index finger with a knife. The woman Wei Wushi testified that she lived with the plaintiff and that she saw the defendant cut the plaintiff's finger with a knife. Weng Afu's confession was evasive. After Judge Shen Bingrong verified the confession, he ordered the court clerk to take Shen Changyuan to the forensic doctor's office for an examination. He then sentenced Weng Afu to one year and six months of imprisonment and confiscated the murder weapon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Joint Association previously sent a letter of certification because the Star Tower brand vacuum bottles produced by the Dingxin Vacuum Bottle Factory and sold in Fujian were mistaken for Japanese goods and detained. It also informed them that the factory has always been envied by the Japanese, so during the January 28th war, the Japanese invaders destroyed almost all of its factory buildings and stoves. Now it has been rebuilt, and the goods produced are sufficient to resist Japanese goods. Yesterday, a reply was received from the Fujian National Goods Promotion Association, stating that it had proposed a motion to discuss the matter.

<p>Guo Wenbin from Tianjin and Sun Guimao from Funing, two dismissed Chinese detectives, together with an accomplice, went to the home of Xu Binglian, a Jiangbei native who ran a shoe business at No. 28 Dapu Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, in the French Concession on the evening of the 6th at 11 PM. Guo impersonated Zhou Ruiyuan, a detective from the French Concession, and Sun impersonated Bao Detective Wang Fusheng. They entered the house on the pretext of arresting people for running a lottery. They saw Xu and his friends Huang Fuyuan, Yin Yuyuan, and Ye Qingxiang playing mahjong at a table, and searched each of them, finding a total of 79 yuan in cash, banknotes, and small change, which they hid on their bodies. They also ransacked the boxes and cabinets, and took Xu out of the house on the pretext of taking him to the police station. When they arrived at the intersection of Sapo Sai Road, they released Xu. Guo and others then fled in different directions and divided the spoils. The police were notified and arrested Guo and Sun on Caishi Road the next evening. They found a wallet on Guo's body, which still contained stolen money, as well as pawn tickets for clothes and other items. They were taken to the police station and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday for investigation. First, the police lawyer Chen Ming stated the facts of the case and filed a lawsuit in accordance with Articles 166 and 337 of the Criminal Law. Then, the plaintiff Xu Binglian stated that the defendants impersonated detectives and went to his home, and seized silver dollars from everyone on the pretext of arresting people for running a lottery. The witnesses Huang Fuyuan, Yin Yuyuan, and Ye Qingxiang also testified in court, proving everything. When questioned, the two defendants categorically denied impersonating detectives and extorting money, and claimed that they were being framed out of malice. Judge Xiong verified the confession and stated that the case had been proven and could not be denied. He then sentenced Guo Wenbin and Sun Guimao to 40 days of detention each for the crime of joint intimidation and ordered the stolen money to be returned to the owner.</p>

<p>The home of Tan Chengshi, a widow residing in Tanjiazhai, Beishou, Wusong, was suddenly visited by seven bandits with painted faces on the evening before last at 11 PM. Each held a weapon and broke down the door, rushing straight into the inner room. Tan Chengshi and her daughter A Bao were awakened from their dreams. Because there were only mother and daughter in the house, they were locked in the room by the bandits. The bandits then searched at will for about half an hour. As a result, they were robbed of 75 silver dollars and three large packages of clothing and accessories. Because A Bao was getting married soon, the clothing and accessories were all newly made. After the bandits had looted their fill, they each carried the stolen goods out the door and fled west. Yesterday morning, the local bailiff Tan Songxing reported to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau and requested an arrest. After District Chief Li Jing received the report, he immediately sent district officials to investigate with police detectives. They determined that Ni Erlang, the male servant of the house, was suspicious, and took Ni to the district office for questioning. Ni claimed that he was not involved in the case, but that he knew about the bandits' plan in advance. He then confessed that the case was committed by Chu Jinsheng, Gu Axiao, Cao Gengen, Wang Heshang, and four others. After District Chief Li received the confession, he sent district officials Yin Gongtian, patrol officers Yang Xihui and Zeng Shufan, and detectives Wang Yao and Gu Yousan to secretly arrest them at their addresses. They learned that the bandits Cao Gengen and Gu Axiao were hiding in a thatch shed near Daxing'an Bridge, and they rushed in and arrested the two bandits, who did not resist. They then arrested the bandit leader Chu Jinsheng on Guizhi Road in Wusong Town, and brought them all to the district office for questioning. The three bandits all confessed to the joint robbery. District Chief Li ordered them to be detained and ordered the arrest of the four bandits who were at large for severe punishment.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Having read the news article in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 3rd of this month regarding China's new maritime accident insurance, it stated, "Furthermore, there is a seafarers' insurance company in Shanghai, which the Shipping Association planned to establish last year but failed." Upon investigation, the five member companies of our association, China Merchants, Sanbei, Ning Shao, etc., have already fully subscribed to the shares for establishing a specialized seafarers' accident insurance company in Shanghai. However, due to the decline in shipping since the September 18th Incident, it has been temporarily suspended. However, it can be formally established as soon as the opportunity arises. The statement in your newspaper that the plan "failed" is inaccurate. Therefore, we have sent this letter to request a correction, to enhance our public friendship. Sincerely, Shanghai Shipping Association, November 8th.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Xu Yulan <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Xu Yulan, a female student from Changchun, plotted to assassinate Pu Yi but was arrested after the attempt failed. Pu Yi's lack of brainpower and ambition, willingly serving as a puppet of the Japanese, certainly deserves to be bombed. It is a pity that the plot was poorly executed, leading to failure and capture.</p>
<p>However, upon closer reflection, Pu Yi is a puppet of the Japanese, or to put it more bluntly, a prisoner of the Japanese. Even if the assassination had succeeded, they could have simply chosen another puppet to take his place. Honestly speaking, success or failure is, on the whole, completely irrelevant. Even if it were intended to "kill the dog to show the monkeys," to warn the hordes of foxes and jackals who are traitors, these traitors, having lost all conscience and heart, would certainly not be moved by it. It is necessary to dissect their hearts one by one, wash them clean, or replace them entirely.</p>
<p>If that is the case, wouldn't Xu Yulan and others have sacrificed themselves in vain? No! Absolutely not. Although Xu Yulan's attempt failed, her spirit, her enthusiasm, her loyalty, and her courage cannot be erased. It is evident that not all Chinese people are like those shameless traitors who can be bought with money or enticed with benefits. There are still people with hearts who have not died, like the volunteer soldiers who fight the Japanese in the bitter cold of Manchuria, risking their lives to fight for the survival of our nation. If they could receive support from Xu Yulan and others, echoing each other from afar, it would be enough to boost their morale and strengthen their resolve to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>Women were originally playthings of men, unable to do things for the country, and to go even further, even despised by humanity. But what about Xu Yulan? Not only should the general male traitors feel ashamed of themselves, but also those within the country who bear the responsibility of defending the territory and shouldering the heavy burden of the nation, I wonder what they think of Xu Yulan's plot to assassinate Pu Yi.</p>

<p>— Yi Ru</p>
<p>The autumn wind came boundless last night, entering the tip of the brush, giving birth to clouds and mist. The imagery flies in this foot-wide painting, mountains and trees all falling before me. The slanting sun faintly illuminates the desolate grass, a flock of geese startled by the cold comes on the ancient road. Leaves, green before, turn red after the frost, embellishing the autumn scene, not yet old. I further suspect that a scenic spot is in the river ahead, where a guest is setting sail, the white seagulls trying to vie with the man for a seat, rising and falling in the waves, how gracefully. How could I not think of Zhang Han and the perch and water shield? How vast is this autumn scenery! The mountain's meaning contains emotion, as if awaiting me, I am ashamed to be at my desk all day, unable to take a trip at will. I can only indulge in appreciating this painting, as if placing myself in the scene, lingering and halting, bringing forth sorrowful winds. Sorrow comes, my interest ends, I raise my sleeves and lean against the railing, gazing remotely at the sky.</p>

<h3 id="e231">Vinegar <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Zu Tong</p>
<p>Principle of Vinegar Brewing: Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic acid in water, usually containing about 4-10% acetic acid. When wine is invaded by acetic acid bacteria, it turns sour. However, these bacteria cannot reproduce in a pure solution of alcohol and must have nitrogenous substances and salts as their nutrients. Therefore, vinegar making starts with fruit wine, malt beer, wine mash, etc., containing about 6-7% alcohol. After acidification, the alcohol is converted to acetic acid, with the following chemical equation:</p>
<p>C2H5OH + O2 ↓ CH3COOH + H2O</p>
<p>Alcohol Acetic Acid</p>
<p>At the same time, other compounds are formed, with acetaldehyde being the most abundant, which is an intermediate product of alcohol oxidation to acetic acid.</p>
<p>C2H5OH + O ↓ CH3CHO + H2O</p>
<p>Acetaldehyde</p>
<p>Large-Scale Vinegar Brewing: Large-scale vinegar making equipment consists of wooden barrels with perforated false bottoms, on which a thick layer of wood chips is spread. The sides of the barrels are perforated to allow air to enter. The wine is added through a funnel on top and falls onto a rotating disk, dividing into wine flowers, which are sprinkled on the thick layer of wood chips. The acetic acid bacteria rapidly multiply on the wood chips, generating heat, which then oxidizes the passing wine into vinegar. The optimum temperature for acetic acid bacteria reproduction is 40-43 degrees. The vinegar must be stored for several days or months to develop a fragrant aroma, and then filtered with sand. The resulting vinegar contains 6% acetic acid and can be diluted. British "Number 24 vinegar" contains 5.5% acid. Even weaker ones are Numbers 22, 20, 18, and 16. Number 16 contains only 4.1% acetic acid. Vinegar made by diluting acetic acid and adding caramel for color is cheap imitation vinegar.</p>
<p>Shanxi Vinegar Brewing Method: Peas and barley are used as the raw materials for the flour, sometimes with red or black beans added to obtain color. Production is most suitable during the summer. The method uses 65 parts barley, 30 parts peas, and 5 parts red or black beans. Grind finely, add the appropriate amount of water—too dry makes it difficult to grow mold, and too wet makes it difficult to form a mold. Mix well and place in a wooden mold.</p>
<p>Press into a cake shape. Take it out and place it on sorghum stalks or wheat straws, arranged in rows on the ground, surrounded by mugwort, and covered with two layers of paper or wheat straws. Seal the windows and doors tightly. After about two or three days, it will generate heat, and white-green spots will appear on the surface, which is called "Shangmei" (growing mold). If it cannot grow mold by the due date, water should be sprinkled on the cake to moisten it, and the windows and doors should still be covered tightly, making sure that it grows mold. After the mold grows, open the windows for ventilation. After three or four hours, close the windows again, and turn it over once or twice a day. After two weeks, the koji (fermented starter) is formed. Place it in the open air to dry. At this time, if the koji is crushed, the inside will appear red-yellow in color. Each cake weighs about two jin.</p>
<p>The raw materials for the vinegar are yellow millet and sorghum, with 60 parts millet and 20 parts sorghum, respectively cooked with water until they become porridge. Mix them into a vat. After it has completely cooled, add 20 parts koji, stir evenly, and cover with grass. Stir it once a day. At first, the porridge is thick; after seven or eight days, it gradually becomes thinner. After one month, the vinegar slurry is formed. Mix in millet chaff, and rub it evenly with water, not too dry and not too wet. If it is too dry, it is easy to dry out; if it is too wet, it is difficult to generate heat. After rubbing evenly, mix it into a vat and cover it with grass, surrounding it with grass. At this time, the temperature in the house should be around 30 degrees. After seven days, the upper layer of the residue in the vat will generate heat, about three inches thick. Use your hands to move it up and down and rub it. After it gradually cools, cover it again. When the heated layer thickens to five inches, use your hands to move it up and down and rub it again. After that, the heated layer gradually deepens every day and is rubbed every day until the heat reaches the bottom of the vat. Then, rub it once a day for more than ten days, and the residue is formed. After the residue is formed, add it into the vat, which has a hole plugged with a reed pipe, and add water to leach it. However, when adding water, be sure to plug the pipe opening for about an hour to prevent mixing. Place the leached vinegar outside, freeze it in winter, discard the ice and keep the liquid, until the vinegar liquid no longer freezes. Then the vinegar gradually thickens. Then, put it in a closed urn and store it for one or two years before eating. The older it is, the better.</p>

<p>— Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>One deep autumn evening, a fashionable young woman stood at a gazebo in the park. Tourists had gradually left, and she was still in the gazebo, looking towards the park gate. She muttered to herself:</p>
<p>(Young Woman) Why hasn't he arrived yet? He has never broken an appointment before! Could it be that he has guessed my hidden intention, knowing that I want to break up with him, and is deliberately avoiding me?! Let's go! What's the point of standing here waiting for him like a fool?</p>
<p>As she said this, she was about to walk away when a young man hurried into the park from outside. As soon as the young man entered the park gate, he stopped and looked around, searching. So she called out first:</p>
<p>(Young Woman) Brother Kai, I'm here! I've been waiting for you for a long time!</p>
<p>Hearing this, the young man immediately strode forward, intending to shake her hand, but she refused.</p>
<p>(Young Man) (With a smile) Oh, Sister Mo, are you perhaps blaming me for being late? I've been really busy these past two days. Just now, I was drafting a notice that had to be sent to the newspaper office before six o'clock, so it was delayed for a long time, making my sister wait here. I'm really uneasy! But since my sister is not an outsider, I think she can forgive me!</p>
<p>(Young Woman) (Shaking her head and sighing) There's no need to say a thousand words or ten thousand sentences. In short, we can only have a friendship relationship from now on! I'm asking you here now, just to break off our engagement!</p>
<p>(Young Man) (His face changed immediately) Sister, what are you talking about? You don't have any obstacles, and I haven't changed my mind in the slightest. What exactly is your hidden reason? Please tell me clearly!</p>
<p>(Young Woman) Alas! You should know that my love is only given to two. One is the country, and the other is you. But love for the country is even more important than love for you. I can't let myself love you and not love the country now!</p>
<p>(Young Man) Sister, what are you referring to by saying that?</p>
<p>If it's really the truth, then I will definitely allow you to fulfill your patriotic ambition!</p>
<p>(Young Woman) Do you even need to ask me this? Your father willingly serves as a traitorous merchant, selling goods from the enemy, regardless of the condemnation of the people. The anti-traitor groups warned him in vain, and the Chamber of Commerce persuaded him without effect. These past few days, the students have been mocking me, saying that I'm the daughter-in-law of a traitorous merchant. You think, I can endure them calling me a cat or a dog; but how can I bear it when they say that I have a relationship with a traitor? Alas, Brother Kai, you must forgive my forced difficulty and allow my request so that you can eliminate the pain in my conscience.</p>
<p>(Young Man) (Laughing loudly) So that's it! So that's it!······</p>
<p>(Young Woman) (Angrily) Do you willingly want to divorce me? Have you also been infected by your father? Alas!·····</p>
<p>(Young Man) You don't know yet, I have already broken off relations with my father. The notice I just drafted can be published in the newspapers tomorrow! You love the country, how can I not love the country? I only regret that I don't have a pistol, otherwise, I would have performed the "Righteous Extermination of Kin" story long ago, and shot him dead! Originally, I had long ago made the determination to break away from him, but the economic problem of studying had not been resolved. Now that all the necessary measures have been planned, what else is there to worry about?······</p>
<p>(Young Woman) (Changing from resentment to joy) Oh, Brother Kai, really?········</p>
<p>As she spoke, she nestled into his arms, and he gave her a sweet long kiss: their consciences were filled with an unspeakable joy.</p>

<h3 id="e233">A Suggestion to Abolish Conventional Polite Writing  by Buddhist <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Indeed, we Chinese are the most particular about etiquette. Just look at the exchanges in letters, with terms like "at your knee," "before your honorable presence," "your esteemed self," "your blessed health," "your distinguished footsteps," "your illustrious bearing," and so on. They are expressed with the utmost politeness and humility. But in reality, disciples may not understand principles, and friends may not keep their word. At the slightest disagreement, they turn against each other without mercy. At critical junctures involving self-interest, they are fiercely competitive. Reading their usual correspondence, it's as if they are completely different people. What is the reason for this? Perhaps it is the deeply rooted "hypocrisy" of us Chinese.</p>
<p>Speaking of conventional polite writing, such as birthday prefaces, memorial essays, congratulatory poems, funeral couplets, epitaphs, eulogies, biographies, obituary notices, as well as all sorts of ceremonial banners and inscriptions on silver shields, none of them are without utter nonsense and hypocrisy. Clearly, the person has no noteworthy deeds or commendable virtues, yet they are described in extravagant terms, making them seem worthy of tears and songs. Isn't this also the deeply rooted "hypocrisy" of us Chinese?</p>
<p>Originally, eulogistic tomb inscriptions were already prevalent in the Tang Dynasty. However, congratulatory writings for living people have a shorter history. Therefore, Gui Zhuang stated in his birthday preface that such matters are not ancient practices. Yet, flattering the living is already ridiculous, and flattering the dead is even more so. In ancient times, there were only farewell prefaces, which often contained words of encouragement. Nowadays, people only know how to flatter or boast about themselves, which is completely different from the intentions of the ancients.</p>
<p>There is now a type of scholar who specializes in flattering the living and the dead for a living, and they even claim to be very refined. A birthday preface costs one hundred yuan, and a funeral poem thirty yuan. They sell their writing for a living, preferring not to become officials. Perhaps they are former historians, academicians, or remnants of the Qing Dynasty. Think about it: isn't writing a birthday preface saying that someone has "lived a long and fulfilling life"? Isn't writing a funeral poem lamenting that someone is a "sage withered" or has "returned to the celestial palace"? Friends who make a living by sweet-talking must come to offer flattering words whenever they encounter social gatherings. Servants must also say nice things when their masters have celebrations in order to receive rewards. Then, what is the difference between these great literary figures who sell their writing to praise others for financial gain and those who make a living by sweet-talking or serving as maids and servants? In the decoration shop, I saw a name book of great literary figures, tall enough to hide a person, and I thought about how prosperous their business must be, much better than us literary beggars who submit articles.</p>
<p>Speaking of those who receive such meaningless congratulatory writings, they should not take flattery as interesting or ridicule as honor. For the same old congratulatory and commemorative texts, one might as well buy a "Social Handbook" and copy a few articles. Why spend so much money to consult these boring hermetic literary figures? Moreover, if the name does not match the reality, it is very shameful to receive it. However, it is also unnecessary to send such boring and formulaic articles to others. If you are a wealthy person and send someone a piece of venomous writing, they will cherish it as if it were a treasure. If you are an unknown person, no matter how well you write, even if the wealthy person's hall is large, your work will not even have a place to lean against the wall. Therefore, I have a habit of never sending congratulatory writings to others, nor do I want to ask so-called famous literary figures to write a word or an article. If the matter is truly worthy of commemoration, you might as well ask a few close friends who truly understand you to sign their names in a booklet, which can indeed be kept as a souvenir. I wonder what the editor and readers of this column think?</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3 id="e234">Speaking Foreign Languages is Beneficial <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Foreigners learn the languages and writings of other countries as tools for studying the cultures and academics of those countries. Therefore, we only see them burying their heads in their studies. Only the citizens of Great China learn foreign languages as a means of livelihood. Therefore, we only see them working diligently with their mouths in a beautiful way. Someone said: "The people of semi-colonies cannot become compradores for foreigners in foreign firms if they cannot speak beautiful foreign languages. Of course, they cannot make a fortune from foreign countries, live in foreign houses, and enjoy foreign blessings..."</p>
<p>Speaking foreign languages to make a living is a unique and original iron rice bowl in your esteemed country, setting a new record unprecedented and unsurpassed!</p>
<p>X X X</p>
<p>Modern men and women, whether giving speeches or chatting, love to interject a word or two, or a sentence or two, of foreign languages. Some people say that this is very fashionable. Once, I asked a friend who always likes to interject foreign languages why he does this. He said: "Sometimes it is difficult to express myself in Chinese, sometimes I cannot think of appropriate Chinese words, and sometimes it is faster to think in English..."</p>
<p>If interjecting foreign languages is fashionable and showing off, then it is understandable, because that is his freedom. But if it is true that "Chinese people find it difficult to express themselves in Chinese and think slowly," then I must doubt what the teacher told me on the platform: "A five-thousand-year-old ancient country, the only land of culture." If this history book were in my hands, I would tear it to pieces and ask it why it deceived me! How dare it speak so brazenly without shame?!</p>
<p>Humorous Drama</p>
<h3 id="e235">"A Scene from a Martial Drama" by a Friend <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>In Shanghai, stores with larger scopes are always double-fronted, while those with smaller scopes are single-fronted. Everyone knows this, but no one has ever used "single-fronted" or "double-fronted" to describe people! Except for Mr. C.</p>
<p>My old friend Mr. C is one of the most humorous and sarcastic among my friends. He often finds shortcomings in others to create "nicknames." His colleague Mr. Y has dark skin, so he calls him "Annamite Police Officer." Old Xu likes to dress up, so he calls him "Rabbit"... In short, he fairly creates a nickname for each of you.</p>
<p>Because of his ability to create amusement, he staged the following martial drama, which may be his retribution!</p>
<p>The incident happened the day before yesterday afternoon. The plot is as follows: Many paintings and calligraphy are hanging on the walls of the parlor, with several tables and benches scattered on both sides. Four people are sitting around a square table, busily playing mahjong. On the left is Mr. H, and below Mr. H is Mr. C, who specializes in making fun of others. Mr. H plays very aggressively and is reluctant to let the player below him take any tiles. Mr. C has lost seven or eight yuan and is naturally angry. He wants to find a shortcoming in Mr. H to vent his anger.</p>
<p>It turns out that Mr. H lost sight in one of his eyes when he was young, becoming one-eyed. So Mr. C's opportunity for revenge has come.</p>
<p>"One-Eyed Mr.! Why can't I take any of the tiles you discard?" Mr. C asked Mr. H with a sarcastic face.</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Why do you call him One-Eyed Mr.?" someone sitting opposite Mr. C interjected.</p>
<p>"Doesn't he have one eye missing? Isn't 'missing eye' spelled 'One-Eyed' Mr.!" After his clear explanation, everyone burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Mr. H blushed, glaring with his one eye.</p>
<p>The sound of mahjong tiles continued for an hour or two. Mr. C still rarely took tiles from his above player Mr. H and was very resentful. He gave Mr. H another nickname—Single-Fronted.</p>
<p>"If 'Single-Fronted' lets me take a '3-wan' on the edge, my '4-7 wan' pure suit would have won long ago!" Mr. C said, smiling at the other two players.</p>
<p>"What a 'Single-Fronted' nickname! It's both unique and appropriate. Haha..."</p>
<p>"Say 'Single-Fronted' again if you dare," Mr. H said, his anger rising.</p>
<p>"I insist on saying 'Single-Fronted,' what are you going to do?" Mr. H threw a punch. Mr. C was not willing to show weakness and immediately stood up and punched back. Then, the two twisted together. At the same time, the sound of disordered footsteps, chairs falling to the ground, and mouths shouting "Come on! Come on!" all mixed together. The other two players had an inescapable duty to mediate between the two sides, but it was still ineffective. After the two of them used force to pull them apart, each finally stopped. As a result, Mr. C's face had several more finger marks, and "Single-Fronted" Mr. H tore a long gown. A scene from a martial drama finally came to an end, and the sound of mahjong tiles also stopped!</p>

<h3 id="e236">Japanese War Films <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Based on "The Recent Stage of Japanese Films" by Gan Yu</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" and "January 28th" Incidents, Japan has produced many war films. Because "many tragic pieces of information for upholding the interests of the Manchurian Empire were promoted in the newspapers every day" (original wording; same below). "The noble sacrifice of the Three Brave Soldiers with Explosives, the military exploits of the Four Brave Soldiers as Human Pillars, and the feudal samurai-style devotion of Commander Koga, were all enough to shock the hearts of the Japanese people. Therefore, Japanese war films were built on these facts (?)." "Among them, the Manchurian March of the Shochiku Film Company is considered the best."</p>
<p>In this film, there are many "depictions of post-war life." On the other hand, other war films mostly depict the brave Japanese army and the enemy's revolt from beginning to end. This film focuses on the suffering of the Japanese people after the war.</p>
<p>In addition, there is Nikkatsu's "Great Aerial Attack," which, like Hiroshi Shimizu's "Army Great March," aims to provide the audience with historical knowledge and a belief in worshiping heroes, a dry and uninteresting work.</p>
<p>With the Shanghai Incident as its background, there is "Three Brave Soldiers with Explosives." In this film, "there is the appearance of Shanghai just before the war, with many anti-Japanese crowds shouting to defeat the Japanese and Japanese monks suffering tragic murders by the Chinese." "Whether these facts are true, we do not know." However, "they are the reason for Japan's dispatch of troops. As to whether this reason is proper, we cannot say. However, explaining the reason why the war occurred is very important in the structure of the film."</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Japanese war films have completed the task of military and national education. Moreover, with the close guidance of the military, these films can become tools for propaganda and agitation by the Japanese rulers.</p>

<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e238">Review of "Blonde Venus" <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Garbo has left us, but we can comfort ourselves with Marlene Dietrich, whose impressions in "The Blue Angel" and "Morocco" were very unsettling.</p>
<p>Today, "Blonde Venus," which is being shown simultaneously at the Grand and Nanking Theatres, gives people a further understanding of her. Marlene is indeed advancing on the path of art. She performs very considerately: she can make the plot even more tense with silence.</p>
<p>The supporting roles are some new characters, all of whom are not bad. The child who plays Dietrich's son, Dickid Moore, is worthy of attention. His innocent and lively performance adds a lot of color to the film and can truly be compared with David Lee.</p>
<p>The director was originally a famous figure in continental Europe. He can use miraculous means to make this film so moving! In many places, he uses indirect and subtle descriptions. The whole film focuses on small details. This brilliance should of course be attributed to him.</p>
<p>The plot could not be more ordinary. If you read the synopsis of this film, you will definitely not believe that such a good film could come from such an ordinary story, but the fact is often not the case.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to say a few words. At the first show yesterday at the Grand Theatre, only one reel of charcoal drawing was shown first, and then there was a break. After the break, the main feature was shown. When the first reel was finished, there was another two-minute pause, and more than half of the second reel became silent. This is probably because the two theaters are showing it at the same time and are busy. I think it would be better for the two theaters to show the same film at three o'clock and three fifteen, otherwise, this kind of problem will often occur.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Wang Yuanlong Upholds Justice <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong in the film industry is known for his bold and generous nature and his admirable sense of justice. Recently, due to the persuasion of Mr. Logan, he decided to join the United Film Company. Rumor has it that a group of people with no way out are asking him for help morning and night. He should have gone to Hong Kong earlier, but he has been delayed repeatedly because this matter has not been resolved. However, Mr. Logan's urging has come in the form of flying telegrams, so Yuanlong has to leave early.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Zi Luolan Returns to Her Old Profession <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Ms. Zi Luolan is famous for her graceful dance and clear voice. Since joining the screen, she has had two works, "Silver River Double Star" and "Overseas Cuckoo Soul." Although the results were not very outstanding, they were still welcomed by some. We fully hoped that she would move forward on the path of strength to seek further education. However, before long, she was hired by Mr. Long, a wealthy household in Hong Kong, who hid her in a golden house, causing her to leave her screen career.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, news came that Ms. Zi and Mr. Long had divorced due to disagreements. Therefore, Zi Luolan decided to make a comeback and return to the film industry. She is now being introduced by a certain gentleman, and it will definitely become a reality in the near future. The company set is still the United Film Company's second production studio.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Wang Hanlun Joins Zhonghua <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Xi Yang (Naimé) and Xuan (Jinglin) have made comebacks one after another. A group of old-fashioned stars who have stepped down are quite interested in growing their thighs again and returning to their old professions. Therefore, Zhang Zhiyun followed, re-entering Mingxing. However, news came that Wang Hanlun, an old-fashioned female star in the Chinese film industry twelve years ago, will also return to the silver screen.</p>
<p>According to reports, since Wang retired from the silver screen, she has engaged in the emerging business of beauty salons. For several years, groups have invited her, but Wang Hanlun's conditions have always been so harsh that those who came to hire her were discouraged. Now that Wen Zongyao is organizing the Zhonghua Film Industry Company, he is now collecting talents, and Wang Hanlun is also among those recruited. The two sides have been in progress for a long time, and now all the conditions have been understood. The term is one year, and the monthly salary is four hundred foreign dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Tang Tianxi is in Decline <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Zhong</p>
<p>Ms. Tang Tianxi has been in the film industry for a long time, and her performance art is quite commendable. Moreover, she has an upward heart, and she is constantly thinking about striving for progress. She has gone directly up to support the ambition as the protagonist from an extra.</p>
<p>Wang Yuanlong's younger brother, Cilong, directed films when he was affiliated with the United Film Company, all starring Tianxi. Now that Cilong has left, Ms. has lost her golden time. In Sun Yu's "Volcanic Love Blood," she only played a supporting role that had nothing to do with the overall situation. Looking back at the past, Tang Tianxi has a sense of vicissitudes.</p>

<h3 id="e244">True Stars are Not Afraid of Many People <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Stars who only believe in the power of heaven and not in their own abilities, stars who call themselves geniuses and despise newcomers, may be right in what they believe. Because they know that they have no ability, those who are called stars by fluke are just accidental fates. Therefore, they openly admit that they have no ability except to rely on heaven for food. The more stars like this, the farther the performing arts on the screen are from brightness. Fortunately, now in the Chinese film industry, only some of the so-called stars think this way, and the Chinese film industry is not completely buried in darkness.</p>
<p>In the future, those who are called "stars" will not be as easy as they are now. Those who enjoy the glory of stars today, if after five years, they still only rely on the power of heaven, still only rely on support, and do not add a little of their own unique skills, thinking of ways to compete and win in the performing arts, I dare say that he will not be embarrassed to be called a star anymore.</p>
<p>A true star with artistic cultivation will never be afraid of too many people. Not only will they not be afraid of many in the young Chinese film industry, but even the old-fashioned film industry in the United States often feels a lack of it! The only reason why the Chinese film industry's progress is slow and why it is laughed at by a group of friends who love to watch imported films is because most of those stars have not had the opportunity to receive artistic cultivation or how to cultivate themselves. And they have already hung up the sign of stars. If the film industry does not stop competing and progressing, the film industry will never dislike too many stars with artistic cultivation.</p>
<p>Film Common Sense</p>
<h3 id="e245">Beauty | Not Necessary for Stars <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Ziyin</p>
<p>When people talk about the success of female stars, they always think that beauty is the only factor. In fact, this concept is wrong, and on the contrary, we can even say that beauty is not necessary for a female star. Perhaps some roles require beauty, but beauty alone cannot create success on the screen.</p>
<p>What the camera is looking for is important expressions and a good inner performance. Even if you have a good-looking face, it is equal to a clay sculpture, and there is no use at all. Even in ordinary social interactions, a female friend who is good at expressing herself is most popular with the public, and on the screen, these expressions, in addition to making people feel happy, also have a greater task for the plot. There are many girls who are for their beauty, there are several guarantees, and they come from afar, among these many beautiful women, which director will choose, and how can those stars who are already famous and not very beautiful, such as Garbo, stand out among these many beauties.</p>
<p>This is the importance of expression, just say Garbo, | to be precise, she can't be counted as a beauty, but what she lacks is made up by her talent, so she still wins the love of most audiences.</p>
<p>Anna Sten, the Russian actress who recently joined Hollywood, is in the same situation. If Ms. Stan is placed among a group of professional women, no one will notice her, but on the screen, her sincere performance allows her to occupy a seat among the red stars.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford cannot stand out in the Caimai Conference, but her art makes her more attractive than the average sensual girl wearing a thin bathing suit. Ruth Chaton also had a smooth journey in the film industry because of the magic of her personality.</p>
<p>To say the most ugly old woman, Helen Hayes, she has been good at acting as a notorious old woman all her life. She is really "sea dragon alive". Her success, in addition to her skills in acting, can be said to be unrelated to the word "beauty".</p>
<p>Because of examples in all aspects, we can draw a conclusion that what a star needs is not just beauty.</p>

<h3 id="e246">About the United Film Company's First Studio <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>The director of the United Film Company's First Studio, Bu Wancang, can be regarded as an outstanding director in the Chinese film industry. In the past, he supported the United Film Company's First Studio alone and produced many valuable films. However, because Lao Bu was singing a one-man show, no matter how hard he worked, the output was always slower than other companies. The United Film Company's authorities were aware of this, and they also wanted to find a new and bright path for Chinese films, so they successively hired Fei Mu and Jiang Qifeng a month ago to co-star in a three-man show with Lao Bu. From then on, the output of the United Film Company's First Studio may be expected to be faster and more.</p>

<p>| is one of Elyssa Reith's trilogy |</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, our Elyssa Reith, the female succeeded in a symphony interwoven with laughter and tears, the song is playing her beauty in the same way, giving full play to her fortitude personality, it is a very fragrant and delicious taste! Indeed, the name of this taste is called "Living Hell"!</p>
<p>Elyssa Reith in "Living Hell" made the masses in front of the screen feel infinite threats, threatening them to sympathize with her to the death, even worship her, every move of hers is like people bathing in the warmth of spring, and at the same time making people fall into the coldness of winter snow, ah! I don't feel that she is stretching her graceful expression in front of Camilla, I directly feel that she is teasing her own "life" on the stage of life.</p>
<p>Friends who went to visit her new work "Living Hell" all said that Elyssa Reith is the proud child of the times, and her expression on the screen directly chases the mysterious female Lang Greta Garbo, but we can't forget the director Frank Lau, and the supporting roles Paul Lucas, Luo Lai Xianeng, and Alexander Ke Lai, etc., green tender leaves, set off her bright flowers.</p>
<p>Here, I will crown her. If you have all appreciated her "Yellow License" and "Girl in Room Thirteen" and feel satisfied, then this "Living Hell" is a delicious song in her trilogy.</p>

<h3 id="e248">On the Trend of Soviet Films in the Past Fifteen Years (Continued) <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>| According to Harry Alan Potamkin's opinion |</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the film "Golden Mountain," I have to discuss it generally here. No matter whether this film is extremely good or the worst, that is not very important. The main thing is that this film will make the Soviet film route even more difficult. Eisenstein said when he was in the United States before returning to the Soviet Union that he doubted whether films could implement the nature of "concrete evidence." He believed that films were best suited to "general statements." These general statements are "relatively easy," just as melodrama is relatively easy, but not better. The better should be more complete. "Golden Mountain" shows that it is a more complete film. In this film, there are all kinds of inner thoughts and social groups, the inner battles and changes of one person. This is not something that happened in 1914 or 1941, but is exactly what is happening now. Now the experience of the proletarian revolution is proving this fact in the dialectical understanding. This kind of film is not sudden, and its own is a result of dialectics. In many Soviet films, we see the development of the plot reaching its peak, and the protagonist's psychological changes, understanding, and opinions cannot avoid being rigid, such as "The End of St. Petersburg," such as "Storm Over Asia" (it was released in Shanghai at the Baixing Theatre, the film name is not a direct translation, it seems to have been changed to something like "National Soul," not only was the film cut, but at the end, a party flag of the Chinese Kuomintang was added, and I heard that the film merchant deceived the review with the name "German production" and started screening after being modified), such as "A Fragment of the Empire," etc. The above three films, especially the first two, the depiction of mass events is mechanically caught in a kind of overpowering development, or it is made into a kind of concentration of individuals separated from the mass meaning. These phenomena are gone in today's Soviet films. (End)</p>
