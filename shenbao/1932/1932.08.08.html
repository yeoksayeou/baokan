<h3 id="c1">國際經濟會議　微· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>由洛桑會議中英國所提議召集之國際經濟會議。今已在正式籌備之中。開不久將發請書。分致担任籌備委員之各國代表。除英國外計有美法德意日比挪威七國。請其即日會齊。進行籌備工作。此會或將稱爲世界通幣與金融會議。地點定在倫敦。日期則俟美國十一月總統選舉以後再行决定我國及其他各國。均將被邀參加。此會爲繼洛桑會議之後。謀解除世界經濟恐慌之一重要會議。其前途如何。關係至巨。爲吾人所當深加注意者也。</p>
<p>此次全世界之經濟恐慌。發生於一九二九年。其發生之原因學者意見頗多。但主要者大體不外三種。一由於賠償與戰債問題之糾紛。二由於英國失去其指導調節世界經濟之地位。以致世界金融市塲。陷於紊亂狀態。三則由於各國各自收縮通幣。壓低物價。抬高利率。因物價之低落而致國際間所有債務關係。難以履行。故欲解除世界經濟恐慌。自須審考此三種原因而謀適當之對策。洛桑會議之召集。即期對第一種原因有所解救。今者已獲得相當之成效。不待重述。而籌備中之國際經濟會議。則又爲對於第二第三二種原因而致力者也。</p>
<p>何以言英國失去其指導調節世界經濟之地位。蓋英國在世界戰事以前爲經濟力最强大之國家。借給他國之長期短期資金。爲數甚巨如外國金融發生恐慌。僅須英蘭銀行减低利率。即有大宗資金流往外國。反之。外國金融過於寬裕。則英蘭銀行增高利率。使資金復歸。以此而維持世界金融之平衡焉。</p>
<p>然而大戰以後。英國之經濟界感受極大之困難。前之向外國貸欵者。今反向外國借入。産業方面又遭美國之勁敵。而有减衰之傾向。完全喪失其調節世界金融之能力。於此時也。世界金融發生恐慌。即莫能爲之補救者矣。　　復次。自一九二五年英國回復金本位以來。世界各國亦莫不先後回復。且爲維持其金本位及防止現金之流向美法二國計。又各收縮通幣抬高利率。壓低物價。然而物價低落。則於履行國際債務。即感困難。何以言之。蓋國際債務之履行。雖由於現欵之支付。但付欵之來源。仍須取之於輸出之貨品。物價减低。則輸出貨口即須加多。輸出品加多。即不能不與他國商品競爭而更抑低其價値。德國賠欵支付之無法履行。此即其重要之原因也。（現各國因經濟恐慌之故。仍先後停止金本位以謀抬高物價。）</p>
<p>是故國際經濟會議之所討論者。即爲如何可以重整調節金融之方法。及如何可以抬高物價之二事。據國際聯盟金委員會之少數意見。則主張改金本位爲紙幣本位。而以世界各國代表。組織共同機關。任調節金融之責一如戰前英國所行之方法。然有一部分人。則以爲金本位仍當採用。此通幣問題即爲將來會議中所亟待討論者。</p>
<p>至於經濟會議之前途如何。吾人在今日會議尙在籌備之際似無詳加猜測之必要。惟吾人有不能已於言者。即希望各國勿以政治的原因牽入經濟的討論範圍是已。夫世界各國就其政治疆域而言。固均分離而獨。立然就其經濟關係而言。則實互相連屬成爲一體。設有一國。其經濟狀况發生變動。則其影響往往足以波及於全世界而莫能制止。此觀於最近經濟恐慌。全世界各國無一得以倖免面可知者。獨惜世界各國之政治家。往往未能深解此理。强欲以改治的疆域。限止經濟的擾動。如提高關稅壁壘。保獲本國市塲。即此種心理之表現。又如强制德國負担巨額之賠欵。及美國不允爲協約國减輕戰債。史含有政治的意味。此種行爲。不特於本國經濟情形毫無裨益。且其結果。反足以使世界經濟愈形紊亂。今賠欵與戰債問題。幸得洛桑會議爲之解决。故吾人復希望各國。能仍秉洛桑會議之精神。以臨將來之國際經濟會議。</p>

<p>▲七局結果中華十比七勝</p>
<p>▲表演精彩興味十分濃厚</p>
<p>中華棒球隊與麥令斯乙組之友誼比賽、前兩次均歸麥令勝利、中華隊經此挫折之後、力圖振作、冀獲佳良結果、昨日第三次戰、果然得償所願、中華隊以十比七獲勝、此爲中華隊成立後初次傑作、各球員無不精神踴躍、喜形於色、長此以往、殊可樂觀、茲記經過如下、</p>
<p>▲中華旗開得勝　下午三時半、棒球塲看台上、已列满四五百觀衆、中華先攻開始、梁澄松一擊成功、球向中塲飛去、進至三壘、李北良繼之、因對方之失誤、梁生還、李達二壘、以後被殺二人、但張兆元梁扶初張國勛仍力謀進展、盡佔各壘、形勢殊佳、不料魏宗鏜擊球、球被麥令投手接住、送之本壘、李北艮被封殺、全局變化、中華於此形勢下、僅獲一分、惜哉、中華乃改守陣、麥令打擊、一無所取、</p>
<p>▲麥令奇鋒突起　第二局中華再攻、安樂生豋塲、球擊未遠、但麥令游擊失誤、安幸達二壘、金鎭東李文煊助之、安乃生還、得一分、換陣後、麥令鋒芒殊盛、迭創安打、弗利門四球得壘、勒發打出遠球、向右塲飛過鉛絲綱、爲三壘打、弗利門乃生還、入後麥令每擊必中、聲勢極盛、瑪倫·勃塞爾與李氏、先後生還、總計麥令共得四分、中華反以二比四落後、</p>
<p>▲第三局之傑作　第三局上、雙方各有傑作、中華先攻、梁扶初安打得壘、梁澄松壘、魏宗鏜建犧牲打、澄松急返、得一分、國勛渡至二壘、金鎭東擊出遠球、向左塲飛去、爲安打、國勛亦生還、李文煊急球打出右塲、金鎭東至三壘、旋乘麥令之錯誤、而歸本壘澄松又得安打、李文煊亦生還、李北良安打、球穿出右中塲間、不易接得、澄松遂亦奔歸、共得五分、換陣後、麥令受此大挫、積極反攻、勒發打出中塲、中塲員失誤、二三壘之納布爾及弗利門各生還、後瑪倫安打、勒發亦歸、而得三分、總計前三局之結果、成七與七之比</p>
<p>▲第四五局各零　第四局中華二人被殺後、曾於一線希望中、佈满勢力於各壘、卒未出安打而抛棄、是局麥令亦無所得、第五局中華零、麥令力攻、中華憑各個奮興之精神、力殺三人、妙而容易</p>
<p>▲中華再增兩分第六局上、魏宗鏜先打得壘、由李北良代跑、案樂生繼之、擊出之球、雖不甚遠、因右場之失誤而至二壘、李文煊力振、李北良奔回被封殺、梁扶初創安打、安與李生還、梁至三壘下塲、麥令主打、又被中華連殺三人、極迅捷美妙之至、</p>
<p>▲麥令苦戰失敗　中華張兆元張國勛先後得壘、魏宗鏜又抱犧牲主義、輕輕觸球、張兆元急歸本壘、加一分、換塲後、麥令再接再厲、作最後之努力、雖曾進至二壘上、卒被中華殺之、結果中華以十比七獲勝、是戰中、中華共得安打十五記、麥令爲十記、錯誤麥令達十一次之多、中華僅三次耳、茲錄二隊得分安打及線陣如下、</p>
<p>安打　一　一五　二二二二—十五　▲中華　一一五○○二一—十分局數　（一二三四五六七）　▲麥令○四三○○○○—七分安打○二四一一○二—十記（中華陣容）（麥令陣容）</p>

<p>賢鈁盃之第七幕比賽、已於昨日如期舉行、然據上海中國綱球聯合會書記陸奚鳥君云、各隊比賽報告單、常逾規定時間、不見送交、今日更甚殊感因難望各隊嗣後自愛愛人、實深盼禱云、</p>
<p>中華之單打陣線、略見更動、不能全勝夏光、殊屬可惜、第一雙打朱及舉行、改期補賽、目下中梁德光（中）勝郭彭年（夏）七—五·六—一·六—三王元昭（夏）勝許德民（中）二—六·八—六·六—一余田光　錢耀彬　（中）勝楊卓平　郭明堂　（夏）六—二·六—一·八—六陳傳璋　張子　　（中）勝　桂十璜　王元昭　（夏）六—四·六—五·六—三P&gt;第三届扶輪盃　中得决賽權英美均勢</p>
<p>▲中華雙打又勝葡萄牙</p>
<p>▲英雙打勝美形勢相等</p>
<p>今日下午英美兩組單打中對葡取消</p>
<p>第三届扶輪盃萬國網球賽、昨日中華雙打以直落三勝葡萄牙奪得决賽權、同時英國雙打戰敗美國造成各一相等局面、今日下午四時半起英美有兩組單打比賽、至中葡所餘之兩組單打、因勝局已定、雙方同意、取消比賽、</p>

<p>中葡之戰、在英國戰勝美國之後觀衆情緖爲之一振我國選手林寳章江道章虎步入塲時、均鼓掌迎之、未幾、葡選手亦相率光臨戰端一開乃靜氣安位、以觀其究竟矣</p>
<p>▲刻版文章　第一盤中葡大刀闊斧、互相射擊各不相讓、並駕齊驅林江雙打、素負盛名、至時亦難多占便宜雙方策略如出一輙莫大利用峻利之發球待其反擊另一人把綱迎之乘勢取勝、江勝第一局者賴此法耳、葡如法泡製、亦得手應心於是一比一而至四比四之局面均如刻版文章莫不雷同、第九局江又輪次得勝而第十局由柯拉沙發球、初尙占勢、林氏一次猛烈抽擊、打破成例忽然轉機、結果、中華六比四勝</p>
<p>▲迎頭痛擊　第二盤、中葡高下懸殊、前者迎頭痛擊、不遺餘力、後者氣衰心亂、不知所謂、而一發一攔之得意傑作、似屬前者之專利品矣、在第二局、葡費盡心力、方得一局、其餘均入我手、中華又以六比一勝、</p>
<p>▲最後一幕　第三盤、葡方頗有振作、其初連遭困阨、一比三居於下風、迨至發奮、局勢漸轉、不久、卽見四四平手、林江安肯以旣成局</p>

<p>我有一位朋友。他是黄浦畢業的我和他分别有好幾年了。有一天。無意和他在上海遇着。原來他現在担任某大學的軍事敎官。</p>
<p>我說。（你自在軍校畢業後。我們有好多時没通信了。你這幾年的經歷好呀。）</p>
<p>他說。（我這幾年經歷的可多了。北平、香港、廣州、貴陽、成都、武漢、各處我都到過。可是我的經歷夠使我灰心了。我—且簡單的告訴你。</p>
<p>（我自從畢業後。便派到某師見習。初爲排長。後來升爲連長。我雖然不過是一個下級軍官。可是這時的生活。很令我满意。</p>
<p>（後來因爲環境變化。我也離開了某師。四處奔走。結果想不到的做了湖北某縣禁烟總局長。我是不愛錢的。可是這時錢眞多極。一個月三千五千。簡直不算一回事。我的手下人。每個月整千的往腰裏塞。其餘便是十多個朋友。聚在你身邊。穿衣、吃飯、零用、一切都要你來供給。這種生活。我眞厭棄極了。我說。好。讓你們來幹吧。於是不久我便把職務辭了。</p>
<p>我辭職以後。經過了好幾個地方。到後來爲某師連絡參謀。連絡參謀担任各軍師的連絡。位分是很高的。到師部便與師長同級。到軍部便與軍長同級。薪水也異常豐厚。可是錢雖多。却一文留不起來。爲什麽呢。因爲我是連絡參謀。不得不去應酬。否則連絡不起來。而軍隊中最壞的一件事。便是非（馬將）不能成應酬。唉。我想起這時的生活。眞令我痛心。早上起來。事務淸閒得很。可是我想看一點書。那裏人來了。也並不是送什麽公事來。只是甲找你來謀事。乙找你來說情。丙來托你運動。丁來和你談天。一天的功夫。便消磨在這些碌碌的事務上面。到下午四點鐘。某軍部電話來了。某師部電話來了·甲旅館去開房間。乙旅館去打馬將。你不能不去呀。而和我打馬將的人。他們的名字都上過報紙的。軍長。師長。司令參謀。盡是些大人物。並且軍隊中的打牌與普通不同。輸赢並不是三十五十。起碼有三百五百。你想我能同他們混得來麽。我由此得了一個結論。就是大人物過的是（非人的生活。）我眞厭棄極了。我想（不如歸去）吧。於是不多時我便辭了職。經朋友的介紹。到某大學來當軍事敎官。固然這時薪水遠没有那時多。可是旣無應酬。又無麻煩。我的心倒反淸凈多了。）</p>

<p>友人李君。山東籍。佐戎四川。十七年春。因事返里。途經河南彰德。日旣暮。投宿於五義村之小客店中。已先有旅客三人在焉。午夜就寢。尚未成寐。忽聞人聲喧嘩。噪雜莫辨何語。驚起視之。但見數　十人麕集而談。狀極憤慨。詢之店主人。曰。客遠鄕人。言之無妨。但愼勿外洩。恐俱不利也。蓋余村凡五百餘户。向分天門紅槍二人會。余則隸於天門會。村有事。兩會首議而後行。互相敬讓。從無衝突發生。茲因三日前。有逃軍十二人。各携槍馬。入村行强。不可理喻。經兩會撲殺之。事後天門會擬得其槍。而使紅槍會得其馬。紅槍會則堅欲槍馬各半。議三日而未定。今果决裂而備戰矣。余輩會中人。固應歷之數也。不幸亦適値此刦者。惟君等耳。李君争曰。然則避之可乎。店主人曰。逃避勢所不能。蓋斯時已間諜四伏。任何人不得越雷池一步。雖然。容竭余力爲君等圖之。乃趨告兩會之首。會首許之。於是兩會各派　　人。持燈械送之出。經崗卡凡三。均以奉命送客告。詳查而後放行。迨離村半里許。送者曰。君等</p>
<p>宜疾去。前途可無阻矣。</p>
<p>閱月後。李君事畢赴川。復經該村。抵小客店。則門庭冷落。　無人聲。入其户。僅一老嫗當爐而炊。李君道其來意。並詢及店主人老嫗忽涕泣而告曰。當夜自先生去後。約三小時而戰作。結果天門會大敗。余夫及三子二媳均死焉。家破人亡。</p>

<p>— 英</p>
<p>（救國不忘戀愛。戀愛不忘救國。）是是脫胎於（救國不忘讀書。讀書不忘救國。）這兩句詁。是一班靑年男女的時髦話。在表面上看來。好像兩句話的意思是一樣。其實字面一變動。意義也大有出入。因爲上一句（救國不忘戀愛。）旣要救國。還忘不了戀愛。正合着古語說的（英雄氣短。兒女情長。）結果他（她）的救國工作。没有幹成。恐怕還要僨事咧。下一句（戀愛不忘救國。）他（她）能在戀愛的迷萝中覺醒過來。去幹救國工作。他（她）一定能明白戀愛是狹義的愛。救國是廣義的愛。這種思想是多麽偉大啊。</p>
<p>最近天一公司攝製一部有聲影片（戰地二孤女。）就是闡發這（戀愛不忘救國）之旨。兩個女子。在喪亂流離之中。同愛一個男子。爲了種種環境關係。幾乎釀成三角戀愛的悲劇。但是結果兩個她和一個他。都抛撇了私愛。共赴國難。故事是一波三折。極盡悲歡離合。内容是悲壯激昻。令人觀感起興。時下好談戀愛的靑年男女。實有一觀此片的必要。</p>

<p>自法國紅平連環式瓦。輸入中國。而我國舊時之靑色土磚瓦。幾遭淘汰。於是不得不隨時代之變遷。仿製之。新式磚瓦。乃應運而起。</p>
<p>民初滬商朱志堯。創辦窰廠於浦東三林塘。建造德式窰墩。仿製磚瓦。雖不久卽遭失敗。然爲上海國人機製磚瓦之嚆矢。嗣後相繼而起者。小沙渡有瑞和磚瓦公司。永興路有光華花磚廠。北新涇有華大磚瓦廠。福記製瓷公司。新龍華有泰山磚瓦公司第二廠。塘灣有信大窰廠。浦東有益中磁磚廠。大中磚瓦廠。他若發康中和恊昌合衆興業等廠。或製紅瓦靑瓦。或製路磚火磚。或製碼賽克磁磚。而碼賽克尤爲時代需用品。福記益中出品較佳。暢銷一時。</p>
<p>外人在滬設磚瓦廠者。有比商開設之義品廠。英商開設之中國汽泥磚瓦公司。而汽泥碍瓦。質堅體輕。形如海綿。建築高樓。尤爲適宜。惜其工料嚴守秘密。無從調查。深望研究磚瓦工業者注意之。</p>
<p>機製磚瓦原料。爲黄泥礦泥洋灰煤屑磁土五種。出品爲靑瓦紅瓦紅磚花磚路磚火磚磁磚面磚缸磚空心磚煤屑磚碼賽克等。磚之長短。價之大小。至不一律。銷路以本埠居多。漢口南京天津次之。近年建設事業猛進。該業方興未已也。日本磚瓦。雖工料不逮國貨。市上時有發見。一般人不知利害。每購用之。上海有山東窰業公司者。卽日本磚瓦經理處也。（完）</p>

<p>七十五</p>
<p>朱先生說：（驚人的事實還多着咧。全國公私立小學的學生是有七百萬光景：舊式的私塾裏也至少有七百萬學生。這一千四百萬小學生的費用每年總計至少是十萬元。這每年十萬萬元在傳統敎育之下是完全消費掉了。小學生年紀太小，固然不能充分生産，但是養幾隻雞，種幾棵菜，栽幾株樹，紡幾斤紗，總不能算是過分吧。再不然，掃掃，抹抹棹，洗洗自已的衣服，便省掉成人許多力量，移到生産上去。每個小學生每年用自已的勞動力賺一元錢便是一千四百萬元，賺十元錢便是一萬四千元。據我的觀察，小孩子的力量如果引導適宜，是能造出意料之外的奇跡。小孩子能做一點小生産，小建設。中華民國之創造少不了這些小工人。你再看一看民國十八年七月一日至十九年六月三十日之財政報告。這一年内之國庫支出爲四萬九千五百零七萬元，其中百分之四九，六爲軍費，便是二萬四千五百四十四萬元。這二萬四千五百四十四萬元是年年花在軍事上，繼續花他十年便是二十四萬五千四百四十萬元。這筆欵不但是純粹消費而且是毁滅生産。照十九年九月份的統計看來，全國正式軍隊有二百五十九萬九千二百人，非正式的軍隊還不在内。這二百五十九萬多人多半是農人，原來可以生産，但是一入軍隊便立刻變爲消費者。兵多不能禦外侮，自必有内亂。内亂一來，則工人不能做我，農人不能種地，生産力又被毁滅了。國家養兵好一比是請人保鑣。請人保鑣只是富翁的勾當。窮人只能自保，那能請得起保鑣的。中國是個窮國，靠當兵吃飯的兵是决養不起。我們如果能把這二萬四千五百萬的養兵費充作生産資本，把這二百六十萬兵化爲生産的工人，那又是多麽偉大的個建設的力量呀！）</p>

<p>溯我國以農産立國、絲麻亦其大端、自紡織之業興、植棉機織、並爲重要之實業然、迄於今日、猶不能充分發展者、夫豈人謀之不臧、亦國家之未盡其提倡歟、植棉屬農産、紡織屬機械、均爲專門技術、今之言新農學及精於紡織之工程師、未嘗不研精求勝、獨貨品貴流通、其於征稅方面、尤有重大之關係、際茲提剏國貨之時、社會人士、對於紡織事業、彌復注意、本報爲特就訊紡織業某君、先舉稅則一項道之、俾世人知國貨之亟宜提倡、而提倡國貨、尤有待於國家確立保護政策、爲之先河也、下述某君語、</p>
<p>中國之紡織事業、權輿於晚淸、爲李文忠所奏辦、華商紡織新局、蓋其首創者、即今日上海之恒豐紗廠也、維時國家提　製迨、其機製洋貨之權、則特較他種貨品爲廉、蓋所以抵制舶來品者、棉紗每担徴出口稅關平七錢、以今九八規元、計合銀八錢、每担以三百二十斤、計關平二兩二錢四分、合規元二兩五錢六分而已、如是行之二十餘年、未嘗增益、乃歐戰以後、華府會議、通過中國增加附稅、原夫附稅增加之意象、蓋使進口稅較多、則本國工商業可少得保障、初非加之於國内之貨品也、顧其時民國十二年、孫傳　督蘇、以關稅增加、於土貨亦復照加、於是曩之棉紗、每包稅二兩五錢六分者、加至三兩八錢四分矣、</p>
<p>迨民國十六年、國府成立、軍事浩繁、國用不繼、至十九年、於是復議加紗稅、然以國内之日商紗廠甚多、欲實行加稅、勢非先與熟商不可、遂遣人接洽、擬定每担六元、合每包十八元、自六月至十一月間、往返駁詰、而其時華商紗廠聞訊、亦起而反對、且向立法院陳述利害、結果、舉辦特稅、（現併入統稅）二十三支以下之粗紗、每担挩銀二元七角五分、每包三百二十斤、計八元五角八分、合規元六兩二錢五分、二十三支以上之細紗、每担稅銀三元七角五分、每包十一元六角三分、合規元八兩三錢、蓋所增已倍蓰矣、</p>
<p>且回溯未辦特稅加徴以前、關稅自二兩五錢六分、加至三兩八錢四分之際、所收者關稅、其銷行本省及附近農村者、除蘆金每包一二元外、初不需乎關稅也、迨新制實行、號稱統稅、棉紗出廠、無不徴收、雖本省及附近之農村、亦同此稅率、而内地之廠家、（若南通無錫等）向有、部分銷於附近、素不負担此項稅率者、今亦一·律負担、而營業亦遂更難發展矣、</p>
<p>夫棉紗之製造、其原料爲棉花、我國棉花質料較遜、勢不能不用外棉、至棉花之進口稅、向爲每担銀一兩二錢、自關稅加徴、又改用金單位以來、每担稅率、已至銀三兩之鉏、棉紗每包須用棉三百餘斤、於是廠家出品之棉紗、每包除付稅率六兩</p>
<p>二錢五分、或八兩三錢以外、尙須担負此原料三百餘斤之入口稅、計十兩七八錢、此蓋爲各國所未有者、試以日本境内之紗稅爲比較、則其同以外棉爲原料、而行銷國内不出口者、每包較我國廠家之負担、省去關稅及外棉進口凡十七八兩之譜、而其成紗之出口者、亦較我國廠家少負担此外棉進口稅每包十兩七八錢也、至於中國産棉、雖不豐美、亦頗有可用者、然採辦之艱難、當地之需索、在在使商家裏足、如前年鄂中老河口一帶産細花四十餘萬担、每担僅二十元、初不爲昻、商家遂往採辦、乃老河口之上游、爲匪軍駐地、其下游通沙市之一路、則爲省軍所駐、商家商諸匪軍、匪軍索每担四元、始允假道、商之省軍、其軍部索每担六元、爲之護運、乃旣付六元、軍部之命令、仍復不能下達、駐軍又索每担六元、方允放行、商人計無所之、但能照付、於是所購之棉花、其成本運費不計外、負担至每担十六元、折閱不堪、亦更無人敢再往試外、此北方各鐡路運輸、其權多憎駐軍、非另付以車皮費、不爲運輸、而日商之在濟南購花者、以膠濟路有特殊勢力、隨時可運、亦僅付照例之運費、無他需索、於是華商廠家、萬不獲已、亦僅可就日商手中購國産之棉花爲可嘆息、然因此而農家之植棉者、亦幾無人往購、爲更痛苦矣、進口棉花、以最近一棉花會計年度、自十二年七月至今年六月稍計之、美棉凡一百萬包、合三百七餘萬担、値規元一萬一千餘萬兩、印度棉花、當不在内、其數可驚、夫以中國爲農業國家、而農業重要之棉花、仰給外人者如此、流出之金錢如許、其將何以爲國乎、</p>
<p>關於國内植棉事業、自民國二年、華商紗廠聯合會、請東南大學試行改良棉種以來、幾二十年、所費亦已十餘萬元、然其成效尙不普通者、厥有二因、一優質種子不易散布於各省各鄕、二各省各鄕最宜植棉者、莫如晋豫陜魯北方諸省、然其地農民植棉之利、萬不如種鴉片、蓋植棉未必即易銷售、農民又無力可以久屯、不如鴉片之隨種售、獲利較厚也、</p>
<p>西北棉産亦旺、新疆之花尤佳、然以交通不便、運輸須時、遂致不能暢行於國内、　者、津滬廠家亦有試購新棉者、多分小包、以十四磅爲一包、交郵局寄遞、每包郵費可一元餘、産利於地、謀國者誠不可不知矣、</p>
<p>九一八事變以來、日貨均在抵制之列、日棉遂亦滯銷、於是以跌價相競爭、凡中國紗之售、每包一百六十兩者、日紗則一百四十兩、中紗價落、日紗又因而照跌、務使中國紗無可再跌、無可售賣而後已、此實尙不得謂之爲傾銷、僅可謂之爲搗亂而已、棉布亦然、如中國廠製之油斜紋、每疋售六兩二錢、日貨售四兩八錢、以此類推、極其破壞之能事、而兩方仍難暢銷、惟北方則以經濟交通之種程關係、銷路並不減少、至於售價接之原料成本、中國廠紗平均售每包一百六十兩左右並不爲高、惟以市價漲落、相差懸殊、人民購買方減少、商家觀望、因而滯銷、固不能歸咎於紗價之昻、蓋一百六十兩左右、爲近三年最低價格、且原料爲舶來之外棉、金價增高、已逾一倍、售價如此、相形並不居奇、或有謂華紗因抵制日貨之後而高漲者、殊屬過慮之詞矣、</p>

<h3 id="c125">廢兩改元聲中　外商銀行態度 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲所以主張俟十年廿年後</p>
<p>▲目的在保留操縱金融權</p>
<p>廢兩改元問題、自經財政部表示决心實行、并設會研究後、各地商會及本市各業、均表示贊同、但對於此後新幣成色、及發行紙幣監督辦法、則主張須有嚴重之注意、但外商銀行代表穆叔脫、則對改元事、頗有不同之主張、新聲社記者以廢兩後對於對外贸易結價、及先令價格、均有關係、特探訪關於此事之消息如下、</p>
<p>▲外商銀行態度　外商銀行代表穆叔脫、曾以書面向財政部研究委員會表示態度、主張廢兩改元、須待十年或二十年之後、方能實行、其理由根據十年來洋厘平均數目爲七錢二分一厘七毫五、故以爲新銀幣之假定重量爲七錢零九厘、未免太低、造幣廠必須製造與現在市面流通之幣同其重量及成色、鑄費一項、應由政府負擔、每月約需一百五十萬至二百五十萬之數、待至新銀幣準備充足後、再行實施廢兩、總之、在原則上雖無反對、而實際上則主張延宕、</p>
<p>▲中國委員駁復　對於外國銀行代表穆叔脫之表示、當研究委員席上、中國委員陳行·貝淞蓀·等、均已加以駁復、以當此銀元充斥洋厘暴落之時、廢兩改元、實爲最好之時機、若待之十年二十年之後、則市面變化、能否實行、正是問題、且新銀幣如成色較佳、則政府鼓鑄、私人改鎔、新幣永無敷用之時、廢兩又焉有實行之日、至銀幣鑄費、應由人民負擔、德法日本皆然、蓋目前政府狀况、决無負擔此項經費之能力也、</p>
<p>▲十年前之主張前匯豐銀行</p>
<p>上海行經理史迪脫G·H·Stitt於一九二○年上海英國商會開會時、關於廢兩改元問題、曾有演詞、略謂外商公會於一九一九年在上海會議議决、向中國政府請求廢止銀兩、統一全國元銀之銀輔幣及銅幣、並在上海設立造幣廠、自由鑄造銀幣、俾能有效管理造幣廠、可維持單一標準之制、聞已由中國政府正式　建議、當局對此、頗有容納傾向、先是兩年前外商銀行方面、曾與財政當局交換意見、銀行方面、多承認若能廢除銀兩、并統一銀幣、實爲有利無弊之舉、目前銀行界對於銀兩之匯兌、兩元間之換算、雖得相當利益、但深信統一銀幣後、於商業將有極好影響、届時雖失去銀兩上之利益、而所得將過於所失、惟統一銀幣時、必須極端嚴格、使其成色重量、舉國一致、與歐美各國之貨幣相同、則新制度必能推行無阻云云、即此、可見當時外商銀行、亦極盼廢兩改元之能實行也、</p>
<p>▲主張延宕癥結、外商銀行、旣於十二年前有建議中國政府廢兩改元之舉、而現在政府决心實行、則又謂須俟之十年二十年之後、新聲社記者、昨特向對金融情形非常熟悉者、詢問外商銀行對於主張延宕之原因、據談此次廢兩改元、對内爲統一幣制、對外爲收回金融主權、因現在上海市面、旣以銀兩爲單位、故（一）大條進口、即爲貨幣、供求盈虧、權操外人、廢兩後、則大條僅爲一種貨物、欲其成爲銀幣、必須經過中央造幣廠鑄牌、銀兩旣廢、則估價權將移歸中央銀行、因以上兩種原因、故外商銀行主張延宕、或即受私利觀念之影響、希圖保留其操縱之權也、</p>

<h3 id="c166">郭羅自殺 <a href="#c166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨據報載又有殺案兩起，一，郭松齡之姪郭明星，因剌激過深，在杭自殺，一，靑大學生羅演存，因被學校除名，認爲莫大寃抑，而自殺，以上兩椿案件，我認爲都無自殺之價値，這是現在靑年意志薄弱没有深沈强毅氣槪的徵象，因爲做一個人，須要從困苦艱難中奮鬭出來的生路，方是生路，從盤根錯節做出來的事業，方是事業，若一經失敗挫折，就要自殺，這種心理，完全差誤，</p>
<p>（一）郭松齡之姪郭明星，因闔家被人慘害，即使手刃仇家，尙未足以洩不共之　，故欲潛往黑省邊境，召集其父舊部，抵抗日軍，這是何等偉大的志願，實爲深佩，不料以川資用罄，遽萌短見，殊爲失著，因欲報仇，須留得自我的存在，則仇方可以報，若自已先已毁滅，則是等於不欲報仇，而先爲仇所報，其不應死者一，且人特恐不肯犧牲，若肯犧牲，亦應取得相當之代價，在郭君雖不能集合其父舊部，抵抗日軍，即以個人犧牲，亦未始不可以取得相當的代價，則其犧牲方有價値，昔伍子胥欲報殺父的仇，情願吹簫吳市，申包胥欲復吳國的仇，在秦廷哭了七日七夜，卒復吳國的仇，這種報仇，何等厲害，何等有意義，何等有價値，</p>
<p>（二）羅自存因家道貧寒，無力升學，經省府與親友資助，始得考入靑島大學，又因靑大發生學潮，竟將羅除名，因此無面目回籍，消極自殺，這是我有兩種意見，爲之解釋，一，學校當局，將羅除名，而羅自問平日在校，并未違犯校規，考試亦均及格，此是學校當局的差誤，羅君祇要問心無愧，可說與羅毫無關係，二，若說一經開除，名譽攸關，無法轉學，我到是有個主張，試問現在一張大學畢業文憑，典當裏當得進麽，換飯吃換得動麽，一則大學畢業生的日多，二則大學畢業生中，有許多文理不通的，有不能翻譯一篇英文的，大有人在，一個人讀書，因爲求學而讀書，不是因爲文憑而讀書，所以九十三老人馬湘伯嘗說過，中學畢業，猶如得一把書箱的鑰匙，若欲研究何種學問，只要自已去找尋，所以不一定大學畢業，是學問好的，大學不畢業是學問歹的，　　本來現在的大學，原是貴族化的，只有幾位資本家的子弟，方有進去讀書的幸福，貧苦子弟，只好伸着頭頸在門外看看，（我曾發願以後讀書，擬組織一個大規模之學會，不論貧苦子弟，加入該會，可以自由互想討論研求，但尙没有具體的辦法）試看古來名懦學士，起初或爲人牧，或爲人奴，或映雪　螢，或引錐剌股，卒爲一代懦宗者，不可勝數，現在何必定要到貴族化的大學裏</p>
<p>去，然後爲讀書呢，</p>
<p>所以讀書的問題，我對於國家，對於社會，一點没有帮忙的希望，以後靑年當自已去想辦法，自已去找尋出路，尤其是貧苦的學生，更當自已去刻苦用功研求學問，大學是靠不住，敎員是靠不住，金錢更是靠不住，只有你自已偉大而靈敏的腦筋，是最靠得住，若你把二三千塊大洋，去買到一張空頭的畢業文憑，試問有什麽用處，什麽價値，</p>

<p>飄零客子，　旅居滬濱，寡交遊，少朋友，夏日無聊，驕陽初晚，散步於外灘公園，有感而作，悠悠浦江水，蒼蒼灘頭樹，日落鳥欲棲，遙見林深處。白蟬取次開，靑茭拂水斜，草木饒人意，靜穆自芳華。</p>

<h3 id="c168">機器油 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 左</p>
<p>機器油（Lubicant）即潤滑料的普通稱呼，多數人對於牠不甚重視，殊不知牠於現代文明有絕大的貢獻。没有了牠，供給衣食用品和知識的無窮數的輪軸，都要宣告停頓了；一切機械，小者如手錶，大者如發電所的渦輪，都要停止工作，工廠和運輸器具都要停滯，而食物等等之來源就此斷絕了。現代的機械世界固由於輪軸的發明所造成，而助成之者實爲機器油的發明。</p>
<p>機器油的作用是怎樣的？我們在回答這個問題以前，必先知道摩擦是什麽一回事。試把極光滑的平面，放在顯微鏡下觀察，便見有無數的突剌，橡貓舌一般。當兩平面相壓而移動，這些突剌就互相鈎結而阻滯運動。此種阻滯就是所謂摩擦。摩擦的多少全視表面的粗細和用力的大小而定。</p>
<p>機器油的塗敷，目的在乎把兩個平面隔開，使其不相牽掣，因而得以活動自如。據精密研究，敷於兩平面間的油膜至少分爲三層，上下兩層各緊貼於每一平面上而隨之行動，中間一層或數層則懸浮於中。故彼此互相滑過者，實爲液體，而非固體。機器油之所以能潤滑機件而使之行動自如，即在於此。</p>
<p>兩平面間的油膜的厚薄對於潤滑效果，無其關係。曾有人用Ａ線檢騐，祇有數分子厚的一薄層油膜應用於汽車引擎，得到了異常美满的潤滑效果。世界上一切輪軸無不駕着這種奇妙的油膜而疾轉。當機軸靜止時，觸着軸承的底部，而將機油擠在兩旁。但當軸轉動時，將油抽引至底部，軸乃浮升於空中，以油膜爲底墊。某實騐家曾用精密器械，測得輪軸旋轉時升起約千分之二至三英寸。</p>

<h3 id="c169">廢除迷信的先决問題　如何破除迷信 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 程·浩·</p>
<p>日昨歐陽女士在本刋發表一篇關於廢除迷信的文字，主張應該免除求神拜佛的靡費，以之來做有益社會國家的事業。我對於這種主張，非常贊成。不過我以爲如不能先將一般人民的迷信觀念除去。恐怕萬難達到實現的目的。所以這裏有個先决問題：就是怎樣破除迷信？</p>
<p>（迷信）的意義，就是迷惑失了覺察的信仰。因爲是一種迷惑失覺的信仰，所以深潛腦中，打破甚難，我國一般人之迷信鬼神，自幼潛移默化，深印腦海，革除自不容易。雖近年來社會上有一種（打倒迷信）的口號流行着，可是迷信的潛勢力仍然很大，大多數的人民仍是很厲害的被魔醉而不知自覺。我們祇要到虹廟及城隍廟去看一看，每天都是許多男的女的老的少的很熱閙的在那兒很莊嚴誠心的燒香點燭唸唸拜佛，上海是頂摩登的地方，尙且如此，其他省縣，自然可想而知。而且迷信的人，大多頑固的很，無可理喻。你對他們說求神拜佛是不能降福祛禍的，是一種無益之舉吧，他們誰也不會　你，無論你的理由怎麽充足，解釋怎樣明白，他們是决也不會信服的。因爲他們已被那惡魔執住難於解絆了。作者曾屢向家庭宣傳破除迷信，而屢受重斥：家庭感情幾乎亦因此而破裂。革除迷信之難，於此可見。所以我以爲（迷信）問題，實在是我國一個很重大的社會問題，而又是一個最難解决的問題。</p>
<h3 id="c170">一段考試時事實 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>

<p>ＸＸ中學的裏面，許多新生在那裏考史地自然。</p>
<p>（喂！喂·請問一聲：天津在山東省麽？）</p>
<p>一位矮短身材的朋友向着一位身材稍長坐在他旁邊的朋友打着問訊：那位身材稍長的朋友先抬起頭來對那監試先生望了望，然後輕輕的對他道：（對的。）但是在他自已的試紙上却寫着河北省三個鉛筆字。</p>
<p>中國三大流域？（一）長江，（二）黄河，（三）·······哦：揚子江！）</p>
<p>矮朋友放了筆，雙手捧着頭，只是在那裏窮想。</p>
<p>（對了，一定是揚子江！）</p>
<p>矮朋友又自說了一句，然後提起筆來把他自以爲對的（中國三大流域）［寫進去了。</p>
<p>半個小時後，那位身材稍長的朋友已把十個題目都做完了：就立起身來去交卷，回來時，看見那位矮朋友第三個題目的答案：</p>
<p>（中國被異族人統一兩次），（答唐宋。）</p>
<p>身材稍長的不覺鼻中嗤的一聲；後來又知道他是ＸＸ敎員的兒子，名字呌做ＸＸＸ。</p>
<p>數天後，ＸＸ中學的新生揭曉了，那位長身材的朋友也拿了一份報紙在那裏瞧着，但是看來看去總尋不到自已的名字，却只有那ＸＸＸ三個字，高懸在自已的眼前！</p>

<h3 id="e1">International Economic Conference - Minor <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The international economic conference proposed by Britain at the Lausanne Conference is now in formal preparation. Invitations will soon be issued to the representatives of various countries who are serving as members of the preparatory committee. In addition to Britain, there are seven countries: the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Belgium, and Norway. They are requested to meet immediately to carry out the preparatory work. This conference may be called the World Currency and Finance Conference. The location is set in London. The date will be decided after the US presidential election in November. China and other countries will be invited to participate. This conference is an important meeting following the Lausanne Conference, aimed at alleviating the world economic panic. Its future is of great importance and deserves our close attention.</p>
<p>This global economic panic occurred in 1929. Scholars have many opinions on the causes of its occurrence, but the main ones are generally no more than three: first, the disputes over reparations and war debts; second, Britain's loss of its position in guiding and regulating the world economy, leading to chaos in the world financial market; and third, the contraction of currencies, lowering of prices, and raising of interest rates by various countries, making it difficult to fulfill all international debt relationships due to the fall in prices. Therefore, to alleviate the world economic panic, these three causes must be carefully considered and appropriate countermeasures sought. The convening of the Lausanne Conference was intended to solve the first cause, and it has now achieved considerable success, which need not be repeated. The international economic conference under preparation is aimed at addressing the second and third causes.</p>
<p>Why do we say that Britain has lost its position in guiding and regulating the world economy? Because before the World War, Britain was the most economically powerful country. It lent a huge amount of long-term and short-term capital to other countries. If a financial panic occurred in a foreign country, the Bank of England only needed to lower the interest rate, and a large amount of capital would flow to the foreign country. Conversely, if foreign finance was too prosperous, the Bank of England would raise the interest rate to bring the capital back. In this way, the balance of world finance was maintained.</p>
<p>However, after the Great War, the British economy suffered great difficulties. The former lender to foreign countries now borrows from foreign countries. Its industry has also encountered a strong rival in the United States and has a tendency to decline, completely losing its ability to regulate world finance. At this time, when a financial panic occurred in the world, there was no one to remedy it. Furthermore, since Britain restored the gold standard in 1925, countries around the world have also restored it one after another. In order to maintain their gold standard and prevent the flow of cash to the United States and France, they have also contracted currencies, raised interest rates, and lowered prices. However, when prices fall, it becomes difficult to fulfill international debts. Why do we say this? Because the fulfillment of international debts, although due to the payment of cash, the source of payment must still be taken from the export of goods. When prices fall, the export of goods must be increased. Increasing exports cannot but compete with the commodities of other countries and further depress their value. The inability to fulfill Germany's reparations payments is an important reason for this. (Currently, due to the economic panic, countries have successively suspended the gold standard in order to raise prices.)</p>
<p>Therefore, what the international economic conference will discuss is how to reorganize and regulate financial methods, and how to raise prices. According to the minority opinion of the Gold Committee of the League of Nations, it advocates changing the gold standard to a paper currency standard, and organizing a common institution with representatives from countries around the world to take responsibility for regulating finance, just like the method Britain used before the war. However, some people believe that the gold standard should still be adopted. This currency issue is what needs to be discussed urgently at the future conference.</p>
<p>As for the future of the economic conference, it seems unnecessary for us to speculate in detail today, when the conference is still in preparation. However, we cannot help but say that we hope that countries will not bring political reasons into the scope of economic discussion. Although the countries of the world are separated and independent in terms of their political territories, they are actually interconnected and form a whole in terms of their economic relations. If the economic situation of one country changes, its impact is often enough to affect the world and cannot be stopped. This can be seen from the recent economic panic, from which no country in the world has been spared. It is a pity that the politicians of the world often fail to understand this principle deeply and strongly want to limit economic disturbances with modified territories, such as raising tariff barriers and protecting domestic markets, which is a manifestation of this mentality. For example, forcing Germany to bear huge amounts of reparations, and the United States' refusal to reduce war debts for the Allied countries, contain political overtones. This kind of behavior not only does not benefit the country's economic situation, but its result is enough to make the world economy more chaotic. Now the problem of reparations and war debts has been solved by the Lausanne Conference, so we hope that countries can still adhere to the spirit of the Lausanne Conference to face the future international economic conference.</p>

<p>(Peiping) At the extraordinary conversation meeting of the Political Committee, Zhang reported on the process, his attitude was passive, and he decided to telegraph Wang to resign and take the blame to apologize to the people of the country. He also telegraphed Wang, asking him to put national affairs first and not to speak lightly of resignation. After Zhang prepares to resign, the military will be handed over to the Military Affairs Commission, and the politics will be handed over to the Political Committee. At the same time, Tan Guohuan telegraphed Tang Yulin, asking him to安心 (rest assured) about financial matters and find other solutions.

<p>(Peiping) After President Wang's telegram arrived in Peiping, Zhang Xueliang, fearing that people's hearts would be unsettled, gave a talk to reporters late last night. The general idea was that he was extremely saddened to receive President Wang's telegram. At this time of imminent foreign aggression, at a critical moment, we should have faced the national crisis together. How can there be any other opinions between private individuals? If Mr. Wang wants me to resign, he can tell me directly. Why should he involve himself? Why should he put words in the telegram that are far from the truth? Since the September 18th Incident, my personal life and property have long been put aside, let alone leaving or staying. However, I am a person who is responsible for local security, and in fact, leaving or staying is difficult to be free. From today onwards, I will immediately deploy my subordinates to prepare for the handover. I will never leave and endanger security. This is my frank psychology, and I sincerely hope to貫激始終 (persist to the end) and hope that the people of the country will understand. (7th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Zhang telegraphed Jiang, saying that his personal departure or stay was insignificant, but because he was responsible for the security of North China, he left his post suddenly, and no one was responsible. He also said that the safety of the overall situation in North China was at stake, and asked him to find a way to preside over the overall situation, and he would obey his orders. It is heard that Jiang's reply telegram has arrived. (7th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Li Jishen said that the reason for Wang's resignation was that he was dissatisfied with Zhang Xueliang's dereliction of duty, who was perfunctory to the Central Government's intentions and had no sincerity in accepting the expression. He deeply felt that the future was difficult to handle and retired. If the Central Government had a thorough solution to the Northeast problem, Wang would definitely return to Nanjing immediately to resume his position. The appointment and removal of local officials is the inherent power of the Central Government. If the Central Government has a concrete solution to the Northeast and can entrust a competent person to handle all military and political affairs in North China, Zhang will naturally retreat and will not express any opinion. (7th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Mengyu expressed to others that the reason for Wang's resignation has been stated very clearly in the telegram. If the Central Government hopes that Wang will cancel his resignation and return to Nanjing to take responsibility, it will be difficult to resume his position without first discussing a thorough solution to the problem of resisting insults. I think that in this time of national safety, the Central Government should have an overall plan to solve all domestic obstacles first, and then can we talk about resisting the enemy. Otherwise, it will be enough to cause danger and death. Now I very much hope that Wang will put the country first, first return to Nanjing to preside over the meeting, and then discuss emergency measures to resist insults. (7th Special Telegram)</p>

People and animals desperately fled, and all kinds of vehicles were commandeered to transport the terrified residents to Xin Town for temporary refuge. Several streets in Pristan are four feet deep in water. Harbin has now become an isolated island. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The drainage ditches here are failing to function, causing many streets to be submerged. Residents of the city are traveling by boat. Fuchiadian and other areas are flooded. Although the Songhua River rose for six hours, the rain has stopped, offering some hope. According to information received here, the water levels in the rivers southwest of Harbin continue to rise, and the disaster area is expanding. Repair work is impossible under the current conditions, so traffic cannot be restored until the waters recede. The situation east of Harbin is similar, but the water level is gradually receding, which is slightly encouraging. It is estimated that about one-third of northern Manchuria is flooded.

Hundreds of confirmed deaths have occurred due to drowning. As the floodwaters have not receded, many residents are taking refuge on their roofs. (China United Press, 7th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The flood disaster in northern Manchuria is extremely severe. Many railways, telegraph, and telephone lines in various locations are disrupted. The water depth of the Songhua River near Harbin has reached over 18 feet, breaking the previous high record from 1904 by one foot and one inch, creating a record since the establishment of the Chinese Eastern Railway. The Songhua River, Mudan River, and Nen River have all overflowed, causing immense damage to fields and farmland along the banks. There have also been significant losses of livestock and human lives. Sanxing, a town on the lower reaches of the Songhua River, has likely been completely destroyed. Hundreds of people have drowned in the Mudan River. (Japan United Press, 7th)</p>

<p>Japanese Government to Issue Statement to Foreign Countries</p>
<p>Full-Power Government Budget Estimated at One Million Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 7th – When the Japanese government decided to dispatch a temporary ambassador plenipotentiary to Manchuria, various countries’ governments raised questions. Is the dispatch of the plenipotentiary the same as formally recognizing Manchuria? As a result of the joint agreement between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army yesterday, it was decided that when the new ambassador, Mutō, takes office, Japan will again state to all countries that it has in fact recognized Manchuria. The dispatch of the ambassador plenipotentiary is a prerequisite for legal recognition, and Japan will automatically recognize it at an appropriate time. At the same time, this instruction will be given to Ambassador Mutō.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, July – The budget required to establish the Special Envoy Plenipotentiary Office in Manchuria has been negotiated by the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of the Army. It is reported that the current expenses are 500,000 gold and the personnel expenses are about 500,000 gold, totaling 1 million gold. It is planned to be paid from the reserve fund for the Manchurian Incident.</p>

<p>From Agricultural to Small-Scale Industrial Immigration</p>
<p>Because Agriculture is Exhausted, Small Industries Can Develop</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo News - The Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs has seen that overseas immigrants to the South Seas and South America have been engaged in agriculture in recent years, and agricultural products have been declining day by day, causing these immigrants to suffer extreme exhaustion. It has therefore decided to change its policy from agricultural immigration to small-scale industrial immigration. Moreover, the bicycle repair workers who immigrated to Brazil at the beginning of this year have achieved very good results. According to information from various sources, blacksmiths, bicycle repair workers, and other small industrialists have plenty of room for development. The implementation of this new policy is also a way to help small industrialists in the mainland (Japan). (World News Agency)</p>
<p>▲ Immigrating to the Northeast</p>
<p>Japanese Rascal Soldiers Use This to Collect Money</p>
<p>Naive People Are Deceived and Cannot Return</p>
<p>▲ Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that since the establishment of the Manchurian puppet organization, mainland immigrant groups have entered Manchuria one after another. At the same time, fraudulent acts have emerged one after another. Between May and June of this year, a retired army sergeant named Kitaoka Kisei from Asakura Village, Kamisa District, Kochi Prefecture, claimed to have returned from inspecting Manchuria and declared (when inspecting Manchuria, he contacted the East Asia Industrial Encouragement Society, and as a result, the company invested 400,000 yuan, and Manchuria Railway and the fellow villagers' association assisted him to buy 1,500 items of land in Jilin Province. From last year, he can enjoy the right to cultivate. In addition, the government is willing to subsidize 1,000 yuan per person every year). On the one hand, he started to recruit the Tosa immigrant group and distributed leaflets, and he has already taken office as the head of the group. As a result, applicants have flocked in endlessly. It is stipulated that each person must pay 300 yuan for immigration fees. A total of 18 people have paid the fees and applied, and 5,400 yuan has been collected. In addition to deducting 300 yuan for his own inspection fee and 400 yuan for handling fees, he also distributed travel expenses to the recruiters and prepared to leave. However, Kitaoka left alone first, and all other matters were handled by the deputy head, Nakamura. Afterwards, the applicants packed their bags and went to Manchuria, passing through Dalian and arriving in Shenyang. Unexpectedly, after arriving in Shenyang, the so-called East Asia Industrial Encouragement Manchuria Railway Fellow Villagers Association and others all claimed that this was not the case. Only then did they realize that they had been deceived. However, they were still silent. At that time, Yamashita Eikyuki, the president of the Shenyang Kochi Prefecture Fellow Villagers Association, was shocked when he heard about this and telegraphed the governor of Kochi Prefecture. Only then did he learn that these 18 people had all liquidated their family properties and gathered 300 yuan to come, and now they are in a situation where they cannot return if they want to, and they cannot stay if they want to. Finally, each person made their own claims. Among them, the brothers of the Kawa and Mura Tsuru Kame in the Takaoka Village first returned to the country to announce everything and warned the people of the country to take the lesson of the past. However, this matter was due to the fraud of the soldiers, and Kitaoka had already escaped, so it is feared that it will not be easy to solve.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Tucson, 6th - The U.S. Prosecutor here reported to the State Department today that he had asked the Mexican government to investigate the expulsion of overseas Chinese by Mexico, with Arizona as the tail. Since March of this year, more than 2,000 overseas Chinese have been deported to China from Arizona, costing the U.S. government more than 400,000 yuan. Although there are many wealthy businessmen among these overseas Chinese, according to U.S. law, the travel expenses to China are paid by the government. Most of the undocumented overseas Chinese detained in Arizona are those who have been expelled from Sonora, Mexico, by the authorities.</p>

<p>There Will Be New Developments in the German Political Situation in the Coming Days</p>
<p>The Atrocities Everywhere Still Have Not Stopped</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Berlin, 6th - People here generally believe that the authorities will have talks that may realistically affect the development of the political situation in the next few days. General Defense Minister Schleicher and Hitler's confidant Goering went to the Baltic Sea resort for vacation today. After the two left, Hitler, the leader of the National Socialist Party, suddenly arrived in Berlin and stayed at Goering's residence. Both the National Socialist Party and the government now deny that Hitler had direct correspondence with the cabinet after the election. Hitler has been meeting with the captains of his stormtroopers for days, urging them to strictly restrain themselves. The panic war that is currently underway is hindering the smooth development of political affairs. Therefore, the public believes that the government intends to wait for two more days, up to Monday, and see if Hitler's appeal to his troops has any effect. If it is ineffective, the president will be asked to issue an emergency order to deal with the current terrorism in a special way. All newspapers are now full of news of atrocities. In the past 24 hours, people have thrown bombs in Baileunswick and other places. Someone tried to burn the emblem of the Republican National Emblem Corps in the White Leizi Village of Berlin at night, and 300 members of the National Socialist Party tried to attack the Catholic Church. Fortunately, the news leaked, and the National Emblem Corps and the volunteer team of the Catholic Church made arrangements to defend the church in advance. When the attackers flocked in, they repelled them, smashing only a few glass windows. The riots in other places cannot be fully recorded.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Activities of the National Salvation Army in Southern and Eastern Liaoning <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲ The People All Assist the National Salvation Army in Resisting Japan</p>
<p>A Correspondent in Beiping Reports: According to reports from commissioners, the National Salvation Army in Southern Liaoning has become more powerful since recapturing Liaozhong and Tai'an, and has established its headquarters in western Haicheng to secretly carry out reorganization work. It has conducted a strict inspection of the various units under its command. After that, it began to carry out the clearing campaign in its jurisdiction. Not only did it deal with the Japanese army, but it also captured and eliminated small groups of bandits. As a result, large and small battles took place everywhere. Now, within the jurisdiction of the Second Military Region, from the southern Manchurian railway line in the east to the Yingkou railway line in the west, there are no traces of Japanese soldiers. Although there are occasionally one or two small groups of bandits appearing, they are afraid of the power of the National Salvation Army and dare not take large-scale actions. An investigation shows that the distribution of the National Salvation Army is as follows: the headquarters and the headquarters of the First Route Army are in western Haicheng, the headquarters of the Second Route Army is located in Tai'an, the Third Route is in the eastern and northern parts of Tai Pan Mountain and the entire Liaozhong, the Fourth and Seventh Routes are in Liaozhong, co-defending with the Third Route, the Fifth Route is located in the four suburbs of Yingkou, and the Sixth Route is in western Liaoyang. The people within this scope are happy to assist the National Salvation Army, providing supplies and ammunition as much as possible. The headquarters also issues receipts to be repaid after the recovery of the Northeast. The headquarters has a propaganda department, and it accompanies the army wherever it goes, spreading anti-Japanese propaganda. As a result, the morale of the people is very high. If the government is not willing to give up the Northeast, it should take advantage of this opportunity to use this popular support, which can be of great use. In terms of eastern Liaoning, Huang Yufu, the commander-in-chief of the National Salvation Army, has now transferred 1,200 soldiers from the Weidui First Brigade, commanded by Wang Pengfei, who was stationed in the Benxi area, to Tonghua to listen to Tang Juwu's command. He has also transferred 2,000 soldiers from the Cai Liangsan unit stationed in Shenyang to Tang to increase the strength of the eastern border. After Tonghua was bombed by Japanese planes, Tang Juwu ordered the National Salvation Army to cooperate with the political department personnel to investigate. It was found that 70 people were killed or injured and dozens of houses were destroyed. Tang has already negotiated with the Chamber of Commerce and the county government to provide relief and has telegraphed his troops to clear the area, strictly guard the passes, relieve merchants and civilians, 免稅捐, so as to relieve the people's difficulties. In addition, on July 20, 1,800 Japanese soldiers went from Fushun to Xinbin, burning and killing along the way. All men over the age of 16 and the villages along the way were not spared. According to the investigation, the Japanese army's intention was to eliminate the base of the National Salvation Army.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Hunan Province Opens Up Grain and Rice Ban <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲ Charge a License Fee of One Yuan per Stone</p>
<p>▲ Expected to Release 5 Million Stones of Rice</p>
<p>Changsha News: Hunan is the province with the most abundant grain and rice production. Except for last year when the flood disaster was severe and there was no grain harvest, and the grains were not allowed to be exported, the average annual export of rice is about 4 million stones. Not only is the rural economy invigorated, but the government's finances also rely on this as a major source of income. This year, the weather has been favorable, and the whole province has had a bumper harvest. The first crop of early rice in the lakeside counties has been harvested, and the grain price is only two yuan and thirty-four cents per stone, and the rice price is no more than five yuan per stone. The second crop of late rice has now been planted. In Changsha, the price of the best machine rice is only eight yuan and eight cents, and ordinary rice is only sold for six yuan, which is the lowest price in the past three years. He Jian has decided to take this opportunity to open up the border and lift the ban, and release rice for export, one to invigorate the social economy and the other to help the treasury. All opening plans have been formulated as follows: (1) The date of opening the border and lifting the ban is set to be August 10. (2) License fees: this time, the rice donation will not be collected for the release of rice, only the passport fee will be collected, which is one yuan for each stone of rice, and half for grain. It is estimated that 5 million stones of rice will be released this time, and a total of 5 million yuan will be obtained. (3) Location of the offices: this time, no rice donation bureau will be established, only grain and rice inspection offices will be established. A total of six offices will be set up in the province as follows: Changsha, Lulin Tan, Chenglingji, Nanhua, Lian, Liling. (4) Passports will be filled out and issued by the Finance Department, and each grain and rice inspection office will verify and release them. (5) The military rice passport shall be charged half the fee. (6) A general grain and rice inspection office will be set up in the Finance Department, and Jiang Guangxian will be appointed as the director to preside over all the work of opening the rice ban, and will still be under the supervision and command of the Director of the Finance Department.

<h3 id="e69">Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters: The Ripple Effects of the Communist Party Case <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ Provincial Party Headquarters Claims Xiao Xuetai is Not a Communist</p>
<p>▲ However, Xiao's Confession Clearly Acknowledges Himself as a Communist</p>
<p>▲ The Central Government Suddenly Orders the Case to be Transferred to Beijing for Trial</p>
<p>▲ The Public Rises in Petition to Resolve the Case Locally</p>
<p>▲ The Wonderful Spectacle of the Public and Central Committee Members Kneeling to Each Other</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the Communist Party case occurred in Ningxiang County Party Headquarters, the opinions of the Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government diverged greatly. The Party Headquarters insisted that Xiao Xuetai and others were not Communists and accused the Provincial Government of deliberately using this as an excuse to undermine Party affairs. Letters and telegrams flew back and forth in various attempts to rescue them. Initially, they requested the Provincial Party Headquarters to send personnel to jointly try the case, but this was rejected. They then telegraphed the Central Government, requesting them to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and exonerate them. On the Provincial Government's side, they were convinced that Xiao and others were indeed Communists, and they considered the actions of the Provincial Party Headquarters to be sheltering Communists. Both sides went to extremes, and the case could not be resolved. The Central Party Headquarters, due to the expansion of the dispute, had no choice but to send personnel to investigate the truth. Initially, Chen Zhaoying and Feng Ti were sent to investigate, but both declined to take on the responsibility. Fang Juehui and Zhang Daofan were then sent, but Zhang also declined, and Hong Ludong was appointed instead. Fang and Hong have been in Hunan for more than half a month, but they have not made any clear statements regarding this case. Unexpectedly, He Chengjun in Hankou captured Tang Zi Hu, a key Communist in Ningxiang, who was the one who introduced Xiao Xuetai into the Communist Party. He was escorted to Hunan on July 30th, and on July 31st, He Jian personally interrogated him. Under cross-examination between Xiao and Tang, Xiao finally lowered his head and admitted that he had indeed joined the Communist Party and had a written confession. At this point, the case became clear. On August 1st, He Jian publicly reported this at the expanded memorial week held in Zhongshan Hall and issued an order to execute Xiao Xuetai, whose confession was conclusive, on the afternoon of the 2nd to appease the people. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the 2nd, an urgent telegram arrived from the Central Party Headquarters, the Military Commission, and the Executive Yuan, ordering that Xiao's case and witnesses be transferred to Beijing and designated a court for trial. Upon receiving the telegram, He Jian found it inconvenient to execute Xiao. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government to strongly argue that the case should still be handled locally in Hunan Province, he also requested Fang and Hong to appeal to the Central Government on his behalf. Fang and Hong felt that since they had already been ordered to transfer the case to Beijing for trial, their mission was complete, and they were scheduled to leave Hunan and return to Beijing on the afternoon of the 4th. The personnel of the Enforcement Department of the Qingxiang Headquarters, because Xiao's case was being transferred to Beijing, had no legal basis to act and therefore submitted their collective resignation. However, the division commanders stationed in Hunan and the heads of the security teams in various counties sent telegrams one after another, stating that Xiao was an important Communist bandit, and if he could not be executed locally immediately, then the Qingxiang campaign to suppress bandits would be a wasted effort. They demanded that He Jian still execute Xiao according to the law and opposed the transfer to Beijing. The situation gradually became tense. At 9:00 AM on the 4th, four to five thousand people from all sectors of society in the provincial capital suddenly gathered at the Chamber of Commerce, unanimously opposing the transfer of Xiao's case to Beijing, and went to the Youth Association to petition Fang and Hong. For a time, the area around the Youth Association on Canghou Street was packed with people, blocking the road. After arriving at the Youth Association, representatives from all sectors, such as Hu Yiru and Yuan Yousheng, presented a petition to Fang and Hong, demanding that Xiao be executed locally. Fang and Hong replied that the evidence in this case had been forwarded to the Central Government, and since the Central Government had already issued an order to transfer the case to Beijing for trial, their mission of investigation was complete. The Central Government would definitely not condone or shield Communists, and they asked everyone to rest assured. The public felt that the response was unsatisfactory and surrounded Fang and Hong, asking them to clearly state whether Xiao Xuetai and others were Communists. Fang and Hong replied that since the case had been transferred to Beijing for trial, whether Xiao was a Communist should await the investigation by the Central Government, and they were not yet able to make a clear statement. Before they could finish speaking, the crowd erupted in an uproar, arguing that Fang and Hong had been in Hunan for investigation for half a month and should have a clear understanding of this case. If Xiao was a Communist, he should be executed immediately and not transferred to Beijing. If Xiao was not a Communist, Fang and Hong should be responsible for releasing him to avoid injustice. Their inability to give a clear answer was a dereliction of duty, and they were severely criticized. Order was lost, and it was impossible to maintain. At that time, Tan Changkai, a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, a member of the Provincial Government, and concurrently the Director of the Construction Department, happened to arrive. Seeing that Fang and Hong were in a difficult situation, he stepped forward to mediate, asking the public to step back slightly and promising to ask Fang and Hong to allow him to execute the case locally according to the evidence. The public did not accept the mediation, shouting that Director Tan should not suppress public opinion and still demanded that Fang and Hong give a clear answer, otherwise they would not leave the venue. The order remained chaotic as before. Fang and Hong had no choice but to appear again, and the crowd quieted down slightly and presented three conditions to Fang and Hong: (1) Please clearly state whether Xiao Xuetai and others are Communists; (2) Please telegraph the Central Government to withdraw the order to transfer the case to Beijing; (3) Before Xiao's case is resolved, the two members should not leave Hunan temporarily. At that time, Fang and Hong replied that they completely accepted the second and third items, but the first item still needed to be judged by the Central Government. The crowd was not satisfied and erupted in an uproar again. At this time, more than 30 representatives from Ningxiang County ran onto the stage and knelt down to Fang and Hong, begging them to quickly execute Xiao's case to prevent further unrest. Fang and Hong were extremely embarrassed and also knelt on the stage without saying a word. The crowd below the stage was even more angry, insisting on an immediate answer, otherwise the public would implement self-determination for the Ningxiang case. At this point, Fang and Hong replied to the crowd, admitting that Xiao was a Communist, but they had no right to execute him and would ask the Qingxiang Headquarters to handle it. They would not leave Hunan until Xiao's case was resolved. The crowd felt that verbal promises were unreliable and demanded a written signature. Fang and Hong then wrote on the public petition: "(Today, the public presents the Ningxiang case, which will be punished according to the Qingxiang Headquarters' standards for interrogating Communists. This is specially forwarded to the Qingxiang Headquarters. Signed Hong Ludong and Fang Juehui)." After reading it aloud to the public, the crowd felt that the wording was cunning and refused to disperse. Fang Juehui then added six words to the note: "(There is other conclusive evidence)." The crowd then shouted the slogans "(1) Urgently retain Members Fang and Hong to resolve the Ningxiang case; (2) Oppose the transfer of the Ningxiang case to Beijing for handling," and dispersed. It was already 2:00 PM. After the public's encirclement and petition were resolved, they immediately went to the Qingxiang Headquarters to petition He Jian. Since Fang and Hong had already admitted that Xiao was a Communist, they asked He Jian to immediately order his execution. He Jian replied that since the Central Government had already issued an order for transfer, in order to respect the Central Government, the authorities were really in a difficult position to accept the petition for immediate execution and asked for forgiveness. After repeated negotiations, He Jian only agreed to the following two items: (1) The Ningxiang case will definitely not be transferred to Beijing for handling; (2) The situation of today's public petition will be telegraphed to the Central Government, requesting that the order to transfer the case to Beijing be withdrawn and that it be allowed to be resolved locally. The crowd considered this satisfactory and dispersed. As for Members Fang and Hong, they quietly left Hunan for Hankou on the armored train at 10:00 PM on the 4th. This is the largest mass movement in Hunan in the last two or three years, and it is still unknown how it will ultimately end. (August 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Anhui Province, Luan County: Telegram Requesting the Provincial Government to Quickly Plan for Post-Disaster Relief <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Number of Troops Stationed Around Lu'an Reaches 100 Battalions</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: According to refugees who escaped from western Anhui, bandits are gathering in that area and along the Jiangxi border, currently numbering no less than 100,000. However, they have been heavily surrounded by the National Army. The price of items such as salt and matches has exceeded the ordinary price by dozens of times. The price of grain, on the other hand, is lower than in other places. The supply of grain to the bandit suppression army is quite difficult due to the large number of people. Furthermore, according to military sources, there are currently nearly 100 battalions of the National Army stationed in areas such as Lu'an and Hefei, so the area is full of soldiers. The following is an excerpt from a recent telegram from Zhou Ding, the magistrate of Lu'an County, to the Provincial Government, which can give a glimpse of the situation. Zhou's telegram reads: "(The jurisdiction of Lu'an includes 158 Bao (a type of administrative unit), of which only 40 remain since the area west of the Pi River fell into the hands of the Reds in the 19th year (of the Republic). However, bandits are still as numerous as hairs. Three Li (unit of distance) outside the city, one is immediately kidnapped. Commerce and the people's livelihood are in an unspeakable state. On April 4th of this year, when Yue's division of Chen Tiaoyuan's army retreated, the city was again besieged by Communist bandits, with the city gates closed for more than 80 days. The people ate grass roots and tree bark. All the land outside the city was occupied by bandits, and the grain stored in the villages was all transported to the Red area west of the river. Later, the 12th and 7th divisions arrived one after another, and the city gates were opened on June 24th, but the people were left with bare walls and empty rooms. In this situation, the people of Lu'an are unable to support themselves and have absolutely no strength to bear public obligations. However, at this time of military action, a large army gathers in Lu'an, requiring about 300 Shi (unit of volume) of military rice every day. Buying it locally, even if the people do not eat a single grain and sell everything to the army, is not enough for a few days. Commander Wang Jun and others were forced to purchase supplies from Hefei, but the transportation cost alone is more than 200 yuan per day, and more than 1,000 laborers are needed. In addition, the collection of rice straw is also extremely difficult. Moreover, Lu'an has only about 20 remaining Bao since its recovery, with a small area and a small population. Even if all the able-bodied men do not farm and are entirely used for military service, it is not enough. Moreover, there is fundamentally no one. Also, when the National Army arrives, all military arrangements, such as repairing telegraph poles and wires, and building pontoon bridges for crossing rivers, are done without a single penny. If forced from the people, it is not only something that the authorities are unwilling to do, but there is also no money to be forced. Post-disaster relief and military expenses cannot be done without money. If a good solution is not quickly devised, it will either lead to delays in military affairs or force the people to become bandits. In this emergency period, it is impossible to cope with the critical situation without 40,000 to 50,000 yuan." The Provincial Government considered the matters presented by Magistrate Zhou to be extremely important and submitted them for discussion at the Provincial Government meeting. It was decided that regarding the issues of military food transportation and military expenses, in addition to forwarding the situation to the Military Commission and the Commanders-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Three Provinces for review, a cash sum of 5,000 yuan has been allocated and disbursed for temporary relief.

<h3 id="e71">Shandong Suffers from Continuous Rain and Disastrous Floods <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>▲ Breach in the Yucheng Canal</p>
<p>▲ High Water Levels in the Lower Reaches of the Yellow River</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the beginning of summer, this province has experienced continuous rain, and the water levels of various rivers have risen. In addition to the critical situation at the Dama House construction site on the south bank of Lijin in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, other counties have also reported floods. The earliest reports are: (1) Boshan, where flash floods caused the light railway to be cut off and coal mines to be flooded, causing losses of more than one million yuan. The Jiaoji Railway also suffered huge losses due to the scarcity of coal transport. (2) Guangrao, where the Liu River rose and flooded many fields. (3) Gaotang (i.e., the former course of the Tuohai River according to the Yu Gong), where the Tuohai River rose, causing a vast expanse of water along both banks, with crops submerged in the water. (4) Yucheng also suffered from the rising Tuohai River, with many fields flooded, especially in the area from Yucheng to Zhangzhuang Station on the Jinpu Railway. (5) In the middle section of the Xigou River in Jinxiang, more than 40 Zhang (unit of length) of the river embankment collapsed, and people on both banks of the Wanfu River engaged in械鬥 (armed fights) due to damming the breach. (6) Dongping, where the Xiaoqing River breached on the south bank of Niu Jiaquan on the morning of the 28th, and vast stretches of good fields were engulfed by the torrent. (7) Wucheng, where the county's canal breached in two places after Dong Xuzhuang on the 3rd of this month, with the breaches being more than three Zhang wide and the water flowing powerfully. Efforts are currently underway to plug the breaches. (8) En County, where after the Wucheng Canal breached, the water flowed eastward along the stream, reaching the county and flooding more than a dozen villages. The county officials and people rushed to the river embankment to plug the breaches day and night. In addition, the Dama House on the north bank of Lijin in the lower reaches of the Yellow River has been experiencing high water levels and rapid currents for several days. Today, according to a report from Liang Jinming, the chief of the lower reaches section of the River Affairs Bureau, the water level rose another inch in the early morning of the 4th, and the current was turbulent. The embankment had collapsed to the front of the sectional department, and the courtyard walls of that section had been demolished. The front of the sixth unit of Dama House was submerged, and the situation was critical. Fortunately, materials had been transported there, including a pile of stone from Sun's family, nine boats of straw from Wang Wangzhuang, and 3,000 sacks from Yan's family. Another 1,000 sacks were borrowed from the Lijin Red Cross. The personnel of that section are rushing to protect the embankment. The Lijin County Magistrate, the Public Security Bureau, and the head of the people's militia team have all arrived at the site. Commander Teng of the 59th Brigade stationed in Lijin has also brought 200 soldiers to help throw sacks and stones to protect the embankment. Although the project is dangerous, fortunately there are many people and sufficient materials, so it is not expected to have any accidents. In other places in the lower reaches, the water level rose one Gongcun (unit of length) at Wang Wangzhuang in Putai on the south bank today, and one Gongcun at Scorpion Bay in Bin County. The water level dropped five Gongcun at Dongzhuang in Puyang County on the south bank of the upper reaches, and two Gongcun at Shilibu in Shou Zhang. The construction situation at Zhukou in the upper reaches on the 4th was also relatively stable. In the middle reaches, the water level at Luokou rose one Gongcun and nine Fen (unit of length), with a water level of 30 meters and one inch (90 feet and 3 inches), only 8 inches and 7 Fen lower than the highest water level last year. The River Affairs Bureau is working around the clock. Director Zhang Lianjia only returned to Luokou last night after inspecting the lower reaches. Jinan Mayor Wen Chenglie, considering that Luokou is close to Jinan and of great importance, arrived at Luokou at 4:30 AM this morning to inspect the situation and only returned to Jinan with River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia at 7:30 AM.

<h3 id="e72">Wu Tiecheng Proposes Revising the Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>▲ Advocates Restoring Compulsory Arbitration</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng made a proposal to the Central Political Conference, stating that the Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law abandoned compulsory arbitration and adopted voluntary arbitration, which led to a situation where, when labor-management disputes arise, the government cannot arbitrate unless the parties request arbitration. Furthermore, in the procedures for submitting to arbitration, the government cannot adopt compulsory measures, allowing both labor and management to act as they please, each going to extremes. He specifically described the various facts and reasons and proposed to re-revise the Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law to restore compulsory arbitration, or to allow Shanghai to formulate separate laws and regulations to adopt compulsory arbitration in order to prevent future troubles. This was discussed at the 319th meeting of the Central Political Conference, and it was resolved to restore the compulsory arbitration method and hand it over to the Legislative Yuan for review. On the 6th, the 196th plenary session of the Legislative Yuan resolved to hand it over to the Labor Law Drafting Committee for review. The following is the proposal of Wu:</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai War, the market has been sluggish, and industries have been exhausted. Both labor and management have suffered. Disputes over wages and working hours and dismissals and suspensions have been heard daily. In the past, it started with direct negotiations between labor and management. If the negotiations failed, disputes would arise. If the disputes continued, both sides would go to extremes. The management would deal with the labor by closing factories and shutting down businesses, and the labor would deal with the management by striking and going slow. Both sides confronted each other with direct action, ignoring mediation and arbitration. Although the reasons for this are varied, the abandonment of compulsory arbitration in the Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law and the adoption of voluntary arbitration, which meant that the arbitration award could not bind the parties to the arbitration and that the government and the courts could not enforce the arbitration award, was a major reason for promoting direct action. If we want to reduce factory closures and strikes, we must establish the government's power to resolve labor-management disputes. And if we want the government to establish the power to resolve labor-management disputes, we must adopt compulsory arbitration. Compulsory arbitration contains several characteristics that are sufficient to establish the government's power. According to the current legislative practice, the main points of compulsory arbitration are as follows: (1) If mediation of a labor-management dispute fails, it must be submitted to arbitration. (2) Witnesses must testify and submit documents. (3) Factory closures and strikes are prohibited during mediation, evidence gathering, and adjudication. (4) Arbitration must be adjudicated and announced. (5) The adjudication must be enforced, and no objections may be raised. Factory closures and strikes are prohibited during the effective period, and violators will be fined or imprisoned. China's Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law was promulgated on March 9th of the 17th year (of the Republic) and was scheduled for a one-year trial period. It was extended repeatedly until March of the 19th year, when it was revised by the Legislative Yuan. The first Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law adopted compulsory arbitration, but the revised version changed it to voluntary arbitration. Article 4 of the first Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law stipulates (If a labor-management dispute arises in the following industries, and the mediation of the event is unsuccessful, it shall be submitted to arbitration: (1) Military manufacturing directly operated by military organs; (2) Water, electricity, and gas businesses that supply public needs; (3) Postal, telegraph, telephone, railway, streetcar, shipping, and public automobile businesses that supply public use). Article 5 also stipulates (If the mediation of a labor-management dispute event other than those mentioned in the preceding article is unsuccessful, it shall be submitted to the arbitration committee for arbitration upon the request of both parties to the dispute. However, if the administrative authorities believe that the dispute is of great importance and has been prolonged for more than a month without resolution, and deem it necessary to arbitrate, even without the request of the parties to the dispute, they may submit the dispute to the arbitration committee for arbitration). According to the above two articles, the government may use compulsory means in the procedures for submitting to arbitration. Article 7 stipulates (The parties to the dispute may not object to the arbitration committee's adjudication. The adjudication in the preceding paragraph shall be regarded as a labor contract between the parties to the dispute. If the duration of the arbitration adjudication regarded as a labor contract in the preceding paragraph is expressly stipulated, neither party may, within the said period, propose to change the adjudication, except for lawful termination of the contract). Article 38 stipulates (A party to the dispute who fails to perform the adjudication regarded as a labor contract as stipulated in Article 7, paragraph 2, shall be fined not more than 200 yuan or detained for not more than 40 days. In the case of the preceding paragraph, the party to the dispute may separately request compulsory execution from the court in accordance with civil laws and regulations). The above two articles stipulate the binding force of the arbitration adjudication. This compulsory arbitration has been in effect for two years and has achieved considerable results. Both labor and management believe that the government has the final power to resolve labor-management disputes, and that all labor-management disputes can be resolved after arbitration. Therefore, the management does not have to resort to closing factories and shutting down businesses, and the labor does not have to resort to striking and going slow. Both labor and management benefit from it. However, the revised Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law hastily abandoned compulsory arbitration and adopted voluntary arbitration. The articles on compulsory arbitration in the old law, such as Articles 4, 5, 7, and 38, no longer exist in the new law, and the added articles clearly stipulate that arbitration cannot compel both parties to submit to and execute it. Article 4 of the revised Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law stipulates (When the mediation of a labor-management dispute event is unsuccessful, it shall be submitted to the arbitration committee for arbitration upon the request of both or one of the parties to the dispute). In submitting to arbitration, the government cannot arbitrate if the parties do not request arbitration. Article 5 also stipulates (If a party to a dispute does not object to the arbitration committee's adjudication within five days after the adjudication is served, the adjudication shall be regarded as a contract between the parties to the dispute. If one of the parties to the dispute is a labor union, it shall be regarded as a labor contract between the parties to the dispute). The parties to the dispute may object to the arbitration adjudication within five days. After an objection is raised, the arbitration adjudication has no binding effect on the parties. And the court, based on the party's lawsuit, may overturn the original adjudication and render a new judgment (see Interpretation No. 723 of the Judicial Yuan). This means that the government is not the final authority for handling labor-management disputes and has no actual power to resolve labor-management disputes. And the court may overturn the adjudication jointly adjudicated by its representative (a court representative also attends the arbitration) and the party and government organs and render a new judgment. The same case is handled twice, causing unnecessary disputes. And the case must go through three trials before it can be finalized. The effect is slow and cumbersome, and it is not a good law for handling serious labor-management disputes. Based on the above facts and reasons, it is imperative to re-revise the Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law and restore compulsory arbitration. Otherwise, please allow Shanghai to formulate separate laws and regulations to adopt compulsory arbitration for trial and to prevent hidden dangers. Is this appropriate? I respectfully request a public decision.</p>

<p>▲ Director of the Construction Department Inspects the Sea Dike: The Hai Dike in the southern part of this county has been in disrepair for many years and is gradually collapsing. Last autumn, a huge tide flooded the area, nearly causing an accident. Local people have repeatedly requested repairs, but due to the large scale of the project and the high cost, although there are plans, they have not been implemented. This year, Xu Baikui, the director of the Construction Bureau, is actively proceeding with the repairs, uniting all sectors of society to discuss the repairs. The third section of the cement project in Jinshan Mouth and other places in this county is contracted by the Shanghai Construction Factory. Since the start of construction, under the supervision of Director Xu, construction has been carried out quickly and is progressing very rapidly. The completion date is approaching. Dong Xiujia, the director of the Construction Department, attaches great importance to the dike project. He arrived in Songjiang today (the 8th). The Songjiang Steamship of the Bianli Steamship Company, hired by the Construction Bureau, waited for Director Dong at the station. Director Xu greeted him at the station at about 10:00 AM and accompanied him to the bureau. After a brief rest, he accompanied him on the ship and went to inspect the sea dike in Shanyang, Jinshan Mouth, Tuolin, and other places, making a week-long inspection. He will return to Songjiang that evening.</p>

<p>▲ A Severe Epidemic in Chonggu Town: Chonggu Town in the ninth district of this county is a prosperous market town with a large population. Since the beginning of summer, the weather has been dry, leading to a widespread epidemic. Patients experience vomiting and diarrhea, and their minds quickly become unclear. Even doctors are at a loss. For example, the housewife of Guangfengyi in the town and Sheng Fuxing of Zhang Gongxing have both died from morning to evening. Currently, twenty to thirty people have died from the epidemic. If no remedies are quickly sought, it is feared that the epidemic will spread further.</p>

<p>▲ Requesting the Prohibition of Evil Educational Practices: In this county, before the founding of the Republic, there was a kind of evil practice. Those with a little power in the area could avoid paying silver and grain taxes. After the founding of the Republic, this custom gradually disappeared, but new evil practices have emerged, mostly in rural areas. The children of local thugs and ruffians who go to school often do not pay tuition. If the principal and teachers urge them to pay, they will be angered, or they will collude with accomplices to stir up trouble, create all kinds of rumors, fabricate false accusations, or support unqualified youths to become principals and teachers, misleading students, or establish private schools to hinder the progress of public schools, in order to protect their jobs. Principals and teachers who want to keep their jobs have no choice but to let them not pay and secretly swallow their grievances, watching as public and private interests are jeopardized, and the school spirit deteriorates as a result. The future of the school is also bleak. There is only the name of a school, but no real education. Local enthusiasts, fearing the rampage of these people, mostly sit idly by. Shi Qinglin, Chen Yuanzhu, Hu Xisen, and others in this county cannot bear to see these people destroy this county's education, and they have requested the county government to strictly investigate and prohibit them in order to maintain the school and achieve the popularization of education.</p>

<p>▲ Unscrupulous Merchants Import Inferior Goods: A certain unscrupulous merchant in a certain clothing store on Zhongshi Main Street in the city has recently imported a large number of inferior cloths. This was discovered by the "Blood Soul Extermination Group" of this county, which has sent him a bomb as a serious warning and has also requested the Public Security Bureau not to interfere. It is said that the unscrupulous merchant was quite alarmed after receiving the letter.</p>
<p>▲ Director of the Education Bureau Accused: Sun Xinyuan, the director of the Danyang Education Bureau, has been repeatedly accused. The Education Department has specially sent Provincial Supervisor Feng Ce to Danyang to investigate. It is said that Supervisor Feng is conducting a detailed investigation into the income and expenditure of the bureau's education funds, as well as personnel and administrative issues, and plans to convene the plaintiffs who accused Sun to talk in order to seek a fair resolution.</p>
<p>▲ The Danli Steamer Robbed: The Danli Steamer was sailing near Jintan yesterday when a group of bandits suddenly opened fire and ordered the steamer to stop. They jumped on board and searched and robbed at will. After checking the passengers, it was found that clothing and silver dollars worth about 800 yuan were lost. The case has now been reported to the police for investigation.</p>

<p>▲The Jiangsu Industrial Bureau Loans Cotton Yarn: Since the disasters in Jiangsu Province, the number of unemployed workers in various places has gradually increased. In Zhenjiang, most of the former cloth factories have now closed. According to a survey by the Industry Bureau, there are more than 100 weaving machines that have stopped operating. In order to provide relief to these unemployed workers, officials were sent to the Dasheng Yarn Factory to negotiate borrowing 50 boxes of yarn to lend to the machine owners to recruit workers and resume production. After they weave the cloth, the yarn cost will be repaid, or the cloth will be used as collateral. It is estimated that it can accommodate more than 200 workers. It is also planned to convene representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, the silk and cloth industry guild, and machine owners to form a Zhenjiang Cotton Weaving Industry Guidance Committee to guide the implementation. If it can be implemented effectively, it will be extended to other places. However, the yarn cost must be repaid three months after the loan is issued. Because the yarn produced by the Dasheng Yarn Factory has already been mortgaged to the banking syndicate, the yarn price still needs to be paid in advance. After consultation with the local Central Bank, it was agreed to use the original 40,000 taels of official shares of the factory in the province to borrow 20,000 yuan in cash for temporary payment of the yarn price. The Dasheng Yarn Factory also specially agreed to reduce the price by 10 yuan per box to pay for bank interest. Now that these shares are under the custody of the Finance Bureau, a special request was made at yesterday's provincial government committee meeting to order the allocation of 40,000 taels of face value for application. After the yarn price is cleared in the future, these shares will be returned in full. The resolution was passed.</p>

It is also learned that the Huainan Deputy Transport Office will be merged into the Yangzhou Branch. Hu Xingchi, the Deputy Transport Commissioner, has left Yangzhou today. The current manager of the Yangzhou Branch, Ma Taiwei, will return to the Dongtai Branch after handing over his duties.

<h3 id="e80">Baseball Friendship Match: China Defeats McLing <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲China Wins 10 to 7 in the Seventh Inning</p>
<p>▲Wonderful Performance, Extremely Interesting</p>
<p>In the friendly match between the Chinese baseball team and the McLing second team, McLing won the first two times. After this setback, the Chinese team strived to rejuvenate and hoped for a good result. In the third battle yesterday, they finally achieved their wish. The Chinese team won 10 to 7. This is the first masterpiece since the establishment of the Chinese team. All the players were energetic and overjoyed. If this continues, it is very optimistic. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲China Gets Off to a Good Start: At 3:30 in the afternoon, the stands of the baseball field were filled with four or five hundred spectators. China started the attack first. Liang Chengson succeeded in one hit, and the ball flew to the center field, reaching third base. Li Beiliang followed. Due to the opponent's mistake, Liang returned to home base, and Li reached second base. Later, two people were killed, but Zhang Zhaoyuan, Liang Fuchu, and Zhang Guoxun still tried to advance, occupying all bases, which was a very good situation. Unexpectedly, when Wei Zongtang hit the ball, the ball was caught by the McLing pitcher and sent to home base. Li Beiliang was blocked. The overall situation changed. Under this situation, China only scored one point, which was a pity. China then changed to defense. McLing batted but did not score anything.</p>
<p>▲McLing's Surprise Attack: In the second inning, China attacked again. An Lesheng entered the field, but the ball was not hit far, but the McLing shortstop made a mistake, and An fortunately reached second base. Jin Zhendong and Li Wenxuan assisted him, and An returned to home base, scoring one point. After the change of lineup, McLing was very aggressive and made continuous hits. Freeman got on base with four balls, and Le Fa hit a long ball, flying over the wire net to the right field, becoming a triple. Freeman then returned to home base. After that, McLing hit every ball, and the momentum was extremely strong. Ma Lun, Boser, and Li successively returned to home base. In total, McLing scored four points, and China fell behind 2 to 4.</p>
<p>▲Masterpiece of the Third Inning: In the top of the third inning, both sides had masterpieces. China attacked first. Liang Fuchu hit a single and reached base, as did Liang Chengson. Wei Zongtang made a sacrifice hit, and Chengson returned quickly, scoring one point. Guoxun crossed to second base, Jin Zhendong hit a long ball, flying to the left field, for a single. Guoxun also returned to home base. Li Wenxuan hit a fastball to the right field, and Jin Zhendong reached third base. Taking advantage of McLing's mistake, he returned to home base. Chengson also got another single, and Li Wenxuan also returned to home base, scoring a total of five points. After the change of lineup, McLing suffered a major setback and launched an active counterattack. Le Fa hit the center field, and the center fielder made a mistake. Nabul and Freeman at second and third bases each returned to home base. Later, Ma Lun hit a single, and Le Fa also returned, scoring three points. In total, the result of the first three innings was a tie of 7 to 7.</p>
<p>▲Zero for Both Sides in the Fourth and Fifth Innings: In the fourth inning, after two Chinese players were killed, they filled the bases with hope, but failed to get a single and gave up. McLing also scored nothing in this inning. China had zero in the fifth inning. McLing attacked hard. China relied on the spirit of individual struggle and killed three people, which was wonderful and easy.</p>
<p>▲China Adds Two More Points: In the top of the sixth inning, Wei Zongtang hit the ball and got on base first. Li Beiliang replaced him as a runner. An Lesheng followed. Although the ball he hit was not very far, he reached second base due to a mistake in the right field. Li Wenxuan tried his best. Li Beiliang ran back and was blocked. Liang Fuchu made a single, and An and Li returned to home base, and Liang reached third base. In the bottom of the inning, McLing was the hitter, but was killed by China in a row, which was extremely fast and wonderful.</p>
<p>▲McLing Fails After Hard Battle: Zhang Zhaoyuan and Zhang Guoxun of China successively reached base. Wei Zongtang once again embraced the principle of sacrifice, gently touched the ball, and Zhang Zhaoyuan returned to home base in a hurry, adding one point. After the change of field, McLing continued to work hard and made a final effort. Although they had advanced to second base, they were eventually killed by China. As a result, China won 10 to 7. In this battle, China made a total of 15 singles, while McLing had 10. McLing made as many as 11 errors, while China had only three. The scores, hits, and lineup of the two teams are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hits: 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 — 15 ▲China: 1 1 5 0 0 2 1 — 10 points Innings: (1 2 3 4 5 6 7) ▲McLing: 0 4 3 0 0 0 0 — 7 points Hits: 0 2 4 1 1 0 2 — 10 hits (China Lineup) (McLing Lineup)</p>

<p>The seventh match of the Xianfang Cup was held as scheduled yesterday. However, according to Mr. Lu Xiniu, the secretary of the Shanghai Chinese Tennis Association, the match report forms of each team are often submitted beyond the prescribed time. Today, it is even more difficult. It is hoped that each team will love themselves and others in the future. It is deeply hoped and prayed.</p>
<p>The singles lineup of China has been slightly changed, and it is a pity that it cannot completely defeat Xia Guang. The first doubles match between Zhu and will be rescheduled. Currently, Zhong Liangdeguang (Zhong) wins Guo Pengnian (Xia) 7-5, 6-1, 6-3. Wang Yuanzhao (Xia) wins Xu Demin (Zhong) 2-6, 8-6, 6-1.

<p>Third Rotary Cup: China Wins the Final Right, British and American Forces Equal</p>
<p>▲Chinese Doubles Wins Again Against Portugal</p>
<p>▲British Doubles Wins Against America, Situation Equal</p>
<p>The singles match between the British and American teams against Portugal was cancelled this afternoon.</p>
<p>In the third Rotary Cup International Tennis Tournament, the Chinese doubles defeated Portugal in straight sets yesterday to win the final. At the same time, the British doubles defeated the United States, creating an equal situation. Starting at 4:30 this afternoon, there will be two singles matches between Britain and the United States. The remaining two singles matches between China and Portugal were cancelled with the consent of both parties because the victory was already determined.</p>
<h3 id="e82">(1) China's Invincible Combination Against Portugal <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Lin Baohua, Jiang Daozhang (China) 6-4, 6-1, 6-4 Cola Sha, Kao Siluan (Portugal)</p>
<p>After Britain's victory over the United States, the audience's emotions were greatly boosted. When the Chinese players Lin Baozhang and Jiang Daozhang strode into the arena, they were greeted with applause. Before long, the Portuguese players also came to the arena. Everyone calmed down and watched the battle.</p>
<p>▲Engraved Articles: In the first set, China and Portugal attacked each other fiercely, neither side yielding. The Lin-Jiang doubles team, known for its fame, also found it difficult to gain an advantage. The strategies of both sides were exactly the same, making great use of sharp serves and waiting for the opponent to counterattack. The other person blocked it and took advantage of the situation to win. Jiang won the first game by relying on this method. Portugal followed suit and succeeded. Thus, the situation of 1-1 to 4-4 was like engraved articles, all the same. In the ninth game, Jiang won again, and in the tenth game, Cola Sha served. At first, he still had the advantage, but Lin's violent shot broke the routine and suddenly changed the situation. As a result, China won 6-4.</p>
<p>▲Head-on Blow: In the second set, the gap between China and Portugal was huge. The former launched a head-on blow, sparing no effort, while the latter was weakened and confused, not knowing what to do. The brilliant masterpiece of one serve and one block seemed to be the exclusive patent of the former. In the second game, Portugal spent all its efforts to win one game, while the rest were won by us. China won again 6-1.</p>
<p>▲The Last Scene: In the third set, the Portuguese side cheered up a bit. At first, they were in a difficult situation, trailing 1-3. When they worked hard, the situation gradually changed.

<h3 id="e83">(2) British Victory Over the United States, Always on Top <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Hui Te, Turner (England) 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 Shi Kuiya, Bai Lando (America)</p>
<p>On the first day, the United States won the singles against England. Yesterday, England won the doubles against the United States. Each won one group, and the high and low could not be distinguished. Looking at the overall performance of both sides yesterday, the British veteran Hui Te was agile and majestic. Young juniors found it difficult to compete with him. He was the most special person among the four. Shi Kuiya and Turner also had excellent performances. Only Shi's partner, Bai Lando, performed poorly. The failure of the United States lies here. In the first set, Shi opened the serve and won the first game. Hui Te soon regained the second game. Suddenly, after 1-2, England won four consecutive games, and the winning momentum was determined. They finally won 6-4. In the second set, England took the lead and benefited from the transition. The United States tried to catch up, but failed and lost again 4-6. In the third set, the British ball momentum was even stronger, and the United States' efforts were ineffective. In the end, the victory belonged to England with 6-3.</p>

<p>▲Chen Shizhen and Zhong Lingxiu are additionally hired as committee members</p>
<p>▲91 members from 19 provinces and cities have registered</p>
<p>The National Sports Conference is scheduled to be held at the Nanjing Lizhi Society starting on the 16th of this month. The conference period was originally set for July. In the future, depending on the number of motions, it may be extended by a few days, which is still difficult to determine. Generally, during the conference, there will be a general meeting in the morning and review meetings and group meetings in the afternoon. The preparatory committee of the association originally hired Chu Minyi, Zhang Zhijiang, Zhou Yawei, Wu Yunrui, Huang Mingdao, Guo Xinsong, Gu Shusen, Li Zheng, Peng Baichuan and other nine people. Now, Chen Shizhen and Zhong Lingxiu have been additionally hired, for a total of eleven people. (In fact, there are still nine people because Guo Xinsong, the Director of Higher Education, is on leave, and is currently being replaced by Chen Shizhen, a counselor. Li Zheng, the Director of Social Education, has gone to the Beijing Normal University and is temporarily being concurrently handled by Zhong Lingxiu, the section chief.) The association expects more than 100 members to attend the meeting. A check as of the 6th shows that the members who have sent letters to participate and have designated representatives include 11 preparatory committee members, 22 experts invited from various places, 3 scheme formulation committee members, and representatives from various agencies (such as the Ministry of Interior, Railways, Industry, Communications, Training General Supervision, Chinese Boy Scout Command, etc.), representatives from the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities, representatives from national martial arts halls, and directors of physical education from colleges and universities. The total is 55 people. The above statistics are 91 people (excluding the employees and secretaries of the Ministry of Education). Except for Rehe, which has sent a letter stating that it will not send representatives due to special circumstances, Liangdu, Xinjiang, Sichuan, and the three northeastern provinces have not yet sent letters informing them of the representatives who will attend the meeting. The provinces and cities that have reported and designated representatives are Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, Qinghai, Chahar, Yunnan, Gansu, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hubei, Qingdao, Anhui, Guizhou, Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Suiyuan, and other 19 provinces and cities. The Ministry of Education previously issued an order to the Education Departments and Bureaus of various provinces and cities, requesting them to forward it to the provincial, municipal, and registered private universities or independent colleges, and various physical education specialty schools to comply with the provisions of Article 2, and quickly select the members who should be sent, and submit their names and resumes to the Ministry of Education before August 1. On the 6th, the Ministry of Education received letters from two universities in a certain city stating that they had not received notification from the city bureau. The Ministry of Education has ordered the city bureau to investigate and supplement the notification. For any province or city with the same omission, it is hoped that they will make up for it as soon as possible due to the approaching conference period, so as not to delay the matter. In order to promote the use of domestic sports equipment, the association has had the Shanghai Standard Sports Equipment Company transport more than 200 kinds of domestic sports equipment to be displayed at the conference. If there are other domestic sports equipment companies with equipment to display, they can directly contact the association.</p>

<p>▲ 100-Meter Freestyle Final</p>
<p>▲ Track and Field Events to Conclude Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲ Culminating with the Marathon Race</p>
<p>A special dispatch from the Rengo News Agency in Los Angeles on the 6th reports that tomorrow, the ninth day of the Games, is the final day for track and field events. It begins with the finals of the 400-meter relay and the 1600-meter relay. Finally, at 3:00 PM, the marathon race, the finale of the Games, will be held and is expected to conclude by 5:30 PM, marking the end of all track and field events. Additionally, there are the women's high jump and the women's 400-meter relay finals.</p>
<p>The marathon will start at 3:00 PM from the Olympic Stadium, proceeding straight along San Pedro Street, turning right at Franklin Avenue, turning left onto Western Avenue, then left again onto Moneta Avenue, exiting onto Vermont Avenue, and then forming a square in Greater Los Angeles via Van Ness Avenue. It goes from Inglewood onto Western and then onto Palos Verdes Drive. The Olympic Village will be visible on the left. Finally, it enters the stadium via Figueroa Street. The total distance is 26 and 1/4 miles, meeting the prescribed distance. Hopeful runners for the marathon include the previous winner, Jean Villepeaux (France), Plaza (Chile), Mattlin (Finland), Lane (USA), and Tsuda (Japan). Other promising runners include Kwon (Japan), Kim (Japan), Adkins (USA), Meyers (Canada), and Johanson (Sweden). Their times are all around 2 hours 32 and 1/3 minutes. Thus, Tsuda (Japan) and Villepeaux will compete for first place. However, in the marathon, unknown athletes often create new records, like Jaffe in the previous games, who emerged like a comet. He was an unknown young man. Perhaps a new athlete will emerge this year. The 100-meter freestyle final in swimming is the highlight of tomorrow's events. In today's semi-finals, Japan and the U.S. each had three athletes advance, so tomorrow's competition will be fierce. Miyazaki Koji, the 16-year-old athlete from Hamamatsu Daiichi Middle School's fourth grade who broke the world record held by the giant Weissmuller, will compete. Will Kahili win, or will Miyazaki win? Everyone expects Miyazaki to win.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's new event is Lacrosse, a unique American-style ball game.</p>

<p>The Wusong Merchant Marine School, under the Ministry of Communications, reopened on May 28th after Xia Sunpeng was appointed as the principal by the Ministry of Communications in May. There are over two hundred students. Its funding comes from one-third of the import ship taxes, allocated to the school and managed by a specially formed management committee. The entire faculty consists of about forty members. Since the outbreak of the war, the salaries for March, April, and May have not been paid. The faculty has repeatedly requested payment since the reopening, but without success. In July, the faculty formed a union and demanded their salaries from the principal. Xia Sunpeng forwarded the request to the Ministry of Communications, which ruled that the salaries for March and April would not be paid as they were during the school closure period. The faculty held a second general meeting and resolved: (1) to request the Ministry to first pay the May salaries; (2) if the salaries for March and April were not resolved by the end of July, they would go on strike on August 1st. At the same time, faculty members Meng Xian, Wang Gui, Sun Xudaqing, and others were chosen to meet with the principal, who would forward the request to the Ministry. Fearing a strike on August 1st, the Ministry first issued a reply through the Navigation Administration Department, earnestly advising everyone to consider the overall situation, postpone the strike temporarily, and await the Ministry's review and approval of a plan for compliance. The faculty has patiently waited, but has not yet received a reply.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Gauze lamp shade! Gauze lamp shade! Many moths are hovering and circling around you! In summer, to isolate flies from food, it is necessary to add a gauze cover; especially for cooked meat, the aroma of meat is overflowing, which has a special magic power to attract flies. The gauze cover on cooked meat is necessary among the necessary.</p>
<p>The foolish flies are coming! There is a target inside the gauze cover. You can see it, and you can smell it, but you just can't satisfy the physiological requirements of the flies. Except hovering and circling around the gauze cover, there is no other way.</p>
<p>Is this the temptation of meat? No, this is the unrequited love of flies, not the temptation of meat. A bowl of cooked meat inside the gauze cover has no consciousness and will not move by itself; even if the foolish flies unrequitedly love to death, it is the fault of the foolish flies and not the fault of the meat.</p>
<p>In the park, under the green shade, by the evening breeze, there are many spirits and flesh moving inside the gauze cover! This gauze cover is not an iron gauze cover, but a georgette shirt that fully reveals the skin.</p>
<p>The foolish flies are coming! There is a target inside the gauze cover. You can see it, and you can smell it, and maybe you can satisfy the physiological requirements of the flies. Therefore, the flies are buzzing and saying: I linger for a long time, I can't bear to leave.</p>
<p>Is this the unrequited love of flies? No, this is the temptation of the flesh, not the unrequited love of flies. The spirit and flesh inside the georgette gauze cover are conscious and will move by themselves. In the park, under the green shade, by the evening breeze, the flesh is sending out invitations to the flies.</p>
<p>Despicable flesh! Poor foolish flies!</p>

<p>— Qian</p>
<p>I have a friend. He graduated from Huangpu Military Academy. I have been separated from him for several years. One day, I accidentally met him in Shanghai. It turns out that he is now serving as a military instructor at a certain university.</p>
<p>I said, (You have been out of touch since you graduated from military school. You have had a lot of experience in these few years.)</p>
<p>He said, (I have had a lot of experience in these years. I have been to Beijing, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Chengdu, Wuhan, and other places. But my experience has made me very disheartened. Let me tell you simply.</p>
<p>(After I graduated, I was assigned to a certain division as a trainee, first as a platoon leader, and later promoted to company commander. Although I was only a junior officer, I was very satisfied with my life at this time.</p>
<p>(Later, due to changes in the environment, I also left a certain division and ran around. As a result, unexpectedly, I became the director of the anti-smoking bureau of a certain county in Hubei. I don't like money. But at this time, there was so much money. Three or five thousand a month is simply nothing. My subordinates would stuff thousands into their pockets every month. Besides, there were more than a dozen friends gathered around you. Clothing, food, pocket money, everything must be supplied by you. I really hated this kind of life. I said, okay, let you do it. So soon I resigned from my position.</p>
<p>After I resigned, I went to several places. Later, I became a liaison staff officer of a certain division. The liaison staff officer is responsible for the liaison between the military divisions. The position is very high. When you go to the division headquarters, you are at the same level as the division commander. When you go to the military headquarters, you are at the same level as the military commander. The salary is also very generous. But even though there is a lot of money, you can't save a penny. Why? Because I am a liaison staff officer, I have to socialize. Otherwise, I can't get in touch. And the worst thing in the army is that you can't socialize without (mahjong). Alas. When I think of my life at this time, I really feel sad. When I wake up in the morning, the affairs are very clear. But when I want to read a book, someone comes. They don't come to deliver any official business. It's just that A asks you to find a job. B asks you to intercede. C asks you to do sports. D comes to chat with you. A day's work is spent on these trivial matters. At four o'clock in the afternoon, a call comes from a certain military headquarters. A call comes from a certain division headquarters. Go to a certain hotel to open a room. Go to a certain hotel to play mahjong. You have to go. And the people who play mahjong with me have their names in the newspapers. Military commander. Division commander. Chief of staff. They are all big figures. And playing cards in the army is different from ordinary playing cards. The winnings and losses are not thirty or fifty. At least three hundred or five hundred. Do you think I can get along with them? From this, I came to a conclusion. That is, great figures live a (non-human life). I really hated it. I thought, (I'd better go back). So soon I resigned and came to a certain university as a military instructor through a friend's introduction. Of course, the salary is not as much as it was then. But there is no socializing and no trouble. My heart is much clearer.)</p>

<p>The current society is extremely unstable. There is always the danger of unemployment. Even if you can get a job in the future, it is often used for something other than your talent. I am worried about it. I will not hesitate to be crude and plan for you in advance. I respectfully inform all circles for selection.</p>
<p>▲ Party and national dignitaries can open referral shops, specializing in introducing famous doctors, calligraphers, painters, and astrologers, etc. ▲ Teachers can crawl along the road and act as refugees, because they can use their blackboard writing skills to write on cement, which is more than enough.</p>
<p>▲ Long-distance runners can be rickshaw pullers, because their posture and pace are consistent.</p>
<p>▲ Officials can reclaim land because they have a special research on land.</p>
<p>▲ Prostitutes can be policemen because their legs are very good at standing, and they are not afraid of wind and rain, and they do not change with cold and heat. Their spirit is especially admirable. Now the French Concession strictly prohibits kidnapping, and the Chinese Concession relies entirely on the police to maintain order. Thinking about their need for talent, why don't prostitutes try it? ▲ Xiao Ququ Ququ relies on writing to make a living. He can set up a fortune-telling stall. In case the government strictly eliminates superstition, then he will change a sign that says writing letters for others, which can guarantee no wrong words.

<p>— Li Hongbin</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Li is from Shandong and serves as a soldier in Sichuan. In the spring of the seventeenth year, he returned to his hometown due to an event. He passed through Zhangde, Henan on the way. As it was getting dark, he stayed at a small inn in Wuyi Village. There were already three travelers there. He went to bed at midnight, but he had not yet fallen asleep. Suddenly, he heard a noisy human voice. He couldn't distinguish what they were saying. He was startled and looked up, but he saw dozens of people gathering and talking, looking very angry. He asked the innkeeper. He said, "Guests are from faraway villages, so it doesn't matter if I tell you. But be careful not to leak it out. I'm afraid it will be unfavorable to everyone. There are about five hundred households in our village, which are divided into the Tianmen and Red Spear Associations. I belong to the Tianmen Association. Whenever something happens in the village, the leaders of the two associations discuss it before acting. They respect each other and there have never been any conflicts. However, three days ago, twelve deserters entered the village with guns and horses, acting violently. They could not be reasoned with. The two associations jointly killed them. Afterwards, the Tianmen Association planned to get their guns, while the Red Spear Association would get their horses. The Red Spear Association insisted on half of the guns and horses. They discussed for three days but could not decide. Now they have broken up and are preparing for war. We are members of the association, so we should go through the number. Unfortunately, you have also encountered this robbery. Only you." Mr. Li argued, "Then can we avoid it?" The innkeeper said, "It is impossible to escape. At this time, spies are lurking everywhere. No one can cross the Leichi pool. However, I will do my best to help you plan it." So he went to tell the leaders of the two associations. The leaders of the associations agreed to it. So each association sent someone to send them out with lanterns and weapons. After passing through Gang Kafa, they all said that they were ordered to send guests. They checked carefully and then let them go. When they were half a mile away from the village, the sender said, "You</p>
<p>should go quickly. There will be no obstacles in the future."</p>
<p>A month later, Mr. Li finished his work and went to Sichuan. He passed through the village again. He arrived at the small inn. The door was deserted and there was no human voice. He entered the house. Only an old woman was cooking by the stove. Mr. Li said his intention and asked about the innkeeper. The old woman suddenly burst into tears and said, "About three hours after you left that night, the war broke out. As a result, the Tianmen Association was defeated. My husband and three sons and two daughters-in-law all died. The family was broken and destroyed.</p>
<p>Business has been suspended for a long time. I can't accommodate distinguished guests." Mr. Li sighed and walked out. The sound of sobbing has not yet stopped. Alas, what a tragedy.</p>

<p>— Ying</p>
<p>(Saving the country doesn't forget love. Love doesn't forget saving the country.) This is a paraphrase of (saving the country doesn't forget reading. Reading doesn't forget saving the country.) This is the fashionable talk of a group of young men and women. On the surface, it seems that the meaning of the two sentences is the same. In fact, when the words change, the meaning is very different. Because the previous sentence (saving the country doesn't forget love.) has to save the country and still can't forget love. It is in line with the old saying (heroes are short of breath. Children's love is long.) As a result, his (her) work of saving the country. Did not succeed. I am afraid it will also be a failure. The next sentence (love doesn't forget saving the country.) He (she) can wake up from the maze of love. Go to save the country. He (she) must understand that love is narrow love. Saving the country is broad love. How great this kind of thinking is.</p>
<p>Recently, Tianyi Company produced a sound film (Two Orphans in the Battlefield.) It is to elaborate on the meaning of (love does not forget to save the country). Two women. In the midst of chaos and displacement. Love the same man. Due to various environmental factors. Almost caused a love triangle tragedy. But as a result, she and he both abandoned their private love. Go to the national crisis together. The story has many twists and turns. Extremely happy and sad. The content is tragic and exciting. It is inspiring and exciting. Young men and women who like to talk about love now. It is necessary to watch this film.</p>

<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>(31) Brick and Tile Factory</p>
<p>Since French Red Ping Chain-style tiles were imported into China, our country's old green clay bricks and tiles have been almost eliminated. Therefore, we had to adapt to the changes of the times and imitate them. New-style bricks and tiles have emerged as the times require.</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, Zhu Zhiyao, a Shanghai merchant, founded a kiln factory in Sanlintang, Pudong. He built German-style kilns and imitated bricks and tiles. Although it failed soon, it was the beginning of Shanghai's mechanized brick and tile manufacturing. Afterwards, there were Ruihe Brick and Tile Company in Xiaoshadu, Guanghua Pattern Brick Factory in Yongxing Road, Huada Brick and Tile Factory in Beixinjing, Fuji Porcelain Company, Taishan Brick and Tile Company No. 2 Factory in Xinlonghua, Xinda Kiln Factory in Tangwan, and Yizhong Ceramic Tile Factory in Pudong. Dazhong Brick and Tile Factory. Other factories such as Fakang Zhonghe Xiechang Hezhong Xingye, etc., either produce red tiles and green tiles, or produce road bricks and fire bricks, or produce mosaic ceramic tiles. Mosaic is especially a necessity of the times. Fuji and Yizhong products are better and sell well for a while.</p>
<p>Foreigners have established brick and tile factories in Shanghai, including the Yipin Factory opened by Belgian merchants, and the China Cement Brick and Tile Company opened by British merchants. Cement bricks and tiles are strong, light, and sponge-like in shape. They are especially suitable for building high-rise buildings. Unfortunately, their processes and materials are kept strictly confidential and cannot be investigated. I sincerely hope that those who study the brick and tile industry will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>The raw materials for mechanized bricks and tiles are five kinds of yellow mud, ore mud, cement, coal slag, porcelain clay. The products are green tiles, red tiles, red bricks, patterned bricks, road bricks, fire bricks, ceramic tiles, facing bricks, cylinder bricks, hollow bricks, coal slag bricks, and mosaic. The length of the bricks and the size of the price are not uniform. Sales are mostly in this port. Hankou, Nanjing, and Tianjin are second. In recent years, the construction industry has made great progress. This industry is booming. Although Japanese bricks and tiles are not as good as national goods in terms of workmanship and materials, they are sometimes found on the market. The general public does not know the pros and cons and buys them. Shanghai has a Shandong Kiln Industry Company, which is the Japanese brick and tile management office. (End)</p>

<p>— Buchu Tingcao Zhaifu</p>
<p>Seventy-five</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said: (There are many more amazing facts. There are about seven million students in public and private primary schools across the country: there are at least seven million students in old-style private schools. The total cost of these 14 million primary school students is at least 100 million yuan per year. This 100 million yuan is completely consumed under traditional education. Primary school students are too young, so they cannot fully produce, but raising a few chickens, planting a few vegetables, planting a few trees, and spinning a few kilograms of yarn should not be considered excessive. Otherwise, sweeping and wiping the table and washing their own clothes will save adults a lot of energy and move it to production. If each primary school student earns one yuan per year with their own labor, it will be 14 million yuan, and if they earn ten yuan, it will be 140 million yuan. According to my observation, if the power of children is guided properly, it can create unexpected miracles. Children can do a little small production and small construction. The creation of the Republic of China cannot be without these small workers. Look at the financial report from July 1, 1929 to June 30, 1930. The national treasury expenditure in this year was 49,507,000 yuan, of which 49.6% was military expenditure, which is 24,544,000 yuan. This 24,544,000 yuan is spent on military affairs every year, and if it continues to be spent for ten years, it will be 245,440,000 yuan. This sum of money is not only purely consumption but also destroys production. According to the statistics in September of the nineteenth year, there were 2,599,200 formal troops in the country, not including informal troops. Most of these two million five hundred and ninety-nine thousand people are farmers, who could originally produce, but as soon as they enter the army, they immediately become consumers. More soldiers cannot resist foreign insults, and there will inevitably be internal strife. Once internal strife comes, workers cannot do me, farmers cannot cultivate the land, and productivity is destroyed again. The country's raising of soldiers is like hiring a bodyguard. Hiring a bodyguard is only the business of the rich. The poor can only protect themselves, so how can they afford to hire a bodyguard. China is a poor country, and it is impossible to afford to feed soldiers who eat by being soldiers. If we can use this 245 million yuan of military expenditure as production capital and turn these 2.6 million soldiers into productive workers, then what a great construction power it would be!)</p>

<h3 id="e108">Finance The Gold Market Fluctuated Slightly Last Week <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Both Sides Were in a Standoff</p>
<p>Down Four Taels from the Previous Week</p>
<p>Last week, the gold market benchmark price saw slight changes, appearing to hover, but without any major disturbances. The daily difference was at most six taels. Both the long and short positions were relatively balanced. Initially, the silver market's reported gains slightly weakened, with the opening price for September at 745.5 taels, down eight qian. Subsequently, both silver prices and exchange rates rose. However, Shanghai's exchange rates moved in the opposite direction, becoming strained. With the addition of Guangbang Hengxing and others covering their short positions, it seemed like an upward trend was developing. However, sellers remained active, and the price fluctuated uncertainly, creating a volatile situation. On Tuesday, the price rose to 746.2 qian. By Friday, the situation changed dramatically, and the market almost saw a sharp decline, mainly due to the steep fall in exchange rates. This affected the first order delivery significantly, and the U.S. dollar exchange rate also showed signs of easing. Selling pressure increased in the market, and prices plummeted to 735.6 qian. Although the silver market rose on Saturday, exchange rates continued to fall sharply by three fen, reaching 2.75 fen. However, the U.S. dollar exchange rate surged, reversing the trend from the previous day, rising above 740 taels, eventually reaching 42.3 qian (the grey market price even reached 43.5 qian). Comparing the opening and closing prices of this week, there was a drop of 3.2 qian, with a range of 11.6 qian. Compared to the end of the previous week, the overall drop was 4 taels. As for the British and American silver markets, they continued to rise, leading to an increase of two gears in the local British gold exchange rate (half a penny), while the U.S. dollar only increased by .375. The domestic British gold rose by .375, while the U.S. dollar only recovered by .125, mainly due to the sharp fall in exchange rates. Gold firms mostly sold, while arbitrage transactions were done, but the prices were somewhat far apart. For near-term delivery, it was above 50 taels, and for long-term delivery, it was about 40 taels. Various firms were shorting 4-5 million U.S. dollars, with the initial settlement price at over 70 taels, eventually falling to over 60 taels. The British and American exchange rates initially rose repeatedly, but then fell frequently. The total fall of the British pound against the U.S. dollar was 3.875, and the overall decline of the U.S. dollar was more than four fen. Spot gold is now being gradually absorbed by the Central Bank, or those engaging in arbitrage with U.S. dollars are adding 8-9 taels based on the actual cost. It is also found that the recent volume of gold transactions is approximately 22,000 contracts, with Yuanxingyong still holding the majority of long positions, accounting for about 4,400 contracts, standing in contrast to the short positions held by Hengxing. Run Chang Yu Yifeng Yong only have slightly more than 1,000 contracts, Qianchangxiang about 2,000, Yuandayong only a few hundred, while Zhaofengchang is short 1,500-1,600 contracts. Dadecheng Yifeng and others also hold short positions. The Dalian Gang is slightly long, but the number of contracts held by each firm has decreased compared to the previous week, as the public bonds for August have already been settled. The general situation of the past week is summarized below:</p>
<p>▲Monday: Due to the bank summer vacation, gold transactions were suspended. However, there was no change in the information from the London telegraph. The U.S. silver market also did not fluctuate. Exchange rates returned to .375.</p>
<p>▲Tuesday: No news from the London telegraph, the U.S. silver market rose .125, while HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The domestic market trended weaker. As for the gold market, it was business as usual. The opening price fell by eight qian, to 745.5 taels. Subsequently, due to buying activity, it rose to 46.2 qian. Afterwards, the exchange market weakened, and selling pressure increased. The price fell to 40 taels, then to 41 taels. The afternoon closing price was 40.02 qian. The afternoon opening price was 40 taels. Later, Hengxing repeatedly bought in, pushing the price to 42.8 qian. The closing price was 42 qian, continuing to fall 400,003 qian compared to the previous Saturday. The highest price of the day was 46.2 qian, and the lowest was 40 taels, a difference of 6.2 qian. Public bonds were settled as usual today (August spot), totaling 5,600 contracts. It was also reported that Shoufengyong settled 4,900 contracts with the Central Bank.</p>
<p>▲Wednesday: The London telegraph rose .0625 repeatedly, the U.S. silver market rose .125, the first order delivery remained unchanged, and the U.S. dollar was listed up .125, as exchange rates had been rising for three days. However, the internal market seemed tight, with a clear divergence between the official and unofficial markets. The gold market opened slightly lower by two qian, at 41.8 qian. Hengxing was the first to take action and buy, followed by 1.6 qian. Subsequently, the market rose by three taels, as there were many buyers, reaching 44.8 qian. Then, due to the exchange market weakening, it fell to 41.7 qian at noon. Eventually, it rose, with buyers remaining active and the exchange market improving, reaching 45 taels. It then closed at 44.8 qian, a rebound of 2.8 qian compared to the previous day. The daily fluctuation was only 3-4 taels, with a maximum of 45 taels and a minimum of 41.6 qian. The afternoon was closed for rest due to the heat.</p>
<p>▲Thursday: The London telegraph fell back .0625, and the U.S. silver market fell .125, a reversal after several days of rising. The first order delivery remained unchanged, while the U.S. dollar decreased by .125. The internal market was calm, as the exchange rate did not move. The gold market opened lower by 2.4 qian, at 42.4 qian. This was due to a surprising surge in New York stock prices, and the forward silver price also rose, leading to fatigue in the market. Subsequently, buyers became active, with Guangbang and Hengxing Yuanlu and others strongly covering their short positions, reaching 45.5 qian at noon and closing at 4 liang. The afternoon opened at 4 liang, then remained very stable, fluctuating by only 7 qian. The closing price was 43.5 qian, down 1.3 qian from the previous day. The daily fluctuation was 5.5 qian at most and 1.5 qian at least, with a difference of 4 liang.</p>
<p>▲Friday: The London telegraph and silver prices remained unchanged. The first order delivery was fearfully set at .25, and the U.S. dollar rose .25, due to the sharp fall in exchange rates. The internal market also weakened. The gold market opened slightly higher by 3 qian, at 43.8 qian, then rose to 4 liang. Subsequently, selling pressure spread, falling to 40.09 qian. Later, the Central Bank absorbed cash, pushing the price to 42.6 qian. However, the selling position remained excessive, breaking through 40 taels at noon, reaching 39 taels, with a closing price of 9.4 qian. The afternoon opened at 7.8 qian, continuing the downward momentum from the noon closing. Then, Hengxing and others bought in, reaching 8.4 qian. However, the situation deteriorated on all sides, eventually falling to 35.6 qian (the lowest price since the swap), with a closing price of 36.5 qian, a sharp drop of 7 taels compared to the previous day. The daily fluctuation was 44 taels at most and 35.6 qian at least, with a difference of 8.4 qian.</p>
<p>▲Saturday: The London telegraph and silver prices both rose by .25. The first order delivery rose by .25, while the U.S. dollar only increased by .125, due to the sharp fall in exchange rates. Therefore, there was a divergence between the internal British and U.S. markets. The gold market initially opened at 37.2 taels, a rebound of 7 qian. Private telegraphs only increased by .0625. From 7.7 qian to 6.7 qian, the Dalian Gang was the first to sell off. Afterwards, buyers became active, and short positions were quickly covered. The exchange market improved, leading to an upward trend. It was rumored that the Central Bank was again absorbing cash, boosting market sentiment. The price moved forward and went past 40 taels. The closing price was 42.3 qian, up 5.8 qian from the previous day. The highest price was 42.4 qian, and the lowest was 36.7 qian, a difference of 5.7 qian. The high and low prices of the silver market and exchange rate benchmark prices are listed below.</p>

<p>The recent silver market was not very tight. Yesterday was a Sunday, a regular bank holiday, so the atmosphere was exceptionally quiet, and trading was also slow. Although the morning exchange rate rose by 7.5 hao, to 6 silver 8 fen 8 li, the afternoon exchange rate fell again by .25, to 6 qian 8 fen 7 li 7.5 hao. The amount of drafts and remittances made in the morning was 400,500, and in the afternoon, 280,000. There were no transactions in banknotes in either market. Since there were fewer transactions in silver dismantling, the market price did not move, remaining at 8 fen, the same in both morning and afternoon markets. Qianzhuang Yin's public bond settlements were over 22.2 million, foreign public bond settlements were over 4.22 million, and remittances from various routes were over 300,000. The buying and selling transactions of small qianzhuang were 36 qian .015 li in the morning and 6 qian .01 li in the afternoon. The transaction volume was 6,500 jiao in the morning and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver dollars were 5 qian 8 fen 3 li in the morning and 5 qian 8 fen 2.5 li in the afternoon. The transaction volume was 80,000 jiao in the morning and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins also rose by 500 wen, to 430,500 wen. The transaction volume was over 50,000 strings.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Securities The Bond Market Was Stable and Quiet Last Week <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲Increased by More Than One Yuan, with a Transaction Volume of 14 Million</p>
<p>During the past week (from August 1st to August 6th), the local Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange continued to operate two trading sessions in the morning. The market was deserted, and trading was extremely rare. Spot transactions totaled only 87,000 yuan for the entire week. Excluding the unified tax of 31,000 yuan, the salt tax of 21,000 yuan, and the 20 Customs Duty of 12,000 yuan, the remaining amount was only a few thousand yuan. There was no trading in the 19 Customs Duty, Charity 96, etc. Although the September futures had been open for bidding for several days, there were often no transactions. Therefore, almost the entire market was dominated by the August futures. The daily transaction volume was only a few hundred thousand yuan, totaling 14,458,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 4.6 million yuan compared to the previous week. This includes 3,055,000 yuan in salt tax, 2,100,000 yuan in disbandment bonds, 2,185,000 yuan in unified tax, 1,620,000 yuan in the 20 issue, 1,595,000 yuan in the 20 Customs Duty, 1,365,000 yuan in the 19 Customs Duty, 1,020,000 yuan in the 19 Charity, and others even less. For example, 815,000 yuan in the Disbandment Bond, 220,000 yuan in Customs Duty, 215,000 yuan in the Restructuring 6 li, 60,000 yuan in the 96 public bonds, and 20,000 yuan in financial bonds. Among these, the September futures for various bonds totaled only 65,000 yuan. As for the changes, the market had fallen sharply in the previous week. Although there were absolutely no turnaround signs in the market last week, it was generally stable. Retail investors bought in at lower prices, and prices rebounded consistently. From Monday to Thursday, prices fluctuated upward every day. However, on the weekend, buying decreased again, and prices weakened again. The entire process of change was very peaceful. Major investors remained on the sidelines, and the market only saw sporadic trading. As a result, compared to the previous week, except for a few spot prices that still fell, other prices rebounded by .56 jiao to 1.5 yuan. In the current market environment, large increases or decreases in the bond market seem unlikely. Therefore, unless there are major changes in the political situation or diplomacy, or significant improvements in the financial situation, the bond market will temporarily be stagnant and difficult to experience large fluctuations. The market may become even quieter. The high, low, and fluctuation of the prices of various bonds last week are listed in the following table (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e111">Yarn Market Standard Yarn Fell at the Beginning of the Week, Rebounded at the End <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Only 3,942 Bales of Current Yarn Were Sold to Customers</p>
<p>At the beginning of the past week, cotton yarn experienced a period of quiet after a large demand from various groups in the southern ports. Generally, it was believed that the current yarn market was sluggish, the war clouds in the Northeast were spreading, and the Tianjin factory yarn was affected by Japanese yarn, leading to blocked sales channels. There were rampant rumors of selling yarn in Shanghai. Sellers actively sold off, and the market price showed a downward trend. However, the Rongxing buyers realized that the factories had depleted their inventories. After selling all the yarn from the factories, the financial situation became much looser. The factories had a positive attitude, and the Yangtze River basin was expected to have a good harvest this year, leading to a strong desire to go long. Therefore, despite a large number of sales, they were absorbed by buyers. Both long and short positions had considerable strength. At the weekend, rumors of 1,500 bales of Tianjin yarn, and all the Hwasing factory's engineering branch yarn were bought by Sichuan buyers. At the same time, the market situation of American cotton and certain foreign yarn was firm, and market sentiment was shaken again, leading to a rise in the market. On the whole, cotton yarn may have a stabilizing possibility. Customer purchases during this week totaled only 3,492 bales, and the market was softening. Sichuan buyers purchased more than 2,000 bales, the most of any group. Others were very small. The standard yarn fell by 2-3 liang at the beginning of the week, and rebounded by more than 2 liang at the end of the week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 153,950 bales. The prices for each month fell by 4 qian compared to the previous week. The purchase volume of each group is listed below:</p>

<p>Cotton Mills' Demand Fairly Good</p>
<p>The cotton market has been mixed this past week. With U.S. cotton gradually rising and gold prices difficult to fall, the market has shown a soft yet firm trend. At the beginning of the week, due to the announcement of a large inventory of U.S. cotton, with a rollover of 11.449 million bales, market sentiment turned weak, and a selling frenzy suddenly emerged in the market, causing prices to plummet by 8-9 qian. Before long, prices rebounded, as the strong financial power on Wall Street caused stocks to soar, pulling up commodity prices. U.S. cotton prices rose, and domestic cotton prices followed suit due to the severe drought, which hampered the growth of new cotton. Prices rose by 7 qian in two days. The total transaction volume of standard cotton for the entire week was 252,800 dan. Prices for each month fell by 1.5 qian compared to the previous week. U.S. cotton was better by 30 pounds compared to the previous week. The future of the cotton market will depend on the progress of the U.S. and Indian cotton markets. As for actual demand, it is still good. The amount purchased by each factory through brokers is listed below:</p>
<p>Cotton Type Highest Price Lowest Price Transaction Volume Term</p>
<p>Huoji Brand 29.50 200 bales Spot, delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Zuorong Brand 27.25 140 pieces Spot, delivered to the factory</p>

<h3 id="e115">Wang Jingwei's Resignation Is Firm <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong Came to Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Persuade Him, But Did Not Get to See Him</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and, on the afternoon of that day at 4:00 PM, telegraphed five letters of resignation and moved to a new residence in western Shanghai, refusing to see guests. Details of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Ministers of Various Yuan Jointly Persuade Him to Stay After receiving Wang's resignation telegram at 4:30 PM the day before yesterday in Nanjing, the ministers of the central government's various Yuan immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to send Minister of Interior Huang Shaoxiong, together with Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, to Shanghai to persuade him to stay on behalf of the central government. Meanwhile, the ministers of the central government's various Yuan remaining in Nanjing jointly sent a letter to Wang. The content of the letter requested that Wang make an effort to overcome difficulties in this time of national crisis, and stated that if there were changes in the central government at this critical juncture, the overall situation would be worrying. They requested that he withdraw his resignation and return to Nanjing immediately to face the national crisis together. The letter was signed by Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan; Shao Yuanchong, President of the Legislative Yuan; Huang Shaoxiong, Minister of Interior and concurrently Minister of Communications; Luo Wengan, Minister of Foreign Affairs and concurrently Minister of Judicial Administration; Gu Mengyu, Minister of Railways, and others. That evening, a special envoy was dispatched to send the original letter to Shanghai, requesting that Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, and Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Education, who were in Shanghai, add their signatures. Finally, it was sent to Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance, for him to add his signature, and was sent to Wang's residence on Rue de la Poste at around 10:00 AM yesterday, and then forwarded to Wang.</p>
<p>▲Huang Shaoxiong Came to Shanghai to Persuade Wang Huang Shaoxiong, Minister of Interior and concurrently Minister of Communications, flew to Shanghai the day before yesterday under orders to persuade Wang to stay. Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways and Wang's confidant, also came to Shanghai. The two took a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Nanjing at 4:30 PM and arrived at Longhua Airport at around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. Huang resided at Room 217 of the Cangzhou Hotel, while Zeng Zhongming visited Wang. Wang had originally scheduled to meet Huang at his residence at 8:00 AM yesterday, but when Huang visited, Wang had not yet returned to his residence, so they did not meet. According to Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, who spoke to the Hua Dong News Agency reporter yesterday afternoon, Minister Huang did not have the opportunity to meet Mr. Wang today. If there is an opportunity this afternoon or tomorrow morning, they should be able to discuss everything in person. Minister Huang's visit is solely to persuade Mr. Wang to stay, and there are no other tasks, he said.</p>
<p>▲Zeng Visited Song Yesterday Evening and Returned to Nanjing Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming visited Wang the night before last after flying from Nanjing to Shanghai. At 8:10 AM yesterday, Zeng, on Wang's orders, went to Song's residence on Qiqi Road to meet with Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance. After talking for only five minutes, he hurriedly left. When Zeng left Song's residence, he told the Hua Dong News Agency reporter that the purpose of his visit to Song was to explain Wang's reasons for resigning and to ask Song to return to Nanjing immediately and, in his position as Vice President, concurrently take over the duties of President, so that the central government's affairs would not be suspended as a result. However, Song's attitude was still very humble, and there was no definite date for his return to Nanjing, he said. Zeng went to Nanjing last night.</p>
<p>▲Zeng Talks About the Reasons for Wang's Resignation A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met Zeng Zhongming at Wang's residence at 10:45 AM yesterday. According to him, Mr. Wang's resignation this time is due to his deep disapproval of Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, using the name of resistance to gather money. Now that Wang is the President of the Executive Yuan, he could have ordered his dismissal, but for the sake of the overall situation, after repeated consideration, he had no choice but to resign to take responsibility, and at the same time urge Zhang to realize his mistake. It is a proactive resignation, not a passive one. If the central government approves his resignation, then Mr. Wang is willing to take on party affairs work and can return to Nanjing within days. I visited Minister Song today purely to report the important reasons for President Wang's resignation. Minister of Interior and concurrently Minister of Communications Huang Shaoxiong has arrived in Shanghai, but has not yet met with Wang. He will probably meet Wang this afternoon. Huang is here to represent the central government in persuading Wang to return to Nanjing, but Wang's attitude towards resigning is firm, and there is no question of persuading him to stay. Wang's departure or stay is entirely for the public good, and not for ordinary reasons. As for the rumors that Wang telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to resign together and apologize to the people of the country, containing a sense of revenge, it is really not worth the laughter of knowledgeable people. In fact, there is no personal prejudice. The various departments have not yet made any indication, he said.</p>
<p>▲Wang Will Not Go Anywhere Else in Shanghai After submitting his resignation to the central government, Wang moved to a new residence on Rue Jules Joffre in western Shanghai, closed his door and rested quietly, refusing to see all guests. As for Wang's slight illness, he has fully recovered. According to Tang Youren, who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, all kinds of rumors such as Wang leaving Shanghai to go elsewhere are untrue. Wang is currently staying in Shanghai to recuperate and will not go anywhere else. If the National Government approves Wang's resignation, he will return to Nanjing immediately to continue serving the party and the country, he said.</p>
<p>▲Minister of Finance Song Temporarily Suspends Going to Nanjing According to the Central News Agency, after learning of Wang's resignation and receiving a telegram from Nanjing urging him to go to Nanjing immediately to act as President of the Executive Yuan, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen decided the night before last to take a plane back to Nanjing at 6:00 AM yesterday. The plane that Song took to Shanghai the day before last was already prepared for departure at Hongqiao Airport. It was temporarily suspended due to some matter. The Central News Agency reporter met Song at the office of Zhang Shouyong, an advisor to the Ministry of Finance, yesterday. According to him, regarding the issue of President Wang's resignation, I have expressed my hope that Wang will still make an effort to take on the difficult task. As for the date of return to Nanjing, it is undecided, he said. It is also learned that Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, and Vice President of the Academia Sinica Yang Xingfo visited Song at around 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of persuading President Wang to withdraw his resignation. According to Mayor Wu, there have been considerable results. Minister Song visited Zhang Shouyong at around 5:00 PM yesterday to discuss financial issues, and left after about fifteen minutes. According to Zhang, when sending Song to board the car, Song's visit was of a friendly nature, and the financial issues of the government were also mentioned. Although I have resigned from the position of Vice Minister of Finance, I will still assist Song in everything out of friendship, he said. It was also reported that Minister of Finance Song Ziwen sent a letter to President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei yesterday morning, requesting a scheduled date to discuss everything. In the afternoon, Wang replied and Zeng Zhongming took it to Song's residence. According to Zeng, President Wang's resignation is very firm, but it is definitely not passive. Minister of Interior Huang Shaoxiong has not yet met with Minister Song after arriving in Shanghai. They are scheduled to visit each other tomorrow (today), he said.</p>
<p>▲Wang's Wife, Chen Bijun, Arrives in Shanghai According to Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Conference, who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, Wang's wife, Chen Bijun, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Jiujiang Lushan on a China National Aviation Corporation plane. After arriving in Shanghai, Wang's wife returned to her private residence on Rue de la Poste. After learning that Wang had moved to a new residence, she immediately took a car to the new residence to express her condolences.</p>
<p>▲Telegrams of Condolences and Persuasion Arrive From Various Places Wang's residence in Shanghai received eighteen telegrams of condolences and persuasion yesterday from Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission and various ministries and commissions in Nanjing. Kong Xiangxi, special envoy to Europe to investigate industry, and Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua also sent lengthy letters to Wang to comfort and persuade him yesterday. The General Federation of Shanghai North Business Circles in this city sent representatives Xing Min, Qiu Liangyu, and Cao Youguang to visit Wang yesterday with a letter. Because Wang was not at his residence, the secretary met them on his behalf. The original letter stated, "President Jingwei, greetings. According to reports, your Excellency suddenly has the intention of retiring. We, the humble people, are shocked and terrified. At this time of national crisis, we rely on unity from top to bottom to resist foreign aggression together. Your Excellency leads from the front, and the people can follow from behind. If there are illegal soldiers who dare to coerce, then not only will the cessation of civil war be implemented, but the people will also pledge to be a backing. Our association represents all the people in Shanghai North, earnestly pleading to stay on, do not give rise to the idea of retreat, and please make an effort to overcome difficulties, strive to fight, firmly adhere to the original intention, and comfort the expectations of the people. Furthermore, our association plans to take advantage of your Excellency's visit to Shanghai, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, to request an inspection of the disaster area, so as to know the suffering of the locality. Therefore, we have appointed Qiu Liangyu, Xing Min, and Cao Youguang to visit Your Excellency. We respectfully hope that you will deign to grant an audience, present our suffering, and provide assistance. On behalf of the disaster victims of Shanghai North, we thank you deeply. We respectfully wish you good health. Respectfully, The General Federation of Shanghai North Business Circles." Furthermore, the General Labor Union of this city sent a letter to Wang Jingwei yesterday, saying, "Greetings to Mr. Jingwei. Yesterday, we read in the newspaper that, because the central government's finances are exhausted and difficult to maintain, and recently due to the Rehe incident, you feel more and more difficult, you suddenly resigned from the position of President of the Executive Yuan. After hearing this, we are inexplicably horrified. Since you took on the difficult task of presiding over the central government, you have worked diligently day and night and achieved great results. Now that the strong enemy is approaching and the Red Terror is rampant, internal and external troubles are intertwined, the people of the country are looking forward to you breaking through the difficulties, stabilizing the foundation of the country, and rescuing the people from water and fire. Unexpectedly, you suddenly announced your retirement, causing the central government to be without a responsible person, and the overall situation is becoming more and more chaotic. Thinking of the future, we cannot help but shudder. After repeated consideration, our association can only plead with you to prioritize national affairs, withdraw your resignation, return to Nanjing to resume your post, continue your efforts with perseverance and determination, and comfort the people's eager expectations. We earnestly state our words and hope that you will consider and accept them."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Industry and Commerce Respond to Wang's Telegram <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲Criticize Zhang Xueliang One After Another</p>
<p>▲The National General Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram to the Public The National General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, yesterday, asking him to rise up and resist to recover the lost territories of the Northeast. The original telegram stated, "Greetings to Director Zhang Hanqing of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters. We read in today's newspaper that President Wang sent your Excellency a telegram. We imagine that your Excellency will either advance to kill the enemy or retreat and give way to the worthy, and will have made a decision early. It is not necessary to repeat ourselves. However, what is called China is the China of the Chinese people. Sitting and watching the strong enemy invade without resisting, and being unable to recover the lost territories, the people of the country cry bitterly, and there is something that cannot be stopped in words. Since the Japanese bandits attacked Shenyang on September 18 last year, your Excellency was living leisurely in Peiping and Tianjin, and lightly ordered the front-line generals not to resist, and led the troops of the country to defend the territory without fighting and retreat. This is mistake number one. Since the fall of Shenyang, the enemy's power has become more rampant. Ma Zhanshan and others rose up to raise troops in Heihe, vowing to fight Japan to the death. At that time, if your Excellency led troops to advance together, attacking from both east and west, it would not be difficult to drive back the strong enemy in one go. Your Excellency did not plan this, and sat and watched the enemy take Jilin and Heilongjiang in the east and invade Jinzhou and Yu in the west, occupying Manchuria and forming a puppet state, thus starting the intention to attack Shanghai. This is mistake number two. The Nineteenth Route Army and the Fifth Route Army fought against the Japanese bandits in Shanghai for thirty-four days. The Japanese bandits repeatedly mobilized large armies and attacked with all their strength. At that time, if your Excellency hurriedly led troops to drive out the enemy from the pass, making it impossible for the enemy to take care of both ends, the enemy would surely be defeated on both routes. It would not only recover the lost territories of the Northeast, but also the anti-Japanese troops in Shanghai would not have been oppressed and retreated due to the enemy's leisurely reinforcements. Your Excellency still did not plan this. This is mistake number three. After the Battle of Shanghai, the agreement was signed, and the Northeast Volunteer Army rose up to kill the enemy. With untrained volunteer soldiers, knowing that they were no match, but driven by patriotism, everyone died, attacking Jinzhou and Liaoning in the morning, and attacking Shenyang and Yingkou at night, fighting to the death with the strong enemy. At that time, if your Excellency advanced and led them, and used the large army as a backing, the strong enemy, no matter how strong, would still not be enough to drive out. But your Excellency has paid no attention to it, like the people of Qin watching Yue. This is mistake number four. Now, in order to cover up the puppet state's plan, the enemy is advancing to Rehe and peeping at Peiping and Tianjin. The central government has repeatedly ordered resistance, and cannot lose another inch of land. But your Excellency has not sent troops, but first asked for huge sums of money. Our association does not dare to hastily say that your Excellency is using the name of resistance to gather money, knowing that the central government's finances are exhausted, and deliberately making things difficult. We cannot help but suspect that you are using it as an excuse to demand money. Now the enemy is deep, and the matter is urgent. We do not have time to interrogate the past. For the sake of the country and for your own sake, your Excellency should quickly reorganize the army, consolidate the defenses of Rehe, and recover the Northeast to redeem your previous sins. If you cannot, then please resign according to President Wang's telegram to apologize to the people of the country. Otherwise, you will miss the opportunity for military action. The national law may be able to forgive your Excellency, but the people of the country cannot forgive your Excellency. The difference between a sage and a thief is in one thought. What to do and where to go, only your Excellency can choose. The national crisis is pressing, and the words are not taboo. We humbly await your orders. Respectfully, The National General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>▲Various Labor Unions Send Telegrams to Yu The Shanghai Publishing Industry Labor Union Organizing Committee and other groups jointly telegraphed the central government yesterday, saying, "Most urgent, greetings to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government in Nanjing. Upon reading President Wang's telegram, we learned that Zhang Xueliang has consistently adhered to the policy of non-resistance, and is unwilling to send troops to resist Japan. Instead, he is using economic issues to blackmail the central government, so he resigned in anger to apologize to Zhang alone, and also asked Zhang to resign to apologize to the 400 million people of the country. President Wang's words are impassioned and tragic, deeply winning the hearts of our people. Zhang Xueliang, entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the government and enjoying the superior support of the people, held the important position of the Northeast border defense commander, but he actually adhered to the policy of non-resistance, allowing Shenyang and other important towns to be occupied by the Japanese. When defending Jinzhou, the matter could still be planned but was not done. Without firing a single bullet, he retreated entirely into the pass. Now that the violent sun is invading Rehe and peeping at Peiping and Tianjin, Zhang Xueliang is still numb as before, making no preparations at all, and is using the name of raising funds to blackmail the central government, still leisurely thinking that he is pleased with himself. This kind of military man who has lost territory and humiliated the country should have been executed, how can we let him leisurely enjoy himself, let him take his course, losing control of one person and ruining the survival of the country and nation? Now that the fire is burning our eyebrows, how can we discuss it in advance? We urge the central government to immediately issue a resolute order to dismiss Zhang Xueliang from his post and investigate him, and to immediately order the Military Affairs Commission to mobilize the entire country, quickly send troops to the Northeast, recover the lost territories, and implement President Wang's anti-Japanese proposal. Then our people of the entire country will surely be the backing of the government. We await your order with the utmost urgency. The Shanghai Publishing Industry Labor Union Organizing Committee, Seamen's Union, Dockworkers' Union, Shanghai East District Yarn Factory Federation, etc."</p>
<p>▲The Transportation Industry Association and Others Issue a Declaration The Shanghai Transportation and Customs Declaration Association, the Commercial Gang Association, and other public groups issued a declaration yesterday, saying, "Since the Shenyang Incident, those in our country who have huge armies have adhered to the policy of non-resistance, sitting idly by and watching the Northeast be lost without regret. And the general merchants in the country do not hesitate to turn the sweat and blood money of the people into a tool for the enemy to increase its aggression. Our people cannot bear the loss of the country, and are fighting to defend themselves. They are gathering compatriots and organizing the Northeast Volunteer Army and the Blood Soul Anti-Treason Corps, trying to save the situation at the last minute. One is not afraid of the heat and is willing to engage in hand-to-hand combat, and the other does not follow selfish views and vows to eliminate traitors who aid the enemy. Their patriotism is stirred up, and they have a heart full of</p>

<p>hot blood, as reported, the French police chief has expressed forgiveness towards Yun Huifang. Yun is an underage child, and her patriotism is so passionate. Our country's officials, there is no shortage of patriots, for the French police chief's expression, should also be touched by this. We hereby declare, we hope you will pay attention."</p>
<h3 id="e117">Temporary Martial Law Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>▲The Night Remained Peaceful as Usual</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Concession Police Department received secret reports a few days ago that the communists would take action on August 7 (yesterday). After receiving the report, the two authorities announced martial law in various places yesterday, stepping up precautions to avoid unexpected events. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲North Railway Station The Municipal Public Security Bureau received a report a few days ago that hundreds of communists would gather at the North Railway Station on the morning of August 7 to hold a meeting, and would have various unruly actions, attempting to disturb local public security. After receiving the report, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately ordered increased precautions. From 8:00 AM yesterday, the Fifth District General Office dispatched a full class of secret agents to station themselves around the North Railway Station to provide tight security. The security team also dispatched a security police squad and a red security vehicle to be stationed at the North Station, responsible for security. He Yiming, the district chief of the Fifth District, and Huang Ming, the director of the security regiment, also went to the station to supervise and inspect. At the same time, the Concession Police Department also dispatched a large number of detectives to station themselves along the boundary road, providing strict security. At the corner of North Henan Road, a security vehicle was parked in advance, paying close attention to pedestrians. However, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, nothing happened. In the afternoon, the detectives were withdrawn and replaced by a large police team to patrol back and forth.</p>
<p>▲Yangshupu The Concession Police Department received a secret report a few days ago that on the morning of August 7, the communists would take advantage of the Sunday holiday to promote the Rehe Incident and the anti-Japanese movement to workers in various factories in Yangshupu, attempting to incite strikes, marches, and demonstrations. The Yangshupu Police Department dispatched more than a hundred Chinese and Western detectives to various districts from 8:00 AM yesterday to provide strict security to prevent any unexpected gatherings. All gatherings were prohibited. In places such as Pingliang Road, Yulin Road, Liaoyang Road, and Lan Road, there were large numbers of detectives stationed, paying particular attention to those who looked like workers. From morning to dusk, security was maintained throughout, so fortunately no unexpected incidents occurred.</p>
<p>▲French Concession The French Municipal Police Department specially dispatched many detectives yesterday morning (the 7th), all armed, to guard the bridges in the area of Zhaojiabang and Xujiahui, providing temporary security, and closed the iron gates in various places, providing strict precautions. However, no accidents occurred until the evening, so the detectives were withdrawn and the original state was restored.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Various Industries Resist Enemy Goods Movement <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲Rubber, Hardware, and Vehicle Parts Industry The Rubber, Hardware, and Vehicle Parts Industry Association established an inspection team after the September 18th Incident. It has notified its members to seal up Japanese goods and stop selling them. Recently, it received a warning letter from the Blood Soul Anti-Treason Corps. It specially convened a general meeting of all members at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss thorough measures. More than twenty members attended. At the meeting, member Cao Shuntai reported that he had also received a similar letter, but his company did not buy or sell Japanese goods and should strictly abide by the rules. After discussion, a vote was taken to reiterate the notice that all members must not buy or sell Japanese goods, and an investigation team was organized to conduct strict inspections. If there are any who disobey, they will be severely punished. The meeting was adjourned after discussing important cases.</p>
<p>▲Pearl and Jade Industry The Public Association stated, "The Shanghai Pearl and Jade Industry Association hereby notifies all circles to resist inferior goods. The reason is that our association received a letter from the Anti-Treason Corps on August 1, regarding the minority of traitors in our industry who privately operated enemy goods, warning our association to quickly impose sanctions, otherwise the elimination of traitors would be skillful, and jade and stone would be burned together. Our association approved the letter. Earlier, our entire industry agreed that enemy goods were of inferior quality and prohibited sales, and had long established penalties to prevent the source. Since the January 28th Incident, all those in the industry with a little personality have warned each other, so counterfeit goods have disappeared from the market. However, recently, there have been a few degenerates who only seek profit and do not hesitate to do business with the enemy, using counterfeits to deceive the public, which is extremely hateful. After discussion, it was decided that from today, in addition to all executive committee members reporting at any time, we will also appoint ten impartial members of the industry to secretly monitor and investigate, so that traitors will be hidden and counterfeit goods will disappear, in order to maintain the reputation of the entire industry. However, these traitors have hundreds of tricks, and they may deceive customers to gain profit. We hereby respectfully inform all circles that if anyone sells counterfeit pearls (i.e., Dong goods seeds pearls, also known as natural pearls, which are large and small, round and flat, similar in shape and color to Shinkwang Shinju, extremely difficult to identify), counterfeit jade ornaments, please detain the goods and send them to our association for punishment according to law. We would be grateful. This is a notice."</p>
<p>▲Restaurant Industry The Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association sent a letter to its members, saying, "For urgent notification. Since the violent sun has invaded and advanced step by step, all Chinese people must do their best to fulfill their responsibilities. The raw materials used by our industry used to be counterfeit. Since the Northeast Incident, there have been anti-Japanese boycotts. The words were earnest, but they were not heard. There are many who obey the order to refuse to use enemy goods, but there are also those who are waiting and watching, and who are blinded by profit. (Omitted) Our association originally had a Japanese goods inspection organization committee, which was established. On July 30, the executive committee decided to hand it over to this committee to handle and perform its duties. If there are any colleagues who disobey, they will be deemed to be guilty, and the committee members will perform their duties in accordance with the rules. They will be handled separately from today. Do not say that we did not warn you in advance. This is a special urgent notice. I hope you will check and do not violate it."</p>
<h3 id="e119">Shanghai Industry and Commerce Inspection Group Wang Xiaolai and Others Return From Weihai Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲Pan Gongzhan and Others Still Stay in Jinan</p>
<p>The Qingdao industry and commerce inspection group organized by the business community of this city went to Qingdao and Weihaiwei to inspect industry and commerce. Now, the group of Wang Xiaolai and others, except for Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, and others who are still staying in Jinan, and will probably return to Shanghai within a few days, the rest have returned to Shanghai by ship from Weihai yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Personnel Arriving in Shanghai Those who arrived in Shanghai yesterday included Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Chen Zheqing, Hu Renzhi, and Li Zushen. They took the Taikoo Da Ming ship from Weihaiwei on the evening of the 5th of this month and returned to Shanghai. At 4:00 PM yesterday, they arrived at the Pudong Pier and then changed to a small ship and landed at the Taikoo Pier. Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Liu Yunfang, etc., after going to Qingdao, went to Jinan to inspect and will also return to Shanghai within a few days.</p>
<p>▲Journey of the Industry and Commerce Inspection Group The Shanghai industry and commerce inspection group departed from Shanghai on the 26th of last month and first went to Qingdao, where they were hosted by Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, and inspected the local industry, commerce, and municipal construction, rural conditions, etc. On the 3rd of this month, Mayor Shen ordered the Zhaoyuan warship to carry Wang and others to Weihaiwei, where they were guided by Xu Zushan, the management commissioner of the area, to visit various places. After two days, on the night of the 5th, they took the Da Ming ship back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Wang's Speech A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Wang Xiaolai at his private residence last night. According to him, both Qingdao and Weihaiwei are newly recovered areas of our country. Weihaiwei has only been recovered for two years, but the local undertakings are doing very well. Qingdao's municipal construction and rural economy are managed using scientific methods. Industry and commerce are also thriving. Several places are limited by economy, so they cannot develop fully. As for the honesty of the folk customs, it is unmatched by other places. There have been no lawsuits involving the public for many years, and thieves have disappeared. Weihaiwei is also very successful, which is very suitable for small businesses, so those who are interested in doing business can invest there and do not have to be obsessed with Shanghai. Wang also plans to publish a discussion on the relationship between Qingdao and Weihaiwei and industry and commerce within days.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Cotton Yarn Tax Rate Issues <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Tracing back, our nation was founded on agriculture, with silk and hemp being major elements. Since the rise of the textile industry, cotton planting and mechanical weaving have become important real industries. However, up to today, they still cannot be fully developed. Is it not due to poor human planning, but also the nation's failure to fully promote them? Cotton planting belongs to agriculture, and textile manufacturing belongs to machinery. Both are specialized technologies. Today's advocates of new agricultural science and engineers proficient in textiles are constantly striving for excellence. However, the smooth flow of goods is crucial, especially concerning taxation. Now, at a time when we are initiating the promotion of domestic goods, society is paying closer attention to the textile industry. This newspaper has specifically interviewed a certain gentleman in the textile industry, first discussing the issue of tariffs, so that the world knows the urgent need to promote domestic goods. Moreover, promoting domestic goods especially depends on the nation establishing protective policies as a pioneer. The following is the gentleman's statement:</p>
<p>China's textile industry began in the late Qing Dynasty, initiated by Li Wenzhong. The China Merchants Textile New Bureau was his first creation, which is today's Shanghai Hengfeng Yarn Factory. At that time, the nation advocated mechanical manufacturing, and the tariffs on machine-made foreign goods were specifically lower than other types of goods, to resist imported products. The export tax on cotton yarn was 7 mace (關平七錢) per dan (担), equivalent to 8 mace (銀八錢) based on the current 98 standard silver dollar (規元). Each dan is 320 catties (斤), so the tax was 2 taels (關平二兩) and 2.4 mace (二錢四分), equivalent to 2 taels (規元二兩) and 5.6 mace (五錢六分) in standard silver dollars. This has been in place for over twenty years without increase. However, after the European War, the Washington Conference passed the addition of surtaxes for China. The original intention of adding surtaxes was to increase import taxes, so that domestic industries could gain more protection, and not to add them to domestic products. However, at that time, in 1923, Sun Chuanfang governed Jiangsu, and the increased tariffs were also applied to domestic goods. Thus, the original cotton yarn tax of 2 taels (二兩) and 5.6 mace (五錢六分) per bale was increased to 3 taels (三兩) and 8.4 mace (八錢四分).</p>
<p>In 1927, the National Government was established, with many military expenditures and insufficient national funds. By 1930, there were renewed discussions about increasing the yarn tax. However, due to the large number of Japanese-owned yarn factories in the country, implementing the tax increase required prior negotiation with them. Therefore, people were sent to negotiate, proposing 6 yuan (元) per dan, equivalent to 18 yuan (元) per bale. From June to November, there were back-and-forth rejections. At that time, Chinese-owned yarn factories, upon hearing the news, also rose up in opposition and presented the advantages and disadvantages to the Legislative Yuan. As a result, a special tax was implemented (now merged into the consolidated tax). For coarse yarn of 23 counts and below, the tax was 2 taels (挩銀二元) and 7.5 mace (七角五分) per dan, equivalent to 8 yuan (八元) and 5.8 mace (五角八分) or 6 taels (規元六兩) and 2.5 mace (二錢五分) in standard silver dollars per 320-catty bale. For fine yarn above 23 counts, the tax was 3 taels (稅銀三元) and 7.5 mace (七角五分) per dan, equivalent to 11 yuan (十一元) and 6.3 mace (六角三分) or 8 taels (規元八兩) and 3 mace (三錢) in standard silver dollars per bale. The increase was more than double.</p>
<p>Moreover, looking back before the implementation of the special tax, when the tariff increased from 2 taels (二兩) and 5.6 mace (五錢六分) to 3 taels (三兩) and 8.4 mace (八錢四分), the collected tax was a tariff. Sales within the province and nearby rural areas initially did not require tariffs, except for the reed mat fee of 1-2 yuan per bale. When the new system was implemented, it was called a consolidated tax, and all cotton yarn leaving the factory was taxed. Even sales within the province and nearby rural areas were subject to the same tax rate. Factories in the interior (such as Nantong and Wuxi), which previously sold part of their products nearby and did not bear this tax, now uniformly bear it, making business even more difficult to develop.</p>
<p>The raw material for cotton yarn manufacturing is cotton. The quality of cotton in our country is relatively inferior, so imported cotton must be used. The import tax on cotton has always been 1 tael (銀一兩) and 2 mace (二錢) per dan. Since the tariff began to be levied in gold units, the tax rate has risen to 3 taels (銀三兩). Each bale of cotton yarn requires more than 300 catties (斤) of cotton. Therefore, the factory's output of cotton yarn, in addition to paying a tax rate of 6 taels (六兩) and 2.5 mace (二錢五分) or 8 taels (八兩) and 3 mace (三錢) per bale, must also bear the import tax on more than 300 catties (斤) of raw materials, totaling 10 taels (十兩) and 7-8 mace (七八錢). This is something unheard of in other countries. Comparing it to the yarn tax in Japan, their domestic sales of yarn made from imported cotton, without exporting it, are taxed 17-18 taels (十七八兩) less per bale than our domestic factories, saving on tariffs and imported cotton. Moreover, their exports of finished yarn are also taxed 10 taels (十兩) and 7-8 mace (七八錢) less per bale for the imported cotton. As for Chinese-produced cotton, although not abundant or of the highest quality, it is still quite usable. However, the difficulty of procurement and local demands constantly make merchants hesitant. For example, in the Laohekou area of central Hubei two years ago, over 400,000 dan of fine cotton were produced, priced at only 20 yuan (元) per dan, which was not expensive. Merchants went to procure it, but the upstream area of Laohekou was the location of bandit troops, and the downstream route to Shashi was occupied by provincial troops. The merchants negotiated with the bandit troops, who demanded 4 yuan (元) per dan for passage. They negotiated with the provincial troops, whose headquarters demanded 6 yuan (元) per dan for escort. However, even after paying 6 yuan (元), the headquarters' orders still could not be enforced. The stationed troops demanded another 6 yuan (元) per dan to allow passage. The merchants had no choice but to pay. Thus, the cost of the purchased cotton, not including transportation, was burdened with 16 yuan (元) per dan, making it unbearable. No one dared to try again. Northern railways' transportation rights were mostly controlled by stationed troops, who would not transport goods without additional car fees. Japanese merchants buying cotton in Jinan, due to their special influence on the Jiaoji Railway, could transport goods at any time by paying only the standard freight fee, with no other demands. Therefore, Chinese factories were forced to buy domestic cotton from Japanese merchants, which is regrettable. As a result, farmers who plant cotton have almost no one to sell to, making them even more distressed. Considering imported cotton, in the most recent cotton accounting year, from July of the twelfth year of the Republic to June of this year, the total imports of American cotton were about 1 million bales, equivalent to more than 3.7 million dan, valued at over 110 million taels (兩) in standard silver dollars. This does not include Indian cotton, which is also a significant amount. Considering China as an agricultural country, and that cotton, a crucial agricultural product, depends so heavily on foreigners, with so much money flowing out, how can the nation sustain itself?</p>
<p>Regarding domestic cotton planting, since the Chinese Yarn Factory Association requested Southeast University to experiment with improved cotton seeds in the second year of the Republic, nearly twenty years have passed, and over 100,000 yuan (元) has been spent. However, the results have not been very common, due to two reasons. First, it is difficult to distribute high-quality seeds to various provinces and villages. Second, the most suitable provinces and villages for cotton planting are the northern provinces of Shanxi, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shandong. However, the farmers in those areas find the profits from planting opium far greater than from planting cotton. The sale of cotton is not always easy, and farmers do not have the ability to store it for long periods. Opium, on the other hand, can be sold immediately after harvesting, yielding higher profits.</p>
<p>Cotton production in the Northwest is also strong, with Xinjiang's cotton being especially good. However, due to inconvenient transportation and the time required for shipping, it cannot circulate smoothly within the country. Some factories in Tianjin and Shanghai have tried buying Xinjiang cotton, mostly in small packages of 14 pounds each, sent by post, with postage of over one yuan per package. Those who plan for the nation should truly understand that the land yields benefits.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese goods have been subject to boycotts, leading to sluggish sales of Japanese cotton. As a result, they compete by lowering prices. For every bale of Chinese yarn sold at 160 taels (兩), Japanese yarn sells for 140 taels (兩). When the price of Chinese yarn drops, the price of Japanese yarn drops accordingly, until Chinese yarn can no longer drop and can no longer be sold. This cannot be called dumping, but only disruption. The same is true for cotton cloth. For example, Chinese factory-made oil-dyed twill sells for 6 taels (六兩) and 2 mace (二錢) per bolt, while Japanese goods sell for 4 taels (四兩) and 8 mace (八錢). This is an extreme example of destructive capabilities, but it is still difficult for both sides to sell smoothly. However, due to economic and transportation factors, sales in the North have not decreased. As for the sales price related to the raw material cost, the average selling price of Chinese factory yarn is around 160 taels (兩) per bale, which is not high. However, due to the fluctuating market price, the difference is significant, reducing people's purchasing power and causing merchants to wait and see, resulting in sluggish sales. Therefore, it cannot be blamed on the high price of yarn. Around 160 taels (兩) is the lowest price in the past three years. Moreover, the raw material is imported foreign cotton, and the price of gold has more than doubled. Given these factors, the selling price is not exorbitant. Some say that the price of Chinese yarn has risen after the boycott of Japanese goods, but this is an overestimation.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Various Parties Rescue Yun Huifang <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲ Lawyer Zhao Chen: The case of Yun Huifang, who was arrested for throwing a bomb to warn treacherous merchants, was transferred from the Public Security Bureau to the French Concession Police Station at 11:30 AM the day before yesterday. Upon hearing this, her family entrusted criminal law expert Lawyer Zhao Chen to find a way to rescue her. Lawyer Zhao went to the French Concession administrative and judicial authorities for inquiries on the afternoon of the day before yesterday and learned that she was detained in the Political Department of the Songshan Road Police Station. Lawyer Zhao went to visit her. The police station treated Yun with courtesy. Lawyer Zhao explained the family's intention to rescue her. Yun spoke with fervor and excitement. Lawyer Zhao was moved by her patriotic enthusiasm and agreed to provide pro bono defense. It is also reported that the case will be transferred to the Second Special District Court for trial at 9:00 AM on the 8th.</p>
<p>▲ National Salvation United Association and Various Organizations: Regarding the arrest of patriotic youth Yun Huifang, the National Salvation United Association held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon. Chen Yaofu, Shen Zunu, Zhang Liubai, Chen Peide, Wu Zhongdao, Zhang Yichen, Song An, and others were appointed to go to the Municipal Public Security Bureau today to request the immediate release of patriotic youth Yun Huifang based on legal principles. The association also prepared an official letter, the original text of which is as follows: "Respectfully, Japan forcibly occupies the Eastern Provinces and endangers Shanghai, while our people rise up to resist and implement economic severance. This is a necessary action for our patriotic people. However, our treacherous merchants are greedy for profit and sell out the country, ignoring the public opinion. Taking severe measures to deal with such scoundrels in order to resist Japan is also a necessary legal right for our loyal people. In terms of sentiment and reason, we should request their immediate release. Furthermore, in terms of legal principles, our treacherous merchants aid the aggressor, and any of our people, according to popular will, deal with such traitors, which is allowed by national law and is naturally justified. Moreover, Yun Huifang is only sixteen years old and has not reached the legal age. How can she be arbitrarily arrested? After being arrested, she should be released according to the law to avoid harm. How can she be detained for so long, dispiriting the people? Therefore, representatives Chen Yaofu, Zhang Tianbai, Shen Zurui, Chen Peide, Zhang Xichen, Song An, Wu Zhongdao, etc., are sent to present everything and are willing to be responsible for bail. Please grant an audience. Respectfully, the Shanghai National Salvation United Association." The Shanghai National Salvation United Association held its sixth board meeting at its headquarters in Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, yesterday. Li Cishan of the Lawyers Association, Yin Zhiling of the National Disaster Relief Association, Tan Bozhi of the Youth Association Anti-Japanese Association, Yu Kang of the Student Self-Government Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association of various universities, Liu Shixiong of the National Lawyers Association, Chen Guoliang of the Rickshaw Drivers General Union, Lin Zhifu of the Chinese Academy of Arts and Sciences, Xiao Bingzhang of the Jiangxi Association, Zhao Zhenpeng of the Anti-Japanese Progressive Association, and more than thirty directors attended. Lin Zhifu chaired the meeting and discussed the following important matters: Regarding the organization of the National Goods Investigation Committee, it was resolved that the purpose is to promote domestic goods and boycott enemy goods. Committee members are limited to members of the association, and the committee will consist of nine to fifteen members. The detailed organization will be modified and handled by the standing directors. Regarding the arrest of Yun Huifang for patriotic enthusiasm, it was resolved that Yun Huifang, being under the age of sixteen and driven by patriotic enthusiasm, came forward to uphold justice and eliminate treacherous merchants. Her intention is commendable and her situation is forgivable. Moreover, there is legal justification. It was decided to send an official letter to the Public Security Bureau for bail and to request the National Lawyers Association to take charge of the matter. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, it is reported that a fifteen-year-old youth, Yun Huifang, used leftover bombs from her service in the volunteer army to warn the Maochang Foreign Goods Store on Minquan Road, which sells smuggled goods. Such actions may be debatable in law, but greatly justifiable in sentiment. All Chinese people hope for a fair and just resolution. From a legal perspective, since the youth was arrested by your bureau's Second District, according to the principle of jurisdiction based on the location of the offender, she should be handed over to the inland court for trial. However, your bureau allowed the French Concession police to transfer her, and now she has been transferred back. Furthermore, the Public Concession police have proposed another transfer. Such patriotic youth cannot be compared to thieves and adulterers. If there is a violation of the law, the inland court can easily punish her according to the law. Your bureau and the inland prosecutor are fully capable of handling the investigation and prosecution without the need for assistance from the Concession police. If the Concession police have any opinions, they can present them to the inland court without the need to overstep their authority. This matter concerns upholding legal rights, so we earnestly report it and request your consideration and execution. We would be most grateful. Respectfully, to Director Wen of the Shanghai Municipal Government Public Security Bureau, Shanghai National Salvation United Association, August 7th."</p>
<p>▲ The General Labor Union and the Dagon Society stated, "The city's General Labor Union issued a declaration regarding the case of patriotic martyr Yun Huifang, stating that the violent Japan has abandoned international trust and brazenly occupied the Northeast with force and invaded our Shanghai with heavy troops, which is extremely heinous. Our people, for the sake of self-defense and passive resistance, have launched a boycott movement, aiming to block their economy and resist their violent aggression. However, there are some treacherous merchants who have lost their conscience and dare to openly undermine the people's self-help movement. Therefore, youth with boiling blood are forced to rise up and carry out the work of expulsion. This is how the Blood Soul Corps came into being. Recently, Yun Huifang, a member of the corps, was arrested by the Public Security Bureau for throwing a bomb to warn treacherous merchants. Upon hearing this, we are filled with grief and indignation. In addition to sending personnel to find ways to rescue her, we hope that the city's compatriots will pay close attention to this case and unanimously and resolutely implement the self-help and self-defense boycott movement, fearing no sacrifice. Respectfully declared."</p>
<p>▲ The Changzhou Fellow-Villagers Association: When Changzhou natives in Shanghai, Wen Lanting, Wang Binyan, and others heard about the arrest of patriotic fellow-villager Yun Huifang, they held an emergency meeting at the Changzhou Fellow-Villagers Association on Tongfu Road at 5:00 PM yesterday. Wen Lanting (represented by Jiang Junyi), Wang Binyan, Liu Shaoyun, Liu Hongxun, Jiang Junyi, Wang Jian'e, Xie Liheng, Liu Wenzao, Tu Hesheng, Cao Xiqing, and dozens of others attended. Liu Shaoyun chaired the meeting and reported the purpose of the rescue. After discussion, three resolutions were made: (A) Solicit enthusiastic fellow-villagers to jointly sign and provide bail to the court when necessary. (B) Officially appoint Liu Shaoyun, Jiang Junyi, and Wang Jian'e as representatives of the association to take charge of the matter and have full authority to hire fellow-villager lawyers to carry out all matters. (C) Comfort the family. Then, other association affairs were discussed and a declaration was issued, stating, "Since the 19th Route Army, which bravely resisted the enemy, was ordered to enter Fujian to suppress bandits after the agreement was signed, forsaking the love of all the people of Suzhou, a group of insane and reckless treacherous merchants, ignoring the arduous struggle of the Northeast Volunteer Army and the call for the restoration of Shanghai, openly promote enemy goods, raise funds for the enemy abroad, and destroy the people's livelihood at home, with sinister intentions and unforgivable crimes. Such indirect acts of treason have received almost no attention. As a result, sighs and weeping sounds, and the vision of despair, fill the crowds and society of Shanghai. Therefore, youth with boiling enthusiasm, mourning the impending demise of the nation and the people, and receiving the guidance of sacrificing themselves for righteousness, step forward to uphold justice, which is the norm of reason. Then, is Yun Huifang's disregard for the law and sacrifice to save the country Yun Huifang's fault? It is the fault of the authorities for not resisting the enemy and the society for not punishing treacherous merchants. Therefore, although the members of our association do not know Yun Huifang, we admire Yun Huifang's patriotism and worship Yun Huifang's spirit, which is even greater than knowing her. From the standpoint of origin, we are ashamed to be her elders. Reasoning and discussing justice, our association should rise up to rescue Yun Huifang and should not lag behind others. Now, three methods have been discussed and resolved: First, solicit enthusiastic fellow-villagers to jointly sign and be responsible for providing bail to the court. Second, appoint responsible representatives and legal experts to study legal resistance. Third, send representatives to comfort her family. The above methods will be implemented without empty talk. We hope that our fellow-villagers in Shanghai, enthusiastic public groups, will jointly provide assistance. Respectfully declared, we hope for your public consideration."</p>
<h3 id="e122">Fire Insurance Compensation Issues During the Shanghai War <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tongtai Yong vs. Hequn Company</p>
<p>▲ Appeal Judgment: Tongtai Loses</p>
<p>▲ Danger Arising from Hostile Actions</p>
<p>▲ Not Within the Insurance Contract</p>
<p>After the cessation of the Sino-Japanese Shanghai War, among the lawsuits accepted by the First Special District Court, the outcome of two cases depended on this war. One is the dispute over the termination of the ship charter contract between Yuan'an Shipping Company and Shanghai Zhongwei Shipping Company, which is still under trial, because Zhongwei denied that the Shanghai War was a formal war and refused to terminate the contract, leading to the lawsuit. The outcome is still uncertain. The other is the case of Tongtai Yong, which was burned down by Japanese troops attacking Chinese troops on February 2nd. Its manager, Chen Lianghuai, wanted to force Hequn Business Company to compensate for the insured fire insurance money. Therefore, he deliberately made a statement against his conscience, saying that his store was not burned down due to military affairs. However, the store was located at 3263-3266 Seward Road, Hongkou, which was completely within the occupied area of the Japanese army. Therefore, at 5:00 AM on February 2nd, the store's employees had already fled. The building was shot by guns and cannons, causing a fire. Although the Chinese members of the Public Works Department fire brigade also drove to rescue it, they were not allowed by the Japanese army. All buildings and goods were burned to ashes, and the fire extinguished itself. The estimated loss reached 58,999 taels. The store had a total of 97,000 taels of fire insurance, of which 10,000 taels were insured by Hequn Business Company on behalf of the German company Selegi Yage Company. After being sued, Hequn hired Lawyer Shen Yuesheng to file a defense, exhaustively listing reasons why it should not be liable for compensation for the loss, especially emphasizing the provisions of Article 6 of the insurance contract. First Special Court Civil Division Judge Shen Hong repeatedly gathered evidence, summoned all witnesses, and held hearings, which have already concluded. The judgment was announced the day before yesterday, rejecting the plaintiff's lawsuit and the request for provisional execution, with the plaintiff bearing the litigation costs. The judgment has already been sent to the officers yesterday. If there is any dissatisfaction, an appeal may be filed with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court within 20 days after delivery. The reasoning in the judgment is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>In this case, the plaintiff claimed compensation from the defendant based on the insurance contract, while the defendant's defense can be divided into three points: (1) The plaintiff entered into the insurance contract with Selegi Yage Insurance Company, and the defendant is only an agent and is not liable according to the law. (2) Article 21 of the insurance contract states that the company's agent is not responsible for the company's litigation behavior or other investigative behavior, and the insured shall not seek to compensate for damages from the agent's own property. (3) The excluded risks in clause B of Article 6 of the insurance contract. The court found that the signatory on the insurance contract and the insurance receipt was the defendant Hequn Business Co., Ltd. Although there was also the imprinted German company Selegi Yage Insurance Company and the word "agent" in Western text under Hequn Business Co., Ltd., the envelope of the insurance contract given by the defendant to the plaintiff was labeled as the insurance department of Shanghai Hequn Business Co., Ltd., without the Chinese word "agent." It is inferred that the plaintiff at the time actually trusted Hequn Business Company as the insurer. The defendant cannot deny the inconsistency of the plaintiff's claim by claiming to be a nominal agent. Even if we concede a step, Selegi Yage Insurance Company is a foreign company and has not registered with our National Registration Bureau. According to Article 15 of the Implementation Law of the General Principles of the Civil Code, its actors should still bear joint and several liability. As for the section in Article 21 of the insurance contract, as mentioned above, its defense claim is also difficult to establish. However, clause B of Article 6 of the insurance contract states that dangers arising from acts of war, such as aggression and foreign hostile actions, are not within the scope of the insurance contract. Therefore, to resolve whether the defendant is liable for compensation, it is necessary to determine whether the above circumstances exist. According to the plaintiff's statement, the cause of the fire in the insured house was that the war was very dangerous at the time, there was no one in the store, and the details are not known now. Witness Pier Mulumutuchen stated that before Tongtai Yong caught fire, he heard gunshots at 4:00 AM and saw Japanese sailors below during the day. Witness Bolasi stated that when we went to put out the fire, we heard gunshots at the Wuchang Road intersection. Because there was danger ahead, the Japanese navy prevented us from moving forward, so we stopped. Witness Bai Ke stated that in February, Chinese people could not go to Hongkou Zhabei for insurance matters for various Chinese and foreign insurance companies, so foreigners went. I also went with a pass. Tongtai Yong's address was under the jurisdiction of the Japanese army. On February 2nd, I went to Tongtai Yong to inspect and saw a group of Japanese soldiers. I asked the Japanese officer how Tongtai Yong caught fire, and he said that at 5:00 AM, someone attacked them, and they retaliated. When the plaintiff's insured house was burned, that place was indeed occupied by the invading Japanese army, and there was danger arising from hostile actions, caused by foreign hostile actions. There is considerable evidence to prove this. According to clause B of Article 6 of the insurance contract, the plaintiff is unable to claim that the defendant is liable for compensation. Although the plaintiff submitted a reply letter from the headquarters of the 19th Route Army, stating that there was no organization of plainclothes teams during the military operations of our army, this can only prove that there was no plainclothes team at that time. That letter does not provide contrary evidence to the hostile actions of the Japanese army invading the area. Therefore, it cannot be used to overturn the above evidence. Furthermore, Hequn Business Co., Ltd. has been registered, and Miao Jinfathe and others are the company's executive directors. The defendant submitted the company's registration license, causing the plaintiff's agent to withdraw the lawsuit against Miao Jinfathe and others in court. However, it is inappropriate to subsequently declare in court that Miao and others are still the defendants. As for the request for a declaration of provisional execution, since the plaintiff's lawsuit cannot be considered justified, it should not be discussed. In conclusion, the plaintiff's lawsuit is unjustified. In accordance with Article 81 of the Civil Procedure Law, the judgment is rendered as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Youth Association Accounting Clerk Murdered <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲ Gong Yanru was Diligent in His Work</p>
<p>▲ A Trip to Ming Yuan From Which He Did Not Return</p>
<p>▲ The Location in the Huangpu River Where the Body Was Discovered</p>
<p>▲ The Death Appears to Have Been Caused by Robbery</p>
<p>Gong Yanru, the accounting clerk of the Shanghai Youth Association, went out for a stroll on the evening of the 4th of this month and suddenly disappeared. His body was found in the Huangpu River the day before yesterday (the 6th). After examination, it was discovered that there was a knife wound on the left side of his neck, leaving no doubt that he was murdered. However, how he was killed is still unclear. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Gong Jun's Background Gong Jun was a native of Yueyang, Hunan, 42 years old. He used to work in business circles in Tianjin and Hankou. Last summer, he took the position of accounting clerk at the Youth Association. He was diligent in his work and got along well with his colleagues. On the evening of the 4th of this month, at 8:00 PM, after having dinner at home, he went to Ming Yuan Amusement Park. When he left, his demeanor was as usual. He even told his children that he would buy some candy to bring back.</p>
<p>▲ A Trip to Ming Yuan From Which He Did Not Return That evening, his colleague Mr. Yang and old friend Mr. Zhang were also at Ming Yuan to escape the heat. They both met him and had a pleasant conversation. Unexpectedly, Gong Jun did not return home that night, and there was still no news the next day. His family was extremely anxious and asked people to look for him everywhere. They also reported it to the police and the water police bureau.</p>
<p>▲ Discovery of the Body On the 6th of this month, a body was found in the Huangpu River near Lujiazui. It was retrieved by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Lifesaving Bureau. His family went to identify it upon hearing the news. It was indeed Gong Jun's body. They immediately reported it to the Shanghai Local Court. Yesterday, the court sent a prosecutor to examine the body. It was discovered that there was a knife wound on the left side of his neck, confirming that he had been murdered. Lawyer Yao Xian, representing the family of the deceased, immediately claimed the body, prepared it for burial, and requested the court to strictly arrest the murderer and punish them according to the law.</p>
<p>▲ Speculation About the Murder According to the prosecutor's opinion, the knife wound did not appear to be fatal, and there was a lot of water in his abdomen, suggesting that he may not have been dead when he fell into the water. It is believed that he was stabbed and then pushed into the Huangpu River. According to his family, Gong Jun had more than 30 yuan in cash, a wristwatch, and a gold watch with him when he went out on the evening of the 4th. All of these are now missing. It is suspected that he was robbed and murdered by bandits. Gong Jun had a total of seven children, all of whom are dependent on him. This sudden misfortune is deeply regrettable.</p>

After interrogation by the chief of the military law office, the bandits Ding, etc. confessed without hesitation. Except for the bandit Ding Xibiao, whose crime was relatively minor and was sent to the court for trial separately, the two bandits Ding Xitian and Weng Desheng were sentenced to death in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Bandits. After being submitted to the provincial government for approval, they were executed by firing squad in Suzhou yesterday morning (the 7th).</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Attitude of Foreign Banks Amidst the Calls to Abolish the Taels and Implement the Yuan <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲ They Advocate Waiting for Ten or Twenty Years</p>
<p>▲ The Aim is to Preserve Control Over Financial Power</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance expressed its determination to implement the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan and established a committee to study the issue, chambers of commerce in various regions and industries in this city have expressed their support. However, they advocate that serious attention must be paid to the fineness of the new currency and the supervisory measures for issuing banknotes thereafter. However, Mr. Mukshot, the representative of foreign banks, has different views on the yuan reform. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, considering that the abolition of taels is related to the settlement of foreign trade and telegram prices, specifically investigated the news about this matter as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Attitude of Foreign Banks Mr. Mukshot, the representative of foreign banks, expressed his attitude to the Research Committee of the Ministry of Finance in writing, advocating that the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan should be implemented only after ten or twenty years. The reason is based on the average number of taels over the past ten years being 7 taels, 2 fen, 1 li, 7 hao, and 5 si. Therefore, he believes that the assumed weight of the new silver coin, which is 7 taels and 9 li, is too low. The mint must manufacture coins of the same weight and fineness as those currently circulating in the market. The government should bear the minting cost, which is approximately 1.5 million to 2.5 million yuan per month. The abolition of taels should be implemented after sufficient new silver coins have been prepared. In short, while not opposing it in principle, he actually advocates delaying it.</p>
<p>▲ Rebuttal by Chinese Committee Regarding the statement made by Mr. Mukshot, the representative of foreign banks, Chinese committee members such as Chen Xing and Bei Songsun refuted it at the research committee meeting. They argued that the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan is the best opportunity at this time when silver dollars are rampant and foreign exchange rates are plummeting. If we wait for ten or twenty years, market changes may make it impossible to implement. Moreover, if the new silver coins are of better fineness, the government's minting and private remelting will mean that the new coins will never be sufficient for use, and the abolition of taels will never be implemented. As for the cost of minting silver coins, it should be borne by the people, as is the case in Germany, France, and Japan. This is because the current situation of the government makes it impossible to bear this expense.</p>
<p>▲ The Proposal From Ten Years Ago Mr. G.H. Stitt, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the former Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, delivered a speech on the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan at a meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai in 1920. He briefly stated that the foreign chambers of commerce resolved at a meeting in Shanghai in 1919 to request the Chinese government to abolish silver taels and unify the silver subsidiary coins and copper coins of the whole country. They also proposed establishing a mint in Shanghai to freely mint silver coins so as to effectively manage the mint and maintain a single standard system. It is heard that the Chinese government has formally accepted the proposal, and the authorities are inclined to accept it. Two years ago, the foreign banks exchanged views with the financial authorities. The banks mostly acknowledged that the abolition of silver taels and the unification of silver coins would be very beneficial. Although the banking industry currently benefits considerably from the exchange of silver taels and the conversion between taels and yuan, it is believed that the unification of silver coins will have a very good impact on commerce. Although the benefits of silver taels will be lost at that time, the gains will outweigh the losses. However, the unification of silver coins must be extremely strict so that its fineness and weight are consistent throughout the country and the same as the currencies of European and American countries. Then the new system will be able to be promoted without hindrance. From this, it can be seen that the foreign banks at that time also very much hoped that the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan could be implemented.</p>
<p>▲ The Key to Advocating Delay The foreign banks already suggested to the Chinese government to abolish taels and adopt the yuan twelve years ago. Now that the government is determined to implement it, they say that it should be waited for ten or twenty years. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency specifically asked someone who is very familiar with the financial situation yesterday about the reasons for the foreign banks' advocacy of delay. According to the discussion, this abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan is intended to unify the monetary system internally and recover financial sovereignty externally. Because Shanghai's market now uses silver taels as the unit of account, (1) large-scale imports are currency, and the power over supply and demand is controlled by foreigners. After the abolition of taels, large bars will only be a kind of commodity. If it is to become silver coins, it must go through the central mint for minting. Once silver taels are abolished, the right to valuation will be transferred to the central bank. Due to the above two reasons, foreign banks advocate delay, or they may be affected by the concept of private interests, hoping to retain their control.</p>

<p>According to a Hua Lian News Agency report from this city on the 7th, Japanese military and political figures in Shanghai have been discussing for days and decided to advise Japanese residents in Nanjing to move to Shanghai or return to their country. It is reported that the content of the dispatch is advisory in nature. If the Japanese residents voluntarily stay in Nanjing, it is also fine. However, the purpose of this move by the Japanese authorities is still unclear.</p>

<p>The rear office of the 19th Route Army, since the end of the Shanghai Battle, had many unfinished procedures that needed to be handled in connection with various sectors. Therefore, the Shanghai Liaison Office was organized in the Army Club on West Temple Bridge Road (i.e., Jinji Road). It is now heard that the office has completed all matters related to liaison and closing procedures. All commemorative medals made and presented to various donors during the Shanghai War have also been issued. Therefore, the office is scheduled to formally close today. For matters that have not yet been completed, personnel will be left at the office attached to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office to handle them.</p>

<p>When the Chinese government sent special envoy Zhang Ming to handle Sino-Nepalese diplomatic relations this time, the King of Nepal brought many gifts when he conferred the rank of General of the Army on the King. Now, taking advantage of the return of Special Envoy Zhang Ming to China, it is heard that the King of Nepal specially presented Mr. Chiang with ivory carvings, musk, ancient bronze Buddha lions, gold pounds, gold cotton, clothing, gold-inlaid precious knives, embroidered gold clothes, and various rare treasures. It is heard that Mr. Chiang has sent aide-de-camp Luo Dongfan to Special Envoy Zhang's office to collect them. There is also a box of gifts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which Special Envoy Zhang handed over to the aide-de-camp to load onto the train to Beijing. In addition, Chairman Chiang telegraphed Envoy Zhang, saying, "Envoy Zhang, the Mingxun Jian, I have received your telegram, I am very pleased to see you returning to the country from Nepal, please come to Wuhan as soon as possible for a discussion," seal of Zhongzheng.</p>

<p>Feng Yuxiang sent a telegram, reading, "To the comrades of the Guangzhou Kuomintang of China, Central Executive Committee, and Southwestern Executive Department, I have read the Amnesty Telegram, it is indeed the only way out for national survival. To save the country from danger, there is no other way. After admiring it, I present my views. Since the September 18th and January 28th incidents, the Japanese have been making gradual encroachments, their ambitions have never been lessened. Their aim is to seize our entire territory and exterminate our entire nation. The only plan for now is to resist desperately. Recalling the fall of the Northeast, it has been more than ten months, one person blocks the way, the whole country is helpless, long-term resistance is deceiving ourselves. Although the volunteer army fought desperately, the authorities stood by and watched. What is even more incomprehensible is that they are so timid externally, but so brave in suppressing the people. Just taking the end of resisting goods as an example, since suppressing the anti-Japanese movement and disbanding the anti-Japanese groups, Japanese goods have been selling well in North China, and the import of Japanese goods in the Yangtze River has been flowing in continuously. The national spirit has been transformed from vigor to depression to the point of freezing. The authorities do not seek to save the country and do not allow the people to save the country. They do not resist with force and do not allow the people to resist economically. If we continue to delay and make mistakes like this, what are we waiting for to perish? Today, the Japanese are getting greedy, and will take another step to annex Jehol and sweep north of the Yellow River. The Song Dynasty's partial security eventually led to its destruction. The lessons of the past are not far away and can be chilling. I believe that the way to save the country is for the government to quickly make the greatest determination to resist Japan and punish traitors, concentrate its troops, recover the Northeast, restore the people's patriotic movement, strictly implement economic severance, organize a national volunteer army, and implement total mobilization to fight the violent Japanese to the death. It is better to die in war than to die without a fight. There is a way to survive by seeking life in death. The survival of the nation depends on this move. I hope that the comrades will continue to advocate the amnesty telegram and strive for its realization. Yuxiang is not clever, and I am willing to do my best to overcome national difficulties together. Respectfully submit my humble opinion, hoping you will consider it carefully. Feng Yuxiang bows, 30th."</p>
<h3 id="e131">Declaration of the Iron Blood Group <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Declaration of the Suppression of Traitors Group of the China National Salvation Iron Blood Group reads, "Since the Northeast disaster, it has been more than ten months. The local officials and the ruling officials have wrongly advocated non-resistance to resist the enemy. Then they resorted to empty words and long-term resistance, and sat idly by and watched the failure of the Shanghai Battle, allowing the Japanese invaders to calmly arrange to establish a puppet state, sending 30 million compatriots in the Northeast to sink into the sea of suffering, enduring their devastation under the iron hooves, and ruining tens of thousands of miles of beautiful mountains and rivers. Today, the enemy intends to invade Jehol again and peep at Tianjin and Beijing. All kinds of conspiracies have emerged one after another. All of our people are heartbroken and weeping with blood, knowing that the government cannot be relied upon, so they automatically organize volunteer armies to save the critical situation. However, they are also jealous of the government and forced to disband. They then use resisting enemy goods as the last resistance, but unexpectedly treacherous merchants emerge, protecting and transporting goods, or even using corrupt officials and politicians as amulets. There are also crazy people who raise the prices of domestic goods to take advantage of them. This kind of resistance is tantamount to promoting it on their behalf. To promote this is tantamount to killing our compatriots. If we do not quickly rise up to eliminate it, the harm will be endless. Our group, in view of this, has the organization of the Suppression of Traitors Group, with the spirit of unyielding and unbending, and the purpose of saving the country and the people (with the specific task of eliminating treacherous merchants and madmen. If there is anything that benefits society and the country, we will sincerely support it. If there is any infringement of rights and violation of public reason, our group will do its best to eliminate it. Our group members vow to put life and death aside. What we cannot ignore is the destruction of the country and the enslavement of the people. Our group has no relationship whatsoever, does not involve red ideology, is purely patriotic in conscience, and does not involve public security. This is the declaration, hoping you will consider it. The China National Salvation Iron Blood Group, August, 21st year.</p>

<p>During the Shanghai Battle, for the sake of national survival and to win glory for the country, more than 80 army officers led by example and died for the country. The Daxin Fengshuguan Bookstore on Sanma Road sent people to the military camp to collect all the portraits of the martyrs without omission. Now, a large-format collotype print is exquisitely printed. Under each portrait, there is a detailed and eye-catching name and resume. Each one is full of heroic spirit, as if alive. Since its release, it has attracted the purchase of various groups, schools, overseas compatriots, and patriotic women to commemorate it. It is also heard that the museum aims to ensure that all compatriots across the country have this commemorative piece, so the price is only set to cover the cost of 3 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e134">After the New Rice From Pudong Came on the Market <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>▲ Rice Prices Fall Gradually</p>
<p>The earliest new rice produced in Shanghai's rice market has always been from Zhoupu and other places in Pudong, and this year's production is even earlier than last year. Since the end of last month, since new rice from Pudong came on the market, the arrival of goods has been booming day by day. The initial opening price was 15 yuan per stone, but sales were sluggish, so the arriving goods could not be sold out immediately. Therefore, the opening price gradually fell. However, it has only been ten days since it came on the market, and yesterday the high-quality goods opened at 13 yuan and 2 jiao, a price drop of more than 1 yuan and 8 jiao compared to before. It is said that the harvest in the Pudong area is still good, and the quality of the goods shipped is also not inferior. Currently, only three or four production areas are harvesting. In the future, as new rice from various places in Pudong is harvested, the source of supply to Shanghai will become even more abundant. Since new rice has come on the market, the sales of japonica rice and foreign rice have been unusually sluggish. Various rice shops, seeing the low price of the new rice, are waiting and watching before buying, so the market price is difficult to improve. However, the supply of high-quality rice is scarce, and the price remains firm. The harvest of rice from Xixin, Suzhou, Songjiang, Changshu, and Wuxi is the largest, and the harvest is later. In previous years, new rice always came on the market at the end of September. According to people in the industry, they recently received letters from the Changshu and Wuxi production areas reporting that the fields have been abnormally arid due to the lack of rain for a long time. Although there is no damage at the moment, if it does not rain again, the fields will definitely be damaged in the future, and the harvest will be difficult to be bountiful.</p>

<h3 id="e136">The Relationship Between the Northern Goods Industry and the Zhuang Ke <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>On June 20th, Nanshi Dingtai, Changtai, Xinchengtai, and Xinbei, northern goods firms, entrusted lawyer Yin Shijie and accountant Pan Xulun to declare liquidation in the newspaper. There were debts owed to Hengxingmao, Hengxingsheng, Dajuchun, Wanchang, and Qianyuan and other firms in Songjiang. The Northern Goods Industry Association's reply to the Jiang County Chamber of Commerce requesting the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward the official letters between the two parties is recorded as follows: (1) Official letter from the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Northern Goods Industry Association, (Excerpted) We received an official letter from the Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce this month, stating that according to a letter from the Songjiang Southern Goods, Tea, and Food Industry Association, "Our members Hengxingmao, Hengxingsheng, Dajuchun, Wanchang, and Qianyuan stated in a letter that our members have always purchased goods from Shanghai through Zhuang Ke Jiang Jinru, and all payments have been cleared on time. However, after the bankruptcy of Shanghai Dingtai, Changtai, Xinchengtai, and Xinbei, three firms, this year, the entrusted lawyer Yin Shijie, in liquidation, suddenly received a letter from lawyer Yin on July 8, claiming that our members owed various amounts of money to Dingtai and other three firms, and immediately prepared a reply denying it. It has been a long-standing practice in our industry to have Zhuang Ke. Inland stores purchase goods through Zhuang Ke. Therefore, the invoices are sent by each firm to the Zhuang Ke for indirect transfer, and the remittances are also handed over to the Zhuang Ke for indirect payment. The existence of Zhuang Ke in our industry is no different from the existence of brokers in the stock exchange. Zhuang Ke's handling of goods is the same as brokers acting as buyers and sellers. Moreover, our members have receipts and invoices for all transactions. However, lawyer Yin repeatedly urges us by letter, and the procedures are wrong. Moreover, a notice is posted in the Shanghai Northern Goods Industry Association, prohibiting the industry from selling various goods to our members. Please provide assistance." Based on this, a temporary meeting was convened on July 26 to discuss the response. After public discussion, it was decided that, based on the above circumstances, a letter should be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, instructing the Shanghai Northern Goods Industry Association to withdraw the notice posted by Hengxingmao and other associations in order to protect their reputation, etc., recorded in the minutes. Accordingly, a letter is sent for your information and implementation. The details are as follows. Please reply clearly so that we can forward the letter. (2) The Northern Goods Industry's reply to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, In reply, we received a letter containing (Excerpted) etc. Article 2 of our industry rules states that when customers patronize transactions, they should register the invoice number and pay the money. Article 3 states that inland customers and Zhuang Ke are originally partners and should communicate with each other without any gaps. If the customer is in trouble, the Zhuang Ke should be responsible for compensation. If the Zhuang Ke is in debt, the amount owed should be collected from the inland customer. If they shirk responsibility, they should gather at the industry association meeting to deal with it. The nature of the Shanghai Zhuang Ke is that they are the purchasers entrusted by the inland merchants, in other words, they are the employees of the inland merchants. Therefore, usually, inland merchants purchase goods from our industry through the Shanghai Zhuang Ke, and the invoices are registered with the brand names of the inland stores. The receipt of money is based on the receipts of the firms. It has been followed for decades without any difference. Moreover, this practice is not only the case in our industry, but also in other industries such as the sugar industry, seafood industry, miscellaneous goods industry, and longan industry. Their rules are roughly the same. Now, the statements made by Hengxingmao, Juxingsheng, Dajuchun, Wanchang, Qianyuan, and others are completely contrary to the facts and without sufficient reason. The fact that the Zhuang Ke collected money from these firms is that the Zhuang Ke collected it privately. It is actually the inland merchants who are negligent in using their own personnel. It is already a very serious negligence. Now they do not blame themselves but instead blame others. This is the first contradiction. It is also claimed that they have receipts as evidence. The so-called receipts are the receipts of the Zhuang Ke, not the receipts of the firms. If they were indeed receipts from the firms, how could there be a reason to claim the debt again? This is the second contradiction. It is also claimed that the existence of Zhuang Ke in our industry is no different from the brokers in the stock exchange. This is an even more far-fetched analogy. It is important to know that in the stock exchange, both the buyer and the seller recognize the broker as the basis, and only the margin is the goal of short selling and long buying. They do not ask who the buyer is or who the seller is. Our industry and other industries such as the sugar industry, seafood industry, miscellaneous goods industry, and longan industry are purely formal transactions and not speculative in nature. Therefore, they all trust the brand names of the inland stores as the main body, and the Zhuang Ke is completely the manager of the inland merchants. Why do Hengxingmao and others try to shirk responsibility and not understand the truth to this extent? This is the third contradiction. The posting of a notice is a natural measure for our industry to fulfill its duties and deal with the matter in accordance with the rules. Based on the above rules and practices, our industry Dingtai, etc., has not violated anything. We should give a detailed reply and hope that you will carefully examine it, approve the forwarding of the letter to the Songjiang County Chamber of Commerce, and ask the Chamber of Commerce to consult the Songjiang Southern Goods, Tea, and Food Industry Association and forward it to Hengxingmao, Hengxingsheng, Dajuchun, Wanchang, and Qianyuan, etc., to quickly clear the debts owed to Dingtai, Changtai, Xinchengtai, and Xinbei three firms, and to transfer the debts to facilitate the closing. We sincerely request your friendship.

<p>▲ Mr. Zhang Dies with Unclosed Eyes</p>
<p>Jin Cuiyu, a Shanghai Ningbo Opera actress, aged 24, fell in love with Mr. Zhang, who was in the electrical business, five years ago and lived together in a rented house for five years. Later, they broke up halfway and separated a few months ago. Recently, Mr. Zhang suddenly died of a serious illness. Jin rushed to the scene before Zhang's body was even in a coffin, arguing over the furniture in the room. The details of this incident are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Extravagant Lifestyle: Mr. Zhang was in the electrical business and had a good monthly income. In addition to renting a house for his wife in Guian Lane in the French Concession, he cohabitated with Jin Cuiyu, a Ningbo Opera actress, five years ago. Initially, they rented a house on Zhejiang Road in the International Settlement and purchased furniture, silk mosquito nets, and other supplies, spending a total of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan over the years.</p>
<p>▲ Empty Room: In the early summer of this year, Zhang was sued in the International Settlement, and Jin took advantage of this to break up with Zhang, planning to go to Hankou to join an opera troupe and leave Shanghai. (Actually, she only left Zhang but not Shanghai). She rented a house elsewhere. As a result, the house rented by Zhang was left empty for several months. Last month, Zhang's lawsuit was resolved, and he moved the furniture from this room to the upstairs of a certain parlor in Renmei Lane in the French Concession. The arrangement of the room remained the same, and Zhang even hung Jin's photo in the room, hoping that Jin would return soon.</p>
<p>▲ Arriving During the Funeral: Recently, due to the hot weather and the prevalence of epidemics, Zhang suddenly died of a serious illness in his residence in Guian Lane a few days ago. While relatives and friends were gathering to discuss funeral arrangements, Jin Cuiyu received the news and rushed to the scene. She wanted to argue over the furniture and boxes in the room in Renmei Lane, claiming that they were purchased with her own money and did not belong to Zhang. After repeated discussions, it was decided that Jin Cuiyu would pay a certain amount of funeral expenses before she was allowed to take away the furniture.</p>

<p>To the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Respectfully, upon reading the article "Boatmen and Police Officers Fight" in the news column of your newspaper on the 5th of this month, it is inconsistent with the facts. It was found that at around 6 p.m. on the 3rd of this month, two stone boats loaded with stones from the Tangkou Bureau were moored at the black floating point outside Wusongkou. Due to the wind and tide, they could not reach their destination for unloading, so the boatmen were playing mahjong on the boat for recreation. Suddenly, two armed water police officers came to the boat to arrest them. The boatmen panicked and fled, which angered the water police officers, who threatened them with guns. One of the boatmen fell into the water and has not been found since. Seeing this situation, the boatmen argued with the water police officers, and it was alleged that the water police officers lost a wooden-cased gun with a Kowloon belt. Seeing that it had resulted in a death and that they had lost their weapons, the water police officers returned to the team on the grounds that the boatmen were resisting arrest and sent more water police officers to the boat for a second time. They arrested all the boatmen on both ships (except for one who fell into the water and one child who was watching the boat), totaling nine people. The families of the arrested boatmen have entrusted this lawyer with legal relief. The news previously published in your newspaper is inconsistent with the facts, and I am afraid that it will cause misunderstandings from the outside world. Therefore, I have prepared this letter requesting your newspaper to correct it in the letter column in order to clarify the truth and show the facts. I wish you good health.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Guo Luo Commits Suicide <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspapers reported two more suicide cases. One was Guo Mingxing, nephew of Guo Songling, who committed suicide in Hangzhou due to excessive stimulation. The other was Luo Yancun, a student at Qingdao University, who committed suicide because he felt unjustly expelled from school. I believe that neither of these cases warranted suicide. This is a sign of the weak will and lack of deep, strong character among young people today. Because to be a person, one must fight one's way out of hardship and difficulty; that is the true path to survival. A career built from overcoming obstacles is a true career. If one resorts to suicide after a single failure or setback, that mentality is completely wrong.</p>
<p>(1) Guo Mingxing, nephew of Guo Songling, whose entire family was brutally murdered, even if he had personally avenged them, it would not have been enough to vent his irreconcilable hatred. Therefore, he wanted to sneak into the border region of Heilongjiang Province to gather his father's old troops and resist the Japanese army. This was such a great ambition that it is truly admirable. Unexpectedly, due to the exhaustion of travel funds, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts, which was a great mistake. To seek revenge, one must preserve one's own existence, so that revenge can be achieved. If one destroys oneself first, it is equivalent to not wanting to take revenge and being avenged by the enemy first. This is one reason why he should not have died. Moreover, people are afraid of sacrifice, but if they are willing to sacrifice, they should obtain a corresponding price. Even if Guo could not gather his father's old troops to resist the Japanese army, even individual sacrifice could still obtain a corresponding price, then his sacrifice would have value. In the past, Wu Zixu was willing to play the flute in the market of Wu to avenge the murder of his father, and Shen Baoxu cried for seven days and seven nights in the Qin court to restore the state of Wu, and finally avenged the state of Wu. What a fierce, meaningful, and valuable revenge!</p>
<p>(2) Luo Zicun, because his family was poor and unable to afford schooling, received assistance from the provincial government and relatives to enter Qingdao University. However, due to student unrest at Qingdao University, Luo was expelled, and he felt he had no face to return home, so he committed suicide passively. I have two opinions to explain this. First, the school authorities expelled Luo, but Luo asked himself if he had violated school rules or failed any exams. This was an error on the part of the school authorities, and Luo only needed to have a clear conscience. It can be said that it had nothing to do with Luo. Second, if expulsion means a damaged reputation and no chance to transfer, I have a suggestion. I ask, can a university diploma be pawned nowadays? Can it be exchanged for food? On the one hand, there are more and more university graduates, and on the other hand, many university graduates are illiterate and unable to translate an English article. There are many such people. One studies because one wants to learn, not because of a diploma. Therefore, the ninety-three-year-old Ma Xiangbo once said that graduating from middle school is like getting a key to a bookcase. If you want to study any subject, you just need to find it yourself. So, it is not necessarily the case that a university graduate is knowledgeable, and a non-university graduate is ignorant. Originally, universities are now aristocratic; only the children of a few capitalists have the privilege of studying there. Poor children can only crane their necks and look in from the outside. (I have vowed that when I study in the future, I plan to organize a large-scale academic society where all poor children can join and freely discuss and study with each other, but there is no concrete plan yet.) Look at the famous scholars of ancient times, who initially were herdsmen or slaves, or studied by the light of snow or fireflies, or pricked their thighs with awls, and eventually became the masters of their generation. There are countless such examples. Why must one go to an aristocratic university to study now?</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the issue of studying, I have no hope of helping the country or society in any way. Young people should find their own solutions and ways out, especially poor students. They should study hard and diligently on their own. Universities cannot be relied on, teachers cannot be relied on, and money cannot be relied on. Only your own great and intelligent brain is the most reliable. If you spend two or three thousand dollars to buy a worthless diploma, what is the use? What is its value?</p>

<h3 id="e167">Occasional Thoughts While Strolling in the Bund Park <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Hongshan</p>
<p>A wandering traveler, living in Shanghai, with few social interactions and friends, feeling bored on a summer day, with the scorching sun setting, I strolled through the Bund Park and was moved to write: The Yangtze River flows leisurely, the trees on the Bund are lush, the sun sets and the birds want to roost, seen far in the depths of the forest. White cicadas bloom in order, green reeds brush the water obliquely, the vegetation is full of human intention, quiet and beautiful.</p>
<p>Standing by the embankment, the sea breeze takes advantage of the cool evening, brushing past shoulders. Who passed by? A faint fragrance of night-blooming jasmine is heard. Disordered masts dot the night like stars, shining faintly beyond the Bund. Borrowing the mood of the Pearl River, it must be lacking songs and music.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Machine Oil <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Zuo</p>
<p>Machine oil (lubricant) is the common name for lubricating material. Most people do not pay much attention to it, but they do not know that it has made a great contribution to modern civilization. Without it, the countless shafts that provide clothing, food, supplies, and knowledge would come to a halt; all machines, from small watches to the turbines of power plants, would stop working; factories and transportation equipment would stagnate, and the source of food and other necessities would be cut off. The modern mechanical world was created by the invention of the axle, but the invention of machine oil helped to achieve this.</p>
<p>What is the function of machine oil? Before answering this question, we must first know what friction is. Try placing a very smooth surface under a microscope, and you will see countless thorns, like a cat's tongue. When two surfaces are pressed together and moved, these thorns hook into each other and impede movement. This impediment is called friction. The amount of friction depends entirely on the roughness of the surface and the amount of force applied.</p>
<p>The purpose of applying machine oil is to separate the two surfaces so that they do not pull on each other and can move freely. According to precise research, the oil film applied between the two surfaces is divided into at least three layers: the upper and lower layers are tightly attached to each surface and move with it, while the middle layer or layers are suspended in the middle. Therefore, what slides over each other is actually liquid, not solid. This is how machine oil lubricates machine parts and makes them move freely.</p>
<p>The thickness of the oil film between the two surfaces has no bearing on the lubrication effect. Someone once used A-rays to test that a thin layer of oil film only a few molecules thick applied to a car engine achieved an exceptionally satisfactory lubrication effect. All axles in the world are spinning rapidly on this magical oil film. When the axle is stationary, it touches the bottom of the bearing, squeezing the oil to the sides. But when the axle rotates, it draws the oil to the bottom, and the axle floats in the air, with the oil film as the bottom cushion. An experimenter once used precision instruments to measure that the axle rises about two to three thousandths of an inch when rotating.</p>

<h3 id="e169">The Prerequisite for Abolishing Superstition: How to Eliminate Superstition <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Hao</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ms. Ouyang published an article in this journal on abolishing superstition, advocating that the money wasted on praying to gods and worshipping Buddha should be used for undertakings beneficial to society and the country. I strongly agree with this view. However, I believe that it will be very difficult to achieve this goal unless the superstitious beliefs of the general public are first removed. Therefore, there is a prerequisite: how to eliminate superstition?</p>
<p>The meaning of (superstition) is to believe in something while confused and without awareness. Because it is a kind of confused and unaware belief, it is deeply ingrained in the mind and very difficult to break. The superstitious belief in ghosts and gods among the general public in our country has been subtly instilled since childhood and deeply imprinted in their minds, making it difficult to eradicate. Although there has been a slogan of "overthrowing superstition" circulating in society in recent years, the potential power of superstition is still very strong, and most people are still heavily intoxicated by demons and unaware of themselves. We only need to go to the Hongmiao Temple and the City God Temple to see that every day, many men, women, old and young, are very enthusiastically and solemnly burning incense, lighting candles, chanting, and worshipping Buddha. Shanghai is a very modern place, yet it is still like this. The situation in other provinces and counties can naturally be imagined. Moreover, most superstitious people are very stubborn and unreasonable. If you tell them that praying to gods and worshipping Buddha cannot bring blessings or ward off disasters and is a futile act, no one will pay attention to you. No matter how sufficient your reasons are or how clearly you explain, they will never be convinced. Because they have been held captive by the evil demon and are difficult to free. The author has repeatedly promoted the elimination of superstition at home but has been severely criticized, and family relationships have almost been broken as a result. The difficulty of eradicating superstition can be seen from this. Therefore, I believe that the (superstition) problem is really a very important social problem in our country and also the most difficult problem to solve.</p>
<h3 id="e170">A True Story from an Examination <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Hou Ying</p>
<p>Inside XX Middle School, many new students were taking exams in history, geography, and nature.</p>
<p>"Hey! Hey, excuse me, is Tianjin in Shandong Province?"</p>
<p>A short, stocky friend asked a slightly taller friend sitting next to him. The slightly taller friend first looked up at the proctor, then gently said to him, "Yes." But on his own test paper, he wrote the three characters "Hebei Province" in pencil.</p>
<p>The three major river basins of China? (1) Yangtze River, (2) Yellow River, (3) ... Oh: the Yangtze River!"</p>
<p>The short friend put down his pen, held his head in both hands, and just kept thinking.</p>
<p>"That's right, it must be the Yangtze River!"</p>
<p>The short friend said to himself again, then picked up his pen and wrote in what he thought was the correct (three major river basins of China).</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the slightly taller friend had finished all ten questions. He stood up to hand in his paper. When he came back, he saw the short friend's answer to the third question:</p>
<p>(China was unified by foreign ethnic groups twice), (Answer: Tang and Song.)</p>
<p>The slightly taller friend could not help but sneer. Later, he learned that he was the son of an XX teacher, and his name was XX.</p>
<p>Several days later, the list of new students admitted to XX Middle School was announced. The taller friend also took a newspaper and looked at it, but no matter how he looked, he could not find his name, but only the three characters XX were prominently displayed before his eyes!</p>
