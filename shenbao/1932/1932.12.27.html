<p>連日日軍又大舉進窺熱河。最前線且已進抵朝陽寺。與我義軍朱霽青·王蘊萍·孟昭炎·李海峯·馬子丹·諸部。迭有接觸。華北屏障。岌岌可危。於是華北各將領。乃有重開華北治安會議之議。擬根據上次政委會議决原則。再共同會商禦侮守土方策。急成燃眉。始議守土。沉沉酣夢。今日果已醒耶。雖然。往者已矣。但使羊羣亡後。尙肯補牢。則此種會議。固亦極足以令吾人之注目也。</p>
<p>夫日人目中之所謂「滿蒙。」乃兼包東三省及熱河察哈爾兩省而言。故旣得東省。進一步囊括熱察。實爲勢所必至。當今歲一月錦州失守之後。日軍即曾一度進迫熱邊。旋以義軍四起。兵力不敷分配。情勢始轉和緩。七月中又藉口石本事件。傾力來犯。我義軍接戰極烈。一時熱邊形勢驟緊。自是以後。時緩時急。熱河一省。孤懸塞外。蓋已無日不在危急之中。脫無義軍各方牽掣。或亦早已爲遼吉黑之續矣。今者我馬占山部。旣已退集一隅。蘇炳文所部數萬救國軍。亦慘遭挫敗。其他各路義軍。如馮占海等亦皆以後援不繼。餉彈兩缺。次第漸呈不支之勢。日軍至是。顧慮已少。於是熱河乃不免於益呈危急。嗚呼。日人之於熱河。固早已志在必得。積時逾載。華北軍事當局。迄未聞有所籌謀。期以死力保此落照中之孤城。且坐視赤手空拳以血肉相搏之東北各路義軍。爲敵人各個擊破。進一步而得以安然窺熱。於此而始有「華北治安」之協議。已覺其晚。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人所望於華北治安會議者。蓋亦至爲殷切。蓋熱河爲華北屏藩。熱如失守。華北即將朝不保夕。華北各將領自張學良以下。皆擁有重兵。鑒於前此不抵抗之失。今後應如何竭盡全力。積極援救熱河。使熱省不爲東北三省之續。此其一也。榆關之險。早已與敵共之。日軍旣進窺熱河。爲牽掣我後援計。必將於榆關方面。同時用兵。華北各軍。究將應如何死守防地。濺三軍之熱血。保此天險。此其二也。我國之軍人。見惡於人民久矣。然而人民究何惡於軍人。苟其能盡職衛國。方將簞食壺漿。奉之若父母。觀夫各地人民對東北義軍及十九路軍之熱烈援助。即其例證。故昔之辱國失地者。苟欲長免於國人之唾棄。則今日應即下必死之决心。準備作壯烈之犧牲。此正其時。三也。</p>
<p>其次。吾人亦有須爲吾國民告者。東北淪亡。已逾一載。即熱河之危急。亦不自今日始。國人之應積極援助東北義軍。使敵人鐵蹄。不獲迅速踏遍東北三省寖以及於熱河。吾人前已一再言之。今日者熱河又危在旦夕間矣。華北治安會議之結果。對於軍事上。將有若何之凖備。爲另一問題。而吾人之應加緊援助義軍。以牽掣敵人。則萬萬不容再有須臾之遲延。義軍者我人民眞正之武力也。義軍不存。熱河不保。熱河不保。華北亦行且不爲我有矣。燎原之火。一日千里。瞬息將及於吾人之身。國人乎。事急矣。今日而不欲求生則已。否則當此生死關頭。即應激起吾人萬衆之熱力。以與當前之强敵作一最後之死搏。</p>

<p>國民社二十四日柏林電　今日從此間可靠方面探悉、史丹林將於一月五日發表一急進改革農業計劃、即徵調穀物制度亦將取消、蓋蘇俄在五年計劃中、過於側重工業、致農業爲其犧牲品、農民不僅心懷怨望、且大都怠於作業、因此時患糧食缺乏、民有飢色、國内反對史氏政策者遂日衆、故有此大舉改革計劃、將於一月五日召集共黨中央委員會特别會議提出通過、據聞屆時史氏將有重要演說、至穀物徵調制完全取消後、將代以徵稅制、照所耕畝數徵抽賦稅、第以物品代表貨幣繳稅而已、</p>

<p>匪巢穴洪湖之視察</p>
<p>（徵稅制度）洪湖共匪所徵之租稅、分爲土地稅·營業稅·關稅房租等項、茲特略述於下、㈠土地稅、該稅按照田畝收穫量與農民階層收稅、以全年計算、分春秋兩季徵收、其稅率、以百元起碼、富農百元徵百分之十五、中農百分之五、貧農百分之三、餘類推、㈡營業稅、該稅累進徵收、資本在五十元至二百元、徵收百分之二、二百元至三百元、百分之二·五、三百元至四百元、百分之三、四百元至五百元、百分之三·五、五百元至六百元、百分之四、六百元至八百元、百分之四·五、八百元至一千元、百分之五、其餘按率遞增、㈢關稅、洪湖共匪在湖口及要道設有關卡、徵收進出口關稅、出口入口、均以五十元起碼、征收百分之一、經過赤區之非赤區商人、資本在五千元以上者、所徵關稅、須根據累進營業稅比例征收、共匪爲救濟赤區糧食恐慌起見、對於進口糧食、免除關稅、以便鼓勵米商經常販運、㈣房租、匪區被没收之房屋、在鄕村隨土地分與雇貧中農居住、各大市鎭、除留作各機關辦公外、其餘由「蘇維埃」按照市價收納租金、對於私有出租之房屋、亦向房東徵收房地稅、以上各項爲共匪正規之稅收、其後因入不敷出、遂巧立名目、創設擁護紅軍捐等、敲骨及髓、苛歛百出、匪區民衆遂益無以爲生矣、</p>
<p>（赤化敎育）洪湖共匪、對於赤化敎育、異常重視、組織「文化委員會」專司其事、盡量灌輸共產主義、使一般愚民受其麻醉、其敎育方法、分社會敎育國民敎育兩種、社會敎育、以工農俱樂部爲中心、設立閱報室·讀報班·講演所·新劇台等、隨時灌輸共產主義、此外更用種種集會方式、以行其赤化羣衆之社會敎育、對於國民敎育則設列寗小學、赤化幼齡　童、並設立夜學校或半日學校、對一般失學民衆、灌輸共產智識、種種規劃、極爲周密、</p>
<p>（對外交通）洪湖共匪、爲謀物質上之補充起見、對外交通、秘密維持、新堤爲其出入要口、米糧食鹽等項之日用必需物品、多取給於此、其由上海派往匪區之工作人員、及運輸各項機器、則由新堤西之白螺磯登岸、共匪預派船隻在該處迎候、由滬前往者、購票至沙市、中途在白螺磯轉登匪船、前往洪湖匪區、匪船均有暗號、大似梁山泊情景、至匪區對外貿易、則有商人從中經辦、來往商人、有共匪發給之通行證、及官軍所發之良民證爲護符、商人一到匪區、出其通行證以便通過、出匪區後、即將通行證藏匿、另持良民證、證明其身分、俾免危險、形成一種微妙通商關係、有以上種種不可思議之秘密交通、曩日官軍雖在圍勦之中、而共匪之對外交通、仍未完全斷絶者、職此故也、</p>
<p>（内部火併）洪湖共匪、内部派别複雜、意見紛歧、除極左之共匪外、有改組派、第三黨、ＡＢ團等、改組派、第三黨、ＡＢ團、在匪巢攻克以前、大聯合以謀推倒極左派、預定九月十五日舉事、乃事機不密、被極左派先發制人、自九月十三日起、開始所謂肅反工作、先後逮捕彼等所認爲反動分子一千餘人、共匪黨政軍中重要人員牽連入獄者、不可勝計、人心惶惶、咸感不安、其逮捕反動之際、所有被逮之重要人員、均以黑灰塗面、或用黑布蒙首、夜間押解、以避耳目、在匪巢攻破之前一二日、被捕人員大部就戮、在新溝方面、一夜曾殺七百餘人、屠殺之慘、聞之毛戴、共匪火併結果、内部騷然、人心渙散、國軍乘勢進攻、摧枯拉朽、不旋踵而掃穴犁庭矣、</p>
<p>（佔山佔水）國軍堵剿之際、洪湖共匪因巢穴感受威脅、内部對於安全問題、發生劇烈爭執、一派主張佔山、以爲佔山易守、力主放棄洪湖、向鄂西或湘西山中逃竄、派主張佔水、以爲洪湖地處鄂中、形勢險要、發展旣易、退守亦足與國軍相持、且經營數年、一旦放棄、殊爲可惜、兩派相爭、莫衷一是、最後佔山派獲得優勢、由賀龍挑選精銳二千餘人、向西另謀出路、王益民等率匪部扼守洪湖、「湘鄂西省蘇維埃」由瞿家灣遷至新溝咀、匪部主力、亦集中於此、其後第十軍徐源泉部大舉圍攻新溝、一鼓撲滅、洪湖殘匪遂不數日而告肅清、賀段以巢穴已破、遂向西竄、</p>
<p>（失敗原因）洪湖共匪聲勢浩大、此次一鼓殲滅、其失敗原因、約有下列數種、㈠剿辦洪湖共匪之十軍官兵、異常奮勇、計劃周密、進兵神速、共匪烏合、訓練較差、一遇勁敵、首尾不能相顧、新溝一役、全軍覆没、㈡共匪初以取消苛捐雜稅、平分土地、解除民衆痛苦、誘惑鄕愚結果苛捐雜稅、名廢實存、平分土地、有名無實、加以反富農鬥爭、農民不安、任意殺戮、人人自危、匪區民衆所受痛苦、較之赤化以前奚啻百倍、人民在積威之下雖敢怒而不敢言、然衆心離叛、覺悟其欺詐、思所以自返矣、㈢互相火併、自毁藩籬、内部統一之戰線旣破、國軍堵剿之進攻自易、㈣攻守之策、爭論不决、對於國軍進勦、防禦上之整個計畫未成、而國軍突進、倉皇應戰、旗靡轍亂、有此種種原因、故共匪經營數載之洪湖、遂告克復、而嘯聚多年之精銳、亦一旦消減殆盡、（未完）</p>

<p>劉有爲君來函</p>
<p>今日貴報所載宋世澤君之函與貴記者答覆宋君的話，我讀了之後，發生以下的感想：㈠在現社會的狀况之下，封建餘孼的腐敗家庭，是不會根本剷除的；宋君的問題，也就不會根本解决。㈡勸宋君的母親找職業，自己操作，自是正當辦法，然而說到找職業，「談何容易？」現在有許多大學畢業生都找不到二三十塊錢一月的生活，一個半老而木訥的舊式太太，又上那裏找職業去？若果宋君想然與她脫離關係，似乎不近人情。㈢宋君之父及其所納之妾固然是「生活於舊社會的，卽封建餘孼的範疇中」不能自殺、只有讓他「坐以待斃」，辦法到痛快，然而今日社會中像宋君之父母這像的人，恐的還不在少數、若果一一聽其自生自滅，那也不是我們研究社會問題的人所應有態度，質之宋君及貴記者以爲何如？</p>
<p>答：來書所說，掁有卓見，然而我們研究社會問題，尤其是與讀者研究各人自身所感受的迫切問題，應當分兩種步驟：第一步盡我們的管見所及替讀者貢獻一些實際解决的方法，使他不致失望而去，答非所問。第二步，每一個實際問題，若果只從實際的，個别現象去求解决，忽略了牠的社會的經濟的根本原因，即動力之動力，那讀者雖得到相當的解决，却是没有根本解决牠的社會根源，所以應該隨時隨地點醒讀者，使大家不要只顧現實的個别現象而忘却這一現象背後的原因與普通的關聯。昨日答覆宋君之言，係僅就他目前所急待解决的問題，聊供所見：至若宋君這種家庭狀况，在中國還是一大部分，至少是舊社會中一大部份的普遍現象，要解决這個問題，當非一蹴可及：若果眞想救濟，那至少要有如下條件：㈠全國的資本主義化或在民衆政權之下的全國工業化；㈡用嚴刑峻罰，實行禁烟，不得明令禁化而暗中又獎勵；嚴禁娶妾；凡娶妾者不得享有公民權；㈣用國家全力施行普及敎育，中學敎育完全由國家供給經費，學生不論階級性别，一律免費：㈤無條件地，許人民有集會結社出版之自由，使人民的聰明才力，盡量發揮，不致淹没，殘折人民向上努力的興趣與心情：㈥青年學生與幼童的受敎育權有絶對的保障，若在求學年齡而失學者，父兄應處以重典，必須大動干戈，掀動了社會的大波浪，絶非現在政治經濟狀况之下、所能想像得到的。記者對於宋君之父及其所納之妾的救濟問題，暫存而不論並恝然置之者此也。至於記者主張宋君到了不得已時（她不聽他的勸告），與她脫離關係，看來似乎不對，其實這全從整個社會立場出發的，宋君與其母同居，結果兩人都没有出路，而爲社會前途計，暫置宋君之母而使宋君得解脫，也是『兩害相權，取其輕者』的意思，這或許要引起明倫堂中的老爹們的嗟歎與非難也未可知！足下以爲如何？</p>
<h3 id="c162">㈡這是整個社會問題 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>｜朱嬰君來信｜</p>
<p>（關於翁君所提經濟壓迫問題討論之討論，翁君原函及朱君討論函見十月十九日及二十二日本欄）</p>
<p>你答復的幾點，大體是認爲滿意的。不過貴報旣專題一欄，爲讀者解决一些難解决的問題，大家有什麽欵難不决，聽到這個消息，未嘗不歡迎欲狂，而一經貴報答復了以後，未嘗不奉之如指針，以爲此後就有辦法了。所以貴報立言要愼重，能部分解决的，便替他解决，否則只好告訴他叧外的出路，至少也得闕疑呵！如貴報答復翁君的信，說：「只要吃得苦，總不會餓死」。在目前中國的社會，這句話似乎太肯定了一點。要知道雖在上海這個地方，表面看來似乎很富庶，而要是一個能吃苦的窮人平日不多少靠親朋的接濟，餓死的怕不知有多少！先生如肯作深入的觀察，便知道了。照這樣看來，翁君得了貴報的答復，若便信以爲眞，將來他的校長職務萬一掉了，很吃苦的去找工，然不是工廠不添人，便是添人不要生手。又即或找着工，然不是工廠受時局的影響而關門，便是由於生產合理化的結果便你一天精疲力盡而得不着一飽。到這時，翁君一家人雖没有餓死，然也餓得像個半死；他到了無奈，只有走着自殺的路；一方面使社會對於貴報的指導也不信任了。如果貴報起初就很明白的告訴翁君：「這是整個社會的問題，要解决你個人的問題，就得要解决整個社會，至於救一時之急，也未嘗没有，不過是「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚」罷了。肯這樣掉轉頭來的說法，翁君看了，或者把他的重心移到改造社會方面去，一來免得他白費精神，二來也是貴報眞正盡了指導的使命。總而言之，現在的社會，不是「有無」的問題，而是「分配」的問題，這一點，很希望貴報毫不含糊地要告訴羣衆的。</p>
<p>我不是好辯，我希望貴報做一顆社會的明星，而且做一顆明星到永遠的將來，不知記者先生以爲何如？</p>
<p>覆：足下肯如此一瑞反復的同我們討論，我們深爲欣幸。足下談：我們應該起初就很明白的告訴翁君：「這是整個社會問題」，呌他起初就注重到改造社會方面去，其實，這層意思，在我們覆翁君原信裏，已經藏着，不過措詞稍爲隱約而已。餘意已詳前函，於此不再覆述，指示各點，敬謹拜嘉！</p>

<p>㈩歌曲宜多用長音階調、少用短音階調、</p>
<p>㈩㈠學生對於歌曲、宜令其忠實唱　、切禁隨意加入在腔滑調、使敎曲情趣流於卑劣、</p>
<p>㈩㈡講演「讀譜法」時、使學生有識譜能力外、更須令其練習寫譜、又於相當時期内、并須練習「聽音寫譜、</p>
<p>㈩㈢講演「音樂常識」時、宜多備關於聲樂器樂之著名唱片、隨時利用留聲機、使學生可多得欣賞之機會、又遇音樂名家之演奏、及當地舉行之音樂會等、必須令其兩席、</p>
<p>㈩㈣講演「和聲學」時、宜隨時舉實際樂曲、互相參照解釋、</p>

<p>東華　鐵門周賢言、昨日長袍馬褂、文質彬彬、偕其愛人張蒓蓀女士坐於一元座中詢以當此大戰、何以不出場之原因周答稱日前與蘭開夏一役、脚脛受傷尙未痊愈云、是以昨日之戰由阿陸（鍾恩）代庖前鋒陳洪光亦因脚傷未能出塲由萬象華任左内鋒錢敬鏞翼左觀衆覩此陣線無不爲東華擔憂待劇戰開始、東華實力非特未遭絲毫損失、反覺全隊精神奮發、陣容鞏固前鋒奔跑迅速破關進窺、每使對方不及措置家球虞添特别討好、在在如願以償爲所欲爲象華敬鏞嬌小玲瓏恰到妙處、中鋒李義臣脚頭殺辣射門竣急惜帶球傳遞、每有遲滯之弊前衛三人及内衛二人個個出色、個個盡力控制敵人牢不可破滿面殺氣精神抖擻縱使西捕前鋒强悍、亦無懈可擊守門阿陸夙以接救高球蜚聲海上但昨日不特接高球顯其拿手傑作、卽低球亦均能措置裕如、總之昨日之東華、陣容嚴整精神異常飽滿、</p>
<p>西捕昨日之西捕、其戰鬭力無不稍弱、惜無射門人才進至門下、亦屬徒然個人方面右内衛克勞福實　軟弱脚頭旣軟、又不能攔截敵人之前進前衛赫雷徒勞奔馳勞而無功、使陳虞添滔出滔進橫行無阻、此西捕之大損失大弱點也前鋒以活根生最出色老將威風的是非凡、吳幼良關洵安均不易阻擋、凡西捕進攻、球必由左面而上、挑送之佳、百不失一、可惜中路接濟軟弱功虧一簣、德飛乃前衛人材、今改任内鋒、宛如無頭蒼蠅、無所適從、派克傑克喔克萊三人、尙有可觀惜不能攻門、西捕之擎天玉柱中堅軋許、昨竟失怯老將資望茫無頭緒、但時露慌張之態、西捕之敗、謂爲軋許之咎亦非過也、</p>

<p>西捕大觸霉頭　西捕於開賽後兩分内、卽負一球、而此球之失、不能不歸罪於軋許之措置失當誤頂入自己門内、此卽西捕失敗之兆也、否則當此嚴重大賽何以能正投羅網自滅威風也、此爲西捕大不幸之一失此球後、西捕固未自甘示弱往後努力奮鬥、積極反攻、包圍東華球門、如聯珠砲射者達十餘分鐘、活根生連送出四五次絶妙角球、傑克派克有五六次射門竟一無建樹、此爲西捕大不幸之二、圍攻無效反被東華又攻入一球、此爲西捕大不幸之三、而後幾番辛苦、一再努力、還敬一球未幾又得罰十二碼球之機會固不難轉恨爲喜、化危爲安而造成二比二之平手也、詎料軋許一踼、竟爲東華守門陸鍾恩救出、錯過機會、自滅威風、否則造成二比二後、則以後之形勢、絶然不同或者結果相反、亦未可知此西捕大不幸之四西捕有此四點、謂爲其大觸霉頭、良有以也、</p>

<p>軋許倒戈鐘鳴三下、裁判員馬許爾號砲一響、大戰開始、東華開球、進不數　、西捕反壓過去、傑克帶球前進、李寗截出、軋許萬象華互失足、球爲錢敬鏞得、　壓門前、阻於克勞福卽傳送門前、球掠門向右、李義臣陳家球及西捕守門均未得、陳虞添趕上打門、軋許急慌中、　對球撞去、誤中自己門内、東華得此意外之喜、四週衆觀無不欣喜萬狀、離開賽不及二分鐘、可謂神速之至</p>
<p>滿城風雨　西捕遭此不幸萬分懊喪、乃整頓人馬、急起反攻、從此東華門前、滿城風雨、草木皆兵、喔克萊邊陲人寇、挑球送中傑克以頭迎之、球掠左方、活根生偷渡不遂、爲關洵安救出、西捕首次失機活根生不肯甘休帶球再進、傳中爲德飛得、再傳與派克、此君攻門太高二度失機赫雷逼得角球活根生妙送陸鍾恩躍起救之、西捕乃三度失機、活根生又送角球、又被阿陸救出、西捕乃四度失機、活根生憑一世之雄孤軍侵入、至相當地點傳中、傑克地位得當、大有一舉成功之勢屠開元見機不佳、追上截奪於是西捕五次失機、最後西捕六出祁山、喔克萊挑送角球、吳幼良阻住居活根生之行動而解危、派克攻門而被接、畢竟西捕無懈可擊、先後西捕攻門七次、聲勢殊盛、東華龍門、頃刻不安、東華力抗衆寇、無懈可擊、使觀者驚喜交集</p>
<p>偷鷄不遂　壓迫愈甚、反抗愈烈、東華久經壓迫、化險爲夷後、乃興兵反殺、虞添沿邊龔進、傳與家球攻門、甚急、守門擋出、西捕再攻、李寗失足、被派克溜進、但亦告失足恨、此後傑克派克又互有攻門、東華一一救出混戰多時、喔克萊踼出角球、雙方肉搏聲中、被派克踼進一球、但德飛　人犯規、於是偷鷄不遂反賠米、一塲空歡喜、</p>

<p>互建一功　再戰聲起、混戰有十分鐘互少精彩、忽見陳處添送出角球、西捕門將失守、李義臣候在門前、將球挺入門内、東華乃勝兩球西捕見勢不佳、全軍奮發、力圖進取、邊將喔克萊送球門前、在門角落下、活根生見球追上、看準球影、一頂人門爲狀殊美、遂成二比一、</p>
<p>十二碼球　西捕勝此球、精神益振、克勞福送球前方活根生帶前、盤過李寗、正擬攻門、因脚步慌亂失機、俄爾、西捕前鋒、全軍逼進、東華衛兵於百忙中犯規、被罰十二碼球、立定陣脚、東華將門阿陸靜觀時機、軋許奔前力踼、球對門之左角、阿陸已有先見之明、早已算中此着、雙手撲成角球、活根生又開成野球、化險百夷、喜出望外、東華　員、個個奔前向阿陸道賀、無不喜極欲狂、轉眼之間、虞添爽脆一脚、傳與小萬、忽而又爲李義臣得、橫身掃射、又應聲入網、比數乃成三比一、</p>
<p>匹馬單槍　西捕重創之後、軋許心殊不甘、乃調派克任中鋒、擬圖背城借一、但全無效果、忽聞右方邊疆、喊聲大起、蓋陳虞添匹馬單槍、躍馬挺進、盤過三關、對門力射、愛德門瞠目無策、祗有目送來球、如矢射入、比數乃成四比一、</p>
<p>百步穿楊　至此、東華之勝、已在掌握之中、而敵中衛線人困馬乏、已不若以前之聲勢可畏、混戰移時、仍無建樹派克得惠斯伍一勾之𦔳、帶球西下、過罰球線、再傳與傑克、再傳與�</p>
<p>德飛、吳幼良·關洵安兩騎奔來、不料將德飛絆倒、在罰球線上被踼在任意球、離門約有二十碼、軋許一脚低射、又對左門角、阿陸未有救十二碼球之先知先覺、球乃穿人網窩、開球未久、卽鳴金收兵、</p>

<p>再吸了兩口烟，她走到開着的窗口，將半寸多長的紙烟從窗口向外面馬　的空中抛了出去。</p>
<p>一點朱紅的火星在空中倐的劃了一道弧綫。</p>
<p>她走回來，走到牆角的箱子那裏。一顆棕黑的銀珠伸在帽子外面望着我：　　「假如你不見怪，我要換一件衣服。」</p>
<p>「要我走出去嗎？」我問。</p>
<p>「不用，回過臉去好了。」她已經在解着黑絨的上衣。</p>

<p>悉率悉率的幾聲，接着一隻鞋子被丢在地板上，接着又是一隻。</p>
<p>「好了，對不起你。」</p>
<p>我回過臉來，她已經除下了帽子，換了一身藍絨的便服，敞着胸口，露出裏面猩紅的胸衣，脚上拖着拖鞋。</p>
<p>第一次，我在她小小的臉上見到了兩顆棕黑的眼珠子。</p>
<p>暗藍的全身襯着頷下的一團紅色，我笑着說：</p>
<p>「你這樣子，下巴底下一塊紅的，眞像燕子啦！」</p>
<p>她一笑，開始用手扣着胸前的鈕扣。「他喜歡我穿這樣紅色的襯衣。你們男子有許多嗜好是我們不懂的。你說是嗎？」</p>
<p>我點點頭，拿起帽子。我說：「瑪麗或許要回來了。我要走了。」她望着我：</p>
<p>「可以嗎，將你住的地方告訴我。」我從衣袋裏掏出了剛才買的「黑猫牌」，撕了一點紙，將地名寫上，連着紙烟一同遞給了她。</p>
<p>「謝謝你。」她送着我走。「我第一眼看見你，就知道你和我是一樣的人。是嗎，你相信他一定會回來嗎？」</p>

<p>上了電梯，開電梯的說：「回來了，先生。」</p>

<p>「姓甚麽？」我問。從來没有來看我的女客人。</p>
<p>「她没有說，等了很久，留下一封信走了。」</p>
<p>他遞給我一封信。</p>
<p>望着公用信封上的不認識的稚拙的字跡，我嗤的一聲撕開了信封。</p>
<p>信紙上用鉛筆歪歪斜斜的寫着：「我來看你。爲什麽不來吃飯？今天下午在路上找到他，但他不睬我。你相信他會回來嗎？我仍相信的。！燕子。」</p>
<h3 id="c225">「自殺」與「被殺」 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 玄</p>
<p>今天讀了本刋所載郁達夫的「說死以及自殺情死之類，」就想起了我在日本報上所見他們日本人的自殺事件來。那是三年以前罷，我在日本京都看見大阪每日新聞上登載了一段驚人的自殺事件。死者是一個有家室有財產的人，不爲戀愛失敗，也不爲投機破產，徒因身體有病，自覺得再不能活潑潑地做一個健康的人了，他就取了自殺這一手段。先殺了妻和一子一女，（妻的自殺，大槪是同意的，）這位身患痼疾者就鎖了家門，到銀行裏提取了一部分的存欵，漫遊了一個月，然後再打電話給他的在東京外務省當差的哥哥，說明了他全家的「慘劇，」於是他自己也就自刎在妻和兒女的屍邊。</p>
<p>這是一種變態心理的自殺，然而在變態心理的背後，我們却看見一個健康的心在那裏跳躍：這就是對於人生態度的嚴肅認眞，絲毫不肯苟且！旣然不能活潑潑地做一個健康的人，旣然不能克盡健康的人們應盡的義務了，那就不如自殺了罷！！！是這樣可感的不肯虚度浮生的意志驅使這位有家室有財產的痼疾者走上了自殺這條路！</p>
<p>我是詛咒自殺的。然而對於這位痼疾者的自殺，我却只有感動了！難道我們能夠非議這樣嚴肅的人生態度麽？假使他没有那不可醫的痼疾，那他一定是非常勇敢的生活鬥爭的戰士罷？假使一個民族有那樣嚴肅的人生態度，這民族一定是不可侮的罷？</p>
<p>有這種嚴肅認眞的人生態度的，也不僅是日本民族；我不過隨手舉了一個日本人的例。並且我們也不可以誤會日本帝國主義的蠻橫的武力侵略就和日本人民此種嚴肅的人生態度有什麽因果關係。不是的！那完全是兩件事！但是反過來說，没有此種嚴肅的人生態度的國民却不免要弄成受人侵略而不敢抵抗，常常呼號國恥而只有五分鐘的熱度。我們社會内號稱中堅份子的一般中等階級就是最缺乏那樣嚴肅認眞的人生態度！所以復興閘北災區的資金要用獎劵的方法來募集，所以救濟東北難民要開游藝會，要用電影明星舞女名妓來號召！所以在氷天雪地中對日本帝國主義抵抗的，只有向來被賤視的窮苦老百姓了！</p>
<p>嚴肅認眞，絲毫不肯苟安的人生態度！不能夠堂堂地做一個於社會於人類有用的人，那還不如死了罷！不能夠堂堂地過合理的人的生活，那還不如拼了命罷！這應該是我們的旗幟，我們的信條！</p>
<p>因爲醉生夢死的人即使他不肯「自殺，」遲早要「被殺！」</p>
<h3 id="c226">尊愚論 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>對於愚笨人的福氣，早已爲前人所發見，也有人很加欣羨的，所謂人生識字便是憂患之始的見解，就含有此種傾向了。但在這些話中，還隱藏着自己是高出羣愚的一種虚誇，並未知道愚人的種種美德，也不曾想到愚笨的的確可以尊崇，所以一方面雖然欣羨愚人，而自己仍不甘心去做個愚人，於是這話也就成了泛泛的一句空話。更可笑的是那一輩聰敏自居的人，知道了自己處境的可憐，却還對愚人加一種悲憫的眼光，以滿足他們的優越感而自己麻醉。</p>
<p>愚笨的人是什麽都不曾知道，他固然不管别人的哀憐他或欣羨他，也不知自己的處境和地位如何，他所看得見的，祇有面前的事情。他缺乏深謀遠慮，他没有計劃方案，他祗會做，實事求是的實行。事情是危險的或是没有成功的希望的，他從不加以考慮；他并不曾預想了事情的一定成功，然後去做的，就是他對於成功和失敗並没有什麽關懷，如同東北各地義勇軍的抗日，便是此種愚笨精神的一表現。</p>
<p>稍微聰敏的人，决不會以給養不足器械窳敗的數千人和全日本國的兵力對抗的。非常聰敏的人是决不敢以數十萬的兵力和日兵一較短長的。大智大慧的人，自然非有十分勝算，决不肯輕動了。愚笨的人，根本見不到此，他們的失敗，也是自取之咎，好在他們也並不把一次幾次的失敗當作奇恥大辱，他們的愚笨，使他們續繼去努力這些未了之事。所謂硬幹蠻幹笨幹死幹幹到底，便是愚笨的一貫精神。</p>
<p>愚字往往接着一個頑字，愚而不頑，不成其爲愚，惟其愚到頑不可化，才能有愚笨的眞價値。有科學家　畢生之精力以研究一種寄生蟲的生態，有科學家窮全生涯的歲月去觀測一個星球的運行，有科學家化數十年的心血去發明一個齒輪的運用，打算起來眞太不値得，而愚笨的可貴，也就在這裏。</p>
<p>在我國是太多了聰敏人而太少了愚笨的人，所以祗多了各方面的領袖盟主大師宗家，而缺少信徒與奉行者，其結果造成了領袖與盟主的戰爭，宗家與大師的對敵，一事未成而糾紛百出。</p>
<p>如果這些人，原來是聰敏的，是有領袖盟主的才具的，那也還有話可說，也不算寃枉。可惜在我們中國的這些頭兒腦兒頂兒尖兒，未必全是生性絶頂聰敏，其中反確有不少十分愚魯笨拙，却也裝得像煞有介事，自鳴不凡，結果則笑話百出一場糊塗，那眞有點慘。</p>
<p>要改去這種毛病，惟有提倡尊愚之一法。以前對於愚笨的人，太不敬了，以致大家都想去做起聰敏人來，結果聰敏人太多了，事情弄僵。現在惟有把愚笨的位置提到聰敏之上，希望本來並不聰敏的人，仍舊去做愚笨的工作，而對於那些本來聰敏的人，也希望他們來參加一點愚笨的工作，如是，然後社會各方面可以希望說空話誇大口的領袖人才漸少，實事求是的實行者漸多，再漸漸形成前途的一線曙光。一二·二五</p>

<p>— 海天</p>
<p>有一種新的自然現象，已引起了人們好多年的注意，這就是「宇宙光」。研究牠的許多科學家，還没有一致的意見。不過關於這神秘的光的來源，大家似乎都承認牠是從地球以外來的，不是地球的本身所具有的。至於這光是什麽性質，從什麽地方或什麽方向射來的，是從别的恒星上來的，還是從我們自己的太陽系以内來的，這些問題在目前還須加以若干時的研究。</p>
<p>宇宙光比Ｘ光還要强，Ｘ光所穿不過的厚鉛板，宇宙光穿得過去。牠還能深入湖中。科學家曾經把最精密的儀器，放入湖中，攝取這種宇宙光，要到很深的湖底才攝不到。深水能夠阻擋宇宙光的進路，人們因此推想到包圍地球四周的濃厚的空氣層，一定也相當的吸收牠。愈高入天空，則宇宙光也應該愈强。</p>
<p>今年夏間，比國科學家畢卡德敎授，乘氣球昇入五萬三千六百呎的同溫層中，希望測得比在空氣層下面的地球面更强的宇宙光。但出乎他和别的許多科學家的意料之外的，是並没有覺到增强，反而似乎减少了一些。畢卡德認爲空氣是光的媒介，從太陽上來的光和熱，必須經過空氣的媒介，才能發光熱。在眞空中，光熱是不生作用的。因此宇宙光在高空中比地球面來得少些。</p>
<p>宇宙光有什麽用處，現在還不知道。幾千年前的古代人，用琥珀摩擦出小火星，不料這就是現代文明的電。我們知道宇宙光的性質之後，牠也許會比電更有用些。</p>
<h3 id="c228">蘇州印象記 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 振甫</p>
<p>（一）三生花草夢蘇州</p>
<p>「蘇州」這兩個字，縈繞於我的腦海中，已經很久很久了。這是怎樣可愛的一個名詞啊！怎樣使人戀慕的一個名詞啊！我們想到這兩個字，同時使我們立刻聯想到姑蘇臺上的西字，橫塘水畔的圓圓，觀前街是怎樣的風華，天平山是怎樣的奇峭；在歷史上有他的旋旋的風光，在名詞上更有使人戀慕的夢想。俗語說：「上有天堂，下有蘇杭，」我們倘僅就他光明的一面看，這或許是可信的吧？</p>
<p>記得我小時候，有一次和父親同乘在一隻内河的小輪船上，船上的搭客有一位蘇州老太太，雖然時光老人很無情的剝奪了她少年的風光在，她的額上刻着深深的一條條時代斧鑿的皺紋，然而可驚異的動人的使人戀慕的特微，依舊保持在這位年老的太太的身上。當她談話的時候，一種柔媚而迂徐，具着特殊風格的蘇州人的聲調，依舊保持着。當我第一次聽見她談話的時候，我是怎樣帶着驚奇的喜悅，去聽這種可愛的，似音樂一般可愛的聲調呢？這是我第一次聽到的蘇州人的談話。到隔了十多年的現在，使我還不能忘記，她的魔力是怎樣的偉大啊！這不是我一個人的虚誇，「吳儂軟語」不是社會上所公認的嗎？</p>
<p>沅是我最親密的同學，他正是「阿儂生小住蘇州」，當然更使我傾倒了。自從我和沅有了深切的交情，使我對蘇州人有了人格上的認識，更增加我對於蘇州的戀慕了。有一次我送給沅的詩中，有兩句是「一種柔情傳　水，三生綺夢到蘇州」，上一句是繫念着我家鄉的朋友，下一句就是指沅了。後來看到龔定盦的詩，内中有幾首是對於一位蘇州女子的戀詞，雖然他是隱隱約約不肯明白說出來。其中有一句是「三生花草夢蘇州」，和我的詩句，不約而同；也可見蘇州確有使人戀慕的所在，不是我一個人的夢囈了。以下就是追述我這一次遊蘇的淡薄的印象。</p>
<p>（二）古蹟蒼凉弔虎丘</p>
<p>「愛而不見，搔首躊躇」的蘇州，現在居然因了沅的引導去游覽了，這是多麽使人快慰的事！當我們從學校裡告了假出來的時候，天是怎樣陰雲鬱結，但我們心頭的微笑，並不因而受打擊；我們並不怕天會降雨來阻止我們的遊興，卽使天眞個不雨，我們冒雨而游，也别有一種旁人不願領略的風趣，我們抱着這種心理，所以很快慰的前進了。從無錫乘了下午的火車，到了蘇州車站，下了車，再沿鐵道到虎丘去。</p>
<p>在路上：不甚寬闊的街道，舊式的房屋，牆壁上塗着打倒某某的兒童的作品，也和故鄉不甚相遠；不，也和各地的情狀差不多，不過有幾處的祠堂和幾個石牌坊，表示着這是地靈人傑的所在。這是蘇州城外的情形，還保存着中國式的本來面目，而未被摩豋化的現象。當黃色的牆壁和金色輝煌的虎邱禪寺的題額，耀入眼簾時，我們的目的地已經到了。我們走進了寺門，兩邊有不少的樹木，已帶着一些蕭瑟的意境，表示已是深秋的時候了。在荒烟蔓草之中，有纍纍的墳墓，有孤立的凉亭，有殘碑斷碣，我們倘從歷史上去探討，也許其中含着許多可歎可泣的情事，但是我們僅僅爲了賞心悅目而來的遊客，自然無暇去替他考證了。左邊有一個新建的亭，竪立着石碑，記着一個張孝子因救母而遭焚斃的一段事實，有蘇州名人的碑銘，這位張孝子是一個貧苦的江北人，是被人所輕視的江北人，而居然能在這名勝的虎丘佔一席地，受人崇拜，孝子地下有知，也可以自　了。（未完）</p>

<p>「胡說！没有一點規矩！幸得林廖兩先生不是别人。」</p>
<p>「老婆和奴隸不是Snonym喲！廖先生！對不對？」</p>
<p>曹夫人伸了伸她的頸項，把頭一歪，做了半個鬼臉，向那一邊去了。曹海泉便想，這眞是一位摩登女子。</p>
<p>到後來，還是因爲革命尙未成功，女性到底是女性。曹夫人終于給曹世光屈服了。一個人到禮拜堂來的，還是一個人由禮拜堂回去。</p>
<p>望着老婆的孤寂的後影消失了後，曹世光像完全没神經地翻轉頭來向着林廖兩個人說。</p>
<p>「我們走吧。」</p>
<p>「但是我八點鐘不得空。」</p>
<p>海泉忙先申明。</p>
<p>「没有什麽要緊的事吧。我們今晚上痛快地頑頑不好麽？」</p>
<p>「八點鐘有了約，失信不得。」</p>
<p>「不要緊。」</p>
<p>「怎麽你們宗敎界也不顧信用呀？」</p>
<p>「還不是掛掛招牌而已。」</p>
<p>曹世光的態度是頗天眞率直，只有廖海峯一人默默地不說話。</p>
<p>「我雖然没有領洗禮。但我不能不守信用。」</p>
<p>海泉笑着說。</p>
<p>「林先生的話是對的。」</p>
<p>廖先生也微笑了。</p>
<p>「那麽，先到飯館子裏去再說。還有一點半的時辰，怕來不及麽？」</p>
<p>從敎會出來到Ｋ路的Ｓ菜館的電車費，算是由曹世光一手付出去了。在館子裏呌了兩塊錢的和菜。本來大家都有點餓了，吃飯就好了的。曹世光還嚷着要喝老酒，結果便來了半斤的遠年花彫。讓他一個人自斟自酌起來。</p>
<p>過了一會，飯菜也吃完了。茶房揑了三條熱烘烘的手巾送前來。</p>
<p>「老曹，那件事先讓我打一個電話去問問看」。</p>
<p>廖先生，接了手巾，揩了揩嘴巴，便走出去了。曹世光捧着熱手巾，揩了一回臉，再很細心地揩他的雙掌。那條雪白的毛巾上已經染上一塊黑跡了。</p>
<p>「老林，請坐一下，我去解一個小手就來」。</p>
<p>他却朝裏面走了。</p>

<p>— 質</p>
<p>我們爲什麽要讀書，做官嗎？發財嗎？不錯的，我們底父母大槪都想我們在學校裏畢業出去！高小畢業抵秀才，中學畢業抵舉人，大學畢業抵翰林，一切都如前清科舉時代一般，向官中去尋黃金屋。但我們，年少志堅的我們，决不在這惡念頭中翻筋斗的。不過，在現社會中一般人以爲做官是求生活安適的最好捷徑。人類旣然是趨樂避苦的，人類旣然是向勞少而安適多的方面走的，做官旣然是件一本萬利的事，你呌人們不傾向，怎樣可能？你看張三本是在一小學中當敎員的，每月所入，不過十餘元，仰不足以養父母，俯不足以育妻子，朋友親戚皆以他爲無用之人，輕視他，揶揄他，使他失了生活的樂趣，於是他發憤了，投筆從戎，曾幾何時，他從某軍校畢業出來，到某軍隊裏實地工作，他肩上即掛起小皮帶，腿上也即縛起綁腿，儼然一個可以驕人的軍官了！於是這個喊他營長，那個呌他長官，親戚尊他，朋友敬他，他所學的雖然是肉餵砲的游戲，他所做的雖然是損人不利己的事，但他每月所得黃的是金，白的是銀，從此，父母是老太爺老太太，妻子是太太奶奶了；非但衣食不愁，而且可以從此列入富翁之伍了！這樣，誰不羨慕他呢？你看，李四，他本來是個狡猾的流氓，終日以欺騙爲生活。只因時勢是造英雄的時勢，有英雄的才幹的，自然得入英雄之域，某某萬歲！打倒某某！看！他儼然是個了不得的大人物了！軍隊來了，地方糜爛了，人民屠戳了，社會混亂了，但是他的命運已造成了！於是那位李先生也成爲社會的功臣，他從此可以光宗耀祖，住的是洋房，坐的是汽車，吃的是珍錯，抱的是美妾，這樣神仙的滋味，誰不想去嘗嘗呢？老實說：在這個世界，除升官發財外，還有什麽更好的勾當呢？你要别人向苦多樂少的學問道上走，只有瘋子纔能聽你的話呀！</p>
<p>這眞是一切人的感想嗎？不錯的，世上的聰明人大槪都這樣想，但是我們須知道瘋子是使社會的輪軸向前進的原動力，近代社會的進步，都由少數瘋子造出來的。你們想，發明陶器的人，把家中一切傢具，甚至他所睡的床子都燒了，作爲實騐之用，這不是瘋子的行爲麽，發明飛機的人，造出一些玩意兒來，自己坐上去，冒着危險，如鳥般的翱翔於空中，這又不是瘋子的行爲麽？那些研究學問的人終日埋頭於研究室中，自壯年以至老死，所得的不過幾條常人以爲無足輕重的眞理，那裏及得門庭如市，威名赫赫的高官？這自然又是瘋子了！其餘如不顧生命的探險家，革命家，更不用說是瘋子了！諸位！中國退步的原因在那裏？就是瘋子太少，聰明人太多！</p>

<p>聖誕老人也許懂得『處世的哲學』吧：所以每年到了天寒歲幕的聖誕節，他老人家，穿了紅衣，冒着雪，必有許多禮物來送給人們：什麽糖菓啦：糕餅啦：玩具啦：滿滿地負了一大包，僂着背，蹣跚地奔到人間來送禮。外國人在這天聖誕令節，都是非常高興，！！尤其是小孩子，什麽開宴會，慶祝聖誕：在樹上燃了燈燭，宛如火樹銀花一般，十分燦爛悅目，名喚『聖誕樹。』這天吃火鷄，牛肉，呌做『聖肉：』喝葡萄酒呌做『聖血：』唱歌跳舞，度這聖誕之夜，是何等的狂歡啊！我們中國人的冬至，大家吃湯糲，年糕，來討一個彩頭：夜裏還有求夢的迷信，中西的風俗，畢竟不同呢。</p>
<p>我想我們　國人，睡在那一天</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>的夜裏，｜冬至夜｜一定是有夢的。不過夢是各人不同，大多數人一定夢着黃金元寳，向懷裏滾進來。也許有一般人夢着做官，頤指氣使，威風十足，嬌妻美妾，良田華屋，富貴已達到了目的了。有的正夢着大進仇貨，生意興隆，立刻就要發財，忽然來了一顆炸彈，把他的好夢警醒。也許有一般青年，正夢着擁了愛人，海誓山盟，甜蜜非常，忽然來了一個情敵，拔出手槍，錨準他們，耳邊只聞『硼』的一聲，嚇了醒來，原來是南柯一夢。·······</p>
<p>我們貴國人，做過了『冬至幻夢，』接連便是外國冬至，｜耶穌聖誕｜那不識相的聖誕老人，又要送禮物來了。聖誕老人的禮物是甚麽呢？旣不是糖菓，也不是玩物，又不是×××團的無情炸彈，實是一顆熱熱的良心。聖誕老人因爲我們貴國人，缺乏了這個東西；所以不把國家放在心上，不管國家亡不亡，只知道拼命買仇貨，進仇貨，鬧意氣，自家火迸：所以不送别的東西，只送這顆熱烈的良心了。不知道我們貴國同胞，喜歡接受嗎？</p>
<p>唉！聖誕老人吓！你爲什麽把東三省送給日本人當作禮物呀？我們接受了你的良心禮物，還要向他們手裏奪回這件禮物咧，大家快快起來吧！</p>

<p>後來他經友人的介紹，得識了在××洋行服務的某甲，更由某甲的介紹，潘君在××洋行謀得了一個小行員的職位，某甲在這洋行的職位很高，一切華職員幾乎都在他管理之下。當時潘君進這洋行服務，由經理（西人）訂定月薪三十五兩，但某甲自以爲提拔有功，竟在潘君月薪項下，每月扣除二十元，作爲介紹的報酬，同時更令潘君不得將此秘密洩漏，潘君因畏其勢，亦敢怒而不敢言，某甲見潘君可欺，乃將最繁忙之工作，交給潘君，每天早晨八點起到晚上七點才放他回家，藉此在外人面前獻功，以誇自己推薦得人，</p>
<p>某甲精於生財之道，非但剝削下級職員以自肥，他在業餘，更創辦了一個以賺錢爲目的的夜校，每晚請潘君到他的夜校裏去襄助敎授，每學期僅貼潘君車費五元，這簡直替他盡義務，因爲每日有二小時敎授工作而每月只有八角錢報酬丨潘君畏其勢，亦只有隱忍以聽受他的剝削而已！</p>
<p>潘君每日担受十四小時的繁劇工作，像牛馬一般地操作，而潘君勞動的報酬又被某甲剝削殆盡，於是一個奮發有爲朝氣蓬勃的青年，磨折得萎頓消沉毫無生氣了！</p>
<p>今年夏我無意中在路上遇着潘君，幾乎使我不信小别半年的老友，竟消瘦得這樣駭人，於是他告訴了我他最近的狀况，我除了嘆息外，也没有辦法，我勸他寗願失業應以身體的保重爲要。但潘君却慘然地說：『我嘗過失業的滋味，也許失業比被剝削的痛苦更深啊！』我們就在這樣無辦法的默然之中，悄然地分别了，現在一别數月忽然從舊同學方面聽到潘君逝世的惡耗，據說致死的病一半是積勞成疾；一半是心中悒鬱所致！</p>
<p>意外的刺激，燃着了我一腔忿火，我終於抑制不了我緊張的情緒，準備爲潘君復仇，但潘君究竟不是某甲用手槍打死的，不能提起法律訴訟，况且潘君已死，他生前所受的委屈，今無佐證，而某甲現在又兼做大律師了。顯然我不能用法律去制裁他，我又思用消極的方法去揭破某甲的隱私以破壞他的名譽，但是手段又太卑鄙了，我不願以人格的喪失爲老友復仇的條件。這樣徬徨了幾月，依舊找不到一個方法爲潘君復仇，聰明的編者先生聰明的讀者，請你們同情這一個寃死的小職員，站在公正的立塲，予我一個適當的解答。</p>
<p>中傑敬上十二月二十一日</p>
<p>編者按：我們讀完了這封悲痛憤怒的信後，不覺五中如焚，與中傑君同樣的對潘君表無限的同情和悲憤，以潘君這樣一個有爲的青年，却在這不良的環境中被無恥，自私的某甲犧牲了！</p>
<p>但我們應當知道：這種事態之發生，是社會制度不良的結果。犧牲在這不良的環境之中的，何止潘君一人；社會上險惡的人，又何止某甲一個。所以我們認爲這是整個的社會問題，當從根本着手，以謀整個的改革。</p>
<p>潘君是犧牲了，已死不能復生！我們覺得爲生者想法，比死者復仇還要急切些；所以我們對於無恥，自私，像某甲這一類的人，應當一致的加以抨擊，不服從，不妥協，爲整個的人羣謀利益，爲整個的社會謀幸福；以大無畏的精神，努力向前途奮鬥；不屈不撓，務使這一種的人類之蠧，在社會上絶跡而後已。</p>
<p>我們於同情悲憤之餘，尙要爲潘君惋惜，而不得不以潘君當時觀念之錯誤，引爲憾事。我們以爲與其委屈求全終朝如犬馬般工作，受無恥自私之人的壓迫以至於死；何如跳出火坑寗願失業與自私自利的無恥之徒奮鬥以死！</p>
<p>我們與潘君報仇的方法，就是促進社會制度的改革，使某甲這種人無存身之餘地。至對於某甲個人的處置，雖然因「事無佐證」而不能提起法律訴訟；然對於他的劣跡，何妨公之大衆。旣消了胸中惡氣；又可使接近他的人，不再受他的愚弄。這種義俠的舉動，如何可算得「卑鄙」？如何會「喪失人格」？</p>
<p>嫉惡如仇的情緒，使我們說了上面一大套；但我們再平心靜氣下來，研究研究潘君致死的原因。</p>
<p>根據來信，潘君是因了「積勞成疾」及「悒心中鬱」而死的。這種原因，社會上最是普遍。解救的方法也有兩個：㈠是遇事樂觀：無論工作何等的繁忙，環境何等的困苦，總以樂觀態度處之。㈡是注重體育；關於這一點我們在本月二十四日的本欄「跑進商店後身體壞了」一文裏，已經約略說過，讀者可以參閱。我們以爲這兩點果能實行，則心中自不至悒鬱，積勞亦不會成疾了。</p>
<p>讀者諸君：讀了上述的事實，有如何感想否？對於某甲這種人，有更好的處置方法否？社會制度的改革，有具體方案否？希望大家研究，發抒偉見。</p>

<h3 id="c237">「蠻女天堂」的瑣話 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 白</p>
<p>｜BirdofParadise</p>
<p>你要說這篇文字是頌揚「蠻女天堂」，我切實地承認：「蠻女天堂」的確有很多値得頌揚的功績和事實。</p>
<p>㈠物質的犧牲</p>
<p>在本年正二月間，從一本美國電影業的報告上讀到一段消息，大略說：美國雷電華影片公司導演金維多先生和女明星桃樂絲德里奥ＤoloresDelRio女士，率領三位攝影師，到夏威夷去訪取「蠻女天堂」的背景。在夏威夷，他們寄居在皇家旅社二個多月，回到美國，獻出他們的成績品是一百多張風景照。雖說是夏威夷的山水之秀盡在此中，然而這背景試騐的代價丨一切旅費和底片是五十餘萬元。</p>
<p>不停的耗費，不絶的浪擲，考究，逼眞，黃金國不斷的匯欵到夏威夷。在影片完功之後，雷電華公司的統計是：全片耗費了二百三十餘萬元美金，時間是九個月，一切都超過預算。最大的原因是守着偉大的幾勞埃亞Ｋilauea火山的爆發，而攝取山崩，火噴，地裂，海嘯的眞景。四個月便在這般無所事之中守候着，希望着。</p>
<p>照雷電華公司和桃樂絲訂的合同，她有全權支配在夏威夷攝片時的一切費用。在完成之後的結算時，發現了桃樂絲已化費了預算一倍以上的金錢雷電華公司因爲這一點的不滿，於是取消了桃樂絲繼續任用的合同。</p>
<p>㈡著作者的悽遇</p>
<p>「蠻女天堂」的作者李却華爾登德雷ＲichareWaltanTully因爲這部戲本，曾有家破人亡的慘遇。所以在叙述李却先生爲「蠻女天堂」而遭遇的不幸之先，講些他一生的慘史。</p>
<p>李却在十三歲時，水災破了他父親的資產，經濟上受了打擊，李却就當了一個戲院販賣員。他把工資所入，作爲攻錯之資。高中卒業之後，决意進大學。在加利佛尼亞大學校的二年中，他勤勉學業之外，抽暇編寫該校三年級表演的劇本。從多少劇本中，他竟然膺了首選而排演。在觀衆中，有一位傅弼漢斯夫人，她知道了這少年李却的苦刻奮鬭，於是她資助費用，使他能從大學畢業。李却於圖書館參考的時候，引起了他對於夏威夷土人的興趣：這就是他寫「蠻女天堂」劇本的動機。</p>
<p>當「蠻女天堂」出演之後，紐約和英國，都連演了二年。一霎那間，李却已成民紐約的富者之一。然而舛運終久没有離了他，突然被人控訴，誣他抄襲。經過六年的纏訟，方始在一九三○年三月十八日，由紐約上訴法院判决，李却勝訴。</p>
<p>訴訟，是勝了：可是，他已一貧如洗。同時，他的夫人，因爲離婚了。他，此時祇剩得一紙劇本，滿腔酸辛，兩袖清風！</p>
<p>雷電華影片公司購買「蠻女天堂」的電影攝演權，當然是他絶地逢生的事。這五十五歲的老者丨李却丨在人亡家破的慘遇下的見到「蠻女天堂」展演於銀幕之上，也許在滿面淚容中，會現露一絲慘笑吧！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c238">「魔愛」Ｓvengali的評 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>（本事）有一個年老而神秘的音樂師，和三個畫家，住在比隣。畫家常常戲弄這樂師，但他並不爲忤。有一天，樂師在畫家的屋中，遇見了一位女郎，他認爲這是天才的歌唱家，十分賞識。但是那女郎和畫家中最年輕的一個一見如故，愛苗突生。樂師不惜殫精竭慮，用催眠術攝女郎而去。數年之後，樂師與女之歌唱，相得益彰，名負一時。畫家追踪而至。有一天，樂師方在奏藝，因爲精神耗盡，體力不支，所以死在舞臺上。惟女郎本性已不能恢復，故畫師之來，終未能償其宿願。</p>
<p>這一個劇本，所注重的，就在一魔字，所以所用的鏡頭和光綫，都充份帶足了「神秘」和「偉大」：更有不少地方。把平常的事，染上恐怖的色彩，眞是出人頭地。導演也當有思想力，自始至終，都没有落俗的地方，只抓住了一個「魔」字來描寫。背景很美。佈景也深深顯示着「古色古香」和「神秘」。</p>
<p>約翰巴里穆ＪohnＢarrymore飾樂師，是唯一的主角。在化裝術和服飾上已經是値得贊許的了。表演的嚴肅穩重，特别是神幻的目光，眞不可多得。瑪琳曼許ＭarianＭarsh是他很和的助手。本性和被迷以後，兩種不同的表情，反寫出樂師的苦心，非常的好。配角如飾青年畫師的費勒却爾ＢramwellＦletcher也極稱職，餘下的人，雖然表演很少，但是成績都不錯。個個人都有「古典」式的色彩。</p>
<p>這一長華　的出品，眞是一　來卡爾登所映的最好一張。</p>
<p>意見一斑</p>
<h3 id="c239">㈠門票減價問題 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 玉侖</p>
<p>本埠頭等的戲院，除光陸國泰外，其樓下座價，只收大洋六角，此之數年前起碼一元的時候，已覺平民化得多了。這是要感謝南京大戲院的。在牠未開幕前，那時影院，像奥迪安，卡爾登，夏令配克等，都是開映初次片的，白天最低座價都尙是一元，自從南京開了收六角的例，於是各影院都紛紛减價。其後大光明新光開幕，亦收六角。花六角錢看頭次開映之片，似乎很便宜，没有再减的可能。其實不對的，還可减些。香港便是一個好例子。</p>
<p>香港的娛樂，皇后，中央，等大戲院，都是裝飾輝煌，開演初次片的戲院，娛樂大戲院並且有冷熱氣管的但，牠們的座價，娛樂是五十仙，中央也一樣，皇后只有三十五仙。</p>
<p>照上面理由，南京等票價還可再低，因爲票價减則片租亦可滅，戲院是不會大吃虧的。但是也許有困難；因爲票價减，中階級中人也會到頭等戲院去看戲，次等戲院營業會受打擊了。而且頭等院的秩序，也不會太整齊了吧。</p>
<h3 id="c240">㈡避免毁謗式的批評 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>「是中國片，没有一看的價値呵」！這論調是一般愛好影片的觀衆，選擇影片時一個普遍的估計。是無根據的帶有毁謗性的批判，無形中國產片中了深深的暗傷！不消說，這即爲國片不倡的多方面中底主要一方面。</p>
<p>藝術是和社會現象一樣，逐日在進化着的。看！尙居青年時代的國片，又在蓬勃的活躍了。我們應用自我的全力救愛護及培植她呵。要常觀國片，多給她忠實的批評：導演演員尤須盡量接納觀衆的批評。如是相互推動着，國片在藝術的發展上最能突飛猛進的！</p>
<p>觀衆對於國片宜先領略而後始下批評：若僅是漫無根據的估計，易使國片中傷！喜愛電影的人們，要避免毁謗式的批評。</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>
<h3 id="c241">化裝的運動 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 紅</p>
<p>我們曉得現代的電影，能夠運用其奇特的鏡頭，攝生各種各樣奇特的人物，但是，我們要曉得這各種各樣奇特的人物，是非有神妙的化裝，無以爲功的。</p>
<p>化裝在黃金國的好來塢，固然是早已獲得成功，可是，我們中國的電影演員們，對於此道，却知之甚鮮，當然更談不上研究了，所以，我們現在特地提出這個問題來喚起中國的電影演員們注意！</p>
<p>中國的電影明星們，切不要以爲你們已懂得，老頭子應該用×號的油彩×號的粉，少年人和漂嫩的女人應該用·····，這些皮相，就自己爲滿足了。你們還應該懂得：要怎樣去掩盡你們臉部的疵瘰，均匀你們臉部的色澤，使其有利於攝影。</p>
<p>可是我們中國的電影明星們，對於化裝這一武器，却没有緊緊地把握住，我們試舉一個例，如當今最紅的女明星丨胡蝶女士，無論她扮的是那一種角色，我們總還在同一的兩個笑渦上面，認得她是一個胡蝶！</p>
<p>我們再看看好萊塢一個已故的男明星，郎却乃的成功，而且是他留下在電影史上的無限光榮，全然是由於他的曉得利用這一神妙的化裝的武器。</p>
<p>因此，我勸告中國的電影演員們在未上鏡頭之前，在化裝的時候，須先詳細地審察，劇中人所應具有的特點：同時也要注意及全劇上塲的幾個人間的色調之調和。然後動手，掩揚修飾，使其無過無不及，神而化之。那你在銀幕上的成功，便可以得到一半的把握了。</p>
<p>臨了，願我們中國電影明星們，聰敏地去利用這一武器丨化裝。</p>
<p>影業調查</p>
<h3 id="c242">關於聯華第三廠 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 紅</p>
<p>｜製片公司訪問記之九</p>
<p>聯華影業製片公司的創立大有握住中國影業的牛耳，也可以說是中國影業的托辣斯化，它的勢力範圍，從中國好萊塢的上海，擴張到北平，香港；因此，聯華便於去年春間在香港設立第三製片廠，并開辦一個電影人材養成所：由電影界的老前輩黎北海氏主持其事，然後搜羅省，港方面的電影專門人材如梁少坡，關文清等帮助辦理，經過了一個相當的籌備時間之後，便實行其製片工作了。</p>
<p>聯華第三廠的處女作是採名劇家梁少坡氏編的「鐵骨蘭心」，由石友于和溤潔貞合演，歸關文清氏導演。這部戲在滬上公映已久，地方色彩很濃厚，全然是廣東的風味呢。</p>
<p>第二部出品爲「古寺鵑聲」，是羅明佑氏自己編的劇本，由梁少坡氏導演，主角則由薛兆榮和唐醒圖擔任，已於去年年底攝竣了。同樣的也是一部廣東人的戲。</p>
<p>至於第三部的製作，劇本雖已選定黎北海氏編的「賢母」，却未實現，收入鏡頭的工作，而在這世界經濟恐慌，商業不景氣中，聯華第三廠已於無形中停頓了。</p>
<p>但，此後是否能繼續製片的工作，現在尙未敢說定呢。</p>
<p>影塲談屑</p>
<h3 id="c243">林楚楚和宣景琳 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 湯神</p>
<p>中國影壇裏有二個女星，她們倆面孔都不漂亮，而又同具悲哀個性的：一是黎民偉的太太，林楚楚，一是號稱小老太婆的宣景琳。</p>
<p>宣景琳在銀幕上的歷史也許比林楚楚長：可是她的收穫遠没有林楚楚那麽多！</p>
<p>誰個亮晶晶的女星不羨慕虚榮，自己願意放棄自己的青春美，而去飾一個小老太婆？但，林楚楚却不在乎此，她寗願在銀幕上裝一個頭髻，穿一件陳舊的衣服。着一件紥脚的褲子，她的衣服，最少離開時代有半世紀之上；觀衆還記得那别了丈夫，賣了兒子，死了翁姑的鄕下賢德的媳婦吧！我可說看過人道的没有一個的不久印在心裏的。還有故都春夢裏的棄婦，續故都春夢的一個飽經患難的母親，雖然是人間極頂的悲哀材料，我也可說没有她悽婉的表情，也不能表達出。</p>
<p>宣景琳的個性和身分，似和林楚楚没有二樣，但她所扮的却不同了。前一年，還在天一公司飾女學生飾歌女，無疑的這是違背了她天賦的一付臉嘴，個性；所以她的成績不能美滿。</p>
<p>現在她是脫離銀幕的生活，又聽說她又要來了；我們熱誠地希望她能自己認識自己，不要再蹈覆轍。</p>

<p>以前九種表情獨習法因爲要使學者養成一種對自己表情能移自覺的習慣，所以是用深呼吸的漸進漸退法練習的。</p>
<p>現在我們要更進一步，用聲音的力量來帮助我們的表情。原來表情大别爲兩種。第一種是姿態表情，是由視覺去感動人的。第二種是聲音表情，是由聽覺去感動人的。我們已經練習過的，僅僅是姿態表情中最重要的部分而已。目前因爲篇幅所限，我們不得不把聲音表情的力量顯示出一部分來。</p>
<p>這是表情獨習法第十式。大致和前面詳細討論的第二式相髣髴。不過這是不用深呼吸而用聲音來增加表情的力量就是了。</p>
<p>學者仍依前法對鏡中自己影兒的眉心中間注視，然後由鼻管中深深吸進一口氣。在吸氣的時候，眼光漸漸變成憤怒。</p>

<p>Garrison Troops in Liaodong All Transferred to Western Liaoning</p>
<p>Domen Ordered to Gather Remaining Troops and Return Home</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram arrived from Kailu late on the 25th, stating that Japanese troops in Tongliao are still increasing, but there are no significant activities yet. According to investigations, the Japanese army still intends to use Mongolian bandits as a vanguard to harass Kailu, with the puppet army of Zhang Hai-peng in the middle and the Japanese army in the rear. Our Liu Guitang's troops have moved from Gaoliju to the front lines. Regarding the Japanese plan to attack Rehe, although it is divided into Kailu and Chaoyang routes, the troops are mainly concentrated along the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line. The Japanese are publicly claiming an imminent general offensive on Kailu, but the main battle will actually be in Chaoyang. (26th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Eight Japanese tanks left Goubangzi on the 25th for Kailu, Tongliao and other places to assist the Japanese infantry fighting against Feng Zhanhai. There have been fierce battles between the Japanese army and the volunteer army in Tongliao, Bayan Qinghemen for several days. Feng's cavalry has bypassed Tongliao county town and raided Mulilu. Local militias have risen up to assist. (26th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Southern Ridge of Rehe and Chaoyang are guarded by the Zhao Jiqing Brigade of the Self-Defense Army. The area from Yixian to Beipiao is defended by the "Cattle and Horse Society," a people's organization which is extremely brave. Kailu and Lingnan are defended by a Special Operations Unit organized by the Public Security Bureau Chief, with substantial strength. (26th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Jinzhou transmitted by the Japanese News Agency claimed that the border between Jinxi and Rehe Province is under intense war clouds. Wang Lin telegraphed Ping saying that external rumors are not credible. If the enemy attacks, he is determined to resist to the end. (26th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese aircraft have been flying to the border of Rehe every day for reconnaissance, but there have been no conflicts with the defense forces. Public opinion generally believes that there will be no serious developments at present. (26th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Changchun) Commander Domen of the Second Division visited Commander Mutō today. Due to more than a year of fighting, many soldiers were wounded and killed, and morale is low. The recent losses in the Triangle Zone were huge. He has now been ordered to gather the remaining troops and return home. Today he bid farewell to Commander Mutō and is scheduled to meet with Commander Sakamoto of the Sixth Division in Shenyang on the 28th to discuss handover matters. He is scheduled to lead the remaining troops through Korea back to Japan at the end of the month. (26th, China United Press)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed villages in Beipiao, Qinghemen and other places. Residents are indignant and have risen up to join the National Salvation Army in resisting the enemy. (26th, China United Press)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Recently, there was news that a division was being added to Rehe's border defense.

<p>Refuting Japanese Sophistry</p>
<p>(Geneva) Our representative Gu Weijun today sent another memorandum to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, refuting Japanese sophistry. It is divided into four chapters, with the following main points: ㈠ Chairman Chiang's anti-communist work has been very difficult due to the impact of Japanese aggression, but it has finally been successful today. ㈡ The so-called Sino-Russian Secret Alliance of 1896 is no longer in effect. ㈢ During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan refused China's request to participate and demanded China's neutrality. Subsequently, at the suggestion of former US President Roosevelt, Manchuria was returned to China, as clearly stipulated in the Treaty of Portsmouth. Japan's credibility was greatly diminished by this battle. ㈣ Japan's claims that Commander-in-Chief Chiang requested Japanese troops to stay in Jinan in 1927 and that Japan advised Zhang Xueliang not to obey Nanjing were both initiated by Zhang himself, are absolutely unfounded fabrications.

<p>Zhang Ji Oversees the Oath, Lin Sen Confers the Seal</p>
<p>Promoting the Three Principles of the People and Clarifying Education</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhangjia took office as the Mongolian Banner Pacification Commissioner at the National Government at dawn on the 26th. Chairman Lin conferred the seal, and Zhang Ji was sent by the Central Government to oversee the oath. Guests included Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian, He Yingqin, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shuren, Shi Qingyang, Shi Ying, and representatives from various departments and committees, numbering several hundred people. Zhangjia wore an ochre-colored robe, a dark yellow mandarin jacket, and black satin shoes. After the ceremony, Zhang Ji delivered instructions on behalf of the Central Government, stating that he had discussed the relationship between China and Tibet with both the Panchen Lama and Zhangjia, dating back to the Tang Dynasty when two princesses were married off. The founder of the Red Sect was also a legacy of a princess's marriage. In the Ming Dynasty, the Yellow Sect (Zhangjia's hometown) was first built in Suining, Gansu. Today's two major sects are both a glorious part of our country's history. It is hoped that they will unite sincerely and work hard on psychological construction. Zhangjia has had many achievements in the past, and it is hoped that he will work even harder in the future. Chairman Lin then delivered instructions, stating that the Central Government and the government have great hopes for Zhangjia's appointment as the Pacification Commissioner and that it is a prelude to sincere unity and solving the national crisis. Now that Zhangjia is asked to pacify the Mongolian banners, the relationship between the Central Government and the Mongolian banners will become increasingly close. Next, Zhangjia delivered a reply, the original text of which is as follows: Zhangjia has been in charge of Mongolian religious affairs for generations. At a time when the country is in great difficulty, he is unable to contribute to the times and feels deeply ashamed. The Central Government cares for the border people and has specially ordered him to pacify them. The great plans and kindness are admired by all. I have already taken office and sworn an oath today, listening respectfully to the instructions. I will do my best to uphold the Central Government's intention to pacify the border regions and comfort the border people, promote the Three Principles of the People, enlighten loyalty and sincerity, and ensure that we unite sincerely and resist foreign aggression with one heart. I will choose a date to travel to Mongolia to promote the Central Government's virtue and intentions, and with the determination of my Buddha to save all beings, I will clarify education and promote the Three Jewels so that the loyal and patriotic Mongolians will strengthen their loyalty and that the brutal and stubborn enemy will have no means to use their tricks. I will promote the spirit of unity among the five races and make a firm effort to fight to the end. I respectfully accept the good words and will absolutely follow them. After the speech, Zhangjia shook hands with the dignitaries, took photos at the second gate, and the meeting adjourned. (26th, Central News Agency)</p>

Because after the army was mobilized, the area of five villages in Fenghuang bordering Guizhou was also greatly affected by the Guizhou bandits, who burned and looted villages, it was reported daily. It was also the period when my unit was training the second phase of the teaching brigade. Due to the terrain being more open in the five villages, I concentrated the teaching brigade in Yalaying and Fenghuangying and stationed the first regiment of the first brigade in Daxingchang, Tongren Prefecture, and the second and third regiments in Panshiyingzhengying, still conducting field exercises to search for and suppress bandits in the area. They have not entered Tongsong. At a time when the national crisis is urgent and diplomacy is pressing, the issues in Shandong and Sichuan have already given others an excuse.

<p>The Japanese army has again launched a large-scale incursion into Rehe in recent days. The front lines have already reached Chaoyang Temple, with repeated engagements with our volunteer armies led by Zhu Jiqing, Wang Yunping, Meng Zhaoyan, Li Haifeng, Ma Zidan, and others. The defenses of North China are in grave danger. Consequently, the generals of North China have proposed reopening the North China Security Conference, intending to jointly discuss strategies for resisting aggression and defending territory, based on the principles decided at the previous Political Committee meeting. Only now that the fire is singeing our eyebrows do we discuss defending our territory. Has the deep slumber finally ended? Although, what's past is prologue, if we are willing to mend the fence after the sheep are lost, then such a conference is certainly worthy of our attention.</p>

Therefore, having obtained the Northeast, further inclusion of Rehe and Chahar is inevitable. After the fall of Jinzhou this January, the Japanese army once pressed towards the Rehe border. However, due to the rise of volunteer armies and insufficient troop allocation, the situation eased. In July, using the Ishimoto Incident as a pretext, they launched a full-scale offensive. Our volunteer armies fought fiercely, and the situation on the Rehe border tightened sharply. Since then, the situation has fluctuated, and Rehe Province, isolated beyond the Great Wall, has been in constant danger. Had it not been for the restraints imposed by the various volunteer armies, it would likely have become a continuation of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang long ago. Now that Ma Zhanshan's troops have retreated to a corner, and the tens of thousands of soldiers of Su Bingwen's National Salvation Army have suffered a crushing defeat, while other volunteer armies, such as Feng Zhanhai's, are gradually becoming unsustainable due to lack of support and ammunition, the Japanese army has fewer concerns. Thus, Rehe is inevitably becoming more perilous. Alas, the Japanese have long been determined to seize Rehe, and for over a year, the military authorities in North China have not been heard to have made any plans to resolutely defend this isolated city in its twilight, instead watching the various northeastern volunteer armies, empty-handed and fighting with flesh and blood, being defeated one by one by the enemy, allowing them to safely advance and encroach on Rehe. Only now do we have agreements on "North China Security," which feels late.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our expectations for the North China Security Conference are quite earnest. Rehe is the shield of North China. If Rehe falls, North China will be in imminent danger. The generals of North China, from Zhang Xueliang downwards, all possess substantial military forces. Learning from the past mistake of non-resistance, how should they now exert all their efforts to actively aid Rehe, ensuring that the province does not become a continuation of the three northeastern provinces? This is the first point. The danger of Yuguan has long been shared with the enemy. Now that the Japanese army is encroaching on Rehe, to restrain our reinforcements, they will inevitably use force in the Yuguan area simultaneously. How will the North China armies resolutely defend their territory, shedding the blood of their soldiers to protect this strategic pass? This is the second point. Our country's soldiers have long been viewed with animosity by the people. However, why do the people despise soldiers? If they can fulfill their duty to defend the country, the people will provide food and drink, and treat them like parents. The enthusiastic support of the people for the northeastern volunteer armies and the 19th Route Army is an example of this. Therefore, those who have humiliated the country and lost territory in the past, if they wish to avoid the condemnation of the people, must today make a firm determination to die and prepare for a heroic sacrifice. This is the right time. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are things that we must tell our citizens. The Northeast has been lost for over a year. The danger in Rehe did not begin today. We have repeatedly stated that the people of the country should actively support the northeastern volunteer armies, preventing the enemy's iron hooves from quickly trampling across the three northeastern provinces and into Rehe. Today, Rehe is once again in imminent danger. The outcome of the North China Security Conference, in terms of military preparations, is another matter. However, our need to intensify our support for the volunteer armies to restrain the enemy cannot be delayed any further. The volunteer armies are the true military force of our people. If the volunteer armies are not preserved, Rehe will not be protected. If Rehe is not protected, North China will soon be lost to us. A prairie fire spreads a thousand miles in a day, and will soon reach us. Citizens of the country, the situation is urgent. If you do not want to seek survival today, then so be it. Otherwise, at this critical juncture of life and death, you should ignite the passion of all our people and engage in a final life-or-death struggle with the strong enemy before us.</p>

<p>Dai Chuanxian's Report at the National Government Memorial Week</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week at 10 AM on the 26th, attended by Chairman Lin, He Yingqin, Zhangjia, Zhang Ji, Yu Youren, Chen Gongbo, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, and staff from the civil service, military, and accounting departments, totaling approximately 400 people. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and Dai Chuanxian reported on "The Spiritual Achievement of the Third Plenary Session," stating that the Third Plenary Session was held the previous week after the Central Government and the National Government returned to Nanjing. The situation was very good, unprecedented in previous sessions. Simultaneously, the Second Internal Affairs Conference was also held, and the situation at the meeting was also good. During the Internal Affairs Conference, important officials from various provinces and cities came to participate, and religious and political leaders from Mongolia and Tibet also participated in the conference. This indicates the unity and solidarity of our party. At the same time, in the response of the solidarity of our party, the hearts of the people of the whole country are also united. This is a manifestation of the whole party and the whole country uniting to save the country. Although the Third Plenary Session had fewer proposals and resolutions than usual, its significance and impact can be said to be more significant than past plenary sessions. Sun Yat-sen said, "The country is an accumulation of people, and people are instruments of the heart." It can be seen that the accumulation of people relies on the heart to act. Now that the whole country and the whole party are united, everyone has a new awareness in their hearts and infinite courage for the future of the country. Although there are still several places engaged in pacification, they will soon be quelled. To resist strong enemies and recover lost territories, we must also complete our work in unity and solidarity. It is hoped that there will be a new upswing and new actions in the future. We must continue to complete unfinished work, unite sincerely, and strive forward, so that we can achieve the task of saving and building the country. It is hoped that the government and the people will uniformly accept the spiritual unity and spiritual success of the Third Plenary Session, and realize it in fact, so that the spiritual achievements of the plenary session can evolve into factual achievements.

<p>Moscow TASS News Agency, 25th - Today's editorial in the "Pravda" summarizes the success of the Five-Year Plan, stating that the Soviet Union's international standing has greatly increased, and the dream of military intervention in the Soviet Union by the great powers will be buried forever. It also states that the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia shows that the Chinese people's sympathy for the Soviet Union and its policies has greatly increased. The newspaper first mentions the non-aggression treaties signed by the Soviet Union with various countries and the recent resumption of diplomatic relations with China, calling it a victory for Soviet peaceful policies. At the same time, it points out the increasing conflicts between capitalist countries, such as the collapse of the Versailles system, the destruction of the Washington Treaty, and the League of Nations' inability to resolve the Manchurian issue, which has become a tool for imperialism. It says, "In this situation, the Soviet Union has not only not become the target of military intervention, but has also strengthened its international standing. This is all due to the Soviet government's peaceful policies, which have completed the Five-Year Plan in four years, as well as the development of industry and the strengthening of national defense." Discussing the Soviet Union's international relations, it says that the resumption of Sino-Soviet relations is a result of the Chinese people's sympathy for Soviet policies. However, the Soviet Union's resumption of relations with China does not hinder its relations with Japan, even though Japan has begun an anti-Soviet movement as a result of this. The Soviet Union only maintains a peaceful policy towards all countries, including Japan and other countries. At the same time, the Soviet Union's ability to defend its borders has been fully strengthened. "All dreams of military intervention in the Soviet Union will be buried forever."</p>
<h3 id="e69">Rapidly Reforming Agricultural Plan <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>US-Russia Diplomatic Relations May Not Be Far Off</p>
<p>Berlin National News Agency, 24th - Today, reliable sources here have learned that Stalin will announce a rapidly reforming agricultural plan on January 5th, which will abolish the grain requisition system. In its Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union overly emphasized industry, sacrificing agriculture as a result. Not only are farmers resentful, but most are also lazy in their work. As a result, there is a shortage of food, and the people are showing signs of hunger. Opposition to Stalin's policies within the country is growing daily. Therefore, there is this large-scale reform plan, which will be presented and passed at a special meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee on January 5th. It is said that Stalin will give an important speech at that time. After the grain requisition system is completely abolished, it will be replaced by a tax system, which will levy taxes based on the number of acres cultivated. However, taxes will be paid in goods instead of currency.</p>
<p>Washington National News Agency, 24th - US Senator Nye commented on the news that Soviet Russia will drastically change its economic policies, saying that this change will increase the chances of the United States recognizing Soviet Russia. After Soviet Russia implements the rumored plan, its trend will end the dumping of grain and other products in the United States and other countries, which will indirectly benefit American farmers, and thus improve the American attitude towards Russia. Representative Rayner said that Soviet Russia's abolition of the grain requisition system may be said to be a partial restoration of capitalism, but it is not the collapse of communism. It seems that Soviet Russia is about to implement Stalin's declaration that workers must be given better compensation, because their abilities and activities deserve such compensation. The general opinion in Congress is that Soviet Russia has decided to end its plan of not recognizing existing realities and will provide some encouragement to those who produce the country's food.</p>

<p>Mountains of Important Bills Piling Up</p>
<p>The Seiyukai Party Plans to Overthrow the Cabinet</p>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 26th. The 64th Diet session opened this morning at 11:00 AM in the presence of the Emperor. The Emperor, dressed in the uniform of a Grand Marshal, left the palace at 10:30 AM and arrived at the House of Peers at 10:45 AM. The Emperor delivered a speech, expressing his pleasure at the close friendship between Japan and the treaty nations. The ceremony concluded, and the Emperor returned to the palace at 11:25 AM.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 26th. The Japanese Diet held its opening ceremony in the Upper House today. As social tensions intensify, the number of police officers inside the Diet was increased to 300, all carrying firearms and under martial law. Their headquarters is located in Toranomon. The Metropolitan Police Department has also formed a "Shinsengumi" unit comprised of political police and highly skilled patrol officers, stationed at the Metropolitan Police Department, ready to deploy at any time at the request of the Diet to prevent riots by both left and right-wing groups.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 26th. The topics to be debated at this Diet session can be divided into: (1) Financial and economic issues: (i) Budget deficits and remedies, (ii) Public debt consolidation methods and market maintenance, (iii) Administrative and tax system reforms, (iv) Permanent sources of revenue for increased taxes and military expenditures, (v) Shortening the duration of agricultural relief, (vi) Issues related to exchange control and maintaining exchange rates, (vii) Rising prices and the livelihoods of workers and farmers; (2) Diplomatic issues: (i) Measures regarding the League of Nations, (ii) Measures following the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, (iii) Increasing troops in the Three Eastern Provinces (Manchuria) and maintaining security, (iv) Economic control between Japan and Manchukuo and trade between Japan and Manchukuo; (3) Ideological measures: (i) Responsibility of communist judicial officials, (ii) Measures against the expansion of communist influence; (4) Rural issues: (i) The Rice Law and anti-Japanese sentiment among the colonial population, (ii) Fertilizer measures and farmers' purchasing power, (iii) Silkworm egg and raw silk management, (iv) Farmers' debt consolidation; (5) Commerce and industry measures: (i) Iron and steel mill merger and unification, (ii) Store law and conflicts of interest with capitalists. Other issues, such as railway policy, have already become tools for the Seiyukai Party to overthrow the cabinet. Important matters such as amendments to the pension law, election law, railway official bribery case, and sugar factory tax evasion cases are piling up like mountains. Moreover, the various factions have differing approaches to the government, making the Saito cabinet feel particularly thorny.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 25th. The number of seats held by each party in the new Diet is as follows: Seiyukai 299, Minseito 117, Nationalist faction 33, Independent faction 10.</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, 26th. The Seiyukai Party has finalized its Diet strategy. Because public opinion and elder statesmen do not favor a political upheaval, directly clashing with the government by rejecting the budget is undesirable, as the core of the budget lies in military expenditures, which would inevitably face opposition from the military faction. While overthrowing the cabinet is desired, it might not achieve its intended goals. However, if only slight modifications are made to the budget, it is feared that a direct conflict cannot be instigated. It is said that the Seiyukai Party's strategy has been decided to focus on the railway accounting within the special account, as railway policy has historically been a tool for the Seiyukai to entice voters during elections. This could potentially garner sympathy from the electorate, and even lead to the ouster of Railway Minister Mitsuchi. If Mitsuchi were to be ousted, it would be sufficient to cause Finance Minister Takahashi to resign, thereby causing the Saito cabinet to collapse on its own. It is said that the radical faction is using this case to recruit comrades, and more than two hundred people have already signed up. The two major meetings of the radical faction are scheduled to be held tonight at the Nakagawa Sake House in Akasaka to discuss steps to overthrow the cabinet.</p>

<p>Losses of 40 Million Pesetas</p>
<p>8,000 People Lose Their Jobs as a Result</p>
<p>Havas, Barcelona, Spain, 25th. A major fire broke out yesterday at Siglo, the largest department store here. Firefighters fought the blaze for three hours before it was contained. The cause of the fire is believed to be sparks emitted from electrical toys displayed in the street-facing windows, which ignited other items. Part of the store's building, constructed in 1881, was almost completely destroyed. The storefront also collapsed this afternoon. The balconies of buildings across the street collapsed due to the vibrations, blocking doorways and preventing residents from exiting. When the fire initially broke out, neighboring buildings were evacuated, so no one was injured. The fire damage is estimated to be around 40 million pesetas, which is higher than the amount of fire insurance previously secured with British and domestic companies. Furthermore, over 8,000 people have lost their jobs as a result of the store being burned down. Today, the President of the Catalan Provincial Government and local officials visited the scene of the disaster to survey the damage. Firefighters are still extinguishing the remaining embers, and a large sum of money remains unretrieved from the store's cellar safe.</p>

<p>Hopes to Become Future Secretary of State</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 25th. Today, the "Qingyi Bao" published a message titled "Norman Davis as Liaison Between Hoover and Roosevelt," stating that while the transition between the old and new American presidents has not yet taken place, diplomatic relations cannot be completely suspended, and the new government should prepare to assume responsibilities. Therefore, Norman Davis is acting as a liaison between the two presidents. On one hand, Davis is President Hoover's special representative for disarmament and economic issues, and on the other hand, he has a close relationship with Roosevelt. He is even referred to as the future Secretary of State by some. He is well-suited to communicate between the old and new presidents. Whether Davis joins the government or not, he will ultimately work for Roosevelt to handle diplomatic issues. Davis had a long conversation with Hoover on Friday and will begin visiting Roosevelt next week. The discussions will likely be about preparations for the World Economic Conference. Roosevelt is extremely concerned about this matter and repeatedly spoke about it during his election campaign, stating that the tariff issue should be included in the agenda of the upcoming World Economic Conference, implying that if European countries can reduce tariffs, the United States could reduce war debts in exchange.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Inspection Report on the Recovery of Various Areas After Suppressing the Communists (7) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Inspection of the Communist Nest in Honghu</p>
<p>(Taxation System) The taxes levied by the communist bandits in Honghu are divided into land tax, business tax, customs duty, and rent. A brief description is given below: (i) Land tax: This tax is collected based on the yield of the fields and the social class of the farmers, calculated annually, and collected in spring and autumn. The tax rate starts at 100 yuan. Rich peasants pay 15 percent of 100 yuan, middle peasants pay 5 percent, poor peasants pay 3 percent, and so on. (ii) Business tax: This tax is levied progressively. Capital between 50 yuan and 200 yuan is taxed at 2 percent, 200 yuan to 300 yuan at 2.5 percent, 300 yuan to 400 yuan at 3 percent, 400 yuan to 500 yuan at 3.5 percent, 500 yuan to 600 yuan at 4 percent, 600 yuan to 800 yuan at 4.5 percent, 800 yuan to 1,000 yuan at 5 percent, and the rest are increased according to the rate. (iii) Customs duty: The Honghu communist bandits set up checkpoints at lake entrances and major roads to collect import and export customs duties. For both exports and imports, they collect 1 percent starting at 50 yuan. Merchants from non-red areas passing through the red areas with capital above 5,000 yuan are required to pay customs duties based on the progressive business tax rate. To alleviate the food shortages in the red areas, the communist bandits exempt import food from customs duties to encourage rice merchants to transport food regularly. (iv) Rent: Houses confiscated by the communist bandits in the bandit areas are distributed to poor and middle peasants living in the countryside along with the land. In major cities and towns, except for those reserved for use by various agencies, the remaining houses are rented out by the "Soviet" at market prices. For privately rented houses, land and property taxes are also levied on the landlords. The above are the communist bandits' regular taxes. Later, due to insufficient income, they concocted various pretexts, creating donations to support the Red Army, exploiting every source of revenue, and imposing exorbitant taxes, making it increasingly difficult for the people in the bandit areas to make a living.</p>
<p>(Red Education) The Honghu communist bandits paid unusual attention to red education, organizing a "Cultural Committee" to specialize in this matter, doing their best to instill communism, and anesthetizing the general ignorant population. Their education methods are divided into two types: social education and national education. Social education is centered on workers' and peasants' clubs, setting up reading rooms, reading classes, lecture halls, and new drama stages to instill communism at all times. In addition, they use various assembly methods to carry out the social education of their red masses. For national education, they set up Lenin Elementary Schools to redify young children and establish night schools or half-day schools to instill communist knowledge in the general uneducated population. Their various plans are extremely meticulous.</p>
<p>(External Transportation) To supplement their material needs, the Honghu communist bandits secretly maintained external transportation. Xindi is their main port of entry and exit, where daily necessities such as rice, grain, and salt are mostly obtained. Personnel dispatched from Shanghai to the bandit areas and the transportation of various machines land at Bailuoji, west of Xindi. The communist bandits pre-dispatch ships to meet them there. Those traveling from Shanghai purchase tickets to Shashi, transfer to bandit ships at Bailuoji midway, and head to the Honghu bandit area. The bandit ships all have secret signals, much like the situation in Liangshan Marsh. As for the bandit area's external trade, merchants handle it from the middle. Merchants traveling back and forth have passes issued by the communist bandits and good citizen certificates issued by government troops as protective charms. When a merchant arrives in the bandit area, they present their pass to pass through. After leaving the bandit area, they hide the pass and present their good citizen certificate to prove their identity in order to avoid danger, forming a subtle commercial relationship. With the above-mentioned unbelievable secret transportation methods, even though government troops were besieging them, the communist bandits' external transportation was still not completely cut off. This is the reason.</p>
<p>(Internal Strife) The Honghu communist bandits have complex internal factions and differing opinions. In addition to the ultra-left communist bandits, there are reorganization factions, the Third Party, the AB Corps, etc. Before the bandit nest was captured, the reorganization faction, the Third Party, and the AB Corps united to overthrow the ultra-left faction, scheduled to launch an uprising on September 15. However, the plan was leaked, and the ultra-left faction preemptively struck. Starting from September 13, they began the so-called anti-rebellion work, arresting more than 1,000 people they considered to be reactionaries. Countless important personnel in the communist bandit party, government, and military were implicated and imprisoned. People were panicking and felt uneasy. When arresting the reactionaries, all the arrested important personnel were smeared with black ash or covered with black cloth, and escorted at night to avoid attention. One or two days before the bandit nest was broken, most of the arrested personnel were executed. In the Xingu area, 700 people were killed in one night. The massacre was so tragic that it made one's hair stand on end. As a result of the communist bandit infighting, the interior was in turmoil, morale was scattered, and the National Army took the opportunity to attack, destroying them with the force of a thunderbolt, and sweeping away the nest in no time.</p>
<p>(Occupy the Mountains or Occupy the Water) During the National Army's suppression, as the Honghu communist bandits' nest was threatened, a fierce dispute arose internally regarding the safety issue. One faction advocated occupying the mountains, believing that occupying the mountains was easy to defend, and strongly advocated abandoning Honghu and fleeing to the mountains of western Hubei or western Hunan. The other faction advocated occupying the water, believing that Honghu was located in central Hubei, with a strategic location, making it easy to develop and retreat, and that it would be enough to confront the National Army. Moreover, it had been operated for several years, and abandoning it would be a pity. The two factions argued inconclusively. In the end, the mountain occupation faction gained the upper hand. He Long selected more than 2,000 elite troops to seek another way out to the west. Wang Yimin and others led the bandit troops to guard Honghu. The "Soviet of the Western Hunan and Hubei Province" moved from Qujiawan to Xingouzu. The main force of the bandit troops was also concentrated here. Later, the 10th Army of Xu Yuanquan launched a large-scale siege of Xingu, wiping them out in one fell swoop. The remnants of the Honghu bandits were quickly cleared within a few days. He Long fled west when his nest was broken.</p>
<p>(Reasons for Failure) The Honghu communist bandits had a great momentum, but they were annihilated in one fell swoop this time. The reasons for their failure are approximately as follows: (i) The officers and soldiers of the Tenth Army, who suppressed the Honghu communist bandits, were exceptionally brave, their plans were meticulous, and their advance was rapid. The communist bandits were a rabble, poorly trained. Once they encountered a strong enemy, they could not take care of both ends. In the Battle of Xingu, the entire army was wiped out. (ii) The communist bandits initially used the abolition of exorbitant taxes, the equal distribution of land, and the relief of the people's suffering to lure the ignorant villagers. As a result, exorbitant taxes were abolished in name but still existed in reality, and the equal distribution of land was nominal rather than real. In addition, the struggle against rich peasants made the farmers uneasy, and arbitrary killings made everyone feel insecure. The suffering of the people in the bandit area was a hundred times worse than before the redification. Although the people dared to be angry under the accumulated power, they did not dare to speak, but the people's hearts were alienated, they realized the fraud, and thought of returning on their own. (iii) Mutual infighting and self-destruction of the barrier. The internal united front was broken, and the National Army's suppression attack became easier. (iv) The defense and attack strategy was inconclusive. The overall plan for defense against the National Army's advance was not completed, and the National Army suddenly advanced, responding in a panic, and the flags were overturned and the tracks were chaotic. Due to these various reasons, the Honghu, which the communist bandits had operated for several years, was recovered, and the elite troops that had gathered for many years were also wiped out at once.

<h3 id="e81">Chen Guohui is Executed <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Fujian Pacification Headquarters Announces Chen's Crimes</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Chen Guohui, the brigade commander of the mixed brigade of the Fujian Provincial Defense Army, who was previously detained by the Pacification Headquarters, was sentenced to death on the morning of the 23rd at 7:00 AM and taken to the parade ground inside the Donghu Barracks for execution by firing squad. He was killed by a total of five shots. This reporter personally went to observe and saw Chen's body lying supine on the ground, wearing a gray serge suit, blue socks, and slippers. His head was shattered, his chest and abdomen were riddled with holes, his hair was an inch long, and blood flowed all over the ground, a truly tragic sight. It was learned that Chen's execution this time was unknown to all parties beforehand. The public only learned of it after the announcement of his crimes. It is said that the reason for this was that Chen's former subordinates Chen Peiyu and Chen Yucai, etc., recently colluded with local bandits such as Ye Wenliang, Lin Qinglong, Ye Dingguo, and Quan Feifeng in Nan'an, Anxi, Dehua, and Jinjiang counties in southern Fujian, causing large-scale disturbances, attempting to disrupt local security, divide military-civilian relations, and thereby undermine the overall situation. A few days ago, Cai Tingkai returned from the province to Zhangzhou to inspect the situation in various places and telegraphed Jiang Guangnai to execute Chen in order to prevent such people from blackmailing and then dispatch troops to search and suppress the bandits in order to eliminate the bandit disaster. Therefore, after receiving the telegram, Jiang executed Chen by firing squad. The Pacification Headquarters' announcement of Chen's crimes is recorded as follows: "It has been determined that Chen Guohui was originally a reckless and unbridled individual, who took advantage of opportunities to gather in southern Fujian, acting violently and committing all kinds of evil, such as protecting bandits, extorting money, harming the people, imposing exorbitant taxes, creating taxes at will, forcing the cultivation of opium poppies, slaughtering and burning villages, destroying party affairs, and resisting orders with his troops. His various crimes are too numerous to count, and they are all facts that are commonly seen and heard in society, with no possibility of concealment. When our army moved into Fujian, we received complaints from overseas and domestic mass organizations and victims accusing Chen of causing disasters in Fujian, which were piled up a foot high. The head of this army still repeatedly tolerated and exhorted him, hoping that he would repent and reform. Unexpectedly, the criminal persisted in his evil ways, poisoning the local area and resisting orders with his troops as before. Therefore, we took him into custody and presented a report to the Military Affairs Commission of the National Government requesting the organization of a military tribunal. After careful investigation, the evidence was conclusive, and his crimes were unforgivable. The criminal Chen Guohui should be sentenced to death in accordance with Articles 25, 27, 35, 47, and 63 of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law and the crimes combined. He will be taken to the execution ground on the 23rd of this month to verify his identity and be executed by firing squad as a warning. This is hereby announced, including the execution by firing squad of the bandit Chen Guohui, a native of Nan'an County, Fujian Province, 35 years old." (December 23)</p>

Huang sent his representative Huang Yishou to the province on the 18th to contact Luo Wang and other wealthy merchants to proceed with the establishment and find a location to build the bank's address in order to open as soon as possible. The bank's capital has now been raised to one million yuan.

<h3 id="e83">Investigation of Fisheries in Qinzhou, Guangdong <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Externally Restricted by the French, Internally Oppressed by Heavy Taxes</p>
<p>Fishermen Adhere to Old Methods, Fisheries Are Declining Daily</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Qinzhou in Guangdong is close to the southern frontier, facing the Gulf of Tonkin. In the past, marine products were abundant. However, recently, due to the lack of new methods for harvesting fish and the shortage of capital, large-scale fishing operations are impossible. Furthermore, local fishermen are burdened by heavy taxes, hindering their development. Even if they venture far offshore, they are restricted by the French territorial waters, controlled by foreigners. Therefore, in recent years, Qinzhou's fisheries have been declining daily, leading to increasingly difficult lives for fishermen. The Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction, in order to promote the local fisheries, recently sent specialists to investigate, to design a plan to revitalize the industry. The latest findings are as follows: ㈠ The location and depth of Qinzhou fishing port: The fishing port is commonly known as Yuchun Port, also called Longmen Port, located in Qinzhou Port, spanning Fangcheng, Qisha, and other places, including Longmen Port, Ganzhou, and the construction of "Daughter Trench."</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Banditry in Jiangxi Province is gradually being suppressed. To prevent the resurgence of the "Red Peril," the Ganzhou authorities have added trenches outside the city for defense. They have also ordered all men and women in the city between the ages of sixteen and fifty to work on the project. Officials from various agencies, teachers, faculty, and students from various schools must also form special teams to participate in the work for two weeks. Since the news spread, there has been no issue with the men. However, the women who are accustomed to pampering, especially educated female students, deeply worried about the heavy tasks. Principal Tan of the Provincial Second Girls' Middle School believed that this action related to bandit prevention and should not be delayed. Yesterday, she discussed with the school's physical education department and decided to lead over a hundred faculty, staff, students, and school workers with hoes and other farming tools to the designated location for trench construction. Although the delicate female students felt extremely tired, their spirits were high, forgetting their hardships. The county's various sectors praised the move. In the future, after the trench is completed, it will be called "Daughter Trench," so that the elegant name of "Lady City" will no longer be unique (Shen Shi News Agency).</p>
<p>Sanlian Bay, West Ring, Butterfly Ridge, Longmen Port has a depth of four to ten fathoms, the bottom being rocky, rich in oysters. Sanlian Bay has a depth between four and six fathoms, the bottom being a mixture of sand and stone, yielding few fish. West Ring has a depth of five to eight fathoms, and Butterfly Ridge has a depth of six to nine fathoms, where fish are becoming scarce. ㈡ Fishery production and fishing boats: Longmen Bay produces oysters; Sanlian Bay, West Ring, and Butterfly Ridge produce red fish, sardinella, dried fish, goby fish, and shrimp. There are about one hundred and fifty to three hundred large and small fishing boats distributed in the above three areas. ㈢ Fishing season and quantity: The fishing season is in the four months of August, September, October, and November. Spring is the off-season, and April, May, June, and July are rest days. Large fishing boats catch about 35,000 catties per season per pair of boats. However, the number of large fishing boats in the entire port is less than twenty. Medium-sized boats catch about 26,000 catties per season per pair of boats. Small fishing boats are more numerous than medium-sized boats, with each small boat catching about 5,000 to 6,000 catties per season. Longmen Port produces about 40,000 catties of oysters annually. ㈣ Fish trade and price: The fish caught by fishermen are concentrated in the fish markets in Beihai Port. The fish markets pay according to market prices and specialize in wholesale. Ordinary fish varieties cost about nine to ten yuan per hundred catties. Oysters cost eighty yuan per hundred catties, and eels cost one hundred and twenty yuan per hundred catties. ㈤ Heavy customs duties: Every fishing boat entering the port through the Beihai Customs must pay a tax of one hundred yuan, or they will be detained. Fishermen have no way to complain. ㈥ The issue of fishing in the sea: As soon as the large and small fishing boats sail to Dongxing Fangcheng for fishing, they are often unreasonably arrested by the Vietnamese French authorities, who consider it to be fishing across the border, and the fines are very harsh. If they cannot pay, the fishing boats will be confiscated, and the fishermen will be imprisoned. Therefore, fishermen now hope that the government will delineate the territorial waters as soon as possible, establish water boundaries, and maintain our territorial sea rights. ㈦ Fishermen's livelihood: Qinzhou fishermen live a very hard life. Recently, due to the increasing cost of living, expensive fishing gear, heavy internal tax burden, and external constraints by the French, they work hard all year round but can only barely make ends meet, with no profit to speak of. If they cannot cope, they will inevitably sell their children and boats to pay off debts. This kind of situation is common throughout the year. (December 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Ge Guangting Talks About the Recent Situation of the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Short Revenue in July, August, and September, Gradually Better After October</p>
<p>Construction of Boshan Branch Line Still Stalled</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway, accompanied Shen Honglie from Qingdao to Ji yesterday. That night, he sent Shen and Han Fuqu to Beiping. Ge stayed in Jinan due to business and is scheduled to return to Qingdao tonight (24th). I visited Ge and inquired about the railway's business situation this year. Ge said that the railway's operating revenue was originally budgeted at 17.3 million yuan for the 21st year. However, the business was poor in July, August, and September (due to the flooding in Boshan, various mines were flooded, and the sales of coal were hindered by Japanese coal), resulting in a major impact. Revenue was only 700,000 yuan in July, 800,000 yuan in August, and 900,000 yuan in September. It was not until October that there was a slight improvement. November revenue was 1.5 million yuan. It is estimated that 15 million yuan can still be collected by next June. During the business decline this summer, tightening measures were implemented. Orders were issued to suspend promotions and salary increases (about 110,000 yuan per year). The road administration's public car expenses (about 30,000 yuan per year) were also cancelled, and subsidies for Jiaotong University interns (8,000 yuan per year) were stopped to maintain operations. Now that revenue is better, it is planned to restore everything to its original state from January next year. Because railways are a business, tightening measures are implemented when revenue is low, and expansion is carried out when revenue is high. The minimum requirement is to match revenue and expenses without surplus. It must not be allowed to accumulate debt and lose money. The coal transport from Zichuan and Boshan has now recovered partially. The issue of purchasing the Boshan light railway to build a branch line of this railway is still stalled. The Japanese debt interest is 2.4 million yuan. The first half's 1.2 million yuan has been paid, and the second half's 1.2 million yuan can also be paid off by the end of this month. Preparations for redeeming the railway are currently underway. The railway owes 40 million yuan in Japanese debt. Although the railway has not been redeemed in ten years, the assets have been increasing continuously, now reaching 30 million yuan, which is better than other railways. (December 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e86">Songjiang People Request Exemption from Converting Cropland to Paddy Field <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance is handling the case of converting cropland to paddy field. Due to the lack of understanding of the actual situation of the cropland and closed-door policy making, there are many obstacles. Therefore, the old Songjiang-affiliated counties of Fengxian, Jinshan, etc., find it difficult to implement, and it has been shelved until now. Only the former Finance Bureau of Songjiang County is eager to claim credit and seriously implemented it. However, in the past levies, the landowners believed that the cropland was of poor quality and cheap, and the taxes levied had exceeded 2% of the market value of the land. They could not bear any more burden. Therefore, this grain tribute actually remains in the hands of the clerks and the land guarantors. This is because the landowners are unable to pay. Currently, local people believe that the provincial authorities may not understand the actual situation and have been misled by the county bureau. They have appointed Li Kan and others as representatives to go to Beijing and the province to explain the differences between cropland and paddy field: ㈠ Difference in soil quality: The paddy field in Songjiang is in the hinterland and of better quality, while the cropland, except for a few scattered areas, has different characteristics or can be increased appropriately. The rest are all coastal, so the soil is mostly sandy and contains salt, which is not suitable for planting. ㈡ Difference in terrain: The terrain of Songjiang is high in the south and low in the north. The paddy fields are all in the north, so water is easily irrigated and planting is light. The cropland is all in the south, so water is difficult to irrigate and planting is heavy. Farmers raise an ox, and the strength of the ox is equal. In the cropland, only ten acres can be planted, while in the paddy field, dozens of acres can be planted. Some do not even need the ox's power and replace it with manual labor. ㈢ Difference in area: During the land survey in the Qing Dynasty, the paddy field was six bow (unit of measurement), and the cropland was five bow. Therefore, the area of the paddy field is large, and the area of the cropland is small. ㈣ Difference in rent: The paddy field is from 1.2 to 1.4 dou per mu, while the cropland is all below 1 shi, even only 3 or 4 dou. On average, it is no more than 6 dou. ㈤ Difference in planting: The paddy field is planted with rice, while the cropland can only be planted with cotton, or only with miscellaneous grains or sweet potatoes and other cheap things. Even if rice is planted reluctantly, the yield is very different (in an average year, the paddy field can harvest more than 2 shi of rice per mu, while the cropland only harvests about 1 shi per mu, and some do not even reach 1 shi). ㈥ Difference in value: People buy and sell land based on the rent amount, not based on mu. The same mu can be sold for 1 shi in the paddy field, while in the cropland it can only be sold for 3, 5, or 7 or 8 dou. Moreover, the paddy field in Pubei is more expensive, while the cropland in Punan is cheaper. The government's reorganization of land tax should be a whole plan, not piecemeal, which leads to many disturbances. Songjiang County is currently ordered to conduct a land survey. It seems that the conversion of cropland to paddy field should be temporarily suspended until the land survey is completed, a unified overview of the situation can be had, the land tax can be averaged to ensure fairness and convenience of implementation. It is hoped that the county bureau will be ordered to temporarily suspend the conversion of cropland to paddy field. At the same time, the deadline for the land survey should be limited, and the coastal cropland should be processed ahead of schedule to clarify the situation. It is believed that the provincial authorities will cherish the people's livelihood and will be happy to accept this.</p>

<p>The sixth administrative meeting of the county was held in the county government today (26th). Magistrate Shen presided over the discussions: ㈠ Magistrate Shen submitted a directive from the Department of Construction, stating that the seawall project is important, but the central government cannot bear the expenses, and the provincial treasury is even more incapable. The provincial government ordered that the relevant counties should raise the funds locally to achieve the effect of official-civilian cooperation. Regarding how to raise funds for the seawall project, it was resolved to request the province to allocate funds from half of the road construction funds allocated to the province, and to jointly request the counties of Shangbao and Tai to jointly present the request. ㈠ Magistrate Shen submitted a case regarding the collection of security donations in this county to offset security expenses, which has been approved by the provincial government. However, the implementation of collection is quite complicated. Regarding how to handle it, it was resolved to approve the principle and be handled by the county in conjunction with the Security Committee. ㈠ Regarding the allowances and training expenses for temporary security trainers, etc., the discussion was merged. It was resolved that the district should temporarily advance the funds before the security expenses are collected. ㈠ Regarding the 3,000 yuan for the security training class in this county, which was previously borrowed from the Bureau of Finance and Property, how should it be repaid? It was resolved that the bureau should order the treasury to temporarily advance the funds and collect them from the 21st land price tax.</p>

<p>Replenishing the Navy is Not Easy to Achieve</p>
<p>The Fuhai Incident Has Been Explained</p>
<p>Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan arrived in Shanghai by night train from Nanjing yesterday morning and immediately changed to a car and went to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on Jiaer Ye Ai Road. After talking for about 20 minutes, he went to visit President Song at Qiqi Road and returned to the Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochang Temple at 11 o'clock to rest. Central News Agency reporters visited Minister Chen at the Jiangnan Shipyard yesterday afternoon to inquire about his opinions on replenishing the Navy and the shooting incident on the Fuhai patrol ship. According to Minister Chen, the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee discussed the issue of replenishing the Navy. However, the situation of the Navy is different from that of the Army and Air Force. The Army can recruit soldiers today and form a division tomorrow, and the Air Force can raise 1 million yuan and purchase dozens of aircraft. As for replenishing the Navy, it is not as easy as the Army and Air Force. The cost of warships and submarines is hundreds of thousands of yuan for each small ship, and millions to tens of millions of yuan for each large ship. It is not enough to have three or five ships. At a time when the national treasury is not well off, where can such a large sum of money come from to replenish the Navy? Therefore, although the Navy Department has long had a plan to expand the Navy, it is constrained by economics and cannot be realized. Although the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee discussed the case of replenishing the Navy, it is likely that the reality will not be as easy to achieve as the ideal. The shooting incident on the Fuhai patrol ship of the Jiangzhe Fisheries Administration was due to a misunderstanding and has now been explained. The Ministry of Industry has agreed to allocate the cost of the ship owed to the Jiangnan Shipyard. The Navy Department's Hai Ning ship was originally scheduled to go to Songkou for a test run today (yesterday), but due to bad weather, it has been postponed to the 30th. The Hai Ning ship's test firing results were very good and has now been stationed in Fuzhou. There are warships stationed and patrolling along the Yangtze River, so the water surface is quite calm.</p>

<p>First District Party Branch: Telegram to Chairman Tang of Rehe: "To Chairman Tang of Rehe, respected sir, Japanese soldiers are tyrannical and ravaging the Northeast. Relying on the patriotic army, with their flesh and blood, they bravely fight, emerging from the icy and snowy land, engaging in close combat with them. The people of the country are pained by the loss of territory, honing their will and focusing their efforts on providing spiritual and material assistance from behind. For a year, what has been shown to the world is by no means insignificant. However, the Japanese invaders' ambitions are insatiable, and they are once again invading Rehe, flaunting their military power and insulting us with their invincibility. We grind our teeth and our eyes are tearing, filled with sorrow and indignation. The loss of the Northeast in a short time has been etched in the hearts of the people of the country, and there is no day when it is forgotten. Rehe is the barrier of the Central Plains, and its importance is self-evident. We urge you to inspire the morale of the troops, personally supervise the three armies, and launch a head-on counterattack, so that the world knows that China has not run out of people and the Japanese invaders are aware of the warning. The survival of the country and the rise and fall of the nation depend on this. The comrades of this district are determined to perish together and wholeheartedly serve as the rear guard against aggression. We respectfully submit this brief message, hoping for your consideration." Respectfully from the First District Party Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party in Shanghai.</p>
<p>General Labor Union: Telegram to Tang Yulin of Rehe: "Most urgent, to arrive immediately, to Chairman Tang Yulin of Rehe, respected sir, The Japanese invaders are rampant, not satisfied with occupying Liaoning and Jilin, and are repeatedly attempting to seize Rehe. Fortunately, Your Excellency is leading brave soldiers, closely guarding and preventing them. Although the enemy is cunning and fierce, they have not succeeded. Your reputation is admired by all. However, news has come that the tyrannical Japanese are mobilizing heavy troops and attempting to invade the border of Rehe, and have repeatedly dispatched aircraft to bomb various places, and the situation is in extreme danger. Rehe province is an important town in North China, and a crucial fortress for border defense. The gains and losses are related to the overall situation. If there is any negligence, then if the lips are lost, the teeth will be cold. Beijing and Tianjin cannot be guaranteed, and the Central Plains will be difficult to secure. We earnestly hope that Your Excellency will quickly mobilize a large army to resist to the death. This association will lay bare our hearts and minds and is willing to be the rearguard. We respectfully send this telegram, hoping for your service to the country, and we are extremely anxious." Respectfully from the Shanghai General Labor Union.</p>

<p>Thirty Crew Members Fortunately Rescued</p>
<p>Total Losses Estimated at 300,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The New Fu Tai vessel, owned by the Shanghai Heping Shipping Company, encountered fog and ran aground outside the Wusong Mouth yesterday morning, sinking. The ship's hull was damaged, and efforts are underway to salvage it. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e108">Circumstances of the Accident <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The New Fu Tai vessel departed from Pukou on the 23rd of this month, carrying 4,000 tons of Zhongxing coal, destined for Ningbo for delivery. At 4:45 AM yesterday, the ship was in the Litongsha waters, located at 122 degrees 10 minutes east longitude and 30 degrees 43 minutes north latitude. At that time, there was heavy fog at sea, and the driver mistakenly entered the navigation route, hitting a submerged reef. The third compartment was severely hit with a large hole.</p>

<p>The Hakone Maru, a European liner of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company, was en route from Hong Kong to Shanghai and passed through the Tongsha waters. After receiving the New Fu Tai vessel's distress signal, it sailed to the site of the accident to assist in the rescue. According to a telegram sent to Shanghai by the Hakone Maru on behalf of the New Fu Tai, not only was the third compartment flooded, but the engine room was also flooded, and the situation was extremely dangerous.</p>

<p>After receiving the news, this reporter went to the company to inquire. According to its manager, Qian Fulin, after receiving the telegram about the accident, the Shanghai office sent a wireless telegram to the ship owner, Kszeminski, to inquire, but has not yet received a reply. What is known at present is that after the ship accident, a Japanese ship and a pilot boat from Tongsha were assisting in the rescue. The ship has gone missing. Fortunately, all thirty crew members and sailors can be rescued.</p>

<p>Passengers Safe, Mail Delivered to Post Office</p>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's flight to Hankou, which took off at 8 AM on the 25th, went missing mid-flight due to heavy fog and lack of visibility. The company immediately dispatched business director Nie Kaiyi and pilot Anderson in an amphibious aircraft to search along the original route. However, after the aircraft took off, the company suddenly received a telegram from Nanjing at around 11 AM stating that the missing aircraft had been found about 30 miles from Nanjing. According to reports, the aircraft has a carrying capacity of 1,200 pounds and can accommodate six people. After the aircraft was discovered at the Nanjing station, a large car was immediately hired to go to the accident site and pick up the mail and passengers to Nanjing. Because the aircraft landed automatically at the time, the passengers and the aircraft were not damaged. This reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited the company's secretary, Li Diezhuang, yesterday. According to him, the matter went well. A telegram has been received from Nanjing reporting safety. The company's Deputy Director Nie and pilot Anderson have also gone to Nanjing and will return to Shanghai within days. Last Saturday's flight from Shanghai to Beijing was also cancelled four times due to poor weather. Therefore, the mail was immediately sent to the post office to be transported to Beijing by train that day.</p>

<p>Huálían News Agency, this station report: Mr. Yan Baowei, the stationed Shanghai representative of the Rehe Anti-Japanese Army of He Minhun, received a report yesterday from Commander Wang Yunping of the 2nd Route Army: "Director Baowei, respected brother, I returned to Ping by long-distance bus last night and hereby report the battle situation at the front in recent days as follows: (1) The Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on Rehe on the 18th, from Sanbaoying to Yixian, after building a 300-mile highway. After receiving the report, our army immediately began preparations. As expected, at dawn on the 18th, the Japanese army, under the command of seven armored vehicles, twelve aircraft, and more than two thousand infantrymen, launched a fierce attack on our Sanbaoyingzi position. Aircraft bombed our rear position (Ben Niu Yingzi). After our army's 2nd Route Army Commander Li Ciru supervised his troops, including Li Haifeng's division, and calmly responded, fighting fiercely for a day and night, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and retreated. In this battle, we captured more than ten carts and more than twenty rifles, and</p>

<p>The 93-year-old Mr. Ma Xiangbo is enthusiastically patriotic, and his passion increases with age. Since the September 18th Incident last year, he has loudly called for awakening patriotic sentiments among fellow countrymen. All those who have heard his speeches have been shocked and inspired. Now, at the invitation of the Northeast Refugee Relief Association, Mr. Ma has agreed to give a speech at 10:20 AM today, which will be broadcast by the Asia-America Company. At that time, there will certainly be poignant remarks, attracting attention from all sectors. It is also heard that the Asia-America Company respects the elder and has sent a broadcasting machine to be installed at his home, to save him the trouble. The transport costs were donated by the company.</p>

(2) On the same day, the Japanese army attacked our Fuxin Guangfuyingzi, the defense area of our 7th Route Army. After I supervised Rong Xiangchao's division and Jia Fuchen's division, they were divided into two routes to block the attack, fighting fiercely for about four hours. Our army's Su regiment outflanked the rear of the Japanese army, cutting off its communications. Seeing that their rear was cut off, the Japanese army was greatly panicked and launched a violent breakout. Our soldiers fought desperately, bathing in blood, and as a result, annihilated more than seventy Japanese soldiers and seized a large amount of supplies and ammunition. After the Japanese army retreated, we examined the corpses of the Japanese soldiers, and more than ten of them were female corpses, which shows that the Japanese warlords are scheming to seize us, and women and children are mobilized. More details will follow. I respectfully wish you peace." Your younger brother, Yunping.</p>

<p>Appealing for Supplies of Weapons, Ammunition, Clothing, and Medicine</p>
<p>Since the fall of the Northeast, the Sino-Korean Allied Army in the Northeast Voluntary Army has bravely fought the enemy in the Liaoxi area, and their hardships have been outstanding. Recently, due to the exhaustion of ammunition, the lack of guns, the thinness of clothing, and the exhaustion of food, a representative has been specially sent to Shanghai with a letter from Li Lingran, the Commander-in-Chief of the army, to report the difficult situation of the war and appeal for assistance. The original letter is recorded as follows: "To the Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe Patriotic Army Relief Association, we respectfully open this letter. The Northeast has fallen, and the great rivers and mountains have fallen into the hands of Japanese invaders. As a result, sincere and strong men have risen up and organized a voluntary army to resist the powerful enemy. Recently, the weather has been cold and freezing, and not only are the soldiers without clothing, but there is also a shortage of weapons and ammunition, and even the small amount of medical expenses for treating injuries cannot be met. It is painful to speak of. We have learned that your association has a passion for saving the country and is doing its best to assist the patriotic army. We earnestly request that you quickly find a way to raise funds to help the anti-Japanese work. If you agree, we will be greatly grateful.

<p>Audit Unit Re-Examines Repair Costs</p>
<p>Captain Guo Wei Has Resigned to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the misunderstanding between the Fuhai patrol frigate of the Fisheries Bureau and the Navy has been resolved peacefully through negotiations between Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo and Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resolution in Beijing: After the incident occurred, Zhou Bingkui, the acting director of the Fisheries Bureau, immediately telegraphed Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing for a decision. Chen believed that although the matter concerned the repair costs of the Fuhai patrol frigate, it was essentially a matter between the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of the Navy. Therefore, he negotiated with Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan in Beijing. Both agreed that during the national crisis, there should be no more misunderstandings and were willing to reconcile. In addition to the Ministry of Industry compensating the Jiangnan Shipyard for the repair costs, the Navy Department decided not to pursue the gunfire incident further.</p>
<p>Review of Repair Costs: According to the Jiangnan Shipyard, the Fuhai frigate owed more than 20,000 taels in repair costs. According to the Fisheries Bureau, the Fuhai frigate owed only 7,000 or 8,000 taels, a significant difference between the two sides. At that time, the Fuhai frigate was entrusted to the Jiangnan Shipyard for repairs when Kong Xiangxi was the Minister of Industry and Han Yougang was the Director of the Fisheries Bureau. Several years have passed, making it difficult to verify. Chen Gongbo has now ordered the audit unit of the Ministry of Industry to review the costs. Once the review is completed, the Finance Department will be consulted to transfer the funds to the Navy Department to complete the payment procedures.</p>
<p>Captain Resigns: After this incident occurred, Guo Wei, the captain of the Fuhai frigate, submitted his resignation to the Fisheries Bureau on the 22nd to take responsibility. Zhou Bingkui, the acting director of the Fisheries Bureau, immediately forwarded the resignation to the Minister of Industry for approval. The decision of the Ministry of Industry is still pending.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Repair Process of the Difficult Project on the Northern Jiangsu Canal <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Laisheng'an Breach</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency: Last August, a major flood caused disaster, and dozens of counties on both sides of the Northern Jiangsu Canal became ponds. The eastern side of the canal suffered the most severe damage. Therefore, the canal's dikes are purely for protecting the eastern bank. The purpose of setting up the western dike is to protect the eastern dike so that the waters of the Baoying, Gaoyou, and Shaobo lakes do not directly impact the eastern dike. The eastern dike is the protection of dozens of counties downstream. Last year, there were twenty-seven breaches in the eastern dike. It was difficult to close and repair the breaches. Among them, the Laisheng'an breach, ten miles north of Shaobo Town, was the most troublesome. After the breach was closed, there were two more collapses and one external slope slippage. Many contractors and technicians were imprisoned. The Jiangsu Provincial Government also sold Han Guojun, the director of the Northern Jiangsu Canal Project Rehabilitation Committee, to compensate for the repairs. After Xu Ji, the section chief and technician of the Department of Construction, surveyed it, he designed to separate the silt with stone tanks, and it was completed the day before yesterday. On the 23rd, a Xinsheng News Agency reporter, along with Zhang Junsheng, a technician from the Department of Construction, Wang Zizun, the director of the Jiangdu section of the Northern Jiangsu Canal Engineering Bureau, and technician Mao Feng, went north from Yangzhou along the canal to inspect this famous Huai project and asked about the evolution of the canal management funds. The following is a record:</p>
<p>(Zhaoguan Dam and Its Breach) The reporter and others went north from Shaobo and first arrived at Zhaoguan Dam. The dam is more than forty zhang long. Last year, the question of opening the dam caused a major dispute. This place was originally one of the Guihai Dams. After the dam was opened in the nineteenth year of Daoguang in the Qing Dynasty, it took more than four years and countless expenses, and many people died before it was completed. Because the place had previously breached, the bottom of the dam was very deep, and the foundation was not strong. After the repair, the Jiangsu governor奏准was approved to never open the dam. During the flood, the people in Yunxi demanded the opening of the dam, surrounding the directors of the Canal Engineering Bureau, Zhang Jian and Han Guojun, in Gaoyou. At that time, the Jiangsu provincial officials were also persuaded by the theory of Guihai. After Zhang Han went to Yundong for investigation, they believed that it was impossible to open it and insisted on not allowing it. It was the same last year. Later, a breach of more than thirty zhang in length occurred north of Zhaoguan Dam. When closing and repairing the breach, the main engineer had proposed to dig up the dam to hold clear silt, because the embankment slope contained silt, but black soil was found at the base of the slope. (Black soil is silt that contains moisture and has no adhesion, making it difficult to bond with other soil and rock.) Technician Xu believed that the amount of silt was limited, and since there was already a way out, it might as well increase the embankment and press it out before it was completed. Because the foundation of the Zhaoguan Dam was not solid, it was three feet lower than the embankment. Increasing the height would cause it to sink. This happened repeatedly, and then the stones from the four terraces of the embankment slope were moved to the three terraces before the dam could be balanced. Now it is the same height as the embankment.</p>
<p>(Three Collapses at Laisheng'an) Laisheng'an is ten miles north of Zhaoguan Dam and three miles south of Lujin Town. The breach is thirty-six zhang long. The first time, a construction company contracted to complete it for 60,000 yuan. When it was about to close, it suddenly collapsed again. The contractor was imprisoned in Jiangdu County. The second time was in March of this year. The breach had been repaired. When dismantling the river dams at both ends, the embankment suddenly collapsed again, and the two engineers in charge of the section were also imprisoned in Jiangdu. The third time was in September of this year. The river dams at both ends had been dismantled, and the outer slope had slipped and the top had sunk five feet. The Yangzhou office of the Canal Engineering Rehabilitation Committee drafted three kinds of remedies, with costs of more than 60,000 yuan for type A, more than 40,000 yuan for type B, and more than 10,000 yuan for type C. The Jiangsu Provincial Government telegraphed Han Guojun, the director of the association, demanding that he compensate for the repairs. Han agreed to return to his hometown to sell his property to supplement the embankment repairs. Later, Xu Ji, the section chief of the Construction Department, investigated the site for three days and conducted detailed research. He believed that the cause of the slippage was (1) the sweeping work was not strong enough to withstand the soil pressure and moved outward, and (2) the silt at the bottom of the river could not withstand the soil pressure and retreated and arched upward, causing the embankment slope to sink. The remedies were only two kinds: sinking rows and filling pits. However, the sinking row project was time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly, and its location was appropriate for the accumulation of rocks in the heart of the river, which would inevitably be dangerous for future ship traffic. Therefore, he changed to the latter method and added a layer of soil curtain to the slope to repair the sweeping work.</p>
<p>(Xu Ji Talks About the Difficult Canal Project) On the 24th, Xu Ji, the section chief and technician of the Zhenjiang Construction Department, Xu's given name is Decheng, a native of Nantong, is rich in water conservancy engineering experience. He has invented several kinds of water conservancy surveying instruments and engineering methods. Last year, most of the difficult projects on the Northern Jiangsu Canal were designed and resolved by him. Xu talked to me (Xu said that he had traveled around the world to investigate water conservancy, and felt that although each had its strengths and weaknesses, the old Chinese method was the best in comparison. When I tell people this, I am often ridiculed for being pedantic, but the facts are so and cannot be ignored. Last year, the largest breach in the eastern dike of the canal was the restoration of Dangjunlou. I mainly used the sinking row method, using stones to press the purple row to sink, and on one side, the weight of the stones was used to balance the soil pressure. On one side, the water leakage effect of the row was used to reduce the moisture in the silt before it was completed. However, some technical personnel still advocated trying the method of building with stones. As a result, more than 1.3 million yuan was spent, but it still collapsed and was eventually replaced with the old sinking row method.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Inland River Machinery Factory has been closed for a long time. After the new general manager took office, the reorganization had not been determined and had not been resolved for a long time. Until yesterday, it has been taken over by the Shipping Department, and the factory affairs have also been resolved. Work can be resumed from January 1st. The situation is urgently reported as follows:</p>
<p>(Layoff of Staff) The factory was originally independent and directly under the general manager. After Liu Hongsheng took office, he ordered it to be taken over by the Shipping Department to reduce the scope and save expenses. Section Chief Zhao Yuntai reorganized the factory affairs. Until yesterday, the factory's works Yao Fuxin, Yu Gengyi, deputy manager Shou Dongfu, deputy foreman Li Liantang, clerk Qiu Yiming, material procurement Pan Yinglong, document Xu Boyi, works accounting Zheng Binghua, material management Guo Chengfu, tool management Zhou Huanshi, Yao Zucha, accounting Xuan Erda, Yang Shaotang, assistant appraiser Zhang Huaida, material staff Wang Ruiqing, and others were all laid off. In addition to paying their salaries, they were also paid a month's salary for retirement.</p>
<p>(Staff Retained and Appointed) The staff retained by the Shipping Department, who have been assigned duties and requested to be appointed by the general manager, include supervisor Ge Zongyuan, clerk Zhuo Wenzao, accountant Jiang Yongda, and chief foreman Cai Zhenhou, etc. The department has informed these four members to be responsible for staying in the factory to handle matters.</p>
<p>(Factory Director Resigns) Factory director Yao Jiefu submitted his resignation when General Manager Liu took office. After being retained, he was ordered to continue to try it out for three months. Now that the factory affairs have been reorganized, Yao Jiefu originally requested to continue to be re-elected, but Yao repeatedly insisted on resigning, and his resignation was submitted yesterday. The bureau has approved it and will appoint a special commissioner.</p>

<p>Planning to Obtain a Percentage from Horse Racing</p>
<p>The United Chamber of Commerce of the War Zone in Zhabei has spared no effort in organizing relief efforts since the January 28th Incident. As winter approaches, they have been doing their utmost to provide clothing and rice. However, disaster victims saw reports that a percentage of the International Racecourse's profits would be used to aid the disaster area. Therefore, the victims have been flocking to the Chamber of Commerce daily to apply for relief. But the Chamber has not yet received concrete news from the municipal government regarding the horse racing percentage, and therefore has been unable to give the disaster victims a definite answer. This has led to increasing numbers of victims gathering and accusing the Chamber, their voices rising in a clamorous manner. Eventually, the Chamber's committee members repeatedly persuaded them, promising to petition the municipal government and provide a response in the near future, before the crowd dispersed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees received a telegram from Mr. Yang Mingsheng in Rehe yesterday, stating that he was entrusted by Mr. Zhu Zi to investigate the disaster situation in Rehe. Starting from the provincial capital, and passing through Pingquan, Lingyuan, Jianping, Suidong, Kailu, Lubei, Chaoyang, Fuxin, and Lingnan, most of the province has suffered from drought and hail disasters. The rural areas are completely bankrupt, and fewer than 10% of businesses remain.

He implores them to show great compassion and provide relief to save those on the brink of death, expressing extreme gratitude and anticipation in the telegram. Signed, Yang Mingsheng.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill Labor Dispute Still Unresolved After Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Management Decides to Continue Suspending the Night Shift</p>
<p>The Labor Union to Hold a General Meeting Today to Discuss</p>
<p>The Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill in Zhoujiaqiao, due to sluggish business, decided to suspend the night shift in the weaving room, starting with Group 111 on December 8th, resulting in the unemployment of over 200 workers. The more than 1,000 workers on the entire night shift were in a state of panic. Despite repeated mediation by party and government agencies, no resolution was reached. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau formally convened a Labor-Management Mediation Committee to mediate according to law. Attending committee members included Tang Menghong and Wen Xirong from management, Fan Luquan and Sun Shouxing from the labor side, and Lu Yinchu from the Municipal Party Headquarters. Zhu Guilin, Chairman of the Social Affairs Bureau, presided, and Wang Zuofang served as the recorder. Representatives from each group of workers were also present. The management stated that business continued to be poor and that the remaining groups on the night shift, Groups 222 and 333, would inevitably be suspended by January of the 22nd year at the latest. The labor side argued that if all three groups were suspended, more than 1,000 workers would be unemployed and requested a postponement to avoid a labor strike. Regarding the suspension of Group 111, both sides agreed to change it to a rotating work system, with the original situation to be restored if business improved. Subsequently, discussions on calculating workers' wages on a monthly basis and the continued suspension of the other two night shift groups were postponed, as the labor side felt that the matter was significant and needed to be approved by a general meeting before a decision could be made. As a result, no agreement was reached. The Chairman announced that mediation would resume at 9:00 AM on the 28th, and the meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>The 10th District Cotton Textile Industry Labor Union has scheduled a representative meeting for 1:00 PM today to discuss the approach. It has already reported to the Public Security Bureau and requested police protection. The Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau will send representatives to provide guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Jiangsu High Court Again Rules the Labor Side Not Guilty in the Case of the Female Worker Killed at the Yongan Factory <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Labor Union Petitions to Resolve the Outstanding Case</p>
<p>Party and Government Agencies Confer and Review</p>
<p>Last year, the Yongan No. 2 Yarn Factory in Wusong's Yunzaobang had excellent business, earning over 2 million yuan. The workers requested bonuses, but the factory refused, leading to a labor strike. On the evening of December 20th last year, the factory suddenly closed its doors, refusing to allow the night shift workers to enter. The factory's hired police opened fire, killing one female worker, Jiao Lianying, on the spot, and arresting twelve workers. After investigation by the Shanghai District Court, the arrested workers were found not guilty. The prosecutor, dissatisfied, appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. A year has passed, and the court has finally reached a verdict, again finding the workers not guilty. However, three of the arrested workers died of illness while in custody during the trial, a truly tragic situation. The labor-management dispute remains unresolved to this day. Now that the Songhu Incident has concluded, the 8th District Cotton Textile Industry Labor Union feels that the outstanding case should be resolved and has brought up the old case again, requesting five items: 1) Four months of bonuses for the 20th year, totaling over 400,000 yuan according to regulations, to be distributed equally among the factory's 7,000+ workers; 2) Payment of wages for statutory revolutionary holidays in the 20th year; 3) Reinstatement of all workers dismissed without cause; 4) Strict orders for the factory to fulfill the labor-management agreement, as management has violated it; 5) Compensation from management for deceased and injured workers. Yesterday, the union sent representatives Shen Yongming, Jin Yaowen, Zhao Rongsheng, and Wang Yuncheng to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau. Li Weixiong from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Wang Bing from the Social Affairs Bureau received them and promised to confer with party and government agencies before reviewing the requests.</p>

<p>The Anhui Huai River Improvement Association sent official letters to the governments, chambers of commerce, agricultural associations, education bureaus, and finance bureaus of counties along the Huai River, such as Huaihai, Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province, Fengyang, Yingzhou, Sixian in Anhui Province, and counties in eastern Henan and southern Shandong. The letter stated, "Respected Sirs, the Huai River improvement issue concerns the interests of counties along the main and tributary streams of the Huai River in Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, and Henan provinces. Without a comprehensive plan, it is impossible to consider the overall situation. The Association's mission is to jointly advise and suggest to the government on the one hand, and to promote the autonomous organization and expression of opinions by the counties on the other, so that the Huai River improvement project can be implemented as soon as possible, thus permanently eliminating disasters, increasing production, and bringing deep benefits to the country and its people. Attached are a Huai River improvement proposal and a letter to fellow countrymen in each county. We respectfully hope that you will consider them sympathetically. We would be most grateful for your guidance." The letter also noted that the aforementioned proposal and letter to fellow countrymen can be obtained from the Association at No. 134, Pobo Fang, Luban Road, this city.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Japanese Ships Highly Active in China <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Monopolizing Shipping Rights in the Northeast: The Dalian Steamship Company's Changchun Maru, one of its newly built first-class passenger ships, ran aground and capsized outside Yantai Port during a storm last summer. The Dalian Steamship Company entrusted the Tokyo Imperial Salvage Company to salvage the ship, which took a month to complete. The damage was enormous. After being towed to Japan for major repairs, including repairing the holes and rebuilding the passenger cabins, it has now been fully completed. The company has now obtained exclusive shipping rights in the Northeast, monopolizing almost all shipping routes from Yingkou, Andong, Dalian, and other ports to various Chinese seaports. Therefore, the Changchun Maru has resumed sailing to Shanghai on January 4th and will return to the Northeast. At the same time, to handle the abundance of North China cargo, the company has dispatched the Liaoning River Maru and other ships to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Increasing Sailings to Rush Japanese Goods: Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Russian goods have been selling rapidly in China, especially next spring. Japanese merchants are taking advantage of this time to rush their stockpiled goods to China in order to dump them. Recently, Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) ships have been bringing inferior goods, with three ships arriving in Shanghai every week, carrying approximately 50,000 pieces. Another 55,000 pieces are scheduled to be loaded and shipped within the year. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line) is also taking the opportunity to add special China-Japan routes, dispatching the No. 2 Daian Maru and other ships to rush large quantities of Japanese goods to China. In addition, there are many other temporary Japanese ships coming to Shanghai, with at least two ships arriving every day.</p>

<p>Gu Shoushi, an old woman from Taicang, was 60 years old. She worked as a domestic helper for a certain family at No. 669 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession. At 6:40 PM on the 23rd, she went out and was crossing the road from south to north in front of No. 673 Avenue Edward VII. A car, No. 1550, driven by Ding Guoji, a chauffeur from a certain car dealership at No. 355 Jiujiang Road, was traveling east to west and was unable to avoid her. She was knocked down, suffering head injuries, and immediately fell unconscious. A policeman recorded the license plate number and sent the injured person to Renji Hospital for treatment, while taking the driver to the police station to report to the head of the station for investigation. The old woman, due to her age and severe injuries, died at 10:00 PM on the 24th. The hospital notified the police station, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Morgue for an autopsy. Yesterday morning, the Traffic Department summoned the deceased's relative, Gu Abao, to the case and reported it to the Second Special District Court, requesting Prosecutor Deng to come to the morgue. The prosecutor confirmed that the deceased had died from head injuries sustained when struck by a car. After the autopsy, the prosecutor returned to the courthouse, questioned the defendant about the circumstances of the accident, and then ordered the body to be released to the family after they signed a guarantee.

<p>Yesterday afternoon, when a southbound 京沪 train arrived in Shanghai, there was a poor man, about thirty years old, wearing thin and ragged clothes in the fourth-class carriage. He was unable to afford a ticket and sneaked in. However, upon arriving at the North Station, the ticket inspectors routinely checked tickets. He was unable to pass this difficult hurdle. In a moment of desperation, as the train was crossing a dry bridge and still moving at considerable speed, he disregarded his life and jumped off mid-journey to avoid censure. Unfortunately, he landed headfirst on the ground, his skull striking a stone. His brain and blood splattered everywhere, and he immediately fell unconscious. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was too late and he died. Yesterday, the Police Department instructed 吉一图 headman Yan Liugen to report the case to the District Court for autopsy.</p>

<p>(Anyang) This is the seventh excavation. The results of the first three excavations can be found in the Anyang Excavation Reports published by the Institute of History and Philology. The most recent four excavations have all involved discoveries related to Yin-Shang architecture. Yin-Shang architecture used rammed earth as its foundation. Currently, rectangular and square platforms have been discovered. The square platforms are made of pure yellow earth and have stone column foundations in front. Around the perimeter are several sets of complete pig bones, likely the site of Yin-Shang sacrifices. There are many such sites, and the Academia Sinica plans to continue excavating. In due course, a general outline of the Yin-Shang palace system should be obtained.</p>
<p>(Xun County) Excavation began in the spring of this year. There are many tombs from the Bronze Age in this area. They have been repeatedly looted and destroyed by local tyrants, ruffians, and antique dealers. Since the Archaeological Group began working here, eight tombs have been cleared, all of which have been looted, but still contain some remaining funerary objects, mostly chariot and horse decorations, as well as halberds, spears, axes, and other weapons. The most astonishing discovery is that these tombs often contain horses buried alive. Next to the tombs, horse pits were often built separately. The largest horse pit discovered contains the remains of over 60 horses, along with numerous chariot and horse decorations. The chariot decorations can be used to reconstruct a portion of the ancient war chariot system, which is a major recent contribution to the field of archaeology. There are still many unexcavated tombs of this type that have been looted. The Academia Sinica plans to continue clearing these tombs next spring, at which time new discoveries will be reported.</p>

<p>The Fire Insurance Compensation Advancement Association for Disaster Areas sent more than 20 representatives including Wang Zhixiang, Bian Yueqiu, Deng Xisheng, Zheng Shaojin, Zhuang Zhengli, and members of the claims committee to petition the Municipal Government at 2 PM yesterday. Yu Mingde, a clerk from the Second Section of the Municipal Government, received them. Bian Yueqiu stated the purpose of the petition. Yu Mingde replied that the Municipal Government is extremely concerned about the significant losses suffered by policyholders in the disaster area and is currently trying to negotiate with foreign merchants for early compensation, which he expects can be resolved soon. The representatives then left and went to petition the Social Affairs Bureau. Yu Tianbi, a clerk from the Second Section of the bureau, received them, saying that they have already submitted a request urging the Municipal Government to negotiate with foreign merchants as soon as possible to resolve the issue quickly. The foreign merchants have agreed to find ways to provide relief. He believes that further efforts to negotiate with them will achieve satisfactory results. The representatives then returned to the association and immediately convened an emergency meeting of all claims committee members. More than 30 people including Bian Yueqiu, Hu Yibo, Ye Baolin, Yuan Shixing, and Mao Xiangyi attended the meeting. Wang Zhixiang was elected as chairman, who reported on the matter.

In addition, Mr. Ha Qian, the general manager of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, was asked by Director Cai of the Municipal Finance Bureau to assist in selling the tickets, and an agreement has been reached. It is known that the company is one of the largest American-owned enterprises in Shanghai.

<h3 id="e145">Taxpayers' Association Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Department <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Telephone Price Increase</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession has sent another letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department regarding the telephone price increase. The letter states: "To the Director-General: We received a letter from the First District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Federation and the Nanjing Road Business Federation, which included a reply from the Public Works Department in response to their letter of December 1st. The reply listed the Shanghai Telephone Company's losses over the years as justification for the telephone price increase. We hereby reply: The Public Works Department previously published an article in the newspapers on November 18th to defend the company regarding the telephone price increase. Our association has already strongly refuted this article. The department's reasons still favor the company and its biased view is excessive. Although the telephone company has incurred significant expenses due to the replacement of new equipment, according to its own statement, from the establishment of the company on August 5, 1930, to the end of September this year, a total of 26 months, the company has lost a total of 218,430 taels of silver. Even considering the losses over 26 months, the Shanghai Telephone Company, despite its efforts to expand its lines more than fourfold and employing mostly Westerners with high salaries, has suffered losses due to extravagance and miscalculation. This cannot be a sufficient reason for a substantial increase in prices and retroactive compensation. The only way to resolve the current situation and quell the unrest is for an impartial organization to appoint accounting experts to audit the accounts to determine whether the price increase is necessary and whether the amount of the increase is reasonable, in order to seek a fair solution. We hope you will not succumb to pressure and abandon your responsibility to sacrifice the interests of the majority. Furthermore, we have not yet received a reply to our association's letter to the Public Works Department on November 15th. We do not know why. We are including this information and hope that you will investigate. We have repeatedly requested that this case be submitted to the board of directors of your department for reconsideration. We believe that the above information can assist in resolving the case. Therefore, we are writing to you to request your investigation and hope to receive a reply soon so that the public will not have to wait in anticipation."</p>

<p>Business rickshaws in Shanghai West have not been registered in this city and have been operating privately. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau started inspecting them on November 15th. By the end of November, the number of inspected vehicles reached as many as 4,328, which is feared to be an oversupply. This has an impact on the livelihood of rickshaw pullers. The Public Utilities Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Public Security Bureau have jointly discussed three restrictions: (1) All rickshaws operating beyond the boundaries of the four districts of Fahua, Pusan, Caojing, and Zhenru, and operating in other districts of the city, will have their temporary operating permits and donation certificates revoked. (2) Assuming that the city increases the number of business rickshaws in the future, holding a temporary operating permit for Shanghai West will not give priority to obtaining a license plate, and the regulations at that time will still apply. (3) All those who fail to pay the donation within the monthly stipulated period will have their temporary operating permits and donation certificates revoked. It is learned that the above measures have been approved by the Municipal Government and will be announced jointly by the four bureaus for public information.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products organized the Shanghai West National Products Mobile Exhibition. Since its opening, it has been a week. The venue is located in the Caobaojia Du Zhaoqi Middle School sports field, which is spacious and suitable, and the transportation is convenient.

<p>Cha Liangzhao, Director of the National Government Relief Committee's Emergency Relief Office, Quan Shaowu, Special Commissioner for Relief Affairs in Northern Anhui, Yang Shucheng, Transport Assistant, and Wang Fanwu were prosecuted by the Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Tingqi has held court hearings several times, but they are not yet half finished. The plaintiff's lawyer was dissatisfied and requested Judge Wu's recusal in court. The case was suspended. The court has not yet made a clear statement on whether to recuse, so the continued hearing of the case is also undecided. However, Chen Lvzheng, representative of disaster victims in Wuhe County, Tan Shaohua, representative of Lingbi, and Cheng Ziheng, representative of Lingsheng, who came to Shanghai to testify, have now been sued for defamation in another case by Quan Shaowu. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the First Special Court summoned them for trial. The plaintiff, Quan Shaowu, was absent, and his lawyer appeared in court, stating that Quan had left Shanghai on official business and requested a four-week adjournment. The three defendants, Tan, etc., unanimously opposed, stating that Quan had already filed a complaint and should be present for cross-examination. He should not be absent without reason and should be withdrawn according to law. The defendants all have official duties and cannot be detained in another place for a long time. If the adjournment is approved, they requested an adjournment of six weeks to allow them to return to their hometowns. Judge Liu then granted the request and ordered an adjournment of six weeks for another hearing.</p>

<p>Yu Chengyuan, a native of Ningbo, 26 years old, went to the Maochang Egg Store in Yingzhao, Anhui on November 15th. He falsely claimed to the manager, Chen Zhengbiao, that he wanted to go to Sanhe Village, 100 miles away, to purchase goods and stayed for several days. Because Yu had worked in the store two years ago and had a teacher-student relationship with Chen, Chen agreed. Yu took advantage of the fact that no one was in the accounting room and stole three Wuhu Central Bank checks from the store, privately affixed the official seal, filled out one check for 1,000 yuan in foreign currency, and left without saying goodbye. He went to Sanhe Village and asked Wang Dengxiang, a fellow merchant, to cash the check. Wang said that the check was from the 23rd period and was not</p>

<p>Photography Circle Donates Large Number of Treasures</p>
<p>The other day was the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee, was filled with emotion and could not help but write a couplet despite being ill. The text read: "With bare hands, one can capture Han Kui; sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall, one can avenge Fuchai." The couplet was eight feet long, with vigorous strokes, and was donated to the National Artists Donation Exhibition of Works for the Northeast Volunteer Army. At the same time, famous photographers Lu Shifu, Chen Fulin, Wu Zhongxing, Xu Dexian, and Zhuang Zenghu donated many precious photographic works. Zhang Danru donated 24 sets of "The Song of Everlasting Regret", which are extremely valuable. Yu Huanzheng donated eight pieces of calligraphy and painting by contemporary people. Ji Jinggong, Li Monong, Liu Kansheng, Cheng Zhaoxiang, Lu Ruoyan, Da Cai, Wang Yunsheng, and others donated more than 60 pieces of calligraphy and painting. Yu Feiai of Beiping, Sheng Shuxian of Suzhou, Qiao Jingliang of Xinghua, and Tao Shoubo of Jiujiang also sent dozens of pieces of calligraphy and painting.</p>
<p>approved without further inquiry. Yu wrote a letter to Chen Zhengbiao, detailing the number of eggs he was buying, and showed the letter to Wang, asking if he could be given 100 yuan in foreign currency first, and the remaining checks would be settled when they expired. Wang was fooled and paid him 660 yuan. Yu then took the money and fled without a trace. When the check expired and was presented to the bank for payment, it was inspected and found to have been filled out by someone else and was not written by the Maochang Egg Store. It was immediately returned. Wang then telegraphed Chen Zhengbiao, the manager of Maochang, who found out that the check had been stolen by Yu Chengyuan and immediately announced it in the Wuhu newspaper to stop payment. Later, he learned that Yu had fled to Shanghai and was staying in room 235 of the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road. Chen went to Shanghai overnight and reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent Chinese Detective Shi En and Detective An Enben to secretly investigate. They arrested Yu at the address and took him to the police station for detention. The next morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the situation and stated that the defendant admitted at the police station that there were two more checks, which had been torn up and destroyed. Chen Zhengbiao further stated that the defendant was a student of his at the Maochang Store and had resigned several years ago. He suddenly came and said that a certain store in Shanghai had asked him to purchase goods and had 3,000 taels of silver. He wanted to go to Sanhe Village, so he stayed at the store temporarily. He also briefly described the situation. When questioned, the defendant confessed that he was idle at home and suddenly received a letter from a friend saying that a certain hotel in Shanghai was recruiting staff and needed a deposit of 400 yuan. He brought the money to Shanghai, but the friend could not be found. He had to stay at a hotel. During the month, he spent all his money on pleasure and gambling and owed more than 300 yuan to others. He could not make up for it, so he went to the Wuhu Maochang Head Office and asked his brother for a loan, which was refused. He was confused for a moment and took this measure. The other two checks had been torn up and discarded. He begged for forgiveness. Judge Zhao Linyu ordered him to be detained and await sentencing at a fixed date.</p>

<p>Construction is Relatively Difficult</p>
<p>Opening Before New Year's Day is Not Possible</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in this city has been under construction since the bidding process and has been going on for four months. The first phase of the project was completed in early December. The second phase of the project, such as stacking artificial mountains, revetment of the pond bank, installation of water pipes and electric lights, and laying grass and planting trees, is also half completed. The unfinished part is currently in progress. In addition, due to factual needs, a peacock pavilion and an aviary have been added outside the scope of the previous two weeks of the project. The aviary is built on the edge of the pond, half on land and half in the water. The construction is more difficult. It is estimated that it will not be completed until the end of January next year. It is feared that it will not be able to open before New Year's Day.</p>

<p>The woman, surnamed Shen Wu, was from Tongzhou and was only 25 years old. Her husband, Shen Dianxi, was a foreman and was nearly 60 years old. Because his wife had no children for several years, he took Shen Wu as a concubine in the hope that she would bear him a son. The family lived at No. 206 Hua Ji Road. In April of this year, Shen Wu gave birth to twins, which made Shen very happy and treated her with even greater importance. However, recently, Shen Wu became addicted to gambling and was immersed in it all day long. All her money and jewelry were lost to gambling. Although her husband knew about it and tried to dissuade her, she remained addicted and unrepentant. The other night, while Shen Wu was feeding her child, the child suddenly cried incessantly. Shen Wu realized that her milk had dried up. She was filled with resentment and conceived the idea of ending her life. She secretly swallowed opium and committed suicide. Her husband discovered it and sent her to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but she died. The hospital reported it to the Huishan Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. They took the body to the Philand Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Zhan Liangce to inspect the body, accompanied by Forensic Medical Secretary Wang Zuyi. They certified the body and took testimony from Shen Dianxi, the husband of the deceased. Shen Dianxi stated that the deceased was his concubine. Recently, she liked to gamble and did not listen to his advice, even neglecting the child. This time, she suddenly committed suicide because she had no milk to feed the child, and the child cried all night, causing her resentment. However, he did not quarrel with her. After receiving the testimony, Prosecutor Zhan ruled that the deceased, Shen Wu, was a woman who died from opium poisoning before her death. The body was handed over to her husband, Shen Dianxi, to claim the coffin and burial. The opium was taken to the hospital for incineration.</p>

<p>Even Used His Guarantor's Name</p>
<p>Forged a 300-Yuan IOU</p>
<p>Wang Yaoting, the accountant of Ma Dunhe Hat Shop, had been employed for more than ten years. At first, he seemed loyal, but in recent years, his behavior suddenly changed. He was addicted to prostitution and gambling. His salary was not enough to cover his expenses, so he privately embezzled the store's funds and falsified accounts. The store owner, Ma Yizhong, discovered it this summer. After checking the accounts, it was found that as much as 13,500 yuan had been embezzled. Wang also felt that he could not face anyone, so he asked his original guarantor, Wang Defu, to mediate. Ma Yizhong did not want to pursue the matter in depth out of consideration for feelings and allowed him to continue in his original position. However, he later discovered that Wang had falsified a public record passbook for 400 taels. Ma Yizhong could no longer tolerate it and reported it to the police station according to law, filing a lawsuit for forgery and fraud. The First Special District Court sentenced Wang to four months in prison. However, the day after the defendant was imprisoned, Wang Yuji suddenly came to the hat shop with the passbook to withdraw 700 yuan in principal and interest. After checking the books, it was learned that the passbook was also forged by Wang. When the deposit was made, Wang Yaoting had already pocketed the money. However, the hat shop could not let the depositor lose his principal and interest, so the hat shop immediately paid the principal and interest. At the same time, the hat shop continued to check the accounts and found a forged 300-yuan IOU from Wang Fuji. Wang Fuji is Wang Yaoting's guarantor, Wang Deyu. This can truly be said to be repaying kindness with evil. Now, Ma Yizhong believes that Wang has committed numerous acts of embezzlement and that the original sentence is not enough to cover his guilt. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to file a complaint regarding the newly discovered two acts of embezzlement, requesting that the defendant be brought to justice and punished in accordance with Articles 224, 351, and 363 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Qian held a hearing and brought the defendant from the Western Prison. After examining the evidence, he ordered a postponement for further questioning of witnesses and ordered the defendant to be returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e160">㈠ How to Strive Out of a Corrupt Family <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Mr. Liu Youwei</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Song Shize’s letter and your reporter’s response in today’s newspaper, I have the following thoughts: ㈠ In the current social situation, corrupt families of feudal remnants cannot be fundamentally eradicated; thus, Mr. Song’s problem will not be fundamentally solved. ㈡ Advising Mr. Song’s mother to find a job and support herself is certainly a proper method, but when it comes to finding a job, "how easy is it?" Now, many college graduates cannot find a job that pays twenty or thirty yuan a month. Where would a middle-aged, dull, old-fashioned woman find a job? If Mr. Song wants to break away from her, it seems inhumane. ㈢ Mr. Song's father and his concubine are indeed "living in the old society, within the category of feudal remnants." Suicide is out of the question, so the only option is to let them "sit and wait for death." This is a painful solution, but in today's society, there are probably quite a few people like Mr. Song's parents. If we listen to them and let them live or die on their own, that is not the attitude that people who study social problems should have. What do Mr. Song and your reporter think about this?</p>
<p>Answer: What you said in your letter is insightful. However, when we study social problems, especially with readers who are studying pressing personal problems, we should divide it into two steps: The first step is to contribute some practical solutions within our limited knowledge so that readers will not be disappointed and feel their questions are not answered. The second step is that if every practical problem is solved only from the practical, individual phenomena, ignoring its social and economic root causes, that is, the motive force of the motive force, then although the reader has obtained a considerable solution, the social root cause has not been fundamentally solved. Therefore, readers should be reminded at any time and place so that everyone does not only focus on the individual phenomena of reality and forget the causes and common connections behind this phenomenon. Yesterday's reply to Mr. Song was only to provide some insights on the urgent problems he needed to solve. As for Mr. Song's family situation, it is still a large part of China, at least a common phenomenon in a large part of the old society. Solving this problem cannot be achieved overnight. If you really want to help, then at least the following conditions are required: ㈠ National capitalization or national industrialization under the people's regime; ㈡ Strict punishments should be used to implement the prohibition of opium, and it should not be expressly prohibited while secretly encouraged; Concubinage is strictly prohibited; Those who take concubines shall not enjoy civil rights; ㈣ The state should use all its efforts to implement universal education, and secondary school education should be completely funded by the state. Students should be free of charge regardless of class or gender: ㈤ People should be unconditionally allowed to have freedom of assembly, association and publication, so that people's intelligence and talent can be fully developed, so as not to submerge and thwart people's interest and mood in striving upwards: ㈥ The right to education of young students and young children has absolute protection. If they are out of school at the age of study, their fathers and brothers should be severely punished. There must be a major upheaval to stir up a social upheaval, which is absolutely unimaginable under the current political and economic situation. This is why the reporter temporarily ignores and disregards the problem of rescuing Mr. Song's father and his concubine. As for the reporter's suggestion that Mr. Song should break away from her when it is absolutely necessary (if she does not listen to his advice), it seems wrong, but in fact, it is all based on the standpoint of the entire society. If Mr. Song lives with his mother, both of them will have no way out. For the sake of the future of society, temporarily abandoning Mr. Song's mother and letting Mr. Song get rid of it is also the meaning of "weighing the two evils and taking the lesser." This may cause the old men in the Minglun Hall to sigh and criticize it! What do you think?</p>
<h3 id="e161">㈡ This is a Social Problem <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Letter from Mr. Zhu Ying</p>
<p>(Regarding the discussion on the economic oppression issue raised by Mr. Weng, Mr. Weng's original letter and Mr. Zhu's discussion letter can be found in this column on October 19th and 22nd)</p>
<p>I am generally satisfied with the points you answered. However, since your newspaper has a special column to solve some difficult problems for readers, everyone is happy to hear the news when they have any doubts, and once your newspaper replies, they will follow it like a needle, thinking that there will be a solution in the future. Therefore, your newspaper should be careful in its statements. If it can partially solve the problem, it should help solve it. Otherwise, it should tell him other ways out, or at least withhold judgment! For example, in your newspaper's reply to Mr. Weng, it says: "As long as you can endure hardship, you will not starve to death." In the current Chinese society, this sentence seems too affirmative. You should know that even in Shanghai, which seems to be very prosperous on the surface, if a hard-working poor person does not rely on the support of relatives and friends, I am afraid that many people will starve to death! If you, sir, are willing to make in-depth observations, you will know. From this point of view, if Mr. Weng believes it to be true after receiving your newspaper's reply, and if he loses his principal's job in the future and tries hard to find a job, either the factory will not add people, or it will not want novices. Or even if he finds a job, the factory will either close down due to the influence of the current situation, or he will be exhausted all day long due to the result of rationalizing production and will not get enough to eat. At this time, although Mr. Weng's family did not starve to death, they were half-dead from starvation; when he had no choice, he had to take the path of suicide; on the one hand, it made society distrust your newspaper's guidance. If your newspaper had clearly told Mr. Weng from the beginning: "This is a problem for the entire society. To solve your individual problem, you have to solve the entire society. As for solving the urgent needs of the moment, it is not without merit, but it is just 'treating the head when it hurts and treating the foot when it hurts'." If you are willing to turn your head around and say this, Mr. Weng may shift his focus to transforming society, so that he will not waste his energy in vain, and it is also your newspaper's true fulfillment of its guiding mission. In short, the current society is not a problem of "having or not having", but a problem of "distribution". I hope that your newspaper will tell the masses this without ambiguity.</p>
<p>I am not argumentative, I hope your newspaper will be a star of society, and a star for the eternal future. I wonder what your reporter thinks?</p>
<p>Reply: We are very happy that you are willing to discuss with us repeatedly. You talked about: We should have clearly told Mr. Weng from the beginning: "This is a problem for the entire society," and called him to focus on transforming society from the beginning. In fact, this meaning has been hidden in our original reply to Mr. Weng, but the wording is slightly obscure. I have already explained the rest in the previous letter, so I will not repeat it here. I respectfully acknowledge all your instructions!</p>

Playing Chinese instruments such as erhu, sanxian, pipa, yueqin, shengxiao, flute, etc.), Note: Students may choose one of the above instruments to learn as needed,</p>
<p>Fourth, Summary of Implementation Methods</p>
<p>(1) Homework Requirements,</p>
<p>㈠ Singing is divided into "basic exercises" and "songs" for teaching.</p>
<p>㈡ Music theory is divided into "reading music", general knowledge of music, and "introduction to harmony" for teaching, but if necessary, a "small song composition method" may be added.</p>
<p>㈢ For instrumental music, students choose one of the organ, piano, violin, and national instruments to learn extracurricularly, but it may be temporarily absent due to school equipment difficulties and other circumstances.</p>
<p>(2) Teaching Points,</p>
<p>㈠ From now on, the movable-do solfège method should be eliminated and replaced with the fixed-do solfège method currently used in various countries (the Ministry of Education is compiling a summary of the theory of the fixed-do solfège method and an elaboration of the comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of the movable-do solfège method).</p>
<p>㈡ Special attention should be paid to basic exercises in singing, because general students often neglect them because they are not pleasing to the ear, so teachers must sincerely guide them.</p>
<p>㈢ Basic exercises must be performed within five or ten minutes before each singing, and the last five minutes must be used to sing songs that have been sung well or are particularly loved. ㈣ The sheet music must be completely in staff notation and absolutely no numbered notation should be used. ㈤ When selecting teaching materials, it is advisable to select more majestic and lively songs. If you are inclined to sad and frequent songs, it is best to use them less except when necessary, and all decadent sounds must be eliminated.</p>
<p>㈥ Regardless of single or multiple tones, it is best to select songs with accompaniment. When teaching, the teacher should also use playing accompaniment as the standard. In this way, students can develop the habit of listening to polyphony while singing, so as to increase their appreciation of music. However, after the new song is sung well, they must develop the habit of singing alone without musical instruments.</p>
<p>㈦ When students sing, pay attention to their pronunciation, mouth shape, attitude, expression, etc., and correct them at any time.</p>
<p>㈧ Pay attention to the common range of students. If students are in the "changing voice period", they should be temporarily suspended from singing.</p>
<p>㈨ The division of parts for multiple-tone singing must be determined based on the total number of students, gender, and individual range. Generally, girls sing high notes and boys sing low notes. As for trio and quartet choral pieces, both boys and girls must be divided into two parts, but in schools where there are particularly few girls or where boys and girls are separated, special attention must be paid to the division of parts.</p>
<p>㈩ Long-scale keys should be used more often for songs, and short-scale keys should be used less often.</p>
<p>㈩㈠ Students should be required to sing songs faithfully, and it is strictly forbidden to add tunes and glissandos at will, so that the fun of teaching songs will flow into baseness.</p>
<p>㈩㈡ When lecturing on "reading music", in addition to enabling students to read music, they must also practice writing music, and they must also practice "dictation" within a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>㈩㈢ When lecturing on "general knowledge of music", it is advisable to prepare more famous records of vocal and instrumental music, and use the phonograph at any time so that students can have more opportunities to appreciate them. When famous musicians perform and concerts are held locally, they must be required to attend.</p>
<p>㈩㈣ When lecturing on "harmony", it is advisable to refer to and explain actual musical works at any time.</p>
<p>㈩㈤ Students with special talents can be asked to learn musical instruments (such as organ, piano, etc.) extracurricularly, and "small song composition methods" can be lectured on when necessary to allow them to try to compose simple songs.</p>

<h3 id="e164">The Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools Not to Use Exaggerated Words for Publicity <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to all private secondary schools, stating that according to Yu Ziyu, the principal of the private Southeast Women's Physical Education Normal School, in his presentation of opinions on rectifying private schools, many physical education schools in Shanghai use publicity as a tool for enrollment, such as placing advertisements and submitting news articles about the number of lectures given at certain places, the construction of school buildings, gymnasiums, sports fields, and swimming pools, etc., and also organizing teams to reach South America and the Americas, etc., all of which are promoted in this way. In fact, the so-called school buildings are only two or three residential houses, and as for the track and field, there is not even a running track, let alone other equipment. It goes without saying that students who live far away in other provinces do not know the truth and are deceived by such news. The bureau should issue a notice to all newspapers that such self-submitted publicity news must be verified before it is allowed to be published, so as not to deceive students from afar. According to this investigation, some private schools have been recruiting new students recently, and some of them specialize in publicity and do not focus on practical matters, which is originally inappropriate. In the future, when all schools publish enrollment advertisements, issue enrollment brochures, printed materials, etc., they must be realistic and truthful, and they must not use exaggerated words for publicity. If they dare to violate this deliberately, they will be severely punished once they are found to be in violation. This order is hereby notified.</p>

<p>Opening on New Year's Day is Not True</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in this city has been under construction since the bidding, and it has been four months. The first phase of the project was fully completed at the beginning of this month. The second phase of the project, such as piling up artificial mountains, repairing the banks of the pool, installing water pipes and lights, and paving grass and planting trees, etc., has also been half completed. The unfinished part is currently in active progress. In addition, due to factual needs, a peacock pavilion and a mixed poultry house have been added outside the scope of the first two phases of the project. The mixed poultry house is built on the edge of the pool, half on land and half in water. The project is more difficult to carry out and will probably not be completed until the end of January next year. The previous rumor that it would open on New Year's Day is not true.</p>

The discussion items were: ㈠ Director Niu forwarded the request of Wang Quan Primary School to use tuition fees to offset the construction funds and to add a class at the beginning of the spring semester of the next academic year. Decision: In addition to the fixed tuition fees that should still be paid to the bureau, the surplus amount is allowed to be used to offset the construction funds. If it is still insufficient, the collection of construction fees should be allowed, but a method must be formulated and submitted to the bureau for approval and implementation. The addition of classes will still be done according to the previous discussion. ㈡ Fang Er Primary School requested to hire an assistant teacher and increase the subsidy. Decision: It is difficult to approve because it involves changing the budget. ㈢ How should the Shanghai Office of this bureau be relocated after the treatment? Decision: Qian Zhonghou and Xi Sibu were designated to draft the rules, which will be submitted to the next meeting for discussion.</p>

From then on, in Group A of the Western Union, Donghua's hope has increased by one layer, and there is great hope for leading the heroes and dominating the hegemony. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Qian Jingyong</p>
<p>Li Ning Wu Youzhang Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>(Donghua) Lu Zhongen Feng Yunyou Li Yichen</p>
<p>Guan Xun'an Tu Kaiyuan Chen Jiaqiu</p>
<p>Chen Yutian</p>

<h3 id="e177">Comparison of the Strengths of the Two Teams <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Tung Wah: Iron Gate Zhou Xianyan, dressed in a traditional Chinese robe and mandarin jacket yesterday, looking refined and scholarly, sat in the one-dollar seats with his beloved Ms. Zhang Chunxun. When asked why he wasn't playing in such a big match, Zhou replied that he had injured his shin in a previous game against Lancashire and hadn't fully recovered. Therefore, in yesterday's match, A-Lu (Zhong En) took his place. Forward Chen Hongguang was also unable to play due to a foot injury, so Wan Xianghua filled the left inside forward position. Spectators on the left were worried about Tung Wah's lineup. However, once the fierce battle began, Tung Wah's strength not only didn't suffer the slightest loss, but the entire team seemed invigorated, with a solid formation. The forwards ran quickly, breaking through defenses and threatening the goal, often catching the opponent off guard. Chen Jiaqiu, in particular, was well-liked, achieving everything he desired. Xianghua and Jingyong were small and nimble, perfectly suited to their roles. Center Li Yichen's footwork was sharp and his shots were quick, but he tended to delay when dribbling and passing. The three halfbacks and two fullbacks were all outstanding, doing their best to control the enemy, creating an impenetrable defense, full of fighting spirit. Even the strong Western Police forwards couldn't find a weakness. Goalkeeper A-Lu had long been famous at sea for catching high balls, but yesterday he not only demonstrated his mastery of high balls but also handled low balls with ease. In short, yesterday's Tung Wah had a well-organized formation and an unusually full spirit.</p>
<p>Western Police: Yesterday's Western Police seemed slightly weaker in their fighting ability. It was a pity that they lacked shooting talent; even when they reached the goal, it was in vain. Individually, right fullback Crawford was indeed weak, with soft footwork and unable to intercept the enemy's advances. Halfback Hurley ran tirelessly but to no avail, allowing Chen Jiaqiu to advance freely and unhindered, which was a major loss and weakness for Western Police. Among the forwards, Wakenshaw was the most outstanding, displaying the demeanor of an experienced veteran. Wu Youliang and Guan Xun'an were not easy to stop. Whenever Western Police attacked, the ball invariably came up the left side, with excellent crosses, almost never missing. Unfortunately, the central support was weak, resulting in wasted efforts. Duffy, a talented halfback, was reassigned to inside forward, acting like a headless fly, unsure of what to do. Pike, Jackson, and Oakley were still respectable but couldn't score. The mainstay of Western Police, center-half Kasha, surprisingly lost his nerve yesterday, his veteran reputation crumbling into confusion. His panicky state contributed to Western Police's defeat, making him partly to blame.</p>
<h3 id="e178">A Glimpse of the Competitive Situation <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Western Police Have Terrible Luck: Western Police conceded a goal within two minutes of the start of the match, and this loss must be attributed to Kasha's mishandling, heading the ball into his own net. This was an omen of Western Police's failure. Otherwise, how could they have accurately thrown themselves into the net during such an important match, destroying their own prestige? This was one of Western Police's major misfortunes. After conceding this goal, Western Police certainly didn't resign themselves to weakness; they worked hard and actively counterattacked, surrounding Tung Wah's goal, firing shots like a string of firecrackers for more than ten minutes. Wakenshaw delivered four or five excellent corner kicks in a row, and Jackson and Pike had five or six shots, but they achieved nothing. This was Western Police's second major misfortune. The ineffective siege allowed Tung Wah to score another goal. This was Western Police's third major misfortune. After much hard work and repeated efforts, they finally scored a goal in return. Shortly after, they had a penalty kick opportunity, which could have easily turned their hatred into joy and transformed danger into safety, creating a 2-2 tie. However, Kasha's kick was saved by Tung Wah goalkeeper Lu Zhongen, missing the opportunity and destroying his own prestige. Otherwise, after creating a 2-2 tie, the subsequent situation would have been completely different, and the outcome might have been reversed. This was Western Police's fourth major misfortune. With these four points, it can be said that they had terrible luck.</p>
<p>Tung Wah Were Pleasantly Surprised: Tung Wah had a good start, with luck shining upon them. Western Police besieged their goal but failed to score, and A-Lu saved the penalty kick. This was Tung Wah's good fortune and blessing. Kasha scored an own goal, but even though Western Police had terrible luck, they could still remedy the situation with the subsequent penalty kick. However, Kasha failed, preventing them from achieving a 2-2 tie. In the second half, they conceded another goal and then another, losing repeatedly. Western Police's courage was lost, and they had no choice but to lose. Tung Wah were pleasantly surprised and overjoyed. Tung Wah can be called lucky. They have a high chance of winning the Group A championship this year. However, being lucky is one thing; high performance requires a solid formation and strong combat power to achieve this.</p>
<h3 id="e179">The Fierce Battle of the First Half <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Kasha Scores Own Goal: As the bell rang three times and referee Marshall blew the whistle, the battle began. Tung Wah kicked off and advanced a few steps, but Western Police counter-pressed. Jackson dribbled forward, but Li Ning intercepted. Kasha and Wan Xianghua both lost their footing, and Qian Jingyong got the ball and pressed toward the goal. Blocked by Crawford, he passed it in front of the goal. The ball grazed the goal to the right. Li Yichen, Chen Jiaqiu, and the Western Police goalkeeper all missed it. Chen Jiaqiu caught up and shot at the goal. In a panic, Kasha crashed into the ball, mistakenly hitting it into his own net. Tung Wah received this unexpected joy, and the surrounding spectators were overjoyed. It was less than two minutes from the start of the match, which can be described as extremely fast.</p>
<p>Full of Storms: Western Police were extremely frustrated by this misfortune, so they reorganized their forces and launched a rapid counterattack. From then on, Tung Wah's goal was besieged, full of storms, with everyone on edge. Oakley crossed the ball into the center, and Jackson headed it, but the ball grazed the left side. Wakenshaw's attempt to sneak through failed and was saved by Guan Xun'an. Western Police missed their first opportunity. Wakenshaw refused to give up and dribbled the ball forward again, passing it to Duffy, who passed it to Pike. This gentleman's shot was too high, missing their second opportunity. Hurley won a corner kick. Wakenshaw made a beautiful cross, and Lu Zhongen jumped up to save it. Western Police missed their third opportunity. Wakenshaw delivered another corner kick, but it was again saved by A-Lu. Western Police missed their fourth opportunity. Wakenshaw relied on his lifelong heroism to invade alone, crossing the ball from a suitable position. Jackson was in a good position, seemingly poised for success, but Tu Kaiyuan, seeing the opportunity was not good, chased and intercepted. Thus, Western Police missed their fifth opportunity. Finally, Western Police attacked for the sixth time. Oakley crossed the corner kick, and Wu Youliang blocked Wakenshaw's action and cleared the danger. Pike shot at the goal but it was caught. After all, Western Police were flawless. Western Police had launched seven attacks, creating a strong momentum. Tung Wah's goal was momentarily uneasy. Tung Wah resisted the invaders, flawlessly, which surprised and delighted the spectators.</p>
<p>Attempted Theft Failed: The more intense the pressure, the fiercer the resistance. After enduring the pressure for a long time and turning danger into safety, Tung Wah launched a counterattack. Yu Tian advanced along the side and passed to Jiaqiu, who shot at the goal, very urgently. The goalkeeper blocked it out. Western Police attacked again. Li Ning lost his footing, and Pike sneaked in, but he also lost his footing, regretting it. After that, Jackson and Pike took turns attacking the goal, and Tung Wah saved them one by one. After a long time of melee, Oakley kicked out a corner kick. In the melee, Pike kicked the ball into the goal, but Duffy committed a foul. Therefore, the attempted theft failed and cost them dearly, causing a hollow joy.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Situation in the Second Half <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Exchanging Goals: The second battle began, and the melee lasted for ten minutes, with few highlights. Suddenly, Chen Chutian delivered a corner kick, and the Western Police goalkeeper lost his guard. Li Yichen waited in front of the goal and poked the ball into the net, giving Tung Wah a two-goal lead. Seeing the situation was not good, Western Police mobilized their entire army and tried to advance. Winger Oakley sent the ball in front of the goal, where it landed in the corner. Wakenshaw saw the ball and chased it, aiming at the shadow of the ball and heading it into the goal. The situation was very beautiful, making it 2-1.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick: Western Police were encouraged by this goal and their spirits were boosted. Crawford sent the ball forward. Wakenshaw dribbled forward, passed Li Ning, and was about to shoot at the goal, but he lost the opportunity due to his flustered footwork. Suddenly, the Western Police forwards pressed forward with their entire army. In the midst of the chaos, the Tung Wah defenders committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Standing firm, Tung Wah goalkeeper A-Lu watched the opportunity calmly. Kasha ran forward and kicked hard, aiming the ball at the left corner of the goal. A-Lu had foreseen this and had already calculated this move, diving with both hands to turn it into a corner kick. Wakenshaw then kicked a wild ball, turning danger into safety, much to the surprise. The Tung Wah players ran forward to congratulate A-Lu, all overjoyed. In the blink of an eye, Yu Tian made a crisp kick, passing to Xiao Wan, who then passed it to Li Yichen, who swept the ball into the net, making the score 3-1.</p>
<p>Solo Effort: After being severely wounded, Kasha was unwilling to give up, so he reassigned Pike to center forward, planning to make a desperate last stand, but to no effect. Suddenly, a loud cry was heard from the right flank. It was Chen Jiaqiu making a solo effort, rushing forward on horseback, dribbling past three defenses, and shooting hard at the goal. Edmon was helpless, only able to watch the incoming ball, like an arrow, shoot into the net, making the score 4-1.</p>
<p>Bullseye: By this point, Tung Wah's victory was already in their grasp, and the enemy's defense line was tired and exhausted, no longer as formidable as before. After a time of melee, there was still no progress. Pike was assisted by Hui Siwu, dribbling west, passing the penalty line, and then passing to Jackson, who passed to…</p>
<p>Duffy. Wu Youliang and Guan Xun'an rushed over, but accidentally tripped Duffy on the penalty line, resulting in a free kick. About twenty yards from the goal, Kasha made a low shot, again aiming at the left corner of the goal. A-Lu did not have the foresight to save the penalty kick, and the ball pierced the net. Not long after the kickoff, the final whistle blew.</p>

<p>China Bank Open as Usual During Winter Solstice Holiday</p>
<p>Silver Dollar and Auxiliary Coins Rates Steady</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the silver market was particularly quiet due to the customs closure and the weekly holiday. However, yesterday, only foreign banks on the Bund were closed. Among the Chinese businesses, only China Communications and Communications followed suit. The Central Bank and other Chinese banks operated as usual, so the closure of banks was different from the past. The new customs office handled import and export taxes as usual, so commercial loans circulated without hindrance. However, due to the foreign banks' closure, import transactions could not be shipped due to the inability to transfer funds. Although Chinese banks were open as usual, they were not as busy as usual. The money market also traded as usual. The morning price of foreign currency was 7 yuan 1 fen 4 li and a half, and the afternoon price was 7 yuan 1 fen 4 li 6 hao and two and a half hu. The result was a half-li improvement. The amount of exchange drafts was 855,000 in the morning and 685,000 in the afternoon. Banknotes were 45,000 in the morning and 20,000 in the afternoon. Off-exchange banknotes were 70,000 in the morning and 65,000 in the afternoon. Checks were 20,000 in the morning and 45,000 in the afternoon. Bank transactions were 500,000 in the morning and 400,000 in the afternoon. The silver dismantling rate was 2% in both the morning and afternoon. Chinese banks collected more than 4 million and stored 500,000. Money shops collected more than 5.7 million in foreign currency receipts and more than 3.1 million in silver currency receipts.

<p>Selling Pressure Strong, Investor Sentiment Weak</p>
<p>February Futures Open Today</p>
<p>This Month's Futures Trading Halted</p>
<p>Yesterday (December 26), spot trading at the Chinese Securities Exchange was generally not open in the morning, and transactions were also extremely rare in the afternoon. December futures trading was halted to settle all procedures before delivery. Only January futures were traded. However, prices plummeted and trading was particularly active. Investor sentiment was extremely weak. Many small investors sold off their holdings vigorously. Tianjin banks also sold off a considerable amount. As a result, prices fell sharply when trading opened in the morning, and the market remained weak throughout the day. There was a gradual decline with no signs of improvement. However, the local financial industry remained calm, generally engaging in purchases. The trend slightly eased in the closing session. As a result, 20 Customs, Bonds, Unified Salt Tax, and 19 Customs all fell by about 2 yuan, and others fell by about 1.5 yuan. The total daily spot trading volume was 18,000 yuan. The January futures trading volume was 3.6 million yuan in the morning and more than 2.8 million yuan in the afternoon, totaling 6.435 million yuan, of which salt tax accounted for more than 1.7 million yuan, and unified tax and 20 Customs bonds each accounted for 8-900,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The 20-year short-term financial public bonds that have been trading on the Securities Exchange for three weeks have seen extremely scarce spot circulation on the market. Due to supply and demand, prices have risen sharply. Although the highest recorded price on the exchange side is 66 yuan, the actual off-exchange settlement price has reached 72-73 yuan.</p>
<p>Most Yarn Merchants</p>
<h3 id="e191">Yarn and Cotton <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Embrace a Bullish Approach...Opinions Held...</p>
<p>Believe that the Red Market in Spring</p>
<p>Has a Great Possibility of Rising</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is slightly better, and the situation tends to be firm. Market prices initially fell and then rose. Due to the rise in raw cotton, investor sentiment is optimistic, and most speculators tend to be bullish, expecting the spring red market to recover. When the market price falls, buying interest rises. However, there are a large number of arbitrageurs, 6-7000 bales, speculating on the current month's tender yarn, selling for January and buying for February and March, earning about 6-7% interest. There are already 16-17,000 bales of 20-count yarn stockpiled in yarn warehouses, and the inventory is increasing daily.</p>
<p>(Lowest and Highest Tender Prices) The market opened before the tender. Due to reports of Japanese military disturbances in Rehe, the situation became increasingly tense, and investor sentiment fluctuated. Prices for all months fell by 6-7 qian. The 122 market gradually recovered, and as a result, prices for all months fell by 1, 2, 3, and 4 qian. It was heard in the afternoon that actual demand was sluggish, but cotton prices suddenly rose, causing yarn prices to rise. Prices for all months rose by 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 qian. The total daily transaction volume was 14,400 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 1,050 bales, Tongfu 500 bales, Gengfeng 450 bales, Shenji 300 bales, Yukang 300 bales, and Dafeng 300 bales. Xie Sheng bought 1,250 bales, Senkang 500 bales, Yiyu 500 bales, Yuda 350 bales, and Taichang 300 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>Cotton Market Advances</p>
<p>The General Environment is Conducive to Bullish Forces</p>
<p>The cotton market has turned firmer again, and most investors are optimistic. Due to the lack of spot goods and weak supply from various sources, it is rumored that a certain manufacturer's delivery volume this month is not large. The price of foreign cotton in Shanghai is still difficult to agree on. It is expected that there will still be room for price increases after the US cotton customs clearance. There is also a rising trend in the gold market. All these situations are conducive to bullish forces. As a result, the market atmosphere is tense. However, the world cotton industry is still in an era of oversupply, and the future is lacking in certainty.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Rises 3-5 qian) The market opened steadily before the Zheng Standard tender. The 23 market gradually rose, with prices for all months rising by 5 fen to 1.5 qian. There was some hedging in the afternoon. The market suddenly tightened, with prices for all months rising by 1.5 qian to 3-4 qian. The May price of 4 taels discovered a new high point. The total daily transaction volume was 56,200 dan. It was found that Changyu sold 1,900 dan, Changfeng 3,700 dan, Yuanda 3,000 dan, Gengfeng 1,300 dan, Changhe 1,200 dan, and Yifeng 1,200 dan. Xie Sheng bought 4,300 dan, Jifeng 1,400 dan, Dafu 2,100 dan, Zhenda 1,200 dan, and Yichang 2,400 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<p>(Bombay) The Indian cotton government report announced a production volume of 4,233,300 bales, a decrease of 500,000 bales compared to public forecasts. Japanese merchants' activity slightly decreased this week, but term transactions were able to be maintained due to short covering. New cotton transactions will become active after large quantities arrive. European inquiries are of a sporadic nature, and local factories are gradually increasing activity. The statistical appendix for the past week is as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1951　　　1952</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1　　297　　　558</p>
<p>Weekend inventory　　　　　　　　349　　　504</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1　357　　　298</p>

<p>Shipped to China　　　　　　　　110　　　　丨</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan　　　　　　　　166　　　189</p>
<p>Other regions　　　　　　　　　　18　　　　5</p>
<p>(Liverpool) Spot transactions were good last week. Futures trading was sluggish due to the approaching holidays. Tin prices fell slightly, and bulls took some profits. Japanese merchants and hedgers also sold, but there was a lack of speculative demand, so even with buying by the industry, it was difficult to maintain. The Egyptian cotton market was quiet and trending firm.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Grain Arrival and Brisk Sales in the Rice Market <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources are abundant, reaching over a hundred businesses. Retail sales remain flat, while wholesale sales improve. The Suzhou and Tongbang rice dealers have stagnant sales due to heavy inventory, so the situation has become weak. Fortunately, wholesale sales of thin rice have improved, and the market can still stabilize, otherwise it will also be affected by the abundant supply. The Changbang, Yinyuan, Yangdujian and other varieties remain stable.</p>
<p>(Xinzha) About twenty-five or six boats of Changzhou, Wuxi, and Xianzi rice have arrived. Sales in this street were initially sluggish but then became active. Arrivals and sales of thin rice are balanced, and the market is stable. Kunshan rice has a large inventory and the price is moderate. Yinyuan rice dealers are slightly active, and the situation continues to be strong. Arrivals and sales of Yangdujian rice are slow, and the price remains unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Kexian Rice Hoarding Becomes Active, Price Rises by One Dime <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>｜Fujian Rice Purchasing Still Strong｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of Kexian rice were not brisk, but hoarding dealers suddenly became active, and market sentiment improved, raising the price by one dime. Fujian rice purchasing remains strong, with hoarding dealers and Fujian dealers competing to purchase, making the market quite lively. However, traders from the North China regions and Guangdong, due to the arrival of Hexia rice and falling prices, have shifted their attention to Hexia japonica and indica rice. Hexia rice has a large existing inventory and a strong supply. Now that it can be re-exported, arrivals are even more abundant, and the market has fallen due to oversupply. Given the large inventory in the mainland and the good harvest, prices are unlikely to rise. Kexian rice, on the other hand, has high taxes and reduced water levels, and traders are not active. There are few arrivals in Shanghai, and once hoarding becomes active, the market is expected to improve. Yesterday, 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice were offered at prices ranging from $8.66 to $8.45, and 562 bags of Hunan machine-milled oil rice were offered at prices ranging from $8.945 to $8.75. In addition, 300 bags of red rough rice were offered at $0.74, and 78 bags of Wuhu machine-milled rice were offered at $10, which were purchased by hoarding dealers and Fujian dealers.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Spot Flour Lacks Standards, Prices Rise <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a trend of becoming firmer and more stable across all months. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were up about a dime in Chicago and about two dimes in Canada. Although the market is closed, the general sentiment is stable. Because there are only two trading days left this month, the market must be closed. Tianjin dealers have good spot sales, so spot flour is still being traded, which is why the market is optimistic. For deferred contracts, the mills are not eager to sell. Since there is no activity in the spot foreign wheat market, there are no inquiries from outside speculators. However, there is considerable buying, so the market is very strong. Later, due to some profit-taking by Fufeng and Huafeng, the situation eased slightly. The current stable trend is purely due to the lack of spot flour. Near-term flour prices are bound to rise. When foreign wheat arrives in large quantities in the future, there will naturally be changes. As a result, this month's price is up one cent from the previous week, January is up 1.75 cents, February is up 2 cents, March is up half a cent, April is up 1.25 cents, and May is up 0.75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Wheat Market Boosted by Flour Market in the Afternoon <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning, it generally showed a hovering trend. There were few transactions in each month, because there were not many chips this year. Although the market makers had been taking profits last week, the number was still small. (It is heard that the Grain Exchange will follow the flour exchange example and allow factories to use passbooks for buying and selling, with amounts ranging from 7,000 to 10,000 taels.) The transactions were not without reason. In the afternoon, trading was slightly smoother, and the market became slightly tighter. Because the flour market was rising, market sentiment was also boosted. Considering that the market will soon be closed, there will not be much fluctuation. As a result, January remained unchanged, February was up one cent, March was up two cents, and April was up one cent.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Oilseeds and Miscellaneous Grains Show Improvement <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>｜Dalian Round Beans Are More Popular｜</p>
<p>｜London Market Declines｜</p>
<p>Yesterday, the oilseed and miscellaneous grain market showed improvement, and sales by various dealers were also good. As a result, small beans are tight, broad beans are active, and Dalian round beans are particularly popular, rising four jiao compared to the previous market. Of the 600 bags of Pudong broad beans offered, both Ningbo and Guangdong dealers purchased them. Of the 272 bags of Guantian specialty Chongcai green beans, both Nanyang and Guangdong dealers purchased them. Of the 35 bags of Zhuzhen rice, Guangdong dealers purchased them exclusively. Of the 200 bags of Gaoyou green beans purchased by Fujian dealers, the largest quantity of 1,300 bags of Jiangbei soybeans and five carts of Zhengyangguan soybeans were purchased by local factories. One cart of Dalian round beans was purchased by a local garden workshop. The white sesame market was also strong, with 148 bags of Guantian high-quality white sesame and 148 bags of Tushan white sesame all being purchased by local dealers. 100 bags of Nanjing white sesame were purchased by Guangdong dealers. Yangzhuang offered 240 bags of Bengbu white sesame and 281 bags of Guzhen clean sesame. The prices of peanuts and raw kernels also rose by a small amount. The buyers were local and Guangdong dealers. 300 bags of Shuanggou peanuts and 99 bags of Zhongxing peanuts were purchased by local dealers, while 120 tons of Shandong raw kernels and 100 bags of Tancheng raw kernels were all purchased by Guangdong dealers. In the oil market, raw oil prices rose slightly, while soybean oil was stable and did not fluctuate much. Furthermore, according to a London dispatch on the 24th, Chinese soybeans fell slightly, at £7 per ton (equivalent to 5.1 taels per 100 catties).</p>
<h3 id="e200">Sugar Market: Red and White Sugar Prices Rise Again <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>24 Coarse Granulated White Sugar Rises 7.5 Cents</p>
<p>Chaozhou Green Ground Price Rises 3-4 Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market suddenly tightened due to increased demand from purchasing households. In the morning, Changxing offered over 2,000 bags of 24 coarse granulated white sugar at $15.75. In the afternoon, Changxing offered another 1,000 bags at the exchange, with the price rising again to $15.8, up 7.5 cents from the previous day. The market for medium granulated white Huaxin goods was even tighter. The 20th was still offered at $15, and the 18th was quoted at $14.8, but no deal was made. Dutch red 8 was at $11.7, 9 was at $11.9, and 10 was at $12. The market was strong. Zhenxin Factory's newly produced Qibai in Shanghai was offered at $14.9 yesterday for several hundred bags, and later rose to $15. Of the 700-plus bags of new Chaozhou green that arrived the day before yesterday, over 500 bags were offered yesterday at prices ranging from $9 to $8.6. However, there were no goods of Gaoti Zhuangqing, and the price was about $9.2, so it had already risen by 2 jiao compared to the previous market. Furthermore, according to a Shantou dispatch, recent arrivals in Shantou have risen by 3-4 jiao. Tianjin Qing was offered again yesterday for 60 bags at prices ranging from $9.85 to $9.5, a slight increase from before.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Northern Goods: Longkou Vermicelli Arrivals Increase, Turning to Decline <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Longkou vermicelli has become sluggish because the Hesheng ship arrived with over 3,000 bags the day before yesterday, and inventory has suddenly become sufficient. The market is sluggish, and traders are offering at $18.6. Market prices have also fallen by 2 jiao. Yesterday, the market was quoted at $18.8, and the trend is weak.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Seafood and Raw Flour Sales are Brisk <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>｜Abundant Production of Cuttlefish, but Sluggish Sales｜</p>
<p>(Raw Flour) Recently, business for Guangdong dealers has gradually become active. Places such as Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and Guangdong are gradually consuming supplies, so the merchants' inventory is gradually being depleted, and each stall's sales are tightening. Yesterday, the market price was: True Fei Qilin brand at $8.85, Deer brand at $8.25, Green Pagoda, Three Fish, and National Flag brands at $6.1, and Three Shrimp Handprint at $4.05. With the inventory already low, the market is particularly brisk. If sales to customers do not decrease, there may be a further rise.</p>
<p>(Cuttlefish) This year's cuttlefish production in various regions is said to be abundant. However, sales are unusually sluggish, resulting in oversupply. The streets are full of inventory, and the market is difficult to improve. Currently, Ningyang large is sold at $28, Shengshan goods at $23, ordinary goods at around $20, and lower-quality goods can be purchased for $15-16.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Piece Goods: Huate呢 Vary in Strength <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Huate呢 (woolen fabric) is very tight, but the market price varies in strength, as winter sales vary in briskness and are related to the amount of inventory in the market. Yesterday, Monday, checkered Huate呢 was the most popular, because there were no arrivals and the market lacked inventory. Plain dark gray Huate呢 was also in good condition, as it is suitable for cold weather sales, but prices were only slightly better, because the inventory was sufficient, so it was difficult to follow the rise. Colored Huate呢 supply and demand were equal, so there were no gains or losses. Because shimmering colors are not suitable for the season, they have mostly weakened.</p>

<p>— Ye Lingfeng</p>
<p>After taking two more puffs of her cigarette, she walked to the open window and threw the half-inch long cigarette out of the window into the empty air.</p>
<p>A little vermilion spark traced an arc in the air.</p>
<p>She walked back to the box in the corner. A pair of brown-black eyes peered at me from under her hat: "If you don't mind, I want to change my clothes."</p>
<p>"Do you want me to go outside?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No need, just turn your face away." She was already taking off her black velvet coat.</p>
<p>I walked to the window. The October mist was dressing the city in a greyish-white sleeping gown. Two streetlights blinked like yellow eyes.</p>
<p>A few soft rustling sounds, followed by a shoe being dropped on the floor, then another.</p>
<p>"Okay, sorry to bother you."</p>
<p>I turned around. She had already taken off her hat and changed into casual blue velvet clothes, her chest open, revealing the scarlet camisole underneath, and slippers on her feet.</p>
<p>For the first time, I saw two brown-black eyeballs in her small face.</p>
<p>Her dark blue figure framed by a patch of red under her chin, I laughed and said,</p>

<p>She smiled and started to fasten the buttons on her chest. "He liked me wearing this red shirt. There are many hobbies that you men have that we don't understand. Don't you think so?"</p>
<p>I nodded and picked up my hat. I said, "Mary might be back soon. I have to go." She looked at me:</p>
<p>"Can you tell me where you live?" I took out the "Black Cat Brand" cigarettes I had just bought from my pocket, tore off a little paper, wrote the address on it, and handed it to her with the cigarettes.</p>
<p>"Thank you." She walked me to the door. "When I first saw you, I knew you and I were the same kind of person. Do you believe he will come back?"</p>
<p>I said, "I believe it, I believe it."</p>
<p>I put on my hat, sighed silently, and left.</p>

<p>The next evening, after handling the funeral arrangements for a lonely friend who had been sick for seven months, I did not go to the small restaurant for dinner, and did not return to my apartment until two o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>After getting out of the car, the White Russian night watchman saw me from the glass door, stood up and opened the door for me.</p>
<p>"GoodNightSirl"</p>
<p>"GOODNightl" I touched my hat.</p>
<p>I got into the elevator, and the elevator operator said, "You're back, sir."</p>
<p>I said, "I'm back."</p>
<p>The elevator took me to the seventh floor. Seeing me return, the No. 11 tea boy greeted me and said:</p>
<p>"Sir, a female guest came to see you tonight."</p>
<p>"What's her name?" I asked. I never had a female guest come to see me.</p>
<p>"She didn't say. She waited for a long time and left a letter."</p>
<p>He handed me a letter.</p>
<p>Looking at the unfamiliar, clumsy handwriting on the public envelope, I tore it open with a "嗤" sound.</p>
<p>Written on the stationery in slanting pencil strokes: "I came to see you. Why didn't you come to dinner? This afternoon I found him on the street, but he ignored me. Do you believe he will come back? I still believe it! Swallow."</p>
<h3 id="e224">"Suicide" and "Being Killed" <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Today, after reading Yu Dafu's "On Death and Suicide, Love Suicide, and the Like" published in this journal, I thought of the suicide incidents of Japanese people that I saw in Japanese newspapers. It was three years ago when I was in Kyoto, Japan, that I saw an astonishing suicide event reported in the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun. The deceased was a man with a family and property, neither for love failure nor for bankruptcy in speculation, but simply because he was sick and felt that he could no longer live as a healthy person, so he took the means of suicide. He first killed his wife and one son and one daughter (the wife's suicide was probably agreed upon), and this person suffering from a chronic disease locked the door of his house, went to the bank to withdraw a portion of his savings, roamed for a month, and then called his brother who was working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo, explaining the "tragedy" of his whole family, and then he himself committed suicide next to the corpses of his wife and children.</p>
<p>This is a kind of suicide with an abnormal psychology, but behind the abnormal psychology, we see a healthy heart jumping there: this is the serious and earnest attitude towards life, without the slightest willingness to be perfunctory! Since one cannot live as a healthy person, since one cannot fulfill the obligations that healthy people should fulfill, then one might as well commit suicide! ! ! It was this touching will of unwillingness to waste one's life that drove this chronically ill person with a family and property onto the road of suicide!</p>
<p>I curse suicide. However, I am only moved by the suicide of this chronically ill person! Can we criticize such a serious attitude towards life? If he did not have that incurable chronic disease, then he must have been a very brave warrior in the struggle of life, right? If a nation has such a serious attitude towards life, this nation must be inviolable, right?</p>
<p>It is not only the Japanese nation that has this serious and earnest attitude towards life; I just happened to give an example of a Japanese person. Moreover, we should not misunderstand that the Japanese imperialist's barbarous military aggression has any causal relationship with the Japanese people's serious attitude towards life. No! Those are completely two different things! But conversely, a nation without this serious attitude towards life cannot avoid being invaded and not daring to resist, often crying out national humiliation but only having five minutes of enthusiasm. The general middle class in our society who call themselves the backbone are the most lacking in that serious and earnest attitude towards life! Therefore, the funds for the reconstruction of the Zhabei disaster area must be raised by means of lotteries, so relief for Northeastern refugees must be done by holding variety shows, and using movie stars, dancers, and famous prostitutes to call for donations! Therefore, only the poor and suffering people who have always been despised are resisting Japanese imperialism in the freezing cold!</p>
<p>A serious and earnest attitude towards life, without the slightest willingness to live in ease! If one cannot righteously be a person useful to society and mankind, then one might as well die! If one cannot righteously live a rational human life, then one might as well fight to the death! This should be our banner, our creed!</p>
<p>Because those who live in a drunken dream will sooner or later "be killed" even if they are unwilling to "commit suicide"!</p>
<h3 id="e225">On Veneration of Foolishness <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Qifan</p>
<p>The blessings of foolish people have long been discovered by predecessors, and some people are very envious of them. The view that "knowing words is the beginning of worries in life" contains this tendency. But in these words, there is still a hidden boast that one is superior to the foolish masses, without knowing the various virtues of foolish people, nor ever thinking that foolishness can indeed be venerated. Therefore, although one is envious of foolish people, one is still unwilling to be a foolish person oneself, so these words become a general empty phrase. What is even more ridiculous is that those who consider themselves intelligent, knowing the pitiable nature of their own situation, still cast a pitying eye on foolish people, in order to satisfy their sense of superiority and to numb themselves.</p>
<p>Foolish people do not know anything. They certainly do not care whether others pity them or envy them, nor do they know what their own situation and position are. All they can see are the things in front of them. They lack foresight, they have no plans or programs, they only know how to do things, and to implement them in a practical and realistic manner. They never consider whether things are dangerous or have no hope of success; they do not do things after predicting that they will definitely succeed, because they have no concern for success and failure. The resistance to Japan by the volunteer armies in various parts of the Northeast is an expression of this kind of foolish spirit.</p>
<p>Slightly intelligent people will never use a few thousand people with insufficient supplies and dilapidated equipment to confront the military power of the entire country of Japan. Very intelligent people would never dare to engage in a short battle with Japanese soldiers with hundreds of thousands of soldiers. People of great wisdom and great intelligence will naturally not act rashly without a 10% chance of winning. Foolish people cannot see this at all. Their failures are also self-inflicted. Fortunately, they do not regard one or a few failures as a great shame and humiliation. Their foolishness enables them to continue to work hard on these unfinished matters. The so-called "hard work, reckless work, stupid work, desperate work until the end" is the consistent spirit of foolishness.</p>
<p>The word "foolish" is often followed by the word "stubborn." Foolish without being stubborn does not constitute foolishness. Only when one is foolish to the point of being incorrigible can one have the true value of foolishness. Some scientists spend their entire lives studying the ecology of a parasite, some scientists spend their entire lives observing the movement of a planet, and some scientists spend decades of effort inventing the use of a gear. It is really not worth it when you think about it, but the preciousness of foolishness lies in this.</p>
<p>In our country, there are too many intelligent people and too few foolish people, so there are only more leaders, alliance leaders, masters, and patriarchs in all aspects, and a lack of believers and implementers. As a result, it has caused wars between leaders and alliance leaders, and enemies between patriarchs and masters, with hundreds of disputes arising before anything is accomplished.</p>
<p>If these people were originally intelligent and had the talents of leaders and alliance leaders, then there would still be something to say, and it would not be a complete injustice. It is a pity that these heads, brains, tops, and elites in China are not necessarily all inherently extremely intelligent. On the contrary, there are indeed many who are very foolish and clumsy, but they also pretend to be very serious and boast of themselves, resulting in hundreds of jokes and a muddle-headed mess, which is really a bit tragic.</p>
<p>To change this shortcoming, the only way is to promote the method of venerating foolishness. In the past, we were too disrespectful to foolish people, so everyone wanted to become intelligent people. As a result, there were too many intelligent people, and things became stagnant. Now, the only way is to raise the position of foolishness above intelligence, hoping that those who are not originally intelligent will continue to do foolish work, and also hoping that those who are originally intelligent will participate in a little foolish work. If this is the case, then it can be hoped that there will be fewer leaders and talents in society who talk empty words and boast, and more implementers who seek truth from facts, and then gradually form a glimmer of dawn for the future. 12.25</p>
<h3 id="e226">Cosmic Rays <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Haitian</p>
<p>A new natural phenomenon has attracted people's attention for many years. This is "cosmic rays." Many scientists who study it do not yet have a consistent opinion. However, regarding the source of this mysterious light, everyone seems to agree that it comes from outside the Earth, not from the Earth itself. As for the nature of this light, from what place or what direction it is emitted, whether it comes from other stars, or from within our own solar system, these questions still need to be researched for some time.</p>
<p>Cosmic rays are stronger than X-rays. Thick lead plates that X-rays cannot penetrate can be penetrated by cosmic rays. It can also penetrate deep into lakes. Scientists have put the most sophisticated instruments into the lake to capture this cosmic radiation. It can only not be captured at the very bottom of the lake. Deep water can block the path of cosmic rays, so people speculate that the thick layer of air surrounding the Earth must also absorb it considerably. The higher one goes into the sky, the stronger the cosmic radiation should be.</p>
<p>This summer, Belgian scientist Professor Piccard ascended into the stratosphere at 53,600 feet in a balloon, hoping to measure stronger cosmic radiation than on the Earth's surface below the air layer. But contrary to his and many other scientists' expectations, there was no perceived increase, but rather it seemed to decrease somewhat. Piccard believes that air is the medium of light. The light and heat from the sun must pass through the medium of air in order to emit light and heat. In a vacuum, light and heat have no effect. Therefore, there is less cosmic radiation in the high sky than on the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>What is the use of cosmic rays is not yet known. Thousands of years ago, the ancients rubbed amber to produce small sparks, but unexpectedly this was the electricity of modern civilization. After we know the nature of cosmic rays, they may be more useful than electricity.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Impressions of Suzhou <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenfu</p>
<p>(1) Suzhou, A Dream of Three Lives of Flowers and Plants</p>
<p>The two words "Suzhou" have been lingering in my mind for a very long time. What a lovely term this is! What a term that makes people love and admire it! When we think of these two words, we immediately associate them with the character "Xi" on the Gusu Terrace, Yuan Yuan by the Hengtang River, what a glamorous view of Guanqian Street, and how wonderful is the towering Tianping Mountain; it has its swirling scenery in history, and even more dreams that make people love and admire in name. As the saying goes, "Above there is heaven, below there are Suzhou and Hangzhou," if we only look at its bright side, this may be believable, right?</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, I once traveled with my father on a small inland river steamer. One of the passengers on the ship was an old lady from Suzhou. Although Father Time ruthlessly deprived her of her youthful beauty, and her forehead was carved with deep lines of wrinkles made by the axe of time, the amazing, moving, and endearing features were still maintained on this old lady. When she spoke, a gentle and slow, Suzhou accent with a special style was still maintained. When I heard her speak for the first time, how amazed and delighted I was to listen to this lovely accent, as lovely as music? This was the first time I heard a Suzhou person speak. Even after more than ten years now, I still cannot forget it, how great her magic is! This is not just my boasting. Isn't the "soft language of Wu" recognized by society?</p>
<p>Yuan is my closest classmate, and he is exactly "A Nong was born and grew up in Suzhou," which of course made me even more fond of him. Since I had a deep friendship with Yuan, I have had a personal understanding of Suzhou people, which has further increased my love for Suzhou. Once, in a poem I gave to Yuan, there were two lines: "A kind of gentleness passed down from the Qiantang River, a dream of three lives of beauty to Suzhou," the previous line was thinking of my friends in my hometown, and the next line refers to Yuan. Later, when I read Gong Ding'an's poems, there were several love poems for a Suzhou woman, although he was vaguely unwilling to say it clearly. One of them is "A dream of three lives of flowers and plants to Suzhou," which coincides with my poem; it can also be seen that Suzhou does have a place that makes people love and admire it, not just my ravings. What follows is a reminiscence of my faint impressions of this trip to Suzhou.</p>
<p>(2) Ancient Sites in Withered Landscape Mourning Tiger Hill</p>
<p>I was actually visiting the "Suzhou that I love but cannot see, scratching my head and hesitating" with Yuan as my guide. What a comforting thing this is! When we asked for leave from school, the sky was cloudy and gloomy, but the smile in our hearts was not dampened by it; we were not afraid that the sky would rain and stop our travel mood, even if it really rained, we would travel in the rain, and there would be a special kind of charm that others would not want to appreciate. We were moving forward quickly with this mentality. We took the afternoon train from Wuxi, arrived at Suzhou Station, got off the train, and then went along the railway to Tiger Hill.</p>
<p>On the road: the not very wide streets, the old-fashioned houses, the children's works painted on the walls saying "Down with So-and-So," are not very different from my hometown; no, they are almost the same as the situations everywhere, but a few ancestral halls and a few stone memorial archways indicate that this is a place of outstanding people and spirits. This is the situation outside Suzhou City, which still preserves the original Chinese appearance and has not been modernized. When the yellow walls and the golden and brilliant title plaque of the Tiger Hill Temple shone into our eyes, our destination had arrived. We walked into the temple gate, and there were many trees on both sides, already with some desolate artistic conception, indicating that it was already late autumn. In the midst of weeds and overgrown grass, there are many tombs, isolated pavilions, and broken steles. If we explore them from a historical perspective, there may be many touching and lamentable things contained in them, but we are just tourists who have come for the sake of enjoyment, so naturally we have no time to verify them for him. On the left, there is a newly built pavilion with a stone tablet erected, recording the story of a filial son named Zhang who was burned to death while saving his mother. There are inscriptions by famous people from Suzhou. This filial son Zhang was a poor Jiangbei person, a Jiangbei person who was despised by people, but he was able to occupy a place in this famous Tiger Hill and be worshiped. The filial son in the ground can also be comforted. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Nonsense! No manners at all! Luckily, Mr. Lin and Mr. Liao are not strangers."</p>
<p>"Wife and slave are not synonyms! Mr. Liao! Right?"</p>
<p>Madam Cao stretched her neck, tilted her head, made a half-grimace, and went to the other side. Cao Haiquan thought, this is truly a modern woman.</p>
<p>In the end, it was still because the revolution had not yet succeeded, and a woman is still a woman. Madam Cao finally succumbed to Cao Shiguang. She came to the church alone and returned from the church alone.</p>
<p>After watching his wife's lonely figure disappear, Cao Shiguang turned his head towards Lin and Liao as if completely numb.</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<p>"But I'm not free at eight o'clock."</p>
<p>Haiquan quickly stated.</p>
<p>"Is there anything important? Why don't we have a good time tonight?"</p>
<p>"I have an appointment at eight o'clock, I can't break my promise."</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter."</p>
<p>"How is it that you in the religious world don't value credit?"</p>
<p>"It's just hanging up a signboard."</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang's attitude was quite innocent and straightforward, only Liao Haifeng remained silent.</p>
<p>"Although I haven't been baptized, I must keep my word."</p>
<p>Haiquan said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin is right."</p>
<p>Mr. Liao also smiled.</p>
<p>"Then, let's go to the restaurant first. There's still an hour and a half, is there not enough time?"</p>
<p>Cao Shiguang paid for the tram fare from the church to the S restaurant on K Road. They ordered a two-dollar set meal at the restaurant. Originally, everyone was a bit hungry, and eating would have been fine. Cao Shiguang kept clamoring to drink old wine, so they ordered half a catty of aged Hua Diao. He poured and drank it himself.</p>
<p>After a while, the food was finished. The waiter brought three hot towels.</p>
<p>"Lao Cao, let me make a phone call to check on that matter."</p>
<p>Mr. Liao took the towel, wiped his mouth, and walked out. Cao Shiguang held the hot towel, wiped his face, and then carefully wiped his hands. A black mark had already stained the snow-white towel.</p>
<p>"Lao Lin, please sit for a while, I'll go take a leak."</p>
<p>He walked inside.</p>

<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>Why do we study, to become officials? To get rich? True, our parents probably want us to graduate from school! High school graduates are like Xiucai, middle school graduates are like Juren, and university graduates are like Hanlin, just like in the Qing Dynasty imperial examination era, seeking golden houses in officialdom. But we, the young and determined, will never somersault in this evil thought. However, in today's society, most people believe that becoming an official is the best shortcut to a comfortable life. Since humans tend to seek pleasure and avoid suffering, and since humans tend to choose less labor and more comfort, and since becoming an official is a very profitable business, how is it possible to prevent people from tending towards it? Look at Zhang San, who was originally a teacher in a primary school, earning only a little over ten yuan a month, not enough to support his parents or raise his wife and children. Friends and relatives all regarded him as a useless person, looked down on him, and ridiculed him, causing him to lose the joy of life. So he became indignant, abandoned his pen and joined the army. Before long, he graduated from a military academy, and went to work in a certain army. He immediately wore a small leather belt on his shoulder, and tied leggings around his legs, looking like a proud military officer! So this one called him Battalion Commander, that one called him Sir. Relatives respected him, friends admired him. Although what he learned was the game of feeding cannons with flesh, and what he did was harming others without benefiting himself, he earned gold and silver every month. From then on, his parents were addressed as Old Master and Old Madam, and his wife was addressed as Madam. Not only did he not have to worry about food and clothing, but he could also join the ranks of the wealthy! Who wouldn't envy him? Look at Li Si, he was originally a cunning rogue, who made a living by deception all day long. But because the times are times that create heroes, those with heroic talents will naturally enter the realm of heroes, Long live so-and-so! Down with so-and-so! Look! He is now a formidable big shot! When the army came, the locality was ravaged, the people were slaughtered, and society was in chaos, but his destiny had been made! So Mr. Li also became a meritorious servant of society. From then on, he could glorify his ancestors, live in Western-style houses, ride in cars, eat delicacies, and embrace beautiful concubines. Who wouldn't want to taste such heavenly bliss? To be honest, in this world, what better business is there than getting promoted and getting rich? You want others to embark on the path of knowledge with more suffering than joy, only madmen will listen to you!</p>
<p>Is this truly everyone's feeling? True, most of the smart people in the world think this way, but we must know that madmen are the driving force that propels the wheels of society forward. The progress of modern society has all been created by a few madmen. Think about it, the person who invented pottery burned all the furniture in his house, even the bed he slept on, for experimental purposes. Isn't this the behavior of a madman? The person who invented the airplane made some gadgets, sat on them himself, braved the danger, and soared in the air like a bird. Isn't this the behavior of a madman? Those who study knowledge bury themselves in the laboratory all day long, from youth to old age, and all they get is a few truths that ordinary people think are insignificant. How can they compare to high officials whose doors are crowded and whose names are resounding? This is naturally also a madman! The rest, such as explorers and revolutionaries who disregard their lives, needless to say, are madmen! Ladies and gentlemen! Where is the reason for China's backwardness? It's because there are too few madmen and too many smart people!</p>

<p>Santa Claus probably understands "the philosophy of life": So every year when the cold winter season of Christmas comes, the old man, dressed in red, braves the snow, and is sure to bring many gifts to give to people: candy, cakes, toys: he carries a big bag full of them, hunches his back, and stumbles to the world to give gifts. Foreigners are very happy on this Christmas holiday!! Especially children, who hold banquets and celebrate Christmas: they light candles on the tree, which look like trees of fire and silver flowers, very bright and pleasing to the eye, and are called "Christmas Trees." On this day, they eat turkey and beef, which they call "Holy Meat:" they drink wine, which they call "Holy Blood:" they sing and dance, spending this Christmas night in great revelry! During our Chinese Winter Solstice, everyone eats tangyuan and rice cakes to get a good omen: at night, there is also the superstition of seeking dreams. The customs of the East and West are different after all.</p>
<p>I think our countrymen, sleep on that day</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>of the night, | Winter Solstice Night | are sure to have dreams. But dreams are different for everyone. Most people must dream of golden ingots rolling into their arms. Perhaps some people dream of becoming officials, ordering people around, being full of prestige, having beautiful wives and concubines, fertile fields and luxurious houses, and achieving the goal of wealth and status. Some are dreaming of buying up enemy goods, and their business is booming, and they are about to get rich, when suddenly a bomb comes and awakens their good dream. Perhaps some young people are dreaming of embracing their lovers, making vows of eternal love, and being very sweet, when suddenly a rival in love comes, pulls out a pistol, aims at them, and all they hear is a "bang" in their ears, scaring them awake, and it turns out to be a dream of Nanke.·······</p>
<p>Our countrymen, after having "Winter Solstice Illusions," are followed by the foreign Winter Solstice, | Christmas | that tactless Santa Claus, who is going to give gifts again. What are Santa Claus's gifts? They are neither candy, nor toys, nor the ruthless bombs of the ××× group, but a warm conscience. Santa Claus gives this because our countrymen lack this thing; therefore, they don't put the country in their hearts, and don't care whether the country is destroyed, only knowing to desperately buy enemy goods, import enemy goods, cause trouble, and bring disaster upon themselves: so he doesn't send other things, only this warm conscience. I wonder if our compatriots like to accept it?</p>
<p>Alas! Santa Claus! Why did you give the Northeast Three Provinces to the Japanese as a gift? We have accepted your gift of conscience, and we still have to snatch this gift back from their hands. Everyone, get up quickly!</p>

<p>Life is like a journey through the desert, with more hurricanes and less water and grass: it is only meaningful if people can resist the hurricanes and find water and grass.</p>
<p>Life is like playing cards. Getting good cards is like being born into a wealthy family. Getting bad cards is like being born into a poor family. If you are a friend with empty hands at home, even if you try your best, you might be able to make a big hand, but it's very difficult after all! Also, the nouveau riche, the rich who get rich by improper means, are like friends with a living hand, making a big hand.</p>
<p>The wealthy old men live in seclusion, and although they have grand mansions, what is the difference between them and the taste of iron windows? When they go out, with cars in front and behind, and bodyguards on the left and right, aren't they like police and soldiers monitoring robbers?</p>
<p>Zhang Zongchang had more than 13 million yuan in savings, all of which were confiscated by the Japanese. Once he died, more than a dozen beautiful concubines each went their separate ways, and each only received two thousand several hundred yuan. I wonder what the friends who specialize in extortion think about this?</p>

<p>I heard that Minister ×× recently bought several police dogs in the United States, worth about several thousand yuan: and also hired two teachers for them, who train them all day long: the teachers' monthly salary is also several hundred yuan each. After hearing this, I dare not believe it's true: if it is true, then it really is "it is better to be a dog than a man!"</p>
<p>The government's proposition is to first secure the internal situation and then deal with external enemies. Now that the communist bandits have been pacified, I think they will soon swear an oath to march out of the customs. As long as they are determined to resist, why fear the Japanese invaders!</p>
<p>There used to be a four-character couplet, called "Soil can produce gold, the land does not begrudge treasures:" I didn't expect that both sentences have now become a reality. Now that ×× is publicly sold, isn't it soil producing gold? Not recovering the lost land, isn't that the land not begrudging treasures?</p>
<p>Now, to fall in love, there must be two prerequisite questions: First, "Do you have money?" Second, "Are you beautiful?" All other knowledge and character are irrelevant. I'm just afraid that poor and ugly people will not be able to marry wives in the future, and will have to embrace bachelorhood permanently.</p>
<p>The law clearly stipulates that having illicit relations with a woman under the age of twenty should be a crime; but in society, there are often formal marriages with teenage girls, why isn't this considered a crime?</p>
<p>It is most difficult to be a person in society. If you are humble to others, some people will say you are flattering; if you are arrogant to others, some people will say you are conceited; if your clothes are gorgeous, they will say you are extravagant; if you dress shabbily: they will say you are poor and cold: Absolutely strictly speaking, it is impossible to find a person who suits everyone's wishes.</p>
<p>When you see someone riding in a car, even if you have no relatives or friends, you can recognize them as relatives and friends: when you see three beggars, even if they are really your uncles, you will definitely treat them as strangers.</p>
<p>No matter what organization, the more money you get, the more leisurely your work must be; the less money you get, the more laborious your work is.</p>

<p>Enveloped in angry and indignant emotions, I begin to ask a serious question, requesting you to provide a suitable answer, and please publish it in your publication for public criticism. The following are the facts of the matter:</p>
<p>My deceased friend, Mr. Pan, was a tenacious and hardworking young man. He and I graduated from ×× Middle School last autumn. At that time, the flames of youth were burning; the prospects for the future were active. We looked down on everything and each carried our diplomas, striding out of school and beginning to attack this mysterious society. I apparently won, but Pan lost his job! During this long period of unemployment, Mr. Pan recognized the true face of this society. He was so pessimistic that he almost committed suicide!</p>
<p>Later, through a friend's introduction, he met Mr. Jia, who worked at ×× Foreign Company. Through Mr. Jia's introduction, Mr. Pan obtained a position as a small clerk at ×× Foreign Company. Mr. Jia had a very high position in this foreign company, and almost all the Chinese staff were under his management. At that time, when Mr. Pan entered this foreign company, the manager (a Westerner) set his monthly salary at thirty-five taels, but Mr. Jia, considering himself meritorious for the introduction, deducted twenty yuan from Mr. Pan's monthly salary as a reward for the introduction. At the same time, he ordered Mr. Pan not to disclose this secret. Mr. Pan, fearing his power, dared to be angry but dared not speak out. Mr. Jia, seeing that Mr. Pan could be bullied, gave Mr. Pan the busiest work, making him work from eight in the morning to seven in the evening before letting him go home, using this to show off his achievements in front of outsiders, to boast that he had recommended the right person.</p>
<p>Mr. Jia was good at making money. Not only did he exploit lower-level staff to enrich himself, but he also founded a night school for the purpose of making money in his spare time, and asked Mr. Pan to help teach in his night school every night, only reimbursing Mr. Pan five yuan per semester for transportation expenses. This was simply making him do his duty, because he only received eight cents a month for two hours of teaching work every day! Mr. Pan, fearing his power, could only endure and accept his exploitation!</p>
<p>Mr. Pan bore fourteen hours of strenuous work every day, operating like a cow or horse, and Mr. Pan's labor reward was almost completely exploited by Mr. Jia. Thus, a striving, promising, and vigorous young man was ground down to a state of exhaustion and listlessness!</p>
<p>This summer, I accidentally met Mr. Pan on the road, and I almost couldn't believe that my old friend, whom I had been separated from for only half a year, had become so shockingly thin. So he told me about his recent situation. I had no choice but to sigh. I advised him that he would rather lose his job than take care of his health. But Mr. Pan said sadly: "I have tasted the taste of unemployment, and perhaps unemployment is even more painful than being exploited!" We quietly parted in such helpless silence. Now, after several months of separation, I suddenly heard the bad news of Mr. Pan's death from former classmates. It is said that half of the disease that caused his death was due to overwork; the other half was due to depression in his heart!</p>
<p>The unexpected stimulus ignited a cavity of anger in me. I finally couldn't restrain my tense emotions and prepared to avenge Mr. Pan. But Mr. Pan was not shot to death by Mr. Jia, and I cannot file a legal lawsuit. Moreover, Mr. Pan is already dead. He has no evidence to support the grievances he suffered during his lifetime, and Mr. Jia is now also working as a lawyer. Obviously, I cannot use the law to punish him. I also considered using a negative method to expose Mr. Jia's privacy to damage his reputation, but the method is too despicable. I am unwilling to sacrifice my personality as a condition for avenging my old friend. I have been wandering like this for several months, and I still cannot find a way to avenge Mr. Pan. Smart editor, smart readers, please sympathize with this unjustly dead small clerk, stand on a just position, and give me a suitable answer.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Zhongjie December 21st</p>
<p>Editor's Note: After reading this sad and angry letter, we felt as if our hearts were burning, and we expressed the same sympathy and grief for Mr. Pan as Mr. Zhongjie. A promising young man like Mr. Pan was sacrificed in this bad environment by the shameless and selfish Mr. Jia!</p>
<p>But we should know: The occurrence of this kind of thing is the result of a bad social system. It's not just Mr. Pan who has been sacrificed in this bad environment; it's not just Mr. Jia who is a sinister person in society. Therefore, we believe that this is a problem of the whole society, and we should start from the root to seek the overall reform.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan has been sacrificed, and he cannot be resurrected! We feel that thinking for the living is more urgent than avenging the dead; therefore, for the shameless, selfish people like Mr. Jia, we should unanimously criticize them, not obey, not compromise, seek benefits for the entire group of people, and seek happiness for the entire society; with a spirit of fearlessness, strive forward; never give up, and must make this kind of scum of humanity disappear from society before we are done.</p>
<p>In addition to sympathy and grief, we still want to regret Mr. Pan, and have to regret Mr. Pan's wrong concept at the time. We believe that rather than submitting to preserve oneself and working like a dog all day long, suffering the oppression of shameless and selfish people to the point of death; why not jump out of the fire pit and would rather lose one's job and fight to the death with shameless and selfish people!</p>
<p>Our method of avenging Mr. Pan is to promote the reform of the social system, so that people like Mr. Jia have no place to live. As for the personal handling of Mr. Jia, although legal proceedings cannot be initiated due to "lack of evidence"; what's the harm in making his bad deeds public? This will not only eliminate the evil spirit in our hearts; it can also prevent those who approach him from being fooled by him again. How can this kind of chivalrous act be considered "despicable"? How can it "lose personality"?</p>
<p>The emotion of hating evil like an enemy made us say the above a lot; but let's calm down and study the cause of Mr. Pan's death.</p>
<p>According to the letter, Mr. Pan died because of "accumulated labor becoming a disease" and "depression in his heart." This kind of cause is the most common in society. There are also two ways to solve it: ㈠ is to be optimistic in everything: No matter how busy the work is, no matter how difficult the environment is, always deal with it with an optimistic attitude. ㈡ is to pay attention to physical education; regarding this point, we have already said roughly in the article "Running into the Store and Ruining Your Body" in this column on the 24th of this month, readers can refer to it. We believe that if these two points can be implemented, then there will naturally be no depression in the heart, and accumulated labor will not become a disease.</p>
<p>Dear readers: After reading the above facts, what do you think? Is there a better way to deal with people like Mr. Jia? Is there a concrete plan for reforming the social system? I hope everyone will study it and express their great views.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>"People like you should be liberated first." Wang Lao'er put his pipe in his mouth, stared at him with wide eyes, and said, "What, build a house?</p>
<p>? We till other people's fields, so naturally we have the landlord's house to live in, what's the point of building a house? I wouldn't build a house even if I had money. As the saying goes, 'If you don't get along with people, advise them to raise geese, if you don't get along with people, advise them to build houses.'" Meng Guobao didn't expect that what he was talking about was so far away from what he had expected, so he smiled and said, "I don't mean that." As he said that, he walked into the house with him. Wang Lao'er's house was five rooms, half tile and half grass. The central hall was thatched roofed. The grass heads under the eaves were like the silk tassels of a glass lamp. Such eaves surrounded a square courtyard of five feet on all sides. Naturally, it seemed that the courtyard was too big. A big spider web was hung in the corner of the house. In the hall, a table more than two feet high was leaning against the loess wall. A small broom made of bundled rice straw was placed on the table. Wang Lao'er took it and wiped the table, laughing, "Mr. Meng! Please sit down for a while, I'm really sorry!" Then he raised his head and said to the house, "Don't take care of these chickens, they've pooped all over the table." Meng Guobao saw that there were indeed a few wet marks on the table. He took out a small stool one foot high from the side of the table and sat down. He looked at the loess walls around and sighed, "Lao Er, I'm very ashamed!" Wang Lao'er tapped the head of his dry cigarette pipe on the edge of the table twice, knocking out the ashes. He tilted his head and pondered, seeming very surprised by his words. He looked at him and said, "Sir, what are you talking about?" Meng Guobao said: "Think about it! I dress better than you, eat better than you, and I don't have to work hard at all. You work hard all year round, but you live in such a house." Wang Lao'er laughed loudly and said, "Mr. Meng, you're really talking silly! You eat well, dress well, and don't have to work hard, that's what you cultivated in your previous life, what are you ashamed of?" Meng Guobao thought, this is really terrible! No matter what I say, he doesn't understand anything. However, this is not only Wang Lao'er, but also the people in my family are like this. It's really not an easy thing for someone to engage in the liberation of peasants and workers. The teacher in the classroom only tells us to start with liberating ourselves, what kind of liberation is mine? Alas! They don't understand anything, what can I say?</p>

<h3 id="e236">Trivial Matters of "The Bird of Paradise" <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>｜BirdofParadise</p>
<p>If you say this article is praising "The Bird of Paradise," I readily admit it: "The Bird of Paradise" indeed has many praiseworthy merits and facts.</p>
<p>㈠ Material Sacrifice</p>
<p>In January and February of this year, I read a piece of news in a report from the American film industry, roughly saying that Mr. King Vidor, director of RKO Pictures in America, and Ms. Dolores Del Rio, a female star, led three photographers to Hawaii to capture the background of "The Bird of Paradise." In Hawaii, they stayed at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel for more than two months. Upon returning to the United States, they presented their achievements: over one hundred landscape photos. Although it is said that the beauty of Hawaii's mountains and rivers is all contained within, the cost of this background test—including all travel expenses and film—was more than 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Constant spending, endless waste, meticulous research, verisimilitude; the Golden Country constantly wired money to Hawaii. After the film was completed, RKO Pictures' statistics showed that the entire film cost over 2.3 million US dollars, took nine months, and exceeded the budget in every aspect. The biggest reason was waiting for the eruption of the great Kilauea volcano to capture the real scenes of landslides, volcanic eruptions, ground fissures, and tsunamis. Four months were spent waiting and hoping in this state of inactivity.</p>
<p>According to the contract between RKO Pictures and Dolores, she had full authority to manage all expenses during filming in Hawaii. Upon settlement after completion, it was discovered that Dolores had spent more than double the budget. RKO Pictures, dissatisfied with this, canceled Dolores's contract for continued employment.</p>
<p>㈡ The Author's Tragic Encounters</p>
<p>Richard Walton Tully, the author of "The Bird of Paradise," experienced a tragic family breakdown because of this script. Therefore, before narrating Mr. Tully's misfortunes because of "The Bird of Paradise," let me tell some of his life's tragic history.</p>
<p>When Richard was thirteen years old, a flood ruined his father's assets, and he was financially hit. Richard became a theater vendor. He used his wages as a means to study. After graduating from high school, he decided to go to university. During his two years at the University of California, he worked diligently and took the time to write the script for the junior class performance. From many scripts, he actually won the top choice and was staged. Among the audience was Mrs. Fulsom Hans, who learned of the young Richard's hard work and struggle, so she provided financial assistance so that he could graduate from university. While Richard was consulting at the library, he became interested in the native Hawaiians: this was his motivation for writing the script for "The Bird of Paradise."</p>
<p>When "The Bird of Paradise" was staged, it was performed continuously for two years in New York and England. In an instant, Richard had become one of the wealthy men in New York. However, misfortune never left him, and he was suddenly accused of plagiarism. After six years of litigation, he was finally acquitted by the New York Court of Appeals on March 18, 1930.</p>
<p>He won the lawsuit, but he was penniless. At the same time, his wife divorced him. At this time, he only had a script, a full of bitterness, and empty sleeves!</p>
<p>RKO Pictures' purchase of the film adaptation rights to "The Bird of Paradise" was, of course, a turning point for him. This 55-year-old man—Richard—seeing "The Bird of Paradise" exhibited on the screen after the tragedy of death and family breakdown, perhaps a trace of bitter laughter would appear in his tearful face!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e237">A Review of "Svengali" <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>(Synopsis) An old and mysterious musician lives near three painters. The painters often tease the musician, but he is not offended. One day, the musician meets a young woman in the painters' house, whom he recognizes as a talented singer and greatly appreciates. However, the young woman and the youngest of the painters take a liking to each other at first sight, and love blossoms suddenly. The musician spares no effort to hypnotize the young woman and take her away. Years later, the musician and the woman's singing complement each other, and they are famous for a time. The painter tracks them down. One day, the musician, who is performing, dies on stage because he is exhausted and physically weak. However, the young woman's nature cannot be restored, so the painter's arrival ultimately fails to fulfill his long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>This script focuses on the word "demon," so the shots and lighting used are fully imbued with "mystery" and "greatness." In many places, ordinary things are stained with terrifying colors, truly standing out. The director must also have thought, and there is no cliché from beginning to end, only grasping the word "demon" to describe. The background is beautiful. The scenery also deeply shows "antique" and "mystery."</p>
<p>John Barrymore, who plays the musician, is the only protagonist. The makeup and costumes alone are already commendable. The performance is serious and stable, especially the illusory gaze, which is rare. Marian Marsh is a very harmonious assistant. The two different expressions, before and after being bewitched, reflect the musician's painstaking efforts, which is very good. Supporting roles such as Bramwell Fletcher, who plays the young painter, are also very competent. Although the remaining people have few performances, their results are good. Everyone has a "classical" style.</p>
<p>This is one of Warner's best productions ever shown at the Carlton.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e238">㈠ The Issue of Lowering Ticket Prices <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Lun</p>
<p>The downstairs seat prices in the first-class theaters in this city, except for Cathay and Grand, only cost 60 cents, which is already much more accessible to ordinary people than the minimum of one dollar a few years ago. This is thanks to the Nanjing Grand Theater. Before it opened, theaters such as the Odeon, Carlton, and Summer Palace were all showing first-run films, and the lowest seat price during the day was still one dollar. Since Nanjing set the example of charging 60 cents, theaters have followed suit and reduced prices. Later, the opening of Da Guangming and Xin Guang also charged 60 cents. It seems very cheap to see a first-run film for 60 cents, and there is no possibility of further reduction. In fact, that is not true, it can be reduced a little more. Hong Kong is a good example.</p>
<p>The entertainment venues in Hong Kong, such as Queen's and Central, are all magnificent theaters that show first-run films. The Entertainment Theatre even has hot and cold air pipes. Their seat prices are 50 cents for Entertainment and the same for Central, and only 35 cents for Queen's.</p>
<p>According to the above reasons, the ticket prices of Nanjing and others can be lower, because if the ticket prices are reduced, the film rental can also be reduced, and the theaters will not suffer a big loss. But there may be difficulties, because if the ticket prices are reduced, people in the middle class will also go to first-class theaters to see movies, and the business of second-class theaters will be hit. Moreover, the order in the first-class theaters will not be too orderly, right?</p>
<h3 id="e239">㈡ Avoid Defamatory Criticism <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>"It's a Chinese film, not worth watching!" This argument is a common estimate among film-loving audiences when choosing a film. It is an unfounded, defamatory criticism, which invisibly inflicts deep wounds on domestic films! Needless to say, this is the main aspect of the many reasons why domestic films are not promoted.</p>
<p>Art, like social phenomena, is evolving day by day. Look! Domestic films, still in their youth, are booming. We should use our full strength to love, protect, and cultivate them. We should often watch domestic films and give them honest criticism: directors and actors must especially accept the criticism of the audience as much as possible. If they promote each other in this way, domestic films will be able to make great strides in artistic development!</p>
<p>The audience should first understand domestic films before making criticism: if it is just an unfounded estimate, it is easy to injure domestic films! People who love movies should avoid defamatory criticism.</p>
<p>Casual Talk</p>
<h3 id="e240">The Movement of Makeup <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>We know that modern movies can use their unique lenses to capture all kinds of unique characters, but we must know that these all kinds of unique characters cannot be successful without miraculous makeup.</p>
<p>Makeup in Hollywood, the Golden Country, has already been successful, but our Chinese film actors know very little about this, and of course, there is no talk of research. Therefore, we are now specifically raising this issue to awaken the attention of Chinese film actors!</p>
<p>Chinese movie stars, do not think that you already understand that old men should use × oil paint and × powder, and young people and beautiful women should use..., these superficialities are enough to satisfy you. You should also understand how to cover up the blemishes on your face, even out the color of your face, so that it is conducive to photography.</p>
<p>However, our Chinese movie stars have not firmly grasped this weapon of makeup. Let us cite an example, such as the most popular female star today, Ms. Hu Die, no matter what kind of role she plays, we can always recognize her as Hu Die from the same two dimples!</p>
<p>Let's look at a deceased male star in Hollywood, the success of Lon Chaney, and the infinite glory he left in film history, is entirely due to his knowledge of how to use this miraculous weapon of makeup.</p>
<p>Therefore, I advise Chinese film actors to carefully examine the characteristics that the character in the play should have before going on camera and when putting on makeup. At the same time, they should also pay attention to the harmony of the tones between the several people on the stage throughout the play. Then start, cover up and decorate, so that it is neither too much nor too little, and spiritualize it. Then you can get half the certainty of your success on the screen.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that our Chinese movie stars will cleverly use this weapon—makeup.</p>
<p>Film Industry Investigation</p>
<h3 id="e241">About Lianhua's Third Studio <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>｜A Visit to a Film Production Company, Part Nine</p>
<p>The establishment of Lianhua Film Production Company has the ambition to seize the leadership of the Chinese film industry, and it can also be said to be the trustification of the Chinese film industry. Its sphere of influence has expanded from Shanghai, the Hollywood of China, to Beiping and Hong Kong. Therefore, Lianhua established a third production studio in Hong Kong last spring and opened a film talent training institute: Mr. Li Beihai, a senior in the film industry, presided over the matter, and then searched for film professionals from Guangdong and Hong Kong, such as Liang Shaopo and Guan Wenqing, to help with the work. After a considerable period of preparation, it began its film production work.</p>
<p>The maiden work of Lianhua's Third Studio was "Iron Bone Orchid Heart," written by the famous playwright Liang Shaopo, co-starring Shi Youyu and Feng Jiezhen, and directed by Guan Wenqing. This play has been shown in Shanghai for a long time, and it has a strong local color and is full of Cantonese flavor.</p>
<p>The second production was "Cuckoo's Cry in the Ancient Temple," a script written by Luo Mingyou himself, directed by Liang Shaopo, and starring Xue Zhaorong and Tang Xingtut. It was filmed at the end of last year. It is also a play about Cantonese people.</p>
<p>As for the third production, although the script "Wise Mother" written by Li Beihai has been selected, it has not been realized. It has not been put into the camera work. In this world economic panic and commercial depression, Lianhua's Third Studio has stopped invisibly.</p>
<p>However, whether it can continue to produce films in the future, it is not dare to say for sure now.</p>
<p>Film Studio Gossip</p>
<h3 id="e242">Lin Chuchu and Xuan Jinglin <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Shen</p>
<p>There are two female stars in the Chinese film industry. Neither of them has beautiful faces, but they both have sad personalities: one is Li Minwei's wife, Lin Chuchu, and the other is Xuan Jinglin, known as the Little Old Woman.</p>
<p>Xuan Jinglin's history on the screen may be longer than Lin Chuchu's, but her gains are far less than Lin Chuchu's!</p>
<p>Which bright female star does not envy vanity, and is willing to give up her youthful beauty to play a little old woman? But Lin Chuchu does not care about this. She would rather wear a bun and old clothes on the screen. She wears foot-binding pants. Her clothes are at least half a century away from the era. The audience still remembers the virtuous country woman who said goodbye to her husband, sold her son, and died her parents-in-law! I can say that none of those who have seen the human path have not been imprinted in their hearts for a long time. There is also the abandoned woman in "Dreams of the Old Capital," and the long-suffering mother in "Continuation of Dreams of the Old Capital." Although they are the most sorrowful materials in the world, I can also say that without her sad expression, they cannot be expressed.</p>
<p>Xuan Jinglin's personality and status seem to be no different from Lin Chuchu's, but the roles she plays are different. The year before, she was still playing female students and singers in Tianyi Company. Undoubtedly, this violated her innate face and personality. Therefore, her achievements were not perfect.</p>
<p>Now she is away from the life of the screen, and it is said that she is coming again. We sincerely hope that she can recognize herself and not repeat the same mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Marean Nixon Robbed <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen Hua</p>
<p>Two months ago, Marean Nixon and her husband, Edward Hillman, were happily living in their Beverly Hills home. Unexpectedly, they suddenly received a threatening letter asking them to borrow a large sum of money, but they turned a deaf ear to it. Soon after, they announced that they would travel to Europe. Unfortunately, they were robbed in a car while traveling in Europe. Afterwards, they lost a total of four hundred yuan in cash and many valuable jewelry. In addition, Marean suffered a pointless scare. Fortunately, the bandits were captured a few days later, but they were very afraid of the bandits' revenge in the future. Therefore, they hired several strong and capable bodyguards who followed her all day long.</p>

<h3 id="e244">"Dare You!?" <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>The previous nine expression solo practice methods used a deep breathing progressive retreat method of practice because they wanted scholars to develop a habit of being able to self-consciously move their own expressions.</p>
<p>Now we want to go a step further and use the power of sound to help our expressions. Originally, expressions are divided into two types. The first type is gestural expression, which moves people through sight. The second type is sound expression, which moves people through hearing. What we have practiced is only the most important part of gestural expression. Currently, because of space limitations, we have to show part of the power of sound expression.</p>
<p>This is the tenth style of expression solo practice. It is roughly similar to the second style discussed in detail above. However, this is to use sound to increase the power of expression without deep breathing.</p>
<p>Scholars still follow the previous method to focus on the center of their eyebrows in the mirror, and then deeply inhale a breath from their nostrils. When inhaling, the eyes gradually become angry.</p>
<p>You first carefully observe the extent of your angry expression. Then shout "Dare you!?" at the shadow in the mirror. At the same time, your fists and arms also do their best to help. Then see how much the expression has increased.</p>
