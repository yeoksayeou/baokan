<p>時評</p>
<h3>上海之恐佈</h3>
<p>在極端隱忍與極端退讓之下。日軍終不免於實力發動。陷全上海數百萬生命於極端恐慌危險之悲境中。吾人從可知隱忍終無以遏止有計劃之襲擊而退讓亦終有窮盡之時。環顧國内。狼烟四起。敵入益深。禍患益亟。誰實爲之。誤國至此。吾人眞有血可嘔。無淚可揮。</p>
<p>自九一八東省事件發生以來日人即步步進逼由天津而靑島。而福州。今又進而至上海。蓋爲一整個有計劃有步驟之行動其目的在於必造成太平洋上之慘劇掀起全世界恐怖之黑潮。故上海目前之禍變絶非局部問題亦非單純的中國問題。而實爲關係太平洋以至整個世界之嚴重問題。</p>
<p>退一步言。上海爲中西人士薈集之區。今數百萬無辜之之生命。一旦置之於生死綫上鎗彈之荼毒。炮火之燬滅極人世間之慘事。自昨日至今日吾人目擊無辜之難民。相與扶老携幼。倉皇避死。閘北一帶。砲聲震地。火光燭天。己成地獄。非復人境基於人道與公理之立塲而言。全世界人士此時。亦亟應起而作有效之發言。</p>
<p>日人今日所加諸我國者。無理己達至極姑無論我國近數月來民情之昻奮。抗日運動之風起。槪由於日人之侵略壓迫所激成。日人欲緩和我國之民情。必先自改善其對華政策。世固無一國之政府。能命令其國民必購買某國貨物之理。且自日前日領提出四項要求而後。我國爲顧全全滬數百萬無辜之生命。并避免增重嚴重之情勢計。己含悲忍痛完全接受。即日領亦己表示滿意。然而滿意之後。鎗聲忽起。戰幕揭開。慘劇遂成。揆諸公理。質之正義日人之肆其强力。恣意横行。毫無顧忌應爲全世界人士所共見</p>
<p>吾人逆料日人將來必宣告於世界曰。［上海之變。蓋由於軍人之憤激所激成。非外交官所能爲力。此誠爲一不幸事］。此種推諉敷衍矇蔽世人耳目之政策。己一行之於瀋陽。再行之於天津所謂兩重外交實即日人最狡猾最陰毒之外交。全世界明眼人士。當亦可燭洞其隱微。</p>
<p>禍變今旣己造成。我國隱忍退讓今亦己至末路之末無復控制其發展擴大之能力。而且自九一八以來。我國所蒙受之凌辱斷非有血氣之民族所甘忍受隱忍之極。退讓己窮。而日人仍步步逼緊。雖欲避死而不可得事至今日。所惡巳有甚於亡國者。奮我全民族之力。以必死之决心。自衛自救。爭取我民族之生存。并以維護一綫僅存之公理與正義。此爲我民族之天職决毅然肩承不敢逃避。</p>
<p>不過吾人敢再四鄭重爲全世界人士告。中國問題即太平洋問題。亦即世界問題。星星之火。可以燎原。但看目前太平洋上劍拔弩張之嚴重情勢。即可知禍機茲巳發動。全人類之災禍。或其即在目前世界各國人士爲維持世界和平之局面計。爲避免全人類之災禍計。裁抑强權。消弭禍機。千鈞一髮此即其時。</p>

<p>首次日機之轟炸將近天明、約在上午五時、天方大雨、而軋軋之聲凌空而至、初來一機、繼來三架、日方用電光以照飛機、當日機到時、我方軍隊即全行停止放槍、在黑暗中日機不能得到目標、故三飛機在閘北空中盤旋、經一小時之久、直至黎明、始放一炸彈、轟然一聲、左右房屋均震動、旋聞湖州會館己被炸毁、復再飛至鴻興坊三德里口、擬炸毁國民黨之區分部者、以投彈不准、將香山路民房炸去兩幢、記者所居之屋、被震將倒、天己漸明、記者乃冒險挈妻女由火綫中逃出華興里、時永興路左右各段、均早堆置砂袋、巳不能行走矣、</p>
<p>我軍應戰甚得力今次我方純出於十九路軍自衛之戰、昨晨日機來滬北轟炸時、初時無高射砲、僅用迫擊砲及步槍射擊之、至上午九時許、我方調到　軍、、携來高射砲數尊、記者因欲越過火綫、而至北四川路、在香山路方面、隨同十九路軍同行到　江路時、因日方用機槍掃射、由十九路軍勸記者折回向西、而求出路、沿途逃難之人民、由十九路軍隨處保護、並勸告遇見日機飛過、切勿密集、對於阻斷交通處、且代疏通行道、其愛護人民之誠摯、與行軍紀律之整肅、在我國軍隊中實首屈一指也、二次日機到來、因我方有高射砲、擊毁其一機、而餘兩機、竟改爲高度飛行、不敢放炸彈矣、</p>
<p>日飛機慘無人道在十時以後、日飛機畏我高射砲、乃改換方向、向閘北西方面之商民市塲、亂擲炸彈、北南林里見我方大批逃難人衆、日機竟抛擲一彈、炸死難民多人、逃難之人因四處鐵門封鎖、多從蘇州河乘船至英租界、最可感念者爲上海自來火行之西人及工人等助救難民、約數萬人上岸、日飛機在法租界金利源日字八號碼頭、投下一彈、炸傷該局稽查一人、興小工兩名、又在新開河泰豐船票局前投擲一彈、傷人力車夫工人及路人各一名、午後更用引火彈、到處亂投、引起商務書館等大火、</p>

<p>新擬宣言失其價値</p>
<p>顏惠慶提出盟約第十·十一條</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國總代表顏惠慶博士今日正式援引國聯會章第十條與第十一條、並保留援引所覺必要之某他各條、按第十條規定會員担任尊重與維護各會員國之土地完整、與現有之政治獨立、以拒外來之侵略、如有此種侵略、或有此種侵略之任何恫嚇與危險、行政會應議定方法、以履行此種義務、第十一條規定會員保留取維持權利與公道行動權利、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國總代表顏惠慶博士今日致文國聯秘書長、文曰、茲奉本國政府訓令、護以下列數端奉請注意、（一）國聯兩員會中日兩國間發生爭端事、因日本違背國聯會章、侵犯中國之土地與行政完整及政治獨立而起、（二）此種爭端尚未依照國聯會章之條欵提請公斷或法律解决、（三）此爭端現巳臻似可引起中日兩國立即决裂之地步、（四）中國因此請援用（非减損國聯所己取或將取以實施第十一條下其職務之計畫、乃增加之耳、）國聯會章第十條與第十一條以處置此項爭端、並正式以此事提交行政會、懇依此二條取適當必要之行動、（二十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國之行動、使國聯處於窘迫之地位、今晨原定舉行行政會公開會議、茲巳展至午後三時三十分、陽稱因議程未經預備之故、今日午後大約必討論中國將援引國聯會章第十五條與第十六條一節、按第十五條之規定國聯必須立即進行獨立調查、調查後必實行之、第十六條規定各項裁制、但須兩國宣戰後始能適用、今尚未至此地步、行政會主席彭古今晨與其他五大會員密商、行政會在今日午後公開會議前、先作半小時之會商、不請中日委員代表列席、（二十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯會行政院主席彭古得知上海哈爾濱兩處發生軍事行動、曁中國代表顏惠慶提出要求之後、即召集英意德曁與中日爭端較有直接關係各國代表相商榷、并與國聯會秘書長德魯蒙副秘書長愛文諾晤談、行政院將於午後開會、彭古當將事變情形提出報告、并請行政院就巳經擬定各項辦法之中、對於某某項表示贊否、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）中國國聯總代表顏惠慶今日對於日軍佔領上海中國境土之舉、有極强硬之表示、顏氏今日對新聞記者發表宣言、斷然拒絶國聯理事會會長彭古所擬於下次理事會會議席上宣布關於中日緊急問題之布告、顏氏之言曰、吾人四個月以來、向國聯陳訴己舌焦唇敝、現上海之報告巳經傳來、可見唇舌己不足補救、非積極舉動、不足以阻止暴日之行動、故理事會會長彭古己决定明日會議不宣讀布告、因環境巳使宣言失其價値也、但如下事會不欲宣讀布告文者、則余惟有依照余原有之計劃進行、所謂原有之計劃者、即提出國聯會章第十條或意提出第十五條第十六條云、據確實報告、於顏氏未發表宣言之前、理事會曾擬就一種布告、内包含下列之五點、（一）承認門户公開政策、（二）尊重現行中日間之條約、（三）尊重理事會調查團之職務、（四）重加追認對於九國條約之重視、（五）重加追認國聯理事會去年九月三十日及十二月十日之决議案、顏惠慶謂日軍在遼省天津上海之行徑、己與中國貿易上一大打擊、今苟欲救濟世界之經濟危機、非先求中日爭端之解决不可也、（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯行政會今日五時半集議、中日代表未出席、會商一小時巳議定議長彭古所須宣讀之宣言、原文尚未公佈、惟路透社探悉宣言範圍、較一般人前所信者爲廣、聞宣言簡直如新近美牒之回聲、宣言中歡迎美牒對於國聯現所採行者之言論、如言及關於調查團所可有之結果者是、並聲明華盛頓公約亦關係他國、除中日兩國外、他國亦在門户開放之政策中、有同樣之關係、凡與國聯會章牴觸之任何解决法、非國聯所可允許、宣言文繼特聲明會章第十條、依此條文、在會各國擔　尊重並保　土地完整、以抗外來侵略、宣言文末稱、解决愈拖延時日、則　　　　决目的、將會　難云、行政會以爲在未接調查團第一次報告時、通過任何議案、殊無目標、此項宣言文、今夜將以副本分送中日代表、衆望此文可望使中代表顏惠慶博士滿意、顏得上海最近消息後、現極爲焦均、行政會一致再勸秘書長德魯蒙收回辭職書、德氏不允、國聯遂喪失國聯成立以來即指導其命運之一人矣、德魯蒙供職約十三年、衆料其將於明年初解戰、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦國聯愶會今日通過决議案、要救政府取嚴厲行動恢復遠東之和平、並證實國聯會章之權威、該决議案聲明協會願以其權力所能之各種方法、贊助政府此種行動、如國聯行政會所用之方法不足應付目下嚴重與日烈之危險、則政府應提議立即召集國聯議會云、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>滬局突轉嚴重美政府大震驚</h3>
<p>對東京聲明表懷疑</p>
<p>不日將有宣言發出</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府聞上海中日兵决裂之說、大爲驚詫、今日極注意上海方面之消息、此間官員現信滬局巳漸臻將大碍美國利益與政策之地步、聞美國决計充分保護其上海貿易之權利、今日東京發表聲明書、解釋日兵攻擊上海華界之理由、謂此舉乃屬保護日僑生命財産業所必要云云、此間當局對於此文、甚不謂然、謂此種解釋、正如日兵在滿實行勦匪之前所發者、其結果卒將錦州佔據云、國務院現因上海局勢日見嚴重、此間人心大爲憂慮、故日内對於滬局將有確切宣言、美政府曾開會多次、考慮應取之行動、（二十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）駐美英大使林德賽在國務卿史汀生家中與史氏作歷時頗久之會議、雖關於此次討論之公報並未發展、然有顯然可見者、美官塲極欲英國說明其地位、據非正式消息、日政府如以佔據上海爲保護日人生命財産所必要之舉動、則美國不欲對日兵之佔據加以抗議、但若日軍侵入公共租界、則美國不能默視之、因美政府確信租界外兵對於界内日僑、能予以各種必要之保護也、華盛頓接日本擬封鎖上海之消息、大爲駭異、但官塲不信此說、謂封鎖等於破壞國際公法之戰爭計畫云、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美政府今日仍密切注視上海之時局、聞國務院力主日本軍隊不得開入公共租界、惟日軍如爲保護其僑民計開入華界、美政府並不反對英國對美國務卿史汀生向駐華盛頓英國大使非正式提議請英國與美國協同對日實行經濟抵制一節、英國對此尚無正式布告、現確信英國不致贊成、美國因此亦不致單獨進行、據報載倫敦消息、英國對美國之建議、不取同情之態度、（二十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院與英大使署今日均否認英大使會訪國務卿史汀生討論對日施經濟壓力之說、國務院對於滬局現不欲發任何評論、（二十八日國民社電）</p>
<h3>國民黨駐歐代表摘國聯無能</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）中國國民黨駐歐代表朱君（譯音）發表一宣言、批評國聯會之態度、謂國聯會柔弱無能、且似乎對於此次中日糾紛持不管態度、而日本之軍事行動、正不止在滿洲北部進行、且擴張而達於中國中部、國聯會在糾紛開始時、己認識此事、何以任其如此擴大、國聯會在處理此事件之態度、實與其解决危險世界和平之糾紛、與維持國際契約尊重之目的相背、中國一面須應付其國内政治及社會之困難、一面仍忠於其所負之國際義務、今特呼籲全世界及國聯會之良心援助云、最後該宣言復謂國聯會以其所持之態度、實不啻容許日本破壞國際之契約如九國公約凱洛公約及國聯會之盟約之類、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>駐滬日武官電陸軍省乞援</h3>
<p>（東京）上海日本陸軍武官電致陸軍省、請派陸軍至滬、惟海軍當局似以爲海軍能應付現局、無需陸軍之助、聞駐滬日總領事亦向政府表示恐慌、以現有陸戰隊不足抵敵華軍爲慮、政府正草擬聲明書、定明日發表、解釋日兵在滬所取行動之必要、並保證日本無其外目的、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>英報批評滬事</h3>
<p>日軍閥驕横黷武</p>
<p>行見其必將自斃</p>
<p>倫敦今晨各報皆在顯要地位詳載上海消息、而視其他消息爲次要新聞、上海消息及美國對於日人舉動之消息、皆佔數欄地位、此外尚有特撰論文與社評、公共注意現完全集中於上海、每日驛報稱、日本帝國主義巳顯明的决心欲征服中國、要知上海非即中國内地、尚有力量可出與日本周旋、不過稍緩耳、日本加於中國之新侵略、其結果或不爲勝利、但爲日本黷武主義之自殺云、彙聞報今晨社論批評日人佔據上海事、謂諺有之曰、眞宰所欲毁者、其人輒先發狂、日本軍閥今所爲者、殆此之謂歟、日本軍閥不獨驕横、且亦盲行、除黷武外、不顧其他、乃日政府機關竟爲其支配也、日本海陸司令或行其心目中所視爲正當之舉動、但欲掩飾將來結果之異嚴重、殊無所得也云、每日電聞批評新近之發展、謂前承認日本對滿態度之正當者、今鑒於日本竟在各國咸有極大利害關係的上海之極易爆裂事態中、逞其兵力、欲不疑懼、不可得也、日本自謂其所爲者、亦任何國所許爲者、此說固不可驟然抹殺、但日本果能控制危險事態、而使之不碍及他國所有與日本同一悠久之權利乎、此其關鍵也云、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦孟却斯德指導報今日載有社論、謂中國旣巳承認日本哀的美敦書之要求、而日兵復接以確實佔據中國土地、中國人民之公憤、使提倡抗日抵制者數次扣留與毁壞日貨、然無論如何、此種可指摘之行動、不足爲異、抵制之蔓延、如可爲日兵佔據上海華界之合法藉口、則日兵侵略中國之大部分、亦可同一有理矣、泰西各國在中國沿海之利益、視日本在滿洲之利益爲大、今己處於危險中、如彼等之商務與投資受重大之危害、則在原則問題上彼等所不願取之行動、今巳有迅速取之之可能、指導報之意、將來之發展、全視日本想像能依賴泰西各國所巳表示之非常忍耐可再倚賴幾久爲定、美國顯將歡迎英國合作施行更有力之政策、雖今日尚未成事實、但日人如再前進、則必實現、指導報末謂英國在爭端之初步如準備與美國合作、則今日上海之事變不致發生云（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦泰晤士報今晨社論、謂日本行爲能否有使南京政府醒悟之効力、如日本似所期望者、殊難决言、但恐適增長江流域之紊亂、或促成排外風潮之復活耳、一九二七年英日美意法曾以海陸兵保護租界、今與租界有關係之十四國、因日本艦隊司令之斷然行動、而將愈增其責任云、著名新聞記者史本德在彙聞報發表一文、謂爲安全計、國聯或列强應與中日兩國辦理全部問題、必須爲滿洲製一種憲法、以保障目前秩序、並防止將來在中國紊亂時期中滿洲落於外人之手云、（二十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Horror</h3>
<p>Under extreme forbearance and extreme concession, the Japanese army has inevitably resorted to force, plunging the millions of lives in Shanghai into a state of extreme panic and danger. From this, we can see that forbearance cannot ultimately prevent planned attacks, and concessions will eventually have their limits. Looking around the country, smoke billows everywhere, the enemy penetrates deeper, and the disasters become more urgent. Who is truly responsible for this? Misleading the country to this extent? We truly have blood to vomit, but no tears to shed.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in the Eastern Provinces, the Japanese have been advancing step by step, from Tianjin to Qingdao, and then to Fuzhou. Now they have advanced to Shanghai. This is all part of a planned and methodical operation, with the goal of creating a tragedy in the Pacific and unleashing a black tide of terror upon the world. Therefore, the current disaster in Shanghai is by no means a local issue, nor is it a purely Chinese problem. It is, in fact, a serious issue that concerns the Pacific and the entire world.</p>
<p>To put it another way, Shanghai is a place where Chinese and Western people gather. Now, millions of innocent lives are placed on the line between life and death, poisoned by bullets and devastated by artillery fire, the most tragic event in the human world. From yesterday to today, we have witnessed innocent refugees, helping the old and carrying the young, fleeing in panic to escape death. The Zhabei area is filled with the sound of artillery fire, and the flames light up the sky, turning it into hell, no longer a human realm. Based on the standpoint of humanitarianism and justice, people all over the world should rise up at this time and make effective voices.</p>
<p>The unreasonableness that the Japanese are imposing on our country today has reached its limit. Regardless of the fact that the surge in public sentiment and the rise of the anti-Japanese movement in our country in recent months have been provoked by Japanese aggression and oppression, if the Japanese want to ease the public sentiment in our country, they must first improve their policy towards China. There is no government in the world that can order its citizens to buy goods from a certain country. Moreover, since the Japanese consul presented four demands the other day, our country, in order to protect the lives of millions of innocent people in Shanghai and avoid aggravating the serious situation, has accepted them completely with sorrow and pain. Even the Japanese consul has expressed satisfaction. However, after satisfaction, gunfire suddenly erupted, the curtain of war was unveiled, and the tragedy was completed. Judging by reason and justice, the Japanese are using their power arbitrarily and recklessly, without any scruples, which should be seen by people all over the world.</p>
<p>We anticipate that the Japanese will declare to the world in the future: [The change in Shanghai was caused by the anger of the soldiers and could not be helped by diplomats. This is indeed an unfortunate event.] This kind of policy of shirking responsibility, perfunctorily deceiving the eyes and ears of the world, has already been implemented in Shenyang and then in Tianjin. The so-called double diplomacy is actually the most cunning and most poisonous diplomacy of the Japanese. Clear-eyed people all over the world should also be able to discern its hidden subtleties.</p>
<p>The disaster has now been created. Our country's forbearance and concession have now reached the end of the road, and we no longer have the ability to control its development and expansion. Moreover, since September 18th, the humiliation suffered by our country is by no means something that any nation with blood and courage can willingly endure. Forbearance has reached its limit, and concession has reached its end, but the Japanese are still pressing tighter step by step. Even if we want to avoid death, we cannot. The matter has reached the point where what is hated is even worse than the demise of the country. Let us use the strength of our entire nation, with the determination to die, to defend ourselves, save ourselves, strive for the survival of our nation, and maintain the only remaining line of justice and righteousness. This is the natural duty of our nation, and we are determined to shoulder it and dare not escape.</p>
<p>However, we dare to solemnly tell the people of the world again and again that the China problem is the Pacific problem, which is also the world problem. A spark can start a prairie fire. Just look at the serious situation of swords drawn and bows bent in the Pacific today, and you can know that the root of disaster has already been launched. The catastrophe of all mankind may be right in front of us. For the sake of maintaining world peace and avoiding the catastrophe of all mankind, countries all over the world must curb power and eliminate the root of disaster. This is the time of crisis.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Our Army Recaptures Tiantong'an Station and Other Places</h3>
<p>Wusong is also Firmly Defended by Our Army</p>
<p>Japanese Consul Requests Ceasefire Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Taxpayers' Association Lodges Protest Yesterday</p>
<p>Business and Industrial Circles Express Resistance Against Aggression</p>
<p>Cultural Institutions Tragically Burned Down</p>
<p>Fighting Finally Takes Place on Bazi Road</p>
<p>After the Japanese soldiers, at 11:50 pm the night before last, groundlessly occupied Tiantong'an Station on Songhu Road and challenged the 78th Division of our garrison Cai Tingkai's forces, the two sides officially came into contact at 12:00 am that night. Details were reported yesterday. The battle lines between the two sides have changed yesterday. The Japanese soldiers who originally advanced from Tiantong'an Station and Songhu Road to try to enter Tiantong'an Road and Jiangwan Road were defeated by our army and withdrew at about 1:00 pm yesterday. At the same time, there was news that the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps near Huanglu Road had also been occupied by our army. The temporary headquarters set up in the Japanese elementary school on North Sichuan Road, fearing encirclement when it learned that our army had gained the upper hand on Zhaosheng Road and was advancing along Qiujiang Road, hastily abandoned it and retreated to the Sichuan Road Bridge, temporarily occupying the General Post Office as a garrison. However, our army, believing that the road built beyond the border should not be used by the Japanese army, pursued them to Dade Lane on North Sichuan Road and temporarily stopped. Then, they advanced to the intersection of Laobazi Road and Zhimeng, joining forces with our army on Qiujiang Road. Until 5:00 pm, the Japanese soldiers stationed in the post office on North Sichuan Road were nowhere to be seen. At the same time, the Japanese troops stationed near the Xiaocai Market on Haining Road and North Henan Road also retreated to the north embankment of Tianfei Palace Bridge. The No. 10 public bus only travels between Sanmaoge Bridge and the south embankment of Tianfei Palace Bridge. Up to 6:00 yesterday</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>As of the hour, the front lines of our army, on North Sichuan Road, North Henan Road, Qiujiang Road, and Baoshan Road, have been able to echo each other. All the places attacked and occupied by the Japanese soldiers the night before last were recaptured by our army. In total, four armored vehicles were captured in this battle, one was destroyed, four airplanes were shot down, and about 1,000 enemy soldiers were killed or wounded. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Recapture of Tiantong'an Station Zhao Yu'er, a second-class policeman of the Sixth Squadron of the Public Security Bureau, was wounded in a fierce battle with Japanese soldiers near Tiantong'an Station yesterday morning. According to his conversation with a reporter from Xin Sheng She, the circumstances of the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies and the occupation and recapture of Tiantong'an Station are as follows: The Public Security Bureau sent six policemen from the Sixth Squadron to defend the defensive works such as sandbags set up at the intersection of Tiantong'an Road and Tongji Road the night before last. At 11:40 pm, they suddenly discovered several Japanese armored vehicles carrying more than 30 Japanese Marines. When the guards asked for the password, the Japanese soldiers immediately opened fire with machine guns. The six policemen immediately resisted and fought back with rifles. However, because they were outnumbered, they retreated towards Yokohama Road and reported to Sun Mou, the captain of the Sixth Squadron of the Public Security Bureau stationed there. Captain Sun, upon hearing the news, immediately led more than 60 policemen to reinforce them. However, the Japanese armored vehicles swept the area with machine guns very fiercely. After more than ten minutes, they also retreated. At this time, Tiantong'an Station had been occupied by the Japanese army. They gathered on Qingyun Road and received reinforcements from the machine gun team of the Sixth Regiment of the Military Police. Their morale was greatly boosted. They immediately launched a vigorous counterattack. After two hours of fighting, the 5th Regiment of the 19th Route Army also arrived upon hearing the news and joined the battle. The Japanese soldiers were surrounded by our army. At about 3:00 am, the Japanese soldiers who attacked Tiantong'an Railway Station were completely annihilated, and three armored vehicles were captured. One of them was damaged, and the other two could still be used. At 3:30, another team of Japanese soldiers attacked Tiantong'an Station. Our army fought back again, and the Japanese failed and retreated. As a result, Tiantong'an Station was recaptured by our army. In this battle, our army suffered more than ten casualties, while the Japanese army suffered nearly a hundred casualties. Situation of Street Fighting in Sichuan Road The most intense street fighting in the North Sichuan Road area took place on Chuangong Road and Yinggui Road opposite Arui Lane. The Japanese army launched three routes of attack on Zhabei this time. One route entered Tiantong'an Road from Jiangwan Road and besieged the North Railway Station. However, it had been repulsed by our army on Tiantong'an Road, and the</p>
<h3>General Cai Tingkai, Who Bravely Resisted Japan (Photo by This Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Japanese naval headquarters near Hongkou Park on Jiangwan Road were destroyed. One route, the 3rd Team of the Marine Corps stationed in the Japanese elementary school on Yinggui Road, advanced westward along the road, attempting to connect with the Japanese armored vehicle team on Yokohama Road and Tiantong'an. Another route attacked the North Station directly from Qiujiang Road. Therefore, street fighting was very fierce near North Sichuan Road, such as Chuangong Road and Yinggui Road. Yinggui Road was besieged by our army yesterday morning. By 11:30 am yesterday, all the Japanese soldiers based in the Japanese elementary school on the road had withdrawn. Both sides suffered many casualties. The Japanese army attacking from Qiujiang Road was repulsed by our army. On Chuangong Road and Guangdong Street, street fighting was extremely fierce. The bodies of Japanese soldiers lying across the street were everywhere. During the street fighting there, Wang Tianxiong, a platoon leader of our army's military police, led a team of military police to charge, intending to cross North Sichuan Road. Therefore, at around 12:00 noon, gunfire was heard very clearly at the intersection of Laobazi Road and North Sichuan Road. At the same time, the Japanese machine guns at the entrance of the concession also fired heavily. The gunfire gradually subsided at about 1:00 pm. It was heard that Platoon Leader Wang and the team of military police he led had not returned, and something unexpected might have happened. At that time, the Japanese were using trucks to transport sacks and sand to build defensive works. This also shows the defeat of the Japanese army at that time.</p>
<p>The Situation of the Battle on Fusheng Road Yesterday Afternoon Fusheng Road, the horizontal road between Bazi Road, is the intersection of the Chinese and Concession areas. At 3:00 or 4:00 am yesterday morning, dozens of Japanese soldiers rushed in from Bazi Road and had a minor conflict with our army. By 5:00 or 6:00 am, the situation turned into a fierce battle. Our army, the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Regiment of the Military Police, fought bravely. However, because the number of Japanese soldiers increased, they retreated slightly to the intersection of Xinmin Road and Baoshan Road north of Fusheng Road. The Japanese army forcibly climbed onto the small buildings of the local people, tightly closed the windows, and shot from the shadows, hiding in the rooms after shooting, making it impossible for our army to catch them. Battalion Commander Shen urged his subordinates to pile up sandbags on the boundary road (opposite the small buildings occupied by the Japanese army) and deal with them. Since then, there has been mutual gunfire, and the casualties on both sides are not significant yet.</p>
<p>Four Japanese Planes Shot Down Yesterday, Japanese planes dropped bombs everywhere, causing great damage. At about 4:00 am, about five planes circled and flew in the sky over Zhabei and Nanshi. The sound of grinding was heard. At that time, the morning mist had not cleared, and the drizzle was hazy. A total of four Japanese planes were shot down. One was shot down by anti-aircraft guns at 2:00 pm yesterday and fell at the Baoshan Road Wusong Road Station. Another two were shot down by air combat fighters flying out of Hongqiao. Because the Japanese planes flew in from Wusong, the sky was not clear. Soon, our planes followed. They suspected that they were concession planes and did not care at all. They were still dropping bombs in the vicinity of the Commercial Press. When our planes saw them doing damage, they went forward and flew high above the Japanese planes and fired with machine guns, falling in front of the Sun Temple Shanghai-Taizhou Long-Distance Bus Company.</p>
<p>News at 2:00 AM Today Yesterday, the Japanese consul requested our authorities to cease fire, and British and American consuls mediated between the two sides. The two sides agreed to stop the attack by 8:00 pm that night. However, until 10:00 pm, the other side's guns and bullets were still firing at the Chinese area. Our authorities questioned the Japanese consul, who replied that they were plainclothes teams. By 1:00 am this morning, the gunfire was still dense, but the location had shifted between North Sichuan Road, Laobazi Road, and Dolean Road. As of 2:30 am this morning, within our army's defense line, from Baoshan Road, along the Songhu Railway to the Jiangwan Road area, there were no traces of Japanese troops. South of the railway in the Sichuan Road area, there were still remnants of the Japanese army, and fierce fighting was going on. Several Japanese soldiers were still guarding the north embankment of the Sichuan Road Bridge, absolutely prohibiting passage. In addition, many Japanese plainclothes teams were scattered in the Hongkou area, wearing a strip of white cloth and a strip of red cloth on their left hands.</p>
<p>Latest News This Morning At 2:15 AM, our reporter braved the danger to inspect the Sichuan Road Bridge, the Tianfei Palace Bridge, and the area along the Suzhou Creek. When the reporter arrived at the south embankment of the Sichuan Road Bridge, the gunfire seemed to be in the North Sichuan Road section. Although the gunfire was not very dense, the sound of bullets flying in the air was very clear, and the direction seemed to be gradually moving from northwest to southeast. The reporter then drove to the south bank of the Lao Zha Bridge and walked along the Suzhou Creek to the south embankment of the Tianfei Palace Bridge. The gunfire was very close. From 3:05 AM to 3:30 AM, the gunfire was very intense. It seemed that rifles, machine guns, submachine guns, and hand grenades were being fired constantly during a fierce battle, shaking the eardrums. According to people who had escaped from the north of the Suzhou Creek, the Japanese troops were all in the Haining Road and North Sichuan Road areas. When the reporter returned to the newspaper office to write the manuscript at 4:00 AM, he still heard very dense gunfire.</p>
<h3>North Railway Station Bombed by Japanese Planes</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai North Railway Station, the essential route between the capitals of Shanghai and Hangzhou, as well as the North Station Depot and North Station Engine room, were also bombed with sulfur bombs by Japanese planes yesterday, completely destroyed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese planes dropped bombs, first targeting the North Railway Station, at around 8:00 AM. The first two bombs landed outside the office of the Traffic Department and did not explode. The station yard also received three bombs, but there was no major damage. The McGann Road and Zhenru areas also received bombs, but because our army's bombing was very intense, they did not succeed. At around 9:00 AM, a bomb landed on the roof of the North Station Engine Room, which was destroyed and collapsed. However, because the building was entirely built of iron and tile, there was no disaster. At around 1:00 PM, the North Station Depot also received a bomb, and after the explosion, it immediately spread to the depot. The goods in the depot had not been transported out due to the impact of the war, and now they are all burned to ashes. The loss is estimated to be over a million yuan. At 2:30 PM, the four-story roof of the North Station Administration Bureau was also bombed, and the fire spread downwards, gradually reaching the office of the Traffic Department on the lower floor. Two trains of armored vehicles parked in the station yard were also bombed. With a loud crash, the military supplies inside the cars exploded as a result, causing the station building to collapse from the shock. The fire started at 2:30 PM and had not been extinguished by 10:00 PM. It is thought to have turned into scorched earth.</p>

<h3>Volunteers Join the Battle</h3>
<p>After the Japanese army launched an attack on Zhabei the night before last (28th), the General Headquarters of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army of Retired Soldiers of the Republic of China heard the news and immediately sent more than 200 volunteers to the vicinity of Tiantong'an at the end of North Sichuan Road to participate in resisting the Japanese army. Because the army was newly established and lacked weapons, the participants in the battle were divided into groups of 20, with a total of ten groups. There were only more than 60 guns, some with box cannons, and most were still empty-handed. They bravely rushed towards the headquarters of the Japanese army to attack, capturing more than 40 Japanese guns. More than 20 Japanese soldiers were injured, but the volunteers suffered four casualties. After participating in this battle, the General Headquarters of the Volunteers yesterday summoned more than a thousand volunteers, with extremely high morale. It was also heard that after the various volunteer forces rose up, the forces of Wang Yaqiao, Wang Dawen, Chen Yinong, and Yu Zhikui have reached tens of thousands, and they have established contact with the 19th Route Army. Attempt to Bomb the Troop Train Failed Yesterday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, when a military train of our army at the North Station left the platform and drove north, two Japanese planes happened to be circling in the eastern sky. They discovered the military train heading north and immediately tracked it to the North Station. When the military train drove to McGann Road, the Japanese planes had already flown to the sky above and immediately dropped several bombs, but they did not hit. The bombs dropped all landed in the vicinity of McGann Road and in the civilian houses along Xinmin Road. As a result, the civilian houses there immediately caught fire and burned until about 5:00 PM before being extinguished. Zhenru Bombed with Three Bombs Yesterday afternoon at 2:50 PM, two Japanese military planes flew from the Pudong area to the sky above Zhenru and dropped three bombs. Our army there used anti-aircraft guns to shoot at them. The planes flew to the eastern side and returned after a while, but did not drop bombs. Dismantling Steel Rails on the Fanwangdu Road Yesterday morning at around 11:00 AM, about a dozen soldiers of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in the Toyota Spinning Mill, dressed in plain clothes, went to the Fanwangdu Station and pried off two steel rails on the railway bridge near the station with iron bars. They stayed there for about an hour before leaving. At the same time, traffic around the area was cut off. The Railway Bureau is now sending workers to repair it. Japanese Military Officers Discovered on Rooftops Yesterday morning, while Japanese military planes were dropping bombs in the Chinese area, someone saw a Japanese military officer on the roof of the Summer Place opposite the Xieqiao General Association on Jing'an Temple Road, holding two small flags and a telescope, waving the flags and looking into the sky. A similar situation was also seen on the roof of a factory at the Suzhou Creek entrance on Xin Zha Road.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Taking Advantage of the Concession When Shanghai entered a serious period but was not at war, the Public Concession Bureau and the naval commanders of the United Kingdom and the United States consulted on deployment methods, stipulating that the Japanese Marine Corps would defend the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas. Therefore, the Japanese Marine Corps used the concession as a talisman and suddenly attacked the Chinese area at about 12:00 AM the night before last. The Chinese army stationed in the Chinese area was suddenly attacked unexpectedly, and they were very angry. It was heard that the Chinese authorities considered this method of the concession authorities to be unfair and regretted it, intending to lodge a protest. Firmly Defending the Wusong Fort Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, a Westerner returned to Shanghai from Wusong and told a reporter that an hour before he left Wusong, Japanese warships began to bombard the fort. When he left Wusong, the Japanese warships' artillery fire had not stopped. According to another source, Wusong is safe and there is no war. The Wusong Fort is still firmly defended by our army. Japanese Army Landing at Bailonggang The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau urgently reported last night by the Chuansha County Defense Corps, stating that on the afternoon of the 29th, two Japanese warships suddenly came to the Bailonggang Sea, and hundreds of marines landed. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has forwarded the report to the army authorities, sending teams to intercept them.</p>
<h3>Record from the "Ta Mei Evening News"</h3>
<p>"Ta Mei Evening News" reports that, due to the repeated bombing by Japanese aircraft, the North Railway Station caught fire at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 29th). It is said that a train was hit by a bomb, but the reason is unknown. There are currently four major fires in Zhabei, and they are still burning. Japanese soldiers are making every effort to occupy the area. As a result of the fighting in Zhabei up to yesterday afternoon, both sides suffered heavy casualties, and property losses are enormous. The Chinese people are in a state of extreme panic. Japanese soldiers have not yet occupied Zhabei. Currently, the center of the battle is at the North Railway Station, which is guarded by Guangdong soldiers and constantly attacked by two Japanese aircraft. Rumors of the fall of the Wusong Fort are false. Japanese soldiers do not appear to have attacked the fort yet. The reserve troops of the 19th Route Army departed from Nanjing for Shanghai this morning to strengthen Shanghai's defenses. The masses gathered at the railway station to warmly welcome them. According to Japanese authorities at noon today, the total number of Japanese soldiers killed and wounded to date is one hundred. Those wounded are being treated at field hospitals. The Commercial Press in Zhabei suffered significant damage due to a fire caused by aircraft bombs. The number of Chinese soldiers killed and wounded is unknown. It is reported that many civilians were also killed and wounded. This morning's fighting took place around the North Railway Station. Two Japanese aircraft repeatedly dropped bombs, but it is unknown how many hit their targets. However, the Chinese soldiers showed no weakness and did not retreat an inch. When the aircraft approached, the Chinese soldiers fired at them with Lee-Enfield rifles and small cannons. Several Japanese aircraft bombs fell on the open space of the station, and the rest fell on the civilian houses in the Baoshan district, causing several fires, including at the Commercial Press. The Zhabei Fire Brigade was ordered to evacuate at 10:00 AM this morning, so the fire was left unattended. Thick smoke filled the sky. Both the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) and Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou) railways have suspended service since yesterday afternoon. Government officials, hearing that Japanese soldiers intended to attack Chinese territory, moved all trains and locomotives to Suzhou. The troops defending the North Station are those who arrived from Beijing in the past two days. Currently, in addition to these troops, most of the forces of Dai Ji, the Songhu Garrison Commander, have retreated to the Longhua-Hongqiao area. Dai's headquarters has moved to the Hongqiao airfield. He Yingqin, the Minister of War, arrived in Shanghai yesterday to arrange defenses and boost morale. The Chinese soldiers currently defending the North Railway Station and the surrounding area are all willing to swear an oath to resist the Japanese soldiers to the death. Twelve Japanese warships that arrived from Sasebo yesterday morning were initially anchored outside the mouth of Wusong, and then sailed into the Huangpu River and anchored outside the Common Concession, outside the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau. A Chinese gunboat anchored there set sail for Nanjing this morning. The Common Concession and the French Concession are as peaceful as usual this morning. At 12:35 PM today, a Japanese aircraft was shot down over Zhabei by Chinese anti-aircraft guns positioned on rooftops. The location where the plane crashed burst into flames. Around 4:00 AM this morning, Japanese soldiers were in a precarious situation due to a lack of sandbags. Later, Japanese civilians gathered at the Japanese Club on Peng Road, the Japanese Consulate General, North Sichuan Road, the Taoshan Dance Hall, and the Japanese Elementary School in the Northern District to fill sandbags. They were then rushed to the front lines by trucks loaded with Marines. This morning, only the North Railway Station area was not occupied by Japanese soldiers. Although one Japanese aircraft fiercely bombed it at 4:30 AM, the damage was minimal. The station is still under the control of Chinese soldiers. The defenders of the station are an elite Chinese regiment determined to fight to the death against the Japanese soldiers' attack. As of noon, the Japanese soldiers had not attempted to attack. The Chinese soldiers' defensive works are currently behind sandbags. Japanese military officials said that the reason they have not yet prepared to attack the station is that the Chinese soldiers outnumber the Japanese soldiers, and the Japanese soldiers are only equipped with rifles and machine guns. However, Japanese soldiers are currently rushing to build sandbag fortifications on various roads in the Tongbei Railway Station area. The Wusong Fort is still in the hands of Chinese soldiers. It is reported that Deng Zhenquan, the commander of the fort, has ordered nearby small boats to sail away, apparently preparing to respond to attacks from Japanese warships and aircraft. At 11:00 AM this morning, the Shanghai Harbor Authority received a telegram from the Wusong Fort radio station stating that Wusong was as quiet as usual. Japanese aircraft had flown over Wusong, but did not drop any bombs. This morning, the New Beijing and Ningshao merchant ships sailed safely through the mouth of Songjiang from Ningbo. Early this morning, a Japanese aircraft dropped a bomb that landed near the Jin Li Yuan Wharf in the French Concession, injuring three coolies and one warehouse inspector. However, the damage was minimal. The coolies loading and unloading goods on the shore then refused to work. It is reported that the inspector's injuries are very serious.</p>
<p>Airmail and passenger services have been suspended today. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation is very concerned about the aircraft of the company parked at the Hongkou airfield. At noon today, efforts were made to communicate with the airfield, but all were unsuccessful. It is reported that Japanese aircraft have flown over the airfield, and the roads leading to the airfield are all blocked. An employee of the Commercial Press informed the "Ta Mei Evening News" by telephone that Japanese aircraft bombs fell on the printing rooms, warehouses, and main buildings of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road this morning, causing fires in the vicinity of the press. It was reported that a policeman was injured early this morning. This morning, reporters from the "Ta Mei Evening News" went to North Henan Road and Bazi Road to observe the sandbag fortifications built by Japanese soldiers. The sandbags were piled very well, forming a semi-circle, shoulder-high. The soldiers guarding the area held Lee-Enfield rifles and leaned against the sandbags, able to remain vigilant for hours. A bomb or shell landed at No. 24 Zha Pu Road, near Kunshan Road, causing a large hole in the roof and making the inside of the house a mess. The residents on the top floor of the house were the Wolley Jin Lashi family. Jin Lashi was sick in the neighbor's room and had a nurse attending to her. Fortunately, they were not injured. They were rescued by others in the house, but their nerves were greatly shaken. A bomb also landed at No. 77 Wa'er Bai Liyilong on Zha Pu Road. The resident of the house was the Pei Li La family, and the inside of the house was severely damaged. Mr. Marks, a member of the Volunteer Corps, had fortunately left the room in uniform moments before, thus escaping injury. At 12:30 PM today, a small-scale conflict broke out in the Hongkou district. It is reported that many Chinese people in the Peng Road area near North Sichuan Road were stabbed by Japanese soldiers with bayonets and hit with rifle butts. Mr. Ross, an American businessman, witnessed several Chinese people being treated in this way. Conflicts between Chinese people and Japanese sailors have also occurred frequently elsewhere in Hongkou, resulting in injuries.</p>
<p>The French Consul Lodge a Protest. The French Consul-General stationed in Shanghai, due to the fact that Japanese military aircraft dropped several bombs in the French Concession yesterday morning, causing alarm and disorder among the residents of the concession, expressed his dissatisfaction and lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Consul on the same day.</p>
<p>Two Japanese Warships Headed to Beijing Yesterday. Two Japanese destroyers belonging to the 23rd unit of the First Torpedo Squadron suddenly left Shanghai at noon yesterday. It is reported that they have sailed to Nanjing and are about to take action.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Important Telegrams</h3>
<p>Cai Tingkai Reports to the Government. Reuters reported on the Shanghai war situation on the 29th. At 4:00 PM today, Nanjing received an official report from the Shanghai National Army Headquarters, bearing the name of Cai Tingkai, the commander of the 19th Route Army, who is in charge of the anti-Japanese war in Zhabei today. It stated, "Our army has shot down seven Japanese aircraft. Japanese aircraft destroyed one locomotive and three train carriages with bombs. Our army also captured three Japanese armored vehicles. Our army suffered a total of 300 casualties. At 4:00 PM, the Japanese army retreated. The printing house of the Commercial Press was completely destroyed by Japanese aircraft bombs. This is the greatest loss in the war, etc."</p>
<h3>Circular Telegram from Military Commanders</h3>
<p>Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and Dai Ji issued a circular telegram yesterday, saying: "Extremely Urgent, to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, all ministries and commissions, the Shanghai Garrison Commander, all levels of Party Headquarters, governments, all army, division, brigade, and regimental commanders, all newspapers, and the national public: The violent Japanese have occupied our Northeast provinces, changing the color of our territory, and our nation is on the verge of extinction. Recently, they have been killing and arson in Shanghai. The actions of the ronin are the most despicable and brutal in the world. Warships have arrived one after another, and all the marines have landed, blatantly invading our defense lines in Zhabei, Shanghai, at 12:00 AM on the 28th, and provoking us. Guangnai and others are military personnel, and only know that it is our duty to defend ourselves, protect our territory, and safeguard our land. We cannot give up an inch of land or a blade of grass. For the sake of saving the country and protecting our race, even if we sacrifice the last soldier and the last bullet, we will never retreat, so as not to lose the personality of the soldiers of the Republic of China. This is our heart and our will, which is witnessed by heaven and earth and revealed to the world. The spirits of the Yan and Huang ancestors in heaven are truly our witnesses. Jiang Guangnai, Commander-in-Chief of the 19th Route Army; Cai Tingkai, Commander of the 19th Army; Dai Ji, Songhu Garrison Commander, bows, Seal."</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Speech. Mayor Wu spoke about the Japanese army's attack on the Chinese Defense Forces in Zhabei the night before, saying, "I initially thought that sacrificing myself could save Shanghai. Since the Japanese army's unprovoked attack on the Chinese Defense Forces in Zhabei last night (that is, the night before), the Japanese Consul General and the Japanese warship commander's unbelievable and contradictory actions have truly awakened me from my delusion. The Japanese Consul's response to the municipal government showed satisfaction and was even announced to the consular corps. I thought that the imminent threat of disaster had suddenly vanished. I endured humiliation and sought complete preservation, hoping to be understood by China and foreign countries. Unexpectedly, a few hours later, the Japanese fleet commander suddenly issued a general notice in the middle of the night and simultaneously began military operations, attacking our garrison, bombing prosperous streets, and harming the lives and property of innocent people. For example, the editing department of the Commercial Press, entrusted with Oriental culture, and its ancient books and rare editions were all reduced to ashes. The losses are incalculable. This responsibility should be borne entirely by the Japanese side. Yesterday, I lodged a serious protest and notified the consuls-general of various countries stationed in Shanghai to uphold justice. Matters have reached this point, what else can I say? Fortunately, the people of the country can enlighten and teach me."</p>
<p>Our Army Declares to the Shanghai Municipal Council. The Guowen News Agency reports that, according to sources close to the military authorities, Cai Tingkai, commander of the 19th Route Army, stated that the Japanese Marines intentionally provoked war without declaring it, forcibly occupying the North Sichuan Road area of the Public Concession and engaging our army in street fighting. For defensive purposes, we have no choice but to declare to the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council that our army is preparing to attack the Japanese defense lines on North Sichuan Road, and we have no choice but to do so for self-defense. It is reported that the declaration was issued around 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Sun Ke and Others Jointly Telegram Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek to Remain in Shanghai. Eleven Central Committee members, including Sun Ke, jointly telegraphed Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek yesterday, requesting that elite troops be transferred to Shanghai for support and that funds be provided to the 19th Route Army. The original telegram is recorded below: "To Mr. Wang Jingwei and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, and to all comrades of the Central Committee: Confidential. The Japanese are so tyrannical that the military and civilians are indignant and vow to resist to the death. From last night to this afternoon, the battle has been fierce. Our army's morale is a hundredfold and has repeatedly won victories. At this time, the government should embrace the determination to rather be a shattered jade than an intact tile to repay the country and thank the people. Comrades in Shanghai have seen and heard everything clearly. It has been decided that the Central Committee should immediately order the armies near the capital to transfer elite troops to Shanghai for support and make every effort to provide the 19th Route Army with military supplies and funds. We send this telegram urgently, hoping that you will consider it and reply by telegram. Sun Ke, Li Zongren, Liu Lu Yin, Li Wenfan, Cheng Qian, Zhang Fakui, Chen Youren, Ma Chaojun, Fu Rulin, Chen Qingyun, Liang Hanchao."</p>
<p>Sun Ke and Others Send Telegrams to Various Organizations. Sun Ke and others sent a circular telegram yesterday, saying: "This time, the Japanese have launched a riot in Shanghai, burned the Sanyou Factory, and engaged in wanton provocations. They have also issued an ultimatum to the Shanghai Municipal Government, demanding the dissolution of our national anti-Japanese patriotic organizations as a condition. Their strength and unreasonableness are intolerable to all our people. However, the government has always adhered to a policy of passivity and non-resistance, and still lowered its head and bowed down, completely accepting their demands, thinking that such submission would avoid disaster. How could they know that the Japanese ambition to gain an inch and seek a foot has long become a habit? The weaker we show ourselves, the stronger they become. The more we retreat, the more they advance. The result of non-resistance will inevitably lead to the pain of national subjugation. Comrades have long considered this and have made repeated declarations, which we hope you will consider. Last night, after receiving the Shanghai Municipal Government's reply of complete surrender, the Japanese army actually went on to demand that our local officials withdraw the garrison in Zhabei. They then attacked Zhabei and allowed their residents to set fire to and destroy the Commercial Press. The facts of various looting and encroachments are endless. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army soldiers garrisoning Songhu vowed to fulfill their duty to defend the territory and resisted to the death. Since yesterday until now, our army's grief and anger have been overflowing, and their morale has been a hundredfold. They have shot down four enemy aircraft and captured three armored vehicles. They are still in fierce fighting. The entire Shanghai population has gone on strike and is also indignant and unwilling to live, vowing to resist the invaders to the death. At this critical moment of national crisis and survival, we rely on all the people of our country to embrace the determination to rather be a shattered jade than an intact tile and to deal with the enemy. Only in this way can we fight for national dignity and seek survival for the nation. Otherwise, if we sit and wait for death, the country and nation will inevitably fall into a state of eternal perdition. Comrades feel a sense of crisis and find it difficult to remain silent. In addition to telegraphing the government and the troops near Beijing and Shanghai for urgent support, we also urge all our national people and soldiers to awaken and prepare for resistance together, go to the national crisis together. This is what we hope for. We write this telegram in pain and anger, hoping that you will understand. Sun Ke, Li Zongren, Chen Youren, Ma Chaojun, Zhang Fakui, Cheng Qian, Xue Dubi, Chen Qingyun, Liu Luyin, Liang Hanchao, Fu Rulin, Fang Zhenwu, Li Wenfan, Huang Jide, He Shizhen, Sun Jingya, Xiong Kewu, Bai Chongxi."</p>
<h3>Public Opinion of Western Newspapers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both the local "Continental Daily News" and the "Ta Mei Evening News" carried editorials criticizing the Japanese soldiers' attack on Zhabei. Due to space limitations, the following is a summary translation of their warnings: "The Continental Daily News" said, "The Japanese soldiers' unprovoked attack on Zhabei last night has removed their mask and exposed their true will. The ink on the Chinese authorities' document accepting the Japanese demands was not yet dry, and Japanese Consul General Murai had guaranteed that the Chinese reply was satisfactory, but this violent act was carried out again, which is beyond human understanding. It is no longer doubtful that Japan is determined to disregard international public opinion in order to conquer all of China."</p>
<p>"The Ta Mei Evening News" said, "The Chinese authorities have completely and unconditionally accepted Japan's demands, and the Japanese Consul General has expressed satisfaction. Logically, we should wait and see what happens in the future. If Mayor Wu proves to be insincere or unable to fulfill his promises, then we must consider and create a new situation. Now, after forcing complete acceptance, they are resorting to force, which is a major blow to the Chinese people. Mayor Wu's actions were of great moral courage, but within a few hours, the Japanese took military action. This is a painful blow to the Chinese authorities, who were trying to reconcile through peaceful negotiations. From Japan's own point of view, occupying Zhabei is the most tragic of the great mistakes Japan has made since September 18. This move directly harms the interests of Japan and other countries in China and makes those of the same kind support it. It has also swept away Japan's glorious reputation and international credibility. Indirectly, it is tantamount to endorsing the attitude of extremists. Regardless of Japan's explanations, the events of yesterday afternoon and last night prove that the power of Japanese civilians has been trampled on by warlords, etc."</p>
<h3>Chinese Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council Lodge a Protest</h3>
<p>Chinese Directors Held a Meeting Yesterday. In view of the fact that the Japanese Marines launched an attack on our country's garrison the night before, and the situation is serious, the Chinese Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Liu Hongsheng, Hu Mengjia, Yuan Ludeng, etc., convened leaders from various industries at No. 4 Hong Kong Road Bank Association at 12:00 AM yesterday to discuss the matter together. It was decided on the spot that the five Chinese Directors would issue a letter in their names to the Chairman, lodging a serious protest, and also send a letter to Consul General Ke Yinhang, urging him to stop the matter immediately. The letter to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated,</p>
<p>Chinese Directors Issued Two Important Letters. The Chinese Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council sent a letter to the Chairman yesterday in their capacity as directors, saying, "Dear Sir, it is reported that the Japanese Marines departed from the concession at midnight on January 28 to carry out acts of war against our country's garrison. It is impossible to predict how the scope of the danger will expand. This bureau, in order to maintain security within the concession and strictly maintain a neutral attitude, decided yesterday to declare a state of emergency and entrust the responsibility of maintaining security in the Hongkou area to the Japanese army. Now, Japan is carrying out the above-mentioned acts of war, and is using the area it is responsible for maintaining security as a launching point for acts of war. This kind of action is destroying the neutrality of the Shanghai Public Concession and should be stopped immediately by this bureau. We should also hold them responsible for destroying neutrality. We are lodging a serious protest for this reason. To Chairman Mackinnon. We are also sending a letter to the leading consuls, saying, 'Dear Sirs, it is reported that the Japanese Marines departed from the Public Concession at midnight on January 28 to carry out acts of war against our country's garrison. It is impossible to predict how the scope of the danger will expand. The Shanghai Public Concession, in order to maintain security within the concession and strictly maintain a neutral state, decided yesterday to declare a state of emergency and entrust the responsibility of maintaining security in the Hongkou area to the Japanese army. Now, Japan is carrying out the above-mentioned acts of war, and is using the area it is responsible for maintaining security as a launching point for acts of war. This kind of action is destroying the neutrality of the Shanghai Public Concession and should be stopped immediately. In addition to making a direct statement, we are sending this letter to request that you take effective measures quickly to stop the matter and hold them responsible for destroying neutrality. With kind regards, to Mr. Ke Yinhang, Consul General of the United States in Shanghai, Leading Consul.'</p>
<h3>Important News from the Shanghai Citizens' Federation</h3>
<p>Representatives Visited Feixin Dunn Yesterday. The Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation sent representatives Wang Hanliang, Zhang Yichen, Yu Zhongxian, and Wang Zhaocheng to the Shanghai Municipal Council at 3:00 PM yesterday to meet with Director Feixin Dunn. Translated by the director, He De Kui, the representatives first stated that the Japanese soldiers were using the concession as a talisman, rushing out of the concession when they acted, and retreating into the concession when they were defeated. This situation violated the original intention of the concession to maintain peace and neutrality, and effective measures should be taken to suppress this, etc. Mr. Fei replied, "Regarding this matter, I spoke to the British and American consuls general a week ago, asking them to quickly send nearby naval forces for protection, but this has not been implemented. Now that a major incident has occurred, the consuls have all reported to their respective governments by urgent telegram, and a concrete response will probably be received soon, based on which we will take action. The representatives also asked why North Sichuan Road, North Henan Road, etc. were solely entrusted to the Japanese army to guard, and American troops should be sent to replace them. Mr. Fei replied that the war has already broken out, and it is not appropriate to discuss the issue of troop replacement. I may discuss ways with the consuls. I will also ask the Japanese consul to pass on a message to the navy not to drop bombs arbitrarily. Although the Japanese consul has agreed, whether it can be done is another matter, etc."</p>
<p>A Tearful Appeal to the National Salvation Army. The Shanghai Citizens' Federation urgently issued a tearful appeal to the patriotic warriors defending the territory on the front lines at 8:00 PM yesterday, because the Japanese army had requested a ceasefire from our side, saying that the federation had resolved to lead all its members to rise up as a backing force for the Chinese army. Now, it is urgently gathering its affiliated valiant army to carry out work, hoping that they will work hard for the country and advance, eliminating evil completely, etc.</p>
<h3>Shops Closed to Resist the Invaders</h3>
<p>Notice from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued a notice saying, "For the sake of informing the public, our municipal government, in order to protect the lives of millions of Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai and the commerce of friendly countries, has endured all kinds of humiliation. However, the enemy shows no remorse and suddenly, at 12:00 AM on the 28th, repeated the old trick of occupying Shenyang and engaged in wanton slaughter. Their actions will surely cause the destruction of the number one city in Asia, and they will not be happy until it is completely ruined. At this point, our merchants and citizens have no choice but to embrace the determination to perish with the enemy and close our shops together. We hereby notify the public."</p>

Therefore, shops on Nanjing Road, Fuzhou Road, Zhejiang Road, and the French Concession were all closed. A few shops that were hesitant were persuaded by the Shanghai Citizens' Federation's various district volunteer armies, and they also closed their shops to show solidarity. Therefore, after 3:00 PM, all shops in the city were closed, and all exchanges were closed. Public sentiment was aroused to the extreme.</p>
<p>The Banking Industry Also Closed.

At 2:00 PM, Wu sent Secretary-General Yu to visit the Japanese consulate, where the Japanese consul said that he had obtained the naval commander's consent. The two sides then decided on a ceasefire starting at 8:00 PM last night. However, at 9:30 PM last night, the Japanese army attacked our army again, and the fighting on Baoshan Road became intense again. Wu immediately telegraphed the Japanese consul to question him. The reply was that it was a small conflict between plainclothes troops, and there was no result from the conversation. It is reported that our side has prepared everything and will actively resist to the end no matter what.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb and Burn the Commercial Press</h3>
<p>Losses Exceed Ten Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Commercial Press's Zhabei General Factory and Editorial Department, along with the Oriental Library on Baoshan Road in Zhabei, were bombed by Japanese planes at 11:00 AM yesterday and completely burned down. Details of the bombing are recorded below: Since yesterday morning, after realizing their unfavorable situation, Japanese troops used planes to bomb the rear lines of our army. However, our army lines were dispersed, so they were not severely affected. The first time the Japanese planes took off was at 4:20 AM yesterday morning. Due to the darkness, they only circled in the air as a show of force. Around 7:00 AM, when it was brighter, another Japanese plane flew from the Huangpu River and headed to Zhabei to drop sulfur bombs. The area near the Huzhou Guild Hall was hit first. Fortunately, the explosive force was weak, and it was not severely damaged. Several other bombs landed on wasteland, so they did not affect other areas. Around 11:00 AM, the Commercial Press General Factory was also hit by a bomb, which landed in the courtyard and exploded immediately, starting a fire. All the workers in the factory had already fled. Since the fire engines were in the war zone, it was impossible to put out the fire. The fire was allowed to spread, and the flames lit up the entire city. The fire spread more easily due to the accumulation of paper. In a short time, the Editorial Department was also affected, and all kinds of printing machines were destroyed. The ashes from the burned paper flew several miles away. Even the areas around this newspaper office were affected. The Oriental Library, which was located across the street from the Commercial Press, was also engulfed by the flames and completely destroyed. The Commercial Press General Factory buildings completely collapsed around 3:00 PM, but the fire had not been completely extinguished by 5:00 PM. The Commercial Press was the only cultural organization in our country. Its general factory occupied more than 80 acres of land and has now been sacrificed for the national crisis. It is a pity. It is said that the total loss of the library is estimated to be worth about ten million yuan at current prices.</p>

<h3>Meeting of Commercial Associations in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The Business Community Has Already Implemented a Strike</p>
<p>Various Organizations Resolved to Offer Condolences</p>
<p>The General Federation of Commerce in the French Concession convened an emergency meeting of representatives from various commercial associations at 4:00 PM yesterday. Dozens of representatives attended. Shang Mujian and Cheng Zhusun were publicly elected as chairmen. The chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the Japanese troops had unreasonably demanded that our municipal government accept all unreasonable conditions. Our authorities had reluctantly and painfully agreed, hoping to avoid unexpected conflicts. Unexpectedly, the Japanese proposed unreasonable conditions and launched an attack. If we do not rise up together to resist, the tragedy of national subjugation will be imminent. Due to the business community's strike, which may affect local security, the undersigned went to the French Concession Police Headquarters yesterday (the 29th) morning to meet with Superintendent Fei. Superintendent Fei stated that he would do his best to protect the security of the concession, and hoped that the business community would remain calm and avoid self-inflicted disturbances, and that everyone would mutually maintain security in the concession. Therefore, this emergency meeting was convened to allow everyone to act with conscience and agree to resist the enemy. After discussion, the following resolutions were passed: (1) To establish a temporary committee to maintain security within the concession; (2) To inform all businesses to maintain order and avoid self-inflicted disturbances; (3) To take unified action with all sectors regarding the strike; (4) Since the Japanese troops are using the concession as a shield, the concession authorities should be asked to disarm the Japanese troops to comply with the principle of neutrality; (5) Regarding the 19th Route Army's armed comrades, who were strictly prepared for defense beforehand and worked hard to resist and protect the area afterward, this association should prepare supplies to offer condolences. The representatives of each district enthusiastically expressed their support, which shows that the people are united and enthusiastic. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Four Organizations Telegraph Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Feng Yuxiang</h3>
<p>Urging Unity and Firm Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation, the Shanghai All-Circles Commercial Federation, the Shanghai General Federation of Commerce, and the China National Salvation Association jointly telegraphed the National Government and central committee members Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and Feng Yuxiang: Ignoring international conventions, the Japanese, who violently invaded our three northeastern provinces, after being satisfied with the city government's reply, suddenly launched a military riot in Shanghai, where commercial gatherings of various countries are held, on the evening of the 28th, engaging in banditry. As a result, the National Defense soldiers were forced by righteous indignation to exercise their legitimate right of defense. The people of the city have resolved to strike and resist the enemy and will act as a support. We urge you to make a decisive decision to adopt a firm resistance policy and order the entire country to prepare in unison to fulfill the responsibility of saving the country and preserving the race. Survival is at stake. Please do not delay any longer. We urgently await your decision. Respectfully submitted on January 29th, the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>

The telegram is choked with emotion and filled with grief and indignation.</p>
<h3>A Detailed Account of 16 Hours of Fierce Fighting Amidst Artillery Fire</h3>
<p>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs Ferociously, Our Army Fights Bravely to Protect Merchants and Civilians</p>
<p>At 11:00 PM on the 28th, Japanese troops launched an attack on our army from the direction of North Sichuan Road. The 19th Army defended itself and responded calmly. From 11:00 PM until dawn, the sounds of gunfire and artillery continued without interruption. At 5:00 AM yesterday morning, during a heavy downpour, the Japanese air force sent three bombers to Zhabei, randomly dropping bombs and causing extensive damage to buildings. The reporter's residence, Huaxingli, was located in the line of fire between the Chinese and Japanese armies. Bullets flew overhead at night, and the danger was indescribable. Yesterday morning, Japanese planes randomly dropped bombs, shaking the buildings. The reporter's house was also bombed. The reporter risked his life to escape amidst the artillery fire, trying to cross the line of fire twice, but was unable to escape due to Japanese shelling. The reporter experienced sixteen hours amidst the artillery fire. The details of what the reporter witnessed are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Fierceness of the Battle the Previous Night</p>
<p>At 11:00 PM the previous night, Japanese troops first sent two artillery vehicles to East Baoxing Road and Guangdong Street on North Sichuan Road. A large squad of naval infantry also advanced in skirmishes, crossing the Songhu Railway tracks. Our side only took defensive action, so the police responded first. The Japanese troops pressed forward, and our side initially responded with Mauser pistols. The gunfire moved from north to south, from sparse to dense. When approaching Qiujiang Road near Baoyou Road, our army began to respond with machine guns. The Japanese troops gradually retreated north, and the gunfire gradually moved from south to north. Around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese troops who had invaded Baoshan Road were driven back to North Sichuan Road. The Japanese suffered many casualties in this battle.</p>
<p>The First Japanese Bombing</p>
<p>Around dawn, about 5:00 AM, it was raining heavily, and a grinding sound came from the sky. First, one plane came, followed by three. The Japanese used searchlights to illuminate the planes. When the Japanese planes arrived, our troops stopped firing. The Japanese planes could not find their targets in the darkness, so the three planes circled in the air over Zhabei for an hour. At dawn, they dropped a bomb. With a loud bang, the surrounding houses shook. It was reported that the Huzhou Guild Hall had been bombed. Then, they flew to the entrance of Hongxingfang Sandeli, intending to bomb the Kuomintang district branch. However, due to inaccurate bombing, they bombed two civilian houses on Xiangshan Road. The reporter's house was shaken and nearly collapsed. As it was getting brighter, the reporter risked his life to escape from Huaxingli with his wife and daughters. The sections around Yongxing Road were piled with sandbags and were impassable.</p>
<p>Our Army's Effective Response</p>
<p>This battle was purely a defensive battle fought by the 19th Route Army. When the Japanese planes came to bomb Shanghai North yesterday morning, there were initially no anti-aircraft guns. Only mortars and rifles were used for shooting. Around 9:00 AM, our side transferred a regiment and brought several anti-aircraft guns. The reporter wanted to cross the line of fire and go to North Sichuan Road. On the Xiangshan Road side, the reporter accompanied the 19th Route Army to the Jiang Road when the Japanese began machine-gunning. The 19th Route Army advised the reporter to turn back west to find a way out. The people who were fleeing were protected by the 19th Route Army, who advised them not to gather when they saw Japanese planes flying overhead. They also helped clear the obstructed traffic. Their sincerity in protecting the people and the strictness of their military discipline are among the best in our country's army. When the Japanese planes came a second time, our side had anti-aircraft guns and shot down one plane. The remaining two planes changed to high-altitude flying and did not dare to drop bombs.</p>
<p>The Japanese Planes' Inhumanity</p>
<p>After 10:00 AM, the Japanese planes, fearing our anti-aircraft guns, changed direction and randomly dropped bombs on the merchants and civilians in the markets in the western part of Zhabei. When they saw a large number of refugees in Beinanlinli, the Japanese planes dropped a bomb, killing many refugees. Because the iron gates everywhere were locked, many refugees took boats across the Suzhou Creek to the British Concession. Most commendably, the Westerners and workers of the Shanghai Water and Fire Company helped rescue the refugees. About tens of thousands of people went ashore. A Japanese plane dropped a bomb at the Jinliyuan No. 8 pier of the French Concession, injuring one inspector and two workers from the company. Another bomb was dropped in front of the Taifeng shipping ticket office on Xin Kaihe, injuring one rickshaw puller, one worker, and one passerby. In the afternoon, they used incendiary bombs and dropped them everywhere, causing major fires in the Commercial Press and other places.</p>
<p>The Telephone Bureau Was Destroyed by Fire</p>
<p>The China Telephone Branch Bureau in Shuangshili, East Baoxing Road, had twenty female operators. When the fighting broke out the previous night, the bureau was located in the line of fire. Yesterday morning, during the fierce battle, Chen Yaqin, the squad leader, saw that the staff would be buried in the fire and asked the head office to take everyone to the Keming Road branch to take temporary shelter. Unexpectedly, a plane dropped a bomb and destroyed Chen's house. The twenty operators were almost killed. It was not until 3:00 PM that they escaped amidst the shelling. All their belongings were lost.</p>
<h3>Japanese Drop Bombs Everywhere</h3>
<p>Bombings in the Nanshi Area Five Times</p>
<p>After dropping bombs in various parts of the French Concession from 7:00 AM yesterday, the Japanese planes flew back to their mothership. At noon, they flew to Nanshi again and dropped bombs in several places in the Chinese area. (1) At 1:10 PM, they circled in the sky above the Chenghuang Temple in the city for a long time and dropped a bomb that landed on the roof of the Ganshunxing firewood shop at the entrance of Guanyi Lane. It rolled off the drying platform and exploded, injuring two people: Zhu Asheng, a 42-year-old Shaoxing native who was the shop's old clerk, was injured in the foot; and a Jiangyin native, 58-year-old Zhang nanny, was injured in the left foot. They were sent to Shanghai Hospital. (2) At 1:20 PM, a bomb landed in the Xin Kaihe area, injuring a rickshaw puller who fainted. He was taken to the hospital and later regained consciousness.

<h3>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs in the Zhabei Area</h3>
<p>(Zhenru Radio Station)</p>
<p>At 12:30 PM yesterday, Japanese planes dropped a bomb on the east side of the Zhenru Radio Station, but there was no major damage. Around 3:00 PM, Japanese planes continued to drop bombs twice, but there were no accidents.</p>
<p>(Huzhou Guild Hall)</p>
<p>After 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, the public discovered a Japanese person in the vicinity of Zhonghuiwen Road near Qiujiang Road in Zhabei interrogating the Chinese. Soldiers of our 78th Division learned of this and persuaded him to go to the group headquarters of the nearby Huzhou Guild Hall. After searching and questioning him, the Japanese person said that he had mistakenly entered the Chinese area. The group headquarters then ordered soldiers to escort him to the concession on Qiujiang Road and instructed him not to rashly enter our Chinese area again. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, at 2:00 or 3:00 AM, the Huzhou Guild Hall was bombed by Japanese troops, destroying several buildings.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Drop Bombs in the Pudong Area</h3>
<p>(Fenshan Pier)</p>
<p>Around 6:10 AM yesterday morning, a ferry at Fenshan Pier in Pudong was carrying passengers from the Hongkou Pier on the opposite bank. As the passengers were about to disembark, due to the large number of people, a Japanese plane dropped a bomb, which fortunately landed in the Pudong river. The water splashed up to a height of ten feet, and no one was injured.</p>
<p>(Lujiazui)</p>
<p>At the same time, at the Longmao Foreign Company Pier in Lujiazui, Pudong, the company's Gonghe steamer arrived. Workers were unloading cargo when a Japanese plane dropped a bomb, which landed in the water next to the ship, but no one was injured.</p>
<p>(Old Ferry Terminal)</p>
<p>The entrance to the Old Ferry Terminal in Pudong, located between the Japanese Nisshin Company, has always had commercial ferry services traveling between Pudong East and West, carrying passengers. It is an important ferry terminal in Pudong. Unexpectedly, the Japanese naval vessel Fuji arrived at the Nisshin Company pier the day before, and sailors landed at the same time. That evening, they piled sandbags and barbed wire on the ferry terminal avenue (i.e., Old Ferry Terminal Road) and sent several sailors to defend it, cutting off east-west traffic at that location. As a result, the ferry service was suspended, and the police stationed at the ferry terminal were withdrawn to avoid conflict. Many Japanese soldiers were also stationed on the roof of the Nisshin Company's warehouse, watching, creating a very bad situation.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Casualties</h3>
<p>Li Fan, a 27-year-old woman from Chongming, residing in Wangjiazhai, Zhabei, was crossing the river from Beibin to Binnan in a small sampan around 10:00 PM last night when she was spotted by the troops stationed on the south bank, who opened fire on the boat, hitting her in the right leg.

<p>[P Rescue Teams Intensify Their Work</p>
<p>The Red Cross Bravely Rescues</p>
<p>Wang Peiyuan, the captain of the Chinese Red Cross rescue team, prepared for rescue efforts after the outbreak of war. Yesterday morning, the entire team set off and rescued several injured civilians in Nanshi. At 9:00 AM, Secretary Ji Zhuqing, along with doctors Wang Zhenchuan and Geng Guoxiang, head nurses Jin Weizeng and Qin Ruiting, and servants, went to the North Railway Station. Because the iron gate was closed, they went to the station from Beigaoshouli. At that time, the Japanese soldiers were charging, and the Japanese soldiers used artillery cover and dropped bombs from planes. Our army used anti-aircraft guns to shoot upwards. Five bombs landed one after another, destroying the ambulance. Volunteer rescuer Dong Xinqin and the nurses of the association were moving the wounded when they were less than a minute away from the site. It was fortunate that they were not affected.</p>
<p>The Blue Cross Expands the Rescue Team</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Zhabei, the Qianyi Traumatic Surgery Hospital of the Blue Cross Society has organized a rescue team to carry out rescue operations separately. However, Wang Binyan, the director of the Zhabei Charity Group, realizing that the strength was weak and insufficient for distribution, organized three rescue teams with the original staff of the Charity Group and the Security Group, together with the established rescue team, making a total of four teams, and sent them to the front line for rescue. The Zhabei Charity Group served as a temporary shelter.</p>
<p>Baolong Hospital Organizes a Rescue Team</p>
<p>The Baolong Hospital on Baker Road in the Public Concession organized a rescue team to carry medicine to the battlefield for rescue at 8:30 this morning. The rescue team consists of about ten people.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special District Municipal Federation of Citizens said that there were too many women and children refugees on each road, and they had no home to return to and no place to shelter. Yesterday, they assigned representatives to contact Jing'an Temple, Qingliang Temple, Dawang Temple, and Renji Hall to establish shelters separately.</p>
<p>Muer Church Scouts Organize a Rescue Team</p>
<p>The Muer Church Scout Group, led by Group Leader Wang Gang and Huang Tiren, led all the group members to organize a rescue team and rescued hundreds of refugees, who were housed in the Muer Church. Due to the lack of quilts, they borrowed fifty military blankets from the Jinrong Public School Scout Group.</p>
<p>The Education Sector Relieves the Disasters</p>
<p>The violent Japanese invaded the territory, and the victims were displaced. The Shanghai Education Sector National Salvation Federation felt sad and discussed with Madam Huang Keqiang and Huang Shaolan, the principal of Bowen Girls' Middle School, to contact various schools and accommodate the victims as much as possible during this critical period. Most schools have sympathized with this.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Condolences from All Parties</h3>
<p>The 78th Division Sets Up an Office</p>
<p>The Chinese people, in view of the valiant defense of the 78th Division, which won honor for the nation, and the ladies of the rear, who have organized comfort teams or donated to the soldiers to express their patriotic enthusiasm, during the military period, the headquarters of the 78th Division was relocated indefinitely. The Ministry then appointed a responsible commissioner, who specifically borrowed the original site of the New World National Products Shopping Mall on Nanjing Road to set up an office for contact with all parties for condolences and supplies, which can be sent directly to that office.</p>
<p>Sun Ke Condoles with 100,000 Yuan</p>

<p>Cheng Shangfeng Donates Salary to Comfort Cheng Shangfeng, a judge of the First Special District Court, sent his monthly salary of 296.46 yuan to this newspaper yesterday to be forwarded to the 19th Route Army. Cheng's letter said, "To the National People of the Shenbao: The eastern provinces have fallen, and Shanghai and Nanjing are in alarm. The authorities are only succumbing to the enemy, and the important officials of the party and the country are fleeing behind. Only the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, under the guidance of Jiang, Cai, and Dai, are sacrificing themselves to save the country and defending the territory, extending great righteousness in times of crisis, and fighting alone in a situation of impending doom. Anyone with a little humanity should rise up and contribute money and effort to help the righteous army. I believe that if we Chinese do not rise up voluntarily to contribute wealth and strength to help the righteous army, then not only will the country not be a country, but people will not be human. I am weak and powerless and have little resources, so I am willing to donate all of my monthly salary of 296.46 yuan to the army. I ask the Shenbao to forward it, not daring to be a leader for the world, but only to fulfill my personal duty. Writing this, I am in tears. I humbly ask for your understanding. Cheng Shangfeng bows, January 29th."</p>
<p>Private Contributions to Comfort After the Japanese navy advanced on our 19th Route Army, the citizens of this city were extremely indignant, and they admired the unyielding patriotic spirit of the 19th Route Army. Yesterday, Cantonese Hu Xingyan, Tan Ciqin, Chen Xianchu, and Chen Muxia raised 1,470 yuan for comfort, which has been handed over to the Bank Association for safekeeping and will be transferred to the army today.

<h3>Western Paint Industry Sends 5,000 Loaves of Bread</h3>

A letter to the Chamber of Commerce said: "The Japanese naval landing force has brazenly attacked Zhabei, setting fires and massacring people, which is extremely infuriating.

They adjourned the meeting at 9:00 pm and immediately set off to solicit money or food from the shops, which they transported to Zhabei to comfort the soldiers and encourage their morale.

<h3>Defense of the French Concession and International Settlement</h3>
<p>The International Settlement Has Strong Defense Since the Municipal Council announced martial law at 4:00 pm the day before yesterday, the troops of various countries have been dividing up the area for defense, which is very strict. The commander of all the defense forces is Fei Liming, the commander of the British army stationed in Shanghai. The area of defense has been seen in yesterday's newspaper. The number of these defense forces is about 10,000. In addition, there are the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the police of the Municipal Council to help maintain law and order. Armored vehicles patrol the streets from time to time for defense.</p>

<p>French Concession Imposes Emergency Martial Law In the French Concession, after the Japanese planes dropped bombs in the concession, the residents were panicked. The French authorities were extremely angry. They immediately lodged a serious protest with the Japanese consulate and actively prepared for defense, announcing an emergency martial law, ordering all iron sheds to be completely closed, and all entertainment venues and cinemas in the Great World to be closed. The security was even stricter at night. Pedestrians without special passes were not allowed to pass.</p>
<p>South City Strengthens Guard After the battle in Zhabei the night before last, the police officers of the first and second districts of the Municipal Public Security Bureau in the South City and the chiefs of the various sub-bureaus immediately implemented martial law and cut off traffic. Traffic was not restored until 7:00 am yesterday, but defenses were still tightened. In addition to sending double posts within the area, the district offices also ordered the chiefs and police officers not to leave the area without authorization during off-duty hours, so that they could be summoned immediately when necessary. Along the Pujiang River, the army piled up trees, bean cakes, and other defensive materials to prepare for battle.</p>
<p>Strict Defense in West Shanghai The residents in the Caojiadu area of West Shanghai were terrified yesterday because of the battle in Zhabei. From the west of the Fanhangdu along the Suzhou Creek and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, British troops were deployed to defend the area. The bridges of the Fanhangdu Railway, Caojiadu, Houmalu, and Shanbangchang Xinqiao were all piled up with sandbags and set up with machine guns and barbed wire. From Longhua along Zhongshan Road to the Jungong Road in Zhabei, the 19th Route Army was stationed there. In Caojiadu, the entire police force of the sixth district was responsible for defending the vital points of Gisi Fei Er Road, Roberts Road, Bailinan Road, Kangnaot Road, and Jiaozhou Road, and patrol cars were constantly patrolling the area. Ren, the district chief of the sixth district branch of the Public Security Bureau of West Shanghai, was ordered to announce martial law at 6:00 pm yesterday and cut off traffic.</p>
<p>Strict Guard in Pudong On the night before last, when the Japanese soldiers attacked Zhabei, the situation in Pudong suddenly became tense. The third district of the Public Security Bureau, together with the fourth squadron of the police and the Yangjing District Defense Corps, etc., armed themselves and went out to defend the area, tightening the guard at the various crossings and strongholds. By 6:00 am yesterday, most of the shops had not yet opened. After Zhang, the district chief of the third district, separately persuaded them to operate with peace of mind, they gradually opened their doors. Fearing that villains would take the opportunity to cause trouble, the traffic on the main street of Lannidu was cut off for a while, and then pedestrians were allowed to pass after the situation eased. However, people were panicked, so the main roads at the crossings were still under strict guard all day to ensure that there would be no accidents.</p>

The Taikoo New Beijing was protected by a British warship and could still sail out. As for the China Merchants Sanbei Zhaoxing Zhengji and other Chinese merchant ships on the Yangtze River and near the sea, they did not sail at all to prevent being detained by the Japanese. The river and sea traffic in Shanghai was completely blocked.</p>
<h3>Financial News Report</h3>
<p>Yesterday, all banks, money shops, and shops in the city of Shanghai suspended business due to the Japanese soldiers invading the territory, and the financial situation in the city was slightly tight. The exchange rate of foreign currency also gradually rose. Each yuan could only be exchanged for ten silver cents. There were several exchange shops in the concession that refused to accept banknotes and only accepted cash, which caused a temporary panic, but it was quickly calmed down. However, at this time of pressing foreign troubles, there were still one or two unscrupulous merchants who took the opportunity to seek profits. It can be said that they had no heart or conscience at all.</p>
<p>Various banks in the French Concession, such as Shanghai Industrial Bank, Jincheng Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, stopped receiving and disbursing money at about 1:00 pm yesterday.

<h3>The League of Nations' Final Test</h3>
<p>Continuous Bad News from Shanghai and Harbin</p>
<p>The Newly Drafted Declaration Loses its Value</p>
<p>Yan Huiqing Proposes Articles 10 and 11 of the Covenant</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chief Chinese delegate, formally invoked Articles 10 and 11 of the League of Nations Covenant today, and reserved the right to invoke other articles as deemed necessary. According to Article 10, members undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression, the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled. Article 11 stipulates that members reserve the right to take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan Huiqing, the chief Chinese delegate, sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations today, stating: I am instructed by my government to bring the following points to your attention: (1) The dispute between China and Japan within the League of Nations arises from Japan's violation of the League of Nations Covenant and infringement upon China's territorial and administrative integrity and political independence. (2) This dispute has not yet been submitted to arbitration or legal resolution in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant. (3) This dispute has now reached a point where it may lead to an immediate rupture between China and Japan. (4) China therefore requests the application of Articles 10 and 11 of the League of Nations Covenant (which shall not diminish the plans already taken or to be taken by the League to implement its duties under Article 11, but rather augment them) to address this dispute, and formally submits this matter to the Council, earnestly requesting that appropriate and necessary action be taken under these two articles. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) China's action has placed the League of Nations in a difficult position. The public meeting of the Council, originally scheduled for this morning, has been postponed until 3:30 PM, ostensibly due to the agenda not being prepared. It is expected that the Council will discuss China's intention to invoke Articles 15 and 16 of the League of Nations Covenant this afternoon. Article 15 stipulates that the League must immediately conduct an independent investigation, which must be implemented after the investigation. Article 16 stipulates various sanctions, but these can only be applied after the two countries declare war, which has not yet occurred. The President of the Council, Paul Hymans, consulted with the other five major members this morning in private. The Council will hold a half-hour consultation before the public meeting this afternoon, without inviting representatives from China and Japan. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Upon learning of the military actions in Shanghai and Harbin, and receiving the request from the Chinese representative Yan Huiqing, the President of the League of Nations Council, Paul Hymans, immediately convened representatives from Great Britain, Italy, Germany, and other countries more directly involved in the Sino-Japanese dispute to discuss the matter. He also met with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Sir Eric Drummond, and the Deputy Secretary-General, Mr. Avenol. The Council will meet in the afternoon, and Paul Hymans will report on the situation and ask the Council to express their approval or disapproval of certain measures that have already been drafted. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Yan Huiqing, the chief Chinese delegate to the League of Nations, expressed a very strong stance regarding the Japanese military's occupation of Chinese territory in Shanghai. Mr. Yan issued a statement to reporters today, resolutely rejecting the announcement proposed by the President of the League Council, Paul Hymans, regarding the Sino-Japanese emergency issue at the next Council meeting. Mr. Yan said: "For the past four months, we have been appealing to the League of Nations, our lips and tongue have been parched and worn, but now the reports from Shanghai have arrived, showing that lips and tongues are no longer sufficient to remedy the situation. Only active measures can stop the violent actions of Japan." Therefore, Council President Paul Hymans has decided not to read the announcement at tomorrow's meeting, as the environment has rendered the declaration worthless. "However, if the Council does not wish to read the announcement, then I will only proceed according to my original plan." The so-called original plan is to propose Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, or consider proposing Articles 15 and 16. According to reliable reports, before Mr. Yan issued his statement, the Council had drafted an announcement containing the following five points: (1) Acknowledging the Open Door Policy; (2) Respecting the existing treaties between China and Japan; (3) Respecting the duties of the League Council's investigation team; (4) Reaffirming the importance of the Nine-Power Treaty; (5) Reaffirming the League Council's resolutions of September 30th and December 10th of last year. Yan Huiqing stated that the actions of the Japanese military in Liaoning, Tianjin, and Shanghai have dealt a major blow to China's trade. If the world's economic crisis is to be alleviated, the Sino-Japanese dispute must first be resolved. (Guomin News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council met today at 5:30 PM. Representatives from China and Japan were not present. After an hour of discussion, they agreed on the declaration to be read by President Paul Hymans. The original text has not yet been released to the public, but Reuters has learned that the scope of the declaration is broader than previously believed. It is said that the declaration is almost an echo of the recent American note, welcoming the American note's comments on the League's current actions, such as those regarding the potential results of the investigation team. It also states that the Washington Treaty is related to other countries, and that countries other than China and Japan also have the same relationship to the Open Door Policy. Any resolution that conflicts with the League of Nations Covenant is not permissible by the League. The declaration then specifically states Article 10 of the Covenant, according to which all countries in the Council undertake to respect and preserve territorial integrity against external aggression. The declaration concludes by stating that the longer the resolution is delayed, the more difficult it will be to achieve the resolution's objective. The Council believes that it would be pointless to pass any resolution before receiving the first report from the investigation team. A copy of this declaration will be sent to the representatives of China and Japan tonight. It is hoped that this document will satisfy the Chinese representative, Dr. Yan Huiqing, who is extremely anxious after receiving the latest news from Shanghai. The Council unanimously re-advised Secretary-General Sir Eric Drummond to withdraw his resignation, but he refused. The League has thus lost one of the individuals who has guided its destiny since its founding. Sir Eric Drummond has served for approximately thirteen years, and it is expected that he will retire early next year. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>The London League of Nations Union passed a resolution today calling on the government to take strong action to restore peace in the Far East and to uphold the authority of the League of Nations Covenant. The resolution states that the Union is willing to support such action by the government in any way it can, and that if the methods used by the League of Nations Council are insufficient to address the current serious and escalating danger, the government should propose an immediate convening of the League of Nations Assembly. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>Sudden and Severe Turn in the Shanghai Situation Stuns the US Government</h3>
<p>Expressing Skepticism Towards Tokyo's Statement</p>
<p>A Declaration Will Be Issued Soon</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government was greatly surprised to hear of the outbreak of conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops in Shanghai. They are paying close attention to news from Shanghai today. Officials here now believe that the situation in Shanghai has gradually reached a point where it will greatly harm American interests and policies. It is reported that the United States is determined to fully protect its trade rights in Shanghai. Today, Tokyo issued a statement explaining the reasons for the Japanese troops' attack on the Chinese areas of Shanghai, claiming that this action was necessary to protect the lives, property, and industries of Japanese residents. Officials here are very disapproving of this statement, saying that this explanation is just like the one issued by the Japanese troops before carrying out bandit suppression in Manchuria, the result of which was the occupation of Jinzhou. The State Department is now deeply concerned about the increasingly serious situation in Shanghai, and the people here are very worried. Therefore, a definite declaration regarding the Shanghai situation will be issued within the day. The US government has held multiple meetings to consider what actions should be taken. (Guomin News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Ronald Lindsay, held a lengthy meeting with Secretary of State Henry Stimson at his home. Although no statement regarding the discussion was released, it is clear that US officials are eager for Britain to clarify its position. According to unofficial sources, if the Japanese government considers the occupation of Shanghai to be a necessary action to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, then the United States does not wish to protest the Japanese troops' occupation. However, if the Japanese troops invade the International Settlement, the United States cannot remain silent, because the US government firmly believes that troops outside the settlement can provide all necessary protection to Japanese residents within the settlement. Washington was greatly shocked to receive news that Japan intends to blockade Shanghai, but officials do not believe this to be true, saying that a blockade is equivalent to a declaration of war and a violation of international law. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government is still closely monitoring the situation in Shanghai today. It is reported that the State Department is strongly advocating that Japanese troops not be allowed to enter the International Settlement. However, if Japanese troops enter the Chinese areas for the sake of protecting their residents, the US government does not object. The British government has not yet made a formal announcement regarding Secretary of State Henry Stimson's informal proposal to the British Ambassador in Washington that Britain and the United States jointly implement an economic boycott against Japan. It is now believed that Britain will not agree, and therefore the United States will not proceed alone. According to reports from London, Britain is not taking a sympathetic attitude towards the US proposal. (Guomin News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Both the State Department and the British Embassy today denied reports that the British Ambassador had visited Secretary of State Henry Stimson to discuss imposing economic pressure on Japan. The State Department does not wish to make any comments on the Shanghai situation at this time. (Guomin News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Kuomintang Representative in Europe Criticizes the League of Nations' Inability</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Mr. Zhu (transliteration), the representative of the Chinese Kuomintang in Europe, issued a statement criticizing the attitude of the League of Nations, saying that the League of Nations is weak and incompetent, and seems to be taking a laissez-faire attitude towards the current Sino-Japanese conflict. Furthermore, Japan's military actions are not only taking place in northern Manchuria, but are also expanding to central China. The League of Nations recognized this matter at the beginning of the conflict, so why did it allow it to expand in this way? The League of Nations' attitude in handling this matter is contrary to its purpose of resolving dangerous threats to world peace and maintaining respect for international treaties. China, on the one hand, must cope with its domestic political and social difficulties, and on the other hand, remains faithful to its international obligations. It now appeals to the conscience of the world and the League of Nations for assistance. Finally, the statement further stated that the League of Nations, with its current attitude, is practically allowing Japan to violate international treaties such as the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaché in Shanghai Cables the Army Ministry for Assistance</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese military attaché in Shanghai cabled the Army Ministry, requesting the dispatch of army troops to Shanghai. However, the naval authorities seem to believe that the navy can handle the current situation and does not need the assistance of the army. It is reported that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai has also expressed his concern to the government, fearing that the existing marines are insufficient to resist the Chinese army. The government is drafting a statement, scheduled to be released tomorrow, explaining the necessity of the actions taken by Japanese troops in Shanghai and guaranteeing that Japan has no ulterior motives. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Criticize the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Japanese Militarists are Arrogant and Warmongering</p>
<p>Their Self-Destruction is Imminent</p>
<p>This morning, all the London newspapers featured detailed coverage of the Shanghai news in prominent positions, treating other news as secondary. The Shanghai news and news of the American response to the Japanese actions occupied several columns. In addition, there were specially written essays and editorials. Public attention is now completely focused on Shanghai. The Daily Express stated that Japanese imperialism has clearly resolved to conquer China. It should be known that Shanghai is not the Chinese interior, which still has the power to confront Japan, although it may be somewhat slow to mobilize. The new aggression that Japan is inflicting on China may not result in victory, but rather in the suicide of Japanese militarism. The Morning Post's editorial this morning criticized the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, saying that there is a proverb that says, "Those whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad." Is this not what the Japanese militarists are doing now? The Japanese militarists are not only arrogant, but also acting blindly, disregarding everything but warmongering, and the Japanese government apparatus is actually being controlled by them. The Japanese naval and army commanders may be carrying out actions that they consider to be just in their own minds, but it is futile to try to conceal the serious consequences of the future results. The Daily Telegraph criticized the recent developments, saying that those who previously acknowledged the legitimacy of Japan's attitude towards Manchuria, now see Japan wielding its military force in Shanghai, where all countries have extremely important interests and is a highly volatile situation, cannot help but be suspicious and fearful. Japan claims that what it is doing is permissible for any country to do. This statement cannot be summarily dismissed, but can Japan control the dangerous situation and prevent it from harming other countries' rights that are as long-standing as Japan's? This is the key question. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>The Manchester Guardian published an editorial today, saying that after China had acknowledged Japan's "ultimatum" requests, the Japanese troops followed up with the actual occupation of Chinese territory. The public anger of the Chinese people has caused promoters of anti-Japanese resistance and boycotts to detain and destroy Japanese goods several times. However, in any case, such reprehensible actions are not surprising. If the spread of the boycott can be used as a legitimate excuse for Japanese troops to occupy the Chinese areas of Shanghai, then the Japanese military's invasion of most of China can also be similarly justified. The interests of Western countries on the coast of China are greater than Japan's interests in Manchuria, and are now in danger. If their commerce and investments are seriously harmed, then the actions that they are unwilling to take on matters of principle now have the potential to be taken quickly. The Guardian's intention is that future developments will depend entirely on how long Japan imagines it can rely on the extraordinary patience that Western countries have already shown. The United States will apparently welcome British cooperation in implementing a stronger policy, although this has not yet become a reality. However, if the Japanese advance further, it will certainly materialize. The Guardian concluded by saying that if Britain had been prepared to cooperate with the United States in the initial stages of the dispute, the Shanghai incident would not have occurred today.

<p>The Times of London published an editorial this morning, saying that it is difficult to say whether Japan's actions will have the effect of awakening the Nanjing government, as Japan seems to expect. But it is feared that it will only increase the chaos in the Yangtze River basin, or promote the revival of anti-foreign sentiment. In 1927, Great Britain, Japan, the United States, Italy, and France used naval and army troops to protect the concessions. Now, the fourteen countries that have connections with the concessions will increase their responsibilities due to the decisive actions of the Japanese fleet commander. The famous journalist Spender published an article in the Morning Post, saying that for the sake of safety, the League of Nations or the great powers should handle the entire issue with China and Japan. A constitution must be created for Manchuria to protect the current order and prevent Manchuria from falling into the hands of foreigners during future periods of chaos in China. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<h3>Gan Jiehou's Talk on the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Vice Foreign Minister Gan Jiehou's remarks on the Shanghai Incident are as follows: Regarding the Shanghai Incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received reports stating that after the Shanghai Municipal Government responded to the Japanese Consul, the Japanese Navy still demanded the withdrawal of our troops with the intention of occupying Shanghai, and then launched an attack on our side. Our troops, for the sake of self-defense, are now resisting with all their might. Japan demanded that the Shanghai Municipal authorities suppress anti-Japanese organizations and threatened them with force. The Beijing government authorities endured humiliation and sought peace, but after the municipal government's response, the Japanese navy still attacked us. This behavior proves: (1) That the Japanese Consul issued a demand with a deadline for a response, threatening force if the demands were not met, while the Japanese military disregarded whether there was a response or not, with the sole aim of occupying Shanghai. This shows that the Japanese military is completely不受日本政府之指挥, or (2) that the Japanese government and its military are both intentionally planning to occupy Shanghai, regardless of whether our side acknowledges their demands or not, their seizure of Shanghai is inevitable. Therefore, the Japanese side's demand that we suppress anti-Japanese organizations is merely a pretext to realize their aggression. At the beginning of the Manchurian Incident, Japan feigned that the incident stemmed from parallel lines of the South Manchurian Railway, Korean immigrants, and other minor issues. The nations were temporarily deceived by this. Subsequently, after the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution of December 10th was passed, the Japanese army continued its offensive, seizing Jinzhou. The entire Northeast region fell. Their aim was not to resolve the aforementioned minor issues, but to annex the entire Northeast. This is now glaringly obvious. At that time, the actions of the Japanese side clearly violated the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the repeated resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council. If the nations concerned intended to safeguard the dignity of the aforementioned treaties and resolutions, they should have taken appropriate measures to maintain international good faith. Now, the Japanese suddenly, on the pretext of the assault on one or two Japanese monks, unleashed their violence, attempting to occupy Shanghai, which is vital to the entire nation of China. Their aim is to destroy the political, commercial, economic, and transportation hub of China, causing China to fall into a state of disintegration, so that China has no choice but to submit and become a protectorate of Japan. Now, the Chinese troops, in order to maintain the nation's personality and honor, knowing full well that our strength is far inferior to Japan, are still willing to sacrifice everything and vow to resist to the death. Their spirit of defending the nation with no thought of personal safety is truly admirable. I deeply believe that our national troops, even to the last soldier, will fight the enemy and struggle to the end. According to the latest news, although the representatives of the League of Nations Administrative Council are very concerned about the Shanghai Incident, it is not yet known what attitude the various governments will adopt. Since the European War, all sorts of covenants aimed at ending war and ensuring peace have been valued by the world. Whether these covenants are mere child's play or truly effective can be judged by the attitudes taken by the various nations toward the Shanghai Incident. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Northeastern Chinese Traitors Discussing the Formation of a National Government</h3>
<p>(Beijing) Zhang Jinghui, representing Sun Ranjie; Xi Qia, representing He Hai; and the son of Yu Zhishan were all urged again by the Japanese to discuss the organization of a national government. The Jilin representative united various Shenyang groups and advocated that no independent country be established, nor should they become a Japanese protectorate. They proposed implementing provincial autonomy and abstaining from anti-Japanese movements. The Japanese side insisted on forming an independent country called "Jianguo" (Nation Building). The Japanese military favored an imperial system, while the diplomatic circles favored a republic. The dispute was quite fierce. The military has now relented, but they insist that Puyi be the president. Another part of the Japanese, adopting a more conciliatory approach, proposed that Zhang Jinghui be the President, Jia Shiyi be the Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhao Xinbo be the President of the Judicial Yuan, Yuan Jinkai be the President of the Supervisory Yuan, and Han Xijian be the Minister of Economic Resources and Transport. Yu Zhishan and Guan Chaozong would 分任 responsibility for the National Defense Forces.

<h3>Tianjin-Pukou Railway Workers' Strike</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The representatives of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway workers' petition group and the support association, because the railway bureau's response to their demands was unsatisfactory, gathered this morning at the station in Jinan. 1,500 workers from the machinery, engineering, and carriage departments intended to go south to petition. Workers from the Dahuai tree Railway Factory also went on strike, with over 1,500 workers arriving at the station to join them, totaling over 3,000 people. The picket team maintained order with wooden sticks. They sent a representative to request 35 cars from Section Chief Fang Bolin of the Transportation Department. Fang ordered Station Chief Wang Yuebo to allocate cars, but only a dozen or so were available. Fang then convened a meeting with the Dahuai tree Factory Director and the chiefs of the carriage, machinery, engineering, and police sections to jointly telegraph the railway bureau, stating the workers' demands: (1) Order the dismissal of Yang Yi, (2) Provide workers with housing subsidies, as exemplified by the Jiaoji Railway, (3) Repay the seventeen years of back wages in installments, and requesting instructions on how to proceed. All railway workers are now taking unified action. Over 2,000 people from Tianjin, Cangzhou, and Dezhou will take the #1 train south tonight. 600 from Tai'an, 800 from Yanzhou, 800 from Lincheng, and the workers from Xuzhou and Bengbu have all telegraphed Jinan to take unified action. The #2 train, which was detained, was released to go north at 3 PM. It is heard that it went to Dezhou to pick up the petitioning workers. Garrison Commander Lei Taiping arrived at the station, advising the workers' representatives not to block traffic and advising them not to all go to petition. The workers said that they must all go to petition, and if there are cars to sit in, they will definitely not block traffic. The #201 train, due to delays in Tianjin, arrived in Jinan at 5 PM. The workers, lacking cars, attached four cars to the #201 train. Over 100 members of the group leaders first boarded the train to go south, changing the original plan. The remaining workers dispersed to their original locations, but did not work. The train continued to be detained.
