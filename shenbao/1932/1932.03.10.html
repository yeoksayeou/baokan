<p>時評</p>
<h3>評二中全會（一）彬</h3>
<p>國民黨二中全會已於日前閉幕。際此國難日函。國脈民命不如縷之艱局。國民黨未有以誠意毅然擔承禦禍重責之表示。故此二中全會之舉行。在我一般人民視之。都以爲無足重輕。伹國民黨旣有此會議。我人自不能不予以嚴正之批判。</p>
<p>在批判之先。吾人當先認取一大前提。即中國爲我全體人民所共有。而國民黨則爲國民中極少數黨人所组織。黨人近嘗昭示國人以『黨亡國亦亡。』救國先救黨。』但我人民所認識者則正反是。蓋黨可由黨人自亡。而國則絶不容亡於黨人之手。國民尤不容坐視國危急起挽救。自前黨人固不妨先救黨而我國民則决不能不先救國。脫先黨後國。是爲輕重倒置。極其所至。勢必以國殉黨。以黨亡國。吾人不得不認淸此一點。</p>
<p>今日二中全會宣言之要點凡七（一）曰『禦侮』此與去年十二月舉行一中全會『收回失地』之决議相仿彿。收回失地。已爲不兌現之具文。而所謂</p>
<p>『禦侮。』則自去年九一八以來。政府一再鄭重宣示全國。謂已有充分之準</p>
<p>備。最大之决心。政府不負人民。不負國家。迄今半載所謂『準備』與『决心』之欺騙性。於此次上海禍變中亦已揭露無遺。今後之所謂『禦侮。』得毌必待產生軍事委員會主席而後推進乎。（二）曰『綏靖剿匪。』言之固亦成理。但匪究何由而來。是否可以『剿』而滅。過去數年。政府旣日以内亂造成災荒積極『造匪。』而又日言『剿匪。』此不僅在事實上爲矛盾。且其結果。必至『匪』以剿而愈多。民以剿匪而愈困。（三）曰『外交軍事相輔而行。』所計固亦極得。但今旣無軍事。亦無外交。如曰有之。則不過淞滬苦戰之十九路軍。出席國聯之顏惠慶代表耳。今駐外使節旣多虚懸對外宣傳。更毫無準備。外交終始處於被動地位。着着失敗。更有何外交之可言。（四）曰『擬先澈澄肅淸貪汚。』廉潔政府。固早爲我人民所渴求但致此之道。裁員减政。特其最末之一端。而其</p>
<p>最重要者。則尤於人民有監督財政之權。收支必得人民之同意。今日從政者之不廉潔。公私不明。取捨任意。官肥民瘦。私囊裕而公帑竭。已爲不能否認之事實。空談澄淸。其有奚益。（五）曰『積極設置民意機關。培養民主政治之基礎。』自國民黨主政。早已無民意可言。今猶曰民意。當不能不認爲黨政府漸有覺悟之表示。獨是所謂民意機關。究何由而設置。乎國民會議。固亦曰民意團體也。國民會議果能代表眞正民意乎。國民黨如有接納民意實現民主政治之誠意。則民意固不必求之於指派之手續。而民主政治亦不必爲矯揉之培養。際此國難日亟。明知一黨之力不能打破難局。則亟應自動取銷一黨之『狄克推多。』公開政治。予全國人民以參政之機會。予人民以充分之自由。共赴國難。政治庶有新生氣象。脫徒藉所謂國民會議等。以敷衍人民。適見其心勞日拙耳。</p>

<h3>國聯會議辯論結束</h3>
<p>將於星期四再開會議</p>
<p>顏博士佐藤相繼發言</p>
<p>各小國不承認以武力獲取任何權利</p>
<p>大會爲世界和平計應採取必要行動</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯議會中、關於中日問題之辯論繼續數日、今晚始告結束、起草委員會、現已辦理整理各種議案、而編製一總議案之工作以便提交議會、作最後之考慮、大約議會將於星期四日復開、關於編製此議案所應用之手續、曾稍起辯論、但此問題、旋即解决、捷克代表皮恩士、提議起草委員會、應以議會三月三日所推舉副議長八人組成之、所有已提交及將提交議會之各種建議、應交此起草委員八人審查、希臘代表波立狄斯等、不以此種提議爲然、議長希孟乃發保障之言、謂指導起草委員會者、不僅爲提交該會之各提案、且應爲由一般討論而發現之原則云、於是反對者遂無言、起草委員會將於明日午後四時集議、三月二日議會所推舉之副議長、爲彭古（法）摩太（瑞士）賴美爾（瑞典）西門（英）格蘭第（意）派特迦（墨）白魯寗（德）塞巴哈波（波斯）、今日大辯論後、議長請中國總代表顏博士發言、蓋以此會現漸扼要點也、</p>
<p>尋常顏代表輒在本席立起發言、但顏博士此次則離席趨至講台之前、轉向會衆而立、在會塲肅靜空氣中致詞、首謂與會者、應渠請求惠然出席、至可感謝、發言者幾無一不發擁護國聯會章之言論、國聯議會、應首先注重會章第十五條下之調停辦法、渠對此點、固亦贊同、但五個月以前、即已從事調停矣、效果如何、爲吾人所共曉、中國希望議會、竭其在會章第十五條及其他條文下之他種能力、渠以爲英代表西門所略示之宣言、將來提交議會時、不過如美國務卿史汀生一月八日所發之諜文耳、中國態度、說者不能明晰、致意見甚爲紛亂實、則中國從未請求議會採行、等於對於中日爭點加以武斷之行爲也、但國聯會章被破壞矣、中國二十萬方哩之土地、被外人破壞會章第十條而强佔之矣、日本且不允提交公斷、致與會章抵觸矣、此皆顯明事實也、今國聯必須告向日本曰『撤回日軍、容吾人以吾人所承認之方法、助爾解决對華爭點、』查國聯成立李頓調查團之議案、明白規定日本關於撤軍之擔任、不因調查團之組織、而受影響、今日本不撤兵、反促成滿洲獨立之運動、實則日軍撤退時、則此運動即傾覆矣云、顏博士最後、向各發言人道謝、以其表示對於當前難題之高尚意見也、並曰發言者、僉謂國聯將擁護會章、余代表中國、謹向議會重伸此請云、</p>
<p>顏博士發言旣畢、議長請日代表佐藤發言、佐藤亦從演壇致詞、略述日本案情、謂日代表松平之議論、及日代表送交國聯之文件業已明白表示日本之態度日本之所以有軍事行動者、因其國人受危</p>

<h3>接國内外要電</h3>
<p>害也、舍此無他道、日本旣不欲用武力解决對華爭端、亦無破壞中國政治與土地獨立之意、日人今所爲者、他國已先爲之、且將繼續爲之、中國非任何他國可比、與歐美任何國不同、試問世界有任何國以排外情感爲其外交政策之根據者乎、佐藤又謂日本不欲施用軍事壓力、渠願見上海時局、由各國會同依照事實而解决之、日本自始即擁護國聯、並履行會章之規定、日本願見會章完全與整個之實施、但以編製會章者之精神實施之、日政府完全感謝國聯行政會之努力、並感謝美國及在滬會同他國冀復和平之美代表云、</p>
<p>午後開會、各代表討論時、中美薩爾伐都國代表巴里台斯發言、其意與南愛爾蘭代表萊斯特之言相同、渠言及十二月十日國聯行政會、請日軍撤回南滿鐡路區域之議案、謂國聯必須一再承認國聯會章之基本原則、因該原則禁止侵犯、無論其爲索取債欵、或爲恢復他種權利起見也云、匈牙利代表、阿本伊發言逆料一九三二年、爲國聯歷史中最緊要年代、謂從目前爭端中、宜獲有若干切實結果、此爲最重要事、今戰事停止與否、尙未確定、故第一當使停戰、議會必須注其全力於此、餘者可依照英代表西門所建議之方針製定議案云、</p>
<p>英代表西門、於商諸出席軍縮大會之美代表後、宣讀上海發來之官塲報告、該報告述日軍三月六日所佔據之界線、謂日軍佔據從瀏河西北起、經過婁塘（嘉定西一哩）至南翔以西、而達蘇州河之陣線若干點、三月七日曾發生兵士佔據新陣地</p>
<h3>我國總代表顏惠慶近影</h3>
<p>時所常有之小接觸、該報告又言及日本生力軍在吳淞登陸事、並聲明實地情報、僅可從日方得之、因華軍退却、難得其詳也云、</p>
<p>西門宣讀軍事情形報告後、議會復作討論、海第國代表馬雅德·與布國代表巴台洛夫、皆主張維持國聯會章與非戰公約之尊嚴、布代表且允許對於保障會章等尊嚴之任何行動、予以援助、巨哥斯拉夫國代表那蘇蘭尼克、謂議會似將因作根據會章第十五條之重大决議而成立一種前例依、渠意見、此種議决議在其實施上、甚應普遍、議會必須用其權力中所有之各種方法、以解决此難題、而避免可使此問題眞正原因反而隱蔽之任何計劃云、南斐代表華特發言、謂日本挾未曾披露之理由、不獨未以和平方法、謀取其困難之解决、且顯然不顧其在非戰公約下之義務、中國迄今未能平息其内部之異見、固屬可悲、但中國之弱、不能爲强國乘機利用之理由、渠對於日人之德性智力勇氣與愛國心、甚爲欽慕、爲此理由、故渠請日人改其戰爭計劃而和平方法、俾了結此危險爭點、世人現企望大國之强有力引導、而此引導可以行而非空言見之已、試問各大國已以有此引導爲滿意乎云、次印度代表阿迦可汗稱、從歷史上着想、印度中國以及日本在文化上宗敎上均有長久及密切之關係是、故中日切勿相殘、應謀互相和好、及智識之合作、國聯大會宜持以鎭靜之態度、努力調解云、</p>
<p>阿迦可汗對於西門之提案、表示贊同、並請中日兩國無條件聽候國聯解决云、玻璃維亞代表羅斯稱凡</p>
<h3>以武力獲取者各小國不能加以承認</h3>
<p>故各小國認會章之原則、係其前途之保障、至於解决方案、會章已備之矣、大會應明白表示國聯爲謀世界和平計、有採取必要行動之權力云、（八日路透社電）（日内瓦）㈠顏代表最近在大會演說、博得全塲長時間之鼓掌、㈡三十三國代表嚴斥日本之侵略行爲、㈢全世界反日之精神動員已於今日完成、㈣但日本精神上之失敗、必將激起軍事上之總攻、㈤故我方最後軍事上之抵抗、急不容緩、（三月九日專電）</p>

<p>倫敦今晨紀事報載稱、遠東陰霾之中、已露一線光明、即英美今已提携工作、及美國已切實與聯國合作是、此二事無論如何、皆屬重要、將來或易予兩國以目下不可測度之重要云、上海局勢漸有轉佳氣象、故兵險保費已爲减低、由日船自貨棧運至上海貨棧之貨、水險至小之保費、每鎊已减十先令、由他國之船載運者、除中國船外、前爲十先令、今爲五先令、此外經過上海運往日本朝鮮及東三省之貨物、其兵險保費亦均减半、（九日路透社電）</p>

        <h1>1932.03.10</h1>
<h3>Assessment of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee (1) Bin</h3>
<p>The Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee concluded a few days ago. At this time of national crisis, with the nation’s fate and the people's lives hanging by a thread, the Kuomintang has not shown any sincere or resolute commitment to shouldering the heavy responsibility of defending against disaster. Therefore, the convening of this Second Plenary Session is regarded by the general public as insignificant. However, since the Kuomintang has held this meeting, we cannot but offer a serious critique.</p>
<p>Before critiquing, we must first acknowledge a major premise: that China belongs to all of its people, while the Kuomintang is an organization of a very small number of party members. Party members recently proclaimed to the nation that "If the Party dies, the nation dies too" and that "Saving the nation means saving the Party first." But what our people recognize is precisely the opposite. The Party may be destroyed by its own members, but the nation must never be allowed to perish at the hands of party members. The people, even more so, cannot stand idly by as the nation faces a crisis without taking action to save it. In the past, party members were certainly free to save the Party first, but our people absolutely cannot but save the nation first. Abandoning the nation for the Party is a reversal of priorities. If things go to the extreme, it will inevitably lead to sacrificing the nation for the Party, and the Party destroying the nation. We must recognize this clearly.</p>
<p>Today, the main points of the Second Plenary Session's declaration are sevenfold: (1) "Resisting Insults." This is similar to the resolution of the First Plenary Session held last December to "Recover Lost Territories." Recovering lost territories has already become a meaningless formality. As for the so-called "Resisting Insults," since September 18th of last year, the government has repeatedly and solemnly declared to the whole country that it has made full preparations and has the greatest determination. The government will not let down the people or the nation. Half a year has passed, and the deceptive nature of the so-called "preparations" and "determination" has been completely exposed in this Shanghai disaster. Will the so-called "Resisting Insults" have to wait for the establishment of a chairman of the Military Affairs Commission before it can be promoted? (2) "Pacifying and Suppressing Bandits." This is ostensibly reasonable. But how do bandits arise? Can they be eradicated by "suppression?" In the past few years, the government has actively "created bandits" by causing disaster and famine through internal strife, while simultaneously talking about "suppressing bandits." This is not only factually contradictory, but its result will inevitably be that "bandits" increase with suppression, and the people become more impoverished by bandit suppression. (3) "Diplomacy and Military Affairs Go Hand in Hand." This plan is indeed excellent. But today, there is neither military strength nor diplomacy. If there were any, it would only be the 19th Route Army in the bitter battle of Shanghai and the representative Yan Huiqing at the League of Nations. Today, the foreign envoys are mostly vacant positions and there is no preparation for external propaganda. Diplomacy is always in a passive position, failing at every turn. What diplomacy can be spoken of? (4) "Planning to Thoroughly Investigate and Eliminate Corruption." A clean government has long been desired by our people, but reducing staff and streamlining administration is only the last step. The most important thing is that the people have the right to supervise finances. Revenue and expenditure must have the consent of the people. Today, the lack of integrity among those in power, the blurring of public and private affairs, arbitrary decisions, officials getting rich while the people become poor, and private pockets overflowing while public funds are exhausted are undeniable facts. Empty talk of purification is of no benefit. (5) "Actively Establishing Popular Opinion Organs and Cultivating the Foundation of Democratic Politics." Since the Kuomintang came to power, there has been no popular opinion to speak of. Now, still mentioning popular opinion must be regarded as an indication that the Party government is gradually awakening. But how are these so-called popular opinion organs to be established? The National Assembly is also called a popular opinion body. Can the National Assembly truly represent the will of the people? If the Kuomintang has the sincerity to accept popular opinion and realize democratic politics, then popular opinion does not need to be sought through appointed procedures, and democratic politics does not need to be artificially cultivated. At this time of urgent national crisis, knowing that the power of one party cannot break the deadlock, it should immediately and voluntarily abolish the "dictatorship" of one party, make politics open, give the people of the whole country the opportunity to participate in politics, give the people full freedom, and jointly face the national crisis. Politics will then have a new atmosphere. Merely using the so-called National Assembly, etc., to perfunctorily deal with the people will only show that their efforts are increasingly clumsy.</p>
<p>Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Continue to Advance Westward Amid Ceasefire Calls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese troops attacked and landed at Ludu Bridge and Liuhe. Japanese troops are plotting. Commander-in-Chief Jiang cabled for disclosure.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Jiang's Cable</h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army Office in Shanghai received the following cable from Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai at the front on the 9th: To Director Fan of the 19th Route Army Office and forwarded to Mayor Wu and the Foreign Ministry Office: Yesterday (8th) afternoon, hundreds of enemy cavalry attacked Ludu Bridge east of Taicang and were repelled by our troops. This morning (9th), more than 2,000 enemy troops attacked Ludu Bridge, attempting to invade our Taicang. According to confirmed reports, thousands of enemy troops landed in Liuhe yesterday (8th) and are moving westward. The enemy is advancing troops on one hand and declaring a ceasefire to the outside world on the other, deceiving the League of Nations. Their cunning and baseness are extremely hateful. It is hoped that their conspiracy will be quickly exposed and not be deceived by them. Jiang Guangnai, printed on the morning of the 9th.</p>
<p>Compilation of Frontline War News</p>
<h3>Enemy at Ludu Bridge Repelled</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Suzhou, 8th:</p>
<p>A telegram states that near Ludu Bridge, east of Taicang, more than 200 enemy cavalry were discovered on the morning of the 8th, launching a fierce attack on us. After our courageous resistance and several hours of fierce fighting, the enemy was repelled, and six enemy horses and more than ten guns were captured. There were many enemy plainclothes troops who repeatedly attacked our positions but were all repelled.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attack on Taicang Fails</h3>
<p>Telegram from Nanjing, 9th:</p>
<p>It is said that the 19th Route Army Office in Nanjing received a telegram from Kunshan on the 9th, stating that this morning (9th), more than 200 Japanese cavalry reconnaissance troops were in the Taicang area to survey the terrain. We discovered them, captured one soldier, more than ten warhorses, and seized more than twenty rifles. The remaining enemies collapsed. According to a military officer who came to Nanjing from Kunshan on the 9th, since our troops retreated to the second line of defense, there have been no fierce battles with the enemy, only minor skirmishes at the front. It has been even quieter in the past two days.</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that yesterday afternoon, the official received a telegram from the front stating that at noon on the 8th, hundreds of Japanese cavalry launched a fierce attack from Xintang City towards Taicang. Our troops fought back bravely and repelled the Japanese troops, who retreated towards Xintang.</p>
<h3>Huangdu Has Not Fallen</h3>
<p>Correspondent of the Far East News Agency</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met with a communication officer from a certain brigade headquarters who had just arrived in Shanghai from the front and inquired about the situation at the front in detail. I received the following answers, which are sufficient to inform the public who are concerned about current affairs. The officer first said that there are many rumors in Kunshan, Suzhou, and Shanghai. Since our troops retreated to the second line of defense, they are somewhat isolated from Shanghai, and news of the war has been quiet. People suspect that our military operations have failed. There are even rumors that Huangdu, Kunshan, and Taicang have all fallen, and there are many speculative and pessimistic reports. In fact, Huangdu has not fallen, and Kunshan and Taicang are even safer. Although the enemy has launched repeated fierce attacks on our Huangdu in recent days, their intention is nothing more than to take advantage of our army's retreat and the incomplete defense works to pursue us closely, hoping to break through our army's line. In fact, the defense works in all parts of our second line of defense have been carefully arranged in advance. This is a preparation that every military strategist should have. Therefore, when we retreated to the second line of defense, we immediately prepared for battle and waited for the enemy. Therefore, the enemy's repeated attacks have been unsuccessful. Huangdu is still in our army's hands. The officer also described the situation when Brigadier-General Weng's brigade retreated, saying that when the order to retreat was issued on the first, although the soldiers were willing to defend the fort to the death, due to strategic considerations, preparations had already been made for the retreat. On the morning of the second, the main force moved towards Liuhe, and part of it moved towards Jiading, with the covering troops going first. Brigadier-General Weng and about 700 members of the guard and volunteer teams followed. The danger was indeed extremely great. The covering troops had not gone far when they heard gunfire. Judging by its nature, they knew that the enemy at the front had come into contact with our army, so they rushed forward, and the enemy finally collapsed. Brigadier-General Weng arrived safely in Jiading on the second. There have been many rumors outside that Brigadier-General Weng's entire army was annihilated, which is ridiculous. The officer said that in order to confirm that Brigadier-General Weng's brigade was indeed safe and well, he and a reporter from the Wuxi National Herald went to Brigadier-General Weng's location. Brigadier-General Weng kept the reporter for lunch and took photos, which can prove it. He also said that in more than a month of fighting, Brigadier-General Weng's brigade suffered less than 300 casualties in total. On a daily basis, the casualties were only a few people. Now Jiading is an empty city because neither the enemy nor our army is occupying it. Jiading has been gained and lost two or three times, and now it has become a place where the two armies are facing each other. Taicang is very safe. Finally, he said that our army has the possibility of retaking Nanxiang and Zhenru at this moment, but because the purpose of the war at this moment is to eliminate the enemy's main force, not to focus on winning a city or a place. The enemy is still constantly attacking every day, and at the same time, they are concentrating in a certain direction, and will launch a general attack on a large scale during the day. Our side also knows the enemy's intentions and is on serious alert. When the enemy comes to attack, we will hit them hard. After defeating their main force, it will not be difficult to recover Shanghai and Songhu.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Reconnoiter Suzhou</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Suzhou, 8th:</p>
<p>Japanese planes circled over Suzhou on the morning of the 8th to spy on the area. County Magistrate Wu Deyao of Kunshan took the seal and fled to Jiaozhi in Suzhou on the 5th. He drowned himself in the Gaohe Bridge on the 8th. Wu was a native of Anhui and was 60 years old. The body has been recovered.</p>
<h3>Traitors at Fuqiao Assist Abuse</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Changshu, 8th:</p>
<p>Ma Yuren's team acts as Japanese spies in Fuqiao, setting fires as signals and directing Japanese troops to land. The Japanese troops in Xintang City are not Japanese, but people from Jiangbei dressed in enemy uniforms. There is a shortage of food in Fuqiao, and the enemy has no way to purchase it, so they burned civilian houses. The Japanese headquarters is located in the Ziheshu Pancake Shop in Liuhe and moved the soybean cakes to build trenches.</p>
<h3>Luo Brigade Wishes to Go to the Front Line</h3>
<p>Luo Qiqiang's circular telegram states: (Titles omitted) All are informed that I recently sent a telegram to the central government, which reads: "Having received repeated telegrams from the staff office of the E-Sui Pacification Headquarters informing us that the violent Japanese are repeatedly increasing their troops and their ambition is undisguised. It is difficult to rely on justice, and the destruction of the country is imminent. At this critical moment, we can only uphold the righteousness of national survival and destruction, embrace the determination to die, and fight them in the yellow sand and blood. I, Qiqiang, humbly lead the division and belong to the military, and my responsibility is to serve to the death. I hereby lead my troops and wish to aid Shanghai. If equal importance is attached to suppressing the communists and resisting Japan, then the communist bandits will have been eliminated in the three months that my division has been stationed here, and the local militia can defend themselves. If my division's weapons are not sophisticated enough to defeat the strong enemy, then all my officers and soldiers are willing to sacrifice the name of the independent brigade and serve as a supplement to our 19th Route Army. I would rather be a ghost who died in battle than a slave of a fallen country. I sincerely hope that you will appreciate my foolish sincerity and order me to the front line. If I can die in the right place, what could be more joyful? I am sending this special telegram to volunteer, and I am awaiting it with the utmost anticipation." I am sending this special telegram to inform you and respectfully urge you to make it happen so that all officers and soldiers can pursue this ambition. I am waiting with the utmost anticipation. Luo Qiqiang, Brigade Commander of the Independent Brigade of the Army, together with all officers and soldiers. Respectfully, Yu, printed.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Li Zongren for Aid</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Independent Division No. 0 of the Fourth Group Army of the National Revolutionary Army telegraphed Commander Li Zongren yesterday, saying: "The country is in urgent need. Exploring and sending □□ to Commander Li Zongren's command. Since the Japanese invaders invaded Shanghai on January 28, our 19th Route Army has fought for self-defense and resistance, spilling blood for more than a month, greatly thwarting the enemy's arrogance and repeatedly annihilating the enemy's forces. However, the enemy is constantly increasing its reinforcements, even mobilizing a force of 100,000 to launch a large-scale invasion. The central government has a complete plan for resisting Japan and has repeatedly ordered the people, but the dispatch of reinforcements is sluggish, and the Shanghai-Songhu defense line is expanding day by day. Our 19th Route Army has to move the trenches to resist the enemy, seeking long-term resistance. Unfortunately, Shanghai, the economic center, cultural center, and political center of the country, has finally fallen into ruins. We cannot help but lament. Now, the Japanese invaders are openly defying the resolutions of the League of Nations' sacred prestige, tearing up conventions and laws, and resorting to bombing policies. They are making reckless advances and are filled with anger. Your command is weighing the increasingly urgent national crisis and the increasingly deep invasion of the enemy. Please quickly rescue the people who are under the iron heel of the Japanese in Shanghai, act expediently, and immediately order the troops of the Independent Division No. 0 to rush to aid Shanghai day and night. Your command is decisive and will inflict a painful blow on the fierce enemy. In the telegram, I cannot express the extreme anticipation. The Shanghai Office of the Independent Division No. 0 of the Fourth Group Army of the National Revolutionary Army, printed.</p>
<h3>Shirakawa's Unilateral Statement</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said: "Military news: Several armies are now concentrated in Liuhe and Jiading, planning to attack Taicang. At the same time, they are also planning to attack Kunshan. The current Japanese commander, Shirakawa Yoshinori, has issued a statement in the style of an ultimatum, dividing six locations - Binjiang, Fuqiao, Yuewang City, Anting, Baihe Port - as boundaries, and prohibiting Chinese troops from being stationed there. Otherwise, they will attack us. (The reporter noted that the six locations mentioned by Shirakawa are entirely our army's defense areas.) Moreover, Binjiang, Fuqiao, and Yuewang City are located northwest of Liuhe, about ten miles apart. Shirakawa's statement is tantamount to forcing our army to withdraw. The original text of his statement is translated as follows: 'In order to seek a peaceful resolution, a statement was issued on the third. Since the issuance of this statement, the offensive has been stopped. However, the Chinese army has deployed positions near Meili and Kunshan and concentrated troops near Taicang. Part of it has already spied on my (Japanese army) security line. I deeply regret it. If the Chinese army invades the following locations in the future, that is, east of Binjiang, Fuqiao Town, Yuewang City, Waigang Town, Anting Town, Baihe Port Town, with the Suzhou River as the boundary, or if there is a conflict with my (Japanese army) sentries, and the situation deteriorates again and causes disputes, the responsibility lies with the Chinese army.'"</p>
<p>Leaving Japan to Come to Shanghai</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>Imperial Banquet Held for Them During Their Stay in Japan</p>
<p>The League of Nations Liaoning Incident Investigation Team, led by British Chairman Lord Lytton, along with various members and secretaries, has been busy contacting various parties since arriving in Japan on the 29th of last month. It was not until today that they left Tokyo for Kobe and transferred to the Adams President, a mail ship of the Great Lai Yang Company, to come to Shanghai. It has been confirmed that the ship is scheduled to leave Kobe tomorrow and head straight for Shanghai. Yesterday, it was confirmed that it is scheduled to arrive at Wusong at 8:00 a.m. on the 14th. The Great Lai Yang Company has specially dispatched a small steamer to greet them outside Wusong. They will land at the New Customs Wharf at about 9:30 a.m. The itinerary of the delegation after arriving in Shanghai will be to go to Nanjing first and then to Liaoning. The list of members is recorded below. British investigation team leader Sir Lytton Rt, Hanthe Earlop Lytton, American representative Mr. McCay Major General Frank R, McCay, Italian investigation team member Count Luigi Aldrovandi Marescotti, German investigation team member Dr. Hanrich H. Schnesr Lieois, secretaries assigned by the League of Nations Vladimir Pastubkv, Adrien Pelt, and Mr. Hons Van Kotze.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Nagasaki Daily News, the Emperor held a luncheon at the Fengming Hall in the palace on the afternoon of the 3rd, inviting the members of the International Investigation Team, including Mr. Lytton. Guided by Yoshida, the Ambassador to Turkey, they went to the Imperial Hotel to welcome them into the palace. They first met with Prince Chichibu and Prince Asaka and their consorts, and then, guided by Chief Lin, Grand Chamberlain Suzuki, and Chamberlain Kawai, they met with the Emperor and Empress. The Empress replied through the interpreter, Lady Takagi. They then entered the Fengming Hall for lunch, while palace music was played. At the same time, Prince Chichibu and Prince Asaka and their consorts entered the hall. Foreign Minister Yoshizawa and his wife, Turkish Ambassador Yoshida, Privy Councilor Makino, Palace Minister Ichiki, Grand Chamberlain Suzuki, Chief Lin, Chamberlains Kawai, and other ladies and gentlemen who served were also present. They talked happily until 3:00 p.m. before the gathering dispersed.</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency said that, according to reliable sources, Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa telegraphed Matsudaoka Yosuke, who was sent to Shanghai, yesterday, ordering him to stay in Shanghai to handle diplomatic affairs and deal with the International Investigation Team that will be coming to Shanghai from Japan, and not to return home in a hurry.</p>
<h3>Astonishing Losses in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Estimated to Be Around 400 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai and Songhu, the areas along the Wusong River and Jiangwan have been bombarded by Japanese artillery fire. The amount of losses is still under investigation. The losses to the people's property in the corner of Zhabei alone are already alarming. According to the results of the investigation conducted by local accountants together with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Social Affairs Bureau, the actual loss of property has reached more than 200 million yuan. However, various businesses established by merchants near Zhabei have not yet reported to the association, so they are not included. If a comprehensive statistic is made, it will be doubled, and the loss will be around 400 million yuan.</p>
<h3>More Signs of Peace</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Delivered New Note Last Night</p>
<p>Ceasefire Conference to Be Held Soon</p>
<p>British and American Envoys Hosted Banquets for Our Officials Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai ceasefire issue, the Japanese side strongly advocates holding a round-table conference, while our side insists on not participating in the conference before the Japanese troops withdraw, so as not to become a treaty under the city. According to diplomatic sources, the Japanese side has delivered a new note to our side last night, so the Shanghai ceasefire conference is in progress again. It is expected to be held soon. However, the scope of the discussion at the ceasefire conference will still be based on the principle of Japan's unconditional withdrawal of troops, without involving other political issues, which is completely different in nature from the round-table conference reported by the Japanese side. Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi telegraphed Premier Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan in Luoyang and Foreign Minister Luo Wengan in Nanjing last night for instructions. According to sources from the British and American sides, Japan invited representatives from relevant countries to participate in the conference. British Minister Lampson and American Minister Johnson expressed their unwillingness, so the British and American sides decided that no one would participate. French Minister Wilden also reportedly expressed the same opinion. As for the withdrawal of troops, the Japanese side reportedly still takes the suppression of the anti-Japanese movement as the main condition. Our side has stated that the ceasefire conference is limited to discussing the unconditional withdrawal of Japanese troops, so there is no room for discussion on the suppression of the anti-Japanese movement. British Minister Lampson invited American Minister Johnson, French Minister Wilden, and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano to exchange views at the British Consulate General's residence yesterday morning. Yesterday afternoon, British Minister Lampson and British Consul General Big John hosted a banquet for our officials, including Finance Minister Song Ziwen, Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, Foreign Affairs Committee Gu Weijun, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Wen Yingxing, and Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Guo Dehua.</p>
<p>According to the Zi Lin News, yesterday morning (8th), Commander-in-Chief Shirakawa visited the commanders of the British, American, French, and Italian troops stationed in Shanghai. In the afternoon, he conferred with Japanese Minister Shigemitsu and Japanese Consul General Murai on the Shanghai situation. It is expected that his visit to the commanders of various countries is also related to the Shanghai situation.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Troops Relieving Others</h3>
<p>The 14th Division Arrives</p>
<p>According to the Great American Evening Post, the Japanese Army's 14th Division has relieved the 9th Division in taking over the defense of the front line. The 9th Division will return to Shanghai soon and rest at the headquarters on Pingliang Road. The 14th Division landed at Zhanghuabang on the 7th of this month and consists of about 20,000 soldiers, including the 27th and 28th Brigades, organized into the 2nd, 59th, 15th, and 30th Infantry Regiments. Yesterday (8th) afternoon, foreigners who visited the Jiangwan war zone saw the soldiers of the 14th Division filling the road, heading towards Dachang. The队伍 (duiwu) was several miles long, and the road was very narrow, so the progress was very slow. Many soldiers were exhausted from marching and collapsed by the side of the road, and members of the accompanying medical team went to treat them. Several people were no longer able to walk and were placed on the baggage carts. A young military officer also collapsed by the side of the road because he could not endure the long march. The entire team stopped for several minutes. Although the officer was treated by the doctor, he was unable to recover his spirit and was carried onto the soldiers' stove cart, which was pulled by six strong soldiers. Several straggling soldiers did not know where to find several rickshaws and filled them with their military supplies so that they could walk lightly. There was also a soldier who hired a coolie to carry his luggage. The bodies of the Japanese soldiers in the Jiangwan trenches have been removed. The Japanese army is now filling the trenches, and the bodies of the Chinese are buried in the trenches. Moreover, souvenirs of the battlefield have been almost completely searched for by the Japanese. Very few foreigners are allowed to go to the war zone.</p>
<p>More Than Ten Ships Sailed Away</p>
<p>Yesterday, More Than Ten Japanese Warships Left Shanghai for Japan</p>
<p>Yesterday, a merchant ship arrived in Shanghai, and its crew members witnessed a large fleet of Japanese warships sailing out of Shanghai and returning to Japan. As for the Japanese warships remaining in Shanghai, there are only four gunboats and eight torpedo boats left in the Huangpu River, in addition to ten transport ships.</p>
<p>Ambo Arrives in Shanghai for Inspection</p>
<p>Former Japanese Naval Minister Admiral Ambo, accompanied by Major General Kawa, Colonel Sawamoto, and Major Kajie, arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the Shanghai Maru. He will go to the front line to inspect the troops and plans to visit the naval and army commanders of various countries stationed in Shanghai. In addition, the Japanese military hospital ship Shinano Maru, which was sent to Shanghai, has departed from Kobe and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>19th Route Army</p>
<h3>Has Not Dispatched Personnel to Solicit Donations</h3>
<p>The 19th Route Army's defense of the territory and resistance to Japan has inspired compatriots at home and abroad, who have enthusiastically and voluntarily supported the army's funds.</p>
<p>However, the army believes that defending the territory and resisting aggression is its duty. It expresses its deep gratitude to the public for their voluntary donations, but has never directly dispatched military officers or other personnel to solicit donations from shops, households, or organizations. All our merchants and people should pay attention and not be deceived by unscrupulous people posing as representatives of the army to solicit donations.</p>
<p>Dutch Government</p>
<h3>Restricts Remittances From Chinese and Japanese Nationals</h3>
<p>No Assistance for Military Purposes Allowed</p>
<p>Remittances for Relief Can Be Sent to the Red Cross</p>
<p>Mayao (translated phonetic name of Dutch official), the Prefect of Batavia in the Dutch East Indies, invited editors of various Chinese newspapers to discuss the matter. Reporters from the Wenchow Daily, Wenchow Commercial Daily, and Chinese Tiansheng Daily attended. The Prefect said that since there is a war between China and Japan, the Dutch government is strictly neutral and cannot provide any military assistance to either side. In the past, a Japanese woman remitted money to the Japanese army in Manchuria, and the matter was not pursued. But in the future, this will not be allowed to happen again. As for your nationals remitting money to Shanghai for the relief of wounded soldiers, civilians, and refugees, they can send it to the Chinese Red Cross, which has full authority to handle it. But it must not be handed over through military or government agencies, so as to avoid it being diverted for military expenses. It is hoped that reporters will state in the newspapers that this money is by no means for the purchase of military supplies.</p>
<p>Law Society</p>
<h3>Regarding the Doubts Surrounding Wang Geng's Arrest</h3>
<p>Letter Questioning Lawyers Xu Wenhao and Wang Xiaowen</p>
<p>Ever since Wang Geng, the independent brigade commander of the 88th Division, was arrested by Japanese soldiers, his family immediately retained lawyers Xu Wenhao and Wang Xiaowen, requesting the Law Society to file a protest according to the law. The society then submitted it to the 100th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees for discussion. However, Wang had already been safely released, and everyone agreed that there were many doubts surrounding the matter. Therefore, yesterday, a letter was specifically sent to lawyers Xu and Wang, questioning the process of Wang Geng's arrest and release. The original letter stated: "To reply directly, we previously received your member's letter dated March 1, stating that you were entrusted by the family of Wang Geng, the independent brigade commander of the 88th Division of the Army, to file a serious protest according to the law regarding the incident where violent Japanese plainclothes soldiers stopped and searched Wang Geng on the road and pursued and arrested him, and the Public Concession police assisted in sending him to the Hongkou Police Station. After inquiring about the reasons, they still handed Wang Geng over to the Japanese naval soldiers to take away, and his life or death is unknown. This matter was submitted to the 100th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees on the 5th of this month, discussed in detail, and we also read in the newspaper that Brigade Commander Wang Geng has now been released by the enemy and has regained his freedom. According to general public opinion, there are many questions regarding Brigade Commander Wang Geng's pursuit and arrest by the enemy on February 17. Let us list them: ㈠ Wang Geng has lived in Shanghai for a long time and is a graduate student from the United States. The people of Shanghai know his life history in detail. Saying that he did not know that the US Consulate General had moved and went to Huangpu Road to inquire is a blatant lie. ㈡ As an active-duty military officer and a military commander fighting the Japanese in the local area, he should be aware of the enemy's defense zone. Even if he did not know that the US Consulate General had moved and went to the old site of the US Consulate, he had to pass through the enemy's defense zone. He cannot claim ignorance. Wang Geng was not a diplomat. We ask, for what reason, with what necessity, or on whose mission did he have to risk crossing the enemy's defense zone to visit the US Consul General? ㈢ News reports stated that Wang Geng was carrying a leather bag with important documents containing military secrets when he was arrested. After the enemy obtained these documents, they suddenly changed their strategy, avoiding strength and attacking weakness, forming an encirclement of our army, forcing our army to retreat completely. If this is true, then for what reason did Wang Geng carry these important documents containing secrets to visit the US Consul General? He would have no excuse to offer. ㈣ If Wang Geng had indeed mistakenly entered the enemy's defense zone and was arrested, then as an active-duty officer of ours and a prisoner of the enemy, there is no reason why he would be easily released. Why was he released within a few days? Based on the clues mentioned above, if Wang Geng cannot provide a satisfactory answer, then he is suspected of deliberately aiding the enemy and cannot escape suspicion. Although our association is committed to protecting human rights, with the country in crisis, we should do everything we can to condemn and punish treacherous traitors who have lost their conscience and sanity and bring them to justice. It was decided that a letter of inquiry should be sent first. Therefore, we request that your members investigate and then forward it to Wang Geng or his family. After detailed questioning, please forward the truthful reply to the association for review. To lawyers Xu Wenhao and Wang Xiaowen."</p>
<h3>Notice to Fellow Jiangbei Natives</h3>
<p>Do Not Be Used by the Japanese</p>
<p>Intellectuals in the Xiaoshadu area of ​​western Shanghai, recognizing that the general Jiangbei compatriots lack knowledge during the Japanese army's invasion of Shanghai, and are often used by violent Japanese and suffer death, which is extremely pitiful, initiated the printing of a notice to persuade Jiangbei compatriots not to be used by the Japanese. It has been widely posted on the streets, roughly stating: "Dear and pitiable Jiangbei compatriots, we have long known about your situation, but unfortunately we cannot help you. We are very sorry. At present, please endure for the time being. There will always be a way in the future. You must know that this Shanghai incident concerns the entire survival of China and Japan. Do not treat it as a local matter. The past is gone, the future can be pursued. In the future, please do not help the Japanese to do things like killing, arson, and shameless acts of serving as accomplices for the wicked. You must know that the Japanese are using you at this moment, but in the blink of an eye, when things have passed, they will discard you like a bird is killed when the bow is no longer needed, or a dog is cooked after the hare is caught. Who knows if the evil deeds they instigated you to do will not be inflicted on you? Wake up, wake up!" (Below omitted) Jiangbei Compatriots Pleadingly Report to the Municipal Government</p>
<h3>Actively Relieving Unemployed Workers</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, areas such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong, which are known for their many factories, have become war zones. Factories in the Public Concession, French Concession, Nanshi, and Pudong have also mostly ceased operation due to the impact of the war. According to investigations, more than 250,000 machinery workers are unemployed, and more than 17,000 handicraft workers are unemployed. Other small family-style factories, as well as company, store, and shop employees, are not included because they cannot be investigated at this time. If relief measures are not taken, it will greatly affect local security. The Municipal Government, in light of this, has repeatedly discussed relief measures, but no good plan has been found. However, after our army retreated to the second line of defense, Chinese and foreign factories in western and eastern Shanghai resumed operation one after another, so many people went to work in the factories. Currently, the number of unemployed people is still more than 100,000 in the machinery industry and more than 10,000 in the handicraft industry. The Social Affairs Bureau, upon orders, dispatched personnel yesterday to the Chinese Cotton Mill Association and leaders of various industries to discuss the issue of relieving unemployed workers. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited the Chinese Cotton Mill Association yesterday and was told that the Chinese cotton mills will do their best to settle the unemployed workers of the Japanese cotton mills.</p>
<h3>Murai Apologizes to the US Consul</h3>
<p>Regarding the Incident of Japanese Soldiers Assaulting an American Woman</p>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reported that the other day, Japanese soldiers unreasonably assaulted an American woman (a teacher at Shunde Girls' School). Yesterday, Japanese Consul General Murai specifically apologized to the US Consul. This matter can be considered closed.</p>
<h3>New Brazilian Consul in Shanghai Takes Office</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce received a letter from Brazilian Consul Mita stationed in Shanghai, stating: "To whom it may concern, I have received your esteemed association's declaration and am deeply grateful. Upon investigation, Brazil is not a member of the League of Nations nor a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. I fully understand the contents of the declaration. I have now notified my government. At the same time, I have taken office as consul. I hope you will take note of this."</p>
<p>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</p>
<h3>Three Trains Each Way Today</h3>
<p>Fourth-Class Slow Train Resumes</p>
<p>Due to the fact that more than 100,000 people took the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway to escape to Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Shangyu, Jiaxing, Huzhou and other places, now that Shanghai has ceased hostilities, many merchants and residents who took refuge are returning to Shanghai. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, a total of more than 7,000 male and female passengers arrived in Shanghai, with more than 3,000 pieces of luggage. The No. 35 early train from Hangzhou to Shanghai, which departed at 3:26 PM yesterday, had more than 2,000 passengers and more than 1,000 pieces of luggage. The second train to arrive in Shanghai also had 1,500 to 1,600 passengers and more than 800 pieces of luggage. Loading luggage and passengers onto the train resulted in delays of at least two hours en route. The No. 36 early train from Shanghai to Hangzhou departed at 8:25 AM with more than 500 passengers. The No. 38 express train to Hangzhou at 5:00 PM had only more than 300 passengers. The Railway Bureau's Traffic Department, in view of the congestion of passengers from Hangzhou, added the No. 39 and No. 40 fourth-class slow trains to and from Shanghai today (the 10th) for the convenience of travelers. The No. 40 slow train departs from Shanghai at 9:45 AM and arrives in Hangzhou at 4:35 PM. The No. 40 slow train departs from Hangzhou at 10:00 AM and arrives in Shanghai at 5:20 PM.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Association North Factory Unharmed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Association has three funeral parlors, one of which is located south of Baziqiao on Yokohama Road, called the North Factory. Due to the recent war, the factory was within the Japanese military line and isolated from the public, making it impossible to inquire about its condition for more than a month. Although the association repeatedly sent people to investigate, they could not reach their destination. Therefore, they could not provide a definite answer to those from their hometown inquiring about its safety. After our army retreated to the tenth line of defense, the association sent people to check yesterday and reported that the North Factory had been occupied by the Japanese army, but the factory buildings were still intact. However, there were a few bullet marks on the surrounding walls. Inside, the doors were open, and the belongings were placed as before. Upon further inspection of the funeral parlors, although many doors were open, all the coffins were unharmed. However, trenches had been dug in two places, and the west side room, which was the factory's kitchen, had sandbags and other defensive materials placed on the roof. There are still Japanese soldiers entering and leaving the area, and Zhang Zigen, the person left in charge of the factory, has disappeared, and his life or death is unknown.</p>
<p>Concession</p>
<h3>Expanding Opportunities for Water, Electricity, and Telephone Services</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the area east of North Sichuan Road has been borrowing water from the Public Concession's Shanghai Waterworks Company to supply users since the outbreak of the war. Now, the area west of North Sichuan Road is also borrowing water from the company. In addition, at the end of North Sichuan Road, the Shanghai Power Company has a transformer station. From today, it will feed electricity to the nearby Chinese area, to the north station and west of the railway. Currently, many are broken and lack trunk lines, but efforts will be made to transfer the feed to the trunk lines of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company's main water and electricity plant is located on the bank of Jungong Road and is currently occupied by the Japanese army, making it impossible to generate electricity and feed water. Therefore, water and electricity from the concession are temporarily borrowed so that residents can return home and live in peace. As for the telephone lines in the North Sichuan Road combat area, the Shanghai Telephone Company is also rapidly repairing them. However, because many users have moved elsewhere, it is impossible to ascertain the extent of damage to each household. But as soon as users notify them, they will immediately send people to repair them.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Chinese and Foreigners Going to Zhabei Area</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that, according to Colonel Thomas, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, after discussions between the Public Works Department and the Japanese authorities, several procedures have been determined for Chinese and foreign nationals who wish to go to the Zhabei area. ㈠ In the area between the Yangpu and Songhu Railways, the necessary procedures must be completed with the Public Works Department and the Japanese Military Headquarters at the North Railway Station. Foreigners who have property or businesses in the area will be given various conveniences, but entry to observe the war zone is strictly prohibited. Chinese citizens with special circumstances may also be allowed to go, but the number of such passes is limited and will not be issued lightly unless there is an extreme need. ㈡ Foreigners may freely enter and exit the area south of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and north of the Suzhou River for business purposes. Chinese citizens will be searched by the police before being allowed to enter at their discretion. ㈢ Chinese and foreign nationals holding green passes from the Public Works Department may freely enter and exit the area west of North Sichuan Road to the Songhu Railway. However, near the Japanese Garden, Chinese citizens must be accompanied.</p>
<p>Returning to the War Zone to Retrieve Items</p>
<h3>Taking the Opportunity to Steal Neighbors' Belongings</h3>
<p>Local resident Yuan Genbao, who lived at No. 17, Heng'anfang, Dade Lane, North Sichuan Road in the Public Concession, fled during the recent war and took refuge at No. 112, Xinxin Lane, Route Pére Robert in the French Concession. On the 5th of this month, when the war ceased, the war zone was opened for disaster relief and people were allowed to return home to move their belongings, Yuan also took the opportunity to return home. Unexpectedly, he had bad intentions and moved out eleven large and small leather suitcases, two rattan trunks, and two phonographs belonging to his co-residents Xie Shubin, Luo Shaotian, Wen Zhanpeng, Deng Darong, and the landlord Zhou Mengqi, along with his own belongings, and hid them at No. 37, Tiancheng Lane, Route Amiral Courbet and No. 20, Dapufang, Route Pére Robert in the French Concession. The victims discovered this and reported it to the French Police Station. Detectives Li Yousheng and Zeng Jiuru, along with private detectives Lu Songlin and Xu Liangcheng, went to arrest Gu, recovered the stolen goods, and took him to the police station. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Second Special District District Court, where Judge Wu Fanglian opened a criminal court to interrogate him. Police Station Lawyer Gu Shouxi prosecuted him for theft under Article 337 of the Criminal Code, stating that the landlord Zhou Mengqi, one of the victims in this case, could not be summoned, and there were still accomplices of the defendant who had not been apprehended. He requested a postponement of the trial. After Judge Wu's interrogation, he approved the postponement of the trial to the 14th and ordered Zhou Mengqi to be summoned to court. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Foreigners Praise China's Postal Service</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News published on the 3rd of this month that the port had not received foreign mail for many days, but suddenly a batch arrived yesterday, including London newspapers dated February 15 of this year, which shows that they were recently sent. Since the Sino-Japanese dispute spread from Pan Yangbinjiang to Shanghai, although the situation has been turbulent every day, the postal authorities have still been able to maintain their efforts, so that postal communications between Shanghai and Europe can still maintain their normal state. This achievement is considered by people to be miraculous, because we deeply know that this is not an easy situation to obtain. At the beginning of the Shanghai Incident, clever people, because they were lazy to write letters, actually put aside the letters that they should have written every week, thinking that if the recipient questioned them, they could use the excuse of the mail being delayed due to the war to perfunctorily deal with it. Unexpectedly, the facts were exactly the opposite of their ideal, and their skills were not successful, which is very shocking. In fact, there is nothing so-called wonderful about this situation, but it is the result of the postal service and all its employees, from top to bottom, focusing on their duties and being loyal and unswerving. Their spirit of serving the public is proven by the facts, and we should respect them. Upon investigation,</p>
<p>The handling of postal services in our country has indeed made a lot of progress in recent years. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the staff of the bureau were able to work in the midst of raging flames and deafening cannons approaching the war zone without interruption, handling matters in an orderly manner, and striving to maintain</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Both domestic and foreign mail without hindrance, which is not an easy task. Although it is due to the effective supervision of the authorities, it is also due to the loyalty and bravery of the staff, so that what is done is especially satisfactory to Chinese and foreign people.</p>
<h3>Important Postal Information Summary</h3>
<p>Shanghai Post Office News: Starting from March 8, the airmail service between Shanghai and Nanjing will be increased by one flight every day (including Mondays). The plane will fly from Nanjing at 8:30 AM every day and from Shanghai at 2:30 PM. All mail sent to Shanghai and along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway can be transshipped by airmail via Nanjing.</p>
<p>Also, the Shanghai Post Office announced that the 12th of this month, which is Saturday, is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's death. The post office, except for the savings office, remittance office, and parcel office, which will be closed all day, will operate at the same hours as on Sundays.</p>

The letter stated: "To whom it may concern, this time the 19th Route Army defended Shanghai, using fewer than 40,000 soldiers to resist the enemy's army, navy, and air force with their sharp weapons, repeatedly achieving victories and holding out for as long as 34 days. Although they later retreated due to the interception of their rear, our army's tenacity and good fighting skills have spread throughout China and abroad. The powerful enemy is impressed, and the international community has changed its views. The 19th Route Army's contribution to the country has been recognized by those in the know. When the army was in Shanghai, the enemy associations and people from all walks of life cooperated in supplying and transporting defense equipment and comfort items, ensuring harmony between the military and civilians and constantly renewing morale. Now that the army has retreated to your area, we urge your association to consider the purpose of military-civilian cooperation and have pity on their sincerity in defending the country. Please personally take the lead and cooperate with people from all walks of life to do your best to comfort them, so that the army will not feel any lack of what they need. The encouragement to the anti-Japanese soldiers will be of great importance. We hope you will investigate and handle this matter."</p>

<h3>Notice from the Bar Association to All Members</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Bar Association issued a notice to all members yesterday, stating: "Dear Members, Upon receiving a directive from the Jiangsu High Court, which in turn received an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, we are issuing this notification for compliance. It is found that lawyers are responsible for defense and have a very close relationship with the court. Any actions that may easily invite suspicion or slander should be given extra attention and strictly prohibited. In the future, if a lawyer has a blood relative within the fourth degree of kinship or a relative by marriage within the third degree of kinship with the president of the local court, the chief prosecutor, or the president of the county court within the area where they are registered and designated to perform their duties, they should apply for avoidance and not perform their duties in that area. If they have the above-mentioned degree of kinship with the presiding judge or judge due to handling a case, they should also implement avoidance to prevent favoritism. Moreover, lawyers living with judges and engaging in ordinary social interactions and entertainment are sufficient to leave people with something to criticize and should be strictly prohibited. In addition to distribution, this order is issued to the chief prosecutor to order his subordinate lawyers to strictly comply with the above three points. If there is any concealment or failure to avoid relocation, the lawyer will be immediately referred for disciplinary action once discovered, without any leniency. The chief prosecutor has the responsibility of supervision and should earnestly inspect and strictly implement this order. This is the order. (Omission) The association, after receiving the order, submitted it to the Executive Supervisory Committee for discussion and resolution, and forwarded it to all members for record. This notice is hereby issued for compliance."</p>

<p>Important Domestic and Foreign News</p>
<h3>League of Nations Conference Debate Ends</h3>
<p>To Reconvene on Thursday</p>
<p>Dr. Yen and Mr. Sato Speak in Succession</p>
<p>Small Nations Do Not Recognize the Acquisition of Any Rights by Force</p>
<p>The Assembly Should Take Necessary Actions for World Peace</p>
<p>(Geneva) The debate on the Sino-Japanese issue in the League of Nations Assembly, which has continued for several days, finally ended tonight. The drafting committee is now working on compiling various motions and drafting a general motion to be submitted to the Assembly for final consideration. The Assembly will likely reconvene on Thursday. There was a slight debate on the procedures to be used in drafting this motion, but the issue was quickly resolved. Czech Representative Pieness proposed that the drafting committee should be composed of the eight vice-presidents elected by the Assembly on March 3rd. All suggestions already submitted and to be submitted to the Assembly should be reviewed by these eight members of the drafting committee. Greek Representative Politis and others did not agree with this proposal. Assembly President Hymans made a statement of assurance, saying that the drafting committee should be guided not only by the proposals submitted to the committee but also by the principles discovered through general discussion. The opposition then fell silent. The drafting committee will meet at 4:00 PM tomorrow. The vice-presidents elected by the Assembly on March 2nd are: Poncet (France), Motta (Switzerland), Ramel (Sweden), Simon (England), Grandi (Italy), Padilla (Mexico), Beelaerts van Blokland (Germany), and Sebah-al-daulah (Persia). After today's great debate, the president invited Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Yen to speak, as the meeting was now gradually coming to the point.</p>
<p>Dr. Yen usually stood up from his seat to speak, but this time he left his seat and approached the podium, turning to face the audience. He addressed the audience in the quiet atmosphere of the meeting hall, first saying that he was grateful for the attendees' willingness to attend at his request. Almost every speaker had expressed support for the League of Nations Charter. The League of Nations Assembly should first focus on the mediation methods under Article 15 of the Charter. He also agreed with this point, but mediation had already been undertaken five months ago. The effect was known to all of us. China hopes that the Assembly will exert its other abilities under Article 15 and other provisions of the Charter. He believed that the declaration briefly indicated by British Representative Simon would, when submitted to the Assembly in the future, be nothing more than the memorandum issued by US Secretary of State Stimson on January 8th. The Chinese attitude, which speakers could not clearly understand, led to much confusion. In fact, China never requested the Assembly to adopt a behavior equal to an arbitrary act toward the Sino-Japanese dispute. However, the League of Nations Charter has been violated. 200,000 square miles of Chinese territory have been occupied by foreigners in violation of Article 10 of the Charter. Japan also refuses to submit to arbitration, which violates the Charter. All these are obvious facts. Now the League of Nations must tell Japan, "Withdraw your troops and allow us to help you resolve the dispute with China in a way that we approve." The resolution of the League of Nations to establish the Lytton Commission clearly stipulated that Japan's responsibility for withdrawing troops would not be affected by the organization of the investigation commission. Now Japan does not withdraw its troops but instead promotes the movement for Manchurian independence. In fact, when the Japanese troops withdraw, this movement will collapse. Finally, Dr. Yen thanked the speakers for expressing their noble opinions on the current difficult problem, and said that the speakers all said that the League of Nations would uphold the Charter. I, as the representative of China, would like to reiterate this request to the Assembly.</p>
<p>After Dr. Yen finished speaking, the president invited Japanese Representative Sato to speak. Sato also spoke from the podium, briefly outlining Japan's case, saying that Japanese Representative Matsudaira's arguments and the documents submitted by the Japanese representative to the League of Nations had clearly expressed Japan's attitude. The reason for Japan's military action was that its people were endangered.</p>

<p>Report</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>There was no other way. Japan did not want to use force to resolve the dispute with China, nor did it intend to undermine China's political and territorial integrity. What the Japanese are doing now has already been done by other countries and will continue to be done. China is unlike any other country, different from any country in Europe and America. Can the world find any country that bases its foreign policy on xenophobic sentiment? Sato also said that Japan did not want to apply military pressure. He wished to see the situation in Shanghai resolved by all countries together based on facts. Japan has supported the League of Nations from the beginning and has fulfilled the provisions of the Charter. Japan wishes to see the Charter implemented fully and entirely, but with the spirit of those who drafted the Charter. The Japanese government fully appreciates the efforts of the League of Nations Administrative Council and appreciates the efforts of the United States and the US representatives in Shanghai who have been working with other countries to restore peace.</p>
<p>At the afternoon meeting, when the representatives were discussing, US and El Salvadoran Representative Barrientos spoke, his meaning the same as the words of South Irish Representative Lester. He spoke of the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution of December 10th to ask the Japanese army to withdraw to the South Manchurian Railway area, saying that the League of Nations must repeatedly acknowledge the League of Nations Charter's fundamental principle, because that principle prohibits invasion, whether it be for the sake of collecting debt or for the sake of recovering other kinds of rights. Hungarian Representative Apponyi predicted that 1932 would be the most important year in the League of Nations' history, saying that it was most important to obtain some kind of substantive result from the current dispute. Now, whether the war has stopped or not is not yet certain, so the first thing to do is to stop the war. The Assembly must devote its full strength to this; the rest can be resolved in accordance with the direction of British Representative Simon's proposed motion.</p>
<p>British Representative Simon, after discussing with the US representatives in attendance at the Disarmament Conference, read aloud the official report sent from Shanghai. The report described the lines occupied by the Japanese army on March 6th, saying that the Japanese army occupied a line from northwest of Liuhe, passing through Loutang (one mile west of Jiading) to the west of Nanxiang, and reaching some points on the Suzhou River line. On March 7th, there were small contacts that often occurred when soldiers occupied new positions.</p>
<h3>Recent Photograph of Our Country's Chief Representative Yan Huiqing</h3>
<p>The report also mentioned the landing of Japanese reinforcements in Wusong, and stated that on-the-ground intelligence could only be obtained from the Japanese side because the details were hard to come by due to the retreat of the Chinese army.</p>
<p>After Simon read the report on the military situation, the Assembly resumed discussion. Haitian Representative Mayard and Bhutanese Representative Bartholomew both advocated maintaining the dignity of the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Bhutanese representative even allowed for assistance in any action that would guarantee the dignity of the Charter and others. Yugoslavian Representative Nasulanik said that the Assembly seemed to be establishing a kind of precedent by making an important resolution based on Article 15 of the Charter. In his opinion, this kind of resolution should be widespread in its implementation. The Assembly must use all the various methods in its power to resolve this difficult problem and avoid any plans that could obscure the true cause of this problem. South African Representative Walters spoke, saying that Japan, with undisclosed reasons, has not only failed to seek a solution to its difficulties through peaceful means but has also clearly disregarded its obligations under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. It is regrettable that China has so far been unable to quell its internal disagreements, but China's weakness cannot be used as an opportunity by powerful countries. He greatly admired the Japanese people's virtue, intelligence, courage, and patriotism. For this reason, he asked the Japanese people to change their war plan and use peaceful methods to end this dangerous dispute. The world now expects the strong and powerful guidance of great powers, and this guidance can be seen in action, not empty words. The question is, are the great powers satisfied with having this guidance? Next, Indian Representative Aga Khan said that from a historical perspective, India, China, and Japan have had long and close cultural and religious ties. Therefore, China and Japan should not fight each other but should seek mutual harmony and intellectual cooperation. The League of Nations Assembly should maintain a calm attitude and strive to mediate.</p>
<p>Aga Khan expressed his support for Simon's proposal and asked China and Japan to unconditionally await the League of Nations' resolution. Bolivian Representative Rose said that all</p>
<h3>Small Countries Cannot Recognize What is Acquired by Force</h3>
<p>Therefore, the principles of the Charter are the guarantee of the future of all small countries. As for the solution, the Charter has provided it. The Assembly should clearly indicate that the League of Nations has the power to take necessary actions for the sake of world peace. (Eighth day Reuters dispatch) (Geneva) ㈠ Representative Yan's recent speech to the Assembly won the applause of the entire audience for a long time. ㈡ Representatives from thirty-three countries severely condemned Japan's aggression. ㈢ The worldwide mobilization of anti-Japanese sentiment was completed today. ㈣ However, Japan's spiritual failure will inevitably provoke a military general offensive. ㈤ Therefore, our side's final military resistance is a matter of extreme urgency. (March 9th special dispatch)</p>
<p>Representative Yan Announces</p>
<h3>US Cooperation with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Yan Huiqing has announced the telegram he received from the Chinese Embassy in Washington regarding the United States' agreement to cooperate with the League of Nations Assembly's resolutions. It said that Secretary of State Stimson has cabled the US Ambassador to China, instructing him to participate in discussions on clearing the war situation. The League of Nations Assembly drafting committee must consider the proposals of Colombia, El Salvador, Greece, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Norway, and Spain, in addition to considering the British representative Simon's statement. The representatives of these countries have therefore been naturally included in the drafting committee.</p>
<p>The London Morning Chronicle reported that a ray of light has appeared in the gloom of the Far East, namely, that Britain and the United States are now working hand in hand and that the United States has earnestly cooperated with the League of Nations. These two things, in any case, are important and may facilitate both countries with an importance that cannot be measured at present. The situation in Shanghai has a gradual improvement in sight, so war risk insurance premiums have been reduced. The war risk insurance premium for goods transported from warehouses to warehouses in Shanghai by Japanese ships has been reduced by ten shillings per pound. For those transported by ships from other countries, except for Chinese ships, it was previously ten shillings but is now five shillings. In addition, the war risk insurance premium for goods passing through Shanghai and transported to Japan, Korea, and Manchuria has also been halved. (Ninth day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Incident</p>
<h3>Two Instructions from the Japanese Government</h3>
<p>An Instruction to the Japanese Representative to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Declaring China Refuses Unconditional Armistice</p>
<p>An Instruction to the Japanese Ambassador to China</p>
<p>Ordering Shigemitsu to Make Further Efforts to Agree on an Armistice</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a Reuters dispatch today, the Japanese government has instructed Sato, the Japanese representative to the League of Nations, to present the Chinese attitude on the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai, stating that China not only refuses an unconditional armistice, violating the League of Nations resolution, but also demands that Japan withdraw its troops first before an armistice. It also declares that Japan cannot consider withdrawing its troops until guarantees are in place to ensure the complete cessation of hostilities. At the same time, the Japanese government has also instructed Shigemitsu, the Japanese ambassador to China, to make further efforts to agree on an armistice as a preliminary step towards a roundtable conference. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th) In the British House of Commons today, Member of Parliament Louse requested</p>
<p>to be informed of the peace conditions proposed by Japan to China.

However, he would investigate and inform the questioner. In addition to being notified by the Japanese authorities to the British authorities in Shanghai acting as mediators, these conditions have also been telegraphed to Drummond, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russian Central Committee Members Express Their Views</h3>
<p>Protecting Peace Regarding the Far East Events (Moscow) Mikhail Kalinin, chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, declared today that preserving peace by all means is the primary fundamental condition of the Soviet Union's entire policy regarding the Far East events. If the policy of any capitalist country endangers the important interests of the Russian people, then the Russians cannot and do not want to coldly regard the actions of capitalist countries. At that time, the whole country will say that we are willing to fight to the end. The whole country must now prepare for this kind of struggle in order to reduce the worry that the Russians will be attacked, he said.</p>

<p>Important News 2</p>
<h3>Japan Pays Attention to the U.S. Boycott of Goods</h3>
<p>Due to the expanding situation of the U.S. boycott of goods, a special correspondent was sent to the U.S. to seek a way to ease the situation. The Japanese "Chugai Commercial News" received a United Press dispatch from New York stating that because the Sino-Japanese dispute has not ended, the economic severance of relations with Japan by the United States has taken concrete form. The "Association for Economic Severance of Relations with Japan," organized by industrialists across the United States, has officially issued a declaration and established a general headquarters in New York. The association is led by Gladys Lamont, daughter of Mr. Lamont, chairman of the Morgan Commercial Bank, and the great industrialist William Lippmann. The main figures in the association are all well-known industrialists from across the United States, and branch associations are also beginning to be organized in various states. Therefore, the anti-Japanese sentiment has been intensifying day by day. The content of the declaration states that if Japan seizes control of Manchuria and occupies a superior position in China, Japan will then invade the abundant resources of coal and iron in the mainland of China and the three eastern provinces. Japanese military institutions and warlords will gain huge benefits from this, and will further disrupt the peace and order of the entire world. Therefore, we should suppress their activities as early as possible. The original reason why we are resisting Japan is to make them deeply understand that the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Covenant of the League of Nations are by no means merely idealistic expressions that are impossible to implement.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported that the Administrative Committee of the National Christian Council of the United States has also issued a letter of support for the economic severance of relations with Japan, stating that we absolutely do not recognize the acquisition of the rights and interests of other countries by violating treaties and using military means. Moreover, they highly praise the appropriateness of Secretary of State Stimson's policies. Other organizations, such as the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church, have successively petitioned President Hoover to promptly and decisively implement an economic severance of relations with Japan. According to Dr. Corwin, a professor at Princeton University who is highly respected for his constitutional authority, in his opinion published in the New York Times, an economic severance of relations with Japan falls under the great power of the chief executive, the President, and does not require the approval of Congress. In the past, President Wilson resolutely implemented the arming of merchant ships without regard to the consent of Congress. However, in practice, he believed that major issues could be discussed with Congress.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported that since the two major incidents in Manchuria and Shanghai, the feelings of the American people toward Japan have become increasingly deteriorated. Recently, the Shibuya Youth Federation, headed by former Metropolitan Police Superintendent Miyata, initiated a request for the endorsement of national united youth groups, and dispatched a delegation of three envoys in the name of representatives of the youth of all Japan to tour cities in various states of the United States to seek to ease the anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States. Hiroshi Shinoda has been designated as the chief envoy, and two deputy envoys have been selected from Tokyo and Osaka. They are scheduled to depart in late March, first to New York and Washington, and then to visit officials in cities across the United States to seek the understanding of the United States and promote the situation in China and Japan. The trip is scheduled to last for two months, and all expenses will be donated by various parties.</p>
<p>The Kobe Shimbun reported that Prime Minister Inukai and Foreign Minister Yoshizawa, in view of the increasing anti-Japanese sentiment of the U.S. government and the American people, and fearing the implementation of an economic severance of relations with Japan, are urgently seeking remedial measures and planning to send a special envoy to the U.S. to mediate. However, within the government departments, the anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States is considered very strong, and it is feared that it cannot be reversed by the efforts of one or two people, so no one has been officially dispatched yet.</p>
<p>The Hochi Shimbun reported that Count Keigo Kiyoura, in order to ease the U.S. public opinion, at the request of the Japanese business community, telegraphed the various U.S. electric power associations, stating the content of the Sino-Japanese dispute, and entrusted the major U.S. newspapers to publish his statement in order to awaken the U.S. public opinion and ease the anti-Japanese sentiment. The content of his statement includes: (1) stating that the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Covenant of the League of Nations allow for measures of self-defense; (2) the Shanghai Incident was originally caused by Chinese provocations; (3) Japan still adheres to the Open Door Policy in China, which does not conflict with the U.S. policy; (4) the greed and tyranny of Chinese warlords show a complete lack of national concept, and there is no organization in domestic politics; (5) forcefully defending that the Japanese army did not commit any brutal acts in this war.</p>
<h3>Change of Troops Stationed Along the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that Han Fuju, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, previously dispatched the 20th Division of Sun Tongxuan to be stationed along the Jiaoji Railway to maintain defense, which was quite effective. Recently, Han, considering that the division had been stationed for a long time, should be transferred for training. On the 2nd, he summoned Sun Tongxuan to Jinan to discuss the transfer. Today (the 4th), Sun returned from Jinan to Zhoucun to arrange the departure of various units. After the division is transferred back, the 29th Division of Cao Fulin and the 74th Division of Qiao Lizhi will be dispatched to fill the positions. Currently, among the brigades under the 20th Division, except for the 59th Brigade of Zhao Xinde stationed in Zhanhua as a military reclamation force, the 58th Brigade of Zhang Shulin is stationed in Weixian, the 60th Brigade of Ma Jingong is stationed in Qingzhou, and the division headquarters and independent units are stationed in Zhoucun. They must be transported in batches. As for the division headquarters and independent units of the 29th Division, they are currently stationed in Jinan. Among the brigades under its command, except for the 87th Brigade of Rong Guangxing, which is stationed in Jiaozhou along the Jiaoji Railway, the 85th Brigade of Li Hanzhang is stationed in Dezhou, and the 86th Brigade of Chen Dexin is stationed in Dongchang. It is still uncertain whether the two brigades of Li and Chen will move east. Li Hanzhang came to Jinan yesterday to ask for instructions. Cao Fulin will lead the division headquarters to Zhoucun first. In addition, the 74th Division of Qiao Lizhi is currently stationed in Jinan. This morning, the 221st Brigade of Ma Guanyi of Qiao's division will first go to Weixian to replace Zhang Shulin's brigade, and the 222nd Brigade of Li Gaizhi will be stationed in the Qingzhou area.</p>
<h3>Change of Head of the Finance Department of Hubei Province</h3>
<p>He Chengjun temporarily concurrently serves as the head. All schools are suspended due to lack of funds. A dispatch from Hankou states that the finances of Hubei Province are becoming increasingly strained. Wu Guozhen, the head of the Finance Department, resigned because he could not cope with the situation. The successor is Yu Yuzhi. Yu is a member of the Provincial Party Committee and is temporarily acting on the order of He Chengjun. After taking office, he formulated five measures to reduce expenses. The original expenditure of 1,064,630 yuan for all political and educational departments was reduced to 816,540 yuan. Before a month had passed, Yu resigned again. As a result, no one dared to ask about the position of the head of the Finance Department. He was troubled by the search and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to send someone to preside over the matter, but he did not receive a reply. He then temporarily took over the position and appointed He Hehua, the mayor of Hankou, to review official documents on his behalf. He arrived at the department on the 7th to take office, but has not taken any measures yet. However, teachers and staff of provincial schools went on strike that day due to the excessive arrears in salaries. At the same time, Huang Jianzhong, the head of the Education Department, also resolutely resigned. The entire education system in the province was plunged into a state of stagnation. According to He Chengjun, the province's revenue this month is only over 100,000 yuan, which is not enough to cover maintenance expenses. Since teachers and staff do not understand the government's difficulties and have gone on strike, he is unable to cope with the situation. Based on this, the future of Hubei's finances and education is not optimistic. (March 7th)</p>
