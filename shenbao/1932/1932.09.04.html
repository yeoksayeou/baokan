<h3 id="c1">最近上海之勞資糾紛梓 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>勞資糾紛。原爲社會問題中最複雜最難解决之問題。而最近上海之勞資糾紛。則一方面因戰後社會環境之關係。增加其複雜之程度。一方面因勞資雙方思想之衝突。增加其解决之困難。</p>
<p>吾人猶億當六月初旬。上海日軍撤退時市商會曾電請中央黨部。切實消弭勞資之糾紛。内有「官鑑於我國現在之情况。勿再鶩崇高之理論。俾稍有資力者。不致以實業爲畏途」之語。資本家方面。蓋早已鑑及戰後實業</p>
<p>維持之困難。勞資糾紛蔓延之可慮。而欲預籌所以自救之方術矣。惟社會環境。具有小易抵抗之力量。苟非智識超羣手段特别靈妙之人。實無法爲裕餘之應付。上海資本家於戰後。一面欲以國家政治之力。維持其自身之生命。一面又無超羣之智識。不得不爲社會之環境所壓迫。結果勞資糾紛。不特無法銷弭。且蔓延至不可收拾。</p>
<p>上海之企業。受外人企業發展之刺激而興起。而現代西洋企業。爲受工業革命影響而來之資本主義的企業。則無可諱言。質言之。上海現在企業家之思想。其本體實含資本主義之性質也。而同時工人方面。自參加革命以來。多注意於主張權利。雖不致盡信餘利之說。而於其生活與職業之關係。則固視爲極重要者。以如此利益思想互相衝突之兩方。相處合作。以服務於企業界。其糾紛之難免。有識者早已洞察之矣。</p>
<p>吾人今試以三友實業社之勞資糾紛爲代表事件而一申論之其資方以戰後遭受損失。不能支持其業務。宣布停設滬廠。就資本家之立場言。固自有其相當之理由也。其勞方昔時與廠主共同努力於企業之發展。一旦停廠。生業無依。起而對抗。亦自有其根據。於此兩方各爲其本身利益而極力相爭時。各據其自已認定之理由與根據。不肯稍爲退讓。解决糾紛之責。乃落於國家法令所明定之官吏肩上。至官方調解仲裁而不能有效。則解决之路絕。其糾紛將永遠爲糾紛矣。</p>
<p>吾人不欲就糾紛中任何一方之態度。加以任何之批評。惟吾人有一信念。即人類社會生活。單注意於事實之一端。必不能有適宜之解决。而精神上之情緖的調和。乃爲人類生活之正規。上海各企業家。曾結合以助三友社之資方。各工會亦紛起爲勞方援應。社會人士已各有所努力。惟此種努力。不用之於調和雙方情緒之正當工作。乃用於使雙方益增隔　之方面。未免稍有缺憾耳。</p>
<p>美國愛爾烏特教授。以社會的一般覺悟。爲解决社會問題之先决問題。　請移此語以贈最近上海勞資糾紛之關係者。</p>

<p>二一枝譚</p>
<p>[P蘇白和狀詞</p>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>言中說到白字，便要說皎然而白說到黑字，便要說黝然而黑；那麽，這個白字或黑字，便來得有力；皎然和黝然;都是文法中的狀詞。</p>
<p>蘇白中的狀詞，尤其占着重要部分；要研究蘇白的，必須研究蘇白中的狀詞。</p>
<p>紅噴噴，綠油油，青鬆鬆，白膚膚，這一類的疊字狀詞，都是位置在紅，綠，青，白的下面。有時，也可位置在上面，不過論調要變換了；要說：兇兇紅，碧碧綠，生生青，雪雪白。滴溜圓，搨蠟扁，攏統丨讀作六秃丨濕，的角方，拍鋪满，：：：這些兩字狀詞，都是位置在上面的。</p>
<p>滴溜滾圓，百合爛皺，夾了死白，的角四方，蠟揷焦黄，希秃落濕，：：這些三字狀詞，都是形容下面一個字：宛比滴溜滾三字，只是形容下面一個圓字罷了；其他，可以類推。</p>
<p>黑出六篤，僵希哈喇，軟皮搭角，熱吹怕　，遠頂不到，毛替他拖，：：：：這些三字狀詞，都是形容上面一個字：宛比次怕燙三字，只是形容上面一個熱字罷了；其他；可以類推。</p>
<p>蘇州的白話文法，是很複雜的；單論一種狀詞，已有這許多的不同；無怪僑蘇的客籍，任憑老蘇州任，憑一口蘇白，但是，不知不覺之中，便要露出强蘇白的馬脚來。</p>
<h3 id="c51">時代下幾個必然的人物 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 徐本熈</p>
<p>丨舞客鄭孝胥富翁丨</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>一個朋友的朋友於半個月前死了，他的死，是在跳舞塲淘虚了毫無抵抗力的體魄傳染了「虎列刺」而致死的，據說：他在奄奄一息的當兒，曾經流着淚用最微弱的呼聲說：「我追悟我不曾到沙塲上同敵人拼一拼而死丨」</p>
<p>「人之將死，其言也善，」陶醉於Waltz，Foxtrot的時代裏，教他掮着槍上戰塲是可能嗎？</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>受敵掌之賜的鄭孝胥在哼詩了，他的詩說：「孤蓧向日原不媚，斷流趨海總無還：」大概他也知道了前途是必然地幻滅，所以當時「袍笏登塲」的豪興，已這樣消沈不過，老鄭不必悲哀，大丈夫說一句亢爽語「十八年後又是一條好漢丨」老鄭整備着罷。</p>
<p>人在满懷得意的時候，他是什麽也不會想到「命運會没落」這一句話的。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>某一個鄕村在敵軍盤踞着時，村裏一位擁有「洋房與財産」的富翁，和敵人簽訂了一張於敵人有片面利益的合同，這一張合同，現在已經被一個漢奸的妻子從敵人手裏拿得而向法院控告了，理由是有「通敵嫌疑，」有人說富翁通敵不是事實，爲保全個人「洋房與財産」而訂合同是無疑。</p>
<p>富翁終於被一紙合同而受制於漢奸，他爲的是「洋房與財産，」</p>

<p>— 茵</p>
<p>房屋從外國撑來，音樂不可一刻不聽　　我住長江南岸；所以這次暴日侵入内地江邊之後，我們全家遷避來滬，就在這時候，我做了人家的女教師。這人家的住宅，是新築的，確是十二分的毆美化：並且附近一帶的住宅，都是屬於這位主人。建設是完全適合新時代的。我每天往來這裏，總感到上海確有一種新氣象，緊緊隨在歐美之後，誰說落在人後呢？但是我仔細考查詢問之下。才知道這許多新時代式的屋，自屋頂至屋基以及門窗户闥，小至螺旋釘，都是美國工廠出産品，輸到我們中國來的，有一句俗諺說：屋不能撑着走的。這句諺語也是時代的落伍者，因爲現在上海新建的屋，凡含些新時代性的，恐怕都從外國去撑來的呀。若然把國産的建設品來造，一定依舊土老兒式罷。　　這人家的女主人，自朝至暮很忙碌，我並不研究伊忙的是甚麽？不過覺得伊不是外出就是有客在家。有一位常來的女客，年紀很輕，漸漸和我相熟了。當然的，伊是有錢人家的少奶奶。每次我聽到馬路上有汽車喇叭聲，聲調是拉丨沙米沙丨我知道必定是伊來了，這種有音樂聲韻的喇叭，恐怕流行到上流還不久罷。最特色的，這位女客的府上裝着最時式的無線電話，在家時常常聽着，還聽得不夠，特地在汽車上也裝了無線電話，以便隨時可聽，沿路可聽，聽說夏夜兜風，在荒凉的馬路上開着無線電話，是别有趣味的。像這位太太，可謂愛好音樂的了。</p>
<h3 id="c53">參觀劉獅的畫展後 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 陀</p>
<p>丨想起三種必經的過程丨</p>
<p>不單是劉獅的畫，不論什麽人的畫，也只要是成功的畫，三種過程是誰也不能免去的。第一是學習的時期，第二是徬徨的時期；第三是創作的時期。不論是對古的追求，或對近人的摹擬，都是屬於第一時期所有的普遍現象。這種現象在中國現代的畫壇上也是很普遍地在反映出來。至於徬徨時期，就是在方法上愛好的取捨問題所引出來的必然結果。因爲在這時期。技巧的修養上已有過相當訓練，前代作家的特長也有相當的認識，可是對於自已怎樣去表現到畫幅上的問題，倒成了當前最大的難關。加以同時代已成名的各作家，各各憑了他們自已的意像，在作品上化成五花八門地不息加以引誘，這時古人的鬚眉，今人的手法，使他只有在迷魂陣中徬徨。可是繪畫上最大也是最要的問題則爲創造，否則就非成功的繪畫丨返觀國内各作家陷於成功之彼岸者，學習者總有十分之五，徬徨者總有十分之三四，創作的丨成功的只有十分之一二而已丨劉獅最近所畫的，當然不能說已到了極成熟的創造期，可是他自普陀歸來後最近的畫幅，雖在表現上還不能脫去西歐畫壇的影響，可是以劉獅最近畫幅上所有急進的變遷，同劉獅在年齡上還站在最初底青春期的一點，他那創作的萌芽，的確給了我們以極可靠的安慰的證據了。</p>
<p>（萍附記）：我昨天欣賞劉獅畫展以後，異常興奮，像他這樣年纔弱冠的青年，而西畫作品竟如此優美，眞是值得驚異與艶羨！在他一百四十五點傑作中，不論是叢林，原野；幽雅的水鄕，蒼茫的海濱；或是一個少女的容顔，一束美麗的花朶；在他的筆下，都寫得流利生動，尤其是幾幅滬戰速寫，描寫戰士　戰於砲火連天之中，沉着應戰，出死入生，神勇可敬。，還有那滬戰遺痕，一片頽垣廢址，想見流亡之慘，使我更深了一層悲憤的印象。</p>
<p>觀劉獅最近的作風，大有法國畫家郁却里羅（Utrillo）的神韻，以君天才，將來也不難追踪。據海粟先生言，明歲中德畫展時將挈獅赴歐研究，希望獅君勿「夜郎自大」，繼續努力，更求遠大的成功。</p>
<h3 id="c54">銀絲（四） <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 江紅萑</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>他並且自已也來指揮，告訴我們不要開槍，不要放砲，必須等敵人走近，和他肉搏，丢擲手溜彈，一定可得最後的勝利。我們弟兄都很信任，服從團長的話，所以照了他的命令做。啊！可怕啊！我親眼瞧見離開我們二百米達，我們的弟兄被敵人的炸彈和砲火活埋在地裏；我親眼瞧見我們的弟兄，被敵人衝鋒殘殺；我也親自聽得我們弟兄臨死凄厲的最後呻吟。但是我們的袁團長，曾再三的告誡我們，一定要死，死在敵人的槍刺上，才有光榮，戰線是這麽長，兵力配置很困難，我們大家再死守一二天，便有大批援軍可以開到。這小鎭决不能失掉，於軍略上極有關係，惟其是重要，所以不能多置重軍，免使敵人注意，你們勇敢些，要死我和各位弟兄一起死在這鎭上，是十分光榮的！我們聽了他的話，所以格外不怕死。有一次，敵人衝鋒過來，被我們的機關槍掃射死了兩百多；還有一次，團長又親自來指揮，命三四個兵士，在前面壕溝裏跑來跑去，向敵方放步槍，敵方以爲這壕溝裏軍隊很多便大放重砲，整整地放了一小時半，把這條壕溝都轟成平地，但是我方却停止一切聲音，不再放槍，敵人以爲我方的弟兄都已死盡，他先派了幾個后人來試探，放了幾次槍以後，接着便是大隊的人馬來了，我們等他走近，便大擲手溜彈，大開機關槍，敵人猝不及防，急忙退走，却已死得不少。</p>
<p>「我自從余二姐的屋子坍了以後，軍隊裏不許我再煮飯，他們每天送一些乾糧給我吃。」　　「我屢次想見見袁團長，但是始終没有見到的機會聽說有一次，他親自丢一個炸彈，炸死了敵方一個隊長，和一個吹號手，他還奪獲了一方敵人的旗幟。</p>
<p>「你們想吧　這袁團長是多麽勇啊！你們想吧！姓余的是多麽威風！他姓袁，我也姓袁，他是我的丈夫呀！怎像你們只會躱在狗洞裏逃命？：：：　　伊又到瘋的狀態，誰也不去再理會伊；但是也有幾個年輕的女子，正在遐想着，抱着這位袁團長親一次吻，也是很有意味，三生有幸而很有光榮。</p>
<h3 id="c55">袞袞滾滾 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 父</p>
<p>國勎日亟，國内的紛亂，也越多！赳赳的武人，有槍有彈不免要弄些戰事來頑頑，莘莘學子旡拳旡勇，祇靠着毛錐利口，也是陸續不斷地，要閙點風潮出來。當然，我這是專指事實，不曾，也不敢詳斷他們的是非曲直，可是至少因此而多些紛擾，是不可諱的事情。而尤其閙得最有聲色，而影響最大的，要算這次中大的風潮，結果，是把個全國最高學府閙成一個「捲堂大散，」這使我不禁回憶起三十年前，一樁趣史來，張文達公百熈剏辦大學，在開學之前，大宴校中教職員，酒酣耳熱，更對諸人說：「我們初次辦學，」困難是很多的，將來辦得好，是「袞袞諸公，」要是辦不好，祇好請「諸公滾滾！」萬不料興學數十年的現時教育界，還會閙出這等「滾滾」風潮來，那何怪最初興學的「袞袞諸公」自然要免不了「滾滾」之誚了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Recent Labor-Capital Disputes in Shanghai <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Labor-capital disputes are originally the most complex and difficult problem to solve in society. Recently, labor-capital disputes in Shanghai have increased in complexity due to the post-war social environment on the one hand, and increased in difficulty to resolve due to the conflict of ideas between labor and capital on the other.</p>
<p>I still remember that in early June, when the Japanese troops withdrew from Shanghai, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Central Party Headquarters, earnestly requesting the elimination of labor-capital disputes. It included the words: "Officials, in view of the current situation in our country, should no longer blindly pursue lofty theories, so that those with some financial resources will not regard industry as a dangerous path." The capitalist side had already foreseen the difficulty of maintaining industries after the war and the worrying spread of labor-capital disputes, and wanted to prepare ways to save themselves in advance. However, the social environment has a power that is difficult to resist. If it is not a person with extraordinary knowledge and particularly clever means, it is really impossible to cope with the surplus. After the war, Shanghai capitalists wanted to maintain their own lives with the power of national politics on the one hand, and had no extraordinary knowledge on the other, so they had to be oppressed by the social environment. As a result, labor-capital disputes not only could not be eliminated, but also spread to an unmanageable extent.</p>
<p>The enterprises in Shanghai arose under the stimulation of the development of foreign enterprises. Modern Western enterprises are capitalist enterprises influenced by the Industrial Revolution, which is undeniable. In other words, the ideas of Shanghai entrepreneurs now essentially contain the nature of capitalism. At the same time, workers have paid more attention to advocating for their rights since participating in the revolution. Although they may not completely believe in the theory of surplus value, they regard the relationship between their lives and occupations as extremely important. It has long been seen by insightful people that disputes are unavoidable when these two parties with conflicting ideas of interests cooperate to serve the business community.</p>
<p>Today, let us take the labor-capital dispute of the Sanyou Industrial Society as a representative event and elaborate on it. The capital side announced the closure of the Shanghai factory because it suffered losses after the war and could not support its business, which is justified from the capitalist's point of view. The labor side worked hard with the factory owner to develop the enterprise in the past, but once the factory is closed, they have no means of livelihood, so they rise up to resist, which is also justified. When these two parties are vying for their own interests, each according to their own recognized reasons and bases, and are unwilling to make any concessions, the responsibility for resolving the dispute falls on the officials clearly stipulated by national laws and regulations. If the official mediation and arbitration are not effective, the road to resolution is cut off, and the dispute will forever be a dispute.</p>
<p>We do not want to make any criticism of the attitude of any party in the dispute. However, we have a belief that human social life cannot have a proper solution if we only pay attention to one aspect of the facts. The emotional harmony of the spirit is the norm of human life. Shanghai entrepreneurs have united to help the capital side of the Sanyou Society, and various labor unions have also risen up to support the labor side. People from all walks of life have made efforts, but this kind of effort is not used for the proper work of harmonizing the emotions of both sides, but is used to increase the separation between the two sides, which is somewhat regrettable.</p>
<p>Professor Elwood of the United States regards the general awareness of society as a prerequisite for solving social problems. Please move this sentence to those involved in the recent labor-capital disputes in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The League of Nations Investigation Team's General Report Signed Yesterday <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>All 300 Pages Carried to Geneva by the German and French Commissioners</p>
<p>Two Sealed Copies Left for the Chinese and Japanese Governments to be Opened Later</p>
<p>Lytton and the American and Italian Commissioners Scheduled to Fly South This Morning</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lytton, accompanied by Haas, Deputy Secretary-General Pelt, and staff member Astor, visited Zhang Xueliang at 4 pm to say goodbye. After exchanging pleasantries with Zhang, Zhang treated them with champagne and took a commemorative photo. The commissioners signed the general report at the Beijing Hotel, completing all 300 pages. The German and French commissioners will take it to Geneva. Haas is scheduled to leave Ping on the 14th. The Japanese representative, Shiozaki, and six Japanese staff members went to Tanggu this morning with 40 pieces of luggage to make arrangements. Yoshida will go to Dalian on the 4th and return to Japan quickly. Lytton is rushing to complete the closing procedures late tonight. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The commissioners of the investigation team held a meeting at the Beijing Hotel this morning to sort out various documents. The investigation materials provided by overseas Chinese from various countries were compiled into a separate statement for the League of Nations General Assembly to refer to. The report has been completed. Lytton and the American and Italian commissioners are scheduled to fly to Ping by Ford aircraft tomorrow morning. The German and French commissioners will go to Tanggu tomorrow afternoon, take a ship to Dalian, and transfer to Siberia to return to Europe. The five commissioners visited Zhang Qun at 4 pm today to say goodbye. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The conclusion of the League of Nations Investigation Team's report will be kept strictly confidential before it is delivered to the League of Nations Administrative Council, and it is impossible to know its outline. However, according to news revealed by diplomatic circles, the investigation team's suggestions for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute are roughly based on the League of Nations Covenant, recognizing China's territorial sovereignty in the eastern provinces. As for the disputes arising from treaty rights, it will be suggested that China and Japan start negotiations under the supervision of the League of Nations, or that the General Assembly continue to mediate. As for the legal part, it may be handed over to the International Court of Justice for resolution. However, it is still unknown whether the Japanese side will have the sincerity to abide by the Covenant. It is especially worrying that it will use the shortcomings of the Covenant to create de facto acts of war. Therefore, our country must strive for diplomacy on the one hand, and consolidate its strength on the other, in order to prepare for the final resistance. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Investigation Team's report was completely compiled last night. After being circulated among the commissioners on the afternoon of the 3rd, the commissioners signed it. Thus, the entire report was completed. The conclusion of the report is very short, only three pages typed by typewriter. Sir Lytton's original draft was a purely theoretical solution that was quite unfavorable to Japan. Later, with the efforts of French Commissioner General Gurot, it was slightly revised to be more practical, but the entire report is still very unfavorable to Japan. Although the solution is mainly based on direct negotiations between China and Japan, the point that the League of Nations participates is ultimately unacceptable to Japan. (3rd Telegraphic News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Reuters learned today that the report of the Lytton Investigation Team has been unanimously agreed upon by the commissioners. The report was completed on Thursday, and the commissioners immediately began to make copies. After the copies were proofread by the commissioners, which took a whole day, the commissioners made various revisions. Then, the copies were returned to the typists, who worked all night to complete the final draft. Lord Lytton and the other commissioners are now proofreading the draft. Before the commissioners take the plane to Shanghai, they will sign it. Each copy will be signed by five people. The content has not been notified to China and Japan, but two sealed copies have been left, one for the Chinese government and one for the Japanese government, to be opened on the same day and at the same time as the report arrives in Geneva. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lord Lytton and the other commissioners all bid farewell to Zhang Xueliang this afternoon. They will fly directly to Shanghai by plane tomorrow, which will take about five and a half hours. They will depart at about 10 am, so they will arrive in Shanghai between 3 and 4 pm on Sunday. The plane is privately owned by Zhang Xueliang. American Commissioner General McCoy and his wife, Italian Commissioner Count Malscoti, Zhang Xueliang's advisor Donald, and Lord Lytton's secretary Astor will all travel together. French Commissioner General Claute and German Commissioner Dr. Schnie intend to return to Europe via Siberia. According to foreign news from Harbin, the transportation to the west of Harbin is currently blocked. The Japanese authorities in Harbin are willing to provide an airplane for Dr. Schnie and any members of the investigation team to use. If accepted, the Japanese airplane will carry Schnie and others from Harbin to Manchuria, where they will transfer to the Siberian Railway train. The Japanese officials' offer is intended to confirm the claim that the Volunteer Army occupied Anda, causing the transportation from Harbin to Manchuria to be completely blocked. It is reported that the Japanese army is currently attacking the Volunteer Army on this route, which is led by Li Haicheng. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The report of the Lytton Investigation Team has now been completed. It is heard that the next League of Nations General Assembly in Geneva will not consider it, but a special meeting may be convened in early October to handle it. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Yu Pass Is Peaceful <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Rumors from Tianjin and Peiping that Foreigners Have Left Yu Pass</p>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) Yu Pass is peaceful. Today, it is rumored from Tianjin and Peiping that the Japanese army in Yu Pass has set a time limit for foreigners from various countries to withdraw from Yu Pass before the 10th. Investigations are being conducted from relevant parties. This information is completely unfounded. The captain of the Japanese garrison in Yu Pass, Otowa, recently expressed to our relevant personnel that he would always maintain the peace of Shanhaiguan with a friendly spirit. Rumors from the outside should not be believed. In addition, the British, French, and Italian troops stationed in Yu Pass have returned to Peiping and Tianjin to garrison after the summer vacation, except for a small number left in Yu Pass. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign news: Since yesterday and today, foreigners from various countries have been arriving in Peiping and Tianjin from Yu Pass in an endless stream. It is said that they received an informal notice from the Japanese side in Yu Pass, advising them to open Yu Pass before the 10th and retreat to a safe zone. According to news from transportation方面, the Japanese army recently verbally notified foreigners from various countries in Yu Pass to leave Yu Pass before the 10th of this month. The local people are uneasy. Rumors are spreading that there will be actions within the Japanese. Merchants are moving one after another. Our garrison is extremely calm. Except for the relocation of Japanese military exercises, there is no superficial change in the Japanese army. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Zhang Xueliang Plans to Go South to Meet Jiang and Wang <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Qun Went to Jin with Xu Yongchang Yesterday</p>
<p>Organizational Regulations of the Military Branch Arrived in Ping</p>
<p>(Beiping) It has been reported in the newspapers recently that Song Ziwen has repeatedly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to come to Beijing to discuss financial issues in North China. However, rumors have been rampant in Peiping and Tianjin recently, and people are generally worried about the situation after Zhang's temporary departure from Peiping. The reporter specially visited a certain aide of Zhang's and learned that the "86" political turmoil has gradually subsided, but there is still no sign of political development and the national crisis is even more urgent, and there is no easier way to deal with it. Nanjing Song Ziwen expects Zhang to come to Beijing to discuss national affairs, but Zhang has not expressed his opinion. However, given the current situation, the military responsibility in North China has been taken over by the Military Branch, and the local responsibility has been taken over by the provinces. Zhang, in his capacity as an in-office, assists in national affairs, and his actions are naturally more free than when he was in office. Therefore, in the near future, Zhang may go to Hankou to meet Jiang, and to Beijing to meet Wang and Song. For the specific plans to jointly overcome the national crisis, there may be more concrete discussions to fulfill his personal obligations. Looking at Zhang's intention, it seems that he does not want to be the head of North China. In addition, a certain newspaper in Tianjin criticized Zhang for still living in the Shuncheng Prince's Mansion as inappropriate. According to this, this is Zhang's private residence, which is different from the public office. Even though Zhang is not in office, should he not have the right to live freely? Also, the Hong Kong newspapers and Japanese newspapers have recently criticized the director of the Palace Museum. Zhang has never been involved in the affairs of the Palace Museum. Those responsible will bear their responsibilities. Zhang once expressed to others that he would not overstep his authority, let alone take the blame for others, and Chiang Kai-shek is probably unaware of the inside story of the Palace Museum.

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Qun talked about the fact that he and Xu Yongchang will go to Jin tonight and stop briefly before going to Hankou to visit Jiang and report on various matters. At the moment, whether it is tough diplomacy or yielding diplomacy, a definite method must be determined to deal with it. The Military Branch in Ping has been established, and there will definitely be no problems with its content. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The director of the Military Branch Office will be Wan Fulin. The candidates for the chief of the department are roughly Rong Zhen, Wang Shuchang, and Bao Wenyou.

<p>(Jinan) At 6:20 pm, Zhang Zongchang went to the Jinpu Station with Jin Jinliang, Xu Xiaolou, and Chen Ming, planning to take the 10th train at 6:40 pm to return to Ping. Shi Yousan and dozens of Zhang's old subordinates came to the station to see him off. Zhang chatted about the current situation in the passenger car for about a quarter of an hour. At 6:30 pm, he got off the car and went to the platform to send off the welcomers. At that time, two people suddenly appeared from the crowd, holding box guns and pointing at Zhang. The crowd was shocked. Zhang ran east along the platform. The assassin chased closely and shot Zhang once at the northeast of the platform on the 7th rail. Zhang fell under the platform, facing southwest and lying prone. At that time, an assassin shouted, "I am Zheng Jicheng, son of Zheng Jinsheng, avenging my father!" Then he jumped down to the fallen road and shot Zhang several times in the head. He escaped dozens of steps to the east and was captured by the military police stationed at the station. One person confessed that his name was Zheng Jicheng, son of Zheng Jinsheng, 40 years old, a city person, and Chen Fengshan, 28 years old, from Henan, a former subordinate of Zheng. Zheng shouted that he was avenging his father and had no regrets, and that he had brought glory to the people of Lu. It was planned to carry Zhang to Jinan Hospital, but he was already dead when he arrived. After giving him a shot of adrenaline, the doctor said that there was no hope. He was hit by four bullets, one from the left cheek into the back of the right brain, one in the left eye, four or five inches deep, one in the left head, and one in the left foot.

<p>(Nanjing) Chen Gongbo talked about the fact that although all parties advocated waiting for the Third Plenary Session to decide on the successor to the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the League of Nations General Assembly is approaching, which is a time of extreme seriousness in Sino-Japanese diplomacy. The survival of our nation and nation depends on the actual political responsibility of the central government of the Premier of the Executive Yuan. The overall plan for foreign affairs depends on his leadership. This seat cannot be suspended for a long time and should be selected by the central government as soon as possible to respond to this critical difficulty and avoid long-term proxy. Although there is a plan to convene the Third Plenary Session within the year, there are about a dozen members who are responsible for suppressing bandits and cannot be separated to come to Beijing. If the work of suppressing bandits can be completed quickly, the plenary session is expected to be held within the year, otherwise it will be postponed to the beginning of next year.

<p>(Nanjing) Shao Yuanchong said that since the establishment of the Legislative Yuan four years ago, the legislative work has never been interrupted.

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Executive Committee notified all central committee members on the 3rd, stating that the Third Plenary Session was postponed. The original telegram is recorded as follows: "In accordance with the provisions of the general charter of our party, the plenary meeting of the Central Executive Committee shall be held at least once every six months. The third plenary meeting of this session shall be convened in September of this year. However, at present, the suppression of bandits is progressing rapidly, and there are quite a few central committee members who are responsible for military affairs. During this period, it is difficult to spare time to attend the meeting. After serious discussion by the committee, it was unanimously agreed that since there are practical obstacles, it is appropriate to make changes and handle them. There are also precedents for postponing the plenary meetings of the second and third sessions. Therefore, the 36th Standing Committee resolved to postpone the Third Plenary Session. However, at this time of serious national crisis, all major plans for domestic and foreign affairs depend on the joint efforts of all comrades in the central government to proceed. Although the plenary meeting has been postponed, it is still hoped that the central committee members scattered in various places will gather in the capital so that the central government can be further consolidated. I hereby report to you, and I hope you will take care of it. Seal of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Since the two standing committee members of the Central Political Council, Jiang and Hu, were not in Beijing, Wang proposed to temporarily elect two central committee members to act as their positions. The central government telegraphed Jiang and asked him to entrust an agent to act on his behalf. Soon, Jiang telegraphed back, still asking Wang to preside. If there are indeed practical difficulties, then please mutually elect one person from the central committee to act on his behalf. Later, the standing committee members still insisted on asking Wang to take on the responsibility, and there was no need to do anything more. Therefore, this proposal has been dismissed. Wang said that when the Central Political Council adopted the chairman system in the middle of the year, the chairman could not attend the meeting and could entrust someone to act on his behalf. If he cannot attend the meeting in the future, he can also follow this system. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Reset the Gold Unit Exchange Rate</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Chinese Consulate's cargo certificate was originally set at a total of five gold units of customs duty per year. It also stipulated the external gold coins of various countries. Recently, due to the sharp drop in Japanese gold and the previous regulations that four yuan of Japanese gold should be exchanged for five gold units of customs duty, the losses have been great. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance have specially consulted and, according to the latest market price of Japanese gold, stipulated that about 7.56 yuan of Japanese gold should be exchanged for five gold units. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance have notified the embassies and consulates in Japan and the customs to know. According to customs statistics, since 1930, the average number of imported goods has reached 5 million pieces per year. This visa cargo certificate is calculated at six gold units per piece, and 4 million can be collected annually. (3rd Dispatch)</p>

I know nothing about it, they just tell me to stamp my seal. It's just a signboard of the 'Manchukuo'. It's not enough to be a puppet. I quite approve of the divorce from Wenxiu. The second mistress of the Beifu (Northern Mansion), namely Pu Tang Shixia, is too shameless. She robbed me of five or six hundred thousand worth of things and went to Shanghai. Now I see that Second Master Jie is remarrying in Changchun. Please tell the Taifei that she doesn't need to come to see me anymore, as the Japanese might stop her and she won't be able to see me."

<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reports that since the Investigation Team's second visit to Japan and meeting with Foreign Minister Uchida, the Empire's attitude on the issue of recognizing Manchuria (the puppet state) has been recognized by the various nations. However, when the League of Nations deliberates on the Manchurian issue in Geneva in November, the tendencies of the countries attending the League of Nations General Assembly are expected to be as follows: (1) British officials and the public alike believe that Japan's actions in Manchuria have been handled improperly. (2) Some public law scholars and diplomats in the United States condemn Japan as an aggressor. In particular, American women's groups condemn the Japanese military's bombing with airplanes and the cruelty of the Japanese army, accusing the Japanese of being inhumane. However, the business community in that country is paying attention to the economic aspects of Manchuria. (3) Germany regards Japan's actions in Manchuria as similar to the criticisms leveled against Germany by various countries before and during World War I. (4) Russia is not strongly opposed to Japan as long as Japan does not threaten its borders or infringe on its interests. (5) Italy has a relatively shallow relationship with the Far East. Government officials believe that if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations due to the Manchurian issue, Italy will take the same action as Japan. (6) France is the most well-intentioned toward Japan among the great powers and understands Japan's policies. Furthermore, the Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun comments on the situation of the great powers regarding Japan's recognition of Manchuria, saying that regardless of the trends in the world, Japan's policy of recognizing Manchuria (the puppet state) is a fixed and unchangeable policy. In the past, the opinions of the government and the people were in conflict, but now the entire country is completely united. However, it is necessary to be concerned about causing a major global upheaval due to small disputes between China and Japan. However, we speculate that the League of Nations and the great powers have no real relationship. Although the United Kingdom does not express goodwill towards Japan on the Manchurian issue, and it does not understand Far Eastern affairs, even if there is a small amount of malicious incitement, in the future it will only verbally or morally blame Japan, and there will never be any active action. Next is Italy, which has no interest in the Far East and will definitely not want to interfere too much. Russia seeks to protect its borders and has always feared that Manchuria and Japan would collude to invade its borders. If Japan recognizes Manchuria, the next country to recognize it will be Russia. Germany has no connection to Manchuria. People in that country are extremely indifferent to the Manchurian issue. Only the United States has expressed maliciousness towards our actions. However, those who oppose Japan are only adhering to the preconceptions of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. It is proud of its self-esteem due to its historical traditional relationship. Other small and weak countries harbor feelings of sympathy for similar situations and oppose Japan when the League of Nations meets. However, when the League of Nations deliberates on the Manchurian issue, if the small and weak countries form a confrontation with Japan along with one or two major powers, our country will also have corresponding preparations. The outcome of this deliberation is of great importance to the rise and fall of our country's national fortune.</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 2nd: Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, is visiting important officials and bankers in the United States, but his whereabouts are kept secret, and no one knows where he is. Therefore, people in London are paying great attention. The London Daily Express claims that Norman is discussing financial issues in the United States, but it is not yet known whether it is to consolidate his personal position in the Bank of England or to promote his country's interests. It also stated that at a time when countries are denouncing secret diplomacy, Norman's trip is a dangerous model. According to nimble opinions here, after Norman returns to England, formal diplomatic negotiations on war debts and the cancellation of war debts will begin. In the future, the agency that initiates diplomatic negotiations will be Norman's report. A professor who calls himself Skinner is currently discussing various issues with American bankers and officials. The main points of his discussion are as follows: (1) Canceling or reducing Europe's debt to the United States by $11 billion. (2) Raising international short-term debt of $5 billion. (3) Establishing an agreement to raise prices, as low prices are one of the biggest reasons for the depression in commerce. (4) Reducing the Bank of England's discount rate to encourage the raising of debt and the movement of price inflation. (5) The UK restoring the gold standard, etc. However, according to official news, Professor Skinner's trip to the United States is for the purpose of restoring his health. In fact, the so-called Skinner is the name used by Norman, the Governor of the Bank of England, when he landed in the United States. According to news obtained in Washington, Norman has laid the foundation for diplomatic negotiations on the war debt issue. Officials said that the United States does not expect the United Kingdom to pay off the war debts it owes itself and the Allies when the war debt matures on December 15.</p>

<p>Havas, London, 2nd: Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, spoke about the tense situation in Shanghai and repeatedly stated how hard the Mayor of Shanghai worked to stop the anti-Japanese movement. He believed that if the Japanese did not cooperate with him and instead continued to make the situation increasingly serious, the Mayor's efforts would be in vain. Ambassador Guo also believed that Uchida's recent speech and Japan's conclusion of a so-called defense alliance with Manchuria would anger public opinion throughout China and make it more difficult for the Chinese authorities. Fortunately, several British weekly magazines have now expressed support for China and the League of Nations and demanded that the United Kingdom firmly intervene, even if it is to intervene alone. When Ambassador Guo spoke about the Manchurian issue, he only said that the meaning of the defense alliance was too ridiculous and not worth our comment. However, the conclusion of the alliance is enough to prove that Japan is challenging the entire world and disregarding the various international treaties that it has formally signed and agreed to abide by.</p>

<p>Havas, Geneva, 2nd: The work of the League of Nations has recently shown signs of stagnation. Most of the reason is that after the Disarmament Conference adjourned in early July, people from various countries went on summer vacation, so international institutions have become lonely. However, they will start activities again in September. The League of Nations Annual General Assembly should be convened on September 12 according to regulations, but this year it has been postponed to September 26. This meeting is probably not important. The meeting period can usually be extended for three or four weeks. This time, it will probably not exceed two weeks. However, if the report of the Lytton Investigation Team is discussed within this month, the situation will be different. According to the views of responsible experts, the report of the Investigation Team will be discussed when the League of Nations convenes a special general assembly. The special general assembly will not accept this matter until October or mid-month. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly convened on September 26 is just a meeting held according to regulations to handle routine matters. The 68th meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council will be held on September 22. Its chairman will probably be Irish Administrative Leader Fan Lera. Its meeting process is also not very important. However, changes in various international issues can also make the Administrative Council's affairs suddenly important. For example, Germany's negotiations for military equality, the conflict between Paraguay and Bolivia, and the results that the Stresha meeting can produce are all urgent matters today that can change. The main issues submitted to the Administrative Council for discussion are: (1) The termination of the British mandate to administer Iraq. (2) The report submitted by the Committee for the Study of Various International Public Works Problems. (3) The financial situation of Greece, etc.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 3rd: At last night's Steel Helmet Party congress of 15,000 people, members of the German Central Government and the Prussian State Government attended. It can be seen that Prime Minister von Papen is leaning towards the Steel Helmet Party. The abolished prince and his brothers went to the dock to visit, and the public treated them with royal etiquette. The members of the cabinet and many generals who participated in the European War were also warmly welcomed by the audience. Military personnel, led by General Magensen, and the leader of the Steel Helmet Party, Selt, gave speeches advocating the abolition of the Treaty of Versailles and the Weimar Constitution, the restoration of compulsory military service, and that the party system has failed and it is now time for the military to come forward.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Berlin, 2nd: Two thousand members of the extreme right-wing Steel Helmet Corps gathered in the capital today to hold their annual meeting, which will last until Sunday. At present, there are internal political disputes in Germany, and the opinions of the various right-wing parties are inconsistent after the general election of the National Assembly, especially between the National Socialist Party and the National People's Party. Therefore, this year's annual meeting is even more eye-catching. The importance of this meeting can be seen especially in the speech given by Deputy Leader Rosteburg at the welcome meeting for representatives of the press. Du announced directly that he supported the von Papen government, saying that the Steel Helmet Corps welcomed the realization of the President's cabinet, which would consolidate the President's power to deal with the weak and incompetent National Assembly. The Steel Helmet Corps firmly opposes any one party taking full control of the German government. Furthermore, the leader of the group, Selt, also gave a speech to the public in Berlin's largest auditorium tonight in the same tone. Negotiations between the National Socialist Party and the Catholic Center Party are still in progress. Today, it was announced in the official gazette that rumors outside the world that these negotiations have been settled are inconsistent with the facts, and no decision has been made so far. What can be said now is that the National Socialist Party and the Center Party are both determined to stabilize the internal political situation, which can only be achieved by following the Weimar Constitution and judging the National Assembly's political system. It is generally believed that after the Prussian Cabinet commuted the death sentences of the five National Socialist Party members sentenced to death by the Bitten Court, these negotiations will be relaxed.</p>

<p>United Press, Tokyo, 3rd: The Seiyukai Party is very dissatisfied with the Rice Law and Debt Restructuring Bill passed by the Upper House. At 4:30 p.m. today, the Seiyukai Party submitted a resolution to extend the parliamentary session again, which was passed by the Lower House. Hatoyama visited leaders in Akita, Shimada, and Yamaguchi to seek moderation, but to no avail. The government held an emergency cabinet meeting in the House at 5:00 p.m. and decided to postpone the session again for one day, and the meeting will continue tomorrow. At 9:30 p.m., ten members each from the Upper and Lower Houses were selected to hold a joint committee meeting to discuss the Upper House amendments.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 3rd: The Debt Restructuring Association Bill was entrusted to the Special Committee on Rice Law Amendments at yesterday's plenary session of the House of Peers. However, the issue of the rate of rice prices was not included in the deliberation of the bill. It is still doubtful whether it can be deliberated today. In particular, the establishment of a central treasury and the issuance of lottery tickets are very difficult. As a result, it is not known whether it will be shelved in the House of Peers due to incomplete deliberation.</p>

Because the ministers attended the House plenary session, it was adjourned and reopened at 1:00 p.m. Kudo Tetsuo (Minsei) took the stage to speak, saying that at a time when there is a voice to rectify the parliament, it is extremely strange that Ozaki Tenpu of the Seiyukai Party and others beat Kamiyama Maninosuke, and proposed a motion to punish Ozaki. There was a commotion in the Seiyukai seats. Kiyose Ichiro, representing the National League, said that direct action is barbaric action and should not be allowed for any reason, and expressed his support for the motion to punish. Ozaki Tenpu (Seiyukai) took the stage to clarify his actions. As a result of the vote, it was vetoed due to a minority.</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 2nd: The German Himalayan expedition, which departed from Munich in April to climb Nanga Parbat (one of the highest peaks in the world), failed to reach its goal and is now returning to Germany. Expedition member Bezito telegraphed his mother, saying that several of his companions were ill. According to previous news, three team members had pitched a tent at an altitude of 22,965 feet, intending to advance to the summit from there. The current telegram indicates that they failed, and the Himalayas have once again defeated human power. Nanga Parbat is 26,629 feet high and is the highest peak in India.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd: Gordon Now, president of the British Geographical Society, and White Luce, president of the Harpo Club, announced today that a British expedition to Mount Everest in the Himalayas will be held in early 1933. The Indian government has obtained the Dalai Lama's consent for this expedition. The expedition plan will be announced by the Everest Committee at that time. Mount Everest is the world's most famous peak, with a height of 29,141 feet. The expedition began in 1921. Since then, people have ventured out to explore in 1922, 1924, and 1925, but none of them were able to reach the summit directly. The two expeditions in 1922 and 1914 were personally guided by White Luce. In 1924, Britons Norton and Somerville pitched tents at an altitude of 26,800 feet and climbed to 28,200 feet the next day. In 1925, British explorers Mallory and Owen wanted to break the record and climb the last 1,000 feet, but they failed to achieve their ambition and lost their lives.</p>

<p>Magazine Society as a whole to comply with the record, has been for a long time, various newspapers and magazines, according to the law applied for reporters, are indeed numerous, but those who harbor intentions of watching and procrastinating are still not few, which greatly loses the earnest notification of this Ministry in handling news registration. At this time when the country is supporting the news industry and promoting freedom of speech, various news businesses are booming. Those with pure aims and upright arguments are indeed numerous, but it is difficult to guarantee that there will be none with radical views, reactionary propaganda, and intentions to incite social unrest. This Ministry's handling of this registration actually contains the intention of protection in the examination. The responsible publishers of these newspapers and magazines, if they hold fair views, should regard applying for registration as their natural duty. However, a small number of responsible publishers of newspapers and magazines are ignorant of this meaning, only knowing to covet rights, registering with the post office and establishing bonds, enjoying the special privilege of preferential mailing, and disregarding the procedures for applying for registration according to law. If this continues for a long time, not only will reactionary propaganda be impossible to curb, but it will also affect social security to a great extent, and it is urgent to cancel their special privilege of registration and bond establishment and deal with them according to law to emphasize the importance of decrees. In addition to consulting the Ministry of Communications to instruct the Directorate General of Posts to conduct a thorough investigation when newspapers and magazines apply for registration and bond establishment to determine whether they have been approved for registration by this Ministry, and to verify whether they have a registration certificate issued by this Ministry before allowing bond establishment and registration to show restriction and curb the emergence of disorder. For those who have already established bonds, if they still do not apply to the local provincial or municipal government for referral to this Ministry for examination, registration, and receipt of a registration certificate, their special privilege of bond establishment and registration will be revoked to prevent concealment. In addition to distributing the order, we hereby consult your municipal government to investigate and instruct the responsible publishers of the newspapers and magazines that have not yet registered to be informed, and we hope to receive a reply, etc. Upon receiving this, in addition to distributing the order and replying, we hereby issue the order to be followed. This order.</p>

<p>The Social Bureau Implements Inspection of Weights and Measures</p>
<p>Gold, Silver, Chinese Medicine, etc. are not exempt.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the new system of weights and measures in this city, the South City, Zhabei, and the French Concession have successively implemented inspections. However, besides vegetable markets, only 42 industries were inspected, and those with special circumstances, such as gold, silver, and medicinal materials, were not included. After the City Social Bureau forwarded this to the Ministry of Industry for instructions, it was ordered that the conversion of old weights and measures to the new system and the price conversion method in the original localities where the new system was implemented were to solve this difficulty. The gold and silver and Chinese medicine industries should, of course, abide by this. At the same time, the National Bureau of Weights and Measures, following the Ministry's order, stated that the reasons for the Nanjing Chinese Medicine Association's advocacy of using the new system were untenable, and the Chinese medicine industry should adopt the new system at the same time as other industries and should not shirk responsibility. The silver industry should follow the new weights and measures procedures and use the conversion method to implement the new system. The City Social Bureau believed that since Nanjing had already implemented the system, this city could no longer delay, and had already ordered the Weights and Measures Verification Institute to begin inspections on October 1. At the same time, it issued orders to the gold, silver, and Chinese medicine guilds, instructing all members to comply.</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Again Requests the Customs to Severely Punish Qiao Li</p>
<p>Marking Prices with Pen Scribbles, Careless Procedures</p>
<p>Detaining Completed Tax Payment Receipts, Coercing the People</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce formerly sent a letter from the Sugar Industry Association stating that Customs Inspector Qiao Li had detained the completed tax payment receipt of Guangyuan Sugar Firm and requested the Customs to withdraw the punishment. It is now learned that the Customs replied yesterday, stating that Guangyuan Firm had fabricated accusations with an arrogant attitude. Until the firm expresses its apologies, matters for negotiation will not be considered, etc. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the Customs' reply is unreasonable and has sent another letter of rebuttal, again requesting severe punishment for Qiao Li. The exchange of letters is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Customs Letter:</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, We have received your letter stating that the Shanghai Grain Industry Association claims that its member, Guangyuan, had a black market incident when the Jianghai Customs auctioned confiscated white sugar. It requests a thorough investigation, and the Chief of the General Affairs Section, Customs Inspector Qiao Li, became angry and refused to return the general receipt of the completed import tax payment, preventing the extraction and sale of the sugar. It requests that the payment be issued and that the tax official be punished. This office previously received a letter from Guangyuan Firm forwarded by the Sugar Industry Association, stating that Customs Inspector Qiao Li of the General Affairs Section did not open the bidding publicly for the Jianghai Customs auction of confiscated refined white sugar. Later, it was announced that Yuanji Firm won the bid, with signs of altering the bid price. It requested a thorough investigation to prevent malpractice. The Customs Inspector replied after reviewing the case in detail, believing that Guangyuan Firm was unfamiliar with the Customs' usual procedures and arbitrarily fabricated accusations, which should be absolutely denied. Moreover, its arrogant attitude and unscrupulous behavior should not be tolerated. The details of this case are presented to Your Superintendent. All bidding documents for this Customs auction of confiscated sugar were received by the Director of the Transportation Department and transferred to the Customs Inspector of the General Affairs Section for handling. Among the bidding documents received, there was one from Yuanji Firm. Before it was opened and read, the representative of Yuanji Firm came to the Customs to inquire whether the submitted bid document could be returned for correction. Since it was inconvenient to refuse this request from the merchant, it was approved. However, the Customs Inspector of the General Affairs Section and the Director of the Transportation Department naturally kept the bid prices of other merchants strictly confidential. How could there be any leakage to Yuanji Firm? Guangyuan Firm claimed that the Customs did not open the bidding publicly for the auction of the sugar, pointing out the discovery of a black market. However, it is not aware that this type of bidding document has never been opened publicly by this Customs. It is received and transferred by the Director of the Transportation Department to the Customs Inspector of the General Affairs Section for opening and deciding which merchant should purchase the auctioned goods. How could Guangyuan Firm jump to accuse it of a black market and start such a malicious accusation? The above situation is that the content of Guangyuan Firm's letter is unfounded and the wording is absurd. We propose that Your Superintendent verify and inform Guangyuan Firm that it should express its apologies to this Customs regarding this case. Before this is done, all matters related to this firm will be ignored. In addition to re-examining the Customs and handling the issuance of the general receipt mentioned earlier, we hereby reply for your information.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Reply:</p>
<p>We have received your letter stating that Customs Inspector Qiao Li believes that Guangyuan Sugar Firm's criticism of the Customs auction of confiscated white sugar is arrogant and that Guangyuan's affairs will be ignored until it expresses its apologies. When the Customs auctions confiscated items, even if a bidder requests to correct the bid price, it should formally apply in writing to have the original submitted bid document returned for revision to show seriousness. However, according to the information, the original bid price written in ink was crossed out, and another price was rewritten with an ink pen as a result of a face-to-face consultation. The handling procedures are inevitably careless. Although the Customs is a national agency, it handles public affairs. Whether the handling is appropriate or not should be subject to the supervision of higher authorities and the criticism of the public. This is a common practice in modern countries. The phrase "arrogant attitude and unscrupulous behavior" is an old trick of Qing officials to intimidate the people, but the Customs is also imitating it, which this Chamber of Commerce considers inappropriate. As for detaining the general receipt of the completed tax payment and declaring that subsequent negotiations will be ignored, officials serve under the commission of national laws and regulations, not a private contract with Guangyuan. It seems inappropriate to use this as a means of resistance. We request that your office correct this according to the law. If it is ineffective, we request that your office submit it directly to the Customs Administration for verification and handling, rather than allowing arbitrary oppression.</p>
<p>Anhui Provincial Government Decides to Issue Highway Bonds</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government replied to the Anhui Native Association's telegram stating: Shanghai Anhui Native Association, Greetings. Regarding the case in which your association's telegram requested exemption from issuing road construction bonds, we replied by telegram and ordered the Finance and Construction Departments to discuss and reply. Subsequently, the departments replied that road construction is essential for construction, developing transportation, increasing production, and is of great importance to the people's livelihood. Chairman Jiang had previously designated deadlines for the completion of each road, and recently, we received a telegram from Chairman Jiang relayed by your office, ordering that the transportation time between the most remote border counties of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and their provincial capitals should not exceed thirty-six hours, and that all must be completed by June 1 of next year, etc. The urgency of the need and the strictness of the decree make it necessary to expedite the work. However, with the provincial treasury in dire straits, it is difficult to raise large sums of money. Even designating rice tax fee revenue as a special fund for road construction is feared to be too slow to meet the need. Therefore, Director Cheng planned to issue 5 million yuan in highway bonds. When the proposal was submitted to your office, it underwent thorough review and discussion and considered the people's hardships, raising funds in installments without forced apportionment, without the suffering of doorstep demands. Moreover, the bonds designate rice tax fee revenue as a repayment fund and organize a fund management committee to ensure the credit of the bonds. The short repayment period and high interest rate far exceed those of various bonds in recent years. The public does not increase its burden, and the province's main roads can be completed in sequence in a short period of time, which is in line with the original telegram's purpose of clearing up finances. This bond ordinance is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Legislative Yuan for review. Once promulgated in the future, it will be understood by fellow countrymen abroad. As for the three items of financial clearance mentioned in the original telegram, (1) The tobacco seedling special donation was handled directly by the former Chairman Chen in the name of the Provincial Government, and the Finance Department has no record to check. (2) The Finance Department has repeatedly and strictly investigated and pursued the arrears of famous counties and various tax bureaus over the years, and is now ordering departments to clear each case to avoid long-term suspension of public funds. (3) The previous road construction bonds were issued in the 18th year of the Republic of China for 237,415 yuan. Last year, due to the flood, the budget was insufficient, and it was proposed to the former Provincial Government to continue sales. As of now, a total of 325,248 yuan has been issued, and an order has been issued to close the issue and order the remittance of all funds raised and no further fundraising, and to redeem the principal and interest according to the various items listed on the bond certificates to show credit. The reason for the former order is that it should be submitted to you for review and transferred to you so that you can understand the truth. In addition to issuing the order, we hereby telegram you for your information, Anhui Provincial Government.</p>

<p>Food Expenses Received Yesterday:</p>
<p>The eleventh installment of workers' food expenses, 840 yuan, originally scheduled to be issued on August 31, was repeatedly sought from the Nanjing Road business department by the Social Bureau together with representatives of the labor union, but was not received. At 11:00 AM yesterday, the Social Bureau sent Zhu Guilin again, together with labor union representatives Xia Zhongzhao and Gong Zishen, to collect it. They were met by executive directors Shen Jiucheng and Wang Xianhua. After repeated negotiations, it was finally issued in full and received by the labor union representatives.</p>
<p>Capital Side Declares Dissent:</p>
<p>After the arbitration committee's ruling, the Cotton Textile Industry Union of the Seventh District has published a statement to all sectors, reluctantly accepting the ruling. The reporter went to the company again yesterday to inquire and learned that the capital side believes that it is practically impossible to restore a portion within three months and accommodate one-fifth of the workers while laying off the rest according to the contract, and has decided to declare dissent within days and prepare to file an appeal. If four-fifths of the workers are laid off according to the ruling, according to the labor-capital conditions of the San You Industrial Society determined by the Shanghai Municipal Mediation Committee in March of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the severance pay should be calculated according to the length of service, with one month's pay for each full year and half a month's pay for each year since the 11th year of the Republic of China. The total amount of severance pay to be issued is approximately 300,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Xu Chongdao General Branch Store Employees to Resume Work Tomorrow by Order of the Social Bureau</p>
<p>After the strike of the employees of the Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store General Branch, party and government agencies sent personnel to convene questioning and persuaded the employees to resume work first, which was ineffective. After consultation, a decision was made on how to handle the matter. The Social Bureau ordered both labor and capital sides to ensure that all employees resume work by 5:00 PM on the 5th, and the wages during the strike will be deducted. The handling process will also be reported to the municipal government.</p>
<p>Social Bureau Order</p>
<p>The Social Bureau yesterday instructed the Pharmaceutical Industry Workers Union, saying: "Regarding the matter of the Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store General Manager Cen Zhiliang's report that the entire staff of the general branch store coerced and illegally went on strike, disrupting business, and requesting investigation and handling. According to this, the cause of this dispute is Qu Ming's false accusation against Chen Peiran. Whether Chen Peiran stole something or not can be proven by the facts, and whether Qu Ming made a false accusation can be reported by Chen Peiran according to law. However, the entire staff of the store went on strike to coerce without following legal procedures, disregarding the capital side's business and social peace. Such rash action by the labor union is inappropriate. In addition to instructing the manager, all staff of the general branch store must resume work by 5:00 PM on September 5, without fail. Any violation will be investigated. The capital side is allowed to deduct the wages of the employees during the strike to show a slight punishment. Please be informed of this order."</p>
<p>Deadline for Resumption of Work</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau yesterday issued a reply to the Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store, saying: "We have received your report. The only reason for the labor side's actions yesterday was the false accusation of theft, which falls within the scope of the judiciary. The staff did not follow the legal procedures and went on strike to coerce, which is inappropriate. In addition to ordering the staff to return to work by 5:00 PM on September 5, you must also notify each branch store to resume business on that day. The wages of the employees during the strike will be deducted to show a slight punishment. Please comply with this order."</p>
<p>Direct Negotiation</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reported that yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, labor representatives Feng Xingzhang and Xu Chongdao's ten group representatives Cen Yongkang and Sun Zhengkui went to the general branch to negotiate directly with the store owner Xu Zixun. The labor side proposed that Qu Ming's position must be dismissed first, and then all other matters can be discussed. The store said that since this case has been reported to the party and government agencies, it will comply with all orders from the party and government and set a new plan. The store did not accept the labor side's demands, resulting in no resolution.</p>
<p>Employees' Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the strike committee convened a general meeting to discuss countermeasures and passed the following resolutions: (1) If the capital side's attitude is so tough, rejecting all persuasion and leaving no room for mediation, how should we respond? It was resolved to request assistance from higher-level unions and fellow workers in the same industry. (2) Should we appeal to the party and government agencies if the capital side is so tough? It was resolved to petition the party and government agencies on the 5th of this month. (3) Should representatives be sent to negotiate with the capital side? It was resolved to send Ji and other three comrades to negotiate with the capital side. (4) (Confidential). (5) The small groups and district branches of the Cunren Qingyu Tang Huang Jiuzhi and other stores previously expressed condolences and provided financial assistance. Should we express our gratitude? It was resolved to express gratitude after the dispute is resolved. (Omitted).</p>
<p>The Social Bureau Formally Mediates Labor-Capital Conditions in the Brewing Industry Yesterday</p>
<p>Decision to Use Brewing Costs as the Standard for Handling</p>
<p>Orders Both Sides to Submit Reports Within One Week for Review</p>
<p>Brewery workers in this city, in view of the rising cost of living and the insufficient wages to maintain their livelihoods, the union decided to request improved treatment at a general meeting. The Social Bureau formally mediated yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation Process</p>
<p>The Social Bureau convened representatives from both labor and capital yesterday morning at 10:00 AM for formal mediation. Labor representatives Wang Bingkui and Shen Guomin, capital representatives Zhu Qingtang and Fang Zhongheng, and Municipal Party Department's Yu Zhongbiao were present, presided over by Social Bureau mediator Wang Gang. The capital side stated the brewing costs and business conditions, saying they were unable to afford wage increases. The labor side stated that the costs reported by the capital side were too high and unreliable and that, based on their current business conditions, they could afford wage increases. Representatives from the party and government agencies then consulted and decided to use brewing costs as the standard for increasing wages, ordering both labor and capital sides to open their income and expenditure accounts and submit them to the bureau for review within one week.</p>
<p>Summary of Conditions</p>
<p>The Brewing Industry Workers Union proposed a total of eighteen conditions for improved treatment, which are summarized below:</p>
<p>Article 4: Wages should be increased by 2 yuan per month for each person based on existing wages, double pay in December, and double monthly bonus.</p>
<p>Article 8: At the end of each year, workshops should provide travel expenses of 6 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Article 9: Workers' work in large breweries should not exceed 200 dan of rice per person per year, and small breweries should not exceed 150 dan of rice. Still bottoms should not exceed 100 dan for small breweries.</p>
<p>Article 14: Each year's profit should be divided between workers and workshop owners at a ratio of 3:7, with the distribution method based on the workers' salary ratio.</p>
<p>Article 17: The burden of loading and unloading still bottoms should be increased by 1.5 cents per dan, and the burden of collecting bottles should be increased by 3 cents per dan.</p>
<p>Workers of the Shanghai-South Public Bus Company Petitioned Party and Government Agencies Yesterday</p>
<p>Company's Back Pay Already Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Shanghai-South Public Bus Company on Xiexu Road closed down, all workers were impoverished, and the company's back pay had not been issued. Yesterday morning, they petitioned the party and government agencies to demand the resumption of business. The company's back pay was issued at 5:30 AM. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Petition Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, all the workers (except for a portion left to guard the factory) marched in the pouring rain to petition the party and government agencies, shouting slogans along the way. They first went to the Municipal Party Department on Linyin Road, where they were received by Zhou Lianze, a cadre from the civil training section. Workers' representatives Zhou Anshan, Tao Baoyu Han Shunhao, and Pan Qiuyuan stated the reasons for the petition and submitted their demands. The municipal representative accepted and relayed them. Later, Secretary-General Jiang Huaisu personally replied to the workers' representatives, saying that the back pay would be ordered to be issued by the company on the same day, and the party and government agencies would mediate the demands for resumption of business within the shortest possible time. The workers' representatives expressed satisfaction and then marched to the Social Bureau in Xiaonanmen to petition, requesting to see Section Chief Xu of the Third Section. As Section Chief Xu had urgently summoned the liquidator Jiang Wanping accountant entrusted by the company to the bureau to fulfill the payment of back pay, Peng Zhenqiu was sent to receive them. At the same time, the petitioning workers surrounded Jiang Wanping's car. After persuasion from the bureau, which agreed to proceed with the mediation of the demands, the workers felt satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>Preliminary Measures</p>
<p>When the workers petitioned, the Social Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, and representatives of the workers Zhou Anshan, Tao Baoyu, Pan Qiuyuan, and the company's liquidator Jiang Wanping accountant jointly decided on three preliminary measures: (1) The company's back pay should be issued, and the workers' advances should be deducted. If the advance has exceeded or is equal to the amount of back pay, the party and government representatives will be responsible for borrowing from the company to maintain the workers' livelihood. (2) The uniforms and badges will be kept by the workers until the company resumes business, but they must not be worn at ordinary times. (3) After the company clears the back pay, all workers will leave the factory on the same day.</p>
<p>Back Pay Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>The company, party and government agency representatives, and labor and capital representatives decided to issue the back pay on the 31st at a meeting on the 30th. The dispute over the return of badges and uniforms caused repeated delays. The back pay was issued yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM by company representative Cheng Zemin accountant Jiang Wanping, together with worker representatives Qian Shunhao and Yin Changgen, in the company. Party and government agencies also sent representatives to supervise the process.</p>

<h3 id="e86">"Renwen" Monthly, Volume 3, Issue 5 Published <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The "Renwen" monthly, specially compiled to publish modern historical materials and serve as a reference for scholars, has released Volume 3, Issue 5. In terms of text, this issue features "Gengzi Chuanxin Lu" by Xiyin Jun, originally written by Li Yiyuan of Hunan province. As an experienced person with an unbiased perspective, his record of events from the beginning of the disaster to the Western Hunt is vividly portrayed. Due to the taboos of the time, the original text was published once under a pseudonym with a preface by a foreigner, but it was not widely seen. Xiyin Jun has searched for many years and finally obtained a manuscript, which is published in this issue. Those who want to understand the truth about the Boxer Rebellion and diplomatic relations between China and foreign countries at the end of the Qing dynasty should not miss it. "The Decline and Relief of Chinese Farmers' Economy" by Du Sumin details the causes of the collapse of the Chinese farmers' economy and methods of remedy. "Gu Hongmei Zhuotong Ji" by Jiangdong Adou contains a section on the special economic examination held at the end of the Qing dynasty, which is quite valuable. "The Relationship between Ancient China and the World" by Liao Shigong continues from the previous issue. "Reading Notes" by Wen Yu introduces "An Outline of Educational Philosophy." The magazine index attached at the end is particularly rich in content. In addition to the Renwen Editorial Office located at Nanchangjiatang Lane on Lafayette Road in Shanghai, it is also sold at the Living Weekly Society, Xinyue, Nanxin, Xiandai, Zou Dong, Dadong, Xiaoxing, and major bookstores in other cities.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Another Child Abduction Case Cracked While Searching for a Missing Child <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Xu Wangao, residing at No. 94, Changle Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, had his four-year-old son, Changgui, suddenly abducted the day before yesterday. Xu immediately searched by knocking on the cover of a foot stove. Unexpectedly, Dai Jinkang, who lives in Bangnan, also came for the same reason. After talking to each other, they learned that Dai had also lost his five-year-old son, Youzhong. They sympathized with each other and sought legal assistance. Xia Runu, who lives in Changle Lane, often had children coming and going to his house, so they suspected him. They tracked Xia all day, and Xia's behavior was suspicious. Dai asked him, but Xia changed his surname to Zhang. Therefore, Xu and Dai considered it very suspicious and immediately took him to the police station. They went to Xia's house to search and took Xia, his wife Chen, and Wang Hanzhi, who lived with them, and a three-year-old girl, Gongliaotou, to the police station. Although the police officers did not find any trace of Xu and Dai's children, they questioned where Gongliaotou came from. According to Xia, he brought her from Zhenjiang and was now entrusting Wang to sell her. However, he firmly denied anything to do with Xu and Dai's sons. Although the case was unclear, the police station inadvertently cracked another case. They immediately sent the case to the local court for trial.</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Main Reason Why Native Cloth Cannot Sell Well <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Textiles are mixed with flying cotton, which is not durable.</p>
<p>The Director of the Agricultural Education Center requests a strict ban.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, the Director of the Zhuanqiao Farmers' Education Center in the Third Public Education District of Shanghai County, submitted a petition to the County Education Bureau yesterday, requesting that it be forwarded to the County Government for the issuance of a notice to strictly ban flying cotton in order to protect the sale of native cloth and alleviate the people's difficulties. The original petition is excerpted as follows: (Omitted above) The cloth produced in the Puxi area of our county has always been famous. In the past five years, the sale of native cloth has become increasingly sluggish. There are many reasons for this, but the addition of flying cotton, which makes the cloth loose and not durable, is one of the main reasons. Flying cotton is the scattered fiber in yarn factories that accumulates on the ground. It is put into the machine to make it loose, mixed with stone powder, and baked with sulfur. It is white and solidified. It can be used as floss when fluffed and as bedding when rubbed. It can still be spun into yarn and woven into cloth, but the yarn has many fragments and is of poor quality. Moreover, it contains lime and sulfur, and the color of the cloth changes over time. Even a slight touch causes dust to fly, which is harmful to hygiene. Initially, flying cotton was only popular in Caoxing in our county, but now it is popular everywhere. Flying cotton is only mixed into dark-colored cloth, but now it is mixed into all kinds of cloth. At a time when strong neighbors are invading and the people's livelihood is declining, it is appropriate to promote local products to strengthen the people's power and compete with imported goods. Now, the addition of flying cotton destroys credit and is a way of self-destruction. Weaving women are ignorant and cannot be blamed. Merchants disregard the overall situation and are deeply hateful. If it is not strictly prohibited, how can we promote local products and save the people's livelihood? For this reason, I respectfully request the Director to review the situation and forward it to the County Government for the issuance of a notice to strictly ban the sale of flying cotton and maintain the people's livelihood. The County Education Bureau has forwarded the petition to the County Government and requested the issuance of a notice to strictly prohibit the sale.</p>

<p>Guowen Agency reports that Ankang Lane on Gongping Road, Hongkou, which is managed by Younigan, aroused resentment among the tenants for ignoring the exemption of rent after the war. The tenants organized a tenants' union and refused to pay rent uniformly. Recently, the Younigan management entrusted Hua Guodong and others to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, demanding that the outstanding rent be paid within a time limit, and applying for provisional attachment and eviction. After the tenants of the lane sent a letter to the Citizens' Federation for assistance, the Federation dispatched executive committee member Zhou Fuzhang and lawyer Yu Hualong to negotiate with the representative of the management several times. Fortunately, Mr. Hua made concessions and empathized with the tenants' difficulties, agreeing to exempt rent for three months and defer the old rent for two to three months. The agreement was signed by both parties at Yu Hualong's law office the day before yesterday.</p>

Therefore, I have rarely shown my paintings to others. Now, feeling the urgency of the national crisis and grieving the plight of our compatriots in the Northeast, I am holding a solo exhibition of national crisis paintings. There are a total of 300 paintings of various sizes, including landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and animals. Starting today, I am reducing the prices and issuing 300 lottery tickets. For every ten yuan, I expect to collect 3,000 yuan. The exhibition's printing costs, advertising expenses, as well as the costs of painting paper, pigments, mounting, etc., are limited to 1,000 yuan. The remaining amount will be donated to the Northeast Refugee Relief Association to help our compatriots in distress. The lottery tickets will be sold out as soon as possible in order to raise funds for relief as soon as possible. The opening date is tentatively set for the end of November at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road."</p>

<p>丨Dancer Zheng Xiaoxu, a Wealthy Man丨</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>A friend of a friend died half a month ago. His death was caused by contracting "cholera" after exhausting his resistance in a dance hall. It is said that as he was dying, he shed tears and said in his weakest voice, "I regret that I did not go to the battlefield and fight the enemy to the death!"</p>
<p>"A man's words are good when he is about to die." Is it possible to teach him to shoulder a gun and go to the battlefield in an era intoxicated with Waltz and Foxtrot?</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Zheng Xiaoxu, who received favors from the enemy, is humming poetry. His poem says: "The lonely plant faces the sun and never flatters, the broken stream flows to the sea and never returns." Perhaps he also knows that the future is destined to be illusory, so the heroic spirit of "taking the stage in official robes" has already subsided like this. Old Zheng need not grieve. A true man says a bold saying, "I will be a good man again in eighteen years!" Old Zheng, prepare yourself.</p>
<p>When a person is full of pride, he will never think of the saying "fate will decline."</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>When a certain village was occupied by enemy troops, a wealthy man in the village who owned "Western-style houses and property" signed a contract with the enemy that unilaterally benefited the enemy. This contract has now been obtained by a traitor's wife from the enemy and sued in court on the grounds of "suspicion of colluding with the enemy." Some people say that the wealthy man's collusion with the enemy is not a fact, but that he signed the contract to protect his "Western-style houses and property" is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>The wealthy man was finally controlled by a traitor because of a contract. He did it for "Western-style houses and property."</p>

<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Houses come supported from foreign lands, music must be listened to every moment. I live on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Therefore, after the sudden invasion of the mainland by the Japanese, our whole family moved to Shanghai to take refuge. It was at this time that I became a teacher in someone's house. The house was newly built and was indeed thoroughly Westernized. Moreover, the houses in the surrounding area all belonged to the same owner. The construction is perfectly suited to the new era. Every day when I come and go here, I always feel that Shanghai does have a new atmosphere, closely following Europe and the United States. Who says we are lagging behind? However, after careful investigation and questioning, I learned that these many new-era houses, from the roof to the foundation, as well as the doors, windows, and small screws, are all products of American factories and shipped to China. There is a common saying: "A house cannot be carried away." This saying is also outdated, because the newly built houses in Shanghai that have some new-era characteristics are probably all supported from foreign countries. If domestically produced construction materials are used, they will definitely still be old-fashioned. The hostess of this house is very busy from morning to night. I don't study what she is busy with, but I feel that she is either going out or has guests at home. A frequent female guest is very young and gradually became familiar with me. Of course, she is the young mistress of a wealthy family. Every time I hear the sound of a car horn on the road, with the tune of "La-sha-mi-sha," I know it must be her coming. This kind of horn with musical sound is probably not very popular in the upper class yet. The most distinctive thing is that this female guest's house is equipped with the most fashionable wireless telephone. She often listens to it at home, and it is still not enough. She specially installed a wireless telephone in her car so that she can listen to it anytime and anywhere. It is said that it is especially interesting to listen to the wireless telephone while driving on a deserted road on summer nights. This lady can be said to be a lover of music.</p>
<h3 id="e117">After Visiting Liu Shi's Art Exhibition <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Tuo</p>
<p>丨Thinking of Three Inevitable Processes丨</p>
<p>Not only Liu Shi's paintings, but any successful paintings by anyone, three processes are inevitable for everyone. The first is the learning period, the second is the wandering period, and the third is the creative period. Whether it is the pursuit of the ancient or the imitation of modern people, it belongs to the universal phenomenon of the first period. This phenomenon is also very commonly reflected in the modern Chinese art world. As for the wandering period, it is the inevitable result of the problem of choosing and abandoning the methods and preferences. Because in this period, he has had considerable training in the cultivation of skills, and he also has a considerable understanding of the strengths of previous generations of writers, but the question of how to express himself on the canvas has become the biggest difficulty at present. In addition, the various writers who have become famous in the same era, each relying on their own images, have transformed into a variety of forms on their works and are constantly tempting him. At this time, the facial features of the ancients and the techniques of modern people make him only wander in the maze. However, the biggest and most important problem in painting is creation, otherwise it is not successful painting. Looking back at the domestic writers who are trapped on the other side of success, learners account for 50%, wanderers account for 30-40%, and creators/successful ones only account for 10-20%. Liu Shi's recent paintings certainly cannot be said to have reached an extremely mature creative period, but his recent paintings since returning from Putuo, although they still cannot get rid of the influence of the Western European art world in terms of expression, considering the rapid changes in Liu Shi's recent paintings and the fact that Liu Shi is still in his early youth in terms of age, the budding of his creation has indeed given us reliable evidence of comfort.</p>
<p>(Ping's Postscript): After appreciating Liu Shi's painting exhibition yesterday, I was exceptionally excited. It is truly amazing and enviable that a young man like him, who is only in his early twenties, can produce such beautiful Western-style paintings! Among his 145 masterpieces, whether it is a jungle, a wilderness, a quiet water village, a vast seashore, or the face of a girl, a bouquet of beautiful flowers, all are written fluently and vividly under his pen. Especially the several quick sketches of the Shanghai War depict soldiers fighting in the midst of artillery fire, calmly responding to the battle, risking their lives, and showing admirable bravery. There are also the traces of the Shanghai War, a scene of dilapidated ruins, which makes me deeply aware of the misery of exile and gives me a deeper impression of grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Judging from Liu Shi's recent style, he has the charm of the French painter Utrillo. With his talent, it will not be difficult to follow in his footsteps in the future. According to Mr. Hai Su, he will take Shi to Europe for study during the Sino-German Art Exhibition next year. I hope Mr. Shi will not be "a frog in a well," continue to work hard, and strive for greater success.</p>

<p>He also came to direct us himself, telling us not to shoot, not to fire artillery, but to wait for the enemy to get close and fight them hand-to-hand, throwing grenades, and we would definitely win the final victory. Our brothers all trusted and obeyed the commander's words, so we did as he ordered. Ah! How terrible! I saw with my own eyes that our brothers, 200 meters away from us, were buried alive in the ground by the enemy's bombs and artillery fire; I saw with my own eyes that our brothers were brutally killed by the enemy's charge; I also personally heard the last shrill groans of our brothers before they died. But our Regiment Commander Yuan repeatedly warned us that we must die, die on the enemy's bayonet, to be glorious. The battle line is so long, and the deployment of troops is very difficult. We will all defend for another day or two, and a large number of reinforcements can arrive. This small town must not be lost. It is extremely important strategically. Because it is important, we cannot deploy many heavy troops to avoid attracting the enemy's attention. Be brave, and I will die with you brothers in this town. It is very glorious! We listened to his words, so we were even more fearless of death. Once, the enemy charged over and more than 200 were killed by our machine guns; another time, the regimental commander came to direct us in person, ordering three or four soldiers to run back and forth in the trenches in front, firing rifles at the enemy. The enemy thought that there were many troops in the trenches and fired heavy artillery, firing for a full hour and a half, blasting the entire trench to the ground. But we stopped all sounds and stopped firing. The enemy thought that our brothers had all died, so he first sent a few people to probe, firing a few shots, and then a large number of troops came. We waited for them to get close and threw grenades and fired machine guns. The enemy was caught off guard and retreated in a hurry, but many had already died.</p>
<p>"Since the house of Second Sister Yu collapsed, the army has forbidden me to cook anymore. They send me some dry food to eat every day." "I have repeatedly wanted to see Regiment Commander Yuan, but I have never had the opportunity. I heard that once, he personally threw a bomb and killed an enemy captain and a bugler. He also captured an enemy flag."</p>
<p>"Think about it! How brave this Regiment Commander Yuan is! Think about it! How imposing is someone named Yu! His surname is Yuan, and my surname is also Yuan. He is my husband! How can you only hide in dog holes to escape?": : : She became crazy again, and no one paid any attention to her anymore; but there were also several young women who were fantasizing that it would be very meaningful and fortunate and glorious to kiss this Regiment Commander Yuan once.</p>

<p>— Father</p>
<p>The national situation is becoming increasingly urgent, and the domestic turmoil is also increasing! The valiant warriors, with guns and bullets, inevitably want to start some wars to play around. The diligent students, without fists or courage, rely only on their sharp tongues and continue to stir up trouble. Of course, I am only referring to the facts, and I have not, nor dare I, make a detailed judgment on their rights and wrongs, but at least this causes more disturbances, which is an undeniable thing. And especially the most sensational and influential is the turmoil at Chungking University this time. As a result, the highest institution of learning in the country was turned into a "mass exodus," which made me unable to help but recall an interesting story from 30 years ago. Zhang Wendagong Baixi founded a university and held a grand banquet for the faculty and staff before the school started. In the midst of the drunken revelry, he said to everyone, "This is our first time running a school. There will be many difficulties. If we run it well, it will be 'thanks to all of you.' If we don't run it well, we will have to ask 'all of you to leave!'" Unexpectedly, in the current educational circles after decades of running schools, there would still be such a "leaving" turmoil. Then how can we blame the "thankful" officials who first founded the schools for naturally being unable to avoid the blame of "leaving."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Fluctuations in Gold Market Continue to Strengthen <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Another Small Drop of Two Taels and Seven Mace Yesterday's gold market still fluctuated greatly, actually affected by the rise and fall of exchange rates and the volume of buying and selling. In the end, it fell by two taels and seven mace. It opened with a drop. Although the silver market shrank, the exchange rate recovered, mainly because the situation outside the customs was serious. Afterwards, it went from firm to weak and once broke the 700 tael mark. Finally, it seemed to turn to peace. It is heard that a certain bank continues to absorb spot goods, totaling 210 bars, sold by Dadecheng. However, Yingfengheng sold to spot and entered the forward market. The after-market was no market.</p>
<p>The ups and downs of the half-day market. The market opened in October at 701 taels and 8 mace, a drop of 2 taels and 1 mace. The silver price is not unaffected by the current situation. Yuhe and others sold out first, and then it fell to 005 mace. Soon, Fuxingyong and others came in, and it was heard that the central government bought 105 bars of spot goods, so it rose by two or three taels, reaching 03 taels and 3 mace at 9:15. Soon, Hengyuyuan and Tai and others sold out. It was also learned that HSBC's listed price may be lengthened, so it fell sharply by two taels and seven or eight mace. When the British gold was announced to be lengthened by 125 and the US dollar by 25, the domestic market was still flat, so it did not fall. At that time, it was 02 taels and 5 mace. Zhaofengchang and others bought in and added two taels, reaching 04 taels and 5 mace at 9:45. Afterwards, it hovered around 700 taels, but the trend was weak. Zhenchangxiang and others sold out, and most of the buyers were retail customers and those who covered their heads with goods. Until after 10:30, it felt even more exhausted, breaking 700 taels, because the exchange rate suddenly became loose and rampant. All numbers followed suit and sold out, and because the December British gold was actually 19.875 and the October US dollar was 31.5 yuan, everyone could get in and out. Soon, the December 875 was difficult to get rid of, so at 10:30, it was finally 698 taels and 7 mace. Not long after, it rebounded again. Yuanmaoyong Yuankangxiang and others came to compete to buy, and Zhaofengchang made up the short position, so the price jumped more than four taels, but the plate was only a few cents, not even one tael. At 11:20, it was 03 taels and 2 mace. However, Bingxing Yuanheng Hengyu sold out. HSBC came out with the November US dollar at 6875, and it should be reduced to 01 silver and 2 mace. After 11:45, it added another tael. At this time, the Dalian gang dragged in. At noon, the market closed at 01 taels and 2 mace, a further drop of 2 taels and 7 mace compared to the previous day. According to the half-day, the largest was 04 taels and 5 mace, and the smallest was 98 taels and 7 mace, a difference of 5 taels and 8 mace. The bare strips added 9 taels and a half. The opening price was changed to 777 taels, a squeeze of 74 or 5 taels, then 72 taels, and then 79 taels. The market closed at 76 taels, a decrease of 4 taels compared to the previous day. The registration and water replenishment were the same as 01 taels.</p>
<p>The entries and exits of various numbers are different, and the transactions on the surface are not small. However, the receipts and payments are quite chaotic. According to statistics, Zhifengyong, Zhaofengchang, and Shunli all entered, and Hengyu and Fuyu's receipts and payments were complicated. Zhenchangxiang, Tongtaichang, and others all sold out, and the other numbers were complicated. According to the investigation, the Dalian gang totaled more than 800 bars, which roughly evened out. The Guangdong gang bought more than 600 and sold more than 300. The total amount of bars for each number was about 24,000 within the past day.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Foreign Exchange Rises in Both Open and Hidden Markets <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the silver market fell, the exchange rate rose. However, the local market situation went against the trend. HSBC's listed price increased by half a block, with British gold rising by 125, US dollar by 25, Indian and German exchange rates by 75 each, Japanese yen plus half a shield, French franc by 6 yuan, and Singapore dollar by a small 75. Hong Kong remained unchanged. As for the domestic market, it was flat at first and then loosened, and there was a fluctuation. As a result, it was flat. Compared with the previous day, the British and American exchange rates each increased by 0625, which was indeed affected by the continued downward trend of the gold market due to the instability of the current situation. The receipts and payments of various banks were quite a lot. It is estimated that the British gold was about 100,000 pounds. British and Japanese banks mutually received and paid, and the gold gang first sold and then bought. The total amount of US dollars was about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Most of the gold numbers were thrown out, and some were redeemed with return slips. There were many transactions between the various banks, and Datong sold short positions and Zhengjin bought stomach, which was still good. Because the market will be closed on Saturday, the British exchange rate fluctuated by 125 in the domestic market for half a day. The early selling price was about 1 shilling, 9 pence, 5625 to 75, the buying price was 625 to 8125, and the noon closing selling price was 625 to 8125, and the buying price was 6875 to 875.</p>
<p>The US exchange rate fluctuated by 1875 in the domestic market for half a day. The early selling price was 31.25 yuan in September, 375 in October, half a yuan in November, and 625 in December. The buying price was 375 to 75, and the spread between this month and December was 375. The noon closing was similar to the early opening, and the listed price was 1 yuan, which was equivalent to 3 taels, 2 mace, 3 fen, 886.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Large Bars Rebound by 1875 <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from National News Agency in London on the 3rd: The closing price of large bars rebounded, with the near term at 18 pence, 4375, and the far term at 18 pence, 5625, each up 3/16 compared to the previous day. Also, the exchange rate between London and New York opened at 3 yuan, 4 jiao, 7 fen, 25.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Silver Dollar Market Sales Stagnant and Weak <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, because it was Saturday and the banks had their usual afternoon holiday, the demand for silver dollars was relatively lax. Moreover, due to the current situation, the sales of commercial goods had been active for a while, but in the past day or two, they had become stagnant again. Because people are panic-stricken, even if it is just hearsay, they have to prepare for a rainy day. Therefore, the wholesale firms, after being prosperous, felt desolate again. Thus, the use of silver dollars became bleak again.</p>
<p>The interest rate fluctuated very slightly, and the "yuan interest" was the same as the "yang interest." The early market interest rate was 8 hao, 7 hu, and half less than the previous noon, at 6 qian, 9 fen. The noon market was 1 hao and 2 hu and a half higher, at 6 qian, 9 fen, and 1 hao and 2 hu and a half. As a result, the difference between the two markets was slightly less than 7 hao and a half compared to the previous noon. Fortunately, the content was still healthy, and there should be no major drop. The "silver interest" for both the morning and noon markets was 8 fen, which was 2 fen less than the previous day. The head-cutting and water addition was about 1 qian, and the silver supply was moderately tight.</p>
<p>The Guangdong small coin did not move, and the copper coin slightly shrunk. The early market for Jiangnan small foreign coins was still 3 li less, at 5 qian, 9 fen, and 5 li. The noon market rebounded by 3 li, at 5 qian, 9 fen, and 8 li. As a result, it was still the same as the previous noon. The trading volume in the early market was 2,000 jiao, and the trading volume in the noon market was 3,500 qian. The Guangdong small foreign coins were the same in both markets, at 5 qian, 8 fen, 4 li, and 7 hao and a half. The trading volume in the early market was 50,000 jiao, and the trading volume in the noon market was 20,000 jiao. The copper coin rebounded by a short 500 wen, at 433,000 wen.</p>
<p>The entries and exits of silver dollars were mostly simple. Due to the banks' holiday in the afternoon yesterday, many of the various types of receipts and disbursements were not able to be processed in time, so the amount was limited. The receipts and disbursements of Chinese merchants' bills were 1.67 million to 1.7 million, the receipts and disbursements of foreign merchants' bills were 1.3 million to 1.4 million, the receipts and disbursements of various goods, exchange taxes, and miscellaneous items were 6.8 million to 6.9 million, the pawn transactions were more than 900,000, the warehouse entry was 400,000, the warehouse exit was 300,000, the receipts and disbursements of money houses and banks were more than 27 million, the head-cutting receipts and disbursements were more than 3.6 million, and the receipts and disbursements of various remittance routes were more than 500,000. The receipts and disbursements of cash were Qianzhi. The "foreign receipts" remittance bills were 700,500 in the morning market and 75,000 in the noon market. The checks were 35,000 in the morning market and 90,000 in the noon market. The bank transactions were 650,000 in the morning market and 450,000 in the noon market. The receipts and disbursements of foreign accounts of various banks were more than 1.7 million, the entries and exits of banknotes were about 2 million, the foreign pawn transactions were more than 600,000, the small money house transactions were 400,000, the receipts and disbursements of money house foreign public bills were more than 5.7 million, the receipts and disbursements of foreign head-cutting bills were more than 1.7 million, and the borrowing and lending of foreign money was more than 1.4 million.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Securities Are All Up, but Spot Goods Alone Fall by One Yuan <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 3rd), the market conditions of various bonds in the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. The spot goods made open cuts in the military, 20 volumes, and 6 others, totaling 9,000 yuan. The futures trading was still scarce. There was no market in October, and the popularity was very depressed. It is estimated that the morning trading was still 1.1 million yuan, and the after-market was less than 800,000 yuan, of which only the salt tax accounted for 660,000 yuan. The military downsizing and unified tax continued to be scarce, and others were even more rare. Because the surrounding environment has not seen new changes, large households are waiting and watching, the market is quiet, and the supply and demand situation is very balanced, so various accumulated securities are still trapped in a hovering state without major ups and downs. It is estimated that the whole day only fluctuates by one or two corners, and the rise and fall are only a few corners compared to the previous day. The whole six dividends are one yuan less than the end of last month. The sluggish situation of the bond market is no different from before.

<p>The cotton yarn market rose in the morning and weakened in the afternoon, but the overseas yarn market trended upward. Rongxinghao bought a large amount of additional codes, and the general retail investors sold because there were many rumors in Shanghai and the actual demand was not smooth. In short, the overall situation is still stable. Although the situation is chaotic, the factory stockpiles are thin, and the yarn prices in Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places in the mainland are higher than in Shanghai. This is because the boycott of enemy goods is enthusiastic, and the local yarn is not enough to supply.</p>
<p>The bidding rises slightly, and the bidding in the front market opened. American cotton rose sharply, and retail investors made up for it. A certain country's yarn rose sharply by 10 yuan, and each month rose by one or two taels and seven or eight qian to two taels. However, the Changsha gang sold out. In the afternoon, the popularity in the market weakened again, rumors were rampant again, and each month fell by 3.7.8 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 35,250 bales. According to the investigation, Suilong sold 1,200 bales, Yichang 5,000 bales, Huachang 1,200 bales, Xincheng 1,400 bales, Ruidai 2,050 bales, and Shenji 900 bales.

<p>American cotton has turned to an upward trend again, and the situation is smart. Because Wall Street is powerful and the harvest is not good, the market plate suddenly rose. The local cotton market followed suit, and a certain manufacturer absorbed a large amount of cotton in October. The general short sellers had to cut their positions in pain, but most of them were psychologically small because the domestic harvest was still good. However, according to the world cotton market, it is extremely firm. If American cotton does not change, local cotton may still reach a peak.</p>
<p>Zheng Bidding's Short Covering Zheng Bidding opened in the front market, rising with foreign cotton. A certain country's flower rose by 2.3 yuan, and the short positions were covered. The situation was tight again, and each month rose by 6.7 qian. In the afternoon, due to the weakness of the yarn market, each month fell by 5 fen to 1 qian and a half. The total transaction volume for the day was 100,700 dan. According to the investigation, Suilong sold 3,800 dan, Tongxing 4,400 dan, Yichang 3,100 dan, Xincheng 3,000 dan, Yuanda 3,200 dan, Changhe 3,300 dan, Yuchang 5,000 dan, and Yifeng 2,400 dan.

<p>But the new cotton production situation is relatively poor.</p>
<p>The market shows a strong bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>New York, September 2nd, reports on the cotton market situation for the week: Cotton prices rose this week, more than four points higher than the low prices of this cotton season. As the upward trend started, bulls closed out positions, shorts covered positions, and sellers in the South also increased their selling. Sales in the South are not yet strong, but it is expected that sales will increase as new cotton is harvested everywhere. There is a tendency for distant contracts to level off. With Labor Day approaching, and no certainty about the government's next cotton production report, private sources still mention boll weevil damage in the eastern and central cotton belts. Reports from Texas and Oklahoma are also unsatisfactory, with talk of small cotton bolls still prevalent. Private cotton production estimates now indicate that this season's cotton production is 600,000 bales less than the average of last month's private estimates, but still about 300,000 bales more than the official estimate of the previous season. The market still shows a strong bullish sentiment, but not as strong as before, as it awaits new developments in cotton production and the release of the government's next cotton production report. Weekend statistics are attached below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, more than a dozen rice boats from various gangs arrived in South Shanghai. Due to unfavorable weather, transactions were sluggish. New early rice and old broken Zhongguan rice were lowered by two dimes compared to the previous market. Early and late rice arrived and sold evenly, with no rise or fall in the market. However, when the weather turned overcast, some people purchased, and the price increased by nearly a dime.</p>
<p>There were not many goods arriving from various gangs on Xinzha West Road. The market opened tight and then weakened in the morning. Changzhou-Wuxi North rice was priced firmly, slightly softer by one dime. New early rice and new special rice were sold as they arrived. The market opened stably. Thin rice saw no change. About 2,000 shi of various goods were opened at the river mills.</p>
<h3 id="e132">More Than 600 Bags of Hunan Rice Arrived <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Imported Rice Prices Stabilize</p>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market remained stable due to the firmness of the cargo owners' intentions. The demand from local merchants was good. Merchants from other provinces mostly watched the situation due to the unrest and then inquired further, so the market was unable to turn around. The agent market opened with 2,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice priced at 9.40 to 9.31 yuan, and 1,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice priced at 8.85 to 8.67 yuan, all of which were bought by local merchants. Dealers from rural areas only handled 200-300 bags. There were more than 2,000 bags of Hunan rice in Shanghai, but due to the high cost and the low selling price caused by imported rice, cargo owners were mostly unwilling to sell at a loss, so transactions in the market have long lacked agreement. Yesterday, 100 bags of Hunan-made Yuan Zhongguan goods were transshipped by the Xiamen gang at a price of 13.20 yuan. In addition, 200 bags of Ji Jing rice were purchased by local merchants at a price of 8.82 yuan. The price of Ji Jing rice was slightly lower than the opening price the day before, and the future market still looks weak, because a batch of goods continued to arrive yesterday afternoon via Jiangda ships, totaling more than 600 bags, including 200 bags of Ji Yuan rice and the rest being Ji various Jing rice, imported by Yutai Dafeng and others.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of each month generally showed a flat and weak trend. Although the quoted price of imported wheat was about two or three dimes higher, due to the unrest and many rumors, both internal and external buyers and sellers tended to wait and see. Large factories were busy with private birthday celebrations and had no intention of trading. Small and medium-sized factories were also inactive because they had no certainty about imported wheat. However, due to the lack of actual sales, the market atmosphere inevitably turned weak. As a result, this month's price remained unchanged, October's price was down by 0.25%, November's price was down by 0.5%, December's price was down by 0.75%, January's price was down by 1%, and February's price was down by 0.25%.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Wheat Market Sees Sluggish Buying <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was generally flat and weak. Although the quoted price of imported wheat was two or three dimes higher, the sluggish buying was unexpected. The main reason was the unstable situation, and the factories were all holding a temporary wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, transactions were rare, and it seemed to be in a state of decline. As a result, this month's price remained unchanged, November's price was down by 0.2%, and the prices for December, January, and February were unchanged. There was not much activity in the spot wheat market. Only 1,000 bags of Shaoxing wheat were opened at 3.356 yuan, which was purchased by Xinda.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Wuxi Autumn Cocoon Market Preparing to Open <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Wuxi is a famous cocoon-producing area. This year's spring and summer cocoons were damaged by the weather, resulting in a poor harvest. Officials and merchants have jointly promoted autumn sericulture, so silkworm rearing is not weak. Now the early batches are in major dormancy and thriving, and silk cocoon merchants are renting cocoon markets to prepare for weighing and purchasing autumn cocoons. It is estimated that about 20 cocoon markets have reported to the association and are preparing to open. They are currently hiring craftsmen to repair cocoon stoves, and it is expected that they will be able to open for business in a week at the latest.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Strong Silk Sales in Europe and America <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai was still strong. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson, Dachang, and others imported 70 bales of 13-15 denier Shanghai white filature from Jin Shuangying, Maple Leaf, and Youyong brands, priced from 655 to 685 taels. Lainier and others imported 85 taels from the local machine. Cheung Kee and others imported 30 bales of HK brand No. 23 Mianhuang raw silk, priced at 415 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Foreign Tea Market Turns Quiet <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, transactions of Zhenmei from Wuyuan and Tunxi were scarce. There were also no large transactions of needle tea and pearl tea. European firms are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude because of the recent rumors and fluctuating exchange rates. Although the Russian Aid Association has received telegrams from Moscow requesting Gongxi green tea and has not slackened its intention to purchase, its bid is still 5 to 10 taels lower. Due to cost considerations, Chinese tea merchants are unwilling to make excessive concessions and sell, so there has been no major development in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e138">North-South Goods, Xu Kuizi and Sichuan Black Fungus All Rise <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>After Xu Kuizi's price rose by 13 taels, the trend was quite tight. Yesterday, it was heard that more than 200 bags were opened at a price of 13.5 taels, an increase of 0.5 taels. However, it is still difficult to increase the stock price, because there are still previous goods for sale, so it is inevitable to make concessions. Sales have been good recently, and the market is stable. The price of black fungus was very low this year due to the bumper harvest. For example, the previous price of top-grade Sichuan black fungus was 58 taels, but now the price has rebounded due to improved sales. Yesterday, it was heard that the price was opened at 60 taels, and the traders sold the high-grade fungus at 58 taels, which was also due to the recovery from extreme weakness. The market is expected to stabilize in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e139">A Large Batch of Tinplate Fluctuates in the Hardware Market <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Hardware transactions have been idle recently, and the overall trend in the city remains unremarkable. However, it is widely rumored that the Gengzi Indemnity Committee and the National Government Construction Committee will be selling a large batch of tinplate spot goods, which has affected the stable tinplate market and caused a sluggish market. The current market estimate is 10.025 taels for 90 pounds and 2.25 taels for 100 pounds. It is heard that not many businesses are opening.</p>
<p>There Have Been Transactions in Black Iron Sheet. The northern merchants all decorated the black iron sheet yesterday, and the market situation is no longer as deserted as before. Yesterday, it was heard that the Tianjin gang bought 400-500 dan, and the Yantai and Qingdao also transacted 100+ dan. The price for 18 sheets is estimated at 8.5 taels, and 36 feet is estimated at 8.25 taels. The opening price of the company's iron is very firm. The number of 200-pound company iron arriving recently is not large, and many factories and merchants have made transactions. The market trend has long been in short supply, so the opening price is extremely firm. The price of Fengyu brand is estimated at 23 taels, the old steel factory is 22 taels, and the new steel factory is 21.5 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Sales of White Coal are Active <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, merchants from Hangzhou, Datong, Zhenjiang, and other places all purchased a small amount of white coal. The number of transactions in the market has increased slightly. It is estimated that the total number of transactions in the city reached more than 900 tons. The Hangzhou merchants bought 80 tons of Mark coal and 110 tons of Liujiang coal. The Datong merchants bought 150 tons of Liujiang coal, 40 tons of No. 1 Great Wall, and 60 tons of Haifeng coal. The Zhenjiang merchants bought 180 tons of Mark coal, 20 tons of Liujiang coal, and 50 tons of Hongqi coal. The local merchants also purchased 207 tons. The market price has only increased by 0.25 taels for Haifeng coal and 0.1 tael for Great Wall coal. The prices of other goods have not changed.</p>
