<p>時評</p>
<h3>誰負訓練靑年的責任彬</h3>
<p>自日前「救亡與訓練靑年」一評發表後。記者曾數接靑年來函質疑。所質之點。大概　　「誰爲我們的模範。」與「誰配訓練我們兩問題。」記者於此。更廻憶去年此時旅行東北。在東北大學講演講畢。忽有學生發問曰。「中外歷史上之偉人。足爲我輩靑年模楷者固多。但今日在我國内。在我東北。政治上之領袖人物。究有誰人足以爲我輩之模楷。」記者沉思默念。竟久久無以對。檢視今日靑年質疑之函。廻憶在東北大學講演時之舊事。深感「誰爲我們的模範。」與「誰配訓練我們」兩問題。誠爲當前敎育上之絕大問題。吾人日責靑年好亂成性。華不務實。驕縱因循。而竟不一反省所責望於靑年者。自身是否曾已一一實踐。更深感敎育靑年。不在於死的書本。不在於死的模範。而在於活的現實。活的標本。舉凡政治上社會上之形形色色。以及政治領袖與社會領袖之行爲。皆爲靑年最有效之敎材。己正而後可以正人。己立而後可以立人。今日之政治如斯。社會如斯。耳濡目染。潛移默化。日爲靑年實施惡果之敎育。而乃向靑年責善。是眞有若綠木而求魚。</p>
<p>吾人今且暫置政治上社會上之一般人物不言。但就與靑年最相關切之敎育界人士而論。檢查最近數年來之敎育界。其中固不乏自重自好品學卓絕都足以爲學生之模楷之士。然而由於官僚主義之侵入敎育界。敎育亦成爲暗黑。一般敎師之自失其師資者。固亦滔滔皆是。茲請就敎育界之一般現。象略舉數　。</p>
<p>邇年以來國内學潮彼伏此興。不可遏抑。人皆曰由於學生之好亂。由於學風之替落。實則按其實際。察其背景。殆無一次學潮。不有敎師爲其主動。派别之角逐。位置之競爭。以及私人之嫌怨。皆利用學生爲工具。推波興瀾。不惜犧牲學生。以顧全一己之權利。於是而師道日替。於是而學風日壞。敎育日趨於破產。此其一也。</p>
<p>學海淵博。孰能盡善。故爲人師者尤當「學而不厭。誨人不倦。」庶能敎學相。長然而今日敎育界之人士。頗多學不求益。敎不求效。時代邁進。己日落後而不自覺。學生前步。則視爲乖戾反常。甚且任意告假缺課。以荒廢學生之時光。此其二也。</p>
<p>「正己正人。立己立人。」吾人旣於上文言之。今日敎育界之不能自重其師資者。如舞塲之留連。博奕之嗜好。以及不正當娛樂之涉染。復如奢靡無度。行止不檢。己不能正。究將何以爲人之則。令學生衷心欽式。更將何以培出佳善之靑年。此其三也。</p>
<p>師生之關係。不僅在於書本上之傳授。而尤在於人格之薰陶。我國往昔敎。育固多缺憾。但一日之師。終身服膺。師道之隆。蓋有自於智識以外之人格感化。即最近歐美最新敎育學説。亦極注重學生之課外生活。今我國在課堂上則爲「説書。」出門則成路人。即智識之傳授。尙恐未能盡責。更談不到人格之薰陶。此其四也。</p>
<p>上述四者。特一隅耳。吾人今日但覺痛哭流涙於敎育之破產與學風之敗</p>
<p>壞。但知靑年之應加以嚴格之訓練。然而吾人果亦曾一反省。陳列於吾人　前之「誰爲靑年的模範。」「誰配訓練靑年」之兩大問題。曷不一深思而長慮。</p>
<h3>停戰要點仍未解决</h3>
<p>停戰會議昨晨第八次大會恊定第一條業經正式通過小組會議今晨有重要討論大會今日休會定明晨再開停戰正式會議、昨晨第八次大會、通過實行停戰條文、惟最關重要之日軍撤退地點及期限問題、仍未解决、中立方面意見、主張劃引翔區爲日軍暫行退駐地段、軍事分組委員會、昨日休會、决定今晨十時再開會議、將有重要討論、大會今日休會、定明晨十時再開、</p>
<h3>會議公表</h3>
<p>停戰正式會議第八次大會、昨午發表公報云、今晨會議、續有進步、協定草案内規定實行停戰之第一條通過、會議休會至星期四再開、以便於休會期間、有暇考慮尙待解决各點、會議休會期間、小組委員會仍繼續開會云、</p>
<h3>討論經過</h3>
<p>停戰會議昨日上午十時、在英總領事館開會一次、至下午　時三十分始散、到我方首席代表外交次長郭泰祺·軍事代表淞滬警備司令戴戟·十九路軍參謀長黃强·外交部情報司長張似旭·外交部秘書鄧中瑩·郭德華·夏奇峯·李鐵錚·十九路軍副官張益中、日方首席代表第九師團長植田謙吉·日使重光葵·軍事代表陸軍參謀長田代皖一郎·海軍參謀長島田繁太郎·日使館書記官林出·及岡　·喜多·水野·阿部·等人、關係國代表英公使藍溥森·美公使詹森·意代辦齊亞諾·及法使代表勒格郎、各國軍事參贊未出席、仍繼續討論停戰協定新草案、歷三時三十分之久、爲會議時間之最長者、唯一之結果、即爲通過協定草案内規定實行停戰之第一條、餘無顯著之發展、微聞停戰協定新草案内容、正文五條、規定停戰撤兵大綱、附件四條、規定停戰撤兵細則、尙有我方軍獨宣言一則正文第一條、實行停戰、第二條、中國軍隊、暫駐現在防綫、第三條、日軍撤退程序、第四條、共同委員會、證明共同撤兵、第五條、協定簽字之日、發生效力、連日會議正式通過者、爲第一第四及第五三條、附件一、我軍駐防地點、附件二、日軍退駐地點、附件三共同委員會之組織及辦事細則附件四協定所用之文字現尙未决定者、即日軍退駐地點、至於我方單獨宣言、係關於撤退區域之行政、即以我國警察維持該項區域治安一節、</p>
<h3>今晨形勢</h3>
<p>久懸未决之日軍撤退地點及期限問題、均由大會交付軍事分組委員會研究停戰大會、徘徊曲折、關鍵仍在於所謂租界「毘連地段」之末能圓滿解决、微聞星期一、軍事分組委員會會議時、中立方面意見、主張暫劃引翔區爲日軍退駐地點、蓋以引翔區毘連楊樹浦、對於基本原則上所載明之「毘連地段」一點最爲適當、前日會議公報所稱、已議至一要點或即指此、但未官方證實耳、日人方面消息、日方軍部對於吳淞江灣閘北可不堅持惟、淞滬路以東之江灣區域、以至張華浜、不能放棄、昨日軍事分组委員會、休會以便將議及要點、商諸雙方首席代表、决定今晨十時再開會議、當有重要之討論、蓋明晨大會之關鍵、端在今日小組會議之結果也、</p>
<h3>國外消息</h3>
<p>國民新聞社二十八日華盛頓電云、此間頃接東京消息、日本陸軍省、已接日代表電告、上海停戰會議、關於日兵撤退日期及地點目下成爲僵局、因此陸軍當局、刻正考慮萬一談判决裂後之應付步驟、惟美京人士意見、以爲日軍部雖抱强硬態度、其財力能否相副、亦一問題據東京另一報告、則日本朝野、正以國庫拮据與經濟界凋疲、深慮日鈔價格之大跌、今後日鈔設果狂跌、則預計下一會計年度所發公債、勢須增至日金七億五千萬元、故日政府刻方考慮使人民認募此鉅額公債之計劃、蓋日本旣有對華軍事行動、此項公債勢、將不能在英美市塲發行、必須募諸國内、而不景氣之日本、經濟界能否勝此重擔、亦一煞費考量之問題、按日政府業經批准之公債、已有四種、即彌補一九三二年預算不足之一億一千萬元、實業公債二千七百萬元、滿洲軍費五千九百萬元、及特别會計六千七百萬元、此外尙待批准者二種、一爲失業救濟費五千萬元、一爲滿洲軍費一億元、以上六種公債、已達四億一千三百萬元之鉅、若日鈔大跌後、則估計將再需增發三億餘元、故此問意見、認日財政狀况、旣艱窘若是、恐將籌再長期負擔上海軍費、不得不迅謀結束戰事也、</p>
<h3>紀五廟附近日軍昨晨向我攻擊</h3>
<p>我軍亦開槍抵抗至晚間槍聲方停上海市公安局昨日下午四時餘、接得滬西六區一分所電話報告稱、據華漕派所報告云、本日上午八時、離華漕西首約八九里地之紀王廟附近日軍、以步槍向我駐軍八十八師税警團第四連步哨射擊、我軍前哨、亦開槍還擊、遂發生小接觸、至下午四時四十三分止、華漕方面仍能聞得槍聲、故衝突尙未停止、迨至晚間十一時、公安局方面復以電話詢問六區一分所、調查下午四時以後情形、據稱因紀王廟離華漕約有八九里地、而華漕離六區一分所又有八九里之遙、又在深夜故未能探悉詳細情形、惟據由該處來滬之老百姓云、紀王廟方面本日中日兩軍確起衝突、但係小接觸、故槍聲較疎、至晚間十一時後、槍聲已停、又據一分所云、明日（即今晨）上午當可得到詳細情形、届時再行報告總局云云、</p>
<p>又訊、昨晨八時許、距離華漕八里許之紀王廟日軍哨兵、又開槍向我軍第八十八師防綫襲擊、迨逼近我軍陣地、我軍乃奮起迎擊、北新涇一帶可聞甚淸晰之槍聲直至下午六時尙未停止、據由該處逃滬難民云、途次曾親見日軍軍用卡車三輛車上載有日傷兵、運赴後方醫治、</p>
<h3>日軍攻擊太倉</h3>
<p>前綫日軍積極備戰蘇州二十九日專電云、二十九午午、太倉方面、來敵二百餘攻我○○○旅○團陣地、戰一小時、被我軍擊退、我死傷兵士十一、敵傷亡甚多黃渡日軍、現改由十四師團驻防、瀏河嘉定敵第九師團已撤、由第十第十六兩師團接防、第一道防線在　塘·朱　橋間、自黃渡起、經車站外岡·葛隆鎭·爲敵嘉定間外哨防綫、葛隆鎭被日寇數十、挨户搜索黃渡站西、敵掘壕佈鐵絲網、岳王市東南十二里橫塘、日軍佈防掘壕、砲口對太倉、浮橋瀏河間鄉村、遭日軍焚路甚慘、</p>
<p>常熟二十九日下午六時專電云、岳王市·浮橋·七丫口·牌樓確無敵踪、浮橋二十九晨開市、茜涇敵置三十生的大砲、</p>
<p>大美晚報云、日軍工兵隊、已在江灣西區、築成鞏固之戰壕線、並廣遠之有剌鐵絲障碍物、華軍舊居之陣地、現經逐漸毁除、且在數處刻平墳墓、以淸火線之障碍、現又在閘北築造第二道防線、該防線自中山路電氣交流站對面起、至公共租界邊際極司非而村止、</p>
<p>日軍行動</p>
<h3>日警出勤</h3>
<p>日本調派警察五十名來滬、預備派至虹口閘北等處、擔任巡查之責、當經日領事署花里警察署長、將此五十名日警敎授華語等項、至昨日訓練已成、定今日起、派赴各地出勤服務、</p>
<h3>日軍續撤</h3>
<p>昨日日軍司令白川義則、發布訓令以現在後方之通信隊·衛生隊·交通隊·等雜色部隊、事實上殊無留滬之必要、爲節减出后兵費用起見、决將上項各隊開拔還國已在候輪運送、</p>
<h3>日組水巡隊</h3>
<p>某機關昨據浦江水巡隊梁總隊長報告、日軍自昨日起、組織水上巡查隊、計有汽船兩艘、懸掛太陽　、每船有武裝日海軍二十餘人、晝夜巡　於浦東高橋沿浦江一帶、惟並未登岸、</p>
<h3>日第三艦隊準備撤退訊</h3>
<p>在滬日本軍艦、有一部已奉到撤退之準備命令、俟停戰會議有切實的决定、便將開拔、茲將情形詳誌如下、</p>
<h3>駐滬日海軍幹部</h3>
<p>自一二八</p>
<p>戰事發生後、日本因迭次戰爭失利、先後遣派之海軍、共有戰艦驅逐艦並魚雷艦等四十七艘、其間别爲第三艦隊、司令長官爲野村吉三郎中將、第三戰隊司令少將堀悌吉、參謀長少將島田繁太郎、第一外遣隊司令鹽澤少將、第一水雷隊司令有地大佐、第二艦隊司令中將末信正、（已乘夕張旗艦返日）第二水雷隊司令少將井上繼松、第一航空隊司令少將加藤隆義、參謀長少將中村龜三郎、</p>
<h3>第三艦隊將撤退</h3>
<p>第三艦隊爲此次戰事中攻擊吳淞砲臺之主力艦隊、即係野村所統之巡洋艦出雲海防艦大井·能登吕及第二隊驅逐艦二十四隊魚雷艦、並第一水雷隊第一航空隊等等、又有特别陸戰隊四千名、現出雲旗艦停在日領署前、航空母艦停瀏河外口、水雷隊停鴨窩砂海面、現在準備候命歸國中、</p>
<h3>長江艦隊之擴充</h3>
<p>第一外遣隊鹽澤司令已赴漢口、對掦子江上游前曾撤退至下游者現自本月二十七日起、經鹽澤决定恢復上游日艦之巡行、長沙·重慶·均開始派艦前往、而第一外遣隊之在揚子江内者、本祇十四艦、今决將對馬·宇治·天龍·常磐·等四艦加入長江、此四艘均爲海防艦、排水量各在五千噸以上、從此日海軍之在揚子江内勢力益巨、而漢口且增駐陸戰隊一千五百名、</p>
<h3>久留上海之日艦</h3>
<p>據日海軍方面消息、停戰會議、决定日本第三艦隊所屬之第三戰隊第一水雷第一航空各隊撤歸佐世保後、出雲艦决留駐上海、而第二水雷隊之一部、將會同揚子江第一外遣隊各艦、久駐上海、華北方面之第二外遣隊、則仍令駐於靑島·天津·各口岸、</p>
<h3>日報宣傳之滬自由港運動</h3>
<p>十國僑民共同組織委員會計畫大綱三項已略經决定因顧及華方感情尙恐宣洩三月二十一日大連滿洲報云、關於計畫以上海爲自由港事、當事變以前、已爲之進行、然卒未成事、竟歸流產、茲據最近由美國　工會議所露出之消息、謂因事變、愈痛感有設强力之市政府與維持治安機關之必要、各國僑民間、此次均高唱希望、劃爲自由港、且爲此項方針而進行各種計畫、聞英美法德俄意葡波捷日等十國僑民、舉出委員廿名並由其中選出七名專任委員、以構成小委員會、十四日正値國聯調查委員抵滬之際、又在法國俱樂部開第三次小委員會、熟議其計畫大綱等、查英方委員爲哈里斯氏等二名、日方委員爲在華紡紗聯合會總務理事船津辰一郎氏、及上海日本商工會議所會頭米里絞吉氏等、其計畫大綱中略經决定者如左、</p>
<p>一·以上海爲中心二十苦羅米突線内爲自由港之範圍、</p>
<p>二·推華人名望家任市長、</p>
<p>三·除工部局以外、並置一强力行政治安維持機關、由自由港掃盡所有種種中國軍閥之支配權、</p>

<h3>一般人差誤的心理</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>有幾位短視的先生們，看了昨日的報紙，或者近日的報紙，似乎有一種間壁希望在後面，心絃上勃勃地跳動，急盼報上所説一切一切的消息，立時實現，這正眞是夢想，正眞是大差而特差，</p>
<p>他們的希望若何？</p>
<p>一蘇俄陸軍委員機關報紅旗報社論聲稱，日美奪取太平洋霸權之戰爭，勢已無可避免，</p>
<p>希望美國馬上出兵，與日本打個你死我活，</p>
<p>一墨索里尼評論遠東時局，謂蘇俄不久即與中國聯盟，出而問鼎於世，希望蘇俄馬上出來帮帮我國的忙，</p>
<p>一日本財政益形竭蹶，漸呈混亂之象，并且革命潮流，日見澎湃，政府决定嚴厲取締，</p>
<p>希望日本財政破產，希望革命份子去内部搗亂，</p>
<p>一日本傳出消息，倘國聯堅持實施關於滿洲事件之數項决議案，即日本將退出國聯，</p>
<p>希望國聯積極實行，若日本退出國聯，使世界認識日本爲破壞遠東和平之罪魁，而爲引起世界戰爭之魔王，</p>
<p>以上四種希望，雖未必絕對無可能性，即使可能，亦猶如打嗎啡之針可以暫緩目前的危局，但總不是根本解决的辦法試問任何一國，不圖自强而專希望人家帮忙，人家自亂，而可站立於物競天擇優勝劣敗的世界麽？故這種希望，我呌做他間壁的希望，與自己本身，不發生任何關係，</p>
<p>我的希望是</p>
<p>一我國立刻成立一有組織，有計劃，有能威與沈毅勇敢的政府，</p>
<p>一軍閥政客，貪官汚吏，土豪劣紳不要趁火打刦搗亂後方，</p>
<p>一我們的軍人，盡要如十九路軍翁旅長所説，「我們最後的一滴血，總要灑在敵人的陣綫裏，纔算盡我們軍人的天職，」</p>

<h3>烟幕彈</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>烟幕彈用於蔽藏軍艦，建築物，或一切軍事行動，使敵人失其射擊目標，爲用至大。有黑色和白色二，種化學藥品裝入彈殼，用輕量炸藥爆發之。彈可裝入平常任何砲口。</p>
<p>平常所用，大槪爲白色烟幕，因：一，易於使用。二，其不透明程度較黑色爲更甚，其主要化學成份爲四氣化錫（Ｓｎ　Ｃｉ４）可作簡單試騐如下：</p>
<p>用品除製綠氣所需如徵君所述外，另備Ｕ形管一，中實氯化鈣Ｃａ　Ｃｉ２用以乾燥綠氣者，粗玻璃管一直徑約十五糎或二十糎者，長頸瓶一，平常玻璃管二枝，一直一灣，象皮管及錫若干。</p>
<p>先將大玻管實錫之細粒或條，二端各塞一鑽洞之軟木塞。一塞揷入灣玻管，灣玻管之另一端通入長頸瓶，近底而止，另一塞揷入直玻管而以象皮管通至Ｕ形管之一端，長頸瓶須浸入冷水或冰中，即大玻管亦須設法使冷，於是將製綠氣裝置接至Ｕ形管之另一端上，漸見長頸瓶中滴下黃色液體，是即四氣化錫·以之傾在桌上或地上，即發極濃之白色烟霧（如空氣温度太低·須稍加熱）</p>
<p>是因當四氣化錫與空氣接觸時，與細液點，因其比重甚密故不易吹散。製時所用各物須極乾燥者，綠氣亦必極乾燥而純凈。往往於接至Ｕ形管之前，先通入承水之二口瓶中洗之·製綠氣如不用徵君所述，可用漂白粉加硫酸則得氯</p>

<h3>孩子們的民族反抗性</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>時間是一天下午·地點是一個外國公園，在這個死氣沈沈的上海社會裏，我居然得看一幕反抗的富有偉大的民族性的活劇在可歌可泣的開演着。</p>
<p>在一片曠大的草塲上，一羣碧眼綠睛的外國小孩子們，和一羣黃臉黑髮的中國小孩子們，在混亂地大家玩踢着一個小皮球，其間不知道什麽綠故，忽發生衝突起來，那碧眼綠睛的外國小孩子們，馬上停止踢球，集合在一邊，輕蔑地狰獰地向中國小孩子們辱駡，其中有一個較大的中國小孩子忍不住氣也向他們還駡一聲，於此那一羣集合在一起的外國小孩子竟下動員令奔向中國小孩子進攻，狠狠的包圍着毆打，這時候，其餘那幾個中國小孩子忽不約而同地也集合起來幫助那個被打的同伴向那羣如狼如虎的外國小孩子厮打，他們的人數雖然很少，但他們却毫不示弱地無所顧慮地在那裏盡力地厮打着，其中有一個較小的，被一個外國小孩子打倒在地下，兩手叉住咽喉，但他還是在地下用雙脚，小小的雙脚，向那個外國小孩子亂蹬亂踢。一直等到巡捕來驅散了他們才各人拖着一身扯爤的衣服，和滿臉紅腫的傷痕，一面一步一回頭地在怒目的視着他們的敵人，一面很慷慨地昻然地徐步出公園門口。</p>
<p>呵呵，我眞料不到這樣可歌可泣的偉大的民族反抗性，却在這寥寥幾個的孩子們身上表現出來：能毫不示弱毫無顧慮而勇敢的反抗的，不期只有這寥寥幾個的小孩子！這種可歌可泣的事在這個死氣沈沈淪陷於鐵蹄下的上海社會裏，你能找到第二件嗎？這種光榮壯烈的人，在這個已經亡了半截的中國裏你能夠找到第二個嗎？有人説，一般人之所以没有和孩子們一樣的民族反抗性，是因爲一般人都缺乏和孩子們一樣坦直而純潔的心。在此，我眞不禁要喊一聲反抗的孩子們萬歲</p>
<p>孩子們的心萬歲</p>
<p>一鱗一爪</p>
<h3>送客</h3>
<p>— 無朋</p>
<p>老王忽然這樣想：「李老爺莫是出乎其類拔乎其萃了。我每次差不多每次從他家裏出來的時候·他總要客客氣氣的親自把我送出大門，有時候還望着走了老遠的路才轉回頭。我這樣一個窮光蛋·也値得有錢的李老爺當貴客招待麽？有錢人看不起窮人·我想我想只有勢利的狗才會這樣。像李老爺確確是個例外的例外例外！的例外！」他越想越覺得李老爺是個了不得的人物而自已也彷彿突然的高貴起來了似的。</p>
<p>有一次老王把帽子掉到李老爺家裏了。他走了老遠才想起·於是趕忙回頭。可是當他將要踏進門限的時候·突然給李太太的吵聲阻止着·不好意思前進了。他立定了脚聽李太太説：</p>
<p>「你這人我眞不懂！老王什麽東西每次來向你借錢的時候·你總是恭恭敬敬的送他到大門外。你也眞不怕麻煩！眞不怕失了身分！若使我送了一次客·你看那還了得！不是「有違婦道」·就是「」我眞不懂！」</p>
<p>「你們女人家懂得什麽。」李老開口了。「我送客·有我送客的哲學呢！趙隊長來要送·爲着發生不測之事·他可以帮忙。周老伯來要送·爲着他比我們的錢更多。老王·哈哈！你别看他不起！越要送！怕他偷咱的東西！你懂麽」</p>
<p>李老爺似乎還有話説。李太太也似乎答了幾句。不過·老王没有再聽下去。他聽到這裏·感到一種塌天大禍的不安。帽子也不要了·掉回就跑。出了一頭冷汗·嘴裏似乎哼着「唔我明白了。」</p>

<h3>Who is Responsible for Training Youth?</h3>
<p>Since the publication of a commentary entitled "Saving the Nation and Training Youth" some days ago, this reporter has received numerous letters from young people raising questions. The points they question mainly concern "Who is our role model?" and "Who is qualified to train us?" At this point, this reporter recalls a trip to the Northeast last year. After finishing a lecture at Northeastern University, a student suddenly asked, "There are many great figures in Chinese and foreign history who can serve as role models for us young people. But today, within our country, in our Northeast, which political leaders are truly worthy of being our role models?" The reporter pondered in silence, unable to answer for a long time. Examining the letters of inquiry from today's youth and recalling the old incident during the lecture at Northeastern University, I deeply feel that the two questions, "Who is our role model?" and "Who is qualified to train us?" are indeed the greatest problems in current education. We constantly blame young people for being fond of creating chaos, lacking practicality, being arrogant and following old ways, yet we do not reflect on whether we ourselves have practiced what we expect from young people. I further feel that educating youth is not about dead books, not about dead role models, but about living reality and living examples. All kinds of things in politics and society, as well as the behavior of political and social leaders, are the most effective teaching materials for young people. Only by being upright oneself can one correct others. Only by establishing oneself can one establish others. Today's politics is like this, society is like this. What is seen and heard gradually influences and subtly changes, educating young people with evil consequences every day. Yet we demand good from the youth. Is this not truly like climbing a tree to catch fish?</p>
<p>Let us now temporarily put aside general figures in politics and society. Let us focus on those in the education sector, who are most closely related to young people. Examining the education sector in recent years, there is no lack of individuals who value themselves, are virtuous, and academically outstanding, all of whom are worthy of being role models for students. However, due to the encroachment of bureaucracy into the education sector, education has also become dark. Many general teachers have lost their qualifications as teachers. Let us briefly list a few of the general phenomena in the education sector.</p>
<p>In recent years, student movements have arisen and fallen one after another in the country, and cannot be suppressed. People all say it is due to students' fondness for creating chaos and the decline of the academic atmosphere. But in reality, observing the background, almost every student movement has teachers behind it, actively involved. Factional competition, the competition for positions, and personal grievances all use students as tools to stir up trouble, sacrificing students to protect one's own rights. Thus, the way of teachers declines day by day. Thus, the academic atmosphere deteriorates day by day. Education is increasingly going bankrupt. This is one aspect.</p>
<p>The sea of learning is vast, and who can be perfect? Therefore, teachers should especially "learn without being tired and teach without being weary" so that teaching and learning can complement each other. However, many people in today's education sector do not seek improvement in their studies and do not seek effectiveness in their teaching. As the times advance, they are lagging behind and do not realize it. If students take a step forward, they are regarded as rebellious and abnormal. They even arbitrarily take leave and miss classes, wasting students' time. This is another aspect.</p>
<p>"Correct yourself and correct others. Establish yourself and establish others." We have already said this in the previous text. Today's education sector cannot respect its teachers. They frequent dance halls, are fond of gambling, and are involved in improper entertainment. They are also extravagant and do not restrain their behavior. If one cannot be upright oneself, how can one be a role model for others, allowing students to sincerely admire and emulate them? And how can one cultivate outstanding youth? This is another aspect.</p>
<p>The relationship between teachers and students is not only about the transmission of knowledge in books but also about the cultivation of personality. Our country's past education had many shortcomings, but one day as a teacher meant lifelong respect. The prominence of the teacher's way stemmed from the influence of personality beyond knowledge. Even the latest European and American educational theories also pay great attention to students' extracurricular life. Today, in our country, in the classroom, it is just "storytelling." Once out of the door, they become strangers. Even the transmission of knowledge may not be done to the fullest extent, not to mention the cultivation of personality. This is another aspect.</p>
<p>The above four points are just one corner. Today, we only feel like weeping and lamenting the bankruptcy of education and the decline of the academic atmosphere. We only know that young people should be strictly trained. But have we ever reflected on the two major questions placed before us: "Who is the role model for youth?" "Who is qualified to train youth?" Why not think deeply and consider carefully?</p>
<h3>The Key Points of the Ceasefire Have Not Been Resolved</h3>
<p>The eighth plenary session of the ceasefire conference yesterday morning agreed that the first article had been formally passed. The working group meeting had an important discussion this morning. The conference is adjourned today and scheduled to reconvene tomorrow morning for the formal ceasefire conference. The eighth plenary session of the formal ceasefire conference yesterday morning passed the provisions for implementing the ceasefire. However, the most important issues of the location and deadline for the Japanese army's withdrawal have not yet been resolved. The neutral parties' opinion is to designate the Yinxiang District as the temporary withdrawal location for the Japanese army. The Military Subcommittee was adjourned yesterday and decided to reconvene at 10:00 this morning for an important discussion. The conference is adjourned today and scheduled to reconvene at 10:00 tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Conference</h3>
<p>The eighth plenary session of the formal ceasefire conference issued a press release yesterday afternoon, stating that the morning meeting made further progress. The first article of the draft agreement on implementing the ceasefire was passed. The meeting adjourned until Thursday to allow time to consider the remaining points to be resolved during the recess. The subcommittee will continue to meet during the recess.</p>
<h3>Discussion Process</h3>
<p>The ceasefire conference held a meeting at the British Consulate at 10:00 yesterday morning and adjourned at 3:30 in the afternoon. The attendees included our chief representative, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, military representative Commander of the Songhu Garrison Dai Ji, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army Huang Qiang, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhang Sixu, Secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Deng Zhongying, Guo Dehua, Xia Qifeng, Li Tiezheng, Adjutant of the 19th Route Army Zhang Yizhong, the Japanese chief representative, Commander of the 9th Division Ueteda Kenkichi, Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Kui, military representatives Chief of Staff of the Army Tashiro Wanichiro, Chief of Staff of the Navy Shimada Shigetaro, Secretaries of the Japanese Embassy Hayashide, Ogawa, Kita, Mizuno, Abe, etc., and representatives of related countries, British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano, and French Minister representative Legrand. Military attaches from various countries did not attend. They continued to discuss the new draft of the ceasefire agreement for three hours and thirty minutes, the longest meeting time. The only result was the passage of the first article of the draft agreement on implementing the ceasefire. There were no other significant developments. It is rumored that the content of the new draft ceasefire agreement includes five articles in the main text, stipulating the outline of the ceasefire and troop withdrawal, and four articles in the annex, stipulating the details of the ceasefire and troop withdrawal. There is also a separate declaration from our side. The first article of the main text is to implement the ceasefire. The second article is that the Chinese army will temporarily garrison in the current defense line. The third article is the procedure for the Japanese army's withdrawal. The fourth article is that the joint committee will verify the joint troop withdrawal. The fifth article is that the agreement will take effect on the date of signing. The first, fourth, and fifth articles that have been formally passed in the recent days' meetings. Annex 1: The location of our army's garrison. Annex 2: The location of the Japanese army's withdrawal. Annex 3: The organization and operating rules of the joint committee. Annex 4: The text used in the agreement. The issue that has not yet been decided is the location of the Japanese army's withdrawal. As for our side's separate declaration, it concerns the administration of the withdrawn area, that is, the section on maintaining the security of that area with our country's police.</p>
<h3>Situation This Morning</h3>
<p>The unresolved issue of the location and deadline for the Japanese army's withdrawal was referred to the Military Subcommittee by the General Assembly. The ceasefire conference is hovering and twisting, and the key lies in the unsatisfactory resolution of the so-called "adjacent sections" of the concession. It is rumored that during the meeting of the Military Subcommittee on Monday, the neutral parties suggested temporarily designating the Yinxiang District as the Japanese army's withdrawal location. This is because the Yinxiang District is adjacent to Yangshupu, which is most appropriate for the "adjacent sections" mentioned in the basic principles. What the press release of the previous day's meeting called "a key point has been discussed" may refer to this, but it has not been officially confirmed. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese military headquarters will not insist on Wusong River, Jiangwan, or Zhabei, but the Jiangwan area east of Songhu Road up to Zhanghuabang cannot be abandoned. The Military Subcommittee adjourned yesterday to discuss the key points with the chief representatives of both sides. It was decided to reconvene at 10:00 this morning for an important discussion. The key to tomorrow morning's conference lies in the result of today's working group meeting.</p>
<h3>Foreign News</h3>
<p>The National News Agency Washington电报 on the 28th reported that a message was received here from Tokyo that the Japanese Ministry of the Army had received a telegram from the Japanese representative stating that the Shanghai ceasefire conference had reached a deadlock regarding the date and location of the Japanese troop withdrawal. Therefore, the Army authorities are currently considering contingency measures in case the negotiations break down. However, opinions in Washington believe that although the Japanese military is holding a tough attitude, whether its financial resources can match it is also a question. According to another report from Tokyo, the Japanese government and public are deeply worried about the sharp drop in the price of Japanese currency due to the tight national treasury and the depression of the economic sector. If the Japanese currency plummets in the future, it is estimated that the public bonds issued in the next fiscal year will have to be increased to 750 million Japanese yen. Therefore, the Japanese government is currently considering a plan to get the people to subscribe to this huge amount of public bonds. Since Japan has military actions against China, this public bond will not be issued in the British and American markets and must be raised domestically. Whether the depressed Japanese economic sector can bear this heavy burden is also a matter of careful consideration. According to the Japanese government's already approved public bonds, there are already four types: 110 million yuan to make up for the budget shortfall in 1932, 27 million yuan for industrial public bonds, 59 million yuan for Manchurian military expenses, and 67 million yuan for special accounting. In addition, there are two types pending approval: 50 million yuan for unemployment relief and 100 million yuan for Manchurian military expenses. The above six types of public bonds have reached a huge sum of 413 million yuan. If the Japanese currency plummets, it is estimated that more than 300 million yuan will need to be issued. Therefore, opinions here believe that since Japan's financial situation is so difficult, it may not be able to afford the long-term burden of Shanghai military expenses and must quickly seek an end to the war.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Near the Jiwang Temple Attacked Us Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Our army also opened fire to resist until the gunshots stopped in the evening. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau received a phone report from the Sixth District Sub-Bureau of West Shanghai at around 4:00 pm yesterday, stating that according to the Huacao Police Station, the Japanese army near the Jiwang Temple, about eight or nine li west of Huacao, fired at the sentry of the Fourth Company of the 88th Division Tax Police Corps with rifles at 8:00 am today. Our forward哨兵 also opened fire to return the fire, and a small engagement occurred. As of 4:43 pm, gunshots could still be heard from the Huacao side, so the conflict had not stopped. Until 11:00 pm, the Public Security Bureau inquired by phone to the Sixth District Sub-Bureau to investigate the situation after 4:00 pm. It was said that because Jiwang Temple is about eight or nine li away from Huacao, and Huacao is also eight or nine li away from the Sixth District Sub-Bureau, and it was late at night, so it was impossible to find out the details. However, according to the common people who came to Shanghai from there, there was indeed a conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies in Jiwang Temple today, but it was a small engagement, so the gunshots were sparse. After 11:00 pm, the gunshots had stopped. According to the sub-bureau, detailed information will be available tomorrow (that is, this morning) and will be reported to the General Bureau at that time.</p>
<p>Also, at around 8:00 am yesterday, the Japanese army sentries at Jiwang Temple, about eight li away from Huacao, opened fire and attacked our army's defense line of the 88th Division. When they approached our army's position, our army bravely resisted. Clear gunshots could be heard in the Beixinjing area until 6:00 pm, it had not stopped. According to the refugees who escaped to Shanghai from there, they personally saw three Japanese military trucks loaded with Japanese wounded soldiers being transported to the rear for treatment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attacks Taicang</h3>
<p>The Japanese army on the front line is actively preparing for war. A special telegram from Suzhou on the 29th stated that at noon on the 29th, more than 200 enemies from the Taicang side attacked the position of the ○th Regiment of our ○○○ Brigade. After fighting for one hour, they were repelled by our army. We had 11 soldiers killed and wounded, and the enemy suffered many casualties. The Japanese army at Huangdu has now been replaced by the 14th Division. The enemy's 9th Division at Liuhe Jiading has withdrawn and is replaced by the 10th and 16th Divisions. The first line of defense is between Tang and Zhu Bridge. Starting from Huangdu, passing through the railway station, Waigang, and Gelong Town, is the enemy's outer sentry line between Jiading. Dozens of Japanese寇 searched every household in Gelong Town. West of Huangdu Station, the enemy dug trenches and set up barbed wire. At Hengtang, twelve li southeast of Yuewang City, the Japanese army set up defenses and dug trenches, with the artillery pointed at Taicang. The villages between Fuqiao and Liuhe were severely burned by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>A special telegram from Changshu at 6:00 pm on the 29th stated that there were definitely no enemy traces at Yuewang City, Fuqiao, Qi'yako, and Pailou. The market opened in Fuqiao on the morning of the 29th. The enemy placed 30 large cannons in Qianjing.</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News stated that the Japanese army's engineering team has built a solid trench line in the west area of Jiangwan and extensive barbed wire obstacles. The positions of the Chinese army's old residences are now being gradually destroyed, and graves are being leveled in several places to clear obstacles for the line of fire. A second line of defense is now being built in Zhabei. This line of defense starts opposite the electrical exchange station on Zhongshan Road and ends at the edge of the Public Concession, Jisi Fei'er Village.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Actions</p>
<h3>Japanese Police on Duty</h3>
<p>Japan dispatched 50 policemen to Shanghai, preparing to send them to Hongkou, Zhabei, and other places to be responsible for patrolling. The chief of the Japanese Consulate's police station, Hanari, taught these 50 Japanese policemen Chinese and other items. The training has been completed as of yesterday and will be sent to various places to provide services starting today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Continues to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Japanese Commander Yoshinori Shirakawa issued an instruction that the various miscellaneous units such as the communication team, the medical team, and the transportation team in the rear are in fact unnecessary to stay in Shanghai. In order to reduce the cost of sending troops back, it was decided to send the above-mentioned teams back to the country and they are already waiting for transportation by ship.</p>
<h3>Japanese Organize Water Patrol Team</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a certain agency reported that according to Liang, the captain of the Pujiang Water Patrol Team, the Japanese army has organized a water patrol team since yesterday. There are two steamships with sun flags hanging on them. Each ship has more than 20 armed Japanese naval personnel patrolling the Pujiang River along the Pudong Gaoqiao area day and night, but they have not landed.</p>
<h3>News of the Japanese Third Fleet's Preparation to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Some Japanese warships stationed in Shanghai have received orders to prepare for withdrawal and will depart after a concrete decision is made at the ceasefire conference. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Naval Officers Stationed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the January 28th incident, Japan has dispatched a total of 47 warships, destroyers, and torpedo boats due to repeated war failures. Among them, the Third Fleet, Commander-in-Chief Vice Admiral Yoshisaburo Nomura, Commander of the Third Battle Squadron Rear Admiral Teikichi Hori, Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Shigetaro Shimada, Commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Team Rear Admiral Shiozawa, Commander of the First Torpedo Squadron Captain Aruchi, Commander of the Second Fleet Vice Admiral Tadashi Suenobu (has returned to Japan on the flagship Yubari), Commander of the Second Torpedo Squadron Rear Admiral Tsugumatsu Inoue, Commander of the First Air Squadron Rear Admiral Takayoshi Kato, Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Kamesaburo Nakamura.</p>
<h3>The Third Fleet Will Withdraw</h3>
<p>The Third Fleet is the main fleet that attacked the Wusong Forts in this war. It is the cruiser Izumo, the coastal defense ship Oi, the Notoro, and the 24th destroyer squadron, the torpedo boat, and the First Torpedo Squadron and the First Air Squadron, all commanded by Nomura. There are also 4,000 special marine troops. The flagship Izumo is currently moored in front of the Japanese Consulate, the aircraft carrier is moored outside the Liuhe port, and the torpedo squadron is moored on the Yau Wo Sha sea. They are now preparing to return home on order.</p>
<h3>Expansion of the Yangtze River Fleet</h3>
<p>Commander Shiozawa of the First Overseas Dispatch Team has gone to Hankou. The Japanese warships that had previously retreated to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are now being restored to patrol the upper reaches of the river, starting from the 27th of this month, as decided by Shiozawa. Warships have begun to be sent to Changsha and Chongqing. The First Overseas Dispatch Team in the Yangtze River originally had only 14 ships, but it has now been decided to add four ships to the Yangtze River: Tsushima, Uji, Tenryu, and Tokiwa. These four ships are all coastal defense ships with a displacement of more than 5,000 tons each. From now on, the Japanese navy's power in the Yangtze River will be even greater, and 1,500 marines will be stationed in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships to Remain in Shanghai for a Long Time</h3>
<p>According to Japanese naval sources, after the ceasefire conference decides that the Third Battle Squadron, the First Torpedo Squadron, and the First Air Squadron of the Third Fleet will withdraw to Sasebo, the Izumo will remain stationed in Shanghai, and a part of the Second Torpedo Squadron will join the ships of the First Overseas Dispatch Team in the Yangtze River and remain stationed in Shanghai for a long time. The Second Overseas Dispatch Team in North China will still be stationed in Qingdao and Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Free Port Movement as Promoted by the Japanese Newspaper</h3>
<p>The outline of the Ten-Nation Foreign Residents' Joint Organizing Committee plan has been roughly decided on three items, but it is still feared that the disclosure will affect the feelings of the Chinese side. The Dalian Manchuria Newspaper reported on March 21 that the matter of planning for Shanghai as a free port had been in progress before the incident, but it ultimately failed. According to the latest news revealed by the American 工 Conference, due to the incident, it is increasingly felt that there is a need to establish a strong municipal government and maintain security organs. The foreign residents of various countries are now advocating the hope of dividing it into a free port and are carrying out various plans for this policy. It is heard that foreign residents from ten countries, including England, America, France, Germany, Russia, Italy, Portugal, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Japan, have elected 20 members and selected 7 special members from among them to form a small committee. On the 14th, when the League of Nations Investigation Committee arrived in Shanghai, the third small committee was held at the French Club to discuss its plan outline. The English members are Harris and two others. The Japanese members are the general director of the China Spinning Federation, Tatsichiro Funatsu, and the head of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce, Kiyoyoshi Komeiri. The items that have been roughly decided in the plan outline are as follows:</p>
<p>1. The scope of the free port is within 20 kilometers of Shanghai as the center.</p>
<p>2. Recommend a Chinese celebrity to be the mayor.</p>
<p>3. In addition to the工部局, a strong administrative security maintenance agency will be established to sweep away all the dominance of Chinese warlords from the free port.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a proposal to make the free port a tax-free area, but it is said that this section will ultimately not be realized. Moreover, this kind of plan has no relationship with the governments of various countries and is carried out by the foreign residents of various countries, especially the French. Now, in consideration of the feelings of the Chinese side, it is extremely feared that the twists and turns of the plan will be leaked. It is said that when it becomes concrete, it will go through many twists and turns. This kind of plan is enough to show the attempt made by the powers by taking advantage of the Shanghai incident, so it is extremely noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Citizen Groups Recommend Representatives to Visit Feixindun Today</h3>
<p>Suggest five measures to protect the opening of the market. The Restoration Committee jointly organized by the Municipal Federation of Citizens and other three groups held the second Restoration Committee meeting this afternoon. The Restoration Committee, which was jointly organized by three groups including the Municipal Federation of Citizens, originally scheduled to send representatives to the Public Concession工部局 and Director-General Feixindun at 10:00 am yesterday to discuss measures to protect the opening of the market. The trip was temporarily canceled and changed to 11:00 am today to suggest five protection measures. The second Restoration Committee meeting will be held at the Municipal Federation of Citizens at 4:00 pm today. The original letter to Feixindun is recorded below: Dear Sir, Since January 28, after the Japanese Consul in Shanghai accepted the satisfactory reply from the Mayor of Shanghai, the Japanese army again betrayed its faith in the middle of the night and used troops to act recklessly. Not only the soldiers and civilians in Zhabei were targeted by its artillery fire, but the citizens of the concession also suffered the tragedy of being arrested, beaten, insulted, and killed. Even British and American officials, male and female foreign residents were not spared. Later, it captured the police station and trampled on the administration, causing both Chinese and Western police to be disarmed and threatened abnormally, losing the freedom of their administrative powers. Therefore, the glorious history of the Concession for 80 years, in which your bureau painstakingly built and maintained the authority of security, has fallen into an unfortunate situation. The tax-paying Chinese merchants in the city have suffered greatly from the environmental oppression and have closed their doors and suspended business, waiting for rescue. Today, although the police power in Hongkou has gradually recovered, the dangerous situation still exists. This is not enough to achieve stability without assisting your bureau and increasing security. In view of this, our association has already persuaded all members of the city to risk opening the market on April 1, expressing their spirit of struggle to seek the reality of cooperation. However, after the market opens, whether the Chinese merchants in the Hongkou area can operate safely and whether it is considered that there is absolutely no danger, we dare not decide on our own in light of past events. Now we have specially recommended Mr. Jiang Yi, Qu Zhenhua, and Zhou Fuzhang as representatives to put forward the following suggestions and ask your bureau to show your reply separately. If these suggestions can be implemented, not only can the current concerns of Chinese merchants be relieved, but also a sufficient foundation can be obtained for the industrial and commercial industries involving international relations. The five suggestions are as follows: (1) Please respect the rights of each store in the Hongkou area under the obligation to pay taxes, and try to make the Japanese soldiers withdraw as soon as possible and give them full protection, so that each store can safely open the market. The same attention should be paid to other areas. (2) Before the Japanese soldiers have withdrawn, please increase the posts of Chinese and Western police and the International Volunteer Corps at the locations where the Japanese soldiers are stationed and patrol to prevent worrying events. (2) Please respect the rights of Chinese taxpayers under their obligations and properly plan for the damages suffered by Chinese taxpayers. (4) Please do your best to rescue the citizens who have been detained by the Japanese army and have not been released from danger. (5) Please properly plan for the security plan that is sufficient to cope with the abnormal situation and protect the safety of all Chinese and foreign taxpayers in the city. Regarding this point, our association is in the position of taxpayers who should share the responsibility of cooperation with your bureau, and we are willing to fully offer our opinions. Please copy and show in detail the history of the organization of the defense force committee and the current implementation of the organization law and regulations for reference.</p>

If there were changes, a new form was completed. As of December 20th of the previous year, 4,050 investigation forms had been received. Before compiling the list, forms with identical names were merged to avoid duplication, and unqualified forms were excluded. This resulted in 3,896 valid investigation forms. After completing the investigation, an electoral roll was compiled, distinguishing between those with and without eligibility for election. This was announced in the newspaper on March 18th, following electoral precedents. Taxpayers were asked to come to the association to correct or add information before March 22nd; late submissions would be considered final. During this period, 15 people applied to be added, bringing the total number of investigation forms received to 3,911. Therefore, the draft number of the electoral roll was 3,911.

Of these, 3,906 were deemed to have the right to vote and be elected.

The General Assembly of Representatives will be held after all three groups have been fully elected. The date is said to be around April.</p>
<h3>Curfew in Both Concessions to Be Lifted</h3>
<p>Discussions to lift the curfew began at 4:00 AM tomorrow. Starting from 4:00 AM on March 31st, the Municipal Council will completely remove the curfew restrictions. The curfew in the French Concession will also be lifted at the same time. This is a method jointly agreed upon by the police departments of both concessions.</p>
<p>Recently, someone submitted a request to the Municipal Council to cancel or change the curfew restrictions for the convenience of the dockworkers to facilitate the return to normalcy. The Commissioner of Police reported that the continuation of the curfew was for the sake of order and peace. If its cancellation would not significantly improve the situation for workers, then he did not want to recommend its cancellation. However, if the Board wanted to do so, he would not strongly oppose it. As for dockworkers not wanting to work after a certain hour, Chinese near the docks did not want to go out because they were afraid of patrols by Japanese soldiers. Even if the curfew were abolished, it might not make them willing to do night work. A certain Director firmly believed that efforts should be made to restore normalcy as soon as possible. If the movement of workers gradually returned to normal, then confidence would naturally be restored. Another Director said that the Commissioner of Police's report indicated that there were other reasons hindering the restoration of industrial normalcy. The consensus was that these reasons should be thoroughly investigated by the Commissioner of Police. After discussion, it was decided to request the Commissioner of Police to formally seek the consent of the French Concession authorities. If the Defense Committee also had no objections, then the Municipal Council could abolish the curfew.</p>
<h3>Attitude of Money Firms After Shops Reopen</h3>
<p>News came from people in money firms yesterday that after the shops reopen on April 1st, the issue of business transactions must be maintained. They will proceed as they are able, depending on their capability. Generally, after April 1st, money shops with a solid foundation plan to engage in account openings and transactions with various shops. As for the issue of advance payments for silk and tea, they are afraid that their strength will be insufficient, but they will still have to find ways to adjust. They will roughly limit it to the amount of business transactions. Requests for advances and mortgages will probably be difficult to fulfill.</p>
<h3>Insurance Industry's Attention to Compensation for Houses in War Zones</h3>
<p>Households that have reported to the company should decide to handle matters according to the terms and conditions. After the Insurance Association received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce requesting a discussion on compensation for fire damage to houses in the disaster area, the association immediately convened a meeting of its members. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce with its resolutions. The original letter is transcribed as follows: "Respectfully, both your esteemed letters have been received and noted. After this Shanghai incident, our association felt that the matter was of great importance and required careful study. We immediately appointed a special committee to handle it cautiously. It has been decided that our association will inform each member company to handle the matter in accordance with the terms and conditions stated on each policy. At the same time, each company will inform each insured household that has reported to the company to pay attention to the terms and conditions stated on each policy in order to clarify responsibilities and resolve the issue. We hereby reply and hope you will take note."</p>
<h3>Representatives From All Circles to Visit Dai and Guo Today</h3>
<p>Presenting public opinion in the hope that the government will adopt it, the Municipal Federation of Associations, the Federation of Commercial Circles of Various Roads, the General Labor Union, and other organizations believe that although the representatives attending the recent ceasefire conference have fought hard, the Japanese side is still creating all sorts of difficulties. They openly demanded to station troops in the Zhabei and Wusongjiang Wan areas, and at the same time threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations, showing no sincerity for peace. The associations are deeply concerned that the government will fall for their tricks. They have specifically dispatched Cao Zhigong, Zhang Yichen, Jiang Junyi, Li Yongxiang, and others to visit the representatives Guo Taiqi and Dai Ji of our country at 9:00 AM today to present public opinion in the hope that they will convey it to the government and not succumb to their tricks.

<h3>Telegram from National Salvation Associations of Various Organizations</h3>
<p>Organize people's organs and implement the lifting of the ban on political parties. The National Salvation Joint Association of various organizations issued a telegram yesterday, advocating the organization of people's organs within a set time and the implementation of the lifting of the ban on political parties. The original text is as follows: (omitted above) This association is a collection of 89 public organizations in Shanghai. Since its establishment, it has been constantly anxious, observing the general trend of the world and reflecting on the inertia within the country, and personally experiencing the 34-day lesson of the Battle of Shanghai. It deeply feels that to seek national survival and national independence, one must not hesitate to make significant sacrifices and endure long-term suffering to resist Japanese aggression, which is currently the only way out. It also deeply feels that to follow this path to achieve national survival and national independence, it is necessary to gather the strength of the entire people to overcome difficulties together. Furthermore, it deeply feels that to enable the people of the entire country to fully utilize their wisdom and ability to cope with the difficult situation, it is necessary to clarify the significance of the people of the entire country, the methods of action, and the paths of effort. In particular, it is necessary to make the people of the entire country believe in the government that guides the actions and feel at ease to entrust their lives and obey orders in order to achieve success. Based on these two levels, this association believes that the political organization during the national crisis must be thoroughly transformed. On the one hand, "resisting Japanese aggression with force" should be stipulated as the national consensus to be observed by the whole country. On the other hand, a simple and reasonable election law should be formulated, and people's organs should be convened within a set time to organize a government to implement the national consensus. The local governments of each province and city should also organize people's organs at the same time to implement reorganization. Before the formulation of the election law, the ban on political parties should be lifted, and political parties should be allowed to coexist. All organizational groups that do not violate the national consensus should be allowed to operate openly so that they can devote themselves to the national consensus. Gentlemen, whether you are pillars of the country or backbones of the people, you will not lag behind others in your loyalty to the country. Please unanimously advocate and maintain the national destiny together. The spirits of the Yellow Emperor and the Flame Emperor will surely depend on it. Shanghai National Salvation Joint Association of Various Organizations bows in apology.</p>
<h3>The Joint Association of Various Organizations Sends a Telegram Encouraging the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Hoping for unity and struggling to the end, the National Salvation Joint Association of Various Organizations sent a telegram to the officers and soldiers of the Northeast Volunteer Army yesterday. The text says, "To the Generals and Soldiers of the Northeast Volunteer Army: The Japanese bandits have occupied our eastern provinces, and the people of the whole country cannot coexist with them. Your army has repeatedly thwarted the enemy's advance, preventing them from succeeding, and promoting the spirit of the nation. We admire your loyalty and bravery. We hope that you will persevere through all setbacks and struggle to the end. In particular, we hope that you will unite with each other, concentrate your strength, and unify your command in order to achieve complete success and shoulder great responsibilities. Our association and various organizations will do our best to help, and will not sit idly by because of the distance." Shanghai National Salvation Joint Association of Various Organizations bows.</p>
<h3>The Founding Meeting of the Association for the Support of the Families of War Dead to Be Held on a Fixed Date</h3>
<p>The Association for the Support of the Families of War Dead, initiated by Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Shiying, Wu Zhihao, Du Yuesheng, and Zhang Xiaolin of the Ningbo Association, has been fully prepared and is scheduled to hold its founding meeting on April 1 at the Ningbo Association in Shanghai on Xizang Road. They are currently seeking initiators and sending letters to philanthropists, saying: "The brutal Japanese destroyed international conventions and recklessly carried out military aggression. They occupied our three northeastern provinces and further attacked the Shanghai urban area. They drove rampant land, sea, and air forces, launched fierce artillery fire and bombs, destroyed our cultural institutions, and massacred our unarmed people. The strong enemy acted wildly, and both China and foreign countries were shocked. Fortunately, our national defense soldiers swore to resist, fought bloody battles, and fell one after another, repeatedly thwarting the fierce enemy. Over a month, countless enemies were killed. This is not only for the survival of the nation and for the dignity of the country, but also for upholding justice and maintaining world peace, and for the League of Nations to breathe a sigh of relief. The loyal sacrifice of the generals and soldiers has its great significance. The people should repay their merits and honor their virtues and comfort their loyal souls. Shi Ying, Qing Lan, Zhen Han, Zhi Qi Cai, Xiao Lin, Xiao Lai, Jin Qing, and others initiated the Association for the Support of the Families of War Dead to raise funds for the families of officers and soldiers of the national defense anti-Japanese land, sea, and air forces who died in battle. Differentiate between old and young, raise, educate, and enable them to survive. Collect the strength of the group to carry out the responsibility of those who died later. We have always admired your public spirit and righteousness and respectfully request you to join as an initiator. The initiators' meeting will continue to be held at 2:00 PM on April 1. We will elect executive and supervisory committee members. We hope that you will attend on time."</p>
<h3>The Meeting for Reduction and Exemption of Rent to Call a Representative Assembly on a Fixed Date</h3>

(3) The 33rd District Branch of the Citizens' Association sent a letter stating that before the method for reducing and exempting rent is determined, all rent during the war period should be notified to citizens to postpone payment. It was resolved to pass the motion. (4) The Investigation Department reported that rent disputes have repeatedly arisen recently. How should the association express its opinion?

<h3>Miscellaneous News on the Rent Reduction and Exemption Campaign</h3>
<p>Attention to messages from all sides in the French Concession. The various commercial joint associations of the French Concession notified the various groups in the concession: "Regarding the notification, according to the recommendations of the various commercial joint associations, the national livelihood has been severely threatened by the impact of the war on merchants in various industries. If rent is not reduced or exempted, the future will be difficult to maintain. However, the methods for reducing rent are cumbersome and require soliciting opinions from all parties and deliberating carefully before a decision can be made. In order to gather wisdom and benefit widely, we are now soliciting opinions on rent reduction and the methods of implementation from various groups and people in the concession. We welcome all opinions so that we can select the best and present them for discussion at the meeting. Please send your written opinions to this association within one week (address: No. 3 Xinleli, Nanyang Bridge, French Concession). Groups and tenants' associations that have already been organized should nominate responsible representatives, from one to three people per association, within one week. Tenants in various neighborhoods who do not have a rental association can also nominate representatives to attend and participate. The association will then convene a representative assembly on a fixed date to organize a rent reduction and exemption committee. Landlords who are sympathetic and willing to participate are also welcome so that landlords and tenants can gather together to discuss peacefully and avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, we notify the social people in the concession to work together to plan for it. I hope you will consider it." The joint meeting of various commercial joint associations in the French Concession.</p>

<p>Fang Jiaobo, Executive Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Fang Jiaobo sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Reduction and Exemption of Rent yesterday, proposing that public welfare organizations whose rent is used as a foundation should not be included in the reduction or exemption. The original letter reads, "Regarding your association soliciting opinions on the reduction and exemption of rent, I am very impressed with the collection of ideas for the benefit of the public. However, the reduction and exemption of rent concerns the fact that rent is used as a foundation for various public welfare, charitable, and school institutions to provide annual funding for social undertakings. They should absolutely not be included in the reduction or exemption in order to maintain the status quo of public organizations and avoid the interruption of social undertakings, which is of great importance to the majority of the people. They should not be compared with other landlords and should be excluded. I hereby propose that it be resolved by public vote."</p>
<p>Jin Bosheng's Opinion. Jin Bosheng said, "Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, citizens have been on strike for more than two months, and the business community has not yet opened. Due to the impact of the war, the material resources of various industries have been depleted, and the voice of advocating for the reduction and exemption of rent has been loud. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified landlords to voluntarily reduce rent and tenants to pay off outstanding rent. I believe that the actual situation of Shanghai landlords should be discussed before making a decision on reducing or exempting rent. Shanghai landlords are uneven, and not all property owners are millionaires. While there are many wealthy businessmen who own property, there are also those who rent land to build houses, those who build houses by mortgaging, and widows and orphans who rely on rent for a living. If they are not carefully considered, and all parties are taken care of indiscriminately, regardless of severity, and rent is reduced or exempted abruptly, it will violate the purpose of human mutual assistance and inevitably affect social order and peace. I believe that this is not possible. If you want to reduce or exempt rent, tenants should investigate the economic situation of the landlords nearby and report the results to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce truthfully. The association should hire economic experts and convene representatives of landlords and tenants to form the Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction and Exemption Committee, be open and honest, and discuss together. The results of the discussion should then be used to determine whether to reduce or exempt rent. At the same time, for those who rent land to build houses, can income and expenditure be offset after reducing or exempting rent? For those who build houses by mortgaging, can the creditor be accommodating and reduce the interest because of the decrease in rental income? Can widows and orphans who rely on rent for a living still maintain their livelihood? And the length of the rent reduction period? All of these are closely related to rent reduction and should be included in the scope of discussion. At the same time, find ways to solve them to avoid focusing on one thing and losing sight of the other. Shanghai's rent is expensive, as everyone knows, but the abnormal development of real estate and the soaring land prices, the sudden increase in building materials due to the preciousness of gold and the cheapness of silver, and the increase in water prices last year, the landlords have to bear. Tenants have not expected these difficulties. Ordinary people who use houses to make a profit only get four or five percent per month, which is less than the fixed deposit of a general bank. Moreover, the interest paid to the bank by those who mortgage is lightly eight or nine percent per month, and heavily one, two, or three percent. The commission and transfer fees at the time of the mortgage are all complicated procedures that tenants may not know deeply. If you were to change places, what would tenants do? Bosheng is neither a big landlord nor a real estate businessman. He does not intend to flatter the landlord and make things difficult for the tenant. From a purely third-party position, he expresses a few views with an impartial attitude for the reference of the gentlemen of society. I hope that the Ming Dynasty will give guidance. Jin Bosheng."</p>
<p>Fuyuantang. All tenants of the De Xing, Zhi Zhong, Li Xian and other neighborhoods owned by Fuyuantang in the French Concession are now watching and not paying due to the rent reduction and exemption movement. However, the coffins needed for the burial and collection of corpses handled by the hall and the various charitable Confucian fees are very expensive. Since donations are not collected, they rely entirely on the rent collected. Therefore, the party resolved to notify all tenants yesterday to stimulate their conscience and quickly pay the rent owed in full to benefit the righteous deeds.</p>
<h3>Jiading People Prevent Illegal Organizations</h3>
<p>The Expression of the Youth Culture Promotion Association. The Jiading Youth Culture Promotion Association's Letter to the Elders and Countrymen of the Township and the National People: All elders and countrymen of the township and the national people, Greetings, (omitted above). From January 28th to March 3rd, after our loyal and brave 19th Route Army withdrew its troops due to the cut off of reinforcements, the counties of Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan, which were adjacent to Shanghai, were all covered by the war god's fire. Among these three counties, Jiading suffered the most damage. It has already fallen completely into enemy hands. The 200,000 people of our county were caught off guard and unable to escape. Most of them were killed by swords and arrows. Even if they were lucky enough to escape, couples were separated, fathers and sons were scattered, young and strong were killed on the road, and the old and weak cried out for help without being rescued. The situation was so painful that Zheng Xia could not describe it. Alas, who is actually doing this? Who caused it? This is all the tyranny of Japanese imperialism and the result of our government's non-resistance. Those gentlemen take profit as a prerequisite and treat the country as a child's play. Our beloved elders and countrymen, what do you think of them? Anyone with a little conscience must be filled with indignation and can even be restrained. However, after the fall of the Northeast, there were Zhang Jinghui and Xi Qia, who welcomed the enemy and joined the enemy. Following them, there was Ma Zhanshan's loss of integrity. These traitors of the nation and country must be abandoned by anyone with a little conscience and despised by mankind. Once I think of my millions of innocent compatriots who died under the iron hooves of the strong enemy, I feel that the killing of these tigers is not enough to compensate for their crimes. Alas, my Jiading County has been lost for more than 20 days. My elders and villagers have nowhere to return. The so-called country has not perished but the family has been broken, which is painful to say. However, the association firmly believes that our staunch and well-known villagers, even if the entire county does not leave an inch of grass, will never want to see the likes of Zhang Jinghui and Xi Qia revive in Lian Water. If there are such puppet organizations that borrow names and use clever words, the association is willing to follow the elders of the township with sincere enthusiasm and public attitude and jointly and severely sanction them. In short, we would rather the family perish than the country be broken. Even if the country is broken, we must make our Chinese nation leave a long-lasting splendor in the world. I hereby sincerely urge my elders and countrymen and the national people to be cautious. I hereby declare, please be understanding.</p>
<h3>Volunteer Army Zhu Wenzhen Inspects Troops</h3>
<p>The National Salvation Volunteer Army has been established for over a month. During the most intense battles, the first and fourth echelons, led by Yao Gang and Wang Kedong, joined the front lines and achieved significant results. Currently, several units of this army remain, stationed around a certain area. It is reported that Zhu Wenzhen, the army's deputy commander, personally inspected them. The morale of the soldiers is very high, and they all vow to act as vanguards and fight to the death against the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Yong Bao Sends Funds to Comfort Troops</h3>
<p>The Tianjin Yong Bao newspaper has raised 3,000 yuan in foreign currency to comfort the 19th Route Army. The funds were remitted to Shanghai yesterday and will be handed over to the army.</p>
<h3>International High-Level Target Shooting Championship</h3>
<p>Sixteen Chinese and Western marksmen participate; Li Gongying is the favorite.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fan Bai Lian movement and others have been affected by the war and have announced their cancellation one after another. Only the international high-level target shooting championship continues its program. Sixteen top Chinese and Western marksmen are participating. The competition began the other evening at the Shanghai Amateur Shooting Association. This may be the first sign of sports life emerging after a long period of dormancy.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Marksmen Gather. This competition has a long history in Shanghai and is organized by the Shanghai Amateur Shooting Association. The fact that it can still operate during the war is due to its solid foundation. Sixteen marksmen are participating, all leaders of the Chinese and Western shooting world. There are three Chinese participants: Quan Gongying, Shen Lince, and Zhang Yingda. There are thirteen Western participants, representing various nationalities including British, American, and Portuguese. The first week is from March 28th (the day before yesterday) to April 6th. The second week is from April 7th to 12th. The semi-finals will be on the 13th and 14th. The date of the finals will be determined later. The goal of the normal competition is 1,000 points, and the goal of the finals is 2,000 points; the first to reach the goal wins.</p>
<p>Li Gongying is Expected to Win. The association was originally a general organization for foreign shooting enthusiasts. Chinese participation began in 1928. The year before last, Li Gongying defeated all competitors and won first place, marking the first time a Chinese person dominated Shanghai target shooting. Last year, Li had a minor illness and was defeated by his strong opponent, Medina. He came in second place. He has been training diligently this year to avenge his defeat. His shooting skills have improved. Last week, he scored 173 points with one hand, amazing the audience. This year, he is likely to win. However, the reigning champion, Medina of Portugal, and Bernal of England, as well as Shen Lince of China, also have a chance of winning. However, Li Gongying is the favorite, as he is expected to win by the public.</p>
<p>Shen and Li Gain an Advantage in the First Round. The first week of the competition began at 6:15 the other evening. Shen Lince of China faced Xue Xuemu. Shen's skills are usually better than Xue, but Shen was not at his best at the time, so the difference between the two was small. In the first half, Shen took the lead with 500 points compared to Xue's 397. The second half of 500 points was not completed due to the curfew that night. In the last competition that night, Shen also had the advantage with 864 points compared to Xue's 694. The remaining points will be completed another day. It is likely that Shen will win. As for Li Gongying's victory over Mai Xuerer last night, it was already expected by the audience. Li led the entire time. He performed even better in the first half (500 to 165), averaging 14 points per shot. As a result, Li won the entire match with 1,000 points compared to Mai's 427. He fired 93 shots, averaging over 10 points per shot. The match lasted three hours and thirty-five minutes and ended at 10:30 PM. Li's highest scores were 115, 84, 72, 46, 43, and 41, while Mai's highest scores were 34, 27, 26, and 23. From this, it is clear which of the two had better marksmanship.</p>
<h3>The Unemployment Relief Committee Started Surveying and Registering Yesterday</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Unemployment Relief Committee," organized by the Shanghai Social Bureau and seventeen vocational groups, was formally established the day before yesterday. Because factories are resuming operations, the committee began surveying and registering the unemployed yesterday. The city has been divided into six districts: West Shanghai, East Shanghai, South Shanghai, Zhabei, Wusong, and Pudong. An unemployment registration form has been created and will be filled out soon to assess the situation and provide relief.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Workers of Japanese Cotton Mills in East Shanghai Request Relief</h3>
<p>The authorities have a relief plan. A meeting will be held this Friday. The East Shanghai Cotton Mill Union has over 30,000 members from Japanese cotton mills. Due to the mills' voluntary shutdown, these workers have been unemployed for two months. Besides those who have returned to their hometowns or temporarily moved elsewhere, about 17,000 remain in Shanghai. Assuming an average of four people per family, this amounts to about 70,000 people. Because they are located in the Yangshupu Road, Pingliang Road, and Huade Road area, which is within the Japanese military sphere of influence, these unemployed workers are suffering even more from hunger and cold than those in other districts. Last month, the executive committee of the East Shanghai Cotton Mill Union decided to send ten executive committee members, including Cheng Deyuan, Hu Boquan, Deng Hongming, Cai Linchuan, Wei Shudong, Zhou Mingru, Xuan Tianxing, Zhang Qingwu, Bao Ziheng, and Zhang Weisheng, as well as over thirty representatives from twelve Japanese cotton mills, including Gongda, Yufeng, Dakang, Tongxing, Donghua, and Shanghai, to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Social Bureau, the Shanghai War Zone Unemployment Relief Association, and the heads of various charitable organizations to request relief. As of yesterday, a proper relief plan has been determined and will be implemented soon. In order to provide relief to the unemployed workers as soon as possible, the association has not only requested the above-mentioned organizations and charitable organizations to expedite the process, but also scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees and representatives of the twelve Japanese cotton mills for 2:00 PM this Friday to discuss current coping strategies and the progress of relief efforts in the future.</p>
<h3>Losses of the Business School of Central University</h3>
<p>About 1,040,000 Yuan. The original site of the Business School of Central University was near Jiangwan. Since the Zhabei battle on January 28th, the faculty and students of the college only managed to bring important documents and fled to Shanghai hastily. The rest of the books and equipment could not be taken out due to traffic interruptions. Afterwards, as the battle line expanded, the college was under artillery fire, and then occupied by the Japanese army, who burned all the college's houses, books, school equipment, and utensils. Fortunately, Xu Peikun, the dean of the college, had rented houses in the concession and started classes. Now, after all the school buildings have been lost, estimated at about 1,047,000 yuan, he has prepared a list and sent it to Shanghai Mayor Wu to request that the Japanese side be protested against and demanded compensation. He also submitted a report to the Ministry of Education to argue his case and requested that funds be allocated to rebuild the college to restore its former appearance. It is also reported that the Business School suffered the greatest loss in this war, namely the collection of more than 40,000 books, including old Song and Ming versions of Western books, and books on commerce, economics, and other subjects.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Private Electric Power Union Petitions for Reduction of National Crisis Surtax for Users</h3>
<p>Although the donation is taken from users, it shakes the electric power industry itself. The Zhejiang Private Electric Power Union, located at No. 11, A Block, Jiujiang Road, recently stated that the Zhejiang Provincial Government decided to collect a special national crisis surtax of 2/10 of the business income from electric lights and telephones. According to the industry, this special donation, although taken from users, seems to have nothing to do with the operators of our electric power industry, but the users increase the huge burden, and therefore engage in contraction, power outages, and machine dismantling. It is inevitable that under the current financial stagnation and market depression, even without this special donation, it is already difficult to support. If a national crisis surtax of 2/10 is added, the impact on our electric power industry itself would be disastrous, and it will inevitably lead to mutual destruction. Moreover, the electric power industry is a people-oriented industry, and it is closely related to local transportation, public security, and the basic driving force of industry. It is by no means comparable to general luxury goods or consumer goods industries. The categorization is mixed and the reasoning is unfair. The whole province is shocked and puzzled. The association submitted separate reports to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Construction Committee, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, the Finance Department, and the Construction Department to explain the difficulties and call for a reduction in order to maintain the electric power industry. Fearing that the provincial plan is about to be implemented, the situation is urgent, so it held a temporary members' meeting in Hangzhou the day before yesterday. All Zhejiang electric power members attended the meeting to discuss. Everyone said that it would hinder the company itself to bear the donation from the users. However, for the sake of national crisis relief, it is better to donate automatically, collect the amount and report it. After the meeting, it was decided that each representative would go to the Construction Department and Finance Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to petition, and submit the petition. All officials should comply with public sentiment and take good care of the future.</p>
<h3>Pu Song District Municipal Committee Asks for Leave</h3>
<p>Chen Yafu, a member of the Municipal Committee of the Pu Song District of this city, has been extremely enthusiastic about municipal facilities and social undertakings. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, he has been running around and handling rescue and relief work with tireless effort. This time, the National Government convened a National Crisis Conference, and Chen was hired as a member. Because the conference is urgent, he will leave soon, so he specifically requested leave from the Municipal Government from April 1st for a period of one month in order to attend the meeting. All the duties of the Municipal Committee member were specially delegated to Mr. Wang Tongfu to act as his agent. It is also reported that Mr. Chen has prepared several proposals to cope with the national crisis and long-term resistance, and the content is very detailed and comprehensive.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Land Bureau Announces That Owners Should Collect Land Certificates and Sales Contracts Stored in the Bureau</h3>
<p>People in Caojing, Jiangwan, Yinhang, South Shanghai, and Zhenru should pay attention. The Municipal Land Bureau, in order to sort out the household owners, sometimes has land disputes, so it holds land deeds and other documents, and re-measures them all and exchanges them for land business licenses on file. However, according to regulations, the owner should sign the drawings of the certificate, and then go to the bureau to collect it after three months. It is now known that the bureau has prepared the land certificates for the owners in Caojing, Jiangwan, Yinhang, South Shanghai, and Zhenru districts, but because of the war, it is impossible to know. Therefore, the bureau specifically issued a public notice yesterday. All owners in the districts should bring their collection slips to the bureau to collect them starting from today. In addition, the sales contracts temporarily stored in the bureau when the previous owners paid the transfer tax can also be collected at the same time with the receipts.</p>
<h3>"Politics and Education" Weekly Published Today</h3>
<p>The purpose is to promote academic nation-saving. The "Politics and Education" weekly, edited by the presidents and professors of various universities, aims to promote academic nation-saving. Due to printing difficulties during the war, it was delayed until today to be published. This issue contains the writings of Cai Yuanpei, Hu Shuhua, Tao Xisheng, Han Yuzhu, Chen Zhuzun, and Kang Yi, and the content is rich, the writing is fluent, and it is both solemn and humorous, which is quite interesting. It is expected that after the publication, the world will be the first to read it. The newspaper's general distributor is Dadong Bookstore on Wangping Street, Simar Road. All major bookstores and schools have branches. The newspaper is wholesaled to refugees at the lowest price, which has the nature of charity and disaster relief.</p>
<h3>The Health Bureau Pays Attention to School Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau implements epidemic prevention work every winter and spring, which is handled by the bureau's epidemic prevention section. During this period of national crisis, although many of the bureau's administrative affairs have been concluded, the epidemic prevention work has not been slackened at all. Recently, the weather has been uneven, and it is easy to breed severe epidemics. The bureau has specially dispatched fixed doctors to go to the refugee shelters every day to quarantine the refugees. At the same time, starting yesterday, the bureau ordered a batch of doctors to go to the primary and secondary schools in the South City that have already started school to inject epidemic prevention needles and vaccinate.</p>
<h3>Wu Huanqing, the Savior of the Refugees, Resigns Due to Important Matters</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the establishment of the Temporary Refugee Relief Association in the war zone of this city, many compatriots in the war zone were unjustifiably arrested by Japanese soldiers. In order to save them, Wu Jun, who had studied in Dongying and was the general manager of the Bank of China, was specially appointed as the director of the rescue department. Since taking office, Mr. Wu has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese military to rescue and release them, totaling more than 300 people. He also led various charitable organizations in and out of dangerous situations to bury the bodies in the war zone. Therefore, he has worked hard for saving lives and comforting the dead. It is reported that he has been ordered to go to Liaoning for official duties and has applied to the association for resignation, which has been approved. In order to bid farewell, the colleagues of the rescue department have decided to take a photo at the Luo Fang Photo Studio at 3:00 PM today (30th) to commemorate him.</p>
<h3>Petition for Public Burial of Qian Gang</h3>
<p>Qian Gang's former colleagues, Ya Zi, etc., submitted a petition to the Central Government, saying, "Submitting a petition to request the public burial of martyr Qian, in accordance with the case of Guilie, etc. Qian Lieshi, formerly known as Gangzi Digeng, was from Wujiang County, Jiangsu Province. In the winter of the 15th year of the Republic of China, our army and Sun Chuanfang were in a battle in Wanli. The martyr was planning an uprising in Shanghai and was about to succeed. On January 16th of the 16th year, he was killed by Li Baozhang and died unyielding. The martyr was forty years old. Afterwards, on the 1st day of the 17th year, Junfu approved the funeral with the rank of major general and gave a pension of 600 yuan, which was received by Qian Kangmin, the son of the martyr. In April of the 18th year, the 7th Congress of the Wujiang County Party Department resolved that the martyr donated his life for the Party and the country, and should ask the county government to allocate land for public burial, and reported it to the Central Party Department and Junfu. An order was issued to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and verify the case, but it has not been implemented to this day. Now, the coffin of Lieshi is still in the Bing She of the Wujiang Reception Temple. It is found that the only one of Lieshi's posthumous articles, his son Kangmin, is still studying and has no power to hold a funeral. Now that the Party and the country are revitalizing, and the martyr has been martyred for five years, the deceased has not been properly buried, which is not enough to comfort the dead and encourage the living. Ya Zi and others feel sad about the old friendship, remember the heroic spirit, and although they are silent about public justice and private friendship, they should prepare a document and submit it to Junfu, in accordance with the previous case, and order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to verify and forward it to the Wujiang County Government for immediate implementation, in order to commend the martyrs. All the details of the Qian Martyr's body have been reported by the martyr's family, the former commander-in-chief of the Eastern Route Army, the headquarters, and the Wujiang County Party Department. This is also stated, and it is presented to the National Government."</p>

<h3>Foreign Sailor Causes Traffic Accident</h3>

<h3>Xu Shaoqing Moves Back to Zhabei in Vain</h3>
<p>Traitor Holds Sun Flag and Rampages. Xu Shaoqing, who lives at No. 34 Huangjiazhai Road, north of the Zhabei Railway Overpass, was a clerk in a foreign firm on Five Road. After the outbreak of the war, he took his family to the home of a friend in the concession to avoid the war. Now that the situation has eased, residents of Zhabei are returning home one after another. Xu also accompanied his wife and children and moved the boxes and other items they carried out back to their home three days ago. However, after our army retreated to Kunshan, the chiefs and police of various districts in the Zhabei area also withdrew, resulting in an ungoverned area. Thieves rose up, and a group of traitors, relying on the power of the Japanese soldiers, ravaged everywhere, and it was difficult for merchants to sleep peacefully. When Xu moved back the other day, the traitors saw the many boxes and clothes and were envious. Around 1:00 AM the day before yesterday, more than a dozen traitors, speaking with Jiangbei accents, suddenly came, each holding a flashlight, a pistol, and a Sun flag, claiming to be ordered to come and search for plainclothes teams. They knocked on the door very urgently. Xu had no choice but to open the door and let them enter. They tied Xu with a rope, leaving several bandits to guard the front and back doors. The rest went upstairs and ransacked the house, turning boxes and trunks over. They packed all the silk and leather clothes and gold and silver jewelry into a package and carried the stolen goods away through the front door. The total loss was 780 yuan. Xu had nowhere to report the theft, so he had to admit that he was unlucky. Yesterday, he moved back to the home of a friend in the concession.</p>

There was a difference of about 10 taels between the morning and afternoon sessions. Ultimately, prices steadily fell by 11 to 12 taels, with considerable trading among dealers. As for the silver market, the British pound fell while the U.S. dollar rose, showing divergence. This was due to the sharp rise in the British-U.S. exchange rate, causing gold prices to initially fall below 680 taels. Subsequently, price movements became erratic, but selling pressure intensified. With the Disarmament Conference still unresolved, there was a sense of unease and uncertainty, leading to frequent price declines, almost reaching 10 taels. At noon, as exchange rates eased and stabilized, prices rebounded. The morning session is detailed below. The opening price for May delivery fell by 2 taels and 5 mace, to 676 taels and 5 mace.

As London was still closed for holidays, New York silver prices increased further by 0.125, reaching 29.625 cents. Consequently, the opening price was low. Sterling was quoted at 8.875 U.S. dollars, an increase of 0.25. When HSBC absorbed spot contracts at 32.75 to 32.875 dollars, Hong Kong Yong, Ta Te Cheng, and others bought, pushing the price up by 2 taels to 78.5 taels. Heng Yu Yuan Mao and others then offered to sell, causing a decline of over 4 taels to 74 taels. Afterwards, various firms made frequent adjustments, resulting in price fluctuations of 2 to 3 taels. At around 9:50 AM, prices rebounded by 2 taels to 73 taels. The market then weakened further, with April U.S. dollar contracts trading at 33.125 to 33.25 dollars. Heng Yu, Hong Kong Yong, Yuan Tai, and others continued to sell, causing prices to fall by 4 to 5 taels within just twenty minutes, breaking the 70 tael mark. At 10:15 AM, prices finally reached 68 taels and 3 mace. Shortly after, prices rebounded to 70 taels. Macgary bought May Sterling gold at 8 pennis and 19.375. Many dealers engaged in stop-loss trading. U.S. dollar contracts for May and June were at 33.25 dollars. Hong Kong Yong, Yuan Tai, and others entered the market to buy, and short sellers took advantage of this to cover their positions, driving prices up by over 4 taels to 73 taels at 10:30 AM, before falling back by 2 taels to 71 taels. As 11:00 AM approached, exchange rate transactions thinned out, but trading activity appeared brisk. Yong and others sold and then bought back. Prices then rose to 75 taels at 10:15 AM, before depreciating again by about 2 taels to 72.2 taels. Retail investors then bought in, and Chun Fa Yong also made some purchases. From 11:30 AM to 12:00 PM, prices rose by only one tael. There were small fluctuations of around two taels. At the noon close, the price was 74 taels and 5 mace, a further decline of 11 taels and 5 mace compared to before the Spring Festival holiday (24th).

The booked prices were 68 taels for March, 69 taels for April, and 75 taels for May. The additional margin was 68 taels, and the price of red bars was the same as the gold price. Over-the-counter trading was reported to be smooth.</p>
<h3>Divergent Trends in British and American Exchange Rates</h3>

It is our ardent hope and desire that your mission will be successful, so that the major international danger in the Far East can be avoided, and a precedent can be created for the rest of the world to follow in upholding a certain doctrine. The Chinese people deeply love peace. We have always believed that international harmony is even more necessary today. Acts of hostility and discord between countries can only harm all countries and benefit none. We deeply desire to live in peace with all our neighbors, near and far. Therefore, even in this most difficult situation in the past and present, we have striven to be tolerant and have fully entrusted the League of Nations, because it is not only supported by the broad and civilized world opinion, but also the complete manifestation of pacifism. This alone can lead all countries in the world to a future of progress and prosperity. To enhance this friendly relationship and to ensure mutual satisfaction and lasting peace among all the signatory nations of international treaties, it is essential to respect the sovereignty of each country's territory and politics, which is one of the fundamental principles of the alliance. We believe that lasting peace cannot be maintained by military force, but must come from justice and good intentions to be effective. I sincerely feel that when I make this statement to you, I am representing the united sentiments of the Chinese people, and I earnestly hope that after your investigation, you will arrive at a fair and permanent solution, so as to resolve Sino-Japanese relations and preserve peace in the Far East. This will not only benefit China and Japan, but also all countries concerned. I once again extend my welcome to you." (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Additional Notes on Lord Lytton's Reply Speech</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo hosted a banquet for the League of Nations Inquiry Commission at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center last night, and it did not end until late at night. Lord Lytton replied after Foreign Minister Luo delivered a welcome speech, saying, "Gentlemen, I am very grateful for your welcome speech. We are very pleased with the reception given to us by the capital of China and the obvious attention of its people to our work. I have already mentioned this in my reply to the Premier of the Executive Yuan at today's lunch. I am pleased that Mr. Luo spoke so movingly about the loss suffered by the world due to the passing of Briand. There is hardly any statesman who has contributed more to international peace than Briand, and there is no one who has worked harder to strengthen the world's trust in the League of Nations than Briand. Briand was a true servant of the League of Nations. I remember a representative at a Geneva conference saying to me, 'Mr. Briand is the greatest pillar on which the structure of world peace rests today.' Now this pillar is gone, but the work done by Mr. Briand during his lifetime will not stop because of his death. He has enabled the League of Nations to properly resolve more than one crisis. The current crisis is indeed more serious, complex, and difficult than before. It has strained the principles on which the League of Nations relies for its establishment to the extreme and will be the greatest test of the effectiveness of the League of Nations tool. We have lost the hand that guided us in the past, and the voice that gave hope and comfort to countries in difficulty. Mr. Briand was the chairman of the administrative council that organized this Inquiry Commission. He passed away at the most difficult time for the League of Nations, but his work is done, and I firmly believe that the League of Nations will emerge victorious from this difficulty and show that it is worthy of the responsibilities it has assumed. We deeply know that China is currently in a transitional era of changing from the old to the new and is encountering special difficulties. The obstacles that Foreign Minister Luo spoke of that China has encountered in the process of unification are indeed unavoidable. China is vast and inconvenient for transportation, and there is a great lack of railways and roadways, so the obstacles that have occurred as a result should be impossible to prevent. But this difficulty, as Foreign Minister Luo said, should be given sympathy and assistance by friendly countries. This fact should also not be ignored in any resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. If the National Government resolutely fights and persists with perseverance, the difficulties can be expected to be broken, and the League of Nations will certainly strive to seek the necessary external peace for China to achieve this goal."

<h3>Soviet Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Completed Films About the Navy, Naval Personnel Visit Italian Shipyards Moscow, 29th (National): The Soviet film trust has recently completed a set of military films covering all aspects of the life of Soviet land and naval forces. After completion, they will be sent to various Soviet federal republics for joint screening, under the title "Our Preparations".

<p>Rome, 28th (Havas): Admiral Du Yunov, Chief of Staff of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet, and naval attaché Ki Longsoi, have recently come to Italy to visit the Triaelchito and Monfalcone shipyards.

<h3>Anglo-Irish Disputes Intensify</h3>
<p>Southern Ireland's Reply to Britain Ready, No Concessions on the Land Annuities Issue Dublin, 28th (Reuters): According to today's news, the Anglo-Irish dispute has taken another step forward. It is reported that Southern Irish leader Eamon de Valera has drafted a reply to the British government, which will be submitted to the Free State Cabinet for review tomorrow. It is expected to be sent to London by special envoy on Wednesday night. Before drafting, de Valera consulted with legal counsel, including Hugh Kennedy, who previously signed the Anglo-Irish Treaty. It is reported that de Valera has adopted a view that abolishing the oath does not violate the treaty, and that the land annuities issue is not within the scope of the treaty. The reply will state that, judging from the public opinion in the recent election, retaining the oath is indefensible. This is purely a matter for the Irish people to resolve themselves. It is reported that de Valera is unwilling to make any concessions on this point. It is unlikely that he will go to London. Whether his position is stable depends on whether he pleases the Republican Army. The pressure from the Republican Army, how long can he cope with? This is the question. Therefore, his position is also not enviable.</p>

If these two points are agreed upon, French Prime Minister Qin Diou will go to London at the end of the week to meet with British Prime Minister MacDonald to discuss all issues between the two countries. At that time, special attention will probably be paid to the Danube economy and reparations.</p>

<h3>American Attitude Toward China and Japan</h3>
<p>American Merchants in Tianjin Refuse Japanese Ships for Transportation Nagoya Shimbun reports that, according to a telegram from the Tianjin representative of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, merchants in Tianjin who export to the United States are now actively encouraging economic blockade against Japan and prohibiting goods from being loaded on Japanese ships. They have also notified the United States that they will suspend purchasing Japanese goods in the future. Japanese goods that have already been purchased, though belonging to third countries, should be loaded on American ships and Japanese ships should be prohibited from transporting them. Therefore, the export of goods from Tianjin to the United States, such as walnuts, buttons, and satin, 60% of which were directly handled by Japanese ships in the past, or transshipped at the ports of Kobe and Shanghai, are now greatly affected due to the suspension of Japanese ship transportation. This is because, since the China-Japan Incident, Americans have advocated using American ships to transport American goods, thus indirectly boycotting Japanese goods.</p>
<p>The American Far Eastern Association Pays Attention to Assisting the Chinese People Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reports that at the Far Eastern Association lecture held in Washington on the 22nd, an American woman named Mo A, who has lived in Japan for a long time and is known as an expert on the Far East, expressed her opinion, saying that the United States has been quite considerate of Japan in the past 25 years since the Russo-Japanese War, but on the other hand, it cannot help the Chinese people who are struggling on the brink of starvation. The United States should have a permanent interest with China, especially with the Chinese in Manchuria, to support the safety of their lives and opportunities for labor.</p>
<h3>Disputes Between Japan and Russia</h3>
<p>Involving Many Issues Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun quotes a Moscow telegram as saying that Russia has recently been quite concerned about Far Eastern issues, such as the establishment of the new state of Manchuria, the conspiracies of the White Guards, the Shanghai Incident, and various actions by Japan, and pays special attention to them. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently published the following documents exchanged between Japan and Russia: (1) The Japanese government, feeling puzzled by the concentration of Red Army soldiers on the Korean border and the construction of airfields there, telegraphed Ambassador Hirota in Russia to present a note to the Russian government. The Russian government replied that both sides should respect the Treaty of Portsmouth and hoped that Japan would not trample on the obligations of the treaty. (2) Russia suspected that Japan was secretly assisting the invasion activities of the White Russians, accusing the Japanese army of directing White Russian soldiers and organizing White Guards. The Japanese government replied to Russia twice, stating that it was willing to seriously interfere with the actions of the White Russians and strive to prevent political and rebellious actions that would harm the labor government. (3) Russia questioned Japan about the so-called new Manchurian state. The Japanese government then telegraphed Ambassador Hirota, declaring the principles of open door and equal opportunity. (4) Russia protested that the Japanese army was transporting troops on the China Eastern Railway and concentrating large forces on the China Eastern Railway, which it considered a violation of the Treaty of Portsmouth. Japan defended itself by citing the protection of life and property and made a statement to Russia at the same time regarding the relationship between the concentration of Japanese troops on the Korean border and the confrontation with the Russian army.</p>
<h3>Japan's Trade with Manchuria Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Breaking a 30-Year Record Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reports that since the Shanghai sea route was suspended, the trade of Kobe Port with China has turned to sales in Manchuria. The export amount this month has broken the 30-year record. The amount of imports from Japan to the three cities of Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin has increased fourfold compared to the previous year. Currently, 20,000 tons of goods are waiting to be loaded onto ships in Kobe's warehouses. On the other hand, because goods are pouring in from various places, warehouse operators are unable to accommodate them. Now, after discussions among warehouse operators, the Sandom Prefecture Kumazawa Trading Company, the Gifu Prefecture Products Exhibition Hall, and the Ao Cotton Textile Company, which were formerly based in Osaka, have been invited to Kobe.</p>
<h3>Hu Shi and Others Expose Japanese Conspiracy in Manchuria</h3>
<p>Report to the League of Nations Secretary-General on the Truth of the Puppet State: The Puppet Executive Yuan is Controlled by Japanese Kumai</p>
<p>Ping Telegram, 23rd Night: Hu Shi and others telegraphed to Mr. Drummond, Secretary-General of the League of Nations in Geneva, exposing the truth of the Japanese propaganda about the puppet state of Manchuria. The translated telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>We protest against the continuous propaganda of the Japanese side, claiming that the so-called puppet state of Manchuria represents the self-determination of the people of Manchuria. It is found that the vast majority of the people of Manchuria are Han Chinese. Pu Yi, the nominal leader of the puppet state, has never been to Manchuria before. All those who participate in this organization are suspicious former bureaucrats and warlords, coerced by intimidation and bribery, becoming puppets of the Japanese. The Puppet Executive Yuan is controlled by the Japanese Kumai, and each department has Japanese advisors. Since the establishment of the puppet state, the battles of the Volunteer Army in various places have increased. To regard the puppet of the Japanese side as the representative of the Chinese people is not only a damage but also an insult. It is hoped that the League of Nations investigation team can be free from the interference or manipulation of the Japanese and their puppets, and use independent methods to prove the true wishes of the Chinese people. We would be grateful.</p>

<p>Accompanied by More Than a Hundred Aides and Guards, He Gets Up at 4 AM to Hike in the Mountains, Expresses Deep Shame for the Current Situation, and Has Twice Firmly Declined the Position of Minister</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the closing of the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, Feng Yuxiang entered the Xuzhou Hospital for recuperation, and then moved to Mount Tai. It was found that Feng departed from Xuzhou by special train at 11:30 on the 23rd, accompanied by his wife Li Dequan, Deng Zhexi, Li Zhongxing, Secretary Wang Shijiu, He Chuqiang, Liu Chunde, Doctor Chen Chongshou, and more than a hundred guards. They arrived in Tai'an at 10:10 AM on the 24th. Zhou Bai, Magistrate of Tai'an County, Bin Zhaokang, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Qu Wentang, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, representatives of the Third Middle School, and more than a hundred people from various agencies welcomed them at the station. Feng originally planned to stay at Doumu Palace in Mount Tai. After getting off the train, Magistrate Zhou Bai reported to Feng that accommodation had been prepared at Doumu Palace, and all necessary items had also been equipped. Feng immediately asked whether the money used was your private funds or the money of the common people. Zhou said it was public funds. Feng said that since it is the money of the common people, by what right do you take it to buy items and prepare a public residence for me? I am here to recuperate, and no grass or tree is allowed to be used from the common people. Zhou Bai retired in shame. Therefore, Feng did not stay at Doumu Palace and temporarily changed to live in Puzhao Temple. Puzhao Temple is located in a mountain depression in Mount Tai, where cars cannot pass, and can only be reached by mountain sedan. It is seven or eight miles away from the station. It is a magnificent ancient temple, with extremely quiet surroundings. There is an old pine tree in the courtyard, whose dense shade can cover several acres. Feng's accommodation is in the east room next to the main hall, which is very simple. There are no guards outside the door, only a doorkeeper in charge of communication. People from all walks of life are generally not received. The Third Middle School invited Feng to give a lecture, which was also declined.</p>
<p>The reporter took a train from Jinan last night (24th) and arrived in Tai'an that night. This morning (25th) at 6 o'clock, he went to Puzhao Temple to visit Feng. At that time, the morning sun was just rising and the morning breeze was blowing. After arriving at the temple, he first saw Feng's secretary, Mr. Liu, and asked about the journey from Xuzhou to Tai. Liu said that Mr. Feng felt that the scenery of Mount Tai was quiet and suitable for recuperation. They departed from Xuzhou by special train at 11:30 on the 23rd and arrived in Tai'an at 10:10 AM yesterday (24th). This morning at 4 o'clock, Mr. Feng had already gotten up and was taking a leisurely stroll in Mount Tai, absorbing fresh air, and so on. After a while, Liu introduced the reporter to Feng. Feng's clothing was the same as before, but he looked a little haggard compared to when he passed through Jinan a few days ago. After meeting the reporter, he shook hands and greeted him, repeatedly saying very good, very good, and that he was honored that the reporter had come from afar. He then said that he was suffering from diphtheria and had recently caught the flu. The doctor urged him to rest quietly. He had recovered a little recently. The air here is very good, and he plans to stay here for a few days to recuperate and does not plan to go to Jinan for the time being. As for the position of Minister of Interior, he cannot take office in the near future. The reporter asked about his feelings about the current situation and how to wash away the humiliation and save the country. Feng replied that he could only express deep shame for the current situation. What else is there to say? As for the way to wash away the humiliation and save the country, I believe that first, we must concentrate the strength of the whole country to make a long-term resistance and never compromise and succumb. Second, we must send troops to the Northeast to recover the lost land. Third, the people of the whole country must exercise the ability of the masters of the Republic of China, automatically unite, and strictly supervise the government, and must not be complacent and accommodate. Only in this way can we wash away the humiliation and then save China from danger. At 8 o'clock, the reporter took his leave. Feng insisted on keeping him for breakfast. The food was only noodles and eggs. During the meal, Feng talked about the Shanghai war, which was extremely sad and indignant. After the meal, he shook hands with Feng and said goodbye. Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government, prepared to take the Taishan steel armored train from Jinan tomorrow morning (26th) to visit Feng in Tai'an for recuperation. It is not yet known whether Shi Yousan will go with him. (25th)</p>
<p>Since Feng is recuperating in Mount Tai, and in view of the difficult national situation and the need for time to recover, he has telegraphed to the National Government and the Executive Yuan, firmly declining the position of Minister of Interior. The original telegrams are recorded below: (1) To President Wang Jingwei of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, I respectfully received your telegram. When I was in Luoyang, I had twice written to request the appointment of another wise man to head the Ministry of Interior. Recently, my illness has worsened, and I urgently need to recuperate. I still ask you, sir, to appoint another capable person to the position of Minister of Interior as soon as possible, so as to benefit the Ministry of Interior. I am extremely eager to do so. I respectfully reply by telegram. I hope you will consider this. Your younger brother, Feng Yuxiang, kowtows. (2) To the Nanjing Luoyang National Government, I previously received a special appointment from your government to be Minister of Interior. Under your command, I consider myself to be too short of talent and too heavily responsible, and this is not what I have learned. I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to bear it. I have already written to President Wang of the Executive Yuan, requesting that you transfer my resignation. Although I received a reply letter of comfort and retention, I still dare not hastily accept this position. I think that I, Yuxiang, joined the army in my youth, and my knowledge is shallow. I am not familiar with political affairs. However, I deeply know that the measures of internal affairs are related to the safety and well-being of the whole country and the joy and suffering of democracy. Moreover, at this time of devastation and the need for recovery, it is by no means something that an unlearned and incompetent person like Yuxiang can handle. In addition, I have been ill for a long time, and it is even more difficult to accept this important task suddenly. Please allow me to resign from the position of Minister of Interior and appoint another capable person to achieve governance. I am eagerly awaiting your command. Feng Yuxiang kowtows.</p>

<h3>Common Psychological Errors</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Several short-sighted gentlemen, after reading yesterday's newspaper or recent newspapers, seem to have a glimmer of hope in the background, their heartstrings throbbing, eagerly hoping that all the news mentioned in the newspaper will be realized immediately. This is truly a dream, truly a big and special mistake.</p>
<p>What are their hopes?</p>
<p>1.  The Russian Soviet Army Committee's organ, Red Flag, published an editorial stating that the war between Japan and the United States to seize Pacific hegemony is inevitable.</p>
<p>Hoping that the United States will immediately send troops to fight Japan to the death.</p>
<p>2.  Mussolini commented on the Far East situation, saying that the Soviet Union will soon form an alliance with China and emerge to contend for world power, hoping that the Soviet Union will immediately come out to help our country.</p>
<p>3.  Japan's finances are becoming increasingly depleted, gradually showing signs of chaos, and the revolutionary tide is surging. The government has decided to take strict measures to crack down.</p>
<p>Hoping that Japan's finances will go bankrupt, and that revolutionaries will cause internal trouble.</p>
<p>4.  News from Japan says that if the League of Nations insists on implementing several resolutions on the Manchuria incident, Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Hoping that the League of Nations will actively implement it, and if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will make the world recognize Japan as the culprit for destroying peace in the Far East and the demon that caused the world war.</p>
<p>Although the above four hopes are not necessarily impossible, even if they are possible, they are like a morphine injection that can temporarily alleviate the current crisis, but it is not a fundamental solution. May I ask if any country can stand in the world of natural selection, survival of the fittest, by not seeking self-improvement but only hoping for help from others, and the self-disorder of others? Therefore, I call this kind of hope a hope in the background, which has nothing to do with oneself.</p>
<p>My hopes are:</p>
<p>1.  Our country will immediately establish a government that is organized, planned, capable of威 and resolute and brave.</p>
<p>2.  Warlords, politicians, corrupt officials, local bullies and evil gentry should not take advantage of the fire to loot and make trouble in the rear.</p>
<p>3.  Our soldiers must be like Brigadier General Weng of the 19th Route Army said, "Our last drop of blood must be shed on the enemy's front line to be considered fulfilling our military duties."</p>

<h3>Ode to the Nineteenth Route Army in Sixty-Seven Rhymes</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuzun</p>
<p>Everyone, please be quiet and listen to the song of the Nineteenth Route Army. The soldiers of this army are good men who have made outstanding achievements in defending against insults. Since last autumn, the eastern provinces have been invaded by foreign enemies. The generals did not resist, and more than ten sentences passed by. Jinzhou was lost one after another, and the situation was about to endanger Pingjin. Although the internal strife has temporarily subsided, the peace talks have been chaotic. The debate has not been settled for a long time, and the invaders have invaded Shanghai again. Many scholars advocate war, but who can follow empty words? The ultimatum came frequently one day. The central government has always been afraid of foreigners, and orders to retreat have been repeatedly issued. The Nineteenth Route Army will be withdrawn and replaced by Gu Zhenglun, so that they will not be criticized for not resisting, and everyone will protect themselves wisely. At that time, the Nineteenth Route Army shed tears like a spring. Soldiers must obey orders, and resisting orders will increase disputes. If they leave, the country will surely perish, and the crime will be even more heinous. They were in a dilemma about whether to advance or retreat, and the invaders had already arrived like clouds, driving their tanks and leading their tiger and wolf troops, occupying our railway station and burning our Zhabei, attacking our Wusong fort and killing our residents in the concession. They disregard faith and righteousness, and what else is there to say about humanity? Hundreds of thousands of residents are crying, and the sound is unbearable. Our army was suddenly angry and swore generously that it is our duty to defend our land and dare to love our bodies and relatives. After a bloody battle day and night, the invaders were defeated and fled. Shame and anger increased, and they launched a large-scale attack like a cloud, exhausting their sea, land and air forces, and bombing with three armies, saying that they could destroy our army in a short time. Our army was even more angry and brave, with one man against a hundred. The invaders were defeated again, leaving behind several divisions. They considered themselves to have defeated Russia and to be the only supreme power in the world, the first-class powerful country, and the army even more unparalleled. China is an old and sick man, and has always been known for its timidity. How can it withstand a battle? There will be no luck in battle, like a mantis trying to stop a car, like throwing an egg against a rock. How can they know that after dozens of battles, they will lose their troops and humiliate their ruler. Now the invaders have come in even greater numbers, determined to either win or lose. Although victory or defeat has not yet been decided, justice is on our side. The Japanese are like big thieves, breaking into a house and robbing people of their money. The master endures and abandons his property. The thieves then force the master to kneel and become a slave. Kneeling is still not enough, and they kick him in the head. If people are not made of wood or stone, how can they not be angry? I have heard that the army that feels sorrow can win. Our army is not for killing, but to avoid being cooked alive. I have heard the words of our army, and every word is sad and bitter. Calm your spirit and calm your mind. Cherish your bullets, one bullet for one enemy. When the bullets are used up, thrust forward with the bayonet. When the bayonet is broken, strike with the gun barrel. When the gun barrel is broken, strike with both fists. When both fists hurt, bite with your teeth. I would rather be a ghost under the gun than a prisoner. I would rather be a jade that is broken than a tile that is whole. (The above excerpt is the general idea of the Nineteenth Route Army's announcement to the soldiers) Its words are sad and magnificent, and can move ghosts and gods. The three armies are inspired and regard death as if it were nothing. They use this will to save the country and this will to save the people. Why should they be afraid of violence, and why should they be afraid of powerful neighbors? Enough to protect personality, enough to protect the country. Victory or defeat is common for soldiers, and even more so when a hundred victories are heard. How magnificent is the Nineteenth Route Army, enough to summon our national soul. The central government was moved and moved the capital to Luoyang, uniting with one heart to resist foreign insults and fighting hard without procrastination. Two hundred thousand national troops rose up and could swallow the enemy. Four hundred million Chinese people threw their whips and could fill the sea. May the bean stalks burn quickly to avoid eternal sinking. May brothers help each other in times of difficulty to avoid the destruction of children and grandchildren. I bow my head and ask you to write this poem on the sashes.</p>

<h3>Smoke Bombs</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Smoke bombs are used to conceal warships, buildings, or any military action, causing the enemy to lose its target. They are extremely useful. There are two types, black and white. Chemical drugs are loaded into the shell and exploded with lightweight explosives. The bombs can be loaded into any ordinary cannon.</p>
<p>Generally, white smoke is used because: 1. It is easy to use. 2. Its opacity is greater than black smoke. Its main chemical component is tin tetrachloride (Sn Cl4). A simple test can be done as follows:</p>
<p>In addition to the items required to make green gas as described by Zheng Jun, prepare a U-shaped tube filled with calcium chloride (Ca Cl2) to dry the green gas, a coarse glass tube with a diameter of about 15 cm or 20 cm, a long-necked bottle, two ordinary glass tubes, one straight and one bent, a rubber tube, and some tin.</p>
<p>First, fill the large glass tube with fine particles or strips of tin, and plug both ends with a drilled cork. Insert the bent glass tube into one plug, and the other end of the bent glass tube should lead into the long-necked bottle, close to the bottom. Insert the straight glass tube into the other plug and connect it to one end of the U-shaped tube with a rubber tube. The long-necked bottle must be immersed in cold water or ice, and the large glass tube must also be cooled. Then connect the green gas making device to the other end of the U-shaped tube. Gradually, a yellow liquid will drip down into the long-necked bottle, which is tin tetrachloride. Pour it on the table or ground, and it will emit a very dense white smoke (if the air temperature is too low, you need to heat it slightly).</p>
<p>This is because when tin tetrachloride comes into contact with air, it forms fine liquid droplets, which are not easily dispersed due to their high specific gravity. All the materials used in making it must be extremely dry, and the green gas must also be extremely dry and pure. Often, before connecting to the U-shaped tube, it is first passed into a two-mouthed bottle filled with water to wash it. If you do not use Zheng Jun's method to make green gas, you can use bleaching powder and sulfuric acid to obtain chlorine, which is more convenient. The chemical equation is as follows:</p>
<p>Ca O Cl2 + H2SO4 - 2Cl + SO4Ca +</p>
<p>Bleaching Powder Sulfuric Acid Green Chlorine Calcium Sulfate</p>
<p>H2O</p>
<p>Water</p>

<h3>Children's National Resistance</h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>The time was one afternoon, and the place was a foreign park. In this lifeless Shanghai society, I was able to see a magnificent nationalistic drama of resistance unfold.</p>
<p>On a vast lawn, a group of blue-eyed, green-eyed foreign children and a group of yellow-faced, black-haired Chinese children were playing and kicking a small ball in a chaotic manner. For some reason, a conflict suddenly broke out. The blue-eyed, green-eyed foreign children immediately stopped kicking the ball, gathered on one side, and contemptuously and ferociously scolded the Chinese children. One of the larger Chinese children couldn't hold back his anger and scolded them back. At this point, the group of foreign children who had gathered together issued a mobilization order and rushed to attack the Chinese children, fiercely surrounding and beating them. At this time, the other Chinese children also gathered together spontaneously to help the beaten companion and fought with the group of wolf-like foreign children. Although there were few of them, they did not show any weakness and fought there with all their might without any worries. One of the smaller ones was knocked to the ground by a foreign child, who pinned his throat with both hands, but he was still kicking and stomping on the foreign child on the ground with his small feet. It was not until the police came to disperse them that they dragged their tattered clothes and faces covered with red and swollen wounds, looking back at their enemies angrily, and strolling out of the park gate very generously and proudly.</p>
<p>Haha, I really didn't expect such a magnificent national resistance to be manifested in these few children: only these few children can bravely resist without showing any weakness or worries! Can you find a second such thing in this lifeless Shanghai society that has fallen under the iron heel? Can you find a second person with such glory and bravery in this half-dead China? Some people say that the reason why ordinary people do not have the same national resistance as children is because they lack the same frank and pure hearts as children. Here, I can't help but shout, "Long live the resisting children!"</p>
<p>Long live the hearts of children!</p>

<h3>Seeing Off Guests</h3>
<p>— Wupeng</p>
<p>Old Wang suddenly thought, "Master Li must be outstanding. Every time, almost every time, when I come out of his house, he always politely sees me off to the gate in person, sometimes watching me walk a long way before turning back. Am I, a poor man, worthy of being treated as a distinguished guest by the wealthy Master Li? Rich people look down on poor people. I think, I think, only snobbish dogs would do that. Master Li is indeed an exception to the exception! An exception to the exception!" The more he thought about it, the more he felt that Master Li was a remarkable person, and he himself seemed to suddenly become noble.</p>
<p>Once, Old Wang dropped his hat at Master Li's house. He walked a long way before he remembered, so he hurried back. But when he was about to step into the door, he was suddenly stopped by Mrs. Li's shouting, and he was embarrassed to move forward. He stood still and listened to Mrs. Li saying:</p>
<p>"I really don't understand you! What is Old Wang? Every time he comes to borrow money from you, you always respectfully see him off to the gate. Aren't you afraid of trouble? Aren't you afraid of losing your status? If I saw off a guest once, look what would happen! It would either "violate female virtue" or "..." I really don't understand!"</p>
<p>"You women don't understand anything," Master Li opened his mouth. "I have my own philosophy for seeing off guests! I have to see off Captain Zhao, in case something unexpected happens, he can help. I have to see off Uncle Zhou, because he has more money than us. Old Wang, haha! Don't look down on him! The more I have to see him off! I'm afraid he'll steal our things! Do you understand?"</p>
<p>Master Li seemed to have more to say. Mrs. Li also seemed to reply a few words. However, Old Wang didn't listen any further. Hearing this, he felt a kind of earth-shattering anxiety. He didn't want his hat anymore and ran back. Breaking out in a cold sweat, he seemed to be humming "Oh, I understand."</p>

<h3>The Terrible Harvest of the European War</h3>
<p>The World News Agency reports that according to German newspapers, a women's peace conference was recently held in Sarajevo, the site of the spark that ignited the European War. According to the investigation announced by the conference, the evil causes of the Great War planted in the city have now reaped their evil fruits. Sarajevo is the center of the Drina Province, which was where Austria and Serbia first opened fire. One part of the province (on the right bank of the Drina River) has fifteen electoral districts. It is now found that within these fifteen districts, there are 21,236 young people who lost their fathers due to the Great War, 6,185 young people who lost both parents, 8,735 children who became disabled due to the war, 9,826 people who are malnourished, 856 people who lack food, and 917 people who are mentally degraded. If we include the area on the left bank of the Drina River, the number of unfortunate young people will exceed 100,000.</p>
