<h3 id="c1">故宮古物之保存問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>翰</p>
<p>近來南北競傳之古物出賣問題。亦爲學術界極端注目之一事或謂處此國難重重之下。幾千萬方里之沃土。幾千百萬之人民。尙可斷送於崇朝則何有於區區之文物。今之齗齗以爭。亟亟以圖保存。誠所謂放飯流醊而問無齒决者矣。雖然。事有未可以槪論者。</p>
<p>夫此故宮古物。雖已成爲歷史上之陳迹。然而實爲吾國五千年來文化冲積之結晶。吾全民族精神之所依托。國家文物所薈集之菁華。後之學者正好賴以考究我古代之文學藝術宜如何設法保存。如何公開陳列。藉供學者之探討。興起國民之觀感。且故宮博物院爲幾經挫折。艱難締造之機關。諸委員負有保存國粹發揚文化之責任。今乃發生此飛飛揚揚之傳聞。誠令人百感交集者矣。</p>
<p>此區區故宮古物。從帝制遺孽子掌握中爭奪得來。幾經集議。幾次點查然後歸吾國家。雖巳成爲碩果之僅存。亦愈見其彌可珍貴。蓋近百年來我國家歷受强鄰之幸割。不但喪失無數可寳之主權。抑且流亡無數有價值之文物。歐美各國之博物院。幾皆有吾國宮中之寳物。僅英倫之維多利亞博物院所藏吾國歷代銅器瓷器等物。已琳瑯滿屋。目不暇給。上至帝王后妃。下至宮女太監之日用物品。莫不珍襲而藏。如乾隆之寳座。慈禧之鞋。光緖之衣等等亦視若至寳。凡此古物。或爲歷次侵略所刦虜。或爲帝制餘孽勾結不肖市儈所斷送。至於今日。以歷次刦餘所綴成之故宮博物院。竟亦有岌岌不可終日之勢。不亦大可歎耶。</p>
<p>按故宮博物院。曾以不還溥儀。不變賣。不毁滅。三端自許。信誓旦旦。人所共知。乃不數年而標賣遷移。物議沸騰。風來空穴。豈無因緣。而局内人則嘵嘵爭辯。謂所標賣者。爲無關文化之物品。所處分者有合法會議與章程之根據。惟所謂無關文化之鑒别。究以何法爲標準。實一至難解决之問題。而所謂會議之召集。是否皆有法定人數。今亦成一疑問。而况同爲委員。同負保管之連帶責任。乃或則斷然而行處分之權。或則有從未出席會議之聲明。此無怪疑謗叢生。莫可洗刷也。</p>
<p>再退　步言。即使標賣一事。有監委章程爲依據。但細按章程所載。可以處分之物品。一則爲無關文化之性質。再則爲詳細之列舉。今在所謂「皮貨藥材食品綢緞等物」之列舉中。並未提及金器一門。乃此次標賣。忽有金器一門攙入。當局初曾加以否認。繼以無可隱瞞。復在「金器」之上冠以「無關文化」之字樣。因此愈啓人之疑竇。夫保管員之責任。顧名思義。祇知保存。絶不容稍有例外。一有例外。弊竇即乘間而入。嫌疑亦由此而生。不肖者假借此例外之名義。以行其竄竊狗偷之術。初不過行之於其細者微者。繼則明目彰膽。公然行之於其鉅者大者。始之不愼。弊將無窮。至是負責者縱有百口。而亦無從置辨矣。</p>
<p>今之所傳標賣也。遷移也。尙爲其細焉微焉者也。將來難保不有人進而覬觎其鉅者大者。吾人今日而果欲爲永久保存計。使此數千年來滬傳之古老文物。勿再有所損失。則有關係之各界。宜先與負責者共同檢點淸查。一以釋國人之疑。一以表白負責者之心。然後再進而商議更嚴密之管理法。各界亦負共同監督之責任。切實整理。化密藏爲公開。庶於保存前途。或稍有希望焉。</p>

<p>馬占山痛告國人書（續）</p>
<p>溯自暴日以武力侵佔遼吉後、雖其代表芳澤屢向國際間聲明、决不破壞中華領土之完整、但其事實積極進兵、併呑江省之志、日益追切、初則利用張海鵬部進攻、繼則竟公然以護修江橋爲名、調集大隊日軍、進迫省垣、我方以尊重國際聯合會决議案、及非戰公約、竭力避免衝突、冀以保持世界和平、免地方之糜爛、并屢電我施代表提出國聯、促彼反省、乃封豕長蛇、得寸進尺、狼子野心、貧婪無聲、占山守土有責、遂不得不實行我國家自衛政策、以兵戎相見當時我軍義債填膺、人懷死志、晝夜戰守、氣薄雲霄、卒以軍械不敵、益之敵方飛機、日向省城内外居民抛擲炸彈、占山因　人民之籲請、並尊重國聯之公决、始將所部撤退海倫一帶、此已往與敵戰爭經過之事實、業經迭電宣佈、諒邀共鑒、</p>
<p>迨撤退海倫後、正在積極補充軍實、作最後之奮鬥、而哈爾濱之戰事繼起遂一面派隊堵截駐江日軍攻哈、一面以主力軍隊助丁李、計從此兩軍銜接、東西聲援、庶使暴寇軍力、或不得逞、不意我軍甫抵松花江北岸之馬家船口而丁李各軍、已不支而退却、日方偵知我軍援哈舉動、决計由齊克呼海兩路、用重兵夾擊、以期消滅我軍實力、當是時也、前有强敵進攻後無要隘可守、内而械窳彈缺、外而孤軍援絶、危急存亡間不容髮、占山自幼從戎、歴經戰陣、生死二字、久已置之度外、顧念死或重於泰山、或輕於鴻毛、倘驅我軍忠義而與强寇銳利充實之砲火相搏、結果徒供一時之犧牲、快敵人之心願、恢復之機益將絶望、反覆思維、欲解决自前難關、惟有相機應付緩敵進擊、庶可保存我軍現有之實力、俟時機一到、再圖反攻、並可藉探日人侵略我方之眞確計劃故不惜冒險趕哈、會晤日本多門中將本虚與委蛇之宗旨搪塞其間、而東北一線之生機、庶得保留此占山應付日人經過之曲折苦衷也、</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚狗的權威  瞻廬　　狗明星零了丁逝世的新聞材料，佔據着報紙上巨大的篇幅；吁嗟闊兮！可以人而不如狗乎？這呌做狗的權威。關於狗的光榮歴史，端的不可勝書丨有服務紅十字會，救濟雪中餓人的狗；有執役警察公署，偵獲鉅盜的狗；以及中外相傳的遇難救主的義狗，益發指不勝屈，似乎比着世上的義士還多。　　記得某種筆記載着狗的權威勝過了醫生：　　某姓所蓄的狗，因主人久病，狗也明白了藥性；每逢延醫贖藥以後，狗便在藥包嗅這一下；藥果對症，狗表示着欣喜，搖尾而去。要是，藥不對症，狗便狂吠幾聲，啣着藥包，丢棄在垃圾桶裏。主人虧得取决於狗，病便漸漸的好了，而不曾誤於藥不對症的庸醫。　　又記得外國雜誌上記載着狗的權威勝過了主婚人：　　塞爾維亞有一種異俗，凡是及笄的女郎，擇了春秋佳日，同席會餐；待到撤席時，每人把吃剩的肉骨，擺在案頭，嗾令狗來大嚼；狗先嚼誰的肉骨，便是誰先出嫁：其次是誰，又其次是誰，最後的是誰，一一聽命於這條嚼骨頭的狗，判定了嫁期的先後，誰都不敢有異議。　　我在這裏感想：要是，豢養的狗，都是這般，那麽，社會上不會有殺人的庸醫，也不會有反對主婚人的逃婚女郎。九一八之迴顧  徐柏庵　　（一）往事如夢！　　還淸淸楚楚記得：去年九一八日兵暴行的消息傳到上海時，我們正在學校附近的小飯店裏吃着湯麵，大家圍着一張十九日的報紙，緊張而又鎭靜，憤慨而又默然，在發花的眼晴裏跳出一個個觸目驚心的大字，什麽日兵砲擊北大營啦，臧式毅榮臻被擄啦，王以哲旅長蒙難啦，中交銀行被搶啦，……眼睛是非但發花，簡直要迸射着火星了！之後，便烈烈轟轟的開市民大會，成立抗日救國會，組織募捐隊，一切，一切，都在熱烈地進行，瘋狂地跳躍。　　（二）豈堪回憶？　　東北大地雖然給暴日的魔爪蹂躪殆遍，但全國萬千的民衆却正在用着最大的努力，冀能戰勝暴日和收復關外失地。然手握兵符的張學良將軍又偏不肯越出關外一步，在這期間，日兵又照樣來淞滬開始了一二八的屠殺，雖也吃過英勇的十九路軍士兵防禦襲擊的虧，但那些巨彈的射擊，燃燒彈的轟燬，炸彈的播送，閘北的火光，無數民房的敗壞，許多居民的慘死，財産的損失，…這一切，自然都是日人如鐡的罪案，撕毁不掉的暴行底記錄，然而也就是我們大中華民族難於煎洗的恥辱，因爲我們的政府究意缺乏决心，抗日的士兵終於因着後援不繼而敗退了。　　（三）目前如何？　　現在，秋風蕭颯，轉瞬又是九一八了，東北陷落於仇敵之手者，到今朝剛剛一年。而就在前三天丨舊歷的中秋節，那天的日本操縱政治的軍閥和資本家官員，竟在那裏悍然地，荒謬地，正式承認它一手製造出來的僞滿洲國了！這荒謬的舉措，國際聯盟雖也可以把它裁制，九國公約簽字國雖也可以把它糾正，但那是毫無把握的，在這年頭，除掉爲了自身的利害衝突而出面干預之外，是没有那一個肯做傻子出來講公理，說公話，把抱不平的。要救中國，只有我們人民自己！要收復失地，也只有靠我們自己的忠勇和犧牲！起來，心没有死的朋友們！起來！一致到關外去！枕上散記  火雪明　　琴絃的嘆息，劃破了沉寂的天野，我在醒後才覺到。但我依然躺在床上，一動不動，那一個朝鮮國流浪音樂師的眼淚，一定又在月明裏；向着故國的眺望中濕了雙睫了。　　這音樂師是一個啞子，他一天到晚不說話。但是他的情緒之謎，依賴聲音，會每夜展讀在我的心裏，靈魂襄，以至於無窮的廣大寂靜的海之酣眠裏。可是我躺在床上，没有一句話能安慰他，或者物質的援𦔳·「同情」只是不兌現的過期支票。　　我是病着，眼前黑雲在游。然而我的心像一條蛇，它盤咬在我的血液裏，我覺得痛。　　也許有一天我會帶着中國的琵琶流浪到森林和海的北方去吧？這時候，那啞了東方獅子便死了！石陳之死  維　　丨長伴湖山·一飛歸去丨　　誰也知道石曼牛是空軍中的一員健將，他的技術，他的胆略，他的功勳……凡留心一點革命史的人，大槪都有點印象吧！　　他是　個短小精幹的身軀，而滿具着一腔沸騰的熱血，他敢說别人所不敢說的話，做别人所不能做的事，他時時刻刻在求公理，時時刻刻在努力他的事業，以完成救國的志願；雖然他是這樣一個剛强果敢的人，而同時對一般人非常的温和·活潑像一個兒童，慇懃如一位書生。　　於本月九日上午九時，上述的一位難能的人才，從飛機上跌下來，腦漿迸裂而死了，他經過千險萬艱而不死，竟要到杭州筧橋而死，或許是命運注定的嗎？去年他由京飛到杭州來，首先到西湖上面盤旋，非常高興，他覺得西湖確是十分可愛的勝地，後常常對人說，「如果飛機掉在西湖裏，死了也是很痛快的，」現在他居然跌死在離西湖不遠的筧橋，前前的話，竟成了讖語！　　航空人員爲技術而犧牲，原是中外常有的事，可是石經過歴次戰役·平亂，討逆，勦匪，抗日，均不死，而獨死於普通的飛行練習，在九泉之下，終有遺恨吧！　　還有與石同殞的陳英士長公子祖華，他尙未經學校方面體格檢騐，要求與石同飛，朋友們都勸他先騐體格，將來飛行機會正多，何必汲汲，他說：一我如體格檢騐不及格，一飛之後，就可歸去「非常堅决，偕石登機，不到半小時後·就和石同遭慘殞·眞的「一飛歸去」！目擊兩個活潑的靑年上去，瞬息成了兩具血肉模糊的屍體，唉，我不忍寫了！偶聞  犬維　　丨進化問題丨　　在夜園中，聽到有人談到進化的問題：　　「………」　　「男女手挽手在街上走，在街上或人面前接吻，……旣然都是進化，那末，在公園中或通衢上野合，也是進化嗎？」　　「自然是進化」　　「未見得，恐怕是退化吧」？　　「何以說是退化」？　　「這不是同原始人類一樣嗎？地球是園的，進化的歷史，難道也是圓的嗎？」　　「野合將來合成爲最普遍的事，或者被稱爲最文明的舉動。」　　「那末請你解釋進化的歷史」！　　「進化的歷史，是一種螺旋式的，譬如一個螺旋，你認定一點記號在左面，等螺旋旋轉一週之後，你看這一點記號還依舊在左面，不知牠已旋進了一圈了，淺見的人們，祇看到片面的一點，而没有觀察到螺旋已旋進了一圈。」　　「………」說部扶輪會銀絲（十八）  江紅蕉（九）　　「你以大義責備我，勉勵我，我當然應該聽從；但是我所以有今日，完全是你所造成，飲水思源，我如何還有忍心，噍你受苦？你不能允許我的懇求。也許怕社會上以舊禮敎的觀念責備我，或者責備你，當然是一件可以考慮的事，但是在事實上，有什麽益處？我以前的妻子，你是一向知道的：伊的性情，完全與我不同，不能和我合作，决不是爲了你的關係。假使伊還活着而没有嫁人，我願意贍養，但是决不能再做我的妻子。我假使能努力報國，祇少要得到了你所給與我的安慰；假使你允許了我的要求，我敢賭咒，决不致使你失望而懈怠於我軍人的職守。芬，你該信任我的話吧？」袁團長說着，一膝跪了下來，軍人雄糾糾的氣慨，完全失掉。　　芬若被他窘住了，眞想不出一個方法，怎樣自己解圍。但是伊也自己是商量，知道自己的年齡，實在已過了再嫁的時代，而的確又愛他；假使再嫁，至少可以鬨動全國的聽聞，於他的事業上，一定還受極大的打擊；假使確實堅决地拒絶他，一定使他精神上痛苦得非常，萬一他眞的爲了這一件事而灰心，也足以使他不再繼續軍人的生活，於國家是少一個人材，也是同樣的不妥。現在他愈逼愈緊，怎樣緊急處置他呢？自然只有是與否兩字，要是允許他一個「是」，那麽他不幸的命運是立刻註定了；要是不允許他，他的不幸的命運也是一般的註定了。芬若左思右想，總想不出較好的方法，伊已不曾計較到自己的幸福與得失，只焦急着這一刹那間如何解决這難題。　　「你起來吧！我可以……」芬若說到這裏，忽然停口，立刻改變了思想。　　「你可以允許了」？袁團長當眞站了起來，喜極欲涕。　　「我可以送你一件寳貴的紀念品」。芬若說得很低而聲調發　了。　　「應該我也有一件紀念品和你交換的」。袁團長還是誤解了芬若的意思。　　「不是的，我是以友誼的資格，送你一件紀念品，你收受了，一定可以原諒我」。伊說着便走上樓去。　　了呆得像石膏像一般，失望得哭泣了。他想不到在這一瞬之間，局勢會改變這樣快，他無意識地兩手執了拳，向下垂直，又無意識地在空中揮舞，又無意識地敲了兩下在自己的頭上，又無意識地去取出腰間掛着手槍，他想在伊下樓的時候，瞧見一個情人之屍首，躺在伊室中，他又想待伊下樓，先把伊一槍打死，然後自殺，給全國的報紙添一些好的資料；但是他又覺得不忍下這决心，還希望着也許仍有一種滿足他需要的時機，得到伊最後的允許。</p>

<p>言九一八與八月半佛　　前幾天我因事赴蘇，所以這幾天没有與閱報諸君瞎談，即數日間投稿諸君惠寄的百餘封稿件，一時亦没有工夫拆閱，致勞諸君懸望，殊爲抱愧，　　我到蘇州，適過中秋佳節，所以在蘇州，大吃其月餅，惟我對於「吃月餅」三字，素來持反對主義，因爲「吃月餅」這個名詞，是何等不祥的名詞呀！從前軍閥時代，頗爲風行，有的軍閥，要到北京去「吃月餅」，有的軍閥，要到南京去「吃月餅」，有的軍閥，要到廣東或瀋陽去「吃月餅」，故吃月餅三字，完全是表示某軍閥勝利而佔據地盤的意思，　　中秋節吃月餅，本來是没有意義的，我國素用陰曆，則明月即可以代表我國家的光榮，而「月到中秋分外明」，又爲月的最盛時代，何以要去吃牠呢？中秋吃月餅的來歷，我不得而知，據說從前漢族滅蒙起義紀念，吃了月餅，可以喚起民族意識，這種說數，我亦不敢認爲信實，因爲蒙古旣不足以代表月圓，蒙古與月又發生甚麽關係，假定吃月餅就算佔了勝利的紀念，那末天天吃飯或吃橘子等類也可說天天在勝利了麽，　　并且今年的中秋節，更是不祥，是夕我國所見適爲月蝕其一部分，而歐亞等洲，亦多可見，是造物亦在吃月餅哩，日本帝國主義侵略滿洲，已經一載，而於今歲中秋節日，又爲日本認定侵客步驟，而開始承認一手包辦的僞滿洲國，節後三日即九一八事變發生之日，這樣中央，何等難過，月餅如何還吃得下去呢，　　故我的主張，現在我國陰曆，業已取消，改用陽曆，這種「吃月餅」之舉，也應該打消，若爲維持幾家茶食店老閭的權利起見，亦應該改爲「國難餅」不能稱爲月餅，不過這種國難餅，一年一度呑下去，也是不得了的，我們總要想個方法來，以解决此國難才好，文藝辛未中秋月食感賦柱尊　　廿年廿度中秋節，此度中秋恨獨多，深夜何人侵月闕，諸仙無計護嫦娥，平時貪享鈞天樂，今日其如亡國何，天上人間同一哭，憑誰收拾舊山河，壬申中秋感賦　　人間誰似此中秋，鑄錯何曾止六州，從此團圓都是幻，更無歡笑不成愁，江山普照無乾土，冠蓋相逢盡濁流，惆悵一年言抵抗，不聞諸將賦同仇，秋日次胡寄塵均　　臨風老柳尙搖靑，埀死寒蟬强唱晴，那解江山漸蕭瑟，不勝愁絶庾蘭成，科學怎樣裝置一個簡易的晴雨表紹良　　晴雨表又名氣壓計，是測量氣壓的器械。牠可以預先告訴你天氣的變化。航海家有了牠，就可以保全全船人的生命，旅行人有了牠，就可以防備不測之風雲，你若有了牠，不但是使你的生活極有價值，而且可以使你預先知道風雲雨雪的來到。由此看來，這是多麽有益於人類的東西喲。　　研究氣象的人，所最注意的就是氣壓。換句話說，氣壓有變化時，天氣就會發生變動。人們要想將這種變動，無論在甚麽時候都可以測量出來，那就要有這種晴雨表的裝置啊。　　牠的裝法：就是先拿根長約一公尺的玻璃細管，在其開口的一端揷個漏斗，然後把水銀從這漏斗慢慢的注入管内，逐出裏面的空氣。等到水銀注滿後，便將漏斗移開，另用手指緊閉管口，將管倒轉過來，揷入玻璃盃内的水銀裏，將手指移開，那管内的水銀便落下，落到水銀柱的高約七十六公分時便停止。再用個夾子夾住玻璃管，並在管的後面，安一個刻有度數的木板，再兩用頭有孔的薄銅片和小螺旋釘，將玻璃管釘在這木板上，一個簡易的晴雨表便算成功了。　　晴雨表何以能夠測量天氣的變化呢？這是因爲天晴時，外面空氣的壓力若減小，所含的水蒸氣若較多，玻璃管内的水銀便下降，這就是要下雨的預兆。天雨時，空氣的壓力若加大，所含的水蒸氣若減少，玻璃管内的水銀便上升，這就是要晴的預兆，所以能夠用來測量天氣的變化啊。　　玻璃管内的水銀何以能夠上升和下降呢？這是因爲玻璃管内的空氣被水銀逐出，水銀面上一點兒東西没有，完全是眞空。旣是眞空，牠的面上是不會受壓力的，所以水銀可以上升和下降喲。　　除了這種晴雨表外，還有種無液晴雨表。這種表是個圓銅盒，盒的上面，刻有度數，並用塊圓玻璃片蓋在上面，中央安有一根可以旋轉的指針。邊傍註有暴風，風，雨，晴等字。你只要看了那指針的箭頭，指在那一部分，就可以知道天氣的變化了。改良社會討論會改良送禮問題　呆　　在親友之中，比較接近皆而親密些的人呢，彼此在一年之中，總要送幾次禮物吧？尤其是舊歷的三節，端午，中秋，和年夜，眼前中秋又到了，所以一般的人們，又在忙於買東西來送禮了。　　送禮這個問題，我們如果說是要把它廢除嗎？覺得禮尙往來，自古有之，而且親友之間，不大見面的，一年之中，不送一次禮物，似乎疏遠起來更快，就是歐西各國，也有送禮這一回事的。　　所以我們如果說要廢除送禮的習俗，情理上怕是不許，事實上怕是不能，但中國人的送禮，無論如何，總覺得太虚僞而太無意味了不無改良的必要。　　眼前中國人送起禮來，專事揀高貴的物品，不切實用，使得受禮的人，覺得這種東西本來是不需要的，現在因爲有人送來，祗得瞎吃掉，或瞎用掉了。　　還有中國人在送禮的時候，每是差僕役去送的，受禮的人，對於僕役向例有什一的力錢，譬如十塊錢的禮物，到少要發一塊錢的力錢，在人們看來，受禮不是白受人家的，受了照例要還答人家，受十塊錢的禮物當然要還答十塊錢的東西，雙方在物質上一來一往，本無所出入，但送禮的僕役，却從中已得到兩次的力錢。親友多的人家，用人們一年力錢也要賺着不少呢！　　總之，我以爲我們在送禮的時候，先要明瞭送禮的意義，而送禮的唯一意義，就在聯絡友誼，表示尊敬。從這兩點上認定了去送禮，使不致於覺得虚僞了。眼前在我的意思，中國人的送禮方法，確是非改良不可。現在就我所見到的，先提出來和讀者討論　下。　　（一）東西要揀切於實用　　理由：有的人送禮的時候，揀起東西來，每是不管對方是否切於實用，總是濫送瞎買。這樣使得受禮的人，覺得所受的東西，不是需要的，不過有人送來，所以是瞎用掉的，這豈不是使送去的東西瞎廢掉嗎？所以送禮的時候，買東西第一要切於實用。　　（二）洞悉受禮者的心理　　理由：在送禮的前，我們先要洞悉受禮者的心理，對方歡喜什麽東西，便買什麽東西，比方他是一個闊綽的人，東西的價值，也應揀高一些的，儉樸的當然可買低價物品送去，否則反而會使他們不悅意。他如婦女用品，兒童玩具，都要適合對方的心理，送去才受人歡迎。　　（三）减少時期　　理由：眼前中國人送禮的時期，除了臨時不計外，大槪是端午，中秋，年夜，分三節送禮，我以爲三節是太多，可改年夜一次送，送禮的時期太多了，便會失却送禮的意義，好比一件玩意，毫無意思和價值。至於其他時期，如有親友患病或有特殊事件，當然要送些禮物，不過没有特殊事件，我以爲可不必送。　　（四）力求經濟　　理由：送禮的時候，我們所買的東西，也應力求經濟，不必要都揀高價的東西送去，使得雙方都不致浪費，因爲送禮的意義，不在於禮價高貴，而在於禮到心到，表示紀念和敬意。　　（五）親自饋送　　理由：向來我們送禮，家裏如果有僕役的，一定要使僕役送去，我以爲送禮非自己親送不可，否則毫無尊敬和親密的表示，而且自己送去，還可使受禮的人，省得出力錢，車錢而免得一般僕役雙方賺到意外的力錢。　　（六）打破酬答心理　　理由：在送禮的時候，一般的人，都以酬答爲重，有人送了十塊錢的东西來，隔不上兩三天，自己也送十塊錢去，所謂一拳來，一脚去。就在送禮的人，假如受禮的人，兩次，三次不還答，第四次便不會送去，在他以爲送東西去是希望，對方還答的而且對方的還答，是一種應有的義務，其實這種心理眞是萬分的廖誤！我們非要打破不可，總之，送禮的人，送了東西給人，便算了事，不必希望人家要送還，否則不如不送，委實太無意義了。在受禮的也不必斤斤於送還·物價的高下·時期的久暫，都不必去顧及，因爲我們隨時可以送還，而如果抱着一拳來，一脚去的心理，眞是無謂極了。禮物的價值，須照各人的經濟力量，也不必均衡呢。也是一種生路公共汽車上人　　「阿有啥位先生嘸末買票？」「先施公司，啥人下去？……」碩大的公共汽車顫動着，前進着，賣票人老是唱着這麽單調而有規則的調子，每天，每天，我都聽純熟了。但，這次，却有些異樣，確然有些異樣，牠顫拦得帶有些許悲哀和悽痛，因爲車上擁擠着，肩碰肩，背貼背，屁股抵屁股，簡直找不出一點空隙給我望一望這喊呌着的人。只有從人叢裏以十五個子兒伸去，換來一條紅紙票子。　　車輪不斷的旋　：乘客相繼着下去，上來，然而，數量，仍然保持着原有的擁擠；我，還是被擠在最裏的一角。　　終點到了，賣票的悠揚地喊着「靜安寺到哉……」人，從車廂裏流出去、流凈了，只剩賣票和我兩個。他，好生面熟啊！一個襯衫西裝褲背着沉重的錢　的靑年，他不便是兩年前同在畢業生歡送席上受人歡送的一個嗎？……我遲疑着，驚異地釘望着他：他，似乎有些發覺了，忙埀着頭，面頰有些粉紅色，拔脚欲去，我决然地趕着握住他的手：「密斯脫黄，您幾時來上海的？……現在你怎麽在此幹這個玩意兒？……」他只紅着臉，不勝羞澀地把頭埀着，我重問他：他氣短促地輕微地說：「兩年以前的黄ＸＸ·大致您還會留着相當的印像吧？那時我是如何的逢勃朝氣呵！您只看看這現在顦顇的面容，和蹣跚移動着的鳩形可怕　驅殻您·便能體會我這</p>
<p>Page 17</p>
<p>兩年來内心感受的創痛、和在憂鬱沉悶　蝕生命下掙扎的生活丨我並不曾怨詛社會的慘酷，我亦没有咒駡人類的殘暴，因爲我自己本身太懦弱無能了喲。其間：親友三番五次的爲找尋出路，總是得不着要領；報紙上公開的徵聘，我從不曾輕易放過牠，然而，屢次失望的結果，激振着受創的心靈，只徒覺得前途的渺茫和暗淡而已。兩年之中，我像熱鍋上的螞蟻瘋狂般地從上海跑到漢口，從漢口回到家鄉；到江西，又到廣州；新近又來上海。恰好其時公司裏鬧風潮，老賣票全部開除，友人勸我去試試看，我只好昧着良心去試，（雖說這是刦奪，破壞和摧殘老賣票的利益）意外地竟然成功了。我非意識地在此工作了將近月。有一次，車停在冷靜没有巡警的站頭，被老賣票將我拖下車來痛毆一頓要不是乘客干涉，現在還會和您會面嗎？雖說這不是人的生活，但，每月二十三元我可以得不致於眼睜睜望着沉淪呀……」　　他演述着，欷歔着；寫票的高聲喊着「六十三號，車子開了！」於是，他望着我若笑了一下，說聲「再會」，就背身到寫票間去了，社会的一角笑的意義吾　　大家知道，娘姨和娘姨會面，彼此總有許多話說的，在醬園的門口，在小菜塲，在弄堂裏，都是她們談話的塲所。那末我房東家裏的娘姨也不例外，今天我便聽着她和隔壁的所謂之「阿姐」在細話連棉。　　「不要這樣，」這是隔壁娘姨的聲音：「爲了有碗飯吃，還是忍口氣做下去，你想換過東家，天下的鳥鴉一般黑，那裏的東家不是一樣呢？」　　「哎喲，你不知道。」這是房東家裏的那位說：「你的東家待你還好，便來說風凉話。你曉得我的女東家眞是惡哩。一家七八個人，只說洗衣裳便是一天二三十件，可憐手皮都磨穿了，可是她不是說我洗慢了便是說洗得不乾凈。」　　「我何常不是一樣，一天也有十幾件衣裳，還要帶小把戲，還要燒飯。」　　「十幾件衣裳逄什麽事，我若是有你那樣好的東家我直喜歡得不得了。他們又不駡你，你要怎樣便怎樣，可是我家的少奶奶才眞壞哩；譬如一天忙到晚，到了夜裏總是累得要命的，只要一坐着便想睡覺，可是她們太太奶奶小姐們，却要喊你拿這樣拿那樣，一直要等到她們上電影院或是到賭博塲去了，才得躺在床上睡一下。但是又要半醒的等着她們回來，好跑去開門，若是不聽着或是走慢了一步便是一頓臭駡。有一次也是睡得没有聽見，我的太太大發脾氣，幾乎要打我一頓才甘心。」　　「不過，「替猪攤打算看錢面，」爲了幾個工錢又有什麽辦法呢？」　　「工錢嗎，更不要說起，一個月三元半工錢，到月裏還要問她討哩。」　　「啊！那眞太少了。」　　「哎！眞是氣死人哩。可是說又說不得，簡直是啞子吃黃連，苦在心頭。」　　「那末你現在打算不做，又怎麽弄呢？難道你知道那一個東家好嗎？」　　「不，我想要好一點的，并且工錢也要多一隻老洋。人也很少，至少衣服總可少洗幾件。」　　回轉頭來、我發現自己的房東也在偷聽，我無可言說的望着她一笑，於是她也一笑，臉上泛着一層淺紅，似乎已領會到我笑的意義了。公佈欄上海第一特區地方法院　　民事判决　陳詠滄等與惠泉浴室經理陳秀惠等存欵案（主文）被告應償還陳詠洽洋三千元莫肇芸洋二千五百元王金生洋三千元並自本年五月一日起至執行終了日止按月一分五厘之利息吳殿元等參加之訴駁回訴訟費用由被告及參加人等各自負担▲嚴葉淑英與嚴孟繁存欵案（主文）本案應移送江蘇吳縣地方法院▲葉彭率眞興沈巫氏等基地案（主文）本案江蘇上海特區地方法院於民國十九年十一月十九日所爲除權判决及同年十二月二十日所發之執管遺産證書撤銷坐落上邑二十七保十圖土名沈家宅卽公共租界新閘橋堍基地五分七厘四毫確認爲原告所有被告等在該地内所造之平屋應予拆讓訟費由被告等負担▲平治明公司經租陳宜昌與徐世文欠租案（主文）被告應償還原告經租之平治明公司洋三百九十元訴訟費用由被告負担▲益石生與葉永年欠欵案（主文）被告應償還原告洋六十元訟費由被告負担▲喊哩洋行與施少初貨欵案（主文）被告應給付原告貨銀三萬四千九百六十五兩九錢並自起訴日起至執行終了日止週息五厘之利息將所定之毛絨卅包及花絨五包出淸原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告負担▲姚俊之與胡開文協記申莊支付票欵案（主文）被告應償還原告票欵七百十五元並自支票到期之日起至淸償之日止常年六厘利息▲義記公司與鼎華綢莊房租案（主文）被告應償還原告房租二百六十六兩假執行之聲請駁回訴訟費用由被告負担▲祥盛米號與黃順興等貨欵案（主文）被告黄順興應償還原告貨欵四百五十六元六角並自民國二十一年八月十九日起至執行終了之日止週年五厘利息被告倪來根應償還原告貨欵三百八十五元四角並自民國二十一年八月十九日起至執行終了日止週年五厘利息訴訟費用黄順興負担九分之五倪來根負担九分之四▲三元地産公司與天中理髮所許士信等欠租案（主文）被告天中理髮所應償還原告銀三百三十兩又洋四十五元被告美最時鞋店應償還原告銀四百二十兩原告假執行之聲請駁回訟費由被告等比例負担劉楊蔚文與楊楚高返還棺木案（主文）被告應將原告之高祖楊桂芳及其高祖母胡氏洋氏棺木三口交由原告領回▲姜富祥與馬孝治房租案（主文）被告應償還原告房租三百廿元訴訟費用由被告負擔▲趙一新與陳德全因寳銀及賠償涉訟案（主文）原告應給付被告洋五百元並接收頂租房屋被告其餘之反訴及原告之訴均駁回本訴訟費由原告負擔反訴訟費原告負擔六分之一被告負擔六分之五▲唐美章與李寳慶欠欵案（主文）被告應償還原告洋二百八十元訟費由被告負擔▲李如良與李小金等欠欵案（主文）被告蔣和尙李小金應償還原告洋六十元此欵應每月償還五元至還淸爲止被告李小金應償原告洋一百十元此欵應每月償還洋十元至償淸爲止内洋六十元如不能償還時由被告朱老三代爲償還被告牛李氏應償還原告洋二百九十元此欵應每月償還洋廿元至償淸爲止如不能償還時由被告朱老三代爲償還訟費由被告等各按其訴訟標的金額比例負擔▲别新生與趙嘉塘欠欵案（主文）被告應償還原告洋八百元訟費由被告負担▲黃盛興號與公盛米號等貨欵案（主文）公盛米號應償還原告貨欵八百五十元時大鈞應負淸理償還之責本件不准假執行訴訟費用由被告負担▲烏鴻新與陳也橋借欵（主文）被告應將抵押物回復原狀原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告負担▲何阿娥與夏林生離婚案（主文）兩造准予離異訟費由被告負担▲李隆裕與應海籌賠等償案（主文）被告應海籌應賠償原告洋五百元如無力賠償時由被告沈燮堂代償原告其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由被告應海籌負担▲倪立懷與金炳生等房租及遷讓案（主文）被告金炳生應自本年九月起至十一月止按月償還原告房租九十四元如金炳生無力淸償應由乾坤和代償其餘之訴駁回訴訟費用由被告負担▲楊寳榮與劉玉陔等欠欵案（主文）劉玉陔應償還原告洋二千八百七十元及自本年七月十五日起至執行終了日止二千元之按月一分五厘利息如劉玉陔不能淸償時由夏純一吳章祺代爲償還訴訟費用由劉玉陔負担▲納勒近生與顧阿狗等欠欵案（主文）被告等應連帶償還原告洋一百五十元訟費由被告等負担▲張啟林與程阿寳欠欵案（主文）被告應代嚴士得償還原告洋四十元並自民國十八年八月十六日起至執行終了日止按月一分之利息訟費由被告負担▲丁柏靑與梁宇之等欠欵案（主文）被告梁宇之應償還原告洋五百元並自民國二二年十一月十七日起至執行終了日止按月一分二厘之利息原告對於被告天寳華號之訴駁回訟費原告負担十分之一被告梁宇之負担十分之九▲瞿寳生與唐孟璞欠欵案（主文）被告應償還原告原本洋一百五十元利息洋二十七元五角此欵每月償還洋三十元至還淸爲止原告其餘之訴駁回訟費由被告負担▲薩克與恊康恒主欠租案（主文）被告應償還原告經理之通和公司房租洋九十二元並遷讓出屋訴訟費用由被告負担本件應予假執行▲公益經租賬房與盛元號欠租案（主文）被告應償還原告房租洋四百元訟費由被告負担　　民事批示　張吳瑤貽爲執管遺産聲請給證由狀悉仰照修正稿登申新各報十四日如無人反對再行檢報呈候核辦此批▲吳發來等爲執管遺産聲請給證由狀悉查所擬公告稿内並未將該遺産坐落地點及該地畝數叙明仰卽補叙明白並將該道契拍照呈案以憑核辦此批▲金達三爲股票事聲請給諭過戶由狀悉仰將證件拍照呈案並擬具公告稿呈候核辦此批▲葛傑臣爲屠恒禮借欵案請銷案並啟封由狀悉准予銷案並候函知上虞縣政府啟封可也此批▲葛傑臣與屠恒禮道契案請銷案由狀悉准予銷案此批▲益豐洋行爲楊金棠欠租案請執行由狀悉本案已經上訴所請應從緩議此批▲鄭芝蘭爲周介收欠租案請執行由狀悉本案業已上訴所請應從緩議此批▲蕭冠南爲王梓康貨欵案請執行由狀悉本案已經上訴所請應毋庸議此批▲呂順記爲訴喬守興欠租案聲請執行由狀悉案已上訴所請應從緩議此批▲吳發仁爲訴曹善餘票欵案聲請執行由狀悉查該案判决尙未確定所請暫從緩議此批▲盧三記與例雅貨欵案聲請銷案由狀悉旣據債務人在外理楚應准銷案此批▲果門勒生與姚鴻森欠欵案聲請領欵由狀悉查債務人尙未將餘欠交淸已飭傳嚴追矣此批▲白利東生爲與張潤生等借欵案聲請執行由狀悉案已上訴所請應毋庸議此批▲顧其生爲與王順記等借欵案聲請執行由狀悉查此案判决尙未確定所請暫從緩議此批　　刑事判决　楊樹浦捕房訴張學開竊盜案（主文）張學開竊盜二罪各處有期徒刑二月應執行有期徒刑三月▲新閘捕房訴陳馬氏竊盜案（主文）陳馬氏竊盜處拘役四十日▲梁慶均竊盜案（主文）梁慶山竊盜處拘役三十日▲虹口捕房訴馬名豪等侵占案（主文）馬名豪陳根堂共同侵占遺失物各處罰金二十元如易科監禁以一元折算一日▲總巡捕房訴顧林蔭侵占案（主文）顧林蔭侵占處拘役四十日▲陳王氏鴉片案（主文）陳王氏吸食鴉片處有期徒刑一月鴉片一缸計重二磅没收▲新閘捕房訴王德明等賭博案（主文）王得明韓明寳尹四法羅長根朱雲長季長友賭博財物各處罰金二十元如易科監禁以一元折算一日竹牌三十只銅元十九枚洋燭一支骰子一粒均没收▲匯山捕房訴吳阿根竊盜案（主文）吳阿根竊盜處有期徒刑四月▲任興寳竊盜案（主文）任興寳竊盜處拘役四十日▲王阿榮等賭博案（主文）王阿榮周才如忻登來王如亭樂小品陸有良耿錫郎王阿淡趙梅靑鄭連慶楊元堂忻阿保江君榮賭博財物各處罰金五十元如易科監禁以一元折算一日一元鈔票九張現洋四元雙角十八枚五角鈔一張銅元三百枚麻雀牌三副均没收▲虹口捕房訴陳德明鴉片案（主文）陳德明吸食鴉片處有期徒刑二月黃寳善吸食鴉片處有期徒刑四月烟槍三支烟燈三只盤一只扦三支挖三只秤二付鍋一只鴉片二盅重一磅四兩均没收▲總巡捕房訴楊陳氏等鴉片案（主文）楊陳氏孔金小持有鴉片煙具處罰金六十元如易科監禁以一元折算一日裁判確定前覊押日數均以一日抵罰金一元煙槍二支燈二只斗一只煙灰一聽鴉片二小盒均没收▲新閘捕房訴朱成賢恐嚇案（主文）朱成賢恐嚇未遂一案處有期徒刑三月緩刑三年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲匯司捕房訴蔣高郎行使僞幣案（主文）蔣高郎意圖供行使之用而收集通用僞貨幣一罪處有期徒刑三年裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日僞雙角三十六枚没收▲匯司捕房訴吳陳氏等鴉片案（主文）吳陳氏意圖營利以館舍供人吸用鴉片代用品一罪處有期徒刑六月併科罰金五十元計阿四累犯吸食鴉片代用品一罪處有期徒刑三月併科罰金五十元李阿德吸食鴉片代用品一罪處有期徒刑一月併科罰金二十元裁判確定前覊押日數均以二日抵徒刑一日罰金如易科監禁均以二元折算一日▲戈登路捕房訴陳大新公共危險案（主文）陳大新未受允准而持有爆烈物一罪處有期徒刑三月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日火藥四袋計一百二十二磅没收▲靜安寺捕房訴張永祥竊盜案（主文）張永祥以竊盜爲常業一罪處有期徒刑一年二月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑二日小刀一把没收▲新閘捕房訴張士生搶奪案（主文）張士生搶奪一罪處有期徒刑六月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲老閘捕房訴趙福同竊盜案（主文）趙福同竊盜一罪處有期徒刑二月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲劉鴻熏訴周聿堃濫發支票案（主文）本件不受理▲匯山捕房訴張阿蕭公共危險案（主文）張阿蕭販賣妨害衛生之物品一罪處有期徒刑六月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日牛奶十一瓶没收▲新閘捕房訴王益成竊盜案（主文）王益成竊盜犯處有期徒刑三月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日▲朱鈞訴林金梅等傷害案（主文）本件不受理▲趙吳氏訴范三姑娘傷害案（主文）本件不受理▲總巡捕房訴劉福生竊盜案（主文）對福生竊盜一罪減處有期徒刑一月</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Problem of Preserving Ancient Objects in the Forbidden City <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>By Han</p>
<p>Recently, the widely circulated news from both the North and South regarding the sale of ancient artifacts has also become a matter of extreme attention in academic circles. Some argue that under the current circumstances of repeated national crises, even vast lands of tens of millions of square miles and hundreds of millions of people can be forfeited in a single morning, so what significance do these mere cultural relics hold? The current fervent disputes and desperate attempts at preservation are, in truth, like offering abundant food and wine while asking someone without teeth to make a decisive bite. However, matters cannot be generalized in this way.</p>
<p>These ancient objects in the Forbidden City, although already historical relics, are in reality the crystallization of our nation's five thousand years of cultural accumulation. They are what our entire nation's spirit relies upon, the essence of the nation's cultural relics. Future scholars will depend on them to study our ancient literature and art. How to find ways to preserve them and how to display them publicly, so as to provide scholars with material for research and arouse the public's interest, should be carefully considered. Moreover, the Forbidden City Museum is an institution that was created through repeated setbacks and hardships. The members bear the responsibility of preserving the national essence and promoting culture. Now, these rampant rumors have arisen, truly causing a flood of emotions.</p>
<p>These mere ancient objects in the Forbidden City were seized from the hands of the remnants of the imperial system. After repeated deliberations and inspections, they were returned to our nation. Although they are now the only remaining fruits, this only makes them all the more precious. Over the past century, our country has suffered the ruthless partitioning of powerful neighbors. Not only have we lost countless precious sovereign rights, but also countless valuable cultural relics have been lost abroad. Museums in various European and American countries almost all possess treasures from our country's palaces. The Victoria and Albert Museum in England alone houses a vast collection of our country's bronze ware, porcelain, and other items from various dynasties, filling room after room, a sight that one cannot take in at a glance. Even the daily items of emperors, empresses, concubines, palace maids, and eunuchs are cherished and preserved, such as Emperor Qianlong's throne, Empress Dowager Cixi's shoes, Emperor Guangxu's clothing, and so on, all regarded as precious treasures. These ancient objects were either plundered during past invasions or squandered by the remnants of the imperial system in collusion with unscrupulous merchants. Now, the Forbidden City Museum, pieced together from the remnants of past pillaging, is also in a precarious state. Is this not truly lamentable?</p>
<p>According to the Forbidden City Museum, it has vowed on three principles: not to return them to Puyi, not to sell them, and not to destroy them. These solemn promises are known to all. Yet, in just a few years, there have been talks of auctions and relocations, causing public outcry. If the wind comes from an empty cave, there must be a reason. However, people within the institution are arguing vehemently, claiming that the items being auctioned are unrelated to culture and that the decisions were made based on legitimate meetings and regulations. However, the criteria for judging what is "unrelated to culture" is a very difficult problem to solve. Whether the meetings were convened with the required quorum has also become a question. Moreover, all members share a joint responsibility for safekeeping, yet some have unilaterally exercised the power to dispose of items, while others have declared that they have never attended the meetings. No wonder suspicion and slander arise, making it impossible to clear their names.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, even if the auction is based on the regulations of the supervisory committee, a close examination of the regulations reveals that the items that can be disposed of must be either of a non-cultural nature or specifically listed. The listing of "furs, medicinal materials, food, silk, and other items" does not mention goldware. Yet, this time, a category of goldware was suddenly added to the auction. The authorities initially denied this, but when it could no longer be concealed, they added the words "unrelated to culture" before "goldware." This only aroused more suspicion. The responsibility of a custodian, as the name suggests, is solely to preserve, with absolutely no exceptions allowed. Once there is an exception, loopholes will be exploited and suspicion will arise. Unscrupulous individuals will use this exception as a pretext to carry out their theft and pilfering. At first, they will only act on small and insignificant items, but then they will become brazen and openly act on large and significant items. A slight initial carelessness will lead to endless problems. By then, even if those responsible have a hundred mouths, they will have no way to defend themselves.</p>
<p>The current rumors of auctions and relocations are still about small and insignificant items. In the future, it is difficult to guarantee that someone will not advance and covet the large and significant items. If we truly want to plan for permanent preservation today, so that these ancient cultural relics that have been passed down for thousands of years will not be lost again, then all relevant sectors should first jointly inspect and verify them with those responsible. This is to dispel the public's doubts and to express the sincerity of those responsible. Then, we can further discuss more stringent management methods. All sectors should also bear the joint responsibility of supervision, thoroughly rectify the situation, and transform secret storage into public display. Only then can we have some hope for the future of preservation.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a September 18th Memorial Meeting at the Auditorium at 10 am this morning. Those in attendance included Ju Zheng, Zhu Jiahua, Zhu Peide, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Hong Ludong, Zhang Daofan, Duan Xipeng, Zheng Zhannan, and approximately 700 staff members and guests. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting, leading the attendees in performing rituals. Ye Chucang then stood up to give a report, stating briefly that the Central Government’s declaration to the nation said, "In today's matters, if reason can be discussed, then discuss reason; if reason cannot be discussed, then engage in united strength and long-term resistance." These words may seem ordinary on the surface and lack new meaning. However, the Central Government believes that it is not trying to say surprising things to persuade people, but only wishes to achieve this ordinary step by step in order to recover the lost territory. Among the Kuomintang members, there are statistically 1.2 million people. It is important that they act with one heart and one mind, practically guiding the people, standing on the front lines, and achieving these four sentences to fight together. Farmers, industry, commerce, and students must also work together to complete the task of fighting. It should not be lip service, nor should it be outwardly compliant but inwardly estranged. Everyone must also bring out 100% conscience and 100% strength. In today's world of human warfare, survival cannot be achieved by hoping for reliance; there must be real strength to determine the victory or defeat in the final few minutes. It is hoped that comrades of this party will not have a dependency mentality or a wishful thinking mentality, and will avoid such thinking, etc. Ju Zheng then gave a speech, briefly stating that today is the anniversary of September 18th. In this past year, have all our party members and comrades working in the organization held in their minds and spirits the desire for revenge? Now, we must not forget the deep hatred at all times in order to recover the lost territory in the Northeast, etc. Ju finished his speech at 11 a.m. The first bell rang, and everyone observed five minutes of silence to express grief for the soldiers who died in the war of resistance against Japan and for the affected civilians. The second bell rang, the silence ended, and the meeting adjourned. Work resumed as usual, and there was a sense of urgency. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>September 18th Memorial Day</p>
<p>Large-Scale General Offensive by the Jilin Border Defense Army</p>
<p>丨Feng Zhanhai Telegraph Expresses Determination丨</p>
<p>"The Japanese Are Outwardly Strong but Inwardly Weak, and Their Combat Capabilities Are Not to Be Feared</p>
<p>As Long as Ammunition Is Sufficient, Recovering the Lost Territory Is Not Difficult"</p>
<p>(Beijing) Feng Zhanhai, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Border Defense Army, issued a notice to his subordinates, deciding to launch a large-scale general offensive on the September 18th Memorial Day to recover the lost territory, and telegraphed all parties to express his determination. The original text is as follows: All institutions, groups, and fathers, elders, brothers and sisters of the country are requested to note: Since September 18th of last year, the Japanese warlords have indulged their ambitions and disregarded international conventions, forcibly occupying our three northeastern provinces. The tragedy of wanton slaughter and killing is rare in the world. Our 30 million compatriots are groaning under the iron hooves of the Japanese bandits every day. Zhanhai himself led 130,000 troops, vowing to fight the Japanese bandits to the end. As long as there is one breath left, this ambition will not change. After years of fighting, he has recaptured famous cities, and the entire Manchurian Railway has been sabotaged from time to time. The enemy suffered heavy losses, so they dare not pass through it at night. They dare not lightly cross the railway line beyond fifty miles. The outward strength and inward weakness can be seen at a glance. Zhanhai himself has experienced battles and knows deeply that the combat capabilities of the Japanese bandits are not to be feared. As long as our army has sufficient preparations for ammunition and winter clothing, it is not difficult to recover the lost territory. This should be deeply noted by our fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters across the country. I think that the years are like flowing water, and the rivers and mountains have not been restored. The anniversary of September 18th is here again. People are dying and fleeing, and comrades are bleeding on the ground. The eyes are full of sores. The heart is painful and the hair is standing on end. I am ashamed to be a survivor and am determined to launch a large-scale general offensive on this day to swear to recover the lost territory and wash away the humiliation. In addition to reporting the battle situation at any time, I also hope that the elders of the country and overseas Chinese will give guidance and assistance from time to time. I am extremely hopeful. In addition, this telegram was sent by someone to various places in Guan Nei for sending and including: Feng Zhanhai, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Border Defense Army, led Gong Changhai, General Commander of the First Route, Yao Bingqian, General Commander of the Second Route, Wang Xisan, General Commander of the Third Route, Liu Wanhui, General Commander of the Fourth Route, and Zhao Weibin, General Commander of the Fifth Route, to respectfully request.</p>

<p>Telegram Urges Central Government to Suppress Rebels</p>

The authorities' non-resistance led to the current situation. There is no regret to be pursued. For the current plan, the only thing is to solemnly declare that this false treaty is not recognized on the one hand, and to quickly gather a large army to suppress the rebels and restore the lost territory on the other hand.

Therefore, citing this article implies a request to convene a conference. Currently, the attitudes of various countries are that Britain remains silent, France is very clear, and the United States, although unwilling to express itself alone, is willing to consult with various countries and express itself jointly after consultation. Shi Zhaoji's visit to the United States this time was under orders to have informal contacts with the U.S. authorities. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>A Regiment of Liu Zhennian's Troops Mutinies</p>
<p>Korean Army Occupies Shahe, Yexian County</p>
<p>Han Cables Chiang, Recounting the Shandong Incident</p>
<p>He Yingqin Inquires About the Truth of the Conflict</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The armies of Han and Liu are deadlocked. On the 17th night, a regiment of soldiers from Liu's first line of defense mutinied, and Shahe Town in Yexian County was completely looted. The Korean army occupied Shahe, Yexian County. On the 18th, Han issued a proclamation in Weifang, stating that Liu had long been harboring bandits and harming the people, and that there had been reports of riots since September 1st. Therefore, he dispatched a large army of 50,000 to encircle and suppress them. At present, the two armies are still in a stalemate. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuju cabled Chiang on the 18th, reporting the Shandong incident. The text was over 800 words long, briefly stating that Liu Zhennian had been levying exorbitant taxes. In Huangxian County alone, he had extorted 1.5 million, and other amounts of 800,000 and 200,000 were common. The regular and miscellaneous taxes had already exceeded 1 million this year. It was rumored that there was a September 1st uprising. In April, the Shandong Fellow Association in Beiping sent an urgent telegram appealing to the provincial government, reporting Liu's tyrannical behavior and submitting a record to the National Government. The telegram partly stated, "Failing to suppress bandits is already an unforgivable crime; preventing the suppression of bandits is akin to being beyond the pale of civilization. The people of various counties who have been harmed are kneeling and weeping, their complaints incessant. Fuju, by virtue of his responsibilities, cannot shirk his duty. How dare he abandon his duty and bring about his own downfall? Driven by conscience, to protect the country and the people, and to relieve the suffering of the people, he vows to drive out this villain to save the lives of the people. All his unavoidable grievances are presented for your consideration." (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian's representative in Nanjing, Yang Lichuan, had just arrived in Nanjing from Yantai.

It was widely rumored that a large number of troops were concentrated in the Weixian area, causing many rumors in Yantai. He telegraphed him to inquire about the truth, but he firmly believed that since his army had been stationed in Shandong for several years, the local area had been peaceful and had a good relationship with Chairman Han. At a time when national disaster was imminent, all soldiers should unite to avoid being laughed at by foreigners for their lack of organization. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

In order to maintain the administrative system, the provincial government requested him to remit the funds to the provincial government, which would then allocate them for basic expenses. Liu demanded 200,000 per month, but even after allocating 200,000, Liu still intercepted local tax revenues. On the 14th, Liu suddenly moved troops towards Weixian County, passing through Shahe to attack Weixian County via Changyi and Pingdu, plotting to occupy Qingdao. Han rushed to Weixian County yesterday and mobilized troops to prevent it. If Liu does not come to his senses, a fierce battle may be unavoidable. It is said that 50,000 Korean troops are concentrated in Jiaodong. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>Japan Confirms Its Policy Towards the League of Nations</p>
<p>No Intervention Allowed in the Recognition of Puppet Organizations</p>
<p>Intentionally Releasing League Exit Air to Intimidate the League of Nations</p>
<p>Den-tsu 18th, Tokyo: Although European and American countries are currently silent on Japan's recognition of Manchuria, they are focusing all their efforts on the League of Nations General Assembly. The Japanese government, from Prime Minister Saitō to Foreign Minister Uchida, Army Minister Araki, Ambassador Debuchi, Participant Yoshida, and other officials, is collecting information from all sides and discussing countermeasures. Its fundamental policy has reportedly been determined as follows: (1) The independence of "Manchukuo" and the recognition of "Manchukuo" do not violate international treaties and are faits accomplis. They cannot be canceled or changed by a resolution of fifty-three to one. Furthermore, if the League of Nations attempts to cancel Japan's recognition, it would be suppressing Japan's sovereignty, which will be absolutely opposed. (2) Japan will absolutely oppose the application of Article 15 of the League Covenant to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Although Japan expresses overall opposition to the convening of a special general assembly, considering past relations, it will send Japanese representatives to attend as explainers to ensure that the worst possible outcome does not occur with the League of Nations. (3) If the League of Nations disregards Japan's claims, denies the independence of Manchukuo, and uses a 52-to-1 resolution to suppress Japan's legitimate claims, Japan will not only withdraw its delegation from the League of Nations but will also withdraw from the League of Nations altogether, and the responsibility for this will lie entirely with the League of Nations' obstinacy.</p>
<p>Reuters 18th, Tokyo: Foreign Ministry officials are currently considering what attitude Japan should take towards the Sino-Japanese dispute being discussed at next month's League of Nations General Assembly. It is now hoped that the League of Nations will understand Japan's position and prevent the situation from becoming more serious. Influential newspapers such as the Kokumin Shimbun have stated that if the League of Nations forces Japan to withdraw its recognition of "Manchukuo" or denies the independence of "Manchukuo," the result will be Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations. No matter what the League of Nations decides, Japan will never withdraw this recognition, because Japan's recognition and the independence of "Manchukuo" do not violate any treaties.</p>
<p>The League of Nations Worries About the Far East Situation</p>
<p>Our Protest to Japan Delivered to Geneva</p>
<p>The United States Accepts Our Note but Remains Silent for the Time Being</p>
<p>Reuters 18th, London: The League of Nations' concerns about the Far East situation and Germany's refusal to continue participating in the disarmament conference are the two major events noted by today's Sunday newspapers. An editorial in The Observer states that if the situation in Western Europe is causing anxiety to the League of Nations, this anxiety will be further exacerbated by the situation in the Far East. Today's question is whether the League of Nations can persuade Japan to remain a member. If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, the damage will be borne by Geneva, not Tokyo. It also states that the League of Nations will no longer be concerned about the Far East issue because Soviet Russia and the United States are not members of the League of Nations, and China is a difficult country to grasp. The Sunday Times strongly advocates that Great Britain should take a more proactive policy, stating that Japan's actions are a major hazard for both economic and military reasons. If we do not dare to act effectively to deal with it now, the opportunity for disarmament will be greatly weakened. In addition, the United States is currently looking forward to Britain taking a proactive policy. If Britain remains silent, the war debt agreement, which has already been jeopardized by the failure of disarmament, will be greatly reduced in its chances of success due to misunderstandings between the two countries.</p>
<p>Kokuminsha 17th, Geneva: China's telegram protesting Japan's recognition of the puppet organization in the Northeast and the Japanese government's telegram notifying the League of Nations of the contents of the agreements signed between Japan and the puppet organization arrived in Geneva today at the same time. The Chinese government's telegram was addressed to the President of the League of Nations General Assembly and will be distributed to the member states before being released. The Japanese telegram was merely a notification and did not request registration with the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Kokuminsha 17th, Washington: Today, the Chinese legation published a document from the Chinese government to the United States denouncing Japan's violation of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, according to a certain gentleman within the US government, the United States is still waiting and does not intend to take immediate action.</p>
<p>Japan Tries Hard to Entice Soviet Russia</p>
<p>To Recognize the Puppet Organization</p>
<p>Far East News Agency 18th, Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the attitude of Soviet Russia towards Manchuria is very important, so it has tried hard to entice it to recognize the puppet state of Manchukuo, seeking friendship between Japan and Russia and jointly building East Asia. However, Soviet Russia believes that the Japanese government's move is merely to realize its ambitions to invade Manchuria and is not sincere. Therefore, it also proposed that a non-aggression treaty between Japan and Russia must first be signed before it can agree. The Japanese side believes that such conditions are difficult to achieve, so there has been no result.</p>

<p>Den-tsu 18th, Tokyo: Regarding the flood situation in Hokkaido, according to the investigation by the Ministry of Home Affairs' Social Affairs Bureau, there has been continuous heavy rain since the 4th and 5th, and the damage has affected the entire island except for Nemuro, Kushiro, and Tokachi. Agricultural products are almost completely destroyed, with at most 20% remaining. The damage is estimated at approximately 14.44 million yen. As of today, there have been 13 deaths and 12 injuries. In addition, as a result of the lack of drinking water, infectious diseases are rampant in the affected areas, and the situation is extremely tragic.</p>
<p>Former Japanese Railway Minister Eki Passes Away</p>
<p>Den-tsu 18th, Tokyo: Former Railway Minister Eki Tsubasa passed away today. He had been suffering from pyloric stenosis and underwent surgery, but it did not improve. He had been recuperating at his private residence in Akasaka Omote-cho. His condition became critical this morning, and he passed away at 1:30 PM today at the age of 60. He was from Yamaguchi Prefecture. In the 30th year of Meiji, he graduated from the English and French Law Department of the Law School of Tokyo Imperial University. He supplemented the Ministry of Home Affairs and served as a councillor of the Kanagawa Prefecture, a councillor of the Bureau of Legislation, and concurrently as a secretary of the Cabinet. He later served as Chief Secretary of the Cabinet three times, and was also appointed as a member of the House of Peers. He earned a doctorate in law during this time. In August of the 14th year of Taisho, when the Katō Cabinet was formed, he was appointed as Minister of Justice. In July of the 4th year of Showa, when the Hamaguchi Cabinet was formed, he was appointed as Minister of Railways until the Wakatsuki Cabinet era. Later, the Wakatsuki Cabinet resigned and he went into opposition.</p>
<p>Den-tsu 18th, Tokyo: Eki Tsubasa, the civil administration advisor who passed away today, served as Minister of Railways in the Hamaguchi Cabinet. He and Interior Minister Adachi were considered the twin pillars of the cabinet. During the London Naval Treaty issue, he clashed with the then-Chief of Naval General Staff Kato Kanji, causing a dispute within the Privy Council. After Prime Minister Hamaguchi was assassinated at Tokyo Station, the cabinet collapsed. Hamaguchi resigned as president of the Seiyukai, and Eki introduced Wakatsuki as the party leader. He and Adachi were both considered future presidents.</p>
<p>Japan Sends Student Envoys to Manchukuo</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun says that Japanese student envoys have been selected by the National Elementary School Teachers Association, local education associations, and school principals through consultation, selecting healthy children with excellent academic performance and intelligence. Following a lottery method, fifteen student envoys, including Yamaguchi and Takano, were selected, led by principals and teachers such as Watanabe, Ueji, Yokokawa, Tamura, and Nishimura. They are scheduled to hold a group formation ceremony on the 18th and depart from Tokyo on the 19th. They will bring gifts to the Puyi couple, Zheng Xiaoxu, Mutō, and carry missions from Minister of Education Hatoyama, Minister of Colonial Affairs Nagai, and President Motoyama of the Nichinichi Shimbun.</p>
<p>Germany Rebuilds Its Military</p>
<p>A Major Threat to France</p>
<p>Chairman of the Disarmament Conference Goes to Geneva</p>
<p>Still Optimistic About the Future of the Conference</p>
<p>Havas 17th, Paris: In recent days, the members of the Chamber of Deputies have paid close attention to the threat of Germany's rebuilding of its military. In the afternoon, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Herriot made a statement on this matter to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies. Mr. Soulières, a member of the right-wing Paris City Council, will ask Herriot whether he intends to submit the file on Germany's rebuilding of its military to the negotiating parties when conducting international negotiations.</p>
<p>Havas 17th, Paris: Yesterday, the German Foreign Minister sent a letter to Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, stating that Germany had decided not to participate in the presidium of the Disarmament Conference in Geneva. Today, the Times in this area criticized this letter with the title "Germany and Disarmament," which reads in part, "Today's serious problem is not Germany's demand for equality in armaments, but Germany's determination to rebuild its military. Germany's determination can be seen in the recent declaration of its Minister of Defense and the memorandum that Germany sent to the French government about two weeks ago. Recently, the German government created a national youth sports organization and managed it with special mechanisms. Its purpose is to model itself directly on the Italian Fascist Youth and the Soviet Communist Youth, and to have German youth receive military training as well. This is known to everyone. From this alone, the German people's determination to rebuild their military is even more obvious."</p>
<p>Havas 17th, London: At 2:00 PM, Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, set off for Geneva to chair the meeting of the conference presidium on the 21st. Lord Cecil, the British representative to the League of Nations, traveled in the same car as Henderson. Before the car set off, someone asked Henderson about Germany's demand for equal rights in armaments. Henderson replied, "The presidium will immediately pay attention to Germany's notice of not participating in the disarmament work. However, I am not worried because Germany did not say in the notice that it will still pay close attention to the disarmament work, and its future attitude will change depending on the progress of the meeting. Therefore, the road to progress is not yet cut off. The responsibilities that the disarmament conference should complete are certainly not small, but if we can find a practical way to achieve universal disarmament besides the arbitration system, universal security will be achieved. I believe that mankind has now come to a fork in the road, one side being disarmament and security, and the other being competitive armament and insecurity, and the danger of war. We should decide between these two. The disarmament conference should not forget the above-mentioned reality, and when it encounters a suitable opportunity, it will lead the world into a smooth path. It is not my belief that the disarmament conference will lose its opportunity and fail."</p>
<p>Disarmament Proposals Cannot be Implemented</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Threatens to Withdraw from the League of Nations</p>
<p>Kokuminsha 17th, Rome: Italy has threatened to withdraw from the League of Nations if its proposals are not submitted for discussion at this session. According to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, what he says, he does. It is also heard that he had consulted with the former Foreign Minister and Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Grandi, and gave him strict instructions, instructing him to try to force the British government to force France to take a more tolerant attitude towards Germany's demand for equality in armaments. Therefore, political circles here have been discussing this matter in recent days. However, it is still difficult to say at this time whether Mussolini will personally go to Geneva.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency 18th, Rome: It has been rumored in Germany that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will personally participate in the work of the Disarmament Conference. This news has recently been officially denied.</p>
<p>Britain Intends to Determine Reconciliation Methods</p>
<p>Kokuminsha 17th, London: According to reliable sources, a formula has been drafted within Downing Street in the Prime Minister's residence, whereby the major powers will independently guarantee a large reduction in armaments in the hope of bridging the gap between Germany and the former Allied Powers. It is also heard that Britain has agreed to include Germany's demands in the disarmament convention, hoping that this solution will be accepted by all the powers and Germany. According to reports in this morning's newspapers, the British government has changed its original intention and intends to try to mediate the German-French matter without waiting for the League of Nations Council to do so at the end of this week, hoping that Germany can return to the Disarmament Conference. The aforementioned news further confirms this statement.</p>

<p>Ma Zhanshan's Earnest Appeal to the Nation (Continued)</p>
<p>Ever since the violent invasion and occupation of Liaoning and Jilin by the brutal Japanese, although their representative Yoshizawa repeatedly declared to the international community that they would never undermine the territorial integrity of China, their determination to actively advance their troops and annex Jiang Province grew more urgent day by day. Initially, they used Zhang Haipeng's troops to attack, and then openly, under the pretext of protecting the repair of the Jiangqiao Bridge, they mobilized a large force of Japanese troops to approach the provincial capital. We, respecting the resolutions of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, made every effort to avoid conflict, hoping to maintain world peace and prevent devastation in the region. We also repeatedly telegraphed our representative Shi to the League of Nations, urging them to reflect. However, like a ravenous boar or a long serpent, they advanced inch by inch. With the greedy ambition of wolves, they remained insatiable. Zhanshan, responsible for defending the territory, had no choice but to implement our national self-defense policy and meet them with arms. At that time, our army was filled with righteous indignation, and everyone was determined to die. They fought day and night, their spirit soaring to the clouds. However, they were ultimately defeated due to inferior weaponry, coupled with enemy planes dropping bombs on residents inside and outside the provincial city. Zhanshan, due to the appeal of the people and respecting the resolution of the League of Nations, began to withdraw his troops to the Hailun area. These are the facts of the past war with the enemy, which have been repeatedly telegraphed and announced, and I hope they will be universally acknowledged.</p>
<p>After withdrawing to Hailun, while actively replenishing military supplies to make a final stand, the war in Harbin broke out. Consequently, he dispatched troops to block the Japanese army stationed in Jiang from attacking Harbin, while also using the main force to assist Ding and Li, planning to connect these two armies, providing mutual support from east and west, hoping to prevent the brutal enemy's military strength from succeeding. Unexpectedly, just as our army arrived at Majiachuan Kou on the north bank of the Songhua River, Ding and Li's troops were already unable to withstand and retreated. The Japanese, detecting our army's move to aid Harbin, decided to launch a pincer attack from Qiqihar and Hailar with heavy troops, aiming to eliminate our military strength. At that time, there was a strong enemy attacking from the front, no important pass to defend in the rear, inferior weapons and ammunition internally, and isolated and cut off from aid externally. Survival was hanging by a thread. Zhanshan had been a soldier since childhood, experienced in battles, and had long put life and death aside. Considering that death can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather, if I were to drive my loyal and righteous army to fight against the strong enemy's sharp and substantial artillery fire, the result would only be a temporary sacrifice, pleasing the enemy and further diminishing the chances of recovery. After repeated deliberation, to solve the immediate crisis, the only way was to deal with the situation as circumstances dictated, slowing down the enemy's advance, so that we could preserve our army's existing strength and wait for an opportunity to counterattack. We could also take the opportunity to investigate the Japanese's true plan to invade our territory. Therefore, I did not hesitate to risk going to Harbin to meet with the Japanese Lieutenant General Domon, using the principle of prevarication to stall them. Thus, a lifeline for the Northeast could be preserved. This is the tortuous and painful story of how Zhanshan dealt with the Japanese.</p>
<p>The most important thing in the international community is trust and morality. No one can rely solely on violence and fraud to gain the sympathy of civilized countries around the world. However, Japan disregards everything, risking infamy. The poison of its plans is unexpected at every turn. Now that the international investigation team is coming east soon, if I do not expose and declare to the world the various conspiracies of the Japanese that Zhanshan has personally seen and heard for more than forty days, who will know the deceitful tricks of the Japanese, and who will know that the 30 million people of our three northeastern provinces are in a hell from which there is no return? On the second</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>day of February, Zhanshan, in order to understand the truth about the Japanese creating a puppet government in Manchuria, and also because of the Japanese invitation, risked going to the Liaoning Conference again. The next day, he met with the Japanese Kanto Commander Honjo, who said that most of the three northeastern provinces had been occupied by the Japanese army, and only a small part of Jilin and Heilongjiang would be difficult to resist. He hoped to cooperate with the Japanese side. That evening, he was forced to attend a meeting at Zhao Xinbo's house. All the proposals made by Zhanshan to abolish the puppet state's production were rejected by the Japanese side. On the 18th, he feigned illness and returned to Hailun. Soon after, according to Zhao Zhongren's report, on the 19th, the Japanese military headquarters forced Zhang Jinghui to establish a preparatory committee for the puppet state and ordered Zhang Jinghui and Zhao Zhongren to lead twelve puppet representatives from the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, who had been bought by the Japanese side, to Lushun to urge Puyi to be the head of the puppet state. The Japanese side instructed Puyi to decline three times, and the representatives urged him three times before completing their mission.</p>
<p>On March 9th, the day the puppet government was established, Zhanshan originally intended to find an excuse not to go, but in order to avoid Japanese suspicion, he had to go to Changchun. On the 10th, Komai, who is now the Director-General of the General Affairs Office of the puppet State Council, and Itagaki, the puppet high advisor, announced at the State Council meeting, by order of the Japanese military headquarters, that the puppet government would set up a General Affairs Office to manage all real political affairs of the various departments. Any political decree could not be implemented without the signature and seal of the office. On the 11th, Itagaki and Komai also announced at the State Council meeting that the Japanese military headquarters planned to have Japanese officials occupy half of the official positions in the puppet government and four-tenths of the official positions in various puppet provincial and prefectural governments in the future. For the time being, the number had been reduced, and only a hundred or so people were newly assigned to the government. Subsequently, the issue of Japanese naturalization was discussed. Xi Qia made a cautious proposal, which was severely reprimanded by Komai and Itagaki, who said that all Japanese residing in the Eastern Provinces had been exchanged for with iron and blood and should naturally be affiliated with the new country's nationality, without the need for caution. As for whether to renounce Japanese nationality, the Japanese themselves had the right to weigh it, and others were not allowed to advise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it was announced that each of the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang would establish a General Affairs Office and a Police Affairs Office, all of which would be staffed by Japanese, who would control all the powers of each province. However, the General Affairs and Police Affairs offices in Jiang Province were temporarily allowed to be delayed due to Zhanshan's strong opposition, and the Japanese would take over in three months. By the 16th, Honjo came to Jiang to inspect the Dasingzhen position and said that Japan was determined, no matter what the sacrifice, never to give up the three northeastern provinces. If anyone opposed the new country, the Japanese army would be fully responsible for eliminating them. Even if a third country came out to intervene, they would declare war on them. As for political decrees, they could proceed step by step, but they had to be approved by the Japanese military headquarters stationed there. Moreover, Doihara, the head of the special service agency stationed in Harbin, and Suzuki, the brigade commander stationed in Jiang, claimed that after Japan obtained the three northeastern provinces, it had sufficient materials to make various progresses, and it would build the foundation for invading the Soviet Union to the north and resisting the United States to the east. Furthermore, it carried out an active invasion of land, transportation, finance, and education. The puppet State Council resolved: (1) All northeastern land that had already been leased out would be confiscated in full if the landowners were officials or former warlords. If the number of acres owned by ordinary people was large, half of them would be purchased at official prices. All land that had not been leased out would be confiscated by the puppet state for the Japanese government to implement immigration. (2) The Huhu-Hailun railway was the key to grain transportation in our Jiang Province. The Japanese made an agreement with Zhang Jinghui, forcing him to mortgage it for three million yuan at a price of one percent. Although the term was set for 50 years, it was tantamount to permanent occupation. They also feared that Zhanshan would not be able to accept the supplementary signature, which was sternly rejected. Recently, they have been approaching the puppet Ministry of Communications. (3) They were planning to establish a puppet Manchurian state bank, imitating the Korean bank's method, in order to manipulate finance and absorb our fat. (4) They were destroying our schools and invading our culture. All schools, in addition to stationing troops, would have all the original nationally designated textbooks at all levels that inspired patriotism deleted and revised, incorporating pro-Japanese ideas, to eliminate our national character. They were also extremely destructive of freedom of speech, even fabricating public opinion to confuse people's vision and hearing. Moreover, they were brutally murdering our intellectuals. Anyone who had been educated and had a patriotic heart was assassinated and buried alive. Former Finance Director Yan Rui, Taosuo Railway Director Zhang Kui'en, and others all suffered tragic deaths.</p>
<p>In summary, the Japanese ambition to annex the three northeastern provinces and destroy the world peace treaty has been openly manifested. However, they are still falsely claiming to the international community that the establishment of the new state of Manchuria is an act of self-determination by the people of the Northeast, while in reality, they are using all means of coercion and threats. The so-called public opinion is purely fabricated by the Japanese themselves. As the saying goes, "One hand cannot cover the eyes and ears of all the people in the world." This is what it means.</p>
<p>Zhanshan is just a warrior, lacking in knowledge, but bearing the heavy responsibility entrusted by the state and the deep trust placed in him by the people. Therefore, in recent months, he has not hesitated to risk his life alone, enduring humiliation and slander, and dealing with the national enemy with whom the Han cannot coexist, all in order to wait for the farmers to start plowing in the spring, to allow his troops to rest and recuperate a little, and then make a major move to achieve complete success. Now that the truth about the puppet state fabricated by the Japanese is clear, and the investigation team is coming east soon, it is time to seize the opportunity to instigate action. Therefore, he secretly distributed his troops in key locations and urgently came to Heihe on April 7. All important personnel from the Heilongjiang military and political offices had secretly taken the Guanfang seal to Heihe in advance and immediately resumed work as usual to plan for recovery. Although he knew that he was weak and unable to support the overall situation, his eagerness to save the country left him with no choice but to go back. He had already resolved to burn the boats after crossing the river. If he succeeded, he would be like Shao Kang with one brigade; if he failed, he would emulate Tian Heng's five hundred. As long as there was a breath left, he vowed to fight the Japanese to the end, regardless of success or failure. Alas, the country is unfortunate, and disaster arises from strong neighbors. The Baishan Mountains and Shanghai have suffered the same catastrophe. From now on, he will not return alive until he has beheaded Loulan. However, he fears that the pain of seeking compromises will not be understood by the people of the country. Therefore, he telegraphed the detailed circumstances of the intervening period to you. In the past, Zhuang Miao returned to Cao, his heart set on the Han Dynasty. Zifang assisted Liu, eager to preserve Han. Zhanshan is mediocre and foolish, and secretly admires them. Whether you know me or blame me, only the gentlemen of the country can tell. Upon reading the telegram, I am grieved and indignant, and I do not know what to say. Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, bows and stamps.</p>

<p>Fellow Townsmen in Beiping Petition for the Suppression of Liu Zhennian</p>
<p>Han Personally Leads a Large Army to Weixian for Deployment</p>
<p>Weixian Correspondence, Since the reorganization of Liu Zhennian's 21st Division in the seventeenth year of the Republic, it has been stationed in more than ten counties in eastern Shandong. Within its defense area, it has appointed and dismissed officials and collected taxes, and the provincial government has been unable to interfere. Recently, there have been rumors in the province that Liu intends to seize Weixian on a specific date. Therefore, Han Fuju, Chairman of the Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route Army, personally led a large army to Weixian for deployment, and Shen Honglie's navy was guarding the coastal area of Yantai. Now, a large army has gathered in eastern Shandong, and a conflict seems imminent. The details of the events and Han's remarks are described below:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident: Liu Zhennian's various actions in more than ten counties in eastern Shandong have caused considerable dissatisfaction among the local people. Recently, it was reported that the Shandong Fellow Townsmen Association in Beiping had submitted a most vehement petition to Han, enumerating Liu's crimes and requesting his suppression. At the same time, Han received a report that Liu was preparing to seize Weixian. He reported all the circumstances to the central government and requested instructions. He heard that the central government had replied by telegram, authorizing him to take action as circumstances dictated. Thereupon, he mobilized troops and began to deploy defenses. As for Liu Zhennian's office in Jinan (located at Weier Road on Jingsi Road), the director, Fu Yingxian, had already left Jinan several days ago. Yesterday (the 16th) morning, the authorities ordered it to be closed down, and only a few servants were dismissed.</p>
<p>Large Army Gathering: The mobilization of troops began a week</p>
<p>ago. It is estimated that the 22nd Division of Gu Liangmin, the 29th Division of Cao Fulin, the 81st Division of Zhan Shutang, as well as a part of the 74th Division of Qiao Lizhi, a part of the 20th Division of Sun Tongxuan, the cavalry brigade of Li Xuande, the pistol brigade of Lei Taiping, and the local militia of various counties in eastern Shandong participated, totaling approximately more than 100,000 people. Shen Honglie's navy also sailed from Qingdao to Yantai and patrolled the coast.</p>
<p>Han's Remarks: In recent days, a large army has gathered in eastern Shandong, with Weixian as the center. Important generals also arrived early. Commander-in-Chief Han Fuju and Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang arrived in Weixian at 3:00 p.m. yesterday and stayed at the Weixian Chamber of Commerce. It is rumored that the vanguard has already made contact, but the authorities are still denying it. I visited Han this morning to inquire about everything. According to his remarks, Liu Zhennian has been tyrannical in eastern Shandong for more than a year. The people in eastern Shandong have long known about it. He not only controls administrative taxation, destroying Shandong's administrative system, but also plotting a rebellion. The bandits recently captured have mostly received Liu's appointment and are preparing to seize Weixian around October 10th. He is responsible for this and cannot sit idly by. Therefore, he brought people here to intercept. If they do not come to invade, he will never oppress them. If they come to invade, he will immediately defend and intercept them, and announce their crimes. Liu's troops are stationed in the areas of Dengzhou, Yexian, and Zhaoyuan. They are now 25 miles away from Changyi. My army's two brigades of Ma Guan-yi and Chen Dexin are in Changyi. There has been no contact yet. We will see if Liu has any regrets, (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Details of the Case of the Yongnian Steamer's Smuggling of Opium <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Nine Hundred and Sixty-Seven Jin of Opium</p>
<p>Five Hundred and Seventy-Eight Jin of Morphine</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence, The Yongnian Steamer, sailing from Sichuan to Hankou, was intercepted on the 11th, when a large shipment of opium and morphine was discovered by the Customs Section of the Special Tax Office. This case, like the YuChuan Steamer smuggling case previously uncovered by the Garrison Department, is one after the other. Wang Boqun and the wife of Wang's secretary-general, Zhang Shuangqing, came to Hankou on this steamer. After the ship arrived in Hankou, Wang and others disembarked. Personnel from the Customs Section of the Special Tax Office then boarded the ship to inspect it. Liu Xieheng came forward to obstruct them, saying that these boxes were the luggage of a certain party and could not be inspected. The personnel from the Special Tax Office told them that they were ordered to search for opium. Could you prove that there was no opium in the luggage? Liu was speechless. The personnel from the Special Tax Office immediately arrested him and opened the boxes for inspection. They found drugs worth more than 100,000 yuan. At the same time, Zhang Shuangqing admitted that several pieces of jewelry in the opium box belonged to her personally. Because she was a major suspect, the Garrison Department arrested her as well. After this incident occurred, society paid great attention. General speculations were that it could not be done by ordinary opium traffickers. It is said that the scale of this opium transport was very large. The Yongnian Steamer was the first batch, and the rest all returned to Sichuan upon hearing the news. Now, the original text of the Special Tax Office's report to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the list of poisons are obtained and disclosed as follows:</p>
<p>"According to a report from Fang Shaowei, the head of the Customs Section of my office, the Yongnian Steamer, which sailed from Chongqing to Shanghai, arrived in Hankou on the eleventh of this month. I immediately ordered the search team to board the ship for inspection. Subsequently, opium and morphine were discovered in the ship's cabins and stern, totaling twenty-five boxes of various sizes. Liu Xieheng, the person who obstructed the inspection at the time, was also captured and reported to your office. Deputy Section Chief Chen arrived on the scene to supervise the transfer to your office for verification and collection. At the same time, the Second, Third, and Fourth Sections and the Supervision Office were requested to send personnel to jointly inspect the goods. The morphine, opium, clothing, and jewelry in the boxes were mixed and packed. After inspection, they were sorted, packed, and consolidated. After all the results were consolidated, there were eight boxes of morphine, fourteen boxes of opium, and two boxes of clothing and jewelry. In addition, one empty box was emptied. Seal labels were affixed and handed over to the Supervision Office for safekeeping. Liu Xieheng was sent to the Enforcement Room for detention. The matter has been reported for verification. According to this, while the verification was in progress, at 10:00 a.m. today, Deputy Officer Chen Xizeng, dispatched by your department, and Commander Ye Peng, came to the office to inspect the goods. It was found that there were a total of 360 packages in eight boxes of morphine of various sizes, 594 pieces in fourteen boxes of opium of various sizes, and 24 boxes in total with the addition of two boxes containing gold and silver jewelry. There was also one empty box. The morphine and opium were weighed together with the boxes, and the gross weight was counted. The two boxes of clothing were weighed at 91 jin together with the boxes, and the details were not counted. Subsequently, Deputy Officer Chen and Commander Ye witnessed and verified the goods, affixed seal labels, and signed their names together on the seal labels as evidence. They also opened a list of the gross weight details that they had witnessed and carried it back to submit for review. At 2:00 p.m. today, Director Zhang Nanxian of the Supervisory Office of the Party and Government Committee of your department came to the office to investigate the goods, also signed and sealed the goods, and handed them over to the Supervisory Office of my office for safekeeping. In addition to Liu Xieheng, who obstructed the inspection, being interrogated separately by my office, I respectfully submit the morphine and opium by box, with their gross weight and number, and a list of the clothes and jewelry. The details are as follows: 1. 63 packages of morphine, gross weight with box 122 jin; 2. 100 pieces of opium, 102 jin; 3. 60 pieces of opium, 66 jin; 4. 30 pieces of opium, 53 jin; 5. 69 packages of morphine, 105 jin; 6. 36 packages of morphine, 72 jin; 7. 60 packages of morphine, 94 jin; 8. 55 pieces of opium, 93 jin; 9. 28 packages of morphine, 46 jin; 10. 15 pieces of opium, 47 jin; 11. 36 pieces of opium, 98 jin; 12. 41 pieces of opium, 104 jin; 13. 11 pieces of opium, 46 jin; 14. 46 packages of morphine, 39 jin; 15. 20 packages of morphine, 32 jin; 16. 55 pieces of opium, 85 jin; 17. 32 pieces of opium, 50 jin; 18. 32 pieces of opium, 56 jin; 19. 16 pieces of opium, 27 jin; 20. 38 packages of morphine, 68 jin; 21. 80 pieces of opium, 105 jin; 22. 29 pieces of opium, 35 jin; 23.

<p>Rice Mill Workers Strike: There are dozens of rice mills in this city, both inside and outside the city. Farmers and businesses in the surrounding villages use them to polish brown rice for sale in Shanghai. The mills are currently in operation as it is the market season. About 140 Jiangbei workers hired by eight mills, including Jufeng Rice Mill outside the West Gate, demanded an increase in wages, as their wages were meager, with three cents of silver per stone of rice milled and one silver dollar per stone loaded onto ships. Recently, with the soaring price of foreign goods and the high cost of living, they agreed to demand an increase in wages to five cents of silver per stone of rice milled and two copper coins per stone loaded onto ships in order to maintain their livelihood. They notified the mill owners before the Mid-Autumn Festival, stating that this proposal came entirely from the workers and had nothing to do with the foremen. After receiving the report, the employers inquired with the foremen, who all claimed ignorance. Since the workers did not send representatives or go to the mills for negotiations after issuing the notice, the employers did not respond. Unexpectedly, the workers, seeing no action from the employers, went on strike unanimously at 8:00 a.m. on the 17th. The mill owners have now convened a meeting to determine a solution, and it is not known whether work will resume soon.</p>
<p>Anniversary of the "September 18th" National Crisis: Today marks the anniversary of the day when Japanese imperialism plundered Shenyang last year. Gloomy clouds and tragic rain have passed in the blink of an eye. The county executive committee, upon receiving a provincial order, held a commemorative ceremony. Representatives from various organizations participated, and various agencies and businesses also flew flags at half-mast to show that they will not forget the recovery of lost territory and vow to avenge the national humiliation. Entertainment venues in the city, such as the People's Grand Theater, cinemas, various bookstores, and banquets, were all closed for one day.</p>

<p>The Accountant of Yuanpu Farm Sent to the County for Custody: Li Yaonan, the former farm manager of Yuanpu Farm in this county, accumulated arrears of field deeds and taxes amounting to more than 8,800 yuan during his three years in office. After the new manager, Pang Derong, took over, he discovered embezzlement. After gathering the relevant local agencies for a public investigation, it was confirmed to be true. He repeatedly notified and scheduled meetings, but the former manager shirked his responsibilities and has not settled the matter to this day. Now, in order to ensure the proper handling of public funds, Manager Pang has sent the former accountant, Wang Qizhang, to the county for custody today. At the same time, he has petitioned the Songjiang Salt Transport Deputy Envoy to set a deadline for the recovery of the funds in order to complete the procedures.</p>

<p>Skeletal Examination in the Suspected Death Case in Tianzhuang: In Tianzhuang Town, District 5 of this county, the wife of farmer Xu Guansheng, Xu Zhao, suddenly fell into the water and died last month. Without reporting the incident, the family immediately prepared for the funeral. Unexpectedly, rumors spread in the village that Zhao's death was strange, with some saying that she was beaten to death and thrown into the river, while others said that she fell into the river and died, claiming that her body was covered with bruises. As a result, villagers such as Yang Zhenmin and Yang Qiyu petitioned the county government to handle the matter impartially so that the truth could be revealed and grievances cleared. After two court hearings, both the plaintiff and the defendant held their own grounds and debated the results. Both parties requested an exhumation and examination. After approval by Examining Officer Huang, Bailiff Zhu Zhen was dispatched to the countryside to seal and cut the corners of the coffin and transport it to the city to await exhumation and examination. At the same time, the High Court was petitioned to send Examining Officer Xuanfang from the Wuxian District Court of Suzhou to Changshu. It was decided to exhume the coffin and examine it on the 17th of this month. At that time, Examining Officer Huang Jie led a full team of bailiffs to the claw climbing bay corpse field outside the North Gate, first interrogating the plaintiff and defendant one by one. After the plaintiff and defendant submitted a written guarantee, the coffin was exhumed and examined. Zhong Xuan and others examined the body for a long time, but there were still no results. The bones were then wrapped and steamed for examination on the morning of the 18th. More than a thousand people watched. The result was no injuries. The accusers, Yang Zhenmin and Yang Qiyu, were taken into custody.</p>

<p>Sir, I have just read the local news in your newspaper on September 15th, which published a report on the accusation against the head of the eighth district of Kunshan. Upon investigation, this matter is currently awaiting handling by the county government. When it is unavoidable, we may request a transfer of jurisdiction to the judicial system or file a complaint with the provincial government. It cannot be predetermined at this time. The report in your newspaper that a complaint has been filed with the Civil Affairs Department is slightly inconsistent with the facts. I am writing to request a correction to ensure accuracy. Wu Renjie.</p>

<h3 id="e14">French Ancient Four Knights and the Modern French Tennis Four Knights (From Right to Left) The Majesty of Cochet, Lacoste, Borotra, and Brugnon, (Borrowed Print by Sun Linfang), fierce attacks, but their defense was too weak to support the forwards. At this time, Soviet General Mike Glorie's performance was particularly amazing, accurately passing the ball countless times to support both wings, but all missed opportunities, which was a pity. Mike had a great shot that was saved by Schoth, and Irish center forward English also had a wonderful shot that missed. Continued to score two more goals. But Scotland never slacked off. McPhee received a pass from Crawford and broke through Ireland for the third time. In the end, Soviet center forward Mike Glorie went straight in and broke through several lines of defense, sending the ball into the net. As a result, Scotland won a big victory 4-0. Tennis Ramblings Introducing young tennis player Sun Linfang Further Discussion of German Tennis Cartoons Here, I want to introduce a new tennis player and enthusiastic tennis fan, a beautiful young man often seen on the Chinese tennis court. His name is Sun Linfang. He went to Germany to study in 1928 and was very enthusiastic about tennis. He joined the Berlin Riviera Tennis Club as a member and received expert guidance, so his hitting posture is purely German style. He returned to China in May of this year and continued to practice at the Chinese tennis court. Now he has reached the finals of the Shanghai Grass Tennis Club Open Group B Singles Championship. His opponent is the Portuguese Sinna. He will definitely be able to easily defeat his opponent and win the championship. Although his current technique is not very refined, he has a great foundation and his future is very promising. During his years in Germany, he specialized in collecting photos of world tennis stars, either clipping them from newspapers and magazines or purchasing them from photo studios. He meticulously traced and cut out photos of postures and artistically pasted them in photo albums. He now has five or six hundred photos, a rich collection of tennis players from various countries, both male and female, old and young. He also has a hundred or so volumes of various tennis magazines. He is truly a tennis enthusiast. Last week (11th) morning, a drizzle kept falling, around 11 o'clock. Mr. Sun drove his car to my door. I squeezed into the car and we drove all the way to the Kang Luen Village on Connaught Road. We entered a delicate two-story Western-style house and stepped into a elegantly furnished living room. We sat down on the sofa. After a while, Mr. Sun brought all his collected photos and tennis books into the living room. While drinking fragrant tea and eating chocolate, we flipped through the photos, one by one. All the tennis players in the world suddenly appeared before my eyes. In addition to praising these typical tennis postures, I also admired Mr. Sun's spirit of collecting and pasting. Several cartoons clipped from German newspapers made me feel endless amusement. When Tilden invaded Berlin, he was like a fierce tiger, scaring a group of sheep in Berlin, making them run around. No one dared to compete with him. After he chased away this group of sheep, when he left Berlin, he held a racket in one hand and a lantern in the other, still looking for his opponent, but he couldn't find one, so he left proudly. There was a famous German tennis player who was always very interested in strategy. Once, he failed in a competition somewhere. When he returned home, he drew a tennis court on the table and used geometric triangles to replay the reasons for his failure. He suddenly felt that this formula was calculated incorrectly, so he suffered this defeat. When the Davis Cup was first taken away by France, the four French players sat in the Davis Cup, triumphantly returning. The players from other countries all opened their mouths wide, looking surprised. Another scene was the Davis Cup tournament. Lacoste stood on the Davis Cup arena. Below was a long ladder. Players from Britain, Germany, Italy, and other countries all fell halfway up the ladder. Only the American Tilden had climbed to the top. Lacoste happily greeted old Tilden, but in the end, old Tilden also collapsed. During the reign of Louis XIII in France, there were four very famous swordsmen. They rebelled against the Cardinal and helped the French Queen, creating earth-shattering feats and relieving the siege of Paris, bringing blessings to the French people. This is the most glorious historical event in France. In a French tennis magazine, there is a drawing of these four immortal knights, with the modern French tennis four knights Cochet, Lacoste, Borotra, and Brugnon appearing below. Their majestic and heroic demeanor truly makes people forever feel the greatness of heroes. I looked at it for a full three hours, and my head was dizzy. I still felt the endless aftertaste upon returning. I hastily jotted down these notes, hoping to amuse the readers. (Reporter) Welcoming and Farewell Yesterday, I received two letters from Mr. Liu Shenzhan to this newspaper, one to welcome the return of the Chinese delegation and the other to bid farewell to the 20th Army football team returning west. Excerpts from both are as follows: (1) Welcoming the Return of the Chinese Delegation To General Representative Sir Liang, Coach Junfu, athletes from Changchun and all comrades, Greetings. According to reports, you comrades are returning to China on the President Coolidge this morning, arriving in Shanghai on the 16th. Feelings of welcome arise spontaneously. You comrades were able to overcome obstacles and travel far across the ocean in the midst of deep national crisis and complex difficulties, winning glory for the country and the nation, and raising the flag of the blue sky and white sun in the world-renowned, magnificent Olympic Village, creating a new record for China's participation in the World Games, breaking the Japanese propaganda for the puppet state, and exposing the Japanese barbarism and cruelty. The mission you comrades bear is of great significance and is truly serving the country. Anyone with a sense of nation and country cannot help but extend their respect to you comrades. Shenzhan is unworthy and dares not be left behind. I respectfully offer a few words to express my welcome, hoping that you will discard the short and use the long, transforming and synthesizing physical education that is suitable for the national conditions and the national character to lead the whole country and move forward. I especially pray for your good health. (2) Farewell to the 20th Army Football Team Comrades of the 20th Army football team, (Omitted)... The achievements you have worked hard for this time cannot be determined by the victory or defeat ratio. We must look at the trend set off after the west wind blows. "Physical education should be militarized" and "military affairs should be physicalized" is what you sympathize with and deeply taste. In my opinion, the two are mutually useful and cannot be separated even for a moment. The army's football team must show the spirit of the army from the football team, so as not to lose the characteristics of the army and increase people's admiration. (Omitted) I sincerely hope that what you bring back is the spirit and books of "morality" and "wisdom" besides physical education, and not the satisfaction of personal material desires. In particular, you must take the spirit of General Yang's coarse cloth short shirt as your spirit, without revealing any contradictions in personal enjoyment, which is a small model nourishing greatness. (Omitted) Secondly, it is important to carry out sports propaganda and practice to the upper-class dignitaries, and the mass sports movement to the lower-class people should be treated equally. I hope that your footprints will be filled with five counties and the whole of Sichuan, as well as the southwestern provinces and even the borders. (Omitted) I wish you good luck all the way and future efforts. <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>

Inspectors Song Yulian, Guo Ziliang, Zhou Zhenrui and others from the Supervisory Office, and detectives Chen Guangyan and others from the Detective Team, strictly guarded and defended the venue. The strict security measures were in place from 8:30 a.m. until after the meeting adjourned at 12:00 p.m. Venue Arrangement At the entrance of the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Corps, a white cloth banner reading "Shanghai All Circles September 18th National Humiliation Memorial Meeting" was hung high. In the center of the stage was a portrait of the Kuomintang's General Leader. On the east side was the meeting agenda, and on the west side were the meeting slogans. The slogans on both sides were eye-catching, such as "Compatriots across the country, unite as one!", "Eliminate the puppet organization in the Northeast!", "Punish the traitors who are pro-Japanese and sell out the country!", "Expand the anti-Japanese movement and implement economic sanctions!", "Support the Northeastern Volunteer Army fighting hard against Japan!", "Work hard on political training and construction and complete local autonomy!" Although the layout was simple, it was full of a solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere. When representatives from all walks of life entered the venue, they were given black gauze when they signed in. At the same time, Jin Xing Industrial Society also presented September 18th commemorative badges at the venue. Meeting Staff Yuan Hongjun of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Li Yongxiang of the General Labor Union, Lin Kecong of the Women's Relief Association, Yu Xiji of the Accountants' Association, and other four groups served as the presidium (the Joint Association of University Professors was absent). Shi Renzheng served as the master of ceremonies, Pan Dingyuan served as the recorder, Zhang Xianfang of the Citizens' Federation, Shen Junru of the Lawyers' Association, Lu Muqin of the General Labor Union, and Zhu Yangwu and Dong Muge of the Municipal Party Headquarters served as receptionists. Zhu Xuefan and others of the National Postal Workers' Union and the local Postal Workers' Union served as marshals. Chairman's Speech The meeting began with a speech by Chairman Yuan Hongjun, who said, in brief, "Today, representatives from all walks of life are participating in this memorial meeting, and everyone feels very sad. When we recall the September 18th National Humiliation Memorial Meeting Gate (Photo taken by this newspaper's photography department) When we recall last year's September 18th, the Japanese imperialists, under the pretext of the Nakamura Incident, occupied part of our territory in the Northeast. At that time, our Northeastern army was originally going to rise up to resist and fight the Japanese imperialists to the death, but due to orders from superiors not to resist, they had to withdraw, causing the Northeast to fall. We feel even more grief and indignation. Speaking of the September 18th Incident, it was not created suddenly last year. The Japanese imperialists had long been premeditating and actively preparing in advance. We can say that from last year's September 18th to now, we have been living through the painful days of September 18th every day. The Japanese imperialists are also constantly trying to turn the Northeast into a second Korea. Today, we are holding this meeting, hoping that everyone will unite as one, work hard to resist Japan, support the Northeastern Volunteer Army, and urge the central government to recover the lost territory, so that this memorial day will be eliminated by this time next year, so as not to lose the significance of today's meeting." Representative of the Ma Clan Wu Huanzhang, the representative of the Heilongjiang Province Chairman Ma Zhanshan, also arrived at the meeting after 10:00 a.m. and took the stage to speak, saying, "Today, all circles in Shanghai are holding the September 18th Memorial Meeting here. I am extremely saddened to participate here. Today, Chairman Ma's son Kui was also prepared to participate in this meeting, but because he was not feeling well, he was unable to come. He asked me to apologize to you all. As for the situation in the Northeast, the newspapers have already reported in great detail, so I won't go into detail. I once went to Shanghai to appeal for Shanghai's assistance, and I received enthusiastic support from all walks of life. In the middle, I returned to the north due to business, passing through Vladivostok and returning to Heilongjiang Province. I was about to arrive there when I was stopped from advancing by the Russian authorities and sent back on the original ship. In this process, I left a very deep impression in my mind and gained a very big feeling in experience, understanding that in the affairs of the world, only self-reliance and self-help can gain people's help, and only self-help can resolve all difficulties. Otherwise, even if heaven does not abandon people, it is still a way to abandon oneself. Chairman Ma has now reorganized his forces and vowed to fight to the death with the enemy to regain our dignity and determined to recover the lost territory. However, with the remaining troops, limited guns and ammunition, and supplies, even if we can charge into battle and engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, we still need the support of compatriots across the country to provide consistent assistance in order to sustain the situation. At the same time, today I read in the newspaper that the situation in Rehe is extremely tense. In fact, Japan has long been eyeing it, because the sea route to Vladivostok has been blocked and the first line of communication has been cut off. Now Japan is determined to occupy Rehe in order to cut off the response between our country's interior and the Northeast. Therefore, if we do not rush to rescue now, we will not be able to provide assistance even if we want to in the future. The Heilongjiang Provincial Office in Shanghai was established on the 15th of this month. I hope that all of you present, as well as compatriots across the country, will save money and food and rise up to provide practical assistance to the Northeast. We should know that protecting the Northeast is to protect North China, and it is also to protect China's territory. Please do not sit idly by and let the good opportunity to raise the Qing gauze curtain pass by in vain." Speeches from All Circles Then, Shen Junru, the representative of the Lawyers' Association, gave a speech, saying, "The September 18th Incident has been worth commemorating every day since it happened last year, because in this year, we have been in grief and pain every day. Today, all circles are holding this representative meeting. We are not just saying a few empty words to save the country. We need to start from practical actions in order to be effective. Since the September 18th Incident happened last year, there have been two attitudes from the government to the people. One is to advocate armed resistance. Now, let's observe from the international aspect. European countries have not only paid attention to the Far East issue after the September 18th Incident last year. In fact, they had already considered it at the London Conference ten years ago. When the London Conference was held, the United States paid the most attention to the Far East issue and proposed a plan to reduce the military equipment of Japan and the United States by three-fifths. At the same time, Japan also asked the United States to restrict the naval equipment in the Philippines. Therefore, the United States agreed to Japan's request. So, from the perspective of the international situation, a war between the United States and Japan is impossible at present. Even if it is possible, there is no guarantee. We see that people pay attention to the Northeast issue. We Chinese people only pay attention when the situation is so serious. Now, in this time of national crisis, we only have to break the bad habit of five-minute fever in the past, and everyone will fight persistently. We also hope that the government and the people will unite and resist to the death to be effective." Subsequently, Chen Peide, the representative of the General Labor Union, Shen Zuru, the representative of the National Salvation Federation of Various Groups, Yu Xiji, the representative of the Accountants' Association, and others successively gave speeches (the length of the speeches is omitted). Discussion of Proposals After the representatives finished speaking, they began to discuss the proposals: (1) A telegram was sent to the central government requesting it to sever diplomatic relations with Japan as soon as possible and to withdraw the ambassador to Japan and the overseas Chinese in Japan. The resolution was passed. (2) A telegram was sent to the central government requesting it to send troops to recover the lost territory. The resolution was passed. (3) A telegram was sent to the central government requesting it to withdraw from the League of Nations. The resolution was passed. (4) A telegram was sent to comfort the soldiers and civilians in the Northeast. The resolution was passed. (5) A telegram was sent to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty requesting them to safeguard peace in accordance with the treaty. The resolution was passed. (6) A request was made to the municipal government and the municipal party headquarters to unify the national salvation groups in the city. The resolution was passed. (7) A telegram was sent to the central government requesting it to order Han Fuju and Liu Zhennian to stop the civil war and unite against Japan. The resolution was passed. At the end, slogans were shouted and the meeting adjourned. It was already 11:50 a.m. Memorial Services in Various Institutions Municipal Government After receiving the telegram from the central government yesterday, the Municipal Government specially instructed all its staff to go to the government office as usual and held a memorial service at 11:00 a.m. All the staff of the Municipal Government, from the secretary-general to the section chiefs, gathered in the Municipal Government Auditorium on time. Secretary-General Yu presided over the meeting. Because the central government stipulated that the whole country should observe a five-minute silence at 11:00 a.m. to express mourning, the memorial service began with everyone standing up and observing silence. After the silence, Secretary-General Yu delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Mayor Wu. Everyone present was moved. Secretary-General Yu's Speech Today, we are holding this solemn and simple ceremony to commemorate the "September 18th" National Humiliation. I can't help but feel sad. When we recall this day last year, when we suddenly heard the news that Shenyang was occupied, we didn't believe it. Later, when the news came, we confirmed that it was true. We must know that Japan's actions were planned and premeditated, and they were not done in a day or two. We also know that Japan's aggression will never be satisfied with Shenyang alone. It will expand its scope to the important areas of the Northeast. Japan's actions in the Northeast this year can deeply convince us of this statement. As for the reasons Japan holds, it is for its own survival, that is, the lifeline that it sings loudly from top to bottom. Therefore, no matter what the situation in our country is, it will eventually take this action resolutely to satisfy its desires. Japan's actions clearly violate the League of Nations Covenant, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, in order to safeguard peace in East Asia and the world, our country requested the League of Nations to handle this matter fairly. After the League of Nations accepted the case, it sent an investigation team to various places in our country's Northeast and Japan to conduct on-the-spot investigations in order to seek a solution. I don't doubt the strength of the League of Nations, but I deeply feel that relying on others' help is not the way to save ourselves. Japan has resolutely and decisively recognized the puppet organization before the report has been officially published and discussed. This shows that Japan has a whole plan and will not be changed by any external interference. Therefore, no matter whether the report is biased towards our country or not, and does not straighten Japan, if we cannot unite from top to bottom to seek a way to save ourselves, I am afraid that we will not be able to wash away our shame and avenge our hatred. Looking at history, has any country declared war on another country purely for the survival of itself or for the justice of the world? Therefore, during this period of national crisis, the government should determine its diplomatic policy and defeat the enemy through negotiations with various countries. The people of the whole country should, within the scope of the law, carry out planned revenge and revenge. By this time next year, we should silently recall the achievements of a year of hard work and see to what extent we have reached. This is what I hope from my colleagues today. Mayor's Speech Today is September 18th. No one in the whole country does not feel sad, especially myself. In recent years, I have been inspecting the Northeast for a long time and have been with the people of the Northeast for many years. Now, witnessing the suffering of 30 million Northeastern compatriots, I feel even more grief and pain in terms of public affairs and private friendship. I can't directly participate in the rescue work because of my official duties, so I have more grief. In short, there are many reasons for the national crisis that constitutes today's grief, and the time is very long. Since the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, we have been constantly stimulated by the outside world for decades, but we still cannot make the people of the country thoroughly aware. Whether in politics, education, social economy, or production, there is still no significant progress. This is due to the neglect of the country's century-old plan. For example, China's national defense has not been established until now, and the doors are wide open, and foreigners have opportunities to seize at any time. How can we not feel pain? We must know that saving the country is the most difficult and arduous work in the world, and it cannot be done by just singing high-pitched tunes or making empty threats, nor can it be completed in the shortest time. From now on, saving the country and washing away shame requires the spirit of lying on firewood and tasting gall, and burying our heads in hard work. If the people of the whole country embrace this spirit, regardless of success or failure, profit or loss, and persevere, there will be a day to save the country. In a nutshell, the people of the whole country should do their best to fulfill their responsibilities, be loyal to their duties, and be content with their work. Those in the political circles should increase the effectiveness of their administration, so that politics will be on the right track and become more and more enlightened. Those who serve in education should do their best to educate their children, not only to cultivate the knowledge of young people, but also to cultivate their abilities. Capitalists and workers should work together carefully to make production develop and the country's resources abundant, and all supplies should not rely on imported goods. If we can do this, we can not only maintain the survival of the country and the nation, but also further save the country from danger invisibly. This is completely based on the position of the consistent joint efforts of all sectors of the country. For example, civil servants say that saving the country and recovering lost territory is the responsibility of the soldiers, while the people say that the responsibility lies with the government. This is a big mistake. In recent years, the new organizations of various undertakings in various countries have all been centered on national defense. Whether it is agriculture, industry, commerce, education, or government, they all have a certain scope. For example, when factories are established in peacetime, they are supervised by the state because they want to make ordinary production workshops in peacetime become munitions manufacturing sites when war comes. Not only factories are like this, but it is also true for agriculture and commerce. The so-called national mobilization refers to the simultaneous rise of all sectors, not just entrusting the government alone. If our country can organize in this way, the national situation can be saved. Therefore, saving today's national crisis depends on everyone's efforts and each person fulfilling their share of responsibility. I often encourage myself to do my duty and abide by my duties. On this painful memorial day, I especially express this statement and hope to encourage all my colleagues in the government. Songhu Garrison Headquarters Yesterday was the anniversary of the September 18th Incident. Because it was reported that reactionaries would cause trouble in various places, the headquarters ordered its troops to strictly guard all the garrisons. At the same time, the colleagues of the Garrison Department also worked all day. In the morning, Commander Dai personally led the colleagues of the Garrison Department to hold a memorial ceremony in the Grand Auditorium. Dai also delivered a speech to encourage the troops. At 11:00 a.m., he personally led all the officers to hold a silent ceremony in the Garrison Department to express his condolences. Commander Dai's Speech Dai Ji, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, delivered a speech to his colleagues in the Garrison Department at 9:00 a.m. yesterday morning, saying, in brief, "September 18th is the only painful memorial day in the history of our country. How should we save this national crisis? However, empty words cannot save the country, and high-pitched tunes cannot help the current difficulties. First of all, the people of the whole country must fulfill their national duties, make consistent efforts, unite and struggle, and then can we be effective. Therefore, I hope that my colleagues in the Garrison Department must be loyal to their duties and work hard during this time of national crisis in order to maintain local peace and political integrity. I also hope that the people of the whole country will learn from the suffering of the fall of the East Province and the difficult struggle of the Volunteer Army, and follow their conscience and do their best to help our Northeastern Volunteer Army, so that the East Province can be recovered as soon as possible and the people of the Northeast can be rescued from the depths of misery." Navy Department The headquarters of each fleet of the Gaochang Temple Navy held the anniversary ceremony of the September 18th National Humiliation at the headquarters at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Chen Jiliang, the Vice Minister of the Navy and Commander of the First Fleet, reported on the course of the September 18th Incident, and then held a moment of silence. At the same time, the Navy Guard Battalion, led by Battalion Commander Ye Baoqi, held a National Humiliation Memorial with all the officers of the battalion. All the warships of our country anchored in the Gaochang Temple Pu were flying at half-mast in mourning. Special Zone Court The First Special Zone Local Court and the Higher Second Branch Court both followed the order of the Executive Yuan yesterday. In addition to flying at half-mast, the two court presidents, Shen and Zhou, and the two chief prosecutors, Wang and Wang, convened all the promoting inspectors, secretaries, and staff of the two courts at 11:00 a.m. to hold a meeting to commemorate the event. They unanimously vowed to wash away the national humiliation to express their grief. The Higher Third Branch Court of the French Concession and the Second Special Zone Court, from the president down, all arrived at the court as usual at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Court Presidents Liang and Ying led judges and staff members to hold a memorial ceremony in the auditorium of the First Court at 10:00 a.m. They gave a speech on the course of the national humiliation. The words were very sad and ended at 11:00 a.m. Two-Road Party Headquarters The special party headquarters of the Jinghu, Huhangyong, and Huhang Railways held the "September 18th" National Humiliation Anniversary Conference at the grand auditorium of Shunzhenli, Huaxing Road, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 300 people, including all staff members of the two-road party headquarters, the two-road labor unions, and representatives of various organs and groups on the two roads, attended the meeting. For the sake of prudence, the railway bureau was specially requested to send more than a dozen railway police officers to the scene to maintain order. Chairman Chen Chengshi reported on the summary of the "September 18th" National Humiliation. The following telegrams were passed: (1) A telegram was sent to the whole country vowing to recover the lost territory and resist the violent Japanese. (2) A telegram was sent to the League of Nations requesting it to make a fair resolution on the Northeast Incident as soon as possible and to take drastic and effective measures to stop the violent Japanese aggression. (3) A telegram was sent to the soldiers of the whole country to unanimously vow to resist and defend themselves. (4) A telegram was sent to the central government requesting it to immediately order the suppression of the Northeast rebels. Cai Jinghai, Zhang Yunhe, Chen Pin and others then successively gave speeches and shouted slogans to dismiss the meeting. The Whole City Flew at Half-Mast Yesterday, all organs, schools, factories, shops, etc. in the city flew at half-mast in mourning. Therefore, although the national flag of the Republic of China with the blue sky, white sun, and red ground was flying on all the roads, it was dim and dull, and it felt even more bleak. Amusement places such as the Great World, the Small World, the Fairy World, the New New Rooftop Garden, Yong'an, Tianyun Tower, Xianshi Paradise, and Qitian, Tianchan, Yixing, Penglai, etc., as well as Central, New Central, Fu'an, Empire Guanghua, Jiuxing, Shanxi, Zhabei, Beijing, Golden, Southeast and other cinemas, all stopped business, the iron doors were closed, and it was marked "September 18th National Humiliation Memorial Day Closed for One Day." Various museums also stopped publishing various entertainment advertisements for one day in mourning. Special Martial Law in the Whole City Chinese Boundary In the Nanshi, Zhabei, Wusong, and Huxi districts, all police stations were ordered to impose martial law. All important roads were guarded by double posts. Inspectors, detectives, and female inspectors were all dispatched to inspect pedestrians. Armed police officers of the police brigade were stationed in various posts, and the car patrol team patrolled with arms. The most stringent areas were Xiaodongmen, Ximen, Laobeimen, Xieqiao, Public Sports Ground in Nanshi, Tanzhiwan, Chihama Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, Tiantongan Station, North Railway Station in Zhabei, Caojiadu, Zhoujiadu in Huxi, Lanndidu and Lujiazui in Pudong, and Paotaiwan in Wusong. On Longhua Jinyilu and Longhua Road, armed soldiers from the Garrison Headquarters set up sentry posts. At Gaochang Temple, soldiers from the Navy Department Guard Battalion were stationed. Near the Municipal Government and Xieqiao and Xuxie Roads, the security team was stationed and inspected pedestrians very strictly. The security teams in each district were dispatched with arms to patrol, and the security was very strict. Gong Xikui, the superintendent of the Public Security Bureau, also personally inspected Nanshi at 11:30 a.m. and Zhabei at 1:30 p.m. The situation was very peaceful. Concession Area All French Concession police stations, Chinese and Western detectives, were dispatched with arms. Posts were added to all important roads. The iron doors at the junction of the Chinese and Concession areas, such as Xiaodongmen, Xinbeimen, Laobeimen, Xiaobeimen, Nanyang Bridge, and Xieqiao, were completely closed, leaving only side doors for pedestrians. Chinese and Western patrolmen were stationed at each door to conduct strict inspections. Piles of barbed wire were piled up at the junction of Lujiawan and Dapu Bridge, and only Fenglin Bridge and other places were opened to allow vehicles to pass. Detectives were stationed everywhere in the Great World and Dongxinqiao. All Chinese and Western detectives from the police stations in the Public Concession were dispatched. Detectives were armed and stationed at the border to inspect pedestrians.

<p>Hongkou Area Yesterday, the section of North Sichuan Road from Hongkou to the Qiujiang Road intersection was still patrolled and guarded by the police. From the Hongjiang Road intersection to the Park Shooting Range, it was originally a Chinese territory, but because the headquarters of the Japanese Marine Corps and the headquarters of the military police were stationed there, the section was used as a Japanese military alert area. Along the way, there were groups of eight members of the Japanese Navy Special Marine Corps, led by another officer, patrolling back and forth. However, at the entrances of Xingjiazhai, Dade Li, and Yokohama Road, there were police officers from our city on guard with guns. The security in front of the headquarters of the Japanese Navy was quite strict. The armored vehicles and small tanks that were usually parked in Hyogo were driven out of the warehouse and placed on the side of the road. More than a dozen troop carriers were also parked in front of the back door of the headquarters along the Songhu Railway. Although the Japanese residents were notified in advance by the military and police authorities not to go out if there was nothing to do, there was still traffic in the Hongkou area. Traffic Situation The iron gates at the junction of China and France were temporarily closed yesterday, so French Commercial Tram Line 3 stopped running from Xiaodongmen to Ximen, Line 6 stopped running from Shiliupu to Lujiawan and only ran to Xiaodongmen, and Line 5 stopped running from the North Railway Station to Ximen and only ran to Dongxinqiao. Line 19 from Yuezhou Road to Xieqiao and Line 17 from Lan Road to Xieqiao only ran to the Great World. In order to maintain traffic, the company specially ran public buses instead. Line 18 ran from the Great World to Xieqiao. Public Concession Tram Line 14 ran from the North Railway Station to Minguo Road and only ran to Zhengjia Muqiao. Line 15 from Haining Road to Minguo Road, Line 16 from Caojiadu to Minguo Road, and Line 19 from Xiaoshadu to Minguo Road only ran to Sanyangjing Bridge. Traffic at the junction of China and France was cut off. Vehicles entering the Chinese boundary from the concession must go through Fenglin Bridge to Xietu Road, but the security team police along the road conducted very strict inspections. Orderly Tranquility The Municipal Public Security Bureau, the French Concession, and the Public Concession's police agencies received confidential reports in advance that the Communist Party would hold a memorial meeting in the open space of Binlang Road in Huxi at 10:00 a.m. yesterday and would unite with unemployed workers in the city to hold a major riot. Therefore, the Public Concession Police Station deployed armed Chinese and Western detectives in Binlang Road yesterday morning to guard the area, prohibiting pedestrians from standing in the middle of the road or walking in groups. At the time, only three or five workers were seen passing by in groups and were dispersed. Afterwards, the Chinese and Concession authorities and police agencies seized various leaflets, such as "September 18th Special Issue", "Workers' Daily", and "September 18th Letter to Workers". Fortunately, the night passed peacefully.

<h3 id="e15">Last Week's Gold Standard Continued to Rise <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<h3 id="e16">International Silver Market Fell Frequently <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<h3 id="e17">Local Exchange Market Tense <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the gold standard continued to be strong, but there were no special changes. The daily trading volume was at most no more than ten taels. The reason for the frequent rise was that the international silver market and exchange rate continued to fall, and the local exchange rate was also tense. Moreover, the swap rate increased from small to high, and people insisted on it, which greatly stimulated the short sellers, who only rushed to cover their positions. As for October, since the beginning of the week, although the silver market rose not much, it did not affect it. The opening price was 712.5 taels. Soon after, it tended to rise, and there was a slight fluctuation. It once fell to 709.5 taels. After that, the prices of British and American silver, etc., all shrank, and then exceeded 720 taels. By Wednesday, the swap trading had already started. Due to the custom of the industry, it should be advanced. However, the 15th happened to be the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, so it was done on the 14th as usual. The discount rate was still offered by the short sellers, initially only about four taels, and then on the 16th, it frequently reached as high as twelve taels, which was the arbitrary increase of the big bulls. However, the final price was within ten taels. The gold market appeared at 737.5 taels. By the close of the market, 36.5 taels, compared with the previous Saturday, increased by 23 taels and 9 qian. There was a difference of 28 taels in these four days. On this day, the 16th, November came on the market. The opening price was 718 taels. Due to the extremely tight exchange rate, those seeking it followed one after another, and it went beyond 720 taels. Later, the market became more and more sharp, reaching 28 taels and 4 qian. On the weekend, it recovered from flat to firm, resulting in 27 taels and 2 qian (the difference between the opening and closing prices was 9 taels and 2 qian). The high and low prices had a difference of 10 taels and 4 qian. Looking back, the total increase in October and November compared with the previous week was about 25 taels (excluding the swap of about 10 taels). The successive increases in three weeks were about 44 or 45 taels. As for the HSBC listing, the telegraphic transfer rate shrank by one and a half gears (375), and the US dollar was 7 jiao and 5 fen. The internal market fluctuated slightly, and eventually became firmer. The telegraphic transfer rate has shrunk by 4375, and the US dollar has shrunk by 7 jiao and a half. Some people in the gold industry have been caught short, and it has been tight for three weeks. As for the exchange rate, it has been reported to be small again. It is estimated that the British exchange rate against the US dollar fell by 1 fen and 25, and the US dollar against the British pound fell by 1 fen and 5625. The gold standard was settled at the US exchange rate, initially at 60 taels, and later at more than 70 taels. This week's spot gold standard did not成交 due to the price mismatch. The red bar initially added 8 or 9 taels, and then added 17 taels due to the large swap, and then 15 taels. According to the recent gold transaction amount, it is only more than 17,000. With this market price, it can be increased without decreasing. It is said that Guangbang Hengxing made a lot of profit in this swap. Although it was offered by the short sellers, the price offered by one side of the bulls was better than the price offered. Moreover, the big bull Yufeng always swapped out at high prices, so it made a lot of profit. Yesterday, the large bar silver continued to report a decline. If there are no unexpected twists and turns, the gold price will definitely rise again. Now, the high and low prices of British and American silver markets and exchange bills are listed below.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Last Week's Bond Market Became More Desolate</p>
<p>The Entire Week's Transaction Was Only More Than 6.3 Million</p>
<p>Price Became More Stagnant, with Mutual Rises and Falls Compared to Before</p>
<p>Last week (from September 12th to 17th), the spot and futures trading in the local Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange market was far less than the previous week. The popularity of buyers and sellers was unusually cold. The desolate situation was really rare. It was found that the spot trading for the entire week was only 53,700 yuan. Although the October futures have all been opened, the成交 was extremely rare. The September futures market was lifeless. Except for Thursday, which was the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday, the trading on the remaining days was only about 1 million yuan. The total was only 6,345,000 yuan, which was 3,850,000 yuan less than the previous week. Compared with previous years, the trading volume on one day was four or five times this number. This was because all the bonds were very clear last week. As for the trend of the prices of various bonds, although the Japanese admitted that the puppet state had become a reality through propaganda, the current situation was still lacking in new developments. Therefore, although the diplomatic阴黧 was becoming more and more serious, the general situation turned out to be very calm. As a result, the market sentiment became more and more depressed. The major players from all walks of life were watching and not moving, and even the retail investors were also uninterested. The supply and demand was extremely balanced. This was why the prices of various prices remained stagnant throughout last week. The daily fluctuation of each price was only one or two jiao. The entire week was only about five or six jiao. Compared with the previous week, the mutual rises and falls were also two or three jiao. The bond market situation is feared that it will be difficult to have a turnaround in the short term. Now, the statistics of the high and low rises and falls of various bonds in the past week are listed below (unit: yuan).</p>

<p>Last Week's Yarn Market Was in a Weak Condition</p>
<p>Silk Sales Volume Increased</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has been in a weak state for a week. The reason is that American cotton has continued to fall, causing people to be disheartened. Although buyers are struggling hard, the environment is deteriorating and it is difficult to win. Moreover, sellers have the help of foreign cotton, and their momentum is strong. There are more and more new sellers. However, the Rongxinghao bulls have not taken any action. Most people are pessimistic about the overseas situation and are selling short. Midway, the buyers have launched an action during the autumn season. Moreover, the patriotism of the southern ports is more enthusiastic than other places. Buyers are specially searching for domestic goods. The purchase of Chinese yarn by the Guangdong and Shantou gangs has gradually developed, which has brought a little bit of courage to people. The stock of 本yarn is still thin, so the falling trend is still peaceful. There is also a saying that the weather will be cooler in the future, and the production of various factories can be increased. However, it has fallen by about ten taels compared to the high price. Although there is bad news, it may be able to hold on temporarily. The key to cotton yarn is actually the largest. The gangs have bought more spot yarn than the previous week. According to the statistics of various gangs for the entire week, there were 7,341 bales. The market was roughly flat. The spot yarn was one, two, three, four, five or six qian lower than the previous week. The成交 statistics were 160,450 bales. Now, the purchase amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<p>| Gang | Bales | Gang | Bales | Gang | Bales |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Mainland | 650 | Shantou | 1,750 | Guangdong | 2,685 |</p>

<p>Last Week's Cotton Market Had a Soft Color</p>
<p>Good Domestic Weather</p>
<p>American Cotton Fell Fiercely</p>
<p>The cotton market has been very weak for a week. There are two main reasons. One is that the domestic weather is good, which is conducive to the listing of new cotton. The second is that American cotton is becoming more and more downstream, and the falling trend is severe. Therefore, a certain manufacturer is selling short independently. It is found that the amount of its short selling is about 180,000, which can be said to be very large. The pressure is especially heavy. Most retail investors are also selling short. As a result, the market is even more volatile. Fortunately, various factories have purchased foreign cotton very auspiciously this year. At present, various factories have purchased 本 cotton that needs to be shipped to Shanghai by wharfs. There is no hoarding. Moreover, the exchange rate has shrunk greatly, and foreign cotton has also risen secretly. Therefore, a sharp falling trend has not been found in the cotton standard. It is found that the source of wharfs is 7,057 bales of Yao cotton and 3,103 bales of Tongzhou. The成交 statistics of cotton standard for a week are 400,390 dan. The price of cotton standard in each month is 4 and a half qian lower than the previous week. However, there are heavy winds and rains in Hankou, and the cotton trees have been slightly damaged. American cotton is 130 pounds lower than the previous week. Now, the purchase amount and price of each factory are listed below.</p>
<p>| Cotton Type | Highest Price | Lowest Price | 成交 Amount | Deadline |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>

<p>Heshia Rice Market Turned from Sunny to Stable</p>
<p>South of Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather was sunny. The number of sources in the West Road was more than the usual number. The transaction in this street was not smooth. The arrival of fragrant粳 was surging and fell by six or seven jiao. The number of early and late rice bushels was limited. It was also soft and close to jiao. The appetite for Su Tong帮明定暗紧, and the new蘆洋尖 was extremely weak, showing a downstream trend. The demand for Bianyuan rice dan was still strong, and it rose by a jiao.</p>
<p>Xinzha</p>
<p>About thirteen or fourteen rice boats from various gangs arrived. The road to the city and the countryside was not good. The opening of various goods rose and fell limited. The new粳 and new阴元 arrived, and the sales were sluggish. The price was three chi short. The Changxi North粳 Middle Open also followed the nearly chi. However, the early and late rice slightly rose. The landlords increased the price by more than two jiao. The new杜洋尖 has no honor or disgrace.</p>

<p>The Qingping View of Last Week's Silk Market</p>
<p>New York Factory Progress Still Light Lyon Consumption Still Smooth</p>
<p>Overseas Price is Not High The Future is Still Difficult to be Optimistic</p>
<p>Last week, the local foreign bank silk market continued to show清平缘. The Japanese silk in New York was still competing for sales, and the progress of the Chinese silk factory was still not rising. The Shanghai telegrams were still fresh. The silk weaving factories in Lyon were still consuming smoothly due to the strong orders for winter silk. However, the import of Japanese silk continued to be strong, taking the opportunity to dump it. As for the selling price of Chinese silk, it was difficult to expect it to rise. The European and American hoarders in Shanghai were thinking of hoarding at low prices. The manufacturers, in view of the expensive autumn silkworm cocoon prices in Jiang and Zhejiang provinces, and the low cost of silk, did not dare to take the risk of selling it. Therefore, the 成交 of spot and futures silk in the above week was still 清. A total of more than 500 packages of yellow and white silk were sold in the entire week, and more than 400 packages of spot silk were exported. The future of the silk market is still difficult to be optimistic. Now, the market price of Chinese silk in the overseas market at the end of last week is listed below (New York per pound price unit gold yuan, Lyon per basic miscellaneous price unit francs).</p>

<p>Sugar Market</p>
<p>Wufu White Ice Has Been Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was related to the Dutch exchange gold standard. In terms of the current market land price, the 24th grade crude sand white drawing application required 14 taels and 9 qian. Therefore, the association's drawing board was still firm. The initial drawing of 24th grade ordinary crude sand white was 14 taels, 5 qian and 7 and a half fen, and later it rose to 14 taels and 6 qian. The成交 was more than 400 packages. If the remittance water gold standard is not loose in the future, it will still be expected to rise. Hao Pan had a large number of Hao Kai opening 200 boxes of Wufu White Ice, each砠price was 10 taels and 5 qian. The 客家 originally intended to扳 11 taels for this cargo. Because the current value of the autumn sales is just starting, and the needs of various places are very strong, in order to cope with the situation, they will open a batch first, and they will definitely tighten later. Also, 40 boxes of Brotherhood Ice were opened at 9 taels and 9 qian, which was 2 qian higher than before. Also, Changxing Bank opened more than 100 packages of Shantou Cotton Red Ginseng, priced at 10 taels and 9 qian. Because the goods were slightly secondary, the price was cheaper.</p>
<p>Coal</p>
<p>The Main Reason for the Slow Sales of Mark Coal</p>
<p>Mark white coal originally had a good sales market. 客帮 from other places and various restaurants in this port all liked to use it. Since the summer of this year, the sales market has sharply decreased. The original reason was the impact of the surging and falling prices of Mengshan Western Coal. Moreover, the price of Mark was also expensive due to the high cost. They had to be around 20 taels, and they were unwilling to fall lightly for a while. As a result, there were fewer and fewer tastes. There is no definite standard for the current selling price in the market. Some people call 18 taels, and some people say 18 taels and 5 qian, etc.</p>

<p>The Authority of Tan Dog No. 21 Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The news material about the death of the dog star Zero Din occupies a huge space in the newspaper; Alas! Can a person be inferior to a dog? This is called the authority of the dog. The glorious history of dogs is too numerous to mention. There are dogs who serve the Red Cross Society and help starving people in the snow; there are dogs who serve in the police station and detect huge thieves; and there are countless loyal dogs who are rumored to have rescued their masters in distress at home and abroad, seemingly more than the loyal men in the world.</p>
<p>I remember a certain pen record that the authority of dogs is better than doctors:</p>
<p>The dog kept by a certain family understood the properties of the medicine because the owner had been ill for a long time; every time after the doctor prescribed the medicine, the dog would sniff the medicine bag; if the medicine was right, the dog would show joy and wag its tail. If the medicine was not right, the dog would bark a few times, hold the medicine bag in its mouth, and throw it into the trash can. The owner was able to recover from his illness gradually because he depended on the dog, and he was not mistaken by the incompetent doctor who prescribed the wrong medicine.</p>
<p>I also remember a foreign magazine recording that the authority of dogs is better than matchmakers:</p>
<p>There is a strange custom in Serbia. All the girls who have reached adulthood choose a good day in spring and autumn to have a dinner party together; when the banquet is withdrawn, everyone puts the leftover meat bones on the table and orders the dog to chew it; whoever's meat bones the dog chews first, that person will be the first to marry; who is the second, who is the third, and who is the last, everyone listens to the dog who chews the bones and determines the order of the marriage period, and no one dares to disagree.</p>
<p>I feel here: If the dogs raised are all like this, then there will be no murderous quack doctors in society, and there will be no runaway girls who oppose matchmakers. Retrospective of September 18th Xu Bai'an</p>
<p>(1) The past is like a dream!</p>
<p>I still remember clearly: when the news of the September 18th Japanese soldiers' atrocities reached Shanghai last year, we were eating soup noodles in a small restaurant near the school. Everyone was surrounding a newspaper from the 19th, nervous and calm, indignant and silent. In the dizzy eyes, there were shocking headlines, such as Japanese soldiers bombing Beida Camp, Zang Shiyi and Rong Zhen being abducted, Wang Yizhe, the brigade commander, being killed, the Bank of Communications being robbed,... the eyes were not only dizzy, but they were almost shooting out sparks! After that, there were grandly held citizen rallies, the establishment of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, the organization of donation teams, everything, everything, was carried out enthusiastically and jumping wildly.</p>
<p>(2) How can I recall it?</p>
<p>Although the land of Northeast China has been ravaged almost entirely by the claws of the tyrannical Japanese, the millions of people across the country are using their best efforts, hoping to defeat the tyrannical Japanese and recover the lost land outside the pass. However, General Zhang Xueliang, who held the military power, refused to step out of the pass. During this period, the Japanese soldiers also came to Songhu to start the 1.28 massacre. Although they had suffered losses from the defense and attacks of the brave 19th Route Army soldiers, the shooting of those huge bombs, the destruction of incendiary bombs, the broadcasting of bombs, the fire in Zhabei, the destruction of countless houses, the tragic death of many residents, the loss of property,... All of this is naturally the Japanese people's iron-like crimes, the records of atrocities that cannot be torn down, but it is also the shame of our great Chinese nation that is difficult to煎洗, because our government ultimately lacks determination, and the anti-Japanese soldiers finally retreated due to the lack of support.</p>
<p>(3) What about the present?</p>
<p>Now, the autumn wind is萧飒, and in a blink of an eye, it is September 18th again. The Northeast has fallen into the hands of the enemy for exactly one year today. And just three days ago丨the Mid-Autumn Festival in the old calendar, the political warlords and capitalist officials manipulated by Japan on that day actually brazenly and absurdly formally recognized the puppet Manchuria they created! Although the League of Nations can also裁制 this absurd move, and the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty can also correct it, it is not guaranteed. In this day and age, except for intervening for the sake of their own conflicting interests, no one is willing to be a fool to speak out for justice and say public words to redress grievances. To save China, only our people themselves! To recover the lost land, we can only rely on our own loyalty, bravery and sacrifice! Arise, friends whose hearts have not died! Arise! Go to the outside of the pass together! Pillow Notes Huo Xueming</p>
<p>The sigh of the琴絃 broke the silent Tianye. I realized it only after waking up. But I was still lying in bed, motionless. The tears of a Korean wandering musician must be in the moonlight again; his eyelashes were wet from gazing at his homeland.</p>

<h3 id="e18">After the Reduction of Political Expenses in Hubei Province <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Education Sector Demands Exemption from Reduction</p>
<p>Submitting Reasons to Commander-in-Chief Chiang</p>
<p>(Hankou Correspondence) Hubei Province's financial expenditure is in deficit, with accumulated debts of political and educational expenses totaling 3,041,249 yuan. Combined with various loans, the total deficit amounts to a staggering 15,216,512 yuan. This time, the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters stipulated that monthly political and educational expenses should not exceed 700,000 yuan. After repeated deliberations by the provincial government, it was decided to reduce the budget from 1,094,071 yuan to 862,580 yuan, implementing a policy of reduction and consolidation. The government side is still enduring the pain to maintain the situation, but the education sector has already risen in opposition. Educational funding has already been reduced three times in recent years. The current expenditure of 276,650 yuan has reached the point where it cannot be reduced any further. If the provincial government's decision to implement a new budget with an 80% reduction, reducing it to 221,320 yuan, is carried out, it will be impossible to maintain educational affairs. Moreover, the recent accumulation of unpaid educational expenses, which have not been issued for June, has caused great panic in the lives of principals, faculty, and staff of various schools. If further reductions are made, they will be left starving. Therefore, representatives were elected some days ago to petition the provincial government, requesting that the status quo be maintained. On the afternoon of the 14th, at 4:00 PM, Chen Dejiong, Xia Zhengsheng, Wang Yizhou, and Tian Yisheng were selected to bring a petition to Commander-in-Chief Chiang's headquarters to present their difficulties. Chiang sent acting Chief of Staff Zhu Shaoliang to receive them. First, Chen Dejiong, representing the entire education sector, expressed deep appreciation for Chiang's successful suppression of the Red bandits. He then presented three points: (1) Education in Hubei has been reduced three times in the 17th, 20th, and 21st years [of the Republic], which is only one-third of the level in provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Recently, there have been six months of accumulated unpaid expenses, and the difficulties have reached an extreme point. (2) The budget for educational institutions is inherently less generous than that of administrative agencies. Furthermore, administrative agencies can be reduced and consolidated simultaneously, while educational institutions cannot be reduced or consolidated; only reductions are possible. Given the magnitude of the accumulated unpaid expenses, there is virtually no room for further reduction. The headquarters previously instructed the provincial government to reorganize Hubei's finances, emphasizing the importance of maintaining both education and security while practicing thrift. Although the provincial government has slightly different reduction standards for educational and administrative expenses, items such as overseas study fees, boarding fees for normal school students, subsidies for orphans, and internship fees cannot be reduced in practice. Moreover, the operating expenses of various schools are already very meager. With the current high prices, further reductions will make it impossible for schools to operate. (3) The Executive Yuan's 53rd meeting resolved that centrally administered educational and cultural institutions would receive full payments starting in July. Commander-in-Chief Chiang's order to the provincial government to reduce political expenses also shows a special intention to protect education. He requested that the original intention of protection be upheld and that Hubei's educational expenses be approved based on the budget approved by the Hubei Provincial Government in the 20th year [of the Republic], without further reductions, so that Hubei's educational undertakings could maintain their current status. After Chen's statement, acting Chief of Staff Zhu Shaoliang replied, promising to forward it to Commander-in-Chief Chiang for consideration. (September 14th)</p>

<p>Luo Jialun, President of National Central University, announced before taking office his plan for the university. The first step is a period of stabilization, followed by development. Now that the organizations of various departments and faculties are in place, it has entered a period of stability. The future development plan is to first expand the library. The current university library only lends books to university faculty, staff, and students. The future plan is to expand the library and open it to the public, allowing scholars who are seeking professional development to have access to reading opportunities, and improve Chinese culture. The second is to expand the campus to Beijige, such as using the viewing platform to cooperate with the astronomy department, and other plans. Although it is related to funding, having these goals will ensure it will be achieved one day.</p>

<p>Since the China Vocational Education Society initiated the monthly donation from salaries to support the Northeast Volunteer Army, and abstained from lunch on September 18th to donate the saved food expenses to help the compatriots in Northeast China who were in distress, letters of approval and donations have poured in from all sides. Mr. Wang Qizhang, a famous doctor in this city, sent a letter to the association expressing his views, which were published in yesterday's newspaper. The association has now received a letter from Mr. Mu Ouchu, a leader in the industrial and commercial sector and a director of the association, stating that he strongly approves of the two methods initiated by the association and has already implemented them separately. From now on, he will save 30 yuan per month from household food expenses to support the Northeast Volunteer Army until the lost territory is recovered. Since Japan recognized the puppet state of Manchuria, its ambition to annex has been completely exposed. All Chinese people are indignant and determined to resist permanently, so that the enemy's schemes will not succeed, and the lost territory will eventually be recovered. This is the responsibility of all Chinese people. The Northeast Volunteer Army has risen up to resist and has repeatedly thwarted the enemy's advance. If all patriots, like Mr. Mu, practice thrift and actively support them, then recovering the lost territory will not be difficult.</p>

<p>Scotland's Lineup: (Goalkeeper) McClarn, (Defenders) Grant, (Center Backs) Klafene, Jones Easton, Tweef (Forwards) Crawford, Stephenson, McGregor Leith, McFee, King</p>
<p>Ireland's Lineup: (Goalkeeper) Scott, (Defenders) Cork, Folden, (Center Backs) Farleyon, Jones, Gaotai (Forwards) Mikel, Presdre, English Miller Kai Lai</p>
<p>Excellent Goalkeeping by the Irish Team: Although Irish goalkeeper Scott repeatedly displayed his goalkeeping skills, the sharpness of the Scottish forwards was extraordinary, repeatedly breaking through the center back line. Their victory was largely due to this. Two minutes into the game, Scotland's left wing King received a pass from Crawford and immediately scored the first goal.</p>
<p>Halftime Score 2-0: The Scottish forwards continued to put pressure on and ravaged the Irish defense line, but could not break through Scott's goal. However, the Irish left wing Kai Lai fiercely shot, but was saved by goalkeeper McClarn. This ball did not go in. Scotland's McFee dodged Cork and scored the second goal. At halftime, the Scottish team led 2-0.</p>
