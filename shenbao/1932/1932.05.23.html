<h3 id="c1">郵務職工罷工平議彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海郵務員工爲維護郵制鞏固郵基醖釀己久之救郵運動突於昨日起罷工先於上月底擬具方案向交部呈請裁併儲匯局停止航空公司補助。郵政經濟專養郵政。實施特别會計保持郵政制度等項。籲求容納。此次運動。純爲救濟郵政。主張旣爲正大。態度亦極光明。然而籲請之結果。竟不准行。卒以激起昨日之罷工。使交通阻滯。全社會蒙受其累。是誠爲一大不幸事。</p>
<p>我國郵政在往歲年有嬴餘計共積存三千數百餘萬元。郵政旣己走上軌道。邽基亦極爲鞏固。近數年來。以官僚政治之侵入。位置私人。濫用公欵。添設駢枝機關。於是年有虧蝕。浸且不能自存。郵制日益紊亂。郵基日益動摇。而當局不力謀整頓。反增加郵資。以增重社會一般平民之担負。因是不僅爲曉其内幕之郵務員工所深痛。國人亦早己怨聲載道矣。</p>
<p>儲匯局之分立。本非得計。除上海設有總局漢口分局一所而外。餘都附設於各地郵局。歷來各地郵局兼辦儲匯。極爲妥善。則上海漢口兩處。亦無分立之必要。如爲安置私人駢指分立。結果則私人肥囊。公則蒙害。故實施裁併。以杜絶弊寳。以减少開支以统一郵政。誠爲救濟郵政之要圖。至於航空事業。固極應提倡。然亦應另籌的欵維持。郵局僅可津貼郵遞一部分之補助。今中國歐亞兩航空公司。均仰賴郵局維持。補助無己日。虧空亦無己時。其削弱郵基。亦極顯然。停止補助。另籌的欵。俾郵政不受其累。蓋亦亟有必要。</p>
<p>二十年來。我國政治。棼如亂絲獨有郵政尙能几立於風雨飄摇之局勢下。不受政治之牽閙。而日趨於發逹。無他。蓋以郵政獨立之故。今不增而爲官僚政治所侵入。張去李來。人存五日京兆之心。但圖利己。不顧郵政之前途。故郵政乃日益敗壤業務乃日益衰落。吾人認爲就鞏固郵基而言。郵政之出入第一步至少應能兩兩相抵。第二步則應斥餘利。盡景擴充内地郵務。以利平民。蓋以郵養郵實爲根本原則而今日我國内地窮鄉僻擯之郵政。則尤亟有待於發展也。至應如何實施特别會計。保持郵局制度。亦均爲今日不容刻緩之要圖。</p>
<p>吾人對於郵務員工之救郵運動。雖極表同情。但以此罷工。而阻滯交通。則實爲一極不幸事。交通爲社會之動脈交通一日停滯。則社會一日大受其累故今日亟應雙方開誠從長商討共謀正當之解决。得以早日恢復常態。以固郵基。以利社會。而絶不容各走極端。使事態愈趨於擴大。淺成不可收拾。吾人旣盼郵政能早日改良。尤盼郵務員工能早日復工。</p>

<p>交通部昨對上海郵務職工兩會提出鞏固郵基方案之理由、關於郵政儲金匯業局各點、辯正如下、（一）關於儲匯局任用非郵員問題、理由至爲明顯、蓋郵務知識、固非普通一般人所能了解、而金融投資各問題、亦絶非郵員所能兼通、就儲金言、非徒收付儲欵之謂、其利率之伸縮、運用之利害、以及市塲經濟之趨勢、商業經濟狀况、均有密切關係、匯兌業務、亦非僅撥付匯票之謂、如匯率高低之斟酌、欵項之調據、非熟悉商情不爲功、且國外匯兌、尤非夙有研究、具世界金融之知識者、不能酌量盈虛、綢繆未雨、設立專管儲匯之機關、選任專門人才、正如此也、除總局及京滬潢各分局不得不用專門人才外、尋常業務、因仍由各郵局辦理、至該工會謂行見儲匯欵項、均歸於郵政毫不相干之人管理、而一面仍用「郵政」二字、而稱爲郵政儲金匯業總局、枉使郵政及其人員擔負責任、自非事理之平等語、具見該工會偏見之深、蓋郵政爲一種事業之代名詞、固非一部份人所能包辦者也、郵政儲金匯業總局辦理郵政儲金匯兌事務、何以不能用郵政兩字、實難索解、換言之、郵政總局之職工、可稱爲郵員、郵政儲金匯業局人員、亦爲國家辦理郵政一部份事務、在公家視之、亦郵員也、何得枉分界限、至人員隨政治而轉移一節、實屬不明眞相、蓋機關之高級職員、其任務爲籌畫業務、决定方針、高級人員、雖略有更迭、容或有計畫之改革方針之不同、執行者固多舊人於業務無妨也、至交替愈常、責成愈混、尤爲揣測之詞、交替有手續、有賬冊、責任顯然、何謂愈混、郵局職員、亦非歷久不調動者、交接清楚、亦未見其責成之愈混也、（二）郵政儲金匯業總局、逐漸將郵局人員送回郵局一節、殊多誤會、此次儲匯局將保險儲金兩副處長咨回郵政者、總局任用、係副處長一職完全裁撤、并非爲减少郵政人員、現在儲匯總局、而有多數郵政人員服務、逐漸送回之說、不知何所根據、且尋常業務、均仍由各地郵局兼辦、國際誤會、不知何所謂也、（三）郵政儲金匯業經局此次裁撤副處長、裁併處長、無非爲國難期間、節减經費、并非事務清簡、並須用人、實本局人員、種刻苦犧牲精神、少用人、多作事而己、若謂歸併郵政總局、更爲撙節、應先明瞭分設之意義、茲不再述、至日本儲金己逹三萬萬元、故事務增繁、乃有分立之事、我國儲金不及三千萬元、絶無分立之必要等語、須知我國郵政儲金在郵政總局管理之下、未見發逹、故有設專管機關力行提倡之必要、該工會此種誤解、正如當年郵局設立之初、有人指信局事務尙未發逹、故郵局設立亦無必要同一幼稚也再須聲明者無論郵政局或郵政儲匯局、均爲國家作事、爲人民謀福利、儲匯局亦係辦郵政一部份事務、談不到利用郵局信用等語也、（四）各國情形不同、研侒他國成規、以資借鏡、固爲事業進步之要素、然不知本國之需要、只知抄襲他國成法、則毫無價值矣、日本儲匯局不兼營銀行業務、所有儲金大部、均投資於證劵公債、故無須設立分局、謂爲絶對的駢枝機關、實不可解也、（五）關於兼辦儲匯之郵政人員、其賞罰升降、均仍按郵局舊章辦理、儲匯局不過參加意見、仍由郵政總局執行、所以如此者、以彼等雖仍隸屬郵政總局、實兼辦儲業事務、儲匯總局不得不有管理也、至儲匯總分局職員、則係完全隸屬儲匯局人員、郵政總局自無須過問也、至郵政所有欵項、郵政總局不能經管一節、毫無根據、所謂透支、係郵政總局一時周轉不靈、不得不向儲匯局移挪應用、任何金融機關、均有此項辦法、何足爲怪、總之儲匯局之設立、不但未糜費郵欵、實爲郵政謀得不少之利益、所有儲匯局純益、亦經完全撥歸郵政總局應用、事實俱在、不待辯正也</p>

<p>（四）</p>
<p>我如何能不悲哀呢？一同被我敲醒起來種田做工的人，於今白日當天，有的是在興高彩烈的「吃午飯」，有的是在愁壯皺額的「無飯吃」。我想到這裏，連手兒都抖了起來，何能再有力量去敲這悽慘之鐘？然而我現在也没有勇氣痛痛快快的向和尙辭職，因爲靠敲鐘吃飯的，若不敲鐘，便没得飯吃。敲吧！忍心的敲吧！從此我所敲出來的鐘聲，不再代表有飯吃的人的歡呼，而是没飯吃的人的歎息。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>我不該把話語拉得太長。鐘兒旣是要敲，自不得不考究敲的方法。天晴的午鐘似乎是能敲得準確了四陰天怎麽辦？夜裏又怎麽辦？這些的確是使我煩心的問題？</p>
<p>我小時就聽說古人用漏壺報時。一天下雨看見屋簷水一滴一滴的滴下來，便想用這個道理試做一個漏壺。不久，我是有相當的成功。我做了一個圓筒式的壺，裝滿了水，壺底開了一個小孔，讓水一滴一滴的流下來。壺高二十四寸，代表二十四個時辰。每寸又平分爲二，代表四十八個小時。可以用兩天兩夜。第一次要對準太陽射影在午線時，纔讓水兒開始滴，滴到大約十二寸的地方即是次日中午，滴到最後之一滴便是後日之中午。陰天夜裏都用得着牠。可是用這東西報時不容易準確。水高壓力大滴得快，水低壓力小滴得慢。天氣乾燥或潮濕都影響牠的快慢。我起初完全信用牠往往爲牠所誤。如果製造得巧，運用得妙，纔能得牠一些帮助。這是要屢試屢騐之後方才有此結果。但那夜裏最準確的時計不是壺裏的水乃是天上的星。平時我是依着天上星宿之運行來敲我的晚鐘和我的曉鐘。</p>

<h3 id="c146">讀過的書忘記了是人生最苦的事 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 賴北</p>
<p>讀外國書不外乎說理，述事兩項。其實演說也在說理，述事。所謂Belle　Oration「精關的演說」，也在拿意思逹得透，表顯出覺富的情感和深刻的思想來，使人感動，勸人爲善。戲子做戲，祇呌人解悶，發笑。現在流行的演說，也祇在博得聽衆拍手，呌好的采聲，未免同戲子一樣，不呌人去作深長的思索，不呌人可歌，可泣，未免失去了演說的意義。</p>
<p>中國書述事最好的要算是太史公的史記。吾師晁德蒞，曾經這樣說過：「太史公的筆法連外國都趕不上，史記筆法，簡括明透，用三言兩語來描冩史實，可算得了述事之三昧。」</p>
<p>讀中國書專重誦讀，，所以很人人能從背誦中引經典故。從前有一位孫登善，是浙江的翰林公，他是張香濤（子洞）的得意門生，他記性眞好，連十三經都能從頭背到底，眞不容易，這是吾很佩服的。奇得很，書讀得多了，有時竟會忙記得乾乾凈凈，有時僅留一些影子。其實，外國文字和中國文字似乎是兩件東西。有時外國書讀得多了，想執筆冩一些中國文字，連句子都想不起來。吾苦得很，外邊人來徵求題詞，賦詩，吾就要絞腦瀝血，腦子裏空洞得好像抽屜一樣，必須一隻一隻抽出來，在忘記得乾乾凈凈的書本裏去找影踪。（翰按：相老虛懷若谷，其實他的記性很强，他常能指出古人言的奥妙和矛盾。）</p>
<p>吾看，讀過的書忘記了，是人生最苦的事。</p>
<p>昨日本文標題「活囫圇了結。」係囫圇呑了結」之誤。特此史正。</p>

<p>— 華女士</p>
<p>五月十九日晨八時。政府人員及新聞記者雲集於聨社。準備出發。接管淞滬路西江灣。通行證繕明限十八人。各記者竟無揷足餘地。相顧愕然。金雄白來最遲。措手不及。神色最着急。許心一到最早。己有接洽。態度最泰然。餘則議論紛紛。有謂撤退。有謂衝鋒。莫衷一是。結果同行。馬崇淦車當前驅。各車須緊隨勿失。庶得打破路由盤詰等難關。詎意余車旣特緩。駛者復不善其術。遂落伍。江紅蕉張有德恐迷路。消息無着。急煞閙煞。促駛者開足馬逹。奈車夫滿身大汗。無濟於事。近新世界。紅燈一閃。前車疾馳而過。頓失視線。於是前不見古人。後不見來者。獨輪徬徨。各人無不搔首焦灼。怨張三。怪李四。幸馬氏車輛俟候於虹口花園。始各釋然。</p>
<p>江灣面積九十方里四分。六千一百零四戸。七千一百餘幢房屋。今則十九被燬。全家損害己登記者逹二千六百十四戸。百貨闐肆之大街。己成一片焦土。無屋倖存。曩視爲風景幽美富有西歐瑞士色彩之江灣。茲若大戰後人跡滅絶比利士之死市。沿途日軍絡繹開拔。常報以殺相之臉面。勞働大學鎗痕纍纍。斷牆前架有日軍槍械子彈。周君站其傍。各記者爭爲攝影。孰知兩日軍官陡然下車。耀武揚威。大批照相機幾瀕於危。大陸報記者李君手快眼快。攝獲一幀。此照價值。當倍尋常矣。</p>
<p>十一時半雙方及中立國代表在文化學院日司令部。行交替儀式。簽訂移交書。日代表赤澤與我方戴。梁。李委員握手。飲香檳酒言别。噫。中國領土旣未移交。何來接收。天下滑稽之事。莫過於是矣。十二時。費昆年醫師與余雇小車出鎭北。擬深入内地。憑弔戰蹟。一路鳥啼花落。水綠風清。令人起「故國山河在城春草木深」之感。見科村一市校。校役云該校曾被日軍所佔。十八日臨行携去抗日設計沙箱一隻。逆料其運歸。剌激國人。典籍則蕩然無存。桌椅風琴。不翼而飛。藩籬盡撤。玻窗全碎。操塲之萋萋芳草。如囚犯之頭髮。叢長凌亂。不堪涉足。撫今追昔。不覺泫然。復西行至西唐村。但見廬舍悉被日機轟炸殆盡。觸目所睹。無非殘垣廢墟。焦木瓦礫。鄉人携幼率婦。經營草屋。如春燕銜泥。辛苦萬狀。面皆反映其心中之悲劇。正不知涕涙何從。市立陶灣小學亦葬身其間。劬勞締造。同遭浩刦於一旦。其摧殘文化之慘酷。甚於嬴秦之焚書。此誠吾國民之致命傷也。</p>

<p>國府考試院院長戴季陶，在西安陪都演講，被學生毆辱，……近幾天報上都有這麽一段紀載。這班後生小子，竟敢藐視黨紀，侮辱「黨中之元老」，此無異摧毁了「黨的尊嚴與神聖」。其實黨是否值得「尊嚴與神聖」？是另一問題，但就「黨中元老」來閒談。</p>
<p>無無任何國的政黨，總有所謂「元老派」，我國的國民黨，並不是例外，而且元老也何止一人？記得近年來每次由黨爭而召内戰，在醖釀之時，各個元老奔走各方，疏通調洽，竭其息事寗人之能事，然結果仍不免於一「戰」，格於情勢惡劣，自亦難乎其爲元老！自九一八國難爆發，直到如今，政府坐令割地喪權，在萬無應付辦法之下，而「黨中元老」，只是忍痛逍遥，竟無一人肯仗義執言，解决國難！除不忘「主人翁」地位的愛國民衆，痛哭呼號以外，國政幾乎無人顧問。嘿！「黨中元老」，對内對外，如此如此，還有何說？所以戴氏受辱，原是平凡的反應，有什麽希罕？</p>

<p>瀏河楊林口七丫口。同爲沿長江之要塞。明萬歷間倭宼内犯。沿海之奉賢南匯。（其時奉賢爲婁縣南匯爲上海尙未分縣也）沿江之太倉常熟均爲倭寇蹂躪之區域。朝命戚繼光率師剿寇。駐大軍於匯角。沿部設烽火墩。直逹杭州。計一百五十三墩。南匯之三墩。舊址猶存在。凡遇倭艦泊岸。舉火爲號。以通軍報。太倉黃渡一帶。倭寇乘虛而入。屠殺極慘。（考今之所謂眞正黃渡人祇有章金王萬等四姓）鄉民避往章堰青龍廟四鄉。倭寇追踪而至。青龍廟所供奉之韋陀神。顯聖於雲端。嚇退倭寇。其時戚繼光聞警。帶領全師兵艦從江口衝入。四面兜剿。倭宼全滅。時人嘉其功。遂名之曰戚爺口。迨及後世。以訛傳誤。竟以七丫口名之。殊失古人紀勛景仰之意也。誌之以與熟於地理者。一參考之。</p>
<p>記者按此次日軍内犯。黃渡人咸奔章堰。得邀幸免。因此三月十五日之青龍廟香訊。盛極一時。蓋亦有因。</p>

<p>往時京曹雅謔以駱驼喻翰林官。謂其高視緩步。有相類者。又其羣络纆。能礙行人。有似翰林之結黨援。此語蓋明代己有之矣。蛇之爲物也。當雪虐風饕之候。有任重致遠之能。龐然巨軀。氄毛深厚。具藹然可親之度。實北方之神畜。凡貸煤者。必以此物運致。由西山至城内。秋冬之季。常晝夜遇之。約十駝爲一隊。穿鼻以繩。連綿不絶。最後一駝。項懸鉅鈴。則前引之人。但聽鈴聲。可知駝之無恙。不勞照管。其聲重濁而緩。每當霜清風緊。自爲唱答。令人悠然如聞古出塞曲也。若道遇駝鈴。復逢汽車笛響。則一新一舊。一急一緩。所示時代之差。絶遼遠矣。吾意駝鈴可代表北方之民族性。而駝隊與汽車並行道中。亦足代表北都文化之新舊雜陳。並行而不悖也。駝至四五月間。毛落見膚。瘦骨嶙峋。狀殊慘怛。市上漸不多見。更熱則不能出矣。一至秋風稍厲。新毛便生。輙復煦然有回春之意。故此物不獨不能踰河。即趙魏間亦不可致。其性殊也。凡䭾煤以麻袋。引駝之人手足面目皆被煤汚。謂之煤黑子云。</p>

<p>第八回　無邊哀怨懴情中難期曠逹　極度聲歌行樂裏得覩威嚴</p>
<p>話說梁笑雲回得家來。見魏卓謀己與安玉田在書室裏坐定。並說是李問霞有覆信托魏卓謀帶到。就急於討要這封信一觀。魏卓謀隨手在茶几上取過一頁信箋。攤開來說道。這上面冩的很簡單。剛才玉田己看過了。不妨就由我吟一徧與你聽。以下還有許多未盡之辭。李問霞統請我代爲口述呢。信上潦草數行。寥寥百十字。極像個隨手的便條。說是你的信我己讀過。前約忽爾中變。初亦不免驚詫。繼而念你是迫於情勢。終可諒解。我旣於你無益。便不應居中作梗。誤卻你的前途。今别無他言。惟有退避。前約亦當然作罷。無有異辭。支票一紙奉還。餘情槪托魏先生面逹。順祝玉田先生曁笑雲女士賢伉儷幸福。若單就表面上這幾句話看。這位李女士誠可謂最能作逹觀了。但並非我老魏自吹。實際上還是虧得我能言善辯。方才將伊勸服。起初伊去到公寓裏。從茶房手中接到玉田冩給伊的信。簡直是氣憤填胸。幾次三番的要找到你們這門上來。單尋玉田問罪。就是我初去見伊。伊也是對我哭着閙着。說什麽法律解决與登報質問。經我掉三寸不爛之舌。向伊細細開導。天地聞旣成的事勢不可轉移。人類中萬變的愛情不能勉强。玉田的新結合。與玉田現時的本身利益有關。果是眞愛玉田。便應該體諒玉田這份難處。若徒然意氣用事。枉自多傷感情。結果還是不能復合。又或縱能再合也仍是於彼此無益。不能解决現勢上的困雖。也萬難維持到久遠。便又何必多此一舉。幸伊究是個極有夙慧的。將我這番寓有大哲理的名言。前後思索過一番。霍然醒悟。就自願勉爲其難。肯做那情塲上大仁大勇的犧牲者。但附帶還請我替伊說幾句。無論玉田對伊怎樣。伊仍是很愛玉田的。除了本其十二分的至誠。禱祝你們萬事無圓滿以外。伊郤抱定宗旨。我行我素。誓以獨身主義。永遠紀念伊與玉田過去的那一番幻夢般的情愛。且爲了保持伊獨立的人格。從今自行奮鬥。對於任何人都不願依賴。故不能不退還你們那張支票。以避免波此金錢買賣愛情的嫌疑。等將來伊奮鬥得稍有成就之後。固也可勉徇笑雲的盛意。仍互相交往的維繫相當的友誼。不過一時還談不到這。應請你們二位也多多的見諒。</p>

<p>物質見光後，能在暗室内繼續發光者，多係鹼土金類之硫化物所成，若在鹼土金之硫化物内，再加以適當的别種化合物，且可製成各種紅綠紫藍的夜光質，有種錶上的指針與數字，雖在黑夜亦能認識，即是夜光質應用在工業上的一個例子，他的造法有種種，把他簡單的介紹幾個在下面，</p>
<p>（一）紫色夜光質：石灰或蚌壳灰粉二○·○格，硫黃粉六·○格，澱粉二·○格，研細和匀，再滴入硝酸鉍Bi（Ｎo3）５○·五格溶於一○○竰酒精與少許鹽酸之溶液，裝入耐火罐内，燒之至赤熱二十分鐘，冷後研成細粉，再熱十五分鐘，但須注意，勿使熱度過高而致熔化，</p>
<p>（二）深藍色夜光質：石灰二○·○格，輕養鋇Ba（ＯＨ）２二○·○格，硫黃六·○格，硫酸鉀K2　SO4硫酸鈉Na2so4各一·○格，炭酸竰　Ｌi2Co3二·○格，硝酸鉍溶液二竰，（濃度與第一法同）硝酸銣Rb　No3　溶液二，（濃度爲一與一百分水之比），配好後，如前法加熱，即可製成，</p>
<p>（三）白色夜光質：硝酸铋○·四格，食鹽二·五格，硫黃花六二·○格，炭酸鍶Sr　Co3　六五·○格，結晶炭酸鈉Na2Co3roH2O四·○格，混和入耐火罐内，上覆澱粉一層，燒之至赤熱，五鐘後取出，白色夜光質即成，</p>
<p>（四）淡紅色夜光質：蚌壳灰一○○，○格，煆乾的海鹽末二十五格，硫黃花六○·○至一○○·○格，混合置耐火罐内燒至赤熱，再入硫化鍶SrS二○·○格，再熱之，冷後成淡紅色夜光粉，如將硫化鍶換爲硫化鋇BaS，則得綠色，夜光質，注意：此物質須裝入玻瓶，藏於暗處保存，</p>
<p>（五）錶面夜光質：取硫化鋅沈澱ZnS入耐火罐内封開罐口，燒至白熱，再以少許銅質鉛質或（銀質均可）加入，和匀，取與硫化鋅重量成千分之一之Ｍesothorimbromid溶於水内，將此溶液滴入冷至百度下之盛有硫化鋅的耐火罐内，連同耐火罐置於熱水鍋内温乾，研粉與加拿大樹膠調合并加少許Ｘylol在内，即可用，</p>
<p>（六）在硫黃六·○格炭酸鍶四○·○格，炭酸鋰一·○格，硫化砷As2　S3一·○格，加入Thallsnitraf溶液，則可製淺綠色，此外黃色，赭色均可製，篇幅太長，故缺，</p>

<h3 id="c170">放工的時候 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>人類一生是不平等的，但人爲的不平等，竟比天賦的不平更是厲害，公館裏的太太小姐們的冩意生活不必說，當舞女們完了她竟夜的賣笑生涯，在晨光曦微之中，睡眼惺忪，回家的時候，正是絲廠裏的女工，拿了飯貝，到絲廠中去工作的時候，而女工和舞女的生活，其中又有絶對的不同，在一般女工看來，舞女生涯，好比己是神仙下凡了，</p>
<p>因爲在我們的校舍後面，有三四家的絲廠，所以我對於女工們生活，不無相當的透視，東方作魚肚色時，我們正在濃濃酣睡的當兒，後面的擾雜之聲，會每天打破我們的好夜，她們是六點鐘開始工作，距離遠的，三四點鐘就要起來燒飯，</p>
<p>她們走進了絲廠以後，直要到午後六時才放工，中間除了一點鐘的吃飯時間以外，每天要做十一小時的工作，好比牛馬似的替廠主聚歛，她們的生活，當然是再苦没有，但在她們自己看來，也不覺得有什麽苦痛，很安樂的一天天的過去，因爲她們在工作的時候，自有一般廠裏的職員和她們戲嬉和玩笑，而她們的嘴，也操練得非常的老練，不拘風流或穢褻的話，都能向男子們對答如流呢，在她們看來，這也許在勞苦中得到安慰吧！</p>
<p>最熱閙的時候，當然是放工的當兒，早上上工的時候，她們是零零落落進廠的，但放工是一起出來的，那時她們因爲一天的勞動後，好到家去休息，面孔上都呈露着笑容，很興奮的携着飯籃出來，和上工的時候，一種垂頭喪氣，没精打彩的態度，齊巧成了一個反比例，「照弟」！「林弟」！「根弟」！「照弟篤娘」·「林弟篤阿姊」！一片熱閙的聲音，充滿了街市中的空氣，</p>
<p>遊手和好閒浮滑的少年，他們從經騐上，也早己知道了絲廠放工的時間，到了六點鐘之前，不約而同的會集中於絲廠的門口，守候這們女工出來，年老的女士，當然可安然無事，但年輕的比較時髦一些的女工，當她們三個一起，兩個一堆的走出來的時候，便不免受他們的包圍，任意的調笑，她們有的如小鳥看見餓應般的逃竄着，有的爛浮屍丨促狹鬼丨的一片笑駡聲，但他們被駡之下，非但不發火氣，反而顯露着笑容，似乎在希望她們多駡幾聲，以爲己得到了相當的勝利，</p>
<p>他們之中，有幾個還要騎了脚踏車，有意走得很慢，去擋她們的去路，她們走到那裏，車子踏到那裏，這些事情，除了停工的日子以外，在我們的校舍四周，每天要發現一次，</p>
<h3 id="c171">生意經街頭測騐之一 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>在廚窗外張望的時間</p>
<p>近來商店的競爭，日見劇烈，而結果，商人對於廚窗學的進步，竟有驚人的成績，我們在繁華的城市中，熱閙的街道之上·覺得兩面的商店廚窗裏，陳列的東西，大家勾心鬥角，花樣的翻新，佈置的奇特，每天都在變化之中，因爲近世的商人，己確切的知道，如果對於廚窗學不考究，便會不能誘服路人的停留而觀望的，營業方面，也許爲因此而失敗，所以對於廚窗學却不可不加注意呢！</p>
<p>廚窗學的進步，的確收到了偉大的效果，你看每家商店之外，隨時會有不少的路人，停了步在觀望那廚窗裏的東西，那麽平均每個人在窗外觀望的時間，竟究有多少呢？這當然也是一個有趣的問題，據說窗外觀看的時間，平均男子每人比女子少十分之三秒。</p>
<p>這個測騐的結果，是經過了二年之久，統計了九、○七一人而得來的，結果，我們己知道平均每個路人，在廚窗外面張望的時間，是十八秒十分之七，女人在窗外觀看的時間，是每人十七秒十分之六，倘然她和了另外一個女人在同行，觀看廚窗的時間，便會增加到二十秒，一個男子如果和一個女人在同行，他們在廚窗之外，平均要觀望了二十秒十分之九，所以我們在九、○七一人中，便可得到下面一個統計：</p>
<p>一個女人在單獨的行走一七·六秒一個男人在單獨的行走一七·三秒兩個女人　二○·○秒男人和女人　二○·九秒女人的時間，這是無疑的，大都化費在窺望那珠寳店的廚窗；而男人，大都是在書店的廚窗外面觀望着，在這種地方，他們平均要耗去二十九秒的時光，算是最長的觀望了。</p>

<p>— 澤永</p>
<p>有一天下午，天氣很是熱悶，我便獨自一個人，很無聊的到某某公園去散心。</p>
<p>在那一角綠陰深處的公共椅上，坐了一對摩登式的青年男女，他們倆，正在相依相偎的，大談其情語，我不覺好奇心大動，便偷偷的躱在這株樹後，私聽他倆的窗窗私語，那個女子先問道：「密史脫何，你今天爲什麽這們的不快樂啊？</p>
<p>「因爲昨天我的父親對我說，己替我和别一個女子訂了婚，並且下月就要舉行結婚禮了！」這是那男子的回答。那末你就和那個女子結婚好了！」女的說了這話，好像有些帶醋意的口氣。</p>
<p>「呀！密史馮！請你快不要懷疑，我腦子裏除了你以外，無論甚何，不與别一個女子結婚的，因爲你才是我心坎中的安琪兒喲！」那青年便把這話來安慰她。</p>
<p>「旣然這樣，那末你應該要和你的家庭脫離關係了！」</p>
<p>「不……不我不敢和家庭脫離……」那青年歇了一位，便道麽的喘着說。</p>
<p>「爲什不能脫離呢？」</p>
<p>「我若脫離了家庭，便斷絶了經濟」</p>
<p>的來源啊！」</p>
<p>我聽到了這裏，不覺拍腿三嘆，因歸家錄之，投於本刋，以資一般青年男女戀愛之研究。</p>
<p>按我看見了這張稿子，便發見近日青年的一種普通謬誤心理，現代婚姻，原以自由爲原則，固是不差，若青年己有了心中的安琪兒，父母偏欲與另一女子强行結婚，這原是父母的不是，在現在時代，父母不應該再去爲子女越俎代庖，惟青年須知，美滿的家庭，須要有美滿的經濟去維持，若專講婚姻自由，而對於經濟獨立一層，不先解决，這是很大的差誤，倘使家庭而本來富裕的，尙可不生問題，若家庭而並不富有，則青年先當講求生活的能力，與方法，自由當自由得澈底，决不可局部自由，現在大家庭制度，業己根本動摇，本應該經濟獨立，組織小家庭，現在歐美的家庭制度，原是如此。</p>

<p>丨雜感之一丨</p>
<p>「阿要長錠…？」</p>
<p>在黯淡的燈光下，弄堂中傳來這樣一個聲音，恍然記起了今天是廢曆的十五，</p>
<p>從這凄凉的呌喊聲中，使我想起習俗的難移，古老的思想，依舊籠罩着一部份人的心理，與這班生產者的可憐，　　在我們浙江單就紹興一府而論，就有五十多萬人，在從事製造錫箔！長錠的原料！的工作，合全省計之，不下一百多萬人，使用的資本，何止數千萬元，這樣從製箔工人手中，轉到製作長錠的老婆婆手中，來賣給消費者，再由收買箔灰的收去重製，一個毫無意義的生產的循環，就支配了百萬人以上的命運，試檢他們生產的價值，則是消受了現實的人世間的物力！衣食住行等！而對於不可知的冥世盡了些什麽？這是我國生產界中一種極滑稽的現象，結果在浙江省就等於短少了一百萬的人口，而全國四萬七千四百萬人口中，就損失了一百萬人的生產力，這一百萬人的生產力，盡付諸烏有之鄉，我無以名之，名之曰「生命的浪費，」</p>

<p>— 繩武</p>
<p>「先生老闆，做做好事，救救窮人，修子修孫」每到廢歷的初二或十六，自早至暮，總有很多的，男的，女的，老的，幼的，乞丐，大駕光臨而這樣的哀道着，</p>
<p>「給他一個銅元罷，呌他下次不要來」，一個先生模樣的人，對他的一個學徒說，「要他下次不來，這次先不應給他，否則豈不是引狼入室麽」，談話的結果，當然是乞丐吃虧，</p>
<p>起初每逢這天，（初二或十六）有的給，有的不給，打發的結果，没一次到過一百個銅元的，近來似乎比從前多了，我要知道一天究有多少，因於昨日（四月十六）盡量的分給，後來一算，共給掉了銅元一百七十三枚，打破了歷來的紀錄，乞丐漸漸的多起來，治安當然要發生危險，不知負有地方社會治安之責者，其亦一爲思慮否，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Peaceful Discussion on the Postal Workers' Strike <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai postal workers, in an effort to maintain the postal system and consolidate its foundation, have long been brewing a postal rescue movement, which suddenly erupted in a strike yesterday. At the end of last month, they drafted a proposal to the Ministry of Communications, requesting the merging of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau and the cessation of subsidies to airlines. They also called for postal economics to be used solely for postal services, the implementation of special accounting practices, and the preservation of the postal system. This movement is purely for the sake of rescuing the postal service. Their proposals are just and their attitude is extremely forthright. However, their appeals were not approved, which ultimately led to yesterday's strike, causing traffic disruption and burdening the entire society. This is truly a great misfortune.</p>
<p>In past years, China's postal service had surpluses, accumulating over three million yuan. The postal service was on track and its foundation was extremely solid. In recent years, due to the intrusion of bureaucratic politics, the placement of private individuals, the abuse of public funds, and the establishment of redundant agencies, there have been annual deficits, threatening the postal service's very existence. The postal system is becoming increasingly chaotic and its foundation is becoming increasingly shaky. Instead of making efforts to rectify the situation, the authorities are increasing postal rates, further burdening the general public. Therefore, not only are postal workers deeply pained by the situation, but the people of the country have long been complaining.</p>
<p>The separation of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau was never a good idea. Apart from the establishment of a general bureau in Shanghai and a branch bureau in Hankou, the remaining bureaus are all attached to local post offices. Traditionally, local post offices have handled both postal savings and remittance services very well. Therefore, there is no need for separate bureaus in Shanghai and Hankou. If the separation is only for the purpose of accommodating private individuals, the result will be private enrichment at public expense. Therefore, implementing a merger to eliminate corruption, reduce expenses, and unify the postal service is a crucial step in rescuing the postal service. As for the aviation industry, it should certainly be promoted, but it should be supported with separate funding. Post offices should only subsidize the postal delivery portion. Currently, both the China and Eurasia Aviation Companies rely on the postal service for support. Subsidies are endless and deficits are endless. Their weakening of the postal foundation is obvious. Stopping the subsidies and finding separate funding so that the postal service is not burdened is also necessary.</p>
<p>For twenty years, China's politics have been like tangled silk. Only the postal service has been able to stand firm amidst the turbulent situation, unaffected by political turmoil, and has continued to develop. This is because of the postal service's independence. Now, with the intrusion of bureaucratic politics, people come and go, harboring temporary official mindsets, only seeking personal gain, and disregarding the future of the postal service. Therefore, the postal service is deteriorating and its operations are declining. We believe that for the sake of consolidating the postal foundation, the postal service's income and expenses should at least break even as a first step. The second step should be to use surplus profits to expand postal services in the interior, benefiting the common people. Using postal service to support the postal service is a fundamental principle. Today, the postal service in the remote and impoverished areas of China's interior is in urgent need of development. The implementation of special accounting practices and the preservation of the postal system are also crucial tasks that cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>We sympathize with the postal workers' postal rescue movement. However, the strike disrupts traffic, which is a great misfortune. Traffic is the artery of society. If traffic is stopped for a day, society will suffer greatly. Therefore, both sides should engage in open and lengthy discussions to find a proper solution as soon as possible, restore normalcy, consolidate the postal foundation, and benefit society. They must not resort to extremes, which could escalate the situation and make it unmanageable. We hope that the postal service can be improved as soon as possible, and we hope that the postal workers can resume work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Today's Takeover of Zhabei and Zhenru <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning's inspection and arrangement of the takeover of Zhenru</p>
<p>Yesterday's preparatory meeting for the takeover of the fortress</p>
<p>Japanese troops north of the Zhabei Railway have been scheduled to withdraw at 2:00 PM today and will be taken over by our side. The Japanese troops in Zhenru have also been scheduled to withdraw at 11:00 AM this morning and will be taken over by our side. In Zhabei, our side inspected and negotiated on the morning of the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, the takeover committee sent personnel to Zhenru for inspection and negotiation. In the afternoon, the takeover committee held a meeting at the Joint Society, deciding on all matters related to the takeover. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Inspection of Zhenru: Departure of Inspection Personnel <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Zhenru inspection team dispatched by the takeover committee included Liang Fuchu, Tao Xiaojie, and Cha Nanqiang from the takeover committee, Yin Tixin, Shi Jinzhang, Liu Zhenjun, and Wu Qing from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Municipal Councilor Hong Lanxiang, Zhong Shijie from the Municipal Education Bureau, Sun Kaizhi and Zhuge Xun from the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, Jiang Shicheng from the Municipal Public Works Bureau, Yu Ruilin from the Two-Road Bureau, Tao Fengshan from the Shanghai-Hankou Telegraph Line Engineering Office, Zhu Fuyi and Wu Jieyang from the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, Shi Tifen from the China Merchants Public Bus Company, Zhu Shaocheng from the Forensic Medicine Research Institute, and Yang Yufen and Lin Zhiying from Jinan University. They gathered at the Joint Society takeover committee on Xihai Ams Road at 8:00 AM and departed in seven cars at 8:40 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Situations Encountered Along the Way <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>When the cars reached the railway junction of Zhongshan Road, they encountered a Japanese marine corps sentry. Since there was no Japanese escort yesterday, they were stopped and questioned. The cars stopped for about ten minutes. After explanations were given and certificates were shown, they were allowed to pass. Then, they resumed driving along Huhang Road for about a mile and a half, where there was a small wooden bridge erected by the Japanese. Next to it was a wooden sign stating "Erected by the Kanazawa Engineer Battalion." A little further ahead was the Xiaochang Temple, the first sentry post of the Japanese troops in Zhenru. There were two guard posts on both sides of the road, with more than a dozen Japanese soldiers stationed there. The cars were also briefly questioned as they moved forward. Continuing to Zhenru Station, in front of Jinan University, they were again delayed for a quarter of an hour. Tao Xiaojie negotiated with a person resembling a platoon leader at the Japanese sentry post, and they were finally released. At the same time, a Japanese soldier was assigned to accompany the cars, and they went directly to the headquarters of the First Battalion of the Ninth Regiment of the Ninth Division of the Japanese Army. It was already 9:15 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Searching for the Japanese Major <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The barracks of the First Battalion of the Japanese Army are located near Yangjia Bridge, the former site of the 78th Division. The houses are connected on the left and right, totaling three buildings. Originally, they were separated. One building was the dormitory of Jinan University teacher Cao Juren, one was the residence of Jinan University teacher Chen, and the southernmost building was the residence of Lin Weinan, the manager of Guang Sheng Heng. Now, they have been opened up. The Chen building in the middle is now used as the Ninth Division's administrative office, which is the Japanese headquarters. The surroundings are full of trees and blooming flowers. It is indeed a secluded and beautiful place. Inside the building, there are many slogans hanging, as well as a color picture depicting a tomb next to a tree, inscribed "Tomb of the Brave Soldiers," presumably the so-called Tomb of the Three Brave Soldiers. The commanding officer of the First Battalion currently stationed there is Major Inoue Sanichi. When everyone arrived, Inoue happened to be out and had not returned from the inspection. The Japanese side sent someone to look for him. It was not until 10:00 AM that he arrived slowly. Accompanying Inoue was the Japanese translator Kojima Seiichi.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Negotiation Process Between the Two Sides <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>After Inoue arrived, Shi Jinzhang, Yin Tixin, Tao Xiaojie, Liang Fuchu, and Cha Nanqiang from our side negotiated with him. The Japanese officials present included the Japanese translator Kojima and Shen Songge, the so-called chairman of the maintenance association. As a result of the negotiation, the Japanese side decided to withdraw completely at 11:00 AM this morning. Our police officers will arrive at Zhenru Elementary School in the town at 10:00 AM to wait. After the Japanese troops withdraw, they will immediately move in. Inoue then said that the local situation was extremely peaceful, boasting of his military strength. At the same time, he praised Shen Songge, the chairman of the local maintenance association, for maintaining the local area, as if he was promoting Shen. At this point, everyone looked askance at Shen, but Shen not only did not feel ashamed but rather displayed a triumphant expression.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Overview of the Inspection of the Entire Area and the Current Situation of Jinan University <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>After the negotiations were completed, Captain Inoue led the way and departed for the inspection. They first went to Jinan University for a thorough inspection. The large classrooms in the east were still undamaged. The windows and glass had been blown off by Japanese bombs in one corner. Upon entering, the interior was in a state of disarray. Only empty shelves and glass slides remained of the medicine and equipment in each room. The building has three floors, and the situation is roughly the same on each floor. However, the roof of the third floor, in addition to the southwest corner being blown through by a bomb, had four other holes. A bamboo ladder was placed at each hole. It is said that these four holes were dug after the Japanese troops arrived, so that they could be used as lookout platforms. As for the loss of medicines and instruments in the rooms, according to the school staff, most of it occurred around the 15th of this month. The staff member had gone to investigate once before the 15th, and although the items were damaged, only a few were. When he went again on the 20th, everything was gone. To the north of that room is the auditorium, which is still largely undamaged. Next to it is a large open space, which, according to reports, the Japanese army had used as a temporary airfield. There are still many remaining sandbags piled up on both sides of the school gate, which will need to be cleared away in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Power Generation by the Electrical Branch Plant <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Slightly to the west of Jinan University is the Zhenru Electrical Branch Plant. This plant was originally for standby use, so its scope is very small. Because Zhenru's electricity was previously supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, the circuit breakers and motors on the motors of the plant had once been stolen by thieves after the Japanese army occupied it. Later, after extensive investigation, the original items were recovered. However, one circuit breaker is still missing, and the remaining damaged parts are also numerous. Although it can barely generate electricity for use now, according to the staff there, the loss of repairs and replacements in the future will be around three thousand yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Telephone Extension Dismantled <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Zhenru only has ten telephone numbers, so the telephone bureau only set up a ten-number extension within Jinan University. When they went to inspect yesterday, this extension had also been dismantled. Restoring the telephone service will require a separate installation.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Photograph of the Zhenru Town Inspection (Photographed by Xu Tianzhang) <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<h3 id="e11">Inspection of the Overall Situation of the Town <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>At 11:10 AM, they drove to Zhenru Town for inspection. They first went to the Municipal Committee Office, where they briefly inspected and saw the Zhenru Security Regiment stationed inside, with orderly and solemn order. They then went to the Xianghua Bridge Fire Brigade for a look. There was a fire engine, but the tires were gone and the engine parts were missing. Next to it was a truck, which was also tilted and unusable. The captain is Wang Songtao, and there are 22 volunteer members. Then they went to Zhangjia Alley, where there was a Jin pig slaughtering ground, which was bombed on January 20th of the lunar calendar. Only one stove can be used now. Then they went through Zhongshi Bridge. On both sides of the bridge, there were more than a dozen civilian houses, which had all been burned down. Slightly south past Tanjiashan, South Street, South Gate Street, Chuanshin Street, and to Zhenru Elementary School. The school is quite large, with more than 600 students in peacetime. The principal is a local named Wang Deheng. The school buildings are undamaged. Since the school is the temporary location for our police today, they also went to inspect it. On the way back, they went through Dasi Front Street and inspected Dasi for a week. This temple used to be the First Observation Post of the Third Precinct of the Fourth District. The internal office had been burned down. It is said that at the time, a non-fire brigade was located nearby, and now the entire temple has been reduced to ashes. At 11:50 AM, they returned to Zhenru Station. The station building was heavily damaged, and the interior equipment and items had been stolen. There were also some poor people from Jiangbei living inside, which had become a refuge. It will require major repairs before it can be used. At 12:00 PM, the entire inspection was completed, and they all returned to the Joint Society.</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Japanese Army Withdrew and Returned <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army in Zhenru suddenly withdrew on the 19th. On the night before their departure, they had notified Municipal Councilor Hong Lanxiang. Hong had immediately reached an agreement with the Japanese army that the security would be temporarily maintained by 40 members of the city's Security Regiment. Unexpectedly, on the 21st, the Japanese army suddenly sent Lieutenant Nishikawa with 15 soldiers to station themselves in the Yao residence at No. 47 South Main Street in the town. They claimed that they came to maintain security because the Chinese police had not yet arrived. Therefore, during yesterday's inspection, Japanese army soldiers were still standing on the streets of South Main Street. However, it has also been decided that they will withdraw today at the same time as the Japanese troops at Yangjia Bridge.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Final Inspection of the Station <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>At 11:45 AM, they left Zhenru Town and arrived at Zhenru Station. There were still many bombed railway cars parked on the tracks. The platforms and other things were damaged, but repairs were easy. All the items in the office had been stolen, and some poor people from Jiangbei were living inside, which had become a refuge. The stationmaster, Yu Ruilin, ordered the watchmen to order the poor people to move elsewhere immediately. According to Yu, all the items in the office must be replaced, and after the takeover tomorrow, they will separately notify the repairs and notify the Nanxiang Road police to maintain order. At 12:10 PM, the inspection was completed, and they returned along the same route.</p>
<h3 id="e14">The Townspeople Point and Scold the Traitor <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese army invaded Zhenru, Shen Songge of Yangjiazhai was under the command of the Japanese and organized the so-called Zhenru Maintenance Association in Yangjia Bridge. Shen presided over everything and had 65 members. It has been about 40 days since its establishment. Shen is about 40 years old, and once served as a regimental commander under Yue Weijun and as a translator in the former Joint Court. He is quite fluent in Japanese. He now lives in Nanyangzhai, south of Yangjia Bridge. During yesterday's inspection, Shen also accompanied the Japanese Major Inoue and others. He wore a long blue cloth gown, glasses, a thin face, a goatee, and walked slowly with a cane, claiming that he had been effective in maintaining the local area. Inoue also praised Shen for maintaining security. However, the people of Zhenru often pointed and scolded him from afar, saying that Shen privately sold the items left by the 19th Route Army and the items from the residences of the Cantonese and embezzled the donation money.</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Various Aspects of Zhenru Town, A Total of Zhenru District <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>One by one, one square mile and seven, the total number of households in the district is 5,350, but only 700 households in the town, with a total of three security regiments, a total of more than 400 people. A team leader, Zhou Xilian, stationed in Zhenru Town, only 40 people have now been deployed. The second team leader, Gu Jinbao, stationed in Zhujiawan, has a total of more than 100 people, who have all been deployed. There is also an independent platoon with a total of 15 defense posts. Wang Shouyu and Hong Lanxiang manage the security regiment. Since the retreat of our 19th Route Army, the Japanese army stationed in the town is the 9th Regiment of the 9th Division of the Japanese Army, the 1st Battalion of the 9th Regiment, all stationed in Yangjiazhai, the 2nd Battalion Commander, stationed in Sicaige, the 3rd Battalion Department stationed in Zhenru Town. Now there is only the 1st Battalion Headquarters, the total number of people, including the military police, about 300 people, has been scheduled to withdraw today. The people's houses, etc. in Yangjia Bridge are all stationed by the Japanese army, the horse stable is set up in the house, all places are door broken and window destroyed, dirty and unbearable, after the takeover, it will be repaired one by one.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Promulgation of the Takeover Guidelines <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Takeover Committee promulgated six guidelines for the elimination of the burned areas in the takeover area, saying, (1) Proclamation of the Takeover Guidelines for the elimination of the burned areas, and ordering the police organs under its jurisdiction to comply with them, (A) After the takeover of the burned areas, personnel must be immediately dispatched to conduct an on-the-spot inspection, delineate the cleaning area, and within a certain period of time, except for the various public institutions and original residents, after verification and permission, with a permit, all are strictly prohibited from entering, and it is especially necessary to prohibit those who inspect the remaining steel and their property, (B) Residents in the takeover area, many have not moved back, it is feared that there will be impostors pretending to be the owners and taking other people's belongings, so the objects being moved must be strictly inspected to see if they are the original owners, and if it is determined that they are the owners, a permit may be issued as proof, (C) An announcement shall be issued in the takeover area, and anyone who discovers or picks up weapons such as firearms, bullets, and shells shall be limited to reporting or handing them over as soon as possible within five days.

<p>The forts of the Wusong Fortress are all built on sea embankments. When Commander Deng Zhenquan resisted the enemy, the Japanese warships shelled fiercely, so the sea embankments around Fort Taiwan were cracked in thousands of places. The section of the Wusong outer road is also like a honeycomb. It is feared that the autumn tide will surge this year, and there will be a dangerous situation, because the Wusong estuary sea embankment is a major concern for the lives and property of the counties of Shangbao Jiatai.

<p>The Japanese army in Miaohang suddenly withdrew before the 18th. As the other party was not notified in advance, the area was in a state of extreme confusion for a while. Fortunately, the other party learned of this and immediately sent plainclothes police to garrison the area, and the local area gradually recovered. However, on the morning of the 20th, eight Japanese soldiers were suddenly found in the area, coming from the north, carrying horse rifles, firing aimlessly, and at that time, the whole town was once again in a state of extreme panic. Fortunately, the other party's police team was unusually calm and could not take advantage of the situation, so they immediately withdrew. On the morning of the following day (21st), eight more Japanese soldiers came to the town to fire their guns as a show of force. The other party treated them with calm, and the other party's provocation was unsuccessful, so they withdrew again. Afterwards, the authorities there reported the details to the takeover conference and forwarded them to the Japanese side for negotiation.</p>

<p>Three thousand five hundred employees stopped work</p>
<p>Zhong Shigang and Lin Shi came to Shanghai to mediate</p>
<p>Talks with the municipal government failed</p>
<p>Airmail still collected as usual</p>
<p>Shanghai's postal workers went on strike at 5 a.m. yesterday because the Ministry of Transportation did not adopt the plan to consolidate the foundation of the postal service. The General Post Office and its branches in this city were closed and business suspended, and postal delivery was completely stopped. At 3 p.m. yesterday, Mayor Wu Tiecheng invited representatives of the Postal Workers' Union to the municipal government and earnestly advised them to resume work first and wait for a satisfactory resolution. However, the Postal Workers' Union believed that the Ministry of Transportation had not sent a formal representative to negotiate and that there was no sincerity. It was even more out of the question to resume work first. Also, the Ministry of Transportation specially sent Zhong Shigang, the Director of General Affairs, and Lin Shi, the newly appointed Director of Postal Administration, to Shanghai to mediate. At 5:30 p.m. yesterday, they met with Wu Tiecheng. The details are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>The strike committee organized by the Postal Workers' Union ordered all postal workers to go on strike at 5 a.m. yesterday. The General Postal Administration and the 29 district branches were all closed, and none of the more than 3,500 postal workers in the city went to the office. The situation was serious and the order was good. Strike declarations and notices from the workers' unions were posted in front of all post offices. The General Office was plastered with slogans, "Strive to consolidate the postal service", "Oppose the order restricting promotion", "Stop subsidizing airline expenses", and "Maintain the independent postal administration system". All letters, printed matter, packages, money orders, and other postal deliveries were completely stopped. The Postal Administration issued a special notice yesterday stating that the Shanghai Post Office is now in a special situation and the public should pay attention and not put the mail to be sent into the open-air letterboxes on the streets or the mailboxes set up in various places to avoid loss, because these mail items are currently temporarily unavailable for pickup, the special notice said.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 22nd - According to a telegram, Chen Mingshu, the Minister of Transportation, and Chen Fumu, the Vice Minister, paid close attention to the postal workers' strike. Yesterday, they summoned Qian Chunqi, the Director of the Postal Administration, for detailed questioning. Because Qian's answer was ambiguous, he was immediately detained. At the same time, they requested the Executive Yuan to dismiss Long Dafu, the Director of the Postal Administration, and Liu Shufan, the Permanent Supervisor of the Savings and Remittance Bureau.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Transportation detained Qian Chunqi, the Director of the Shanghai General Post Office, and Long Dafu, the Director of the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, in Nanjing yesterday because they had certain suspicions recently. Huang Naiquan has been reassigned as the Director of the Shanghai General Post Office, and Lin Shi has been reassigned as the Director of the Postal Administration of the Ministry of Transportation. It is reported that Huang is a senior figure in the postal industry and has served in the postal service for more than 30 years.</p>

<p>Zhong Shigang, Director of General Affairs of the Ministry of Transportation, and Lin Shi, the newly appointed Director of the Postal Administration, came to Shanghai on the order of the Ministry to mediate the labor unrest. They arrived in Shanghai by plane from Beijing at 3 p.m. yesterday. They met with Yang Jianping, Director of the Postal Remittance Bureau, and visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government at 5:30 p.m. yesterday to discuss how to deal with the labor unrest. In addition, Wu Kaixian, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, and other standing committee members of the Shanghai Special City Party Department went to Beijing by boat the day before yesterday to contact the central government on the issue of the Shanghai postal workers' strike.</p>

Li Yongxiang from the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions attended the meeting. Mayor Wu first explained the pros and cons of the postal workers' strike and earnestly urged them to resume work as soon as possible and then discuss the conditions. He would mediate and dredge as far as he could to satisfy them. The postal workers' representatives said that they first stated the difficulties of the two associations in declaring a strike and expressed their admiration for Mayor Wu's concern for the postal workers. They also said that if the Ministry of Transportation agreed to accept and implement the plan, the employees' wishes would be achieved and the resumption of work would not be a problem. As for the resumption of work first, this matter is of great importance and is beyond the authority of the representatives. They would express their opinions after discussing it with everyone. The talks broke up at 5:10 p.m. without any results.</p>
<h3 id="e36">工會代表談 <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>A representative of the Postal Workers' Unions spoke to reporters, saying that this strike was the result of the Ministry of Transportation's various measures to destroy the postal system for the past three or four years and the accumulated resentment of postal workers. The Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Workers' Union have made sincere suggestions many times, but they have not been accepted, and have even been slandered and rejected. In the past, they were still watching the effect of the measures, but today, even though they were in unbearable pain, the two unions have tolerated it for more than a month and formally suggested to the Ministry of Transportation many times, hoping that the Ministry of Transportation would finally accept it. Unfortunately, the employees exhausted their efforts, but the Ministry of Transportation pretended not to hear. As a result, this strike was unfortunately caused. The facts are obvious, and the Ministry of Transportation cannot shirk its responsibility. Now that the strike has occurred, the two associations hope that the Ministry of Transportation will quickly seek a fundamental solution to consolidate the foundation of the postal service and develop the postal service so that the public anger accumulated by the employees can be completely eliminated. Not only will this incident be easily resolved, but future disputes will also be avoided forever. This is a long-term plan for those who plan for the country, but why are the people in charge of the Ministry of Transportation limited by their prejudices and do not care about the overall situation?</p>

<p>The order of the strike was very good yesterday. However, the patrolmen of the French Concession Police Department arrested several people on the road who distributed leaflets along the way. The leaflets were long and lithographed in blue, without the official seal of the responsible organization. They were printed with slogans such as "Support so-and-so" and "Down with so-and-so". After the strike committee of the association reported it, it stated in a formal letter to the Public Concession and French Concession authorities and the Municipal Public Security Bureau that the leaflets contained fabricated rumors and were obviously intended to sabotage the strike. The association solemnly stated that it had never sent anyone to distribute leaflets outside and requested a thorough investigation to maintain order.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs, The Shanghai postal workers' strike led by our association this time comes from the heart of consolidating the postal service. Today's postal service is ruined due to the division and destruction of the postal system and its organization. Therefore, the current action of the factory association is to maintain the original good organization and system of the postal service. It has nothing to do with any politics, and it is not an act of destroying the postal service. For this reason, if our association and its members do not engage in activities that disturb public order, your bureau should not interfere. Strikes are the most common means used by social organizations in European and American countries today, and there is no crime involved. Moreover, our association has a very complete organization during this strike period and has a picket team to maintain order to prevent various disputes that may affect public order. However, it must be stated that our association has never sent anyone to distribute leaflets, give public speeches, or make political attempts in the streets. If such a situation occurs, it must be a criminal who is swaggering. Your bureau can arrest and prosecute them according to the law. In order to recognize that your bureau has misunderstandings about our association's actions this time, we hereby send this letter to you for your information and handling. We also extend our public friendship to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Public Concession Bureau, and the French Concession Bureau, from the Strike Committee of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Shanghai Postal Employees' Union, May 22, Republic of China.</p>

<p>The Postal Workers' Unions issued a letter to the members of the two unions yesterday, saying, "Members of the two unions, this time the Shanghai postal workers, because they feel that the Chinese postal service is in the most critical and dilapidated state, are forced to take the final action. Not only does the national society express extreme sympathy, but also the Ministry of Transportation feels that there is no word to escape. It can be seen that our strike this time is extremely appropriate. At the same time, our reasons for the postal protection movement are extremely clear and sufficient. Therefore, anyone who uses all despicable and inferior means in an attempt to sabotage our strike this time is simply exposing his ugliness. The unity of all postal workers in Shanghai will be extraordinarily strong because of this. In the afternoon of the strike yesterday, the presidium sent representatives to answer the call of Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and had a talk. As a result of the talk, our demands were temporarily unresolved. We admire Mayor Wu's spirit of mediation very much. However, we believe that Mayor Wu still does not understand us, and we feel very sorry. But in order to consolidate the foundation of the postal service and save the postal service from danger, if our demands this time cannot be thoroughly resolved, our strike will continue. And when necessary, the postal workers of the whole country will have a general outbreak, and they will fight with the power of the whole country to achieve our goals, because the postal service is at a time of life and death and needs our salvation. All members, the history of postal workers in the past is a history of complete glory, and this time we want to create a more glorious page. As long as we align our ranks, with the courage of perseverance, fight for the survival of the postal service, the final victory is shining in front of us. We will play the triumphant song of Long Live the Postal Service." Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Shanghai Postal Employees' Union, Strike Committee, May 22, Republic of China.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. Wang Jingwei of Nanjing, Our associations were forced to strike this time because the Ministry of Transportation rejected our proposal to consolidate the foundation of the postal service. In fact, it was out of our love for the postal service and our loyalty. It can be witnessed by heaven and earth. It is neither any political action nor any factional background. If our demands can be met, it will be a great blessing for the future of the postal service. However, since the incident, some people have speculated, doubted, insulted, and slandered us. Recently, they have provoked discord, launched attacks, and tried to sabotage us with painstaking efforts. Our associations are extremely saddened by this. Now, we sincerely tell you, sir, that our associations have pure aspirations and put the postal service first in everything. We do not care about anything else. If anyone thinks that we are instigated by others to do this, then let us be punished by the people of the world. On the other hand, those who use despicable means to insult the pure postal workers' movement will be abandoned by the people of the world. Therefore, we have expressed our innermost thoughts and feelings and painfully stated our concerns. We hope that you, sir, will be wise and enlighten us. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Shanghai Postal Employees' Union respectfully bow.</p>

<p>Today, the postal workers in this city are on strike. Reporters specially visited Mayor Wu to inquire about the handling measures. Mayor Wu told us that after I (Wu) met with representatives of the two postal workers' associations yesterday afternoon, I agreed to invite Director Xie Jinjian sent by the Ministry of Transportation and Comrades Wu Zhongheng and Zhang Jiafan, section chiefs of the Mass Training Committee of the Central Party Department, to a meeting at the Municipal Government at 3 p.m. today to earnestly persuade them. I never expected that the two associations, for some reason, would be impatient and suddenly go on strike at 5 a.m. this morning. The Ministry of Transportation is not unwilling to accept the employees' demands for treatment, but the issues of the merger of the Savings and Remittance Bureau and the cancellation of airline subsidies are related to national laws, regulations, and administrative systems and cannot be changed at will. Even the consolidation of the postal service is a matter for the government, and the employees should not overstep their authority, let alone use strikes as a threat. At a time when the country is in trouble and the order after the war in Shanghai needs to be restored urgently, and the people's suffering needs to be relieved urgently, the sudden postal strike is deeply affecting the local public order. I am afraid that the result of the strike is not to consolidate the postal service, which is not what the employees of the two associations expected. Today, when I met with the representatives of the employees Zhang Zhichang, Fu Dewei, Qi Jiamou, etc. at the Municipal Government, I earnestly persuaded them and told them that since they are already on strike, they should resume work quickly and wait for a solution, so that the impact on the future of the postal service and local public order will not be too great. As for the postal workers who resume work, I have discussed it with the concession authorities and ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to protect them with all their strength.</p>

<p>Although the postal workers are on strike this time, China National Aviation Corporation will still collect, send, and deliver airmail to Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, and other ports as usual. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will also be open as usual. All savings accounts in various savings and remittance branches in this city can also deposit and withdraw funds at the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau at No. 4 Fuzhou Road. In addition, the employees of the Remittance Bureau, who were originally personnel of the Postal Bureau, joined the strike yesterday according to the order of the Postal Workers' Union and Postal Employees' Union, totaling about 60 people.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Transportation refuted the reasons for the Shanghai Postal Workers' Unions' proposal to consolidate the foundation of the postal service, regarding the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, as follows: (1) Regarding the issue of the Savings and Remittance Bureau employing non-postal employees, the reason is very clear. Postal knowledge is certainly not something that ordinary people can understand, and financial investment issues are also not something that postal employees can master. From the perspective of savings, it is not just about collecting and paying savings, but its interest rate changes, the benefits and drawbacks of its use, and the trends of the market economy and commercial economy are closely related. The remittance business is also not just about allocating remittances. If the consideration of the exchange rate is high or low and the allocation of funds are not familiar with commercial conditions, it will not be effective. Moreover, foreign exchange remittances require in-depth research and knowledge of world finance to assess the gains and losses and plan ahead. The establishment of an agency specializing in savings and remittances and the selection of specialized personnel is precisely for this reason. Except for the General Bureau and the Jinghu and Huangpu branches, which have to use specialized personnel, ordinary business is still handled by various post offices. As for the union's statement that savings and remittances will all be managed by people who have nothing to do with the postal service, while still using the word "postal service" and calling it the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the postal service and its personnel will bear the responsibility, which is not fair, it shows the union's deep prejudice. The postal service is a pronoun for a kind of business and cannot be monopolized by a small number of people. The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau handles postal savings and remittance affairs, so why can't it use the word "postal service"? It is difficult to understand. In other words, the employees of the Postal General Bureau can be called postal employees, and the personnel of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are also doing part of the postal affairs for the country. In the eyes of the government, they are also postal employees. Why should we arbitrarily divide the boundaries? As for the transfer of personnel with politics, it is really unclear. The task of the senior officials of the agency is to plan the business and determine the direction. Although the senior personnel may change slightly, there may be different reform directions for the plan, but the executors are mostly old people, which does not hinder the business. The more frequent the turnover, the more mixed the responsibility is, which is even more a conjecture. The turnover has procedures and account books, and the responsibility is clear. Why is it more mixed? Postal employees are also not people who are not transferred for a long time. The handover is clear, and it is not seen that the responsibility is more mixed. (2) It is a misunderstanding that the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau is gradually sending postal personnel back to the post office. This time, the Savings and Remittance Bureau transferred the two deputy directors of the insurance savings to the postal service. The General Bureau appointed them because the position of deputy director was completely abolished, not to reduce postal personnel. Now, there are a large number of postal personnel serving in the Savings and Remittance Bureau, so the saying that they are gradually being sent back is unknown. Moreover, ordinary business is still handled by local post offices, and the international misunderstanding is unknown. (3) The Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau abolished the deputy director and merged the director this time, which is nothing more than reducing expenses during the national crisis, not because the affairs are simple and personnel are needed. The personnel of this bureau have a spirit of hard work and sacrifice. They use fewer people and do more things. If it is said that merging with the Postal General Bureau is more economical, the meaning of setting up a separate bureau should be clarified first. I will not repeat it here. As for the fact that Japanese savings have reached 300 million yuan, and the affairs have become more complicated, so there is a separation, and my country's savings are less than 30 million yuan, so there is no need for separation, it should be known that my country's postal savings were not developed under the management of the Postal General Bureau. Therefore, it is necessary to set up a special management agency to vigorously promote it. This kind of misunderstanding of the union is just like when the post office was first established, some people pointed out that the affairs of the letter bureau have not yet been developed, so there is no need to establish a post office. It should also be stated that whether it is the Postal Bureau or the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, they are both doing things for the country and seeking welfare for the people. The Savings and Remittance Bureau is also handling part of the postal affairs, so there is no talk of using the credit of the Postal Bureau. (4) The situation in each country is different, and studying and comparing the established rules of other countries to learn from them is an essential element for the progress of the business. However, if you do not know the needs of your own country and only know how to copy the established methods of other countries, then it is worthless. The Japanese Savings and Remittance Bureau does not also operate banking business, and most of the savings are invested in securities and government bonds, so there is no need to set up branches, so it is incomprehensible to call it an absolute redundancy agency. (5) Regarding the postal personnel who also handle savings and remittances, their rewards, punishments, and promotions are still handled according to the old rules of the Postal Bureau. The Savings and Remittance Bureau only participates in the opinions and is still executed by the Postal General Bureau. The reason for this is that although they are still under the jurisdiction of the Postal General Bureau, they also handle savings business, so the Savings and Remittance Bureau has to manage them. As for the officials of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, they are completely under the jurisdiction of the Savings and Remittance Bureau, and the Postal General Bureau does not need to interfere. As for the fact that the Postal General Bureau cannot manage all the funds of the postal service, there is no basis for this. The so-called overdraft is that the Postal General Bureau is temporarily unable to turn around and has to transfer and use it from the Savings and Remittance Bureau. Any financial institution has this method, so what is strange? In short, the establishment of the Savings and Remittance Bureau has not only not wasted postal funds, but has actually gained a lot of benefits for the postal service. All the net profits of the Savings and Remittance Bureau have also been completely allocated to the Postal General Bureau for use. The facts are all there, and there is no need to refute them.</p>

<p>At 10 a.m. yesterday, Zha Peilin, Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, Yu Xianglin, Director of General Affairs of the Postal General Bureau, Smith, Director of the Planning Office, Zhang Rongchang, Postal Director, and directors of various departments, etc., held an emergency meeting in the Director's Office on the third floor of the Postal General Bureau on Sichuan Road, and were extremely anxious about the strike. They also researched the causes of the strike, but the results were not released. Also, after the Postal Workers' Unions posted a strike notice outside the bureau gate at 0:30 this morning, Zha Peilin, Director of the Postal Administration, immediately ordered Tang Jisheng, the police officer stationed at the post office by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, and police chiefs Wang Yantang and Xu Yimin to lead 18 police officers to guard various departments in the bureau to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3 id="e45">THIRD PARTY OPINIONS <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(1) (Shanghai Various Groups National Salvation United Association) Yesterday telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan Ministry of Transportation, the message said, "To the respected Nanjing Executive Yuan Ministry of Transportation: We received reports from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Staff Union stating that the postal service has been suffering losses in recent years due to improper personnel administration by previous authorities. To consolidate the postal foundation, the postal workers have made specific requests such as postal economic independence and postal employee protection. This association has carefully examined these requests and believes that each request aims to reduce the burden on the postal service, whether by changing laws or reforming government orders. They do not have malicious intentions towards individuals or selfish motives. Moreover, protecting technical and administrative personnel is the highest principle for consolidating any enterprise. The government should weigh the importance of these requests and consider public opinion to improve the current state of the postal service. However, it has now evolved into an unfortunate strike, causing inconvenience to the public. During this time of national crisis, all internal and external publicity efforts have been completely halted, which is especially regrettable. Therefore, we specifically telegraph your esteemed Yuan (Ministry) to accommodate the various requests of the postal workers as much as possible within the realm of possibility, so as to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, which would be our greatest wish. The Shanghai Various Groups National Salvation United Association respectfully kowtows."</p>
<p>(2) (Public Organizations United Association) The Public Organizations United Association of this city expresses deep sympathy for the postal workers' strike and has specially sent representatives to express their condolences. The original text is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, we have found that the postal service concerns the interests of the entire nation and is by no means comparable to other administrative matters. This time, the Ministry of Transportation, catering to the authorities, rashly increased postal rates, which has not only opened the door to arbitrary allocation, but also portends a disaster that could collapse the foundation. The report stated that your association's plan to consolidate the postal foundation is the most legitimate method. However, it was not approved and was dismissed without regard, resulting in your association's action to strike and save the postal service, and your spirit of struggle cannot but be admired. Our association has now sent representatives Zhang Hesheng and Song An to express our condolences. Your association's love for the country and the postal service, and all your efforts, can be said to be a testament to justice residing in the hearts of the people. We urge you to persevere in your advocacy and carry it through to the end. Our association will lead representatives from all affiliated organizations and the entire citizenry to do our utmost to provide support. We respectfully submit this message and hope for your consideration. (Below omitted) The Shanghai Various Public Organizations United Association."</p>
<p>(3) (Telecom Workers' Unions of Fujian, Hebei, Jiangsu, etc.) Yesterday, a declaration was issued regarding the postal workers' strike in this city, stating: "In recent years, the nation has suffered many misfortunes, society is in turmoil, and all industries are declining. State-run transportation enterprises have been deeply affected by the turbulence of political tides. The telecom administration is as fragile as eggs stacked together, and the shipping administration is on the verge of bankruptcy. The only one that can transcend political tides and whose business is still progressing is the postal service, which has a complete system and independent administration. However, since the recovery of postal rights, it has not revitalized itself and its measures have been inappropriate. First, it increased the number of remittance bureaus, shaking the postal foundation. Then, it spent money on aviation subsidies, wasting postal funds. Finally, it increased postal rates, burdening our people. If this continues, the postal service that we have painstakingly built will also fall into an irreparable state like the telecom and shipping administrations, which is very painful. Now, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Staff Union, with their sincere dedication to protecting the postal service, have contributed a plan to consolidate the postal foundation, offering advice and insights, identifying the root causes of the problems, and running around and shouting until their voices are hoarse. What they have proposed, such as merging the postal and remittance bureaus, stopping aviation subsidies, maintaining the postal system, and independent accounting to use postal funds to support the postal service, cannot but be aimed at consolidating the national transportation enterprises. This can certainly win the deep sympathy of all sectors of society. In the eyes of our telecom workers, we cannot help but feel a sense of shared hardship. Our country's telecom industry has been subjected to the incompetence of bureaucratic politics on one hand and the influence of a bad system on the other for more than fifty years, resulting in a fragmented situation, and now it has reached the brink of survival. Unexpectedly, the postal service, which has been beyond the turbulence of political tides for more than thirty years, has not been ruined during the days when foreign ministers were in power, but has been shaken after the recovery of postal rights. Our association and others are deeply saddened by the imminent collapse of the telecom administration and are striving to struggle. We cannot bear to see the postal service become a sequel to the telecom administration. Now, the Ministry of Transportation has not adopted the suggestions of the postal workers, which has led to the realization of the most unfortunate postal strike. Postal and telecom workers stand on the same ground and should do their best to provide active assistance. We also hope that all compatriots across the country will recognize that the rise and fall of transportation enterprises are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and will unanimously support and urge the authorities to adopt the suggestions quickly, so as to prevent the storm from expanding and becoming more difficult to control. Transportation is fortunate, and the country is fortunate. This declaration is hereby made. The Telecom Workers' Unions of Fujian, Hebei, Jiangsu, etc."</p>
<p>(4) The Shanghai Seamen's Union and others declared: "The news of the postal workers' strike has been published in yesterday's newspaper. We have now learned that the various public organizations in Shanghai have issued a declaration regarding the strike. The original text is recorded as follows: 'The Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Staff Union oppose the increase in postal rates due to the depletion of the social economy, which is something that the public fully supports. However, the government, mindful of the people's hardship, has adopted a compromise. As for the restoration of rice subsidies, it has been fully adopted. Yet, the Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Staff Union have repeatedly blackmailed the government. The blackmail conditions are no longer within the scope of economics. Moreover, for a national transportation agency to resort to drastic measures during a time of national crisis seems too hasty. The only purpose of our union is to sympathize with the workers' own interests and absolutely support the government. We do not participate in politics in any way. If anyone uses our name to publish notices in the newspaper, we will not recognize them. In addition to the announcements we have already published, this declaration is hereby made. The Shanghai Seamen's Union, the Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union, the Eighth District Cotton Textile Industry Union, the Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, the Shanghai Dock Workers' Union, the Fifth District Carpentry Industry Union, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Union, the Hudong District Yarn Factory Union Federation, the Shanghai Publishing Industry Union, the Fifth District Paper Manufacturing Industry Union, the Third District Silk Reeling Industry Union, the Sixth District Cigarette Industry Union, the Shanghai Wood Transport Union, the Fifth District Loading and Unloading Industry Union, the Fifth District Cotton Yarn Industry Union, the Newspaper Delivery Union, the Umbrella Industry Union, the Mercerizing and Dyeing Industry Union, the Sixth District Silk Reeling Industry Union, the Ink Making Union, the Steamboat Carpentry Union, the Fourth District Transportation Union, the First District Cleaning Industry Union.'"</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Salvation Associations yesterday sent a letter to the Nanjing Censorate, saying, "To the Esteemed President Gao and Committee Members of the Nanjing Censorate: We are deeply moved by your esteemed Censorate's unforgotten duty and your concern for the National Government's organizational bill, as well as your presentation of an impeachment case against Wang Jingwei for violating and signing the Shanghai Truce Agreement. This Association already issued a declaration on the 7th of this month, notifying both domestic and foreign parties and declaring its denial of this agreement. Now that your esteemed Censorate has initiated an impeachment, it is even clearer that the agreement has no legal basis and cannot take effect. Fortunately, it is not as if there is no one left to speak out, and the people's hearts are not entirely dead. Our Yellow Emperor ancestor will not be disappointed.

<h3 id="e47">THE JAPANESE TRANSPORT SHIP GUANGFU MARU CAUGHT FIRE YESTERDAY <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>All the gasoline inside the ship was destroyed</p>
<p>The fire spread rapidly</p>
<p>The Japanese army and navy have been withdrawing successively in recent days. The Japanese Ministry of the Army specially dispatched several military transport ships to Shanghai to transport troops. The ships "Yemaru" and "Guanganmaru," among others, were used. Yesterday, the Japanese 9th Division's Akazawa Brigade, the Military Police Corps, and a large amount of ammunition were withdrawn from Shanghai and transported by the transport ship "Haianmaru," escorted by a torpedo boat of the 26th Japanese Naval Unit. There was also a Japanese transport ship named "Guangfumaru," carrying a large amount of airplane gasoline and other items, anchored on the Jiangmian River surface near the Lantian Factory pier in the eastern section of Yangshupu. Yesterday afternoon, the ship suddenly caught fire. Because the cabin was full of gasoline, which is highly flammable, the fire spread rapidly once ignited. In an instant, the fire became fierce and unapproachable. Although the personnel on board tried their best to extinguish the fire with specially prepared fire extinguishing chemicals, they were ineffective due to the excessive flames. The ship owners and others sent a telegram seeking help. The Japanese navy warships rushed to help after hearing the news. The Fire Brigade was notified and immediately dispatched a small boat carrying a fire engine to put out the fire. Until 6:00 p.m., the fire was not completely extinguished, but it had been slightly suppressed. Most of the military gasoline and other items carried on the ship were lost, and the ship's hull was also damaged. The Japanese military authorities are investigating.</p>

<p>Shaped like dancing ribbons, colored silver-gray</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign men and women looked up in amazement</p>
<p>The weather was clear yesterday. At 6:45 p.m., a white cloud suddenly appeared in the sky, winding like a stage ribbon, shining brightly in a silver-gray color. At the time, the sun had already set, but the light had not yet disappeared. The sky was a sheet of blue, with no clouds at all. Chinese and foreign men and women in the streets stopped and looked up in amazement, calling it a white dragon. Yesterday evening, when the sun set, strange colored white clouds suddenly appeared in the sky. Villagers in Baoshan Yuepu and other places mistakenly thought it was a lunar eclipse and followed the old custom of setting off firecrackers. For a time, the sound of firecrackers was loud. The Japanese army stationed in Yanghang was greatly alarmed when they heard the sound and immediately dug trenches, tightened security, and deployed defenses. The situation was very serious. Later, they realized it was a misunderstanding and restored the original state.</p>

<p>Appealing to domestic philanthropists for urgent relief</p>
<p>Organizing work relief to develop the Northwest</p>
<p>Zhang Lianquan, representative of the 17th Route Army of the Northwest and special commissioner of the Northwest People's Livelihood Development Company, came south to Shanghai last time and urged Li Rongbin to be the chief designer, stationed in Shanghai to negotiate everything. He also hired four specialized technicians to assist in transportation, mining, planting, rural and other matters. While in Shanghai, Mr. Zhang had many discussions with Hu Shuhua, Guo Zifan, and others, and expressed his extreme welcome to the Northwest Research Group organized by Hu and Guo. After Mr. Zhang finished his affairs in Shanghai, he rushed back to the Northwest. Yesterday, a telegram came to Shanghai, addressed to Li Rongbin, who was staying in Shanghai, detailing the welcome of the Northwest authorities for the research group and describing the severe disaster situation in the Northwest. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e51">WELCOME TO THE RESEARCH GROUP <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Hu Shuhua, Guo Zifan, and others have always attached great importance to the Northwest issue, believing that it is necessary for Chinese people to investigate and develop it. Therefore, they established the Northwest Research Association and organized an investigation team in Shanghai to conduct on-site inspections by subject. Last time, Zhang Lianquan met with Hu and Guo several times in Shanghai to discuss the investigation procedures. Both sides were very satisfied. Now that Zhang has returned to Xi'an, he has discussed and decided with Yang Hucheng and other authorities in Shaanxi and Gansu. According to the telegram yesterday, the leaders of Shaanxi and Gansu have always been very concerned about the people's livelihood. Due to the great tribulations and multiple difficulties, and the lack of economic strength, they have not been able to fully develop it. Now that Japanese pirates are invading the Northeast and enterprises in Shanghai and Tianjin are being destroyed, it is the only way out for the intellectual class and those with a little capital to rise up and develop the Northwest. In addition to organizing institutions to promote it, they also welcome entrepreneurs to operate in the Northwest. They also welcome the Northwest Research Association led by Hu and Guo to conduct on-site investigations in the Northwest and are willing to do their best to protect them and provide them with practical assistance. This telegram has been forwarded to Hu and Guo by Mr. Li.</p>
<h3 id="e52">THE SEVERITY OF THE DROUGHT DISASTER <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Zhang also telegraphed that since last year, there has been very little rain in Shaanxi and Gansu. After entering winter, black frost suddenly fell. The drought is even more severe this year. The cotton and wheat planted by the farmers have all withered and died. There is a shortage of food, and disaster victims are everywhere. The problem of people's food has already caused a great panic. Now, every hundred catties of flour has risen to more than fifteen yuan, and every dou of wheat has risen to three yuan and five jiao, and there is a continued rapid increase. The disaster area is gradually expanding, and the number of disaster victims is increasing day by day. The people are clamoring for food. The disaster area is gradually expanding, and all the wheat is dried and dead. Autumn seedlings cannot be sown, and the land has also lost its effectiveness. Director Yang Hucheng has telegraphed the capital to ask for relief and, on the one hand, to appease the people and discuss relief methods. It will not be effective without widely asking for relief.</p>
<h3 id="e53">APPEAL TO CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang's telegram also described the severity of the disaster and the misery of the people's displacement, and stated that if emergency relief is not provided, the good people who have been affected by the disaster will be forced to become bandits, and red panic may inevitably spread to the Northwest. Shanghai is not lacking in charitable magnates, who feel the pain in their hearts and are willing to offer assistance. He earnestly requested Mr. Li Rongbin and Mr. Hu Shuhua to discuss and launch emergency relief. However, no matter what charitable organization it is, it is best to go directly to provide relief. Relief funds and relief goods do not have to go through any agency, so that relief can be provided one day earlier, and more disaster victims can live. If it is possible to use the development of the Northwest industry and work relief, thereby using the dying cheap labor force to build projects, build roads, and exploit minerals, etc., then disaster relief and the revitalization of industry will be accomplished, and one move will have multiple benefits.</p>

<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association has been handling matters related to assisting the Northeast Volunteer Army, and has received the faith and support of the entire public. Yesterday, the Shen Bao office forwarded 55 yuan and 5 jiao donated by the colleagues of the Kaogong Department of Dasheng No. 3 Textile Factory, receipt No. 4, and a letter. The original letter stated that the violent Japanese have been wreaking havoc and invading our country, and their primary purpose has been achieved. They are about to sweep across all of our territory. Our government, which offers no resistance, has become extremely unreliable. Fortunately, hundreds of thousands of brave men in the Northeast have risen up in arms, slightly blunting their advance. My colleagues are deeply aware of the great righteousness of responsibility for survival and do not want to die for the country together, but should also contribute as much as we can. How can we bear to see the beautiful rivers and mountains fall into foreign hands? Your association is organized to deal with the great disaster, and all the gentlemen in charge are admired by all. We have exhausted our meager resources and donated 55 yuan and 5 jiao, asking for a receipt and hoping for wide publicity to awaken compatriots across the country to rise up together and assist.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the Association for the Support of the Families of Fallen Soldiers Who Defended the Country has held many meetings regarding the issue of supporting the families of fallen soldiers in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War and has formulated specific measures. However, various undertakings must be carried out in order, and a considerable fund is required to maintain them permanently. The association is now working on fundraising methods, first asking the various committee members to distribute donation registers and solicit donations, and then asking the various public groups to assist, so that everyone can work together to make contributions. It is heard that the various committee members have already sent donation registers separately to solicit donations widely.</p>

<p>Zhang Changyu's life is in danger</p>
<p>There is a fishing boat moored in the Yangjingzhen River opposite the Dagong Yarn Factory in Yangshupu. The boatman is an old couple from Jiangbei, named Zhang Changyu, 50 years old, and his wife, Zhou, 42 years old, who depend on each other for life. Last night at 11:30, they were awakened from their sleep by the noise in the area and went ashore together to investigate. Unexpectedly, there was a Japanese army camp stationed across the shore, and they were seen by the Japanese army sentries, who opened fire many times. One bullet hit Zhang in the throat, and the bullet pierced through. His breath was barely continuing. Another bullet hit Zhou's left breast. Later, neighbors who heard the news arrived and sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, Zhang's life is in danger due to his age and weak blood. The hospital then notified the Fourth Horse Road Police Station, which ordered two Western detectives to go to the hospital to investigate and report to the police chief for handling.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society has determined that the Jiading area has been ravaged by the Japanese army this time, and the disaster situation is extremely serious. After the Japanese army withdrew, the refugees gradually returned, but nine out of ten houses were empty. The two wheats have not been harvested, and there is nothing to eat. Therefore, Gu, Chai, and Chen were sent to carry 1,000 bags of relief rice and 4,000 yuan of relief money to Jiading for emergency distribution. It is estimated that 300 bags of rice will be distributed inside and outside Jiading city, 200 bags in Nanxiang, 250 bags in Loutang, 150 bags in Waigang, and 100 bags in Fangtai Huangdu. The relief money will be allocated appropriately. Each member will conduct on-site investigations with the local district chiefs and village chiefs, select the most impoverished, and give them foreign rice separately. Also, the houses of the villagers in various places have been either bombed or burned, leaving them homeless, which is especially tragic. Therefore, in the northeast and two townships of Jiading and the Loutang area, those who are the most helpless will be lent funds to build thatched houses, so that they can temporarily have a place to live. A total of 4,000 yuan has been issued. The above two matters are now nearing completion. However, after inspecting the disaster area, the disaster situation is extremely serious, and the association has a sense of using a cup of water to put out a fire.

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Chinese Southeast Main Association of the World Red Swastika Society has established several shelters and hospitals and organized nine relief teams to handle Shanghai war relief this time. After three months, it has rescued 50,000 to 60,000 refugees and wounded soldiers. Now that the various relief undertakings have come to an end, a commendation meeting was specially convened for all service personnel at the Shandong Guild Hall at the intersection of Luban Road and Ximen Road yesterday (the 22nd) at 2:00 p.m. More than 500 people attended. Chairman Chen Zishi delivered a commendation speech, roughly stating that the association's handling of the Shanghai war relief this time was rushed, and he was grateful for the full assistance given by all sectors of society in terms of material and spirit, and he was also grateful for the temporary addition of various doctors and ladies, who carried out the matter from beginning to end.

<h3 id="e60">NEW SOCIETY PROTESTS AGAINST THE DETENTION OF ITS BI-MONTHLY MAGAZINE IN SHANDONG PROVINCE <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The New Society bi-monthly magazine, published at 150 Weihaiwei Road and sold by the Kaiming and Modern Bookstores, is a valuable magazine among domestic periodicals. The recently published "International Situation and Soviet Russia Observation Issue" is especially welcomed by those who are concerned about the world situation. Unexpectedly, it was detained by the Shandong postal inspector. After the company received notification from the post office, it protested to the Shandong provincial authorities. The letter to Han Fuju stated, "We recently received Public Letter No. 1335 from the Shanghai Postal Administration, informing us that the New Society bi-monthly magazine sent by our company to the Shandong Bookstore in Jinan for sale was inspected and detained by your postal inspector, which is extremely surprising. When the New Society bi-monthly magazine published by our company was founded, it was approved and registered by the Shanghai Municipal Government. Its purpose is pure, and its arguments are fair. The writers are all professors from universities and well-known figures in Shanghai. It has been almost a year since its founding and has always been loved by people at home and abroad. Many service personnel in the military and political circles have also subscribed to it. It is clear that it is not a prohibited publication. Now it has suddenly been detained by your postal inspector, which is deeply regrettable. We are now sending you two copies each of the 9th and 10th issues of the New Society bi-monthly magazine and earnestly requesting you to read them and designate personnel to review them. If there is no violation of local prohibitions, we beg you to order the postal inspector to deliver the detained books to the Shandong Bookstore for sale and to give them appropriate promotion." It is expected that Chairman Han will be able to grant the request.</p>
<h3 id="e61">THE MUNICIPAL POLICE BUREAU CRACKS DOWN ON A LARGE BATCH OF MILITARY WEAPONS <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Various firearms and bullets were seized</p>
<p>More than a dozen criminals have been arrested</p>
<p>Lu Ying, the captain of the Detective Team of the Municipal Police Bureau, received a secret report from detectives Wu Kezhong, Zhao Huairen, and Chen Caifu that arms dealers Zhang Zaixiang, Liu Zihan, and others were hiding in the Nanshi area and had set up more than four organizations. After receiving the report, Captain Lu dispatched detectives Dan Bin, Cui Youkuan, and Liu Xiangyun, along with secret agents Yang Qing and You Hanwen, at 8:00 p.m. on the 21st, to join forces with the police officers of the Second District to the 59th lane of Zhenxinmingli in the Shanghai Army Camp, No. 5 Yangchang Lane outside Dananmen, No. 2, 29 Lane, Fushan Tang Street and No. 150, Lixian Gua Street and other places. More than ten male and female criminals, including Zhang Zaixiang, were arrested, and twelve rifles, one submachine gun, three large boxes of bullets, four bullet belts, four empty wooden shells, and about 3,650 scattered bullets, as well as many parts for the guns, were seized and taken away for strict interrogation and investigation. After hearing the news, Zhang Dongkai, the district chief of the Second District of the Bureau, dispatched Liu Xueli, the patrol chief of the Chenjiaqiao Police Station, and police officer Sun Changrong to Xinmingli, Miaojiang Road, at 11:00 p.m. on the same day. Li Guangqin, the account room manager, led them to an empty house at No. 27, where six large and small wooden boxes were found. Inside, there was one Jinling-made small submachine gun, one Shanghai-made submachine gun body, five bolt-action rifles, five Hanyang-made rifles, two Guangdong-made rifles, one Type 38 rifle, seven bolt-action iron sleeves, twelve bullet slots, twenty-six submachine gun barrels, two rifles, three boxes of rifle bullets, about 5,000 rounds, and a package of rifle parts. District Chief Zhang believed that the matter concerned the private storage of military weapons and immediately submitted the evidence to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for review.</p>
<h3 id="e62">HONGXING COMPANY SUES DOU YANONG FOR NON-PAYMENT OF RENT <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Mediation breaks down, rehearing scheduled</p>
<p>Dou Yanong from Shandong is a current military officer who participated in the Sino-Japanese Songhu Battle. His family lives in the middle section of Ningbo Road. Recently, due to the fact that all citizens were affected by the war, a movement to reduce and exempt rent was launched. A Rent Reduction and Exemption Movement Committee was organized, and it was resolved that all places north of the Suzhou River should be exempt from rent for three months, and all places south of the Suzhou River should be exempt for two months. The house where Dou lived was the property of the Hongxing Company. The rent from November of last year to April of this year has not been paid. The owner asked him to pay, and Dou told him that the rent for November and December was old debt and should be paid. The rent for January and April should also be repaid in installments. However, the Rent Reduction Committee has already resolved to exempt the rent for February and March, and has submitted it to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. Before the approval is received, it would be different from everyone else to pay first, and to destroy unity. The rent for these two months is difficult to pay at this time. The owner then extended the lawsuit to the First Special District Local Court through lawyers Yan and Sen. Judge Lou held a court session and persuaded both parties to resolve the matter peacefully out of court. However, although the host and guests contacted each other repeatedly, they did not reach an agreement. Yesterday, Judge Lou continued the hearing and advised both parties to resolve the matter peacefully in court. He ordered the defendant to pay the rent for November and December, and the rent for January and April to be returned in four months, namely June, July, October and November. Dou also obeyed. As for the remaining two months of February and March, Dou intended to wait for the Social Affairs Bureau to resolve the rent reduction issue and then settle the account. The plaintiff argued that it should also be repaid in installments. If the Social Affairs Bureau approves the rent exemption for the two months in the future, the plaintiff can return it. However, Dou strongly opposed this argument. Although Judge Lou earnestly advised, neither party showed any concession, and the mediation broke down again. Therefore, it was ordered to reschedule the hearing for further review.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Feng Sulan accuses Cao Zhimei of seduction and abandonment <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Demanding 20,000 yuan for damages and living expenses</p>
<p>Feng Sulan, a local woman also known as Meidi, is twenty years old, quite attractive, and lives at No. 128 Feihong Road. She formerly studied at Yangzheng Girls' School in the city and was of excellent character and academics. Recently, she engaged lawyer Tang Huaiqun to file a complaint with the First Special District Court against Cao Zhimei, residing at No. 47 Tongzhou Road, for seduction, intimidation, and abandonment. The afternoon before yesterday, Judge Wu Tingqi presided over a joint hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant, Cao Zhimei, failed to appear despite being summoned. According to the plaintiff's representative, lawyer Tang Huaiqun, since the defendant failed to appear, he requested an arrest warrant. Subsequently, the plaintiff, Feng Sulan, presented herself. Feng was wearing a white-based, light red floral cheongsam, silk stockings, and leather shoes. Standing in the witness stand, she calmly recounted her love affair, appearing relaxed and not at all embarrassed. She claimed that since she was young, her parents had arranged a marriage for her with someone else, and the wedding was originally scheduled for the eighth day of the fifth lunar month of the year before last. However, in the first month of the same year, she happened to visit Little World in the city and met the defendant, who used all sorts of enticements and sweet words. At that time, she was eighteen years old and easily influenced, so she was seduced and taken to a hotel, where they engaged in sexual relations. The defendant claimed to be unmarried and willing to commit to a lifelong relationship, which she believed to be true. Later, as her wedding date approached, the defendant came to see her again, threatening suicide and demanding that she leave her family. He repeatedly incited her to take all the engagement gifts, including jewelry, and hide at No. 325 Changan Lane, Xinji Bang Road, to live together. Afterwards, she heard that her parents and the groom's family had agreed to dissolve the engagement, so she felt even more uninhibited in her relationship with the defendant. In January of last year, the defendant was involved in a property dispute with his sister and lacked funds to cover all the expenses. He tactfully asked her for help, claiming that she was also involved in the matter. She sold all her jewelry to help him with the lawsuit. Unexpectedly, about ten days later, a woman came to her, hurling insults and claiming to be the defendant's wife. Others persuaded her to leave. From then on, she realized that she had been completely fooled by the defendant. She could only endure and reflect on her situation. She seized an opportunity to question the defendant, who claimed that the woman wanted a divorce and that he truly wished to marry her. He promised that once the lawsuit was over, he would hand over the property deed to her. He said that the woman was merely a wife in name only. Since things had already progressed too far, she felt there was nothing she could do. Later, the defendant planned to open a confectionery shop in Hongzhen and, lacking capital, pleaded with her for help. Considering that they couldn't simply live off her savings, she sold all her remaining jewelry and gave him 900 yuan in installments. In December of the same year, the defendant claimed that he had won the lawsuit and had been awarded a house (the current address at No. 47 Tongzhou Road). After several months, the defendant's behavior changed drastically. Because she thought that their love was not yet broken, she could only be patient. However, the defendant showed no consideration. At first, he would not visit for ten days, then he would disappear for half a month. Since the war in Shanghai started, she was living in the war zone. All the neighbors moved away, leaving her alone in the midst of gunfire, while the defendant never came to comfort her, treating her as if she were a stranger. When they occasionally met, he would insult her with harsh words, completely reversing his previous attitude, and making all kinds of threats, saying that he wanted to kill her. This behavior showed a complete break in their relationship, making it impossible to continue their relationship. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit, demanding that he be punished according to the law and, in addition, filed a civil suit, demanding the return of the 3,000 yuan in clothing, jewelry, and personal savings that she had been deceived out of, as well as all the damages and future living expenses, totaling 20,000 yuan. Judge Wu examined the testimony and, since the defendant was not present, he adjourned the case and ordered the defendant to be summoned for questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Chen Weiru acquitted <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Chen Weiru, a compradore from Yangzhou working for the Jia Li Foreign Firm on Jiangxi Road, was previously accused of defrauding the China Industrial Bank of 14,000 taels of silver under the guise of being a compradore for the foreign firm. The China Industrial Bank hired a lawyer to report the case to the police, who arrested Chen and brought him before the First Special District Court. The defendant hired lawyer Tang Mingshi to represent him. After the interrogation was completed, Chief Judge Qian Hongye of the First Criminal Court declared the defendant Chen Weiru not guilty the morning before yesterday. The private prosecution brought by the China Industrial Bank was rejected, and the related civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for adjudication.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Gun Tax Company discovered in the French Concession <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to begin on the 25th of this month</p>
<p>Since French Consul General Meyrier and Chief Inspector Février took over the French Concession, they have placed the greatest importance on suppressing opium smoking. For several months, they have cracked down on at least a dozen opium cases every day, and recently, they seem to have completely eradicated the practice. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, a reporter from this newspaper was passing by the entrance of Bulin Lane on Zhengjia Muqiao, Avenue Edward VII, when he noticed many strangely dressed men standing there, all looking happy and discussing something animatedly. Upon entering the lane, he saw a black leather sign about two feet long with gold letters on the wall of No. 8 in the lane, which read "Security Company." A young man pointed to the reporter and said, "This is the newly created cigarette pipe tax company resurrected." It was established today (the 22nd). Entering the building, he saw ten wooden counters lined up facing each other, each with a writing desk inside. Two young men were sitting opposite each other. In the corner of the east wall, there was a blackboard with a notice posted on it, which read, "To whom it may concern, all the regulations of this company have already been announced and registration has begun. Anyone who wants to know the details can inquire at the information desk." Below the notice was an oval stamp with the words "Security Company Bingji Stamp 5/23." When asked about the company's founders by two people who appeared to be employees, they said that the company had just been established today and that registration would begin tomorrow (the 23rd). The registration fee is 3.5 yuan for one to five guns and 7 yuan for one to ten guns. Then, starting from the 25th of this month, a fee of five yuan in silver dollars will be charged per gun per day. When asked who founded the company, they were vague. In the evening, when inquiring at the police station, it was learned that there was no such illegal company. It is said that after learning of this, the police station has reported it to the Commissioner of Police and is strictly banning it.</p>

<h3 id="e72">The Executive Yuan responds to the impeachment of Wang Jingwei <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Stating that the signing of the agreement was resolved by the Political Council</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no need to submit it to the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the fact that the Control Yuan has impeached Executive Yuan President Wang for signing the truce agreement without the approval of the Legislative Yuan, a reporter from this newspaper visited Executive Yuan Secretary-General Chu Minyi to inquire about the details. According to Chu, on May 3rd, the Central Political Council, President Wang reported on the Shanghai Truce and Withdrawal Agreement. The Central Political Council resolved to pass it. President Wang continued to ask whether the case should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan. The Central Political Council resolved that it did not need to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan. The Central Political Council is the highest political organ of our party. Since there is the above resolution, the agreement does not need to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Control Yuan's memorial to impeach Wang Jingwei was issued yesterday, it stated that political leaders in various rule-of-law countries are always subject to questioning and impeachment. Those involved should have ample opportunity to respond and should be allowed to publish their responses. The telegram bureau should not withhold their messages, so as to conform to the spirit of the rule of law. Therefore, telegrams to other cities were sent after midnight. The newspapers in this city did not have time to print them. The Executive Yuan stated that since war had not been declared, there could be no negotiation. The Shanghai Truce and Withdrawal Agreement had been reported to the Central Political Council by the Executive Yuan and passed without objection. Moreover, it had been repeatedly stated in advance that the agreement did not have any political conditions attached and was entirely an administrative procedure. Therefore, there was no need to submit it to the Legislative Yuan for resolution. If there were political conditions attached, it would have been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for resolution long ago. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The original case of the Control Yuan's impeachment of Wang Jingwei was proposed by member Gao Youtang, who stated that the signing of the truce agreement without submitting it to the Legislative Yuan for resolution was an inexcusable violation of the law. The Executive Yuan's autocratic and arbitrary actions are of minor importance, but opening this bad precedent would be very dangerous in the future. If not severely punished, then in the future, with regard to national sovereignty and territory, there would be a precedent to follow, and all would be given away under the words "agreement." In order to prevent problems before they arise, he proposed impeachment. After the court handed it over to members Liu San and others for review, they reported that the members believed that since the country is called a rule of law, all measures should follow the rule of law. On the contrary, it is a violation of the law and should be subject to the sanctions of the law. The Organic Law of the National Government stipulates that the Legislative Yuan has the power to resolve declarations of war, peace, and other important international matters. Although this truce agreement is different from a declaration of war or peace, it is undoubtedly an international matter. The Executive Yuan signed it without submitting it to the Legislative Yuan for resolution, which is a clear violation of the law. Moreover, things are always changing. In the future, external precedents can be agreed upon at will, and the dangers cannot be overstated. Member Gao's application for punishment is indeed appropriate. After receiving the report, the court presented it to the Central Supervisory Committee members to propose impeachment in accordance with Article 10, Section 1 of Chapter 3 of the Civil Servant Disciplinary Act, and the entire case was announced on the afternoon of the 21st. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenhui telegraphed Ma Ze Zhao, the representative of Xikang stationed in Beijing, stating that the Tibetan troops are still resisting stubbornly in the Dabai area and that the situation is serious. He requested that the central government be appealed to, based on popular opinion, to provide assistance quickly. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Tang Ke san talks about the negotiation process <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Ke San returned to Beijing yesterday and talked about the occurrence of the Kang Tibetan dispute. The Dalai Lama telegraphed the central government, asking to send personnel familiar with the Tibetan situation to Kang to handle the matter, and stated that he had ordered the Da Jin side to stop military action and return to their original defense. I started on April 3rd of last year. When I arrived in Chongqing, I suddenly heard that the Tibetan army had occupied Ganzi. When I arrived in Chengdu, I heard that the Tibetan army had occupied Zhanhua. I couldn't succeed with my bare hands. I telegraphed asking the Dalai Lama to withdraw his troops. In June, I arrived in Kangding and learned that the Dalai Lama had sent Changdu Kalon as his representative and Qiong Rang Daiben to Ganzi to negotiate. On July 8th, I arrived in Lhuo and sent Liu Yuan to Gan to connect with Qiong Rang to retreat the Gan Zhan Tibetan army, and to urge the Kalon to come to Gan to meet. Unexpectedly, Qiong and others delayed for reasons and never fulfilled the promise of retreat, negotiating for more than a month and only agreeing to go to Dege, while the troops in Gan Zhan still did not withdraw. I secretly reported to the central government and requested that the three provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Qing be ordered to use force to recover, not only to recover Gan Zhan, but also to restore the entire Kang. Before the joint efforts, it was proposed that Liu Chengxun send a brigade of troops and use the Zhan Ding militia. I went to Gan first to negotiate with the Tibetan side, but Liu was unable to implement it for some reason. At that time, the central government was dealing with Shi Yousan's rebellion and had no time to take care of the southwestern incident, so it could not be implemented. I could not exercise my power in Lhuo, nor could I command the troops. Empty negotiations were of no avail. After dragging on for several months, when the Northeast Incident occurred, the Dalai Lama took the opportunity to urgently request the central government to discuss the Dabai incident first, and other issues would be handled separately. I argued that border defense relations were important and argued that it was impossible. Because Dabai is all under the jurisdiction of Ganzi, and Gan Zhan is the gateway to Xikang. If we don't try to recover it, the gateway will be lost and Kang will be in danger. I repeatedly telegraphed, rather than only discussing Dabai and not talking about Gan Zhan, it would be better to leave them all as pending cases, and order the Sichuan army to firmly defend the current defense, and wait for the Sino Japanese incident to settle down before handling it. As a result, the Tibetan side spread rumors, saying that it had already been handled with the central government, causing the people of the four counties of Gan Jian Zhan Li to panic and express their unwillingness to return to Tibet. If only Dabai is discussed and Ganzi is discussed in depth, then the entire Kang will be shaken from the roots. I requested to resign from the central government due to the difficulty in handling the matter, and another virtuous person was sent. I was not approved. In order to seek perfection, I negotiated with the Tibetan representative Qiong Rang, and in accordance with the central government's intentions, I formulated ten conditions for peace with Tibet, which were approved by the central government, but the Tibetan side expressed opposition in the middle of the way, resulting in a breakdown. At that time, I had become the target of public criticism, and the Kang people also referred to me as an envoy to cede land. My old illness recurred, and I asked to resign again. Fortunately, I was approved and General Liu Jun was sent to handle it with full authority. On the 20th of last month, the handover was completed and I set off to return to Beijing. When I arrived in Chengdu, I learned that Gesang Zeren had invaded Batang and shot and killed Brigade Commander Ma, and Kangnan was also in an emergency. Now Liu has sent Brigade Commander Yu to defend it. Recently, I received a telegram from General Liu Jun, stating that Gan Zhan had been captured. Of the thirty-three counties in Xikang, six or seven have been divided. If there is no way to solve it, not only will the proposal to establish a province be disappointed, but in a year, there will be no land left in Xikang. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Draft of Kang Tibetan Peace Conditions <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The ten drafts of Kang Tibetan Peace Conditions are as follows: Article 1. Now we follow the central government's telegram order to seek Kang Tibetan peace. Ganzi and Zhanhua are temporarily stationed by Tibetan troops, and will be handled separately in the future. According to this article, it is based on the central government's and the Dalai Lama's direct agreement and telegram order, and there is no room for consultation in Gan, so it is stipulated as above. Article 2. After the Dabai case is completed by impartial handling this time, the Qiong Rang representative will be responsible for ensuring that this kind of thing does not happen again. According to the peace conditions, the contract must be signed after the Dabai case is concluded. The case is judged by Qiong Rang, and our side monitors it. If it is unfair, our side can refuse to sign the contract, and there are six other measures to settle Dabai, which are attached later.</p>
<p>Article 3. The Kang party will station 200 troops in Lhuo and Daofu, and the Tibetan party will station 200 troops in Ganzi and Zhanhua. The rest will be withdrawn, and the two parties shall not initiate conflicts without authorization. If any party causes trouble, the government will handle it. The reason for the incident will be announced and testified by the central committee member in the government meeting.</p>
<p>Article 4. Qiongxia two villages still belong to Lihua, and Zhu Wo originally belonged to Lhuo, and will be returned.</p>
<p>Article 5. More than 77,000 taels of silver owed by the Dajin Temple to the Lhucheng Chamber of Commerce will be ordered by Qiong Rang Daiben to be returned quickly by the temple. According to this article, a method of repaying the money in installments has been proposed. At the end of the lunar year, 20,000 taels will be repaid first, 20,000 taels will be repaid at the end of February next year, 20,000 taels will be repaid at the end of April, and the payment will be cleared at the end of June.</p>
<p>Article 6. Jia Ben Abo Bu and other two people from Bai Qu will return to Gan and wait for Qiong Rang to judge impartially. The Tibetan party shall not abuse them in the slightest. If there are things that hinder freedom and damage their lives, after the judgment is completed, Qiong Rang will report to the Dalai Lama, and the central committee member will also report to the government and the conference in the same way. After this case is concluded, the Tibetan party shall treat the people of Bai Li equally.</p>
<p>Article 7. The Tibetan party once gave the captured Sichuan army food and clothing. The central committee member will discuss with the Sichuan government to allocate money to return it and release them all. According to this article, the Tibetan party gave more than 130 captured soldiers food and clothing for one year, and Zhang Zhishi and others have lived there for several years, and have paid for it. They requested that it be returned. Zhang Zhishi has now been sent back first. The captured soldiers will not be released until the money is returned. After further consultations, it was agreed that 20,000 Tibetan oceans, totaling more than 8,000 silver dollars, would be included in the text of the agreement when it is formally signed.</p>
<p>Article 8. Brigade Commander Ma and Qiong Niang Daiben will send people to meet each other to explain the previous suspicion.</p>
<p>Article 9. Restore transportation and protect commerce. The Chinese and merchants stationed in Tibet who go to Lhucheng for trade will be treated equally by both parties.</p>
<p>Article 10. The above nine articles are temporary truce conditions. All Kang Tibetan issues will be handled separately. If there is any ambiguity in the interpretation of the articles, Chinese shall prevail.</p>
<p>It has been found that there were a total of eight original conditions, and then Article 6 and Article 10 were added, making a total of ten. They have been sent separately to the Mongolian Tibetan Committee General Liu Jun for review, and this will be the standard when it is formally signed. This is hereby declared.

<p>(Bengbu) On the 22nd, the British Vice-Consul, Colin Hadden, was traveling by the Yu Shun steamer from Bengbu to Shou. A team from the Fourth Division was dispatched to escort him. When they arrived at Taoyuanzi, eight miles from Bengbu, a soldier from a certain checkpoint of the Twelfth Division accidentally fired a gun while testing it, injuring Hadden. The bullet entered from the left shoulder and exited from the buttocks, causing a lot of bleeding. He was immediately transported back and sent to the Wenfang Hospital for treatment. At 3:00 PM, a foreign employee from the Northern Anhui Rehabilitation Office, Yubanke, accompanied Hadden by car back to Nanjing. The soldier who caused the incident has been taken into custody. The Rehabilitation Office telegraphed Zhu Qinglan and Xin Bosen to report the incident. (Special Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e118">Viscount Saitō Entrusted with Forming a Cabinet <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The End of Party Rule in Japan</p>
<p>A Transcendent Cabinet Finally Realized</p>
<p>Selection of Cabinet Members Still Requires Some Time</p>
<p>Ishii Tentatively Appointed as Foreign Minister, Wakatsuki as Finance Minister</p>
<p>United Press Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: Prince Saionji entered the palace to see the Emperor at 1:27 PM today, recommending Viscount Saitō Makoto as the next Prime Minister. Saitō was summoned to the palace at 6:35 PM to receive the order to form a cabinet. After leaving the palace, he immediately telegraphed Count Kodama Hideo, the former Director-General of Korean Affairs, and Tsurukichi Maruyama, the former Superintendent-General of the Metropolitan Police, to discuss the principles for organizing a new cabinet. He scheduled to meet with Suzuki, the President of the Seiyukai, and Wakatsuki, the President of the Minseitō, tomorrow morning to discuss cabinet formation and requested that both presidents join the cabinet to jointly save the current crisis.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd: Count Kodama told reporters after meeting with the new Prime Minister Saitō today that the Prime Minister intends to consult with Elder Prince Saionji on the formation of the new cabinet tomorrow and seek his understanding. It is expected that the composition of the new cabinet will take as long as a week, as the situation is extremely complicated and requires extremely careful consideration. It is widely believed that Saitō may invite Viscount Ishii to serve as Foreign Minister and Wakatsuki to serve as Finance Minister. The Navy Ministry has already tentatively nominated Admiral Okada to serve as Navy Minister.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Who will be the Minister of the Army in the Saitō Cabinet is most noteworthy. Army Minister Araki may remain in office due to the sincere wishes of Chief of Staff Masaki, Commander of the Military Police Qin, and other military officials. As for the post of Navy Minister, Admiral Abo is the most likely candidate.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Saitō has begun forming his cabinet at his private residence in Yotsuya Nakamachi, designating former Superintendent-General of the Metropolitan Police Tsurukichi Maruyama as Cabinet Secretary. Count Kodama Hideo also appears likely to join the cabinet.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Saitō's Brief Biography <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Viscount Saitō was born in Iwate Prefecture in 1858 and is currently 74 years old. He was poor in his youth (and served as a clerk in the Navy Department, the same as Hara Takashi and Gotō Shinpei, and later all three rose to high positions, which is considered a beautiful story). Through diligence and learning, he gradually rose to his current position and is even hailed as one of the three great men of Tohoku in modern Japan, along with Hara Takashi and Gotō Shinpei. He was appointed a Navy Ensign in 1882 and promoted to Navy Admiral in 1906. During this time, he served as a military aide, captain of the Akitsushima and Izumo ships. When Yamamoto was Navy Minister, Saitō served as Vice Minister. From 1906, he successively served as Navy Minister in the Saionji, Katsura, and Yamamoto cabinets for a total of eight years. In 1913, he resigned due to the naval bribery scandal and was incorporated into the reserve army. In 1919, the Hara cabinet was formed, and he accepted Hara Takashi's trust and served as Governor-General of Korea. After the March 1st Movement (the Korean independence movement in the Republic of China in 1919), he strongly advocated abolishing the policy of military rule. He was granted the title of Viscount in 1907. In 1927, he served as the chief representative of the Geneva Naval Disarmament Conference. After returning home, he resigned as Governor-General of Korea and became a Privy Councilor. In 1929, he accepted</p>

<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi's earnest request and re-assumed the position of Governor-General of Korea. He resigned in June 1930 and is currently the Chairman of the Japan-Russia Association and the Chairman of the Japan Enlightenment Organizations Federation, a large federation of Japanese fascist organizations (United Press Agency). Former Governor-General of Korea, Navy Admiral Viscount Saitō Makoto, once served as Navy Minister and represented Japan at the Geneva Naval Conference in 1927. Two years later, he re-assumed the position of Governor-General of Korea, a position he had previously held for eight years. In the past two years, he has lived a life of leisure and has not been much involved in politics. Although Saitō is old, his appointment as Prime</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Minister will surely bring peace and order both domestically and internationally. When he participated in the Geneva Three-Power Naval Conference in 1927, he demonstrated his diplomatic skills. He also achieved remarkable political achievements when he governed Korea. He is a man of great magnanimity and strict self-discipline. At a time when the people of the country are restless and politics are corrupt, the emergence of such talent to take charge of politics is particularly appropriate. Therefore, the navy, army, and business community all expressed satisfaction after hearing the news today (Reuters).</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Process of Recommending Saitō to Form a Cabinet <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yamamoto is Old, Hiranuma is Biased</p>
<p>Saionji Decisively Suppresses the Political Tide</p>
<p>National News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: Since Duke Saionji arrived in Kyoto, he has repeatedly met with senior statesmen and veterans over the past three days to seek their opinions on resolving the political crisis. The military, which strongly advocates overthrowing the party cabinet, and the civil servants, who advocate upholding the constitution and maintaining the party cabinet, have made their respective arguments. After carefully listening to the arguments of all parties, Saionji made a decisive decision, abandoning Hiranuma, the leader of the Kokuhonsha, who is at the center of the political tide, and Suzuki, the new president of the Seiyukai, and recommending Viscount Saitō Makoto, the former Governor-General of Korea and Navy Admiral, who is unrelated to both, to form a transcendent cabinet. This both reluctantly accedes to the military's request to form a national unity cabinet and can slightly appease the party's spirit, thereby easing the dispute as a temporary transition. Thus, at 1:30 PM today, he entered the palace to see the Emperor, presented his case for about an hour, and formally recommended Saitō to form a cabinet. The Emperor naturally approved, and the Imperial Household Agency first informed Viscount Saitō by telephone, and then Okamoto conveyed the order and formally summoned Saitō to Kyoto. Saitō then entered Kyoto around 6:00 PM that evening, met the Emperor, and received the imperial order to form a cabinet. However, since a transcendent cabinet is being formed this time, and it is in the midst of a dispute between two factions, the selection of cabinet members will be a difficult task and it is feared that it will not be possible to announce them in a short time.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Prince Saionji received a visit from Navy Minister Osumi at 8:00 this morning, followed by a visit from Marshal Togo. At 10:20, Minister of the Imperial Household Makino visited for a final consultation. Thus, Prince Saionji's meetings with senior statesmen were completed. Regarding the next Prime Minister, there was initially talk of choosing one from among four people: Suzuki, the President of the Seiyukai; Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō; Count Yamamoto Gonnohyōe; and Saitō Makoto. Count Yamamoto, with his qualifications as a veteran, has a high reputation, and the senior statesmen unanimously recommended him. However, there are doubts as to whether he can handle this difficult task at the advanced age of 81. If Baron Hiranuma forms a cabinet, his policies will inevitably be biased towards one side, which is quite dangerous. Therefore, due to these various factors, Saitō Makoto is the most suitable candidate and has received the support of a majority of senior statesmen. Therefore, he recommended Saitō.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Military Circles Are Exuberant <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>United Press Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: It is reported that the military and the Adachi faction are both satisfied with the appointment of Viscount Saitō to form a cabinet. Zhongye and Otsuka, etc., from the Adachi faction, gathered at Adachi's residence to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Regarding the next cabinet, the main body within the Army Department insists that the next cabinet should belong to an established political party. If it can realize the reality of a national unity cabinet, it will not object to its people. The young officers argue that the occurrence of this unfortunate incident is due to the corruption of the established political parties, so they absolutely oppose anyone with party membership in the established political parties. The two factions were initially opposed to each other. Recently, the main body has strongly consoled the young officers, arguing that if things are done as the young officers advocate, the political situation will only become more chaotic, and the responsibility must be borne by the military. Currently, the general trend in the military is that unless it is a cabinet of Suzuki alone, the strong arguments from the past can be expected to soften somewhat.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: The opinion of the Minseitō leadership is that when Viscount Saitō comes to negotiate on cabinet members, they will send party representatives to the cabinet depending on the conditions. Therefore, they held an emergency executive meeting to decide everything. Currently, the talk of President Wakatsuki joining the cabinet is more powerful. Yamamoto Yutatsu and Machida Chuji, etc., have also been named as strong candidates. Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Viscount Saitō has been ordered to form a cabinet. President Wakatsuki said at his private residence that as a political party figure, he would normally hope for a party cabinet, but in a major national crisis, even the Seiyukai, with 300 members, cannot form a cabinet, so it must be regarded as unavoidable. As for whether the Minseitō will join the cabinet, it will depend on the policies of the cabinet, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Cracks Appear Within the Seiyukai <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Regarding the Saitō cabinet, the Seiyukai has those who advocate non-entry into the cabinet, those who adhere to the principle of right and wrong, and those who advocate the entry of several people into the cabinet to implement a cooperative cabinet, with divided opinions. The elders of the anti-Suzuki faction, such as Kuhara, Mikami, Mochizuki, and Okazaki, etc., believe that entry into the cabinet is appropriate. Secretary-General Mori also visited Takahashi Korekiyo at 4:30 PM today, seemingly saying that the Seiyukai should also enter the cabinet, but the attitude can only be decided after Viscount Saitō meets with President Suzuki.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: The Seiyukai believes that if Saitō asks President Suzuki for assistance, they will hold an executive meeting to decide on their attitude. However, the anti-Suzuki faction is rampant within the government and the party. If President Suzuki rejects the entry of Seiyukai members into the cabinet due to the issue of face, then there will be disputes within the party. In this case, the Suzuki faction and the anti-Suzuki faction will inevitably split greatly. United Press Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: Tokonami and Kuhara are angry that President Suzuki does not respect the party's organs and discusses the situation in private with Hatoyama and Mori, making light comments, causing resentment from senior statesmen and veterans. It is reported that Tokonami will lead the Satsuma faction politicians to contact the Kuhara-Adachi faction and actively support a national unity cabinet. If the imperial order is not bestowed upon the Seiyukai, the party will surely split greatly.</p>

<p>London Circles Are Deeply Worried</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: The entanglement of the Japanese political situation is becoming increasingly apparent. People in London are very suspicious. Since the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi, the changes in the situation have all demonstrated that the results of this heinous case have not weakened the power of the militarists. Therefore, the danger of a Russo-Japanese war has increased, and the hope for a "reasonable" handling of the Sino-Japanese problem has also been dashed. As for the serious</p>
<p>People, they are temporarily left aside. The Observer said that the assassination of Inukai Tsuyoshi was a misfortune for Japan, and also a misfortune for the world. The Sunday Times discussed the dangerous and perverse policies pursued by Japan in Shanghai and Manchuria, and involved the crisis of the Russo-Japanese war, saying that an incident with dire consequences for the future of the world has now been discovered in Russia. The world urgently needs to understand its relationship and not underestimate it. The Sunday Pictorial reported that the London military and the major powers all believe that the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese armies in the future cannot be stopped.</p>

<p>Havas, Geneva, 22nd: The Georgian Intelligence Bureau in Geneva received Soviet military news from Tbilisi stating that Soviet Russia is rapidly preparing for an "imminent" war everywhere and is transforming most factories to manufacture munitions, while the Caucasus region is already in a state of combat. The various measures currently being taken are sufficient to prove this. Soviet Russia has already appointed General Smolin as the commander-in-chief of all troops in the Caucasus region and has granted him very broad powers. In addition, an order has recently been issued appointing Stalin's loyal friends, such as Alaglov, the secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Caucasus, and Beria, Polonsky, and Gagan, the secretaries of the Communist Parties of Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan, as members of the Military Commission of the Caucasus Red Army, etc.</p>

The Vice Admiral said that Russia has long had ambitions for Manchuria, which is an indelible fact in history, but he does not believe that Soviet Russia can exert its ambitions at this time. The Vice Admiral added that Soviet Russia's propaganda is already extremely annoying, but the occurrence of a war between Japan and Russia is extremely unlikely.</p>

<p>Mainly due to Financial Problems</p>
<p>National General Strike Begins</p>
<p>National News Agency, Athens, 21st – The Greek cabinet resigned today. Government agencies are at a standstill due to a general strike by all employees. Government personnel are demanding a general pay raise. The government authorities have mobilized strong military forces to guard government agencies and have set up machine guns to prevent any unforeseen events.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Athens, 21st – After the resignation of the Venizelos cabinet, Mr. Venizelos advocated for the formation of a coalition government, including representatives of the royalist party, believing that this was the only way to cope with the current situation. The government recently promulgated a new press law prohibiting newspapers from criticizing the authorities, which has met with strong opposition from the people. It is now believed that this is one of the reasons for the cabinet's resignation. The strike wave is worsening, with postal and telecommunications partially disrupted, and telephone service completely cut off nationwide. The army's radio stations are now providing round-the-clock service to maintain intelligence communication between the government and local officials in various provinces. Some officials in inland tax offices have also joined the strike, and there have been several clashes between strikers and the military. There are fears that the unrest will spread to all of Thessaly and Macedonia. The authorities have dispatched additional warships to the troubled areas.</p>
<p>Reuters, Athens, 21st – The Greek government resigned today due to financial difficulties and the suspension of foreign debt payments. It is reported that before resigning, the government sent letters to the governments of Britain, France, and Italy, expressing concerns that it would be forced to over-issue currency, leading to a sharp devaluation of the currency.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 22nd – The financial situation of Austria and Greece is on the verge of collapse, making everyone increasingly aware that the Lausanne reparations conference is urgently needed to prevent a major disaster from spreading. However, negotiations are now at least underway. It is now believed that Britain's policy aims to create an atmosphere advocating for gradual global improvement rather than seeking immediate and massive effects. For example, Britain is now trying to extend the Hoover moratorium plan to allow for more permanent negotiations after the U.S. elections. It is also seeking to achieve a genuine understanding between France and Germany and to seize the opportunity to transform it into a "Super Locarno" conference. However, judging from the remarks of former French Prime Minister Herriot, this goal has not yet been achieved, as Mr. Herriot stated that French foreign policy would not change due to changes in government. However, according to well-informed French reporters, France is now considering: (1) Reparations and Allied war debts can be suspended but not canceled; (2) Reduce military spending before the results of the disarmament conference; (3) Implement a major development of the Danube plan, allowing France, Poland, Italy, and Germany to share the benefits. From this, it can be seen that France also attaches great importance to the Lausanne conference.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st – The Athens International Financial Committee has formally protested to the Greek government for failing to fulfill its foreign debt obligations. The British representative also participated in this protest. The British government has now received a reply from the Greek government stating that due to Greece's financial difficulties, the government had no choice but to temporarily not convert the funds due on May 1st for foreign debt payments into foreign currency. If it continues to repay foreign debts, the only way to make up for the budget deficit would be to issue more banknotes, which would cause the price of Greek currency to plummet due to the over-issuance of banknotes. The Greek government hopes to temporarily suspend foreign debt payments pending the outcome of the Lausanne conference and seek an agreement with the creditor nations. At that time, Greece will do its utmost to propose a satisfactory solution that will benefit the creditors. The Greek government is prepared to submit the entire issue to arbitration to determine Greece's ability to repay its debts. It is reported that the French and Italian governments have also received similar replies from Greece.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 22nd – The League of Nations Administrative Council met today to discuss the poverty of Eastern European countries, but without result. It only passed a resolution asking Austria and Greece to make every effort to respect all obligations while the League of Nations Financial Committee discusses their difficulties.</p>

<p>Covering Two Thousand Miles in Sixteen Hours</p>
<p>Mrs. Putnam Completes her Ambitious Goal</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st – Mrs. Putnam, the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic, landed near Londonderry in Ireland, having flown a straight line of two thousand miles in sixteen hours, a new record. When she departed from Newfoundland, she told people, "You can hear good news from me in fifteen hours." Her words proved true. Five years ago, Colonel Lindbergh made a similar feat, reaching Paris directly. Mrs. Putnam's flight ended in Ireland due to a leaking fuel tank. News of her success was warmly welcomed by people in New York, London, and Paris. Her husband, a prominent publisher in New York, told Reuters, "I knew she could do it." Mrs. Putnam, 34, whose original name was O'Herte, married last year. People call her the female Lindbergh because her flying achievements are very similar to those of Colonel Lindbergh. The only food she took on her voyage was a bottle of chicken broth. It has been fifteen times before that the Atlantic has been crossed from west to east, but Mrs. Putnam is the first to fly two thousand miles in sixteen hours. Four years ago, Mrs. Putnam flew across the Atlantic for the first time with two aviators. She then engaged in social work in the United States, but still practiced flying from time to time. Mrs. Putnam has now received many congratulatory telegrams from all over the world.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 21st – President Hoover has telegraphed Mrs. Putnam to congratulate her on her successful solo flight across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 21st – Female aviator Mrs. Putnam successfully crossed the Atlantic on the fifth anniversary of Colonel Lindbergh's crossing of the Atlantic, which is why the entire United States is particularly jubilant.</p>

<h3 id="e131">League of Nations Investigation Team in Jilin Province <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Closely Monitoring the Team</p>
<p>Representative Gu Wanders Along the Banks of the Songhua River</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Jilin - Jilin Correspondence: The League of Nations investigation team arrived in Jilin at about 6:00 AM on the 7th, taking a special train from Changchun via the Jilin-Changchun Railway. The route was guarded by railway garrison troops, road police, and police from the Jilin and Changchun County Protection Corps. At about 7:00 AM, representatives from various counties and sectors in the country, as well as reception staff and representatives of Japanese and Korean residents, gathered at the station. At that time, the inside and outside of the station were heavily guarded. A little after 9:30 AM, the train arrived at the station. Xi Qia's representative Secretary-General Li, the puppet education director Rong Mengmei, the puppet industry director Sun Qichang, the Japanese Consul-General in Jilin Ishiya, and the Japanese military division representative Chief of Staff Ueno Ryōichi, all went to the platform to greet the delegation. After the five committee members from the United States, Britain, Germany, France, and Italy got off the train, they stood together on the platform. The puppet government and Japanese welcoming personnel stepped forward to greet them. Japanese participating member Yoshida, Chinese participating member Gu Weijun, and the puppet government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director-General Oohashi also accompanied the team with three attendants. The five committee members then boarded cars and left the station, and accompanied by some attendants and Japanese participating member Ambassador Yoshida, etc., visited the Japanese Consul-General and rested briefly. The Chinese participating member, along with attendants and investigators, went directly to the provincial government office to rest. At 9:50 AM, the five committee members went to the Japanese Second Division Headquarters in the South Manchuria Railway Company to visit Division Commander Tamon, inquiring about the course of the military operations in Jilin. At about 11:00 AM, Gu Weijun and Chinese and foreign attendants went to Beishan to climb the Chengjiang Pavilion and view the scenery. At 12:30 PM, they went down the mountain and headed straight to the club. At 12:40 PM, the committee members finished their visit to the Second Division Headquarters and also went to the club. At 1:00 PM, the puppet provincial government hosted a Western-style lunch in the large dining hall, inviting the committee members and attendants. After lunch, due to the short time, they did not visit the puppet provincial government again, but met with the puppet provincial government Secretary-General Li and the two puppet directors Rong and Sun in the club's living room. During the meeting, Lord Lytton asked questions and Li answered, as follows: (Question) After the establishment of "Manchukuo", has there been any reorganization of the situation in Jilin? I would like to know. (Answer) Jilin has gradually reorganized after the establishment of the new country, and all politics have progressed. (Question) I heard that the currency system in Jilin is very chaotic. What is the reason? (Answer) The currency system in Jilin is a local system, with two types of official notes and Yongda Yang, which are inconvertible paper currencies, and their credit has been greatly reduced, which is why they are chaotic. (Question) Does the chaos of the currency system cause losses to the people? (Answer) Of course the people suffer losses. In the past, two strings and five hundred cash could be exchanged for one silver dollar, but now one silver dollar can be exchanged for more than five hundred and eighty strings, which is very different from the past. (Question) I understand. The chaos of Jilin official notes is the same reason as the chaos of Fengda Yang, but are there any ways to improve and remedy it? (Answer) The new country is now planning to build a bank to recover local paper currency, and is in the process of preparation. (Question) How many types of taxes and levies are there in Jilin, and have there been any facts of increased taxes and levies after the incident? (Answer) The types of taxes and levies in Jilin are roughly land tax, sales tax, and consumption tax. There have been no increases after the incident, and the 20% military expenditure added by the warlords has been exempted. (Question) What kinds of suffering did the people suffer from the warlords in the past? (Answer) Due to the large number of troops trained and the large number of guns purchased, the currency system was chaotic, bandits multiplied, many bandits were attracted, and corruption and perversion of the law were innumerable. (Question) Have the people suffered from the Kuomintang? (Answer) Fortunately, the Kuomintang people in Jilin did not stay long, and their policies were not implemented, otherwise, of course, the people would have suffered. (Question) What is the recent bandit situation in Jilin Province? I don't know if there is a way to deal with it? (Answer) The bandits in Jilin are currently being suppressed. At this point, Lord Lytton stood up, shook hands and said goodbye. At 3:30 PM, he arrived at Jilin Station and boarded the original train to leave Jilin. (8th)</p>
<p>Situation Upon Arrival in Harbin - Harbin Correspondence: The International League of Nations investigation team was originally scheduled to arrive in Harbin on the 8th, but due to various reasons, it did not arrive until the afternoon of the 9th. At that time, the station was under heavy guard. People from all walks of life, shocked by the importance of the investigation team's mission, rushed to the station to observe. At about 4:00 PM, the southern end of the station and both sides of the station street were filled with six to seven hundred people standing and waiting respectfully. However, the Japanese had previously ordered the police station in charge to block all convenient roads with ropes, so that the public was separated from the team. Those who came to the station to welcome the team included Bao Guancheng, chairman of the reception committee set up by the puppet government, and committee members Li Shaogeng, Shen Ruilin, Song Wenlin, Wang Ruihua, Shi Lüben, Zhao Bojun, Xia Shaokang, etc. The team's cars were provided by the Japanese, with three flags interspersed. The center was a pink rectangular small flag with the words "Welcome the International League of Nations Investigation Team." on it. The left was the "Manchukuo" puppet flag, and the right was a hexagonal small flag, including the flags of Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan, but without the Chinese national flag. At 5:15 PM, the team's advance car entered the station. At 5:35 PM, the special train arrived. Lord Lytton got out of the car with a smile. Japanese participating member Yoshida introduced Bao Guancheng and others to Lord Lytton and they shook hands. Puppet government Foreign Minister Xie Jieshi and the puppet government's participating member Oohashi Chuuichi, a Japanese national, also came. After leaving the station, led by the station master, Bao Guancheng accompanied Lord Lytton, Li Shaogeng accompanied Italian representative Marest Galli, Shen Ruilin accompanied French representative Claude, Xia Shaogeng accompanied US representative Macquay, Song Wenlin accompanied German representative Sheni, Shi Lüben accompanied Japanese participating member Yoshida and Chinese participating member Gu Weijun, etc., and continued to board the cars and drove to Daoli. The attendants took the cars behind them and stayed in 54 rooms of various sizes on the second floor of the Modern Hotel and 11 rooms on the second floor of the Balas Hotel. Security police were stationed in front of the hotel and nearby areas, strictly monitoring the area.</p>
<p>Visiting Hirose: The 11th was the first day of the League of Nations investigation team's official work in Harbin. At about 10:00 AM, Lord Lytton led the committee members and more than 30 attendants in cars to visit Japanese Army Division Commander Hirose. In each car, in addition to the driver, there was also a plainclothes police officer to monitor them. Between every two cars, there was a three-wheeled car with armed police. In front and behind each car, there was a car of the security team, fully loaded with armed security police. The former was a pistol team, and the latter was a team of police officers holding large guns. These police officers were all commanded by the Japanese, and the strictness of their surveillance can be imagined. After arriving at the Japanese Army Headquarters in Nangang, Hirose welcomed them to the large living room. After exchanging pleasantries, Lord Lytton first questioned them, followed by US representative General Macquay and French representative General Claude. The main focus of their questions was the general situation in northern Manchuria, and the current situation and deployment of the Jilin Army and the old Jilin Army. They also inquired about Ma Zhanshan's recent attitude and had a very long question-and-answer session. The main points were Ma's actions, the number of troops, and the names of the commanders. Finally, they also briefly questioned the issue of the Communist Party's incitement. At about 11:40 AM, they left the Japanese Army Headquarters. Lord Lytton went to the British Consulate, and the German representative went to the German Consulate. The other representatives and attendants returned to the hotel for lunch. At about 3:00 PM, Lord Lytton returned from the British Consulate. Without getting out of the car, he invited the committee members and attendants to go to the Preparatory Office of the Greater Harbin Municipality in Nangang to visit puppet Mayor Bao Guancheng. At 4:50 PM, he left.</p>
<p>Also yesterday (11th) at 9:00 AM, several White Russian intellectuals (mostly members of the former Manchuria Research Association), including Tolmachev, went to the Modern Hotel to meet with the investigation team's Russian secretary, Pastukhov, and talked for a long time, making some kind of detailed report. Afterwards, several White Russian residents' representatives talked with people in the investigation team, describing the situation during the old authorities' era and the current new government. These reports were all recorded by the team.</p>
<p>While the investigation team is in Harbin, the committee members are not allowed to talk to reporters without the permission of the chairman, Lord Lytton, and may not be able to express anything to anyone at all. As for the chairman, Lord Lytton, he will meet with the reporters in two or three days. According to the secretary-general of the investigation team, Mr. Haas, starting yesterday (11th), the team will set up a distribution department to provide news about the progress of the investigation team's work every day. The head of the department will be Mr. Baird, an attendant of the investigation team.</p>
<p>Gu's Attitude: My country's participating member, Gu Weijun, who has attracted a lot of attention from all parties, ordered no less than 20 copies of Chinese and foreign newspapers from Harbin and Western newspapers after arriving in Harbin. After breakfast, he began to read them for a very long time. When the five country representatives and attendants went to the Japanese Army Headquarters and the Preparatory Office of the Greater Harbin Municipality, Gu did not participate. The day before yesterday (10th) at 5:00 PM, Gu and attendant Du Narit walked out of the Modern Hotel. At that time, the reporters from various countries were very surprised. After leaving the hotel, Gu only walked with Du Narit to the banks of the Songhua River. After strolling along Central Avenue, he turned into the Municipal Park and returned to the hotel an hour later. Yesterday (11th) at 4:40 PM, Gu and an attendant of the British representative went to the Modern Hotel and slowly walked to the Songhua River to look into the distance. Gu's attitude was quite calm, and he talked to the Englishman as he walked. Also, the itinerary of the investigation team in Harbin is scheduled for 10:00 AM on the 12th to meet with the Japanese representative and Consul-General Nagaoka, 1:00 PM to meet with the director of the East Railway Li Shaogeng, 10:00 AM on the 13th to visit the Japanese Consulate-General and meet with Komatsubara, the head of the Special Affairs Agency, and 3:00 PM to meet with Zhang Shu, the supervisor of the East Railway.

<p>Songjiang Bank went bankrupt and the president absconded. The county court appointed accountants Xi Yushu and Xia Sunhuan to be responsible for the liquidation. They opened an office in the court to handle matters. They began registering creditors on the 18th and urged the repayment of loans, with a deadline of 10 days. The bank's property and all assets were auctioned off first. The minimum price was 4,200 yuan. The bids were opened in public in the court yesterday. As a result, Fuyoutang won the bid with 15,111 yuan, 1 jiao, and 1 fen. The land base of the property belongs to the West House of the Prison Temple. In the 18th year, the bank president leased the land to build a house for a period of 20 years, paying a monthly rent of 40 yuan. A contract was signed. The house was built only three years ago, and the location is in the center of the downtown area, so there were as many as ten bidders. It is reported that the winning bidder will use it to set up a Songjiang branch of a Shanghai silver company.</p>

<p>Due to the impact of the Shanghai war and the stagnation of finance, the county's commercial accounts for last year could not be settled on New Year's Eve as usual and have been repeatedly postponed. It has been decided to conduct supplementary accounting at the end of May. The County Chamber of Commerce believes that there are not many days left. How to proceed with the accounting at the deadline was discussed at yesterday's regular meeting. A unanimous resolution was passed that all accounts for last year should be collected without regard to day or night at the end of this month. The financial and pawn industries will also be open day and night. The city will rest for one day on June 1st. All trade associations will be notified of this.</p>

<p>Lu Guozhong, captain of the first water police team, along with Tan Jinfu, captain of the Jinshan water patrol team, captured a major bandit, Wu Changfu, in Fuhuangdai the day before yesterday. After bringing him back for preliminary interrogation, he confessed that he was from Anhui and worked as a salt smuggler. He had partnered with Qin Banglin, Zhou Shaopeng, and others to commit robberies. Wu is a wanted criminal whom the bandit suppression command in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces offered a reward of 200 yuan for his arrest. He has been escorted to the district headquarters for interrogation.</p>

<p>Our county suffered from a major flood last year, and the fields were submerged. This spring, disasters remain everywhere. The local authorities were ordered to organize an accounting branch to prepare for any unforeseen events. However, Li Yunshu, the chairman of the relief branch, surprisingly made a profit from it. The price of the Wenzhou dried sweet potatoes purchased was no more than one yuan, seven or eight jiao, to two yuan per dan. However, after being transported back, it was said that they were sold at the original price, with each jin retailing for 120 wen, which amounts to a huge four yuan and several fen. A total of tens of thousands of dan were sold, making a profit of more than 20,000 yuan. However, the report of the relief branch stated that there was a loss of more than 10,000 yuan. The people of the county believe that there is a dark secret behind this. They sent Gong Weifan, Cao Tianman, and others to Wenzhou to collect evidence. The Jianghai Daily also telegraphed the Wenzhou Chamber of Commerce and the Party Headquarters, and both obtained written proof. Evidence has been collected and a lawsuit has been filed according to law. Dong knew that the truth was out and that he would inevitably be criticized, so he also made various efforts to cover it up.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Important News: Hubei Education Sector Strikes and Rejects Shen's Tide <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Director Shen of the Education Department Arrives at the Department to Take Office</p>
<p>Education Sector Resigns, Demanding Back Pay, Rejection</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After Shen Shiyuan, Director of the Education Department, took office on the 18th, the teachers and staff of various schools and museums still firmly opposed him. After the decision of the representative assembly, on the 19th, they all resigned from their respective schools and museums and demanded back pay. On the following day, the following formally suspended classes and work: First Middle School, Third Middle School, Ninth Middle School, Twelfth Middle School, First Women's Middle School, Women's Normal School, Rural Normal School, Provincial Normal School, First Elementary School, Third Elementary School, Fourth Elementary School, Fifth Elementary School, Seventh Elementary School, Eighth Elementary School, Fourteenth Elementary School, Fifteenth Elementary School, Experimental Public Education Center, Science Experiment Center, Municipal Vocational School, Municipal First Elementary School, Third Elementary School, Fourth Elementary School, Fifth Elementary School, Seventh Elementary School, Eighth Elementary School, Second Vocational Supplementary School, and various elementary schools, a total of 31 schools and museums. The following decided to continue suspending classes and work: Provincial Male Vocational School, Municipal First Women's Middle School, Provincial Tenth Elementary School, Municipal First Male Middle School, Municipal Sixth Elementary School, Municipal Experimental Museum, Provincial Library, and other 7 schools and museums. The following decided not to stop: Provincial High School, Second Middle School, Second Women's Middle School, Provincial Experimental School, Provincial Female Vocational School, and Sixth Elementary School, a total of 6 schools. At the same time, a declaration rejecting Shen was issued, stating, "Mr. Shen is a person who is good at inciting tides and has no knowledge. Even a three-foot-tall child knows that he is not qualified to be a role model for young people. The public is angry and unanimously rejects him. Unexpectedly, Shen ignored this and shamelessly took office. In order to improve Hubei education and fight for the personality of the education sector, how can we allow Shen to fulfill his personal wishes and occupy an important position? We can only resign entirely, demand the clearing of arrears, in order to preserve our personality and seek justice. Our will is unified, our attitude is bright, heaven and earth can testify, and the facts can prove it. As for the consequences of this resignation, such as the interruption of education and the loss of schooling for young people, Mr. Shen alone should be responsible." The principals of various schools and museums, due to the resignation of all teachers and staff, have no way to carry out their work, so they also convened a meeting and decided to resign to the provincial government. The uproar has become even more difficult to deal with. More than 10,000 middle and elementary school students cannot but declare their abandonment of school. After this incident occurred, the attitudes of various parties were quite noteworthy. Xia Douyin, chairman of the provincial government, on the one hand, respected the central government's orders and maintained Shen's arrival, and on the other hand, tried to find a peaceful solution. He scheduled to convene representatives of teachers and staff to the government on the 21st to talk, and invited provincial committee member Kong Geng and Secretary-General Yang Zaichun to negotiate on behalf of the government, in order to prevent the tide from expanding further. The Pacification Commissioner's Office believed that the teachers and staff rejected Shen and failed to always adopt the procedure of petitioning, and actually issued leaflets, causing social suspicion. During this martial law period, it should be prohibited. On the 20th, it ordered the garrison headquarters to investigate and prohibit them. As for public opinion, newspapers published as much information as possible from both sides, and some also commented on the matter. They could express support for the rejection of Shen, but they believed that it was inappropriate to use the strike as a means, causing more than 10,000 young people to lose their schooling, and called it a suicide policy to promote the education sector's reform.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Recent Situation of the Zhejiang Provincial Library <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Since Chen Xunci was appointed director of the Zhejiang Provincial Library by the Education Department this spring, he has actively reorganized the library's internal affairs. The number of readers and the purchase of new books have greatly increased compared to before. The recent situation of the library's various groups is briefly described below: (1) Reading Group: The two sections of cataloging and lending continue to operate as usual, but there are many improvements in the arrangement compared to before. As for the cataloging work, in addition to dealing with new books, the old books in the library were mostly incompletely cataloged. Now, the library is considering the importance of things and first sorting out the general categories of books (thread-bound books), determining the category numbers, and adding borrowing bags, borrowing slips, and various book cards to facilitate checking. (2) Collection Group: Currently, it is limited to purchasing and receiving donations. There is no transfer of seals yet. Systematic purchasing will also have to wait until the sorting of the old books is completed before it can be used as a basis for making additional purchases. (3) Promotion Group: The main categories are book circulation and guidance. As for the most recent activities: (1) Book Circulation Matters: In addition to managing and improving the book circulation department and the public newspaper and reading center, it is also planned to establish a lending management office and hold book exhibitions, which are currently in progress. (2) Guidance Work: Organizing a guidance committee, conducting correspondence research, and planning to undertake academic lectures as appropriate. The personnel of this group have now set off to various counties and cities in Zhejiang Province to carry out guidance work. (3) Preparing to hold the First District Library Association, which is scheduled to be held at the main library in West Lake on the 22nd of this month. On that day, the president of Zhejiang University, Cheng Tianfang, will also be invited to give a lecture. (4) Editing Group: (1) Compiling and printing a monthly journal with content including academic essays, special reports, book and newspaper abstracts, library news, library affairs, an overview of domestic libraries, correspondence research, etc. Two issues have been published, each priced at one jiao per copy. (2) Revising the Overview, which contains information on all aspects of the library, will be published in the second half of the year. The one-page guide is in the form of a leaflet, with concise descriptions, and is distributed to tourists and visitors. It has been published. Other plans include revising the Rare Book Series and preparing the Zhejiang Journal. (3) Printing House: Reorganized from the old government book bureau, it sells bureau-published books, limited to those printed in-house. In August of the 18th year, a letterpress printing department was added. It now has a letterpress printing department, a book printing department, and a bookstore. The book printing department's storage location is in Zhongzheng Lane, storing 150,000 blocks of editions. The letterpress printing department is in Shuilusi Lane, with two large printing presses and more than 30 workers. Since this spring, business has been more developed than before.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Protecting Educational Administrative Personnel in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Restrictions on Accusers</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, considering that educational administrative personnel bear the significant mission of improving and promoting local education, and that without strict legal protection, capable, proactive, and dedicated individuals are often subject to urging and reorganization, easily incurring blame, which is not as good as those who procrastinate and muddle through, who can remain in their positions for a long time, thereby inevitably discouraging their ambition and affecting their careers, which is extremely serious, has specially formulated measures to protect educational administrative personnel from accusations, and to impose restrictions. (1) Accusations against officials must have reliable guarantors, which has long been clearly stipulated. However, in reality, most of these guarantee letters are forged. For the sake of convenience, henceforth, accusations against educational administrative personnel must, in principle, have guarantors from the provincial capital. Guarantees from county towns and various townships must have formal certificates from local chambers of commerce or village committees to prevent the fraudulent use of letters. (2) If accusations against educational administrative personnel are found to be clearly false accusations, the Department of Education should forward the case to the provincial government, requesting the Higher Court to order local judicial organs to strictly punish the accusers in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3 id="e139">County Education Bureau Issues Order on Measures for Clearing and Supplementing Accumulated Education Expenses <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau yesterday issued instructions to schools at all levels and various social education institutions, stating, "Received Shanghai County Government Instruction No. 293, which forwards Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Instruction No. 439, stating, 'Upon investigation, the method for clearing accumulated debts in various counties was previously formulated by this department in May of the nineteenth year (1930) as the 'Measures for Clearing Accumulated Educational Expenses Before the Eighteenth Year (1929) in Various Counties,' and issued to various counties for compliance. However, in handling this matter, various counties often use the current year's educational revenue solely to repay old debts first, resulting in insufficient funds to maintain the current year's operations and projects, sometimes with a shortfall of seven or eight months. Consequently, old debts are not cleared, and new debts accumulate, and educational staff are solely focused on collecting debts, neglecting their duties, which seriously affects education, which is no minor matter. Moreover, the repaid old debts often lack approved expenditure budgets or departmental orders as a basis, which is particularly inappropriate. Therefore, supplementary measures are further determined as follows: (1) When clearing old debts, each county should clearly delineate the year in which the debt was incurred and should only use the supplemented collection of uncollected educational fees from that year to repay the debt. If the amount of the old debt exceeds the amount that should have been collected but was not, other methods should be used to clear the debt, so as not to hinder the progress of each year's operations. (2) Each county should clear old debts after achieving a certain amount of the supplemented collection of educational fees as stipulated in the preceding article, and issue payments regularly for one year. If full repayment cannot be achieved, it should be amortized over several years, but the current year's revenue should not be diverted to repay the old debts, causing the educational projects being undertaken to become unsustainable. (3) The old debts referred to in the preceding two articles are limited to those listed in the handover of successive education bureau chiefs, which can be verified with the education bureau's revenue and expenditure accounts, approved budgets, or departmental orders. If, after the establishment of the budget, a tight budget or measures for contraction need to be set separately due to disasters, the previously set budget will become ineffective. (4) Within the scope of the preceding article, the county magistrate should supervise the director of the education bureau or the head of the education section to list the old debts in accordance with Article 2 of the 'Measures for Clearing Accumulated Educational Expenses Before the Eighteenth Year (1929) in Various Counties' and submit them for record. Those not within the scope of the preceding article will not be recognized. (5) These supplementary measures apply to arrears and delayed payments incurred after the nineteenth year (1930). In addition to distributing this to various departments, you are hereby instructed to comply, and to instruct the education bureau to comply accordingly. If the current year's funds are diverted to repay old debts or unfounded debts are recklessly recognized and arbitrarily issued, both the county magistrate and the education bureau director shall be held responsible.'"</p>
<h3 id="e140">Record of Striking the Bell in an Ancient Temple (3) The Reclusive Monk Does Not Remove the Weeds in the Courtyard <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>

<p>How can I not be sad? The people who were awakened by my bell to farm and work are now, in broad daylight, either joyfully "eating lunch" or frowning with worry, "having no food to eat." Thinking of this, even my hands are trembling. How can I have the strength to strike this sorrowful bell again? However, I don't have the courage to resign from the monastery and strike the bell, because if I don't strike the bell, I won't have anything to eat. Strike it then! Heartlessly strike it! From now on, the sound of the bell I strike will no longer represent the cheers of those who have food to eat, but the sighs of those who have no food to eat.</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>I shouldn't have made my words too long. Since the bell must be struck, I have no choice but to study the method of striking it. The noon bell on a sunny day seems to be able to be struck accurately, but what about cloudy days? What about at night? These are indeed troubling questions for me.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I heard that ancient people used clepsydras to tell time. One day, seeing the water dripping from the eaves during the rain, I wanted to try to make a clepsydra using this principle. Soon, I had considerable success. I made a cylindrical vessel, filled it with water, and opened a small hole at the bottom, allowing the water to drip down drop by drop. The vessel was twenty-four inches high, representing twenty-four hours. Each inch was equally divided into two, representing forty-eight hours. It could be used for two days and two nights. The first time, I had to align the sun's shadow with the noon line before letting the water start dripping. When it dripped to about twelve inches, it would be noon the next day, and when it dripped to the last drop, it would be noon the day after. It could be used on cloudy days and at night. However, it was not easy to accurately tell time with this thing. When the water level was high, the pressure was high and it dripped quickly. When the water level was low, the pressure was low and it dripped slowly. Dry or humid weather affected its speed. At first, I completely trusted it and was often misled by it. Only if it was manufactured skillfully and used cleverly could it provide some assistance. This was only possible after repeated trials and verifications. But the most accurate clock at night was not the water in the vessel, but the stars in the sky. Usually, I relied on the movement of the constellations in the sky to strike my evening bell and my morning bell.</p>
<p>Redemption, etc. Therefore, I hereby instruct the said bureau director to follow this instruction, etc., and order compliance.</p>

Various military and political authorities have repeatedly presented commemorative awards. According to news from the rear office of the corps, the Nanjing Boy Scout Headquarters also sent a telegram, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, expressing sincere commendation. The original text is recorded as follows: "To the Boy Scout Council and all members of the Battlefield Service Corps: During the Shanghai Incident, which caused devastation in Shanghai, the council voluntarily organized a Battlefield Service Corps, disregarding difficulties and dangers, and worked for several months. Disaster victims relied on it for relief, and the military relied on it for assistance.

He has now returned to Shanghai from the United States and has already written a large book, "Record of German Railway Investigation." The observations are accurate, and the content is rich. It covers all aspects of Germany's latest railway management, rolling stock, engineering, machinery, accounting, and data collection in detail, with over a hundred tables and over fifty exquisite illustrations. An appendix, "World Transportation," provides a detailed overview of transportation in various countries. It can serve as a compass for China's future railway industry. The book has already been published, priced at one dollar and fifty cents in paperback, and is managed by the Shanghai Life Weekly Society, the Youth Association Bookstore, and major bookstores such as Xinyue and Kaiming.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Forgetting What One Has Read Is the Most Painful Thing in Life <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Lai Bei</p>
<p>Reading foreign books involves nothing more than reasoning and narration. In fact, speeches also involve reasoning and narration. The so-called "Belle Oration" also aims to convey meanings clearly, express rich emotions and profound thoughts, move people, and persuade them to do good. Actors in plays only make people relieve boredom and laugh. The popular speeches nowadays also only aim to win applause and cheers from the audience, which is not that different from acting. They do not prompt people to think deeply, nor do they inspire people to sing or weep, which is a great loss to the meaning of speeches.</p>
<p>The best Chinese book for narration is Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian." My teacher, Chao Deli, once said, "Even foreign countries cannot match the writing style of Sima Qian. The writing style of the 'Records of the Grand Historian' is concise, clear, and transparent. He uses just a few words to describe historical facts, which can be regarded as the essence of narration."</p>
<p>Reading Chinese books focuses on recitation, so many people can cite classical allusions from memory. In the past, there was a Sun Dengshan, a Hanlin official from Zhejiang, who was a favorite disciple of Zhang Xiangtao (Zi Dong). His memory was truly good, and he could recite the Thirteen Classics from beginning to end, which was truly not easy, and I admire him greatly for this. Strangely, after reading many books, one sometimes forgets everything completely, and sometimes only some shadows remain. In fact, foreign languages and Chinese languages seem to be two different things. Sometimes, after reading many foreign books, when one wants to pick up a pen and write some Chinese characters, one cannot even recall the sentences. I suffer greatly. When outsiders come to ask me to write inscriptions or compose poems, I have to rack my brains and strain my blood, because my brain is as empty as a drawer. I have to pull them out one by one and search for traces in the books that I have forgotten completely. (Han's note: Old Master Xiang is modest and magnanimous. In fact, his memory is very strong, and he can often point out the mysteries and contradictions in the words of the ancients.)</p>
<p>In my opinion, forgetting what one has read is the most painful thing in life.</p>
<p>Yesterday's title, "Settled in a Careless Manner" (活囫圇了結), was a mistake for "Swallowing the Date Whole" (囫圇呑了結). This is a correction.</p>
<h3 id="e147">A Record of Taking Over the Dead Market of Jiangwan <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua</p>
<p>On the morning of May 19th at 8:00 AM, government personnel and news reporters gathered at the Joint Association, ready to depart and take over Jiangwan, west of Songhu Road. The passes stated that only 18 people were allowed. The reporters found no room to squeeze in and looked at each other in dismay. Jin Xiongbai arrived the latest and was caught off guard, looking the most anxious. Xu Xinyi arrived the earliest and had already made contact, appearing the most calm. The rest were discussing animatedly, some suggesting retreat and others suggesting a charge. No one could reach a consensus. In the end, they all went together, with Ma Chonggan's car leading the way. Each car had to follow closely so as not to get lost and overcome the difficulties of being questioned along the way. Unexpectedly, my car was particularly slow, and the driver was not skilled. As a result, we fell behind. Jiang Hongjiao and Zhang Youde were afraid of getting lost and not receiving news, so they were extremely anxious and urged the driver to step on the gas. However, the driver was covered in sweat and nothing helped. Near the New World, a red light flashed, and the car in front sped past, losing sight of us. Thus, we could not see those who had gone before nor those who would come after, and the car wandered alone. Everyone was scratching their heads anxiously, blaming Zhang San and complaining about Li Si. Fortunately, Mr. Ma's car was waiting at Hongkou Park, and everyone finally felt relieved.</p>
<p>Jiangwan covers an area of ninety square li and four fen, with six thousand one hundred and four households and more than seven thousand one hundred houses. Now, nineteen out of ten are destroyed. The number of households with family losses that have been registered has reached two thousand six hundred and fourteen. The main street with department stores has become a scorched earth. No houses survived. Jiangwan, which was previously regarded as a scenic area with a rich Western European Swiss flavor, is now like a dead city in Belgium after the war, with no trace of human habitation. Japanese soldiers were constantly marching along the way, often showing murderous faces. The Labor University was riddled with bullet holes. In front of the broken wall was a Japanese gun rack with guns and bullets. Mr. Zhou stood beside it, and the reporters competed to take pictures. Who knew that two Japanese officers would suddenly get out of the car, brandishing their power. A large number of cameras were almost in danger. Mr. Li, a reporter for the Continental Daily, was quick-witted and captured a shot. This photo is worth more than usual.</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM, representatives from both sides and neutral countries held a handover ceremony at the Cultural College Japanese Headquarters and signed the handover document. The Japanese representative, Akazawa, shook hands with our side's Dai, Liang, and Li committee members and drank champagne to say goodbye. Alas, since Chinese territory has not been transferred, how can there be a takeover? Nothing in the world is more ridiculous. At 12:00 PM, Dr. Fei Kunian and I hired a car to go north of the town, intending to delve into the interior and pay tribute to the traces of war. Along the way, the birds were crying and the flowers were falling, and the water was green and the wind was clear, which made one feel "the country still stands, but in the spring, the city is overgrown." I saw the Keyi Village Municipal School. The janitor said that the school had been occupied by the Japanese army. On the 18th, before leaving, they took away a sandbox designed to resist Japan. It was expected that its return would provoke the Chinese people. The classics were gone, and the tables, chairs, and organs had disappeared. The fences were completely removed, and the glass windows were completely shattered. The lush grass in the playground was like the hair of prisoners, overgrown and messy, making it impossible to step on. Reflecting on the past and thinking about the present, I couldn't help but shed tears. I went west again to Xitang Village, but I saw that all the houses had been almost completely destroyed by Japanese planes. What met the eye was nothing but ruins and rubble. The villagers, carrying their young and leading their women, were building thatched huts, like swallows carrying mud in spring, working hard in every way. Their faces all reflected the tragedy in their hearts. They did not know where the tears would come from. The Municipal Tao Bay Elementary School was also buried among them. The painstaking creation was hit with disaster in a single day. The cruelty of destroying culture was worse than the burning of books by Qin Shi Huang. This is truly a fatal wound to our nation.</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, the president of the Examination Yuan of the National Government, was beaten and insulted by students while giving a speech in the wartime capital of Xi'an… The newspapers have been reporting this incident for the past few days. These young people dare to despise party discipline and insult the "elders of the party," which is tantamount to destroying the "dignity and sanctity of the party." In fact, whether the party is worthy of "dignity and sanctity" is another question, but let's talk about the "elders of the party."</p>
<p>There is always a so-called "elder faction" in any country's political party. Our country's Kuomintang is no exception, and there is more than one elder. I remember that in recent years, every time a party struggle led to a civil war, the elders would run around to all sides, trying to mediate and reconcile, exhausting their ability to quell the unrest. However, the result was still inevitably a "war." Due to the worsening situation, it was difficult for them to be elders! Since the outbreak of the September 18th National Crisis until now, the government has been sitting idly by, allowing the country to be ceded and rights lost. In the absence of any way to deal with the situation, the "elders of the party" have been enduring the pain and enjoying themselves, and not a single one has been willing to speak out righteously and resolve the national crisis! Apart from the patriotic people who do not forget their "ownership" status and cry out in pain, almost no one is advising the government. Hey! "Elders of the party," both internally and externally, are like this, so what else is there to say? Therefore, Dai's humiliation was a normal reaction. What is so rare about it?</p>
<h3 id="e149">A Misunderstanding About Qiyakou <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Yanzi</p>
<p>Liuhe, Yanglinkou, and Qiyakou are all important fortresses along the Yangtze River. During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, when Japanese pirates invaded, Fengxian and Nanhui along the coast (at that time, Fengxian was under the jurisdiction of Lou County and Nanhui was under the jurisdiction of Shanghai, and the counties had not yet been separated) and Taicang and Changshu along the river were all areas ravaged by Japanese pirates. The court ordered Qi Jiguang to lead his troops to suppress the pirates and stationed a large army at Huijiao. Beacon towers were set up along the line, reaching all the way to Hangzhou, totaling one hundred and fifty-three towers. The three towers in Nanhui still exist at the old site. Whenever a Japanese warship docked, a fire would be lit as a signal to communicate military intelligence. In the Huangdu area of Taicang, Japanese pirates entered by surprise and carried out a very tragic massacre (according to research, the only people who can be called true Huangdu people today are the Zhang, Jin, Wang, and Wan families). The villagers fled to the four townships of Zhangyan and Qinglong Temple. The Japanese pirates followed and arrived. The Weituo deity enshrined in Qinglong Temple manifested himself in the clouds and scared away the Japanese pirates. At that time, Qi Jiguang heard the alarm and led his entire fleet into the river mouth, surrounding and suppressing the pirates on all sides. All the Japanese pirates were wiped out. People praised his merits and named the place "Lord Qi's Mouth." Over time, it was distorted and mistakenly called Qiyakou, which is a great loss to the ancient people's intention of commemorating and admiring the meritorious deeds. This is recorded for those who are familiar with geography to consult.</p>
<p>Editor's note: During this Japanese invasion, the people of Huangdu all fled to Zhangyan and were fortunate enough to be spared. Therefore, the incense offering at Qinglong Temple on March 15th was extremely grand, which was also due to this reason.</p>
<p>Anecdotes from the Old Capital</p>
<h3 id="e150">Camel Bells <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu An</p>
<p>In the past, the capital officials would jocularly compare camels to Hanlin officials, saying that they were similar in their high view and slow pace. They also said that their entangled networks could obstruct passersby, similar to the Hanlin officials forming factions and providing assistance. This saying probably already existed in the Ming Dynasty. The camel is a thing that, during the harsh winter weather, has the ability to shoulder heavy responsibilities and go far. Its huge body and thick, soft fur give it a kind and approachable air. It is truly a sacred animal of the north. All those who transport coal must use this animal. From the Western Hills to the city, one often encounters them day and night in the autumn and winter seasons. About ten camels form a team, their noses pierced with rope and connected continuously. The last camel has a large bell hanging from its neck, so the person leading the way can know that the camel is safe by listening to the sound of the bell, without having to care for it. The sound is deep, turbid, and slow, and whenever the frost is clear and the wind is tight, it is like a call and response, which makes people feel as if they are hearing an ancient song of leaving the border. If one encounters camel bells and then hears the sound of a car horn, then the new and the old, the fast and the slow, show the difference in the era and the great distance. In my opinion, the camel bell can represent the national character of the north, and the camel team and the car traveling side by side on the road are enough to represent the mixed composition of the new and old cultures of the northern capital, traveling side by side without conflicting. By April and May, the camel's hair falls off, revealing its skin, and it becomes emaciated and bony, making it look particularly miserable. They are gradually rarely seen in the market, and when it gets hotter, they cannot go out. Once the autumn wind blows a little harder, new hair grows, and they quickly regain a warm and revitalized appearance. Therefore, this thing cannot only not cross the river, but it cannot even be transported between Zhao and Wei. Its nature is unique. They usually carry coal in sacks, and the hands, feet, and faces of the people leading the camels are all stained with coal, which is called coal black.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Opium to Save the Nation? <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident in the East Province and the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the enemy's artillery fire has continuously attacked our country, and everyone has been shouting about saving the nation… creating a smoky atmosphere! The ways to save the nation are different. Some are playing dancing to save the nation? Some are playing mahjong to save the nation? Playing games to save the nation? Now, they are going a step further and simply using opium to save the nation; according to reports: "The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association is using all its efforts to protest against the fact that all provinces in the north and south have already implemented the public sale of opium. It is now heard that the central government is carrying out the public sale plan for the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Wu Liande has repeatedly traveled to Beijing and Shanghai to work for this matter."</p>
<p>Late at night, the lights are dim, puffing smoke, lying on a couch, this shackle of the smoke screen, is this saving the nation? Is this destroying the race? Alas! Hateful! Alas! Painful!</p>

<p>— Master of the Hall of Seeking Happiness</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Boundless Sorrow and Resentment in Confession, Difficult to Expect Open-mindedness; Utmost Song and Dance, Revelry Reveal Authority and Dignity</p>
<p>It is said that Liang Xiaoyun returned home and saw Wei Zhuomou already sitting in the study with An Yutian. He said that Li Wenxia had a reply letter and entrusted Wei Zhuomou to bring it. He was anxious to get the letter to read. Wei Zhuomou casually picked up a page of stationery from the coffee table, unfolded it, and said, "What's written on it is very simple. Yutian has already read it just now. I might as well recite it to you once. There are many unfinished words below. Li Wenxia asked me to convey them orally on her behalf." There were only a few lines scribbled on the letter, only a hundred or so words, very much like a casual note. It said, "I have read your letter. The previous agreement suddenly changed. At first, I was inevitably surprised. Then I thought that you were forced by the situation and could eventually be understood. Since I am of no benefit to you, I should not stand in the way and delay your future. Now I have nothing else to say but to retreat. The previous agreement is naturally cancelled, without any objection. A check is returned herewith. The remaining sentiments are entrusted to Mr. Wei to convey in person. I wish Mr. Yutian and Ms. Xiaoyun a happy marriage." Judging from these few words on the surface alone, this Ms. Li can indeed be said to be the most capable of being open-minded. But it's not that I, Lao Wei, am boasting. In reality, it was still thanks to my eloquence that I persuaded her. At first, when she went to the apartment and received the letter Yutian wrote to her from the tea boy, she was simply filled with anger. Several times she wanted to come to your door and question Yutian alone. Even when I first went to see her, she was crying and making a fuss at me, talking about legal solutions and newspaper questioning. After I used my three-inch tongue to explain to her in detail, I said that the established situation in the world could not be changed, and the ever-changing love in mankind could not be forced. Yutian's new union is related to Yutian's current personal interests. If you truly love Yutian, you should understand Yutian's difficulties. If you simply act on impulse, you will only hurt your feelings, and in the end, you will not be able to reunite. Or even if you can reunite, it will still be of no benefit to each other. You cannot solve the current difficulties, and it is also difficult to maintain it for a long time. Then why bother doing it? Fortunately, she is indeed extremely intelligent. After thinking about my famous words that contained great philosophy, she suddenly woke up and voluntarily tried her best to be a great benevolent and brave sacrifice in the field of love. But she also asked me to say a few words on her behalf. No matter how Yutian treats her, she still loves Yutian very much. In addition to sincerely praying for your happiness in everything, she is determined to go her own way and vows to use her single life to commemorate her past dreamlike love with Yutian. And in order to maintain her independent personality, she will strive on her own from now on. She does not want to rely on anyone. Therefore, she has to return your check in order to avoid the suspicion of using money to buy love. After she has made some achievements in the future, she can also勉徇 Xiaoyun's kindness and maintain a considerable friendship with each other. But it's not possible to talk about this for a while. Please forgive you two."</p>

<h3 id="e155">Last Week's Gold Price First Fell and Then Rebounded <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Once Passed the 700 Taels Mark on Tuesday</p>
<p>The Fluctuations Were Extremely Dramatic Throughout the Week The changes in the gold price last week were even more dramatic, with a difference of more than ten taels per day. Industry players were at a loss, and major households' inflows and outflows took different paths. At the beginning of the week, the assassination of the Japanese Prime Minister caused a sudden drop, once breaking the 700 taels mark, suddenly reaching 687 taels and 5 mace. Subsequently, overseas silver markets reported declines, and the Shanghai exchange rate rebounded, leading to a surge above 720 taels. By Friday, it had reached 730 taels and 2 mace, with a cumulative increase of more than 40 taels. Finally, it slightly weakened, falling sharply by 10 taels, and ended at 719 taels and 2 mace. Considering the high and low points of these five days, there was a difference of 42 taels and 7 mace. Compared to the previous Saturday (the first day of trading in July), it still rose by 4 taels and 2 mace. However, the fluctuations were confusing, and people were flustered, with prices fluctuating constantly. The British and American silver markets contracted again, but the exchange rate had rebounded by 1.75 to 1.875 points. With this, the forward exchange rate became even tighter, with both official and unofficial rates contracting by one notch. The US dollar also slightly contracted by 0.25. Gold industry players and speculators had already sold off. The US dollar occasionally had returned notes. From the beginning of the week, it opened at 42-43 taels, and later only counted 38-39 taels. However, the Chinese merchants roughly sold short 5-6 million yuan, calculated at a listed price of over 70 taels. As for the thin inventory of physical goods, it was necessary to add 11 taels to the spot price. However, there may still be twists and turns in the future, making it difficult to predict. The general situation of the week is summarized below.</p>
<h3 id="e156">The Result Was a Rebound of Four Taels and Two Mace <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>

(Tuesday) The big silver bar had no telegraphic transfer, the US silver bar increased wildly by 0.625, the forward exchange rate increased sharply by two notches, calculated at half a penny, and the US dollar also increased by 0.75. The domestic market was also trending towards loosening.

Afterwards, the exchange market turned flat, and all parties were entering, rebounding by more than 10 taels, to 99 taels and 3 mace. The midday close was 97 taels and 7 mace.

After 4 o'clock, it retreated to 96 taels and 2 mace, and then closed at 698 taels, a sharp drop of 17 taels compared to the previous Saturday.

Afterwards, it advanced all the way, mainly because the exchange market was strong, and the buyers were brave. General short positions quickly covered, soaring by more than 10 taels. At noon, it was 20 taels and 0.01 mace, and at the close, it was 18 taels and 2 mace. The market opened at 16 taels in the afternoon. Hengyu and others sold according to the listed price. Subsequently, because the forward exchange rate contracted even more, major households pursued purchases, and it suddenly rose by 6-7 taels, to 22 taels and 6 mace. Due to the active sellers, and rumors of a mobilization order in Soviet Russia, it immediately rose to 18 taels and 3 mace, reaching 19 taels and a half at the close, a sharp increase of 17 taels and 7 mace compared to the previous day. There was a review of 16 taels throughout the day. The Ningbo gang released, while Hengyu Fuxing Yongruixing and others entered. Friday The big silver bar telegraphed that it contracted again by 0.25 and the US silver bar contracted by 0.375. The forward exchange rate did not change, and the internal market was quite flat.

The market made exchange drafts of more than 260,000 in the early market and 225,000 in the noon market. There were no transactions in banknotes. The total value of discount tickets traded in both markets was slightly below 2 million. Small Qianzhuang made more than 400,000 in transactions. The Jiangnan small foreign exchange rate in both markets was still 6 qian 0.01, with only 3,000 jiao traded in the early market. The Guangdong small foreign exchange rate was 6 qian 0.005 li in the early market and 5 qian 9 fen 0.0095 li in the noon market, with 140,000 jiao traded in the early market and 75,000 jiao traded in the noon market. Copper coins increased by 500 wen, to 421,000 wen, opening a special high price again.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Last Week's Securities Market Remained Calm <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>During the past week (from May 16 to May 21), the spot market conditions of various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were clearer than the previous week. Only 160,000 yuan of futures were opened for the whole week, and the market atmosphere on both the buying and selling sides felt slightly more active than before. Among them, bonds such as the 20 customs consolidation salt tax were not lonely in terms of inflows and outflows. Especially compared to the past, the difference is very far. It was found that the total turnover for the whole week was only slightly over 1 million on Monday, about 2 million on the weekend, and between 2.56 million and 3 million on the remaining days. The total turnover was 14.58 million yuan, exceeding the previous week by 4.5 million yuan. Among them, the consolidated salt tax was the largest, accounting for 2.505 million yuan, the consolidated tax was 2.395 million yuan, the 20 customs scroll each accounted for about 1.95 million yuan, the troop reduction was 1.68 million yuan, the 19 good was 1.47 million yuan, the 19 customs was 1.38 million yuan, the reorganization was 680,000 yuan, and the customs tax was 400,500 yuan. The whole six and nine six only opened in the May period, the whole six only 115,000 yuan, the nine six only 50,000 yuan, and the financial market was deserted. As for the trend of various bond markets in the past week, its stable situation was more obvious than the previous week. The whole week was trapped in a fluctuating state, without major ups and downs. The intraday rise was only 0.056 to 1 yuan or so on Tuesday, and the ups and downs on the remaining days were very slight. The situation was even worse on the weekend, and the prices of each bond hardly changed. It was because at the beginning of the week, due to the assassination of the Japanese Prime Minister, the Japanese political situation suddenly changed, and news came from our south that there would be military action, which made the market atmosphere weaker than before. The selling transactions were slightly more active for a while, with supply exceeding demand. Then, the situation stabilized slightly, and the price returned to firmness. Subsequently, it fell into a stable state. As a result, there were mutual ups and downs compared to the previous week, and the fluctuations were not significant. In addition to the troop reduction, 19 good, 20 scroll and other spot goods and the average of the 20 customs June period, the remaining only had a few angles to half a yuan of change. Observing the situation of the bond market, in terms of the current environmental situation, if there is no new development in the current situation and diplomacy, it will be difficult to have major ups and downs for the time being. It is estimated that continuing to rise is unlikely in the current environment, because if the price rises too high, it will inevitably lead to the sale of those with goods. However, it seems that it is not going to turn lower for the time being. If the price falls too much, not only will it be difficult for all parties to maintain, but there will also be no shortage of purchasers with generous profits. Therefore, in the near future, the bond market will temporarily maintain a fluctuating state, and it is feared that there will be no major ups and downs. The high and low fluctuations of the prices of various bonds in the past week are listed in the following table (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3 id="e159">Cotton Yarn Last Week's Yarn Market Became Weak Again <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was extremely sluggish last week, and the trend suddenly turned weak. The actual demand was very quiet. The reasons for this are: (1) In the middle of the previous week, various gangs purchased about 30,000 to 40,000 bales. It was found that the procurement in the South China port was the largest. Now, due to the unresolved political disputes in Guangdong Province, and the relationship of settling accounts at the end of May, the impact is also huge. (2) The scourge of Fujian and Jiangxi is rampant, and the banditry in Henan and Hubei is severe. The domestic economy is tight and it is still difficult to restore the previous relaxed state. (3) The North China area has long been occupied by Japanese yarn, and there is very little hope for Chinese yarn. With all these unfavorable situations, the yarn market is still in a sad state. Fortunately, the inventory of various factories is thinner than before, so the current attitude of manufacturers is very stable. However, according to the world cotton industry situation, it is still in a state of weakness and depression. It was found that the price of 20-count yarn in a certain country is 127 yuan, and the calculated price in Shanghai is only about 140 taels. Therefore, the Japanese factories in China are making rapid progress and working very hard. The competition for native yarn is particularly fierce, and the future is even more worrying. Therefore, it is best for Chinese yarn to find ways to sell as much as possible, so as to easily囤货. According to a part of the cloud, there is hope for improvement in customer sales after the Dragon Boat Festival. It was found that only 2,047 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the week, of which 300 bales were from the same industry, a decrease of 27,378 bales compared with the previous week. The marked yarn market on the exchange was very sluggish. Because of the lack of operators, the opening time every day was very short, and the ups and downs were also slight. At the end of the week, a part of it fell due to the low original price and the unfavorable surrounding environment. The total turnover for the whole week was only 26,600 bales, and the price fell by 2.34 taels compared with the previous week. The price of 20-count medium yarn for spot yarn fell by 3 taels compared to the previous week. The number of bales purchased by each gang is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Last Week's Cotton Market Lacked Vitality <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Cotton factories were greatly disappointed last week, and consumption was almost non-existent. This was because the factories purchased too much foreign cotton last year, resulting in a great lack of sales of local cotton. It was found that the stock of American and Indian cotton in various Shanghai warehouses reached 130,000 to 40,000 pieces, about 500,000 dan, and recently, the factories still purchased some because the price was relatively low. The Shenxin Factory imported Lumite cotton at a price of only 28.05 taels, 5,700 pieces. Under this situation, it is very difficult for the cotton market to rise. However, according to the American cotton situation, it is still brewing. It was found that the report on the reduction of cotton fields is still small, and the weather for new cotton is smooth. The consumption of yarn mills has not improved, and the cloth market is not prosperous. All kinds of situations are still flat and tired. Therefore, there is a lack of vitality, and the transaction of標花 is very rare, and the rise and fall are also slight. The price of標棉 in each month fell by 2.5 qian compared to last week. The total turnover for the whole week was only 46,000 dan. The price of American cotton rose by 20磅音 compared to last week. The prices of spot cotton purchased by various factories are listed below.</p>

<p>Last week, 31,839 boxes of red tea from Qining and other roads, and green tea from Luzhuang and Tuzhuang and other roads arrived. The source of new goods was quite strong. However, for Qimen red tea, Chinese tea merchants were reluctant because the tea prices in the production area were high and the cost was huge. British tea merchants also insisted on tightening their attitude because the British government doubled the import tax on Chinese tea and the first payment was 30% higher than the old one. The two sides have been at a stalemate for four days. Finally, De Shang Xingcheng 洋行 opened at 210 taels. On Friday and Saturday, Yihe, Tianyu, Dudedetianxiang and other firms continued to carry out more than 3,200 boxes. Although the selling price was tens to hundreds of taels lower than last year, the transaction was not lonely. In the future, the Qicha market must wait for the Chinese merchants to insist on transferring their strength. As for the green tea such as Zhenmei and Zhenmei on various roads, 3,760 boxes were traded throughout the week, and the route was also quite prosperous. However, the selling price fell by 30 to 40 taels, and the chaos of the market price has reached its extreme. Recently, the Moroccan market in France has been ordering many excellent Zhenmei by telegram, but major firms, in view of the Chinese merchants' rapid price reduction, mostly take a wait-and-see attitude to wait for the opportunity. If the market stabilizes in the future, the route of green tea may have a major breakthrough.</p>

Changxi Beigeng Xiangzhuang Gang and the local city store Wei were very good, and the selling price was also 5 points hard. The four types of goods, Tongbian Yinhua, Yangjian, and Lujian, were in short supply and the retail market was in a stable state.</p>
<p>North City Yesterday, twenty or thirty white粳 from Suzhou, Changzhou, and Jiangyin arrived. The customer lifted the price of Heji's goods, such as Changzhou Yixing, and other prices combined with Shanghai exceeded the corner. Due to the weather, the market has improved. Still, 3 ships of Xitang Fengjing rice arrived, and the route was not good, and the asking price dropped.</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The Shanghai postal workers' "Save the Post Office" movement, which had been brewing for a long time, suddenly announced a general strike again yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Because the association proposed a plan to consolidate the postal base, but the Ministry had no sincere intention of accepting it, a general strike was declared starting on the morning of the 22nd. The four conditions put forward by the association are also justifiable and legitimate demands.</p>
<p>Because the government is economically exhausted (why it is exhausted, let's not discuss for the moment), it may be possible to adjust surpluses to offset deficits, and use long to compensate for short. However, the government's use of funds has never been made public, and the people have no right to question it. Ordinary people only see certain dignitaries spending hundreds of thousands to buy foreign houses as residences, and certain dignitaries spending millions to buy villas. The country supports countless useless dignitaries and politicians. Apart from these, there are no benefits to the country or the people to be seen.</p>
<p>The people can only envy, only sigh, only provide their hard-earned money one by one. Please, dignitaries, put yourself in our place and think, isn't this unfair?</p>

<p>A scene of devastation fills the eyes, brimming with tears.</p>
<p>Settle peacefully in your old homes and till your lands,</p>

<h3 id="e168">Scientific Luminescent Materials <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Lisheng</p>
<p>Materials that continue to emit light in a dark room after exposure to light are mostly alkaline earth metal sulfides. If appropriate compounds are added to these sulfides, luminescent materials of various colors such as red, green, purple, and blue can be produced. The hands and numerals on some watches that can be seen even in the dark are an example of the industrial application of luminescent materials. There are various methods for making them. A few simple ones are introduced below:</p>
<p>(1) Purple Luminescent Material: 20.0 grams of lime or oyster shell ash powder, 6.0 grams of sulfur powder, and 2.0 grams of starch are finely ground and mixed evenly. Then, drip in a solution of 0.5 grams of bismuth nitrate Bi(NO3)5 dissolved in 100 ml of alcohol and a small amount of hydrochloric acid. Place in a fire-resistant container and heat until red-hot for 20 minutes. After cooling, grind into a fine powder and heat again for 15 minutes, but be careful not to overheat and cause it to melt.</p>
<p>(2) Dark Blue Luminescent Material: 20.0 grams of lime, 20.0 grams of barium hydroxide Ba(OH)2, 6.0 grams of sulfur, 1.0 gram each of potassium sulfate K2SO4 and sodium sulfate Na2SO4, 2.0 grams of lithium carbonate Li2Co3, and 2 ml of bismuth nitrate solution (concentration as in the first method), and 2 ml of rubidium nitrate RbNo3 solution (concentration is a ratio of one to one hundred parts water). After mixing well, heat as in the previous method to produce the material.</p>
<p>(3) White Luminescent Material: 0.4 grams of bismuth nitrate, 2.5 grams of table salt, 62.0 grams of sulfur flowers, 65.0 grams of strontium carbonate SrCo3, and 4.0 grams of crystalline sodium carbonate Na2Co3roH2O are mixed and placed in a fire-resistant container, covered with a layer of starch. Heat until red-hot for five minutes, then remove. The white luminescent material is then ready.</p>
<p>(4) Pale Red Luminescent Material: 100.0 grams of oyster shell ash and 25 grams of calcined sea salt powder are mixed with 60.0 to 100.0 grams of sulfur flowers. Place in a fire-resistant container and heat until red-hot. Then add 20.0 grams of strontium sulfide SrS and heat again. After cooling, a pale red luminescent powder is obtained. If strontium sulfide is replaced with barium sulfide BaS, a green luminescent material is obtained. Note: This material should be stored in a glass bottle in a dark place.</p>
<p>(5) Watch Face Luminescent Material: Take zinc sulfide precipitate ZnS and place it in a fire-resistant container, sealing the opening. Heat to white-hot, then add a small amount of copper, lead, or silver (any will do), and mix evenly. Take mesothorium bromide equal to one-thousandth of the weight of the zinc sulfide, dissolve it in water, and drip this solution into the fire-resistant container containing the zinc sulfide, which has been cooled to below 100 degrees. Place the container in a hot water bath and heat until dry. Grind the powder, mix with Canada balsam and a small amount of xylene, and it is ready for use.</p>
<p>(6) By adding thallsnitraf solution to 6.0 grams of sulfur, 40.0 grams of strontium carbonate, 1.0 gram of lithium carbonate, and 1.0 gram of arsenic sulfide As2S3, a light green color can be produced. Other colors such as yellow and ocher can also be produced, but due to length limitations, they are omitted.</p>

<p>— Hongshui</p>
<p>Wu Ma had a boil on her breast, and she had no choice but to find every possible way to get medical treatment.</p>
<p>In a corner of the ×× ward, she sat on the sofa, holding her chest with both hands from time to time, crying out in pain, waiting for the doctor to hurry up and examine her. A young doctor in a Western suit was carefully treating a modern girl. From this soft and gentle breeze, a fragrant scent drifted, mixed with her moans of discomfort.</p>
<p>"Dr. ×, please be kind!" Wu Ma said, almost crying from the pain.</p>
<p>But he only glanced at her, and in the corner of his eye, he showed a look of disgust for Wu Ma, who was wearing a blue jacket and black pants, and was both yellow and thin.</p>
<p>"Hey! Dr. ×… It hurts so much!" Wu Ma seemed to want to get angry, seeing that he was always chatting with that lady about things that had nothing to do with the illness.</p>
<p>"Don't be noisy, don't be noisy! When did it start?" he asked coldly.</p>
<p>"Five days!"</p>
<p>"How are your bowel movements and urination? Any fever?"</p>
<p>"...Yes..."</p>
<p>"Hmm! It's because of internal heat!" he said, shaking his head twice.</p>
<p>"Oh dear! Is it dangerous?" she asked anxiously, frowning tightly.</p>
<p>"What's called dangerous? If you say it's dangerous, it's not dangerous, but if you say it's not dangerous, it might be dangerous!"</p>
<p>"What should I do? Dr. ×!"</p>
<p>"It will cost nine dollars…"</p>
<p>"Okay… okay… Can you make it stronger?"</p>
<p>"Haha, just prescribing this ××× medicine will cost at least five dollars."</p>
<p>"…" Only Wu Ma's eyes narrowed, and a few tears fell. He still thought she was just in too much pain, so he turned to an old lady with a round face, smiling and starting his diagnosis.</p>

<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>Human life is unequal, but the inequality caused by humans is even more severe than natural inequality. Needless to say, the leisurely lives of the madams and young ladies in mansions; when the dance hostesses finish their night of selling smiles, in the faint light of dawn, sleepy-eyed, when they return home, it is exactly the time when the female workers in the silk factory, with their lunch boxes, go to work in the silk factory. And there is an absolute difference between the lives of female workers and dance hostesses. In the eyes of ordinary female workers, the life of a dance hostess seems like a goddess descending to earth.</p>
<p>Because behind our school, there are three or four silk factories, so I have quite a bit of insight into the lives of the female workers. When the east turns the color of fish belly, while we are fast asleep, the noisy sounds from the back break our good night's sleep every day. They start working at six o'clock. Those who live far away have to get up at three or four o'clock to cook.</p>
<p>After they enter the silk factory, they don't get off work until six o'clock in the afternoon. Except for a little bit of lunch time, they have to work eleven hours a day, gathering wealth for the factory owners like cattle and horses. Their lives are, of course, extremely hard, but in their own eyes, they don't feel any pain. They pass the days happily, because when they are working, the factory staff often tease and joke with them, and their mouths are also very practiced. They can answer men fluently with both romantic and obscene words. In their eyes, this may be comfort found in hardship!</p>
<p>The liveliest time is of course when they get off work. In the morning, when they go to work, they enter the factory in scattered groups, but when they get off work, they come out together. At that time, because of the day's labor, they are happy to go home to rest, and their faces are filled with smiles. They excitedly carry their lunch baskets out. This forms a perfect inverse proportion to the listless and dispirited attitude when they go to work. "Zhao Di!" "Lin Di!" "Gen Di!" "Zhao Di's mother!" "Lin Di's older sister!" A lively sound fills the air of the streets.</p>
<p>The idle, good-for-nothing, and frivolous young men, from experience, already know the time when the silk factory gets off work. Before six o'clock, they will gather at the entrance of the silk factory as if by agreement, waiting for these female workers to come out. The older women, of course, can be safe and sound, but the younger, more fashionable female workers, when they come out three together or two in a group, are inevitably surrounded and teased at will. Some of them run away like small birds seeing hungry eagles, while others curse and laugh, calling them "rotten corpses" and "rascals." But when they are cursed, they not only don't get angry, but instead show smiles, as if hoping that they will curse a few more times, thinking that they have achieved a considerable victory.</p>
<p>Among them, there are also some who ride bicycles, intentionally going very slowly, to block their way. Wherever they go, the bicycles follow. These things, except on days when work is stopped, are found around our school every day.</p>
<h3 id="e171">A Street Test of Business Acumen, Part One <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Time Spent Gazing at Store Windows</p>
<p>Recently, competition among stores has become increasingly fierce. As a result, merchants have made amazing progress in the study of window displays. In prosperous cities and busy streets, we feel that the items displayed in the store windows on both sides are constantly changing with competitive designs, novel patterns, and unique arrangements. This is because modern merchants are well aware that if they do not study window displays carefully, they will not be able to attract passersby to stop and watch, and their business may fail as a result. Therefore, they must pay attention to window display.</p>
<p>The progress of window display has indeed achieved great results. You see, outside every store, there are always many passersby stopping to watch the items in the window. So, what is the average time each person spends watching the window? This is certainly an interesting question. It is said that the average time a man spends watching outside the window is three-tenths of a second less than a woman.</p>
<p>The results of this test were obtained over two years, after surveying 9,071 people. As a result, we know that the average time each passerby spends gazing at the window is 18.7 seconds. Women spend an average of 17.6 seconds watching outside the window, but if they are walking with another woman, the time spent watching the window increases to 20 seconds. If a man is walking with a woman, they spend an average of 20.9 seconds watching outside the window. Therefore, from these 9,071 people, we can obtain the following statistics:</p>
<p>A woman walking alone: 17.6 seconds</p>
<p>A man walking alone: 17.3 seconds</p>
<p>Two women: 20.0 seconds</p>
<p>A man and a woman: 20.9 seconds</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, women's time is mostly spent gazing at the windows of jewelry stores, while men mostly gaze at the windows of bookstores. In these places, they spend an average of 29 seconds, which is the longest viewing time.</p>
<p>Family Life</p>
<h3 id="e172">Economy and Family <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Zeyong</p>
<p>One afternoon, the weather was very hot and stuffy, so I went to a certain park to relax by myself.</p>
<p>In the deep shade of a corner, a modern young couple sat on a public bench, leaning close to each other, talking about their love. I couldn't help but be curious, so I secretly hid behind a tree to eavesdrop on their whispered secrets. The woman asked first, "Dear Mr. He, why are you so unhappy today?"</p>
<p>"Because yesterday my father told me that he had arranged a marriage for me with another woman, and the wedding will be held next month!" This was the man's reply. "Well, then you should marry that woman!" the woman said, with what seemed like a touch of jealousy in her tone.</p>
<p>"Ah! Dear Ms. Feng! Please don't doubt me. Besides you in my mind, no matter what, I will not marry another woman, because you are the angel in my heart!" the young man said to comfort her.</p>
<p>"Since that's the case, then you should break away from your family!"</p>
<p>"No… no, I dare not break away from my family…" the young man paused, and then said pantingly.</p>
<p>"Why can't you break away?"</p>
<p>"If I break away from my family, I will cut off my source of income!"</p>
<p>When I heard this, I couldn't help but sigh three times, so I went home to record it and submit it to this publication for the study of love among young men and women in general.</p>
<p>When I saw this manuscript, I discovered a common fallacy in the minds of young people these days. Modern marriage is based on freedom as a principle, which is true enough. If a young person already has an angel in their heart, but their parents insist on forcing them to marry another woman, this is indeed the parents' fault. In this day and age, parents should no longer overstep their bounds and make decisions for their children. However, young people must know that a happy family must have a good economy to maintain it. If you only talk about freedom of marriage, and do not first solve the problem of economic independence, this is a big mistake. If the family is originally wealthy, there may be no problem, but if the family is not wealthy, then young people should first seek the ability and methods of making a living. Freedom should be thorough, and not just partial. The current big family system has fundamentally shaken, and it should be economically independent to organize small families. The current family system in Europe and America is originally like this.</p>

<p>— Wuwei</p>
<p>(One of my miscellaneous feelings)</p>
<p>"Do you want ingots…?"</p>
<p>Under the dim light, such a voice came from the alley, reminding me that today is the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>From this desolate cry, I am reminded of the difficulty in changing customs. Old ideas still shroud the minds of a portion of the people, and the pitifulness of these producers. In our Zhejiang, in Shaoxing prefecture alone, there are more than 500,000 people engaged in the manufacture of tin foil! (the raw material for ingots!) Combining the whole province, there are no less than one million people. The capital used is no less than tens of millions of yuan. In this way, from the hands of the tin foil workers, it is transferred to the hands of the old women who make the ingots to sell to consumers, and then the ash from the foil is bought back and reprocessed. A meaningless cycle of production controls the fate of more than a million people. If we examine the value of their production, it consumes the material resources of the real human world! (food, clothing, housing, transportation, etc.!) What does it contribute to the unknowable underworld? This is an extremely comical phenomenon in our country's production sector. As a result, Zhejiang Province is equivalent to being short of one million people, and the country's 474 million people lose the productivity of one million people. The productivity of these one million people is all lost to the land of nothingness. I can't name it, so I call it "waste of life."</p>

<h3 id="e175">The Second and Sixteenth Days <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Shengwu</p>
<p>"Sir, boss, do a good deed, save the poor, cultivate virtue for your children and grandchildren." Every second or sixteenth day of the lunar calendar, from morning to dusk, there are always many beggars, men, women, old and young, who come to visit and plead in this way.</p>
<p>"Give him a copper coin and tell him not to come next time," a gentleman-like person said to his apprentice. "To prevent him from coming next time, we shouldn't give him anything this time, otherwise wouldn't it be inviting a wolf into the house?" As a result of the conversation, the beggar, of course, suffered a loss.</p>
<p>At first, on these days (the second or sixteenth), some gave and some didn't. As a result of the distribution, it never reached one hundred copper coins. Recently, it seems to be more than before. I wanted to know how much it would be in a day, so yesterday (April 16th) I distributed as much as possible. Later, I calculated that a total of 173 copper coins were given out, breaking the previous record. Beggars are gradually increasing, and public security will certainly be in danger. I wonder if those who are responsible for local public security are also considering this.</p>
