<p>時　　評</p>
<h3>國民爲何不問政治彬</h3>
<p>政治與人民之關聯。及人民必應過問政治之一問題。在二十世紀之今日。殆已毫無討論之餘地然而以我國文化推進之停滯。一般人民政治水平線之低下。此一不必討論之問題。今乃仍不得不提出而詳加闡述。并以喚起社會大衆之注意。此誠爲最足令人痛心之一現象。</p>
<p>今日我國家固昭然號稱「民主之國」也。「民主政治」「民主政府」之呼。聲固亦洋盈耳也然而按其實際。則大多數人民之思想與頭腦。仍爲「不識不知順帝之則」之觀念所支配對於政治。視爲與自身毫無關聯。置之不聞不問。年遭飢饉歳逢兵亂即顚沛流離。生無死所。亦不知其爲何而致此。而但謂爲「天意」與「命運」之必然。大多文化程度落後之工農羣衆。固無論矣。即一般知識份子。亦類都抱「不在其位不謀其政」之觀念對於政治取袖手旁觀之態度。其他如好爲立異鳴高者。則更視政治爲齷齪不可親近之途。更避之如恐不及有此不負責之國民而後政治乃能由少數之軍閥官僚政客所壟斷把持。寖且視爲大多數人民所不能不能問。軍閥政治與官僚政治形成。政治乃與大衆之利益日益背道而馳。故致使政治爲少數人所操縱把持。據爲私有。即由於吾人之不問政治。換言之。即由吾人之不負責任所造。成　　吾人常聞致力實業者。高呼「實業救國」矣。亦常聞致力敎育者。高呼「敎育救國」矣。但假如政治不上軌道。飢饉連年。民生凋敝苛捐雜稅。搜括無厭。官盡貪汚。吏皆狡詐。而又内亂頻仍。匪盗遍地。則所謂實業救國。果其有着手之餘地耶。所謂「敎育救國。」又果有着手之餘地耶。故捨政治而言救國。是誠有若緣木而求魚此爲最淺近最明顯易曉之理論。奈之何我國人。覚至今仍茫然罔覺耶</p>
<p>夫吾人一日有生。即一日不能離開政治。抑且吾人之行動。直接開接即皆足以影響政治。而同時亦受政治之影響。吾爲人類社會之一份子。食焉息焉與社會之關係。何等密切。我旣不能離社會而生存。即不能置社會之事於不聞不問。抑且我握有絕對可以聞問政治之神聖權力。任何人不能侵犯。正如我爲一公司之股東。握有絕對可以聞問公司一切事務之權力。此種譬喩。蓋至爲恰當。吾人於投有資本之公司中一切事務。則毎事必問。甚且不惜怒諸言。厲諸色。與人齗齗以爭。奈之何對於一國之事。爲吾人生所依賴者。竞漠然不肯一顧耶。</p>
<p>以我人之自棄其神聖之權力。致政治於不聞不問。坐令少數人壟斷把持。寖成今日之黑暗。外無以禦侮。内無以救災。國脈民命。不絕如縷。其咎豈僅在於少數之官僚政客與軍閥。</p>
<p>時危勢迫。國人今後亟應有政治之自覺。宜切實負起自身應負之責任。並運用其神聖之偉力。以裁抑軍閥政治與官僚政治。樹立眞正之民主政治。建設眞正之民主政府。如此而後中國乃能爭取光明之前途。</p>

<p>主張維持英日舊誼前任外相奥斯丁張伯倫稱、渠承認西門外相在國聯行政會集議時、團結各國趨於一致之大勢力、渠不贊成對於日本施用嚴酷言論、因嚴酷言論、從未能解决國際爭端也、渠亦不贊成藍斯堡所發如上海公共租界發生事變英人應即退去之建議蓋此種步驟、將有嚴重後果、摧毁英國在華之全部貿易、並使英國在亞洲諸國會議席中、不復具何勢力也、世人將視英人爲忘其固有美德之人民、旣不願扶助他人之待援者亦不願保護其在危險中之國人也、渠希望凡可阻止英日間舊有交誼之恢復者、不見於實施、英國對未有土地野心、但欲見中國强盛耳云、</p>
<p>日本虚僞宣傳撤兵外相西門稱日大使松平近告渠日本已發出訓令·撤回上海大部份日艦及若干陸軍、現聞初步和議業已圓滿結束、正式會議明舉行云、衆聞此言、歡聲大作、西門詳述日本在中國海上之艦隊力量、並謂日本現减少其在華海軍、較諸平時力量不大懸殊、渠非謂此種消息、完全令人興奮、蓋目下之地位、尙不能云爲遠東事變上海不部分終止前所必要之最後佈置業已告成、就戰事切實終止而言、此非爲吾人所須考慮之唯一事件、但此可視爲一件切實美滿的消息、英國以其當地使署領署與海陸軍代表之有價値的襄助、已盡力維持大局、而實施國聯之原則、英國已認眞設法與在滬其他列强合作、若英國採行單獨行動之特殊地位則無益可得也、吾人於久待之後、今已可得而言曰、美國現與吾人及在遠東有關係的列强聯合、共致力以促進國聯會章與非戰公約所共有之大目的、此層想下院可引以爲满意者也、渠不願過作樂觀語、前途非無荆棘、、惟最近消息、尙使人樂觀耳、</p>
<p>嚴重注意東省關稅西門旋提及保持東省中國關稅行政事、謂渠認爲可以採取辦法、兌解償付外債之稅欵、前有安東日領事曾請該處稅務司交出職權之傳說、惟日内瓦之日本代表已加否認、據渠所得報告、無論任何一方、未有企圖驅逐該處海關當局云、關稅係外債之担保、如有干涉外人對於海關應有之權利者、則英國將加以最嚴重之注意、即其他各國亦當如是、</p>
<p>承認僞國不欲考慮成謂滿洲國係日本所造成、惟此未能認爲已成立之事實、蓋未有調查及在對方否認之前、吾人未容臆斷、日政府、曾謂日本未見比其他各國、較易承認東省新政府、且否認該政府係日本所造成、故西門謂渠不欲發表批評、蓋各國應待國聯調查團之報告、不宜完全接受一方之消息、因之拒絶等候調查、西門旋稱、承認滿洲國一事、無論任何一國、似均認爲尙未及時、蓋於此種環境下創立之新國、未承認前、必須有充分調查、辨明其是否負責政府能於境内切實施政、並與列强發生關係、以及其能否眞實代表民意、不然則斷無承認之理、　　尊重中國土地完整最重要者、英國不能慫恿或容忍可漠視或破壞九國公約下中國土地完整之舉動、同時若謂在任何情勢之下、幅圓廣大之國如中國者、不致有一種分裂、則無此法律、亦無此常識、以事實言、此省或彼省之起事宜佈獨立者、固常見於中國歷史中也云、</p>
<p>西門譽掦國聯處置西門綜述國聯之事業、謂日内瓦過去數月中之進行、已表明會員國忠實贊助國聯之原則、任何外交當局之責任、在處置時事、不使其國家陷於徒然增重事態之地位今此責任、已履行之矣、渠不願謂英國隻手行事、因英國始終勉力與他國合作、英國政策縱有缺憾、然保持對中日兩國之完全友好關係、國聯議會所通過之議案、固亦表示大小各國之調和意見、美政府承認國聯議會之宣言、與美國所欲見諸採行者、意旨相合、此亦英政府所可得而言者、因是之故、美國準備在此事上與英國合作云、　　反對採用懲戒辦法西門又謂此後工作尙多、惟前所施行者、足以證明國聯爲</p>
<p>世界和平最善之保障、調解必須忍耐、并予以充分時間、但此時厥爲國聯實行其調解勢力最有希望之時期、如徒提及假定之懲戒辦法、誠非運用國聯勢力及謀兩方容納勸告之最善辦法、如謂國聯常提及制裁工具、便可在此種案中、獲取有效之力量則誤矣、國聯所眞正行使者及其成立所根據者、厥爲解釋及代表世界輿情者之地位、而世界輿論乃天然最大勢力之一、當世界公共勢力充分堅强一致、以宣佈道德上之切實讉責時、則裁制實不需用、英國固甚堅决遵守國聯會章下所有之義務、但渠以爲最好將國聯威脅的與調解的制裁、分别清楚、渠不認國聯宣言之軟弱、實則國聯議會所通過</p>
<p>之議案、含有甚嚴峻之表示、以擁護國聯所有原則、且議會議案、言及巴黎非戰公</p>
<p>約而引起美國之援助該議案聲明如以軍力壓迫解决爭執、則與國聯會章抵觸、故就上海而言、渠現欣然見日軍已撤退不少、在軍力壓迫下、不能獲有公允結局、已甚明瞭云、</p>
<p>▲不變對華根本政策外部次官艾登旋爲政府結束辯論、謂抨聲政府辦事不更嚴厲者、固有其人、但贊助政府政策者尤多、彼主張嚴厲政策者、殆不知英國如果出此、或將自處於孤立地位耳、至於東三省問題、英政府正在注意該處英人之利益、東省之爭執幾歷三十年、英政府愈加</p>
<p>研究、愈生畏懼之心、未敢遽爾参預是項爭端、故目前决候國聯調查團之報告、較爲得計、最近五年間中英關係有確實之進步、殊足引爲欣慰云、艾登認此進步爲實行前外相張伯倫對華政策之結果四即堅决保持英國及他國應有之利益、及同情於華人合理之願望、艾登謂此項政策、自應繼續實行云、下議院此次辯論各議員對於藍斯堡張伯倫及西門之演說、均注意聴之、與前次辯論藍斯堡發言時保守黨議員怒號促其停止者不同、（路透社二十二日倫敦電）</p>
<p>兩議員惑於日宣傳英國會下院、今日繼續辯論遠東時局、工黨議員麥克倫聲稱、日本對於澳洲、亦如對於中國之同様注目洛克藍浦生稱中國未能保護境内外僑、希望英政府停止撤廢領事裁判權談判、今日開會時、又有自由黨議員畢克林爲日本辯護、竟稱苟非中國與蘇俄秘密談判、以期阻撓日本、决不致發生目前時局、（譯者按畢、氏此語、可見日人之宣傳之巧妙與效力、愈以知我國於國際宣傳之急不容緩矣、）（國民社二十二日倫敦電）</p>

<h3>Why Don't Citizens Inquire About Politics?</h3>
<p>The connection between politics and the people, and the issue of whether the people should necessarily be concerned with politics, is something that hardly needs discussion in this 20th century. However, given the stagnation of cultural advancement in our country and the generally low political awareness of the people, this issue, which should not need discussion, must still be raised and thoroughly explained, in order to awaken the attention of the public. This is truly a most distressing phenomenon.</p>
<p>Today, our country openly proclaims itself to be a "democratic nation." The cries of "democratic politics" and "democratic government" also fill our ears. However, in reality, the thoughts and minds of the majority of the people are still dominated by the concept of "ignorant and unknowing, following the laws of the Emperor." They regard politics as having nothing to do with themselves, ignoring it and not inquiring about it. When they encounter famine years or suffer the chaos of war, they are displaced and have nowhere to die, yet they do not know why they are in this state. They only attribute it to "Heaven's will" and the inevitability of "fate." This is certainly the case with the majority of the culturally backward masses of workers and peasants. Even the general intellectuals mostly hold the view of "not planning policies when not in office," adopting a hands-off attitude towards politics. Others, who like to be unconventional and declare themselves superior, view politics as a dirty and unapproachable path, avoiding it as if they fear it. It is only with such irresponsible citizens that politics can be monopolized and controlled by a small number of warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians, and even be regarded as something that the majority of the people cannot inquire about. The formation of warlord politics and bureaucratic politics causes politics to increasingly deviate from the interests of the masses. Therefore, politics is manipulated and controlled by a few people and treated as private property. This is due to our failure to inquire about politics. In other words, it is created by our irresponsibility. We often hear those who devote themselves to industry shout "Industry Saves the Nation!" We also often hear those who devote themselves to education shout "Education Saves the Nation!" But if politics is not on the right track, with years of famine, economic decline, excessive taxes and levies, insatiable exploitation, officials all corrupt, clerks all cunning, and with frequent internal strife and bandits everywhere, is there any room for so-called "Industry Saves the Nation" to take action? Is there any room for so-called "Education Saves the Nation" to take action? Therefore, to talk about saving the nation without politics is truly like climbing a tree to catch fish. This is the most basic, most obvious, and easily understood theory. Why is it that the people of our country still remain ignorant and unaware?</p>
<p>As long as we live, we cannot be separated from politics for a single day. Moreover, our actions directly or indirectly affect politics, and at the same time, we are also affected by politics. We are a part of human society, eating and breathing in it, and our relationship with society is extremely close. Since we cannot live apart from society, we cannot ignore the affairs of society. Moreover, we hold the sacred power to inquire about politics, which no one can violate. Just as we are shareholders of a company, holding the absolute power to inquire about all the company's affairs. This analogy is very appropriate. We must inquire about everything in a company in which we have invested capital, and even angrily argue and quarrel with others. Why is it that we are indifferent and unwilling to even glance at the affairs of a country, on which our lives depend?</p>
<p>By abandoning our sacred power and ignoring politics, allowing a small number of people to monopolize and control it, we have gradually created the darkness of today. We have no way to defend ourselves from foreign aggression, nor to save ourselves from internal disasters. The nation's pulse and the people's lives are hanging by a thread. Can the blame be only on a small number of bureaucrats, politicians, and warlords?</p>
<p>With the crisis pressing and the situation urgent, the people of our country should urgently have political awareness from now on. They should earnestly take on the responsibilities they should bear and use their sacred power to restrain warlord politics and bureaucratic politics, establish true democratic politics, and build a true democratic government. Only then can China strive for a bright future.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Inquiry Team's Definite Date for Entering Beijing</h3>
<p>Leaving Shanghai by train and ship on the 26th of this month</p>
<p>Arriving in Peiping around the middle of April, reaching the Eastern Provinces</p>
<p>The League of Nations Inquiry Team, originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 28th, has now decided to leave Shanghai for Beijing on the morning of the 26th, by different routes. Yesterday morning, they met with representatives of our banking community to inquire about economic and financial issues. In the afternoon at 5 o'clock, they attended a tea party hosted by Cantonese people in Shanghai. In the evening, Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu hosted a banquet to welcome them. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Meeting with Zhang Gongquan and Others</h3>

<h3>Appointment of Legal Counsel</h3>
<p>The Inquiry Team officially appointed American Yang Ge as legal counsel yesterday. Mr. Yang is very knowledgeable about the Northeast and is currently in Shanghai. He accepted the letter of appointment yesterday and will travel north with the team at the time. China Should Pay Attention to the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>The Attitude of the Inquiry Team</h3>
<p>If there are changes, our country will have great difficulty in agreeing. A Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 22nd states that the 12th and 13th reports submitted by the representatives of the powers with special interests in the Shanghai International Settlement have recently been forwarded to the General Assembly by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations. The Chinese representative wrote to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations on March 19, stating that he had received a telegram from Vice President Song of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, stating that it was inconvenient to extend the League of Nations Inquiry Team's stay in Shanghai. If the team changes its attitude, it would not be something that the Chinese government could agree to. The team's mission was originally to investigate Manchuria, so the Chinese government hoped that it would go to Manchuria as soon as possible, etc. The Chinese representative requested that this telegram be notified to Chairman Hymans and the members of the Committee of Nineteen. The Secretary-General of the League of Nations replied that he had received the letter and that he believed that the Chinese government's views could be handled by the Chinese government itself, or by the Chinese assistants (referring to those participating in the Manchuria Inquiry Team), or by other methods directly notifying the Inquiry Team, and asked China to pay attention to the documents sent to the General Assembly on March 18. The documents stated the measures that had been taken. The Secretary-General's reply also stated that the Inquiry Team's mission had not changed in any way from that stipulated in the resolution of December 10. The Secretary-General will notify the Special Committee of the General Assembly and the Japanese representative of the Chinese letter and its reply.</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Northeast National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>Telegram to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Exposing the Japanese Conspiracy</p>
<p>The Northeast Compatriots National Salvation Association in Beijing sent a telegram, urgently, to the Shanghai newspapers, agencies, groups, and compatriots across the country, stating: Since the Mukden Incident, the people of our Northeast have been groaning under Japanese violence for more than half a year. Recently, they have even brazenly used the old trick of annexing Korea, instigating traitors to organize a puppet state of Manchuria, falsely claiming to be of popular will, hoping to confuse the world's hearing. Your esteemed association has now dispatched an inquiry team to the East, and you will surely report the Japanese cunning and deceitful conspiracies to the General Assembly truthfully, in order to expose the truth to the world. It is hoped that you will uphold justice, restore the integrity of our territory, relieve our people from their suffering, and fulfill your association's mission to protect peace. As for the puppet government of Manchuria, it was organized under Japanese coercion and incitement, and not only do the people of the Northeast vow to oppose it to the death. We respectfully express our sincerity, and we are extremely urgent, etc. Another telegram was sent to the League of Nations Inquiry Team, with similar wording, which will not be repeated. The rebellious traces of the puppet state of the violent Japanese are clearly visible, and it is hoped that you will unanimously oppose it. We are extremely expectant. The Northeast Compatriots National Salvation Association in Beijing, kowtows, sealed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Ceasefire Conference</h3>
<p>The meeting changed to a talk yesterday afternoon</p>
<p>The formal meeting can be held this morning</p>
<p>Dai Ji appointed as military representative</p>
<p>The Shanghai ceasefire conference, after holding the last informal meeting on the 21st of this month, decided on the agenda of the formal meeting and three basic principles. It was originally scheduled to hold the first formal meeting at the British Consulate at 10 a.m. yesterday. However, due to the military representatives not being fully decided, yesterday's meeting did not take place and was changed to today. Our military representatives, except for Chief of Staff Huang Qiang who has not been changed, have decided to have Dai Ji represent. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Preparing to hold a meeting today. The issue of the Shanghai ceasefire and the withdrawal of Japanese troops has now been decided to hold a formal meeting at the British Consulate at 10 a.m. this morning. Our military representatives, the Central Government has appointed Dai Ji, commander of the Songhu Garrison, and Huang Qiang, chief of staff of the 19th Route Army, to take office. Commander Dai and Chief of Staff Huang have already expressed their agreement last night and are preparing to attend the meeting this morning. Our chief representative is still Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi. The Japanese representatives are still Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu, Commander Ueda of the 9th Division of Japan, Chief of Staff Tashiro, and Chief of Staff Shimada of the Navy. Regarding the group, British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, French Minister Wilden, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano, and naval commanders of various countries stationed in Shanghai will also attend. This morning's meeting will proceed according to the three principles agreed upon on Monday to determine the details. The most difficult to resolve will be the procedures for the withdrawal of Japanese troops and the administrative issues of the withdrawal area. The formal meeting was announced to be adjourned yesterday due to the problem of military representatives, and changed to a talk at noon, which lasted about an hour.</p>
<p>Reuters Nanjing, 13th, reported that the headquarters of the 19th Route Army officially announced today that when China and Japan hold the first formal peace conference tomorrow, Dai Ji will be the chief military representative of the Chinese side.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Meeting's Postponement</h3>
<p>According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, before the formal meeting was held, both sides had originally decided that the military representatives attending would be the highest-ranking military officers from both sides of the fighting, Shirokawa and Jiang Guangding. However, when the preparatory meeting was held on Monday, the Japanese side suddenly proposed that Ueda be the highest-ranking military representative to attend. They suddenly changed the original agreement that had been negotiated before. Therefore, our military side had to request instructions from the central government in order to consider sending an appropriate counterpart to attend. Jiang Guangding, commander-in-chief of our 19th Route Army, also considered the importance of this matter and met with Mr. Song Ziwen the day before yesterday. Then, in the forenoon of the day before yesterday, he took a car to Beijing to ask for instructions.</p>
<p>Jiang Flew to Shanghai on an Airplane. After taking a car to Hangzhou the forenoon of the day before yesterday, Mr. Jiang Guangding returned to Beijing by the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway in the evening to discuss everything with the central authorities. He also telegraphed the rear office of the 19th Army that evening, giving instructions. Yesterday morning, he telegraphed the rear office twice again, making inquiries. Mr. Jiang also flew to Shanghai from Beijing by airplane at about 10 a.m., arriving at the port at 12 noon and returning to his residence to rest.</p>
<h3>19th Route Army Statement Regarding the Ceasefire Conference</h3>
<p>As for the reason for the postponement yesterday, external rumors said that the 19th Route Army was dissatisfied with the current ceasefire negotiations of the diplomatic authorities. The spokesperson of the rear office of the 19th Route Army officially stated yesterday that the actions of our military authorities and the diplomatic authorities are consistent and obey the central government. There is no discord. If the government appoints someone to attend, the military authorities will naturally obey the order to participate. It is hoped that the outside world will not believe the instigation of villains.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Continue to Arrive</h3>
<p>More Japanese soldiers have arrived. While Japan is promoting the withdrawal of troops, the 14th Division in Liuhe, Nanxiang, Jiading, and other places is digging the latest type of trenches and carrying out its combat preparations. Their supplementary troops are still being transported here in a continuous stream. From 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. yesterday, the transport ships Tsukuba Maru, Annam Maru, and Tango Maru arrived again, carrying about a thousand supplementary soldiers and engineers. Most of them were wearing civilian clothes and landed at Yangshupu. Most of them were transported to Liuhe and Nanxiang. Military equipment is being loaded. In the most recent half month, the amount of military equipment transported by Japan has been huge. The largest tanks, the largest field artillery, and ammunition have been continuously moved to Nanxiang. Yesterday afternoon, a large amount of military equipment for digging trenches and arranging defenses, as well as trench steel plates, etc., were also transported here. There were many kinds and huge quantities. They were all shielded with wooden boxes and oilcloth to prevent the Chinese from seeing them. It is said that there is also a batch of chemical military equipment inside. When unloading, some of it was secretly stored in the Huishan military depot, and some of it was transferred to the front. At 3:30 p.m., another batch of military supplies was shipped from Dalian to Shanghai and unloaded at the Huangpu Wharf. Warships are entering the port. At 2 p.m. yesterday afternoon, a Japanese navy 26th tunnel warship sailed to Shanghai and immediately entered the Huangpu River. At 2:30 p.m., three torpedo ships of the 13th Squadron successively entered Woosung. The ships were carrying army troops and anchored on the Yangshupu River. The soldiers disembarked. After the four ships arrived in Shanghai, the two ships of the 15th Squadron on the Huangpu River left Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Guizhou Compatriots Request Relief for Teng Jiushou</h3>
<p>The chief of staff of the Wusong Fortress, who died in the anti-Japanese war, at noon on February 4, the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on the Wusong Fortress. The chief of staff of the fortress, Mr. Teng Jiushou, was ordered to supervise the battle. At that time, enemy planes and warships were fiercely bombing, and the smoke filled the air, making it impossible to see people five steps away. The traces of bullets were everywhere in the fortress, all of which had become pits one or two zhang deep. Mr. Teng personally led the officers and soldiers to resist bravely. Under the fierce artillery fire of the enemy army, he was shot and killed in the fortress. The remains were no longer a corpse. Teng Jiuzhi, age 33, from Dujiang County, Guizhou Province. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, he graduated from the artillery department of the Guizhou Army Lecture School. He successively filled the positions of platoon, company, battalion, and regimental commander in the Guizhou Army. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, he entered Guangdong and served as an instructor at the Chaozhou Branch of the Central Military and Political School. He was then transferred to serve as the chief of staff of the Chaozhou-Meizhou Garrison Headquarters.

Image of Teng Jiushou.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth year, he was transferred to serve as a supervisor of the Training Directorate. In the winter of that year, he was transferred to serve as the chief of staff of the Wusong Fortress. In his lifetime, he often encouraged himself to serve the country with loyalty. This time, he sacrificed his life for the country and fulfilled his wish. The Guizhou compatriots, because he left behind a wife and a son, the older one only eighteen months old, and the younger one not yet a full month old, although they are sheltered in the Huaisheng Hospital on Malang Road, their lives are difficult and their situation is extremely miserable. Moreover, they are tens of thousands of miles away in a foreign land, making it difficult to return to their hometown. Therefore, they have decided to petition the central government to immediately find ways to provide relief and pensions to the families of these soldiers who died for the country, in order to comfort the loyal souls and encourage those who come after.</p>

Representatives of Compatriots Associations from Various Provinces</p>
<h3>Presented a Written Report to the Inquiry Team Yesterday</h3>

They reported on the damage suffered by Shanghai since the Japanese army invaded Shanghai in written form in both Chinese and English to the team, hoping that they would resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute with justice. When the representatives arrived at the residence of the Inquiry Team, Lord Lytton was out on business, and Councilor Xiao Jirong of the Chinese Representative Office received them on behalf of the team and agreed to forward the report. In addition, the National Salvation United Association initiated by the compatriots associations from various provinces and regions is currently being organized and will convene a representative meeting soon. It will negotiate with the diplomatic authorities of our country who are conducting peace talks based on public opinion, not to be subjugated by the violent Japanese and sign treaties that humiliate the country and cede power, increasing public anger.</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association</p>
<h3>Opposes National Humiliating Diplomacy</h3>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association telegraphed the Beijing authorities, stating: Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government and President Wang of the Executive Yuan, may it please your attention. The League of Nations is discussing the withdrawal of Japanese troops occupying the Northeast, but we are only discussing the withdrawal of troops from Shanghai. Representative Yan solemnly declared in the League of Nations that the so-called withdrawal of troops refers to the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese territory, but we are discussing the withdrawal to the concessions and even the temporary stationing in areas adjacent to the concessions, which is truly shocking. The people vow to oppose such national humiliating negotiations that violate the principles of the League of Nations and our own proposals. The All-Zhejiang Public Association kowtows. Another telegram was sent to Vice Minister Guo of the Shanghai Diplomatic Office with the same wording, requesting that he strive for unity.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Those who took up arms reached 200,000 people</p>
<p>The Japanese army's power only extends to the railway lines</p>
<p>Professor Zhang of Northeastern University arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday, at the Anti-Japanese Progressive Association of the Chinese Social Society, he invited waiting news reporters to report on the recent situation of the Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army in the Northeast as follows: The Northeast was occupied by Russia in 1900. Until the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, Japan won and Russia began to withdraw. During the occupation, order was very chaotic, and the people had to defend themselves. As it became a battlefield for the Russo-Japanese War, the losses suffered by our people were even greater, and the spirit of self-defense also increased. From then on, the people of the Northeast cultivated many heroes and the spirit of the greenwoodsmen. Otherwise, the land in the Northeast is fertile and the population is sparse, making it easy to make a living. Why would there be so many bandits? Moreover, the international relations in the Northeast are extremely complex, and the greenwoodsmen are often protected. Among the ordinary people, because there are many bandits, they cannot but arm themselves for safety. Therefore, the people of the Northeast are very strong in self-defense. The total number of civilian guns is about two million. Since the September 18th Incident, although the authorities of the Eastern Provinces retreated without resistance, the people had long been bullied by the Japanese and could not but seek self-defense. Therefore, there was no shortage of people who revolted. The organization of the Volunteer Army was like bamboo shoots after a rain. Local militias, greenwoodsmen heroes, and lower-level military officers were all melted into one furnace. By the time the Japanese attacked Jinzhou, the Volunteer Army had considerable power and had launched a large-scale attack on the enemy when the formal army withdrew. However, as the authorities of the Eastern Provinces insisted on a policy of non-resistance and Ma Zhanshan reconciled with the Japanese, the momentum of the Volunteer Army was greatly isolated, and there were not a few who collapsed and defected. But those who remain to this day are all pure patriots, with the determination to perish with the Japanese. Since the establishment of the puppet state, the Japanese ambition and the lack of conscience of the traitors have been exposed to the world. Local militias, who had always maintained a steady attitude, have also taken up arms. The Japanese are already exhausted in dealing with them. As for the leaders of the Volunteer Army, such as Jin Dexuan, Li Fangting, Geng Jizhou, Shi Anquan, Yu Mingjia, Li Xuhua, Che Wenchen, Huang Zhou, Yu Baisi, Zhang Haitao, Li Pizu, Lao Beifeng, Xiao Bailong, Long Jiaqi, Xiu Yichen, and more than a hundred others, the total number is about 200,000 people. The strategy of the Northeastern people in resisting the enemy is purely field warfare, not decisive battles. They all move at night and hide during the day, avoiding the strong and attacking the weak, and turning the large into the small. The Japanese power is only on the railway lines. Outside the railway lines, the Japanese dare not go. Even the large army only goes fifty miles beyond the railway, because they must return to the railway area on the same day.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ming-chi Extradition</h3>
<p>Chiang Claims to be a Literary Man</p>
<p>Hopes for Favorable Treatment</p>
<p>Chiang Ming-chi, a Sichuan native who once served as supervisor of students studying in Japan, was apprehended in connection with the already-dismantled Southeast Self-Defense Army. The Municipal Public Security Bureau requested assistance from the Public Concession Police, who captured Chiang at the residence of Zhang Zhijiang's younger brother (Jiangsu Relief Supervisor), located at No. 744 Seymour Road. Important correspondence between Chiang and Japanese envoy Shigemitsu Mamoru, along with passbooks and silver dollars, were seized. These were handed over to the First Special District Local Court, which ordered Chiang temporarily detained pending a formal request from the Public Security Bureau for his transfer. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Now, Director Wen Yinxing has prepared a formal letter and dispatched Detective Zhai Haitian, who this morning at 10:00 AM, presented it to the First Special District Court requesting the transfer. Judge Feng Shide opened the court for interrogation. Detective Zhai reported that Chiang Ming-chi, a suspect in the Southeast Self-Defense Army case, had already been transferred to the Garrison Headquarters, so he could not bring the case for verification today. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that this case was initiated by the Public Security Bureau, and based on the evidence obtained, Chiang was indeed significantly involved. The Municipal Council, in order to fulfill the agreement, had no objection to the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer. However, Chiang's defense lawyer, Fan Gang, argued that the Public Security Bureau had not brought the implicated individuals to confront Chiang, considering the evidence insufficient and opposing the transfer. Chiang Ming-chi echoed this argument, stating: 1) Why, if those who implicated me were arrested by the police and interrogated by the High Court, was my name not mentioned, but only mentioned by the Public Security Bureau? 2) I am a literary man, and should not be judged by military tribunals before conclusive proof. 3) I was ill when arrested, so the statements made to the police cannot be considered formal confessions. In short, I implore the court to uphold justice, protect human rights, and conduct a detailed investigation, and not to hastily transfer me. Otherwise, I, Chiang, would rather die than be transferred. Judge Feng ruled that this was an assistance case, and the evidence had already been investigated. Therefore, the previous court decision to allow the transfer was upheld. Since the Public Security Bureau had sent an official letter to the court, it was deemed credible. Regarding confrontation, you can confront them after you arrive at the Public Security Bureau. Hearing this, Chiang requested notification of the Public Security Bureau's staff and asked for favorable treatment after arriving, as he was a literary man. Judge Feng ordered that Chiang Ming-chi and all items seized from Chiang be handed over to the detective to be taken back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The 945 silver dollars were proven to belong to a Mr. Yang, who shared a room with Chiang, and should be returned to the original owner.</p>
<h3>Case of Illegally Forming Military Organizations</h3>
<p>Suspects Transferred to Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>According to a tip from a Mr. Shui to Lu Ying, the chief detective of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, a military organization was being formed in the pavilion upstairs at No. 27 Deyu Lane, Lloyd Road, Public Concession, issuing fake commissions and engaging in fraudulent activities. Chief Lu, along with team leaders Gao Wansheng, and officers Lu Anpu, Zhou Wenhai, Zhang Changxi, and Hu KuiSheng, went to the Zhabei Police Station to dispatch detectives and proceeded to the address, where they arrested Zhao Binliang, Yang Zifang, Chen Lianqing, Zhu Hongxiang, Zhong Chuangguo, He Zhixiang, Wang Desheng, Li Guoxiang, Hu Guoqing, and nine others. They seized a commission from the 1st and 3rd Brigades of the Newly Organized National Revolutionary Army 60th Army, two commissions from the National Salvation Army, and other documents and account books. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Qian presided over the interrogation. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the circumstances of the case, saying that the Public Security Bureau's request for transfer was not opposed by the police. According to Zhao Binliang's testimony, the 60th Army was recognized by the Guangdong Military Commission and then transferred to the unified government, and was also recognized by the Ministry of Military Affairs. In December of last year, I was the 3rd Brigade Commander of the 1st Division of the Political Committee, which was publicly announced in the newspaper, and there was no fraud. The other eight suspects mostly denied the accusations. Judge Qian ordered that Zhao Binliang and the other nine be handed over to the staff of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to be taken back for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Air Service Continues Extra Flights</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Post Office, the Beijing-Shanghai air mail service will continue to operate an extra round-trip flight daily for two weeks starting from the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Workers Relief Association Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Unemployed Workers Relief Association, jointly established by the Social Bureau and sixteen other organizations, held its first committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The meeting discussed the detailed rules for each section, which were approved in principle. The drafting of each section's work plan was assigned to the drafting committee members, who were required to submit them for review within three days. Zhang Zhenyuan, Xu Yefu, and Feng Liutang were appointed as review committee members. In addition, a formal document was prepared to be submitted to the Municipal Government through the Social Bureau to report the establishment of the association.</p>
<h3>Losses of Factories in Wusong</h3>
<p>The Yong An Cotton Mill and the Taixing Road Zhonghua National Sugar Factory, both located on Yunzao Road, Wusong, each occupy over a hundred acres and are large in scale. Tens of thousands of workers rely on them for their livelihoods. After being occupied by the Japanese army, the engines and machinery in the machine rooms of both factories have been dismantled and transported out by ship for several days. The losses are estimated to be over one million yuan each. In addition, machinery from the China Iron Works and the Zhiming Electric Power Plant have also been taken away. However, the largest loss is undoubtedly the Railway Factory in Zhanghuabang, as Japanese soldiers are stationed there, making it difficult to investigate the situation.</p>
<h3>Chinese Workers Refuse to Work in Japanese Factories in West Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Nei Wai Cotton Mill on Xiaoshadu Road, the Kiwa Cotton Mill on Rue Robert, the Stock Company Hemp Bag Factory, and the Rihua Cotton Mill on Pinlang Road, all operated by Japanese merchants in West Shanghai, officially resumed operations on the previous and current days. However, after the morning and evening whistles, not a single worker showed up for work. The Japanese factories are very anxious. Although they have threatened to hire new workers if the old workers do not return to work, all of our workers are united and determined never to work in Japanese factories again.</p>
<p>Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<h3>Statistics for Municipal Population in February</h3>
<p>819,600 Fewer People Than in January The Household Registration Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau released the city's population statistics for February of this year yesterday. However, because the 4th, 5th, 7th, and 3rd districts (i.e., Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong) were in the war zone and could not be surveyed, they were excluded. The population of the concessions is based on the survey by the Special District Police Department. The following is a table: (Chinese) Each district of the city (excluding war zones): 666,608 people; Public Concession: 971,397 people; French Concession: 421,885 people. Total: 2,459,890 people.

<p>Municipal Education Bureau</p>
<h3>Statistics on Losses of Cultural Institutions</h3>
<p>The Japanese army's invasion of Shanghai, using airplanes and artillery to destroy public and private institutions and cultural organizations, has caused losses unprecedented since the European War. In particular, the losses suffered by cultural institutions and universities due to Japanese bombing are the most significant. In light of the severe destruction of cultural organizations in Shanghai by the Japanese army, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has begun to investigate and compile information for reference in diplomatic negotiations with Japan. The bureau is actively investigating, classifying, and compiling statistics on the various cultural institutions, and will submit a report to the Ministry of Education and the foreign affairs authorities. It will also send a copy of these statistics to the League of Nations investigation team before they leave Shanghai, so that the League of Nations investigation team can understand the impropriety of Japan's violation of international law in invading Shanghai and the magnitude of the losses suffered by our cultural center.</p>
<h3>Jinan University President Zheng Hongnian Flew to Guangdong Yesterday</h3>
<p>To Resolve the Studies of Students Remaining in Guangdong</p>
<p>To Negotiate the Loan of Zhongda School Buildings for the Start of School</p>
<p>After Jinan University officially started classes on the 21st of this month, everything has been proceeding smoothly. There are about 500 new and old students in total. The president of the university, Zheng, held a public banquet for all faculty and staff at the Da Dong Restaurant the night before. More than 80 faculty and staff members attended that evening. During the banquet, President Zheng, on behalf of the students' parents, thanked the faculty and staff, and said that since the January 28th Incident, many students of the university have gone to Guangdong. According to recent reports, there are more than 300 people. After first requesting Zhongda to accommodate them for study, because students from various schools in the Shanghai war zone who returned to Guangdong requested to borrow and study there, there were more than a thousand people, making it impossible to accommodate them. Recently, an agreement was reached with President Zou of Zhongda to temporarily borrow the Zhongda school buildings for classes, and to hire Zhongda professors to teach part-time. However, because all matters related to the start of school are very important, I have to go to Guangzhou in person in order to discuss and handle matters with President Zou. According to Zheng, this trip to Guangdong is specifically for school matters, and he will stay in Guangdong for about two weeks before returning to Shanghai. It is also heard that the establishment of a school in Guangdong by the university will not only allow the students of Jinan University remaining in Guangdong</p>

<h3>Xinqiao and Xinzha Bridges Open Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in this city, the authorities of the Public Concession have attached great importance to the bridges over the Suzhou River, and the defense of the boatyard Xinqiao and Xinzha Bridges in West Shanghai has been even more strict. All of them were cut off. Because the armistice talks are in progress, in order to facilitate pedestrians, the small iron gate of Xinqiao Block was opened for passage, but it was still closed at night.

Only a small number of personnel are engaged in investigation, relief, and publicity, and they have to work day and night. During the period of martial law, in order to facilitate the contact between citizens, some personnel were assigned to serve in the concession. Therefore, the report in yesterday's newspaper was a misunderstanding.</p>

<h3>Lawyers Association General Meeting Notice</h3>

<h3>Rice Shops Temporarily Increase Porterage</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Branch Office of the Shanghai Rice Industry Association sent a letter to all its members yesterday: "Dear Sirs, since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, all industries have been suspended. Our rice industry is related to the people's food and public security, and we have reported that we will resume operations as soon as possible. However, transportation is inconvenient and difficult, and freight vehicles are often detained for dispatch. The porters feel distressed and sigh frequently. Our office, in order to sympathize with the porters and help them make a living, allows the porters to increase the porterage by 30% in accordance with the usual rules, and no extra demands are allowed. Once transportation is restored and there are no lead nets and sandbags to block the road, the 30% increase in porterage will be cancelled immediately, and the usual rules will still apply. However, when rice shops trade with the same industry, or because of a change in the style, or because the mouth of the peck is full, they often withhold the porterage and do not pay it. This is the entanglement of the business of the firm and is left to the third party porters. Not only are the porters wronged, but they also teach the porters an excuse to ask for compensation and cause incidents. In the future, if a store does not pay the porterage, our fellow traders should be responsible for collecting it on their behalf in order to prevent the porters from making excuses and avoid disputes. All wharf fees are still in accordance with the usual rules and are not increased. However, if the rice boat is close to the wharf, the workers can go up and down, and if they still use the paddle to unload, the corresponding lighterage fee shall be paid by the fellow traders themselves in order to comply with the established regulations. Please note this."</p>

<p>The bidding trend is still good, but the cash flow from various parties is different, and the market price fluctuates constantly. It still hovers around 12 taels. Initially, due to the different trend of the silver market, the British pound fell and the US dollar rose, causing the price to rise as soon as the market opened. However, the foreign exchange market was clearly loose but secretly stable, so the price fluctuated.

The market was extremely strong, and it had already broken through 690 taels. In the end, it rose by more than 8 taels. There was no market in the afternoon.

It was just heard that China-Belgium Banking Corporation absorbed 32.375 yuan in June, and banks also</p>
<p>made transactions of 3125 yuan in March, and Hengyu and others successively purchased them, so the price rose again by more than 4 taels, reaching 89.5 cents at 10:30. Later, Yuan Maoyong and others came to sell, and British gold for this month was settled at 9 pence 375, falling by 56 taels to 83 taels 8 cents at 11:00. Afterwards, Fuyu and others bought on behalf of a certain bank, and Yuanheng and others followed suit, and the price instantly broke through 90 taels. It was also heard that a certain bank's purchaser bought more than 400 bars of spot goods, but the price was 6 taels lower than the futures price. However, the market sentiment was strong, and it rose sharply by more than 11 taels in this half hour, reaching 95 taels at 11:30. When zero households sold out, it fell back to 91.1 taels and then to 93 taels 3 cents. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 92 taels 7 cents, an increase of 8 taels 7 cents compared to the day before yesterday. The maximum was 95 taels and the minimum was 83</p>
<p>taels, with a difference of 12 taels. The listed price was changed to 755 taels, which is a discount of 68 taels, with a maximum and minimum difference of 72 taels.

<p>Yesterday, HSBC's various exchanges listed half a point higher, calculated at 1 shilling 9 pence for British gold at 125, and only added 125 to the US dollar, at 31 yuan 75.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I have recently read the solemn announcement of the Huasheng Motor Company in the Shen Xin newspapers on the 23rd of this month, stating that a car with number 1764 was detained by the volunteer army, and its passenger, Mr. Ye, was bailed out by Zhang Jinfa, a member of the Northern District Fire Brigade. Although not important, after checking, there is no Zhang Jinfa among the members of our fire brigade. It is thought to be a miscommunication. I am hereby sending a letter to clarify the situation and publish it in the Letters to the Editor section to reveal the truth. Sincerely, Lu Jinlin, Director of the Northern Fire Brigade in the Southern District of Shanghai, March 23rd.</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor, I recently read in today's newspaper the section on the form for Christians to report losses, and there are some discrepancies with the facts. Although our association has discussed changing its name, it has never been changed to the "National Restoration Association," and the team leader, Zhong Gong Shujing, is actually a mistake for Ding Xiang Fumei. Please publish a correction in your newspaper to reflect the facts. We would be grateful. Wishing you a pleasant composition. Sincerely, The Chinese</p>
<p>Christian National Salvation Association, March 23rd.</p>

<h3>Dispute Over Film Screening in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing: On the afternoon of the 23rd, the Guomin Grand Theater in Nanjing screened "The Shanghai Holocaust," produced by the Tianyi Film Company. The audience, feeling that the film extensively depicted the fierce bombing by Japanese aircraft, tanks, and heavy artillery, as well as the damage suffered by our military and civilians, was tantamount to propaganda for enemy military power. A commotion erupted throughout the theater, and order was temporarily disrupted. A certain accountant of the theater clashed with the audience on the third floor, resulting in a fall from the window to the ground, causing severe injuries. He was immediately transported to the Central Hospital for treatment. His condition is difficult to predict.

<h3>Li Fanyi Discusses Reforming Telecommunications Administration</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Li Fanyi, Director of the Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications, told reporters on the 23rd that the Ministry is currently reforming the long-standing abuses in local telegraph offices as much as possible. Measures include the submission of translation fees to the Ministry for construction funds, staff reductions, and expense cuts. The major obstacle to reforming telecommunications administration is the occasional unauthorized appointment of telegraph bureau chiefs by military officers who do not understand the administrative system. It is hoped that this will not happen again in the future. Regarding military telegram fees, it is proposed to issue a type of military license. Military agencies must purchase these licenses from the telegraph bureau at half price before sending telegrams. However, the implementation date of this matter has not been determined. Furthermore, regarding foreign telegraph companies, such as Great Eastern, landing in the Huangpu River area, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are currently discussing and negotiating the matter.

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>British House of Commons</h3>
<p>Debates Far East Incident</p>
<p>Liberal Party Members Confused by Propaganda, Defend Japan. Await League of Nations Investigation Team Report on Eastern Provinces Issue. ▲ Japan's Invasion of China a Grave Mistake. Labor Party Leader Lansbury Initiated Debate on Far East Incident in House of Commons Today to Ascertain Government Policy. Lansbury Said Months Have Passed Without Progress Toward Resolution. While Acknowledging Japan's Position and Inability to Obtain Sufficient Markets, He Believed Japan Had Made a Grave Mistake in China. The Position Taken by the United States in Conjunction with the League of Nations Should Be Appreciated by All Countries, He Said. Lansbury Then Asked Foreign Secretary Simon What Measures the League of Nations Intended to Use to Withdraw Japanese Troops from the Three Eastern Provinces. What Actions Has Japan Taken Regarding Tariffs in the Three Eastern Provinces? Lansbury Asked the Foreign Secretary to Notify the Japanese Government to Note That Such Actions Were Incompatible with British Interests, the League of Nations Charter, and the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>Advocating Maintaining Old Friendship Between Britain and Japan. Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain Said He Recognized the Great Influence of Foreign Secretary Simon in Unifying All Countries at the League of Nations Executive Council Meeting. He Did Not Approve of Harsh Rhetoric Toward Japan Because Harsh Rhetoric Has Never Resolved International Disputes. He Also Disapproved of Lansbury's Suggestion That the British Should Withdraw Immediately If an Incident Occurred in the Shanghai International Settlement, as This Step Would Have Serious Consequences, Destroying All of Britain's Trade in China and Depriving Britain of Any Influence in Conferences of Asian Countries. The World Will See the British as a People Who Have Forgotten Their Inherent Virtues, Unwilling to Help Others in Need and Unwilling to Protect Their Nationals in Danger. He Hoped That Nothing That Could Prevent the Restoration of the Old Friendship Between Britain and Japan Would Be Implemented. Britain Has No Territorial Ambitions But Wants to See China Strong, He Said.</p>
<p>Japan's False Propaganda About Troop Withdrawal. Foreign Secretary Simon Said Japanese Ambassador Matsudaira Recently Told Him That Japan Had Issued Instructions to Withdraw Most of Its Warships and Some of Its Army from Shanghai. It Is Now Heard That Preliminary Peace Talks Have Been Concluded Successfully and That the Formal Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow, He Said. The Audience Cheered When They Heard This. Simon Detailed Japan's Naval Strength in Chinese Waters and Said Japan Was Now Reducing Its Naval Forces in China, Which Was Not Significantly Different from Its Usual Strength. He Did Not Mean This News Was Completely Exciting, as the Current Position Cannot Be Said to Be the Final Arrangement Necessary Before the End of the Shanghai Not Part of the Far East Incident. In Terms of a Real End to the War, This Is Not the Only Thing We Need to Consider, But This Can Be Seen as a Truly Wonderful Message. Britain, With the Valuable Assistance of Its Local Embassies, Consulates, and Army and Navy Representatives, Has Done Its Best to Maintain the Overall Situation and Implement the Principles of the League of Nations. Britain Has Sincerely Tried to Cooperate with Other Powers in Shanghai. It Would Be Unproductive for Britain to Take a Special Position of Independent Action. After a Long Wait, We Can Now Say That the United States Is Now United with Us and the Powers Concerned in the Far East to Promote the Common Goals of the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This Is Something That the House of Commons Can Be Satisfied With. He Did Not Want to Be Too Optimistic, as There Were Still Thorns Ahead. However, Recent News Is Still Optimistic.</p>
<p>Serious Attention to Eastern Provinces Tariffs. Simon Then Mentioned Maintaining the Chinese Customs Administration in the Eastern Provinces, Saying He Believed That Measures Could Be Taken to Exchange Taxes to Repay Foreign Debt. There Were Previous Rumors That the Japanese Consul in Andong Had Asked the Customs Officer There to Hand Over His Powers, But the Japanese Representative in Geneva Had Denied It. According to Reports He Had Received, Neither Side Had Attempted to Expel the Customs Authorities There. Tariffs Are the Guarantee of Foreign Debt, and If There Is Interference with the Rights of Foreigners to Customs, Britain Will Pay the Most Serious Attention, as Will Other Countries.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the Puppet State, Unwilling to Consider Becoming. Called Manchuria Was Created by Japan, But This Could Not Be Considered a Fact, as We Should Not Speculate Before There Is an Investigation and Denial by the Other Party. The Japanese Government Has Said That Japan Has Not Found It Easier Than Other Countries to Recognize the New Government of the Eastern Provinces and Has Denied That the Government Was Created by Japan. Therefore, Simon Said He Did Not Want to Express Criticism, as All Countries Should Wait for the Report of the League of Nations Investigation Team and Should Not Completely Accept Information from One Side. Therefore, He Refused to Wait for the Investigation. Simon Then Said That No Country Seemed to Think That It Was Time to Recognize Manchuria, as a New Country Established Under Such Circumstances Must Be Fully Investigated Before Recognition to Determine Whether It Is a Responsible Government That Can Effectively Govern Within Its Territory and Establish Relations with the Powers, and Whether It Can Truly Represent Public Opinion. Otherwise, There Is No Reason for Recognition. The Most Important Thing Is to Respect China's Territorial Integrity. Britain Cannot Encourage or Tolerate Actions That Can Disregard or Undermine China's Territorial Integrity Under the Nine-Power Treaty. At the Same Time, It Is Not Possible to Say That Under Any Circumstances, a Country as Large as China Will Not Have a Split. In Fact, It Is Common in Chinese History for This Province or That Province to Declare Independence, He Said.</p>
<p>Simon Praised the League of Nations' Handling. Simon Summarized the League of Nations' Work, Saying That the Progress Made in Geneva Over the Past Few Months Has Shown That Member States Faithfully Support the Principles of the League of Nations. The Responsibility of Any Diplomatic Authority Is to Handle Events Without Putting Its Country in a Position That Would Only Aggravate the Situation. This Responsibility Has Been Fulfilled. He Did Not Want to Say That Britain Was Acting Alone Because Britain Has Always Strived to Cooperate with Other Countries. Although There May Be Shortcomings in British Policy, Maintaining Complete Friendly Relations with Both China and Japan, the Resolution Passed by the League of Nations Council Also Represents the Harmonious Views of Large and Small Countries. The U.S. Government's Recognition of the League of Nations Council's Declaration Is in Accordance with What the United States Wants to See Implemented, Which Is Also What the British Government Can Say Because of This, the United States Is Prepared to Cooperate with Britain on This Matter, He Said. Opposing the Adoption of Disciplinary Measures. Simon Also Said That There Was Still Much Work to Be Done in the Future, But What Has Been Implemented Is Enough to Prove That the League of Nations Is</p>
<p>The Best Guarantee of World Peace. Mediation Must Be Patient and Given Plenty of Time, But This Is the Most Promising Time for the League of Nations to Exercise Its Mediation Power. Merely Mentioning Hypothetical Disciplinary Measures Is Not the Best Way to Use the Power of the League of Nations and Seek Accommodation Between the Two Sides. It Would Be Wrong to Say That the League of Nations Could Gain Effective Power in Such Cases by Constantly Mentioning Enforcement Tools. What the League of Nations Truly Exercises and What Its Establishment Is Based on Is Its Position of Interpreting and Representing World Opinion, and World Opinion Is One of the Greatest Natural Forces. When World Public Power Is Sufficiently Strong and Consistent to Declare Real Moral Condemnation, No Restraint Is Needed. Britain Is Very Determined to Abide by All Obligations Under the League of Nations Charter, But He Believes That It Is Best to Distinguish Clearly Between the League of Nations' Threatening and Conciliatory Sanctions. He Does Not Recognize the Weakness of the League of Nations Declaration. In Fact, the Resolution Passed by the League of Nations Council</p>
<p>Contains a Very Stern Expression to Uphold All the Principles of the League of Nations, and the Council's Resolution Refers to the Paris Peace Pact</p>
<p>to Arouse American Aid. The Resolution States That Resolving Disputes by Military Force Is Inconsistent with the League of Nations Charter, So as Far as Shanghai Is Concerned, He Is Now Pleased to See That Many Japanese Troops Have Withdrawn. It Is Very Clear That a Fair Outcome Cannot Be Achieved Under Military Pressure, He Said.</p>
<p>▲ Unchanged Fundamental Policy Towards China. Deputy Foreign Secretary Eden Then Concluded the Debate for the Government, Saying That There Were Some Who Criticized the Government for Not Handling Things More Severely, But There Were Even More Who Supported the Government's Policy. Those Who Advocate a Strict Policy Probably Do Not Know That If Britain Were to Do This, It Might Find Itself in an Isolated Position. As for the Eastern Provinces Issue, the British Government Is Paying Attention to the Interests of the British There. The Dispute in the Eastern Provinces Has Been Going on for Nearly 30 Years, and the More the British Government</p>
<p>Studies It, the More Frightened It Becomes and Does Not Dare to Intervene in This Dispute Lightly. Therefore, It Is More Advisable to Await the Report of the League of Nations Investigation Team at This Time. There Has Been Definite Progress in Sino-British Relations in the Last Five Years, Which Is Quite Gratifying, Eden Said. Eden Believed That This Progress Was the Result of Implementing the China Policy of Former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain, Which Is to Firmly Maintain the Legitimate Interests of Britain and Other Countries and to Sympathize with the Reasonable Aspirations of the Chinese People. Eden Said This Policy Should Be Continued. During This Debate in the House of Commons, the Members of Parliament Paid Close Attention to the Speeches of Lansbury, Chamberlain, and Simon, Unlike the Previous Debate When Conservative Members of Parliament Angrily Urged Lansbury to Stop Speaking. (Reuters, London, 22nd)</p>
<p>Two Members of Parliament Confused by Japanese Propaganda. The British House of Commons Continued to Debate the Far East Situation Today. Labor Party Member MacLaren Claimed That Japan Paid as Much Attention to Australia as It Did to China. Locklan Poulson Said That China Had Failed to Protect Foreign Nationals Within Its Borders and Hoped That the British Government Would Stop Negotiating the Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction. At Today's Meeting, Another Liberal Party Member, Pickering, Defended Japan, Even Saying That If China Had Not Secretly Negotiated With Soviet Russia to Obstruct Japan, The Current Situation Would Not Have Occurred. (Translator's Note: Mr. Pickering's Words Show the Ingenuity and Effectiveness of Japanese Propaganda, Which Makes Us Know That International Propaganda in Our Country Is Urgently Needed.) (National Society, London, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Commentary Shows Unfavorable to Us</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd. The Morning Post Published an Editorial Commenting on the House of Commons Debate on Far East Affairs, Saying That If the Shanghai International Settlement Wants to Avoid the Feared Infringement and Gain Peace, Then the Honest and Harmonious Cooperation Between the Powers, Including Japan, Is Essential. It Also Said That It Is Now Appropriate to Replace the Existing Chinese Courts With International Judges. The Newspaper's Intention Is That If China Is to Know That It Cannot Use One Country to Resist Another, This Is the First Step Towards Reform, It Said. The Manchester Guide Said That Sir Simon's Speech Has Made the Shanghai Case Slightly Clear, But It Is Very Little for Manchuria and Can Be Said to Be Absolutely None, It Said. The Daily Telegraph Heard a Special Discussion of Chamberlain's Remarks and His Powerful Statement That China Had Long Disregarded Treaty Rights. The Chronicle Reported That We Are Reasonably Satisfied With Sir Simon's Remarks, But the Daily Guide's Opinion Is Different, Saying That Sir Simon Clearly Believes That If There Is a Conflict Between the League of Nations and Japan's Actions, Then the Fault Lies With the League of Nations Charter. Peeking at the Foreign Secretary's Intention, He Seems to Want to Close His Eyes to All Unpleasant Facts.</p>
<h3>Japan Welcomes Simon's Remarks</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 23rd. Japanese Newspapers Have Not Yet Commented on the Speech Delivered by British Foreign Secretary Sir Simon in the House of Commons, But Individuals Have Greatly Welcomed the Part Opposing the Adoption of Disciplinary Measures by the League of Nations and Advocating That the League of Nations' Threatening and Conciliatory Sanctions Should Be Clearly Distinguished. Japan's Criticism of the League of Nations and the United States Focuses More on Their Desire to Treat Japan as a Teacher and to Treat Japan as a Stubborn Student.</p>
<p>National Government Advisor Lin Baik</p>
<h3>Speech on the Situation in China</h3>
<p>National Society, Washington, 22nd. Today, Lin Baik, Advisor to the National Government of China, Spoke at a Meeting of the American University's Far East Incident Society, Claiming That Today's World All Hopes That China Will Have Achievements Beyond Human Power. To Build a Strong Central Government, He Then Explained the Autonomous Nature of China's Provinces and the Historical Background That Created This Situation to See the Non-Viability of a Strong Central Government. According to Today's Meeting, More Than 2,000 People Who Are Usually Concerned About the Pacific Region Attended. Government Officials, Diplomats, Lawyers, Journalists, University Professors, Members of Congress, and Leaders of Cultural Organizations All Came Together. Today Was the Second Day of the Two-Day Meeting, and After Each Celebrity Speech, There Was a Follow-Up Casual Discussion, Which Focused on the Various Problems Caused by the Sino-Japanese Hostilities, Among Which There Was No Lack of Those Who Favored Japan. The Organization of the Society Was Jointly Handled by the American University and the Lawyer and Banker Bossley. Mr. Bossley Previously Organized Similar Societies at Various Universities on Other Issues and Donated Funds to Harvard University and Yale University to Establish Scholarships for the Study of International Law and International Events.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Crisis Is Getting Worse</h3>
<p>Internal Strife in the Seiyukai. Cabinet in Turmoil</p>
<p>Budget Increase for Military Expenses Passed by the House of Representatives</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 23rd. The Infighting Between the Suzuki and Kuhara Factions of the Seiyukai Over the Cabinet Reorganization Issue Is Intensifying. Okazaki, Mochizuki, Yamamoto, Mito, Maeda, Ogawa, etc., Representing the Old Forces of the Seiyukai, and the Intermediate Forces Faction Are Also Involved. Repeatedly Making Important Remarks to the Prime Minister, the Atmosphere Within the Party Is Very Dangerous. The Suzuki Faction Is Not Satisfied With the Prime Minister's Compromising Attitude. How the Prime Minister Decides in the Future Will Have a Tremendous Impact on the Fate of the Cabinet.</p>
<p>▲ Japan United Press, Tokyo, 23rd. Seiyukai Secretary-General Mori Was Very Angry Because He Disagreed With Foreign Minister Yoshizawa on the Recent Issue of Diplomacy With China and Because the Prime Minister's Suggestions on Diplomatic Policy Were Not Accepted. He Expressed His Intention to Resign to the Prime Minister at 10:00 AM This Morning.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 23rd. The House of Representatives Met at 1:00 PM Yesterday Afternoon to Submit the Budget Bill on Military Expenses for Shanghai and Manchuria and the Public Debt Issuance Bill. After Prime Minister Inukai, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa, Army Minister Araki, Navy Minister Osumi, Finance Minister Takahashi, and Others Spoke in Order, the Opposition Parties Asked Questions on Military, Diplomatic, and Financial Affairs. The Military Expense Budget Bill Was Immediately Approved. The Post-Event Ratification Bill and the Debt Issuance Bill Were Decided to Be Reviewed by the Committee. The Minseito Listed Saito and Tanaka to Address the Problem of Citizenship and Made an Emergency Question, Citing the Toranomon Incident (Japanese Nanba Daisuke's Assassination of the Japanese Emperor) and the Kotoku Incident (Japanese Kotoku Shusui's Plot to Revolution), Impeaching the Prime Minister. The Session Was Then Adjourned. Both Committees Were in Chaos and the Faction Negotiation Conference Also Broke Down.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 23rd. The House of Representatives Continued to Meet at 1:30 PM This Afternoon. The Government Proposed the Public Debt Issuance Bill on the Expenses of the Manchuria Case, Which Was Finally Approved by a Majority Vote.</p>
<p>The Dispute Between Britain and Ireland Resumes</p>
<h3>Opposition to Oath-Taking and Suspension of Land Payments</h3>
<p>South Irish Government Issues a Statement</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 22nd: The Overseas Dominion Secretary, Thomas, stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that after arriving in the House, he received a letter from the South Irish Free State's representative in London, which was related to the South Irish situation and was extremely important. He was not yet prepared to announce its contents, but he might formally reply tomorrow. The situation was serious, and he wanted the House to be aware of it. After this statement, there was a pessimistic sentiment in the House that the Anglo-Irish dispute was about to erupt again. Soon after, Thomas handed the letter from the South Irish representative in England to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Chamberlain, and the Colonial Secretary, Lister, for their review and discussion. The South Irish representative issued a statement today, saying that he had informed Thomas of the South Irish government's policy on oath-taking. The British government must know that if restrictions of this nature prevent the South Irish people from expressing their complete and free opinions in their parliament, then true peace in South Ireland is impossible. The South Irish government believes that the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 did not stipulate oath-taking as an absolute obligation, and the government has the right to amend the constitution according to the wishes of its people. All matters relating to constitutional changes are internal sovereignty and purely internal affairs. The South Irish people all recognize the oath as a relic of the Middle Ages and an external threat under the imminent threat of war. Therefore, they consider it an unacceptable burden. People in the South Irish capital are quite surprised that a crisis has occurred so soon after the election. Although the content of the South Irish letter has not been made public, it is widely believed that the new leader of the South Irish government, Valera, has effectively announced a cabinet decision to suspend land payments. It is understood that this payment is due in the second half of June, amounting to three million pounds per year. The British government previously proposed the South Irish Land Purchase Act, which was passed by Parliament to facilitate the purchase of land by South Irish tenants. The so-called land payments come from this and were funded by issuing bonds and raising land prices, with the British government guaranteeing interest. Valera stated in the Senate this afternoon regarding the oath, that the government has no choice but to implement it. The government's attitude is friendly towards Britain, and the government wants to avoid the resurgence of hatred, but it cannot fulfill its obligations to its people. People in London expect the House of Commons to have a temporary debate on the South Irish letter tomorrow. The cabinet will consider this matter tomorrow morning, after which Thomas will speak in the House. The Conservative Party now advocates that if land payments are not received, South Irish agricultural products and livestock taxes should be increased to compensate for the loss, as South Irish exports to Britain account for nineteen tenths of the total.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>US Concerned About the Philippines</h3>
<p>Becoming a Second Manchuria</p>
<p>Propaganda from Japanese Newspapers</p>
<p>Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun reports that due to the stimulation of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the independence movement in the Philippines has suddenly increased. Therefore, the US and Philippine authorities are paying particular attention to the Japanese residing on the islands. It is reported that there are 14,000 Japanese on Davao Island in the southern part of Mindanao. Since the Manchurian Incident</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>the Philippines' well-known newspapers have been constantly warning the authorities to strictly prevent the activities of the Japanese, saying that the continuous immigration of Japanese to the Philippine islands and the expansion of huge capital investments will inevitably lead to the Japanese using the excuse of protecting their interests to turn the Philippine islands into a second Manchuria. Recently, US Colonel Theodore Roosevelt arrived in the Philippine islands and, together with the acting governor of the southern islands, Butler, inspected various places and delivered speeches attacking the Philippine authorities for not resisting Japanese colonization.</p>
<p>Shanghai and New York Ports</p>
<h3>Sales of Japanese Goods Will Be Cut Off</h3>
<p>Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reports that according to a report from the Shanghai Yokotake Commercial Counselor, due to the incident, foreign trade in Shanghai port in January and February saw Japanese goods completely wiped out. Even trade with other countries has plummeted. It is reported that imports in January this year were only 30% of last year, and exports were about 60%. In February, imports were 16% and exports were 13%, compared to 36% and 28% in the same period last year, a similar decrease. Therefore, China itself is also greatly affected in terms of customs revenue. Only Nagasaki's large-volume aquatic products, agricultural products, fruits, vegetables, seafood, canned food, and soap must change their sales routes. Industry peers in the city are preparing to send personnel to Dalian, Fengtian, Changchun, Harbin and other places to promote their products. On the other hand, as the Shanghai incident has finally subsided, Yokoyama, the chief of the Industrial Promotion Section, and Matsumoto, Shimauchi, Kawaguchi, and Suzuki, all city council members, have already made a special trip to Shanghai on the 18th of this month to inspect business conditions.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reports that according to a telegram from the New York Commercial Secretary, Shutō, Japanese goods have recently been ignored in New York. Among them, ceramics, silk, hatbands, buttons, canned food, toys, and other sundries have been completely cut off from sales. Only essential raw materials such as fur, camphor, peppermint, vegetable oil, and agar-agar are relatively active due to low exchange rates. However, the US Congress is currently planning to impose surcharges on Japanese goods, so the sales of ordinary goods will be hit again in the future.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu Counties</p>
<h3>Joint Defense and Self-Defense Along the Yangtze River and Coast</h3>
<p>The Defense Along the Yangtze River is Now Extremely Solid</p>
<p>Nantong Communication: The Jiangsu Provincial Government Security Office believes that Nantong, Haimen, Qidong and other counties are located in a strategic area along the Yangtze River and the coast, controlling the Huai River and guarding against the invasion of the Yangtze River. Therefore, defense is extremely important. The central government has already transferred the [illegible] Route Army, [illegible] Division, to Jingjiang to assist in the defense of the Jiangyin Fortress. In addition, the main force has been transferred from Qingjiangpu to Nantong to be stationed there. Therefore, on the 16th, the office specifically telegraphed the county heads of each county to immediately discuss joint defense and self-defense measures along the Yangtze River and the coast to solidify the defenses along the Yangtze River and the coast. After receiving the order, each county formed a Defense Committee on the 18th and sent the county's self-defense corps and police to the Yangtze River to assist the stationed troops in guarding against invasion. On the same day, each district extracted [illegible] reserve soldiers to maintain local security.</p>
<p>Liang Guanying telegraphed the counties of Tongzhou and Yangzhou to quickly install military long-distance telephones. The Construction Department has already telegraphed that the existing telephones between Tongzhou and Yangzhou should be temporarily used for military purposes, or military telephone lines should be borrowed and hung on existing telephone poles to facilitate military operations.</p>
<p>On the 19th, Nantong Fourth Prison received an order to release all 103 prisoners from prison who met the regulations for parole in the martial law zone. They will be summoned back for execution after the situation is stabilized.</p>
<p>Recently, in the Northern Jiangsu area, there have been traitors transporting grain and vegetables to supply the enemy, and being lured by enemy profits to cause trouble in various places. These people all enter and exit through remote small ports. The pacification army stationed in Northern Jiangsu, together with the various teams of the Fourth District of the stationed Nantong Water Police Force, are strictly arresting them, and all remote small ports have been temporarily blocked.</p>
<p>People from All Walks of Life in Chongqing Request</p>
<h3>Liu Xiang to Send Troops to Save the Nation</h3>
<p>Liu Has Agreed to Issue a Mobilization Order</p>
<p>Ba County Communication: A total of 122 organizations, including institutions, legal entities, schools at all levels, and businesses in Ba County and Chongqing, petitioned the 21st Army Headquarters on the 16th to send troops to save the nation. At 9 o'clock that day, all the organizations gathered in the empty field in front of the Provincial Command Committee and the Ba County Government, with more than 30,000 people. They held a meeting in the auditorium of the Provincial Command Committee. First, Mao Yanzhi was elected as the temporary chairman, and Zhao Qinfeng, Tang Ruolan, Li Guangdai, Liu Ziru, Huang Cixian, Zhong Qingyun, Wang Yunsong, Luo Junfu, Mao Yanzhi, Sun Hui, and others were selected as speaking representatives. Feng Junyi was the general commander, and Shen Shijin was the deputy commander. Immediately, the petition conditions were discussed and decided: 1. Request Supervisor Liu to execute the powers of the commander of the general reserve team; 2. Request Supervisor Liu to have the [illegible] army of the directly subordinate troops take the lead and depart on a scheduled date; 3. In addition to requesting Supervisor Liu to send troops on a scheduled date, the conference also telegraphed Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang to obey the orders of Commander Liu. If each division does not obey orders and still adheres to territorialism, they will be public enemies of the people. The conference will immediately telegraph the people of each county within the garrison area to unanimously strike against the market and resist taxes, and issue a nationwide announcement of their crimes; 4. If the petition is not achieved today, all attendees will lie on the ground, stop eating, and refuse to leave; 5. The order of departure today is: first column, female students; second column, male students; third column, workers' organizations; fourth column, merchant organizations; fifth column, gentlemen of the French institutions; 6. A representative should be selected from each primary school student to participate and need not march with the team. After the resolution, they marched to the Army Headquarters. When they arrived at the Army Headquarters, Supervisor Liu first met with the speaking representatives. The representatives stated the reasons for the petition, and Supervisor Liu answered them one by one. Then, he accompanied the representatives outside and announced the decision to mobilize to the people, briefly stating that since he had been appointed by the Central Government as the commander of the general reserve team, he had considered the complex situation in Sichuan overnight. Yesterday, he had issued orders to assign [illegible] army to draw [illegible] divisions, [illegible] army to draw [illegible] divisions, and Yang Sen's troops were prepared to await orders. As for the directly subordinate [illegible] army, he would send Division Commander Wang Fangzhou as the column commander to lead [illegible] divisions to [illegible] to await orders, as the vanguard of the various armies. Now Division Commander Wang is in [illegible] and has telegraphed to return to Sichuan within a specified time to lead the various divisions assigned and immediately go to [illegible]. All the orders will be announced within the next few days, without waiting for people from all walks of life to come here to petition, to comfort the public's expectations. However, at this point of national crisis, I hope that all the people will work together, embrace great sacrifices, and fight together to seek victory in the struggle and seek survival through sacrifice. I hope that all sectors will sincerely unite as the government's backing. Finally, the representative made a reply, expressing satisfaction. It is reported that the various institutions, legal entities, and schools will hold a large farewell meeting within the next few days and telegraphed Deng, Tian, Liu, and Yang to obey orders and depart within a specified time.</p>
<h3>The Process of Taking Over the Zhengtai Railway</h3>
<p>The Sino-French Contract for the Railway Has Expired</p>
<p>The Takeover Will Be Completed in About a Month</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: The Zhengtai Railway was built in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty with borrowed French funds. Now the funds have been repaid, and the 30-year term has also expired. Therefore, the Ministry of Railways has approved the recovery of the railway and has organized a takeover committee within the ministry, appointing Huang Zhensheng as the chairman of the committee and Li Shiyang, director of the Zhengtai Railway Administration, as the takeover commissioner. The takeover began on the 1st of this month. Now, Li Shiyang needs to report and ask for instructions from the Minister of Railways due to a matter. He took the train to Beijing via Jinan on the 15th. According to what Li told reporters when passing through Jinan Station regarding the takeover process, the Zhengtai Railway was built with borrowed French funds. The original loan contract stipulated that if China could repay the loan after 30 years, the railway could be redeemed. The copy stipulated that if China could repay the loan within 10 years, the contract could be voided. In addition, there is another traffic contract stipulating that the right to traffic management belongs to the creditor, France. There are many roads built in China with borrowed funds, but the conditions are harsh and the loss of rights is greater than this. However, the contract has been clearly stated that if our country can repay the loan within 10 years, it can be recovered. During the European War, the railway had a surplus of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, but the government did not know to recover it in time, resulting in a missed opportunity, which is extremely regrettable. Last year, when Sun Zhe was the Minister of Railways, I was working on the Yuehan Railway. At that time, I suggested that the Zhengtai Railway's debt had been repaid, and the term had expired, so it should be recovered on time to complete our country's railway system. Minister Sun accepted my words and appointed me as the Director of the Zhengtai Railway Administration to handle this matter. Before it could proceed, a political upheaval broke out, and Minister Sun resigned, so it was shelved. Later, when Ye Yuhu succeeded as the Minister of Railways, he also regarded the takeover of the Zhengtai Railway as an essential move and decided to continue organizing the takeover committee and appointed Huang Zhensheng as the chairman of the committee and me as the commissioner. Therefore, we went from Shanghai to Beijing to Zhengding. As I was the director, I was responsible for the takeover government affairs, and Huang Zhensheng was responsible for diplomacy, and the result of the contact with the French Chief Engineer was extremely satisfactory. The inventory began on the 1st of this month, even during the outbreak of the Shanghai case and the serious national crisis, it was not affected. Previously, all circles in Taiyuan organized the Zhengtai Railway Takeover Promotion Association. When I arrived in Shanxi to contact them, I met with Yan Xishan, the Pacification Director of Shanxi. (Mr. Yan expressed his approval of my takeover of the Zhengtai Railway. The people of Shanxi also cared very much because two-thirds of the line was within Shanxi, and they also advocated adding extension lines. However, because the Zhengtai Railway only received tens of thousands of yuan per month, the construction of extension lines was not talked about for a while. Now that the national crisis is in the middle, the takeover ceremony will be postponed. The takeover period is scheduled for one month, but because there are many urgent matters, it may not be completed as scheduled in one month. Therefore, I and others went to Beijing to ask Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways for instructions and report on the progress of the takeover. In addition, the legal representative of the railway, Malton, was recalled by telegram and returned to Beijing with Chen Yangjie, the takeover commissioner of the railway. When Chen passed through Jinan, he also told reporters that the Zhengtai Railway is currently being inventoried. Because the 30-year accounts need time to be checked, the takeover cannot be implemented yet. The equipment of the Zhengtai Railway is perfect and is the best in the country. Ordinary machines and steel rails can be self-made, and the vehicles and locomotives are also very sufficient. The annual operating income is 5 million yuan, and the surplus is 2.4 million yuan. The company has more than 2,700 employees and more than a dozen legal representatives. The reason why the railway's performance is so good is that 1. The road is a narrow gauge, and vehicles cannot flow into other roads, and it has not been affected by the wars over the years. 2. The legal representative manages the road very seriously. The Ministry of Railways specially telegraphed the French Chief Engineer to Beijing to inquire about everything in person for the purpose of negotiating the takeover. The chairman of the takeover committee, Huang Zhensheng, is still in Shijiazhuang, supervising the takeover matters.</p>
<p>Guangdong Army</p>
<h3>Huang Renhuan's Division Enters Fujian to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Zhong Shaokui's Brigade Has Recaptured Wuping</p>
<p>Shantou Communication: Shanghang and Wuping on the Fujian-Jiangxi border were recently invaded by Jiangxi bandits. The newly編independent 1st旅 brigade, Zhong Shaokui's troops, stationed there, retreated immediately. The brigade's deputy brigade commander and園長 director, Zhong Guanxun, and battalion commander Li Peiqiong, were seriously injured and transported to the Chao'an Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Upon hearing the news, the Guangdong side dispatched a team to provide assistance. The Guangdong army's Ouyang Xin unit first fought with the bandits in Yanqian, Wuping, and then defeated the bandits and advanced to Yanqian Fenshui'ao and other places. Ye Shouyao's regiment was deployed in Shipu Hutousha Yangmen area of Dapu. Xie Zheng and Chen Fengzhao, two regiments stationed in Meixian, also strengthened the defense of the Guangdong border. After Zhong Shaokui's troops lost Shanghang and Wuping, they moved to Fengshi, Zhongkeng, and Nanshedu, and sent staff Zhang Yinshi to Chaozhou and Shantou to request aid and ammunition from Li Yangjing. Li allocated 50,000 rounds of ammunition and ordered them to recover the lost territory as soon as possible. As for the Jiangxi bandits, they once invaded Hongshan Temple from Wuping Shanghang. The place is only 30 li from Fengshi, so the merchants in Fengshi specifically telegraphed Chaozhou and Shantou to stop paying for goods, and requested that Chen Rongguang, the chief of the Fengshi Public Security Bureau, be reinstated to protect the merchants of Fujian and Guangdong. Chen has gathered hundreds of old business protection teams and扎 stationed them in Hongshan Temple and Nakamur. Since the Zhong brigade has received assistance from the Guangdong army, Huang Renhuan's division has also arrived in Jiaoling Meixian and completed its concentration. Huang will enter Fujian during the day to cooperate with Zhang Zhen's troops to suppress the bandits. Therefore, the brigade first launched on the 14th and launched a general offensive against Wuping. They had already recaptured the city of Wuping that evening. Huang Renhuan is now rushing to enter Fujian to command Zhong's brigade and the militia on the Fujian-Jiangxi border in order to清 clear the atmosphere of Changting and Ruijin in the shortest possible time.</p>
