<p>時評</p>
<h3>左右辨　彬</h3>
<p>今人評人恒曰某也「左。」某也「右。」或以此互相標榜或以互相攻擊。或更以此爲中傷之工具。近數年來。青年之死於「右」者不知凡幾。死於「左」者更不知凡幾。曰左曰右。漫無標準。左右之眞實意義旣泯。而「左」「右」乃完全成爲中傷與攻擊之專門名詞。故吾人不得不以一語明辨。</p>
<p>夫所謂。「左」「右。」亦猶是非兩字之徒爲一抽象。名詞耳。嘗有人曰。「革命的向左去」。是則所謂左者。應即表示「革命」之意矣。實則此不過政黨政治家用作宣傳之術語耳。自我人民視。之則無所謂「左。」亦無所謂「右。」但知「事實」。但知以事實爲根據。而判别其是否適合大多數人民之要求。是否爲代表多數人民之利益。適合人民之要求眞能代表人民之利益者。即爲人民所擁護。否則即爲人民所反對故脫主張而有左右。思想而有左右。行動而有左右。則其眞實意義。及其眞實之區分。應在於是。脫捨此立塲。而徒肆其利口漫作批評。曰某也「左。」某也「右。」某種主張也「左。」某種主張也。「右。」是則其本身根本不知「左」「右」爲何意義。作何解釋。徒爲無意識之狂呌耳。</p>
<p>吾人旣已瞭然於左右之眞實意義矣。則對於思想之左者。主張之左者。行動之左者。換言之即其眞足以代表大多數人民之利益者。其爲反對乎。抑爲擁護乎。如曰反對。則即無異於反對大衆之福利。即無異置自身於大衆敵對之營壘。吾人果容許置身於大衆敵對之地位耶。故吾人敢斷言。凡能辨明。左君之眞實意義者。當能明白確定其對於左右之擁護或反對。斷不至視「左」爲洪水。爲猛獸爲不可親近。而肆力反對。如明曉其意義而秘予以反對者。則必其個人之利益與大衆之利益相衝突。而所謂反對者。實即一種「鬥爭」耳。抑尤有進者。無論思想主張之爲左爲右。必有其産生之背景。决非由於某個人或某一部分。人偶然之感覺。時代爲動的。進化的。决不長停於一固定之階段。思想爲經濟之上層建築物。經濟而發生劇烈之變化。則其上層建築物。亦必顯呈突變。此皆必然之理。故時代旣不可以少數人之力而推進。亦不可以少數人之力而阻遏。時代思潮。旣不以少數人之偶然感覺而産生。亦不以少數人之反對而消滅。即以人類社會近史而言。由君主專制而爲今日之德謨克拉西。蓋亦有其必然。故雖經歷長時之爭鬥而卒底於成功。以昔例今。則今日社會主義思想之流行。又豈然。又豈高壓反對所可遏制。西歐各國對於任何主義。任何思想。皆可公開討論而不加反對。誠以時代思潮之來。洶湧澎湃。絶非任何權威任何勢力所可阻止。如必欲加以阻力。行見其自身終將爲時代之洪流所捲没耳。</p>
<p>輿論無左右。但有是非。但當基於大衆之立塲。站於時代之前面。爲時代之先導者而不應爲時代之追逐者。此吾人在今日所應切實認清者也。</p>
<h3>國聨展緩召集公開會議</h3>
<p>特委會通過之議案</p>
<p>中國雖已表示接受</p>
<p>因恐日本堅决反對</p>
<p>仍密商新折衷辦法</p>
<p>國民社二十日日内瓦電云、中國總代表顔惠慶已訪國聨大會十九國委員會主席希孟、通知中國正式接受委員會决議案草案、但日本總代表佐藤今日表示、據東京消息、渠或將拒絶該决議案、故此間穩健份子、現信各小國雖亟欲舉行公開會議、委員會仍將繼續秘密工作、期可再得一新折衷辦法、能使各方滿意、因若遽開公開會議、設以日人拒絶接受而毫無結果、勢必重行召集國聨大會、屆時定將有根據國聨盟約第四欵與十五欵之動議、迫國聨大會準備一種建議、其結局或致使本退出國聨、故國聨要人雖受小國之督促、仍不肯輕率召集公開會議、將决議案遽付表决云、</p>
<p>路透社二十日日内瓦電云、中國已接受特委會所通過應付上海時局之議案、今後如何、將視日本復文而定、國聨大會議長希孟、力勸日代表長岡依允此議案、但長岡不允贊同將談判由上海移至日内瓦之任何辦法、惟已電致東京請示、特委會之議案、規定上海混合委員會得决定何時狀况可使日軍撤退、日本所反對者、即在此條規定、</p>
<p>電通社二十一日東京電云、日外省對日内瓦長岡首席代表之請訓、芳澤外相於昨日下午、開外務省首腦部會議、協議結果、對十九國委員會决議案之内容、認爲不將問題正當解釋、誠屬誤謬、已意見一致、於昨夜對長岡代表發出回訓謂、十九國委員會之决議案第七第八第十一第十二第十三等條、尤其第八條及第十一條、全出誤謬、日政府不能同意、且有礙上海停戰會議之進行、并指摘有誘致决裂之危機、日政府對該次議案、不能完全同意、且以適當之方法通告、并傳達日政府盼望十九國委員爲深甚之考慮云、</p>
<h3>停戰會議有待</h3>
<p>國聨决議草案</p>
<p>我雖正式接受</p>
<p>日尚强硬反對</p>
<p>關於國聨十九人委員會所通過之决議草案、外部當局、已於前日深晚十二時、通知滬會代表外次郭泰祺氏、謂國府當局、業已正式訓令國聨顔代表、接受該項决議、至草案全文、外部已於昨晨航郵寄滬、惟以翻譯費時、故迄至昨晚尚未公佈、定今日正式發表、</p>
<p>滬會進行尚早　外部發言人、昨日表示、停戰會議、何日繼續舉行、政府方面、初無回訓到達、此時尚難决定、外傳黄參謀長郭秘書等連日往英領署、秘秘密舉行小組會議、實屬不確、郭秘書訪問英參贊、係屬通知日軍屢次偷渡蘇州河、希圖造成蘇州河南岸之恐慌、請各友邦代表加以注意、並無舉行會議之說、小組會議、前經决定請示雙方總代表、故在正式會議未經繼續討論之前、小組會議、殊難先行召集也云、</p>
<p>郭泰祺氏談話　華東社記者昨訪郭泰祺氏、郭謂、國聨决議、中央方面、業經訓令顔代表接受、我國自始至終、對國聨决議、均屬接受、此次實無足異、國聨决議草案之内容、對日軍撤退、認爲一待情勢許可、即須完全撤退、並無待平常狀態恢復等字樣、須知所謂平常狀態、係屬政治問題、國聨焉能自與三月四日决議相抵觸、此項决議、雖未能令人充分滿意、但吾爲尊重國聨計、勉强加以接受、惟日方忽强硬反對、故前途尚頗可慮、日方反對之原因安在、外間殊難得悉、以意度之、或以决議草案内授權列强組織混合委員會、决定日軍撤退之時機一點、日方以爲有第三國干涉之嫌、與其宗旨相反、故决然加以拒絶耳云、</p>
<p>美使昨未來滬美使詹森、於日前僟其夫人、乘機晋京公幹、本定昨晨返滬、惟昨日下午、航空公司消息、謂美使昨日並未搭機返滬云、</p>
<h3>郭建華述被捕脫險經過</h3>

<h3>捷發輪船觸礁失事</h3>
<p>日人船主肇禍</p>
<p>損失六七十萬</p>
<p>營口致遠公司捷發號輪船、由滬運貨、開赴龍口、行至渤海、日人船主駕駛不愼、致觸暗礁、船身毁壞、全船華海員等、亦幾頻于危、船貨兩項損失至巨、亟將此事詳情、查誌如下、</p>
<p>戰時華員遇險　該輪載重四千噸、專航日本朝鮮及上海南北洋各埠、船内高級船員、船主大二副大二車、盡用日人充當、下級船員與水手、則爲華人、</p>
<p>青島卸貨失愼、此次自大連開來上海至德干古碼頭、代裝火油硫磺及軋士林汽車、往青島龍口卸、十二日先到青島起、出卸一部貨物、再往龍口、詎甫抵青島碼頭工人有紙烟火星、遺入硫磺内、突然起火、來勢甚劇、幸在碼頭、竭力施救、得以撲滅、惟船身已經損壞一部、</p>
<p>觸入桑島暗礁　從青島開出後、至十三號下午四時四十分、行至渤海中起母島海面、其時天氣清明、又無風浪、值班日人船主、以駕駛不愼、致將船身觸入長山島與起母島中間桑島暗礁石上、當時觸撞極猛、震動全船、而頭艙竟擱進礁石、輪底鐵板、立時破裂、海水冲進船内、</p>
<p>風浪打破船身　失事後、船主發電求救、迄無船隻往援、延至十四日、海面忽起大風浪、將該輪船顚簸、船身與礁石亂撞、霎時船底完全破毁、機艙間亦進水、爐鍋火熄、行將沉没、全船華人船員水手、祗得各穿救命衣、準備落海溧流、聽諸天命、</p>
<p>船、遇救苦慘　大連方面、先來一回電、謂救護輪即將開來、詎料十四十五兩天、久待不至、延至十六號早晨、方始開到救護小輪船圓島丸一艘、差幸是時風濤漸息、落水船員水手、經二日三夜之危險幸未傷亡、及至救上小輪、已各狼狽不堪矣、</p>
<p>貨船損失一斑、捷發輪中汽油火油硫磺等着水後、完全損失一空、船身亦破壞無底、因擱在礁上、猶未沉没、但已無法打撈、總計貨物與船舶、其損失至少在六七十萬元、船員水手行李衣服、亦完全失去、查此次朱事、係由日人駕駛不愼錯誤航線所致、而肇禍後、日人船員更視若無事、並不設法救護各人、被難各華員、已報告公司矣、</p>

<p>寳山路口守岡所墻頭、及北站豎立廣告牌、槍砲　密如蜂窩、其出口處鐵栅門、及北浙江路底豐裕里鐵栅門、均被砲彈炸斷總柱、至堪驚人、弄内門户、槍砲穴纍纍、升順里門樓、連墻垣皆被打燬、車站房屋、完全空洞、僅留墻垣高聳而已、其西面一帶棧房全燬、碎瓦頽垣、焦木爛鐵、雜亂縱横、毁殘貨物、遍地觸目、遥望鐵軌中、尚有車輛十數節、而無軍頭、見其玻窗及旁板、類率損壞、</p>
<p>沿界路商舖、昨日上午、已有上海銀行·交通學行·中華捷運公司·北站郵局·曁各大小店舖、紛紛從事整理内部、搬回器具或貨物、似有從事開業狀態、惟各弄内居民、固早有、遷回者、然未遷回者亦屬不少、故愛爾近路小菜塲、每晨購物者、亦屬寥寥無幾、可見多數尚未搬回也、又北浙江路迤西一帶、如華興坊等處、鐵網依舊存在、恐不見卸除耳、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯二十日里加電、由近數日蘇俄各報社論、及行抵里加之旅客言論觀之、足見莫斯科對於其與日本可以發生重大糾紛一層、日益注意、最顯著者、即蘇俄報紙以前僅攻擊日本之詭譎、指責白俄受日本之利用、從事挑釁、並爲一切犯罪行爲、各報紙每遇機會、必標榜蘇俄之和平思想、蘇俄報界對日之態度、以前不過如此、而現在則一變其論調、謂蘇俄决不任其領土被人侵略、一遇必要時、對於侵略者必出以堅决之抵抗、大約蘇俄預科將來爲勢所迫、或有不能不讓步之一日、目下所以採此態度者、正爲先發制人之計、使日後雖讓步、亦不致過於犧牲耳、現在莫斯科渴望美國之援助、故竭力利用美日兩國遠東利益之衝突、以期得到美國之合作、此意吾人瀏覽蘇俄報紙即可見之、</p>

<h3>建築蕭德路之提議</h3>
<p>伯涵</p>
<p>美國飛行家蕭德。此次爲愛護世界和平。憤然投袂而起。與日機鬥於金　之空中。卒以衆寡不敵。星隕於野我政府爲表示崇德報功之意。特商之於蕭母。公葬蕭德遺體於滬濱虹橋。而蕭母且爲此事。遠涉重洋。躬與盛典。於是太平洋東西兩岸。對峙遥企之二大共和國。行見陸誼永敦。邦次益輯。惟查華美兩國。精神與物質上之提携固不自今日始。證諸史乘。斑斑可考。並查上海一隅所有街道名稱。大抵多以與中國歷史有關之人物名之。其間有功於我國者尤指不勝屈。我人苟能於行路時。稍稍顧名思義。當有不少令人景仰或感慨之前人在。如蘭路如赫德路。如司高塔路。如愛而近等。皆代表一近代之西僑。各有其事蹟可稽。再則如在我中華。立有軍事之殊勳者。復有戈登Ｍajor　Gordon與華德Ｇeneral　Wardo一英一美。俱炳耀於我史乘。其中尤以華德之事蹟對彰著。查華德率長勝軍數千健兒。轉戰東南。底定滬瀆。後卒殉難於松江。京師傳令褒奬。並爲立祠。春秋祭掃。以碧眼黄髯之外人。而受我華夏之祭祀者。僅華德一人耳。惟念華德戈登輩。受滿人之豢養而平洪楊。猶是以華人殺華人。何如蕭德憤暴日之猖狂。悲無辜之荼毒。振臂而起。奮不顧身。以中立國之人民。代國際伸公義。爲世界鋤强權。其榮名豈戈華輩所可同日而語哉。今上海旣有戈登華德諸路。故鄙意應就滬西新闢之區。擇一要衢。錫以嘉名。以埀永久而示觀感。至於我國此次死事將士。亦宜逐漸增設路名。以埀不朽。</p>
<h3>記故宫寳屏　重</h3>
<p>蜀中陳一禪翁。工檜事。精鑒别。近游寓滬上。不佞昨過其居。則翁方購得故宫嵌寳屏風一事。獲觀之餘。竊喜　祚無量。爰記之以告讀者。</p>
<p>此屏共計八扇。高可九尺。寛約二尺。屏架係紫檀木所製。中鍍彫漆板。漆板上則嵌以寳石·水翠·珊瑚·彩玉等。諸寳悉鑿成物象。舉凡人·物·鳥·獸·花·草·蟲·魚。無一不備。而光澤則紅·綠·藍·紫。目迷五色。屏爲故事凡八。計有風塵三俠·蘇武牧羊·太白醉酒·捷妤賦詩·睛天浴鳧·鶯紅游園·松下問道·依馬詢樵等。諸寳悉依其色澤巨細。狀諸物之形態。極巧匠之能事。尤以太白醉酒之太白。松下問道之高僧。一則醉態惺忪。一則道貌岸然。而高僧之袈裟。以紅寳石爲之。維妙維肖。嘆觀止矣。</p>
<p>屏爲前清乾隆年所製。本藏禁中。後高宗以賜其師傅劉某。此物遂傳至民間。近劉某家人。運來滬上。禪翁遂以重金購之。物得其主。毋怪禪翁之喜形於色也。聞翁將以此屏陳諸高齋。供美術家之鑒賞。　　本刋將於四月三十日編印六十週年紀念專號一大張。希諸同文惠賜鴻著。不論遺聞軼事·掌故·小説·雜感·隨筆·插畫等。均所歡迎。每篇字數仍以五百字爲準。請於本月二十九日以前寄到。一經錄取。酬當從豐。</p>

<h3>滬戰與軍器（十六）一·藏·</h3>
<p>無人飛機。就是不用人力。祇裝置無線電駕駛飛機的意思。當一八九七年馬爾戈尼發明無線電報以後。英國物理學家魏爾生。創遺無綫電駕駛自動艇。其後因電學的進步。面目日新。漸達於實用化。不過這種飛機。現在雖未出現。但聞軍事家的消息。已研究到成功的地步了。國爲近代軍器的進步。愈出愈奇。就軍事上所用的無線電技術而言。如砲兵情的器具。偵察敵情蒐集材料的音源標定機廻轉劃機。Ｐanorama　望鏡</p>
<p>式經緯儀。各種測量機械。通信材料中的有線無線電報電話。秘密通信的不可見光線通信裝置。光電話暗號機。以及用不可見光線警戒陣地時就能發見目標。攝取烟幕霧　等透視照相器。發現僞裝。並電流　條網防空用電氣的聽測器。照空燈。與各種動力機等等。凡用電光學的應用軍　一類。不遑枚舉。譬如最近所用的高射砲。對於敵機的襲擊。在一瞬間可發多數彈丸。就是賴電力的聨動。能使觀測手在機械上計算出來。即在黑暗的夜。滿天濃霧的時候。也可籍藉空中聽音器照空燈的力觀測。加以無線電報的進步。如短波超短波高速度通信重量　信等。亦對於軍用上的電送攝影。電視裝置等。漸次發明。所以後方司令部。能利用電送照相。與電視方法。可以明瞭前方的情形。又有方向偵探機。偵察敵方通信所的配置。推知敵軍布置的狀况。因種種電光學的作用科學工藝的尖銳化。遂促進無人飛機的完成。以應時代的需求了。</p>
<h3>國仇家仇（三）　王天恨</h3>
<p>大地被黑黯與恐怖控制得更繫，心裏也自然更慌張。却不料爬行了半點鐘後，定神細辨，只呌得一聲苦，原來他行走的方向，竟和他居宅的方向漸漸相背，到了定神細辨，纔發覺越走越離他的居宅越遠，心中一急，便不由急出兩行熱涙來。再想回頭，則身子旣乏，又有莫大危險，如何可以自蹈危險，糊裏糊塗的犧牲呢！可是老母和幼子都在家裏，又怎能不冒險回去？他這時進退維谷，坐在地上流了一回涙，念到老母和幼子有亡莫卜，竟自忍不住痛哭起來！</p>
<p>但哭也無益，他省悟了，决定不顧危險，竭力忍痛，仍舊尋路回去，不料爬行多時，終於被流彈所阻；並且又錯了路，終於爬不到家；而天色也終於明亮了。</p>
<p>天明之後，四周的景象纔看得清楚，眞是慘呵！無數的慌張的逃難者，也正像夜裏的自家一樣，有的向東逃，有的又向西奔。鎗砲聲仍然在劈劈拍拍地響，而軋軋的飛機聲，却比夜裏更多，更厲害，轟然之聲，不絶於耳，四方的建築物，也就不絶地騰出濃烟而起了火，把天際反映成一大片紅色，那濃烟却像是霧，　軍着大地，自家和無數的逃難者便好似臨着世界末日，不知死所！這時他疲極了，彷彿成爲癱瘓，遥望故居，還離得很遠呢！却又遥見故居的所在地，也正是烈飛騰，這烈燄又彷彿燒到他的房，心房，心房中的痛楚，比手上面上破了皮流血的痛楚還劇烈些！</p>
<p>故居是只能遥望而不可即了！他已忍痛爬行了一夜，那裏還立得起來，的確就和癱瘓一樣，不知不覺地横臥道旁，　　的逃難者在他身旁走過，一個個好似不見，只顧自己逃命緊緊，好久好久，他纔聽得耳畔有人慌張而驚惶地的呼喚：「振中·」丨他的字丨「爸爸！」這樣地喚。他睜開了兩眼看見身旁的三人，竟不覺跳起來説：「我在夢裏麽？」</p>
<p>「你怎麽却在這裏？」他的内弟泰秦江説。一一</p>
<p>「我當做做你已丨你怎麽却睡在這裏？他母親老涙汎瀾地説。</p>
<p>「爸爸！你怎麽滿了一臉的血，又是滿臉的呢土！爸爸！」他的幼子雄兒也流着涙説。</p>
<p>「我難道不是做夢！」他定睛看他們。又説。「眞不是做夢麽？」</p>
<p>「振中！你怎麽説是夢，我多虧了秦江，把我們帶着逃出來，東躱西避，　了一夜的苦！怎麽你却不見了，是何時出來的？我竟已當你遭了不測，不料在此地遇着，這走是　　在暗中保護呵！」母親説。</p>

<h3>洋厘俏後又滯</h3>
<p>昨日洋厘早市本已俏利、價格抬昂一厘光景、爲七錢０四厘一毫二忽半、而午市以買胃又滯、故價續低、爲七錢０四厘、結果較前日早市仍好一厘、銀拆以銀根甚覺鬆動、價格持平、早午市仍爲一錢、劃頭加水七八分、銀行掛牌四分、形勢大有活躍可能、故銀行收解亦稍稍旺盛、華商收解各欵三百十餘萬、外商銀行四百六十餘萬、匯兌關稅押匯貨物各欵收解五百餘萬、結欵收解一百餘萬、觀其趨勢、大有欣欣向榮之概、又銀行洋欵買賣、早午市五十萬、各種洋户往來收解一百三十餘萬、對洋劃頭欵收解一百六十餘萬、錢莊拆票交易二百四十餘萬、銀公單收解三千四百餘萬、劃頭欵收解三百二十餘萬、洋公單收解五百十餘萬、小錢莊交易五十餘萬、客路去胃三十餘萬、市塲中滙劃票欵早午市做出九十三萬、鈔票八萬、支單七萬五千、輔幣市價、江南小洋早市爲六錢０六厘、午市爲０五厘、與前日早午市完全雷同、交易四千五百角、廣東小洋、早市爲六錢０八厘、午市爲七厘二毫半、較前日亦跌一厘七毫半、交易早市九萬角、銅元改縮一千文、爲四百十七千五百文、交易三萬七千餘串云、</p>
<p>證劵　債劵暗盤漸堅</p>
<p>成交不多···證劵有於五月二日開市説、前昨兩日、本埠華商證劵交易所各債暗盤市面、成交稀少、每日進出無多、暗盤漸漸趨堅、但趨勢已交穩定、每日盤旋、無大漲落、内以統鹽稅兩種各漲一元六七角爲較鉅、其他亦各好八九角左右、查兩日來對於期貨了結交易共九萬五千元、内鹽稅三萬元、一九關二對關各二萬元、一九善一萬五千元、統稅一萬元、又證劵次易所方面有於五月二日開市説、惟開否仍須視時局形勢之變化及財部之訓令而定云、</p>
<p>紗花　紗銷前途悲觀</p>
<p>棉紗市况、蕭條異常、各帮生意沉寂、大戰後金融停滯、各方經濟竭蹶、因之購買力大弱、而廠方之囤積日見增厚、賣價一再下跌、大有一蹶不振之勢、昨日各帮買去統計僅有二百八十包、内中同行佔一百九十包、需要之海、爲歷來所罕見、照大勢測之、紗銷一時無發展之望、查日廠工作漸次恢復、對於銷塲方面、亟謀出路、價格極其遷就、暗中進行甚力、前途殊爲悲觀也、客帮祗天津進二十五包、内地四包、廣東六十包、寗波五包、行情跌五錢至一兩半云、</p>
<h3>現棉需求幾等于無</h3>
<p>棉花市况平靜、但實需益覺凄凉、各廠以紗銷滯鈍、進意全無、申新廠連日購買甚巨、業已有飽滿之患、祗緯通廠進鄭州花一百件、價三十四兩、現貨送廠云、</p>
<h3>津市西河花下跌</h3>
<p>天津西河花、市况趨疲、且形勢衰弱、因銷路不暢、惟好貨尙堅持、因紗廠進胃比較活利、日商稍有吸進、德豐行購進五十包、開價二十七兩三錢、華新廠進五百二十八包、價爲二十七兩、北河長絨棉、恒源紗廠買進四百包、價做三十兩云、</p>
<h3>美棉有空户抵補</h3>
<p>昨美棉因賣户缺乏、利物浦消息良好、空頭抵補、市况平靜而堅、計期貨漲九至十三磅音、現貨漲十五磅音、英棉期貨跌一點、現貨漲一點、埃及棉現貨不動、印棉因投機家買進而堅、計平果爾漲零五羅比、白羅溪漲一·五羅比、原電錄左、（二十日電）</p>

<p>滬南　昨日米市尙稱活潑、各店舖存貨空虛、乘此擋口添辦存貨、黄浦江斛脚比前市爲旺、西路來信、糙粳市面形勢提緊、常錫頂粳提高殺次、蘇同帮鄉莊帮略動、故趨勢喊起角半、變陰元及早晚稻到銷二平、價無上落、</p>
<p>北市　昨日各帮來源不多、厚粳計十數號、河下船楓練等帮約有二十號、本街胃口寥寥、無錫·崑山·平望等貨、後路來源甚少、行情站定、洋杜尖小落一二角、糯米糕　舖競買、價復見硬</p>
<h3>鎭江帮問訊洋米</h3>
<p>昨日洋米仍無大帮去化、本街大户亦多觀望、故市價續小數分、昨有鎭江帮與内地客户因市價小後合對裝運、在市辦去二千包左右、高貨仍得開至十元零一角六分至一角、中次十元零五分至九元八角、本街散户亦辦去數百包、期貨進出兩少、洋行仍無抛出、囤買不肯賤脫、昨日成交回錢貨二百噸、爲小絞四月份、價仍爲四兩七錢半云、</p>
<h3>現粉廠盤放鬆</h3>
<p>昨現份市面驟見鬆軟之象、以福新廠盤、幾日前擯住不開、且非二兩一錢五分淨盤不可、因此人心帶堅、重轉好象、昨日兵船廠方已肯開出、祗須二兩一錢五分扣盤、故大部分人心、均爲之帶落、四月份現貨開價二兩一錢二分、繼小二厘半、五月份開價二兩一錢三分半、繼小五厘、較前日四月份計小七厘半、五月份則突跌二分、至廠盤之放鬆、聞洋麥又見兜售、日商三井之存貨、四兩一錢半、已願脫手、廠方還價四兩零五分、暗中活動者、又大有人在、此外賑災洋麥、近將有大批進口、數達百萬包左右、市上已有開訊、開二兩一錢當可成交、惟大多數買户、祗還二兩零五分、加出廠稅八分半、當在一錢二三分、惟有此情形、人心遂爲動摇云、</p>
<p>五金　黑頭皮市貨充斥</p>
<p>黑頭皮爲搪磁廠繁銷品、近來該帮以銀根奇緊、相繼縮小範圍、因此實銷方面、大受打擊、而到貨充斥、市存愈厚、行情因有江河日下之勢、現市二六尺祗售八兩七錢半、三六尺八兩五錢、聞開出祗有零星數目而已云、</p>
<h3>新鐵絲漢帮點綴獨旺</h3>
<p>十六號至二十五號新鐵絲交易、因出路蕭條、市象萎靡、標準難以站立、近幾日來、漢帮交易驟見興　、因此市勢轉佳、行情鞏固、計十六號至二十號每担開十三兩五錢、二十一號至二十五號開十四兩五錢、聞昨日已成出二三百桶云、</p>

<h3>歐美絲銷更無生氣</h3>
<p>昨本埠洋莊絲市、益呈疲滯、緣歐美各莊以海外華絲價一再慘跌、不敢冒險購積、華絲商亦以虧本太巨、無法抛售、絲市益無生氣、昨祗克昌進白乾經十包、伯興進黄絲九包、價仍平疲云、</p>

<h3>變相的戀愛徵求</h3>
<p>— 警愚</p>
<p>最近本報分類廣告的聘請欄内，揭着廣告一條，標題是「聘請美術敎員」略謂</p>
<p>「某君任職大學敎授，午後多暇，擬學妆步繪事，藉以陶冶性情，特徵聘青年女子美術敎員一位，時間每月二十小時，在午餐后，束修月酬二三十元」</p>
<p>夫美術之能陶冶性情，果然不錯，午餐之後，敎授之暇，從事於繪事的研求，至爲適當，因爲服務上海地方，固有的工作一完，索居旣感無趣，出游復嫌浪費，學習繪事，旣可收束身心，又能怡悅性情，本來是利用時間的一種最好方法，</p>
<p>不過敎員之資格，未免抉擇太嚴，我意祇須是美術家而有繪事經騐的，就可合選，不分性别，無論老少，男性也可，女性也可，老的也可，少的也可，奚必齗齗於唯女子是徵，更惟青年女子是徵，豈青年女子果饒美術的天才與技能，而敎法復特别優長，與衆不同嗎？然而某君尙屬初步學習，固無需此種出類拔萃的良師，凡稍具繪事智識之人，即可擔任指導，則洋塲十里中，略解丹青而能揮灑幾筆者，不知凡幾，廣告朝刋，應徵夕至，何必定以青年女子爲條件，棄易而就難呢？</p>
<p>并且陶冶性情，其道甚夥，諸如絲竹·棋枰·詩詞·碑帖之類，無一不可學習、無一不可陶冶性情，豈僅繪事乃有陶冶性情之可能，今爲陶冶其性情起見，而必學習繪事，學習繪事而必從青年女子爲導師，殆繪事一經青年女子的敎授，其性情上所獲陶冶的效果，必定倍徙人？然而寗有是理，</p>
<p>故我爲某君設想，果爲陶冶性情，因而致力繪事，訪求師資，則是項廣告，其效殆等於零，蓋眞正當於美術天才和技能的青年女子、必不肯貪茲戔戔二三十元之月薪，以屈節卑躬，俯賜敎益，反之，如肯翩然惠顧，遷就應徵的，即係了無實學之人，此理彰彰明甚，若然，則徵聘者仍難償其學問需求的願望，假使醉翁之意，原不在酒，無非想借徵聘敎員爲名，藉作戀愛進行的試騐，那末，不如直截爽快，大書特書曰「徵求女友」「徵求情侣」「徵求······」等等，光明得多，</p>

<h3>羅營長死事詩</h3>
<p>— 夢苕盦王主</p>
<p>七十八師第一團第一營羅營長坤、殉於三月一日小塲廟之役、是役日兵以全力襲我營陣地、營長殊死戰、斃敵七百、逾月事外聞、詩以哀之、</p>
<p>戰塲晝寂天死灰、頑雲壓陣陣不開、蝴蝶千羣遽飛出、（蝴蝶兵倭宼也見明史）殺聲如海排空來、九天九地火齊發、孤軍拒壁危一髮、公怒一叱萬鬼瘖、奮身殺賊先士卒、賊見公來疑飛神、仆地都成木偶人、我軍如龍敵如草、大呼陷陣山爲倒、至晨至午戰　不疲、敵軍七百皆肉糜、公力未盡槍忽折、手中剩有彈數發、裹瘡再戰甲盡紅、是心是血皆化鐵、貫日雄虹萬丈起、漢家虎將終戰死、是夕我軍鼓不揚、全師急退三十里、可憐衆寡太殊絶、不然五嶽誰能拔、戰塲刧後過者愁、　　莽蒼不可收、不知何者是公骨、天陰雨濕魂咿嘠、安得起公　　貅、往集餘燼翦我仇、側身西望徒繁憂、</p>
<h3>讀海藏樓詩感賦</h3>
<p>— 夢苕盦王</p>
<p>銅狄摩挲二十年、一麾江海杜樊川、吟邊已換人間世、猶向空林拜杜鵑、白髮藜牀夜未歸、秦庭涙滿老臣衣、烏山風月渾無恙、爲語西烏莫夜飛、</p>
<h3>勗同胞自動禦侮</h3>
<p>— 君素</p>
<p>我武惟揚撻伐張、中華民族不尋常、身肩天下安危任、要取仇頭作劍囊、男兒自昔事長征、恥作關門鷸蚌爭、殺敵非緣恩怨念、相期世界早和平、</p>
<h3>慰勞傷兵醫院</h3>

<h3>刺馬占山</h3>
<p>— 陳柱尊</p>
<p>報載僞滿國政府部長有馬占山·國人旣悲馬占山之有始無終，復恨張學良之坐視不救，爰賦是詩，三月昨日忠臣今逆賊，陵雖孤恩漢負德，一人榮辱安足論，節旣淪亡嗟可惜，黑龍江下水潺湲，似爲將軍深歎息，</p>
<h3>勉馬占山將軍</h3>

<p>去年作詩頌將軍，前日作詩罪將軍，今日作詩勉將軍，嗚呼勉哉馬將軍，自從三省來夷氛，主將以不抵抗聞，國人賤之如彘豚，天下大辱叢厥身，唯君奮臂黑江濱，血戰數月奏奇勳，萬民歌聲薄天雲，榆粟捐財何繽紛，英名赫赫中天縣，家家買絲繡平原，銅像崢嵘遍城邨，香烟聲名尤赫喧，獨立難支大厦翻，全軍整隊歸海倫，得當報漢陵志存，可憐溥儀昏復昏，甘把滿州步韓塵，君偶出入僞國門，人皆駡君豎降旛，我雖疑君難爭論，三人言市有虎蹲，作詩刺君仍疑寃，應留正氣於乾坤，今得讀君之宣方，諒哉君心有可原，日月經天物來吞，須臾光明燭八垠，世人寗得輕輊軒，願君努力恢國權，大復國仇報國恩，富貴浮雲何足云，唯有忠義爲國魂，保之國强亡則淪，我有詩筆春秋尊，大書特書中華民國五將軍，馬占山·蔡廷楷·蔣光鼐·譚啓秀·翁照垣，</p>

<h3>續烟幕彈</h3>
<p>— 捐雲</p>
<p>烟幕彈不僅可避匿以免敵人攻擊，且可借助以作軍事行動，如：偷襲，移營，代替軍令，因兵干伏於壕中，有時發令頗感不靈便，有以烟之顔色代軍令，更可使敵方認爲毒瓦斯，使戴面具，以减少敵方作戰能力，（歐戰時多以烟幕彈與毒瓦斯同時施放，使敵方不能辨認爲何種毒瓦斯，）</p>
<p>四批化錫（Ｓncl4）爲其中最普通者，在本刋曾有立君述一製法。惟尙有較立君所述更爲簡便者、（一）可由二氯化錫（Ｓncl2）加王水，商業上多用是法；結成結晶體，稱爲强錫。（二）可將錫一小塊，如注鹽酸少許（如嫌太漫，可稍熱之）另以二立方厘之三氯化鐵，加五立方厘之水，再將上項錫液，滴滴加入，至發生顔色變化爲度，即能得到白色濃厚之烟霧。其化學方式如下：</p>
<p>２Ｆecl3　Sncl2　2Fcel2　Sncl4</p>
<p>三氯化　二氯化　二氣化　四氯化</p>
<p>按四　化錫，除用爲烟霧外，常作爲媒染劑（Ｍcrdanl）故於染色工業，亦甚重要，</p>

<h3>小姐和大姐</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>因爲春風已將上海的戰雲吹開更賜給高貴的市民們以無限的温和的緣故，李家小姐今天照例的帶領着自家大姐（娘姨的後補者）由公園中懶懶地回來。</p>
<p>在一條馬路的轉角，一間小小的烟紙店前站着幾個募捐隊，這是由那旗幟便可知道的。其中有一個年青的女人是這樣向人們哀告差；　　「我們都是被日本紗廠所開除的。一天没工做便一天没飯吃。我們自己餓着到有時還可以忍受得住，可是家裏的小孩子一天到晚的哭，聽來眞是傷心·····請你們多少捐助一點，做做好事，救救性命！······」</p>
<p>這種含涙的哭聲，在我們高貴的李「千金」看來，眞是可笑得很；第一她們旣是工人，一個工人因爲國家大事而暫時没有飯吃，那算得什麽呢？······於是她只是冷笑一下便離開她們，當然募捐者之對她也只得「免開尊口」了。</p>
<p>走不多遠她却發現尾隨着自己的大姐在後面遠遠地喘着追來。這簡直值得她大發脾氣了。</p>
<p>「你爲什麽老愛和她們糾纏在一塊兒的。你這下流痞！」「不，她們太可憐了，我將所有的兩元工錢都捐給她們了。」</p>
<p>「該死的東西！」大姐的臉上滿滿地被印了一掌。「你有這麽多閒錢？以後我敎他們一個銅板也不給你！」</p>
<p>但是大姐深信：她自己是做過工的，所以只有她才懂得工人們的苦痛，小姐是大家庭的女兒，她永遠不會知道而且永遠也不想知道她們的生活，所以，這是「小姐」和「大姐」的分别了。</p>

<h3>食品救國</h3>
<p>— 陳際雲</p>
<p>自從四月一日開市以來，各界各業都有救國的表示，都是「忍痛ＸＸ，長期抵抗。」其實都借國難之名來利己而已！前天因事外出，靜悄悄地坐在電裏。我的身上忽然發現一本日曆，取而視之，才知道ＸＸＸ廣告，一種利用日曆的宣傳品。日曆上面寫着「食品救國」四個大字。我看了之後，心裏覺得這個鹟中非常熱心救國。我們民衆應該十二萬分的感謝。</p>
<p>我們知道旣稱食品，當然一定可以飽腹的。不過這種食品（時鮮果品，星期名點······）不吃也不要緊，完全是富人們的額外食物，可以説吃來玩的。</p>
<p>在這國難臨頭，一切的一切，都要抱緊縮政策。至於食品方面，最好要採一菜制，節省些金錢，購些防禦的東西。就實際有效之軍用物，爲國備辦，查我國現時最爲敵人所威迫的，就是兵艦大砲飛機，防禦敵機擲彈，尤爲目前急切之圖。我們鑒於閘北江灣吳淞等地方，日機肆虐的留痕。我們爲自衞計，爲國防計，無論此次會議成功與否，都應速籌的欵，從事防空設備。有事時，除陣地由國家防衞外，一切住户商店，都可免於敵機的踴躪了，比無需的食品裝在肚裏，終要好些。所以這種食品，反足以亡國。</p>

<h3>Left and Right Discernment　Bin</h3>
<p>Nowadays, people constantly label others as "leftist" or "rightist." Some use these terms to praise each other, while others use them to attack. Even worse, they are used as tools for slander. In recent years, countless young people have died because of being labeled "rightist," and even more have died because of being labeled "leftist." These labels are applied without any clear standard, and the true meaning of "left" and "right" has been lost. "Left" and "right" have become mere terms of abuse and specialized names for attack. Therefore, we must clarify the distinction with a single statement.</p>
<p>The so-called "left" and "right" are abstract nouns, just like the words "right" and "wrong." Someone once said, "The revolutionary goes to the left." If that is the case, then "left" should represent the meaning of "revolution." In reality, this is nothing more than a slogan used by politicians for propaganda purposes. From the perspective of our people, there is no "left" or "right." We only know "facts" and base our judgments on whether something meets the demands of the majority of the people and represents their interests. That which meets the demands of the people and truly represents their interests will be supported by the people; otherwise, it will be opposed. Therefore, whether there is "left" or "right" in a proposition, an idea, or an action, its true meaning and distinction lie in this. To abandon this position and engage in glib criticisms, calling someone "leftist" or "rightist," or calling a certain proposition "leftist" or "rightist," is to fundamentally misunderstand the meaning and interpretation of "left" and "right." It is nothing more than an unconscious, wild cry.</p>
<p>Now that we clearly understand the true meaning of "left" and "right," should we oppose or support those who are "leftist" in their ideas, propositions, or actions—in other words, those who truly represent the interests of the majority of the people? If we say we oppose them, then it is no different from opposing the welfare of the masses, and no different from placing ourselves in the camp of the people's enemies. Can we allow ourselves to be in a position opposed to the masses? Therefore, we dare to assert that anyone who can clearly discern the true meaning of "left" will be able to clearly determine their support for or opposition to "left" and "right." They will never regard "left" as a flood or a wild beast, something to be avoided and vigorously opposed. Those who understand its meaning but secretly oppose it must have their personal interests in conflict with the interests of the masses. Their so-called opposition is actually a "struggle." Furthermore, regardless of whether an idea or proposition is "left" or "right," it must have its own background. It is not due to the accidental feeling of a certain individual or a certain group of people. The times are dynamic and evolving, never stagnating at a fixed stage. Ideology is the superstructure built upon the economy. When the economy undergoes drastic changes, its superstructure must also undergo sudden changes. This is an inevitable principle. Therefore, the times cannot be advanced or resisted by the power of a few people. The trends of thought of the times are not produced by the accidental feelings of a few people, nor can they be eliminated by the opposition of a few people. Even in the recent history of human society, the transition from monarchical autocracy to today's democracy has been inevitable. Therefore, although it has gone through a long period of struggle, it has finally succeeded. Using the past as an example for the present, how can the current popularity of socialist thought be suppressed by high-pressure opposition? Western European countries allow open discussion of any doctrine or ideology without opposition, precisely because the trends of thought of the times are surging and cannot be stopped by any authority or power. If one insists on resisting it, one will eventually be engulfed by the flood of the times.</p>
<p>Public opinion has no "left" or "right," only "right" and "wrong." We must base ourselves on the position of the masses, stand at the forefront of the times, and be the guide of the times, not the follower. This is what we should clearly recognize today.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Delays Convening Public Meeting</h3>
<p>Resolution Passed by Special Committee</p>
<p>China Has Indicated Acceptance</p>
<p>Fearing Japan's Resolute Opposition</p>
<p>Secret Consultations Continue for a New Compromise</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th - Guomin News Agency: China's chief delegate, Yan Huiqing, visited the chairman of the League of Nations' Committee of Nineteen, Hymans, to inform him that China has formally accepted the draft resolution of the committee. However, Japan's chief delegate, Sato, stated today that, according to news from Tokyo, he may reject the resolution. Therefore, moderate elements here now believe that, although the small countries are eager to hold a public meeting, the committee will continue its secret work, hoping to reach a new compromise that can satisfy all parties. If a public meeting is hastily convened and the Japanese refuse to accept it, resulting in no outcome, the League of Nations Assembly would have to be reconvened. At that time, motions would be made based on Articles 4 and 15 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, forcing the League of Nations Assembly to prepare a recommendation, which could lead to Japan withdrawing from the League of Nations. Therefore, key figures in the League of Nations, although urged by the small countries, are unwilling to rashly convene a public meeting and hastily put the resolution to a vote.</p>
<p>Geneva, 20th - Reuters: China has accepted the special committee's resolution on the Shanghai situation. What happens next will depend on Japan's response. The president of the League of Nations Assembly, Hymans, strongly urged the Japanese representative, Nagaoka, to agree to the resolution, but Nagaoka refused to agree to any method of transferring the negotiations from Shanghai to Geneva. However, he has telegraphed Tokyo for instructions. The special committee's resolution stipulates that the Shanghai Mixed Commission can determine when the situation allows for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. Japan's objection lies in this provision.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st - Dentsu News Agency: Regarding the request for instructions from Nagaoka, the chief delegate in Geneva, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa convened a meeting of the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon. As a result of the discussions, they believe that the contents of the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen do not properly explain the issue and are erroneous. They reached a consensus and sent a reply to Delegate Nagaoka last night stating that Articles 7, 8, 11, 12, and 13 of the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen, especially Articles 8 and 11, are completely erroneous and unacceptable to the Japanese government. They also believe that they hinder the progress of the Shanghai ceasefire talks and point out that they create a crisis that could lead to a breakdown. The Japanese government cannot fully agree to the resolution and will communicate this in an appropriate manner. They also conveyed the Japanese government's hope that the Committee of Nineteen will give the matter deep consideration.</p>
<h3>Ceasefire Conference Awaits</h3>
<p>Draft Resolution of League of Nations</p>
<p>Although We Formally Accept</p>
<p>Japan Still Strongly Opposes</p>
<p>Regarding the draft resolution passed by the Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified Guo Taiqi, the Shanghai representative of the Ministry, at 12:00 late the day before yesterday, stating that the National Government had formally instructed Delegate Yan of the League of Nations to accept the resolution. The full text of the draft was sent to Shanghai by airmail yesterday morning, but due to the time required for translation, it has not yet been published as of last night. It will be officially released today.</p>
<p>Early Stages of Shanghai Conference - A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated yesterday that the government has not yet received any instructions regarding when the ceasefire conference will continue, and it is still difficult to determine. It is inaccurate that Chief of Staff Huang and Secretary Guo have been secretly holding small group meetings at the British consulate in recent days. Secretary Guo's visit to the British counselor was to inform him that Japanese troops have repeatedly crossed the Suzhou River in an attempt to create panic on the south bank of the Suzhou River, and to ask representatives of friendly nations to pay attention. There was no talk of holding meetings. It has been decided to consult with the chief representatives of both sides before the small group meeting is held. Therefore, it is difficult to convene the small group meeting before the formal meeting is resumed.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Taiqi's Remarks - A reporter from the China Eastern News Agency visited Mr. Guo Taiqi yesterday. Guo said that the central government had instructed Delegate Yan to accept the League of Nations resolution. China has accepted the League of Nations resolution from beginning to end, and this is nothing new. The content of the draft resolution of the League of Nations states that the Japanese troops must withdraw completely once the situation permits, without the need to restore the normal state, etc. It must be understood that the so-called normal state is a political issue. How can the League of Nations contradict its resolution of March 4th? Although this resolution is not fully satisfactory, we reluctantly accept it out of respect for the League of Nations. However, the Japanese side suddenly strongly opposes it, so the future is still quite worrying. The reason for the Japanese opposition is difficult to know. Speculatively, it may be that the Japanese side believes that the draft resolution authorizes the great powers to organize a mixed committee to decide on the timing of the withdrawal of Japanese troops, which is suspected of interference by a third country and is contrary to its purpose, so they resolutely reject it.</p>
<p>American Envoy Did Not Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday - American envoy Johnson and his wife flew to Nanjing a few days ago for official business. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai yesterday morning. However, according to news from the airline yesterday afternoon, the American envoy did not take the plane back to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Guo Jianhua Recounts His Arrest and Escape</h3>
<p>The Abhorrence of Openly Aiding and Abetting Traitors</p>
<p>Detailed Inquiry into Our Military Situation Under Sweet Inducements</p>
<p>Escape Through the Window Resulting in Serious Injuries to the Waist and Lungs</p>
<p>Previously, this newspaper translated and published a report from the Shanghai Evening Post, stating that a member of the aviation team, Guo Jianhua, was arrested by the Japanese side near Yangshupu. According to a reliable investigation by reporters, Guo Jianhua is a misprint of Guo Jianhua, whose courtesy name is Weimin, who once worked in the General Headquarters and is now serving in a certain agency. He was arrested by the Japanese side on the 16th and escaped on the 19th. However, he suffered severe internal injuries and is being treated in a certain hospital. The reporter met Mr. Guo yesterday, and he recounted the details of his arrest and escape in great detail. According to him, "On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, at 4:00 PM, I was wearing ordinary Western-style clothes and went to Yangshupu for business. In front of the Japanese headquarters on Linping Road, I was arrested by Yao Zidu, the leader of the detective team of the pro-Japanese puppet maintenance association, and three other traitors in long robes, carrying pistols. They dragged me to the puppet agency opposite Yucai Elementary School without allowing me to explain. Hu Lifu, a traitor, personally interrogated me. He found a badge of the former headquarters and a diary in my Western-style clothes pocket, and immediately thought that I was there to inquire about military intelligence. He also confiscated more than 140 yuan from my pocket and immediately escorted me to the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters in the 63rd Garden, and then transferred me to the Japanese Military Police headquarters. It was already 9:00 PM. A platoon leader greeted me with a smiling face and said, 'You are a high-ranking military officer and should enjoy preferential treatment. After the battalion commander comes tomorrow and asks you a few questions, you will be released. There will be no problem.' That night, I stayed in a privileged room on the third floor. There was already an old man named He there, who said he was a doctor in Liuhe and was suspected by the plainclothes team and had been detained for more than 30 days. There were no fewer than 30 or 40 of our soldiers and civilians detained downstairs. A slight carelessness would lead to being shot. A young couple who were brought in a few days ago were also identified as plainclothes soldiers and are still in custody, etc.' The next day (i.e., the 17th) at 8:00 AM, the battalion commander came to interrogate me and diligently inquired about the deployment of our troops and all military information. I told him that the headquarters had long been abolished and that I was no longer working for the 19th Route Army or the 5th Army, so I knew absolutely nothing. He continued to entice me, but I was unmoved. He suddenly changed his face and ordered the Japanese soldiers to beat me with their rifle butts and ordered me to be returned to the cell. On the morning of the same day, a company commander came to persuade me to reveal information, but still to no avail. On the afternoon of the 18th, the Japanese soldiers ordered all the arrested people to gather in the courtyard. Each was hung with a flag of our party and country, and each soldier was ordered to wear our military uniform and take a group photo. Finally, I was ordered to take a single photo. I firmly refused and cried loudly towards the national flag. The battalion commander came again and said that this person was hopeless. I knew that my life was on the verge of despair, so I faced it calmly. On the morning of the 19th, I learned that I would be executed by shooting that night. Thinking that it was not worth dying in this way, I took the risk and jumped out of the window on the third floor at 9:00 AM. The height was about 20 feet, and I fainted and lost consciousness. After more than ten minutes, I woke up and crawled out, winding my way to the park shooting range. Fortunately, a rickshaw driver passed by and carried me away. I began to celebrate my rebirth. My waist and lungs were severely injured. After arriving at the hospital, I vomited a lot of blood. Today (the 21st), I am out of danger, etc."</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Land in Violation of the Agreement</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Will Lodge a Serious Protest</p>
<p>According to the China Eastern News Agency, at 10:40 AM the day before yesterday, Japanese aircraft No. 65 crashed in Pudong, killing and injuring one pilot each. At that time, the Japanese side notified our diplomatic authorities stationed in Shanghai that they intended to send armed soldiers to the crash site to transport the damaged aircraft. This was sternly rejected by the Ministry. After repeated negotiations by the Japanese side, the Ministry reached an agreement with the Shanghai Municipal Government that the Japanese side would send unarmed engineers to transport the parts. The Japanese side immediately agreed. However, afterwards, the Japanese side violated the agreement and sent a large number of naval and army personnel to land in Donggou, and they were heavily armed along the way. Although no incidents occurred, the nearby residents were frightened. The municipal government is paying close attention to this matter and will lodge a serious protest with the Japanese consul after receiving a formal report from the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Provoke at the Front</h3>
<p>Kunshan, 21st - Special Dispatch: According to reports, the enemy in Nanxiang and Huangdu has been moving towards Fengjiabang very busily in recent days, with the appearance of advancing south. On the night of the 20th, dozens of enemies from Xinmu Bridge in Taicang launched a surprise attack and were repelled by our defending soldiers. This was the first time the enemy had launched a night attack. This afternoon, three to four hundred enemies launched an attack in two directions on our Xinmu Bridge and Hengli Bridge positions. On the Xinmu Bridge side, several were killed by our side, and five guns were seized. There was no contact on the Hengli Bridge side, and they left immediately.

<h3>Feng Yuxiang Telegram to Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>Declining the Gift of Funds</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang telegram to Wang Jingwei: Urgent, Luoyang, Director Wang Jingwei, Jian. I respectfully acknowledge your telegram. I am recuperating in Mount Tai, and I am deeply grateful for your kind thoughts. One day of external loyalty to Japan is one day of suffering for the people. We must be particularly frugal in our expenditures. The country's financial difficulties have reached an extreme in recent years, and it is surviving by issuing public bonds and increasing taxes. There are many reasons for this, but the main reason is that half of it is due to the lack of construction for the people's livelihood, and half of it is due to the casual gifting of millions and hundreds of thousands of dollars to people. If this is the case, then those who receive the funds will think that the road to seeking funds is too easy and will spend them casually, leading to today's extravagant style. Those who gift the funds inevitably haggle over every penny when they receive them and try their best to squeeze the people, leading to today's unbearable politics. Every time I see the suffering of the people and the extravagance of the officials, I feel extremely heartbroken. You, sir, have come out to govern in the face of national crisis and resistance against Japan. Whether it will be effective in the future depends entirely on your efforts. However, every penny of this money is the blood and sweat of the people, and the trend of not allowing abuse must be strongly promoted and implemented to comfort all comrades. Xiang and you, sir, are good comrades who can talk about anything, so I dare to present this matter to you. I dare not accept the funds. I respectfully thank you and thank Brother Jieshi for his kindness. Feng Yuxiang, Shen.</p>

<h3>Jiefa Steamer Runs Aground and Has an Accident</h3>
<p>Japanese Shipowner Causes Disaster</p>
<p>Loss of Six or Seven Hundred Thousand</p>
<p>The Yingkou Zhiyuan Company's Jiefa Steamer, which transported goods from Shanghai to Longkou, ran aground on a reef in the Bohai Sea due to the Japanese shipowner's negligence. The ship was destroyed, and all the Chinese sailors and others on board were in danger. The details of this matter will be recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Crew Encounter Danger During Wartime - The ship has a deadweight of 4,000 tons and specializes in sailing to Japan, Korea, and various ports in the northern and southern oceans of Shanghai. The senior crew members on board, the shipowner, the first and second mate, and the first and second engineer are all Japanese, while the lower-level crew members and sailors are Chinese.</p>
<p>Careless Unloading in Qingdao - This time, it came from Dalian to Shanghai to load kerosene, sulfur, gasoline, and cars at the Deccan Grotto Wharf, and went to Qingdao and Longkou to unload. It first arrived in Qingdao on the 12th to unload some goods, and then went to Longkou. Unexpectedly, as soon as it arrived at the Qingdao wharf, a worker had a cigarette spark that was left in the sulfur, causing a sudden fire that was very intense. Fortunately, it was at the wharf, and they tried their best to put it out, so it could be extinguished. However, part of the ship was already damaged.</p>
<p>Runs Aground on Sangdao Reef - After departing from Qingdao, at 4:40 PM on the 13th, while sailing in the sea off Qimu Island in the Bohai Sea, the weather was clear and there were no winds or waves. The Japanese shipowner on duty ran the ship aground on the Sangdao reef stone between Changshan Island and Qimu Island due to negligent driving. The collision was extremely violent at the time, shaking the entire ship, and the bow cabin was stranded on the reef. The bottom iron plate of the wheel immediately ruptured, and sea water rushed into the ship.</p>
<p>Wind and Waves Break the Hull - After the accident, the shipowner telegraphed for help, but no ships came to help. It was delayed until the 14th, when a strong wind and waves suddenly rose on the sea, causing the ship to roll and crash against the reef. In a short time, the bottom of the ship was completely destroyed, and water entered the engine room, the boiler fire went out, and it was about to sink. All the Chinese crew members and sailors on board had to put on life jackets and prepare to fall into the sea and drift, leaving it to fate.</p>
<p>Ship, Rescued from Suffering - Dalian first sent a reply telegram, saying that a rescue ship would be coming soon. However, for two days, the 14th and 15th, they waited for a long time without arriving. It was delayed until the morning of the 16th before a small rescue ship, Round Island Maru, finally arrived. Fortunately, the wind and waves gradually subsided at this time. The sailors and sailors who fell into the water were fortunate not to be injured after two days and three nights of danger. When they were rescued on the small boat, they were all exhausted.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Cargo and Ship Losses - The gasoline, kerosene, sulfur, etc. in the Jiefa Steamer were completely lost after being watered. The ship's hull was also broken and bottomless. Because it was stranded on the reef, it has not yet sunk, but it is impossible to salvage it. In total, the loss of cargo and ships is at least 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. The crew and sailors' luggage and clothing were also completely lost. The incident was caused by the Japanese's negligent driving and erroneous course selection. After the accident, the Japanese crew members acted as if nothing had happened and did not try to rescue the people. The distressed Chinese crew members have reported to the company.</p>
<h3>Record of Inspection After the Opening of the Border Roads</h3>
<p>The Tram Numbers 5, 6, and 7 Can Now Reach Directly</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the concession authorities dispatched a large number of workers to remove all the iron nets and sandbags from the entire area along the border roads, as well as at locations such as Ai'erjin Road, the end of North Zhejiang Road, North Shanxi Road, Kenenghai Road, and the end of North Henan Road. All the iron gates on each road were also completely opened. The situation is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>At the end of North Henan Road and the end of North Zhejiang Road, the iron gates at the entrances and exits of Tram Number 6 were opened, and trams can now enter and drive. Trams Numbers 5, 6, and 7 come and go one after another, but there are very few passengers. However, the number of people visiting along the street is increasing. Outside the iron gate on the north side of the border road, an additional layer of iron netting has been added, and internal and external traffic is still cut off. On the road within the iron gate near the station, only Japanese military vehicles are galloping. The Chinese who walk back and forth on the street are also sparse and passable. Two or three Japanese soldiers in the station are patrolling with guns, looking very ferocious.</p>
<p>On the walls of the Shougang Station at the intersection of Baoshan Road and at the North Station, advertising boards are erected. Gun and cannon emplacements are as dense as a honeycomb. The iron gate at the exit and the iron gate at the end of North Zhejiang Road's Fengyu Lane were both blown off their main pillars by artillery shells, which is quite shocking. Inside the lane's doors, there are numerous gun and cannon holes. The gatehouse of Shengshun Lane and even the walls are all destroyed. The station buildings are completely empty, with only tall walls remaining. The warehouses in the west area are all destroyed, with broken tiles, collapsed walls, scorched wood, and rotten iron scattered horizontally and vertically. Destroyed goods are visible everywhere. Looking into the distance, there are still a dozen or so train cars in the tracks, but no military personnel are visible. Their glass windows and side panels seem to be mostly damaged.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the shops along the border road, including Shanghai Bank, Jiaotong Xuehang, China Rapid Transit Company, North Station Post Office, and various large and small shops, were all busy organizing their interiors and moving back equipment or goods, appearing to be preparing to reopen. Although some residents in the lanes had already moved back, there are still quite a few who have not moved back. Therefore, there are very few shoppers at the Ai'erjin Road small vegetable market every morning, indicating that most have not yet moved back. Furthermore, in areas west of North Zhejiang Road, such as Huaxingfang, the iron netting still exists, and it is feared that it will not be removed.</p>
<h3>Pond Construction Conference to Repair the Seawall</h3>
<p>Three Million Needed, to be Raised by the Central Government, Province, and City</p>
<p>Resolved to Divide into Four Groups to Nominate Members to Formulate Measures</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Pond Construction Committee held its second meeting at the Municipal Government a few days ago, chaired by Chen Guangfu. More than ten committee members attended, including Wu Yunzhai, Zhang Gongquan, and Jin Qibao. Shen, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, and the Directors of the Wan and Xu Seawall Offices attended as observers. It is estimated that repairing the seawall will require more than three million yuan. It is proposed that the provincial and municipal governments each raise one million yuan, and that the central government allocate one million yuan. The remaining amount will be raised from the people through donations. It was resolved to nominate three committee members each from the central government and the Disaster Relief Committee (Chen Guangfu, Zhang Gongquan, and Zhu Ziqiao), the provincial government (Director Dong, Hong Baoying, Wu Yunzhai, and Yuan Xiluo), the municipal government (Zhao Jinqing, Lin Kanghou, and Du Yuesheng), and the people's donations (Huang Renzhi, Wang Yiting, and Jin Qibao) to form groups to formulate measures and submit them for discussion at the next meeting. Committee member Shen Lisun was also nominated to liaise and coordinate with each group to carry out the work.</p>
<h3>President of the Local Court, Shen Xiqing, Swore in Yesterday</h3>
<p>The new President of the Shanghai Local Court, Shen Xiqing, held a supplementary swearing-in ceremony in the court's First Tribunal at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Guests: The swearing-in supervisor, Lin Zhezhang, representative of Jiangsu High Court President Lin; Jiang Huaizhen of the Municipal Party Department; Zhang Dabing, Chief Secretary of the High Court's Second Branch; Wang Zhennan, Chief Prosecutor; representative of the Third Branch, Zhou Xianjue, President of the First Special Court; Ying Shi, President of the Second Special Court; Chen Beisan, Chief Prosecutor; Wang Daying of the Ministry of Justice; Liu Maochu, Chief Prosecutor of this Court; Ding Shuhua of the Customs; Wen Yingxing, Director of the Public Security Bureau; Yan Shenyu, Shanghai County Magistrate; Dong Changmin, Director of the Second Prison; Xie Fuci, Deputy Prison Director; Shao Zhenji, Warden of the Detention Center; Lu Dingkui, representative of the Lawyers Association; Wang Haifan of the Accountants Association; and all the court's judges, prosecutors, clerks, and other staff members, gathered together. Wang Pengjun, the Chief Clerk, led the clerks in receiving the guests.</p>
<p>Order of the Swearing-in Ceremony: (1) The swearing-in supervisor takes the chair; (2) The person swearing takes their place; (3) Everyone stands at attention; (4) Sing the Party Anthem; (5) Pay the highest respects to the portrait of the late Premier and the Party and National Flag; (6) The chairman respectfully reads the late Premier's will; (7) Silence; (8) The person swearing takes the oath; (9) The swearing-in supervisor gives a speech; (10) The Party Department representative gives a speech; (11) Guests give speeches; (12) The person swearing gives a reply; (13) Ceremony concludes with a photograph.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Oath: I solemnly swear that I will恪遵 the late Premier's will, obey the Party's principles, abide by the laws, and strive in my duty. I resolve not to waste a single penny or misuse a single person, and I resolve not to engage in corruption, fraud, or the giving or receiving of bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment. This is my oath.</p>
<p>Speech by the Swearing-in Supervisor: Lin Zhezhang, representative of the President of the Jiangsu High Court, said: Judicial independence was revealed by the late Premier as one of the five powers of the Constitution. At this time of political tutelage, when we are seeking to abolish consular jurisdiction, the improvement of legal affairs is even more urgent. The Shanghai Local Court is located in a major commercial port, with a large number of lawsuits, which attracts attention both domestically and abroad, and its responsibilities are particularly important. President Shen has previously served as a local director and has already achieved excellent results. This time, he has been reappointed to lead the court, which is a deliberate choice by the ministry to select a person familiar with the job. However, judicial matters are numerous and complex, and reorganization and renewal cannot be fully explained in a few words. Now, I will select the most important points and briefly describe them. First, uphold integrity. Corruption is the greatest taboo for officials. In the revolutionary era, the first priority is to eliminate corruption. Judicial officials, in particular, should be honest and self-disciplined. Not only should bribes be strictly rejected, but even ordinary social interactions should be frugal. Cultivate a spirit of integrity. Second, uphold impartiality. In ancient times, the Minister of Justice was called the "balance of the world," which was a very good intention. Because the interests of the people's lives and property, once involved in litigation, are in the hands of the judge. Judges should adjudicate cases based solely on impartiality, like a scale, without bias, and with appropriate weight, so that the people will have no unjust grievances. Third, be prudent and diligent. Judicial officials should regard handling cases as their sole duty. If they are not careful, the cases will be flawed, causing harm to the people. If they are not diligent, the cases will be delayed, causing trouble to the people. Therefore, all habits of laziness and acts of negligence should be absolutely eliminated by judges. Fourth, eliminate malpractices. The clerks, police, and servants of judicial organs are most likely to engage in malpractices in matters such as summoning cases, appearing in court, investigating, and searching. The entry and exit of prisoners in detention centers and their treatment are also all possible sources of malpractice. It is hoped that as leaders, they will supervise strictly at all times, so that all malpractices can be completely eliminated to reduce the suffering of the people. Although the above points are common talk, they are the guide for judicial officials, and the emphasis is on their practical implementation. President Shen has excellent talent and knowledge and will surely uphold the late Premier's fearless spirit and strive for the welfare of the people. Today, on the occasion of the swearing-in ceremony, I have specially taken a few words to encourage him. This president has high hopes.</p>
<p>President's Reply: Chairman and distinguished guests, today, I, Xiqing, am holding the swearing-in ceremony as usual. I am very honored to have you all here. I am grateful for the instructions of the chairman and others. Everything that I could not do in Jiangsu, I can do within this scope. I will only strive to encourage myself and handle matters according to law in order to repay you all. I hope you will give me guidance at any time, etc.</p>
<h3>Various Groups are Rising to Discuss the National Emergency Savings Plan</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Federation, etc., believing that the implementation of the National Emergency Savings Plan will not be perfect without detailed discussion, specially invited various groups to meet at the Atlantic Restaurant on the 24th of this month to discuss the active implementation of the National Emergency Savings Plan.</p>
<p>The Fifth Ma Road Jiangxi Road Business Federation and the Eleventh, Twelfth, and Sixth Branches of the Citizens' Association also resolved through the Standing Committee to hold a joint members' meeting at the antique market on Fifth Ma Road, Jiangxi Road, at 6:00 p.m. on the 25th of this month to discuss the implementation of the National Emergency Savings Plan and issues such as reducing or exempting police patrol fees and rent.</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Fourth Road Business Federation, hearing that the Japanese army has a strategy of focusing on the left wing, where it is located, is particularly enthusiastic about the National Emergency Savings Plan. It is reported that the federation has already started working on the plan and will hold a meeting to discuss it soon.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Aivenyi Road Ninth Road Business Federation, taking the implementation of national salvation savings as a matter of utmost urgency, held its first preparatory meeting yesterday. It is reported that the following items were resolved: (1) Send a letter to each store on this road to quickly nominate one person as a representative of the national salvation savings account holders in order to convene a representative conference of savings account holders in the shortest possible time to formally establish a National Salvation Savings Committee; (2) The draft plan and regulations for national salvation savings will be drafted by Wu Ban and Chen Guangxiang; (3) After all the savings account holder representatives have reported, a representative conference will be convened immediately.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Merchants and Residents Decide to Waive Rent for February, March, and April</h3>
<p>Post Slogans and Submit to the Social Bureau for Record</p>
<p>Federation Urges Filling Out Damage Registration Forms</p>
<p>The Hongkou District branches of the Citizens' Federation, and the Yansupu, Suzhou Road, Haining Road, North Xizang Road, West Huade Road, Hanbili Road, Yixiang, Huahai, Broadway Road, Aierjin Road, Wuzhou Road, Jiaxing Road, and North Shanxi Road business federations and other groups jointly resolved that the environment in Hongkou is harsh, and the difficult situation is hard to describe in words. Therefore, even today, businesses are still closed. The rent waiver is initially set for February, March, and April, and will be discussed again later depending on the situation. The joint office is now making slogans for rent waivers and distributing them to all members to post in front of their doors, requesting landlords to provide relief, and submitting them to the Social Bureau for record. The text reads: "A petition for the approval of the waiver of rent to provide relief due to the economic depression and financial decline in the market. We are located in Hongkou, living under the artillery fire of the violent Japanese. Unlike the safe areas elsewhere, we dare not rashly open our businesses. The special pain we suffer is truly unbearable. In this harsh environment, the economic panic in the market has reached its peak. Therefore, rent is a heavy burden that is essential to life, food, clothing, and housing. If it is not reduced or exempted, there is no way to stabilize the market and calm people's hearts. In view of the difficult situation, the association has jointly resolved at a joint meeting to waive rent for three months in the Hongkou area north of the Suzhou River, limited to February, March, and April. The situation will be discussed again depending on how the situation develops in the future. Rent waiver slogans have been printed, and in addition to distributing them, we are submitting this document to your department for approval and record. This is for the public convenience." In addition, rent forms have been printed, asking members to fill them out for future reference. Since the establishment of the Hongkou Damage Committee, the office has been making every effort to investigate the facts of the damage. In addition to registration, it is also urging the damage registration forms issued by the various branches to be quickly filled out by each household for consolidation and reporting.</p>
<h3>Issue of Pawnshop License Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnshop Association and the Pawnshop Office recently petitioned the Public Works Bureau to restore the old system for estimating the collection of license fees. The old system was to collect fees based on the amount of business done in the previous quarter and the amount of interest charged. The new system has been in effect since April 1, 1930. The method is for each shop to pay a fixed amount, depending on the size of the shop. When the new method was implemented, the pawnshop industry protested, but the Public Works Bureau stated that if a shop had difficulties, the bureau would give full consideration to the situation. Therefore, the industry complied with the new system and paid the fees. Two years have passed, and there have been no obstacles. Now, the industry believes that the new law is quite inappropriate in this time of commercial depression and asks to restore the old law. After careful consideration, the Public Works Bureau believes that the new system is still satisfactory, and the fees set are generally fair. Moreover, the industry requires a particularly heavy amount of police management and protection. Therefore, it has been decided to continue to implement the new system. However, if it is necessary to revise the grade of a particular pawnshop, the bureau is very willing to consider it.</p>
<h3>New Charging Regulations for Electricity Company</h3>
<p>Taxpayers Association Asks Public Works Bureau to Order Cancellation Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association wrote to the Secretary of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, saying: "Dear Sir, it has been found that at the Taxpayers' Representative Assembly on the 11th of this month, regarding the proposal by Representative Zhou Fuzhang that 'the new regulations of the Shanghai Power Company require each household to pay at least three taels and seven mace and five candareens of electricity fees per month, which is unreasonable, please write to the Public Works Bureau to order the company to cancel it,' the resolution was unanimously passed. Correspondingly, the case is recorded and submitted to you, hoping that you will check it out and promptly order the company to cancel this unreasonable charging method.</p>
<h3>Famous British Textile Expert, Zu Huailu, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

Among them, the leaders Cao Guangda and Hu Zhonghou gave loud speeches along the streets when they were taken to the execution ground, saying that Japan was forcibly occupying the Northeast and that all compatriots should wake up.

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Gathering in Geneva Today</h3>
<p>Political Leaders from Various Countries Assemble</p>
<p>To Discuss Important World Issues</p>
<p>MacDonald Arrives in Geneva with Tardieu</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch from the National News Agency on the 20th: This Friday will see an unprecedented gathering of politicians from various countries, discussing the most complex issues since the Paris Peace Conference. All major powers, except Japan, are sending their prime ministers or foreign ministers. Many smaller countries are also sending their foreign ministers. The issues under consideration include Franco-German rapprochement, the Franco-Italian naval agreement, arms reduction, the economic and financial crisis in the Danube region, disputes in the Far East, and reparations and war debts—all major world events.</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch from Reuters on the 20th: The French elections are about to begin, but French Premier Tardieu has decided to travel to Geneva with British Prime Minister MacDonald today, which has surprised many. It shows that Tardieu is deeply aware of the importance of being in Geneva at the same time as the prime ministers of Britain, America, and Germany. The British and French prime ministers held a closed-door meeting for forty minutes. Although no official statement was issued, Tardieu said that they discussed various matters, especially focusing on Geneva. From this, it is clear that their discussions mostly concerned the issue of arms reduction. Tardieu did not express pessimism about arms reduction. British Prime Minister MacDonald arrived here by plane at 5:40 PM. After resting briefly at the British Embassy, he went to the French Foreign Ministry. In the evening, he boarded a train to Geneva with the French Premier. When the British Prime Minister left London, it was raining heavily, but he decided to travel by plane, saying that flying in the rain was the most pleasant form of travel. The British Prime Minister's eye ailment has not fully recovered, and his doctor is also traveling to Geneva tonight.</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch from Havas on the 21st: French Premier Tardieu and British Prime Minister MacDonald arrived here at 8:00 AM this morning. Tardieu is expected to stay in Geneva until Friday, after which he will return to Belfort to conduct his election campaign. He will return to Paris on Monday morning and then return to Geneva again on Tuesday morning, April 26th, to participate in the arms reduction conference work on Tuesday and Friday.</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch from the National News Agency on the 21st: British Prime Minister MacDonald today overturned the pre-arranged plan for a tripartite meeting by U.S. Secretary of State Stimson. Stimson suddenly stopped at French Premier Tardieu's residence at 8:00 AM tomorrow. After a brief conversation, he drove to the British Prime Minister's residence, picked up MacDonald, and returned to his residence for secret talks. Around 11:00 AM, Tardieu and U.S. Representative Davis went to Stimson's place, planning for a two-hour tripartite meeting. However, MacDonald strongly advocated going to the arms reduction conference and left first.</p>
<h3>Extreme Tension in the General Commission on Disarmament</h3>
<p>The Future of the Conference Does Not Permit Optimism</p>
<p>Paul-Boncour Vigorously Attacks Italian-American Plans</p>
<p>Most Countries Support Simon's Proposals</p>
<p>Sato Surprisingly Speaks for France</p>
<p>Liu Wendao Delivers a Thought-Provoking Speech</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch from the National News Agency on the 21st: Although the General Commission of the International Disarmament Conference continued its meeting today, the leaders of the four major powers did not attend initially. British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Premier Tardieu, and German Chancellor Brüning all had lengthy talks at Stimson's residence, hoping to find a compromise to overcome the current obstacles. The General Commission convened at 10:10 AM to continue discussing the Italian-American joint plan to conclude an international convention to abolish certain offensive weapons, and the resolution proposed yesterday by British Foreign Secretary Simon in support of the Italian-American plan. Canadian representative Penhale spoke first, enthusiastically supporting Simon's resolution. Norwegian representative Colban also strongly defended the Italian-American plan. The next to speak was French representative Paul-Boncour, who vehemently attacked the Italian-American plan and Simon's resolution, claiming that France could not accept the current form of the Italian-American plan because it would abolish the weapons that France intended to provide to the League of Nations forces. He also argued that organizing an international army, managed and used by the League of Nations with the weapons that Italy and America wanted to abolish, would be the greatest guarantee of world peace and security. The French believe that any arms reduction agreement should be based primarily on national security. French Premier Tardieu's hasty arrival in Geneva was because he saw that the Italian-American plan greatly threatened France's position. Therefore, Paul-Boncour's speech today was to defend this demand. Although his wording was tactful, his intention was firm and unwavering, indicating that France could not accept the abolition or restriction of any weapons until the General Commission accepted or rejected France's plan to arm the League of Nations with an international army. However, after France strongly rejected the British resolution, the conference fell into an extremely pessimistic state. The British Foreign Secretary's proposal was presented after much consultation and consideration, and its wording sought to avoid offending the French representative, so it guaranteed to abolish offensive weapons using only the most gentle methods, while not hindering other proposals. When the interpreters translated Paul-Boncour's lengthy speech, the listeners in the corridors whispered, fearing that the conference was not far from failure. Given the French attitude was so tough, it was expected that the conference would be forced to temporarily postpone voting on Simon's resolution and discuss the French plan, but many believed that the French proposal was doomed to failure. When Paul-Boncour was speaking, Simon looked very worried. When the interpreters were translating, the British Foreign Secretary immediately consulted with Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, looking quite anxious. U.S. Representative Gibson also joined in, and the three temporarily withdrew to another room to discuss how to proceed. At this time, German Chancellor Brüning arrived at the meeting and quietly took his seat. A few minutes later, British Prime Minister MacDonald also arrived and chatted with Litvinov, Sato, and the Persian representative Agha Khan. After the translation of Paul-Boncour's speech was completed, U.S. Representative Gibson took the stage to vigorously defend the Italian-American plan, especially insisting on the immediate abolition of artillery and tanks, declaring that although he was pleased that their goals had gained general approval, he still regretted that they had not agreed on the methods. He also replied to France's point that the Italian-American plan did not cover air and naval armaments, saying that they had already limited the navy, so this plan proposed reducing land armaments. Subsequently, he solemnly declared that the U.S. proposal did not hinder or prevent any country from negotiating any measures for the sake of security, and he affirmed that the U.S. supported Simon's resolution. Representatives from Ireland, South Africa, and Persia spoke in succession, all defending Simon's resolution. Representatives from Austria and Portugal followed, also expressing their support. Only Japanese representative Sato supported the French position, claiming that it was extremely difficult to determine whether a weapon was offensive or defensive, so there would inevitably be differences of opinion in selecting weapons to be banned. Chinese representative Liu Wendao followed with a thought-provoking and moving speech, advocating for Simon's resolution, declaring that the terrible destruction inflicted on his country's people by offensive weapons in recent months could serve as a lesson to the world, so he advocated abolishing all offensive weapons. After the Swedish representative spoke in support of Simon's position, the Italian representative delivered a passionate and eloquent speech, asking the entire assembly to vote unanimously in favor, declaring that Simon's resolution did not hinder the French plan.</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch from Reuters on the 21st: Today, the Marquess of Londonderry held a luncheon here, and among the guests were representatives from the five countries participating in the arms reduction conference: British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Premier Tardieu, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, German Chancellor Brüning, Italian Foreign Minister Grandi, and British Foreign Secretary Simon. The arms reduction conference has reached a critical juncture. Considering that Tardieu has suspended his important election campaign and Brüning has abandoned his domestic affairs to come here, one can imagine the seriousness of the situation. However, the world's major leaders have not yet been able to reach a resolution. Many parties now support Britain's arms reduction plan, which involves banning several of the most aggressive armaments. America, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and Canada have agreed to the suggestion put forward by Simon. Canadian representative Penhale declared today that this was the first concrete suggestion after three months of talks. Britain's suggestion and France's plan are contradictory, as France advocates that all large bomber aircraft, heavy artillery, large submarines, and warships over 10,000 tons should be placed under the command of the League of Nations. Representatives from the Irish Free State, South Africa, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Australia, China, Switzerland, and Soviet Russia also supported Britain's suggestion. Romanian representative Titulescu, while not opposing Britain's suggestion, has presented a resolution on substantive armaments plans on behalf of fourteen countries. The conference has been extended to April 22nd.</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch from the National News Agency on the 20th: In the General Commission of the International Disarmament Conference, British Foreign Secretary Simon proposed a resolution that supports Italy and America's abolition of offensive weapons and does not hinder the French plan to use offensive weapons exclusively for international armies. After suggesting that the principle of adopting the selection of certain types of weapons and banning their use by international convention be adopted, several small countries' representatives said that most of the proposals recently were not as thorough as Germany's proposal. The representative from Yugoslavia attacked the resolution put forward by Britain and proposed another resolution with a counter-proposal nature, requesting that ocean-going warships and submarines be abolished, that artillery and tanks be restricted, and that an agreement be made to make these weapons permanently available for use and direct control by the International League of Nations. Subsequently, Italian Foreign Minister Grandi and Lüford warmly supported the resolution proposed by Britain. As it was past noon, the meeting was adjourned and will continue tomorrow morning. At the beginning of this morning's meeting, Chairman Henderson put to a vote whether to continue the meeting this afternoon, but all the representatives were like primary school students, eager to get half a day off, and all opposed holding the meeting again in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch from Havas on the 20th: The first three months of the Disarmament Conference were a period of exploration. Now it has reached the center of the disarmament issue, or it can be said that the conference has fallen into the heart of the difficulty. However, this kind of difficulty is unavoidable for the conference. What is called the Commission is actually the General Assembly, because all national delegations have participated in it. In the past three days, the General Commission has discussed the most difficult issues, and how it resolves them is crucial to the success or failure of disarmament.</p>
<h3>400,000 Red Army Troops Stationed in Siberia</h3>
<p>Building 400 Bombers for Defense</p>
<p>| Russian Delegation Informs League of Nations Members |</p>
<p>Japanese Aggression Has Not Ceased</p>
<p>Tense Relations Between Russia and Japan</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch from the National News Agency on the 19th: Today, a spokesperson for the Soviet Russian delegation informed members of the League of Nations that Moscow's attitude towards Japan is extremely firm. There are now 400,000 troops stationed in Siberia, and 400 bombers have been built to protect the territory and defend against aggression. Also, U.S. Secretary of State Stimson today denied the rumor that he had met with Soviet Russian Chief Representative and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov.</p>
<p>Moscow Dispatch from Reuters on the 20th: Soviet Russian People's Committee Chairman Molotov said in a speech at the Trade Union Congress today that the facts have proved that the Japanese warlords and imperialists do have far-reaching aggressive intentions, not limited to seizing the three northeastern provinces. He also said that Soviet Russia's maintenance of peaceful relations with Japan is essential. The White Russians and the lackeys of the landlord capitalists and imperialist countries, as well as Chinese soldiers, who are willing to protect their interests at any cost, now all want to destroy Russian-Japanese relations. Molotov continued his speech, attacking the League of Nations and pointing out that the plans of the Far Eastern imperialists are related to the general staff of a certain Western capitalist country, saying that all things can show that the talk in the disarmament conference is only to cover up the true increase in armaments and the urgency of imperialist war. All of Russia's proposals have been rejected, so Russians have more necessity than before to work to maintain peace.</p>
<p>Riga Dispatch from Havas on the 20th: Judging from the editorials of Soviet Russian newspapers in recent days and the remarks of travelers arriving in Riga, it can be seen that Moscow is paying increasing attention to the possibility of a major dispute between itself and Japan. The most obvious thing is that Soviet Russian newspapers previously only attacked Japan's cunning, accusing White Russians of being used by Japan to engage in provocations and for all criminal acts. Soviet Russian newspapers, whenever they had the opportunity, were sure to tout Soviet Russian's peaceful ideas. The Soviet Russian press's attitude toward Japan was only like this before, but now they have changed their tune, saying that Soviet Russia will never allow its territory to be invaded, and when necessary, will resolutely resist aggressors. It is estimated that Soviet Russia foresees that in the future it will be forced by circumstances, or there will be a day when it cannot help but make concessions. The reason why it is currently adopting this attitude is precisely to take pre-emptive measures, so that even if it concedes in the future, it will not sacrifice too much. Currently, Moscow is eager for American assistance, so it is doing its best to exploit the conflict of interests between the United States and Japan in the Far East in order to obtain American cooperation. We can see this intention by browsing Soviet Russian newspapers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy and Air Force Hold Offensive and Defensive Exercises</h3>
<p>Two Aircraft Forced to Land in the Ocean</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from Japan United Press on the 21st: The Yokosuka Naval Base held a basic naval exercise at 5:00 AM on the 20th, assuming that the enemy's base was on Hachijojima. Under the imaginary premise that the enemy was attacking Japanese territory, defensive combat actions were practiced. The Oppama, Tateyama, and Kasumigaura air units all participated, performing aerial combat in the skies near Hachijojima. During this exercise, reconnaissance aircraft No. 108 and another aircraft had engine failures and landed in the ocean. One of them was severely damaged, but the crew members were not injured. Also, a carrier-based fighter plane from Kasumigaura went missing, and its whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>German Authorities Express No Intention of Recognizing the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Radio Station Communication is a Commercial Act</p>
<p>Berlin Dispatch from the National News Agency on the 20th: Today, German authorities made it clear that Germany has no intention of recognizing the Manchurian puppet state. Shenyang news claimed that the Shenyang radio station would soon be communicating with the German Nauen radio station, and this move could be interpreted as Germany de facto recognizing the new government of Manchuria. Therefore, German authorities denied this, saying that this interpretation was without basis. The communication between the two radio stations is purely a commercial act of the radio companies, no different from the agreed communication of the U.S. radio companies. It also solemnly declared that Germany will take the same attitude as the major powers on the recognition issue, with absolutely no intention of deviating from the crowd. Currently, none of the major powers have expressed a willingness to recognize the state.</p>
<h3>South African Leader Proposes Abolishing the Oath of Allegiance for Officials</h3>
<p>First Reading Passed by Parliament</p>
<p>Dublin Dispatch from the National News Agency on the 20th: The Irish Free State Parliament today allowed the new Irish head of state, Éamon de Valera, to present a bill to Parliament to abolish the oath of allegiance to the British monarch taken by Irish officials upon taking office. The bill immediately passed its first reading in Parliament today without a vote. Éamon de Valera has strongly opposed this oath of allegiance to the British monarch for decades during the revolution. Now, after taking office as head of state, he has begun to attack this oath ceremony. In the future, the British side will definitely criticize it, so the future is still unpredictable.</p>
<h3>Important News</h3>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan's Telegram to the Investigation Team Exposes Japanese Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of On-the-Ground Experiences Over Two Months</p>
<p>Hoping That the Investigation Team Will Make an Honest Report</p>
<p>After arriving in Heihe, Ma Zhanshan telegraphed the entire country, reporting that he would continue to resist Japan. At the same time, he also sent a telegram to the League of Nations Investigation Team. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Transmitted from Shanghai China Telegraph via Luoyang National Government, for the perusal of Director Zhang, Pacification Headquarters in Beiping. I am planning to send a telegram to the League of Nations Investigation Team, and I respectfully request that it be translated and forwarded. Since the Manchurian people have mixed with our Han people, for three hundred years, they have lived in Manchuria and lived in peace. Politics, culture, customs, language, and religion are all the same. Therefore, the political revolution of 1910, although it overthrew the Qing government and changed to a republic, there was not the slightest expression of hatred between the Han people and the Manchurian people. Moreover, the distinction in names between Manchurians and Han people also disappeared invisibly. This is generally seen and heard by people around the world who are slightly familiar with the situation in China, and it is certainly not my personal opinion. Therefore, the so-called Manchurians and Manchuria have become historical terms, and there is no value in citing them today. However, the Japanese must want to use them as a rare commodity, secretly using this old term in the dictionary to divide our nation and seize our land. It is unimaginable that in the 20th century, in the civilized world, there are still behaviors that despise international justice and are brutally inhumane, which is a fuse for destroying peace in East Asia. Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant has a provision that members of the League of Nations are responsible for respecting and maintaining the territorial integrity of all members of the League of Nations. Also, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 has provisions to guarantee China's territorial and administrative integrity and the open door and equal opportunity in the three northeastern provinces. These all made it difficult for Japan to annex the three northeastern provinces, so it used the name of national self-determination and, by means of kidnapping, forcibly robbed the abdicated Emperor Puyi, escorting him from Tianjin to Lushun. It also threatened and lured the original officials of the three northeastern provinces to stage a farce. Puyi tried to commit suicide with medicine many times on the way, but was discovered and stopped by the Japanese who were monitoring him. He could not die, and his situation was also miserable. I, Ma Zhanshan, was ordered by the National Government to serve as Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government and Deputy Commander of the Northeastern Border Defense Army stationed in Jiang. I am responsible for the defense of Heilongjiang Province. However, since the September 18th Incident last year, the Japanese army successively occupied Liaoning and Jilin provinces, and then deliberately plotted against Heilongjiang. Under the pretext of repairing the Nenjiang Bridge, it attacked our army by surprise. I, Ma Zhanshan, immediately took the front line and tried to defend myself. We exchanged fire for a period of two weeks. Due to the poor quality of weapons and the exhaustion of ammunition, we retreated to Hailun. However, the headquarters of the Japanese army repeatedly sent people to say that the military and political authorities of Liaoning and Jilin provinces had now agreed on a method for organizing new administrations in the two provinces. When the new administrations were established, Japan would withdraw its troops immediately and would never interfere in administration. Only Heilongjiang Province is an obstacle, causing the entire situation to be restless. In order to restore the security of the three provinces, I would return to Heilongjiang and unconditionally return the Heilongjiang government. After arriving in the province, the Japanese army would immediately withdraw, etc. At the same time, the puppet heads of Liaoning and Jilin provinces, under the instruction of the Japanese, sent people to say that the new administration was indeed independent in nature. Therefore, I agreed to return to the province in order to observe the situation and make a decision. Unexpectedly, after entering the province, the Japanese, as a dignified country, disregarded good faith and immediately broke their promise. Not only did they not withdraw a single soldier, but they also used the pretext of the unity of the three provinces to establish a puppet state, so as to implement the steps for annexation. Therefore, the positions of administrative committee member, Heilongjiang provincial governor, and army chief of staff were fabricated one after another. I, Ma Zhanshan, was able to take this opportunity to observe the inner workings of the Japanese aggressors and the truth of the puppet state, so as to contribute it to your association, which is the only organization for maintaining world peace and advocating international justice. This is also a great fortune in misfortune. I will now disclose the summary of my diary of my actual experience over the past month to your investigation team for reference. Please review it. On February 16th, I reluctantly complied with the Japanese request and went to Liaoning by plane to attend a meeting. On February 17th, I met with Honjo Shigeru, who claimed that the Japanese army had occupied most of the three northeastern provinces, and only a small part of Heilongjiang and Jilin was extremely difficult to resist. He requested that I cooperate with the Japanese. That evening, a meeting was held at Zhao Xinbo's residence. All the plans I proposed to abolish the establishment of the puppet state were sternly rejected by Itagaki of the Japanese side. The meeting ended without results that day. On February 18th, I pretended to be sick and returned to Hailun by car. According to Zhao Zhongren's report, on the 19th, the Japanese army headquarters ordered Zhang Jinghui and Zhao Zhongren to lead twelve puppet representatives from the three provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang who had been bribed by the Japanese to go to Dalian to entreat Puyi to be the puppet head, and instructed Puyi to decline three times. The representatives pleaded three times before finally accepting the order. On March 8th, the Japanese repeatedly invited me to Changchun. I was planning to find an excuse to shirk, but I was afraid that it would cause suspicion, so I had no choice but to go to Changchun to welcome Puyi. On the 9th, Puyi assumed the position of puppet head. All the ceremonies were presided over by the Japanese. A puppet appeared on the stage, and this is what it means. The most hateful thing is that Honjo Shigeru came to Changchun to monitor Puyi's inauguration and ordered Puyi to respectfully greet him at the east station. After repeated requests, some face was saved, and it was agreed that the puppet Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu would represent him. This shows that Honjo really regarded himself as the governor-general, and what he called coexistence and co-prosperity was completely a deceptive trick. On March 10th, the Japanese side, through Komai and Itagaki, held a puppet state council meeting with orders from the Japanese military department. At the same time, it also announced that the Manchurian puppet government would set up a chief of general affairs, who would be filled by a Japanese and would be in charge of all real powers in the various departments. All government orders could not be executed without the signature and seal of the puppet chief of general affairs. On March 11th, Colonel Staff Officer Itagaki and Puppet Chief of General Affairs Komai declared at the puppet state council meeting that the Japanese government originally intended to participate in half of the officials in the new government and the puppet provincial governments, but now they are trying their best to reduce it, and only added one hundred and several dozen Japanese to the new government in Changchun. It was also said that Japanese people residing in the three northeastern provinces would belong to the nationality of the new country, and all public rights would be enjoyed equally with the Manchurians. As for whether they would renounce Japanese nationality, they would have the right to weigh it, and others would not be allowed to interfere. It was also decided that the chiefs of general affairs and police affairs departments to be filled by Japanese in Liaoning and Jilin provinces would be assigned to be in charge of all real powers in the respective provinces. All government orders could not be implemented without their signature and seal. It was also agreed that the assignment of Heilongjiang province would be postponed for three months. On March 16th, Honjo Shigeru came to Qiqihar and inspected the Daxing area. During the conversation on the way, (1) the entire Japanese nation had made up its mind and would rather pay any sacrifice than give up the three northeastern provinces. (2) Anyone who opposed the new government would be the sole responsibility of the Japanese army to eliminate completely. (3) If any third country came out to interfere, it had made the final determination to declare war. (4) Regarding all government orders, they could be carried out step by step, but they had to be approved by the local Japanese military department and special service agencies before they could be implemented. Also, the puppet State Council decided that (1) all land in the northeast that had been released, if the location was for officials or warlords, would be confiscated in full. If the number of mu of civilians was large, half of them would be purchased at the official price and all would be taken back by the puppet state for use by the Japanese government for immigration purposes. (2) The Hulan-Hai Railway is the hub of Heilongjiang Province's grain transportation. The Japanese and Zhang Jinghui signed a contract, forcibly mortgaging it for 3 million yuan at a tenth of its price, with a term of 50 years, which is no different from permanent occupation. I fear that Ma Zhanshan will not recognize it.</p>
<h3>News Summary</h3>
<p>Signing of Supplementary Commercial Treaty: Despite strong refusals, the puppet state's Ministry of Transportation is being forced to proceed. (3) Planning to establish the puppet state's "Manzhou Bank" using the model of the Bank of Korea, with the aim of manipulating finances and extracting wealth from us. (4) Destroying our country's schools and invading our culture. In all schools, in addition to stationing troops, all of our original, nationally-approved textbooks at all levels that inspire patriotism are being revised and supplemented with pro-Japanese ideas, in order to eliminate our nation. Furthermore, Doihara, head of the Harbin Special Service Agency, and Suzuki, commander of the brigade, have stated that since Japan has obtained the three eastern provinces, once military expenses are sufficient, they will use them as a source for war strategies, first invading Soviet Russia to the north, then resisting the United States to the east, and gradually targeting other countries. The above are the experiences and circumstances personally witnessed by Ma Zhanshan. Currently, each county in the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin has two Japanese assigned to handle special affairs. Nothing can be implemented without their permission. All newspapers, telegrams, and telephones in the three eastern provinces are controlled behind the scenes by the Japanese, and newspapers have no true public opinion except to comply with Japanese intentions. Now that the esteemed investigation team is about to arrive in the east, the Japanese are warning intellectuals that anyone with speech unfavorable to Japan will be dealt with decisively. Anyone who opposes Japan is being secretly arrested and killed in their homes by the Japanese at night, and their families are warned that if they leak the news, they will face the same fate. Yan Tingrui, Zhang Kui'en, and others have all been killed. The so-called public opinion celebrating the establishment of the puppet state in the three eastern provinces is all fabricated by the Japanese. They are now also buying off unscrupulous and treacherous people to promote their virtuous rule. The above is what Ma Zhanshan has learned from his investigation. Now that the esteemed investigation team has arrived in our country, Ma Zhanshan, for the sake of national salvation, has resolutely risked the greatest danger and devised a plan to escape from Qiqihar, which is under strict surveillance by the Japanese army, and secretly come to Heihe, to carry out the duties of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government. All political affairs are carried out in accordance with the central government, and the truth of the organization of the puppet state of Manchukuo is presented to the esteemed investigation team, which has been specially commissioned to come to China, and to people all over the world who want to know the truth. Now, with the utmost sincerity, I swear and declare: Not a single person in our three eastern provinces is willing to separate from our country and live outside of it. Even the officials now working in the puppet government are under severe surveillance by the Japanese army and have lost their freedom. Please pay special attention to this and conduct an actual investigation so that an honest report can be made. Only then can the future of world peace be guaranteed, and the esteemed investigation team's contribution to world humanity will be eternally immortalized. Furthermore, Ma Zhanshan has more to say: Last autumn, hundreds of our overseas Chinese were killed in Korea, and property losses amounted to millions. But did our national government ever use the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to send a single soldier or general into Korea? In recent years, Japanese residents in our country have not faced any danger, but their government has brazenly sent troops to invade our eastern provinces and attack Shanghai, using the pretext of protecting the lives and property of its residents. Comparing the two, the upholders of justice in the world will have their own opinions. Moreover, Japanese residents are spread throughout the countries of the five continents. If their government sometimes also uses the pretext of protecting the interests of its residents to send troops and generals to invade the places where its residents live, then we are truly in danger of world peace. I hope the esteemed investigation team will consider this carefully. In addition to sending a direct telegram to our country's representative Yan in Geneva, this notice is hereby issued. Sincerely, Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, from Heihe.</p>
<h3>A Pessimistic View on Manchu-Mongolian Immigration by the Japanese Newspaper</h3>
<p>The Kobe Shimbun published an editorial on the 12th stating that the Ministry of Colonial Affairs' planned Manchu-Mongolian immigration project aims to relocate 100,000 households, or 500,000 people, within ten years. This year, it plans to relocate 640 households, about 3,000 people, with a budget of 3 million yuan, which was submitted to the extraordinary session of the parliament in May. However, the Ministry of Finance, citing a lack of funds, has refused to approve it and has expressed pessimism about the possibility of success of the Manchu-Mongolian immigration. The question of whether relocating the excess population to the vast Manchu-Mongolian region will be beneficial in terms of labor competition remains doubtful. If the government is already facing difficulties in spending 3 million yuan, then the planned immigration of 500,000 people over ten years may not be realized annually. It should be noted that Chinese laborers in Manchuria can live on coarse clothing and simple food with low wages. It would be impossible for our people (Japanese) to live this way. In addition, the harsh climate and unsuitable land in Manchu-Mongolia pose significant problems for immigration. Therefore, implementing a large-scale immigration plan without careful consideration is ignorant and clueless. Furthermore, after the Russo-Japanese War, our country's immigration associations flourished, and immigration was encouraged by all parties, but the results were disastrous. Therefore, the future of immigration today, so-called immigrants, are really nothing but abandoned people.</p>
<h3>Russians Destroy Documents Related to the Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>According to the Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun, the Chinese government had already established a policy demanding the return of the 8 million rubles of revenue from the Chinese Eastern Railway, as well as freight cars, passenger cars, locomotives, etc., which were in the custody of the Russo-Asiatic Bank. However, the Russian side has burned all documents proving the ownership of freight cars, passenger cars, locomotives, etc. As a result, the second Sino-Russian conference has no documents to verify and a major dispute is expected.</p>
<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Reconnoiter the Coast: A dispatch from Fengxian reports that an enemy plane suddenly appeared yesterday morning (19th), passing over Nanqiao and heading southwest. However, in less than half an hour, it returned along the same route. Unexpectedly, this morning (20th) at about 7:00 AM, multiple enemy planes came again, circling and reconnoitering around the seawall. The lowest ones were close enough to see their numbers and flags. They lingered back and forth for about four hours.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Spying on Pinghu: Pinghu County has recently been frequently overflown by enemy planes. They have also opened fire and shot at people in Jiangjiabang. At 10:00 AM on the 19th, a silver-gray plane came again, circling the city several times, spying on our defensive work. It flew high and low, circling all day. At its lowest, it was only about 200-300 meters above ground.</p>
<p>Banditry Rampant North of the River: Banditry has always been a problem north of the river, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Yesterday, a large number of bandits suddenly appeared in the Qiyemiao area east of Shaobo, armed with guns and displaying great force. They surrounded and attacked the defense corps. The corps members were too few in number to resist. It is estimated that more than ten rifles were seized, and more than thirty households in the town were robbed, with losses of about 20,000 yuan. By the time troops from various places arrived to pursue them, the bandits had already scattered into Shaobo Lake.</p>
<p>Police and Militia Seize Bandit Boat: Bandit activity is rampant in the border area between Tongzhou and Rugao counties. After suppression by the military and police, the bandits have scattered. On the 19th, the Baibu police and militia seized a bandit boat near the Jin Guanyin Temple, confiscating thirteen rifles and arresting two bandits, Jiang Xueshi and Jin Huiquan, who were handed over to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Anrit De Goes to the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Investigating American Business Losses</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that Mr. Anrit De, the American Commercial Counselor in Shanghai, took a boat to Dalian yesterday morning (20th) and will go to Shenyang and other places in Manchuria to investigate in detail the impact on American businesses. According to a responsible American official who spoke to our reporter yesterday, American interests in Manchuria have been virtually eliminated due to the actions of the Japanese. When asked if there was any hope of recovery, he said that if under the Chinese government, American businesses could expect to recover quickly and even prosper more than before. Otherwise, they may encounter the same fate as major American businesses in Japan in recent years, such as General Motors and American Trading Company, whose operations in Japan have been restricted by intentionally promulgated regulations and oppressed by high taxes, making it almost impossible to maintain. Now that the Japanese have gained a foothold in Manchuria, they may use the same methods on American businesses. Currently, American businesses in Manchuria are still at a standstill, and their losses are truly unspeakable. It is also heard that Anrit De will be away from Shanghai for about three weeks, and his duties will be temporarily assumed by Ms. Smith, the commercial attache. After he completes his task and returns to Shanghai, he will prepare a report and submit it to the American Ministry of Commerce. As for the rumor that Mr. An's trip to the north is intended to close the Shenyang office of the American Ministry of Commerce, it is not confirmed and has been officially denied by the American Commercial Counselor's Office in this city.</p>
<h3>Academic Circles in Shanghai Oppose the Increase in Postage for Books</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications announced the method of increasing postage, postal workers and students in Peiping have telegraphed their opposition, which has been repeatedly reported in various newspapers. Academic circles in Shanghai, including Liu Zhan'en, Ou Yuanhuai, Wu Jingtai, Cao Huiqun, Hu Dunfu, Chen Heqin, Huang Yanpei, Li Zhaohuan, Jiang Hengyuan, Wang Jin, etc., also believe that the method of increasing postage for books is enough to hinder the progress of our country's culture, and have specially telegraphed the Executive Yuan to express their opposition. The original telegram and original presentation are now found below.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Executive Yuan of the National Government: Shanghai newspapers report that the postage increase method for books, etc., proposed by the Ministry of Communications is extremely harsh and detailed, and it also regards provinces such as Gansu, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou as outside the pale of civilization, with particularly heavy increases. This is detrimental to the construction of promoting cultural development and the frontiers. Recently, the government has spent huge sums to promote aviation in the northwest, so why should postage for books in the border provinces be particularly increased? It is truly incomprehensible. It is requested that the Ministry of Communications be ordered to abolish the said method and maintain the old plan. We cannot bear to hope. In addition to a separate presentation, we first telegraph to inform you.</p>
<p>Presentation: The presentation is for the heavy increase in postage for books, and we earnestly request that the old plan be maintained in order to lighten the burden and provide funds for promotion. We have secretly read the Shen Bao published on April 17 of this year, the method of increasing postage, where postage for letters, postcards, books, printed matter, etc., has all been increased. Among them, the regulations for increasing postage for books and printed matter are extremely harsh and detailed, and for the five provinces of Gansu, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, they have been increased by two to three times. Zhan, etc., believe that the matter is of great importance to the future of our country's education and culture, and they dare not fail to contribute their humble opinions for consideration. According to the postage list of the Republic of China in 1925 and the fee increase notice in 1931, all books and printed matter were sent as ordinary mail. Except for Mongolia and Xinjiang, there were no differences in the postage charged between provinces. This time, the method of sending parcels in the past is applied to books, and the adjacent provinces and non-adjacent provinces, the places where rails are connected and the places where they are not connected, are all stipulated separately. As a result, postage has invariably increased. At a time when our country's cultural and educational undertakings need to be promoted vigorously, this method of increasing postage is enough to increase the burden of reading for the people of the whole country, and it will have a great impact on the promotion of the cultural and educational undertakings of the whole country. This is because we have to ask to maintain the old plan when observing on the general cultural and educational undertakings of the whole country. In addition, according to the previous postal regulations, except for Mongolia and Xinjiang, the postal charges for other provinces were the same throughout the country, with no differences. The explanation of this increase method is that in addition to Mongolia and Xinjiang remaining the same, Gansu, (Qinghai, Ningxia,) Shaanxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, etc., are also listed as exceptions, and the postage for sending books and printed matter in these five provinces has been increased by two to three times. The development of the west is an important plan for the construction of our country, and the closed customs and difficult livelihoods of the western provinces are also a fact that everyone can see. Then, promoting the education of the people of these provinces and reducing the burden of the people of these provinces is even more important. Recently, the government has spent huge sums to promote aviation in the northwest, so why should postage for books in the border provinces be particularly increased? It seems to be inconsistent with the government's policy of developing the interior. This is also because we have to ask to maintain the old plan when observing on the active construction of the western provinces. Zhan En, etc., believe that promoting the progress of the cultural and educational undertakings of the whole country, and developing the frontiers with closed customs and difficult livelihoods, are all urgent tasks for our country at present. Now, in the period of political tutelage, the responsibilities of the government lie in actively promoting them. If the method of increasing postage is actually implemented, the government's annual income can be increased, but the important undertakings of promoting national culture and education, and developing the frontiers, will inevitably be greatly affected. Zhan En, etc., are in danger and cannot remain silent. It is reasonable to prepare a document and request your approval and implementation, which is really for the public good. Respectfully submitted to Wang, the President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Two Organizations Request Postponement of Postage Increase</h3>
<p>The 20th District Branch of the Citizens' Federation and the Fourth Road Business Federation, because the postage increase is about to be implemented, yesterday specially wrote to the Ministry of Communications of the National Government, requesting a postponement of the implementation, and also wrote to the General Federation of Business Circles in all districts of the Citizens' Federation, requesting a unified position.</p>
<h3>North and East District Tax Reduction Plan</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession is currently considering a plan to reduce or exempt police tax in the North and East Districts. It is reported that the plan is to reduce or exempt residents in the North District for one to two months, and residents in the East District for four to six weeks. Residents living outside the Concession defense line who pay police tax will be granted a separate reduction or exemption based on their location and the actual extent of the damage they have suffered.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Writes to the Municipal Council to Request Lenient Enforcement Against Street Vendors</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession wrote to the Municipal Council yesterday, saying, "Regarding the matter of cracking down on street vendors, this association believes that it should be lenient. According to the letters from the street vendors, thousands of street vendors depend on selling goods on the roads for a living. They know to restrain themselves in terms of traffic order and have never caused any hindrance. However, the police often drive them away, arrest them, and impose fines. The suffering of the street vendors is extremely deep and great. Last year, fortunately, Director Yu Zhiqing took pity on the livelihoods of the common people and strongly persuaded the Municipal Council to make a comeback, benefiting the poor and creating happiness for society, which was a great merit. Now that the Shanghai war has temporarily subsided, the livelihoods of the people are in a very difficult situation. If the Concession authorities are really concerned about the fundamental security of the area, they should find ways to maintain the livelihoods of the poor, but instead, they are once again strictly cracking down on them. This is no different from forcing the common people to embark on a dangerous path. If the street vendors have no way to make a living and mistakenly take a step down the wrong path, it will inevitably have a great impact on the security of the Concession. Therefore, we have no choice but to request that your association consider the difficulty of the street vendors' lives and strongly request the Concession authorities to be lenient, directly saving the lives of thousands of people, which will also maintain the security of the Concession. We are extremely grateful and humbly request your understanding." In response, we request that your council consider the matter carefully, not simply focusing on formalities and creating more hidden dangers.</p>
<h3>Unemployment Relief Fund Management Committee Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Guo Shun, Wang Yansong, and Zhu Wenqi Elected as Executive Directors</p>
<p>Designation of China and Five Other Banks to Collect Donations on Behalf</p>
<p>The Shanghai War Zone Unemployment Relief Association, organized by the Social Affairs Bureau and others, has begun to raise funds after the establishment of the Fundraising Committee. The Management Committee has also appointed Xu Shiying, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Shi Liangcai, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Guo Shun, Ye Huijun, Xu Jiqin, Pei Yunqing, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Min Ruisheng, Fu Xiaoan, Zhu Wenqi, etc., as members. Yesterday at noon, Mai Chaochu of the Social Affairs Bureau, together with Zhu Wenqi, director of the Economic Division of the Association, invited all the Management Committee members at the Wewei Dining Hall on the 9th floor of the YMCA. More than ten people, including Xu Shiying, Guo Shun, Wen Lanting, and Pei Yunqing, formally announced the establishment on the spot. Secretary Zhang Zhenyuan attended and reported. Guo Shun, Wang Yansong, and Zhu Wenqi were elected as executive directors on the spot, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Designating five banks, including the Bank of China, Central Bank, Bank of Shanghai, Silk Industry Bank, and Zhonghui Bank, as collection points for donations, which will be coordinated by Committee Member Zhu Wenqi. (2) Appointing two national accountants, Xi Yushu and Wang Sifang, to audit the receipts and expenditures of donations to ensure transparency. The 5th Executive Committee meeting was held at 2:00 PM on the same day. After the reports were given by each division, the discussion focused on the implementation of temporary relief matters. It was resolved to reserve the decision and wait until a sufficient amount of funds has been raised before discussing methods.</p>
<h3>Poor Education Fund Continues to Recruit New Students</h3>
<p>The Poor Education Fund, founded by Mr. Wu Yunxu of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, recruited students last year whose academic performance was excellent. They were sent to universities such as Central, Zhejiang, and Datong for studies, and their performance was very good. Although the situation is unstable this year, the association is still proceeding as usual. A committee spring meeting was held at the Merit Forest a few days ago, attended by more than ten people including Cai Jiemin, Shen Xinqing, Cao Liangxia, Wu Yunxu, and Liao Maoru. It was decided that twelve new subsidized students would be recruited this year, and the funding would be donated by Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, Tianyuan Electrochemical Factory, and Chichang New Company. In addition to Cao Liangxia continuing as the chairman of the committee, Dr. Liao Maoru was newly appointed as the director-general.</p>
<h3>Local Maintenance Association Seeks Opportunities for Displaced Compatriots</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association, believing that the displaced compatriots were sitting idle all day long, specially organized a vocational guidance division to guide and introduce jobs for the displaced compatriots. Since its establishment, it has been conducting vocational surveys of the displaced compatriots and has introduced and helped more than a hundred people so far. It is heard that there are many displaced compatriots with specialized skills, such as carpenters, coppersmiths, blacksmiths, plasterers, and skilled male and female workers in yarn factories, silk factories, and knitting factories, and there are also those who are willing to work as waiters, male and female domestic workers, and interns in companies and factories. There are also those who are proficient in Chinese and English. If factories, shops, agencies, organizations, or consulates need the above-mentioned talent, they can write or visit the division at No. 66 Sichuan Road, 2nd Floor. This can not only facilitate the employment of people but also save the displaced compatriots from fire and water. It is a win-win situation. Enthusiastic people are encouraged to support it.</p>
<h3>Second Special District Court Burned a Large Batch of Drugs Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court, since its establishment in August last year, has set a rule to burn all confiscated contraband such as opium, lamps, guns, red and white pills, etc., once every three months. The first session was burned on November 14 last year. Yesterday was the date of the second session of drug destruction, which consisted of opium and drugs confiscated during the five months from November last year to March this year, and gambling paraphernalia confiscated during the six months from August last year to January this year, such as pai gow tiles, dice, lottery tickets, etc. In advance, the president of the court, Ying Shi, and the chief prosecutor, Chen Beisan, submitted a report to the Ministry of Justice and the Higher Third Branch Court and invited representatives from various agencies to supervise the event. Yesterday at noon, the president of the court first sent personnel to set up a venue in the open space in front of the staff dormitory of the Second Special District Prison next door to the court. A shed was built, and tables and chairs were placed. Meanwhile, Feng Meixue, the director of the confiscated goods warehouse, sent people to arrange all the drugs and gambling paraphernalia piece by piece on both sides of the venue, and prepared firewood, kerosene, salt, and other ignition materials. Yang Zhaoqi, the section chief of the Ministry of Justice, and Li Yuanxi, a clerk, came to Shanghai to supervise the event. Tang Zaili, the secretary of the Higher Third Branch Court, and Lin Xi, the chief secretary of the Higher Third Branch Prosecutor's Office, supervised the event.

At 3:00 PM, the secretaries and constables executing the event on the spot moved the drugs piece by piece to the front of the seats. After each representative inspected and verified the seals, they immediately threw the drugs into the fire in the firewood pile on the spot, poured kerosene on them, and added salt. The burning lasted for two hours before it was completed. A total of 272 guns, several hundred pounds of opium and red and white pills, and countless smoking lamps, smoking trays, smoking rods, lottery tickets, dominoes, etc., were burned. At 5:30 PM, the representatives took their leave and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Three Hemp Bags of Opium Intercepted</h3>
<p>Weighing a Total of 273 Jin</p>
<p>Western Constable No. 121 and Chinese Constable No. 556 of the French Concession patrolled Huangpu Beach in front of the Taikoo Wharf on the night of the 20th and saw three Chinese walking out of Xin Yong'an Street towards the wharf. A No. 12204 car from the Nanyang Motor Company drove from Gongguan Road and stopped at the wharf. A Chinese jumped out and ordered the previous Chinese to shoulder three hemp bags containing goods outside the wharf, seemingly wanting to load them onto the car. They were acting suspiciously. When the constables went forward to inspect them, the car immediately drove off and fled, and the three who carried the bags also abandoned the bags and ran away. The constables went forward to inspect the bags and found that they were all opium. They immediately took them to the police station, where they were weighed and found to be 273 jin. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Lawyer Gu Shoux of the police station stated that the opium in the three ownerless hemp bags was discovered by the patrolmen on Huangpu Beach and requested that it be confiscated first, and that the person who smuggled it be prosecuted after he has been identified. Western Constable No. 121 and Chinese Constable No. 556 reported the circumstances of the discovery. Judge Li Changnian ordered the opium to be confiscated and sent to the confiscated goods warehouse, pending investigation of the smuggler.</p>
<h3>Fire Log</h3>
<p>Wuzhou Road: A pavilion room at No. 8 Baocheng Lane, Wuzhou Road, Hongkou, suddenly caught fire at around 1:00 PM yesterday. Furniture, bedding, and other items, as well as one room, were burned. The fire was extinguished after the fire brigade drove to the scene.</p>
<p>Maigen Road: The Xiangshengtai Tea House at Nos. 31-32 Maigen Road, Public Concession, suddenly caught fire at 2:10 PM yesterday. The flames soared, and three houses were burned on the spot.

<p>Dongyouheng Road: The roof of the Zhongxing Cotton and Wool Weaving Factory at the corner of Dongyouheng Road and Gongping Road was filled with raw materials such as cotton and wool. Unexpectedly, at 3:50 PM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the storage room on the roof, and a large amount of raw materials was burned, estimated at about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Fortunately, the fire brigade came to the rescue and was able to save the houses. It was also a great fortune in the midst of misfortune. It is heard that the factory has fire insurance of 100,000 yuan and had a fire once last year.</p>
<p>Yongsheng Wharf: Gu Yiting, who lives at No. 9 Yongsheng Wharf, Nanshi, works as an employee in the China Business Company in Beishi. Since the war broke out in Shanghai, Gu took his family and moved all the valuable items in his home to the Concession, and rented the house to his friend Zhang Yingsheng. Zhang is a clothing broker, so he only stored clothing in the house. Yesterday at about 8:00 AM, the house suddenly caught fire for some unknown reason, and the flames soared, bursting through the roof. The fire brigades of each district were notified and drove to the scene to extinguish the fire. In addition to burning down the building where Zhang lived, the fire also affected the building of the Hemei Egg Shop at No. 10 next door. The police arrived and took the arsonist Zhang Wumin into the pre-trial detention center in the first district where he was in charge. Zhang Wu said that Yingsheng is my son, and we rented the house from Gu Yiting, but we have not yet signed a contract. Gu had fire insurance for more than 2,000 taels. The cause of the fire is unknown. He was ordered to be interrogated by the Relief Bureau.</p>

<h3>Striving for Tap Water Leads to the Death of a Woman</h3>
<p>Court Conducts Preliminary Examination</p>
<p>Police Still Need to Investigate</p>
<p>Guo, 42 years old, wife of Shao Mingde, a Henan native who buys and sells used goods at No. 25 Xixiang Lane, Lafayette Road in the French Concession, went to the public tap inside the alley to draw water at 5:15 PM on the 20th. She argued with Li Zhang, a young woman from Jiangbei living at No. 30 of the same lane, over who would draw water first. Li Zhang grabbed Guo's hair and beat her, with accomplices assisting, causing Guo to be injured and fall to the ground, dying instantly. The assailants scattered and fled. Shao Mingde, the deceased's husband, upon learning of this, reported it to the police. Detective Mao Jingen and detective Bao Wang Licheng arrested Li Zhang and took her to the police station. However, the accomplices were nowhere to be found. The body was taken to the autopsy room of Tongren Fuyuan Branch for examination. On Sunday, Prosecutor Wu Xiaoke of the Second Special Court was requested to come to the scene to confirm that the death was caused by the beating. Because the deceased's husband claimed he could not afford to handle the funeral arrangements, the official instructed that the body be handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for funeral and burial. After the examination, the police immediately escorted Li Zhang to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi explained the situation and filed charges according to Article 296 of the Criminal Law, requesting a postponement for further investigation. Shao Mingde, the deceased's husband, also recounted the tragic circumstances of his wife's beating. Judge Li Changnian briefly questioned the defendant and then ordered a postponement for continued questioning on May 2nd. The defendant was taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Ferryboat Violently Hit by a Vessel</h3>
<p>Four People Fall into the Water</p>
<p>Rescued by the Lissen</p>
<p>At 12:00 PM on the 20th, Yang Gengen and Zhang Abing were rowing a ferryboat to transport passengers across the Huangpu River in Dongjiadu. At that time, a vessel with the registration number 4964, steered by Du, was sailing with the wind. It struck the ferryboat, causing the boat and passengers to fall into the water. Upon realizing the accident, the vessel immediately sped away. Fortunately, Luo Abing and all the crew of the Lissen, which belongs to the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau, immediately deployed lifeboats and provided assistance, rescuing all those who fell into the water, allowing them to survive. They also chased the vessel that caused the accident to Gaochang Temple before capturing it. They were then handed over to the Water Patrol Team for investigation. The righteous and courageous actions of the Lissen crew are commendable.</p>
<h3>Methods for Film Censorship Committee to Inspect Films in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Film Association requested the Film Censorship Committee to send personnel to Shanghai to review new films during the period when traffic between Beijing and Shanghai is disrupted. This request was forwarded to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior for instructions. In addition to dispatching personnel from both ministries, together with instructors from the Central Propaganda Committee, to take the first bus from Beijing to Hangzhou on the 21st and arrive in Shanghai around the 22nd to inspect new films, the following is a summary of the methods approved by the two ministries: (1) If traffic between Beijing and Shanghai has not resumed by May 31st of this year, the association may send personnel to Shanghai twice for inspection. Each time, the association shall designate one member from the Central Propaganda Committee and one member from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior who also serve as members of the association to be stationed in Shanghai for inspection, limited to five days. During this period, both Chinese and foreign film companies may apply for their new films to be reviewed. After approval by these members, a temporary permit will be issued, allowing the film to be screened in designated cinemas for three to seven days. Upon expiration, the respective companies shall transport the original film to the capital to apply to the association for formal inspection. This temporary measure shall cease by May 31st of this year at the latest and shall not be taken as a precedent. (2) For each film inspected in Shanghai, the applicant shall pay a special inspection fee, the amount of which shall be 40% of the original inspection fee (ten yuan for every 500 meters, with any portion less than 500 meters counted as 500 meters).

<p>Danyang: This spring, Japanese bandits claimed military action and invaded Shanghai. Although our 19th Route Army relied on containing their fierce flames and stripping their violent souls, the Shanghai people suffered increasingly from disasters and hardships. Various charitable organizations and native place associations in Shanghai promoted the idea of relieving hunger and helping the distressed, providing rescue and care in many ways and sparing no effort. In the past two months, displaced people have been able to settle down, and those in difficulty have received support. The Danyang Native Place Association in Shanghai has also risen to rescue and assist fellow villagers, sending them back to their hometown in eight batches, totaling over 3,000 people. To look back on the past and think about the future, without records, who would know the benevolence? Therefore, the major aspects of disaster relief and hardship assistance in Shanghai were compiled into a volume. Under the leadership of Han Jingqi, director of the association's document section, the beginning and end were compiled and published in the monthly relief issue. It will be published within days. Those who wish to obtain a copy can write directly to the association at Minyong Lane, Nanjing Road, and it will be sent immediately.</p>

<h3>Notorious Child Abductor Li Sanguan Captured</h3>
<p>Conspiring with Gu Qiaosheng to Lure a Boy from Liuhe to Shanghai</p>
<p>The notorious child abductor Li Sanguan, a native of Zha Pu, usually colludes with accomplices to lure boys and girls from various rural Fujian areas and sell them in Xiamen, Fujian. Recently, Li, along with accomplice Gu Qiaosheng, abducted a boy named Sheng Danan from Liuhe. They brought him to Shanghai and hid him in the Gongxing Inn in Cunshan Lane, Shangshi Guanqiao, intending to ship him to Xiamen for sale. However, their plan was discovered. At around 9:00 PM the night before last, someone secretly reported this to the local police station in District One, requesting an arrest. Upon receiving the report, District Chief Wang ordered squad leader Dong Mingde and other detectives to go to the inn, where they arrested the child abductors Li Sanguan and Gu Qiaosheng, and brought the abducted boy Sheng Danan back to the district. During the preliminary interrogation by the district chief, Sheng Danan claimed to be five years old, from Jiaxing, and that his father opened a shoe store in Liuhe. He could not provide further details. When questioned, Li Sanguan confessed to being 39 years old and admitted to abducting Sheng Danan with the intention of selling him in Xiamen.

<h3>Compatriots Should Use Nationally-Made Horse Brand Miniature Light Bulbs</h3>
<p>The Xinhua Light Bulb Factory in Taihe Lane, Bailier Road, French Concession, has been producing domestically-made Horse Brand miniature light bulbs for flashlights for the past two years. They are affordable and of excellent quality, far surpassing imported products. It is hoped that compatriots will compete to purchase them in order to protect our interests. It has recently been heard that some unscrupulous merchants, now that Jianyi has not yet recovered, have ordered large quantities of inferior goods worth millions. How can they be so forgetful?</p>
<h3>Company Brand Cigarettes Sell Well</h3>
<p>Company brand cigarettes are manufactured by Ruilun Tobacco Company in this city. After ten years of research and five years of improvement, the cigarette flavor is mild and suitable.

<h3>Proposal to Build Xiaode Road</h3>
<p>Bo Han</p>
<p>American aviator Xiaode rose up angrily to protect world peace. He fought Japanese aircraft in the skies of Jinshan, and finally died in the wilderness because he was outnumbered. Our government, to express respect and gratitude, consulted Xiaode's mother and publicly buried Xiaode's remains in Hongqiao, Shanghai. Xiaode's mother traveled across the ocean to personally attend the grand ceremony. Thus, the two great republics facing each other on the east and west coasts of the Pacific Ocean will see their friendship and international relations strengthened. The spiritual and material cooperation between China and the United States did not begin today. Historical records bear this out. The names of the streets in Shanghai are mostly named after figures related to Chinese history. There are many who have contributed to our country. If we can think of the meaning behind the names when we travel, we should be able to feel the admiration or emotion for our predecessors. Roads such as Lahn Road, Hart Road, Scott Road, and Aierjin all represent a Westerner in modern times, each with their own deeds to study. Furthermore, in China, those who have military achievements are Major Gordon and General Ward, one British and one American, who both shine in our history. Among them, Ward's deeds are particularly prominent. Ward led the Changsheng Army with thousands of soldiers, fought in the southeast, and settled Shanghai. He later died in Songjiang. The capital issued an order to commend him and build a temple for him, with sacrifices in spring and autumn. Ward is the only foreigner with blue eyes and yellow beard who receives sacrifices from China. However, Ward and Gordon were raised by the Manchus to pacify Hong and Yang, which was still Chinese killing Chinese. How can it be compared to Xiaode, who resented the Japanese and mourned the poisoning of the innocent? He raised his arms and did not care for his own safety, defending international justice for the world as a neutral person and eradicating the powerful. His fame cannot be compared with Ward. Now that Shanghai already has roads such as Gordon Road and Ward Road, I believe that a major thoroughfare should be selected in the newly developed area of ​​western Shanghai and given a good name to show permanent observation. As for the soldiers who died in our country this time, road names should also be gradually added to make them immortal.</p>
<h3>Recording Precious Screens in the Old Palace</h3>
<p>Chen Yichan, an old man from Shu, is skilled in cypress matters and proficient in appraisal. Recently, he was visiting Shanghai. Yesterday I passed by his residence, and he had just acquired a treasure-inlaid screen from the old palace. After I had the opportunity to observe it, I was secretly delighted that Zuo had no limit. Record it to tell the readers.</p>
<p>This screen has a total of eight panels. It is nine feet high and about two feet wide. The screen frame is made of rosewood. The middle is plated with carved lacquer panels. The lacquer panels are inlaid with precious stones, jade, coral, colored jade, etc. The precious stones are all carved into objects. Everything is complete, including people, objects, birds, animals, flowers, grass, insects, and fish. The colors are red, green, blue, and purple. The eyes are fascinated by the five colors. There are eight stories on the screen, including the Three Heroes of the Wind and Dust, Su Wu Herding Sheep, Taibai Drunk, Jiemo Writing Poems, Clear Sky Bathing Ducks, Yinghong Touring the Garden, Asking the Way Under Pine Trees, and Asking Qiao After the Horse. The precious stones are all based on their color and size, and describe the shapes of various objects. It is extremely skillful and captures the essence of the craftsman. Especially Taibai in the Taibai Drunk Wine and the eminent monk under the pine tree. One is drowsy with drunkenness, and the other is solemn. The eminent monk's cassock is made of rubies, which is lifelike. It is amazing.</p>
<p>The screen was made during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. It was originally stored in the forbidden palace. Later, Gaozong gave it to his teacher Liu. This object was passed down to the people. Recently, a member of Liu's family brought it to Shanghai. Chan Weng bought it with a lot of money. Objects get their masters. No wonder Chan Weng is happy. I heard that the old man will put this screen in a high study for art critics to appreciate. This journal will compile and print a large 60th anniversary special issue on April 30th. I hope that all fellow writers will contribute their works. Whether it is anecdotes, stories, legends, novels, miscellaneous feelings, essays, illustrations, etc., all are welcome. The number of words per article is still 500 words. Please send it before the 29th of this month. Once recorded, the remuneration will be generous.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai War and Military Equipment (16) One, Tibet</h3>
<p>Unmanned aircraft means aircraft that do not require human power and are equipped with radio driving. After Marconi invented radio telegraph in 1897, the British physicist Wilson created unmanned radio-controlled automatic boats. Later, due to the advancement of electricity, it was renewed every day and gradually reached practical application. However, although this type of aircraft has not yet appeared, it is said that military strategists have researched it to success. As modern military equipment advances, it becomes more and more peculiar. In terms of radio technology used in the military, such as artillery equipment, sound source positioning machines for reconnaissance of enemy situations, rotating machines, panorama telescope theodolites. Various measuring machines. Wired and wireless telegraph and telephone in communication materials. Invisible light communication devices for secret communication. Optical telephone signal machine. And the use of invisible light to warn positions can find targets. Perspective cameras for taking smoke and fog, etc. Finding camouflage and electric current Anti-aircraft electrical listening devices for wire nets. Air lighting. And various power machines, etc. There are countless types of military applications that use electro-optics. For example, the anti-aircraft guns used recently can fire a large number of bullets in an instant to attack enemy aircraft. This is due to the electrical linkage, which enables observers to calculate on the machine. Even on dark nights and thick fog, observation can be done with the help of airborne acoustic listening devices and spotlights. With the advancement of radio telegraph, such as short-wave, ultra-short-wave, high-speed communication and heavy communication, etc., the invention of electrical photography and television devices for military use is gradually being developed. Therefore, the rear command post can use electrical photography and television methods to understand the situation in front. There are also direction detectors to detect the configuration of enemy communication stations and infer the enemy's deployment. Because of the sharpness of various electro-optical effects and scientific craftsmanship, the completion of unmanned aircraft is promoted to meet the needs of the times.</p>
<h3>National Hatred and Family Hatred (3) Wang Tianhen</h3>
<p>The earth was controlled even more closely by darkness and terror, and his heart was naturally even more flustered. But unexpectedly, after crawling for half an hour, he calmed down and carefully discerned, only to cry out in pain. It turned out that the direction he was walking was gradually opposite to the direction of his residence. When he calmed down and carefully discerned, he realized that he was getting farther and farther away from his residence. Anxious, he couldn't help but shed two lines of hot tears. If he wanted to turn back, his body was exhausted, and there was great danger. How could he take the risk and sacrifice himself in a muddle? But his old mother and young son were at home. How could he not risk going back? At this time, he was in a dilemma. He sat on the ground and cried for a while. Thinking that his old mother and young son might die, he couldn't help but cry bitterly!</p>
<p>But crying was useless. He realized this, decided to disregard the danger, tried his best to endure the pain, and still tried to find his way back. Unexpectedly, after crawling for a long time, he was finally blocked by stray bullets; and he also went the wrong way, and finally couldn't crawl home; and the sky finally brightened.</p>
<p>After dawn, the surrounding scenery could be seen clearly. It was truly miserable! Countless flustered refugees, just like himself in the night, were running in different directions, some running east and some running west. The sound of gunfire was still crackling, and the sound of planes was more frequent and louder than at night. The roar was endless, and the buildings in all directions were constantly emitting thick smoke and catching fire, reflecting the sky into a large red area. The thick smoke was like fog, covering the earth. He and countless refugees seemed to be facing the end of the world, not knowing where to die! At this time, he was extremely exhausted, as if he had become paralyzed. He looked at his former residence from afar, which was still very far away! But he also saw from afar that the location of his former residence was also ablaze with fire. The flames seemed to be burning his house, his heart, and the pain in his heart was more intense than the pain of his skin being broken and bleeding on his hands and face!</p>
<p>His former residence could only be viewed from afar and could not be reached! He had endured the pain and crawled all night. He couldn't stand up. He was indeed like a paralysis, unconsciously lying on the side of the road. Countless refugees passed by him, one by one as if they didn't see him, only caring about escaping for their lives. After a long time, he finally heard someone calling anxiously and panickedly in his ears: "Zhenzhong!" 丨his courtesy name丨 "Dad!" Calling like this. He opened his eyes and saw three people beside him. He couldn't help but jump up and say: "Am I in a dream?"</p>
<p>"Why are you here?" His brother-in-law Tai Qinjiang said.</p>
<p>"I thought you were already... why are you sleeping here?" His mother said with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Dad! Why is your face covered in blood and dirt! Dad!" His young son Xiong'er also said with tears.</p>
<p>"Am I not dreaming!" He stared at them. Said again. "Is it really not a dream?"</p>
<p>"Zhenzhong! Why do you say it's a dream? Thanks to Qinjiang, he took us out and escaped, hiding east and west, suffering all night! Why did you disappear? When did you come out? I thought you had already met with misfortune. I didn't expect to meet you here. This is really God protecting us in the dark!" said the mother.</p>

<h3>Minor Setbacks in Financial and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>The rumor that Holland was considering withdrawing funds from the United States caused a slight drop in yesterday's gold price. The situation remained chaotic, but the morning market seemed to return to calm, with only three or four taels fluctuating. Initially, the silver market rose in British currency and remained stable in US currency, so there was no decline. However, it later weakened from its strength due to loose exchange rates and some selling by the Dalian group. Subsequently, buying activity pushed prices higher. The afternoon market was turbulent. The rumor that Holland was withdrawing funds from the United States created a sense of unease. Furthermore, the exchange rate was quite strong, with supply exceeding demand, causing a sharp drop of ten taels, breaking the 710-tael mark. Finally, a certain bank bought more than 300 bars of spot gold, pushing the price back above the 10-tael mark. The situation was volatile and unpredictable. The daily situation is detailed below:</p>
<p>Quiet Opening with No Drastic Changes: The six-month opening was slightly higher by three mace, at 713.5 taels. Large bars rebounded by 3/16. US silver remained unchanged. Private telegrams reported 1/8, but this had little impact. Zhifeng, Yongyu, He, and others were the first to enter, raising the price to 17.5 taels. Sellers did not hesitate, immediately dropping it to 14.2 mace. Suddenly, Tongtai, Changheng, Yuanfu, Chang, and others came to buy, and the silver company absorbed 1,875 US dollars for May and 125 for June, which were sold from Mumbai. The US dollar for July was settled at 8,125, and the gold price jumped by four taels to 19.3 mace. Later, the Dalian group and Hongkang, Yong, and others sold off, pushing the price down by more than three taels. At 9:30 AM, both British and American listings were unremarkable, remaining at 15 taels. Mumbai entered 75 British gold for June and 8,125 for the near term, with both buying and selling possible. Zhifeng, Yongbing, Xing, Hongkang, Yongyuantai, and others bought, immediately raising the price to 17.8 mace. After 9:45 AM, Yuehe, Richang, Futai, Hengqian, Changxiang, Tongtai, Wanxing, and others all sold, likely due to the loosening of the August US dollar at 5,625, causing the market to weaken suddenly, dropping by 5 taels and 0 mace. At 10:30 AM, it was 12.4 mace. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of three taels, with different firms reporting different figures. It was not until 11:00 AM that the price started to rise. Yuhe, Fuyu, Hongkang, Yongcheng, Fengyong, Yuanmaoyong, and others tended to buy in, with Sumitomo absorbing 875 British gold for June and Huabi absorbing 4,375 US dollars for July, thus raising the price by five to six taels.

The stated price was still 780 taels, with discounts ranging from 64-65 taels to 62 taels, later to 68 taels, and around 60 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Large Fluctuations in the Afternoon Market: The afternoon opening was 19.8 mace, but there were very few transactions and it was difficult to sell. The rumor that Holland was withdrawing funds from the United States made sentiment weak. There were more sellers than buyers, such as Dadecheng, Richang, Yifeng, Yuhe, and others who had not sold. Furthermore, the exchange market was loose, with 6,875 US dollars for August sold to banks. If settled at 625, the market sentiment was extremely sluggish, with a rapid decline to 10.3 mace at 2:30 PM. Later, Yifengyong, Hongkangyong, Yuanmaoyong, and others came to buy, pulling the price up by more than four taels to 14.7 mace at 2:50 PM.

Furthermore, British gold was settled at 9,375, and Huabi absorbed eight ounces for July, causing a drop of more than six taels, falling to 08.5 mace by 4:10 PM.

The gold price rose by more than four taels in an instant to 13 taels, with fluctuations of more than two taels shortly after. At 4:20 PM, it was 10.08 to 13 taels. By the closing at 4:30 PM, it was 11.2 mace, a further decrease of two taels from the previous day. Hengxing continued to buy, raising it to 13 taels. The situation was confusing and difficult to grasp. The highest price of the day was 719.8 taels, and the lowest was 708.5 taels, a difference of 11.3 taels. The quoted price was down 60 to 70 taels.

<h3>A Disguised Request for Romance</h3>
<p>— A Warning to Fools</p>
<p>Recently, a classified advertisement in this newspaper's employment section, titled "Hiring Art Teacher," stated:</p>
<p>"A certain gentleman, a university professor, has ample free time in the afternoon and intends to study makeup, walking, and painting to cultivate his temperament. He is specifically seeking a young female art teacher for 20 hours per month, after lunch, with a monthly stipend of 20 to 30 yuan."</p>
<p>It is indeed true that art can cultivate one's temperament. After lunch, during the professor's free time, engaging in painting studies is quite appropriate. Serving in Shanghai, after completing one's inherent work, living alone feels uninteresting, and traveling around is wasteful. Learning to paint is the best way to restrain the mind and body while also pleasing one's temperament.</p>
<p>However, the teacher's qualifications are too strict. In my opinion, anyone who is an artist with painting experience is suitable, regardless of gender, age, male or female, old or young. Why insist on only seeking women, and only young women? Do young women possess more artistic talent and skill, and is their teaching method particularly superior and different from others? However, the gentleman is only in the initial stages of learning, so he does not need such an outstanding teacher. Anyone with a little knowledge of painting can serve as an instructor. In the ten miles of the foreign field, there are countless people who understand painting and can wield a few strokes. Advertisements appear in the morning, and responses arrive in the evening. Why insist on young women as a condition, abandoning the easy and pursuing the difficult?</p>
<p>Furthermore, there are many ways to cultivate one's temperament, such as music, chess, poetry, and calligraphy. All can be learned, and all can cultivate one's temperament. Is it only painting that has the possibility of cultivating one's temperament? Now, for the sake of cultivating his temperament, he must learn to paint, and to learn to paint, he must have a young woman as a tutor. Does the cultivation of temperament through painting become twice as effective once taught by a young woman? However, there is no such reason.</p>
<p>Therefore, I am thinking for the gentleman. If he is committed to painting in order to cultivate his temperament and is seeking a teacher, then this advertisement is almost equal to zero. Truly talented and skilled young women in art will not covet the meager monthly salary of 20 to 30 yuan to demean themselves and condescend to teach. On the other hand, those who are willing to gracefully condescend and apply are those who have no real knowledge. This reason is very clear. If so, then the recruiter will still find it difficult to fulfill his desire for learning. If the drunkard's intention is not in the wine, but simply wants to use the recruitment of a teacher as a name to conduct a romantic experiment, then it is better to be straightforward and write "Seeking Girlfriend," "Seeking Lover," "Seeking..." etc., which would be much more straightforward.</p>

<h3>Poem on the Death of Battalion Commander Luo</h3>
<p>— Mengshao'an Wangzhu</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Luo Kun of the First Battalion of the 78th Division died in the Xiaochangmiao battle on March 1st. In this battle, the Japanese soldiers attacked our battalion's position with all their might. The battalion commander fought to the death, killing 700 enemies. The news reached us more than a month later. This poem is to mourn him.</p>
<p>The battlefield is silent during the day, the sky is ashen,</p>
<p>Stubborn clouds press down on the formation, the formation does not open.</p>
<p>Thousands of butterflies suddenly fly out, (Butterfly soldiers are Japanese bandits, see the History of Ming)</p>
<p>The sound of killing is like the sea,排空而来,</p>
<p>Fire and lightning explode from the nine heavens and nine earths,</p>
<p>The lone army resists the wall,危一髮,</p>
<p>The public anger makes a sound,万鬼瘖,</p>
<p>Fights to kill the bandits first,</p>
<p>The bandits see the public come,疑飞神,</p>
<p>All the puppets are on the ground,</p>
<p>Our army is like a dragon, the enemy is like grass,</p>
<p>The big call 陷阵山 for 倒,</p>
<p>Till morning till noon, the war does not 疲,</p>
<p>The enemy army of 700 are all meat 糜,</p>
<p>The public force is not exhausted, the gun suddenly breaks,</p>
<p>In his hand, there are still a few bullets,</p>
<p>Wrapped in sores and fighting again, the armor is all red,</p>
<p>This heart and blood are all melted into iron,</p>
<p>貫日雄虹万丈起,</p>
<p>汉家虎将终战死,</p>
<p>That night, our army's drums did not Yang,</p>
<p>The whole army retreats thirty 里,</p>
<p>It is a pity that the crowd is too different,</p>
<p>Otherwise, who can pull the five peaks,</p>
<p>The battlefield after the 劫者愁,</p>
<p>莽苍不可收,</p>
<p>I do not know what is the public bone,</p>
<p>The sky is阴雨湿魂咿嘠,</p>
<p>安得起公　　貅,</p>
<p>往集餘燼剪我仇,</p>
<p>侧身西望徒繁忧,</p>

<p>The Bronze Di was stroked for twenty years,</p>
<p>With a wave of his hand, he turned Jianghai into Du Fanchuan.</p>
<p>The world in between the lines has changed,</p>
<p>Still, he bows to the cuckoo in the empty forest.</p>
<p>White hair and a cane bed, he hasn't returned at night,</p>
<p>Tears fill the Qin court, the old minister's clothes.</p>
<p>The breeze and moon over Wushan are unharmed,</p>
<p>Tell the western crows not to fly at night.</p>

<h3>Assassinate Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuzun</p>
<p>Reports state that Ma Zhanshan is a minister in the puppet Manchukuo government. The people of the country are saddened by Ma Zhanshan's lack of a good end and resent Zhang Xueliang's inaction. Therefore, this poem is composed. March Yesterday, a loyal minister is today a traitor. Although the tombs are lonely, the Han Dynasty betrayed virtue. A person's honor and disgrace are not worth discussing. When the節 has fallen, it is a pity. The waters under Heilongjiang are 潺湲, as if sighing deeply for the general.</p>
<h3>Encourage General Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhuzun</p>
<p>Today's report states that General Ma Zhanshan has sent a telegram continuing to resist the Japanese. The people of the country commend him for this. This poem is composed on April 14th.</p>
<p>Last year, I wrote a poem praising the general,</p>
<p>The other day, I wrote a poem condemning the general.</p>
<p>Today, I write a poem encouraging the general.</p>
<p>Alas, may General Ma be encouraged!</p>
<p>Since the barbarians have come to the three provinces,</p>
<p>The main generals have heard of non-resistance.</p>
<p>The people of the country despise them like pigs.</p>
<p>The great humiliation of the world falls on them.</p>
<p>Only you, sir, shook your arm on the Black River,</p>
<p>And fought bloodily for months, performing wonders.</p>
<p>The people's songs soar to the sky,</p>
<p>榆粟捐财何缤纷,</p>
<p>英名赫赫中天县,</p>
<p>家家买丝绣平原,</p>
<p>铜像峥嵘遍城邨,</p>
<p>香烟聲名尤赫喧,</p>
<p>Independent support is difficult to support a large building.</p>
<p>The entire army re-formed and returned to Hailun.</p>
<p>Being loyal to the Han and following one's heart is the best.</p>
<p>It's a pity that Puyi is昏復昏,</p>
<p>Willing to turn Manchuria into Korea.</p>
<p>When you occasionally entered and exited the puppet country's gates,</p>
<p>People scolded you for raising the banner of surrender.</p>
<p>Although I doubted you, I could not argue.</p>
<p>Three men speaking in the market say there are crouching tigers.</p>
<p>Writing a poem to刺君 is still doubtful of injustice.</p>
<p>One should leave righteousness to the universe.</p>
<p>Now I have read your declaration,</p>
<p>Truly, your heart is forgivable.</p>
<p>The sun and moon pass through the heavens, and things come to swallow them.</p>
<p>In a moment, the light will illuminate all directions.</p>
<p>世人宁得轻輊轩,</p>
<p>I hope you will work hard to restore national sovereignty.</p>
<p>大复国仇报国恩,</p>
<p>Riches and honor are floating clouds, what is enough to say?</p>
<p>Only loyalty and righteousness are the nation's soul,</p>
<p>Protecting it will strengthen the country, and losing it will ruin it.</p>
<p>I have the Spring and Autumn annals in my poetic pen,</p>
<p>And I will write in large letters the five generals of the Republic of China:</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan, Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, Tan Qixiu, and Weng Zhaoyuan.</p>

<h3>Continued Smoke Screen Shells</h3>
<p>— Yun Juan</p>
<p>Smoke screen shells can not only provide concealment to avoid enemy attacks, but also can be used to assist in military operations, such as: ambushes, troop movements, and replacing military orders. Because soldiers are lying in trenches, it is sometimes difficult to issue orders effectively. Using the color of smoke to represent military orders is more effective. It can also make the enemy believe it is poison gas, forcing them to wear masks, thereby reducing the enemy's combat capability. (During the European war, smoke screen shells were often used in conjunction with poison gas to make it impossible for the enemy to identify which type of poison gas it was.)</p>
<p>Tetrachlorotin (SnCl4) is the most common of these, and a manufacturing method was previously described by Li Jun in this publication. However, there is a simpler method than the one described by Li Jun: (1) It can be made from stannous chloride (SnCl2) plus aqua regia. This method is widely used commercially; it forms crystals, known as strong tin. (2) A small piece of tin, add a small amount of hydrochloric acid (if it is too slow, it can be heated slightly). Separately, add two cubic centimeters of ferric chloride to five cubic centimeters of water. Then, add the above tin solution drop by drop until a color change occurs, and a white, thick smoke will be obtained. The chemical formula is as follows:</p>
<p>2FeCl3 SnCl2 2FeCl2 SnCl4</p>
<p>Ferric chloride Stannous chloride Ferrous chloride Tetrachlorotin</p>
<p>In addition to being used for smoke screens, tetrachlorotin is often used as a mordant. Therefore, it is also very important in the dyeing industry.</p>

<h3>Miss and Old Maid</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Because the spring breeze has blown away the war clouds over Shanghai and bestowed infinite warmth on the noble citizens, Miss Li, as usual, led her own old maid (a potential nanny) back lazily from the park.</p>
<p>At the corner of a road, several fundraising teams were standing in front of a small cigarette and paper shop, as could be seen from the flags. One of the young women was pleading to the people in this way: "We have all been fired by the Japanese textile mill. If we don't work for a day, we don't eat for a day. We ourselves can sometimes endure being hungry, but the children at home cry all day long, which is truly heartbreaking... Please donate a little to do a good deed and save lives!"</p>
<p>This kind of tearful crying, in the eyes of our noble Miss Li, was truly ridiculous; first of all, they are workers, and what does it matter if a worker temporarily has no food to eat because of national affairs? ... So she just sneered and left them. Of course, the fundraisers could only "save their breath" to her.</p>
<p>Not far away, she discovered that her old maid was panting and chasing after her from a distance. This was simply worth her throwing a tantrum.</p>
<p>"Why do you always like to get involved with them? You low-life!" "No, they are too pitiful. I donated all my two yuan wages to them."</p>
<p>"Damn thing!" A palm print was left on the old maid's face. "You have so much spare money? I'll make sure they don't give you a single penny in the future!"</p>
<p>But the old maid firmly believed: she herself had worked as a worker, so only she understood the suffering of the workers. The young lady was the daughter of a large family, she would never know and would never want to know their lives. So, this is the difference between "Miss" and "Old Maid".</p>

<h3>Saving the Nation Through Food</h3>
<p>— Chen Jiyun</p>
<p>Since the market opened on April 1st, all sectors and industries have expressed their patriotism, all claiming to "endure pain and resist for the long term." In reality, they are all profiting from the name of national crisis! The day before yesterday, I went out on business and sat quietly in the tram. I suddenly found a calendar on my body. Taking it out to look at it, I realized it was an advertisement for XXX, a promotional item using a calendar. The calendar had the four characters "Saving the Nation Through Food" written on it. After reading it, I felt that this merchant was very enthusiastic about saving the nation. Our people should be twelve thousand times grateful.</p>
<p>We know that if it is called food, it must certainly be able to fill the stomach. However, this kind of food (seasonal fruits, weekly delicacies...) is not essential, and is entirely extra food for the rich, which can be said to be eaten for fun.</p>
<p>In this time of national crisis, everything must embrace a tight policy. As for food, it is best to adopt a one-dish system, save some money, and purchase some defensive items. Purchase practical and effective military supplies for the country. It is found that what our country is currently most threatened by are warships, cannons, and aircraft. Defending against enemy aircraft dropping bombs is the most urgent task at present. In view of the traces of devastation left by Japanese aircraft rampant in Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, and other places, for the sake of self-defense and national defense, regardless of whether this meeting is successful or not, we should quickly raise funds and engage in air defense facilities. In the event of an emergency, in addition to the national defense of the positions, all households and shops can be spared from the trampling of enemy aircraft, which is better than unnecessary food in the stomach. Therefore, this kind of food is enough to destroy the country.</p>
