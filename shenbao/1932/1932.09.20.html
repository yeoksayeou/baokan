<p>時評</p>
<h3>國際聯盟之運命</h3>
<p>微</p>
<p>當去年九一八事件發生以後。我國政府訴請國際聯盟對暴日嚴加制裁之時。世人咸目此舉爲對國聯能力之一種重大試騐。今事隔一年。中日問題反有變本加厲之情勢。而國聯則依然如故。然則國聯果有能力乎。曰否。果無能力乎。曰否。何也曰。國聯雖爲世界各國之集合體。而其事權則悉操之少數强國之手。凡弱小國間之爭執。國聯自有能力以解决之。若爭執者一爲强國。一爲弱國。國聯猶能設法以敷衍之。至若强國與强國之爭。則國聯將無容喙之餘地矣。</p>
<p>自聯盟成立以來。已十餘年矣。加入之國家。爲數雖已達五十四國然因世界二大强國。美與蘇俄。始終未允參加。故其能力之微薄。自無待言。猶幸常任行政委員之英法意德日五國。尙能保持相當之聯絡。故國聯對於解决諸小國之爭端。亦猶得舉相當之成績。如瑞典芬蘭間之氷島事件。波蘭立陶宛間之維爾那問題。以及意大利對希臘之哥甫事件。英國對土耳其之摩塞爾問題等。皆其著者也。</p>
<p>及去年中日事件發生。國際聯盟確受重大之威脅。陷於困難之地位。蓋此時爲維持公道起見。確有制裁日本之必要。然而日本强國也。又豈能加以制裁。猶幸我國以和平爲前提。不願輕啓戰端。國聯乃得出其敷衍手段。作派遣調查團之决議。至於今日。國聯尙得依然如故也。</p>
<p>然而最近之國聯。則眞將受嚴重之試騐矣。其受試騐之問題。第一將爲法德之軍備交涉。德國自七月二十日向軍縮會議提出備忘錄。八月三十一日以照會送交法國駐德大使　賽。要求改編德國陸軍。俾與法國漸臻。平等以來。此事巳成爲目前歐洲最重大之問題。德國之要求軍備平等。頗得各國之贊助。認爲合理之要求惟法國及其與國波蘭。則極端反對以爲與凡爾賽對德和約相抵觸。雙方意見。極難融洽。今德國巳致函軍縮會議主席漢德森。謂軍縮平等要求不能實現。德國勢巳不能參加九月二十一日所召集之國聯行政委員會議。德國如不參加國聯行政會議。則國聯勢必受重大之打擊也。</p>
<p>不寗惟是。德國之軍備要求。意國與以極大之援助。據國民社十七日電。意相墨沙尼揚言。如意國主張未能在本屆會議提出討論則意國將退出國聯。此國聯之又一打擊也。</p>
<p>國聯所受嚴重之試騐。其次即爲因日本承認僞國而引起之時局。日本承認僞國。各國輿論。雖大都均不直其所爲。然各國之當局者。則尙暫守緘默。靜待下月中國聯調查團報告書之發表。與國聯應付之態度。惟東京政府。則似巳决定如國聯否認日本主張。即退出國聯。亦所不辭。德意日三國而均退出國聯。則國聯尙能維持其生命乎。</p>
<p>法德意均今世界所目爲强國者也。强國之間。發生糾紛。國際聯盟之難問題也。日本與中國之紛爭。又强力與公道之爭也。維持世界和平之國際機關。其將抑公道而從强力乎。抑抑强力而全公道乎。此亦國際聯盟之難問題也。最近之國聯大會。將受此二問題之嚴重試騐並於此而决定其運命。</p>

<p>電通社十九日東京電　林滿鐡總裁因與軍部並滿鐡社員發生爭執、現蟄居私邸、謝絶一切會面、致拓務當局亦深憂慮、結果林總裁或將自動辭職、</p>
<p>華聯社十九日東京電　據東報所載、日軍部·滿鐡社員·及旅東三省日僑排斥林總裁主要理由有三、（一）林博太郎伯爵到任時、携帶家族及隨員甚衆、宛然與德川時代大名行列一樣無異、濫費金錢過多、不顧在沙塲勞苦之兵士、（二）專門蒐集植物、如植物學敎授光臨東三省、對滿鐡事務不甚關心、處此最嚴重時機、如此總裁只有隱退之一途、（三）林總裁自爲誇大上院預算委員長任命多年、精通滿蒙事情、其實則不過銀樣蠟槍頭耳、絲毫不敷適用、</p>
<p>華聯社十九日東京電　在東京之林滿鐡總裁、日前電令八田副總裁返京、八田竟以滿洲時局嚴重、不能從命答覆、拒絶返京、八田爲政友會系上院議員、初任副總裁時、受軍部排斥甚烈、滿鐡社員亦反對、今則與滿鐡社員·在滿日僑各團體·日軍部等協力驅逐林總裁、其目的在迫齋藤内閣辭職、林總裁問題巳爲日政界重要問題、齋藤與永井須負完全責任、林伯爵之去職、則齋藤内閣之下台亦將不遠、</p>

<p>匯市明定暗緊</p>
<p>套頭交易尙屬敏活</p>
<p>昨週一銀市向例無電、惟隔昨報縮、而匯兌似略堅漲、殆滬市趨勢挺秀、滙豐掛牌悉無更動、惟内盤初堅後鬆、下午由平復緊、結果比較上週六計英金縮一二五、美金僅縮一二五、至一八七五由於匯兌續升、美銀微跌之故、而金價前平後鋒、巳見七百卅二兩之新價、人心頗佳、至於各匯交易尙屬敏活、計英金成交十萬鎊光景、金帮略有出納、孟買曾進近期、而美金或交七八十萬元、前市抛出居多、後市賣而復扒、大致套頭也、美銀公司則進十二月、各銀行如麥加利及日商等均有納進、至上週間各金號復向扒結、因金價旣高、然並非套頭實係以抵前空、迨昨日有所套進條子、以抱穩健之策也、</p>

<p>週初銀洋形勢</p>
<p>此屆星期一、銀行收解情形、未如上次之盛、良以銀根久鬆、用途稀少、故雖星期休假後兩天併理、交易亦不甚緊、至於洋厘市氣、晨間以銀行買賣殷盛、價格仍復上乘、而午市忽然賣氣太旺、以致價難站穩、卒至跌小七五、可見目前尙未到繁用時機、一遇普通疲勢、卽有下游之舉耳▲厘有漲跌拆至白借　「洋厘」早市洋厘爲六錢九分五厘半、較前午突復漲起一厘、午市以形勢滯軟、遂又遞跌七毫半、爲六錢九分四厘七毫半、結果較前早尙好二毫半、「銀拆」早市僅開二分、午市重至白借、劃頭加水四五分、銀根頭襯寬鬆、故近日無升騰之望、</p>
<p>角有漲跌銅元大縮　江南小洋早市爲六錢○一厘、午市爲六錢○四厘、結果較前日反好一厘、做出交易、早市五千角、午市七千角、廣東小洋、早市爲五錢九分、午市爲五錢八分八厘半、結果改好好毫半、交易早市十二萬五千角、午市三萬五千角、銅元飛縮三千文、爲四百二十六千文、兩市間共縮六千文之巨、交易四萬一千三百餘串、</p>
<p>銀洋收解交易狀况　「銀欵」昨日銀行收解計華商收解票欵三百三四十萬、外商收解票欵二百七八十萬、各種貨匯稅雜諸欵收解一千○七八十萬、進倉四十萬、出倉五十萬、押欵交易一百四五十萬、錢莊銀公單收解三千一百餘萬劃頭欵收解四百七十餘萬、各路匯欵九十餘萬、收解現欵扯直、一洋匯匯劃票欵、早市做出七十八萬、午市一百十九萬五千、鈔票早市二萬、午市六萬、場外鈔票早市十四萬午市九萬、支單交易早市五萬、午市四萬、銀行買賣、早市互市八十萬、午市九十五萬、各銀行洋戶往來收解一百七十餘萬、鈔票收回及發出二百二十餘萬、錢莊洋押欵交易六百五十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解二百十餘萬、拆借洋欵進出二百餘萬、客路去胃四十餘萬、小錢莊交易八十餘萬、</p>
<p>證劵　債價後市稍堅</p>
<p>昨（十九日）華商證劵交易所各債市况　現貨惟上午一九善成交三千元、一九關·二○關各一千元、其他全日無市、期貨交易雖比上星期略多、本下月期大致均開出、市面則仍屬平靜、賣買續鮮發展、計前後市成交二百念八萬元、上午兩盤、市場賣買人氣沉悶、求供甚平、價上落甚微、較上週末幾屬毫無變動、惟後市兩盤稍佳零戶從事收進、掉期補進亦略多、故需要較旺、各價一致回堅、結果比上星期多漲二三角不等、債市形勢恐暫時難望發展也、</p>

<h3>紐約股市略跌</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、週六（十七日）紐約股市呈盤旋之狀、上落甚微、初尙堅挺、嗣後大衆預料美國鋼鐡公司本季虧蝕必巨、賣出增多、價乃回落、結果比上日略低、半日成交數共七十萬股、自九月三日至十日一週間、貨車共五○一八二四輛、較前週計减五七九○三輛、此因勞工節休業關係實際上並未减少、故亦未影響股市、觀於物價之不能挺進、及本季　業報告之勢不能盡如人意、則雖有共和黨再度捧起股市之說、市場於最短期内必不能恢復原狀可斷言也、茲錄道瓊斯皆數如左、</p>

<p>孟買　自美棉報告發表後、步跌至今、週内因政局關係及假期之故、形勢混沌、就以後兩月内走動逐漸增加而言、未來狀况、絶少樂觀、歐洲及遠東之出口問訊略增惟在長期不活動之後、其力甚微、收成情形、除聯省外、大致天氣晴朗、卽中央省及中印度兩地、亦頗有進步、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>

<p>糧食　米市形勢轉定</p>
<p>滬南　昨日西路出源不多、約抵念四五號、城鄉銷路比前市爲旺、靑海·風練·亭林等早晚稻、客帮續辦、開盤定局、常錫北粳與蘇同帮胃呆、價形見疲、糯米　舖略有應酬價硬角許、</p>
<p>新閘　米市裏路各帮米船共十七八號、早晨臨市人數極少　常溧厚破頂定、普通貨小去二角、新洋杜尖新粳等貨各低近角、早　稻隨到隨銷、價無上落、全天斛脚約二千三四百石左右、</p>
<p>西貢客化漸活</p>
<p>各米均挺俏</p>
<p>昨日洋米客化轉活、西貢米存底不豐、到頭久絶、市面允　活潑轉機、昨日本街續有少數問津外漢口帮與北帮均有過問、統市開出一千五百包、以漢口與北帮所去占多、小絞米本街進胃亦見轉好昨日辦去一千餘包、市價與前市相近、惟人心與形勢均向上、如今明再有本客暢辦、行情必可上展、西貢米尤有看漲之望、售開西貢一號米九元六角至四角半、小絞米八元六角七分至四角、</p>
<p>粉價難期高昂</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼穩之象、以洋麥報價、互有四五分之出入人心初未見佳、旋因賣氣甚寂、廠家觀望、致人心漸見回振、較前週收價、計漲一分外、迨至下午開盤至三盤、交易甚寂、買賣均不起勁、四盤後交易復見暢傳阜豐信大又合定二號洋麥一船價三兩七錢半因此市場抛貨、又復暢旺、市價亦又步落、觀於廠家對洋麥訂購、未肯放棄、前途終難期高昂也、結果本月份較前週好五厘、十月份好一分、十一十二月份好五厘、一月份好二厘半、二月份好七厘半云、</p>
<p>麥市午後驟呈緊俏</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致盤旋交易亦見寂寞、迨至下午開盤、市氣　呈緊俏、因上午粉市之回俏、又因國外洋麥之報價以東方帮之買進、後步有看好之勢致賣出者均思扳緊、不肯鬆出、人心遂爲帶起、惟此種推測、是否有注意之價值、仍難逆料也、結果本月份較前週好一分十月份好三分、十一月份好五分、十二月份好四分、一月份不動二月份好二分、現麥市面、仍見穩固、開瑤灣麥三兩五錢次至三兩三錢半、無錫麥三兩四錢八分、宿遷麥三兩四錢四分、次至三錢半、計共四千五百包云、</p>

<h3>太平洋各美輪</h3>
<p>華員被裁失業</p>
<p>美政府安揷失業</p>
<p>訓令各航商遵行</p>
<p>世界班已先實施</p>
<p>太平洋内日美兩國、近年競航至烈、各建新船、互奪航權、二八滬戰以後、中美航業尤覺船多貨少、噸位過剩、萬噸巨輪、每次出品、恒祗二三百噸、所入運費、甚有不敷燃料用者、日船營業更衰、所裝不過一二十噸、今以營業之不振、美輪實行緊縮、益以美政府之安揷失業工人、而將太平洋内各美輪中之華員、完全排斥、改用美人、從此美國船中將無華人立足之地、此事與國民生計、所關頗巨、亟將情形、查報如下、</p>
<p>營業不振　滬上太平洋内航行之船、日見其多、而本年添增之特别快班、亦有十餘艘、日商大阪公司且爲爭運中美貨、又造超特快輪東海丸·南海丸·等到滬行駛、處女航甫於昨日開行、因中美行輪過多、遂致出口貨益覺缺少、本年受滬戰打擊、太平洋内各輪無一可以獲利者、在最近七八九月、中美輪每次出口、不過裝載一二百噸貨物、日船更少、每輪祗有六七噸去貨、爲近年罕見之衰落、</p>
<p>美商緊縮　美國航商、爲謀抵制日船爭運計、實施緊縮、以圖永久之對抗、中美一路内航業最巨之大來洋行、業已奉到總行電令、自本月分起、該行所屬之水陸兩部職員、凡屬四人、統行減薪、一律减去百分之十五、實發八五、藉資撙節、以彌補營業之虧耗、</p>
<p>裁汰華員　太平洋内各美輪中所需之管事部與海員部等職工、悉雇華人充任、蓋工作勤而薪金廉也、茲美國政府爲本國失業工人日多、，急謀解决、遂訓令各輪公司着將各船所用之非美人職工、一律裁汰、遺缺安揷本國之失業工人、航行中國各處之世界班美輪、已經開始實行、第一批被解雇之華人、係大來世界船范白倫號中之管事部各華員、人數近百、以粤人居多、均在上海解散上岸、尙有六船中之華員、亦將逐批斥退、儘在三個月内全數辭畢、</p>
<p>全易美人　七世界輪之華員裁汰後、確聞行駛太平洋綫、如舊金山·西雅圖·等路之各美船中的華員、美政府亦令各該船東一律撤調、亦安揷失業之美人、即將繼續世界班輪而實行、從此以後太平洋内美國輪中、殊無華人任職之立足點、而我國航海界又將平增落職之失業者數千人也、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>九三老人馬相伯語錄</p>
<h3>中國的土地問題</h3>
<p>中央研究院楊院長來訪·談到中國的土地問題·相老人就將所擬方案，談了談。</p>
<p>「我國是個文明古國，舉世咸知；所以劃界問題，隨國勢强弱來决定。首先對於境内的土地，是要淸丈測量，纔知道一個實數。」相老人說過。</p>
<p>楊院長接着就說了：「中央研究院社會研究所近曾調查江蘇某地的畝，大小種類，多至百種以上；實在該整頓一下。」</p>
<p>「據天文的經緯度，來測地方的大小，是較準確的。」相老人又加以解釋，講述了一遍。</p>
<p>我略報告了曾世英君新用此法，推算各省區的面積，結果說山東的面積比前人所推算的都大。後相老人申述了主張一番。</p>
<p>相老人提議的新土地法，可約爲兩大原則：丨</p>
<p>第一：地契法的制定相老人稱：「城鎭，或三畝二畝一畝爲一契；農田，或五十畝，三十畝，十五畝爲一契。每縣視通商與肥瘠而殊。契稅，每張四元，留作各縣設農工商官銀行之用；且貧戶可書借劵以貸之。四元之外，加紙張註册費五角，中央與各縣，二三平分。（引所擬憲法撮要；不同）</p>
<p>第二：國防區的徵用　相老人稱：「凡大山大水之傍：須有若干里丈爲國有，否則森林水道與國防皆不能治。」</p>
<h3>忘九</h3>
<p>— 樂山</p>
<p>丨比忘八還小一輩呢！</p>
<p>「月到中秋分外明」，可是今年的中秋，上半夜的月色，却没有一些光明，只深藏在彌漫的愁雲裏，這也許是多情的月姊，不忍把她團圓的光芒，照射到破碎的山河，更不忍看義勇軍們，那種浴血苦戰的悲壯情狀吧！</p>
<p>多愁善感的我，被酒之後，頓覺感慨橫生，拿起一枝秃筆，想寫幾句，聊以遣愁，但是牢騷滿腹，雜感紛起，不知從何落筆，只在一張白紙上，信筆寫了「忘九」兩字。</p>
<p>秀妹走來看了，嫣然一笑道：「題目都寫錯了，還做什麽文章？向來祇有駡人的名詞「忘八」，那裏會有什麽「忘九」呢？</p>
<p>我便胡謅道：「有了從前的「忘八」，自然就有現在的「忘九」，你且聽我道來：</p>
<p>我們許多國恥之中，最悲痛的莫如「五九」，和「九一八」，眞是奇恥大辱，但是健忘的民衆，早又忘得乾乾凈凈了，别的不說，單以劣貨而論，又復充斥市塲，而國人中，不服用劣貨的，能有幾多？而臥薪嘗膽，牢牢地記着「五九」，和「九一八」的，又有幾多人？唉，這豈不是「忘九」嗎？</p>
<p>北伐成功之後，我們時常看到，或聽到：「你不好，打倒你，我來做」！的標語，可是他們，只在口頭空喊，而不肯動手實做，而且把别人打倒之後，到了他自己來做的時候，早又把那「我來做」的「做」字忘記了，因此有人譏爲「忘九」，比「忘八」還要小一輩咧。</p>
<h3>俏皮話</h3>
<p>— 梯公</p>
<p>獸國中鑒於世風日新，凡百落伍，單就服裝而言，已有改善之必要，於是汲汲召集了一改良時裝入會。羣獸畢集，互推時裝大會主席，以摩登化者爲合格。雪獅叭兒狗搖尾而起道：「本席秀髮如雪，髦曲有致、塵世摩登女郎之波紋式，不過爾爾，實有當選資格。」老黄牛昂然道：「鄙人素以提創大奶奶爲宗旨，累累下垂，異常悅目，非比摩登女郎之施以人工手術者。應請諸同志注意。一螳螂攘臂道：一妾身細腰大屁股，亦未敢妄自菲薄。一旁邊一條癩皮狗，急汪汪而作。大家笑道：「你這畜生，莫非也有摩登資格？」癩狗指着自己血淋淋的　條後腿道：「奴家實行不着　主義，香艶肉感，難道算不得摩登之花嗎。」大家恍然大悟，一陣巴掌，便擁護癩皮狗做了時裝大會的主席。</p>
<h3>現代的文藝</h3>
<p>— 殺羽</p>
<p>丨亂世文章怎及畫裏眞眞丨</p>
<p>這似乎太怪異了！在這日本承認僞國，内戰此息彼此，快要實現亡國的我國：書局的橱窗，和街頭的報攤，所陳列的畫報，好似美女月份牌展覽一般，眞是摘粉槎酥，花嬌月媚丨而那健美的少女們的裸體典型，更表現着富麗的藝術色彩！</p>
<p>畫裏眞眞，那個不愛丨何况現代的摩登女郎，都慷慨地把伊們的嬌姿美態，公開昭示庶人尤其是尋出路的小姐們的美感照片開卷瞭然，大享眼福。内心燃着火熖的靑年們，那個不人手一編！</p>
<p>舊體小說似乎失敗了；三角戀愛的新體小說，也銷數大跌，就是那種飽含誘惑性的肉林秘記等說部大觀，也消失了以前風行的盛况，和畫報比起來，顯然是相形見絀了。於是昔日暢消的小說雜誌，没落得好似曉後晨星，在挣扎着最後殘喘</p>
<p>有人說：現代的結合的藝術，第一要推電影，好的無聲電影，也不需要許多的說明文字，何况現在盛行的ＡＬＬＳＩＮging，alltalking，alldancing的有聲電影，自然更不需要文字。現代的文藝，當然逃不了這個公例哩！何况麻木的人們，正需要剌激性的藝術東西，自然文字不及圖畫了。</p>
<h3>國文課</h3>
<p>— 金不同</p>
<p>丨講堂的寫眞丨</p>
<p>戴着老光眼鏡的王先生，挾着國文講義，到三年級課堂裏上課。　　王先生剛踏進敎室，猛然的給一個學生撞了一個滿懷，幾乎把眼鏡撞下鼻梁來，接着全課堂起了一陣哈哈的大笑，王先生若無其事的把眼鏡望上推了一推，依然很安詳的跨上講台，翻出點名簿來，一一的點下去，全班三十三，居然一個不缺。</p>
<p>這時有一個很粗糙的聲音，從末排上發出：「王先生，一個都不缺麽？怎麽我數來數去，祗有二十一人呢？好，王先生呑餉！」王先生只裝没聽見，翻講開義來，說道：「今天講「秋聲賦」，這是篇空前絶後的妙文，你們大家靜心細聽！」</p>
<p>「好，大家洗耳恭聽！今天王先生講「秋老虎」」後排那個聲音很粗糙的學生，帶着滑稽的口吻這樣說。大家聽了鬨堂大笑。</p>
<p>「不，王先生講雄老虎丨」又一個學生接着說，於是笑聲越發大了，而同時呢，所有的男生的目光，不約而同的集注在前排的六位女生身上，嚇得女生們，都不敢回過頭來。</p>
<p>「不准胡說！誰再胡說，要記過了。」王先生發怒了，於是有的攤着一本「啼笑姻緣」，津津的研究；有的用手拍着桌面，輕輕地哼着「打魚殺家」；有的用自來墨水筆，鬼鬼祟祟的大寫其情書：有的索性把頭伏在臂上，呼呼地打起瞌睡來了，這樣，才把空氣沉寂了一些。</p>
<p>待到鐘聲一響，王先生把眼鏡又往上輕輕一推，急急的挾着講義下課；學生們都伸了一個懶腰，對王先生的背影扮鬼臉。</p>
<h3>說部扶輪會銀絲（十九）</h3>
<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>「自殺！……殺人！」他在默念，他覺悟都不應該用諸現在，自殺是表示卑怯，懦弱；殺人是應該到疆塲上去殺敵國的仇人。正在這時候，芬若下樓了，手中還拿着一個小小的包裹</p>
<p>「怎麽！」伊狠驚惶而突然停步，伊己瞧見他的面色狠不好看，「你怎麽啦？」</p>
<p>「我想把這枝槍寄在你這裏，佩了槍去參加這典禮，似乎有失體統。」袁團長狠聰明的掩飾着，當眞把槍交給芬若</p>
<p>「是不是你也送給我，要交換做一個紀念？」芬若有些不自然，但是依然去接着手槍。</p>
<p>「你假使喜歡它，送給你也可以，但是你送些什麽東西給我呢？」</p>
<p>芬若走到桌子旁邊，鄭重地把手槍和包裹放下，「這是我十幾年來的心血，請你小心地」</p>
<p>保藏了吧。」伊一壁說。一壁把包裹批開。</p>
<p>「啊！這是你的繡像，總是你自己繡的了。」</p>
<p>「是的，那一幅是給你繡的像，因爲我繡這兩個像的時候，總是在深夜，所以一個人也没有瞧見過這還是憑着我的記憶力，在每一次想像中，摹擬着而繡的，也許不能狠像，請你原諒吧！」</p>
<p>「像極了，眞和照的相片一樣！」袁團長雙手把這兩張繡片，遞得遠一些，左看右看，愛不釋手。</p>
<p>芬若默然地在端相着袁團長的神態，仿佛出了神，却不在體會他欣喜的表情。</p>
<p>「可惜！……可惜！」袁團長在自言自語。</p>
<p>「可惜什麽？」</p>
<p>「可惜没有繡軍裝，可惜繡得太年輕了。」袁團長似乎愛惜自己的華年，已像逝水一般地過去了</p>
<p>「不是我已說過了麽？我是摹擬着年輕時候的袁和甫先生，而不是繡的今日之袁團長。」</p>
<p>「唉！靑春已過去了，但是你瞧，我白髮都上鬢了。」袁團長指着他頭上幾絲白髮。</p>
<p>「當然，你在戰塲上，是何等地辛苦呢！」芬若說着，忽然凝神地思想，便在桌子抽斗裏取出一方缺了一隻角的鏡子，照着自己的面容。</p>
<p>「你的美麗，却還不曾改變。袁團長走上前看看鏡子裏芬若的神態。」</p>
<p>「眞的麽？但是我這邊鬢上，不是也有了兩絲白髮麽？」芬若在左鬢上檢出兩縷銀絲，用力地一揪，都拔了下來，夾在指上。</p>

<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>「好漢獨怕病來魔」·原是人生最不幸的一件事·亦是無可抗力的一件事，不過近來要人，不能合作，或辦事棘手，不肯幹去，往往托病辭職，這亦是近來很時髦的一回事。</p>
<p>近日汪精衛先生之生病，其眞病耶，還是托病耶，汪精衛先生，爲革命元勳，在本年一月間，慨然出任行政院長，這時中日間的形勢，已非常嚴重，而先生不怕犧牲，毅然擔任，是汪先生數十年革命精神，未曾稍减，於此可見，乃汪先生於八月六日，突然從上海發表五個辭職通電，他給張學良氏電文中，有「引咎辭職以謝兄一人」等語，這個辭職，他人已認爲小題大做，有失行政院長的身分，厥後經諸要人的敦勸，總算馬馬虎虎進京了。</p>
<p>不料前日又潛然出京，托言醫病，留申不發，現當國難方殷，外交緊急之秋，迭經中央派員敦促，而汪仍遲遲我行，避不見客，亦無表示，此種態度，殊爲不解，汪先生是眞病耶，還是托病耶，倘果眞病，現當外交日急之秋，中央負責無人，也應力疾從公，臥而治之，方不媿爲愛黨愛國之偉人，若云托病，則更不知其所托者爲何事耶。</p>
<p>假定仍因張氏而辭職，則汪二次進京之時，張雖辭職其名、而未辭職其實，汪氏亦早己知之，假定非對張氏而辭職，則其所反對者爲何氏耶，若謂因外交急迫，應付爲難而辭職，更若富於革命精神的汪先生所宜出此，汪先生果眞病耶，抑托病耶。</p>

<h3>烟草的話</h3>
<p>— 孟復</p>
<p>烟草（ＬＯＢＡＣＣＯ）一物，從前本是北美的古巴土人所吸的一種烟，到現在世界上差不多已找不到没有牠的地方了·烟草用以製成香烟，携帶旣便利，吸法又簡便，所以吸牠的同志，也是益衆多，初吸時，以爲消消遣，但吸無妨，不知久吸而以至成癮以後，害處就很大了丨現在把這烟草來作一個科學上的解剖：</p>
<p>烟草在植物學上是屬於茄子科的，本來屬於茄子科的東西有毒的居多，就是日常大家所食用的茄子，多吃也要傷害喉嚨，所以凡是歌樂家都是不應該吃的，烟草主要的成分，大槪包含下列幾種·（一）尼古丁（ＮＩＣＯＴＩＮＥ）又名烟草精，（二）阿母尼亞（ＡＭＭＯＮＩＡ）·硫化輕（ＳＵＬＰＨurettedhydrogen）·（四）一酸化輕·（五）醋酸（acetricacid）·（六）酪酸·（七）其化各種炭水化合物·以上八種中，尤以尼古丁爲最重要，今試述尼古丁於下面：</p>
<p>所謂尼古丁者，爲一種無色之油狀液體，很容易溶於水中，并放出不快的臭氣，其沸騰點爲二四六·七度·尼古丁在烟葉中，是和枸椽及株檎酸等化合，成鹽狀而成在，至於其性質則非常之毒，祗要用五個米里克蘭姆（Milligram註：一米里克蘭姆等於一克蘭姆之千分之一）的純尼古丁，在二分鐘之間，便可以殺死一隻狗，據說從前有小孩，把大人久吸的烟咀作吹肥皂泡戲，不覺之間，吸入口中不少，後來不到三天，就中尼古丁的毒而死了，由此可見尼古丁毒了一斑了，</p>
<p>烟草中旣含有尼古丁這樣的毒物，所以多量使用以後，就會發生許多不良的現象，如面黄而少血色，時起輕微眩暈，夜間失眠，傷喉并且易致目疾，而尼古丁受害的程度，就種種動物試騐的結果、高等動物以腦受害爲最大，所以吸烟的人，亦以記憶力衰退爲最利害，未成年的人，發育尙未健全，吸烟的害處比成年人尤其來得大，</p>
<p>不過據近代幾位科學家研究的結果，烟草并非絶對無益的，牠對於虎列拉</p>

<p>那樣急激的傳染病菌，有消滅的功効，除此而外，對於赤痢的病菌，亦有同樣的功効，不過我想這些病儘有種種有効的藥物來預防和救治，假使要靠烟來除毒，那麽毒未除而反先受其害、我想這種方法，終不爲智者所取吧！</p>

<h3>再論早婚問題並答阿彦君</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>讀本日（十三）阿彦君的「我對於早婚的觀察」一文，態度文詞，兩俱佳勝，至爲敬佩！惟其理論，則未敢盡同，所以我認爲這問題還有討論的必要，所以我再來嚕囌幾句，是「吹毛求疵」，抑尙有若干道理在，則有待於賢明讀者的估評。爲便於明晰起見，得按阿君大文，分爲三截：（一）早婚果眞不成問題了麽？（二）早婚是没有害的麽？（三）手淫問題。</p>
<p>（一）鄙人前文所論早婚成因，辱承阿君嘉許，認爲與他的意思大致相同。然而阿君說：「不過因潮流的推移，這些解釋巳不能應用到晚近，家族組織雖還在掙扎着，但這些組織已裝爲新的洪流所冲毁，在廣大的農村社會裏，除了極少數的地主富農以外，大多數都在破産流離中的生活，自顧無暇，當然談不到早婚。」當然，中國的社會已不是原型的封建社會了，但是封建餘孽却還是十分濃厚的籠罩着中國社會，易詞而言：即是都市已有資本主義的畸形發展，而農村却只見破産，旣不封建，更未資本化，一般人雖在破産流離的生活中，呌苦連天，　因受封建遺毒過深，思想倫理習慣，大多依舊，還是要探探早婚的滋味，事實告訴我們，早婚在中國的社會裏，還是很普遍，所以也就還成問題，將來是將來，鄙人前文的論證，是指目前的社會，阿君又說：「都市中…受了摩登敎育，醉心…戀愛，父母的支配婚姻權。早已喪失，一豈知所謂摩登敎育，只是少數的資産階級子女所能享受，因此自由戀愛，也只有少數人能夠談到，多數的父母還握有婚姻支配權，成羣的没有受到摩登敎育的男女，還是在「父母之命，媒妁之言，一之下，盛行其舊式婚姻，早婚，而且此種廣大問題，豈可以少數的都市畸形現象來槪括？至於都市無産者，那確是没有早婚的可能，阿君說得很對！</p>
<p>（二）阿君不承認早婚害烈，尤難苟同，他說：「一般人以爲早婚在體質上是最大的損失，其實也不盡然，主要的要看當事人發育的程度如何而定，…早婚反可補救靑年的手淫問題（另論）…與其非法洩精，不如早婚。」照生理學講：男女到了十二歲，便有了性的需要，十四歲以後，漸趨成熟，需要更切，但正當發育與做人的基本工夫的時候，如任其早婚，理智敵不住情感，天然會沈醉於温柔鄉中，「哥哥」，「妹妹」，「擁抱」，「接吻」，「…」，豈不是會斵喪他她的身體與前程？鄙人有一位同學，就因這樣死了，妻子也因發育未全，小産棄世。至說：「…經濟不成問题，…早婚的發生……要取决於經濟環境，…有經濟生育之慮的人就没有早婚的可能·」事實却偏偏不然，鄉間許多人，雖然經濟困難，還是早婚，更有帶了小兒子小媳婦作苦工及行乞的事。就是經濟好的人，早婚是對的麽？未免失笑！</p>
<p>（三）手淫當然是靑年男女的最壞行爲，害處更甚於早婚，但也應設法改革，絶不可因此就以爲害亦烈的早婚來補救！最後阿君還說：「今後的兩性結合，儘可任其自然·」我且問：假如有十二三歲的男女，很想探探性的滋味，那也可以任其自然，讓他她試探或結合麽？阿君此語，未知曾否經過思考？</p>
<p>我的結論：在中國的現社會層裏，除少數人外，大多數還在因襲早婚，我仍認爲早婚有害，尤其對於身體，手淫是另一問題，需要另外解决，早婚還是應該改革，無疑地。</p>

<h3>The Fate of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>A Brief Commentary</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the September 18th Incident last year, when our government appealed to the League of Nations to severely sanction the violent Japanese actions, the world generally regarded this move as a major test of the League's capabilities. Now, a year has passed, and the situation of the Sino-Japanese problem has only intensified, while the League of Nations remains as it was. Does the League of Nations truly have the ability to act? No. Does it have no ability at all? No. Why? Because although the League of Nations is a collective of countries worldwide, its authority is entirely controlled by a few powerful nations. For disputes between small and weak countries, the League of Nations certainly has the ability to resolve them. If one of the disputing parties is a strong nation and the other is a weak nation, the League of Nations can still find ways to gloss over the matter. But when it comes to disputes between strong nations, the League of Nations will have no room to intervene.</p>
<p>More than ten years have passed since the League was established. Although the number of participating countries has reached fifty-four, due to the continuous refusal of the world's two major powers, the United States and Soviet Russia, to join, its weak capacity is self-evident. Fortunately, the five permanent administrative committee members – Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan – are still able to maintain considerable communication. Therefore, the League of Nations has still achieved considerable success in resolving disputes among smaller countries. Examples include the Iceland issue between Sweden and Finland, the Vilnius problem between Poland and Lithuania, the Corfu incident involving Italy and Greece, and the Mosul problem involving Britain and Turkey – all of these are well-known cases.</p>
<p>When the Sino-Japanese incident occurred last year, the League of Nations was indeed under significant threat, trapped in a difficult position. This was because, to uphold justice, it was indeed necessary to sanction Japan. However, Japan is a powerful nation, so how could it be sanctioned? Fortunately, our country prioritized peace and was unwilling to lightly initiate a war. The League of Nations was thus able to resort to its evasive tactics, deciding to dispatch an investigation team. And so, to this day, the League of Nations remains as it was.</p>
<p>However, the recent League of Nations is truly facing a serious test. The first issue under scrutiny will be the Franco-German arms negotiations. Since Germany submitted a memorandum to the Disarmament Conference on July 20th, and sent a note to the French Ambassador to Germany,  François-Poncet, on August 31st, requesting a reorganization of the German army to gradually achieve equality with France, this matter has become the most significant issue in Europe today. Germany's demand for arms equality has gained support from various countries, which recognize it as a reasonable request. However, France and its ally Poland are vehemently opposed, considering it a violation of the Treaty of Versailles. The two sides' opinions are extremely difficult to reconcile. Germany has now sent a letter to the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, stating that if the demand for disarmament equality cannot be met, Germany will be unable to participate in the League of Nations Administrative Committee meeting scheduled for September 21st. If Germany does not participate in the League of Nations Administrative Committee meeting, the League of Nations will inevitably suffer a major blow.</p>
<p>What's more, Italy is providing great assistance to Germany's arms request. According to a dispatch from the "National Society" on the 17th, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has declared that if Italy's proposals cannot be presented for discussion at this session, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations. This is another blow to the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The second serious test facing the League of Nations is the situation caused by Japan's recognition of the puppet state. Although the public opinion in various countries largely disapproves of Japan's actions in recognizing the puppet state, the authorities in these countries are temporarily remaining silent, awaiting the release of the League of Nations investigation team report next month and the League's response. However, the Tokyo government seems to have decided that if the League of Nations denies Japan's claims, it will not hesitate to withdraw from the League. If Germany, Italy, and Japan all withdraw from the League, can the League of Nations still maintain its life?</p>
<p>France, Germany, and Italy are all considered powerful nations by the world. When disputes arise among powerful nations, it becomes a difficult problem for the League of Nations. The conflict between Japan and China is also a struggle between power and justice. Will the international organization for maintaining world peace suppress justice to follow power, or will it suppress power to uphold justice? This is also a difficult problem for the League of Nations. The upcoming League of Nations General Assembly will face a severe test on these two issues and will determine its fate.</p>

<p>I</p>

Division Commander Cao led the Rong and Li brigades, also arriving in Yedo from Pingdu to converge and continue searching forward (19th Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Jinan) The five departments of civil affairs, finance, construction, education, and industry will jointly issue a statement, announcing that Liu Zhennian has disrupted the provincial administrative system in more than a dozen counties in eastern Shandong. Key policies in civil affairs, finance, construction, education, and industry have been obstructed and cannot be implemented (19th Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Jinan) At noon on the 19th, Liu's troops had retreated more than a hundred li east of Changi. The car roads along the way were severely damaged, and all the bridges were burned, resulting in great losses. Han Fuqu is still in Changi supervising the army, repairing bridges and advancing (19th Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Zhennian's public telegram arrived in Ping, inquiring about Han's intention to advance into Jiaodong, stating that he had ordered the front troops to withdraw (19th Dispatch).</p>
<p>Weixian: Han Fuqu's army, with the Second Division of Gu Liangmin's troops, the 29th Division of Cao Fulin's troops, and the 74th Division of Qiao Lizhi's troops as its three mixed main forces, is advancing eastward from Weixian. Their vanguard troops have arrived at Xinhe. The troops advancing from Gaomi have passed Pingdu and are stationed in Jiaoshui. A detachment advancing north from Jiaozhou has reached the line of Liujiazhuang, Xirenzhao. Han Fuqu himself arrived in Changi from Weixian at 3:00 PM on the 17th and immediately issued a general attack order for the entire front line. The battle line extends 84 miles. Han's army is using the militia as its vanguard and has switched to the offensive, beginning the general attack. Liu Zhennian only learned of Han's attack this morning, and due to the unexpectedness of the situation, he was flustered and rushed to transport troops to the front lines by car and freight train from Zhifu and Longkou. The situation on the battlefield is gradually becoming unfavorable for Liu's army. However, Liu Zhennian himself claimed that he still had remaining soldiers and vowed to fight to the end. According to observations from Weixian, Han's army has a good chance of winning, so they are optimistic. The market is relatively calm (18th Reuters Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Yantai) According to sources, Han Fuqu's troops have invaded Liu's defense zone, causing disturbances at the end of the week. The purpose of Han's troops' invasion is to gain control of eastern Shandong, as eastern Shandong is the wealthiest region in Shandong. Liu Zhennian, in his capacity as the commander of the 20th Division, has been stationed there for four years. Han's troops are currently in Weixian, and it is rumored that Han himself is also there. His troops are slightly distant from the car road. Liu's troops are currently gathered in Laizhou. All troops near Yantai have now been dispatched. Reports of Liu's troops' retreat are currently being denied by Liu's side, and there are reports that Liu will continue to resist Han. Liu's chief of staff has gone to appeal to Chiang Kai-shek, hoping that Han's troops will not advance further and that Yantai will not become a battlefield. If Liu's troops do need to retreat, they may take the road through Fushan and retreat towards Laiyang. Martial law has been declared here. The car road is currently still peaceful, but due to the frequent movement of troops, it is currently impassable (19th Reuters Dispatch).</p>
<h3>Han's Army Uses Jiaoxian as Base of Operations</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Han's army is advancing in the Pingdu and Jiaozhou area and is using Jiaozhou as its base of operations.

However, it is heard that Han Fuqu has 120,000 troops and plans to resolve Liu's 30,000 troops within a month.

<h3>Han Fuqu's Reply Telegram to Ma Hongkui</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui sent two telegrams to Han Fuqu for mediation.

He has already submitted the details to the Central Government and will listen to the orders of the Central Government and Chiang. After receiving the telegram, Ma informed Liu's representative Zhang Guangsan to relay the message to Liu (19th Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Hongkui telegraphed Han Fuqu yesterday to mediate the war in eastern Shandong, but has not received a reply. Jiang Bocheng previously telegraphed Chairman Chiang to report this matter. Chiang sent a telegram to Ping today, preventing Han and Liu from warring against each other (19th Dispatch).</p>
<h3>The Central Government Advocates Strict Prohibition</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the morning of the 19th, during the Standing Committee meeting, He Yingqin reported on the news of the Han-Liu conflict received by the Ministry of Military Affairs, as well as the situation of sending telegrams to stop it. It was unanimously agreed that with the national crisis being so urgent, internal strife should not be allowed to recur. It was decided to immediately telegraph Chiang to strictly prohibit any military action by both sides. According to sources here, the Jiaodong area has always been coveted by the Japanese, such as the operation of Fangzi Jinling Town mines, the gathering of overseas merchants, and economic forces have long been spread throughout the area. If the region engages in internal conflict, the Japanese can use the opportunity to send troops into our hinterland on the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese and merchants, doing whatever they want. It is also heard that the Japanese have already prepared this plan after this incident (19th Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the conflict between Han Fuqu and Liu Zhennian's troops, He Yingqin telegraphed both sides on the 18th, strongly prohibiting it, saying that at this time of severe national crisis, internal rifts must not occur again, so as to please the enemy and grieve those who are close. Liu has already replied, ordering his troops to retreat backwards. Han's reply has not yet arrived. According to He Yingqin's statement to the press, this matter can be properly resolved soon and will not escalate (19th Dispatch).</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang Separately Telegraphed Han and Liu for Mediation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang hopes that the Shandong war will not escalate and has separately telegraphed Han and Liu to find ways to mediate (19th Dispatch).</p>
<p>(Beiping) All parties in Ping believe that they do not want the Shandong war to escalate during the national crisis and have decided to do their best to mediate between the two sides. Zhang Xueliang has telegraphed Shen Honglie to enlighten Liu nearby. Chiang has separately telegraphed Han and Liu to suspend military action and await the Central Government's orders for resolution. Liu's troops plan to be transferred away from Shandong, first going to Haizhou or Henan and Anhui to participate in bandit suppression. Liu telegraphed Ma Hongkui, with the general meaning that he would listen to the Central Government's orders and obey Han's intentions, and for the sake of the overall situation, he has ordered the front-line troops to withdraw and will not resist (19th Dispatch).</p>
<h3>Han's Expression After Reading Liu's Telegram</h3>
<p>(Jinan) Liu Zhennian sent a telegram to Han Fuqu yesterday. After reading it, Han expressed that he always acted with the people as his starting point, and shifted with the people's interests as the focus. Liu has been in charge of Jiaodong for five years, levying exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, making the people miserable. The people of eastern Shandong had long accused him to me. I went to Ping twice, and the Ping-Lu Fellow Association repeatedly requested that I punish Liu early to relieve the people from their suffering. I even explained on his behalf and did not forward it to the Central Government. I can be said to be lenient to Liu. Previously, Liu asked the provincial government for military funding. The military headquarters approved a monthly payment of 30,000 yuan. Liu initially demanded 300,000 yuan, then changed it to 150,000 yuan. The provincial party committee Zhang Dongcun interceded and requested 120,000 yuan per month. He replied that it was acceptable if it was 1,800 yuan less, but 120,000 yuan was absolutely impossible. Such unreasonable perfunctory behavior is truly unbearable. In addition to arbitrary exploitation, Liu also colluded with local bandits in Jiaodong. The two bandits captured in Jiaozhou previously all had commissions from Liu, admitting that Liu planned to attack Weixian around the Double Tenth Festival. My move is to follow public opinion, relieve the people's suffering, and maintain local order. This morning, I received telegrams from Chiang and He asking about the situation, and I have replied separately to explain. The Central Government will send Yin Wufu and Zhao Bingheng here to investigate the truth of Liu's troop movements. Liu's troops are now very shaken, and many militia stationed in various counties are thinking of rebelling (19th Dispatch).</p>
<h3>Liu Zhennian's Representative in Ping Speaks</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Zhennian's representative, Guangsan, said that he came to Ping as a representative of Commander Liu to commemorate Ma Fuxiang. He left Yan on the 13th and arrived in Ping on the 15th.

Yesterday, he received another telegram from Liu, saying that Han's army's attack on us has been confirmed. It can be seen that Liu had no provocative actions beforehand. At the same time, Liu telegraphed Ma Hongkui, requesting mediation, with sincere language. Liu will issue a public telegram within a day or two, stating the history of his troops stationed in Shandong, as well as the suddenness of the incident, and is willing to listen to the Central Government and Shandong authorities' intentions to seek a resolution (19th Dispatch).</p>

<p>Ma Qingyuan's Troops to Be Resolved Soon</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wei Zhenhua, an official of the Shaanxi Provincial Government stationed in Nanjing, came to Nanjing from Long County on the 17th. He said that he originally planned to return to Nanjing immediately after completing his official business, but because Ma Qingyuan privately killed the brigade commander and used force to coerce the army, he was insane and used the wrong people. Yang Hucheng repeatedly telegraphed to persuade him, but he could not be moved by his stubbornness. Therefore, he personally went to Long County. Now, the 17th Division Yang Xueheng's troops have been stationed in Tianshui on the 11th. Ma Qingyuan only led the remnants of more than 700 people and abandoned the city to flee southwest. Yang's troops stationed in Chengzhou and other counties believe that Ma Qingyuan is surrounded by villains and has taken a dead end. They are prepared to take decisive action. Now, his troops are returning east one after another. Even the two direct subordinate engineering and transportation battalions he led have been about to return. The remaining hundreds of people will definitely not survive. Ma Qingyuan may self-destruct. (Special dispatch from the 19th)</p>

Please attach a list of all the items sent to prevent loss en route. Do not send banknotes. As for Mr. Kirkland of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, he is not included in these conditions. If the Asiatic company does not want to negotiate, then he will suffer. If you do not come to negotiate next week, we will cut off his ear and send it to you." Dr. Phillip has replied by letter, asking the bandits to send a responsible representative to Niuzhuang to negotiate with him. (Reuters dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Puppet Organization Sends a Consul to Russia</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The first foreign envoy of "Manchukuo," Consul Jitsun, stationed in Boli, along with his vice consul and a group of nine people, arrived in Shenyang yesterday from Changchun due to the unrest on the China Eastern Railway. They departed Shenyang at 3:00 PM to take up their posts in Boli via Hancheng, Qingjin, and Vladivostok. Consul Jitsun told reporters when passing through Shenyang that the Russian side, when issuing passports for him and his party to pass through Vladivostok, specifically noted them as "Manchukuo" consul and "Manchukuo officials." This serves as evidence of the Soviet Union's de facto recognition of Manchukuo. He added that they will arrive in Boli on the 26th and hold the inaugural ceremony of the first consulate of Manchukuo on Soviet territory. (Dentsu dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams</p>
<p>Japanese Military Headquarters to Further Increase Troops in the Northeast</p>
<p>Okamura Returns Home to Report on Military Situation</p>
<p>Will Carry Important Instructions to Shenyang</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th: The Ministry of the Army announced that the Emperor has approved the replacement of a portion of the Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria. This morning, Prince Kan'in, Chief of the Army General Staff, met with the Emperor. It is reported that they discussed the military arrangements between Japan and the "Manchukuo puppet state." According to news reports, the 14th Division, which went to Manchuria after participating in the Shanghai war, has begun to withdraw to Japan. The details of which army will replace it and its troop numbers are currently unknown. It is generally believed that this change will increase the number of Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 19th: According to reliable sources, the replacement of Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria includes not only infantry but also cavalry.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: Japanese Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff Okamura arrived in Beijing this morning with the Japan-Manchukuo treaty agreement and instructed Secretary Tahara to deliver it to Matsuda, Director of the Treaty Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Major General Okamura then visited Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in at the General Staff Headquarters to report on the military situation.

It is reported that concrete instructions will be available to take back within two or three days.</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway President Insecure in His Position</p>
<p>Vice President Hatta Disobeys Orders and Refuses to Return to Beijing</p>
<p>Japanese Political Situation in Turmoil, May Be Due to This</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 19th: South Manchuria Railway President Hayashi is in conflict with the military and South Manchuria Railway employees and is currently confined to his private residence, refusing all meetings. The Ministry of Colonial Affairs is also deeply concerned. As a result, President Hayashi may resign voluntarily.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: According to the Toho newspaper, the main reasons why the Japanese military, South Manchuria Railway employees, and Japanese residents in the three eastern provinces are rejecting President Hayashi are: (1) When Earl Hayashi arrived, he brought a large number of family members and attendants, resembling the entourage of a daimyo in the Tokugawa era, wasting excessive amounts of money and disregarding the soldiers toiling in the battlefield. (2) He specializes in collecting plants, like a botany professor visiting the three eastern provinces, and is not very concerned about the affairs of the South Manchuria Railway. At this most critical time, such a president has no choice but to retire. (3) President Hayashi has been exaggerating his many years of experience as chairman of the budget committee in the Upper House and is proficient in Manchurian and Mongolian affairs, but in reality, he is just a silver spearhead with a wax shaft and is not applicable at all.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: President Hayashi of the South Manchuria Railway in Tokyo recently telegraphed Vice President Hatta to return to Beijing, but Hatta replied that the situation in Manchuria was serious and he could not obey the order, refusing to return to Beijing. Hatta is an Upper House member of the Seiyukai party. When he first took office as vice president, he was strongly rejected by the military. South Manchuria Railway employees also opposed him. Now, he is cooperating with South Manchuria Railway employees, Japanese residents groups in Manchuria, and the Japanese military to drive out President Hayashi. Their purpose is to force the Saito cabinet to resign. The Hayashi problem has become an important issue in the Japanese political world. Saito and Nagai must bear full responsibility. Earl Hayashi's resignation will mean the downfall of the Saito cabinet will not be far off.</p>
<p>Planning to Build a Sea Railway Bridge</p>
<p>Preparing for Military Action Against Russia</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: Urged by the Japanese military, the Civil Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Railway Department authorities have decided to start the construction of the sea railway bridge between Shimonoseki and Moji as soon as possible. This year, 30,000 yuan will be used to start the survey and design, and next year, 200,000 yuan will be used for drawing. It is reported that the military is urging this very urgently because of military needs against Russia. However, since the total cost is expected to be over 25 million yuan, it may be difficult to start construction next year given Japan's current financial situation.</p>
<p>Japan's Finances Are Exhausted</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 19th: In order to raise 1.943 billion yuan in expenditure for this year's budget, it is necessary to issue more than 600 million yuan in public bonds. The authorities have exhausted their wisdom and ability. After this year, there is a trend of new demands being put forward for next year's budget due to the Manchurian Incident and the rescue of the current situation. However, if all of these revenue shortfalls are sought from public bonds, the amount of new public bonds issued next year will reach 800 to 900 million yuan. Japan currently has 6 billion yuan in public bonds. If this continues, there is a risk of breaking 10 billion yuan within two or three years. If Japan's finances, with only 1.3 billion yuan in regular revenue, issue 10 billion yuan in public bonds, a major incident may be triggered. Therefore, the administrative authorities of the Ministry of Finance are quite worried about this trend. When compiling next year's budget, they plan to establish two major principles: (1) Except for what is absolutely necessary, no new demands will be recognized, even in extraordinary times, and all other aspects will adopt a tight fiscal policy. (2) In order to increase revenue, in addition to reconsidering the current tax system, new sources of revenue will be sought, such as increasing taxes or creating new taxes. However, Finance Minister Takahashi believes that this is not the time to increase taxes and opposes new taxes and tax increases, deciding to use all deficit public bonds to cover the revenue shortfall. Therefore, it is highly doubtful to what extent the administrative authorities' efforts can be realized.</p>
<p>Key Suspect in the May 15th Incident Arrested</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 19th: The owner of the Zishanzhuku academy (age 41) at the foot of Mount Tsukuba in Ibaraki Prefecture, ○○, is a mastermind behind the May 15th Incident. The authorities have been urgently searching for him. After the incident, he secretly went to Manchuria with a certain owner of the Aikyo academy. Recently, he secretly returned to Japan and sneaked into Tokyo, cohabitating with a waitress at a coffee shop in Shibuya, outside Tokyo. The authorities discovered this and arrested him last night at 11:00 PM by the Special Higher Police Department of the Metropolitan Police Department. This person graduated from Waseda University and served as an advisor to Zhang Zuolin with the qualification of secretary to Mitsuru Toyama, a master of the Eastern-style heroic society. In Showa 3 (1928), he established the Zishanzhuku academy at the foot of Mount Tsukuba to educate young people. He provided money to Gorō Hishinuma of the assassination group Takuma and was responsible for guiding students in the peasant suicide squad incident.</p>
<p>Nihon Rengo News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: As a result of the arrest of the head of the Zishanzhuku academy, a mastermind behind the May 15th Incident, a second major incident planned by them will not occur, and the authorities are relieved. It is said that the head of the Zishanzhuku academy provided pistols several times in April of this year to naval officers involved in the May 15th Incident who lacked pistols. At the same time, he secretly supported the peasant suicide squad. After the incident occurred, he fled to Manchuria and soon returned to Japan, obtaining several pistols in Tsuchiura and deciding to carry out a second major incident with students from the Zishanzhuku academy. However, the authorities discovered the plan and he was arrested.</p>
<p>The Issue of Equality in Armaments</p>
<p>Britain Issues a Statement</p>
<p>Economic Difficulties Encountered</p>
<p>Believes Germany's Sudden Demand for Armaments is Unwise</p>
<p>In Accordance with France</p>
<p>Opposes Disregarding Obligations of the Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>Italy and Russia Sympathetic to Germany</p>
<p>May Propose Postponing the Disarmament Conference</p>
<p>London, 18th: The British government today issued a long-awaited statement explaining its attitude towards Germany's demand for equality in armaments. This is an important development in the international situation. The statement said that in view of Germany's economic difficulties, it is unwise for Germany to launch a fierce dispute in the political arena, and that in view of the creditors' concessions to Germany, Germany's action is even more inappropriate. Although the issue of equality in armaments will always arise before the close of the Disarmament Conference, it is greatly unfavorable to propose it hastily at this stage. Like France, Britain will not allow any action that disregards treaty obligations, and does not accept the view that the Disarmament Conference can cancel Chapter 5 of the Treaty. Britain has greatly reduced its various armaments since the signing of the Treaty and is still cooperating with Geneva to achieve greater equality in armaments among countries. The purpose of Geneva is to actively reduce the armaments of countries with more arms, while not increasing the armaments of countries with fewer arms. Would it not be self-contradictory if the result of the first Disarmament Conference were to be the expansion of armaments and the re-armament of any country? For the sake of calming the minds of the general public, the issue of armament status, which involves the concept of national honor, should be resolved through friendly negotiations, rather than through arbitrary challenges or refusing to attend and deliberate. It remains to be seen whether the peace structure broken by Germany's armament demands can be compensated for by the aforementioned British statement. It still depends on Germany's final decision. Italy and Russia support Germany's demands, but Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently advised Germany in newspaper articles to make moderate requests when the Disarmament Conference has practically completed its work. France maintains an uncompromising attitude and has stated that France can present surprising documents to prove that Germany is privately expanding its armaments. French Prime Minister Herriot stated that Germany's demands are also related to small countries, and that he cannot agree if anyone advocates submitting Germany's demands to a conference limited to major powers. The US State Department hopes that Germany will reconsider its withdrawal from the conference. The United States is now determined to propose disarmament measures. The main members of the Disarmament Conference are scheduled to meet on Wednesday. There are differing opinions in Geneva on whether it can continue to meet in the absence of the German representative. It is generally believed that Italy and Russia will suggest postponing the conference to wait for a resolution with Germany.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th: France and the United States are now both enthusiastically supporting Britain's statement on armaments. Major countries, in view of the slow progress of the initial Disarmament Conference due to the impact of the Far East situation, are now expressing their determination not to take any more delaying actions. The French newspapers especially welcome the British statement, praising the firmness of its tone and calling the recent clarification of the equal steps taken by Britain and France. The opinion of the American political circles is very sympathetic to the statement's arguments. According to American newspapers, the statement was drafted after consultation with the United States. The United States now hopes that it can clear up all obstacles and move forward in accordance with President Hoover's policy of reducing armaments by one-third.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 18th: On Sunday morning, the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Horace Rumbold, delivered the British government's note in response to Germany's armament demands to German Foreign Minister von Neurath. The full text of the note has not yet been released, and German newspapers only obtained its gist from last night's London telegram. On the German government side, this note has created a rather desperate impression, as the British government's negative attitude was not anticipated by the German cabinet. In recent days, German newspapers have been telling readers that Britain would surely express sympathy for Germany's demands, but the British attitude indicated by the British will is not the case. Therefore, it may put the German government in a dilemma. However, nationalist newspapers have already loudly called for attacking the "unfriendly wording" of the British note and asking the government to reject the practical measures proposed by Britain. The "Montag Report," the only newspaper that supports the Papen cabinet, said, "Since Herriot's declaration in the French House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, this British note has indeed shown us that Germany's enemies are not at home, but abroad. The newspaper is dissatisfied with the British note, saying that it has the tone of a "headmaster" instructing students, and that the note even wants to force Germany to continue to disarm, while Britain itself does not fulfill its solemn obligations under the League of Nations Covenant." The newspaper also said that British public opinion differs from the government's opinion on this matter, and ended by saying that the mediation measures proposed in the British note are unacceptable, because Germany will not participate in any new negotiations until the right to equality in armaments is fully recognized.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Resolves to Use Force Against Liu Zhennian</h3>
<p>Han Troops Divided into Two Routes, Approaching from Jiaoji and Yanwei</p>
<p>Liu's Troops Retreating in Changyi, No Contact at the Front</p>
<p>A dispatch from Weixian reports that Provincial Chairman and Third Route Commander-in-Chief Han Fuqu is going to Jiaodong to supervise the campaign and resolve the Liu Zhennian issue. Today, Han has issued a telegram denouncing Liu, and the situation at the front is tense, with an imminent outbreak of conflict. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Origin of the Incident: Liu's forces have been stationed in over ten counties in Jiaodong, and have historically raised funds locally, with high demands. Since the beginning of this year, they have also withheld regular and miscellaneous taxes from the defense area, amounting to over 200,000 yuan per month, severely impacting the provincial government's finances. When Han Fuqu went to Beiping a month ago, Ke Fengsun and others from the Shandong Fellow Association in Beiping complained to Han, saying that Han was sitting idly by while the people of over ten counties in Jiaodong were suffering, and was being irresponsible. Han was moved by this. After returning to Jinan, urgent telegrams from the Jiaodong militia regarding conflicts with Liu's forces arrived like snowflakes, stating that if the government could suppress Liu Zhennian, the people were willing to be the vanguard. Han, seeing that the militia also had this request, decided to use heavy forces to pressure Liu.</p>
<p>Troop Deployment: After Han's plan to suppress Liu was finalized, he summoned Cao Fulin, the commander of the 29th Division stationed in Zhoucun, Li Baode, the commander of the cavalry brigade stationed in Qingzhou, Zhao Mingyuan, the commander of the Ludong militia, Li Hanzhang, the commander of the 85th Brigade of the 29th Division stationed in Dezhou, and Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 20th Division in Jinan, Qiao Lizhi, the commander of the 74th Division, Chen Dexin, the commander of the 86th Brigade of the 29th Division, Gu Liangmin, the commander of the 21st Division, and Ning Chunxiao, the commander of the 64th Brigade of that division, Li Zhanbiao, the commander of the 66th Brigade, and Lei Taiping, the commander of the pistol brigade, to a meeting in Jinan to discuss military plans. It was generally decided to advance in two routes. Cao Fulin's 87th Brigade led by Rong Guangxing and Li Hanzhang's brigade stationed in Dezhou, and Chen Dexin's brigade stationed in Jinan would take the Jiaoji railway line, with Cao Fulin commanding in Weixian. The 74th Division's Ma Guanyi brigade stationed in Weixian and the 11th Division's Li Zhanbiao brigade and a certain brigade stationed in Jinan would take the Yanwei automobile route, advancing from Changyi to Yexian, with Han personally commanding and Weixian as the rear. Another brigade was to be sent to Wei as a general reserve. Li Baode's cavalry brigade was responsible for searching both routes, and four armored trains would patrol between Weixian and Jiaozhou. The defense of southern Shandong would be the responsibility of Sun Tongxuan's two brigades of the 20th Division. Sun would be stationed in Yanzhou. The defense of the area near the river would still be the responsibility of Zhan Shutang's 80th Division. The defense of northern and western Shandong would be the responsibility of Qiao Lizhi's two brigades of the 74th Division. Qiao would be stationed in Dezhou. Jinan would be the responsibility of Gu Liangmin's two brigades of the division. Once the plan was set, the armies began to mobilize, with ten trains being prepared on both the Jinpu and Jiaoji railways to actively transport troops. After Li Baode's cavalry brigade stationed in Qingzhou left, a part of Lei Taiping's pistol brigade was sent to fill the defense. For a time, military trains were constantly running on the Jiaoji railway line, and passenger and freight trains were often delayed. Han appointed Zhang Lianjia, the director of the river affairs bureau, to command the vehicles, as he had experience. He was specially transferred to serve at the front. (Zhang was ordered to go east this morning.) Furthermore, the rear deployment was important, and Jinan, as the capital of the province, should be carefully secured. On the evening of the 15th, he specially convened a meeting with Li Shuchun, the director of civil affairs, Zhang Shaotang, the secretary-general of the provincial government, and Liu Shuxiang, the chief of staff of the general headquarters, to decide that Li would be responsible for the affairs of the general headquarters, and Li and Zhang would be jointly responsible for the affairs of the provincial government. The security of Jinan would be the responsibility of the garrison commander Lei Taiping and the chief of public security Wang Kairu, who would supervise the military and police to maintain order. Once the plan was set, Han set off from Jinan at 5:20 a.m. on the 16th, with Chief of Staff Liu Shuxiang accompanying him. Because Sun boarded the train at Wangsherenzhuang, 30 li from Jinan, few people outside knew about it. The newspapers in the provincial capital were also ordered not to publish it for the time being.</p>
<p>Situation at the Front: Han Fuqu arrived in Weixian at 2 p.m. on the 16th, and the headquarters was set up in Weixian City (in the Chamber of Commerce building). He strictly ordered the armies to advance day and night. By the 17th, all the armies had reached their destinations. Li Zhanbiao and Ma Guanyi's two brigades advanced from Changyi and headed for Shahe. Rong Guangxing and Li Hanzhang's two brigades advanced from Jiaozhou and headed for Pingdu. Han Fuqu went to Changyi from Weixian at 3 p.m. on the 16th to inspect the deployment at the front. This morning, a long-distance telephone call from Changyi said that the chairman had left Weixian by car in the afternoon yesterday and arrived in Changyi at 5:30 p.m., stationed in the county government. He stopped briefly in Hanting and had a picnic on the ground. The wooden bridge in Shahe Town, 50 li east of Changyi, was burned down by Liu's army when they retreated, and the automobile road was destroyed. Now our cavalry brigade has crossed the river and advanced eastward. Pingdu is still under Liu's army. Commander Cao led Rong Guangxing and Li Hanzhang's two brigades to advance towards Pingdu from Gaomi and Jiaozhou in different routes. Our plane went to Laiyang last night for reconnaissance and heard that Liu Zhennian's troops had buried many landmines in the Shahe and Pingdu areas. Yexian is garrisoned by Liu's First Brigade, two regiments (1st and 3rd), and the artillery regiment and engineering battalion. The Second Regiment of that brigade is stationed in Qixia. The Eighth Regiment of Liu's forces is stationed in Shahe. The Yanwei automobile road has been destroyed by Liu's forces, and many automobiles have been seized.</p>
<p>Brief History of Liu Zhennian: Liu Zhennian, styled Ru Xi, is from Nangong, Hebei. He was a student at the Baoding Military Academy. In the 16th year, when Zhang Zongchang was governor of Shandong, Fang Yongchang was stationed in Yizhou, and Liu served as a regimental commander under Fang. When Fang's forces were reorganized into the Fourth Army, Liu was promoted to brigade commander. In the 17th year, Zhang Zongchang failed and fled Jinan in a panic at night. The Northern Expeditionary Army took advantage of this, and the Japanese army suddenly provoked the Jinan Incident. Fang Yongchang led his troops to flee from eastern Yi, and Liu replaced Fang as commander of his forces. He also merged with He Yisan's Third Division, and his numbers gradually increased. He began to stand out, stationed in the Dengzhou area of eastern Shandong. He was then appointed by the central government as the commander of the 21st Division. In the 18th year, Zhang Zongchang and Chu Yupu disturbed Jiaodong. Liu fought to the death against them. The victory at Muping captured and killed Chu, and his reputation greatly increased. The central government praised his achievements and ordered him to change the name to the 17th Army, appointing Liu as the army commander and a member of the provincial government. In the winter of the 19th year, the army designation was abolished, and it was still called the 21st Division. His troops were stationed in Penglai, Zhaoyuan, Huangxian, Yexian, Muping, Pingdu, Laiyang, Fushan, Qixia, Rongcheng, Wendeng, and other counties. In the 20th year, Han Fuqu became the chairman of Shandong, and Liu remained a member of the provincial government. In recent years, Liu's forces have been actively expanding and training day and night. This year, they have also purchased many military horses in Zhangjiakou. Although nominally a division, in reality its strength is more than double that of a division. It has the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd brigades, as well as an independent brigade, an artillery regiment, a special service regiment, an education regiment, and special service battalions. (Evening of the 17th)</p>
<p>A dispatch from Qingdao reports that since Liu Zhennian's troops have been stationed in Yantai and various counties in Jiaodong, there have been many complaints from the people due to local fund-raising. Recently, Liu has again increased excessive taxes in the counties where he is stationed, under the guise of raising military funds, amounting to about 400,000 yuan, causing widespread resentment among the people, who have risen up in resistance. The Jiaodong militia is also secretly helping the people, trying to resist. Therefore, Liu's army and the militia have been at odds. On the morning of the 15th, Liu's troops stationed in Shahe in Pingdu and Laiyang clashed with the militia. The militia was outnumbered and was defeated by Liu's army. Zhao Mingyuan, the commander of the Jiaodong militia, immediately telegraphed Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu for help. Initially, Han was dissatisfied with Liu's army arbitrarily increasing taxes in the defense area, but he did not want to cause disputes due to the current national crisis, so they were able to live in peace. Recently, he heard that Liu's army was actively recruiting soldiers and purchasing weapons in the counties where they were stationed, and this time, they clashed with the militia due to the increase in excessive taxes, which made him even more unhappy. Therefore, after hearing the report, he decided to thoroughly suppress them, ordered mobilization, and ordered Cao Fulin's 29th Division to set out east and concentrate in Weixian, awaiting orders to attack. The headquarters of the 29th Division is located in Weixian City. The Beiping armored train also arrived in Wei yesterday. At the same time, large numbers of troops continued to arrive in Fangzi, Zuoshan, Gaomi, Jiaoxian, and other places. Liu Yurong, the commander of the 170th Regiment of the 85th Brigade stationed in Qingzhou, led his regiment to Gaomi on the 16th to take charge of security matters. A machine gun battalion also arrived in Jiaoxian on the 16th. Rong Guangxing's 87th Brigade stationed in Jiaoxian was ordered to advance towards Pingdu, taking a pincer formation. It is reported that Han himself secretly took a special train on the Jiaoji Railway to Wei at 5:00 a.m. on the 16th, convened Cao Fulin, Zhan Shutang, Zhao Mingyuan, and others, and held an emergency military meeting, and gave instructions in person. After the meeting, he set off to inspect the front. As for Liu Zhennian's troops, they are also actively preparing for war, but they are purely defensive due to being outnumbered. They have built three lines of defense. The first line is in Shahe, Pingdu, the second line is in Yexian, Laiyang, and the third line is near Longkou, Huangxian, and Qixia, and they have built artillery fortresses. The project is extremely strong. Moreover, a part of the 85th Brigade stationed in Wei, about 1,000 men, was ordered to move to Changyi this morning. The two armies are very close to each other, and the situation is tense, and a war is about to break out. Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie is deeply concerned about the tense situation in Jiaodong, fearing that it will affect Qingdao's security. This morning, he specially convened important personnel at the city government to discuss maintenance measures and decided that in order to prevent defeated soldiers from fleeing into the city, he would send more than 200 marines, carrying four mortars, to Jimo to take precautions. At the same time, he ordered the Public Security Bureau's Security Brigade to closely contact the navy and strengthen security in the city. At night, the Public Security Bureau formed an armed patrol team to guard all important roads to prevent accidents. Xie Guozhe, the chief of staff of the naval headquarters, was ordered by Shen this afternoon to go to Weixian to meet Cao Fulin to discuss military and defense matters. According to Shen, he had no prior knowledge of the conflict between Han and Liu. However, at a time when the country is in great difficulty, it is not worth it to have another civil war, regardless of who is right or wrong. It is his duty to be seriously vigilant and maintain the security of the city, and he will never allow defeated soldiers to flee into the city. As for the fleet and marines stationed in Weihai, etc., he has ordered them to strictly guard their defenses and protect the ground, and they should not be affected. (September 17th)</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of the September 18th National Crisis</h3>
<p>Ma Zhanshan's Heartfelt Appeal to the People (Continued)</p>
<p>As for the beginning and end of the Japanese manufacturing of the puppet state, the details are also in the telegram to the League of Nations Investigation Team, which reads:</p>
<p>(Above omitted) Since the Manchurian people and our Han people have been mixed for three hundred years, living in Manchuria, and have been safe and sound. The politics, culture, customs, language, and religion are all the same. Therefore, the political revolution of 1910, although it overthrew the Qing government and changed the system to a republic, there was not the slightest expression of hatred between the Han and Manchu people. Moreover, the distinction between the terms "Manchu" and "Han" people disappeared invisibly. This is commonly known by the world who understands the Chinese situation, and it is not Zhanshan's personal opinion. Therefore, the so-called Manchu people and Manchuria have become historical terms, and there is no value in using them today. However, the Japanese must take this as a rare commodity, secretly use this old term in the dictionary to split our nation and divide our land. It is unimaginable that in the civilized world of the twentieth century, there are still acts of despising international justice and being inhuman. This is a fuse for destroying peace in East Asia. Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that members of the League of Nations are responsible for respecting and maintaining the territorial integrity of all members of the League of Nations. Also, the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922 guarantees the territorial and administrative integrity of China, and the open door and equal opportunities in the three eastern provinces. These are all inconvenient for Japan's attempt to annex the three eastern provinces. They borrowed the name of national self-determination, used bandit methods, kidnapped the abdicated Emperor Puyi, and forced him from Tianjin to Lushun. They also coerced and lured the original officials of the three eastern provinces to stage a farce. Puyi tried to commit suicide with medicine several times on the way, but he was discovered and stopped by the Japanese who were monitoring him, and he could not seek death. His situation was also miserable. Zhanshan was ordered by the National Government to serve as the chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government and the deputy commander of the Northeast Border Defense Army stationed in Jiang. Zhanshan is duty-bound for the defense of Heilongjiang Province. Since the September 18th Incident last year, the Japanese army has successively occupied the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, and deliberately planned to attack Hei, under the pretext of repairing the Nenjiang Bridge, they attacked our army. Zhanshan immediately went to the front line and tried to defend himself. The two sides exchanged artillery fire for two weeks. Due to poor equipment and running out of ammunition, he retreated to Hailun. The headquarters of the Japanese army repeatedly sent people to say that the military and political authorities of the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin had now agreed on a plan to organize a new regime in the two provinces. After the new regime is established, Japan will withdraw its troops and will not interfere in administrative matters. Now, only Heilongjiang Province is obstructing the situation, causing the entire situation to be unstable. If the security of the three provinces is important, then return to the province immediately, and the Heilongjiang regime will be returned unconditionally. After arriving in the province, the Japanese army will withdraw immediately. At the same time, the pseudo-leaders of the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, instructed by Japan, sent people to say that the new regime was indeed independent in nature. Therefore, he agreed to return to the province to observe the situation and then make a decision. Unexpectedly, after entering the province, the Japanese, as a dignified country, disregarded credibility and immediately broke their promise. Not only did they not withdraw a single soldier, but they used the name of unifying the three provinces to establish a puppet state in order to carry out the steps of aggression and annexation. Therefore, the position of Political Affairs Committee Member, the Governor of Heilongjiang Province, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, were all conferred with false orders. Zhanshan was able to take this opportunity to spy on the lungs of the tyrannical Japanese and the truth about the puppet state, so as to contribute to the noble conference, the only organization that maintains world peace and advocates international justice. This is also a great fortune. Now, the diary of Zhanshan's practical experience in the past month is disclosed to your investigation team for reference. I hope you will review it. February 16, reluctantly followed the Japanese request and took a plane to Liaoning for a meeting. February 17, met with Honjo Shigeru, who claimed that the Japanese army had occupied most of the three eastern provinces, and only a small part of Heilongjiang and Jilin was difficult to resist. Please cooperate with the Japanese. That night, a meeting was held at Zhao Xinbo's residence. The plan proposed by Zhanshan to abolish the pseudo-state was sternly rejected by Itagaki of the Japanese side. The meeting ended without result. February 18, feigned illness and returned to Hailun by car. According to Zhao Zhongren's report, on the 19th, the Japanese military headquarters ordered Zhang Jinghui and Zhao Zhongren to lead twelve pseudo-representatives from the three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Hei, who were bought by the Japanese, to Dalian to beg Puyi to be the pseudo-ruler, and instructed Puyi to decline three times, and the representatives urged three times before he agreed to accept the order. March 8, the Japanese repeatedly invited me to Changchun. Zhanshan was planning to make excuses to shirk, but he was afraid of causing suspicion. He had no choice but to go to Changchun to greet Puyi. On the 9th, Puyi took the position of pseudo-ruler. All the ceremonies were presided over by the Japanese. The puppet took the stage. This is what it means. The most hateful thing is that Honjo Shigeru, the president of Japan, monitored Puyi's inauguration and ordered Puyi to respectfully greet him at the station. After repeated requests, a little face was left, and it was agreed that the pseudo-Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu would represent him. It can be seen that Honjo is actually acting as a governor-general. His so-called co-existence and co-prosperity is completely a deceptive trick. March 10, the Japanese side held a pseudo-State Council meeting with Komai and Itagaki holding the Japanese military order. At the same time, it announced that the pseudo-Manchu State government would set up a Director-General of the General Affairs Office, which would be filled by a Japanese, who would be in charge of all the real power of the departments. All government orders could not be executed without the signature and seal of the pseudo-Director-General. March 18, Colonel Staff Officer Itagaki and Pseudo-Director-General Komai stated at the Pseudo-State Council meeting that the Japanese government originally intended to participate in half of the new government and the officials of the Pseudo-Provincial governments, but now it is doing its best to reduce the number, and only adding a few hundred Japanese to the new government in Changchun. It also stated that Japanese residents in the three eastern provinces are nationals of the new country, and all public rights are enjoyed equally with the Manchus. As for whether they renounce Japanese nationality, they have the right to weigh it, and others may not interfere. They will appoint the Director-General of the General Affairs Office and the Director of the Police Department in the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, who will be Japanese, and will be in charge of all the real power of the provinces. All government orders cannot be implemented without their signature and seal. It was also agreed that the appointment of Heilongjiang Province would be postponed for three months. March 16, Honjo Shigeru came to Qiqihar and inspected the Daxing position. During the conversation on the way, (1) the whole of Japan has made a decision, and would rather pay any sacrifice than give up the three eastern provinces; (2) whoever opposes the new government will be completely wiped out by the Japanese army; (3) if any third country comes out to interfere, it has made the final decision to declare war on it; (4) all political lawsuits can be carried out step by step, but must be approved by the Japanese military headquarters and special service agencies in the place where they are stationed before they can be executed. Also, the Pseudo-State Council resolved, (1) all the land in the Northeast that has been released, if the landlord is an official or a soldier, will be confiscated in full. If the number of acres of civilian households is large, then half of it will be bought at the official price, and all of it will be taken over by the pseudo-state for the purpose of immigration by the Japanese government; (2) the Hu-Hai Railway is the hub of grain transportation in Heilongjiang Province. The Japanese and Zhang Jinghui signed a contract to force a mortgage at one-tenth of the price, 3 million yuan, with a term of 50 years, which is no different from permanent occupation. Fearing that Zhanshan would not recognize it, he discussed and supplemented the signature. Although he sternly refused, he has recently been forced to proceed to the Pseudo-Ministry of Communications; (3) planning to establish the Pseudo-State Manzhou Bank, imitating the method of the Korean Bank, in order to manipulate finance and absorb my cream; (4) destroying my country's schools and invading my country's culture. In addition to the troops stationed in the schools, all the textbooks of patriotism issued by the original departments at all levels will be deleted and revised, and supplemented with pro-Japanese ideas, so as to eliminate my nation. Also, Doihara, the head of the special service agency stationed in Harbin, and Suzuki, the commander of the brigade, once stated that Japan has obtained the three eastern provinces, and when the military expenses are sufficient, it will use it as a source of operations to invade Soviet Russia to the north, resist the United States to the east, and gradually reach other countries. The above is the course of events that Zhanshan personally experienced. Now, in each county of the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, there are two Japanese dispatched to handle special affairs. Nothing can be executed without their permission. All newspapers, telegrams, and telephones in the three eastern provinces are controlled by the Japanese behind the scenes, and newspapers have no real public opinion except to follow the Japanese will. Now that your investigation team is about to come east, the Japanese have warned intellectuals that those who have opinions that are unfavorable to Japan will be resolutely dealt with. Those who oppose Japan are broken into their homes, arrested, and killed by the Japanese in the dark, and their families are warned that if they leak the news, they will be treated in the same way. Yan Tingrui, Zhang Kuien, and others were all killed. The so-called public opinion in the three eastern provinces celebrating the establishment of the pseudo-state is all fabricated by the Japanese. Now they are also buying up rogue traitors to promote their virtues. The above is the fact that Zhanshan has investigated. Now I hear that your investigation team has come to our country. Zhanshan has decided to risk the greatest danger to rescue the country and design to come from Qiqihar, which is under the strict surveillance of the Japanese army, and secretly to Heihe, to carry out the duties of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government. All government affairs are in accordance with the central government and are proceeding as usual. The truth about the organization of the Manzhou pseudo-state is presented to your investigation team, which is specially commissioned to come to China, and to those in the world who want to know the truth about this matter. Now, I dare to swear with 120,000 points of sincerity: No one in my three eastern provinces is willing to separate from our country and live outside. Even the officials who are now engaged in the pseudo-government are under the strict surveillance of the Japanese army and have lost their freedom. Please pay special attention to this level and conduct actual investigations to make an honest report, so that the future of world human peace can be guaranteed, and your investigation team's contribution to the world humanity can be immortal. (Below omitted)</p>
<p>After Zhanshan arrived in Baiquan, he telegraphed Liang Zhenduo, the commander-in-chief of the militia, to handle all the military and civilian affairs along the Hu-Hai line, and telegraphed each brigade and regimental commander to earnestly protect the railway and prepare for a counter-attack. After the Hu-Hai line's strength was deployed, he rushed to Heihe to establish the provincial government and held a swearing-in ceremony. He personally led a large army to Hailun and telegraphed the whole country. As soon as Zhanshan arrived in Hailun, the Japanese sent six planes from Qiqihar to drop bombs everywhere, burning down dozens of houses and shops, and more than 30 people were killed by bombs. The soldiers of his department fought fiercely with the Japanese in the south of Hailun City, but eventually retreated due to unfavorable weapons. The enemy planes bombed and scouted almost every day. In the hundreds of miles around Hailun, there was not a village or town that was not attacked by enemy planes. Zhanshan saw that there was no opportunity to take advantage of, and led his troops to retreat north to reorganize the division and plan another counter-attack. At the end of June, he crossed Hu-Hai and advanced towards Suihua, Dongxing, Qingcheng and other counties, and Deng Brigade and the Volunteer Army attacked the northern Ketong, Tongbei, and Dedi counties. Fighting began on July 7 and continued until the end of the month. Although the enemy had sharp weapons, it still could not avoid repeated defeats. It is estimated that more than a thousand enemies were killed before and after, and the counties of Tongbei and Dedi were occupied. Zhanshan himself suffered a minor head injury, but soon recovered. Recently, he has been encouraging soldiers and bravely killing the enemy. Since September 7, he has launched a general attack on Hailun Baiquan. Zhanshan personally went to the front line and occupied Guchengzi. Baiquan will be taken soon. The enemy in Hailun is fleeing in panic, and the morale of our army is also unprecedented. As for the strength of the Hei province, it is thicker than before. It is estimated that there are five brigades of provincial defense forces, two supplementary brigades, and one artillery regiment and guard regiment each. There are also 37,000 formal troops such as dare-to-die teams, pistol teams, and transport battalions. There are about 60,000 volunteers. However, there is a lack of bullets, and I am deeply worried that it will be unsustainable in a long battle. Zhanshan, a martial artist, has been deeply favored by the country for his food, clothing and land. He has the responsibility of guarding the land and the training of loyalty. As long as there is a breath, he will fight the enemy to the last victory. Moreover, the Japanese are against the great principles, unreasonable, and extremely cruel. They have already treated China as fish and meat, and the world as their target. They have abandoned public justice and public agreements and turned a deaf ear to candid words and public opinion. They are going their own way, and they will not stop until they create a great chaos in the world. Those who lose their way get little help. Isn't it Japan? Recently, they have intensified and openly recognized the pseudo-Manzhou State, imitating the old trick of annexing Korea to complete their active continental policy, trying to place our Chinese nation under the Japanese iron hooves. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Zhanshan is guilty and isolated, his knowledge is obstructed, he only knows how to defend the country and protect the land, and he does not worry about dying in battle. I hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will unite as one, and use the strength of 400 million people to meet the great disaster of thousands of years. Do not fight for private grievances, do not harbor factional views, go to it with sincerity, and sharpen it with perseverance. We will never let an inch of our territory be taken by foreigners. Stalin said, "I certainly do not want to occupy an inch of someone else's land, but I also do not want others to occupy an inch of my land." My compatriots across the country, why don't you think about this again and again? Although Zhanshan is foolish, he is willing to encourage each other with the gentlemen of the country.</p>
<h3>Central Government Holds Memorial Week</h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week for the late leader Sun Yat-sen on the morning of the 19th. Those in attendance included Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Wang Luyi, Xiao Jishan, Li Zonghuang, Hong Ludong, Ke Xing'e, and all staff members. Chairman Ye Chucang led the ceremony, and Ju Zheng delivered a report, stating roughly that from the September 18th Incident in Shenyang until now, it has been a year. In this year, the violent Japanese, from forcibly occupying Shenyang to recognizing the puppet organization they single-handedly created, their so-called "Japan-Manchuria Protocol" is exactly like the "Japan-Korea Protocol" from when they annexed Korea. Korea has already fallen, so how can the Northeast expect to survive? We must remember that four million square miles of territory in the Northeast has changed color, and thirty million compatriots in the Northeast are groaning and waiting to be rescued. Recovering our lost territory and restoring our land is our only responsibility and future goal. There are several key points for future efforts: First, we must know shame, for only by knowing shame can we wipe out shame. Second, we must help each other, for only by helping ourselves can we gain the help of others. Third, we must awaken the masses and achieve unity of purpose so that the four words "jointly face national crisis" do not become empty talk. Fourth, we must have a firm determination, for only with a firm conviction can we have the spirit of courage and sacrifice. Now, at a time when the country is in danger and the enemy is deep within, and when traitors are present, our party bears the heavy responsibility of the country. At this critical moment for the survival of the nation, we especially hope that everyone will work together with one heart and one mind to overcome this difficult situation. Each individual must also strive to implement the above points in order to achieve revenge and wipe out shame. The final victory will surely belong to our country. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Actively Deploys Defenses</h3>
<p>Fortresses and Borders Undergoing Extensive Construction of Defensive Works</p>
<p>Plans to Purchase Over Fifty Heavy Artillery Pieces and Anti-Aircraft Guns</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Guangdong military authorities, in order to strengthen defenses and secure the borders, recently dispatched Li Jiezhi, commander of the Humen Fortress, and Zhou Zhi, chief of staff of the Third Army, to inspect various fortresses along the Guangdong border to plan improvements. They have since returned to the province and submitted a report to the authorities regarding the various construction projects needed for review and approval. Currently, apart from the defense of the eastern seaboard of Shantou, which is the responsibility of the Eastern District Commander, in the northern region, Nanhsiung and Jenhua, which border southern Jiangxi, are prioritized for the construction of trenches and the Nanhsiung county wall. On the 10th of this month, the province allocated 50,000 yuan to cover the costs of repairing the city wall. The defensive works in Changjiangwei, Fuxi, and Chengkou, which are located in Jenhua county and interlock with the borders of Jiangxi and Hunan, are more extensive and will require approximately 100,000 yuan in construction costs. Funding for this significant amount is also being arranged, and work is expected to begin soon. Additionally, the new-style defensive works at Humen are also receiving continuous funding for construction. New-style gun emplacements are being added to the Huangpu and Yuzhu fortresses. From Huangpu to the provincial capital, along both the east and west banks of the Pearl River, a solid bunker is being constructed every five miles. All construction materials and designs are in accordance with the regulations of the National Defense Council, using cement and steel as the main materials. Trees will also be planted extensively near the bunkers for camouflage. Many new-style heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns will be needed once these bunkers are completed. The authorities have decided to allocate a portion of the cash proceeds from the sale of National Defense Bonds for the purchase of fortress guns. Negotiations are currently underway with a German trading company to purchase over thirty Krupp-made 16-inch, 12-inch, 10-inch, and 8-inch caliber heavy artillery pieces. Each gun will be accompanied by a number of shells. The guns must be of the latest model and possess strong combat capabilities to qualify. In addition, over twenty anti-aircraft guns will be purchased to defend against aircraft. The total cost for both items is estimated at over two million yuan. It has been learned that the Guangdong Air Force Headquarters recently purchased over ten anti-aircraft guns and established an anti-aircraft gun team to protect aircraft and prevent enemy aircraft from invading. The Air Force has also recently expanded its fleet and purchased five bomber aircraft and over ten parachutes for flight. Trials and demonstrations are scheduled for the 20th. Regarding transportation, the Guangdong-Shaoguan Railway is the only vital transportation artery in northern Guangdong. For military transport, it is particularly important. In order to consolidate defenses, it has been decided to purchase two armored rail cars to facilitate military use. (September 13th)</p>
<h3>Remnant Bandits in Western Fujian Holding Up in Changting</h3>
<p>Luo Binghui's Band is Under Pressure from Various Armies</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The bandit area in western Fujian, after the suppression by the 19th Route Army and the Guangdong Army, has been shrinking daily. It now only occupies the entire county of Changting, half of Longyan and half of Liancheng. In addition, only bandit groups appear in the border areas of Shanghang, Wuping, Yongding, Ninghua, Qingliu, and Ningyang counties, occasionally carrying out raids. The bandit army consists of the pseudo-12th Army, the 3rd Division, and the pseudo-7th Independent Division, 1st Division. The commander of the pseudo-12th Army is Luo Binghui, who is also the commander of the 36th Division. He is currently in the Changting and Ninghua area, engaged in battle with the Zhou Zhiqun unit of the 4th Independent Brigade, attempting to flee into Jianning. The commander of the pseudo-34th Division, You Ruixuan, is between Changting and Shanghang, currently in a standoff with the Huang Renhuan Division of the Guangdong Army. The commander of the pseudo-35th Division, Yang Yuchun, is between Changting and Yongding, engaged in battle with the Zhang Zhen unit of the 49th Division, and even launched a two-pronged attack on Xinluokeng, surrounding the Xiao Brigade of the Zhang Division. Fortunately, the brigade fought its way out, but both sides suffered heavy losses. The commander of the pseudo-7th Independent Division, Zhang Dingcheng, is between Longyan and Liancheng, engaged in battle with the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army and the Longyan Security Regiment. Currently, the city of Longyan has been recovered by the Security Regiment, and the bandits have retreated to Bisha. As for northern Fujian, two thousand Jiangxi bandits recently infiltrated Pucheng and engaged in fierce fighting with the Nie Jinlong Regiment of the 4th Brigade of the provincial defense forces in the Panting Niankeng area. Yesterday, the provincial government telegraphed Liu Shangzhi, the brigade commander of the 56th Division in Jianyang, and Huang Bingwu, the brigade commander of the 4th Brigade of the provincial defense forces in Gutian, to send troops to reinforce them.

<h3>Henan</h3>
<p>Ancient Artifacts Excavated Exhibited at Antiquities Society</p>
<p>Kaifeng Dispatch: The Henan Antiquities Research Society was established in March of this year. It is jointly organized by members recommended by the Academia Sinica and the Henan Provincial Government. Its excavation work is planned to begin with Jun County in northern Henan as a trial area. On April 16th of this year, the excavation team began their work and went to Jun County to work. The team included Guo Baojun, editor of the Institute of History and Philology of Academia Sinica, archaeology team members Wu Jindin, Liu Yuxia, Wang Xiang, Henan Provincial Government representative Ma Yuancai, and Henan University student Liu Yao. The first phase of work was completed on May 18th. A total of 112 pits were dug, covering an area of 728 square meters, with 1,520 cubic meters of soil moved, costing a total of 1,400 work units. The excavation sites were located in Xincun and Dalidian. The Xincun site contained the Black Pottery culture site from the Neolithic Age, the Bronze Age culture site, and four tombs from the Shang and Zhou dynasties. The Dalidian site contained the Red Pottery culture from the Yangshao period, the Black Pottery culture from the Chengziyai period, and the Gray Pottery culture from the Zhou and Qin dynasties. The artifacts unearthed from the three periods included pottery, stone, bone, and shellfish, as well as bronze and jade artifacts from the tombs. After returning from the excavation, the work of sorting began, and preliminary sorting has been completed. Afterwards, the artifacts will continue to be classified and studied, and a detailed report will be compiled. On the 15th of this month, the Society specifically used the Henan National Museum to hold a public exhibition for three days (from the 15th to the 17th).

<h3>Ancient Artifacts of the Chen Family in Weixian Transported to Jinan</h3>
<p>The Stone Carvings with Gilt are the Most Precious</p>
<p>Fu Zengxiang Calls Them Unique in the World</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Chen family of Weixian has the largest collection of ancient artifacts, which are highly valued domestically. Recently, a batch of Qin and Han bricks and tiles and stone carvings from the Six Dynasties were put up for sale. The provincial government, fearing that they would fall into the hands of foreigners, purchased them for 3,000 yuan and ordered the Provincial Library to properly preserve them. The ancient artifacts, packed in twenty bags and twenty-one boxes, arrived in Jinan yesterday. It so happened that former Minister of Education Fu Zengxiang was visiting Mount Lao and came to Jinan. Hearing that the library had a large collection of books, he specifically came to visit, examining the book catalogs for reference. The library director, Wang Xiantang, guided Fu to visit the newly arrived Chen family's artifacts. However, the bricks and tiles were packed in bags and sealed tightly, awaiting the joint inspection by officials from the provincial government and the Department of Education in the coming days. The Six Dynasties stone carvings were on display outside, available for rubbing and appreciation. There were twenty stone carvings in total. Among them, one was two feet high, circular in shape, with a diameter of over one foot. The surrounding area was carved with sixteen Buddha statues, with five or six sections of inscriptions, totaling 247 characters, listing the surnames of the sculptors, etc., in various styles. There were also inscriptions such as "Great Qi Tianbao Yi Mao Year." The most valuable aspect was that the carvings were gilt, and when touched, they still shined brightly. According to Fu Zengxiang, gilt bronze statues are not very rare, but gilt stone Buddha statues are unique and truly valuable. Wang Xiantang said that when the ancient artifacts were being transported from Weixian, the stone carvings were piled in a corner of a dark room, covered in thick dust. When they were moved out and wiped clean, the presence of gilt was discovered, startling the owner who was filled with regret. His family members also criticized him with various remarks. In the end, it was too late, and nothing could be done. Someone even approached the transport personnel, offering to leave the gilt stone carving for 3,000 yuan, while allowing the rest to be transported to Jinan. The transport personnel, under orders, dared not make such a decision and declined. This shows how valuable the item is. It is fortunate that the library was able to preserve and collect it.</p>
<h3>Westward Journey (23)</h3>
<p>The Past of Yanchang Petroleum</p>
<p>We will visit the petroleum mine tomorrow morning (August 1st), so the current situation will hopefully be reported in detail in our next communication. This time, I will first summarize the past situation of Yanchang Petroleum as follows: Oil Mine Area: Petroleum is a liquid mineral. Scholars generally believe that it is formed from marine animal matter in the Paleozoic era, or that it is converted from organic matter buried in the ground by the action of water vapor over a long period. In our country, petroleum-producing areas in the Yellow River basin include Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, etc.; those in the Yangtze River basin include Hunan, Hubei, etc.; and those in the Pearl River basin include Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, etc. Oil mines have also been discovered in other areas such as Xinjiang and the Northeast. Sichuan's Fushun, Leshan, Angsheng, Minzhong, Chengdu, and Baxian areas, Shanxi's Jincheng, Changzhi, Huoxian, Qin County, Linfen, and Pingding areas, and Tibet are particularly rich in petroleum.</p>
<p>The distribution of Shaanxi's oil mines is roughly in the basins of the Luo River, Yan River, and Wuding River, covering a very large area. Oil seepages are found from Jia County and Mizhi in the north to Yijun and Tongguan in the south, and from An'sai in the west to the Yellow River in the east.</p>
<p>Yanchang County is the center of the Shaanxi Northern Oilfield. Oil seepages are often found from Yichuan in the south to Yanchuan in the north, and from Fushi and Ganquan in the west, roughly between 110 degrees east longitude and 36 degrees latitude.</p>
<p>The Late Qing Dynasty: The history of Yanchang petroleum exploitation has been quite long. (1) In the 21st year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Germans came to Yan'an to investigate petroleum and gained a general understanding of it, arousing their desire. (2) In the 29th year of Guangxu, Yu Yanbiao of Dali and Zheng Mingde of Yan'an, among others, privately contracted with Nagan of Germany and the Shichang Foreign Firm of German merchants to implement exploitation. However, Fan Zengxiang, the Provincial Administration Commissioner, discovered this and stopped it. The Qing court and the Germans argued strongly, and it was finally recovered by the state. (3) In the 30th year of Guangxu, in October, Governor Cao Hongxun requested permission to try to operate the Yanchang Petroleum Mine, which was approved. Consequently, in the 31st year, Magistrate Hong was sent to Hubei to order copper yuan machinery. Following the order of the Mining Bureau, he brought more than ten catties of petroleum samples to refine at the factory in Hankou, and was also commissioned to hire craftsmen to purchase all the machinery. When Hong arrived in Hankou, he invited Japanese nationals Masashi Abe and chemist Koki Inabe to conduct chemical experiments, which yielded excellent results. As a result, the Japanese were hired to come to Shaanxi to try to operate the mine. After Abe arrived in the province, he went with Shen Xirong, a county magistrate appointed by the province, to investigate the site. One location was at Yanwugou, fifteen li outside the east gate, where he saw a slight fissure under a large rock, with only a small amount of oil seepage. The second location was at Liaoziyuan, northeast of the county. The third location was at Hujia Chuan, fifteen li from the city. Although petroleum was produced, it was all stone mountains, and it would be very labor-intensive. The fourth location was near the Bin River outside the west gate, where there was a well that had been silted up with sand and stones for many years, and its location was lost. After the location was discovered, people were immediately ordered to excavate it. It was a half-sand, half-soil area. After digging seven or eight feet deep, oil came out with the water, and more than ten catties of oil could be obtained every day. The fifth location was on the riverbank outside the east gate, where a well was dug, and more than ten catties of oil could be produced every day. The sixth location was outside the south gate, where more than twenty catties of oil could be obtained every day. Later, River Ministry recommended the Japanese national Yakuro Sato as a technician, signed a contract, and went to Yan'an to start operations. All the machinery was ordered by Sato, and the defense army was allocated to repair the rugged road between Xi'an and Yanchang in sections, which was completed by the winter of the 32nd year. The machinery also arrived, and construction began in the 33rd year. Work began on April 25th of that year (the current first step), and by the end of the month, it had been dug to a depth of twenty-three feet. In May, it was dug to a depth of seventy-three feet. In June, due to the thickness of the stone layer, it was dug to a depth of fifty-seven feet. On July 13th, the oil and gas in the well were boiling. By the end of the month, it had been dug to a depth of seventy-three feet. From April 25th to the end of July, it had been dug to a total depth of two hundred and twenty-six feet. On the morning of August 2nd, more than two hundred catties of petroleum were extracted with a simple cylinder. A dozen catties were extracted at noon, and the same amount was extracted a third time. Three to four hundred catties of oil could be obtained per day. The next day, it was dug another seventeen feet, and trees and roots floated up, tasting salty. Work was then stopped. This was the excavation of the first well in Yanchang Petroleum. In the past, more than one hundred catties of oil could be extracted per hour. Sato then went to the province on August 26th, and fourteen boxes of petroleum were transported to Xi'an in September. In October, Governor Cao Hongxun requested that it be changed to a joint government-commercial venture. (4) In the second lunar month of the first year of Xuantong, the second well began to be excavated. The location was at the Laoyingpan area, five hundred and forty-six feet west of the first well. Supervisor Yao Zheng guo used manual labor to try to dig the oil well. Work began on the eighth day of the month, with four stonemasons. The well mouth was five feet in diameter. On the fifteenth day, it was twenty-four feet and three inches deep, encountering a layer of sand and stone, and only four or five inches were dug per day. Because the ground was cold, the workers burned charcoal for warmth, suffocating the well, resulting in one death. The well was stopped. (5) In the second year of Xuantong, students Yang Yihong and Japanese nationals Otsuka, among others, came to Yanchang City, Leijiatan, Zhangjiatan, Hujia Chuan, Liaoziyuan, Yanwugou, Qiaojia Shiliaodeng, surveyed the oil fields, and tried to dig the Liaoziyuan oil mine manually. Soon, it was stopped. In October, Otsuka's contract expired and he returned to his country. He surveyed a total of four places and drew four maps. He estimated twenty oil wells inside and outside Yanchang County, two oil wells in Hujia Chuan, ten li east of the county, six in Liaoziyuan, twenty li east of the county, and seven in Qiaojia Shike, fifteen li west of the county. In total, he estimated thirty-five oil wells in four places. (6) In the first month of the third year of Xuantong, preparations were made to open the second well. On the eleventh day, it was eighty-five feet deep. On the twenty-sixth day, it was three hundred and fifteen feet deep, and oil was seen, producing more than two hundred catties of crude oil per day. Work was stopped on the fifth day of the third lunar month, at a total depth of three hundred and twenty feet, extracting more than three hundred catties of crude oil per day. On the twenty-ninth day, student Wu Yuanli prepared to open the third well on a high slope north of the first well. In May, the third well was dug to a depth of three hundred and sixty feet. On June 10th, it was five hundred and forty-nine feet deep. Work was stopped because there was no oil. The fourth well was opened in August, at Leijia Nan. Because a vertical boiler was used, it was not very suitable, and the project progressed very slowly. In September, the revolution broke out and it was suspended.</p>
<p>Since the Republic of China: The situation of Yanchang Petroleum Mine since the first year of the Republic of China will be described separately as follows:</p>
<p>First year: From January to June, bandits broke into the city factory several times, causing significant losses. In July, Governor Zhang Fenghui appointed Zhang Yunyao as the oil factory manager. In this year, the fourth well in Leijiatan was continued to be dug, to more than forty zhang, and work was stopped due to not finding oil. In May of the second year, Governor Zhang Fenghui appointed Guan Bu Han and Liu Liansheng as the general manager and deputy manager. In July, bandits attacked Yanchang, and the factory was almost spared, relying on the joint efforts of all parties to defend against the bandits and remain unharmed. In October, Zhang Zuocheng was sent to Shanghai and Hankou to purchase mechanical parts and sulfuric acid.</p>
<p>Third year: Inspector Niu Chuan Shan appointed Zhang Yuan as the general manager. He arrived in May. The Puli Petroleum Company was established, and a Sino-American joint oil mine agreement was established. A test well was opened near Yanchang. In October, the first oil refining furnace room was lost due to negligence.</p>
<p>Fourth year: The Sino-American Oil Mine Affairs Office prepared to buy land and dig wells in Yanwugou, Yanchang, Yan'an, Yijun, etc., but stopped due to poor results. In December, the Ministry of Finance received three thousand taels of silver, and due to the strong oil production of the first well, it was planned to expand the project.</p>
<p>Fifth year: In March, Zhang Yuan was killed in Ganquan. Bandits attacked the city twice. The oil wells and oil veins suddenly became strong. The Sino-American Oil Mine Affairs Office was closed, and all foreigners left. In April, the province appointed Sun Mao as the general manager, but he did not go north due to road blockages. He reappointed Magistrate Zhang Fu as the co-manager to take care of it nearby. In July, the province appointed Zhang Bingchang as the general manager. On July 25, bandit Li Qinglan led hundreds of people to flee south, stationed at Hujia Chuan, ten li from the factory, threatening to attack the city. Then they roared away again. From then on, there was no peace day or night for several months.</p>
<p>Sixth year: In March, the repair of the second and third oil refining furnaces was completed, and the manufacturing capacity doubled. On June 14, the cavalry stationed in Yan'an mutinied thirty li from the factory, but it was not disturbed. In July, the manufacture of gun oil began. In August, the Yan River flooded, reaching a height of three zhang, and the stone wall of the east factory was completely washed away.</p>
<p>Seventh year: Bandits in the northern mountains rose up, and people were panicked. The factory could only maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Eighth year: The second well was only a dozen zhang from the first well, and the output increased or decreased mutually. The second well was filled with steel blocks and iron ropes by bandit Cao Lao Jiu, and it has not been possible to retrieve them to this day, becoming an abandoned well.</p>
<p>Ninth year: A major earthquake occurred in the winter of October with no losses.</p>
<p>Tenth year: In October, the Provincial Assembly resolved to determine the share capital of the oil factory's old property and recruit merchants to operate it, and requested the governor to approve and implement it.</p>
<p>Eleventh year: It was planned to implement joint government-commercial operation and organize a company, but it was shelved indefinitely due to no one subscribing for shares.</p>
<p>Twelfth year: In September, the province appointed Zhao Guobin as the general manager, with some improvements.</p>
<p>Thirteenth year: In the spring, General Manager Zhao Guobin went to Tianjin to purchase machinery and hire two technicians. He returned to Yan'an in April and immediately used manual labor to dig the fifth well inside the west gate of the county. This well has been more than ten years, more than thirty zhang deep, and has not yet seen oil, so work was stopped. In August, the sixth well was opened with machinery on the mountain behind the east factory, reaching a depth of more than thirty zhang, and oil seepage was seen. Initially, the oil volume was still high, but it gradually decreased day by day.</p>
<p>Fourteenth year: In July, the seventh well was opened on the south bank of the Yan River. In November, work was stopped due to malfunctioning machinery and severe cold weather.</p>
<p>Fifteenth year: In January, General Manager Zhao Guobin went to Shanghai to purchase well-drilling machinery. Due to frequent civil wars, the parts were not transported to the factory until the sixteenth year.</p>
<p>Sixteenth year: The general manager was changed twice in March. In September, the troops stationed in northern Shaanxi mutinied in Qingjian and attacked Yanchang. The oil factory was looted, causing significant losses.</p>
<p>Seventeenth year: The general manager was changed to supervisor, and Bao Entu was appointed by the Construction Department. The plan was to first drill new oil wells and then expand.</p>
<p>Eighteenth year: In January, Supervisor Bao Entu drafted a new well plan and budget, and submitted it to the provincial government and Construction Department for approval. The new well started on May 4 of this year. The location was (1) between the northwest direction of the first oil factory and the half small slope at 25 and a half degrees, about one hundred zhang from the old well and more than one hundred zhang from the west bank of the Yan River; (2) Reference was made to the oilfield area map made by the Japanese national Otsuka, surveyed the slope and orientation of the surface stone layer, and the outcrops of oil seepage, and selected the location. On May 1, the depth was drilled to 51.8 zhang, reaching the oil vein, and the oil production was very strong. Since this work until the evening of August 1, the drill head was pulled out, with a lot of sticky oil. Therefore, the result of the water suction bucket test showed that a large amount of petroleum was absorbed. On the 2nd, petroleum was absorbed one hundred and thirty dan, or 6,500 catties, in twelve hours. On the 12th, the new well produced a lot of oil, and more than 20,000 catties of crude oil could be produced every day and night. However, according to Bao Jun, this situation lasted only about one or two months, and now it can only produce about two or three hundred catties of oil per day (the future situation will continue to be investigated and reported).</p>

<p>Public Security Bureau Officer Wounded While Arresting Gamblers: The harvest of unmatured cotton in the four rural villages this year can be predicted to be abundant. Now that the early rice is ripe and the New Abundance Festival is approaching, teahouses in rural markets and small towns often entice people to gamble. The savings accumulated by farmers through hard work throughout the year are completely wasted. Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jing has issued an order to the subordinate branch offices to strictly prohibit rural farmers from gambling. Yesterday, it was reported that there was gambling in Xiaomengjiang Temple. Bureau Chief Shen immediately ordered Special Agent Yang and four other special agents to direct the police to arrest the ringleaders. It is unknown how, but the pistol he was carrying suddenly went off, the bullet pierced his leg, and he suffered a slight injury. Six gamblers and gambling tools were captured on the spot and taken back to the headquarters for interrogation.

Unexpectedly, they arrived at Baimao Town again. The place was more remote and there were no stationed police teams. The refugees first went to the home of Zhou Buqing, a resident, and searched for an hour. Then they went to other neighbors and searched door-to-door, but most of them were poor, so they gained little. The refugees then boarded the boat and sailed away. After the incident, it was checked that the Zhou family was looted of gold, silver jewelry, and clothing worth more than three hundred yuan. The district office has reported to the county for arrest.</p>

<h3>Will it fall by the wayside from this point on?</h3>
<p>No Prospect of Re-establishing the Lok Wah Football Team</p>
<p>Yu Hengzhi has Recently Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Talk of Li Huitang Going to Java</p>
<p>The Lok Wah Football Team, which has been declining for years, has been unable to continue due to lack of responsible people and financial difficulties, resulting in silence and inaction. With the football season about to begin, Chinese teams such as the East China Team are sharpening their swords and preparing for the war, but nothing has been heard from the Lok Wah Team. Yesterday, the reporter met Yu Hengzhi, the former executive of the team, at the Sports Advancement Association and asked about the progress of Lok Wah this season. According to the conversation, he has been doing business in Qingdao and only arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. He is completely unaware of the affairs of Lok Wah. He does not even know whether it will join the Western League Football Association this season. Finally, he said that he would have to return to Qingdao after February. When asked about the recent situation of "Li the Ball Demon," he replied that he would soon be going to Java from Hong Kong to do business. (National News Agency)</p>

<h3>Madame Maudy</h3>
<p>Studying Art in Europe</p>
<p>Denies Leaving Tennis Life</p>
<p>(Paris Dispatch) Madame Maudy, the queen of world women's tennis, once again won the championships of the French Open and Wimbledon this year. She seems to be no longer participating in the competition this season and is currently studying art wholeheartedly in Europe. However, Madame denies that she will give up her tennis life, so the United States can rest assured that it will not lose the female hero who is winning glory for the United States on the grass. Madame made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Studying Painting in Europe for Five Months: I will never give up my tennis life because I love tennis more than anything else. I am still continuing to practice in Europe and have never slackened off. I have decided to spend this summer studying art, so I will not be able to continue to defend the US Women's Championships. I plan to stay in Europe for five months, painting and studying painting, but I have not yet decided which school to attend.</p>
<p>Social Life in Europe: The social life in Europe will never make me leave tennis. I love it madly and always will. Although I don't practice much in Europe, meeting players from different countries in different venues has greatly increased my taste. I participated in two European competitions this summer, one in the capital of the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Commenting on Koa and Barnes: Regarding recent comments from world stars, Madame said, Koa will definitely do well in the United States, but according to Madame's observation, I'm afraid he won't be as successful as he is in Europe. (Following Madame's insights, Koa was indeed defeated by Barnes.) As for Barnes, without a doubt, he is an excellent player who will be able to maintain his dominance for a long time, and his golden age has not yet fully arrived, and his future is limitless.</p>
<h3>Marriage is Like the Decathlon</h3>
<p>First Place in the World Women's Hurdles</p>
<p>Miss Dietrichson's Wonderful Analogy</p>
<p>(Chicago, August 19th Dispatch) Miss Dietrichson of Texas, whose hurdles skills are the best in the world for women, made a world record of 11.7 seconds this time. She made a very wonderful speech here last night, comparing marriage to the decathlon. The lady pointed out the following items: (1) washing dishes; (2) scrubbing utensils; (3) washing clothes; (4) cooking; (5) managing babies; (6) cleaning houses; (7) shopping in department stores; (8) paying attention to the refrigerator (9) tidying up bedding; (10) mending socks.</p>
<h3>Italian Women Preparing</h3>
<p>To Participate in the Next Olympics</p>
<p>What About Chinese Women?</p>
<p>(Rome Dispatch) This World Olympics will enable Italian women to re-enter the sports world, and the government's regulations prohibiting women from participating in sports competitions will be broken. Interior Minister Abinati, chairman of the Italian Olympics Committee, said, Italy only sent one woman to participate in Los Angeles this time, but considering the countries that scored this time, such as the United States, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and the Netherlands, women actually accounted for a considerable number of the scores. However, all of our country's (Italy) scores were from men. The difference between Italy's scores and the United States' scores is so great. Whether women score or not is also a major reason that we must pay attention to. Although there are no women to be selected in Italy, it is also because Italy is not prepared. Italian women must begin preparing for the next Olympics.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Financial News: Gold Price High at 4 Taels 3 Mace</h3>
<p>India Re-Rumored to Sell Silver Bars: Yesterday, the 19th, the gold price continued to be sharp. Although there were no drastic changes, there were often 2 or 3 tael fluctuations. The total difference for the day was 8 taels, eventually rising 4 taels and some odd mace. Initially, it rose due to the silver market reporting a drop, once breaking through 730 taels. However, as the foreign exchange rate strengthened and then loosened, many parties, having already made profits, took the opportunity to sell, causing the price to turn downwards. In the morning and noon, there was a slight foreshadowing, and the market gradually turned from flat to high. It was probably because the foreign exchange rate was quite tight, and the dealers first suppressed and then scrambled. Banks still had good appetites, especially with rumors from foreign news that India was selling a large number of silver bars. People's hearts were extremely firm, and a buying frenzy suddenly arose, greatly invigorating the market, so the price flourished and a new price of 732 taels suddenly appeared. As for the amount of bars held by various firms, it was less than 17,000 bars, and due to the impact of short sellers, the detailed situation of the market before and after is as follows:</p>
<p>Morning Slightly Fluctuating: Starting from 728 taels and 3 mace for November, which was 1 tael and 1 mace higher. The previous day, the large bars had shrunk by 16 and 3/3, but the Bank of America only had a small eighth. However, the forward prices were repeatedly reported small, and the Bank of China also lowered, so it was able to hold steady. Then, small retail sellers came out, immediately retreating to 27 taels and a half. Soon, Yuankangxiang, Hengyu, and others scrambled to buy. As for the US dollar, it also showed strength. Huabi bought December at 6875, so the price jumped by several mace, but only fluctuated by several mace. At 9:00, it was 30 taels and 4 mace. Later, because the December US dollar at 6875 was difficult to sell, it should have been 75. In addition, Xie Xing, Yong Heng Xing, and Yuan came out to dump 4 taels. At 9:20, it was 26 taels and a half. At that time, it returned up 1 tael. HSBC's listed price was consistent and did not change. Da Decheng, Tian Fengyong, and others went on the market to sell. Also, the US dollar of this month could fluctuate by half a yuan. At 10:00, it was 25 taels and 5 mace. After this, the buyers became active, and the gold price suddenly rose by 3 taels, but at times it hovered around 1 tael. At 11:00, it was 28 taels and 4 mace, then it was suppressed by a small 1 tael, 2 or 3 mace, and then rebounded by about 2 taels, because Yuan Heng, Yuan Mao, Yuan Maoyong, and Bing Xing all entered. At 11:30, it was 28 taels and 9. Unexpectedly, suddenly the selling atmosphere permeated. Yuan Xingyong, Hong Xing, and others sold very hard. Also, a speculator named Luo also came out, but Wan Xing and Shunli bought in without slackening. The price had already fallen by 3 taels and several mace, until at 11:45 it finally became 25 taels. Fortunately, Wan Xing and others continued to drag it in, immediately pulling it up 1 tael. Unexpectedly, people's hearts were not firm, and the noon closing was 21 taels and 3 mace, and then it went up to 5 taels and a half, but there were no large entries or exits.</p>
<p>Afternoon Increasingly Sharp: The afternoon market opened at 25 taels. Da Xingyong and Yuan Xingyong were the first to come out, immediately losing 1 tael, to 24 taels. After entering, Yifengyong, Hengyu, Da Decheng, and others bought in one after another, gradually adding more than 1 tael. At 3:10, it was 25 taels and 8 mace, but there was a fluctuation of 1 tael, and then it went down by 7 or 8 mace. Around 3:30, it was 25 taels. The market situation was mediocre. Unexpectedly, in an instant, news of Reuters' report that India had a large number of silver sales arrived. The market suddenly became sharp. Wheat firms and others absorbed December US dollars at 8125, and November closed at 625. The buying frenzy in the market rose, and the price was a riot of 5 or 6 taels, but the floating quantity was limited. At 3:50, it was 31 taels. Unexpectedly, Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, and Zhifengyong suddenly came to sell, and Yuan Kangxiang also sold 600 or 700 bars, so the price immediately fell sharply by more than 2 taels. At 4:10, it was 28 taels and 4 mace. Then, because the foreign exchange market was especially strong and Fuyu, Da Decheng, and others bought in, small retail short sellers rushed to cover, greatly stimulated. At 4:20, it reached 32 taels and then slightly fell by 7 or 8 mace, to 31 taels and 1 mace. By the closing, it was 31 taels and a half, an increase of 4 taels and 3 mace compared to last Saturday. According to the full day, the maximum price was 32 taels and the minimum was 24 taels, a difference of 8 taels. The red bar was calculated to have increased by 14 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Double Settlement Price: The opening price for the US dollar was unchanged, still 800 taels, calculated to be pressed at 71 taels to 75 taels. In the afternoon, it was 75, 6 taels to 68 taels, a decrease of 4 or 5 taels compared to last Saturday. At the exchange's double settlement price, the front market was 35 taels for September and October, 25 taels for November, and the back market was 42 taels to 32 taels, with a water supplement of 31 taels and 38 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Very Troublesome Entries and Exits for Various Firms: On the trading floor, there were more offers than demands in the front market, and more buyers in the back market. According to statistics, Yuan Maoyong, Yifeng, Wan Xing, Shunli, Futai Heng, Yuan Xingyong, Yuan Kangxiang, Bing Xing, and foreign exchange hedging all entered. Yuan Dayong, Yongfeng, Zhifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Xie Xingyong, Fuxingyong, Da Decheng, Yifengyong, and Luo all exited. Yuan Tai, Hengyu, and Yuan Heng had very troublesome entries and exits. Tian Fengyong had quite a few sales. In the afternoon, Da Decheng, Shunli, Yixing, Yifeng, Zhaofengchang, Tongfengheng, Yongfeng, Richang, Yuan Heng, and Bing Xing all entered. Zhifengyong and Yifengyong entered and then exited. Yuan Xingyong exited and then entered. Yuan Kangxiang and Futai Heng all exited. On that day, the Da Lian gang entered a total of 1,400 or 1,500, exited 400 or 500, and the Guang gang entered more than 400 and exited more than 100.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market Clearly Stable but Secretly Tight</p>
<p>Hedging Transactions Still Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, there were no telegrams for the silver market as usual, but yesterday's report shrank, and the foreign exchange rate seemed to strengthen slightly. Probably because the Shanghai market trend was strong, HSBC's listed price did not change at all, but the domestic market was firm at first and then loose, and in the afternoon it turned from flat to tight again. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the English gold shrank by 125, and the US dollar shrank by only 125, to 1875. Because the foreign exchange rate continued to rise, the US Bank of America slightly fell, and the gold price was flat at first and then sharp, with a new price of 732 taels already seen. People's hearts were quite good. As for the various foreign exchange transactions, they were still relatively active, with an estimated 100,000 pounds of English gold traded. The Jin gang slightly took in and out. Bombay had recently entered. The US dollar may have traded 700,000 or 800,000 yuan. The front market was mostly sold off, and the back market was sold and then scraped back, mostly hedging. The American Bank Corporation entered December. Various banks such as Makali and Japanese merchants all entered. As for the various gold firms that had closed up last week, because the gold price was already high, but it was not a hedge, it was actually to offset the previous short position. By yesterday, some hedging notes were entered to maintain a stable strategy.</p>
<p>English Exchange: The domestic market had a difference of 125 Wheat throughout the day. The opening price in the morning was 1 shilling and 9 pence for September, 0625 for October, 125 for November, and 1875 for December. The bid price was 9 pence 0625 to 25. The noon closing bid price was 9 pence 0625 to 25, and the bid price was 125 to 3125. The afternoon closing selling price was 8 pence 9375 to 125, and the selling price was 9 pence to 1875.</p>
<p>American Exchange: The domestic market fluctuated by 25 throughout the day. The morning opening selling price was 30 yuan 375 for September, 4375 for October, 5625 for November, and 6875 for December. The buying price for each month was increased by 125. The noon closing selling price was 30 yuan 4375 to 75, and the bid price was 5625 to 875. The afternoon closing selling price was 30 yuan 3125 for September and 625 for December, and the buying price was 4375 to 75. Also, one US dollar is equivalent to 3 taels 3 mace 3 fen 3 li 3 hao of silver.</p>
<p>Large Bars Rebounded by 125</p>
<p>The National News Agency's London telegram on the 19th: Large bars rebounded. The closing price was 17 pence 6875 for the near term and 17 pence 8125 for the far term, each up 125 compared to last Saturday. Also, the Anglo-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan 4 jiao 7 fen and a half.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Situation at the Beginning of the Week</p>
<p>The bank's collection and disbursement situation this Monday was not as prosperous as the last time, because silver was loose for a long time and there were few uses for it. Therefore, although the transactions were combined for two days after the weekend holiday, they were not very tight. As for the foreign dollar market, the morning price rose due to active bank buying and selling, but the afternoon market suddenly had too much selling pressure, making it difficult for the price to stabilize, and it eventually fell by a small 75. It can be seen that the time for peak usage has not yet arrived. If it encounters ordinary fatigue, there will be downstream action. ▲Cents Up and Down, Interest on Loans to White Borrowing: The "foreign cent" in the early market was 6 qian 9 fen 5 li half, which suddenly rebounded by 1 li compared to the previous afternoon. In the afternoon market, because the situation was sluggish and soft, it fell again by 7 hao and a half, to 6 qian 9 fen 4 li 7 hao and a half. As a result, it was 2 hao and a half better than the previous morning. The "silver interest" in the early market only opened at 2 fen, and in the afternoon market it returned to white borrowing. Adding water to the scratch head was 4 or 5 fen. The silver capital was loose, so there is no hope of rising in recent days.</p>
<p>Jiao Up and Down, Copper Coins Greatly Shrinking: The Jiangnan small foreign in the early market was 6 qian 01 li, and in the afternoon market it was 6 qian 04 li. As a result, it was 1 li better than the previous day. The trading volume was 5,000 jiao in the early market and 7,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The Guangdong small foreign was 5 qian 9 fen in the early market and 5 qian 8 fen 8 li half in the afternoon market. As a result, it was slightly more than half a hao better. The trading volume was 125,000 jiao in the early market and 35,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins flew down by 3,000 wen, to 426,000 wen, a huge shrinkage of 6,000 wen between the two markets. The transaction volume was more than 41,300 strings.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Collection and Disbursement Transaction Situation: "Silver Funds": Yesterday, the bank's collection and disbursement included 3.3 to 3.4 million for Chinese merchant collection and disbursement, 2.7 to 2.8 million for foreign merchant collection and disbursement, 10.78 million for various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and miscellaneous collections and disbursements, 400,000 entering the warehouse, 500,000 leaving the warehouse, 1.4 to 1.5 million in pawn transactions, 31 million in cash shop and silver official single collection and disbursement, 4.7 million in scratch head fund collection and disbursement, and 900,000 in collection and disbursement from various routes. The straight collection and disbursement of cash, one foreign exchange exchange scratch ticket, made 780,000 in the early market and 1.195 million in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 20,000 in the early market and 60,000 in the afternoon market. Over-the-counter banknotes were 140,000 in the early market and 90,000 in the afternoon market. Check transactions were 50,000 in the early market and 40,000 in the afternoon market. Bank buying and selling, mutual market was 800,000 in the early market and 950,000 in the afternoon market. More than 1.7 million in foreign accounts between various banks were collected and disbursed, and more than 2.2 million banknotes were recovered and issued. More than 6.5 million in foreign pawn transactions were carried out in cash shops, and more than 2.1 million in foreign scratch head funds were collected and disbursed. More than 2 million in foreign loans were borrowed in and out, more than 400,000 went to the stomach, and more than 800,000 were traded in small cash shops.</p>
<p>Securities: Bond Prices Slightly Firmer in the Afternoon Market</p>
<p>Yesterday (19th), the bond market situation of the Chinese merchant securities exchange: Only 3,000 yuan of 19 Customs was traded in the spot market in the morning, and 1,000 yuan each of 19 Guan and 20 Guan. There was no market for the rest of the day. Although the futures trading was slightly more than last week, the main next month period was generally opened, but the market was still calm and buying and selling continued to lack development. It is estimated that the trading volume before and after the market was 2.88 million yuan. In the two sessions in the morning, the market sentiment was dull and the supply and demand was very flat. The price fluctuation was very small, and there was almost no change compared to last weekend. However, the two sessions in the afternoon were slightly better. Retail investors were engaged in taking in, and the conversion replenishment was also slightly more, so the demand was stronger and all prices unanimously recovered and strengthened. As a result, it was more than last week with an increase of 2 or 3 jiao. The bond market situation may be difficult to develop temporarily.</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Slightly Down</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On Saturday (17th), the New York stock market was in a state of fluctuation, with minimal ups and downs. Initially, it was firm, but later, public expectations of significant losses for U.S. Steel in the current quarter led to increased selling, causing prices to fall back. As a result, it closed slightly lower than the previous day. The volume of trading for half a day totaled 700,000 shares. From September 3rd to 10th, the number of freight cars totaled 501,824, a decrease of 57,903 from the previous week. This was due to the Labor Day holiday and did not represent an actual decrease, therefore not affecting the stock market. Considering the inability of commodity prices to rise and the likelihood that industry reports for this quarter will not be entirely satisfactory, even with talk of the Republican Party propping up the stock market again, it can be asserted that the market will not be able to return to its original state in the very short term. The Dow Jones averages are recorded below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>20 Industrial Stocks　66.44　Down 0.66</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks　32.04　Down 0.04</p>
<p>30 Utility Stocks　29.11　Down 0.27</p>
<p>40 Bonds　80.93　Up 0.15</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn: Yarn Prices Higher than Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market opened lower but rose in the afternoon, as it is currently the peak season for autumn sales, and the harvest in various provinces is bountiful this year. Demand from merchant groups is expected to drive some activity. However, with rice prices being too low, farmers' economic conditions remain difficult. Therefore, there is still no significant business in current yarn. Sales are relatively brisk in the southern regions, causing a tightening in the supply of base yarn. Yarn prices are higher than cotton prices. If the market can stabilize, there is still hope for the sales of current yarn.</p>
<p>Human Cotton Futures: Morning Drop, Afternoon Recovery</p>
<p>The human cotton futures market opened with declining prices due to the continuous fall of American cotton. Market sentiment was weak, and there was increased selling to close positions. However, Rongxing's bulls did not loosen their grip, and contracts for all months fell by 9 cents to 1.1, 2, 3 cents.

<p>Cotton Market: Downturn Intensifies</p>
<p>American cotton has fallen for five consecutive days, and the downward trend is intensifying, causing significant turmoil in the local cotton market. Favorable weather conditions are also conducive to the entry of new cotton into the market, making the situation increasingly panicked. Sellers, seeing the poor atmosphere, are also taking advantage of the situation to sell, so the downward trend is intensifying. Contracts for all months have broken through the 2-tael mark. However, the demand for spot cotton in the market is still good.</p>
<p>Zheng Cotton Futures: Fall of 56 Cents</p>
<p>The Zheng cotton futures market opened lower, with American spot cotton breaking through the 7-cent mark, leading to increased selling pressure. Contracts for all months fell by 5.6 cents. In the afternoon, some who profited closed their positions, causing a rebound of 1.5 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 121,000 dan. Sales: Shenchang 10,400 dan, Dafu 2,800 dan, Suilong 5,500 dan, Renfeng 5,000 dan, Xincheng 2,500 dan, Xingchang 4,200 dan.

<p>Indian and English Cotton Industry Weekly Report</p>
<p>Bombay: Since the release of the American cotton report, prices have continued to fall. This week, due to political conditions and holidays, the situation is chaotic. Considering the gradual increase in activity over the next two months, the future outlook is rarely optimistic. Export inquiries from Europe and the Far East have slightly increased, but their impact is minimal after a long period of inactivity. Regarding harvest conditions, except for the United Provinces, the weather is generally sunny. There has also been some progress in the Central Provinces and Central India. The statistics for the past week are appended below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>1931　1932</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts from September 1st　25　86</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory　62　761</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports from September 1st　40　54</p>
<p>Exports to Europe　13　6</p>
<p>Exports to China　11　丨</p>
<p>Exports to Japan　13　48</p>

<p>Liverpool: Spot sales were very good last week. Since the release of the American cotton report, speculative sentiment in futures has been very poor. Despite news such as the resolution of the Lancashire strike, unfavorable American cotton weather, cotton crop damage, and good news from Alexandria, it still could not reverse the inclination to sell. Egyptian cotton prices fluctuated due to the softness of American cotton and the upward trend in Alexandria.</p>
<p>Grains: Rice Market Situation Stabilizes</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, the supply from the western routes was not abundant, reaching about the 245th shipment. Sales in urban and rural areas were stronger than the previous market. Merchants continued to purchase early and late rice from Qinghai, Fenglian, and Tinglin, stabilizing the opening situation. Changxi northern粳 and Suzhou merchants showed weak demand, and prices appeared tired. Glutinous rice shops had limited business, and prices were slightly firm.</p>
<p>Xin Zha: In the rice market, there were a total of 17 or 18 rice boats from various merchants on the inside roads. The number of people visiting the market in the morning was very small. Changli 厚 rice broke through to set a fixed high, with ordinary goods experiencing a slight drop of 2 角. New 洋杜尖 and new 粳 rice experienced a drop of nearly 角. Early rice was sold as soon as it arrived, with no change in price. The total volume of transactions for the day was approximately 2,300 to 2,400 shi.</p>
<p>Saigon Cargo Gradually Becomes Active</p>
<p>All Rice Types Are Firm and Popular</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of foreign rice picked up. Saigon rice has a limited inventory, and shipments have been cut off for a long time, allowing for a lively market turnaround. In addition to continued inquiries from local merchants on the Japanese street, there was also interest from Hankou and northern merchants. A total of 1,500 bags were offered, with Hankou and northern merchants accounting for the majority of purchases. The demand for small 絞米 also improved, with over 1,000 bags being sold yesterday. Market prices were similar to the previous market, but market sentiment and conditions were trending upward. If there is active buying from local merchants again today and tomorrow, prices are expected to rise further, and Saigon rice is particularly expected to increase in price. Sales were opened for Saigon No. 1 rice at 9 yuan 6 jiao to 4 jiao and a half, and small 絞米 at 8 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen to 4 jiao.</p>
<p>Flour Prices Unlikely to Be High</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened with prices showing an initial flat and then stable trend for all months. With foreign wheat quotations showing a difference of 4-5 fen, market sentiment initially did not appear to be good. However, due to very limited selling pressure, manufacturers took a wait-and-see attitude, causing market sentiment to gradually recover, with prices rising by 1 fen compared to the previous week's closing price. As trading continued into the afternoon opening until the third session, transactions were very quiet, and buying and selling were not enthusiastic. After the fourth session, trading resumed with the report that Fufeng and Xinda had jointly secured a ship of No. 2 foreign wheat at a price of 3 liang 7 qian and a half. As a result, the market dumped goods, and the market price fell again. Considering that manufacturers are unwilling to give up ordering foreign wheat, it will be difficult to expect prices to rise high in the future. As a result, the current month was better by 5 li compared to the previous week, October was better by 1 fen, November and December were better by 5 li, January was better by 2.5 li, and February was better by 7.5 li.</p>
<p>Wheat Market Suddenly Tightens in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw generally fluctuating prices and quiet trading in all months after the morning opening. However, the market atmosphere suddenly tightened during the afternoon opening. This was due to the rebounding of the flour market in the morning and the purchasing of foreign wheat by eastern merchants, leading to a bullish trend. Sellers were unwilling to loosen their grip, and market sentiment was driven up. However, whether this kind of speculation is worthy of attention is still difficult to predict. As a result, the current month was better by 1 fen compared to the previous week, October was better by 3 fen, November was better by 5 fen, December was better by 4 fen, January remained unchanged, and February was better by 2 fen. The spot wheat market remains stable, with Yaowan wheat opening at 3 liang 5 qian, secondary at 3 liang 3 qian and a half, Wuxi wheat at 3 liang 4 qian 8 fen, Suqian wheat at 3 liang 4 qian 4 fen, secondary at 3 qian and a half, totaling 4,500 bags.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Slightly Up</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm Report: On Saturday (17th), Chicago wheat initially fell due to poor export demand, but then rose due to purchases from the East. As a result, the May contract remained unchanged compared to the previous day, while the rest rose slightly. The trading volume on the 16th totaled 20 million bushels. The Saturday market prices are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September　49.875　Up 0.125</p>
<p>December　53.125　Up 0.250</p>
<p>May　58.250　Unchanged</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms Supplement Stock of Yellow and White Filature Silk</p>
<p>Overseas Silk Telegrams Awaiting Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firms' silk market did not see any actual sales. Overseas silk telegrams have yet to arrive in Shanghai for one or two days. Yesterday, only French firms supplemented their stock of yellow and white filature silk that were in short supply. Lillie, Baily, and Ankee purchased 30 bales of medium-grade B-grade Flying Boat, Snow Mountain, and Youth brand Shanghai white filature silk futures in 13-15 strand counts at prices of 595 to 620 taels. Dachang purchased 20 bales of medium-grade 13-15 strand count Lu yellow filature silk at a price of 585 taels.</p>
<p>Hangzhou's New Autumn Cocoons Awaiting Truck Transportation</p>
<p>Large Stockpiles of Cocoon Bales at Ganshanmen and Chang'an Stations</p>
<p>Hangzhou's cocoon season started early. Cocoon markets in Linping, Pingyao, Haining, Xiashi, Chang'an, and other places have all ended early. All firms have already dried their early autumn cocoons and are preparing for shipment. Late cocoons are still being dried. There are large stockpiles of the aforementioned autumn dried cocoons at Ganshanmen and Chang'an stations, with each having 500-600 bales. They are all awaiting truck transportation. It is reported that the railway bureau has allocated freight cars to go there, and a large batch of autumn cocoons is expected to be transported to Shanghai within the next few days.</p>
<p>婺北 Precious Eyebrow Tea Shows Activity</p>
<p>Yesterday, British firm Baochang of Yiyuan began to purchase 工色 Precious Eyebrow green tea from northern Wuyuan, seeing tea prices were favorable. They also issued a large number of telegrams, expecting the market for Precious Eyebrow tea in that region to expand. However, the opening market price was 20 taels lower, which local merchants were reluctantly selling at a loss. There were no large-scale transactions for goods from Tunxi, Shexian, and other regions. For 貢熙, the Russian firm Xie Xie Hui resumed operations yesterday and agreed to sell over 1,400 cases, with no change in the sales price. There were no large-scale transactions for needle-eyebrow or show-eyebrow tea.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Winter Wu Qing Brand Offerings Slightly Looser</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market maintained a firm trend as the exchange rate between the Dutch currency and silver did not fluctuate much. The 24th grade coarse grain white sugar offered by the Public Association remained at 14 liang 6 qian, with few transactions. Households purchased 20th grade medium grain white sugar at 14 liang, but no one sold it. Foreign firms were offering 14 liang 1 qian, but there were also no transactions. Among the merchants, Bingchang offered over 1,000 bags of Winter Wu Qing spot goods at a price of 9 liang 5 qian, slightly lower than before. In addition, the Chaozhou merchants offered over 500 bags of Longgang Qing at a price of 9 liang 2 qian and a half to 9 liang 2 qian, slightly lower by 1-2 qian compared to before. Also, the Jianbang merchants shipped over 400 bags of Gaozhuang Zhang Diao Qing from Jinan by boat yesterday, and samples have already been shown. The color and quality are both good, and it is expected that trading can begin today.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: First Batch of Quanzhou Dried Longans Arrives</p>
<p>Although this year is a bumper harvest for Quanzhou large bubble dried longans, there has been little rain during the ripening period, resulting in a scarcity of large-sized longans. The owners, aware of this, are collecting them in large quantities and waiting until after the White Dew season to process them, hoping that the fruits will grow larger. The first batch of goods was therefore delayed. Yesterday, the Changtai ship of Antai Company arrived from Quanzhou with the first batch of dried longans, totaling 1,283 pieces. It is feared that there will not be many top-quality longans. It is estimated that the first batch of Xinghua dried longans will leave the origin on the 28th of this month and arrive in Shanghai around the end of this month.</p>
<p>Metals: Pure Antimony Arrived Yesterday: 50 Tons</p>
<p>Recently, export merchants have been purchasing Hunan pure antimony, and transactions by foreign firms have also been making progress. The market has seen a turnaround, and the standard has risen from 185 taels to 200 taels. However, the inventory is extremely low, and market sentiment is good. 50 tons of spot goods arrived yesterday, and it is reported that half of them have already been purchased by a certain foreign firm at a price of 203 taels per ton.</p>

<h3>Chairman Lin Returned to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>National Government Chairman Lin, after coming to Shanghai from Lushan for medical treatment and visiting Wang Jingwei, was urged to return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over the central government. As Wang's illness worsened, he followed his doctor's advice to recuperate at Mogan Mountain and was unable to return to Nanjing for the time being. Chairman Lin, believing that the central government should not be vacant for long, took the 花车 train to Nanjing at 9:25 yesterday morning, accompanied by two staff members. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng and others went to the station to see him off.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ships in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Chinese Employees Laid Off</p>
<p>U.S. Government Settles the Unemployed</p>
<p>Instructs Shipping Companies to Comply</p>
<p>World Class Ships Have Already Implemented</p>
<p>The competition between Japan and the United States in the Pacific has been fierce in recent years, with each building new ships and competing for shipping rights. After the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, Sino-U.S. shipping felt even more that there were too many ships and too little cargo, resulting in an overcapacity of tonnage. Each time a ten-thousand-ton giant ship sailed, it carried only two or three hundred tons, and the freight revenue was not enough to cover fuel costs. The business of Japanese ships was even worse, carrying only ten or twenty tons. Now, due to the poor business conditions, U.S. ships are implementing austerity measures, and to settle unemployed workers, the Chinese employees on U.S. ships in the Pacific are being completely replaced by Americans. From now on, there will be no Chinese presence on U.S. ships. This matter is of great concern to the livelihood of the people, and the situation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Poor Business Conditions: The number of ships sailing in the Pacific from Shanghai is increasing daily, and more than ten special express ships have been added this year. To compete for Sino-U.S. cargo, the Japanese Osaka Company has also built ultra-fast ships such as the Donghai Maru and Nanhai Maru, which arrived in Shanghai for their maiden voyages yesterday. Due to the excessive number of Sino-U.S. ships, the export cargo feels even more scarce. In the recent months of July, August, and September, Sino-U.S. ships have only loaded one or two hundred tons of cargo each time, and Japanese ships have even less, carrying only six or seven tons per ship, which is a rare decline in recent years.</p>
<p>U.S. Merchants Austerity: To counter Japanese ships' competition, U.S. shipping companies are implementing austerity measures to achieve permanent confrontation. Everett Steamship Corporation, the largest shipping company on the Sino-U.S. route, has received a telegram from its head office stating that, starting this month, all employees of the company's land and sea departments, those with four or more employees, will have their salaries reduced by 15% to 85% to save money and make up for business losses.</p>
<p>Layoffs of Chinese Employees: All the stewards and seamen on U.S. ships in the Pacific are hired as Chinese, because they are hardworking and have low salaries. Now, as the number of unemployed workers in the United States is increasing daily, the U.S. government is urgently seeking a solution and has instructed all shipping companies to lay off all non-American employees on the ships and settle the unemployed workers of the United States in the vacancies. U.S. ships in the "World" class sailing to various places in China have already begun to implement this policy. The first group of Chinese to be dismissed were the Chinese stewards on the Everett World Ship "President Van Buren," numbering nearly a hundred, mostly Cantonese, who were dismissed ashore in Shanghai. The Chinese employees on six more ships will also be dismissed in batches, and all will be dismissed within three months.</p>
<p>Complete Replacement with Americans: After the dismissal of the Chinese employees on the seven "World" class ships, it is confirmed that the U.S. government has also ordered the shipowners of the U.S. ships on the Pacific routes, such as those to San Francisco and Seattle, to withdraw all Chinese employees and settle the unemployed Americans. This will continue to be implemented following the "World" class ships. From now on, there will be no foothold for Chinese to work on U.S. ships in the Pacific, and several thousand more unemployed will be added to the ranks of the unemployed in China's maritime industry.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Association Advocates</h3>
<p>Military Suppression of the Puppet State</p>
<p>Yesterday's Telegram to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan in Nanjing yesterday, which stated, "To the esteemed Nanjing Executive Yuan, at this critical time of the Manchurian Incident, we can only appeal to you to order troops to suppress the puppet state and recover lost territory, and to recall the ambassador to Japan to show your determination. We are unable to express our anxiety and await orders." - Shanghai Citizens' Association</p>
<h3>Aviation Construction Association</h3>
<p>Exhibition and Lecture Conference, Day 3</p>
<p>Aircraft to Drop Leaflets at 2 PM Today</p>
<p>The 19th was the third day of the Aviation Construction Association's propaganda exhibition. The number of visitors was extremely crowded. At 3 PM, Chairman Yin Zhiling introduced Liu Peiquan, General Manager of China Aviation, who lectured on "Commercial Aviation" and the three stages of the progress of the aviation industry: (1) The Experimental Period, from the first flight by American Wright in 1902 to the outbreak of the European War in 1914; (2) The Military Period, from 1915 to the end of the European War; (3) The Military and Commercial Development Period, from 1919 to the present. In these years, there has been rapid progress. As for commercial aviation, in the past 14 years, the total number of air routes in various countries around the world has reached 200,000 kilometers, with 3,500 airports and approximately 2,000 commercial aircraft. Last year alone, aircraft factories produced approximately 3,500 commercial aircraft. As for the state of commercial aviation in China, there are only over 1,800 kilometers of air routes, which is the Yangtze River line of China Aviation Corporation. The two companies have only 20 aircraft and no more than 30 pilots. There are plans to open the Shanghai-Tianjin-Guangdong lines, but they have not been achieved due to financial constraints. The government and the people provide little assistance, which has prevented full expansion. Governments in various countries provide subsidies for commercial aviation, such as the United States with 28 million gold dollars per year, the United Kingdom with 3.21 million yuan, France with 9.21 million yuan, Germany with 9.79 million gold dollars, and Canada with 4.96 million yuan. China</p>
<h3>Aviation Exhibition Photography (Li Zunyong Photo)</h3>
<p>The Aviation Expenditure allocated by the Ministry of Communications in the 11th year of the Republic was only 500,000 yuan. If we consider the average burden on the people, we Chinese people pay less than half a copper coin. As for the benefits of commercial aviation to the public, there are three points: (1) It facilitates transportation; (2) It saves time; (3) It trains talent and provides a national defense base. As China has such a vast territory and the borders are far apart, the use of aircraft is urgent and necessary. In the future, it is hoped that the government and the people will jointly resolve to support the aviation industry so that the flight business can progress. After Mr. Liu's lecture, the chairman introduced Ling Xianyang, who spoke on military aviation. He first mentioned the excessive shortage of aircraft in China, such as the Central Government having only seven teams, each with approximately ten aircraft, and Guangdong having only forty or fifty aircraft. The Northeast had more than 100 aircraft, of which forty or fifty could be used for military purposes. The rest were ineffective because there were no qualified repair engineers. As for the use of aircraft in the military, the first time in China was during the war between the Central Government and Feng Yuxiang, which was very effective. Later, they were used to deal with the Communists. Aircraft bombing immediately disrupted the Red Army's line. However, while it can still be useful domestically, it is far behind in terms of formal foreign relations. Military aircraft must be connected to wireless communication so that they can report to headquarters anytime, anywhere, and troops can advance or retreat at any time. During the January 28th Incident, the Japanese were completely superior in the air. They first bombed the railway station and then used reconnaissance photography to identify our positions, so that Japanese artillery and bombs could accurately hit the targets. The Battle of Dachang was a clear example of this. When Japanese aircraft bombed Baoshan Road, they came with five bombers, but there were no protective aircraft in between. If China had one or two fighter planes at the time, none of the five bombers would have survived. It is a pity. Recently, storms are gathering between Japan and the United States in the Pacific. If a war breaks out in the future, aircraft will be the focus of the war. Japan currently has more than 3,000 aircraft, of which 1,000 can be used for combat, and more than 9,000 pilots. The United States has more than 10,000 aircraft, of which 3,000 can be used for combat, and more than 14,000 pilots, all of whom are very experienced. The performance of Japanese aircraft in the previous year, using 340 aircraft, from Tokyo to Korea, resulted in 26 accidents. The United States, using 600 aircraft, from Chicago to Washington, D.C., traveled over 2,000 li without any accidents. This is because the repair and maintenance engineering is more detailed than in other countries. Recently, a Japanese military officer inadvertently leaked information that if a war breaks out between Japan and the United States, 300 Japanese aircraft will be fully loaded with bombs and, if they encounter a U.S. warship or aircraft carrier, the entire aircraft will directly attack the U.S. warship, causing it to shatter and break, and the pilot is willing to sacrifice. However, U.S. warships will never allow Japanese to get so close as to cause problems. Warships can emit mist to make aircraft lose their bearings, and U.S. fighter planes can preemptively strike, and Japanese aircraft will be destroyed. Recently, the United States has manufactured the world's largest airship, which can ascend very high and store five aircraft inside, with six radio stations. Upon seeing enemy aircraft, they can fly out to meet the enemy. In addition, with high-altitude guns and artillery, they are incomparably sharp. Japan's strength is far behind. In short, China must promote all aspects of the country. Among them, building aviation is the most important. It is hoped that the public will promote each other and do their best to ensure that the military air force is established as soon as possible. Otherwise, the remains of Zhabei can be found everywhere. After Mr. Ling's lecture, the chairman introduced Mr. Zhang Wenzu, who recently returned from France, to speak on "Anti-Aircraft Guns." Roughly speaking, anti-aircraft guns are an aviation armament problem and can also be regarded as air defense. In our country, where aviation is not developed, air defense is particularly important. During the European War, anti-aircraft guns were a powerful weapon for protecting positions. Its own capabilities are three: (1) Organization, (2) Equipment, (3) Technology. Organization includes the breadth of the position and the number of people in the battle, for example, if our army has a 25-mile position, the air defense team should occupy a 10-mile position and be equipped with four light guns with a firing height of 4,500 meters and six automatic guns. The equipment should be light and heavy, including various automatic guns, listening devices, telephones, and searchlights. Team members should be agile in their skills and calm in their attitude, and cooperate with the gun teams in the same position. The explanation was very detailed. Due to time constraints, it is difficult to say more. Everyone, we are in a time of national defense void today. In the event of an emergency, anti-aircraft gun air defense can also be effective. Today, I will give a brief introduction to everyone, and I hope you will understand. The association's exhibition and lecture conference closed last night. Membership recruitment begins today, and the China Aviation Corporation will drop leaflets printed by the association to promote aviation construction in the sky at 2 PM.</p>

<h3>Zeng Zhongming Halts Trip to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Returning to Beijing Today</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after Zeng Zhongming arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the night before last, he originally intended to go to Moganshan to visit Wang Jingwei, a member of the Central Standing Committee. However, Madam Chen Bijun, Wang's wife, also returned to Shanghai from Moganshan with Chu Minyi the night before last. Zeng then visited Wang's residence yesterday to meet Madam Wang and inquire about Wang's condition. According to Madam Wang, Wang's illness has not subsided at all, and the doctor has advised against seeing guests. Regarding the issue of a member of the Central Political Council (CPC) acting as an agent, Wang still hopes that a committee member will be appointed to act on his behalf, and hopes that the CPC will hold regular meetings instead of just holding talks, so as to avoid stagnation in government affairs. Since Wang is recuperating in the mountains and absolutely cannot see guests, Zeng has cancelled his trip to Moganshan and will return to Beijing today.</p>
<h3>Remarks by Mr. Chu Minyi</h3>
<p>Chen Bijun Welcomes Her Mother's Arrival</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Currently Recuperating in Moganshan</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Ms. Chen Bijun, a member of the Central Committee, personally escorted her husband, Mr. Wang Jingwei, to Moganshan for recuperation due to his illness. It is now known that Chen Bijun arrived in Shanghai the night before last with Chu Minyi. Reporters visited to inquire about Wang's condition. According to Chu, Mr. Wang is currently recuperating in Moganshan, and because doctors have forbidden him from seeing guests, even Chairman Lu (Dipin) of Zhejiang Province and Director Lu (Bichou) of the Civil Affairs Department have not visited him. Chu himself returned to Shanghai first because of the opening of the Sino-French Industrial College and the Pharmaceutical Training School and will take tonight's (yesterday's) train to Beijing. Madam Wang returned to Shanghai to welcome her mother, who came from Hong Kong to visit Wang due to his illness.</p>

Let us make September 18th Commoner's Day, and on this day, compatriots should engage in a large-scale commoner's movement. National rejuvenation will then have a solid foundation. China Commoner's Friendship Society, Geng.</p>
<h3>Land Tax to be Levied Next Year</h3>
<p>Collection Outline Submitted to the Municipal Government for Review by the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The municipal government's revenue was previously short by three million yuan. Therefore, there was a proposal to reorganize old taxes in order to make up for the shortfall. Among these old taxes, the land tax is the largest, with an annual income of approximately six million yuan. However, due to the different grades of land, and the fact that the grain tax is calculated in either silver taels or silver dollars, there were often inconveniences. In addition, there were also so-called surcharges, which had numerous titles during the warlord era. After the establishment of the municipal government, although they were uniformly renamed "Municipal Government Surcharges," the collection was still fraught with difficulties. After the implementation of the land tax, not only will the names be unified, but the collection will also be more convenient. It is reported that the Land and Finance Bureaus have already agreed on the outline for the collection of the land tax and submitted it to the mayor for referral to the Ministry of Finance for review and promulgation. However, the date of implementation will be next year.</p>
<h3>Area Around Langshan Mountain in Tongzhou</h3>
<p>Concerns About Silting of the Yangtze River Channel</p>
<p>The Hydrographic Office to Discuss Solutions Today</p>
<p>The Yangtze River in the area around Langshan Mountain in Tongzhou, because it is located in the lower reaches of the river and the river surface is wide, has a relatively slow water flow, making it easy for sand and soil to settle. As a result, the channel changes from time to time, causing various difficulties for navigation. In recent days, the silting has become even more severe, raising the riverbed and causing the banks to be eroded by waves, posing a risk of danger. The Hydrographic Office of the Ministry of Navy, in view of this situation, is deeply concerned that once the banks collapse, the lives and property of the people in the Tongzhou Langshan area will be unimaginable. Therefore, it recently submitted a request to the Ministry of Navy to jointly consult with relevant agencies to discuss solutions. Yesterday, it received Instruction No. 5789 from the Ministry of Navy, approving the proposed action. Therefore, the bureau has scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM today at the bureau to convene representatives from relevant agencies and experts to discuss solutions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Document Submitted to the Ministry of the Navy: Wu Guangzong, Director of the Hydrographic Office, submits a document to the Ministry of the Navy stating that the Yangtze River channel around Langshan Mountain in Tongzhou is changing rapidly, posing a danger. It is proposed to consult with relevant agencies to determine solutions and request review and approval. Having examined the matter, it is found that the Yangtze River channel around Langshan Mountain in Tongzhou is undergoing drastic changes, posing a danger. This bureau reported to the Ministry in January of last year, and received instructions to consult with the Construction Committee and submit a request to the National Government for review and action. As a result, Technical Director Mi Lusi was dispatched, along with Chen Maojie, a member of the Construction Committee, Song Xishang, Director of the Engineering Department of the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Committee, and a foreign employee named Storey, to conduct a survey. After the survey was completed, a report was prepared and submitted in June of last year. Subsequently, in July, a joint request was made with Chen Maojie and Song Xishang to appoint specialists to prepare an improvement plan and a fundraising and implementation plan to facilitate progress. Instructions were also received from the Ministry to dispatch the director of this bureau to consult and handle the matter as necessary. Having examined the matter, since January of last year to the present, this bureau has repeatedly dispatched ships to resurvey the waterway due to its significant importance to shipping routes. It is deeply aware that the situation in the area is changing rapidly. If various measures to protect against collapse and protect the banks are not implemented in a timely manner, it is feared that the damage will be irreversible. Once a breach occurs, the lives and property of the people in the Tongzhou area will be unimaginable. It is proposed to consult with Chen Maojie, Song Xishang, and others within the next few days to discuss implementation measures and then submit a report for review and action to facilitate implementation. It is proper to submit a document requesting review and approval for public benefit. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Meeting Today: After receiving Instruction No. 5789 from the Ministry of the Navy yesterday, approving the proposed action, Wu Guangzong, Director of the Hydrographic Office, immediately scheduled a meeting for 2:00 PM today to convene Technical Director Mi Lusi of the Construction Committee, Member Chen Maojie, Song Xishang, Director of the Engineering Department of the Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Committee, foreign employee Storey, and Section Chief Gu Shishi, and others to discuss implementation measures. However, it is felt that the large amount of funding required to address the expenses issue presents a significant difficulty.</p>
<h3>Country of Origin Mark on Imported Goods</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Agrees in Principle</p>
<p>To Be Specified in the Customs Law</p>
<p>The China International Trade Association previously requested the Ministry of Industry to suggest to the Ministry of Finance that specific rules be established requiring that imported goods be clearly marked with the name of the original factory and place of origin in conspicuous locations on the packaging, to be strictly enforced by customs. The association has now received Notification No. 13605 from the Ministry of Industry, stating that after the situation was reported to the Ministry of Finance for review and action, the Ministry of Finance replied that various countries' methods of using country-of-origin markings on imported goods can indeed prevent ambiguity and other malpractices. The Ministry is currently drafting a customs law and intends to include the above-mentioned country-of-origin marking method in the law for review and implementation to facilitate enforcement.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Ministry of Finance Borrowing Money from the Money Trade</h3>
<p>The Origin of the News Reported from Nanjing</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that yesterday, various newspapers in the city published a Nanjing dispatch stating that due to the Ministry of Finance's financial exhaustion, it was borrowing four million yuan from the Shanghai money trade to implement the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan. A reporter received news from certain sources yesterday that since the September 18th Incident last year, the Ministry of Finance, although repaying the principal of various bonds on schedule, has suffered a severe drop in bond prices due to the instability of the situation. In addition, the loss of tax revenue from the Northeast has caused the central government's finances to be extremely depleted for the past year. This summer, in order to reorganize the national currency system and unify it, a decision was made to re-implement the abolition of the tael. The money trade, which has been using taels and yuan for a long time, believes that the sudden implementation would not be a blessing for the people or the financial community. The Shanghai money trade has submitted opinions twice, requesting the financial authorities to adopt them. For several months, people across the country have been paying close attention to this matter. Before the Ministry of Finance established a research association on the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen had repeatedly invited leaders from the silver and money trades in the city to discuss the matter, expressing the hope that the silver and money trades would provide assistance to the Ministry of Finance. The paper currency tax that was implemented a month ago was reluctantly collected by the banking community as a last resort. It is heard that although the Ministry of Finance intends to borrow money from the money trade, the amount is definitely not as high as four million yuan. According to a certain important figure in the money trade, borrowing money and the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan cannot be confused as one issue. However, if the central government's finances are improved, there may be a slight delay in the implementation of the abolition of the tael.</p>

<h3>Jiangning Fellow-Provincials Association</h3>
<p>Appeals for Farmers Whose Land Was Requisitioned</p>
<p>The Jiangning Six Counties Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai sends a telegram to the Central Executive Committee, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission: On September 11th, a letter from Shanghai merchant Tang Jiayi and others stated that in the spring, the Ministry of Military Affairs requisitioned the first phase of civilian land in the Third and Fifth Districts of Jiangning County to build a artillery school shooting range, covering an area of over 90,000 mu (approximately 15,000 acres), including over 70 villages, several thousand households, and over 50,000 people. Due to the urgent deadline for the requisition, they were in a state of panic. Representatives Zhang Kaixuan and others, elected by the people of 73 villages, repeatedly petitioned various agencies of the government, requesting a change in the plan, but to no avail. However, on June 3rd, a directive was received from the Central Standing Committee stating, "The case has been transferred to the Military Affairs Commission for review, stating that the construction of the artillery shooting range is related to national military facilities and is extremely important, and should not be easily changed. However, considering that the number of people to be relocated reaches thousands of households, it is extremely pitiful. It should be approved to requisition the most important parts first, provide generous compensation to allow them to relocate, and then proceed with the rest gradually, to show compassion." This demonstrates a comprehensive consideration of both national interests and people's livelihoods. Yesterday, it was read in the newspaper that representatives Zhang Kaixuan and others had prostrated themselves before the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan three times to petition, but permission was still not granted. Jiayi and others are merchants who are away from home, but their families still live in their hometown. Once the land is requisitioned, their fields and ancestral graves will all be included. It has been found that since the land was enclosed in the spring, the people have been panicking. In addition, since the summer, there has been no rain for over a month, the mountain streams and ponds have dried up, and the seedlings have withered, creating a disaster. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and there is no way to borrow money. In effect, the livelihood of tens of thousands of people has been cut off. The pain is deeply felt, and we dare not remain silent. Now, for the sake of the people's livelihood and the homeless, we are compelled to beseech your esteemed committee to send a concise telegram to request the authorities to consider the unemployment of tens of thousands of people, to request a change in the plan so that the people in the district can feel secure in farming, which would benefit both the national economy and the people's livelihood. This would be greatly appreciated. The association has found that the Third and Fifth Districts of Jiangning have many fields and a dense population, and those who live there are all natives who rely solely on farming for their livelihood. They live and eat there. Now, if they are relocated in one day, not only will they be displaced, but also they will lose their land, resulting in losses that cannot be calculated in both tangible and intangible terms. As Shanghai merchants Tang Jiayi and others have stated the situation, we dare to represent the people's will and submit our petition. We humbly beseech your esteemed government and yuan to consider that the two districts have a large number of villages and households and are not suitable for use as an artillery school and shooting range. Order the Ministry of Military Affairs to change the plan and find another open area for requisition and construction to relieve the people's suffering and show benevolence. We await your instructions with utmost anticipation. The Jiangning Six Counties Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai bows in respect.</p>
<h3>U.S. Marines Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reinforcements for U.S. Troops Departing Continuously</p>
<p>A battalion of reinforcements from the U.S. Marine Corps, dispatched from Manila, totaling 350 men and 15 officers, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning aboard the transport ship Chaumont. They entered the Huangpu River at around 10:00 AM and will be stationed in the new barracks on Chengdu Road and Jing'an Temple Road. The majority of these marines are reinforcements for the U.S. troops who have been departing Shanghai continuously, and their deployment period is two and a half years.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that after this increase, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai has reached 2,000 men. Therefore, it is heard that the defense zones of the various countries' troops in the International Settlement will also be slightly changed, expanding the U.S. troop defense zone to include the area jointly defended by the U.S. Army and British troops during the Shanghai War.</p>
<h3>Japanese Xinzeng Store</h3>
<p>Bomb Explodes Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a young man walked into the Japanese Xinzeng Cotton Cloth and General Merchandise Store at Nos. 114-116 Jixiang Street, Avenue Edward VII, first throwing in a letter and then throwing a bomb. With a loud bang, the bomb exploded, and thick smoke filled the air. The fire was quickly extinguished, and fortunately, no one was injured. After the incident, the letter was opened, and it was learned that it was a warning from the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Repeated Warnings: The store has been open for over 20 years and has a thriving business. The goods sold are mainly Japanese products, with cotton yarn and cloth accounting for a relatively smaller proportion. After the Shanghai Incident, the Cotton Cloth Industry Association issued several warnings, ordering it to stop selling Japanese goods. After the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps in Shanghai discovered this, it also repeatedly warned the store, advising it to stop selling quickly. It has sent over a dozen letters, the first of which was on August 8th, signed by the Shanghai Self-Sacrifice Assassination Corps, with extremely stern words.</p>
<p>Bomb Explosion: At around 11:00 AM yesterday, a young man suddenly walked in, first throwing in a letter, then shouting at the store clerks to leave quickly, and then violently throwing a bomb inside. With a loud bang, it exploded immediately. The kitchen window caught fire at the time, and thick smoke filled the air. The fire was later extinguished by the store clerks. The bomber, seeing that his purpose had been achieved, calmly left. For a time, the spectators were as numerous as a mountain and a sea.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Traffic Interrupted: After the incident, the store opened the letter and found that it was a warning from the Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps. The letter said, "Warning to the owner of the Japanese Xinzeng store: It has been found that you have been privately importing large quantities of Japanese goods. A bomb has been thrown as an initial warning. You are now given 24 hours from the receipt of this letter to promptly and publicly burn the newly imported enemy goods and declare your repentance in major newspapers. If you do not comply, this corps is determined to bomb you to death in the shortest possible time. No matter where you hide, you will not be able to escape the bombing range of this corps. This is a special warning. Issued by the Shanghai Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps, September 19, 1932." After reading the letter, the store handed over the original letter from the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps and the remnants of the bomb casing to the detectives and the police station for filing.</p>
<p>Post-Incident Statement: After the incident, a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency went to the store to investigate. The clerks all said that the manager was out. Later, Mr. Fang from the store came out and said, "Since the September 18th Incident last year, this store has automatically sealed up all Japanese goods, the value of which is over 100,000 yuan, and has never opened them for sale. Later, after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, business was extremely depressed and had reached a critical point. We had no choice but to reluctantly open the stored old goods for sale to relieve the urgent situation. Unexpectedly, this was discovered by patriotic organizations such as the Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps, who sent over a dozen warning letters, mostly misunderstanding that the Japanese goods sold by this store were newly imported. However, this store has a conscience, and with the national crisis so serious, how dare we import Japanese goods again? Therefore, knowing that the goods we were selling were old stock, we did not need to make a statement and continued to sell them as usual. Who knew that they would not understand the situation and would take such drastic measures today, throwing a bomb as a warning? They were driven by patriotism to take this action, but this store has a clear conscience. Therefore, we have drafted a statement explaining the situation, apologizing to the corps in the newspaper, and declaring that we will never import Japanese goods again, and will stop selling and seal up those that have already been opened for sale to fulfill their wishes."</p>

<h3>Resolving the Labor Dispute at Qiuxin Shipyard</h3>
<p>Four Resolutions Determined</p>
<p>Union Announces Resumption of Work Today</p>
<p>Due to the dismissal of workers at the Qiuxin Shipyard, a strike occurred. Yesterday, through the earnest mediation of party and government organizations with both sides, resolutions have been determined, and work is scheduled to resume this morning. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Party and Government Mediation: Yesterday, Wang Bing, director of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, along with Zhou Lianze, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, negotiated with the shipyard at 10:00 AM. Mr. McTilloone initially stated he was not responsible, but after stern questioning by the Social Affairs Bureau representative, four principles for resolution were determined. However, he stated that it was necessary to consult with the head office once. Later, the party and government representatives, along with the shipyard representatives, negotiated with the head office manager and then consulted with the labor union. The labor union immediately convened a general membership meeting for discussion. At that time, all workers expressed that they would not resume work until their demands were met. After earnest persuasion by the party and government representatives, they finally agreed, it is said.</p>
<p>Resolutions: (1) Worker No. 821 is permitted to terminate his employment relationship with the employer, but the shipyard acknowledges payment of a severance fee of 90 yuan. (2) Wages for the strike period will be paid to workers in the iron window department for five days each, and to workers in other departments for four days each. (3) All workers are permitted to resume work on the morning of the 20th of this month. (4) The previously agreed labor-management agreement must be observed by both parties and must not be violated.</p>
<p>Announcement of Work Resumption: The labor union, after accepting the advice of the party and government, decided to resume work with pain. The original text of the announcement is recorded below as a matter of notification: This dispute has been earnestly mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau, and four resolutions have been determined. In this situation, we have no choice but to accept the advice of the superiors and resume work as usual on the morning of September 20th. All are expected to comply and not be mistaken. This is a special notice.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Company</h3>
<p>New Workers Launch Labor Strike</p>
<p>Protest Against Russian Ticket Inspectors Assaulting Workers</p>
<p>Company Rejects Five Demands</p>
<p>Dagongshe reports that after a strike by previous ticket sellers at the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, the company hired more than 300 new workers to maintain operations. Recently, due to white Russian ticket inspectors using whips to assault workers and firing them, public outrage has erupted, and the situation is very serious. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Labor Strike: These new workers have been serving for two months. When the company hired them, it stated that their wages would be increased slightly compared to the old workers (the original wage was 23 yuan per month). Unexpectedly, when wages were paid the other day, they were still paid at the original rate, and the workers expressed dissatisfaction. Recently, the company has increased pressure. Ticket seller No. 114 was beaten by a Japanese person. When he negotiated with the company, not only was he ignored, but he was also fired, causing public outrage and a serious backlash.</p>
<p>Workers' Congress: More than 300 workers held a congress at 6:00 AM yesterday in the company's vacant lot on Connaught Road to discuss how to respond. Five demands were put forward: (1) Increase wages to 40 yuan and restore the old copper coin bonus system. (2) Oppose the dismissal of workers and reinstate the dismissed worker. (3) Reduce working hours and implement a three-shift system. (4) Abolish white Russian ticket inspectors. (5) Improve treatment, including (A) opposing the removal of shift leaders, (B) opposing beating and scolding workers, (C) opposing the tipping of leather bags, and (D) opposing punishing workers based on false accusations. Fifteen representatives were temporarily elected, including Nos. 256, 13, 132, 75, 246, 232, 254, 152, 151, 19, 71, 109, and 42, to be responsible for negotiating with the company. All workers waited quietly for news and then decided on a course of action. At that time, the 6th District Public Security Bureau heard the news and, fearing unexpected incidents, the District Chief Tan personally led police officers to maintain order. He persuaded the workers to board the buses first and serve as usual to avoid disrupting traffic. Regarding the conditions, he instructed the elected representatives to go to the company with him to negotiate. The workers complied and then announced the adjournment of the meeting.</p>
<p>Negotiation Situation: District Chief Tan, together with the fifteen worker representatives, went to the company at 9:00 AM yesterday to negotiate with factory director Short, deputy general manager Strong, and Pia, requesting a response to the conditions put forward by the workers to avoid escalating the dispute. Short and others received them and promised to reply after asking the general manager. The representatives then withdrew.</p>
<p>Company Response: The British-owned China General Omnibus Company formally replied yesterday afternoon after receiving the workers' demands, saying: "In response to the matter, the conditions put forward by the ticket sellers have not restored the original situation in the company, and revenue is insufficient. Even before the ticket sellers have served a full month, although an increase in salary cannot be made at this time, it will be considered after further consideration, but only after the environment is deemed appropriate. However, it is hoped that in the next few weeks, with the improvement in the situation of the ticket sellers, a good result can be achieved in terms of bonuses, or at the latest by the end of October. After the company's economic strength is sufficient, it will do its best to enable employees to receive a salary increase within a reasonable range. It should be known that the company authorities believe that the comfort felt by the employees themselves is more important than everything else." General Manager An Jue.</p>

<p>Social Affairs Bureau Section Chief Xu Personally Persuades Workers to Resume Eating</p>
<p>Court Sets Trial for Appeal Case on the 21st</p>
<p>Dagongshe reports that Hong Jiaben and 33 other workers from the main factory of the Sanyou Industrial Company, angered by the employer's violation of the arbitration decision and suspension of food supply, staged a second hunger strike. Xu Yefu, section chief of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, personally went to the hospital yesterday to persuade them to eat. Members of the General Labor Union took the night express train to Beijing last night to petition. The court has scheduled the trial for the 21st at 2:00 PM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Persuading to Resume Eating: Xu Yefu, section chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, considered that the hunger-striking workers of the Sanyou Factory had not been eating for long and then suddenly started a second hunger strike, which would have a great impact on their lifelong health or even cause a life-threatening situation. Therefore, at 11:00 AM yesterday, he personally went to the Shanghai Hospital and Labor Hospital with Xia Yuzhao, director of the cotton weaving industry labor affairs in the 7th District, and Shao Xubai, representative of the Municipal General Labor Union, to persuade the workers to resume eating. He said, "The Sanyou Factory incident is no longer a matter of the company's attitude toward the workers, but a matter of the employer resisting government orders. Therefore, the workers' hunger strike will not be able to move them, and even if they sacrifice, it will be meaningless. In short, the government has determined a method of handling this incident to maintain its credibility and will do its best to seek a solution. The food supply for the workers will especially be addressed. I hope that all workers will resume eating today." His words were very sincere. At the same time, Shao Xubai, representative of the General Labor Union, also gave individual advice. The hunger-striking workers expressed their acceptance, but hoped that the government and all parties would do their best to handle the matter. Immediately, nurses from the hospital gave them milk and rice soup one after another. Therefore, from yesterday afternoon, they all declared the resumption of eating.</p>
<p>Municipal Assembly Resolution: The cotton weaving industry labor union in the 7th District yesterday morning again dispatched Qin Haiyan, Leng Shimo, Chen Xinzhi, Zhu Hongmou, Yin Dasheng, Zhou Zhenqiu, Zhou Xueli, Qin Changgeng, Wu Renfu, Zhang Tingliang, and ten others to petition the 8th Representative Congress of the city. They were received by Lu Jingshi, who replied that the Sanyou dispute had been submitted to the congress for discussion. It was resolved to urge the municipal government to enforce the arbitration decision and to ask the People's Livelihood Training Section to send personnel to comfort the hunger-striking workers. Please inform all workers to wait quietly for a resolution. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>
<p>Trial to Open Tomorrow: After the municipal government's arbitration decision, because the employer declared dissatisfaction, it appealed to the Shanghai Local Court. After the court approved the request, it set the trial for 1:00 PM tomorrow and yesterday issued summonses, notifying both parties to appear in court on time. It is heard that a certain lawyer has generously agreed to appear in court on behalf of the labor side on a pro bono basis and present everything.</p>
<p>General Committee Petitions in Beijing: The Municipal General Labor Union believes that the employer of Sanyou has suspended the food supply, and the workers are about to run out of food, and the situation is extremely serious. Therefore, members of the union Zhou Xuexiang and Shao Xubai took the 11:00 PM night express train to Beijing last night to petition various ministries and courts of the central government, requesting emergency measures. [P Chinese Economic Society Members</p>
<p>Depart for Jinhua this Morning for Investigation</p>
<p>Commemorate National Humiliation on 9/18 at East Tianmu Mountain</p>
<p>Elect Officers and Decide Location of Next Annual Meeting</p>
<p>All members of the Ninth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society departed for East Tianmu Mountain on 9/18 for investigation, held a National Humiliation Commemoration that evening at a mountain temple, and held a society affairs meeting to elect officers and decide the location of the next annual meeting. Details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Commemorating National Humiliation: All members and journalists fasted once on 9/18 during the trip to investigate East Tianmu Mountain to express their grief. At the same time, when stopping along the way, they gathered the villagers and described the course of the national humiliation in detail, as well as how Chinese people should love and save the country. Their words were extremely painful and moved everyone who heard them. After arriving at East Tianmu Mountain that evening, they held a National Humiliation Conference, chaired by Shou Yicheng, who reported the purpose of the meeting. Member Xu Jieling gave a speech, revealing "The Economic Isolation Process of Zhejiang Province." In addition, Wang Yunwu, He Dekui, and others also gave very long speeches. The main ideas were that all people in all sectors should stick to their duties, and if everyone can fulfill their duties, they can cope with the national crisis. During the European war, a Swiss girl on a mountain train had a U.S. woman accidentally tear her ticket into pieces. The ticket inspector found it, and even though passengers testified, the ticket inspector still put the torn ticket together and punched a hole in it. When someone asked why, he said, "This is to fulfill my duty." His devotion to duty was such that he was truly a model for us. Finally, Wang Yunwu reported on the burning of the Commercial Press and the situation of its resurgence and concluded.</p>
<p>Society Affairs Meeting: A society affairs meeting was then convened, with Li Quanshi as chairman, to discuss amending the society's constitution, and it was resolved that the secretariat would review it. The election of directors then began. As a result, Ma Yinchu, Liu Dajun, Zhang Gongquan, Jia Shiyi, Wu Daquan, He Dekui, Li Quanshi, Dai Ailu, and Li Zhaohuan were elected as directors. Shou Yicheng, Liu Binglin, Chen Changheng, Wei Tingsheng, and Jin Guobao were alternate directors. Pan Xulun, Li Fuxun, Xu Jiqing, and others were elected as fund custody committee members, and Liu Hongsheng and Mu Ouchu were alternate members. Regarding the location of the next annual meeting, after discussion, it was decided to temporarily select from Jinan, Beiping, and Xu Gongqiao in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Investigating Jinhua: On the evening of 9/18, all members and new journalists stayed at the East Tianmu Mountain Temple. They departed yesterday morning to investigate West Tianmu Mountain and returned to Hangzhou in the afternoon. At 8:00 AM this morning, they gathered at the West Lake Hotel and departed to visit the Hangzhou Power Plant's new Zhakou factory and had breakfast at the power plant. At 9:00 AM, they gathered at the Jiangbian Station and departed by the Hangjiang Railway to investigate Jinhua. At noon, the Hangzhou Power Plant and the Hangjiang Railway jointly held a public banquet in the car. A public lecture was given in the evening, and a lecture platform was set up at the Zhejiang Provincial Seventh Middle School, with lectures预由 scheduled by Ma Yinchu, Liu Zhanen, Li Quanshi, and others.

<h3>Wenchang Salt Affairs Improvement Association</h3>
<p>Advocates for Liquidation of Merchants' Excessive Collections</p>
<p>The Wenzhou-Chuzhou Salt Affairs Improvement Association in this city sent a telegram to the two prefectures, saying: "To the party headquarters, chambers of commerce, legal entities, fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, and sisters in all counties of Wenzhou and Chuzhou, may you all be informed: Ever since the Wenzhou-Chuzhou salt affairs were changed to merchant contracting, officials and merchants colluded, and engaged in corruption and embezzlement, harming the country and the people, relying on the strong to bully the weak. For four years, the people have suffered without appeal. This association is pained by the collusion between officials and merchants, and the national crisis. United comrades speak out to improve the situation. With a rallying cry, the distant and near respond. The salt affairs improvement associations of Yongjia, Longquan, and other counties have been established successively, with one heart and one mind, striving and planning. The list of crimes was presented to the court and ministries, evidence was collected, lawsuits were filed in court, the inside story was revealed, and their conspiracies were broken. The minister was perceptive and ordered the abolition, in order to make them realize their errors and not to protect them again. The inspection hall and court investigated and pursued them strictly. Why were the official governments deaf and blind in the past, but now they enforce justice? It is all due to the people of our two prefectures calling out and urging them. (Omitted middle section) Recently, although the merchants have been abolished, the excessive collections have not been repaid. In name it is free trade, but in reality the remnants of the old system still exist. This is a matter of concern for all of us in the two prefectures, not just a few people's gains and losses. If our fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, and sisters in the two prefectures are willing to give up their civil rights and submit to the control of treacherous officials, then so be it. If not, they should quickly rise up, gather comrades, elect representatives, go to the Wenzhou-Chuzhou salt affairs government office, organize a committee to liquidate the merchants' taxes and excessive collections, and report to the government to avoid concealment. The people of our two prefectures have suffered from the merchants' trampling for a long time. Now, fortunately, the Ministry of Finance is rectifying salt affairs and reforming them greatly. Commissioner Feng is honest and perceptive and vowed to eliminate accumulated abuses. This is a good opportunity to improve the salt affairs of our two prefectures. All of our fathers, elders, brothers, sisters, aunts, and sisters should quickly unite, expose treachery, suggest to the government, and be their backup force to help them implement the changes. Do not make mistakes and give up on yourselves and let others slaughter you. It is fortunate, fortunate! The Wenzhou-Chuzhou Salt Affairs Improvement Association bows and respectfully requests."

<h3>Brave Chinese Police Persist in Chasing Thieves</h3>
<p>French Concession Chinese Police Assist in Apprehending</p>
<p>At 11:20 AM yesterday (the 19th), police officers Jiang Haiting, No. 1450, and Wang Fengzhu, No. 1789, from the First Precinct of the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, were on duty at the intersection of Min Guo Road, west of the new North Gate, when they suddenly saw a man chasing a man wearing a white cloth short shirt and trousers and carrying a package. The man shouted, "Catch the robber!" The police officers joined in the chase. The robber fled from Min Guo Road into Xingsheng Street in the French Concession and reached the Avenue Edward VII. The police officers pursued closely and blew their whistles. A Chinese police officer No. 105 from the French Police Station on duty at the entrance of Avenue Edward VII heard the alarm, saw the robber fleeing, stepped forward and grabbed him. He then took him to the Great Bell Police Station together with the police officers. After questioning the robber, the detective learned that he had robbed pedestrians in the Chinese area. He approved the handover of the robber and the stolen goods to the two police officers Jiang and Wang and dispatched police officers to escort them to the First Precinct of the Second District in the Chinese area for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Tonghua Steamer Leaves the Shallows and Opens to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tonghua steamer, which ran aground at Huangsangkou in Qizhou, was worked on by the company's Lijii, Tunan, Jiangshun, and other steamers for eight days without success after the accident on the 10th. It was not until 7:00 AM on the 18th that the company dispatched the Jiangxin and Jianghua steamers to exert themselves to tow it out of the shallows during the rising tide. Yesterday, the shipping department telegraphed the steamer to return to Shanghai and is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. Whether it is damaged still needs to be verified after arriving in Shanghai before deciding whether to repair it.</p>
<h3>Two Steamers Collide and Cause Disaster</h3>
<p>Thirteen-Year-Old Boy Drowns</p>
<p>Sun Jinkui's Left Foot Crushed</p>
<p>The Jutai ferry, which operates between Zhangjiangzhen in Pudong and Weijiadu in the South City, was traveling from Zhangzhen to Shanghai at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday when it arrived near Yanjiaqiao in Bailianjing Port. At that time, the Chuansha class Minli ferry was traveling from the Guanqiao Pier in the South City, carrying passengers to Bailianjing Port to go to Chuansha. The two ferries met at that location, and failing to give way, they collided violently. A thirteen-year-old boy, a passenger, lost his footing and was knocked into the port, where he tragically drowned and sank out of sight. A passenger named Sun Jinkui (39 years old) also had his left foot crushed by the two ferries, which was a terrible sight. After the disaster, the two ferries returned to Shanghai together and first sent the injured Sun Jinkui to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, the captains of the two ferries surrendered themselves to the water patrol team, who transferred them to the court yesterday for disposal.</p>
<h3>Prelude to Rent Reduction in Changchunfang</h3>
<p>Four Months Rent-Free...30% Rent Reduction</p>
<p>Tao Wuzhi, a lawyer and rental agent for the Sanxin Company, the owner of dozens of city houses in Changchunfang on Donghongjiang Road in Hongkou, in view of the situation after the Shanghai war, voluntarily waived four months' rent and reduced the rent by 30% of the original rent from July 1st to the end of December 1933, to show sympathy. The tenants were all relieved and deeply grateful for Lawyer Tao's understanding.</p>
<h3>Laotianxiang Lane</h3>
<p>Tenants Oppose Demolition and File Lawsuit</p>
<p>The male landlord, Zhongfa Real Estate Trust Company, of Laotianxiang Lane on Beiler Road in the French Concession, suddenly issued a notice in January of this year, stating that the houses would be demolished soon and requesting all tenants to move out quickly. The tenants elected representatives and asked Lawyer Yu Hualong to publish an objection to the demolition in the newspaper. After the representatives pleaded with the landlord several times, they considered the current national crisis and withdrew the order, and the matter was suspended. After several months, the landlord suddenly posted a notice again, stating that the fences would be built on the 20th of this month. The tenants were indignant, but Ms. Wu Fangshi, Ms. Huang Wushi, Ms. Liu Huizhen, and others had paid small rents of 500 yuan or 300 yuan when they moved into the houses in the lane years ago, stating that they could live there for more than five years. It has only been more than two years now. Not only did the landlord violate the contract, but he also ignored the livelihoods of the common people. Yesterday morning, they went to the landlord's place to negotiate, bringing the old and the young, crying and weeping, but they were pushed out by the landlord. It is learned that the male representative, Mr. Bi, and others have hired Lawyer Yu to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, requesting an emergency injunction to stop the building of the fences.</p>
<h3>Inland Water Company</h3>
<p>Cease Acting as Water Installation Agent</p>
<p>Public Utilities Bureau Orders Abolishment</p>
<p>Relevant Clauses in Articles of Association</p>
<p>The Inland Water Company, which provides water to the Shanghai South area, has been concurrently acting as an agent for water installation for users. Therefore, Article 2 of its articles of association states that any addition or modification of faucets and water pipes must be reported to the company in advance. Article 3 states that if users wish to install hot water faucets, etc., they may install them themselves and report to the company for connection, with a connection fee of five yuan per faucet. Article 8 states that all water pipe installations for users shall be handled by the company, which also sets prices for faucet and water pipe materials. Article 9 states that if a faucet is damaged, the company will send someone to repair it; if replacement is necessary, the company will handle the installation. However, the Public Utilities Bureau has urged the company to abandon this concurrent business and change to water pipe merchants handling it. However, the articles of association still follow the old ones. The Public Utilities Bureau had ordered the articles of association to be revised, but it has not yet been completed. It is now learned that the Bureau has ordered the company to suspend all the above clauses before the articles of association are revised, to avoid misunderstanding. However, Schedule of Road Repair Fees in Article 8 (which is actually the water connection fee) should be temporarily retained and has been reported to the municipal government for record.</p>

<h3>One Rice Bowl Costs Two Lives</h3>
<p>In a straw shed at the Dingjia Warehouse north of Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, Shanghai West, lived a laborer named Bo Heshang, 26 years old, from Luodian, Baoshan. He was married to a woman surnamed Mou, 29 years old, and they had two children, one five years old and one three years old. On the 17th of this month, during lunch, the couple argued because the child broke a rice bowl. The Bo family was very poor, and the couple often complained about their fate, so after arguing, the woman went out first, and Bo also walked out later. Unexpectedly, the woman went to a nearby river and committed suicide by drowning, and Bo Heshang, seeing this, also jumped into the water in a moment of desperation. His wife's body floated up the day before yesterday, and Bo's floated up yesterday. The local guarantor has reported to the local court for an autopsy.</p>

<h3>Yun Case Trial Date</h3>
<p>Morning of the 22nd of this month</p>
<p>Trial by Judge Qian Hongye</p>
<p>For the purpose of warning treacherous merchants, Yun Huifang, a member of the Blood Soul Anti-Treason Group, was intercepted by the Chinese police in the French Concession on August 5 when he used explosives to warn Maochang Foreign Goods Store. He was then extradited to the Second Special District Local Court, sentenced to two months' imprisonment, and granted a suspended sentence because he was under sixteen years old. However, the Public Concession Police stated that the bombing of Yongchang Coal Store on Xin Zha Road on the morning of July 28 was also done by Yun, so they transferred Yun from the Second Special Court to the First Special District Local Court. After three trials by Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Court, the defendant was allowed to provide a shop guarantee and the hearing was postponed. At that time, the Public Works Bureau lawyer objected to the bail and appealed to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. On the other hand, he filed another request with the First Special Court, requesting that the presiding judge, Feng Shide, recuse himself and appoint another judge to hear the case. The Second Branch of the High Court approved the ruling on the 23rd of last month, rejecting the appeal. As for the request to change the judge, Judge Feng has always maintained a fair attitude in handling the Yun case. The three hearings were all based on the principles of law and human sentiment, seeking a solution. There was originally no reason for recusal. Later, because the Public Works Bureau had filed this kind of application, he also requested recusal himself so as not to delay the case due to this side issue. The court authorities have now decided to hand over the Yun case to Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court. Judge Qian took leave last month to return to his hometown for his father's funeral. Because the country is in trouble, he did not obtain the mourning period at home, so he has returned to his post after the holiday and is performing his duties as usual. He has already received the case file and scheduled a public trial in the first court of the court on the morning of this Thursday (i.e., the 22nd). All notices and summonses have been issued separately yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Same Trampled</h3>
<p>A Pair of Sister Flowers</p>
<p>Sun Jixiang Kills Two Birds with One Stone</p>
<p>Elder Sister Gives Birth, Then Rapes Younger Sister</p>
<p>The Pity of an Ignorant Girl</p>
<p>The Hatred of a Dangerous Pimp</p>
<p>In the French Concession, the Meyer Silk Weaving Factory on Kangti Road has female workers Gong Jinmei and Gong Sannan, who are sisters. Jinmei is in her early twenties, while Sannan is only nineteen. They are from Wumen and have decent looks. They live together in a certain house nearby. Because their parents are both employed by foreigners, they live separately. In June of last year, Sun Jixiang, a man from Shandong who was already over forty years old, went to look at carpets. He lived at No. 6 Xietu Road. Because he was friends with Jinmei's second landlord, he often visited and got to know Jinmei. He spared no expense and waited near Kangti Road every day, following Jinmei whenever he saw her, and used sweet words to seduce Jinmei. Jinmei's knowledge was shallow, and she was eventually seduced, and began a secret affair with Sun. From then on, he moved Jinmei and her sister to No. 22 South Chengdu Road and lived with them. Sun also falsely claimed that his wife was still vacant and that he had to marry Jinmei. Jinmei believed it and kept it a secret from her mother. Unexpectedly, after several secret encounters, she became pregnant. After a few months, her belly gradually grew larger. Her mother, Gong Qian, knew that her daughter was different and asked her about it. Only then did she learn the truth. But because what’s done is done, she had to endure it. Unexpectedly, Sun Jixiang was indeed a lecher. Because Jinmei was pregnant, his sexual desires could not be satisfied. Seeing that her sister Sannan had the charm of her older sister and was approaching the age of maturity, he thought of killing two birds with one stone. He used sweet words and honeyed words, and in a few days, the affair was completed. From then on, he often took Sannan to hotels for secret rendezvous several times. This pair of sisters was trampled on by Sun. By July of this year, Jinmei was about to give birth, so she was sent to the Zhongde Hospital. On July 7, she gave birth to a son. However, Sun had recently been unemployed and his financial situation was tight. He had no money for all the production costs, so he borrowed thirty yuan from Jinmei's mother. Afterwards, Sun took the child he had given birth to elsewhere. On the one hand, because Gong Qian knew the address where they lived, it was very inconvenient, so he wanted to move to Xiaoshadu to avoid attention. Jinmei learned about it, fearing the worst, so she cried and complained to her mother and stopped going to see him. Sun then reported to the Xin Zha Police Station on the 9th of this month that Gong Jinmei had absconded with 910 yuan worth of his means of earning a living. Until the day before yesterday, Jinmei's parents invited Sun to negotiate at the foreigner's house at No. 56 Nanjing Road (where Gong Qian was employed). A conflict broke out between the languages, and the police brought everyone to the general police station. Sun pointed out that Jinmei was the absconder. This matter had been reported to the Xin Zha Police Station for record, so the police chief transferred the case to the Xin Zha Police Station. After a detailed investigation by Chinese detective Zhu Mengwei and Western detective Bao Tai, it was found that Sun Jixiang had a suspicion of making false accusations, so Sun was detained and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Wang Yaotang, the lawyer of the Chinese Police Station, stated the above situation and said that the current defendant had committed the crime of false accusation under Article 180 of the Criminal Law, but in the future there may be circumstances that harm the family, so please interrogate. According to Gong Jinmei and Gong Sannan, they were both seduced and raped by Sun. According to Gong Qian, the defendant had an affair with my daughter. I didn't know about it until Jinmei was pregnant. When she gave birth, the defendant borrowed 30 yuan from me because he had no money, which he has not yet returned. But he also seduced and raped my second daughter. I only found out about it before yesterday, etc. When questioned, the defendant only admitted to having an affair with Jinmei, but denied seducing and raping Sannan. As for the stolen property, 840 yuan was the transfer fee obtained from transferring the house at No. 92 Jugan Road to a certain sauce maker, etc. After Judge Ge Sixun verified the confession, he asked the defendant to be returned to prison and waited for a postponement of seven days to investigate.</p>

<h3>Xin Xin to Open a Epiphyllum oxypetalum Flower Show</h3>
<p>Epiphyllum oxypetalum is the night-blooming cereus. The saying "a night-blooming cereus flashes in the pan" is often used, but few people have actually seen the true face of the night-blooming cereus. It is known to be a precious and exotic plant. According to historical records, Emperor Yang of Sui visited Yangzhou but did not have time to appreciate it before the flowers withered, which the supreme ruler regretted. During the Renzong period, it was transplanted into the imperial garden, but it withered within a year, showing its value. Now, the night-blooming cereus is about to bloom again. It is said that the owner of the Xin Xin rooftop garden has spared no expense to purchase several plants, which will be displayed near the Chinese Hall around the 20th of this month. In addition to sending letters to celebrities from all walks of life to appreciate them and soliciting articles to publish a special collection, anyone is welcome to appreciate them free of charge. This flower will only be on display for one week and will bloom successively to satisfy the eyes of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Union</h3>
<p>Secretary Attaches Bullet to Extort Manager</p>
<p>Sends Partners to Negotiate Price</p>
<p>At 8:30 AM the day before yesterday, Wang Shichang, the police officer at Post No. 38 of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, received a report from the plaintiff, Pan Yisan, at Guangfu Road that he had been extorted. He immediately took the case and sent it to the detective team to summon witnesses. According to Pan Yisan, 38 years old, from Yuyao, who lives at No. 22 Songshou Lane, Guoqing Road, and is the manager of the Lao Yongchang Coal Shop, he received a threatening letter through the back door on the morning of the 12th of this month, demanding a loan of 5,000 yuan in silver. He was asked to deliver the money to the back of the playground behind the Waterworks on Kanggao Road from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the 13th. The letter also included two pistol bullets. If anyone reported to the police or if anything unexpected happened to his colleagues, he would be dealt with in the same way. However, he did not send anyone to negotiate on the 13th. He originally intended to ignore it, but unexpectedly, on the afternoon of the 14th, he received another letter from the post office, again extorting 5,000 yuan in silver, asking him to negotiate at the side of the China Cement Factory warehouse on Kanggao Road at the end of Minli Road from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM on the 15th, otherwise his life and property would not be safe. He carefully read the handwriting and found that it was written by one person. And he is a standing committee member of the Coal Industry Union and often sees the documents when reviewing them, so he went to the Coal Industry Union to check the documents. When checking, he saw many letters from the Coal Industry Workers' Union, which were in the same handwriting as the anonymous letter. It was obvious that the secretary of the Workers' Union wrote them, so he found out that the secretary's name was Yao Suikai, so he asked them to pursue and arrest him. However, his partner Zhang Xiaoyang was suspected of colluding with Yao and others. On the morning of the 15th, he asked Zhang to go to negotiate, and the price increased from 100 yuan to 500 yuan, but it was unsuccessful. It was agreed that they would continue to negotiate at the original location on the 16th. From this point of view, there were some loopholes. After the detectives brought Zhang to the case, they also interrogated various confessions, and Zhang had a deficit of more than 2,100 yuan in the store, which he could not make up for, which may have led to this last resort. The other cases brought in were Yao Suikai, Xu Fu, Chen Shengsan, etc., and their statements were all evasive. After the interrogating officer verified the confession, he charged them with attaching bullets to extort money and ordered the offenders and evidence to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi</h3>
<p>Author of "Memoirs of a European Tour"</p>
<p>Inscription by Wang Jingwei... Preface by Wu Zhihui</p>
<p>Published by the Travel Agency... Publication at the End of October</p>
<p>Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, has toured Europe four times and is most familiar with European customs and conditions. Last year, at the invitation of the China Travel Agency, he wrote "Travels in Western Europe," which was published in the Travel Magazine. After a year, he finished describing a portion of France, totaling more than 50,000 words. Readers found the original book to be highly engaging, with vivid writing and exquisite illustrations, and passed it around eagerly, praising it as an immortal work. Many people sent letters requesting a special book for permanent preservation. Mr. Chu, unwilling to disregard the readers' wishes, revised and augmented the entire book in his spare time. At the request of Mr. Wang Jingwei, he renamed it "Memoirs of a European Tour," and requested Mr. Wang to write a prominent inscription and Mr. Wu Zhihui to write a preface, a grand composition of several thousand words. The end says "In the end, this is another wonderful book about human actions on Earth, a publication that can provide people with lingering admiration and evoke infinite emotions, and will undoubtedly surpass Sima Qian's writings in its ability to capture beauty in the past." The value of this book is evident. The entire book focuses on travel, interspersed with descriptions of local customs, politics, military affairs, education, and the conditions of overseas Chinese in various places, using lively writing to depict interesting events, making it enjoyable to read over and over again. The places described, such as Hong Kong, Saigon, Singapore, Colombo, Penang, Chuva Titi, Suez, Cairo, Port Said, Marseille, Lyon, Paris, Tours, Bordeaux, and Strasbourg, are all filled with picturesque scenery and abundant interest. Mr. Chu is skilled in photography, which is admired by the world. The book contains no fewer than one hundred photographs, all of great value and never seen outside. It is by no means comparable to other travelogues that use printed landscape paintings. Furthermore, in previous years, Mr. Wang Jingwei, Mr. Wu Zhihui, Mr. Li Shizeng, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, Mr. Zhang Puquan, and other gentlemen engaged in revolution in Europe, enduring great hardships. Mr. Wu Zhihui personally worked as a typesetter, typesetting propaganda books and newspapers, which is still regarded as a good story. Mr. Chu personally experienced the same circumstances, so his descriptions of revolutionary work are particularly detailed, making them inspiring to read and not just for travel viewing. The entire book is about one hundred pages long, printed on heavy-weight art cream-colored paper in regular Han characters. The cover is made of thick cloth-patterned paper, which is very elegant. The actual sales price is one dollar and fifty cents per copy, with a pre-order price of one dollar. Pre-order coupons are on sale immediately and will be closed on October 20th of this year. The publication date is at the end of October. For pre-orders from other places, the deadline is based on the postmark of the post office, plus a postal fee of sixteen cents. The general distributor is the China Travel Agency on Sichuan Road in Shanghai. Branches in various cities and large bookstores also have agents for sale. Mr. Chu traveled to Europe four times to complete this great work. Now, readers who obtain this book and read it can feel as if they have lived in Europe for ten years.</p>

Since a petition has also been submitted to the police department, wait for the department to submit it for review and action." This is the approval.</p>
<h3>Cargo Truck Industry</h3>
<p>Suspects the Inspection Office of Deliberately Making Things Difficult</p>
<p>Please ask the Taxpayer Association to negotiate with the Public Works Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ratepayers' Association wrote to the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday, saying: "To the Director-General: According to a letter from the Shanghai Cargo Truck Trade Association, all of our members have suffered from the deliberate obstruction and unreasonable oppression of the Inspection Office of the Public Works Department on Gordon Road when inspecting vehicles. The details are described to the Association, and they requested to petition the Public Works Department for improvement so that they can receive the same treatment as Westerners operating this industry. Our Association is the legal organization of the industry leader and should report the suffering of the industry to the Bureau for relief. Considering that Chinese merchants in the Settlement should be protected by your Association, we respectfully submit the suffering of the industry, asking you to negotiate seriously with the Bureau to benefit the entire industry a little bit. (1) The Inspection Office believes that vehicles purchased a long time ago are prone to accidents and will not issue vehicle licenses next season. The cause of the accident depends on the responsiveness of the machinery and not the age of the vehicle. Moreover, the purchase order does not specify how many months the vehicle can be used. The Inspection Office deliberately picks on old vehicles and indirectly promotes the sales of car dealers. This should be negotiated by your Association with the Bureau. (2) The Inspection Office uses trivial methods to inspect vehicle machinery. For example, if you go for inspection on a certain day, they say that a certain part needs to be repaired. When a certain part is repaired, and you go for inspection again, they say that another part needs to be repaired. This happens more than ten times, or at least five or six times, back and forth, consuming more than twenty days of inspection time, making it impossible to operate. How can our members bear such a significant loss? Therefore, for the inspection of machinery, a repair list should be provided so that the car owner can repair according to the list, saving inspection procedures and unnecessary trips. This should be requested by your Association to negotiate with the Bureau. (3) The damage to vehicle machinery is closely related to operations. If the machinery is not responsive, it has already been repaired. Moreover, the most important causes of accidents are the brakes and the wheel pans. If there is any slight damage, the driver will not want to take the risk. Therefore, when the car is driven to the Inspection Office for inspection, its machinery is very complete, but the Inspection Office must add all kinds of harsh criticisms. Even the slightest damage to the wooden boards and paint must be re-organized. All these criticisms are unbearable. This should be requested by your Association to negotiate with the Bureau. (4) After the vehicle is inspected and the car license is issued, the industry thought it could live and work in peace, but the Inspection Office sent inspectors to patrol everywhere. Even vehicles that are loading goods or driving on the road are forced to say that their machinery is damaged, and their licenses are confiscated. If there is damage, how can they walk? Their intentions can be imagined. Our industry has suffered repeated oppression, and the losses are unknown. This should be requested by your Association to negotiate with the Bureau. (5) Vehicle inspections are divided into grades, marked with A, B, and C. Those listed as A are inspected once a year, B twice a year, and C must be inspected every quarter. There is even an edict to cancel the donation certificate. The Public Works Department's inspection of vehicles is in good faith, and once a year is the most appropriate method. If the current semi-annual or quarterly inspections are carried out, and there are many obstacles during the inspection, the deprivation of business hours is unimaginable. Our members absolutely dare not agree to the grading inspection, but under the oppression of the Public Works Department, they dare not say anything. This should be seriously negotiated by your Association with the Bureau. (6) It is said that Western-operated trucks are not only not graded for inspection, but they are not inspected at all. Does the Bureau's method discriminate based on nationality? If it is said that the trucks of Western car companies are reliable, then the trucks purchased by our members are all purchased from abroad. The Public Works Department's politics should be equal to all, and should not be taken lightly. This should be requested by your Association to negotiate with the Bureau. In summary, the suffering of our members is all undeserved. May I ask if the police are investigating the circumstances of car accidents, which are definitely not as conditional as the Inspection Office, nor do they depend on the age of the car? The Public Works Department uses vehicle inspection to avoid car accidents, which is enough to open up opportunities for vehicle inspectors to take advantage of opportunities, and the example of dividing into A, B, and C grades is even more unreasonable. In recent years, the machinery of newly purchased cars is not as strong as that of old cars. Moreover, car dealers must repay foreign car companies' money on a monthly basis for two years, and it will not be fully repaid until two years, but the Inspection Office is listed as C grade.</p>
<p>There are situations where it is impossible to obtain a car license, and car dealers want to earn a little profit but cannot, and they are bound to close down one after another. The Public Works Department is really responsible for destroying commerce. We dare to express our grievances and ask for your handling." According to this, treatment equality is the highest principle of a fair agency, and protecting the public and facilitating merchants is an essential behavior for a fair agency. If what the Trade Association said is correct, our Association has the need to ask your Bureau to improve. Please investigate and handle it.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Quotations from Ma Xiangbo, the 93-Year-Old</p>
<h3>China's Land Problem</h3>
<p>President Yang of the Academia Sinica came to visit and talked about China's land problem. The old Mr. Ma shared the plan he had drafted.</p>
<p>"Our country is an ancient civilization, known to the world. Therefore, the issue of border demarcation is determined by the strength or weakness of the country. First of all, for the land within the territory, it is necessary to conduct a thorough measurement to know an accurate number," said the old Mr. Ma.</p>
<p>President Yang then said: "The Social Research Institute of the Academia Sinica recently investigated the mu (unit of area) in a certain area of Jiangsu, and the sizes and types are as many as hundreds. It really needs to be rectified."</p>
<p>"According to the astronomical latitude and longitude, measuring the size of the place is more accurate," the old Mr. Ma further explained and elaborated.</p>
<p>I briefly reported that Mr. Zeng Shiying recently used this method to estimate the area of ​​various provinces and regions, and the results showed that the area of ​​Shandong was larger than that estimated by predecessors. Later, the old Mr. Ma elaborated on his proposal.</p>
<p>The new land law proposed by the old Mr. Ma can be summarized into two major principles:</p>
<p>First: Formulation of the Land Contract Law. The old Mr. Ma said: "For towns, or three mu, two mu, or one mu as one contract; for farmland, or fifty mu, thirty mu, or fifteen mu as one contract. Each county varies according to commerce and fertility. The contract tax is four yuan per contract, which is retained for each county to establish agricultural, industrial, commercial, and official banks; and poor households can write loan vouchers to borrow from them. In addition to the four yuan, add a paper registration fee of five jiao, which is divided equally between the central government and the counties. (Excerpt from the proposed constitution summary; different)</p>
<p>Second: Requisition of National Defense Areas. The old Mr. Ma said: "All sides of large mountains and large waters must have a certain number of li and zhang (units of length) that are state-owned, otherwise forests, waterways, and national defense cannot be governed."</p>
<h3>Forget Nine</h3>
<p>— Leshan</p>
<p>It's one generation younger than forgetting eight!</p>
<p>"The moon is especially bright in mid-autumn," but this year's Mid-Autumn Festival, the moonlit sky in the first half of the night did not have any light, but was deeply hidden in the pervasive clouds of sorrow. Perhaps it was the sentimental moon goddess, who could not bear to shine her reunited brilliance on the shattered mountains and rivers, and even more could not bear to see the heroic and tragic situation of the volunteer soldiers' bloody battle!</p>
<p>Sentimental me, after being drunk, suddenly felt a lot of emotions, picked up a blunt pen, wanted to write a few sentences to relieve my sorrow, but I was full of complaints and mixed feelings, I didn't know where to start, so I just wrote the two words "Forget Nine" on a blank sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Show Mei came over to look at it and smiled: "You wrote the title wrong, what are you still doing with the article? There has always been the abusive term "forget eight", how could there be any "forget nine"?</p>
<p>So I blurted out: "With the "forget eight" of the past, there will naturally be the "forget nine" of today. Listen to me:</p>
<p>Among our many national humiliations, the most painful are "May 9" and "September 18", which are truly strange shames and great insults, but the forgetful masses have long forgotten them completely. Not to mention anything else, just taking inferior goods as an example, they are filling the market again, and how many Chinese people do not use inferior goods? And how many people are determined to lie on firewood and taste gall, firmly remembering "May 9" and "September 18"? Alas, isn't this "forget nine"?</p>
<p>After the success of the Northern Expedition, we often saw or heard the slogan: "You are not good, overthrow you, I will do it"! But they only shouted it out, and were unwilling to do it. And after overthrowing others, when it came to their own turn to do it, they had already forgotten the "do" in "I will do it", so some people ridiculed them as "forget nine", which is one generation younger than "forget eight".</p>
<h3>Witty Remarks</h3>
<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>The beast country, in view of the new trends in the world, and all the outdated things, especially in terms of clothing, there is a need for improvement, so it eagerly convened a modern fashion association. All the beasts gathered, and elected the president of the fashion conference, with the modernized one as qualified. A snow lion and a pug wagged their tails and stood up and said: "This seat's hair is as white as snow, and the curls are very stylish. The ripple style of the mortal modern ladies is nothing more than that. I really have the qualifications to be elected." An old ox said proudly: "This person has always adhered to the purpose of creating a big grandmother, hanging down repeatedly, which is very pleasing to the eye, unlike the modern ladies who apply artificial surgery. Please pay attention to all comrades." A mantis raised its arms and said: "This concubine's slender waist and big ass, I also dare not belittle myself." A scabby dog next to him barked urgently. Everyone laughed and said: "You beast, do you also have modern qualifications?" The scabby dog pointed to his bloody hind leg and said: "This slave implements the non-wearing principle, which is fragrant, beautiful, fleshy, and sensual. Can't it be regarded as the flower of modernity?" Everyone suddenly realized, with a burst of applause, they supported the scabby dog ​​as the president of the fashion conference.</p>
<h3>Modern Literature and Art</h3>
<p>— Sha Yu</p>
<p>How can the literature of troubled times compare with the reality in the picture?</p>
<p>This seems too weird! In this country of ours, where Japan recognizes the puppet state, and the civil war is about to end, and the country is about to perish: the windows of bookstores and the newsstands on the street are displaying pictorials, which are like exhibitions of beauty calendar girls. They are really powdery and creamy, with delicate flowers and charming moons! And the nude models of those healthy and beautiful girls, even more show the gorgeous artistic colors!</p>
<p>Who doesn't love the truth in the picture? What's more, the modern fashionable ladies are generously showing the public their delicate beauty, especially the beautiful photos of the ladies looking for a way out are clearly visible when you open the book, which is a great feast for the eyes. Which young people with burning hearts don't have one in their hands!</p>
<p>Old-style novels seem to have failed; new-style novels about love triangles have also seen a sharp drop in sales; even those great collections of novels such as "Secret Records of the Flesh Forest" that are full of seduction have disappeared from the former popularity. Compared with pictorials, they are clearly overshadowed. So the once popular novel magazines have declined like the morning stars after dawn, struggling with the last breath.</p>
<p>Some people say: The first art of modern combination is movies. Good silent movies don't need a lot of explanatory text. What's more, the current popular ALLSINGING, alltalking, alldancing sound movies naturally don't need text. Modern literature and art, of course, can't escape this rule! What's more, numb people need stimulating artistic things, so naturally text is not as good as pictures.</p>
<h3>National Language Class</h3>
<p>— Jin Butong</p>
<p>丨A Classroom Snapshot丨</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, wearing old-fashioned spectacles and carrying his national language lecture notes, arrives to teach the third-year class. As soon as Mr. Wang steps into the classroom, he is suddenly bumped into head-on by a student, almost knocking his spectacles off his nose. The whole classroom erupts in laughter. Mr. Wang calmly pushes his spectacles up and quietly steps onto the platform, opens the attendance book, and calls out the names one by one. All thirty-three students in the class are present.</p>
<p>At this moment, a coarse voice comes from the back row: "Mr. Wang, is no one absent? How come I count only twenty-one people? Aha, Mr. Wang is pocketing salaries!" Mr. Wang pretends not to hear and opens his lecture notes, saying, "Today, we will discuss 'The Sound of Autumn,' a masterpiece unprecedented and unsurpassed. Everyone, please listen attentively!"</p>
<p>"Okay, everyone, listen carefully! Today Mr. Wang will lecture on 'Autumn Tigers'!" says the student with the coarse voice in the back row, in a comical tone. Everyone bursts into laughter.</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Wang will lecture on male tigers!" another student chimes in, and the laughter grows even louder. At the same time, all the boys' eyes are drawn, without prior agreement, to the six girls in the front row, frightening the girls so much that they dare not turn around.</p>
<p>"No more nonsense! Whoever speaks nonsense again will be penalized!" Mr. Wang says angrily. Some bury themselves in a copy of "Laughing and Crying Marriage," studying it with relish; some tap on the desk, softly humming "Killing the Fish at Home"; some stealthily write love letters with fountain pens; some simply put their heads on their arms and doze off. Only then does the atmosphere become a little quieter.</p>
<p>When the bell rings, Mr. Wang pushes his spectacles up again and hurriedly leaves the classroom with his lecture notes. The students all stretch and make faces at Mr. Wang's back.</p>
<h3>The Rotary Club of Storytelling Silks (19)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>"Suicide!... Murder!" He murmurs to himself, realizing that neither should be considered now. Suicide is a sign of cowardice and weakness; murder should be reserved for the battlefield, to kill the enemies of his country. Just then, Fenruo comes downstairs, holding a small package in her hand.</p>
<p>"What is it!" He stops abruptly, alarmed. He can see that her face is not good. "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"I want to leave this gun with you. It seems inappropriate to wear a gun to the ceremony." Regiment Commander Yuan cleverly disguises his intentions and hands the gun to Fenruo.</p>
<p>"Are you giving it to me as a memento?" Fenruo is a little unnatural, but she still reaches out to take the gun.</p>
<p>"If you like it, I can give it to you, but what will you give me in return?"</p>
<p>Fenruo walks to the table and carefully puts down the gun and the package. "This is the result of my efforts for more than ten years. Please take good care of it." As she speaks, she opens the package.</p>
<p>"Ah! This is your embroidered portrait, you embroidered it yourself."</p>
<p>"Yes, one of them is an embroidered portrait for you, because I always embroidered these two portraits late at night, so no one ever saw me. I relied on my memory, imitating and embroidering in each imagination. Maybe it doesn't look very much like you, please forgive me!"</p>
<p>"It looks just like you, just like a photograph!" Regiment Commander Yuan holds the two embroidered pieces at arm's length, looking at them from left to right, unable to put them down.</p>
<p>Fenruo silently gazes at Regiment Commander Yuan's expression, as if in a trance, not noticing his delighted expression.</p>
<p>"What a pity!... What a pity!" Regiment Commander Yuan says to himself.</p>
<p>"What a pity what?"</p>
<p>"It's a pity that you didn't embroider a military uniform, it's a pity that you embroidered it too young." Regiment Commander Yuan seems to cherish his youthful years, which have passed like flowing water.</p>
<p>"Didn't I already say that I was imitating the young Mr. Yuan Hefu, not embroidering today's Regiment Commander Yuan."</p>
<p>"Alas! Youth has passed, but look, my temples are already turning white." Regiment Commander Yuan points to a few strands of white hair on his head.</p>
<p>"Of course, you have worked so hard on the battlefield!" Fenruo says, suddenly concentrating on her thoughts, and takes a mirror with a missing corner from the drawer of the table, looking at her face.</p>
<p>"Your beauty has not changed." Regiment Commander Yuan steps forward to look at Fenruo's expression in the mirror.</p>
<p>"Really? But don't I also have two strands of white hair on my temples?" Fenruo finds two strands of silver hair on her left temple, forcefully plucks them out, and clips them between her fingers.</p>

<h3>Sickness</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>"A hero is most afraid of sickness like a demon" is originally the most unfortunate thing in life, and also an irresistible thing. However, recently, some important people, unable to cooperate or handle difficult matters, are unwilling to do so, and often use illness as an excuse to resign, which is also a very fashionable thing these days.</p>
<p>Regarding Mr. Wang Jingwei's recent illness, whether it is a genuine illness or a feigned illness, Mr. Wang Jingwei, as a veteran of the revolution, took office as the President of the Executive Yuan with great enthusiasm in January of this year. At this time, the situation between China and Japan was already very serious, and Mr. Wang was not afraid of sacrifice and resolutely took office. This shows that Mr. Wang's revolutionary spirit of several decades has not diminished in the slightest. However, on August 6, Mr. Wang suddenly issued five telegrams of resignation from Shanghai, in which he said to Mr. Zhang Xueliang, "Resigning to apologize to you alone." Others have considered this resignation to be making a big deal out of a small issue, and that it is unbecoming of the President of the Executive Yuan. Later, after the exhortation of several important people, Mr. Wang managed to go to Beijing.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Mr. Wang secretly left Beijing again a few days ago, claiming illness, and has not made a statement. Now, when the country is in distress and the diplomacy is in a critical time, the central government has repeatedly sent people to urge him, but Mr. Wang is still proceeding slowly, avoiding seeing guests and making no statement. This kind of attitude is very incomprehensible. Is Mr. Wang genuinely ill, or is he feigning illness? If he is genuinely ill, he should still exert himself in his official duties and manage the country from his sickbed, so as not to be ashamed of being a great man who loves the party and the country. If he is feigning illness, then it is even more unknown what he is feigning.</p>
<p>Assuming that he is still resigning because of Mr. Zhang, when Mr. Wang went to Beijing for the second time, Mr. Zhang had resigned in name but not in reality, and Mr. Wang had already known this. Assuming that he is not resigning because of Mr. Zhang, then who is he opposing? If he is resigning because of the urgency of diplomacy and the difficulty of coping with it, then it is even less like something that Mr. Wang, who is rich in revolutionary spirit, should do. Is Mr. Wang genuinely ill, or is he feigning illness?</p>

<h3>The Words of Tobacco</h3>
<p>— Meng Fu</p>
<p>Tobacco (TOBACCO) was originally a kind of smoke smoked by the natives of Cuba in North America. Now, it is almost impossible to find a place in the world where it does not exist. Tobacco is used to make cigarettes, which are convenient to carry and simple to smoke. Therefore, the number of people who smoke it is also increasing. At first, they think it is a pastime, but it is harmless to smoke it. Little do they know that after smoking it for a long time and becoming addicted to it, the harm is very great. Now, let's make a scientific analysis of this tobacco:</p>
<p>In botany, tobacco belongs to the eggplant family. Most of the things that belong to the eggplant family are poisonous. Even eggplants, which are commonly eaten, can harm the throat if eaten too much. Therefore, all singers should not eat them. The main components of tobacco roughly include the following: (1) Nicotine (NICOTINE), also known as tobacco essence, (2) Ammonia (AMMONIA), (3) Sulfuretted hydrogen (SULPHuretted hydrogen), (4) Carbon monoxide, (5) Acetic acid (acetricacid), (6) Butyric acid, (7) Various carbohydrates. Among the above eight kinds, nicotine is the most important. Now, let's describe nicotine below:</p>
<p>Nicotine is a colorless oily liquid, easily soluble in water, and emits an unpleasant odor. Its boiling point is 246.7 degrees. In tobacco leaves, nicotine is combined with citric acid and malic acid to form a salt. As for its properties, it is very poisonous. Just five milligrams (Milligram, Note: one milligram is equal to one thousandth of a gram) of pure nicotine can kill a dog in two minutes. It is said that there was a child who used the cigarette holder that an adult had smoked for a long time to play the game of blowing soap bubbles. Without realizing it, the child inhaled a lot into his mouth. Later, in less than three days, the child died from nicotine poisoning. From this, it can be seen that nicotine is very poisonous.</p>
<p>Since tobacco contains such a poisonous substance as nicotine, many adverse phenomena will occur after using it in large quantities, such as a yellow complexion and little blood, slight dizziness from time to time, insomnia at night, sore throat, and easy eye diseases. According to the results of various animal experiments, the brain is most affected by nicotine in higher animals. Therefore, the most harmful thing for smokers is the decline in memory. The harm of smoking is especially great for underage people whose development is not yet complete.</p>
<p>However, according to the research results of several modern scientists, tobacco is not absolutely useless. It has the effect of killing such acute infectious bacteria as cholera</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>In addition to this, it also has the same effect on dysentery bacteria. However, I think there are all kinds of effective drugs to prevent and cure these diseases. If you want to rely on tobacco to eliminate toxins, then the toxins have not been eliminated but you have already been harmed. I think this method will not be adopted by wise people after all!</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the Problem of Early Marriage and a Reply to Mr. Ayan</h3>
<p>— Wenbing</p>
<p>I have read Mr. Ayan's "My Observations on Early Marriage" in today's (13th) newspaper. The attitude and writing style are both excellent and admirable! However, I cannot fully agree with his theory, so I think this problem still needs to be discussed. Therefore, I will ramble a few more sentences. Whether it is "nitpicking" or there is still some truth in it, it remains for the wise readers to evaluate. For the sake of clarity, I will divide it into three sections according to Mr. Ayan's article: (1) Is early marriage really no longer a problem? (2) Is early marriage harmless? (3) The problem of masturbation.</p>
<p>(1) I am honored that Mr. Ayan has praised my previous article on the causes of early marriage, and considers it to be roughly the same as his meaning. However, Mr. Ayan said: "However, due to the shift in trends, these explanations can no longer be applied to recent times. Although the family organization is still struggling, these organizations have been destroyed by the new torrent. In the vast rural society, except for a very small number of landlords and rich peasants, most people are living in bankruptcy and displacement, and they have no time to take care of themselves, so of course they cannot talk about early marriage." Of course, Chinese society is no longer the original feudal society, but the remnants of feudalism are still very strong, shrouding Chinese society. In other words, there has been a deformed development of capitalism in the cities, but only bankruptcy is seen in the countryside. It is neither feudal nor capitalistic. Although most people are living in bankruptcy and displacement, crying out in pain, they are still deeply poisoned by feudalism, and their thoughts, ethics, and habits are mostly the same. They still want to taste the taste of early marriage. Facts tell us that early marriage is still very common in Chinese society, so it is still a problem. The future is the future. The argument in my previous article refers to the current society. Mr. Ayan also said: "In the city... has received modern education, is fascinated... love, parents' control of marriage. Has long been lost, how do you know that the so-called modern education, only a small number of bourgeois children can enjoy, so free love, only a small number of people can talk about, most parents still hold the power of marriage, groups of men and women who have not received modern education, are still in the "parents' order, matchmaker's words, under, the old-fashioned marriage is prevalent, early marriage, and how can this kind of broad problem be generalized by a small number of urban deformed phenomena? As for the urban proletariat, there is indeed no possibility of early marriage, Mr. Ayan said very correctly!</p>
<p>(2) It is especially difficult to agree with Mr. Ayan's refusal to admit that early marriage is harmful. He said: "Most people think that early marriage is the biggest loss in terms of physical fitness, but it is not entirely true. The main thing is to see how the person's development is... Early marriage can remedy the problem of youth masturbation (another discussion)... It is better to have early marriage than to have illegal ejaculation." According to physiology, boys and girls have sexual needs at the age of twelve, and after the age of fourteen, they gradually mature and the needs are more urgent. However, when it is time to develop and do the basic work of being a human being, if they are allowed to marry early, reason cannot defeat emotion, and they will naturally be immersed in the land of tenderness. "Brother," "Sister," "Hugging," "Kissing," "...", will they not cut short his and her body and future? I have a classmate who died because of this, and his wife also died of miscarriage because her development was not complete. As for saying: "... The economic problem is not a problem... The occurrence of early marriage... Depends on the economic environment... People who have economic concerns about childbearing have no possibility of early marriage..." But the facts are just the opposite. Many people in the countryside, although they have economic difficulties, still marry early. There are even cases of bringing young sons and daughters-in-law to do hard labor and beg. Is it right for people with good economic conditions to marry early? It is laughable!</p>
<p>(3) Masturbation is of course the worst behavior of young men and women, and the harm is even greater than early marriage, but we should also find ways to reform it, and never think that it is a serious harm to use early marriage to remedy it! Finally, Mr. Ayan also said: "In the future, the combination of the two sexes can be allowed to be natural..." I would like to ask: If there are twelve or thirteen-year-old boys and girls who want to explore the taste of sex, can they also be allowed to be natural, and let him or her try or combine? I don't know if Mr. Ayan has thought about this statement?</p>
<p>My conclusion: In the current social strata in China, most people are still inheriting early marriage, except for a few people. I still think that early marriage is harmful, especially to the body. Masturbation is another problem and needs to be solved separately. Early marriage should still be reformed, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to offer Mr. Ayan two words: "Facts are eloquent! When looking at problems, you should especially focus on the big picture!"</p>
<h3>Replies to Letters</h3>
<p>Reply to Letter 1 Mr. Jin Yusan's platform: My brother brought home the newspaper clippings from school last night, that is, your letter to the editor of the supplement of this port on August 17, but it has been 27 days. Now, I respectfully reply below, please forgive me. Check that the English name of "sulfuric acid indigo" is IndigoSulphale. The translation is very clear. I don't know why the Western pharmacies and instrument stores don't know what kind of medicine it is. Moreover, the Shixue Tongyi Society sells one ounce for 42 cents, and the Scientific Instrument Museum sells 50 grams (Gram) for 66 cents. Both are ready-made solutions (Solution). If you want to buy a large quantity, you can buy it from the Da Yanliao firm. You are especially interested in various chemical process experiments. I am very happy to hear about it, because our country needs this kind of product. I wish you progress. Brother Li Naizheng hands on September 13</p>
<p>Reply to Letter 2 Mr. Shi Dongjian: I saw your great work yesterday. I would like to know where I can sell the scattered medicines used in the method of making ink and erasing ink. I hope you can inform me in the newspaper. Please also have a good autumn. Ding Huo Shang</p>
