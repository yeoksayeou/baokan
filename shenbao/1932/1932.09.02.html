<p>日軍佔據東北之始即藉口於自衛此次内田外相在國會演說猶以自衛權爲言而近日所傳長江嚴重形勢日人亦謂不得已時或將取必要之自衛行動吾人誠不知其所謂自衛爲如何解釋吾國人駁斥日人之自衛說者衆矣日人曾不稍動於中今吾再將日人而且爲軍界中有名之日人石丸少佐諭自衛權譯舉一節以吿日本當局與世界之關心遠東時局者尙有理由以否認其說者乎其言曰</p>
<p>我日軍以奔馬之勢一日間竟占領奉天長春寛城子南嶺安東鳳凰城營口撫順公主嶺等滿鐵沿線各要點吾不禁發生疑問以爲我陸軍如此無限制占領到底以何處爲止境乎無限制之占領即逸出自衛權之範圍我國際法威權家立足太郎博士諭自衛權云［甲國得進入乙國領土妨害乙國主權作用而爲自衛行爲但在嚴正之法理論上須備有下列條件（一）國家本身或其機關或臣民所受危害已急迫時（二）以他種手段到底不能達到除去危害之目的且爲欲除去危害非用該手段不可時（三）除去危害所行之行爲不得超過除去危害之必要程度（四）危害非出於行自衛之國家亦非出於其機關之不法行爲時充自衛之必要有時始可入於戰爭狀態故純粹之法理論於自衛權之應否發動全然不許行自衛權之國家自由决定若認爲不具備上述條件時乙國得不認甲國自衛權之發動］</p>

<p>至於釆礦事業　溯自光緒迄於今茲、前後凡四十餘年、各省之組織公司、以新法開採者、全國仍不過數十處、如江蘇之賈汪公司、安徽之烈山及官礦局、吉林之奶子山公司、裕東及穆陵煤礦公司、浙江之長興公司、山東之魯大及中興公司等、黑龍江之鶴岡煤礦、札蘭諾爾煤礦公司·山西之保晋公司等、河北之開滐·井陘正豐等公司、遼寗之撫順·烟台·本溪·湖五·湖嘴·西安·八道濠等煤礦公司、熱河之北票公司、河南之福公司·及中原·六河溝·等公司、河北之臨城·怡立·中和·齋堂·柳江·門頭溝·雞鳴山·等煤礦公司、江西之萍鄉等、其餘均屬土窰、亦且或作或輟、即此現有之數十公司、亦或感於經濟之困難、亦或因事變而改組、總之、今茲尙多未臻發達之境、可斷言也、</p>
<p>各省開釆以及工作之經過、情况不同、難於嬋述、茲以山西爲全國產量之冠、特略述山西一省、用示槪况、</p>

<p>再者、東北煤礦　亦復蘊藏甚豐、我國迄今尙少正確之統計、而日人則注意已久、調查惟恐不力、按東三省每年出產鐵一百三十一萬七千噸、煤九百二十五萬噸、鉛四五百噸、銅七八百噸、菱苦土鑛二萬餘噸、滑石二萬三千噸、其未經開釆之煤、則日本所調查者、爲四十二億九百餘噸、而目下每年三省所消費之煤、僅二百五十萬噸、則足敷一千六百八十餘年之用矣、茲幷將其所在地點藏量列表於下、所在地　　　　藏量　　　　煤質</p>
<p>（以萬噸爲單位）</p>
<p>撫順　　　一·ＯＯＯ·ＯＯＯ噸褐炭青瀝炭</p>

<h3 id="c194">夫婦不和的救星 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>鬧得烏眼雞似的夫婦們，不須委任律師，不須聲明離異，祇須請到兩位救星，便可復爲夫婦如初，烏眼雞變成了比翼禽。</p>
<p>救星是誰？不是沙和尙，便是隊隊。</p>
<p>沙和尙是什麽？沙和尙又名砂挼子，是一種毛蟲，會得旋土作洞，造成蟻的地獄，使蟻類墮落其中，以供它的大嚼，性喜睡，又喚睡蟲：有人捉到了它，納入夫婦的枕中，可以調和夫婦倆的感情。陳藏器的本草是這般說，堅瓠集，和常談隨錄，也是這般說。所以，沙和尙是夫婦不和的救星。</p>
<p>隊隊是什麽？隊隊也是蟲名，形如壁蝨；出必雌雄偕行，和挽臂同行的好夫妻一般；產地在雲南及緬甸等處。有人捕得，賣給紳富人家，往往價値兼金，於是納入銀匣，裝在夫婦的枕頭裏面，永永和好，决無反目的事。游宦餘談，是這般說，詹景鳳小辨，也是這般說，所以隊隊是夫婦不和的救星。</p>
<p>區區的蟲類，眞個可以做得夫婦不和的救星麽？不經實騐，是不會知曉的。我勸失和的夫婦們：相隨百步，尙有徘徊之意：何况同床，同枕，同衾，同被？人人能這麽一想，救星即在方寸間，便不用乞靈於微蟲了。</p>
<h3 id="c195">精神文明 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 乙未生</p>
<p>國人聽者</p>
<p>精神文明的思想，確實害了我們不淺。因爲有了尊重精神，輕視物質的觀念，於是遇着一切不可堪的事情都以精神文明的方法來自解。例如有些壞人，人家給他們以豺狼虎豹，毒蛇猛獸等惡名，這不過形容其惡毒而已，並不是說他們確是這些東西也。然而有許多人吃了這些惡人的虧，沒有勇氣去抵抗或者報復，心理便私下拿精神文明的方法來自解道：［他不是人，他是野獸，是毒蛇。我是人。人何必去同野獸毒蛇計較短長呢？］由這個精神文明的念頭一想，便萬事俱休，什麽恥辱也忍受了，什麽侵犯也容許了。小而個人，大而家國，都用這麽一個精神文明的念頭來自制。誰知那侮辱你的人，實際仍然是人，斷不會因爲你的精神念頭一想便居然變成了眞的蛇獸。你不同他計較麽？他偏要同你計較。他沒有變成蛇獸之慮，而你自已倒有牛馬奴隸之虞了。况且就使是眞的蛇獸，如果來侵犯到我們，我們能不應付它一下嗎？以我所見，惟有血氣方剛的孩子們才不懂得什麽是精神文明，也沒有染着精神文明的毒。</p>

<p>— 經伯</p>
<p>少婦與老婆子之分</p>
<p>［Ladies　first！］爲甚麽？因爲女人比男子柔弱些；還有懷身孕的，抱着小孩子的，在走路，乘車，以及其他公共塲所就會感覺種種不便；所以男子遇到，本着一種惻隱的本能和道德觀念，總該要讓着伊們些；擁擠的時候，讓伊們先走；危險的時候讓伊們先避；在車船裏面，先讓伊們坐下；這是社會生活應有的道德表示，生物護羣的本能，本來沒有虚榮和企求的心理的厮混在内，也不是看不起女人软弱無能。但是，在街車裏面，我們常會見到，華美的少婦，很容易得人家讓坐，襤褸的貧婆只有立着！</p>
<p>在情理上講，無論伊怎樣的一位少婦，另外一位老婆子，上了公共電車或汽車，找不着座，立在自已面前，這時正好自已和朋友的兩個座位可以讓給伊們，當然一齊站起來，讓伊們倆坐。假使只有一個座位，就要讓老婆子先坐，因爲伊是女人中的弱者。道理本來很平常：可是爲有美目之注視，微笑之報酬和一聲銷魂蝕骨的［謝儂，］或者［對不住］的企求，和馬路專爲汽車而設一樣［讓坐］幾乎專爲華美少女而設的了。</p>
<p>再申言之：倘使少女而不華美，在一般讓座的乘客是與可以不讓的老婆子等量齊觀的。這裏除掉沒有上述的種種企求外，還有一種［不必讓］的心理。</p>
<p>這個重大的啓示就是：道德行爲的出發點是在［利已］與［階級］觀念之間？</p>

<p>好一部廣吿敎科書</p>
<p>廣吿之於營業，其吸引魔力之偉大神效，殆不可思議十年來國人　知注意，不惜鈎心鬥角，互爭雄長，以獵取報紙間之一日勝負；蓋已瞭然舍餌得魚，僅需少許宣傳費用，而能贏獲什百千倍之利藪也。</p>
<p>顧廣吿文字，如何而可引人入勝？其中須具巧思，非慧心妙手莫辨。吾人試一展讀外報，其化腐朽爲神奇之廣吿，從可知外人之廣吿學，已步武科學發展之後，而趨入昌明途徑。以較我國人普遍於大減價·大拍賣·足尺加三·照碼對折·等類無意識之廣吿，直不可同日語。茲錄誌外人奇妙廣吿數事，爲國人改良設計之法則。</p>
<p>英有雜售百貨之肆，某日於日報刋一廣吿，曰成婚新法。法以肆所售物·列分爲二，一限售給男子，一限售給女子，每份編號，以若干萬爲額。定某號爲彩，俟數售罄，由肆中查明男女同得此彩號者，即爲介紹撮合，成爲夫婦，並備巨萬奩資贈之。如不能配合，即以奩資分給兩方。以是遠近購物者雲集；數盡後，因男女年齡不當，分贈奩資，如是三次，卒有兩男女相合成婚，該肆獲利無算。</p>
<p>另一肆見而羨之，亦刋一廣吿曰；敝肆有一女，年方及　，容華絶代，擬求良匹，凡有意求耦者，請即來肆晤面，以便審擇。見之者遂亦相率詣肆。至則果有女子立門首，與來賓一一握手爲禮，此往彼來，戶限爲穿，惟來者不能旋到即去·多藉購物俄延有頃。該肆旣利市百倍，年餘續刋廣吿曰；女子閱人多，鮮當意者，求耦事即作罷論。</p>
<p>某人以失戀情侶，悲憤自殺。一售槍肆聞之，亟覔水木明森風景宜人之地，爲營白石墓表，大書曰；［用某肆最新式手槍自殺之某君，］下即詳細點綴此事。遊人經此，莫不注目，某肆之名大彰，生涯遂鼎盛。</p>

<p>孫總理小吃苦頭縣老爺大吿奮勇</p>
<p>去年夏天患的是水災，今年夏天患的是旱災。在旱災聲中，我接到幼妹在家中寄來一信。照錄如下：</p>
<p>［潛哥：</p>
<p>……我現在吿訴你一件新近的事體。Ｘ</p>
<p>縣因爲天久未雨和瘟疫的流行，大家想一種正當的方法來避免，這方法是縣長和全縣人民共同籌劃的。這種方法是什麽呢？恐怕你也想不出。丨原來他們發起了一個［會］，規定全縣人民焚香吃素，城門關閉三天，縣長大老爺每天薰洗沐浴，到四城去磕頭求雨，並將城隍菩薩搬出游行四門，縣長在後面壓隊。這也罷了，最可惡的，就是我們孫總理的像也背在城隍菩薩後面，抬着滿城走，在訓政的時期居然訓出這樣的花頭，我爲中國悲！孫總理的主義沒行，先被人家當做［偶像］了！……</p>
<p>還有許多感慨的話，現在不錄。至於Ｘ縣位在皖省Ｘ湖之邊，似乎不至於旱。然而水利不興，河流不濬，童山秃秃，毫無森林之培養，所謂科學知識，縣老爺黨老爺們恐怕侑夢了想不到，那能不旱呢？</p>

<p>— 江紅蕉</p>
<p>王先生也住在這鎭上，離開袁芬若的住處只有一條街。他已五十六歲，也鰥居着，他的兒女們也都死掉，他常常感到鰥居的凄凉，有時遇到傷風咳嗽，或者是腰背酸痛不能起床的時候，尤其覺得孤零。他廻念到昔日家庭的樂趣，偶然也還感到性的苦悶，他很有意再找一個相當的婦人作爲老來的配偶。但是他很窮，而且年齡已過結婚期太遠，他很失望，知道没有什麽婦人，願意嫁給他做妻子。</p>
<p>但是他很屬意於余芬若，他想不出用什麽方法，可以探出伊是否願意再醮，是否願意嫁一個窮苦的老頭兒。他在每一次到伊家裏去發放或收取繡貨的時候，仔細注意到伊的一切。覺得伊雖然是四十來歲的婦人，只穿些很樸素的布服，但是伊的面容，似乎還不曾把年輕時的嬌媚端麗，完全老去，伊的家裏，沒有什麽好的傢具，但是收拾得很整齊而清潔，伊對待不相干的瘋子，很溫厚體貼，心腸是很好的。什麽都合於王先生所要娶一個再醮婦的條件了，但是伊剌繡着所得的工資，足以養活伊自已一個人，還能瞻顧到袁瘋子的生活。伊很莊重，生活不恐慌，很平穩地過着日子，不需要再醮。王先生曾試過好幾次，把伊的工資算錯多給伊二角，但是伊算學也很好，把多付的退還了王先生；有時在上海買些肥皂，毛巾，白糖之類去送給伊，伊只些微的領受一部份，但是伊買了價値相等的東西送還給王先生；並且向王先生聲明，請不要再送東西，否則無力答報，惟有一槪璧謝。王先生的心事，是不能達目的，却也並不從此恨伊，反很敬重伊。</p>
<p>余芬若的和善，是任何人都知道的；袁瘋子的瘋態，是全鎭都憎厭的。袁瘋子在瘋的時候，無端會打人的巴掌，無端會咀咒年輕婦人將成孤孀，或者駡年輕的姑娘偷漢子，或者强拉着警察說伊的丈夫，所以無人不恨伊，怒伊想打伊；但是余芬若知道了，一定去代伊懇情道歉，人家一聽了余芬若的話，便息怒而無事。警察局屢次要抓伊送進瘋人院去，也都由芬若去勸止。袁瘋子在瘋的時候，芬若常把伊的瘋狀告訴伊，伊才知道自已在瘋的時候，得罪了许多人，伊很感激芬若是這樣的看護伊，否則也許會被人打死，或者被人捉到了瘋人院裏。</p>

<p>— 陶小桃</p>
<p>物理化學和製造的稿件，諸位已經看了很多了，做了很多了，現在我來和諸位談談與人接近點的礦物：</p>
<p>平常所見的砂礫，高山上的岩石塊，都是石英（Ｇuartz）所成的東西。石英分佈得很廣，也是我們日常見的礦物，牠的用處非常大，可帮近視眼和遠視看見東西，以及做印章裝飾之用，現將牠介紹在下面：</p>
<p>石英的結晶體成六角柱或六角錐形，牠的質地極硬，難以溶化，通常以氫氧火熖發出很高的熱度，才能將牠溶化了，溶化後成爲和玻璃般的液體，也可以抽成絲狀，製成各式的化學器械，如燒瓶，漏斗，坩堝等，以及光學儀器如透鏡等，製成的東西是遠勝於用玻璃製造成的，可是牠和玻璃製成的器械很不容易分别出來，大凡玻璃製成的東西中間總不免有泡沬的痕迹，可是純粹石英製的中間，則沒有泡沬的痕迹，其牠尙有硬度的，比重的鑑别法，可是要破壞物件才試得出，牠是不爲一旦酸類所溶解，但是無定形的石英能溶於氟氫酸（Hydrofluoric　acid），結晶的溶解於氟氫酸和硝酸的混合液中。牠是氧和矽化合而成的。因爲内含雜質很多，所以大至分爲三類，現將牠分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）水晶</p>
<p>水晶是毫無雜質的石英，無色透明如玻璃，就是所謂製光學儀器，化學器械者，製成的雖遠勝玻璃製成的，可是價値可貴多了。有許多有色的水晶怎樣成的呢含有錳（Manganess）的呈紫色。</p>
<p>含有鑽（Titanium）的呈紅色·含有炭素的呈灰色。這種水晶常簇生於岩石中，或礦山的脈絡間。</p>
<p>（二）燧石及瑪瑙</p>
<p>燧石就是土名所謂火石者，以牠磨擦可以發火而得名，瑪瑙是一種半透明的石英，上有美麗的條紋，這是因爲和同類的碧玉，玉體等相重疊的緣故。</p>
<p>（三）蛋白石</p>
<p>蛋白石是一種不透明，不結晶的石英，因爲他含有水分所以沒有水晶，燧石，瑪瑙那樣堅固，很容易折斷，呈褐色或乳白色，把蛋白石琢磨而成很好的裝飾品。</p>
<p>改良社會討論會</p>
<h3 id="c225">宴會上應改良之點 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 歐陽錦屛女士</p>
<p>宴會，小事也，然亦有改良之處，特不爲吾人所留意耳，略書於後，以供本討</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>論會同志之採納。</p>
<p>（一）謹守時刻　西人作事，最重時刻，故有［時者金也］之語，我國人宴客，視請帖上規定之鐘點，爲一種具文，每見主人本定七時入席，而賓朋則八時，九時，始施施前來，致他客枯坐以待，主人亦腹枵神疲，容色不悅，殊非賓主聯歡之道。</p>
<p>（二）革除猜拳　赴宴會之賓客，當酒酣耳熱之餘，大事猜拳，喧嘩怒吼，如狂如疾，隔座爲之中斷談話，女賓望而却步，此種陋習，亟應改良，座中而爲商界，不妨談談商情，學界則討論學術可已，何必多此猜拳一舉哉，</p>
<p>（三）戒强人飲酒　先聖有言，［惟酒無量，不及亂。］恒見席間實客，對於同儕不善飲者，以野蠻之手段，强其使醉，醉後或肆漫駡，或兇毆他人，怪狀百出，旁觀引以爲笑樂，不幸而酒性暴發，血管更有破裂之虞，願吾人急革除之。</p>
<p>（四）宜具指導禮貌之責任　携兒女赴宴，則爲之長者，當訓之以禮儀，庶無爭食打架，擾亂座位秩序等事發生，他若［並坐不横肱。］［碗箸勿狼藉。］均應隨時指導，以改良兒童之個性。而免貽笑大方。</p>
<p>（五）注意簽寫請客單　主人設宴，恒視請客單上所列之佳賓若干，而預定酒席之多少，故凡屬賓客。當到則簽［到］字；如確有要事不能到者，可簽［敬謝］或［不到］等字，每見社會人士，於請客單上，祗書一［知］字，其到與否，主人莫得而决定之也，於預排酒席方面，豈不太麻煩耶，有被請赴宴資格者，其注意改良小小之簽字手續。</p>

<p>— 阜民</p>
<p>打！忽然在衖口起了一片喝打聲，在喝聲之外還雜有尖銳的女人的駡聲，</p>
<p>跑出門一看，祇見一大羣的人像潮水一般擁着本里中最神氣的ＸＸＸ大律師往後而去了，</p>
<p>在本里的派出所前面人羣站住了，兩個人扭着大律師進了狹小的警察休息室，在所長前面各訴說他們的理由，原委，</p>
<p>同時站在門外候等的羣衆開始他們的宣傳工作，他們向旁邊站着看的訪事們吿訴，</p>
<p>他們是閘北ＸＸ路ＸＸ和ＸＸ里的房客，在戰前的房租是十一元四角，因爲地處戰區，經過戰事以後，當然也不會例外的受到相當的損失，戰事完了，房東修理房屋，就要加租，由十一元四角，一躍而爲二十二元，房客無力付租，他（律師）就派人丢家具，也不管屋裏有沒有人，打開了門丢，</p>
<p>［哼！他自已的房子要減租免租，别人的房子就要加租，豈有此理！］一個胖婦人叉着腰唾沬亂噴地說道，</p>
<p>［非敎伊登報聲明不可！］一個赤着膊凸着大肚子的胖子握着拳揚着臂說，　　［噪那！對末對，勿對打仔一頓再話，］一個歪戴着草帽的朋友摩拳擦掌地說，</p>
<p>因爲事情重大，所長不能解决，所以送到總局去，談判的人出來了，在大律師的旁邊叉添了四個警察，走到律師住所支衖的地方，大律師便往裏一鑽，到家裏去了，羣衆想追逐上去抓住他，被管門的攔住了，於是起了反動了，</p>
<p>冲！一片呐喊聲，後面的人推着前面的人，前面的人怕吃棒頭，反身向人叢中鑽去，四個警察跑來，把他們鎭住了，</p>
<p>好一會，大律師坐了汽車出來了，管門的做先鋒，拿了一根籐條在車前開路，嚇得羣衆不敢上前阻攔，同時車旁扶了許多人了這些人在表面上看來和閒人一般，其實都是他的門下客，好容易，殺開一條路，汽車嗚嗚地冲出衖外先向總局奔馳而去，隨後，羣衆也蜂擁而去了，</p>
<p>後來，聽說把二十一個房客押了起來，大律師却照樣無事的出來了，</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3 id="c227">原來如此 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 修葉</p>
<p>新近從學校裏回來，忽然看到我們弄堂口在我幾隻熱悉的面孔之外又多了一批長旗袍高跟皮鞋的窈窕淑女們底倩影，問一問家裏人纔知道新近我們弄口搬來了一隻ＸＸ女子師範學校，而這些長旗袍高跟皮鞋的主人們便是該校底高材生，</p>
<p>ＸＸ女子師範學校這名字，我在十年前做小學生時就常常聽見到了，不，不如說是看見到了，因爲，每學期開始時我們弄口牆上在［姚佐頓］［雙鵲］等招紙之外一定會多兩張她們的招生廣吿；有時，我們門縫裏也會塞進張把介紹Ｘ人……學費减半，以示優待的她們的傳單，聽說現在學生有兩三百呢，你　弄堂口不是有一塊斗大字的招牌嗎？家裏人吿訴我，眞的，弄堂口的一塊大招牌大得很可以把我們弄堂名字ＸＸ里三個字都給遮掉了</p>
<p>這所學校佔着我們弄堂口第一所第二所兩宅房子：它的大門是沿馬路的，而它的本身是弄堂房子，所以這所學校已算是介在馬路學堂和弄堂學堂之間的了，雖然房子不大，而除了做敎室和女先生的臥室外，倒也附設有女生寄宿舍，不過祇限於年齡大的學生，大槪因爲小的學生要費人手脚照管吧，</p>
<p>晩上我走過她們口時常常看見有陋個少女們在門口說笑，同時在對面階沿上也常常有内穿西裝褲外罩布長衫的少男們在徘徊着，昨天晚上從電影院回來，正走到離家不遠時，忽然看見我們弄堂口聚立着一羣人，大槪弄堂裏又出了什麽大小姐尋死，老闆娘捲逃等事了吧，我默默地想着，同時脚下加緊了步子，</p>
<p>一走近了，纔看清楚了人是都聚在那學校的門口，學校的門是大開着，門口有不少人擠進擠出，跟着大衆的視線看去，在那塊斗大字的招牌上我又發現了一塊新招牌，雪亮金漆的金字招牌附設ＸＸ夜校ＸＸ專修科，老王，那穿紅旗袍蘋菓臉樣也住宿在内啊，不然誰又高興化八隻洋還要每晩去走一趟，上課前早到刻把鐘，適當她們吃好夜飯，慢慢地進攻，樂在其中矣，身旁人堆裏一個戴四百度近視眼鏡的青年在向他同伴數說着，我再細細一看，原來一向在對面階沿上徘徊樣幾位同志們都在這裏全體出席，人人手裏拿着一張報名書，</p>
<p>喔，原來如此，</p>

<p>某姓家昨日來一西裝男子，年四十左右，求見男東家，傭人回言不在家，乃要紙筆各一，上書某旅社某號某某人，將行又止，</p>
<p>求見主婦，下人即取條上禀女主人，主婦意爲有要事，即下樓相見，西裝男子即稱師母，謂因打電報少四元，乞相借，婦見生客，奇甚，然旣是丈夫友人，自當一借，即取一五元票予之，稱謝而去，且云將於是晩六時奉回，</p>
<p>及至六時，不見彼人來，心始疑惑，良人歸家，亦不認有此友，始知爲騙子，此時非但財失，且受牀第呶呶埋怨聲，悔恨不已，（却酬）</p>

<p>姓張姓王的婦人，她倆都沒受過敎育的人，平時喜談空話，往往無風生浪　　一日姓張的得了微恙，挽姓王的相陪到□□路□醫生去看，</p>
<p>她倆一路談談笑笑，到了醫室，掛了號，醫生在她手面上按脈的時候，她倆無緣無故，又大談起來了，旗袍要做幾尺長！領頭要做幾寸高……………可算漂亮呀，好倆談得津津有味，忘記是來看病的。</p>
<p>喂！藥方開好了，快拿去，醫生不耐煩地的說，</p>
<p>她倆被這一喊，方始息了談話，匆匆拿了藥方，到□藥店去買藥。</p>
<p>喂！先生，買一帖藥，姓張的說。</p>
<p>藥店夥計拿着方紙，看了一看，神氣活現的說，你不要弄差，此地是藥店呀。</p>
<p>先生，對呀！我是來買藥的，姓張的似回答地的說。</p>
<p>這張紙頭上，寫是衣裳尺寸，那裏是藥方呢，藥店夥計皺着眉頭說，</p>
<p>咦！奇怪了·姓張的呆了一呆的說。</p>
<p>醫生，我是請你看病開藥方的，你怎麽寫起衣裳尺寸來呢，你不要尋開心呀，姓張的薄怒含嗔的說。</p>
<p>看病的時候，你們談些什麽呀，醫生微笑地的回說。</p>
<p>後來，她倆自知差了，懇求醫生從新開好藥方，去買藥了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The So-Called Self-Defense of the Japanese <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yuan</p>
<p>From the very beginning of the Japanese army's occupation of the Northeast, they have used the excuse of self-defense. This time, Foreign Minister Uchida, in his speech to the Diet, still spoke of the right of self-defense. Recently, concerning the serious situation in the Yangtze River area, it has been said that the Japanese will take necessary self-defense actions if they are compelled to do so. We truly do not know how they define self-defense. There are many in our country who refute the Japanese claim of self-defense, but the Japanese have not been moved in the slightest. Now we will again cite a passage from Major Ishimaru, a well-known figure in the Japanese military, to admonish them on the right of self-defense, and present it to the Japanese authorities and those around the world who are concerned about the Far Eastern situation. Is there any reason to deny his argument? His words are:</p>
<p>"Our Japanese army, with the speed of a galloping horse, occupied key points along the South Manchurian Railway line, such as Fengtian (Shenyang), Changchun, Kuanchengzi, Nanling, Andong, Fenghuangcheng, Yingkou, Fushun, and Gongzhuling, in a single day. I cannot help but wonder, where will our army's unlimited occupation end? Unlimited occupation goes beyond the scope of the right of self-defense. Dr. Tatsukichi Minobe, an authority on international law, stated regarding the right of self-defense: 'Country A may enter the territory of Country B, interfering with Country B's sovereign power, as an act of self-defense. However, in strict legal theory, the following conditions must be met: (1) The harm suffered by the country itself, its organs, or its subjects is imminent; (2) Other means cannot achieve the goal of removing the harm, and it is necessary to use this means to remove the harm; (3) The act of removing the harm must not exceed the degree necessary to remove the harm; (4) The harm does not arise from the act of the country engaging in self-defense, nor from the illegal acts of its organs. It is only when necessary for self-defense that a state of war may sometimes be entered into. Therefore, pure legal theory does not allow the country exercising the right of self-defense to freely decide whether or not to invoke the right of self-defense. If it is deemed that the above conditions are not met, Country B may not recognize Country A's invocation of the right of self-defense.'"</p>
<p>The above is Major Ishimaru's correction of the Japanese claim of self-defense, focusing only on the point of exceeding its scope. From this, it can already be seen that the Japanese so-called self-defense cannot be justified. If it is further explained based on Dr. Minobe's legal theory, their argument becomes even more untenable. First, Japan, its state organs, and us are separated by vast oceans, making it impossible to cause harm. As for Japanese subjects residing in our country, we have never harmed them. If the Nakamura Incident is used as an excuse, while there was indeed a Nakamura, he disguised himself as a merchant and did not carry a travel passport, engaging purely in espionage. How can we be blamed for failing to provide adequate protection and thus be accused of causing harm? As for the dismantling of the South Manchurian Railway, it is a fabrication by the Japanese. Since there is no harm, how can there be any urgency? Second, even if the Wanbaoshan Incident is considered recent persecution, the matter is already in the past. Issues such as commercial lease rights are treaty disputes that can be resolved by seeking remedies from international arbitration bodies. Why would it be deemed that the goal cannot be achieved without the use of force? Third, conceding even further, if we accept the Japanese military's claim that there are actions in the Liaoning area that harm the Japanese, then the removal of harm should be limited to Liaoning. Why occupy key points in both Liaoning and Jilin provinces in a single day, and then proceed to organize a puppet state to gradually achieve their plan of annexation? This exceeds the necessary degree of self-defense by thousands of miles. Fourth, the current serious situation in the Northeast is entirely the result of illegal actions by the Japanese army. Therefore, the use of force cannot be justified. Thus, based on the four points discussed by Major Ishimaru using Dr. Minobe's theory, the Japanese claim of self-defense has absolutely no basis. Yet today, the Japanese still shamelessly promote self-defense, as if any action can be disguised by the word "self-defense." Legal self-defense does not allow the country exercising self-defense to freely decide, but they believe that everything can be freely decided at will. The exercise of legal self-defense must have certain limitations and cannot exceed the scope, but they believe that everything can be exercised arbitrarily without any limitations or scruples. If the Japanese hold this concept of self-defense to deal with China and all future East Asian affairs, then, as Major Ishimaru said, it will be a cause for concern for the future world. I wonder if the League of Nations investigation team has paid attention to this point?</p>

<h3 id="e2">Volunteer Army Attacked Shenyang Again Yesterday Morning <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Surrounding the Arsenal and Engaging with the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Fighting in Fushun, Two Japanese Captured</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Around midnight on the 31st, approximately 500 volunteer soldiers attacked the Shenyang Arsenal and the city again. The battle continued until this morning. It is reported that the attack on the arsenal caused significant damage, with many Japanese soldiers killed and wounded. The Kwantung Army is extremely embarrassed and has repeatedly sent urgent messages to the mainland provinces, requesting reinforcements. The morale in the city is shaken, and the Japanese and collaborators are at a loss. It is feared that there will be unrest among the residents of the city within days. (1st, China United News)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The volunteer army in the suburbs of Shenyang is still engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. Plainclothes soldiers from the volunteer army are distributing leaflets in Shenyang, claiming that they will recover Shenyang during the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. The Liutiao Lake railway tracks have been destroyed by the volunteer army. The puppet Fengshan Railway trains now depart from Huangshutun instead of Shenyang. Armed cars have been added to the trains starting today, with a large number of Japanese soldiers accompanying them. The Japanese military and police are strictly prohibiting the families of puppet state officials from fleeing to Dalian and Changchun. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) The volunteer army that attacked the arsenal was repelled by the Japanese army by 3:00 AM today. However, several new units of volunteer soldiers have arrived from various directions outside Shenyang City, including Xiaobazitian, Huacun, and Nantag, launching a fierce artillery attack and engaging in battle with the Japanese garrison. These volunteer soldiers belong to the factions of Lin Zizhang and Yanzi, who attacked Shenyang City the day before, numbering approximately 700. (1st, Dentsu News)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) At 0:30 AM on the 1st, approximately 500 volunteer soldiers attacked Shenyang again. One unit surrounded the arsenal outside the Dadongmen and clashed with the Japanese garrison and police. Another unit, targeting Shenyang City from the Dananmen, launched an attack on the Japanese XXX unit, the military police, and the [Manchukuo] police force. Upon hearing the news, they mobilized and engaged in a fierce battle for two hours. The volunteer army retreated towards the southeast of Shenyang. (1st, Dentsu News)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) At 4:30 AM on the 1st, the volunteer army that attacked Shenyang again began to retreat towards Tongliao and Dunhua due to attacks by the Japanese and Manchukuo military and police. At 4:00 AM, the Japanese air force coordinated with the army and bombed the retreating volunteer army from the air, causing heavy losses to the volunteer army. (1st, Dentsu News)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Communication with the Anda Area is Cut Off <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Qiqihar On the 28th, 4,000 volunteer soldiers attacked and occupied the Anda Station on the Chinese Eastern Railway. After receiving the urgent report, the Kameyama unit mobilized to the area on the morning of the 29th. Due to the disruption of communication, details are unknown. (1st, Dentsu News)</p>
<h3 id="e4">1,000 Volunteer Soldiers Attack Fushun <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Shenyang) Approximately 1,000 volunteer soldiers led by Li Binrun, the commander of the Sixth Route Army of the Northeastern People's Volunteer Army, which moved south along the Feng-Hai Line and approached Fushun, attacked Dongshelia (approximately 2 li east of Fushun) on the Feng-Hai Railway last night. The Fushun Public Security Team mobilized, but was outnumbered and suffered a major defeat. Ugaidasuke, the chief of the Fushun Police Affairs Office, Kiyota, a first-class soldier of the military police, Du, the chief of the Central Section, and He, the chief of the 5th Detachment of the Public Security Team, were all captured by the volunteer army. Just as these five men were about to be executed by the volunteer army, Kiyota broke free from his ropes and jumped into the Hun River, floating downstream for approximately 3 li. He reached the garrison this morning at 2:00 AM and urgently reported the situation. The Japanese garrison immediately mobilized, tied them up, and rescued Chief Du and the others. However, Ugaidasuke was taken away, and according to Kiyota, Ugaidasuke has likely been killed. (1st, Dentsu News)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yang Shengshan, the brigade commander of the 10th Route Army of the Volunteer Army, led over 1,000 troops from Chaoyangsi to Baiqibao, between Jin Dong Goubangzi, on the 27th, and made contact with the enemy. Due to a lack of ammunition, they cut off the road. They are currently still in a stalemate with the enemy. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Most of the Essence of Haicheng Destroyed <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a Shenyang report, the Volunteer Army attacked Haicheng on the 26th, and there was a fierce battle for a long time. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. Overseas Chinese have moved to the South Manchurian Railway station area. The buildings were severely damaged, and most of the essence of Haicheng was destroyed. The Volunteer Army is targeting the stations along the South Manchurian Railway and will continue to attack the stations. (1st, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Shenyang Battle Report Recorded by the Japanese Newspaper <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun published a detailed report today by its special correspondent regarding the repeated attacks on Shenyang by 5,000 volunteer soldiers. Later, the Ministry of the Army issued a statement denying the reported details, stating that there was no major battle in Shenyang as described by the Asahi Shimbun. However, the Ministry of the Army acknowledged that there were minor clashes in the outskirts of Shenyang yesterday, stating that several hundred disbanded soldiers were found in a certain area and were driven away. The Asahi Shimbun's report is likely reliable, stating that the volunteer army carried machine guns and mortars, and its main objective was to attack the arsenal, airfield, and radio station. Other newspapers and news agencies have not published any reports of the battle as reported by the Asahi Shimbun. (1st, Reuters)</p>

<p>(Beiping) According to some sources, the main parts of the conclusion of the Investigation Team's report are as follows: (1) The Investigation Team believes that it is best for China and Japan to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue, including the Manchurian issue, through direct negotiations. (2) Although the League of Nations and third countries will not participate in these direct negotiations, the League of Nations will monitor the progress and conclusion of the direct negotiations.

He will return to Japan on the 3rd from Tanggu on the Chang'an Maru. After reporting to the government, he will go to Geneva. Regarding the conclusion of the report, Shiozaki told people that the content of the conclusion discussion is strictly confidential and cannot be found out. However, since it is necessary to maintain Japan's face, not harm China's face, and also express the League of Nations' greatest efforts for international peace, the greatest efforts have been made to make these three parties satisfactory. Therefore, intense debate is inevitable. The decision on the conclusion is being drafted today and can be completed tomorrow first. The conclusion of the report is a solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute, obtained from the special situation of the Manchurian Incident and the special relationship between Japan and Manchuria. It is an exceptional situation in international law, or it may set a new precedent. Previous reports on observing quietly for a period or the trusteeship case are all things of the past. The focus of the current report's conclusion is on adjusting the relationship between the League of Nations and China and Japan. Although the conclusion is not limited to being beneficial to Japan, the majority of the Investigation Team does not seem to have considered the concern of inducing a direct conflict between Japan and the League of Nations as a result.

<p>Rumors of Arsenals Manufacturing Weapons Day and Night</p>
<p>Military Action Against Jehol Likely Unavoidable</p>
<p>Young Military Officers Advocate Declaring War on Russia</p>
<p>▲Reuters Tokyo dispatch, August 28. Although anti-Japanese movements in China have intensified again recently, Japanese newspapers and citizens have shown no particular reaction. Japanese officials say that although news from China claims that the situation is quite serious, they believe that this situation is unlikely to change significantly. Japan does not seem to have any need to dispatch troops to Shanghai again. However, if something unexpected happens that requires Japan to take drastic measures, Japan seems unlikely to repeat the mistakes it made in Shanghai this spring. It will act cautiously to avoid causing international disputes, because any action in Shanghai will inevitably lead to such disputes. Therefore, if Japan deems it necessary to take direct action this time, it will choose Nanjing over Shanghai. At the same time, the Japanese army will not participate; the navy will handle it alone. Although there are rumors that the Japanese army will take action in mainland China, in fact, the Japanese army has no intention of getting involved. A small-scale naval operation on the Yangtze River is one thing, but the army's action on the mainland (excluding Manchuria and Mongolia) is another. Because of the vastness of Chinese territory,</p>

<h3 id="e73">Receiving Foreign Important Telegrams <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>if military action does begin, it is difficult to predict what changes will occur in the future, and it is also impossible to rule out disputes with other countries as a result. For these reasons, rumors that the Japanese army will invade China and occupy North China are unfounded. At a time when Japan is hoping that the Jehol problem can be resolved peacefully, rumors suddenly spread that arsenals throughout Japan are now stepping up the manufacture of weapons day and night. It is feared that this statement is as baseless as the rumors that the Japanese army concentrated in Taiwan during the Shanghai war this spring. Even if this were true, it could not immediately be said to be evidence of Japanese aggression against China. Rather than saying that the Japanese army is aggressing against China, it is more accurate to say that it is a kind of preparation by Japan to prevent emergencies. Because on the one hand, Japan is expressing its unease about the potential outcome of the upcoming discussions on the Manchurian problem in Geneva, and on the other hand, it must prepare for the possibility of war with Soviet Russia over the Sino-Eastern Railway and Mongolian problems. This is why it is preparing. Young members of the Japanese military are advocating declaring war on Russia in the near future. They believe that if Japan does not act immediately, it will be unable to compete with Soviet Russia in Manchuria after Russia completes its second five-year plan, and will inevitably succumb. However, older and responsible members of the military are opposed to this proposal and are trying to restrain these young officers, because they are unwilling to start a war with Soviet Russia due to Japan's financial situation and other reasons. Although it is difficult to determine whether the above statements are true, they cannot be dismissed as mere rumors.</p>

<p>▲TASS, Amsterdam, September 1. The declaration adopted by the International Anti-Imperialist War Congress will be printed in multiple languages and distributed to millions of people around the world. The declaration points out that in the current political situation, any imperialist war will inevitably affect the entire world. It also states that imperialist governments regard the Soviet Union as a common enemy that must be eliminated. This attitude can be seen from the past joint armed intervention and the continued supply of weapons to White Russian elements in Europe and the United States, to the deliberate sabotage or fabrication of slander against the Soviet Union. At the same time, the declaration claims that the Soviet Union has consistently and systematically maintained its policy of peace and refuted the imperialist fabrication of the "Red Imperialism" rumor, believing that this kind of rumor can only serve as a pretext for attacking the Soviet Union. The declaration points out that all imperialist countries, especially Britain, France, and Italy, are preparing for war in a frenzy, and France is at the forefront of organizing the war, hoping to unite the countries of Europe into an anti-Soviet group and have them under its command. It continues, under this phenomenon, the only way to prevent a global explosion is for the working farmers, intellectuals, and all oppressed nations to unite and act together in opposition. The declaration also warns official organizations such as the League of Nations, saying that while they verbally advocate peace, they are actually a weapon used by imperialists to carry out war conspiracies. Finally, the declaration calls on the masses to use an unremitting spirit of struggle to oppose imperialist wars, protect the Soviet Union, which is engaged in socialist construction, oppose the partition of China, and assist the colonial peoples who are fighting against imperialism. The declaration was signed by 2,195 representatives attending the conference, with an added note stating that the signatories will do their best to arouse the enthusiasm of the people for anti-imperialist war. According to the analysis of the occupation and party affiliation of the delegates attending the conference, 1,865 were workers, 72 were farmers, and the rest were intellectuals. In terms of party affiliation, 830 belonged to their party, 291 to the Social Democratic Party, 24 to the German and Dutch Workers' Socialist Party, and another 35 were representatives of various bourgeois political parties.

<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, September 1. Local newspapers frequently carry alarming news about the Manchurian incident, causing public panic. Army Minister Araki spoke in the House of Representatives this afternoon to dispel this panic, reporting on the military situation in Manchuria, saying that Zhang Xueliang's party has recently been engaged in restoration activities and colluding with communist elements to disrupt security and order, but that the number of people involved and the scope of their activities are overstated by the Japanese newspapers. He is confident that Japan has no need to send additional reinforcements to Manchuria. The main points of Araki's speech are as follows: (1) The Japanese authorities have not adopted effective measures to deal with Zhang Xueliang's party's activities in Jehol, fearing that this would cause serious international disputes, but he hopes that the Jehol problem can be resolved satisfactorily soon. (2) Although the area of military operations in Manchuria is vast, and there are difficulties in terms of geography and weather, the Japanese army's work in Manchuria is progressing smoothly everywhere. (3) During the attack on the Shenyang airfield on August 29, 13 of the aircraft seized previously were destroyed. There were no Japanese casualties or damage in the Shenyang fighting on the night of August 31. (4) There are various reasons to believe that Ma Zhanshan died in battle on July 29.</p>

<p>▲United Press, Tokyo, September 1st – The Seiyukai's anti-government fervor has suddenly reached a high point.

<p>▲United Press, Tokyo, September 1st – Prime Minister Saito visited Speaker Tokugawa of the Upper House and members of various factions of the committee around 9:00 AM today, earnestly requesting their help with the government and to quickly conclude the bill. The study group expressed considerable sympathy for the government and intends to formulate a compromise regarding the Rice Law, so that both the government and the Seiyukai can save face. The proposed solutions are: (1) The Seiyukai advocates removing the provision on the proportional rice price from the Rice Law, which the government opposes. The Upper House will change this to temporarily suspend the proportional rice price clause. (2) Stipulate the actual amount for purchasing rice prices based on production costs.</p>

<p>Content Leaked in Advance</p>
<p>Causing German Resentment</p>
<p>▲Kokumin, Berlin, August 31st – Political circles today confirmed that the government has sent a note to French Ambassador Ponsot, demanding Germany's right to equal armament. It is reported that the document informs France that Germany is willing to reorganize its army according to its economic and practical needs. This likely involves reducing the conscription period from twelve to six years, reducing the cavalry to increase other troops, and being allowed to build fortresses on the eastern border. It is said that Germany's continued participation in the Geneva Disarmament Conference depends entirely on the outcome of negotiations between French Ambassador Ponsot and German Foreign Minister Neurath on this issue.</p>
<p>▲Kokumin, Berlin, September 1st – According to sources in Paris, the secret document in which German Foreign Minister Neurath asked French Ambassador Ponsot in Berlin to convey to French Prime Minister Herriot the demand for German armament equality, was leaked by the French Foreign Ministry before it was even delivered. German political and diplomatic circles are deeply angered by this. The leaker apparently intended to stir up French public opinion against Germany and prevent the German and French authorities from continuing secret discussions on this issue, and to exaggerate the matter. In fact, the content of the document had already been a topic of multiple discussions between German and French representatives in the final stages of the Geneva Disarmament Conference. German and British cabinet members and diplomats had also discussed this matter at conferences in Lausanne, Geneva, Paris, and London. Germany maintains that all countries that signed the Treaty of Versailles should uniformly implement disarmament in accordance with the treaty. Germany's demand for armament equality is not intended to reach the limits set by other countries, but for the sake of national security, it hopes that the disarmament of other countries will reach Germany's limits. German politicians have long expressed this wish to the world, and it is not a new development. Therefore, France has no need to be alarmed by Germany's recent actions.</p>

<p>Negotiations Continue Between Nationalist Socialist Party and Centre Party</p>
<p>The Outcome of the Struggle with the Government Will Be Revealed Next Week</p>
<p>▲Kokumin, Berlin, August 31st – Although the atmosphere in the political situation today is relatively calm, one cannot say that the severity of the storm has lessened. The date of President Hindenburg's return to the capital has not yet been determined, but it is generally expected that the new speaker of the Reichstag, Göring, will meet with the president before the Reichstag reconvenes next week. At that time, the state of the struggle between the Reichstag and the von Papen government will become clear. Based on the current situation, if the Reichstag insists on obstructing the cabinet's economic reform plans, President Hindenburg will certainly not heed the Reichstag speaker's request, as is generally expected.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Berlin, September 1st – The German Reichstag is scheduled to open on September 8th to hear Prime Minister von Papen's political program. It is generally expected that the Reichstag will be adjourned indefinitely, avoiding dissolution and allowing the Nationalist Socialist Party and the Centre Party to continue their negotiations at their leisure. Although the two parties have made contact, they are still in the initial stages. However, the Nationalist Socialist Party has proposed a motion opposing emergency decrees, especially the decree establishing temporary courts. The cabinet, however, does not want the parliament to discuss this matter. Therefore, the possibility of the Reichstag's dissolution still exists. The latest act in Germany's entangled political drama involves President Hindenburg's decision to refuse to meet with the speaker and deputy speaker of the Reichstag at his country estate. President Hindenburg stated today that he intends to meet with a delegation from the Reichstag in Berlin sometime next week. The Nationalist Socialist Party and the Centre Party are apprehensive about the president's current decision not to meet with Reichstag representatives, but feel that the door is still open and that they can still work to persuade the president to change his view of the Reichstag. The Nationalist Socialist Party and the Centre Party are confident that they can eventually form a majority party. Some say that this effort is unlikely to succeed, as the president is convinced that the union of the Nationalist Socialist Party and the Centre Party is merely an accidental outcome of party self-interest and does not represent a genuinely valuable political program. At the same time, Prime Minister von Papen has adopted a posture of agreeing to attend the Stahlhelm rally, which is also a demonstration against the Nationalist Socialist Party, as the Stahlhelm is a strong rival to the Nationalist Socialist Party's Sturmabteilung (SA).</p>
<h3 id="e87">Spectacle of Solar Eclipse in the Americas <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>▲Kokumin, Boston, August 31st – There was a total solar eclipse in the New England area of the eastern United States today. Observations varied across regions due to weather conditions. In some places, the weather was clear, so observations were extremely clear. In other places, the sky was obscured by clouds, making observations impossible. Many researchers had organized fifteen solar eclipse observation projects in advance, setting up large instruments in Thetford, Vermont, and Conway, New Hampshire. However, the weather did not cooperate, and the skies in these locations were covered by clouds, resulting in no results. The results of amateur astronomers, however, were better than those of the experts because they were scattered throughout the zone of totality, rather than concentrated in one location. Today's solar eclipse began at 2:04 PM Eastern time, its starting point being the North Pole, gradually moving south, passing through Hudson Bay, the St. Lawrence River, and east of Montreal before entering the northeastern part of the United States. In the United States, it passed through the states of Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts. New York was not within the zone of totality, while Boston was slightly off. Totality occurred at 3:30 PM, the eclipsed area was yellow, and after totality, the color gradually darkened. Chickens and other poultry thought it was evening. However, it was not completely dark, and large characters could be read. The stars were faintly visible in the sky. The total solar eclipse was most beautiful because as the sun was obscured by the moon, a halo emanated from all around. Those parts that extended beyond the moon's shadow were several times longer than the diameter of the sun. Wherever there were valleys and irregularities on the moon's surface, the light would be refracted, varying in length. Sometimes, the red chromosphere would erupt like a raging fire, presenting a wondrous spectacle. However, the moon's arrival was sudden and its departure was swift, lasting only one minute and forty seconds.</p>

<p>Northeast Economy Completely Bankrupt</p>
<p>The Needs and Hopes of the Guerrilla Fighters</p>
<p>Another Derailed Train on the Anfeng Line</p>
<p>Japanese Slaughter Under Newly Agreed Articles</p>
<p>Correspondent from Peiping, visitor from Jilin talks about: (1) Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has been ravaged by the iron heels of Japanese bandits. Farmers cannot farm, merchants cannot trade, and the suffering of the people is beyond description. This year, rural crops have some hope for a good harvest due to favorable rainfall, but many areas along the South Manchurian Railway have been destroyed by Japanese invaders. Moreover, battles occur at any time and place due to the activities of guerrilla fighters. Wealthier villagers, whose economic conditions can be somewhat maintained, have moved to cities to seek refuge. Those who cannot afford it have joined the guerrilla fighters. Currently, it is feared that no one will harvest during the autumn harvest. Urban commerce is declining daily, and large and small stores are closing down one after another. The rural economy and the urban economy have been completely bankrupted by this sudden change. (2) Guerrilla fighters are everywhere, fleeting and unpredictable, constantly engaging the enemy in battle. Their resistance is quite strong, and the national spirit is being awakened. In the three northeastern provinces, apart from a few famous cities where large numbers of Japanese troops are stationed with sophisticated weapons and can barely maintain order, all other villages and towns are under the control of guerrilla fighters. The guerrilla fighters have no salaries, naturally suffering hardships. However, the people have a clear understanding of the guerrilla fighters and maintain close ties, so the guerrilla fighters have the potential for long-term resistance. (3) The people of the Northeast yearn for the Han Chinese more than ever. Two companies of Xi Qia's guards recently mutinied. A certain guard of five companies attacked Wang Dianchen's unit, but because they had no will to fight, Wang seized two howitzers and many rifles, and killed the reverse unit's company commander and deputy company commander. Wang was originally a bandit leader but has now engaged in national salvation work and has about fifteen hundred men. Also, the puppet troops in Changchun are unwilling to wear the [Manchukuo] badge. If they cannot avoid it, they treat it as a sign of being a conquered slave. The city is surrounded by guerrilla fighters, the situation is critical, and the people are panicking. (4) The people of the Northeast, grieving over the national crisis, have risen up in a national salvation movement. Based on observations, the guerrilla fighters have four advantages: (1) They endure hardship and are hardworking. (2) Their marksmanship is accurate. (3) They are familiar with the geography. (4) Their morale is high. However, due to long-term resistance, they urgently need two things: (1) Military and political talents. (2) Economic assistance. At the same time, they hope for two things: (1) That more domestic intellectuals will join the work. (2) That compatriots at home and abroad will provide economic assistance.</p>
<p>Visitor from Shenyang talks about: (1) At 11:00 PM on the 24th of this month, an express train departing from Busan derailed near Diaoyutai around 2:00 AM on the 25th because seven rail spikes had been removed by guerrilla fighters. The entire train derailed at that time and was fired upon. Captain Watanabe of the Japanese Independent Garrison was injured, and several people, including Ikeda, were killed. Seeing that the guerrilla fighters' activities were becoming increasingly fierce and trains were repeatedly derailing, the Japanese authorities have decided to stop some trains in advance. If the situation deteriorates further, they will stop all trains. The following trains are scheduled to be temporarily suspended: the first train between Ryongsan and Busan, the second train to Qiaotou, the sixth train to Benxihu, and the eighth train to Caohekou. As for the third and sixtieth light oil cars, they have been completely stopped. (2) Seeing that the activities of the guerrilla fighters are becoming increasingly serious, the Japanese authorities have forced the puppet state to promulgate two temporary laws for punishing traitors and bandits, purely as an excuse to prepare for the slaughter of our people in the Northeast. The law for punishing traitors has a total of sixteen articles, and the law for bandits has nine articles. The content is extremely cruel, unprecedented in the world. Anyone who violates them will be sentenced to death. The provisions of the two laws are too numerous to list in detail. (3) Since the green gauze tent (referring to the harvest season), the counties have received no revenue. Officials at all levels are showing signs of indolence because they have not received salaries for four months, especially in Faku County. Recently, the county's finance bureau has been unable to support itself due to the huge expenditure on security fees. (August 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e92">The Tragic Situation of the Harbin Flood <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>(Continuation)</p>
<p>The Puppet Authorities Had No Disaster Prevention Preparations From Beginning to End</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers and Police Took the Opportunity to Oppress the Flood Victims</p>
<p>The Entire City Became a Watery Grave, Few Escaped</p>
<p>▲Puppet Officials Talk Empty Words – After the Ma Chuan Kou and Matsuura areas were flooded, people in Harbin thought that the floodwaters were discharged from that direction and that Jiangnan would be spared from danger. However, the floodwaters in Jiangnan did not abate slightly. On the 4th, the puppet Special Zone Administrative Chief Zhang Jinghui invited military, police, and legal entities to a meeting to discuss emergency rescue measures. The leaders of thirty-nine organizations and groups immediately decided to build a two-foot-high brick dam on top of the existing dikes and stack a five-foot-wide layer of sandbags. The funds were to be advanced by the Chamber of Commerce. On the one hand, they sent personnel to inspect the dikes along the Songhua River in Daoli Zhengyanghe at night to see if there were any dangers. If they felt that emergency rescue was necessary, they would also build brick dams and stack sandbags. Although this was passed by the entire meeting at that time, no one responsible supervised the work the next day (the 5th). On that day, the water rose another foot, and only one foot of the brick dam was exposed above the water surface. In the lower areas, there were only eight inches left. The puppet mayor, Bao Guancheng, who loudly advocated organizing a flood prevention committee, continued to do as he pleased and ordered private shipping companies and groups along the river to recruit laborers to block the flood in sections. As a result, they were secretly competing with the various organizations and groups invited by Zhang Jinghui, effectively meaning that neither party was responsible for flood prevention. On the afternoon of the 6th, the floodwaters rose even higher, and only seven inches of the brick dam remained. That night, they received a report from upstream, vaguely stating that a flash flood had erupted in Changbai Mountain, with waves as high as sixteen feet, and had reached Jilin. It would arrive in Harbin in three days. At this point, the merchants began to panic. The Chamber of Commerce also knew that Bao and Zhang were unreliable, so they gathered dozens of firefighters and workers to rush to protect the dike that night. However, the brick dam was thin, and that night it was breached in several places, with water pouring in. The foundation of the stone dam could not withstand the water's impact, and water seeped from under the foundation. By midnight, the floodwaters continued to rise unabated. Apart from the Chamber of Commerce and dozens of workers using old-fashioned methods of filling with soil as the water came, most of the responsible organizations and groups were asleep, with no one caring. At 4:30 AM on the 7th, the river broke through the dike, starting from Guiren in the twelfth district of Daowai.</p>
<p>▲Dike Breach – At 4:25 AM on the 7th, the floodwaters rose and the north wind blew strongly. When the stone dam in the eleventh and twelfth districts of Daowai was built in the past, the supervisor colluded with the contractor, skimping on materials. As a result, the stone materials were not pure, and the water was swept by the wind and temperature with great force. At 4:30 AM, it broke open from under the base of the dam, and the raging waves poured in. Immediately, about five zhang of the dike was destroyed. At that time, seven or eight workers hired by the Chamber of Commerce were standing on the top of the dam and did not have time to run away, resulting in them being swept into the water by the waves and washed away downstream in an instant. After the dike was breached, the fire department immediately sounded the alarm and rang the bell, awakening the citizens. On the one hand, someone suggested quickly going to the nearby flour mill to move flour and throw it into the breach. Chamber of Commerce officials did not make an immediate decision because the cost was relatively high. In the meantime, the floodwaters came like a mountain, and it was no longer possible to cope.</p>
<p>▲Chaos in the City – The water flowed from the eleventh and twelfth districts into the Binjiang North and South markets near the dam, which were originally formed by sediment from the Songhua River and were about a zhang lower than the river surface, so they were flooded first. Because the area east of Sixteenth Street was low-lying, the floodwaters flowed eastward first. In an instant, Twentieth Street was submerged in water. The floodwaters then gradually flowed west through Sixteenth Street. In less than three hours, four-fifths of Daowai was flooded. Around 10:00 AM, the water depth was thirteen to fourteen feet from Sixteenth Street to Twentieth Street, eight feet from Sixteenth Street west to Seventh Street east, and four to five feet from Seventh Street west to First Street east. All the buildings in the city were submerged in water. Most of the two-story buildings east of Sixteenth Street disappeared. The earthen and thatched buildings along the Binjiang River were not visible above the water surface at all. When the fire department sounded the alarm at the time of the dike breach, 200,000 merchants and residents in Daowai were awakened from their sleep. They scrambled to find vehicles and hire people to move their belongings. Zhengyang Street and Xincheng Street were plunged into chaos for a time. Vehicles and pedestrians were crowded along the way, and the cries of the old, the young, and women shook the sky. Traffic at all major intersections was blocked. At this time, the Japanese military police and the troops stationed in Harbin were fully armed and dispatched to guard the streets, prohibiting the flood victims from escaping to Daoli. They were forced to be exposed in the wilderness. Vehicles and horses were in a jumble, and those flood victims who forgot the traffic rules in their panic were beaten in the street. Those who wanted to return to move their belongings and rescue their families were not allowed. The price of vehicles and manpower soared dozens of times in an instant. Flood victims who could not find transportation or who felt sorry for their belongings ran to the roofs, without thinking of escaping. By the afternoon, the floodwaters continued to rise. Large sailboats could be sailed in the city. Merchants and residents who wanted to hire transportation to move their belongings and transport small items still could not easily do so. Even if they found transportation, it was intercepted by the puppet military police with guns to transport the belongings of the puppet chief officials' families. Japanese troops also seized many boats and roamed the city for fun, actually regarding the Chinese people's anxiety in the water or their crouching on the roofs as a source of laughter. Therefore, less than one-tenth of the 200,000 merchants and residents in the city escaped. As for the merchants' goods, none of them were able to move out. The amount of losses is incalculable. In the evening, the Japanese authorities sent additional members of the Retired Soldiers Association, holding weapons to assist the Japanese military and police in guarding the area, claiming to prevent counter-revolutionaries. They did not care about the Chinese people who were trapped in hunger and drowning. (To be continued)</p>
<p>▲Daoli Submerged – After Daowai was submerged, the residents of Daoli were still at ease. The puppet authorities also publicized that they had sent people to supervise the emergency repairs of the dangerous sections of the Zhengyang River dike. The general public still trusted them without doubt. At 11:00 PM on the 7th, the river broke through the Zhengyang River dike, and water poured into the Xin Zhengyang River residential area. Puppet Mayor Bao Guancheng began to show signs of panic. Puppet Administrative Chief Zhang Jinghui was senile and muddleheaded, and did not get the power he wanted, so he turned a blind eye to it. The Japanese authorities also deliberately stood by and watched, with the mentality that drowning all the Chinese people would facilitate the immigration policy. They knew that the water would flood Daoli, so they pretended not to hear and not to see. By the morning of the 8th, water had poured into the Thirty-six Shed, the East Railway Factory, and the Xinanbu area, all of which were flooded. It was only a li away from Daoli's prosperous streets. At this time, Bao Guancheng sent Section Chief Cheng Liuxian of the Public Works Section and Guo Chenggai to spend 100,000 yuan on emergency rescue, supervising the filling of sandbags at various street intersections separately. They organized it in a hurry, and there were no rush sacks to buy, and it was not easy to dig dry soil. Even Liu and Guo colluded to embezzle the money, so they only hired forty or fifty laborers to stack sandbags at the intersection of Xinanbu and Daoli and at the intersection of Thirty-six Shed and Daoli. They knew that the water had already entered the city and the flow was extremely easy. It was better not to block it. After blocking it, it increased the impact force. Therefore, as of noon, the north and south ends of Central Street in Daoli, and the Paotai Street, Gaoshi Street, and Xiewen Street were all turned into watery graves, with a depth of four to five feet in the deep areas and two to three feet in the shallow areas. For a time, residents and shops moved to Nangang, and the chaos was even worse than when Daowai was flooded. In the evening, the water depth in Central Street was four feet, and all traffic was cut off. At this time, the Japanese authorities gradually feared the accusations of consuls from various countries, so they dispatched all the members of the Retired Soldiers Association to assist the flood prevention committee of the puppet municipal bureau in carrying out flood prevention work. However, the disaster had already occurred, and it was difficult to effectively block it. Hirose Kotobuki, the commander of the 10th Division of the Japanese Army stationed in Harbin, was deeply afraid that the guerrillas lurking outside the city would take the opportunity to attack, so he instructed Zhang Jinghui to recommend him to take over the position of Japanese-Manchukuo Garrison Commander, issuing a notice on disaster relief and flood prevention. Bao Guancheng and Zhang Jinghui, according to the wishes of the Japanese authorities, canceled the flood prevention committee of the puppet municipal bureau and formed an emergency committee for the flood disaster. Zhang Jinghui was the president, Li Shaogeng, the director of the East Railway, and Komatsubara, a colonel in the Japanese Special Service Agency, were the vice presidents, Bao Guancheng was the chairman, and Yagi, an advisor to the Special Police Department, was the vice chairman. The committee had eleven internal divisions for planning, flood prevention, accounting, supervision, epidemic prevention, relief, procurement, transportation, propaganda, fundraising, and investigation. Various organizations and groups of the puppet state and Japanese organizations in Harbin sent people to join the work. Only then was there a relatively concrete organization, but the disaster had already occurred. More than 300,000 households of residents and merchants in Daoli were immersed in water.</p>
<p>▲The Tragic Situation of the Flood Victims – Since Daoli continued to be flooded on August 9th, Xincheng Street and Shuidou Street, which were located on high ground, as well as the areas where the Japanese lived, were also several feet deep in water. The entire area of Daoli, except for a few dozen zhang of Xincheng Street and Shuidou Street, was submerged in water. Because the shops had nowhere to move, and they were unable to hire boats for transportation, they built brick dams in front of their doors to prevent the water from rushing in, but the water flowed from the shadows.</p>

<p>Water seeped into cellars, oozed from floorboards, and the indoors were still unavoidably flooded. Those with multi-story buildings took refuge on the second and third floors. Those without buildings either nailed their doors shut, leaving a few people to sit on the rooftops to watch over their property, while the majority of workers sought refuge in Nangang. In Daowai, for eight or nine straight days, the water level continued to rise, submerging the second and third floors of buildings entirely, and many houses collapsed. Well openings were also submerged, causing panic about drinking water. Those who had not been able to escape initially stayed on rooftops, and driven to extremes of hunger and thirst, disregarded the filth and drank the accumulated water from the streets. Obtaining fire was also difficult, so they could not cook food. All small boats had been commandeered by the authorities, and even paying a price of ten-odd dollars to be ferried out of the city was impossible. It was not until the eleventh that the Red Swastika Society, acting from charitable motives, repeatedly pleaded with the Japanese side to agree to seek and hire dozens of small boats to form a rescue team. They were dispatched to various streets to find and rescue disaster victims, transporting them to Nangang to live in the open. Because they were busy with the rescue, they were not allowed to carry miscellaneous belongings, so the disaster victims had to reluctantly abandon all their possessions and leave with only what they were wearing. The rescue was not completed until the fifteenth and sixteenth. There were still tens of thousands of people who were unwilling to abandon their belongings and remained steadfast in the water, making their own rafts to struggle against the floodwaters. At the same time, some people were also building rafts and boats, rushing into the water to retrieve miscellaneous items to survive. The floodwaters gradually encroached upon the border between Daoli and Daowai. Roads such as Xǔ Gōnglù, Jǐngyáng Street, and Zhōngmǎ Road were all submerged in a vast expanse of water, with depths of about three to four feet. It was not until after the eighteenth that the water level began to stabilize. In Daowai, only Táohuā Alley, Kùdāng Street, Rényì Alley, and Dà Shuǐjīng Street remained unflooded. After the twentieth, the entire city of Harbin, except for the residential areas near Nangang, Mǎjiāgōu, Xiangfang, Gùxiāngtūn, and Tiánjiā Distillery, was submerged. The commercial districts of Daoli, Daowai, the Eight Stations, and Xin’an Port were completely flooded. Since the twenty-first, the river water has not risen or fallen significantly. The water level on the twenty-third, measured at the main current, was 134.08 meters deep, which is more than 50 meters higher than usual. As for downstream areas, the flooding was also severe. Because the Songhua River does not flow directly into the sea, the discharge is very slow, and it is difficult to expect the water level to drop significantly in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e94">▲ Food Panic <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the city was flooded, the prices of daily necessities and staple foods such as rice and flour skyrocketed immediately. Flour increased by five or six jiao per bag (30 jin), and rice increased by one yuan per bag (45 jin). Other items also increased in price by 100% or by one-third to two-thirds. Meat and vegetables were also unavailable, and initially there was nowhere to buy them. It was not until after the sixteenth and seventeenth that the puppet government, with permission from the Japanese side, allowed vendors to set up temporary straw sheds in unflooded areas of Nangang, Daoli, and Daowai to sell goods. As a result, straw sheds lined the streets in the unflooded areas, and stalls were densely packed. The puppet government also issued orders to crack down on price gouging, with the investigation department supervising investigations daily and punishing three or four merchants who raised prices excessively. As a result, prices dropped slightly, but were still more than double what they were before the flood. The stocks of rice and flour in the city were depleted due to a lack of sources or because they were flooded, so flour mills had not resumed production. Xiechangyong, the largest grain store, had approximately 300 shi of grain in storage, but because it was located by the river in Daowai, it was completely flooded, with losses estimated at three to four million. The stocks of grain in other grain stores were also not moved out in time. According to an investigation by the Flood Prevention Department, the total amount of food stored in Harbin was not enough for the city to consume for 20 days. Grain-producing areas along the river were all affected by flooding, and the wheat harvest was hopeless. In a month, the people will feel an extreme panic about food. Therefore, discerning people, after the Harbin-Changchun transportation was restored a few days ago, all moved south to avoid the disaster. The area affected by this flood is so large that there is no one responsible for providing relief afterward. The crisis is lurking, and the future is worrying.</p>

<p>In Daowai, which was already flooded, a major fire broke out on August 9th. The fire started at Tianyitang Pharmacy on the east side of 11th Street. The water depth there was more than ten feet. The fire burned from inside the two-story building, starting at 6:00 AM and not being extinguished until 11:00 PM. More than 230 buildings in the vicinity were destroyed. Although the fire brigade witnessed the fire, the water was too deep for the fire trucks to drive to, so they allowed it to burn out on its own. However, when the fire was spreading, a suspect named Jia Kuiyi was arrested and taken to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. He confessed that he had a personal grudge against the landlord and took the opportunity to set the fire to vent his anger. He was placed in custody awaiting transfer to the court, but the suspect actually took advantage of the police's inattention and drowned himself in the water at night. On August 17th, another person named Yang Changshan also set fire to the Sun family's building on North 7th Street in Daowai to vent his anger. He was arrested by the police and beheaded in public on the 20th. Puppet police and Japanese military police have been patrolling in boats in shifts for days, and security has been tightened compared to before. Various agencies in Daowai have been moved to Nangang or to ships due to the flooding. Important military, police, and administrative agencies are continuing to operate as usual, while judicial offices and less important agencies have temporarily suspended work.</p>
<h3 id="e96">▲ Plague Rampant <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>In addition to those who have relatives and friends to turn to, nearly 70,000 disaster victims are living in the open in Nangang, divided into three areas east of Xu Highway. One area is along the upper embankment of Nangang, one is along Jile Temple Street, and one is along Shan Street to the Confucius Temple. In addition, the Puppet Government’s Extraordinary Flood Disaster Relief Committee borrowed land from various schools and public places to accommodate disaster victims, setting up a total of 23 shelters. Each shelter accommodates about 10,000 people at most and about 1,000 people at least. The total number of people living in shelters is approximately 80,000. Those living in the open in Nangang were initially exposed to the wind and rain. Before the 17th, there were several heavy rainfalls, and the disaster victims, especially women and children, cried out miserably, which was heartbreaking to witness. In the past week, the Extraordinary Flood Disaster Relief Committee has allocated funds to the Red Swastika Society to build straw sheds, one shed per household or one shed for every few households. Although this has fortunately prevented them from being exposed to the elements, they are still unable to shield themselves from heavy rain. Now that the weather is turning cold, disaster victims are contracting cholera due to being exposed to dampness, and hundreds of people are dying every day. The Japanese side, fearing that the plague would spread to their troops, specifically demanded 100,000 yuan from the puppet government to specifically handle disease prevention. Disease prevention injections are administered daily. However, the disease prevention team performs operations regardless of the strength of the Chinese people's bodies, forcing them to get vaccinations, causing many people who were not sick to become sick. The general disaster victims, fearing injections, run away by the thousands every day. As for food, the Red Swastika Society distributes 12 taels of large pancakes or four steamed buns per person per day. Because most of these are moldy and rotten, many disaster victims get sick after eating them. Disaster victims who had original jobs are trying to maintain their livelihoods by retrieving their belongings from the water and setting up shops in the straw sheds, making the Nangang disaster victim area colorful and diverse, with all kinds of businesses. Regarding the relief efforts for disaster victims, the puppet government plans to drive them back to their original homes inside the customs. Those who are willing to go will be transported free of charge by the South Manchuria Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway. Those whose original homes are in the Northeast will be transported to Shuangcheng and Acheng counties for resettlement. However, many disaster victims are unwilling to leave immediately because their accumulated property is still in the water. They would rather endure their miserable lives and wait for the water to recede before cleaning things up. However, those who do not have much savings have agreed to leave Harbin, and their numbers are also very large. Recently, the Chinese Eastern Railway built a row of plank houses on high ground between the Xinzhengyang River and Xin'an Port, which can accommodate more than 10,000 disaster victims, and allocated dozens of train carriages to be parked near the 36th Shed to accommodate disaster victims. Foreign merchants from the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries who reside in Harbin have also formed an International Relief Association and set up a shelter at the French University, which accommodates thousands of disaster victims.</p>
<h3 id="e97">▲ Flood Drainage Plans <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The water level has not dropped significantly, and the city's originally low-lying areas are unlikely to drain into the river on their own. Therefore, the Puppet Government’s Extraordinary Flood Disaster Relief Committee plans to use drainage methods. However, pumping machines are difficult to find immediately, so they have specifically ordered ten units from foreign trading companies, each unit costing more than 20,000 yuan. Daoli and Daowai are divided into two zones, with Daoli and Xin'an Port as one zone, to carry out the first phase of drainage. Daowai is one zone and will be the second phase of drainage. The first phase is scheduled to install pumping machines on September 2nd and is expected to be completed by September 20th, but this depends on whether it does not rain in the coming days and the river water does not rise again. Daowai has too much accumulated water and is difficult to construct, so it must wait for the water level to drop slightly before draining it. It is expected to start in early October and take one and a half months to drain, completing the drainage by mid-November. Businessmen in Daowai are very dissatisfied with this plan because they feel that it prioritizes one area over the other. Moreover, Daowai is the commercial center, the water is deeper, there are more disaster victims, and the accumulated water has already begun to stink. Houses have been flooded and countless have collapsed. Flood prevention is disease prevention. Logically and morally, Daowai should be prioritized over Daoli. They have presented their reasons and strongly argued with the Extraordinary Flood Disaster Relief Committee, but the committee is controlled by the Japanese, so they insist on their plan. The Japanese side believes that Daoli is a foreign residential area and fears criticism from foreigners, so they prioritize Daoli, neglecting Daowai, where hundreds of thousands of Chinese people rely on for survival. However, various groups in Daowai still believe that if the Flood Disaster Relief Committee's plan is implemented, the accumulated water in Daowai will become increasingly smelly, and the spread of germs will be even faster. They fear that there will be no hope of draining the water before it freezes, and the property losses of the 200,000 residents of Daowai will not be less than 40 to 50 million. Therefore, they are spontaneously uniting and plan to imitate the Daoli plan, contracting drainage machinery to carry out pumping. According to general observations, Daowai's prosperity, regardless of the current situation of national subjugation, oppression, and economic decline, cannot be expected to recover in the short term. Even if there is a slight hope that the Northeast can be restored, it will not be possible for at least six or seven years. As for the accumulated water in the city, it currently has a pungent odor, making work extremely difficult. If it is delayed for one or two months, the turbidity of the water will be unimaginable. In recent days, anyone going to Daowai has been wearing sanitary masks, but they are still unable to block the pungent odor.</p>
<h3 id="e98">▲ Northern Border Crisis <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Among the cities and towns along the river that have been most severely affected by flooding, in addition to Yilan, Tangwang River, Lianjiangkou, Xinchengzhen, Suibin County, Fujin County, and Jiamusi are also heavily impacted. Tangwang River and Lianjiangkou were completely submerged, and countless residents died. Fujin, Xinchengzhen, and Suibin County are all the richest grain-producing areas. After being flooded, the stored grain stones were all submerged. In the past, the staple foods and exported soybeans and wheat in the Northeast all came from these counties. Now, due to the flood, the people of the Northeast have no source of food. In addition to the cities and towns downstream that were flooded, the Chinese Eastern Railway line and the upper reaches of the Songhua River and the Nen River basin were also affected by flooding. The three lines of transportation of the Chinese Eastern Railway have long lost their flexibility. The Miaotaizi, Fularji, and Boketu areas on the Harbin-Manzhouli line were also heavily flooded, and traffic has been interrupted since late July. The Chinese Eastern Railway has allocated more than 250 material cars and summoned more than 5,000 workers to repair the roadbed, but it was still washed away by the water. After strenuous repairs, passenger and freight trains between Harbin and Ang'angxi were finally opened last week. The section from Ang'angxi to Manzhouli is still closed. Due to the heavy flooding of the Ashi River, the Harbin-Suihua line only allows passenger and freight trains to reach Ashihe Station. The area east of Ashihe is still closed. Caigou Station on the Harbin-Changchun line was flooded in late July, with the tracks flooded for 285 kilometers and the roadbed washed away. Traffic was cut off. Vehicles from Harbin only go to Shuangchengbu, and vehicles from Changchun go to Caigou Station. In the middle where there is water, small boats are used for communication. It was not until August 20th that a pontoon bridge was built, and passengers traveling back and forth had to get off the bus north and south of the bridge and walk 370 meters. The railway bureau measured that the tracks would be repaired on the 25th to achieve full line operation, but to this day (25th) there is still no confirmation of the opening of the line. The Japanese side said that the Soviet Union intends to block traffic, is not actively involved in restoring it, and intends to create chaos in northern Manchuria to facilitate the opportunity for communism. Although the statement is excessive, the Soviet Union definitely has this intention. At present, many barracks have been built outside Manzhouli, and international communist propaganda teams have been sent to the Dongning area to carry out propaganda. This is also worthy of attention. (August 25th)</p>

<p>Relieving the People's Hardships and Preparing for Relief</p>
<p>Rectifying Military Discipline and Prohibiting Opium Smoking</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou states that Chiang Kai-shek, Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Suppression in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, has recently paid close attention to the relief of the people's hardships, the preparation of relief, the rectification of military discipline, and the prohibition of bad habits in the wake of the victory over the Communists. On August 31, he specifically issued measures to reduce and exempt land taxes in the counties affected by the Communists, urged evacuees to return to their homes, officially appointed county magistrates as military judges, and stipulated measures to prohibit opium smoking by party, government, military, and educational institutions. These are the most important measures in the victory over the Communists, and their details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e100">▲ Reducing and Exempting Land Taxes in the Counties Affected by the Communists <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang stated that the counties in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui that have been affected by the Communists have now been gradually recovered. To implement disaster relief and care for the people, in addition to already instructing subordinates to find ways to provide relief, he has also formulated temporary measures for reducing and exempting land taxes in the areas affected by the Communists. On August 31, he instructed the three provincial governments to follow the measures. The order stated: "In order to carry out the order, it is hereby stated that the red bandits are cruelly destructive by nature and indiscriminately burn and kill. In all areas that they have ravaged, most people have died, their homes have been reduced to ruins, and strong men have been displaced, and the fields are barren. As a result, even in years when the five grains are abundant, the people still have to worry about famine. Since I, the Commander-in-Chief, came to Hubei to supervise the suppression of the Communists, all areas affected by the Communists in the provinces have been gradually recovered. However, according to the reports from the military commanders, the various cruel and desolate situations are rarely seen in ancient history. In accordance with the principles of disaster relief and care for the people, we should urgently formulate a plan for recuperation and rehabilitation. Therefore, we have specifically formulated temporary measures for reducing and exempting land taxes in the areas affected by the Communists in the provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, and promulgated them for implementation to alleviate the people's hardships. After the order is implemented, all military and political leaders in the recovered Communist areas must strictly comply with it and strictly prohibit any attempt to levy taxes on any pretext or to deliberately impose harsh taxes. In addition to separate orders, we are issuing a copy of the temporary measures for reducing and exempting land taxes and ordering you to comply with them and instruct all counties in the Communist areas under your jurisdiction to comply with them as well. This is important."</p>
<h3 id="e101">▲ Urging Evacuees to Return to Their Homes <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>On August 1, Commander-in-Chief Chiang instructed the Hubei Provincial Government, the Pacification Committee for Communist Suppression of the Garrison Headquarters, and the Hubei Rural Reconstruction Promotion Association to encourage evacuees from all counties to return to their homes and assist in relief efforts. Those who do not return by September will have all of their original homes and properties distributed to disaster victims. The original order is as follows: "In order to issue an order, I, the Commander-in-Chief, lament the rampant spread of the red scourge and the suffering of the people. Since I came to Hubei to supervise the suppression of the Communists, thanks to the efforts of the officers and soldiers of the armies, the areas affected by the Communists in central and eastern Hubei have been gradually recovered. However, it has been repeatedly reported by the armies suppressing the Communists on the front lines that all the recovered counties have suffered because the local gentry have mostly evacuated and have not returned, so no one has come forward to take responsibility for all the relief efforts that need to be carried out locally. This has a great impact on the future of eliminating the remaining bandits and restoring local prosperity. The only way to remedy this situation is to quickly urge the gentry from all counties who have evacuated to return to their hometowns by a set date and jointly prepare for relief. I have recently made active and detailed plans for all the recovered counties, including local security, the recruitment of displaced persons, and the relief of the people's livelihood, and have sent cadres to the counties to conduct on-site inspections in order to implement them as quickly and effectively as possible. We rely on the concerted efforts of the people and gentry of the area, and the military and political leaders at all levels to cooperate sincerely and openly, so that all the important relief policies can be promoted to their fullest extent and the prosperity of peaceful and contented life can be restored as soon as possible. Otherwise, after the cruel burning, killing, and looting by the red bandits in the recovered areas, they will become a desolate and smokeless zone. Even if sages and philosophers are reborn, they will not be able to do anything on their own. In the past, when the Taiping Rebellion rose, its power was so great that it spread throughout the Yangtze River basin, which is far more powerful than the current red bandits. However, Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, Peng Yulin, and Li Hongzhang, whether they were gentry in their hometowns during periods of mourning or scholars who were well-versed in the classics, once they aroused their loyalty and righteousness, they relied on the efforts of three or two people to revitalize and advocate, and to maintain the declining fate of the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, it is known that the days of national crisis and danger are precisely when people of high ideals and benevolence should wear their official hats and let down their hair. Moreover, now that foreign enemies are encroaching and the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, if domestic pacification can be achieved quickly, we can naturally strengthen our prestige to resist foreign aggression. Gu Yanwu said that every man has a responsibility for the rise and fall of the world, and this is the time. For this reason, we order you to quickly investigate the gentry in the counties in the recovered Communist areas who have evacuated, to advise and urge them to return to their hometowns by the end of September, to make efforts for their local lives and families with a warm heart for saving their hometowns and saving the country. If they fail to return after the deadline, it means that they are willing to abandon the land of their ancestral tombs and only seek personal pleasure and comfort. All of their original homes and properties will no longer be taken care of by themselves, and they will be used to distribute to the local disaster victims to meet the needs of emergency relief. In addition to separate orders, we order you to comply with this order, advise the gentry in the recovered counties to return to their hometowns by a set date to prepare for relief matters, participate in the close organization of the people, strengthen the local self-defense forces, and be careful not to hesitate and delay, lest you regret losing your homes. We also order you to thoroughly investigate the names and addresses of the gentry in all counties in Hubei affected by the Communists (whether or not they have been recovered) who have evacuated to Wuhan and report them to the headquarters. This order is important." At the same time, it also ordered the Pacification Committee to supervise the gentry from Xianning traveling to the province to return to their counties by a set date (To be continued)</p>

<p>There are more than 100 prisoners in this county prison, many of whom are opium addicts. On the afternoon of the 28th, a disturbance suddenly broke out among the prisoners, who shouted in unison for food, reaching the outside of the prison. Warden Su immediately reported it to the county magistrate and requested the Public Security Bureau to send police to suppress the riot. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Shen, together with the president of the court and the prosecutor, entered the prison and gave the prisoners cordial advice, and the turmoil gradually subsided before they were locked up again. There are various theories about the cause of the disturbance among the prisoners. Some say that the amount of food distributed to the prisoners did not match the prescribed weight, which seems credible. The next day, the warden investigated the ringleaders and mistakenly identified a prisoner named Yang, an opium addict who was about to complete his sentence, as the instigator and brought him out for punishment. He was severely beaten on the buttocks with rattan whips, with bloodstains and numerous scars, which was unbearable to witness.</p>

<p>The provincial government believes that elementary education is very important, and in order to select teachers, it previously held examinations and certifications. Now, this county's education bureau has received an order from the provincial government to hold elementary school teacher registration, issue regulations, and send letters to the education committees of each district, who will forward them to the teachers of each school to fill out forms and submit them. The location of the future examinations in this county is designated at Shanghai Provincial High School. There are six requirements for this year's registration. All teachers from normal schools and secondary schools under the old system must submit verification certificates, photos, and other documents.</p>

<p>The rumor of public opium sales has gradually become a reality. Yesterday, Feng Hechá, a commissioner from the Hubei Special Tax Office stationed in Jiangsu Province, came to Suzhou from Zhenjiang to meet with County Magistrate Zou at the county government to discuss everything and request assistance. According to Mr. Weng, a member of Feng's entourage, he has been ordered to come to Suzhou to discuss the public sale of special tax goods. The stamps for these special tax goods are all affixed in Hankou and transported to Suzhou. After arriving in Zhenjiang, they are transferred to various counties. The locations for the public sale of special tax goods in each county have already been determined by the province, with each county having four or five to more than ten locations. The procedure requires special tax merchants in each county to register with the province first, and only after obtaining approval can they receive special tax goods for sale; otherwise, they will be treated as selling privately. The Jiangsu office is located in Zhenjiang, and there is also a general office located in Hubei. No branch offices are established in each county, nor is any kind of name or signboard used. The public sale period for these special tax goods is limited to three months, and it will be stopped as soon as the province's finances are slightly eased. Yesterday, more than a dozen people in Suzhou who wanted to buy and sell these special tax goods contacted Commissioner Feng to discuss the procedures. Once everything is settled, it can be realized.</p>

<p>Zhu Tieying, the editor of the Taicang Moxie Daily, was arrested for writing about business tax matters, stating the difficulties of businessmen and appealing to the director of the business tax bureau. Unexpectedly, he angered the county government. On the afternoon of August 29, at 3:00 PM, Zhou Wenqing, a special agent from the county government, led police officers to summon Zhu Tieying to the county government for questioning. Zhu immediately followed them to the county government, where County Magistrate Zhao personally interrogated him and accused him of inciting businessmen and resisting the payment of national taxes, fining him 100 yuan and sentencing him to one year in prison. The next morning, the newspaper was banned from publication and the newspaper office was closed. As a result, Zhu Tieying was imprisoned and tasted the flavor of iron bars. Currently, all sectors of Taicang are greatly angered because the counties affected by the war have been exempted from all taxes after discussions by the provincial government. Now, County Magistrate Zhao has accused Zhu of attempting to overthrow the national government and harming the interests of the Republic of China for appealing to the people, and everyone is greatly angered and has risen up to support him. It has also been heard that Lu Jingshi, Zhu Shuren, Hu Yanggang, Dai Yongchan, and others from the same township living in Shanghai are particularly agitated and are determined to rescue Zhu from prison. Because he has been unjustly imprisoned, Zhu has been on a hunger strike since the day before yesterday to urge the authorities to wake up.</p>

<p>The Wuyi New Merchant Steamboat Changsha班 set sail from Changzhou on the 29th at about 9:00 PM. Four or five people who looked like workers were found on the boat. When it reached the pier of the Benniu Branch Bureau, a group of bandits suddenly appeared on the shore and opened fire on the boat with firecrackers, ordering it to stop. At this time, the "workers" inside the boat also came out and forced the captain to approach the shore. Before long, the bandits swarmed onto the boat and looted at will. The captain and passengers lost a great deal of silver dollars, valuables, and jewelry. In addition, there have been a series of robberies in Wuyi in recent days. For example, the home of Zhou Ronggeng in Hongta Village in the First District and the home of Liu Jirong in Guotang Bridge in the Fourth District have been robbed one after another. In the vicinity of Benniu, there have also been seven or eight robberies of航轮班 boats in recent days, so passengers are all very afraid of traveling there.</p>

<p>▲ Arrest of Thieves Cutting and Stealing Electric Wires The Qishuyan Power Plant's office in Wuxi, for the sake of electrical convenience with the Qishuyan Power Plant, had hung two pairs of No. 12 wires on existing utility poles. This allowed communication between Wuxi and Qishuyan, commonly known as "intercom lines." Unexpectedly, in July, a section of this intercom line behind Xiyuan in Huishan was suddenly cut and stolen, rendering it unusable. After re-hanging the wires, the lines were restored to their original state. However, in August, a section of the same line was cut and stolen three times in succession. The Wuxi Electrical Affairs Department instructed Wu Jinrong, a line patrol worker, to investigate covertly. Simultaneously, three telephone wires at Wangxueyan Bridge in Wuxi were also cut and stolen south of Wuqiao. At that time, Wu Zhihui, an important figure in the Party, was unable to call the city due to the incident. He immediately instructed Yao Dixing, the head of the county's Construction Bureau, to investigate and reconnect the lines. Director Yao, upon receiving the order, instructed Li Jingqing, another line patrol worker, to investigate and report. On August 19th, Wu Jinrong and Li Jingqing, working together at Xin Sanli Bridge in Beitang, apprehended a thief named Li Jugen, along with a coil of No. 12 copper wire. They were handed over to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau and then transferred to the County Public Security Bureau. They were then sent to the County Court, where Prosecutor Shen held a hearing and immediately ordered their detention. Yesterday, the workers Wu Jinrong, Li Jingqing, and police officer Shi Jie were summoned to court to testify. After their testimony, they were immediately indicted and transferred to the trial court. However, the power plant and the Construction Bureau believed that Li Jugen's cutting and stealing of the electric wires was not an isolated incident and could not be treated as a simple theft case. They insisted that he be punished under the crime of endangering public transportation. Therefore, they have separately sent letters to the County Court, requesting that he be severely punished.</p>

They killed one bandit, Ding San, on the spot and captured the bandit leader, Hu Ba, and a suspected accomplice, Zhang Xiaocaizi. Captain Zhu immediately escorted Hu and Zhang to the city and transferred them to the county government for legal proceedings. After interrogation, Zhang Xiaocaizi was released on bail, while Hu Ba was shackled and imprisoned.

<p>▲ Resolution of the Qixiu School Land Occupation Case Since the abolition of warehouses in Xicangji, north of Jiaxing, You Xiuliang had negotiated with the authorities to rebuild the Qixiu Girls' School (a private school founded by the You family). However, the area was vast, totaling over 29 mu, and had been occupied by the You family for over a decade. This time, due to the demolition in the northern city, a local citizen, Wang Liangchen, reported the matter to the authorities. However, the You family, oblivious to the situation, claimed that the warehouse land was ancestral property and requested a court trial. Ultimately, due to a lack of evidence, the case remained unresolved after more than two years of litigation. Subsequently, the educational authorities discovered that You had issued a land borrowing agreement when the school was rebuilt. They then reported to the province for instructions. The province recognized the land as public property and ordered the county to assess its value and collect taxes. The six mu already registered under Qixiu's name should also be thoroughly investigated to determine if the land tax payment was legal at the time. It is now known that the county government, upon receiving the order, has assessed the 23.25 mu of land occupied by You at a price of 500 yuan per mu, referencing the neighboring commercial school's old site. You is required to pay 11,625 yuan. The land occupation case, unresolved for several years, can now be considered concluded.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 1st - The Ministry of Education, noting that a significant number of high schools and above in various provinces and cities have not yet implemented military education and that military instructors should be dispatched to carry out training, has ordered all specialized schools and above that have not yet implemented military education to submit accurate reports of their student numbers, class numbers, and grade numbers within one month of receiving this document to facilitate overall assessment and allocation.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st - The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments of various provinces and cities, stating that the purpose of school academic affairs meetings is to improve the overall academic affairs of the school.

<h3 id="e122">Ministry of Education Orders Universalization of Rural Public Education in Various Counties <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st - The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments of various provinces and cities, stating that, according to the report submitted by the China Social Education Society, past social education efforts have tended to focus on cities and neglect rural areas. Future improvements should focus on rural public education. To this end, Gao Yang, a member of the society, has drafted a plan for the universalization of rural public education in various counties of Jiangsu Province, which has been adopted and implemented by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education. Jiangning, Wuxi, and Nanhui counties have been tentatively designated as pilot areas, and other provinces may follow suit. Therefore, the original draft plan is being forwarded and presented, requesting that various provinces and cities designate several counties for pilot implementation. Considering that our country is currently facing unprecedented national difficulties, and to truly awaken the national consciousness and self-rescue spirit of the people, it is imperative to vigorously promote the universalization of rural public education. The various sections of the original draft plan are essential and can serve as a reference for various provinces and cities to promote public education. A booklet of the plan is being printed and issued for reference in pilot implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Ministry of Education Clarifies That Vocational Schools Can Establish Film Departments <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on a report submitted by the China Vocational Education Society, notes that the Shanghai Women's High School stated in a letter that film is a powerful tool for modern education, and that all European, American, and Japanese countries actively promote it, with universities establishing specialized departments and normal schools often including it as a required course. Elementary schools often use film as an aid to teaching. In addition, institutions such as the National Educational Film Review Office of Germany, the National Educational Film Review Office and Film Education Academy of Italy, and the Film Education Research Association of the Japanese Ministry of Education, and the National Children's Film Museum of Soviet Russia all serve as important evidence of the importance of film education. Although there have been enthusiastic advocates in our country in recent years, there is a lack of corresponding facilities. The school, recognizing this, plans to add a film education department in the next semester to cultivate specialized talents. However, due to the pioneering nature of this endeavor, there is a lack of clear standards in terms of the educational system. Furthermore, it involves vocational education, and a special letter is being sent to your society for interpretation or to request instructions from the Ministry. After reviewing the film project, it is indeed a powerful tool for modern education and should be guided and specialized talent cultivated to meet the needs. However, the level of education required and the type of school to which it is equivalent have not been specified in our country's educational system. Therefore the Ministry is requesting instructions. The Ministry of Education clarified that while film can indeed be a powerful tool for modern education, it currently has no standing in the existing educational system. With the exception of vocational schools, girls' high schools and other formal schools may not establish film departments or specialized classes. This is for your information and dissemination.</p>

<p>Teng Gu, a former professor of art history at the Shanghai Art College, went to Europe in 1929 to study art history. He was recently approved by the Prussian Ministry of Education to take his degree examination. After being interviewed in turn by the heads of philosophy, art history, archeology, history, and other departments, he passed each one and was formally awarded a doctorate. The overall comment was the Latin word "Egregie." The degree examination in art history and archeology at the University of Berlin is very rigorous. Scholars from other countries spend five or six years at the very least, or more than ten years, still waiting to be selected. Dr. Teng, however, obtained the degree with two or three years of effort. Moreover, Dr. Teng is the first Chinese person to obtain this degree, which is a supreme honor internationally. It is reported that Dr. Teng is scheduled to return to China from Germany this month and will continue to teach at the Shanghai Art College.</p>

It is currently being prepared and will be moved into soon. It is reported that the school was originally founded to help poor out-of-school youth, so tuition is waived for students with excellent grades, and boarding students only pay a boarding fee of five yuan.

<p>43 to 37</p>
<p>Tennis Team to Play Youyou This Afternoon</p>
<p>The basketball team of the Sichuan 20th Army Expeditionary Force demonstrated its strength for the second time last night, defeating the Youyou Sports Association 43 to 37 at the Youyou Basketball Court. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The 20th Army Leads from Beginning to End - A Smooth Victory The 20th Army led from the beginning to the end. In the first quarter, they defeated the enemy 16 to 9. The result of the first half was 31 to 18. After the change of sides in the second half, Youyou bravely counterattacked and once created a tense situation, gradually closing the gap. At the end of the third quarter, the score was 34 to 31, only a difference of three points. However, the 20th Army scored several times with excellent coordination, and the final score was 43 to 37.</p>
<p>Impressive Skills - The basketball skills of the Sichuan Army are probably the best among all ball games. The coordination is excellent. Several successful shots were the result of their skilled and rapid passing. It is a pity that they lack control in shooting and missed many opportunities. It is also not the best strategy to shoot from a distance and not dribble under the basket. The courage to fight is a characteristic of soldiers, but sometimes both sides are too aggressive, which is a minor flaw. The referee was Shao Leping. The scores of the two teams are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e146">City Government Issues Announcement Yesterday <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Both Chinese and Foreign Authorities Have Spoken to Dispel Rumors</p>
<p>The City's Morale Was Slightly Calmer Yesterday</p>
<p>Due to rampant rumors in the city in recent days, the residents were quite apprehensive. After the Chinese and Japanese authorities issued separate statements clarifying that there would be no second war, people's morale began to stabilize slightly. Therefore, the number of residents moving out of the Hongkou and Zhabei areas decreased yesterday. Both Chinese and foreign authorities made statements yesterday to stabilize public sentiment. The compilation of these statements is as follows:</p>
<p>▲City Government Announcement: The Shanghai Municipal Government issued an announcement yesterday, stating, "For the purpose of public announcement, since the January 28th Incident, the people of this city, motivated by patriotic fervor, have eagerly sought to save the nation and society. Their righteous indignation has often manifested in radical actions. However, patriotic movements should strictly adhere to the boundaries of the law to avoid disrupting social stability and providing excuses for others. Otherwise, patriotism can easily mislead the nation, and saving the people can easily harm them. Recently, there have been frequent cases of threatening letters, even throwing bombs and injuring people in the Special District under the name of 'Blood Oath to Eliminate Traitors' or other names, disrupting public security and undermining order. This is extremely serious. The Mayor, in order to maintain local security, has repeatedly ordered crackdowns. If anyone still disregards the safety of the nation and society, they will be punished according to the law. It is hoped that all citizens will understand this and strictly abide by it without fail. This announcement is critical."</p>
<p>▲Yu Hongjun's Statement: Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun said to visitors yesterday, "Recently, rumors have been rampant. The general public does not carefully distinguish them and are easily alarmed, especially in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and western Shanghai areas. It is not surprising that citizens are afraid after the war. However, believing unfounded rumors and moving away en masse is not only unnecessarily alarming but also causes both mental and financial losses that are difficult to calculate. The City Government, to stabilize public sentiment and maintain public security, has issued an announcement yesterday, strictly ordering citizens to adhere to the boundaries of the law and not provide excuses for others. I firmly believe that the rumors circulating outside about a second war breaking out in Shanghai are merely speculations and not credible."</p>
<p>▲Cuninghame's Statement: Yesterday, Joint Committee Chairman Cuninghame stated to visitors, "The Joint Committee was established based on the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement of May 5th. Its mission of monitoring troop withdrawals and taking over has been completed. As for the recent rumors of Japanese troops setting up military telephones in western Shanghai and Japanese troops conducting armed demonstrations in the Hongkou area, I have not heard of them. Furthermore, the Sino-Japanese Armistice Agreement is still fresh, and there should be no further incidents. If, unfortunately, the situation in Shanghai becomes serious again, the Joint Committee can convene a meeting of the Joint Committee according to regulations upon the request of either China or Japan. As for whether the authorities of the Public Concession will allow the Japanese side to conduct military operations within the Concession again, I cannot answer on their behalf." Cuninghame also said that although the situation in Shanghai appears serious, much of it is rumor. He hopes that the Chinese and foreign press will be extra cautious in their reports to avoid further disputes.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Mayor Wu's Letter to the Citizens of Shanghai <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Peace and Order are the Conditions for Shanghai's Revival and Development</p>
<p>Hope Citizens Recognize the Path to National Salvation and Avoid Frivolity and Impatience</p>
<p>I Pledge to Strive for Peace and Revival with Utmost Determination</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng published a letter to the citizens yesterday, stating, "Shanghai is the economic center of our country and the hub of international trade. Its prosperity, governance, and chaos are not only related to the rise and fall of our national fortune but also to the interests of foreign nationals. Since the January 28th Incident, the overall situation has been devastated, vitality has been greatly lost, citizens have been displaced, and commerce has been depressed. Now that the war has ended, there are many scars waiting to be healed. All of my fellow citizens should be enduring hardship, working together to build up and revive, and pooling our wisdom and efforts to seek revival. When I, the Mayor, was appointed by the Party and the State, it was at a time when the Shanghai Incident was at its most tense. I did my best to overcome difficulties. Fortunately, with the loyal courage of the soldiers on the front lines defending themselves and the enthusiastic support of the people everywhere, we were able to restore peace to Shanghai. For the past six months, I have been thinking day and night, deeply feeling that after the serious damage to this city and the displacement of the citizens, it is imperative to recuperate and rejuvenate in order to seek revival. The only and most important condition is a foundation of peace and a state of order. Only peace and order can restore the vitality of this city, promote the development of this city, relieve the suffering of the citizens, and quietly seek a plan for the overall construction of this city in the future and remove all obstacles to revival and development. After extensive visits and consultations, and after quiet observation, I deeply feel that the citizens of Shanghai and the people of the whole country have suffered deeply and have reached the limit. I cannot bear to see them being subjected to unnecessary disturbances, further unnecessary disputes, and further unexpected devastation. I pledge to ensure the peace and order of Shanghai in the future with the greatest confidence, the greatest determination, and the greatest courage. All of my fellow citizens should also recognize the conditions for the revival and development of this city in the future, move your hearts, endure your nature, do not be angry at the spur of the moment, do not engage in superficial tensions, and do not engage in frivolous and reckless actions. You must know that the life of the nation is in grave danger, and a dying tree cannot withstand further felling. Last year, the Central Government announced to the people of the whole country that 'saving the nation and resisting aggression is the most difficult and serious task in the world.' What we should dedicate ourselves to our motherland is not a momentary impulse, not a momentary indignation, but a determination to fight permanently and strive to save the nation. The biggest weakness of mass movements in recent years is that they mistakenly believe superficiality to be reality and means to be ends. Therefore, they often abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial, recklessly use their efforts, and fail to accomplish anything and even ruin things. This is truly an undeniable weakness in the psychology of our people and the crux of the failure of national movements over the years. This is the sharp edge of why China's national morale is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and why China's diplomacy has failed repeatedly. I, the Mayor, am determined to save the nation and am responsible for protecting the people. All of my fellow citizens should also consider the overall situation, love the nation, do not be frivolous, do not be impatient, do not overstep the bounds, and do not violate the law. Let patriotism be based on sincerity, and actions must be legal. Since the national crisis, labor unrest has been rampant, and the suffering from mutual attacks is even worse than before. Social instability and production stagnation have followed the war. How can the nation's lifeline and the people's lives bear it? At the same time, lawless elements are also borrowing names, overstepping the boundaries of their actions, inciting people's hearts and disturbing public security. If this continues, what hope is there? To secure the interior and resist foreign aggression, to save the nation and seek strength, is the duty of the Mayor. For such lawless elements who overstep the bounds, I will definitely deal with them strictly according to the law in order to maintain law and order and strengthen the foundation of the country. I deeply hope that patriotic compatriots and foreign residents in Shanghai will understand this and maintain the peace and order of this city, and strengthen the revival and development of Shanghai. I, the Mayor, have high hopes for this."</p>

<h3 id="e149">Ministry of Railways Explains Responsibility for Transportation <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Association Proposed Seven Points</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways Replied with Detailed Explanations of Each Item</p>
<p>Adding a 10% Fee is a Precedent Set by the Former Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>All Nineteen Items in the General Rules are Based on Civil Law</p>
<p>The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain and Oil Cake Trade Association recently sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways, pointing out various shortcomings in the regulations for responsible transportation and requested instructions from the Ministry. It is now heard that the Ministry of Railways has replied to the Association with detailed explanations of each item. The general content is as follows: (1) Responsible transportation has long been practiced in various countries. Railroad transportation in our country has not been responsible, resulting in countless malpractices, which is undeniable. Merchants and people suffer from multiple layers of exploitation when transporting goods, which is extremely difficult (the average freight paid is 40% to 100% more than the railroad freight). The Ministry resolutely reformed this system to relieve the suffering of merchants and people. All equipment and procedures are adapted to responsible transportation. In order to unify the handling of affairs, it is inconvenient to implement responsible and non-responsible transportation at the same time, as this would result in the same malpractices and divergent handling of affairs. Moreover, railroad transportation should be responsible in principle. All railroads across the country will change from non-responsible to responsible, so there is no reason to keep both systems coexisting; (2) The reason for adding a 10% surcharge for responsible transportation is that there are records of general rules promulgated by the Ministry of Communications before the tenth year of the Republic, and this is not an exceptional addition. In the past, freight rates were calculated based on the transportation costs at that time. Now that responsible transportation is implemented, costs have increased significantly, such as adding freight yards, warehouses, tarpaulins, employees, road police, and compensation for losses. The meager 10% surcharge may not be enough to offset these costs. The multiple layers of exploitation suffered by merchants in non-responsible transportation are definitely more than this 10%. The actual freight expenditure is reduced rather than increased. As mentioned earlier, it is more than 40% to 100%. If only 10% is added, a lot of suffering has been relieved in the transportation aspect; (3) The priority loading method is precisely to eliminate the malpractice of privately selling train cars. The method is to start shipping in the order of arrival of goods at the station. However, it is bound to be inconvenient for goods with price or contractual special relationships, so we must find a way out for them. This regulation is purely for the benefit of the merchants; (4) Regarding the regulations for various expenses, the thirteen types listed in the letter are not all uniformly collected in reality. However, a very small number of fees are charged only when special equipment or procedures are necessary. According to past practice, the same fees must be charged when such facts occur, but this time it is less than before. For example, the ticket exchange fee used to be five yuan, but now it is called a change fee and only costs one yuan, which is clear evidence. Furthermore, not all of the listed fees must be charged item by item. Ordinary goods do not necessarily require fees other than freight, such as warming fees and refrigeration fees. Currently, there is no such equipment on various lines, so naturally, they will not be charged. Even if there is warming car and refrigerated car equipment on various lines in the future, the fees will still be limited to special fresh goods, and the purpose is still to facilitate merchants. (The original text explains and proves each item separately below, proving that fees are not charged item by item and that the fees are less than before. Because the original text is too long, it is not recorded here); (5) Goods arriving at the station at night are not calculated according to working hours, because the twelve hours from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next morning are not working hours. Therefore, the twelve-hour work unloading restriction is actually equal to eighteen hours, which can be said to be sufficient. If this is not restricted, there will be too much inventory, blocking the station, which will inevitably hinder passengers and cargo. There is obviously a misunderstanding in the letter about this; (6) The issue of liability for railroad transportation is relatively non-absolute, limited non-unlimited, both in reason and law, as it is in all countries with no exceptions. The nineteen items in Article 36 of the Responsible Transportation General Rules, which the railway cannot be responsible for, are the same as the written regulations of railroads in various countries and can be reviewed. Railroads cannot be held responsible for force majeure natural disasters, changes in the nature of the goods themselves, or the fault of the cargo owner. The nineteen items in the general rules are based on the principles stipulated in the Civil Law and serve as the basis for the law. According to the principles, not only railroads can apply, but also transfer companies can apply uniformly; (7) Under the non-responsible transportation system, merchants suffer too much from layer after layer of exploitation. Now that responsible transportation is implemented, merchants can directly report the shipment, so transfer companies cannot hoard goods. The burden on merchants is reduced, so they should come back. There is no reason to turn to water transportation instead. Moreover, now that the above items have been explained, everything should be clear. We should have a deep understanding of the Ministry of Railway's plight in alleviating the suffering of merchants and people and developing the social economy.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Newly Appointed Japanese Military Attaché to Shanghai Issues Important Statement <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper Shanghai Japanese Daily, the newly appointed military attaché candidate at the Japanese Consulate General, Colonel Yoshiwo Iwamatsu, arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru from Qingdao on the 31st of last month and immediately stayed at the Towa Yoko. Iwamatsu served as the military attaché in Shanghai from 1926 to 1928, and was later transferred to Hiroshima and Taiwan. He is now being transferred to Shanghai again. He made the following statement to Japanese reporters: "This time coming to Shanghai is originally my long-cherished wish. Since leaving school, about two-thirds of my handling of Chinese affairs has been completed. Recently, it is the period of overall resolution of Japan's China problem. All the mistakes of the past China policy must be resolutely eliminated and properly handled. In addition to discussing with local knowledgeable people, I ask for the support of everyone to make the greatest determination."</p>

<p>Effective September 1st</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation recently agreed to the request of the Shanghai Aviation News Agency to transport the aviation newspapers it handles through the agency. However, in order to promote culture and facilitate readers, it has greatly reduced freight rates. Within the Shanghai-Sichuan line, no matter which port, the fee is 90 cents per pound. Roughly, each copy of the Shen Xin Bao only costs 6 yuan and 75 cents per month for freight, and it is also limited to the fact that the selling price of all Chinese newspapers in various places of the agency shall not exceed 11 yuan per copy per month. The selling price of English newspapers should also be reduced. It is heard that the method has been implemented since September 1st.</p>

<p>The reason is that the scope is too small</p>
<p>Zhong Renjie, the municipal commissioner of Gaoqiao District, and Yang Hongjun, the municipal commissioner of Fahua District, submitted reports to the Municipal Government some days ago requesting their resignations. At last week's municipal meeting, it was resolved that the Gaoqiao and Fahua districts were too small in scope and that it was not necessary to set up municipal offices. Mayor Wu ordered the municipal offices of Gaoqiao and Fahua districts to be abolished, and the local businesses handled by each district were transferred to the Bureau of Finance, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Bureau of Land, which separately sent personnel to Gaoqiao and Fahua yesterday (September 1st) to be responsible for checking and taking over the various inventories and reporting them to the Municipal Government.</p>

We, the citizens, read in the August 25th newspaper a news item stating that your government's municipal meeting resolved to abolish the City Committee offices in Gaoqiao, the French Concession, and the Western District, which caused great consternation. This district is located in a strategic area, with a population of tens of thousands. Local administration cannot be suspended even for a day. Therefore, there was first the establishment of the township office, followed by the City Committee office. How could your government suddenly announce the abolition of the City Committee office in this district? We are truly perplexed. Furthermore, at the beginning of the City Government's establishment, the authorities, valuing local municipal affairs and accepting the public will of the district, appointed Mr. Yang Hongjun as the Municipal Affairs Commissioner for this district. Since Mr. Yang took office, he has been diligent and striving. In just a few years, the municipal affairs of this district have been completely renewed. The citizens are deeply grateful for having the right person in charge of the municipal affairs of this district. Once he departs, the future of municipal affairs in this district will be seriously affected. We, the citizens, who have grown up in this land, have a more direct understanding and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we specifically submit this document to appeal to your Excellency for review and approval, allowing the reversal of the abolition of the City Committee office in this district, and continuing to appoint Mr. Yang Hongjun as the Municipal Affairs Commissioner for this district, to comply with public opinion and value the local area. We await your urgent orders with utmost respect. Presented by the Citizens to Mayor Wu."</p>
<p>▲ The Municipal Affairs Commissioner's Office in Gaoqiao District, Pudong, had Commissioner Zhong Renjie resign due to personal matters. The City Government suddenly abolished the office. Local figures believed that during this transitional period, without a local organization to liaise, official-civilian communication would inevitably be hindered. Therefore, silk merchants and others from the district prepared a letter to the Pudong Native Place Association, unanimously seeking assistance and requesting the City Government to reverse the abolition order. The original letter stated: "Respected Sirs, the Municipal Affairs Commissioner's Office in Gaoqiao District has been abruptly abolished by order of the City Government due to the resignation of Commissioner Zhong Renjie, a personal matter. Not only will local administration lack a channel for communication, but even your association will have no one to consult regarding matters of common interest and the promotion of association affairs. Currently, the level of public knowledge is still rudimentary. Although the regulations of various bureaus and offices of the City Government are detailed and the proclamations are extremely courteous, the boundaries are distinct, and the public still finds it difficult to understand. Any requests or instructions lack a local liaison organization, leading to groping around, which will inevitably result in separation between officials and the people, and difficulties for both. Local politics will become unthinkable. We have long admired your association for prioritizing the welfare of fellow villagers and taking the promotion of hometown affairs as its primary task. We respectfully request that you promptly forward this to the Shanghai City Government, stating that the municipal organization in Gaoqiao District must not be fundamentally abolished due to the resignation of an individual. Please continue to establish it to achieve effective coordination. The members feel deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. We fear that directly presenting this petition might result in it being shelved without action. Therefore, we specifically appeal to your association for your assistance. The local area will be extremely fortunate."</p>

<p>Colleagues of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works in this city enthusiastically donated to General Ma Zhanshan's military expenses last year. They have now initiated donations for the Northeastern Volunteers. Due to difficult living conditions, they could not donate much, so they considered paying in installments. It is reported that the amount already committed is nearly 1,000 yuan. The first installment due has already reached over 270 yuan. It is also reported that the City Government and other bureaus are also working hard to collect donations.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Export Volume Report of Jiangzhe Old Factory Silk <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>According to the report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Raw Silk Inspection Department, from June to August 30th of this year, the export volume of old factory silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang was 5,786 bales. 51% was shipped to France, 30% was sold to the United States, 13% was shipped to the United Kingdom, and the remainder was sold to Africa and India.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Flour Millers Request Anhui to Waive Passport Fees for Wheat <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>In July of this year, the Anhui Rice and Grain Inspection Office was reorganized into the Rice and Grain Administration Bureau. For wheat leaving the province by train, truck, or sailboat, a passport fee of 4 jiao and 5 li per shi was charged. When Jiangsu flour millers transport wheat from Anhui, the bureau also wants to collect the same passport fee. However, the millers argue that the "Regulations on the Announcement of Special Wheat Flour Tax by the Government in the 17th Year of the Republic of China" clearly stipulates the abolition of wheat li and the collection of flour tax, and that all taxes and levies similar to li on wheat should be abolished. The Anhui Province's collection of wheat passport fees, charging per shi and setting up checkpoints, is effectively a disguised form of li. Unwilling to pay, they, through the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Inland Flour Millers Association, submitted appeals to the Ministry of Finance, the Tax Department, and the Taxation Administration, requesting a telegram to the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance, instructing the Rice and Grain Administration Bureau to cease collecting wheat passport fees and to immediately release the Datong Factory's wheat ship that had been detained. The relevant departments, well aware of the millers' suffering, have taken action accordingly. It is reported that the passport fees collected by Anhui Province are used for road construction. While the financial difficulties of the province are unavoidable, flour millers bear the burden of flour tax, and their business is already extremely difficult. Moreover, the badlands of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces are adjacent. Dasheng Pass is only a dozen kilometers away from Sanwen River in Nanjing. Once Jiangsu millers' wheat leaves Anhui Province, the cost increases by 4 jiao and 5 li per shi. The cost of flour is too disparate, and the future of the business is unthinkable. Yesterday, the Shanghai Flour Millers Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Inland Flour Millers Association held special meetings on this matter. They unanimously advocated appealing for the cessation of the collection. It is reported that the two associations received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, and have telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Department of Finance to cease the collection of wheat passport fees and release the Datong wheat ship. The Anhui Provincial Department of Finance has already replied to the Ministry that it will comply. Thus, the flour millers have reached a stage of resolution in the matter of waiving wheat passport fees.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Jiangsu Rice Association <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Ning-Shanghai County Rice Industry Association Federation held its tenth executive and supervisory standing committee meeting yesterday at Cuixiutang. The committee members present were Zhang Jingzhai, Zhao Zixin, Lu Zhuqing, Lu Gongquan, Chen Junyu, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhang Nianxuan, and fifteen others. Zhao Zixin was elected as chairman. After performing the formalities, the meeting discussed the proposal from the Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, and other trade associations that the Jiangsu Provincial Government promulgated regulations to increase business tax, distinguishing between rice and miscellaneous grains and classifying them for additional taxation. The association members pointed out that those engaged in the business of miscellaneous grains mostly also sell rice, and there has never been any distinction. Moreover, food grains are related to people's livelihoods, and it is unacceptable to increase the burden. The motion to unanimously strive to avoid distinction and additional taxation was passed. A petition was submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, appealing for the continued collection according to previous practices, to maintain the people's livelihood. Furthermore, the Wujiang County Rice Industry Association proposed that rice prices are falling daily, and the rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy. They requested that the association submit a petition to the Executive Yuan, appealing for permission to circulate rice grains in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, to alleviate rural distress. The motion was passed, and a petition was immediately submitted to the Executive Yuan, requesting instructions to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial governments to issue orders for circulation. Lu Gongquan temporarily proposed that the autumn harvest of this year is about to take place, and rice and grain production and income survey forms should be issued for investigation. The motion was passed, and the association immediately printed and distributed the forms to its members for completion and return. In addition, Committee Member Zhu Zixiang handed over a letter from Committee Member Zhao Zixin, with an attached petition from Hu Jia and others. Because the letter seemed different from Zhao's previous letters, he was asked to personally identify it. Zhao declared that the letter was not from him, and he did not know about the attachments. He said that he would strictly investigate who was playing this trick. The meeting decided that since Zhao denied the letter, the petition from Hu Jia and others should not be discussed. The letter and petition were retained by the association.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Baoshan Public Groups Oppose the Collection of Land Tax for Road Construction for the Province <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Joint Telegram was Sent to the County Government</p>
<p>Requesting the Provincial Government to Withdraw the Order</p>
<p>The Baoshan County Public Funds and Property Management Office, Education Bureau, Poor Children's Education and Welfare Center, and various district chiefs telegraphed the county government yesterday, stating: "We recently received an order from the provincial government that, starting from the 21st year of the Republic of China, half of the land tax collected for road construction in each county should be remitted as provincial funds, and that the county should report the remittance on a monthly basis. We are extremely shocked. Since the establishment of the Transportation Bureau (renamed the Office after the establishment of the Construction Bureau) in Baoshan County in the spring of the 11th year of the Republic of China, loans have been taken out for road construction. Over 10 years have passed, and more than 100 li of east-west and north-south county roads have been completed. However, over 70,000 yuan in public and private debts remain outstanding and have not been repaid. The Chengyue Road project was temporarily suspended due to the war and urgently needs to raise funds for construction. If half of the land tax is remitted to the province, the debt and construction projects will be seriously affected. This is the first reason for requesting exemption from remittance. Furthermore, when the city and county regions were divided in the 17th year of the Republic of China, due to debts and unfinished county roads and bridges, there were various related relationships. After discussions by representatives from the Ministry, the provincial government, and the city government, it was decided that the Transportation Office would continue to exist. The land tax for road construction within the city area would still be collected by the Shanghai City Government and allocated to the office for use. This was approved by the National Government upon submission from the Ministry of Interior. Currently, the land tax for road construction within the city area is still allocated to the county for use according to the original plan. However, the county area is now required to remit half of its funds to the province. This is not only unfair, but also risks affecting the agreements between the city and county. This is the second reason for requesting exemption from remittance. Moreover, the provincial and county expenses should be clearly divided and should not be mixed. If this precedent is set, the county funds will lose their guarantee, and county projects will be more difficult to carry out. Furthermore, the county has just suffered from war, with deep wounds and severe pain. Roads and bridges that were destroyed are being repaired, and funds are especially needed. This situation is unique. This is the third reason for requesting exemption from remittance. Therefore, we urgently telegraph and beseech the County Magistrate to review and submit this to the provincial government, to approve the reversal of the order, to maintain the debt and prioritize county construction projects. We await your orders with utmost respect."</p>
<h3 id="e166">Reasons for Delaying the Repair of the Tanjiabang Embankment <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Ouchu's Letter to Tang Chengzong</p>
<p>Mu Ouchu's Letter to Tang Chengzong stated: "Respected Sir, I received your telegraph yesterday, which stated: 'Recently, strong winds and tides have been raging. The embankments along the Wusong River, where the Japanese army bombarded, have collapsed. The Tanjiabang area is also collapsing daily. If a large autumn tide occurs, a major disaster is inevitable. The committee member has witnessed the current situation and is deeply concerned. Therefore, he urgently informs you, hoping that you will quickly implement the original plan and proceed as soon as possible to prevent any eventuality.' Furthermore, I read in the newspaper that you had issued news stating that a resolution had been reached, but it has not been implemented. After the Shanghai Incident, economic panic ensued, and funds were depleted, making fundraising impossible. Therefore, we had to work within the scope of the 810,000 yuan that could be raised, to address the most urgent projects. All the schemes have been examined and approved by the engineering experts and were submitted to the meeting for public deliberation. Upon detailed examination of the records, the Wusong Tanjiabang project was not within the scope of the projects funded by existing funds. Furthermore, out of caution, I personally went with Committee Member Zhang Xiaoliang and Committee Member Shen Xuansun to inspect the site. We concluded that although the Tanjiabang seawall was thin, it was high. Although the water flow was winding, it was not eroding. If there is no extreme headwind, there will be no danger. And compared with other sections, it is closest to Shanghai, with convenient transportation. In case of emergency, materials for emergency repairs can be delivered immediately. Therefore, we addressed the most urgent issues and could not take everything into consideration. However, I am constantly mindful of it. It is just that my strength is insufficient, and I only feel ashamed. Fortunately, you are also a member of the seawall committee and attend every meeting, so you must be aware of all the difficulties. Moreover, I would like to inform you that after the autumn floods of this year, there have been repeated storms. I am well aware of the importance of the seawalls in each section. Due to insufficient funds, repairs could not be carried out. There are many places like Tanjiabang. In case of an accident, I would have no way to face the local people and no way to face my conscience. Therefore, in addition to the post-disaster reconstruction projects, I raised tens of thousands of yuan separately and prepared materials such as wood and stone for emergency repairs. It is like using troops, where I have to draw a mobile force from the thin defense force. Now, the local area is blessed, and there have been no major errors in August. However, there is still a risk of an accident before September 18th. I am trembling with fear and unable to sleep peacefully. I respectfully ask you to consider that we are in the same boat, inspect the area at any time, and send a telegram immediately if there is a warning, so that I can supervise the emergency repairs. I would be deeply grateful. Respectfully, I wish you good health. Mu Xiangyue."</p>

<p>Charitable Organizations and Banks are Collecting Donations on Behalf of Them</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Association of Charitable Organizations for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees stated that since the September 18th Incident, Northeastern compatriots have been ravaged by violence for nearly a year. Their suffering is indescribable. They are now without support and without rescue. Moreover, the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang have recently been hit by major floods. Disaster relief and care for the victims are the inescapable duty of the Chinese people. Therefore, the association has been soliciting donations from all sides and has yesterday sent letters to various charitable organizations and banks, requesting them to collect donations on behalf of the association so that they can be remitted to the Northeast for distribution. A public appeal for donations will be published soon.</p>
<h3 id="e168">China's Coal Mines <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>China's coal reserves are abundant, but the mining industry has been slow to develop. Transportation difficulties often lead to wasted resources, while foreign coal floods the market. In Shanghai, for example, most of the coal used in the past was Japanese, resulting in a significant outflow of profits, which is lamentable. Recently, fueled by patriotic fervor, Chinese people have gradually begun to promote domestically produced coal, which is welcomed by the nation. It is also essential for the country to understand the overall assessed volume, as coal is a vital national mineral resource. Therefore, we are publishing this special investigation so that the people will recognize that the land is not stingy with its treasures and will work together to exploit them to their fullest potential. If they do, the achievements in the future will be remarkable. Let us offer our best wishes.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Geological Survey Institute, Shanxi province has the most coal reserves, followed by Hunan, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. Next are Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Gansu, and finally, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other provinces. The following is a report of the quantities:</p>
<p>(In thousands of tons) (In thousands of tons)</p>
<p>Shanxi 5,830,000 Shaanxi 1,000,000</p>
<p>Hunan 1,600,000 Anhui 205,000</p>
<p>Sichuan 1,500,000 Zhejiang 120,000</p>
<p>Yunnan 1,200,000 Fujian 150,000</p>
<p>Guizhou 1,300,000 Guangxi 500,000</p>
<p>Hebei 2,270,000 Guangdong 300,000</p>
<p>Henan 1,755,000 Jiangsu 190,000</p>
<p>Shandong 685,000 Jiangxi 85,000</p>
<p>Gansu 1,000,000 Hubei 130,000</p>
<p>Rehe 930,000 Suiyuan 460,000</p>
<p>Chahar …… Heilongjiang 160,000</p>
<p>Jilin 160,000 Fengtian 985,000</p>
<p>According to the above table, China has 23,435,000,000 tons. Dr. Drake's statistics estimate 996,612,700,000 tons, while Mr. Inoue of Japan estimates 39,973,000,000 tons. Although the numbers vary widely, it is clear that the reserves are abundant.</p>
<p>As for the mining industry, from the Guangxu era to the present, over the past forty years, there are still only a few dozen companies in the country organized in various provinces using new methods for mining. These include the Jiawang Company in Jiangsu, the Lieshan and Guan Kuang Bureau in Anhui, the Naizishan Company in Jilin, the Yudong and Muling Coal Mine Companies, the Changxing Company in Zhejiang, the Ludong and Zhongxing Companies in Shandong, the Hegang Coal Mine and Zhalannuoer Coal Mine Company in Heilongjiang, the Baojin Company in Shanxi, the Kai Feng and Jingxing Zhengfeng Companies in Hebei, the Fushun, Yantai, Benxi, Huwu, Huzui, Xi'an, and Badaohao Coal Mine Companies in Liaoning, the Beipiao Company in Rehe, the Fu Company, Zhongyuan and Liuhegou Companies in Henan, the Lincheng, Yili, Zhonghe, Zaitang, Liujiang, Mentougou, and Jimingshan Coal Mine Companies in Hebei, and the Pingxiang Company in Jiangxi. The rest are all small, traditional kilns, which operate intermittently. Even these existing dozens of companies are either facing economic difficulties or are being reorganized due to incidents. In summary, it can be said with certainty that most are still far from achieving development.</p>
<p>The situation of mining and operations in various provinces varies and is difficult to describe in detail. Shanxi province has the highest output in the country, so we will briefly describe Shanxi province as an example of the general situation.</p>
<p>Shanxi province is located on a plateau, surrounded by mountains, with an area of 549,200 square miles. Except for a dozen counties in the southern Hedong Circuit that have no coal, more than 80 counties have coal. According to a survey by the Geological Society, Shanxi has 2,370,000,000 tons of anthracite and 3,460,000,000 tons of bituminous coal. The counties with the most coal are Cheng, Changzhi, Huguan, Changzi, Gaoping, Lingchuan, Jincheng, Yangcheng, Qingshui, and Yicheng, which have 1,100,000,000 tons of anthracite and 210,000,000 tons of bituminous coal. Shouyang, Mengxian, Pinding, and Xiyang counties have 1,000,000,000 tons of anthracite. Datong, Zuoyun, and Huairen counties have 1,000,000,000 tons of bituminous coal. It can be said that there is almost no place in Shanxi without coal.</p>
<p>Shanxi produces about 2.1 million tons of coal per year, only 36/10,000 of the total coal reserves in the province. As for its testing results, the anthracite produced in Heshun County contains 0.58% moisture, 16.41% volatile matter, 28.89% ash, 54.70% fixed carbon, and 8430 calories. The coal produced in the Wencheng area contains 0.9% moisture, 18.7% volatile matter, 20.0% ash, 61.3% fixed carbon, and 7350 calories. The coal seams may either appear on the surface or have many layers. The deepest seam in Pingyao County has 12 layers, each about four feet thick. The thickest seam is up to seven feet thick. The sequence of layers is as follows: first yellow sand, then gray-blue sandy rock, then two inches of coal, then shale and white sandstone, then one inch of coal, then shale, then one foot of coal, then sandstone, then one foot of coal, then shale, then two feet of coal, then sandstone, then one foot of coal, then white sandstone, then four feet of coal, then white sandstone, then four feet of coal, then white sandstone, then one foot eight inches of coal, then shale, then three feet of coal, then shale sandstone, then four feet of coal, then sandstone, then seven feet of coal, then sandstone, then four feet of coal, and finally gray-blue stone rock. The tested composition and calorific value can reach 5678 calories. The Datong area in Shanxi Province has the most coal. Among the local companies, Baojin is the largest and has the most mining sites. The mining area in Heilongwumiao, Shigangzhuang Village, etc., covers 27 square miles and 90 acres. The mining area in Wuguantun, Jiangjiawan, etc., covers 47 square miles. Both new and traditional methods are used. The Jin Hua Company's mining area in Yungang, Shitoucun, Xiaoyutongcun, etc., covers 44 square miles and nine acres. The annual output is 40,000 tons of coal. The Guangxing Company's mining area in Gangou covers two square miles, uses traditional methods, and also produces 30,000 tons per year. The Tongshi Company's mining area in Changliushui Village covers more than 5,000 acres and produces 40,000 to 50,000 tons per year. The Yujin Company's mining area in Datong covers more than 5,000 acres and produces 150 tons per day. The Baofeng Company's mining area in Xiaomafengjian also produces 30,000 tons per year. In addition, there are more than 60 smaller companies, mostly using traditional methods, with annual outputs ranging from more than 10,000 tons to 4,000 to 5,000 tons, and the least producing 500 to 600 tons.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the coal mines in Northeast China are also very rich. Our country still lacks accurate statistics, but the Japanese have been paying attention for a long time and are doing their best to investigate. According to statistics, the three northeastern provinces produce 1,317,000 tons of iron, 9,250,000 tons of coal, 400 to 500 tons of lead, 700 to 800 tons of copper, more than 20,000 tons of magnesite, and 23,000 tons of talc annually. The unexploited coal reserves, according to Japanese surveys, are 4,209,760,000 tons. The current annual coal consumption in the three provinces is only 2.5 million tons, which is enough for more than 1,680 years. The following is a list of the locations and reserves:</p>
<p>Location Reserves Coal Quality</p>
<p>(In ten thousand tons)</p>
<p>Fushun 1,000,000 tons Lignite, bituminous coal</p>
<p>Xingan District 120,000 tons Lignite</p>
<p>Hewu Gang 1,500,000 tons Bituminous coal</p>
<p>Jiulantun 220,000 tons Lignite</p>
<p>Muling Mishan 1,000,000 tons Bituminous coal</p>
<p>Dongning 98,000 tons Bituminous coal</p>
<p>Central North Manchuria Lignite Layer 31,760 tons Lignite</p>
<p>Central Jurassic Fire Layer 200,000 tons Bituminous coal</p>
<p>Lafa River Coalfield 50,000 tons Lignite</p>
<p>Other locations 80,000 tons</p>
<p>Total 4,209,760 ten thousand tons</p>
<p>Given China's abundant coal reserves and limited mining, the demand for coal increases every year. Taking Shanghai, the largest coal-consuming market in China, as an example, the consumption was 1 million tons in 1918, increased to 2 million tons in 1924, and 3 million tons in 1929, and has continued to increase to this day. However, imports from outside the customs in 1928 were 2,432,932 tons, 2,281,230 tons in 1929, 2,467,042 tons in 1930, and 1,902,890 tons in 1931. In terms of value, it is more than 20 million taels of customs silver each year, with Japan being the largest contributor. In addition, there are imports from Annam, England, Hong Kong, and other countries. The extent of the outflow is clear. Those who are concerned about the times, with the fervor of advocating domestic goods, should take this important and major coal industry issue to heart and be even more vigilant.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Shanghai University Professors Inquire About the Sale of Antiques <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Professors' Association for National Salvation Against Japan (referred to as the Professors' Association) yesterday issued the following two telegrams regarding the sale of antiques, requesting the educational circles in Peiping to investigate the truth nearby, and requesting Yi Peiji to announce the truth. (1) To all middle and primary schools and cultural institutions in Peiping: Rumors are circulating that antiques from the Forbidden City are being sold. This matter is of great importance to Chinese culture. We, who serve in the education sector, should not stand idly by and ignore it, allowing petty criminals to be blinded by profit and consign the essence of thousands of years of culture to foreigners.

<h3 id="e170">Telephone Company Should Be Responsible for Line Disconnections <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special District Telephone Users' Association yesterday sent letters to the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the Shanghai Settlements, opposing the increase in telephone charges and the arbitrary disconnection of telephone lines. The two letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Telephone Company: We are writing to inform you that your company, under the pretext of replacing new equipment, secretly requested the approval of the Public Works Department to increase charges and to retroactively calculate them from three months ago. The city's users are in an uproar upon hearing this. Telephones are a public utility. You cannot rely on monopolistic rights to seek one-sided benefits. You should consider the interests and burdens of the public. The price increase is one-third for quarterly fees and one-half for per-call fees. At a time when commerce is depressed and the market is weak after the war, efforts are being made to reduce the rental prices of houses needed for people's lives, and the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is also considering exempting the general rate on which municipal construction depends. Why is your company increasing prices at this time and retroactively to three months before the fiercest fighting? This not only violates the principles of social economics but also breaks the established precedent that laws are not retroactive. If this can be tolerated, what cannot be tolerated? Our association is organized by the city's users and is the only representative body for users. After repeated deliberations, we unanimously deny the increase and insist on paying according to the original prices before the case is properly resolved to help your company's turnover. This approach is fair. In addition to having requested the Ratepayers' Association to negotiate on our behalf, we are sending this letter to you in the hope that you will quickly cancel the agreed price increase and charge according to the old prices. We also hope that you will not abuse your power and arbitrarily cut off telephone lines to maintain the spirit of a public utility. Otherwise, it will incite other incidents, and your company should bear the corresponding responsibility.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to the Ratepayers' Association: (Omitted above) Recently, our association has repeatedly received reports from users that the telephone company is refusing to accept old prices and forcibly cutting lines. This situation is enough to expose the company's reliance on the superior rights of a monopolistic business and its abuse of power. According to current laws, the relationship between creditor and debtor must go through mediation or trial by the court to determine the responsibility. The installation of a telephone is the same in nature as renting a house. The recovery of unpaid rent must go through legal procedures. Non-payment of telephone bills is at most a debtor-creditor relationship. How can the line be cut off directly, thereby preventing others from using it? This is very obvious (Omitted in the middle) How can the company force people to follow its arbitrary actions because it is not satisfied with its desires? Our association believes that the company's line-cutting is fundamentally illegal and is likely to cause other disputes and is not a way to resolve the price increase. We ask your association to quickly send a letter to the Public Works Department, strictly ordering the company to stop this illegal action. Otherwise, the company should bear full responsibility for any other unfortunate events that may arise. We are sending this letter for your information and consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Tailor Cruelly Shackles Apprentice with Iron Chains <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Apprentice Escapes at Night After Breaking Chains</p>
<p>Dai Jiabin Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Dai Jiabin, the owner of the Daishunxing Tailor Shop at No. 38 Juqing Lane, Xin Zha Road, and a native of Taixing, Jiangbei, needed an apprentice. His brother brought 14-year-old Huang Xiaolin from his hometown on the fifth day of last month to apprentice to Jiabin. He was left at the shop to learn the trade, but his treatment was exceptionally cruel, with severe reprimands at every turn. Huang, unable to bear the suffering, began to long for home. Jiabin preemptively, on the evening of the 30th of last month, used a very thick iron chain to suspend Huang from the beam, and used a thinner iron chain to tie his left foot and lock it, believing that he could rest easy and that it would be difficult to escape. Huang initially had no power to resist and had to submit to the arrangement. When everyone in the shop was sound asleep, he managed to break the joint of the thick and thin iron chains. Once freed, he did not hesitate, pushed the door open, and fled. When he reached Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, Patrolman No. 474 of the French Concession Police noticed him, finding it strange that he was holding a section of iron chain and that his left knee was also surrounded by an iron chain. He immediately took the boy to the French Concession Police Station and, after clarifying the situation, notified the Xin Zha Police Station the next morning. Detective Zong Weiting was dispatched to bring Huang, along with the evidence, back and arrested Dai Jiabin at the tailor shop for questioning. He then sent the child to Renji Hospital, where a doctor examined him, confirmed that there were several injuries, and filled out an injury report. Yesterday morning, they were sent together to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi conducted the trial. First, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that the defendant was charged with the crime of obstructing freedom under Article 309 and the crime of injury under Article 293, Paragraph 1, and described in detail the defendant's cruel and brutal treatment of the apprentice and the process of solving the case. He concluded that the defendant's actions toward his subordinates were reminiscent of the unenlightened masters of the past. In the modern era, such self-centered treatment of subordinates has long been eliminated. Even if students do not listen to instructions, they should be guided and persuaded with kindness. To resort to beatings is a great betrayal of humanitarianism. He requested that the defendant be punished as a warning to others. Huang Xiaolin then stated that he had come to Shanghai with the defendant's brother on the fourth day of the seventh lunar month to learn the trade. His parents were still at home. The defendant would often beat him with a ruler for doing things poorly. Now he said that I wanted to return to my hometown, so he locked me with chains. When questioned, the defendant Dai Jiabin stated that Huang came to the shop to learn the trade with a contract for three and a half years. He had been in the shop for nearly a month, and he did not obey his commands, so he reprimanded him. The night before, he had secretly escaped and was sent back by a friend who found him on Datong Road. Because he was afraid that he would escape again, he used iron chains to lock him up. Judge Wu examined the statements and found that the defendant's treatment of the apprentice was indeed excessively cruel. He immediately sentenced him to three months of imprisonment for the crime of injury and five months of imprisonment for the crime of illegal detention, to be served concurrently for a total of six months. Huang Xiaolin will remain in custody until his family is notified to take him away.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Fujian Provincial Salvation Association's Telegram to the Central Government <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Discussing the Standards for Reorganizing the Provincial Government's Personnel</p>
<p>The United Association of Fujian Native Organizations in Shanghai convened an emergency meeting to discuss the standards for selecting personnel for the upcoming reorganization of the Fujian Provincial Government. A unanimous resolution was reached to urgently telegraph the Central Government, requesting it to adopt the suggestions outlined in the association's previous petition to the Central Government. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, and Acting Premier Song of the Executive Yuan: Fujian Province is unfortunate to have suffered from banditry. Fortunately, the Central Government has compassion for the people and has urgently dispatched a large army, which has greatly pleased the people of Fujian. However, for years, the province has been governed by the wrong people, leading to political corruption, oppressive taxes, widespread banditry, and popular discontent. If we want the suppression of the communists to be swift and successful, and the aftermath to be handled properly, we must simultaneously reform the government and thoroughly reorganize the provincial government to save the people of Fujian from their misery. Our association has previously collected the opinions of the people of Fujian on political reform and sent representatives to Nanjing to present them to the Central Government. We are now telegraphing the standards that our association believes should be applied in the selection of personnel for the provincial government, as follows: (1) The Fujian Provincial Government should be thoroughly reorganized. The selection of the chairman should be based on seniority, prestige, familiarity with the overall situation of the province, rich political experience and ability, and the ability to take responsibility. Anyone who has served as a member of the provincial government in the past with no political achievements or who has bad habits should not be selected. (2) The selection of provincial committee members must draw on talent from throughout the province and must not be monopolized by one faction or a small group of people, leading to a disconnect from popular sentiment and a deformed political system. (3) The chairman and members of the provincial government should comply with the Central Government's resolution and not be concurrently held by active military personnel. (4) The selection of personnel for each department should be limited to those with specialized knowledge and experience in the respective department. (5) The chairman of the provincial government should not concurrently hold or remotely lead other positions. (6) Provincial committee members who do not hold department positions should be required to take turns going out on inspection tours and accepting petitions and proposals from the people and be responsible for handling them. (7) The chairman of the provincial government should not remain in seclusion but should go out to inspect various counties in stages to examine the administration and have opportunities to get close to the people. (8) The provincial government and its departments should implement austerity policies, cut redundant staff and affiliated agencies (such as the Provincial Security Office and various bureaus affiliated with the departments). (9) Local autonomy should be implemented within a limited time frame in accordance with the Central Government's order. (10) Attention should be paid to developing the social economy and seeking relief for unemployed people. We earnestly request that the above points be considered and adopted to meet the earnest expectations of the 30 million people of Fujian. This urgent telegram expresses our deepest hopes. The United Association of Fujian Native Organizations in Shanghai kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Factory Association Opposes Compulsory Arbitration <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Requests Assistance from the Bar Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory United Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Bar Association yesterday, stating: We are writing to inform you that Mayor Wu of Shanghai proposed to the Central Political Conference that the Law on Handling Labor-Management Disputes be revised to restore compulsory arbitration. The 319th meeting resolved to submit the case to the Legislative Yuan for review. Since the Shanghai War, labor-management disputes have sprung up like mushrooms. Although there are many reasons for this, the legal system is certainly not unrelated. Since the Law on Handling Labor-Management Disputes was amended, labor-management disputes in Shanghai have been decreasing day by day, which is clear evidence. Under the current serious situation, foreign goods are being dumped at an increasing rate, and domestic goods are as stagnant as ever. Both labor and management are suffering greatly. How should they work together in the same boat to seek improvement? Unfortunately, labor strikes are occurring frequently, and disputes cannot be resolved. Their efforts are no different than hastening their own demise, which is regrettable. The government has complete laws and regulations for handling disputes, and if the law can be enforced, there is no way to resolve them. There seems to be no need to blame the legal system. Moreover, the current voluntary arbitration system allows for objections to arbitration and appeals to the court to correct human governance by law. The intention is excellent and fits the national situation. If it is changed to compulsory arbitration, there will be no way to appeal if the arbitration is improper. Not only will it violate the spirit of the rule of law, but also the consequences will be dire. Our association feels threatened and cannot remain silent. We have already presented our reasons to the Central Political Committee, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry to strive to maintain the status quo and avoid increasing disputes. We have long admired your association's enthusiasm for maintaining industry and your thorough understanding of legal principles. We are sending you the original submission and copies of newspaper clippings, hoping that you will investigate and provide strong support. We ask you to raise your voice and be admired by all. The national economy and the people's livelihood rely on it. Respectfully, the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory United Association to the Shanghai Bar Association.</p>
<h3 id="e174">City Government Issues Ruling on Sanyou Factory Dispute <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the shutdown dispute at the Sanyou Industrial Society's main factory in Yinxiang Port, the city government organized an arbitration committee, which formally submitted the case for arbitration the day before yesterday. The original text of the officially announced ruling is as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Committee Ruling No. 20. Disputing Parties: (Labor) Shanghai Seventh District Cotton Weaving Industry Labor Union; (Management) Sanyou Industrial Society Co., Ltd. The aforementioned parties have a dispute arising from the closure of the Yinxiang Port Main Factory. Mediation by the mediation committee failed, and arbitration was requested. This committee shall handle it according to the law and rules as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Ruling: The Sanyou Industrial Society's Yinxiang Port factory shall restore a portion of its operations within three months, accommodating at least one-fifth of its original workforce. Before the resumption, the company shall provide workers with food allowances in proportion to their original wages. The remaining workers may be dismissed according to the original agreement, but when the Shanghai and Hangzhou factories hire workers, the dismissed workers shall be given priority employment.</p>
<p>▲ Facts: The Sanyou Industrial Society's Yinxiang factory, due to the sudden changes in Shanghai, was in a dangerous situation, and was forced to announce a complete cessation of work in all departments on January 29th of this year. Subsequently, the unemployed factory workers immediately demanded relief from the factory. After the ceasefire agreement, the workers demanded resumption of work. Management refused, citing excessive inventory, tight capital turnover, costs exceeding sales prices, and losses from the Shanghai Incident. Labor argued that the factory had substantial profits in previous years and recently established a large-scale Hangzhou branch, proving the development of the Yinxiang factory. Management's desire to close the original main factory disregards the past contributions of the workers, which is unreasonable. Workers, due to livelihood concerns, insisted on resuming work. Finally, the mediation committee proposed two options: (1) Restore a portion of operations, with the scale measured by the number of workers, a maximum of one-third and a minimum of one-fifth; (2) Dismiss the remaining workers, and prioritize hiring the old workers when hiring new workers in the future. Labor had already expressed its intention to accept, but management strongly rejected the partial resumption of work and requested arbitration. Meanwhile, the city government had decided that the management should provide labor with a daily food allowance of 120 silver dollars before the dispute was resolved. More than 20 workers, dissatisfied with the outcome, went on a hunger strike, expressing a final struggle. The dispute, which had been delayed for several months, became increasingly serious. Mediation failed. After the case was submitted to arbitration, this committee notified that a public arbitration would be held on August 31st. Due to some misunderstanding, the management did not attend, which is regrettable. However, arbitration is a public judgment, and summoning the parties is for consultation. The social bureau's mediation files show that the management representatives have repeatedly expressed their opinions, and the company's assets and liabilities have been thoroughly investigated and reported by accountant Xu Yongzuo. As this was not trusted by labor, the social bureau designated accountant Pan Xulun to conduct a re-examination, which is on file. Therefore, there is no need to notify the management to attend the meeting for debate or inquiry. A ruling should be made immediately.</p>
<p>▲ Reasons: According to the results of the audit by accountant Pan of Sanyou Industrial Society Co., Ltd., in the most recent three years, excluding annual depreciation, the surplus was over 132,000 yuan in the 18th year, over 218,000 yuan in the 19th year, and over 162,000 yuan in the 20th year. As of June 20th of this year, there was a loss of over 394,000 yuan. If the accumulated surplus from previous years and the public reserve fund, totaling over 195,000 yuan, are used to offset it, the actual loss is still less than 200,000 yuan. The depletion of the capital is only slightly less than 10%. Furthermore, the comparison of assets and liabilities of the company in the first half of this year was unsatisfactory to accountant Pan, who made a cautionary criticism. However, this comparison was similar in the 18th and 19th years, not just in the first half of this year, as evidenced by the asset and liability comparison table prepared by accountant Pan for the most recent three and a half years. Even if the Shanghai Incident losses are included, they are insufficient to justify closing the factory. Moreover, the issuing department is operating as usual, and the Hangzhou branch has not been suspended. It is inappropriate to close the oldest main factory with outstanding labor achievements. However, the company's losses in the first half of this year are almost equal to the total profits of the past three years, and its business prospects are indeed dangerous. Therefore, this committee believes that the final mediation proposal is appropriate, considering both labor and management, and should be adopted. Management should strive to restore one-fifth of the work within three months. The workers who cannot be accommodated should be dismissed according to the original agreement between labor and management, so that workers can seek alternative livelihoods. If the Yinxiang factory or the Hangzhou factory hire workers in the future, the dismissed workers should be given priority employment. Before the resumption of work and official dismissal, food allowances should be paid according to the original proportion to show sympathy, which is also the obligation of the management. This case was unanimously agreed upon by all members of this committee, and a ruling is made as stated in the main text. September 1, 1932, Chairman Luo Panhui, Committee Members Lu Jingshi, Shu Rong, Yang Peng, Zhao Shusheng, Xu Jileng.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Shanghai South Public Bus Company Issues Outstanding Wages After Shutdown <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai South Public Bus Company announced its temporary shutdown, the labor-management dispute has been resolved through mediation by party and government agencies. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Flexible Solution: The company originally planned to issue wages for the second half of August and 70% of the outstanding wages for March on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. At that time, the company requested: (1) Workers return uniforms and badges; (2) Outstanding debts should be deducted; (3) Workers leave the factory after payment. This led to a dispute. Yesterday, the Social Bureau sent Peng Zhenqiu along with Fan Guoren from the city party headquarters to negotiate a flexible solution with Jiang Wanping, the company's liquidator, and Zhou Anshan and Hu Jinshan, worker representatives: (1) Workers' uniforms and badges will be temporarily postponed, but workers must not wear them when not on duty; (2) Old debts will be temporarily postponed; (3) Workers leave the factory after receiving the money.</p>
<p>▲ Scheduled Mediation: At 4 PM, officials from the Social Bureau and the city party headquarters returned to supervise the company's issuance of outstanding wages to workers. The Liyuan Road Police Station of the Second District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police officers to protect and maintain order.</p>

<p>Labor and management both tend toward extremes.</p>
<p>After the strike of employees at all branches of Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store, mediation by party and government officials was ineffective. The Social Bureau is scheduled to summon labor and management for questioning today.</p>
<p>▲ Attitudes of Labor and Management: After the strike by workers at the Xu Chongdao Main Store and various branches, the management, in order to maintain operations, only the apprentices and associate managers of the Aiwunyi Road Main Store勉强營業. Each branch was operated by only the associate managers. The four demands made by the labor side, such as the dismissal of Qu Ming, manager of the first branch, would not be recognized under any circumstances. Labor believes that Qu Ming is the reporter to the police station, and will not resume work until he is dismissed or transferred to work in stores other than Xu Chongdao. As a result, both labor and management have gone to extremes, creating a deadlock.</p>
<p>▲ Interrogation Today: In order to quickly eliminate the dispute, the Social Bureau yesterday notified both labor and management, saying: "Regarding the strike of employees at all branches of Xu Chongdao Chinese Medicine Store, it is hereby notified that an interrogation is scheduled for 10 AM on September 2. At that time, each party should send two responsible representatives to attend the interrogation. This is to notify you, Wu Xingya, Director of the Bureau, September 1, 1932," in order to persuade the workers to resume work first and adjust the situation accordingly.</p>

<p>Workers at the Shanghai Electric Power Company demanded improved treatment and proposed six conditions. After self-negotiations with the company, they were rejected. Party and government agencies yesterday sent officials to negotiate with the company along with worker representatives, but there were no results. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Party and Government Consultation: Wang Manyun, Director of the Civil Training Section of the City Party Headquarters, and Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Social Bureau, noting that the Shanghai Electric Power Company workers had proposed conditions and their self-negotiations had broken down, in order to quickly eliminate the labor unrest, held a consultation at the City Party Headquarters at 4 PM the day before yesterday to discuss solutions. It was decided to send officials to consult with the company's manager along with worker representatives to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>▲ Negotiation Process: At 10:30 AM yesterday, Zhou Lianze from the City Party Headquarters and Zhu Guilin from the Social Bureau, along with five worker representatives from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, including Ni Wenfu, Fan Lisheng, Zhu Haoshen, Pan Genlin, and Jiang Zhengming, went to the company on Jiangxi Road to discuss solutions with Manager Hairte. First, the representatives of the party and government agencies presented a letter signed by all the workers in Chinese and Western languages to the general manager, along with six conditions (the full text was seen in the previous report, so it is omitted here), and first explained the reasons for taking on the mediation. Hairte believed that the conditions proposed by the workers had no room for negotiation. He had already replied to the workers that matters such as annual bonuses and pensions are stipulated in the company's articles of association and cannot be changed. After repeated persuasion, he rejected the demands by returning the original letter from the workers, resulting in no results and the meeting disbanding.</p>
<p>▲ Workers' Anger: After the worker representatives left, they reported to the workers. All the workers were very angry. It is said that a joint meeting of group leader representatives will be held on Saturday (ie, the 3rd) to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>Investigating the Actual Situation of National Products</p>
<p>The Shantou China National Goods Maintenance Association, in order to understand the actual situation of national products in Shanghai after the war and to unite with various national goods groups in Shanghai to jointly engage in a large-scale national goods promotion campaign, specially sent Cai Xiaotian as a representative to come north for inspection. He is currently residing at the Oriental Hotel. Mr. Cai also has other missions, such as participating in the abolition of civil war and the National Anti-Drug Association, and opposing opium monopoly. He has been very busy in recent days. It is heard that he will go to Hangzhou tomorrow before returning to Shanghai for investigation, so as to return to Shantou for reporting as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e179">National Goods Factories Association Requests Increased Tax on White Paper <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association submitted a letter to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, requesting an increase in the tax on white paper in order to protect national goods, saying that recently foreign paper prices have been falling sharply, deliberately dumping in order to overwhelm domestic products. If a remedy is not sought quickly, how can national goods be maintained? Paper comes in many varieties. The customs import tariff has always levied a light tax on plain yellow paper by quantity, charging nine jiao per dan of customs gold, equivalent to about 20 taels of tax silver per ton. The market price of yellow paper is 60 taels per ton, and the tax rate is above 30%. Various white paper grades are taxed ad valorem, at 12.5% of the value. Based on a market value of 160 taels per ton, the tax silver is 18 or 19 taels, and the tax rate is only 11% or 12%. This white paper is used for making cigarette boxes and snack toy boxes. Judging from the classification of taxable goods, it seems that it can be classified as a luxury item, and its tax rate should be higher than that of yellow paper. The Legislative Yuan recently proposed increasing taxes on luxury goods. If the white paper is also changed to a quantitative tax, its tax rate can be increased to at least 2.5 to 3.5 yuan of customs gold per dan. In this way, customs revenue can be increased, and national paper will not be overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Smuggling Seized Accumulated Soil</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in the early morning of August 29, Zhang Shaoyi, chief of the Stolen Goods Section of the Third Division of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, suddenly transferred a large number of packages to the outside. After interrogation by the guard at the bureau's gate, it was discovered that they were privately owned soil that had been seized. The 8,000 taels of accumulated soil sealed up had been replaced with other items. Chief Zhang, seeing that the matter had been exposed, insisted that he had been instructed by Han Jin, secretary of the bureau, and only then dared to do this. Secretary Han was skilled at evading responsibility and had already asked for leave. The matter was reported to Mayor Wu, who was furious. It is said that he has ordered Director Wen to place Zhang and Han under surveillance and await the dispatch of personnel to investigate.</p>

They previously wrote to the bureau to correct this. Now, the Municipal Council has replied to the Chamber, stating: "We have received your important instruction proposing to correct the name used on rickshaw licenses. We are pleased to know this. From October 1, this bureau will implement the change of the Chinese name of the rickshaw commonly called 'huang bao che' in the public to 'publicly used manpower car.' As for the license plate nailed to the car (commonly known as 'ying zhao hui'), the existing name 'huang bao che' will still be used until the end of the year. After that, it will also be renamed to be consistent with the aforementioned name."</p>

<p>At 8 PM on the night of August 6, the Russian newspaper "Shanghai Chaila" office at No. 551, A Street, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, was suddenly attacked by reactionaries who threw stones, soda bottles, and other objects, smashing windows and other objects. The assailants dispersed. At that time, the patrolmen and Russian firefighters chased and caught three suspected Chinese, Tang Xiangsheng (a rickshaw puller), Le Abang, and Wang Aqing (both coppersmiths from Huili Automobile Company). The political department of the French police sent them to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court, and they were prosecuted for the crimes of disturbing order, destruction, and endangering the Republic under Article 160 and Article 381 of the Criminal Code, and Article 26 of the Emergency Punishment Law. After the trial was opened, lawyer Wang Shizong was appointed to defend the defendants. The original debate had already concluded, but new evidence emerged, and the debate was reopened. The court summoned employees of the newspaper office for examination and announced the end of the trial, with the date set for the verdict. As previously reported, on the day set for the verdict, at 2 PM, Judge Lu and assessors Guo and Fan arrived at the Third Criminal Court, ordered the defendants to be brought to court, and ruled that Tang Xiangsheng, Le Abang, and Wang Aqing were all not guilty. During the appeal period, they were ordered to be released on bail.</p>

<p>Escaping Disaster...Seeking Help, Receiving Rescue</p>
<p>On August 31, the China Child Welfare Association received an orphan sent by Mr. Zhou Rongfu, requesting relief. After asking the child, it was learned that his name was Cheng Zhixiang, 16 years old, from Anhui. His father died when he was one year old, and he depended on his aunt along with his mother. He lived at No. 7 Chenjia Lane, Caidian River Street, Hankou. Because the Communist Party was causing trouble in that area, he and his mother fled, but they became separated on the road. He knew that his uncle, Cheng Zihuang, lived at No. 7, 5th Lane, Wenji Lane, Tangshan Road, Shanghai. He found his way to Shanghai alone, but his uncle had already moved due to the Sino-Japanese War. He had been stranded in Shanghai for ten days without food. He met Mr. Zhou, who brought him to this place, etc. When asked if he had any relatives, he said that his aunt's son, Yao Shouqing, worked at the Mobil Oil Company in Hankou, but he did not know in which department. He also had a brother-in-law named Cui Huisheng, who worked in the Yunmeng County Government in Hubei, but he did not know if he had moved. Because he had no travel expenses, he did not dare to go there rashly. The association only accepts orphans up to the age of twelve. The child was already sixteen, which did not meet the regulations. However, seeing that his situation was pitiable, he was temporarily sent to the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute, which is run by the association. A letter was sent to the child's relatives, and a notice was placed in the newspaper to help find them, in order to reunite the family.</p>

<p>The Liangyou Pictorial Publishing Company on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai publishes the Liangyou Pictorial Magazine, which specializes in introducing current events and local conditions at home and abroad, and has won praise from people in society. Now, the company feels that transportation is inconvenient in various parts of China, and the Chinese people cannot know the true situation in various places. Foreigners therefore have various misunderstandings and separations. In order to enable the Chinese people to understand the actual conditions in various parts of their own country and to promote Chinese culture abroad, the company has specially organized a photography travel group that will travel north from Shanghai, return from the northwest to the central part, enter Sichuan along the Yangtze River, and then to the southwestern provinces, taking pictures of mountains, scenic spots, social politics, and local customs. The chief editor of the Liangyou Pictorial Magazine, Mr. Liang Desuo, is in charge of this matter. Those traveling with him include photographers Ouyang Pu and Zhang Yuanheng, and secretary Situ Rongsan. The trip is expected to last six months and will depart in mid-September, traveling to various provinces and returning to Shanghai in March of next year.</p>

<p>Xu Yabo, the former director of the first district of the Minhang Water Police, was sentenced to seven years in prison by the Songjiang County Court after being extradited by the First District Local Court of the Special Region for the crimes of jointly robbing and receiving stolen goods with the already executed bandit leader Taibao Ashu and others. Xu's residence in Minhang, previously sealed off due to the seizure of military weapons, was approved for unsealing and return. Xu appealed the verdict to the High Court, which acquitted him after investigation and ruled to overturn the original verdict. Xu's family in Shanghai was extremely happy after receiving the judgment from the High Court through the lawyer handling the case. They were about to ask the lawyer to handle the bail procedures when the original prosecutor of the case appealed against Xu's acquittal. Xu's lawyer has already received the appeal brief from Prosecutor Wang Shicheng and is preparing to submit a response. Therefore, Xu Yabo will still have difficulties in regaining his freedom for the time being.</p>

<p>A Masterpiece by Lawyer Zhang Shizhao</p>
<p>Shi Zian, general manager of Yuansheng Securities Firm, colluded with Tian Hongnian, former manager of Zhonghui Bank, in acts of breach of trust and embezzlement, resulting in losses amounting to over 240,000 yuan. At the end of last year, shareholders Yu Shouzheng, Luo Kunxiang, and others pursued the matter in the first trial. The court ruled that the crime of breach of trust was established, but each defendant was only fined 1,000 yuan. The plaintiffs, dissatisfied, filed an appeal, represented by lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Dong Kang, and Peng Yuanxun. A few days ago, Judge Yu pronounced judgment, overturning the sentencing portion of the original verdict. Shi Zian was sentenced to one year of imprisonment for continuous breach of trust, along with a fine of 500 yuan. Tian Hongnian was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for joint breach of trust, along with a fine of 300 yuan. If the fines were not paid, they would be converted to imprisonment at a rate of three yuan per day. This information was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Lawyer Zhang Shizhao's appeal was widely praised. The following is an excerpt:</p>
<p>Yu Shouzheng and Others' Appeal Regarding Shi Zian and Tian Hongnian's Breach of Trust and Embezzlement, Filed in Their Own Name; Agent Lawyer Zhang Shizhao, Considering the Original Sentencing Too Lenient, Humbly Submits Additional Grounds for Appeal According to Law, Hoping to Change the Punitive Portion of the Original Judgment, to Uphold the Force of the Law and Punish Treacherous Merchants. Your humble servant, etc., are filing a self-complaint regarding the case of Shi Zian and Tian Hongnian, who colluded in breach of trust and embezzlement. On June 22 of this year, the Criminal Division of the First Special District District Court rendered a judgment (Case No. 395, Zhuang Di Zi, Year 20), the main text of which stated: "Shi Zian and Tian Hongnian are jointly guilty of breach of trust and are each fined 1,000 yuan. If the fines are not paid, they will be converted to imprisonment at a rate of three yuan per day," etc. It is evident that the original trial judge held a compassionate and merciful attitude, intending to use punishment to educate and deter. Your humble servant, etc., dare not disobey. However, Shi Zian and others are cunning and treacherous individuals, burdened with ill-gotten gains. Their lifelong habit is to recklessly squander the hard-earned money of others for their own illicit profits. The paltry sum of 1,000 yuan is, in their eyes, no more than a drop in the ocean. Punishment only restrains the honorable, while cunning is the forte of the petty. If one begins with a threatening appearance of harsh punishment but ends with a penalty that causes no pain or concern, it is like an arrow that misses the mark, amusing the monkeys. Ill-gotten gains are easily spent. The prohibition of wickedness will only nurture treachery, and the education of the capable will not correct violence. The state's goal of stopping crime and clarifying the law will not only be unattainable but will also have the opposite effect. The eyes of treacherous and deceitful individuals will be bolder and less discerning than ever. The facts are as such, and we dare not use alarming words to sensationalize. Several days after the pronouncement of the verdict, we heard that Shi Zian had gathered his business acquaintances and held a grand banquet to celebrate his victory in the lawsuit. Consider this: even though the penalty was established and his name was recorded in the penal register, he still called it a victory. What level of ignorance, shamelessness, and disregard for the law is this? One can easily infer more from this. The original judgment stated that if the fine was not paid, it would be converted to imprisonment. For those who have accumulated wealth through years of greed and spend money lavishly, using money to redeem their sentence is no different from giving away a hair. It goes without saying that the judgment is merely something for petty people to laugh and rejoice about. The state's use of punishment is originally intended to deter treachery, but it has ended up being manipulated and tested by treacherous individuals. How can one not lament this? Although your humble servants only pursue small profits, we know the boundaries of propriety. The loss of private property is a small matter, but the failure of the national law is a great matter. Fearing this, we dare not remain silent. Therefore, after receiving the original judgment, we declared an appeal to the original trial court within the statutory period and respectfully requested that the case file be sent for review, so that the presiding judge could begin the retrial. Now, in this supplementary statement of grounds, it seems that we should overturn and restate everything to ensure that nothing is omitted. However, in truth, we only seek to have the sentencing reconsidered and changed. As for the facts and reasons stated in the original judgment, after careful examination and verification, they are indeed accurate and flawless. Your humble servants, after reading them carefully, are filled with admiration. Since our knowledge is limited, there is no need for further elaboration. Examining the legal articles cited in the original judgment, there is indeed a range of possible sentences, and the fine can be imposed either separately or in conjunction with imprisonment. For example, Article 366 allows for imprisonment of up to five years, detention, and a fine. Furthermore, our country's code of criminal procedure is based on free evaluation, leading to a wide range of possible punishments for the same crime. The punishment that the offender should receive is determined by the judge's discretion at the time. The intention behind this is, on the one hand, similar to the principle of the Three Dynasties, where punishment was determined based on the specific circumstances (as stated in Zuo Zhuan, meaning that punishment was determined based on the situation, not by fixed laws). On the other hand, it contradicts the Legalist principle of aligning names with reality and adhering to legal formulas (as stated in the Lüshi Chunqiu). The benefits are widespread, but the harms are also associated with it. Why? Shi Zian and others have committed a crime under Article 366. Now, if they are told that they will be fined 1,000 gold, this is the same as telling them that they have committed the same crime. However, if they are told that they will be imprisoned for five years, the psychological impact on Shi and the effect on their behavior over the course of a year will be vastly different. Even a five-year-old child can understand this. Shi and others commit crimes entirely because they rely on their personal freedom to escape the law. The method of punishment should be based on the Zhouli, which places the person within a walled area and assigns them duties, which is sufficient to generate remorse and fear. As for money, it is precisely what they have hoarded in their chests. It is something easily obtained and difficult to exhaust. Whether it is Shi Zian or Tian Hongnian, who claims to have lost 240,000 yuan, who knows how much they really have hidden away? If the punishment is that they can be free of guilt by paying 1,000 yuan, then the wealth that Shi and Tian have cleverly seized from the public is precisely of this nature. If they can take one from a million and call it a punishment, then where would Shi and Tian not want to commit this crime? To reiterate, the 240,000 yuan they stole from others is now being nominally offset by 1,000 yuan, which is practically equivalent to being innocent. How many thousands of yuan do Shi and Tian have stored away to meet the need for such fines? Every time they spend 1,000 yuan, they can obtain 240,000 yuan. If these individuals continue to commit crimes again and again, will there ever be an end? The critics say that it is the court that encourages this. What will the officers of the law say? Furthermore, when your humble servants initiated the lawsuit in the original trial court, we consistently requested that the defendants be punished under Article 377 of the Criminal Law (see the first complaint and Lawyer Zhang's explanation of the defendant's crimes). The reason for this is that the crime of embezzlement committed by the defendants is based on a specific right, that is, according to law, contract, or care, etc., which falls under the so-called public or business duties mentioned in the law. According to this article, in addition to the increased term of imprisonment (seven years or less, six months or more), the fine can only be imposed in conjunction with imprisonment and cannot be converted to imprisonment. Now, although the original judgment listed the evidence of the crime in both the fact and reasoning sections, it was quite detailed, but the crime was only based on the article on breach of trust. The word "embezzlement" was not mentioned, and the origin of the business was difficult to determine. Shi Zian, as the general manager of Yuansheng Firm, has a very serious identity issue. All funds owned by the firm, whether capital, public reserve, deposits, or dividends, are all held by Shi Zian in his business capacity before they are legally distributed. The act of secretly depositing money into a private bank to evade responsibility is clearly a case of a custodian stealing from himself. It is a serious oversight to lightly treat it as continuous breach of trust. Even considering the breach of trust crime under Article 366, the sentence chosen in the original judgment is the lightest. Everything above that would have been more appropriate. According to Article 76 of the Criminal Law, when sentencing, all circumstances should be considered as the standard for determining the severity of the sentence within the statutory range. The so-called consideration of circumstances includes the causes, consequences, and intentions of the crime. Shi and Tian colluded as close relatives through their wives and abused their power to transfer funds from Zhonghui Bank for their own speculative purposes involving hundreds of thousands of yuan. The cause cannot be said to be small. Zhonghui Bank demanded repayment, and the appellants were unable to pay, resulting in the loss of their family assets and even endangering their lives. As for the current situation, the appellants have repaid Zhonghui Bank 150,000 yuan, and their other outstanding debts amount to no less than 100,000 yuan. The initial capital of 50,000 taels and the profits from previous years are not even being counted. The appellants have suffered greatly as a result, leading to the cessation of business. The consequences cannot be said to be insignificant. When the firm was in urgent need, Shi Zian claimed illness and fled, ignoring the firm's debts. When there were any deposits, he secretly transferred them to a bank that had no previous dealings with the firm. Even after the matter was exposed, he secretly instructed his partners to divide the remaining funds to avoid confiscation. In short, all the benefits went to him, and all the harms went to others. His intentions can be said to be extremely selfish. Comparing these serious matters with the principal punishment determined in the original judgment, it is clear that there is a serious imbalance. All of this has left your humble servants confused and helpless. We respectfully request a reconsideration. This is not a groundless complaint. Although business is declining and industries are withering, this is due to various reasons. However, merchants who do not abide by ethics and violate the law, treat all cases under the jurisdiction of the civil court as mere formalities and do not review them. They are skilled at stealing and hiding in multiple places. When managing a business, they do not invest in obvious assets, making it impossible to dispose of them and difficult to seize them. Those who follow the rules and perform their duties in the market are sacrificed and exploited. All of this is helpless. Such things are major problems that cannot be ignored. Therefore, the case involves more than just the private property of your humble servants. If we do not impose strict punishments and warn the world, people will stop working hard, and treacherous individuals will flourish. Since the opening of trade with foreign countries, Chinese merchants have been known for their honesty and integrity, but this old morality has gradually disappeared. When entering the world of commercial warfare, how far will the decline of Chinese commerce and the elimination of talent reach? Your humble servants cannot predict this. The presiding judge has keen insight and is determined to punish wrongdoing. Based on the above, although the scope of this case is small, its implications are broad. Who is to blame? Who caused this? Once clarified, it will be as clear as day. Without strict laws, how can diseases be cured? Without officials, how can diseases be treated? Your humble servants, fulfilling their duty as common citizens and thinking of the cries of the people, dare to request that this case be reconsidered, that the original judgment be overturned, and that the lenient sentencing be changed. If there is no leniency for crimes, there will be no trace of punishment. Then all punishments will be effective, and the law will not be a mere formality. The strong will be restrained, and the weak will be encouraged to do good. The atmosphere of the marketplace will be renewed, and the nation's vitality will be restored. Your humble servants pray for the country and the people even more than this. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>A Cantonese woman named Zhong Wangshi, residing at 1099 North Sichuan Road, took refuge with relatives during the January 28th Shanghai War. She entrusted her clothes and jewelry, worth over 2,000 yuan, to her employed maid, Qin Yushi, for safekeeping. However, Qin Yushi, seeing the wealth, became greedy and colluded with Zhuang Shilin, Zhu Dasheng, and others from Pudong to steal the clothes and jewelry and flee. After the case was reported, detective Sun Aizhong arrested Qin Yushi and the other three, including Zhuang Shilin's wife, Wan, and recovered a portion of the stolen goods. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. After repeated hearings, the court concluded the case yesterday morning and announced the judgment. Judge Shen Bingrong, presiding over the criminal court, sentenced Qin Yushi, Zhuang Shilin, Zhu Dasheng, and Zhuang Wan to one year of imprisonment each. The number of days of pre-trial detention will be deducted from their sentences. The stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff, Zhong Wangshi, after she signed a receipt.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We have reviewed yesterday's newspaper report of [Shanghai South Public Bus Company after ceased operation yesterday issued unpaid salaries]. It does not align with the facts. As for the issue of unpaid wages, representatives from the Party and government authorities announced on August 30 that they would be paid at 3:00 PM on August 31. However, the company authorities repeatedly delayed the payment. All the workers waited at the company until 8:00 or 9:00 PM, but the unpaid wages were still not paid. There was no police presence to maintain order. This type of news that distorts the facts is likely to cause confusion. Please correct it immediately.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e211">Savior of Marital Discord <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>For couples who are at each other's throats, there is no need to appoint a lawyer or declare a separation. Just invite two saviors, and they can be as loving as ever, transforming fighting chickens into lovebirds.</p>
<p>Who are these saviors? Not Sha Wujing, but Duidui.</p>
<p>What is Sha Wujing? Sha Wujing is also known as sand grubs. It is a type of caterpillar that can spin soil to create tunnels, creating an ant's hell, causing ants to fall into it and be devoured. It likes to sleep and is also called the "sleeping worm." If someone catches it and places it in the couple's pillow, it can harmonize their feelings. Chen Cangqi's "Materia Medica," "Jianhu Ji," and "Changtan Suilu" all say this. Therefore, Sha Wujing is the savior of marital discord.</p>
<p>What is Duidui? Duidui is also the name of an insect, shaped like a tick. It always travels in pairs, male and female, like a loving couple walking arm in arm. It is found in Yunnan, Myanmar, and other places. If someone catches it and sells it to wealthy families, it can often fetch a high price. It is then placed in a silver box and placed in the couple's pillow, ensuring eternal harmony and no chance of turning against each other. "Youhuan Yutan" and Zhan Jingfeng's "Xiaobian" both say this. Therefore, Duidui is the savior of marital discord.</p>
<p>Can these insignificant insects really be the saviors of marital discord? We will not know without trying. I advise discordant couples: even after taking a hundred steps together, there is still hesitation. How much more when sharing the same bed, pillow, quilt, and covers? If everyone can think like this, the savior is within reach, and there is no need to seek help from small insects.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Spiritual Civilization <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yiweisheng</p>
<p>Fellow countrymen, listen!</p>
<p>The idea of spiritual civilization has indeed harmed us quite a bit. Because of the concept of valuing the spirit and despising material things, we resort to spiritual civilization to resolve all kinds of unbearable situations. For example, some bad people are given names like jackals, tigers, leopards, poisonous snakes, and fierce beasts. These are merely metaphors for their wickedness and do not mean that they are actually these things. However, many people who have suffered at the hands of these wicked people do not have the courage to resist or retaliate. Instead, they secretly use the idea of spiritual civilization to comfort themselves, saying: "He is not a human, he is a beast, a poisonous snake. I am a human. Why should a human bicker with beasts and poisonous snakes?" With this thought of spiritual civilization, everything comes to an end. They endure all kinds of shame and tolerate all kinds of violations. From individuals to families to nations, they all use this idea of spiritual civilization to restrain themselves. Who knows that the person who insults you is still actually a human being and will never actually turn into a real snake or beast just because of your spiritual thought? You don't want to argue with him? He insists on arguing with you. He doesn't have to worry about turning into a snake or beast, but you yourself may become a cow, horse, or slave. Furthermore, even if it is a real snake or beast, if it comes to attack us, can we not respond? In my opinion, only children who are full of vigor and vitality do not understand what spiritual civilization is and have not been poisoned by spiritual civilization.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Philosophy of Giving Up Seats <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Jingbo</p>
<p>The Difference Between Young Women and Old Women</p>
<p>"Ladies first!" Why? Because women are weaker than men. Also, pregnant women and those carrying children may feel various inconveniences when walking, riding in vehicles, and in other public places. Therefore, men should give way to them out of a natural compassion and moral concept. When crowded, let them go first. In dangerous situations, let them escape first. In vehicles, let them sit down first. This is the moral expression that should be present in social life and the instinct of biological group protection. It originally does not involve the mixing of vanity and requests, nor does it look down on women as weak and incompetent. However, on streetcars, we often see that beautiful young women easily get people to give up their seats, while ragged old women can only stand!</p>
<p>Logically speaking, no matter what kind of young woman she is, if another old woman gets on a public tram or bus and cannot find a seat and is standing in front of you, and at this time, you and your friend happen to have two seats that you can give to them, you should of course stand up together and let them both sit. If there is only one seat, you should let the old woman sit first because she is the weaker of the women. The principle is very simple. However, because there is the gaze of beautiful eyes, the reward of a smile, and the request of a soul-stirring "thank you" or "excuse me," just like roads are specially designed for cars, giving up seats is almost exclusively for beautiful young women.</p>
<p>To reiterate: if a young woman is not beautiful, she is considered by most passengers giving up their seats to be the same as an old woman who can be ignored. In addition to not having the aforementioned requests, there is also the psychology of "no need to give up the seat."</p>
<p>The major revelation is: is the starting point of moral behavior between the concepts of "self-interest" and "class"?</p>
<h3 id="e214">The Wonders of Advertising Techniques <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Wanhua</p>
<p>A Good Textbook on Advertising</p>
<p>The great and miraculous power of advertising to attract business is almost unbelievable. In the past decade, our countrymen have come to pay attention to it, engaging in intense competition and rivalry to gain an advantage in newspapers. They understand that casting bait to catch fish requires only a small amount of promotional expenses to reap profits a hundred or a thousand times greater.</p>
<p>However, how can advertising text be made captivating? It requires ingenuity, discernible only by a clever and skillful mind. If we peruse foreign newspapers, we can see that their advertisements transform the mundane into the extraordinary, demonstrating that foreign advertising has kept pace with scientific development and entered a path of prosperity. Compared to the mindless "big discount," "big sale," "adding three inches to the foot," and "matching codes for half price" advertisements common in our country, they are worlds apart. I now record several instances of ingenious foreign advertisements as models for our countrymen to improve their designs.</p>
<p>In England, a general merchandise store one day published an advertisement in a daily newspaper, titled "New Marriage Method." The method involved dividing the store's merchandise into two categories, one sold only to men and the other only to women, each with numbered items, up to a certain number of tens of thousands. A particular number was designated as the lottery prize. Once all the items were sold, the store would identify the man and woman who both possessed the winning lottery number and introduce them to each other, arranging for them to become husband and wife, with a large dowry provided as a gift. If no match could be found, the dowry would be divided between the two parties. This attracted shoppers from far and wide. After the numbers were exhausted, the dowry was divided because the man and woman were not of suitable age. After three such attempts, a man and woman finally matched and married, and the store made countless profits.</p>
<p>Another store, seeing this and envying it, also published an advertisement, saying: "Our store has a daughter, just of marriageable age, with unparalleled beauty, seeking a good match. Anyone interested in seeking a partner is invited to come to the store for a meeting to facilitate selection." People rushed to the store. Indeed, there was a woman standing at the entrance, shaking hands with each guest as a greeting. Back and forth they came, wearing out the threshold, but those who came could not simply leave after a quick look, so they mostly lingered for a while buying things. The store's profits increased a hundredfold. After more than a year, they published another advertisement, saying: "The woman has met many people, but few have pleased her. The search for a partner is now concluded."</p>
<p>A man, heartbroken from a failed romance, committed suicide in despair. A gun store, hearing of this, quickly sought out a scenic spot with beautiful landscapes of water and trees, and erected a white stone tombstone, boldly inscribed: "[Mr. So-and-so, who committed suicide with the latest model pistol from our store]." The inscription then detailed the incident. Tourists passing by could not help but notice it, and the store's name became widely known, leading to a thriving business.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Praying for Rain by Kowtowing <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>

<p>President Sun Eats a Little Hardship, the County Magistrate Bravely Proclaims Action</p>
<p>Last summer, we suffered from floods; this summer, we suffer from drought. Amidst the cries of drought, I received a letter from my younger sister at home, which I transcribe below:</p>
<p>[Brother Qian:</p>
<p>...I am now telling you about a recent event.</p>
<p>X County, because of the prolonged lack of rain and the prevalence of epidemics, everyone thought of a proper way to avoid it. This method was jointly planned by the county magistrate and the people of the entire county. What is this method? I'm afraid you can't even imagine it. It turned out that they initiated an [association] that stipulated that all the people of the county must burn incense and eat vegetarian food, the city gates were closed for three days, and the county magistrate himself would bathe and purify himself every day, going to the four city gates to kowtow and pray for rain, and move the City God Bodhisattva out for a procession through the four gates, with the county magistrate leading the rear. That's already bad enough, but the most hateful thing is that our President Sun's portrait was also carried behind the City God Bodhisattva, parading around the city. In the period of political tutelage, they actually came up with such a gimmick! I grieve for China! President Sun's principles have not been implemented, but he has already been treated as an [idol]!...]</p>
<p>There are many more emotional words, which I will not record now. As for X County, located on the edge of X Lake in Anhui Province, it should not be subject to drought. However, water conservancy is not developed, rivers are not dredged, the mountains are bare, and there is no cultivation of forests. The county magistrate and party officials probably couldn't even dream of so-called scientific knowledge. How can there not be drought?</p>

<p>— Jiang Hongjiao</p>
<p>Mr. Wang also lived in this town, only a street away from Yuan Fenruo's residence. He was already fifty-six years old, and also a widower. His children had all died, and he often felt the loneliness of being a widower. Sometimes when he caught a cold and coughed, or when his back ached and he couldn't get out of bed, he especially felt isolated. He recalled the pleasures of family life in the past, and occasionally still felt sexual frustration. He had a strong desire to find a suitable woman as a companion in his old age. But he was very poor, and his age was too far past the marrying age. He was very disappointed, knowing that no woman would be willing to marry him as a wife.</p>
<p>But he was very fond of Yu Fenruo, and he couldn't think of any way to find out if she was willing to remarry, or if she was willing to marry a poor old man. Every time he went to her house to distribute or collect embroidery, he carefully observed everything about her. He felt that although she was a woman in her forties, only wearing plain cloth clothes, her face didn't seem to have completely aged away the charming beauty of her youth. Her house didn't have any good furniture, but it was tidy and clean. She treated the irrelevant madman very kindly and considerately, and her heart was very good. Everything met the conditions that Mr. Wang wanted for marrying a remarried woman, but the wages she earned from embroidery were enough to support herself and also to take care of Yuan the madman's life. She was very dignified, her life wasn't in a panic, and she lived her days very steadily, not needing to remarry. Mr. Wang had tried several times to miscalculate her wages and give her two jiao extra, but she was also very good at arithmetic and returned the overpayment to Mr. Wang. Sometimes he bought some soap, towels, and white sugar and sent them to her, but she only slightly accepted a portion, but she bought things of equal value and sent them back to Mr. Wang; and declared to Mr. Wang, please don't send things again, otherwise she would be unable to reciprocate, and could only decline everything. Mr. Wang's wish couldn't be achieved, but he didn't hate her because of this, but instead respected her very much.</p>
<p>Yu Fenruo's kindness was known to everyone; Yuan the madman's madness was hated by the whole town. When Yuan the madman was crazy, he would slap people for no reason, curse young women to become widows, or scold young girls for having affairs, or strongly pull the police to talk about her husband, so everyone hated him, was angry at him, and wanted to beat him; but Yu Fenruo knew, and would definitely go to plead and apologize for him. When people heard Yu Fenruo's words, they would calm down and nothing would happen. The police station repeatedly wanted to arrest him and send him to an insane asylum, but Fenruo would always persuade them to stop. When Yuan the madman was crazy, Fenruo often told him about his madness, and he knew that he had offended many people when he was crazy. He was very grateful that Fenruo was taking care of him like this, otherwise he might have been beaten to death, or captured and taken to the insane asylum.</p>

<p>▲Market Sentiment Turns and the Situation Frequently Improves Financial circles are unwilling to rashly release loans for any needs amidst the current commercial recession. Therefore, since the resumption of business after the first half of the year, everything has been generally contracted, and the situation has been lifeless. For more than half a year, there has been no good news to record. According to people in the industry, after this September, various industries seem to have hopes for development, and the need for silver dollar transactions can also be slowly activated. The market is expected to turn around, so yesterday, the silver and dollar markets both generally improved.</p>
<p>▲The Discount Rises and Borrowing Rates Increase by Four Points [Dollar Discount] The early market saw an improvement in the discount rate as the market turned for the better, calculated at six mace, eight fen, nine li, one hao, two hu, and a half, an increase of two hao and a half compared to the previous afternoon.

The Guangdong small dollar fell in the early market to five mace, eight fen, one li, two hao, and a half, and remained at the original level in the afternoon market, at five mace, eight fen, two li. The trading volume was 145,000 corners in the morning market and 55,000 corners in the afternoon market. Copper coins, due to the influx of supply-side supports, gradually increased, adding another 1,000 wen yesterday, to 434,000 wen, opening a new high price. The trading volume was 56,420 strings, calculated at a silver price of 13,000 taels.</p>
<p>▲Silver Remittances are Appropriately Simple and Complex Yesterday's bank remittances seemed inferior to the previous day, and the settlement replenishment was still around two to three million. Chinese merchants' remittances were two million three hundred forty thousand, foreign merchants' remittances were one million six hundred thousand, and various commodity remittance taxes and miscellaneous items totaled eleven million one hundred thousand.

<p>Prices are Extremely Stagnant with Very Slight Fluctuations</p>
<p>Yesterday (September 1st), the bond market on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw only one thousand yuan of spot transactions, with no other transactions. The October futures market remained unopened, and the September market was also lifeless. Inflows and outflows were extremely rare, with a total of 800,000 yuan traded in the morning market and only 500,000 yuan traded in the afternoon market, totaling 1,395,000 yuan. The overall situation remained unchanged, and the market sentiment became increasingly depressed. Trading was sparse, demand and supply were very balanced, and the trend was stagnant. There were only angular fluctuations between the various markets, with the results fluctuating by only about one yuan compared to the previous day. The calm and cold situation in the market was unprecedented.</p>

<p>▲South Shanghai: Yesterday, due to continuous rain, the sources of supply from various guilds were scarce. At the morning opening, the prices of new japonica rice and Zhongguan white rice increased by twenty cents. The price of fresh northern japonica rice was fixed, and the opening of rice from ships will have to wait for the weather to clear.</p>
<p>▲New Docks: About a dozen rice boats from Changshu and Xishan, carrying rice etc., arrived. Yesterday, at 4:30 PM, a survey showed that there were more than 250 rice boats near Hengfeng Bridge and Laji Bridge, each carrying about 80 dan (a unit of weight). The total amount was estimated to be around 20,000 dan. Affected by the rain, the rice on the boats could not be opened for sale. The prices of thin rice, northern japonica rice, and new japonica rice each rose by ten to twenty cents.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Imported Rice Market Turns Stable <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The Local Appetite Remains Good</p>
<p>Extension of Deadline for Reporting Transit Shipments Until the End of the Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, the appetite of imported rice merchants was sluggish. Merchants from distant regions were uniformly cautious. Some local households recently had wholesalers allocating goods, and their appetite was satisfied, but not enthusiastically. The entire market only saw small transactions of two small cars of rice going to Changzhou and other places inland. There were no other transactions. However, the appetite of the Japanese community remained active, and there were continuous engagements. Yesterday, the prices of white rice were high, and the intention to purchase was more active. A total of 1,500 to 1,600 bags of Saigon rice were purchased, with prices ranging from 8.80 to 8.70 yuan per bag. 1,500 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were sold, with prices ranging from 9.50 to 9.30 yuan. No other rice was sold.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that according to custom, after imported rice arrives, it must be reported to customs within a certain period. After reporting, the goods can only be picked up in this city and cannot be re-exported. Currently, customs will strictly impose fines to urge cargo owners to report. Yesterday, the Rice and Grain Trade Association requested the Customs Administration to extend the implementation deadline. It is said that the Customs Administration has agreed to extend the deadline to the end of the year.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Flour Market in a Slump <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the prices for all months turned flat and sluggish again. Quoted prices for imported wheat have fallen by about five to six or seven jiao for two consecutive days. Foreigners' confidence naturally turned quiet again. However, the major factories remained on the sidelines, without any action. Therefore, although market sentiment was not good, the decline was not too drastic. The smaller factories made slight sales, but the amount was insignificant. According to the current situation, the quoted price of imported wheat is the key factor. The actual sales in the domestic market are not given much attention. As a result, the closing price for this month was one fen lower than the previous month, October was one fen and two and a half li lower, November was one fen and a half lower, December was one fen and two and a half li lower, January was five li lower, and the opening price for February was 1 liang and 9 qian and 7 fen, with a better closing price of five li.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Futures Wheat Falls Six to Seven Fen <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon, prices for all months generally trended downward again. Quoted prices for imported wheat have fallen by five, six, or seven jiao for two consecutive days. Therefore, most clients considered selling back, and the opening market price was small. The factories were generally lukewarm because the prices were not cost-effective. It is estimated that there will be no intention to purchase until the price reaches the 5 qian and 1 guan level. Therefore, the future market trend is unlikely to be optimistic. As a result, September fell seven fen, October fell six fen, November fell five fen, and January fell six fen. Spot wheat has not yet opened for trading because the delivery period has just passed.</p>

<p>A report from the Sin Fung Foreign Firm states that on Wednesday (July 31st), due to the continued weakness in the New York stock and cotton markets, wheat continued to fall. The market prices are listed below (unit: fen):</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>September (Old Crop): 52.0 Down 1.375</p>

<p>Top-Grade Spring Cocoons Eagerly Purchased Without Remainder</p>
<p>Medium and Lower-Grade Goods Will Also Be Sold Out</p>
<p>Wuxi has always been a well-known cocoon-producing area. This year, both spring and summer cocoons experienced poor harvests. Moreover, after the spring cocoons entered the market, the sales of European and American silk declined, and financial conditions were tight. No one inquired about the new cocoons. Cocoon merchants generally transported their stored cocoons to Shanghai for sale or as collateral for loans. As a result, the inventory of cocoons in Wuxi was insufficient. In the middle of last month, silk sales by foreign firms suddenly became brisk. Silk factories started purchasing raw materials, and they bid up prices for European cocoons of superior foreign varieties. The price rose several times a day. In the middle of last month, the total volume of dry cocoon transactions reached several thousand dan. The top-grade goods have all been eagerly purchased without remainder, and the medium and lower-grade goods will also be sold out. Supply cannot meet demand. If there is no hope for a bumper autumn cocoon harvest, a cocoon shortage is bound to occur. Currently, the price of slow cocoons has risen to over 200 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Yellow and White Raw Silk Increasingly Popular <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the raw silk market in the foreign firms in this city became increasingly popular. European and American firms showed a stronger appetite for yellow and white raw silk. Due to the lack of raw materials and the scarcity of stored silk, market sentiment became increasingly popular. Yesterday, Xinfu and other firms imported 60 bales of superior-grade AB-grade 13-15 denier Shanghai white factory silk at prices ranging from 680 to 740 taels. Ganli imported 120 bales of Lingma brand top-grade No. 2 Qili white dry silk at a price of 625 taels. Dachang imported 40 bales of medium-grade 13-15 denier Fenlu yellow factory silk at a price of 600 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the English firms Jinlong, Xiehe, Yihua, and others, as well as the China Tea Company, which handle special green teas from Tunxi, Xiuning, and Wudong, showed a slight increase in appetite due to receiving reply telegrams from Morocco. A total of over ten zi (a unit of measure) were shipped throughout the city. The selling price did not change much. The market for Wubei Gongse special green tea remained stagnant. There were only scattered transactions of needle tea, show tea, and Gongxi tea. There was no major progress in the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Demand for Piece Goods and Woolens from Sichuan and Jiangxi Guilds is Strong <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangxi and Sichuan guilds showed a strong appetite for woolens and wool goods. There were considerable transactions in items such as plaid, plain, mixed-color, and iridescent Walter wool, common evergreen gray mixed-color serge, diagonal dot covert cloth, suit wool, plain thick Melford cloth, and three-four ounce frame overcoat wool, and wide and narrow striped camel hair, and the trading was very lively. Boxes were sent by parcel post through the post office.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Large Metal Ingots of Lead Surge by Over One Liang <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the metal market still felt flat. Although there were some small sales to customers, the amount was not large. Apart from necessary items, factories and construction guilds did not inquire about or purchase large quantities. However, the lead business was more lively than others yesterday due to considerable absorption by hoarding merchants. The details of the main items are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲Fixed Prices for Large Lead Ingots Soar: Yesterday, overseas telegrams indicated that large lead ingots were priced at 45 gold yuan per ton, a continuous increase of more than 5 gold yuan compared to the previous day. The market sentiment in this city was temporarily good, and the market atmosphere became stronger. Therefore, the standard price rose from 11 liang and 2.5 qian to 11 liang and 7.5 qian. Yesterday afternoon, the asking price even reached 12 liang and 5 qian. Although actual customers had not yet opened, transactions had already occurred at the market prices of 12 liang and 12 liang and 1 or 2 qian (mostly purchased by hoarding merchants). Therefore, the sharp trend in the market was unmatched by other metal products. The standard price of Hunan native lead, which had been rarely inquired about for a long time, also jumped significantly yesterday. The lowest price on the market was only 10 liang and 2.5 qian per dan, but yesterday the asking price also frequently increased to 12 liang. It was reported that 700 to 800 bars were offered on the market at 11 liang and 2 or 3 qian, which were purchased by fellow traders. The market price of 12 liang had not actually opened, but judging from the recent market sentiment, this estimate is likely to be realized soon.</p>
<p>▲Inventory of Galvanized Iron Sheets Depleted: Recently, the remaining inventory of galvanized iron sheets has been selling less and less. Therefore, the market trend has evolved into a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The standard price has been increasing steadily. Currently, the market price for 22-gauge is estimated at 9 liang per dan, 24-gauge at 9 liang and 5 qian, 26-gauge at 11 liang and 2.5 qian, and 28-gauge at 11 liang and 5 qian, all increasing by several qian compared to the previous market price.</p>
<p>▲Thin Galvanized Iron Sheets Declining: The market for thin British galvanized iron sheets has recently declined significantly, while inventories are abundant, causing panic in the market. The market price is trending downward. It is estimated that the price per sheet is 9 qian and 6 fen for 7 feet, 9 qian and 3 fen for the second grade, and 8 qian for 6 feet and 7 qian and 7 fen for the second grade.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Sugar Exchange market remained quiet. The atmospheric pressure for No. 24 Dutch raw sugar was slightly stronger, and the transaction price rose to 14 liang and 3 qian. Although there were not many transactions, the market was quite firm. Transactions of fine granulated white sugar at 14 liang and 3 qian and 7.5 fen were still brisk. The market for No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar remained the same, with very few transactions. Tai Koo Sugar B at 6 liang and 1.5 qian, CW mark at 15 liang and 6.5 qian, HX mark at 15 liang, H mark at 12 liang and 3 qian all saw quiet demand. PX sugar at 11 liang and 2.5 qian was quite popular, and the market has been reported as exhausted. Although the sale of Dutch sugar has gradually become active, the foreign firms Tianxiang and Dachang, which are selling off original raw sugar, have little hope of a transaction at this time because of the lack of strong intention to purchase from the trading houses.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Coal Market Sees Sluggish Transactions Due to Rain <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, transactions for various types of coal were sluggish due to rain. Sales of white coal were even weaker, and market prices softened slightly. Shanxi coal blocks sold for 15 liang yesterday, a decrease of 2 qian and 5 fen compared to the previous day. Red and white coal also eased by 1 qian. However, Jiangxi white coal remained stable. There was no fixed market price for Mack white coal yesterday, with some selling for 18 liang and others selling for 18 liang and 5 or 6 qian.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Strength <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The strength of things originates from movement. Without movement, there is no way to see its strength. However, if it is seen only after movement, its strength is no longer reliable. Therefore, those who are good at using their strength can predict it before it moves.</p>
<p>The German scholar Rudolf Eucken said, "Modern civilization is the civilization of strength. Strength is respected to the extreme, and it is used in every possible way." These words are indeed true. Therefore, if you want to survive in a world of competition, if you want to preserve your strength, first do not waste or divide your own strength, and only then will your strength be sufficient and complete.</p>
<p>Considering the dynamics in physics, the thickness of its strength can be measured before it moves. However, the more it moves, the more the strength in physiology increases, and the more the strength becomes apparent. If it does not move, not only will one's own strength not be expressed, but it will also be exploited by external forces, and its strength will not be able to be preserved.</p>
<p>Therefore, those who want to preserve their strength must first start moving. If you cherish this strength and do not use it, you are destroying it.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Quartz <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Xiaotao</p>
<p>You have already read and done a lot of manuscripts on physics, chemistry, and manufacturing. Now I will talk to you about minerals that are closer to people:</p>
<p>The sand and gravel that we usually see, the rocks on high mountains, are all made of quartz. Quartz is widely distributed and is also a mineral that we see every day. It has many uses. It can help those with nearsightedness and farsightedness see things, and it can also be used to make seals and decorations. I will introduce it below:</p>
<p>Quartz crystals are hexagonal prisms or hexagonal pyramids. Its texture is extremely hard and difficult to dissolve. It usually requires a very high temperature from a hydrogen-oxygen flame to dissolve it. After dissolving, it becomes a glass-like liquid, which can also be drawn into filaments to make various chemical instruments, such as flasks, funnels, crucibles, etc., as well as optical instruments such as lenses, etc. The things made are far superior to those made of glass. However, it is not easy to distinguish them from glass instruments. Generally, there are always traces of bubbles in the middle of things made of glass, but there are no traces of bubbles in the middle of things made of pure quartz. There are also methods for distinguishing hardness and specific gravity, but you have to break the object to test it. It is not dissolved by once-occurring acids, but amorphous quartz can be dissolved in hydrofluoric acid, and crystalline quartz can be dissolved in a mixed solution of hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid. It is made of a combination of oxygen and silicon. Because it contains many impurities, it is generally divided into three categories. I will describe them separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Crystal</p>
<p>Crystal is quartz with no impurities. It is colorless and transparent like glass. It is used to make optical instruments and chemical instruments. Although the things made are far superior to those made of glass, they are much more valuable. How are many colored crystals made? Those containing manganese are purple.</p>
<p>Those containing titanium are red. Those containing carbon are gray. This kind of crystal often grows in clusters in rocks or in mineral veins.</p>
<p>(2) Flint and Agate</p>
<p>Flint is what is commonly called firestone. It is named because it can be ignited by rubbing it. Agate is a translucent quartz with beautiful stripes. This is because it is superimposed with similar jasper, jade, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Opal</p>
<p>Opal is an opaque, non-crystalline quartz. Because it contains moisture, it is not as strong as crystal, flint, or agate. It is easily broken and is brown or milky white. Opals are polished into very good decorations.</p>

<h3 id="e242">Points for Improvement at Banquets <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ouyang Jinping</p>
<p>Banquets are a small matter, but there are still areas for improvement that we often overlook. I will briefly write them down for the adoption of the comrades in our discussion group.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>(1) Keep Time Strictly: Westerners value time the most. Therefore, there is a saying that "time is money." Chinese people treat the time specified on the invitation as a mere formality. We often see the host setting the time for dinner at 7:00 PM, but guests arrive at 8:00 PM or 9:00 PM, causing other guests to sit and wait, and the host to feel hungry and tired, with an unpleasant expression. This is not the way for guests and hosts to have a pleasant gathering.</p>
<p>(2) Eliminate Finger-Guessing Games: When guests attend a banquet, after drinking and becoming excited, they often play finger-guessing games, making loud noises and roars, as if they are crazy. This interrupts the conversations of others sitting nearby, and female guests are discouraged. This bad habit should be improved immediately. Those in the business community may talk about business conditions, and those in the academic community may discuss academic matters. Why bother with finger-guessing games?</p>
<p>(3) Refrain from Forcing Others to Drink: The ancient sage said, "Only wine has no limit, and excess leads to chaos." It is often seen that guests at the table use barbaric methods to force those who are not good at drinking to get drunk. After getting drunk, they may scold others indiscriminately or violently beat others, exhibiting all kinds of strange behaviors. Onlookers find this amusing. Unfortunately, if the alcohol causes an outburst, there is even a risk of blood vessels rupturing. I hope that we will eliminate this practice immediately.</p>
<p>(4) Should Have the Responsibility of Guiding Etiquette: When bringing children to a banquet, the elders should teach them etiquette, so that there will be no incidents of fighting for food or disturbing the order of the seats. Other things such as "do not rest your elbows when sitting side by side" and "do not mess up the bowls and chopsticks" should be guided at any time to improve the personality of the children and avoid being laughed at.</p>
<p>(5) Pay Attention to Signing the Invitation List: When a host throws a banquet, they always consider the number of distinguished guests listed on the invitation list to determine the number of seats to reserve. Therefore, all guests should sign "Arrived" when they arrive. If they have important matters and cannot attend, they can sign "Respectfully Decline" or "Cannot Attend," etc. It is often seen that people in society only write "Noted" on the invitation list, and the host cannot determine whether they will attend or not. Isn't this too much trouble in terms of pre-arranging the seats? Those who are invited to a banquet should pay attention to improving the small signing procedure.</p>

<p>— Fumin</p>
<p>Fight! Suddenly, a series of shouts and fights erupted at the entrance of the alley. Mixed with the shouts was the sharp cursing of a woman.</p>
<p>Running out the door, I saw a large group of people like a tide escorting the most high-spirited XXX lawyer in our neighborhood backward.</p>
<p>The crowd stopped in front of the local police station. Two people twisted the lawyer into the small police rest room, and in front of the station chief, they each stated their reasons and details.</p>
<p>At the same time, the crowd waiting outside the door began their propaganda work. They told the visitors who were standing nearby watching,</p>
<p>They were tenants on XXX Road and XXX Lane in Zhabei. The rent before the war was $11.40. Because it was located in a war zone, it would inevitably suffer considerable losses after the war. After the war, the landlord repaired the house and wanted to increase the rent, jumping from $11.40 to $22. The tenants could not afford to pay the rent, so he (the lawyer) sent someone to throw away the furniture, regardless of whether there was anyone in the house. He opened the door and threw it out.</p>
<p>"Humph! He reduces or waives the rent for his own house, but increases the rent for other people's houses. How can this be!" A fat woman said, spraying saliva as she put her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>"We must teach him to publish a statement in the newspaper!" A fat man with a bare chest and a protruding belly said, clenching his fists and raising his arms.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Right or wrong, don't beat him up first and then talk," a friend wearing a straw hat said, rubbing his hands together.</p>
<p>Because the matter was serious, the station chief could not resolve it, so it was sent to the head office. The negotiators came out. Four more policemen were added next to the lawyer. When they walked to the place where the lawyer lived, the lawyer drilled inside and went home. The crowd wanted to chase after him and grab him, but they were stopped by the gatekeeper. So there was a reaction.</p>
<p>Charge! With a shout, the people in the back pushed the people in the front. The people in the front were afraid of getting beaten, so they turned around and drilled into the crowd. Four policemen ran over and suppressed them.</p>
<p>After a while, the lawyer came out in a car. The gatekeeper took the lead and opened the way with a rattan cane in front of the car, scaring the crowd from daring to step forward to stop him. At the same time, many people supported him beside the car. These people, on the surface, looked like idlers, but in reality, they were all his subordinates. With great difficulty, they cleared a path, and the car sped out of the alley toward the head office. Afterwards, the crowd also flocked away.</p>
<p>Later, I heard that 21 tenants were arrested, but the lawyer came out without any problems.</p>
<p>School Scene</p>
<h3 id="e244">So That's How It Is <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Xiu Ye</p>
<p>Recently, I came back from school and suddenly saw a group of slender ladies in long cheongsams and high heels in our alley, in addition to a few familiar faces. I asked my family and learned that a XX Girls' Normal School had recently moved into our alley, and these owners of long cheongsams and high heels were high-achieving students of the school.</p>
<p>I have often heard the name XX Girls' Normal School since I was a primary school student ten years ago. No, it would be better to say that I have seen it, because at the beginning of each semester, two of their enrollment advertisements will definitely appear on the wall of our alley in addition to the [Yao Zuodun] [Double Magpie] and other recruitment papers; sometimes, our door cracks will also be filled with flyers introducing X people ... tuition fees are reduced by half to show preferential treatment. I heard that there are two to three hundred students now. Don't you have a big sign in our alley? My family told me, really, the big sign at the entrance of the alley is so big that it can cover the three words XX Lane, the name of our alley.</p>
<p>This school occupies the first and second houses at the entrance of our alley: its gate faces the road, and its body is an alley house, so this school can be regarded as being between a road school and an alley school. Although the house is not big, in addition to being used as classrooms and female teachers' bedrooms, it also has a girls' dormitory, but only for older students, probably because small students require a lot of manpower to take care of.</p>
<p>When I walked past their door at night, I often saw a few young girls laughing and talking at the door. At the same time, on the steps opposite, there were often young men wearing Western-style trousers and cloth gowns walking back and forth. Yesterday evening, when I came back from the cinema, I suddenly saw a group of people gathered at the entrance of our alley, not far from my home. Probably some Miss has committed suicide or the boss's wife has run away in the alley again, I thought silently, and at the same time quickened my pace.</p>
<p>As I got closer, I could see clearly that the people were all gathered at the door of the school. The door of the school was wide open, and many people were squeezing in and out. Following the sight of the crowd, I found a new sign on that big sign. The snow-bright gold letter sign has an attached XX Night School XX Specialized Course. Old Wang, who wears a red cheongsam and an apple-shaped face, also lives there, otherwise who would be happy to put on eight outfits and walk there every night, arriving a quarter of an hour early before class, just when they have eaten dinner, slowly attacking, enjoying it, a young man wearing four hundred degrees of myopia glasses was telling his companion in the crowd. I took a closer look, and it turned out that a few comrades who had been wandering on the steps opposite were all present here, each holding an application form in their hands.</p>
<p>Oh, so that's how it is.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Impersonating a Friend <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Dai'er</p>
<p>Yesterday, a man in a Western suit, about 40 years old, came to a certain family and asked to see the male owner. The servant replied that he was not at home, so he asked for paper and a pen, and wrote a note with the name of a certain person in a certain room of a certain hotel. As he was about to leave, he stopped again.</p>
<p>He asked to see the hostess. The servant took the note and reported it to the hostess. The hostess thought it was an important matter, so she came downstairs to meet him. The man in the Western suit immediately called her "Teacher's Wife" and said that he needed four yuan to send a telegram and asked to borrow it. The woman saw that he was a stranger and was very surprised, but since he was a friend of her husband, she should lend it to him, so she took out a five-yuan bill and gave it to him. He thanked her and left, saying that he would return it at six o'clock that evening.</p>
<p>When six o'clock came, the person did not appear, and she began to feel suspicious. When her husband returned home, he did not recognize having such a friend. She realized that she had been deceived. At this time, not only was the money lost, but she also received nagging complaints from her husband. She regretted it endlessly.</p>

<p>— Yongxiang</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang and Mrs. Wang were both uneducated people who liked to talk nonsense. They often made waves out of nothing. One day, Mrs. Zhang had a slight illness and asked Mrs. Wang to accompany her to see Dr. □ on □□ Road.</p>
<p>They talked and laughed all the way. When they arrived at the doctor's office, they registered. When the doctor was taking her pulse on her hand, they started talking loudly again for no reason. How many feet long should the cheongsam be! How many inches high should the collar be……………How beautiful it is! They were talking with relish, forgetting that they had come to see a doctor.</p>
<p>Hey! The prescription is ready, go and get it, the doctor said impatiently.</p>
<p>They were shocked by this shout and stopped talking. They hurriedly took the prescription to □ Pharmacy to buy medicine.</p>
<p>Hey! Sir, buy a dose of medicine, Mrs. Zhang said.</p>
<p>The pharmacy clerk took the prescription and looked at it. He said with a vivid expression, don't make a mistake, this is a pharmacy.</p>
<p>Sir, that's right! I'm here to buy medicine, Mrs. Zhang said in a questioning tone.</p>
<p>This paper is written with clothing sizes, not a prescription, the pharmacy clerk said with a frown.</p>
<p>Huh! Strange! Mrs. Zhang said in a daze.</p>
<p>Doctor, I asked you to see a doctor and prescribe medicine, why are you writing clothing sizes? Don't make fun of me, Mrs. Zhang said with slight anger and annoyance.</p>
<p>What were you talking about when you were seeing the doctor, the doctor said with a smile.</p>
<p>Later, they realized their mistake and begged the doctor to rewrite the prescription and went to buy medicine.</p>
