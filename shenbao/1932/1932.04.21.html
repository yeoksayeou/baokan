<p>邇近數年。以厲行黨治之故。政府對於輿論。箝制頗嚴。人民對於政治幾於完全無監督批評之機會。自去年七八月間。洪水突發。九一八與一二八禍變接踵而起。内憂外患。相併而至。國勢阽危。有若纍卵。政府悔悟曇者箝制輿論之爲非當。乃决然恢復言論之自由。使人民得以批評政治之得失與是非吾人認爲政府此種覺悟。實爲政府新生之機。亦即我國家新生之機　　雖然。吾人今日而欲評論政治之是非。究以何者爲其標準乎換言之即何者爲非。何者乃爲是乎。評論是非而無評論之標準與立場。則是非將愈以不明。而便政府日處於責難紛至。舉措莫定之艱境。益無法打破當前之難局斯説誠。故吾人敢以一言明辨是非。</p>
<p>吾人認爲欲明辯政治之「是」與「非。」秘以事實爲根據。必以「大多數人」</p>
<p>民之利益一爲立塲。依據於個人之感情而判斷者。非眞實之是非依據於個人或少數人之利害而判斷者。亦非眞實之是非。而不以事實爲根據徒作惡意之攻擊或謾駡者。尤非眞實之是非。</p>
<p>何以言之。事實爲最有力之雄辯。亦即不可更移之戢證亦惟依據重實而判斷之是非。其本身乃亦即成爲一種一事實。「一種不可更移之一鐵證」旣已有足以依據之事實。更基於大多數人民利場上從而分析事實之性質。合乎大多數人民之利益者爲「是。」反之即爲「非」此種判斷乃爲大衆之判斷。公正之判斷。換言之乃爲眞正之是非脱言者爲别有用意爲惡意之攻擊。爲非理性之議駡則言者本身先已無是非不明是非矣以無是非不明是非之人。而評論政治之是非。則政客耳。暴民耳愚妄之白痴耳人民固絕不至爲其所惑。政府之威信。尤不至爲其傷及毫末也</p>
<p>是故政府而欲明辨輿論之是非。必先體認輿論之是否以事實爲依據是否以大多數人民之利益爲立塲。政府而欲辯護政治之是或非亦必以此兩者爲明辨之根據。政府而欲博取人民之擁戴。尤必就此兩者作明白之宣告譬之救災。譬之補救將破産之敎育。譬之停止最近將行增加郵資之議凡此種種。政府皆能以人民之利益爲前提。以絕大之决心。决然以事實昭告全國則人民自竭力以謳歌政府矣。竭力以擁護政府矣。否則是非自在人心决非威權或巧言所能禁遏者也。</p>
<p>尤有進者。政府而欲明辨輿論之是非。必其本身先有是非脱其本身不明是非。徒以本身之利害爲是非。則輿論之所是者。皆將爲政府之所非是則政府與人民。日益背道而馳。其欲博取人民之謳歌可得耶</p>
<p>英政治學者拉斯基曾有言。「政府爲周諮博訪計。得力於反對者之批評」必較贊助者之誦揚爲多。阻塞人民之批評。即自種滅亡之根而已」斯言誠</p>
<p>有至理。誠爲名言。願我政府三思之。</p>
<p>今即取最小之一事而言。吾人呼籲黨政諸領袖一致團結共赴國難亦已半載於茲矣。假使黨政諸領袖。今日而果眞覺悟分離之爲非重新精誠團結以共謀打破當前之國難。則亦未始非輿論批評之力。未始非眞是非監督之力。眞實之輿論。果眞足以促起諸領袖之覺悟乎。吾人今請即取此一事以爲斷。</p>

<p>授權上海混合委員會</p>
<p>有資格决定常狀恢復</p>
<p>日兵應儘速退入租界</p>
<p>中國已接受日本反對</p>
<p>路透社二十日日内瓦電云、據東京電稱、日本將拒絕贊同十九國特委會授權上海混合委員會决定日軍退入公共租界及界外築路區域日期之决議案、此間聞之、頗爲震動、此訊傳至日内瓦後、國聯大會主席希孟、即於今晨、與中日兩國代表會商、至於混合委員會、並未授以專意决定退兵日期之權、僅令其表示對此事之意見、再混合委員會雖當取多數之决議、而今之决議案、令該委員會當力圖得一致之同意、决議案草案、現徇從兩當事國一方面之請求、授權混合委員會、於時機至時宣布、完全撤兵、能穩妥實行、並希望任何决議、須得一致之同意、如不能一致、則任何多數之决議、當作爲有效、主席亦有投票權、該案促請兩當事國具儘速求結局之决心、繼續談判、並懇求特别有關係之列强繼續斡旋、該案末謂、萬一不能商妥休戰協定、則當將全問題移交國聯大會全體考慮之、</p>
<p>國民社二十日日内瓦電云、國聯大會主席希孟語新聞記者、今日下午、曾與中代表顏惠慶·日代表長岡·晤商决議案事、料明日當可召集十九國委員會公開會議、頃閒又聞顏惠慶已接政府訓令、中國不反對十九國委員會所草之决議案、</p>
<p>路透社十九日日内瓦電云、十九國特委員今日討論一小時後、一致通過應付上海時局之議案、此案現將由希孟分交日代表長岡與中代長顏博士、預料雙方皆可代表其政府接受之、此後將舉行十九國特委會之公開會議、然後再召集國聯大會、俾正式核准此計劃、此議案長約兩頁半、但其主要兩點、一爲請日軍於最近將來完全撤退、一爲規定上海混合委員會有資格决定何時常狀業已恢復、如屬必要、可以多數票决定之、此案追述三月三日與三月十一日國聯大會所通過之議案、並聲明國聯大會特委會不擬辦理刻在上海舉行之休戰談判、苟撤兵事遇有任何重大困難、駐滬之任何列强代表、可通知特委會、此案並謂國聯大會議案具在、目前不能採行其他條件、非俟日軍已完全撤盡後、國聯大會議案不能視爲已被遵行云、</p>
<p>南京二十日專電云、國聯特委會對中日停戰會議所擬之决議案草案、外部已全文收到、二十下午汪曾召羅文幹及蔣作賓等會商對該草案之態度、經詳細研究後、已决定即訓令顏代表遵辦、該訓令現正在起草中、預料今明日即可發出、據外交界息、我國對該决議草案大致可接受、惟對於恢復平常狀態一節、認爲將來必多爭議、因我方認所謂恢復常態、祇可專指停止軍事而言、絕不能將抵貨運動及其他政治問題併爲一談也、</p>
<p>路透社二十日南京電云、中央日報今日雖載稱、國民政府不欲接受日内瓦十九國特委會之决議案、惟今晚據外交部發言人告新聞記者、國民政府已决議接受之、已電令顏惠慶博士接受云、</p>
<p>路透社二十日東京電云據今日此間負責方面消息、日本决不能依允日内瓦十九國特委員所制定之草案、因日本不能聽令混合委員會决定上海日軍撤退日期云國民社十九日日内瓦電云、國聯大會十九國委員會、在其所擬决議案草案接受中日政府答復以前、今日先於秘密會議時、議决、請上海中立委員團、重行努力、謀致中日雙方之接近、倘屬事勢所可能、即草擬關於回復平時狀態之報告書、迨認爲可以規定日軍撤退期限時、即行通知國聯、今日中國總代表顏惠慶博士語人、中國極願與日本談判上海事件、但若對手兩方中一方、正坐於另一方之胸腹上、如何再可談判、又謂、中國即於滿洲問題亦願討論、但若日本所陳訴者、在議程中竟居於重要地位、而屏黜中國所陳訴者於議程之外、亦如何可以談判、最後謂、渠意、日本對於施行國聯會章十五欵時、即將退出國聯之恫嚇、純屬空氣作用、虚聲恐嚇、因果退出國聯、將喪失太平洋各島之代管權利云、</p>
<p>電通社二十日東京電云、日代表長岡、將十九日之址九國委員會决議案之内容、於今日電達日外務省、請求回訓、芳澤外省以别項論據、覆電難以承認、并决將此旨通告、原來該决議、係十九國委員會隨意决定、無與日本事、且爲絕對反對、抑在滬之中國方面代表仁四國代表依該决議案、爲停戰之交涉、則無讓步之餘地、設該决議案不能成立、其責任全在中國與國聯方面、芳澤與政府首腦協議後、即訓電長岡代表對希孟議長通告取强硬態度、</p>
<p>電通社三十日東京電云日外相芳澤對十九國委員會之决議案、發出反對之回電、其理由謂、（一）决議案之第七條與第八條、將三月四日之總會决議、解作規定日軍之完全撤兵、全屬誤解、三月四日之决議、祇規定第一次之撤退、（一）第一條承認停戰交涉之該地决議、第十一條賦與混合委員會再撤兵之認定權、第十三條停戰交涉不成立時、規定提交國聯總會、凡此皆國聯干涉上海之交涉、（一）第十一條賦與混合委員會撤兵時期之宣言權、此實對日軍之行動、允許他國之肘掣、故絕對反對、</p>
<p>國民社二十日日内瓦電云、中國總代表顏惠慶、今晨十時三十分、訪美國務卿史汀生、晤談頗久、料係對於遠東時局交換意見、但究談何事、則未發表、顏氏别後、史汀生又延見法總理泰狄歐之親信奥培德氏、晤談至正午、嗣乃由史氏在旅舍、請英外相西門同進午膳、</p>
<p>路透社十九日日内瓦電云、國聯大會紐絲綸代表韋爾福與南斐代表華特、今日午後、晤美國務卿史汀生、對於遠東事件、作非正式之討論、南斐代表華特、前在國聯大會集議時、堅决主張國聯應用其所有方法、以阻止軍事侵略、聞渠與史汀生之晤會、大都發揮此種見解、路透社二十日倫敦電云、中國協會、今日舉行年會、主席邁爾斯發言、極力主張中國與國聯間之合作、謂國聯須參加解决遠東之國際和平、今此問題、方爲世界之患、國聯可以人力與財力援助中國、而不欲在中國成立外人支配權、但僅指示中國如何管理其自已耳、渠意、國聯居敎師地位、而非保護人地位、換言之、即授以新式行政技術、而絕不以保護人自命是也、中國可因外助、受益良多、而西方亦可因中國振興、獲取利益、蓋中國旣爲生産者、又爲銷費者、苟其境内安寗、則其在世界貿易中之活動、定將大增也云、</p>

<p>自由談歡迎蕭德太夫人  葉華女士　　　美籍航空上尉羅伯蕭德飛機師仗義抗日。不幸於二月二日在蘇孤軍迎敵。爲愛好和平之國家捐軀。世人哀悼之餘。莫不感極深刻之印象。十九日下午二時。義士太夫人愛利薩伯蕭德携次子愛特墨特搭大萊公司塔夫總統號抵埠。太夫人穿藏青嗶嘰衣裙。面紅身健。精神上殊憔翠悽愴。不勝悲哀。默念吾華無名英雄。不爲利。不爲名。爲祖國爭自由平等而殞命·所貴遺棄之萬千倚閭之老母。益增吾人無限悲傷。太夫人蒞海關碼頭行李檢查室。由政府代表及籌備委員馮少山·殷芝齡·周君尚·輩引導前進。電影公司職員及新聞記者。皆爭先攝影。自碼頭至太夫人行館華懋飯店。距離約一千二百英尺。民衆分立成行。熱烈歡迎。第一行爲男女學生。手執中美國旗飛舞摇盪。以示兩國感情。第二行係童子軍維持秩序。第三行則工商等團體各界代表二百餘人。凡佩掛白布藍字徽章者。可至碼頭口迎接。所以有此限制蓋免擁擠也。籌備委員懸有白色緞花徽幟。花心箝號數。下埀黑白飄帶。書有銀色「蕭德義士旌表委員會」」中西文字。形質兼佳。華人迎接外賓。如此熱烈。爲通商以來空前盛舉。義士有知。目可瞑矣。吾第一行最前線歐歡迎之青年學子。更作何種感想。外人猶爲中華抱不平而奮鬥而犧牲。生於斯息於斯者。對茲飄摇祖國。尤應有何種報答耶。捕魚者之殺敵  碧漪　　捕魚方術。厥有數種。或張網而漁。或　持竽而釣。或繫游泳之魚媒。舉槍以伺。或下芳香之魚餌。置簏而收。惟袒裼而探魚穴。則利用寒冬。魚多伏處。探手而入。捕之即獲。寒不能堪。則先服白信。（即砒霜。出信州。色白。故名）待熱度陡增。然後工作。便不畏寒。其老於此者。且用酒化白信吞之。苟非素習。必致殞命。此次暴日襲楊林口而登陸也。肆掠附近農村。人各鳥獸散。有老漁翁杜某者。素以探取穴魚爲事。至是。忠義激發。思殺敵以雪憤。乃以白信多許。置酒瓶中。而自取他酒以飲。以待。嘗聞人言。日人欲索我國飲食。必使具食之人。先自食之。防中毒也。旣而有日人三。蹀蹼至。見杜翁飲酒。舉手示之。作索飲狀。翁即向内取瓶酒。注杯中。日人又舉手作令其先自飲狀。翁舉杯立盡。隨取杯三。置日人前。三人乃狂飲。瓶將罄。翁入内。從後門出。有頃。偵視之。三人皆口鼻流血。死室中。翁乃拖屍投後河而逃。太倉周菊如爲余言。可敬也。短訊  莉　　奇獸記一片。爲美國最新出品。不僅以獅象虎豹等驚人表演見稱。而其情節之緊張。佈局之嚴謹。在在超出一切獸片之上。中有怪獸。厥名「比米」。爲科學怪人中怪人所飾。其表演尤爲出色。此片則在巴黎大戲院公映。聞並不增價。以示優異云。滬戰與軍器（十五）  一臧飛機的威力。旣認爲現代戰爭中唯一的利器。所以各國對於航空網的計畫。更進一步的防衛。譬如從前各國多偏重於港灣方面。到了今日。大凡都市附近。皆有飛機塲連絡防衛。因爲萬一發生事變。就可以對付敵機襲擊的危險。避免重大的犧牲。這是時代的推移。不得不然的。迴想到這次滬戰。日軍藉飛機的威力。到處逞暴。從開戰後由航空母艦輸送來滬擾股的機。計一百八十架。其中有百餘架。原係東北所有的。就是去年九一八事變。被其擄去一百七十六架。他們不費一兵一卒。得了這許多飛機。祗把機身塗漆。就來摧毁上海。誠使我們痛心極了。據東北兵工廠逃出的人説。被日軍擄去的飛機。不論偵察戰鬥攻擊轟炸等機。均極全備。而且多爲德法美三國最新式的飛機。其水平的速度。每小時爲三百五十籽。滯空十時間。上昇速度。達九千米突。又能装載重爆擊機二三　。炸彈二三瓩。由此可以推知東北損失的重大了。至於滬戰時。日機擾亂蘇滬杭的情形。記者已於三月十三日。將日本海軍大尉小田原的上海空中戰爭記。披露本報。故不再述。現在我把日本航空的組織簡單的一説。查今日日本的飛行隊。分爲兩部。在霞浦有操縱與整備敎育一處。横須賀有偵察高等敎育一處。他如館山·大村·吳·佐伯·佐世保五處。爲實施敎育的飛行場。最近東京灣附近。計畫增設二飛機場。共計全國約有六百架。航空人才逐年輩出。所以戰事一發。皆得自由措施。結隊而來。至於我國自民國八年十一月十日。設立航空事務處以來。形式上有航空敎練所。航空工廠。迄今已經過十餘年。試問已養成多少航空人才。然而全國軍閥。逐年由外購入的飛機。差不多也有三百架。（除東北外）但是他們各自割據地盤。擁兵自雄。不知外侮爲何物。從以一紙空洞電文。高唱力爲後盾。等到緊急的時候。都是噤若寒蟬。莫怪敵人要藐視我國了。國仇家仇（二）  王天恨　　雖然亂撞似的爬行。竟在無意中爬出了最危險區域。衣服都撕破了，兩隻手上和面上也破了皮，在流血。直到覺着兩手和面上疼痛時，纔恢復了理智，想：「母親呢？雄兒」呢？我一個人逃出來做什麽？」他又痛又慌！但肉體上的痛，終是小事，自已一個人逃出來，把母親幼子抛在家裏，不知這會子還安全不？却比肉體上的痛，更痛得厲害！他自已責備自已，怎麽竟抛了老母和幼子？他决計再回到危險區域去！　明知道他的居處已陷於砲火中，再危險没有！但一設想到七十歲的老母和十一歲的幼子，竟陷於砲火裏；更回想到方纔轟然一聲的結果，竟有那樣的爆炸力，如再擲第二彈，炸着了他的居處，那便怎麽好？他又何能懾於砲火炸彈的危險，而不顧老母幼子的生命呢？他决計再回到家中去，毫不遲疑，立刻就返身狂奔。可是這會子的情勢又變了，非常的聲浪固然仍充塞耳畔；但他明記得方纔逃出來時，槍砲聲還在很遠的地方響着，這會却近了，他在弄口所聽得並且掠過耳畔的蚩蚩掠過了。這會子却也聽得並且有一彈從耳畔掠過了。他只好仍匍匐而行；走不多遠，流彈越多，有一彈幾乎眞擦着了頭皮，伸手一摸，還覺得短髮上熱燙燙的，又不禁嚇得渾身冷汗。慌張地四顧，依然不見燈光，大地上完全被黑黯與恐怖緊緊地控制着，四周並無一人。但槍砲聲，飛機軋軋聲，喊殺聲，却喧成一片，就在四周不遠，自家被這種種聲浪包圍。他且行旦想：「這樣匍匐着爬行，總不會有何危險罷，方纔覺」得有一彈擦着頭皮，摸着熱燙燙的短髮，也許是心理作用，不是流彈眞擦着了短髮；前行！把膽子故大了前行！］　然而竟不能前行，他已看見戰塲就在前面不遠了，雖然兩軍的動作看不清晰，但那砲火密集的火光，是越黑越着得清晰的；而且飛到自家面前的流彈，也飛來愈多了。砲火是無情之物，他想：「自家固不恤犧牲，這正是報國的機會，難得本國軍隊實行抵抗很痛快，自家情」願加人作戰；可是老母和幼子還未脱險，這身子是要留着的；何况也不能這樣糊裏糊塗的犧牲，那只好别尋他道回家罷！」於是他伏在地　上暫憇了一回，用目向兩邊望去擇好了一條路。因爲他爬行許久，手上和面部旣破了皮在劇痛，又非常疲乏，不得不略略休息，再換個方向前進。商業新聞金融金市風狂雨暴　　消息紛紜掀起强大風波昨　金有劇烈之變幻、狂風暴雨、勢不可止、輒有數兩至十餘兩起仆、終日高低不下二十六七兩有奇、惟結果僅跌二兩有餘、然令人殊難揣摩也、初開即漲、蓋銀市報跌也、旋後曾超出七百二十兩以來、往後突起風波、茲聞路透電云、美國意想恢復一千九百二十六年間之英美匯兑、彼時爲四元八角以上、倘若英國不表同情、面美國擬將取消金本位、繼又得悉美國積極開銀行會議等消息頻來、是以同業萬分惶怖、大戶爭售、如若潮湧、殆匯票亦見鬆濫、頓見一蹶不振之概、慘落二十餘兩、猝已破進七百兩大關、午時忽轉和緩、復已回出七百十兩之外、實緣匯票轉穩、且聞某銀行又購現貨到三百餘條所致、溯自今歲以來未見之巨變焉市况之混沌、出於意外、後市頗形平静、交易亦鮮、因値星期三、匯票乏市、因之上落甚微云、今將統日詳况紀後、　　早間發現狂落自早六月份開盤、即加三兩三錢、爲七百十九兩、大條及美銀各跌八分之一、私電小去十六分之一、故人心向上也、裕和等咸來爭購、繳漲七兩、九點二十餘分爲二十五兩八錢、殆英金揭佈未更、美金小一二五、乃匯兑回落二分六二五之多、惟金價時爲二十四兩三錢至二十五兩、旋後賣方敏活、乃價一落四五兩、至十點後爲七百二十兩光景、頃刻間有種種不利金市之消息傳來謂美國恢復以前之匯兑、或放棄金本位等云云、人心大怖、如青天霹靂、而價續落三四兩、十點半後爲十六兩八錢、繼則站住爲十八兩二錢、俄而風浪又猛、美國極力維持銀價之説、塲上賣風尤熾、大德成等等莫不爭先傾售、不過半小時慘跌幾達二十兩、乃美金遠期以三十一元八七五、英金一先令八便士可售、直至十一點十分猝爲六百九十九兩之低峰、轉瞬買方見勤、因一般空頭乘此抵進、如恒興等均買、又聞其銀行開去現金、以此反向猛漲十四五兩、十一點三刻爲七百十四兩、迨午收爲十一兩八錢、揭價改爲七百八十兩、計撳五十八兩、後爲八十一兩餘、午時六十七八兩、　　午後交静轉定後市開盤十二兩半、次由十三兩二錢至十一兩半惟交易稀少、入後同太昌等上塲而進、倐漲三兩、二點一刻爲十四兩半、旋後互有二兩餘上下、惟匯票旣無市况故各號出納亦無巨數、至三點後大德成等前來脱手、價降四兩、三點五十餘分爲十兩零二錢、復後轉上、惟時有一二兩盤頭、迨四點半收市爲十三兩二錢比較前天續降二兩半、復又做至十四兩内外、乃零戶追進也、據全日最大價七百二十五兩八錢、最小價六百九十九兩、相去二十六兩八錢、揭價計撳七十兩至六十六七兩、登賬五六月間爲七百十二兩、因掉期業已扯平、補水十二兩、下午十三兩、赤條計加五兩、　進出敏活之至檯面上交易統計、順利·萬興·丙興·乾昌祥·福泰亨·義豐永均扯進、裕誠·同泰昌·源泰·成豐永·志豐永·福餘·元亨·元茂永·大興永·益餘·益豐均出、吳某時有出納、下午大都零星交易、大連帮及元茂永均進、大德成恒餘等則出、外匯先緊後鬆　　銀行内盤交易不旺　　昨日英對美匯兑略小二五、美匯英暴跌二分六二五、殆滙豐掛牌、英金未更、美金已縮一二五、香港加一二五、德滙小去七五、法郎縮五元、和匯减二五、印坡勿動、殆銀行内部亦已英平美堅、惟半日間雖有變化、不若金市之猛烈、自早間趨緊、旋後則鬆、午時復轉和緩之象、迨結果較前天、計英金彷彿、美金縮一一五、而交易不甚暢旺、實因金價波濤過烈、殊難措手、計英金約六七萬鎊美金四五十萬元、金業中出納不一、各行對做不怠、又孟買電進近期先令、迨下午因逄週三、向例乏市云、　　英滙内盤早午間有二五差次、自早開賣價一先令七辨士七五、買價八一二五、三井出五月七五、又出六八七五、（孟買出）麥行與住友互做六月七五、荷囒及住友互做七月八一二五、麥行與上海對做六月八一二五、東亞進六七月八辨士、午收出價八一二五、買價八七五、　　美滙内盤有六二五上落、近與遠期差三一二五、自晨初賣價四月三十一元、五月○六二五、六月一八七五七月三一二五、買價各加一二五、中孚·浙江互做六月二五、麥行與三井互做一八七五、華比買五月三十一元、三井買八月二五、華比·正金互做五月○六二五、中行進現期一二五、（大連帮出）匯豐進七月七五至八七五、午收賣價四月一二五、五月一八七五、六月二五、七月三七五、買價二五至半元、又掛牌一元、合銀三兩二錢五分二云、大條電告回長　　國民社二十日倫敦電、大條銀已見回長、計近期改爲十六便士七五、遠期爲十六便士八一二五、各比上日回大一八七五、又倫敦對紐約匯價改爲二元七角七分五、厘拆變動極細　　昨洋釐微昂半釐、計早市爲七錢零三釐、午市加昂三毫七忽半、形勢尚無升色可望、做出匯劃票欵早市五十二萬五千、鈔票四萬五千、午市匯劃票欵六十九萬五千、到市七萬、銀行買賣早午市一百十五萬、各銀行洋戶往來收解七十餘萬、銀拆仍開一錢、銀行掛牌四分、劃頭加水六七分、拆票交易一百八九十萬收解消息、計錢莊銀公單收解三千五百餘萬、銀劃頭欵收解二百三十餘萬、洋公單收解四百三十餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解一百四十餘萬、銀行收解計華商二百五十餘萬、外商三百八十餘萬、匯兑收解九十餘萬、貨欵收解一百四五十萬、押匯欵五十餘萬、關税欵收入五十餘萬、外商墊欵一百數十萬、小錢莊買賣三四十萬、輔幣交易江南小洋早市爲六錢零六釐、午市爲零五釐、交易早午市五千五百角、廣東小洋早午市同爲六錢零九厘、較前日跌去二釐有奇交易早午市十三萬零五千角、銅元加長五百文、爲四百十八千五百文、紗花紗銷無積極發展望　華南一帶已無多大去胃　棉紗市况、極其蕭索、各帮實銷岑寂、希望最大之華南一帶、以廣州金融大起恐慌、銀舖相繼倒閉、市面不安紗銷一層、又成僵局、人心愈覺衰弱、各廠極願遷就、津帮略有動辦、其他毫無舉動、市價日趨下落、底貨囤積日加、前途頗爲可慮耳、查全日各帮買去統計五百包、同行中進六十五包、行情跌二錢半

<p>本埠增刊談言	兩律師的訃聞  金　　我前日走訪一個月友，他的檯上放着甲乙兩律師的訃聞，一是訃其夫人的喪，一是訃其太夫人的喪，我無意中翻開一看，就發現兩樁笑話·　　一個訃聞中，稱其夫人曰太夫人，一個訃聞中，自已稱不孝嗣孤哀子，　　這一點極普通的常識難道身爲Ｌawyer精通法律的人還不懂得麽？　　（一）稱夫人曰太夫人，則其令堂萬歲千秋之後，將作何稱？必定要稱太太夫人了，旣稱夫人曰太夫人，則其自已必定要稱太老爺，或是太先生了，這豈不是一件大大的笑話麽？　　（二）我國從前喪禮通例，旣稱孤哀子，則不能稱嗣，旣稱曰嗣不能稱孤哀子，所以重大宗尊祖之義也，現在該律師旣稱曰嗣，又稱曰孤哀子，矛盾如斯，可發一噱，因此我友戲撰一聯曰，　　繼室悼亡，夫人曰太，尊堂尊閫欠分明，　　生慈侍下，不孝稱嗣，期姪期孫猶混雜，　　我看了這事，便發生一種感想，在該律師如此毫無常識，固屬可笑而在封建時代遺留下的污點，二十年來，還是不曾澈底肅清，深爲痛恨，現在普通的訃聞，大抵猶沿襲滿清虚僞而欺人的儀式，例如夫曰「不杖期夫」，或曰「抆涙」稽　」，或曰「泣血稽首」等等、多是種「装樣」而不務實際的表示，　嗪！同！彭！馬路上的大出喪，或是大結婚，觀者如堵，看看滿清的遺制也有，新式的軍樂隊等也有，光怪陸離，令人莫可名狀，但照我的眼光看來，各種上面多是粘貼着一張一張的，或是「袁頭」，完全表示金錢勢力的偉大，此外得不到一些任何意義，　　至於以上兩個訃聞的笑話，亦是中了封建時代留遺的毒，而又没有澈底的了角，所以弄得莫明其妙，令人哈哈大笑，惟封建時代有遺毒，原是處處可見，今天僅據一個例子，寫出來使大家來討論討論，庶後人不再蹈這樣的覆轍·大众文藝滬難新樂府  夢茹𥂝主　　縹緗刼　海内藏書幾家在，海源測皆湮淪，涵芬一樓最後起，崇樓兀峙滄江濱，宋元壞寳庋高架，絕域善本羅羣珍，分齋設案恣涉覽，明窗如雪無纖塵，能令寒士大歡喜，驅車排日來頻頻，一朝烽火逼江介，轟雷巨砲四壁振，飛車百彈破空下，赤　一怒毁典墳，鐵琴銅劍有孤本，可憐玉石俱遭焚，（吾邑瞿工善本）數種借與商務書館亦遭殃及（紙灰如鴉蔽天半，雲中髣髴號鬼神，頺牆嵂兀化戰壘，遺册亦供軍中薪，嗟自胡馬寇東北，心心刻意摧斯文，文潮一閣擁四庫，鬼車載入扶桑津，今茲涵芬刦尤酷，舊觀欲復知何春，私家更數周（越然）與易，培基）銖累寸積搜之勤，似聞池魚亦殃及，凡我識字皆酸辛，吁嗟乎，縹緗一炬哀絳雲，三百年來今再聞，聞説  陳伯英毁家萬戶盡吞聲、海上檴輸又一枰、已見吾民成左袵、却開大會議西京、援師雅作蝸牛躅、藎畫難求仗馬鳴、聞説羣公心事定、十洲華屋早經營、大衆科學誰是他的父親  國儒　　私生子因父族不明而起法律上的糾紛、在中國向來偏重男權的社會裏、可説是極不易有、即或有之、情形亦很單簡、裁判人祗須按照我們中國幾千年來的倫敎習俗、再加以心理推測、隨隨便便判下去、也不會有人不服的、因爲中國人缺乏科學常識、受屈的人、就明知受屈、亦無從自白其冤、　　這種父族不明的糾紛、在歐美婦女已得自由的社會裏、是常有的事、特别是在這不景氣普遍全世、勞苦大衆貧困化更加深刻的時候、私生子爲給養問題而發生證明父族的糾紛特别多、且情形亦很複雜、往往有一個私子、涉及一個以上被疑爲父的男子、私生子的母親、在法律上雖亦有指認父族之權、但如得不着科學上的證明時、亦不是絕對正確的、　有蘭德斯坦博士者Ｄr·Landsteirro爲此問題、曾盡其多年之精力、將世界人類的血、用科學方法作過一次大的研究、他的結果、能將世界人類的血、依其性質之不同、大别爲Ａ·Ｂ·ＡＢ·Ｏ·四族、此四族中、屬Ｏ·族Ａ族的、以北美與蘇俄爲特多、以全世界計算、Ｏ·Ａ兩族各佔百分之四十、Ｂ·族佔百分之十五、其餘百分之五屬ＡＢ族、　　如從一個的血内、用法將他的血球晳出、投入他一人之血清内Ｓerum·（按血在低温度裏静置數鐘、血球即凝固沈下、透明的血清液體、即浮於上、分晳甚易）放在顯徴鏡下窺之、則視此二人血族之同否、可得兩種不同的現象、如兩人同屬一血族、例如父子、則第一人之血球在第二人之血清内、均匀散布、呈常血液狀態、反之、則第一人之血球、在第二人血清内、凝結爲團、不自均匀分散、蘭德斯坦各種血族反應的發明、在證明父族與證明殺傷案之凶手時、雖常引用、還不是解决這種問題的絕對方法、因爲懷疑者之血或在他的衣屨上尋得的血跡、與小孩之血或被殺害者之血不同一族時、自然可作受疑者與該案無關之絕對證明、反之若同爲一族時、亦不能即認爲該私生子之親父或殺案之凶手、因爲世上與該孩親父或殺案凶手之血同族者尚多故耳、因此最近又有兩關於血的新發明、　　（一）凡有血族關係人的血、經一定手續用一定方式滴於濾紙上、在血的浸紋及乾後的血痕上、可以看出相似之點、　　（二）凡有血族關係人的分泌液相混和、清而透明、反之濁而不透明、倘經以上種種試騐而得同一結果、懷疑者與本案有關否、自然明白、　　蘭氏人類血族分四種的發明、應用在醫學上、凡從前因内出血或外出血過多、又患貧血症者而致血壓不足、非死不可的人、現在可尋一與他同一血族者、借取相當血量、注入血管内、加高血壓、練心臟繼續工作、得免於死、隨便談談二房東的好機  會吾　　當十九路軍還未退出閘北之前、我懷着不能平静的心情，去静安寺路探望一家孤兒寡婦的親戚。他們因爲貧窮底原故，只能賃租一同矮小的給煤烟薰黑了的灶披間，這使我每次去訪問都得爲他們痛心底。照例；我剛一坐下，六歲的小姪兒便立刻坐在我底身上糾纒着，我底表嫂便哀訴近來生活底苦况：可是這次小姪兒不幸染着了疹子，自然這更增加了表嫂悲哀了，不久我們便開始了如下的談話；　　「我們現在眞是没有辦法，因爲戰爭」底關係，一切日常生活必需品，都突然、的抬高市價；這且不去説它，同時我底刻毒的二房東却在這時候要辭退我底房子哩！」　　「噢？你又不欠房租。」我眞覺得奇怪起來。　　「哎，你還不知道，因爲現在的房租」貴了，而且我底房租又是相當的便宜。……」　　「啊！……」　　「最近，因爲這一帶增加了許多由北」川路來的廣東人，他們多是有錢的，同時又没有空房子可租，於是一班二房東便乘機「奇貨可居」的抬高房租了。就像我們家裏底前客堂，原來是二房東自已做客廳用的，可是現在却情願自已不用，租給那些復旦大學學生，房租是四十六元，還有小小的亭子間也是十八元。這一幢房子也不過三十二元、這樣一來，二房東便可以白住房子而且還有錢賺。我因爲是老房客，房租只七元錢，……「啊！對了，現在至少好租十六元了。」」我不待他説完便搶着接下去了。　　「我底房東眞壞哩；不久以前，聽説」他假借募捐援助十九路軍還賺了不少的捐欵喲！」　　我眞佩服這位先生的本領，不禁啞然無語。最後我底表嫂還補充着説；　　「現在敎我帶着這小孩子搬到那裏去」呢？無論怎樣小的房子也得十五六元啊！這怎麽好呢？」　　我簡直没有適當的方法可以爲他解圍，大家都在戰爭中，眞是没有辦法的事體。　　然而今天戰事已是風平浪静了，一般的市民似乎都在樂享昇平了，但是戰區内還是敗瓦頽垣，所以，我想那些趁火打刦的二房東底好機會，將仍是繼續綿延而亦或時憂懼這時機之不再吧！東力南北三個銅板的頭等人  白匍夜色蒼蒼，我匆忙的挾着一包書踏上電車，三等車箱裏黑壓壓的装滿一惟人，連個縫隙兒也没有，弄得烏烟瘴氣，臭氣觸鼻）當然，這裏面没有高貴仕士，也没有花花少爺，聞不到香味。）我費了九牛二虎之力，經過好幾次苦心的奮鬥，才立住脚，拉住一個籐環。突然從我後面來了一位内穿西装外披黑大氅的大爺，目無兵丁的向前擁來，而且嚷着；「走開！走開！」他走到二門關竚立下來「瑯瑯」的用手指敲擊玻璃門，而且用目睃着售票員喊着，我被他這大摇大擺的一擠又被他這一喧擾，不覺證了他幾眼。眼看偌大的頭等車箱裏，只有三個人，，一位摩登少女在打開手提包在揸粉書唇；一位大肚子的外國太太還有一位就是這位大爺，他在少女旁邊落了坐。　　在我旁邊有一位戴尖皮瓜帽的小商人説；「從這里到静安寺頭等」車要多三個銅板！」　我想，好一位三個銅板買來的頭等人！銅版雖然三個，但階級却分得十分顯明呢！市塲訊　秋據樓詩稿預售秋據樓詩稿、爲陳伯英君所著、都一百餘首、内中新亭一集撫事感時、尤多慷慨激楚之音、装訂古雅、將於五月一日出版、定價五角、茲爲優待讀者起見、凡於五月一日以前先行酉購者、每册祇收大洋三角、出版後即當由郵寄上不誤、其通訊處爲阿拉白司脱路一七五號、　　中國牙醫材料公司遷移南京路雲南路口中國牙醫材料公司、專售歐美各國牙科一切器械材料、素以物美價廉、馳史海内、茲因原址翻造、已遷至廣西路二百二十九號（即先施新新公司）横街）新屋照常營業、公佈欄高等法院第二分院　　民事判决一件馬郭氏與馬文耀等因供給赡養費涉訟一案（主文）上訴駁斥第二審訴訟費用由上訴人負担　　刑事判决一件鄭寳榮等與康阿毛因誣告及妨害名譽一案（主文）上訴駁回▲一件李大廣子因强盜一案（主文）上訴駁回公示送達一件東省鐵路事務所與程詠裳等爲賠償上訴案件本院定於六月十六日下午二時爲公開審理日期除選任陶一民律師爲該被上訴人特别代理人外仰該被上訴人遵期到院辯論毋自延誤特此公示送達右仰被上訴人邱尼亨知照▲一件謝子敏因陸大豐自訴侵占提起上訴一案業經本院判决因陸大豐住址不明文件無從送達茲將應收判决正本特爲依法公示送達右仰自訴人陸大豐知照（四月十）九日）高等法院第三分院　　民事一件爲廣昌安餘僣逖百克欠租涉訟上訴一案本院判决如左主文上訴駁斥第三審訴訟費用由上訴人負担一件爲呂鴻逵與楊芳莘即楊訪莘因票欵涉訟上訴一案本院判决如左主文原判决關於駁斥上訴及負担訟費之部分廢棄發回江蘇上海第二特區地方法院更爲審判、（四月）十九日）上海第一特區地方法院　　刑事第一審判决一·老閘捕房訴張方氏持有鴉片案（主文）張方氏持有鴉片罪處罰金二十元經强制執行而未完納以二元折算一日易科監禁鴉片烟没收之二·虹口捕房訴徐瑞岳等賭博案（主文）徐瑞岳奚阿炳賭博罪各處罰金三十元周裕卿李敎全賭博罪各處罰金十五元經强制執行如不完納以二元折算一日易科監禁賭具賭資均没收·三老閘捕房訴王許氏持有鴉片案（主文））王許氏持有鴉片罪處罰金三十元鴉片烟土一宗没收·四匯司捕房訴謝輝章持有鴉片案（主文））謝輝章持有鴉片罪處罰金五十元如不完納以捕房訴蔡學貴竊盜嫌疑案（主文）蔡學貴無罪六·總巡捕房訴張鴻生竊盜案（主文）張鴻生竊盜罪處徒刑二月七·總巡捕房訴劉國香竊盜案（主）文）劉國香竊盜罪處有期徒刑五月八·老閘捕房訴吳廣德竊盜案（主文）吳廣德竊盜罪處徒刑二月九·滙山捕房訴劉學科學等傷害案（主文劉學）科孫其仁共同傷害各處罰金四十元經强制執行如不完納均一元折算一日易科監禁十·虹口捕房訴邵福貴竊盜案（主文）邵貴福竊盜處拘役四十日十一·虹口捕房訴袁士成竊盜案（主文）袁士成竊盜處有期徒刑八月裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵徒刑一日十二·老閘捕房訴李竇洪鴉片案（主文）李寳洪持有鴉片代用品處罰金一百元經强制執行如不完納以一元折算一日易科監禁紅丸三兩半没收十三·静安寺捕房訴劉卿桂等妨害自由案（主文）劉卿桂宗佩方以强暴脅迫使人行無義務之事各處罰金三十元經强制執行如不完納均以一元折算一日易科監禁十四·匯山捕房訴劉同興妨害自由案（主文）劉同興妨害自由處罰金三十元經强制執行如不完納以一元折算一日易科監禁十五·新閘捕房訴錢永三等竊盜案（主文）錢永三袁兆春共同竊盜各處拘役四十日十六·新閘捕房訴張式玉竊盜案（主文）張式玉竊盜處罰金一百元經强制執行如不完納以二元折算一日易科監禁十七·静安寺捕房訴劉日盛等賭博案（主文）劉日盛蘇景文共同賭博財物一罪各處罰金二十元罰金如易科監禁以一元折算一日現洋一元雙角二枚雙角票二張單角票一張銅元六十二枚骰子三粒磁盃一個均没收十八·老閘捕房訴陳永詐欺案（主文）陳永詐欺罪處拘役四十日裁判確定前覊押日數以二日抵拘役一日十九·總巡捕房訴魏忠竊盜案（主文）魏忠竊盜處拘役二十日廿·静安寺捕房訴張蘭生等賭博案（主文）張蘭生聚衆賭博處有期徒刑二月併科罰金五十元張堂全徐林生趙福卿共同賭博財物各處罰金六十元秦愛卿徐小毛田國雙沈季林劉根卿錢季根王阿福傅杏興姜根鴻趙阿成五昌弟康松桃王四陸明章田兆發共同賭博財物各處罰金四十元經强制執行如不完納均以一元折算一日易科監禁牌九一付摇缸一只骰子六粒大洋二元鈔票一元雙角四十二枚

<h3 id="e1">Distinguishing Right from Wrong <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, due to the vigorous implementation of party governance, the government has imposed strict control over public opinion. The people have had almost no opportunity to supervise or criticize politics. Since the sudden floods of July and August last year, followed by the September 18th and January 28th incidents, internal and external troubles have arisen simultaneously. The nation's situation is precarious, like a pile of eggs. The government, realizing its error in restricting public opinion, has resolutely restored freedom of speech, allowing the people to criticize the merits and demerits of politics. We believe that this awakening on the part of the government is indeed an opportunity for the government to be reborn, and also an opportunity for our country to be reborn. However, what standard should we use to comment on the rights and wrongs of politics today? In other words, what is wrong, and what is right? To comment on right and wrong without a standard or position for judgment will only further obscure the truth, placing the government in a difficult situation where blame is constant and actions are uncertain, making it even more impossible to break through the current predicament. These words are sincere. Therefore, we dare to use a few words to clarify right and wrong.</p>
<p>We believe that to clearly distinguish the "right" and "wrong" of politics, one must base it on facts and stand on the position of the interests of the "majority" of the people. Judgments based on personal feelings are not true right and wrong. Judgments based on the interests of individuals or a small number of people are also not true right and wrong. Moreover, malicious attacks or insults made without basing them on facts are even less true right and wrong.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? Facts are the most powerful rhetoric and the most irrefutable evidence. Only judgments of right and wrong based on facts become a kind of fact, "a kind of irrefutable ironclad proof." With sufficient facts to rely on, and based on the interests of the majority of the people, analyze the nature of the facts. That which aligns with the interests of the majority of the people is "right," and vice versa is "wrong." This kind of judgment is the judgment of the masses, a fair judgment. In other words, it is the true right and wrong. Those who speak with ulterior motives, engage in malicious attacks, or offer irrational scoldings show that they themselves lack a sense of right and wrong. If people who lack a sense of right and wrong comment on the rights and wrongs of politics, they are merely politicians, mobs, or foolish idiots. The people will certainly not be deceived by them, and the government's prestige will not be damaged in the slightest.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the government wants to clearly distinguish the right and wrong of public opinion, it must first recognize whether public opinion is based on facts and whether it stands on the position of the interests of the majority of the people. If the government wants to defend the right or wrong of politics, it must also use these two things as the basis for clear judgment. If the government wants to win the support of the people, it must make a clear declaration on these two things. For example, in disaster relief, in remedying education that is on the verge of bankruptcy, and in stopping the recently proposed increase in postal rates, the government can take the interests of the people as a prerequisite and, with great determination, resolutely inform the whole country with facts. Then the people will certainly exert themselves to praise the government and exert themselves to support the government. Otherwise, right and wrong reside in the hearts of the people and can never be suppressed by authority or clever words.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if the government wants to clearly distinguish the right and wrong of public opinion, it must first have a sense of right and wrong itself. If it lacks a sense of right and wrong and merely takes its own interests as right and wrong, then what public opinion considers right will all be considered wrong by the government. In that case, the government and the people will increasingly deviate from each other. How can it hope to win the praise of the people?</p>
<p>The British political scientist Laski once said: "A government that seeks wide consultation and extensive inquiry benefits more from the criticism of its opponents than from the praise of its supporters. Blocking the criticism of the people is merely planting the seeds of its own destruction." These words contain great truth and are truly famous words. May our government consider them carefully.</p>
<p>Let's take the smallest matter as an example. We have been calling on party and government leaders to unite and overcome the national crisis for half a year now. If the party and government leaders today truly realize that separation is wrong and reunite in good faith to jointly plan to overcome the current national crisis, then it may not be the power of public opinion criticism or the power of true right and wrong supervision. Is true public opinion truly sufficient to prompt the awakening of the leaders? We now ask to take this one matter as a judgment.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Resolution Passed by the League of Nations Special Committee <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Authorizing the Shanghai Mixed Commission</p>
<p>Qualified to Decide on the Restoration of Normal Status</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Should Withdraw into the Concession as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>China Has Accepted Japanese Objections</p>
<p>Reuter, Geneva, 20th - According to a dispatch from Tokyo, Japan will refuse to endorse the resolution of the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations authorizing the Shanghai Mixed Commission to decide the date on which Japanese troops should withdraw into the Public Concession and road-building areas outside the concession. This news has caused quite a stir here. After this news reached Geneva, the President of the League of Nations Assembly, Hymans, immediately consulted with the representatives of China and Japan this morning. The Mixed Commission has not been authorized to decide the date of withdrawal of troops at its sole discretion, but only to express its opinion on the matter. Although the Mixed Commission should make decisions by majority vote, the current resolution requires the Commission to strive for unanimous agreement. The draft resolution, now in response to the request of one of the two parties concerned, authorizes the Mixed Commission to announce the complete withdrawal of troops when the time is right and can be safely implemented, and hopes that any resolution must be unanimously agreed upon. If unanimity cannot be reached, then any majority resolution will be effective, and the President also has the right to vote. The resolution urges the two parties concerned to continue negotiations with the determination to seek a speedy conclusion, and requests the major powers with special interests to continue to mediate. The resolution concludes that if a truce agreement cannot be reached, the entire issue should be referred to the League of Nations Assembly for full consideration.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 20th - The President of the League of Nations Assembly, Hymans, told reporters that this afternoon he had met with the Chinese representative Yan Huiqing and the Japanese representative Nagaoka to discuss the resolution. It is expected that a public meeting of the Committee of Nineteen Nations will be convened tomorrow. It has also been heard that Yan Huiqing has received instructions from the government that China does not oppose the resolution drafted by the Committee of Nineteen Nations.</p>
<p>Reuter, Geneva, 19th - After an hour of discussion today, the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations unanimously passed a resolution to deal with the situation in Shanghai. The resolution will now be distributed by Hymans to the Japanese representative Nagaoka and the Chinese representative Dr. Yan. It is expected that both parties will be able to accept it on behalf of their governments. After that, a public meeting of the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations will be held, and then the League of Nations Assembly will be convened to formally approve the plan. The resolution is about two and a half pages long, but its two main points are: first, to request the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops in the near future; and second, to stipulate that the Shanghai Mixed Commission is qualified to decide when normal status has been restored. If necessary, it can be decided by a majority vote. The resolution reviews the resolutions passed by the League of Nations Assembly on March 3rd and March 11th, and states that the Special Committee of the League of Nations Assembly does not intend to handle the truce negotiations currently being held in Shanghai. If any major difficulties are encountered in the withdrawal of troops, the representative of any major power stationed in Shanghai may notify the Special Committee. The resolution also states that the resolutions of the League of Nations Assembly are in place, and no other conditions can be adopted at present. The resolutions of the League of Nations Assembly cannot be considered to have been complied with until the Japanese troops have been completely withdrawn.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Special Dispatch) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received the full text of the draft resolution of the League of Nations Special Committee on the Sino-Japanese armistice conference. In the afternoon of the 20th, Wang Zhaoming convened Luo Wengan and Jiang Zuobin to discuss the attitude towards the draft resolution. After detailed study, it was decided to instruct Representative Yan to comply. The instructions are currently being drafted and are expected to be issued today or tomorrow. According to diplomatic circles, our country can generally accept the draft resolution, but it is believed that there will be many disputes over the restoration of normal status in the future, because our side believes that the so-called restoration of normal status can only specifically refer to the cessation of military affairs, and absolutely cannot include the boycott movement and other political issues in the discussion.</p>
<p>Reuter, Nanjing, 20th - Although the Central Daily News stated today that the National Government did not want to accept the resolution of the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations in Geneva, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters this evening that the National Government has decided to accept it and has telegraphed Dr. Yan Huiqing to accept it.</p>
<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 20th - According to responsible sources here today, Japan cannot agree to the draft formulated by the Special Committee of Nineteen Nations in Geneva because Japan cannot listen to the Mixed Commission to decide the date of withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai. Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 19th - Before accepting the replies of the Chinese and Japanese governments on the draft resolution drafted by the Committee of Nineteen Nations of the League of Nations Assembly, it was decided at a secret meeting today to ask the Shanghai Neutral Committee to make renewed efforts to bring the two sides closer together. If the situation permits, a report on the restoration of peacetime status should be drafted, and the League of Nations should be notified when it is considered that the deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops can be stipulated. Today, the Chief Chinese Representative Dr. Yan Huiqing told people that China is very willing to negotiate with Japan on the Shanghai incident, but how can negotiations be conducted if one party is sitting on the chest and abdomen of the other? He also said that China is also willing to discuss the Manchuria issue, but how can negotiations be conducted if what Japan claims is given an important position on the agenda, while what China claims is excluded from the agenda? Finally, he said that in his opinion, Japan's threat to withdraw from the League of Nations when implementing Article 15 of the League of Nations Charter is purely air power, a false threat, because withdrawing from the League of Nations will lose the trusteeship rights of the Pacific islands.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - Japanese Representative Nagaoka telegraphed the contents of the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen Nations on the 19th to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, requesting instructions. Foreign Minister Yoshizawa replied with other arguments that it was difficult to approve and decided to announce this intention. Originally, the resolution was arbitrarily decided by the Committee of Nineteen Nations and had nothing to do with Japan, and was absolutely opposed. If the Chinese representatives in Shanghai and the representatives of the four countries rely on the resolution to negotiate a truce, there is no room for compromise. If the resolution cannot be established, the responsibility rests entirely with China and the League of Nations. After consulting with government leaders, Yoshizawa instructed Representative Nagaoka to take a tough stance with President Hymans.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa issued a reply objecting to the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen Nations. The reasons are: (1) Articles 7 and 8 of the resolution misinterpret the resolution of the General Assembly of March 4 as stipulating the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops. The resolution of March 4 only stipulated the first withdrawal. (2) Article 1 recognizes the resolution on local negotiations for a truce, Article 11 grants the Mixed Commission the power to determine the withdrawal of troops again, and Article 13 stipulates that if the truce negotiations fail, they will be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly. All of these are League of Nations interventions in the Shanghai negotiations. (3) Article 11 grants the Mixed Commission the power to declare the timing of the withdrawal of troops, which actually allows other countries to interfere with the actions of the Japanese army, so it is absolutely opposed.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 20th - The Chief Chinese Representative Yan Huiqing visited U.S. Secretary of State Stimson at 10:30 this morning and talked for a long time. It is expected that they exchanged views on the situation in the Far East, but what they discussed was not announced. After Yan left, Stimson also received Mr. Opet, a confidant of French Prime Minister Tardieu, and talked until noon. Then Stimson invited British Foreign Minister Simon to lunch at the hotel.</p>
<p>Reuter, Geneva, 19th - The representatives of the League of Nations, Wellford of New Zealand and Walter of South Africa, met with U.S. Secretary of State Stimson this afternoon to hold informal discussions on the Far East issue. Walter, the representative of South Africa, firmly advocated at the League of Nations Assembly that the League of Nations should use all its methods to stop military aggression. It is said that his meeting with Stimson mostly elaborated on this view. Reuter, London, 20th - The China Association held its annual meeting today. Chairman Myers spoke, strongly advocating cooperation between China and the League of Nations, saying that the League of Nations must participate in resolving international peace in the Far East. This problem is now a scourge of the world. The League of Nations can provide China with manpower and financial resources without wanting to establish foreign control in China, but only to instruct China on how to manage itself. In his opinion, the League of Nations is in the position of a teacher, not a guardian, in other words, it provides new administrative technology and never claims to be a guardian. China can benefit greatly from foreign assistance, and the West can also benefit from China's revitalization, because China is both a producer and a consumer, and if its territory is peaceful, its activities in world trade will definitely increase greatly.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Resolution Adopted by the League of Nations Special Committee <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 20th - The resolution adopted by the Committee of Nineteen yesterday is analyzed as follows: The Special Committee (1) entrusted the powers with special interests in Shanghai to participate in and assist in the establishment of a compromise, so that hostile acts, which had in fact ceased, could be determined to cease, and the withdrawal of Japanese troops could be stipulated, in accordance with the resolutions of March 4 and March 11; (2) Because the Special Committee cannot replace the negotiators at the level of its establishment in the agreement mentioned in the resolutions of March 4 and March 11, this agreement can only be concluded locally, but if difficulties arise during the negotiations or before the implementation of the aforementioned agreement, all the powers participating in the negotiations have the right to report to the Special Committee. This Special Committee exercises its powers in the name of and under the supervision of the League of Nations Assembly; (3) Because the negotiations should be conducted in accordance with the resolutions previously adopted by the League of Nations Assembly, no party may forcibly propose conditions contrary to the aforementioned resolutions; (4) The Special Committee has reviewed the draft armistice terms submitted, which have been recognized by both parties, and recognizes that these terms are in line with the spirit of the aforementioned resolutions, especially the third article of the armistice draft, which is that Japan allows its troops to withdraw to the Public Concession and the road-building area outside the Concession of the Hongkou district, and return to its original position before the January 28 incident; (5) The Special Committee declares that, in accordance with the spirit of the resolutions of March 4 and March 11, this withdrawal of Japanese troops should be carried out in the shortest possible time; (6) The Special Committee declares that the resolution of March 4 can only be considered fully implemented when the Japanese troops have been completely withdrawn; (7) The Shanghai armistice draft plans to establish a mixed committee composed of twelve members to be responsible for verifying the mutual withdrawal of troops by both parties and assisting in returning the areas withdrawn by Japanese troops to the Chinese police.

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Aircraft Crashes in Yangjiazhai, Pudong <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>▲ One pilot dead, one seriously injured.</p>
<p>Engine removed, fuselage destroyed by fire.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 10:40 AM, three Japanese reconnaissance planes practiced flying over Donggou near Pudong. Aircraft No. 65 crashed due to fuselage damage, resulting in one pilot being seriously injured and one dying on the spot. Several days ago, a Japanese aircraft crashed near Hujiang University in Yangshupu, with the pilot escaping by parachute. Not even a week has passed, and another Japanese aircraft has crashed. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Accident: At 10:20 AM yesterday, three Japanese reconnaissance planes, each equipped with handheld machine guns, took off from the Japanese military airfield at the Gonda Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. They were flying over the sky between Donggou and Qingning Temple when Aircraft No. 65, piloted by Sergeant Nomura with Lieutenant Fukui as co-pilot, suddenly experienced damage. The fuselage spun in the air, and a distress signal was sent to the Japanese No. 15 warship anchored outside Xigoukou to prepare a rescue parachute. The aircraft crashed from west to east, tilting and falling onto vacant land near a small riverbank in Yangjiazhai, about one li east of Donggou.</p>
<p>▲ Warship Rescue: The two reconnaissance planes flying in the air, in addition to sending the alarm, protected Aircraft No. 65 on both sides. After it landed, they flew to the Japanese warship to report. They then circled the crash site in the sky near Yangjiazhai, firing machine guns as a show of force. Upon receiving the alert, the destroyer used a small steamer to rescue Lieutenant Fukui from the Huangpu River, but he had already succumbed to his injuries and died. At the same time, a small steamer carrying naval landing forces was dispatched to the crash site for rescue.</p>
<p>▲ Precinct Assistance: At 10:40 AM yesterday, the 5th Precinct of the 3rd District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with residents of Donggou, suddenly heard a loud noise and saw a Japanese aircraft crash. Chief Wang Chongshan personally led Inspector Chuan Xinyu and police officers, along with Supervisor Liao Chengzhang, to the crash site to investigate. They found the pilot in the aircraft covered in blood. They tried to rescue him. Due to the language barrier, Nomura wrote, "Lieutenant Fukui has fallen into the river. I am Sergeant Noei, please notify Yufeng Mill." He also requested instructions from District Chief Zhang of the 3rd District Police Station and reported to headquarters.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Troops Land: Japanese Consul Mura also notified the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telephone, intending to send Japanese troops to land and carry out the rescue themselves. Intelligence Division Chief Zhang Sixu verbally refused, stating that the Public Security Bureau could handle the removal of the aircraft and that there was no need to dispatch Japanese troops to avoid misunderstandings. However, Japanese naval landing forces, armed, had already landed at the Donggou pier and headed for the rescue. Army Military Police Captain Inagaki Hiroki and Japanese Vice-Consul Shirai Yasushi also led the military police on fire boat No. 445 to provide assistance.</p>
<p>▲ Aftermath: After the Japanese naval landing forces and military police landed, they stood guard with weapons on both sides of the pier. In addition to rescuing the injured pilot for medical treatment, the 5th Precinct of the 3rd District temporarily erected two small wooden bridges on the small river to facilitate pedestrians. Later, the Japanese military dismantled the engine of the aircraft themselves and hired over 30 Chinese laborers to transport it to the pier and load it onto a barge for return. The rest of the aircraft wings, etc., were burned at 3:20 PM, sending up a cloud of black smoke, which did not subside until 4:10 PM. During the burning, Japanese soldiers stood guard with guns all around. Afterward, Chinese laborers moved the burned remains of the wings, etc., to the pier and loaded them onto cargo ship No. 445 for return. This was completed by 5:00 PM. At the same time, the Japanese marine corps and military police also withdrew.</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Investigation: Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Yingxing, in addition to reporting verbally to Mayor Wu, also sent Supervisor Mai Shaofu to the crash site in Donggou to investigate the truth with District Chief Zhang of the 3rd District Police Station in order to report.</p>
<p>▲ Report Process: Wang Chongshan, chief of the 5th Precinct of the 3rd District, reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating that at 10:40 AM on April 20, Japanese aircraft No. 65 took off from the airfield of the Gonda Cotton Mill in Puxi and flew over the Huangpu River outside Donggou. Unexpectedly, the fuselage was damaged, and the pilot urgently sent a distress signal to notify warship No. 15, which was anchored outside Xigoukou. The aircraft then crashed about one li east of Donggou, near Yangjiazhai. When the aircraft crashed, the chief immediately led his subordinates to the scene to take care of the situation. At the time, the public flocked to watch, surrounding the area. Japanese aircraft circled the sky over Donggou, firing blank guns as a show of force. At that time, Supervisor Liao Chengzhang happened to be at the station investigating a case and immediately assisted in the handling. He reported to the district chief for instructions and received a telegram from the district chief stating that he had received a telegram from the bureau chief instructing the precinct to notify the nearby Japanese troops while sending police to assist in moving the damaged aircraft back to the airfield. The chief knew after receiving the instructions that the naval landing forces had arrived earlier to rescue without being notified by the precinct. At the same time, Army Military Police Captain Inagaki Hiroki and Japanese Vice-Consul, among others, came to the station one after another to thank them for their vigilance. The chief, after consulting with Japanese Vice-Consul Shirai Yasushi, sent all Japanese army and navy troops who arrived one after another back to avoid misunderstandings with the public. The army and navy have now withdrawn. Currently, the Japanese aircraft team is dismantling the aircraft. The fuselage, which is damaged and unusable, has been burned on the spot under the supervision of the vice-consul. The aircraft parts that can be used will still be transported back to the airfield for repair. The area is quiet and peaceful.</p>

<p>Japanese Army Ministry Issues Statement</p>
<p>Russian Newspapers Criticize White Russian Provocations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry issued a statement to the press this afternoon, saying that there can be no peace in the Far East without friendly relations between Russia and Japan. It denied various rumors that Japan was carrying out armed coercion in Manchuria and that Japan was inciting White Russians in the area, saying that it was a big mistake to falsely accuse the Japanese army of colluding with the White Russians. The Japanese army has never used the White Russians or provided them with assistance. Japanese military authorities are now making every effort to restore peace and order in Manchuria and Mongolia, and have absolutely no intention of infringing upon Soviet Russian rights or territory. Finally, it was said that after a thorough investigation of the case of the bombing of the Japanese military vehicle at the beginning of this month, it seems that it has been discovered that the Communist Party was involved in the matter. The Army Ministry seems deeply concerned about the current situation in Manchuria and the northern part of the region, as the anti-Manchukuo army has begun large-scale operations, aiming to undermine the ability of the Manchukuo to maintain peace and order, especially when the League of Nations Investigation Team arrives in Manchuria, it plans to carry out large-scale activities. It is heard that the anti-Manchukuo army is now spreading rumors to shake the hearts of the Manchukuo army, such as the forced withdrawal of the Domon Division from Changchun. The Army Ministry received information that the Manchukuo army has no fighting spirit, and those north of the Chinese Eastern Railway are now retreating south from Fangzheng, and are not resisting the enemy's offensive at all. The Manchukuo army in the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is now also retreating west towards Yimianpo, and the situation in Jiandao is becoming more and more serious. Wang Delin's army is now advancing south from Shalandian (transliteration). (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, Russian newspapers, based on reports from the Soviet Russian consul in Suifenhe, criticized the White Russians in northern Manchuria for posing as members of the Soviet Russian secret service and creating ill will between Japan and Russia, saying that according to a telegram from Boli, it was learned that the White Russians had impersonated representatives of Chita, representatives of the Third International, and representatives of the National Secret Service. (19th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) For several days, Russian newspapers have said that war in the Far East is about to break out, but today the situation seems to be slightly milder. The arrest of Russian employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway by the Japanese authorities is of course widely resented, but there has been no major accusation against Japan other than that. (19th Reuters Dispatch) (Tokyo) Japanese newspapers reported a conversation between Minister of the Army Araki and newspaper reporters, saying that if the situation in the three eastern provinces becomes more serious, Japan may have to continue to send reinforcements to the area. Although Araki did not explicitly state what he meant by the situation, it is presumed that he was referring to the Volunteer Army, and not to Japanese-Russian relations, because Hirose, the commander of the Japanese army stationed in Harbin to replace the Domon Division, recently refuted the claim that Japanese-Russian relations were tense.

<h3 id="e28">Zeng Zhongming Discusses Parallel Lines of the South Manchuria Railway <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Railway official Zeng Zhongming discussed the issue of parallel lines of the South Manchuria Railway, saying that what Japanese newspapers refer to as being parallel to the South Manchuria Railway are the Datong branch road, the Shenhai Road, the Meimei branch road, the Jihai Road, and the Kaifeng long-distance railway automobile. However, the Datong branch road is 90 miles away from the South Manchuria Railway, and the Shenhai and Jihai roads are 60 miles away from the South Manchuria Railway. According to the common practice in countries around the world, if the distance between the two lines is more than 35 miles, even if they are parallel, they cannot be called competing lines. Therefore, the Datong, Shenhai, and Jihai lines cannot be unilaterally called parallel lines or South Manchuria's competing lines by the Japanese side under any circumstances. The Mexi branch line is intended to transport coal, and the Kaifeng line is a long-distance railway automobile with a very narrow track, which should be discussed separately. What Japanese newspapers are promoting, in addition to the parallel lines of the South Manchuria Railway, also includes a South Manchuria encirclement line. All railways in the Northeast that raise funds on their own are listed within the encirclement line. This is nothing more than an attempt to call all self-built railways in Northeast China competing lines for the interests of the South Manchuria Railway. The Japanese protest against the parallel lines began for the first time in the 33rd year of Guangxu when the Qing Ministry of Posts and Communications planned to repair the Xinfa branch road. At that time, the two ministries of Posts and Communications and Foreign Affairs refuted it with reason. The most recent formal proposal of the parallel line issue by Japan was in January of the 20th year. Kimura, the director of the South Manchuria Railway, proposed to the Northeast authorities the issue of consultation under the order of the Japanese government and the South Manchuria Railway Company. Later, the Japanese side delayed the negotiations, and the consultation was therefore suspended. Therefore, the issue of parallel lines has not been formally discussed. The Japanese side claims that the parallel lines are a violation of the treaty on our side. The basis for this claim is that during the Sino-Japanese plenary conference in the 31st year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, when the Treaty was concluded on the Eastern Three Provinces, the Japanese side made a request in the supplementary agreement of the conference, and the Chinese plenipotentiary declared that no parallel trunk lines and branch lines that would damage the interests of the road would be built near the South Manchuria Road. This is recorded in the conference minutes and is said to have the effect of a treaty. In fact, the main treaty and supplementary agreement of the case do not cite any explicit provisions prohibiting the construction of parallel lines and lines that compete for interests. The conference record was not formally signed and has no basis for a treaty, so it has no effect as a treaty. Moreover, the word "nearby" should have a normal limit, how can a road more than 100 kilometers away be called a parallel line? Even Japanese scholars think it is a distortion. According to Professor Kiro Mota of the Imperial University of Japan, in a lecture on the Manchurian Incident, "Japan claims that China's construction of the Datong Line is a violation of the treaty because it is parallel to the South Manchuria Railway, but in reality, the Manchuria Railway Line and the Datong Line are 100 miles apart and are not parallel. If the Datong Line and the Manchuria Railway are parallel, it is no different from saying that the Japanese Tokaido Line and the Central Line are parallel," which can be used as clear evidence that the Datong and Jihai lines are not parallel to the South Manchuria Railway.

He took advantage of his free time to come to Nanjing to handle embassy affairs. All parties are discussing the Shanghai conference issue, and it is hoped that it will reopen soon. At this time, he is unwilling to make any statements, but hopes that China and Japan will continue to proceed in the spirit of maintaining peace, and the future can be optimistic. Johnson also said that the American citizen Lu Ji, who was kidnapped by bandits in the city in January, has not yet been rescued. He came here to ask Foreign Minister Luo to find a way to rescue him. (20th Special Dispatch) (Nanjing) American Ambassador Johnson is scheduled to go to Shanghai on the 21st. It is said that he has no important tasks in coming to Nanjing this time, and there is no contact regarding the Shanghai affairs. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic circles are informed that the resumption of the Shanghai ceasefire conference will have to wait until the League of Nations Special Committee approves the plan before it can be determined. As for restoring normalcy and then withdrawing troops, it is very difficult to explain. Currently, the Japanese side intends to include boycotting Japanese goods and other political issues, which is too far from the original mission of the ceasefire conference, indicating that the Japanese side has no sincerity in accepting the League of Nations resolution.

<p>New American Proposal Postponed for Discussion</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 20th: The General Committee of the International Disarmament Conference held a meeting at 10:00 a.m. today to discuss the resolution on disarmament standards (i.e., progressive reduction) drafted by the special drafting committee last night. Soviet Russian People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov first gave a speech, stating that Russia could not accept this resolution. However, the assembly eventually adopted it, with only the Russian representative casting an opposing vote. Subsequently, Chairman Henderson proposed the US plan to calculate the required troops based on the absolute need to maintain domestic order and the relative need for national defense. US Representative Gibson immediately requested that the discussion be postponed and considered after a detailed plan was sent.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 19th: A few minutes before the end of today's General Committee meeting of the Disarmament Conference, the issue of the United States' participation in the activities of the League of Nations, which had not been discussed for a long time, was brought up again. French Representative Boncour, when describing the difficulties of disarmament in his speech, stated that it was because certain major powers were not members of the League of Nations. He also said that "we are willing to find ways to allow non-member states to maintain their detached status." After Boncour finished his speech and returned to his seat, Stimson had a confidential talk with him for some time before leaving the meeting place at 12:45. However, when Boncour mentioned the number of non-member states in his speech, his gaze was directed towards Stimson, but Stimson quickly looked down at the newspaper on the table to avoid it.</p>

<p>Heavy Taxes Levied on Foreign Tea Imports</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, London, 19th: Today, the British Parliament convened a meeting, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer presented this year's budget, which included an import tax of four pence per pound for foreign tea and two pence per pound for tea produced in the Empire. It is expected that Chinese tea exports to Britain will suffer another blow tonight.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, London, 19th: Today, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer made a most important statement in the budget presented to Parliament, that the United Kingdom may not immediately return to the gold standard. However, Chancellor Chamberlain stated that, after carefully weighing the advantages and disadvantages, he concluded that, if the United Kingdom wanted to avoid dangerous fluctuations in the value of the pound, it was necessary to create a suitable gold reserve, and it was especially important to create a sufficient gold reserve for foreign exchange. Therefore, he intends to close the old exchange accounts and open new accounts for its assets, called exchange balance accounts. He plans to ask Parliament to authorize the government to borrow 150 million pounds to consolidate the strength of the new accounts.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 20th: After the British budget was released, opinions were divided. Those who hoped for preferential treatment and those who paid income tax were angry at this budget. However, the steel industry was comforted that it could soon be rescued. Liberal Party public opinion considered this budget to be natural, but Lloyd George pointed out that this was the most unsatisfactory budget in recent years. What everyone hopes is that the second budget may be better, because Chamberlain stated that a second budget would be necessary after the Lausanne reparations conference and the Ottawa Imperial Economic Conference. The Labour Party is currently noncommittal and will hold a Labour Party meeting tomorrow. It is said that they cannot agree with the tea tax.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Washington, 19th: The passage of the budget by the British Parliament has now caused a sharp reaction in the United States. Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a speech in the Senate today, pointing out that the budget passed by the British indicated that Britain was no longer prepared to repay war debts. His intention was obviously to cancel war debts. If the policies of European governments remain unchanged for a long time, economic recovery is unlikely, whether war debts are cancelled or not. Borah continued to say that although the war debts owed by European countries were borrowed by the US government, it must also be known that the debts borrowed by the US government came from private fundraising at home. Interest on private debts cannot be reduced, and the principal must be repaid in the end. Outsiders think that once war debts are cancelled, everything will be fine, but they do not understand the actual situation.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Sweden's Match Monopoly Fails to Compete with Soviet Russia <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Kruger's Fraud Discovered During His Lifetime</p>
<p>Three Types of Company Stock Become Worthless Paper</p>
<p>Rumors in Swedish Newspapers that Kruger is Not Dead</p>
<p>Paris Police Chief Firmly Denies</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Swedish Capital, 19th: Several incidents of fraud by Match King Kruger during his lifetime have recently been discovered. More important ones include the fact that the 45 million kronor of deposits listed in the Kruger &amp; Toll Company's assets in a certain bank in Danzig have been found to be non-existent. Also, the Netherlands Scandinavian Trading Bank listed in its lending reconciliation table has never done banking business, and there is not even an office. It is just an empty bank. Currently, among the stocks issued by Kruger &amp; Toll Company, three types of stocks—Kruger &amp; Toll stock worth 5 million pounds, Swedish Match Company stock worth 24 million pounds, and International Match Trust stock worth 21 million pounds—have all become worthless paper as a result of fraud and losses. As for the background of Kruger's unprecedented fraud, it is only being revealed for the first time today. It is said that Kruger's competition with the Soviet Russian Match Company actually consumed huge sums of money secretly. His acquisition of match monopolies in various countries was often entirely due to bribery, and the value of his dumping of matches was far below cost. If this statement is true, then Kruger's match monopoly war can be called a failure at the hands of Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 20th: Swedish newspapers reported that Match King Kruger's suicide was a pretense and that he is still alive and hiding in remote villages in Sumatra. Today, the Paris Police Chief has firmly denied this, saying that the suicide was indeed Kruger and that it was proven beyond doubt at the time. The Swedish Legation here also issued a statement refuting the rumor, saying that the rumor originated because someone bought a large batch of cigarettes from a company in the Swedish capital and transported them to Sumatra. The cigarettes happened to be the brand that Kruger used to smoke, so the rumor that Kruger was not dead arose. Guomin News Agency, New York, 19th: The International Match Company, a subsidiary of the Kruger &amp; Toll Match Company, has filed for bankruptcy today and appointed Alvin Trust Company to handle the liquidation.</p>
<p>Reuters, Swedish Capital, 20th: The police today arrested another person related to the Kruger Company's false accounting case. His name has not been released, but it is said that he is an auditor of the Kruger &amp; Toll Company. According to the case found, a total of four people have been detained, including the three remaining members of the company's board. Reuters, Swedish Capital, 20th: The detainee today was accountant Walter, who was elected by the Kruger &amp; Toll Company's shareholders as the company's auditor in 1930 with two others.</p>

<p>Guomin News Agency, Washington, 19th: The US Navy budget was submitted to the House of Representatives today. Its total amount is 326.34 million US dollars. The Navy Committee stated that it did not want to reduce it further, otherwise it was feared that exercises would have to be reduced and warships in service would also have to be cut, which would be dangerous for national defense. Rear Admiral Beratto, commander-in-chief of naval exercises, also said that he did not agree with further reductions in the navy. Therefore, although the Navy Committee is fulfilling the government's reduction policy, it does not insist on reducing the navy. It only hopes that the international situation will improve, then reductions may be possible.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Warsaw, 19th – Polish political circles are placing great importance on General Bi Su Zi Qi’s meeting with key Romanian military and political figures in the Romanian capital. Bi Su Zi Qi returned to the country from Egypt where he was escaping the winter cold, and arrived in the Romanian capital last week. Initially, he only planned a brief stay of a few days, but it is now rumored that he will stay for two weeks. It is said that Bi Su Zi Qi, dissatisfied with France’s Danube Federation plan, intends to organize a new group of Eastern European countries, with Poland, Romania, and Yugoslavia as its core.

<h3 id="e73">Ma Zhanshan and Hei Yuan’s Escape Account <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Consorting with Prostitutes and Drinking with the Japanese Before the Escape</p>
<p>Escaping Under the Cover of Night</p>
<p>Sending a Telegram to Hei Yuan En Route to Spread Confusion</p>
<p>Ma Claims His Reputation Is Secondary to His Conscience</p>
<p>Black Dragon River Communication – Ma Zhanshan returned from Hailun to Jiang Yan on March 23rd, but ultimately succumbed to the coercion of the Japanese. On April 1st, while the Japanese were in high spirits and not anticipating any changes, he suddenly led a battalion of guards and set off at night, leaving Bokhara. Ma’s departure was like a caged ape escaping its enclosure, a trapped bird leaving its cage, causing those who were reveling in the joys of spring to suddenly feel as if they had been doused with cold water, overwhelmed by a sense of disappointment that their good fortune was marred. Initially, Ma adopted a policy of compromise with the Japanese, with the condition that before the overall situation in the Northeast was concretely resolved, all political arrangements in Jiang Province after cooperation with the Japanese would remain under Ma’s full authority to facilitate the transition. Although the Japanese dispatched three advisors, they were intended to serve only in an advisory capacity. However, after the Japanese had lured Ma into their trap, believing that they had already conquered the three northeastern provinces, they began to apply the same methods used in Korea to the Northeast. In terms of military affairs, they sought to eliminate the strength of Ma’s troops. In terms of transportation, they forcibly extended loans and occupied railways, effectively seizing the arteries of the Northeast. In terms of industry, they used the guise of joint ventures to exploit forests and mines, aiming to completely plunder the resources of northern Manchuria. In terms of education, they deleted and revised textbooks, intending to eliminate the national identity of the people of the Eastern Provinces. They also sought to establish concessions to serve as settlement areas for immigrants, and promoted the widespread cultivation of opium, attempting to corrupt the character of the Chinese people. There was no end to their various acts of aggression. At the same time, they also brought in pro-Japanese elements to occupy key positions, to facilitate manipulation. The Provincial Bank and the Department of Finance, which were critical to the lifeline of the entire province, were both under the control of pro-Japanese individuals, causing Ma’s every move to be constrained. Moreover, Japanese advisors, or even junior warrant officers, would arbitrarily visit the Military and Provincial Headquarters and demand that Ma meet them. Every time he met with someone, they insisted on taking a photograph with Ma, causing constant disruptions. It was impossible to refuse. The Japanese clearly regarded Ma as a defeated person under their protection. Under these circumstances, Ma felt deeply distressed and decided to stage a resolute revolt, but he did not reveal his intentions on the surface. Three days before Ma left the provincial capital, he even went to the Japanese-run Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway) office in Jiang, where he consorted with prostitutes, gambled, and partied late into the night without returning to his residence. He stayed at the office for three consecutive days, as if he were a hero with no place to use his talents, destined to end his days with wine and women. The Japanese did not suspect him at all. Until one day at three o’clock in the morning, when the officers of the Military and Provincial Headquarters were still sound asleep, it was suddenly announced that the hand-picked troops were to gather in the backyard of the Military Headquarters, pack their gear, and depart immediately. At the same time, all military vehicles were commandeered, loaded with various important items, and at 3:35 AM, under the cover of a dark night with only a few stars still visible, they headed directly for the North Gate, forced it open, and left. By the time the Japanese became aware of what was happening, Ma’s troops had already reached Taian Town. Three days later, a telegram arrived from Baiquan saying that Ma was personally inspecting the stationed troops and disbursing military pay nearby, and that he would return to the province within two days. All military and civil affairs would be temporarily handled by Chief of Staff Zhang Wenzhu and Secretary-General Dong Jiwu respectively. The order in the provincial capital would be maintained by Cheng Zhiyuan, Commander of the First Cavalry Brigade. On the fifth day, another telegram arrived from Nehe, saying that he would soon travel from Bai to Hai, inspecting the garrisons along the Hu-Hai line.</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>Continued Important News</p>
<p>On the way back, he would also detour to Harbin to meet with Director Zhang (Jinghui) on important public affairs, estimating that he would return to the province within three to five days. Then, on the seventh day, another telegram arrived from Heihe, stating that he had gone directly to Heihe, suffering from a sudden cold along the way, and needed to rest. He would return to the province after the ice thawed in the spring. Looking at the above three telegrams, Ma’s return date was constantly being pushed further and further away. In fact, after Ma arrived at Taian Town, he stayed for one night and then went directly to Keshan. He never went to Baiquan or transferred through Hai and Ha. The telegrams sent from various places were all sent by people who had been dispatched in advance, following his instructions and sending them on time. It was to prevent the Japanese from pursuing them from behind, and he had to create a false impression to avoid danger and ensure thoroughness. When Ma arrived at Keshan, he summoned the battalion commanders and gave a speech, roughly saying: “I could not bear to be a slave of a conquered nation, so I devised a plan to escape the clutches of the Japanese and reunite with my brothers who have shared my hardships. My previous armistice and peace talks with the Japanese were merely an expedient measure to adapt to the circumstances. Moreover, considering that the rural economy of Jiang Province has always lacked flexibility, one day without work means one day of hardship. If military affairs disrupt the people’s lives, and if this year’s spring plowing is hopeless, then the majority of the province’s population will face starvation without the enemy’s oppression. Therefore, I endured humiliation and tried to maintain the situation for a time. However, the Japanese are narrow-minded and malicious, and they treat us as if we are nothing. All their actions are aimed at putting us to death. At this critical juncture of life and death, we must make a painful decision, unite as one, and fight to the end, sticking to our original intentions. Moreover, in a world of power politics, justice and righteousness are ignored, and only iron and blood can defend ourselves. Relying solely on appeals is not a way to survive. Furthermore, as soldiers, our duty is to serve the country with our lives. If there is a glimmer of hope, we should muster our courage and make the ultimate sacrifice for the country. Being an official or a bureaucrat is merely a temporary career choice. The preservation of the nation is the ultimate destination of our bones. Sometimes, being an official or a bureaucrat is not an option, but our own bones cannot be sold. But there are self-proclaimed clever fools like so-and-so who, in the face of this great disaster, still attempt to take advantage of the situation for their own benefit. This is not only selling their own bones but also auctioning off the remains of their ancestors in the graves. As for my personal reputation, I have no time to worry about it, and I don’t need to worry about it. My lifelong moral view can be summed up in two sentences: 'Entrust life to creation, and let conscience guide reputation.' Ma Zhanshan, who fought at Jiangqiao in the past, was like this, and Ma Zhanshan, who retreated to Heihe today, is still like this. And even Ma Zhanshan, after his liver and brain have been splattered on the ground, will be no different. This heart of mine is only for my brothers who have shared life and death, and I do not wish to speak to those who are fond of fault-finding.” Since retreating to Heihe, Ma has concentrated the troops along the Hu-Hai and Qi-Ke lines in the Nehe and Nenjiang area, preparing to act when the time is right. He also plans to meet with the League of Nations investigation team at a certain location after they arrive in the East to express his true attitude and to tell the team about all the ways the Japanese have been scheming to destroy us in recent months. As for the province’s response to Ma’s escape, Zhao Zhongren and Han Yunjie jointly sent a telegram to Changchun on the third day, reporting that Ma had left his post and would not return. At the same time, Zhao also telegraphed Su Bingwen, asking him to come to the province to take charge of everything. Su replied by telegram that his talents and strength were meager and he was not up to the task. Judging by his attitude, he seemed to be assessing the situation and waiting for changes, not willing to reveal anything easily. On the seventh day, Changchun announced that Cheng Zhiyuan would act as the Garrison Commander and Zhao Zhongren would act as the Provincial Governor, but Ma’s position was not officially removed, intending to temporize for the time being. It is said that Puyi has sent his confidant Xie to Heihe to persuade Ma, advising him not to take an extreme stance and that all issues can be discussed at length to achieve a win-win situation. Some say that Puyi himself is not free, so how can he have the energy to care about Ma, and he also knows that it is difficult to expect a tiger to willingly lower its head and re-enter the trap. His constant chatter is simply because he is a lonely man, doing his best. In addition, Zhao Zhongren, seeing that the situation was rapidly deteriorating, thought it was a good opportunity to fish in troubled waters and satisfy his desire for leadership and control, which he had longed for for twenty years. On the morning of the ninth, he boarded a special train prepared by the Qiqihar-Ang’angxi Railway and transferred to the East China Railway to go to Changchun to lobby the Japanese to officially appoint him as the Provincial Governor. As he was about to leave, someone asked him about the situation, and he replied that even if Ma did not return, there would be no more military action. When asked what he based this on, he said that the situation dictated it. Whether his words are reliable remains to be seen. The people of the country can only wait and see what happens next.</p>
<h3 id="e74">League of Nations Investigation Team’s Trip Out of Customs <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Advocate Separate Land and Sea Routes</p>
<p>Numerous Representatives Received on the 15th and 16th</p>
<p>Beijing Communication – The League of Nations Investigation Team’s work after arriving in Beijing was most intense on the 15th and 16th. On the 15th, from 10:00 AM onwards, they received a constant stream of guests and held a half-hour closed-door meeting with the Japanese representative Yoshida, which concerned the team’s trip out of Customs. At the request of the Chinese representative, they discussed security guarantees with the Japanese side. At 4:00 PM in the afternoon, they went to the Shuncheng Wangfu (Prince Shuncheng’s Residence) for another meeting, the content of which was not announced. However, it was learned that the team began its work on March 14th in Shanghai, the day after its arrival. In Shanghai, they investigated the Battle of Zhabei in great detail. In Beijing, they had four extensive discussions with the central authorities on the validity of the Sino-Japanese Treaty of 1915 and the Sino-Japanese Conference Records of 1905. Our side placed great emphasis on political relations, while the team focused on legal issues. The team returned to Beijing from Wuhan on the seventh of this month and visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where Foreign Minister Luo showed them the original text of the 1905 records to refute the Japanese rumors that China had lost the original. At that time, the Japanese representative Yoshida was not present, so when Lytton and others held a meeting of the investigation team in Beijing the day after their arrival, they told Yoshida what Luo had shown them. Yoshida made some explanations, which is the origin of the rumor circulating outside that there was a debate over parallel lines at the meeting. In fact, this kind of political event had already been discussed by the central authorities and was beyond the authority of local officials, so it was never discussed with the governor of the Eastern Provinces. The investigation team itself only held the meeting to inform Yoshida, who had not been contacted beforehand, and Yoshida only spoke vaguely about the legal validity of his visa, without any major dispute. The scope of the continuous meetings at the Shuncheng Wangfu, although broad, was all local in nature, such as the Fengpiao (Fengtian currency) issue, the three hundred pending cases between China and Japan, and various diplomatic and military issues before and after the September 18th Incident. All of these were unrelated to the authority of the central government and the validity of treaties. It is said that Zhang Xueliang’s answers were quite frank and straightforward, giving Lytton and others a good impression.</p>
<p>On the 15th, the representatives received by the investigation team included Lu Guangxu, Su Shangda, Jin Enqi, Wang Huayi, and Zhao Yushi, representatives of various legal groups and civilians from the Northeast. They consulted about the situation of the September 18th Incident. In addition to giving detailed reports, the representatives officially denied the current illegal organizations in the Northeast on behalf of the people of the Northeast, and the suffering of the people of the Northeast under the iron hooves of the Japanese after the incident. Representative Wang Huayi spoke, translated by Chen Liting. Wang described the situation of the Japanese in the Northeast. The most noteworthy point was that the Japanese buried thirty Chinese students alive in Tongliao and Jinjiatun. Lytton asked how they were buried. Wang and others replied that the land was dug into a large pit, and the Japanese forced the students into it and covered them with soil, causing them to suffocate to death. The team was speechless upon hearing this. Next, they explained the Japanese destruction of education in the Northeast, revision of textbooks, addition of Japanese language, confiscation of school institutions, and even private schools were confiscated. After a long conversation, they left after presenting several memorandums bearing the names of more than twenty organizations in the Northeast, along with much reliable evidence. From 10:45 AM to 11:15 AM, they received representatives of various cultural institutions and academic groups in Beijing: Ding Wenjiang, Fu Sinian, and Xu Shuxi. The representatives all spoke about the Northeast issue. Xu Shuxi was the most knowledgeable about the Northeast issue. After the conversation, he personally gave Lytton his various writings on Northeast railway treaties for the team to refer to. From 11:15 AM to 12:30 PM, they received representatives of university professors in Beijing: Qiu Changwei, Ning Encheng, Zhang Jiasen, Liu Baizhao, and Wang Baotang. Their conversation was as follows: (Representative asked) Before the report is completed, Japan has a plan to increase its troops in the Northeast by 75,000. Will the investigation team take measures to prevent this? (McCoy replied) China should appeal to the League of Nations for Japan’s use of force in the Northeast. Whether Japan sends 80,000 or 100,000 troops, the acquisition of force will eventually be resolved by the League of Nations, so there is no need to worry. The current Japanese military plans have been reported to the League of Nations by the Chinese representative in Geneva. (Representative asked) China is in a transitional period. The purpose of your investigation is to collect facts, but the facts must be observed through the communication of all things. (Lytton replied) We are very willing to accept any material that can be observed in this way. There are also experts on the team who are ready for consultation. (Representative asked) The Northeast issue arises because of the strength of one and the weakness of the other. Although China has no real strength, it would rather fight Japan than surrender to Japanese force. This issue is not only a source of disaster for the East but also an obstacle to the world. (Lytton replied) The team is well aware of the importance of this matter. Representative Liu Baizhao, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of Northeastern University, was present in Shenyang when the incident first occurred, and addressed the investigation team, saying, “When your team investigates the Sino-Japanese dispute, you should pay attention to the facts and historical background. Japan’s desire to occupy Manchuria is its traditional policy for fifty years. When I stayed in London, British Prime Minister MacDonald asked me to write an article on Eastern politics, and I responded with an article on Sino-Japanese relations and world peace, which was published in the June 1921 issue of the Social Newspaper editorial. What I said that day has now become a reality. Unfortunately, China’s military preparations are still inadequate, while Japan is a world power that rampantly invades with force. At that time, I was in Shenyang, and a month before, I learned that this was about to happen. Up until 2:00 PM on September 18, I telegraphed Wu Jiaxiang, Secretary-General of the Border Defense, asking if he was prepared to deal with it. Unexpectedly, at 10:30 that night, the Japanese army bombarded the Beida Camp with artillery. For about three hours, the authorities telegraphed Northeastern University, instructing them to remain calm and not to clash with the Japanese. The next day, the school’s transportation was completely cut off by the Japanese army, which eventually led to the inability to continue classes. Now that Japan is strong and China is weak, if the League of Nations can resolve this dispute with an impartial attitude, then peace in the Far East and the world can be preserved.” Lytton paid close attention to what Liu said and asked Liu to provide the team with a detailed written account. From 12:30 PM to 1:30 PM, they received representatives of the press in Beijing and Tianjin: Chen Bosheng, Luo Longji, Pan Zhonglu, Sa Kongliao, Yin Shuxian, Sun Ruiqin, Hu Zhengzhi, and others. The representatives first stated that various parties have already discussed the political issues surrounding the Eastern Provinces issue with the investigation team. Now, they would like to present it from the perspective of public opinion. Sir Lytton then asked about the situation of newspapers in the Northeast before September 18. After the representatives replied, they explained that although the names of the original newspapers in the Northeast still existed after the incident, they were actually forcibly controlled by the Japanese. All opinions and records had long lost their freedom. Newspapers from Beijing and Tianjin that arrived in the Northeast were also detained. The people of the Eastern Provinces do not even have the freedom to read Chinese newspapers, so the depth of their suffering cannot be imagined. The representatives then presented many photographs of the atrocities of the Japanese army during the Tianjin Incident, explaining each one in detail before leaving. At 4:00 PM, the team went to the Shuncheng Wangfu to hold its fourth meeting with Director Zhang, who listened to the opinions of the Northeast side, as the collection of materials had been completed. The meeting lasted until around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The 16th was the date originally scheduled for the investigation team to leave Customs. However, due to the incident of the Northeastern traitors refusing Gu Weijun and the Japanese side’s failure to provide a responsible assurance of security, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent instructions to Yoshida, only allowing him to be responsible for protection within the possible scope (i.e., within the South Manchuria Railway line), which was vague and empty. Therefore, the team postponed its departure and telegraphed the League of Nations for instructions. However, the team held meetings every morning at 9:00 AM, during which Lytton informed the Chinese or Japanese representatives to attend the meeting separately before the meeting, indicating that the investigation team was still working hard to study the issue of security for leaving Customs, and not just waiting for a reply from the League of Nations before making a final decision. Japan hoped that the investigation team would travel to the Northeast via Dalian and the South Manchuria Railway. After the investigation team arrived in Shanghai, they made this proposal to the investigation team. Later, because various parties expressed their disapproval, the Japanese side temporarily remained silent. Recently, the issue of the puppet state’s refusal of Gu was resolved only after Lytton made a firm statement that “If Gu cannot go, the entire investigation team will not go.” However, the Japanese government brought up the old topic again, asking Lytton and his party to enter Liaoning via the South Manchuria Railway, claiming that they could not guarantee security if they took the Shanhaiguan route, which was a far-fetched reason. It is not difficult to imagine what their true intentions were. In addition, at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 16th, the team held another meeting, and the Japanese representative still insisted that they should change to the sea route from Tanggu to Dalian and take the South Manchuria Railway line to Shenyang, where they could be responsible for protection. Otherwise, if they took the Beining Railway directly to Shenyang, it would be difficult to be responsible for the safety along the way. The members of the investigation team felt that the sea route would be inconvenient for the investigation and that it would be better to take the Beining Railway, but they did not make a concrete decision. After 5:00 PM, the team held another meeting at the hotel, attended by all the members and the Chinese and Japanese representatives, to continue discussing the issue of security and routes for leaving Customs. The Japanese representative Yoshida suddenly proposed a new plan, advocating: (1) A part of the investigation committee would be accompanied by the Japanese representative on a special train of the Beining Railway, passing through Shanhaiguan, Jinzhou, to Shenyang. (2)</p>
<p>The Chinese representative Gu Weijun would accompany a part of the committee on a ship from Tanggu to Dalian, taking the South Manchuria Railway line, and meet with the committee traveling by train in Shenyang, and then begin investigating the situation along the South Manchuria Railway line. In this way, the Japanese side could guarantee their safety. It is said that the investigation team is inclined to accept this plan and has sought Gu Weijun’s opinion. If Gu agrees, then they will set off. Gu believes that this matter is of great importance and has telegraphed the central government for instructions, so the date of leaving Customs depends on the reply from Nanjing and their attitude towards this proposal. On the 16th, the team continued to receive representatives. At 10:30 AM, they first received Zhang Zuoxiang, the former Chairman of Jilin, and Wan Fulin, the former Chairman of Heilongjiang, to discuss the situation in the two provinces in detail. This was because the meeting at the Shuncheng Wangfu with Zhang Zuoxiang and others discussed the most important issues in the Northeast, leaving no time for this. The conversation lasted for over an hour, and Zhang and Wan left. It is said that Lytton paid close attention to the fact that Ma Zhanshan had revolted this time, and Wan Fulin also gave a detailed explanation of this. From 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM, they received representatives of Northeastern University professors Ning Encheng, Zhao Minggao, Yang Zhiqi, Zhao Hongzhu, Cao Guoqing, and others. The representatives all spoke about the September 18th Incident and the damage suffered by Northeastern University. Ning Encheng also personally gave Lytton his book “A Study of the Evolution of the Northeast,” as well as the books “The Northeast Treaty Issue,” “The Northeast Railway Issue,” and “The Northeast Situation” for reference. During the conversation, Guan Guangyu, a representative of the refugees from the Northeast, also arrived to explain the various atrocities committed by the Japanese army in the Northeast after the September 18th Incident. Finally, he handed over a memorandum to the team, with the following main points: (1) The Manchurian people have not carried out any self-determination movement. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, all ethnic groups have enjoyed equal rights. The only way to seek equality and freedom for the Manchus is to support the Republic of China. (2) In fact, there is no special Manchurian ethnic group in the Northeast seeking self-determination. Most of the people in the Northeast are immigrants from Hebei and Shandong. The language and customs of the Manchus are no different from those of the Han people. (3) The people of the Northeast cannot exercise self-determination. The puppet state is manipulated by Japanese advisors, and the people have no say. (4) We oppose the Japanese abducting Puyi from Tianjin and oppose his serving as the puppet head of state. (5) The so-called mass movement in favor of organizing a puppet state is incited by the Japanese. (6) The puppet government is entirely created by the Japanese. (7) The people of Manchuria oppose puppet independence. The rise of the Volunteer Army is a manifestation of the people’s true will. At 12:30 PM, they received Nagatsu, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, and Takeuchi, the representative of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin. At 12:45 PM, Lytton and five other members went to Gu Weijun’s residence in Tieshizi Hutong for lunch and returned to the Beijing Hotel at 3:00 PM. The American and German representatives had originally planned to visit Guhe Temple, but they temporarily canceled their plans due to yin and yang. After 4:00 PM, the Italian representative and others went out to purchase local products and returned at 6:00 PM. Also, the telegram sent by Ma Zhanshan to the head of the League of Nations investigation team had totaled 2,500 characters as of the 16th, and the rest may arrive on the 17th or 18th. It is currently being translated into French by Wu Xiufeng and handed over to Sir Lytton. (July 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Two Routes of Gan Bandits Disturb Fujian <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>One Heads to Northern Fujian, One Heads to Southern Fujian</p>
<p>Zhang Zhen’s Division Retreats from Nan’an Without Fighting</p>
<p>Fujian Provincial Government Urgently Requests Guangdong to Send Reinforcements</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication – The Red Bandits in various counties of southern Jiangxi are disturbing western Fujian. It has been found that they are the fake 4th, 8th, 11th, 12th, and 4th Armies, numbering about 40,000 people. Taking advantage of the fact that the Guangdong army has not yet arrived in Fujian, they are wreaking havoc, one group leaving Tingzhou through Longyan, plotting to attack Nan’an and Zhangping to disturb southern Fujian, and another group leaving Tingzhou through Liancheng, plotting to attack Yong’an and Qingliu to disturb northern Fujian. In northern Fujian, the newly formed Second Division under Lu Xingbang, in cooperation with the Sixth Independent Brigade under Zhou Zhiqun, is currently holding the line of Yong’an, Qingliu, and Ninghua to block their advance. In southern Fujian, after Yang Fengnian’s brigade of Zhang Zhen’s division withdrew from the counties of Longyan, they were originally holding the strategic location at the junction of Longyan and Yongding. Now, due to the fierce attacks by the Red Bandits, they have shortened their defensive line and abandoned the strategic location again, retreating to the Shuichi area at the junction of Longyan and Nan’an. Zhang telegraphed the province yesterday, claiming that this was a plan to lure the enemy in deep, but Nan’an is only fifty li away from Zhangzhou, and they can arrive in the morning and afternoon. The people are very agitated because the troops on the front lines are retreating without fighting one after another. Zhang, in addition to ordering Yang Fengnian’s brigade to strictly defend Nan’an and not retreat any further, has also transferred Wang Chengyun’s brigade to reinforce Zhangping to prevent the Red Bandits from attacking Zhangzhou from the side. The provincial government ordered Chen Guohui’s First Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army stationed in Quanzhou to quickly send a detachment to reinforce them, as a large number of troops from Zhangzhou had been transferred to the front lines, and the rear was inevitably empty. It also telegraphed the Guangdong side, urging Huang Renhuan’s division to quickly depart from Wuping and Shanghang so that they could cooperate with Zhang’s division in Zhangping and Nan’an to attack the Gan bandits, first recover Longyan, and then advance on Changting. At the same time, it also sent provincial party committee member Kang Shaozhou (a native of Changting) to Guangdong to report to Chen Jitang on the bandit situation in western Fujian and to discuss fundamental solutions.

<p>Japanese Plane Flies Low to Reconnoiter Songjiang Communications, 19th of this month) This morning at 9:40 AM, a Japanese plane came and flew very low, circling over the city for three weeks, lasting about twenty minutes, before heading east along the railway.</p>
<p>Cheng Jun Tragically Killed by Bandits, Songjiang Communications, Cheng Jun, the former head of the Public Security Bureau of this county and a native of Fengjing, resigned and lived at home, not interfering in external affairs. On the 22nd of last month, he led his family and nephew, transporting trunks of clothing and other items to Dingjiazhai in Zhejiang Province, when they encountered seven or eight bandit boats with dozens of bandits. They were intercepted and robbed of all their foreign currency and jewelry. The bandits also obtained documents such as the commission symbol of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Knowing that they were bandit suppression personnel, they let the others go, but fearing future troubles, a bandit leader ordered Cheng Jun to be bound and executed. The rest of his family members were spared and returned to Fengjing by boat. The incident was reported, and the newly appointed Su-Song Bandit Suppression Commander Shen Baoyi, First District Water Police Chief Xu Pucheng, and others believed that the bandits in that area were gathering and rampant and should be suppressed immediately. On the 12th, they personally led the Second Team led by Captain Li and Squad Leader Chen to search by address, meeting at Wujiazhao, four or five li away from Fanbang, and engaging in a fierce battle. After more than an hour, the bandits were unable to withstand the attack and scattered. Five hostages kidnapped from Huzhou, two bandit boats, and five bandits, along with rifles and clothing, were seized and taken back to the Jinze Water Police Headquarters. Upon interrogation, it was learned that one of the captured bandits was the bandit leader Wang Yuting, who confessed the details of Cheng Jun's murder. He stated that after Cheng Jun was kidnapped, he was taken to the Duzi Temple in Liuhe, where he was interrogated in the hall. Cheng Jun knelt on the ground, and despite all kinds of threats and being severely wounded, he refused to write a letter to his family to ask for ransom. It was discovered that Cheng Jun had secretly recorded the bandits' roster and weapons locations in a diary for future bandit suppression efforts. The diary was found by the bandits, and when asked what it was for, Cheng Jun, knowing that he could not escape, pointed and scolded them, saying, "I was born as a bandit suppression officer, and I regret that during this national crisis, I cannot suppress the enemies to pacify the region. Unfortunately, I was captured by you. Death is death, and there is nothing more to say." Hearing this, the bandits were furious and tied up Cheng Jun, tied large stones to his feet, and threw him into the river, firing eight shots, killing him. Commander Shen, based on the confession, had Cheng Jun's body exhumed from the address and transported back to his home for burial. Bandit leader Wang Yuting was taken to Songjiang by Public Security Bureau Inspector Yang Shijie and is being interrogated at the Public Security Bureau.</p>

<h3 id="e77">All Sectors Enthusiastically Implement National Crisis Savings <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the National Crisis Savings, all sectors have risen to the occasion upon hearing the news and are quite enthusiastic, demonstrating their patriotic zeal. Everyone shares the same sentiment. The following is a record of the actions taken yesterday:</p>
<p>Zhang Yichen's Determination, Zhang Yichen, a standing committee member of the Citizens' United Association, said to the New Voice News reporter yesterday, "Since the government moved to Luoyang and announced long-term resistance, our colleagues had already discussed National Crisis Savings. Therefore, since April 1st, after enduring the pain of opening the market, the proposal for commission-based savings was submitted to the Joint Federation of Commerce and other joint meetings and was approved. Most businesses agreed to implement it. However, to ensure practical implementation, it is especially important to lead by example. Therefore, as a first step to promote this, I am willing to contribute a certain percentage of my business income as savings. I hope that all citizens of Shanghai will rise up together and make a determination to save the country."</p>
<p>Oriental Steel Window Company, This company is located on Nanjing Road and was founded by a Ningbo merchant named Shao. In view of the Japanese military's aggression, they had an early determination to save the country. They have implemented a plan to contribute 2% of their business income as savings. It is reported that since its establishment, they have accumulated approximately 500 taels of gold, which they plan to deposit in the National Crisis Savings Bank.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road Businessmen's Association, The national crisis is urgent, and national salvation savings cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, key officials of the association have been making contacts to discuss savings methods and are making every effort to advocate for it. They will convene a general meeting in the near future to discuss the matter in detail.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Hongkou District Under Violence Appeals for Protection to Reopen for Business <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Also Requests Exemption from Municipal General Tax in the District Asks Chinese Directors and Taxpayers' Association to Make a Proposal</p>
<p>Since the various industries in this city painfully reopened for business, only the shops in the Hongkou District, being under violence, have not dared to resume business rashly before obtaining adequate protection. The Citizens' United Association of the district yesterday sent letters to the Chinese Directors and Commissioners of the Municipal Council and the Taxpayers' Association, appealing for negotiations regarding the protection of business resumption and the exemption from the municipal general tax. The original letters are recorded as follows: Letter to the Chinese Directors and Commissioners: "The Japanese army has invaded and occupied Shanghai, damaging our Min-Hua market. The concession area of Hongkou has allowed the use of artillery ships as a war preparation camp. During the two months since the start of the war, the citizens here have been in deep distress. Even after a month since the ceasefire, the citizens are still aware of the violence. Although we want to resist for a long time and reopen for business painfully, we dare not reopen rashly without adequate protection. Alas, the once prosperous market of Hongkou District has now become a desolate world. The circumstances are different and the situation is unique. If we do not provide swift relief to maintain the difficult situation, I fear that dangerous situations will arise. It is not something the concession authorities should stand by and ignore. The sub-associations of this district, entrusted by the merchants and residents of this area, are collective organizations and have considerable responsibilities. The matter concerns our vital interests, and we cannot bear to sit idly by. I dare to ask you to lead the way and live up to the expectations of the public. We must seek to achieve security in the Hongkou area and strive for the welfare of the Chinese citizens to seek liberation. At the meeting, we must wage a full-fledged verbal battle or submit written proposals to fully assert the claims of our Chinese citizens. (1) Maintain the safety of the market and demonstrate the united reopening of business, so that the market has the hope of recovery. (2) Relieve the market, turn over the finances, and exempt the municipal general tax as much as possible. Announce the fact of the exemption to avoid accidents. How about reducing or exempting land tax? It should be determined according to the market situation. The above two points are matters that need to be implemented urgently at present and cannot be delayed. We hope that you will strive fully for the painful and difficult situation of the Chinese citizens. We are bound together and must negotiate and fight to implement them. There is no need for further words. As for the concession authorities' strained budget, it is reasonable to hold the violent Japanese accountable and ask them for compensation so that the budget is not lost and there is no need to sacrifice one thing for another. Therefore, exempting the Municipal Council's general tax is a fair and just reason. We deeply hope that you will work hard to propose and achieve results. We are urgently awaiting your reply." Letter to the Taxpayers' Association: "We have repeatedly heard about your protests regarding the postponement of the municipal general tax collection, which shows that your association is leading the masses and making fair proposals in a timely and appropriate manner. We admire your sincerity and perseverance. At a time when the business situation is bleak, with few customers coming to the door, the financial situation is declining and unimaginable, and a terrifying and dangerous situation is chilling, if we want to survive this difficult situation, we should exempt the municipal general tax to provide relief so that the market has hope of recovery. This time, the safety zone in the concession has been closed for two months, while the Hongkou District has been closed for almost three months. The pain of all the damages is indescribable. Being under the violence of a harsh environment, the concession should provide protection. Without adequate protection, how dare we trade and open for business? This is something that should be paid more attention to. In summary, the situation is becoming urgent. The concession authorities can understand the market situation and should automatically take measures to show fairness. We have always admired your association as a collective organization of Chinese taxpayers in the city and should jointly protest seriously with the Chinese Directors and Commissioners to make a powerful representation to achieve the goal and comfort the Chinese citizens' hopes, without causing accidents. This is what we urgently hope and await your reply."</p>

<p>Will be Officially Announced After Determination</p>
<p>The Public Concession's northern and eastern districts taxpayers of Chinese ethnicity who have been directly impacted by the recent situation are currently being given serious consideration by the Municipal Council regarding the issue of partial tax reduction and exemption. Several suggestions were made at yesterday's board meeting, mostly stating that the partial reduction and exemption method will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Once it is determined, it will be formally announced. However, the collection of taxes in the central and western districts is still proceeding as usual. This is because the Municipal Council, in order to carry out various administrative tasks, must have funds for application. This must be specially stated to avoid misunderstandings.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Shanghai Education Community National Salvation United Association Circular to All Schools <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Tragedy of National Subjugation... is Right Before Our Eyes</p>
<p>Although It Is Not Seen in Color, It Is Like Saying It With Tears The Shanghai Education Community National Salvation United Association, seeing that school teachers and staff seem not to be very enthusiastic about national salvation work since the end of the Shanghai war, has sent an extremely painful and earnest letter to all schools in Shanghai, and also a letter to the principals of each school, asking them to forward it to the teachers and staff, and also asking each principal to convene a discussion meeting at their school to discuss implementation methods. The original text of the two letters is recorded as follows: Letter to all teachers and staff of Shanghai schools.</p>
<p>To All Teachers and Staff of Shanghai Schools: Since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang last year and the Shanghai War that occurred this time, during the past six months, all of you have been heartbroken by the shrinking territory and foreign aggression, and have been unable to suppress your depression and grief. Moreover, as teachers and guardians, you are with innocent, pure, and lovely young people and children every day, but the country is broken and the tragedy of national subjugation is right before our eyes. Thinking of the legacy of our ancestors and the future destruction of our descendants, how can we bear it? I, in my humble opinion, believe that there are only two paths for us Chinese people to take today: one is to maintain an active and fighting spirit, survive with the determination to die, and defend ourselves with independent strength; the other is to be pessimistic and passive, lose all hope, and surrender to others to be slaughtered, quietly waiting for the final judgment of justice. If our minds and bodies are not particularly abnormal, who can stand outside the general principle of maintaining survival and choose the road to death without regret? During the Shanghai incident, heroic soldiers defended the country, bleeding and fighting on the battlefield, and innocent residents lost their homes and children in the war zone. Having encountered unprecedented disasters, it is easy to arouse human sympathy. For a time, they united with the masses, running and shouting in all directions, engaging in relief, rescue, and consolation. I know that there must be many people in our Shanghai education community, and the hard work and diligence of all of you can be imagined. However, now that the war has stopped and the sound of cannons has gradually faded, and most schools have opened, the spirit of running around to save the country has become slightly silent. The association has repeatedly received letters from various parties talking about this matter, all saying that the recent Shanghai education community is not very enthusiastic about national salvation work. After reading them, I am filled with shame and gratitude. I think that our education community colleagues take guiding young people and cultivating children as their goal, and their relationship with the survival of the nation and the prosperity of the country is extremely important. Moreover, the knowledge of our general citizens is naive and needs to be carried out through social education. This is also an urgent matter, and this position cannot be taken by others. These are all clear facts at present. Alas, our education community colleagues, in this political and social environment, if we exhaust our efforts, how much of the country's danger can we save? It is really difficult to determine. However, because of this, we must do our best to show some of the nation's immortal spirit in order to continue and develop the nation's life. We should also convey this precious spirit to the younger generation to fight for this final success or failure. Now that the war has stopped and the sound of cannons has faded, the Wusong and Zhabei areas are scorched earth, and the blood of the compatriots who were brutally killed is still there. The counties of Baoshan, Jiading, and Taicang are now under the iron hooves of the enemy, houses are occupied and destroyed, property is looted, women are raped, and good people are killed. How can we, the Shanghai education community, forget this and ignore it? In order to seek peace of mind, we should first try to do our duty. How to discuss the method of saving the country so that it is effective, how to undertake the work of saving the country so that it is practical, how colleagues should unite, how students should be guided, how spare time and energy should be used, I sincerely hope that you will, in addition to the implementation decided by individuals or school groups, try to show this association as a model and pass it on to others for reference. It is a great blessing. I am writing urgently and have a lot to say. Letter to all principals of Shanghai schools. Respectfully.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, Now that the Shanghai war has stopped, Zhabei and Wusong have become scorched earth, and the blood of our compatriots is sprinkled on the ground. Heaven, what have we done to deserve this? The three counties of Jiading, Baoshan, and Taicang have fallen into foreign lands. Looking north at Changshan and Heilongjiang, the map will change color again. Reading Mr. Du Fu's poem "The country is broken, but the mountains and rivers remain; spring in the city, grass and trees grow lushly," I really don't know where to shed tears. Looking back, I don't know if our colleagues in the Shanghai education community can continue to step up their national salvation work. This association has repeatedly received letters from various parties, all saying that the atmosphere in the Shanghai education community is bleak. After reading them, I was very ashamed and wrote a letter to all the gentlemen of the teaching staff of each school. Although I did not see it in person, it is like saying it with tears. I believe that you gentlemen have a deep love for the country and will not dismiss it as rash. Accordingly, I have attached [blank] copies and respectfully ask your principal to take the trouble to distribute them and invite the teachers and staff of each school to hold a discussion meeting in order to jointly plan a good way to save the country and fulfill the national duty. The danger of the country is getting worse, and the expectations of society are high. Our colleagues in the education community seem unable to do otherwise than resolutely shoulder this part of the great responsibility.</p>

<p>The First Regiment of the Independent Brigade of the 88th Division is stationed in a certain place with excellent military discipline. All supplies are purchased with money from the local maintenance association in that area. They do not conscript laborers or seal boats. They hold roll call every night and conduct briefings every morning. Battalion commanders and regimental commanders conduct secret inspections from time to time. One day, two soldiers were arrested at a certain Yanzikou (place name) and were severely punished with a hundred military sticks on the spot. Soldiers from a certain team occasionally used waterwheels as firewood. The villagers complained to the maintenance association, who informed the regimental commander. The regimental commander investigated and found it to be true, and ordered them to pay thirteen yuan and severely punished the soldiers with a hundred military sticks. Soldiers from a certain team occasionally took a few plants of rapeseed from the fields. The team leader found out and severely reprimanded the soldiers on the spot without any leniency. The regimental officers often interact with local people, soliciting opinions with an open mind, which is most commendable. The villagers appreciate them and often give them snacks, which they refuse repeatedly before accepting. Their regimental commander, Zhao Junmai, is from Hunan. The first battalion commander, Liang Sizhong, is said to be the son of Liang Qichao. Both are American-educated students, and their knowledge and morality are exemplary for soldiers. There is a county-run elementary school in the area. Regimental Commander Zhao ordered the stationed troops to give up classrooms and repeatedly urged the school principal to find a way to open the school. It is especially commendable that soldiers can value elementary school education.</p>

<p>Japanese Warning to the Municipal Government is Inaccurate</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reported that it was rumored that the Japanese Consul had verbally warned the Shanghai Municipal Government regarding the labor strike at the First and Second Factories of the Japan-China Textile Co., Ltd., a Japanese-owned company located in the corner of Lujiazui, Pudong. The Municipal Government then instructed the Public Security Bureau to send police to protect them. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to the Municipal Government again to inquire about the truth. According to the Secretary-General, it was completely inaccurate. Since January 28th, the Japanese Consul-General Murai has not been to the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Zhu Qinglan's Final Plea for Help for Flood Victims <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Qinglan's Message to Fellow Citizens: Qinglan was ordered to take charge of the flood relief task force, and it has been eight months. Based on the investigations and relief experience accumulated over these eight months, I deeply know that the disaster area is vast and the relief funds are meager. Using the relief funds raised to save the flood victims is not just a drop in the bucket, but like a grain of millet in the vast sea. Therefore, the urgent relief distribution is considered insufficient everywhere. The labor relief distribution only covers the main dikes of the Jianghuai Yunhan, while the branch dikes and people's dikes still have no solutions in many places. The agricultural relief distribution is less than one in a hundred. The total relief supplies, in addition to more than 7 million donations from home and abroad (reported by the financial team of this association), rely solely on borrowing 450,000 tons of American wheat. However, because the transportation costs are huge, even though we tried to compensate by raising customs and railway surcharges, the income is extremely low due to the national crisis. Therefore, the transportation end has been unable to cope. As of today, we have really reached the end of our rope. However, thinking of the disaster victims, during the flood, charitable organizations in various places and local authorities all raced to rescue them. They have initially survived. Subsequently, the relief funds, relief flour, relief clothing, and relief wheat of this association have been connected in succession, and they can still extend their lives to spring. However, after spring, the voluntary relief has come to an end, and the official relief lacks sources. The surviving people are facing desperation again. The accumulated water has only receded after winter, and the time to plant wheat has already been missed. Later, although we persuaded the people in the disaster area to widely plant rapeseed to help with the spring famine, and we also purchased and distributed seeds, according to the report of inspector Li Hengzhang, the rapeseed failed to germinate due to the prolonged spring drought, and there is no hope for harvesting. Even in higher places where the water receded earlier, due to the lack of wheat seeds, not much was planted, and it will not be harvested until June. Those who plant rice will not be able to harvest until September or October. In these months, what will the hungry eat? How will the diligent cultivate? Every time I think about it, I feel like I am sitting on pins and needles. Indeed, according to the report of the Hubei Post-Disaster Relief Association, more than 200,000 disaster victims in Hengdian, Caidian, Shizui, Qingshan, and other places cannot continue to receive relief. Nearly 100,000 disaster victims and their families in various labor relief areas have no means of living after the work is completed. According to the Buddhist Association, more than 20,000 people are dying in the four counties of Zao, Xiang, Tang, and Xin, with more than 30 people dying every day. Mr. Luo Yunqiao of the Wuhan Daily reported that tens of thousands of disaster victims have no way to survive and have joined the Red Army, causing disturbances everywhere. Also, according to the report from Commissioner Yang Zigong of Henan, after the floods and bandit disasters in the Yanan area, the food is completely exhausted, and the old, weak, women, and children are wandering everywhere. Also, according to the telegram from Supervisor Liu Zhenhua, the wealthy families in Deng County, Tanghe, Biyang, and Nanzhao counties have become beggars, and starving people are everywhere. Also, according to the telegram from the relief branches in Hao County, Yingshang, Guoyang, Fuyang, and other counties in northern Anhui, the grass roots and snails have been eaten up, and dozens of people are dying of starvation every day. It is also said that these kinds of miscellaneous items are eaten without salt, causing many people to die of edema. In addition, there are various texts and telegrams about selling children for food and other tragedies filling the case every day. Every time I look at them, my heart is like a knife. However, because the relief source has been cut off, there is no magic to turn stones into gold. Although I use euphemistic words to shirk responsibility, my conscience is guilty and the pain is worse than the death penalty. I see wealthy people in commercial ports, with tall buildings, fine food, silk clothes, and comfortable cars, enjoying themselves to the full, not to mention them. I also think of areas that have not been hit by disasters, who can still wear simple clothes and eat simple food, cultivating the land and working hard, and living their lives. But these tens of millions of disaster-stricken compatriots have no food, no housing, and cannot cultivate. If they are not starving to death, they will join the Red Bandits. If this continues, the old and weak will become ghosts, and the young and strong will become bandits. How can those who sit and own wealth not enjoy it safely, and those who work hard will probably have no way to live in peace? At that time, will the concessions really be a permanently safe paradise? Therefore, I venture to express my sincerity to all my compatriots who are still able to support themselves. Please have great compassion and provide extensive relief. We must take to heart that every time a disaster victim dies, we are all responsible for a part of the crime. The rich should contribute one or two percent of their wealth, and ordinary people should share the surplus of their clothing and food, or organize groups in each disaster area to go and rescue themselves, or hand them over to this association for distribution and relief according to the tragic situation. The general period of practical benefits can reach the disaster victims, so as to live up to the good intentions of all of you. I hope you will take pity on this tragic cry and give your best wishes to help reverse the catastrophe and widely cultivate blessings. No more to say. Zhu Qinglan kowtows. (Communication address: Disaster Area Task Force, National Government Relief Flood Relief Committee, No. 1 Bingzi, Jiujiang Road, Shanghai)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Fire in the French Concession P] A fire broke out yesterday morning at 8:45 AM in the attic of the Zhen Tai cigarette and paper shop, located at numbers 52 to 54 on Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. Flames burst through the roof and spread to the neighboring Xiang Tai Japanese iron shop at number 48 and the Shunchang Ming Western clothing store at number 50, destroying a total of four storefronts. The fire department dispatched vehicles to the scene and extinguished the fire completely by about 10:00 AM. <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>A fire also broke out at approximately 2:15 PM yesterday at the Xin Da Hardware Store, located at number 293 on Bair Road. A discarded cigarette butt ignited bedding, causing a fire that lit up the sky. The fire department arrived and quickly extinguished the blaze, but one storefront was destroyed, and a significant amount of hardware goods were damaged, with losses estimated at over two to three thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Unemployed vagrants are actively operating on Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, ganging up to wait and rob opium, and nearly stealing gold and silver jewelry. Recently, unemployed vagrants like He Longbin have been gathering around the Zhengjia Wooden Bridge area, located at the intersection of the British and French concessions. They lie in wait, and when they see someone carrying a paper package from the French Concession into the British Concession, they stop them and search for opium. If they find it, they snatch it and run. The victims of these robberies know that carrying opium is illegal, so they dare not report it, making it impossible for the police to investigate.</p>
<p>At 8:40 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, Sun Zhenyuan, a native of Changzhou and an employee of the Juxing Silver Shop at number 264 on the French Concession's main road, was carrying a package of gold and silver jewelry worth $2,020 to the Dafengheng Silver Shop on the British Concession's main road. He hired a rickshaw, and when they passed Zhengjia Wooden Bridge, they were stopped by a group of people who suspected he was carrying opium and tried to rob him. Fortunately, Sun was alert and jumped off the rickshaw, fleeing into the Yongchun Longan shop at number 306 on nearby Fujian Road. The group did not give up and chased after him, where they were spotted by Chinese police officer number 2637, who arrested He Longbin on the spot and took him to the Laozha Police Station for detention.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated the facts and said that three accomplices were still at large, requesting an extension. Sun Zhenyuan also reported the details of the robbery and identified the defendant in court as the one who grabbed his arm. When questioned, the defendant admitted that he and other small-time crooks were specializing in searching for and seizing opium in that area. However, he claimed that after searching the plaintiff, they found no opium and released him. Court President Qian Hongye verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for a further seven days of questioning.</p>
<p>A clandestine morphine production operation was uncovered. Detectives from the Xiahui Road Police Station, having discovered a clandestine morphine production operation at number 31 in Fengbo Alley on Wusongjiang Road, immediately went to the location and arrested Lu Chengxiang. They confiscated manufacturing equipment and morphine, sending him to the Second Special District Court. Because the police investigation was not yet complete, they requested a postponement. After questioning by Judge Li Changnian, Lu was released on bail pending further investigation. These details have already been reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Li continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen described the police's investigation. Lu Chengxiang stated that the house at number 31 Fengbo Alley was rented by a businessman and that he was a sub-landlord. He lived upstairs and rented the remaining space downstairs to Xu Xiansheng. The businessman, who owned the Xiangfengshun Rice Shop, left early and returned late, and he was unaware that Xu was producing morphine in the house. He claimed to have a legitimate business and would not engage in illegal activities, and that the businessman was innocent. He said he had sent people out to find Xu, and that the rent for the house was 45 yuan per month, which could be verified by the rental agreement.</p>
<p>At this point, the judge asked the investigating officer where the manufacturing equipment was found, where the defendant was apprehended, and where Lu lived. Deputy Detective Zou Yunsheng reported that the equipment was found in a side room downstairs, and the defendant was arrested in the rear room upstairs. The police lawyer added that when the police went to search the premises, only the defendant was present, so they immediately arrested him. Zhao Chuanding, the lawyer hired by the defendant, requested an extension to allow the defendant to find Xu and bring him to court. The court ordered a postponement for further hearing, and the defendant remained on the original bail. The police lawyer requested that the confiscated equipment be confiscated immediately to avoid the inconvenience of transporting it to court again for the next hearing. The judge ordered the confiscated morphine manufacturing equipment to be sent to the stolen goods warehouse.</p>
<p>The French Concession strictly prohibits opium and street prostitution. Since the new Chief Inspector of the French Concession took office in Shanghai, he has been cracking down on street prostitution, opium dens (eating opium), morphine injections, red pills, and illegal opium sales. Starting last week and continuing through last night, each police station dispatched numerous detectives to Ningbo Road, Minti Ni Yin Road, East and West Zilaihuo Street, East and West Xinqiao Street, and other areas, arresting over a hundred street prostitutes. More than ten private opium vendors, such as Zheng Xieji, Zheng Yuanfa, and Huachang, had their shops raided. Several detectives who failed to conduct thorough searches have been investigated and dismissed by the Chief Inspector. Currently, special agents from the political department are being dispatched with Western detectives to investigate opium sales.</p>
<p>A robbery on Bair Road led to the immediate capture of robbers. At 7:10 PM yesterday, four robbers suddenly entered the Jiatai South Goods store at number 71 on Bair Road in the French Concession, pretending to shop. They pulled out pistols, threatened the staff into silence, and stole about one hundred dollars in silver and banknotes from the counter before fleeing. Fortunately, a clerk named Jia was alert and secretly followed the robbers. On the way, he encountered Inspector Jin Jiulin and his team of detectives, including Xu Guilin, patrolling the area. He joined forces with Chinese police officer number 377 to apprehend the robbers, resulting in the capture of two robbers and the recovery of some of the stolen goods. The robbers were immediately taken to the police station for detention, pending transfer to the court for further investigation.</p>
<p>A large number of suspected thieves have been released; twenty-one people have been released. The New Gate Police Station recently apprehended fifty-nine suspects in a series of robbery cases. The First Special District Court reviewed the cases and released ten people who were found to have no connection. The remaining suspects were detained pending further investigation, as previously reported. Yesterday was the date for the continued hearing of the case. The New Gate Police Station transported the detained suspects to the court in a large prison van, with tight security. The investigating officers summoned the victims to court, and over a dozen defense lawyers, including Fan Gang, E Sen, Sun Yuan, Jiang Yiping, and Bao Tuo Huang, also arrived. Judge Feng Shide and the prosecutor took their seats and continued the examination of each case. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang briefly presented the details of each case, and the judge questioned the defendants about the facts of the accusations. The defense lawyers then presented their arguments. As a result of the hearing, Judge Feng determined that Pan Guoliang, Xu Changgui, Li Buwen, Deng Changlong, Li Jinfang, Xi Litang, Cheng Fusheng, Chen Dejin, Chen Qiyou, Pan Huanzhang, Xu Jiahe, Wu A'er, Xu Weixin, Xu Yulin, Xu Guangquan, Zhou Fengxiu, Wang A'mao, Yao Jinfu, Yan Wenbiao, Li Maotang, and Chen Dexing, a total of twenty-one men and women, were innocent and ordered their release. The remaining twenty were remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>
<p>The Yage Club resumes its activities. Due to martial law, the Yage Club was unable to hold meetings, and its activities were temporarily suspended. After discussions among the executive staff yesterday, it was decided to resume activities immediately.</p>
<p>Film inspections to be held in Shanghai in April and May. Two committee members will depart from Beijing today for Shanghai. The Shanghai Film Industry Association, due to transportation difficulties between Beijing and Shanghai, requested the Joint Film Inspection Committee of the Ministry of Interior and Education to consider the difficulties of businesses and send members to Shanghai to inspect new films. After consultation, the Ministry of Interior and Education decided to each send a member, along with a supervisor from the Central Propaganda Department, for a total of three people. These three people will be sent to Shanghai each month in April and May to conduct inspections, with each inspection lasting approximately five days, until transportation between Beijing and Shanghai is restored. It is also reported that the three members of the New Film Inspection Committee will depart for Shanghai this Thursday (the 21st).</p>
<p>Two films will be released.</p>
<h3 id="e89">The "Beast of Paradise" <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The "Beast of Paradise," a complete sound and cutting-edge thrilling blockbuster, will be released at the Paris Grand Theater starting today. The content not only uses lions, tigers, and other ferocious beasts eating people as a gimmick, but also the tightness of the plot and the rigor of the layout, although it is as long as 18,000 feet, are shown in one go. The most amazing thing is the monster played by the old man Boris Karloff, whose shape is three parts human and seven parts beast. Mr. Bao's monster in "Frankenstein" has been praised by the audience. Now in this film, it is even more outstanding, which can make the audience speechless. As for the wonderful performances of other protagonists, they are beyond words. Since the pre-announcement was published by the theater two days ago, those who went to reserve seats were overcrowded. Therefore, viewers who do not reserve seats one day in advance will inevitably miss out.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Fallen Clouds and Solitary Duck <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The movie "Fallen Clouds and Solitary Duck," adapted by Star Film Company based on the novel by Mr. Zhang Henshui, was filmed on location in Pingqiu last autumn. Director Cheng Bu has rushed to produce interior scenes, and it has been fully completed recently. It will be released simultaneously at the Central Grand Theater on Sixth Avenue and the Star Theater on Qingdao Road starting on the 23rd of this month. The protagonists of the film are Hu Die, Xia Peizhen, and Gong Jianong. The plot writes about pure love, which is not threatened by power or tempted by profit, and is truly unique. In recent times, the way of couples has been bitter, and love has gone bankrupt. If things are not going well, they will divorce at every turn. I know that the release of this film may be able to slightly save the situation. It is heard that when this film is released, a newsreel of Mrs. Xiao Te coming to Shanghai will also be shown.</p>
<p>A Newly Established Phonograph and Wireless Electric Company.</p>
<p>The Yongsheng Company, opposite the Xianshi Company on Nanjing Road, has newly imported wireless electric machines, gramophones, celebrity records, and ancient and modern musical instruments from overseas. All are novel, unique, exquisite, and unparalleled. Before the official opening, the door was already like a market. It is heard that the owner of the company is a well-known figure in the art world, not one who is diligently pursuing profit. Therefore, both new and old customers are flocking to it, and it will be officially opened on the 23rd with price reductions to attract customers.</p>
<p>Weather Report: The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Shandong coast is sunny with northerly winds, the Yangtze River basin is cloudy with unstable winds and occasional fog, the coastal area south of the Ma'an Islands and the Taiwan Strait is cloudy with easterly winds and occasional showers. There is a cyclone in the north today. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in Shanghai was a maximum of 70.9 degrees and a minimum of 52.5 degrees. On the same day last year, the maximum was 59.4 degrees and the minimum was 50.4 degrees.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor: Sir, I was surprised to read in your newspaper today, in the "Local News" section, the article "Labor Dispute at the Puxi Rihua Factory; Party and Government Agencies Suspend Union Activities." The fact is that our union has never convened a general meeting during martial law, nor has it made any decisions regarding resumption of work. Our union has no preconceived notions about the factory's resumption of production and has not prevented workers or foremen from returning to work. The factory's resumption of production was done without posting a notice or contacting workers, so naturally only a small number of workers have returned. To attribute this to our union is misleading. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Mingqin, the Director of the Third District Public Security Bureau, and Wang Bingwen, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, came to our union to mediate. We reiterated our intention not to interfere, and they expressed their appreciation. Our union is operating as usual and has not suspended activities. The report is inaccurate and damaging to our reputation. We request that your newspaper correct this immediately to clarify the facts and avoid misunderstandings. Sincerely, The Rihua Yarn Factory Branch of the Shanghai Fifth District Cotton Textile Industry Union, April 20.</p>

<p>FREETALK Welcoming Mrs. Xiao De Ye Hua</p>
<p>Ms. Ye Hua: American Aviation Captain Robert Short, a pilot, valiantly resisted Japan in the war of resistance. Unfortunately, on February 2nd, he died in Suzhou fighting against the enemy. He sacrificed his life for a peace-loving nation. The world mourns him, and the impression he left is profound. On the afternoon of the 19th, the widow of the hero, Elizabeth Short, and her second son, Emmett, arrived in Shanghai aboard the President Taft of the Dollar Line. Mrs. Short was wearing a navy blue serge dress, with a ruddy complexion and a healthy body. However, she appeared haggard and deeply saddened, unable to overcome her grief. She silently remembered the countless nameless heroes of China who sacrificed their lives for the freedom and equality of their country, without seeking profit or fame. The countless elderly mothers who leaned on their doors, awaiting their return, only added to our infinite sorrow. Mrs. Short arrived at the customs pier baggage inspection room, where she was guided by government representatives and members of the preparatory committee, including Feng Shaoshan, Yin Zhiling, and Zhou Junshang. Film company employees and reporters all rushed to take pictures. From the pier to Mrs. Short's residence at the Cathay Hotel, a distance of about 1,200 feet, the people stood in rows, warmly welcoming her. The first row consisted of male and female students, waving Chinese and American flags to show the friendship between the two countries. The second row consisted of Boy Scouts maintaining order. The third row consisted of over 200 representatives from commercial, industrial, and other organizations. Those wearing white cloth badges with blue characters were allowed to enter the pier to welcome her, to avoid overcrowding. The preparatory committee wore white satin flower badges with numbers in the center, and black and white ribbons hanging down, with the silver words "Xiao De Righteous Commemoration Committee" in both Chinese and Western languages. The form and quality were excellent. The warm welcome of a foreigner by the Chinese people was an unprecedented event since the opening of trade. If the righteous hero knew of this, he could rest in peace. How do the young students at the forefront of the welcoming party feel? A foreigner fought and sacrificed for China, yet those who were born and raised here, what kind of return should they make to this precarious motherland?</p>
<p>The Fisherman's Enemy-Killing By Biyi</p>
<p>There are several techniques for fishing. One can fish with nets, with rods and bait, or with trained fish as lures, waiting with a gun. One can also use fragrant bait to lure fish into a basket. However, stripping naked to probe fish burrows is done in the cold of winter, when fish often hide there. One can reach in and catch them. Unable to withstand the cold, one first takes arsenic (from Xinzhou, with a white color, hence the name) to increase body heat, and then work without fear of the cold. Those experienced in this practice even swallow arsenic dissolved in wine. Those not used to it will die. When the violent Japanese attacked Yanglinkou and landed, they pillaged the nearby villages, and people scattered like birds and beasts. An old fisherman named Du, who usually fished in burrows, was filled with loyalty and a desire to kill the enemy to avenge his humiliation. He put a large amount of arsenic in a wine bottle and drank other wine himself, waiting. He had heard that the Japanese, when they wanted food or drink from our country, would make the person providing the food eat it first, to prevent poisoning. Soon, three Japanese soldiers came stumbling up to him. Seeing Du drinking wine, they gestured to him, asking for a drink. Du immediately took out the wine bottle and poured it into a cup. The Japanese gestured for him to drink first. Du raised the cup and drank it all. He then took three cups and placed them in front of the Japanese. The three men drank wildly. When the bottle was almost empty, Du went inside and exited through the back door. After a while, he looked back and saw that all three men were bleeding from their mouths and noses, dead in the room. Du then dragged the bodies to the back river and fled. Zhou Juru of Taicang told me this story. It is admirable.</p>
<p>Brief News By Li</p>

It is heard that the price will not be increased to show its excellence.</p>
<p>The Shanghai War and Armaments (15) By Yi Zang</p>
<p>The power of aircraft is recognized as the only weapon in modern warfare. Therefore, various countries have further developed their aviation networks and defense plans. For example, in the past, countries focused on harbors. Today, almost every city has an airfield for communication and defense. This is because, in the event of an emergency, they can deal with enemy aircraft attacks and avoid major sacrifices. This is an inevitable result of the times. Recalling the Shanghai War, the Japanese army used the power of aircraft to wreak havoc everywhere. Since the beginning of the war, they have transported 180 aircraft from aircraft carriers to Shanghai to disrupt the situation. Among them, more than 100 aircraft originally belonged to the Northeast. During the September 18th Incident last year, 176 aircraft were seized. They did not spend a single soldier to obtain these aircraft. They simply painted the fuselages and came to destroy Shanghai. This is extremely painful for us. According to people who escaped from the Northeast Arsenal, the aircraft seized by the Japanese army, including reconnaissance, fighter, attack, and bomber aircraft, were fully equipped and were mostly the latest models from Germany, France, and the United States. Their horizontal speed was 350 miles per hour, their endurance was 10 hours, and their rate of climb was 9,000 meters. They could also carry heavy bombers weighing 2-3 tons. From this, we can infer the magnitude of the losses in the Northeast. As for the situation of Japanese aircraft disrupting Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou during the Shanghai War, the reporter disclosed the "Shanghai Air War Record of Japanese Navy Lieutenant Odawara" in this newspaper on March 13, so I will not repeat it. Now, I will briefly describe the organization of Japanese aviation. Today, the Japanese flying team is divided into two parts. There is a manipulation and maintenance education center in Kasumigaura and a reconnaissance higher education center in Yokosuka. In addition, there are five airfields in Tateyama, Omura, Kure, Saeki, and Sasebo for the implementation of education. Recently, two new airfields are planned to be added near Tokyo Bay. In total, there are about 600 aircraft in the country. Aviation talent is emerging year by year, so when war breaks out, they can take free measures and come in teams. As for our country, since the establishment of the Aviation Office on November 10, 1919, there has been an aviation training center and an aviation factory in form. It has been more than ten years now. I ask, how many aviation talents have been trained? However, warlords across the country have purchased nearly 300 aircraft from abroad each year (excluding the Northeast). But they each occupy their own territory and wield their troops, not knowing what foreign insults are. They sing loudly that force is the backing with an empty telegram. When it comes to an emergency, they are all silent. No wonder the enemy despises our country.</p>
<p>National and Family仇(2) By Wang Tianhen</p>
<p>Although he crawled along like a drunk, he managed to crawl out of the most dangerous area unintentionally. His clothes were torn, and both his hands and face were scratched and bleeding. It was not until he felt the pain in his hands and face that he regained his senses and thought, "Where are my mother and Xiong'er? What am I doing escaping alone?" He was in pain and panicked! But the physical pain was a minor matter. Escaping alone, leaving his mother and young son at home, not knowing if they were safe, was even more painful than the physical pain! He blamed himself for abandoning his old mother and young son. He decided to return to the dangerous area! He knew that his home had been caught in the gunfire, and there was no place more dangerous! But when he thought of his seventy-year-old mother and eleven-year-old son, caught in the gunfire; and when he remembered the result of the explosion just now, which had such explosive power, what would happen if a second bomb hit his home? How could he be afraid of the dangers of gunfire and bombs, and disregard the lives of his old mother and young son? He decided to return home, without hesitation, and immediately turned around and ran wildly. But the situation had changed again. The extraordinary noise still filled his ears, but he clearly remembered that when he escaped just now, the sounds of guns and cannons were still far away. Now, they were closer. He could even hear the sound of bullets whizzing past his ears. He had no choice but to crawl along. Not far away, the bullets became more numerous. One bullet almost grazed his scalp. He reached out and touched it, feeling the heat on his short hair. He couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat. Looking around in a panic, he still could not see any light. The earth was completely controlled by darkness and terror. There was no one around. But the sounds of guns and cannons, the rumbling of airplanes, and the sounds of battle cries were all around him, not far away. He crawled along, thinking, "Crawling like this should not be dangerous. I just felt a bullet graze my scalp and touched the hot short hair. Maybe it was psychological, not a real bullet; go forward! Gather your courage and go forward!" However, he could not go forward. He could see that the battlefield was not far ahead. Although he could not see the movements of the two armies clearly, the concentrated fire of the cannons was clearer the darker it was. And the stray bullets flying in front of him were also flying more and more. Cannons are heartless things. He thought, "I don't mind sacrificing myself. This is an opportunity to repay the country. It's rare that our country's troops are resisting so bravely. I'm willing to join the fight; but my old mother and young son have not escaped danger yet. This body must be preserved; moreover, I can't sacrifice myself in such a muddled way. I'll have to find another way to get home!" So he lay on the ground to rest for a while, looking to both sides and choosing a path. Because he had been crawling for a long time, his hands and face were scratched and in severe pain, and he was very tired, he had to rest a little and then change direction.</p>

<p>Frenzied Gold Market: Stormy Winds and Conflicting News Stir Up Powerful Waves</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market experienced violent fluctuations. Like a storm, the momentum was unstoppable, rising and falling by several to more than ten taels at a time, with a daily high-low range of over twenty-six or twenty-seven taels. However, the net result was a drop of just over two taels, which was difficult to fathom. The market opened with gains, driven by the silver market's decline. Later, it briefly exceeded 720 taels. However, a series of adverse events unfolded, including a Reuters report that the United States was considering restoring the exchange rate between the US dollar and British pound to the levels of 1926, above $4.80. If Britain did not agree, the United States was considering abandoning the gold standard. Following this, news of active bank meetings in the United States frequently surfaced, causing widespread panic among dealers. Large players rushed to sell, creating a tidal wave of selling pressure and a sharp decline in exchange rates. Gold prices plunged by more than twenty taels, briefly breaking through the 700-tael mark. However, the market rebounded around noon, climbing back above 710 taels, driven by a stabilization in exchange rates and reports that a certain bank bought 300 bars of spot gold. This was the most significant market turbulence seen this year. The market's chaotic conditions were unexpected. Trading was quiet in the afternoon, as it was Wednesday and the market lacked exchange rate transactions, leading to minimal fluctuations. The day's details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden Decline at Market Opening: From the opening in the June contract, prices added 3.30 taels to reach 719 taels. Big strips and American silver both fell by 1/8, and private telegrams went down by 1/16, boosting market sentiment. Yuhe and others eagerly bought, pushing prices up by 7 taels, reaching 25.8 taels around 9:20 AM. The British gold announcement remained unchanged, while the American dollar declined slightly by 1.25, causing exchange rates to fall by 2.625 points. However, gold prices fluctuated between 24.3 taels and 25 taels. Subsequently, sellers became active, and prices fell by 4-5 taels. After 10:00 AM, prices were around 720 taels. A flood of unfavorable news then hit the gold market, including rumors of the United States restoring previous exchange rates or abandoning the gold standard. Widespread panic ensued, and prices continued to fall by 3-4 taels. By 10:30 AM, prices were at 16.8 taels, and then stabilized at 18.2 taels. A new wave of selling then hit, driven by rumors that the United States was strongly supporting silver prices. Dede Cheng and other firms rushed to sell, causing prices to plummet almost 20 taels in less than half an hour, reaching a low of 699 taels at 11:10 AM, with American dollars available at 31.875 yuan and British gold at 1 shilling and 8 pence. Buyers then stepped in, with short positions being covered by Hengxing and others. News that a bank had opened cash positions sent prices soaring by 14-15 taels, reaching 714 taels at 11:45 AM. The noon close was at 11.8 taels, with the official price adjusted to 780 taels, a difference of 58 taels, later increasing to over 81 taels and then 67-68 taels at midday.</p>
<p>Afternoon: Calm Return and Stabilization: The afternoon market opened at 12.5 taels, then fluctuated between 13.2 taels and 11.5 taels, with limited trading. Tai Chang and others then entered the market, pushing prices up by 3 taels, reaching 14.5 taels at 2:15 PM. Subsequent fluctuations were within 2 taels, as the market lacked exchange rate transactions and the number of transactions was small. After 3:00 PM, Dede Cheng and others sold off, pushing prices down by 4 taels to 10.02 taels at 3:50 PM. Prices then rebounded slightly, fluctuating within 1-2 taels. The market closed at 13.2 taels at 4:30 PM, down 2.5 taels compared to the previous day, then moved up to around 14 taels due to retail buying. The maximum price for the day was 725.8 taels, and the minimum price was 699 taels, a difference of 26.8 taels. The official price difference ranged from 70 to 66-67 taels. The accounting price for May-June was 712 taels, as swap contracts had already been cleared, with a supplementary payment of 12 taels in the morning and 13 taels in the afternoon. The red line added 5 taels.</p>
<p>Active Buying and Selling: Trading statistics on the trading floor showed that Shunli, Wanxing, Bingxing, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, and Yifengyong all bought, while Yucheng, Tongtaichang, Yuantai, Chengfengyong, Zhifengyong, Fuyu, Yuanheng, Yuanmaoyong, Daxingyong, Yiyu, and Yifeng all sold. Mr. Wu had some buying and selling activity. In the afternoon, most transactions were retail. Dalian Gang and Yuanmaoyong both bought, while Dede Cheng and Hengyu both sold.</p>

The Hong Kong rate increased by 1.25, the German mark fell slightly by 0.75, the French franc decreased by 5 yuan, the Japanese yen decreased by 0.25, and the Indian rupee remained unchanged. The banking sector displayed both British flat and American firm trends. While there were fluctuations during the morning, they were not as dramatic as in the gold market. The market tightened in the morning, followed by easing, and then a recovery at noon. The British gold rate was similar to the previous day, while the US dollar rate decreased by 1.15. The volume of transactions was not very high, primarily due to the volatility of the gold market. British gold transactions were estimated at 60,000-70,000 pounds, while US dollar transactions were estimated at 400,000-500,000 yuan. Gold industry dealers remained active, and interbank transactions continued. A Bombay telegram offered near-term shillings. In the afternoon, the market was typically inactive due to Wednesday.</p>

<p>Lack of Positive Prospects for Yarn and Cotton Sales; Minimal Demand in Southern China</p>
<p>The yarn market is extremely depressed. Sales in various regions are sluggish. The most promising area, Southern China, is experiencing a financial panic in Guangzhou, with silver shops closing one after another. Market instability has further hampered yarn sales. Market sentiment is weakening, and factories are willing to compromise. Tianjin has seen some activity, but other areas have seen no movement. Prices are declining, and inventories are accumulating, creating a concerning outlook. Statistics show that 500 bales were purchased by various regions throughout the day, including 65 bales by fellow merchants, 60 bales by customers from inland areas, 195 bales by Tianjin, 95 bales by northern regions, 40 bales by Guangdong, and 20 bales by Luzhou. Prices fell by 0.25-0.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton: British Up, American Down</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially strengthened due to favorable news from Liverpool, but weakened due to a downturn on Wall Street and profit-taking. Futures fell by 4-5 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 2-3 points, and spot prices rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton trading was suspended. The original telegram records are as follows</p>
<h3 id="e91">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram to Hunan and Anhui Requesting Exemption from Rice Tax to Regulate Food Supply for the People <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the food problem in the city relies entirely on imported rice. However, Hunan and Anhui provinces levy excessively high rice taxes, preventing the rice from being transported out, which hinders the regulation of surplus and deficit, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, a telegram was sent to the National Government and the provincial governments of Hunan and Anhui, requesting an exemption from the rice tax to maintain the people's food supply. The text reads: "To the Executive Yuan in Luoyang, the Hunan Provincial Government in Changsha, and the Anhui Provincial Government in Anqing: Last year, due to floods in the Yangtze River basin, farmland was devastated. This year, with the military operations in Songhu, the areas of Suzhou, Songjiang, and Taicang are threatened by Japanese invaders, and defensive preparations have delayed plowing in many fields, leading to anticipated food shortages. Last year, the number of imported foreign rice reached 10,736,000 dan, totaling 60,214,000 taels of silver. Considering this year's situation, the amount of imported foreign rice may exceed last year's. At a time when the people are impoverished and resources are depleted, an additional loss of over 100 million yuan per year to purchase foreign rice is unbearable for the national economy and people's livelihood. Rice merchants have repeatedly reported that Anhui and Hunan provinces have abundant rice reserves, sufficient for relief. However, due to the rice tax in these two provinces, the cost of transporting rice to Shanghai is high, about thirteen yuan per stone. Foreign rice in Shanghai generally sells for just over ten yuan and under eleven yuan. With such a significant price difference, rice merchants have no choice but to purchase cheaper foreign rice for market sales. This results in hundreds of millions in national losses. Farmers in Hunan and Anhui provinces also deeply feel the lack of export channels and suffer from low grain prices, making their hard work throughout the year insufficient to cover the costs of farming. Although the provincial treasury may gain some revenue, it is truly a loss for the national economy. Therefore, we sincerely implore your esteemed Yuan and Governments to review and approve an order to exempt the current rice tax in Hunan and Anhui provinces, so that rice from other provinces can be transported with reduced obstacles, achieving the benefits of mutual exchange and avoiding the outflow of wealth. We would be immensely grateful. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e92">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegram to the Ministry of Communications Requesting Exemption from Increased Postage for Books <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Appealing for a Reduction of Four or Five Yuan in Reading Costs for Students</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the recent increase in postage rates for books announced by the Ministry of Communications will increase the burden on students and hinder cultural progress, outweighing any benefits. Therefore, a telegram was sent to the National Government's Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications, urging them to consider the bigger picture and approve the old rates to benefit education. The original telegram reads: "To the Executive Yuan of the National Government in Luoyang and the Ministry of Communications: On the 19th of this month, the Book Industry Association stated in a letter that the Ministry of Communications' new regulations for increased postage rates for books are as follows: (1) Provinces directly connected by land or with railway access will maintain the original rates; (2) Areas without direct railway access will have rates doubled; (3) Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou will have rates tripled. In reality, there are many complex provisions that are easily misunderstood. A small primary school textbook, thin ones sell for six fen, thick ones sell for one jiao. The original postage was one or two fen, but now it will be two or four fen for areas without railway access, and three or six fen for Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Shaanxi. It is estimated that a primary school student will use about one hundred books in six years, meaning students in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou will have to pay an additional four or five yuan in reading costs. Even counties and towns in other provinces that are not directly connected to Jiangsu or do not have railway access will have to pay an additional two or three yuan. This will significantly hinder cultural education. The attached letter from the affiliated association to the government is respectfully submitted, requesting your intervention to plead on behalf of readers in the inland. We earnestly hope for your support. The various provinces' cultures are consistently proportional to transportation. The northwest and southwest are particularly backward, and education funding is extremely limited. If the newly ordered book postage increases are implemented, the expenses of each school will suddenly increase, making it difficult to bear, inevitably shifting the burden to the students. This will not only deprive those who have not yet entered school of the opportunity to study but also cause those already enrolled to drop out due to poverty and difficulty in raising tuition. Is this truly the original intention of the Yuan and Ministry to promote national culture? The businesses sell books, and the postage is borne by the users, so the increase in book postage does not affect the businesses themselves. The reason they go to such lengths is for the overall situation, hoping that our country's culture can develop evenly. It is remembered that the country's transportation construction has always heavily favored the Yangtze River basin. Inland and remote areas have already been greatly disadvantaged, and now using this as an excuse to increase book postage is tantamount to depriving them of transportation rights, and even depriving them of the right to education, falling far short of the goal of civilizing and transforming customs. Moreover, according to the book industry's estimate, the number of books sent by mail is no more than two or three million per year, and the postal fees collected amount to only several hundred thousand. Even if the national treasury is extremely depleted, for the sake of promoting education in remote provinces and counties, it is essential to consider the bigger picture. Therefore, we respectfully submit this telegram to your esteemed Yuan and Ministry for review, requesting that you approve the collection of book postage in provinces and counties with inconvenient transportation at the old rates, as it is truly in the public interest. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows respectfully."</p>

<p>Five Items Agreed Upon... Temple Fair for Seven Days</p>
<p>The scope of the Jing'an Temple Incense Fair for the Buddha's Birthday in this port has expanded in recent years, significantly impacting traffic and the area's existing commerce. The Municipal Council consulted with the abbot of the temple, Zhifa, and agreed upon five measures, which the abbot has responded to in writing, acknowledging their acceptance. The measures are as follows: (1) Starting in 1932, the annual temple fair will be limited to the locations marked in red on the attached map. The marked locations include parts of Jing'an Temple Road, Hart Road, Avenue Haig, Jessfield Road, Jiaozhou Road, Yuyuan Road, and Haig Road. (2) The duration of this temple fair will be limited to a maximum of seven days. (3) The Municipal Council may, if it deems necessary, notify the temple authorities six months in advance to reconsider the area and permitted locations for the temple fair. (4) Stall locations are limited to the sidewalks alongside the designated roads and must not encroach upon the roads. Sufficient space must be left on the sidewalks to allow easy passage for residences, shops, automobile traffic, and other properties along the roads. (5) These regulations are valid only as long as the current location of Jing'an Temple remains unchanged. This year's incense fair will be held from May 8th to May 14th.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Regulations for Stamp Duty on Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, stating: "The Shanghai Special District Citizens' Union has sent a telegram requesting a reduction in stamp duty penalties and a revision of the stamp duty posting method for tobacco and alcohol licenses. The Ministry has acknowledged the telegram. After investigation, the current stamp duty penalties range from a minimum of five yuan to a maximum of one hundred yuan, which is already a significant reduction compared to the amended tax law of the Republic of China, where the maximum penalty was two hundred yuan. Furthermore, this is stipulated by regulations and has been in effect for a long time, making it difficult to arbitrarily change. There are also explicit clauses in the regulations regarding the stamp duty posting for tobacco and alcohol licenses, which provinces have followed for many years, making it difficult for your province to deviate. However, for the sake of convenience in the actual procedure of posting stamp duty for these licenses, each province's tobacco and alcohol license collection agencies should be allowed to follow the tax rate set by the Ministry when issuing licenses and post the stamps accordingly.

<p>The Minli Middle School in this city has been established for many years. Graduates serving in society are found in all sectors and have earned the trust of the general public. Recently, Xu Xuchang and Su Zuqing, classmates of the 1928 class (the first graduating class under the new system), initiated a reunion on the 17th of this month at the Duoyi Restaurant on Avenue Edward, as it will soon be four years since they left school, and communication among classmates has been scarce. Twenty to thirty people attended, creating a lively gathering. Wang Zongpu, Xu Xuchang, Xia Xingshi, Su Zuqing, and Wang Xingbo were appointed as a drafting committee for the class reunion association to facilitate its progress. The primary goals are "mutual assistance" and "cultivating community life." It is reported that a general meeting will be held soon.</p>

<p>Chen Weiru, a Suzhou native and comprador of the Kalie Foreign Firm at No. 105 Jiangxi Road, borrowed 14,000 taels of silver from the Bank of China twice on April 30th of last year, falsely using the firm's name. As he has failed to repay the debt, Wang Zhenshen, the firm's representative, recently discovered his actions. Believing that Chen had committed fraud and breach of trust, he reported the matter to the General Police Station. The Chinese detective Song Yuanshan was dispatched to No. 172 Sichuan Road to arrest and detain him. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Summary Court of the First Special District. Both the plaintiff and defendant hired lawyers to appear in court. After Judge Jiang Hechun briefly questioned him, he ordered Chen Weiru to be detained for a further hearing next Saturday.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Those Going to Zhabei Must Obtain a Japanese Military Pass <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Headquarters has announced that all foreigners, including Japanese, who wish to go to Zhabei for business must carry an official pass issued by the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Headquarters or the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Office at No. 1036 Xinmin Road. Those entering and exiting via North Sichuan Road must enter via Xibaoxing Road and exit via Qiujiang Road to avoid traffic congestion. Those entering and exiting from the western district of the concession must take the Maigen Road Bridge. Those who have not obtained an official pass can obtain a temporary pass from the Japanese soldiers at the aforementioned entrances to obtain an official pass from the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Office. However, in the area between the Songhu Railway and Hongkou Creek to the east, the public can enter and exit without a pass.</p>
