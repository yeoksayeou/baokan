<h3 id="c1">如何挽救中國經濟上之危機彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>邇近穆藕初氏在本報發表「中國經濟上的危機」一文。從出口與入口價值之數字上。指示産業先進國對我國經濟侵略之猛進。復從進口貨物類别之比較上。指示進口洋貨百分之九十以上皆爲消耗品。而生産工具之機器。僅佔百分之三·三八。認此爲我國經濟上顯著之病象。亦即我國經濟前途莫大之危機。末則以剷除生産障礙。節制洋貨進口。努力推廣國貨三事。爲挽救經濟危機之耍着。勗國人共起勵行。語重心長。發人深省。吾人請就推廣國貨一點。爲廣其說并從而求其實行之道。</p>
<p>自鴉片一戰。帝國主義者以槍砲敲破我寗寂之門户。而其工業生産品。乃如潮擁來。在我國内。則復有但知牟利之商人。與食人殘餘之買辦。甘心投入外國資本家之肘腋。爲其經濟侵略之先鋒隊與經紀人。高價之尖貨擁入。賤價之原料輸出。在此一出一入之間。我手工業乃受其排擠。農業遭其壓迫。國民之血肉。日被其榨取以去。百年以還。我國乃長困於朽腐與凋落之慘境。迄於今茲。更危機顯呈。奄奄一息。試就入口貨物之品類而觀。我之衣食住行四者。今亦無不操之人手。事之可危可怖。孰逾於此。瞻顧前途。誠令人不寒而慄。　　至於在社會方面。則近年以來。習日趨於奢靡。俗日趨於虚華。小康之家即衣非洋貨不着。食非洋貨不甘。器用亦非洋貨不使。若豪富之家。權貴之門。子女妻孥。食無所事。惟知窮奢極欲。競奇鬥富。衣食住行。更無一而非洋貨。且無一而不選取價值最昻之品。即男女大學生。亦大都徒飾外表。衣必洋裝。用必洋貨。其他種種之消耗品。如髮油·如擦面粉·如肥皂·如手帕·如紙烟·更無一而非來自巴黎紐約倫敦等地·人以服用洋貨爲　而以服用國貨爲恥人以奢靡爲豪闊而以儉樸爲鄙陋。奢靡之風。以都市爲中心。漸以及於内地洋貨之擁進。亦以都市爲中心。漸以流入窮鄉僻壞。於是國貨乃無人過問駸成奄奄一息之勢。洋貨則充斥市廛。勢且蒸蒸而日興。而我國民經濟。則日趨於血盡皮枯之絕境。</p>
<p>故我國今日而欲挽救經濟之危機。推廣國貨。實爲其最要之一端。而欲推廣國貨。則必矯正都市奢靡之風氣。而提倡儉樸。必矯正國人愛用洋貨之心理。而提倡國貨。必於衣食住行以及舉凡日用之所需。先求之於國貨。非萬不得已。不用洋産。由一人以及於一家。由一家以及於社會。上海爲奢靡之發源地。亦爲洋貨之大市塲。上海之風氣而轉移。則風行草偃。内地亦無不翕然相從矣。</p>
<p>又如靑。年學生。爲我國家未來之主人。尤必養成其儉樸之習慣。與愛用國貨之心理。以樹立未來之根基。吾人認爲本年暑假後。敎育當局應嚴令全國公私大中小學校。首先絕對禁止男女學生衣着洋貨。崇尚奢華。一切用品。除决不可少之敎育用品外。必求之於國貨。師長亦必以身作則。爲學生先。學生而不遵行者。拒絕其入學。更如行政公務人員。以及其家屬。政府當局亦應下嚴厲命令。禁止其衣着洋貨。使用洋産。旣以倡儉約之風。亦以養其　。其不遵行者予以嚴罰或罷黜之。行之久遠。吾人蓋敢斷言其必可徵鉅大之實效。設使政治當局與敎育當局。并此一事而亦不能使用權力。督促實行。則其他政治之改革。敎育之改進。均爲空談。吾人切勿以此爲卑無足道。彼印度以土布抵制洋布。所收之實效。即爲我國今日最好之借鏡也</p>
<p>他如國内之實業家與金融家。亦必放大其眼光。母計目前之小利母慮目前之小失。以民族之福利爲前提。以有計劃之行動。謀實業之發展以通力合作。謀進行之順利。必如是而後民族之實業可興。國貨之銷行可暢。而經濟之危機。可漸得以挽救。他如剷除生産障礙。抑制洋貨進口。容當於來日繼續申論之。</p>

<p>捕房嚴防工人破壞</p>
<p>工人又開代表大會</p>
<p>租界電話公司工人罷工、自談判决裂後、形勢愈趨嚴重、捕房防範、亦甚嚴密、罷委昨開代表大會、工頭姚岳生、又被毆打、自動機雖照常通話、但聲音低濁、茲將各項情形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>防範益嚴　自談判决裂後、公共租界捕房、得公司之要求、深恐罷工工人、破壞自動機通話、昨晨、江西路中央行·福建路新中央行·海寗路北行·麥特赫司脫路斬行·畢勛路法南行·敏體尼隆路新法南行·　山路東行·億定盤路路升行·楊樹浦修理廠等門首、由捕房增派中西武裝探捕駐守、防範益嚴、禁止聞人出入、對於公司高級華員、亦須盤問、</p>
<p>勉强通話　公司對於罷工委員會提出之條件、完全拒絕、並不承認罷委、僅准工人無條件復工、同時請捕房派捕保護、以免工人阻止通話、惟因罷工迄今、已有九日、加以天氣潮濕、自動機試綫間·馬達間·地綫間·　綫間·藏氣間·天綫間·工人、大都已加入罷工、例如上午八時下午五時深夜十二時工人調班時、必將自動機試騐、有無損壞、現不得已減少、因此通話聲音、不甚清響、且嫌遲緩、但公司正在儘量設法恢復、</p>
<p>工頭被毆　昨晨福建路新裝間工頭華人姚岳生關照新裝間工人、公司對於罷工委員會提出之基本條件、已有相當接受、望速進公司復工、於是二百餘工人、於上午十時、相率進公司、準備復工、嗣不見工頭、當詢問工程師威爾遜、知全非事實、即於十一時全體退出、在湖北路青蓮閣附近、適遇工頭、羣起責問、並將該工頭毆打、幸未致傷、</p>
<p>工頭態度　新聲社記者昨在遠束餟店一百十三號詢問各工頭對罷工態度、據云、此次全體工人、爲不堪忍受帝國主義的資本家壓迫而罷工、工頭處於同等地位、自當一致行動、决不破壞罷工紀律、對於罷委、並無成見、且很誠意合作、一致向資本家奮鬥、此次罷委對於各工頭之行爲、實出誤會、</p>
<p>代表大會　江西路總行曁各分行、前日分别會議、推出新代表、參加罷委工作、昨日上午、向通商旅舘報到、罷工委員會即於昨日下午四時、舉行全體代表大會、討論對付公司辦法、聞（一）堅持繼續罷工、以求最後之勝利、（二）各區各問募捐隊、一律出發、向各界籌募罷工基金、（三）對於破壞罷工紀律者、交罷工法庭審判、</p>

<p>其他　　　百分之二十五</p>
<p>以本年三月二十七日起算</p>
<p>公共租界工部局情報處發表消息云、本星期三、工部局董事會會議已允許電話公司之請求、依照公司特許合同第十三欵將電話增價、查電話增價問題、曾經公用委員會提出討論、結果、委員會建議、允該公司之請、照安生氏之報告數目增價、並於報告中未明白提及之項、援照加增、自一九三二年三月二十七日爲始、當時工部局總辦、並曾向該委員會提出一節略、陳述兩租界工部局代表與公司代表所討論之結果、</p>
<p>因銀價跌落之故、公司之資本支出、較安生氏原估之數、增多百分之十四、又查安生氏之報告中、有重大之缺點、如照文字實行、則公司將失所允增價之利、安生氏於電話價目表、未逐項提及、如於所未提者仍照原額、則破綻甚多、增價多可藉以規避、是以工部局之代表、以爲最善之法、似莫過於將安生氏之數目改正、使可實行、即三月二十七日爲始、同時關於更行加高之請求、即予以調查、如果合理、則當在將來商定之日實行之、</p>
<p>據財務處長之意見、安生氏之建議、爲將營業電話增百分之三十四點六、其他增百分之二十五、至公司方面之主張、未經明定之項目、自未欲其依然照舊、渠認爲公平、故現時公司所提之價表、已照安生氏之比例、將未經明言之項開入、但仍有數項裝費及他用費未加、惟對暫時裝設一項之費、則超過安生之比例、此乃欲使暫用之費較常用爲高也、故財務處長認公司所擬之表、實與安生報告之文字、或精神相符、建議請董事會批准、</p>
<p>旋由總辦聲稱、此時工部局所核准者、只係因於安生氏價率之加價請求、若將來再請增價、則公司應提出詳細說明於兩租界工部局、又財務副處長聲稱、渠得法租界代表之報告、該代表亦準備向法租界工部局建議採納公司所擬定之價單云、</p>
<p>又公用委員某君詢問、如採用安生氏之價目、是否應追溯至三月二十七日、即由該委員會主席答稱、照特許合同、工部局不能不允許此節、某委員又稱、爲避免用户誤會起見、應將所准之改訂價目充公公怖、並應明白宣布、將來如再議加價、非經兩秀界工部局將公司之詳細說明充分考慮、不能允許、意衆委員皆表同意云</p>

<p>保留賠償　吳淞機廠於一二八事變後、即被日軍佔領、當時内部機器馬達等物、均淪入日人手中、因我方路局人員、不及預先運出、嗣雖接管、但我方路局人員、因見廠中物件損失甚多、故於接管之時、曾向日方代表時澤直義聲明、缺少物件甚多、暫時不能接收、日方堅决不允、當時我方處於强權之下、暫行隱忍接收、并簽引繼書、該書略謂、一切佔領物件、均已引繼與華方、當時我方對於廠中所缺少物件之賠償問題、仍聲明保留、且有在塲之西人中英銀公司代表及工務處長等、可爲證人、</p>
<p>日方卸責　最近日方代表岡崎·向共同委員會聲明、謂關於吳淞機廠、因日方移交時、曾與華方簽引繼書、載明一切物件、均已引渡華方、故此後對於吳淞機廠問題、與日方無涉云、</p>
<p>兩路局函　共同委員會嗣以此點、轉知我方接管委員會、接管會即轉函兩路局、查詢其中眞實情形、究屬如何、路局乃於昨日、函復接管會、略謂當時雖簽訂引繼書、但對於機廠内一切物件損失之賠償二點、仍聲明保留、日方當然不能卸責云云、</p>
<p>中英交涉　中英銀公司因此次日軍於作戰時、侵佔吳淞機廠、及損壞物件甚多、該公司以借欵關係、亦同日方交涉賠償、又路局刻正着手詳查吳淞機廠之損失、以備交涉時之根據云、</p>

<p>不除庭草齋夫二十八</p>
<p>朱先生寫的這幾句話可就把我弄糊塗了。依我從前的意思看來，是先有知識而後有行動。現在朱先生以行動爲老子，知識爲兒子，創造爲孫子，恰恰與我的意思相反。如果我是對的，他必定是錯了。假使他是對的，我必定是錯了。我思來想去，不能說我一定對，也不能說他一定錯，我是在一個圓圈裏打轉，我不着出路。我自己不能自圓其說，終於問朱先生要證據來說明他的主張。</p>
<p>朱先生問我：『你知道騎牛嗎？』我說：『知道』。『你這騎牛的知識是如何得來的？『』在牛背上騎幾回就會了』。『好，騎牛是行動，會騎是知識，那麽知識是行動裏産生出來的，不是嗎？』『對·』</p>
<p>朱先生又問：『你知道游水嗎』？我說；『知道』。『你再想想那游水的知識是如何得來的』？『在水裏游幾回就會了』。『好，游水是行動，會游是知識，又可見知識是從行動裏産生出來的，不是嗎』？『對·』</p>
<p>我想了一忽兒，反問朱先生：『我們知道火是燙人的，遇了火便縮手。知火炎人是知識。遇火縮手是行動。這不是先知而後行嗎』？朱先生說：『火是什麽？燙人又是什麽？你是生來就知道的嗎？』『我想不是生來就知道的。說不定是人家告訴我的。』『人家可以告訴你火是燙人的也可以告訴你火是氷人的，誰眞誰假，你如何判斷，如何分别，如何知道？你怎麽知道火一定是燙人的，火一定不是氷人的？你怎麽知道那告訴你火是燙人的是說眞話？又怎麽知道那告訴你火是氷人的是說假話？』『我想拿手在火上試一試便知道了。』『對·你在你媽媽懷抱裏的時候有一次伸手玩火，被火燙了，便知道火是個厲害的東西所以後見着火就把手縮去。伸手玩火是行動，知道火燙人手是知識。這不是證明先行而後知嗎？』</p>

<p>江浙這樣大的地方，聽說近來到處發生瘟雞，瘟狗，瘟貓，而且這般畜生身上都發現刀傷血跡，鄉下人都非常驚駭，人家都說有鬼。鬼在那裏盡符，符飛到那裏，瘟疫也就傳到那裏。</p>
<p>從畜生瘟疫聯想到鬼　符，再從鬼畫符聯想到從前埃及，倒有一件故事。從前埃及地方，猶太人很多，約有五六十萬，埃及人看到猶太人口一天一天的增加，非常恐慌，後來想出種種方法來苛待他們，最後用秘密的毒辣的手段將猶太人的長子一個一個都殺死，弄得住在埃及的猶太人都很駭怪，幸虧梅瑟出來，猶太人纔得了救星。</p>
<p>話回頭來，如果眞有鬼能畫符咒，那末日本貨就是符。我們受了符咒的迷，日本人還要來殺我們，殺得家破人亡，正是自作孶，活該自受了。然而明知符咒是禍根，還是信用符咒，迷信符咒，請問良心在那裏？尤其是這班販買仇貨的人，他們祗管賺錢，明知符咒似的仇貨足以殺人，也就不在意了。吾看，他們喪心病狂，總有一天，禍根爆發，比虹口公園的炸彈還要厲</p>

<p>張恨水君久居北平。雖是原籍安徽。而未免有些兒北平化了。去年他遷居大棚欄。庭圜楚楚。頗有花木之勝。恨水走筆著作其間。雖很辛勞。精神上却也得到不少安慰。所以文興愈高。著作愈多。誰知最近竟遇到了一件大不幸的事。那可怕的猩紅熱。竟會和這文字勞工作起對頭來。生生地奪去了他兩顆掌上明珠。致使他再也没有心緒從事著作。而各方催稿的信函。還是像雪片般飛去。逼得他欲罷不能。不得不提起筆來。勉强的向故紙堆中討生活。唉·這正是一幕小小的人生悲劇。我念恨水。又不禁爲辛勞的自己撫膺一歎咧。</p>
<p>恨水在「啼笑因緣」結束之後。曾來滬一游。我們時相過從。宴飲無虚夕。彼此暢叙之餘。深知他的爲人亢爽。有齊魯間人風。而我所最引爲同調的。便是愛看電影。著作之暇。就高坐電影院中。欣賞銀幕上的形形色色。我曾對他說。「我讀了你的那部「啼笑因緣」。就知道你愛看電影了。因爲你描寫書中人的動作。十分細膩。正與好電影中的注意於小動作相同。你可算得是一位小說界中的劉别謙啊」恨水雖謙遜不遑。却也引爲知言。</p>
<p>恨水在滬約一月。曾屢往明星公司。商略攝製「啼笑因緣」影片的事。搜羅了許多北平名勝的照片。以供明星同人的參考。對於書中人物的個性與身分。又細爲說明。臨行時特别鄭重。更將編製劇本的事重重委託了獨鶴。當時原想攝無聲影片的。但是明星同人爲盡善盡美起見。特地向美國好蘭塢採辦有聲機器。趕往北平去實地攝取。恨水盡力贊助。忙得不可開交。大家費了無窮的心力。到如今纔大功告成了。聽得獨鶴說。此片不但有聲。并且有色。而所有說明。完全是他的手筆。將來公映時。定可轟動一時。所可惜的。恨水遠在北平。不能一快先覩。預料他得了這奸消息。定很歡喜。但是想起了他個人的不幸。又不免鬱鬱。怕也和「啼笑因緣」中的人物一樣。有些啼笑皆非吧。</p>

<p>英國王宫中的食單凡是一般幸運的人。得以身入白金漢宫。Buckingham參加英王英后的朝會的。大都是因了天顔咫尺。凛凛然惟恐有失儀之處。再也吃不下甚麽東西了。尤其是那些第一次入宫覲見的剛成年的姑娘們。拘謹得特别厲害。然而宫中的綠客室GreenDrawingRoom中。仍照例的備有飲食。要是伊們忽覺飢俄的話。儘可以一快朶頥。其食單如下。</p>

<p>我們在古老的崇高的興化城墻頂上，憑　高下瞰着全城景色，一時映進我們眼簾的，宛如一座大花園一般，美麗呀！這一個中國南部的城市·葱靑油綠的顔色，籠罩着全城，幾乎無處不滿長着樹木·在這些樹木之中，大多數是桂圓樹，也就是中國人谷諺所謂的「龍眼」樹·這種菓樹的栽植，是當地人民生財之一大富源，在興化城裏，有許多人都專靠這職業過活的·而出産的桂圓菓子，則大部份銷售於上海·</p>
<p>在每年初夏時分，大概五月裏光景，從别處來到興化的客人，也許會遙遙地隱約辨認出，在許多桂圓樹上，棲息着幾隻罕見稀有的大怪鳥·但是，一等到他跑近了樹身，仔細觀看的時候，便立刻會得發覺，那些攀伏在由於樹枝所構成的天然梯子上的，並不眞是什麽大怪鳥，而是身邊挾着刈刀的園丁們呀·</p>
<p>在别人看來，他們這種職業，似乎帶有極高度的危險性，尤其是在刮着大風的天氣·可是，事實告訴我們的，從來誰也不曾聽到說：「一個園丁曾從桂圓樹上跌下來過」的故事·這些園丁們都耐着性兒，在每一根樹枝上，細細地埋頭工作·非但枯死的枝幹，要一根一根</p>

<p>的截斷下來，還得把差不多一半模樣的樹葉，和一大半的花朶，一概剪凈·所以一顆修剪過了的桂圓樹，總不免顯出一副樹葉稀少，花朶零落的樣子了·可是要不這樣，秋來的吸穫，是難望豐滿的·除了修剪之外，還須相當的肥料，大概一年四次的澆糞，是不可少的，倘若希望菓子質地佳美的話·</p>
<p>秋天八九月裏，樹上的桂圓，都已成熟·一叢叢黄褐色的菓子，掛在枝頭，和綠葉掩映着，眞是多麽美麗可愛！它的滋味極美，一種特殊的香味，異常可口，别種鮮菓是無論如何比不上它的·菓肉中間，包着一個烏黑的核球，中國人說是像龍的眼睛：所以替這種菓子起一個别名，呌做「龍眼·」雖然龍的眼睛是否是這個樣子，還屬一個疑問，似乎誰也不敢斷定·</p>
<p>桂圓樹木的質地，是以堅硬耐久著稱的；而且條紋光滑細膩，可愛得很·這種木材，大都是用來作小桌子，燭盤，或是照相架子的·桂圓樹木的出産，數量極有限·因爲這種樹木，生長得非常慢，而壽命却又特别長久，普通一顆桂圓樹，能夠開花結菓，大約一百年左右·如果特别培養得好的話，那麽恐怕還不止呢·</p>

<p>棉紗市晨漲午疲、因美棉回漲、而本埠以已跌多日、反動本起、於是人心帶、一般獲利者乘機扒空、市盤遂略見轉機、但内地情形、依然枯荒不堪、人民生計日蹙、四方匪患猖獗、而金融奇枯、故各方購買力較弱、因之各廠囤貨有一部份已有困難之苦、所以邇來市况、較花市爲軟弱矣、</p>
<p>人標漲後復跌　　人標前市開盤、隨美棉上漲一兩五六錢、二三盤平平、午後市氣又見軟化、且有人套出、各月跌六七錢、全日成交統計三萬二千三百包、查賣出吉豐一千六百五十包、源德一千八百包森康九百包、益昶七百包、買進賡豐一千零五十包、長豐一千包、信誠六百包同興六百五十包、茲將人標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<p>棉市趨堅、因美棉回漲、而本埠人心已覺轉機、且寗波帮前以該處市價暴落、賣出無人接受、曾來滬套出有一萬多擔、今日將前之額量、如數抵進、於是漲風又緊、但實際上觀察、仍無極大漲力、不過近日跌勢太猛、因之反動亦速、查各廠購進之原料、足可供給八九個月之需用、因之滬上各堆棧存棉置漸見增加、據高爾庭洋行調查、上海美棉存貨有十五萬一千多件云、</p>
<p>標棉續漲七錢　鄭標前市開盤、以美棉回漲、塲中買户增加、形勢突緊、各月漲六七錢、午後開盤平平、跌三四錢、二三盤又漲二錢、全日成交統計九萬三千五百擔、查賣出賡豐七千二百擔、同餘一千六百擔、信誠二千一百擔、益豐二千三百擔、同興二千三百擔、買進穗隆五千八百擔、餘昶七千六百擔、長豐三千擔、茲將鄭標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>我國當局，現在大談其對俄復交問題，曾决定兩項原則，兩個步驟，但蘇俄在現在情勢之下，是否肯與我國復交，這也是一個疑問。</p>
<p>譬如我到某公園中去追求女性，但該女郎是否肯接受我的追求，亦是問題，或者嫌我老了，或者嫌我不漂亮，這種追求，就是呌做「單想思」，倘然接受了，或者僅僅爲友誼上的關係，不肯犧牲她的色相，也是「有情人難成眷屬』。　　現在我國應與蘇俄復交，是個問題，蘇俄肯與我復交，也是個問題，復交之後，蘇俄肯爲我犧牲色相，又是個問題，一則日本聞中俄有復交之訊，（不一定在報紙上看見）早已計劃，恢復日俄邦交，我國已步後塵，二則蘇俄新五年計劃，尚未成功之前，似不願與日開釁，即使復交，亦屬無益。</p>
<p>又據前日本報電訊，「俄方不似以前之渴望即日通商與派使，惟如華方切望中俄政府回復邦交，彼國亦願談談，」據此消息，則蘇俄全無誠意與我國同復邦交可知，一則曰如「華方切望」，再則曰「亦願談談」，其冷淡而無誠意的態度，早在言外，而據昨日京訊，致引起對復交問題，因報紙披露過早，致引起對方誤會，現擬用另一方法進行云云，又是如羅外長所說的「一經洩露功虧一簣」的不是麽，這呌做「殺人不怪怪磨刀」。</p>

<p>— 唐思誠</p>
<p>照相製版，爲應用化學之一，攝底片爲最重要之事，奈國人舊習，素重筆上工夫，多以修版爲首要，而對於化學作用製版原理，不之注意，豈不是舍本求末乎，此亦製版無進步原因之一也，今試舉毛玻璃照相鉛皮製版法之大概於左。</p>
<p>（一）如一張彩色原稿，欲製七套顔色，則應先用分色鏡，以分色干片攝成黄版紅版藍版黑版各一張，此種技術，明了干片，攝影冲曬者，即能爲之。</p>
<p>（二）將拍就之分以色底片，置於鏡頭前之放大架上，如放大法，用毛玻璃拍成黄深紅淡紅深藍淡藍黑灰七張濕片陽文底片，法與拍石印照相同，惟吃黑不用山奶銀粉，而用亞硫酸鈉之濃溶液，</p>
<p>（三）修毛玻璃用鉛筆與墨灰，凡熟塡三色彼或能畫石者，或習水彩畫銅筆畫墨炭畫成績良好者，學之極易。</p>
<p>（四）將修准顔色之毛玻璃陽文底片，置於放大架上，拍成網紋陰文底片，其法如拍照相銅版濕片一樣角度，如拍四色銅版，惟圖樣應拍得十分清楚。</p>
<p>（五）銅皮落樣，亦如鋅版，但因銅皮是毛的，感光藥水稍厚一點耳。</p>

<p>「阿有籠頭渣···」一個面黄肌瘦兩肩高聳的黑籍老叟，肩頭上背了一隻有攀的蒲包，脚上拖了一雙後跟派司的破鞋，没精打彩地在弄堂中徘徊着，嘴裏高唱着上面的口號，他的尊口，在發動呌喊的當兒，那兩片上下鼓盪的嘴唇皮上，可以看見他固有的特殊商標，！籠頭渣，較密司們的口紅，覺得還來得鮮艶奪目，這個非但是商標作用，也許是表示是他唯一的試騐貨品的天然機器，他爲了生活的驅使，和適應現代社會上黑籍中的下層階級者需要起見，所以來幹這椿三百六十行以外的一行。</p>
<p>他的口號，發出不多時，就聞得有人喊着「賣籠頭渣」，他聽了有生意到來，馬上三脚兩步地跑上去接洽。</p>
<p>「這包值多少錢」，一個烟客容面睠眼惺忪足上拖着繡花的拖鞋的少婦，這樣地問價，</p>
<p>老叟拿籠頭渣看了一看，再塞一些到那天然機器裏，試騐貨品的効力，鑒别的手續，完了，說道「兩百鈿阿賣」，　　「不·不·你不識貨，看看清爽，這個是大土的啊，你道歹貨嗎，｝我要賣，四百鈿，那哼，」</p>
<p>「啊唷！小生意小斯，差不來這麽大的，規規矩矩，添你五個罷」，</p>
<p>「起碼三百五，少一鈿，情願勿賣」少婦很堅决地說。</p>
<p>「頭一莊生意，勿算數，再加你三個好吧，」</p>
<p>「我是說過三百五，少一鈿勿賣·你不要，也勿礙」少婦說畢，向地上拿起籠頭渣，朝裏走」。</p>
<p>「唉！你們財主人，吃得起大土的，兩個銅板，倒看來介重，算我不賺，來·來·來·憑你三百五」，少婦聽見老叟答應她的要求，馬上笑嘻嘻地，掉轉身來，將一包籠頭渣，授給老叟，一邊也照數給了錢，雙方總算成就了一莊交易。</p>
<p>那老叟走出弄堂的時候，心中暗地想，這種人，眞個不懂，旣然這樣小算，那末幾千塊錢一兩的大土，吃牠怎甚，旣經那樣貴的大土，吃着不肉麻，那末，何必這兩個銅板，倒要算出性命來，難道兩個銅板，比幾千塊錢一兩的大土，來得貴重嗎，唉！這個眞呌·「寸緊尺寛丈勿算了」。</p>

<p>阿狗十二歲了，終日和鄰居小孩在牛車棚底下騎白馬滾銅鈿，阿狗的爺娘忙着田事，没有空功夫敎管他們的兒子。</p>
<p>一天，阿狗的寄娘來望他的爺娘，見阿狗比從前聰明伶俐，笑着對他說「我帶你上海去玩，好嗎？」小孩子當然歡喜得依着寄娘膝前不肯離去　　所說「上海去玩」並不是誑話，寄娘阿嬸的乾兒子，在上海開一爿成衣舖，寄娘得阿狗爺娘的許可，薦他到成衣舖裏做學徒。</p>
<p>起初幾天阿狗除了掃地，拭桌等瑣事外，空閒着看看上海的街景，却比東一條田隴，西一個牛棚，好玩得多，但是天氣漸漸的熱了，做學徒的没有床舖，在地板上打地舖，臭虫擾得他不能安睡，他的胖胖的四肢上，變成赤荳煶子了。</p>
<p>因爲做夏衣的時候生意好，店裏添了客帮師傅，阿狗早上又多了一項燒粥工作，師傅們工作時，吩咐他在旁邊拉風，他暗付進店以來這是最好的工作了，因爲燒粥時出過一身汗，燒中飯時又出一身汗，這樣一寒一熱，夏天過完，阿狗已瘦了許多。</p>
<p>師傅養了第二個兒子，阿狗像要人一樣，又兼職洗屎布，師傅娘飯後打麻將去，將小孩交付他，於是阿狗的工作比什麽人都忙了。</p>
<p>霎霎眼阿狗進店已將一年，艷雪紛飛的早晨，拿了籃去買小菜（這又是新兼的好差事）回來後泡開水，洗菜……四季不停的前進，阿狗的工作也增加無已。</p>
<p>新年裏阿狗的娘從鄉間出來看他，不由她一驚，阿狗會瘦了這許多，阿狗也哭着要回去，幸蒙師傅批准，榮歸故鄉。（那是指師傅送了兩元鞋襪錢）</p>
<p>阿狗又和鄰居的小孩在牛車棚底下騎白馬！做了一年裁縫學徒，他没有拿一回針和一根綫，所以阿狗至今不明白一匹布怎樣變成一件衣服的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">How to Save China's Economic Crisis <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Mu Ouchu published an article in this newspaper entitled "China's Economic Crisis." From the figures of export and import values, he pointed out the rapid economic aggression against China by industrially advanced countries. Furthermore, from the comparison of the types of imported goods, he pointed out that more than 90% of imported foreign goods are consumer goods, while machinery, which are production tools, only account for 3.38%. He recognizes this as a prominent symptom of China's economy, and a great crisis for China's economic future. Finally, he suggests removing production obstacles, curbing the import of foreign goods, and vigorously promoting domestic goods as the crucial steps to save the economic crisis, urging the Chinese people to work together to implement them. His words are earnest and thought-provoking. We would like to elaborate on the promotion of domestic goods and seek practical ways to implement it.</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, imperialists have used guns to break open our peaceful doors, and their industrial products have flooded in like a tide. Within our country, there are also merchants who only know how to profit and comprador who feed on the leftovers of others, willingly throwing themselves into the arms of foreign capitalists, serving as the vanguard and brokers of their economic aggression. High-priced, top-quality goods pour in, while cheap raw materials are exported. Between this outflow and inflow, our handicrafts are squeezed out, agriculture is oppressed, and the flesh and blood of our people are extracted daily. For the past hundred years, our country has been trapped in a miserable state of decay and decline. Now, the crisis is even more apparent and we are on our last breath. Looking at the categories of imported goods, we see that our clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all controlled by others. What could be more dangerous and terrifying than this? Looking ahead, it is truly chilling. As for the social aspect, in recent years, habits have become increasingly extravagant and customs have become increasingly vain. Even middle-class families will not wear clothes that are not foreign, nor will they enjoy food that is not foreign, and they will not use utensils that are not foreign. As for wealthy families and powerful figures, their children and wives do nothing but indulge in luxury and compete in extravagance. Their clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all foreign goods, and they only choose the most expensive items. Even male and female university students mostly only care about their appearance, wearing foreign clothes and using foreign goods. Other consumer goods, such as hair oil, face powder, soap, handkerchiefs, and cigarettes, all come from Paris, New York, London, and other places. People are proud to use foreign goods and ashamed to use domestic goods. People consider extravagance to be grand and frugality to be vulgar. The trend of extravagance, centered in the cities, gradually spreads to the interior. The influx of foreign goods also centers in the cities and gradually flows into poor and remote areas. As a result, no one cares about domestic goods, which are becoming increasingly weak, while foreign goods flood the markets and are growing more prosperous every day. Our national economy is heading towards a state of exhaustion.</p>
<p>Therefore, if our country wants to save its economic crisis today, promoting domestic goods is one of the most important things to do. To promote domestic goods, we must correct the extravagant atmosphere in cities and advocate frugality. We must correct the psychology of Chinese people who love to use foreign goods and advocate domestic goods. We must first seek domestic goods for clothing, food, housing, transportation, and all daily needs. We should not use foreign products unless absolutely necessary. This should start with one person and extend to a family, and from a family to society. Shanghai is the origin of extravagance and the largest market for foreign goods. If the atmosphere in Shanghai changes, it will have a widespread effect, and the interior will follow suit.</p>
<p>Furthermore, young students, who are the future masters of our country, must cultivate the habit of frugality and the psychology of loving domestic goods to lay the foundation for the future. We believe that after this year's summer vacation, the education authorities should strictly order all public and private schools across the country to absolutely prohibit male and female students from wearing foreign clothes and pursuing luxury. All supplies, except for essential educational supplies, must be domestic goods. Teachers must also lead by example. Students who do not comply will be refused admission. Furthermore, administrative and public officials and their families should also be subject to strict orders from the government to prohibit them from wearing foreign clothes and using foreign products, both to promote a spirit of thrift and to cultivate their morals. Those who do not comply will be severely punished or dismissed. If this is implemented for a long time, we dare to assert that it will surely have a significant and practical effect. If the political and educational authorities cannot use their power to supervise and implement this matter, then other political and educational reforms will be empty talk. We must not underestimate this matter as trivial. India's resistance to foreign cloth with domestic cloth is the best example for our country today.</p>
<p>Domestic industrialists and financiers must also broaden their horizons and not focus on small, immediate gains, nor worry about small, immediate losses. They must prioritize the welfare of the nation and use planned actions to seek the development of industry and work together to ensure the smooth progress. Only then can national industries prosper, domestic goods be sold smoothly, and the economic crisis be gradually saved. We will discuss the removal of production obstacles and the suppression of foreign goods imports in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Government Will Telegraph the Representative Stationed in Geneva…</p>
<p>For a Preliminary Talk With the Russian Representative</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to foreign sources, the Soviet Union is very indifferent to the Sino-Soviet resumption of relations negotiations. Not only has the non-aggression treaty not been discussed immediately, but even the Chinese delegation members' desire to meet with the Russian Diplomatic Committee has been delayed in setting a date, further showing that Japan and Russia have exchanged views, and we are lagging behind. The government believes that resuming relations with Russia is a fixed step, and if this route is blocked, other methods can be used. It is heard that the Geneva representative will be instructed by telegram to have a preliminary talk with the Russian representative attending the Disarmament Conference, who is nearby. Recently, many Chinese scholars have supported the Sino-Soviet resumption of relations, but no method has been researched on how to negotiate and from what route to proceed. The diplomatic authorities have already reported the reason for Russia's indifference this time, based on the report of the Russian delegation, the content of which does not seem appropriate to disclose at this time, but its outline should be known soon.

Henan will send a division, and Shandong will send the three brigades of Li Hanzhang, Chen Dexun, and Zhang Shulin. Hebei and Henan telegraphed Han to send someone to serve as the commander-in-chief of the three provinces' suppression of Liu, but Han replied that each province would send a senior official to command its own military forces to cooperate in the joint suppression. The commander-in-chief of the Shandong army is Sun Tongxuan, who currently resides in Guancheng. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han said that two American journalists came to visit and asked me if China still had internal strife and whether it was certain to suppress the communists. I answered that the whole country is united and working together to overcome national difficulties, and there will never be internal strife again. Since there is no internal strife, it is not difficult to suppress the communist bandits. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom once occupied more than one province, and Zeng and Hu, who were still scholars, were able to quell the great disaster. Now the communist bandits are only disturbing Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, Henan, and Anhui, and the central government's military force is a hundred times greater than Zeng and Hu's, so they will be able to quell it. Because the military force is sufficient, there will be no future transfer of the Shandong army, Liu Guitang is still in Shanpu and Puyang, and Hebei and Henan have both telegraphed to ask the military of this province to send troops across the border to assist in the suppression. Defenses have been deployed at all Yellow River ferry crossings, and Liu will not be able to fly over. North China is calm, and Zhang's resignation is purely a rumor fabricated by a certain country's newspaper. Furthermore, the provincial army pursuing Liu's troops has advanced to a place fifty li away from Puyang. (Sixteenth dispatch)</p>

Chu Minyi and representatives from various agencies welcomed him at the station. After disembarking, Lin immediately proceeded to his private residence in a government car for rest, and then visited the National Government for a week to handle official business. When interviewed by reporters, he mentioned that he had gone to Shanghai to persuade Minister of Communications Chen and Minister of Finance Song to stay in their positions. Chen had agreed to withdraw his resignation, but is temporarily unable to come to Nanjing due to illness. He will resume his duties as soon as he recovers. Song's situation is even less of a problem. Song's resignation was due to financial difficulties. If a proper solution can be found, he will definitely continue to take on the arduous task. At 2:30 PM, Lin traveled by car to Xiaguan and then took the Gonghe steamer to Xun to visit Chairman Chiang. Chu Minyi, Lü Chao, and others went to see him off. Lü Chao said that Chairman Lin's visit to Xun was to discuss important political matters such as diplomacy, military affairs, and finance with Chiang. (Special Dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Lin Sen returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 16th. Because it was necessary to consult with Chiang and Wang on the results of retaining Song and Chen in Shanghai, the progress of visiting Sun Ke, and important issues such as future diplomacy, finance, and military affairs, he took the Gonghe steamer to Xun at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. It is said that after Lin meets with Chiang and Wang, he will go from Xun to Han and then take the Pinghan Railway back to Luo. (Special Dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the eve of his departure, Lin Sen said that his trip to Shanghai was specifically to retain Song and Chen, and he met with them twice. Song said that his request to leave was actually due to the lack of financial solutions, and he requested the Executive Yuan to provide open-source strategies. He will never deliberately act passively in politics. Now that this matter has been substantially resolved, his resignation can be withdrawn. Chen firmly requested the Central Government to grant him an opportunity to recuperate, and his intention to resign is firmer. Wang has agreed to grant him leave for a few months. In short, during this time of national crisis, it is hoped that all gentlemen in politics will devote themselves to national affairs and exert themselves for the Party. All trivial issues can be abandoned. I am going to Xun today to visit Chiang to discuss everything. I do not want to stay in Kuling for too long and will return to Nanjing in a week.

In the past few months, the commissioners of customs and the custodian banks have been threatened by Japanese advisors of the puppet state, resulting in the failure to allocate all tax funds as usual. The principal and interest of the guaranteed foreign debts have been advanced by the General Customs Commissioner under the reserve. This matter is of great importance to the destruction of China's customs integrity and the rights of creditors of various countries.

<p>Swiss President Motta Delivers Welcome Speech; British Prime Minister MacDonald Elected Chairman Reuters, Lausanne, 16th The representatives of fourteen countries and four British dominions attended the reparations conference this morning. Three hundred reporters from various newspapers around the world have gathered here to report on the conference. The venue is located in the ballroom of the Beau-Rivage Palace Hotel, which has been specially equipped with green long tables and representative seats. Police were densely deployed around the venue and on various roads in the morning to maintain order. At 10:00 AM, the representatives gathered at the venue and the meeting was announced to be open. At 10:15 AM, Herriot rose to propose MacDonald as chairman. Asquith unexpectedly rose to second the motion, which was unanimously approved by the entire assembly. Swiss President Motta then took the stage to deliver a welcome speech.</p>
<p>Chairman Delivers Speech Next, Chairman MacDonald delivered a speech, stating that in the current crisis, there is no France, Italy, Germany, or America, nor is there Great Britain. Apart from the world, nothing else is worth mentioning. Apart from the current system that is collapsing under our feet, nothing else is worth considering. The current crisis is the most dangerous, and its harm to the peaceful world is unprecedented. Today, the eyes of the world are focused on Lausanne. Regarding international trade, it is probably less than half of what it was in 1929. The number of unemployed people is between twenty million and twenty-five million. The world's disasters are worsening day by day. In order to protect their finances, countries have successively implemented various restrictions to reject foreign goods. This is unavoidable in the short term, but it is also a strategy of drinking poison to quench thirst. It not only causes suffering to all people in the world, but also causes the legal and progressive organizations and psychology to be broken. This matter can only be successful with a global plan. Because no country can avoid the overall disaster, it is impossible to stay out of the recovery work. If here, as elsewhere, it proves that the policies we are implementing violate the simplest economic laws, then agile wisdom and common sense will surely force us to quickly change course and seek good policies, and be prepared to pay the temporary price required for changing course. I believe that if we have clear views and calm nerves, we will surely be able to accomplish this feat. MacDonald agreed with the opinion of the economic expert committee that reorganizing the debts between governments to suit the current state of the world is the only lasting step to restore trust. MacDonald continued to urge that matters be resolved quickly. An agreement reached quickly is a hundred times more beneficial than an agreement reached through long negotiations and painful compromises. The conference should not focus on technical details, but should focus on broad principles. The one principle presented to the assembly today is that a solemnly established constraint cannot be invalidated by a unilateral denial. MacDonald concluded by saying that he hoped that the assembly would not have any reservations and boldly put forward suggestions, and that those that are just and reasonable will surely receive the support of the world. Afterwards, the assembly elected Sir Hankey as Secretary-General, and then adjourned the meeting at 11:15 AM.</p>
<p>Discussing the Agenda An informal meeting will be held in the afternoon to discuss the agenda. Representatives of major powers have been invited to attend. Another plenary meeting will be held tomorrow, at which German Chancellor Papen will address the assembly. The general impression caused by MacDonald's speech is that any idea of immediately negotiating a complete cancellation of the debt agreement is out of the question. MacDonald predicted that this move would require lengthy negotiations before a compromise could be reached, so the result would likely be to extend the debt repayment period.</p>

<p>The New Cabinet's Attitude is the Same as the Old Cabinet National News, Lausanne, 15th Tonight, after the German delegation met with German and other foreign journalists, a pessimistic tone emerged again, greatly diminishing the optimistic hope expressed by Paris a few days ago. German Chancellor Papen bluntly stated that the German delegation will insist at all costs that Germany is unable to pay reparations at any time. The previous cabinet had already clearly stated this, and the new cabinet has no intention of abandoning this attitude today. Today, Europe and Germany are eagerly awaiting the politicians gathered in Lausanne to make a decision that will clear away the clouds and allow the status of Europe and the world to move a step forward. If the results of international conferences are often delayed and extended, it is truly intolerable. He also said that Germany will oppose all attempts to delay the resolution of this important issue.</p>

The so-called just must be based on what the environment permits. If concessions are made according to the environment, the dignity of the war debt contract can be maintained. He supports the opinion of the economist Sartre to find a solution that is slightly different from complete cancellation. The British proposal should be governed by two basic principles: (1) Germany should be asked to make a formal repayment after the necessary grace period, in order to acknowledge its obligations. However, this repayment should not place a heavier burden on modern Germans that they cannot shoulder. When Germany agrees to this repayment, all parties should shake hands with each other and make a statement that past mistakes will not be held against them. (2) Britain must be prepared to allow a larger amount than it receives from Germany to be paid to the United States. The plan should be moved from Lausanne to Washington. The representatives participating in the reparations conference should go to Washington to discuss with President Hoover and leading figures from the Republican and Democratic parties whether this plan is acceptable or whether there are any modifications.</p>

<p>Ma Zhanshan's Troops Divide and Guard Tongbai; Gong Changhai's Troops Advance to East of Harbin; Harbin-Suifenhe Traffic Completely Cut Off; Panic in Harbin – Harbin Correspondence – Ma Zhanshan led the Heilongjiang volunteer army and was forced to retreat to the Tongbei and Beianzhen areas. Li Haiqing, Li Tiande, and Cai Hongyou's troops concentrated towards Hailun and Wangkui. They originally planned to attack Hailun frontally after the troops converged, in order to contain the Japanese army's Hiraga Brigade. On the flank, cavalry would encircle Wangkui and take Suihua and Hulan in order to cut off the Japanese army's rear. However, this plan has not yet been successful, and the Japanese army has already contacted the Wang Zhenguo Brigade of the puppet Heilongjiang army and first occupied Wangkui, blocking the Black Army's retreat. Therefore, Ma Zhanshan changed his plan, concentrated his forces in Tongbei, and since the Japanese army's Amano Brigade in Heihe had advanced to Keshan, with the potential to obliquely exit Baichuan, the Black Army, fearing being pressured, transferred Cai Hongyou and Deng Wen's two brigades to Baichuan to jointly defend against the enemy on the Qiqihar-Keshan Road with Pu Datong's army. Wu Songlin, Li Haiqing, and Li Tiande were stationed between Hailun and Beianzhen, and cavalry guerrilla warfare was waged between Suihua and Wangkui. There have been skirmishes between sentries in Zhongtun and Qingxingzhen northwest of Wangkui for days, with casualties on both sides. The main force has not yet made contact. As for the Yang Zibin troops of the former Kirin army attacking Acheng, there was news that they would attack again, but due to Japanese reinforcements and the puppet Kirin army's strong defense, they turned to the Shuangcheng and Yushu areas. On the 9th, they cooperated with Zhang Dacheng's former Kirin army to capture Wuchang, and then immediately withdrew to Xiaoshanzi outside the city. A Japanese regiment cooperated with the puppet Kirin army to attack. Fighting has already begun. It is said that the Kirin army is supported by the Big Sword Society and has the upper hand. Three Japanese aircraft from Harbin flew there on the 10th to help attack. The outcome is not yet known. The eastbound passenger train used to run to Yimianpo once, and yesterday to Ashihe, but today (the 11th) it has been suspended. It is reported that the Ma Xianzhang and Yao Bingqian brigades of the former Kirin army bypassed Acheng and advanced to Cheng Gaozi Station, 50 li southeast of Harbin. The Hiramatsu Regiment of the Hirose Division of the Japanese army in Harbin, along with cavalry, set off early today to resist. Several aircraft also went to assist in the battle. The artillery fire was very fierce. The former Kirin army used cavalry to outflank, copied out the rear, and reached 25 li from the outskirts of Harbin, so there was quite a bit of panic in the city. It was also heard that Gong Changhai and Feng Zhanhai's 7,000 troops of the former Kirin army appeared on the evening of the 10th at Jinjia Wopeng, 60 li east of Harbin. In the evening, the Li Wenbing troops of the puppet Kirin army stationed in Harbin opened fire at Huangshanzui to block them. After 8 PM, artillery fire was heard faintly in the city. All entertainment venues were ordered to stop business at 9 PM every evening, and people were even more frightened for a while. Early today, most of the Japanese troops opened fire outside the eastern suburbs to support the puppet army and formally opened fire with Gong and Feng's troops. The battle was very fierce. The Japanese army in the port moved out and was deployed in the suburbs to inspect pedestrians returning from outside the city. The situation was very tense. The Japanese side learned that Gong Changhai had sent plainclothes teams to Harbin to prepare for activities, so the military police also moved out to search, and many people were arrested as suspects. It was heard that there was also fighting on the Harbin-Suifenhe line between Wujimi River and Hailin Station. The Big Sword Society of the former Kirin army and Wang Delin's National Salvation Army attacked Hailin and Wujimi River separately. Because the telegram was not working, the situation was unknown. The Japanese side is still planning to send two more divisions north, one division to be stationed long-term in Yilan, Jiamusi, Nandamen, etc. in the lower reaches of the Songhua River, and one division to open up the Harbin-Suifenhe line. The original 10th and 14th divisions will focus on dealing with Ma Zhanshan's army, and it is planned to launch a large-scale offensive against the volunteer armies when the green gauze tents have not yet risen (11th).</p>

<p>Chiang to Visit Nanchang, Hunan After Overall Plan is Decided – Nanchang Correspondence – After arriving in Lushan on the 9th from Xun, Chiang Kai-shek, along with He Yingqin and Xiong Shihui, in addition to studying the bandit suppression plan, often visited the scenic spots of Lushan in his free time, and telegraphed the military and political leaders of the five provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Henan to go to participate in the bandit suppression conference. He Chengjun, Xia Douyin, Chen Cheng, etc., all arrived in Xun on the 13th and transferred to Guling.</p>
<p>According to news from the headquarters of the three provinces, Chiang Kai-shek believes that the base areas of the various bandits, such as Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, He Long, Kuang Jixun, Kong Hechong, Fang Zhimin, and Li Mingrui, all cross the borders of several provinces, and they use complex and dangerous terrain to move around to suppress. The anti-communist troops in the past often had regional concepts and could not effectively contact each other, so the bandits were able to avoid the real and take the virtual, and harass them in a circular manner. Chiang Kai-shek's meeting with He Yingqin and the military and political leaders of various provinces in Lushan this time is to discuss the allocation and connection of the anti-communist troops in various provinces. He will go to Wuhan after the overall plan is decided. According to news from the provincial government, Secretary-General Liu received a telegram from Chairman Xiong yesterday, ordering him to transfer all the volumes of the provincial bandit suppression conference to Lushan to serve as a reference for the five-province anti-communist plan. The provincial government then dispatched Director Gong to take all the bandit suppression plans to Lushan for Chiang Kai-shek to review, and Gong will also take the plan to build provincial and county roads and the complete volume of the application to the central government for a loan of 20 million yuan to lay the three major railways of Jiangxi-Zhejiang, Jiangxi-Hunan, and Jiangxi-Guangdong, and ask Chiang Kai-shek to review and instruct.</p>

<p>Shang Zhen Sends a Large Team to Encircle and Suppress – Jinan Correspondence – The bandit troops of Liu Guitang and Guo Maofeng rebelled in Gaotang, and led their troops of about 3,000 people to flee west. Their purpose was to cross the Yellow River and still flee back to the Laogu Mountain of Baoduguo in southern Shandong to be bandits. However, all the Yellow River boats were gathered by the government on the south bank, and the bandits could not cross the river, so they fled west along the river and crossed the border from Chaocheng, Shandong Province, and entered Qingfeng Nanle, Hebei Province. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, then sent Sun Tongxuan, commander of the 20th Division, to supervise the 58th Brigade of Zhang Shulin and the 86th Brigade of Chen Dexin to follow and attack. Sun then transferred from Gaotang to Guancheng via Guanxian and Chaocheng, and is now stationed in Guancheng to supervise the suppression. According to a telegram received by the headquarters today, the Liu and Guo bandit troops suddenly fled to Puyang. The city could not resist, and yesterday (the 13th) the Liu bandit troops climbed into the city and occupied it. Many of the people in the city escaped. This place was originally the defense zone of Shang Zhen's troops. Shang has ordered the Gao Hongwen Brigade stationed in Daming to advance south from the north, and the Huang Brigade stationed in Daokou to advance to the northeast, and attack with all their strength. The Chen and Zhang brigades of Shandong will also advance west out of Shandong Province to go to Puyang and use the force of four brigades to suppress the bandits in order to annihilate them. The following is a copy of a telegram from the Magistrate of Chaocheng County, reporting the tragic situation of the Liu bandits passing through the border and burning and killing, as follows: On the evening of the 9th, more than a thousand members of the Liu bandit troops fled from Dali Village, Guanxian County, to Yangzhuang, Xiazhuang, and Dawangzhai in this county, and carried out large-scale burning and killing. According to reports, more than 40 people were killed, more than 10 people were seriously injured, and one woman was shot dead. On the 10th, they fled to Zhangluji and Zhaibei Xiaoying, Chengcun Chengzhuang of Daming County, Hebei Province, and Yulin, etc. of this county, and planned to occupy Bitun Mountain and provide food for 2,000 wealthy gentlemen in the area. Now, Division Commander Sun Tongxuan has led his army to Dali Village, only 60 li away from Bitun Mountain. It is expected that the bandits will not dare to stay there for long, but Bitun Mountain is only 25 li away from the county seat, so the County Magistrate and the Director of Public Safety led the government army and militia, etc., back to the city to defend.</p>
<p>Also, a part of the Zhang Heilian bandit troops who fled in Liangxiadian fled to Dabiangqiao in Sishui, and more than 100 people were killed by the Huang Regiment of the 22nd Division. The remaining bandits fled east to Huangshan Village in Mengyin. According to Yuan Jianmin, Director of the Public Safety Bureau of Sishui, more than 300 people of Zhang Heilian's troops occupied Chihuo Mountain in Sishui on the evening of the 10th, and looked like they wanted to go down from there. The militia has been sent to defend. On the 11th, the bandits traveled northeast along Qiushan, Yuhuang Mountain, and Shenggong Mountain, and are now temporarily stopping at Anjiayuzhuang, west of Pujiushan. The militia has been gathered to pursue and suppress them. Yuan Jianmin, Director of the Public Safety Bureau, is responsible for the security of the city gate. (14th)</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Industrial Department is Studying and Preparing to Implement – Our country is inherently on the silver standard, and all budgets and final accounts are in yuan, but stores and money shops often habitually calculate in taels. Small businesses and farmers inevitably suffer too much loss between income and expenditure. In fact, yuan is the substance, and tael is the imaginary unit. If this malpractice is not eliminated, the suffering of farmers and merchants will be difficult to alleviate. The Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce has submitted a separate report to the Ministry of Industry and the Industrial Department, requesting that an order be issued to abolish the use of tael and yuan in order to unify the currency system, and stating three points: (1) If the political situation can be stable, the implementation can be unimpeded; (2) After the implementation, silver and money businesses can reduce staff and save expenses; (3) It can avoid the trouble of remittance and transfer. It is heard that the Jiangsu Industrial Department finds the report very insightful and is conducting a thorough study in accordance with the currency system law, and plans to implement the uniform use of yuan, with the aim of complying with the law.

<p>The Wuxian County Government was ordered to collect two months' rent in urban and rural areas to offset the provincial expenses. After County Magistrate Zou was ordered, he repeatedly convened local people to discuss the matter, and the Finance Bureau sent personnel to collect it.

The Landlords' Improvement Association, organized by the landlords here, is adamantly opposed to this matter. In addition to submitting a report to the province to express their opposition, they also filed an impeachment with the Censorate.</p>

<p>Petition to Exempt義圖 Additional Tax: Chen Chuande, the magistrate of this county, previously received an order from the Finance Department of the Provincial Government, ordering the promotion of 義圖 and setting a deadline for completion. This matter was forwarded to the Finance Bureau for diligent handling. It was also ordered that, according to Article 11 of the revised 義圖 regulations, 3% should be extracted from the local surtax as 義圖 funding. This expenditure should be included in the budget. The county's financial affairs office was instructed to include this expenditure in the county's local budget for the 21st year. Now, Chen Zuolin, director of the financial affairs office, and others have submitted a report stating that local surtaxes are mainly used for civil administration and education, accounting for about 80%, while construction, agriculture, forestry, and rural autonomy account for about 20%. Under civil administration, public safety and police salaries take up the majority. Currently, civil administration expenses are already in debt of over 30,000 yuan due to monthly advances for public safety and police salaries. In education, in addition to the debt of over 44,000 yuan from last year, since February of this year, only 60% of education expenses have been paid in the whole county, and the remaining 40% will require another 50,000 yuan by the end of the month. In construction, the Xiyi Road alone has a debt of over 20,000 yuan, and even after completion, there will still be a shortfall of over 20,000 yuan. The bureau's operating expenses will have no source next month. If another 3% is extracted for 義圖 funding, the annual civil administration and education expenses will be short by another 17,000 to 18,000 yuan. Therefore, it is impossible to allocate this 義圖 additional tax. Yesterday, Magistrate Chen forwarded the situation to the Provincial Finance Department, requesting permission to exempt the levy to maintain local affairs.</p>
<p>Armed Police Intercept Gambling Offenders: In Nanshuang Temple, the 15th district of the county, gambling is rampant. The other day, Chen Siyu, the director of the local public security sub-bureau, sent patrolman Qian Shixiong to investigate gambling in Xu Xinggen's teahouse. Four gamblers, playing cards,麻省牌, and mahjong were arrested on the spot. However, on the way to the bureau, they were intercepted by armed county police officers and taken away. Yesterday, Director Chen reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation. Director Hua, upon receiving the report, has forwarded it to the county government.</p>
<p>Defense Chief Captures Rice Robbers: Mi Meiji, the head of the Anzhen Defense Group in the 8th district of the county, received a tip that villagers Chen Apan and others were colluding with bandits to rob rice. He immediately dispatched group members to Zou Lane, north of Anzhen, and arrested Chen Apan and An Ahu. They confessed to robbing rice in Hengtang Tomb Mound in the 9th district, as well as Jing Gaoshan and Lin'an in Baojia裏堠 Mountain in Anzhen. They also confessed that the kidnapping case of Li Gengfu's son, Gengnan, from Beizhai, was led by Pu Gengsheng and Tao Axiao, who have already been arrested. Yesterday, they were all sent to the city for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Wangzhuang Township Office Smashed: Wangzhuang Township, the 5th district of the county, has always had large sums of public funds for road repairs, fire extinguishing, and other purposes. Every year, at the end of the silkworm season, the villagers would pool their funds for a communal feast to collect the principal and interest for these projects. The other day, they held the event as usual. However, Yin Axiang, Mao Shunjin, Yang Rongting, Xu Yigen, Sun Rongjin, and Wu Afeng claimed that the township chief, Lu Shengrong, and Pu Yuxian were managing the funds unfairly, with no accounts being made public and excessive collection of public shares. A conflict ensued, resulting in the destruction of the township office's belongings. Lu Shengrong and Pu Yuxian reported to the 10th sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau, and Yin Axiang and others were arrested and taken to the bureau. After questioning, their statements were contradictory, so they were all sent to the county for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>County Government Executes Three Bandits: Qu Wu, a notorious bandit from Baipu, and Hou Zifu, the leader of bandits from Quanyuxi, were arrested by the police and sent to the county government for interrogation. They both confessed without denial. Magistrate Zhang submitted the case to the provincial government for review, and on the 15th, a telegram was received approving the death penalty. At 3 PM, the three bandits were escorted to Yaoma Road outside the city and executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Zhang's Property Contributed to Public Distribution: Zhang Fa, a local, entrusted Zhu Qinglan to distribute his confiscated property returned by the province to public welfare projects in the province and county. Zhu wrote to the county government, stating that Zhang Tuaian's returned property was originally intended for 40% to be used for local public welfare in Nantong and 60% for provincial disaster relief. According to the list provided by Zhang, a portion has been deducted for previous debts, leaving a total of 230,000 yuan. This plan, as stated by Zhang and planned by Nantong, is appropriate. Therefore, the funds should be evenly distributed, with half going to disaster relief and half to Nantong.</p>

<p>Bandit Leader Arrested in Zhenjiang and Sent to Gaoyou: Zhu Yingzhang (Zhu Xichun), a notorious bandit leader from the northeast of the county, was arrested in Zhenjiang for a drug case. The county government learned of this and, due to the bandit's numerous crimes in Gaoyou, sent police captain Wang Qilin with a team to escort him back. He was brought back to Gaoyou last night (the 13th) and sent to the county for interrogation. Judge Zhang opened the court and conducted a brief interrogation, ordering him to be imprisoned first.</p>

<p>Kidnapping Suspects Sent to Court: The homes of Feng Jiande and Feng Zuoqing in Xuejiagang, Jiaxing, were robbed, and Zuoqing's granddaughter-in-law, Wu, was kidnapped. It has been almost a month, and there is still no news. Subsequently, the Water Police Department arrested a suspect, Pan Asan. After interrogation, he confessed that the hostage was hidden in Yang Wenbiao's hut. They went to search, but did not find the hostage. Yang Wenbiao was detained, and although he was interrogated severely, he did not reveal the true location of the hostage. Later, two more suspects, Feng Yinong and Feng Baobao (Yinong's sister), were arrested. The interrogation was also fruitless. Yang Wenbiao's family petitioned the court, claiming injustice, and the prosecutor's office sent a letter to the Water Police Department for inquiries. It is now known that the Water Police Department yesterday sent the kidnapping suspects Feng Yinong, Feng Baobao, Pan Asan, and Yang Wenbiao, along with their confessions, to the prosecutor's office for investigation.</p>
<p>Water Police Detectives Illegally Search Civilian Homes: Lu Erguan, a farmer in Puguang Township, Jiaxing, had his home illegally searched by Shen Qiyuan, a detective from the 6th squad of the 6th team of the Water Police. The township government reported this and sent the officer, along with his credentials, to the 6th District Public Office for verification. However, the detective took the opportunity to escape. The squad leader covered up for the detective, claiming private grievances, and continued to illegally arrest Lu Erguan, falsely claiming that the detective was missing. He also retrieved the credentials from the District Public Office to destroy evidence. The township government has filed a complaint with the Water Police Department. After receiving the report, District Chief Zhou ordered the squad leader and the detective to report to the district for interrogation to warn against illegal activities and ensure peace.</p>

<p>Student National Salvation Association Investigates Donations: The Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association originally scheduled a donation investigation committee for the 11th, but it was adjourned twice. On the 13th, at 2 PM, a meeting was held at the Party headquarters. More than 20 representatives attended, with Xu Chengxian as chairman. They discussed the use of previous donations. The representatives had differing opinions. A vote was taken, and it was decided to create a National Humiliation Memorial Room. It was also passed to notify all schools in the name of the representative assembly to submit donation records for review within this week. The meeting then adjourned.</p>
<p>Jiangyun and Zhang Ting Order Dike Repair: The water level of the canal has been rising continuously in recent days. The water mark at the Sangu Gate in Jiangdu Xun reached 9 feet 9 inches on the 14th, an increase of 5 inches compared to last week. The Jiangdu County government received a telegram from the Construction Department, stating that due to irregular weather and increased rainfall after summer, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has risen sharply, gradually affecting the farmland and water conservancy of various counties in the province. The dikes of the rivers and weirs in each county are a barrier to protect farmland. If they are not quickly repaired and strengthened, the flood season will arrive soon, and the water level will rise, causing concern. The county magistrate is hereby ordered to immediately supervise the director of the Construction Bureau to thoroughly inspect the weirs and dikes within the county, strengthen them, and ensure their integrity. Special attention should be paid to reinforcing the most important areas.</p>

<p>Recent Situation of Three Detained County Magistrates: Hong Fuyuan, the magistrate of Funing County, who was detained in the Public Security Bureau by the Civil Affairs Department, has been in detention for a long time, and his nerves have been severely stimulated. Last night, Hong suddenly acted abnormally, shouting about injustice. The Public Security Bureau believed that Hong was suffering from an epidemic, so Section Chief Tang of the Health Section injected him with a preventive vaccine, and he regained his senses. Today, he is acting as usual. However, it is rumored that Hong had tried to commit suicide by jumping into a well, but was rescued by the guards in the bureau. When asked, people in the bureau denied the incident. As for Hua Zhen, the magistrate of Xinghua County, and Peng Guoyan, the magistrate of Pi County, although they have been interrogated once, the provincial government stated that it is still sending people to various counties to investigate evidence. It has not yet been decided whether to send them to court or to be handled by the provincial government.</p>
<p>Residents of Xinlu Oppose Curved Route: Residents of Xinma Road from Luzhou Guild Hall to the Plaza are protesting against the Construction Department's decision to use a curved route instead of a straight line for that section of the road. This not only requires demolishing more civilian houses but also is not in line with modern road designs. They have jointly submitted a petition to the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Construction Department, requesting a redesign with a straight line. Last night, representatives Tu Guozhen and Hou Youcai were elected by the shop owners to report to the provincial press in Pinfang the lack of justification for the Construction Department's decision to build a curved road instead of a straight line, asking the media to uphold justice.</p>

<p>Wanted Agricultural Association Cadres: Mao Qiaqing and Wang Weishan, cadres of the Xiaoshan Farmers' Association, previously levied membership fees and forced farmers to pay estimation fees for the amount of land harvested. Farmers jointly accused them to the provincial and county governments and judicial organs. The provincial and county governments sent personnel to investigate and found the accusations to be true. The case was transferred to the county court for detention and interrogation. Unexpectedly, Mao and others fled upon hearing the news. Yesterday, the county court sent a letter to the county government, ordering all public security bureaus to issue wanted notices to arrest them for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Gu Weijun Changes Flight to Tomorrow <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Meeting with the Press Yesterday Afternoon: A Banquet Hosted by the Business Community Today. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations Inquiry Commission, arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday morning, he visited relatives and friends and Chen Mingshu, Minister of Transportation. At 3:30 PM, he met with the press at the Bankers Club. At 4:30 PM, he attended a tea party at the National Crisis Relief Association. At 5:30 PM, he attended a tea party hosted by the Local Association. At 7:30 PM, he gave a public lecture at the YMCA. Gu was scheduled to go to Beijing today, but due to unfinished business in Shanghai, he has postponed it for one day and will take the Ford aircraft to Beijing and then to Peiping tomorrow morning. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Morning Activities: Yuan left at 7:30 AM yesterday to visit relatives and friends. At 10:00 AM, he went to Yipinxian to visit Wang Shuhan, Secretary-General of the Peiping Pacification Headquarters, and had a lively conversation. At 11:30 AM, Gu went to Shanzhong Road to visit Chen Mingshu, Minister of Transportation, and returned home at 12:30 PM.</p>
<p>Reception for the Press: Zhang Xianglin, director of the Shanghai office of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations Inquiry Commission, hosted a reception for the press at the Bankers Club yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM to meet with Dr. Gu Weijun. About 20 people attended, including Chen Binhe, Pan Gongbi, Pan Gongzhan, Guan Jian, and Zhu Yingpeng. Zhang introduced Gu to the attendees, and then Gu gave a speech, saying: "I left Shanghai in mid-March and have been gone for three months. In these three months, I have had many feelings and don't know where to start. The delegation accompanied the Inquiry Commission out of the customs, from</p>

<p>Shanhaiguan in the west to Jilin in the east, Dalian in the south to Harbin in the north. What I heard and saw left a deep impression, and I felt the great importance of the relationship between Guan Nei and Guan Wai even more. I arrived in Shanghai yesterday and received a warm welcome from all parties, which I don't deserve. Although the delegation encountered many difficulties and dangers when accompanying the Inquiry Commission out of the customs, it was my duty to the country. Although the delegation members suffered greatly in the seven weeks, it was gratifying to be able to make the Inquiry Commission understand the situation in the East. The 30 million people in the Northeast have been in dire straits since September 18, and their suffering is endless. I hope that all parties will use the spirit of comforting the delegation to comfort the 30 million people in the Northeast, so that their spirits can be a little happier and more excited. At present, the compatriots in the East are full of sorrow and cannot tell. Intellectuals have no freedom of assembly, speech, or publication under the oppression of the Japanese. Even gatherings for talks are subject to Japanese interference. For merchants, the current commerce in the East is extremely depressed, but merchants cannot close their doors and are constantly notified by the pseudo-police厅, asking them to hang the pseudo-national flag today and the Japanese flag tomorrow. They want to resist but cannot, which is especially painful. As for farmers, the areas near the Northeast Railway and major transportation routes are forbidden to grow sorghum. The land currently planted is less than 40%, and the harvest will certainly not exceed this number. The food for the compatriots in the East next year is still unknown. This situation is the same in all areas of the Northeast occupied by the Japanese. The Inquiry Commission's investigation work has been completed, and it is now organizing the materials obtained and exchanging views with both China and Japan in preparation for compiling a report. The delegation's previous work was to assist in the investigation and collect materials. The subsequent work is to assist the Inquiry Commission in researching the materials obtained and convey the government's opinions so that the Inquiry Commission can</p>
<p>adopt them as much as possible. When we left Guan Nei, we felt that the national spirit of the whole country was extremely激昂, but now it is gradually declining. Looking back at the Japanese, they are expressing everywhere that the East cannot be abandoned. This is the biggest crisis in our country at present. I still hope that the government and the people will work together to avoid the permanent loss of the Northeast to foreign hands. In short, if our country wants to recover the Northeast, we must consider our own strength and not rely solely on the help of others. This is one of my humble opinions bought in Beijing and Xun. The results of the 山会议 unanimously advocated concentrating the strength of the whole country, doing everything possible, and actively recovering the Northeast to break the current crisis."</p>
<p>Newspaper Agency said, Gu also said, "In addition, there is one thing I must state to you, that is, the cooperative spirit of Japanese newspaper reporters and various Japanese military and political circles is something we have to admire. The Japanese organization is meticulous, and we have seen their traces everywhere we have been. Their work is not only about interviewing for news, but also combines the experience of偵探 and surveillance. I have gone out for a walk alone several times. I did not ask to send people to protect me in advance, nor did I announce the time, but the newspaper reporters used taking pictures as an excuse to delay the time to wait for Japanese secret agents or watchers to arrive. On another occasion, at the Changchun railway station, when I set off for the station, I only accompanied one secretary, and my so-called bodyguards were not present. A reporter followed me and talked, while another reporter went to report to the police station. Even when we were having tea and meals, Japanese reporters often probed for news for their military and political authorities when offering opinions or inquiring about news. Japanese reporters often expressed an opinion, which later became a reality. This is how it is even in Chinese territory, and it is even more imaginable in Japan. Their organization of rumors is also very complete. They would go ahead to make arrangements before the Inquiry Commission arrived at a place. For example, before the Inquiry Commission arrived in Harbin, all the newspapers in Harbin, including English, Russian, and Japanese newspapers, uniformly and to the greatest extent disclosed the things that the Inquiry Commission intended to investigate and also what they wanted to promote to people on the front page. Therefore, when the Inquiry Commission arrived in Harbin, it was already visible. This is something we can pay close attention to." After Gu's report, reporters asked about the Soviet Union's plans to exchange consular posts with the puppet state. According to him, it has been decided to establish puppet state consulates in Vladivostok, Khabarovsk, Heihe, and Chita. At the same time, the Russian side also allowed Japanese people to serve as vice consuls.</p>
<p>China News Agency Comfort: At 4 PM yesterday, the National Crisis Relief Association held a reception at the China News Agency on Weihaiwei Road to comfort Gu Weijun. More than 50 people attended, including Chu Fucheng, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Yaozeng, Shen Junru, Wang Zao, Zuo Shunsheng, Xu Fulin, Sun Hongyi, Xu Kecheng, Shen Sucun, and Xiong Xiling. At 4:30 PM, Gu arrived to applause and shook hands with everyone. First, Xiong Xiling delivered a comforting speech, saying, "It is a great honor for us to have Dr. Gu Weijun, who has worked hard for the country, come to the meeting in his busy schedule and give us a detailed report on the situation in the East. Dr. Gu's reputation in diplomacy needs no further introduction. We are very grateful to be able to learn about the government's attitude towards the loss of the three northeastern provinces and the actual situation in the three northeastern provinces after listening to Dr. Gu's speech." After Xiong's introduction, Gu stood up and said, "I am very uneasy to receive such a warm welcome from you today. I am very grateful for your telegram of condolences the other day. Three months ago, when I left Shanghai, I received earnest guidance from you. Today, we are still able to gather together, which is beyond my expectations. Regarding the situation in the East, the newspapers have repeatedly published talks. Today, I will only contribute one or two points. The delegation's trip to the East was extremely painful. Now that we have achieved satisfactory results and completed our mission, we are fortunate in the midst of sorrow. It is my duty to serve the country, but after this trip, I feel that I am constantly subjected to Japanese oppression and pain. This kind of pain is also beyond our expectations, and it is also beyond the expectations of the members of the Inquiry Commission. What I feel most deeply is that our country's current position is too far away from the international position. Although I and the members of the delegation tried our best to argue, the facts are obvious. Comparing the situation in Guan Nei with the facts in Guan Wai, we can clearly know that when arguing with the members of the delegation, I often feel that the neighbors in this 20th century are purely using scientific and thorough methods of aggression, and their fantasy of wiping out the Chinese army in three months is very stimulating to me. Now the Japanese have completely reformed the face of all the textbooks in the schools in the East, so that students can sing the Manchurian national anthem. All the railways in the East are operated by the South Manchurian Railway, and the Chinese government can naturally not interfere. However, the people in the East are struggling in this dire straits, and the resistance is very fierce. The people and people's organizations, as well as the Volunteer Army, are fighting against the invaders, which is very commendable. Foreigners often laugh at our country as an unorganized country. In our current state, we can only swallow our anger. Recalling the fact that the will of the people and the government in the country is still unable to cooperate, this is the most painful thing. In the 20th century, the people and the government must have a spirit of mutual sacrifice before the country can enter a respectable position, otherwise the future is unimaginable. Now the East is completely lost in a few months, which is a great hidden worry for the future of China. We must always find a way to recover the three northeastern provinces, because the East is the gateway to China. If China wants to survive, we must save ourselves. The most important thing today is that we must not think that the League of Nations will save our country. We must rely on our own efforts. Organizations such as the National Crisis Relief Association are a wonderful expression of the people's group saving the country." After Gu finished speaking, the chairman gave a thank-you speech. At 5:20 PM, Gu left first.</p>

<p>Six O'Clock Tea Party: The Local Association also contacted various groups yesterday afternoon at 5 PM to hold a tea party to comfort Gu at the association. More than 50 people attended, including community leaders Lin Lianhou, Guo Bingwen, and Xu Ji. After Gu arrived at the association at 5:25 PM, Shi Liangcai first gave an introductory speech and a comforting speech, followed by Gu standing up to thank the guests and earnestly reporting on his trip to the Northeast and the current situation in the Northeast, the suffering of the people. All the guests present expressed悲愤. The meeting adjourned at 7 PM.</p>
<p>Departure Postponed: After the tea party at the Local Association, Gu went to the banquet hosted by Zhang Xianglin at the Bankers Club. At 7 PM, he gave a public lecture at the YMCA in Bixianqiao. Gu was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing today, but due to unfinished tasks in Shanghai, he decided to postpone it for one day and will still take Zhang Xueliang's Ford aircraft to Beijing tomorrow morning. Wang Xiaolai, Qian Yongming, Xu Xinliu, Li Ming, and Xu Ji invited Gu and the remaining members of the delegation in Shanghai to a banquet at the Bankers Club at noon today to express their welcome and condolences.</p>
<h3 id="e115">This Morning's Takeover of Areas East of the Songhu Road <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Takeover Committee Appoints Huang Ming and Others to be Responsible. The Public Security Bureau Seeks to Restore All Districts. The area west of the Shajing Port, east of the Songhu Road, and north of the Old Rifle Range Road in the International Settlement, namely the jurisdiction of the five districts of Zhabei, which the Japanese side had agreed to withdraw from the day before yesterday, was inspected by the Takeover Committee yesterday in conjunction with the Public Security Bureau. They departed at 9:00 AM and finished at 11:30 AM, agreeing with the Japanese side that both parties would hand over at 10:00 AM this morning. The Takeover Committee has decided to go to receive the area on time this morning. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Inspection Situation At 9:00 AM, inspectors Huang Ming, Gong Xikui, He Yiming, Niu Jijian, Ju Jing, Bao Ju, Jin Gong, Cha Nanqiang, Liang Fuchu, Yin Tixin, Li Shengjun, Xie Zhidao, Jiang Shicheng, and more than ten others gathered at the Joint Association.</p>
<p>At 9:15 AM, they went directly to the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Headquarters on North Sichuan Road and Huang Lu Road, where they stopped the car. Gong Xikui, Huang Ming, Yin Tixin, and Jin Gong entered first to negotiate with Japanese Colonel Shima and Staff Officer Sugita. First, they compared the maps and designated the area. Then, Kojima dispatched Naval Lieutenant Junior Grade Kesaizo Sakabi and Yuo Oharada, carrying maps to lead the way. They first went to inspect the intersection of Dongbaoxing Road and the railway. There were four Japanese soldiers on sentry duty, and the sandbags on both sides had not yet been removed. They then went to the headquarters of the 3rd Platoon of the 5th Company of the 3rd Battalion of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces at Qifeng Public School on Guangdong Street. After a brief rest, they went to inspect the Qiujiang Road intersection, where there were also four Japanese sentries on duty. They then drove around Laobazi Road, Wusong Road, Tissot Road, Tiantong Road, and East Jiaotong Road for a week, and got out of the car at Xiangyan Bridge to inspect the boundary line. From there, they turned onto Xiangyan Road and Tissot Road, eastwards, to Shajing Port Bridge, for a week of inspection. Afterwards, they turned back from Tissot Road and drove to the intersection of Baole'an Road and Yokohama Road for inspection. According to Yuo Oharada's explanation to Huang Ming, there was a Japanese girls' school and a Japanese military recreation ground on Baole'an Road. At the same time, he said that the most Japanese residents lived on the left and right sides of the road, and requested that more posts be assigned after the takeover to give them special protection. The inspection was completed at 11:30 AM, and they returned together. In the afternoon, the Public Security Bureau, because the addresses of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd sub-bureaus of the Fifth District had been destroyed by fire, dispatched personnel to find other houses as temporary office locations.</p>
<p>What Was Seen Along the Way During the inspection, it was seen that the residents had all moved back, and it was very lively. However, because the administrative power had not been recovered for three months, no one had cleaned up along the way, resulting in garbage all over the streets and a foul odor. The worst areas were East Jiaotong Road, Tiantong Road, and Xiangyan Bridge. Vegetable stalls and vendors were randomly arranged along the way. When the car passed, swarms of flies flew up. The water in the Shajing River was dyed black. According to Jiang Shicheng, an inspector from the Health Bureau, during the week of inspection, the total amount of garbage in various places was about a hundred loads. He said that he would send people to clean up tomorrow and try his best to disinfect. The Wonton boats in the Shajing River must also be banned, because the epidemic, such as cholera, was expected to appear two months earlier than in previous years. On the one hand, it was related to the evil atmosphere after the war, and on the other hand, it was due to the failure to clean the streets in the war zone. Therefore, the health campaign this year was planned to start earlier, and special attention would be paid.</p>
<p>Today's Takeover The personnel for today's takeover were designated at the preparatory meeting of the Takeover Committee the day before yesterday. The distribution is as follows: (1) Huang Ming is responsible for the takeover, assisted by Gong Xikui, He Yiming, Ju Jing, Niu Jingjian, Wu Tingxun, Bao Ju, etc. (2) To facilitate direct consultation, special commissioners Xie Zhidao and Liang Fuchu will go to the Fifth District, Huo Shi will go to the First Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District, and Li Shengjun will go to the Second Sub-Bureau of the Fifth District to assist the heads of each district and bureau in the following tasks after the takeover: (1) Investigate the household registration; (2) Patrol and post sentries beyond the boundary; (3) Determine the posts; (4) Fire prevention matters; (5) The Fourth Squadron of the Beiping Security Team will be responsible for security.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting Yesterday at 4:00 PM, the Takeover Committee reconvened all relevant agencies to hold a meeting. Those present included Yin Rugeng, Chairman of the Takeover Committee, Special Commissioners Liu Yumen and Wu Hong, Cha Nanqiang, Tao Fengshan of the Telegraph Bureau, Huang Xiuqing of the Telephone Bureau, Jing Song of the Land Bureau, Gu Zhenbai of the Public Utilities Bureau, Liang Sicheng of the Finance Bureau, Huang Heng of the Public Works Bureau, Sun Yongyi of the Social Affairs Bureau, Jiang Shicheng of the Health Bureau, Zhou Shang of the Education Bureau, and Wang Binyan of the Defense Corps. The meeting was chaired by Yin and adjourned at around 5:00 PM. Matters resolved: (1) The Dongbaoxing Road branch of the telephone will be repaired starting today, and at the same time, telephone communication will be restored to the district offices first to maintain security. Other telephones will be repaired as work continues. (2) The telegraph line has been repaired to Zhang Huabang, and it will be unobstructed within two or three days. (3) The Defense Corps will</p>

<p>be convened immediately after today's takeover and will restore its original state immediately. (4) Some of the streetlights of the Public Utilities Bureau are still intact, and those that are damaged will be sent for repair today. (5) The garbage in the area is piled up like a mountain, and the water in the Shajing Port River is also abnormally polluted. The Wonton boats have also gathered there. It was decided that the Health Bureau will first send forty people to remove the garbage.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Bomb Found Near Chen Mingshu's Residence <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Found Early, Fortunately No One Was Injured Yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, a hand grenade was suddenly discovered next to the bamboo fence in the garden of the residence of Chen Mingshu, Minister of Transportation, at No. 75 Shanzhong Road, French Concession. Fortunately, it was discovered early and did not explode. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Found by Street Sweeper After Chen presented his resignation to the central government, he immediately came to Shanghai resolutely and resided at his residence at No. 75 Shanzhong Road, French Concession, to show his determination and to live in seclusion for recuperation. However, yesterday at around 6:00 AM, a street sweeper was sprinkling water near Chen's residence when he suddenly discovered a hand grenade next to the bamboo fence in the small pavilion in front of the house in the garden.</p>
<p>Detective Investigation The street sweeper, in a panic, immediately reported to Chen's residence and forwarded the report to the Shanzhong Road police station. The police chief, upon hearing the news, immediately sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. It was observed that the grenade was oval-shaped, with several turns of threads in the middle and a short rope tied to the upper end. It was completely old-fashioned. However, at a distance of only a foot away from the grenade, there were several pieces of exploded grenade shell. Fortunately, it was discovered early and did not cause an accident. The French police from the police station took the grenade away and temporarily stored it in the police station for investigation.</p>
<p>Important People Offer Condolences After the news spread, important people in this port went to inquire one after another. Mayor Wu Tiecheng was the first to arrive. Dr. Gu Weijun also heard the news and went to Chen's residence to offer condolences from 11:00 AM. Chen dismissed it with a smile. At 12:30 PM, Gu and Mayor Wu left together.</p>

<h3 id="e120">The Labor Unrest at the International Settlement Telephone Company is Becoming Serious <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Police Strictly Prevent Workers from Sabotage</p>
<p>Workers Hold Another Congress of Representatives</p>
<p>The strike by workers at the International Settlement Telephone Company has become increasingly serious since the breakdown of negotiations. The police are also very strict in their prevention measures. The strike committee held a congress of representatives yesterday, and worker leader Yao Yuesheng was beaten again. Although the automatic telephone exchange is still operating normally, the sound is low and turbid. The various situations are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Increased Prevention Since the breakdown of negotiations, the Public Concession police, at the request of the company, fearing that the striking workers would sabotage the automatic telephone exchange, have increased the number of Chinese and Western armed detectives stationed at the entrances of the Central Bank on Jiangxi Road, the New Central Bank on Fujian Road, the North Branch on Haining Road, the Branch on Metherst Road, the South French Branch on Bisson Road, the New South French Branch on Minte Nyong Road, the East Branch on Jushan Road, the Road Sheng Branch on Yidingpan Road, and the Yangshupu Repair Shop. Prevention has been increased, and strangers are prohibited from entering and leaving. Senior Chinese staff members of the company are also interrogated.</p>
<p>Forced Communication The company has completely rejected the conditions put forward by the strike committee and does not recognize the strike committee. It only allows the workers to return to work unconditionally and asks the police to protect them to prevent the workers from stopping the communication. However, because the strike has lasted for nine days and the weather is humid, the workers in the automatic exchange test lines, motor room, ground lines, (blank) lines, air ducts, and aerial lines have mostly joined the strike. For example, when the workers change shifts at 8:00 AM, 5:00 PM, and 12:00 midnight, they must test the automatic exchange for damage. It is now necessary to reduce the number of tests, so the sound of the communication is not very clear and is slow. However, the company is trying its best to restore the situation.</p>
<p>Worker Leader Beaten Yesterday morning, Yao Yuesheng, the Chinese worker leader of the new installation room on Fujian Road, informed the workers in the new installation room that the company had accepted the basic conditions put forward by the strike committee and hoped that they would return to work at the company as soon as possible. As a result, more than 200 workers went to the company together at 10:00 AM to prepare to return to work. Later, they did not see the worker leader. When they asked engineer Wilson, they learned that it was not true. At 11:00 AM, they all withdrew and met the worker leader near Qingliange on Hubei Road. They questioned him and beat him, but fortunately he was not injured.</p>
<p>Attitude of Worker Leaders A reporter from the New Voice Society asked the worker leaders about their attitude towards the strike yesterday at No. 113 Yuan Shu, according to them, all the workers are on strike because they cannot bear the oppression of the imperialist capitalists. The worker leaders are in the same position and should act in unison and never break the strike discipline. They have no prejudice against the strike committee and are very sincere in cooperating and fighting against the capitalists. The strike committee's actions towards the worker leaders this time are a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Congress of Representatives The Jiangxi Road head office and various branches held separate meetings the day before yesterday and elected new representatives to participate in the work of the strike committee. Yesterday morning, they reported to the Tongshang Hotel. The strike committee held a congress of all representatives at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to deal with the company. It is heard that (1) they will insist on continuing the strike to seek the final victory; (2) each district and team will start a fundraising team to raise strike funds from all walks of life; (3) those who violate the strike discipline will be handed over to the strike court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Increased Telephone Prices in the Concession <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Business Increase of 34.6 Percent</p>
<p>Other Increase of 25 Percent</p>
<p>Effective March 27 of This Year</p>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau's Information Office released a message stating that at the Board of Directors meeting on Wednesday of this week, the board had approved the Telephone Company's request to increase telephone prices in accordance with Article 13 of the Company's Concession Contract. The issue of increasing telephone prices had been submitted to the Public Utilities Committee for discussion. As a result, the committee recommended that the company's request be granted to increase prices according to the numbers in Mr. Ansey's report, and that items not explicitly mentioned in the report be increased accordingly, starting from March 27, 1932. At that time, the General Manager of the Concession Bureau also submitted a brief note to the committee, stating the results of the discussion between representatives of the two Concession Bureaus and representatives of the Company.</p>
<p>Due to the drop in the price of silver, the Company's capital expenditures have increased by 14 percent compared to the original estimate of Mr. Ansey. Moreover, there are significant shortcomings in Mr. Ansey's report. If implemented literally, the Company will lose the benefit of the allowed price increase. Mr. Ansey did not mention each item in the telephone price list. If items not mentioned are still charged at the original rate, there will be many loopholes, and the price increase can be evaded a lot. Therefore, the representatives of the Concession Bureau believe that the best way seems to be to correct Mr. Ansey's numbers so that they can be implemented, starting from March 27. At the same time, the request for a further increase in price will be investigated, and if reasonable, it will be implemented on a mutually agreed date in the future.</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Ansey's suggestion is to increase the price of business telephones by 34.6 percent and other telephones by 25 percent. The company's position is that items not explicitly specified should not remain the same. He believes this is fair, so the price list currently proposed by the company has included items not explicitly mentioned according to Mr. Ansey's proportions, but there are still some installation fees and other expenses that have not been added. However, the fee for temporary installation exceeds Mr. Ansey's proportion, because the fee for temporary use is intended to be higher than that for regular use. Therefore, the Chief Financial Officer believes that the table proposed by the company is in line with the wording or spirit of Mr. Ansey's report and recommends that the Board of Directors approve it.</p>
<p>The General Manager then stated that what the Concession Bureau approves at this time is only the price increase request based on Mr. Ansey's price rates. If a further price increase is requested in the future, the company should submit detailed explanations to the two Concession Bureaus. The Deputy Chief Financial Officer stated that he had received a report from the representative of the French Concession that the representative was also preparing to recommend to the French Concession Bureau the adoption of the price list proposed by the company.</p>
<p>A member of the Public Utilities Committee asked whether the adoption of Mr. Ansey's price list should be retroactive to March 27. The Chairman of the Committee replied that, according to the Concession Contract, the Concession Bureau could not but allow this. Another member stated that, in order to avoid misunderstandings among users, the approved revised price list should be made public, and it should be clearly announced that any further price increases will not be allowed until the two Concession Bureaus have fully considered the company's detailed explanations. The members of the committee all expressed their agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Li Jingzong Resigns as Aviation Director <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>German Side Tries Hard to Retain Him but Fails The Eurasia Aviation Company held its 12th Board of Directors meeting at its company on Renji Road yesterday. The Chinese directors present were Wei Yifu, Wang Zhiyuan, Li Jingzong, Lin Shi, Huang Naishu, and Wu Xixuan. The German directors were Schmidt, Borussen, and Fokker. The first item discussed was the company's organizational law. The Chinese directors felt that operating in accordance with the contract provisions was very inconvenient for personnel and other matters, and advocated that the authority of the General Manager should be effectively increased in the organization. The German directors, fearing that the Chinese side would abuse their power and hinder the German side's interests, advocated that the provisions of the contract should still be followed. The two sides' opinions were not compatible. As a result, it was decided by the general meeting to first promote Wei Yifu and Schmidt to study the organizational law drafted by the former General Manager Shuang Qing and Li Jingzong, and then submit it to the next Board of Directors meeting for discussion. Next, Wei Yifu reported that he had received a notice from the Ministry of Communications, a Chinese shareholder, that it was proposed to select Liao Guanxuan to fill the position of Director of the Operations Group, and that the original Director of the Operations Group, Li Jingzong, would serve as a Director. He asked the audience to decide whether this was acceptable. However, all the German directors expressed their opposition. The reason was that the Eurasia Aviation Mail Transport Contract was negotiated by Li with the German Hansa Aviation Company after a long period of consultation, and the Eurasia Aviation Company was also created by Li's painstaking efforts. Not only did he plan and preside over all internal facilities, but he also personally handled the adventurous test flights of new routes and negotiations with the authorities along the routes. If the Chinese side could not provide sufficient reasons to dismiss this most important and useful staff member, the German side, in order to take into account the future development of the company, would never agree to such a dismissal, even though it was in the minority in terms of voting. Li stated that although the German side's expression was intended to consider the future of the company, he felt very grateful for the excessive praise. However, since he had already decided to resign, he hoped that the issue of his stay or departure would not cause any embarrassment to both sides. At the same time, he immediately left the meeting to express his determination. Li's resignation telegram is excerpted as follows: To the Minister and Vice Minister of Communications, I, Li Jingzong, have worked tirelessly and sought progress since the establishment of the Eurasia Aviation Company and the operation of the Northwest Air Route. The current environment is deteriorating and I am afraid of failure. In addition to resigning from the position of Director of the company, I respectfully request that you approve my dismissal from all concurrent positions. Li Jingzong kowtows, etc. It is heard that Li holds important positions in the Ministry of Communications, including the head of the Aviation Section and a member of the Regulations Committee and the Material Procurement Review Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Compensation for Losses at Wusong Machinery Factory <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Our Side's Statement Comes First</p>
<p>Japanese Side Still Tries to Shirk Responsibility</p>
<p>Negotiation by China-British Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration yesterday sent a letter to the Takeover Committee stating that negotiations for compensation for the Wusong Machinery Factory, which was destroyed by the Japanese army, must still be conducted. On the one hand, the Central Bank of China negotiated with the Japanese side. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Retaining Compensation The Wusong Machinery Factory was occupied by the Japanese army after the January 28 Incident. At that time, internal machines, motors, and other items all fell into the hands of the Japanese because our railway bureau personnel did not have time to transport them out in advance. Although the takeover was carried out later, our railway bureau personnel, seeing that many items in the factory were lost, declared to the Japanese representative, Mr. Tokizawa Naoyoshi, at the time of the takeover that many items were missing and could not be received temporarily. The Japanese side resolutely refused. At that time, our side was under strong power and temporarily endured the takeover and signed a succession document. The document stated that all occupied items had been succeeded to the Chinese side. At that time, our side still retained the right to claim compensation for the missing items in the factory, and the representatives of the China-British Bank and the head of the Works Bureau, who were present, could testify.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Shirks Responsibility Recently, Japanese representative Okazaki declared to the Joint Committee that, regarding the Wusong Machinery Factory, because the Japanese side had signed a succession document with the Chinese side when handing over the factory, stating that all items had been handed over to the Chinese side, the Wusong Machinery Factory issue had nothing to do with the Japanese side thereafter.</p>
<p>Letter from the Two Railway Bureaus The Joint Committee subsequently informed our Takeover Committee of this point. The Takeover Committee immediately sent a letter to the two Railway Bureaus to inquire about the truth of the matter and what the situation was. The Railway Bureau replied to the Takeover Committee yesterday, stating that although the succession document was signed at the time, it still retained the right to claim compensation for the loss of all items in the factory, and the Japanese side should not shirk its responsibility.</p>
<p>Negotiation by China-British Bank The China-British Bank is negotiating with the Japanese side for compensation because the Japanese army occupied the Wusong Machinery Factory and damaged many items during the war. The Bank is also negotiating with the Japanese side due to the loan relationship. The Railway Bureau is also starting to investigate the losses of the Wusong Machinery Factory in detail in preparation for negotiations.</p>

<h3 id="e125">To Prevent Epidemics, Clean Drinking Water is Needed <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Liande's Talk</p>
<p>Hopes Health Authorities Will Pay Attention</p>
<p>The Mainland News reports that Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the National Seaport Quarantine Office, told the Mainland News yesterday (15th) that improving the habit of dumping garbage into the Huangpu River is only the beginning of our health and epidemic prevention campaign. The tiger epidemic this year is far from comparable to previous years. We must find a way to provide clean drinking water to the poor who cannot afford the current tap water prices, otherwise the consequences will be unimaginable. Today, the municipal authorities have not made appropriate provisions for supplying clean drinking water to hundreds of thousands of poor people in Shanghai, which is a major cause of the spread of the tiger epidemic. The water fees of the tap water companies are very high in the eyes of the poor and unbearable. I still remember that a year ago, the Public Works Bureau spent a lot of money to hire Mr. Hill, a New York expert, to come to Shanghai to investigate tap water. Mr. Hill's report advocated that lower water fees should be charged to the poor in this port, and the cost could be compensated by those who could afford it. Unfortunately, it was completely ignored and not implemented. It is hoped that the health authorities will discuss the issue of epidemic prevention this morning and also consider the issue of drinking water supply.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Public Opposition to Opium Monopoly <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Business Circles: The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Association, 16th District Branch, telegraphed the National Government yesterday, saying: "The opium monopoly is about to become a reality. All our merchants and people are deeply shocked. The lessons of the past are still vivid; who is without conscience? We strongly urge your government to issue a clear order to dispel rumors and to sweep away this harmful policy with swift and decisive action, for the sake of the nation's longevity." A declaration by the Shanghai West District Business Associations stated: "Since last year, the government, mindful of public opinion, voluntarily canceled the opium monopoly, hoping that the black scourge would not spread and that the shame of being called a 'sick man' would be washed away. Unexpectedly, rumors have recently spread that the government is considering reviving the old dream of an opium monopoly. We believe that since the central government has abolished this harmful policy before, it would not break its promise and lose the trust of the people. Moreover, the officials in power are all followers of Sun Yat-sen and would not dare to recklessly violate his teachings and adopt a suicidal policy. Therefore, we do not believe the rumors. However, the public discussion is becoming increasingly intense and seems to be true. Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai have even reported that Wang Jingwei's recent visit to Shanghai was to persuade Song Ziwen to agree to implement the opium monopoly as a condition for Song's reinstatement. Although the authorities have not acknowledged this, the rumors suggest that there may be some truth to it. Opium is a powerful tool for destroying a nation. Even though many powerful governments are suffering from budget deficits, few have resorted to collecting taxes on opium. Are international financiers less intelligent than our country? Alas, the value of a government lies in its ability to seek happiness for its people. If the government cannot be maintained without implementing the opium monopoly, then what is the value of this institution that poisons our people? We are determined to eradicate opium and are willing to die for it. We pledge to lead the 500,000 merchants and people in this district in a desperate battle against the demons of drug trafficking. We hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together to reverse the decline. We are overwhelmed with sorrow and do not know what to say." Shanghai West District Business Associations.</p>
<p>Women's Circles: The Shanghai Women's Suffrage Association, deeply concerned about the recent news of the opium monopoly, telegraphed the Executive Yuan yesterday, urgently stating: "To the Nanjing National Government: We have read reports and telegrams from various groups protesting the opium monopoly. We understand that the central government has decided to implement the opium monopoly system, causing widespread anxiety. The unacceptability of the opium monopoly is evident in the public opinion and discussions of recent years. Even the central government's anti-smoking authorities are hesitant and uncertain about this matter, wanting to implement it but not daring to, wanting to abandon it but not willing to. We believe they are also troubled and know that adopting this system is an act of betrayal of the country and the people. They are willing to sacrifice everything for temporary gains, neglecting the long-term harm. The central government is facing a financial crisis, which the people understand. However, besides opium, are there no other ways to solve the problem? Reduce the number of useless troops, cut down on redundant officials who waste public funds, develop legitimate sources of revenue, and reduce unnecessary government spending. There are many ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. If all these methods are deemed unfeasible and the opium monopoly must be implemented, indulging in power and using high-handed measures, then the central government's heart is set on profit and its hatred is for the people. It wants to exterminate the remnants of those who have suffered from man-made disasters, natural disasters, internal troubles, and foreign aggression. What have the people done to deserve such treatment? If they are forced to die, wouldn't they fight like cornered beasts, striving for their last chance of survival? We urge your government to carefully consider the situation, discern the advantages and disadvantages, and implement a complete ban on opium to appease the angry public and prevent sudden unrest. We await your decision with bated breath." Shanghai Women's Suffrage Association, printed.</p>

<p>The Murder Case on Yanping Road Solved</p>
<p>Cowardly Husband, Fierce Wife, Vicious Lover</p>
<p>Two Nephews Accuse for Uncle's Revenge</p>
<p>The Criminals Have Been Taken to the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The situation of an unidentified man being assassinated on the open space of Yanping Road next to the Shenyuan Dog Racing Track in Western Shanghai on the morning of the 14th has been detailed in this newspaper. It is now learned that this case is a major case of triangle love murder of the husband. Now the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Deceased's Condition: The deceased's name is Tang Rongzhi, 38 years old, from Yancheng. He made a living pulling rickshaws. He was naturally cowardly and worked hard. He married a woman named Yuan, who is now 37 years old. Her appearance is vulgar and her nature is lewd and unusually fierce. They have been married for nine years, but the husband sees his wife as a tiger and is very afraid of her, so they have no children. The couple lives in the 172nd room of the 9th Workshop on Binlang Road in Western Shanghai. Tang has two nephews, one named Tang Yuanjia and one named Tang Yuanli, who live in Zhabei and work in factories. Triangle Love: Yuan's nature is inherently lewd. One husband is not enough to satisfy her desire. Six years ago, she had an affair with a fellow villager named Gu Jide. At first, they secretly had an affair, and then they lived together at home. Tang was afraid of his wife as a tiger and dared not say a word. Yuan abandoned the old and loved the new, seeing her husband as a thorn in her side. Over the years, every time Tang returned home from work, he had to cook. Although the three of them ate at the same table, they treated Tang like a stranger. Gu also pulled a rickshaw. Recently, he and Tang rented a rickshaw together, taking turns to work. However, Yuan finally felt that her husband was an obstacle and scolded him all day long. The neighbors who heard it were all indignant. Even the two nephews were upset for their uncle, but they could do nothing.</p>
<p>Suspicion Solves the Case: After Yuan murdered her husband, she went to her nephews' place, saying that her husband had been out for two days and had not returned home, and she pretended to be alarmed. Her two nephews were suspicious. They all said that the assassination case was published in today's newspaper. They immediately went to the police station to ask to see the photo, which turned out to be their uncle Tang Rongzhi. They went to inquire near her house for a week and learned that she had indeed conspired with her lover to murder her husband. Yesterday morning, they took the woman and her lover Gu Jide to the Putuo Road Police Station to sue them. After the police chief briefly interrogated them, because the case occurred in the Chinese area, he ordered the deputy police chief to send Detective Shen Dehui to the 6th District Police Station for investigation.</p>
<p>Separate Interrogation: After questioning by District Chief Zhang, Tang Yuanjia, 31 years old, from Yancheng, resident of 38 Pushan Road, Zhabei, testified that he was a worker. Tang Yuanli, 25 years old, also from the same residence, accused Yuan and her lover of conspiring to murder Tang Rongzhi. Yuan, 37 years old, from Yancheng, resident of 172 Binlang Road, testified. Gu Jide, 34 years old, from Yancheng, who makes a living pulling rickshaws, stammered and evaded the murder of the deceased. After District Chief Zhang obtained the testimony, he considered the case to be a major one involving the accusation of murdering her husband, and ordered that the case be prepared and transferred to the General Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Wealthy Merchant Guo Ruman Deceives Female Painter into Marriage <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>First Wife Files a Lawsuit for Bigamy</p>
<p>Female Painter Also Makes a Scene</p>
<p>Guo Ruman, the son of wealthy merchant Guo Yonglan, is over forty years old. His original wife, Han Yueling, whom he married in the first year of the Republic of China, has three daughters, the eldest two of whom are already married, while the youngest is still at home. However, the love between Guo and Han has faded over the years. Guo became involved with other women and began to look for another. He heard that there were two female painters, the Xu sisters, in the City God Temple, who were both beautiful and talented. The older sister, Zhiqing, was nearly twenty years old and still unmarried. Guo asked Lian Jimin and Xing Chunhua to act as matchmakers, falsely claiming that he had never been married. The woman's uncle, Xu Guanchen, agreed to the marriage. They chose May 29th as the auspicious day and held the wedding at the Foreign Cloth Guild in Songjia Lane. The next day, Guo's first wife, Han Yueling, read an advertisement in the newspaper about her husband marrying Xu Zhiqing and was shocked. She immediately confronted her husband, hoping for a satisfactory resolution. As a result, she hired lawyer Yang Lizhi to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court against her husband Guo Ruman, the new bride Xu Zhiqing, Xu's uncle Xu Guanchen, and the matchmakers Lian Jimin and Xing Chunhua, requesting that they be punished according to the law. The complaint stated that they were guilty of bigamy and knowingly marrying a married person. The complaint stated that the plaintiff married the first defendant in March of the first year of the Republic of China, with the plaintiff's father Han Fangzhou and mother Han Ni serving as the officiants, and the defendant's father Guo Yonglan serving as the officiant, and Yan Shanshan and Han Bingwen as matchmakers. The formal marriage took place twenty years ago, and the plaintiff has since given birth to three daughters. The eldest daughter, Peizhen, is nineteen years old and married to the Fei family. The second daughter, Peiyu, is seventeen years old and engaged to the Zhou family. The third daughter, Peilin, is fifteen years old and still unmarried. The plaintiff was well-versed in family education. Since the marriage, she has only known how to follow her husband. However, the first defendant, Guo Ruman, was devoted to pleasure and did not work. Recently, he has become even more extravagant. On May 29th of this year, he held a formal wedding with the second defendant Xu Zhiqing in the hall of the Foreign Cloth Guild in Songjia Lane, Beijing Road, with Lian Jimin and Xing Chunhua acting as matchmakers. There is an announcement published by Guo Yonglan and Xu Guanchen in the newspaper on May 29th of this year as proof. The next day, there was another announcement in the newspaper thanking the guests. On the same day, there was also an announcement published by Guo Yonglan stating that he had not heard of the matters published in the announcement by Guo Yonglan and Xu Guanchen yesterday and could not be responsible. Therefore, the defendant Guo Ruman is already married and is guilty of bigamy. The evidence is irrefutable. Xu Zhiqing knowingly married him. The defendants Xu Guanchen, Lian Jimin, and Xing Chunhua helped the principal offender to commit the crime and deserve punishment. Therefore, in accordance with Article 5 of the New Agreement of the Public Concession Court, which states that other cases may be brought by the parties concerned, a self-accusation is brought requesting arrest and punishment in accordance with Article 254 of the Criminal Law. After the self-accusation was filed, the new bride Xu Zhiqing realized that she had been deceived. She had a conflict with the groom and returned to Ning alone in anger. It is heard that the court will soon summon both parties for a public trial.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Revival of Flower Gambling in the Chinese Area <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Orders Strict Prohibition of Flower Gambling, Which Harms Society Deeply. Flower gambling, which is deeply harmful and poisonous to society, was suspended due to the war and has disappeared for several months. Recently, there have been rumors of a revival of flower gambling in the Chinese area of Nanshi. However, most people do not believe it, thinking that it is impossible for it to revive in the Chinese area. Yesterday, a reporter from this newspaper found a pink leaflet that read: "Xinglong Company, Haha, the real old game is back. Shen Ahong, also known as the Sanbei Rice Sifter, is officially opening a large gambling house on the 16th of the Lunar Calendar (May 13th) in Xuejia浜, Nanshi. Closing, early game at 12 o'clock, Qingyuan, Jingli. Middle game at 7 o'clock, Bangui, Zhigao. Night game at 12 o'clock, Pinde, Kunshan." This proves that flower gambling has indeed revived, and the location of the gambling house is marked as Xuejia浜, Nanshi, which proves that the revival of flower gambling in the Chinese area is not unfounded. However, Mayor Wu Tiecheng had already heard about it and ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate and eliminate this poisonous substance completely.</p>

<p>The 10th District Branch of the Citizens' Association defended the tenants of Yangcifang, Zhu Baoluo and six other families, who were sued by the landlord, Elde &amp; Co., for rent arrears in the First Special District Court. The association applied for rent reduction and assistance. The rent reduction association sent lawyer Xu Bingcheng to court to defend them. The court ruled on June 15th that the tenants were exempt from rent for three months.</p>
<h3 id="e135">News from the Postal Economic System Research Association <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Will Recommend Specialized Personnel for Research. The Postal Economic System Research Association, with Wu Tiecheng and twelve other committee members, has not yet formally met since being appointed by the Executive Yuan, but the committee members have exchanged views and discussed methods several times. They all believe that the research on the fundamental improvements of the postal system's economy and system should be conducted by those with specialized postal knowledge or those with extensive experience in the postal field. Only then can perfect improvements be achieved. Each committee member has received a notice from Chairman Wu, stating that the first plenary meeting of the committee members will be held on the 18th at the Municipal Government. At that time, it is planned to propose that experienced postal specialists be appointed as commissioners of the research association to discuss and study the matter in order to facilitate the progress.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Postal Society: The Chinese Postal Society believes that the Postal Economic System Research Committee convened by the Executive Yuan is about to meet in Shanghai. Therefore, it has published a lengthy paper from the perspectives of theory and facts. The original text is tens of thousands of words long and is divided into three sections: (1) on savings and remittance business; (2) on airmail transportation; and (3) on allocations to the Ministry of Communications. Each section is further divided into several items. First, the principles of economics and finance are described. Second, the established rules of various countries are described. Third, the handling situation in our country is described. Finally, concrete solutions are proposed. To summarize its main points, regarding the Savings and Remittance Bureau, it is advocated to implement a merger. After the merger, the personnel should be screened and retained, and the accounts should be separated for postal and savings accounting. Regarding aviation, in principle, the post office should not bear subsidy obligations. However, in order to take into account the facts, the necessity of the routes should be reviewed, and a certain limit should be added to those that need subsidies, so as to facilitate postal services and not hinder the development of the postal service. Regarding the allocation of funds to the Ministry of Communications, it should be stopped immediately, and a special postal accounting system should be implemented. The surplus should be used to develop inland postal services and restore postal services in Mongolia, Tibet, and the border areas. However, before the Ministry of Communications' administrative expenses are resolved, the post office should temporarily remit a considerable amount each month to maintain it. In addition, no further orders should be issued for withdrawals. According to the society, it is organized by current and former postal personnel, and its purpose is to promote in-depth research on postal knowledge. Last time, it published lengthy articles on the issue of postage increases and the issue of postal rights in the Northeast, which attracted a lot of social attention. If any sectors have any opinions on the current postal economic issues and want to discuss them with the society, they can write to Shanghai Postal Box No. 336.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed Requesting the Abolition of the Special Business Tax in Jiangsu Province <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating that the Jiangsu and Anhui provinces plan to implement a special business tax. Shanghai newspapers reported that the Ministry of Finance had approved the abolition of similar Likin taxes. The promulgation of this decree was celebrated by merchants and people. It is now said that Jiangsu Province is directly levying a special business tax on silk, oil, beans, tea, cotton, bamboo, wood, etc., changing the original business tax to a license tax, which is said to be implemented on July 1st of this year. If this is not true, it contradicts the central government's intention to abolish Likin taxes the year before last, and it is feared that if this bad precedent is set, other provinces will follow suit, disrupting the tax policy and burdening the merchants and people. Therefore, we urgently request a review, hoping that the planned special business tax will be explicitly abolished to show clarity and fairness. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Two Township Associations Cheerfully Send Off the Volunteer Army <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Presenting a Volunteer Army Flag. The Sichuan Volunteer Army, which had successively left Sichuan to support Shanghai, originally had more than 400 people. More than 150 people also participated in the student volunteer army training camp of the 19th Route Army. Because the 19th Route Army was ordered to open up Fujian, more than 100 people were scattered. They came to Shanghai a few days ago and requested assistance from the Sichuan Township Association. The association has discussed this with the Citizens' United Association and designated the Dawang Temple on Xinzha Road as temporary accommodation. At the same time, it has also united with various groups of the National Salvation Federation to provide assistance. The National Salvation Federation has appointed Qiu He, Lin Zhifu, and Wu Banban to be responsible for handling the matter in order to fulfill the wishes of the volunteer army. The Sichuan Township Association specially held a farewell meeting at the association's auditorium yesterday afternoon to bid farewell to the volunteer army supporting Kang or the Northeast. More than 20 executive committee members of the association and more than 80 members of the Sichuan Volunteer Army attended. The meeting was chaired by Dong Fogong, with Wang Zuoqi giving a farewell speech and Dong Douyin presenting a volunteer flag, encouraging them to adhere to their original intentions and recover the lost territory in the Northeast, and not allow Kangzang to become the second Northeast. The volunteer army was represented by Hu Ya, Longquan, Chen Baofu, Jiang Jueming, Cheng Qinghua, Yang Shaojian, and Wei Xia, who gave thank-you speeches, all of which were impassioned and tearful. One-third of them were willing to go to the Northeast, and the rest were willing to go to Kangzang, all expressing that they would not rest until they had shed their blood. The photography session began at 5:00 PM and then dispersed.</p>
<p>Fujian Township Association: The Minnan Shanghai Township Association hosted a banquet for the Overseas Chinese Volunteer Team and the Xiamen Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association at the YMCA Restaurant in Baxianqiao last night. Representatives of both groups attended. First, Mr. Qiu Hanping, a representative of the township association, gave a welcoming speech and encouraged them, saying that overseas Chinese should be self-aware in order to save themselves and others. Then, Mr. Ji Liande of the Overseas Chinese Volunteer Team described his return to China and the various hardships he felt in the country. Finally, Mr. Wu, a representative of the Xiamen Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association, reported on the banditry in Fujian Province and the various atrocities committed by the militia against the people. The host and guests dispersed happily at about 10 o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Fresh Meat Industry in Disaster Areas Appeals for Exemption from Donations <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai War Zone Industry and Commerce Revitalization Committee is vigorously carrying out the war zone revitalization plan and plans to request the authorities to exempt war zone donations and taxes. The committee received yesterday a petition from the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association, forwarded by Ye Shunxing and 24 other merchants in the disaster areas of Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhenru, to the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that it be forwarded. The petition states that the petitioners, Guan Xiangsheng, Xian Baoshun, Shen Changfu, Zhang Jingchun, Gu Wenyu, Wang Peixi, and others, are fresh meat merchants from the disaster areas of Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhenru. It is submitted to request a compassionate understanding of the severe suffering and difficulty in resuming business in the war zones, and to order a postponement of the collection until six months later, so as to ease the burden. The disaster victims' fresh meat shops in various places suffered severe damage from the invasion of the Japanese pirates on January 28th. After more than a month of fierce fighting and occupation, they were subjected to destruction and bombing, which was extremely intense. Houses were destroyed, families were broken, and lives were lost. It is now possible to gradually collect the refugees and return to their hometowns. The disaster victims were forced to build thatched sheds on the rubble and wilderness, hoping to reorganize their old business. However, they received notices from the Inspection Department of the Health Bureau and the Collection Department of the Finance Bureau, stating that they would continue to levy the post-slaughter inspection fee and slaughter tax according to the old point system. The suffering of the disaster victims after the disaster is still not relieved. Only a small number of disaster victims have scraped together money from all over the place, pawned their belongings, and borrowed money to beg the government for the slaughter improvement funds, and the charity relief funds released by the management committee. They used this to buy fresh pigs for slaughter and distribution, hoping to make a small profit to support their families. How can they talk about resuming business? How can they bear the burden of the officials coming to collect taxes? Under duress, they jointly signed and sealed this petition to appeal to the Mayor to show compassion and care, and to order Director Hu of the Health Bureau and Director Cai of the Finance Bureau to show kindness and empathy, and to allow the disaster areas to postpone the collection for six months, so that the survivors of the disaster can regain their breath.</p>

<p>The Zhabei War Zone Disaster Victims Appeal Meeting held its third regular meeting the day before yesterday, with more than 30 people attending. Jiang Zhongliang was elected as chairman. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, Shen Xinfu and Fang Shulan proposed seven items. After detailed discussion by the committee members, and after six or seven hours of debate, concrete measures were taken. At present, the association has registered more than 3,000 disaster households. However, the number of victims in Zhabei is actually more than that. In order to make it more accessible, registration points have been set up at the Zhabei Charity Group and at the law firm of Guo Wei on the upper floor of the Huiwentang on Qipan Street in the British Concession. Disaster victims in Zhabei can go there to register at any time.</p>

<p>Building Mansions... Benefiting the Disaster Victims. The Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association, in view of the large number of villages and houses destroyed in the battlefield and the inability of the poor disaster victims to recover, causing them to be displaced and homeless, which is heartbreaking to see, specially allocated 300,000 yuan at the end to build civilian housing. Hu Yunqiu, Yang Yanfang, Yang Zhixiong, and Hu Yunzhuang were elected as processing committee members to be in charge of the matter. Together with Shi Liangcai, Zhang Gongquan, and Huang Renzhi of the Jiangsu Provincial War Zone Relief Committee, and the gentry of the Shanghai urban area and the three counties of Tai, Jia, and Kunshan, they jointly discussed and organized the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association Songhu Memorial Village Committee, formulated the articles of association, allocated funds, conducted on-site surveys, planned construction, and invited merchants to bid, which was a complicated and laborious process. It is heard that Zhang Hengxing Woodworking and Gongrun Construction Factory have respectively contracted to undertake the construction, and signed the contract yesterday, and will start construction in Miaohang, the most severely affected area, on an auspicious day. The other places are also being handled in succession.</p>
<p>###济生会执监联席会议</p>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society held a joint meeting of the supervisors and executive committee’s six groups yesterday. More than thirty people attended, including Chairman Wang Yiting, Vice Chairmen Xu Qianlin and Huang Hanzhi, and various committee members. A certain Director Zhenwu reported on the disaster relief efforts of the previous year in Anhui South, Anhui North, Jiangsu Jiangning Jurong, Jiangnan Jiangbei, Henan Nanyang Dengxian Tanghe Xinye Biyang, Shaanxi Wugong and other counties. The relief funds allocated by the provinces of Henan, Anhui, and Shaanxi were insufficient. The report listed relief funds, clothing, and other items from January 1st to May 31st of this year. As of the end of May this year, the funds already determined but not yet paid, after deducting deposits, showed an actual loss of tens of thousands of yuan (2). The Society was involved in disaster relief for both Shanghai and Jiangsu during the January 28th Japanese invasion of Shanghai, which caused heavy shelling. Four refugee camps were set up in Shanghai and one wounded soldier hospital, as well as seven refugee camps in Jiangsu. The expenditures for these are listed in a separate detailed account. According to the director’s report, the Society currently lacks tens of thousands of yuan. Due to the sluggish market, sources of funds have been exhausted. Furthermore, the work on the dikes and embankments in various counties in the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Jiangxi has not yet been completed. The people lack seeds and food, and starvation is widespread. Letters and telegrams requesting aid arrive like snowflakes. Although some aid is provided, it is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. The greatest difficulty is the large number of displaced people in the Shanghai area, requiring substantial funds for relief. Although efforts are made to provide some assistance, it is very limited, causing deep regret among the staff. In the counties of Henan Nanyang Dengxian Xinye Biyang Tanghe, the disaster is severe, but the relief funds are meager, making the aid feel like no aid at all.</p>
<p>There is no solution to the issue. Additionally, the Haitang dike project in Ninghai, Zhejiang, still lacks more than ten thousand yuan, making assistance impossible. Neither abandoning it nor continuing it is acceptable. Due to continuous heavy rain, the project is in jeopardy and in a precarious state, causing great anxiety (3). The rescue team’s Director, Zhang Weixianqing, reported that the various accounts of the rescue team are listed in a separate statement. The Shanghai rescue team of the Society rescued tens of thousands of displaced people from January 29th to May 31st, including more than six hundred and forty wounded soldiers. The refugee camps accommodated over five thousand six hundred and fifty people, and more than three thousand one hundred people were provided with funds to return to their hometowns. All have now been assisted in their departure (4). Zhu Weiqichen said that in these times of natural and man-made disasters, with widespread suffering, these kinds of phenomena occur because people's hearts are not as they used to be, morality has declined, and thriftiness is not practiced. These three points will lead to the shaking of the foundation of the nation and the bankruptcy of the economy. Not only is this the case in our country, but also in many other European countries, where there is also no peace and tranquility. The crisis facing our country is becoming increasingly urgent and difficult to remedy. If society does not awaken again, the future is bleak. If we want to eliminate the calamities, we must first start by rectifying people's hearts. If we want to rectify people's hearts, we must promote morality, such as loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace, with the promotion of thriftiness as the guiding principle. Our Society, as a charitable organization, should unite as many like-minded people as possible to advise and rescue people in the major matters of morality and thrift. Over time, there may be hope of transforming people's hearts and reversing the final calamity. Otherwise, if the water and drought disasters of recent years spread to sixteen provinces, and if the provinces that were affected by disasters last year experience another poor harvest this year in the late autumn rainy season, then the troubles facing our country will be unimaginable. I hope everyone will pay attention to this. All of us should encourage ourselves and others, widely promote these ideas, and announce them in newspapers so that everyone can be inspired to take action in order to reverse the situation. (5) Director Zhenwu and Zhang Weixianqing proposed that Zheng Chuheng, the chairman of the Liuhe branch, reported that due to the tragic disasters after the war in Liuhe Qianjing Yiqiao Yanglinkou Qiyakou Xintangshi and other places, there are five or six hundred households of disaster victims who have no homes to return to. They requested appropriate relief. After deliberation, it was decided to allocate two hundred and thirty shi of rice to be distributed by Zheng Chuheng, along with relief workers, specifically to the poorest households in Liuhe and other places. The funds must not be wasted, and the work must be practical. The public approved and resolved the matter. The meeting adjourned at six o'clock.</p>

<p>Shareholders' Meeting of the Chinese-Owned Public Bus Company</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Chinese-owned Public Bus Company held its fourth shareholders' meeting yesterday at Tao Yi Restaurant on Wuchang Road. One hundred and fifty-nine shareholders attended, representing four thousand five hundred and seventy-nine shares. An Zhongrui was specially sent by the Public Utilities Bureau to attend. Huang Zhongwen presided over the meeting, which began with the appropriate ceremonies. First, the board of directors reported that due to the rising gold prices, the company's business had increased, but there were no profits. Unexpectedly, the recent fighting in Zhabei caused significant damage to the vehicles. Although the war zone has been gradually recovered, the market is sluggish and vitality has not yet been restored. Therefore, only a few buses are currently operating. However, the company has been granted a twelve-year patent by the Municipal Government. In the future, as the market develops and the Municipal Government has news of recovering the roads built beyond the concession boundaries, coupled with the Public Works Bureau's paving of slag on the Nanxiang road, it is expected that traffic will be possible upon completion, and the driving area will be further expanded, and business will be more promising. Then, discussion began: (1) Increase the share capital to 200,000 yuan. In addition to old shares being allowed to purchase two-tenths, the remainder will be publicly offered as soon as possible. (2) The board of directors should plan for Nanxiang transportation vehicles in the shortest possible time. (3) Election of directors. The elected directors were Huang Zhongwen, Wu Hongshu, Lei Shengchun, Tan Yichuang, Lei Zhaopeng, Zhang Bingrong, Shi Tifen, Lei Jiaang, and Li Bingchang. The alternates were Huang Nengwen and Feng Yixian. The elected supervisors were Shen Weiting. After the election, refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3 id="e145">大塲災民之呼籲 <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Appeal of the Disaster Victims of Dachang</p>
<p>Objections to the Distribution of Relief Funds: Shen Feixiong, Yao Liting, Yu Hengfu, Lu Mingzhong, Lu Sheng, and other disaster victims of Dachang heard that the Jiangsu War Zone Relief Association had allocated 80,000 yuan for Baoshan relief and plans to distribute it by district within a few days, allocating it equally to the number of disaster-stricken households in the entire county. Various local groups believe that Dachang suffered the most damage and should not be allocated in this way. They are appealing to all parties, expressing their opposition. Their words roughly stated: This disaster, in addition to Shanghai, is the most severe in Baoshan Province. Among the counties of Baoshan, Dachang is the most affected. Miaohang Sanbai Mu and other places within the war zone are under the jurisdiction of Dachang, resulting in more than two thousand households being burned, bombed, or damaged by artillery fire in the nearby area. The severity of the disaster is self-evident. Other areas, such as Luodian and Liuhang, have not suffered direct losses and have no disaster to speak of. Relief should be based on factual needs. Now, the association is not using the severity of the disaster as the standard for allocating relief funds, but rather using the number of disaster-stricken households in the entire county as the standard. This not only contradicts the principles of relief, but also loses the effectiveness of relief. In order to seek real benefits, the disaster victims cannot remain silent. In addition to requesting the district chief to forward a request to the association to change the original proposal, they also ask people from all walks of life to uphold justice to comfort the disaster victims.</p>

<p>Renji Hospital Held its Annual Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>With Eighty-Five Years of History</p>
<p>Many Surprising Treatment Achievements</p>
<p>The Renji Hospital Donors' Annual Meeting was held yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM at the new hospital site in the McTyeire Compound on Shandong Road. Sir Graham presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, stating that this annual meeting was the first at the new site and was worth commemorating. Seeing the tall buildings, completely new, was a far cry from the house on Pingzhi Road last year. He then described the changes Renji Hospital had undergone throughout its history and its service to the local community in great detail. Finally, Mr. Puff proposed and passed the 1931 report and financial statement. Mr. Puff then gave a thank-you speech on behalf of the Renji Hospital staff, which was answered by Dr. Patterson, the hospital director. Dr. Orr then stood up and reported on the aspirations of the Lister Medical Research Institute and the process of its establishment. Hui Jun then nominated Brown, Potter, Puff, and Wells as trustees, which was seconded and passed by Pan Zhiquan. Wells then nominated Bell, Brand, Zhang Lanping, Chen Bingqian, Chen Xuejia, Pan Zhiquan, Ni Xichun, Blythe, Wang Yiting, Hui, Huang Hanzhi, and others as hospital directors for 1932, which was seconded and passed by Mr. Chen. Finally, Dr. Patrick thanked the attendees on behalf of the chairman, and the meeting adjourned. Before the meeting, Dr. Chen Shaopu, the director of surgery, and others led the guests to visit the new hospital site. The location is spacious, and the buildings are tall and airy, with a total of six floors. All the equipment is perfect, and more attention is paid to surgery and first aid. For example, a special room is set up for the rapid rescue of opium poisoning victims, as there are suicides by poisoning in Shanghai every day. According to the hospital's report last year, a total of 1,155 people were sent for treatment for attempted suicide, including 521 women and 364 men who committed suicide by swallowing opium, totaling 885 people. Therefore, this equipment also meets the requirements of the local area. The X-ray department is located on the second floor and is managed by Dr. Payne. Last year, 1,860 patients were examined by X-ray, and 3,280 photos were taken. The operating room occupies a very important position in the hospital, with complete equipment. Last year, 1,422 surgical procedures were performed in the outpatient department, and 1,320 surgical procedures were performed on inpatients. According to Dr. Chen, the hospital performs major surgeries that are rarely seen elsewhere. A worker who had been suffering from abdominal pain for two years was admitted to the hospital for treatment. Dr. Chen performed surgery and removed about eight feet of his large intestine, and the disease was cured. Afterwards, the patient held the removed intestine and wrapped it around his abdomen, taking a photo for research. Such a case of removing one-third of the entire large and small intestines has only been recorded once in England. Recently, a patient named Lu Agao had a diseased gallbladder removed, which was as large as half a fist. An old man over sixty years old had a bladder disease treated by surgery and is still alive. Another patient named Jia had his entire anus and rectum removed and replaced with an artificial anus, and can still live normally. There are countless such cases. Finally, we visited the fifth floor, where the director of the research department is Dr. Orr. This department is named</p>
<p>the Lister Medical Research Institute, and also has a site on Aiwen Road, attached to Renji Hospital, which is part of it, to enable research and experimentation on patients. The work there is also quite busy. Last year's report, the 85th time, the McTyeire Compound Renji Hospital, from its inception in July 1846, to 1931, has gone through 85 years of history.</p>

<p>The National Crisis People's Hospital to Open</p>
<p>Organized by Central Committee Member He Xiangning and others, the... 士 rescue council worked especially hard during the recent Shanghai war. People from all walks of life recognized this early on. After the war, the area is feared to be followed by a major epidemic. Residents' food is still difficult to secure. Once diseases are discovered, they will inevitably be left to die. In order to prevent this and rescue the poor, the council discussed the issue with Dongnan Medical College, Wei Guoqi Yuan, Medical Director Tang Zhou, and organized the National Crisis People's Hospital near the Gordon Police Station on Kangtuo Road. Doctors Liu Peihua, Wang Jiheng, Obstetrician Shu Suqin, and others were appointed to various departments and are scheduled to open for diagnosis on the 21st of this month.

<p>The Huang Shizi Hospital at No. 192 East Jiaxing Road, Hongkou, was founded by Mr. Song Kunshan, a philanthropist from Anhui Province. It has been established for more than ten years. The original site was in Xiangyan Bridge, but it was recently relocated to this location after the war. Director Dr. Song Jacob and Dr. Hu Zhongxian are both knowledgeable and experienced physicians. Dr. Song recently believed that there would inevitably be a severe epidemic after the war, so he specially made 100,000 bottles of plague prevention medicine to distribute to nearby shops and residents for prevention. The hospital also recognizes that there are many factories and workers in the area, so it does not charge consultation fees for patients, and provides free medication to the poor and sick.</p>

<p>Liu Jiju Resumes Normal Consultations</p>
<p>National physician Liu Jiju was formerly a specially contracted physician at the Commercial Press. In order to facilitate his service, Mr. Liu and his family rented a residence at No. 5 Zhongxin Lane, Hengshan Road, Zhabei. In addition to providing consultations at the Commercial Press, he also set up a study at his residence to meet external consultation needs. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai war broke out, and he fled with his family in a hurry. All of his movable property was destroyed and reduced. His lifelong efforts were lost overnight.

<p>A Special Book on the Postal Economic System is Published</p>
<p>Strengthening the postal base movement is the only important strategy for saving the postal service today, but the facts belong to specialized research. This system is something that the general public desires to know but cannot immediately understand. In view of this, the China Postal Society has specially compiled and printed the book "Research on the Postal Economic System in the Movement to Strengthen the Postal Base." In addition to the introduction and conclusion at the beginning and end, it is divided into three parts: internal and external: (1) on savings and remittance business, (2) on airmail transportation, (3) on appropriations to the Ministry of Communications. Based on the facts, the research on the postal economic system is clearly explained. It is truly a great work that those who care about postal affairs cannot afford not to read. Those who wish to read it can send a letter to the Chinese Postal Society via the Post Office Laborer Bimonthly in this port and it will be provided free of charge.</p>

<p>Record of the Trial of the Morphine Case Cracked on Yao Zhujiao Road</p>
<p>Each Person Denies Any Involvement Cleanly: On the morning of the 12th of this month, Chinese and Western detectives from the Beidang Road Police Station in the French Concession cracked down on a private morphine manufacturing organization at a Western-style house at No. 121 Yao Zhujiao Road. They confiscated a large number of manufacturing machines and equipment, as well as finished and unfinished morphine raw materials in both dry and wet forms, weighing a total of more than 190 catties. Seven people from Sichuan, Zhao Youming and Ou Yongxiang, and their accomplices, Hou Yunshan and Hou Lihe, father and son from Guizhou, and Liu Mingzhang and Tu Hongfa from Sichuan, and Jin Yushan from Hubei were arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution and detention for investigation in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday was the date for the continued trial. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Judge Xiong Hui and Clerk Gu Shouxi presided over the hearing in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated that the investigation procedures on the police side had not yet been completed, and requested a postponement. However, for the benefit of the defendants, he requested that the trial be rescheduled for the shortest possible period. The court immediately ordered separate trials. According to Zhao Youming, he rented the house at No. 121 Yao Zhujiao Road in April, intending to move in himself in the summer. Later, Wang Hanzhang, a friend from Hankou, discussed with him that his family was coming to Shanghai and he did not have time to find a rental house. He asked me to sublet the house to him. Because we were friends for many years, I agreed, setting the monthly rent at 200 yuan and agreeing to start the lease on May 15th. He moved in ten days later. I transferred the hired Hou Yunshan, Hou Lihe, and Liu Mingzhang to Wang's employment. Wang went to Hankou after moving in to pick up his family in Shanghai. I knew nothing about the private manufacturing of morphine in the house. Hou Yunshan stated that he was hired by Mr. Zhao to guard the door at No. 121 Yao Zhujiao Road. I have only known Zhao for a month or so. I used to work for Director Qiu. When Qiu returned to Guizhou, he recommended me to Zhao for employment. Zhao sublet the house to someone else, and I did not know about it. But I only managed the downstairs, and never went to the second or third floors. I don't know about the morphine. My wages were paid by Zhao. Zhao came to check every two days, and no other outsiders came. Liu Mingzhang is the cook. However, there was someone who looked like a worker who came early and left late every day. I don't know what they were doing. Hou Lihe is my son. He washes the floor and serves tea. Jin Yushan stated that he was specially hired by Mr. Zhao to tend the garden and guard the door at No. 121 Yao Zhujiao Road, and to take care of a dog. I only went in for a week, and I don't know anything else. I don't know who rented the house. Usually, there were two or three people wearing short clothes coming and going empty-handed. I don't know what they were doing. Hou Lihe stated that he was hired by Mr. Zhao and had been there for a month or two. I didn't go upstairs. I don't know about the morphine. There were only five of us downstairs, including the five people in the case. I don't know about other people. Xu Hongfa stated that he only swept the floor and wiped the windows. He didn't go upstairs. He didn't know about the morphine manufacturing. I only went in for five days, so I don't know the details. Liu Mingzhang stated that he was the cook. There were seven people, including the five people here, plus two upstairs. The boss is Mr. Zhao, and I don't know the surname Ou. Ou Yongxiang stated that he did not rent the house at No. 121 Yao Zhujiao Road, nor had he been there. He knew nothing about the morphine. On the day of the arrest, I met Mr. Zhao on Sapo Sai Road. He told me to go to the police station with him. When I arrived at the police station, I was detained. I don't know why, etc. The defendants Zhao and Ou hired lawyers Xu Yannian and Zhao Zuwei for defense. The court ordered a postponement and another trial on the morning of the 20th of this month. The defendants were remanded to the police station.</p>

<p>Zhou Shiying Was Keen on Doing Good Deeds</p>
<p>Zhou Shiying, a Ningbo native who founded the Private Property Public Righteousness Association, established a nursing home in Nanxiang eight years ago. Because the Chinese army retreated to the second line of defense, Japanese soldiers arrived in Xiang and threw bombs, destroying the hospital and killing five elderly women. Mr. Zhou was frightened and his illness worsened. He passed away in late last month. His will stated that the hospital affairs should be taken over by the Chinese Christian Tianan Church. The church council passed the original text of the will and temporarily sent Han Junzongzhu to receive the hospital.</p>
<p>###鳳陽輪買辦被髮妻控請離異</p>
<p>Once Mediated, No Compliance</p>
<p>Yesterday's Debate Concluded</p>
<p>Dai Xincai, from Yin County, works as a comprador on the Fenghuang Wheel steamboat. Recently, his wife, Zhao Cuiyun, also from their hometown, accused him of malicious abandonment and, through lawyer Zhou Bingyang, filed for divorce with the First Special District Court. The reasons stated are as follows: She married Dai five years ago, and they initially lived harmoniously. However, starting the year before last, he had an affair, became addicted to opium, and his behavior drastically changed. He frequently beat her, causing the plaintiff to suffer abuse and develop a desire to end her life. During the first month of the year before last, she attempted suicide by overdosing on tranquilizer water but was saved. When Zhao's brother questioned Dai, Dai acknowledged his wrongdoing and vowed to change. However, he was insincere. In June of last year, while home sick, he emptied all her dowry and refused to return her clothes and belongings. She had to temporarily reside with her mother, depending on her brother for support. In August and September, relatives were sent multiple times to persuade him to reconcile, but he refused. In October, as the weather turned cold and life became difficult, she sent a lawyer's letter warning him. She then received a reply from his lawyer, Song, advising Zhao not to harbor any other intention. Zhao had no other intention and, on November 5th, went to live with him. Unexpectedly, the defendant's parents and his younger brother, Xing Geng, tricked her out of the house, repeatedly refusing to let her return. She had no choice but to return to her parents' home. On December 1st, she again sent a lawyer's letter warning him. For half a year, there has been no news. Such behavior clearly indicates a complete severance of affection. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit requesting a divorce and asking the court to order him to pay alimony of three thousand yuan, as well as return her dowry and other items. This case has been heard, and the judge kindly advised them, hoping to reconcile them. He also verbally instructed Dai Xincai not to have any more affairs and to allow Zhao Cuiyun to use her dowry, and that his parents should no longer abuse Zhao Cuiyun. During the adjournment, both parties' lawyers were asked to mediate. However, during this adjournment, the two parties could not reach a satisfactory resolution. Yesterday, the court session was held again. The judge asked the plaintiff if she was willing to live with him, and the plaintiff replied that she wanted a divorce. The defendant claimed that after his wife left home, he had gone to pick her up several times, and his younger brother, Xing Geng, had also gone to welcome her back home, but the plaintiff firmly refused. As for the dowry and other items, they were still in the house. The plaintiff claimed that these were not facts at all, and presented to the court photos of Dai with his mistress as evidence. At this point, the court ordered the debate to begin and announced that the verdict would be delivered on the 22nd.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, Xu Chen, who claims that the Shen Bao's local news column on the 14th of this month reported on the Caojing Defense Corps capturing a thief, stating that Xu Yongnian was killed and two bullet casings were found in his house. This is shocking. Xu Chen and her husband, Xu Yongnian, live in Sanjia Village and make a living by transporting manure. They are law-abiding, as everyone in the neighborhood knows. On the morning of the 12th of this month, Wu Rugui, the captain of the first squad of the Xiaomuqiao Defense Corps, and squad leader Zhu Maosong led more than twenty members of the corps to surround the thatched hut where she lived. They suddenly opened fire inside, firing more than a hundred shots. Her husband was fatally wounded and died. The captain and others then entered the house and conducted a thorough search, overturning beds and knocking down walls, but found nothing. They also threw her daughter, Mao Hai, from the bed to the ground, causing her death. Peng, the police officer from the Xinxin District branch of the Second District Public Security Bureau, witnessed these tragic scenes. My client's brother, husband, and daughter have suffered tragic deaths and are being unfairly accused. How can she remain silent? In addition to filing a lawsuit with the local court against Wu Rugui, Zhu Maosong, and others, I am requesting that you publish a correction in the Shen Bao to clarify the truth. Yours sincerely, Attorney Shen Yiqian, June 16th.</p>

<p>Funds Will Be Fully Disbursed Starting in July</p>
<p>Professors and Students Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondent: Li Ximou, Dean of the College of Engineering of Zhejiang University, resigned due to student dissatisfaction. President Cheng Tianfang returned to Zhejiang from Beijing the day before yesterday. This reporter visited the Zhejiang University Secretariat yesterday and learned that Dean Li resigned because of difficulties in managing the college and because he had accepted the Ministry of Education's invitation to go to Europe to investigate industrial education. He will be leaving soon, so he firmly requested to resign from the position of Dean of the College of Engineering. President Cheng had repeatedly tried to retain Dean Li, who had served in the position for a long time and was very familiar with the situation. Li was determined not to return to the college, explaining the various difficulties. Out of consideration for Dean Li, President Cheng did not want to force him to do something he found difficult. Li also proposed that President Cheng temporarily serve concurrently as Dean before a successor was appointed, to avoid the disruption of college affairs and the students' studies. After careful consideration, President Cheng also felt that this was the most appropriate solution during the transition period. Yesterday afternoon, he separately invited the professors and students of the College of Engineering to a meeting to announce this decision, asking the professors to continue teaching with peace of mind and to plan for the progress of the next academic year. He also reported on the results of his negotiations in Beijing regarding funding. President Wang and Minister Zhu were responsible for responding that the full amount would be disbursed monthly starting in July. Chairman Chiang was concerned about Zhejiang University and, in his personal capacity, telegraphed the provincial government to also fully disburse funds starting in July. With funding secured, the university's future is very promising. The professors and students all expressed satisfaction, so this matter has been completely resolved, which should be reassuring to those in society who care about the university.</p>

<p>Since the resignation of former President Zhu, the National Central University has been facing a shortage of funds. Coupled with the national crisis, education throughout the country has been in a precarious state. In the past, the university was entirely supported by Jiangsu education funds, but since last winter, the Jiangsu Education Fund Management Office decided to cancel the funding, making the university's economic future even more bleak. Fortunately, the Ministry of Finance has taken on the responsibility. In early May, half of the salaries for April were issued. On the 21st, 60% of the salaries for November were issued. On the 4th of this month, half of the salaries for May were issued. On the 9th, half of the salaries for December were issued, with a gap of about one and a half months. (Location)</p>

<p>National Vocational Education Discussion Meeting to Be Held Concurrently</p>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Education Society usually holds a general meeting of members every two years and a national vocational education discussion meeting every year. It is reported that the 12th general meeting of members this year is scheduled to be held in Fuzhou from August 8th to 10th. The 10th national vocational education discussion meeting will be held concurrently. The Fujian Education Department has expressed its warm welcome and has telegraphed its agreement to send personnel to assist. At a time when the country is facing a crisis and the people are suffering, the importance of promoting vocational education has been recognized by the national education community. The society's notice has already been issued and sent to the education departments of various provinces and the education bureaus of various cities, inviting them to send representatives to participate in the discussions. The notification and the instructions for attending the meeting are listed below:</p>
<p>Notification: Dear Sirs, At the previous general meeting of members of the Society (July 1930) and the national vocational education discussion meeting (August 1931), it was decided that the next meeting (i.e., this year's meeting) would be held in Liaoning or Fujian. Now, after the Northeast Incident, Liaoning Province has been lost and has not yet been recovered. In accordance with the previous resolution, the second location, Fujian, should be selected. It is now scheduled to hold the 12th general meeting of members and the 10th national vocational education discussion meeting in Fuzhou from August 8th to 10th, to report on the progress of the Society's affairs and to discuss issues related to vocational education facilities.

<p>Graduates Hold Meeting to Protect Their Alma Mater</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Education explicitly ordered the closure of Labor University, it yesterday notified the school that all students of the school are allowed to transfer to other national universities. Students should quickly report which school they wish to enter, so that the schools can be notified to comply.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that their alma mater had been ordered to close by the Ministry, the graduates of the school in Shanghai held a meeting at the Social Science Institute on Labor Father Road yesterday afternoon. Those present were Sun Le, Tao Yuhao, Yuan Zhe, and Cao Mingquan, who served as recorders. After the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, the graduates expressed extreme indignation at the Executive Yuan's decision to close Labor University. They immediately organized a school protection movement committee, appointed responsible personnel, and resolved to issue a declaration, send representatives to visit the founders Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Chu Minyi, and Wu Zhihui, to petition the Executive Yuan to withdraw the decision, and to send letters to graduates in various places to intensify school protection efforts locally.</p>

<p>"Do Not Remove the Garden Weeds," by Zhai Fu, 28</p>
<p>These few words written by Mr. Zhu have confused me. From my previous understanding, knowledge comes before action. But now Mr. Zhu considers action as the father, knowledge as the son, and creation as the grandson, which is exactly the opposite of my understanding. If I am right, then he must be wrong. If he is right, then I must be wrong. I think and think, and cannot say that I am definitely right, nor can I say that he is definitely wrong. I am going around in circles and cannot find a way out. Unable to justify myself, I finally asked Mr. Zhu for evidence to explain his argument.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu asked me, "Do you know how to ride a cow?" I said, "Yes." "How did you acquire the knowledge of riding a cow?" "I learned it by riding on the cow's back a few times." "Good, riding a cow is action, and knowing how to ride is knowledge. So knowledge comes from action, doesn't it?" "Yes."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu asked again, "Do you know how to swim?" I said, "Yes." "Think again about how you acquired the knowledge of swimming." "I learned it by swimming in the water a few times." "Good, swimming is action, and knowing how to swim is knowledge. So it can be seen that knowledge comes from action, doesn't it?" "Yes."</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and asked Mr. Zhu in return, "We know that fire is hot and we pull back our hands when we encounter fire. Knowing that fire burns is knowledge, and pulling back our hands when encountering fire is action. Isn't this knowing before acting?" Mr. Zhu said, "What is fire? What is burning? Did you know this from birth?" "I don't think I knew it from birth. Maybe someone told me." "Someone can tell you that fire is hot, and they can also tell you that fire is cold. Who is telling the truth, and who is lying? How do you judge, how do you distinguish, and how do you know? How do you know that fire is definitely hot and definitely not cold? How do you know that the person who told you fire is hot is telling the truth? And how do you know that the person who told you fire is cold is lying?" "I think I would try it with my hand on the fire and then I would know." "That's right. When you were in your mother's arms, you once reached out to play with fire and got burned, and then you knew that fire was a dangerous thing, so now when you see fire, you pull back your hand. Reaching out to play with fire is action, and knowing that fire burns is knowledge. Doesn't this prove that action comes before knowledge?"</p>

<p>The Success Story of Miss Helen Madison (2) Huai Qing The Greatest Success</p>
<p>This Seattle girl, proficient in water sports, has the same speed and strength in long-distance swimming as in short-distance swimming. Her recent new record for 100 yards is 60 and four-fifths seconds, while her one-mile swim is 24 minutes, 34 and three-fifths seconds. The world records officially held by Miss Madison are as follows (all freestyle):</p>
<p>100 yards 60 and four-fifths seconds</p>
<p>100 meters 1 minute 8 seconds</p>
<p>150 yards 1 minute 40 and two-fifths seconds</p>
<p>200 meters 2 minutes 34 and three-fifths seconds</p>
<p>220 yards 2 minutes 35 seconds</p>
<p>300 yards 2 minutes 39 seconds</p>
<p>300 meters 3 minutes 59 and five-tenths seconds</p>
<p>400 meters 5 minutes 39 and three-fifths seconds</p>
<p>440 yards 5 minutes 39 and three-fifths seconds</p>
<p>500 yards 6 minutes 16 and two-fifths seconds</p>
<p>Half mile 11 minutes 41 and one-fifth seconds</p>
<p>One mile 24 minutes 34 and three-fifths seconds</p>
<p>In addition, the following four records are about to be officially recognized:</p>
<p>500 meters 7 minutes 12 seconds</p>
<p>1,000 yards 13 minutes 23 and four-fifths seconds</p>
<p>1,000 meters 15 minutes 44 and four-fifths seconds</p>
<p>1,500 meters 23 minutes 44 and three-fifths seconds</p>
<p>On August 14, 1931, she created her best one-mile record of 23 minutes, 34 and three-fifths seconds at the Washington Sports Association Swimming Pool in her hometown of Seattle, exceeding the highest record held by Nippon, but this achievement could not be officially recognized because it was not produced during a formal competition. The one-mile record was originally held by McKay, who started in the state of Oxiphu on August 30, 1925, and was defeated by Miss Madison. Helen's greatest success was breaking the 1,500-yard record in San Francisco on September 13, 1931. The record was originally set by Gale Gen in New York on August 12, 1988, at 24 minutes, 29 and one-fifth seconds, while Miss Helen shortened the old record by 196 and one-fifth seconds, with her time being 21 minutes and 13 seconds.</p>

<p>Miss Helen has forgotten the circumstances of her first time learning to swim, but she still remembers the circumstances of her first time practicing "diving."</p>
<p>"I can always remember the circumstances of learning to dive," Helen said, "My mother encouraged, accompanied, and taught me to learn to swim, so that I could participate in swimming competitions and become a famous swimmer, to see my name in the swimming world in the Seattle newspapers, but I didn't want to learn at first, because I couldn't dive, my mother told me, "Diving is not difficult, as long as you jump correctly."</p>
<p>"At the time, there were many women who were very famous in the swimming world, but I couldn't measure how to move in the water, so I learned to dive when I was almost thirteen years old, and then I joined swimming competitions."</p>

<p>In 1927, Miss Madison participated in the swimming competition at the Seattle Youth Association Crystal Palace. Under the watchful eyes of the public, she finally won the championship in this swimming competition for about an hour. This was her first success, and she was praised as a young female swimmer, and it was also the success of her teacher Mr. Tu De's guidance. At this time, she was only a 14-year-old girl.</p>
<p>"Why don't you join our swimming team?" Mr. Tu De said to Helen like this, and Helen sympathized with his advice.</p>
<p>"When I first joined the swimming team, I was very scared, because everyone else was bigger than me and had better results than me," Helen thought to herself, "My results were very immature, but Mr. Tu De was very concerned about me. When the swimming preliminaries for the 1928 Olympic Games were held, all the blood vessels in my body were very tense, and I was very scared in my heart, because everyone was paying attention to such a young me, and I was also participating in the competition. Ah, I still can't understand why my immature results could attract people's attention. Mr. Tu De has been teaching me to swim since 1928, and he is the one who looks up to me the most.</p>

<p>Sayings of Old Man Ma Xiangbo at Ninety-Three</p>
<h3 id="e178">From Chickens, Cats, and Dogs to Resisting Hate Goods <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Lun Jiu</p>
<p>In large areas like Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it is said that there have recently been outbreaks of plague affecting chickens, dogs, and cats everywhere. Moreover, knife wounds and bloodstains have been found on these animals. The villagers are extremely frightened, and people say there are ghosts. Wherever the ghosts are, charms are used to ward them off, and wherever the charms fly, the plague spreads.</p>
<p>The plague among animals is associated with ghosts and charms, and from ghost drawings, I am reminded of a story from ancient Egypt. In ancient Egypt, there were many Jews, about five or six hundred thousand. The Egyptians became very afraid as the Jewish population increased day by day. Later, they devised various methods to mistreat them, and finally used secret and ruthless means to kill the firstborn sons of the Jews one by one, causing great alarm among the Jews living in Egypt. Fortunately, Moses emerged, and the Jews were saved.</p>
<p>Returning to the topic, if there really are ghosts who can draw charms, then Japanese goods are the charms. We are deluded by these charms, and the Japanese still want to kill us, causing families to be destroyed. This is entirely self-inflicted. However, knowing that these charms are the root of disaster, we still trust and believe in them. Where is our conscience? Especially those who traffic in hate goods, they only care about making money, knowing that these charm-like hate goods are enough to kill people, and they don't care. In my opinion, they are insane, and one day, the root of disaster will erupt, even more fiercely than the bomb in Hongkou Park.</p>
<p>I wonder, on the day when a bomb like the one in Hongkou Park is about to explode, where will these swaggering profiteers be?</p>
<h3 id="e179">Remembering Nie Zeng Jifen <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Many friends complain of poverty. When asked why, nineteen out of ten say it is due to the financial burden of their families. And the clothing and accessories of their wives and daughters account for most of it. A single pair of socks for the wife of an official costs twenty-five gold pieces, which could sustain a poor family of eight for a month. The country is in such chaos, and society is so unstable, yet many women are still indulging in a drunken stupor, competing with each other in clothing and accessories. If this continues, the nation will be doomed. Reading the "Thrift and Frugality to Save the Nation" essay, I feel that if every woman in China could be like Nie Zeng Jifen, there would be positive results after a few years. I can say this with certainty. Perhaps some readers do not know who Nie Zeng Jifen is. The reporter knows and is willing to introduce her. Nie Zeng Jifen is the second daughter of Zeng Guofan, a high-ranking official of the late Qing Dynasty. She was educated at home from a young age, learned to read, and was skilled in etiquette. Her son, Mr. Yuntai (the author of "Thrift and Frugality to Save the Nation"), was once quite famous. Now, he serves his mother with filial piety and believes in Buddhism, living quietly away from the world. The Nie family is a large and prominent one. Although Mrs. Nie is eighty years old and her family is not poor, she still wears simple clothes and eats plain food. In her spare time from managing household affairs, she holds family meetings every week to guide the family on what should be promoted and what should be changed. She also publishes the "Nie Family Sayings Monthly," which promotes thrift and encourages people to do good. In the cold season, she makes cotton clothes by hand to distribute to the poor. On Kunming Road, I once saw a dilapidated carriage, and it was Old Mrs. Nie going with her family to the nearby Guangzhong Dyeing and Weaving Factory to buy domestically produced cloth.</p>
<h3 id="e180">My Thoughts on Hen Shui <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Juan</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Henshui has lived in Peiping (Beijing) for a long time. Although he is originally from Anhui, he has become somewhat Peiping-ized. Last year, he moved to Dapenglan, where the courtyard and garden are neat and beautiful, with many flowers and trees. Henshui writes diligently there, and although it is hard work, he finds much comfort in spirit. Therefore, his literary talent grows higher and his works become more numerous. Who knew that he would recently encounter a great misfortune? That terrible scarlet fever actually came to oppose his literary work, cruelly taking away his two precious daughters, causing him to no longer have the heart to engage in writing. And letters urging him to submit manuscripts are still flying in like snowflakes, forcing him to the point where he wants to stop but cannot. He has no choice but to pick up his pen and reluctantly make a living from the old papers. Alas, this is truly a small tragedy in life. I think of Henshui and cannot help but sigh for my own hard work.</p>
<p>After finishing "Tears and Laughter," Henshui once visited Shanghai. We often spent time together, with banquets every evening. After exchanging pleasantries, I deeply understood that he was upright and straightforward, with the spirit of a person from the Qilu region (Shandong). And what I most identified with him was his love for watching movies. In his spare time from writing, he would sit high in the movie theater, enjoying the various scenes on the screen. I once said to him, "After reading your 'Tears and Laughter,' I knew you loved watching movies. Because your depiction of the characters' actions is very detailed, just like the attention to small actions in good movies. You can be considered a Lubitsch of the novel world!" Henshui was humble, but also regarded it as knowing his heart.</p>
<p>Henshui stayed in Shanghai for about a month and often went to the Mingxing Film Company to discuss the filming of "Tears and Laughter." He gathered many photographs of famous Peiping scenic spots for the Mingxing colleagues to use as reference. He also explained in detail the personalities and identities of the characters in the book. Before leaving, he was especially serious and repeatedly entrusted Du He with the task of writing the screenplay. At that time, they originally wanted to shoot a silent film, but the Mingxing colleagues, for the sake of perfection, specially purchased sound equipment from Hollywood, USA, to go to Peiping for on-site filming. Henshui did his best to help, and was extremely busy. Everyone spent endless effort, and now it has finally been completed. I heard from Du He that this film not only has sound but also color, and all the explanations are entirely his work. When it is released, it will surely cause a sensation. Unfortunately, Henshui is far away in Peiping and cannot enjoy a sneak peek. I predict that he will be very happy to receive this exciting news. But thinking of his personal misfortune, he cannot help but feel depressed, perhaps like the characters in "Tears and Laughter," feeling a mixture of tears and laughter.</p>
<h3 id="e181">World News in Brief <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>The Menu in the British Royal Palace: For those fortunate enough to enter Buckingham Palace and attend the receptions of the King and Queen of England, most are so overwhelmed by being in the presence of royalty that they are afraid of making a mistake and cannot eat anything. This is especially true for young women who are attending the palace for the first time. They are particularly restrained. However, the Green Drawing Room still provides food and drinks as usual. If they suddenly feel hungry, they can freely enjoy the following menu:</p>
<p>Chicken à la Maréchale, Jellied Lamb à la Maréchale, Savory Mince Rolls, Assorted Sandwiches, Mutton Patties, Fresh Fruit Desserts, Fresh Bayberry Jelly, Assorted Cakes, Orange Soda, Lemonade</p>
<p>Among them, mutton patties seem too common to be included in the royal menu. However, the mutton patties in Buckingham Palace are made with special care. They are only about the size of a man's pocket watch, melt in your mouth, and are exceptionally delicious. They are not available except during grand banquets in the palace. As for those who are thirsty, there is also a special department that provides tea and coffee, as well as brandy and whiskey soda. But everyone is too afraid to drink too much.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Xinghua Longan in the Mouths of Foreigners <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Yu</p>
<p>Standing atop the ancient and majestic city wall of Xinghua, we overlook the entire city, and what enters our eyes is like a large garden, so beautiful! This city in southern China is covered in a lush green color, with trees growing almost everywhere. Among these trees, most are longan trees, which Chinese people commonly call "dragon eye" trees. The cultivation of this fruit tree is a major source of wealth for the local people, and many people in Xinghua rely solely on this occupation to make a living. And the produced longan fruit is mostly sold in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In early summer, around May, visitors coming to Xinghua from elsewhere may vaguely recognize a few rare and exotic giant birds perched on many longan trees. But as soon as they run closer to the trees and look carefully, they will immediately discover that those climbing on the natural ladders formed by the branches are not really any giant birds, but gardeners carrying sickles.</p>
<p>In the eyes of others, their profession seems to carry a high degree of danger, especially in windy weather. However, the fact tells us that no one has ever heard the story of a gardener falling from a longan tree. These gardeners patiently bury themselves in their work on every branch, meticulously cutting down not only the dead branches, one by one</p>
<p>but also cutting off nearly half of the leaves and most of the flowers. Therefore, a pruned longan tree inevitably appears to have sparse leaves and scattered flowers. But without doing so, it is difficult to expect a full harvest in the autumn. In addition to pruning, considerable fertilizer is also required. It is necessary to apply manure about four times a year if you want the fruit to be of good quality.</p>
<p>In autumn, around August and September, the longans on the trees are all ripe. Clusters of brownish-yellow fruit hang on the branches, contrasting with the green leaves, so beautiful and lovely! Its taste is extremely delicious, with a special aroma that is exceptionally palatable, unmatched by any other fresh fruit. In the middle of the pulp is a black core, which Chinese people say looks like a dragon's eye, so they give this fruit another name, called "dragon eye." Although whether a dragon's eye really looks like this is still a question, it seems that no one dares to say for sure.</p>
<p>The wood of the longan tree is known for its hardness and durability, and the grain is smooth and delicate, very lovely. This wood is mostly used to make small tables, candle holders, or photo frames. The production of longan wood is extremely limited, because this tree grows very slowly, and its lifespan is particularly long. An ordinary longan tree can flower and bear fruit for about a hundred years. If it is specially cultivated, then it may be even longer.</p>

<p>— Zhang Mingqi</p>
<p>Zhang Jianbai (Mingqi) became a Juren (successful candidate in the imperial examinations). In less than ten years, he rose to become the Governor-General of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi). In the Qing Dynasty, the speed at which officials advanced was unparalleled. He was from Shandong. Initially, he was a tutor in the home of Yu Shouping (Chengge). He was dissolute and extravagant, and his clothes and belongings were all gone. His bedding was not washed for months. In the cold weather, he would sleep naked under the quilt. When guests came, he would talk eloquently. Every meal, the servants did not call him. Mingqi would enter the dining room himself. If he was late, he would not get food. He became accustomed to it. Chengge knew of this and wanted to humble him because of his arrogance. Mingqi also knew Chengge's intention, but he went his own way. The relationship between the host and guest was only outwardly harmonious. Eventually, he left. Through the introduction of his sister's husband, Xia Shuqing (Tongyi), he entered the staff of Cen Chunxuan. Chunxuan and Tongyi were classmates in the same year. They were close. Because of his affection for Tongyi, he also cared for Mingqi. He specially recommended him, saying that he had the talent to be of great use, claiming that he had the knowledge of Hu Linyi and the talent of Zuo Zongtang. He was specially granted the rank of Daotai and appointed as the Taiping-Sisun Daotai of Guangxi. At that time, Chunxuan was the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi. Cen Chi, a member of his staff, was most heavily relied upon by Chunxuan. Chunxuan was going to appoint Mingqi as the Salt Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi and consulted with Chi. Chi said, "Jianbai's talent is certainly sufficient to successfully complete the task. But he does not enjoy fame and fortune. I am afraid it is not what he desires. Your Excellency, decide for yourself." The matter was dropped. Mingqi heard about it, thanked Chi for understanding him, and said, "My ambition is the same as yours. I do not like official advancement." Later, he was promoted to Guangdong Treasurer. After Mingqi took office, he once said to someone, "Governor Yun forced me to do it. I could not refuse." Shortly after, Lin Shaonian, the Governor of Guilin, was transferred elsewhere. Chunxuan strongly recommended Mingqi to succeed him. It happened that Chengge opened a government office in Guilin. Mingqi was arrogant and did not show him respect. A certain county had a vacancy, and Chengge appointed a certain magistrate. Mingqi did not think it was right. He hung a plaque on the front door, reprimanding the Provincial Treasurer for being incompetent. Historically, there was never a Governor who could reprimand a Provincial Treasurer with a plaque. It started with Mingqi. Chengge could not bear it and tried to leave. Mingqi's father, a certain person, once served as the Assistant Magistrate of Xiangtan County in Hunan. Chengge's father, a certain person, once served as the Patrol Inspector of Wuxue in Hubei. Both were over seventy years old in Guilin and were very close. They once agreed to climb Duxiu Peak hand in hand. The people of Guilin had a saying about it: "The fathers get along well, the elders are admirable. The sons do not get along, the high officials are too difficult." It was a laughingstock at the time. When Emperor Xuantong ascended the throne, Mingqi entered the court. Knowing that a certain Governor of Guangdong was not tolerated by the court, he bribed influential officials to take his position. He was only thirty-seven years old. When the country changed, he was driven out by the party members. Because he had been an official in Lingnan for a long time, he gained the friendship of Cen Chunxuan's former subordinates, Long Jiguang and Lu Rongting. He approached them with humble words and generous gifts. The two of them recommended him to the government. Those around Yuan Shikai told him, "This person is a member of Cen's party or someone close to Cen. It is better to be careful." Shikai laughed and said, "This person has a craving for wealth and status. He is not happy without wealth and status. If I give him high office and special powers, and he does not betray Cen and come over to me, you can gouge out my eyes." So he made him Governor of Guangxi and then transferred him to Guangdong. During the Bingchen campaign, Chunxuan resisted Shikai very fiercely. He sailed to Guangdong, persuading Jiguang and Mingqi to raise troops to march north. Jiguang agreed in word only. Mingqi refused in stern tones, and secretly reported to Shikai, saying that Chunxuan was plotting rebellion. Only then did Chunxuan realize that Mingqi would not be attached and had reversed his previous behavior, repaying kindness with resentment. He was furious and wrote a long letter breaking off relations, publishing it in the newspapers to show the world. From this, it can be seen that Chunxuan knew Mingqi, but he did not really know Mingqi. The one who knew Mingqi best was Shikai. However, both Mingqi and Jiguang were driven out. Hongxian (Yuan Shikai's short-lived empire) eventually collapsed, which Chunxuan accomplished with the help of Rongting's troops.</p>

<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: Powerful Officials and Ethical Collapse Bully Others; Fortunately, There are Women to Comfort Them; A Shortcut to Bribery and Advancement; Appointing Bandit Leaders to Command</p>
<p>"If you just come back and complain to me, so that you don't get sick from bottling things up, I am willing to listen to you. But please don't lose heart or be discouraged. Don't be too sad and damage your body and spirit. You need to know that I have tried my best to get you out and about, simply to seek a common future happiness for you and me. If hope hasn't been achieved at all, and I have only added a lot of trouble for you in vain, think about how I can be at ease seeing this from the side. What hope will there be in the future? Yutian, I beg you, think of it as you loving me. Be more open about everything, and don't be so sad anymore." Originally, doing things in the world is the most difficult thing. Now you and I are also born at the wrong time, encountering such a most</p>
<p>evil society. No matter what you do or which path you take, it is absolutely impossible not to suffer or endure hardship. The only way is to apply flexible tactics, hold a strong will, strive outward, and be philosophical inward, to tread the path to success through difficulties and dangers. You are certainly very wronged now, but if you compare yourself to me, I used to mix from childhood to adulthood in that dark and dirty place. The anger I suffered and the hardships I endured were probably thousands of times deeper than yours. And I wasn't even cared for or pitied like you are today. You are a man, and you can't bear just this? How did I, a weak woman, survive before?" As she spoke, she who was advising others not to be sad was also moved by grief, her eyes reddened, and her heart soured. She suddenly felt that the edges of her eyelashes were also a little wet. She quickly tried her best to hold back, and simply leaned her delicate body over, dodging away from his cheek. With a pair of slender hands, she held onto An Yutian's shoulders, slightly lowering her head and directly staring at An Yutian's face. Those watery autumn waves, half sobbing and half extremely frivolous, said in a coquettish voice, "I don't allow you... you have to look at me... look at my face... don't be sad or angry anymore... how about it?... won't you quickly smile at me?" As she spoke, she shook her hands repeatedly, shaking An Yutian like a clapper. After all, An Yutian didn't have a heart of iron or a body of steel. He couldn't help but laugh out loud with a "chī pū" sound. He kept begging for mercy, saying, "I won't anymore." Instantly, the gloomy atmosphere in the room was dispelled by a burst of laughter and vanished into thin air.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange transactions in the market were quite prosperous in the morning, and the market sentiment was very firm. Therefore, the closing exchange rate continued to improve by about two cents compared to the previous day's high price, at 6 yuan, 9 fen, 7 li, 8 hao, and 7.5 hu. In the afternoon, due to a lull in activity, the situation weakened again. The closing price was 6 yuan, 9 fen, 7 li, and 2.5 hao, a drop of 6 hao and 2.5 hu. Judging from this, the market sentiment may have to decline again. The morning and afternoon interbank lending rates were both 8 fen, with an additional 4-5 fen added.

<h3 id="e187">Gold Bidding Resembles a Subdued Market Trend <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The forward contracts were offered by short sellers at around ten taels. Yesterday's gold bidding seemed to have slightly fallen. Because the forward period started, the exchange opened early. However, all firms had already traded before 8 o'clock, with the short sellers offering the contracts, initially at eight taels, then ten taels. When the official price was posted, it was ten taels and one qian. Later, due to support from long sellers such as Qian Changxiang and the Dalian Gang (acting for Yufeng Yongmou Firm), it gradually increased, with the highest price being twelve taels. But because Dadecheng and zero-lot traders were short sellers, more contracts were offered, and the price was reduced to eight taels and four or five qian. Afterwards, it was around ten taels. It was heard that it trended smaller in the afternoon, within nine taels. However, some firms had not yet completed their forwards. All transactions for July were canceled, and all were changed to the August period. However, the opening price was 733 taels and 6 qian, and the closing price was 35 taels and 5 qian, slightly more than 5 qian from the previous day. This was changed according to the August posting price. The posting price was subsequently canceled.</p>
<p>The August market was very ordinary. Yesterday, the August market opened, but there were no large new transactions among the brokers. Because the forward period had just passed, the market sentiment seemed hesitant. Throughout the day, it only fluctuated around five taels. In the end, it fell by about one or two taels. Although the silver market shrank, it was not affected. The European market was stable. The opening price was slightly soft. Afterwards, due to forward fluctuations, the exchange rate strengthened and recovered. As a result, the market situation slightly improved. In the later market, there seemed to be more sellers. In the end, it was calculated to be between 725 taels. The details of the previous and subsequent markets are recorded below. The market fluctuated due to forwards in the morning. The August market opened at 8 a.m. at 723 taels and 5 qian, with the major dealers slightly falling by one-sixteenth. The silver price, both official and private, was slightly lower by one-eighth, so it failed to rise. Soon after, Dadecheng, Wupin, Hengxingyuan, and others entered the market, immediately rising four taels, to twenty-seven taels and five qian. Hengyu, Bingxing, Yuhe, Shunli, Wanxing came out, retreating two taels, to twenty-five taels and five qian. A while later, Yifengyong, Yiyu, Zhifengyong, Richang, Yifeng, Yuantai, and others all entered, especially with forwards increasing to eleven or twelve taels. Also, Mitsui first absorbed August US dollars at 30.75, and Huabi and others issued the current month at half a yuan, and July at 5.5625. The firms closed in, so at 8:30, it was 28 taels and 4 qian. Afterwards, the firms' entries and exits were uneven. Yuanmaoyong, Yuandayong, and Daxingyong all exited, while Qianchangxiang and Yuanxingyong entered, so the market price fluctuated by two taels. Until 9 o'clock, the forwards decreased slightly, and Richang, Xixingyong, Tongtaichang, Bingxing, Qianchangxiang, Yuanmaoyong, and the Dalian Gang all divested, further reducing the exchange rate. Huabi exited July at 75, and HSBC exited October English gold at 1.875, so the price plummeted by four taels. At 9:30, an order was issued not to change, at 24 taels and 5,qian. Later, Maixing absorbed October US dollars at 1.875, and also hedged the current month English gold at 1.80625, and Xixingyong, Hongkangyong, Yuhe, Yifeng, Yifengyong, Bingxing, and others entered the market, causing the price to rise by two taels. At 10:15, it was 26 taels and 4 qian, but the ups and downs were only a few qian to one tael. At 10:30, it was 25 taels and 2 qian again. Afterwards, it stood at around 26 taels, but the English gold was still stable. The firms hedged September at .0625, and the current month at 8 pence. Shuer Shang, Yuhe, Tongfu, Hongkangyong, and Dadecheng all entered. At 11:10, it was 26 taels and 8 qian. Soon after, there seemed to be more sellers, and the hedgers sold, retreating another tael. The afternoon closed at 25 taels and 8 qian, with the posted price still calculated at 797 taels, a discount of 71 taels.</p>
<p>The firms sold off slightly in the later market. The afternoon opened at 25 taels and 2 qian. Neixing sold, and it became 24 taels and 6 qian. However, Xixingyong, Richang, and Yuanyong entered the market. Also, Maijiali, Shanghai, and HSBC bought October US dollars at 1.875, and also hedged July at .6875, so the market sentiment rose, increasing by more than one tael. At 2:40, it was 26 taels and 2 qian. After that, the state was mediocre, with only four or five qian ups and downs. The firms' transactions were also few. Until near 4 o'clock, Yuanmaoyong, Dalian Gang, Zhifengyong, Futaiheng, and others sold off. There were also telegrams saying that the warring countries could not repay their debts, so the market price secretly fell by more than one tael. At 4:12, it was 24 taels and 5 qian. Zero-lot traders entered, at 25 taels and 2 qian. At 4:30, the market closed at 24 taels and 7 qian. Subsequently, it traded up to 25 taels and 5 qian. Wupin made a large profit of 8 qian. According to the daily range, the highest was 728 taels and 4 qian, and the lowest was 723 taels and 5 qian, a difference of 4 taels and 9 qian. The posted price was calculated to be 712 taels. The ledger recorded 36 taels for both June and July, 26 taels for August, and a premium of 36 taels. The afternoon was 35 taels, and the bare bullion increased by 16 taels (due to the forward).</p>
<p>The trading volume was not large after the forward period. According to the tree surface trading statistics, Dadecheng, Yifeng, Yifengyong, Yiyu, Xixingyong, Richang, Bingxing, Yuhe, and Hongkangyong all entered. Yuantai also entered. Zhifengyong, Shunli, Yuanmaoyong, Futaiheng, and Daxingyong all exited. In the afternoon, Xixingyong and Yuanxingyong acted as old longs for a certain firm. Bingxing and Yuantai all exited. Futaiheng, Wanxing, Shunli, Dadecheng, Yuanmaoyong, Zhifeng, etc., entered and exited from time to time. The Dalian Gang exited a total of more than 700 contracts and bought about 300 contracts. The Guang Gang's entries and exits were balanced, and about 500 or 600 contracts were entered.</p>
<h3 id="e188">No Major Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market continued to decline, with exchange rates for British pounds slightly up, U.S. dollars up significantly, and European markets stable. The Shanghai market also saw no major changes. HSBC's listed rate only increased by one yuan for French francs, and the Yokohama Specie Bank's rate increased by half a tael. Other rates remained unchanged, suggesting that bank quotations initially stabilized after opening, returned to equilibrium at noon, and remained stable in the afternoon. The price of gold was also relatively stable, with daily fluctuations not exceeding five taels, indicating a weakening trend. Despite the presence of swaps, pressure from multiple parties pushed the opening price above ten taels. By the evening market, the ratio of British gold to U.S. dollars was slightly higher by 0.0625 compared to the previous noon, while the U.S. dollar was also higher by 0.0625. However, due to forward adjustments, it actually decreased by 0.0625. Trading among Chinese merchants was not quiet, generally buying in, with occasional sales of gold. It is estimated that British gold transactions amounted to over 100,000 pounds. HSBC and Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (BBB) sold short positions, while U.S. dollar transactions totaled 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, with more buying than selling, and BBB accounting for most of the sales. The closing prices for today's transactions are recorded below:</p>
<p>British Exchange Rate: Internal trading fluctuated by no more than 0.0625 throughout the day.

<h3 id="e189">Large Silver Bars Remain Stable <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 16th reported that large silver bars were stable, with a closing price of 16 7/8 pence for the near term and 16 7/8 pence for the long term, unchanged from the previous day. The London to New York exchange rate opened at $3.6675.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Securities and Bond Markets Continue to Weaken <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Moderate fluctuations with over 4.5 million in transactions. Yesterday (the 16th), the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw various bond market conditions. Although several spot bonds opened, trading was sparse, with only 20,000 yuan transacted throughout the day. The forward market remained as before, with market activity mainly driven by retail trading. The total turnover in the morning and afternoon was 4,575,000 yuan, including over 800,000 yuan each for Consolidated Tax and 2.5% Customs Bonds, and approximately 500,000 yuan each for 1920 Customs Bonds and 20% Salt Revenue Bonds. Bonds for disbandment and troop reduction were relatively stable, while 96 Customs Bonds and 6% Customs Bonds remained very scarce. As for the price movements of various bonds, the active retail selling in the market caused prices to continue to hover and weaken. The initial opening in the morning saw slight fluctuations compared to the previous day, but prices gradually trended lower afterward. However, the fluctuations remained moderate, as the overall environment was calm. Only retail investors needed funds for near-term settlements and sold slightly. Major investors remained calm, and there was still considerable demand in the market. Therefore, prices are expected to remain weak within the month and are unlikely to improve. Market conditions are also not expected to recover in the short term. The price movements of various bonds yesterday are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e191">New York Stock Market Gradually Recovering <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Banking Corporation)</p>
<p>The New York stock market on Wednesday continued the gains from the previous day, with the market trending upward throughout the session. This was due to calm news in the industrial sector and the sharp rise in wheat prices and continued gains in sugar prices, which greatly encouraged sentiment, leading to rapid increases. Towards the end of the session, some investors took profits, causing prices to fall back, but the closing price was still significantly higher than the previous day. A total of 1.2 million shares were traded throughout the day, indicating that various trends are gradually recovering. Business news remains extremely bleak, and it is reported that the industry currently faces many economic and political difficulties. Last week's production rate reached only 18%. Based on the overall situation, the stock market is still expected to perform well in the short term. The Dow Jones Index for Wednesday is attached below:</p>
<p>|                          | June 14   | June 15   | Change  |</p>

<h3 id="e192">Slight Improvement in Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market rose in the morning but weakened at noon due to the rebound in U.S. cotton prices. As the local market had already fallen for several days, a reaction occurred, improving sentiment. Some profit-takers took the opportunity to sell short, leading to a slight improvement in the market. However, the situation in the interior remains bleak, with people's livelihoods deteriorating, rampant banditry, and severe financial constraints, resulting in weak purchasing power. Consequently, some factories are facing difficulties with inventory. Therefore, the market situation recently has been weaker than the cotton market.</p>
<p>Man-Marked Cotton Rises and Falls Again: The Man-Marked cotton market opened higher following the increase in U.S. cotton prices, rising by 1.56 taels. The second and third sessions were flat. In the afternoon, market sentiment weakened again, and some selling occurred, causing prices for each month to fall by 0.06 to 0.07 taels. Total trading volume for the day was 32,300 bales. Sales included 1,650 bales of Jifeng, 1,800 bales of Yuande, 900 bales of Senkang, and 700 bales of Yichang. Purchases included 1,050 bales of Gengfeng, 1,000 bales of Changfeng, 600 bales of Xincheng, and 650 bales of Tongxing. The closing prices for Man-Marked cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>| Man-Marked Closing | Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|---------------------|--------|-----------------|</p>
<p>| October 14.54       | Up 0.85| 4,250            |</p>

<p>| September 14.51     | Up 0.74| 4,500           |</p>
<p>Spot Sales Increase Slightly: Spot yarn sales were higher than the previous day. Total purchases by various guilds for the day were estimated at 700 bales. Customers from Zhenjiang purchased 15 bales, Sichuan purchased 450 bales, Guangdong purchased 75 bales, Changsha purchased 135 bales, the interior purchased 75 bales, Ningbo purchased 10 bales, Luzhou purchased 55 bales, Shantou purchased 25 bales, Xiamen purchased 10 bales, the Northern Guild purchased 5 bales, and fellow merchants purchased 60 bales. Market conditions were generally stable.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Strong Cotton Rebound <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market trended firmer due to the rebound in U.S. cotton prices, and sentiment in Shanghai had already sensed a turnaround. Furthermore, the Ningbo Guild, which had previously sold short over 10,000 piculs due to the sharp price drop in that area and a lack of buyers, today covered the previous short positions in full, further intensifying the upward trend. However, based on actual observations, there is no extreme upward momentum. The recent sharp decline has simply led to a rapid rebound. It is estimated that the raw materials purchased by various factories are sufficient to meet demand for eight to nine months. Consequently, cotton inventories in Shanghai's warehouses are gradually increasing. According to a survey by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., the inventory of American cotton in Shanghai is over 151,000 bales.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Continues to Rise by 0.07 Taels: The Standard Cotton market opened higher following the rebound in U.S. cotton prices, with an increase in buyers in the market, creating a tighter situation. Prices for each month rose by 0.06 to 0.07 taels. The afternoon opening was flat, falling by 0.03 to 0.04 taels, and then rising by 0.02 taels in the second and third sessions. Total trading volume for the day was 93,500 piculs. Sales included 7,200 piculs of Gengfeng, 1,600 piculs of Tongyu, 2,100 piculs of Xincheng, 2,300 piculs of Yifeng, and 2,300 piculs of Tongxing. Purchases included 5,800 piculs of Suilong, 7,600 piculs of Yuchang, and 3,000 piculs of Changfeng. The closing prices for Standard Cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>| Standard Cotton Closing| Change | Open Interest |</p>
<p>|-----------------------|--------|-----------------|</p>
<p>| October 29.40         | Up 0.07| 133,100         |</p>
<p>| July 28.60            | Up 0.07| 59,800          |</p>
<p>| November 29.60        |        | 137,900         |</p>
<p>| August 28.95          | Up 0.075| 105,100         |</p>
<p>| Total                |        | 436,100         |</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Mills Should Eliminate Waste: The spot cotton business remains stagnant. Factories are satisfied with imported cotton, so business intentions remain sluggish.</p>

<p>Excessive Rainfall...Traders Buy In: Yesterday, U.S. cotton rose due to excessive rainfall. Traders bought in, and there was a shortage of sellers, resulting in a quiet but firm market. Futures rose by 12 to 14 points, and spot prices rose by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 2 to 3 points, and spot prices rose by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. Indian cotton was firm due to positive news from Liverpool. Ginned Bengal rose by 5.75 rupees, and Rohilkhand White rose by 6 rupees.

<p>(Tianjin Dispatch) The cotton market in the Xibeihe District of Tianjin on June 10th continued its downward spiral and did not show signs of stability. Japanese merchants and importers did not expand their operations. Matsumoto &amp; Co. purchased 100 bales, opening at 23.5 taels, while Qingxi &amp; Co. purchased 260 bales, opening at 23 taels.</p>
<p>(Tianjin Market) On June 10th, cotton yarn transactions remained sporadic and the market remained weak. The Wolugu Guild purchased 32-count Colorful Ball Yarn at 188.5 taels, and the Gaoyang Guild purchased 32-count Blue Phoenix Yarn at 175 taels.</p>

<p>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factories Initiate Sales to Europe. British and French Firms Negotiate Large Spot Transactions Yesterday. The Shanghai foreign silk market has been weak and stagnant due to overseas silk sales. Recently, orders for autumn silk from Marseille, Lyon, and other places have increased, and there has been a sudden demand for raw silk. Sin孚, 連納, 達昌 and other firms have received overseas telegrams requesting the purchase of current white factory silk. British firms are also interested, so they have invited various manufacturers to negotiate. The sales volume for upper and middle grade silk is estimated to be over 200 bales. Once negotiations are completed, the transactions can be recorded, and the price of silk is expected to increase by dozens of taels. The market has suddenly become active.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Slight Movement in Keemun Black Tea Sales to England <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign tea market saw Keemun black tea sales. British firms such as Tien Yu, Jin Long, Ewo, and Dodwell began to take action. A total of over 500 chests were negotiated throughout the city. High-grade tea from Qi Nan was offered at 144 taels, while medium- and low-grade tea was sold at 60-70 taels. Market prices were 20-30 taels higher than before. The green tea market remained sluggish. There were no transactions for Wuyuan Tunxi Zhenmei. Only Zhenmei and Xiumei had some sales, and the market situation remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Grains: Rice Market Gradually Loosening</p>
<p>Shanghai South: Yesterday, approximately 20 boats from various guilds arrived, but warehouse inventory remains abundant. Retail sales in urban and rural stores are watching for sunny weather. Moreover, accumulated inventory is gradually increasing, and the price of foreign rice is falling daily, making people feel tired. The fresh Hougeng market saw a slight decrease in price. The Zhongguan甩 declined by 0.2-0.3 taels. The market for Baodao rice remained unchanged among customers. The market for short rice declined by 0.1-0.2 taels. The market for Luxiangjian and Bian Yuan rice saw sporadic movement, with nearly 100 piculs changing hands and prices decreasing slightly.</p>
<p>Shanghai North: Yesterday, approximately 30 rice boats from Changzhou, Wuxi, and Xianzi arrived in the Zhabei rice market. Changzhou Su Baijeng rice was scarce and sales were weak, and the market was gradually declining. Transactions for rice from Kunshan, Jiangyin, and Yixing were extremely light, with prices decreasing by 0.2 taels. Early Baodao rice saw slight demand from tea shops, with an opening price of 0.15 taels less. Bian Yuan rice saw no gain or loss.</p>
<h3 id="e198">3,000 Bags of Wenzhou Rice Newly Arrived <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Rice Continues to Fall by 0.15 Taels: Continued Inquiries from Jiangbei in the Interior. Yesterday, the foreign rice and Kejian markets both showed weakness. Because many boats arrived downstream, Tu rice first weakened, and Kejian followed. Yesterday, 3,000 bags of new Wenzhou rice arrived, but no buyer opened a sale. Ke Yuan also had Jiangxi arrivals, but although the quantity was not large, the market was also weak. Yesterday, only 38 bags of Jiangxi Ji Yuan were opened, with a price of 14.4 yuan, about 0.2 yuan less than the price at the beginning of the week.</p>
<p>Foreign rice inventory is very sufficient and continues to arrive recently. Yesterday, it was reported that 5 million bags of Siamese rice were arriving, making people feel weaker and prices decreasing by 0.15 taels. No. 1 Saigon was opened at 300 bags with a price of 11.55 yuan, and Xiao Jiao was opened at 3,200 bags with a price of 10.17 to 10 yuan. The Si Gong rice was handled by the local street, while the Xiao Jiao rice was packaged by Jiangbei's local guilds. The report that 5 million bags of Luo rice were exported and 2 million bags have already arrived refers to the entire Chinese market. Because the Siamese rice stored in Shanghai does not exceed 10,000 bags and the number of bags that have not arrived are also limited, the large amount of imports are to Liangguang and the southern provinces.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Difficulty in Reversing the Flour Market <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of each month initially stabilized. Because the price of foreign wheat rebounded by about 0.3-0.4 yuan, the opening price was about 0.01 yuan higher than the previous day. However, after the second session, because actual sales were still sluggish and there was no movement, trading was rare, and the market trended dull again. When the afternoon market opened, trading in each month was very rare. Customers' minds were not active. The major factories were still hesitating between selling and not selling. Because there were very few buyers, it was useless to sell, so they were still observing. However, small factories released some sales. In the future, the market must be active in the north before it can improve. As a result, July was unchanged from the previous day, August, September, and October decreased by 0.025 yuan, and November decreased by 0.075 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Period Wheat is Close to a Distant Drop <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of period wheat, the price of foreign wheat rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan and due to the remaining trend from the previous day, people were still in a good mood. The opening price for July was 2.6 yuan, and the opening price for August was 3.6 yuan. However, the situation in the border area was still not good, and the current wheat price was very cheap. The Jiangnei gangs were all paying attention to throwing it out, so they used the current price to throw out the period. There were profits to be made, so it turned flat again. When the afternoon market opened, July seemed to be stable, but the market for August and below was sluggish due to the Jiangnei gangs gradually issuing sales, and the market declined step by step. Looking at the future, it is temporarily considered a distant drop. As a result, July was 0.01 yuan better than the previous day, August and September fell by 0.02 yuan, October fell by 0.05 yuan, and November fell by 0.04 yuan. The market for the current wheat saw an influx of arrivals, and the factory's taste was flat. Yesterday, 300 bags of Qishuyan Gaomai were opened, with a price of 2.92 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e201">New Shrimp and Dried Squid Arrive, Sales are Weak <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Ningbo Dried Squid: The new batch of dried squid has arrived in large quantities. According to statistics, the total amount received is over 10,000 piculs. Therefore, the price has continued to decline. The price for first-class goods is 27 taels, high-quality goods are 21 taels, ordinary goods are 20 taels, and lower-quality goods are 18-19 taels. Although the market price has fallen, sales are still very sluggish. Most of the goods that have arrived are sitting in warehouses. The industry wants to sell quickly, but there are no people asking about it. If sales do not increase, there is little hope of a rebound.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Dried Longan (Guìyuán) from North and South is Weak Due to Sluggish Sales <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Dried Longan (Guìyuán) sales are abnormally weak as the season approaches mold. Although market inventory is not thick, demand is low, prices are falling repeatedly, and there are hopes for a bumper harvest of new Guiyuan from various production areas, so it is difficult to improve market prices. It is reported that recently, the numbers have been continuously opening, and the price has dropped. It is reported that it is seven or eight taels different from the high price.</p>
<h3 id="e203">All Piece Goods (Pǐtóu) Fall, both Domestic and Foreign <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Piece goods (Pǐtóu) cloth have been falling for days, and customer sales are experiencing a shortage. While foreign cotton markets are falling sharply, and cotton yarn has been shaken by them, piece goods are being greatly affected. The decline recently has been greater than ever before. Coarse cloth of 16 pounds has fallen four to five cents per piece. Ewo's double elephant opened yesterday at only 7 taels, causing the prices of Dasheng and Qingfeng factories to be exceptionally chaotic. 9-pound cloth for Ewo once opened at 3.95 taels, but the market had to be four taels in the afternoon. Fine cloth and fine twill are more vulnerable and have fallen below 7 taels. In fact, the price of yarn has fallen sharply, and the Japanese factory goods are moving again. Most of the customers are waiting and watching, so the supply exceeds the demand. Western goods calling firms have opened for auction as usual, but there are more falls than rises. It is feared that the summer goods will not be sold out. After one look, the goods were still in loss. Blue striped rush cloth is falling, and it is difficult to sell at 1.8 cents. White striped rush cloth is still hard. Rush cloth has also fallen, and Deji Huang Tianbao sold 1.8 cents yesterday. Taisi, Yuan Yuchou, had already started in previous years, but remains unchanged this year.</p>

<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Our country's authorities are now talking a lot about the issue of resuming diplomatic relations with Russia. They have decided on two principles and two steps, but under the current circumstances, whether Soviet Russia is willing to resume diplomatic relations with our country is also a question.</p>
<p>For example, if I go to a park to pursue a woman, whether the woman is willing to accept my pursuit is also a question. Perhaps she dislikes that I am old, or perhaps she dislikes that I am not handsome. This kind of pursuit is called "one-sided love." Even if she accepts, or if it is only for friendship and she is unwilling to sacrifice her beauty, it is also "lovers are hard to become family members." Now, it is a question whether our country should resume diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia. It is also a question whether Soviet Russia is willing to resume diplomatic relations with us. After resuming diplomatic relations, it is also a question whether Soviet Russia is willing to sacrifice its beauty for us. Firstly, Japan, having heard news of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia (not necessarily seen in the newspaper), has already planned to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and Russia, and our country has followed suit. Secondly, before Soviet Russia's new five-year plan is successful, it does not seem willing to start a war with Japan. Even if diplomatic relations are resumed, it would be useless.</p>
<p>According to a previous telegram from a Japanese newspaper, "Russia does not seem as eager as before to immediately engage in trade and send envoys, but if China is eager for the Chinese and Russian governments to restore diplomatic relations, their country is also willing to talk." According to this news, it can be seen that Soviet Russia has no sincerity in resuming diplomatic relations with our country. Firstly, it says, "If China is eager," and secondly, it says, "Also willing to talk." Its cold and insincere attitude is already implied. According to yesterday's news from Beijing, the disclosure of the resumption of diplomatic relations too early has caused misunderstandings with the other party, and it is now planned to proceed with another method, which is like Mr. Luo's saying, "One leak will lead to failure," isn't it? This is called "blaming the knife grinder instead of blaming the murderer."</p>

<p>Mourning the former garden in May, the desolate home country is not as before. Fearing to hear the day the puppet takes the stage, it is the year of mourning for the four classes of people.</p>

<p>— Tang Sicheng</p>
<p>Photographic platemaking is one of the applications of chemistry. Taking negatives is the most important thing. However, the old habits of Chinese people emphasize penmanship and regard retouching as the most important thing. They do not pay attention to chemical effects and platemaking principles. Isn't this abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial? This is also one of the reasons why platemaking has not progressed. Now, let's try to outline the method of making a lead plate by frosted glass photography on the left.</p>
<p>(1) If you want to make seven colors for a color original, you should first use a color separation filter to take a yellow, red, blue, and black version of each sheet with a color separation dry plate. This kind of technology can be done by those who understand the dry plate, photography, developing, and printing.</p>

<p>— Benben</p>
<p>"Ah, got opium dross..." A sallow-faced, narrow-shouldered, registered vagrant old man, carrying a woven straw bag with straps on his shoulder, dragging a pair of broken shoes with worn-out heels, listlessly wandered through the alley, chanting the above slogan. When he started calling out, his lips, flapping up and down, revealed his unique trademark: opium dross. Compared to the Misses' lipstick, it seemed even more brightly colored and eye-catching. This was not only his trademark but also, perhaps, the natural machine that demonstrated the sole test of his merchandise. Driven by life and to meet the needs of the lower class of registered vagrants in modern society, he had come to engage in this occupation outside of the 360 traditional trades.</p>
<p>Before long, his slogan prompted someone to call out, "Selling opium dross!" Hearing that business was coming, he immediately ran up to make contact with unsteady steps.</p>
<p>"How much is this bag worth?" A young woman with a sleepy look, wearing embroidered slippers, asked the price.</p>
<p>The old man took a look at the opium dross, then stuffed some into his natural machine to test its potency as part of his inspection process. After finishing the appraisal, he said, "Two hundred coppers."</p>
<p>"No, no, you don't know the goods. Look closely, this is raw opium! Do you think it's bad stuff? I want to sell it for four hundred coppers!"</p>
<p>"Oh dear! Small business, small profit, can't budge that much. Be reasonable, I'll add five coppers,"</p>
<p>"At least three hundred and fifty, not a copper less. I'd rather not sell it," the young woman said firmly.</p>
<p>"First deal of the day, doesn't count. I'll add three more, okay?"</p>
<p>"I said three hundred and fifty, not a copper less. If you don't want it, no problem," the young woman said, picking up the opium dross from the ground and walking away.</p>
<p>"Ah! You rich people can afford raw opium, yet you haggle over two coppers like it's so important. I won't make any profit, fine, fine, fine, three hundred and fifty it is!" Hearing the old man agree to her request, the young woman immediately turned around with a smile, handed the bag of opium dross to the old man, and paid the exact amount. In the end, they completed the transaction.</p>
<p>As the old man walked out of the alley, he thought to himself, "These people really don't understand. If they're so stingy, then how can they afford raw opium that costs thousands of dollars per ounce? Since such expensive raw opium doesn't make them flinch, then why do they haggle over these two coppers like it's life or death? Could it be that two coppers are more valuable than raw opium that costs thousands of dollars per ounce? Ah! This is truly called 'Short measure, generous yard, don't count the acre.'"</p>

<h3 id="e208">The Tailor's Apprentice <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>Agou was twelve years old. All day long, he played riding imaginary horses and rolling copper coins under the oxcart shed with the neighborhood children. Agou's parents were busy with farm work and had no time to discipline their son.</p>
<p>One day, Agou's godmother came to visit his parents. Seeing that Agou was more intelligent and lively than before, she said to him with a smile, "Would you like me to take you to Shanghai to play?" Of course, the child was so happy that he clung to his godmother and wouldn't leave her side. So, the "going to Shanghai to play" was not an empty promise. His godmother's godson ran a clothing store in Shanghai. With the permission of Agou's parents, his godmother recommended him to work as an apprentice in the clothing store.</p>
<p>In the first few days, Agou did nothing but sweep the floor, wipe the tables, and other trivial tasks. In his spare time, he enjoyed looking at the street scenes of Shanghai, which were much more interesting than the rice paddies and oxcart sheds of his village. However, as the weather gradually became hotter, the apprentices had no beds and slept on the floor. Bedbugs disturbed his sleep, and his chubby limbs became covered with red bumps.</p>
<p>Because business was good when making summer clothes, the store hired additional master tailors. Agou was assigned the additional task of cooking porridge in the morning. While the master tailors worked, they instructed him to fan them, which he secretly thought was the best job since coming to the store. Because he would work up a sweat cooking porridge in the morning, and then work up another sweat cooking lunch, with this back and forth with the heat and cold, Agou had become much thinner by the end of the summer.</p>
<p>When the master tailor had his second son, Agou, like a servant, was also responsible for washing diapers. After finishing their meal, the master tailor's wife would go play mahjong, leaving the child in his care. Thus, Agou was busier than anyone else.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Agou had been at the store for almost a year. On a snowy morning, he took a basket to buy groceries (this was another newly added task). After returning, he made tea, washed vegetables... The seasons continued to pass, and Agou's workload only increased.</p>
<p>During the New Year, Agou's mother came from the countryside to see him. She was shocked at how much thinner Agou had become. Agou also cried and wanted to go back home. Fortunately, the master tailor granted him permission to return to his hometown. (That is, the master tailor gave him two yuan for shoes and socks.)</p>
<p>Agou went back to playing imaginary horses with the neighborhood children under the oxcart shed! After working as a tailor's apprentice for a year, he had never held a needle or thread. Therefore, Agou still doesn't understand how a piece of cloth becomes a piece of clothing.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>I have recently been interested in researching small crafts, so I have collected many books on this subject. The science column of your newspaper is of particular interest to me. Unexpectedly, Mr. Qing Jun's article yesterday on "Methods for Manufacturing Several Daily Necessities" was actually plagiarized from the book "Methods for Manufacturing Daily Necessities" published by the Chung Hwa Book Company. It is unfortunate that your newspaper published this type of manuscript. I hope you will pay attention to this in the future.</p>
