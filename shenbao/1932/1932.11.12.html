<h3 id="c1">如何紀念孫中山先生誠 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>今日爲孫中山先生之誕辰。舉國都集會紀念。比偉大之革命導師與手創民國之國父。偉矣先生崇高之人格與隆盛之勳業。實已永鐫於全國人民之心曲。</p>
<p>雖然。吾人將謂低首默念。背誦先生之遺囑。與夫講述先生之事業。遂足以紀念先生乎。此種形式上之紀念。絕不足以紀念先生。吾人認爲紀念先生。應在於認淸先生偉大之人格與革命之精神。秉承先生之遺訓。以實踐之行動。實現先生之遺志。幷以完成先生未竟之事業。</p>
<p>中山先生畢生之事業。厥爲革命。爲基於民衆之立塲。爲民衆之利益。作堅苦之奮鬭。其遺留之主義爲民族民權。而歸結於民生。就可知解除人民之疾苦。俾民生安定。乃爲先生畢生奮鬭之鵠的。吾人今日紀念先生。則應問人民之疾苦已解除未。民生已安定未。如其未也。則吾人今日與其作形式上之紀念。母寗以實踐之行動。努力實現先生之遺志。此其一。</p>
<p>其次。中山先生之人格。爲偉大。爲崇高。而其襟懷之空闊。更有如海闊如天空。大公無我。舍己爲人。其遺訓「天下爲公」四字。實即爲先生偉大人格之結晶。惟公故明。爲大故能容納萬彙其待人也寛。律己也嚴。指導人民而不君臨人民。故能博得人民之信仰與崇敬。吾人今日紀念先生。則應問吾人是否能本「天下爲公」之義。犧牲小我。容納大多數人之意見。以全民族之利益爲前提。公黨於國。俾黨能與人民打成一片。如其未也。則吾人今日與其徒作形式之紀念。母寗效法中山先生。實踐「天下爲公」之旨。以此救黨。幷以救國。此其二。</p>
<p>總之。先生之勳業與人格。已最存於吾人之記憶。與日月共其光輝。如曰紀念。則惟有秉承先生之贵遺敎。作實踐之行動。吾人謹以此意獻諸黨中領袖。幷以獻諸全體國民。</p>

<p>主席陳鶴琴報告十時起振鈴開會、行禮如儀由主席陳鶴琴、致詞略謂、今天中華兒童敎育社、舉行第三届年會、有如此盛大的會同人非常高興本社於民國十八年七月在杭州西湖博覺會、舉行成立大會、出席祇四十餘人但是在舉行成立會之前、本社已具雛行、在南京方面、有幾位從事幼稚敎育的同志、已有研究的結合、至十九年、在無錫舉行第一届年會出席者已較成立會時多、那時候在船上開會討論一切、大家興趣盎然、及第二次年會在上海舉行因交通便利故出席者竟達四百餘人、此次是第三届年會、出席人數尙無正確統計至社内現在情形、個人社員有八百餘人、團體會員有三十五個、我們是很抱樂觀本届年會展覽健康敎育成績、因爲平時一般的家庭中、未能注意到兒童的健康、所以本社要把努力提倡健康的責任負起來、至於本社事業的進展、一則以喜、一則以懼、所喜的是社務的發展所懼的是外界希望太大、我輩責任太重、本席代表同仁向來賓道歉、</p>
<p>▲馬客談報告籌備經過略云、三届年會本定在今年四月間舉行、因滬戰改期、本届年會地點在上届年會决定在南京舉行、其意義有二、㈠是南京有很多新的建設、可以於開會之外、發現新的見聞、㈡是南京方面學校、多可以招待週到但是事實上籌備不很週到、還望原諒、</p>
<p>▲敎部代表吳研因致詞敎育部對於兒童敎育方面、工作報告一下敎部有普通敎育司、成立迄今、已逾四年、司内之第二科、專司初等敎育事宜、最近已將小學課程標準、除公民訓練標準尙待整理外、其餘均已公佈、而此項標準之成功、仍希賴於兒童敎育社社員之贊助、其他正在實在實施的、是義務敎育編有第一期短期義務敎育實施大綱、分發各省市令、卽設立義務敎育實騐區、以爲張本、未來的工作擬註定各種敎具校具的標準、仍望社員多多的贊助、敎育部業於兒敎社、有三點希望、㈠社會上對兒童敎育有誤解的希望、社員多多研究、使社會明白兒童本位敎育的意義、㈡使社會上明白兒童敎育的重要、㈢我們要從研究兒童敎育、找到救國的出路、社員的本身、是努力兒童敎育的、同時要指導社外從事兒童敎育的同志、共同進行、有人反對兒童本位敎育以爲這是浪漫的放任的、實在錯誤的、在三民主義中、就很注意到兒童個性、民權中的平等、就是平脚、不是平頭、所以我們要努力於矯正一般的錯誤、</p>
<p>▲衛生署代表金楚珍致詞本届年會討論的目標是健康敎育、故衛生署方面、極願加入、署方很願爲衛生敎育做事、編訂各種衛生敎材敎具以及衛生設備等、並曾派員到歐美去考察衛生設備及行政、以期歸國後實施、深望諸位多多指敎、</p>
<p>▲中央大學代表黃建中致詞本人今年來出席年會、代表中大來說幾句話、是來補充敎部吳研因先生的所謂兒童本位、敎育是處處要爲兒童着想、若敎材敎具以及一切設施等、希望諸位研究、要注意到此、不失兒童敎育之本意、</p>
<p>▲滬市敎局代表胡叔異致詞今天本席代表上海市敎育局參加、有數點意見、㈠貴會是學術棧兹、敝局爲行政機關、敎育事業、須學術與行政互相聯絡進行、才有進步、所以敝局希望貴會隨時指導、㈡兒童敎育之進行、大别有三方面、一、爲家庭、二、爲學校、三、爲社會、貴會過去工作、似多第二方面努力、今後希望能和家庭與社會方面多加研究、實爲吾國敎育前途之福音、㈢社會方面之兒童敎育、在都市尤爲重要、</p>

<h3 id="c172">韓國開敎的元勳是中國人 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>一七九四年（即乾隆五十九年）聖誕節，有多少高麗信友，歡天喜地，在邊關上，佇候韓國第一位司鐸駕臨：在暮色蒼茫中，果然來了一位喬妝的高麗人；他的打扮，頭戴竹笠，足登草履，髮髻服色竟像一個本色高麗人：可是他生長我們江蘇常熟，姓周，名喚雅各呢！韓國開敎的元勳，是我們中國人啊！</p>
<p>周司鐸學會了高麗語言，創設了明道會，又譯述敎理書：用講學的態度傳敎，六年中收入六千名信徒！他和本地人，很相和好：可是後來，這樣一位好敎士，竟「殺身成仁」了。</p>
<p>不幸時値韓國正宗文成王崩，權臣擅政，摧殘敎會！周司鐸本計劃回國，避到中韓交界邊境；忽得神示，原路回京。</p>
<p>一天，三通雞啼，便服羅扇，鬚髮整潔，來到天牢自首的人，說道：『我就是你們通國兜拿未獲的中國周雅各司鐸，我來高麗，不爲别的：爲傳天主聖敎，救度通國生靈！現在自來投案。』當時問官，判處死罪！事後韓王曾向中朝道歉。</p>
<p>一八○一年（即嘉慶六年），下午四時，執行斬刑：天氣驟變，雷電交馳；刑塲觀衆，異常恐怖：可是將作犧牲品的，韓國的第一位司鐸，從容就義，對觀衆說：丨丨</p>
<p>『我今朝實爲傳天主聖敎而死。預告大衆：將來高麗有大災難：那時高麗人纔記念我了！』</p>

<p>— 金不同</p>
<p>丨世間事作如是觀丨</p>
<p>日軍用二天工夫，併呑了我東北三省，汗都沒有出，輕描淡寫，何等容易。接着，馬占山將軍起而反抗，連下去義勇軍，自衛軍，救國軍，衛國軍，不知名軍，弄不淸軍，紛紛發動，避實攻虚，聲東擊西，神出鬼沒，來去無踪，打得日本軍隊，僞國軍隊，顧了頭，顧不了脚。在日本，原抵當一手造成了傀儡，大勢已成，怎料到會弄到這樣一個局面。他們的幣原外相說：「併呑滿洲，無異呑下一顆炸彈，」這話</p>
<p>半點沒有錯。現在日本因爲侵略我東北，弄得國内經濟大起恐慌，而列强的不滿意，也一天深似一天。但是日本因了面子關係，又不便放手不幹。雖然前途儘有的是危險，却也不能不硬幹到底。這種局勢，正合了一句古話，呌做「上臺容易下臺難。」</p>
<p>因了這種情形，我於是聯想到了讀書問題。小學校畢業了，不得不借了債進中學。中學校畢業了，不得不借了債進大學。大學校畢業了，不得不借了債出洋留學。明知這樣一級一級的借債向上爬，對於將來的出路，未必有把握但是弄尷尬了，祇好如此。這也是「上臺容易下臺難。」年紀差不多了，不得不蘇州河畔勞白生作</p>
<p>上海美術會名作之一</p>
<p>娶一房老婆。娶了老婆之後，開銷一天大似一天，債主逼得一天緊似一天，講人情天理，惟有回復光棍生活，纔是一條出路，但是面子攸關，只好忍痛維持下去。直等到無法維持，祇好賣田賣地當當頭，對於勒索他柴米油鹽的老婆，却始終不肯放棄，拼命的硬了頭皮幹下去這也是「上臺容易下臺難。」世間一切事，皆作如是觀。</p>
<h3 id="c174">聽！日本婦人的話 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 小芳</p>
<p>丨不信你竟毫無感觸丨</p>
<p>這是一個暮秋的時分，然而在上海是沒有季候的丨</p>
<p>三友實業社裏浮滿了許多的人頭，顯然都是我們的同胞，店員們都忙碌地招待着每個顧客。</p>
<p>突然的，一個中年的日本婦人挈着一個十二三歲的小孩，出現在人叢裏。詫異，爬上了每個同胞的心頭：「日本人是最富有愛國心的，怎麽伊也跑進我們的國貨公司來買我們的東西？」於是，無數的目光，便落到伊的身上。</p>
<p>那婦人開口了，用我們大中華民國的話：</p>

<p>那小孩露着忿恨的樣子，跟在婦人的背後：</p>
<p>「媽媽！你忘掉了你是大日本的國民嗎？你怎麽買起中國貨來呢？丨你是我的媽媽嗎？···」火光在小孩的眼睛裏蕩漾。</p>
<p>「不丨孩子丨」婦人轉過頭來低低地說：「我不是買了中國的衣料來做自己的衣服呀丨我是想拿中國人所喜歡的衣料，寄回去呌我們的同胞照樣去製造，然後再來岅賣給中國人。你要知道：孩子丨我們的東西，如果只能供給自己的同胞而不想法迎合人家的心理多多推廣，那是沒有發展的希望的啊孩子丨我知道：我是大日本的一分子，我的血液，是大日本的家產，我還想把我這家產，子子孫孫的傳給我的後代。孩子丨我那裏會忘掉我的出身？否則，我還配做你的媽媽嗎？······」</p>
<p>那小孩微微地笑了，但我們的同胞却是凄然的落到了沈默裏。</p>

<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>慕良瞟了伊一眼，低低地說：</p>
<p>「鄕下人不吃木樨花，你　得輕些，給人家聽見了，便是新鮮的笑話。」</p>
<p>愛姑當眞給他嚇住了，不　，那時銀幕上已蠕蠕的有銀光移動了，嘈雜地來着外國的　盤唱片的歌曲，在沒甚經騐的愛姑，竞如墮五里霧中，大少奶奶說：</p>
<p>「中國片子好看，七曲八繞的外國字，先自不懂，嘰哩咕嚕的外國話，難聽得很，你也不懂英文的，看了有什麽滋味？」</p>
<p>慕良恨得什麽似的，幸虧在黑暗中，不至給人照見自己的狼狽。他和朋友在南京的影戲院裏，看外國片子時，總是煞費苦心，裝着懂英文的，否則豈不爲花瓶所譏笑輕視麽。現在給大夫人這們的一說，如何不恨他，想再看下去，說不辷更有掃興的事鬧出來，不如早些走罷，便向兩位夫人說：</p>
<p>「我有些不舒服，想先還還去了，你們在這裏看完了走。」</p>
<p>大夫人，如夫人都立起來了，說：</p>
<p>「沒有什麽好看，一起還去罷。」</p>
<p>在一禮拜假期將滿的前兩天，慕良毅然决然委託夏律師辦理和愛姑脫離同居關係的訴訟事件結果由慕良給愛姑一千塊綫，愛姑在半嚇半勸之下，接受了這個遺棄，在傍徨中做了一個多月的活寡婦，對着以後的將來，茫茫地不得解答。</p>
<p>慕良很堂皇冠冕地向他的朋友說：</p>
<p>「我先實行一夫一妻制度，打倒婢妾！」</p>

<p>四棧押與美商</p>
<p>中國營業公司受抵</p>
<p>計抵押洋一千萬元</p>
<p>昨已將棧務科改名</p>
<p>業經政府决議收爲國有之輪船招商局、昨日突發生一重大案件、即該局所有之總·華·北·新·四棧、由該局總經理李國杰與本市四川路中國營業公司商妥、借洋一千萬元、將上項四棧、交由該公司繼續營業、昨日下午業經接收、事前曾發生拒交糾紛、及至下午、業由中國營業公司、派員實行接收、此案情形彙錄如下、</p>
<p>▲借欵經過自李國杰繼總經理後、因感局中經濟拮据、達於極點、時有某某資團、擬欲投資、商之於李、經過相當時間、隨决定將華北新總四棧、抵押一千萬元、（一說一千五百萬元）以四棧交由資團經管、繼續營業、其草約簽訂期、尙在本年九月間、</p>
<p>▲突然訂約日前行政院第七十五次會議决議、招商局由政府續辦、並擬備欵收回商股、此項消息騰傳後、李氏以積餘公司產業、仍可自由處置遂於本周内、實行與美商中國營業公司簽訂借欵契約、以四棧爲擔保品、此案該局人員知者甚詳、其簽約内容、極爲秘密、局外人更無法探知、</p>
<p>▲接收未成李總經理於九日下午、派該局職員王允章、帶同債權方面派來西人四名、到虹口四棧經理處、向經理凌靜山接收四碼頭、由王出示局令交出之公文、並命凌簽字、四外人立待接管、不料凌以未奉部令、不允交出、堅决拒絕、接收乃未成功、</p>
<p>▲改派棧長此拒交事發生、凌即告假半月、李乃改委楊瑞年爲四棧棧長、十日楊到四棧接事、凌亦拒絕交卸、直至十一日上午、凌靜山巳　棧他去、楊瑞年始午到棧、就任四棧經理職務、但受押外人方面、亦未往接管、</p>
<p>▲電部制止凌靜山先到新總理劉鴻蓀處報告、劉命將經過情形、電致交部、請求命令制止勿令局產流入外人掌中、而押主方面、以未能接收碼頭、由派去之四洋員、歸報承押之某洋人及資本團、一面停止付欵、一面則向該局提出交涉、此事已引起種種糾紛矣、</p>
<p>▲凌氏决心招商局棧務科主任凌靜山昨致本報函云、申報館、余拒絕移交、各處責難、認余有戀棧科長之嫌、業已向李國杰辭去科長之職、將中國營業公司經理委狀退回、以謝國人、現赴漢就豫鄂皖農村金融救濟處稽核主任之職、</p>
<p>▲昨日接收十一日午後、中國營業公司派該處副科長洪得照接收、國聞社記者於下午往詢、據該處某負責人談話、業經由中國營業公司接收、即日起照常辦公、</p>
<p>▲棧科改名招商局之四棧經理處（即棧務科）設於東百老匯路三零二號昨日起、將四棧經理處名義取消、改用中國營業公司名義、並由該公司委任該局棧務科副科長洪得照、繼續主任職務、一切對内對外、完全由中國營業公司負責、内部人員、暫無更動、</p>
<p>▲改委意見此案發生後、頗引起各方重大注意、國聞社記者昨訪政府已經决定之該局某常務理事、探詢意見、據談、政府收回招商局、原爲發展中國航業、今日該局發生此種重大事件、在余等未奉委令之前、當然不能表示一切、但政府當有辦法、以對付此種不法事情云云、</p>
<p>▲委令將下又據某理事談、關於接收招商局之監事理事委令、日内即可由國府頒發、招商局押棧案、將由政府處置云云、</p>
<p>▲職工會議五碼頭全體職工聞訊、以四碼頭抵押、無異變相出賣、而此些微之華商航業、將無形斷送、至五碼頭職工生計、或將發生影響當於昨日下午五時、全體會員、紛紛要求、召集大會、當由該會召集五碼頭全體組長、開緊急聯席會議、由該會常務理事報告此事眞相後、當即由全體組長、討論應付方法、結果、議决下列辦法三項㈠碼頭抵押、影響職工生計前途、應如何應付、議决、以反對抵押爲最高原則、以保障生活爲最低限度、至進行方法、以全體組長赴局爲初步方法、以全體會員罷工爲最後行爲、㈡國府又改組招商局、應如何表示、議决、定期召集五碼頭全體會員大會取决之、㈢十月份薪水問題、議决於請願時、附帶催索、當即散會、幷擬定星期一、全體組長、赴局請願、</p>
<h3 id="c178">朱鶴翔到滬 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>將赴南洋考察領署</p>
<p>外交部因南洋各地領署、與當地華僑、意見相左、且屢接各領被控文件、因特派遣國際司長朱鶴翔、前往考察、俾便整頓、朱氏已於前日到滬、　擋行裝、準備出發</p>
<p>搱　搱▲考察動機我國在外僑胞、以南洋各屬地爲最多、近年來因世界經濟不振、以致僑商感受不良影響同時又因各地領事中之不良份子、每疏忽其應盡之護僑職責、而從事於贏利之企圖、外部所接各領事之被控案件纍纍、外長羅文幹·於痛恨之餘、曾將舊金山總領事蘇某·及棉蘭領事梁某·下令免職查辦、一方源遣國際司長朱鶴翔、前往南洋考察、俾從事於整頓刷新同時再竭力設法、爲僑胞解除痛苦、</p>
<p>▲出發地點朱自奉命到滬後、出發日期、現尙未確定、但爲時亦不甚遠、大致不出本月二十號、同行者僅秘書周伯符·現所有手續、業經委託中國旅行社代爲辦理、聞朱氏將先由香港至安南視察、然後經印度·新嘉坡·仰光·至蘇門達臘·檳榔　·巴達維亞·加爾各達·棉蘭·轉由暹羅回國、預定以三個半月爲期、每處至少逗留五日、俾充分接受僑胞之申訴、一方則視察各該地領事之能否盡職、如時間充足、幷擬赴馬尼拉一行、</p>
<p>▲領簽證事我國自實行領事簽證貨單以來、收費情形頗佳計第一月統計、由各地領事匯解至京者、共約六萬餘元、海關補收者、亦達四萬元、合計約有十萬元、我國在外各領署、共八十餘處、南洋方面、在荷屬者約有五處、英屬者四處、法屬安南地方、因越南商約之遷延、尙未確定、故此時尙無領署之設立、領事簽證一層、除暹羅方面、已委該地華僑商會鄭會長代理外、法屬安南、俟朱氏到達後、亦擬向該處華僑商會洪會長接洽、委其代辦、</p>
<p>▲中東路謠關於中東鐵路之俄方權力、盛傳將讓於法或日之傳說、昨聞此種謠言、完全爲日方用以作宣傳者、蓋中東鐵路、雖名係中俄合辦、然實際法方亦有關係在焉、蓋此路之完成、係帝俄時代所借法欵、待俄國革命後、社會主義之蘇俄政府、對此欵完全不承認、形同賴債、至一九零七年、法日協定成立後、法國即承認日本在滿洲應有之勢力、而日本亦承認法國在雲南廣西所應有之勢力、而成爲法日兩國之暗中勾結、故東北事變後、法日兩國、猶依此約相提議、但法國鑒於近來在歐洲方面地位、因德國要求軍縮平等、漸感危殆、一方又因美國爲遠東問題需拉攏英法、於是法遂捨日而就美英、因此日本在遠東地位、驟形孤單、遂不得不派松岡出外遊說、一方造作蘇俄讓與中東路之權力於法於日之謠言、以朦蔽世人、以爲俄日親善、一方進行與蘇俄締結不侵犯條約、然俄日根本不能相容、故松岡此次赴俄、必無成就云云、</p>

<p>情形報告書第四卷（二十）</p>
<p>一二、上文所述關於養老金之規定、顯然合於法定之永久服務、職員果能行爲端正、則除遇有某某數種事故外、得保持其位置、至服務滿二十年、年齡達五十歳爲止、且所謂事故如果發生、亦有請求酬報之權、但就事實而論、工部局之職員、幷不且向未享受此種法律上之權利、依照訂立三年合同之制度、工部局得隨時拒絕與任何職員續訂合同、無論距離得領養老金時期如何之近、以及因如是拒絕之結果、乃使喪失領取養老金機會、而感受任何困難、該員並無提出申訴之法律根據依照新定之合同格式、情形亦與此相同、緣縱使職員之距離取得領受養老金資格之時期僅略比六個月爲多、就法律而論、工部局仍得隨時以六個月以前之通知而解約、職員之因此種通知、且非因其自身有何過失、以致喪失其領取養老金之機會者、並無可以提出陳訴之法律根據、</p>
<p>一三就事實而論、以公允待遇其職員、向爲工部局之政策、該局從未以不合情理之辦法行使其法律上權力、而使其職員在距離領取養老金期限不遠之時、喪失其養老金、但旣有業經引述之地產章程第二十四欵所附條件、似在創立現行之養老金辦法時、工部局當依照設立此項辦法以後之當然步驟、更進而訂立一種規定、使外籍職員經過一種試用期間以後、得繼續任職、至可領取養老金之年齡爲止惟如爲局務之利益起見、有在職員達到可以領取養老金年齡以前、將該員罷免之必要、則該局仍保留此項罷免之權設使罷免之舉、非由於該員之不勝任或辦事不善、則可以合乎情理之標凖、而給以酬報、或包括按照服務年數比例計算之一部份養老金在内、</p>
<p>十四就目前而言因工部局職員在實際上所有之法律權利、與在習慣上業經工部局承認之所謂道德上或情理上之要求、爲非一致乃發生一種奇特情形、該局倘不承認此種要求、則與採用養老金辦法之全部原則爲不相符、</p>
<p>丁、任期保障之需要</p>
<p>一五、本報告書前章内（註五）會經鄭重申述、工部局欲建立一種誠實有效之行政、其主要原素之一、在於酬　、報及繼續任職兩方面、以寛厚之條件給予其職員及雇員、</p>
<p>一六、關於此層、任期保障至爲重要、以前雖有多數職員、久在工部局任職、且因此領得養老金、然一種制度、其原意固在於創立永久服務、但未永久之任何保障、給予有關係之職員、而使關於任期保障以及養老金權利等項要求之問題、悉憑當道斟的辦理、而不以確經接受並核准之條件爲根據者、殊不能認爲滿意、</p>
<p>一七、任期保障之問題、雖本由外籍職員之現有地位而發生、緣唯有外籍職員、係屬於現有養老金辦法範圍之内、但不久或將覺爲宜將爲外籍職員利益而訂立之辦法、加以必要之修改、而使其擴充及於高級華員、按照工部局輓近所採用之政策、高級華員終當日漸增加、</p>
<p>一八、如此則外籍職員聯合會所提之問題、其所牽涉之範圍、似比該會代表心目中所能立刻見及者爲廣、此非僅爲保障因工部局現有組織法之任何根本改革、或至直接影響外籍職員所有利益問題、抑亦爲所經採用使在工部局服務得有永久基礎之辦法、應如何使其費澈、以求達合乎論理之結果、而籍以協助樹立一種健全之文官服務制度問題、現有公共租界當道所能期望傳與其最後承繼人之最有價値遺物、或卽爲此種制度、</p>
<p>戌、文官服務制度之價値</p>
<p>一九、欲知此種遺物對於維持高等程度之財政淸明、以及樹立充分保障、俾無行賄與腐化之弊兩層、有何價値、祇須回憶業經引述（註六）之財政部部長宋子文君所有意見、宋君曾言·欲𪷫除若干世紀以來政府官吏之惡習、及其確實之弊竇、唯一眞正且能垂久遠之藥石」、厥爲設立一種有效之文官服務制度、但此項制度之對於一種機關、如公共租界之工部局、或任何其他機關、爲由被選舉人所組成、而終或繼承工部局現有之責任者（註七）、其價値何若、尙有爲鄙人所欲論及之其他看法、</p>
<p>二○、任何雇主、倘欲其所用人員、服務優良、必須訂立一種條件、俾能羅致適當之人士、爲其服務、並須有充份保證、使各該條件能恪切遵守但一公共機關、經秉受廣大之統治權力、並爲由隨時舉行公開選舉而被選出之人士所組成者、係立於一種甚爲特殊之地位、此種地位、足使其爲雇主之能力、與個别雇主之以個人能力、經營其所熟諳之工商事業、不至發展至爲非一人之權力所能控制者、判然有别與他種僱主相比、公共機關大槪更爲完全有賴於所用人員之品格與能力、所謂他種雇主者、即現在若干限度之内、其服務組織、係仿照文官服務制度辦理之工商業大公司、亦包括在内、公共機關之如此非常有賴於所用之人員、一部份同由於其所擔承工作之性質範圍及其種類複雜所致、但大部份實由於各該機關人員之選舉方法、及其任期之大都較短、由被選舉人士組織之任何公共機關其份子勢須常見更動、向無辦理公共事務經騐之人亦得隨時入選、此種機關除利用其職員及雇員外不能期望維持行政方面之高尙程度、及伜窒習慣、緣此輩職員及雇員、有保存此種程度及習慣之資格、故無論爲適應變遷之時勢、或爲實行選舉人與其代表之意見、而須將政策改變仍能保證行政之始終如一、以及繼續不輟、</p>
<p>二一、爲使經由選舉而組織之公共機關所有職員、得將其按照情勢而應盡之重要職務、切實辦理起見、必須使其享受合乎情理之任期保障、此種保障、不特使其有獲得所需經騐之機會、且亦給與若干限度之獨立地位、政府及市府之負責人員在履行行政職務或顧問職務之際、難免覺與公衆之情感相衝突、或與强有力之私人利益相抵觸但公衆之利益要求、職員對於此種事件、應爲社會全體之利益起見、完全自由行使其獨立之判斷並無可以畏懼之任何理由、謂或致因此去職、或其服務條件將被改變而使遭受損害、藉示懲戒、</p>
<p>二二、經由選舉而成立之任何公共機關、如公共租界工部局者、欲盡其爲統治機關所有各種之任務、大都賴有一大批之幹練職員與雇員、其任用條件、足使各該員之地位有充分保障、且能鼓勵各該員、使以其一生最能工作時期之大部份、專心爲工部局服務、所以關於規定服務人員所有任期保障酬　報以及訓練之條例、其必須妥適訂立且嚴恪遵守、洵爲事屬根本重要、</p>
<p>二三、所以工部局職員及雇員所需要之保障、無論其爲該局組織法根本改革所造成之任何特殊應急辦法或爲永久制度之一部份、非僅爲保護一類有直接關係職員所有利益之保障、抑亦爲立於僱主地位之工部局及該局所代表之社會所有利益之必要保障、此項問題之兩方面應隨時記憶勿忘、</p>
<p>二四倘公共租界統治機關之組織法、實行任何根本改革、無論此項改革之實際結果、與鄙人所用收回字樣之意義（註八）相符與否、爲良好治制之利益、及有直接關係中外職員之利益起見均須訂立一種規定、一面爲被解職或因供職條件變更而願退職之職員、保證其能得公允之待遇、一面幷使在舊制度下獲得經騐之大批人員繼續服務、如新機關能得此輩人士爲顧問並相助爲理則可使事務凌亂或任何嚴重中斷之危險、大見減少、且使舊治制所有特色、其價値之爲業經證明、且其有益結果、亦經一般嘉許者、更可在新情勢之下、有能維持之較佳期望、</p>
<p>己、解决問題之三種辦法</p>
<p>二五鄙人以爲、有三種可能辦法、或可使所有目的得達其全部份、或一部份、所謂所有目的者、即使工部局某某部份職員及雇員之服務條件、得更切實之保障且因此乃使在該局服務、其基礎足與永久文官服務制度之基礎相伯仲、所謂三種辦法者如左、</p>
<p>㈠地產章程之修正</p>
<p>㈡納稅人大會之决議</p>
<p>㈢養老金條例之修改</p>
<p>鄙人茲請將此三種辦法依次略述如下、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c230">桐油 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 盛嚴能</p>
<p>桐油，在我國出產得很多，但是自己不會精煉及利用，這是很可惜的。國人們，願你們不要以「可惜」二字了却這重大的問題，我們應切實研究，實地改良，這纔是振興實業之道哩！</p>
<p>十月二十六日，本刋發表過一篇乃徵君的「可注意的桐油」，很有價値，頗堪注意。乃徵君對於桐油的產地及來源等說得都很詳細，但是對於製煉（與製法不同）及檢騐方面却沒有談及，並且對於桐，油的用途方面，我覺得也有補充的必要</p>
<p>桐油，它是一種極重要的塗料，甚宜於屋宇的裝飾，塗於木器或鐵器上，可以防止木材的腐朽和鐵器的生銹，並且可以做白色瓷光粙，地板油，耐水油，塗刷油，護膜油，塗墻油等種種日常必需品的原料，現在把它的性質，製煉，用途，檢騐，介紹於次：</p>
<p>㈠性質生桐油所結成的薄膜，很乏彈性，並且結膜不匀，所以必須用製煉過的熟桐油方能適用，桐油的特性，能於華氏五百度以上，凝成固體，不溶於稀薄劑，但如雜有他種油類，則其凝固點常降低。</p>
<p>㈡製煉桐油的製煉法甚多，茲以我國，美國及德國的製煉法錄下：</p>
<p>甲中國製煉法：用生桐油十斤加入土子及密陀僧各二錢，下鍋熬滾，且不住以木棒攪拌，待其熬至四五滾時，可傾至瓦缽内，不住攪拌，至冷适後爲止。（此法火候，務宜適中，不可過激或過緩，以防桐油之過老或過嫩，又所加之土子及密陀僧，乃取其易乾及發亮，並無其他作用。）</p>
<p>乙美國製煉法：取生桐油十加倫置於鍋中，徐徐熱之，達華氏三五○度時，可加入鉛錳皂十磅，俟全溶後，再加凈亞麻仁油五加倫，不住攪拌之，待其溫度達華氏四百度時，可保持半小時，然後離火，加稀薄劑二至三加倫即得。</p>
<p>丙德國製煉法：將油熱至攝氏二一六度時，可保持一小時，始終攪拌，勿使中止，離火後，可用松節油稀薄之。</p>
<p>㈢用途桐油的用途甚廣，試述於下：</p>
<p>甲瓷光釉：用桐油，松脂，人工漆與透光瓷共研，可以得白色瓷光釉，　宜用於屋宇之裝飾，油重脂輕者，可塗木器。</p>
<p>乙護膜油：以少量桐油及多量硬脂所製之混成油，謂之護膜油，塗於三和土上，可將微𨻶充塞，同時其中之桐油因氧化而成堅實之護膜，以衛護三和土，使經踐踏後，不致有碎屑飛揚。</p>
<p>丙耐水油：桐油和地膠，可製耐水油，塗於水中之機械及管節上，可以隔除水之浸触。</p>
<p>丁塗墻油：爲由桐油及松脂所製成，塗於墻壁，可經水洗或雨淋。</p>
<p>戊地板油：和硬脂少許於桐油中，可製成地板油，塗於地板上，能水洗不脫，踐踏無痕，最適宜於火車及輪船中。</p>
<p>已塗刷油：又名烘油·用於塗刷汽車蓬蓋及煖爐，可以使这經久。其製法用桐油，豆油及少量之硬脂，共熬至華氏五二○度，即得。</p>
<p>㈣檢騐檢騐桐油之優劣，可以用供試品百克置於金鍋中，加熱至華氏五四○度，則純油即凝結爲淺色固體，用刀切之，不帶黏性，如油質之色較深而帶黏性者，則攙假之證。</p>

<p>人們遇到娶妻，嫁女，送友，迎賓等事，總是宴會親朋，以盡歡娛，這一來也足以聯絡感情，本是未可厚非，不過現在普通的宴會，大槪有幾種缺點，不可不亟行改革，縷述如左：</p>
<p>㈠請柬上不註明入席鐘點：有的請柬上，祇書「午刻」或「酉刻」入席，並不註明鐘點：那知每個時刻，包含兩個鐘頭，從此客人到會，參差不一，先到等待後到，勢必虚擲時光！</p>
<p>㈡讓位：主人旣定位，客應依次入座：乃每見過事謙遜之徒，避席不坐，從此你推我敬，喧驊擾攘，實在無謂之至！</p>
<p>㈢勸酒·酒之爲物，富有刺激性，最好不飲：乃普通宴會·主人每强浮人白，藉示殷勤，以害人爲愛人，使我大惑不解！</p>
<p>㈣猜拳：酒興勃發，實主每猜拳以盡歡，「三星」「四喜」「一品」「五魁」，詞句旣俗不可耐，而呌囂紛呶，又妨公德：且每至飲酒過量，斷喪身軀，亦何樂而爲之耶！</p>
<p>㈤肴饌過多：輓近俗尙奢華，每遇宴會，奇　雜集，珍味紛陳，食者腸胃有限，總不能美味均沾，空耗主人金錢，豈不失算？况「富家一席酒，窮漢半年糧！」「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨！」我們假使只恣個人口腹之慾，捫心自問，能不内疚神明乎！</p>
<p>以上云云，明達者以爲然否？</p>
<p>學堂寫眞</p>
<h3 id="c232">黑板上的形形色色 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 修</p>
<p>在前頭我急急要講的，我們是男女同校，所以每天的上課之前，黑板上總寫着形形色色的字樣，大槪都關係侮辱女同學方面的，對於蜜司×似乎寫得格包厲害些·因爲她是比較得最風騷的缘故。</p>
<p>一天午後，上第一課之前，黑板上寫着「×××（她的名字）西洋畫，×××，丁刮刮，你不要神氣，手槍對付你，」</p>
<p>不一會，鏜丨鏜丨的上課鐘打了，女同學都一齊進來，見許多男同學都對著黑板大笑大喊，那位女同學也輕輕的把頭一抬，看到黑板上寫着她自己的名字，面孔表示篆不快樂的樣子，急急的轉身向訓育處報告了。門口適遇敎務長，（因關係坐位的問題來訓話）那位女同學便訴諸敎務長，與敎務長同進敎室，敎務長見了，也很不快樂，把這些字樣徐徐的揩了，大加訓話，責問男同學，······說男子同學，同普通的事，沒有什麽稀奇。况且你們是中等學校最高的一年，更不應該有這種無意識的行爲。······同學們明知錯誤，所以很誠懇的接受訓詞。</p>
<p>後來復有素負盛名研究男女同學心理學的國文敎師錢先生·作深切的訓話（第一課是國文）全體同學莫不鼓掌。錢先生說：我們人類異性的愛，是不可泯慽的事，且並是個個人應該具有愛的心，不過所謂愛要純粹的愛，眞心的愛，拿這愛字要蓄藏在心坎中，不可在黑板上寫寫就算愛的表示這種是侮辱的愛，是爱的破裂，結果反而使求愛的目的失敗。我們要　得愛是純粹的，向女子求愛，愛者互愛之，不愛者不必再向她求愛，反而使她討厭。同時我們旣然得到了愛，不但拿我的愛去愛她，並且還要敬她，敬她就是遵守禮節，敬與愛並重，才是純粹的愛，高尙的愛。反是，是禽獸的愛，野蠻的愛，古人所謂「敬而愛之，則而畏之。」希各同學牢牢記住。······</p>
<p>這樣一來，時間覺得很快，鏜鏜的退課鐘打了，那位女同學當然不肯如此就算了事，還請訓育處追究。這不算是那位女同學的無情，是應該追究的一件事。</p>
<p>第二課上了，校工拿着訓育處的紙條，把正副級長呌去詢問，後來又呌了幾位同學，但是結果還不能查出，這是無法可想，只得貼着一張佈告「···············以後再有亂塗黑板，侮辱他人名譽者，一經查出，重懲不貸。············」</p>

<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>這是附近林立着工廠的一條××弄堂裏廂的一幕活劇。路燈映着慘淡無力的光芒，那時，照例的便麕集着一些經營小商意的夥子丨臭豆腐乾，餛飩，檀香橄欖，晚報等等無不應有盡有！放了工的孩子們，無形中在這裏認爲公共的游戲場，間或他們得勁的大打鬥力，撕滾一圈於是更加把這條弄堂　　　交　雜亂而熱鬧。</p>
<p>「好婆，好婆，我們後門口來了一個募捐的女人。」阿K喘吁吁的從後門飛也似的奔向客堂裏來，狠命拉住他好婆的衣裳這樣報告。</p>
<p>一個衣冠樸素的少婦，巳在她慈和的眼前點頭作敬了。</p>
<p>「老太太，功德無盎，做做好事吧！道裏弄口朝東念三號有個呌狗的死了，還是昨天午夜子時斷氣的　丨可　仍横在被窩裏呢！」她似乎極度誠懇地把來歷詳加說明：「唉，太太，阿狗横下來·一事無着，活時做做大司務（煑飯）怎有積蓄？據說他有個兒子當兵不知飄寄何處，他老婆自從到南京去帮人家（娘姨），迄今亦消息杳然丨爲了同居情面，所以我來替他捐點錢來燒埋燒埋。還算阿狗做人好，願捐的人也多着呢！」他順手拿了一本黃色的募捐册子，不住地顫抖抖的又說：「老太太樂善好施，定表同情，功德無量，大慈大悲丨」</p>
<p>「好，那末寫一只洋。」阿K的好婆自來是慷慨好施的人，當然這次也不會例外。這一來，後門張家嫂嫂，隔壁鄧小姐們亦各捐半元二角一等·生意一時興隆起來，大有應接不暇之勢丨最後她向衆人道謝一聲，便很慌忙地去了。</p>
<p>「啊哎，好婆，丨還遺失一本募捐册在這兒。」</p>
<p>「唔唔，快，快，帮她送回去阿彌陀佛！」</p>
<p>當阿K按着念三號的門牌尋去，眞倒霉丨那裏有什麽阿狗阿貓的死人？只落得腦海裏深深地印着一片挨駡之聲：「猪玀，放狗屁，啥死人？要儂打三年太平公醮······」</p>

<h3 id="c234">替明星們呌屈 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 寒</p>
<p>今天「閱者意見」欄内，有西湛，君的一篇「演員們須到民間云」。我把他披露出來，並非因爲他文字可取，意見高明；却是因爲（對不起西，湛，君）他的思想，代表了一般國產影片的觀衆，或是一大部份觀衆的印像。他說「現在中國的一般演員們，多數生長在大都會之中；住的有富麗的洋房穿的有華美的衣服；馥郁的濃酒；進出的汽車；在在表現了在資本主義金光閃耀下的生活。」不敏看完了這一段，不覺眉頭一縐，笑了起來。笑而縐眉頭，是因爲不敏的腦筋裏，亦生了同樣的幻想。好像看見了好萊塢的君仙集會之所：到了范朋克與璧克馥的華美大厦；門外有許多羅爾斯勞意斯，林肯，派卡，别而克，銀灰色的汽車。因爲進出的汽車一個「的」就描寫出進進出出的，不止一輛。唉，這是多麽好的粉紅色的景象；所以不敏於縐眉合眼冥想这中。微微露了些笑容出來。</p>
<p>但是從雲端裏，一交筋斗跌到水門江的地上，還是在我們中國的眼門前所見的，完全與幾秒鐘以前的幻想不同。我迴想到天氣冷了，收入不豐的演員們，製不起新衣，而向吳淞路上買估及穿；他們坐的誠　是汽車，但是係雲飛汽車行的，（又無意的替雲飛宣傳一下，）並不華貴；並且四五個人坐一輛，比黃包車還要合算。金燄係很紅的，但也祇好穿穿估衣。張織雲坐了利利公司（當然替雲飛宣傳了，不替利利宣傳，是要不答應的。）的汽車，還惹了一場氣。陳玉梅提倡布衣，也許是因爲他買不起，至少是綢緞太貴了的原故。</p>
<p>還有臨時演員們的酸辛：凍了一夜；餓了十三個鐘頭；而所得的酬勞，男的祇一元；女的一元二角。這種生活，亦係演員的生活。但這種生活。還不如拉黃包車的生活呢。但他們在影片中，不能不扮得富麗堂皇。因此而引起觀衆的誤會。這點是不敏要替明星們聲辯的，尤其是寒酸的演員們。</p>
<p>歸根結蒂，百業凋敝，生計在「餘音嬝若斷若續」之間，洋房，汽車，華服，美酒，却是明星們所追求的。但是，梅子是酸的，高高掛在樹上，你祇可以望了他嚥嚥唾沬丨</p>

<p>好萊塢的女卓别靈</p>
<p>卓别靈之所以能夠得到大衆的歡迎，是因爲他的喜劇，是悲劇的變相；最滑稽的一節，是最能引起人們的同情和深思的一幕。在淘金記中吃大餐，尋子遇仙記中的失子，城市之光的結局；可以證明上面所說的一段話。</p>
<p>現在好萊塢人士，在女星中找到一位與卓别靈有相同的作風，丨丨蔡蘇碧慈ZasuPitts丨丨而且說她是卓别靈的變身。</p>
<p>她是生在堪隆斯Kausas，但是在SantaCruz長大的。一九二零年與一位優伶湯姆葛雷ToneGary結婚。在初结婚的幾年是很幸福的，七年之後，他倆就離婚了！她雖是極不願意離婚，然而事情已無法挽回，這在她心靈上是一個極大的創痕。</p>
<p>她踏進影界，是遠在一九一七年</p>
<p>但不幸得很·被好萊塢人士忽毠了好久丨以後她繼續在各種片子裏充副角。以她的專心的研究，攝影塲中的經騐，加之以内心的蘊藉，環境所賦與的刺激；造成她現在的作風，而終於成功了。在有名的片子，像蒙脫卡羅中，可以看到她的表演；在安哈婷康絲蓓納諸大名星的片中，她的滑稽穿挿也常有的。</p>
<p>現在各大導演，感覺一張影片不能有一個很好的第一幕，常請她來表演。在她表演之下，觀衆一見她的愁容，如哭的聲音化腐臭爲神奇的表演，滑稽而含有悲哀的意味，觀衆一定滿意而笑了。</p>
<p>現在她在攝兩張長片滑稽劇，問世之後，影界必定可以鑒賞的。</p>

<p>看見了她這種亭亭玉立的姿態，撩人心意的裝束，誰捨得去打她，何况是她紅艷欲滴的桃腮；但是她終究被人打了嘴巴十九下之多。您聽了，也許會驚訝的問「誰打的？」是被一個愛爾蘭人派脫歡伯蘭PatOBrien打的。</p>
<p>你沒有進過影片公司，你或者不明白比拳毆鬭，可以假的；惟有打巴掌，是不可以假的。尤其因爲有聲電影中，打巴掌要打得淸脆可聽。男演員打嘴巴，即使響，亦不希奇。惟有女明星的嘴巴，誰敢去打她？還要響，那更難了。</p>
<p>卡羅龍巴CaroleLombard，因爲攝製「德行」Virtue一片，前後試演練習，一共被她的對方打了十九個嘴巴。情節離奇，祇好等那張片子來時，再去判定該打不該打吧。左面就是龍巴女士的倩影</p>

<h3 id="c240">「演員們須到民間去」 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 西湛</p>
<p>總觀近來各報，關於今後中國電影，應取的方針的論著，大都主張電影須革命化，大衆化，的確，現在的中國，是在急澈的動濫中，嚴重的國難，擺在我們面前，描寫兩性戀愛的電影，膚淺滑稽的電影，是不須要，無疑地，一般人已經明嘹，電影决不是供少數有閒階賞玩的，也决不是什麽超現實的靈感的產物，它本身，卽是嚴正的社會敎育的一種，推進社會進展的有力工具的一種。</p>
<p>可是現在中國的一般演員們，多數生長在大　會之中，住的有富麗的洋房，穿的有華美的衣服，馥郁的濃酒，進出的汽車，在在表現了在資本主義金光閃耀下的生活，所以在這種情形之下，卽使有很好的，描寫農村里被壓迫的鄕民的苦痛，小商人被大資本家剝奪的慘酷，帝國主義殘踏弱小民族的横暴等劇本時，爲了演員們，根本沒有體會到，注意被壓迫者痛苦的一切狀態，往往把一本很有價値的劇本，糟蹋了，這是很可惜的事，恰如一個生在熱帶的詩人，任憑旁人怎樣解釋他聽，冬天的雪，是何等的美麗，何等的皎潔，或者由他自己從各方面，搜得關於雪的材料，但因爲他親眼不曾見到過，結果仍寫不出好詩來，同樣在電影藝術裏，若演員，平常素不注意，無產階級生活的種種表現，在演劇時，雖有導演多方的鑒解，其效力仍等於隔靴搔癢，始終有一種隔膜的，當然在這種性狀下，是不能產生偉大深刻的作品。</p>
<p>所以我希望，演員們常到民間去，這樣才能瞭解平民的生活，體貼平民的困苦與艱難，好像美國的布克夫人，（Buck）因爲以前曾嘗試過農村生活，一切滋味，熟悉農民的心理狀態，所以才能夠寫驚動文壇的小說，我希望演員們，常到民間去因爲在那裏，才能找到你要研究的對象，增進你表現的藝術。</p>

<h3 id="e1">How to Commemorate Mr. Sun Yat-sen Sincerely <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Today is the birthday of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The entire country is gathering to commemorate him, comparing this great revolutionary leader and the founding father of the Republic of China. How magnificent is Mr. Sun's noble personality and glorious achievements! They are forever engraved in the hearts of the people nationwide.</p>
<p>However, we would like to ask: is it enough to commemorate Mr. Sun by bowing our heads in silent thought, reciting his will, and recounting his deeds? This kind of formal commemoration is utterly insufficient. We believe that to commemorate Mr. Sun, we should recognize his great personality and revolutionary spirit, adhere to his teachings, and implement his will through practical actions, thereby completing the unfinished cause of Mr. Sun.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong work was revolution, based on the stance of the people, for the benefit of the people, engaging in arduous struggle. The doctrines he left behind are nationalism, democracy, and ultimately people's livelihood. From this, we can understand that alleviating the suffering of the people and ensuring their livelihood is the aim of Mr. Sun's lifelong struggle. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun, we should ask whether the suffering of the people has been alleviated and whether their livelihood has been secured. If not, then instead of engaging in formal commemoration today, we should rather strive to realize Mr. Sun's will through practical action. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's personality was great and noble, and his breadth of mind was as vast as the sea and the sky. He was selfless, dedicating himself to others. His teaching, "The world is for all," is the crystallization of Mr. Sun's great personality. Because he was impartial, he was clear-sighted; because he was great, he could embrace all things. He treated people with generosity and was strict with himself, guiding the people without lording over them. Therefore, he was able to win the faith and respect of the people. Today, as we commemorate Mr. Sun, we should ask whether we can adhere to the principle of "The world is for all," sacrificing the small self and accommodating the opinions of the majority, taking the benefit of the entire nation as the premise, and making the party serve the country, so that the party can be one with the people. If not, then instead of merely engaging in formal commemoration today, we should rather emulate Mr. Sun Yat-sen, practice the principle of "The world is for all," to save the party and to save the country. This is the second point.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Mr. Sun's achievements and personality are deeply etched in our memory, shining as brightly as the sun and the moon. If we are to commemorate him, then we must inherit Mr. Sun's valuable teachings and take practical action. We respectfully offer these thoughts to the leaders of the party and to the entire nation.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Wang Delin, commander of the National Salvation Army, reported to Beiping that according to Commander Kong Xianrong, the Japanese began constructing the Ji-Hui Railway on the 1st.

<p>(Beiping) According to sources from Bu Kui, after Ma Zhanshan's troops and the National Salvation Army jointly attacked Heihe, the Japanese army suffered repeated defeats. Therefore, the Japanese dispatched fresh troops from the 14th Division to Heihe and sent three squadrons of aircraft to concentrate in Bu Kui, planning a major offensive. The Japanese army planned to focus their main attack on Ma Zhanshan's troops on the eastern front and to primarily defend the western front. On the 29th of last month, Ma Zhanshan personally commanded two brigades to attack Laha, where the Japanese army was firmly defended by the Kuroyama and Ogata joint detachments, relying on aircraft for cover. Ma's army concentrated in the Pingkuandian area, while also deploying Pu Bingshan, Deng Wen, and Cai Hongyou to attack their rear. On the 2nd, Ma went to the vicinity of Keshan to meet with Pu. The climate in Heilongjiang Province is below zero degrees Celsius. The Heilongjiang army plans to take advantage of the opportunity to launch a major counteroffensive. Traffic from Angangxi to Harbin has been cut off. Duan Zixin revolted in Anda, intercepting two columns of Japanese supply vehicles. The Japanese army, facing enemies on all sides, is very alarmed. Bu Kui closes its city gates tightly every night at 5:00 PM. There are no pedestrians at night except for Japanese troops changing shifts. The National Salvation Army on the western front, under the command of Su Bingwen, appointed Zhang Yuting as the front-line commander and has surrounded the Fularji area. Li Haiqing's volunteer army is sometimes discovered within 20-30 li of the provincial capital. The Japanese army has cut down the trees near the provincial capital to prevent attacks by the volunteer army. The Japanese army replaced the Heilongjiang Province Garrison Commander Zhang Wengui with Cheng Zhiyuan because the former unit was preparing to respond internally. Cheng's close associates are all Japanese, making him virtually a prisoner. (11th Day, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japanese Army Plans to Organize Civilian Militia <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Shanhaiguan) The Japanese army in Shenyang, realizing that the volunteer armies are scattered everywhere and mostly adopting tactics of striking the weak points while avoiding the strong, can no longer maintain the safety of the southern Manchurian and pseudo-Fengshan main lines and are frequently attacked. If each station is heavily guarded by soldiers and police, the troop strength must be increased several times the current number, which is impossible. Currently, there is no way to eliminate the local volunteer armies, and even preventing them is difficult. Therefore, the Japanese army plans to order each county in eastern Liaoning to organize armed civilian militias to specifically suppress the volunteer armies and to stipulate that if the militia is ineffective in suppressing them, the firearms will be confiscated or the militiamen will be executed. The Japanese army also hopes that Chinese will kill each other, causing the people to become hostile to the volunteer armies. Although the Japanese army's plot is cunning, there are very few militiamen who are willing to be the Japanese army's vanguard. When confronting the volunteer army, under the supervision of the Japanese army, they mostly fire their guns into the air and occasionally run into the ranks of the volunteer army and join them.

<p>And States Decisively Will Not Independently Recognize the Puppet State</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Weydent answered reporters' questions, stating: "The Sino-Japanese incident is already under discussion in the League of Nations. The Manchurian puppet government arose because of the Sino-Japanese problem. France will definitely not independently recognize the Manchurian puppet government before the League of Nations has a solution. There are French residents in Manchuria. If there is a need for negotiations, it will be a kind of unofficial negotiation with the local government of Manchuria, doing its utmost to avoid phrases such as "the French Republic responds to the note of such-and-such ministry of such-and-such country." In short, before France recognizes the Manchurian government, diplomatic officials will definitely not have direct contact with the Manchurian puppet state. The Japanese propaganda that France invests in Manchuria is absolutely not the case. France cannot easily invest in any country before formally establishing diplomatic relations. Moreover, there are not many French residents in Manchuria, and there is usually little commercial relationship. There is no need for large-scale investment. I have never heard of this matter. I only know that the order in Manchuria is still in a state of disorder, and there is fighting from the volunteer army. As for asking for my personal comments on the Northeast problem, the administrative council of the League of Nations will be held on the 21st of this month. At that time, there will be a discussion on the Sino-Japanese problem. It is really inconvenient for me to express opinions individually. As for the ministers going south, there is no major task. It is just that during the administrative council of the League of Nations, we will seek the opinions of the Chinese government on various Sino-Japanese issues nearby."

<p>(Nanjing) Wang Zhengting arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 11th morning, convened a meeting of the Jiaoji Railway Council in the afternoon, and took a train to Beiping at 7 p.m. for official business, returning to Nanjing in a week. According to Wang's remarks to reporters: 1. Roosevelt's election was expected long ago. In recent years, the American economy has declined, and the people are dissatisfied with Hoover, which is the key to winning or losing the election. Roosevelt's foreign policy is expected to have no changes compared to the Hoover era. Because the Democratic Party is inclined to join the League of Nations, future cooperation with the League of Nations will be closer. What attitude the United States will hold on the Far East issue is greatly related to the individual views of the successor Secretary of State. It is rumored that Davis has the greatest chance, but no matter who it is, it can be believed that the result of Stimson's repeated announcements of non-recognition of military aggression, and the claim of respecting China's territorial sovereignty, independence, and integrity, will remain unchanged. In short, in the Sino-Japanese matter, we should reflect on ourselves, and strive for party unity, and the cooperation of the government and the people. 2. The League of Nations will inevitably try to resolve the Sino-Japanese matter at this conference. It will not relax on the report, but the League of Nations seems unable to function as a court of law. Although it can judge impartially, it cannot enforce it. Therefore, while striving for diplomacy, we should also exert our own strength. Economic sanctions and the Northeast Volunteer Army have exhausted the Japanese. The Japanese cannot cope with the situation in northern Manchuria, and they cannot live and work in peace in southern Manchuria. Shidehara once said that annexing Manchuria is like swallowing a bomb, which has now been proven. If we persist to the end, what Japan swallowed like bread in the eastern provinces will surely be vomited out like a bomb. 3. It is rumored that the League of Nations will form an international committee to resolve the Northeast issue. This statement is not without reason. Because China and Japan cannot directly negotiate on the Northeast issue, and the resolutions of the League of Nations cannot be implemented, it is inevitable to form another committee. If this statement is true, the Sino-Japanese problem may not be resolved in a short period of time. The people of the country should prepare for a long-term resistance. 4. As for the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia, I think it can be carried out. The conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Japan and Russia is impossible due to conflicting interests. However, it is only a deliberate propaganda by the Japanese. 5. I will attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, and I plan to submit two proposals at that time. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>Labour Party Moves to Support Conclusions of Lytton Report</p>
<p>Simon Expresses Willingness to Cooperate with the League of Nations and the United States</p>
<p>Labour Party Motion Passed After Conservative Party Amendment</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 10th - The Labour Party has put forward a motion asking the Government (1) to support immediate, general and effective disarmament based on the equality of states; (2) to support the conclusions of the Lytton Report in order to maintain the principles of the League Covenant. Tonight, Mr Attlee, when proposing this motion for the Labour Party, criticised the British Government's weak attitude towards the Sino-Japanese dispute, and said that the people were greatly disappointed by the lack of progress in the Disarmament Conference. The Labour Party sees the Disarmament Conference as connected with the Manchurian issue, because the Manchurian issue is a test of whether the League of Nations can guarantee protection from attack. If this issue is not resolved, the League of Nations will lose its moral authority and the world will return to the old system of each country increasing its armaments and forming local alliances. The Lytton Commission has rendered a service to the world. In its view, Japan's occupation of Manchuria was originally just a test by the warlords. If Britain had taken a bold lead in the League of Nations earlier, he believed that this test could have been averted, because the Japanese people would not have supported this movement. The Lytton Report has given the League of Nations an opportunity to exercise its authority. The Labour Party would like to know whether the Government intends to adopt this report as the basis of its foreign policy.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Foreign Secretary Simon on Lytton Report <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon replied that the Lytton Report was to be commended, and was very moderate in its wording and full of sympathy. It was also not only the work of a true statesman, but also of a true visionary. The Report sought to present this case while remaining fair to both sides. This report not only had the unanimous agreement of the representatives of the five powers, but was also signed by the representatives of the five powers, including the United States, which was of particular importance. Now that the League of Nations has allowed Japan to be heard, it would seem unfair to make a judgement before seeing Japan's written opinion. The President of the General Assembly of the League of Nations, Mr de Valera, has decided that the Council of the League of Nations should meet on 21 November, so he advocates that a judgement should be made after hearing Japan's opinion on the report. The British Government is willing to continue to cooperate faithfully with the League of Nations, and it would be of no help to make a separate premature announcement. The Government wants the League of Nations to act as a whole. Although the situation is now worrying and unsatisfactory, the Government has reason to be satisfied, because it has been able to act jointly with the United States in a very close and cordial manner.</p>
<p>Foreign Secretary Simon then turned to the disarmament issue and said that the British Government, faced with Germany's demand for equality of armaments, was considering the principle of equality demanded by Germany on the one hand, and on the other hand was advocating that the countries of Europe should make a joint and solemn declaration that they would not use force under any circumstances to resolve existing or future difficulties between them. The British Government wants to find a basis on which Germany can rejoin the Disarmament Conference without being humiliated or harming other countries. Since Germany would join other European countries in undertaking not to use force, he would suggest the following measures: (1) The restrictions on German armaments should be set out in the same convention restricting the armaments of other countries, thus replacing the articles of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles; (2) The period of restriction on German armaments should be the same as for other countries. It is not politically appropriate to prescribe permanent measures for one country and limit the period for another; (3) The UK is willing to recognise that Germany may possess all kinds of armaments that other countries are allowed to possess, but the principle of equality cannot be achieved immediately and depends entirely on mutual trust. There should be a hierarchy, the details of which he will reveal in Geneva.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Chamberlain Asks Japanese Politicians to Consider <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain said that he has always been friendly to Japan. He has not forgotten the old Anglo-Japanese alliance, but he now asks Japanese politicians to consider the Lytton Report fairly and clearly, and to ensure that their old friends continue to maintain their former admiration for the island nation. Former Prime Minister Baldwin also joined the debate, but he limited his remarks to disarmament. He asked the world to consider whether it was possible to manage civil aviation so that the air force could be abolished. He also said that at the age of sixty-five, he did not believe that he had witnessed the last great war, but a second war might not break out immediately. Civilian aircraft have the potential to be converted into bombers, so the world's countries with air forces, and those with a concept of the skies, should consider the issue of air disarmament. Disarmament is linked to the skies, and as long as there is an air force, we will not be able to avoid this anxiety, which is the mother of all crises. Mr Lansbury, Leader of the Labour Party, concluded the debate with a final statement, first speaking on the Manchurian issue and then on Foreign Secretary Simon's proposal to conclude a new peace pact in Europe, saying that the condition of non-aggression already existed, and that there was also the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League Covenant. If the treaties are not effective, what is the use of signing them? For example, the Nine Powers, including Japan, signed the Washington Convention, guaranteeing China's territorial integrity. This convention has now been violated, and nothing has been done except for written protests. The Conservative Party proposed an amendment to Mr Attlee's motion, endorsing the remarks of Foreign Secretary Simon. The House of Commons finally passed the Conservative motion by 402 votes to 44.</p>

<p>30 Million Yen Bond Contract Signed Today</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry Promises Full Support for Bond Guarantee</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Tokyo, November 11th: A Tokyo banking syndicate yesterday accepted the "Manchukuo" request to underwrite a 5% interest bond for 30 million Japanese yen. The loan contract is scheduled to be formally signed on Saturday and Sunday, and the bonds will be issued in early December.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, November 11th: The terms for the issuance of the "Manchukuo National Founding" bonds of 20 million yen, in addition to those mentioned in the previous telegram, also include the following: (1) Handling fee of one yen; (2) Repayment method: Repayment by lottery in five years after two years; (3) Guarantee: Monopoly profits will be the primary source of repayment funds; (4) A deposit will be collected upon application to cover the first installment, with the second installment due in January of next year. Furthermore, the bonds will be treated the same as domestic bonds, exempting bondholders from income tax. The Bank of Japan has also agreed to accept the bonds as collateral. As for the "Manchukuo" government's guarantee of the bonds, Foreign Minister Uchida has declared that the Foreign Ministry will take full measures to ensure it.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, November 11th: The 30 million yen "Manchukuo National Founding" bonds are planned to be deposited in the "Manchukuo" Central Bank. Subsequently, the Central Bank, in consultation with the Japanese government and considering the Japanese financial situation, has decided to deposit all of the funds with the Japanese banking syndicate providing the loan. This establishes the first overseas cash system for "Manchukuo," with the funds being deposited inland. The funds required by "Manchukuo" will be secured by these deposits through the issuance of silver certificates. Although "Manchukuo" is currently on the silver standard, the Central Bank has a substantial cash reserve. With the addition of this deposit, the cash reserve will reach 80%, a significant step towards reaching a gold exchange standard in the future.</p>
<p>▲Japan Allied Press, Tokyo, November 11th: After selling all of the National Founding bonds in January next year, the Manchukuo government will deposit the 30 million yen in interest separately in various banks to establish an overseas currency system for "Manchukuo" as funds for issuing silver certificates. Currently, the "Manchukuo" Central Bank has a 60% gold reserve. With the addition of this 30 million yen deposit, the gold reserve will reach 80%, making it the first step towards a gold standard.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, November 11th: After consulting with the East-West Banking Syndicate about the "Manchukuo National Founding" bonds, Finance Minister Takahashi told reporters after the meeting that he had recently heard from key figures in "Manchukuo" about the latest situation in "Manchukuo," especially regarding its smooth financial and economic development, which he found very gratifying. Japan, both government and people, must assist "Manchukuo" in its growth. When the bond issue was raised at the previous meeting of the banking syndicate, unexpected progress was made, and everyone agreed to underwrite it. Today, the banking syndicate came to inquire about the government's opinion. This is truly a good thing. He hopes that in the future, this will serve as a practical lesson for the Japanese people to provide financial assistance to "Manchukuo." The reason for inviting the Foreign Minister to attend was due to diplomatic relations and the issue of guarantees. The government has no direct involvement with the National Founding bonds. Regarding tax laws, the bonds will be treated as completely foreign bonds.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, London, November 11th: The Financial Times strongly urges British investors to sell their Japanese bonds. The newspaper states that Japan's insatiable militarism is becoming unbearable and that Japan's adversity is like a sharp decline. Bondholders should pay attention to the increasing tension in interest payments in both New York and London. Although investors may be unwilling to sell their Japanese bonds at the current low price, there is no shortage of foreign bonds in the market with very low prices and better prospects.</p>
<p>The newspaper advises investors to sell Japanese bonds and buy German Young Bonds, Belgian bonds, and Chinese 5% bonds from 1913 instead.</p>

<p>Reducing Cotton Yarn Production for Three Months</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Osaka, November 11th: The directors of the Japan Cotton Spinners' Association have decided to reduce cotton yarn production for three months starting from January next year. At that time, production will be 30.8%. The current production is 36.4%.</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Osaka, November 11th: Regarding the joint operation of cotton mills in China, Okada, Executive Director of Naigai Cotton, told reporters that the contract for cotton mills in China has always existed as an ideal. Recently, someone mentioned it again at the previous committee meeting on cotton mills in China, but no concrete proposals have been made for its implementation. Iio, from Tongxing Cotton Mill, also stated that the atmosphere of a contract has recently reignited, which is indeed a fact. However, no one has yet presented a concrete plan, so this issue is likely to be difficult to realize.</p>

<p>British Government Asks U.S. to Re-Discuss</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, November 10th: The British document to the United States regarding the war debt issue was delivered to Secretary of State Stimson today, but the content was not released. This issue was not publicly discussed by European countries during the U.S. presidential election, but now that Roosevelt has been elected, it is expected that discussions will resume immediately on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, November 10th: The claim that Britain has delivered a document regarding war debts to Secretary of State Stimson has not been confirmed by official sources. However, the British Embassy has remained silent on the matter, which is tantamount to admitting the truth of the claim. Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued an article stating that merely canceling war debts is impossible, as it would neither alleviate Europe's plight nor improve the U.S. economic situation. However, if a program is proposed to restore world markets, reduce the burden of armaments, and strengthen the world monetary system, then the situation would be different. It is believed here that President Hoover will return here in a few days. Secretary of State Stimson will present the British document to the President for review before making any statement regarding war debts. President Hoover has repeatedly stated that the American people should not demand sums beyond the debtors' ability to pay. At the same time, the Treasury Department has issued an article stating that the 444,000 yuan owed by Greece, due on November 10th, has not yet been received. Hungary has also stated that it does not have foreign exchange to pay the 40,729 yuan owed and due on December 15th.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, November 10th: The British war debt to the United States will mature on December 15th of this year. Today, the British government sent a note to the U.S. government regarding this matter. The Star newspaper stated that the content of the note is not a request to not pay the debt but rather a request to the United States to modify the case in accordance with the current situation. The newspaper continued that Norman Davis, the U.S. disarmament representative, had likely reached an agreement with Prime Minister MacDonald on this matter when he was in London previously.</p>

<p>German Foreign Minister Makes No Clear Statement</p>
<p>▲Dentsu, Berlin, November 10th, dispatched by special correspondent Ogihara: The Matsuoka delegation arrived in Berlin at 10:00 AM on the 10th. Matsuoka visited German Foreign Minister Neurath at the Foreign Ministry at 1:00 PM to explain in a personal capacity the inevitability of Manchukuo's independence and the absoluteness of Japanese recognition. The meeting lasted about an hour. He also expressed Japan's attitude towards the League of Nations and conveyed important hopes regarding Germany's attitude. Due to its relationship with France, the German Foreign Minister did not clearly express his will but only explained the current cabinet's policy. However, he was deeply impressed by Matsuoka's bold and straightforward attitude. Matsuoka also attended a banquet at the Japanese Embassy at 8:00 PM. On the afternoon of the 11th, he departed Berlin for Hamburg for sightseeing and then proceeded to Paris.</p>
<p>▲Havas, London, November 10th: Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira traveled to Paris on Saturday morning to meet Yosuke Matsuoka, who was sent to Geneva to present Japan's views on the Lytton Report. The ambassador was accompanied by a certain counselor dispatched to the Japanese Embassy in Paris. Ambassador Matsudaira will return to London at the beginning of next week and then proceed to Geneva to preside over the Japanese delegation to the disarmament conference and participate in the General Disarmament Commission meeting on November 21st. Lieutenant General Nagano, carrying Tokyo's final instructions on naval disarmament, will arrive in Geneva on the 22nd. Japanese officials in London believe that Japan will not make any proposals before the powers express their opinions. Only when the proposals made by the powers are too far from Japan's views will the Japanese delegation present the plan determined by Tokyo.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, New York, November 11th: News received here from Camagüey, Cuba, reports a major hurricane disaster in Cuba, with over a thousand deaths. Other reports indicate that the sugar crops of Cuba and the West Indies have suffered severe damage, amounting to at least half of the total. Also, according to a telegram from Jamaica in the West Indies, the banana crop of the West Indies has also been destroyed. A Cuban gunboat and several other ships have been sunk by the storm.</p>
<p>▲Kuomintang News Agency, Havana, November 10th: The Cuban Ministry of Communications received a report tonight regarding the hurricane disaster on the southern coast, confirming 300 deaths in Santa Cruz and 400 missing, feared drowned. Over 200 square miles of sugar cane fields have been destroyed, with most of the sugar mills and residences collapsed and nonexistent. Residents say that the hurricane brought a 25-foot tidal wave ashore, destroying everything in its path. The disaster is so severe, and many victims have been swept into the sea.</p>
<p>▲Kuomintang News Agency, Havana, November 10th: Cuba was hit by a major hurricane yesterday. In the town of Santa Cruz alone, there were over 300 deaths. The Cuban government began to investigate and provide relief as soon as the wind and rain subsided. It is said that the wind was so strong at the time that the roofs of all the houses in the town were blown away, leaving thousands of residents with no shelter. All the rivers were swollen, causing floods. Houses collapsed, and the harvest in the fields was completely destroyed. The 300+ deaths mentioned above were all drowned in the floodwaters. Even the officials of the town government and senior officials of the province lost everything. Also, the postmaster and a member of Congress were both drowned. After inspecting several miles, the investigation commissioner immediately telegraphed nearby cities, requesting urgent relief. It is reported that many sugar mills, residential houses, and bridges have collapsed, with losses amounting to millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Britain Increases Tariffs on Goods from Southern Ireland</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Dublin, November 10th: The economic war between Britain and Ireland is now raging. From yesterday, Britain increased the import duty on goods from Southern Ireland by 11% and 12%. The Free State is now planning to retaliate by enacting 26 new taxes on British goods, which will soon be implemented. Most of the goods subject to the new taxes are already taxed, but the new tax rate has been increased to 15%. All wool products and toys costing over one shilling will be subject to the new tax rate. Valera stated in Parliament today that after the expiration of the British Empire's preferential treatment of Free State goods on November 15th, the Free State government intends to continue issuing subsidies for the export of cattle. Since the South Irish government refused to pay the land annuities, the British government levied import duties on South Irish goods to offset the land annuities. In the first few months, the tax was 12%, but the tax revenue was not enough to offset the land annuities, so the tax rate was increased from 12% to 13% and 14%.</p>

<p>▲Kuomintang News Agency, Geneva, November 10th: Today, the main committee of the Disarmament Conference discussed chemical warfare and the possibility of adopting retaliatory or punitive measures against countries that use poison gas or other chemical agents as instruments of war. During the discussion, all members of the main committee opposed the use of this method of warfare. The French representative argued that if there is a violation of the convention prohibiting poison gas, other countries should take joint retaliatory action against it. The Japanese representative, Kato, agreed with the punitive measures but opposed the act of retaliation. Chairman Henderson (England) proposed deleting the section on retaliation from the report. The French representative finally agreed, but reserved the right to propose it again to the General Disarmament Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Roosevelt Seeks New Cabinet Members <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Young and Davis Both Rumored to be Candidates for Secretary of State</p>
<p>▲Kuomintang News Agency, Washington, November 11th: Today, the political circles here have turned their attention to the selection of new cabinet members by the Democratic Party. It is said that Roosevelt will be extremely cautious in appointing officials to minimize disruptions to the economic sector during the transition between the old and new administrations. It is likely that all positions except for the Secretary of State and Treasury Secretary will be announced at the last minute. The early announcement of the aforementioned two positions is intended to instill confidence in the people of the country that economic matters are being entrusted to capable individuals and to reassure foreign countries that international affairs can still be handled skillfully. As for the cabinet members, it is said that they will all be Democrats. Some Republicans who supported the Democratic Party's campaign will be rewarded separately, such as Senators Norris and Johnson, who are both likely to be rewarded. Regarding the cabinet lineup, it is said that Young (the creator of the Young Plan for reparations) will be invited first. Even if Young does not intend to join the cabinet, he will be strongly urged by the party, as key figures within the party believe that administrative success cannot be achieved without Young's support, or at least without his help during the Democratic Party's initial rise to power. However, it has not yet been decided whether to ask Young to serve as Secretary of State or Treasury Secretary. Peck, who led the national election campaign this time, has worked hard and achieved great success. Many friends have advised him to take the post of Prime Minister, but it is said that insiders believe that Peck is quick to judge, so it seems more appropriate for him to take on other positions. Another piece of news is that Roosevelt believes that after taking office, he will have to deal with major international issues such as the disarmament war and the Manchurian case. Therefore, he recognizes that the person to be appointed as the ambassador to the United Kingdom has the same talents as the Secretary of State. Therefore, whether to invite Davis to serve as the ambassador to the United Kingdom or the Secretary of State is currently a matter of careful consideration for key Democratic figures. Although Young is known as a financier, he has many years of international experience. Furthermore, with Davis in London, Young will be able to perform the duties of Secretary of State satisfactorily. If such an arrangement is made in the future, the Treasury position is expected to belong to Senator Glass or De Wu Nuo, President of the First National Bank of Chicago. De is a nationally renowned financier and served as a government committee member during the European War. Some people invited De to be a candidate for Vice President this time, but De declined. As for Glass, who is 74 years old, it is said that he feels quite hesitant about the arduous duties of the Treasury. In short, Roosevelt's future selection of cabinet members will focus on financial and international relations.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, November 10th: Roosevelt has informed the leaders of the Democratic Party Convention that from now until March 4th, the date he takes office, he will devote himself to establishing institutions, drafting civil party administrative procedures, and selecting a cabinet, which will be announced before the new president takes office and enters the White House, which will be an exception.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, New York, November 10th: According to the latest election reports, Roosevelt received a total of 20,193,000 votes, and President Hoover received a total of 14,202,000 votes. It is predicted that the Socialist Party presidential candidate Thomas will receive a total of 800,000 votes. The House of Representatives currently has 306 Democrats, 110 Republicans, 3 Farmer-Labor Party members, and 13 whose attitudes are clear.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Rome, November 11th: U.S. disarmament delegate to the Disarmament Conference, Davis, is touring Florence, Italy. When reporters asked him, Davis expressed his satisfaction with Roosevelt's election as president. As for the rumor that Roosevelt will invite him to take the post of Foreign Minister, Davis shrugged his shoulders and did not answer. Davis left Florence this morning for Milan and will travel to Geneva from Milan.</p>

<p>▲Havas, Berlin, November 10th: Chancellor von Papen reported to President Hindenburg tonight on the results of the cabinet meeting discussing the current situation. The President still advocates concentrating the power of various parties within the framework of the presidential cabinet system and instructed von Papen to contact the leaders of the National Socialist Party, the Center Party, and the Nationalist Party to inquire about the extent to which each party can support the government's economic and financial policies. After receiving the order, von Papen will convene the leaders of the three parties to seek their opinions. The first to be met will be Hugenberg, the leader of the Nationalist faction. It is well known that the Center Party has expressed that it does not want to participate in the coalition that von Papen is forming to implement his plans. The mouthpiece of the National Socialist Party, "Attack Report," has reiterated that any compromise based on the current government's proposals is impossible. The party only demands that Hitler form a cabinet. The Catholic Center Party's "German Daily" even said that each party should oppose negotiating with von Papen and should initiate the organization of a larger coalition cabinet. From all these circumstances, it seems that Chancellor von Papen's negotiations with the leaders of the various parties will ultimately fail.</p>

<p>▲Havas, Geneva, November 11th: Last night, the situation here was as peaceful as ever. There was no need for the army to maintain vigilance. The whole of Switzerland was also quiet. However, the authorities still prohibited gatherings or processions in some cities and took various measures to ensure that the army could be quickly dispatched. The Executive Committee of the Swiss Trade Union Federation refused to participate in the events involving the Socialist Party in Geneva. Socialist Party leader Nicole has been arrested and is being interrogated at the prosecutor's office. His request for bail has been denied because the alleged offense is of a criminal nature. According to official investigations, twenty-two young soldiers were injured before the army opened fire.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, November 10th: A total of twelve people died and sixty were injured in the Geneva riot. People still feel fearful. The army is now protecting the League of Nations Secretariat. The authorities have arrested two Socialist Party leaders and two Communist Party leaders in connection with the case. They were reportedly directing last night's demonstration. One of the two Socialist Party leaders, Nicole, is a Socialist Party member of parliament and is accused of inciting the mob to resist the army suppressing the riots.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, London, November 11th: An international common currency is currently in development. It is called "Bartrex." The plan was created by the London Chamber of Commerce and is also supported by the British Chamber of Commerce, the Confederation of British Industries, and the National Confederation of Manufacturers. According to the initiators, if international finance collapses, countries adopting this plan may use the "Bartrex" currency clearing house to restore simple transactions. "Bartrex" will represent a certain quantity of goods and can be expanded with the expansion of trade. It can also be used to correct excessive trade surpluses. The initiators are currently in contact with the government to set up a clearing house in the UK and to invite representatives from foreign banks to participate in the meeting. It is said that bad debts can be cleared if they are converted into an equivalent number of "Bartrex." The countries concerned will guarantee the repayment of this amount with the export of goods within ten years.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Japanese Autumn Maneuvers Begin <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Osaka, November 11th: The Emperor, who spent the night at the Fourth Division Headquarters, left the Headquarters at 9:00 AM with Internal Minister Makino, Court Minister Ichiki, Military Secretary Nara, and others to oversee the grand maneuvers. He traveled by motorcade, led by military police officers, to the Ueda Station on the Daiki Tramway, where he changed to a large tram to Tenri Station. He then changed to a motorcade to the front of the Tenri Foreign Language School, where he changed to a mounted parade. At 11:30 AM, he arrived safely at the highland of Mount Karikura in Bunjō. At that time, the battle between the North and South armies, aiming to occupy the Takadai area of the Yamato Plain, was gradually intensifying. The South Army took the offensive, and the North Army responded with excellent cavalry. The sound of cannons shook the sky. The Emperor personally observed the battle with binoculars and occasionally asked questions to Prince Kan'in, Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Masaki, and others. After a short break at noon, Seii Yamabe, a retired infantry lieutenant, lectured on "The Battle Traces of Emperor Jinmu's Conquest of Yamato" for about 20 minutes. At 1:00 PM, he rode his beloved horse "Shirayuki." At that time, the bugle for cease-fire had been sounded, and the troops were deployed in the trenches. The Emperor followed his entourage, inspected the battle traces, and witnessed the activities of the soldiers in villages such as Motoara. He was very satisfied. After completing the inspection of the battle line, he returned to the Headquarters at 2:00 PM. When the Emperor first arrived, morale was boosted. The North Army, having discovered the enemy's position last night, either used a small force to take advantage of the dangers of the Mount Kongo range to seize the distribution center of supplies in Osaka in one fell swoop, or used its main force to defeat the enemy's army. One of the two was inevitable. The South Army would advance its main force to defeat the North Army's main force with all its might and occupy the Osaka Plain. Therefore, the first day would be centered on the Yamato Plain, and a decisive battle would be fought.</p>

<p>Hankou Dispatch: The seven-province highway conference of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, convened by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Three Provinces, held its opening ceremony on the 2nd. Five general meetings were held until the 9th, and all proposals were discussed. Matters such as route determination, funding, construction period, jurisdiction, liaison, transportation, and protection have all been discussed and resolved. According to a participant, if implemented smoothly, it will significantly benefit military affairs, national defense, politics, and the economy. The closing ceremony was held in the auditorium of the Appeasement Commissioner's Office at 9:00 AM on the 10th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek personally attended and delivered an address. Those present that day included Chief of Staff Cao Haosen, Chief Advisor Zhu Shaoliang, Secretary-General Yang Yongtai, Secretaries Luo Junqiang, Wang Zhaoquan, Yu Zhiming, Director of the Communications Department Xu Baozhong, Director of the Transportation Department Lin Xiang, and the conference's attending and observing representatives Gong Xuesui, Zhang Weihe, Zhou Jialong, Zhou Fengjiu, Chen Ticheng, Zhao Zukang, Li Shucheng, Qin Fen, Qian Shiyi, Wang Lun, Zhang Jingyu, Wang Lixing, Liu Yiyan, Yao Shilian, Xu Xingcheng, and Xu Xianwen, as well as the administrative inspectors of Henan and Anhui provinces Xu Peinan, Gao Shouheng, Sheng Shiheng, Xi Chulin, Shen Peng, Wang Shugong, Luo Jingxian, Xiang Naiqi, Zhou Junnan, Liu Bingcui, Meng Guangpeng, Chen Shikai, Hu Yuwei, Zhen Jiqiu, and Chen Bojia, totaling more than forty people. After the meeting began, Chairman Chiang delivered an address, stating that starting something is easy, but success is difficult. Now that bandit suppression is about to achieve complete success, future difficulties will be even greater than today. The fundamental method for bandit suppression is to develop transportation and organize the people. Representatives should pay attention to this point. The highway conference has now concluded, and its resolutions are generally correct. Representatives should return and strive to implement them quickly, economically, and effectively. They should do the work of two people with one person and make one dollar do the work of two dollars to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Administrative inspectors should focus on identifying and recommending talent. After Chiang's address, Qin Fen delivered a response, stating that they sincerely accept the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief and will adhere to the resolutions and strive to implement them. After the response, music was played, and the meeting adjourned. Chiang then returned to the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters. At 11:00 AM, he separately met with representatives and administrative inspectors to inquire about everything. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, he met with League of Nations experts A. Gondar, Trani, Ballegeer, Bodley, and Perley. After the conference concluded, there was a proposal for all representatives to inspect the highways in Hunan. However, Secretary-General Qin Fen, Chief Engineer Zhao Zukang of the National Economic Commission, and the representatives of Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces needed to return to their provinces urgently and could not go. The representatives of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces are scheduled to accompany the Hunan representatives to Hunan for inspection on the 11th. (November 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e99">19th Route Army Actively Builds Roads <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>▲ Highway from Zhangzhou to the Provincial Capital Nearing Completion</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Zhou Xingnan, Director of the 19th Route Army's Military Road Engineering Office, recently stated that the highway from Zhangzhou, via Quanzhou and Xinghua, to Fuzhou, about 500 li long, is extremely important for national defense and transportation. Since construction began in sections, with each section marked off and managed independently, the roadbed for the entire line is now 80-90% complete, and the bridge and culvert construction is about 20-30% complete. However, there are as many as 13 car companies leasing sections of the route, some with 30 li limits and others with 50 li limits, which is too fragmented. He recently came to the province to discuss completing the road plan with the Construction Department and the Highway Bureau. The entire project will be divided into two major sections: the first section from Zhangzhou Jiaomei to Huian Fengting, and the second section from Fengting to Fuzhou Xiana. The connecting routes and bridge and culvert construction for both sections will require about 1.2 million yuan (including the construction of a cable-stayed bridge from Dounan across the Longjiang River to Doubei, which is the largest project and requires 300,000 yuan).</p>
<p>The plan is to merge the existing 13 companies into one or two large companies to lease the two sections of the route and operate vehicles. The lessee companies will each raise some of the construction costs, which will be repaid over the years with the route's rental income. This plan has been approved by the Provincial Government and the Pacification Headquarters. Therefore, Zhou is returning to Zhangzhou to personally oversee the construction of the first section and has appointed Zhang Youren as Deputy Director of the Engineering Office, establishing a branch office in Quanzhou to be responsible for the construction of the second section. He has also hired bridge construction expert Xu Shisheng to survey the water volume of the Wulong River and engineer Guo Deqing to inspect the altitude of Xiangsi Ridge (the steepest part of the entire road, about 5 li uphill and 5 li downhill) in preparation for construction. It is estimated that it can be completed within six months. After that, ordinary commerce from the province to Zhangzhou can be reached in six hours. If war breaks out and the sea is blockaded by the enemy, this road can serve as a shortcut for transporting troops and deploying defenses inland. If extended, it can run from Zhangzhou via Zhao'an to Guangdong and from Fuzhou via Fu'ning to Zhejiang, becoming the only trunk road in the three southeastern provinces. Furthermore, after the recapture of Longyan, the highway from Zhangzhou to Longyan is also being actively constructed by the 19th Route Army Headquarters, and it is expected to be completed by the spring of next year.

<h3 id="e100">Opening of the Baosheng Temple Ancient Artifacts Museum in Suzhou <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Display of Tang Dynasty Sculptures and Sutra Pillars</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The Luohan of Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi were sculpted by Yang Huizhi of the Tang Dynasty. Originally, there were eighteen statues, artistically wonderful and historically valuable. In the 7th year of the Republic, Gu Jiegang visited Jiao and was amazed by their exquisite craftsmanship. Five years later, he revisited Jiaozhi, but Baosheng Temple was dilapidated and the statues were half-destroyed. He and Chen Wanli took several photographs and made efforts to preserve them everywhere. Soon after, Professor Omura Seigai of Tokyo University of the Arts in Japan heard about this and rushed to China to visit Jiao and was reluctant to leave. He took 28 photographs in five days and wrote a book called "Remnants of the Tang Sculpture Wall," which contains detailed research on the Tang sculpture. The book sold for 12 Japanese yen. Omura also called them the treasures of East Asia. Only then did the Chinese people gradually pay attention to them. Subsequently, Gao Mengdan and Ren Shuyong requested the Jiangsu Provincial authorities to preserve them. After the news spread, Cai Yuanpei, Ye Gongchuo, and others visited and felt it was necessary to preserve them. They initiated a fundraising campaign, organized a committee, and rebuilt Baosheng Temple, building a new house on the original site of the Daxiong Hall as the Baosheng Temple Ancient Artifacts Museum, to house the Tang Dynasty Luohan and ancient buildings in the temple. Construction began in the 19th year of the Republic and has recently been completed. The damaged parts of the Luohan have also been repaired by famous sculptors. The museum (Tang Sculpture Luohan)</p>
<p>(Tang Sculpture Luohan)</p>
<p>(The above were all taken in the 18th year of the Republic)</p>
<p>is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony tomorrow (the 12th). In addition to approving the letter from the Ministry of Education's Committee for the Preservation of Tang Sculptures in Jiaozhi Baosheng Temple, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has sent telegrams to the Wu County and Kunshan County governments, each preparing two steamships and tugboats (each capable of carrying approximately 40 to 50 people; Suzhou has designated the dock that has always been used for travel to Jiaozhi, departing at 7:00 AM; Kunshan docks at the Zhengyang Bridge Liutong Dock, departing between 8:30 AM and 9:00 AM, returning on the same day) to provide proper hospitality.

<h3 id="e101">Miao Qiujie Handles Salt Monopoly Disputes <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Seven Regulations Stipulated, Requiring Both Parties to Comply</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: The Huai salt monopoly dispute has not been resolved for many days. Miao Qiujie, the Huaihe Salt Transport Envoy, had no choice but to take decisive action. After discussions on the 9th, seven methods for handling the dispute were agreed upon. Jin Xiangsheng, the Bengbu tax collection commissioner stationed at the Huaihe Salt Affairs Inspection Office in northern Anhui, was ordered to issue a proclamation announcing the handling methods as follows: (1) To maintain the food supply for the people, the North Salt Public Business Office should begin operations on the 10th of this month. All civilians, vendors, and salt merchants who wish to purchase more than one bag of salt can trade with the office, and no one is allowed to monopolize the business. (2) The establishment of the North Salt Public Business Office has been approved by the Minister of Finance for a six-month trial period. If any malpractices are discovered, the people should be allowed to file complaints at any time, so that the advantages and disadvantages can be reviewed at the end of the period and a decision can be made. (3) Public welfare donations and subsidies for various organizations and schools, which were previously collected and allocated by the Salt Merchants' Association (the Salt Merchants' Association collected 1.9 cents from salt transporters, allocating 0.5 cents to the Public Security Bureau, 0.5 cents to the Chamber of Commerce, 0.2 cents to schools, and 0.2 cents for temple repairs; in addition, it collected 0.5 cents from buyers, allocating 0.1 cents to the Jianghuai Middle School), will now be collected by the North Salt Public Business Office and supervised by the Salt Affairs Tax Collection Office. At the end of each month, a public announcement will be published in the newspaper, and the relevant organizations will issue receipts to the North Salt Public Business Office to receive the funds. If any organizations are missing from the list, they can report to the Tax Collection Office and receive the funds after verification. (4) The salt merchant's commission of one cent should be collected from the buyers. If there are any other demands for miscellaneous fees, the people can report to the authorities at any time. (5) Both buyers and sellers should use standard scales, which will be issued for use after being calibrated by the Tax Collection Office and will be supervised by personnel at any time to prevent unfair weighing. (6) The daily salt price will be published in the newspaper. (7) Anyone who disrupts the order, seeks personal gain, or intentionally violates the regulations will be severely punished according to law. Miao also instructed the Bengbu Salt Transporters' Association that the establishment of the North Salt Public Business Office was originally a temporary measure to help large and small transporters, maintain the food supply for the people, and ensure ample tax revenue. It has been approved by the Minister of Finance for a trial period, after which the advantages and disadvantages will be reviewed to determine whether to continue it. During this six-month trial period, all transporters should understand the intentions of the government and proceed carefully. The salt must not be mixed with impurities, the weight of the salt must not be shortchanged, and the price must be fair. Do not be greedy for temporary small gains, give people an excuse to criticize, and cause trouble for yourselves. It is hoped that if there are unscrupulous people who use the name to disrupt business, this envoy will punish them severely according to law without leniency. (November 10th)</p>

<p>The County Government Convenes a Rent Collection Meeting: The county government convened a rent collection meeting for the 21st year of the Republic yesterday (the 10th). Over 30 people attended, including district chiefs, agricultural representatives from each district, and representatives from various agencies such as the county party headquarters. County Magistrate Shen, who chaired the meeting, reported on the purpose of the meeting and the quality of rent collection over the past three years. He then proposed how to stipulate this year's quality. The party headquarters representative expressed the opinion that although the harvest this year was plentiful, low grain prices hurt farmers and tenant farmers should be taken into consideration. It was decided by public vote that this year's quality would be 79%, meaning that each shih of rent would actually be 7.9 dou, and the price would be converted according to the market price.</p>
<p>▲ Another Robbery Case in Caoging: Caoging in Punan is a coastal area where bandits frequently appear. Robbery cases have been occurring repeatedly recently. Unexpectedly, on the night before yesterday, more than ten bandits suddenly came to the home of Wang Caixing in that area, broke into the house, and searched it at will. The victim dared not say a word. As a result, clothing and jewelry worth about 600 yuan were stolen, and the bandits fled. The victim has reported the case to the authorities for investigation.</p>

<p>Farmers Oppose Increased Land Taxes: The land tax in Wuxing County, Zhejiang, and its surtaxes have increased over the years, exceeding more than twice the regular tax. Recently, due to the establishment of an obligatory defense corps, it was proposed to increase the mu tax by another 10 cents. Upon hearing this, farmers Zhang Guangyu and Zheng Tongguang of the county believed that it violated the Ministry of Finance's measures to limit land tax surtaxes. They immediately petitioned the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Finance Department to find a way to stop it. The Ministry of Finance, because the county's land tax surtaxes already exceeded the regular tax and should be reduced, has ordered the Zhejiang Finance Department to investigate and reply. It is reported that the Finance Department also believes that the county's farmers are already burdened and it is inconvenient to increase the tax again, so it will order the Wuxing County Government to withdraw the original proposal.</p>

<p>Elementary School Teachers' Major Petition: The county administrative meeting was originally scheduled to close at noon on the 9th. However, because the educational community of this county felt that the education funds had been in arrears for more than eight months and the administrative meeting never mentioned it, the educational community of the three districts petitioned, but there was no result. Therefore, the teachers and staff of the schools in the first district (urban area) gathered 60 to 70 people in the afternoon and went to the county administrative meeting to petition, requesting a temporary motion to pay off the old arrears of six months and stipulate that payment must be made on the 15th of each month, etc. Seeing this situation, the conference temporarily proposed a treatment measure for discussion, resulting in the determination of two measures to address both the symptoms and the root causes. For the treatment of symptoms, the Finance Bureau will issue payments on a monthly basis starting in November, and also retroactively issue one month's worth of old arrears. A committee for handling arrears will be organized. For the treatment of the root causes, the Education Bureau will base spending on actual needs and avoid false receipts and actual expenses. The Finance Bureau will allocate the educational funds collected at any time for safekeeping by the Education Bureau. However, the teachers felt that there were still no concrete measures for the current issuance of funds, and made a second petition after the meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM. After repeated persuasion by the county bureau chief and others, they finally agreed to issue one installment of new and old arrears by the 20th, and the teachers dispersed.</p>

<p>Robbery in a Rural Area During Winter Defense: Cao Jifu, a carpenter from Yangming Township, Shengxin Bridge, Cao Lane in the county, had some savings. At 11:00 PM the night before last, five bandits suddenly came, each holding sharp blades, iron rulers, and other weapons, broke into the house, and rushed into the bedroom, scaring the victims into silence. They ransacked the house and snatched away a pair of gold earrings from the ear of Cao Jifu's wife, causing injury.

He immediately dispatched detective team leader Xue Furui, along with an informant, to Shanghai. They encountered Qian by chance on the way and arrested him. He was then escorted to Wuxi and interrogated by the Public Security Bureau. Qian Zixiang confessed that Qian Gengshang from Beixiang was a former Communist Party member who worked hard. He had no prior knowledge of the kidnapping of Weng Zhendong, but he had served as a liaison and messenger in the Lu Zugen family kidnapping case and received 20 yuan in stolen money. He was sent to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<p>▲ Fire in a Shantytown Burns an Old Woman to Death: In the shantytown of Song Xueren outside the west gate, south of the Taibao Zhenxin Yarn Factory, a fire broke out after 9:00 PM the night before last due to leaving burning embers while cooking dinner, resulting in a conflagration. The wind was strong and the fire raged. Before long, it spread to neighboring houses. Fire brigades from various locations dispatched dragons to put out the fire, which was finally extinguished.

<p>▲ Public Security Bureau Expels Lu Yinmin: The Zhenjiang Public Security Bureau discovered that Lu Yinmin from Fujian, who claimed to be the Jiangsu Opium Suppression Commissioner, and then the General Manager of the Xinghua Silver Company, was making a show everywhere, hoping to contract for business and collect certificate money. The Xinghua Silver Company had long been ordered to be sealed up by the Construction Department, but Lu Yinmin still did not know to restrain himself. When the Zhenjiang Public Security Bureau heard about it, they sent personnel to confiscate his documents and privately printed stamps, and sent police to monitor him and expel him from the country.</p>
<p>▲ Hiding His Young Son to Defraud His Father's Wealth: Huang Zhengqing, the young owner of the Jin Yuan Money Shop in this port, although over thirty years old, has never been engaged in honest work and only associates with bandits. He has repeatedly caused trouble, and people in society have paid attention to his actions. His father has strictly taught him, but he has ignored it. Since this year, he has been with gamblers such as Fan Chengzhang, and has often lost. Because the economic power is still in his father's hands, he cannot freely withdraw funds for his extravagance, resulting in embarrassment. The gamblers, thinking of him as a profligate son, borrowed money for him at high interest rates, reaching a total of more than 13,000 yuan. He has been forced to repay the debt by creditors for days, and he could not repay it. Because of this, he had a whimsical idea. He conspired with a close friend on the night before last at about 9:00 PM to pre-arrange with a Mr. Wang at No. 65 Xinhe Street to take his young son to his residence at No. 15 Jiuru Lane, and the nanny followed. At 10:00 PM, he reported to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau that two bandits had brought handguns to his residence and kidnapped his young son along with the nanny. After Xue, the bureau chief, interrogated him repeatedly, he stammered and there were many strange points. He promised to inquire after strict interrogation, and he was suspected of being suspicious. He immediately ordered two detectives to follow him to investigate. Fearing that his report was false, he notified all branches to search closely. Upon hearing the news, all the branches were dispatched to investigate. Until dawn, according to a secret report, the child was hidden by Huang Zhengqing at No. 65 Xinhe Street. He immediately went to search the place. Huang was also present at the scene and claimed that the child had been found and asked not to be investigated further. Chief Xue considered the case to be serious, so he brought Huang Zhengqing and the child, along with the nanny and Mr. Wang, to the bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, he owed more than 13,000 yuan due to gambling and could not repay it, so he made this deal to defraud his father of a large sum of money to pay off his debts. After hearing the confession, Chief Xue immediately transferred him to the Judicial Section of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Director Dai ordered the police to summon the gambler Fan Chengzhang for a trial, and then detained him, waiting for the accomplices to be arrested before investigating the matter and sending them to the Security Department for punishment.</p>

Now, the group believes that the Zhonghua Daily's supplement in this city contained a topic called "Destroying the Religion," which contains the words "It is a pity that Father Pig has no clouds, destroying the religion, do not try to save your mother's life," which is considered to be fabricating facts, insulting Muslims, and intentionally provoking trouble like the Nanhua and Beixin newspapers.

The An and Quan Charity Ferry immediately saw it and went to great lengths to rescue Ma Yulong and his family of nine, who were able to survive. As for the more than 200 dan of soybeans, they had drifted away with the waves, resulting in a loss of about 1,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Ten Copper Coins Lead to a Market Strike: Xu Ruxiang, the director of the Chengguan Public Security Bureau, because his family bought rice, and the rice shop Hou Xiangxing miscalculated ten copper coins, Xu immediately detained Ji Dingchen, the shop's employee, for interrogation and punished him by parading him through the streets with gongs and signs. This aroused the public outrage of his colleagues in the shop industry, who gathered hundreds of people, intercepted Ji halfway, and pushed the escorting police officer Chen Yuwu and others to the county chamber of commerce, requesting assistance in punishing them, and the momentum was fierce enough to cause a major change. Fortunately, Gu Lunan, the chairman of the association, persuaded them with all his might, and they dispersed late at night. The next day, the industry went on strike demanding the dismissal of Director Xu. Cheng, the county magistrate, was out in the countryside on official business, so the issue could not be resolved. On the third day, the strike continued, and there was brewing of various industries joining the strike. On the fourth day, County Magistrate Cheng returned to the city and agreed to dismiss the bureau chief. The industry then resumed business.</p>

<p>▲ A Large Number of Refugees Arrive in the Western Countryside Sandy Areas: On the afternoon of the 9th, 150 Hunan refugees, men, women, old and young, arrived in the sandy areas of the western countryside. The refugees were of mixed races and acted strangely. The residents of the sandy areas were afraid of being robbed and closed their doors to protect themselves. The township chiefs of the area felt that it was inappropriate for the refugees to stay during this winter defense period, so they rushed to the Xiyu Police Station and requested that the police escort them out of the territory. The representatives of the refugees continued to ask for supplies from house to house.</p>

<p>County Chamber of Commerce Mediates a Loan Dispute: The Chunze Company, organized by Chen in Hengshan to raise funds, aimed to promote reclamation and develop the rural economy. It was originally a beneficial undertaking for the local people's livelihood. However, since the death of the former manager Zhu Xincai, the company's various businesses have been managed by employees Zhong Zuoqing and Jin Zhonghe. The current manager, Zhu Songsan, is too busy and does not ask about many things. The business is now focused on profit-making, and the local people have complained. Recently, the company's accounts for an 800-yuan deposit made by Qian Ailin were confusing, resulting in a dispute. At the beginning of the transaction, Liu Hongjun acted as a mediator and did not charge a mediation fee. The annual interest was set at one cent per month. After the expiration, the company allowed him to withdraw the land for conversion to repay the loan. 550 yuan of the deposit has been paid. However, due to confusing accounts, the two receipts issued were inconsistent, the interest rate was arbitrarily increased, and a mediation fee was added. The records were initially forged and then altered. The borrower refused to be deceived, so Liu Hongjun invited Liu Jiean, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to refute them one by one. Manager Zhu Songsan admitted that he was wrong and was willing to apologize and donate 100 yuan for road repairs. This could have been settled, but Zhong Zuoqing and others felt that it was too embarrassing and submitted their resignations to the company. The manager was coerced and changed his original position, refusing to mediate. It is reported that Liu Hongjun has filed a criminal complaint for forging and altering commercial records. The trial was held on the 3rd of this month.

<h3 id="e114">Letter from the 8th District Office of Kunshan <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter: I recently read the Kunshan communication in your newspaper's local correspondence column on November 9th, titled "Gambler Escapes Mid-Game and Drowns." It stated that the villagers were deeply angered and gathered at the Public Security Bureau to argue, causing great disorder. It was further stated that the district office sent personnel to mediate and disperse the crowd. Upon investigation, our district did not send anyone to mediate at that time. The information in your newspaper is presumably based on hearsay. We hereby request a correction be published. Sincerely, to the Editor, Kunshan County 8th District Office, November 9th.</p>

<p>The Shaanxi natives in Shanghai issued a declaration refusing Zhou to be the head of the Shaanxi Department of Education, stating that Shaanxi is unfortunate. In recent years, education has been involved in political whirlpools and storms have arisen one after another, and there has been no peace. String music has been stopped for a long time, scholars have lost their education, and the national lifeline of education is directly in a state of bankruptcy. Looking back at the cause, it is due to the fact that the person in charge of education is not suitable. If we want to correct the past malpractices and save the declining trend, we must carefully select a high-minded and pure educator who has excellent character and academic achievements, is outstanding in performance, and has no partisan background to come forward and preside. The reason is easy to understand and there is no need to repeat it. Unexpectedly, Zhou Xuechang was the head of Shaanxi Education, and I was horrified to hear the news (below omitted).</p>

<p>Chairman Chen Heqin reported that the meeting was opened at 10 o'clock, and the etiquette was followed. Chairman Chen Heqin gave a speech, saying that today, the China Children's Education Society is holding its third annual meeting, and it is very happy to have such a grand meeting. This society held its founding meeting at Bojue Society in West Lake, Hangzhou in July of the 18th year of the Republic of China. Only about 40 people attended, but before the founding meeting, this society already had a rudimentary form. In Nanjing, several comrades engaged in early childhood education already had a research combination. By the 19th year, the first annual meeting was held in Wuxi, and the number of attendees was higher than at the founding meeting. At that time, meetings were held and everything was discussed on the boat, and everyone was very interested. The second annual meeting was held in Shanghai because of convenient transportation, and as many as 400 people attended. This is the third annual meeting, and there are no accurate statistics on the number of attendees. As for the current situation within the society, there are more than 800 individual members and 35 group members. We are very optimistic that this annual meeting will exhibit achievements in health education, because ordinary families do not pay attention to children's health, so this society must take on the responsibility of striving to promote health. As for the progress of the society's work, there is joy on the one hand and fear on the other. What is joyful is the development of the society's affairs, and what is fearful is that the outside world has too high expectations, and our responsibilities are too heavy. On behalf of the colleagues, the speaker apologized to the guests.</p>
<p>▲ Ma Ketan reported on the preparations, briefly saying that the third annual meeting was originally scheduled to be held in April this year, but it was postponed due to the Shanghai war. The location of this annual meeting was decided at the previous annual meeting to be held in Nanjing, which has two meanings: ㈠ Nanjing has many new constructions, and new sights and insights can be discovered in addition to the meeting, and ㈡ Nanjing schools can provide considerate hospitality. However, in fact, the preparations were not very considerate, and I hope you will forgive me.</p>
<p>▲ Wu Yan Yin, representative of the Ministry of Education, gave a speech reporting on the work of the Ministry of Education in the field of children's education. The Ministry of Education has a General Education Department, which has been established for more than four years. The Second Division of the Department specializes in primary education matters. Recently, the primary school curriculum standards have been promulgated, except for the civic training standards, which are still to be sorted out. The success of this standard still depends on the support of the members of the Children's Education Society. Another thing that is being implemented is compulsory education, which has compiled the first phase of the short-term compulsory education implementation outline and distributed it to various provinces and cities, that is, to set up compulsory education experimental areas as a basis. The future work plans to stipulate the standards of various teaching tools and school tools, and still hope that members will give a lot of support. The Ministry of Education has three hopes for the Children's Education Society: ㈠ It is hoped that the society will study and research more on the misunderstandings of children's education in society, so that society can understand the meaning of child-centered education. ㈡ It is hoped that society will understand the importance of children's education. ㈢ We must find a way to save the country from the research of children's education. The members themselves are working hard in children's education, and at the same time, they must guide the comrades outside the society who are engaged in children's education to carry out together. Some people oppose child-centered education and think that it is romantic and indulgent, which is really wrong. In the Three Principles of the People, attention is paid to children's personality. Equality in civil rights is flat feet, not flat heads, so we must strive to correct general mistakes.</p>
<p>▲ Jin Chuzhen, representative of the Ministry of Health, gave a speech saying that the goal of this annual meeting is health education, so the Ministry of Health is very willing to join. The Ministry is very willing to do things for health education, compile various health teaching materials and tools, and health equipment, etc., and has sent staff to Europe and the United States to investigate health equipment and administration, in order to implement it after returning home. I hope you will give more advice.</p>
<p>▲ Huang Jianzhong, representative of Central University, gave a speech saying that I am attending the annual meeting this year and representing Zhongda to say a few words. I am here to supplement what Mr. Wu Yan Yin of the Ministry of Education said about child-centered, and education is to think for children everywhere. If the teaching materials, teaching tools, and all facilities, etc., I hope you will study and pay attention to this, and do not lose the original meaning of children's education.</p>
<p>▲ Hu Shuyi, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, gave a speech saying that today, I am here on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education to participate, and I have several opinions: ㈠ Your society is an academic station, and our bureau is an administrative organ. Education requires academic and administrative cooperation to progress, so our bureau hopes that your society will guide us at any time. ㈡ The progress of children's education can be divided into three aspects: 1. Family, 2. School, 3. Society. Your society seems to have put more effort into the second aspect in the past. In the future, I hope you can study more with the family and society, which is a blessing for the future of education in our country. ㈢ Children's education in the social aspect is especially important in cities.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Reading papers in the afternoon <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>丨 Hospitality from the Ministry of Education and the Central District Experimental School of Beijing</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00, a member paper reading session was held, chaired by Dong Renjian, in the following order:</p>
<p>㈠ Zheng Xiao "The Ideal of Health", ㈡ Chen Heqin "Children's Psychology and Mental Health", ㈢ Lei Zhenqing "The Scope of Mental Hygiene", ㈣ Xu Suen "Teaching Hygiene", ㈤ Ma Ketan "Elementary School Health Education", ㈥ Xu Benzhen "New Schools in Europe". After the above papers were read one by one, the members expressed their opinions, and they all had the insights of belonging, and the listeners were all moved. At 4:00, member Li Qingsong broadcasted the topic of Children's Health Education. At the same time, members went to the Central District Experimental School of Beijing to visit the exhibition of children's health education achievements. At 6:00, the 12th Experimental Primary School of the Capital hosted a public banquet for members at Laowanquan. In the evening, the Film Review Committee of the Compilation and Translation Hall of the Ministry of Education and the China Education Film Association hosted all members with refreshments in the auditorium of the Ministry of Education and screened to express welcome.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Tomorrow Morning's Event <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>

<p>The Gold Market is Confusing and Unpredictable</p>
<p>Good News at the End, Up 3.4 Taels Yesterday's market fluctuated drastically, making it difficult to predict. Industry players were bewildered, and supply and demand varied greatly, with a daily difference of 7.4 taels. However, the number of mid-term speculators remained low. The final increase of 3.4 taels did not affect the silver market, which initially declined due to the unchanged forward silver price. The sharp rise in US cotton also had an impact. Subsequently, foreign exchange trends diverged, with the British pound rising and the US dollar remaining stable. Active buying in the market led to soaring prices, reaching above 750 taels before slightly declining at the end. The complexity of the situation was unexpected. The Central Bank bought 105 cash bars at 52 taels, sold by Da De Cheng. Qian Chang Xiang transferred 28 bars to the bullish Tong Feng Heng at a discount of 7.5 fen in November, lower than before. Details of the day are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Morning Opening Down 2.9 Taels In early trading, the December opening price dropped 2.9 taels to 746.8 taels due to the near-soft, far-hard silver market. After fluctuating a few cents, Qian Chang Xiang, Yuan Mao Yong, Hong Kang Yong, Bing Xing, and others sold short-term British gold at 8.75 and 8.125. HSBC sold 120,000 pounds to Hua Bi and others, causing the gold price to drop to 6.3 taels. Heng Yu and others bought in, and Citibank absorbed January at 30 yuan, also buying British gold at 8.125, causing the price to rise 2 taels to 8.2 taels at 9:30 AM. HSBC announced that the British gold was up 0.125 and the US dollar was unchanged due to exchange rate arbitrage. However, Fu Yu, Yuan Tai, and Zhao Feng Chang sold out, bringing the price down to 6.88 taels by 9:50 AM. Later, HSBC absorbed January US dollars at 9.375 and British gold at 8.75, with Heng Yu and retail investors also buying in, gradually raising the price by more than 2 taels. Speculators only made a few cents until 10:30 AM, reaching 9.3 taels. Zhi Feng Yong and other gold firms sold out, causing a drop of 1.5 taels to 7.8 taels. At this point, Yi Feng Yong and retail short sellers bought in, and the Bank of China absorbed February at 30 yuan, with Mei Feng doing exchange rate arbitrage at 3.2825 yuan, pushing the price up to 9.6 taels. After 11:20 AM, Fu Yu and others tended to sell out, and Hua Bi released January US dollars at 9.375, causing the price to plunge more than 2 taels. However, the number of speculators was very small. By noon, the price closed at 6.8 taels.</p>
<p>▲Afternoon Market Sharply Bullish The afternoon market opened flat at 6.8 taels. Subsequently, Yuan Chun and Yuan Xing Yong bought in, and various firms rushed to buy US dollars at 9.375 for January, reaching 9.7 taels by 2:45 PM. Suddenly, Yuan Mao Yong and Tong Tai Chang sold out, causing a drop of 1.1 taels to 8.6 taels. At 3:00 PM, buying sentiment was very strong, with Fu Chang, Heng Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, etc., competing to buy. The December US dollar was traded at 8.125, further boosting the market, reaching 52.5 taels at 3:15 PM. After a short period, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Heng, and Heng Yu sold, suppressing the price by 1.5 taels, but there was no major change. Until 4:00 PM, the price was 51 taels, then it became bullish again because the February US dollar was traded at 8.75, and December was being pushed to 7.5. It was also reported that the Central Bank was buying 105 cash bars, causing Da De Cheng, Zhi Feng Yong, and Yi Feng and others to compete to buy, causing an instantaneous increase of more than 2 taels to 53.7 taels at 4:20 PM, exceeding yesterday's highest price. Unexpectedly, Dalian Bang took the opportunity to sell, and the February US dollar was traded at 9.375, causing a drop of 1 tael to 52.7 taels. By the 4:30 PM close, the price was 3.1 taels, up 3.4 taels from the 10th (the third consecutive day of gains). After the close, Heng Yu and Wan Xing followed suit, causing a setback in confidence and a drop to just over 51 taels, making it difficult to predict. The daily maximum was 53.7 taels, and the minimum was 46.3 taels, a difference of 7.4 taels. Therefore, the Gold Exchange has a double settlement price, and the bare bar only increased by 10 taels and 0.025 because the swap had narrowed.</p>
<p>▲Disclosure Price Reduced Again The disclosure price remained at 814 taels due to the unchanged US exchange rate, a pledge of 66-67 taels. Later, 64 taels, 67 taels at noon, then only 60 taels, and finally 61.2 taels, 3 taels less than the previous day. The accounting was 49 taels and 47 taels in the morning, 55 taels and 53 taels in the afternoon, and 47 taels for water replenishment in the afternoon, 53 taels.</p>
<p>▲Various Firms Buying and Selling Frequently There was considerable trading on the table, with industry players buying and selling. Statistics show that Heng Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Yuan Xing Yong, Da Xing Yong, Fu Yu, and Yuan Heng all bought in. Zhi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Bing Xing, Yong Feng, Fu Tai Heng, Yuan Tai, and Hong Kang Yong all sold out. Yuan Mao Yong hedged 300-400 bars. Da De Cheng hedged and sold. Tong Tai Chang, Shun Li, Fu Xing Yong, and Yuan Chun and Wan Xing's deposits and withdrawals were mixed, but the numbers were not large. In the afternoon, Fu Chang, Zhao Feng Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Fu Yu, Yong Feng, Fu Tai Heng, Bing Xing, Da De Cheng, Heng Chang Yong, Shun Li, and Yuan Chun and Ri Chang all bought in. Wan Xing, Tong Tai Chang, and Yi Feng Yong sold out. Yuan Tai, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Heng, and Chun Yuan Yong bought and sold. Heng Yu bought in first and then sold out, in large numbers. Dalian Bang sold a total of more than 500 bars and bought more than 300 bars. (Guang Bang (Heng Xing) observed the market in the morning and sold a little more than 200 bars in the afternoon. (Yi Feng) had a small number of deposits and withdrawals in the morning and bought 300 bars in the afternoon. The number of bars at each firm was slightly higher than before, approximately 29,000.</p>

<p>Although the silver market contracted yesterday, exchange rates continued to fall. However, the trend of Shanghai exchange rates diverged. HSBC's listed British gold rose by 0.125, and the US dollar suddenly changed. The remaining Hong Kong and Dutch exchanges remained unchanged, while others declined. The domestic market was initially flat but then rose, then fell again at noon, and was very bullish in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous day, British gold was flat, and the US dollar slightly contracted by 0.0625. However, the gold price rose by more than 3 taels, so the hedged spread had slightly narrowed. Various banks traded actively, with more than 100,000 pounds of British gold being traded. Gold firms had little activity, and banks did considerable trading with each other. Sassoon &amp; Co. settled forward contracts, and silver companies sold short-term contracts. Approximately more than 1 million US dollars were traded. Chinese firms had varying deposits and withdrawals in the morning and bought extensively in the afternoon. Cheng Feng Yong settled more. Silver companies sold a small amount in January. Various banks, such as Hua Bi, sold positions, and HSBC bought slightly. Other banks did considerable trading with each other. Mei Feng did British-US exchange rate arbitrage, selling US dollars at 29.8125 for December and buying shillings at 19.75, equivalent to 3.2825 silver taels. The transaction prices in the morning and afternoon are described below:</p>
<p>▲British Exchange Rates The domestic market fluctuated by 0.125 throughout the day, with the morning asking price being 9.6875 pence for November, 75 for December, 8125 for January, 875 for February, and 9375 for March.

<p>Unified Salt Tax Recovers by One Yuan</p>
<p>丨Other Fluctuations are Minimal, Trend is Peaceful丨</p>
<p>丨Turnover Totals Only Over Six Million Five Hundred Thousand丨</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 11th), the market conditions of various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, spot transactions were scarce, with only 5,000 yuan traded throughout the day. The futures market was also far inferior to the previous day. As the trend has become stable, buying and selling have also gradually dispersed. The morning session's turnover totaled over 3.6 million yuan, and the afternoon session totaled 2.9 million yuan, totaling 6.58 million yuan. Among them, salt tax accounted for 1.7 million yuan, unified tax 1.01 million yuan, and the 20 Customs, Rolled Tobacco, Disbandment, and 19 Customs bonds each accounted for 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. The Sixth Customs bond market was very quiet. The 96 Financial bond market had no activity. Market sentiment was unstable, and prices fluctuated based on temporary supply and demand conditions. Therefore, the trend was unusually chaotic, with rises and falls being unpredictable. Observing the market situation, large-scale transactions by major players will temporarily come to an end, and significant price fluctuations are unlikely to occur in the coming days. Yesterday, the salt tax recovered by about 1.10 yuan, the unified tax for the next month rose by one yuan, the near-term rose by six jiao, and other futures contracts had mixed gains and losses, all of which were minimal.</p>

<p>A report from the New Feng Yang Company stated that on Thursday (the 10th), the New York stock market showed a firm trend and favorable news.

Overall, various stocks rose by 3.5 yuan or more. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 1.6 million. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Index | Closing Price | Change from Previous Day |</p>

<p>Cotton Yarn's Rising Momentum is Weak</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is trending upward due to the rise in American cotton and positive market sentiment. Short sellers are covering their positions, and the market is showing signs of strength again. However, most believe that the environment is not good and that there is still no large-scale sales volume. There are still many who sell on rallies. However, Rongjiang (a yarn brand) long positions are quiet and inactive. Although American cotton has risen, exports are still sluggish, which is somewhat unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>▲ Renbiao (a yarn brand) Rebounds After Rising, Returns to Pre-Rise Levels: The market opened with a surge in American cotton, and market sentiment was tight. Sellers were also scarce in the market, causing prices to rise by 9 qian to 1 liang and 1 qian for all months. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand was weak and the situation turned sluggish again, with prices slightly falling by 1, 2, or 3 qian for all months. The total turnover for the day was 20,900 bales. Chang Feng sold 1,050 bales, Chang Ji 650 bales, Yi Yu 650 bales, Geng Feng 650 bales, and Ren Feng 500 bales. Ming De bought 1,600 bales, Shen Ji 850 bales, Xie Sheng 1,300 bales, Da Feng 550 bales, and Da Chang Cheng 550 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Category | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Renbiao Closing | N/A | Up 7.38 | 21449 |</p>
<p>| November | 14.30 | Up 8.4 | 10031458 |</p>
<p>| December | 14.3896 | Up 4.55 | 78400 |</p>
<p>| January | 14.4381 | N/A | 282550 |</p>
<p>▲Spot Yarn Sales Show Slight Movement: The disposal of spot yarn still shows no improvement. Sichuan merchants have made some purchases. It is recorded that various merchants only purchased 391 bales throughout the day. Prices increased by 5 to 7.5 qian. The amounts purchased by each region are listed below:</p>
<p>| Region | Bales | Region | Bales |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Sichuan | 225 | Shantou | 30 |</p>
<p>| Zhenjiang | 5 | Ningbo | 1 |</p>
<p>| Inland | 85 | Nanjing | 5 |</p>

<h3 id="e143">Cotton Follows American Cotton's Bullish Outlook <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market rose sharply, showing a strong trend, due to the rise in American cotton. According to private sources, there is talk of a bullish outlook, so market sentiment is particularly nervous. However, a certain manufacturer unloaded a large amount, which has not been covered. Various sources of supply remain scarce, mainly because prices at the origin are high, making it difficult to make a profit when they arrive in Shanghai. However, with yarn prices weakening daily, factories are not actively purchasing. Therefore, although foreign cotton has risen, there is still no drastic change in the market.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Biao (a cotton brand) Recovers by Half a Liang: Zheng Biao opened with a rise in American cotton, short sellers covering their positions, and market sentiment was firm again. Prices rose by 4 or 5 qian for all months. In the afternoon, near-term months rose by an additional 5 fen to 1 qian, while far-term months fell by 5 fen. The total turnover for the day was 80,700 dan. Feng sold 4,100 dan, Shen Chang 2,000 dan, Ren Feng 2,300 dan, Chang Feng 3,700 dan, and Tong Xing 1,600 dan. Ming De bought 1,900 dan, Ji Feng 2,300 dan, Xie Sheng 2,400 dan, Yong Da 3,100 dan, and Yuan Da 2,400 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>| Category | Closing Price | Change | Inventory |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Zheng Biao Closing | N/A | Up 5.013 | 23155 |</p>
<p>| November | 30.90 | Up 5.01376 | 83600 |</p>

<p>| January | 31.2045 | N/A | 904600 |</p>
<p>▲Spot Cotton Mill Demand Gradually Activates: The spot cotton business is gradually moving, and mill demand is developing. The source includes 694 bales of Yao flower and 956 bales of Tong flower. The sales records are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose due to strong activity on Wall Street, foreign merchants buying, and a lack of sellers. The market was quiet and firm, with futures rising 30 to 35 points and spot prices rising 30 points. British cotton futures rose 7-8 points, while spot prices fell 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 16 points. Indian cotton was sluggish and lacked distinct characteristics. Pingguoer fell 6 rupees, Aomula fell 6.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 9 rupees.

<p>Rice Market Reaches Sluggish Sales</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a large arrival of white japonica rice in South Shanghai. Yesterday, numbers 53 and 54 arrived. The appetite in Benjie Street and the surrounding areas is not very lively. The price of white japonica and thin rice has been reduced by two or three jiao. Given this situation, market sentiment is becoming unstable again. Although the appetite in Bianyuanfang is moving, it is only slightly.</p>
<p>▲In North Shanghai, the source of supply from various merchants was about 60 numbers yesterday. Transactions between the city and the countryside are becoming sluggish daily. Due to the cloudy and rainy weather, the canal market opened with about 1,000 dan. The opening prices of Wuxi and Changzhou rice were reduced by two or three jiao for early and late rice, and one jiao for Bianyuan, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Hunan and Jiangxi Rice Continues to Arrive at 2,000 Bags <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>丨Fujian Merchants Revive Procurement丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for foreign客秈rice were sluggish, and prices continued to weaken. The appetite in Benjie Street was completely stagnant. 客帮 merchants had some appetite, but ultimately hesitated due to the high prices. After the recent weakening of market prices, there is a renewed trend of activity. Yesterday, a Fuzhou merchant purchased 500 bags of Hunan machine-milled Jing rice for 8 yuan, 4 jiao and 4 fen, which is about half a yuan lower than the highest price in previous days. A Beiyang merchant tentatively purchased 100 bags of small絞rice for 7 yuan and 7 jiao, which is one jiao lower than the previous day. Since the clearance of Hunan rice, there have been some arrivals at the port. Yesterday, another 2,000 bags arrived, and 300 bags of Jiangxi rice also arrived. However, the recent客化is sluggish and prices have fallen. The Hunan rice that arrived a few days ago has not yet been sold through. After the arrival of another batch yesterday, the accumulation of inventory in the market is gradually increasing. A large amount of客化is needed for a gradual increase in prices to materialize.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Flour Market Falls Back After Being Lively <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for each month rose slightly by one or two jiao due to slightly better quotations for foreign wheat. Moreover, because the factories were unwilling to release inventory, market sentiment became lively after the opening. Due to the rejection by major factories, the current month was not released. For longer-term contracts, foreign customers and speculators in the market bought briskly. Short sellers also took the opportunity to cover their positions. Therefore, the opening prices for each contract rose by one or two fen compared to the previous day. March was the fastest rising, due to more active buying by outside parties. By the afternoon opening, market sentiment for November and December was still stable, but for longer-term contracts, prices gradually fell back. It was heard that Fuxin had begun selling, with approximately 100,000 bags being sold. The prices for Australian wheat were low. It was heard that local factories had jointly booked another ship, priced at only 3 taels, 4 qian and 5 fen and a half (or a rumored 4 qian and a half). Given this situation, there is still a surplus overseas, and it is likely that this is only a temporary excitement. As a result, November and December were better by 7.5 li, January was better by 5 li, February was better by 7.5 li, and March was better by 2.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Wheat Market Remains Relatively Stable <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>丨Another Ship of Australian Wheat Booked丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market was generally stable. With foreign wheat quotations slightly better by about one or two jiao, people generally believed that the market had very few chips, and physical goods were never locked in. Therefore, outside customers generally believed that scarce goods were valuable, and their thinking was firm. They were unaware that the prices for Australian wheat were becoming cheaper step by step. If the prices were raised excessively, the subsequent reaction would be unthinkable. For example, the Australian wheat that was set yesterday was heard to be only 3 taels, 4 qian and 5 fen and a half. After removing the upgrades and converting to the standard, there would be a profit. Therefore, amid the falling world prices, it is best to follow the trend. As a result, November was better by 1 fen, February was better by 3 fen, March was better by 2 fen, and there were no other gains or losses. The spot wheat market was quiet due to both arrivals and sales being inactive, and there were no speculative trades.</p>
<h3 id="e157">There is Little Change in Coarse Sand White Sugar Market <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little fluctuation in the gold standard and Dutch exchange rate. The trends on the guild's trading board were still relatively stable. The initial bid for No. 24 coarse sand leaving the warehouse was 14 taels, 8 qian and a half, while the bid entering the warehouse was only 14 taels and 8 qian. Later, a transaction was completed at 8 qian and 2.5 fen, with slight movements in and out. There were few transactions for No. 20 and No. 18 medium sand white sugar and No. 89 and No. 90 Dutch red sugar, and there were few gains or losses. From the perspective of foreign firms, Wah Shing offered several hundred bags of semi-dry cotton Dutch white sugar, priced at 15 taels and 2 qian. A Chaozhou firm offered a newly arrived batch of Huizhou white sugar, totaling 163 bags. The goods were of good quality, and the price was set at 15 taels, with a very firm original market. The market for Jianbing was not smooth, and although there was price negotiation, it did not come close, resulting in a lack of transactions.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market in local foreign firms continued to be firm. Although overseas silk prices were reported to have risen, the telegraphic transfer prices from Europe and America were still 70-80 taels different from the cost of Chinese silk. Chinese merchants still found it difficult to sell. Only silk used for silk fabrics continued to see transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e171">The Pioneer of Catholicism in Korea Was Chinese <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>On Christmas Day of 1794 (i.e., the 59th year of the Qianlong reign), how many Korean believers joyfully waited at the border for the arrival of Korea's first priest? In the dim twilight, a disguised Korean indeed arrived. His attire included a bamboo hat and straw sandals. His hairstyle and clothing were just like those of a native Korean. However, he was born in Changshu, Jiangsu, with the surname Zhou and the given name Jacob! The pioneer of Catholicism in Korea was Chinese!</p>
<p>Priest Zhou learned the Korean language and founded the Mingdao Society. He also translated books on doctrine, preaching with the attitude of a scholar. Within six years, he gained six thousand believers! He got along very well with the locals. However, this good priest ultimately "sacrificed himself for righteousness."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it coincided with the death of King Jeongjo of Korea, and powerful ministers seized power, destroying the church! Priest Zhou originally planned to return to China, seeking refuge at the border between China and Korea. However, he received a divine revelation to return to the capital via the same route.</p>
<p>One day, at the third crow of the rooster, a person in plain clothes with a silk fan, his beard and hair neatly arranged, arrived at the prison and confessed: "I am the Chinese priest Zhou Jacob, whom you have been searching for throughout the country. I came to Korea for no other reason than to preach the Holy Catholic Church and save the souls of the entire nation! Now I have come to surrender myself." The interrogating official sentenced him to death! Later, the Korean king apologized to the Chinese court.</p>
<p>In 1801 (i.e., the 6th year of the Jiaqing reign), at 4:00 PM, the execution was carried out. The weather suddenly changed, with thunder and lightning crisscrossing the sky. The audience at the execution ground was extremely terrified. However, the one being sacrificed, Korea's first priest, calmly faced his death, saying to the audience:</p>
<p>"I am dying today for preaching the Holy Catholic Church. I forewarn the public: in the future, Korea will face great disasters. Only then will Koreans remember me!"</p>

<p>— Jin Butong</p>
<p>丨View the affairs of the world as such丨</p>
<p>The Japanese army spent two days annexing my three northeastern provinces, without even breaking a sweat, as easy as pie. Then, General Ma Zhanshan rose up in resistance, followed by volunteer armies, self-defense forces, national salvation armies, national defense armies, and countless unnamed armies, launching attacks on weak points and avoiding strong ones, making feints to the east and attacking in the west, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, leaving the Japanese and puppet troops overwhelmed. In Japan, they originally thought they had single-handedly created a puppet regime, and the situation was set, but who knew it would end up like this. Their Foreign Minister Shidehara said: "Annexing Manchuria is like swallowing a bomb." This statement is</p>
<p>Absolutely correct. Now, because of the Japanese invasion of my Northeast, the domestic economy is in a state of panic, and the dissatisfaction of the great powers is deepening day by day. However, due to concerns about face, Japan cannot easily give up. Although the future is full of dangers, they have no choice but to persevere. This situation perfectly matches an old saying, "Easy to get on stage, difficult to get off."</p>
<p>Because of this situation, I was reminded of the issue of education. After graduating from elementary school, one has to borrow money to enter middle school. After graduating from middle school, one has to borrow money to enter university. After graduating from university, one has to borrow money to study abroad. Knowing that climbing up level by level through debt may not guarantee a promising future, but having arrived at an awkward situation, one has no choice. This is also "Easy to get on stage, difficult to get off." Getting to be of marriageable age, one has to marry a wife. After marrying a wife, expenses increase day by day, and creditors become more pressing day by day. Logically, only returning to the life of a bachelor is a solution, but due to face, one has no choice but to endure the pain and persevere. Only when it becomes impossible to maintain, one has to sell land and property. Regarding the wife who extorts rice and oil from him, he still refuses to give up and perseveres with a stiff upper lip. This is also "Easy to get on stage, difficult to get off." All affairs in the world should be viewed as such.</p>

<p>— Xiao Fang</p>
<p>丨I don't believe you are completely unmoved丨</p>
<p>It was a late autumn day, but Shanghai has no seasons丨</p>
<p>The San You Industrial Society was full of people, clearly all our compatriots. The shop assistants were busily attending to each customer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a middle-aged Japanese woman, leading a twelve- or thirteen-year-old child, appeared in the crowd. Astonishment crept into the hearts of every compatriot: "The Japanese are the most patriotic people, how come she is running into our national goods company to buy our things?" Thus, countless gazes fell upon her.</p>
<p>The woman opened her mouth, speaking in our Great Republic of China's language:</p>
<p>"Sir丨 Please select the most durable and beautiful fabrics, those that your compatriots like the most, and show them to me丨"</p>
<p>The child, with a resentful look, followed behind the woman:</p>
<p>"Mother! Have you forgotten that you are a citizen of Great Japan? How can you buy Chinese goods?丨 Are you my mother?···" Flames flickered in the child's eyes.</p>
<p>"No丨 Child丨" The woman turned her head and said softly: "I am not buying Chinese fabrics to make my own clothes丨 I want to take the fabrics that Chinese people like and send them back so that our compatriots can manufacture them in the same way, and then sell them back to the Chinese. You must know: child丨 If our goods can only supply our own compatriots and we don't think about catering to other people's psychology to promote them more, there is no hope for development, child丨 I know: I am a part of Great Japan, my blood is the property of Great Japan, and I still want to pass this property down to my descendants. Child丨 How could I forget my origins? Otherwise, would I still be worthy of being your mother?······"</p>
<p>The child smiled slightly, but our compatriots silently fell into despondency.</p>

<h3 id="e176">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Four Warehouses Pledged to an American Merchant</p>
<p>China General Business Company Accepts the Mortgage</p>
<p>A Total of 10 Million Silver Dollars Mortgaged</p>
<p>The Warehouses Affairs Section Was Renamed Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which the government has resolved to nationalize, suddenly experienced a major incident yesterday. The company's General Manager, Li Guojie, agreed with the China General Business Company on Sichuan Road in this city to borrow 10 million silver dollars and hand over the company's four warehouses, namely the Zong, Hua, Bei, and Xin, to the company for continued operation. The transfer was completed yesterday afternoon. There was a dispute over the transfer before, but by the afternoon, the China General Business Company had sent personnel to carry out the transfer. The details of this case are summarized below.</p>
<p>▲ The Loan Process: Since Li Guojie became the General Manager, he has felt that the company's finances are extremely tight. From time to time, certain financial groups have expressed their intention to invest. After consulting with Li, it was decided to mortgage the Hua, Bei, Xin, and Zong warehouses for 10 million silver dollars (some say 15 million silver dollars) and hand over the four warehouses to the financial group for management and continued operation. The draft agreement was signed in September of this year.</p>
<p>▲ Contract Suddenly Signed: The Executive Yuan's 75th meeting recently resolved that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company would continue to be operated by the government and planned to prepare funds to redeem the shares held by merchants. After this news spread, Li, believing that the company's remaining assets could still be freely disposed of, signed a loan agreement with the American China General Business Company this week, using the four warehouses as collateral. The company's personnel are well aware of this case. The contents of the contract are extremely confidential, and outsiders have no way of finding out.</p>
<p>▲ Unsuccessful Transfer: On the afternoon of the 9th, General Manager Li sent the company's staff member Wang Yunzhang, along with four foreigners sent by the creditor, to the manager's office of the four warehouses in Hongkou to take over the four docks from Manager Ling Jingshan. Wang presented the official document from the company ordering the handover and ordered Ling to sign it. The four foreigners were waiting to take over, but Ling refused to hand over the docks because he had not received an order from the ministry, and he firmly refused. The transfer was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>▲ Changing the Warehouse Manager: After this refusal, Ling took a half-month leave. Li then appointed Yang Ruinian as the warehouse manager of the four warehouses. On the 10th, Yang went to the four warehouses to take over, but Ling also refused to hand over the position. It was not until the morning of the 11th that Ling Jingshan left the warehouses. Yang Ruinian then took office as the manager of the four warehouses at noon, but the foreigners who were to take over the mortgage did not go to take over either.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Ministry to Stop: Ling Jingshan first reported to the new General Manager Liu Hongsun, who ordered him to report the details to the Ministry of Communications via telegram, requesting an order to stop the company's assets from falling into the hands of foreigners. The mortgagees, unable to take over the docks, had the four foreign staff members who had been sent to report back to the foreigner who was holding the mortgage and the financial group. On one hand, they stopped paying the money, and on the other hand, they filed a complaint with the company. This matter has caused various disputes.</p>
<p>▲ Ling's Determination: Ling Jingshan, director of the Warehouse Affairs Section of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, stating: "Shen Bao, I have refused to hand over the position, and various parties have criticized me, believing that I am reluctant to leave the position of Section Chief. I have already resigned from the position of Section Chief to Li Guojie and returned the letter of appointment from the manager of the China General Business Company in order to thank the people of the country. I am now going to Wuhan to take up the position of Chief Auditor at the Rural Financial Relief Office of Hubei and Anhui."</p>
<p>▲ Transfer Yesterday: On the afternoon of the 11th, Hong Dezhao, the deputy section chief of the China General Business Company, was sent to take over. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency inquired in the afternoon. According to a person in charge of the company, the transfer had been completed by the China General Business Company and would operate as usual from today.</p>
<p>▲ Renaming the Warehouse Section: The manager's office of the four warehouses of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (i.e., the Warehouse Affairs Section) located at No. 302 East Broadway Road was renamed the China General Business Company yesterday, and Hong Dezhao, the deputy section chief of the Warehouse Affairs Section of the company, was appointed by the company to continue in the position of director. The China General Business Company is fully responsible for all internal and external matters. There have been no changes to the internal personnel for the time being.</p>
<p>▲ Changing Opinions: After this incident occurred, it caused significant attention from all parties. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed a standing director of the company, whose nationalization had already been decided by the government, to inquire about his opinion. According to him, the government's decision to nationalize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was originally to develop China's shipping industry. Today, this major incident has occurred at the company. Before we receive an appointment order, we cannot express anything, but the government must have a way to deal with this kind of illegal activity, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Appointment Order Will Be Issued: According to another director, the appointment orders for the supervisors and directors regarding the nationalization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be issued by the National Government within a few days. The government will handle the case of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's mortgage of the warehouses, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Employee Meeting: Upon hearing the news that the four docks had been mortgaged, all the employees of the five docks felt that mortgaging the four docks was tantamount to selling them off in disguise and that this small amount of Chinese shipping industry would be lost invisibly. The livelihoods of the employees of the five docks might be affected. At 5:00 PM yesterday, all the members of the union demanded that a general meeting be convened. The union then convened an emergency joint meeting of all the group leaders of the five docks. After the standing director of the union reported the truth of the matter, all the group leaders discussed how to respond. As a result, the following three measures were decided: (1) How should we respond to the mortgage of the docks, which affects the livelihoods and future of the employees? It was decided that opposing the mortgage should be the highest principle and guaranteeing livelihoods should be the minimum requirement. As for the method of action, the first step should be for all the group leaders to go to the company to petition, and the last resort should be a strike by all the members. (2) How should we express our opinion regarding the National Government's reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company? It was decided that a general meeting of all the members of the five docks should be convened at a set time to make a decision. (3) Regarding the issue of October's salary, it was decided to include a demand for its payment when the petition is submitted. The meeting was then adjourned, and it was planned that all the group leaders would go to the company to petition on Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Zhu Hexiang Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Will Go to Nanyang to Investigate Consulates</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due to conflicting opinions between consulates in various parts of Nanyang and local overseas Chinese, and having repeatedly received documents accusing various consuls, has specially dispatched Zhu Hexiang, Director of the International Department, to conduct an investigation in order to rectify the situation. Zhu arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and is packing his luggage in preparation for departure.</p>
<p>▲ Motivation for Investigation: Overseas Chinese are most numerous in the various territories of Nanyang. In recent years, due to the global economic downturn, overseas Chinese merchants have felt the negative impact. At the same time, some unscrupulous elements among the consuls in various places have neglected their duty to protect overseas Chinese and have engaged in profit-seeking activities. The Ministry has received numerous cases accusing various consuls. Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Wengan, in his indignation, ordered the dismissal and investigation of Su, the Consul General in San Francisco, and Liang, the Consul in Medan. On the one hand, Zhu Hexiang, Director of the International Department, was dispatched to Nanyang to conduct an investigation in order to engage in rectification and reform. At the same time, he will make every effort to find ways to alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>▲ Place of Departure: After Zhu was ordered to go to Shanghai, the date of departure has not yet been determined, but it will not be too far off, roughly no later than the 20th of this month. Only Secretary Zhou Bofu will accompany him. All the procedures have been entrusted to the China Travel Service to handle. It is heard that Zhu will first go to Hong Kong to inspect Annam, then go through India, Singapore, Yangon, to Sumatra, Penang, Batavia, Calcutta, Medan, and then return to China via Siam. It is expected to take three and a half months. He will stay in each place for at least five days in order to fully accept the complaints of overseas Chinese and to inspect whether the consuls in each place are able to fulfill their duties. If there is sufficient time, he also intends to go to Manila.</p>
<p>▲ Consular Visa Matters: Since China implemented consular visa requirements for cargo manifests, the revenue situation has been quite good. According to the statistics for the first month, the total amount remitted to Beijing by consuls in various places was about 60,000 yuan. The amount collected by the customs was also 40,000 yuan, for a total of about 100,000 yuan. China has more than 80 consulates abroad. In Nanyang, there are about five in the Dutch colonies and four in the British colonies. Due to the delay in the commercial treaty with Vietnam, there has been no confirmation of the establishment of a consulate in French Annam, so there is no consulate there at this time. Regarding consular visas, except for Siam, where Chairman Zheng of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce has been entrusted to act as an agent, it is also planned to contact Chairman Hong of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in French Annam after Zhu arrives and entrust him to act as an agent.</p>
<p>▲ Rumors About the CER: Regarding rumors that Russia will transfer its rights over the Chinese Eastern Railway to France or Japan, it was heard yesterday that these rumors were completely propaganda created by the Japanese side. Although the Chinese Eastern Railway is nominally a joint Sino-Russian venture, the French also have a stake in it. This is because the railway was completed with French loans during the Tsarist era. After the Russian Revolution, the socialist Soviet government completely refused to acknowledge this loan, effectively defaulting on the debt. In 1907, after the Franco-Japanese Agreement was concluded, France recognized Japan's vested interests in Manchuria, and Japan also recognized France's vested interests in Yunnan and Guangxi, forming a secret collusion between France and Japan. Therefore, after the Northeast Incident, France and Japan still made proposals based on this agreement. However, France, in view of its recent position in Europe, has gradually felt threatened by Germany's demand for equal arms reduction. At the same time, the United States needed to court Britain and France on the Far East issue. As a result, France abandoned Japan and sided with the United States and Britain. Therefore, Japan's position in the Far East suddenly became isolated, and it had no choice but to send Matsuoka abroad to lobby and create rumors that Soviet Russia would transfer its rights over the Chinese Eastern Railway to France and Japan in order to deceive the world into believing that Russia and Japan were friendly. At the same time, it is proceeding with the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with Soviet Russia, but Russia and Japan are fundamentally incompatible. Therefore, Matsuoka's trip to Russia will not be successful, etc.</p>

<p>Ban on Export of Rice to the Northeast</p>
<p>Goods Imported into the Northeast Must Be Taxed</p>
<p>Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Lawford, Customs Commissioner, issued the 1255th joint notice yesterday, stating that they were issuing a joint notice regarding the government's order that the export of rice to Dalian and the ports of the three northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang be temporarily prohibited. In accordance with this, we must comply. All merchants are hereby notified.</p>
<p>Another 1256th notice was issued, stating that it was a joint notice regarding the measures for levying taxes on goods transported to and from the ports of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces, which were already on record in the 1241st notice on September 23 of this year. All goods transported from Andong and Niuzhuang that are considered foreign goods, and all goods transported from Dalian, regardless of whether they are declared for transshipment to other ports or stored in customs warehouses, must be subject to import tax. All merchants are hereby notified. Tang Haian, Superintendent, and Lawford, Customs Commissioner, November 10, the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Road Construction Beyond the Concession Boundary <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Telephone Case to Be Signed</p>
<p>The Agreement is Valid for One Year</p>
<p>The Great American Evening Post stated that in the temporary agreement signed between the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, an additional burden of 12,000 taels was added. This agreement, which is being implemented on a trial basis for one year, has been approved by the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. The 12,000 taels it bears is for the telephones installed along the roads built beyond the concession boundary, with an annual payment of 12 yuan per telephone to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and 60 yuan per telephone installed in houses outside the roads built beyond the concession boundary in the Hongkou area. In addition, a few telephones outside the roads built beyond the concession boundary in western Shanghai, with an annual payment of 30 yuan per telephone, are also included. However, only users who pay a special police donation to the Municipal Council will have their payments made by the company. According to the Shanghai Telephone Company, it paid 10,000 yuan to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau for this year before June 1. Now that a method has been agreed upon, it is not yet known whether the payments after June will be paid accordingly. Although the agreement stipulates that it will be implemented on a trial basis for one year, it can be revised at any time after the issue of road construction beyond the concession boundary is resolved. A formal notice of the Municipal Council's approval of the agreement has been received. Once the Shanghai Telephone Company is notified, a date will be set for formal signing. As for a permanent agreement, the Public Utilities Bureau staff expressed their hope that it could be negotiated during this one-year trial period.</p>

<p>There is Hope for a Turnaround</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Asks the Real Estate Association for Cooperation</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency stated that regarding the water supply problem, the Municipal Council, the Water Company, and the Real Estate Association plan to hold a meeting to negotiate a solution. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency interviewed Li Bohan, a Standing Committee member of the Real Estate Association, yesterday to inquire about the recent developments in the water supply problem. Mr. Li said that after the Public Concession installed water meters, the water prices have exceeded the original prices by seven or eight times, especially in the Yangshupu area. The owners cannot afford the water bills, and the Water Company has a rebate system to temporarily remedy the situation, which is unfair. The association has repeatedly protested and put forward a fundamental proposition on water prices. The current concession authorities are well aware of the difficulties of the real estate industry. Through mediation, representatives from the Municipal Council, the Water Company, and the association will be appointed to negotiate a solution. The association has a written statement and has appointed Yan Fang and Dou Yaoting as representatives to attend.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association received a letter from the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "We received your letter of October 14 regarding the water supply of Longji Lane. The humble and reasonable attitude adopted by your association in this matter is admirable to this bureau. The bureau is now fully aware of the various difficulties faced by your association regarding the current water prices. We hope to exchange various opinions on this issue from time to time so that all misunderstandings can be resolved with the cooperation and assistance of your association.</p>

<p>Implement Relief Rice Prices</p>
<p>Use of 3 Million Yuan Pledge Funds</p>
<p>After the Jiangsu-Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Association Committee met in Shanghai on the 3rd and 4th of this month, it sent representatives Qian Sunqing, Yu Xiaochuan, Wang Xiaolai, and Lu Wenshao to Minister Song's residence with a petition. Minister Song agreed to meet them and expressed three points: (1) Domestic free circulation can be carried out as planned. (2) Taxation on imported foreign rice will be explained to the Guangdong authorities to clear up misunderstandings, and it can be implemented. (3) Taxation on imported American wheat will still be considered. About 400,000 tons of wheat have been borrowed this time, etc. The representatives made a presentation on the American wheat issue. The 3 million yuan in funds for rice and grain mortgages negotiated by the association with the banking industry has now been decided. In counties where the China Communications Farmers Bank and other banks are present, they will be jointly managed by each bank. In counties where only the Farmers Bank is present, it will be managed by the Farmers Bank. In counties where no bank is present, the responsible persons in each county will formulate concrete measures and contact neighboring counties or Shanghai. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the local association will be responsible for the relief of rice prices in Songjiang, Qingpu, and Jinshan counties. Letters have been sent to the magistrates of Jinshan, Songqing, and the heads of the two Farmers Banks, informing local enthusiasts that if funds are needed for relief rice and grain, they can be informed at any time and assistance will be provided. The Wu County and Wuxi Chambers of Commerce will be responsible for the nine counties of Wu County, Kunshan, Changshu, Wujiang, Wujin, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Yixing, and Liyang. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce and the Provincial Farmers Bank will be responsible for the six counties of Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jianing, Jurong, Lishui, and Gaochun. The Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation will be responsible for the ten counties of Jiangdu, Gaoyou, Bin Ying, Dongtai, Xinghua, Taixian, Yancheng, Huaian, Rugao, and Taixing. It is heard that they are also proceeding separately, which is truly good news for the future of civil food in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Powerful Overseas Chinese Figures <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Preparing for the Overseas Chinese Association</p>
<p>Chen Wulie Sends Letters to Overseas Chinese in Various Ports</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are the most important people in the history of the Republic of China. In short, they are the elements that created the Republic of China. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen especially praised overseas Chinese as the mother of the revolution, which is worthy of the name. Most of the strength of the revolutionary army was funded by overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese cannot bear the harsh treatment of foreign races and are subjected to spiritual stimulation. They are determined to strengthen themselves and hope for the invigoration of the motherland. They do not hesitate to give up their homes and donate money to help the revolutionary army. However, after the revolutionary army succeeded, it was not able to redress even the slightest shame for overseas Chinese and devise a plan for their protection. This is what overseas Chinese are most disappointed and saddened by. Recently, in the case of the expulsion of Chinese from Mexico, overseas Chinese suffered losses of tens of millions, were displaced, and were in a miserable situation. The government was unable to maintain order, and the so-called benefactors and philanthropists in the country did not care. As a result, the tens of thousands of overseas Chinese in Mexico who had sacrificed for the party and the country were left to be slaughtered and were deported back to the country in batches. This is also the most unfortunate thing for overseas Chinese. However, there are also reasons for the adverse environment faced by overseas Chinese and their failure to achieve their goals in the motherland. The reason is that there is no truly linked and mutually supportive organization to provide effective support in the motherland. Moreover, during times of national crisis, overseas Chinese need such an organization even more to be the main driving force for self-salvation and national salvation. The most important place in the motherland is Shanghai. Shanghai is the center of economics and politics in the Far East and the area where overseas Chinese enter and leave the most. It is appropriate for both people and location to establish an overseas Chinese liaison organization here. Therefore, some powerful overseas Chinese figures in Shanghai, seeing this, have launched the Overseas Chinese Association. The details of the process have been recorded in previous newspapers, and its main figures are Zheng Hongnian, Tang Haian, Guo Shun, Wu Chengyu, and others from the political, business, and academic circles of overseas Chinese. Its content and organization are very strict and orderly, and it is a model for organizing social groups at sea. The process of its operation is recorded below in detail. The organization of the Overseas Chinese Association is divided into three stages: (1) The temporary preparatory period, which is dedicated to soliciting founders (hoping to reach 1,000 people) to strengthen its basic strength. (2) The preparatory period, actively promoting and launching a large-scale membership recruitment campaign in order to expand its own scope. (3) The establishment period, carrying out practical work to save the country and protect overseas Chinese, the first step is to make Shanghai a model area for saving the country, and the second step is to find ways to relieve the distressed or unemployed overseas Chinese in general, in order to realize its means of saving the country and protecting overseas Chinese and to complete an organization that truly struggles for the interests of overseas Chinese, in order to win the sympathy of the majority of overseas Chinese. If this plan can be carried out one by one, the reputation of the Overseas Chinese Association will not only be admired by overseas Chinese overseas, but also respected by the Chinese people. We sincerely hope that the founders of the association will work hard to achieve it. It is now heard that Mr. Chen Wulie, a giant in the Nanyang overseas Chinese community who recently returned to China, has also been aroused by the organization of the Overseas Chinese Association. To seek happiness for overseas Chinese and not let others do it, he has volunteered to organize a powerful overseas Chinese organization in Shanghai in order to realize his long-cherished wish to protect overseas Chinese, which shows that the establishment of an overseas Chinese organization in Shanghai is attracting the attention of overseas Chinese from all parties. Mr. Chen is currently residing at No. 70 Rue Amiral d'Estaing in the French Concession. The circular he is preparing to send to various ports is recorded below for quick viewing. The original letter reads: "Dear Sirs, In recent years, our country has been unfortunate, with internal and external troubles following one after another. The drought in Shaanxi and Gansu the year before last, the floods in Anhui and Hubei last year, and the loss of the Eastern Provinces on September 18 and the battle of Shanghai on January 28, our overseas Chinese compatriots have always rushed to the front, vying to donate. The government only sent a commissioner to comfort them and never took into account the interests of the overseas Chinese themselves. If the huge sums of money donated each time were used for public purposes, it would be pleasing to everyone. However, the money is sent to different people, and there is no organization in the country to supervise its use. As a result, the funds earned by the sweat of the overseas Chinese are wasted in vain, which is by no means a small amount. This is what Wulie has recently heard and learned since returning to China, and it is something that our overseas Chinese compatriots never dreamed of. Now that the country is in trouble, it depends on the efforts of the people at home and abroad to save it. However, we cannot give up eating because of choking. The only way to remedy the situation is to quickly establish a powerful overseas Chinese organization in Shanghai to serve as our eyes and ears. In this way, there will be no fear that future remittances to the country will be seized by unscrupulous people. Moreover, at a time when the world is facing financial panic and the collapse of production, it is especially important to seek a retreat in the country for the sake of the future of overseas Chinese so that the unemployed can avoid becoming refugees. However, this matter is too important to be accomplished without the joint efforts of everyone. Wulie will first go to Beijing and Wuhan in the next few days to visit the authorities and request that the power of the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong in terms of construction be entrusted to our impartial overseas Chinese who return to the country to take office so that the country's resources can be gradually developed, so that there is no wasteland and the people are not idle, and then there will be no bandits, and the local area can achieve good governance. At the same time, we should request the National Government to instruct the competent authorities to instruct various railway bureaus and merchants to purchase wood, grain, and other local products operated by our overseas Chinese from Nanyang in order to save the fate of overseas Chinese merchants. If the government cares about overseas Chinese affairs, it will definitely adopt these relief measures. The results will be reported later. This matter concerns the interests of all overseas Chinese compatriots. If you agree, please reply immediately and send representatives to Shanghai to jointly prepare for the establishment of an organization. In particular, we hope that you will directly send a telegram to the Central National Government expressing your consistent position on the issue of requesting the provincial government's power in order to achieve the ultimate goal. We look forward to it. Sincerely, Mr. So-and-so, etc."</p>

<p>Thirty-three Years Since Last Appearance</p>
<p>Leo Meteor Shower</p>
<p>Announced by the Astronomical Observatory Research Institute</p>
<p>Around the 16th of this month</p>
<p>Meteors will fall like rain, resembling fireworks.</p>
<p>A "meteor shower" is a group of meteors appearing in space, radiating from a certain point in the sky and scattering in all directions. The activity of meteor showers has a predictable cycle. When they reach their peak, they fall densely like rain, what the ancients called "stars falling like rain," resembling the spectacle of fireworks and being extremely beautiful. There are countless meteor showers, but the Leo meteor shower is the most famous. It can be seen every year in mid-November, and its peak period cycles approximately every thirty-three years. Years such as 1833, 1866, and 1899 were all active periods. This year is 1932, thirty-three years since 1899. According to previous patterns, it is again approaching its peak. The period for the Leo meteor shower this year will be around November 13th or 14th at the earliest, and no later than the 18th or 19th. It is expected to be at its most intense on the 15th, 16th, and 17th. The location of Leo in the celestial sphere is approximately at right ascension 10 hours and declination north 23 degrees (this position, using old Chinese star names, is "Xuanyuan"). In mid-November, it appears in the east around 1 AM. By dawn, this constellation will have moved to the south. Therefore, observers should look east around 1 or 2 AM each night around the 16th, and shift their gaze to the southeast around 3 or 4 AM, ceasing observation around 4 or 5 AM to witness this spectacle.</p>
<p>For information on various aspects of the Leo meteor shower, please refer to the Chinese Astronomical Society's "Cosmos Monthly," Volume 2, Number 10. "Cosmos Monthly" is available for sale at the Zhengzhong Bookstore on Taiping Road in Nanjing and the Astronomical Exhibition Hall on Paozihe in Dongcheng, Beiping.</p>
<p>They arrived to greet him, and after the ship docked at the Kowloon Wharf, representatives from over eighty organizations boarded. After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr. Weng rested briefly on the seventh floor of the Gloucester Hotel before attending various banquets. His entourage included Luo Yinpu, Lin Junneng, and Chen Ding. Their journey would first take them to the Philippines, then the South Sea Islands, and finally to Europe and America.</p>

<p>No satisfactory outcome yet</p>
<p>Residents of Wangjiajing, Zhao Jiahuahui, Zhuxiang, and other villages in Pengpu District, where the Ministry of Railways is constructing a joint railway and road transport terminal, have repeatedly requested that their villages be avoided, but without result. On the evening of the 8th, they sent representatives Hou Xuanqing, Zhao Youting, Zhao Wenxiu, Zhang Zhongxiang, Zhao Zuyan, Tao Wenyuan, and six others to Beijing to petition. Yesterday, these representatives returned to Shanghai. They reported that on the morning of the 9th, they petitioned the Executive Yuan and were received by Councilor Chen, who promised to order the Ministry of Railways to investigate and re-examine the matter. In the afternoon, they petitioned the Ministry of Railways and were received by Vice Minister Zeng, who sent Director Sun Mou and Section Chief Yang Zhizhang of the Engineering Department to meet them. The representatives made three demands: 1) The Ministry of Railways should avoid the villages north of Jiaotong Road; 2) The Ministry of Railways should clearly announce how much land would be needed for the construction of the terminal; 3) Compensation should be provided for the land and villages that are being expropriated. Mr. Sun and Mr. Yang promised to forward the requests to Vice Minister Zeng for prompt consideration. On the afternoon of the 10th, they petitioned the Central Party Headquarters and were received by Ye Baozhi from the Secretariat, who promised to order the Executive Yuan to review the matter and provide feedback after the Executive Yuan reports. The representatives, feeling that a satisfactory outcome would be difficult to achieve in the short term, returned to Shanghai yesterday to report the details of the petition to the villagers and to decide on further actions.</p>

<p>The Shanghai News Reporters Association, based on reports from its members that they were insulted by Chen Xinghan, the director of the Jinghu and Huhang railways, while covering the arrival of Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei's special train in Shanghai on August 5, requested the Association to intervene. The Association's Executive Committee resolved on August 15 to send a letter to Chen Xinghan requesting a clear written reply and a guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. On August 22, the Association received Chen Xinghan's reply, which lacked sincerity and was full of evasive language. The Association then submitted a request to the Ministry of Railways on September 29 to send personnel to investigate thoroughly, but no reply has been received to date. The Association convened a full meeting of the Executive Committee yesterday (the 11th) to seriously discuss the case.

<p>Public Security Bureau Sends Two Officers as Escort</p>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, Cai Jun, a 21-year-old communist from Guangdong, was engaged in clandestine activities last year, combining Communist parties in various districts of Guangdong and traveling to different regions to propagate communism. After being detected by the authorities, an arrest warrant was issued. Cai, realizing the failure, fled to Hong Kong for refuge. He was arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned for one year by the Hong Kong government. Upon completing his sentence, he was expelled from the concession. The Guangdong Provincial Public Security Bureau discovered the arrest warrant and dispatched Chen Xingfan to track Cai Jun, who boarded the Empress of Asia on the 6th of this month, and came to Shanghai. Prior to this, the bureau telegraphed the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to request assistance with the arrest. After reading the telegram, Director Wen ordered Inspector Cai and officers from the Water Patrol to rush to the ship at Wusongkou. Upon entering port, the ship was inspected, and Cai Jun was immediately arrested and taken to the bureau. After an interrogation by the Third Section, the Guangdong Public Security Bureau was notified of the arrest. Yesterday (the 11th) around 10 AM, Director Wen approved the handover of Cai to officers from the Guangdong bureau, who escorted him to the Qingyuan Steamer of the Dong Tai Koo Company at Xin Kaihe and returned him for trial. It is reported that Director Wen ordered the Criminal Investigation Team to send squad leader Hu Kuisheng and Detective Rong Bingchen, along with three others, to escort him on board to prevent any unforeseen circumstances.</p>

<p>Opposes Liu Zhennian's Troops Being Transferred to Hubei</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hubei Public Association telegraphed the Central Government to oppose the transfer of Liu Zhennian's troops to central Hubei: "Your Excellency (a respectful form of address), Hubei has suffered from natural disasters and man-made calamities for a long time. Famine has struck repeatedly, bandits and communists are rampant, and displacement and chaos prevail, leaving most homes empty. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang, mindful of the suffering of the disaster victims, is determined to suppress the communists. The fighting has brought peace and stability. From the five illustrations in the 'Pictorial Record of Communist Suppression' published in the Hankou Zhen Dan Bao, it is clear that the Xu, He, and Kong factions have been wiped out. Only small, scattered remnants remain, occupying less than one county and possessing fewer than one thousand guns. This proves that the efforts to suppress the communists in Hubei have been successful. The military phase has passed, and what is needed now is political relief for the displaced and stability for the people. Since the suppression of the communists began, large armies have gathered, and the main force of the communists has been crushed without any remnants. Using them to search for the remaining bandits would be more than sufficient. There is no need to transfer troops from other provinces to Hubei to assist in the suppression. Liu Zhennian's troops are stationed in Jiaodong, where they levy taxes indiscriminately, oppress the people to the bone, and have no military discipline. Chairman Han punished them first, and then the people of Jiaodong enumerated their crimes. Their oppressive policies and domineering actions are well-known to the people of the country. Recently, news reports stated that the Central Government mediated the Shandong affair and decided to transfer Liu Zhennian's troops to central Hubei to suppress the communists, which is alarming. Hubei has recovered its lost territory, the displaced have returned, and the priority is political stability. To place troops who are accustomed to cruelty and oppression over people who have just recovered from pain is tantamount to poisoning a sick person, depriving the people of Hubei of any hope of recovery. This association, concerned about its homeland, cannot stand by and watch. With a heart of saving our hometown, we make an earnest appeal to ensure that Liu Zhennian's troops are transferred to areas where the work of suppressing the communists is intense, so that they can redeem themselves through meritorious service, which would benefit the country and the people, not only directly benefiting Hubei but also indirectly benefiting the country. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Hubei Public Association."</p>

<p>The office of the Japanese Commercial Counselor in Shanghai received a telegram from Japan yesterday stating that Japan's total exports in October were worth 147,000,000 Japanese yen. Exports such as raw silk, cotton cloth, and miscellaneous goods increased, resulting in a trade surplus of 49,000,000 Japanese yen. However, the total foreign trade for the ten months since January is still a trade deficit of 66,000,000 Japanese yen, an increase of 11,000,000 Japanese yen compared to the same period last year. The current export trade situation is quite good and is expected to improve the balance. Exports to China in September were worth 13,000,000 Japanese yen, resulting in a trade surplus of 6,000,000 Japanese yen (which, in our country's terms, is a trade deficit). Compared to the export value of the same period last year, exports to North China increased by 58 percent, while exports to Central China decreased by 37 percent, and exports to South China decreased by 63 percent. As for Chinese goods imported into Japan, imports from North China increased by 5.7 percent, imports from Central China increased by 1.7 percent, and imports from South China decreased by 12.8 percent. Exports from Japan to the three northeastern provinces in September were worth 14,000,000 Japanese yen, resulting in a trade surplus of 9,500,000 Japanese yen. Compared to the same period last year, exports increased by 100 percent and imports decreased by 37 percent.</p>

<p>Return to Shanghai for Extortion</p>
<p>Former Tahe Comprador Shen Chengfu is Extorted</p>
<p>The Bandits Agreed to Use Cigarette Tins as Signals</p>
<p>The Police Sent Detectives to Lie in Wait and Arrested Six People</p>
<p>They Were Interrogated Yesterday and Sent to Yuyao for Trial</p>
<p>Shen Chengfu, a Yuyao native who formerly served as the comprador of the British Tahe Foreign Firm, lost his comprador position last year after losing a large sum of money in speculative business ventures. The Zhihe Qianzhuang managed by his father, Shen Yingxiang, was also dragged down by the issuance of bad checks and went bankrupt. A few months ago, while Shen Yingxiang, who was also unemployed, had returned to his ancestral home in Wucheyan, Yuyao, he and his family were attentively watching a theatrical performance held to honor the gods. Suddenly, several thugs silently approached and opened fire on him with pistols. Shen Yingxiang's second son, Shanfu, rushed forward upon hearing the alarm, protecting his father with his sister, but was fatally shot on the spot. Yingxiang and his daughter were both wounded by gunfire, and the assailants escaped. It was later learned that the thugs were notorious kidnappers who believed Yingxiang had made a fortune in Shanghai and returned home with a large sum of money, so they attempted to kidnap him for ransom. However, the local authorities were conducting a strict manhunt, so the bandits fled to Shanghai, still obsessed with the Shen family. Recently, they learned of Shen Chengfu's address and sent him a threatening letter demanding 50,000 yuan. They initially arranged to negotiate at a hotel on Avenue Edward VII, but later changed the meeting place to in front of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Tibet Road at 1:30 PM on November 3. Those attending would carry three cigarette tins as a signal. Shen immediately reported this information to the Old Gate Police Station. Detectives Zhou Guisen and Zhang Yi were dispatched to the meeting place to observe the situation. Soon after, Xing Weicheng from Shaoxing arrived and was arrested. Under interrogation, they proceeded to house number 357 on Rue Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, where they arrested five other people: Wang Jianfa, Sun Yiqian, Song Yixin, Wang Jixiang, and a woman named Wang Qiu. They were handed over to the First Special District Court. They confessed that there were other accomplices at large, and they were ordered to be detained pending the arrest of the remaining bandits. A week has passed, and no other fugitives have been apprehended. The Yuyao County Government, after investigation, discovered that the Xing group were the wanted criminals who had shot and killed Shen Shanfu and his father. They prepared an official letter and sent police to Shanghai to request their extradition. This morning, they petitioned the court to transfer the suspects. Judge Qian ordered the suspects to be brought before the court for interrogation. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the police investigation revealed that the arrested suspects had only committed extortion against Shen Chengfu and had not committed any other crimes. Therefore, the police had no objection to the Yuyao authorities' request for extradition. Judge Qian then ordered that the six men and women, including Xing Weicheng, be handed over to the police from the Yuyao County Government for return and trial.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Two Kidnappers Executed by Firing Squad <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Xia Adi Said Goodbye to His Family</p>
<p>Tears Flowed, a Sad Sight</p>
<p>Dong Shuying was kidnapped by bandits on Avenue Joffre on May 27 of this year. The General Investigation Section of the General Police Department arrested several kidnappers, including Shanghai native Xia Adi (29 years old) and Zheng Gengsheng (24 years old), and handed them over to the First Special District Court. After clear confession and judgement, the two criminals Xia and Zheng were sentenced to death and reported to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval and execution. Yesterday afternoon, the time for execution arrived. The police escorted the two criminals to the case hearing. The execution magistrate Shen Shanzeng, presided over the Third Criminal Court. He explained to the two criminals that they had been ordered to be executed by firing squad today and asked if they had any last words. Xia Adi stated that his parents and wife were in court today and requested permission to have a final conversation to express his farewell. The court granted permission. Xia then said to his wife and parents, "I will be executed today. You must go to the execution ground to collect my body. I was foolishly deceived by others in this matter, and I regret it, but it is too late. Please, parents, take care of my wife and handle all unfinished matters." As he spoke, tears flowed down his face, and the scene was very sad. Zheng Gengsheng then stated that he had a suit of Western clothing and eighteen pawn tickets at the police station, and he requested that a letter be sent to his wife, Zheng Hemei, at number 1412 next to the Dahua Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, asking her to come and collect them. He had nothing else to say. After reviewing the confession, Magistrate Shen ordered them to be sent to the Prosecutor's Office of the District Court for execution. Chinese and Western police officers escorted the two criminals down, together with the photo file, and loaded them into a car that drove directly to the Pujiangjing execution ground. At the same time, the District Court was notified to send a prosecutor to supervise the execution along with the bailiff. After questioning the two criminals one last time, they were ordered to be executed by firing squad.</p>

<p>Representatives Depart for Beiping and Tianjin</p>
<p>It was heard yesterday that the Anhui Fellow Villagers and Anhui Academic Association in Shanghai are opposing the rice surtax. Although the National Government has expressed its intention to abolish it, Wu Zhongxin, Ye Yuanlong, and Jiang Wei have not immediately canceled it. Yesterday, they sent representatives Xia Junhuan to depart for Beiping, Tianjin, and other places to appeal to and connect with fellow villagers, jointly opposing the tax until the goal of abolishing it is achieved. The representatives were heard to have boarded a train north from the station at 7:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Northeast Refugee Association to Ship Cotton Clothes <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees yesterday received a telegram from its representatives in Beiping, Qu Yingguang and Feng Xuefen, which stated, "The relief funds received include 50,000 yuan, which were first transferred to the Bank of China, Changchun branch. Only 6,000 pieces of cotton clothing have been transported to Beiping. Are these suits or just upper garments? This amount is very disappointing. There are many disaster victims from the Northeast arriving in Beiping. It would be best to find ways to increase aid. Feng is expected to leave the customs on the (14th). Changchun has approved an additional 30,000 sets of clothing, which requires an additional 50,000 yuan. Please also remit the Harbin relief funds successively, as postal correspondence is slow and delayed, and we are deeply concerned about delays. The Beiping porridge kitchens are scheduled to open simultaneously on the (16th). We will wait for proper arrangements here, then return to Shanghai via Qingdao." After receiving the telegram, the association plans to pack and ship the more than 7,000 pieces of cotton clothing currently in stock, of which half are cotton pants and 10% are children's clothes, dividing and sending 50% to each of Changchun and Harbin.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees has actively solicited donations for relief efforts. The amount of relief funds remitted daily is considerable. Yesterday, the association received an advance of 3,000 yuan from Jisheng Hospital and 2,400 yuan from Lianyi Shanhui, which were remitted to Beiping yesterday morning to provide relief.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Flour Exchange yesterday sent a letter to Renji Tang on Six Malu, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees, and the Provisional Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, stating that the Shanghai Flour Exchange will donate 1.5% of its business revenue to disaster relief, for a period of six months. Approximately 1,000 taels of silver will be donated each month. 1,000 silver dollars will be sent this month for the relief of Northeast refugees, but the assistance will be divided such that four months will be spent on relieving the Northeast, and two months on helping the disaster areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. It is reported that the association has already received the 1,000 taels for Northeast relief in advance.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Establishment of the Shanghai Russian Emigrant Association <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Kotenev is Appointed Chairman</p>
<p>Although There is No Extraterritoriality, Foreigners Also Receive Equal Treatment</p>
<p>Last Sunday (i.e., the 6th of this month), the Shanghai Russian Emigrant Public United Association was formally established at its headquarters at No. 39 Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai. The establishment of the association was submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters for registration, and the Municipal Party Headquarters approved its establishment in its approvals of August 4 and October 8 of this year. On the day of the association's inaugural meeting, 39 representatives from 33 Russian emigrant associations, plus one representative from the "Shanghai General Russian Association," attended. The members of the aforementioned Russian emigrant associations total 3,000, and averaging three relatives per Russian emigrant, the total number of people should be 9,000. From this, it can be seen that the newly established Shanghai Russian Emigrant Public United Association is an organization that represents the majority of Russian emigrants, as the household survey statistics show that there are a total of 15,000 Russian emigrants in Shanghai. The leader of the United Association is A.M. Kotenev, a famous jurist who has served in the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Council for many years and has considerable affection for our country. Therefore, his leadership of the United Association will be based on compliance with our country's laws as a prerequisite. The efforts of Mr. Guo have contributed to the ability of Shanghai's Russian emigrants to abide by our laws and recognize our country's authority in public life. However, recently, a small group of Russian emigrant organizations, led by CH. Metzler (Mr. Metzler was the secretary of the former Russian Imperial Consulate in Shanghai), under the name "Shanghai Russian Emigrant Relief Society," located at No. 6 Hong Kong Road, is still attacking and calling the United Association pro-foreign and treasonous. On the day of the United Association's official inaugural meeting, the Relief Society's Russian-language newspaper Slovo published a vitriolic editorial attacking Mr. Guo as a communist and warning Russian emigrants not to join the United Association, implying that the association was under the control of the Kuomintang, and that the most likely outcome was that all Russian emigrants in the association would become communists. Various unsightly slogans and cartoons were published in the newspaper, representing the Kuomintang as Mongolian barbarians, and Mr. Guo as unable to supply plans. Before and on the day of the association's official establishment, it was subjected to various abuses, and even anonymous letters were sent to the leaders of other foreign organizations in an attempt to destroy it. However, the United Association's official inaugural meeting was successfully held. The following are the elected executive committee members of the United Association: Chairman Kotenev, Vice Chairman Sentelikov, Doctor Fumin, Secretary He Leci, and Doctor Accountant Bokemian. All of these individuals are foreigners who are friendly to our country and abide by the law. The preferential treatment given to Shanghai's Russian emigrants by the Chinese Kuomintang proves that foreigners, although without extraterritorial rights, also receive equal treatment under the law. This further refutes the fallacy in the Lytton Report that White Russian emigrants in the three northeastern provinces receive poor treatment from China.</p>

<p>Permission Granted for J.D. Fage Bookstore to Print</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently completed the revision of the map of Shanghai and its surrounding areas. Compared to the old map, the scope of the northern district has been greatly expanded, and the eastern boundary has also been slightly lengthened. The Director of the Public Works Department believes that it would be very expensive to print the map abroad. If J.D. Fage Bookstore in Shanghai were to undertake the printing, the printing costs could be saved, and the work would be satisfactory. This matter has been approved by the Public Works Committee and the Board of Directors. The printing cost is estimated at 4,050 yuan. After publication, a certain amount of revenue can be obtained from sales to offset the costs.</p>

<p>Recently, several people have written letters to the Western newspapers, advocating for the construction of a pond in Hongkew Park for model boats to sail in. According to the Public Works Committee's consideration, it is not appropriate to convert the existing pond for this purpose. The Acting Director of the Public Works Department reported that the depth of the existing pond is not suitable, and the small bushes along the pond are needed for wind protection and are important for the scenery of the entire park, so they cannot be removed. The pond should not be remodeled according to the wishes of a few people. After deliberation, the committee recommended that the pond remain as it is, but an item can be included in next year's budget to prepare for the construction of a model boat pond. However, it is questionable whether there will be sufficient financial resources next year. This suggestion has been adopted by the Board of Directors.</p>

<p>Regarding the Opposition to Telephone Rate Increases</p>
<p>The increase in telephone rates in the concession has sparked public outcry. Disputes have continued to this day, with no concrete solution. The Western Clothing Industry Association recently sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, urging them to persevere to the end. The Taxpayers' Association yesterday sent a letter in reply, detailing the progress of negotiations. The full text of the correspondence is as follows: (1) Esteemed Sirs, the matter of the Shanghai telephone rate increase has been widely publicized since July of this year, causing a great uproar. A small number of subscribers have carelessly resigned themselves to it without considering the consequences, and have been unknowingly pressured into compliance. Subsequently, public organizations such as the First District Branch of the Shanghai Citizens' Association and the Nanjing Road Business Association have repeatedly argued against the rate increase, citing reasons and issuing public statements of protest, which we believe your association has already noted. In view of the economic conditions of this city, our association finds it difficult to bear such a burden. We have long admired your association's upholding of justice. We have read with respect your association's letter to the Public Works Department, which was stern, righteous, and hit the mark, deeply resonating with the public sentiment. We sincerely hope that your association will persevere to the end, show sympathy and support, and vow to achieve the termination of the original telephone rate increase proposal. This would be a great boon to merchants and residents alike. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association. (2) Esteemed Sirs, we acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 5 regarding the telephone rate increase, which is incompatible with the social economy, and your request that we persevere in opposing it to the end. Upon receiving news of the telephone rate increase, our association immediately wrote to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, explaining that under the circumstances of the social economy, the rate increase was unacceptable, and requesting that it be temporarily postponed. Unexpectedly, not only was this not approved, but the Public Works Department even went so far as to violate the universally recognized legal principle against retroactive application, adding charges retroactively from March 27 onwards. This led to widespread opposition. In accordance with public opinion, our association actively explained to the Public Works Department the reasons for opposing the rate increase and demanding its immediate cancellation. When the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association and the Nanjing Road Business Association issued a declaration, we immediately forwarded it to the Public Works Department, urging them to submit it to the Board of Directors for reconsideration along with our case. In response to the above, we respectfully reply to your association, hoping you will take note and offer your valuable guidance to correct any shortcomings. This is our sincere prayer. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Western Clothing Industry Association.</p>

<p>The Dongsheng, a North China-bound steamer of Jardine Matheson, was traveling to Tanggu last month when its compradore, Li Shanting, was kidnapped by bandits on board. Wharf manager Huang Wenqi and a Mr. Zhang who stepped forward to stop them were also abducted. After this incident occurred, the British Consul in Tianjin negotiated with the Tianjin authorities for their rescue. At the same time, the families of the hostages also sought rescue through various channels. Later, it was discovered that the hostages were being held in Xinzhuang, near Tianjin. The family of Huang Wenqi negotiated with the bandits repeatedly and eventually ransomed Huang Wenqi for 20,000 yuan. Subsequently, the military learned of this and dispatched troops to suppress the bandits, but the bandits had already moved the hostages, including Li Shanting, to another location. According to Huang Wenqi, Li Shanting had become deranged due to severe stress and his whereabouts are currently unknown. His family is extremely anxious.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Yang Xixian Purchases Cotton with Bad Checks <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Court Orders Arrest; Yang Surrenders</p>
<p>Yesterday's Trial Orders Release on 10,000 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>Yang Xixian, a local resident who lives at No. 42 Xin Chongqing Road, holds the position of manager at Longmao Textile Co., Ltd. Recently, the company suddenly went bankrupt due to financial difficulties. It then hired lawyer Li Zuyu and accountant Xu Yongzu to publish a notice to settle accounts. However, on September 28 of this year, Yang, in the name of the company, ordered 100 bales of cotton from the Mei'an Foreign Firm at No. 4 Edward Road, valued at 14,316 taels and 7 cents. Two checks were issued to the Zhongnan Bank for payment on a future date. When the foreign firm went to Zhongnan Bank to collect the money on the due date, it was discovered that Longmao Company had no funds, and the checks were returned. Subsequently, the Mei'an Foreign Firm negotiated with Longmao, but Yang avoided meeting them. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that the cotton had been mortgaged by Yang to Zhongnan Bank to obtain funds for his escape, which constituted intentional fraud. The foreign firm then reported the matter to the General Police Station, which forwarded it to the First Special District Court, which issued an arrest warrant. Until the day before yesterday, Yang realized that he could not escape the law and surrendered to the police. He was detained by the police chief and sent to the Summary Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. In addition to sending Deputy Manager Zhang Qiankui to court to respond to the lawsuit, the victim, Mei'an Foreign Firm, also hired lawyer Zhu Xiyun to appear in court to file a civil suit, requesting that the court order compensation for the losses. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the police were prosecuting the defendant under Article 363 of the Criminal Law for fraud and breach of trust, and described how Yang Xixian defrauded Mei'an Foreign Firm of goods by fraudulent means, alleging that the defendant specialized in purchasing goods from various foreign firms and businesses with bad checks and then mortgaging the goods to banks to obtain funds for hiding. He added that there were likely many such cases of fraud, and the police were currently investigating. It was also discovered that Longmao Company had mortgaged 250,000 taels to Zhongnan Bank. Therefore, he requested that the case be adjourned for a special hearing. The defendant, who had hired lawyer Zhang Zhengju to appear in court, agreed to the adjournment but requested that the arrest warrant be revoked and that the defendant be allowed to be released on bail. After consulting with Judge Liu Yugui, it was ruled that the case would be rescheduled for a further hearing next Friday afternoon, and Yang Xixian was allowed to be released on 10,000 taels bail, with the defense lawyer responsible for ensuring his attendance when summoned.</p>

<p>Jiao Daosong Transferred to Public Security Bureau First</p>
<p>The case of Jiao Daosong, advisor to the Military Affairs Committee, and Wang Aoxi, former chief writer for the New World News, who were arrested at the China Hotel by personnel from the Municipal Public Security Bureau in conjunction with the Lao Zha Police for suspected reactionary activities and detained for interrogation by the Second Branch of the High Court, has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the Second Branch of the High Court, with Judge Yu presiding, continued the trial in a collegial panel. The Municipal Public Security Bureau specially dispatched legal counsel Zhan Jifeng to court to request the transfer of Jiao Daosong. Subsequently, police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that during the extension period, the police had seized a number of documents at No. 7 Gongping Road, all of which were related to Wang Aoxi. These documents were still under investigation, so he requested another extension for review. Lawyer Zhan stated that the Public Security Bureau's request for an extension regarding Wang Aoxi could be agreed to, but since there were no new facts discovered regarding Jiao Daosong, he should be allowed to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation first, so as not to delay the process. After consultation with assessors Zhao and Lu, Judge Yu deemed this to be reasonable and immediately ruled that Jiao Daosong should be transferred to the Public Security Bureau for investigation, while Wang Aoxi would be returned to custody, and the trial would be continued on the morning of the 21st of this month.</p>

After the prosecutor concluded the investigation, Zhu Shouzhi was dismissed without prosecution, while Tian Zhihe and Yu Taiji were prosecuted for accepting bribes. After repeated questioning by the criminal court, Tian Zhihe and Yu Taiji were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment and fined 500 yuan. In addition, 150 yuan of the embezzled money should be recovered from Tian Zhihe and 350 yuan from Yu Taiji, and confiscated for public use.</p>

<p>Jiangwan Epidemic Hospital has been operating for nearly ten years. Last year, a local gentleman, Zhu Jiansheng, donated more than three mu of land to build a new building, which gradually stabilized the foundation. Unexpectedly, the January 28th Incident occurred, and the entire building was destroyed. With the enthusiastic donations of philanthropists Zhu Ziyun, Cai Xiangsun, Zhang Xinliang, Wang Hanli, Quan Yuanren, and others, as well as the Xu Bingji Construction Factory and the hospital's board of directors, a new building was rebuilt. The hospital mainly treats epidemic diseases during the summer and autumn, and during normal times, it is converted into an obstetrics department and also handles common diseases. However, the hospital is a charity that provides free treatment to the poor, and its finances are quite tight. Last night, a dinner was held at the Sichuan Road YMCA to entertain philanthropists, including Zhu Ziyun, Cai Xiangsun, and the heads of various departments of the hospital, Dr. Wang Enguang. Mr. Wang Hanli, the hospital's representative, hosted the event. During the dinner, Mr. Wang described the hospital's current situation and future plans. He stated that if the hospital could not continue to operate, the poor and sick would suffer greatly, and he hoped that all philanthropists would provide substantial assistance so that the hospital could continue to operate without interruption.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Law and Commerce Tutoring School, which Wu Kaisheng and others plan to establish, has already appointed Yu Youren, Wang Zhengting, Zhao Jinqing, and others as school directors. However, the scope of a tutoring school is too narrow and may not be of much benefit to young students. It is planned to convert it into a college. In addition to the existing preparations by Zhang Wuyuan and others, Luo Jue, a former business leader, has also been hired to actively prepare and strive for perfection. As for the opening date, due to the upcoming winter vacation and the limited amount of teaching time, it will be changed to open in the spring of next year.</p>

<p>Esteemed Sirs, in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on November 10th, there was a news item titled "Huishan Police Station Seizes Large Number of Kidnappers," which included a criminal named "Zhou Yuanlong from Qingjiang." This coincidentally matches my hometown and name. I live in Yangshupu and have been teaching for many years. I am sincerely concerned that inaccurate rumors will spread and damage my reputation. I am writing this letter to clarify the matter and request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Thank you. Respectfully, Zhou Yuanlong, 492 Huasheng Road, Yangshupu, November 11th.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Judge Fessenden's Research on the Shanghai International Settlement <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Report Volume IV (20)</p>
<p>12. The aforementioned regulations regarding pensions apparently conform to the statutory permanent service. If employees can maintain proper conduct, they can retain their positions, except in the event of certain types of incidents, until they have served for twenty years and reached the age of fifty. Furthermore, if such an incident occurs, they also have the right to claim compensation. However, in reality, the employees of the Public Works Department do not enjoy such legal rights. According to the three-year contract system, the Public Works Department can refuse to renew the contract of any employee at any time, regardless of how close they are to being eligible for a pension, and regardless of any hardship they may experience as a result of losing the opportunity to receive a pension. The employee has no legal basis to file a complaint. The situation is the same under the newly established contract format, because even if an employee is only slightly more than six months away from becoming eligible for a pension, the Public Works Department can still terminate the contract at any time with six months' notice. Employees who lose their opportunity to receive a pension due to such notice, and not due to their own fault, have no legal basis to file a complaint.</p>
<p>13. In fact, it has been the policy of the Public Works Department to treat its employees fairly. The department has never used its legal powers in an unreasonable manner to deprive its employees of their pensions when they are close to being eligible for them. However, given the conditions attached to Clause 24 of the already cited Land Regulations, it seems that when establishing the current pension system, the Public Works Department should have taken the natural step of enacting a provision that allows foreign employees to continue in their positions after a probationary period until they reach the age at which they can receive a pension. However, if it is necessary to dismiss an employee before they reach the age at which they can receive a pension for the sake of departmental affairs, the department retains the right to dismiss them. If the dismissal is not due to the employee's incompetence or poor performance, then compensation can be given according to reasonable standards, or including a portion of the pension calculated proportionally to the years of service.</p>
<p>14. Currently, a peculiar situation arises because the legal rights actually possessed by the Public Works Department's employees are inconsistent with the so-called moral or reasonable demands that have been customarily recognized by the Public Works Department. If the department does not recognize these demands, it is inconsistent with the entire principle of adopting a pension system.</p>
<p>D. The Need for Security of Tenure</p>
<p>15. In the previous chapter of this report (Note 5), it was solemnly stated that one of the main elements for the Public Works Department to establish an honest and effective administration is to provide its employees with generous remuneration and security of tenure.</p>
<p>16. Regarding this, security of tenure is extremely important. Although many employees have served in the Public Works Department for a long time and have therefore received pensions, a system that is originally intended to establish permanent service but does not provide any guarantee of permanence to the relevant employees, and that allows questions regarding security of tenure and pension rights to be handled entirely at the discretion of the authorities without being based on accepted and approved conditions, cannot be considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>17. Although the issue of security of tenure arises primarily from the current status of foreign employees, since only foreign employees are covered by the current pension system, it may soon be deemed appropriate to make necessary modifications to the measures established for the benefit of foreign employees and extend them to senior Chinese staff, as the Public Works Department is increasingly adopting a policy of increasing the number of senior Chinese staff.</p>
<p>18. In this way, the scope of the issues raised by the Foreign Employees' Association appears to be broader than the association's representatives can immediately perceive. This is not only a matter of protecting the interests of foreign employees from any fundamental reform of the Public Works Department's existing organizational law or of issues that directly affect them, but also a matter of how the measures adopted to allow service in the Public Works Department to have a permanent basis should be thoroughly implemented to achieve logical results, thereby helping to establish a sound civil service system. The most valuable legacy that the current International Settlement authorities can hope to pass on to their ultimate successors may be such a system.</p>
<p>E. The Value of a Civil Service System</p>
<p>19. To understand the value of such a legacy in maintaining a high level of financial integrity and establishing sufficient safeguards against bribery and corruption, one only needs to recall the opinions of Mr. Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, who stated that "the only true and lasting remedy for eradicating the bad habits and real malpractices of government officials that have existed for centuries" is to establish an effective civil service system. But what is the value of this system to an organization such as the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, or any other organization composed of elected officials that may eventually inherit the responsibilities of the Public Works Department (Note 7)? There are other perspectives that I would like to discuss.</p>
<p>20. Any employer who wants good service from its personnel must establish conditions that enable it to attract suitable people to serve, and must have sufficient guarantees that these conditions will be strictly observed. However, a public organization that has been granted broad governing powers and is composed of people elected through regular public elections is in a very special position. This position makes its ability as an employer fundamentally different from that of individual employers who run their familiar industrial and commercial businesses with individual capabilities, to the point that it cannot be controlled by the power of one person. Compared to other employers, public organizations are generally more completely dependent on the character and abilities of their personnel. These other employers include large industrial and commercial companies whose service organizations are modeled after the civil service system to some extent. The reason why public organizations are so heavily dependent on their personnel is partly due to the nature, scope, and complexity of the work they undertake, but largely due to the method of electing the personnel of these organizations and the fact that their terms of office are generally shorter. Any public organization composed of elected officials must have frequent changes in its members, and people with no experience in handling public affairs may be elected at any time. Such organizations cannot expect to maintain a high level of administration and established customs except by utilizing their officials and employees, who are qualified to preserve this level and these customs. Therefore, whether it is to adapt to changing circumstances or to implement the opinions of the electors and their representatives, it can still guarantee the consistency and continuity of administration when policies need to be changed.</p>
<p>21. In order for the officials of public organizations organized through elections to effectively carry out the important duties they should perform according to the situation, they must enjoy reasonable security of tenure. This security not only gives them the opportunity to gain the necessary experience, but also gives them a certain degree of independence. Government and municipal officials inevitably encounter conflicts with public sentiment or powerful private interests in the performance of their administrative or advisory duties. However, the public interest requires that officials, for the benefit of society as a whole, freely exercise their independent judgment without any reason to fear that they may lose their jobs or that their terms of service will be changed to their detriment as a form of punishment.</p>
<p>22. Any public organization established through elections, such as the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, relies heavily on a large number of capable officials and employees to fulfill its various tasks as a governing body. The terms of their employment should be such that their positions are adequately secured and that they are encouraged to dedicate most of their most productive years to serving the Public Works Department. Therefore, the proper establishment and strict adherence to regulations regarding the security of tenure, remuneration, and training of service personnel is fundamentally important.</p>
<p>23. Therefore, the protection needed by the officials and employees of the Public Works Department, whether it is a special contingency measure created by a fundamental reform of the department's organizational law or part of a permanent system, is not only a protection for the interests of a class of directly related employees, but also a necessary protection for the interests of the Public Works Department as an employer and the society it represents. Both aspects of this issue should be remembered at all times.</p>
<p>24. If any fundamental reform is implemented in the organizational law of the governing body of the International Settlement, regardless of whether the actual result of this reform is consistent with the meaning of the term "recovery" that I have used (Note 8), a provision must be established for the sake of good governance and the interests of both Chinese and foreign employees directly involved. On the one hand, it should guarantee that employees who are dismissed or who wish to resign due to changes in their terms of service can receive fair treatment. On the other hand, it should also allow a large number of personnel with experience under the old system to continue to serve. If the new organization can have these people as advisors and assistants, the risk of disruption or any serious interruption of affairs can be greatly reduced, and the valuable characteristics of the old governance, which have been proven and whose beneficial results have been generally praised, can have a better chance of being maintained under the new circumstances.</p>
<p>F. Three Ways to Solve the Problem</p>
<p>25. I believe that there are three possible ways to achieve all or part of all objectives, that is, to provide more effective security for the terms of service of certain officials and employees of certain parts of the Public Works Department, and thus to make the basis of their service comparable to the basis of a permanent civil service system. The three ways are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Amendment of the Land Regulations</p>
<p>(2) Resolution of the Ratepayers' Meeting</p>
<p>(3) Modification of the Pension Regulations</p>
<p>I now request that these three methods be briefly described in order. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e229">Tung Oil <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Yanneng</p>
<p>Tung oil is produced in large quantities in our country, but we do not know how to refine and utilize it ourselves, which is a great pity. Fellow countrymen, may you not dismiss this important issue with just the word "pity." We should earnestly study and practically improve it. This is the way to revitalize industry!</p>
<p>On October 26th, this publication published an article by Mr. Nai Zheng titled "Tung Oil Worth Noting," which is very valuable and worth paying attention to. Mr. Nai Zheng spoke in detail about the origin and source of tung oil, but did not mention the aspects of manufacturing (different from method) and inspection, and I also feel that there is a need to supplement the uses of tung oil.</p>
<p>Tung oil is a very important coating, very suitable for the decoration of houses. When applied to wood or ironware, it can prevent the decay of wood and the rusting of ironware. It can also be used as a raw material for white porcelain glaze, floor oil, water-resistant oil, brushing oil, protective film oil, wall painting oil, and various other daily necessities. Now, its properties, manufacturing, uses, and inspection are introduced as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Properties: The film formed by raw tung oil lacks elasticity and does not form a uniform film. Therefore, refined cooked tung oil must be used to be applicable. The characteristic of tung oil is that it can solidify above 500 degrees Fahrenheit and is insoluble in thinners. However, if it is mixed with other oils, its solidification point is often lowered.</p>
<p>(2) Manufacturing: There are many manufacturing methods for tung oil. The following are the manufacturing methods of China, the United States, and Germany:</p>
<p>A. Chinese manufacturing method: Add two qian of litharge and massicot to ten jin of raw tung oil, boil it in a pot, and stir it constantly with a wooden stick. When it boils four or five times, it can be poured into a earthenware bowl and stirred constantly until it cools. (The heat should be moderate, not too strong or too slow, to prevent the tung oil from being too old or too young. The added litharge and massicot are used to make it easy to dry and brighten, and have no other effect.)</p>
<p>B. American manufacturing method: Take ten gallons of raw tung oil, place it in a pot, and heat it slowly to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Add ten pounds of lead manganese soap. After it is completely dissolved, add five gallons of pure linseed oil and stir constantly. When the temperature reaches 400 degrees Fahrenheit, maintain it for half an hour, then remove from heat and add two to three gallons of thinner.</p>
<p>C. German manufacturing method: Heat the oil to 216 degrees Celsius and maintain it for one hour, stirring constantly without stopping. After removing from heat, thin it with turpentine.</p>
<p>(3) Uses: Tung oil has a wide range of uses, which are described below:</p>
<p>A. Porcelain glaze: Grind tung oil, rosin, artificial lacquer, and transparent porcelain together to obtain white porcelain glaze, which is suitable for the decoration of houses. If the oil is heavy and the resin is light, it can be used to coat woodware.</p>
<p>B. Protective film oil: Mixed oil made with a small amount of tung oil and a large amount of stearin is called protective film oil. When applied to three-in-one soil, it can fill in the small cracks. At the same time, the tung oil in it oxidizes to form a solid protective film to protect the three-in-one soil, so that it does not have flying debris after being trampled.</p>
<p>C. Water-resistant oil: Tung oil and gelatin can be used to make water-resistant oil. When applied to underwater machinery and pipe joints, it can isolate the contact with water.</p>
<p>D. Wall painting oil: Made from tung oil and rosin, it can be washed with water or rain when applied to walls.</p>
<p>E. Floor oil: Add a little stearin to tung oil to make floor oil. When applied to the floor, it can be washed without peeling off and leaves no traces when trampled. It is most suitable for trains and ships.</p>
<p>F. Brushing oil: Also known as baking oil. Used to brush automobile hoods and heaters, it can make them last longer. It is made by boiling tung oil, soybean oil, and a small amount of stearin together to 520 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>(4) Inspection: To inspect the quality of tung oil, 100 grams of the sample can be placed in a gold pot and heated to 540 degrees Fahrenheit. Pure oil will solidify into a light-colored solid. When cut with a knife, it is not sticky. If the color of the oil is darker and sticky, it is a sign of adulteration.</p>
<p>Society for the Improvement of Social Customs</p>
<h3 id="e230">Points for Improvement Regarding Banquets <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Yunzong</p>
<p>When people encounter events such as marrying a wife, marrying a daughter, sending off friends, or welcoming guests, they always hold banquets for relatives and friends to enjoy themselves. This is enough to connect feelings, and is not to be criticized. However, ordinary banquets nowadays have several shortcomings that must be urgently reformed, which are described in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) The invitation does not specify the time to be seated: Some invitations only state "noon" or "dusk" to be seated, and do not specify the time. However, each time period contains two hours. As a result, guests arrive at different times, and those who arrive early have to wait for those who arrive late, inevitably wasting time!</p>
<p>(2) Giving way: After the host is seated, guests should be seated in order. However, we often see humble people avoiding seats and not sitting down. From this, you push and I respect, making noise and commotion, which is really unnecessary!</p>
<p>(3) Urging people to drink: Alcohol is a stimulating substance, and it is best not to drink it. However, at ordinary banquets, the host often forces people to drink, showing enthusiasm, and harming people in the name of loving them, which I find very puzzling!</p>
<p>(4) Guessing fingers: When the alcohol is high, the host often guesses fingers to enjoy themselves. The phrases "Three Stars," "Four Joys," "First Rank," and "Five Kui" are not only vulgar and unbearable, but also the shouting and noise interfere with public morality. Moreover, it often leads to excessive drinking and loss of life, so what is the joy in doing this!</p>
<p>(5) Too many dishes: Recently, luxury has become fashionable. Whenever there is a banquet, rare delicacies are gathered and precious flavors are displayed. Eaters have limited stomachs and cannot taste all the delicacies, wasting the host's money in vain. Isn't this a miscalculation? Moreover, "the wine of a rich family is enough for a poor man's food for half a year!" and "behind vermilion gates meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie the bones of those who have frozen to death!" If we only indulge in personal appetites, can we not feel guilty in our hearts when we ask ourselves!</p>
<p>The above, will those who are wise think it is so?</p>
<p>School Scene</p>
<h3 id="e231">All Kinds of Things on the Blackboard <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Xiu</p>
<p>Before I rush to talk about it, we are a co-educational school, so before class every day, all kinds of words are written on the blackboard, mostly related to insulting female classmates. It seems that it is especially harsh for Miss × because she is relatively the most flirtatious.</p>
<p>One afternoon, before the first class, the blackboard read "××× (her name) Western painting, ×××, Ding Guagua, don't be smug, a pistol will deal with you,"</p>
<p>Before long, the class bell rang, and the female students all came in together. Seeing many male students laughing and shouting at the blackboard, the female student also gently raised her head, saw her own name written on the blackboard, and showed an unhappy expression on her face. She quickly turned around and reported to the Discipline Office. She happened to meet the Dean of Studies at the door (coming to give a lecture on the issue of seats). The female student then sued the Dean of Studies, and entered the classroom with the Dean of Studies. When the Dean of Studies saw it, he was also very unhappy, slowly wiped off these words, gave a big lecture, and questioned the male students, saying that male students were the same as ordinary things, nothing rare. Besides, you are the highest year in secondary school, and you should not have this kind of unconscious behavior. The students knew that they were wrong, so they sincerely accepted the teachings.</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Qian, a well-known Chinese teacher who studied the psychology of male and female students, gave a profound lecture (the first class was Chinese). All the students applauded. Mr. Qian said: Our human love of the opposite sex is something that cannot be suppressed, and it is something that everyone should have a heart of love, but so-called love must be pure love, true love, and this word of love must be stored in the heart, and cannot be expressed by writing on the blackboard. This is an insulting love, a rupture of love, and the result is the failure of the purpose of seeking love. We must know that love is pure, and when seeking love from a woman, those who love each other love each other, and those who do not love each other do not have to seek love from her again, but instead make her disgusted. At the same time, since we have obtained love, we must not only love her with my love, but also respect her. Respecting her is to abide by etiquette, and respecting and loving are equally important, which is pure love, noble love. On the contrary, it is the love of beasts, the love of barbarians. The ancients said, "Respect and love, then fear." I hope all students will remember this firmly.</p>
<p>In this way, time felt very fast, and the end-of-class bell rang. The female student certainly did not want to let the matter go, and asked the Discipline Office to investigate. This is not to say that the female student is ruthless, but it is a matter that should be investigated.</p>
<p>The second class started, and the school worker took a note from the Discipline Office and called the class monitor and deputy class monitor to ask questions. Later, he called a few more students, but in the end he could not find out. There was nothing that could be done, so he posted a notice saying "Anyone who scribbles on the blackboard again and insults the reputation of others will be severely punished once found out."</p>

<h3 id="e232">Wrongful Donation <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Hongshui</p>
<p>This is a scene from a live drama in a ×× lane near a factory. The street lamp reflects a dim and weak light, and at that time, as usual, there are some partners engaged in small business transactions | stinky tofu, wontons, sandalwood olives, evening newspapers, etc. are all available! The children who have finished work, invisibly regard this as a public playground, and occasionally they get into a fierce fight, rolling around in circles, thus making this lane even more chaotic and lively.</p>
<p>"Good Granny, Good Granny, a woman soliciting donations has come to our back door." A K ran panting from the back door into the hall, grabbing his good granny's clothes and reporting.</p>
<p>A plainly dressed young woman was already nodding respectfully in front of her kind eyes.</p>
<p>"Old lady, merit is boundless, do a good deed! There is someone called Gou who died at number three in the east-facing lane! He died at midnight yesterday | but | he is still lying in the quilt!" She seemed to explain the origin in extreme sincerity: "Alas, Madam, A Gou is lying down | nothing is settled. How could he have any savings when he was alive doing the Grand Quartermaster (cooking)? It is said that he has a son in the army who is not known where he has gone, and his wife has gone to Nanjing to help someone (amah), and there has been no news of her until now | For the sake of cohabitation, I am here to donate some money for him to be buried. It is still considered that A Gou was a good person, and many people are willing to donate!" She picked up a yellow donation book and said tremblingly: "Old lady is benevolent and generous, you will definitely show compassion, merit is boundless, great compassion and great mercy|"</p>
<p>"Okay, then write down one dollar." A K's good granny has always been a generous and charitable person, so of course this time would be no exception. As a result, Sister Zhang from the back door and Miss Deng from next door each donated half a dollar, two corners, one etc. Business was booming for a while, and there was an overwhelming demand | Finally, she thanked everyone and left in a hurry.</p>
<p>"Ah hey, Good Granny | I have lost a donation book here."</p>
<p>"Um um, quick, quick, help her send it back, Amitabha!"</p>
<p>When A K followed the door number of number three and looked for it, it was really unlucky | where were there any dead people called A Gou or A Cat? Only the sound of scolding was deeply imprinted in his mind: "Pig, farting nonsense, what dead person? I want you to perform a three-year Taiping Gong rite."</p>

<p>Editor's Remarks</p>
<h3 id="e233">Speaking Up for the Stars <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>Today, in the "Reader's Opinion" column, there is an article by Mr. Xi Zhan titled "Actors Must Go Among the People." I am publishing it not because his writing is particularly good or his opinions are insightful, but (no offense to Mr. Xi Zhan) because his thinking represents the impression of the general domestic film audience, or a large portion of it. He says, "Currently, most Chinese actors grow up in big cities, live in luxurious Western-style houses, wear gorgeous clothes, enjoy rich wine, and go everywhere in cars, all of which demonstrates a life under the glittering gold of capitalism." After reading this, I couldn't help but frown and smile. The smile and the frown both came because the same fantasy arose in my mind. It was as if I saw the gatherings of deities in Hollywood: reaching the magnificent mansions of Douglas Fairbanks and Mary Pickford, with many Rolls-Royces, Lincolns, Packards, Buicks, and silver-gray cars outside. Because the word "的" (de) after "cars" depicts the comings and goings of more than just one vehicle. Alas, what a wonderful rosy scene! Therefore, I closed my eyes and meditated on this, revealing a slight smile.</p>
<p>However, from the clouds, I tumbled down to the ground of the Suzhou Creek. What I actually see before my eyes in China is completely different from the fantasy of a few seconds ago. I recall that when the weather gets cold, actors with low incomes cannot afford new clothes and buy and wear used clothing on Wusong Road. They do sit in cars, but they are from the Yunfei Motor Company (unintentionally promoting Yunfei a bit). They are not luxurious, and four or five people ride in one, which is even more cost-effective than a rickshaw. Jin Yan is very popular, but he also has to wear second-hand clothes. Zhang Zhiyun rode in a car from the Lili Company (of course, promoting Yunfei, because she wouldn't agree not to promote Lili), and it even caused a bit of a stir. Chen Yumei advocates for simple clothing, perhaps because she cannot afford it, or at least because silk and satin are too expensive.</p>
<p>And then there is the hardship of the extras: freezing all night, starving for thirteen hours, and the reward for men is only one yuan, and for women, one yuan and twenty cents. This is also the life of an actor, but this kind of life is not even as good as pulling a rickshaw. But in the films, they have to pretend to be wealthy and grand. This leads to misunderstandings among the audience. This is what I want to speak up for on behalf of the stars, especially the poor ones.</p>
<p>In the end, with all industries in decline and livelihoods hanging by a thread, Western-style houses, cars, fancy clothes, and fine wine are what the stars pursue. But plums are sour and hang high on the tree. You can only look at them and swallow your saliva.</p>

<p>— Wang Zhihong</p>
<p>The Female Charlie Chaplin of Hollywood</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin is popular because his comedies are disguised tragedies; the most comical part is the scene that most evokes people's sympathy and deep thought. Eating a grand meal in The Gold Rush, the loss of a child in The Kid, and the ending of City Lights all prove the statement above.</p>
<p>Now, Hollywood people have found a female star who has the same style as Chaplin 丨丨Zasu Pitts丨丨 and they say that she is Chaplin's incarnation.</p>
<p>She was born in Kansas but grew up in Santa Cruz. In 1920, she married an actor, Tom Gallery. The first few years of their marriage were happy, but after seven years, they divorced! She was extremely unwilling to divorce, but the matter was beyond redemption, which left a huge scar on her heart.</p>
<p>She entered the film industry as early as 1917.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, she was ignored by Hollywood people for a long time. Later, she continued to play supporting roles in various films. With her dedicated research, her experience on the set, coupled with her inner refinement and the stimulation given by the environment, she created her current style and finally succeeded. Her performance can be seen in famous films like Monte Carlo; her comical interjections are also common in films starring Ann Harding and Constance Bennett.</p>
<p>Now, major directors feel that a film cannot have a good opening scene without her, so they often ask her to perform. With her performance, audiences smile with satisfaction as soon as they see her sorrowful face and her performance that transforms the sound of crying into something magical, comical but with a hint of sadness.</p>
<p>She is currently filming two full-length comedies, and after their release, the film industry will surely appreciate them.</p>

<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>To spite his ex-wife, Nedda Allwyn, Pesskay Den has specially acquired a new large automobile. The car is thirty-eight feet long and ten feet wide, with seating for twelve people and sleeping berths for seven. It also has a separate room as a club, complete with electric fans, electric lights, rocking chairs, playing cards, Pullman-style reclining chairs, a kitchen, and a rain shower. The entire car weighs twelve tons and is worth $52,000. "Once, he and Liu Koudi, wearing the uniforms of admirals of the army and navy and waist swords, drove this huge, odd car in a grand manner to the Biltmore Hotel in Santa Barbara, impersonating distinguished guests."</p>

<p>— Morning Star</p>
<p>Films produced by the German Ufa company have long enjoyed a considerable reputation in China. However, since last year, due to the suspicions of the Japanese manager, Ufa products have disappeared from the Chinese film market. Now, the German Ufa headquarters has signed a long-term contract with the British-owned Wan Guo Film Company in Shanghai. Ufa films will again be screened in China and the Far East to meet the needs of the audience. The first film to be shown in China is Congress Dances. This film depicts a romantic story during the Vienna Congress of heads of state after Napoleon's defeat. As to the results, we will have to wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e237">"A Tragic Love Affair" to Be Completed Soon <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Mei</p>
<p>The sound film "A Tragic Love Affair," recently produced by Tianyi Film Company, also known as "Shanghai Millionaire," is directed by Shao Zuiweng and stars Hu Shan and Ma Loufen. The plot tells the story of a millionaire's daughter who is kidnapped and then rescued, but in the end, she is still seduced by the powerful Ding. The plot is bizarre and twists and turns, and it makes a strong criticism of the squandering of inheritance. It is said that production is now more than halfway complete and will be finished soon.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Miss Carole Lombard's Mouth <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Min</p>
<p>Looking at her graceful posture and alluring attire, who would be willing to hit her, especially her rosy cheeks? But she was ultimately slapped as many as nineteen times. Hearing this, you may be surprised and ask, "Who hit her?" She was hit by an Irishman named Pat O'Brien.</p>
<p>If you haven't been to a film company, you may not understand that fighting with fists can be fake, but slapping cannot be fake. Especially in sound movies, the slapping has to be clear and audible. It is not surprising that male actors slap hard, but who dares to slap a female star's mouth? And to make it loud is even more difficult.</p>
<p>Carole Lombard was slapped nineteen times by her counterpart during rehearsals for the film "Virtue." The plot is bizarre, so we will have to wait for the film to come out to determine whether the slaps were justified. On the left is a portrait of Miss Lombard.</p>

<h3 id="e239">"Actors Must Go Among the People" <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Zhan</p>
<p>Looking at the recent articles in various newspapers about the direction that Chinese cinema should take in the future, most advocate that movies should be revolutionary and mass-oriented. Indeed, China is currently in a state of rapid turmoil, and serious national crises are before us. Movies that depict romantic love between men and women and shallow, comical movies are not needed. Undoubtedly, the general public has understood that movies are by no means for the enjoyment of a few idle people, nor are they the product of some surreal inspiration. Movies themselves are a form of serious social education and a powerful tool for promoting social progress.</p>
<p>However, most of the current Chinese actors grow up in big cities, live in luxurious Western-style houses, wear gorgeous clothes, enjoy rich wine, and go everywhere in cars, all of which demonstrates a life under the glittering gold of capitalism. Therefore, in this situation, even if there are excellent scripts depicting the suffering of oppressed villagers in rural areas, the cruelty of small businessmen being exploited by large capitalists, and the brutality of imperialism trampling on weak nations, the actors simply have not experienced or paid attention to the suffering of the oppressed. They often ruin a very valuable script, which is a pity. It is just like a poet who was born in the tropics. No matter how others explain to him the beauty and purity of winter snow, or even if he himself gathers materials about snow from various sources, he still cannot write good poems because he has never seen it with his own eyes. Similarly, in film art, if actors usually do not pay attention to the various expressions of proletarian life, even if the director explains it from many aspects during the performance, the effect is still like scratching an itch from outside one's boots. There is always a kind of distance, and of course, great and profound works cannot be produced under such circumstances.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that actors will often go among the people. Only in this way can they understand the lives of ordinary people and empathize with their hardships and difficulties, just like Mrs. Buck in America, because she had previously experienced rural life and was familiar with the psychological state of farmers, she was able to write novels that shocked the literary world. I hope that actors will often go among the people because only there can they find the object you want to study and enhance your art of expression.</p>

<h3 id="e240">Yang Naimei to Go to Hong Kong <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Mai</p>
<p>From This Point On, Leave the Silver Screen</p>
<p>Since Yang Naimei married Chen Xunmin, she has completely changed her previous romantic attitude. She is obedient and absolutely submissive to everything Chen desires. However, there is one thing she cannot obey, and that is "acting." Chen's original intention was that since she is now someone's wife, she should no longer reveal her beauty on the silver screen. However, Naimei had a prior agreement and had to fulfill her task, so she had to disobey Chen's orders. Although Chen was dissatisfied, he had to understand, so the feelings between the two did not deteriorate. However, Naimei did not want the feelings between the couple to change again, so her definite intention is that she will never pursue a career on the silver screen again.</p>

<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>From this, we can know that from now on, all those who have already enjoyed the glory of stardom, if they do not constantly seek progress in the art of acting, their failure is certain. Because in the near future, there will definitely be a group of people who are more ambitious, more patient, and more courageous than them, who will show their talent on the screen, take their place, and replace them. By that time, the current group who rely solely on relatives and friends will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>Fellow art lovers! Please don't be afraid! "Success depends on human effort!" "Where there's a will, there's a way!" These are timeless truths! Summon your courage! Stand tall! March forward relentlessly on the road to stardom! Strive to give yourself a unique training! Resolve to create yourself into a future star! It all depends on whether you have the perseverance and determination to continue to work hard according to my unique learning methods, to practice continuously, and even after you succeed, you must continue to work hard!</p>
<p>Friend! Do you still have any doubts about my words of encouragement? Can't you believe in yourself? It doesn't matter! This is just your insatiable heart playing tricks. An insatiable heart is beneficial to you. People without this insatiable heart will become complacent. Complacency will limit your own progress.</p>
<p>Friend! I tell you! You must preserve your insatiable heart! But you must quickly burn away this part of your lack of confidence with the fire of perseverance! From today onwards, you must absolutely believe in yourself! You must believe that you have the ability to become a successful star!</p>
