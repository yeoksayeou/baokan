<h3 id="c23">國聯開會之結果晦 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>國際聯盟行政院會議。自上月二十一日開會。而十九委員會。而特别大會。又復委託十九委員會建議。其中除經過若干往復程序外。僅有中日兩國代表之激烈舌戰。英外相西門且同情於日本代表爲之辯護。雖據報載。英方已</p>
<p>迭向我當局婉詞解釋。謂西門用意。在促進和解。並無偏袒任何　方之意但證之最近十九委員會。會議情形。門尙無事實足以表明其無偏袒之態度也。國聯旣爲英法兩國所操縱。其他各小國。雖欲主張公道。其奈實力薄弱。言而不能决。即决亦不能實行。故此次特别大會中。哀爾蘭·西班牙·捷克·瑞典·四國所提「九一八事變之非自衛手段。」「否認滿洲國。」兩項。爲李頓報告書所是認者亦被葬去。而五國分科　員會對中日糾紛（會議四週。）旣漠視中國堂堂正正之公理。復不敢開罪於蠻橫用武之日本。其所起草之决議文。雖未公佈。而决議案大要可分以下四點。</p>
<p>「一、調解委員會對李頓調查團表示謝意。蓋該團曾作成足供參考利用之報告書故也。」</p>
<p>「二、確認本年三月十一日國聯大會之决議。」</p>
<p>「三、十九國委員會當加入中日兩國代表。俾便進行調解。」</p>
<p>「四、招請美俄兩國。希望其參加調解事業。」</p>
<p>十九國委員會之功績。國際聯盟之評價。已由上述决案全形反映。國人從此更多一重新認。識得一次深刻敎訓矣。</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>然則英法兩國。幷非與遠東絕無關聯。對我國邦交尙稱親睦。而市場競爭之於日本帝國主義。尤難協同一致。何以竟由旁觀而至於對日諒解對華進攻耶。</p>
<p>英國自去年九月二十脫離金本位之後。其於世界金融市塲之信用低落。今後欲力圖恢復。殆爲必然之途徑。故先從事於其内政之整理。組織舉國一致内閣。在此種政制之下。增加所得稅消費稅以及關稅。節約社會政策之費用。總之在内爲牲犧勤勞大衆。在外爲加緊剝削殖民地半殖民地以求恢復。</p>
<p>預算之平衡。渥大華英帝國經濟會議而後。英帝國乃自成一經濟單位。實行閉關主義。一擲其傳統的自由貿易政策。採用保護關稅制。結果重新獲得金融政策上之獨立性。及英蘭銀行現金準備之增加。然而戰債問題陡起風波。英法聯合又生裂痕失業困難未嘗解决國際紛爭忽趨激劇。乃不能不復運用其舊策東結日本以圖遠東方面之安全。冀對華市塲之穩固也。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>法蘭西在歐洲大陸。縱横一世。而世界經濟恐慌以來。彼受創殊淺。迄乎近日。其金融市塲亦陷於梗塞狀態。庫中存金雖日見加多。資本流動反愈減少。財政不足。致金融資源枯竭。歐洲大陸各國。無不在驚風駭浪中。希圖暫時之偷安。故法國吸收現金愈多。則國際借貸關係愈趨惡化。換言之。即高率關稅實行之後。輸入旣受限制。而國外購買力低落。輸出貿易。惟有惡化。而追求投資塲所。爲法國當前之急務。蘇聯固爲其對　之一。遠東之中國。尤爲適宜。然而非厚結日本。難保其對華投資不受積極妨礙也。是故法雖不願日本獨呑東北。而形隔勢禁。亦無力過問耳。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>北美合衆國爲歐戰而後之暴發戶。奮其金圓勢力。君臨東亞。我國之疲。日本之横。亦難與對敵。然而一年以來受歐洲衰落之影響。遇濬陽事變之激盪。致使恐慌愈甚。失業人數逾一千萬。現金流出約近十萬萬。財政預算。七月迄今四個月之間。收入不足竟達六萬萬美金以上。其困乏之狀。可以想見焉有餘力以對日。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>蘇聯方與我國恢復尋常外交。且正着其全力於國内建設。旣非國聯會員。豈能代國聯受過。况彼仍堅持其冷靜觀察態度。决不經於發言。故對十九國委員會之邀請亦表示婉謝。蓋審知國聯無法裁制日本暴行。况十九委員。猶居於國聯之下乎。如於此時參加調解。事旣無補徒惹起日人之譏評。取得我國之反感。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>國聯之無力。早已大白於世界。列强之情勢。又如上述無論爲左右日内瓦外交之英法。與立於國聯以外之美蘇。或則欲分嗜盃夔或者空自嘆息。或則冷眼旁觀。要皆無補於我國之痛苦也。吾人其能長此等待永不可期之國聯所持公道之裁斷。而實受日本軍閥之蹂躪。而不亟起以自力奮爭耶。</p>
<p>猶憶本年九月十八日。中央黨部告國人書有云。『有理可講則講理。無理可講則角力。』此次國聯特别大會。吾人已盡其最後一次之忠誠。忍痛泣血以講理。而結果何如。豈但理不可講。且已無法再講。而今而後。捨『角力』之外。</p>
<p>寗有他途哉。</p>

<p>决議草案空泛含混</p>
<p>追述三月十一日决議組織調解會請中日美俄參加</p>
<p>對調查團表示謝忱並建議以李頓報告爲調解基礎</p>
<p>爲日本預留狡辯地步</p>
<p>英外相西門袒日顯明</p>
<p>對解决期限並未規定</p>
<p>中日代表各向本國政府請示</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國特委會小組委員會擬定之决議草案、因受英國袒日之影響、以致頗爲空泛含混、一若爲日本預留狡辯地步也者、設英外相西門星期三不返倫敦、則所得結果、當較此尤惡、據中央社記者探悉、小組委員會初稿對於調解基礎、僅及規定以和平方法解决爭端之國聯盟約及凱格非戰公約、而未列入明定保障中國領土行政完整之九國公約、經我國代表要求、始行加入、又决議草案中對於解决時限並未規定、僅言十九國特委會應於明年三月一日向大會報告調解成績、而非提出建議、（十六日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）聞十九特委會十五日晚所核准之决議草案、内分四項、㈠對於李頓調查團之工作表示欽感、而以其報告書用於調解委員會之工作中、㈡重行確定三月十一日之决議案、㈢提議以十九特委會爲調解委員會、而輔以中日代表、㈣宜請美俄參加調解工作云、（十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國委員會内小組委員會所準備之决議案草案、業於今日草竣、送與中日代表團領袖閱看、俟得同意、再行提出國聯大會、至其内容、各委員雖力守秘密、但據可靠方面傳出、此次决議案比較空泛而不擔負干係、或將須請委員會重行試擬也、</p>
<p>又聞今日十九國委員會曾開會片刻、通過小組委員會所草三種文件、準備得中日同意後、即行提出國聯大會、</p>
<p>（第一文件）即係建議前述之决議案草案、其内容大致由國聯大會重申上次大會三月十一日决議案大綱、各會員國自行保證對於凡用違反盟約與非戰公約規定方法所產生之任何事態或條約、槪不承認、次乃注重於盟約非戰公約與九國公約之條件、再次遂建議設立調解委員會、即以十九國委員爲委員、並加入中國兩當事國、而美國與蘇俄因有鉅大利益於遠東、亦當一體邀請參加、此項調解委員會當考慮李頓報告第九與第十兩章、而於明年三月一日提出報告、</p>
<p>（第二文件）聞頗簡短、僅對於李頓調查團中正不阿之工作、表示感謝而已、</p>
<p>（第三文件）共長兩頁、詳述十九國委員會草擬决議案之理由、在此報告内、力言國聯大會宜照盟約第十五條第三節規定、採取調解手段、並說明邀請美俄參加調解之必要、謂李頓報告内叙述滿案歷史部份、不徧不倚、旣主張回復原狀與承認「滿洲國」俱屬不可能、因此有覓取若干折衷辦法之必要、</p>
<p>又聞國聯中人態度、希望國聯大會最後决議案、將充分空泛而不擔負干係、以期取悅日本、俾日人可繼續參加調解工作、但委員會之决議案則當稍事强硬、儘可不問國聯大會之贊成與否、期可取悅中國而得美俄之合作云（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九特委會主席今日對人聲稱、甚活動之談判刻在進行中、以期對於處理中日爭議的調解機關之組織謀取一同意、此項機關將請美俄兩國政府加入、渠於昨日十九特委會會議後、會同國聯秘書長向中日兩國代表探訽其對於此項辦法之意見、渠已與雙方接洽此事、現待兩國政府之覆電、國聯大會大約因此將延緩數日始能開會云、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）昨日十九特委會所通過之决議案、曾檢點份數、而於散會後封藏、足證會議機密之一斑、聞十九特委會建議應以該會爲調解委員會、而輔以中日代表、該委員會應於六個月内向國聯提出報告、按顏惠慶博士主張此點數月於茲、以爲如在指定之時期内調解無效、則調解委員會應繕具報告、届時或有制裁之主張也、李頓報告書第九第十兩章所載之調解辦法、當可得成功之機會、十九特委會對於爭點是非、决議不表示任何意見、以免有偏袒之嫌疑、但將重行確定三月十一日之决議案、不承認違背盟約而成之變更、此舉在使各小國滿意、蓋小國已勉强放棄不承認「滿洲國」之主張也、國聯大會大約將於下星期一二日開會討論此决議案、衆料此次開會後、全部問題將延至明年再行處理、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）關於起草委員會之工作、續得消息如下、起草委員會已於昨日通過决議案二件及理由說明書一件、其第一部分工作已告完成、而調解中日爭端所應根據之原則、亦已確定、至調解程序、則起草委員會主張組織一小委員會、以專家及特别合格之人物充任之、或即指李頓調查團團員而言、亦未可知、起草委員會並建議非常大會應邀請美俄兩國參加、十九國委員會因此改組爲二十一國委員會、按照國聯會盟約、中日爭端最後報告書應於六個月内發表、後經非常大會决定延期、中國代表再三要求確定發表期限、上項理由說明書即所以滿足中國方面之要求、該說明書謂調解委員會當在本年底内確定最後報告書提出之期限、如調解委員工作告成、則最後報告書僅叙述事實經過、若調解失敗、則最後報告書乃包括各項建議案、至於調解工作所應根據之原則、按之理由說明書、則國聯盟約·非戰公約·及華盛頓九國公約·首當注意、繼及追述大會三月十一日之决議案、即不承認用暴力所造成之局面、又叙述李頓報告書第九章關於調解之原則、及第十章關於調解之方式、李頓報告書第九章勸以廣泛之自治權賦予滿洲、幷組織一憲兵隊而撤退其他一切軍隊、並由國際合作以建設中國、李頓報告書第十章提議召集一諮詢會議、任中日雙方代表及滿洲居民代表團兩組參加之、此項代表團一由中國規定之方法選出之、一由日本規定之方法選出之、此外中立觀察員亦可參加該會議、若遇意見不同時則請由國聯會行政院解决之、理由說明書並聲明所有提出之辦法、係以盟約第十五條第三節爲根據、所以未加評斷者、則以調解工作必須自由運用故也、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>徒成日本及各大國之機關</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯對於解决中日爭案意圖延宕、已無可諱言、國聯徒成爲日本及各大國之國聯、日本需要延宕、完成其在東三省之計劃、國聯自學前　無望、亦歡迎延宕苟全其顏面、至各大國則爲避免日本之反抗、亦以爲不如聽其自然發展、不解决而解决、在此種形勢之下、我國遂幷一紙上之滿意的解决而不可得矣、（十六日中央社電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）中代表團對於十九特委會提交大會之草案、認爲甚屬失望、今日中代表團發言人聲稱、决議草案與吾人所期望者、相差甚遠、依照國聯盟約、中國應享有限期報告之權利、今草案並未規定最後報告之限期、此層尤令人失望、再、草案中未有應付東三省時局之條文、亦無阻止日本繼續侵略之辦法云、（路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）十九國特委會秘密會議所通過之决議案、雖未　露、茲據可靠消息、該决議案其徇從日本之意旨、故中國代表團對之殊形冷淡云、（十六日國民電）</p>

<p>國會競選揭曉之時、英法美俄輿論、皆直捷而明顯地下過斷語、謂德國法西斯主義運動、業已到了最高時期、今後當不會再有若何進展、彼等豫言、眞是十足睇穿、考其所以致此失敗原因、本極複雜、但是要而言之、約有下列主因、</p>
<p>㈠人民逐漸發覺Hitler之主張、多虚浮而不近實際、</p>
<p>㈡Hitler經濟政策、日趨激烈的共產主義化、喪失中產階級歡心、</p>
<p>㈢洛桑會議容認德國停止賠欵要求、緩和了德人仇外心、</p>
<p>㈣Hitler黨徒過於横行、不絕地與共產黨衝突、發生流血慘案、引起社會不安、使人民發生厭恨、</p>
<p>㈤Hitler經過總統及七月三十一日國會兩次競選運動失敗後、氣衰力竭、運動之狂潮退落、</p>
<p>具此五因、則法西斯主義之必呈衰落、是亦勢所必然之理也、社會民主黨、因其態度比較溫和安定、此次選舉結果、雖較前次競選、亦略有退縮、但仍屬爲國會第二重要政黨、中央黨因自白呂寗内閣倒閉後、政權旁落、加以黨内白呂寗與巴本意見分歧、呈有分崩離析之狀、且對於德國目前經濟恐慌及失業問題、又無具體解决計劃與主張、該黨價値已逐漸喪失、所以此次國會選舉結果、祇得六十九位議席、但是極左德國共產黨、在此次國會競選、選民票數有驚人迅速之增加、亦可謂在此次國會競選獲得最大勝利之政黨、佔國會議席一百位、爲第三重要政黨、此次共產黨票數之激增、使極右之國家社會勞働黨、受莫大之威脅、即在世界輿論及政治上、亦不能不令人重視、查共產黨票數增加原因、一則因由於德國經濟恐慌及失業工人問題所惹起、二則因爲反資本主義及世界革命思潮日臻發達和緊張所致、</p>
<p>現在新國會旣巳再行選出、議席之分配、已如前述、但各政黨由極左以至極右、單獨皆未能佔得議會絕對大多數議席、然則所謂議會政府的大多數派、將如何組合與產生、此次國會再選、共得五七七位議員、在絕對大多數派、應占二八九位議員、國家社會勞働黨、祇有一九五議員、當然還是相去此數甚遠、單獨未能成爲議會中絕對大多數派、左派共產黨及社會民主黨合計、得議員二二一、其勢較右派爲大、但究是亦未能達到議會絕對大多數派資格祇有共產黨能和右派、即國家社會勞働派合作、可得議員二九五位、能成絕對大多數派、究之此兩黨、一則向左轉一則向右跑、背道而馳、意見如冰炭之不能相容、貓與鼠能夠合作、實屬敎人極難相信、總此而論、可知德國新國會之組合、政府大多數派問題、其困難情形、與當時七三、國會困難狀况、同出一轍、前途實屬非常灰色而黯淡、</p>
<p>巴本前次解决七三一選出之國會、正因國會不能組成政府絕對大多數派所致、假令此次再選之新國會、仍不能拉成政府絕對大多數派、則巴本内閣又將如何處置、此問題若果巴本不能找得正當途徑之解决、則其内閣命運、不免因國會再選而要陷於倒閉、巴本曾在此次國會再選之前夕、藉放聲機之傳達、向德國全體國民、作極沉痛之選舉演講、並明白表示放棄他從來袒右之態度、力陳右左各政黨行爲之非分、提出一種新的主張、所謂超政黨政治、他認爲在德國處於當前的萬分險惡與窮苦的時局、四分五裂和意見分歧的政黨、無濟時艱、此後救國唯一出路、祇有須要全體國人以國家民族全體利益爲前題、立於同一戰綫及集團、受指揮於勞苦功高的興登堡總統之下、庶幾可收救亡實效、換言之、巴本此種意見、即主張今後國會、當離開政黨分堅之方向、應組成超政黨的混合議會政府大多數派、此種所謂超政黨的混合工作問題、目前輿論界亦深表同情、形成目前新選國會核心與焦點但巴本此種新主張、究　能爲各政黨所接納與否、甚少希望、爲了他在此次國便再選前夕之演講、大肆攻擊右左派、正是惹得共黨及Hitler黨徒極度之憤恨、大有非立刻推翻巴本内閣不可之勢、所以現在新選出國會議員、差不多皆爲反對巴本之人、亦即可謂皆具反政府態度、如此荆棘重重之難關、想巴本不易於打破也、在巴本方面、雖有國家憲法第四十八條可爲保全地位之護符、在國會不能組成政府大數多派或有其他任何困難問題不能解决時、可適用國家憲法第四十八條、下令解散國會再選、須知自巴本上塲長内閣以來、曾經兩次因議會提出不信任案而致下令解散國會、人民即不勝選舉之繁苦、而在經濟上立論、兩次選舉、統計耗費七千七百萬馬克、所以選舉越多、亦越加增國民之負擔、今後若果巴本尙欲藉此憲法條文賦予、以爲對待國會及保全自己護符、最後或不免要激成各黨實際革命行動、愈陷政局於不安、巴本現在已定兩星期後、與興登堡大總統會商、决其對於新國會之態度與步驟、新國會開會時期、依憲法規定、應在選舉後一個月以内舉行、官方對此事、直至記者握管時、仍未有公告、但在輿論上推測、要在十二月六日、方能召集第一次新國會會議云云、於德國佛萊堡、</p>

<p>談西北綫開航重要</p>
<p>昨晚返京報告詳情</p>
<p>日日社云、歐亞航空公司、於本月十四日董事會推交通部總務司長李景樅、任該公司總經理、李已於昨晨九時到該公司就職視事、幷已電呈交通部及通知各機站、日日社記者、昨日上午、往訪李氏、承發表談話、對改組原因及西北綫通航之困難及重要、見告甚詳、茲誌李氏談話如下、</p>
<p>（改組原因）　余（李氏自稱）原任交通部總務司長、事務殷繁、本不能兼顧公司職務、奈前總經理王志遠、因東北救國軍事繁責重、不克兼任、力懇辭職、朱家驊部長、不得已以余承乏、茲於今日（昨日）接事、查歐亞西北航綫、不特與開發西北有密切關係、於國際上尤具有偉大價値、深望各界時加援助、俾能日增發展、</p>
<p>（通航困難）　歐亞航綫西北段、原定十五日正式開航、嗣因起飛時、機件稍生障碍、故順延一日、已於今日（即昨日）正式開航、不過現雖開航、其困難之點尙多、茲將其較關重要者、列述如次、㈠關於機件者、公司機件、原不甚多、加之數月來時有毀損、現所餘者、極屬有限、以在此綫上、每星期作往返約一萬公里航程之飛航、即使沿途毫不發生阻碍、已覺分配困難、而新添之機件、至速非遲至明年二月不能運到、此其困難者一、㈡關於地面設備者、西北氣候嚴寒、時届十月、即已上凉、在此種境地、欲求能按班飛行、非有棚廠房屋、以及取暖等設備、殊難爲力、數月内對此尙未計及、現在自屬無法建築、他如無綫電測候器等、關係飛航、万屬重要、亦均未經籌備、而内地又供不應求、無法就地購辦、自非徐徐運往、逐漸布置不可、此其困難者二、㈢關於人員者、查公司係專辦空中運輸、且屬中德合辦、所有德籍挍術員、來華均不及二年、自不能賣其即能通曉華語、故爲求辦事順利管理方便起見、對於高級華員、總以還用有航空及商業學識、幷能兼通德語者爲宜、故物色本已不易、而一般國人心理、又每視西北爲長途</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>、多裏足不敢前往、其實西北蘊藏、遠較内地各省豐富、崦氣候亦較江南一帶爲乾爽、况公司係開發空中交通、西北雖遠隔萬里、今後之往返飛行、不過三數日行程、但此辈人才、雖經曉喻、仍多難色、此其困難者一二、于於沿途汽油之存運、機場之建築等項、當余去年試航新疆時、均已分别令由公司或託由地方官廳代辦、已不成問題、總之、無論如何困難、余决將於最短期内、設法使之力臻完善、籍以副朱部長及社會人士之期望、</p>
<p>（通航重要）　西北段航綫全部完成後、所有寄歐郵件、已可由公司飛機、運往中俄邊境之塔城、轉交西比利亞火車、於十三四日内到達歐州、現在中俄旣已復交、關於飛航直達歐洲辦法、更易進行則將來歐亞航空郵件　只須五六日即可運到、而政府對於封鎖東北郵政之最初目的、亦可以澈底實現、余一俟一切設施均臻妥善時、尙擬親自飛往俄國　行、以便與俄當局商洽、關於公司飛機運載郵件、經過俄境、飛往歐洲、或先在中俄邊境、暫用飛機聯運等之切實辦法云云、</p>
<p>（電呈交部）　李氏昨日就職後、分别電呈交部、幷通知各飛機站、茲探錄原文於下、㈠敬呈者、准歐亞航空公司董事會函開、茲經公司第十六次董事會决議、推定景樅爲歐亞航空公司副董事長　幷由董事長指定兼總經理等由、准此、景樅遵於十二月十六日到公司就職視事、理合呈報鈞部鑒核備案、謹呈交通部、㈡南京交通部部長朱次長俞張鈞鑒、景樅經歐亞航空公司董事會、推定充副董事長兼任公司總經理、定於本日到公司任職、謹此電陳、歐亞航空公司總經理李景樅叩、銑、</p>
<p>（通知各站）　逕啓者、准歐亞航空公司董事會函開、茲經公司第十六次董事會决議、推定景樅爲歐亞航空公司副董事長、幷由董事長指定兼任總經理等由、准此、景樅遵於十二月十六日、到公司就職視事、除呈報交通部幷分函外、相應函達查照、此致站長、</p>
<p>（昨晚返京）　李氏於昨晨到公司接收就職後、以西北航綫正式開航情形、須向交通部長朱家驊報告、特於昨晚搭十一時四十五分夜特快車赴京、面陳一切、幷處理部中公務、聞李氏三四日後、即將返滬、</p>

<p>俄貨在華貿易情形、幾無整個之統計、茲據俄商聲稱、中俄邦交斷絕後、海航停頓輸運賴他國郵船、運費高昂、是以在華貿易、五年來年不如年、至運華貨物、以火油布疋爲大宗、但亦因輸運專賴外輸、難與他國競爭、茲者邦交恢復、航路一通、俄貨定能奪取日貨在華勞力云云、</p>

<p>劉鴻生之談話</p>
<p>中央社云、招商局總經理劉鴻生、昨語中央社記者、報載北棧職工、今日（即昨日）復工云云、此事全非事實、蓋北棧職工、從未有罷工之風潮也、此次五棧職工、雖因拒何問題、曾來局請願收回成命、但經解釋後、衆亦明白回去、而何鐵華亦已接事辦公、各員工等亦照常服務、從未間斷、昨日據報告、該棧運貨有百五十餘件、此可證明罷工之說全屬子虚、今次之風潮、據本人推測或爲一二員工爲恐自身被裁、故從中鼓動、局方對此並不加以重視、茲就華棧而言、該棧每月職員薪金在十七年本月爲七百九十八元、今年本月則漸增至二千五百七十元、四年來增至三倍有奇、而收入方面、去今兩年僅四千三百兩、而資產之官利及折舊、尙不計算在内、若以銀元計算、四千餘兩約合六千元、以之支付薪水、僅六個月、此種現象、殊屬駭異、招商局從前之腐敗、亦可推見其一斑、至關於整個之整頓計劃、雖非短時間内所能草擬、但對各部份之積弊、則須隨時加以整飭云、</p>

<p>包志正君訊，我是一個時代落伍者，我在於農村經濟衰落不得已情形之下而終於承繼了祖業，│巫醫│但是我的精神已受了極大的打擊，我心房好似穿進了一把尖銳的利刄│，我　了時代的輪子而轉進了十七年冬，忽得到江蘇省政府民政廳廢除卜筮星相巫現堪輿七項辨法的消息我在混沌之中，頻受了許多感想，其廢除辨法第三條有「···限期届滿，尙無正當職業者，應收入地方設立之工廠，改習一業其未設有工廠之地方得令其擔負相當工作···」等語，（上文是令縣政府轉飭公安局者）無奈本地並無工廠，我就是有心改業，也無機會而公安局不與以相當工作，反勒令照常營業，他太太少設有疾病，也延我們替他祈禱但這是盡義務的，除此以外，他就百般苛索，從中每月攫取了許多黑費，我們在這種威迫之下生活了四年，屢次要想一個策對的方法，但無機會現在萬幸看見了貴報讀者顧問我就欣幸地寫出兩個疑問，㈠如何對付公安局，以解脫這牽掣的痛苦？㈡敝地做此業者約有九十餘家，合計以此生活之人總在五百口以上，爲全體設想若是解脫以後有何良法謀生，去踏進那新的出路？先生，慈愛的先生，以上兩個問題，是有關我們五百人生死關頭，就請你在貴報發表，給大家討論一回</p>
<p>▲記者按包君所提出的實際問題、不僅充分地暴露了政治的黑暗面、而這充分地暴露了這社會的黑暗面、且問題極有公開討論的價値、茲特提交大家公開討論、</p>
<p>伍思敬君訊這裏我有一個百思不解其故的問題，要請先生來替我作一個比較切實而負責的答復，同時，像我所感受到的痛苦的人，社會上一定很多，所以我希望先生能夠把我這信公布出來，給大家來共同討論一下。我是一個舊制高中畢業生，照現社會經濟狀况，我居然能夠畢業舊制高中，我已萬分滿足，回頭看看，有多少人進不得中學，更有多少人進不得小學，我眞的已經心滿意足了，畢業之後，我就開始踏進社會，找職業做，自然，我是抱着十二萬分的熱誠，來服務社會的，我不欺騙，我不偷懶，我要就我能力之所及，做我所應做的，我不肯遷就黑暗腐敗，我要保存我的坦白眞誠，我自信我的意向，並未錯誤，我的前途是光明的，但，奇怪，許多賢人鞏哲，中西學者的格言名訓，竟欺騙我了，我自己檢閱自己的行爲，同這些格言名訓，大致都沒有違誤，然而，我竟然碰壁了，在服務社會三年之後，我竟終歸失敗而失業，我家庭是很貧寒的，我之得以畢業中學，父母也費了不少力氣，自然，我是非招職業不足以生存，但是招職業談何容易，我雖沒有甚麽高深的學問，然而，還有相當的謀生薄技，我有權要求社會給我以工作，我不能活活等死，先生，我爲什銷招不到職業，我走過歌樓舞樹，酒館飯館之前，他們，誰都興高彩烈，飽餓之不足，繼之以酒肉繼之以　妓侑觴，而我，爲什麽飯也吃不成，我還算沒有餓死呢，先生，你看你的周圍左右，還有多少人，已經餓得成了一根枯柴呵，先生，這是什麽道理，天嗎，我不相信，個人的命運嗎，證據又在那裏，先生，我這裏的問題，就是，一爲什麽少數人不必靠他的學問能力，就可以有飯吃，而多數誠實坦白有相當謀生技能的人，反而沒有飯吃，　先生，我是大家，來替我解答一下吧，</p>
<p>記者按，我一口氣讀完了伍君這封信，心頭又突被壓上了一塊大石，什麽也說不出。自然這也是一個値得討論的問題，現在就提交大家討論罷，包君訊：友人×某君，僅於初中肄業一學期，卽被其父强迫入商，爲時二年，今春因其父營業失敗，對商界頗感消極，某君遂乘間請其父赴杭入某中校求學，成績甚佳，其父亦欣喜，乃其父近又欲重振旗鼓，函囑其歸去勁助，某君賦性純孝，不歸，恐傷老父心，如歸去，又感到自己學識之不足，而不願離開學校，思想的衝突，遂使其蹈入苦悶之環境，日前×君來函，以此慮商及，鄙人以智識淺陋，不足爲人解惑，特轉請敎於先生，尙望詳加指導，俾×君得所適從也，關於×君家庭，其父經商多年曾積資念餘萬，失敗後，亦可稱小康，有兄三，長兄亦業商，二三兄均染嗜好無職業，因其兩兄如此，是其父須其歸去　助，而又爲×君之不不忍歸不歸一原因也，</p>
<p>覆」·貴友「性情純孝「，有志向學，甚爲可敬，貴友之父，因諸子不肖，而必欲令貴友輟學助其營商，其打算雖欠正確，其苦心則亦可原諒，此問題之解决，以記者之見，可否由貴友懇請戚族中較負聲望而又較爲親切之人，向貴友之父親解說，使其明瞭求學之緊要，（如二三兩子不務正業，正坐不學之故，亦可提出作爲證明，）而迴其固執之見，想以貴友與其父親之感情，貴友求學之志又如此其堅，其父親亦必不忍過拂其志願也，</p>

<p>包志正君訊，我是一個時代落伍者，我在於農村經濟衰落不得已情形之下而終於承繼了祖業，│巫醫│但是我的精神已受了極大的打擊，我心房好似穿進了一把尖銳的利刄│，我　了時代的輪子而轉進了十七年冬，忽得到江蘇省政府民政廳廢除卜筮星相巫現堪輿七項辨法的消息我在混沌之中，頻受了許多感想，其廢除辨法第三條有「···限期届滿，尙無正當職業者，應收入地方設立之工廠，改習一業其未設有工廠之地方得令其擔負相當工作···」等語，（上文是令縣政府轉飭公安局者）無奈本地並無工廠，我就是有心改業，也無機會而公安局不與以相當工作，反勒令照常營業，他太太少設有疾病，也延我們替他祈禱但這是盡義務的，除此以外，他就百般苛索，從中每月攫取了許多黑費，我們在這種威迫之下生活了四年，屢次要想一個策對的方法，但無機機現在萬幸看見了貴報讀者顧問我就欣幸地寫出兩個疑問，㈠如何對付公安局，以解脫這牽掣的痛苦？㈡敝地做此業者約有九十餘家，合計以此生活之人總在五百口以上，爲全體設想若是解脫以復有何良法謀生，去踏進那新的出路？先生，慈愛的先生，以上兩個問題，是有關我們五百人生死關頭，就請你在貴報發表，給大家討論一回</p>
<p>▲記者按包君所提出的實際問題、不僅充分地暴露了政治的黑暗面、而這充分地暴露了這社會的黑暗面、且問題極有公開討論的價値、茲特提交大家公開討論、</p>
<p>伍思敬君訊這裏我有一個百思不解其故的問題，要請先生來替我作一個比較切實而負責的答復，同時，像我所感受到的痛苦的人，社會上一定很多，所以我希望先生能夠把我這信公布出來，給大家來共同討論一下。我是一個舊制高中畢業生，照現社會經濟狀况，我居然能夠畢業舊制高中，我已萬分滿足，回頭看看，有多少人進不得中學，更有多少人進不得小學，我眞的已經心滿意足了，畢業之後，我就開始踏進社會，找職業做，自然，我是抱着十二萬分的熱誠，來服務社會的，我不欺騙，我不偷懶，我要就我能力之所及，做我所應做的，我不肯遷就黑暗腐敗，我要保存我的坦白眞誠，我自信我的意向，並未錯誤，我的前途是光明的，但，奇怪，許多賢人鞏哲，中西學者的格言名訓，竟欺騙我了，我自己檢閱自己的行爲，同這些格言名訓，大致都沒有違誤，然而，我竟然碰壁了，在服務社會三年之後，我竟終歸失敗而失業，我家庭是很貧寒的，我之得以畢業中學，父母也費了不少力氣，自然，我是非招職業不足以生存，但是招職業談何容易，我雖沒有甚麽高深的學問，然而，還有相當的謀生薄技，我有權要求社會給我以工作，我不能活活等死，先生，我爲什銷招不到職業，我走過歌樓舞樹，酒館飯館之前，他們，誰都興高彩烈，飽餓之不足，繼之以酒肉繼之以　妓侑觴，而我，爲什麽飯也吃不成，我還算沒有餓死呢，先生，你看你的周圍左右，還有多少人，已經餓得成了一根枯柴呵，先生，這是什麽道理，天嗎，我不相信，個人的命運嗎，證據又在那裏，先生，我這裏的問題，就是，一爲什麽少數人不必靠他的學問能力，就可以有飯吃，而多數誠實坦白有相當謀生技能的人，反而沒有飯吃，　先生，我是磊家，來替我解答一下吧，</p>
<p>記者按，我一口氣讀完了伍君這封信，心頭又突被壓上了一塊大石，什麽也說不出。自然這也是一個値得討論的問題，現在就提交大家討論罷，包君訊：友人×某君，僅於初中肄業一學期，卽被其父强迫入商，爲時二年，今春因其父營業失敗，對商界頗感消極，某君遂乘間請其父赴杭入某中校求學，成績甚佳，其父亦欣喜，乃其父近又欲重振旗鼓，函囑其歸去　助，某君賦性純孝，不歸，恐傷老父心，如歸去，又感到自己學識之不足，而不願離開學校，思想的衝突，遂使其蹈入苦悶之環境，日前×君來函，以此慮商及，鄙人以智識淺陋，不足爲人解惑，特轉請敎於先生，尙望詳加指導，俾×君得所適從也，關於×君家庭，其父經商多年曾積資念餘萬，失敗後，亦柯稱小康，有兄三，長兄亦業商，二三兄均染嗜好無職業，因其兩兄如此，是其父須其歸去　助，而又爲×君之不不忍歸不歸一原因也，</p>
<p>覆」·貴友「性情純孝「，有志向學，甚爲可敬，貴友之父，因諸子不肖，而必欲令貴友輟學助其營商，其打算雖欠正確，其苦心則亦可原諒，此問題之解决，以記者之見，可否由貴友懇請戚族中較負聲望而又較爲親切之人，向貴友之父親解說，使其明瞭求學之緊要，（如二三兩子不務正業，正坐不學之故，亦可提出作爲證明，）而迴其固執之見，想以貴友與其父親之感情，貴友求學之志又如此其堅，其父親亦必不忍過拂其志願也，</p>

<p>— 廖茂如</p>
<p>就經騐論、就學理論、就近代趨勢論、中學授課鐘點、萬不應增加、那麽致育部的毅然增加、究竟根據什麽理由、</p>
<p>在敎部的本意、以爲各科目時間增加後、學生的程度一定會提高、不知實際上適得其反、功課不認眞的學校、不要說每週規定上三十五小時課、就是上四十八小時都沒有用、因爲敎師可以隨意缺課、學生可以無端逃課、就在上課時候、也知莊　宣先生所描寫的那幅課室聽證圖、日常旣無指定的工作、攷查又無嚴密的方法、師生都在「混」字裏討生活、功課認眞的學校、各科目每天有工作給學生做、每週有臨時試騐、每月有月考、每學期有一次總溫習│學期試騐、多數的敎師、　循循善誘、惟恐學生得益少、像這種學校、每星期上二十餘小時課、已經很忙了、因爲學生尙有體育和羣育方面的活動、鐘點增加後、敎師祇得减少指定的工作、學生祇得减少自習的時間、結果是程度低落、</p>
<p>總結上邊的話、授課時間增加後、發生的效用是、㈠自修時間不敷、㈡運動時間缺乏、㈢妨碍課外作業、㈣降低各科程度、</p>
<h3 id="c183">二、取消文理分科太不注意事實 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>我國第一次規定的學制、沒有實行、第二次頒布的學制、中學課程一切固定、並不分科、至宣統年間、中學開始文實分科、民國初年、雖有取消文實分科的辦法、然不久卽行恢復、在淸代興學的時期、中學生的人數很少、數理的程度也並不十分高、進中學的人、大都抱一升學的希望、所以文理不分科、尙可勉强、然而在宣統時候、對於文實分科的辦法、已經辯論得很烈了、現時中學的人數、一年加多一年、因此志願能力更參差不一、幷且投攷大學的數理程度、比較以前提高了許多（可以交通大學爲例）、現在不屬靑年的能力怎樣、志願怎樣、一律敎他們用同樣的時間學習同樣的敎材、遲鈍的望洋興歎、優秀的動受牽制、怎麽行呢、</p>
<p>猜敎部的心理、以爲中學的課程都是基本的、個個學生都應該學、也沒有一個學生學不來、所以固定一律是不生問題的、這個見解距事實又太遠了、小學的課程可以如此看法、初中便不盡然、高中更難說了、性近數理的學生（特别是算學）、興趣濃郁、秉賦特長、書本深些、學習快些、不以爲苦、性近文學的學生、看見算學就頭痛、敎他學習代數·幾何·三角、已很艱苦、再要他學習大代數解析幾何、加工實習、祇有　諸來世了、再就女生說、事實上因難更多了、現時女子中學的學生、差不多有三分之二以上都是學習文科的敎他們驟然改習數理、符合部定的標準、眞是緣木求魚、</p>
<p>或者敎部以爲普通中學校是專預備學生升大學的（這個觀念是否合理暫且不談）所以進中學的人就得預備升學、就得預備請升學的功課、不知道在這種世亂年荒的時代、那一個人决得定兩三年後的事情、如果你調查高一的學生、問他們畢業後是否升學、至少有百分之五十是决不定的就是有確定志願的到了臨時、還得變更、升學的忽然就事了、就事的忽然升學了、人事無定、大抵如斯、所以就需要論、實在沒有個個人學習高深數學的必要、進普通中學的人、决不會個個升大學、升大學的人、也决不會個個投考理工科、需要旣如此、事實又如彼、那麽敎育部爲什麽要取消文理科來作難一般興趣不在、志願不在的靑年呢、不單是作難興趣不在、志願不在的靑年就是興趣在數理的靑年、也受到種種牽制、不能充分發展他們的特殊能力、這是多麽可惜的事、</p>

<p>▲約翰最後勝利　相持未久、約翰主將陳祥龍復遭四次犯規離場、可謂禍不單行、加以敢死動作粗暴、咸爲約翰担憂、但福人天相、約翰當此危岌之時、球勢忽然順利、侯學敏誠景星連連遠射、均告中的、天日重覩、淸雲直上而以四十五比三十七、得最後勝利、敢死兇則兇矣、不得不屈伏焉、</p>

<p>（股市）十五日倫敦電、上週因戰債問題多少淸朗故市况漸見進步、且財部節略對於從新整理財政並不需另徵特稅、故在新氣象中、除金邊公債因債欵稍似縛束外、其他趨勢俱皆良好、德國公債因最近日内瓦軍縮會議加入問題解决、亦見進步　其他外國債劵略見進步後、趨勢不定、日本債劵平靜、中國債劵仍堅穩、實業方面、雖商業沉寂、但價値站定油股因英波油權爭執而波動、礦股甚强　橡皮股見滯、</p>
<p>（外匯）金鎊在平穩進步中、其上升更因法國倒閣、法郎跌價而益顯、中國滙價、因銀縮而軟弱、日匯不定、</p>

<h3 id="c265">在江輪上（一） <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>這故事是起在長江的輪船上。</p>
<p>江水一向是風平浪靜，但在江輪上的旅客的心裏却像是海中的波浪似地不安定。</p>
<p>有一次，一個靑年搭上江輪到長江上流的某鎭去，他的舉止很闊綽，像是一個富家的哥兒·他定的艙位是兩個人同房的官艙。</p>
<p>另外有一個三十多歲的中年人，好像是偶然地，就和他占了同一的房間。這個人的衣冠雖然也很整齊，但一個在人生裏富有經騐的人，可以着得出他的面貌的獰惡。可是他的言談很和藹，不到幾分鐘，已經和他的同房的旅伴非常地親熟了。</p>
<p>船行在江心裏。</p>
<p>在甲板上有三五個像商人似地旅客站着閒談，其中有一個老年人，一望他的打扮，就可以曉得他是一個久走江湖的，不過這個老人是正直的，因爲從他的一雙眼裏發着兩道炯炯的光。</p>
<p>在船上好像是在一個大家庭裏，人們是容易親熱的；不久，那個闊綽的靑年，也站在甲板上同那位老人交談着了。</p>
<p>老年人上下打量了那個富家的哥兒一眼，像是審問一個犯人似地問；</p>
<p>「你是一個初次出門的人吧」？</p>
<p>那個靑年人不關心地微笑着答應了一聲。</p>
<p>「你該當小心些，」那個老年又接着講：「這一條路是不容易走的，年靑的人時常會出事呀。」</p>
<p>這樣說着，老人講了許多關於在長江的輪船上以及碼頭上，所遭遇過的不幸的事件他的話還沒有講完，那個靑年的同房的旅伴的中年人，也凑過來了，他和那個老年人互相打量了一眼，老年人對他也微笑着招呼，可是一抽身就走開了。</p>
<p>夜到了，老年人臥在他的艙房裏，但好像是有一件異常的事，在擾亂着他的心，他不能夠安眠了，他的腦裏極自然地明晰地映着那個兇像的中年人和那個闊綽的靑年的容貌·他心裏想：</p>
<p>「這個人决不像是一個好人，他和那個靑年同住在一個房間裏怕不是偶然的，而且他對他那麽親熱。我已經快六十歲了，我的眼不會看錯的，那個靑年是在危險中了，我應當帮助他！好在我和他們是隣房我可以留心聽到他們的房裏的響聲。」</p>
<h3 id="c266">殉賄坑 <a href="#c266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>山東邱安縣長王鴻烈最近發明了一個懲治貪汚的新法，他命令在縣府前掘一大坑，名曰「殉賄坑。」同時幷頒佈法令：凡縣府所屬各機關，從縣長以至各職員，查明受賄的，都須自投入坑，自行掩埋。此一事實，假如僅從「懲治貪汚」一點上着目，自然是可以令人爲之拍掌高呌「痛快：」但，假如我們更進而從「法治」的見地着目，則王縣長此種「發明，」不僅是有點「違法，」而且似乎是故意拿人命開頑笑。</p>
<p>本來，在中國，所設「官箴·」也眞是如阿Ｑ所說：「太媽媽的了」！「建設廉潔政治」儘管呌得震天價響，而「賄賂公行」的事實，却依然是舉目皆是。只要有「賄」，便可以賣官，可以賣法，可以賣人情，這樣的買賣行爲，差不多支配了中國整個的政治。「賄」的進一步便是「敲，」敲骨吸髓的事實也是舉目皆是在「賄」與「敲」之下，便沒有了「法，」沒有了「政，」有的只是金銀的氣息，只是惡魔的面目和鬼蜮的技倆。假如這世間能有一個大坑，把種種賄的行爲都一坑埋盡，把「法」和「政」從金銀堆裏救出來，自然是一椿大快事。</p>
<p>但，世間究竟不會有這樣一個大坑，而且「賄」也不僅是一個簡單的「道德問題，」它與社會經濟制度是息息相聯，也决不是一個坑所能埋盡。再退一步說，懲治貪汚，也儘有「國法」在，該監禁，便監禁，該殺頭，便殺頭，不根據國法去處置，却掘下一個坑，令其自投入坑，而且須自行掩埋，痛快則痛快矣，但「法治」之謂何？我們只要一閉目默想這自投坑自理葬的慘劇，舌頭便不自禁的會一伸，這不是王縣長故意拿人命開頑笑是什麽？貪汚固然是可殺，拿人命開頑笑難道便可恕嗎？</p>
<p>然而在目前，這樣矯枉過正」開頑笑的行爲儘多着，只要你高興，便隨時可以來一個發明，隨時可以開個頑笑，有誰過問呢？</p>
<h3 id="c267">中國人和日本人 <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 高明</p>
<p>那是今年三月四日的事。這時候，中國和日本差了多已經停戰，我們的十九路軍已經退到常熟一類的地方去了。到三月四日這一天晚上，忽然來了一個消息，說我軍已經反攻過來，並且日本的主將白川已經被打死了。這時候，我們一些老百姓的高興，是不能形容的。每一家人家都放鞭砲，一些人都跑到街上去歡呼，有些甚至坐着汽車或電車敲鼓鳴鑼。鞭砲的紙頭將馬路鋪高了一兩寸，街上被人羣Literally地擠得水洩不通了。一些人都歡呼：</p>
<p>「白川死了！白川死了！」</p>
<p>即使那些摩登女郎一個人在街上走着，也都含着笑。爲什麽，是因爲白川死了。</p>
<p>中國人是，如此，缺乏「費厄潑賴」（Fart-play）的精神的。</p>
<p>讀日本新潮雜誌十二月號，裏面有一篇近松秋江的門外漢的新聞觀，中間有這樣一段記載：</p>
<p>「八月初，我從東京到日光去。到日光，已經是晚上了。這鄕下地方的人，排着隊·提着燈，在街上游行着。我問他們什麽事，他們說因爲馬占山戰死了，所以提燈慶祝的。我不禁微笑了。」</p>
<p>因此我們知道，並且「放心」了，我們的「文明國民」日本人，也同樣缺乏着「費厄潑賴」的精神。</p>
<p>在這個年頭兒講什麽「費厄潑賴」，也許是落伍的，至少·也帶着點唐克孝（DonQuixote）氣吧。但是不知怎麽，這個總覺得是可愛的。</p>
<h3 id="c268">面壁綺語 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 葉靈鳳</p>
<p>月當頭</p>
<p>走進了許久沒有走進的藏書室，一種陰森的沉滯的空氣，使我心上突然湧起了凄凉的哀思，覺得自己好像走進了自己的墳墓，往昔的悲歡如今竟靜靜的蒙鏖在無情的歲月中了。</p>
<p>十年浪跡·殘照空華，歷盡了少年人所顚倒的幻夢·在一切都消逝了以後，祇有這半壁殘書，還给我留下了不易銷磨的痕迹。對着這架上的每一册書，我都能幻想出一個落漠的靈魂，在冷靜遺忘之中，守護着他自己的寳藏。</p>
<p>抽下一册七年前流行一時的英國小說，吹去頂上沉睡着的灰塵·揭開第一頁·在黃舊了的紙上我看見幾行這樣黯淡的鉛筆字跡：</p>
<p>「月當頭夜催歸去，碧海靑天共杳冥：十年湖海感愁多，又向天南喚奈何」。</p>
<p>七年前，一個初寒的晚上，圍着絳紅的爐火·嫁期已定了的麗，從我手中拿去了正在讀着的這册書，在空頁上留下了這樣的幾句。她默然遞給了我，我看了一眼，隨即悄然掩上了書，蹲下去撥弄爐灰。年少的心，那時已經知道珍重自己的哀愁，不願輕易的施捨了。</p>
<p>踏月歸來，逆了輕寒，我咀嚼着這蕩漾在心頭的奈何的滋味，始終沒有勇氣能再揭開那一册未完的書。歲月易逝，悄悄的已經飛走了七年。在這七年之中，我不曾有機會再見過她一眼，祇是間接的聽見人言，如今已是綠葉成陰，兒女成行了。賢淑的心，想早已拂去了那偶然的聚散。</p>
<p>對着這黯淡的字跡，捧了書，我面壁悄立。從淡漠之中，我重行被牽入了自己所織下的羅網。十二月十五。</p>
<h3 id="c269">澳洲土人之奇聞 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>澳洲，地居南洋羣島西南，是英國領的大陸。這裏的土人，是未開化的人種，各分部落，有一個頭目，以絕對權力，支配着各部落的人民。頭目有時候是世襲：而通常以珍奇的天然物爲禮物，即可收買頭目的位置。土人之間，有一種稱爲醫生的人，這種人旣做各種族的司祭，也幹魔術師般的事，有時候幷且隨隨便便憑自己的意思替人治病，所以的確可以算是有用的大夫。這種醫生所用的方法，大半是神秘主義的：他們借夢和幻像預斷某種前兆。這在我們看來，雖完全是架空的想像，但是他們却相信是一種使用魔力的玩藝。</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>部落中生了小孩的時候，馬上就替他算上一命，看可以使他活着不可：而頭生子大半總是殺死的。還有，倘若前一個小孩還沒有斷奶，那末後生的小孩大半是殺死的。（實際講來，這種孩子也難於養大成人。）據澳洲政府的統計，新生的小孩被這樣糊裏糊塗弄死的，有三分之一至二分之一之數，而一些土人所以肯做這樣的犧牲，乃因他們相信那被弄死的孩子到下一次生出的時候，是重新可以變成人的。</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>至於被容許生存的孩子，却非常被鍾愛。母親常給他喝奶一直到兩三歲；父親每天哄着他。等到孩子大了，父母便用種種方法使他高興。所以澳洲土人的幼年時代，乃是他們最幸福的時代。到九歲十歲的時候，這幸福的時代也就告終；女孩子則以一種簡單的儀式，一躍而爲成年的女人，男孩子則以比較複雜的儀式，一躍而爲成年的男子。這種儀式，是因種族而異的：其中最簡單的，乃是庫爾乃族。</p>

<h3 id="c270">宮女與妓女 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 施蟄存</p>
<p>偶然看見『藝術旬刋』第七期中複印着一頁法國大雕刻家羅丹的作品，底下譯了一個中文題名，呌做『美麗的老宮女』。不覺拍案驚奇起來。我記得羅丹並沒有替什麽宮女做過雕像。這複印着的雕像，我倒是早巳認識了的，牠是羅丹的傑作，題名呌做『美麗的Heaulmiere』。羅丹造此奇醜的雕像，完全取材於古法國詩人維龍的一首詩『美麗的Heaulmiere的怨詞』。不錯，在藝術旬刋上復印的雕像下還注着一行『參看第五期譯詩』，於是我就去把第五期藝術旬刋找來，在第七頁上發見了一首維龍詩的漢譯。可是題目還是『美麗的老宮女』。</p>
<p>話說Heaulmiere這個字是從Heaulme這字上來的。Heaulme是古代的一種頭盔，Heaulmere誼作頭盔匠！Ieaulmiere則是頭盔匠太太的意思了。這美麗的頭盔匠太太是一個妓女，這是法國古典文學『玫瑰傳奇』中的一個人物。詩人維龍慨嘆着靑春不再，美艷無常，於是設想這曾經以艷色聞於天下的女子，在她丈夫死了三十年之後，怨掉着自己底色衰艷褪，衍爲極凄厲的歌詞。</p>
<p>這首詩第一節的大意是『我想我聽見了那從前做過頭盔匠太太的美女，她在婉惜着她的靑春，啊！老年·殘忍的老年，爲什麽這樣快的把我的容顏摧毀？還有什麽留戀，使我還不想自盡。』唱到這裏，那老年的美女就自己顧盼她底皺縮的肌膚，枯乾的手臂，不禁回想起當年的雪膚花貌。於是第二節以後的大意便是『啊，他已經死了三十餘年，現在祇遺剩着我，一個蒼老的婦人。我想想從前的好日子；那時我又何等美艷。現在我怎樣了，當我看了自己的裸體，樣子瘦得多了，枯萎，衰弱而顫縮，我眞憤恨欲狂了。我的柔，滑的額角到那裏去了？我底金髮妙目到那裏去了？我底適中的鼻頭到那裏去了？我底小耳朶，我底嬌　，我底朱唇都到那裏去了？』以下就是兩節竭力描寫一個衰老的妓女的詩句，依着次序詠嘆下去，肩膀，手臂，眉額，眼睛，鼻子，股肢，乳房都是淸瘦，乾　，枯燥，萎縮，呆滯得不成樣子了。『這就是人類的美艷底結局！』在最後一節裏，詩人寫了這樣的警句。</p>
<p>雕刻家羅丹就是特意應用了這首詩中所描寫的樣子作爲藍本，而創造了他底名作。我們自然應當一面讀維龍的詩，一面再仔細看羅丹的雕刻。就容易體會出這兩種藝術的表現法之長處來了。可惜藝術旬刋中沒有將原詩全譯，而在中國又看不到羅丹作品的實體。這不免是一些缺點。至於把兩個題目都譯作宮女，那就是牛頭不對馬嘴了。</p>

<p>他正在喝牛奶·看見鶴子夫人也端着一盅牛乳，咬着一片麫包，滿臉笑容的走上來。</p>
<p>『林先生，麫包少了點麽？』</p>
<p>『不。』</p>
<p>『林先生一個人吃早點，不高興吧。所以我上來陪你一同吃。可以？』</p>
<p>他略歪了歪頭，笑着說。</p>
<p>『你有客，你下去陪他們好了。』</p>
<p>海泉還想多說一二句更露骨些的話譏刺她一下。不過一時想不出來。有的又太過刻薄了一點，怕引起了她的生氣。</p>
<p>『牛奶夠喝嗎？』</p>
<p>『我這裏還有多呢。』</p>
<p>『有多？讓給我喝吧？』</p>
<p>『不是拿去喝嗎？』</p>
<p>鶴子夫人眞的走過去拿起他的牛奶盅子來喝了兩口，又擱回去了。</p>
<p>『林先生，怎麽今天一點笑容也沒有？我要看你笑了才下去。』</p>
<p>給她這末一說，他禁不住笑了。</p>
<p>『請你喝　完那盅牛奶吧。』</p>
<p>『不。』</p>
<p>『眞是有趣的小孩子！林先生，今天放學後，要早點來，免得我望你。不要像昨夜那樣的遲。』</p>
<p>她一邊說，一邊下樓去了。看見她走了後，海泉又像掉了一件東西般的。</p>
<p>他掩早了自己的房門，挾着書包，正待下樓去時，忽然看見娘姨送了一張請帖上來。他接過來一看，是；</p>
<p>十二月五日下午五時謹治蔬酌</p>
<p>光</p>
<p>任錦華　劉佩珍謹訂</p>
<p>席設本宅霞飛路Ｈ坊四十五號</p>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>海泉拿着請帖看了又看，好似想從這張請帖裏，發見一些可以作向鶴子夫人報復的手段，又像想從這張請帖裏面尋覓啦啦隊，丨丨因爲他覺得自己像上了臺了，不久就要動手和那個穿着日本和服的東洋人角力了。丨丨做他的後援。</p>
<p>『這張請帖帶着走呢，還是把它留在家裏？』</p>
<p>他爲這個問題又大費躊躇了一會。同時他希望看鶴子夫人會從樓上走下來，好把這張請帖交給她看看，聊作一個示威運動。但是他等了一忽，仍不見鶴子夫人下來，看見上課的時間又快到了，他便把那張請帖交給了娘姨。</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>吾並不絕對反對繁榮都市，吾只覺得鄕村也不可忘掉，中國以農立國，自古對於工商業塲所的都市，不大注意，以致歷代盛行赶場，以一定的時間，會集商品於某一適中地點，做做買賣，據吳市長說，中國之有市政，始自廣州，時在民國十年二月十五日，廣東省政府公布廣州市暫行條例，劃爲市行政區，亦可見吾國注意於都市之繁榮與設施，爲時尙暫，良可嘅已。</p>
<p>近來國人都很注意都市的繁榮了，早幾天看了吳市長的大上海演講詞，使吾發生濃厚的幻想，昨又見報載北平市政府擬具繁榮平市計劃，並已將計劃書呈請中央鑒定，其大綱分社會，公安，財產等九項，廣東省政府也擬有繁榮廣州市區新計劃，劃定大沙頭爲發展商業區，說欲求繁榮，須先設備娛樂場，欲求娛樂塲發達，須先將烟室，賭館，娼寮，勒令遷入，違者加課重稅，據說是寓禁於征的絕妙辦法，更使吾看了發生懿歟盛哉的感歎。</p>
<p>站在繁榮都市的立塲上說，大上海計劃及繁榮平市計劃，吾都表示贊同，惟廣東那樣的繁榮市區計劃，實無異公開提倡要人民學習抽烟賭博嫖娼，吾只有拭目以看將來，一時還未敢貿然同意。</p>
<p>惟吾尙有進一層的意思要說，即是吾們不要爲了繁榮都市，便完全把鄕村忘掉！吾固知道中國的都市，還比不上歐美的那麽繁榮，小的不說，就算頂乖乖的上海，北平，廣州，也還在在有愧色，誠然需要趕快繁榮，但須知道都市不過是鄕村的縮影。丨丨鄕村農產品的集中及經濟的總匯點，尋根究柢，尤應從鄕村繁榮始，吾國擁有地廣人稀，溫和氣候的天然環境，自昔即負農產國盛名，米，茶，絲，及其他產品生產，不但供己用之有餘，而且還有大批運售外洋，茶，絲，瓷器，歷握世界牛耳，糧食中如東北之豆類，亦向有大宗輸出，富裕國民經濟不鮮，</p>
<p>現在呢，茶葉弄得洋人不敢承受，幾乎外銷絕跡了，蠶絲權坐讓奴國奪佔，江西的瓷器，也沒多少外銷了，所最痛心者，糧食竟佔了輸入品中的首席地位，唉，以農立國，此何可堪。</p>
<p>鄕村之如此破產，其原因固然很多，政治不上軌道，國際資本主義勢力潛入農村，兵匪横行，天災薦臻，都是主要的原因，然一般人只管朝向都市跑，政府當軸祇顧及都市的繁榮，以致形成本末混亂，社會日益貧窮化的恐慌現象，總算也是鄕村破產的一個最大　結吧！所以吾看了上海，北平，廣州，三大都市的繁榮計劃，不由得略有感想，而今吾要呐喊一聲。</p>

<h3 id="c273">藍晒圖紙之製法 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 爾明</p>
<p>近年工程建築日新月盛，於是繪圖計劃之術亦與之俱盛，每一工程，需圖少者數份，多者數十百份，每份自數張至數十張，抄畫則勢所不能，石印則耗費不資，於是乎藍晒圖紙爲今工程建築上之必要品，此外如各大學工科實業學校以及鐵路局水利局等，又如印照相罔不借重此紙，但此晒圖之紙，製造非難，今述之於下，</p>
<p>製藍晒圖紙之溶液製此紙須二種溶液混合而成，㈠正鐵靑酸鉀溶液SolutionofFerricynideofpotassium即赤色靑酸鉀深液SolutionofredPrussiateofpotash錏檸檬酸鐵溶液SolutionofAmmoniocitraceofiron即亞莫尼亞與鐵之檸檬酸化物之深液SolutionofoitrateofironandAmmonia</p>
<p>此二種鹽類深液平常製法先分溶而後和合之，第一種藥品須研爲細末，第二種藥品常爲純體，深解極易，全　時可成固體，然遇濕即溶，經數日即軟化不合用：故此藥品須視所用多寡而定製造之分量，（須在暗室内製）</p>
<p>溶解配合之分量，配合之法不一，其最適且之分量如下，</p>
<p>第一溶液赤色靑酸鉀一盎斯（合庫平七，六一錢，水六盎斯或赤色靑酸鉀二盎斯半，水一品脫，（合○，六一升約重一二，六七兩），此液俟完全溶解後濾之（以經過生棉爲速）</p>
<p>第二溶液錏檸檬酸鐵一盎斯半，水六盎斯或　檸檬酸鐵四盎斯，水一品脫，此液俟完全溶和後亦須瀘至極淸爲止，第一第二兩種溶液須分盛於有玻璃塞之玻璃瓶中，而置於暗室以待應用，用時應二液以等分和合，再行濾凈，愼防赤色靑酸鉀之末遺於液中，倘此混和之液由棕色而變爲淺藍綠色，則不可用矣，此種混合溶液每四盎斯可製紙一百平方英尺之面積，價僅値洋一二角而已，</p>
<p>製藍晒圖紙用之紙料尋常所用之紙，堅靱耐洗者已足，若晒印精圖須紙質細緻而堅靱，平滑而調匀，且溶液不能滲透紙背者爲宜，否則液透紙内生化學作用，雖經水洗而圖不顯矣，德國之塞克斯紙Saxe及法國之利維司紙Rives爲製此種紙之佳品，其他惠司東Weston's及蘇格蘭Seoteh之亞麻絲紙質最緊亦爲上品，以上諸紙皆須仰給外國，而吾國無有，實一恨事，然吾國倣造之紙有堅靱平滑者，儘可試製少許，倘得良果，則可取以爲代，</p>
<p>溶液染紙之順序溶液染紙須在暗室中爲之，所謂暗室者非全暗不見物，亦須略透微光或嵌紅玻璃一方於壁以透光，溶液祇須渲染紙之一面，塗染之法有二種，分述於下，</p>
<p>㈠浮染法·溶液盛於平底大淺盆内，將紙浮於液面，紙之正面觸溶液，浮紙時以兩手撮紙之二對角，使餘二對角接觸液面，所撮二對角先下其一，後下其他，俟全紙觸液之後，將紙之一半翻上察其有無氣泡，如有則將紙重觸液面，左右拖動，其無氣泡之一半可翻起不必觸液，全紙浮觸液面約經一二分鐘即可取出，懸於水盆之旁，使遺液乾去，此法之結果良　，全視手術之巧拙，染紙所用之淺方盆須大於所染之紙，其四圍須留移動之餘地盆之内面非但不可漏水，並須不受化學之作用方佳，</p>
<p>㈡染刷法，平舖紙於平板上紙與板之間，襯以軟滑油布，以寛廣之軟刷蘸液匀刷紙面，重複二三次即成，此法</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>最簡，惟須敏捷行之，倘一方未染一方已乾，則此紙無用矣，如染長大之紙，須以二人爲之，先用濕刷迅速將紙渲染一次，隨即用輕刷横刷紙面，擠去濕水，然後將液染上則溶深匀敷，渲染迅速可得善果，渲染旣畢將紙之一邊夾附横竿上，懸諸暗室内以待乾燥，</p>
<p>藍晒圖紙之保存，紙製成之後須善藏於黑暗乾燥之所·小者平置木匣或紙匣内，長大者捲藏於紙筒鉛筒等物之内，蓋而封之可歷久不壤，製成之紙千萬不可摺疊，一經摺疊紙面不平不能用矣，</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3 id="c275">解决讀書問題的建議 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我不是一個店員，對於店員的生活並不十分淸楚。最近看過了你們的店員通訊，引起了我對於店員所受痛苦的同情。</p>
<p>今天（十二月十四）你提出了四個問題，要大家發表意見；我是一個敎書匠，就來談第二個問題罷。</p>
<p>『店員·學徒或練習生等，如何可以滿足求知的慾望』呢！</p>
<p>我想：對於這個問題，如果採用下述的方法，一定可得到目前的相當的解决。什麽方法呢？</p>
<p>『由有志上進的店員學徒和練習生等組織店員讀書會。由讀書會創設巡廻圖書館。』</p>
<p>現在讓我來說明爲什麽要用這個方法：</p>
<p>第一，因爲店員們每日的讀書時間很少：要減少借還書籍所估去的跑路時間，只有創設巡迴圖書館。</p>
<p>第二，因爲上海目前已有的圖書館，那裏面所備的書籍不是專爲店員們設備的，也不是由店員們的實在需要才設備的。</p>
<p>那其中合於店員們實在需要的，又苦於册數太少，不便周轉。因此，店員們最好是創設自己實在需要的巡迴圖書館。</p>
<p>第三，要創設巡迴圖書館，非錢不行。但是，這件事由一個人做，自然難辦：由多數人做，便是一件容易的事了。所以，要先由店員們組織讀書會，然後再設圖書館。</p>
<p>這以上是我一時想到的結果，想的自然不能周到。比方，下列的幾個問題，便沒有相當的解决；</p>
<p>㈠店員們讀書的時間由怎樣的方法去取得？</p>
<p>㈡讀書會内部的組織怎樣？</p>
<p>㈢圖書館内部的組織怎樣？</p>
<p>不過，我以爲對於這些問題，暫時不要去過細討論牠。現在最要緊的事就是：</p>
<p>『只要有二三人便組織起來！』</p>
<p>因爲要組織了以後才會產生合於公意的辦法呵！要公共承認的才是可能的辦法呵！</p>
<p>編者先生！你以爲怎樣？</p>
<p>店員學徒或練習生們！你們以爲怎樣？</p>
<p>張建華十二月十四日</p>
<p>編者按：張君以爲欲滿足店員們的求知慾望，有創立巡迴圖書館的必要。這個問題，正是我們時刻罣念而且已經獲得滿意的解决了的</p>
<p>本報爲紀念創刋六十周年，特創設流通圖書館於交通便利商業中心的南京路大陸商塲三樓三四五號，專以補助工商業敎育爲主旨，所以，張君所提出的三個問題，均已迎刃而解了。</p>
<p>㈠該館訂有送閱辦法：僱人將書籍直接送至各借閱者處所，不取分文，店員們儘可終日的坐在店裏，亦得充份的借閱機會。</p>
<p>㈡該館於開幕之始，就在本報封面登出啓事：歡迎讀者將平素極愛好之書籍名稱及出版處所，隨時函知，以便添購。俾可符合該館所置的圖書，均能適合店員需要的宗旨。</p>
<p>㈢經濟一項·完全由本報負責，當然更無問題了。</p>
<p>至關於店員讀書會的問題，最好由店員自身起來設法解决，我們很願意竭力贊助，而况此種會的組織範圍，我們是很贊成張君的建議，人數不必多，三四人即可組織起來，（事實上人數亦不宜多。）似乎尙不是一件辦不到的事，我們很願意早日聽見讀者中有這種組織的消息，解决我們智識饑荒的煩悶。</p>

<p>大約在星期一那天的早晨，紀念週完畢了，繼着就是那吵鬧不堪的國文課了。</p>
<p>不多時那上課鐘噹噹的響了，在五分鐘之後，敎室外的學生，始慢慢地的一個一個　進那沉悶的敎室。忽然敎室外咯咯咯皮鞋聲響，已達到我們的敎室裏來了，抬起頭來一看，「哈」！敎室裏的同學都不約而同的喊出來，連得近視眼的學生亦趕緊的拿出眼睛來架在鼻上看一個究竟。</p>
<p>原來那平日素愛樸實的國文敎員，今天大翻其行頭了。頭上戴的是紅結瓜皮小帽，身上着的是綠色綢的棉袍，外面外加罩上大花緞的馬掛，鄕下帶出來的布底鞋子，亦不着了，却居然着其咯咯咯　着的革履，看這雙半新舊的皮鞋，他從未穿過，大約是從上海嚇嚇有名的舊貨商塲裏淘來的罷，於是學生之中，有以玩皮出名的綽號呌小活狲，因爲鑒於今天國文敎員的一副鄕下摩登化樣子，於是題給他一個雅號呌做「小堂名」全堂又哄然大笑。</p>
<p>那敎員在學生大笑胡鬧之中，翻開了閻王簿，開始點名，費盡了幼時吃乳的氣力，才把這四十多個名字一齊點完，結果，個個多到·連得那好久不曾起牀的生病學生，今天亦到在裏面了。那敎員不管三七二十一的翻開敎本，開始講解那上次未曾講完的一張，在這素來厭惡的國文課，那一個肯聽呢，於是有拿着筆俯首正在寫情書的，有弄看愛人照片的·亦有提着筆添飽了墨在報紙上大發牢騷的，在這一課之中，正是無奇不有了。</p>
<p>那所稱小堂名的敎員，講解得津津有味，搖頭擺尾的大發其批評議論，後來實在吵得不成樣子了，弄得「小堂名」敎員直跳起來，把頭上戴的紅結小帽·向講台上一放，這一放又引起全級的同學狂聲大笑，正在這不上不下的時候，忽然那救命鐘噹噹的響了，於是那敎員高呌着道「這次饒你們，下次决不可這樣」立刻戴上帽子，挾了書本，一溜大吉了，於是學生都很整齊的高喊着「一···二···三，小堂名···」</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>就爲看這一番處置，躭擱了時候，使我雖然搭了夜車，竟已無臥車可臥；沒奈何祇得把我這勉强從病榻上扶起來的病軀，巓巍地裝進了尋常的頭等車廂裏去，却不料幸而這麽一差失，倒使我在抛棄了一切的一切之後·又逢到了一椿出乎意外的奇遇。</p>
<p>美麗的小猪玀！你道是怎樣的一椿奇遇啊？難道除你这外，還有値得我詫爲奇遇的人嗎？不！不！這祇是太凑巧，所以使我詫爲奇遇了。</p>
<p>在踏進車廂的當兒，我像犯了虚心病一樣的很急促地望一個單人座上坐了下去，立刻把我的腦袋藏在提高了的大衣領裏，貼往了一個壁角蜷伏着：在我四周坐的是些怎樣的人物，是男，是女，是老，是少，我都不曾分辨淸楚，祇覺得他們全是人而已。</p>
<p>「噲！密司忒朱！車子開了三四分鐘，突然有一條很淸脆，而又很熟的喉嚨，在我的貼對面，極流利的顚動着：同時又有五支很纖細的手指，極大膽地把掩住着我的面龐的大衣領，拉了開來。</p>
<p>這一個極普通的小動作對於我，却發生了像逢到了某種大變故一般的大驚嚇，險些打座位上跳了起來；眸子像着了惱一般的瞪得又圓又大，可是在我面前祇隔兩尺路近的人影，還是覺得很模糊。</p>
<p>唉，親愛的小兄弟，老實告訴你：我那時候的病態·要如給一個膽小的朋友瞧見了，說不定他就立刻會把我送上萬國殯儀館去。</p>
<p>「噲！密司忒朱！你病着嗎」？坐在我對面的座位上，首先和我招呼的那個人，也馬上發現我是病了。</p>
<p>他雖然已兩次的用一種美國紳士的口氣，把密司脫三個字連着我的尊姓，很淸切地喊着，但是我還想不起他是那一位至親好友，不過我已經認淸楚她是她，而不是他了。</p>
<p>感謝得很丨後面不知道有那位富於勇氣的人，竟不顧公意的打開了一扇玻璃窗，讓尖利而猛烈的夜風，前仆後繼地撲進車廂裏來。我恰巧適當其衝，風就在我的後頸裏團團地盤旋着：不消多少時候，早已毛骨悚然，頭目一淸了。、眼前立即就現出了一位極度摩登化，以致於使别人無從分辨她究竟是娼妓，還是良家婦女的密司來。紅的胭脂·白的粉，靑的黛，已聯合着戰綫，掩過了她的眞面目；一襲杏黃色的綢質的旗袍，，緊得像跟肉生成一片，無一處不盡量的顯露出她的曲線美來；背後還搭着一件並非實用，專爲裝飾的外國花呢製的春大衣。</p>
<p>畢竟她是誰呢？這一個人，不但是你所永遠不會猜得到的；就是我，在最初的五分鐘，也險些認爲不是眞景。因爲她來得委實太出人意外了！</p>
<p>别急，親愛的小兄弟，待我告訴了你吧！她不是别人，便是你們那一位周大律師的舊情人丨丨李芳女士。你道可不奇怪嗎？</p>
<p>更奇怪的是：我們這一位貴同學，自從離開學校，極忍心地抛棄了大經之後，我雖然曾有一種幼稚得可笑的意識，想找到了她，極痛快地嘲駡她一番，但是，竟始終不曾碰見過，誰料到在這最後的關頭，却像鬼使神差似的劈面相</p>

<p>如果一個人，給你這樣的一個劇本：說有一個暴發的靑年，開了一家賣「私酒」的舞塲，他認識了一位女郎，丨這女郎就是這大酒店的房子的舊主人，丨在這朝朝飲宴夜夜笙歌的環境中，他們兩人都棄了舊歡，互相戀愛了，得意之餘，酒店却被流氓所搗毀，丨本事就完在這裏了，</p>
<p>當然你知道，那靑年是要有男性的一切優美；又要威儀華貴；又要活潑矯健，女郎是要在容貌以外，含有神秘性，和熱烈的“Jt”，表演和人選，都是困難極了，而又限于這樣的劇情，却要導演成一部緊張而帶詼諧的愛情喜劇，</p>
<p>你以爲這是極難的事，甚至于不可解的，但是派拉蒙公司辦到了，而且有完滿的成績，你不信嗎？光陸昨天起演的「夜夜元宵」NigbtAfterNight，就是如我以上所說的一張片子，</p>
<p>導演利用巧妙的手腕和鏡頭，從極平淡的述事，一步一步往前走，不知不覺的引人入勝，光陸只可算不錯，因爲八千尺片中，根本就論怎樣離開這酒店，　　那最難的男主角，是號稱范倫鐵諾第二的喬治賴夫GeorgeRaft，他很合我上面所說的條件，我覺得他一切，都反有些像雷門諾伐羅，成績是很好，飾一個被女性包圍的男子「適如其人」，女郎是康司登肯明ConstanceCummings，我不記得她在什麽片子中主演過；不過我相信，她不是初上鏡頭的明星，因爲沒一個人能一入銀幕，就這樣老練的，其餘演員不錯的太多了，恕不能一個個的寫出來，</p>
<p>好處是片的組織，我已經說過，了，剪接上極精致，同時佈景是値得一說的，牠並不是標奇立異的偉大，牠只是平常極華麗的，不過已是窮奢極；助以貴族派的表演，更增加了無窮富麗堂皇的色彩，呌人有美感，牠的「小趣」詼諧丨，是沒一個地方，沒有的，不過許多是隱藏在對白中，不懂英文的人，就會吃虧，丨丢了許多可笑的機會，</p>
<p>劇義可以分兩點；第一，　述到美國禁酒會的施弛，和現代美國賣酒的充斥，人民的嗜好，與當初定法之志，所得効果，正相反，第二，是說近年來人對于「金錢」「愛情」的熊度，是决對與已往的不同，更證明了世風的改進丨丨日上還是日下？只好各人自已去想，</p>
<p>也許我說牠過份了吧：當然我不敢一定說牠怎麽特别好；不過决不能說不好，丨特别牠是在難能的條件下，產生出來，所以是可貴了，</p>

<p>— 雲</p>
<p>荷蘭的兒童是沒有我國兒童這般幸運的。因爲那裏的電影院，好像是成年人的消遣地，普通的影片，是絕對禁止十八歲以下的兒童去參觀的。但是，這是他們政府的定例，並不是像上海的一般電影院，利用禁止兒童參觀來做廣告的。有時荷蘭電影院遇到特准兒童參觀的影片時，電影院便大登廣告，兒童們全都非常高興，因爲他們看電影的次數太少了，每年祇有三四次啊！</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3 id="c283">閻將軍的苦茶（下） <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>晴天霹靂·因瑪麗的通敵，敵軍前綫突轉優勢，並且巨額公穀，都被他們搶去。閻將軍在軍事上經濟上因此也都發現了困難，兵無鬭志，主力軍隊就紛紛潰退。</p>
<p>閻將軍失敗了。Megau要和他同走，但他呌她先走，因爲他即使給他的敵人捉住，她却可以安然地逃去。</p>
<p>臨别了！Megan到了板船裏，閻將軍却呆立在岸旁，手裏執着槍，揮手呌水手開船。四週叛兵的呼聲漸近，Megan嚇得差不多有些瘋了。</p>
<p>閻將軍犧牲了自己的生命，救出了一個他敬愛的異國女友。</p>
<p>這樣，内亂的領袖們可以放心了，因爲這張片子幷沒有把他們的個性發揮出來，反將他們說得好像一位溫柔，多情的英雄。</p>
<p>致於内戰，當然有確切的描寫，烽火，慘呼和避難，但這些一切的一切，都是中國特有的產品，我們是司空見慣的。况且有這樣多情的將軍，也許可以校正外人對於我國軍閥酷厲的印像。其餘幾幕富有詩意的月夜，和英雄美人的喁喁情話，更是耐人尋味。</p>
<p>缺點當然也有，像閻將軍在家裏時，穿着龍袍一般的外衣，瑪麗的衣飾，完全不合中國今日的摩登女子，此外外觀如菜餙一般的衙門，和在各内戰從沒有用過的飛機大轟炸等等，都未免有失實或畫蛇添足之譏。最可惜的，他們對於瑪麗·角，不用旅美的中國女星，如黃柳霜或楊愛立扮演，而由日本東京人櫻花女郎ToshiMori担任，她對於中國毫無認識，以致完全不合身份，全片爲之遜色。</p>
<p>末了，我祈懇電影檢查會，不要不准這張佳片在中國開映，使我們大家一廣眼福，看看這多情的閻將軍，即使不然，我們也可以看看美國人對於中國的印像，到底進步了些沒有。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c284">「空門紅淚」 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 顧燕</p>
<p>這是一部天一無聲時代的佳作，我總沒想到牠，這時候才放映</p>
<p>劇情</p>
<p>以一個被壓迫而無抵抗力的女子，遭受黑暗社會的逼迫，而遁跡空門，把一生的幸福，輕輕易易地斷送在尼庵之中。在時代上說：這是一部過代作品，但是在劇中人秀華的意誠中，因爲她的處境與敎育，自然想不出再好的寄托，現代的女人沒有不認爲她的思想是落伍的，除了這一小點以外，綜合起全劇的情節來雖不是十分的好，可是在天一無聲時代的作品，巳經算是佳製了。因爲牠是去年春季的出品啊。</p>
<p>導演</p>
<p>有許多是思想，可是抄襲外國影片的地方也很多，不過運用的都不免强。似乎陳玉梅在被車撞傷的一塲鏡頭裏，躺得太不自然了，不像是撞倒而躺下的，這是一些粗心。孫敏和陳玉梅由醫院回去的時候，看上去似乎已經回家，很久的樣子，因爲孫敏改了靑色西裝，而玉梅的小辮子，又變成了扇髪結，這是疏忽的一小點。餘如蕭正中馬東武隔一鏡頭髮已花白等塲面，都欠交代仔細。</p>
<p>表演</p>
<p>陳玉梅在前半部很平常後半部很細膩。舒麗娟表演兇婦人，本來是拿手，這一片裏做得比「小女伶」裏爽快。孫敏精彩地方一點也找不出，可是很穩重，張振鐸秦哈哈太愛做戲，所以免不了文明戲「挿臘燭」的毛病，葛福的表演最適合身份，蔣耐芳許靜貞都能按個性去做戲，馬東武蕭正中無甚大疵，可是男扮女有點肉麻丨</p>
<p>化裝</p>
<p>陳玉梅最好，能把時代分淸，馬東，武的面部也很自然，</p>
<p>攝影</p>
<p>技巧還不錯，「變化」及「拚印」很捷凈，可惜光線太强硬，反光奪目，殊使人厭。</p>
<h3 id="c285">佈景　　尼庵和小街景，這兩場很逼眞，尤其是一場大風雪的道路僻巷，佈置得很完美，餘多平常。結論　　綜合以上的諸點，不能說不是天一有進步的作品，疵點是無論那部作品中都免不了的，可是希望天一的人們盡量的努力。陳玉梅的小名  雲　　天一的陳玉梅，小名呌「寳寳」。她初入電影界時，在張伯仁先生創辦的東方影片公司做演員，那時她呌「陳麟鳳」。後來被天一公司總理邵醉翁賞識，加入天一公司，就改名呌「玉梅」。經邵先生竭力提拔，現在已經是天一公司的台柱了。電影專著「假戲眞做」  陳大悲　　我在前面早已說過，我們中國人因爲血統複雜的緣故，模倣的能力，比起單純血統的民族來，便天然的强得多。所以在表演藝術上我們應當有最大的貢獻。但是事實恰巧相反。這是甚麽緣故呢？　　依我說，這是因爲我們不善　於實行『假戲眞做』這四個字。　　歐美人勝過我們頂顯著的地方就是他們的善　於『假戲眞做』。不但舞台上和銀幕上如此。就連在日常生活中，他們都能夠把每一齣明知其假的戲做得活龍活現的像眞的一樣。住在上海的人祇要看一看外國人送殯，然後再去看一看中國人送殯，就能夠明白了。你看他們送殯的親友們差不多每人臉上都能夠充分表現出一種悲哀的神氣來。我們中國送殯的親友手裏拿着一炷香，嘴裏不是咬着　一紙烟，便是嘰哩的咕嚕和同伴們談笑風生，幾幾乎忘記了跑在路上所爲何事。再拿人家禮拜堂裏嚴肅的空氣和我們大街巷裏放熖口的僧道們一雙雙骨溜溜四面轉的眼光比一比。諸如此類，不論跑進那一界中你都可以尋出一些我國人不善　於『假戲眞做』的證據來。　　歐美人的表演藝術爲甚麽能這樣的發達？就因爲他們離開舞台，無處沒有練習『假戲眞做』的機會，因爲他們在社交中無往而不大演其戲。 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>

<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaoshu and eight other committee members proposed a plan for troop reduction: (1) Based on the current number of troops, reduce each army by one-quarter.

<h3 id="e14">Main Points of Wu Chaoshu's Anti-Japanese Proposal <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations is No Longer Able to Uphold Justice</p>
<p>Should Fully Develop the Power of Self-Reliance</p>
<p>Aid the Volunteer Armies and Boycott Japanese Goods</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Chaoshu and others proposed an anti-Japanese plan, the main points of which state that the League of Nations is no longer able to uphold justice or create an effective plan to restrain Japan. The United States cannot do what it wants due to the change of president, and the powers are each deciding their approach to the Far East based on their own interests, merely sitting and watching the situation change by itself. Even though the powers are unwilling to help us, we should also contact them to avoid being used by the enemy. We should fully develop the power of self-reliance. The Shanghai War is the most obvious example. The activities of the Northeast volunteer armies are making the Japanese exhausted and realize the difficulty of annexing the Northeast, and making the Japanese military leaders realize that the government should seek good policies for the volunteer armies in the face of all difficulties. As for boycotting goods, it is deeply feared by the Japanese. It is said that aiding the volunteer armies and boycotting goods may give the Japanese an excuse. However, we have admitted it without reservation in the League of Nations. Several proposed methods are attached: (1) Concentrate heavy troops in Rehe and northern Hebei, and strictly order the military commanders on the front lines to resist with all their might if the enemy invades, and seize the opportunity to recover lost territory; (2) The Party and the government should provide full material and spiritual support to the troops and volunteer armies fighting in the Northeast; (3) The Party and the government should fully lead the national people in boycotting Japanese goods.

<p>One of the Proposals of the Third Plenary Session</p>
<p>The Parts Regarding Foreign Affairs and Military Affairs Will Not Be Published</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke and twenty-seven other committee members proposed a plan at the Third Plenary Session to concentrate national strength to revitalize and save the nation. They stated that external troubles are becoming increasingly urgent, and the national crisis is becoming more serious every day. The reason why the government has not been able to actively resist Japan is that the authorities are constrained by complex environmental considerations. The core of these considerations is that there is no internal unity. First, there are divisions and mutual attacks between domestic political factions, which are due to inconsistent political views, the lack of openness in political power, and the lack of freedom of speech. Second, there is mutual suspicion and checks and balances between domestic military forces, which are due to the failure of the central and local governments to implement the principle of balanced governance and the lack of a policy from the central government that meets popular opinion. The first priority should be to gradually open up political power so that the people have the power to participate in politics, and then the improper means used by various factions today and the attacks can be eliminated. The second priority should be to make all military forces safe from each other and listen to the fair decisions of the central government, and then the phenomenon of suspicion, deception, and mutual restraint among military authorities can be eliminated. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>(Methods) A. There are three items regarding foreign affairs (Due to the confidentiality of foreign affairs, it is not convenient to publish).</p>
<p>B. Regarding current domestic politics: First, in order to concentrate the nation's manpower and enable everyone to give full play to their talents, achieve internal peace, jointly resist foreign aggression, and adjust the relationship between the central and local governments, and eliminate all civil wars, in addition to formulating other methods for promoting constitutional government and convening a National Assembly, the following measures should be taken in current domestic politics: The government should be responsible to the people and announce that it will earnestly implement the Party's political program to guarantee the people's freedom of assembly, association, speech, publication, residence, and belief, and prohibit all illegal interference and arbitrary arrests. Where necessary in fact, designate appropriate locations to establish local political affairs committees, implement the equal distribution of power between the central and local governments, and have central committee members participate in the political affairs committees in various places. Yìn, there are political affairs committees in Beiping and Guangzhou. The establishment and commissioning of these committees, as well as other newly established committees in various places, should be ordered by the government at the same time. Mǎo, all local measures should be implemented by the relevant jurisdictional authorities in accordance with the law. No temporary organs or individuals may issue orders without authorization or disrupt the administrative system. The central government should appoint political inspectors to go to various places to inspect the gains and losses of administration and the hardships of the people and report to the central government on a regular basis. The central government should formulate improvements and clearly establish rewards and punishments based on the actual situation. These reports and the central government's countermeasures should also be published at any time to solicit the support of public opinion across the country.</p>
<p>C. Regarding preparations for constitutional government: (1) In order to concentrate national strength, thoroughly resist foreign aggression, and save the nation from peril, we should actively follow the local self-government work stipulated in the Construction Outline in the near future, so as to continue preparations for the start of constitutional government. (2) It is planned that the period from January to June of the 22nd year of the Republic will be the period for drafting the constitution. The Legislative Yuan will draft the constitution and publish the draft constitution on October 10th of the 22nd year of the Republic to prepare for the people to study and prepare for submission to the National Assembly. (3) In April of the 23rd year of the Republic, the first National Assembly will be convened to discuss and approve the constitution and decide on the date of promulgation. (4) After the promulgation of the constitution, the government should formulate local systems in accordance with the constitution, earnestly complete local self-government, and all unfinished work during the period of political tutelage. (5) It is assumed that October 10th of the 23rd year of the Republic is the start date of constitutional government. (6) All people in the country may freely organize political groups and participate in politics under the principle of not endangering the Republic of China and not violating the Three Principles of the People. Except for active military personnel, all people should be eligible to elect and be elected as representatives to the National Assembly after amendments are made.</p>
<p>D. Regarding the National Assembly: (1) The first National Assembly will be jointly composed of representatives elected by the people of the whole country according to the proportion of the population of each province and special municipality and the professional groups of each province and special municipality. The ratio of the number of people and the detailed election law will be formulated by the Legislative Yuan before June of the 22nd year of the Republic. (2) The term of office of the National Assembly is two years per session, and a general meeting is convened once a year. The meeting period is one month, but in the event of a major incident that the government cannot be responsible for resolving, a special meeting may be convened for a period of half a month. During the adjournment of the Congress, its powers shall be exercised separately by the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan elected by the Congress. (3) The powers of the National Assembly are: Zi, to represent the highest power organ of the entire nation of the Republic of China in governing the country; Chou, to formulate and amend the Constitution of the Republic of China; Yin, to discuss and decide on draft laws, draft budgets, and draft final accounts, to discuss and decide on declarations of war, peace, and major political, economic, and military plans; Mao, to elect the head of state, the heads of government affairs, and the chief judicial officer; Chen, to elect members of the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan and organize the Legislative Yuan and the Supervisory Yuan; Ji, to supervise and impeach the government; Wu, to supervise and promote national local autonomy; (4) The National Assembly shall not be dissolved or interfered with in any way, and its representatives shall not be arrested.</p>
<p>E. Regarding the Provincial People's Congress: (1) Before the convening of the National Assembly, the government shall separately stipulate the convening of the Provincial People's Congress in each province according to the local governance situation in each province. The election and organizational laws shall be formulated by the Legislative Yuan before June of the 22nd year of the Republic.

<h3 id="e23">Opaque Outcome of the League of Nations Meeting <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The League of Nations Administrative Council meeting. It commenced on the 21st of last month, followed by the Nineteen-Nation Committee and a Special Assembly. The Nineteen-Nation Committee was then entrusted with making recommendations. Aside from some back-and-forth procedures, the only thing of note was the fierce verbal battle between the Chinese and Japanese representatives. British Foreign Secretary Simon even sympathized with the Japanese representative and defended them. Although reports state that the British side has</p>
<p>repeatedly offered gentle explanations to our authorities, claiming that Simon's intention was to promote reconciliation and that he had no intention of favoring any party, the recent Nineteen-Nation Committee meeting shows no evidence to demonstrate his impartiality. The League of Nations is controlled by Britain and France, and although other small countries wish to uphold justice, they are too weak to make decisions. Even if they do, they cannot implement them. Therefore, in this Special Assembly, the four countries of Ireland, Spain, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden proposed the two items "Non-self-defense means of the September 18th Incident" and "Denial of Manchukuo," which were recognized by the Lytton Report, but were buried. The Five-Nation Subcommittee on Sino-Japanese Disputes (meeting for four weeks) not only disregarded China's upright justice but also dared not offend Japan, which was using barbarous force. Although the draft resolution it prepared has not been made public, the main points of the resolution can be divided into the following four points.</p>
<p>"1. The Conciliation Committee expresses its gratitude to the Lytton Commission for producing a report that provides sufficient reference and utilization."</p>
<p>"2. Confirmation of the League of Nations Assembly resolution of March 11 of this year."</p>
<p>"3. The Nineteen-Nation Committee should include representatives from both China and Japan to facilitate conciliation."</p>
<p>"4. Invite the United States and Russia, hoping that they will participate in the conciliation efforts."</p>
<p>The merits of the Nineteen-Nation Committee and the evaluation of the League of Nations are fully reflected in the above resolution. The Chinese people will henceforth have another renewed understanding and a profound lesson.</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>However, Britain and France are not completely unrelated to the Far East. Their diplomatic relations with our country are still considered friendly, and market competition with Japanese imperialism is particularly difficult to coordinate. Why have they gone from being bystanders to understanding Japan and attacking China?</p>
<p>Since Britain abandoned the gold standard on September 20 of last year, its credibility in the world financial market has declined. It is almost inevitable that it will try to recover in the future. Therefore, it first engaged in the reorganization of its internal affairs and organized a united national cabinet. Under this political system, income tax, consumption tax, and tariffs were increased, and the costs of social policies were reduced. In short, internally, the hardworking masses were sacrificed, and externally, colonies and semi-colonies were exploited to seek recovery.</p>
<p>After the balancing of the budget and the Ottawa British Empire Economic Conference, the British Empire became an economic unit on its own, implementing a closed-door policy and abandoning its traditional free trade policy, adopting a protective tariff system. As a result, it regained independence in financial policy and increased the cash reserves of the Bank of England. However, the war debt issue suddenly stirred up trouble, and rifts arose in the Anglo-French alliance. The difficulties of unemployment have not been resolved, and international disputes have suddenly become intense. Therefore, it has to resort to its old strategy of uniting with Japan in the East to seek security in the Far East and to stabilize the Chinese market.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>France has been rampant in the European continent for a lifetime. Since the world economic panic, it has suffered very little. Until recently, its financial market has also fallen into a state of congestion. Although gold reserves in the treasury have been increasing day by day, capital flow has been decreasing. Insufficient finances have led to the exhaustion of financial resources. All countries in the European continent are hoping to survive temporarily in the midst of storms. Therefore, the more cash France absorbs, the worse the international lending relationship becomes. In other words, after the implementation of high tariffs, imports are restricted, and the purchasing power of foreign countries is low, so export trade can only deteriorate. The pursuit of investment venues is France's top priority. The Soviet Union is one of its targets, and China in the Far East is particularly suitable. However, if it does not form a strong alliance with Japan, it will be difficult to ensure that its investment in China will not be actively hindered. Therefore, although France does not want Japan to swallow the Northeast alone, it is separated by geography and force, and it has no power to intervene.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>The United States of America was a nouveau riche after the European war. It wielded its financial power and reigned over East Asia. Our country's fatigue and Japan's tyranny made it difficult to oppose. However, under the influence of the decline of Europe for the past year, and the turbulence of the Jinnyang Incident, the panic has intensified. The number of unemployed people exceeds 10 million. Cash outflows are nearly 1 billion. The financial budget, in the four months from July to the present, has a revenue shortfall of more than 600 million US dollars. The state of its poverty can be imagined. It has no surplus power to oppose Japan.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is restoring normal diplomatic relations with our country and is focusing all its efforts on domestic construction. It is not a member of the League of Nations, so how can it take the blame for the League of Nations? Moreover, it still insists on its attitude of calm observation and will never speak out. Therefore, it also politely declined the invitation of the Nineteen-Nation Committee, knowing that the League of Nations cannot restrain Japan's atrocities. Moreover, are the Nineteen Committee still subordinate to the League of Nations? If it participates in mediation at this time, it will not help the matter and will only provoke criticism from the Japanese and arouse our country's antipathy.</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>The powerlessness of the League of Nations has long been clear to the world. The situation of the great powers is also as described above. Whether it is Britain and France, which control Geneva diplomacy, or the United States and the Soviet Union, which stand outside the League of Nations, some want to share the spoils, some sigh in vain, and some are cold-eyed bystanders. None of them can alleviate our country's suffering. Can we continue to wait for the fair judgment of the League of Nations, which is forever impossible to expect, while being ravaged by Japanese warlords, without rising up to strive for self-reliance?</p>
<p>I still remember what the Central Party Headquarters said to the people in its book on September 18 of this year: "If there is reason to be spoken, speak reason. If there is no reason to be spoken, contend by force." In this special assembly of the League of Nations, we have exhausted our last loyalty and spoken reason with tears and blood. What is the result? Not only is there no reason to be spoken, but there is no way to speak any further. From now on, is there any other way besides "contending by force?"</p>
<h3 id="e24">The Resolution Drafted by the League of Nations Subcommittee is Vague and Ambiguous <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Recalling the March 11 Resolution to Organize a Conciliation Committee and Invite China, Japan, the United States, and Russia to Participate</p>
<p>Expressing Gratitude to the Investigative Commission and Suggesting the Lytton Report as a Basis for Conciliation</p>
<p>Leaving Room for Japan to Quibble</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Simon's Pro-Japan Bias is Obvious</p>
<p>No Deadline for Resolution is Specified</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Representatives Request Instructions from Their Respective Governments</p>
<p>(Geneva) The draft resolution prepared by the Subcommittee of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee is quite vague and ambiguous due to the influence of Britain's pro-Japan bias, as if to leave room for Japan to quibble. If British Foreign Secretary Simon had not returned to London on Wednesday, the results would have been even worse. According to a report from a reporter from the Central News Agency, the initial draft of the Subcommittee only stipulated that the basis for conciliation would be the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact for resolving disputes by peaceful means, but did not include the Nine-Power Treaty, which clearly guaranteed China's territorial and administrative integrity. Only after a request from our country's representative was it added. Furthermore, the draft resolution did not specify a time limit for resolution, only stating that the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee should report on the results of conciliation to the Assembly by March 1 of next year, rather than submit recommendations. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that the draft resolution approved by the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee on the evening of the 15th contains four items: (1) Expressing admiration for the work of the Lytton Commission and using its report in the work of the Conciliation Committee; (2) Reaffirming the resolution of March 11; (3) Proposing that the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee serve as the Conciliation Committee, supplemented by representatives from China and Japan; (4) Suggesting that the United States and Russia be invited to participate in the conciliation efforts. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The draft resolution prepared by the Subcommittee of the Nineteen-Nation Committee has been completed today and sent to the leaders of the Chinese and Japanese delegations for review. After obtaining their consent, it will be submitted to the League of Nations Assembly. As for its content, although the members of the committee are trying to keep it secret, reliable sources say that this resolution is relatively vague and does not assume any responsibility, and the committee may have to try to draft it again.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Nineteen-Nation Committee held a meeting for a short time today and passed three documents drafted by the Subcommittee, preparing to submit them to the League of Nations Assembly after obtaining the consent of China and Japan.</p>
<p>(The first document) is to suggest the aforementioned draft resolution. Its content mainly consists of the League of Nations Assembly reiterating the outline of the resolution of the last Assembly on March 11, and each member state guaranteeing that it will not recognize any situation or treaty produced by means that violate the Covenant and the Pact of Paris. Secondly, it focuses on the conditions of the Covenant, the Pact of Paris, and the Nine-Power Treaty. Thirdly, it suggests the establishment of a Conciliation Committee, with the Nineteen-Nation Committee as members, and adding the two countries involved, China and Japan. The United States and Russia, because they have significant interests in the Far East, should also be invited to participate. This Conciliation Committee should consider Chapters 9 and 10 of the Lytton Report and submit a report on March 1 of next year.</p>
<p>(The second document) is said to be quite short, only expressing gratitude for the impartial work of the Lytton Commission.</p>
<p>(The third document) is two pages long and details the reasons for the Nineteen-Nation Committee drafting the resolution. In this report, it is strongly argued that the League of Nations Assembly should adopt conciliation measures in accordance with Article 15, Section 3 of the Covenant, and explain the need to invite the United States and Russia to participate in conciliation. It is said that the historical part of the Lytton Report on the Manchurian case is unbiased, and that both advocating a return to the original state and recognizing "Manchukuo" are impossible. Therefore, it is necessary to find some compromise solutions.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the attitude of people in the League of Nations is to hope that the final resolution of the League of Nations Assembly will be sufficiently vague and not assume any responsibility, in order to please Japan, so that the Japanese can continue to participate in the conciliation work. However, the resolution of the committee should be slightly tougher, and it can ignore the approval of the League of Nations Assembly, in order to please China and obtain the cooperation of the United States and Russia. (National Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chairman of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee claimed to people today that very active negotiations are underway to seek an agreement on the organization of the conciliation mechanism for handling the Sino-Japanese dispute. The governments of the United States and Russia will be invited to join this mechanism. After the meeting of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee yesterday, he met with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations to inquire about the opinions of the Chinese and Japanese representatives on this method. He has contacted both parties on this matter and is now awaiting the replies from the two governments. The League of Nations Assembly is likely to be delayed for several days before it can convene. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The resolution passed by the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee yesterday was checked for the number of copies and sealed after the meeting, which proves the secrecy of the meeting. It is reported that the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee suggested that the committee be the Conciliation Committee, supplemented by representatives from China and Japan. The committee should submit a report to the League of Nations within six months. Dr. Yan Huiqing has advocated this point for several months, believing that if conciliation is ineffective within the specified period, the Conciliation Committee should prepare a report, and there may be proposals for sanctions at that time. The conciliation methods contained in Chapters 9 and 10 of the Lytton Report should have a chance of success. The Nineteen-Nation Special Committee decided not to express any opinions on the merits of the dispute, in order to avoid any suspicion of favoritism, but will reaffirm the resolution of March 11, not recognizing changes made in violation of the Covenant. This move is to satisfy the small countries, as the small countries have reluctantly abandoned the claim of not recognizing "Manchukuo". The League of Nations Assembly will likely convene on Monday or Tuesday of next week to discuss this resolution. It is expected that after this meeting, the entire issue will be postponed to next year for further handling. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the work of the Drafting Committee, the following is a continuation of the news. The Drafting Committee has passed two resolutions and one statement of reasons yesterday, and the first part of its work has been completed. The principles on which the conciliation of the Sino-Japanese dispute should be based have also been determined. As for the conciliation procedure, the Drafting Committee advocates organizing a small committee, with experts and specially qualified people as members, which may refer to the members of the Lytton Commission, but it is not certain. The Drafting Committee also suggested that the Extraordinary Assembly should invite the United States and Russia to participate. The Nineteen-Nation Committee was therefore reorganized into a Twenty-One-Nation Committee. According to the League of Nations Covenant, the final report on the Sino-Japanese dispute should be published within six months. Later, the Extraordinary Assembly decided to postpone it. The Chinese representative repeatedly requested a definite deadline for publication. The above statement of reasons is to satisfy the Chinese side's request. The statement said that the Conciliation Committee should determine the deadline for submitting the final report by the end of this year. If the work of the Conciliation Committee is completed, the final report will only describe the facts of the case. If the conciliation fails, the final report will include various proposals. As for the principles on which the conciliation work should be based, according to the statement of reasons, the League of Nations Covenant, the Pact of Paris, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty should be given the most attention. Then, it recalls the resolution of the Assembly on March 11, which does not recognize the situation created by violence. It also describes Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report on the principles of conciliation and Chapter 10 on the methods of conciliation. Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report recommends granting extensive autonomy to Manchuria, organizing a gendarmerie, withdrawing all other troops, and building China through international cooperation. Chapter 10 of the Lytton Report proposes convening a consultation meeting, with representatives from both China and Japan and two groups of representatives of residents of Manchuria participating. One group of representatives is elected by the method prescribed by China, and the other is elected by the method prescribed by Japan. In addition, neutral observers can also participate in the meeting. If there are different opinions, the Executive Council of the League of Nations should resolve them. The statement of reasons also stated that all the proposed methods are based on Article 15, Section 3 of the Covenant. The reason for not making any judgments is that the conciliation work must be free to use. (Havas Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Intention to Delay the Resolution of the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>Merely Becoming a Mechanism for Japan and the Great Powers</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' intention to delay the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute is undeniable. The League of Nations has merely become the League of Nations of Japan and the Great Powers. Japan needs to delay to complete its plan in the three eastern provinces. The League of Nations, hopeless from the beginning, also welcomes the delay to preserve its face. As for the Great Powers, in order to avoid Japan's resistance, they also believe that it is better to let it develop naturally, resolving it without resolving it. Under this situation, our country cannot even obtain a satisfactory resolution on paper. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Completely Following Japan's Intentions</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chinese delegation is very disappointed with the draft submitted by the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee to the Assembly. Today, the spokesperson of the Chinese delegation stated that the draft resolution is far from what we expected. According to the League of Nations Covenant, China should enjoy the right to a limited-term report. It is particularly disappointing that the draft does not specify the deadline for the final report. Furthermore, there are no provisions in the draft to deal with the situation in the three eastern provinces, nor are there any measures to prevent Japan from continuing its aggression. (Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Although the resolution passed by the secret meeting of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee has not been revealed, according to reliable sources, the resolution is in line with Japan's intentions, so the Chinese delegation is very indifferent to it. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>Opposes the Participation of the United States and Russia</p>
<p>Continues to Use Intimidation Tactics</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese representatives, including Representative Matsuoka, will immediately request instructions from their home government regarding the results of the Nineteen-Nation Committee. After discussion, the representatives believed that the adoption of the Lytton Report meant not recognizing "Manchukuo", so they unanimously opposed it. The British representative Simon's comforting speech at the Nineteen-Nation Committee on the 15th had the opposite effect, resulting in a more unfavorable situation for Japan. The Japanese representatives have prepared for all contingencies and decided that there is no other option but to withdraw from the League of Nations. (Japan League Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The intentions of the Japanese Army authorities regarding the resolution of the Nineteen-Nation Committee are as follows: The Army has only received the previous article, and the entire text has not yet been received. The Army is absolutely opposed to declaring that the Lytton Report is accepted, which means not recognizing the Liutiao Lake Incident as an act of self-defense. Furthermore, the adoption of the March 11 resolution means that Japan's actions violated the Pact of Paris, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Nine-Power Treaty, so it cannot be approved either. Furthermore, regarding the invitation of the United States and Russia, it is necessary to oppose Russia's participation today when China and Russia have restored diplomatic relations. Furthermore, the government will consult with the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the full text arrives,</p>

<p>and then instruct Plenipotentiary Matsuoka. (Dentsu Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of the Army received the news that the resolution of the Nineteen-Nation Committee may not be beneficial to Japan, and the major and minor warlords were very indignant. A certain director said that the Japanese people must recognize this paper tiger, which is powerless to resolve international disputes. The Sino-Japanese dispute has not been resolved, and Mexico has already withdrawn from the League of Nations. Disputes have also arisen between Britain and Poland, and France has caused the cabinet to fall due to war debts. The Great Powers are too busy taking care of themselves, how can they resolve the disputes of other countries? Among the Great Powers, such as Germany and Italy, both want to find an opportunity to withdraw from the League of Nations. It can be seen that the League of Nations is an organization that transcends the state. It is a pipe dream to use this organization to resolve international disputes. No matter how the League of Nations deals with the Sino-Japanese dispute, if it is unfavorable to Japan, it will implement the original strategy and will not be afraid of it. (Chinese Alliance Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reviewed the draft resolution that the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee will submit to the Assembly after receiving it this afternoon and found that there were several points that needed to be revised. It is expected that the telegram will be sent to the Geneva delegation tomorrow night. Japan cannot accept the section on reaffirming the resolution of March 11, because the Japanese government believes that the overall situation is now stable and different from before. However, the Japanese government suggests that only the spirit of various peace treaties can be invoked. Japan also opposes inviting the United States and Russia to participate in the Conciliation Committee, because Russia and the United States are not members of the League of Nations. Japan cannot recognize the section in the draft regarding the Lytton Commission's "impartial work". In addition to these points that need to be revised, it is reported that the Japanese government will instruct its delegation to propose suggestions to maintain the dignity of the League of Nations as much as possible within the possible scope.

<p>Japan's Hatred for Him Deepens</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The general atmosphere in Geneva on the 14th was considered favorable to Japan, so the Japanese delegation telegraphed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs with a very triumphant attitude. However, after British Foreign Secretary Simon returned to England, the Spanish representative took the opportunity to contact various representatives and strongly advocated that the League of Nations must maintain justice, otherwise it would eventually fall into an irreparable crisis. Therefore, the atmosphere changed accordingly, and the resolution became more unfavorable to Japan. As a result, Japan's anger towards Spain became more and more blatant.

Regarding the defense of Yantai and Longkou, I hope the navy will maintain it best. If the navy is insufficient, the Third Route Army can assist. Commander Shen hopes that after Liu's troops leave, the Third Route Army will quickly take over the defense. Outsiders are trying to alienate the navy and the Third Route Army by saying that the Third Route Army will definitely compete for the Yantai and Longkou ports. In fact, only warlords compete for ports. I am not a warlord and will never compete for ports. Liu's troops in Yantai will be able to leave completely within days. Liu's troops in Laiyang have already left completely. A small number of defeated soldiers from Liu's troops are living in Weixian.

<p>The re-election of the German Reichstag, again held on October 6th, although inevitably slightly affected by the Berlin transport workers' strike beforehand, was generally orderly and stable. Fortunately, there were no major clashes, bloodshed, or tragic election dramas. The results of this Reichstag re-election, the distribution of votes and seats, are as follows:</p>
<p>Party                               Votes                Seats</p>
<p>National Socialist Workers' Party  11,713,785           195</p>
<p>Social Democratic Party           7,237,894           121</p>
<p>German Communist Party            5,974,209           100</p>
<p>Centre Party                      4,228,633            69</p>
<p>German National People's Party     3,064,977            51</p>
<p>Bavarian People's Party          1,081,932            19</p>
<p>German People's Party               660,092            11</p>
<p>German State Party                  338,064             2</p>
<p>Christian Social People's Service Party 412,685       5</p>
<p>Economic Party                      110,181             2</p>
<p>German Farmers' Party               148,990             3</p>
<p>Others                              436,866             4</p>
<p>Total                             35,402,306          577</p>
<p>In terms of the number of votes, the number of voters in this election decreased by 5% compared to the previous election. In terms of the number of seats, the previous election produced 607 members, while this time there were only 577, a decrease of 30, which is a matter of great concern. The reason for this is, on the one hand, that the people are tired of elections, a phenomenon known as "Wahlmüdigkeit" (election fatigue). Since the last five months, the German people have experienced 13 major elections and 700 minor elections, and the people are overwhelmed by the frequency. Therefore, many passive citizens gave up their right to vote this time. This fact was anticipated by German public opinion, so it is not surprising. Furthermore, dissecting and observing the election results of each faction, the National Socialist Labor Party, occupying 195 seats, still holds the leading position among the parliamentary parties, but compared to the election results three months ago, its voter numbers have sharply declined, suffering a tremendous defeat. Hitler must be discouraged. Hitler's fascist movement has suffered a fatal blow, and it is not impossible that it will disintegrate as a result. When the results of the previous July 31st</p>
<p>Reichstag election were announced, British, French, American, and Russian public opinion all made direct and clear judgments, stating that the German fascist movement had reached its peak and would not make any further progress in the future. Their predictions were accurate. The reasons for this failure are extremely complex, but to summarize, there are approximately the following main reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The people gradually realized that Hitler's claims were mostly hollow and impractical.</p>
<p>(2) Hitler's economic policies became increasingly communist, losing the support of the middle class.</p>
<p>(3) The Lausanne Conference's acceptance of Germany's request to suspend reparations eased the German xenophobia.</p>
<p>(4) Hitler's party members were too rampant, constantly clashing with the Communist Party, resulting in bloody tragedies, causing social unrest, and arousing hatred among the people.</p>
<p>(5) After Hitler's failure in the presidential and July 31st Reichstag election campaigns, his energy waned, and the tide of the movement receded.</p>
<p>With these five reasons, the decline of fascism is inevitable. The Social Democratic Party, due to its relatively moderate and stable attitude, also slightly declined in this election compared to the previous election, but it is still the second most important party in the Reichstag. The Centre Party, since the collapse of the Brüning cabinet, has seen its political power decline. In addition, Brüning and Papen within the party have disagreed, showing signs of disintegration. Furthermore, without concrete solutions and proposals for the current economic panic and unemployment problems in Germany, the party's value has gradually diminished. Therefore, in this Reichstag election, it only obtained 69 seats. However, the far-left German Communist Party, in this Reichstag election, saw a surprisingly rapid increase in voter numbers. It can also be said to be the party that achieved the greatest victory in this Reichstag election, occupying 100 seats in the Reichstag and becoming the third most important party. The surge in the Communist Party's votes this time has posed a tremendous threat to the far-right National Socialist Labor Party. In world public opinion and politics, it cannot but attract attention. The reasons for the increase in the Communist Party's votes are, firstly, due to the economic panic and the problem of unemployed workers in Germany, and secondly, due to the increasing development and tension of anti-capitalist and world revolution ideologies.</p>
<p>Now that the new Reichstag has been re-elected, and the distribution of seats is as mentioned above, no single party, from the far left to the far right, has been able to obtain an absolute majority of seats in the parliament. Then, how will the so-called majority faction of the parliamentary government be formed and produced? This Reichstag re-election has produced 577 members. To be an absolute majority, 289 members are needed. The National Socialist Labor Party only has 195 members, which is of course far from that number. It is unable to become the absolute majority faction in the parliament on its own. The left-wing Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party combined have 221 members, which is a greater force than the right-wing. However, they still do not meet the qualifications for an absolute majority faction in the parliament. Only the Communist Party can cooperate with the right-wing, i.e., the National Socialist Labor Party, to obtain 295 members and form an absolute majority faction. However, in the end, these two parties, one turning to the left and the other running to the right, are diametrically opposed, and their opinions are as incompatible as ice and charcoal. It is extremely difficult to believe that cats and mice can cooperate. In conclusion, it can be seen that the formation of the new German Reichstag and the problem of the government's majority faction are just as difficult as the situation in the Reichstag elected on July 31st. The future is very grey and bleak.</p>
<p>The reason why Papen previously dissolved the Reichstag elected on July 31st was precisely because the Reichstag could not form an absolute majority faction in the government. If the newly re-elected Reichstag still cannot form an absolute majority faction in the government, then how will the Papen cabinet deal with it? If Papen cannot find a proper solution to this problem, then the fate of his cabinet cannot but be doomed to collapse due to the Reichstag re-election. On the eve of this Reichstag re-election, Papen gave an extremely solemn election speech to the entire German nation through loudspeakers, and clearly expressed his abandonment of his consistent pro-right attitude, strongly criticizing the inappropriate behavior of the right and left parties, and proposing a new proposition, the so-called supra-party politics. He believes that in Germany's current extremely dangerous and impoverished situation, fragmented and divisive political parties are of no help in overcoming difficulties. The only way out for saving the country in the future is for all Germans to take the overall interests of the nation and the country as the premise, stand on the same front and group, and be directed by the meritorious President Hindenburg, so that the practical effect of saving the country can be achieved. In other words, Papen's view is that the future Reichstag should move away from the direction of partisan divisions and form a supra-party coalition parliamentary government majority faction. This so-called supra-party coalition work problem is also deeply sympathized with by current public opinion, forming the core and focus of the newly elected Reichstag. However, there is little hope that this new proposition of Papen will be accepted by the various political parties. Because of his speech on the eve of this Reichstag re-election, which greatly attacked the right and left factions, he aroused extreme resentment from the Communist Party and Hitler's party members, to the extent that they had to overthrow the Papen cabinet immediately. Therefore, almost all of the newly elected Reichstag members are opposed to Papen, and can also be said to be anti-government. With such thorny difficulties, it is thought that Papen will not easily break through them. On Papen's side, there is the protective talisman of Article 48 of the National Constitution to preserve his position. When the Reichstag cannot form a government majority faction or when there are other difficult problems that cannot be resolved, Article 48 of the National Constitution can be applied, and the Reichstag can be ordered to be dissolved and re-elected. It should be known that since Papen took office as the premier of the cabinet, he has twice ordered the dissolution of the Reichstag due to the parliament's vote of no confidence. The people cannot bear the frequency of elections, and from an economic point of view, the two elections have cost a total of 77 million marks. Therefore, the more elections there are, the greater the burden on the people. If Papen still wants to use this constitutional provision as a talisman to deal with the Reichstag and protect himself, he may eventually provoke actual revolutionary actions by the various parties and plunge the political situation into greater unrest. Papen has now decided to consult with President Hindenburg in two weeks to determine his attitude and steps towards the new Reichstag. The opening date of the new Reichstag, according to constitutional regulations, should be held within one month after the election. The official announcement of this matter, as of the time the reporter took up his pen, has not yet been made, but public opinion speculates that the first meeting of the new Reichstag will be convened on December 6th, in Freiburg, Germany.</p>

<p>The Nagasaki Daily News says, "The map of Manchuria" was originally a military map obtained from Russia during the Russo-Japanese War. Later, based on this map, a rough estimate of its area and terrain was made. However, in reality, it is quite incomplete. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity of Manchuria's independence, there is a need to create a detailed military map. The Survey Department of the Army General Staff has repeatedly discussed the matter carefully with the leadership and is now ready. It has selected survey technicians who are proficient in the geography of Manchuria and will send them to conduct actual surveys under armed escort. On the other hand, the Ministry of Education has decided to revise the geography textbooks for higher elementary schools in "Manchuria" starting from the new semester in April next year. The content records an area of 1.1 million square miles and a population of 35 million people. In addition, in order to explore the resources and the mysterious endless treasures of the region, survey personnel, under armed escort by the Kwantung Army, are dispatched to various places. In places where forests and mountains cannot be traversed by human power, lighter-than-air balloons and airplanes are used for three-dimensional surveying. According to Lieutenant Colonel Matsuoka of the General Staff, the completion of a Japanese map takes 38 years. The map of Manchuria requires 50 years to complete a detailed investigation and survey.</p>

<p>Burned for Four Hours, More Than Ten Dead and Over a Hundred Injured</p>
<p>Half of the Eight-Story Building Destroyed, Losses of Five Million</p>
<p>Five Army Aircraft Busy Rescuing People</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 16th - This morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the eight-story Shirokiya Department Store here. For a time, flames shot out and thick smoke rose. Firefighters worked hard to rescue the hundreds of people trapped inside the store, and the army, armed with bayonet-tipped guns, assisted the police in clearing the crowd of onlookers nearby. The fire started on the third floor and spread upwards. The customers in the store were all panicked, mostly women and children. It is reported that the fire started in the section of old Christmas incense toys. Customers and female shop assistants on the upper floors ran to the roof garden, shouting for help. It is reported that three people jumped from the sixth-floor windows and fell to their deaths on the road. At that time, army aircraft dropped life-saving equipment on the roof garden to rescue those trapped there.</p>
<p>Continued Telegram - The fire at the Shirokiya Department Store burned for three and a half hours before it was extinguished. It is reported that a total of ten people died and over a hundred were injured, with about fifty people seriously injured. The amount of loss is approximately 5 million yen. When the fire was raging, the two lions kept in the animal enclosure on the roof garden also tried to escape, causing even more panic among the crowd.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - Due to the fire at Shirokiya, as of noon, it has been confirmed that the number of deaths has reached eleven. Firefighters and police are still cooperating to search the burnt remains, and the number of deaths may still increase.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 16th - The cause of the fire at Shirokiya is currently under investigation. It seems to be near the toys sold before Christmas on the fourth floor, where the electric light wire was damaged and leaked electricity, causing the fire. The fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh floors have all been burned. However, the forty or fifty customers who took refuge on the roof were rescued. Among the seventy female servants in the dining hall, thirty were rescued, and the remaining forty are feared to have died or been injured. Also, of the seventy seriously injured people admitted to Nihonbashi Hospital at 11:00 AM, six have died. Because the door was opened for rescue and the fire started immediately afterwards, there were relatively few customers. If it had been at noon, there would have been more deaths and injuries.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance News Agency, Tokyo, 16th - After the fire at Shirokiya, the police used their best efforts to rescue the shop assistants above the third floor. This work was quite difficult, so they requested the army to send aircraft for rescue. Five army aircraft were dispatched at 11:00 AM, dropped long ropes from the air, and began rescuing people. By 12:50 PM, seven people had died and ninety were injured.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Six Countries Paid, Five Did Not <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 15th - The countries that paid their debts today include England, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania, totaling US$125 million. The countries that did not pay their debts are France, Belgium, Poland, Estonia, and Hungary, owing a total of US$25 million.</p>
<p>Kokumin, London, 15th - This morning, the Bank of England marked gold bars worth £19,750,000, indicating that they now belong to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the United States, as payment for the British war debt due to the United States today. The transportation procedures are currently being prepared by brokers. Because insurance companies are currently unwilling to guarantee huge amounts of money, it will probably be shipped in more than ten shipments. The Bank of England also stated today that after selling gold bars worth £19,632,831 to the government, the current gold reserves are £120,672,169.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Washington, 15th - US Treasury Secretary Mills stated that after France, Belgium, and other countries defaulted on their war debts, although it would increase the treasury deficit for this fiscal year, there was no way to do anything about it. As for the business relationship with France, Belgium, and other countries, it will continue as usual. For example, Russia has not paid a single cent to its creditors, but various countries continue to do business with it as usual. According to the twelve debtor countries, it is hoped that nine countries will pay all or part of their debts today. Even Lithuania paid US$92,386.01 in gold yuan with a check from a bank in Washington, DC. Although there has been some reaction in the US Congress to the default on war debts, such as Senator McKellar's proposal to levy a passport fee of $5,000 each time to force travelers not to enter debtor countries, and Congressman Mansfield also made a similar proposal, it is expected that it will not be discussed immediately.</p>
<p>Havas, Romanian Capital, 15th - The grace period for Eastern European countries to receive Eastern reparations expired today. Romania has recently agreed to extend the grace period by six months and has notified the International Clearing Bank of this matter. Romania has obtained an exchange condition for this concession, that is, the UK and France have agreed to extend the grace period for Romania's debts to them by six months.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Warsaw, 15th - The political circles here have been deeply impressed by the French Parliament's refusal to repay the US war debt. The Polish government is now asking the United States for a grace period for the war debt. If this request is rejected by the United States, the Polish government will resolutely refuse to pay the debt due in November, following the example of France. The Polish government has expressed its willingness to discuss with the United States how to determine a solution to the war debt problem, but given the current economic difficulties, it is impossible to immediately repay the 27 million zlotys (Polish currency) due in December.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Prague, 15th - The Czechoslovak government has paid US$1.5 million in gold yuan for the US war debt due in December.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Lithuanian Capital, 15th - The Lithuanian government has paid the US war debt due in December today, totaling US$91,000 in US treasury bonds. Lithuania had previously requested a grace period, but it was not approved by the United States.</p>
<p>Germany Strives for Revival</p>
<h3 id="e91">Schleicher Announces Political Program <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Large-Scale Re-Agriculturalization Plan</p>
<p>Restore Conscription System to Train Youth</p>
<p>Kokumin, Berlin, 15th - Prime Minister Schleicher said in a radio speech tonight that he neither supports capitalism nor socialism, because these doctrines, in the strict sense, no longer exist and have lost their appeal in economic life.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Oppose Military Dictatorship <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Schleicher said that he was apprehensive when he was appointed, because being appointed as Prime Minister from the position of Minister of Defense can easily lead people to suspect that he wants to establish a military dictatorship. Therefore, he asked the people not to regard him as a soldier, but as someone entrusted with the interests of people from all walks of life, so that they can overcome the short-term difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Seeking Work for the People <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>As for the government's administrative policy, in a word, it is to seek work for the people, because this is what the people are most concerned about. As for amending the constitution and other good things that cannot stop hunger, they are not what the government wants. Only the revival of commerce can end the panic of unemployment. However, it is useless to comfort the people with empty words, saying that after a famine year, there will be a bumper year. Therefore, the cabinet is currently drafting a great plan to seek work for the people.</p>
<p>The cabinet will also avoid inflation, not levy new taxes in the next fiscal year, and not reduce official salaries and wages again.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Focus on Developing Agriculture <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Developing agriculture is also an essential plan for relieving unemployment. Next year, an initial appropriation of 50 million marks will be used to relocate immigrants to Eastern Prussia and other places, followed by another appropriation of 50 million marks, which will be provided by the German Bank. The main reason for the suffering of Germany and the world is that there are few farmers and many people making a living in cities. It is now urgent to remedy this shortcoming, but it will take at least thirty years to achieve success. The cabinet will first operate to revitalize the domestic market, but the foreign market should also be given importance. The previous Papen cabinet had already started this undertaking, and this cabinet will inherit its legacy. The previous cabinet's measures to help farmers will also be vigorously promoted.</p>
<p>Private enterprises and state enterprises are currently mixed and unclear, causing many harms. The cabinet will now pay special attention to this matter to make the boundaries clear so that each can benefit.</p>
<p>The parliament has recently cancelled some of the stricter provisions in the emergency decree issued on September 4th. The cabinet has actually assisted in this.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Alleviate the Suffering of Unemployment <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The suffering of millions of unemployed people cannot be relieved in a few months, but he must do his best to alleviate it. Schleicher then enumerated several of the temporary relief plans that are currently being considered for implementation, such as reducing the price of meat and coal, and may also reduce the price of milk and bread.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Curb Terrorism <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Schleicher continued by saying that emergency plans to curb political terrorism cannot be used to govern the country all the time, so he has asked the President to cancel it. If there are still people who do not know themselves and have extraordinary actions, the government will still issue strict orders to govern the chaos. Schleicher then issued a warning to the Communist Party.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Restore Conscription <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Schleicher then touched on the issue of youth training, saying that parents and teachers have recently sent him sincere letters urging him to restore conscription. There is nothing better than this system for enabling young people to learn the ways of self-government, humility, and friendship. My repeated advocacy of using conscription to train militias is for this main reason.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Demanding Armament <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Subsequently, regarding Germany's position on the issue of disarmament, he said that he often solemnly declared that our country is prepared to supply the army with lead knives and paper quality, as long as neighboring countries do the same. Otherwise, the Germans are also unwilling to let their heads be cut off by others, so they demand that their national defense forces should guarantee the same security as other countries. The Italian government has always supported our people's demand for equal rights. This is what Germany</p>

<p>Reuters, Berlin, 15th - When the Berlin City Council met today, thirty women disturbed the meeting, shouting, "We want food, clothing, and coal!" Two council staff members stepped forward to stop them, but were beaten and injured. Not long after, the police rushed in, and they dispersed immediately upon seeing them.</p>
<p>The people should be sincerely grateful for this. The German people want to be treated as a free and respectable nation, and to enjoy equal rights with other nations with the same history and ability. The German government will respond to the work arising from the current situation with calm determination and perseverance, and is prepared to work sincerely with the governments of all countries that have the will to solve international problems with justice and good faith understanding.</p>

<p>Finally, he again discussed the current political situation, warning the various parties, hoping that they would deeply reflect that their existence is not to survive for the sake of the party. When they refuse to cooperate in governing the country, they must not lose their judgment. It must be known that the people's trust in political parties is based on their expectation that they will take positive action. Therefore, if they only do nothing and are fond of petty tricks, the people's hearts will turn away from them.</p>

<p>Herriot's Resignation is Firm</p>
<p>Political Turmoil Likely to Escalate</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 15th: French Premier Herriot resigned yesterday and has definitively declined the President's request to form a new cabinet. Former Radical Party member Shao Dan has been ordered today to attempt cabinet formation. Shao and Herriot are close friends, and Shao might not form a new cabinet without Herriot's participation. However, Shao is a well-received and skilled negotiator, and he can likely establish the foundation for a new cabinet and then yield ground to accommodate figures such as Peng Gu. It is widely expected that Peng Gu will accept a new position.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 15th: President Lebrun continues to seek opinions from various parties to resolve the cabinet crisis. Former Premier Laval visited the President and left at 4 PM, stating that this political turmoil should be resolved as soon as possible. However, regarding budgetary and diplomatic issues, I fear the political turmoil is only just beginning. Central Party member Franklin Bouillon stated after meeting with the President that it is better to discuss this cabinet crisis at length rather than seek a hasty solution. Hasty actions will surely trigger another political crisis, especially since the budget may not be approved for three months. The President then summoned Herriot, asking him to try to form a new cabinet. Herriot replied that he has various conscientious objections that he does not wish to violate and respectfully declines the order to form a cabinet. He also stated that whoever reorganizes the cabinet, he will definitely not join, and he declares this in advance to avoid embarrassing the future Premier with his refusal to participate. The President then entrusted Shao Dan, a member of the Radical Socialist Party and former mayor, to try to form a cabinet. Shao requested time to respond tomorrow.</p>

<p>Participation of the Investigation Team</p>
<p>Verbal Battles Between Chinese and Japanese Representatives</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chinese representative, while in Changchun, sent a document to the Investigation Team on May 3 regarding the interference by Japanese police he encountered when meeting with two foreign teachers at the Yamato Hotel. One section reads as follows: "Upon opening the door, five or six Japanese individuals were seen, with one leading man insistently trying to enter the room to investigate the identity of the visitors and the purpose of their visit. It was later learned that this Japanese individual was the chief of the Changchun Police Department of the Kwantung Leased Territory. After entering the room, he did not leave until the Chinese representative stepped out of his private chamber. At this time, Mr. Esde, a member of the Investigation Team, happened to pass by and inquired of the Japanese police chief, who revealed that he wanted to know if the Chinese representative had obtained permission from the Japanese police to meet with foreign guests, and whether these foreign guests had also obtained permission from the Japanese police to visit the Chinese representative." When the Chinese representative was in Jilin, he was "escorted" everywhere by Japanese soldiers carrying rifles with bayonets. In Harbin, he was "escorted" by uniformed and plainclothes Japanese police officers. Due to these inappropriate restrictions and prohibitions, the Chinese representative was unable to accompany the Investigation Team to the scene of incidents to investigate everything or to present Chinese witnesses for the Investigation Team's interviews. Chinese people in the Three Eastern Provinces were absolutely not allowed to meet with the Investigation Team or Chinese representatives without the permission of the Japanese authorities. Report 107 states, "However, the result of various methods by the Japanese police was only to isolate all witnesses. Many Chinese were even afraid to meet with members of the Investigation Team. The Investigation Team learned in one place that before its arrival, the authorities had announced that no one could meet with the Investigation Team without official approval. Therefore, all visits by the Investigation Team were conducted secretly, with great difficulty, and many people found this secret meeting method to be dangerous. Most of the delegations received by the Investigation Team were introduced by the Japanese authorities or the 'Manchukuo' authorities. The members of the committee firmly believe that their written opinions must have been approved by Japan beforehand." The treatment of the Chinese representative and his staff by the Japanese authorities in the Three Eastern Provinces, a part of Chinese territory, contrasted sharply with the immense freedom and convenience granted to the Japanese representative by the Chinese authorities in other parts of China. The Chinese authorities never attempted in any way to hinder the Japanese representative from presenting Japanese witnesses or Japanese people to the Investigation Team to offer their opinions when the Investigation Team was in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, and other places. The above points are merely a preliminary indication. Now, I will express my opinion on a few of the more important issues and facts presented in the report.</p>
<p>The Japanese government has claimed that China is not an organized nation. While this statement superficially defends Japan's improper actions in China, especially in the Three Eastern Provinces, its true purpose is to confuse public opinion and avoid the real issues. China is one of the original member states of the League of Nations. For the Japanese government to address it with such disparaging terms shows a lack of accumulation and reveals that the Japanese side has absolutely no sound justification for its arguments in this case. China is currently in the process of transforming from a four-thousand-year-old imperial system to a modern democratic system. The various difficulties it faces are not surprising to anyone familiar with the political history of national transformations. The various complex forces and factors within China are merely manifestations of the power and vitality of the awakened Chinese nation and a testament to the progress of the nation on which the livelihood of 450 million people depends. The phenomena in China's transition process may not be entirely satisfactory to outside observers, but these phenomena are common in any renovation process of an old structure. The most important point is what is stated in the seventeenth section of the Investigation Team's report: "Despite various difficulties, delays, and failures, the Chinese government has achieved quite a bit."</p>
<p>Inspection Notes on Suppressing Communists and Recovering Various Areas (2)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Refugees Gradually Gather in Yuekou <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yuekou is an important town in the central area of Hubei Province, located on the Xiang River. Communist suppression military operations are centered here. In August 1930, it was occupied by the Red Army for three days, resulting in burning, killing, looting, and losses of over two million. Although it was later recovered by the National Army, the surrounding areas were rampant with bandits, causing the people to live in insecurity, businesses to decline, and rural areas to be destroyed. The original vitality has not yet been restored. At that time, the southern bank of the Xiang River was entirely occupied by bandits. The National Army and the bandits confronted each other across the river for a long time, engaging in bloody battles before finally driving back the bandits, advancing on Qianjiang, and directly attacking Honghu. Currently, Yuekou is the defense area of the Tenth Army. The General Headquarters and the Tenth Army Headquarters are located here. A special service regiment is stationed here. Local order is maintained jointly by the military and police. The militia organization uses spears and broadswords as weapons and does not have modern firearms. There are about eight battalions with over a thousand men. The people's self-defense organization is already taking shape. If further training and replenishment of firearms are provided, the people will be able to defend themselves against bandits and clear the countryside. A household survey was conducted once after the bandits were driven back. Currently, refugees are gradually gathering, and preparations for the Baojia system are underway. As for rural cooperation, it has not yet been implemented due to time constraints. In terms of education, there were several primary schools, but after the bandit disaster, they are barely maintaining the status quo. In addition to postal and telecommunications services, long-distance buses, thanks to the Tenth Army's efforts in building roads, connect to Hankou in the east, Shashi in the west, and Qianjiang in the south, which is extremely convenient. The road from Yuekou to Qianjiang is open to traffic today. The section from Yuekou to Shashi is being rushed to be repaired and will also be directly accessible tomorrow. The reporter arrived in Yuekou last night (the 8th) and took a bus to Qianjiang this morning at 10 AM for inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Tragic Situation After the Bandit Disaster in Qianjiang <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Qianjiang is located near Honghu, bordering Tianmen and Yingcheng to the north, Mianyang to the east, and Jianli and Jiangling to the southwest. Its strategic location made it the base for bandits entrenched in Honghu to expand outwards. In August 1930, He Long led his troops into Qianjiang City, implementing communization and redistributing land, allocating two mu of land to each person. The people lived in insecurity, and much of the land was barren. Moreover, the bandits engaged in terrible burning and killing, with most of the houses in the surrounding countryside being burned and demolished. In the city, in addition to the county government, party headquarters, and churches being burned down, countless civilian houses were also destroyed. Those that were not completely destroyed had most of their doors and windows torn down. As for the residents' possessions, they were almost completely taken away. The bandits used Honghu as their base, and lacking building materials in the lake, they dismantled houses in Qianjiang and used the materials to build their bandit nests. The county government has not yet been repaired and is temporarily using a dilapidated academy as its office. The party headquarters and churches are temporarily renting civilian houses. The remaining shops and residences are repaired and occupied with reeds and mud, creating a dilapidated scene that is unbearable to witness. The bandit massacres in Qianjiang are horrific. The methods of killing are even more unexpected. In addition to beheading, the types of punishment included confiscation (a special bandit term meaning burial alive), eye gouging, military conscription, drowning, guillotine execution, sawing, and dismemberment. Those who were confiscated were secretly tied up and ordered to dig their own pits, placed upside down in the pits, and covered with soil. The families of the killed only knew that they were missing and did not know they were killed, let alone find their bodies. The number of people confiscated in the city and countryside is countless. Those who were eye-gouged had their eyes gouged out while still alive. The bandits often gouged out the eyes of their victims before executing them, and many died in this way. Military conscription involved covering the head with black cloth, leaving only the eyes exposed, so that outsiders could not recognize the true face. Those who were conscripted lightly were exiled to other places, while those who were heavily conscripted were taken to remote areas and killed. Those who were drowned were thrown into the lake, and the bandits threw stones at them from the shore until they were dead. Guillotine execution involved cutting the victim in half at the waist. Sawing involved using wooden boards to clamp the victim upright and sawing them in half from the crotch to the heel. Dismemberment involved dividing the body into several pieces after killing and scattering them in all directions. Such brutal and inhumane massacres are unheard of. The National Army and the bandits entered and exited Qianjiang more than ten times. It is estimated that over ten thousand residents were killed in the city, and even more in the surrounding countryside. It is estimated that four or five tenths of the people in the city died, and five or six tenths of the people in the surrounding countryside died. There was a female bandit named Qian Ying, originally a widow. Her family forced her to remarry, but Ying fled to Russia, embraced celibacy, and returned to China to serve as a member of the Communist Party Central Committee. She was brutal and killed countless people. This autumn, she was killed by the National Army in Zhoujiazu, and the rumor that He Long's sister, He Ying, was killed was a mistake for Qian Ying. The National Army recovered Qianjiang on July 14 this year and attacked Honghu, encircling it on all sides. As the army advanced deep, the bandits were finally wiped out. Currently, Qianjiang is garrisoned by a regiment, a security team with four detachments, totaling 446 men. The militia organization in the city and countryside is tightly organized, with a total of five districts divided into 159 brigades, 636 companies, and 1,908 squads, totaling 68,688 people. They are in close contact with each other, establishing peasant outposts and relaying urgent reports, so that news spreads quickly in the event of a bandit alarm, and they defend together. After Qianjiang was ravaged by the bandits, nine out of ten houses were empty. The people lacked food and could only eat water chestnuts, and they could not even eat their fill each day. The fields were barren, and the farmers lacked both seeds and cattle. They often had to pull iron plows with several people to work the land. After the recovery, there was no harvest in the winter, and relief was urgently needed. The Department of Civil Affairs had previously allocated 25,000 yuan, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not solve the problem. The land had been disposed of by the bandits, and the land deeds were burned. It is now being handled in accordance with the regulations for the handling of rural land in the Communist suppression area issued by the headquarters, and the results are good. As for education, there were several primary schools, but they were completely suspended after the bandit disaster and cannot be established now. There are only two private schools in the city to educate children. There is a Catholic parish in the city, presided over by Father Luo Degong. The Catholic Church originally established primary schools for boys and girls in the city, but they have not been restored since the bandit disaster. There is only a private school-style primary school. When the reporter arrived in Qianjiang at 11 AM on the 9th, the villages seen along the way were dilapidated. After entering the city, although the shops had opened, there was nothing to buy except snacks. After a short rest at the county government, I went to the parade ground to observe the militia and then inspected Shenhuotan, the site of fierce battles between the National Army and the bandits. Although the traces of the battle are no longer discernible, the remnants of the bandit's pseudo-Hunan-Hubei-West Provincial Soviet Presidium Finance Department bulletin and the Red Army soldiers and various slogans of the pseudo-Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Third Army Ninth Division remain. The bulletin of the pseudo-Finance Department, which was posted when the officers and soldiers were suppressing bandits, shows their general situation of draining the pond to catch all the fish and economic panic. Excerpts are as follows for reference: "(1) Land tax is determined according to the value of agricultural products. No tax is levied for values less than 50 yuan. From 50 yuan to 100 yuan, 1% is levied (i.e., one cent per yuan; the following applies similarly). From 100 yuan to 200 yuan, 2% is levied. From 200 yuan to 300 yuan, 3% is levied. From 300 yuan to 500 yuan, 5% is levied. From 500 yuan to 700 yuan, 7% is levied. From 700 yuan to 1,000 yuan, 10% is levied. (2) Wealthy farmers in the past are taxed double according to one standard. (3) Workers themselves are exempt from tax, but their families, parents, wives, and children are still taxed according to their harvest. (4) Red Army family members are taxed at half the rate. The families of Red soldiers who sacrificed in the revolutionary war are exempt from tax altogether. (5) (Original text incomplete) tax-exempt, but due to the current economic difficulties, it is decided to borrow half according to the standard of the Spring Committee land tax, and the borrowed funds will be repaid when taxes are collected in the autumn. (6) Taxes can be paid in both money and grain. (7) Soviet water conservancy bonds and bank banknotes must be repaid when taxes are collected in the autumn." (Issued in Yuekou on December 9)</p>

<p>Doctor's Examination Suspects Cerebral Hemorrhage</p>
<p>Guangdong Government Sends Personnel to Handle Funeral and Discuss Compensation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Zhu Zhaoxin, Diplomatic Inspector of the Five Southwest Provinces and Member of the Guangdong Provincial Government, suddenly died at home on the night of the 10th of this month after attending a naval banquet. Zhu was in good health in Japan as usual. After working, he went to dinner at the home of his friend Pan. The dinner was a snake soup feast. After the banquet, he accepted an invitation from the Navy Headquarters to attend a banquet hosted by the Guangdong Navy for British Admiral Cary. In addition to Navy Commander Zhang Zhiying, Chen Jitang, Liu Jiwen, and others were present that evening. Zhu was in high spirits and drank heartily until the banquet ended. He returned home in a drunken state. On the way, in the carriage, he suddenly felt unwell. When he arrived at his private residence on Ruixing New Street, he felt a severe headache. His family thought Zhu was drunk and gave him hangover medicine, but it was ineffective. After taking a headache remedy, he felt slightly better and rested for about half an hour. The headache became more severe, and he vomited and had diarrhea. His moans indicated he was in critical condition. The whole family was at a loss. When Chinese and Western doctors arrived, Zhu's heart had already stopped. The doctors were helpless. At approximately 2:10 AM on the morning of the 11th, Zhu's family, fearing that his sudden death was due to other causes, summoned Dr. Huang to examine the remains. It was determined that the corpse's joints were stiff and the fingernails were blue, which are inevitable conditions after death and cannot prove the cause of death. There were no other abnormalities. Considering his general symptoms after a full meal and heavy drinking, and at his age and physical condition, cerebral hemorrhage (commonly known as stroke) was the most likely cause. After Zhu's death, his family arranged for the funeral. The Provincial Government also sent personnel to assist. A coffin worth a thousand yuan has already been purchased, and the encoffining ceremony is scheduled for this morning (the 13th). It is reported that the Provincial Government will submit a proposal to the Provincial Council on the 14th to discuss generous compensation. Zhu is survived by five sons and seven daughters.</p>
<p>The eldest son graduated in England and returned to Guangdong and is already self-reliant. His mother is over seventy years old and still in good health. Zhu was frugal and left behind a modest estate. (December 13)</p>

<p>Zhu Yunsheng, a resident of Zhu Xie Lane, Kaiyuan Township, Fourth District, Wuxi County, runs an iron shop in Shanghai and is wealthy. Only his wife, children, and servants live at home. Unexpectedly, seven bandits suddenly arrived in a car the other night from the city. Four of them wore overcoats, and three wore plain clothes. They were armed with pistols, flashlights, and other weapons. They broke into the house and ordered everyone to be silent. They ransacked the house and looted two gold Buddhas, two gold ingots, and jewelry, totaling over 2,000 yuan. They abandoned the bulky clothing and did not take it. After looting, the bandits sped away in the original car towards the city. Afterwards, Zhu's wife informed Zhu Yunsheng in Shanghai by long-distance telephone and reported the matter to the County Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Dispute Over Closure of Hefeng Silk Factory <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Taifeng Silk Factory, located in Longchuanbang outside the West Gate of Wuxi, was established by Zhang Zizhen and others. This year, it was renamed Hefeng, and Zhang Zizhen became the sole proprietor and manager. Since its opening, it has never stopped operating, and business has been doing well. On the 10th of this month, the factory summoned all the foremen and indicated that it would have to stop work for three days starting on the 15th. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 15th, the factory's accountant, Zhang Zhonghou, suddenly summoned all the foremen and said that the factory was affected by the low price of silk and the lack of raw materials and had decided to temporarily close down. All employees will also be temporarily dismissed, and meals for the foremen will be provided until the 20th. Salaries will be paid until the end of the month. Upon hearing the news, the employees believed that according to the old custom, the salary for the twelfth lunar month must be doubled. Now that the factory suddenly stopped work, not only was the doubled salary hopeless, but their livelihood would also be cut off. They immediately elected representatives to request the factory three times to provide meals until the end of the year and pay salaries until March, in accordance with the company's regulations for the closure and dismissal of employees, in order to maintain the livelihood of the employees. As manager Zhang Zizhen was ill at home, Zhang Zhonghou represented him and stated that the factory was in financial difficulty and could not accept the request. The employees, driven by livelihood, had no choice but to struggle desperately. Therefore, they decided to directly request Zhang Zizhen again today and temporarily withhold the wages paid to the female workers to help supplement the funds.</p>

<p>Liu Youyu Ham Shop, which has been open for decades, is one of the best in the province. In the past, it specialized in selling to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, and other places, and business was very prosperous. In recent years, because the hams shipped to Hong Kong were deemed unsanitary and purchased from Suzhou and Hangzhou instead, sales have declined, and it has only relied on scattered wholesale and retail sales to eke out a living. The profits of the past have been exhausted, and recently it has become more and more difficult to make ends meet. Yesterday, it declared bankruptcy. It owes 4,060 taels of silver to Yuanyi Village, 1,167 taels of silver to each of Jinsheng and Tongyu, 700 taels of silver to Jishanji, about 2,000 taels of silver and 2,100 yuan of foreign currency to depositors, and over 300 taels of silver and over 1,900 yuan of foreign currency to Shanghai for goods. The total is about 19,000 yuan of foreign currency. After deducting the inventories, accounts receivable, and assets as collateral, the net loss is over 13,000 yuan.</p>

Yu Wang came to the city on the 14th to visit her relatives and hired a rickshaw in the evening to go to the station and return home. When she arrived at Wangsun Lane on the east side of the Confucian Temple, a Sichuanese bandit suddenly pressed the rickshaw down and robbed Yu Wang of the rattan bag, scarf, and other items she was carrying. At the time, the rickshaw puller did not resist at all, as if he had a tacit agreement with the bandits. After the robbery, he still forced Yu Wang to go to the station. Yu Wang cried and begged to return to her relative's house. The rickshaw returned to the Tianyitai Foreign Goods Store, where the store captured the rickshaw puller, Yi Jinbao, and sent him to the First Public Security Bureau. Yi confessed that the robber was Yang Yuqiao. On the morning of the 15th, Yang and related person Zhu Liuguanzi were captured and escorted to the county government for interrogation.</p>

<p>Resolving to Prepare Hot Blood as a Strong Backing</p>
<p>Hoping for Continued Efforts to Achieve Complete Success</p>
<p>The following seventy-plus unions from this city jointly sent a telegram of condolences to Mr. Yan, the chief representative of the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations Assembly, and representatives Gu and Guo: the cigarette industry of the four districts of this city, postal service, postal workers, shipbuilding in the first district, water and electricity in the sixth district, water and electricity in the first district, the shipbuilding and timber industries, the Hu-Yong steamer stewards, shipbuilding in the fifth district, soap and medicine in the ninth district, the prepared opium business, the woodworking in the fifth district, cotton spinning in the fifth district, civilian shipbuilding, the brewing industry, the grain measurement business, the leather manufacturing business, the sauce industry, the coal appliance business, the paper making in the first district, the cleaning in the first district, shipbuilding in the fourth district, water and electricity in the third district, the newspaper delivery business, the pharmaceutical industry, the dried goods business, the woodworking in the ninth district, the cement in the ninth district, the match industry in the fifth district, the knitting industry in the second district, the incense business, the cleaning in the fourth district, the military uniform business, the transport and lighterage in the fourth district, the machinery in the fourth district, the cotton spinning in the eighth district, the lithography business, the tea and snack business, the dyeing business, the silk finishing agency, the public bus service in the sixth district, the clothing industry, the pharmacy business, silk reeling in the fourth district, the foundry business, silk reeling in the sixth district, silk reeling in the third district, etc. The original text is as follows: "To Mr. Yan Junren, Chief Representative of the Chinese Delegation to the League of Nations Assembly in Geneva, Representative Gu Shaochuan, and Representative Guo Taiqi, We are deeply saddened that since the Japanese invaders occupied the Northeast, brutally murdered our compatriots, and burned our homes, they have gone on to recognize the puppet regime in order to realize their ambitions of aggression. Their ferocity and brutality know no bounds, disregarding international justice, and treating the League of Nations Covenant as scrap paper. The world is shocked, and people are filled with indignation. All compatriots across the country are filled with grief and indignation, vowing to fight to the death, annihilate the fierce enemy, and recover our land. Our government authorities, bearing humiliation and shouldering heavy responsibilities, hold the heartfelt desire to maintain world peace and respect the status of the League of Nations. Faced with this unreasonable aggression, they have endured with the utmost patience, bringing the Northeast issue to the League of Nations, and quietly awaiting a legal resolution and the upholding of justice. Although past League of Nations assemblies have been indecisive and procrastinated, our country's spirit of respecting the League of Nations and maintaining peace has never wavered. Since the completion of the investigation team's report and the reopening of the League of Nations Assembly, the tyrannical Japanese representatives have once again been dispatched to lobby everywhere, using their eloquent tongues to reverse right and wrong, confuse black and white, in the hope of obliterating the truth and deceiving friendly nations. At the same time, they have increased the deployment of heavy troops, suppressed the volunteer armies, and invaded the borders of Jehol, in order to threaten our country. At this time of extremely serious circumstances, fortunately, you gentlemen have not shied away from hardship, traveled far across the oceans, mediated in negotiations, proclaimed your efforts abroad, employed your powerful eloquence, exposed conspiracies, upheld our country's righteousness, and refuted fallacies. Your reasoning is straightforward and your arguments are righteous and stern. Once a word is spoken, all present are full of admiration. The Japanese representatives are all at a loss for words and arguments, their spirits deflated and their faces changed. Not only has their tyrannical behavior been somewhat restrained as a result, but also the truth of the Northeast issue and our heartfelt desire to safeguard peace have been made clear to the world. Public opinion in friendly countries has changed as a result, and the morale of our people has been greatly boosted. Your great achievements are enough to be immortalized alongside the generals Ma, Su, Ding, and Li in the Northeast. Now that the situation in the League of Nations is such that the tyrannical Japanese are devising endless schemes, coupled with the intentional bias of one or two imperialist powers, it is currently difficult to predict what good results will come of it in the future. In addition to preparing hot blood and vowing to be your strong backing, we, the people of the whole country, still hope that you will not fear violence, continue to work hard, and achieve complete success. Whether the Northeast issue can be resolved, whether a world war can be avoided, and whether international justice can be upheld all depend on this final five-minute struggle. We hope that you will strive to the utmost. The wind and snow in the vast world are severe, and we hope that you will value yourselves for the sake of the country. We offer these few words to express our appreciation for your virtuous efforts. In this telegram, we cannot express the urgency of our feelings."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Huang Boqiao Appointed Director of the Two Railways Administration <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>He Arrived at the Bureau Yesterday Afternoon to Take Over</p>
<p>Announcing the Appointments of Mo Heng and Yuan Boyang</p>
<p>As Chief and Deputy Chief of the General Affairs Department</p>
<p>After the January 28th Shanghai Incident this spring, the ineffectiveness of the responsible person at the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration led the Ministry of Railways to promote the commissioner of the bureau, Chen Xinghan, to the position of director. At that time, the traffic on the two railways was crucial for the deployment of our anti-Japanese troops and the relief of war-zone victims. Although Mr. Chen took office during this difficult time, he was able to fulfill his duties by working hard and giving directions. However, due to a lack of construction skills, there were high expectations and strict demands from all sides for the reconstruction of the two railways. Therefore, there was a growing dissatisfaction with Mr. Chen. As a result, Mr. Chen had no choice but to submit his resignation to the Ministry, which was approved yesterday by the Ministry of Railways. The current Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, Huang Boqiao, was appointed to succeed him. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Director of the Two Railways Administration, Mr. Huang Boqiao</p>
<p>(Chen's Resignation Approved) The Ministry of Railways received Mr. Chen's resignation and decided to approve it. However, there was no suitable candidate for the successor. After deliberation, it was decided to transfer the current Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, Mr. Huang Boqiao, to succeed him. The Minister Huang then sent someone to Shanghai to solicit his opinion. Mr. Huang replied that he had served in Shanghai for a long time, and various construction projects were just beginning to take shape. If Mayor Wu did not agree, he would not be willing to leave his original post. Upon receiving the report, Minister Gu took advantage of Mayor Wu's trip to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee to solicit his opinion in person. It was then decided to jointly send a telegram to Shanghai summoning Mr. Huang to Beijing.</p>
<p>(Mr. Huang Goes to Beijing) After receiving the telegram, Mr. Huang went to Beijing on the 14th to meet with Minister Gu and Mayor Wu. Minister Gu stated that Director Huang was known for his capable handling of affairs and was praised by all parties. Moreover, the reconstruction of the two railways and the construction of the new station were not only major responsibilities but also had a significant relationship with the implementation of the Greater Shanghai Plan. Mayor Wu immediately expressed his approval, and Mr. Huang also agreed. The Ministry of Railways also added a deputy director position due to the complexity and importance of the two railways affairs, appointing Wu Shaozeng to the post. After receiving the order, Mr. Huang returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, first going to the Public Utilities Bureau to make arrangements for the handover.</p>
<p>(Arrived at the Bureau Yesterday Afternoon) At 3 p.m., the two directors, Huang and Wu, along with Mo Heng, the former chief of the Fourth Section of the Public Utilities Bureau, and Yuan Boyang, the chief of the First Section, went to the Two Railways Administration to take over. Chen Xinghan first gathered all the staff to introduce the new directors and delivered a speech. After the meeting, former Director Chen assigned the Chief of the General Affairs Department, Kaihua, to handle the handover, clarifying all the files and documents of the General Affairs Department. The new director then announced the appointments of Mo Heng as the Chief of the General Affairs Department and Yuan Boyang as the Deputy Chief. The remaining staff were not changed. After completing the handover, Director Huang left the bureau at around 5 p.m. and returned to his residence.</p>
<p>(Key Points of the Speech) After arriving at the bureau, Director Huang delivered a speech to all the staff, briefly stating that although he had firmly declined, Minister Gu had entrusted him with the position of Director of the bureau, which was not approved. He was here today to take office and would work hard to serve and live up to the expectations of the people and Minister Gu. There were four key points: 1. The advancement and demotion of the bureau's staff would be based entirely on their performance, so please work with peace of mind. 2. The establishment of railway facilities should be based on public opinion. 3. The transportation of the railway should strive to increase efficiency to the highest possible degree. 4. The construction of the new station should be carried out in cooperation with the Shanghai Municipal Government, so that it can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(Background of Huang and Wu) Huang Boqiao is 43 years old, a native of Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, and a graduate of the first class of the Mechanical Engineering Department of Tongji Medical and Engineering University in Shanghai. He studied at the Berlin University of Technology in Germany and served as the chief of the General Affairs Section of the Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications in Beijing, a member of the Railway Dictionary Revision Committee of the Ministry of Communications, the chief of the General Affairs Department of the Bian-Luo Road of the Longhai Railway, the director of the Public Works Bureau of Hankou City, the director of the Public Works Bureau of Hangzhou City, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Government, the chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Engineering Society, and a director of the Chinese Institute of Engineers. He represented the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou municipal governments, the Construction Committee, and the Chinese Engineering Society at the Second World Power Conference held in Berlin, Germany. Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng is a commissioner of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways and is experienced in railway construction and transportation. He has been instrumental in the implementation of responsible transportation on various railways recently.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Xu Peihuang Concurrently Serves as Director of the Public Utilities Bureau <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>He Took Over Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Boqiao, the Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau of this city, has served for several years and has made remarkable achievements. This time, with the approval of the resignation of Chen Xinghan, the Director of the Two Railways Administration, the Ministry of Railways appointed Huang Boqiao to succeed him as the Director of the Two Railways Administration. The vacancy left by the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Utilities Bureau was temporarily filled by Mr. Xu Peihuang, a commissioner of the Municipal Government. The details of Mr. Xu's takeover yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>(Brief Biography of Mr. Xu) Mr. Xu is a native of Wujiang, Jiangsu Province. After graduating from Nanyang Public School in Shanghai, he studied engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the United States. After returning to China, he served as an engineer at Wu Zhou Pharmacy, the chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, a counselor of the Municipal Government, the director of the Education Bureau, and a commissioner of the Municipal Government. He is quite familiar with the situation in this city.</p>
<p>(Takeover Situation) After receiving the appointment order yesterday, Mr. Xu, accompanied by the former director, Huang Boqiao, went to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau in the afternoon to take over. First, he gathered all the staff in the auditorium, where former Director Huang introduced them one by one. Then, Mr. Xu addressed all the staff, briefly stating that he had been ordered to concurrently serve as the director, and since he had had many opportunities to meet with everyone in the past, they were all very familiar with each other. He deeply admired the past situation of the bureau, which was due to the strong leadership of Director Huang, but the dedicated service of everyone was also a major reason. He hoped that everyone could assist him with the same spirit as they had assisted Director Huang in the past, so that the bureau's affairs could continue to develop, and so on. After the speech, he went to the director's office and talked briefly with the key staff of the bureau. Because the Municipal Government still had a meeting, he left the bureau at around 3 p.m. and returned to the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>(Issuing a Public Notice) After taking office, Director Xu issued a public notice that read: "For the purpose of issuing a public notice, according to the Municipal Government's Instruction No. 368, Mr. Xu Peihuang, a commissioner of this government, is hereby assigned to the post. It is hereby ordered that Huang Boqiao, the Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau of this city, has been appointed by the Ministry of Railways as the Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways.</p>
<p>Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Xu Peihuang</p>
<p>The vacancy left by the director of the bureau is now temporarily filled by the commissioner. In addition to issuing separate orders to the Public Utilities Bureau, this order is hereby issued to the aforementioned official for immediate compliance, to take over and report to the authorities on the same day. This order, etc. The director of this bureau immediately took over on the afternoon of December 16th, except for reporting and issuing separately, and also issued a public notice to inform all. This notice."</p>
<p>(Director's Talk) Director Xu told a Central News Agency reporter at the Municipal Government that he had gone to the bureau this afternoon (i.e., yesterday) to take over. Since he was just taking over, he did not want to express any opinions on the future business of the bureau. As for the staff, he only brought one secretary when he took over the Education Bureau the year before, and now he did not bring anyone, because he did not want to make any changes to the original staff.</p>
<p>Xu Took a Train to Beijing Last Night to Meet with Mayor Wu to Report on the Matter</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Supports Increasing the Bond Fund <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Key Points of Mr. Zhou's Proposal</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram yesterday supporting the proposal to increase the bond fund. The original text of the telegram reads: "To the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee in Nanjing, we are delighted to read that Committee Member Zhou Fohai and others have proposed to increase the bond fund and repay the principal in advance. The reduction of interest rates and the extension of the term of bonds were originally intended to help the government overcome difficulties during the national crisis by bondholders. However, since its implementation, bond prices have fallen, the financial market has been affected, and the commercial economy has been hindered. Now that the Plenary Session has opened, the government is making efforts to build a new vision, and the restoration of social finance must be the first step. Only then will there be a way to utilize private capital. We respectfully request that the Plenary Session pass the aforementioned proposal and hand it over to the National Government for prompt implementation, so as to show the people the way to trust them while taking into account both the national economy and the people's livelihood. We cannot help but anxiously hope for this in our telegram, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that Mr. Zhou Fohai, the original proposer, said that the key points of the proposal were as follows: "Since the establishment of the country, a large amount of public debt and treasury bonds has been issued. The people's support for the government is undeniable. The fund used by the government to guarantee the repayment of principal and interest is also reliable, which enables it to repay principal and interest on time and maintain stable credit. Therefore, the bond price has often been around 70% to 80% of its face value. However, since the Liaoning Incident, bond prices have plummeted, and the market has been shaken. Both finance and economy have suffered. After the Shanghai Incident, financial stagnation and social exhaustion occurred, and the bond market fell to a new low. Fortunately, the bondholders understood the situation and negotiated with the government to reduce the interest rate of various public debt and treasury bonds and extend the repayment period in order to slightly reduce the financial pressure of the government and maintain bond credit. The people's solidarity with the country is commendable. However, for the government, this is ultimately an expedient measure and cannot be regarded as a permanent rule. Moreover, the people's concept of credit for national public debt has not been restored. This can be seen from the fact that the circulation price of bonds has not recovered to its old value in recent months. If people do not develop a deep sense of trust in the country and the government, then at a time when this new country is being built, post-disaster relief in the communist areas, reconstruction of the war zones, and countless problems all require funds. What can the government rely on to regulate these funds? For the sake of cultivating the people's trust in the country and for the sake of the government's future construction, a more favorable method should be adopted for the repayment of principal and interest of the public debt and treasury bonds that have been issued. According to the case of revising the schedule of repayment of principal and interest of public debt and treasury bonds in January of this year, although the National Government has clearly ordered it to be finalized and not to be changed again, the so-called no more changes refers to the fact that the fund must not be shaken in the slightest. If the government increases the fund outside the original fund and repays the principal in advance, it will not conflict with the original plan. It is specially proposed that the National Government of our country should take advantage of this opportunity to move back to the capital and start anew with the people. As the political situation is gradually stabilizing and tax revenue is gradually improving, the government should automatically increase the monthly allocation of the bond principal and interest fund from January of the 21st year of the Republic of China by three to four million yuan on top of the original allocation of half of the fund of 8.6 million yuan. For bond repayment, the method specified when the bonds were issued should be fully restored, and the term should no longer be extended. While it may seem that the government is allocating more funds and the finances may be affected, the organs may need to be streamlined, the financial market will benefit greatly from the people's perspective, and the concept of the government's maintenance of debt credit will be more firmly established as a result. The willingness to cooperate with the government will also be more practical as a result."</p>

<h3 id="e124">General Manager Li Takes Office <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Discusses the Importance of Opening the Northwest Route</p>
<p>Returned to Beijing Last Night to Report Details</p>
<p>The Ri Ri News Agency reported that the board of directors of Eurasia Aviation Corporation appointed Li Jingcong, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, as the general manager of the company on the 14th of this month. Li took office at the company at 9 a.m. yesterday and telegraphed the Ministry of Communications and notified all stations. A Ri Ri News Agency reporter visited Li yesterday morning, who gave a detailed account of the reasons for the reorganization and the difficulties and importance of opening the Northwest Route. The following is a record of Li's remarks:</p>
<p>(Reasons for Reorganization) "I (Li referred to himself) originally served as the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Communications, and my affairs were very busy. I was unable to take care of the company's affairs. However, the former General Manager Wang Zhiyuan was unable to serve concurrently due to the heavy responsibilities of the Northeast National Salvation Army. He earnestly resigned, and Minister Zhu Jiahua had no choice but to have me take over. I took over today (yesterday). The Eurasia Northwest Route is not only closely related to the development of the Northwest but also has great value internationally. I deeply hope that all sectors will provide assistance so that it can continue to develop."</p>
<p>(Difficulties in Opening the Route) "The Eurasia Northwest Route was originally scheduled to officially open on the 15th, but the opening was postponed by one day due to a slight obstruction of the aircraft's parts during takeoff. It officially opened today (yesterday). However, although it has now opened, there are still many difficulties. The more important ones are listed as follows: 1. Regarding aircraft parts, the company's aircraft parts were not very numerous to begin with. In addition, there have been damages in recent months, and the remaining parts are extremely limited. For this route, which makes round trips of approximately 10,000 kilometers per week, even if there are no obstacles along the way, the allocation is difficult, and new aircraft parts cannot be delivered until February of next year at the earliest. This is the first difficulty. 2. Regarding ground equipment, the climate in the Northwest is severely cold, and it is already cool in October. In this environment, it is difficult to fly on schedule without sheds, houses, and heating equipment. These have not been considered in the past few months, and it is impossible to build them now. Other equipment such as wireless weather instruments are also very important for flight, but they have not been prepared, and there is no way to purchase them locally because the supply is not meeting demand. They can only be gradually transported and arranged. This is the second difficulty. 3. Regarding personnel, the company specializes in air transportation and is jointly operated by China and Germany. All German technicians have been in China for less than two years and cannot be expected to be fluent in Chinese. Therefore, in order to ensure smooth operation and convenient management, senior Chinese officials should be those who have aviation and business knowledge and are also fluent in German. It is already not easy to find such people, and the general mentality of the Chinese people is that they view the Northwest as a long distance.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Most people are afraid to go. In fact, the resources in the Northwest are far richer than those in the inland provinces, and the climate is drier than that in the Jiangnan area. Moreover, the company is developing air transportation, and although the Northwest is tens of thousands of miles away, the round-trip flight in the future will only take three to four days. However, even after explaining this to these talents, they still have difficulties. This is another difficulty. As for the storage and transportation of gasoline and the construction of airports along the way, I ordered the company to handle them separately or entrusted them to local officials when I test-flew to Xinjiang last year, so they are no longer a problem. In short, no matter how difficult it is, I will try to make it perfect in the shortest possible time, so as to live up to the expectations of Minister Zhu and the people of the society."</p>
<p>(Importance of Opening the Route) "After the entire Northwest Route is completed, all mail to Europe can be transported by the company's aircraft to Tacheng on the Sino-Russian border and transferred to the Siberian Railway, arriving in Europe in 13 to 14 days. Now that China and Russia have restored diplomatic relations, it is easier to proceed with the method of flying directly to Europe. In the future, Eurasia airmail will only take five to six days to transport, and the government's original goal of blocking Northeast postal services can also be completely achieved. Once all facilities are in place, I plan to fly to Russia in person to discuss with the Russian authorities the specific methods for the company's aircraft to transport mail through Russian territory and fly to Europe, or to temporarily use aircraft for intermodal transport on the Sino-Russian border, etc."</p>
<p>(Telegraph to the Ministry of Communications) After taking office yesterday, Li telegraphed the Ministry of Communications separately and notified all aircraft stations. The original text is extracted below: 1. "Respectfully submit that the board of directors of Eurasia Aviation Corporation has decided to appoint Jingcong as the vice chairman of Eurasia Aviation Corporation and to appoint him as the general manager by the chairman of the board. With this approval, Jingcong took office at the company on December 16th and is reporting to the Ministry for review and filing. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Communications. 2. "To Minister Zhu and Vice Minister Yu Zhang of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, Jingcong has been appointed by the board of directors of Eurasia Aviation Corporation as the vice chairman and general manager of the company. He will take office at the company today. This is hereby reported by telegram. Li Jingcong, General Manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation."</p>
<p>(Notice to All Stations) "To the stationmaster, the board of directors of Eurasia Aviation Corporation has decided to appoint Jingcong as the vice chairman of Eurasia Aviation Corporation and to appoint him as the general manager by the chairman of the board. With this approval, Jingcong took office at the company on December 16th. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Communications and sending separate letters, this letter is hereby sent for your information."</p>
<p>(Returned to Beijing Last Night) After Li took office at the company yesterday morning, he reported the official opening of the Northwest Route to Minister of Communications Zhu Jiahua and took the night express train to Beijing at 11:45 last night to report everything in person and handle official business in the ministry. It is said that Li will return to Shanghai in three or four days.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Current Situation of Russian Goods in China <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>There are almost no overall statistics on the trade of Russian goods in China. According to Russian merchants, after the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, maritime transportation was suspended, and transportation relied on foreign mail ships, with high freight rates. Therefore, the trade in China has declined year by year in the past five years. The main goods transported to China are kerosene and cloth, but due to the reliance on foreign transportation, it is difficult to compete with other countries. Now that diplomatic relations have been restored and sea routes have been opened, Russian goods will definitely be able to seize the labor of Japanese goods in China.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Shanghai Merchants Plan to Order Russian Goods <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Russia's industrial and commercial development surpasses that of any other country. Moreover, its goods are abundant, leading to low prices, even lower than those of Japanese goods, which are known for their cheapness. Now that China and Russia have resumed diplomatic relations, Russian merchants are planning to restore shipping services to facilitate transportation. Since the movement to boycott foreign goods, local Shanghai merchants have been actively promoting domestic products. To replace the goods that domestic production lacks, they are now planning to order Russian goods. It is said that some local merchants have already begun negotiating with Russian merchants to place orders.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Restoration of Consulate Awaits <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Since the severance of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, Russian expatriates in China have been managed by German consulates on behalf of the Soviet Russian government. However, according to information from the German consulate, they were never entrusted by the Soviet Russian government to manage Russian expatriates in Shanghai. They were only entrusted to manage the Russian Consulate General building at No. 1 on the Bund. Furthermore, that building was returned to the Russian side for self-management last year. Therefore, the restoration of the Russian Consulate General will likely occur after the appointment of consular personnel.</p>
<p>Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Public Bonds</p>
<h3 id="e131">Issuance Commenced Yesterday <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>To rescue the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the Ministry of Finance issued public bonds totaling 3 million yuan. The regulations and subsidy measures have been announced. These public bonds are now held by the Fund Custody Committee. The joint office organized by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Stored Silk Promotion Committee and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Stored Silk and Cocoon Organization Committee officially started operations yesterday. Any stored silk from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces that has been registered and qualified for export by the organization committee can, starting yesterday, be presented to the Promotion Committee along with the stored silk export permit and public quantity sheet to obtain a registration certificate. After obtaining the registration certificate, a subsidy voucher can be obtained from the Organization Committee, and then presented to the Fund Custody Committee to collect the first installment of principal after a lottery draw.</p>

<p>Dutch Consulate Lodges Protest</p>
<p>Municipal Government Immediately Rejects</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Dutch Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Herlongmen, protested to the Municipal Government regarding the arrest and detention by the Municipal Public Security Bureau of two students from Jinan University in Zhenru, Wen Dabi and Zhang Qicai, on suspicion of being communists. Wen and Zhang have lived in Dutch-controlled Java in the South Seas since childhood. The Consul requested their release. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun received him and explained that although Wen and Zhang hold Dutch nationality, they had not reported it to China and had not been permitted to renounce their Chinese citizenship. Therefore, there was no basis for handling the matter, especially since it occurred within China. The Dutch Consul left without achieving his objective.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Northern Wharf of China Merchants Bureau Not Interrupted <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Talk by Liu Hongsheng</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, told a Central News Agency reporter yesterday that reports stating that workers at the Northern Wharf had resumed work today (i.e., yesterday) were completely untrue. There had never been a strike by workers at the Northern Wharf. Although the workers from the five wharves had petitioned the Bureau to withdraw the order due to the He (Tiehua) issue, after explanation, they understood and returned to work. He Tiehua has also resumed his duties, and all employees are working as usual without interruption. According to reports yesterday, the wharf handled over 150 pieces of cargo. This proves that the strike rumors are completely false. The current unrest is likely due to a few employees who feared being laid off and incited others. The Bureau does not attach much importance to this. Regarding the Chinese wharves, the monthly salary for staff at this wharf was 798 yuan in the same month of the 17th year of the Republic. This month, it has gradually increased to 2,570 yuan, more than tripling in four years. However, the income in the last two years is only 4,300 taels, and the official interest and depreciation of assets are not included. If calculated in silver dollars, 4,000 taels is approximately 6,000 yuan, which is only enough to pay salaries for six months. This phenomenon is astonishing. The past corruption of the China Merchants Bureau can be seen from this. Regarding the overall reorganization plan, although it cannot be drafted in a short time, the accumulated problems in various parts must be rectified at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Public Prosecution by Local Court Against Chen and Li in Original Text <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The embezzlement and loan case of the China Merchants Bureau has been publicly prosecuted by the Local Court Prosecutors Ouyang Shu and Xie Lian. The original text of the indictment is recorded below:</p>
<p>Defendant Chen Fumu, male, age unknown, from Guangdong, whereabouts unknown, former Deputy Minister of Transportation and Supervisor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau; Li Guojie, male, 52 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, resident at 1050 Avenue Joffre, former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau. The aforementioned defendants are accused of dereliction of duty and breach of trust in Case No. 4671 (Xin Zi) of the 21st year of the Republic of China. The investigation has been completed according to law and the prosecution believes that the case warrants public prosecution. The facts of the defendants' crimes and the applicable legal provisions are listed below:</p>
<p>Defendant Chen Fumu, while serving as Deputy Minister of Transportation and Supervisor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau, and Defendant Li Guojie, while serving as Chairman and General Manager, with the Bureau being privately owned but state-operated, allegedly used the name of revitalizing the business to mortgage and lease the Bureau's real estate and docks located in Shanghai to the American China Business Corporation on September 5th and 6th of this year, at an interest rate of nine percent per month, borrowing 20 million Shanghai taels of silver (after deducting 15% discount and 2.5% commission, each 10 million taels was only 8.25 million). They also signed a three-wharf lease and a memorandum for the purchase of ships on credit, resulting in significant losses of shipping rights and assets. After signing, they submitted the documents to the Supervisory Office for stamping. Chen Fumu took the opportunity to solicit bribes and withheld the documents, neither issuing them nor submitting them to the Ministry for approval. Li Guojie then negotiated with the China Business Corporation to advance 700,000 taels of silver, sending Bao Yaoting to the China Merchants Bureau office at 3 PM on September 23rd of the same year, to deliver the funds to Li Guojie. Li Guojie issued a receipt with the Bureau's seal and handed it to Huang Jusu, Chen Fumu's representative, who then returned the stamped contracts and other documents to Li Guojie, who passed them on to Bao Yaoting. Li Guojie confessed to the Ministry of Transportation on December 13th of this year, and the investigation confirmed the facts. The aforementioned facts are based on the following evidence: (1) Loan contracts, mortgage deeds, leases, and memoranda; (2) China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau receipt for 700,000 taels advanced by the China Business Corporation; (3) Confession of Li Guojie; (4) Statement of Bao Yaoting that at 3-4 PM on September 23rd of this year, the General Manager of the American China Business Corporation told me to deliver 700,000 taels to the China Merchants Bureau, including 150,000 taels converted into silver dollars, personally handed them to Li Guojie, obtained a receipt, and Li Guojie gave me a large package of contracts to take back to the company, which matches Li Guojie's account of the amounts of silver and silver dollars and the simultaneous exchange of contracts; (5) Testimony of Qu Shuyou and Yao Dekui stating that No. 28 Meiliyuan is Chen Fumu's family residence, with no one else living there. He has a wife and children, but we don't know their names; Investigation of Jin Cheng, Shanghai Zhong Fu, and San Xing Bank accounts shows that on September 24th and 26th of this year, new accounts were opened under the names of Chen Zesheng, Chen Shaode, and Ms. Wei Houming, depositing a total of 200,000 taels of silver, which were part of the 700,000 taels advanced by the American China Business Corporation to Li Guojie. The addresses of the account holders are all No. 28 Meiliyuan on Daxilu. Since that address is Chen Fumu's family residence, Chen Zesheng and others are undoubtedly aliases of Chen Fumu; (6) Of the 700,000 taels of silver advanced by the American China Business Corporation to Li Guojie, in addition to the aforementioned 200,000 taels transferred through the Postal Savings Bureau and the four-bank reserve, the remaining 400,000 taels were deposited in the names of Huang Zhengde at the Shanghai Bank (100,000 taels), Huang Weiru at the Jing'an Temple branch of the Shanghai Bank (100,000 taels), Feng Duanyi at the Shanghai Bank (50,000 taels), Huang Dade at the Hongkou branch of the Bank of China (50,000 taels), Feng Shuyan at the Bank of China (50,000 taels), and Huang Zhongde at the Zhong Fu Bank (50,000 taels) (all confirmed by official inquiries). After summoning the account holders Huang Zhengde and others to their registered addresses, none of them were found, indicating that they are all aliases of Chen Fumu. In summary, the defendants Chen Fumu and Li Guojie, as public officials, had the responsibility to manage and operate the China Merchants Steam Navigation Bureau. They regrettably signed contracts that harmed shipping rights and damaged the Bureau's assets, clearly constituting dereliction of duty and breach of trust, unlawfully causing damage to the China Merchants Bureau, jointly violating Article 366, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, and should be punished according to Articles 140 and 42 of the same law. Chen Fumu accepted bribes and failed to submit the signed contracts to the Ministry for approval, clearly violating his duties, violating Article 129, Paragraph 2 of the same law, and should be punished according to Paragraph 4 of the same article and Article 70 of the same law. Li Guojie, for paying bribes to a public official who violated his duties, also violated Paragraph 3 of the same article, and confessed his crime, so he should also be punished according to Articles 74, 70, and 38, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Therefore, in accordance with Article 253, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, prosecution is initiated and the case is submitted for trial. To the Criminal Division of this Court. Prosecutors Ouyang Shu and Xie Lian, December 10, 21st year of the Republic of China. This is a true copy, certified to be identical to the original. Clerk Wang Shanxiang.</p>

<p>Furlon Factory Starts Work, Hong Lun Factory Prepares</p>
<p>India Sales Improve, Inventory Decreases</p>
<p>Of the original seven double palace silk factories in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, including Furlon in Shanghai, all but Furlon and Hong Lun had been forced to suspend operations successively due to the severe decline in the European and American double palace silk market. In October of this year, due to the complete lack of transactions in the European and American double palace silk market, exports of double palace silk disappeared and inventory piled up. To avoid significant losses, operations were temporarily suspended to await an opportunity. Recently, although the European and American double palace silk market remains unattended, sales in India are still strong. To maintain the livelihoods of workers, the Furlon factory at the end of Tianbao Road, with 216 machines and about 380 female workers, managed by Shen Zupei, resumed operations yesterday. As for the Hong Lun factory on Liuying Road, with 204 machines and about 350 female workers, managed by Fei Yangzhi, it has already organized its machinery and is preparing to resume operations the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Pudong Association has sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government regarding the additional two yuan grain tax this year. Excerpts are as follows: (1) To Minister Song Jian of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: The Jiangsu provincial grain tax, with an additional two yuan per picul, was ordered by your department to be exempt from the 21st year of the Republic of China. However, this year's grain tax still has an additional two yuan, disregarding the department's order and disregarding the people's sentiments. This greatly harms the government's integrity. Please order the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance to immediately cancel the tax and instruct all counties to stop collecting it. We are most grateful. Pudong Association: Du Yong, Cheng Xiangyue, Huang Yanpei, Shen Canlian, Lu Yuequan. (2) To Chairman Gu Jian of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang: The Jiangsu provincial grain tax, with an additional two yuan per picul, was ordered by the Ministry of Finance in June of this year to be exempt from the 21st year of the Republic of China. However, the Department of Finance disregards the Ministry's order and still instructs to collect the additional tax. This undermines credibility and burdens the people. In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Finance, please strictly order the Department of Finance to immediately instruct all counties to stop collecting the tax.

They should not be sold off at will, violating religious beliefs and local customs. Protection should be granted to preserve the scenic spot. We hereby attach the original memorial and telegram to you for review and implementation." Signed, Jiang Zhongzheng.</p>

<p>Since Wusong was hit by the disaster, the streetlights have not been restored, turning it into a dark world at night. Businesses close early, severely impacting the recovery of the war zone. After the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant took over the Baoming Company, the lines have been installed and electricity will be supplied to customers soon. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has restored the Wusong Streetlight Management Office first and dispatched workers to actively install streetlights. As of yesterday, the main roads, such as Waitma Road and Songxing Road, are completely lit up. The current lights are even brighter than before, so there is a slight night market in Songzhen these days. Branch roads and remote areas are also being installed and will be completed soon.</p>
<p>The Tragic Plight of a Ten-Year-Old Girl</p>
<h3 id="e143">Only Two Meals a Day <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Beaten While Moping</p>
<p>The Lin Couple with Bad Hearts</p>
<p>Luckily the Benevolent Child Rescue Society Reports</p>
<p>Wang Azhen Finally Escapes from the Pit</p>
<p>The China Benevolent Relief Society at No. 20 Museum Road, founded by former Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi, and the Benevolent Child Education Institute, founded by Mrs. Kong at No. 93 Huishan Road, are dedicated to rescuing and educating impoverished children without resources, so that they can increase their knowledge and avoid falling into crime in the future. The morning before yesterday, the Relief Society received a phone report stating that a girl at No. 714 Meifuli, Parker Road, was being cruelly treated by her master and was suffering terribly. The Relief Society sent representatives Zhang Yueru and Ding Bingnan to report to the Xinzha Police Station around 1:00 PM in the afternoon. They cooperated with Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate and found that the front building of the house was occupied by Ling Yongyun (Lin Yongyong) from Suzhou. Lin is an actor in the rooftop garden theater of the New World Company, with a wife, five concubines, and three daughters. His wife is also an actress. In March of this year, he bought a local girl named Wang Azhen, 12 years old, for 110 yuan to be his adopted daughter. Because the children usually did things badly, Lin beat her face with a wooden ruler, causing serious injuries. The girl was seen wearing ragged clothes and looking emaciated. After investigation, the Chinese and foreign detectives confirmed the facts and took Lin Yongyong and Wang Azhen to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the case, saying that the defendant was being prosecuted for the crime of interfering with the family under Article 257 of the Criminal Law. After investigation, the Relief Society representative Zhang Yueru filed a complaint, reporting the situation to the police after receiving a phone report. Wang Azhen testified that she was a Shanghai native, 12 years old. She was sold to the defendant as a servant this year by her mother. The defendant often abused her because she did things badly, hitting her face with a wooden ruler. She was not given enough food and had to eat alone. She only ate twice a day and was responsible for pouring water and scrubbing the floor. She only called the defendant couple "Dad" and "Mom". Her other testimony was evasive. The defendant testified that he was an actor at the Xinxin Company Xing Garden. His wife is also an actress. Recently, she became ill and is about to give birth, so she is resting at home. He has one son and three daughters. His son, Dan Sheng, is 12 years old and is currently attending school. He bought Wang Azhen for 120 yuan to be his adopted daughter, intending to marry her to his son Dan Sheng in the future. Wang's father is named Lao Zhang, and he used to be a tea server at the Great World. He met Lao Zhang when he was acting at the Great World. In March of this year, Lao Zhang's home in Zhabei was destroyed by Japanese artillery fire, and his entire family was destroyed. He cried and asked for help, so he paid 120 yuan to buy his daughter Azhen as an adopted daughter. Lao Zhang has now returned to his ancestral home in Anhui and cannot be found. He admitted that he did beat Azhen twice, but he did not know the family rules and violated the law.</p>
<p>And in recent years, the cost of living has been increasing, and the monthly income is limited, so they only rent one front room. They also only eat twice a day. He and his wife eat first, and Azhen and his children eat later. There was really no case of not giving her enough to eat or using her as a servant. He hired Shen Xingxia as a lawyer to defend him, arguing that Lin had a long-term contract with the New World Company, and both parties would suffer if he was detained. Therefore, he requested to be released on bail. Judge Wu Tingqi reviewed the testimony and found that further investigation was necessary. He ordered the defendant to be detained and Wang Azhen to be sent to the Benevolent Child Education Institute for care after a forensic examination. The case was rescheduled for further hearing on the morning of the 19th.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Large Gang of Thieves Plot to Enter Concession <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Preemptively Detected by Police</p>
<p>Sixteen Bandits Captured</p>
<p>Huatarn Shangwu of the Hui Police Station recently learned that a large gang of thieves was plotting illegal activities in the concession. He also learned that several thieves would cross from Zhabei to the concession to meet the gang. He reported to the police chief and cooperated with Huatarn Feng Baishun, Zhu Jiuhuang, Botarn Yao Changmin, Gao Yuqing, and Westartns Zha Xu and Heit, secretly guarding the wharf near Yichang Road on Tokyo Road in West Shanghai at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. Soon, the bandits Zhou Kaizhang, Wu Jingan, and Hu Dexiang from Jiangbei arrived on a ferry from Zhabei. They were arrested as they disembarked. They then joined forces with detectives from the Zhabei Public Security Bureau to capture Zhang Jinshan, Xu Zijun, Li Zhaoyou, the woman Peng Xiaoyatou, and Peng Daishi on a small boat in Tanzewan. A pistol with six bullets was found on the boat, and another pistol was found in Peng Xiaoyatou's crotch. They went to a straw shed on Hutai Road and arrested accomplices Li Qianying, Zhao Yexing, Zhang Changgeng, Li Chang, Wang Fuzhi, and the woman Wang Tangshi. Finally, they went to No. 24 Yonghefang, Zhongshan Road, and arrested Yang Mingsheng and the woman Yang Xiangshi. In total, sixteen male and female bandits were arrested. One pistol, six bullets, and two cartridge boxes were seized. All were taken back to the Hui Police Station and detained separately. Yesterday morning,</p>
<p>they were sent to the First Special District Court's One-Trial Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the circumstances of the arrest, saying that there were still accomplices and they were still being pursued. Therefore, he requested that all the defendants be detained to facilitate the police investigation. After Judge Wu Tingqi briefly questioned each of the individuals, he approved the detention for seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Are Only Five Years Apart <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>An Extremely Modern Girl Suspected</p>
<p>Family History is Also Untrue and Incomplete</p>
<p>Yesterday at 11:30 AM, two young women with alluring looks and modern attire hired a rowboat at the Guangdong Road pier to cross to Pudong. Liu Desheng and Dong Zhanwen happened to see them at the pier and immediately reported it to Water Police No. 85, Shui Hua, who was patrolling the Pudong bank. The two women were taken to the Customs Water Police Station. According to Liu and Dong, the two women were related as mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, the wife and daughter-in-law of their friend Shao Changming, who had both eloped without a trace in April of this year. They were spotted today, and they requested temporary detention so that the Shao father and son could be notified to come and identify them. Upon questioning, the two women stated that one was Zhang Ying, 23 years old from Yixing, who worked as a female supervisor (commonly known as "number one woman") at the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Mill in Yangshupu. The other was Wang Xiuzhen, 18 years old from Wuxi, also a female worker at the same factory. They became acquainted because of this. The police officers, based on the statements, found it hard to believe that there would only be a five-year age difference between a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. They immediately sent for the Shao father and son to come to the station for interrogation. At that time, Liu and Dong had already brought Shao Changming and his son Xueying together to the station. Changming stated that he was 46 years old, from Shandong, and formerly served as a patrol officer in the Fourth District Police Station of Zhabei, but was currently unemployed. The defendant, Zhang Ying, was his second wife, and he had a marriage certificate to prove it. He presented the certificate, but the police officers found that it was not stamped, making it difficult to believe. Xueying stated that he was 22 years old and currently a police officer in the Second Station of the Fourth District of Zhabei. Wang Xiuzhen was his wife, and he had a marriage certificate to prove it, but the certificate had been torn up by Xiuzhen and could not be presented. The father and son both claimed that the two defendants had run away from their husbands and requested to take them home for reunion. The police station then questioned Zhang Ying about whether she had a marital relationship with Shao Changming. She replied that she had cohabitated with him for a long time but had now separated from him. Wang Xiuzhen claimed that she did not know Shao Xueying and could not be considered Shao Changming's daughter-in-law. The police station, finding conflicting statements from both parties, decided to transfer the four men and women, along with Liu and Dong who reported them, to the District Court for trial.</p>

<p>For a Year, the Deceased's Grievance Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>The Capture of the Murderer Resembles a Myth</p>
<p>Peng Xigen, a tailor from Pengjia Pond, South of Hongqiao Town in Shanghai West, delivered clothes he had made to Tao Sanhai, who worked as a tea vendor in Tao Geng Alley, on the evening of January 2nd of this year. Tao Sanhai had just returned home from outside and mistakenly thought Peng was harassing his wife. He then colluded with neighbors Tao Axin, Tao Haigen, Tao Jigen, and his wife's brother Xu Haigen to beat Peng Xigen to death on the spot. After the incident, the murderers all fled. Only two suspects, Tao Yansheng and Tao Fengxiang, were apprehended. The deceased's father, Peng Huisheng, repeatedly petitioned the court to strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice, but Tao Sanhai and his wife remained at large and had not been caught. Unexpectedly, the deceased's younger brother, Peng Zhongbao (23 years old), somehow completely removed his upper body clothing, running around wildly and appearing insane. Huisheng and his wife tried to dissuade him, but Zhongbao sternly rebuked them, saying, "My grievance has been in the underworld for nearly a year. You have not been able to seek justice for me, yet you try to stop me? Now I have found the murderer. My brother can quickly arrest him to prevent his escape!" After speaking, he ran outside, all the way to Zhangjia Bang, west of Caohejing, where he saw Tao Axin fishing in the river. Zhongbao threw himself into the river and captured Axin, then dragged him to the Hongqiao Town Police Station under their jurisdiction, and then transferred him to the First Branch of the Sixth District. After preliminary investigation by Chief Bi, Tao Axin confessed without denial to beating Peng Xigen to death. Chief Bi obtained the confession and prepared a document to transfer the case to the court for trial.</p>
<p>The Thief's Skills are Truly Great</p>
<h3 id="e147">Walking on Rooftops as if Flying <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Able to Leap from Utility Poles to Rooftops</p>
<p>The Homes Stolen From Cannot Be Remembered</p>
<p>The master thief Hu Afu, usually in the dead of night, specialized in scaling utility poles in the British and French Concessions, leaping onto rooftops, walking as if flying, and sneaking into people's homes to steal valuables. The victims were too numerous to count. The French police detective Li Liansheng, deputy detective Lu Jinlai, and detectives Chen Yulin and Xu Wensheng discovered that Hu was hiding in No. 6 Songgui Lane, Eight Immortals Bridge, and immediately arrested him. They then successively apprehended his accomplices Li Zhangshi and Li Agen, etc., and brought them to the police station. They confessed to successively stealing from the Jinma family at No. 39 Ximen Road, the Li Jiansheng family at No. 9 Xizhi Road, the Qian Jiufu family at No. 53 Meilanfang, Beile Road, the Yang Xuelai family at No. 91 Fengyuli, Sapo Sai Road, the Li Gongpu family at No. 200 of the same lane, the Lin Yixian family at No. 93 of the same lane, the Fu Yunsheng family at No. 13 Jia'an, Pingjili Road, and the Yu Jiayong family at No. 33 Renjili, Ximen Road, and more than 20 other households. They could not remember the rest. The stolen goods were immediately retrieved and taken to the Second Special Court yesterday. The police lawyer Chen Ming first presented the case, followed by the victims who complained about the previous events. Hu confessed to the theft without denial. The judge ordered him remanded in custody and postponed the sentencing.</p>
<p>If She has a Marital Relationship with Shao Changming, She Replies that She Only Cohabited with Him for a Long Time, and Now They Have Separated. When Wang Xiuzhen Was Questioned, She Claimed that She Did Not Know Shao Xueying and Could Not Be Considered Shao Changming's Daughter-in-Law. The police station, finding conflicting statements from both parties, decided to transfer the four men and women, along with Liu and Dong who reported them, to the District Court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The City Chamber of Commerce Pleads for the Flower and Tree Industry <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Requests Exemption from Requisitioning Zhao Jia Garden Village Land</p>
<p>Orders the Ministry of Railways to Find a Way to Bypass It</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang yesterday, requesting the National Government to instruct the Ministry of Railways to exempt Zhao Jia Garden Village land from requisition. The original text reads, "To the honorable Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang: According to a complaint from the Flower and Tree Industry Guild, after the Ministry of Railways requisitioned civilian land to build the Joint Transportation Terminal and changed its plans, it gave up 1,400 mu of land originally designated west of Zhongshan Road and south of Jiaotong Road, and suddenly added the purchase of 700 mu of land east to Zhao Jia Garden, etc., completely requisitioning the village households with thriving populations, flowers, and trees. The flower and tree industry in Shanghai is necessary for society and contributes to the prosperity of the city, and Zhao Jia Garden Branch Lane and other villages are the production area for five-fourths of the flowers and trees. The fields are connected, exceeding a thousand mu, with a staggered view and spring in all seasons. Since cultivation began nearly two hundred years ago, there are millions of large and small flowers and trees. Among them, rare and exotic species have been planted for four or five years, or cultivated for forty or fifty years, before they can yield a small profit. Fathers pass on the business to sons, and grandsons and great-grandsons follow. The entire village has more than 500 households and thousands of people, who depend on it for food and clothing. Even the flowers, fruits, and plants that Shanghai people appreciate rely heavily on Zhao Jia Garden products. However, the Ministry of Railways plans to requisition the historical and valuable gardens of Zhao Jia Garden to build a joint transportation terminal, causing all the villagers to lose their skills and jobs. If they relocate elsewhere, it is important to know that deeply rooted trees are not suitable for the soil and are difficult to plant, unlike rice, sorghum, and wheat, which can be sown anywhere. After the requisition, the land prices in the vicinity will increase, which is beyond the reach of the people. If compensation is given, it is important to know that the cultivation of garden trees is not the work of a day or night. Those who cultivate this have lost their basic livelihood, so how will an eight-member family survive in the next ten years? Since the Qilu War, there have been frequent soldiers, and the survivors of the disaster are scarred. If they are forced to relocate again, they will become refugees. Therefore, we respectfully request you to work together to help and ensure that the Ministry of Railways retracts its order, finds a way to avoid it, alleviates the people's suffering, and maintains their livelihoods." It is important to know that flowers and trees are not easy to transplant and are different from other agricultural products. Even if relocation fees are given, the garden owners abandon their ancestral businesses and still find it difficult to make a living. Although the Ministry of Railways' plan to purchase land for the joint transportation station involves civilian property, the original designation was west of Zhongshan Road and south of Jiaotong Road, where there are no villages and the damage to the people is shallow. When the state undertakes public utilities, it should also consider the livelihoods of the people nearby. But if a way can be found to avoid it, it is always best to choose the lesser of two evils. Now, abandoning the original plan with fewer obstacles, it is replacing it with a densely populated village with centuries of tree planting, leaving them with nowhere to move and no land to transplant. Thousands of residents are on the verge of desperation. In terms of policy, this is also a great violation of public sentiment and shocking. We hereby telegraph to ask for your judgment and respectfully request that you forward it to the government, allowing them to instruct the Ministry of Railways to exempt the entire Zhao Jia Garden village from inclusion in order to maintain the villagers' livelihoods. The people are panicked and await your instructions. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this."</p>

<p>Participating in the Chicago World's Fair</p>
<p>Entrusted by the China Travel Service</p>
<p>The Chinese Photographic Society (abbreviated as Huashe) is the largest organization in the domestic photography community. Its members each have their own expertise, and have made great contributions in photographic academic inventions, art, manufacturing, writing, etc. Now, as our country participates in the Chicago World's Fair, the photography exhibits have been specially entrusted to the China Travel Service by the World's Fair Preparatory Committee for collection and display in the United States to promote national glory. The nature of the exhibits is divided into scenic spots, new and old buildings, and social customs. Art photography works are also being collected. It is learned that the travel agency is working hard on collecting exhibits. In order to achieve perfection, they feel that the collection method for art photography is quite different from other exhibits, so they have requested the Huashe to be responsible for the collection of art photography. It is reported that the society has agreed to take on the responsibility. Recently, the chairman of the society, Mr. Hu Boxiang, has met with directors Lang Jingshan, Zhang Zhenhou, Shao Woyun, Guo Xiqi, Qian Jinghua, Ding Song, Zhu Shuren, etc., to actively plan the collection rules and implementation methods, and will soon invite photographic organizations and experts from all over the country to participate and discuss everything, and work together to achieve great prestige.</p>
<p>About the Kim Cheol Kidnapping Case</p>
<h3 id="e150">Huang Zhanying's Confession <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency says that since the Korean resident Kim Cheol was kidnapped, the collusion between Huang Zhanying and the Japanese has made people indignant. Kim's friend Ji Qing even had a major negotiation with Wu Chengyu because of this. On the ninth of this month, Huang sent a letter to Ji, stating his grievances. Ji also published a reply letter, asking Huang to confess. Huang then sent a very detailed confession to Kim Cheol. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e151">Ji and Huang's Negotiations <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>At 5 PM on the 12th of this month, Wu Chengyu and Ji Qing met at the Guanshengyuan restaurant by appointment to discuss ways to resolve this matter. Wu insisted that the matter should still be resolved by the members of the alliance. Ji said that the case should be reviewed by the Kuomintang branch, the government, and the Shanghai national salvation groups. If there is doubt, they will be sent to court for punishment. Or Huang can send a statement to Kim Cheol, and if Kim deems it to be true, he will publish it in the newspaper to restore Huang's reputation. On the afternoon of the 13th, Huang indeed sent a letter of defense, but Ji pointed out that Huang's address was never disclosed. If he was being assessed, why would his whereabouts be so secretive? On the 14th, Wu Chengyu gathered fellow Cantonese again at his office to discuss. He still did not advocate for public disclosure. Ji Qing said that within this week, if Wu Chengyu and Huang Zhanying did not hand over the documents they took away and come forward publicly, in addition to asking the authorities to arrest them, he would still publish the entire situation in a long article. On the morning of the 15th, Huang Zhanying again asked someone to invite Ji to meet at the Kunlun room of the East Asia Restaurant at 5 PM. Huang said that he had been seriously ill since the incident and had not seen the newspaper, which led to misunderstandings. He asked for ways to explain and restore his reputation. Ji said that there were two ways to handle this case: 1. Explain to Kim Cheol and his son, and after Kim approves, publish it in the newspaper. 2. Conduct a public review by the Party Headquarters and various national salvation organizations, and if there is no suspicion, publish it in the newspaper. However, everything must be public from now on, and after the incident, I have reported it to important agencies. If necessary, public disclosure is even more convincing to the people. Ji then asked about the source of a certain amount of money and a certain item, and Huang answered them all. Now, because the whereabouts of Kim and his son are unknown, it has been temporarily put on hold. However, the letters from all parties regarding this matter are sufficient to prove its true nature.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Huang's Letter to Kim <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Dear Brother Cheol,</p>
<p>After this incident, I was relieved to learn that you were safe. But you mistakenly believe that I am a traitor, which is extremely unfair and infuriating. Do you want me to be arrested by the Japanese to feel satisfied? The fact that I am not a traitor has already been explained to Brother Ji, but it is still seen in the newspaper. In this way, you are disloyal to a friend, and I have been planning to unite with you day and night for a long time. So, I am unwise to associate with you. Now, for the sake of clarity between us, and according to Brother Ji's words, I would like to clarify the following:</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Eight questions, two pieces of advice, separately explained. Eight points of clarification: (1) On the day of the incident, I left less than two minutes before it happened, but you strongly said that I left more than forty minutes later. I don't know what your intention is. Moreover, the place is far from the police station. No one blew a whistle when the incident occurred. I risked my life to escape and immediately reported it to the police. The facts can be known by investigation. And I did not come with the police at the time because I was afraid of being abducted or shot by the violent Japanese (I had no gun in my hand at the time, how could I resist?) Then, I would not be able to save myself, let alone save others. (2) It was reported that the evidence had been sent to the Japanese Consulate. I don't know what you saw or heard. If I were a traitor, I would have offered all kinds of documents and covenants to the violent Japanese in order to receive rewards. Why have I been preserving them until now? Because when I moved houses on November 21, the documents entrusted by Brothers Ji and Xu were handed over to my fiancée to be kept in secret, because the star-based agency you invited me to was involved. Otherwise, if this incident had happened and it was searched by the violent Japanese, I would have no freedom even if I made a hundred excuses. (3) If you say that I am acting as a traitor, think about how many times I have been in contact with you in the past few months. In this month alone, I went to Danfenglou about four times, and I also met at Guanshengyuan three or four times (this refers to the times I talked with you, Brother Cheol, there was almost no day when I was alone). These places are all in Chinese territory, and the violent Japanese can easily arrest me. Don't you see that the violent Japanese mistakenly thought that the place was in Chinese territory and arrested me because they had not notified the French police station? It shows that arrests in the Chinese Concession are easier than in the French Concession. In the psychology of the Japanese, if I were colluding with them, how could I not arrange meetings at Danfenglou and Guanshengyuan to act? Moreover, each meeting was arranged the day before, and it was not impossible to do it leisurely. No one is so foolish as to do this at night. (4) As the saying goes, "To kill a snake, first cut off its head; to catch a thief, first catch the king." If I were a traitor, I have been associating with the leaders of your country's revolution, Mr. Qu, since the beginning, and my goal has been to discuss the anti-Japanese actions of the two peoples. The contact has been close. Just to take the recent month as an example, I have been to Hangzhou twice, sightseeing and visiting everywhere. Recently, Zhao came to Songjiang from Hangzhou and asked me to visit. All of this can be inquired of Mr. Zhao and cannot be denied. If I were betraying the alliance and acting as a traitor, I would not seek heavy rewards, but would act to capture the king. From this, it can be seen that the suspicion that I am a traitor is a big mistake. (5) All traitors must first obtain huge amounts of money. In the past few months, I have been running around with you day and night. What is my situation? I think you all know it. I have no clothes for different seasons. I wear summer clothes in spring and winter clothes in summer. The pawn tickets are full of my pockets, which you have seen and can verify. (6) I originally lived on Avenue Joffre. The idea of moving houses came from you. Moreover, the house in Ruyi Lane was personally found and rented by you, and it was your former residence. How could it be difficult for the Japanese to observe this early? There is another reason why it was discovered by the Japanese. After the house was rented in the star, you knew that I had not paid the rent on Avenue Joffre. You can check the two landlords. I cannot move in. At that time, you often came to Ruyi Lane. The key was in your hand. I don't know if you brought anyone there. It is difficult to guarantee that this negligence was detected by the enemy. How can you accuse me on suspicion? (7) Cars are the easiest way to abduct people in Shanghai. Traitors must first conceal their behavior. If I were acting as a spy, I would never bring people into my own house, causing suspicion. Nor would I run away by myself, and not go with the Japanese to point out and arrest people, pretending that I was also arrested in order to conceal myself. Now, because I escaped, I am accused of being a traitor. Then, in the future, revolutionaries must first decide to be arrested by the enemy together to prove that they are not traitors. I am afraid that no comrade will agree with this method. Moreover, if my contact with you was colluding with the enemy, it would be easy to drive around at night or have the Japanese arrest you on the road and put you in the car. Why don't you think about this? How shallow is your view? (8) I also saw in the newspaper that it said that I had moved the house two weeks ago, but nothing was left when I escaped. Upon investigation, it has not been ten days since I moved to Ruyi Lane. How could there be a matter of moving out two weeks ago? This fact is not true. Arbitrarily slandering people can be seen from this. Ten minutes before the incident, you entered my room twice, and all the items were there. If they were moved away, you could have asked. Why use this as a pretext after the incident? Moreover, I have no extra belongings. I only have two suitcases and quilts, etc. for daily use. I have nothing else, as all my comrades know. When I owed rent at Da Jiangnan, Brother Ji guaranteed me. At this time of accusation, this simple luggage was either stolen by robbers or kept by the landlord. In short, when the incident occurred, you entered the room twice. Ask your conscience, did I move anything? This doubt can be broken. My clarification shows that I absolutely did not act as a traitor. Moreover, although my association with you is shallow, I have been running around for the revolution for twenty years. What wealth or power has never changed my integrity, which is well known to all my friends. Now, because of your words, my entire life's reputation and career are ruined. If I go to the underworld, my grievances will be forever buried in the sea. Now I have to raise the following questions: (1) It is said that I claim to be the leader and have printed business cards and documents, and that I have a Western-style house with a monthly rent of 200 taels of silver and a car of my own. Where is the Western-style house, what is the license plate of the car, and where are the printed documents? Unless you immediately go and forge them, this is the first question to answer. (2) The newspaper said that your intention to rent the house in Ruyi Lane and the house in Ximen that you discussed renting before was a consistent policy. You are slandering people. This time the house was rented at your suggestion. How can there be a consistent matter? Is this a way of forcibly incriminating people? This is the second question to be asked. (3) This time it was completely my personal action with you, and it had nothing to do with the alliance. Why do you insist that you believe in Mr. Wu and bring him in out of thin air, causing trouble? Is this adding fuel to the fire and making Mr. Wu angry and arresting me? This is the third question to be asked. As for what can be said to be advice, (1) If you slander me so much, the Chinese and Korean peoples will feel even more difficult. Who will help your country in the future? (2) I am afraid that this kind of behavior of yours is slandering comrades and destroying your personality. You are not worth cherishing, but what about your violation of the alliance? Therefore, if you do not realize your mistakes after Brother Ji's method, what is called "all the past is like yesterday's death, all the future is like today's birth"? Quickly publish a correction so that the people of society can understand right and wrong. I will come out to meet you. Otherwise, for the sake of self-defense, I will have to tell everything to the court, and each will be responsible for his own reputation. I hope you will think twice. Please have your reply sent through Mr. Ji. I wish you all the best, Brother Cheol.</p>
<p>Yours,</p>
<p>Zhan Ying</p>

<p>Mr. Bao Zizheng writes: I am a person behind the times. I ended up inheriting my family business due to the decline of the rural economy. [Note: symbol for witch doctor] However, my spirit has suffered a great blow. My heart feels as if a sharp blade has pierced it. I have turned the wheels of time and entered the winter of the seventeenth year (presumably of the Republic). Suddenly, I received news from the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government about abolishing seven methods of divination, astrology, witch doctors, and geomancy. In my confusion, I had many thoughts. The third provision of the abolition methods stated, "...If, upon the expiration of the deadline, there is still no legitimate occupation, they should be admitted to local factories to learn another trade. In places where no factories have been established, they may be ordered to undertake appropriate work..." (The above was an order from the county government to the public security bureau). Unfortunately, there are no factories locally. Even if I wanted to change professions, I would have no opportunity. The public security bureau does not provide appropriate work, but instead forces us to continue our business as usual. When the wife of the officer has minor illnesses, they ask us to pray for her, but this is only fulfilling our obligations. Beyond this, they are extremely demanding, extorting much illegal money from us every month. We have lived under this coercion for four years, repeatedly trying to find a solution, but without opportunity. Now, fortunately, I have seen your newspaper's reader's advisor and am happy to write out two questions: 1) How to deal with the public security bureau to escape this pain of entanglement? 2) There are about ninety households in our area engaged in this profession, with a total of over five hundred people relying on it for their livelihood. For the sake of the whole group, if we are freed from this, what good methods are there to make a living and embark on a new path? Sir, kind sir, the above two questions concern the life and death of our five hundred people. Please publish them in your newspaper for everyone to discuss.</p>
<p>▲ The reporter notes that the practical problems raised by Mr. Bao not only fully expose the dark side of politics, but also fully expose the dark side of this society, and the questions are extremely valuable for public discussion. Therefore, it is specifically submitted to everyone for public discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Sijing writes: Here I have a question that I cannot understand, and I would like to ask you to provide me with a more practical and responsible answer. At the same time, there must be many people in society who are suffering as I am. Therefore, I hope you can publish my letter for everyone to discuss together. I am a graduate of the old system high school. Given the current social and economic situation, I am very satisfied that I was able to graduate from the old system high school. Looking back, how many people cannot enter middle school, and how many more cannot enter elementary school. I am truly content. After graduating, I began to enter society to find work. Naturally, I was full of enthusiasm to serve society. I don't cheat, I don't slack off. I want to do what I can and do what I should do. I refuse to compromise with darkness and corruption. I want to preserve my honesty and sincerity. I am confident that my intentions are not wrong, and my future is bright. But, strangely, the maxims and instructions of many wise men, philosophers, and scholars from the East and West have deceived me. I have examined my own behavior, and it is generally consistent with these maxims and instructions. However, I have encountered obstacles. After serving society for three years, I have ultimately failed and become unemployed. My family is very poor. My parents spent a lot of effort to enable me to graduate from middle school. Naturally, I must find a job to survive, but finding a job is not easy. Although I don't have very profound knowledge, I still have considerable skills for making a living. I have the right to demand that society provide me with work. I cannot simply wait to die. Sir, why can't I find a job? I have passed in front of singing halls, dance halls, taverns, and restaurants. They are all elated, never lacking food or drink, followed by wine and meat, and accompanied by prostitutes. Why can't I even get food? I am considered not to have starved to death yet. Sir, look around you, how many people have already starved and become withered wood? Sir, what is the reason for this? Is it fate? I don't believe it. Is it personal destiny? Where is the evidence? Sir, my question here is: First, why can a small number of people have food to eat without relying on their knowledge and ability, while the majority of honest and sincere people with considerable skills for making a living have no food to eat? Sir, I ask you to answer for me.</p>
<p>The reporter notes that I read Mr. Wu's letter in one breath, and a large stone was pressed on my heart again. I can't say anything. Naturally, this is also a question worth discussing, and now it is submitted to everyone for discussion. Mr. Bao writes: My friend, Mr. ×, only studied for one semester in junior high school before being forced by his father to enter business for two years. This spring, due to his father's business failure, he felt quite negative about the business world. Mr. × took the opportunity to ask his father to go to Hangzhou to study at a certain middle school, and his grades were very good. His father was also happy. However, his father recently wanted to revive his business and sent a letter urging him to return to help. Mr. × is by nature purely filial. If he does not return, he fears hurting his father's heart. If he returns, he feels that his knowledge is insufficient and is unwilling to leave school. The conflict of thoughts has led him into a state of distress. Mr. × wrote to me the other day, worrying about this. I am of shallow knowledge and not enough to solve his doubts. I specifically ask you for advice, hoping for detailed guidance so that Mr. × can find his place. Regarding Mr. ×'s family, his father has been in business for many years and accumulated over one hundred thousand yuan. After the failure, he can still be considered well-off. He has three older brothers. The eldest brother is also in business, and the second and third brothers are addicted to bad habits and have no occupation. Because of his two brothers, his father needs him to return to help, but he is also reluctant to force Mr. × not to return.</p>
<p>Reply: Your friend has a "pure and filial nature" and a desire to study, which is very admirable. Your friend's father, because his sons are not virtuous, insists on having your friend drop out of school to help him with his business. His plan is not correct, but his good intentions are understandable. The solution to this problem, in the reporter's view, could be for your friend to earnestly ask a respected and close relative in the clan to explain to your friend's father, making him understand the importance of studying (such as the fact that the second and third sons do not engage in proper occupations is precisely because they did not study, which can also be presented as proof), and to change his stubborn view. Considering the affection between your friend and his father, and your friend's determination to study is so firm, his father will surely be unwilling to unduly violate his wishes.</p>

<p>Harmful to Youth, Truly Undermining</p>
<p>Water Police Detective Deng Jiagen reported to the French police the night before last that the water police had received a report that someone was specializing in selling spring palace erotic photos at the pier. He immediately arrested one person, who confessed that the organization was located at No. 44 Mill Street under his jurisdiction. Please investigate and arrest them. The head of the police approved the request and sent a detective to go to the place together, arresting Suzhou native Xie Miaosheng and Shanxi native Tang Jinshu, and seizing two rattan boxes of such photos, numbering hundreds. They were taken to the police station. Police lawyer Chen Ming presented the case, stating that the police were prosecuting according to Article 251 of the Criminal Law, and submitted the photos for the record. Xie and Tang both confessed that the photos were actually sent by a Lin surname from outside, and were resold by civilians to Laochang on Simalu (i.e., addicts) for one yuan each, earning a small profit of two jiao. Judge Zhang verified the confession and sentenced Xie Miaosheng and Tang Baoshu in court for the crime of jointly selling obscene pictures, each fined one hundred yuan. If they are unable to pay, two yuan will be used to offset one day of imprisonment. The seized photos were confiscated.</p>

<p>Human Hearts Are Truly Unfathomable</p>
<p>The Path of Friendship is Fraught with Difficulty</p>
<p>Wang Fukang, 19 years old, and Chen Rongchang, 22 years old, both natives of Ningbo, were formerly apprentices at the Dachangxiang Foreign Goods and Cloth Company in Ningbo. Recently, the company's business was slow, so they were both laid off. A few days ago, Chen Rongchang planned to come to Shanghai to seek work. Knowing that Wang was still unemployed at home, he went to invite him to come to Shanghai together. Wang immediately agreed. After arriving in Shanghai, the two stayed at the Rongji Inn near the Sino-French School on Avenue Metténie in the French Concession. Yesterday morning, around 3:00 AM, Wang awoke from a dream and suddenly realized Chen was not there. He thought he had gone out for urgent needs. However, after waiting until dawn, he still did not see him. He began to suspect something was wrong. He quickly put on his clothes and opened Chen’s suitcase. The money and clothes inside were all gone. Wang was desperate and helpless. He immediately went everywhere to investigate Chen's whereabouts, but to no avail. In a state of dilemma, he suddenly had thoughts of ending his life. Around 4:00 PM, he went to the Dasaban Wharf in Tilanqiao and jumped into the Huangpu River to commit suicide. Fortunately, a Japanese man working at a nearby wharf saw him and quickly devised a way to pull him out of the water. He then reported the incident to the police station, who dispatched an ambulance to send Wang to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, he had been in the water for too long, and his life was still in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Broadcasting News of the Datong Bookstore Family Education Lecture Series <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>The Datong Bookstore Family Education Lecture Series was temporarily suspended for two days due to the expansion of the Sino-Western Pharmacy Radio Station. Yesterday, the radio station's construction was completed, and Ms. Shu Zhirui, an education expert who studied in France, was once again invited to give a lecture. The topic was "A Comparison of Chinese and French Families." Her speech briefly stated that the advantages of French families are that their organization is simple and effective. Both the husband and wife can fulfill their respective duties. That is, the husband can diligently take on the economic responsibilities of the family, and the wife is respectful to her husband and capable of managing the household, so that the man has no worries at home, and after a day of hard work, he can feel comfortable and comforted when he returns home. Our country's old, large families cannot be compared with this, and even modern so-called "modern small families" are very different. Because Chinese so-called modern housewives have the extravagant habits of French women but lack their hard-working nature, which often disappoints their husbands. Her words were quite pertinent and worthy of emulation for Chinese family organization. Unfortunately, the speech was lengthy and cannot be fully recorded. It is said that today, Mr. Lu Jizeng, the Dean of Studies at Datia University, will speak on "The Value of Family Education."</p>

Xiang is good at engraving seals, closely imitating the Qin and Han dynasties. The art world praises him as a genius who is also skilled in calligraphy and painting, especially in flower painting. I once saw his small painting of wisteria and spider webs, which was as meticulous as Yao Sheng's. Yet, modern painters highly respect him. The famous painter Huang Huating praised him as a rare talent. Recently, he and Daqian have collaborated on dozens of fine works, which will be exhibited on the third floor of the New World for three days starting from the 17th of the national calendar.

<h3 id="e172">Readers' Advice <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Bao Zhizheng inquires: I am a person behind the times. Due to the decline of the rural economy, I had no choice but to inherit my family's business as a shaman and doctor. However, my spirit has been greatly affected. My heart feels as if a sharp blade has been thrust into it. I got off the wheel of time and turned back to the winter of the 17th year [of the Republic], and suddenly received the news from the Civil Affairs Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government that it was abolishing the seven methods of divination, astrology, shamanism, physiognomy, and geomancy. In my chaos, I have had many feelings. Article 3 of the abolition methods states that "... those who do not have proper jobs after the deadline should be taken into factories established by the local government to learn a new profession. Localities that do not have factories may order them to take on corresponding work..." (The above is an order from the county government to the Public Security Bureau). Unfortunately, there is no factory in my area. Even if I want to change professions, I have no opportunity, and the Public Security Bureau does not give me corresponding work. Instead, it orders me to continue operating as usual. When his wife has a minor illness, they also ask us to pray for her. But this is fulfilling an obligation. Apart from this, he extorts us in every possible way, seizing many illegal fees from us every month. We have lived under this kind of coercion for four years, repeatedly trying to find a way to deal with it, but without opportunity. Now, fortunately, I saw your newspaper's Reader's Advice column, and I am happy to write out two questions: 1. How to deal with the Public Security Bureau to get rid of this painful constraint? 2. There are about 90 such practitioners in our area, and the total number of people living on this is more than 500. For the sake of everyone, if we are freed, what good ways are there to make a living and step into a new path? Kind sir, these two questions are related to the life and death of our 500 people. Please publish them in your newspaper for everyone to discuss.</p>
<p>▲ The reporter notes that the practical problems raised by Mr. Bao not only fully expose the dark side of politics, but also fully expose the dark side of this society. Moreover, the questions are of great value for public discussion. Now, they are specifically submitted for public discussion.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Sijing writes: Here, I have a question that I cannot understand no matter how much I think about it, and I would like to ask you, sir, to give me a relatively practical and responsible answer. At the same time, there must be many people in society who have experienced the same pain as I have. Therefore, I hope that you, sir, can publish my letter and let everyone discuss it together. I am a graduate of the old high school system. Considering the current social and economic situation, I am already very satisfied that I was able to graduate from the old high school system. Looking back, how many people cannot enter middle school, and even more people cannot enter elementary school. I am really already content. After graduation, I started to enter society and look for a job. Naturally, I am serving society with 120,000 points of enthusiasm. I do not cheat, I do not slack, and I will do what I should do to the best of my ability. I am not willing to compromise with darkness and corruption. I want to preserve my honesty and sincerity. I am confident that my intentions are not wrong and that my future is bright. But, strangely, the maxims and famous teachings of many sages and scholars, both Chinese and Western, have deceived me. I have examined my own behavior and found that it generally does not violate these maxims and famous teachings. However, I have run into obstacles. After serving society for three years, I have finally failed and become unemployed. My family is very poor. My parents also spent a lot of effort for me to graduate from middle school. Naturally, I must find a job to survive, but how easy is it to find a job? Although I do not have any profound knowledge, I still have considerable skills to make a living. I have the right to demand that society give me work. I cannot wait to die of starvation. Sir, why can't I find a job? When I pass by singing halls, dance halls, restaurants, and taverns, everyone is excited and happy. Those who are not full eat and drink, followed by wine and meat, and then singing girls serving wine. But why can't I even get a meal? I am still not starved to death. Sir, look around you, how many people are already so hungry that they have become a withered tree? Sir, what is the reason for this? Heaven? I do not believe it. Individual destiny? Where is the evidence? Sir, my question here is: 1. Why can a small number of people have food to eat without relying on their knowledge and ability, while the majority of honest, sincere people with considerable skills to make a living do not have food to eat? Sir, I am Lei Jia, please help me answer this.</p>
<p>The reporter notes: I read Mr. Wu's letter in one breath, and another big stone was suddenly pressed on my heart, and I could not say anything. Naturally, this is also a question worth discussing. Now, it is submitted for everyone to discuss. Bao Jun inquires: My friend Mr. × only studied in junior high school for one semester before his father forced him to enter business for two years. This spring, due to his father's business failure, he felt quite negative about the business world. Mr. × took the opportunity to ask his father to go to Hangzhou to study at a certain middle school. His grades were very good, and his father was also happy. However, his father recently wanted to revive his business and sent a letter asking him to return to help. Mr. × is pure and filial by nature. If he does not return, he fears hurting his father's heart, but if he returns, he feels that his knowledge is insufficient and is unwilling to leave school. The conflict in his thoughts has made him fall into a state of depression. Mr. × wrote to me a few days ago, worried about this. I am ignorant and cannot enlighten him, so I especially ask you, sir, for guidance so that Mr. × can find what is right for him. Regarding Mr. ×'s family, his father had accumulated more than 100,000 yuan from business for many years. After the failure, he is still considered to be well-off. He has three elder brothers. The eldest brother is also in business, and the second and third brothers are addicted to bad habits and have no jobs. Because his two brothers are like this, it is one reason why his father must ask him to return to help, and it is also a reason why Mr. × is reluctant to return.</p>
<p>Reply: Your friend is "pure and filial" and has the ambition to learn, which is very admirable. Your friend's father wants to order your friend to abandon his studies and help him in business because his sons are not good. Although his plan is not very correct, his good intentions are excusable. In the reporter's opinion, the solution to this problem is whether your friend can ask a more prestigious and amiable person from your relative clan to explain to your friend's father and make him understand the importance of learning (such as the reason why the second and third sons do not engage in proper work is because they did not study, which can also be brought up as proof), and to turn back his stubborn opinion. I think with your friend's feelings for his father and your friend's ambition to study being so firm, his father will definitely not bear to disobey his wish.</p>

<p>On the day before the Premier's Memorial Week, Jinling University specially invited Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry and Commerce, to come to the school to give a speech. The topic was "Dynamic Materialism"</p>
<p>Chen said that after the Revolution of 1911, the Chinese people initially believed that ideals could save the country, but then tended towards fatalism. Recently, they have returned to fantasy. After the September 18th Incident, the Chinese people have all fallen into a state of hesitation. To seek a way out for thought, one must first not doubt oneself, but develop outward from oneself as a starting point. Chen admitted that his personal thought belongs to the materialistic aspect, so he opposes causality and fatalism, and proves that religion, ethics, conscience, psychology, and artistic principles often change due to material changes. All human thoughts originate from matter, and matter is constantly changing, so one should promote personal life with a dynamic materialistic view, and should not take the path of empty morality, which makes everyone fall into an atmosphere of double personality. At the same time, one can seek the completion of the actual responsibilities between people and make the common living standard of the masses.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 16th Telegram At the Third Plenary Session, Cheng Tianfang proposed a proposal to determine educational goals and reform the educational system, which is divided into three items: A. National Education, seven items for B. Production Education, five items for C. Teacher Education, and seven items for D. Talent Education.</p>
<p>The Central Organization Committee proposes the following measures for reforming higher education: 1. Universities should be established by the Ministry of Education. Universities established by provincial and municipal governments, organizations, and private individuals should be closed down, except for colleges of agriculture, industry, medicine, and science that have special achievements. 2. National universities should be temporarily established in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuchang, and Xi'an. The Ministry of Education should consider merging or closing the original national universities and independent colleges based on the situation. 3. National universities should be divided into colleges of arts, sciences, law, agriculture, industry, commerce, medicine, and pharmacy. All education colleges should be merged into the college of arts and changed to the department of education. 4. National universities should have at least three colleges. National Peiping Normal University should be closed immediately. 5. Provincial and municipal governments may establish independent colleges based on local conditions. 6. Provincial and municipal governments and private colleges should be limited to establishing colleges of agriculture, industry, commerce, medicine, and science. 7.

Those that have been established should be merged into national universities or ordered to close down. 8. In all public universities and independent colleges, the courses in literature, philosophy, and social sciences should have domestic teaching materials and set up special subjects or be incorporated into related subjects as much as possible for teaching. 9. The Ministry of Education should hold graduation exams once or twice a year for all public and private universities and independent colleges. 10. The Ministry of Education should detail the principles and methods of moral education for universities and independent colleges. 11.

<h3 id="e181">For the Sake of Middle Schools Nationwide (II) <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Maoru</p>
<p>Based on experience, educational theory, and modern trends, the teaching hours in middle schools should never be increased. So, what is the basis for the Ministry of Education's resolute increase?</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that after the time for each subject is increased, the students' level will definitely improve. However, the opposite is true in practice. For schools that do not study seriously, it is useless to require 35 hours of class per week, let alone 48 hours, because teachers can arbitrarily skip classes and students can skip classes for no reason. Even in class, they are aware of the classroom hearing picture described by Mr. Zhuang Yixuan. There is no specified work on a daily basis, and there is no strict method of checking. Teachers and students are all making a living in the word "muddle along". In schools that study seriously, each subject has work for students to do every day, there are temporary tests every week, monthly exams every month, and a general review/term exam once a semester. Most teachers are patient and try their best to make sure that students benefit as much as possible. In this kind of school, taking more than 20 hours of classes per week is already very busy, because students also have sports and group education activities. After the class hours are increased, teachers have to reduce the assigned work, and students have to reduce the time for self-study. The result is a decline in level.</p>
<p>To summarize the above, the effects of increasing teaching time are: 1. Insufficient self-study time, 2. Lack of exercise time, 3. Hindering extracurricular activities, 4. Lowering the level of each subject.</p>
<h3 id="e182">2. Cancelling the Liberal Arts and Science Divisions is Too Unrealistic <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The first school system prescribed in our country was not implemented. The second school system promulgated stipulated that all middle school courses were fixed and did not divide into subjects. In the Xuantong period, middle schools began to divide into liberal arts and science. In the early years of the Republic of China, although there was a method to cancel the division of liberal arts and science, it was soon restored. During the period when schools were established in the Qing Dynasty, the number of middle school students was very small, and the level of mathematics and science was not very high. Most people who entered middle school hoped to go to college, so it was still possible to force them to not divide into subjects. However, in the Xuantong period, the method of dividing into liberal arts and science had already been hotly debated. At present, the number of middle school students increases year by year, so the aspirations and abilities are more varied. Moreover, the level of mathematics and science for college entrance exams has been greatly improved compared to before (Jiaotong University can be taken as an example). Now, regardless of the ability and aspirations of young people, they are all taught to use the same time to learn the same teaching materials. The dull ones sigh in vain, and the excellent ones are restricted. How can this work?</p>
<p>I guess the Ministry of Education thinks that middle school courses are all basic and that every student should learn them, and no student can't learn them, so fixing everything is not a problem. This view is too far from reality. Elementary school courses can be viewed in this way, but junior high school is not entirely the case, and high school is even harder to say. Students who are close to mathematics and science (especially arithmetic) have strong interest and talent. The books are deeper and they learn faster, and they do not think it is hard. Students who are close to literature get headaches when they see arithmetic. It is already very difficult to teach them to learn algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. It is only possible for them to wait for the next life if they are asked to learn advanced algebra, analytic geometry, and do practical exercises. Furthermore, in the case of female students, there are actually more difficulties. At present, almost two-thirds or more of the students in girls' middle schools are studying liberal arts. To suddenly change them to learn mathematics and science and meet the standards set by the Ministry is truly like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree.</p>
<p>Or the Ministry of Education believes that ordinary middle schools are exclusively for preparing students to go to university (whether this concept is reasonable will not be discussed for the time being), so people who enter middle school have to prepare for college entrance exams and have to prepare for the courses for college entrance exams. I don't know that in this era of world chaos and famine, who can decide what will happen in two or three years. If you survey the students in the first year of high school and ask them if they will go to college after graduation, at least 50% are undecided. Even if they have definite aspirations, they still have to change them temporarily. Those who go to college suddenly go to work, and those who go to work suddenly go to college. Human affairs are uncertain, and this is generally the case. Therefore, it is necessary to discuss that there is really no need for everyone to learn advanced mathematics. People who enter ordinary middle schools will not all go to university, and those who go to university will not all apply for science and engineering. Since the need is like this and the facts are like that, why does the Ministry of Education want to cancel the liberal arts and science subjects to make it difficult for young people who are not interested and do not have the aspirations? It is not only making it difficult for young people who are not interested and do not have the aspirations, but even young people who are interested in mathematics and science are subject to various restrictions and cannot fully develop their special abilities. This is such a pity.</p>

Since the Mukden Incident, the school has specially hired Ruan Lue, a military instructor from Jiaotong University, to come to the school to take charge of training. The results have been remarkable in the past year. The military inspection officer Chen Bingchang of the Chief Inspectorate of the Capital Training Department came to the school to inspect the day before yesterday (14th). He first went to the lecture hall to conduct oral exams for the students, who were able to answer one by one. In particular, Lu Shijun, a student in the first year of senior high school, had an excellent attitude. The reporter felt very respectful after the visit. Then he went to the playground to inspect the skills. All of them were directed by the students. The commands and movements were very serious. Chen commented that he was full of spirit and agile. He did not take pictures until 12 o'clock. After the lunch, Chen resigned. It is heard that Nanyang Model Middle School and Fudan Middle School have been selected to hold a joint military exercise on the afternoon of the 21st of this month for the final inspection.</p>

<p>Tomorrow Afternoon China vs. Russia for the International Game</p>
<p>The Donghua Jinan Football Teams will meet again at the Chinese Baseball Field at 3:00 p.m. today for the West League A Group Game. According to the past results of the game, Donghua has won six games and has a high voice for the championship. Jinan has won six games in seven games and still has hope for the championship. The talent and strength of the two teams are also at the same level, and it is difficult to distinguish between them. However, today, Jinan striker Luo Haiguang was fined for one month and could not participate in the game, which had a great impact. Xu Yahui's ability to play can increase a lot of strength. Everyone in Donghua is strong, which is an advantage invisibly. However, things depend on people. Moreover, the survival of the championship in the future is at stake. The two teams will definitely fight for it. It is hoped that the athletes of both sides will meet with the attitude of gentlemen. Then, regardless of victory or defeat, it is worth watching. The referee is Bratov. Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m., the International Football Game will begin. There will be six countries participating on that day. China vs. Russia is on the baseball field, England vs. Portugal, Scotland vs. Jewish are all in the racecourse.</p>

At the beginning of the battle, both sides were like hungry tigers pouncing on food. They came and went and worked hard. After several rounds, Chen Baoqiu opened the scoring, and cheers rose suddenly. In an instant, the pirate Smith returned a goal, and Ren Jiexing took the lead by a free throw. However, Xia Guang took advantage of Ge Tang'an's foul, and Smith added two points. The pirates took the lead with 4-3. Xia Guang did not show weakness and tried hard to score.

<p>The Hong Kong Chinese Sports Association held an executive committee meeting at 7:00 p.m. on the 12th. Chairman Mo Ying chaired the meeting and decided to select a basketball team to come to Shanghai for the basketball city tournament. The date of the competition will be decided after contacting the Shanghai side.</p>
<p>Better than four, the audience cheered enthusiastically, thinking that the Daxia [students] would be able to work hard and make progress. However, the pirates came fiercely, like a storm, adding pressure horizontally. From then on, Xia Guang fell into decline. Although he struggled desperately, it was in vain.</p>
<p>▲Xia Guang was at a loss Since then, only the pirates have been seen appearing under the basket. Qi'er has every shot, and Smith White Knight has played wonderfully. The rear guard Piratezhou Liwen is strictly guarded and acts consistently, unstoppable, promoting superb skills, and establishing great achievements. On the other hand, Xia Guang's rear defense is lax, and there is no strategy to advance. It was not until 5-16 that Ren Jiexing scored a goal. The first half ended with the pirates winning 23-7.</p>
<p>▲The Pirates Have a Smooth Journey When the battle started again, the situation was as before, and Xia Guang still showed no improvement. Since 31-10, the pirate general Qi'er retired and was replaced by Da Shiguiya. Xia Guang struggled hard and made some progress. In these eight minutes, they made contributions to each other, and the situation was quite similar. In the last five minutes, Xiao Shiguiya replaced Zhou Liwen, and Qi'er continued to take the field while Smith rested. As a result of the fierce battle, the pirates scored 41 points and Xia Guang scored 20 points.</p>

<p>▲John Loses First and Wins Later At the beginning of the battle, Daredevil showed his strength, and Wo Tuo scored repeatedly. John was shocked and was at a disadvantage by 1-5 and 3-7. He tried his best to cheer up and work hard to advance. Chen Xianglong, Hou Xuemin, and Cheng Jingxing scored one after another and performed well. The defenders Wu Youliang and Tao Zunan were strictly guarded, and the ball was smooth. Daredevil, although still unwilling to show weakness, was ultimately unable to do what he wanted. In the first half, John scored 27 points and Daredevil scored 16 points.</p>
<p>▲Daredevil Comes Suddenly When the battle started again, Daredevil's momentum suddenly increased. Baumun Tuo scored three times in a row, and Touren also added two points, increasing the score by eight points. John's score was reduced, and at this time John's lineup was disorganized and in danger. This stalemate was tense. When Daredevil chased to 33-35, Touren scored a basket and got a free throw, increasing the score by one point. Suddenly, he exceeded John by 36-35.</p>
<p>▲John's Final Victory After a short stalemate, John's main general Chen Xianglong was fouled for the fourth time and left the field. It can be said that misfortune never comes singly. In addition, Daredevil's actions were rude, which worried John. But the blessed people have their own heavenly blessings. At this critical moment of John, the ball suddenly went smoothly, and Hou Xuemin and Cheng Jingxing made consecutive long shots, all of which were successful. The light of day was seen again, and Qingyun rose straight up and won the final victory with 45-37. Daredevil was fierce, but he had to surrender.</p>

<p>An Unprecedented Peak of 819.8 Taels Appeared</p>
<p>The Difference of 13 Taels Strong, the Ending Contains Latent Soft Signs</p>
<h3 id="e214">Swap Almost at Par <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still drastic changes, the storm was strong, and it was difficult to restrain. It happened to be the formal swap day, so the market started trading half an hour earlier, at 8:30 AM. However, the firms started even earlier, before 8:00 AM. The January-to-February swap was still being offered by short sellers, initially at 1.5 mace per tael, but trading was limited and immediately declined, with many parties swapping at less than 1 tael. Then it was only a few qian, and when the listing was announced, it was swapped at par. Hengxing and others traded quickly, and later many parties were willing to swap out, causing the short side to instead offer a premium of 1-2 qian, then immediately swapped at par. This was because the local spot market was quite plentiful, with about 4-5,000 taels, which affected the long side. An investigation found that the Dalian group had mixed long and short positions, but no large amounts. Yuanmao Yong, Tongtaichang, Yifeng, and Yongjun held short positions. As for the long side, there were Hengxing, Yifeng (about 6,000 bars in total), Tongfeng, Hengyingfeng, Hengqian, Changxiang, Chunyuan, Yong, etc. Many firms had not finished swapping, almost no one was entering or exiting January, and most were switching to February, with the listed prices shifting to February.</p>
<h3 id="e215">February's Complex Market Conditions <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, February's market was chaotic, and traders were at a loss, with fluctuations of 3-4 taels. However, the daily range was a strong 13 taels, and the result was a latent softening, falling more than 3 taels. Brokers still had no large transactions. The initial opening was stable, but the silver market and British silver fell continuously, American silver did not move, and exchange rates continued to rise. Fortunately, forward silver prices and American cotton both saw declines, so the gold price did not fall. Later, after a slight setback, the exchange rate rebounded slightly, reaching a peak of 819.8 taels, a record since the opening of the commercial market. However, as the exchange rate eased and there were rumors that large amounts might rebound, Hengxing and other long positions sold off, shocking the market and causing it to weaken suddenly, falling by more than 10 taels. The market's turbulence did not stop, and it went from firm to weak, eventually reaching 806.5 taels, still due to strong selling pressure. Finally, it eased slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Morning Market's Sharp Rise and Fall <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>From the morning at 8:30 AM, February opened at 812.2 taels, then fluctuated by 2 taels. Hengyu and Dadecheng sold, while Yongfeng and Hengchang Yongze bought. After 8:45 AM, Wanxingshunli and retail investors sold, and there was talk of swap long positions offering premiums, so it fell by more than 2 taels. At 9:00 AM, it was 808.2 taels. Then, Huabi absorbed January US dollars at 93.75 to 87.5, and January British silver absorbed 31.25. Yuanmao, Yongzhifeng, Yongfuxing, and Yongyuantai all bought, and March British silver was also absorbed by Huabi at 31.25. January US dollars were traded at 68.75, causing the gold price to jump 7 taels, reaching 15 taels around 9:30 AM. HSBC's listing announced that British silver was flat and American silver rose by 12.5, at 13.5 taels at the time. Afterwards, it gradually rose by more than 6 taels, but there was a 1-2 tael pullback, and the exchange market strengthened further. February US dollars were traded at 75, and March British silver was only settled at 25. On the trading floor, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Yonglai bought aggressively. By 10:00 AM, British silver had been reduced by 12.5, and US dollars by 37.5, causing the gold price to reach an unprecedented new price of 19.8 taels. Afterwards, although the exchange rate was further reduced, the domestic market was not tight, so the price fell back by 1-2 taels. Suddenly, it was heard that Hengyu was selling for Hengxing, and Hengchang, Yongfuyu, Qingfa, Yongfuchang, Futaiheng, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Yifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Wanxingshunli, and others were selling heavily. Hengxing also followed suit, until 11:00 AM, it broke the 10-tael mark, eventually reaching 808.1 taels. It was unexpected, and the changes were rapid. Afterwards, Zhifengyong and Yifengyong bought, pulling it up by 3 taels to 11 taels at 11:30 AM. Then, it was suppressed by 3 taels because March US dollars were available for sale at 28.0625 yuan, settled at 28 yuan, and Hongkang Yong, Yuanheng, Yuanmao, and Zhaofengchang sold off, immediately retreating to 8 taels. Hengxing and Hengyu bought slightly, and at 11:50 AM, it was 10.03 taels. Goods came out, and the noon closing was 9.7 taels.</p>
<p>(The After-Market Turned from Firm to Weak) The after-market opened at 11 taels, then from 11.8 taels to 10.5 taels. Qianchangxiang, Yuanxingyong, and retail investors bought, immediately reaching 12.8 taels, and January British silver was traded at 1.825. Later, Yuanchun, Yuantai, and Yuanmao Yong sold off, falling back by 3 taels, until 3:00 PM, it was 809.7 taels. Suddenly, Hengyu and Chunyuan Yong bought, Andar absorbed March US dollars at 28 yuan, and Holland absorbed 93.75, so it picked up by more than 4 taels in ten minutes, reaching 14 taels. In an instant, it fell back by more than 4 taels, and sellers were active. At 3:40 PM, it was 809.6 taels. Soon, it rose again to 12.2 taels, Chunyuan Yong and Hongxingyong bought, and HSBC absorbed March 93.75 as well. Since the sellers were active, at 4:00 PM, it was around 10 taels. Then it weakened further, and Fuxingyong, Zhifengyong, Yuhe, Hengyu, Hengxing, and others sold off in droves (and it was rumored that the goods were Hengxing's receipts), so the price frequently went downstream, until at 4:20 PM, it eventually reached 806.5 taels. Afterwards, Andar absorbed March 28 yuan again, Hengyu and others bought, and in three or four minutes, it rose by 3 taels to 809.5 taels. However, Hongkang Yong and general retail investors were eager to sell, and it was seen at 808.2 taels again. At that time, it rose again to 809 taels. By the time the market closed at 4:30 PM, it was 808.4 taels, approximately 3.5 taels lower than the previous day. Considering the flat swap, the daily range was a maximum of 19.8 taels and a minimum of 806.5 taels, a difference of 13.3 taels. The net decrease was 8.5 taels.</p>
<p>(Long Positions Suppressed by 12-13 Taels) The listed price of US dollars was raised by 12.5, resulting in 869 taels, a discount of 54 taels. It was then reduced by 37.5, resulting in 881 taels, a discount of 62-63 taels to 73 taels. In the afternoon, it was 70 taels or so, then 67 taels. The result was 73 taels, an increase of 12-13 taels compared to the previous day. The ledger showed 11 taels for this month, 10 taels for January and February, a supplementary payment of 8 taels, and 6 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(Heavy Trading by Various Firms) Trading on the trading floor was chaotic and erratic. Statistics showed that Yuanmao Yong, Wanxing, Yongfeng, Yuantai, Zhifengyong, Yuanchun, Fuxingyong, Hengchangyong, Bingxing, and Yuhe all bought. Hengyu initially bought and then sold (it was heard that it was selling for Hengxing). Fuyu bought and then sold. Shunli, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, Futaiheng, Fuchang, and Qianchangxiang all sold. In the afternoon, Qianchangxiang, Hengchangyong, Shunli, and Futaiheng all bought. Yuantai, Wanxing, Yuanmao Yong, Zhifengyong, Hongkangyong, and Yuanchun all sold off. The rest was mixed. The Dalian group had a total of 2,500-2,600 bars, roughly squared. The Guang group, Hengxing, traded a total of more than 100 bars on its own account and sold more than 500 bars. Yifeng had a small number of entries and exits.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Erratic Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>|Listing Market Changes|</p>
<p>Yesterday in the silver market, British silver continued to fall, while American silver remained unchanged. The same was true for private telegrams. The upward trend in exchange rates did not stop, increasing by 25 to 68.75. However, the local exchange market fluctuated from time to time. HSBC's initial listing showed British silver flat and American silver rising by 12.5. French and German also rose, and the rest remained unchanged. At 10:15, it suddenly reduced by half a grade, with British silver at 12.5 and American silver at 37.5. The others also followed suit, except for Hong Kong, which did not change. The domestic market initially showed British silver firm and then flat, and it remained stable in the afternoon, eventually shrinking by 0.0625 compared to the day before. American silver was loose in the morning and then strong, weakened at noon, and was firm and then flat in the afternoon, leveling out with the previous day. This was because the exchange rate continued to rise, and the gold market trended upward and then downward. Trading in various banks was quite lively, with more than 100,000 pounds of British silver being traded, with gold firms selling first and then buying. Various banks also traded against each other, and about 800,000-900,000 yuan of American silver was traded, with the pre-market buying and the post-market selling, with occasional hedging transactions. Banks such as Huabi bought strongly, and Andar absorbed in the afternoon, but there were also many who traded against each other. In summary, British silver was tight both openly and secretly, and American silver was initially raised in the listing and then reduced, with the domestic market leveling out.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Large Bars Down to 17 Pence <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 16th reported that large bars of silver frequently shrank, with closing prices for near and far futures both at 17 pence, a reduction of 0.0625 for near futures and 0.125 for far futures compared to the previous day. The exchange rate between British and American currency opened at 3 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e219">Silver Yuan Market Remains Lifeless <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver yuan market remained stable due to a lack of demand. Banks had no significant appetite for buying or selling yuan, and transactions between money shops were also limited. As a result, although the market was not entirely calm, it was vastly different from normal.</p>
<p>(Static and Dynamic Overnight Interest) The overnight interest rate for silver yuan in the morning market was 7 qian, 1 fen, 4 li, 3 hao, 7 hu, and half a si. The afternoon market was 7 qian, 1 fen, 4 li, and the result was the same as the previous day, showing the market's stability. The overnight interest rate for silver was 3 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day, with no change throughout.</p>
<p>(Rise in Auxiliary Jiangnan and Guangdong Fractional Currency) Jiangnan fractional yuan was 6 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, 8 hao, 7 hu, and half a si in the morning market, a decrease of 6 hao, 2 hu, and half a si compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market suddenly increased by 1.5 li and strengthened, reaching 6 qian, 2 fen, and 6.5 li. Transactions were 7,500 jiao in the morning market and 10,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong fractional yuan was 6 qian, 2 fen, and half a li in the morning market and 6 qian, 2 fen, and 0.875 li in the afternoon market. Transactions were 95,000 jiao in the morning market and 75,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins increased by 1,200 wen, reaching 394,700 wen.</p>
<p>(Inflow and Outflow of Silver Yuan Remain Flat) Yesterday, banks received more than 2 million in silver drafts from Chinese merchants, more than 1.2 million from foreign merchants, more than 2.4 million in special drafts, more than 900,000 in pledged transactions, and more than 5 million in various cargo tax drafts. 900,000 was withdrawn from the warehouse. Money shops and silver guilds received more than 28 million in drafts, and more than 3.9 million in scheduled drafts. Various exchange drafts received more than 600,000, and cash receipts were more than 800,000. For silver yuan, drafts were made out for 815,000 in the morning market and 570,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 55,000 in the morning market and 40,000 in the afternoon market. Over-the-counter banknotes were 40,000 in the morning market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. Checks were 30,000 in the morning market and 45,000 in the afternoon market. Bank transactions were 600,000 in the morning market and 400,000 in the afternoon market. Inflows and outflows of silver yuan accounts between banks were more than 1.5 million. Inflows and outflows of money shop banknotes were more than 1.1 million. Money shops and silver guilds received more than 8.3 million in drafts, and more than 1.7 million in scheduled silver yuan drafts.

Silver yuan pledge transactions were 700,000.</p>

<p>(Stock Market) A London dispatch on the 15th stated that the stock market gradually improved last week due to the somewhat clarified issue of war debts, and the Ministry of Finance's memorandum did not require additional special taxes to reorganize finances. In this new atmosphere, all trends were positive except for Gold Edge Bonds, which were somewhat restricted due to debt funds. German bonds also saw progress due to the recent resolution of the issue of joining the Geneva Disarmament Conference. Other foreign bonds showed slight progress, but then the trend became uncertain. Japanese bonds were calm, and Chinese bonds remained stable. In the industrial sector, although commerce was sluggish, values were stable. Oil stocks fluctuated due to the Anglo-Persian oil rights dispute, and mining stocks were strong. Rubber stocks were stagnant.</p>
<p>(Foreign Exchange) Gold pounds were steadily improving, and their rise was further accentuated by the fall in the franc due to the fall of the French cabinet. Chinese exchange rates were weak due to silver shrinkage, and Japanese exchange rates were uncertain.</p>
<p>(Large Bars) Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid reported that although there were not many sellers in the silver market last week, the price of silver fell due to the rebound in gold pounds and the closing of long positions. Transactions were small, with some selling from India, China, and the United States. China bought slightly at low prices, and the current price is very small.</p>

<p>|Other Securities Also Rose Well, by 4-5 Jiao to 6-7 Jiao|</p>
<p>|Financial Short-Term Securities Even Rose to 54 Yuan Before Trading Was Halted|</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange's spot market remained quiet, but the futures market was slightly more active than before. Transactions in securities such as Consolidated Salt Tax and Troop Reduction 20-Rolls were far better than before, and forward trading saw significant activity. It was estimated that the morning opening was more than 5.2 million, and the afternoon market was approximately 4.2 million, for a total of more than 9.4 million. Spot trading totaled 21,500 yuan. There was a possibility of an increase in bond redemptions, and general sentiment was particularly good. Investments from all parties were still relatively strong, and the demand for forward goods was also not quiet. Large transactions were no longer as hesitant as before. As a result, each price was in greater demand than supply and continued to rise. The result was an increase of one yuan for the entire set of six compared to the previous day, and other securities also rose by 5-6 jiao to 8-9 jiao, but the fluctuations were still peaceful. In addition, due to increased demand, the 20-year financial short-term securities even rose to 54 yuan in the after-market before trading was halted.</p>

<p>Marked Yarn Futures Jumped Wildly in the Second and Third Sessions</p>
<p>The yarn market was flat and weak in the morning, with a tendency to soften, due to the decline of American cotton and a pause in sales. Unexpectedly, the second and third sessions in the afternoon saw a wild jump, with merchants from Guangdong and Zhejiang in South China actively making purchases. At the same time, the price of raw cotton trended upward, boosting confidence. The sudden surge caused considerable tension. The middle two months of marked yarn surpassed the previous day's high price. The yarn market is being driven by real demand, and there is still upward momentum in the future.</p>
<p>(Significant Progress in Marked Yarn) In the morning session for marked yarn, the market opened with a downward trend in American cotton and a flat gold market. There was a lack of buyers in the market, and prices for various months fell by 3, 5, and 6 cents. The afternoon session opened flat, but the second and third sessions suddenly surged due to strong sales. Prices for various months increased by 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, and 1.5 cents. However, British factories seized the opportunity to release a large quantity of cotton yarn. The total transaction volume for the day was 38,100 bales. It was found that Jifeng sold 1,250 bales, Tongxing 850 bales, Yicheng 1,000 bales, Shenchang 700 bales, and Shenji 750 bales. Yichang sold 2,300 bales, Yiyu 2,200 bales, Changyu 800 bales, Xiesheng 600 bales, and Yukang 650 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>(3,274 Bales of Spot Yarn Transacted) Spot yarn sales remained robust, with the demand from Nambu merchants being the strongest.

<p>│Severe Shortage of Spot Goods, Difficulty Procuring Foreign Cotton│</p>
<p>The cotton market was calm in the morning due to the decline of American cotton and a flat gold market. Unexpectedly, in the second and third sessions in the afternoon, prices suddenly soared, and the situation was quite bullish, with short sellers appearing panicked. The reason cited was a severe shortage of spot goods and difficulties in procuring foreign cotton. At the same time, speculators unanimously inclined to purchase, causing the market to become increasingly high.</p>
<p>(Non-Industry Players Heavily Absorbing Forward Cotton) In the morning session for Zheng marked cotton, the market opened flat due to the fall of American cotton, with no fluctuations in prices for various months. In the afternoon, the second and third sessions saw a wild jump, with prices rising in all months by 4, 5, and 6 cents. The reason cited was that Chinese cotton production was estimated to be more than 2.7 million dan less than the previous estimate. In general, non-industry players were heavily absorbing forward contracts, causing the market to become even tighter. The total transaction volume for the day was 119,300 dan. Dachangcheng sold 3,800 dan, Dafu 1,900 dan, Shenxin 3,500 dan, Gengfeng 3,100 dan, Tonghe 8,100 dan, and Yuanda 2,600 dan.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to a lack of major buyers, Southern sales, and a sluggish Wall Street. Futures fell by 16 to 18 points, and spot goods fell by 20 points. British cotton futures rose by 15 to 17 points, and spot goods rose by 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 17 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to strong American cotton and Japanese purchases, but later weakened as the public sold at high prices.

<p>│Dalian Merchants Continue to Purchase 100,000 Bags of Spot and Forward Flour for January 10th Delivery│</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, prices for various months were generally stable. The quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly better, by a few cents or fractions of a dime, and both buyers and sellers mostly watched. Although the factories had a lot of foreign wheat chips, they were not very eager to sell, so the prices in each session stabilized. Until the opening in the afternoon, prices for the current month to March advanced sharply. Spot flour sales remained good, and Dalian merchants were very active. Yesterday, they also completed the purchase of 100,000 bags of spot and forward flour for January 10th delivery, at a price of 1 tael 9 dimes 2 and a half cents. As a result, confidence was rekindled, and buying interest was strong. The market from this month to March is exceptionally good. (Rumor has it that Dalian merchants have successively completed orders for about 600,000 to 700,000 bags of spot and forward flour. Due to factories still hedging in April and May, confidence has eased. After observing the follow-up, the tightness of spot flour may require a further increase in the near future. As a result, the current month rose by 2 cents compared to the previous day, January rose by 2 cents and 2.5 li, February rose by 1.5 cents, March rose by 1 cent and 7 li, April rose by 2.5 li, and May rose by 5 li.)</p>
<h3 id="e232">Wheat Market Slightly Soft <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the forward wheat market was flat and weak. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Canadian wheat, was slightly lower by one or two dimes. Although Chicago was slightly better by a few cents, it was very small. And because foreign wheat has been falling slightly for several days, the wheat market has been inactive, and traders' hedging has been active. Although the volume was not smooth, it seemed better than nothing. Therefore, confidence was slightly soft. However, there were few transactions in the current month and January, and no trading occurred. If traders continue to transact foreign wheat in the follow-up, hedging business may be smooth. As a result, there was no comparison for the current month and January, and February, March, and April were each down by 2 cents, and there was no comparison for May.</p>

<p>丨American Firms Completely Stalled</p>
<p>Transactions with American firms have completely stalled because the silk price has fallen by another 2 cents. Moreover, Chinese merchants are sticking to their bottom line and are unwilling to budge, so the prices quoted by foreign telegrams are very different, and no deals can be reached. Only Huangchuan silk is being traded with French firms. Baichang silk is also affected by the American situation and has not been traded.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, and other areas was actively purchased by British firms Xiehe, Jinlong, Tianyu, Tianxiang, etc., due to receiving telegrams from Morocco requesting supplies. A total of 2,083 boxes were traded in the city, and transactions were quite brisk. Currently, Jinlong, Jardine Matheson, and other firms have sent out large batches of Zhenmei telegrams. The general tea merchants and viewers expect the Zhenmei market to rebound. The Russian Aid Society also purchased a large quantity of Qimen black tea, 2,000 to 3,000 boxes, but the quoted price of 36 to 37 taels was too low, the silver payment period was too slow, and the conditions were too difficult to accept.</p>

<p>丨Number Plates Expanded and Held, Not Yet Opened丨Coarse Sand White Slightly Lower丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was slightly flat due to the rise in the gold standard. The guild set the price for number 24 coarse sand white at 15 taels 4 dimes and 7.5 cents, and some transactions occurred, only slightly lower by 2.5 cents compared to the previous day (14th). Changxing Firm offered 900 bags of number 18 middle-grade white sugar at a price of 14 taels 3 dimes and 2.5 cents, slightly lower by 2.5 cents compared to the previous day's set price. High-quality number 20 middle-grade sand white was sold out, and numbers 80, 90, and 100 Dutch red sugar remained mostly unchanged and lacked transactions. Chao merchants offered over 100 bags of lower-quality Mianhu red sugar at prices ranging from 10 taels 07 cents to 08 cents. Yesterday, it was reported that the Hesheng wheel had imported a new shipment of 2,890+ bags of Chaoqing sugar. Since there are bound to be even more shipments in the future, this newspaper has long predicted that the market price will inevitably fall. However, due to cost considerations, the numbered houses will still need to hold out for a considerable period of time before a new price can be determined. Therefore, the goods offered the day before will not be immediately affected.</p>
<p>According to a New York telegram on the 15th, spot goods were down slightly at 0625, at 8 and 3/8ths cents. Futures for December were down slightly at 6 points, January was down slightly at 4 points, March and May were each down by 2 points, and July and September were each down by 3 points. A London telegram reported that December was up by 0.75 points, and March and May were each up by 1.25. Sugar was down slightly, at 8 and a half pence (120 pounds).</p>

<p>— Shi Heng</p>
<p>This story begins on a Yangtze River steamer.</p>
<p>The river water was usually calm and tranquil, but the hearts of the passengers on the steamer were as restless as waves at sea.</p>
<p>Once, a young man boarded a steamer to go to a certain town upstream on the Yangtze River. His demeanor was extravagant, like that of a wealthy family's son. He booked a first-class cabin for two people.</p>
<p>Another man, in his thirties, seemed to coincidentally share the same room with him. Although this man's attire was also neat, someone with life experience could discern the ferocity in his features. However, his speech was very amiable, and within a few minutes, he had become very familiar with his roommate.</p>
<p>The ship sailed in the heart of the river.</p>
<p>On the deck, three or five passengers who appeared to be merchants stood chatting idly. Among them was an elderly man; one look at his attire was enough to know that he was an experienced traveler. However, this old man was upright, as evidenced by the bright gleam emanating from his eyes.</p>
<p>On the ship, it was as if everyone was in a large family; people easily became friendly. Soon, the extravagant young man also stood on the deck, conversing with the old man.</p>
<p>The old man sized up the wealthy young man, asking as if interrogating a criminal:</p>
<p>"You're a first-time traveler, aren't you?"</p>
<p>The young man indifferently smiled and responded.</p>
<p>"You should be careful," the old man continued. "This road is not easy. Young people often run into trouble."</p>
<p>Saying this, the old man spoke of many unfortunate incidents encountered on Yangtze River steamers and at the docks. Before he finished speaking, the young man's roommate, the middle-aged man, also joined them. He and the old man sized each other up, and the old man smiled at him in greeting, but then excused himself and walked away.</p>
<p>Night fell. The old man lay in his cabin, but it seemed as if something unusual was disturbing his heart. He couldn't fall asleep. His mind vividly and clearly reflected the faces of the fierce-looking middle-aged man and the extravagant young man. He thought to himself:</p>
<p>"This man definitely doesn't seem like a good person. His sharing a room with that young man is probably not coincidental, and he's being so friendly to him. I'm almost sixty years old; my eyes don't deceive me. That young man is in danger; I should help him! Fortunately, I'm in a neighboring room; I can listen carefully for any sounds from their room."</p>
<h3 id="e264">The Bribery Burial Pit <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Wang Honglie, the magistrate of Qiu'an County in Shandong, recently invented a new method for punishing corruption. He ordered the digging of a large pit in front of the county government, naming it the "Bribery Burial Pit." He also promulgated a decree: any official under the county government, from the magistrate down to the lowest employee, found to have accepted bribes, must throw themselves into the pit and bury themselves alive. If this were viewed solely from the perspective of "punishing corruption," it would naturally elicit applause and shouts of "wonderful!" However, if we further examine it from the standpoint of "rule of law," Magistrate Wang's "invention" is not only somewhat "illegal" but also seems to be deliberately toying with human lives.</p>
<p>Originally, the "official precepts" established in China were, as Ah Q would say, "too damn soft!" Despite the deafening calls for "building a clean government," the reality of "bribery being openly practiced" is still everywhere to be seen. As long as there is a "bribe," one can sell official positions, sell the law, and sell favors. This kind of buying and selling behavior has almost dominated the entire Chinese politics. The next step of "bribe" is "extortion," and the reality of extorting every drop of marrow is also everywhere to be seen. Under "bribe" and "extortion," there is no "law," no "government," only the scent of gold and silver, only the faces of demons and the tricks of ghosts. If there could be a large pit in this world to bury all kinds of bribery, to rescue "law" and "government" from piles of gold and silver, it would naturally be a great joy.</p>
<p>However, there will never be such a large pit in this world, and "bribery" is not just a simple "moral problem"; it is closely linked to the socio-economic system and can never be buried by a single pit. Taking a step back, there is still "national law" to punish corruption. Those who should be imprisoned are imprisoned, and those who should be beheaded are beheaded. Instead of handling it according to national law, digging a pit and ordering them to throw themselves in and bury themselves alive may be satisfying, but what about "rule of law"? As long as we close our eyes and silently imagine the tragedy of throwing oneself into the pit and burying oneself, our tongues will involuntarily stick out. Isn't this Magistrate Wang deliberately toying with human lives? Corruption is of course punishable by death, but is toying with human lives forgivable?</p>
<p>However, at present, there are many such "overcorrected" and playful behaviors. As long as you are happy, you can come up with an invention at any time, crack a joke at any time. Who cares?</p>
<h3 id="e265">Chinese and Japanese <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Ming</p>
<p>That was on March 4th of this year. At that time, China and Japan had almost stopped fighting. Our 19th Route Army had retreated to places like Changshu. On the evening of March 4th, suddenly there was news that our army had counterattacked and that the Japanese commander Shirakawa had been killed. At this time, the joy of some of our ordinary people was indescribable. Every family set off firecrackers, some people ran to the streets to cheer, and some even sat in cars or streetcars beating drums and gongs. The paper scraps from the firecrackers covered the road an inch or two thick, and the streets were literally packed with people. Some people cheered:</p>
<p>"Shirakawa is dead! Shirakawa is dead!"</p>
<p>Even those modern girls walking alone on the street were smiling. Why? Because Shirakawa was dead.</p>
<p>The Chinese are so lacking in the spirit of "fair play."</p>
<p>Reading the December issue of the Japanese "Shincho" magazine, there is an article by Akie Chikaumatsu entitled "An Outsider's View of the News," in which there is the following passage:</p>
<p>"In early August, I went from Tokyo to Nikko. By the time I arrived in Nikko, it was already evening. The people in this countryside were lined up, carrying lanterns, parading through the streets. I asked them what was going on, and they said that because Ma Zhanshan had died in battle, they were celebrating with lanterns. I couldn't help but smile."</p>
<p>Therefore, we know and are "relieved" that our "civilized" Japanese also lack the spirit of "fair play."</p>
<p>In this day and age, talking about "fair play" may be outdated, or at least a bit Don Quixote-ish. But somehow, this feeling is always endearing.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Rambling Words Facing the Wall <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Lingfeng</p>
<p>The moon is overhead.</p>
<p>I walked into the study that I hadn't entered for a long time. A kind of gloomy and stagnant air suddenly aroused a feeling of desolation and sorrow in my heart, making me feel as if I had walked into my own tomb. The joys and sorrows of the past were now quietly covered in the ruthless years.</p>
<p>Ten years of wandering, the remaining light illuminating empty flowers, having experienced all the illusions that young people are infatuated with. After everything has disappeared, only these half-wall of remaining books have left me with indelible traces. Facing each book on this shelf, I can imagine a lonely soul, guarding his own treasure in calm oblivion.</p>
<p>I pulled down a British novel that was popular seven years ago, blew away the dust sleeping on top, and opened the first page. On the yellowed paper, I saw a few lines of faint pencil writing:</p>
<p>"The moon hangs high, urging me to return home, the vast sea and blue sky are both indistinct. Ten years by the lake and sea, I feel much sorrow, again towards the southern sky, I ask what can be done."</p>
<p>Seven years ago, on a chilly early evening, sitting around the crimson fireplace, Li, whose wedding date had been set, took this book I was reading from my hand and left these few sentences on the blank page. She silently handed it to me, I glanced at it, and then quietly closed the book, squatting down to poke at the ashes in the fireplace. My young heart already knew how to cherish its own sorrow at that time, unwilling to give it away lightly.</p>
<p>Returning from walking in the moonlight, feeling the light cold, I chewed on the taste of helplessness that rippled in my heart, never having the courage to open that unfinished book again. Time flies, quietly seven years have passed. In these seven years, I have not had the opportunity to see her again, only indirectly heard from people that she is now flourishing like green leaves, with children in tow. Her virtuous heart has probably long brushed away that accidental gathering and scattering.</p>
<p>Facing these faint traces, holding the book, I stood quietly facing the wall. From the indifference, I was once again drawn into the net that I had woven myself. December 15th.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Strange Tales of Australian Aborigines <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Australia, located in the southwest of the South Pacific islands, is a British-claimed continent. The aborigines there are uncivilized people, divided into tribes, with a headman who dominates the people of each tribe with absolute power. The headman is sometimes hereditary; but usually, rare and exotic natural objects can be used as gifts to buy the position of headman. Among the aborigines, there is a type of person called a doctor. These people act as priests for various tribes, also perform like magicians, and sometimes even casually treat people's illnesses according to their own ideas, so they can indeed be considered useful doctors. The methods used by these doctors are mostly mystical: they use dreams and illusions to predict certain omens. In our view, although it is entirely a figment of the imagination, they believe it is a trick to use magic.</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>When a child is born in a tribe, they immediately calculate its fate to see if it can be kept alive. Most of the firstborn children are always killed. Also, if the previous child has not been weaned, then most of the later-born children are killed. (In practice, these children are also difficult to raise to adulthood.) According to statistics from the Australian government, one-third to one-half of newborn children are killed in this muddled way. The reason why some aborigines are willing to make such a sacrifice is because they believe that the killed child can be reborn as a person when the next child is born.</p>
<p>×××××</p>
<p>As for the children who are allowed to survive, they are very much loved. The mother often gives him milk until he is two or three years old; the father coaxes him every day. When the child grows up, the parents use various methods to make him happy. Therefore, the childhood of Australian aborigines is their happiest time. When they are nine or ten years old, this happy time comes to an end; girls, with a simple ceremony, leap into adulthood, and boys, with a more complicated ceremony, leap into adulthood. This ceremony varies from tribe to tribe: the simplest of which is the Kurnai tribe.</p>

<h3 id="e268">Court Ladies and Prostitutes <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Zhecun</p>
<p>I happened to see in the seventh issue of "Art Fortnightly" a reproduction of a work by the great French sculptor Rodin, with a Chinese title translated below as "Beautiful Old Court Lady." I couldn't help but slap the table in surprise. I don't remember Rodin ever doing a statue for any court lady. I have known this reproduced statue for a long time; it is Rodin's masterpiece, entitled "Beautiful Heaulmiere." Rodin created this strangely ugly statue entirely based on a poem by the ancient French poet Villon, "The Lament of the Beautiful Heaulmiere." Indeed, under the statue reproduced in "Art Fortnightly" was also noted a line "See translated poem in the fifth issue," so I went to find the fifth issue of "Art Fortnightly" and found a Chinese translation of Villon's poem on page seven. But the title was still "Beautiful Old Court Lady."</p>
<p>The word Heaulmiere comes from the word Heaulme. Heaulme is a kind of helmet in ancient times, Heaulmere can be translated as helmet maker! Ieaulmiere is the meaning of helmet maker's wife. This beautiful helmet maker's wife is a prostitute, a character in the French classical literature "Romance of the Rose." The poet Villon lamented the passing of youth and the impermanence of beauty, so he imagined this woman, who was once famous for her beauty, lamenting her fading beauty thirty years after her husband's death, turning into extremely poignant lyrics.</p>
<p>The gist of the first section of this poem is "I think I heard the beautiful woman who used to be the helmet maker's wife, she is regretting her youth, ah! Old age, cruel old age, why did you destroy my appearance so quickly? What else is there to miss, that makes me not want to kill myself." Singing to this point, the elderly beauty looked at her shrunken skin and withered arms, and couldn't help but recall the snowy skin and flower-like face of the past. So the gist of the second section onwards is "Ah, he has been dead for more than thirty years, now only I am left, an old woman. I think about the good old days; how beautiful I was then. How am I now, when I look at my naked body, the appearance is much thinner, withered, weak and trembling, I am really furious. Where has my soft, smooth forehead gone? Where have my golden hair and beautiful eyes gone? Where has my moderate nose gone? Where have my small ears, my delicate face, my vermilion lips gone?" The following are two sections of poems that try their best to describe an aging prostitute, singing in sequence, the shoulders, arms, eyebrows, eyes, nose, limbs, breasts are all gaunt, dry, withered, shrunken, and dull. "This is the end of human beauty!" In the last section, the poet wrote such a warning.</p>
<p>The sculptor Rodin specifically used the appearance described in this poem as a blueprint to create his masterpiece. We should naturally read Villon's poem while carefully looking at Rodin's sculpture. It is easy to appreciate the advantages of the expression methods of these two arts. Unfortunately, "Art Fortnightly" did not translate the entire original poem, and Rodin's works cannot be seen in China. These are inevitably some shortcomings. As for translating both titles as court ladies, that is completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>He was drinking milk when he saw Madam Hezi also carrying a cup of milk, biting a piece of bread, walking up with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, is there too little bread?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin must not be happy eating breakfast alone. That's why I came up to accompany you to eat together. May I?"</p>
<p>He tilted his head slightly and said with a smile.</p>
<p>"You have guests; you should go down and accompany them."</p>
<p>Haiquan wanted to say a few more blunt words to satirize her. But he couldn't think of any at the moment. Some were too harsh, for fear of provoking her anger.</p>
<p>"Is there enough milk to drink?"</p>
<p>"I have more here."</p>
<p>"Have more? Let me drink it?"</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to drink it?"</p>
<p>Madam Hezi really walked over, picked up his milk cup, took two sips, and put it back.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, why don't you have any smile today? I won't go down until I see you smile."</p>
<p>After she said this, he couldn't help but smile.</p>
<p>"Please finish drinking that cup of milk."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"You really are an interesting child! Mr. Lin, please come early after school today, lest I look forward to you. Don't be as late as last night."</p>
<p>As she spoke, she went downstairs. Seeing her leave, Haiquan felt like he had lost something.</p>
<p>He closed his room door, carrying his schoolbag, just about to go downstairs when he suddenly saw the nanny bring up an invitation. He took it and looked at it; it was:</p>
<p>A modest vegetarian feast will be served at five o'clock in the afternoon on December 5th.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ren Jinhua Liu Peizhen</p>
<p>Residence: 45, Lane H, Avenue Joffre</p>
<p>(Nine)</p>
<p>Haiquan looked at the invitation again and again, as if wanting to find some means of revenge against Madam Hezi from this invitation, also like wanting to seek cheerleaders from this invitation, because he felt like he was on stage, and soon he would start wrestling with that oriental wearing a Japanese kimono. Who would be his backup.</p>
<p>"Should I take this invitation with me, or leave it at home?"</p>
<p>He hesitated greatly for this question. At the same time, he hoped to see Madam Hezi come down from upstairs, so that he could show her this invitation, as a demonstration. But he waited for a while and still didn't see Madam Hezi come down. Seeing that the time for class was approaching, he gave the invitation to the nanny.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Prosperous Cities <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>I am not absolutely opposed to prosperous cities, I just feel that the countryside should not be forgotten either. China is founded on agriculture, and has not paid much attention to industrial and commercial cities since ancient times, so that the practice of rural market fairs prevailed in past dynasties, gathering commodities at a certain suitable location at a set time for trading. According to Mayor Wu, municipal administration in China began in Guangzhou, in February 15, 1921, when the Guangdong Provincial Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Guangzhou City, dividing it into municipal administrative districts. It can also be seen that it is only recently that our country has paid attention to the prosperity and facilities of cities, which is quite lamentable.</p>
<p>Recently, the people of our country have paid great attention to the prosperity of cities. A few days ago, I read Mayor Wu's speech on Greater Shanghai, which aroused deep illusions in me. Yesterday, I also saw in the newspaper that the Beijing Municipal Government had drafted a plan to prosper the city of Beijing, and had submitted the plan to the central government for approval. The outline is divided into nine items, including society, public security, and property. The Guangdong Provincial Government has also drafted a new plan to prosper the Guangzhou urban area, designating Dashatou as a commercial development area, saying that to seek prosperity, entertainment venues must first be equipped, and to develop entertainment venues, smoking rooms, gambling halls, and brothels must first be ordered to relocate, with heavy taxes levied on violators. It is said to be an excellent method of discouraging through taxation, which made me sigh with admiration after reading it.</p>
<p>Standing on the position of prosperous cities, I express my approval of the Greater Shanghai Plan and the Plan to Prosper Beijing. However, the plan of Guangdong to prosper the urban area is no different from publicly advocating that people learn to smoke, gamble, and prostitute. I can only wait and see the future, and I dare not agree rashly for the time being.</p>
<p>However, I still have a further point to say, that is, we should not completely forget the countryside for the sake of prosperous cities! I know that China's cities are not as prosperous as those in Europe and the United States. Not to mention the smaller ones, even the top-notch Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou are still ashamed in many ways, and it is indeed necessary to quickly prosper, but it must be known that cities are just a microcosm of the countryside, a concentration of rural agricultural products and an economic hub. In the final analysis, it should start with the prosperity of the countryside. Our country has a natural environment of vast land and sparse population, and a mild climate. Since ancient times, it has been famous as an agricultural country, producing rice, tea, silk, and other products, which not only provides for its own use, but also sells a large amount overseas. Tea, silk, and porcelain have always held the world's leading position. Among the grains, the soybeans of the Northeast have also been exported in large quantities, which is not uncommon for a wealthy national economy.</p>
<p>Now, foreign tea merchants barely dare accept it, and exports have almost disappeared. The right to silkworm silk has been given to the slave country to seize. The porcelain of Jiangxi is not much exported either. What is most distressing is that food has actually occupied the top position in imported goods. Alas, China founded on agriculture, how can this be endured.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the bankruptcy of the countryside. The political system is not on track, the forces of international capitalism have penetrated into the countryside, bandits are rampant, and natural disasters are frequent, all of which are the main reasons. However, most people only care about running towards the city, and the government only cares about the prosperity of the city, resulting in a chaotic situation of priorities and the increasing poverty of society. This can also be regarded as one of the biggest causes of rural bankruptcy! Therefore, after reading the prosperity plans of the three major cities of Shanghai, Beijing, and Guangzhou, I can't help but have some feelings, and now I want to shout.</p>
<p>"Don't forget the countryside when prospering cities."</p>

<h3 id="e271">The Method of Making Blueprint Paper <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Er Ming</p>
<p>In recent years, engineering and construction have been developing rapidly, and the art of drawing and planning has also become increasingly popular. Each project requires several copies of drawings, and many require dozens or hundreds of copies. Manual copying is impossible, and stone printing is too expensive. Therefore, blueprint paper has become a necessity in modern engineering and construction. In addition, universities with engineering and technical schools, railway bureaus, and water conservancy bureaus, as well as photography, all rely heavily on this paper. However, the manufacturing of blueprint paper is not difficult, and I will describe it below.</p>
<p>Preparation of the Blueprint Paper Solution: This paper requires two solutions to be mixed together. ㈠ Potassium Ferricyanide Solution, also known as Red Prussiate of Potash deep liquid. ㈡ Ammonium Ferric Citrate Solution, also known as deep liquid of Ammonia and Iron Citrate.</p>
<p>For the usual preparation of these two salt solutions, dissolve them separately and then combine them. The first chemical should be ground into a fine powder. The second chemical is usually in pure form and dissolves easily. It can become solid at all times, but it dissolves when exposed to moisture. After a few days, it softens and becomes unusable. Therefore, the amount of this chemical to be prepared should be determined by the amount to be used (must be prepared in a dark room).</p>
<p>Amount of Dissolution and Combination: There are different methods for combining, but the most suitable amounts are as follows:</p>
<p>First Solution: One ounce of Red Prussiate of Potash (equivalent to 7.61 qian in Kuping weight) and six ounces of water, or two and a half ounces of Red Prussiate of Potash and one pint of water (equivalent to 0.61 liters, weighing approximately 12.67 liang). After this liquid is completely dissolved, filter it (using raw cotton for speed).</p>
<p>Second Solution: One and a half ounces of Ammonium Ferric Citrate and six ounces of water, or four ounces of Iron Citrate and one pint of water. After this liquid is completely dissolved, it must also be filtered until it is very clear. The first and second solutions should be stored separately in glass bottles with glass stoppers and placed in a dark room for use. When using, combine the two liquids in equal parts and filter again carefully to prevent any Red Prussiate of Potash powder from remaining in the liquid. If this mixed liquid changes from brown to light blue-green, it should not be used. Every four ounces of this mixed solution can be used to make paper with an area of one hundred square feet, costing only one or two jiao in洋.</p>
<p>Paper Material for Making Blueprint Paper: Ordinary paper that is strong and washable is sufficient. For printing fine drawings, paper that is fine, strong, smooth, and uniform, and that the solution cannot penetrate through to the back, is preferable. Otherwise, the liquid will penetrate the paper and cause a chemical reaction, and the image will not appear even after washing. German Saxe paper and French Rives paper are excellent for making this type of paper. Other high-quality options include Weston's and Scottish Seoteh's linen paper, which have the tightest texture. All of the above papers must be imported from foreign countries, and our country does not have them, which is truly regrettable. However, if there are domestically made papers that are strong and smooth, a small amount can be tested. If good results are obtained, it can be used as a substitute.</p>
<p>Order of Dyeing Paper with Solution: Dyeing paper with the solution must be done in a dark room. The so-called dark room does not have to be completely dark, but it must have a slight amount of light or a square of red glass embedded in the wall to allow light to pass through. The solution only needs to dye one side of the paper. There are two methods of applying the dye, which are described below:</p>
<p>㈠ Floating Dyeing Method: Place the solution in a large, shallow basin with a flat bottom. Float the paper on the surface of the liquid, with the front side of the paper touching the solution. When floating the paper, hold two opposite corners of the paper with both hands so that the other two opposite corners touch the surface of the liquid. Lower one of the held corners first, then lower the other. After the entire paper touches the liquid, flip half of the paper over to check for air bubbles. If there are any, re-touch the paper to the surface of the liquid and drag it from side to side. The half without air bubbles can be flipped up and does not need to touch the liquid. After the entire paper has been floating on the liquid surface for about one or two minutes, it can be taken out and hung next to the water basin to allow the remaining liquid to drain away. The result of this method is good, and it all depends on the skill of the operation. The shallow square basin used for dyeing paper must be larger than the paper being dyed, and there must be room for movement around it. The inside of the basin must not only be leak-proof but also resistant to chemical reactions to be considered good.</p>
<p>㈡ Brush Dyeing Method: Lay the paper flat on a flat board, with a soft, smooth oilcloth between the paper and the board. Dip a wide, soft brush into the solution and evenly brush the surface of the paper, repeating two or three times. This method</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>is the simplest, but it must be done quickly. If one side is not dyed and the other side is already dry, then this paper is useless. If dyeing long and large paper, two people are required. First, use a wet brush to quickly dye the paper once, then use a light brush to brush across the surface of the paper to squeeze out the wet water, and then apply the liquid so that it is deeply and evenly spread. Rapid dyeing can achieve good results. After the dyeing is complete, clamp one side of the paper to a horizontal pole and hang it in a dark room to dry.</p>
<p>Preservation of Blueprint Paper: After the paper is made, it must be carefully stored in a dark and dry place. Small ones should be placed flat in wooden or paper boxes, and large ones should be rolled up and stored in paper or lead tubes, etc., covered and sealed to prevent decay for a long time. The finished paper must never be folded. Once folded, the surface of the paper will be uneven and unusable.</p>

<p>— Yin Ming</p>
<p>There was an old scholar who went to the capital to take the exam. Every time he wrote a letter to his wife, the wording was very "verbose." His wife therefore wrote a letter to him, telling him not to be "verbose" in his letters in the future. He then concentrated on writing a "non-verbose" letter. His letter is as follows:</p>
<p>In the past, I was verbose, but today I will no longer be verbose. Verbose language is annoying, so I have deleted it.</p>
<p>The newly built city gate tower in Nanjing has wind chimes on all four corners. The wind makes them ring loudly, ding-ding-dang-dang, dang-dang-ding-ding, which is very different from the guest room in our house.</p>
<p>If I pass the exam this time, then you will be a madam, the eldest son will be the eldest young master, the second son will be the second young master, the third son will be the third young master, the fourth son will be the fourth young master, and the fifth son will be the fifth young master; if I do not pass the exam, then you will still be a wife, the eldest son will still be the eldest son, the second son will still be the second son, the third son will still be the third son, the fourth son will still be the fourth son, and the fifth son will still be the fifth son. There is a pair of cotton shoes in the box. Take them out to dry in the sun, beat them, and pat them. Pat them and beat them to prepare for the cold weather.</p>
<p>When your period comes, be sure not to stand outside the door and be seen by Wang Er Mazi across the street, lest he have bad intentions. A thousand times, ten thousand times, in my haste, I didn't have time to write the "cao" (草) radical, so I used a big square with a dot removed to represent it.</p>

<p>Shop Employees' Correspondence</p>
<h3 id="e273">Suggestions for Solving Reading Problems <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am not a shop employee, and I am not very clear about the lives of shop employees. Recently, after reading your "Shop Employees' Correspondence," it aroused my sympathy for the suffering of shop employees.</p>
<p>Today (December 14), you raised four questions, asking everyone to express their opinions; I am a teacher, so I will talk about the second question.</p>
<p>"How can shop employees, apprentices, and trainees satisfy their desire for knowledge?"</p>
<p>I think: For this question, if the following method is adopted, a considerable solution can definitely be obtained at present. What method?</p>
<p>"Organize shop employees' reading clubs by shop employees, apprentices, and trainees who are aspiring to improve. Create a mobile library by the reading club."</p>
<p>Now let me explain why this method should be used:</p>
<p>First, because shop employees have very little time to read every day: to reduce the time spent running around borrowing and returning books, the only way is to create a mobile library.</p>
<p>Second, because the libraries that already exist in Shanghai at present, the books inside are not specially equipped for shop employees, nor are they equipped based on the actual needs of shop employees.</p>
<p>Those that meet the actual needs of shop employees are also plagued by too few books, making it inconvenient to circulate. Therefore, it is best for shop employees to create a mobile library that they really need themselves.</p>
<p>Third, to create a mobile library, money is essential. However, if this is done by one person, it will naturally be difficult; if it is done by many people, it will be an easy task. Therefore, it is necessary to first organize reading clubs by shop employees, and then set up libraries.</p>
<p>The above is the result of my thinking at the moment, and naturally the thinking cannot be thorough. For example, the following questions have not been adequately resolved:</p>
<p>㈠ How to obtain reading time for shop employees?</p>
<p>㈡ What is the internal organization of the reading club?</p>
<p>㈢ What is the internal organization of the library?</p>
<p>However, I think these questions should not be discussed in too much detail for the time being. The most important thing now is:</p>
<p>"Just organize with two or three people!"</p>
<p>Because only after organizing will methods that meet the public will be produced! Only methods that are publicly recognized are possible!</p>
<p>Editor! What do you think?</p>
<p>Shop employees, apprentices, and trainees! What do you think?</p>
<p>Zhang Jianhua, December 14</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Zhang believes that to satisfy the desire for knowledge of shop employees, it is necessary to establish a mobile library. This question is precisely what we have been constantly concerned about and have already obtained a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>To commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of our newspaper, we have specially established a circulating library on the third floor, numbers 345, of the Continental Shopping Mall on Nanjing Road, a commercially central location with convenient transportation, with the primary purpose of supporting industrial and commercial education. Therefore, the three questions raised by Mr. Zhang have all been easily solved.</p>
<p>㈠ The library has a delivery method: employees are hired to deliver books directly to the borrowers' places, free of charge. Shop employees can sit in the shop all day and still have ample opportunity to borrow books.</p>
<p>㈡ At the beginning of the library's opening, an announcement was published on the cover of our newspaper: readers are welcome to inform us at any time of the names and publishing locations of their favorite books so that we can purchase them. This will ensure that the books placed in the library can meet the needs of shop employees.</p>
<p>㈢ The economic aspect is entirely the responsibility of our newspaper, so there is naturally no problem.</p>
<p>As for the question of the shop employees' reading club, it is best for the shop employees themselves to come up with a solution, and we are very willing to do our best to support them. Moreover, we very much agree with Mr. Zhang's suggestion regarding the scope of the organization of this type of club. The number of people does not need to be large, and three or four people can organize it (in fact, the number of people should not be too large). It seems that this is not an impossible task, and we are very willing to hear news of such an organization among the readers as soon as possible to solve our intellectual hunger and depression.</p>

<p>— Ming Ming</p>
<p>It was about Monday morning, after the memorial week was over, followed by the unbearably noisy Chinese class.</p>
<p>Before long, the class bell rang, and after five minutes, the students outside the classroom slowly entered the dull classroom one by one. Suddenly, the sound of leather shoes clattering outside the classroom reached our classroom. Looking up, "Ha!" The classmates in the classroom shouted in unison, and even the students with nearsightedness quickly took out their glasses and put them on their noses to see what was happening.</p>
<p>It turned out that the Chinese teacher, who usually loved simplicity, had completely changed his attire today. He was wearing a red-knotted melon-skin hat on his head, a green silk cotton robe on his body, and a large floral satin mandarin jacket on top. The cloth-bottomed shoes he brought from the countryside were also gone, and he was actually wearing clattering leather shoes. Looking at these half-new and half-old leather shoes, he had never worn them before. They were probably淘 from the famous old goods market in Shanghai. So, among the students, there was one nicknamed Little Monkey, known for his mischievousness. Seeing the Chinese teacher's rural modernized appearance today, he gave him a nickname called "Little Tang Ming." The whole class burst into laughter again.</p>
<p>Amidst the students' loud laughter and commotion, the teacher opened the register and began to call names. He used all the strength he had when he was breastfeeding as a child to finish calling the names of more than forty people. As a result, everyone was present, even the sick student who had not gotten out of bed for a long time was there today. The teacher, regardless of anything, opened the textbook and began to explain the page that had not been finished last time. In this always disliked Chinese class, who would listen? So, some were holding pens and bowing their heads writing love letters, some were looking at pictures of their loved ones, and some were holding pens and filling them with ink, writing complaints in the newspaper. In this class, there was everything imaginable.</p>
<p>The teacher, who was called Little Tang Ming, explained with relish, shaking his head and swaying his tail, expressing his criticisms and opinions. Later, it became too noisy, making the "Little Tang Ming" teacher jump up and put the red-knotted hat on his head on the podium. This release caused the whole class of students to laugh wildly again. Just when things were in this awkward state, suddenly the life-saving bell rang. So the teacher shouted loudly, saying, "I'll spare you this time, but you must never do this again." He immediately put on his hat, grabbed his books, and ran away. So the students all shouted in unison, "One...Two...Three, Little Tang Ming..."</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Just because of watching this scene, I was delayed, so that even though I took the night train, there were no sleeping cars available; I had no choice but to put my sick body, which I had barely managed to get out of bed, into an ordinary first-class carriage. But unexpectedly, this one mistake allowed me, after abandoning everything, to encounter an unexpected adventure.</p>
<p>Beautiful little darling! What kind of adventure do you think it was? Could there be anyone besides you worth me calling an adventure? No! No! It was just too coincidental, which is why I called it an adventure.</p>
<p>As I stepped into the carriage, I sat down very quickly on a single seat as if I had a case of hypochondria. I immediately hid my head in my raised coat collar, cowering in a corner. I didn't distinguish clearly what kind of people were sitting around me, whether they were men, women, old, or young. I just felt that they were all people.</p>
<p>"Hi! Mr. Zhu!" The car had been running for three or four minutes when a very crisp and familiar voice suddenly spoke very fluently directly across from me: at the same time, five very slender fingers boldly pulled open the coat collar that was covering my face.</p>
<p>This very ordinary little action caused me a great shock, as if I had encountered some kind of major change, and I almost jumped up from my seat. My eyes, as if annoyed, stared round and wide, but the shadow of the person only two feet away from me was still very blurry.</p>
<p>Ah, dear little brother, to tell you the truth: if a timid friend had seen my condition at that time, he might have sent me to the International Funeral Home immediately.</p>
<p>"Hi! Mr. Zhu! Are you sick?" The person sitting across from me, who first greeted me, also immediately noticed that I was sick.</p>
<p>Although he had already called the word "Mr." followed by my surname very clearly twice in the tone of an American gentleman, I still couldn't remember which close friend he was. However, I had already recognized clearly that she was a she, not a he.</p>
<p>Thankfully, someone with courage in the back opened a glass window, regardless of public opinion, allowing the sharp and fierce night wind to rush into the carriage one after another. I happened to be right in the line of fire, and the wind swirled around the back of my neck: before long, I was already shivering, and my head became clear. Immediately, a lady appeared before me, so modernized that others couldn't tell whether she was a prostitute or a virtuous woman. Red rouge, white powder, and green黛 had joined forces to cover her true face; a杏yellow silk旗pao was so tight that it seemed to be one with her flesh, revealing her curves as much as possible; and she was wearing a foreign wool spring coat on her back that was not practical but only for decoration.</p>
<p>After all, who is she? This person is not only someone you would never guess; even I almost thought it wasn't real in the first five minutes. Because she came so unexpectedly!</p>
<p>Don't worry, dear little brother, let me tell you! She is none other than your Lawyer Zhou's old lover丨丨Miss Li Fang. Isn't that strange?</p>
<p>Even stranger is that ever since this dear classmate of ours left school and heartlessly abandoned Da Jing, although I had a childishly ridiculous idea of finding her and scolding her thoroughly, I had never encountered her. Who would have thought that at this final juncture, we would meet face to face as if by some ghostly trick.</p>

<h3 id="e277">Joan Crawford's Secret to Success <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>Joan Crawford, Mrs. Fanpengke, who has returned from her trip to Europe, is now very different from before. She has been embraced by the people of the United States, occupying one of the top ten stars in Hollywood, and for several years, the mysterious queen of嘉賓 has been trending to relinquish her寶座, for sure. The current Joan Crawford has reached the peak of success, but the success of a career is by no means accidental. She has a beautiful face, a moderate figure, and wonderful eyebrows, and a square and broad mouth, many features. She has嘉賓's mystery, but these are not the key to her success.</p>
<p>Unlike others who only like to be flattered, she welcomes fair criticism. She often says, "Of course, there are things wrong with everything about me. Severe criticism gives me the opportunity to improve. I can't force everyone to agree with me, but I fully accept fair public opinion." Therefore, she has always maintained a modest and self-effacing attitude towards any reporter's interview.</p>
<p>She is not only polite to reporters, but she is also very polite to everyone, so no one in Hollywood dislikes being close to her. She and her husband, Mr. Fanpengke, have never had a conflict, and they still maintain the honor of being a "model couple" in Hollywood.</p>

<p>After her success with the trilogy "Yellow Passport," "Woman in Room 13," and "Living Hell," the American media praised her to the skies. Of course, we must also admit that she is worth praising. Recently, she joined Cecil B. DeMille's "The Sign of the Cross" as a major role, playing a Christian girl. DeMille selected her after many reviews and said, "No star is more qualified to play the role of Mercia except her."</p>

<h3 id="e279">Night After Night <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>If someone gave you a script like this: saying that there is a nouveau riche young man who opened a舞場 that sells "private wine". He meets a girl, 丨 this girl is the former owner of this big hotel house, 丨 in this environment of feasting every day and singing every night, they both abandon their old loves and fall in love with each other. In his moment of triumph, the hotel is destroyed by hooligans, 丨 the story ends here,</p>
<p>Of course, you know that the young man must have all the beautiful qualities of a man; he must be dignified and luxurious; he must be lively and vigorous, and the girl must have mystery and passionate “Jt” in addition to her appearance. The performances and casting are extremely difficult, and yet, within such a plot, it must be directed into a tense but humorous romantic comedy,</p>
<p>You think this is extremely difficult, even incomprehensible, but Paramount Pictures has done it and has achieved perfect results. Don't you believe it? "Night After Night", which Guanglu started showing yesterday, is a film as I said above,</p>
<p>The director uses skillful techniques and lenses to move forward step by step from extremely bland narratives, imperceptibly attracting people. Guanglu can only be considered good, because in the eight-thousand-foot film, there is no way to get away from this hotel, the most difficult male lead is George Raft, who is known as Valentino II, he fits the conditions I said above very well, I think everything about him is somewhat like Ramon Novarro, the results are very good, playing a man surrounded by women "just like the person", the girl is Constance Cummings, I don't remember what film she starred in; but I believe that she is not a star who is just on the screen for the first time, because no one can be so sophisticated as soon as they enter the screen, the rest of the actors are too good, sorry I can't write them one by one,</p>
<p>The good thing is the organization of the film, I have already said it, the editing is extremely exquisite, and the set is worth mentioning, it is not a strange and unique greatness, it is just ordinary and extremely gorgeous, but it is already extremely extravagant; assisted by the aristocratic performance, it adds endless rich and magnificent colors, calling people have a sense of beauty, its "small fun" humor 丨, there is no place that does not have it, but many are hidden in the dialogue, people who do not understand English will suffer a loss, 丨 lose many laughable opportunities,</p>
<p>The plot can be divided into two points; first, it is described that the American Prohibition Association's enforcement is lax, and the modern American sale of alcohol is rampant. The people's hobbies and the original intention of setting the law are exactly the opposite of the effect. Second, it is said that in recent years, people's attitudes towards "money" and "love" are absolutely different from the past, which further proves the improvement of the world 丨 丨 is it getting better or worse? It is best to think for yourself,</p>
<p>Maybe I said it too much: of course, I dare not say that it is particularly good; but it can never be said that it is not good, 丨 especially it is produced under difficult conditions, so it is precious,</p>
<h3 id="e280">Dutch Cinemas Do Not Admit Children <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Dutch children are not as lucky as children in our country. Because cinemas there seem to be places for adults to spend their time, ordinary films are absolutely prohibited for children under the age of eighteen to visit. However, this is a rule set by their government, not like some cinemas in Shanghai, which use the prohibition of children to visit as advertising. Sometimes when Dutch cinemas encounter films that are specially allowed for children to visit, the cinemas will advertise them widely, and the children are all very happy because they see movies too few times, only three or four times a year!</p>
<p>New Movie Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e281">General Yan's Bitter Tea (Part 2) <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Crane</p>
<p>Thunderbolt from a Clear Sky: Because of Mary's collusion with the enemy, the enemy forces at the front line suddenly gained an advantage, and a huge amount of public grain was seized by them. General Yan thus encountered difficulties both militarily and economically. The soldiers lacked morale, and the main forces retreated in disarray.</p>
<p>General Yan was defeated. Megau wanted to leave with him, but he told her to go first, because even if he were captured by his enemies, she could escape safely.</p>
<p>Farewell! Megan got into the plank boat, but General Yan stood still on the shore, holding a gun in his hand, waving and telling the sailors to set sail. The shouts of the rebel soldiers grew closer, and Megan was almost driven mad with fear.</p>
<p>General Yan sacrificed his own life to save a foreign girlfriend whom he respected.</p>
<p>In this way, the leaders of the internal strife can rest assured, because this film does not bring out their individuality, but portrays them as gentle, affectionate heroes.</p>
<p>As for the civil war, it is of course depicted accurately, with the flames of war, tragic cries, and refuge-seeking, but all of these are unique products of China, to which we are accustomed. Moreover, with such an affectionate general, perhaps it can correct foreigners' impression of the cruel and tyrannical warlords of our country. The remaining scenes of poetic moonlit nights and the sweet nothings whispered between the hero and the beautiful woman are even more thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also shortcomings, such as General Yan wearing a robe-like outer garment at home, and Mary's clothing being completely out of step with modern Chinese women today. In addition, the government offices that look like vegetable decorations and the large-scale bombing by aircraft, which have never been used in any internal war, are inevitably criticized for being unrealistic or superfluous. The most regrettable thing is that they did not use Chinese-American actresses such as Anna May Wong or Violet Wong to play Mary Corner, but instead used Toshi Mori, a Japanese Tokyo Sakura Girl. She has no knowledge of China, which makes her completely out of character, and the whole film is inferior because of it.</p>
<p>Finally, I earnestly implore the Film Censorship Board not to prohibit the screening of this excellent film in China, so that we can all feast our eyes and see this affectionate General Yan. Even if not, we can also see whether the Americans' impression of China has improved at all. (End)</p>
<p>Film Review of National Films</p>
<h3 id="e282">"Tears of Red in the Empty Gate" <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Yan</p>
<p>This is a masterpiece from the silent era of Tianyi (Film Company). I never expected it to be released at this time.</p>
<p>Plot</p>
<p>It tells the story of a woman who is oppressed and powerless to resist, who is forced by the dark society to take refuge in Buddhism, lightly and easily sacrificing a lifetime of happiness in a nunnery. In terms of the times, this is an outdated work, but in the sincere mind of the character Xiuhua, because of her situation and education, she naturally cannot think of a better refuge. Modern women would all think her thinking is backward. Apart from this small point, when we combine the plot of the entire drama, although it is not very good, it can be considered a good production in the silent era of Tianyi. Because it was produced last spring.</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>There are many ideas, but there are also many places where it imitates foreign films, but the application is not forced. It seems that in the scene where Chen Yumei is hit by a car, she lies too unnaturally. It does not look like she was knocked down and lying there. This is some carelessness. When Sun Min and Chen Yumei return from the hospital, they seem to have been home for a long time, because Sun Min changed into a blue suit, and Yumei's pigtails became a fan-shaped bun. This is a small point of negligence. In addition, scenes such as Xiao Zhengzhong and Ma Dongwu's hair turning white in one shot all lack careful explanation.</p>
<p>Performance</p>
<p>Chen Yumei is very ordinary in the first half and very delicate in the second half. Shu Lijuan is naturally good at playing fierce women, and she does it more crisply in this film than in "Little Actress." Sun Min cannot find any wonderful parts, but he is very steady. Zhang Zhenduo and Qin Haha love to act too much, so they inevitably have the problem of "inserting candles" in civilized dramas. Ge Fu's performance is most suitable for the identity. Jiang Naifang and Xu Jingzhen can act according to their personality. Ma Dongwu and Xiao Zhengzhong have no major flaws, but the male disguise as a female is a bit nauseating.</p>
<p>Makeup</p>
<p>Chen Yumei is the best. She can clearly distinguish the times. Ma Dongwu's face is also very natural.</p>
<p>Photography</p>
<p>The technique is not bad. "Change" and "composite printing" are very clean, but the light is too strong and the reflection is dazzling, which is very annoying.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Scenery <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>The nunnery and the small street scene are very realistic in these two scenes, especially the road and alley in a heavy snowstorm, which are perfectly arranged, and the rest are ordinary. Conclusion In summary of the above points, it cannot be said that this is not a progressive work by Tianyi. Flaws are inevitable in any work, but I hope that the people of Tianyi will work hard as much as possible. Chen Yumei's nickname Yun Tianyi's Chen Yumei, her nickname is called "Bao Bao." When she first entered the film industry, she worked as an actor at the Dongfang Film Company founded by Mr. Zhang Boren, and at that time she was called "Chen Linfeng." Later, she was appreciated by Shao Zuiweng, the general manager of Tianyi Company, and joined Tianyi Company, and changed her name to "Yumei." After Mr. Shao's efforts to promote her, she is now the mainstay of Tianyi Company. Film Treatise "Playing False as Real" Chen Dabei I have said earlier that we Chinese people, because of our complex bloodline, have a naturally stronger ability to imitate than people of pure blood. Therefore, we should have the greatest contribution in the art of performance. But the fact is just the opposite. Why is that? In my opinion, this is because we are not good at practicing the four words "playing false as real." Europeans and Americans surpass us in the most obvious place, which is that they are good at "playing false as real." This is not only the case on the stage and on the screen, but even in daily life, they can make every play that they know is false come alive as if it were real. People who live in Shanghai only need to take a look at a foreigner's funeral, and then take a look at a Chinese person's funeral, and they will understand. You see, almost every relative and friend at their funerals can fully express a kind of sadness on their faces. The relatives and friends at our Chinese funerals hold a stick of incense in their hands, and their mouths are either biting on a cigarette or chattering and laughing with their companions, almost forgetting what they are doing on the road. Then compare the solemn atmosphere in their churches with the pairs of sly eyes of the monks and Taoists who set off fireworks in our streets and alleys. In this kind of thing, no matter which world you run into, you can find some evidence that our people are not good at "playing false as real." Why is the performing arts of Europe and the United States so developed? It is because they have opportunities to practice "playing false as real" everywhere away from the stage, because they perform their plays greatly in social life.</p>
