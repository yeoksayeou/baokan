<h3 id="c1">最近義勇軍總攻之形勢　梓· <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>八月一日以來。我東北義勇軍向满鐡沿線各地日軍之總攻擊·其給與吾人之與奮。與半年前十九路軍一二八上海抗日之戰。殆相彷佛。吾人於興奮中觀察戰局形勢。覺目前義勇軍聲勢壯盛。捷報頻傳。固足使人聞風欣慰。而關於將來眞正之勝利。則尙須附有相當之條件。興奮中之國人似應注意及之也。</p>
<p>義勇軍總攻擊中之戰線北起長春南及蓋平並於西方佔通遼以作呼應。最近戰事中心集於遼陽鞍山海城大石橋蓋平營口　帶。此即三十七年前中日遼東戰事决定勝負之地也。遼陽爲瀋陽南面屏障。其東有摩天嶺。爲遼東險要。海城爲遼東東路山嶺盡頭。蓋平爲遼東南路山嶺盡頭。大石橋爲海城蓋平間孔道。東南山嶺絡繹。此皆利於義勇軍作戰之地義勇軍利用各地山嶺。分路進攻。日軍應付不遑。手足無措。向以满鐡附屬地爲安樂天國之日僑。至此亦不能安居。向以满鐡屬地爲無人敢犯之日軍警。至此亦大爲張皇。然此皆爲　時之形勢。本莊繁向日京請調援軍兩師團。日政府已復電准許矣。三十七年前日軍曾先據海城。與我宋慶吳大徴周旋於此帶地方。經三閱月之久對於地勢亦應有相當之明瞭。吾人推測。此兩師團之日軍到達時。義勇軍之作戰。必將大感困難。此爲戰事前途之最可使人憂惶者。</p>
<p>目前第一重要之條件。當然爲山海關熱河兩方之出兵響應。惟吾人依事勢推測。此項望。萬無達到之可能。其次。讓義勇軍獨力作戰。其必要之條件。則爲趕於日方大軍未到以前。奪取可以會師之地點。會師以後。一面集中數部實力。於統指揮之下。與日軍作旗鼓相當之戰爭。而一面以餘部各就原有根據地。沿用游擊戰法。以擾日軍後方。如此勝負之數。雖未可知。持久之計。或不外是矣。更次。義勇軍應早作準備。厚集物資。鞏固各根據地點。觀察形勢。可戰則戰。不可戰時則暗伏待機。乘日軍之疲而出擊之。亦可免巨大之犧牲。而留活動之餘地也。</p>
<p>吾觀近數年來兩次對外之戰。無不以絶援而致敗。中俄满洲里之戰。梁忠甲韓光第所部。非不能戰　。而孤軍應敵。不勝蘇俄大軍之壓迫。十九路軍上海之戰。盛名震中外。亦卒因乏援而退却。吾思及此。不禁爲東北義勇軍懼。而希望國人之起而促政府出兵援助。闡明形勢。並述其應有之條件。至其後兩端。亦因愛惜義勇軍而爲之借箸一籌非敢於興奮空氣中喪國人之氣也。</p>

<p>（北平）　據由瀋新到北平某軍事家談、關東軍司令部、力倡取熱河攻華北、因其政策與日本外交上有重大關係、如再攻取熱河及華北、已無所謂特殊權益、可以欺瞒世界、僅可露出其侵略本性、自認爲世界和平之公敵、所以日政府未能同意放任關東軍之侵略熱河及華北、關東因有此種困難、遂與僞國各愧儡要人磋商、擬定擾亂華北之計劃、聞其新定之計劃、爲利用在瀋陽之　河沿岸出身之紳商、專用金錢誘惑此輩好商、帶日本軍部之使命、派代表各回其故鄉、專事煽動鄉里無智識愚民、收買土匪、利用失意軍閥、從中操縱在　河各地、作亂犯法、倡言　河獨立、與僞國合併爲口號、肆意作亂及其内亂發動後、日逆聯軍、藉以保僑之名目、攻取山海關、與此輩土匪聯絡、先佔河北省東要地、然後利用此種之傀儡進攻平津、日軍掩護之日軍、慣用此種毒計、是否能成功、全視華北將領如何决心爲定、（六日華聯社電）</p>

<p>前晚下午九時許、民國路三四七號茂昌洋貨號炸彈爆發、被崗警拘獲十六歲靑年惲蕙芳、經二區一所徐所長訊問一過、並在身畔搜獲函件後、以情節重大、連夜申解總局、昨晨十時許、經第三科吳芷泉科長指派謝藻科員提訊、惲直供不諱、並因熱血衝動、大發抗日議論、謝科員以不涉本案範圍、故制止之、現悉惲蕙芳未满法定年齡、及因抗日運動、故各方頗有願爲具保、並請寛釋者、惟局方正在偵查期問、未有表示、</p>
<p>血魂除奸團愛國少年惲蕙芳、前晚在法租界民國路三四七號茂昌洋貨店抛擲炸彈、被公安局二區一分所警士捕獲後、徐所長鑒於案情重大、旋於當晚十一時解送總局、惟法捕房警務總監費白氏、因此案發生租界、爲求明瞭事實起見、昨晨特派中西探員、持文至公安局、要求迎提、並聲明少加詢問後、即行送還、溫局長當即允可、隨將惲交來探帶至捕房、捕頭將惲詳加訊問後、認惲完全係一未成年之幼童、表示原諒、並當面向惲勸誡一番、大約一二日内、仍須解還公安局云、</p>

<p>府許可、集合徒衆、置備武器、對於邦交尙未斷絶之一個外國有戰　行爲、似亦不合、但假使現在忽有一人倡此論調、斥東北義勇軍抵抗强暴侵略爲不合、我知全國人民、必嗤其人爲喪心病狂、何則、國家不能用武力對抗强暴侵略、乃由人民起而自救、法律祇能取一種放任行爲、不能再以刑法上之所謂妨害國交罪相繩也、國家不能用經濟封鎖之策略、以武力禁止與侵略者通商、乃由人民以武力裁制、此爲除好團組織之由來、該團行動、即有軼出法規之處、亦與義勇軍末奉令而私與外國戰　情形類似、國家現無以此項法條懲治義勇軍之情理、則國家於此種特殊環境之下、亦無執法以干涉愛國志士除奸之行爲、亦祇可將刑法三十七條之範圍擴大解釋、予以不罰面已、謹此宣言、</p>

<p>武裝保護日貨運往長江口岸傾銷辦法、</p>
<p>團體、與日海軍第三艦隊司令左近司、商擬就緒、惟左近司因本人不日即將出巡武漢、故將是事、全權交與陸戰隊司令杉坂辦理、自八月一日、日輸復航之日起、即開始武裝保護日貨、運往長江口岸傾銷、時聞社記者、昨特向日方探悉、種種消息、分錄於後、</p>
<p>▲武裝保護貨運　武裝保護貨運問題、自經第一艦隊司令左近司、將全權移交於陸戰隊司令杉坂辦理後、杉坂司令、當即於前日發表一告僑商書、詳述本人對於武裝保護貨運之堅决、同時即召集在滬各商業重要份子、集議實施辦法、當即擬定、（一）從本月四日起、由滬運往長江口岸一帶日貨、在貨輸尙未啓椗之前、先由第一外艦隊内、酌調軍艦四艘、開往蕪湖·九江·漢口·宜昌·等日貨起卸之目的地、等候貨輪開到、實施武裝倮護起卸、（二）於上海開出之運貨郵輪上、由新從東京調來之軍官狄原·橫尾·靑木一·稻村·覺松·尾强·杉木·大野·福本·岡島·等輪流隨輪武裝保護、並由陸戰隊本部、於每艘貨輪上、派駐武裝陸戰隊二十名、隨同協助、（三）貨物由國内裝運來滬者、在報關起卸之時、陸戰隊本部、得酌量情勢、以保護貨物之安全起卸、以上四項辦法、經日在滬各商業團體認爲满意後、即於日前開始實行、因之日淸輪船公司之長江丸、於前日駛往漢口時、仍裝有約計價値八十餘萬大批日貨、運往長江口岸起卸、計蕪湖六十箱、九江三十五箱、宜昌二十箱、武漢最多、約有百餘箱云云、</p>
<p>▲應付排日方針　日在滬各商業團體、自血魂除好團·鐡血鋤好團·等、相繼紛起活動後、莫不大起恐慌、近且全國各地、均已有該團等之組織、對於日貨傾銷政策上、殊有莫大影響、故曾連日在居留民團内、召開聯席會議、切實制止辦法、惟討論結果、除推代表向駐滬領事請願、要求向我市府當局、予以切實制止外、並無别種切實辦法、因日貨之運往各地傾銷、海軍當局、雖可負武裝保護之責、但各華商之肯否交易、則全在華商個人態度　海軍當局實無權能使其强爲承銷也、但時聞社記者、昨又據日方傳來確息、謂旅滬日商、已向軍政當局、作更進一步之要求、迅予切實制止上海各排日團體之活動、一面並將函請工部局、對於投彈恐嚇之血魂除奸團等、予以嚴密之取締、並科以擾亂治安之罪、惟此項辦法、日方能否實行及工部局能否予以接受、尙屬一問題、但日商方面、已將此項意見、提交軍政當局矣、</p>

<p>▲對原則均表示贊同</p>
<p>▲但注重新幣及紙幣</p>
<p>上海市商會以廢兩改元、關係重大、前曾將中央銀行副總裁陳行君函詢三點、即（一）新幣重量及成色、（二）兩元折合辦法、（三）如何使民衆瞭解、通函本市各業、徴求意見、除糖業等十餘公會、對三點有意見發表、已誌前報外、茲該會續接綢緞業等九公會答復、摘誌要點如下、</p>
<p>▲綢緞業　當此　價步跌、工商業暗受　耗之際、此項政策尤爲刻不容緩、無可　議之要圖、惟天下事往往利弊相乘、興利之先、亟宜除弊、蓋我國幣制之紊亂、其癥結在於價格行用之不統一、屬會意謂廢兩改元、原爲統一幣制、其於實施之際、須有切實凖備者三、（一）新幣鼓鑄成色、與制幣十進、以及全國所用、均須統一、（二）硬幣成色、不得減低於現行重量、鼓鑄時、尤須絶對公開化騐、（三）軟幣發行應有充實凖備、絶對何證、不得停兌、</p>
<p>▲國藥業　（一）各省造幣廠同時取銷、專歸中央幣廠鑄造、如是鑄幣權統一、新幣之重要量成色、不致參差（二）各普通銀行之紙幣發行權、宜同時一律取銷、專歸中央銀行一家發行、票上不印地名　到處可以匯兌及兌現、</p>
<p>▲西顔料業　（一）新幣重量成色、應仿照民三幣制條例、須召集各業團體、組織委員會實行監理、或定期化騐、豋報公告、（二）銀兩折合、關係全國債權債務、應責成各地商會、召集各業持平折衷規定或採取民十八·十九·二十·三年中之平均　價爲法價、（三）統一發行、特設專庫、準備金依照法定、至少須有現金六成、不得以他種欵項移抵、尤須由法定團體、隨時公開檢查、　　▲出租汽車業　（一）新幣須有適中價格、（二）折合比率公開訂定、（三）發行凖備嚴密檢查、　　▲冰鮮魚行業　該公會以政府如欲整頓幣制、應先從整理軟硬幣入手、其主張如下、（一）鼓鑄新銀幣、須將市上所通行舊幣、一律收回、</p>
<p>新幣須供求相應最緊要　、須詳全國人民有監視鑄造之權、（二）整理軟幣設立專局、有統一發行權準備必須合法、蜚非專局所發行者、一律取銷準備旣有法定、檢查亦易着手、（三）上列兩項、如能實行、則廢兩改元、迎刃而解、至兩元之如何折合、須責成各地商會、酌量情形、折衷規定</p>
<p>▲紗業　該公會無列舉意見、大體贊同錢業覆陳行君之函、及馬驥良君这書面意見並對於虞洽卿先生之通電、認爲係深於閱歷之談、致其深偑</p>
<p>▲紙業　（一）我國軟硬幣及輔幣之不統一、正如銀兩之龐雜、故廢兩改元、不從統一幣制着想、收效亦微、應由會同研究委員會召集各省之經濟專家工商領袖、集議其癥結之點、務使全部幣制、得以實現統一、（二）廢兩改元後、皆用銀元、所有從前之貼水升現去水等費、是否仍予存在、（三）國際易、向以銀兩折合、廢兩改元後、如何能使新幣爲國際貿易通貨制度之標準、（四）使用新幣舊幣、應逐漸收回、設使新幣重量、低於舊幣、難保無牟利之徒、私行鎔化、如是舊銀幣之價値、勢必超過新幣、雖政府不難收回、而鑄費與銀色之差額、必使國庫增加支出、目下已否有準備、（五）銀元並用時　凡提供凖備、大都以現銀（卽元寶銀）充足、廢兩改元後銀之價値、當然存在、此後提供凖備、是否仍用元寶銀、</p>
<p>▲人力車業　該公會祇注重於陳行君第二項原則、蓋以大小商店皆與銀錢業有相當往來之契約、若不先將洋　規定、糾紛不已、祇須將該項處理得宜、社會自無間言、至新幣之重量成色及法價、可仿照東西洋先進國遵有幣制條例、按實鼓鑄、尤須由各業團體實行監督化騐、不難一致、</p>
<p>▲顯湘君　（一）鼓鑄新幣、其重量及成色、應有一定之規定、並許民衆團體有監督之權、（二）銀兩折合銀元之比價、應廣徴有關係各方意見、而定一持平辦法、（三）統一發行、以謀金融之鞏固、而袪社會之疑慮、</p>

<p>（甲）關於性情者（一）遊覧名山大川、養成海闊天空的氣度、脫去編狹的鄉土觀念、或其他封建宗派的觀念、（二）閱讀大發明家和一切學者的傳記、和自傳、養成刻苦耐勞深心向學的習慣、（三）體察民間的痛苦、發揮改進社會的情緒、以排隊自私自利的慾求、</p>
<p>（乙）關於意志者（一）體認全民族被壓迫的痛苦、以堅定反帝國主義的决心、（二）閱讀世界上大革命家的傳記、養成効力社會自我犧牲的精神、Ｃ、鍛練體格方面、我國人向來被外人譏爲遠東病夫、又處於弱小民族的地位、遭受帝國主義的蹂躪、現在的情况、更是日趨險惡、我們便非鍛練體格、使有由自衛而進於自强的力量不可、（甲）關於遊藝者　如球隊的組織和比賽、拳術的練習、游泳和駕船的練習與競爭······等等、（乙）關於操勞者如軍事訓練的學習、遠足旅行、參加各種家庭的社會的勞動工作······等等、Ｄ、提倡文化方面　鄉村文化的低落、也是國家多亂的一個原因、學生們受社會的供養而來求學、在可能的範圍之内、應該爲社會効勞、假如我們一定要等到畢業後才接近社會、實是一個最大的錯誤、我們應該在平日就努力的接近社會、才能做一個社會上的學子、而不是字簏或字典的化身、</p>
<p>文化一詞、所包者廣、風俗、習慣、宗敎、文字、······都可以說是文化、我們的提倡、應分爲宣傳和實施兩項、二者之間、又有不可分開的聯系、（甲）關於宣傳者如國際情形和東北問題的講演、或個人談話、改良農作物和灌漑方法、防災設備驅除病虫害的建議、預防時疫的察惕、造林養鷄秧田養鯉等的提倡、識字運動的厲行、破除迷信和陋習、如早婚溺女、兩姓械鬥、細故涉訟等、注重公共衛生等等、</p>
<p>（乙）關於實施者　如體育會的組織、暑期補習學校巡　　　、流動圖書館、　　　、露天學校等的成立、臨時時疫醫院的設置、捕減　　、獎勵公共衛生的實行等等、</p>
<p>以上所提的大綱、不過是就一般所應行的大槪地說、學生中有小學生、也有大學生、能力和智識相差甚遠、因此每個人應該選擇他所能夠做的去做、先規定一個計劃出來、規定計劃時應注意的二點、（一）計劃中有些是須合就近的同學、或者是當地人民同做的、那一部份須要和大家去商量、或會議之後、再將在其中自已所担任的工作、加入個人所規定的計劃之中、（二）規劃中不僅要規定自已所應做的事、還要注意到時間上的分配、譬如用十分之四的時間於學術的研究、十分之二的時間於身心的修養、十分之二的時間於體格的鍛練、十分之二的時間於文化的提倡、（三）計劃應該通盤籌算、估量可能做到的限度、但事實是難預料的、在計劃的進行中、難免遭逢意外的阻力、所以計劃的限度、應該規定兩種出來、一種是最高的限度、一種是最低的限度、（四）計劃實施後、需有成績的報告、以證實計劃不是紙上的空談、（完）</p>

<p>中華兩單打由林寶華鄭兆佳代表、葡萄牙則由小塔佛斯卡那凡洛應戰、葡之戰鬥實力、遠不及前、兩組單打、均以直落三失敗、</p>

<p>林寶華（中）　六二　六二　六三　小塔佛斯（葡）</p>
<p>林寶華在上海綱球界中、尙可稱謂頂兒人物之一、彼小塔佛斯者、不過二三流之徒耳、其受林氏之控制、而奔跑於其意志之指揮下、固一件任人、知曉之事實耳、第一盤小塔氏於第二第五兩局、在莫名其中、奪歸已有、其餘所負諸局、亦竟於不知所謂内失去之、第二盤之情况、亦恍惚相似、總之、生死之權、操在林手而已、第三盤、小塔氏困　猶鬥、用盡全力、冀有所挽回、一時曾以三比三平手、此種成績、亦其當日一瞬時得意之秋也、渠供球急峻、爲其各種手法中之最佳者、此外惟見其燥急萬分、因是一舉一動、每使觀者爲之忍俊不已也、林氏逢此對手、無往而不露其從容之態度、生平絶技、遂藏而不顯、意者不忍出此耳、結果林氏以六比二、六比二、六比三勝之、</p>

<p>鄭兆佳（中）六三　八六　六一　卡那凡洛（葡）</p>
<p>目爲林寶華第二而顯見無限量　前途之鄭兆佳、昨以中華選手名義、出與葆萄牙老將卡那凡洛周旋、三通鼓下、四壁掌起、老將軍曳甲而逃、少英雄得勝回朝、鄭氏在其本身戰史中、不少偉大紀錄、挫特克、敗惠特、而又一度克德孚於廬山、今且以勝卡那凡洛聞矣、鄭兆佳之過去如此、可以執諸新進好手之牛耳而無愧、其餘未來、甚望其早日成爲遠東名將之一、想鄭氏早熟思而籌之矣、卡那凡洛敗固敗焉、然在塲作壁上觀者、除第三盤見其略現疲弱外、仍得保持其大將丰態、結果鄭氏以六比三·八比六·六比一直落三勝卡氏、</p>
<p>▲後來居上　第一盤卡氏開球、穏愼有餘、勝第一局、鄭氏於第二局内　有可勝性、而仍失敗、咎在燥急、第三局鄭氏不失一球而全勝、第四局鄭氏累見自殺、終告失敗、成一比三、占上風、觀者心寒、不料從此激起少年英氣、竟得後來居上、第五局開塲見阨、處置有方、乃轉危爲安、奪爲已有、第六局之勝賴其供球之力、第七第八第九三局、鄭氏確有超人之工作、旣能應付、又善攻擊、於是一一而歸其囊中、結果六比三勝、</p>
<p>▲掙扎甚力　第二盤鄭氏開球　卡氏精神散漫　連失四下第一局又爲鄭氏所有、第二局鄭氏失其均勢、每觸綱自殺、是局乃歸卡氏、（一比一第三·第四·兩局　各勝一局、平分秋色、第五第六兩局最有精彩、雙方勢均力敵、難分高下、結果、卡氏得第五局、鄭氏得第六局、三三平手之後、卡氏東西掃擊無往不利　幾番供球、尤峻急無比、難以抵擋、於是鄭氏乃受其支配連負第七第八兩局造成三比五之惡劣形勢第九局乃生死所繫、卡氏大有一呑而下之勢、不久卽占三比一上風、彼時鄭氏沉著應戰、攻守之間全力注視、死裏逃生反敗爲勝　成四比五第十局鄭氏連告凱旋、成五比五、平地忽起波浪、卡卡氏又勝第十一局、自第十二局至第十四局、鄭氏一身抱懷、莫不盡量表露、卡氏幾莫知所趨、一任其宰割而已、結果鄭氏又以八比六占勝、、</p>

<p>近時曾有人主張（槍口對外），這又是違背我禮義之邦的尊嚴了，所以當道自始至終是高舉着香檳酒杯敬獻給我親愛的支邦，</p>
<p>山水秀麗，中國是得天獨厚，所以即如勇毅的將軍們，亦具有淡恬的性情，鑑賞藝術的態度，來到泰山，五台山，廬山，牯嶺，峨嵋山，西湖，率戴河，······不是避暑或託病，便是唸佛或會議，而一向住居嚴寒地帶的一位風流將軍</p>

<p>黨派的活躍，參加的衆多，確表示國人（共赴國難）的熱誠，</p>

<p>那麽，找事做罷··哼！一個中學生，配做甚麽呢？中學校的當局，始終也不想倒中學生自已尋飯碗的問題，它就老實不將關於社會服務的智識灌輸在中學生的腦子中，結果，只造成了一大批只會消耗不會生産的高級游民，我當然不免是其中的一個，根本就無事可作·</p>
<p>以上是我本身所感到的痛苦，希望今後一般辦大學與辦中學的敎育家，能從事改革，免得一大羣中學生，在出路上徬徨失措·</p>
<h3 id="c206">琥珀瑣談 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 秦·伯·未·</p>
<p>讀本刋九三老人（走方郎中的奇蹟）</p>
<p>一文。舉我所知。錄供商榷。老人全文可分三點。一琥珀的眞僞。二琥珀的産生。三琥珀何以能治心病。</p>
<p>今按琥珀屬鑛物。品類極多。雷斅謂紅如血色。以市拭熱。吸得芥子者爲眞。日本進口之琥珀。皆透明作深紅色。國人稱爲血珀。亦名金珀。此爲上品。其色稍淡者。名銀珀。次之。淡黄者名蠟珀。又次之。帶黑者爲下品·（老人謂國中所見。大都墨晶色。即屬此種。）見日用藥品考。所</p>
<p>以名琥珀者。李時珍謂。（虎死則精魄入地化爲石。此物狀似之。　故謂之虎魄。俗文從玉。以其類玉也。）姑仍其說。</p>
<p>其産生、。由於松柏科植物之樹脂。埋没地中。經久而化爲石。故常在地下第三第四兩地層。散布於砂·粘土·石灰質等之小石塊間。其得自海濱者。當仍自地層來也。多産於東洋之海岸各地。及俄·德·波蘭·瑞典。丹麥等國之紗中。或海水中。漢書西域傳所載。琥珀從外國來。父老相傳。琥珀松香變成。實非無據之談。蓋實爲變石之樹膠。而非木脂之一種。或有專指爲松楓之脂。不知木脂入地。千年皆化。但不及松楓南脂而多經年歲耳。</p>
<p>琥珀能治心病。散見醫籍。並非走方郎中獨得之秘。但所謂心病者。以心痛·神不安·癲癎·諸症爲限。所以然者。其成分爲樹脂·揮發油·琥珀酸·斯可企湼·及硫黄等。所含竄透揮發之油鹽。有開達腦神經之效也。外用治局部麻痺及慢性關節風濕痛。俱極著效。惟走方郎中用以外治心悸。無從引徴耳。</p>
<p>又琥珀油爲殺鼠藥。最有功效。其有效成分。即在琥珀酸。法以琥珀酸合牛膽。并鼠喜食之蕎麥粉。和成丸子。鼠食之。立即遍身毛戴。煩渴欲死。得水則飲。愈飲愈渴。漸漸動作遲鈍。自食後三時半至二十七時内。無不倒斃。見東京獸醫新報。爲吾國醫籍所未見者也。（却酬）</p>

<p>（三）（十）脚花紡織工廠</p>
<p>棉紡織。爲我國大工業之一。惟紡餘脚花。鮮知利用。致以賤價售於外人。製造毯布藥棉玩具等品。　再輸入國内。一轉運間坐獲巨利。漏巵之大。可想而知。年來崛起利用脚花。經營廢紡事業者。首爲滬上民生紗廠。繼則通成紡織公司。嗣後如經緯勤豐申新等六七廠繼焉。尤以通成紡織公司設備最完備。紡織漂染俱全。查該廠設在京滬綫常州戚墅堰。佔地一百六十餘畝。南臨運河。北枕鐡道。廠内工務方面。計分製棉部。漂染部。紡紗部。織物部。機器均購自德國各名廠。排列整齊。設備周全。出品有四支六支粗紗。灰色軍用毯。花素絨布·絨毽·襪子·圍巾·以及藥棉紗布等。内中絨毯絨布。花色鮮艶。質地堅實。灰色軍用毯一項。年出數十萬條。質地尤佳。該廠出品。年來非常暢銷。因比較洋貨。價廉物美故也。至該廠管理主面。頗能迎合時代潮流。待遇職工。非常優厚。有合作社·診所·小學校·花園·浴室等設備。廠内外空曠異常。樹木森森。雖盛夏不覺炎熱。容納工人至千餘人之多。雖無工會組織。而勞資之間。怡怡如也。</p>

<p>— 不除庭草齋天</p>
<p>七十四</p>
<p>我問：（工學團要想辦成功該有幾個條件？）朱先生說·（一要有創辦的决心；二要有工作的技術；三要有可用的原料；四要有勞動力；五要有資本。）</p>
<p>我問··（在傳統的學校裏創辦工業團；創辦的决心在於態度的轉變；工作的技術可以虛心學來；可用的原料當然是就地取材；勞動力是現成的，肯得用出來也在念頭之一轉；惟獨那資本，當這民窮財盡之秋，是如何的得來？）</p>
<p>朱先生說：（也就現成的！只要念頭一轉，那偉大的資本便近在眼前不必求人。你到敎育部去把最近出版的敎育統計槪况找來，我們便可以算出究竟有多少資本可以供我們運用。）</p>
<p>七十五</p>
<p>我們在敎育部和别方面的統計裏得到了一些驚人的事實。從民國七年八月至一八年七月··全國公私立大學專門學校，以已經立案的爲限，有學校八六所，敎職員六九八五人，學生五三四一○人，支出經費是三千六百七十九萬元；全國公私立中等學校，未立案的都算在内，有學校一三三九所，敎職員三○三四八　人，學生二三四八一一人，支出經費二千四百六十萬元。大學生個人用費每年每人約三百元總起來便是一千六百零二萬元。中學生個人用費每年每人約一百五十元，總起來，便是三千五百二十二萬元。將個人費用加上辦學費用，大學專門學校八六所一年消費國力是五千二百八十二萬元，中等學校一三三九所，一年消費國力五千九百八十二萬元。中學以上學校一年的總消費是一萬一千二百六十四萬元。這種消費是年年開支出，繼續消費他十年便是十　萬二千六百四十萬元化爲鳥有。我們辦　些不事生産的學校簡直是敎人坐吃山空。假使大家轉個念頭，學校變成工學團，這一年一萬一千二百六十四萬元的消耗便一躍而變成生産的資本，三萬七千敎師和二十八萬七千學生都從高等遊民一躍而變爲生産的工人。八十六所大學，每所有六十萬資本，便是一個中等工廠。一千三百三十九所中學，每所有資本四萬六千，是個小工廠。資本旣是用作生産，一年年的滖上去，到了十年，每個中等工廠是擁有六百萬的資本而變爲大工廠了，每個小工廠是擁有四十六萬的資本而變爲中等工廠了。這樣自能把一個窮的中國變成一個富的中國。若是念頭不轉，必至人財兩空，一起鳴呼哀哉？中華民族？這念頭要快快的轉呀！</p>

<h3 id="c209">情的發生原因和情的眞義 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 林霞</p>
<p>連日本刋對於守節·再醮·婚嫁·自殺·性慾·······諸問題，已發表了不少的佳作，我覺得這些問題内，包含着一個根本大問題，便是（情）字。</p>
<p>古人論情，專就表面上的意義和性質·加以　揚，什麽情痴·情種·眞情·假情·熱情·冷情·至性之情·純潔之情·······眞是舉不勝舉，究竟情的發生原因和情的眞義，不曾道著半句。</p>
<p>人是動物中最富於感情的，所以要研究情字，專就人類活動，尋不出牠的眞義的，最好用生物學的眼光，去考察動物界的現象，便明白了。</p>
<p>動物界中感情的發生，是漸漸進化的，最下等的談不上什麽感情，體旣簡單，各自生活，裂體而生，無分雌雄，稍高等的僅僅在主殖期間，兩體暫時接合（不是配合）片刻而離，仍各自生自滅，　兩體之間，有無感情，殊難揣測。</p>
<p>再高等些的動物，小如昆蟲·魚蛙·大如飛鳥·走獸·大多數也只在生殖時期，雌雄互相配合，比時，兩體之間，爲求種族上的繁衍，便自然而然的現出種種歡悅的（情愫）出來了，猛如虎豹毒如蛇蠍，到了此刻也變柔和了，但是一度之後，東西分散，情的根源，終屬淡薄，只有蜘蛛寡情，最爲冷酷，交配後雄者常有被雌者殺食之禍，可算動物界中一個奇特例外。</p>
<p>更高等的少數飛鳥，如雀·如燕·少數走獸，如猿·如猴·性交之後，雌雄仍舊同居，幼子産出，共同撫養，於是相親相愛之情，越加濃厚，情愛時間，也加久長了，然而鶵鳥生翼，各自飛去，小犢有足，不告而奔，一對老夫妻，因爲生育之責，已告完結，也唱着驪歌，不經法官判决，便自行宣告離婚了，到了來年，再各尋戀人，再賦同居，年年循環，大自然生生不已的法則，頼以重演，只有最高的猩猩和人類，交配之後，雌雄永久同居，情最濃厚，亦最久長，人類社會，更制出婚嫁禮節，以妨淫亂，定出法律，以止變異。</p>
<p>統觀全動物界，我可以下個結論，（一）（情）是隨着動物的進化，漸漸發生的，動物愈高等情愈濃厚，亦愈久長，爲什麽要有（情），最初就爲得是要維持種族，産生幼子，所以原始的（情），完全是雌雄結合的（情）。</p>
<p>（二）（情）的發生，旣然建築在雌雄結合上面，可知（情）的效用，便在使雌雄歡喜結合，甘心願意，爲種族而犧牲精力，撫育幼子，這才是（情）的眞義。</p>
<p>動物進化到雌雄永久同居的地步，於是親子之間，發生了慈愛和孝順的（情）兄弟姊妹之間，發生了友愛之（情），更進而親戚之問，朋友之間，也發生和睦同敬愛之（情）了，這些情的效力，便在增加人生的趣味，促進社會的安寗和進步。</p>
<p>靑年的男女朋友們，（情）字實含有義務的根苗，若爲要求精神上的安慰，身心的保護，才講戀愛，未免太自私自利了，你如果覺得願意去盡種族繁衍的責任，不妨抱獨身主義，做些其他貢獻社會的工作，你如果不肯放棄傳種的天職，只要選到身心康健，情投意洽的對方，便可結婚，際斯危難時局　不應，過亽奢華，旣經結婚，便當各盡義務，自有生活佳趣，切不可學下等的鳥獸隨隨便便脫離關係，若是因失戀而自殺，更顯出你的無意識，錯認了人生全部了，不幸夫婦中夭，留下弱子孤女，寡婦情願守節，犧牲人幸福，完成她未了的撫育重責，對前夫思情，不忍斯絶，正是可敬可崇，不當强奪她志，若是無子無女，且難圖生，不願放棄她可以再負傳種的義務，再醮他人，正合自然大道，安可算作失節，至於貪圖肉體的快樂，做出鄙污的行爲，只可當作鳥獸看待，那夠得上是（人）談的上是（情），</p>

<p>— 中瑞</p>
<p>免疫Immunization的意義·是在當人體内有異質蛋白（註一）發生時，使身體能適應自已。意即抵抗病源菌Ｐathogenic　Micro　orgaisms之侵害力之謂。　　免疫分兩類，（一）被動免疫（二）自動免疫</p>
<p>（一）被動免疫　此類免疫法在施病者以抗毒（Anti　toxin）或殺菌(Anti　Bacterial)血淸，此種血淸注入人體後不能使患者自身發生任何抗毒作用，但供病者以特殊之抵抗素而已。此種抵抗素大都取之於他種動物之身，如馬，牛等。少量之病菌爲吾人注入馬體，此種病菌之抵抗素即存在於馬之血中，我人設法取得此抵抗素而善藏之，不使壞滅，即以用之於人類或其他動物染疫之時·</p>
<p>被動免疫施於急性染疫之時，扶助</p>
<p>患者體内組織機能之運用，破壞菌體，解免及中和病菌所生之毒素。被動免疫質之有効期間甚短，自注入體内後三星期内即完全消失其免疫性</p>
<p>（二）自動免疫　自動免疫質之産生，在於當人體中組織及細胞與疫（Infection)相作用，不得不産生一種特殊之抵抗素以克服之。故自動免疫質皆人體細胞與疫直接爭鬥之産物，此種物質旣産生之後即常存在於人之血管及淋巴内，遇有病源菌侵入體内時即消滅之，不使人體受若何影響</p>
<h3 id="c212">自動免疫之兩種誘導法 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>一、人工接種法Inoculation此法施於康健人之身在以可加精密處理而爲害不烈之　菌接種人身使對人體作溫緩之侵襲，借免流行傳染病之重擊。如牛痘未發明前所用之（人痘）即是一例。</p>
<p>二、苗毒法此法Vaccination爲注射一種抗體原Antigen即是以之激剌身體組織，使發生抵抗素。供苗毒法用之</p>
<p>抗體原可用衡釋或限止之生活膿菌，如天花毒苗是·亦可用死菌及其所生毒素，如猩紅熱毒血淸是。</p>
<p>至於患愈之流行病人大致以後不再發該病，因患者體内，經天然之病菌爭鬥後，存有多量之抵抗素也。</p>
<p>（註一）異質蛋白，與人體内原有之蛋白不同，於人體有毒，大多爲由外侵入之有機體。</p>

<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>▲提倡聯合營業</p>
<p>過去國貨工廠之失敗，雖原因不一，以見妒於同業，卒至同歸於盡者，十可七八。</p>
<p>某業有利可圖也，一人創之，百人繼之，以中國疆域之大，如百人百地而製，原無問題，即不然，你西我東，銷售地點，百人百路，亦未嘗不可，乃偏喜薈集於一隅，競爭於一隅，於是互妒！競賣！减價！改科！偷工！出品惡劣，無人顧問，至同歸於盡而後已，外人每磯我國人，習於同類相殘，據此似益證實。</p>
<p>我國爲生産落後之國，比年國中工業品之生産額與消費額，成二與五之比，顧社會物質上之增進，又一日千里，全國人民對於工業品需要之殷，當可想見，各國且視我國爲商品傾銷塲，我以國貨而給國人採用，如果價廉物美，只感求過於供，母慮供過於求，偌大中原，銷路正多，更何必競爭於一隅，必使同歸於盡而後快。</p>
<p>鷸蚌相爭漁翁得利，坐視盈萬累億金錢，渡大西洋太平洋而去，鳴呼，人以貨品來，我以金錢去，人以金錢來，我以國權去，誰實爲之，孰令致之，此我國工商業過去之厄運，亦即我中華民國前途，莫大之厄運也。</p>
<p>實則我國今日之製造業，是纔在競製時期，尙未至競賣時期，不事工堅料實，精益求精之製，以垂久遠，而即欲以自是而非之品，求暢銷一時，其所以然者，不外下列二種心理。</p>
<p>（一）資本短少，急於圖利。　　（二）心存投機，見異即遷。　　有此上列兩種工業家，中國製造之命運，可以知矣，故欲維持我國現在之工廠，非提倡聯合營業不可，欲冀抵制外貨，振興國貨，更非先事提倡聯合營業不可，聯合營業之先决問題有二。</p>
<p>（甲）限制生産額。</p>
<p>（乙）估定標準價。</p>
<p>先統計該業全年貨品銷售額，以銷售總數，分配同業各廠分製之，再歸定逐年遞增産額若干，爲預備逐年增進銷路之需，過賸不足，有違原理，皆當處罰，惟分配産額辦法，極感困難，稍欠公允，怨尤立起，姑代擬辦法如下。</p>
<p>（一）以資本額之大小，定生産額之多少。</p>
<p>（二）以各廠最近三年内之平均銷額，　　爲日後該廠産額之標準。</p>
<p>各廠人才不同，社會需要亦不一，如定欲以資本爲生産標準，勢難公平，况有歷年經過及盈虧關係，資本之是否得維持當初數額，另有問題，是皆足使上項第一辦法，發生困難點也，至以一二年平均銷數，爲日後産額標準，此係根據事實，是較爲公道者也，此外估定貨品之標準價格，自當先行敦請業中領袖，及該業專家，征集該業各色貨品，公開展覽，估定價格，視貨品之高下，定價目之大小，設日後價目之應否增减，是以視原料工資等情形外，再視其銷數之多寡，以定某貨價目之應增應减，亦至公道者也，聯合營業之利有五。</p>
<p>（一）得實施通盤計劃。　　（二）得集中人才，分頭推銷。　　（三）得專心製造。　　（四）得整個對付客户。　　（五）得免無爲競爭，致兩敗俱傷。</p>
<p>一言弊之，曰獨力難支，衆擎易舉此不獨聯合營業一事已也，營業聯合之後，第一當再從事分工製造，設某業有貨品十餘色，今不必一廠製造齊全矣，以某廠平日長於製造某色者，即責任其專製某品，夫業精於一，一則專，專則熟，熟則速，速則多，出品旣多，成本隨之减低矣，惟除責任其製造所長某色貨品外，同時必須責任其兼製地色一二種，所以掉濟其銷路暢滯也，蓋各廠出品各異，而社會需要，竟有時相同，於是有甲貨暢銷，乙貨滯遲，勢必甲廠獲利，乙廠虧本，以利始而害終，是大違聯合初旨矣，今兼製他種，未必能數種貨品，同時暢銷，和同時遲滯也，總之聯合營業之後，同業各廠，有福同享，有難同當，共存共榮，同進同退，庶幾不枉費此一番團結力也，至進一步，謀原料合作，消耗合作，均屬可能範圍内事，惟不涉本題，爰當另述之。</p>
<p>聯合營業之利，已如上述，顧亦有弊存焉，各廠競爭已久，一旦言歸於好，化干戈爲玉帛，有如戰後歸卒，心惟苟安，以爲外無强敵，儘可優游歲月，以享餘年耳，出品等等，一任其舊，致毫無改進，同時對於本業，有認爲如世襲一般，壟斷一方，又以缺乏同業競爭，故對於顧客，慢不爲禮，以爲若必需用，有舍我其誰之慨，惟此皆個人敎育關係，不能說聯合營業之害也，雖作者過慮之言，然亦意中事，深望此言之不中也。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Recent Situation of the Volunteer Army's General Offensive ·梓· <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since August 1st, the general offensive launched by our Northeast Volunteer Army against the Japanese troops along the South Manchuria Railway has been as inspiring as the January 28th Incident and the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War fought by the 19th Route Army half a year ago. As we excitedly observe the war situation, we realize that while the Volunteer Army's current strength and frequent victories are gratifying, achieving a true victory in the future requires certain conditions. Patriotic citizens should take note of these even amidst their excitement.</p>
<p>During the Volunteer Army's general offensive, the front line stretches from Changchun in the north to Kaiyuan in the south, with a presence in Tongliao in the west for support. The recent focus of battles has been in the Liaoyang, Anshan, Haicheng, Dashiqiao, Kaiyuan, and Yingkou area. This is where the decisive battles of the Sino-Japanese Liaodong War took place thirty-seven years ago. Liaoyang serves as the southern shield of Shenyang, with Mount Motian to its east, a crucial strategic point in Liaodong. Haicheng marks the end of the eastern mountain range in Liaodong, and Kaiyuan marks the end of the southern mountain range. Dashiqiao serves as the passage between Haicheng and Kaiyuan. The continuous mountains in the southeast are advantageous for the Volunteer Army's operations. Utilizing these mountains, the Volunteer Army has launched multi-pronged attacks, leaving the Japanese troops overwhelmed and disoriented. The Japanese residents, who previously considered the South Manchuria Railway's affiliated areas as a peaceful haven, can no longer live in peace. The Japanese soldiers and police, who previously believed the South Manchuria Railway's territories were inviolable, are now greatly alarmed. However, this is only a temporary situation. Hounjo Shigeru has requested two divisions of reinforcements from Tokyo, and the Japanese government has approved the request via telegram. Thirty-seven years ago, the Japanese army first occupied Haicheng and engaged in battles with our Song Qing and Wu Dachun in this area for three months. They should have a reasonable understanding of the terrain. We predict that when these two divisions of Japanese troops arrive, the Volunteer Army's operations will face significant difficulties. This is the most concerning aspect of the future of the war.</p>
<p>The most important condition at present is, of course, the response of troops from Shanhaiguan and Rehe. However, based on the situation, we believe there is no possibility of this happening. Secondly, if the Volunteer Army is to fight independently, a necessary condition is to seize locations where they can converge before the arrival of the main Japanese forces. After converging, they should concentrate their forces under a unified command and engage the Japanese army in a balanced war. Meanwhile, the remaining troops should remain in their original bases and use guerrilla tactics to harass the Japanese rear. In this way, although the outcome remains uncertain, a long-term strategy may be possible. Further, the Volunteer Army should prepare early, accumulate supplies, consolidate their bases, observe the situation, and fight when possible. When fighting is not possible, they should lie in wait and strike when the Japanese troops are exhausted. This can avoid significant sacrifices and leave room for maneuver.</p>
<p>Looking at the two foreign wars in recent years, both resulted in defeat due to a lack of support. In the Sino-Russian Manchuria War, the troops led by Liang Zhongjia and Han Guangdi were not incapable of fighting, but as isolated forces, they could not withstand the pressure of the larger Soviet Russian army. In the Shanghai War fought by the 19th Route Army, despite their renowned reputation, they were eventually forced to retreat due to a lack of reinforcements. Thinking of this, I cannot help but fear for the Northeast Volunteer Army and hope that the people of the country will rise up and urge the government to send troops to provide assistance, explain the situation, and outline the necessary conditions. The latter two points are also made out of concern for the Volunteer Army. I dare not dampen the spirit of the people amidst the excited atmosphere.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Kwantung Army Plans to Disrupt North China <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Volunteer Army Attacks Yingkou, Nantai, and Heishan</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities Determined to Use Effective Methods to Rescue Ishimoto</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a military expert who arrived in Beiping from Shenyang, the Kwantung Army headquarters strongly advocates seizing Rehe and attacking North China. Because this policy has significant implications for Japanese diplomacy, further seizure of Rehe and North China would eliminate any pretense of "special rights" and expose their aggressive nature to the world, branding them as enemies of world peace. Therefore, the Japanese government has not agreed to allow the Kwantung Army to invade Rehe and North China. Faced with this difficulty, the Kwantung Army has consulted with various puppet figures in the puppet state and formulated a plan to disrupt North China. It is reported that the newly devised plan involves utilizing gentry and merchants from the banks of the Luan River in Shenyang, using money to lure these people, who would then carry missions from the Japanese military to their hometowns. Their mission would be to incite ignorant and uneducated civilians, recruit bandits, and exploit disgruntled warlords to create chaos and commit crimes in the Luan River region. Their slogan would be "Luan River independence" and "merger with the puppet state," allowing them to wreak havoc at will. Once the internal chaos erupts, the Japanese-puppet coalition forces would use the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese to seize Shanhaiguan and link up with these bandits. They would first occupy key areas in eastern Hebei Province and then use these puppets to attack Beiping and Tianjin, with the Japanese army providing cover. The Japanese army frequently uses such insidious tactics. Whether this plan will succeed depends entirely on the determination of the generals in North China. (Hua Lian News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) People in Beiping are deeply discussing the remarks made by the Tokyo Army Ministry regarding Zhang Xueliang. The first impression is that these remarks are a prelude to action by the Japanese in this region. Chinese officials remain silent, but today, most people believe that the Japanese army is preparing to take drastic action. However, according to the opinions of several well-informed foreigners, the sorghum fields are now vast, providing excellent cover for Chinese troops to ambush. Therefore, the Japanese army may not take any action at this time. This morning, Chinese newspapers urged the government to reject Tokyo's threats and immediately provide assistance to the Volunteer Army in the three northeastern provinces, otherwise the Volunteer Army will eventually be destroyed by the Japanese army. Foreigners believe that there is currently no indication that the Japanese army is about to invade this area. However, the Japanese continue their propaganda, preparing the ground for invasion, as they did before in Jinzhou and Shanghai. The general consensus is that the Japanese will inevitably take this action, but it has not yet been implemented. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Rumors of General Muto Ordering an Advance <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that Muto Nobuyoshi has set August 8th as the date for Japanese troops to advance towards Pingyu and the Jinzhao line. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Embassy is silent on the issue of possible actions by the Japanese army in this region. However, many Japanese say that such actions are unlikely. It is said that the embassy guard force is currently less than two hundred men, and there have been no reinforcements in this area or near Jinzhou. As for the reports that Japanese military authorities brought carrier pigeons, causing panic among the people and suggesting preparations for war, the Japanese claim that this is merely a part of normal military operations and nothing to worry about. Furthermore, rumors that the Japanese Embassy has made special arrangements to allow Japanese residents to seek refuge in the embassy with very short notice are seen as signs of paranoia by Chinese and foreigners alike.

<h3 id="e4">Increased Vigilance by Japanese Troops in Tianjin <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) After the capture of Liu Xuegu, the leader of the plainclothes unit, on the 5th, the people were greatly relieved. However, the Japanese military has increased its vigilance, preparing 10,000 burlap sacks and a large quantity of electric wire, stored in empty warehouses on Dadao Island.

<h3 id="e5">Japanese Military Authorities Rescuing Ishimoto <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Jinzhou, the Japanese military authorities, due to Ishimoto's continued detention, are now considering effective plans to force the Chinese authorities to release him. The reasons for this decision are: (1) Zhang Xueliang ordered Tang Yulin not to hand Ishimoto over to Japanese officials; (2) Zhang Xueliang and Tang Yulin fear that after Ishimoto is released, he will expose certain secrets that are detrimental to both of them.

<p>(Shenyang) The Volunteer Army stationed at Liu'erbao, about fourteen or fifteen li northwest of Anshan, has attacked Anshan several times. Their total strength is now over ten thousand men. This morning, they attacked Anshan again in formation. Between Anshan and Liu'erbao, they engaged in a battle with Japanese puppet troops. The Japanese army dispatched a garrison from Anshan, cooperating with the puppet army in the battle. The fighting has been fierce for four or five hours. The Japanese puppet troops are still retreating. The Volunteer Army is pursuing their victory, killing over a hundred men, including the company commander, and injuring countless others. However, the two sides are still engaged in battle. (Hua Lian News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>Yingkou: After Japanese reconnaissance planes discovered Volunteer Army groups retreating from Yingkou, Haicheng, Banzhuang, and Tianzhuang, they gathered at Shifosi.

<p>(Beiping) Hounjo, fearing that the active Volunteer Army posed a threat to Shenyang, has transferred Japanese troops from Changchun and the Duomen Division from Heilongjiang to Shenyang for joint defense. Shenyang has been placed under martial law starting at 6:00 PM. (Special Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>To Avoid Shaking Rural Thought</p>
<p>And Brewing a Domestic Social Revolution</p>
<p>▲China United News Agency Tokyo, 6th - The Japanese General Staff has ordered all gendarmerie teams nationwide to seriously suppress rumors. The reason is that since the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai, there have often been rumors about the military implementing fascist politics, military dictatorship, or that a Far East war is imminent, that the Japanese people will face great danger in the future, or that the Japanese financial world will go bankrupt, and that Japanese gold notes will become like the German mark after the European war. These rumors about political, military, and financial instability are increasingly shaking the minds of farmers who are filled with hunger, and there is a tendency for social revolution to occur everywhere. Therefore, this measure of suppressing rumors has been taken. In addition, the gendarmerie in various places have been ordered to cooperate with the police to strictly inspect various newspapers, magazines, publications, and promotional materials, and on the one hand, to direct veterans' associations in various places and military associations in the villages to help the police and gendarmerie suppress various remarks unfavorable to the government.</p>

According to Bank of Japan Governor Hijikata, there are many reasons for the unfavorable exchange rate this time, but the biggest reason is that the Manchurian Incident has not been resolved, especially the recent attacks by the Volunteer Army on various stations along the South Manchuria Railway, which has led to instability along the line and a pessimistic outlook on the future of the Manchurian Incident.</p>

It is expected that this move will greatly impact the market for Japanese goods in India. It is also reported that Argentina in South America is one of the largest markets for British goods, so the representatives at the conference never proposed any bills that would harm Argentina.</p>

<p>Firmly Demands an Outlet to the Sea</p>
<p>▲National News Agency Geneva, 5th - The Secretariat of the League of Nations has received replies today from the governments of Paraguay and Bolivia, both accepting the principle of resolving the Chaco dispute through arbitration or other peaceful means. Paraguay has accepted without conditions, while Bolivia has attached conditions, stipulating that all troops must remain in their current positions. Some of the Chaco region, which the two countries are disputing, has already been occupied by Bolivian troops. Neutral countries have now asked Bolivia for a ceasefire.</p>
<p>▲Reuters London, 5th - The Bolivian government issued a statement here saying that the final resolution of the Chaco region issue is closely related to Bolivia's current and future welfare. Bolivia's economy has gradually developed over the past fifty years, and its need to access the coast has become increasingly urgent. The theoretical outlet is the Paraguay River, which Bolivia should have. Sacrificing this right would be tantamount to abandoning the hope of future prosperity. The intervention of neutral countries implies economic sanctions against the belligerents, but Bolivia is landlocked on all sides, while Paraguay has a way out to sea, so economic sanctions would directly seal off Bolivia. The situation is no different from neutral countries forming an alliance with Paraguay. Therefore, external intervention, if not accompanied by concrete measures to finally and permanently resolve the Chaco issue, will be of no help.</p>

The Geneva disarmament talks, which lasted ten years, have yielded no substantial results, and the Ottawa Imperial Conference is nothing more than a staged drama.

However, according to the envoy, he has received reports that 24 overseas Chinese have been detained in Guaymas Port in Sonora State, and another 15 have disappeared in Hermosillo, the capital of the state, and have probably been forced into American territory. The envoy also said that the situation of overseas Chinese in Sonora State is unbearable. The reason why the envoy lodged the inquiry is that the Mexican authorities have been implementing a policy of expelling overseas Chinese, and in recent months, the number of overseas Chinese who have been deported is truly countless.</p>

<p>And Be Appointed Ambassador to France</p>
<p>▲Reuters Berlin, 5th - Rumors are circulating today that there will be a surprising change in German politics. This statement is said to have come from reliable sources, so it is believable. It is said that German Chancellor Papen will resign soon and become Ambassador to France. As for the current Ambassador to France, Hoesch, he will be transferred to London. Before the European War, Hoesch was the Secretary of the German Embassy in London. The aforementioned changes will depend on the situation at the end of the month when the parliament convenes. It is expected that there will be some changes in the cabinet when the new parliament convenes. If Papen does resign as Chancellor, it is widely speculated that his successor will be Defense Minister Schleicher or National Socialist Party leader Hitler. Papen is known for his sympathy towards France, and he had a good friendship with Herriot at the Lausanne Reparations Conference, so there would be no problem in sending him to France.</p>

Many prominent figures in Germany consult her on future events. Before the outbreak of the European War, in 1913, Mrs. Scherwier declared in front of many guests in the drawing room of Archduchess Erzsipe in Vienna that Archduke Ferdinand and his wife would be killed by (a single bullet) within two years, and that this would cause a bloody tragedy throughout Europe. Recently, Mrs. Scherwier predicted to various German newspapers that another world war is about to begin. It is said that the years 1932 and 1933 will be unforgettable years in history. Every country will be shaken. The Manchurian War will begin, and a tide will rise from the Far East, flooding all countries up to the mountain range. In Germany, two governments will appear, one elected domestically and the other forcibly established by foreigners. Germany's restoration will occur after joining hands with the United States and Russia. France, due to the death of a great man, will lose a lot of influence, and the major powers will gradually abandon it.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Recent Situation in the Northeast <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Tang Yulin's Property in Shenyang Sealed Again</p>
<p>American and Russian Capitalists Buying Land at Rock-Bottom Prices</p>
<p>A correspondent in Tianjin reports that a certain gentleman who recently investigated the situation in Liaoning Province arrived in Tianjin. He said that after the Japanese forcibly occupied the three northeastern provinces, they immediately coveted Rehe. However, because Rehe is mostly mountainous and not easy to attack, they considered avoiding a forceful struggle and instead adopted a pacification policy towards Tang Yulin. To seek peace, Tang also pretended to cooperate and sent a representative to Shenyang. As a result, Tang's property in Liaoning suffered no losses and was even protected by the Japanese army. Honjo Shigeru repeatedly pressured Tang to change his flag, but Tang refused, believing that the time was not yet ripe. On July 17th, Ishimoto Yushiro went missing. Japan used the power of its land and air forces to pressure the border of Rehe, hoping to intimidate Tang. Unexpectedly, Tang remained unmoved. Honjo was furious and ordered Tang's property to be sealed. Consequently, the grand building at No. 95, Sanjing Road, in the Shenyang commercial district was confiscated and will soon be put up for sale. Ishimoto has now been found, but Japan will not abandon its ambition to invade Rehe because of this. It is anticipated that they will implement their original plan in late autumn or early winter when the leaves have fallen completely (allowing for an unobstructed view from airplanes). Zhang Xueliang recently convened a meeting of northern Chinese generals in Beiping and issued a declaration of unity against foreign aggression, but the Japanese paid no attention. They said that the Rehe army is no different from a rabble, and the officers and soldiers have no combat experience. Although the Northeast Army has received training, the officers are arrogant and the soldiers are lazy, and they are all vulnerable to attack. Japan occupied the three northeastern provinces with 30,000 troops, and there is no reason why they cannot occupy Rehe. Although their words are exaggerated, our countrymen should be vigilant and strive to improve.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters' investigation, the total number of volunteers, self-defense forces, and national salvation armies outside the customs is 550,000. Although not entirely accurate, the figure is roughly correct. These many patriotic warriors have fought hard for months, yet they have not been able to drive back the 50,000 Japanese troops. There is a reason for this: (1) there is no leadership, and they have formed dozens of groups; (2) there is a lack of ammunition, and there is no replenishment or supply, so they can only attack when there is an advantage and retreat when there is no advantage. However, even with these two points, the Japanese army has found it difficult to cope, and trouble often arises from within. In the past three months, the pseudo-Fengshan Road, Datong Branch Road, and Sitao Road have been repeatedly damaged. The method of destruction is not to bomb bridges or dismantle rails, but to dig tunnels twenty or thirty feet away from the rails, using the concealment of sorghum stalks (i.e., green gauze barriers). This work is extremely fast and can be completed overnight. From the surface, there is no trace. When a military train passes by, it immediately collapses, and all aboard are annihilated. After suffering these lessons repeatedly, the Japanese completely铲 destroyed the sorghum within one li on both sides of the railway line and burned down the villages within five li. Now, when the sorghum is in the ear and bearing fruit, once it is destroyed, the people will lose their livelihoods for the whole year. In total, the losses are staggering. Based on 6,000 square feet per mu, a total of 1,296,000 mu of sorghum have been destroyed along the 1,200-plus li of the pseudo-Fengshan Road. In addition, 300-plus li of the Jinzhao Branch Road, 1,100-plus li of the Datong Road, and 1,000-plus li of the Sizhao Road account for another 2,592,000 mu. Valuing each mu of sorghum at six yuan, the total loss is over 23,328,000 yuan. How can the impoverished farmers bear this?</p>
<p>Those who were not successful under Zhang Xueliang are now holding puppet positions in the pseudo-state. Kan Zhaoxi is the superintendent of the pseudo-Central Bank. Zhang Xueliang had a huge deposit in the official bank of the three northeastern provinces, the exact amount of which no one knows, but it was all confiscated by the Japanese. Zhang Zuoxiang had a deposit of over 10 million yuan in the Jilin official bank, which was also confiscated. Recently, the pseudo-state issued pseudo-Feng banknotes stamped with the seal of the superintendent of the pseudo-Central Bank and forced the people near the railway lines to use them. The director of the pseudo-Liaoning Finance Department was formerly concurrently held by Wang Jiading, the director of the pseudo-Civil Affairs Department. Recently, Zhao Pengdi was appointed to take over. Zhao used to be a tax official in eastern provinces and was adept at extorting money. Zhang Zuoxiang was a large landowner in Jinzhou, but his land has now been confiscated by the Japanese and turned into farms for the Japanese garrison, which are being leased out through bidding. Zhang also had two pawnshops in Jin County, which were also sealed by the Japanese army, who are only holding onto goods until they are redeemed. Therefore, Zhang Zuoxiang has gone from being very wealthy to completely impoverished. Recently, American and Russian capitalists have organized real estate companies to invest in the Northeast and buy land and property at rock-bottom prices. Those who held official positions in the Northeast and owned property are rushing to mortgage or lease it permanently. Those belonging to the United States register with the American consul in Tianjin or the American consul in Liaoning, and those belonging to Russia register with the Russian consul in Harbin. These transactions are conducted secretly. If the Japanese find out, they will forcibly stop them. Therefore, there are quite a few disputes between American and Russian merchants and the Japanese.

<p>The Process of Re-designating Qiongya as a Special District</p>
<p>A correspondent from the China and Foreign News Agency in Guangzhou reports that Qiongya is an isolated island overseas, the southernmost gateway to our country, and urgently needs to be developed. The proposal to re-designate it as a special district was first put forward by Hu Hanmin, Tang Shaoyi, Sun Ke, and others, and then approved by the former Guangdong National Government and submitted to the central government for review and filing. The original proposal stated that Qiongya is relatively immune to military influence and can serve as a testing ground for the Three Principles of the People. Loyal comrades in the party should be selected and given full power for a period of twenty-five years to implement the Three Principles of the People. The intention is far-reaching. More than ten years ago, Wu Chaoshu aspired to develop Qiongya, and the late Premier Sun Yat-sen greatly appreciated his idea (it is said that Premier Sun's reply to Wu is still treasured today). Wu has a long history in the party and the country. When the old matter was brought up again, he was selected as the chief of the Qiongya Special District. After accepting the appointment, Wu was delayed by running around for the Ning-Yue peace talks and other matters. He only took the oath of office in Guangzhou on March 28th of this year and immediately issued a circular telegram, which was well received by public opinion. The main personnel of the special office's departments and bureaus were also appointed by the Southwest Political Committee one after another. The committee also promulgated an explicit order stating (Qiongya has a vast territory. In the past, it was divided into Dao for governance, but the governance was already crude and negligent. In the early years of the Republic of China, the official system was changed frequently. Although the Dao system was once restored, it was later abolished, and the thirteen counties of Qiongya were still directly under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government. The reach was too long, and development was even more difficult. The government weighed the pros and cons and explicitly ordered the re-designation as a special district. The area of the district should include the original thirteen counties of Qiongya and the Xisha Islands as its jurisdiction, ......). At the beginning, the authorities were very serious about this matter. However, although Wu sent a telegram to take office, he was slow to go to Qiong. The reason for this is that the re-designation of Qiongya as a special district was not welcomed by the gun-toting class and those in power in Guangdong. Only because the proposers were Hu, Tang, and Sun, and Wu had just returned from the United States, a certain powerful person wanted to win Wu over and use him. Therefore, they superficially welcomed Wu's appointment as provincial chairman and Qiong district chief. Later, because Wu was unwilling to be used and insisted on reducing military spending and separating the military and civilians, and was willing to sacrifice the provincial chairmanship, there was no reconciliation on political views, and he was greatly suspected. The demarcation of powers and the transfer of responsibilities with the provincial government had been ordered by the Political Committee, but the provincial government ignored it and continued to issue orders to the Qiong district as before. For example, Wu requested the Political Committee to allocate 500,000 yuan for the expenses of the re-designation, but not a penny was given. There were even Qiongya representatives who went to the Political Committee to petition for the cancellation of the special district as an expression of public opinion. Although Wu suffered many setbacks, his determination to develop Qiongya did not diminish. He had planned to set off for Qiong in early June to take office. Unexpectedly, the naval and air force change of allegiance suddenly occurred, and Wu's departure had to be postponed due to environmental and factual reasons. The naval storm has now ended, and all the marines have also left Qiong. In terms of the situation, Wu should be able to take office. However, things turned out to be unexpected. After the naval storm was resolved, Wu heard that the First Group had a plan to send troops to garrison Qiongya and immediately sent a letter to Chen Jitang expressing his welcome, stating that he would go to Qiong in the coming days and discussed the number of troops to be stationed, the amount of funding, and the duration of the garrison with Chen. Chen did not oppose this. However, the standing committee of the Political Committee suddenly put forward two proposals: one was that the provincial government should be temporarily responsible for the financial, civil, and construction affairs of the Qiong district, and the other was that a pacification director should be established in the Qiong district. Both proposals have been passed and promulgated, refusing Wu's departure for Qiong. On the other hand, there were representatives petitioning for the cancellation of the special district. The petition did not list any reasons why the re-designation was inappropriate, but only focused on attacking Wu indiscriminately. As for Chen Jitang's advocacy of Hu Hanmin, it has been going on for a long time. However, today, it seems that he respects him but is not close to him. Hu is in Hong Kong and is very leisurely. Before his death, Sun Zhe saw that the situation in the Southwest was deteriorating day by day, and Ma Chaojun was unable to reverse it. He personally came forward, originally wanting to find a way to unite and prevent the Southwest from becoming distorted. However, Chen still did not understand, and Sun had no room to maneuver. He could only let it change and has been staying in Hong Kong ever since. That is the reason.</p>
<h3 id="e87">The Issue of Receiving the Guangdong Warships After the Resolution of the Naval Incident <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Zhaoxin's Negotiations Completely Failed</p>
<p>Chen Jitang had long considered reorganizing the Guangdong navy. After much deliberation, Cai Tingkai obtained it without any effort, so he had to think of the next best thing: trying to get the Guangdong warships in Hong Kong back to the province as soon as possible. Hong Kong is British territory, where guns cannot be used and planes cannot bomb. Therefore, he ordered Zhu Zhaoxin to go to Hong Kong for negotiations. After receiving Chen's order, Zhu immediately went to Hong Kong and directly visited the Governor of Hong Kong. Earlier, about twenty large and small warships belonging to Chen Ce were stationed off Lingdingyang and the Qiongzhou estuary. After Ding Ji and Xu ordered the bombing, knowing that they could not stand firm, they fled to Hong Kong one after another. The Hong Kong government then presented Chen Ce with three options, asking him to choose one: (1) return them to Guangdong; (2) sail them out of Hong Kong; (3) they can stay in Hong Kong, but they must not participate in the war. Chen Ce thought that the third option was more beneficial, so he agreed to the Hong Kong government's proposal. Zhu Zhaoxin did not know this at the time. After meeting the Governor of Hong Kong, Zhu proposed to expel the Guangdong warships from Hong Kong and have the Guangdong government receive them. The Governor of Hong Kong's attitude was cold and asked Zhu, "Have you met with Chen Ce?" Zhu said no. The Governor of Hong Kong said, "Then please go and meet with Chen Ce first, and then come back and talk." Zhu left in disappointment. In recent days, it has been said in Guangdong that Zhu's negotiations have been successful and that the Guangdong warships will soon return to the team. This is not the case. The Guangdong warships, except for the Zhongshan, which went to Xiamen and then to Shanghai and was bombed and sunk, are all berthed in Hong Kong waters and have not returned to the provincial river. It is said that the Ministry of the Navy of the Central Government plans to find a way to accommodate the Guangdong warships and recruit them to return north.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Analysis of the Bandit Situation in Hubei Province <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Bandits Disturb Eight Out of Ten Counties in the Province</p>
<p>The Number of Bandits' Guns Totals Tens of Thousands</p>
<p>A correspondent in Hankou reports that almost all of the sixty-nine counties in Hubei Province have been ravaged by bandits. According to a recent survey, only fourteen counties are completely free of bandits: Wuchang, Huangmei, Puqi, Yunmeng, Hanchuan, Huanggang, Anlu, Guanghua, Nanzhang, Gucheng, Yichang, Baokang, Enshi, and Jianshi. Seventeen counties have a small number of scattered bandits that are being cleared within a limited time: Yingcheng, Jiayu, Shishou, Gong'an, Zhijiang, Songzi, Yidu, Yuan'an, Dangyang, Zigui, Xingshan, Badong, Changyang, Zaoyang, Xiangyang, Suixian, and Zhongxiang. Other counties are in a very precarious situation due to their proximity to neighboring areas or the inability of local militias to control the bandits, even though there has been some temporary progress: Qishui, Huangpi, Xiaogan, Yingshan, Chongyang, Xianning, Echeng, Tongcheng, Jiangling, and Jingmen. Six counties are occupied by various miscellaneous armies and cannot be effectively suppressed: Zhushan, Zhuxi, Fangxi, Yunyang, Junxian, and Fangxian. Fifteen counties cannot be effectively suppressed without the help of stationed troops: Guangji, Qichun, Luotian, Macheng, Huang'an, Tianmen, Mianyang, Jingshan, Qianjiang, Jianli, Tongshan, Yangxin, Daye, Wufeng, and Hefeng. The situation is as bad as in Jiangxi Province. The power and activities of the Red Bandits are investigated separately according to the areas designated for suppressing bandits, as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Eastern Hubei Formerly, Huangmei, Guangji, and Qishui counties were completely free of bandits. Qichun and Luotian counties, bordering Anhui and Henan, were only harassed by scattered bandits. Since May 29th, when the pseudo-Fourth Army, claiming to be two divisions, sneaked from Yingshan and captured Luotian County, the situation has gradually become serious. After occupying the city for one day, the bandits retreated to the Caijiahe and Ximaban areas in Qishui. On June 11th, they snuck into Guangji County, causing significant local losses. On the 14th, the Shangguan Yunxiang division of the 47th Army arrived in Wuxue and advanced on the bandits, who then withdrew from the county seat. They now occupy the Liugonghe and Zhangjiajing areas in Qichun County, digging trenches, building fortresses, and setting up telephones to resist stubbornly. On the 24th, another group recaptured Luotian County but was driven back again. They are now entrenched in the border area between Luo, Qi, and Ying. Most of Huang'an County has been captured by bandits and has become bandit-controlled for half a year. Only the area within twenty li near Baliwan has not been invaded by bandits. In the northwest corner of Huanggang, bandits from Pi'an occasionally sneak in, but it has recently been quiet. Not long ago, tens of thousands of bandits besieged Macheng, but the siege has been lifted by the Peng Zhensan division of the 30th Army. Huangpi and Xiaogan counties are adjacent to the Ping-Han Railway and are in constant danger. The stationed troops are now suppressing the bandits and have recovered dozens of li of lost territory. Along the Huangpi to Changxuanling and Xiaogan to Dongxiyanggang and Zhoujiaxiang lines, the people have mostly voluntarily handled the clearing and rehabilitation work. In summary, the Red Bandits are rampant in the counties of Eastern Hubei. Their leader is Kuang Jixun, with more than 20,000 guns, who roams between Hubei, Henan, and Anhui. The areas of Huang, Ma, Qi, and Luo have been particularly affected.</p>
<p>▲ Southern Hubei Wuchang, the provincial capital, is still peaceful. Kong bandits occasionally harass Puqi, Chongyang, and Tongshan. In early July, they destroyed the Xiang-E Railway once. The Liu Liu brigade of the 19th Division and the Xie Bin division, together with the local militia, are searching and suppressing them, and small groups are being gradually defeated. The border areas of Yangxin, Daye, Echeng, and Xianning have been particularly disturbed due to the bandit nests in Longgang Yanxia in the southern part of Yangxin. The bandit leaders are Kong Hechong, the commander of the pseudo-16th Army, and Guo Ziming, commander of the pseudo-3rd Division, and Ye Jinbo, commander of the pseudo-Guard Division, with a total of three to four thousand guns, who coerce peasant bandits and harass the border areas of Hubei and Jiangxi. Recently, the Guo Rudong division and the Zhang Gang troops of the Northern Hubei Security Command, and the Li Brigade, are stationed in various places and have recovered Liurenba and Yinzhu in Daye. At the same time, He Yingqin also telegraphed He Chengjun, agreeing that the two provinces of Hubei and Jiangxi would send troops to jointly suppress them, to achieve the effect of a pincer attack. ▲ Western Hubei Except for Wufeng and Hefeng counties, which are the base of Wang Bingnan's group, the remaining counties only have the remnants of He and Duan, which are easy to search and suppress. Therefore, the recent Hubei Provincial Party and Government Conference divided the counties into districts for inspection. Because the bandit problem in Western Hubei is relatively light, it was decided to issue more than three hundred guns in the second phase. The border areas of Yichang, Dangyang, Songzi, Zhijiang, and Yidu have Mao bandits with more than two hundred guns. Wang Bingnan's troops have about a thousand guns, and Wen Shaolin's rebel troops have about four hundred guns. This group occupies the border area of Hunan and Hubei and occasionally harasses the border between Ba, Chang, Yi, Zhi, Gong, and Shi. Recently, they have been chased away by the army and their whereabouts are uncertain.</p>
<p>▲ Northern Hubei The situation in Northern Hubei is the most complicated. There are many bandits, and there are many miscellaneous armies. The suffering of the people is indescribable. Among the bandit groups, the Cui Erdan, Zhong Laoman, Xiao Jimin, and Gu Desheng groups have about three to four thousand guns, and the Zhong Zhichao group has about two thousand guns. These groups often harass the south, and the counties of Suixian, Yingshan, Xiangyang, Zaoyang, Guanghua, Junxian, Fangxian, and Jingzhong have all suffered. Recently, the Xiao and Gu groups are still in the area bordering Suiying and southern Henan. The Zhong bandits are burning and looting in the border area between Jingzhong, Suizao. And the Wei and Wang groups occupy Fang County and Fangxian, and Niu Yuchun's rebel troops occupy Zhushan and Zhuxi, intending to recruit and reorganize, all of which are major disasters in the Northwest. However, the Red Bandit groups Cheng Kechun and Yu Longzi in the border area between Xiangzao, Zhongyi, with about a thousand guns, have gradually been eliminated by the Fan Shisheng division and Luo Qijiang brigade. The three counties of Nanzhang, Baokang, and Gucheng are currently safe.</p>
<p>▲ Central Hubei The two groups of He Long and Duan Dechang occupied central Hubei. Before January, they had the pseudo-7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd divisions, and the pseudo-Guard Division, with about 10,000 guns, roaming in the counties of Han, Ying, Tian, Qian, Jian, and Mian, with great momentum. Wherever they went, the people were ravaged. The bandits used Zhou Laozui, Laoxinkou, and Zhuhe in Qianjiang, Mianyang, and Jianli as their bases. The pseudo-Hunan-Hubei West Provincial Government was located in Qujiawan, Jianli County. The government army also paid close attention to this group. The pacification director He Chengjun, the commander of the 10th Army Xu Yuanquan, the commander of the 13th Division Wan Yaohuang, the commander of the 41st Division Zhang Zhenhan, and the commander of the 44th Division Xiao Zhichu are all supervising the battle in the front, chasing the bandits between Tianjin, Jing, Qian, and Mian. After dozens of major and minor battles, the main force of the bandits was finally defeated. Now the remnants of He and Duan have fled in separate directions. One fled to Jingmen and was defeated by the Guo Xun and Zhang Liansan troops, one fled to Jiukou and was defeated by the Wan Yaohuang division, one fled to Qianjiang and was defeated by the Wang Lingji troops of the Sichuan Army, and one fled to Honghu and is currently being blockaded. In addition, there are two groups of local bandits, Li Fengshan and Li Ziqing, each with two to three hundred guns, occupying the border area between Jingmen, Jiangling, and Dangyang counties. After several joint suppressions by the army, Li Fengshan has been killed, but the strength has not yet been eliminated.</p>
<p>In summary, the bandit forces in Hubei and their activities can be roughly seen. However, it is difficult to obtain the truth about the situation in the bandit areas. Zhu Huaibing, the director of the Civil Affairs Department, captured a female bandit named Zhang Jinzhi during his recent inspection of various counties. She was escorted from the front to Hankou and held in the Civil Affairs Department. According to the bandit, (In the Red Bandit area, regardless of gender, everyone must perform duties. Men are on sentry duty, and women wash clothes and make shoes. Rich peasants are all monitored. If they do not obey, they are shot. All land is confiscated and redistributed. Adult men and women who can work are given three mu of land, and the old and young who cannot work are given one and a half mu of land. Deaths must be reported to the pseudo-government, and the land will be returned to the public. Births must also be reported. The grain produced by the bad land is not enough to eat. In case of food shortages, the pseudo-government concentrates the grain and distributes it first to the families of the Red Army, then to the poor peasants, and then to the rich peasants. Free business is also allowed, but merchants are not allowed to divide the land and must register with the pseudo-government. Paper money is used throughout the area. If you want to go out to buy goods, you can exchange the paper money for silver dollars from the pseudo-government. When you return, you exchange the silver dollars for paper money. Therefore, there is no shortage of salt, oil, and various foreign goods. All past debts, if rich peasants lent to poor peasants, are ordered to be destroyed. If poor people borrowed from poor people, they will repay the principal and reduce interest. For marriages, if it is an old-fashioned marriage, and the feelings are not compatible, you can apply to the pseudo-government for divorce. Those with good feelings are allowed to continue. Widows must be remarried, and child brides are not allowed. Engagements made by parents are completely invalid. Those who are not engaged can fall in love freely in multiple relationships. However, once married, they must register with the pseudo-government and will no longer be free. If one party divorces unreasonably, they will be executed. If one party has another lover and is reported by the other party, they will be punished by sitting in a starvation cell. Those who abuse their daughters-in-law, daughters-in-law who insult their parents-in-law, husbands who abuse their wives, and wives who insult their husbands are all given this punishment), etc. (August 5th)</p>

<p>A correspondent in Jinan reports that Han Fuju, chairman of the provincial government and commander-in-chief of the Third Route Army, went to Ping to attend the Political Committee. Concrete plans were discussed regarding military and political affairs in North China. After returning to Jinan, he summoned the division and brigade commanders of his troops to Jinan to report on the Ping meeting, inquire about local conditions, and discuss defense. In addition to the commander of the 20th Division Sun Tongxuan, and the commander of the 74th Division Qiao Lizhi, who are both in Jinan, Cao Fulin, commander of the 29th Division stationed in Zhoucun, arrived in Jinan last night with Li Xuande, commander of the cavalry brigade, by the Jiao-Ji third train. Gu Liangmin, commander of the 22nd Division stationed in Yanzhou, also rushed over by the Ping-Pu 202nd train at six o'clock last night. Zhan Shutang, commander of the 81st Division stationed in Linyi, arrived in Jinan at 9:28 this morning by the Jin-Pu second train, and separately met with Han. In addition to discussing defense issues and earnestly instructing them to properly maintain the local area, there will also be changes in the distribution of the garrison. It is said that Zhan Shutang's 81st Division will be transferred back to Jinan for training, and the vacated defense area will be filled by Qiao Lizhi's 74th Division transferred from Jinan to Linyi.

<h3 id="e90">Niu Lan Couple Returned to Detention Center <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Currently Detained in the Detention Center's VIP Room</p>
<p>Trial Scheduled for the 10th of this Month</p>
<p>Due to their hunger strike last month, Niu Lan and his wife were bailed out by Soong Ching-ling, Cai Yuanpei, Yang Xingfo, and others to the Jiangsu High Court and sent to Gulou Hospital for treatment. They have now fully recovered. The Jiangsu High Court has scheduled the trial for the 10th of this month. Niu Lan and his wife also submitted a request to the Jiangsu High Court yesterday to be returned to the detention center to await trial. The court then dispatched the warden of the detention center, Xi Kuan, along with police officers, to Gulou Hospital at 5 p.m. on the 5th to return Niu Lan and his wife to the detention center. The details are as follows: ▲ Decision to Return After Niu Lan and his wife were sent to Gulou Hospital for treatment, they recovered quickly. Gulou Hospital sent four letters to the Jiangsu High Court requesting that Niu Lan and his wife be returned. The court initially intended to return them earlier, but because the trial was scheduled for the 10th of this month, to avoid any unforeseen circumstances, they planned to return them the day before the trial. However, Niu Lan and his wife believed that they had fully recovered and that the court had specially prepared a VIP room for them, so they also wished to return to the detention center as soon as possible to await trial. They submitted a request to the Jiangsu High Court on the 4th, requesting immediate return. The Jiangsu High Court, seeing that Niu Lan and his wife wished to return early, decided to go to pick them up on the 5th.</p>
<p>▲Pre-Arrangements After the Jiangsu High Court decided to pick them up on the 5th, they dispatched personnel to Gulou Hospital at 2 p.m. that afternoon to settle the accounts. It was calculated that Niu Lan and his wife had been hospitalized for a total of 19 days from the 17th of last month to the present day, with all expenses totaling over 400 yuan, which were paid in full by the Jiangsu High Court. For the sake of strict security, the Jiangsu High Court also sent a letter to the Capital Police Department requesting them to send police officers to escort them. The department dispatched the captain of the special task force, Li Fanqing, leading 40 armed police officers, to Gulou Hospital before 2 p.m. to pick them up. The four military police officers and four court police officers originally stationed at the hospital also assisted in the security. Two large cars were prepared for transportation. At that time, the crowd outside Gulou Hospital reached as many as one or two hundred people, all wanting to see the faces of Niu Lan and his wife.</p>
<p>▲Letter Delivered to the Hospital The Jiangsu High Court also sent a letter to Gulou Hospital in advance, notifying them of the return of Niu Lan and his wife. The letter stated, "[Regarding the case of Niu Lan and others endangering the Republic of China, which this court has accepted, previously, Niu Lan and others became ill due to a hunger strike and should be treated. A warrant was issued, and the Jiangning District Court Prosecutor was requested to dispatch military police to bring Niu Lan, Wang Deli, and Zeng, two individuals, to your hospital for treatment. Now, there is a need to bring Niu Lan and others back for questioning. In addition to sending a letter to the Jiangning District Court Prosecutor to dispatch military police to pick them up, we hereby request your hospital to hand over Niu Lan, Wang Deli, and Zeng, two individuals, to the Jiangning District Court Prosecutor for questioning. Respectfully addressed to the Director of Nanjing Gulou Hospital, Lin Biao, President of Jiangsu High Court, signed by Li Mian, Acting Presiding Judge of Jiangsu High Court]."</p>
<p>▲Escorted Back to the Court At 4:45 p.m., Xi Kuan, the warden of the Jiangning District Court Detention Center responsible for the pick-up, arrived at Gulou Hospital and went to the ward where Niu Lan and his wife were staying, informing them of the intention to return. Niu Lan and his wife both expressed their willingness. The court police then carried Niu Lan and his wife's luggage, totaling eight pieces, onto the large car. Niu Lan and his wife walked out of the hospital side by side. Niu Lan expressed his gratitude to the staff of Gulou Hospital, saying, "Take care, see you again." Niu Lan was still wearing a Western-style suit with a lapel shirt and yellow leather shoes, while his wife was wearing a white silk Western-style suit and black satin Chinese-style slippers. Both of them had regained their original spirits and physical condition. After Niu Lan and his wife boarded the large car, they sat face to face in the front. Twelve police officers and four court police officers sat on both sides in order. Another large car was filled with police officers, and four military police officers sat in a small car. Xi Kuan and court officials also sat in another small car. At around 5 p.m., the large car carrying Niu Lan and his wife started first, followed by the military police car, Xi Kuan's car, and two motorcycles from the police department, and then another large car. They went straight to the Jiangning District Court along Zhongshan Road, arriving at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>▲Sent to the Detention Center After Niu Lan and his wife arrived at the Jiangning District Court, they were escorted to the detention center by county police. The detention center had specially prepared two VIP rooms for Niu Lan and his wife. The rooms were originally the detention center's treatment rooms, which were quite spacious and had screens installed, expressing satisfaction.</p>
<p>▲Trial Scheduled The Jiangsu High Court has scheduled the trial for the 10th of this month. Subpoenas have been delivered to Niu Lan and his wife, and subpoenas for witnesses have also been sent to the Jiangsu High Court Second Branch in Shanghai for substituted service. All are expected to arrive in Nanjing on time for the court hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Legislative Yuan Reviews Ministry of Education Organization Act <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Deemed No Revision Necessary</p>
<p>At the 196th meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 6th, the Legal System Committee of the Yuan reported on its review of the revised draft of the Ministry of Education Organization Act. The gist of the review: (1) No revision is necessary for the Ministry of Education Organization Act; (2) The establishment of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau without legislative procedure should be questioned. It was resolved that the review report be adopted. The original report is recorded as follows: [This case was resolved by the 191st meeting of this Yuan and referred to this committee for review. In compliance, discussions were held at the 159th, 160th, and 161st meetings of this committee. It was generally agreed that reviewing educational books, instruments, and other educational supplies is an important function of educational administration and should be handled by the Ministry of Education itself. The revised draft transfers the review of educational books, specimens, instruments, and other educational supplies for schools below the secondary level to the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, with only the review and approval matters listed in the responsibilities of the General Education Department. The authority is inconsistent, and the handling is likely to be obstructed. The current regulations of the Ministry of Education Organization Act are more appropriate and do not require revision. As for the attached draft of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau Organization Regulations, as stipulated in Article 4 of the regulations, it is essentially a disguised expansion of the Editing and Compilation Department of the Ministry of Education, which is not commensurate with the name. Moreover, it concerns the organization of national agencies, and its promulgation and implementation by ministerial order without legislative procedure is a clear violation of legislative authority and should be questioned by this Yuan in accordance with the law. Whether all the review results are appropriate is reported accordingly and respectfully submitted to the general assembly for public resolution.]</p>

<p>Autopsy Ordered in Case of Woman Beaten to Death by Family Members Gu, the daughter-in-law of Wu Haibo of Xiximen Waima Guanxiatang, was usually abused by her parents-in-law and repeatedly blamed for no reason. On the 29th of last month, Gu was severely beaten by her family members again and took the opportunity to escape. However, she was found and brought back by her mother-in-law and suffered even more beatings. She died from her injuries at 4 p.m. Wu immediately purchased a coffin and prepared for burial. The incident was discovered by Zhu Junxian, the deputy chief of the town, who requested Han Shouyi, the patrol captain of the local police station, to investigate. However, the Wu family bribed the patrol captain, Han, who disregarded everything and reported to the precinct officer Yuan Yingqiu that she had died by suicide. Officer Gu did not examine the facts and was deceived by Han. Neighbors, dissatisfied with the report, requested the general bureau to send personnel to investigate. The bureau chief immediately dispatched Inspector Zhang Tian to investigate and learned that Gu had indeed died from beatings. Wu Haibo, his wife Sun, his son Jinsheng, and his daughters Qu and Jia were taken to the bureau to be interrogated and then escorted to the county for questioning. They all claimed that Gu had died by suicide. The two daughters were released on bail in court. However, the news of Gu's death being due to beating spread throughout the city. The next day, five neighbors and eighteen merchants from Xiximen jointly petitioned the county government to order an autopsy and provided a guarantee. After receiving the petition, the county government stated that the matter was significant and difficult to approve without a petition from the deceased's relatives. On the 3rd, Gu's mother, Chen, and maternal uncle, Chen Naifen, learned of the incident in Shanghai and came to Kunshan to petition the county government to order an autopsy to clarify the cause of death. Chen Ying, the trial officer, accompanied by the autopsy official and the Wu family, including Wu Haibo, went to open the coffin for examination. The examination revealed that the deceased had bruises all over her body, with dozens of injuries. However, Trial Officer Chen only instructed Wu Haibo to re-coffin Gu and ordered the headman to guard the coffin. He also told Gu's mother, Chen, and Chen Naifen, that the injuries of the deceased had been examined and would be investigated further. Observers at the scene, believing that Trial Officer Chen and the autopsy official were handling the corpse perfunctorily, immediately protested, almost surrounding Chen. Later, patrol officers protected Chen and others, allowing them to return safely.</p>

<p>Rental Disputes After Military Conflict Since the January 28th Shanghai Incident, all businesses in this county have been greatly affected. After the Japanese army invaded the territory on March 1st, they all suspended operations one after another until the signing of the peace treaty, when they gradually resumed business. The direct and indirect losses were enormous. After the resumption of business, the businesses that rented premises organized a Tenants' Association to request landlords to waive rent for several months as a gesture of sympathy. Meetings were held repeatedly, but few landlords attended. In desperation, they jointly petitioned the authorities, requesting them to uphold justice, but to no avail. As a result, the disputes remain unresolved and conflicts arise from time to time. The other day, the Yilimei Foreign Goods Store and others requested the landlord Hu Qiwei to waive two months' rent, but Hu refused, insisting that the store had not suffered direct losses. Conflicts arose between the two sides, and neither would give way. Fortunately, Mr. Zhou Fuchang came forward to mediate and resolved the matter by waiving one month's rent.</p>
<p>▲Widespread Epidemic Claims Entire Family It has been reported in this newspaper several times that an epidemic is raging in this county. It is now learned that the family of Gu Shuyan, the township head of Wu Jing Township outside the Xijing West Gate in this county, has been wiped out, with all five members dying from the epidemic. The first to fall ill was Gu's eldest son, and within two days, it spread to his four-year-old daughter, followed by Gu himself. Finally, his mother and daughter-in-law also died one after another, leaving no one to prepare the bodies for burial. It is truly tragic.</p>

<p>▲Record of a Defamation Case The resident Bao Yi, because lawyer Zhang Tongjin was hired as the legal counsel of the Lao Zhenghe Dyeing Factory by Chen Eryu in August of last year, suddenly represented another client, Wang Yunzhong, in May of this year, filing a lawsuit against Chen Eryu to demand the surrender of premises, believing that the lawyer had violated the Lawyers' Regulations. He immediately sent a letter to the Suzhou-Wuxi Lawyers' Association, requesting that the matter be referred to the superior supervisory authority for full punishment. At the same time, he sent the draft letter to the local newspaper for publication. He also filed a complaint with the County Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing the lawyer of violating regulations. After seeing the report in the newspaper, Zhang Tongjin believed that Bao Yi was spreading words and defaming his reputation. He immediately filed a private prosecution with the court and sent a letter to various newspapers for correction. The letter stated, "[Who is Bao Yi? Is the community still aware that he is the one who accused people of consuming opium, infringing upon this lawyer's lawful execution of duties?]" After reading the newspaper, Bao Yi also believed that Zhang Tongjin was defaming his reputation. He immediately filed a counterclaim with the court and published a warning to Zhang Tongjin in the newspaper. After seeing the warning, Zhang Tongjin immediately published a solemn announcement, stating, "[This lawyer has always respected morality, justice, law-abidingness, and loyalty in the lawful execution of duties, hence attracting the jealousy of petty people who conspire to undermine this lawyer's credibility.]" After reading the newspaper, Bao Yi immediately published an advertisement in the newspaper, seeking information about Zhang Tongjin's deeds of respecting morality, justice, and law-abidingness. Zhang Tongjin believed that Bao Yi was publicly insulting him and filed another charge of insult with the court. Bao Yi further filed a charge of false accusation against Zhang with the court. It was a mixed bag, demonstrating the ultimate legal struggle. At 12 p.m. on the 5th (the day before yesterday), Judge Wang Kequan opened the court for this case. Bao Yi hired lawyer Sun Zuhong to appear in court to defend him. Both sides engaged in a heated debate, speaking eloquently for a long time. Finally, Zhang Tongjin requested to withdraw the private prosecution in court. Bao Yi's lawyer immediately stood up and stated that he would not withdraw the counterclaim. As a result, Judge Wang instructed them to await further summons for verification and handling, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<p>▲Chamber of Commerce Suddenly Receives Bullet Warning Letter The "Blood Soul Anti-Traitor Corps" is active in Wuxi, causing panic among traitorous merchants. The other day, the County Chamber of Commerce suddenly received a letter from the Anti-Traitor Corps, containing a bullet. The general idea of the original letter was that many traitorous merchants in Wuxi were importing enemy goods. The Chamber of Commerce, leading the merchants, should be responsible for strictly investigating and prohibiting this. A bullet is first sent as a warning. If traitorous merchants in Wuxi are found to be transporting enemy goods again in the future, they will be rewarded with bullets. The corps also sent letters to various newspapers, publishing their plan to deal with the mastermind traitorous merchants separately, dealing with them with the most severe means. In addition to taking their lives, they will also burn their Japanese goods. The end of the corps' letter also stated that the corps would not investigate previous goods with the Chamber of Commerce's seal. It is a gentleman's way to correct one's mistakes. The merchants should strive to do so.</p>

<p>▲District Head Accused of Election Fraud Qin Shifang, the district head of the fifth district of the county, was ordered to hold the Zouzhen election. On July 29th, he went to Beian Township to elect the township head. At that time, citizens such as Zhao Huanzhang went to observe and saw that the printed election tickets were all filled with the word "Sui". When the votes were counted, the elected township head was indeed Dai Suiling. Moreover, there were only about 100 people who came to vote that day, but the number of votes cast was more than 300, which was clearly fraudulent. They reported the witnessed situation in detail to the county government, requesting them to send a supervisor for the re-election and submit the election tickets as evidence, requesting strict punishment according to law.</p>

<p>▲Dragon Boat Race Outside the South Gate Causes Disaster Since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been hot, and epidemics have been rampant, with many who contract the disease dying. According to the investigation and statistics of the Public Security Bureau, as of the end of July, no fewer than 500 people have died from epidemics. In the Xitang Qiao area of the fifth district, coffins are nowhere to be bought. The severity of the epidemic can be seen in general. Then, well-wishers, in order to drive away plagues and exorcise evil spirits, launched a dragon lantern procession. Every night, gongs and drums could be heard everywhere. The Public Security Bureau, fearing that it would cause trouble, issued a notice prohibiting it and ordered Yang Jinhai, the leader, to write a guarantee. The matter was then suspended. However, as soon as the dragon lantern procession ended, a dragon king procession was launched. As a result, dragon kings could be seen every ten steps and every five steps along the streets, with colored lanterns hanging high and sincere prayers offered, hoping for abundant rainfall. The other day, Yang Jinhai still took the lead in promoting dragon boat races. At about 10 p.m. on the 5th, while the dragon boat race was in progress, a passenger boat carrying many passengers went to watch. The passengers stood high on the boat, causing it to capsize. All the passengers were submerged. After people tried their best to rescue them for about half an hour, many people were rescued. However, Gu Shanren, Wang Xiangbao, and Zhu Xiaojin, all three locals, had already died. Yang Jinhai, the leader of the event, upon hearing the news, believed that he was responsible for the incident and fainted. The Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts. On the one hand, they immediately arrested Yang Jinhai, the leader. On the other hand, they removed the precinct officer of the area, Fang Desheng, from his post for failing to prevent the incident beforehand and for failing to resolve the disaster afterwards.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Wang Jingwei Came to Shanghai Yesterday Morning and Suddenly Submitted His Resignation to the Central Government <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Telegraphs Zhang Xueliang Requesting Resignation to Apologize to the Nation</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong to Concurrently Act as Representative of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Wang's Resignation Intention Is Firm, His Whereabouts in Shanghai Are Secret</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, recently felt that foreign affairs and financial issues were thorny, and his attitude suddenly turned negative. At 6:20 yesterday morning, Wang, accompanied by Zeng Zhongming, the Vice Minister of Railways, and Tang Youren, his secretary, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing by special train. He once visited Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, to explain the pain of having to resign and asked Song to go to Nanjing immediately to act as the President of the Executive Yuan. At noon, he sent five resignation telegrams to the Central Executive Committee, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Military Commission Chairman Jiang, the ministers of various departments, and Zhang Xueliang. Wang did not return to his residence all day yesterday, and his whereabouts were very secret. He was originally scheduled to receive reporters from various newspapers at 4:00 pm yesterday, but his secretary temporarily brought a handwritten note from Wang to the reporters, saying that he could not meet with them due to business. There were five telegrams to be published. It can be seen that Wang's intention to resign is very firm. Details and the text of the resignation telegram are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Visiting Song Ziwen Wang's special train consisted of two carriages, which left Nanjing at 9:30 the night before last and arrived at Zhenru Station at 6:20 yesterday morning. Chen Xinghan, the director of the two railway bureaus, personally waited at the station and arranged everything with strict precautions, refusing reporters to enter the platform. Wang was wearing a white silk gown yesterday, hurriedly left the station and boarded a car, looking quite unhappy. After returning to his residence and taking a short rest, he visited Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, stating that he had already resigned and begged Song to return to Nanjing immediately as the Vice President of the Executive Yuan to act as the President of the Executive Yuan. After talking until about 9:00, Wang left. He then met with Chen Gongbo, Zeng Zhongming, and others to discuss everything. At about 11:00, Wang went to Dr. Nauer's hospital on Avenue Joffre to have Dr. Nauer examine his illness. He rested at a friend's place in the afternoon, and his whereabouts were extremely secret.</p>
<p>▲ Main Reason for Wang's Resignation The outside world has speculated a lot about Wang's sudden resignation. Wang himself has made it very clear in his telegram to Zhang Xueliang. Therefore, the financial problem is the main reason for Wang's resignation. When Song Ziwen, the Minister of Finance, resigned and came to Shanghai last time, Wang came to Shanghai repeatedly to persuade him to stay, and even said that he would leave together. After Song resumed his post, he was planning to plan the central government's financial measures, but Rehe suddenly became urgent again. Wang repeatedly telegraphed Zhang to send troops, but he used the excuse of lack of funds and equipment and never gave a satisfactory reply. At the same time, military expenses for suppressing bandits and other items required money everywhere. Wang felt the pain of having no rice to cook, and the saying that the Lushan Conference would be held again could not be realized for a while. Therefore, Wang had to take the resolute path of resignation.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Central Executive Committee To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, Jian: On January 28, Zhaoming was humbly elected as the President of the Executive Yuan, originally hoping to do his best to save the country from its difficulties. However, months have passed, and things have gone against my wishes. After repeated consideration, I have no choice but to submit my resignation to give way to the worthy. If you approve, Zhaoming will immediately return to Nanjing to sincerely appeal. I respectfully ask for your approval. Wang Zhaoming, August 6.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Chairman of the National Government To the Civil Affairs Office of the National Government in Luoyang, to Chairman Lin of Guling, Jian: Since Zhaoming humbly took charge of the administration on January 28, I originally hoped to do my best to save the country from its difficulties. However, months have passed, and things have gone against my wishes. After repeated consideration, I have no choice but to submit my resignation to give way to the worthy. In addition to submitting to the Central Executive Committee, I hereby appeal for your approval. I cannot express my prayers enough. Wang Zhaoming, August 6.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Ministers of Various Departments To Vice President Song in Shanghai, Minister Huang of the Ministry of Interior in Nanjing, Minister Luo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Navy, Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, Minister Gu of the Ministry of Railways, Chairman Liu of the Anti-Smoking Committee, Chairman Shi of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Chairman Chen of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Jian: Zhaoming has resigned to the Central Executive Committee and Chairman Lin of the National Government. The reasons are detailed in the telegram to Director Zhang Xueliang. This is actually the reason for my personal retirement and has nothing to do with the entire Executive Yuan. Before the Central Government elects a successor, please ask Vice President Song to act as the President of the Yuan in accordance with the law. Before Vice President Song arrives in Nanjing, the affairs of the Executive Yuan will be handled by Minister Huang on his behalf, and Minister Huang will preside over the Executive Yuan meetings. The affairs of various ministries and committees should proceed as usual. This is specially reported, and I respectfully ask you to check it. Wang Zhaoming, August 6.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Chairman Jiang To Chairman Jiang in Hankou, Jian: Zhaoming has submitted to the Central Executive Committee to approve my resignation as President of the Executive Yuan. I plan to return to Nanjing after the approval to serve in the Central Party Headquarters. Before returning to Nanjing, the Political Council must have a standing committee member preside over the meeting, so I hope you will return to Nanjing to preside over the meeting. I am very grateful. Your brother, Wang Zhaoming, August 6.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Zhang Xueliang To Director Zhang Hanqing, Commander of the Pacification Headquarters in Beiping, Jian: Looking back, brother, last year, you abandoned Shenyang and then lost Jinzhou, causing 30 million people and hundreds of thousands of miles of land to fall into the hands of the enemy. The enemy's arrogance increased, extending to Shanghai. Relying on the 19th Route Army and the 5th Route Army to fight to the death to defend our nation's survival and our country's personality, this is a very unusual event, not what I expected from you. However, I also hoped that you would be inspired by your conscience to see yourself. You have been procrastinating for years without making any achievements, and the enemy's atmosphere is becoming more and more rampant. Rehe is in urgent need. The Central Army is engaged in suppressing bandits and fighting in Xunshu, braving all kinds of hardships. However, for the sake of stabilizing the interior and consolidating the rear, it is our duty to do so. In addition, only you have the most troops and the most powerful military appearance. The enemy troops are harassing within your defense zone. Therefore, in terms of strength, responsibility for war, and geographical convenience, resisting the enemy is something that no one else can do in your position. You must know that China is the China of the Chinese people. All members of the race have the obligation to hold weapons to defend the country. When the 19th Route and 5th Route Armies fought in Shanghai, they did so based on this righteousness. What else could they ask for? When the war was in full swing, the Central Government exhausted all its resources to supply the front line, and the people carried grain and followed to help boost morale. Now, you have not heard of a single soldier being sent or a single arrow being fired. You want to use the name of resistance to engage in aggregation. Since a declaration to defend against foreign insults, what you have asked of the Ministry of Finance is to raise 5 million, at least 2 million first. What you have asked of the Ministry of Railways is to raise 2 million. Yesterday, you asked the Executive Yuan to raise 3 million per month to help Rehe. At a time when the people are poor and resources are exhausted, the Central Government's finances are exhausted. You must know this. You must use this to coerce. I really don't understand what you are thinking. No matter whether the Central Government has this financial capacity or not, even if it does, before you actually resist, I will never bear to waste it. I am really incompetent and cannot collect the fat of the people to satisfy your desires, causing you to be disappointed in me. I have no choice but to resign to apologize to you alone, and to make it clear that there is nothing else. I only hope that you will also resign to apologize to the 400 million people of the country, and do not let Rehe and Tianjin become the continuation of the Northeast Jinzhou. Then China in Guanxi will be very fortunate. It is up to you to decide. Wang Zhaoming, August.</p>

<p>▲ The Municipal Public Security Bureau Is Investigating</p>
<p>▲ The Head of the French Concession Police Station Also Forgives</p>
<p>▲ Various Trade Associations Issue Declarations</p>
<p>At about 9:00 pm the night before last, a bomb exploded at Maochang Foreign Goods Store, No. 347, Minquan Road. Yun Huifang, a 16-year-old youth, was arrested by the police on duty. After Director Xu of the First Section of the Second District questioned him and found a letter on his person, he sent him to the General Bureau overnight because the circumstances were serious. At about 10:00 yesterday morning, Xie Zao, a staff member of the Third Section, designated by Wu Zhiquan, the head of the Third Section, interrogated him. Yun confessed without denial and made anti-Japanese remarks because of his hot-blooded impulse. Xie stopped him because it was not within the scope of the case. It is now learned that Yun Huifang is under the legal age and because of the anti-Japanese movement, many parties are willing to guarantee him and ask for leniency. However, the Bureau is in the process of investigating and has not made any statement.</p>
<p>Yun Huifang, a patriotic teenager from the Blood Soul Eradication Group, threw a bomb at Maochang Foreign Goods Store, No. 347, Minquan Road, in the French Concession the night before last. After being arrested by the police of the First Branch of the Second District of the Public Security Bureau, Director Xu considered the case to be serious and sent him to the General Bureau at 11:00 that night. However, Chief Inspector Fabre of the French Concession Police Station, because the case occurred in the Concession, in order to clarify the facts, specially sent Chinese and Western detectives to the Public Security Bureau yesterday morning to request an interview and stated that after a brief interrogation, he would send him back. Director Wen immediately agreed and sent Yun to the detective to the Police Station. After the head of the Police Station interrogated Yun in detail, he recognized that Yun was completely an underage child, expressed forgiveness, and advised Yun in person. It is expected that Yun will still have to be sent back to the Public Security Bureau in one or two days.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Coal Ash Factory Industry, Lime Sales Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, Intestine Industry, Sugar Industry, Flying Flower Industry, North-South Goods Demolition Industry, Sauce and Wine Industry, Paint and Woodware Industry, Tourism Industry, Local Goods Industry, Bamboo Industry, Shoe Industry, Parasol Industry, Pawnshop Industry, Bookstore Industry, Leather Nail and Shoe Tree Industry, New Law Laundry Industry, Foil Industry, Straw Mat Industry, Meat Industry, Duck Slaughtering Industry, Silk and Satin Industry, and other more than 80 industry associations, issued a declaration yesterday, saying, "On September 18 last year, the Shenyang Incident occurred, and the country lost hundreds of thousands of square miles of territory overnight. This kind of tragedy is unprecedented. The people, because they could not bear to lose the Northeast and then lose China, rose up to save themselves. Therefore, there are two major organizations, one is the Northeast Volunteer Army, and the other is the Blood Soul Eradication Group. The Japanese occupy our Eastern Provinces, and we should use the people's military force to save ourselves. Traitorous merchants use the money of our people's blood and sweat to increase the enemy's tools of aggression. In terms of their intentions and actions, they should also be treated as enemies. Therefore, the Volunteer Army is for external affairs, and the Eradication Group is for internal affairs. In terms of their goals, they are actually standing on the same position of recovering the lost territory in the Northeast and carrying out activities. If the government permits it, gathering crowds, preparing weapons, and engaging in war with a foreign country with which diplomatic relations have not yet been severed seems inappropriate. But if someone suddenly advocates this view now and accuses the Northeast Volunteer Army of resisting violent aggression as inappropriate, I know that the people of the whole country will surely laugh at that person as being insane. Why? Because the country cannot use military force to resist violent aggression, the people rise up to save themselves. The law can only take a kind of permissive behavior and cannot use the so-called crime of harming foreign relations in criminal law. The country cannot use economic blockade strategies to prohibit trade with aggressors by force. The people use military force to裁制. This is the origin of the Eradication Group organization. The group's actions, even if they exceed the regulations, are similar to the situation of the Volunteer Army fighting with foreign countries privately without orders. The country has no reason to punish the Volunteer Army with this item of law, then the country, under this special environment, also has no way to enforce the law to interfere with the patriotic warriors' actions of eradicating traitors. It can only expand the scope of Article 37 of the Criminal Law and give it a non-punishment face. This is hereby declared."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation convened various groups yesterday to hold a meeting to reduce and exempt rent. After the adjournment of the joint meeting, five representatives of the patriotic warriors who were rescued immediately held a meeting to discuss the rescue methods in detail. The methods are roughly as follows: (1) Contact various groups separately and ask them to jointly find ways to rescue; (2) Contact legal groups; (3) Comfort the families of the warriors. Starting today, they will proceed actively in separate ways.</p>
<h3 id="e105">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Earnestly Admonishes Various Industries <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>▲ Comply with the Resolutions of the Members' Meeting</p>
<p>▲ Implement the Economic Severance with Japan</p>
<p>▲ Do Not Dye Cut-off Machine Heads and Piece Heads</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, based on the resolutions of the members' meeting many times, sent letters to various industries, earnestly admonishing them to implement the economic severance with Japan and quickly stop privately importing Japanese goods, and also sent letters to various dyeing industry groups, telling them not to dye cut-off machine heads and piece heads to prevent confusion. The original letter is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>▲ Notice to Various Industries Dear Sirs, Since the Japanese occupied Shenyang on September 18 last year, this Association convened a temporary general meeting of member representatives on September 28 to discuss methods for dealing with national difficulties. Among the important resolutions, there are the following items: (3) Thorough and permanent economic severance with Japan. If any buying and selling with Japan is found, the people will strictly judge the case; (4) Notify the silver and money houses to stop providing loans to merchants dealing in Japanese goods from now on. If any violations are found, they will be regarded as undermining the anti-Japanese movement; (5) Notify various industry associations to establish Japanese goods inspection teams from now on to conduct self-inspection. All of this is to show the determination of merchants to automatically resist goods and increase the country's long-term strength to resist insults. From a general point of view, if this resolution can be followed consistently, then Japanese goods imported into Shanghai should have disappeared long ago. However, from November last year to March this year, Japanese goods imported from Central China, although reduced to 80% to 84%, gradually returned to normal afterwards, becoming more and more prosperous. As for the recent reports, there have been cases of one shipment arriving with more than 16,000 pieces, and the total value of the bills issued is as high as 20 million yuan, which is shocking. To this end, people are approaching step by step, gaining three provinces and gradually plotting North China, while we regard it as a past event and forget it indifferently. With such a bloodless and spineless nation, how can we be worthy of the world? Therefore, the loss of land is not painful, but only the shamelessness of serving the enemy and being slaughtered by others is painful. Merchants have suffered from economic aggression and the scars of the Shanghai War in recent years, and they should have realized this early and stood on the people's front line as the vanguard of resisting insults. However, they have turned to be driven by their own private interests, willing to be spurned and scolded by all parties without repentance. What about the personality of the business community? Therefore, this Association dares to warn the compatriots in the entire business community that if the trafficking of Japanese goods continues, it is no different from jointly destroying our China. The only difference is that the Japanese contribute their efforts, and our merchants contribute their funds. This Association clearly knows that there are many self-respecting people in the business community. However, recently, the import of Japanese goods has been so prosperous. If there is no way out, how can there be a source? The situation in this regard cannot be denied by empty words. Reports from all parties are coming one after another, and they cannot be said to be unfounded. I hope that all merchants in our city will correct their mistakes if they have them and encourage themselves if they don't. Each industry association should have the ambition to never allow any slackness and restrain its members so that they will no longer leave themselves open to criticism. Merchants who are used to trafficking in Japanese goods should not say that they have been in business for a long time and cannot change their business. You must know that you can choose domestic or Western goods as you please. If you have sufficient capital, how difficult is it to find another way out? If the government had decided to resist after the Shenyang Incident, and the Japanese goods merchants had been in a state of war and blockade until now, would they rather give up and wait for death and seek to change their business? This shows that they must not be so. The Japanese goods merchants have always thought that selling Japanese goods is the best option, and they are also mistaken by this idea of ​​苟安. At this time when the national crisis is becoming more and more pressing, if you want to sell Japanese goods for a long time, you will definitely not be allowed by the environment. Instead of ending up in disgrace and ruin, why not change your plans as soon as possible? I hope you will consider the words of medicine and stone calmly.</p>
<p>▲ Advice to Merchants Our country's economic severance with Japan was originally intended to resist Japan's aggression against the Northeast. Now, Japan has publicly declared to the world about the Northeast that it has occupied that it will never return it to China, and even further has the act of forcing Rehe and attacking Tianjin and Beiping. Our country should intensify its resistance to make Japanese goods never have the chance to revive in China, or it may promote their awareness. However, you suddenly import a large amount of Japanese goods at this time, so that Japanese businessmen will restore their original state and carry out activities on a large scale, increasing their economic strength to prepare for the conquest of the entire China. The Japanese want to use those who destroy the Northeast to destroy China, and the traitorous merchants who sell Japanese goods are helping them from the side. To put it simply, it is no different from jointly destroying our China, with the Japanese contributing their efforts and the traitorous merchants contributing their money. I am extremely heartbroken, and I am especially writing to advise you, hoping that you will quickly stop the act of privately importing Japanese goods, otherwise it will be difficult to escape the sanctions of society.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Ice Seafood Industry Notifies Members to Reject Selling Inferior Goods Forever <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Ice Seafood Fish Industry Association, in view of the current national crisis, based on the principle of conscience and saving the country, in order to prevent members from deceiving the association and privately selling inferior goods, causing domestic goods to fall into a state of decline, specially convened all members on the 5th of this month to hold a temporary emergency meeting. Almost all members attended, and they were all generous and enthusiastic, and unanimously advocated never selling inferior goods forever and making every effort to promote domestic products.

With the unanimous decision of all members at the emergency meeting on the 5th of this month, in addition to notifying all members, the principle of correcting the mistakes if they have them and encouraging themselves if they don't, they must all adhere to their original intentions, without the slightest change, and pledge to reject inferior goods and promote domestic products. In addition, this association secretly dispatches inspectors to secretly investigate and detect them. If there are members who are still insane, risking impropriety, secretly planning to make huge profits, and privately selling inferior goods, once they are found out, all inferior goods will be detained and submitted to the executive committee for fair discussion.

<h3 id="e107">Japanese Warships Protect Cargo Transportation <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>▲ Four Measures Formulated to Be Implemented Starting from the 4th</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Merchants Request Strict Prohibition of Anti-Japanese Groups</p>
<p>Armed Protection of Japanese Goods Transportation to the Yangtze River Estuary Dumping Measures</p>
<p>Organizations and Zuojinsi, Commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy, have completed discussions. However, Zuojinsi handed over the matter entirely to Sugisaka, Commander of the Marine Corps, because he was about to go on巡武漢 in a few days. Starting from the resumption of Japanese shipping on August 1, armed protection of Japanese goods will be carried out to dump them in the Yangtze River Estuary. The reporter of Shiwenshe specially inquired about various news from the Japanese side yesterday and recorded them as follows.</p>
<p>▲ Armed Protection of Cargo Transportation After Commander Zuojinsi of the First Fleet transferred full authority to Commander Sugisaka of the Marine Corps to handle the armed protection of cargo transportation, Commander Sugisaka immediately issued a letter to overseas Chinese the day before yesterday, detailing his determination to provide armed protection for cargo transportation. At the same time, he summoned important figures from various businesses in Shanghai to discuss the implementation measures. It was immediately formulated that (1) starting from the 4th of this month, for Japanese goods transported from Shanghai to the Yangtze River Estuary area, before the cargo ships have set sail, four warships will be transferred from the First Foreign Fleet to Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, and other destinations where Japanese goods are unloaded, to wait for the cargo ships to arrive and implement armed protection for unloading; (2) On the cargo ships departing from Shanghai, officers D. Yuhara, Yokoo, Aoki, Inamura, Kakusho, Oshio, Sugiki, Ono, Fukumoto, Okajima, etc., who have been newly transferred from Tokyo, will take turns to provide armed protection, and the Marine Corps Headquarters will send 20 armed Marine Corps soldiers to each cargo ship to assist; (3) For goods shipped from the country to Shanghai, the Marine Corps Headquarters may, according to the situation, protect the safe unloading of the goods when reporting to customs for unloading. After the above four measures were deemed satisfactory by various Japanese commercial organizations in Shanghai, they were implemented the day before yesterday. As a result, the Yangtze River Maru of the Nisshin Shipping Company still loaded a large batch of Japanese goods worth about 800,000 yuan when it sailed to Hankou the day before yesterday, transporting them to the Yangtze River Estuary for unloading, including 60 boxes in Wuhu, 35 boxes in Jiujiang, 20 boxes in Yichang, and the most in Wuhan, about 100 boxes.</p>
<p>▲ Countermeasures against Anti-Japanese Policies Since the Blood Soul Eradication Group, Iron Blood Eradication Group, etc., have successively launched activities, the Japanese business organizations in Shanghai have been greatly alarmed. Recently, the organizations of the group, etc., have been established throughout the country, which has a great impact on the policy of dumping Japanese goods. Therefore, joint meetings have been held in the Japanese resident group for several consecutive days to strictly prevent measures. However, as a result of the discussion, in addition to recommending representatives to petition the consul stationed in Shanghai, requesting the municipal government to strictly prohibit it, there are no other practical measures. Because the navy authorities can be responsible for the armed protection of Japanese goods transported to various places for dumping, whether or not the Chinese merchants are willing to trade depends entirely on the personal attitude of the Chinese merchants. The navy authorities have no right to force them to承銷. However, the reporter of Shiwenshe also received reliable news from the Japanese side yesterday that the Japanese merchants in Shanghai have made further requests to the military and political authorities to quickly and strictly prohibit the activities of various anti-Japanese groups in Shanghai, and will also send a letter to the工部局, requesting strict suppression of the Blood Soul Eradication Group, etc., which throw bombs and threaten, and impose the crime of disrupting public order. However, whether the Japanese side can implement this measure and whether the 工部局 can accept it is still a question, but the Japanese business community has submitted this opinion to the military and political authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Public Statements from Various Trade Associations Regarding Abolishing the Tael and Changing to the Yuan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>▲ General Agreement on Principles</p>
<p>▲ But Emphasis on New Currency and Paper Money</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce considers the abolition of the tael and change to the yuan to be of great importance. It previously sent a letter to Mr. Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, inquiring about three points: (1) the weight and fineness of the new currency, (2) the method of converting taels to yuan, and (3) how to ensure public understanding. A circular was sent to various industries in the city to solicit opinions. In addition to the sugar industry and over ten other trade associations that have already expressed their views on these three points, as previously reported, the Chamber has now received replies from nine more trade associations, including the silk and satin industry. Key points are summarized below:</p>
<p>▲ Silk and Satin Industry: At a time when prices are falling and industry and commerce are suffering hidden losses, this policy is particularly urgent and a crucial plan that cannot be delayed. However, in all things there are often advantages and disadvantages. Before promoting benefits, it is essential to eliminate drawbacks. The crux of the disorder in our country's currency system lies in the lack of uniformity in prices and circulation. The Association believes that the abolition of the tael and change to the yuan is intended to unify the currency system. During implementation, three practical preparations must be made: (1) The fineness of the new currency, the decimal system, and all uses nationwide must be unified. (2) The fineness of coins must not be lower than the current weight. Coinage must be absolutely open and verifiable. (3) The issuance of paper money should have substantial reserves, absolutely guaranteed, and must not be suspended for redemption.</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Medicine Industry: (1) All provincial mints should be abolished simultaneously, and coinage should be exclusively under the Central Mint. Only then can the right to mint currency be unified, and the important weights and fineness of the new currency will not vary. (2) The right to issue paper money by all ordinary banks should be abolished simultaneously and uniformly, and be exclusively under the Central Bank. The banknotes should not have place names printed on them and should be exchangeable and redeemable everywhere.</p>
<p>▲ Western Paint Industry: (1) The weight and fineness of the new currency should follow the regulations of the currency system of the Third Year of the Republic. Trade groups should be convened to form a committee to supervise the implementation or conduct periodic verification, and the results should be reported and publicly announced. (2) The conversion of silver taels involves national debts and obligations. Chambers of commerce in various regions should be responsible for convening various industries to impartially and moderately stipulate rates or adopt the average silver price from the 18th, 19th, 20th, and 23rd years of the Republic as the legal price. (3) For unified issuance, a special treasury should be established, and the reserve fund should be in accordance with legal requirements, with at least 60% in cash. No other types of funds should be used for substitution, and it must be subject to public inspection by legal organizations at any time.</p>
<p>▲ Taxi Industry: (1) The new currency must have a moderate value. (2) The conversion ratio should be publicly stipulated. (3) The issuance reserve should be strictly inspected.</p>
<p>▲ Ice Fresh Fish Industry: The Association believes that if the government wants to rectify the currency system, it should start with reorganizing coins and paper money. Its proposals are as follows: (1) When minting new silver coins, all old coins circulating in the market must be uniformly withdrawn.</p>
<p>It is Most Important that the New Currency's Supply and Demand Correspond, The People Throughout the Country Must Have the Right to Supervise Coinage. (2) To reorganize paper money, a special bureau should be established with the right to unified issuance, and the reserve must be legal. Paper money not issued by the special bureau should be abolished. With legal reserves, inspections will be easy to carry out. (3) If the above two items can be implemented, the abolition of the tael and change to the yuan will be easily resolved. As for how to convert taels to yuan, chambers of commerce in various regions should be responsible for moderately stipulating rates based on the circumstances.</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Yarn Industry: The Association did not list specific opinions but generally agreed with the letter from the money exchange industry to Mr. Chen Xing and Mr. Ma Ji-liang's written opinions, and deeply admired Mr. Yu Qiaqing's telegram, considering it a deeply experienced view.</p>
<p>▲ Paper Industry: (1) The lack of uniformity in our country's coins, paper money, and subsidiary coins is just like the complexity of silver taels. Therefore, if the abolition of the tael and change to the yuan does not start from unifying the currency system, the effect will be minimal. A joint research committee should convene economic experts and industrial and commercial leaders from various provinces to discuss the crux of the matter, so that the entire currency system can be truly unified. (2) After the abolition of the tael and change to the yuan, all silver dollars will be used. Will all the previous premiums, appreciation, and water deductions still exist? (3) International trade has always converted using silver taels. After the abolition of the tael and change to the yuan, how can the new currency become the standard for the international trade currency system? (4) When using the new and old currencies, the old currencies should be gradually withdrawn. If the weight of the new currency is lower than the old currency, it is difficult to guarantee that unscrupulous people will not privately melt them down. If so, the value of the old silver coins will inevitably exceed the new currency. Although the government can easily withdraw them, the difference between the coinage cost and the silver color will inevitably increase the national treasury's expenditure. Is there any preparation for this? (5) When silver dollars are used together, most of the reserves are provided with sufficient silver (i.e., silver ingots). After the abolition of the tael and change to the yuan, the value of silver will naturally exist. Will silver ingots still be used for reserves in the future?</p>
<p>▲ Rickshaw Industry: The Association only focuses on Mr. Chen Xing's second principle, because all large and small shops have considerable contracts with the silver and money industry. If the foreign exchange rates are not stipulated first, disputes will continue. As long as this item is handled properly, there will be no social objections. As for the weight, fineness, and legal price of the new currency, the currency regulations of advanced countries in the East and West should be followed, and the currency should be minted according to the actual values. It must also be supervised and verified by various industry groups to ensure uniformity.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Xian Xiang: (1) The weight and fineness of the new currency should have certain regulations, and the public and organizations should be allowed the right to supervise. (2) The exchange rate between silver taels and silver dollars should solicit opinions from all relevant parties to determine an impartial method. (3) Unified issuance to seek financial consolidation and dispel social doubts.</p>

<p>▲ Purely a Courtesy Visit</p>
<p>▲ No Special Mission</p>
<p>Mr. Almirante, the Brazilian Consul General in Shanghai, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government in Fenglin Bridge at 10:00 AM yesterday. Because the Mayor was feeling unwell and had not gone to the Municipal Government, he invited the Consul General to his residence by telephone. They met, with Secretary Tang Shixuan acting as interpreter, and talked for about 20 minutes. The Consul General then thanked the Mayor and left. According to a person in charge of the Municipal Government, the Consul General's visit to the Mayor was purely a courtesy call and there was no special mission. When the Consul General arrived in Shanghai, it happened to coincide with the emergency of the January 28th Incident in Shanghai. At that time, Shanghai was in a state of extreme panic, so the usual courtesy visit was delayed until yesterday when he formally met with the Mayor.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Japanese Person Returning from the United States Discusses American Public Opinion Towards Japan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲ Stimulated by the Manchurian and Shanghai Incidents</p>
<p>The Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News reported that American public opinion towards Japan suddenly changed, triggered by the Shanghai Incident. During the Manchurian Incident, national public opinion was roughly divided into 60% pro-Japanese and 40% anti-Japanese. After the Shanghai Incident, the attitude suddenly changed, becoming 60% anti-Japanese, 20% neutral, and 20% pro-Japanese. Secretary of State Stimson's statements often revealed a threatening tone towards Japan, resulting in an extremely hardened public opinion towards Japan. As a result, rumors circulated that relations between Japan and the United States were in a precarious state. The reason for this was attributed to the stimulation of the American people by Chinese propaganda. Mr. Yamamoto Minezo, who returned from studying in the United States, came to Shanghai to inspect the Shanghai Incident and Chinese politics. He made the following remarks to reporters: Stimson's anti-Japanese remarks created anti-Japanese public opinion among Americans. Some intellectuals, such as professor groups at universities like Washington, Columbia, and Yale, even promoted economic disengagement with a "defeat Japan" doctrine due to the Manchurian Incident. Shortly after, the Shanghai Incident broke out, and the anti-Japanese sentiment expanded, increasingly believing that Japan was invading China. Although American pastors and local news provided explanations, the preconceived Chinese propaganda had already been imprinted in the minds of Americans. (Omission) As for the talk of a Japanese-American war, it was nothing more than what yellow newspapers in the same camp as Japan were promoting. Currently, the major problems in the United States are focused on countermeasures against the Communist Party and the unemployed.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Cotton Yarn Trade Association Held an Emergency Meeting of the Executive Committee Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>▲ Urging Members to Refuse to Buy and Sell Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Yarn Trade Association, due to repeated warnings from the Red Blood Brigade, held an emergency meeting of the Executive Committee at 4:00 PM yesterday. Executive Committee members such as Wen Lanting, Shao Ruisheng, Tang Zhiliang, and Zhou Yusheng attended. After Chairman Wen Lanting reported, the discussion began. The resolutions are summarized as follows: (1) Regarding the case that the association should re-elect half of the executive committee members according to the Chamber of Commerce Law, it was resolved to hold a general meeting of members at 2:00 PM on August 28th for re-election. Seven people will be drawn first, and then seven people will be elected by voting. Members are now notified to fill in the names of the association representatives. According to the Trade Association Law, five supervisory committee members should be added. (2) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce urged practical persuasion of members to sell cotton yarn at fair prices because the national yarn price was raised. It was resolved to reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce that the yarn industry has no right to raise yarn prices. Cotton yarn merchants only receive a very small commission, and the price level depends entirely on the yarn factory. (3) The Red Blood Brigade and various groups warned to continue boycotting inferior goods. It was resolved to forward the original letter to member firms and reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the National Salvation Federation, etc. (4) (Omitted) The meeting adjourned at 5:20 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Case of Chinese Man Arrested by Indian Constable in the Concession: Autopsy Reveals Injuries <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Zhou A-yu (also known as Zhou A-you), a native of Shaoxing, was moving his stall and was stabbed to death and his third son stabbed and injured by Indian constables and others. The perpetrators, Sha- Sha Mengen and Ala Dat, were extradited to the British Consulate. On the morning of the 4th, the case was heard by British Consulate adjudicator Hams. The Public Security Bureau dispatched Qu Sunyi, an assistant from the Third Section, along with patrolman Wang Yan from the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, and Dong Wushi, the second landlord of the deceased Zhou A-yu, and witness Xu Junchuan, as well as blood-stained clothing and other evidence. After the trial, the defendant's lawyer requested that personnel from the Public Works Department be sent to the scene of the incident to investigate in detail and to examine how the deceased died to clarify the truth. The British Consulate issued a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Police, which was hand-delivered to Qu Sunyi, the representative of the Public Security Bureau, for joint examination. Director Wen sent a letter appointing forensic doctor Wei Ligong to conduct a joint examination with British doctor Beiden from the Public Works Department. They went to the Shaoxing Guild Hall in Zhabei at 5:30 PM on the 5th to open the coffin for examination. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau reported on the report from forensic doctor Wei Ligong. The original letter states roughly: "According to your bureau's request, [I] was asked to conduct a joint examination with the Public Works Department doctor at the Shaoxing Guild Hall in Zhabei. [I] immediately went with Doctor Bei, two Chinese and Western detectives from the Huishan Police Station, and two gentlemen from your bureau, Qu and He, to open the coffin for examination. [We] found that Zhou A-yu (also known as Zhou A-you), aged 26, died of injuries on the 2nd of this month and was sent to the Guild Hall after being embalmed on the 3rd. [Examination] found that he was 1.65 meters tall, his clothes were intact, but after undressing, the entire body had begun to decompose. On the left chest, one inch above the left nipple, and two inches to the left of the left nipple, in between the fourth and fifth ribs, there was a horizontal wound about one inch long. The lung protruded from the wound. Because of decomposition, no other wounds were seen on the rest of the body. It was determined that he was stabbed in the left lung and died from the stab wound. Accordingly, [I] am reporting this." It is reported that the Public Security Bureau has solid evidence in the case and is now negotiating with the British Consulate based on the facts. Yesterday, the British Consulate's transmission of witness testimony has not yet ended.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Judgment in Chen Xing's Marital Dispute <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Ordered to Compensate Yan Shufen 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, engaged Miss Yan Shufen, a relative of Yan Dunyuan, the former Minister of Internal Affairs, as his wife when he was not yet successful. He also received repeated cultivation from his wife's family, who subsidized his tuition fees. However, while studying in the United States, Chen suddenly married a woman surnamed Cai, disregarding Miss Yan. After returning to the country and serving in the banking industry, he neither prepared to fulfill the previous marriage contract nor legally dissolved it, leaving Miss Yan alone in an empty boudoir, wasting her youth. Until last year, this old maid was already forty-two years old and could hardly continue to delay. When Chen was honored with the high position of Deputy Governor of the National Bank, she requested that Chen quickly resolve this ill-fated relationship. Because he refused to negotiate, the woman filed a complaint with the First Special District Local Court, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay 100,000 yuan in damages for the loss caused by the delayed fulfillment of the marriage contract. During the trial, the defendant claimed that Yan Shufen had already married Fu Wutui, the nephew of the former Shanghai Daoyin Fu Jiang, in Beiping, so he could no longer marry her. The judge then ruled against the plaintiff. However, Yan Shufen swore that Chen's claims were false. Lawyer Yan Jiangyi filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and described in detail the marital relationship with Fu Wutui, stating that because Chen had delayed fulfilling the marriage contract and repeatedly wanted to dissolve the engagement, the elders of the family arranged a marriage with Fu Jiang's nephew through matchmakers such as Chen and Erren'an. However, she herself was familiar with female virtues and could not marry two husbands. Therefore, when the bridal sedan arrived, she resolutely cut her hair to show her determination. Now, Chen not only failed to understand her feelings but also falsely accused her, so she requested the court to revoke the original judgment and conduct an impartial investigation. She also tried to invite Fu Wutui to Shanghai. After the Second Branch of the High Court summoned him to testify, both lawyers debated in court and yesterday morning, Hu Yigu, the presiding judge of the civil court, along with Han and Ye, the two judges, announced the judgment. The main text read: "The original judgment is revoked. Chen Xing is ordered to compensate Yan Shufen 50,000 yuan. The appellant's remaining requests are rejected. The litigation costs shall be borne equally by both parties."</p>

<p>▲ Zhao Kaicai Intends to Adopt a Son</p>
<p>▲ Song Dalou Unintentionally Meets His Real Parent</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association rescued a child named Song Dalou in June 1931. According to him, he was a native of Tianjin, twelve years old, and was abused by his father. He escaped in the meantime and secretly boarded a transport ship to Shanghai to find his sister. After arriving on shore, he got lost and was almost abducted by villains. He was rescued by the Child Welfare Association and handed over to the Child Welfare Training Institute for education. This year, Zhao Kaicai, a bailiff from the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, a native of Hunan, nearly fifty years old, whose wife died ten years ago, leaving behind a son who was just two years old. He raised him until he was six years old, when he was suddenly abducted by bandits and could not be found despite searching everywhere. Now that he is nearly fifty and has no children, he asked Hu Yigu (also an executive member of the Association), the presiding judge of the civil court, to introduce him to the Training Institute of the Association to adopt an orphan as a son to comfort his loneliness. After the Association investigated and found him qualified, he was allowed to adopt a child. Zhao Kaicai went to the Institute a few days ago to choose and, upon seeing Song Dalou, seemed touched and said, "This child looks very much like my son who was lost six years ago." However, my son has a special birthmark on his back. Please check it in person. He immediately asked the child to take off his clothes to check, and indeed there was a birthmark, which matched what Zhao said. So, this child was Zhao's son who was lost six years ago. How he was abducted to Tianjin and then escaped to Shanghai, was rescued and educated by the Child Welfare Association, and finally allowed the pearl to return to Hepu and the family to reunite, although it was due to a miraculous coincidence, the work of the Child Welfare Association cannot be erased.</p>

<p>▲ West of St. Mary's Hall</p>
<p>▲ Stab Wounds on Left Side of Neck and Chest</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 6th) at around 1:00 PM, a female corpse was suddenly discovered next to the road west of St. Mary's Hall on Route Tenant de Vermale. A passerby saw it and reported it to the Second Branch of the Sixth District Precinct in Zhoujiaqiao, which forwarded the report to the Sixth District Police Department. After receiving the report, the district chief immediately sent Inspector Xu to investigate. It was found that the nameless female corpse was about 50 years old, wearing blue cloth trousers, white gauze socks, and blue cloth shoes, and her hair was styled in a bun, resembling a local woman. There were stab wounds on the left side of her neck and chest, each very deep, with blood flowing profusely. It seemed that she was murdered and her body moved and abandoned here. After completing the investigation, the district chief reported back and ordered Xu Youyuan, the fourth-district bailiff in charge, to report to the local court for an autopsy. The court appointed Inspector Yang to bring a forensic official to the scene for examination. It was found that the deceased had indeed been stabbed to death with a knife while alive. As no family members were found to claim the body, it was ordered to report to the authorities to prepare a coffin and collect the body, pending the arrest and interrogation of the murderer.</p>

It was proposed that the company find a way to transfer mail by plane to counter the interference of the puppet postal service, and considerable results have been achieved. According to Mr. Wang Zhiyuan of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, speaking to a Far Eastern Society reporter, a solution for saving European mail transport has been largely determined. The Shanghai-Xinjiang route is expected to be fully open in mid-October. Once opened, all mail destined for Europe can be transferred by plane to the Northwest and then to Europe, which will easily solve the current difficulties. Currently, in addition to handling the contract signing with the Directorate General of Posts, the company is also conducting consultations with the Soviet Union Aviation Corporation on joint transportation methods, which should not be a major problem.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Xiong Shihui Explains the Reasons for the Special Goods Production and Sales Donation <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>▲ Reply to the Jiangxi Public Association Telegram</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui's reply to the Jiangxi Public Association telegram reads: "To the directors of the Shanghai Jiangxi Public Association, I have read the telegram from Ge Ri, expressing concerns about the recently implemented bandit suppression and rehabilitation donation in Jiangxi Province. Your concern for our homeland is the hallmark of benevolence, and I dare not but express my gratitude. However, Jiangxi is the area most severely affected by the Red scourge. In recent years, villages have been reduced to ruins, people have been displaced, and the Red bandits continue to use their communist heresies to collude with peasants, intoxicate the youth, and implement a predatory land policy. Crisis is looming and threatening to break. In this most difficult and critical period, it is necessary to identify goals, stride forward with a broad vision, and advance military and political affairs simultaneously, with a precise timeline, to achieve a fundamental solution. Quick fixes and temporary measures will not suffice. As the unworthy governor of my homeland, I am deeply concerned and, without overestimating myself, consider the elimination of banditry and the construction of</p>
<p>the region as my inescapable responsibility. Today, the key to governance in Jiangxi must be to strengthen our self-defense forces to prevent the attacks and movements of the Red bandits, avoid attacking the strong and attacking the weak, and prevent them from using the countryside as a base. It is also necessary to thoroughly measure land, reorganize land taxes, determine tenancy rights, and improve land rents, to destroy their poisonous plot of plundering and deceiving the peasants. Furthermore, establishing a security system to clarify household registration and repairing roads to facilitate transportation are also urgent measures. Jiangxi Province has always been known for its poverty, and the central government's assistance has been suspended since last December, resulting in a monthly reduction of 125,000 yuan. The tax revenue collected by various counties averages no more than 50%, and other miscellaneous income is also limited. The provincial treasury is so strained, and yet so many government affairs are waiting to be addressed. If you were in my position, what would you do? Last year, when Generalissimo Chiang came to Jiangxi to oversee the military operations, the enormous military expenditures were borne by the national treasury. Even the expenses required for the political anti-banditry work of the party-government committees and their subordinate district branches were covered by allocations from the headquarters. The local government could reduce this burden. However, the situation is different now. How can we rely on the national treasury for subsidies? Moreover, the relief funds were raised by me at sea. Providing disaster relief and comforting the afflicted is an ancient virtue. However, I have never heard of raising funds for political projects. The financial circulation of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces still allows for borrowing, which is not feasible in Jiangxi, where industry and commerce are in decline. The only way to raise funds is through taxation, and taxes are of three types: land tax, salt tax, and goods tax. Jiangxi's rural economy has long been bankrupt, and peasants are abandoning cultivation. We are preoccupied with providing relief and cannot afford to increase land taxes or impose excessive levies. Therefore, the only way to address the land tax is to strive to reorganize it, eliminate corruption, and then carry out measurement and determine land taxes to increase revenue. This has already begun in Nanchang, Xinjian, and Jinxian counties. The salt tax is a national tax. This spring, an additional surcharge of 1.5 yuan was added, which is expected to generate over 1.3 million yuan annually. Since its implementation, it has been relatively smooth. The tax revenue has been designated for road construction. The current bandit suppression and rehabilitation donation is the so-called goods tax. At the beginning of its implementation, we consulted widely and sought advice from many sources. All names, tax items, and collection methods were carefully considered to ensure the best possible outcome. Once the donation is paid, it is valid throughout the province, unlike the previous likin taxes, which involved setting up checkpoints at every stage. It cannot be considered harsh. It is only levied on a few major production and sales items, so it cannot be considered miscellaneous. Some commentators compare the abolition of likin with the imposition of donations. It should be understood that there is no absolute good or evil in politics, nor is there absolute right or wrong. It is about weighing the advantages and disadvantages and adapting to the times and circumstances. Today, what Jiangxi people are suffering from is the Communist bandits. They are worried day and night, and they cannot sleep or eat in peace. If bearing this donation enables the government to implement measures and achieve the goal of living and working in peace, I ask, will the people be happy to donate, or will they prefer to fold their hands and await slaughter by the Communist bandits? Therefore, the right and wrong, good and evil, of politics depend on the motive behind it. As for the benevolence of nurturing and the righteousness of loving one's children, I have doubts. The National Government's abolition of likin last year was indeed a good policy, but Hu Yongzhi's implementation of likin in the past was also not without its merits. If the Qing court had abolished likin as soon as the military suppression was completed in the early years of Tongzhi, it would only have seen its benefits and not its harms. When Hu was appointed governor of Hubei, Wuchang had just fallen, and the damage had not yet been repaired. He followed the example of Yangzhou and levied likin on merchants' goods, trying to equalize donations. Even the smallest items were contested. He took money from the merchants in Hankou and from the county property taxes to support the military expenses. At the same time, he requested the exemption of land taxes in 46 prefectures and counties, including Jiangxia, to relieve the people's hardship. The following year, he requested the reorganization of the grain tribute, reducing surcharges and eliminating redundant expenses, completely reforming the centuries-old malpractice. During the period of bandit suppression, the first priority is to protect farmers and facilitate commerce. In Jiangxi's recent experience, although we benefited from the abolition of likin last year, the situation of industry and commerce did not improve, but rather declined daily. This is because the bandit atmosphere is not quelled, and transportation has not been restored. Although taxes and likin have been reduced, their effect is minimal. Moreover, this production and sales donation was approved by the bandit suppression conference. The representatives of the conference were elected by the public law groups of various counties, who understood the local situation and believed that without bandit suppression, there could be no industry and commerce. They resolutely approved it and considered it feasible. I was still afraid of repeating the mistake of likin, which was established and never abolished. To prevent problems before they arise, I changed the name of the production and sales tax in the original proposal of the Finance Department to "Special Goods Production and Sales Bandit Suppression and Rehabilitation Donation," which is entirely based on Jiangxi's special circumstances, using the local people's donations to address local urgent needs. This is the humble effort of me and my colleagues that I hope you will understand. The estimated annual revenue from the production and sales donation is only over two million yuan, most of which must be used for bandit suppression and rehabilitation needs. The amount that can be used to increase the security guard teams is only over 900,000 yuan, which is far from the expected amount. It can be seen that it cannot be used exclusively to increase eight regimental units. However, considering the current situation in Jiangxi, if we can add these eight regiments, it may not be a misfortune for the region. Given the current financial difficulties, I dare not hope for its realization. Therefore, the budget for the 21st year only allocates 930,000 yuan as the minimum increase. I ask myself, my heart is clear and I am not ashamed before heaven and earth. You are far away on the coast, and you may not be familiar with the true situation in your homeland. You may be misled by one or two merchants who do not understand the overall situation and spread rumors, resulting in accusations. I have no choice but to lay bare my heart and analyze the advantages and disadvantages before you. I came here solely for the sake of saving Jiangxi. I am willing to go through fire and water for anything that benefits the region. I have never cared about right or wrong, praise or slander. It is easy to please those who are good in the homeland, but difficult to avoid the dislike of those who are not. As for the accusation that I am expanding the teams for ulterior motives, although I am unworthy, I have led tens of thousands of troops to quell the chaos. If I were to insist on owning several regimental units to establish my chieftain's and chieftain's power, then what could move my heart? In the past, Hu Yongzhi's memorial requesting the reorganization of the grain tribute stated, "If it benefits the country, if it benefits the people, then I will not hesitate to sing the song of slaughter." Those who do good are the happiest, and only those who are selfless are strong. It is easy to talk about things in the world, but difficult to do them. It takes a hundred years to build, but one word can destroy it. You are all elders of your homeland, respected by all. I hope you will understand the difficulties of the times and work together in the same boat. Jiangxi's troubles are deep, and Jiangxi's people are suffering. Today's affairs, even if the entire Jiangxi people work together, it is still difficult to hope for success. How can we create side issues and cause further disputes? I believe that those who love their homeland would not do this. I hope you will consider and understand. Jiangxi will be fortunate. Xiong Shihui, winter seal."</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Two National Goods Associations Request Negotiations Regarding the A.P. Earle Light Bulb Case <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association and the China National Goods Maintenance Association's member, A.P. Earle Electrical Factory's light bulbs, were sued by the Philips Company in the Batavia court. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the two national goods associations sent a telegram to Consul Song in Java, requesting the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Java to argue based on reason. Telegrams were sent to the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan of the National Government, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting serious negotiations. They also sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Overseas Chinese Federation, and other organizations, requesting them to assist in safeguarding national rights and maintaining national goods. The original telegram reads: (Headings omitted) "According to a letter from our member, A.P. Earle Electrical Factory, our factory's various types of light bulbs have been sold both domestically and internationally for many years, especially in Southeast Asia. This has caused jealousy among the colonial powers. In February of this year, the Dutch Philips Light Bulb Company, claiming that the "haff bubble" (i.e., argon bubble) was invented by their company and enjoys a patent, prohibited the Dutch East Indies General Agency Batavia Youth Trading Company from selling our factory's haff bubbles. We had to stop selling under duress. Unexpectedly, the Philips Company was not satisfied and wanted to completely defeat all brands of light bulbs on the market to implement a monopoly plan. Seeing that the style and quality of our factory's light bulbs were comparable to their products, they deliberately wanted to defeat us first, claiming that the method of using glass tubes to extract air from the light bulbs was also their invention and infringed on their patent rights. They sued us in the local court, demanding compensation. The Youth Company, which was selling the goods, had to pay local tariffs when the goods arrived, so they returned the original 23 boxes of our factory's newly shipped light bulbs. At the same time, they hired famous lawyers to defend us when the time comes. The method of extracting air from glass tubes is commonly used in various light bulbs today. We have never heard that it was invented and patented by Philips. Now, they are fabricating excuses to crack down on us and implement a monopoly. It is nothing more than bullying our country for being weak and unable to protect overseas Chinese, arbitrarily slaughtering us, and infringing on our commerce. Accordingly, we request that you provide relief and protect overseas trade, etc." After the meeting, it was found that the glass tube air extraction method is a necessary procedure for manufacturing light bulbs. The Philips Company is jealous of the wide sales of A.P. Earle light bulbs and regards them as a strong enemy. They are using the excuse of patents to deliberately defeat us, sparing no effort to destroy and invade us. If this precedent is set, the loss of part of the factory's business is a small matter, but the future of national goods in overseas trade is no small matter. Moreover, our country's science is backward, and the production of national goods is mostly based on imitation of foreign machines. Southeast Asia is the base area for our country's national goods to be sold overseas. It poses a great danger to overseas Chinese merchants who promote national goods. Our association advocates national goods and promotes trade. We cannot remain silent. In addition to telegraphing the Consul General in Java and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Java to argue based on reason and provide assistance, we specially request that you safeguard national goods in overseas trade, protect overseas Chinese merchants, and promote national goods. Please conduct serious negotiations as soon as possible to safeguard national rights and maintain national goods. (Omissions below) Wang Jie'an, Wang Hanqiang, and Wang Xingyi, Standing Committee Members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association; Yu Hede, Feng Shaoshan, Chen Yiting, Chen Binghui, Fang Jiange, Xu Jianruo, and Zhang Dezhai, Standing Committee Members of the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, respectfully kowtow, fish seal.</p>

<p>Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, transportation between Beijing and Shanghai has become increasingly busy. In the event of urgent incidents, it is extremely inconvenient to rely solely on wired long-distance telephones. Yu Ruxin, director of the Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Factory of the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate rapid transportation between Beijing and Shanghai, is preparing to establish a wireless telephone direct to Nanjing. According to Yu, speaking to a reporter from the East China News Agency, the entire plan had been drafted in advance. The factory will manufacture two radio stations themselves, which will cost approximately 30,000 yuan. The Shanghai station will be set up in Zhenru, with an antenna reaching the Sassoon Building radio station. The approval order from the Ministry was received some time ago, and work is currently underway and will begin soon.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Anti-Opium Society Advocates Thorough Investigation of the Military Counselor's Office Smuggling Case <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The China National Anti-Opium Society believes that the discovery of the Military Counselor's Office smuggling soil has caused a public outcry and has had a significant impact on the future of opium prohibition. It has sent a letter to Chairman Lin of the National Government, advocating a thorough investigation. The original letter is transcribed below: [Dear Sir, According to recent reports in the Beijing-Shanghai newspapers, at the Nanjing Xiaguan Railway Station, military police uncovered five large boxes of smuggled opium soil being privately transported by Section Chief Xiao of the Military Counselor's Office of the National Government, all affixed with seals from the Military Counselor's Office of the National Government. After the incident was discovered, he claimed that it belonged to Military Counselor Lu Chao and that he was not responsible. This is extremely shocking. Smuggling opium soil is a violation of criminal law. The Military Counselor's Office is a high-level agency of the National Government, and the Military Counselor is a senior military and political official. They are entrusted with the dignity of the government and the attention of the international community. How can they disregard national law, violate criminal law, and compete with opium dealers for petty profits, disgracing the national image? There is nothing worse than this. It is heard that after the incident, Lu claimed that it was done by his subordinates and that he was not responsible. In the past, in many cases of important figures transporting soil, they all pushed the blame onto their subordinates. For example, in the Jiang'an transport ship opium smuggling case of the previous year, everyone knew the background, and the result was also to push the blame onto the subordinates, letting them off lightly. The important figures who instigated and escorted the smuggling were able to escape punishment. Finally, there was an even more unexpected outcome: those who sheltered the opium smugglers were promoted, while those who investigated the opium smugglers were dismissed. Public justice and national law were completely destroyed. This is deeply regrettable. This time, the Military Counselor's Office is again smuggling soil and claiming that it was done by subordinates. How can the story be exactly the same? Moreover, Chinese soldiers transporting soil has become a commonplace fact, such as warships escorting and airplanes transporting. There are countless examples. Therefore, the Military Counselor's Office privately transporting opium is truly impossible for people not to suspect. However, in the past, most of the cases involved local soldiers. Now, even the central senior agency, the Military Counselor's Office, is known for transporting soil. The magnitude of the matter and the importance of the relationship cannot be compared. Moreover, the occurrence of this case comes immediately after the central government reiterated the opium prohibition. The senior officials of the Military Counselor's Office knowingly violated the law and took the lead. It is truly unknown what they were thinking. Furthermore, the case of Gao Ying and his wife, the former deputy consul in San Francisco, smuggling opium soil, was dealt with severely by the authorities due to diplomatic relations. Even without diplomatic relations, the Military Counselor's Office transporting soil has sullied the international community and made us a laughingstock to the world. It is even more serious than the Gao case and should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with severely in order to maintain credibility and emphasize prohibition. I respectfully request that Your Excellency uphold impartiality, break through personal considerations, and investigate and handle the case according to law. Do not let one person be spared at the expense of a hundred, allowing the national administration to become increasingly corrupt and the trend of opium smuggling to never end. The party and the country will be fortunate, and the opium prohibition will be fortunate."]</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has been registering foreign rice and foreign wheat for more than a year. During the Shanghai War this year, many rice shops in Zhabei moved to the concessions. This registration was briefly suspended, but it was resumed in April. The bureau has repeatedly ordered various shops to comply with the reporting requirements. Therefore, the number of registered items is quite large. It is now known that the registration for July has been completed. A total of 8,000 bags of foreign rice were registered for order, 520,500 bags of foreign rice were registered for arrival, and 174,950 tons of foreign wheat were registered for arrival. Some rice shops, such as Yuantai and Wanshengxing, have not yet reported their arrival. The bureau has instructed the Rice Industry Association to instruct these shops to report by the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Current Situation of Zhabei Porridge Distribution <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>▲ 1,680 registered numbers</p>
<p>▲ More than 3.5 dan of rice needed daily for porridge distribution</p>
<p>Wu Xingya, director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, previously inspected the war zone and was extremely indignant at the devastation. He was especially saddened by the fact that most of Zhabei had been completely destroyed, leaving a scorched earth. He believed that after the war, most of the poor people had lost their homes and could not afford to eat. He immediately instructed the relevant departments to coordinate the reconstruction plan and paid special attention to the relief of the poor. He ordered Zhang Binghui, chief of the fourth section of the bureau, to formulate a porridge distribution plan. Zhang, citing the current municipal treasury expenditure, was unable to request funds. He submitted a request to the municipal government to allocate 3,000 yuan from the temporary relief fund and handed it over to Wang Binyan, director of the Zhabei Charity Association, to organize porridge distribution in the Liulu area. It officially opened on the 2nd of this month, distributing porridge every day from 5:00 AM to 7:00 AM. The director, to prevent abuse, notified the general public in advance that they must first register and receive a ticket before they could receive porridge. On the first day, there were more than 600 people. On the second and third days, there were more than 800 people. By the 4th, a total of 1,680 numbers had been registered.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Although the deadline has passed, the amount of rice needed for porridge distribution every day is more than 3 dan and 5 dou. Those who did not register temporarily were also given leniency, and their formalities were waived. The weather is becoming cooler with the approach of autumn, and rain is expected soon. The porridge distribution shelter is inadequate and urgently needs to be expanded with reed mats, totaling more than 40 square meters in two places. Each square meter costs 5 yuan and 2 jiao, totaling more than 200 yuan, to prevent wind and rain. The matter has been submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. The Social Affairs Bureau will send personnel to investigate and then approve the allocation. The bureau has also assigned staff members Cui Cong and Zhu Yulin to be responsible for inspecting everything at Liulu Road at any time.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Hygiene and Experiment Station at 198 Guangdong Road, Zhabei, became even busier after the Central Hygiene and Experiment Station moved to Nanjing after the Shanghai War. Moreover, various infectious diseases are prevalent in the city this summer, and many doctors have requested to test the causes of various infectious diseases. Cheng Xiezhen, the director of the station, hosted the press at the station yesterday (the 6th) at 2:00 PM. More than a dozen Chinese and foreign reporters from newspapers and news agencies attended. Director Cheng and staff member Cao Yunsheng led them on a tour and provided explanations.

<h3 id="e131">Taxi Industry Association Advocates Exploitation of Our Country's Oil Mines <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>▲ Increase National Defense for the Country</p>
<p>▲ Seek Benefits for Colleagues</p>
<p>The Shanghai Taxi Industry Association, after its 29th executive committee meeting, decided to seek the opinions of all colleagues regarding the exploitation of oil mines. Yesterday, the association sent a special letter to its colleagues, stating: "Dear Sir, In our letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on June 20th regarding the promotion of national goods and the establishment of industry, we failed to mention the exploitation of oil mines, which is a regrettable omission. It is believed that the main reason why the Japanese are actively plotting to take over the Northeast is that they want to obtain an oil-producing area. They fear that if a second world war breaks out and the sea routes are inevitably blockaded, the supply of gasoline will be cut off because the three islands do not have such production. Therefore, even if they have a large number of aircraft, it will be as if they do not have them. Therefore, the tighter the situation among the great powers, the more urgently the Japanese are plotting. It is found that our country has oil-producing areas in Jilin in the Northeast, Shanxi and Shaanxi in the Northwest, and Sichuan and Guangxi in the Southwest. If we want to defend against foreign insults and develop transportation, then advocating the exploitation of oil mines is an urgent task. For this reason, we request that your association forward this to the Ministry of Industry and request that it promulgate protection regulations, and send technicians and mining engineers to visit various places. At the same time, we request the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce to send inquiries to the local municipal chambers of commerce for detailed investigation, and solicit reports from local residents, so that they can be collected and considered before planning the capital and engaging in separate exploitation, which is an important item for the country's defense equipment, and a lifeline for our industry's daily consumption. It will benefit both the country and the merchants. We propose our humble opinions and request that they be adopted and implemented." After this was sent, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied that it had telegraphed the Ministry of Industry regarding the exploitation of oil mines, requesting that it be reviewed and implemented. Now, we have received approval document Mining Character No. 5804, stating that the exploitation of oil mines is an important political affair, and the Ministry had previously proposed to start exploiting the Shaanxi oil mines first, and has already planned and estimated the costs, which has been presented to the Central Political Conference and approved on record. However, due to lack of funds, it has not yet been implemented. The association is concerned about the oil mine industry, and its views are exactly the same as those of the Ministry. If the association can assist in the process, it will definitely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Please collect opinions and propose a method of raising large sums of money as soon as possible, and submit them for review. According to this, we have learned that our industry's daily consumption of gasoline has not been exploited in our country, and relies on the supply of imported goods, which are manipulated by foreign merchants, who arbitrarily raise and lower prices and do whatever they want. Their business competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and the rent is even more difficult to increase sharply. Once gasoline prices soar, we will inevitably be stuck waiting for death. Whenever we think of this, we feel chills down our spines. In order to prevent this from happening, this association is advocating the exploitation of oil mines in the country, which will increase national defense for the country and seek benefits for colleagues. There is nothing better than this. Fortunately, the Ministry of Industry's approval has been issued, but the plan for raising funds has not yet been achieved. It is believed that it is difficult to achieve success alone, but it is easy to lift with everyone. Therefore, we are specially requesting the assistance of the Automobile Industry Association and the Rubber Hardware and Auto Parts Industry Association, and corresponding inquiries are made to solicit the opinions of our colleagues and investment methods, so that we can collect and consider them comprehensively, collect and review them, and then report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and forward them to the Ministry of Industry for implementation. It is believed that this matter is closely related to the interests of our colleagues, and we trust that you will agree. Please investigate and reply as soon as possible. We wish you all the best.

<p>▲ Dispute at the Welcoming of President Wang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Journalists Association received a letter yesterday from members Xu Shen and Wu Dong, which read: "To Whom It May Concern, President of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei arrived in Shanghai by special train. Members Xu Shen and others learned that the special train departed from Nanjing at approximately 9:00 PM on the 5th, and would arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 6th. Xu Shen and others rushed to the North Railway Station and Zhenru Station around 2:30 AM to inquire. They learned that the special train would stop beside the freight station behind the Meigen Road freight station. Xu Shen and others drove there, arriving close to 5:00 AM. Soon after, Chen Xinghan, the two-route bureau chief, also arrived and loudly interrogated Xu Shen and others. Shen immediately responded that they were journalists, not idlers. Chen then questioned how they knew President Wang was arriving in Shanghai, and ordered the railway police to use force to expel them. Xu Shen and others were about to explain everything to Chen when they were stopped by the railway police captain, who ordered them to leave. Shen and others, having reached their limit of tolerance, still explained everything politely, stating that interviewing was a journalist's freedom, and unless they were committing illegal acts, they should not be subjected to unreasonable expulsion and shouting. Chen became even angrier and took his anger out on the police officers, ordering them to ensure that the car Xu Shen and others were in was driven away and not allowed to park at the station. It was found that the place was next to the road, but it was a public road for people to travel on. How could he interfere arbitrarily? This was clearly an abuse of authority. However, Xu Shen and others, to avoid complications, still tolerated it and ordered the driver to drive the car away and wait. Later, Chen left on a locomotive, and drove the President's car to Zhenru. Xu Shen and others, due to their duty to investigate the news, had Wu Dong wait at the original station, while Xu Shen took a car back to Zhenru. Unexpectedly, Chen still did not understand in Zhenru and continued to order the railway police to block Xu Shen from entering the station and arbitrarily insulted him. These barbaric actions disregard the personality of reporters. To protect the dignity of all reporters and to facilitate future work, Xu Shen has written this letter to inform you of the situation and hopes that you will seriously negotiate with the bureau chief to ensure that the above-mentioned matters do not happen again."</p>

Its shareholders such as Sun Zhiqi, Wang Xianchen, Li Yucheng, Wang Zihou, Hu Xisheng, and Rong Hongsan are all prominent figures in the financial world. Now they, like Qianzhuang, bear unlimited liability for handling savings, which opens a new era in Shanghai. It is also heard that in terms of business, they only do various reliable mortgages and absolutely do not provide current account loans, which is especially stable and reliable. Therefore, although it is only the beginning of the opening, the number of people who go to save is already very high.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Animal Husbandry Expert He Liyuan Returns to China <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲ Bringing Twenty Milk Cows</p>
<p>Animal husbandry expert Dr. He Liyuan has lived in the Americas for twenty-six years. He has profound research and experience in animal husbandry, especially in raising cattle. Recently, he has realized that his motherland needs to develop industry to enrich people's lives. He specially selected twenty of the purest breeds of milk cows from the Americas and transported them back to China to start improving the rural economy. Dr. He is from Xinhui, Guangdong. He studied in the Americas in his early years, and then engaged in business in the United States, engaged in the cattle raising industry, for a total of twenty-six years. He lived in Kansas City in the central United States and slightly placed real estate. He collected the best American breeds of cattle on his own farm for practical experiments, and the results were excellent. His deeds have been repeatedly published in American animal husbandry magazines, and he has won the reputation of an American cattle breeder. Therefore, people from all countries in the United States know Dr. He. His being elected as a member of the North American Society of Animal Science is also for this reason. This is the first Chinese person to join the association, and he has won a lot of glory for the country. Dr. He returned to China three months ago. At that time, Shanghai had just experienced war and order had not been restored, so he specially transported his cattle to Hong Kong for temporary residence to avoid danger. Now that Shanghai has gradually calmed down, he has transported the cattle to Shanghai a few days ago and plans to live there for a long time. He is currently surveying locations and contacting personnel to prepare for the construction of a cattle farm. Dr. He's resolute return to China with cattle this time is purely driven by patriotism. He deeply feels that living overseas for a long time contributes little to the motherland, and he should do more production work for the motherland in the future. His friends in Shanghai, such as Chuan Ruoyu, Wu Wenwei, Tang Wenti, Li Jin, and Cheng Shao, admire his ambition and believe that his work is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, and are willing to do their best to help him succeed.</p>

It was decided to petition the Social Bureau on the one hand, and to plan countermeasures on the other hand.

Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was reported to dispatch Prosecutor Guo Wei, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., to the station to examine the body. The autopsy was publicly opened. Yuan Rongquan reported that the deceased and I were both workers in the factory. At that time, he was injured by the bursting grinding stone, which I saw later. The grinding stone was made of four pieces of glue. It was rotating all day long. The deceased rubbed the steel plate that day, but the stone had been used for a long time, causing it to suddenly burst. The deceased's brother Yang Zhaolong reported that I did not see it at the time and requested the factory to give compensation. Mr. Guo obtained the confession and then announced that the deceased Yang Renlong had indeed died from his injuries before his death. The body was handed over to the deceased's brother Yang Zhaolong to sign a guarantee to take back the coffin for burial.</p>

<p>Xu Yonglin, a native of Haimen, an 18-year-old apprentice at the Ri Xin Laundry Company at No. 2136 Peng Road, has been working at the company for three months. In the past, his conduct was not bad, but Xu suddenly got up from his bed at about 3 AM on the 2nd of this month, and poured a cup of gasoline on the paper box of clothes entrusted to the customer for washing in the store hall to set fire. His colleague apprentice Shen Gensen noticed it and worked with the boss, Chen Gaofeng from Ningbo, to put out the fire. Xu Yonglin was arrested by the Hongkou Police Station and sent to the First Special District Court. He confessed that he was haunted by nightmares and caused the disaster, seeking forgiveness. The interrogator ordered him to be detained for sentencing. As has been recorded in this newspaper, yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong came to court and sentenced Xu Yonglin to one year of imprisonment with two years of probation for arson and destruction of other people's property.

<p>The second-hand industry in Shanghai sells broken clothes, scrap steel, and iron. Therefore, people mostly ignore it. Now, a large merchant in Shanghai, seeing this and adhering to his reform spirit, also wants to raise eyebrows for the second-hand industry and improve its status. He has specially collected huge sums of money to set up a Shanghai Second-Hand Store at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road (formerly the site of the Municipal Government). As the name suggests, it seems similar to the second-hand shops in Beijing Road, but it is actually different. Although the store name is "Second-Hand," the items that have expired and been confiscated are of all sizes, and the quality is excellent, the price is low. Therefore, it is expected that the opening day will cause a sensation far and near, and people will rush to buy them. It is bound to be crowded.</p>

These three kinds of biscuits have a very suitable color, aroma, and taste, and the selling price is also the most expensive. Therefore, during the discount period, buyers take into account the difficulty of getting the opportunity at ordinary times, so it is more prosperous.</p>

<p>The White Goose Painting Research Institute, formerly located on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai, was founded by famous artists Chen Qiucao, Fang Xuegu, and Du Xuegu, Pan Sitong, etc. It has existed for many years and has long been praised by people in society.

As a result, existing researchers who wanted to continue their studies and those who aspired to art and wanted to join such a group lacked suitable places. The founders, seeing this, gathered teachers and students staying in Shanghai a few days ago and held a tea party at Guanshengyuan. More than 50 people attended the meeting.</p>
<p>It was decided to organize the 1932 Painting Studio to continue research. The address is temporarily set at M12 Xiangkang Li, Meibike Road. Research has already begun yesterday, divided into day and night departments, with complete equipment and low fees. It is now heard that new members will be recruited.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Wine and Tea House Industry Association sent a letter to the Special District Stamp Tax Bureau, which reads: "To Whom It May Concern, according to a statement from our member, the Fairness Bureau First Floor Restaurant on Tangshan Road, Hongkou, on the morning of the 2nd of this month, the bailiffs came to the store and took away nine account books and draft books placed in our restaurant. At that time, it was said that failure to affix stamp tax violated the rules, etc. After investigation, the vouchers used by our store all have stamp tax affixed to the first page of the account books, and there is no intentional omission in violation of the regulations. However, although the vouchers are affixed for the 20th year, according to business customs, the account books and vouchers have not been used up, and they should continue to be valid for use in the following year. According to the regulations, one cent is affixed to each book. If it is affixed again, it will cause merchants to suffer intangible losses. Please send a letter to negotiate for the return, etc. After investigation, the penalty for failing to affix stamp tax should be based on those who do not affix it as negligence. Since the stamp tax has been affixed, the vouchers cannot be taken away and penalized for no reason. Therefore, this letter requests your bureau to quickly return the nine account books and vouchers of Gongping Yi Lou to avoid losses and maintain the hardship of business. It is reasonable to inform you and hope you will investigate and reply. (Omitted below)"</p>

<h3 id="e155">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Esteemed Mr. Sheng Bi,</p>
<p>With deepest respects, we begin this letter. Our group, realizing the daily urgency of the national crisis and finding no way to die for our cause, has formed the "Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Group." We hope to awaken the deadened hearts of the people through the sacrifice of our blood and souls. On one hand, we aim to reduce the enemy's power of aggression by severing their economic lifelines. On the other hand, with pure patriotic aspirations, we strive for international peace. The Japanese ambition to violate treaties and invade the Northeast is largely due to the profits provided by our people's years of buying and selling Japanese goods. Therefore, those who remain unenlightened and continue to buy and sell Japanese goods today have committed the crime of harming the Republic by aiding foreign enemies against the nation and bear the responsibility of indirectly undermining international treaties. Hence, our group is issuing warnings to such individuals, hoping they will reform. Yesterday, while our member, Yun Huifang, was issuing a warning to the Maochang Foreign Goods Store, she was arrested by the police. Our comrades are determined to face any legal consequences with the spirit of "death before dishonor," but that is not what we fear. However, we believe it necessary to examine whether warning people to change their ways out of love for the nation and to uphold international peace constitutes a crime and what kind of legal punishment should be applied. We respectfully request that you publish this letter in your esteemed newspaper and initiate a "Legal Research Society for Exterminating Traitors," so that various public organizations and individuals who sympathize with our group can fully express their opinions. This will allow for a fair assessment of whether our members' actions constitute a crime and whether they should be subject to legal punishment. In addition to expressing our legal views separately at a later date, we send this letter in advance, wishing you well.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Group</p>
<p>August 6th</p>
<p>With deepest respects, we begin this letter. The organization of our group is purely composed of patriots whose sole purpose is to eliminate traitorous merchants and boycott enemy goods, without any other intentions. Now, to prevent others from impersonating us, we have specially carved a small rubber stamp (image below) since engraving a seal is inconvenient,</p>
<p>to distinguish us. Henceforth, all letters issued by our group will have this blue-inked stamp below the signature as a mark.</p>
<p>Any letters without this same stamp are clearly impersonations and have no connection to our group, for which we bear no responsibility. We hope that all sectors will pay attention. We respectfully submit this to the editor of the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Red Blood Eliminate Traitors Group</p>
<p>August 6th, the twenty-first year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>Esteemed Mr. Editor of the Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of our Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Group leaving a bullet at your newspaper today, we respectfully present a brief outline of the events. Since late July, our store has received letters from both the Youth Iron Blood Group and the Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Group. Yesterday morning, a youth came and delivered a hand grenade, followed by a letter from the Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Group, warning us not to sell enemy goods and demanding that we publish a statement in the newspaper. All of us in this store share the patriotic heart of the Yanhuang people; how could we lag behind others? Although we unfortunately deal in cotton cloth, it was placed in the Anti-Japanese Association for safekeeping and only returned to us in April of this year. Our store, with its capital invested in this stock, has sold it gradually to alleviate our financial difficulties. We dare not be so heartless and insane as to import enemy goods on a large scale and resell them. The members of the Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Group are all patriotic youths. We are sincerely gratified by their act of delivering a bullet as a warning. We deeply believe in the thoroughness of the Blood Soul Exterminate Traitors Group's organization. They even left a bullet as a warning regarding the sale of enemy goods purchased before September 18th, which had been sealed. They will certainly not easily forgive those who actually sell enemy goods. To ensure that enemy goods disappear, our store wishes to declare to all sectors with the utmost sincerity and blood-filled resolve that, even if it leads to closing our doors, we will never sell enemy goods again. With the national crisis becoming more urgent every day, our nation's last hope lies in the undying patriotism of the people. The colleagues at our store are willing to heed the warning of the Blood Soul Group and lay bare our hearts. We hope you will investigate and include this in the "Letters to the Editor" column. We wish you peace.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Colleagues of Yongyu Cloth Store</p>
<p>August 6th</p>
<p>With deepest respects, we begin this letter. Having read today's (August 6th) local news section of your esteemed newspaper, there is a news item titled "(National Salvation Ten-Person Group Joint Association Warns Three Ice and Seafood Shops in Nanshi)." It mentions that the association, based on secret reports, claims that our shop is selling fresh fish transported by Japanese ships. We are extremely surprised to read this. Since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai on January 28th, our shop has severed all ties with Japanese merchants and has implemented an economic boycott.</p>
<p>We have never sold fresh fish transported by Japanese ships. The facts are clear and can be investigated. This matter concerns the reputation of our shop, and we sincerely fear misunderstandings from all sectors. In addition to publishing a statement in the newspaper, we are writing this letter to request that your esteemed editor provide a correction and disclose this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column, so that everyone is aware and any misunderstandings are cleared up. We would be extremely grateful. We respectfully submit this to the esteemed chief editor of the Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e157">How Should Students Utilize Summer Vacation? (II) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>By Wang Xiaoying</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Character</p>
<p>(1) Traveling to famous mountains and rivers, cultivating a broad-minded spirit, shedding narrow local views, or other feudal sectarian views.</p>
<p>(2) Reading biographies and autobiographies of great inventors and all scholars, cultivating habits of hard work, perseverance, and a deep love for learning.</p>
<p>(3) Understanding the suffering of the people, developing a desire to improve society, and rejecting selfish desires.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Willpower</p>
<p>(1) Recognizing the suffering of the entire nation under oppression, thus strengthening the determination to oppose imperialism.</p>
<p>(2) Reading biographies of great revolutionaries in the world, cultivating a spirit of self-sacrifice for the benefit of society.</p>
<p>C. Physical Training</p>
<p>Our people have always been ridiculed by foreigners as the "sick men of East Asia," and we are in a position of a weak nation, suffering the trampling of imperialism. The current situation is becoming increasingly dangerous. We must train our bodies so that we have the strength to defend ourselves and eventually become strong.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Recreation</p>
<p>Such as the organization and competition of ball teams, practice of martial arts, practice and competition of swimming and boating, etc.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Labor</p>
<p>Such as learning military training, hiking, participating in various family and social labor, etc.</p>
<p>D. Promoting Culture</p>
<p>The decline of rural culture is also a cause of national turmoil. Students are supported by society to study, and they should serve society as much as possible. If we wait until graduation to approach society, it will be a major mistake. We should strive to approach society on a regular basis so we can be students of society, not just living books or dictionaries.</p>
<p>The term "culture" encompasses a broad range, including customs, habits, religion, writing, etc. Our promotion should be divided into two aspects: propaganda and implementation. There is an inseparable connection between the two.</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Propaganda</p>
<p>Such as lectures on international situations and the Northeast issue, or personal conversations; suggestions on improving crops and irrigation methods, disaster prevention equipment, and eliminating pests; warnings about preventing epidemics; advocating afforestation, raising chickens, and raising carp in rice paddies; vigorously promoting literacy campaigns; breaking superstitions and bad habits, such as early marriage, drowning of female infants, clan fights, frivolous lawsuits, etc.; emphasizing public health, etc.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Implementation</p>
<p>Such as the organization of sports associations, summer tutoring schools, mobile libraries, open-air schools, etc.; the establishment of temporary epidemic hospitals, catching and reducing pests, encouraging the implementation of public health, etc.</p>
<p>The above outlines are only general suggestions for what should be done. Students include elementary school students and university students, with vastly different abilities and knowledge. Therefore, each person should choose what they can do, first make a plan. Two points should be noted when creating a plan:</p>
<p>(1) Some parts of the plan must be done together with nearby classmates or local people. That part needs to be discussed with everyone, or after a meeting, and then the work you are responsible for should be added to your personal plan.</p>
<p>(2) The plan should not only specify what you should do, but also pay attention to the allocation of time. For example, use four-tenths of the time for academic research, two-tenths of the time for physical and mental cultivation, two-tenths of the time for physical training, and two-tenths of the time for cultural promotion.</p>
<p>(3) The plan should be comprehensively calculated, and the extent to which it can be done should be estimated. However, facts are difficult to predict. In the process of implementing the plan, unexpected resistance may be encountered. Therefore, two kinds of limits should be set for the plan, one is the highest limit, and one is the lowest limit.</p>
<p>(4) After the plan is implemented, there should be a report of the results to prove that the plan is not empty talk on paper. (End)</p>

<p>▲Election of Chen Yuguang and Eight Others as Directors</p>
<p>The convened chemistry discussion meeting was completed on the morning of the 5th. Taking this opportunity, 50 members attending the meeting initiated the organization of the Chinese Chemical Society. The main purpose of the initiative is that the study of chemistry in China has lacked a nationwide organization. For the sake of chemical research for the Chinese nation and for the sake of national defense chemistry, a nationwide organization is imperative. Therefore, the founding meeting was held in the morning at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center. Chen Yuguang and eight others (professors from universities in Beijing, Shanghai, and Beiping were nominated for ease of meeting) were elected as directors. Huang Xinyan and Ge Zhonghe were elected as alternate directors (the first is in Hong Kong and the second is in Henan, so they could not attend the meeting when it was convened, so they were elected as alternate directors). In the afternoon, a board meeting was held to discuss the direction of the society's work and to establish various committees for separate research and to edit publications, it is said.</p>

<p>China Wins Two Singles Against Portugal</p>
<p>America Wins One Singles Against England</p>
<p>China vs. Portugal, England vs. America, Double Matches This Afternoon</p>
<p>The third Rotary Cup International Tennis Tournament kicked off yesterday. Players from the four participating countries, China, the United States, England, and Portugal, took to the court and worked hard to fulfill their respective missions. Unexpectedly, four to five hundred people gathered on the Chinese tennis court, some said it was a miniature of the World Davis Cup. Within three hours, the result of the four countries' players competing was that China won two singles matches against Portugal, and the United States won a singles match against England. There was also a singles match between England and the United States that was not played due to a misunderstanding on the time of both sides, and will be decided by the committee tomorrow. Starting at 3:00 PM today, England vs. America and China vs. Portugal will hold doubles matches.</p>
<p>China's two singles were represented by Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia, while Portugal was represented by Xiao Tofoska and Navarro. Portugal's fighting strength is far inferior to before, and both singles matches were lost in straight sets.</p>
<h3 id="e160">(1) Lin Baohua Calmly Defeats Opponent <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Lin Baohua (China) 6-2 6-2 6-3 Xiao Tofoska (Portugal)</p>
<p>Lin Baohua can still be called one of the top figures in Shanghai tennis. That Xiao Tofoska is only a second- or third-rate player. It is a well-known fact that he is controlled by Lin and runs under his command. In the first set, Xiao Tofoska inexplicably captured the second and fifth games, and the remaining lost games were lost without knowing what happened. The situation in the second set was also vaguely similar. In short, the power of life and death was in Lin's hands. In the third set, Xiao Tofoska struggled and fought, using all his strength, hoping to recover something. For a while, he tied the score at 3-3, which was the moment of his momentary triumph that day. His fast serve is the best of his various techniques. In addition, he was extremely impatient, so every move made the viewers couldn't help but smile. Lin showed a calm attitude towards this opponent, and his lifelong skills were hidden and not revealed, perhaps because he couldn't bear to use them. As a result, Lin won with a score of 6-2, 6-2, 6-3.</p>
<h3 id="e161">(2) Zheng Zhaojia Forcefully Defeats Veteran <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia (China) 6-3 8-6 6-1 Canavano (Portugal)</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia, who is regarded as the second Lin Baohua and shows unlimited potential, played against the veteran Canavano of Portugal yesterday in the name of the Chinese team. After three rounds of drumming, applause rose from all sides. The old general abandoned his armor and fled, and the young hero returned in triumph. Zheng has many great records in his own battle history, defeating Takei, defeating Huite, and once defeating De Fu at Lushan. Now he has also heard of defeating Canavano. Zheng Zhaojia's past is like this, he can be the leader of the new generation of masters without shame. As for the rest of the future, I hope he will become one of the famous masters in the Far East as soon as possible. I think Zheng has been thinking and planning about this early on. Canavano lost, but those who watched the game from the sidelines, except for seeing him slightly weak in the third set, still maintained his general demeanor. As a result, Zheng won in straight sets with a score of 6-3, 8-6, 6-1.</p>
<p>▲Catching up later</p>
<p>In the first set, Canavano served first and was cautious. He won the first game. Zheng had the potential to win in the second game, but still failed, because he was impatient. Zheng won the third game without losing a ball. Zheng made many unforced errors in the fourth game and eventually failed, making it 1-3, taking the upper hand. The audience felt cold, but unexpectedly, this aroused the young man's heroic spirit, and he caught up later. He turned danger into safety in the fifth game and won it. The victory in the sixth game depended on the strength of his serve. Zheng had a superhuman performance in the seventh, eighth, and ninth games. He was able to cope with the attacks and was good at attacking. As a result, he won them one by one, resulting in a 6-3 victory.</p>
<p>▲Struggling hard</p>
<p>In the second set, Zheng served first. Canavano was distracted and lost four consecutive points. The first game also belonged to Zheng. Zheng lost his balance in the second game and made many unforced errors. This game went to Canavano (1-1). Each won one game in the third and fourth games, splitting the difference. The fifth and sixth games were the most exciting. Both sides were evenly matched and it was difficult to tell who was better. As a result, Canavano won the fifth game, and Zheng won the sixth game. After the score was tied at 3-3, Canavano swept back and forth, and every serve was extremely fast and difficult to resist. As a result, Zheng was controlled by him and lost the seventh and eighth games, creating an unfavorable situation of 3-5. The ninth game was a matter of life and death. Canavano had a great momentum to take it all down. Soon he took a 3-1 lead. At that time, Zheng calmly responded to the battle, focusing all his attention on attack and defense, escaping from death, turning defeat into victory, and making it 4-5. Zheng won the tenth game in a row, making it 5-5. Waves suddenly rose from the flat ground. Canavano won the eleventh game. From the twelfth game to the fourteenth game, Zheng devoted all his energy to the match, and Canavano didn't know what to do and allowed himself to be slaughtered. As a result, Zheng won again with a score of 8-6.</p>
<p>▲Completing it in one breath</p>
<p>The third set was a one-sided situation. Canavano seemed to have lost his combat ability. He repeatedly changed his strategy, but it was ineffective. After Zheng won two games, Canavano took one game. After this, it was Zheng's world again. Canavano was at his command. As a result, Zheng won again with a score of 6-1.</p>
<h3 id="e162">(3) Squire Defeats Stock <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Squire (USA) 6-4 7-5 6-3 Stock (England)</p>
<p>In the battle between American player Squire and British player Stock, although the former won in straight sets, every game and set was very close, and even just moving a hand up and down took a lot of effort. The reason why the winner won was that the difference in skills was very small. After 1-1, 2-2, 3-3, and 4-4 in the first set, Squire managed to launch a series of attacks and won with a score of 6-4. Stock was very successful in the second set, and the game turned into an extremely advantageous position of 5-2. What is easily gained is also easily lost. Between the moments, Squire won five consecutive games and turned the game to a 7-5 victory. At the beginning of the third set, Squire took advantage of the victory and made it 5-1 in one fell swoop. Stock tried hard to resist, and although there was a slight improvement, he eventually failed with a score of 3-6.</p>

<p>▲To Be Held at Mingyuan</p>
<p>Advocates of swimming, Yu Binqi, Hong Zunsan, Wang Jianxin, and others, realizing the immaturity of the Chinese people's swimming skills and the lack of instructors, believe that it is necessary to compete with Chinese and Westerners as a mirror. They visited Mr. Jimi, the manager of Mingyuan, last night and decided on the following methods: gathering gentlemen and ladies from various countries to hold a major swimming competition, which is scheduled to be held at 8:00 PM on the 12th. The events are: (1) 50-meter freestyle, (2) 100-meter backstroke, (3) 25-meter freestyle (women), (4) 100-meter freestyle, (5) 25-meter backstroke (women), (6) 200-meter breaststroke, (7) 25-meter breaststroke (women), (8) 400-meter freestyle, (9) Water floating distance, (10) Fancy diving. The prizes are: gold medals for the first place in each event, silver medals for the second place, and bronze medals for the third place, which are made by Ximen Standard Sports Company. A large silver shield will be awarded as the individual championship, all of which will be borne by Mingyuan. The scoring method is based on the 5-3-2-1 system. The registration place is Jimi's Western Restaurant next to the Sichuan Road Navy Youth Association. Each person is limited to register for three events. After registration, a Mingyuan monthly season ticket will be issued - from the date of registration to the 12th, you can enter the park for free practice at any time, and admission tickets are also free of charge. It is hoped that Shanghai's swimming masters will register as soon as possible, so that they can practice purely, win the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Gold Bar Prices Suddenly Show Strength <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲ Breaking Through the 740 Tael Barrier</p>
<p>Yesterday, gold bar prices showed unusual strength, breaking through the 740 tael barrier once again. Progressing steadily with small retreats after large gains, prices rose nearly six taels in half a day. Market sentiment among traders was strong, with demand exceeding supply. The market opened steadily. Although silver prices rose, exchange rates continued to plummet, stimulating the depreciation of the US dollar. The forward rate was initially firm but then softened, showing a long position in appearance but easing in reality. In the end, Hengxing and other shorts aggressively covered their positions, and some speculated that a certain bank was opening positions in physical gold. As a result, prices soared, showing a sharp upward trend. The gray market even reached above 43 taels. Because the market will be closed on Saturday, and considering that the market situation has been fluctuating this week without significant changes, from the highest price of 46.2 taels at the beginning of the week, followed by a weakening of foreign exchange rates that broke through 40 taels, to the final price of 35.6 taels on Friday due to the continued decline in exchange rates and a sudden reversal upward, the total difference for the week was 11.6 taels, with a net drop of 4 taels. The detailed market conditions yesterday are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Increase of 5.8 Taels</p>
<p>The September contract opened at 737.2 taels, slightly higher by 7 qian. Although the major bars and the American bank rose by a quarter, private telegrams rose slightly by one-sixteenth. Furthermore, the exchange rate plummeted by three fen, reversing market sentiment. The market opened high. Hengxing, Yuanshunli, Yifeng, Yongwanxing, and others showed strong selling intentions, immediately dropping the price by one tael to 6.7 qian. In an instant, Yuanmao, Yonghengchang, Yongheng, Yuhong, Kangyong, Dayong, and Runyong were buying aggressively. Hengxing and Yuanfu were also buying strongly, pushing the price up by 2 taels. At 9:15, the price was 39 taels. The China Merchants Bank started absorbing the October gold from the Bank of England at 9 pence, and the Meifeng, Citibank, and Hua Bi absorbed August US dollars at 125. At this time, Yifeng, Yongheng, Yude, Cheng Yuhe, and others were selling off. HSBC sold August US dollars to Zhengjin at 0625, causing the price to fall back slightly by 1.23 qian to 7.7 qian. Hengxing, Tong Taichang, Yongfeng, and others entered the market to buy, pulling up the price by 1.1 qian to 8.8 qian. News came that the Bank of England had extended the forward rate by one level, bringing the price to 38 taels. However, the US dollar only increased by 125, which was a minor exchange rate adjustment. The domestic market was stable. Hengxing, Yongfeng, Zhifeng, Yong Yifeng, Yongheng Xingyuan, Fuyuanyuan, Taifu, and Taiheng competed to buy, while the Huarbi absorbed the October US dollar at 3125 and the Macalli absorbed the November US dollar at 4375, pushing the market price above 40 taels. At 10:00, the price was 40.5 taels. Hengxing and Yuanfu came out to sell, dropping the price back to 39.2 taels. Afterward, buying interest intensified. Hengxing, Zhaofeng, Changtong Taichang, Hengyu, and Taibang, Yuanmao Yong, and others all entered the market. Furthermore, HSBC absorbed the August Bank of England gold at 8125, and the American Commercial Bank absorbed 30 yuan of US dollars, causing the price to rebound by 2 taels. From 10:15 to 11:00, the price fluctuated slightly by a few qian. At 11:15, the price rose to 41.2 taels. At this time, the Central Bank absorbed 105 physical bars, further boosting confidence. Hengxing Yong Zhifeng Yonglai exited, surpassing 2 taels to 40.03 taels. Afterwards, shorts aggressively covered their positions, with Tong Taichang Da Decheng Boxin Yuan Run Chang Yu Zhou Feng Heng and others buying actively. In half an hour, the price soared by 2 taels to 42.4 taels. The market closed at 42.3 taels, a rebound of 5.8 taels compared to the previous evening. After the close, small shorts continued to enter, and physical deliveries were also delayed, pushing the price up to 43.45 taels. The closing price was essentially even. Because of the Saturday closing, the price of the major bars still increased by 8.5 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Official Price Reduced by 8 Taels</p>
<p>The official price was revised to 807 taels because the US dollar was listed at a premium of 125, totaling 70 to 65 taels, 8 taels less than the previous day. The registered price was 42 taels, and the supplemental tax was 40 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Active Trading in the Market</p>
<p>Trading on the trading floor was very active, with buyers dominating. Statistics show that Hengxing, Hengchang Yong, Yuankangxiang, Tong Dachang, Tong Fenghang, Qianchangxiang, Futaiheng, Yuantai, Yongfeng, Runchangyu, Hongkangyong, Zhaofengchang, and Dakang were all actively buying. Zhifeng Yong, Da Decheng, Hengyu, Wanxing, Shunli, Yuanxing Yong, and Yuhe were all actively trading in and out. Hengxing Yuan traded a total of several thousand bars, with more buying than selling. Yuanmao Yong exited and then re-entered. Yifeng Yong, Taifengcheng, and small traders were all selling. Demand and supply were complex among other firms. Physical deliveries were sold when prices rose and bought when prices fell. Forward exchange contracts were all being bought. The total value of gold bar contracts was approximately 22,000. Hengxing was still short 4,000 to 5,000 bars. Yuanxing Yong was long 4,000 to 5,000, but both had decreased compared to before. No other firms had significant positions.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Silver Prices Rise, Exchange Rates Fall; Foreign Exchange Trends Differ, Pound Weak, Dollar Tight <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, silver prices rose, and exchange rates continued to plummet, causing Shanghai's foreign exchange market to show divergent trends. HSBC's listed exchange rates increased by one level, with the Bank of England rate rising to 1 shilling 8.625 pence, while the US dollar only increased by 125, to 29.75 yuan.

The Indian rupee increased by 1.25 yuan, the French franc increased by 2 yuan, the Japanese yen increased by 25, the German mark increased by half a mark, and the Singapore dollar decreased by 1.5 taels. The domestic market saw the Bank of England rate continuing to be strong, while the US dollar was tight. From the morning, the Bank of England rate was weak and the US dollar rate was flat, but both turned bullish later. The gold market showed a strong trend, breaking through 740 taels again, disappointing the shorts who rushed to cover their positions. This was the opposite of the previous day and was unexpected. By the close of the morning, the Bank of England rate had increased by only 0.0625, while the US dollar rate had decreased by 0.1875, all due to the sharp decline in exchange rates. The price changes in the market were difficult to predict. The volume of Bank of England transactions was tens of thousands of pounds, and the volume of US dollar transactions was 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. Chinese gold firms and speculators were selling off, while others were making forward gold transactions, pulling up prices. Near-term contracts were above 50 taels, and long-term contracts were above 40 taels, with price differences of several taels depending on the gold price. The closing price was 645 taels. The market was closed in the afternoon due to the weekend. The morning transactions are recorded below.</p>

<p>(American Eastern Bank Company Weekend Report)</p>
<p>This week, the New York stock market showed even sharper gains than the previous week. Except for a slight reaction on Tuesday, new highs were seen every day. Industrial stocks progressed even faster, rising an average of 5 points in one day on Wednesday and nearly 3 points on Friday. Every other day (except Tuesday) also saw gains of over 1 point. The recent Dow Jones index reached 62.60, an increase of over 21 points from this year's low of 41.22. In terms of transactions, the number of shares traded each day was mostly 2-3 million, and at least over 1 million. According to market participants, veteran speculators have not been very active in the market recently. Therefore, the rise in prices is not due to manipulation by large forces. Moreover, many investors are taking profits, but the market remains in short supply. In this situation, there is no reason for short-selling. From this analysis, it is likely that stocks will continue to rise in the future. The Dow Jones index for this week is shown below:</p>
<p>Industrial, Railroad, Utility</p>
<p>July 30 54.26, 21.74, 22.79</p>
<p>August 4 59.63, 21.95, 24.20</p>

<h3 id="e183">Yarn Flowers Cotton Yarn Inventory Reduction a Great Success <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The actual demand for cotton yarn has become active again. The Huaxin Yarn Factory in Tianjin shipped 1,500 bales of 10-count yarn to Shanghai, which were all purchased by the Sichuan merchants. This greatly shocked people's minds, and the market price rose sharply. However, sellers, due to numerous rumors in Shanghai, had the idea of ​​selling out quickly, so the market price remained stable. If demand from other merchant groups continues, there will naturally be upward pressure. The condition of domestic flower yarn is still relatively stable, with domestic yarn increasing by one yuan and foreign yarn by three yuan, probably due to exchange rate factors.</p>
<p>▲Upward Pressure on Human Bids Not Weak The opening of the human bid market earlier saw prices rise due to the rise in American cotton and the lack of medium-grade cotton for sale. However, none of the bids for this month were successful, and all four market positions were flat. Only the August bids rose by five or six cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Sichuan merchants were sending out instructions, and spot yarn sales rose to make up for positions, tightening the market further. Near-term prices rose by one, two, three, or four cents, while long-term prices rose by one or two cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,650 bales. The purchases included 1,000 bales by Rongxing, 1,000 bales by Changyu, 850 bales by Changlai, 750 bales by Daji, and 600 bales by Taichang. Sales included 1,300 bales to Xiesheng, 1,400 bales to Senkang, 1,400 bales to Yiyu, and 600 bales to Yukang. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>▲Sichuan Merchants Actively Purchasing Spot Goods Spot yarn sales have improved, and Sichuan merchants are actively purchasing. Statistics for the day show that various merchant groups purchased a total of 1,500 bales. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. The amount purchased by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Sichuan 1,350</p>

<p>The cotton market is trending firm, as American cotton is stable, gold prices have risen again, and sentiment is increasingly positive. Moreover, the bottom inventory of local cotton is extremely scarce, and buyers are eager. Although some major players are selling, the market is not significantly affected. Some say that a certain foreign merchant has entrusted a foreign firm to purchase tens of thousands of dan of long-term cotton, so the long-term market is particularly expensive. Furthermore, the recent weather has been too dry, hindering the growth of new cotton.</p>
<p>▲Zheng Bids Good for Two or Three Cents The opening of the Zheng bid market saw American cotton rise slightly, but buying interest in the market was not strong. Prices for all months rose by one cent, and prices for two or three positions rose again. As a result, prices for all months rose by one and a half cents. In the afternoon, the yarn market was good, and prices for all months rose by one or two cents again. The total transaction volume for the day was 48,500 dan. Sales included 6,100 dan by Hengde, 2,700 dan by Jifeng, 4,100 dan by Gengfeng, 2,000 dan by Huilong, 1,600 dan by Yichang, 1,700 dan by Xincheng, and 1,600 dan by Ruiyuan. Purchases included 4,700 dan by Xiesheng, 1,200 dan by Rongxing, 1,400 dan by Senkang, 2,600 dan by Yongda, and 2,200 dan by Yuanda. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>▲Slight Demand from Spot Cotton Mills Spot cotton consumption is still decent, and various mills are showing some interest. It is reported that 950 bales of Yao flower cotton were sourced. Shaanxi flower cotton: 31.75. Hongzhang Factory took in 100 pieces, sent to the factory again...32.00...another 100 pieces. Also, Schmidt ordered 55.00.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially rose steadily due to a lack of sellers and strength on Wall Street. Later, due to some long positions closing, prices slightly weakened. Futures rose by 5 to 9 points, while spot prices rose by 5 points. British cotton futures rose by 6 or 7 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton was firm due to the weakness of the British pound and speculative buying. Pingguo'er rose by 3.5 rupees, and Ola and Bairoxi rose by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 5th).</p>

<p>New York, 5th. McFadden Company's estimate of this year's new cotton production is 12,596,000 bales. Also, the U.S. Cotton Collection Office estimates this year's new cotton production to be 67.3% of the normal annual production, totaling 11,824,000 bales.</p>

<p>▲Dry and Hot Weather in the South</p>
<p>New York, August 5th telegram reports the market conditions for the week: The improvement in commercial sentiment, coupled with the active market prices of miscellaneous grains and securities, has kept the raw cotton market stable throughout the week. The market was particularly firm at the end of the week, coinciding with reports that bankers were planning to raise US$30 million in funds to increase the prices of wheat and cotton. At the beginning of the week, raw cotton continued to be sold. In the past three weeks, cooperatives have sold a total of about 200,000 bales, but this amount has been absorbed by short covering and purchases by the industry. Long positions closing and evening up have curbed the upward trend of cotton prices. The reason for the closing and evening up of positions is that the government's cotton production report will be released on Monday. Due to dry and hot weather in Texas, many places have reported cotton bolls falling off and opening prematurely. At the same time, according to some reports from the eastern cotton belt, the reduced use of fertilizers, unfavorable weather, and damage from boll weevils have reduced the potential for production by 40% compared to the same period last year. However, some cotton merchants are questioning whether the degradation of cotton production is more severe than usual. According to private estimates, the average condition of cotton crops at the end of July was 68%, compared to 74% last month, estimating the number of bales to be around 12,168,000. The weekend statistics are appended below (unit: thousand bales). Cumulative Listing for the Season</p>

<p>▲South Shanghai Yesterday, about a dozen suppliers arrived from the west. Sales on this street were more active than before. Changxi japonica rice was fresh and stable. Zhongguanlong was down one jiao. Dongxin and early and late rice opened lower by two jiao each in the morning. Yang Dujian sold as soon as it arrived, with the price rising by five fen. Bianyin yuan was scarce and without a market.</p>
<p>▲Xinzha Yesterday, more than 20 suppliers arrived from various routes. Trading on this street was sluggish and stagnant. Changxi Beigeng japonica rice was one jiao weaker, and secondary grade was two jiao weaker. Kunshan and Jiangyin rice arrived and sold at par. There was a lack of fresh early rice. Zhongguan rice was slightly available, and the situation stabilized. The market situation for new japonica rice was similar to that in the South Market, with a total of about 1,500 to 1,600 shi traded throughout the day.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Foreign Rice Stable in the Morning, Rising in the Afternoon <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was initially stable and then rose, with the situation becoming more stable. Sentiment was very good in the morning, but demand was not strong. Only Yongbang slightly purchased old Xiaojiao rice. Retailers on this street did not see large purchases, and the market turned from firm to soft. In the afternoon, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi merchants rushed to purchase in the market. Although the transaction volume was not high, the market price increased by three to five fen. A total of 5,000 bags of Xiaojiao rice were sold at prices ranging from 9.55 yuan to 9.32 yuan. Old Xiaojiao rice was sold at 9.15 yuan. 300 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were sold at 10.03 yuan. 100 bags of Annam japonica rice were sold at 11.60 yuan. The market turned firm and stable. If demand becomes stronger again, the market price has the potential to rise. However, with the stock decreasing, the holders' sentiment turned firm, and sentiment was no longer as uncertain as before.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Tianjin Merchants Sell Off 150,000 Bags of Spot Flour <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>▲Standards Generally Stable</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, the market for each month was generally stable. As the quoted price of foreign wheat improved by about three jiao, the sentiment outside the industry tended to be stable. However, factories such as Fuxin and Gaofeng, either due to the accumulation of spot goods or the hedging of foreign wheat, successively sold off their inventories. Therefore, although inland merchants unanimously looked bullish due to the drought, they failed to raise prices. As for Tianjin merchants, it was heard that they sold off 150,000 bags of spot flour, including 100,000 bags of "Warship" brand and 50,000 bags of "Artillery Car" brand. Judging from this, spot sales are still active, and the flour market may be able to hold its ground. As a result, this month improved by 2.5 li compared to the previous day, September improved by 5 li, October improved by 2.5 li, November improved by 5 li, and December improved by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Term Wheat Initially Popular, Then Weak <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>▲Continued Order of Foreign Wheat Confirmed</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the term wheat market opened in the morning, the market for each month showed a trend of initial stability followed by weakness. Initially, the sentiment was good because the quoted price of foreign wheat rose by three jiao. However, because most large holders sold off positions, and Dingtai also sold off a significant amount, and it was heard that another shipment of foreign wheat was ordered at a price that remained a secret, selling pressure was very strong. Near-term and long-term contracts both weakened and fell sharply. Although the millers' wheat inventory was not very abundant, the accumulated flour inventory was generally between 2 million bags, so the demand for wheat will be temporarily shelved. As a result, this month fell by four fen compared to the previous day, September and October fell by six fen, and November and December fell by five fen. The spot wheat market was still stable and popular. Suqian wheat, because of its high quality, opened at a high spot price for the first time, with 800 bags opening at 3.55 yuan. It was also reported that Huafeng and Shenda factories withdrew 30 truckloads of spot wheat from the exchange yesterday at a price of 3.49 yuan. A continued order of foreign wheat was confirmed at a price of 4.10 yuan, which was purchased by inland factories.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Dried and Preserved Goods Cantonese Dried Longan Prices Upside Down <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>The price of Jinshan dried longan has fallen again in the past two days. For example, the price of superior grade flat dried longan has fallen to 25 to 26 yuan, the price of superior grade yuan dried longan is around 25 yuan, and the price of secondary grade ranges from 21 to 22 yuan. The initial price of top-grade glutinous rice dried longan once approached 82 yuan, but has now fallen to about 64 yuan. It is reported that the land price also once fell to 105 yuan, but recently it has rebounded because the goods shipped from the production area are better than before and the body is gradually drying out. Therefore, the land price has rebounded to 130 yuan, and the conversion to Shanghai currency requires more than 70 yuan, which has created an upside-down situation. It is also difficult to convert other Jinshan yuan dried longan and flat dried longan completely. It is expected that the arrival of the Shanghai market price drop telegram may ease the situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the local foreign silk market gradually became active. Jardine Matheson, Wheelock Marden, Ewo, Taching and others all received remittances from overseas, but the prices offered were still low. Yesterday, Saturday, there was only a half-day market in the morning. The various firms telegraphed Chinese silk merchants to hold a round of negotiations. A large transaction is expected next Monday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Jardine Matheson purchased 30 bales of B-grade 13-15 denier Japanese factory silk at a wholesale price of 485 yuan. Taching purchased 20 bales of medium-grade 13-15 denier Huang factory silk at a price of 500 yuan. Zhonghe purchased 30 bales of superior grade 8-denier grey silk at a price of 275 yuan.</p>

<p>Due to the economic panic in various countries around the world, import duties are being increased to make up for losses. The Ministry of Finance of our country, in view of the strange deficit in customs revenue in recent times and the increasing sales of new-style silk fabrics, and the frequent import of foreign silk (such as Japanese silk), has specifically increased the import duty on raw silk from 30% to 60%, which was announced and implemented on the 4th.</p>

<p>Yesterday, various traders were very interested in purchasing Zhenmei pearl tea from Lai Lu Zhuang, including British firms such as Xiehe, Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, and Tongfu. A total of more than 3,300 boxes of green tea were traded in the city, and the transactions were brisk. The market price was uniformly firm. The American firms also opened for business again yesterday, but there was no change in the selling price. The market for other needle-shaped tea and show-mei tea was also stable.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau believes that, in addition to the annual customs reports, there are no other survey statistics available for our country's exported tea leaves. Therefore, it has recently compiled a statistical report on the transaction volume of various types of red and green tea in the past three years, comparing monthly conditions with previous years in order to observe the recent trends in the tea market. Aside from the detailed figures for each foreign firm, the bureau has a separate detailed report. The following is a preliminary transcript of the three months starting from May, when this year's new tea was released. It is said that it will be published monthly thereafter. (Unit: boxes)</p>

<p>According to the table above, it can be seen that the sales of black tea this year have decreased significantly compared to before, while green tea has increased by about one time. According to the bureau staff, the reason for the decrease in black tea is mostly due to the impact of the Xiangguo tax increase. As for green tea, it is not that there has been a real increase in demand, but that tea merchants are eager to sell off their inventory. Recently, France's intended ban on the import of colored tea has caused foreign firms to be eager to ship, which is not without its relationship.</p>

<p>Thick overcoat wools have been successively launched yesterday, and samples were released at the Tongyi Association. Good Huawu colorful flashing overcoat wool was priced at 4.5 yuan, ordinary checkered colorful interlining wool was priced at 3.5 yuan, checkered rotten wool was priced at 1.1 yuan, and plain thick wool was priced at 2.25 yuan. Dehua Li, Laogongmao, and Anli checkered overcoat wools were priced from 6.5 yuan to 0.85 yuan. Pearl wools ranged from just over 2 yuan to 4 or 5 yuan. Therefore, looking at the overall overcoat wool market, it is really difficult to improve. The reason is that the market is bad, causing various goods to be difficult to sell unless they are cheap.</p>

<p>The metal trade was very quiet yesterday, as there were no large transactions from merchants, so the market was quite peaceful. However, the printing factory, as a dark horse, had a large transaction yesterday, with more than 1,000 boxes of tinplate purchased, more than 400 bundles of black iron sheet, and some copper sheet and French nails. However, there was no change in the market price prospects yesterday. In addition, there were several batches of new lead wire, cut-edge iron, British plate plain white iron, and new silver dollars.</p>

<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>Whenever a pressing time comes to make oaths, the typesetting rooms of various newspapers must add some oath characters.</p>
<p>The declarations of important people always say...swear not to retreat. The telegrams of soldiers always say...swear not to surrender. The talks published by responsible figures always say...swear to resist to the death, regardless of any sacrifice. The telegrams sent by various organizations always say...swear to be the backing, and fight the enemy to the death. In addition, farmers have farmers' oaths, workers have workers' oaths, and students have students' oaths. Among many lead characters, only the oath character is active, and only the oath character is busy.</p>
<p>The situation is tense, and oath characters are written in large letters on the wall! The situation is urgent, and oath characters are pasted in large letters on the wall! It is as if the oath character created by the old man Cangjie has become a modern weapon to resist the enemy. In fact, the old man Cangjie was never too clever. The oath character he created implicitly implies that it is not a real price. The oath character has "fold" above and "speech" below. It can be seen that this kind of speech contains a big discount. If the discount is small, it is 90% and 80%. If the discount is large, it is 10% and 20%. The two characters "fold" and "speech" combine to form the oath character. Speech with a discount becomes an oath, and speech without a discount does not become an oath. Thinking from the method of breaking characters, it can be seen that this oath character is unreliable.</p>
<p>Rehe is in danger! The typesetting rooms are adding oath characters again! Anyone who pays attention to current affairs must know the clear attitude of Tang Yulin, the defending general of Rehe. Good! The hot soup has been expressed! He is determined to resist Japan and swears to live and die with the city!</p>
<p>Is the hot soup oath reliable? Don't let it contain another big discount! I say...the oaths of others may be unreliable. The oath of the Tang family must be reliable. Tang said...resist Japan, determined to resist Japan. Tang said...live and die with the city, determined to live and die with the city. This is not my speculation. The ancients have already had foreknowledge. Tang's oath is recorded in the first volume of Mencius, which everyone reads thoroughly.</p>
<p>— Tang swore and said; when will this day perish? I and you shall perish together!</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Demeanor of New China <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Genxin</p>
<p>The demeanor of New China is difficult to describe completely. It is appropriate to use the phrase "Good Weather for the Crops, National Peace and Prosperity" on the top of the Great Buddha Hall as a conclusion. Chinese people who respect etiquette and civilization are by no means weak and incompetent, and are ridiculed as the "Sick Man of East Asia." In the past 20 years, the martial spirit has prevailed throughout the country. The number of warriors under the command of generals is about several million, as well as the numerous brave and adventurous bandits, which can be seen in general. Furthermore, for the sake of strengthening strength, special attention is paid to practical exercises (ie, so-called civil war).</p>
<p>Recently, some people have advocated "aiming the guns outward," which is again contrary to the dignity of our country of etiquette. Therefore, the authorities have always held high the champagne glasses and offered them to my dear tributary states.</p>
<p>China is blessed with beautiful mountains and rivers. Therefore, even courageous generals have a light and tranquil nature and an attitude of appreciating art. When they come to Mount Tai, Mount Wutai, Mount Lu, Kuling, Mount Emei, West Lake, Beidaihe, etc., they are either avoiding the summer heat or claiming illness, or chanting Buddha or holding meetings. And a romantic general who has always lived in the cold regions has held dozens of meetings with various pretexts in recent years. It is said that they do not speak at the meetings, but use their mouths for banquets, and after the banquets, they go sightseeing. They are full of energy and everyone is happy. This is a manifestation of the spirit of democracy.</p>
<p>There are also elementary school students singing the party song, middle school students becoming committee members, and university students going out to participate in activities.</p>
<p>Modern people are doing ABCD (ie, the first letters of the French words for love, beauty, song, and dance). It can truly be said that they are "working tirelessly day and night, and following the ideology."</p>
<p>Most literati and writers use artistic skills and vivid writing to create interesting texts that cater to the psychology of young people. In addition, for the sake of providing young people with shortcuts to learning, they create large-scale question-and-answer guides, outlines, and summaries. This is also the supreme glory of the publishing world in New China.</p>
<p>The activity of the party and the large number of participants clearly show the enthusiasm of the people to "jointly overcome national difficulties."</p>
<p>After the conclusion of the boycott movement, blue-eyed high officials may have to send congratulatory telegrams to our people, and first to the modern men and women.</p>
<p>Chinese movie theaters are springing up like mushrooms after rain, introducing the romantic affairs of the highest peaks in the world, and hinting at one of the ways out for Chinese youth.</p>
<p>Newspapers are routinely prepared to publish moving social news and sports news in large columns, as well as more than half of the advertisements that suit people's tastes.</p>
<p>Recently, there are even dazzling, colorful film newspapers appearing, which are one of the bibles for film fans.</p>
<p>Everyone says "national crisis is imminent," but enjoyment is still enjoyed. In a word, it is all "contradiction"!</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Middle School Student's Predicament <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yunfei</p>
<p>The other day, upon reading an article titled "The Middle School Student's Predicament" in (Freedom Forum), my heart resonated with infinite sympathy. Speaking from my own experience, after ten years of diligent study and dedicated effort, I finally obtained a middle school diploma from a prestigious Shanghai school this summer. However, what will happen after graduation? This significant (?) always lingers in my mind.</p>
<p>Should I pursue further education? But pursuing further education is not easy either. First, it requires financial ease. Universities are institutions for the children of the wealthy. Ordinary poor students can only stop short. After solving the economic problem, there is still the significant issue of finding a university. I have already hesitated considerably in this matter. There are now over forty universities in China, but how many of them can truly satisfy people? Some universities are superficial and impractical, aiming solely to cultivate a large group of gentlemen and ladies. Some universities are controlled by politicians, becoming battlegrounds for political parties. Still other universities are corrupt beyond imagination, with diplomas being given out indiscriminately. I ask, would a thoughtful young person be willing to apply to such a university? Truly, from my observation, I feel that apart from a few universities in Beiping—Yenching and Tsinghua, etc.—there are practically no good schools. However, Beiping is facing a precarious situation, with rumors flying and an imminent crisis, deterring most scholars.</p>
<p>Then, should I look for a job? Humph! What can a middle school student do? The authorities of middle schools never think about middle school students finding jobs. They simply fail to instill knowledge about social service in the minds of middle school students. As a result, they create a large group of high-level idlers who only know how to consume and not produce. I am inevitably one of them, with nothing to do at all.</p>
<p>The above is the pain I feel personally. I hope that educators who run universities and middle schools in the future can undertake reforms to prevent a large group of middle school students from being at a loss about their future.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Random Notes on Amber <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Bowen</p>
<p>Having read Mr. Ninety-Three's article "(The Miracle of the Traveling Herbalist)" in this publication, I will offer my knowledge for discussion. Mr. Ninety-Three's article can be divided into three points: 1. The authenticity of amber; 2. The origin of amber; 3. Why amber can cure heart disease.</p>
<p>Now, amber is a mineral with many varieties. Lei Xiao stated that the genuine amber is red as blood. When rubbed against cloth, the genuine kind attracts mustard seeds. Amber imported from Japan is transparent with a deep red color. The Chinese call it blood amber or gold amber. This is the best quality. The slightly lighter color is called silver amber, the second best. Light yellow amber is called wax amber, the next best. The amber with black color is considered inferior. (Mr. Ninety-Three mentioned that most of the amber seen in the country is dark crystal color, which belongs to this kind.) See the Daily Use Medicine Examination.</p>
<p>Regarding the name of amber, Li Shizhen said, "(When a tiger dies, its spirit enters the earth and turns into stone. This object resembles it, so it is called tiger's spirit. The common writing uses jade because it is similar to jade.)" Let us continue with this explanation.</p>
<p>Its origin is due to the resin of coniferous plants, buried in the ground, which turns into stone over a long time. Therefore, it is often found in the third and fourth underground layers, scattered among small stones of sand, clay, and limestone. Amber obtained from the seashore probably comes from the underground layers. It is mostly produced along the coasts of East Asia, and in sand or seawater in countries such as Russia, Germany, Poland, Sweden, and Denmark. The Book of Han, Records of the Western Regions, stated that amber comes from foreign countries. The elders passed down the legend that amber is transformed from pine resin, which is not unfounded. It is indeed a transformed stone tree gum, not a kind of wood resin. Some specifically refer to the resin of pine and maple. However, wood resin turns into stone after being buried for thousands of years, but it does not age as much as the resin of pine and maple.</p>
<p>Amber can cure heart disease, as seen in medical books. It is not a secret exclusively known by traveling herbalists. However, the so-called heart disease is limited to symptoms such as heart pain, restlessness, epilepsy, and other ailments. The reason is that its components are resin, volatile oil, succinic acid, succinoresinol, and sulfur, etc. The contained penetrating and volatile oil-salts have the effect of opening up the brain's nerves. External use is effective for treating local paralysis and chronic joint rheumatism. However, there is no evidence to support the traveling herbalist's use of it for treating palpitations.</p>
<p>Additionally, amber oil is a very effective rat poison. Its effective ingredient is succinic acid. The method is to mix succinic acid with ox bile and buckwheat flour that rats like to eat, and make them into pills. Rats eat it and immediately become covered in bristling hair, feel thirsty and want to die. They drink water if they can get it, but the more they drink, the thirstier they become. Gradually, their movements become sluggish. Within three and a half to twenty-seven hours after eating, they all die. See the Tokyo Veterinary New Report, which is not found in Chinese medical books. (Thank you)</p>

<p>(3) (10) Foot Flower Textile Factory</p>
<p>Cotton spinning and weaving is one of the major industries in our country. However, few know how to utilize the leftover foot flowers (cotton waste), which are sold to foreigners at a low price to manufacture products such as blankets, absorbent cotton, and toys, and then imported back into the country. The profit made in this one turnaround is enormous. The scale of the leakage is imaginable. In recent years, the Shanghai Minsheng Yarn Factory has taken the lead in utilizing foot flowers and engaging in waste spinning. This was followed by the Tongcheng Textile Company, and then six or seven factories such as Jingwei, Qinfeng, and Shenxin followed suit. In particular, Tongcheng Textile Company has the most complete equipment, with spinning, weaving, bleaching, and dyeing all available. The factory is located in Qishuyan, Changzhou, on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, covering an area of over 160 acres. It borders the canal to the south and the railway to the north. Within the factory, the industrial operations are divided into a cotton production department, a bleaching and dyeing department, a spinning department, and a weaving department. The machines are all purchased from famous German factories, arranged neatly, and fully equipped. The products include 4-count and 6-count coarse yarn, gray military blankets, patterned and plain flannelette, shuttlecocks, socks, scarves, and absorbent cotton gauze. Among them, the flannelette blankets and flannelette are brightly colored and sturdy. The gray military blankets are produced in the hundreds of thousands each year and are of excellent quality. The factory's products have been selling very well in recent years because they are cheaper and of better quality compared to foreign goods. In terms of factory management, they are quite able to cater to the trends of the times and treat their employees very well, with facilities such as a cooperative, a clinic, a small school, a garden, and a bathroom. The factory interior and exterior are unusually spacious, with lush trees, so that even in the height of summer, it does not feel hot. It can accommodate more than a thousand workers. Although there is no labor union organization, the relationship between labor and management is harmonious.</p>

<p>I asked: (What conditions are necessary for a work-study group to succeed?) Mr. Zhu said: (First, there must be the determination to start it; second, there must be the technical skills to work; third, there must be available raw materials; fourth, there must be labor; and fifth, there must be capital.)</p>
<p>I asked: (If we start a work-study group in a traditional school, the determination to start lies in the change of attitude; the technical skills to work can be learned with an open mind; the available raw materials are naturally locally sourced; labor is readily available, and the willingness to use it is also a matter of a change of mind; but the capital, in this time of national poverty, how can it be obtained?)</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said: (It is readily available! As long as we change our minds, the great capital is right in front of our eyes and we do not need to ask others. Go to the Ministry of Education and find the recently published Education Statistics Overview, and we can calculate how much capital we can use.)</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>We obtained some astonishing facts from the statistics of the Ministry of Education and other sources. From August of the 7th year of the Republic of China to July of the 18th year, there were 86 registered public and private universities and specialized schools nationwide, with 6,985 faculty and staff members, 53,410 students, and an expenditure of 36.79 million yuan. There were 1,339 public and private secondary schools nationwide, including those not registered, with 30,348 faculty and staff members, 234,811 students, and an expenditure of 24.6 million yuan. The personal expenses of university students were about 300 yuan per person per year, totaling 16.02 million yuan. The personal expenses of middle school students were about 150 yuan per person per year, totaling 35.22 million yuan. Adding personal expenses to school expenses, the 86 universities and specialized schools consume 52.82 million yuan of national strength per year, and the 1,339 secondary schools consume 59.82 million yuan of national strength per year. The total annual consumption of schools above the middle school level is 112.64 million yuan. This consumption is spent every year, and continuing to consume it for ten years means that 1,126.4 million yuan will vanish into thin air. We are simply teaching people to sit idle and deplete their resources by running some schools that do not engage in production. If everyone changes their minds and schools become work-study groups, this annual consumption of 112.64 million yuan will immediately turn into productive capital, and 37,000 teachers and 287,000 students will transform from high-level idlers into productive workers. The 86 universities, each with 600,000 yuan of capital, would become a medium-sized factory. The 1,339 secondary schools, each with 46,000 yuan of capital, would become a small factory. Since capital is used for production, it will roll up year after year. After ten years, each medium-sized factory would have 6 million yuan of capital and become a large factory, and each small factory would have 460,000 yuan of capital and become a medium-sized factory. In this way, we can turn a poor China into a rich China. If we do not change our minds, we will lose both people and money, and we will all lament, "Alas? Chinese nation?" This idea must be changed quickly!</p>

<h3 id="e209">The Reasons for the Occurrence of Emotion and the True Meaning of Emotion <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Xia</p>
<p>This publication has already published many excellent articles on issues such as fidelity, remarriage, marriage, suicide, and sexual desire. I feel that these issues contain a fundamental major issue, which is the word (emotion).</p>
<p>The ancients discussed emotion by focusing on the superficial meaning and nature, praising things like emotional obsession, emotional seed, true emotion, false emotion, passion, cold emotion, emotion of utmost sincerity, pure emotion, etc. There is truly no end to the list. However, the reasons for the occurrence of emotion and the true meaning of emotion have not been mentioned even once.</p>
<p>Humans are the animals most rich in emotion, so to study the word "emotion," we cannot find its true meaning by focusing solely on human activities. It is best to use a biological perspective to examine the phenomena of the animal kingdom, and then we will understand.</p>
<p>The occurrence of emotion in the animal kingdom is gradually evolving. The lowest animals cannot be said to have any emotion. Their bodies are simple, they live independently, reproduce by fission, have no distinction between male and female, and slightly higher animals only temporarily join (not mate) for a moment during the breeding season and then separate, still living and dying independently. It is difficult to speculate whether there is any emotion between the two bodies.</p>
<p>In higher animals, such as insects, fish, frogs, birds, and beasts, most also mate during the breeding season. At this time, between the two bodies, in order to seek the propagation of the species, various joyful (feelings) naturally appear. Fierce creatures such as tigers, leopards, and venomous creatures such as snakes and scorpions also become gentle at this moment. However, after this once, they scatter in different directions, and the root of emotion remains weak. Only spiders are heartless and extremely cruel. After mating, the male often faces the misfortune of being killed and eaten by the female, which can be considered a unique exception in the animal kingdom.</p>
<p>A few higher birds, such as sparrows and swallows, and a few beasts, such as apes and monkeys, after mating, the male and female still live together and raise their young together. Thus, the emotion of mutual affection and love becomes even stronger, and the duration of love also becomes longer. However, when the chicks grow wings, they fly away on their own. When the calves have feet, they run away without saying goodbye. An old couple, because the responsibility of reproduction has come to an end, also sings a farewell song and declares a divorce on their own without a judge's ruling. In the coming year, they each seek new lovers and live together again, repeating the law of nature's endless cycle. Only the highest gorillas and humans, after mating, live together permanently, with the strongest and longest-lasting emotions. Human society has also created marriage rituals to prevent promiscuity and established laws to prevent variations.</p>
<p>Looking at the entire animal kingdom, I can draw a conclusion: (1) (Emotion) gradually occurs with the evolution of animals. The higher the animal, the stronger and longer-lasting the emotion. Why is there (emotion)? Initially, it was to maintain the species and produce offspring. Therefore, the original (emotion) is entirely the (emotion) of male-female union.</p>
<p>(2) Since the occurrence of (emotion) is built on male-female union, it can be seen that the effect of (emotion) is to make the male and female happily unite, willingly and gladly, to sacrifice energy for the species and raise offspring. This is the true meaning of (emotion).</p>
<p>When animals evolved to the point where males and females live together permanently, then love and filial piety (emotion) arise between parents and children, and brotherly and sisterly (emotion) arise between siblings. Furthermore, harmony, respect, and love (emotion) arise between relatives and friends. The power of these emotions lies in increasing the interest of life and promoting social peace and progress.</p>
<p>Young men and women, the word (emotion) actually contains the roots of duty. If you only talk about love to seek spiritual comfort and physical protection, it is too selfish. If you feel willing to fulfill the responsibility of propagating the species, you might as well embrace celibacy and do some other work that contributes to society. If you are unwilling to abandon the natural duty of reproduction, as long as you choose a partner who is healthy in body and mind and who shares your feelings, you can get married. In this time of crisis, you should not live extravagantly. Once married, you should each fulfill your duties and naturally have a good life. You must not imitate the lower animals and casually break off the relationship. If you commit suicide because of unrequited love, it shows your lack of awareness and misunderstanding of the whole of life. If a couple unfortunately dies young, leaving behind weak children and orphans, a widow's willingness to maintain her fidelity, sacrifice her personal happiness, and complete her unfinished responsibility of raising the children is admirable and worthy of respect. It is wrong to forcibly deprive her of her will. If she has no children and it is difficult to make a living, she is unwilling to give up her duty of being able to reproduce and remarries another, which is in accordance with the great law of nature. How can it be considered a loss of fidelity? As for indulging in physical pleasure and engaging in vulgar behavior, one can only be regarded as an animal. How can that be (human) or (emotion)?</p>

<p>— Zhong Rui</p>
<p>The meaning of Immunization is to enable the body to adapt to itself when a foreign protein (Note 1) occurs in the body. It means the ability to resist the aggression of Pathogenic Microorganisms. Immunity is divided into two categories: (1) Passive immunity; (2) Active immunity</p>
<p>(1) Passive Immunity This type of immunization method involves administering Antitoxin or Anti Bacterial serum to the patient. This serum, after being injected into the human body, cannot cause the patient to develop any antitoxic effects on their own, but provides the patient with special resistance factors. These resistance factors are mostly taken from other animals, such as horses and cows. A small amount of pathogens is injected into the body of a horse, and the resistance factors for these pathogens exist in the horse's blood. We devise a way to obtain these resistance factors and store them well, preventing them from being destroyed, and then use them when humans or other animals are infected.</p>
<p>Passive immunity is applied during acute infection to assist in the operation of the patient's internal tissue functions, destroy bacteria, and relieve and neutralize the toxins produced by the bacteria. The effective period of passive immunity substances is very short, and they completely lose their immunity within three weeks after being injected into the body.</p>
<p>(2) Active Immunity The production of active immunity substances occurs when the tissues and cells in the human body interact with Infection, and they must produce a special resistance factor to overcome it. Therefore, active immunity substances are all products of the direct struggle between human cells and infection. After these substances are produced, they often exist in human blood vessels and lymph, and when pathogens invade the body, they eliminate them, preventing the human body from being affected in any way.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Two Methods for Inducing Active Immunity <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>1. Artificial Inoculation This method is applied to healthy people by inoculating the human body with pathogens that have been carefully processed to be less harmful, so as to make a gentle invasion of the human body and avoid the heavy blow of an epidemic infectious disease. For example, the (human pox) used before the invention of cowpox is one example.</p>
<p>2. Vaccination This method involves injecting an antigen to stimulate body tissues to produce resistance factors.</p>
<p>The antigen used for vaccination can be a diluted or limited living germ, such as the smallpox vaccine. Dead bacteria and their toxins can also be used, such as scarlet fever antitoxin serum.</p>
<p>As for epidemic patients who have recovered, they generally no longer develop the disease afterwards because the patient's body, after the natural struggle with the bacteria, has stored a large amount of resistance factors.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Foreign protein is different from the protein originally in the human body. It is toxic to the human body and is mostly an organism that invades from the outside.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Discussion on Social Reform - The Prerequisite for Revitalizing National Goods <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>▲Advocate Joint Operations</p>
<p>The failure of national goods factories in the past, although caused by various reasons, was mostly due to jealousy among competitors, ultimately leading to mutual destruction, accounting for seventy or eighty percent.</p>
<p>If an industry is profitable, one person creates it, and a hundred people follow suit. Given the vastness of China's territory, it would not be a problem if a hundred people produced in a hundred different places. Even if that is not the case, with you in the west and me in the east, and a hundred different sales locations, it would not be impossible. However, they prefer to gather in one corner and compete in one corner, leading to mutual jealousy! Competitive selling! Price reductions! Changing materials! Skimping on labor! Poor quality products, no one cares, until mutual destruction occurs. Foreigners often mock the Chinese people for being accustomed to internecine strife, and this seems to confirm it.</p>
<p>Our country is a country with backward production. In recent years, the production volume of industrial products in the country is two-fifths of the consumption volume. However, the material progress of society is advancing rapidly. The urgent need of the people for industrial products can be imagined. Various countries even regard our country as a dumping ground for goods. If we use national goods for the adoption of the people, if they are cheap and of good quality, we only need to worry about demand exceeding supply, and not worry about supply exceeding demand. In such a large China, there are many sales channels. Why compete in one corner and insist on mutual destruction?</p>
<p>When the snipe and the clam fight, the fisherman benefits. Watching millions and billions of dollars go across the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, alas, people come with goods, and we go with money. People come with money, and we go with national sovereignty. Who is really doing this, who is causing this? This is the misfortune of our country's industry and commerce in the past, and it is also the greatest misfortune for the future of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>In fact, our country's manufacturing industry today is still in the stage of competitive manufacturing and has not yet reached the stage of competitive selling. They do not focus on making sturdy and durable products, striving for excellence to last for a long time, but want to sell self-righteous and substandard products for a short time. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following two psychological factors:</p>
<p>(1) Shortage of capital, eager to make a profit. (2) Speculative mentality, changing with trends. With these two types of industrialists, the fate of Chinese manufacturing can be known. Therefore, to maintain our country's current factories, we must advocate joint operations. To resist foreign goods and revitalize national goods, we must first advocate joint operations. There are two prerequisites for joint operations:</p>
<p>(A) Restricting production volume.</p>
<p>(B) Estimating standard prices.</p>
<p>First, statistically determine the annual sales volume of goods in the industry. Allocate the total sales volume to the factories in the same industry for separate manufacturing. Then, stipulate the annual increase in production volume to prepare for the need for annual sales growth. Excessive surplus or insufficiency violates the principle and should be punished. However, the method of allocating production volume is extremely difficult. A slight lack of fairness will cause complaints to arise. Let me tentatively suggest the following methods:</p>
<p>(1) Determine the production volume based on the size of the capital.</p>
<p>(2) Use the average sales volume of each factory in the recent three years as the standard for the factory's production volume in the future.</p>
<p>Factories have different talents, and social needs are also different. If we insist on using capital as the production standard, it will be difficult to be fair. Moreover, there are historical processes and profit and loss relationships, and there are other issues related to whether the capital can maintain the initial amount. These are all sufficient to make the first method difficult. As for using the average sales volume for one or two years as the standard for future production volume, this is based on facts and is more fair. In addition, estimating the standard prices of goods should first involve inviting industry leaders and experts in the industry to collect various goods from the industry, publicly exhibit them, estimate prices, determine the size of the prices according to the quality of the goods, and determine whether the prices should be increased or decreased in the future. In addition to considering raw material wages and other circumstances, we should also consider the volume of sales to determine whether the prices of certain goods should be increased or decreased, which is also very fair. There are five benefits of joint operations:</p>
<p>(1) It is possible to implement an overall plan. (2) It is possible to concentrate talents and promote sales separately. (3) It is possible to focus on manufacturing. (4) It is possible to deal with customers as a whole. (5) It is possible to avoid meaningless competition, resulting in mutual damage.</p>
<p>In short, it can be said that it is difficult to support oneself alone, and many hands make light work. This is not just the case for joint operations. After the operation is combined, the first thing to do is to engage in division of labor manufacturing. If an industry has more than ten colors of goods, it is not necessary for one factory to manufacture all of them. The factory that is usually good at manufacturing a certain color should be responsible for specializing in that product. The industry is skilled in one, one is specialized, specialized is familiar, familiar is fast, fast is more, and the output is more, the cost will be reduced accordingly. However, in addition to being responsible for manufacturing a certain color of goods that they are good at, they must also be responsible for manufacturing one or two additional colors in order to adjust their sales. The products of each factory are different, but social needs are sometimes the same. Therefore, there are times when product A sells well and product B is sluggish. Product A is bound to make a profit and product B will lose money. Starting with profit and ending with harm greatly violates the original purpose of the union. Now, if they also manufacture other types of goods, it is unlikely that several types of goods will sell well at the same time, or be sluggish at the same time. In short, after joint operations, factories in the same industry will share blessings and difficulties, coexist and prosper, advance and retreat together, so as not to waste this unity. Furthermore, it is possible to cooperate in raw materials and consumption, which are all within the possible scope, but they are not related to the main topic, so they should be discussed separately.</p>
<p>The benefits of joint operations have been mentioned above, but there are also disadvantages. Factories have been competing for a long time, and once they reconcile and turn hostility into friendship, it is like returning soldiers after a war, with the sole aim of seeking peace, thinking that there are no strong enemies outside and that they can leisurely enjoy the remaining years. The quality of the products remains the same, with no improvement at all. At the same time, they regard their industry as hereditary, monopolizing one side, and because of the lack of competition in the industry, they are slow and impolite to customers, thinking that if they are needed, who else is there but me. However, these are all personal educational relationships and cannot be said to be the harm of joint operations. Although these are the words of the author's excessive worry, they are also things that may happen. I sincerely hope that these words are not true.</p>

<p>▲Criminal Instruction: Zi Changqing's petition for bail and letters are all noted. Immediately find a reliable shop guarantor to come to the court for investigation and decision. This is the instruction. ▲Zhang Guiren's request for investigation is noted. The actual fact of whether there is adultery between your wife Zhang Wangshi and Sun Yungui lacks evidence, and there is no need to report it. Furthermore, regarding Pan Jiaozhi's guarantee responsibility and relationship, or any intentional act of allowing the criminal to escape, it does not comply with the provisions of Article 170, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law regarding the escape of prisoners arrested according to law. The request is difficult to approve due to misunderstanding. This is the instruction. ▲Yu Zizhang's petition to claim the girl is noted. Immediately ask the girl's relatives to come to the court to claim her. This is the instruction. ▲Jiang Zhilin's petition is noted. After investigating the defendants' residence, file a lawsuit to summon them for investigation and handling. This is the instruction. ▲Chen Youxin's petition is noted. If the civilian has a dispute with his concubine Li, he can file a lawsuit according to law. The statement stating that a prior declaration is baseless and should not be discussed.

If the defendants do have illegal acts, immediately report and send the case for investigation and handling. This is the instruction. ▲Chen Bingyao's request to summon the case for legal action is noted. This case clearly belongs to a civil dispute and does not raise criminal issues. This court has already issued a clear instruction in the case. The request is highly misunderstood and difficult to approve. This is the instruction. (Above are from August 4th)</p>
<p>▲Civil Instruction: Song Ruyong's petition to disown the father-son relationship with Song Ruisheng and request for filing is noted. There is no legal provision allowing the disownment of the father-son relationship, so it is not appropriate to summon the case as requested. This is the instruction. ▲Shi Er's petition to prevent local bullies from defrauding and request permission to hand them over at any time is noted. If the petitioner operates according to the rules, how can others hinder him? If others have illegal acts, he can report or accuse them in time. Why must the petitioner hand them over? The request is not approved, and the permit is returned. This is the instruction. ▲Shen Jincai's petition to disown the relatives with Shao Yiqiao and request for filing is noted. Relatives are a kind of title, and there is no disownment. However, since Shao Yiqiao has issued a statement declaring that he will no longer have any borrowing or dispute with the petitioner, it is temporarily approved to be filed for future reference.</p>
<p>▲Criminal Instruction: ▲Mao Guisheng's petition is noted. A letter has already been sent to the Public Security Bureau to inform the First Section of the Fourth District. This is the instruction. ▲Li Chunlin's request for arrest is noted. This case has already been investigated due to the implication relationship and the disposition of non-prosecution has been legally served. Now, the request for arrest is not in accordance with legal procedures and is difficult to approve. This is the instruction. ▲Fang Guoshi's lawsuit against Fang Zhengtai for hindering freedom is noted. If Fang has forced a marriage, the woman can report to the local police to bring the case for legal action. This is the instruction. (Above are from August 5th)</p>
<p>▲Civil Instruction: Zhang Wangshi's petition to pursue debt is noted. If the debt is not paid by the deadline after the case has been summoned and pursued, a strict execution is approved. This is the instruction. ▲Hong Jinpu's petition for pursuit is noted. The request is approved.

Wait for the case to be summoned for execution. This is the instruction. ▲Ye Yongsheng's petition to continue execution is noted. The debtor has already paid the remaining debt in full. Bring the mediation record to the court at 9 a.m. on the 12th of this month to claim the case completion. This is the instruction. ▲Ye Pengyuan's petition to seize is noted. The first and second defendants in this case, Yuan Gongxin, have successively paid 80 yuan, which will be issued at 10 a.m. on the 9th of this month. The request to pay the remaining debt within a limited time is temporarily postponed. This is the instruction. ▲Hua Yude's petition to execute the remaining debt is noted. Wait for continued execution. This is the instruction. ▲Zhu Zhushi's petition for execution is noted. Wait for the case to be summoned for execution. This is the instruction. ▲Yao Ajiang's petition to appoint is noted. The appointment is approved. This is the instruction. ▲Jiang Zi's petition to seize is noted. The amount owed in this case is not much. Wait for the summons to summon and recover it. The request is temporarily postponed. This is the instruction. (Above are from August 6th)</p>
