<h3 id="c1">國聯調查團報告書之價値　下梓 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>調查報告之第二使命。爲考慮中日爭議之可能的解决辦法。其第九第十兩章。即就完成此種使命之立塲而敷陳者。李頓爵士等之此項陳。先之以解决問題之原則。繼之以適當解决之條件。最後乃向國聯行政院提出其建議。本文即依此程序而評駡之。</p>
<p>東北事件。爲甲國以武力襲佔乙國領土。並由甲國以武力分化乙國政治主權完整之事件。此本有顯著之事實。昭示於世界。母庸辨析而自明者。乃報告書必欲以」此案旣非此國對於彼國不先利用國際聯合會盟約所定和平處理之機會而遽行宣戰之事件亦非此一鄰國以武力侵犯彼一鄰國邊界之簡單案件」等詞句。斷言問題之複雜。更另以一節陳述滿洲情况非他地所可比擬。吾人倘就報告原文。去其外交修辭而爲赤裸裸之觀察。則日本人所主張之特殊問題。赫然現於紙面。李頓爵士所深悉之「一切事實及其歷史背景。」竟將中國之領士主權問題。完全掩蔽。原則之基本如此。無怪其浪費筆墨於日方解釋之叙述。無怪其認恢復舊狀爲非解决辦法。更無怪其雖明言維持僞組之不適當終不得不爲變相之維持。及其顯明承認滿洲在日本經濟發展上之重要性。欲以抵貨運動不再發生。求中日經濟之接近。並特别注意國際利益與蘇聯利益。而全部原則之眞正意義。始透露於吾人之前。李頓爵士等認定（一）日本需要經濟出路。而可廣大可靠之市塲。須在亞洲。尤其在中國。始能獲得。（二）此市場中列强重大利益。亟應維持。甚至蘇聯利益。亦不容忽視。（三）至於中國。則只須使之鞏固與近代化。生活程度抬。高貿易興奮。市塲購買力增加。吾人就此三點。認淸此項原則之原。則則立於中國人之地位。以空言估量報告書之價値。自知其將不免爲世界明達所竊笑。復次。試觀察依上述原則而來之所謂適當解决條件。報告書所列條件十項。前四項係關於各方利益者。乃於第一項「適合中日雙方之利益」以外。第四項更重言以「承認日本在滿洲之利益。」是無異表示日本利益之可掩蓋中國利益矣。五六兩項爲「樹立中日間之新條約關係。」「解决將來之有效辦法。」容於討論其所建議之辦法時併論之。第七頂「滿洲自治。」則使吾人細讀其解説之文句後。不得不發生一重大之疑問滿洲之須自治。原因在於其曾經被人侵佔乎抑在於各方利益之關係乎。日人所製造之僞獨立運動。可用作改變中國行政組織之根據乎。大多數愛國義軍之活動。其意旨可以一筆抺殺之乎。使此項自治運動而爲眞正大　住民所發起。吾人不欲反對。若以國際勢力造成之自治。無論如何。爲全中國人民所不能承認。困此。其第八條件。亦只能適合於日軍之撤退。日軍撤退而地方原狀恢復。始可談秩序問題與安全問題。此亦定不易之程序也。第九條件之中日間經濟愶調。提出於今日。示免時機過早。其第十「以國際合作促進中國之建設。」其最後之説明。爲以暫時的國際合作。促進中國之内部建設。而其起首之説明。則有「中國政府之不穩定。旣爲中日友好这障礙。及爲其他各國所關懹。遠東和平之維持。旣爲有關國際之事件。而上述辦法。双非待中國具有强有力之中央政府時。不能實現」等語。此使中國人民讀之。不能不肌膚起粟。寒顫而不敢道謝矣。</p>
<p>調查團向國聯行政院提出之建議。欲以顧問會議。造成（一）治理東三省之特殊制度。（二）中國對日屈服之三種條約。此所謂特殊制度。其性質及組織。具如報告書所述。凡讀報告書者。均加以注意而有相當之明瞭。中國對日應訂立之三種條約。其内容所應規定之日本利益。建議中亦全爲之作具體的説明。不必有所贅述。吾人就此加以審察以後。所欲問者。爲（一）此種特殊制度之眞正意義何在。蓋如所建議之制度。不啻改變僞組織之形式。而使成爲合法的存在。並於許多操縱現在東北政權之日顧問中加入若干西籍顧問。中國則宣言承認實際管理權。換得名義上之領土行政完整及若干税欵之收入。依吾人觀察。决非眞正解决爭端之道也。（二）將來東北之實際勢力之爲何人所握持。蓋於現在日人勢力下訓練特别憲兵。其結果亦必爲現在僞滿洲軍之變相。於眞正特别憲兵之作用。必難有外國教練官。亦不過現在僞組織之西顧問之類耳。（三）中國對日三種條約之訂立。如所擬議。是否合於中日經濟合作之意義。蓋中國旣以條約承認。並讓予日本以廣大之權利。並須負阻遏抵制日貨運動之責任。而中國所得。幾等於零。以此言經濟合作。直等貓鼠間之合作耳。</p>
<p>最後。吾人於調查團全部報告。作一總評。可斷言其欲以國際複雜之關係。附以日人所造成之旣存事實。代替中國之收回東三省失地。所謂兩國爭議之審查。兩國根本利益之調和。不過掩蔽廬同眞面之外交修辭耳。</p>

<p>國民社二日華盛頓電美國對於李頓調查報告之正式意見尙須待國務卿史汀生詳細研究該報告之後方能表示史氏可望於今日自費府回京立即開始審閲現據接近政府者之非正式評論以爲該報告對於滿洲時局有廣大而超異的客觀研究料可有裨於獲致中日俱能滿意之解决辦法美官塲中人曾詳細研究該報告者見其維持九國公約與非戰公約切實援用於滿洲問題皆覺欣慰並謂其中保全中國領土與行政完整之建議與美國見解恊調而其承認日本在滿洲有重要特殊利益亦爲任何最後解决所不可少者</p>
<p>國民社二日華盛頓電今日美國務卿史汀生先召國務院遠東司長　佩克對於李頓調查報告有所商榷嗣兩人即與國務院其他要員共同詳細研究報告内容史氏在研究完畢前不願表示意見但聞美政府高級官員認此報告對於解决滿洲問題供給闊大而令人滿意之工作基礎其將俄國在滿利益一併叙入一層更多認爲目光遠大可爲調查團抱有欲使滿洲永久和平志願之明證又有若干熟悉國際情事者則認此報告對於中日兩國毫無頗袒同樣公平且可證明調查團抱有剛强之志願欲令滿洲在形體上在民旅上爲中國所保有但同時對於日本利益供給相當保護總之在美京無有認此報告與美國政策相背馳者云</p>
<p>國民社二日華盛頓電美官塲對於李頓報告表示滿意但一般注重實際者則覺欲令其中建議見　實施尙多困難因料日本必將反對建議中許多條目尤其對於不駐兵之議此間消息靈通者對於日本願否同意撤盡所駐軍隊層深爲懷疑又關於廢除傀儡國代以名義上服從南京之新政府亦料日本未必能允從此間意見以爲欲使日本贊同李頓建議之唯一希望厥在其感覺應付滿洲義勇軍之棘手而已因欲撲滅此項義勇軍需費浩繁當在此用兵時期在經濟方面收益極微殊不足以償付此長期之鉅額支出也</p>
<p>路透三日紐約電紐約各報華盛頓訪員　皆以爲美國務院雖對李頓報告書尙未予以批評但顯然擬用美政府之勢力贊助李頓動　等所提出關於和平解决滿案之建議華盛頓官員視報告書審量大局殊爲公正且爲排難解紛之實在的途徑據可靠消息傳負責方面之意見美政府目下對於此事不欲作任何行動以爲此事現由代表多數國之機關加以調查則美國唯一適當途徑乃靜待國聯之行動耳紐約時報今日載有社説評論報告書稱爲包含豐富鞭辟入裏持論公允又謂報告書示明渴望中日兩國從事和解及列强彼此合作以助中國脱離内戰之禍害而建設穩固之政府云</p>
<p>路透二日紐約電紐約講壇報稱日本不待李頓報告書之發表遽即承認「滿洲國」實鑄一大錯東三省自治而不駐兵得中國之同意與國際之好意從策略點觀之較諸永遠武力佔據招地方之反抗中國之惡　與國際之疑忌者實有更大之價値云</p>

<p>▲路透社三日東京電今日各報皆注意於李頓報告書他事皆不遑顧及而皆一致表示不滿惟一般語氣尙和緩耳</p>
<p>▲電通三日東京電關於李頓報書東京朝日新聞本日著社説論之曰支配調查團委員之頭腦者不問事態如何始終以撤兵論爲本旨所謂國聯理論而已陷於自已所稱「蔑視實現者」之誤而已至於解决之主義與條件提唱國際協力尤爲蔑視歷史之空言如此之解决意見試問有何權威</p>

<p>縱與國聯絶緣在所不恤</p>
<p>▲路透社三日東京電外務省發言人今晨聲稱日政府對於李頓報告書之未數章擬約略涉及蓋「滿洲國」業經承認無庸再詳細評論也日本之意見書約二三星期内可以草成</p>
<p>▲電通社三日東京電有企圖審判遠東問題之觀之調查團報告書於昨午後九時公表日政府當局以該報告書之内容過於失當且有逸出調查團本來使命範圍以外之點决提出意見書於十一月四日之國聯理事會加以精細之反駁當局已設置外務陸軍聯合委員會着手起草據聞日政府對意見書之方針大抵如下（一）調查團之使命如去年十二月十日國聯理事會之决議對國聯總會無法律的拘束力僅提供參考資料而已希望國聯方面不爲報告書所拘束適應現地之新事態謀適當之解决（一）報告書第一章·第二章·第三章·第七章·及第八章係紀述事實大抵可無異議惟第四章記述九一八以後之滿洲事態第五章記述上海事變第六章記述滿洲國爲日政府所不能承認（一）第九章關於解决之主張與條件及第十章之結論認爲已承認「滿洲國」爲獨立國家之日本政府所不能加以何等考慮者尤以不承認滿洲國之自主的發生與長成而於國際敎官協力之下以組織憲兵隊爲條件設立非武裝地帶之主張爲完全越出調查團使命以外之提案日政府絶對不能承認（一）日政府雖無自動誘致最惡事態以謀脱退聯盟之意然聯盟方面苟繼續其認識不足則有與聯盟絶緣對遠東問題照自主獨往的解决策邁進之用意此則不可不聲明者</p>
<p>▲路透社三日東京電日本一般人士之意見謂李頓報告書所載關於解决滿案之建議如在半年前提出則必可爲日本接受但今日新國之獨立業已告成實無接受之可能矣又此間官員以爲國聯最上之策厥爲忍待二三年使「滿洲國」有證明其能力與安全之機會國聯在此期限滿後即可决定在中國之下自治或逕自獨立二者孰佳尤其因中政府本身亦不穩固云</p>

<p>▲電通三日東京電民政黨對報告書發表聲明如下李頓報告書表示可驚異之無理解中國之中央政府無統治滿洲之實力爲顯著之事實故滿洲爲馬賊橫行及赤化運動之策源地而李頓委員會乃欲便無統治能力者復歸於主權者之地位則國内的國際的將使滿洲再化爲動亂之巷而已云云</p>

<p>謂能兼顧法律事實</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社二日日内瓦電巴黎時報特派通訊員稱國聯會負責人員以爲李頓報告書於法律與事實均能兼顧例如説明滿洲國非居民之自動組織主張維持中國在滿洲之主權皆爲就法律立論之點至於事實上則日本在滿洲之權利報告書完全承認日本權利確被破壞報告書亦一再説明並提出一種可以解决方案主張中日兩國在一定領土範圍之内密切合作在此領土上中國有其主權其行政爲自治而日本在此境内之特殊權利亦須全承認至於滿洲境内之各外國權利則調查團結論主張維持門户開放主義此則均就事實立言者也</p>
<p>▲國民社三日日内瓦電國聯中人對於李頓報告感想殊微有評論調查團建議不啻放棄履行國聯之義務與諾言者以爲關於盟約第十欵保證各會員國領土完全完整一層此種情形尤爲顯著並恐若干小國欲免造成對於自己最危險之先例起見將竭力反對所擬解决辦法但亦有以爲吾人不能預斷日本定當違犯國聯原則故日本雖照調查團計劃可在滿洲獲極大之勢力範圍而仍不贊成將滿洲如斯國際化要亦無深異總之此間觀察時事者咸視國聯今後討論李頓報告時易於在日本與列强間引起一極複雜與困難之談判云</p>
<p>▲路透二日日内瓦電衆料李頓報告書所條陳之顯問會議其範圍已明白規定故中國前所反對與日本直接談判一點當可銷滅至於報告書中所載之各項條陳衆意日未必不依允撤退除憲兵外之所有武裝軍隊亦未必依允完全變更東三省之現狀而使東三省在中國主權與行政完整中實行自治新制度一般意思以爲此報告書乃國聯主持下團體所發表之最可注意文件叙事立言審愼溫和</p>
<p>文字亦雅顯有英人風格察其詞句似處處皆爲李頓手筆但其中有數處係後來插入者顯然可見此報告書可視爲指斥日人之作</p>
<p>▲國際電信社二日日内瓦電昨日星期日有世界各國訪員數百人聚集於國聯新聞記者室中靜候李頓報告書之公佈人人均認此項報告書有極重大之關係蓋報告書中有數千言均係指責日本軍國主義并判斷九一八之夜日本軍人藉口自衛行動奪取瀋陽之不當報告書内要求日軍退出滿洲一節可在各小國中得强有力之後援因彼等懼日本此種行動將爲人效尤而致危及其自身他日之獨立及安全也又法總理赫　歐所取之態度已形成日内瓦一致之輿論據赫氏云法國對於中國日本并不作左右袒但歐洲必須在遠東維持國聯盟約及各種條約此不僅國聯利益攸關即世界和平亦有大影響</p>
<p>▲路透三日日内瓦電　　各界現有以其餘暇從容研究李頓報告書之機會故今可更完全及由更廣大之角度發表其意見雖第一印象似皆表示報告書全不利於日本而維護中國方面但目下之意見頗多歧異此不可不承認者例如波蘭各界謂報告書之决議就其前提而論微近牽强或太迂廻彼等以爲調查團所蒐集之證據固極有助於日方而其决議則反不利於日本報告書已示明中國現非處於能恢復治安或改組以復常狀之地位彼等又謂調查團且承認恢復東三省舊日之局勢爲不可能而亦有謂承認日本特殊之經濟與財政利益即證明其特殊行動之正當者其他歐洲各方面之意見以爲報告書或可爲協同解决之基礎尤其爲根據以自治權給與滿洲新政府之條件云惟大多數之意見視報告書爲根據審愼完備客觀的調查所擬定之莊重而合實際的計畫示明日本雖在經濟上與安全上有正當之觖望但除根據中國主權而外實無從覔得解决方法云</p>

<p>▲路透二日巴黎電法人對於李頓報告書之批評多措詞愼重態度冷淡自由報謂此報告書未必能解决東三省難題而其所擬之折衷辦法亦未必能提高國聯之聲望辯論報謂撰此報告書者鑄一錯誤旣須變更現狀而又承認「滿洲國」之不可免如新邦之獨立旣成問題則「滿洲國」當局未必允參加調查團所提議之會議云</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯社二日巴黎電晨報撰文評論李頓報告書稱「報告書中有一要點立能引起注意要點爲何曰調查團在結論中建議滿洲政府組織應予更改設立一種廣泛自治行政制度務求其適合地方情形及東三省特殊狀態而與中國主權及其行政完整不相抵觸但半月以前日本業已承認滿洲國今欲令其退步不綦難乎」云云</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二日巴黎電「日報」記者聖蒲里士爲文論李頓報告書略云「李頓報告書今日可使國聯準備工作而不致再惹起出而干涉之思想且不致引火自焚而令美國坐收其利吾人由報告書之末端得到一種顯明之教訓即中國人與日本人之事宜聽其自行解决蓋雙方均宜於自行妥恊彼此之爭執若由國際參加反足增其熱烈程度」聖蒲里士又謂李頓報告於中日兩國之間力爲持平之論但其結論云「報告書不免有矛盾處一方旣謂中國應完全自主他方復認爲應受監護此其一旣言中日兩國絶對不能融洽又以爲兩國應互相妥協此其二總而論之報告書中有一種證明顯而易見即恢復舊日狀况爲不可能耳」云云</p>

<p>眞正能夠養成健全國民和增加生産能力的小學是多多益善的因爲這種小學出來的學生决不會成爲失業游民的現在的小學許多是私立的大多數是縣立的省立的是很少國立的是絶無了許多人以爲國家應該注重高級敎育初級敎育應該讓地方或私人辦理我以爲國家固然應該注重高級敎育而對於初級敎育尤其要注重因爲小學是敎育的基礎也就是政治社會一切的基礎小學辦得不好敎育固然糟政治社會也决不爲好起來的尤其是在中國要達到普及國民敎育的目的决非地方或私人財力所能勝任所以國家和省年都應該撥給大宗欵項來補助市縣或私人所辦的小學這種欸項並且每年要增加定出期限到那時國民敎育一定要眞正普及其他機關可以裁併政費可以緊　惟有這筆欸絶對不應省不可以省因爲這是中國將來命脈的寄的事業</p>
<p>中級敎育這一個階段應該包括生産師資和預備人才的敎育中級敎育與初級敎育不同初級敎育只有一種學校就是小學中級敎育可以分做三種不同性質的學校一種是職業學校偏重生産敎育一種是師範學校偏重師資敎育一種是中學校偏重預備人才敎育</p>
<p>中國敎育家提倡職業敎育也提倡了十幾年了各省職業學校也辦了不少了但是成效如何呢可以説大部分是失敗因爲旣然呌做職業學校那牠第一個要義就是要使畢業的學生能夠生産有正當的職業但是現在職業學校的學生畢業出來一部份家境較好的就去升學大多數是加入了社會上失業的隊伍裏終日皇皇如也的找工作一小部分有工作的也與他們在學校所受的敎育毫不相干臂如工業學校畢業的學生并不做工而在小學裏做敎員農業學校畢業的學生并不耕田而在機關裏做事務員或書記那種眞正學那一行而出來做那一行事的人恐怕百十不得一照如此現象看來過去的職業學校還能説不是大失敗嗎我們研究職業學校失敗的原因第一是爲每一個職業學校開辦之先主持的人很少有精密地計劃社會需要的是那一種人職業學校應該養成的是那一種人而只是泛泛地依他的直覺從事他覺得中國農業不發展就辦一種農業學校他覺得中國工業不發達就辦一個工業學校結果是學校造出來的人社會無所用之而社會所需要的人學校反没有造就第二是現在的職業學校和其他學校一樣注重在書本上的研究而忽略了實用的技能農業學校的學校坐在講堂裏聽敎員講如何如何的畊出工業學校的學生坐在講堂裡聽敎員講如何如何的做工這樣的敎育卽便學生十二分地用功結果也是造成廢物我參觀過好幾個職業學校親自看見農業學校將畢業的學生的插的秧歪歪斜斜不成行列遠不及一個未受敎育的農夫所種工業學校將畢業的學生所製的本器粗劣異常遠不及一個未受敎育的工人所製這種樣的農業學校工業學校不論辦上多少於中國的農業農工業固然不生影響對於學生個人也决不能帮助他做一個生産份子要矯正這些毛病我主張職業學校第一不必分農工商等科而應該分許多不同的班社會上需要那一種人就開那一種班社會上所不需要的就不去造就第二職業學校不必呆板規定畢業年限爲三年四年或五年完全看訓練某一種生産技能所需要的時間而定修業時期的長短甲種職業只需要三個月的訓練學生三個月就可以畢業乙種職業也許需要半年丙種職業也許需要兩年丁種也許需要五年六年甚至於同一職業甲想學精一點就要一年的時間乙只要粗學一點就只要半年的時間第三職業學校應該絶對注重技能的訓練書本傳授還在其次因爲職業學校的目的本來是造就生産份子而不是養成專門人才普通生産所最需要是實用技能而不是原理原則所以職業學校的學生對於原理原則知道得少還不要緊若是缺乏生産技以那是根本失了職業學校的意義了</p>

<h3 id="c97">假如甘地在中國 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 景記</p>
<p>本市擁護國聯盟約委員會，來函敦促相老人就任名譽委員；因爲信中提及仿甘地的不合作運動，相老人就這樣對我談過：</p>
<p>假如甘地在中國，他將怎樣來救中國呢？　　那所謂不合作運動，就有改變方法的必要了？理由我將分兩層告訴你；不過説來説去，又像俗語：三句話不離本行！</p>
<p>一是國民信仰問題你要明瞭，宗教力量，可以化民成俗，可以團結民心。甘地在印度很信仰宗教；一般印度民衆，奉他爲一位虔誠的宗敎家：所以他這種人格，便足彀號召民衆。你想：愛爾蘭也是同樣的對英要求自主，現在已經恢復了自主；因爲愛爾蘭人大多數是信奉天主敎的！甘地對於信仰薄弱的中國人他的舉動便抢吸引同情的効力；故此要另行設法才妥。</p>
<p>二是本地民俗問題我國地廣民衆，南北風氣各别：東北被日蹂躏，西南態度如常；上海抗日戰事劇烈，天津日貨反而暢旺。説來是很羞恥的：跪哭團的涕泣叩頭，奸商們的良心何嘗覺悟：甘地對這麻木不仁的中國人，非另想個妙計策不可！</p>
<p>甘地如果眞生在中國，像我活到九十多歲時，洞悉我民情風俗，希望能同我合作：講天條十誡救正人心，倡地方保甲實行自治。欒城論民政文，説古來用三老嗇夫譏誚教誨本鄕郡的不肖份子；現若提倡人民自治，奸商也就逃不了鄰里鄕黨的公判！』</p>
<h3 id="c98">傷内禍 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 阿紅</p>
<p>從太平天國説起</p>
<p>太平天國之亡，其致命傷在内禍，讀了石達開的詩，眞教人扼腕歎息！然而這也並非偶然：想那一羣草莽英雄，原爲自己創業，説什麽弔民伐罪，只不過宣傳宣傳藉資號召而已，那裏是眞的！所以，一朝得勢，便醇酒婦人，爭權奪利！爲了私怨幽憤，雖禍國殃民，亦所不恤！勝利大權獨操，敗則光棍來還是光棍去，這有什麽不可以！不過這在八十年前，天下本是一姓一家的，成王敗寇，自無與小民，然而現在可不同了：主子是我們四萬萬人！就是：操莽再世，也必曰：我是公僕！我是爲民前驅的！</p>
<p>可是，我國現在的内禍，已甚於太平天國了！而外患呢，更是那時所没有的！以前，民衆不知有權可使，現在我們有權，却老是不使，豈不可嘆！</p>
<p>同胞們！可别再甘作瘟神阿斗，縮着頭咬着牙，死撑活挨了！老實不</p>
<p>客氣執行主人權柄吧！我們馬上來個急急如律令令我們的公僕：</p>
<p>一，你們如尙覺還是我們公僕的話，就應立刻停止内戰，同到疆邊，槍口一致對外！</p>
<p>一，你們若偏要對自家好勇鬭很，那就請們立刻卸下公僕招牌，去到馬戲塲，鬥牛塲，或自己立個擂臺！儘管顯身手，打碼頭！可不要打着我們旗號，來糟塌我們！　　男女同胞：醒醒吧！再不制裁：威風，他們自逞完了爲止，可是，亡國奴的慘痛，他們不能替你代分受的呵！</p>

<p>— 邱肇偉</p>
<p>這時代是我們的</p>
<p>張老頭説：「天凉了，這些光着腿瓜兒在街上走的女人，也該把襪子穿上了吧？我説：「不，便是在冬天，襪子　穿了。因爲即使是老太婆，腿上也未必會生起凍凔來呵。」</p>
<p>「連大腿也光了，將屁股在旗袍裏掩映着擺動，幾乎要不穿褲子，這算什麽」</p>
<p>「但是，倘没有相當的健康美和靑春的血色，也决不願意給暴露着的。</p>
<p>娘兒們最要緊是胸脯，肚皮和臀部。怎樣使它自由發展，充實，又怎樣使它顯露，都是要緊的。就是説要自然美姿態，要曲線的波動，」</p>
<p>「黑黃色棕色的皮膚也算美豈不就是誘惑肉感不穿褲子的意思？若是從窰子裏跑出來的，或是街頭的賣淫婦，也没什麽可驚奇，但這些竟是大家閨秀，女學生！堕落呵，不可思議的堕落！我們的道德文化是趨向滅亡的路上了」</p>
<p>「但是，務必請你不要這麽説。因爲是這個時代的緣故呵！説是在大的時代裏，一切都在轉變，在飛躍，説是時代的陔子們，站在尖端，表現活潑的靑春之力，所以作爲女人的，也返於原始的自由的半裸形態了。」</p>
<p>「但是不知爲什麽，總覺得有點憂心。」張老頭説。</p>

<p>— 曹立芳</p>
<p>就爲「小」的當道</p>
<p>本談九前曾發表鳳君『「小」的當道』一文，推究起來，感慨無窮！因爲『「小」的當道』，便造成了「大」的上當的惡果。現在就鳳君所舉的幾個例子中擇要加以申説：</p>
<p>我們中國人的心理尤其是具有「大」字性的。幾乎是普遍的建築在愛「小」的基礎上，試看：「大」人物心最寵愛的不是老婆，而是「小」老婆，但是身爲「小」老婆者却不見得個個能夠竉愛於「大」人物，而能心心相印，不使情意别注；「大」老官身常居住的不是公館，而是「小」公館，可是「小」公館裏面的嬌娘，却不見得人人顧念其「大」老官的經濟負担，而能生活平民化，以稍減其金屋式的闊綽思想：妓女隊裏『先生之「小」者』，是富有誘惑魔力，尤其能夠使家擁巨産的「大」少們，揮金如土，金盡，則杜門謝客；男朋友中『臉白且「小」者』，是特能動人憐愛，尤其能夠使醉心愛美的「大」家閨秀，一見傾心，身污，則棄之不惜；至於看「小」報的人們的心理，完全誤會看報爲解沉悶而忘却更重大的看報意義，因之「大」報的銷路不免受了相當影響，以致我國的新聞事業在國際地位上仍是落後！</p>
<p>説到國家，我們這個「大」中華因爲「小」東隣的『當道』，「大」中華「上當」的結果，直到今日，亡國之禍，迫在眉睫！我們豈可再不覺悟，還是抱定固有的愛「小」的心理，覺得他小東隣，「小「得可憐，「小」得可愛，而不思稍改其劣根性和這對我國仇對世公敵的「小」東隣决一死戰嗎？（不受酬）</p>

<p>— 求幸福主</p>
<p>「哦！一貞，你究竟來了啊」他猛地跳起來，握住他身後那來人的手，急切的再問：我多候一刻兒不打什麽緊，只想著你昨日約我四點半在此叙談，决不會無故失信的平白地老不來，定是發生了什麽意外的事，我是在這兒替你擔憂犯悉啊！</p>
<p>説過那幾句話後，這靑年緊握住了來人的手還不肯放，并集中了眼神對來人仔細端詳看個不歇。來人是個女性，穿著魚白色竹布女短褂，繫一條靑胡縐短裙子，白色長統線襪，黑皮鞋，是一個極樸素的女學生。頭上已剪了髮，额前有一圈很整齊的短髮掩　到眼臉邊，像是西洋幼女的樣子，一對黑漆精圓的眼珠，懸膽般的鼻，子蘋果式天然紅白臉，也完全顯出是個二九年華天眞爛漫的小姑娘。只是在伊這黃金時代，應該是快樂活潑的，此時却不知怎的，竟露出些憂鬰的神色。</p>
<p>這姿容和神色上的一切，彼他驟然之間就看了個很透澈，忍不住又追著問道：「咬呀你現在氣色很不好；我料得不虚，準是你在家庭中又遇了什麽橫逆了。别憋在心上，快告訴我」　　這個女郎低　了聲，徐徐以極幽細的聲音訴答：「伯勤，你猜得對；我這極孤苦極不幸的命運上，現時又遇到一個極嚴重的變端呢。我的身世，你本來全知道的。我是一個無交無母的孤女，依著我叔叔過活，立志不想多倚頼他們，極力要求得一點學問，練成一些技能，自己打開一條出路，謀一個獨立的職業，就是平日遭叔嬸們一些白眼，受點子悶氣，都以爲是暫時的無關緊要的磨難，遲早總可以避免開的，無妨委屈忍受，得過且過。但今天所遇到的事情，却不是那樣尋常和簡單了！我叔嬸對於我却偏要執行什麽親　，主持我的婚姻大事；我那嬸嬸更壞，是一個出身於娼門中最刁惡最勢利的婦人，迷惑住叔叔，説是替他到外面　營作宫的門路，成天成夜的到外面與一般官眷應酬交際，大闊人的家裏伊巴結不進，盡與一些大軍人的副官馬弁們來往。</p>

<p>舉世注目之李頓調查團報告書旣已公布各國與論遂亦紛紛評　其價値本報記者昨日分訪本埠中外各界領袖人物聽取其對於國聯報告書之意見一部分深思之士以該項報告書文字冗長而含義亦頗費咀嚼須假以時日細心研究方能表示具體意見另一部分不尙空言者注重國人奮發自强積極收回失地認該報告書無裨實際更如伍朝樞所謂解决中日問題唯一有效之武器莫若經濟絶交日使館中人則仍認僞滿洲國萬難取銷茲彙錄各方意見如次</p>
<p>▲伍朝樞之觀察中央委員伍朝樞愽士昨對往訪者談吾人讀報告書第七章知調查團對我國之對日經濟絶交表示不滿據伍觀察調查團之所以如此者實有兩大原因據其屢次出席國聯之經騐深知國際聯合會之習慣向不敢得罪强國李頓報告書中關於爆炸南滿鐵路一節曾謂爆炸鐵路「實不足以證明日軍事行動之正當」又謂「是晚日方之軍事行動不能視爲合法自衛之辦法」更確認「滿洲國」爲日本所造成此皆與日本以重大之打擊於是不得不藉不滿意經濟絶交一點使强横之日本心中稍稍得以舒適此其一經濟絶交在國際立塲言之幾可謂爲中國所發明在中國行之者亦較多但在勞資方面言之經濟絶交之一舉實爲愛爾蘭所首創考「杯葛」之來源實係昔日愛爾蘭一人名此人係一大地主與工人發生糾紛時工人遂設法抵制之因此遂成爲今日甩習用之「抵制」之意現今應用於國際之間遂成爲中國所發明之一種新武器歐美各國對之亦頗畏懼因此國際間對之遂擬加以制裁此其二伍氏繼謂如現在之中國連經濟絶交之武器俱無則中國勢必不能競存於世界彼深信解决中日問題固須以外交手腕利用國聯與國際情勢以及軍隊之抵抗等種種方法然其唯一有效之武器莫若經濟絶交且此尤足表現中華民族之團結伍氏更稱凡一國家其土地喪失後未有不能收回者例如一八七一年法普戰後法國喪失阿爾蕯斯·勞倫·兩省之地於德經四十餘年之久法國卒於一九一九年收復其地此此波蘭亡國歷百數十年之久今尙可整個恢復其獨立自主東北問題祇視國民之努力程度何如耳伍氏最後論及日本之實力謂日本之軍事地位在遠東固可稱雄然其海陸軍仍遜於歐美各國列强兵力雖難以深入遠東但經濟方南實日本之地大弱點英諺所謂「HeelofAcahillos」者出自古希臘之古典成语Achilles係一人名出生以後其交母昕夕望其成仙未幾果有一神仙告其能追隨習練者當能如願旋所謂神仙者將其予提足浸諸河中凡河水所漬全身竟成銅皮鐵骨刀劍不入但不知手提之足踝水未浸着仍係肉質有此弱點結果終創於此日本弱點亦猶此也中國最大力量在經濟欲保持此種力量必須一致團結堅持到底弗專依頼外力之帮助方充有濟</p>
<p>▲英人方面意見記者訪英商　　會會長馬　　　　　　報告書今僅涉　一遇　　　　惟覺此報告書甚屬公平其價値有二一爲前所各執一辭之種種紛爭事實今得此報告書而澄淸一爲中日兩國可由此而獲得談判之基礎如中國接受此報告書而日本拒絶之中國在國際上之地位可更見鞏固英國政府及世界公正人士必擁護此報告書也</p>
<p>▲大美晚報評論大美晚報評　　論報告書云（上略）要之調查團之報告書不能認爲滿洲問題結局其原意亦不在此但確以幹練無偏之方式提出一滿洲事件之提要連新國之組織在内并提議一可行之解决方法并未有認眞新的事物提出是爲眞事眞正之問題猶依然未曾解答也此言固甚簡單但含義則極端複雜此問題即日本是否將堅持離世界而孤立以便追求一種擴張其軍事政治勢力於亞洲大陸而不問受其他任何世界約束决議將語人以日本願付其代價截至現在係願意付者日本是否願意危及其代管之太平洋上德國殖民地乃其所當答之問題之一主要部也吾人</p>
<p>嘗得聞日本寗與世界戰而不肯放棄滿洲此事暫時已不在討論之列對滿洲現已無開戰之問題今日之問題僅爲日本對其所信爲所得之日本操縱之滿洲是否認爲可抵失去在國羣中地位之所費也</p>
<p>▲日人方面態度日使館中人　　稱對於李頓報告書尙無正式意見發表惟謂滿洲國旣已産生不能使其夭亡今日之事惟有實行歐人治歐美人治美及亞人治亞之原則從新做起中日談判滿洲國問題之時機已經過去以後之談判滿洲國問題不在討論之列中國如承認截至今日之現狀進而談判中日將來之關係日本固優爲之云云</p>

<p>記者昨以商務印書館解雇職工在法院控告公司董事要求退俸·退職花紅等欵一案走訪該公司某職員茲誌其談話如下（一）退俸金據云該公司在一二八以前確有一種酬恤章程凡辭退職工均給以若干退職金其數目視其在職年份之長短及其薪給之多寡而定然此項章程祇適用於平時不能應用於非常變故之後且其解釋及修改之權均屬於公司董事會又酬恤金係由公司盈餘項下支撥每年撥入及歷年積存之數作爲酬恤基金即以之應付上項章程中一切支出但章程中載明此項基金仍爲公司所有本年五月該公司奉社會局批示將此項餘存基金完全撥給解雇之職工作最後之救濟該公司勉力遵辦後此頂基金業已支罄矣（二）退職金該公司對於職工除上述酬恤章程之退俸金外並無另給退職金之恊約原告等所據華東製</p>
<p>造廠之先例查華東收歇時公司營業正在發達因同情於一部份被解雇之職工雖曾另送薪水若干但此爲特殊贈與行爲不能援爲先例更不能適用於創深痛鉅之今日且華東事件以後公司解雇職工頗多亦從無照華東加送薪水之事可爲明證至於此次該公司職工解雇時每人亦曾先後多給約有兩個月之薪金然此均出於公司之自動萬無據以訴訟之理（三）花紅該公司上年度結賬展至本年一月底蓋因戰事發生時適値該公司盤貨時間所有貨物簿册全部被燬該公司縱有盈餘至結算時已完全變爲損失况同人分派花紅照公司章程必須股東分有紅利時始有花紅現在該公司財産大部被燬股東股本已減損五分之二自無花紅可言</p>
<p>最後記者復以曾否在香港保有千萬元兵險爲詢據某君笑答云如果保有兵險股東安肯受股本減縮之損失此在稍有智識之人即可辨明無庸置辯</p>

<p>▲江裕過澄招商局江裕輪自漢口下水來滬至十月一日午刻船到江陰照例在對江靖江洋棚前抛停起卸貨客當夜十時二十三分因貨客上落竣事便拔錨起行開駛來滬初開慢車至十時三十分瞥見船身右側有一黑形望之係一未點燈火之船舶抛泊江面頗礙江裕之航行船主以深夜難於認辨即令轉舵向左以避讓該船而期安全通過</p>
<p>▲兩船互撞江裕發覺右舷　有停輪便向左側開快倒車退駛但其時潮水退落至激江裕船首已不及避讓遂與抛錨之輪互撞江裕船主急停輪視察始知停抛者爲海道測量局靑天號測量艦但何以不掛首尾燈火致使釀此撞碰之禍江裕一面停車掉頭一面鳴汽笛下椗至靑天艦會同艦長共同勘騐損傷</p>
<p>▲損壞程度兩船相撞之後江裕船主劉鴻策即至靑天艦訪艦長陳長卿同行視察勘得江裕輪船頭左首之護攔杆木之鋼板約撞壞十尺寬七尺高船頭錨　上鐵板亦被撞破鐵練亦斷幸破洞在水平線上故頭艙幸免浸水面靑天艦之受傷係船頭錨孔鐵板撞灣　　　撞折前艙之旗杆並遭折斷雙方勘明後即行共同簽字證明</p>

<p>▲船主呈報船主於到滬後已將此次相撞情形據實報稱本輪第六次　於十月一日開抵江陰停卸貨客午後十時二十三分開行先走慢車至二十六分停候駁靠本船向左岸豐開勃行駛不意右舷忽見如舢舨之黑物障礙航綫該船且無相當錨燈燃點黑夜之中珠難認辨究爲何項船隻祇得盡量轉向右面不能倒車以落潮甚急遽難應手遂致駛快避免致左首與該船相撞停車察視乃知海道測量局之测量艦靑天云云此事責任問題現尙未能定奪</p>

<p>山東義士梁作友，捐金三千萬元，救濟國難，初次電傳，我疑不確，因在此經濟生産落後的我國，從未聞有山東富商，資産額達七八千萬以上者，我疑千字或十字之誤，不意繼續電傳，確已證實，因此我對於遺産制度未曾打消，權利思想正在發皇的我國，而梁義士能慷慨捐輸，其事之足風，深爲敬佩，自不待言，我也可以不必贅述，</p>
<p>惟據梁義士所表示，該項經濟支配用度，約分三類，以十分之二資助勦匪經費，十分之二救濟失業災民，十分之六，則用以振興實業，就其支配的數量與性質言之，亦頗得救濟國難扼要的標準，</p>
<p>但是我國經濟，素不公開，國家收入與支出，及其用途，人民都是莫名其妙的，甲欵乙用，乙欵丙用，天然在所不免祗要有錢，用了再講，我國經濟，在這樣混亂的狀態之下，成爲習慣，不知梁義士的經濟支配用途，政府是否能順從其旨辦理，還是使人疑問，或者謂梁義士的捐欵，應設一保管委員會，以監督用途，但是此種制度，在我國亦並不適用，即如故宮愽物院，亦有保管委員會之設立，而其結果，仍有盜賣宮古物案件發生，則保管委員會之設立，亦殊無意義也，</p>
<p>梁義士捐助三千萬元，其救濟之目的，雖是如此，但梁義士業已捐輸，則此種經濟，自有政府爲適當的支配，梁義士不過行其我心之所安，原可無容顧問，而疑慮到善後方策矣，</p>

<p>無論西藥，理化藥品，工業藥品，及化妝品，香精，等。如固有揮發性的有吸收性的東西。貯在瓶中。雖則已竟用了玻璃塞成軟木塞。但是仍舊不妥當的。必須再加一種固封的物品。這種物品種類很多。各就其性質和物價高低的不同。用相宜的物品去固封譬如有吸收性的東西。可用普通的物品去封固。假使有揮發性或是有燃燒性的物質。就不能不小心了。因爲普通的固封物。如火漆，拍拉賓等。都要用火去鎔。一不小心。就有危險。固口物這東西。雖然是很小的。有但是用度倒也很廣。現在我來分别地談談。</p>
<p>普通的固封物</p>
<p>這種固封物大概都是用在有吸收性的物品。如礦物性鹽類。以及價廉而無燃燒性的物品等。等牠的主要製品。如火漆，是松脂化合物。拍那賓（Faraffn）是煤油中提出來的礦蠟等。可先用火鎔化變爲流質。再澆在瓶口上。這種很普通的東西。大概都已知道。不用多説了。</p>
<p>特用的固封物</p>
<p>這種封口物。是用在貯有揮發性或燃燒性物質的瓶口上。又價昻的藥品。或是要外表美觀的商業品。也必須用這類封口物。牠的種類很多。都須加以製造。並非天然生成。所以要分别説明如下。但是限於篇幅。只好舉了兩種。</p>
<p>（一）膠棉封口物牠的原料是哥羅弟恩。（Eollodion）哥羅弟恩的製法是膠棉（Tolubbpyroxylin）用以脱（Etoet）溶解。成爲揉厚的溶液瓶口塗了這種液質。不數分鐘就能凝結成爲透明薄層。附着在瓶口上。如要美麗。可用各種顔料。預先加入哥羅弟恩的液體中。如市上各種化妝香品的瓶口。比較價貴的都有這種固封物包在瓶口。牠的好處就是不用火去溶化所以不會有燃燒的危險。</p>
<p>（　　二）甘油化合物封口物甘油是油質。也好用到封口物去。豈不很奇怪嗎？但是化學一件事。是千變萬化的。讀者諸君。請不要性急。俟作者告訴你的原理和製法。用厚甘油加入養化鉛（Okiadeoflrad）（俗名密陀僧）細粉。這兩種一燥一濕的物品。混和了。就可變爲一種極堅牢的塞門德。（Eement）因爲養化鉛是有極大乾燥性的物質。所以甘油雖是不乾燥性的物質。用養化鉛多了。也就要乾結起來。牠的用度。最好是用在石油，汽油，哥羅仿謨，盆純，以脱木精，等的瓶口。因爲牠没有着火的危險。</p>

<h3 id="c197">平民讀物之應改良　　曾裕 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>在敎育如此不普及的中國社會上平民讀物的需要和改良眞是急不容緩，因爲一般没有讀過書的人，他們認識的字當然不多，要適乎他們的讀物，務要意淺字明。現在市上的小説雖然多得汗牛充棟，但是要揀一本適合平民的讀物，可説百難得一。往常看到街頭巷尾乘凉時黄包車夫小三子也能看書，鐵店學徒阿福，賣小菜的王四都能看書，不過你要是去看看他的書名，那不是孟姜女，四時山歌，即是蘇州景，十八摸等，像這一類没有意思的小書幾乎可算</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>他們的唯一讀物，照此情形，所以他們的智識愈弄愈糟。還有比較識字多一點的人，就專喜看「中國數千年來唯一傳家之寳」的神怪而帶的迷信的飛劍奇俠，江湖英雄，仙人，妖怪的鬭法等一類的小説，（現在各書店中還是層出不窮），所以更加害人不淺，腦筋簡單的人，中了他的毒往往痴心夢想想做劍仙，（去年報載無錫某店學徒私逃，留函説到四川峨嵋山去學道），當現在國難緊急之秋，竟有人説「東洋人是不足怕的，我們中國的劍仙俠客就要出世了」，像這類的人他們着了無稽小説之迷，靈智都被泯滅了，這是多可憐呀！然而這種小説的爲害尙不止此，現在不過略舉一二。</p>
<p>關於此問題改良，第一，市上各</p>
<p>書店中，所有各種無稽小説，以後停止再印，未賣完的均須一律封藏。第二撰編小説的人，以後要改變宗旨，小説内容，務要適合時代，或有科學（簡單的）興趣，時勢關係（如國難），或含常識，藝術等，總之再不可編那神怪，迷信，淫穢的無稽小説。第三，每種小説，最好要審查過才可出版。第四，各地須多設平民圖書館（因現各地圖書館内，絶少適合平民的讀物）内中專選採最普通而有意思的平民讀物，并有學者在内隨時指導，使得社會上一般平民暇時都有書看，那麽，他們的智識程度，至少也可因之增高一點。並且，空閒時也不去做各種的無益消遣了。</p>

<h3 id="c198">公園中的女作家吾 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>到底是聰明的女作家，她居然感覺到秋意的濃重，當她獨自一個人來到這公園的時候。　　　　　　　　　這　　是　何的高爽　啊紅葉在擁抱着我，凉風在梳拂着我，啊！這麽美啊！哦這秋天，這飽含詩意的秋天！」</p>
<p>這時候，我們的女作家詩興大發，因爲她確觸着普通的無靈性的人們所不能感觸的東西了。於是我們看見她在她光澤的皮包中掏出那有如自已的生命似的創作草稿簿，以那夾金自來水筆在𫃊𫃊作響的創作。最可惜的是這裏到底是�</p>
<p>空壙的野地，那幽美的走筆的聲音還不夠在那小巧的書房中那般淸脆。然而她心中却充溢了無可抑止的情感，當然這更是我們無靈性的人們所不會感觸的了。</p>
<p>她繼續往下寫，她不停的寫着；　　「……哦！這都市中的幽靜美，這大自然的偉大的賜予。」</p>
<p>多情的男女一對一對的在她面前招展而過，而且每一個靑年男子都對她鍾情的注目；這使她感覺光榮，也使她心頭湧出一刹那的欽羨，於是她放下鋼筆，在皮包中檢出那隨身的袖珍小鏡，照着臉孔重施脂粉。她的頭髮是如此蓬鬆，她的面脥是如此嬌艷，那末她感覺滿足，滿足，何况自己還是個成名的作家。於是她對於那些人工裝就的美麗的少婦不妨輕鄙的訕笑着想：</p>
<p>「你們這些無靈魂的女兒們啊，你們不必以你那妙齡的丈夫向我誇耀罷，假如你的丈夫是一個文藝愛好者，假如你的丈夫知道了我是成名的作家而且拜讀過我的作品的時候，還怕不擯棄你而投向我的懷中來嗎？」</p>
<p>這樣她感覺勝利了。</p>
<p>旣而聽着在她旁邊有男人在切切私語；</p>
<p>「我看她一定是女流小説家，你看她在不停筆的寫着，否則一個平常的女人是不會在公園中寫作的。」</p>
<p>「不是我看不是」，另一人説：「</p>
<p>她一定是在寫情書，她不會是一個了不得的女作家因爲我們知道每一個　　家都是不修邊幅的，他們都歡喜自然美：可是她却是美容院中出來的貨色，她完全是姨太太的裝束，絲毫没有文學家的氣派。」</p>
<p>這樣一來，眞夠使她氣忿了；「難道文學家就没有例外的麽？難道我有錢還不能裝飾麽？」</p>
<p>然而這是靑年男人的批評。男人的眼光是如此，而女文學家應當是如此這般，究竟，自己不能超出藝術家的範圍，那末不便特具典型了。</p>
<p>於是我們的小説家有了新的了解，不妨將在秋意中所獲得的美的靈感也暫時收藏起來，怱忙的跑出公園。</p>
<p>在黃包車上她的心情是如此焦急；她决定立刻回去洗直頭髮，洗去脂粉，可是瘦弱的黃包車夫是跑得這樣緩慢，顯然是有意和她爲難，於是她厲聲大駡道：</p>
<p>「你這個懶傢伙，你没有生脚的嗎？你爲什麽這樣不能跑的。」</p>
<p>這在她自然是詞正言順：她有的錢這個車夫是她僱用的，當然她可駡她，就是打幾下亦無不可。」</p>
<p>她，這樣的作家。如此而已，如此而已。</p>

<h3 id="c199">神妙的照相術　趙樹奎 <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>任何學校機關招考；除掉了證書文憑以外，還要一張四寸的照片，有了照片可以查騐人和照是否，符合杜絶頂替的流弊，這的確是一個很好的辦法。</p>
<p>可是，昨天遇着一個照相裏館的朋友説：現在照相館裏新發明一種混合照相，這是方便學生投考的好東西，譬如，甲要投考某校，自己的程度太差，就不得找一個乙來頂替，可是照片上的面貎不同，只要預先約了乙一同到照相館裏　去照，拍的時候　　　甲，後拍乙，要是甲壯乙瘦吧，乙不妨多穿些衣裳，穿得擁腫來像甲一般，要是甲的眼睛大，乙的眼睛小，那末，甲不妨縮着眼睛，乙不妨瞪大着眼睛，拍出來八分像乙，二分像甲，經過了幾個禮拜，乙已經完全退掉，就變成很淸楚的甲了，這種混合照相，價値很貴要四五塊錢一張呢！哈哈！這樣的照相眞是二十一世紀的新發明呀！</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>

<p>在某租界的某段，是專賣着給喪了臉，彎了腰聳着肩的一般黑籍中人的糧食雅片在這糧食店的前後左右，却包圍着不少白相人和流氓；專事敲詐，恐嚇與扒竊。來採辦糧食的人，受害自然無窮！只不過自己也是私弊犯法的，敲詐了去，只好自認晦氣，正如「啞子吃黃連」説勿出苦，就是好説也不敢説哩。所以這一批流氓和白相人，可以優游其間，樂此不倦，而不啻助長其氣燄，更致横行無忌！相因問的罪惡。遂更3</p>
<p>僕難數！</p>
<p>我有位朋友，他常喜歡開玩笑；有一次，和那種白相人，也尋了一回開心，事情很滑稽的，他告訴我是這樣的：一個晚上，我朋友自稱徘徊在法租界這些糧食店左右，東張西望正在閒晀，不覺間後面發現了緊迫脚步聲，我掉頭一望，看見一個穿藍布短衣的人，我想這一定是拆梢一類的白相人了；他大概以爲我是來買黑飯的，索性將計就計和他開開玩笑。主意打定，我就假裝了一副畏縮形狀，同時提起了二只腿，赶緊的向前跑，他見了跑得快，也就跟得緊；結果他先開口喊我了，</p>
<p>「噲！朋友慢點跑，識相些。」邊</p>
<p>説邊加快了步子，直　到了我身邊。我乘勢很淸楚地和他打了一個照會只見</p>

<p>他那頂鴨舌帽子，歪牢地帶在頭上，二顆眼睛滑溜溜得怕人，好得只有個人，儘不妨玩玩，我就對他説：</p>
<p>「噢！老朋友，自家人馬馬虎虎。」　　「買多少？大家照應照應」。他説着。</p>
<p>「買得不多一些些不過老朋友：不巧得很，身邊的錢，剛巧買完了，只有請你多走幾步，跟我到家裏去拿阿好？」我掉槍花的對他説：</p>
<p>「你家裏在那裏？」他是不耐煩的問。</p>
<p>「一些些路，前面就是。」我又誑他。</p>
<p>於是他只跟我走，我就東灣西拐兜起圏子來，走了一段他總是不耐煩催問着「到了没有？」我總是對他説：「快嘞快嘞」。走走走，這時我已穿過愛多亞路了，照他們白相人規矩，都有地段劃開的，我想他識相些，就可以不必跟了，那裏知道他不肯放休還是釘着，我向前望望快到四馬路了，那巡捕房的紅色牆頭已可瞧見，於是計從心來，忙把頭向後轉對他説：</p>
<p>『這回家裏眞要到了，前面就是。』一邊用指頭點那巡捕房給他看。他一瞧，馬上驚慌了起來。</p>
<p>『赤『連一聲駡都没有駡完，睜睜二隻眼，急忙的向後轉跑了去。那副形狀，不由得我拍手大笑起來。上了一回大當。現在想想，猶覺得趣味無窮呢！</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Value of the League of Nations Investigation Report: Published <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The second mission of the investigation report is to consider possible solutions to the Sino-Japanese dispute. Chapters Nine and Ten elaborate on this mission. The presentation by Sir Lytton and others begins with the principles of resolving the problem, followed by the conditions for a suitable solution, and finally presents their recommendations to the League of Nations Council. This article will criticize it based on this procedure.</p>
<p>The Northeast Incident is a case where Country A used force to occupy the territory of Country B and used force to divide the political sovereignty and integrity of Country B. This is an obvious fact, clearly displayed to the world, self-evident without the need for analysis. However, the report insists on asserting the complexity of the issue with phrases such as "this case is neither an event where this country suddenly declared war on that country without first using the peaceful handling opportunities stipulated in the Covenant of the League of Nations, nor a simple case of one neighboring country invading the border of another neighboring country." Furthermore, it dedicates a section to state that the situation in Manchuria is incomparable to other places. If we take the original report and strip away the diplomatic rhetoric for a naked observation, the special issues advocated by the Japanese are clearly presented on paper. Sir Lytton's profound knowledge of "all the facts and their historical background" completely obscures the issue of China's territorial sovereignty. The fundamental principle being such, it is no wonder that he wastes ink on describing the Japanese explanations, no wonder he considers restoring the old state as not a solution, and no wonder that although he explicitly states the inappropriateness of maintaining the puppet organization, he inevitably has to maintain it in a disguised form, and that he explicitly acknowledges the importance of Manchuria in Japan's economic development. He seeks to approach Sino-Japanese economic relations by preventing anti-Japanese movements from recurring and pays special attention to international interests and Soviet interests. The true meaning of the entire principle is then revealed to us. Sir Lytton and others recognize (1) that Japan needs an economic outlet, and a large and reliable market can only be obtained in Asia, especially in China. (2) The significant interests of the powers in this market must be maintained, and even the interests of the Soviet Union cannot be ignored. (3) As for China, it only needs to be consolidated and modernized, the standard of living raised, trade stimulated, and the purchasing power of the market increased. Based on these three points, recognizing the origin of this principle, if we stand in the position of the Chinese people and evaluate the value of the report with empty words, we know that we will inevitably be laughed at by the world's enlightened people. Furthermore, let us try to observe the so-called appropriate conditions for resolution that come from the aforementioned principles. The ten conditions listed in the report, the first four of which concern the interests of all parties, state in the first item, "suitable for the interests of both China and Japan," and in the fourth item, re-emphasize "recognizing Japan's interests in Manchuria." This is tantamount to indicating that Japan's interests can overshadow China's interests. Items five and six, "establishing new treaty relations between China and Japan" and "effective solutions for the future," will be discussed together when discussing the proposed solutions. The seventh item, "Manchurian autonomy," makes us, after carefully reading the explanatory sentences, have to raise a major question: Is the need for Manchurian autonomy due to its having been invaded, or due to the relationship of the interests of all parties? Can the puppet independence movement manufactured by the Japanese be used as a basis for changing China's administrative organization? Can the intentions of the majority of patriotic soldiers be erased with a single stroke? If this autonomy movement is initiated by the genuine and great residents, we do not want to oppose it. However, autonomy created by international forces, no matter what, cannot be recognized by the people of the whole of China. Because of this, its eighth condition can only be suitable for the withdrawal of the Japanese army. Only when the Japanese army withdraws and the original state of the region is restored can we talk about the issue of order and the issue of security. This is also a fixed and unchangeable procedure. The ninth condition, Sino-Japanese economic coordination, is presented today, lest the timing be too early. Its tenth condition, "promoting China's construction through international cooperation," its final explanation is to promote China's internal construction through temporary international cooperation, while its initial explanation has words such as "The instability of the Chinese government is an obstacle to Sino-Japanese friendship and a concern for other countries. The maintenance of peace in the Far East is an international event, and the above measures cannot be realized until China has a strong central government." This makes the Chinese people, when reading it, cannot help but feel goosebumps, shudder, and dare not thank them.</p>
<p>The recommendations made by the investigation team to the League of Nations Council aim to create (1) a special system for governing the three northeastern provinces through an advisory conference; (2) three treaties of Chinese submission to Japan. The nature and organization of this so-called special system are as described in the report. Anyone who reads the report pays attention to it and has a considerable understanding. The content of the three types of treaties that China should conclude with Japan, and the Japanese interests that should be stipulated in them, are all specifically explained in the recommendations, and there is no need for further elaboration. After reviewing this, what we want to ask is (1) What is the true meaning of this special system? Because the proposed system is tantamount to changing the form of the puppet organization and making it a legitimate existence, and adding some Western advisors to the many Japanese advisors who are manipulating the current Northeast regime. China then declares its recognition of actual management rights in exchange for nominal territorial and administrative integrity and the receipt of some tax revenues. According to our observation, it is by no means a genuine solution to the dispute. (2) Who will hold the actual power in the Northeast in the future? Because training special constables under the current Japanese forces will inevitably result in a disguised form of the current Manchurian army. In the role of genuine special constables, it will be difficult to have foreign instructors, which are nothing more than the Western advisors of the current puppet organization. (3) Is the conclusion of the three types of treaties between China and Japan, as proposed, in line with the meaning of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation? Because China has recognized by treaty and granted Japan extensive rights, and must bear the responsibility of obstructing the anti-Japanese movement, while China's gains are almost equal to zero. To call this economic cooperation is tantamount to cooperation between cats and mice.</p>
<p>Finally, we make a general evaluation of the entire report of the investigation team. It can be asserted that it attempts to replace China's recovery of lost territory in the three northeastern provinces with complex international relations, coupled with the existing facts created by the Japanese. The so-called review of the dispute between the two countries and the reconciliation of the fundamental interests of the two countries are nothing more than diplomatic rhetoric that obscures the true face of Mount Lu.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Luo Wengan Issues Declaration After Publication of Lytton Report <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Two Points Clearly Presented in the Report</p>
<p>Many Important Issues Are Currently Under Consideration</p>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd: Luo Wengan issued a declaration regarding the League of Nations Investigation Report, stating that the League of Nations Investigation Report has been published. This is the result of months of tireless and arduous work by Sir Lytton and his colleagues for international peace. We still remember that on December 10th of last year, the reason why the League of Nations decided to dispatch an investigation team was to find a final and fundamental solution to the situation caused by Japan's invasion of Chinese territory. Mr. Briand, when submitting the resolution to dispatch an investigation team to the League of Nations Council for its consideration and adoption on that day, said, "The scope of the investigation team's duties is extremely broad in principle. Any issue that affects international relations and that the investigation team deems necessary to study because it may disturb the peace between China and Japan or the understanding between the two countries on which peace depends shall not be excluded." Therefore, in terms of the duties of the investigation team, the investigation team's claim to review all relevant facts and suggest peaceful solutions to the League of Nations is a completely correct interpretation. After briefly browsing the report, it is felt that there are two most clearly presented points: one is that all Japanese military actions on and after September 18th have no legitimate reason and cannot be considered as a means of self-defense; the other is that the so-called Manchuguo is not produced by a genuine and natural independence movement, but is the result of manipulation by the Japanese army and Japanese civil and military officials. The report contains many issues of extremely important nature, which are currently being carefully considered by the Chinese government authorities. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Nanjing: After the publication of the League of Nations Investigation Report, before the discussion by the Central Political Council, they are unwilling to express opinions to the outside world. The ministers proposed a discussion at the Administrative Yuan meeting on the 4th, but on the evening of the 3rd, they exchanged opinions at Song's residence in Beijige in order to obtain a concrete concept for reference to the Central Political Council tomorrow.

<p>Nanjing: After the publication of the League of Nations Investigation Report, it was decided to submit it to the Central Political Council meeting on the 5th and the Administrative Yuan meeting on the 4th for careful discussion in order to make a statement in the future.

<h3 id="e5">Hu Shi Comments on the League of Nations Report <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Peiping: Tonight, a Reuters reporter visited Hu Shi to inquire about his opinion on the Lytton Report. Hu said that the report is fair, especially the ten principles in Chapters Four and Six for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute, which he also agreed with. However, he opposed the recommendation of the advisory conference, believing that this was an error that favored the situation created by the Japanese. The reporter asked if the Chinese are now opposed to the establishment of a special administrative region in the three northeastern provinces, what does he think? Hu replied that he did not think this plan should be strictly rejected. Hu also said that this proposal was made by Sir Lytton (British Commissioner), General McCoy (American Commissioner), and Dr. Schnee (German Commissioner), who felt that China's future political development would proceed along the lines of federal autonomy, and he also thought so.

<h3 id="e6">Southwest Asks Not to Rely on the League of Nations <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong: The Southwest Executive Department held a meeting yesterday and still telegraphed the central government not to rely too much on the League of Nations and to strive for self-reliance. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[P Liu Shigu Firmly Defends Yexian and Laiyang]</p>
<p>Han Fuqu Complies with Orders to Cease Attack</p>
<p>Han's Cavalry Arrived in Yantai</p>
<p>Nanjing: Regarding the Han-Liu conflict, according to the Third Route Army's office in Nanjing, Liu's division is firmly defending Yexian and Laiyang. Liu himself is commanding in Yexian. The east, south, and west sides of the city are surrounded by Han's troops, leaving only the north gate for the people to escape. The defensive fortifications built in Yexian are extremely solid, and there is a lot of grain stored in the city, planning for a long defense. According to the 21st Division's communications office in Nanjing, Liu's troops are firmly defending Yexian and Laiyang, and Han's troops have repeatedly attacked and been repelled. Liu is determined to comply with Chairman Chiang's instructions and await the results of the investigation for a fair resolution. According to military sources, the commissioners sent by the Ministry of Military Affairs to inspect the front line have telegraphed the situation of the two armies in stalemate. The military authorities are still deliberating on the final disposal method. It is faintly heard that the central government believes that Han's use of troops without prior reporting is too contemptuous of the central government's authority. If Liu cannot be reconciled in Shandong, he can be transferred to another defense area. Liu's military pay has now been secured and will not cause further entanglement with Shandong Province. According to the latest news from the military, Han has indeed complied with orders to cease the attack and seems to be preparing to withdraw troops. The capital has telegraphed this situation urgently to Lushan. After Chiang Kai-shek replies and confirms, the central government will not need to consider a second step. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Jinan: Zhang Chengxi, the director of the Yexian Telegraph Bureau, transmitted a commercial telegram with awkward phrasing, and it was rumored that Liu intended to execute him by firing squad. The Shandong telegraph industry was in an uproar and will telegraph the whole country after verification and ask the central government to order Han to attack Liu. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Jinan: Today, Chen Weixin replaced Han to comfort the troops in Jiaodong. It is heard that Cheng Lie and Zheng Zhexun went to Mount Tai to visit Feng. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Yantai: Han's cavalry arrived in Yantai yesterday but did not enter the town. They have now moved to Fushan, about ten miles west of here. Han's infantry has not yet arrived in the vicinity. According to Li Shuangde (transliteration), the commander of the cavalry, the commander of the Chinese Marine Corps who landed to maintain law and order said that his cavalry is now planning to engage in rural pacification, so Yantai is temporarily entrusted to the Marine Corps for defense. Li also said that some of Han's troops have passed Laiyang and are advancing towards Qixia. Foreign authorities apparently believe that the overall situation has improved. All but one of the American warships anchored here have left. One British warship and several Chinese warships have come here to prevent unrest and are anchored in the port. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Yu Xuezhong told reporters on the 3rd: (1) I am a Shandong native and it is inconvenient to talk about the Han-Liu conflict. Initially, I hoped that no war would occur. Now, I only hope that it will end quickly, otherwise it will give the League of Nations a bad impression. As far as I know, Liu built defensive works around the mountains of Yexian, Laiyang, and Qixia two years ago, and grain and ammunition were fully prepared long ago. If the central government does not urgently seek a solution, it may take half a year to complete. (2) The most important thing is county administration. If county administration can be done well, provincial administration will naturally be good. If provincial administration is good, national politics will naturally be on the right track. I am determined to seriously rectify county administration. After taking office, I only gave each county a whip. In the future, I will have to strictly implement reward and punishment measures to promote progress. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Liu Zhendian, the representative of Zhang Guangshen, said that Liu is still in Yexian. Although most of Han's troops have not advanced, they still send small units to challenge every day, and conflicts occur from time to time. According to a telegram from He Yisan, Han's troops have repeatedly attacked Yexian without success. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Peiping: Ma Zhanshan contacted various units for a counterattack and personally went to Datun to supervise the army. A fierce battle is imminent on the Qiqihar line within days. Zhang Wengui, the commander of the puppet police, is in charge of the security of the provincial capital of Heilongjiang. The market is extremely depressed. There are only 500 Japanese troops in the city, and fortresses have been built on the city walls. The Hiraga Brigade of the Japanese army stationed near the Angangxi station has opened Shenyang. The defenses there are empty. The righteous army led by Li Haiqing once attacked the Angangxi station. Because there was no supply, they withdrew that night. The route from Bu Kui to Harbin is still peaceful. Righteous armies are found day and night on the route from Harbin to Shenyang via the Fengshan Road, and traffic is occasionally obstructed. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Harbin: Since Su Bingwen's troops revolted in Manchuria on the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, they have gradually taken an offensive stance. Anda Station and various stations on the western section were captured by righteous armies last night. The Chinese Eastern Railway has declared a temporary suspension of traffic. Li Haiqing's troops have also approached the outskirts of Angangxi. Therefore, the Japanese army and rebel army in Heihe have mostly been transferred to fight on the three fronts of Anda, Angangxi, and Manchuria. The entire city of Heihe is empty, and the people are shaken. Su Bingwen has also rejected the requests of the puppet organization and the Japanese. The righteous army is determined to attack Heihe from three directions. Heihe is currently in imminent danger. (China United News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Peiping: Dong Rongji, the commander-in-chief of the National Salvation Army, led more than 9,000 troops to besiege Goubangzi. They have been engaged in close combat with more than 5,000 Japanese, Korean, and puppet troops since the 30th. The enemy has repeatedly used airplanes and artillery to bombard. At 10:00 am on the 2nd, the merchants and civilians in Goubangzi reacted to the National Salvation Army. The 30th Route Army of Mu Hua, with 3,000 troops from the south, came to help. The enemy retreated eastward. Our army occupied Goubangzi. The merchants and civilians all hung the national flag to welcome and celebrate. After a brief rest, Dong's troops continued to advance.

<p>Peiping: Meng Zhaoyan, the commander of the National Salvation Army, personally supervised his troops to fiercely attack Yixian City starting on the 23rd of last month, and divided his troops to attack Chaoyang Temple Station. After six or seven days of bloody battles, he killed many enemies and captured many military supplies. The traffic between Chao and Yi is now cut off. The Japanese are quite alarmed. Japanese public and private goods in Yixian are now being transported to other places overnight. Jinzhou has sent a team of reinforcements to jointly defend. Our side is trying to destroy the defensive fortifications around the city walls and is determined to capture it in the short term. The enemy troops in Chaoyang Temple are in an isolated situation. Recently, enemy aircraft have come to our positions to scout and bombard, causing dozens of casualties. Sun and Song's troops have joined other units to attack the areas of Dahushan, Goubangzi, and Beizhen with all their strength. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Peiping: Li Keyi's troops of the Northeast Student Army joined more than 10,000 righteous troops on the Hasui line to besiege the Japanese army in Weisha River, Jilin. On the 23rd, the Japanese army dispatched a train from Harbin to aid. When it passed Wujimi Station, it was destroyed by a landmine buried by the righteous army.

<p>Harbin: It is widely rumored here by both Russian and Japanese sources that the war in northern Manchuria is becoming more intense, which shows the abnormality and disorder of the situation in various parts of northern Manchuria. According to Russian reports, the entire route of the Chinese Eastern Railway, from Qiqihar to Manchuria, a total length of more than 260 miles, is in turmoil. Anda Station, 60 miles from Harbin, has also been captured by the anti-Manchu army, so traffic to and from Qiqihar is cut off. Trains from Harbin to the Siberian border have been temporarily suspended. According to Japanese sources, 5,000 anti-Manchu troops, commanded by Li Haiqing, recently attacked the Taonan Railway. The Japanese claim that the anti-Manchu army suffered more than 300 casualties on this road and has been defeated, but Li Haiqing has regrouped and plans to attack again. The Japanese army is counterattacking and has surrounded a part of Li's army north of Qiqihar. The war north of Qiqihar is still in progress, but the anti-Manchu army lacks aircraft and has no anti-aircraft guns, so Japanese aircraft can freely roam in the enemy's camp and open machine guns to inflict damage on the volunteer army. Russian troops on the border have increased their numbers, and it is said that their purpose is to prevent troops from crossing into Russian territory and to disarm them. According to Russian press opinion, can the Northwest Railway Protection Army, which has now revolted and killed many Japanese, have received Soviet Russian aid? Russian newspapers here also claim that a member of the Russian Communist Party is now serving as a translator and investigator for the anti-Manchu army in Hailar, and a part of the army is under his command. Therefore, this person is using his power to arrest and kill White Russians and Japanese. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>

<p>Stimson will Express his Opinion After Reviewing the Contents</p>
<p>Official Circles Believe it is Not Contrary to the Hoover Doctrine</p>
<p>Washington, November 2 (National News Agency) - The United States' official opinion on the Lytton Report's investigation must await Secretary of State Stimson's detailed study of the report. Mr. Stimson is expected to return to Washington from his vacation in New York today and immediately begin his review. According to unofficial comments from those close to the government, the report contains a broad and exceptional objective study of the Manchurian situation and is expected to contribute to a solution that satisfies both China and Japan. US officials who have studied the report in detail are pleased to see that it firmly upholds the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact on the Manchurian issue. They say that the suggestion to preserve China's territorial and administrative integrity is in line with US views, and the recognition of Japan's important and special interests in Manchuria is indispensable to any final solution.</p>
<p>Washington, November 2 (National News Agency) - Today, US Secretary of State Stimson first consulted with Peck, the Director of the Far Eastern Division of the State Department, about the Lytton Report. Then, the two of them and other key officials of the State Department studied the contents of the report in detail. Mr. Stimson is unwilling to express his opinion until he has completed his study, but it is reported that senior US government officials believe that this report provides a broad and satisfactory working basis for resolving the Manchurian issue. The inclusion of Russia's interests in the report is even more regarded as farsighted, demonstrating the investigation team's desire to achieve lasting peace in Manchuria. Some who are familiar with international affairs believe that the report is equally fair to both China and Japan and proves that the investigation team has a strong desire to ensure that Manchuria remains Chinese in form and in the nationality of its people, while providing adequate protection for Japanese interests. In short, no one in Washington believes that this report is contrary to US policy.</p>
<p>Washington, November 2 (National News Agency) - US officials have expressed satisfaction with the Lytton Report, but those who generally focus on practical matters feel that there are many difficulties in implementing its recommendations, as Japan will inevitably oppose many items in the recommendations, especially the proposal not to station troops. Well-informed sources here deeply doubt whether Japan will agree to withdraw all its stationed troops. Regarding the abolition of the puppet state and its replacement with a new government nominally subordinate to Nanjing, it is also expected that Japan may not be able to agree. The opinion here is that the only hope for Japan to agree to the Lytton recommendations lies in its feeling that it is difficult to deal with the Manchurian volunteer army, as it costs a lot to suppress this volunteer army, and the economic benefits during this period of war are minimal and insufficient to offset this long-term huge expenditure.</p>
<p>New York, November 3 (Reuters) - New York newspapers’ Washington correspondents all believe that although the US State Department has not yet criticized the Lytton Report, it is clearly planning to use the power of the US government to support the proposals made by Lytton and others regarding a peaceful resolution of the Manchurian case. Washington officials view the report as being just in its overall assessment and as providing a practical way to resolve the difficulties. According to reliable sources, the responsible parties believe that the US government does not want to take any action on this matter at this time, believing that since it is currently being investigated by an organization representing a majority of countries, the only appropriate course for the United States is to wait quietly for the action of the League of Nations. The New York Times today published an editorial commenting on the report as containing rich and penetrating insights and being fair in its arguments. It also said that the report demonstrates a desire for China and Japan to engage in reconciliation and for the great powers to cooperate with each other to help China escape the scourge of civil war and build a stable government.</p>
<p>New York, November 2 (Reuters) - The New York Tribune claims that Japan made a big mistake by immediately recognizing "Manchukuo" before the Lytton Report was released. Autonomy in the three eastern provinces without stationing troops, with the consent of China and the goodwill of the international community, would be of greater value from a strategic point of view than permanently occupying it by force, inviting local resistance, Chinese animosity, and international suspicion.</p>

<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (Japan Allied News) - After the Lytton Report was released, newspapers such as Asahi, Hochi, and Nichi-Nichi severely criticized it this morning, calling it a report of misconception, distortion, insufficient understanding, disrespect, and foolishness. What it said was an exaggerated and delusional dream. They also revealed articles stating that Japan should withdraw from the League of Nations. The House of Peers and various political parties also expressed opinions criticizing the investigation team's lack of understanding.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (Reuters) - Today, all newspapers are paying attention to the Lytton Report and have no time to care about other matters, and all unanimously express dissatisfaction, but the general tone is still mild.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (Den Tsushin) - Regarding the Lytton Report, which is viewed as an attempt to judge the Far Eastern issue, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an editorial today stating that those who dominated the minds of the members of the investigation team consistently based their arguments on the withdrawal of troops, regardless of the circumstances, which is nothing more than the theory of the League of Nations and has fallen into the error of what they call "disregarding the realizer." As for the principles and conditions for a solution, the advocacy of international cooperation is even more empty talk that disregards history. What authority is there to ask for such a solution?</p>

<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (China United Press) - Since the release of the Lytton Report, the Japanese government and public have been greatly angered. In addition to Foreign Minister Uchida and Army Minister Araki issuing statements last night, the Japanese government has not yet expressed its attitude. It is reported that a cabinet meeting will be convened tomorrow to discuss the measures, and then a statement will be issued in the name of the Tokyo government. The main points of Japan's dissatisfaction are roughly as follows: (1) The Lytton Report does not recognize the Japanese military's actions as self-defense; (2) It does not recognize that the independence of the puppet organization is due to the free will of the people of the Northeast; (3) It recognizes that sovereignty still belongs to China and does not recognize the various facts created by Japanese military power; (4) It opposes various solutions proposed by the investigation team.</p>

<p>Plans to Draft an Opinion Paper to Refute it</p>
<p>Willing to Sever Ties with the League of Nations</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (Reuters) - A Foreign Ministry spokesman said this morning that the Japanese government plans to only briefly touch upon the last few chapters of the Lytton Report, as "Manchukuo" has already been recognized and there is no need to comment on it in detail. Japan's opinion paper can be drafted in about two or three weeks.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (Den Tsushin) - The report of the investigation team, which is viewed as an attempt to judge the Far Eastern issue, was officially released at 9:00 PM yesterday. The Japanese government authorities decided that the contents of the report were too inappropriate and had deviated from the original mission of the investigation team, so they decided to submit an opinion paper to the League of Nations Council on November 4 to refute it in detail. The authorities have established a joint committee of the Foreign Ministry and the Army to start drafting. It is reported that the Japanese government's policy on the opinion paper is roughly as follows: (1) The mission of the investigation team, as resolved by the League of Nations Council on December 10 last year, does not have legal binding force on the League of Nations General Assembly and only provides reference materials. It is hoped that the League of Nations will not be bound by the report and will adapt to the new situation on the ground to seek appropriate solutions. (2) Chapters 1, 2, 3, 7, and 8 of the report mainly describe facts, and there are generally no objections, but Chapter 4 describes the Manchurian situation after September 18, Chapter 5 describes the Shanghai Incident, and Chapter 6 states that "Manchukuo" cannot be recognized by the Japanese government. (3) Chapter 9 on the arguments and conditions for a solution and Chapter 10 on the conclusion are not considered by the Japanese government, which has recognized "Manchukuo" as an independent country. In particular, the proposal to establish a demilitarized zone with the organization of a gendarmerie under the cooperation of international instructors as a condition for not recognizing the autonomous occurrence and growth of Manchukuo is a proposal that completely exceeds the mission of the investigation team, and the Japanese government absolutely cannot recognize it. (4) Although the Japanese government has no intention of automatically inducing the worst-case scenario to seek to withdraw from the alliance, if the alliance continues its lack of understanding, it has the intention of severing ties with the alliance and moving towards an independent solution to the Far Eastern issue. This must be stated.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (Reuters) - The general opinion in Japan is that the suggestions for resolving the Manchurian case in the Lytton Report, if proposed half a year ago, would have been acceptable to Japan, but today the independence of the new country has already been completed, and it is impossible to accept it. Furthermore, officials here believe that the best policy for the League of Nations is to wait two or three years for "Manchukuo" to have the opportunity to prove its ability and security. After this period expires, the League of Nations can decide which is better, autonomy under China or outright independence, especially since the Chinese government itself is also unstable.</p>

<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (Den Tsushin) - The Seiyukai issued the following statement by President Suzuki today regarding the Lytton Report: The Lytton Report's proposed solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute is nothing more than a castle in the air, because it does not conform to the reality of the Far East, so it is impossible to implement. Even if it could be implemented, the situation would be worse than what led to the September 18th Incident. It is sufficient for the three countries of China, Japan, and Russia to resolve the issue, and if the League of Nations is involved, things will become more complicated and confusing. However, the life and death relationship of the realistic Japan and the national sentiment cannot be ignored by any country in the world.</p>
<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (Den Tsushin) - The Minseito issued the following statement regarding the report: The Lytton Report expresses a surprising lack of understanding. The fact that the central government of China has no real power to govern Manchuria is a clear fact, so Manchuria is a breeding ground for bandits and red movements, and the Lytton Committee wants to return those who have no ability to govern to the status of sovereign, which will only make Manchuria a lane of turmoil again, both domestically and internationally.</p>

<p>▲ Tokyo, November 3 (China United Press) - After the Japanese government received the Lytton Report, it was very embarrassed. It is reported that the Japanese Navy Department has decided to replenish its naval strength and has decided to use a new budget of 500 million Japanese yen to build new warships and various new weapons in preparation for actively resisting the US. The Japanese Ministry of Finance, due to the firm attitude of the Navy Department, has agreed to negotiate separately to meet its demands.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Observations from Geneva <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Saying it can consider both law and facts</p>
<p>▲Havas Agency, Geneva, 2nd. A special correspondent for Le Temps of Paris claims that those in charge at the League of Nations believe the Lytton Report is able to consider both law and facts. For example, the report explains that the "Manchukuo" is not an organization automatically created by residents, and advocates for maintaining Chinese sovereignty in Manchuria, all of which are points based on legal arguments. As for the facts, the report fully acknowledges that Japan's rights in Manchuria have indeed been damaged. The report also repeatedly explains and proposes a solution that advocates for close cooperation between China and Japan within a certain territorial range. Within this territory, China would have its sovereignty, its administration would be autonomous, and Japan's special rights within this territory would also need to be fully recognized. As for the rights of various foreign countries within Manchuria, the investigation team concluded that the Open Door Policy should be maintained. All of these are based on factual considerations.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Geneva, 3rd. People at the League of Nations have mixed feelings about the Lytton Report, with some offering commentary. They believe that the investigation team's recommendations are tantamount to abandoning the League of Nations' obligations and promises. Regarding Article 10 of the Covenant, which guarantees the complete territorial integrity of each member state, this situation is particularly obvious. They fear that some small countries, wanting to avoid creating the most dangerous precedent for themselves, will vigorously oppose the proposed solution. However, some believe that we cannot prejudge that Japan will definitely violate the principles of the League of Nations. Therefore, even if Japan, according to the investigation team's plan, can obtain a very large sphere of influence in Manchuria, it is not fundamentally strange that it still does not agree to internationalize Manchuria in this way. In short, observers here all believe that future discussions on the Lytton Report at the League of Nations are likely to provoke extremely complex and difficult negotiations between Japan and the major powers.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 2nd. It is generally expected that the scope of the conference on the clear questions presented in the Lytton Report has been clearly defined. Therefore, the point that China previously opposed direct negotiations with Japan should be eliminated. As for the various proposals contained in the report, it is generally believed that Japan may not necessarily agree to withdraw all armed forces except for the constabulary. It is also believed that Japan may not necessarily agree to completely change the current situation in the three northeastern provinces and implement a new system of autonomy within the framework of Chinese sovereignty and administrative integrity. The general opinion is that this report is the most noteworthy document published by a group under the auspices of the League of Nations. Its narration and arguments are prudent and moderate, and the writing style is elegant, clearly showing an English style. From its wording, it seems that every part was written by Lytton himself, but it is obvious that some parts were inserted later. This report can be regarded as an indictment of the Japanese.</p>
<p>▲International Telegraph Agency, Geneva, 2nd. Yesterday, Sunday, hundreds of reporters from various countries gathered in the League of Nations press room, quietly waiting for the publication of the Lytton Report. Everyone recognizes that this report is of extremely great importance. The report contains thousands of words that criticize Japanese militarism and judge that the Japanese military's seizure of Shenyang on the night of September 18th, using the excuse of self-defense, was improper. The section in the report that demands the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Manchuria can obtain strong support from various small countries because they fear that Japan's actions will be imitated, endangering their own future independence and security. Furthermore, French Premier Herriot's attitude has formed a consensus in Geneva. According to Herriot, France does not take sides between China and Japan, but Europe must maintain the League of Nations Covenant and various treaties in the Far East. This not only concerns the interests of the League of Nations but also has a great impact on world peace.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Geneva, 3rd. Now that all sectors have the opportunity to leisurely study the Lytton Report, it is now possible to express opinions more completely and from a broader perspective. Although the first impression seems to indicate that the report is entirely unfavorable to Japan and protects the Chinese side, there are currently many divergent opinions, which must be acknowledged. For example, various sectors in Poland said that the resolutions in the report are slightly far-fetched or too circuitous based on their premises. They believe that the evidence collected by the investigation team is indeed very helpful to the Japanese side, but its resolutions are unfavorable to Japan. The report has shown that China is not currently in a position to restore order or reorganize to return to normalcy. They also said that the investigation team even admitted that it is impossible to restore the old situation in the three northeastern provinces, and some even said that recognizing Japan's special economic and financial interests proves the legitimacy of its special actions. Other European opinions believe that the report may be the basis for a coordinated solution, especially the conditions for granting autonomy to the new government of Manchuria. However, the majority opinion regards the report as a solemn and practical plan formulated based on a prudent, complete, and objective investigation, indicating that although Japan has legitimate hopes in terms of economy and security, there is really no way to find a solution except based on Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Various Opinions of British Newspapers <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd. The Manchester Guardian stated that the Lytton Report was painstakingly drafted with gentle and reasonable wording. If it makes Japanese behavior more understandable, it also makes it more detestable. The world must not allow Japan to achieve its main purpose of destroying the credibility of the League of Nations by recognizing "Manchukuo." The newspaper agrees with the investigation team's view that Japan's current success in the three northeastern provinces is not a blessing for Japan itself because it has created resentment, especially China's eternal hatred of Japan, which is extremely unfavorable to Japan's future. The newspaper also said that if China's demands for its treaty rights, such as the credibility of the League of Nations Covenant and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, fall in the Far East, they will be despised everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 3rd. Today, all London newspapers have criticisms regarding the Lytton Report. The Times editorial stated that the principles of the Lytton Report are not difficult to acknowledge, but the time elapsed between the drafting of the report and its delivery to Geneva has unfortunately made the report's conclusions seem to have been damaged by this time gap. Furthermore, the investigation team's departure was slightly delayed, and its return was before Japan recognized "Manchukuo," which was also a disadvantage for the investigation team. The investigation team's task was originally to investigate the facts of Shenyang, but the investigation team did not arrive in the Far East until five months after the incident. What the League of Nations and the United States are now encountering is a variation of the three northeastern provinces becoming a Japanese protectorate. The report suggests a solution that, in the investigation team's view, can be applied to the situation in the three northeastern provinces that they saw, and gives full understanding to Japan's special political and economic interests. Therefore, the proposals it drafted are not suitable for the legitimate form of an arbitrator but are suitable for the wisdom of friends of both China and Japan. Considering today's environment, can this kind of proposal be immediately realized in practice? This is the question. There is absolutely no doubt that Tokyo will not be willing to accept these proposals, but the Lytton team is sure that the public opinion in the three northeastern provinces is against Japan. Japan is now in great difficulty, its financial resources are unable to maintain the cost of continuing military operations, and its people may eventually express sympathy for the Lytton Report and believe that ignoring the public opinion in the three northeastern provinces can never be a blessing for Japan. Foreign governments will certainly need some time to study the significance of this report. It is not appropriate to make hasty decisions, and there must be collective rather than individual diplomatic actions. The League of Nations Administrative Council may not be able to discuss this report before next month. At that time, it will encounter the difficult problem of maintaining the principles of the League of Nations Covenant on the one hand and considering unprecedented facts on the other. It is thought that the appropriate time for the League of Nations to actively consider may not be seen soon. The Daily Telegraph stated that the Lytton Report expresses sincere and thorough plans in the hope of determining the right and wrong of both sides. The report does not support the League of Nations' propaganda that accuses the Japanese side of infringing on the rights of weaker countries. Although it advocates that the secession of the three northeastern provinces from China is invalid, it recognizes Japanese interests in the eastern provinces. The proposals in the report seek to solve this problem while maintaining the dignity of both China and Japan. Unfortunately, international success is unlikely because Japan believes that the Manchurian problem has already been solved. The conclusion of the report is that China must have a strong central government. This level is still a major obstacle to the solution. If the solution must wait for China's internal construction and the result of international cooperation, there will be a long wait. Although Japan's actions in the three northeastern provinces are inappropriate, Chinese politics also contributed to them. The Morning Post paid attention to the point in the report about building a strong government in China and stated that China's future is feared to disintegrate. Currently, there is "Manchukuo" in the north, a variation of independence in Guangdong in the south, and a Soviet republic in Mongolia. The authority of the Nanjing government cannot reach far. Therefore, saying that the Republic of China is the ruler of China is just a "courtesy title." If Japan and other countries can cooperate to rebuild a strong central government in China, it can be said to be a great success. But whether this plan can be realized is questionable. The Daily Mail stated that the Lytton Report recognizes that Japan is guilty. The investigation team has made this judgment, and Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon may not be able to continue to tolerate Japan's actions. The hope that the League of Nations will resolve the Sino-Japanese incident is very slim. If Japan refuses the League of Nations' solution, the League of Nations will inevitably take further action (the newspaper did not specify what this further action would be). Otherwise, we will again engage in the dominance of the omnipotence of force. Fortunately, this time the League of Nations has obtained the cooperation of the United States. In taking any action to maintain the law, we can obtain the full assistance of the United States. The Daily Mail stated that the Lytton Report will have no results. Although the report is not as anti-Japanese as previously rumored, it does have a bias towards China. However, the report does not pay attention to the most important fact, that if it were not for Japan's sacrificial war against Russia in 1904, the three northeastern provinces would have long become Russian territory. As for the construction proposals of the investigation team, they must actually be realized through several years of meetings. It seems difficult to establish them in the current environment. The newspaper advocates that Foreign Secretary Simon should not support any actions that would promote Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations because Japan's withdrawal would cause various disputes, and Japan's presence in the three northeastern provinces is actually the same in nature as Britain's presence in India and Egypt. The Westminster Gazette calls on Prime Minister MacDonald to reassert his influence in diplomacy. Until now, all countries have been extremely weak in dealing with the Manchurian problem, and the policy that Britain should adopt, which is to unite with the United States for joint action and to be joined by other countries and to be observed by Japan, has not yet been implemented. This time Lytton's report is a test of the League of Nations' capabilities. Today, if we want to seek the security of European countries, all countries should adopt the same front, and the most important thing is the consistency of the attitudes of Britain and the United States. If the MacDonald government only adopts a wait-and-see attitude and does not take immediate action, the credibility of the current government will be greatly affected.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 2nd. French criticisms of the Lytton Report are mostly worded cautiously and with a cold attitude. Le Figaro stated that this report may not be able to solve the problems in the three northeastern provinces, and the compromise it proposes may not be able to enhance the reputation of the League of Nations. Le Débat stated that the writer of this report made a mistake, needing to change the status quo but also acknowledging the inevitability of "Manchukuo." If the independence of the new state is already a problem, then the authorities of "Manchukuo" may not agree to participate in the meeting proposed by the investigation team.</p>
<p>▲Havas Agency, Paris, 2nd. Le Matin published an article commenting on the Lytton Report, stating: "There is a key point in the report that can immediately attract attention. What is the key point? The investigation team recommends in its conclusions that the organization of the Manchurian government should be changed, and a broad autonomous administrative system should be established, striving to be suitable for local conditions and the special circumstances of the three northeastern provinces, and not contradict Chinese sovereignty and its administrative integrity. But Japan has already recognized Manchukuo half a month ago. Now, is it not difficult to make it step back?" etc.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Paris, 2nd. Saint-Brice, a reporter for Le Journal, wrote an article on the Lytton Report, stating: "The Lytton Report can now allow the League of Nations to prepare for work without causing further interference and without causing self-immolation and allowing the United States to reap the benefits. We get a clear lesson from the end of the report, that the affairs of the Chinese and Japanese should be left to their own resolution because both sides should properly compromise their disputes themselves. International participation will only increase their intensity." Saint-Brice also said that the Lytton Report strives to be fair between China and Japan, but its conclusion states: "The report inevitably has contradictions. On the one hand, it says that China should be completely autonomous, and on the other hand, it believes that it should be under guardianship. This is one. On the one hand, it says that China and Japan can never be compatible, and on the other hand, it believes that the two countries should compromise with each other. This is two. In short, there is obvious proof in the report, that restoring the old situation is impossible." etc.</p>

<p>▲China United Press, Tokyo, 3rd. The armed immigrants of Japan have always been handled by demobilized soldiers and civilian immigration associations. This time, because the Colonial Ministry received an immigration fee of 950,000 yen, it ordered the East Manchurian Immigration Association run by Lieutenant General Inoue and the Tomobe National Higher School to select 442 people from demobilized soldiers in Yamagata, Akita, Aomori, Iwate, Ibaraki, Tochigi, Fukushima, Nanae, Niigata, and Nagano prefectures and provide them with training in various military, agricultural, and immigration knowledge. They were led by Lieutenant Colonel Imaichi, Captain Kumagai, Captain Kutsusawa, Lieutenant Kudo, Lieutenant Tokunaga, and Military Doctor Horiguchi. This morning, they departed from Tokyo Station on the Baikal Maru, which left Kobe on the 5th, via Dalian to develop land and build military roads along the Songhua River in Jilin Province. Because this is the first armed immigration founded by militarists, they received send-offs and encouragement from Japanese military and political dignitaries at the time of departure, urging them not to repeat the failures of previous immigrations and disappoint the nation.</p>

Since the Tanaka Cabinet arrested Japanese communists en masse in 1928, prisons throughout the country have been filled with political prisoners, making it difficult to meet current needs. Especially since the September 18th Incident, with the rise of Japanese fascists, a widespread anti-war, anti-imperialist, and anti-fascist movement has been constantly breaking out throughout Japan. It is heard that the Ministry of Justice, fearing that all prisons in the country will be full, has specially requested the construction of new prisons to meet the current urgent needs.</p>

Fortunately, with the unity and cooperation of the military and civilians, we have worked hard to gradually eliminate them. However, in the recovered areas, everything has been exhausted, there is no house that has not been burned, no tree that has not been felled, no chicken or dog left, and no plowing cattle that have not been killed. According to reports from front-line generals in the past half month, places such as Shangcheng, Guangshan, and Gushi in Henan; Liu'an, Jinzhai, Yingshan, and Huoshan in Anhui; and Huang'an, Macheng, Luotian, Mianyang, and Jianli in Hubei are all like wasteland. The land is desolate, no smoke is seen, only wild cries are heard, and even thousands upon thousands of people kneel before the army, with emaciated faces, lying stiffly on the roadside. After reading these reports, Zhongzheng was angry and saddened. He has telegraphed the governments of the three provinces to rush to provide disaster relief and food relief, and to send personnel to provide assistance. He has also promulgated measures to reduce and exempt land taxes in bandit suppression areas for compliance to provide stability. However, the recovered areas have been sinking for a long time, the disasters are deep, there are many people waiting to be relieved, the areas waiting to be relieved are even wider, the food for relief is limited, and the funds for relief are extremely small. Soon autumn will end and winter will come, and it is unbearable to imagine the deaths from freezing and starvation. Zhongzheng deeply believes that when hunger and cold reach the body, even a loving mother cannot protect her child, and from ancient times, famine has been followed by great chaos. After the great chaos is quelled, it must be followed by famine, which are mutually causal. If we do not properly plan for the aftermath, the stability of the local area and the restoration of order will never be possible. Therefore, I hope that all people's organizations, charitable institutions, and wealthy households will do their best to collect large sums of money for relief, and report the amount collected to this headquarters for verification and dispatch. It must be known that in these days of multiple disasters, if we want to save ourselves, we must first save others. If the country is not peaceful, where can the home be safe? We must also know that saving people is not entirely from the idea of ​​alleviating suffering, but is actually a normal duty. We will make the people who violate the law have hope of rebirth, equalize happiness and suffering, and make society have a chance to recover. Fortune, misfortune, safety, and danger are indeed shared with the people of the whole country. Furthermore, there is another thing to be said. Since the military campaign began, not only has the chaos been more severe than in the past, but the honesty has also been inferior to the past. Cities are becoming more and more extravagant, while rural areas are suffering more and more. If this continues to develop day by day, even without foreign troubles, how can we avoid destruction? I hope that all school and organization leaders and women's organizations will form inspection teams to visit the disaster areas in batches to understand the truth and plan for relief. This headquarters will pay attention to protecting and facilitating their inspection process so that the whole country, from top to bottom, will be aware of this tragedy, commonly advocate simplicity, strive to curb extravagance, restore the countryside, and promote the sales of agricultural products as a common goal and path for our people. I hope that you will carefully consider this. Chiang Kai-shek, 30th year of the Republic of China, printed</p>

<h3 id="e63">Chiang Bo-cheng Leaves Jinan and Returns to Beiping <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since Chiang Bo-cheng was ordered to go to Shandong to meet with Han Fuju regarding the Jiaodong issue, Han immediately ordered his troops at the front to cease military action and telegraphed all parties to report. Chiang and Han also returned to Jinan one after another to wait for the central government to resolve the matter. Since then, there has only been local contact in the Yexian area, and there has been no major battle. Subsequently, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Zhang Yue, a member of the Shandong Provincial Government, from Guling to ask him to personally inquire about the truth of this dispute and to discuss the aftermath. Han Dong (Zi Xianfang, Liu's chief of staff), the representative of Liu Zhennian, also went to Guling to meet with Chiang. It is heard that yesterday, Han Fuju and Chiang Bo-cheng both received telegrams from Chiang (Kai-shek) from Guling, stating that the issue of the aftermath in eastern Shandong has been ordered to Zhang Yue to go to Beijing to discuss specific solutions with He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs, and Zhu Peide, Chief of Staff. Li Yue, a major general参议 and Fan Yuhuang, a senior colonel 参谋, who were sent by the Ministry of Military Affairs to inspect the situation on the front line, are still in Beijing. It is heard that they will come to Jinan with Zhang Yue and then go to the front line for inspection. This morning, Chiang Bo-cheng took Chiang's telegram to the provincial government to meet with Han, who expressed his complete obedience to the orders of the central government and Chairman Chiang. Chiang (Bo-cheng) decided to return to Beiping this afternoon, as Zhang Yue, Li Yue, Fan Yuhuang and others would have to stay in Beijing for a few days before they could come to Jinan. When Zhang Yue and the other three set off from Beijing to the north, Chiang would also leave Beiping to the south to make final consultations with Han Fuju on the aftermath of the Jiaodong issue. Before Chiang Bo-cheng set off, I went to visit him. According to Chiang, the military affairs in eastern Shandong have indeed stopped, so he is taking the time to return to Beiping. As for the aftermath issue, Zhang Yue, a member of the committee, went to Guling to ask Chairman Chiang for instructions the day before and has gone to Beijing to discuss specific solutions with Minister He Yingqin. When he returns to Shandong, he will report to Chairman Han and implement them. At that time, Liu Zhennian will be directly ordered by the central government to comply. Li参议 (Yue) and Fan 参谋 (Yuhuang) are expected to come with Zhang and divide into two to inspect the military forces in eastern Shandong. I will return to Jinan in about four days. At 6:40 this afternoon, the 202 train to Pingpu set off to the north, and Chiang boarded the train and left.</p>
<p>As for the latest situation on the front line, according to a person from Shahe yesterday, the situation in Yexian has been quite tense in the past two days. Although the provincial army has surrounded Yexian on three sides, it has not actively attacked. However, the Liu army in the city occasionally fires machine guns, mortars, and mountain guns at the provincial army's defenses. It is even worse at night. Cao Fulin, the commander of the provincial army, in order to show the cessation of hostilities, did not order his troops to return fire. However, the Liu army recently set up cannons around the city and bombarded the provincial army's defenses with a barrage of fire. The sound of the cannons was loud and shook the surrounding areas. As a result, several soldiers of the provincial army were injured and three died. Cao Fulin, believing that Liu had violated the orders of the central government and sabotaged the ceasefire, issued a warning and had all the mountain guns, field guns, light and heavy mortars set up around the city with plenty of ammunition. The situation is extremely tense, and a war could break out at any moment. The Liu army has been fully assembled in Yexian and Laiyang. There is no trace of the Liu army along the coast (September 1st).</p>
<h3 id="e64">Recent Bombings in Tianjin <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲Four incidents in one night</p>
<p>▲May be related to the sale of Japanese goods</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Yesterday (29th) at 6:40 PM, someone placed a bomb on the right side of the glass window in front of Renchang Thread Store (i.e. foreign goods store) on Dongma Road. As it was near dusk and the market was gradually becoming lively, no one noticed the person who placed the bomb. When the colleagues at Renchang discovered it and were about to shout and warn, the bomb went off with a loud bang, and smoke filled the streets. Pedestrians were alarmed and fled in panic, and order was disrupted as a result. Shops closed their doors one after another. Zhang Keming, the 17th guard police officer of the Fourth Precinct in the area, blew his whistle to notify nearby posts to be on alert, and returned to the precinct to report. At 7:00 PM, the military police, security team, and police arrived one after another and immediately cut off traffic to search, but nothing was found. Traffic was restored at 7:30 PM. Unexpectedly, order had just been restored when bomb incidents occurred at Huazhu Woolen Store and Ruifuxiang Silk Store (also foreign goods) on Gu Yi Street, and at the Zhongyuan Company in the Japanese Concession. According to a staff member at Huazhu Store, at 7:35 PM, a rickshaw was speeding west with a young man about 20 years old wearing a dark blue cloth gown and a felt hat. As he passed the front of Huazhu's door, he threw something inside. The staff member knew something was wrong and was about to chase the person who threw the object, but a loud noise suddenly erupted in the store, making them stunned. After a while, when they regained consciousness, the rickshaw had disappeared. After investigation, Wu Zilun, a staff member at Renchang Store, was slightly injured in the face and more severely injured in the legs. Cui Hongkui, a pedestrian, was injured in his right leg, and Zhao Desan was injured in his left leg. The bomb shell flew to Fuxingcheng Leather Goods Store across the street, where Zheng San, an apprentice at the store, was injured in the throat and fainted on the spot with blood gushing out. He was sent to the Municipal Hospital, where he died shortly after. At Huazhu Store, Fei Runxuan, who served as an accountant and acting manager, was injured in the right eye and right leg. Jin Ruisheng, a staff member, was injured in both legs. Lu Shaoting was injured in the forehead, and Wang Shiqi, an apprentice, was injured in the back, and his condition was very serious. At 9:00 PM, Wang Yimin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, led special agents and police to Huazhu Store to inspect. A light yellow wooden handle was found inside Huazhu Store, proving that the object thrown was a hand grenade with a diameter of about four inches and a very strong explosive force. As for the situation at Ruifuxiang after the bombing, the store kept it strictly confidential. Neighbors said that they heard a loud bang, but it was not very loud, and it seemed to be a small bomb. Someone secretly placed a bomb in the piece goods department on the third floor of the Zhongyuan Company in the Japanese Concession. Fortunately, it did not explode. The store staff was very frightened after reporting the incident to the Japanese police station, who took the bomb away. That evening, each newspaper office received a public letter from the "Dare to Die Corps to Eliminate Traitors Behind the Front Lines," explaining the bombing situation and saying that there were more than 30 people working in Tianjin. If the unscrupulous merchants do not arouse their patriotic conscience again, there will be further treatment. (September 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Strict Anti-Communism in Guangzhou <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲Communist Bandits Plan Riot on Double Tenth Festival</p>
<p>▲Military and Police in City Implement Martial Law</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Communist bandits in western Jiangxi previously invaded Jiangkouwei in Shangyou, eyeing Chongyi and attempting to attack Nankang. The First Division of the First Army, stationed near Ganzhou, under Li Zhenqiu, dispatched troops. The Second Regiment of the division, under Wang Dao, after launching an attack, engaged the bandits in several battles, finally recapturing Yingqian on September 24th. On the 25th, Regiment Commander Wang reported by telegram that his regiment had occupied Yingqian (on the 24th). The communist bandits, numbering around 2,000 with over 1,000 rifles, were routed by our troops and fled in disarray towards Jingkeng and Guobu. A vast amount of military supplies were seized. Yingqian is a vital communication hub between Hunan and Jiangxi, occupied by communist bandits for many years. It was equipped with various political and military schools, making it the most complete organized area for communist bandits in southern Jiangxi. Its occupation by our regiment means the communist bandits west of Gan River in southern Jiangxi have lost their center, making a complete wipeout not difficult. Many refugees have returned to Yingqian. Our regiment is actively handling the aftermath, and local order is gradually being restored, it is said. After the communist bandits in various parts of southern Jiangxi were successively destroyed by the military, it has recently been reported that they are fragmenting into smaller units. Those in the southern Jiangxi area are avoiding the main force of the government army, employing small-scale raids. They are also secretly sending party members into major cities to disrupt, spy on military intelligence, or incite the military, aiming to disrupt the rear of the government army. There are also rumors of a large-scale riot around the Double Tenth Festival. Guangzhou has recently detected that the communist bandits are taking steps to cause trouble by first sending communist bandits into the city to open firewood and rice shops to secretly transport ammunition. They are also opening clothing stores so that tailors can get close to women in military and political circles to spy on military intelligence. They are dispatching henchmen to enlist in the army, engaging in military transport or plotting assassinations. Upon receiving the report, the Guangdong authorities, starting from the 25th, declared martial law by the headquarters of the First Army Group to strictly guard against any occurrences. The Public Security Bureau has also ordered each branch bureau to pay attention to newly opened small businesses within its jurisdiction.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Regarding the number of people, all newly opened businesses must seek a guarantor and specify the location of relocation for verification. Special attention must be paid to unfamiliar faces. Lower-class hotels, restaurants, boatmen lodging guests on the riverbank, and gathering places for coolies should be constantly investigated to prevent villains from sneaking in. After nightfall, military police and armed police from the Public Security Bureau will patrol in sections, and plainclothes detectives will be secretly dispatched to observe passersby. Anyone with suspicious behavior will be checked and questioned. The arrangements for maintaining city security are unusually strict. (September 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Course of Japanese Seizure of the Chinese Eastern Railway <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲Expanding Influence by Manipulating Puppet Organizations</p>
<p>▲Conflict with Soviet Russia Intensifies</p>
<p>The Chinese Eastern Railway was built thirty years ago by old Russia to invade the Far East and gain an outlet to the ocean, connecting the east with the Pacific Ocean. The completion of this railway greatly impacted Japan's coveting of Manchuria and Mongolia, leading to the Russo-Japanese War. Ultimately, Russia was defeated by Japan, ceding the section south of Changchun to Dalian to Japan, which was named the South Manchuria Railway. Since then, the Chinese Eastern Railway has been centered on Harbin, with the western line running from Manchuria Station to Harbin, the eastern line running from Ha East to Suifenhe on the Sino-Russian border, and the southern line running from Ha to Changchun. The entire line is 1,721 kilometers long. The railway passes through Manchuria Station into Russia, connecting with the Baikal-Amur Mainline, reaching Moscow and various European countries, becoming a direct route between Europe and Asia. The eastern line passes through Suifenhe into Russia, connecting with the Ussuri Railway, reaching Vladivostok and the Pacific Ocean. The southern line passes through Changchun to Dalian, entering the Yellow Sea. This railway connects Europe, Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and the Yellow Sea on three sides, and its impact on the economic development and military transportation of North and South Manchuria, the cultural communication between China, Japan, Russia, and various European countries, and the political changes in China, Japan, and Russia is extremely significant. Although this railway is nominally a Sino-Russian joint venture, it is in fact controlled and manipulated by the Russians in all aspects. The Chinese hold only nominal positions with no authority to intervene in anything. Since 1917, China has gradually taken back the rights attached to the railway to encroach on our country, including the right to protect the railway, military power, railway police power, municipal police power, judicial power, municipal administration power, navigation power, land rights, and education rights. The railway only managed train operation and transportation matters. After May 31, 1924, China and Russia signed the Outline of the Provisional Agreement on the Management of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the Feng-Soviet Agreement was signed on September 20 of the same year. The contents of these two agreements greatly harmed China's rights. The railway was nominally a joint venture, and Article 5 of the agreement stipulated that Chinese and Russian personnel should be equally distributed, but in fact, it was just a formality. Although China sent supervisors to oversee everything, all supervisors failed to fully implement the two agreements. This is because the Russians still adhered to the traditional thinking of aggression, and all systems, regulations, organizations, and texts of the Chinese Eastern Railway still followed the Russian organizational law, without being the same as the railway organization habits of China. Therefore, although China had sent experts to manage the railway (such as Wang Jingchun, who was the supervisor of the railway in 1922 and 1923 and hired many students studying in Europe and the United States), they were restricted by habits and were not proficient in Russian, so they could not implement the management of the railway. The Chinese side only placed more personnel, and the government only got extra profits every year. As for the management of train operation, the fare of passengers and goods, the conversion of gold rubles, and all important matters, the Russians were in charge of everything, and the Chinese side just watched it succeed.</p>
<p>Last year, after the September 18th Incident, when Ma Zhanshan fought fiercely with the Japanese army's Duomen Division on the Tao'ang Railway, Soviet Foreign Minister Karakhan protested to Japanese Ambassador to Russia Hirota, saying that the Japanese army should not cross the Chinese Eastern Railway line under any circumstances. Later, the Ma army was defeated and retreated, and the Japanese army ignored the Soviet protests and crossed the Chinese Eastern Railway line at Ang'angxi Station (it is said that Japan had obtained the understanding of the Soviet Union) and reached the capital of Heilongjiang Province. In January of this year, the Japanese army forcibly boarded a Chinese Eastern Railway train at Kuanchengzi Station (about ten miles from Changchun, the last station on the southern line of the Chinese Eastern Railway) and wanted to go north to Harbin. The Russian stationmaster refused to start the train, and the Japanese army shot and killed several Soviet and Chinese staff members and forcibly started the train. Although the Soviet consul in Harbin protested, it was of no use. The Japanese army drove to Shuangchengpu and fought with the troops of Ding Chao and Li Du, so the southern line was not open to traffic for more than ten days due to the war, causing great damage. On February 5th of this year, the Japanese army attacked and entered Harbin, and since then, the Japanese forces have completely reached northern Manchuria. At that time, the chief of the Japanese special agency, Doihara, had completely taken over or closed all Chinese agencies, such as the mayor of Harbin, and replaced him with the traitor Bao Guancheng. The director of the Binjiang Municipal Office was replaced by Zhao Bojun, the brother of the traitor Zhao Zhongren. The chairman of the Northeast Shipping Bureau was replaced by Ying Jihua. The traitor Zhang Jinghui, because he had contacted the Japanese earlier, was retained to serve later and continued to be the chief executive of the Eastern Special Zone. All other administrative, financial, educational, industrial, newspaper, and other agencies were changed or the Japanese were sent as advisors. Only the Chinese personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway have not been changed, and the Japanese have not intervened because they want to think about the Soviet Union's attitude.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese forces have reached northern Manchuria, they must want to take a share of the Chinese Eastern Railway. How could they not seize the rights of the Chinese side? However, the Japanese are still wary of the Soviet Union and dare not act rashly. On March 9th, the puppet state was established, and the traitor Puyi took office, so he intervened in the Chinese Eastern Railway and changed all the senior cadres of the Chinese side. This matter has a great relationship with the conflict between Japanese and Russian forces. I will describe it in detail. From the beginning, the annexation of the three northeastern provinces by the Japanese has not been supported by the countries of the world, especially the Soviet Union. This is an undeniable fact, so the Japanese have never dared to seize the rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway in a decisive manner like they seized purely Chinese agencies. The highest organ of the Chinese Eastern Railway is the board of directors, and the chairman of the board is concurrently held by the Chinese supervisor, with five Chinese and five Russian directors. Among the five Chinese directors, one is the chairman, and among the five Russian directors, one is the vice chairman. At this time, the Chinese Eastern Railway supervisor and chairman of the board was Mo Dehui. Because Mo was in Moscow and had not returned, his position was temporarily taken by Li Shaogeng. After the puppet state was established, the South Manchuria Railway strongly advocated that Lü Ronghuan should be the supervisor. Lü was the former supervisor, and the strongest advocate for Lü was the director of the South Manchuria Railway Office, Utsaku Umi. At the same time, the Japanese military部方面 advocated that a moderate attitude should be adopted towards the Soviet Union, because Lü still had traces of not being able to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union during the Sino-Soviet conflict in 1929. Li Shaogeng had real estate in Harbin worth more than one million, and he was very addicted to being an official and was afraid that his property would be confiscated if he was not an official for a day, so he contacted Uze Seishi, the director of the Eastern Railway Library, to run and campaign for him with the Japanese and the puppet state authorities. Uze was an old student of the Japanese Imperial University and was a member of the old National Assembly. He was one of the four great guardians of the Anfu faction when it was in power. He was a banner man and had a close relationship with Puyi, so he ran for Li Shaogeng. After Li became the supervisor, Uze jumped to become a counselor. (To be continued)</p>

<p>▲He Yingqin Speaks on How to Restore National Spirit and Status</p>
<p>At 9 a.m. on the 3rd, the Nanjing Office of the Central Party Headquarters held the Premier's Commemoration Week. Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Gu Mengyu, He Yingqin, He Yaozu, Zhang Daofan, Chen Zhaoying, and other staff members attended. After Gu Mengyu presided over the ceremony, He Yingqin reported on how to restore national spirit and status, saying that he would speak from the Premier's words on nationalism, "China is foolishly dreaming of relying solely on others." He stated that if we do not remove this foolish dreaming, the nation's future is extremely dangerous. We can only rely on ourselves and start with active preparation. The first step is to cultivate a great future from a spirit of peace, which means that the people must have healthy bodies and minds. Only after popularizing national physical education can we talk about resistance, survival, and competition. Last time, when conscripting the military police, only 25% of those examined were healthy. From this, it can be seen that no more than half of the Chinese population is completely healthy. Moreover, the mortality rate is too high, and the population is at risk of gradually decreasing. This is all because of a lack of attention to physical education and hygiene. It can also be said that education has failed, leading to a failure to popularize physical education and only creating a group of weak scholars. In the future, we must actively consolidate our national defense with the goal of self-defense, and we must quickly cultivate and improve the people's physical fitness. Therefore, I believe that the promotion of physical education and the establishment of hygiene facilities are extremely important. With national spirit, there will naturally be national status. In this way, the future of China will definitely be very promising.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Ministry of Finance Revises Banknote Issuance Tax <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲Tax Rate Revised to 1.25%</p>
<p>▲Tax Law Currently Being Reviewed by the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan, based on the revised Banknote Issuance Tax Law submitted by the Ministry of Finance, was brought up at the 66th Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd of last month, passed, and sent to the Legislative Yuan. On the 1st of this month, the Legislative Yuan meeting decided to hand it over to the Finance and Economic Committees for review. The contents of the Ministry of Finance's submission to the Executive Yuan and the draft amendment are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲Original Submission from the Ministry of Finance: The Banknote Issuance Tax Law was promulgated by the National Government on August 1, 1931, and the articles were copied and distributed by your esteemed Yuan on August 12 of the same year, ordering compliance. In accordance with this, the Ministry prepared for collection and ordered the issuing banks to comply with the tax rate. Subsequently, the China Communications Bank, the Zhongnan Bank, the Siming Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the China Reclamation Bank, and the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank jointly submitted a report, stating that according to the regulations of the Banknote Issuance Tax Law, the issuance tax should be paid at 2.5% of the 40% guarantee reserve, etc. After joint discussion and consultation, it was unanimously agreed that the issuance tax would affect the finances of the banks, and even though they had already assumed the burden, the Shanghai Banking Association submitted a reply on September 11, 1931. This matter has been put aside for years, and disasters have multiplied, and financial exhaustion has reached its peak. It is not easy to maintain and adjust. If heavy taxes are imposed again, it will directly affect the affairs of the banks and indirectly affect the national finances. The burden of each bank at this time is indeed painful. If this causes financial contraction, the result is unbearable. All kinds of difficulties have been repeatedly presented through elected representatives. Now, I will reiterate it to your esteemed ministry. Looking at the meager tax system of various countries, the benefits to the government are small, while the adjustment of currency is great. If we collect taxes at the current tax rate, I am afraid that finance will become tighter, which would lose the effect of adjustment and promote the proliferation of foreign currency. Furthermore, in terms of the banks themselves, since the January 28 Incident, their vitality has not recovered, and all industries have declined. It is undeniable that they are relying on finance for maintenance. If heavy taxes are imposed now, the banks can only take compensation from various industries, otherwise, they will inevitably shrink their loans, and the market will suffer. Moreover, the issuing banks all follow the prices set by the ministry when investing in guarantee reserve bonds. The national crisis suddenly occurred, and bond prices plummeted, and the accumulated losses from reorganization were also unaffordable. The smallness of the profit does not need to be stated clearly. I only hope that your esteemed ministry will take into account the overall planning of government affairs. At this time, the national treasury is extraordinarily short, and it is entirely reliant on opening up tax sources to help. Our banks have always relied on your protection. No matter how difficult it is, if it is within our power, we should take both into account and use our soil to help you. However, the tax rate of 2.5%</p>
<p>is really an excessive burden that the banks cannot bear. We can only truthfully ask your esteemed ministry to sympathize with the difficulties of businesses and consider the suffering of the people, and to give further consideration to quickly reduce the previously determined tax rate to no more than 1.25% of the guarantee reserve, and to quickly submit it to the Executive Yuan for consultation with the Legislative Yuan to revise the tax rate to relieve the hardships of businesses. According to the profit and loss reports sent by the banks at the end of last year, the China Bank had a net profit of more than 1,837,400 yuan, and the China Communications Bank had a net profit of more than 787,500 yuan. The China Bank should pay a tax of more than 1,535,574 yuan, and the China Communications Bank should pay a tax of more than 622,690 yuan. In comparison, the annual net profit of the two largest banks, China and Communications, is almost entirely used to pay taxes, and the others can be seen even more. It is true that the banks claim that the burden is too heavy and that they are unable to bear it. It is appropriate to reduce it to 1.25% of the guarantee reserve. It seems appropriate to approve the request in order to both benefit the national treasury and show concern for the hardships of businesses. In addition, the articles of other articles of the law are either slightly unclear or there are obstacles to implementation. They should be revised in accordance with the facts and principles in order to ensure that the law is established and the order is carried out without contradiction. In addition to approving the submission and requesting that the tax money for the 21st year still be paid according to the original tax rate, the reasons for revising the Banknote Issuance Tax Law are reasonably compiled into a clear memorandum and respectfully submitted to your esteemed Yuan for review and humbly request to transfer to the Legislative Yuan for review and request for promulgation and implementation.</p>

(4) Banks issuing exchange coupons shall fill in the issuance number and the number of cash guarantee reserves separately in accordance with the semi-monthly report form set by the Ministry of Finance and report them truthfully. The Ministry of Finance shall register the reported numbers separately on a semi-monthly basis and calculate the average number for twelve months after one year. (5) The tax rate for the exchange coupon issuance tax shall be set at 1.25% of the actual guarantee reserve amount for collection.

(8) If a bank does not comply with the Issuance Tax Law to pay the exchange coupon issuance tax, the Ministry of Finance may revoke its special issuance right. (9) If the Ministry of Finance considers the matters reported by the bank to be untrue, it may send personnel to inspect the issuance account and the reserve account. If there is indeed any concealment or underreporting, in addition to ordering payment, a fine of more than 500 yuan and less than 3,000 yuan shall be imposed. (10) Banks issuing exchange coupons shall pay the tax payable on the exchange coupons used by other banks together, but may recover it from the using bank.</p>

<p>(2) Quanzigou Coal Mine: This mine is located 63 li north of the county, about 3 li northwest of Shangyu Village. About 1 li northwest from Shangyu Village, the geological changes on the west bank of the Yellow River are extremely drastic, and faults and folds are quite complex. Ordovician limestone near the river is covered by the Carboniferous Permian coal system. Only near Quanzigou, the rock layers are flat and there are no changes. A horizontal adit is used to mine coal. The height of the adit is 3.5 to 5 feet, and the width is 3 to 4 feet. The length is about 160 zhang. The coal seam is about 6 feet thick. According to the foreman, this is the thickest part of the third coal seam, about 30 feet. This time, all three wells have not been seen. It is thought that it is a local change. The second coal seam is about 20 feet away from the second layer and is about 2 feet thick. The third coal seam is about 50 feet away from the first coal seam and the layer is about 1 foot thick. The strike is southeast and northwest, and the dip is from 0 to 5 degrees. The wood used for the coal lane pillars is about 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Three pieces of wood are used for each frame. The two sides of the stone lane are built with waste stone. There are very few places where wood is used for support. Each digger must dig 36 baskets of coal per shift. The wage is 300 copper coins. Each hauler is paid 12 copper coins for each basket hauled. Each person can haul 30 to 40 baskets per day. Each basket contains about 130 jin of coal. Food and lamp oil are provided by the workers themselves. The foreman earns 6 yuan a month. Food and lamp oil are provided by the mine owner. Each person needs about 3 jiao for food per day. Currently, about 100 baskets of coal are produced per day. The price of coal at the mine is 2 jiao per tan (240 jin) for powdered coal and 5 jiao per jin for lump coal. About 2,000 to 3,000 tan are sold each year. The mine tax is more than 30 yuan per year. The freight from the mine area to the Yellow River bank (ten li) is 2 jiao per carrying pole and 2.3 jiao per mule (each carrying pole about 200 jin). The tunnel uses natural ventilation, so mining has stopped because the wind is not circulating.</p>
<p>(3) Qiao'ergou Coal Mine: Located 5 li northwest of Shangyu Village and 65 li from the county seat. The coal is extracted from a vertical shaft, 4 feet in diameter and 130 feet deep. A horizontal adit is opened underground to the northeast for about 1,000 feet to mine coal. The ventilation shaft is more than 80 feet deep and uses natural ventilation. Each digger can dig 30 to 40 baskets of coal per shift. The wage is 300 copper coins. Each hauler can haul 30 to 40 baskets of coal (130 jin per basket) per shift. The wage is 300 copper coins. The eight windlass workers and one hooker above ground are paid 100 copper coins per shift. Food is provided by the workers themselves. There is very little lump coal. The price of raw coal is 1.5 jiao per tan. 30 to 40 tan can be sold per day. The wood used for support is about 4 inches in diameter and about 4 to 5 feet long. Each piece costs 1 jiao. Coal mining is temporarily suspended due to water. Bright lights are used underground, mostly burning rapeseed oil. The price of oil is 12 liang per yuan.</p>
<p>The geological age of Hancheng Coal Mine is Carboniferous Permian. The coal quality has been analyzed and the composition is fixed carbon 69.20 to 75.20, volatile matter 15.20 to 17.50, ash 6.80 to 9.60, sulfur 0.51 to 0.53, and calorific value 12000.</p>
<p>(4) Xigou Zhenyuan Coal Mine: Located 3 li west of Qiao'ergou. The Carboniferous coal system of Xigou is exposed on the side of the ditch, with more than 40 earth kilns. The current mine being mined is Zhenyuan Coal Mine, which is the largest in scale of all the mines examined this time. The mine owners are Li Xiaoguo and Yao Xinshan. The coal mine was bought in January of this year for 5,000 yuan. The coal pit is 200 feet deep and 4 feet in diameter. A horizontal adit is opened to the east and west from the bottom of the pit for 2,000 feet, and mining is carried out. The adit is 3 to 5 feet high and 2.5 to 4 feet wide. The coal seam is about 5 feet thick. The strike, dip, geology, coal quality, and ventilation are roughly the same as Qiao'ergou. Each digger digs 30 baskets per day. The wage is 300 copper coins. Each hauler hauls 40 baskets per day. The wage is 340 copper coins. Food and lamp oil are provided by the workers themselves. Currently, there are</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<p>three diggers, six haulers, one foreman, two windlass operators, three wheel pushers and one hooker (for a total of seventeen people) in the pit. The foreman's monthly salary is 20 yuan. The rest, except for the haulers, earn 300 copper coins per day (raw coal sells for 3 jiao per tan and the sales are very small. It is made into coke). The local area and Xi'an call it blue coal. It can be sold for 6 jiao per tan. The freight to Yumenkou (Yellow River bank), which is 15 li away, is about 4 jiao. Two jin of bituminous coal can make about one jin of coke. The coke oven is circular, 1 zhang in diameter and 7 feet deep. It can hold 40,000 jin of coal and produce about 20,000 jin of coke. The method is to fill the oven with 7 feet of coal and then build a wind tunnel on top with stones and cover it with coal ash. A fire door is opened on the lower side of the oven, and lump coal is used to start the fire. The fire is connected to all parts through the stone-built wind tunnel. Each oven can be burned for half a month. There are currently twelve or thirteen coke workers, each earning 5 yuan per month. However, those who build the stones earn 9 yuan per month. The water route from Yumenkou to Tongguan is 245 li, and the freight for every 100 degrees (24,000 jin) is about 112 yuan. The price of coke at Yumenkou is 130 yuan per 100 degrees. The water journey from Yumenkou to Baiyangzhai is about 334 li, and the freight for every 100 bundles is about 180 yuan. Each ship can carry dozens to four hundred bundles. The water depth of the Yellow River is usually about 2.5 feet, so the draft of the coal ship is at most 2 feet. Each large ship (carrying 400 bundles) costs about 800 to 900 yuan. Each ship employs about ten people. The land route from Baiyangzhai to Xi'an is about 110 li and is transported by livestock. The price of blue coal in Xi'an is usually around 3 yuan per 100 jin. The sandstone is very hard, so no support is needed. In addition, due to time constraints, the following were not examined: (1) Yushan Coal Mine: The coal quality is anthracite coal, which is mined by machine. The coal seam is about 24 feet thick and is located 110 li north of the county. (2) Ya Cha Coal Mine: The coal seam is about 6 feet thick and is located more than 80 li north of the city. (3) Qi Hu Chuan Iron Mine: Located more than 80 li north of the county. As for the water of Longmen, according to the surveyors, there is no electricity or anything else that can be used except for the passage of ships. However, the water of the Yellow River flowed to that place and was blocked by the big mountains, so the water had nowhere to go and flooded the fields, causing great harm. Yu then used divine skills to dig a mountain in half to allow the river water to flow. His great achievements are indeed an event that cannot be ignored for thousands of years.</p>

<p>▲Lawsuit Filed Regarding the Qingzhang Fee</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance ordered this county to collect the Qingzhang fee starting this year, at a rate of one jiao per mu, and any fraction less than one jiao would be counted as one mu. This has caused various sectors to send telegrams appealing for the actual collection to be fair. As there are no instructions from the provincial government to Songjiang, organizations such as the Old Songjiang Charity Board, the chairman of Zhang Zhihe, the director of the asset management office, Li Zuhua, the executive committee member of the Food Management Committee, Ni Guangku, and the head of the First District, Shi Zhongtai, have jointly filed a lawsuit with the provincial government in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Law of Appeal, requesting that your esteemed government repeatedly</p>
<p>charge the Qingzhang fee, and there is no explicit provision that any fraction of a mu should be counted as one mu. The Ministry of Finance has even more severely and additionally collected fees, causing the people to bear non-obligatory donations. It is found that the land registration forms in Songjiang County have many fractions of hao and li. If fractions are rounded up, it is not fair in fact and violates the principle of tax rate in law. Historically, the collection of local surcharges has always been based on land tax, and there has never been a precedent for rounding up. If this malpractice is started, it will not only violate the order of your esteemed government's resolution, but also conflict with the prohibition of surcharges. Moreover, the people of Songjiang County have suffered repeated collections in recent years and have been affected by the war again. The people's livelihood has been extremely depressed, and it is unbearable to collect fees beyond the limit. The damage to the people's rights is not small. For this reason, a lawsuit is filed in accordance with the Law of Appeal, attaching a blank receipt from the Songjiang Financial Bureau, appealing to your esteemed government to order the Ministry of Finance to comply with the general plan and order the Songjiang County government to verify the collection in accordance with the land tax standard in order to relieve the people's difficulties and conform to the general plan, which is truly beneficial, etc.</p>

<p>▲ Letter Requesting Restoration of Labor-Management Agreement. After the collapse of the silk factories in this county last year, tens of thousands of workers lost their jobs. It was hoped that work would resume with this year's spring harvest. However, harvests were poor in spring, summer, and autumn, and the silk market was sluggish. As a result, only about 20 silk factories in the county resumed operations, and some were only temporary. Due to the poor silk market, the wages of female silk factory workers could not be handled according to the previously agreed labor-management agreement. Therefore, the female workers requested the union to write to the employers to restore the agreement as soon as possible. The Organizing Committee of the Silk Factory Industry Union, Standing Committee members Xu Abao and Wang Dafu, based on the requests of the female workers, sent a letter to the Silk Factory Association yesterday (the 2nd) for their consideration and action.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Preliminary Ideas on Reforming Chinese School Education <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>(5) Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>To supplement what is most important, the nation should quickly create more specialized primary education for the majority of the national population and productive elements. It is insufficient because many people did not have educational opportunities in the past and are now too old to attend primary school. Therefore, adult supplementary education should be used to make up for the deficiency in primary education. The length of study for such adult supplementary education institutions can be three months, half a year, or a year. They should also focus on both national knowledge and production skills. Since these two factors are not within the proper scope of this article, I will not elaborate.</p>
<p>The more primary schools that can truly cultivate healthy citizens and increase productive capacity, the better, because students from these primary schools will never become unemployed vagrants. Many of the current primary schools are private, and most are county-run. There are very few provincial schools, and there are absolutely no national schools. Many people believe that the state should focus on higher education, while primary education should be left to local or private organizations. I believe that while the state should focus on higher education, it should pay even more attention to primary education, because primary school is the foundation of education and the foundation of all politics and society. If primary schools are not run well, education will be poor, and politics and society will never improve. Especially in China, achieving the goal of universal national education cannot be accomplished by the financial resources of local or private organizations alone. Therefore, the state and provinces should allocate large sums of money to subsidize primary schools run by cities, counties, or private individuals. This funding should also be increased annually, with a deadline set so that national education is truly universal. Other agencies can be cut or merged, and government spending can be tightened, but this funding should absolutely not be saved or cut because this is the business to which China's future destiny is entrusted.</p>
<p>The intermediate education stage should include education for production, teachers, and the preparation of talent. Intermediate education is different from primary education. Primary education only has one type of school, namely primary school. Intermediate education can be divided into three types of schools with different characteristics: vocational schools, which focus on production education; normal schools, which focus on teacher education; and middle schools, which focus on preparing talent.</p>
<p>Chinese educators have advocated vocational education for more than a decade, and various provinces have established many vocational schools. But what is the effect? It can be said that most have failed. Since they are called vocational schools, their primary purpose is to enable graduates to produce and have proper occupations. However, the graduates of current vocational schools either go on to higher education if their families are well-off, or most join the ranks of the unemployed in society, searching for work all day long in a state of anxiety. A small number of those who have jobs are not at all related to the education they received in school. For example, graduates of industrial schools do not work in factories but become teachers in primary schools. Graduates of agricultural schools do not farm but work as clerks or secretaries in government offices. People who truly study a field and then work in that field are probably one in a hundred. Given this phenomenon, can it be said that past vocational schools were not a complete failure? We have studied the reasons for the failure of vocational schools. First, before the opening of each vocational school, the people in charge rarely have a precise plan for what kind of people society needs and what kind of people vocational schools should cultivate. They only follow their intuition in a general way. They feel that China's agriculture is not developing, so they open an agricultural school. They feel that China's industry is not developed, so they open an industrial school. As a result, the people created by the schools are not needed by society, and the people needed by society are not cultivated by the schools. Second, current vocational schools, like other schools, focus on book research and neglect practical skills. Students in agricultural schools sit in lecture halls listening to teachers talk about how to farm. Students in industrial schools sit in lecture halls listening to teachers talk about how to work. Even if students work very hard in such education, the result is the creation of waste. I have visited several vocational schools and personally seen that the rice seedlings transplanted by graduating students of agricultural schools are crooked and uneven, far inferior to those planted by uneducated farmers. The tools made by graduating students of industrial schools are rough and crude, far inferior to those made by uneducated workers. No matter how many such agricultural schools and industrial schools are run, they will naturally not affect China's agriculture and industry, and they will not be able to help students become productive elements. To correct these problems, I advocate that vocational schools should not be divided into departments such as agriculture, industry, and commerce. Instead, they should be divided into many different classes. They should open classes for the kind of people society needs, and they should not create people that society does not need. Second, vocational schools do not need to rigidly stipulate a graduation period of three, four, or five years. The length of study should be completely determined by the time required to train a certain production skill. Type A occupations may only require three months of training, and students can graduate in three months. Type B occupations may require half a year, Type C may require two years, and Type D may require five or six years. Even for the same occupation, if A wants to learn it well, it will take a year, while B only needs to learn a little and will only need half a year. Third, vocational schools should absolutely focus on skills training, with book teaching being secondary. Because the purpose of vocational schools is to create productive elements, not to cultivate specialized talents. What is most needed for ordinary production is practical skills, not principles. Therefore, it does not matter if students in vocational schools know less about principles. If they lack production skills, that is a fundamental loss of the meaning of vocational schools.</p>

<p>To Mr. Mo, Chairman of the South China Athletic Association: Please negotiate with the China and Guangzhou football teams to form a South China United Team to come to Shanghai for a competition to raise funds for relief for the Northeast righteous armies. We sincerely hope you will mediate and facilitate their trip. If there are difficulties, we would also welcome South China to come alone, but we must request that Brother Li Huitang accompany them to add luster and attract attention. Travel expenses and board will be provided by the local righteous army support association, but we hope for the utmost frugality.

<p>▲ Scheduled for November 13th</p>
<p>China's race walking history is long and its achievements are commendable. Recently, the National Sports Advancement Association approved the opportunity to participate in the 1936 World Games. However, in order to raise public awareness, it is imperative to actively promote the sport. Therefore, Mr. Shen Siliang instructed the China Race Walking Association to proceed quickly. The association, in view of this, held a meeting at the Moore Memorial Church last night to discuss the arrangements. Those present included Shi Youhui, Shi Jinsheng, Zhou Yuyu, Wang Gang, Lu Yutian, and Ai Jieke, among others, totaling over thirty people. Chairman Shi Youhui presided over the discussion, and it was decided that a thirteen-mile open race walk would be held in Shanghai on November 13th. At the same time, a women's mile race walk will also be held. Registration is open to the association from today, with a registration fee of three jiao for men and free for women, to promote women's sports. To increase interest, the event will be divided into team and individual categories. Teams will consist of four people. All those who complete the course within the allotted time (two and a half hours) will receive prizes to encourage participation. Participants must be at least sixteen years old. The numbering of the mileage along the route will be handled by the Ai Jieke Bureau. The first practice session will be held this Sunday (the 9th). It is reported that donations of prizes have been very enthusiastic. At the time, the Juvenile Goods Supply Company, Gang, Shanghai Standard Sports Equipment Company, Chen Yuze, and Ai Jieke each pledged to donate a large silver cup. It is said that the association has drafted letters to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the authorities of the British and French concessions regarding road traffic.</p>

<p>The Shanghai YMCA has a sports field located near the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Dixiwei Road, equipped with a football field, basketball court, tennis court, running track, and all kinds of sports equipment. The transportation is convenient and the location is open and spacious, making it an ideal place for practicing sports. The YMCA, recognizing the dense population and high land prices in Shanghai, which leads to a lack of sports facilities, has leased the field to schools and organizations, thus benefiting society and nurturing sports talents. Now that the autumn football season is in full swing in Shanghai, many organizations have contacted the YMCA to lease the field. However, after scheduling practice times, there are still some slots available. Those who wish to lease the field are requested to contact the YMCA soon. This announcement is made to inform the public. The contact location is the Sports Department of the Shanghai YMCA on Sichuan Road. The contact time is from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>During the game, if a player fails to hold the ball and it slips out of bounds, or if someone dribbling the ball fails to stop immediately and slides out of bounds, or if the ball slips out of bounds due to a careless mistake, it is not only detrimental to the team but also lengthens the opponent's attack, as the opponent gets to throw the ball back in.</p>
<p>The following are some rules: (1) If any part of a player's body touches the outside of the boundary line or the end line, the ball is out of bounds. (2) If any part of the ball touches the boundary line, the floor, or bounces outside the field, the ball is out of bounds. (3) If a player within the boundary line touches the ball and causes it to go out of bounds, the ball is also out of bounds.</p>
<p>After the ball goes out of bounds, the game is restarted by a player from the opposing team that caused the ball to go out of bounds standing outside the boundary line and throwing the ball to a teammate. If the thrower dribbles the ball into the field or touches the ball again after it enters the field without being touched by another player, or if they fail to throw the ball in after five seconds, the referee will whistle and award the ball to the opposing team (the one who originally caused the ball to go out of bounds) to throw it in from outside the boundary line.</p>
<p>If officials are unable to determine which team caused the ball to go out of bounds, the referee may choose two players from the two teams to jump for the ball at a point one yard inside the boundary line, directly at right angles from where the ball went out.</p>

<h3 id="e97">If Gandhi Were in China <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Ji</p>
<p>The committee to support the League of Nations covenant in this city sent a letter urging Mr. Xiang Laoren to take the post of honorary member; because the letter mentioned imitating Gandhi's non-cooperation movement, Xiang Laoren told me the following:</p>
<p>If Gandhi were in China, how would he save China? The so-called non-cooperation movement would have to change its methods? I will tell you the reasons in two layers; but in the end, it's like the saying: the same old story!</p>
<p>First, the problem of national belief. You must understand that religious power can transform the people into customs and unite the people's hearts. Gandhi is very religious in India; the general Indian people regard him as a devout religious figure: so this kind of personality is enough to call on the people. Think: Ireland also demanded autonomy from England in the same way, and now it has regained autonomy; because most Irish people are Catholic! Gandhi's actions would not attract the same sympathy from Chinese people with weak beliefs; therefore, another method must be devised.</p>
<p>Second, the problem of local customs. Our country has a vast territory and a large population, and the customs of the north and south are different: the northeast is ravaged by Japan, and the southwest's attitude is the same as usual; the anti-Japanese war in Shanghai is fierce, but Japanese goods are thriving in Tianjin. It is very shameful to say: the kneeling and crying groups' weeping and kowtowing, how have the consciences of the unscrupulous merchants awakened: Gandhi must think of another ingenious plan for these numb Chinese people!</p>
<p>If Gandhi were really born in China, and lived to be over ninety years old like me, and understood our people's customs, I hope he would cooperate with me: to correct people's hearts by preaching the Ten Commandments, and to promote local baojia [household registration system] and implement self-government. Luan Cheng's essay on civil administration says that in ancient times, the Three Elders and Se Fu [local officials] were used to ridicule and teach the unworthy elements of their townships and counties; now, if we promote people's autonomy, the unscrupulous merchants will not be able to escape the public judgment of their neighbors and fellow villagers!"</p>
<h3 id="e98">Internal Disaster <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Ah Hong</p>
<p>Starting from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</p>
<p>The demise of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, its fatal wound was internal disaster. After reading Shi Dakai's poems, one cannot help but sigh! However, this was not accidental: thinking of that group of heroes from the wilderness, they originally started their own business, and what they said about comforting the people and punishing the guilty was just propaganda and a means of calling on the people. Where was it true! Therefore, once they gained power, they indulged in fine wine and women, and fought for power and profit! For the sake of personal grievances, even if it harmed the country and the people, they would not care! They monopolized the power of victory, and if they failed, they would return to being rogues. What was impossible! However, this was eighty years ago, when the world was a one-surname family. The winner is king, and the loser is a bandit, which has nothing to do with the common people. But now it is different: the master is our 400 million people! Even if Cao Cao were reborn, he would say: I am a public servant! I am a pioneer for the people!</p>
<p>However, the internal disaster in our country now is even worse than that of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom! And the foreign troubles are even greater than they were then! Before, the people did not know that they could use their power, but now we have power, but we never use it, which is regrettable!</p>
<p>Compatriots! Don't be willing to be plague gods or Adou [incompetent rulers] again, shrinking your heads, clenching your teeth, and enduring it! Honestly and impolitely exercise your power as masters! Let's immediately issue an urgent decree ordering our public servants:</p>
<p>First, if you still feel that you are our public servants, you should immediately stop the civil war, go to the border, and aim your guns at the enemy!</p>
<p>Second, if you insist on being brave and ruthless against your own people, then please immediately take down your public servant sign and go to the circus, bullfighting arena, or set up your own arena! Feel free to show off your skills and fight for territory! But don't tarnish us by fighting under our banner! Fellow men and women: wake up! If we don't sanction them: they will show off their power until they are satisfied, but they cannot share the pain of being slaves to a conquered nation for you!</p>

<p>This Era Is Ours</p>
<p>Old Zhang said: "It's getting cold, shouldn't those women walking on the street with their legs bare put on their socks? I said: "No, socks are not worn even in winter. Because even old women's legs may not get frostbite."</p>
<p>"Even their thighs are bare, their buttocks swaying in cheongsams, almost not wearing pants, what is this?"</p>
<p>"But, if there is no considerable healthy beauty and youthful blood color, they would never want to be exposed."</p>
<p>"The most important things for women are their chests, bellies, and buttocks. How to make them develop freely and fully, and how to make them show off, are all important. That is to say, you want natural beauty, posture, and the undulation of curves."</p>
<p>"Is black, yellow, and brown skin also considered beautiful? Isn't that just seducing carnal desire and not wearing pants? If they ran out of a brothel, or are street prostitutes, there's nothing to be surprised about, but these are actually ladies from respectable families and female students! Degeneracy, incredible degeneracy! Our moral culture is on the road to extinction!"</p>
<p>"But, please don't say that. Because it's because of this era! It is said that in the big era, everything is changing, is leaping, it is said that the children of the era are standing at the forefront, showing the lively power of youth, so as women, they are returning to the primitive, free, semi-nude state."</p>
<p>"But I don't know why, I always feel a little worried," said Old Zhang.</p>

<p>"...Chef He is really damned seven times! So few dishes for a table of seven people; the meat slices are cut so thin, and the fish are picked so small, how is that enough to eat? The meal money was paid long ago when school started, I wonder how much he's going to pocket!..."</p>
<p>"...We have simple tea and plain rice for three meals a day, it's really not easy. If we switched to a government job, even with 30% of our monthly salary, we would still be two months in debt. Maybe we wouldn't even have a long gown!..."</p>

<p>— Cao Lifang</p>
<p>Just Because the "Small" Is in Power</p>
<p>This journal published Feng Jun's article "The 'Small' Is in Power" nine issues ago, and after further investigation, I am filled with emotion! Because "the 'small' is in power" has created the bad result of the "big" getting tricked. Now, I will elaborate on some of the examples cited by Feng Jun:</p>
<p>The psychology of us Chinese people, especially, is characterized by the "big." It is almost universally built on the foundation of loving the "small." Just look: the "big" person's most beloved is not his wife, but his "small" wife. But not every "small" wife is able to receive the "big" person's love and reciprocate it with heartfelt affection, without looking elsewhere; the "big" official's usual residence is not his official residence, but his "small" mansion, but the beauties inside the "small" mansion do not necessarily consider the "big" official's financial burden and live a frugal life, in order to reduce his extravagant 金屋式 [referring to the extravagant lifestyle of keeping a mistress]; "the 'small' ones" among the prostitutes possess seductive magic, especially being able to make "big" young masters with huge fortunes spend money like water. Once the money is gone, they will refuse to see guests; "the 'small' ones" with white faces among boyfriends are especially able to move people to pity, especially being able to make "big" family daughters who are obsessed with beauty fall in love at first sight. Once their bodies are defiled, they will be discarded without hesitation; as for the psychology of people who read "small" newspapers, they completely misunderstand reading newspapers as a way to relieve boredom and forget the more important meaning of reading newspapers. As a result, the sales of "big" newspapers are inevitably affected, so that our country's news industry is still lagging behind in the international arena!</p>
<p>Speaking of the country, our "big" China, because the "small" eastern neighbor is "in power," the result of "big" China being "tricked" is that, to this day, the disaster of national subjugation is imminent! Can we still not wake up, but continue to cling to our inherent psychology of loving the "small," feeling that the "small" eastern neighbor is "small" enough to be pitiful, "small" enough to be cute, without thinking of slightly changing its bad nature and fighting to the death with this "small" eastern neighbor, who is our country's enemy and the world's public enemy?

<h3 id="e102">In Pursuit of Happiness with Fellow Travelers (4) <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— The Master of Happiness</p>
<p>"Oh! Yizhen, you finally came!" He jumped up suddenly, grasped the hand of the person behind him, and asked anxiously: "I don't mind waiting a little longer, but I was just thinking that you agreed to meet me here at four thirty yesterday to talk. You would never break your promise for no reason, so something must have happened. I've been worried sick about you here!"</p>
<p>After saying those words, the young man held the visitor's hand tightly, unwilling to let go, and focused his eyes on her for a good, long look. The visitor was a woman, wearing a fish-white bamboo cloth short jacket, tied with a green crepe short skirt, white long stockings, and black leather shoes. She was an extremely plain female student. Her hair had been cut short, and a neat fringe of short hair covered her forehead, making her look like a young Western girl. A pair of black, shiny, round eyes, a nose like a hanging gallbladder, and naturally rosy cheeks made her look like a truly innocent and lively young girl of sixteen or seventeen. But at this golden age, when she should be happy and lively, she now showed a hint of melancholy for some reason.</p>
<p>He saw all of this – her appearance and expression – very clearly in an instant and couldn't help but ask: "Ya, your complexion is very bad; I guessed correctly, you must have encountered some adversity in your family again. Don't bottle it up, tell me quickly!" The girl lowered her head and slowly replied in a very quiet voice: "Boqin, you guessed right; I, with my extremely lonely and unfortunate destiny, have now encountered an extremely serious turn of events. You know my background very well. I am an orphan with no parents, relying on my uncle to live. I am determined not to rely on them too much, and I am trying my best to get some knowledge and learn some skills, so I can open a path for myself and find an independent occupation. Even when I usually receive some cold looks from my aunt and uncle and suffer some grievances, I think of them as temporary and insignificant hardships that I can avoid sooner or later, so I can put up with them and just get by. But what I am encountering today is not so ordinary and simple! My aunt and uncle insist on carrying out some kind of "qinshang" [interference from relatives] and taking charge of my marriage. My aunt is even worse, a wicked and materialistic woman from the lowest of brothels. She has bewitched my uncle, saying that she is helping him find connections to become an official, and she spends day and night outside socializing with officials' wives. She can't get close to the wealthy, so she hangs out with the adjutants and orderlies of high-ranking military officers.</p>

<p>Strong Fluctuations in Financial and Gold Markets</p>
<p>▲ Daily Difference Reached Twelve Taels: Yesterday's gold market fluctuated greatly, rising and falling sharply in an unpredictable manner. The difference for the day was as much as twelve taels. In the end, it fell four taels compared to last Saturday. Various firms offered more than they demanded, and the situation was intense. Initially, the Bank of America and the First National Bank of New York reported declines, so the price immediately rose. Then it fell slightly. The foreign exchange market appeared tight on the surface but was actually relaxed. Suddenly, a storm arose. It was said that Dalian drafts had fallen sharply, and the Dalian gang took the opportunity to sell. As for Japanese banks, etc., they sold US dollars, so the exchange rate became loose. However, gold companies bought back to cover short positions. It was also rumored that Japan was dissatisfied with the League of Nations report and that a certain important person in Peiping had been poisoned, which caused increased selling pressure from all sides and led to a sudden reversal, with a sense of freefall. The price plummeted more than ten taels. By noon, it seemed to stabilize, and the market rose and fell slightly, at most two taels. The central bank intervened with more than 600 bars of spot goods, priced at 26.5 to 27 taels, which was sold by Run Chang Yu and others. Later, it stood between 728 taels. The details of the market before and after are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ The morning market opened at 736 taels and 3 mace for November, a rise of 4 taels and 3 mace, amid unstable jumps and falls. The silver price fell another eighth yesterday, and the private telegram was sixteen and three-sixteenths. The forward price was slightly higher by two li. It was expected that the high price was already priced in. Heng Yu, Zhi Feng, Yong Yuan Mao, Yong Shen Kang, and others all continued to buy at 37 taels. Soon, Yi Feng, Da De Cheng sold to cover the spread. Heng Yu, Yong Feng, Zhao Fa Chang, Yi Feng Yong, and others came to sell, with the US dollar seemingly looser. In October, banks initially bought at 30.025 yuan, then sold. Zhong Fu sold November at 31.125. Banque Belge sold British pounds this month at 19. Mitsui sold US dollars in December at half a yuan. At 9:20, it was 35 taels and 1 mace. When HSBC quoted, the British and US dollars each contracted by 125, it was 36 taels. Yuan Heng bought. Later, the internal market became looser. The US dollar for January could be settled at 625. Zhao Feng Chang, Heng Yu, Fu Yu, Yuan Da, Yong Hong, Li Da Xing, Yong Yi Feng Yong, etc., sold heavily, and it was rumored that the central bank was also selling. However, the Dalian gang bought because they were hedging. There were various unfavorable rumors about the gold market in Dalian. Rumors flew, and people were shocked. The price plummeted by 6 taels, reaching only the 30 tael mark at around 11:10. Soon after, the foreign exchange market became even looser. Sassoon bought and sold advance orders at 125. Shanghai sold US dollars this month at 5625. The selling pressure in the market was even stronger. Hong Kang Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Heng Yu, Yuan Chun, Fu Tai Heng, Bing Xing Fu Yu, Guang Feng Chang, Zhi Feng Yong, Yi Feng Yong, etc. were selling. A sad atmosphere filled the trading floor. It continued to fall sharply. Around 11:40, it was 25 taels and 2 mace. Later, Rui Xing, Hong Li, Yuan Da, Yong Yi Feng Yong, etc., all bought. Heng Xing bought again and again. The US dollar returned to par. Banque Belge absorbed January at 8125 and bought, pulling the price up by more than 2 taels. At 11:45, it was 27 taels and 6 mace. Chun Yuan Yong and others came to sell, so the noon closing was 26 taels and 9 mace, adding another 2 mace. Then Heng Xing bought again.</p>
<p>▲ The scope of fluctuations in the afternoon market narrowed. The afternoon market opened at 27 taels, then fell from 7 taels and 4 mace to 6 taels because Yuan Mao Yong Yi Feng Yong Qian Heng and others sold. The British pound for this month was 25, and for December was 375. Then it rose by more than 1 tael. Yi Feng Yong, Bing Xing, etc., bought at 27 taels and 1 mace. Suddenly, Zhao Feng Chang and Tong Tai Chang sold, and it fell back to 25 taels and 6 mace. Soon, the Bank of America bought US dollars for December at 625. For this month, half a yuan could be bought and sold. Heng Xing and Yi Feng bought.</p>
<p>Therefore, the price was raised by more than 2 taels. At 2:45, it was 28 taels. In an instant, Zhi Feng Yong Heng Yu Chun Yuan Yong Fu Tai Heng and others came to sell. The US dollar for January at 9375 was not easy to sell. The central bank sold US dollars for November at 6875. At 3 o'clock, it finally became 25 taels and 3 mace. After a while, Banque Belge absorbed January at 9375. The central bank intervened with another 420 bars of spot goods, so it immediately rose two or three taels. Heng Yu Zhao Feng Chang Zhi Feng Yong and others went to the market to buy. The silver company also absorbed 6875 for December. Until 4:15, it was 28 taels and 3 mace. However, there was a difference of more than one tael up and down. After entering, it was a little less by seven or eight mace. Many retail long positions were unwinding. However, the outside market was still good. The bank wanted US dollars for December at 75. Heng Xing planned to buy, but there were very few notes, making it difficult to respond. It rose again to 8 taels and 3 mace. At 4:30, the market closed at 8 taels and 1 mace, then rallied to 8 taels and 8 mace. Compared to the end of last week (according to the listed price), it still fell by 3 taels and 9 mace. The maximum for the day was 37 taels, and the minimum was 25 taels and 2 mace, a difference of 11 taels and 8 mace. Looking back at the red figures, it added 9 taels and 75.</p>
<p>▲ The announced price was mostly suppressed by 7 taels. The price increase was due to the US dollar falling slightly by 125, so it was counted as 803 taels. The quoted price was 678 taels, then 78 taels. The noon closing was 756 taels, and the afternoon was 767 taels to 78 taels. The result was 75 taels, 7 taels more than last Saturday. The log was 29 taels, the water supplement for 27 taels, and the afternoon was 28 taels. ▲ The transactions on the table were extremely busy, with many transactions, but the inflows and outflows were uneven. According to statistics, Yuan Da Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Heng, Yuan Kang Xiang, Heng Xing, Wan Xing, Rui Xing, and Shun Li all bought. Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Xing Yong, and Hong Li had uneven inflows and outflows. Heng Yu, Zhao Feng Chang, Fu Yu, Hong Kang Yong, Yu He, Fu Tai Heng, Yi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Da Xing Yong, Yi Feng, Chun Yuan Yong, Da De Cheng, and Zhi Ti Yong all sold. In the afternoon, Hong Li, Heng Xing, Yi Feng, Yong Feng, Yu He, and Yuan Heng all bought. Heng Yu and Zhao Feng Chang sold and then bought again. There were many transactions. Bing Xing and Zhi Feng Yong sold one after another. Yuan Da Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, Qian Heng, Heng Chang Yong, and Fu Tai Heng all sold. Wan Xing, Shun Li, Yuan Chun, and Da De Cheng sold and bought from time to time. The rest were complicated. The Dalian gang bought more than 700 bars and sold more than 300 bars. The Guang gang Heng Xing bought more than 1,400 bars in total. Yi Feng had only about 200 bars of inflows and outflows.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Foreign Exchange Market Appears Tight, But Actually Rising; Bank Transactions Were Quite Active <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the beginning of the week, and the silver market had no telegrams. The HSBC listing in this port contracted by half a block, with British and American currencies each contracting by 125. The rest also contracted. The internal trend was reversed, mainly due to the impact of the sharp fall in Dalian drafts. The morning market was still firm, then quite sluggish. The noon market was particularly sluggish. The result was moderate. Compared to last Saturday, the British pound rose by 0.0625, and the US dollar rose by 0.125. This is what is meant by "apparently contracting, but actually releasing". The gold market had been turning sluggish from being sharp for many days. In the end, the transactions of various banks within 30 taels were quite active. It is estimated that 100,000 pounds of British pounds were traded. The British-American Tobacco Company slightly settled accounts. Sassoon sold December. The gold firms cleared inflows and outflows, and the US dollar was about 1 million or more. Gold firms hedged against short positions in the morning market and sold slightly in the afternoon. There were many hedgers. Japanese banks sold US dollars in large numbers because they had absorbed Dalian drafts. The central bank sold about 200,000 yuan. It was rumored that it had hedged into cash, and the silver company bought long-term ones. Mobil Oil Company bought forward ones, so the market was not without pulling.</p>
<p>▲ The intraday range for the British exchange internal market was 1875, ranging from the opening price of 1 shilling and 8 pence in October, 19375 in November, 7 pence and 0625 in December, and 125 advance payment for January. The buying price was 9 pence. The selling price at noon was 9 pence 125 to 3125, and the buying price was 1875 to 375. The closing price in the afternoon was the same as the noon price.</p>
<p>▲ The range of fluctuation in the internal market of the US exchange rate during the day was 4375, ranging from the opening selling price of 30 yuan 125 in October, 25 in November, 375 in December, and half a yuan in January. The buying price was based on the monthly addition of 125. The selling price at noon was 30 yuan to 875, and the buying price was 625 to 1 yuan. The closing selling price in the afternoon was 30 yuan 4375 to 8125, and the buying price was 5625 to 9375. Also, one US dollar is equal to three taels, three mace, four fen, and two seventy-eighths of silver.</p>

<p>In the silver and money industries, there must be a large number of long-term settlements or new loans every year in March and September. Since the business community adopted the Gregorian calendar in the 18th year of the Republic, it has been changed to April and October. Now that the time for the October event has arrived again, the qianzhuang side has slightly saved long-term settlements in the past few days, with an estimated amount of about 3 million. The amount of long-term debts due is more than 1 million. There are many transfers, and the number of settlements is less than 1 million. As for the price, there is currently no certainty. Roughly speaking, there must be a kind of fixed price announcement when a large number of them are collected. According to silver and money industry news, not many loans were released in the previous session (April), and this time there may be no special impact from the collection.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Securities and Bonds Rose and Fell <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The trend is chaotic, with 4.9 million in transactions</p>
<p>Only Salt Tax opened in November</p>
<p>Yesterday (3rd), at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, only Salt Tax was transacted in the spot market in the morning for 1,000 yuan. There were no other transactions. The market for futures contracts was still good. The market was active. Only Salt Tax had some transactions in November futures, and the rest were still inactive. It is estimated that more than 2.9 million were transacted in the morning, and about 2 million in the afternoon. When various bonds opened in the early morning, the market was still good, and customer receipts were not deserted. Various bonds, such as demobilization bonds, once rose by six or seven corners, but the market suddenly falsely reported that the pseudo-police in Yuguan were provoking trouble, and the situation was tense. Selling became smoother, and demand was weak. Therefore, it instantly fell back. The two markets fluctuated uncertainly in the afternoon. The result was that the changes compared to the previous day were very slight.</p>

<p>The Sin Fung Trading Company reported that the New York stock market opened firmly last Saturday (1st), then fell slightly, but industrial stocks and utility stocks still rose back. According to the report, the number of freight cars in the week from September 18th to 25th was 595,746, an increase of 8,444 compared to the previous week. However, due to the possibility of liquidation of nickel plates and railways and the fact that today is the Jewish New Year, the market did not change much, and transactions were extremely rare. The total number of transactions in half a day was only 338,300 shares. Observing the market situation, it seemed extremely chaotic. The amount of steel work and the number of freight cars (production and distribution) continued to be good, and it was expected that there would be further progress in the future. However, due to the sluggishness of prices, the instability of the political situation, and the rapid announcement of the third quarter profit report, the future of first-class bonds can be looked forward to because interest rates will continue to be very low. The Dow Jones index for the 1st is listed on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market was extremely scattered and lacked any excitement. The actual needs of foreign merchants felt more sluggish, and there was no vitality from all sides. The daily ups and downs in the market were within 5 qian. The market was wooden, and both long and short positions were waiting for changes before taking action.</p>
<p>▲ Neither Long nor Short Positions Took Action: When the human marker opened in the morning, the US cotton fell again, and the market was scattered. The price for each month fell by 4, 5 qian. The two or three markets rose back again. As a result, the price for each month fell slightly by 1, 2, 3 qian. The market opened in the afternoon, and rumors spread in the market, causing a two or three market drop, but then it gradually rose again. The near month rose by 1, 2 qian, and the far month fell by 2, 3 qian. The total number of transactions for the day was 9,000 bales. According to the investigation, Yi Chang sold 1,200 bales, Ming De 800 bales, and Ji Feng bought 500 bales, Tong Fu 400 bales, Chang Feng 750 bales, and Yi Yu 450 bales.

<p>The cotton market in recent months has been relatively firm, because the amount of short selling is too large and the time is approaching. Moreover, the domestic climate is favorable, and new cotton is gradually being listed in various places. However, the receiving price in various producing areas is still firm, and rural farmers are unwilling to sell cheaply, so general scattered shorts have slightly hedged, and the market has been slightly firm. However, the current cotton mills are all watching and unwilling to purchase, so current cotton transactions have been suspended again.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Marker Shows a Slightly Soft Trend: The Zheng marker opened in the morning, and the US cotton fell again, and the market was very tired. The price for each month fell by 2, 3 qian. The two or three markets retail hedges, and October was tight again. As a result, it rose by 5 fen to 2 qian. The market in the afternoon fell slightly by 5 fen to 2 qian. The total number of transactions for the day was 52,500 dan. According to the investigation, Da Fu sold 2,800 dan, Rui Da 2,200 dan, Yuan Da 4,100 dan, and Xin Cheng 1,200 dan.

<p>(1st) Tianjin News: The Xihe flower market's atmosphere is excited and falling because foreign telegrams are bad, and the exchange rate is also unfavorable. Because the market conditions are not good, sales are extremely rare. Foreign merchants bought 150 bales, opening at 24 taels and 23 taels and 5 qian, slightly lower by 5 qian to 1 tael or so. The US variety market still shows a flat and tired situation. Manufacturers' appetites are still refreshing. Huaxin Tang Factory bought 300 bales, offering a price of 28 taels and 5 qian.</p>

<p>▲ Bombay: The market situation last week was quite optimistic due to the smooth political situation. After US cotton fell by half a point, the local longs slightly liquidated. Although the textile situation was damaged, the market still rebounded mostly. However, due to good harvests and strong competition from low-grade US cotton, the hope of reviving Indian cotton demand is extremely uncertain. As far as cotton receipts are concerned, although there is concern about insufficient rainfall, it is still considered smooth. Europe continued to have transactions, the Far East was calm, and Japanese merchants sold. The statistics for the past week are attached below (unit: thousand bales).</p>
<p>1931 1932</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1st 33 138</p>
<p>Weekend inventory 536 671</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1st 87 90</p>
<p>Shipped to Europe 21 19</p>
<p>Shipped to China 28</p>
<p>Shipped to Japan 32 70</p>
<p>Other regions 6 1</p>
<p>▲ Liverpool: There were inquiries for spot goods last week. In terms of futures, the market was quite firm in the first half of the week due to the resolution of the Lancashire strike, the poor weather for US cotton, and the textile activity on the mainland. However, it was tired due to the softening of US cotton and the selling of retail investors. Finally, it rebounded strongly due to the force on the other side of the Atlantic. Egyptian cotton did not fall with US cotton because of the government report on the 3rd that there was a reduction in cotton fields.</p>

<p>▲ Each gang's source in Hunan, Shanghai, yesterday was more than 30, and the Mu Street sales floor was busier than before. Chen Po's old rice in Zhongguan fell by 2 jiao. Kiln-grown Bai Ge melon ripe rice was stored thickly, and sales were weak and tired. Foreign Du pointed rice was sold as soon as it arrived. The opening price was set. ▲ Yesterday, there were not many arrivals from various routes at the New Gate, and the urban-rural trade was not very active. The opening prices of various goods had limited ups and downs. Changxi Bei rice and Liyang, Suzhou, and Jiangyin rice fell by 2 jiao in the morning market. In the afternoon, the situation became tighter due to a letter from Wuxi. Foreign Du pointed rice and wild rice stem ginseng pointed rice, the four types, were slightly entertained by foreign merchants, and the market was short and small by 5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Foreign Rice is Slightly Sold in This Street <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The market rises slightly by 1 or 2 jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice showed a slight improvement. The appetite in this street turned better, and northern gangs also made inquiries in the market, hoping for a good market. However, the foreign rice market was inevitably slightly integrated due to the consistent weakness of He Xia Du Geng, Du Jian, and various customer Xian rice. The market was traded slightly from this street. Saigon, a little over 500 bags each, was traded little by little. There was not much Saigon left, only slightly close to the market. The opening price was 8 yuan, 2 jiao, 2 fen to 8 yuan for Xiao Jiao, and 9 yuan, 3 jiao, 2 fen to 2 jiao for Saigon No. 1 rice. There were no other transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Autumn Harvest is Abundant, Rice Prices are Loose and Cheap, and Standard Flour Automatically Moves Downward <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a downward trend again. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat had rebounded by several points, the overall trend was extremely bad. Because foreign wheat is being purchased gradually, the US side will probably ship the current wheat to China. Moreover, the rice prices are loose and cheap. The autumn harvest is reported to be abundant everywhere. It is difficult to hold back people's hearts. Therefore, although the major factories did not put out large batches in the morning and afternoon, only small factories dumped about 100,000 batches. The rest was returned by longs, and the number was also not small. Observing the subsequent steps, if the major factories continue to put out, or if foreign wheat remains sluggish, it will still be difficult to look high on the market. As a result, the current month fell by 1 fen and 7 li and a half compared to the previous day, November fell by 2 fen and 12 fen, December fell by 2 fen and 2 li and a half, January fell by 2 fen, February fell by 2 fen and 2 li and a half, and March fell by 2 fen and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Wheat Prices Plunge During Peak Season <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market, prices for all months showed a sharp decline. This was due to the gradual weakening of domestic grain prices as a result of abundant harvests and strong reserves. Furthermore, rumors circulated that American wheat loans to China would soon materialize, inevitably dealing a heavy blow to domestic wheat prospects, causing widespread pessimism. The number of sellers gradually increased, as the influx of foreign wheat would naturally lead to the elimination of domestic wheat. As a result, the current month's price fell by four cents compared to the previous week, with November to January falling by six cents each, February falling by eight cents, and March falling by six cents. Spot wheat has already shown signs of weakening. Opening prices were: Yao wheat at 3.52 taels per picul, Yangzhou wheat at 3.37 taels per picul, with a total of 1,300 bags handled by Fuxin and Fufeng companies, it is said.</p>

<p>Since the recovery of dried lily flower prices, the continuous arrival of goods has gradually led to the accumulation of stockpiles, causing market prices to weaken. Sales from all sides have also been sluggish. It is estimated that the stockpiles of various firms in the market amount to more than 5,000 bags. Consequently, prices have slightly decreased by about twenty or thirty cents. Yesterday, the opening price at the market was 14.22 to 14.23 taels, with 50 to 60 bags traded. Top-grade dried lily flowers from Zhuang were sold for 15.5 taels, followed by 15 taels to 14.5 taels. Inferior quality old stock was priced at 7 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Down by Two and a Half Cents <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a decline in benchmark prices, and the settlement rate for Dutch currency was slightly longer. The publicly listed prices of the guildhall already showed a flat and weak trend. No. 24 raw sugar initially opened at 14.95 taels, but later saw some transactions at 14.925 taels, slightly lower by two and a half cents compared to the previous day. High-grade sugar was at 15.05 taels. No. 20 medium white sugar was at 14.25 taels, down by five cents. No. 18 medium white sugar was unchanged at 14 taels. No. 8 Dutch brown sugar was at 10.07 taels, No. 9 Dutch brown sugar was at 10.09 taels, and No. 10 Dutch brown sugar was at 11.1 taels. Other factory and trading house prices saw little trading, as the market trend generally showed a tendency towards weakness.</p>

<p>Yesterday, trading of tea by foreign firms remained sluggish. The sales of high-grade Zhen Mei tea were almost completely stagnant. Throughout the city, only Fortune Trading Company and the Russian firm Xie Ruili had sporadic demand for mid-grade Zhen Mei and Gongxi green tea. Market prices fell by another four or five taels compared to the previous day. Red tea from Qining and other areas remained unsold, and the tea market trend showed a significant slump, it is said.</p>

<p>▲35 packages to Hangzhou, 15 packages to Wuxing.</p>
<p>Silk merchants in Hangzhou and Huzhou have recently started weaving winter silk fabrics, but the quality of local silk is poor, so they are all using white factory raw silk. The nine-month forward silk contracts that various manufacturers committed to supply were all delivered by the end of last month. The silk merchants are now shipping them back to their factories in batches to meet production needs. Yesterday, a total of 50 packages of white factory raw silk were shipped out on the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train, of which 35 packages were destined for Hangzhou, and the remaining 15 packages were being transferred to Wuxing, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for woolen fabrics showed much greater progress compared to the previous month. Sales prices have been rising consistently, and sellers are generally optimistic. Han Ling Pong suiting fabric is particularly outstanding, being the latest popular material for autumn clothing. Tailors from the Hakka community and foreign tailoring businesses are eagerly seeking it. The market atmosphere is very active. Walun goods are selling for 5.575 yuan per chi. Yichangtai is offering 70-80 yards. Sample clippings from the Hongkou community are priced at over 20 yuan per chi, while the actual price is around 10 yuan per chi, it is said.</p>

<p>Recently, sales of British steel plates have been brisk, and factory demand has been strong, resulting in market supply failing to meet demand. Standard specifications have been rising steadily due to environmental factors. Current market prices are, for example, 0.25-inch plates can be valued at 8.25 taels per picul, 0.5-inch plates at 5.3 taels, 0.7-inch plates at 5.1 taels, and 0.125-inch plates at 4.75 taels, all rising by two to three cents compared to previous market prices. However, considering the recent surge in overseas pricing and the strong domestic demand, the market prospects are expected to remain positive. It is estimated that the total volume opened in the market yesterday was 700 to 800 piculs, which were handled by dealers from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai. Factory sales also amounted to over a hundred piculs, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Reactions from China and Abroad After the Publication of the Lytton Report <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Lytton Commission's report, which has attracted global attention, has been published. Public opinion in various countries has also emerged to assess its value. Yesterday, our reporter interviewed leaders from various circles in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign, to gather their opinions on the League of Nations report. Some thoughtful individuals believe that the report's wording is lengthy and its meaning is quite difficult to grasp, requiring time and careful study to express concrete opinions. Others who do not engage in empty talk emphasize that the Chinese people should strive for self-improvement and actively recover lost territory, believing that the report does not contribute to practical solutions. Wu Chaoshu even stated that the only effective weapon for resolving the Sino-Japanese problem is economic severance. People at the Japanese consulate still believe that the puppet state of Manchukuo cannot be abolished. The following is a summary of opinions from various parties:</p>
<p>▲Wu Chaoshu's Observations</p>
<p>Dr. Wu Chaoshu, a member of the Central Committee, told visitors yesterday that after reading Chapter 7 of the report, he learned that the investigation team was dissatisfied with China's economic severance with Japan. According to Wu's observations, there are two main reasons for this. Based on his numerous experiences attending the League of Nations, he deeply knows that the International Federation has a habit of not daring to offend powerful countries. The Lytton Report stated in the section on the bombing of the South Manchuria Railway that bombing the railway "is not enough to justify the Japanese military action," and also stated that "the Japanese military action that night cannot be regarded as a legitimate defense." It also confirmed that "Manchukuo" was created by Japan. All these delivered major blows to Japan, so it had to use its dissatisfaction with the economic severance as a way to make the powerful and unreasonable Japan feel a little comfortable. This is the first reason. Economic severance, from an international standpoint, can almost be said to have been invented by China. It is also used more in China, but in terms of labor and capital, the act of economic severance was first created by Ireland. The origin of "boycott" is actually an Irish person's name in the past. This person was a large landlord who had a dispute with workers, so the workers devised a way to resist him. Therefore, it has become the commonly used meaning of "resistance" today. When applied internationally, it has become a new weapon invented by China, and European and American countries are quite afraid of it. Therefore, the international community plans to impose sanctions on it. This is the second reason. Wu continued to say that if China now does not even have the weapon of economic severance, then China will definitely not be able to compete in the world. He firmly believes that to solve the Sino-Japanese problem, it is necessary to use diplomatic means to take advantage of the League of Nations and the international situation, as well as military resistance and other methods, but the only effective weapon is economic severance, and this is especially sufficient to show the unity of the Chinese nation. Wu also said that there is no country that has lost its territory that cannot recover it. For example, after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871, France lost the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine to Germany. After more than forty years, France finally recovered its territory in 1919. Poland has been destroyed for hundreds of years, and now it can completely restore its independence and autonomy. The Northeast issue only depends on the extent of the efforts of the people. Wu finally discussed Japan's strength, saying that Japan's military position can be called strong in the Far East, but its navy and army are still inferior to those of the major European and American powers. Although it is difficult for military forces to penetrate deep into the Far East, the economic side is a major weakness of Japan. The English proverb "Heel of Achilles" comes from the classical idiom of ancient Greece. Achilles was a person who, after being born, his father and mother hoped that he would become an immortal. Before long, a god told him that those who could follow him in practice would be able to achieve their wishes. Then the so-called god took his foot and immersed it in the river. All the parts of his body that were wetted by the river water became bronze and iron, and swords could not penetrate it. However, it was not known that the ankles held by the hands were not immersed in water and were still fleshy, and there was this weakness. As a result, Japan's weakness is like this. China's greatest strength is in the economy. To maintain this strength, we must be united and persist to the end, and not rely solely on foreign assistance to be effective.</p>
<p>▲Opinions from the British</p>
<p>A reporter visited Mr. , the chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce. He only took a brief look at the report but felt that the report was very fair. It has two values. First, the various disputes that had previously been based on conflicting claims can now be clarified with this report. Second, China and Japan can obtain a basis for negotiations from this. If China accepts this report and Japan rejects it, China's position in the international community will be more consolidated. The British government and fair people around the world must support this report.</p>
<p>▲Commentary from the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury commented on the report (above omitted). In short, the investigative team’s report cannot be regarded as the conclusion of the Manchurian issue, and that was not its original intention. However, it does provide a summary of the Manchurian incident in a competent and impartial manner, including the organization of the new state, and proposes a feasible solution. There is nothing seriously new proposed. The real problem remains unanswered. This statement is very simple, but the meaning is extremely complex. The question is whether Japan will insist on isolating itself from the world in order to pursue the expansion of its military and political power in the Asian continent without being bound by any other world resolutions. Will people tell Japan what price it is willing to pay up to now that it is willing to pay? Is Japan willing to endanger the German colonies in the Pacific that it manages? This is one of the main parts of the question that it should answer. We</p>
<p>have heard that Japan would rather fight the world than give up Manchuria. This matter is not under discussion for the time being. There is no question of war over Manchuria now. The question today is only whether Japan believes that what it believes is the Manchuria it has obtained and controls is worth the cost of losing its position in the international community.</p>
<p>▲Attitude from the Japanese Side</p>
<p>People at the Japanese consulate stated that they have not yet officially released any opinions on the Lytton Report, but they said that the State of Manchuria has already been produced and cannot be allowed to die prematurely. The only thing to do today is to implement the principle of Europeans ruling Europe, Americans ruling America, and Asians ruling Asia and start all over again. The time for negotiations between China and Japan on the Manchuria issue has passed. Future negotiations will not discuss the Manchuria issue. If China recognizes the current state of affairs and proceeds to negotiate the future relations between China and Japan, Japan will of course do its best.</p>

<p>▲Attending Tomorrow's Central Political Conference</p>
<p>▲Donald Accompanied Him Back to Peiping to Report</p>
<p>▲Zhang Xueliang to Go South to Meet Chiang</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, acting President of the Executive Yuan, along with Zhang Xueliang's advisor Donald and Huang Chundao, secretary of the Ministry of Finance, departed from his private residence on Qiqi Road at 3:00 PM yesterday, heading to the Hongqiao Airport.</p>
<p>He boarded a private Sikorsky aircraft bound for Beijing. According to Song before his departure, the League of Nations Investigation Team's report was rushed and he had not yet studied it in detail, so he could not comment on it. He is flying to Beijing today (i.e., yesterday) and will attend the Central Political Conference tomorrow (i.e., today) to discuss it in detail with the ministers of various Yuan so that they can deal with it. He will stay in Beijing for three or four days and then return to Shanghai temporarily and will not go to Peiping. The news reports that Zhang Xueliang was poisoned is completely unfounded. It is said that after Zhang Xueliang's advisor Donald arrives in Beijing, he will transfer to Peiping to report. According to reliable sources, Zhang Xueliang will go south to Nanjing after Donald reports back, and go to Lushan with Song Ziwen to meet Chiang Kai-shek, the military committee chairman, to discuss important issues in North China.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Wang Jingwei Suffering from Liver Swelling <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>▲Has Telegraphed the Central Executive Committee to Request an Extension of His Leave</p>
<p>▲Chu Minyi Returned to Shanghai with a German Doctor Yesterday</p>
<p>Chu Minyi recently accompanied the German doctor, Dr. Nolbo, by land aircraft from China Aviation to Hangzhou and then to Mogan Mountain to visit Wang Jingwei's illness. Yesterday at 11:50 am, Chu and the German doctor returned to Shanghai by the original plane. Chu immediately went to Qiqi Road at 2:00 pm to visit Song Ziwen to report on Wang's condition, and returned to Beijing by overnight train last night. According to Chu, Wang is suffering from liver swelling and needs to stay in bed for treatment. He has telegraphed Beijing to request an extension of his leave. The following are the recent symptoms of Wang and the original text of the telegram requesting an extension of his leave.</p>
<p>▲Wang's Symptoms</p>
<p>Chu told reporters yesterday: "After we arrived at Mogan Mountain, the German doctor and Mr. Wang conducted a detailed examination three times. According to him, the liver swelling has been slightly reduced, but it is not easy to massage due to excessive gas in the abdomen. Last time, the liver dropped to three fingers' width below the ribs, but now it is only three fingers, which is the result of a week of bed rest. The yellow color of the eyeballs has also faded slightly, and there are still yellow marks on the face. The pulse is slightly slower. Usually it beats eighty times per minute, but now it is sixty-six times. This can also prove that bile enters the blood. The entry of bile into the blood may be due to the liver swelling and the bile ducts being compressed, so this time we took a blood sample and a stool sample back to Shanghai for detailed examination. It is estimated that the blood sample last time contained 0.197% sugar, and the stool sample also contained sugar and bile. The doctor instructed that he still needs to stay in bed in addition to three meals a day, because walking around easily causes the liver to drop. Even when staying in bed, he must lower his pillow and raise the feet of the bed. The diet should avoid foods containing sugar and starch, and now also avoid fat. Therefore, the patient does not find much food palatable. It is estimated that he has lost seven pounds in weight in a week. In terms of treatment, in addition to taking medicine, he also applies a medicinal paste and a hot water bottle to the liver. The doctor said that if the patient can follow this treatment and rest quietly for three weeks, the inflammation of the liver and gallbladder may gradually subside, otherwise he may get chronic hepatitis, and in addition to diabetes, he will have a liver disease.</p>
<p>▲Telegram to the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>Wang telegraphed the Central Executive Committee on the 2nd to request an extension of his leave, saying: "The Central Executive Committee and the Central Political Conference of the Nanjing government: I am deeply grateful that the Central Committee previously approved my leave of absence for two weeks for recuperation. Now the sugar disease has been slightly reduced, but suddenly liver swelling has been added, and I cannot get out of bed. I have no choice but to ask for an extension of my leave until I recover, when I will return to Beijing to serve. Please take a look. Wang Zhaoming, Winter"</p>
<p>▲Telegram to Chiang Kai-shek</p>
<p>Also telegraphed to Chiang Kai-shek, military committee chairman: "Lushan, Chairman Chiang: I have received your letter. My sugar disease has been reduced, but suddenly liver swelling has been added, and the pain is more severe. The doctor ordered me to stay in bed and first remove the pillow and put the feet of the bed up high, and use medicine inside and outside. In this situation, I cannot but ask the Central Committee for an extension of my leave. I am anxiously concerned and very grateful. Wang Zhaoming, Winter"</p>

<p>▲Reply to the Anti-War Association Telegram</p>
<p>The Anti-Internal War League General Assembly previously telegraphed Liu Wenhui and Liu Xiang separately due to military mobilizations between Chengdu and Chongqing in Sichuan Province, requesting an explanation to reassure the people. After first receiving a reply from Liu Wenhui, the association received a reply from Liu Xiang yesterday via the Sichuan Post-War Supervision Office in Beijing. The reply stated: "To the Anti-Internal War League General Assembly: I have read your telegram and your words are earnest and sincere. I deeply admire your patriotism. At this time of national crisis, the brothers in Sichuan are thinking of sharpening their swords and preparing their horses to act as a backing for the government's diplomacy. How can they kill each other and lightly start a war? The military mobilization between Chengdu and Chongqing that your telegram inquired about is completely false. It is precisely what is called 'idle talk, which may not satisfy the heart,' and the intention is to provoke discord and cannot be known. A special reply is made for your reference. Liu Xiang, Respectfully"</p>

<p>▲Eastern Sun Vows to March Eastward</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan sent three telegrams to Shanghai yesterday to report on the fighting situation in the Manzhouli and Hailar areas. They are recorded separately as follows: (1) (Above omitted) Mijiang received an emotional telegram from Su Bingwen in Hailar, saying that the armed forces of the puppet state's border police in Manzhouli and Hailar have been disarmed at the same time today. Japanese expatriates and diplomats are under protection and surveillance. Internal troubles have been eliminated and the local area is peaceful. He will lead the army east within days to recover the city. I also received a telegram from Yan, the liaison officer of the team (29th), saying that the Japanese in Manzhouli and Hailar have cleared away the corrupt Japanese troops and the people's morale is extremely high. It has been deployed and it is scheduled to march on the Eastern Sun. The operation is progressing smoothly. A telegram will be sent within days to promote the loyalty and righteousness of Cuizhangxiangge who are completely sacrificing themselves for the country. Please spread the news widely so that compatriots across the country will respond and assist in order to encourage morale. I pray and so on. Specially conveyed by Lan, Koutongqiaoyin. (2) (Above omitted) According to a report from a commissioner in the front, the puppet state's troops stationed in Manzhouli and Zhalantun have matured and have already declared their attitude on the 28th, resisting the puppet state and capturing and killing the military police and violent Japanese who are willing to please Japan. The local merchants and people are all overjoyed and tore up the puppet flags and Japanese flags and re-erected the national flag. The Japanese have lost the ability to resist. The Japanese authorities intend to request Russian troops to cross the border for protection. A person from Shenyang reported that after 10 p.m. on the 26th, the volunteer army attacked Shenyang again. They captured more than 100 Japanese soldiers at Dadong and Dabeiguan, killed three Japanese officers, and seized two Japanese aircraft and a large number of guns and ammunition. Later, because a large team of Japanese reinforcements arrived, they withdrew and so on. Special telegram sent to be reported to the various parties. Thirty-printed Lan. (3) (Above omitted) According to a special report from Jinxi, on the morning of September 17, two Japanese aircraft flew to Gaoqiao to scout our volunteer army and distributed leaflets to intimidate the farmers. Because the two aircraft were very close to the local area, most of the local farmers united to shoot at them. Unexpectedly, one aircraft was hit and crashed, and the fuselage was completely destroyed. Two pilots were killed at the time. The other aircraft flew obliquely to Zhen Dong more than ten miles away and also landed. The pilot escaped. Our farmers were afraid that the Japanese army would follow, so they buried the wreckage with soil to eliminate traces and ambushed four miles outside the town. As expected, a large number of Japanese troops, about 40 in number, arrived from Jinxi, intending to vent their anger and arbitrarily massacre, so there was a major conflict with the farmers. As a result, all the Japanese troops were surrounded and none survived. Later, the village was bombed by a large number of Japanese aircraft, but our farmers had already moved elsewhere. This special telegram is sent to inform the various parties to disclose it in moderation. Thirtieth-printed Lan.</p>

<p>Feng Guanxiong, commander-in-chief of the Northeast Mongolia Border National Salvation Army, and Liu Shouhang, deputy commander, are both feeling困乏 because of ammunition and supply issues. They have sent a letter to the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association in the city, requesting relief. The letter states, "Since the September 18th Incident, it has been more than a year. The violent Japanese have been gaining ground, taking Longsha in the north and Jinzhou in the west. Their behavior is brutal and known to the world. They have turned to invade our Songhu and disturb Tianjin. Fortunately, the loyal and brave soldiers in the country have resisted with all their strength and have not been able to show their fierceness for a long time. However, their ambitions have not yet been realized, and they are still pouring all their strength into Rehe. They have disregarded public reason and justice. Guanxiong and others are pained that foreign troubles are becoming more urgent and national affairs are becoming more difficult. Our province has fallen into the hands of the enemy, and our compatriots have been brutally killed. Disasters and man-made disasters have brought the nation to the brink of collapse. Therefore, we have raised the banner of justice to eliminate the violent Japanese and fulfill the national duty of saving the country. We are prepared to die and lead tens of thousands of soldiers to fight the Wokou to the death. We have fought bravely and persistently for a year, fighting more than a hundred battles, winning every battle and constantly winning, killing countless Japanese bandits and seizing many weapons. At present, our army is strong. Now that the Japanese bandits are singing high and trying to eliminate the volunteer army, it is time to kill the enemy and survive. The battle history of our army over the years has long been known to compatriots across the country. However, there is a shortage of ammunition and no contact, so the land that has been obtained has been lost again. All those with blood and energy are heartbroken and are trying to seek support. Recently, our army's ammunition, cold clothes, medicines, and other supplies have become difficult to raise and are now in trouble again, so there is no way to find a solution. Therefore, we have prepared a letter to appeal to the patriotic compatriots in our rear for considerable assistance to benefit the killing of the enemy. We are deeply aware that all of you at the association are wise, understand righteousness, and are loyal to the country. You are truly admired by our soldiers and others. We hope that you can understand the difficulties of the times and save tens of thousands of blood-soaked soldiers from the sea of suffering. If there is assistance, it will not be difficult to wipe out the great shame and humiliation and drive away the evil Wokou in one fell swoop. We sincerely believe that you Shanghai leaders will provide the rear support for the resistance against Japan and share the enemy's hatred. We sincerely hope that you will provide as much assistance as possible. As long as the enemy's weapons are sharp and precise, victory will ultimately belong to us. We respectfully request you to send it to the Headquarters Office at No. 39 Juxiantang, Jiebaozijie, Xidan Pailou, Peiping. Thank you for handling this and replying to our request. This matter is related to saving the country and is a true test of public friendship.</p>

<p>All overseas Chinese in Borneo, Java, and other parts of the South Seas were extremely saddened and angry after the September 18th Incident. At that time, they raised money to recover lost territory and resist Japan. The total amount of donations was approximately 200,000. They were temporarily deposited in the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in each area. When the January 28th Incident in Shanghai occurred, the overseas Chinese there donated half of the money to the 19th Route Army. It is reported that the remaining half has now been decided to be transferred to comfort the Northeast Volunteer Army, and representatives Zhu Zufan, He Zhongren, and others have been appointed to go to the Northeast to comfort them. It is reported that Zhu and others have already started their journey to Shanghai and will briefly stay before transferring to Guanwai. For the sake of prudence, it has been decided that the funds will be distributed by Zhu, a member of the Central Committee and leader of the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra to Broadcast by Radio <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's orchestra broadcast once via the X.C.B.L. radio station at the beginning of this year. The results were very good, but since the broadcast location required a specially built hall, it was not continued after that. Now the Music Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council sees that more and more families are installing radios, and plans to hold broadcasts again this winter, once a week. This will be done automatically by the Bureau and will be handled by a certain radio station, but it will not be related to its advertising sequence. Since the radio station provides convenience and does not charge a fee, the Bureau will charge the broadcasting company that hires the orchestra according to the example of hiring the entire team or a part of it for a reduction of two tenths, and it will also allow it to calculate each time for at least half an hour (usually at least one hour), but it should not affect long-term performances elsewhere. It is planned to start this broadcast this winter and hold it every Thursday afternoon from 9:00 to 10:15. The Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council has already approved this plan. From now on, the performance of the orchestra will be more popular among the general audience.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Regarding Discussions on Commercial Lawsuits <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter visited an employee of the Commercial Press regarding the case of dismissed employees suing the company's board of directors in court, demanding retirement pensions and severance bonuses. The following is a record of the conversation:</p>
<p>(1) Retirement Pension: It is said that the company indeed had a compensation regulation before the January 28th Incident. Employees who were dismissed would be given a certain amount of retirement pay, the amount depending on the length of their service and the amount of their salary. However, this regulation only applied to normal times and could not be applied after extraordinary changes. Furthermore, the rights to interpret and amend it belonged to the company's board of directors. The compensation was paid from the company's surplus, with the annual allocation and accumulated amount over the years serving as a compensation fund to cover all expenses under the aforementioned regulations. However, the regulations stated that this fund still belonged to the company. In May of this year, the company received approval from the Social Affairs Bureau to allocate the remaining fund entirely to the dismissed employees as a final relief measure. The company made great efforts to comply, and the fund has now been exhausted.</p>
<p>(2) Severance Pay: In addition to the retirement pension under the aforementioned compensation regulations, the company has no other agreement to provide severance pay to employees. The precedent cited by the plaintiffs, the China Eastern Manufacturing Factory, was that when China Eastern closed down, the company's business was thriving. Out of sympathy for some of the dismissed employees, they were given some extra salary, but this was a special donation and could not be used as a precedent, let alone applied to the deeply painful situation today. Moreover, after the China Eastern incident, the company dismissed many employees, but there was never a case of extra salary being given like in the China Eastern case, which can serve as clear proof. As for this time, when the company dismissed employees, each person was given about two months' salary, but this was all done voluntarily by the company and there is no reason to use it as a basis for litigation.</p>
<p>(3) Bonuses: The company's financial settlement for the previous year was extended to the end of January this year because when the war broke out, it was during the company's inventory time, and all goods and books were completely destroyed. Even if the company had a surplus, it had completely turned into a loss by the time of settlement. Moreover, the company's regulations stipulate that bonuses can only be distributed to employees when shareholders have dividends. Now that a large part of the company's assets has been destroyed and shareholders' equity has been reduced by two-fifths, there are no bonuses to speak of.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter asked whether the company had ten million yuan of war risk insurance in Hong Kong. The person smiled and replied that if the company had war risk insurance, how could the shareholders have suffered a reduction in equity? Anyone with a little knowledge can tell that this is undeniable and there is no need to argue.</p>

<p>▲ The City Government Will Add Roads</p>
<p>The issue of relocating the Shanghai North Railway Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has been discussed by the Railway Bureau and the Ministry of Railways on multiple occasions, and a general consensus has been reached. According to Secretary Zhang Tingrong of the city government, the city government will also make its best efforts to raise more than one million yuan in public bonds specifically for building roads from the station to other important areas. The original area along the railway will also have additional roads built from north to south, making transportation between the concession, Zhabei, and Jiangwan more convenient.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Women's Relief Association was suspended due to the war, and its internal and external work could not be carried out. Recently, the organizers of the association have been actively reorganizing in order to resume operations and plan to carry out large-scale women's relief projects. The association also stated that many members in various districts have been scattered after the Shanghai war, and their addresses cannot be found. Therefore, they will first convene a discussion meeting with all members in the coming days to inquire about the addresses of the members, and then proceed with the reorganization.</p>

<p>The Jiejiang Steamer, which travels between Shanghai and Qingdao, was docked at the China Merchants Bureau's wharf in Pudong the day before. Three workers, Sun Zhongxing and coppersmith Li Liangming, were working in the furnace room when a fire from the engine furnace spread outside, causing a fire in the cabin. Sun and Li were both suffocated by the smoke and burned by the fire. The people on the ship immediately tried to extinguish the fire and dragged Sun and Li out to rescue them, but they had both been burned beyond recognition and died a long time ago. The incident was immediately reported to the water patrol police, who sent detective Ge Changsheng to take the bodies to the South Wharf Life Saving Bureau. They reported to the local court, which commissioned prosecutor Yang and others to come to the scene to examine the bodies. The families were instructed to collect the bodies for burial after verification.</p>

<p>▲ Zhang Yuping, a Pitiable Case</p>
<p>Zhang Yuping, from Gaoyou, Jiangbei, is twenty-five years old this year and has not yet married. He is currently working as a water boiler at the Xingfa Garden teahouse, opened by his elder brother Zhang Yuqi, at 298 Rue Lartigue in the French Concession, earning a meager monthly salary. Recently, he has taken a liking to a woman from his hometown surnamed Mou. Both parties agreed, and Zhang wanted to marry her, but he had no funds. He asked his brother for help, but it was difficult to fulfill his wish. As a result, he became mentally disturbed and, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at around 5:00 PM, he had a sudden moment of despair and hanged himself from the bed with hemp rope. At 6:30 PM, Han Xiaoyuanzi, an apprentice from a pancake stall, caught a glimpse of him and shouted. His companions rushed to rescue him, but it was too late to revive him, and he died immediately. His brother reported the incident to the Foch Police Station, which sent detectives to bring the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for examination. Yesterday, they reported to the Second Special Court, and Prosecutor Deng Baosun came to the hall to examine the body. According to the complaint from the deceased's brother and witnesses, the official ruled that Zhang Yuping committed suicide by hanging himself and authorized his brother Zhang Yuqi to collect the body for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Flour Sacks Filled with Gunpowder <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>▲ Taken from Artillery Shells</p>
<p>▲ Both Defendants Fined 100 Yuan Each</p>
<p>Around 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese detective Shen Yuzhou from the Yangshupu Police Station discovered that two men from Hubei, Yang Huaxing and Yang Shunxing, were carrying two sacks of flour at the Tengyue Road Wharf. They hired a sampan, planning to go to the Changjiang Steamer, acting flustered and suspicious. The detective stepped forward to question them, but they gave evasive answers. Upon opening the sacks, they were found to be filled with about seventy pounds of gunpowder. They were taken to the police station and, yesterday morning, escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Fu Lin presided over the criminal court. The police station's lawyer presented the case, stating that the two defendants claimed in the police station that the gunpowder was purchased from a scrap metal shop in Nanshi in August of this year and that they intended to take it back to their hometown in Hubei for use by the local security team. However, they could not provide a passport upon request, which was clearly a false statement. The gunpowder was different from ordinary gunpowder. The police station's investigation revealed that it was taken from artillery shells. In previous similar cases involving the disposal of such explosive materials, the materials were confiscated and stored in the stolen goods warehouse, which was considered dangerous. It was requested that the materials be handed over to the police station for destruction. When questioned, the defendants admitted that they were taking it back to their hometown for use by the defense regiment. After verifying the confession, Judge Fu sentenced the defendants to a fine of one hundred yuan each for the crime of possessing explosive materials. If they were unable to pay the fine, it would be commuted to one day of imprisonment for every three yuan. The gunpowder was handed over to the police station for disposal.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Apprentice at Money Exchange Runs Off with Three Thousand Yuan <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>▲ Eloping with a Prostitute to Fulfill Their Dreams</p>
<p>▲ The Stolen Money Found Under the Pillow</p>
<p>▲ Only Five Dollars Spent</p>
<p>▲ Sentenced to Three Months in Prison, Sentence Suspended</p>
<p>Zhang Mengzhou, a native of Ningbo, is seventeen years old and has been working as an apprentice at the Hongsheng Money Exchange at 230 Sichuan Road for two years. He is usually very careful and conscientious in his work, so he is highly trusted by manager Xu Chengzhi. On the morning of the first of this month, at 10:15 AM, Xu Chengzhi ordered Zhang and the other two apprentices, Qi Weiran and Luo Xueyong, to go to the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank at No. 7 The Bund to withdraw 18,000 yuan. Luo hid 11,000 yuan, Qi hid 4,000 yuan, and Zhang carried 3,000 yuan. On the way back to the exchange, when they reached the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, Zhang suddenly disappeared. After searching everywhere without success, Xu Chengzhi reported the incident to the General Police Station and requested an investigation. Later, the exchange received a phone call from a Mr. Xia, who stated that Zhang had left a leather suitcase at his place and that someone was coming to pick it up. Xia suspected something was amiss, so he called to ask if Zhang had sent the person. After the exchange confirmed Xia's address, they ordered detective Jiang Shangpei to go to Mr. Xia's residence at No. 35 Beishan Road to retrieve Zhang's suitcase. The police found a photo of a woman in the suitcase. Detective Jiang conducted a detailed investigation and learned that the woman, named Wang Lanhua, was from Yixing, seventeen years old, and worked as a prostitute at No. 8 Lane, Rue Amiral Bayle in the French Concession. She had been in a relationship with Zhang for three months and had become intimate. The detective secretly went to the brothel at 11:00 PM the night before and found Zhang inside, fast asleep with Wang. He woke them up and found the original banknotes, 2,995 yuan, hidden under the pillow, only five yuan short, which he had already spent. He immediately took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court's Criminal Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated the case and requested that he be prosecuted for embezzlement in the course of business under Article 357 of the Criminal Law. Xu Chengzhi then explained the circumstances of sending them to withdraw the money and stated that the defendant's conduct had always been quite good and that this was his first offense, so he did not want to pursue the matter further and requested a suspended sentence. When questioned, the defendant admitted that he had committed the crime due to temporary confusion and requested leniency. Qian Hongye, the head of the Criminal Court, verified the confession and announced the verdict in court: Zhang Mengzhou was sentenced to six months in prison for the crime of embezzling objects held in the course of business, with a three-year suspended sentence. The stolen money was returned to the plaintiff.</p>

<p>▲ Discovered by Her Husband for Her Immoral Behavior</p>
<p>▲ Deeply Regretful, She Had a Thought of World-Weariness</p>
<p>Duan Yi, a woman from Hubei, was twenty-three years old. Her husband, Duan Henghe, was a barber. Recently, he discovered that she was having an affair with a man surnamed Wang, so he slightly reproached his wife. The day before yesterday, the woman was deeply regretful and had a sudden thought of world-weariness. Therefore, at around 2:00 PM, she went to the workshop of her niece, Duan Chen, at No. 2 Fufeng Flour Factory on Moganshan Road, and used the kitchen knife she was carrying to stab her throat several times. She bled profusely and fell unconscious. Her niece caught a glimpse of her and screamed frantically. The police heard the sound and arrived immediately. They took the woman to Guangren Hospital for treatment, but she died soon after due to her injuries. They then took Duan Chen and others to the Putuo Road Police Station and sent detectives to investigate. They also found the deceased's husband and brought him back to the police station. Her body was taken to the morgue on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Local Court, which commissioned Prosecutor Zhan Liangce to come to the morgue to examine the body. According to Duan Chen, the deceased was her aunt. The day before yesterday, she came to her place when she was sick and lying in bed. She saw her take out a kitchen knife from her waistband and cut her throat. She was unable to rescue her, so she screamed frantically. People arrived but it was too late to save her. The police questioned her husband, Duan Henghe, and Zhan Jun ruled that the deceased Duan Yi had indeed slit her throat with a sharp object before her death. The body was handed over to her husband Duan Henghe to collect for burial. The husband Duan Henghe, the niece Duan Chen, the aunt Gao Sanpo, and the sister-in-law Duan Liu were detained for investigation and sent to the court for review.</p>

<p>▲ Annoyed for Failing to Borrow Money from His Mistress</p>
<p>On the evening of the 1st of this month, a local named Li Quansheng went to the beancurd shop opened by his friend Lu Gensheng at 406 Route Tenant de la Tour to look for his mistress, Shao Wu, and ask for money. Frustrated by not getting it, he suddenly had a thought of world-weariness and secretly went to the shop's drying terrace, where he hanged himself from the railing with his belt. The next morning, Fei Amao, a neighbor in the shop, caught a glimpse of him and immediately notified Lu Gensheng and others, who untied him, but he had already died of asphyxiation. They reported the incident to the Huizi Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate and took the body to the morgue on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, they reported to the First Special District Local Court, which commissioned Inspector Zhan Liangce to come to the morgue to examine the body. According to Fei Amao, who is twenty-four years old, he went to the drying terrace at 6:00 AM that morning and caught a glimpse of the deceased hanging from the drying terrace next door. He immediately notified and helped untie him. Lu Gensheng stated that he rented a three-story beancurd shop. Shao Wu was a friend of his wife and often came to his place to chat. On that day, Wu came first, and Li Quansheng came later to ask her for money. When she refused, Li left the room. He did not know that he had hanged himself on the drying terrace. Shao Wu stated that she was thirty-nine years old, a local resident living in Huaxingfang, and had no adulterous relationship with the deceased. She only knew him because he was a tailor who made her clothes, so she recognized him. However, he often borrowed money from her, and she gave him some relief because she saw that he was poor. He borrowed money from her again that day, and she replied that she could lend him a few dollars tomorrow. She saw him leave the room and then went to bed at Lu's place, not knowing that he had suddenly hanged himself. After verifying the confessions, Zhan Jun ruled that the deceased Li Quansheng had indeed committed suicide by hanging himself. There was no family of the deceased, so the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>

<p>The Songji Customs Brokerage in Qipan Street, Public Concession, had previously shipped four large boxes of wool balls worth more than 2,000 yuan to Hankou for a customer. When these goods were piled up at the Dazhong Wharf at No. 16, ready to be loaded onto the Xinning steamer, two boxes suddenly disappeared. They immediately searched everywhere and found one box at the wharf, but the other box was nowhere to be found. They immediately notified all the wool shops to detain anyone who came to peddle these wool balls. Until the day before yesterday, two people suddenly brought twenty-four boxes of these wool balls to the Yongrun Wool Shop at Dadongmen to peddle. The shop feigned interest and immediately notified Songji Customs Brokerage. Wu Faxiang from the brokerage arrived and apprehended the two men, along with the stolen goods, and took them to the first district for preliminary interrogation. One man, named Qu Baogen, twenty-three years old, a local resident, and the other, named Wang Luyi, twenty years old, from Anhui, claimed that they were entrusted by Shen Fusheng, a native of Shaoxing who lived at No. 14 Yiqing Lane, Yiqing Street, Fangbang Road, Ximen, to peddle the wool balls.

<p>▲ Wu Qiaofu and Others Evaded Arrest</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Public Works Bureau previously received a report from Wang Zhenbang, the former chief of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and Xu Yuanfang, the director of the Wharf Warehouse Management Office, stating that vagrants and thieves were harming travelers on the wharves along the Pujiang River in the city. Therefore, they jointly formulated seven measures to organize the wharves and requested that they be reviewed, reported to the municipal government for approval, and then instructed the two bureaus to comply. The Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately informed the First District and the First District's First Branch to implement the measures as soon as possible to ensure the safety of travelers. Yesterday, District Chief Guan of the First District and Branch Chief Yi of the First District's First Branch, after receiving the order, believed that the fundamental way to eliminate thieves on the wharves was to strictly investigate the small goods shops that bought stolen goods, according to the third of the measures, to prevent theft. Therefore, they dispatched a large number of police officers to break up a number of large-scale small goods shops in Wangjia Wharf, Zhuhang Wharf, Guanqiao Xuejia浜, and other places under their jurisdiction. However, the shop owners Wu Qiaofu, Xiao Defu, Hong Lazhu, and Hou Mou were all well-known hooligans who were well-informed and had evaded arrest. The district and branch chiefs have notified all their subordinate officers to pay attention to apprehending them.</p>

<p>Wen Zongyao and other like-minded people have initiated the China Film Company. From the beginning of its establishment, the aim is to be a fully Chinese-owned company registered in China. It has now been approved by the Bureau of Social Affairs and has begun preparations for raising capital. The initiators are all well-known figures of the time. The summary of the share prospectus states that the capital is two million yuan, the total annual business income is two million five hundred and ten thousand yuan, and the expenses for raw materials, wages, operating expenses, and shareholder official interest total nine hundred and twenty-five thousand yuan, leaving a surplus of five hundred and eighty-five thousand yuan. The most meaningful aspect of the expenditure is the fifty thousand yuan for the Film Training Institute and the thirty thousand yuan for the Screenwriting Committee. This is because it is recognized that the Chinese film industry must be fundamentally improved, and actors must be highly educated and rigorously trained to be effective. Screenwriting cannot be completed by one or two people, so a committee is established to manage it. This demonstrates a commitment to promoting the film industry and raising the art of film beyond mere profit-making, which is admirable. Now that the share offering has begun, and preparations are underway, and those gentlemen have both integrity and a focus on fundamental businesses, its development can be anticipated, and the enthusiasm for subscribing to shares is certainly expected.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor:</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I was shocked to read the article in your newspaper on the 3rd of this month in the "Local News" column about the water outage at Laotianxiang Lane. Upon investigation, the demolition dispute at Laotianxiang Lane was due to Mr. Yu Hualong inviting me in a private capacity to mediate. Later, because the tenants' proposed conditions were difficult for the landlord to accept, the private mediation was unsuccessful. Since I am not the landlord, please reconcile with the lawyer representing the tenants. There was no agreement to sign a contract on October 1st, and the landlord certainly did not suddenly break the contract. All the details reported are inconsistent with the truth. I am responding to request that you promptly investigate and correct this. Sincerely, Xu Yannian, Chief Editor of Shen Bao.</p>

<p>▲ New Homicide in Nanjing</p>
<p>▲ Attention to Those Who Enjoy Holding Crabs and Devouring Them</p>
<p>As the autumn wind blows fiercely, fat crabs appear on the market, perfect for enjoying with wine. The joy of holding a crab and devouring it is an endless pleasure that people recognize in this world. We only know that crabs and persimmons are mutually antagonistic and should not be eaten together. Who knows that eating crabs with pomegranates can also lead to death? Here is a record of a strange homicide case from Xiaguan, Nanjing, where someone ate pomegranates and crabs together. A villager came to the city to buy goods for his son's upcoming wedding. He attended a banquet at a friend's house in Xiaguan. The friend knew that he was fond of drinking and that fresh crabs were on the market, so he cooked crabs to accompany the wine. The villager was very enthusiastic, devouring and drinking heartily until he was completely drunk. After getting drunk, he felt a burning sensation and was unbearably thirsty, so he bought several pomegranates and ate them all ravenously. A moment later, he suddenly had severe abdominal pain and felt extremely ill, repeatedly shouting "I'm uncomfortable!" and "Help!" After about one or two hours, he suddenly died. According to the doctor, the villager suffered from crab poisoning. Eating pomegranates and crabs together is dangerously lethal, but he died ignorantly, which is truly tragic. Those who love to eat crabs should be aware of this warning.</p>

<p>▲ Ministry Certificate, Imperial Edict, and Receipt Tickets</p>
<p>▲ Submit All Within Six Months</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau issued an announcement yesterday stating that the bureau is organizing land and issuing land practice certificates as the only proof of ownership of real estate. Each certificate is accompanied by a topographic map, detailing the location of the household land, the four boundaries, and the length dimensions of the owner's area. All old field deeds, division deeds, agency deeds, imperial edicts, and other documents will be taken back and invalidated, and land certificates will be issued in exchange. As the project is nearing completion, announcements have been made in stages for the exchange of certificates. It has been found that the Ministry Certificates that have been assessed for grain and the County Certificates and Imperial Edicts issued by the county that are not recorded in the old printed records are generally inconsistent. Moreover, there are no property acres, or it is not known where the land is located. In order to organize this land and protect the property rights of owners, the Bureau specifically issues this announcement urging all owners to promptly submit the Ministry Certificates or County Certificates Imperial Edicts that have been assessed for grain and the receipt tickets for grain paid over the years within six months from the date of this announcement, so that the Bureau can verify the measurement and exchange them for land practice certificates to manage the property. This matter concerns property rights, so please do not delay or harm yourselves. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Rice Milling Industry Association Resolves to Restrict Mortgage Methods <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>At yesterday's executive committee meeting of the Shanghai Rice Milling Industry Association, Chairman Zhang Nianju reported the purpose of the meeting, which was that the mortgaged amount of cargo transported to Shanghai exceeded the price of the goods. The milling agents were unable to repay the mortgaged amount, harming the industry. A remedy should be discussed. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the Anhui and Ningbo rice transported to Shanghai were mortgaged to various banks and money shops in Xiaguan by the transport companies acting as agents. The mortgaged amount often exceeded the price of the goods. If the market price fell, the shippers would often avoid coming to Shanghai due to losses, which had frequently harmed the industry over the years. It was decided to use 200 pounds of coarse indica rice as the standard for the current market price, and the mortgage amount, including freight, should not exceed five yuan. If the packaged amount is large, the same principle will be applied. Future market price increases or decreases will be reported to the industry at any time. If any excessive mortgage is approved privately, the milling will be punished by public discussion once it is verified. A letter will be sent to the financial institutions in Xiaguan that specialize in mortgages and the Transportation Association, requesting that they inform the transportation companies to pay attention to the handling. An announcement will be published to inform the cargo shippers. The meeting was adjourned after discussing other cases.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Tianzhang Paper Mill Labor Dispute Resolved <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>▲ General Wage Increase of Five Cents Per Person</p>
<p>▲ Implemented from the Sixteenth of This Month</p>
<p>The New Sound Society reported that the workers of the Tianzhang Paper Mill demanded improved treatment, which led to a strike. Although the government advised them to resume work first, the wage dispute was mediated by Party and government agencies. It has now been two months. At 2:00 PM yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened the Labor-Capital Mediation Committee for a final mediation. Labor representatives Wu Gensheng and Yang Guanhua, and capital representatives Liu Yuanshi and Di Zhaolin, attended. The chairman, mediator Zhu Guilin, first reported the mediation process, followed by separate statements from the labor and capital sides. After a long period of discussion, the two sides finally agreed and signed the minutes as follows: The dispute between the parties is over wages. The committee convened a mediation, and now the agreement signed by both parties is specially recorded as follows: (1) All workers directly paid wages by the factory will receive a general wage increase of five cents per day. However, workers whose wages have been automatically increased by the factory by more than five cents this year and newly hired workers this year are exempt from the increase. (2) The date of the above wage increase will be implemented from October 16th of this year. This matter has been signed and mediated with the consent of representatives of both parties, and should be regarded as a labor agreement between the parties in dispute.</p>

Appointment letters will be sent out immediately and work will begin. The association also sent a letter to the Northeastern People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association yesterday, stating that they had received a letter from the association's representative, Mr. Gehang, on September 28th. The letter stated that there were representatives in Beiping from Shenyang and Liaodong. The association had decided to allocate 10,000 yuan, which should be remitted to Beiping to reward the various units attacking Shenyang. Five thousand yuan had already been remitted to the Bank of China in Shanghai on September 24th, and it was assumed that it had arrived. The remaining five thousand yuan had also been decided to be used to reward the troops attacking Shenyang and would be remitted by the Bank of China. According to a letter from representative Sheng Yu, the unit was the most effective in attacking Shenyang, and the association was requested to allocate half of the funds to the unit to encourage them in case of emergency. A total of 10,000 yuan has been remitted in succession. It is requested that formal receipts be issued separately and sent to the association for filing. This is to be notified to the Northeastern People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Opium Found on Beijing-Shanghai Train <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲ Garrison Command Requests the Railway Bureau to Hand Over People</p>
<p>The Songhu Garrison Command's Detective Team received a tip-off the day before yesterday stating that someone was secretly transporting a large number of contraband items, etc., and entrusted the Beijing-Shanghai train driver to secretly transport them to Shanghai. Therefore, the team immediately dispatched detectives Zheng Shanfu, Wang Kaiming, and Wang Shaohua to rush to the North Station to wait at 11:00 PM that night. Not long after, the fourth express train from Beijing to Shanghai arrived at the North Station at 11:30 PM. The detectives rushed onto the train (locomotive) to search for about two hours. As a result, sixteen pounds of opium and more than 350,000 copper coins were found in the coal pile. The driver, Deng, and two stokers escaped during the interval. It is reported that the Garrison Command has reported the situation to the Railway Bureau and requested that the three people, including the driver and stokers, be handed over for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Bureau of Social Affairs, etc., Re-investigates War Zone Damage Statistics <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>▲ Urges War Zone Residents to Register Damage as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>After the Shanghai War, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Accountants Association jointly sent personnel to investigate the approximate amount of damage in the war zone. They first published a rough estimate of the damage in April and May of this year. Afterwards, in order to achieve precision, they began to re-examine the original statistics and asked war zone residents to register their damage. According to news from the three agencies yesterday, this statistic is now nearing completion and is currently being reviewed. It is divided into several items, including the death and missing population in the war zone, the burning and destruction of houses, the loss of movable property, and the destruction of public utilities. It is expected to be finalized within this month. However, because the investigation of the three agencies is entirely based on the reports of war zone victims, and there are many victims who have not reported, reaching nearly half, this report cannot be said to be completely complete.</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Four Criminals Apprehended in the Settlement <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>▲ Identified by Wu Guangzong's Family</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that Wu Guangzong, director of the Hydrographic Office of the Naval Department, was shot dead by thugs at his private residence in Ningkang Lane, Anlan Road, Ximen, on the morning of September 21st. The Municipal Government of Shanghai immediately ordered the Municipal Police Department to instruct Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team, and Jin Tian, the district chief of the second district, to solve the case within three days, strictly apprehend the criminals, and bring them to justice. Details were reported in a previous publication.</p>
<p>It is now known that the case has been solved by Lu Ying, the captain of the municipal detective team. The bandits were hiding in the Dahua Hotel on Fuzhou Road and the Juelu Hotel on Xizang Road. Personnel were immediately dispatched to request the Zhabei Police Department to send additional Chinese and foreign officers to arrest four suspects at the addresses last night. Four pistols and thirty-four bullets were seized, and the words "Shanghai Municipal Police Department" were engraved on the magazines and barrels. All were immediately detained at the police station. The detectives, together with Chinese officers from the relevant police district, drove to Wu's residence in Ningkang Lane and summoned Shen Taihua, the bodyguard, Chen Yongkuan, the male servant, and Qiu Ren, the female servant, to the police station for identification. Four random prisoners of mixed ethnicity were deliberately placed among the four arrested suspects. After Xu Taihua and others separately identified the group, three of the suspects were identified as the ones who held guns and assassinated Wu at his home. The police department then transferred them to the Special First Court for preliminary interrogation before returning them to custody.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM the following morning, Lu Ying, the captain of the Municipal Police Department's detective team, personally led Gu Liancheng, the team leader, and six other detectives to the police station to request the police chief to temporarily transfer the suspects to the detective team for questioning. The police chief agreed to bring them over, but stated that they would be returned to the police station for detention at 4:00 PM that afternoon.</p>
<p>During the interrogation, the four suspects confessed as follows:</p>
<p>One identified himself as Song Jiande, from Henan, 30 years old. He came to Shanghai from his hometown on September 2nd and met a colleague, Mr. Jia, who is currently a detective in the Second Regiment of the Huzhou Security Office. Mr. Jia invited him to stay at the Dahua Hotel on Fuzhou Road and told him to go to the Chinese district at 7:00 AM on the 21st to handle some business.</p>
<p>Another identified himself as Zhang Shaoliang, from Henan, 23 years old, residing on the third floor of the Dahua Hotel. He came to Shanghai from Henan on September 16th to look for his old superior, Zhu Jieren's adjutant, but was unsuccessful. He had dinner at a certain restaurant and ran into some fellow villagers who asked him why he had come to Shanghai. He replied that he was looking for a friend and had not found him. They invited him to work in Huzhou on a case and immediately sent him to the Dahua Hotel. At 7:00 AM on September 21st, they asked him what kind of gun he could use, and then gave him a six-inch Browning pistol. He and Song Jiande and two others each held pistols and went to a certain lane of unknown location. They told him to guard the back door while they went inside, went upstairs, and fired shots. They then fled back to the hotel together.</p>
<p>Another, Wu Jize, from Henan, 24 years old, residing in Hongxing, Huzhou. On August 9th, he met a fellow villager, Mr. Jia, a detective in the Second Regiment of the Huzhou Security Office, in front of the Dahua Hotel. Mr. Jia called him inside and asked him to help handle the case, claiming it was an official matter. He stayed for two days. On the morning of September 21st, he was given a pistol and told to go to the Chinese district to handle the case. It was true that the detective knocked on the door and went inside to assassinate Wu.</p>
<p>The suspect Yao Jiechen confessed that he was from Huzhou, 38 years old, a farmer living in a certain village near Hongxing Bridge in Changxing. He came to Shanghai a day ago to find work for his son and stayed at Chen Xuejiang's home in Jixiang Lane, Zhoushan Road. Because the house was being demolished and rebuilt, he was planning to return home when he heard that Li Lianyuan, the detective chief of the Second Regiment of the Huzhou Security Office, had been arrested for an incident. He went to the Dahua Hotel to inquire and met an absconding suspect, Mr. Jia, who borrowed more than twenty yuan from him to pay for the room fee, promising to return it in two or three days. So he went to collect the debt that day and was detained.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Fire Insurance Representatives from Disaster Area Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>▲ Also Seeking Compensation from Sincere Company</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fire Insurance Compensation Coordination Committee for the disaster area held an emergency meeting the day before yesterday and decided to petition the insurance companies yesterday for compensation. Prior to this, they had consulted with the Third District Party Headquarters to use the Tianhou Palace Bridge as a gathering place and notified all policyholders to gather there. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, approximately 500 people arrived on time. Around 9:00 AM, they formed a procession and first went to Sincere Company to demand compensation, led by the chief commander, Wang Zhixiang. Wang Zhixiang, Hu Yibo, Situ Ji, Ma Juegen, and others were selected to negotiate with the company. The others waited on the side of the road. Liang Guohua, the manager of the company, met with the representatives. Liang said that he would be responsible for compensation within the scope, but excessive demands were difficult to accept. The Public Works Department considered that the gathering was disrupting traffic and ordered the police to disperse the crowd. Around 12:00 noon, the policyholders returned to Tianhou Palace, but Shuji Elementary School in Tianhou Palace notified the Fifth District Police Station to resolve the disturbance caused by the large crowd. The Fifth District Police Station immediately dispatched a patrol officer and eight policemen to Tianhou Palace to persuade the crowd to disperse. The residents elected Wang Zhixiang, Liang Guohua, and eight other representatives to petition the Municipal Government. Approximately thirty residents volunteered to follow. They arrived at the Municipal Government around 3:00 PM. The representatives submitted their cards requesting to see the mayor, while those who followed waited quietly outside the gate for a reply. Mayor Wu sent Director Yuan Shenglu to meet with them. Yuan expressed his views on the various requests made by the representatives, stating that the Municipal Government sympathized with the suffering of the disaster-stricken citizens and hoped to find good solutions for relief. However, all solutions could not deviate from the law or ignore the facts. Therefore, the Municipal Government was unwilling to make empty promises that would be difficult to implement. He would convey the opinions of the representatives to the mayor to carefully consider a solution that balanced both law and fact. As for designating a location for gatherings, it was best to contact the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The Municipal Government would provide legal protection. The representatives were immediately satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Further Demands for Compensation Today: The association stated that yesterday's contact with the company yielded no results, and the Municipal Government was also unable to provide concrete solutions. However, the disaster-stricken households were in dire straits and would take effective measures. Without sacrifice, there would be no success. Tomorrow (today) they would continue to expand publicity and demonstrations.</p>

<h3 id="e179">Record of the Fourth Day of the Chinese Medical Association Conference <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Medical Association continued its conference yesterday. At 9:00 AM, a business meeting was held. The first topic discussed was the journal issue. The members present believed that original papers should be fully published because the association's journal had a wide circulation not only in China but also had a large number of foreign subscribers. If it could be improved with greater effort and rigorous review, it would certainly attract the attention of the international medical community. It was regrettable that the cost of reprints of articles in the journal was too high and should be reduced to increase circulation. The meeting then discussed the association's charter. After revisions by Dr. Liu Ruiheng and Dr. Jin Baoshan, with input from Dr. Song Wusheng, Dr. Zhu Hengbi, Dr. Chen Wanli, and Dr. Yan Fuqing, it was agreed that the charter should be simple and the detailed rules should be detailed. The general assembly then voted to have the executive committee revise the association's charter without submitting it to the general assembly again for approval.</p>
<p>After the business meeting, a general meeting of the Department of Internal Medicine was held. The program included Pumay's "Problems of Lung Disease in China," Chang Sun's "Neurological Diseases Discovered in Yunnan," Zhu Shenzhi's "Application of Douzhi Feeding for Infants," Kantaber's "Epidemic Meningitis," and Luo Aisi's "Skin Diseases." More than 200 people attended.</p>
<p>After lunch, group meetings were held in the departments of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Public Health, Pathology, and Physiology. At 3:00 PM, the General Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society specially provided multiple cars to take the members to visit the new site of the National Shanghai Medical College. The college is located to the left of the General Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Haig Road. The new building consists of two four-story buildings. The first building houses the library, offices, and student dormitories, and the second building houses the classrooms and research rooms of the pre-medical and basic science departments. After the visit, they went to the hospital to visit the clinical departments, outpatient clinics, and wards. After a tour, at 4:00 PM, President Yan and other staff members hosted tea and refreshments on the lawn. Another group was taken by the Public Works Department in cars from the Lister Institute to visit the department's slaughterhouse. At 7:00 PM, the members went to the Zhimeilou Restaurant on Fuzhou Road for a banquet hosted by the Shanghai Branch. Toasts were exchanged, and guests and hosts enjoyed themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Ends Cholera Prevention Work <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>▲ A Total of 786,407 Injections Administered</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has always made great efforts to prevent cholera during the summer and autumn seasons each year. Since 1927, the harm caused by cholera in Shanghai has been greatly reduced. This year, due to the aftermath of the war and the discovery of patients with true cholera in late April, the bureau took the prevention work more seriously than in previous years, implementing disinfection and free vaccination, and promoting knowledge of epidemic prevention. Free vaccinations have been carried out since May 1st. Now that the weather is cooling in autumn and no cholera cases have been found, the prevention work was officially ended at the end of September. A total of 786,407 injections were administered this year, an increase of more than 200,000 injections compared to last year. Therefore, although the cholera outbreak this year was fierce, it did not become a major disaster due to the early implementation of various preventive measures.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Collision Between Qing Tian Warship and Jiang Yu Steamer <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>▲ Passengers and crew on the steamer unharmed</p>
<p>▲ One soldier injured on the warship</p>
<p>Recently, shipping accidents have occurred one after another. First, the Tonghua ran aground, then the Hua Wu was trapped in the fog and ran aground on the riverbank. Then the Xinfeng and Chao Wu collided, and the Zhoushan touched a reef in Yantai. Before one wave subsides, another rises. Now there is another collision between the China Merchants Bureau's Jiang Yu and the Hydrographic Office's Qing Tian warship. Yesterday afternoon, the Jiang Yu arrived in Shanghai. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Jiang Yu's Passage: The China Merchants Bureau's Jiang Yu steamer came to Shanghai from Hankou. At noon on October 1st, the ship arrived at Jiangyin. According to regulations, it stopped in front of the Jiangjing anchorage across the river to load and unload goods and passengers. At 10:23 PM that night, after the loading and unloading of goods and passengers was completed, the ship weighed anchor and set sail for Shanghai. It initially sailed at slow speed. At 10:30 PM, a dark shape was spotted on the starboard side of the ship. It was a ship without lights anchored on the river, obstructing the Jiang Yu's navigation. The captain, considering that it was difficult to identify the ship at night, ordered the helm to turn to the left to avoid the ship and ensure safe passage.</p>
<p>▲Two Ships Collide: When the Jiang Yu discovered a ship anchored on its starboard side, it quickly reversed course to the left. However, at that time, the tide was receding rapidly, and the bow of the Jiang Yu could not avoid the collision. The Jiang Yu's captain quickly stopped the ship and inspected it. He then realized that the ship at anchor was the Hydrographic Office's Qing Tian survey warship. But why did it not have stern lights on, leading to this collision? The Jiang Yu stopped, turned around, and sounded its whistle. It then lowered its anchor to rendezvous with the Qing Tian warship and jointly inspect the damage.</p>
<p>▲Extent of Damage: After the collision between the two ships, Jiang Yu's captain, Liu Hongce, visited Qing Tian and met with captain Chen Changqing. Together, they inspected and found that the steel plate on the left side of the bow of the Jiang Yu steamer, about ten feet wide and seven feet high, was damaged, and the iron plate on the bow anchor seat was also broken, and the iron chain was also broken. Fortunately, the breach was above the waterline, so the bow compartment was spared from flooding. The damage to the Qing Tian warship was the anchor hole in the bow was broken and the flagpole in the fore cabin was bent and broken. After both parties clarified the matter, they signed a joint certification.</p>
<p>▲Returning to Shanghai for Repairs: The Jiang Yu ship had no injuries to customers, but the Qing Tian warship had one petty officer, Chen Luyan, injured in the waist by the anchor chain during the collision and sent to the hospital for treatment. The Jiang Yu steamer did not set sail until 1:00 AM on the 2nd of the morning and arrived at Wusong yesterday morning at 10:35 and parked at the Jinliyuan wharf to unload cargo. In the afternoon, the captain reported to the bureau. The shipping department sent personnel to the ship to inspect and then repair the damage so that it could resume sailing.</p>
<p>▲The captain reported that after arriving in Shanghai, the captain reported the collision as it was. His ship, the sixth, arrived at Jiangyin on October 1st to stop loading and unloading cargo and passengers. The vessel started to navigate slowly at 10:23 PM and stopped after 26 minutes for a transfer from the left bank's vessel for transport. Unexpectedly, on the starboard side suddenly appeared a dark object like a sampan obstructing the navigation line. The vessel also did not have corresponding anchor lights lit. It was difficult to discern in the darkness what kind of vessel it was. The vessel could only steer to the right side as much as possible and was unable to reverse due to the extremely rapid ebb tide. The sharp maneuver led to the left bow of the vessel colliding with the other ship. Upon stopping to inspect, it was learned that it was the Qing Tian survey vessel. The issue of responsibility is still undecided.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Record of Hua Wu Steamer's Arrival in Shanghai After the Accident <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The Nanhua Shipping Company's Hua Wu steamer ran aground near Zhenjiang, as reported previously. After several attempts, it was difficult to move the ship. The captain was left with no choice but to come to Shanghai to discuss rescue measures. He hired the most powerful tugboat from Wheelock Marden and set off for rescue the day before yesterday. However, the ship's hull was completely submerged, making the situation more dangerous than when the China Merchants Bureau's Tonghua ran aground at Huangshiqiu. In the former case, the ship was lightly loaded and small. In the latter, it was heavily loaded and large. The drag was long, but it was impossible to move the ship. Captain Yang Honglin, who had served as a pilot for many years and was experienced in water flow and sand lines, realized the danger. He devised a plan to move the ship's bow anchors and throw them into the river using iron barges, so that the ship's bow used the anchor's pulling force and the ship's stern used the tugboat's pulling force. The engines were simultaneously operated at full power, which successfully freed the ship. It was already aground for four days. Fortunately, the cargo loss was not severe. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, and it is reported that the hull was not damaged.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Continued News on the Towing and Rescue of the Zhoushan Steamer <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>▲Unloading Cargo and Transporting to Weihaiwei: The Taikoo Company's Zhoushan steamer ran aground on a reef outside an island off the coast of Yantai. Because the bow compartment was flooded and trapped in the rocks, it was impossible to free the ship immediately. Therefore, Taikoo's Yantai branch dispatched a tugboat to the scene of the accident to unload a portion of the cargo from the Zhoushan steamer and transport it to the Weihaiwei wharf for storage in warehouses to reduce the weight of the Zhoushan steamer and make it easier to tow. Unloading is currently underway.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Ship Heading to Tow: A Japanese salvage company in Dalian has dispatched a tugboat to Yantai to prepare for the salvage operation. It is reported that the salvage plan is to use two large barges to support the Zhoushan steamer on the left and right, since only the bow compartment is flooded. This would raise it to the surface of the water, then repair the breaches, drain the accumulated water, and then tow it. This would be easier to accomplish. The British naval vessels HMS Kent and HMS Medway are still anchored alongside the Zhoushan to provide assistance.</p>
<p>▲Passengers Sent to Shanghai: All passengers on the Zhoushan ship have been rescued, including five Westerners and ninety-four Chinese, totaling ninety-nine people. After being rescued by a British naval launch to Yantai, the company has dispatched the Shuntian steamer from Tianjin to Yantai to transport these ninety-nine passengers to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai office received a telegram stating that the Shuntian steamer carrying the passengers is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 PM tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Taxpayers' Association Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>▲ Discussion on Water and Telephone Fees</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Concession held its second executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. Those present included Zhang Yi, Wang Xiaolai, Pei Yunqing, Cheng Xiechun, Guo Shun, Dong Zhenlong, Xu Jiqing, Shen Tianxin, Yu Zhihao, Hu Fengxiang, Chen Jicheng, Xu Yongzuo, and Chu Seng Hua. Liu Hongsheng, Yuan Lvdeng, Bei Songsun, and others were also in attendance. Wang Xiaolai presided, Tao Leqin took minutes, and the meeting proceeded according to protocol. First, the chairman reported on the resolutions of the previous meeting, followed by a report on the association's affairs. Then, the following items were discussed: (A) Discussion on the English-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company's water fee calculation by meter, where the amount has increased sharply, affecting the livelihoods of ordinary citizens and small households. It was resolved to form an investigation committee to investigate the cost of water in the French Concession and Zhabei, as well as the installation methods of meters, the fee collection methods, and the reasons for the sharp increase in water fees. The candidates for the committee will be decided by the standing committee. (B) Discussion on the Shanghai Telephone Company's increase in usage fees and the retroactive collection of past fees. It was resolved that the price increase for telephone service and the retroactive collection of fees are absolutely unacceptable. (C) Discussion on the Shanghai Accountants Association's proposal that, as Chinese taxpayers within the concession contribute a large portion, Chinese professionals should participate in the review of the Shanghai Municipal Council's income and expenditure accounts. It was resolved that Mr. Hua should first make contact. (1) Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's method of waiving taxes north of the Suzhou Creek, there were no major disputes because of prior mutual consultation before the announcement. South of the Suzhou Creek, several companies sent letters requesting special consideration. The response was that the so-called special circumstances must be similar to the bombing of the Wing On Cotton Mill, and the matter was then resolved. (2) After the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax waiver measures north of the Suzhou Creek were announced, the association immediately sent a letter to the council stating that telephone and water fees should follow the same example. The council replied that it had discussed with the telephone and water companies and would handle them separately. However, many letters have been received requesting the association to negotiate due to the varying periods of free service. (3) A certain factory suspended operations, and a trade association sent a letter requesting the association to negotiate with the Shanghai Municipal Council for a tax waiver. The response was that the suspension of operations cannot be used as a reason for a tax waiver. (4) Disputes over the termination of lease agreements often occur when water is cut off. The response was that legal remedies should be sought. However, one clause in the Shanghai Municipal Council's contract states that if the property is still occupied, the water company must not cut off the water at the owner's request, and the owner is still responsible for the fees. It is unknown how the Shanghai Municipal Council interprets this. Attention should be paid to the fact that the contract provisions must be adhered to. (5) Regarding the matter of two Chinese members of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Land Committee, the consul general has consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government according to Article 28 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations and sought their consent on the method of selection. The Shanghai Municipal Government sent a letter to the association seeking its opinion for reference. The standing committee will invite committee members to discuss in detail and make a decision based on the principle of not violating the aforementioned regulations, and adopt a solemn approach. (6) Regarding the issue of telephone price increases, after receiving the news, the association immediately sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council explaining that the market was depressed after the Japanese disturbances in Shanghai, and there was no reason to increase prices. The council replied that the directors had taken note. Since then, the price increase has been implemented, starting in July of this year, with residential lines increasing from 52 taels of silver to 65 taels, and business lines from 78 taels to 105 taels. Each call increased from 5 cents in small silver coins to 4 cents in silver, and must be retroactive to March 27 of this year. Public opinion was in an uproar, with widespread opposition, especially to the retroactive nature, which was considered a violation of the legal principle of non-retroactivity. The Shanghai Evening Post attacked the increase vigorously, and the Shanghai Special District Telephone Users Association was also organized in response. The association repeatedly communicated the users' opinions to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the director general replied that all documents were published in the gazette and there was no need to repeat them. However, regarding the retroactive nature, although the reasons were sufficient, citing contractual provisions, it was still unsatisfactory. Regarding the price increase after July, it would have been feasible without the Japanese disturbances in Shanghai. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council's telephone contract stipulated that automatic exchanges would also be installed in the outer road areas within two years. The Shanghai Municipal Government's obstruction allowed the company to be exempted from fulfilling its obligations. In fact, after the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities declared that the telephone company was responsible for the failure to install automatic exchanges, the basis for exempting the telephone company from fulfilling its contractual obligations was considered far-fetched. Even if the obstruction of automatic exchange installation was sufficient to exempt the telephone company from fulfilling its obligations, the users' inability to pay the increased price due to the Japanese disturbances was indeed an irresistible force. The Shanghai Municipal Council, as the executive body representing the taxpayers, insisted on enforcing contractual obligations, which was legally unpleasant, even though many paid under duress, and the issue remains unresolved. (7) The issue of water fee calculation by meter is significant. In the past, water fees were calculated based on rent, which had the effect of regulating wealth. To eliminate waste, meter calculation would prevent this effect from being lost, and it would be reasonable if all conditions were met. However, during a month when the atmosphere in Shanghai was extremely tense, the Shanghai Municipal Council signed a contract with the water company to adopt a meter system, and the basic price was not determined by a general meter installation cost experiment, but rather arbitrarily. As a result, the water fees calculated by meter were much higher than those calculated by rent, in some cases by as much as nine times, especially for poor small households. Water fees have traditionally been included in the rent paid by tenants, especially in poor small households, causing great panic among landlords. If they bear the cost themselves, they are unable to do so. According to Mr. Kui Yanfang, in one case, the rent was 100 yuan, but the water fee calculated by meter was 96 yuan. If added to the tenants' burden, it would increase the burden on the poor, contradicting Mr. Hill's opinion and fundamentally conflicting with the aforementioned principle of wealth regulation, making it extremely difficult to implement in practice. If this case is superficially viewed as only affecting landlords, it will eventually affect all users. If a reasonable and equitable solution is not urgently sought, the serious consequences are unimaginable. The crux of the matter is that the current director general, Mr. Jones, has too close a relationship with public utilities, resulting in a strong bias. Since entering the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Jones has specialized in public utility cases, and many public utility contracts are his work. According to experts, these contracts are very favorable to companies and not favorable to taxpayers. For example, the long term of the water contract and the difficulty of changing or revoking it, as well as the restrictions on amending the bus contract requiring five years' notice, are all self-inflicted by the Shanghai Municipal Council and cannot be improved. Now that Mr. Jones is the director general, it is humanly impossible for him to not be prejudiced. This is why his only response to the association's repeated letters is to reiterate his published views.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Silk Workers' Strike Escalates in Severity: Resumption of Strike in the Concession Area Yesterday <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>▲ Disturbances Occur, One Female Worker Injured</p>
<p>▲ Male Workers in Silk Factories Across the City Also Make Demands</p>
<p>▲ Shuang Gong Silk Factory Fully Resumes Work Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The labor-capital dispute at the single-reeling silk factories in this city has intensified. Yesterday afternoon, female workers in factories in the concession area resumed their strike, causing disturbances, with one person injured. The Yichang factory in Hongkou district is closing down. Female workers at the Shuang Gong factory resumed work yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Strike Resumes in the Concession Area: At 1 p.m. yesterday, female workers at the Xiangfeng Silk Factory on Gansu Road in the concession area suddenly went on strike. The situation became chaotic as all workers left the factory and gathered at the Jingwei Factory on Arbuthnot Road, demanding that they join the strike. The factory authorities, seeing the fierce momentum, were unable to dissuade them, and the working female workers were panicked and had no choice but to stop the machines and release the female workers. As a result, many female workers gathered at the Longyuan, Runchang, and Xuxiang factories on the same road. By around 2 p.m., all five factories, including Xiangfeng, had fully joined the strike. During the strike, the Huishan Police Station of the Public Concession received a report and dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to stop it, resulting in a conflict with the female workers. A female worker named A Mao from the Xiangfeng factory workshop was injured and fell to the ground. She was taken back to her home by the other female workers for treatment.</p>
<p>▲ Trade Union States Reasons: A reporter from New Voice News Agency interviewed the director of the Third District Silk Reeling Trade Union yesterday to discuss the reasons for the resumption of the strike: (1) It has been many days since they accepted the advice to resume work, but no effective solution has been seen. (2) The factories will be paying wages on the 5th and claim that they will still be paying 4.5 jiao, with no increase at all. (3) The factory authorities announced that the female workers in the district have no hope of increasing their wages and that it is the mischief of a few. The trade union planned to send personnel to persuade them, but because the personnel were accused of coercing the strike during the last strike, it was not convenient to send personnel this time to avoid being falsely accused. They only hope that the party and government organs will promptly and impartially handle the matter.</p>
<p>▲ Workers Also Make Demands: After the labor-capital dispute at the silk factories, the male workers at the silk factories that have started work across the city also gathered to request that the trade union propose: (1) Restore the silkworm chrysalis price to 4.5 jiao per yuan. (2) Restore the four working days per month. The Third and Fourth District Silk Reeling Trade Unions separately submitted requests to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday to mediate.</p>
<p>▲ Trade Union Petitions Yesterday: In view of the extension of the female workers' strike, each silk factory in Hongkou plans to close down. Yesterday, the Yichang Silk Factory closed down and issued the female workers their savings. The Fourth District Silk Reeling Trade Union sent staff member Lu Xusheng to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to request that they be stopped and to promptly find a way to mediate the labor-capital dispute at the silk factories. Director Wang Xianqing of the Mediation Section received them and promised to discuss the matter with the Party Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau. At 3 p.m., the Third District Silk Reeling Trade Union sent staff member He Yin to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau to report on the resumption of the strike by workers in the concession area, requesting impartial mediation, which was fully accepted.</p>
<p>▲ Shuang Gong Resumes Work Yesterday: After a misunderstanding between male and female workers at the Fulun Shuang Gong Silk Factory on Tianhe Road in Hongkou, the factory manager and the government provided detailed explanations and obtained the female workers' understanding. Work resumed at the factory yesterday morning. At the same time, the Fifth District, Third Sub-station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police to protect the factory, and by 6 a.m., all the workers had entered the factory to resume work in good order.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Soy Sauce Workers' Strike: Soy Sauce Industry Agrees to Fulfill Conditions <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>▲ Trade Union to Convene Group Leader Meeting Today</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, since the organization of the Committee for the Maintenance of Conditions by the employees of the soy sauce industry in this city, they have repeatedly negotiated with the employers' trade association regarding the old labor-capital contract, requesting its earnest fulfillment. The Soy Sauce Industry Trade Association, in addition to sending the labor's Maintenance Association survey form to each garden, is said to have recently convened an emergency meeting to seek a solution. However, in order to seek a speedy resolution, the labor side continued to recommend representatives Shao Guoyong and Ren Jieting yesterday to negotiate with the Soy Sauce Industry Trade Association. Wu Yinzhi, Zhu Yunsheng, Yan Yunhe, and others received them and expressed their willingness to take full responsibility to earnestly order each garden to fulfill the contract. Therefore, the result was quite satisfactory. However, since the soy sauce industry still has no statement, the labor side believes that they intend to sabotage the contract and will convene a meeting of group leaders across the city on the 4th (today) to devise a response.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Shanghai South Bus Workers' Strike: Mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau Yesterday Proves Ineffective <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>▲ Labor Refuses to Vacate Factory Premises</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the dispute over the suspension of business by the Shanghai South Bus Company was mediated by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, which convened both parties at 2 p.m. yesterday. Labor representatives Qian Shunlin, Hu Jinshan, and Qiao Jihe, employer representatives Xu Jiqin and Chen Gongcheng, and Municipal Party Headquarters representative Fan Guoren were present. Peng Zhenqiu of the Social Affairs Bureau presided and Wang Zhiqin took minutes. The chairman first explained that the case has yielded no results after two interrogations and that the employer failed to attend the third meeting. However, due to the workers' dire financial straits, they have repeatedly presented requests for mediation. Therefore, the bureau convened formal mediation, hoping that both labor and management would seek a resolution to the case in a more favorable manner. Employer representative Xu Jiqin then stated that the company had previously paid off the workers' back wages under the supervision of representatives from the party and government organs, and the workers had agreed to leave the factory. Now the labor side has violated the intentions of the party and government and, on the 28th of last month, still used the excuse to enter the factory and seize vehicles, which is hindering the accountant's liquidation work. The bureau should immediately notify them to withdraw and that the company believes that the case has come to an end in terms of the dispute and that there is no need for further mediation. Labor representative Qian Shunlin then stated that the workers' entry into the factory this time was not illegal because the accountant Jiang Wanping, entrusted by the company, stated when paying the back wages that the liquidation period would be about two weeks and that it would be reported to the party and government organs for review. Since the suspension of business, it has been over a month, and there is still no indication of when the accountant's liquidation will be completed. The workers are compelled by their financial situation and have no choice but to enter the factory, but they have not seized any vehicles and are not hindering the accountant's liquidation. They cannot accept the company's representative's request for the workers to withdraw from the company before the dispute is resolved. The dispute on the spot was very tense. The chairman then held individual talks, but the labor and management each held their own ground and the proposed solutions were not close. The employer representatives were instructed to consult with the shareholders and provide a definitive solution. A reply will be provided this morning. The labor representatives were also notified to submit a list of the wages of each worker for several months to the bureau for further handling.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Finance and Health Bureaus Requesting Postponement of Salted Pork Inspection <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent separate letters to the Finance and Health Bureaus, stating that on September 30, the Salted and Preserved Meat Trade Association sent a letter stating that (omitted)... This case has been opposed by the salted and preserved meat and ham industries since the bureau proposed it. Because the reasons were not listed, they were not conveyed. The current statement is that the salted pork is transported from other ports and repeatedly salted. Although the appearance is dirty, the quality is definitely not rotten. It has been sold in Shanghai for a long time, and those who like it have not had any adverse reactions. There is no need to inspect it. Since 1928, the city's commerce has been in a slump, and salted pork is no exception. Now that the goods and sales are both weak, it will be even more difficult to maintain business if inspection fees are added. This is the second reason why it should not be inspected. The situation is not without considerable reason. We are sending this letter to your bureau with the request that you review and temporarily postpone the implementation of this measure to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants.</p>

<p>121st Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held its 121st County Political Meeting at 10 a.m. yesterday. The heads of the finance, construction, and education bureaus, the director of the Treasury, the secretary of the County Government, and section chiefs attended. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu chaired the meeting and Hu Gongshou took minutes. The following cases were discussed and resolved: (1) The county magistrate submitted for discussion a report from the Finance Bureau stating that it had been ordered to allocate 300 yuan of silver from the local funds to repay Jiang Ren for the advance payment of the public expenses for borrowing boats to manage debt collection from debtors, and asked how the county should handle the matter. It was resolved that the local finances were extremely difficult, the annual budget had already been determined, and there were indeed no funds available to allocate. It was requested that the Finance Department approve the allocation from the collection of old debts and provincial taxes. (2) The county magistrate submitted for discussion a request from the County Construction Bureau for the First District Office to request a reduction in the ferry license fee and asked how the county should handle the matter. It was resolved that, at the beginning of operation, a fee of 1.5 yuan would be temporarily permitted to be collected.</p>

<p>Director Huang Naishu of the Postal Bureau has submitted his resignation to the Ministry of Transportation because the bureau's income has been greatly reduced since the Northeast postal service was blocked, making it impossible to maintain operations. The Ministry of Transportation believes that Huang has made outstanding achievements and has been deeply reliant on him, so he ordered him to be retained and sent Postal Director Lin Shi to Shanghai to personally comfort and retain him. It is now heard that Huang's intention to resign is still very firm and he has telegraphed the ministry to request his resignation. He intends to handle the handover as soon as it is approved.</p>

<p>Liang Zuoyou, a righteous man from Shandong, donated 30 million yuan to relieve the national crisis. The first telegram was sent, and I doubted its accuracy, because in our economically backward country, I had never heard of a Shandong businessman with assets exceeding 70 or 80 million. I suspected that the word "thousand" or "ten" was a mistake. Unexpectedly, subsequent telegrams confirmed it. Therefore, I have not given up on the inheritance system. The idea of rights is developing in our country, and Liang Zuoyou can donate generously. The fact that he is admirable is beyond words, and I don't need to repeat it.</p>
<p>According to Liang Zuoyou, the expenditure of the economic funds is divided into three categories: 20% to subsidize bandit suppression funds, 20% to relieve unemployed disaster victims, and 60% to revitalize industry. In terms of the quantity and nature of the expenditure, it meets the essential standards for alleviating the national crisis.</p>
<p>However, our country's economy has never been transparent. The people have no idea about the country's income, expenditure, and their uses. It is inevitable that funds will be used for different purposes than originally intended. As long as there is money, it will be used first, and then we'll talk about it. Our country's economy is in such a chaotic state and has become a habit. I don't know if the government can follow Liang Zuoyou's intention in spending the economic funds, or if it will make people doubt. Some say that Liang Zuoyou's donation should be used to set up a custody committee to oversee the use. However, this system is not applicable in our country. For example, the Palace Museum also has a custody committee, but the result is still that there are cases of stealing and selling palace artifacts. The establishment of a custody committee is meaningless.</p>
<p>Liang Zuoyou donated 30 million yuan, and his purpose of relief is such. But Liang Zuoyou has already donated, so the government will properly spend the economic funds. Liang Zuoyou is just doing what he feels is right, and there is no need to worry about the aftermath.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Talking About Several Kinds of Bottle Sealing Products Shen Min <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Whether it is Western medicine, chemical reagents, industrial chemicals, or cosmetics, flavors, etc., such as things that are volatile or absorbent. Although they have been stored in bottles, they have been sealed with glass stoppers or corks. But it's still not suitable. You must add a kind of solid sealing object. There are many kinds of these items. Use compatible items to seal according to their different natures and prices. For example, for things that are absorbent. Common items can be used for sealing. If it is a volatile or combustible substance. You have to be careful. Because ordinary solid sealants. Such as sealing wax, Faraffn, etc. have to be melted with fire. Carelessness can be dangerous. Although the sealing object is very small. But its use is also very wide. Now I will talk about them separately.</p>
<p>Ordinary Solid Sealants</p>
<p>These solid sealants are mostly used for absorbent items. Such as mineral salts. As well as cheap and non-combustible items, etc. Its main products. Such as sealing wax, is a rosin compound. Faraffn is a mineral wax extracted from kerosene, etc. It can be melted into a liquid with fire first. Then pour it on the bottle mouth. Everyone probably knows about these very common things. No need to say more.</p>
<p>Special Solid Sealants</p>
<p>This sealing object is used on bottle mouths that store volatile or combustible substances. Also expensive medicines. Or commercial products that need to look beautiful. This type of sealing object must also be used. There are many kinds of it. They all need to be manufactured. They are not naturally generated. So they need to be explained separately as follows. But limited by space. I can only cite two kinds.</p>
<p>(1) Guncotton Sealing Object Its raw material is Eollodion. The method of making Eollodion is to dissolve Tolubbpyroxylin in Etoet. It becomes a thick solution. The bottle mouth is coated with this liquid substance. It can solidify into a transparent thin layer in a few minutes. It adheres to the bottle mouth. If you want to be beautiful. You can use various pigments. Add it to the Eollodion liquid in advance. The bottle mouths of various cosmetic fragrances on the market. More expensive ones have this kind of solid sealing object wrapped around the bottle mouth. Its advantage is that it does not need to be melted with fire, so there is no danger of combustion.</p>
<p>(2) Glycerin Compound Sealing Object Glycerin is an oily substance. Is it also good to use for sealing objects? Isn't that strange? But chemistry is a matter of endless changes. Readers, please don't be impatient. Wait for the author to tell you the principle and method of making it. Add fine powder of Okiadeoflrad (commonly known as litharge) to thick glycerin. These two items, one dry and one wet. Mix them together. It can be turned into a very strong Eement. Because litharge is a substance with extremely high drying properties. So glycerin, although it is a non-drying substance. If you use too much litharge. It will also dry and solidify. Its use.

<h3 id="e197">On the Need for Improvement of Popular Reading Materials by Zeng Yu <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>In Chinese society, where education is so underdeveloped, the need for and improvement of popular reading materials is truly urgent. This is because the general population who have not received education naturally know very few characters. For their reading materials, it is essential that the meaning is simple and the characters clear. Although there is now a profusion of novels on the market, finding one suitable for the common people can be said to be rarer than hen's teeth. In the past, one often saw rickshaw pullers like Little Sanzi and apprentices at blacksmith shops like Afu, and vegetable sellers like Wang Si, reading books while cooling off in the streets and alleys. However, if you were to look at the titles of their books, they would invariably be something like "Meng Jiangnu," "Four Seasons Mountain Songs," or "Suzhou Scenery, Eighteen Touches," etc. These kinds of meaningless little books can almost be considered</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>their only reading material. Given this situation, their knowledge only gets worse. There are also those who know a little more characters and are keen on reading novels of the kind that are "China's Only Family Treasure for Thousands of Years"—supernatural and superstitious stories with flying swords, heroic knights-errant, immortals, and demons fighting each other (these kinds of books are still emerging endlessly in bookstores). This is even more harmful, and simple-minded people, poisoned by them, often daydream about becoming sword immortals (last year, a newspaper reported that an apprentice at a shop in Wuxi ran away, leaving a letter saying that he was going to Mount Emei in Sichuan to learn Taoism). In this time of national crisis, some people even say, "The Japanese are not to be feared; our Chinese sword immortals and knights-errant are about to be born!" These kinds of people are obsessed with absurd novels, and their intelligence is obliterated. How pitiable this is! However, the harm of these novels is not limited to this; I will only briefly mention one or two points.</p>
<p>Regarding the improvement of this problem, first, all bookstores in the market should stop printing all kinds of absurd novels from now on, and all unsold copies must be sealed and hidden. Second, those who write novels in the future must change their purpose. The content of the novels must be suitable for the times, or have scientific (simple) interest, relevance to the current situation (such as national crisis), or contain common sense, art, etc. In short, they must no longer write supernatural, superstitious, or obscene absurd novels. Third, it is best to have each novel reviewed before it is published. Fourth, more public libraries for the common people must be established in various places (because there are very few reading materials suitable for the common people in existing libraries). These libraries should specifically select the most common and meaningful reading materials for the common people, and have scholars on hand to provide guidance at any time so that the common people in society have books to read in their leisure time. In that case, their level of knowledge can at least be increased a little, and they will not engage in various useless pastimes in their spare time.</p>

<h3 id="e198">The Female Writer in the Park by Wu <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>A truly intelligent female writer, she actually sensed the intensity of the autumn. When she came to this park alone, it was exceptionally refreshing. "Ah, how refreshing it is! The red leaves are embracing me, the cool breeze is caressing me. Ah! How beautiful it is! Oh, this autumn, this poetry-filled autumn!"</p>
<p>At this moment, our female writer was greatly inspired because she truly touched things that ordinary, uninspired people could not feel. So we saw her take out the draft of her creations, as if it were her life, from her glossy handbag, and create with her gold-plated fountain pen with a rustling sound. It is most regrettable that this is, after all,</p>
<p>an empty wilderness. The beautiful sound of writing is not as crisp as it would be in a delicate study. However, her heart was filled with unrestrainable emotion, which, of course, is something that we uninspired people would not feel.</p>
<p>She continued to write, she kept writing: "...Oh! This urban serenity, this great gift of nature."</p>
<p>Pairs of affectionate men and women passed before her, and every young man looked at her with affection. This made her feel honored and also made a flash of envy surge in her heart. So she put down her pen, took out the pocket mirror that she carried with her from her handbag, and reapplied makeup to her face. Her hair was so fluffy, and her cheeks were so delicate and charming. So she felt satisfied, satisfied, especially since she was already a famous writer. So she could not help but smile derisively at those artificially made-up beautiful young women:</p>
<p>"You soulless daughters, you don't need to boast to me about your husbands in their prime. If your husband is a lover of literature and art, if your husband knows that I am a famous writer and has read my works, wouldn't he abandon you and throw himself into my arms?"</p>
<p>In this way, she felt victorious.</p>
<p>Then she heard men whispering beside her:</p>
<p>"I think she must be a female novelist. Look at her writing non-stop. Otherwise, an ordinary woman would not write in the park."</p>
<p>"No, I don't think so," said another. "She must be writing a love letter. She can't be a great female writer because we know that every great artist is unkempt and likes natural beauty. But she looks like she came from a beauty salon. She is completely dressed like a concubine and has no literary flair at all."</p>
<p>This was enough to make her angry. "Are there no exceptions among literary figures? Can't I decorate myself if I have money?"</p>
<p>However, this was the criticism of young men. Men's vision is such, and female literary figures should be like this and that. In the end, she cannot go beyond the scope of an artist, so it is not convenient to have a special stereotype.</p>
<p>So our novelist had a new understanding. She might as well temporarily put away the beautiful inspiration she had gained in the autumn and hurried out of the park.</p>
<p>In the rickshaw, her mood was so anxious. She decided to immediately go back to straighten her hair and wash off her makeup. But the thin rickshaw puller was running so slowly, apparently deliberately making things difficult for her. So she scolded loudly:</p>
<p>"You lazy fellow, don't you have legs? Why can't you run like this?"</p>
<p>This was naturally justified to her: she had the money, and she had hired this rickshaw puller. Of course, she could scold him, and it would be okay to hit him a few times.</p>
<p>She, such a writer. That's all, that's all.</p>

<h3 id="e199">The Magical Photography by Zhao Shukui <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Any school or institution that recruits or holds examinations requires a four-inch photograph in addition to certificates and diplomas. With a photograph, it is possible to verify whether the person and the photo match and to prevent the abuse of substitutions. This is indeed a good method.</p>
<p>However, yesterday I met a friend who runs a photography studio and said: Photography studios now have a newly invented mixed photography, which is a good thing to make it easier for students to apply for exams. For example, if A wants to apply to a certain school but his level is too poor, he has to find B to take his place. However, the faces in the photos are different. As long as B is scheduled to go to the photography studio with A in advance to take the photo, A will be photographed first, and then B will be photographed. If A is strong and B is thin, B might as well wear more clothes and wear them so that they look as bulky as A. If A's eyes are big and B's eyes are small, A might as well narrow his eyes, and B might as well widen his eyes. The photo taken will be eight parts like B and two parts like A. After a few weeks, B has completely faded away and becomes a very clear A. This kind of mixed photography is very expensive and costs four or five yuan per photo! Haha! Such photography is really a new invention of the 21st century!</p>

<h3 id="e200">Bumping into the Rice Basket by Jingxiang <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>In a certain section of a certain concession, there are those people selling food and opium to those blacklisted people who have lost face, bent their backs, and shrugged their shoulders. The food stores are surrounded by many idlers and ruffians who specialize in blackmail, intimidation, and pickpocketing. Those who come to buy food naturally suffer endlessly! It's just that they themselves are also guilty of private lawlessness. If they are blackmailed, they can only recognize their bad luck, just like a "mute eating coptis chinensis," they can't speak of the bitterness. It is better not to speak of it, and even if you want to say something, you don't dare to. Therefore, these ruffians and idlers can enjoy themselves in it, happy to do it, and it is not only helping to fuel their arrogance, but also leading to unbridled rampage! The sins are intertwined. There are countless servants!</p>
<p>I have a friend who often likes to joke. Once, he had some fun with that kind of idler. The story is very funny. He told me this: One night, my friend pretended to be wandering around these food stores in the French Concession, looking around idly. Before he knew it, he heard urgent footsteps behind him. I turned around and saw a man in a blue cloth short coat. I thought this must be a lookout of some kind of idler. He probably thought that I was here to buy black rice, so I simply used his plan and joked with him. Once I made up my mind, I pretended to be timid and at the same time picked up my two legs and ran forward quickly. When he saw me running fast, he followed closely. As a result, he opened his mouth to shout at me first.</p>
<p>"Hey! Friend, run slower, be sensible." While</p>
<p>saying this, he quickened his pace and came straight to my side. I took the opportunity to give him a clear greeting and saw</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>that his peaked cap was crookedly on his head, and his two eyes were slippery and scary. Fortunately, there was only one person, so I might as well play with him. So I said to him:</p>
<p>"Oh! Old friend, we are all family, so it's fine." "How much are you buying? Let's take care of each other." He said.</p>
<p>"I'm not buying much, just a little, but old friend, I'm unlucky. The money I had just ran out, so I have to ask you to walk a few more steps and come with me to my house to get it, okay?" I said to him.</p>
<p>"Where is your house?" He asked impatiently.</p>
<p>"It's just a little way, it's just ahead." I lied to him again.</p>
<p>So he just followed me, and I circled around east and west. After walking for a while, he always impatiently urged, "Have we arrived yet?" I always said to him, "Soon, soon." Walking, walking, I had already passed Avenue Edward VII. According to the rules of their idlers, there are separate sections. I thought he would be sensible and wouldn't follow, but who knew he wouldn't let go and still clung to me. I looked forward and saw that I was almost at Avenue des Deux Republiques. The red wall of the police station was already visible. So I came up with an idea and turned my head to look back at him and said:</p>
<p>"This time, we are really arriving at my house, it's just ahead." While pointing to the police station to show him. When he saw it, he immediately panicked.</p>
<p>"F***!" He didn't even finish cursing, his two eyes wide open, and he hurriedly turned around and ran away. I couldn't help but clap my hands and laugh. He had been fooled. Thinking about it now, I still find it endlessly interesting!</p>
