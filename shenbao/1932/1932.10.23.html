<p>在外患正當逼緊之際。而内戰突以爆發。魯變之不足。繼之以川禍重牀疊架。愈演愈烈。使全國上下屛息吞聲一致對外之視線。突遭一意外之轉換使敵人對我無組織無秩序之惡宣傳。而竟得現成之證明。使國聯中人在畏怯羞慚旁皇顧慮無可適從之局面下。而忽得一趁勢之藉口。使我國政府當局於焦頭爛額手忙足亂之狀態中。而倍增其惶急與煩慮。夫以一二人利害衝突之故。而使國際地位蒙如此巨大之影響。彼攘權奪利之軍閥亦於淸夜人靜之時。撫心反躬一自省察乎。亦知參之肉不足以供全國人民之醢食乎</p>
<p>當川魯禍變爆發之初。吾人豫料政府必以審愼遲迥之態度遏茲事態之擴大。然使雙方果皆覷破政府之弱點。而爲得寸進尺之要求者則政府必將窮於應付。而情勢之嚴重。將更有不堪設想者。就最近兩日消息觀之似川魯兩方形勢。皆已突趨於尖銳化。而有使政府應付感萬分之棘手者試觀軍政部長何應欽限令韓劉部隊撤回原防之皓電發出後。韓復榘之回復電文乃不在遵令撤兵。而在引咎辭職。所謂［民衆痛苦不除良心終覺未安］果曷爲而云然。讀者固不難辨其絃外之餘音矣。同時川將領所答復於行政院停止軍事行動之令文者。又爲事實上之攻下順慶進佔遂寗聯合一致作倒劉文輝之運動皆隱然有脫越局部範圍而向中央發生正面衝突之趨勢中央於此。果將何以自處。果將以何術避免此欲來之風雨乎。</p>
<p>自兩省戰事發動以來。雙方各執一詞。各極其宣傳之能事。吾人在彼烟幕空氣中。旣不明眞相之何若。又莫審戎首之誰屬。迷離惝恍自無從懸斷其曲直。但以時當國難臨頭而猶不能忍一已之意氣則［兩造均屬無恥］之考語殆爲最近情最切實之論斷中央應付方針除嚴令雙方停止軍事行動外。殆無復更孚善之策略。今日所欲問者。不在過去應付之是否得體而在今後手段之如何採擇。吾人以國民立塲言。總覺在此漂摇風雨之下。要不容再有　牆之爭。一百回吃虧。亦只能以忍耐出之。盤旋欲洩之憤燄亦只能倒咽其氣使向腹底而流。千言萬語可以八字蔽之。曰外侮當前委曲求全而已所謂政府威信。惟有留待將來之收復。趁火打刦自絕國人之軍閥。亦惟有留待將來。</p>
<p>之總算帳耳。</p>

<p>國民社二十一日華盛頓電　美國已接受軍縮會議延長國際海軍休息期、（即暫停再造新艦期）至明年三月一日爲止之議案、大約本星期内國務院即將致文日内瓦、聲明正式接受此議、並希望至明年三月以後、軍縮能有眞正進步、按延長海軍休息期、似各大國皆樂於接受、在美國方面料亦不致停緩驅逐艦之建築、惟國會所核准之一萬噸巡洋艦、則爲之展緩興工、又據美海軍總長亞丹士今日語新聞記者、政府提出國會之海軍造艦程序、猶未决定、因編製海軍預算、俾與政府撙節計劃相協調、旣極感困難、而日内瓦談判結果、又在未定之天、遂致造艦計劃之編製大受障碍、或者須待軍縮空氣澄淸之後、再製特别報告送國會、亦未可知　　國民社二十一日華盛頓電　美國務院今日下午聲稱、目下已有二十五國贊同延長海軍休息期至明年三月一日爲止之政策、英法皆在其内、惟日本已否接受、則尙未接通知、又謂美國海軍與外交大員在八月間即已與英國重行會商、冀將兩國間對於將來胡佛計劃採用後、在戰鬥艦大小與數額上之爭執、先加以調整、惟據觀察時事者意見、此種戰鬥艦問題之調整、猶爲軍縮問題達到廣大諒解前之預備手續、如洛桑公約後英法之新關係·德國之軍備平等要求·及法意海軍均等爭執等、均足爲採用胡佛减縮三分之一計劃之障碍、惟此等問題、不能同時討論、故先擇與美最有關係者首行商榷、按英國曾建議將戰鬥艦噸數減爲最大不得逾二萬五千噸、但英國在世界各地皆有海軍根據地、不妨艦身較小、美國則不然、需要較巨之艦與較大之巡航率、又以同一理由、英國主張六吋砲巡洋艦、而美國則主張八吋砲巡洋艦、因此美京方面現希望關於戰鬬艦問題、能規定一總噸位、</p>

<p>世界社云、松岡洋右由東京出發之前、東京市在日比野公會堂開會歡送、氏於席間演說其使命之意義、半官的英文日本時報載其演詞、茲從該報譯出如左、以供參考、</p>
<p>余將赴日内瓦、代表我帝國出席國聯大會、茲乘諸君歡送之機、略述余之感想、未來之國聯大會實際上乃我帝國外交上之一極大事件、以我之不材、實不勝此重任、故於受任之先、十分躊躇、但爲種種情形所迫、不得不勉効馳驅、一因滿洲國之存在、我帝國政府已與全國國民一致承認之、二因對於滿洲問題、我國亦朝野同心、主張一致、我雖無能、而在此大和民族一致的强固後援之下、不覺膽氣頓壯、遂毅然受此重任、在前此七十年以來、我國有種種光榮之進步、使世界爲之驚異、顧同時内政外交、缺陷至多、時至今日、吾人必須乘機一掃此等陳舊之缺陷、使我民族生活史上開一新頁、否則我民族將陷於崩壞、此已成爲當面之嚴重問題、</p>
<p>就外交關係言之、吾人必須將二十年來之舊賬一爲結算、此言似甚嚴重、聞者或以爲一種大戰禍將不可免、但余意並不指此、縱不免有惡化之事態發生、然事機遷變、終於和平過去、亦意中事、要之、二十年來之舊賬、有不得不淸算之勢、此乃無庸置疑者、我民族應具此决心、以待未來之國聯大會、我意此未來之國聯大會、在國聯之程序上雖亦重要、而於我民族更爲重要、因其予我民族以淸算二十年外交舊賬、重新一種國際新生命之機會故也、此不僅外交爲然、對内亦然、吾人曾從外界輸入許多事物、以助我國家之發展、然同時亦曾輸入許多不必要之事物、使我民族之品性爲之變壞、此種變壞之事態、吾人應努力舍棄之、而顯示我民族之眞品性於全世界、去年之滿洲事件及其後日本所取之一切行動、余意可以一言說明之、即我國民爲復活其[日本精神]而所爲之努力也、如是諸君倘叩予在日内瓦、將何所作、余將答曰、[當然應付滿蒙問題、]然余以爲余之應付滿蒙問題、實不過一種巧値、而余之使命之眞目的、乃在率直的對歐美人民表顯此[日本精神]及日本人民之作爲、使彼等了解之也、余信予之使命之成敗、與我民族前途有重大關係、職是之故、余信關於滿蒙問題、吾人將無所用其爭議、余不必挾一種戰鬥精神往日内瓦、我日本國民亦未必以此期望於余、蓋滿蒙問題依於滿洲國之成立、及日本之承認、而旣經解决矣、問題至此已經結束矣、吾人更無爭論之餘地、如是諸君若叩余將何所作、余敢答曰、余頃所述之根本問題、即余將從事之問題也、更親切言之、余將在日内瓦充分說明、自去秋以來日本所取之舉動及態度、皆爲公正而合法的、皆爲時勢所迫而不得不然、夫滿蒙問題旣屬如此、人將懷疑曰、其中有何根本的錯誤而需余之說明乎、余亦曾考慮及此、但此問題實極簡單、即國聯之目的爲世界和平、國聯雖曾以種種狀况討論日本之態度、然其絕無打倒日本之意願則爲余所信、美國之目的亦爲世界和平、彼雖有時作吾人所不願聞之語、然吾信其除世界和平外、亦無其他目的、至於我日本民族之誠懇願望世界和平、决不後人、因之余考慮滿蒙問題、覺實無可爭論之處、因日本國聯及美國之目的乃屬同一、然則又有何錯誤耶、余將以下述之態度說明其無錯誤、去年滿洲事件之發生、乃以前種種事情之當然結果、日本之處置此問題、自信依於最正直及最良之方針、不但爲日本之國家生存計、並恪遵明治以來相沿之國家政策、此項政策乃以保障東方之完整爲原則者、所謂東方、今指中國而言、中國目下乃在大混亂狀態之中、欲保障中國之和平、祗有一法、即確行日本之國家政策、此於世界和平亦有裨益、中國繼續反對日本之政策、此實無可如何、而歐美人民亦似認日本之舉動爲錯誤、指日本所爲徒使事態惡化、可以引起世界大戰、然就眞關心世界和平之人觀之、此不過意見不同之問題、則其究竟之决定、惟有待諸時間之判斷、倘他國認爲日本錯誤、而日本確屬錯誤、時間將證明之、吾東方人咸信因果律、下如何之種、必收如何之果、乃一定之理、吾人之所爲、究竟爲是爲非、他日必大白於天下、吾意除此之外、此時直無解釋之方法矣、</p>

<p>日本是一個有組織幷且組織比較完密的國家、牠警察的機敏、除了戰前的俄羅斯之外、現世界諸國恐怕没有人能及得牠、所以自從經濟恐慌一九二九年、（民十八年）發生以來、普遍了世界、日本當初就受了不小的影響、雖然其程度比美國德國輕些、但是在城市的失業工人增加、在鄉間的榖米跌價、與繭子低落、都使得日本整個社會有完密組織·封建的和資本主義的·軍國主義核的心、根本動搖、日本官方對於這種現象、認爲是思想問題、特别是左傾的思想、所以文部省格外注意思想善導問題、甚至專門聘幾多學者來作善導思想的工作、司法省則十分注重思想（惡化）的取締、設有專門的推事、審理關於思想犯的案作、雖然牠的文部省（即敎育部）和司法省這樣努力以取締思想、不過牠所取締只是左傾的思想、而右傾的保守團體、却反可以受保護、然而這種焚書坑儒的彈壓、究竟還是不能滅絕所謂思想運動、同時法官的頭腦硬化、更難於以超世的態度、來取締現時代的問題、所以從去年四月起到今年三月底止、據官方公開發表的思想惡化（問題）有關聯的、</p>

<p>這一年之間、正是日本軍國主義狂熱、右傾團體萬分活躍、擁護［皇統］而否定議會政制、由言論爭鬬而實行（暗殺）恐怖的時期、竟發生這樣不穩的事、論學校幾乎全日本國各專門各大學都在嚴重取締之下、傳染了思想惡化的毛病、論人數則將近千人、而三月十五和四月十五兩次案件的一般不是學生的罪犯還在外、幷且許多中產者以上家庭的子女、都得了普遍的思想傳染病、最近最明顯的是三井×董事的小姐、也是［赤色濟難會］的婦女部員、而一般的中小職員和自由職業者、更是傳染得快、警察的忙碌、差不多有一半的時間是爲了這件事、</p>
<p>這已經是日本社會尋常都有的騷動了、更有甚者、本月六日午後三時至四時光景、東京大森區川崎第百銀行大森支店、突來手持武器（布朗寗手槍）盜匪四人、於四分鐘時間、刧去該行現鈔三萬一千七百四十六元、這是日本國立憲以來、從所未有的白晝搶刧案、雖然這個案件、比五月十五日午後犬養首相被剌的案件、在表面的關係小得多、因爲所損失只有三萬一千多元、也不過就是一個刧案、然而在日本有組織有秩序的國家、這就不能說不是一件極重大的社會問題、同時該案的背景、據各報所載、都說是有共產黨的組織從中指揮、幷且這種刧掠的組織、不止一個、經過了五天的時間、警察以必死的努力、把三個主要的犯人今泉善一·西代義治·中村經一三人都捉住了</p>

<p>、只有汽車夫大木（利雄）是到十五以後纔捕着、這件案子表面上似乎因爲四個犯人的被捕、可以就此告一段落、好像可以從此天下本平似的、（贓物丨刧去的三萬一千多元、已由共黨取去）、但是事實上即一本官方也認爲這事情十分嚴重、第一固然是思想問題、共產黨組織的潛行運動之普遍、第二是他們所使用的武器的來源、値得深切注意、</p>
<p>思想惡化、在經濟恐慌的過程中、在日本積極侵略中國軍行動之下、一般的無論都淸一色的軍國主義化、不用講左傾思想不許發展、即自由主義思想的幣原喜重郎、（若槻内閣時代、九·一八事變時候的外務大臣）、也曾被［血盟團］列入黑表要暗殺他、可是左傾到極端的共產黨、竟敢藐視法紀、擅作潛行運動、且進行得非常之迅速、社會一般同情的人也很多、特别是反對帝國主義侵略這一點、從前這本只是一種思想運動、所謂實際者也祗是在工人當中的講演、以至組織工會組織政黨這些活動而已、最近半年來、竟變了性質、例如這回川崎第百銀行被刧之後、連帶破獲的機關、除有關係的人物之外、抄着三處、找到的手槍及盒子槍等、共有三十幾支、子彈約計八千餘發、這是日本空前所未有的兇事、雖然不是直接的政治上·經濟上的大問題、而這樣的槍支子彈的來源、在軍國主義組織完密的社會中、是値得我們詳細考查的、（一九三二年十月十六於東京）</p>

<p>濟南地方法院刑事第一審判决、（二十一年地字第一四一號）被告鄭繼成、男姓、年四十歲、歷城人、住濟南城内鞭指巷門牌七號、選任辯護人周慶恩律師、孫百福律師、李允升律師、右被告因殺人案、經本院檢察官提起公訴、本院判决如左主文鄭繼成預謀殺人、减處有期徒刑七年、褫奪公權七年、裁判確定前覊押日數、以二日抵徒刑一日、手槍二枝、子彈二十八粒、子彈頭一粒、均没收、</p>

<p>（十二）　程天放</p>
<p>政治大學應該怎樣辦呢、政治大學絕必不可多設、全國不要設一所或兩所就夠了、政治大學裏面分設内務、財務·交通·司法·敎育·警政·土地·測量等等科目、招收高中畢業生、授以五年的訓練、政治大學内一方面固然注重學理的研究、一方面尤其要注意人格的陶冶、團體生活的習練、和辦事能力之豢成、中國現在從事政治的人自私之觀念太强、而責任之觀念太弱、所以貪汚·腐化·因循·敷衍·傾軋·排擠的現象、在政界上暴露無餘、政治焉得而不腐敗、國家焉得而不精、我們要改革政治、首先要轉移風氣、要轉移風氣、首先要養成轉移風氣的人才、這個使命就是要政治大學担負起來的、所以政治大學特别要注重養成學生勇敢·犧牲·廉潔·純正的品格、有條理、有方法、舉重若輕的辦事能力、和衷共濟、遵守法律、服從公意的團結精神、凡是這些地方表現出缺點的、就是學業優良、也只好割愛、</p>
<p>政治大學學生在校時一切費用、都由政府供給、但是畢業以後、他的聰明才力就應該完全供獻於國家、聽國家的支配、政府斟酌他們所學科目和性質所宜、分派往地方或中央機關服務、最初一律用練習員名義、給他們以最低限度的薪水、練習期滿、再看他們的成績逐級升遷、經過相當時間的考核、確是能力優良、品格端正、不致爲習俗所染而能夠轉移風氣、然後才付以獨當一面如縣長之類的重任、當然政治大學内儘管施極嚴格的訓練、裏面出來的人誰也不敢担保個個成爲政治人才、但是假定每年政治大學畢業幾百學生、經過練習以後、有幾十人成爲良好的縣長、有幾十人成爲良好的秘書科長、（只要辦理得好這大槪不是難事）這樣每年告一批人出來、經過十年二十年以後、政治風氣必爲一變、改革政治的目標不難達到、而政治大學也算盡了牠的功用了、</p>
<p>政治大學旣然單獨設立、其他國立大學的政治法律各系都可以歸併於政治大學、至於私立大學則可以准牠們養成律師·會計師·等服務社會的專門人才、而不可以將養成政治領袖的重任放在牠們手裏、或者有人講中國人向來做官思想特别重、所以私立的法學院及法政專門學校特别多、也特别發達、如果由國家來辦理政治大學、畢業後一定任用、豈不更提倡做官思想嗎、我以爲中國人做官思想重仍然不錯、但是現在私立法學院和法政學校之多和學生之發達、却另有原因、第一、法科容易辦、不比工·農·理·等需要大宗的設備費、所以私人辦學、多半辦法科、第二、私立學校對於學生大多數是來者不拒、所以本來未必想進法科的學生、因爲别的學校考不進、只有進私立的法學院或法政學校了、我們祇要看國立浙江大學本屆招考政治系應試的只有一百十四人、而電機工程系應試的有二百人左右、就可見現在中學畢業生不是大多數想學法政了、至於做官思想之所以重、是因爲官的權利太大了、引起一班人羨慕、如果政府將官的權利减輕、責任加重、觀念立刻可以轉移、譬如說政治大學的學生固然在校時受政府特殊待遇、出校後又由政府任用、好像特别優待、但是他們的自由都供獻於國家、政府派往邊僻省分或窮苦地方去服務、他不能不去、政府給他最低限度的薪水、他不能不受、而一個工科大學畢業生假如他能力很强、機會很好、也許一出大學就可以賺百元以上的薪金、要論個人生活、他比政治大學畢業生就自由得多、舒適得多、所以如此一來、非服務觀念特别强責任心特别重的人、未必想去進政治大學、又何致於提倡做官思想哩、</p>

<p>東華克服法商</p>
<p>陳家球李義臣各一球</p>
<p>法商隊表演極有精彩</p>
<p>士别三日、刮目相看、昨日法商隊在棒球場表演之精彩誠令人不騰驚駭之至、幸而東華内有金城鐡壁之守衛、外具精銳矯健之戰士、卒自强頑能戰之勁敵手中、爭來二球、奪得勝利、凱旋而歸、</p>
<p>羣雄窺門無路</p>
<p>一時爭傳蘇格蘭名裁判台維遜、昨日在東華法商賽中、執行在滬第一次之裁判職、鳴鐘三下、開戰號起、東華先聲奪人、分兵進攻、萬象華挺身而起、球自左移中、轉成角球、吳幼良見機卽射、相距二十餘碼、切中上門柱、彈向後方、陳虞添接得來球、自右趨中、向門射擊、適中守身、一時一虎大將、包圍敵門、各逞身手、敵方柱石馬　耳身强力壯、奪球出險、</p>
<p>一球震起四座</p>
<p>法商駭濤方過、率衆侵入、馮屠吳拒於前、李關助於後、周賢言遂至英雄無用武之地、二十五分鐘時、東華大加壓迫、轉輾而成角球、萬象華　來甚佳、李義臣猛然入冲、守門心驚、陳家球着地一脚、打破龍門、一球旣得、四座大震、</p>
<p>敵將勞而無功</p>
<p>法商失去一球、毫不灰心、依然有機卽進、無空不入、然而技藝不及、球運欠佳、終上半時、以零對一占下風、下半時、精神振發、奮門甚力、中部三將特佳、兩翼尙可、惟全線不能打成一片、互相利用、是以在極佳形勢之下、每見東華破圍出險、未得達其最後之目標者、卽各自爲政之故也、十分鐘左右、右丙法凡怯曾打中一球、踢前臂適觸球、雖入無效、勞而無功、</p>
<p>頭頂功夫驚人</p>
<p>過此、東華又遭第二次之危險、蓋法商得有罰任意球之機會、其地適在罰球區域之外、内衛馬賽耳受全隊之請、親自出馬、法凡怯撥錯方向、反爲東華所得、一塲高興、因信號誤傳、毫無所得、反見萬氏自底綫一勾、陳家球趕上一脚失空、萬氏再中陳洪光隨影飛逐守者離門救急、球忽横趨右方、陳虞添見得、正中下墜、急忙前奔、忽而斜裏來了救兵、陳氏爲其所阻、有志莫伸、接後陳氏踢角球、一脚適中、李義臣躍出人羣、以頭頂球入　、二球旣勝、局勢已定、東華在均衡勢中、一轉移間、高居上風、前鋒繼續壓迫、萬分得勢、法商全力抵抗、方見無事、二次打中門柱、尤當引爲幸事、最後周賢言在空中擒得法凡怯之球、大爲全塲贊許、結果、東華二對零凈勝、</p>

<p>鄭兆佳（上海）（二比六　六比三　六比四　三比六　六比一）芬巧（香港）</p>
<p>上場兩方皆現慌張、但芬巧漸鎭靜、鄭則發球重錯疊見、芬巧以六比二勝第一盤、第二盤芬以三比零居先、過頭重壓、大告勝利、但鄭至此顯其正式功夫、連勝六局、第三盤芬又以四比二居先、但鄭連克四局、第四盤鄭以二比零居先、上前攔網、芬從其左右射之、以六比三造二比二盤和局、最後一盤、芬巧一敗塗地、不可收拾、野球滿塲、鄭以六比一大勝、</p>

<p>惠特　卡那凡洛（上海）（六比四　五比七　三比六　六比四）羅文惠　昆仲（香港）</p>
<p>上海隊開始順利、惠特之發球及壓殺、使羅文惠二人無所措手、二羅平日之合作、全歸於盡、上海隊以六比四勝第一盤、第二盤接戰甚烈、上海隊以二比零居先、但因過於自信及不經意、遂以五比七失敗、第三盤二羅以完美之合作進攻、苦戰多時、平等之數不少、兩羅以六比三再勝、篤四盤兩方皆表演極精彩、但卡那凡洛、錯誤甚多、惠特則求勝過切、漸露疲態、結果爲上海以六比四獲勝、明晨十時决勝第五盤、</p>

<p>務本奪得錦標</p>
<p>三比一壓倒海星</p>
<p>球藝眞値得稱贊</p>
<p>務本女子排球隊昨日以萬分美妙之球藝、再壓倒勁敵海星隊、奪得中靑第一屆女排球聯賽錦標、結果三比一、比數爲二十一比十二、二十一比十七、二十四比二十六、二十一比十二、</p>
<p>務本妙不可言　務本之球藝、爐火純靑、無疵可求、合作之純熟聯絡之熨貼、無以名之、只可謂妙不可言、人才平均、各勝其任、前排張李王之殺球、能奇兵突出、攻人之不備、尤以張璧如手段之辣、令人束手無法、薛志潔之中原坐鎭、後排之托救送前、皆功高勞苦、錦標隊當之自無媿色、</p>
<p>海星稍形遜色　以各個之技術、海星絕不在務本之下、其所以敗之、聯絡不佳、人才參差耳、凶猛者則高人一等、柔弱者、則過於柔弱、人才四散、聚練無從、全隊當以汪春若蘇祖琦黃杏芬三人最出色、關柳珠次之、餘者錯誤時出、位置無方、後排進則太前、時現互相擠軋、於是爲務本所乘、惜哉、</p>
<p>一下連得兩局　務本首先進攻、海星以五比一挫之、務本緊追、分數甚近、五比五、而以十一比九先勝半局、薛志潔連加四分、局面遂變、十五比九、十八比十一、李坡造成二十一比十二、務本先勝第一局、第二局之情形、海星仍難發展、又以七比十一先失半局、十六比九落後、此時黃杏芬突加三分、使海星有轉機之望、而此時薛志潔疊見失誤、海星以十七比十九僅差二分、不幸務本仍以二十一比十七勝此第二盤、</p>
<p>海星開始苦鬥　形勢惡劣之下、海星開始奮鬥、第三局上場、海星雖以三比五落後二分、蘇祖琦連增三分以六比五超出、汪香瀛又以十比九超出、不意在此好機會、杏芬與祖珍發生衝撞、其次務本經李坡之一殺、務本仍以十一比十先勝半局、此後之兩隊、分數時以一分相上下、難解、全場緊張、務本以二十比十九勝一分、經蘇祖琦之一殺、又歸平等、牽牽纒纒、直至各二十四後、海星背城借一、以二十六比二十四、奪回此第三局、</p>
<p>務本榮獲錦標　海星奪回一局、與務本以極大之威脅、果然、六比三、九比六、十比九、節節勝利、不料輪値務本章家遂發球、一連取得七分、頓成十六比十、遂成海星致命之傷、十七比十二、最後以二十一比十二四局、務本總計以三比一獲勝、兩隊戰將如下、</p>

<p>海星準備報復　海星雖再失敗於務本、據言、海星並不因此而餒、將再接再厲、臥薪嘗膽、以圖報復云、海星其勉之、</p>
<p>紀錄幾成大錯　昨日在國人對國人比賽之中、觀衆無一爲外人、裁判絕不應用外國語、因不如其他比賽、改用國語之困難、僅爲數目之比數、此爲極平顯之事實、因用英語、於是第三局中、務本實在以十五比十二居先、而其次之比數、應爲十五比十三、報告則爲十五比十四、此種錯誤、因爲正式紀錄、無從改正、結果則造成務本失敗之局面、關係出入、實太深大、且會場秩序之不佳、怪聲跳脚之惡劣現象、更不宜於中靑會場中有之、深望當局予以注意、</p>

<p>上半時爲二比零</p>
<p>西聯足球會中一致稱爲唯一勁旅之西捕隊、及實力平庸之蘭開夏隊、竟演成出乎意外之戰績、爰兩隊昨在跑馬廳交鋒、結果西捕竟以一比二受挫於蘭開夏、且上半時中、西捕備受壓迫、連負兩球、雖於下半時中、力謀報復、僅獲一球、卒以三球之總數、判分勝負、西捕威名、未免有沾</p>

<p>工人拒絕駁卸　最近半個月來、日貨來華傾銷、又漸活躍、福州方面、亦裝到不少、閩省各界、見日貸源源而來、大爲注意、各碼頭裝卸工人、與駁船工人、協議拒絕裝卸、凡日船至閩、不論貨客、槪不許代爲起卸扛運、駁船更不予轉駁、遂使日輪至閩、無法起上貨客、各工人對於非日輪亦嚴加監察、以防改裝他船、偷入福州、</p>

<p>九三老人馬相伯語録</p>
<h3 id="c225">保育兒童和尊敬女子 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 景·記·</p>
<p>相老人有時散步，沿樂善堂前走廊慢慢行，顧盼到兩傍陳列的花；好幾次我聽到相老人嘆賞花的美好，更讚頌造物主的至美好：原來古時享有盛名撒落滿地的富貴榮華，還不及田野間一朶色香味俱全的鮮百合花！</p>
<p>記得有一次，相老人特指點了一顆花樹說道：［你們仔細看看罷！］我很注意的，觀看了一會：那新生長的嫩葉是常被保護好的。一丨丨可見造物的奇妙·告訴我們人知道：保育兒童，家庭天職；因爲不能獨立的兒童，不好好地保護他們和敎育他們，就要像那没有保護好的嫩葉，或天折或失了美觀呢！］</p>
<p>接著便是［齊家］問題。相老人引易序卦說，有男女，有夫婦，然後有父子，積成了家族。又從敎義方面，說過尊敬女子。景按：閩俟陳壽凡譯述的［歐美列强國民性之訓練］，内有一段文字，頗可引用來和相老人的話印證的。（參看商務印本七十頁。）［歐美各國，都知道尊敬女子：因爲敎義宣稱，在造物主前，人格一律平等；又因尊敬聖母瑪利亞，對於一般女子，也不存玩視的卑劣心理。中世紀的騎士，更尊重這一層。怕以相沿，成爲風俗，出外乘車，對女子也要讓座的。我也應改良風俗丨至少在家庭裏，家長要守那［父道］和［夫道］；切不可對妻女任意責駡，往往闖下家庭的慘禍來！這是所謂［齊家］的第一步。］</p>
<h3 id="c226">［夫婦之道］ <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 碧</p>
<p>丨綱要三章丨</p>
<p>這年頭兒，離婚是再時髦不過的一回事。揭開天窗說亮話，離婚是再悲慘不過的一回事。丈夫少不了妻子，妻子少不了丈夫，比方一個人尋飯吃，倒有七八分像處。離了婚的丈夫，離了婚的妻子，各人恢復了自由，果然是得其所哉。但是離婚之後，一切都不免感到異常的空虚，情感更覺得特殊的煩悶，同一個人，突然的失業，像到十分。</p>
<p>做夥計，脾氣不好，就要失業。夫婦倆，時常吵嘴。打架，不免要離婚。離婚是同失業一樣的痛苦。所以要不離婚，惟有恪遵一夫婦之道］。怎麽呌做［夫婦之道］呢？哪，聽我道來。</p>
<p>丈夫有了情人，或是妻子有了情人，對手方不可吃醋。只須自己也到外面去找一個情人，各行其是。這是［夫婦之道］第一章。有一方在外面吃酒，聽戯，賭錢，胡調，對手方不可板起了臉，加以規勸，只須也照樣葫蘆，到外面去胡調。待到錢花完了，自會歇手的。這是［夫婦之道］第二章。一方面忽發脾氣，駡幾聲，打幾下，對手方切不可還口還手。待到一方面火氣退了，然後再照樣駡幾聲，打幾下。這雖是報復運動，却都能心照不宣。這是［夫婦之道］第三章。</p>
<p>上述三章，不過是［夫婦之道］的綱要，但已把［夫婦之道］的精華，槪括無遺。諸位倘使認定離婚是摩豋的勾當，不離婚，算不得時髦，那麽儘請隨便。倘使也說離婚是痛苦的，那麽，請把上述三章研究一下。若能身體力行，我敢說離婚法庭上的老爺，要打瞌睡，律師們要棄行改業了。</p>
<h3 id="c227">現代女子擇偶的標準 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>丨嫁女高三分的新觀念丨</p>
<p>在中國，男女向來是極度的不平等的，在一般人看來，眼光中誰都有重男輕女的槪念，甚至妇兒婚嫁的時候，做父母的爲伊選擇配偶的標準，也總是抱［嫁女高三分］的成見，在財產上，聲譽上，男家總要比女家高一些嫁給他們的，在這樣的情狀之下，在社會之中，階級的界限，在婚嫁上是分得很淸，無產階級的靑年，絕對没有娶到富家少女的可能。</p>
<p>在最近的幾年來，表面上一般的婦女，似乎是自覺了，婦女運動的聲浪，已波及了全國，男女平等的口號，已聽慣而成爲老調了，但我們從事實上看來，男女那裡是平等中間依然轟立着一朶很高的壁壘，因爲在婦女的自身，也大都抱着一種錯誤的觀念，自己以爲實力上總不如男子，因而使得重男輕女的成見，依舊留傳於中國社會之中，就是從婚姻問題上說來，一般的現代女子，雖是已把［嫁女高三分］的觀念打破了，在伊們心目中所選的配偶，財產上，聲譽上，已不一要男家超過於女家了。</p>
<p>但伊們呢，對於學歷的問題，却依然抱舊時的成見：高小畢業的女子，至少要嫁一個初中畢業的男子；初中須嫁高中；高中須嫁大學；在大學裡畢了業，非留學生不嫁，留學過的，找不到太上留學生，祇好遷就嫁一個同樣的留學生了，如果不適於　種標準，寗可不嫁而抱獨身主義，在這種情狀之下，顯而易見的，在女子的自身，依然承認弱於男子，要依靠男子而生活，和從前［嫁女高三分］的觀念，又有什麽分别呢，</p>
<h3 id="c228">嫁後的光陰 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 綠珠女士</p>
<p>丨都消磨在小孩的身上丨</p>
<p>當一個人在少女時代，對於未來的人生的幻夢，那個不燦爛而超越呢？但是結果怎樣？大半是失望的！以爲嫁後的人生，遠不及少女時代理想的　美，於是由失望而懊喪，由懊喪而有些灰心了！</p>
<p>實在的：少女時期是一個婦女的黃金時代，使我們每個時候緬懷着可眷念的過去。我現在已由少女而變成少婦了，我對於過去，只有沈思；對於將來，只有悠想；對於現在，只是惘然！</p>
<p>以前我想我嫁後一邊料理家事，一邊仍可看書求學，再以空餘的時間和丈夫談笑風生，以解寂寞，那知現在嫁後，淸早起來了，要收拾房間，買菜煮飯，午後還有許多針綫，以及許多雜事，簡直没有什麽工夫多了；更加現在還生了一個小孩，要喂他奶吃，要抱他，要服事他，忙得不可開交了！那有工夫還去摸着書本子？丈夫呢，爲了職務的關係，不能時常歸來，卽是歸來，又愁着柴米油鹽，所謂談笑風生，只能求之夢寐了！</p>
<p>我嫁後幸福的消減，大半爲了受經濟的壓迫，小半是爲了家務的牽纏。所幸我的丈夫對我異常體貼，我們雖缺少物質享受，却還有精神的快樂。我領養小孩也很高興，雖則我平日看見尿屎就作惡，但現在於我的小孩一些也不覺得怎樣　髒；雖則一天要和他換幾十塊尿布，但存了［應該如此］的心，也不覺麻煩了。我閒來的時候，和小孩玩玩，倒覺别有興味，我一天一天的嫁後光陰，就在這樣地消磨了！</p>

<p>丨一個男性的典型丨</p>
<p>他生長在富於自然美的鄉村裹；他是一個農家的兒子，但他受過相當的敎育他是一個最溫和的，最美麗的，最懇摰的，最多情的，最高尙的；身體智識丨都很健全的人。</p>
<p>他的溫和，並非柔順，亦非卑懦；他彷彿是春天久雨後的一朶晴光，映照著人們，便覺得到處光明，隨地愉快。</p>
<p>他的美麗，不是裝飾，不是衣衫；他生成偉大的骨骼，黝黑的皮膚，發育强盛的肌肉，敏活康健的精神，於是人們覺得他無一處不美　　他的懇摰，不是虚僞，不是剛愎；他心裏面怎樣，態度上就怎樣；不管喜怒哀樂，一切都是内心純眞的表現。</p>
<p>他的多情，是永久的，是不變的；我記得出了天花，他終日徹夜地看護著我；天花以後，面部麻了，他還是照舊地愛我。</p>
<p>他的高尙，是自然的，是主觀的；從前王百萬的女兒和李主席的妹妹曾經向他誘惑求愛，他一槪都拒絕了。他說：人生最可貴的是專一的愛。</p>
<p>他的身體，非常的康强；從來没生過病。他能騎馬，能拍球，能游泳，能競走。</p>
<p>他的智識，十分的正確，他能書，能文，能繪畫，能唱歌。</p>
<p>他自幼便生存在我的心窩裏，他的美德才能，也都日進月增地漸漸長成。我無一日一時一刻一分一秒能夠忘了他。</p>

<p>— 黃文椃</p>
<p>中國女兒，現在確是歐化了，我們每天所見到的，盡是捲髮畫眉點睛染唇聳乳凸臀的動物，在人間活躍，我譯了一篇關於婦德的文字，來貢獻在一慇摩豋太太的面前：對於服裝過度的修飾，適足證明你不諳美的眞義。每一種新裝盛行，你應注意它是否適合你的個性，一味的盲從是不行的，在家庭中不要穿退色的，有斑點的，及其他一切不潔的衣服，在晨餐桌上，應穿整潔光鮮的衣裳，因爲可使全家都得到一種莫名的歡忭。</p>
<p>新鮮空氣，適度運動，及調匀的飲食，可以給你天然的姿容，物質的美容術，是足以遮蓋你的眞美，</p>
<p>聲音柔和，是共認的一種美德。</p>
<p>在交際塲中接吻本是常事，不過也要審愼些，在未了解你朋友的態度之先，談話中，愛情上的名詞離得越遠越好，不然Dear一字之後，便會跟着Detestable一字。</p>
<p>公共汽車或電車上，有人讓位給你，你不要忘掉向他道謝，還在你所費甚微，但對方所得到的酬報，却可感了，你所帶去的小傘不要在擁擠的地方撑開，或放在進出口的地方。</p>
<p>如同兩位男姓同行，你站在中間的時候，你應挽他倆的臂，或一起不挽。</p>
<p>當你宴客的時候，你應注意所請的客人的人數不宜過多，因爲容易發生照待不週，侍候，</p>
<p>簡慢，不能盡情暢歡等弊。不要因爲一位朋友，這次宴會，没有邀你，而疑他對你的態度有些異樣，其實他也有另外的朋友，和你一時不便在一塊聚會的。</p>
<p>一位朋友，拿一件新買的東西給你當鑒的時候，你不應說：［太貴，我一定不會出這種價錢的。］這在無意中已說你的朋友是做了戇大。不要問你朋友身上所穿的新衣裳多少價錢　　你知道你朋友在開始讀一本小說的時候，你不要把書的内容及性質，自作聰明的告訴伊，因爲你能减少伊對於這書的興趣，而且書的作者能告訴伊的較你多多。</p>
<p>你會見朋友的時候，不要稱讚自己兒女怎樣聰明伶俐，不然，會引起你朋友的反感。　　當你丈夫工作疲倦回來時，你不要拿家庭中的瑣事去麻煩他。應該微笑的向着他。</p>
<p>頭髮没有整理之前，不要出臥室，穿了便衣，也不要到外面去。</p>
<p>在丈夫前，不要指摘傭人，如果有要說的話，不妨候他走開以後。</p>
<p>待你的丈夫，不要一時殷勤，一時冷淡，因爲同居生活是永遠的啊！</p>
<p>不要因爲有了兒女的緣故，便疏忽你的丈夫。</p>
<p>使你丈夫回來的時候，常常能見到活潑的兒女與潔凈屋子。</p>
<p>結婚後，你仍用當初的態度，去愛你的丈夫，這便可表現你眞誠的性格。</p>
<p>關於你個人的衣服及飾物，不可用家用費去購買，在丈夫前不可穿破的衣服。</p>

<h3 id="c231">梁作友與張宗昌　佛 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>梁作友輸財救國一事。我前日談言中曾武斷一句。梁决會有如許鉅欵。救濟國難。因從未見有分文不名之富翁也。昨見報載天津某聞人。曾派員赴黃縣秘密調查始悉梁家貧。有田半畝。僅靠一弟資助度日。梁有好友某甲。充張宗昌隨從副官。民十六張失敗。某甲携一皮箱到梁家稱將赴大連。不料某甲出外訪友一去不回。梁啓視箱内則有某外國銀行支票百餘張。共値三千餘萬元。梁恐惹禍隱忍不言。迨張被刺方擬將此欵報效國府。這種情形或者有之。則此金錢果非梁某金錢業已明白。</p>
<p>惟尙有幾種可疑之點。（一）張宗昌在魯時。手下親信的人必定很多。何以將三千餘萬之重値。僅付托於一隨從之副官。而並不派親信之人同行。（二）張在魯多時。聲勢赫奕某副官的親友亦必甚多。何以將該箱交給於一個窮措大。（三）某副官出外訪友何以竟一去不返。這原是三個疑點。此外還有兩個疑點。張宗昌失去如此鉅欵。是否張某並不提起。何以竟無一人知悉。其疑一張存外國銀行。欵子存放外國銀行的規矩。我不曉得。不過失去支票是否别無法想。丨如聲明遺失之類。丨可以收回此項存欵其疑二。假定有其他方法可以取回。則此種支票已等廢紙。該支票已是空頭。絕難兌現。這幾點原是我假定的幾個疑慮。不在話下。</p>
<p>總而言之。此說還是相近。因爲非張宗昌不會有此大財。非此不明不白之財决不會捐助三千萬之鉅也。假定此事而果確。我不免有種感想張宗昌在魯時敲剥民財。無微不致。張一擲千金。頗爲豪闊。即就小老婆而言。當時聞有二十六名之多。（現尙有十五名聞將遣散）其揮霍程度於此可想。而張在外國銀行還存三千餘萬之鉅欵。試問此種鉅欵。自何而來。無非搜括民脂民膏積成的。造孽錢不問可知。</p>
<p>書曰［貨悖而入者。亦悖而出。］張宗昌一生搜括的造孽錢。不知是何姻緣。而竟落於梁作友之手。又不知是何姻緣而仍轉效於國家想張宗昌無論如何。總算不到罷語曰。［死生有命富貴在天。］横七豎八窮兇極惡刦奪得來的。金錢總是靠不住罷。不但張宗昌如此。民國以來軍閥們的金錢或爲人侵佔以去。或分贓不匀。發生糾葛亦已數見不鮮。幾位軍閥對之也應該有些覺悟。不要再拚命地搜括以飽一己的私囊呀！孟嘗君謂積富財以遺子孫之不知何人。而忘公家之事日損文竊憂之可見。古之人積富財以遺子孫尙不値得。現在的人竟欲積金錢以給張三李四王五趙六。眞是阿戇。</p>

<h3 id="c233">礦物質肥料肥田粉及智利硝石 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 盛展能</p>
<p>肥田粉與智利硝石皆爲主要的氮質肥料，能補助動物肥料及植物肥料之不足，而它們的功效却較之天然肥料爲速，所以這於農業上有莫大的利益，在以農立國的吾國，尤當特别注意，茲特分論於下：</p>
<p>（一）肥田粉</p>
<p>肥田粉是人造以料或化學肥料的一種，近年來，上海及各大商埠輸入之肥田粉，其中以英商卜内門洋行之娥眉牌，德商愛禮司洋行之獅馬牌爲最，又華商肇豐行之九牛二虎牌，新建設公司之人獅牌，利農肥料公司之象牌亦甚著稱，此外尙有各種牌號之肥田粉，總數不下三四十種，足見肥田粉應用之廣，肥田粉之材料與成分，雖然各有不同，然大槪言之，則不外硫酸錏，硫酸鉀，硝酸鈉及過　酸鈣之數種而已。</p>
<p>肥田粉之性質　肥田粉富於氮，燐，鉀，（植物之三要素，）而天然肥料（即自給肥料，）則含量甚少，故其功效甚速，但天然肥料因富於有機物，以微生物之發育旺盛，土質逐漸改良，而肥田粉則不含有機物，故若不與天然肥料混用，則土質極易變劣，</p>
<p>肥田粉之施用　我國農民，對肥田粉素未用慣，故施用之時，務宜謹愼，第一須辨别其種類，並注意施用之分量與方法，因肥田粉效用雖速，但若施用過度時，往往使土壤中之溶液，過於濃厚而呈鹼性或酸性，以致損害植物，最合理之施用，當以堆肥，廐肥，綠肥等之自給肥料爲主　，而後加入肥田粉以補三　素之不足，以維持地力，其最當注意者，就是肥田粉不宜用作基肥，而只能供追肥之用，並須分數次施用，</p>
<p>（二）智利硝石</p>
<p>智利硝石　乃一天然之礦質肥料，產於南美之智利及秘魯等降雨稀少之礦床中，其粗礦含有一七至七五%之硝酸鈉，其餘爲氯化鈉，（食鹽，）硫酸鈉，硫酸鈉，硫酸鈣，硫酸鎂硫酸鉀等，故採掘後之粗礦，必須精製，方可供用，其精製之法，先將粗礦擊碎，置於大槽中，加水熱之，則礦石溶解，冷却後，則不溶物悉沈降於器底，智利硝石則存於溶液中，可移入他槽，曝於日光下的使蒸發而結晶，由此製得者，含有硝酸鈉達百分之九十以上，即現今市上所售之智利硝石，</p>
<p>智利硝石之性質　通常之智利硝石，約含十五至十五·五%之硝酸態氮素，易溶於水，故植物根部，可隨即吸收，但其性質極易潮解，有使土壞固結之傾向，而使土質變劣，故不宜用於水田，因不但可隨排水而致流失，且其中之硝酸亦易發生還原作用而變爲亞硝酸，對植物有害，智利硝石對於旱田之作物有極大之效用，較之肥田粉有過之無不及，</p>
<p>智利硝石之施用，智利硝石易被雨水溶解而致流失，宜依土質及作物之種類，分數回施之，施用之時期，最宜於植物生長盛行之時，若在冬季或植物生長緩慢之時期施用，則效果甚少，智利硝石爲單純之氮肥，故須與燐肥，鉀肥混用，（須稍帶酸性者，因智利硝石爲生理的鹼性肥料，）但不宜與植物性之有機肥料混用，遇萬不已或必要時，亦須選充分腐熟者，以防硝酸發生還原作用，此種天然之礦質肥料，最宜於蔬菜，茶，桑，藍等之催芽肥料，每畝可施十五斤至二十斤之多，（智利硝石容易吸收濕氣，故不宜曝露於空氣中，須儲藏於密閉之器内，以防潮解，）</p>

<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>十四日本欄刋有［學校　　費問題之</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>商榷］一文·迥環雒誦，具見作者一片婆心，無以復加，總其全意，痛陳現敎育商業化之不良，因而必須整頓納費，以蘄敎育平民化，納費合理化，此雖言切時弊，奈無以衝破事實障幕，何以故？請略加申述如次：</p>
<p>中國當前社會，因受外來資本主義之冲盪，步步朝向資本階梯前進，通都大邑，已具雛型，大抵呈露於此種社會之事態，均已商業化，此爲事實所困難者，一也，吾國大中學，率皆麕集城市，城市生活昻貴，若房租，若設備，若其他一切，無不所費不貲，二也，長衫朋友處今日之混亂社會，謀業不易，大部份祗有從興辦學校，以求出路，以故一般辦學者，不獨端賴維持已身生計，抑尤仰事俯蓄，亦舍此末由，三也，基此三大原因，乃遂使吾國敎育日趨貴族化，納費花樣，日益增多，如此而徒言納費合理化，敎育平民化，殊爲事實所難能，此即余之所以認某君理論不能見容於當前普通學校，而有待於未來社會方能辦到者。</p>
<p>然果如此而不另求出路乎？是絕不然丨余意祇有將國家財庫中之敎育經費，酌量增加，廣設官費學校，質言之，即黨政諸公，從速澈骨覺悟，稍稍减縮槍殺自家人的砲火之製造，以及少討幾位姨太太，少辦幾部汽車，自備飛機，移欵興辦學校，其最切要者，是爲復興江灣勞動大學。</p>
<p>考勞動大學誕生於民國十六年，縮小範圍於去秋，停辦於今夏，該校待遇之佳，全國學校無出其右者，學費膳費免收，固無論矣，即寒暑假之學生膳宿，亦由校中供給，且有制服書籍發給。開辦五年，惠及學子固鉅，影響社會尤大，其在吾國敎育史上，固具有可紀之一葉也，祗惜前以易培基氏長校，辦理弛寛，致鮮顯著成績，招尤當道，後以外交官王景岐氏繼任，則又風潮疊起，以致關門大吉，多少貧苦靑年，飲泣埀頭，被迫離校，此不能說吾國敎育之根本破產，當局之有意暗殺靑年！</p>
<p>自該校停辦以後，所遺大宗校產，覬覦分肥者，頗不乏人，惟因社會視綫所歸，一時尙未敢公然實行，然苟長此以往，雖已有校產保管委員會，亦定難免被人蠶食，寖化烏有。</p>
<p>是故復興勞動大學，實爲吾國敎育界之當前急務，且爲事實所可能：一因校產尙在，已有基礎，二因復興事業，較創造容易遠甚，更就此種敎育之社會需要而言，尤屬刻不容緩者也。</p>
<p>就敝見而言，復興步驟如此；（一）任命若士敎育家組織復興委員會，（二）任命純敎育家長校，（三）澈底淸理校產，（四）修葺已被倭奴砲燬之一部份校舍，（五）釐定勞動敎育敎育之根本方針，以養成生產的技術人才爲主，管理勞動生產的社會人才爲副，（六）籌備復校，招收學生，在此有尤須注意者，所招學生，務須眞正貧窮無資升學者。</p>
<p>上週報載敎育當局已有復興計劃，並傳將任命褚民誼氏長校，其果出於誠意，　則勞大之復興，或將有冀，而勞動敎育之花，或又可出現於荒漠之吾國社會矣。望我新聞界及社會人士，一致鼓吹之丨茲所言者，不過一［索引］已耳。</p>

<p>— 珩玉</p>
<p>在×××大學上課的第一星期，除外國敎授準時上課外：其餘都在第二星期開始敎授，告白上貼着幾張［淸一色］的佈告：［×××准於下星期×正式上課此佈］；此後，時常遇到的，就是有時跑到校裏，在告白上發現一張佈告：［××敎授×××先生今日有事××請假一天此佈］，於是不遠千里而來，空走一趟：不願薪水打折扣的敎授，想出補授的方法，這倒不錯，使學生學業上不受損失，不過補授的時間，學生是否有空，是一個問題；照理敎師可以補救，學生缺課，亦可請敎師補救；我很懷疑着這也許都是做Ｐrofessor的格式。</p>
<p>職員老爺是很搭架子的，自以爲××長，有事去請敎他，總是千聲不應的，有銅錢進帳的事不在此例，單講辦請入學手續，學生們在開學後一星期幾乎每天要跑一二次。</p>
<p>圖書館和石庫門房子的客堂差不多大小，裏面陳列着幾部大辭典和雜誌日報，關於學術研究的書本極少，在Ａ課目上課的時候，上Ｂ課的學生没有地方去休息，只得團聚在那裏喝茶談心，肅靜無聲的圖書館，一變而爲衆聲喧亂的茶肆了。</p>
<p>上課了，Professor×先生挾着幾本硬面的西書，很神氣地衝進課堂裏來了，像開留聲機一般，把他手裏的一套法寳，東唸幾句，西講幾段，學生在下面好像靜聽着，實則男生正在將他的面像速寫在摘記紙上，女子正在寫了小條子傳閱着，末了，Professor×先生問道：［Any　Ouestion?］他覺到没有回聲，就在下課鈴的前十分鐘前散課了：這樣的乏味，使一般闊老，繳了這Course的學費而不高興讀了。</p>
<p>C敎授在第一次上課的時候，宣佈所用的課本：［我的Textbook是×××××，是讀這Course最便宜的一本書，價洋十×元×角］。繳了五六十元的學費，還要四五十元的書籍費講義費雜費，大學校眞是$造成的，窮人的子弟，恕不招待：畢業後是否能找到三四十元的事，恐怕還是一個問題。</p>
<p>所謂大學敎育，原來如此！</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>林先生給二房東辭退房子，還是半月以前的事直到今天，他全家都寄居在友人家裏。本來，這就是很難爲情的事，因爲打擾人家總是於心不安的，何况現在連友人也是遷居，而自己的房子却還没有找着，當然，我們可以想像得出，他是如何的焦急了。於是他最後的和他夫人商量：</p>
<p>［喂，我們今天無論如何也得找着房子了。］</p>
<p>［可是到那裏去找呢？前後樓至少要二十多元，簡直去了生活費的一大半，而没有兩間房又不夠住，這樣的又要便宜又要房大，同時還要淸爽，所以你到那裏去找呢？</p>
<p>［可是你找不着不行呀，你還好意思和朋友一道搬去揩油嗎？］</p>
<p>［那末你去找罷，我是找不着了。］</p>
<p>［我去找？你看我穿得多麽蹩脚，未走進門以前，他們房東先向我身上打量一眼，不是首先關照你說，［吾此地的房錢交關大㖸，］便是老實不客氣的回答你說［借脫哉。］至於一個男人去租房子首先便會被人問［儂阿有家眷格？］那簡直是不成問題，所以還是你去比較方便一點。］</p>
<p>（難道我穿得不蹩脚嗎？）</p>
<p>［不過你還有一件棉綢旗袍，至少總可以混得過去，像我一件這樣像棺材裏掘出來的夾袍，簡直像一個小瘪三呀。］</p>
<p>「不要這樣嚕嚕囌囌，我們現在不是比衣裳的時候，你也得走一趟去。」</p>
<p>「哎，你一說便是這樣生氣。……</p>
<p>萬一没有辦法，就貴一點也租罷。」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈，你這個人就是這樣說話不負責，好大的口氣，眞是一個大眼窮鬼，我問你：你住了這樣貴的房子你拿什麽來買米，拿什麽來付娘姨的工錢呢？好容易說出口就算，虧你這麽大的年紀，簡直說話不想一的。」</p>
<p>「但是，太太，明天就要搬走，那又有什麽辦法呢？」</p>
<p>「那末你去試試看，半個月來我眞跑夠了。簡直是『三個錢一碗的豆腐漿，又要滿又要滾』這個難題目我委實辦不了。」</p>
<p>結果還是我們的林先生抖抖衣裳厚着臉皮跑去，林太太目送着他瘦弱而駝背的後影。</p>
<p>最後林太太懶懶地在床沿坐下，她覺得非常苦痛她想：</p>
<p>［這裏有人没有房了住，而有些却空着房子没有人住，眞是太不合理了。］她咀咒現代社會，她肯定；只有現實社會有了徹底的改革，才能痛快的生存。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Intensification of the Situation in Sichuan and Shandong <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>都·良·</p>
<p>Amidst the pressing foreign threats, internal warfare suddenly erupts. The chaos in Shandong is compounded by the disasters in Sichuan, piling up and intensifying. This diverts the nation's unified focus on resisting foreign aggression, providing ready-made evidence for the enemy's propaganda about our disorganization and disorder. The League of Nations, caught in a state of fear, shame, hesitation, and helplessness, suddenly finds a convenient excuse. Our government, already overwhelmed and chaotic, is further burdened with anxiety and worry. Can those warlords, driven by personal gain, who inflict such a huge impact on our international standing, reflect upon themselves during the quiet of the night? Do they even realize that their ambition cannot feed the nation?</p>
<p>When the troubles in Sichuan and Shandong first broke out, we anticipated that the government would adopt a cautious and deliberate approach to prevent escalation. However, if both sides perceive the government's weakness and seek to gain further advantages, the government will be stretched thin. The severity of the situation could become unimaginable. Recent news suggests that the situations in both Sichuan and Shandong are rapidly intensifying, making it extremely difficult for the government to respond. Consider that after the Minister of Military Administration, He Yingqin, issued a sternly worded telegram ordering Han and Liu's troops to withdraw to their original positions, Han Fuqu's reply was not to obey the order but to resign, citing that "his conscience would not be at peace until the people's suffering was relieved." Readers can easily discern the hidden meaning. Simultaneously, the Sichuan generals, in response to the Executive Yuan's order to cease military operations, have effectively captured Shunqing, occupied Suining, and united in a movement to overthrow Liu Wenhui. These actions suggest a tendency to break free from local conflicts and directly confront the central government. How will the central government handle this? What measures will be taken to avert the impending storm?</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of hostilities in the two provinces, both sides have presented their own versions of events, employing every means of propaganda. Amidst the smokescreen, we are unclear about the truth and uncertain about who is responsible. In our confusion, it's impossible to judge right from wrong. However, when the nation faces imminent crisis and yet cannot restrain personal animosities, the assessment that "both sides are shameless" is probably the most accurate and pertinent. Besides issuing stern orders for both sides to cease military action, the central government has exhausted all effective strategies. The question today is not whether past responses were appropriate, but what measures should be adopted in the future. From a national standpoint, we feel that amidst these turbulent times, we cannot afford internal strife. Even if we suffer losses a hundred times, we can only endure. The burning flames of resentment can only be swallowed and channeled inward. In short, the key is to prioritize national interests and seek compromise amidst foreign aggression. As for the government's authority, its recovery must be left for the future. And the reckoning for those warlords who exploit the situation for personal gain will also have to wait.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Tian Songyao's Troops Occupy Suining <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui's Troops Retreat to Lezhi, Anyue, Dazu, and Other Places</p>
<p>Sichuan Generals Plan to Request the Central Government to Transfer Liu's Troops to Xikang</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Tian Songyao urgently ordered his division commanders, Zeng Nanfu and Luo Naiqiong, to attack the 24th Army. On the 19th, they occupied Suining. Liu Wenhui's troops retreated in three directions to Lezhi, Anyue, Dazu, and other places. Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou all telegraphed Liu Xiang, supporting the Suining meeting and requesting him to preside over it to unify the situation in Sichuan, reduce the military, and lower taxes. The Sichuan military generals agreed to telegraph the central government, ordering Liu Wenhui to move to Xikang. There are three reasons for this major joint attack on Liu Wenhui: (1) Liu's tyrannical extortion of the Sichuan people is worse than bandits, and various regions are forming anti-tax armies, which will likely incite civil unrest. (2) Liu relies on money to collude with various army divisions and brigades in mutiny, and secretly raises assassins to murder various leaders, which have been discovered. (3) Liu secretly sends representatives to lobby disgruntled warlords in Southwest and North China, plotting to form another government to oppose the central government and make himself the leader of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou. This plan is progressing vigorously, so the various armies consider it dangerous and destructive to the overall situation, and thus unite to attack. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Chongqing telegram reports that Liu Xiang has accepted the request of over a hundred generals, including Deng, Tian, Yang, and Liu Cunhou, and sent a telegram to the central government, adopting the Qiaochuan outline and convening the Suining conference to resolve long-standing disputes. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Chengdu telegram reports that several representatives from Kang and Tibet will demand that Liu Wenhui not withdraw border defense troops. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Xu Zhongqi and others of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, summoned by Chiang Kai-shek, arrived in Hankou on the Yongnian steamer on the 22nd and are scheduled to meet with Chiang on the 23rd to discuss the Sichuan issue. Liu Wenhui has also sent representatives Dai Yusheng and Li Jianxian, who also arrived in Hankou from Chengdu on the 22nd. They reportedly stated that Liu is determined to make concessions to prevent escalation. It is also reported that Deng, Tian, Yang, and others will adopt armed mediation to resolve the Sichuan situation. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Lamas from Xikang telegraphed the central government and the military commission, stating that since the military conflict occurred in eastern Sichuan, Tibetan bandits have seized the opportunity to become aggressive and are preparing a counterattack. The situation in Xikang is again on the verge of danger, and the western defenses are extremely tense. They requested that the military leaders be ordered to quickly withdraw combat preparations and cease military actions to prevent the loss of territories that have been recovered and the continued fall of territories that have not yet been lost. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that the war in Sichuan Province was originally a matter between the two Lius, but has now become a problem between the various armies and the 24th Army. In recent days, Deng, Tian, Yang, and Liu have all sent troops to assist Li and Luo, and have also made vigorous mediation efforts. The central government is compiling reports from all sides to decide how to handle the situation, either by imposing sanctions based on righteousness or by impartial mediation. A resolution should be reached in the shortest possible time. If the Sichuan war escalates and Liu Wenhui does withdraw from Suining, then the area along the Neijiang and Zizhou east of Chengdu will inevitably become a battlefield because that place is the gateway to Chengdu and is strategically important.

<h3 id="e3">The Shandong Han Army Will Not Withdraw Temporarily <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Han Has Not Expressed Any Opinion on the Military Department's Ceasefire Method</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Han Fuqu telegraphed the National Government on the 21st to resign, but did not express any opinion on the Military Administration Department's ceasefire method telegraphed on the 19th. It is clear that he is dissatisfied with this method and whether he is truly being passive. It is reported that Chiang Bai-cheng has sent a telegram to Nanjing, saying that Han's expression has unavoidable difficulties. The government, believing that this issue is important, has reportedly telegraphed Chiang and Soong to solicit their opinions and settle the matter properly. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu told reporters today that he has replied to Minister He, ordering the front-line generals to prepare to withdraw their defenses, but if I were not the chairman of Shandong, I would have withdrawn long ago. Since I am the chairman, I cannot allow the people of Jiaodong to continue to live in dire straits. I am determined not to harm the country or disturb the people. If I cannot bear the responsibility, I will never do it. Resigning from the position of chairman means that I cannot bear the responsibility. It's like pushing a car; if I can't push it, I'll let someone else push it. In reality, I cannot withdraw the troops. If I telegraph to withdraw the troops, I am deceiving the superiors, and subordinates deceiving the superiors and officials deceiving the people are bad habits of today that I will never do. Since I have resigned, I can only wait for the central government to handle it. The Commander-in-Chief has not sent a telegram yet. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Han Fuqu telegraphed Chiang Bai-cheng, explaining the reasons for his resignation, asking Chiang to help, and wishing to withdraw from politics as soon as possible in order to resolve the Jiaodong issue. (Special Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Yantai) Although there is talk of Han Fuqu's resignation, many believe that he still wants to drive Liu Zhennian out of Jiaodong. Today, flags were hung to welcome Zhang Yue and Gu Liangmin from Jinan. The arrival of Zhang and Gu can be seen as Han's intention to occupy Jiaodong for a long time. After Zhang and Gu arrived, they said that Jimo could be taken within three days. Han's army has not yet occupied Laiyang and is about ten miles from the city. Liu Zhennian is still firmly defending Laizhou. It is also reported that Zhang and Gu told people that if Liu does not leave Shandong, Han will not give up. The wartime losses suffered by the American church in Laizhou can be appropriately compensated. (Reuters Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

He said that although there were some violent individuals among the bandits, as a whole, they were not entirely bad people. The bandit leader, Bai Batian, often sat next to his pit, lightly patted his knee and said, "I will not hurt you, but I have to intimidate your friends to prepare money to redeem you." On the fifth day of his capture, at dusk, pursuing troops were discovered. The bandits ordered them to lie in a ditch and not make a sound. They saw gun muzzles pointed at their backs, naturally they were [unable to decipher]. Bai Batian put on a commoner's long gown, calmly went forward, and greeted the pursuing troops. The soldiers asked if he had seen bandits escorting two foreigners past this place. Bai replied, "Yes, I saw them. They went south half an hour ago." The soldiers thanked him and went south together. After they left, Bai then made them go north. Sometimes they traveled at two o'clock at night, but they did not move frequently after October 13th. The bandits treated them quite well, regarding them as treasures. When parting, some were reluctant to leave, he said. Kirkland immediately went to PanYang to resume his work at the Asiatic Petroleum Company.

<h3 id="e63">Strange Ship Discovered in the Pacific Ocean <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Disguised as an Oil Tanker</p>
<p>Movement Elusive and Skillful in Avoiding</p>
<p>Specializing in Tailing US Warship Movements</p>
<p>National News Agency, San Pedro (California), 21st - The movements of the US battle fleet are now closely guarded secrets because a strange ship without a flag has been found tailing the movements of the US fleet for more than a month. The ship has an extraordinarily high speed and moves in an elusive manner, skillfully avoiding capture. US warships have tried to capture it several times but have not succeeded. The ship is now called the "Question Mark." Its intelligence will be tested again in the next few days. Therefore, the commander of the US fleet today kept secret the names of the battleships assigned to target practice on the decommissioned warship Utah. Moreover, according to personnel on the flagship, details of future warship movements will not be announced in advance, in order to avoid being spied upon. The "Question Mark" strange ship has the appearance of an oil tanker, but judging from its high speed, it must be a disguised destroyer. Every time the US warships sail outside the 12-mile territorial sea limit, the strange ship is seen hovering nearby. Sometimes the ship even sails to the 12-mile territorial sea line, but upon seeing the US warships, it drifts away, out of reach. Attempts to intercept its wireless communications have also been unsuccessful. After the US Navy discovered the strange ship, they recalled that during the joint San Francisco-Hawaii naval exercises this summer, an oil tanker was also frequently seen. When the US fleet sailed from San Pedro to San Francisco before going to Hawaii for exercises, the oil tanker also departed from San Pedro on the same day and followed closely behind. Later, the oil tanker sailed to Hawaii. During the exercises, it was seen several times following closely near the battleships. However, at that time, the oil tanker flew the flag of a certain separatist nation, and the owner of the ship was also well known to several naval officers. When it docked in San Francisco, a naval officer boarded the ship to visit the owner and confirmed that the sailing date coincided with the US fleet by chance and was not intentionally tailing, so after it appeared in Hawaii, US naval personnel did not suspect that it was engaged in espionage.</p>
<h3 id="e64">US Accepts Extension of Armaments Truce by Four Months <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Japan Follows Suit and Expresses Acceptance</p>
<p>But Declares Ship-Building Program Must Continue</p>
<p>US Expresses Opposition to Proposal to Reduce Tonnage of Battle Cruisers</p>
<p>Havas, London, 21st - It is announced here that the "Armaments Truce," which expires on November 1st, has been acknowledged by the United States as being extended until March 1, 1933. Its official letter of acknowledgement will be sent to Geneva in the next few days. According to official circles, the aim of extending the armaments truce is to allow the Disarmament Conference to reach an agreement on naval armaments.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 21st - The United States has accepted the proposal to extend the international naval holiday (i.e., the period of suspending the construction of new ships) until March 1st next year. The State Department will formally send a letter to Geneva within this week to formally accept this proposal and hopes that there will be genuine progress in disarmament by March next year. It seems that all major powers are happy to accept the extension of the naval holiday. On the American side, it is expected that the construction of destroyers will not be delayed, but the construction of the 10,000-ton cruisers approved by Congress will be delayed. US Navy Secretary Adams told reporters today that the naval construction program submitted by the government to Congress has not yet been decided. It is extremely difficult to prepare the naval budget to coordinate with the government's austerity plan, and the outcome of the Geneva talks is still uncertain, which has greatly hampered the preparation of the construction plan. It may be necessary to wait until the atmosphere of disarmament clears up before submitting a special report to Congress. National News Agency, Washington, 21st - The US State Department announced this afternoon that twenty-five countries have now supported the policy of extending the naval holiday until March 1st next year. Britain and France are among them. However, it has not yet received notification as to whether Japan has accepted. It also stated that US naval and diplomatic officials had re-consulted with Britain in August to try to adjust the disputes between the two countries regarding the size and number of battle cruisers after the adoption of the Hoover Plan. However, according to observers, the adjustment of these battle cruiser issues is still a preparatory procedure before the disarmament issue reaches a broad understanding. Like the new relationship between Britain and France after the Lausanne Convention, Germany's demand for equal armaments, and the dispute over naval equality between France and Italy, are all obstacles to the adoption of the Hoover plan to reduce armaments by one-third. However, these issues cannot be discussed at the same time, so the one most closely related to the United States is chosen for consultation first. Britain has proposed reducing the tonnage of battle cruisers to a maximum of no more than 25,000 tons, but Britain has naval bases all over the world, so a smaller ship is not a problem. The United States is different and needs larger ships with a larger cruising range. For the same reason, Britain advocates 6-inch gun cruisers, while the United States advocates 8-inch gun cruisers. Therefore, Washington is now hoping that a total tonnage can be stipulated regarding the battle cruiser issue.</p>

<p>Within this tonnage, Britain can build 25,000-ton battle cruisers, while the United States can build 35,000-ton ships. Dentsu, Tokyo, 32nd - The Japanese government has recently expressed its acceptance of extending the naval holiday for four months, but the already approved by the Diet, and the already under construction or fulfilling contracts, of course do not bind the established naval armament plan, that is, on the premise of this interpretation.</p>

<p>To Settle Twenty Years of Old Diplomatic Accounts</p>
<p>The Manchurian Issue Said to Have No Room for Argument</p>
<p>Japan is Not Wrong and Time Will Prove It</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd - Japanese representative Yosuke Matsuoka set off last night via Siberia for Geneva to attend the League of Nations General Assembly to discuss the Lytton Report. He is expected to arrive in the Russian capital on November 30th and will stay for four days to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Karakhan to discuss Soviet recognition of "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>The World News Agency said that before Matsuoka Yosuke departed from Tokyo, the city of Tokyo held a farewell meeting at the Hibiya Public Hall. He delivered a speech on the meaning of his mission at the meeting. The semi-official English-language Japan Times published his speech, which is translated from the newspaper for reference as follows:</p>
<p>I will go to Geneva to represent my Empire at the League of Nations General Assembly. Taking advantage of your farewell meeting, I will briefly describe my feelings. The future League of Nations General Assembly is in fact a very large event in my Empire's diplomacy. I am unqualified and unable to shoulder this important task, so I hesitated greatly before accepting the task. However, forced by various circumstances, I had to make an effort to serve. Firstly, the existence of Manchukuo has been unanimously recognized by my Empire's government and the entire nation. Secondly, on the Manchurian issue, my country has the same views in the government and among the people. Although I am incompetent, under the strong support of this united Japanese nation, I feel emboldened and resolutely accepted this important task. In the past seventy years, my country has made various glorious advances that have amazed the world. However, at the same time, there are many shortcomings in domestic and foreign affairs. Today, we must take the opportunity to sweep away these old shortcomings and open a new page in our nation's history, otherwise our nation will fall into collapse. This has become a serious problem facing us.</p>
<p>In terms of diplomatic relations, we must settle the old accounts of the past twenty years. This statement seems very serious, and those who hear it may think that a major war disaster is inevitable. However, I do not mean this. Even if there are aggravated events, the situation will change and eventually pass peacefully. In short, there is an inevitable trend to settle the old accounts of the past twenty years. There is no doubt that our nation should have this determination to face the future League of Nations General Assembly. I believe that this future League of Nations General Assembly is important in terms of the League of Nations procedures, but it is even more important to our nation because it gives our nation the opportunity to settle twenty years of old diplomatic accounts and restart a new international life. This is not only true for diplomacy, but also for domestic affairs. We have imported many things from the outside world to help our country's development, but at the same time, we have also imported many unnecessary things that have corrupted our nation's character. We should strive to abandon this kind of corruption and show our nation's true character to the world. Last year's Manchurian Incident and all the actions taken by Japan afterwards can be explained in one sentence, that is, the efforts of our people to revive their [Japanese spirit]. If so, if you ask me what I will do in Geneva, I will answer, [Of course, I will deal with the Manchurian and Mongolian issues.] However, I believe that my handling of the Manchurian and Mongolian issues is only a coincidence, and the true purpose of my mission is to directly express this [Japanese spirit] and the actions of the Japanese people to the people of Europe and the United States so that they can understand it. I believe that the success or failure of my mission has a major relationship with our nation's future. Therefore, I believe that regarding the Manchurian and Mongolian issues, we will not use any arguments. I do not need to go to Geneva with a fighting spirit, and the Japanese people may not expect this of me. The Manchurian and Mongolian issues have already been resolved with the establishment of Manchukuo and Japan's recognition. The issue has already ended here, and we have no more room for argument. If so, if you ask me what I will do, I dare to answer, the fundamental issues I mentioned earlier are the issues I will be engaged in. More specifically, I will fully explain in Geneva that the actions and attitudes taken by Japan since last autumn are all just and legal, and all are compelled by the times and cannot be avoided. Since the Manchurian and Mongolian issues are like this, people will doubt and say, what fundamental mistakes are there that need my explanation? I have also considered this, but this issue is actually very simple, that is, the purpose of the League of Nations is world peace. Although the League of Nations has discussed Japan's attitude in various situations, I believe that it has absolutely no intention of overthrowing Japan. The purpose of the United States is also world peace. Although it sometimes says things we do not want to hear, I believe that it has no other purpose besides world peace. As for the Japanese people's sincere desire for world peace, they will never lag behind others. Therefore, I consider the Manchurian and Mongolian issues and feel that there is really no room for argument because Japan, the League of Nations, and the United States have the same goals. Then, what mistakes are there? I will explain that there are no mistakes with the following attitude. The occurrence of the Manchurian Incident last year was the natural result of various things in the past. Japan's handling of this issue is confident that it is based on the most upright and best policy, not only for the survival of Japan as a nation, but also in strict compliance with the national policy followed since the Meiji era. This policy is based on the principle of ensuring the integrity of the East. The so-called East now refers to China. China is currently in a state of great chaos. There is only one way to ensure China's peace, and that is to firmly implement Japan's national policy. This is also beneficial to world peace. China continues to oppose Japan's policy, which is really impossible. The people of Europe and the United States also seem to think that Japan's actions are wrong, pointing out that Japan's actions only make the situation worse and may cause a world war. However, from the perspective of those who are truly concerned about world peace, this is just a matter of different opinions, and the ultimate decision can only wait for the judgment of time. If other countries think that Japan is wrong, and Japan is indeed wrong, time will prove it. We Orientals all believe in the law of cause and effect. It is a certain principle that whatever kind of seed is sown, what kind of fruit will be harvested. Whether what we do is right or wrong will one day be revealed to the world. I think that other than this, there is no way to explain it at this time.</p>

<p>Arouses Russian Anger</p>
<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 21st - Judging from today's Russian newspapers rising up to attack Britain's abandonment of the Anglo-Russian commercial treaty, it is evident that the previous reports that the Soviet Russian authorities did not strongly oppose this move and did not plan countermeasures were not accurate. The Russian government's official newspaper Izvestia commented today, listing the anger of financial and economic circles, claiming that the British abandonment of the treaty was the price of avoiding economic cooperation between Canada and the United States. This move shows that British imperialists are in a dilemma, so they vacillate between Japan and the United States in the Far East, and in Europe they cannot resolve the Franco-German stalemate and meekly submit to French pressure, even issuing a memorandum to Germany that is enough to degrade their status, and so on. Subsequently, they protested against the British conservatives' claim that Soviet Russian exports were dumping and forced labor. In addition to describing the anger of various circles, the Communist Party's official newspaper Pravda also claimed that the conspiracy of the Peverel Brook and Churchill factions cannot hinder the development of Soviet Russia.</p>

<p>Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Injured</p>
<p>National News Agency, Vienna, 21st - A verbal battle broke out in the Austrian Parliament today, followed by a physical brawl. The starting parties were Prime Minister Dolfuss and Social Democratic leader Otto Bauer, and the reason was that the newly appointed Public Security Commissioner Veda ordered a ban on demonstrations by members of the National Socialist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and the Communist Party. Otto Bauer attacked this ban in parliament, and Dolfuss then accused Otto of being a Bolshevik, and Otto retorted, calling Dolfuss a stupid slave. Under the invective of both parties, the government party began to attack the Communist Party seats. Ink bottles, ashtrays, and glassware flew for a time. As a result, Dolfuss, Commerce Minister Jakomini, and many Communist Party leaders were covered in ink and had to flee injured.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e76">Future Chronicle of a Japanese-American Naval War (Continued, Part 3) <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>(IV) Japan's War Plans Against Britain and America. As mentioned above, if Britain and the United States were to act together to subdue Japan, they would need to accomplish the following: (1) annihilate the Japanese fleet; (2) sever Japan's maritime transportation; (3) conduct aerial attacks on major Japanese cities, important industrial centers, naval ports, and strategic harbors; (4) defeat the Japanese army in Manchuria, China, thereby ending Japan's activities in Manchuria. The first question, then, is whether the British and American fleets are capable of annihilating the Japanese fleet. We can infer this from the actions of both sides. The concentration of the American fleet in Hawaii and the British fleet in Singapore indirectly defends their own colonies. The American fleet cannot move to Singapore across the Pacific Ocean because it must consider the defenseless state of the Pacific coast. Likewise, the British fleet cannot concentrate in North America and Hawaii because only twenty percent of the entire British fleet can be used in the Pacific. At the beginning of the war, British territories such as Australia and New Zealand will feel greatly uneasy and will have to recall some of the fleet. Although a joint British-American fleet is not impossible, they would need to combine both fleets to gain a clear advantage in order to defeat the Japanese fleet. The point of union must be chosen where the route is shortest, safest, and allows for sufficient communication. Under these conditions, the meeting point for the two countries should be somewhere near New Guinea, as there are harbors suitable for anchoring fleets. Once the British and American fleets have united, the next step is to determine their operational objectives. What are these objectives? (1) The British and American fleets will establish bases in one or two locations in the South Pacific Islands to facilitate entry into the Sea of Japan. The first step is to lure the Japanese main fleet into action while simultaneously using aircraft to bomb major Japanese cities, industrial centers, naval ports, and strategic harbors, thus implementing an aerial war. Fast cruisers and submarines will be used to cut off Japan's maritime transportation lines, and attempts will be made to occupy the Ogasawara Islands and Guam. (2) In the West Pacific, the combined fleet will also select a location near the battlefield as a naval base. However, if Japan initiates hostilities, it will quickly seize the Philippines and Guam. Therefore, the two countries' fleets must transport substantial ground forces, numerous transport ships, and special units for repairs and supplies to these locations. However, since the Japanese army has already occupied these two locations, the transport of these units will be monitored by the Japanese fleet, making passage across the ocean difficult. As a result, fierce battles will inevitably occur. Even if the two locations are retaken, the sacrifices on both sides will be significant.</p>
<p>The British and American fleets are each composed of light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. In particular, the five Kent-class 10,000-ton cruisers of the British East Indies Fleet and the newest submarines of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet are well-known naval forces worldwide. The British deployment of high-speed, large cruisers can assist Australia and New Zealand in the event of war, and the U.S. deployment of submarine squadrons can also attempt to disrupt Japan's major maritime transportation lines. Therefore, when war breaks out, both countries' fleets will each undertake their original missions. One side will dispatch other warships to defend the Philippines and Hong Kong and cooperate with British submarines to disrupt maritime transportation lines. If the situation changes, they can move towards Singapore to link up with the British fleet. (It should be noted that the five British 10,000-ton cruisers will first concentrate in Singapore to join the main fleet and aircraft carriers arriving from Europe, and then be dispatched to Australia and New Zealand.) Examining the combined British and American fleets, the main force directly participating in the war will be two aircraft carriers each, five 10,000-ton cruisers, and a number of light warships. The ratio between the two countries and Japan is approximately 1.0 to 0.59. Assuming 65% of the forces are engaged in equal combat with the United States in the West Pacific, the remaining 59% will be at a disadvantage and will inevitably be defeated by us. If Japan does not fight, it should already have the best way to resist. What is the method? It is to disrupt the union of the British and American fleets. Below is a description of how our country should restrain the British fleet's actions and disrupt the American fleet's advance after the start of the war: (1) Blockade the Panama Canal; (2) Send surprise attack units to fight against the enemy along the American Pacific coast; (3) Conduct aerial attacks on cities along the American Pacific coast via Alaska; (4) Dispatch a portion of the fleet to maneuver in the Pacific to restrain the American fleet in that area; (5) Further attack the enemy fleet and send surprise attack units to intercept the westward advance of the American fleet, reducing its strength. At the same time, take advantage of favorable sea areas in the West Pacific to ambush with the main force; (6) Attack the rear supply lines of the American fleet; (7) Disrupt maritime trade between the United States and foreign countries, implementing a trade disruption war; (8) Secure maritime control of the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea, and a portion of the South China Sea to ensure Japan's important maritime transportation lines, allowing for the maintenance of a long-term war; (9) Defend enemy base locations; (10) Use the air force to attack important locations in mainland China and occupy them.</p>
<p>(V) Japan's Victory or Defeat in a War Against Britain and America. We have briefly described the simulated strategies of attack and defense. However, to determine the outcome of this great war, the following two or three characteristics must be explained in detail.</p>
<p>(A) The Submarine Issue. The United States has a larger number of submarines than Japan. According to the 1929 Naval Yearbook, the U.S. Navy's current holdings are as follows:</p>
<p>Six V-class, fifty-one S-class, three T-class, twenty-seven R-class, sixteen O-class, nine H-class, three N-class, four L-class, and eight K-class.</p>
<p>A total of one hundred and twenty-four vessels, with a total tonnage of ninety-three thousand five hundred and ten tons.</p>
<p>Among these large submarines, the ocean-going submarines with a displacement of over 1,000 tons are slightly weaker. Most are small, coastal defense submarines. Only the T-class submarines are over 1,000 tons, and the V-class submarines are over 2,000 tons. The S-class submarines are newer, but most are small vessels of 800-900 tons. The R-class and below, O, H, L, and K-class submarines are all below 500-600 tons and are over ten years old. What is the strength of the Japanese submarines? From Showa 3 (1928) to the present, it is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Sixty-seven I-class, sixty-eight Ro-class, and ten Ha-class, for a total of eighty-one completed vessels, with a total tonnage of fifty-eight thousand five hundred and sixteen tons. Others are still under construction and fitting out.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that there is a difference of forty-three vessels compared to the United States. In terms of tonnage, there is a difference of only 13,000 tons. In terms of overall strength, the ratio is 1.0 for the US and 0.85 for Japan. The strength and quality of Japanese submarines already surpasses that of the United States. Not only that, but among the world's five major naval powers, Japan's submarine force ranks first. The following table lists the details:</p>
<p>Category Vessel Count Tonnage</p>
<p>Great Britain Fleet Submarine 5.00 5.00</p>
<p>Sub first line 5.00 5.00</p>
<p>United States Same as above 3.46 3.75</p>
<p>7.81 7.63</p>
<p>Japan Same as above 8.84 7.67</p>
<p>7.03 6.36</p>
<p>France Same as above 1.15 2.21</p>
<p>6.56 8.30</p>
<p>Italy Same as above 1.15 1.25</p>

<h3 id="e77">Japanese Leftist Thought Under Military Fever <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Japan is an organized and relatively meticulously organized country. Its police are so adept that, aside from pre-war Russia, perhaps no other country in the world can match them. Therefore, since the economic crisis that began in 1929 (Year 18 of the Republic), which spread throughout the world, Japan initially felt a considerable impact. Although the extent was less than in the United States and Germany, the increase in unemployed workers in the cities and the decline in rice and silk prices in the countryside shook the entire Japanese society, which has a tightly knit organization, feudalistic and capitalistic elements, and a militaristic core. Japanese officials consider this phenomenon to be a problem of thought, especially leftist thought. Therefore, the Ministry of Education pays particular attention to guiding thought, even hiring several scholars specifically to guide thought. The Ministry of Justice, on the other hand, focuses heavily on suppressing (deterioration of) thought, with specialized judges to handle cases involving thought criminals. Although the Ministry of Education (i.e., the Ministry of Education) and the Ministry of Justice are working hard to suppress thought, they only suppress leftist thought, while right-wing conservative groups are protected. However, such suppression, reminiscent of burning books and burying scholars, cannot eradicate the so-called thought movement. At the same time, the rigid mindset of the judges makes it difficult for them to address contemporary issues with a transcendent attitude. Therefore, from April of last year to the end of March of this year, according to publicly announced official data related to the deterioration of thought (issues):</p>
<p>Universities 41, Students 262</p>
<p>High Schools 51, Students 410</p>
<p>Professional Schools 18, Students 51</p>
<p>Vocational Schools 22, Students 79</p>
<p>Normal Colleges 5, Students 28</p>
<p>Secondary Schools 11, Students 32</p>
<p>During this year, when Japanese militarism was rampant, right-wing groups were extremely active, supporting the ["Imperial Lineage"] while denying the parliamentary system. A period of verbal disputes escalated to acts of (assassination) terror, resulting in such unstable events. The statistics show that schools throughout Japan, including professional schools and universities, were under severe scrutiny, yet they were infected with the disease of thought deterioration. The number of individuals involved is nearly a thousand, excluding the general criminals involved in the March 15th and April 15th incidents who were not students. Furthermore, many children from middle-class and higher families were widely infected with the thought disease. The most recent and obvious example is the daughter of a Mitsui × director, who is also a member of the women's section of the ["Red Relief Society"]. Ordinary middle and small-sized clerks and freelancers were even more susceptible to infection. The police are busy, spending almost half their time dealing with this issue.</p>
<p>This is already a common disturbance in Japanese society. Even more serious is the fact that on the 6th of this month, from 3 PM to 4 PM, four armed robbers (with Browning pistols) suddenly appeared at the Omori Branch of the Kawasaki Daihyaku Bank in the Omori District of Tokyo. In four minutes, they stole 31,746 yuan in cash from the bank. This is the first daytime robbery case in Japan since the establishment of its constitution. Although the case is less significant on the surface than the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai on the afternoon of May 15th because the loss was only over 31,000 yuan, it is still a major social problem in an organized and orderly country like Japan. At the same time, according to reports in various newspapers, the background of the case indicates that a communist organization was directing it, and there is more than one robbery organization. After five days, the police, with a do-or-die effort, captured the three main criminals: Zenichi Imaizumi, Yoshiharu Nishidai, and Keiichi Nakamura.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Continued Important News <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Only the chauffeur, Toshio Oki, was apprehended after the 15th. On the surface, it seemed that the case could be considered closed with the arrest of the four criminals, and everything would return to normal (the stolen 31,000+ yuan was taken by the Communist Party). However, in reality, even the official authorities consider the matter extremely serious. First and foremost, it is a matter of thought. The widespread clandestine movement of communist organizations and the source of the weapons they use warrant careful attention.</p>
<p>Amid economic turmoil and Japan's active military aggression in China, the general atmosphere is uniformly militaristic. Not only are leftist ideas forbidden from developing, but even liberal thinkers like Kijūrō Shidehara (Minister of Foreign Affairs during the Wakatsuki Cabinet during the September 18th Incident) were placed on a black list for assassination by the ["Blood Brotherhood"]. Yet, the Communist Party, which is extremely leftist, dares to disregard the law and conduct clandestine movements, and it is doing so very quickly. Many people in society sympathize with them, especially with their opposition to imperialist aggression. In the past, this was merely a thought movement; practical actions were limited to lectures among workers and the formation of labor unions and political parties. In the past half-year, however, the nature of the movement has changed. For example, after the robbery of the Kawasaki Daihyaku Bank this time, searches of related locations turned up over thirty pistols and box cannons, and approximately eight thousand rounds of ammunition. This is an unprecedented and terrible incident in Japan. Although it is not a direct political or economic problem, the source of such guns and ammunition in a militaristic and well-organized society is worth examining in detail (Tokyo, October 16, 1932).</p>
<h3 id="e79">Sichuan War Expanding Daily <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang's Troops Garrisoned in Hubei Prepare to Continue Operations in Sichuan</p>
<p>Wuhan University Students from Sichuan Telegraph Pleas to Cease Conflict and Resist Foreign Enemies</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence. The unfortunate Sichuan war has erupted at a time when national crisis is imminent. According to telegrams from Sichuan, intense fighting has broken out between the two sides of Qing Shun. The situation is tense throughout Eastern Sichuan, and the situation is likely to escalate. Guo Xun's brigade of Liu Xiang's troops stationed in Hubei, which was previously ordered to return to Sichuan, has now joined the operations in Shunqing. The area around Jingzhou and Shashi is being defended by Liu Guangyu's brigade of the Second Division. Fan Shaozeng's troops of the Fourth Division, which are also a strong force for suppressing bandits in Hubei, have reportedly been recalled from the front line to concentrate in Jingzhou and Shashi, with talk of continuing into Sichuan. The tension in Sichuan is evident. When the two Lius came into contact, the second-tier generals of Sichuan sent a joint telegram proposing to convene a Suining Conference to resolve the Sichuan situation. Deng Xihou, Liu Cunhou, Yang Sen, Tian Songyao, etc., have recently expressed their agreement, and response telegrams have been arriving in Hankou continuously. On the surface, everyone hopes for peace, but whether this is truly the case is uncertain. The generals of Sichuan each have their own agendas, and the mutual restraint of the two Lius is welcomed by Deng, Liu, Yang, and Tian. Sichuan natives in Hankou are deeply aware of the complexity of the Sichuan situation and hold many anxieties. On the 21st, Sichuan students at National Wuhan University telegraphed all parties, urging them to cease conflict and resist foreign enemies, and not to harm the country and its people. The original telegram reads as follows: [To Commander Liu of Chongqing, Commander Liu of Chengdu, Commander Deng, Commander Tian of Santai, Commander Yang of Guang'an, Sichuan citizens have suffered from war for a long time and are tired of war. For the past twenty years, chaos has followed chaos, and bandits are rampant. The land once known as the "Land of Abundance" is now a "Realm of Ghosts." Why is Heaven so unkind to Sichuan? You, gentlemen, have received the generous support of your hometown and the affection of your elders. You hold the power to balance and wield the authority to command. Raising your arms and shouting would surely be enough to reverse the declining situation and illuminate the future. Our expectations are no more urgent than this. Moreover, since the national crisis occurred last year, the divine land has been sinking. To save the nation, we must first save ourselves. Fortunately, the military and political leaders of all provinces are able to unite sincerely to seek renewal, and the general public is also working to survive. At this time, owls are crying on the branches, thinking of spying on our homes. There should be no internal strife, and no one should be a leader of national harm. You, gentlemen, have started wars for private interests, regardless of the nation's survival. The bad news has arrived, and we are filled with fear and anxiety. For your sake, the best option is to request permission to kill the enemy, fulfill the military's duty to defend the country, and avenge old grievances. The second best is to cultivate and educate, repay the support of the people, and build a new nation. If you indulge in temporary pleasure and disregard the condemnation of future generations, pursue personal gains, and disregard the nation's peril, that is the worst, and you, gentlemen, should despise and scorn it even more. Our association cares about our homeland and cannot bear to see the villages in ruins. We advocate the gentlemanly virtue of loving others with virtue and look forward to your great achievements. We have presented everything in detail and hope you will understand clearly. We hope that you will cherish yourselves and love others and not become a laughingstock to the world. Our hearts are tormented, and we cannot express all that we want to say. The Sichuan Students Association of National Wuhan University bows. ] (October 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Hubei Province Reduces Administration Again <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence. Hubei Province's financial difficulties have reached an extreme. Monthly revenue is only 1.2 million yuan, while expenditure reaches 1.9 million yuan, leaving a shortfall of over 700,000 yuan. The Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression sent personnel to investigate earlier this month, confirming a plan for reorganization. He instructed the provincial government to strictly implement austerity measures and stipulated that the total amount of administrative expenses each month should not exceed 700,000 yuan. He ordered the revision of the new budget for the 21st year of the Republic, to be implemented from October 1st. After receiving the order, the provincial government consulted with its affiliated agencies and decided to cut what should be cut, reduce what should be reduced, and merge what should be merged. After spending a long time, the new budget was drafted and submitted to the headquarters for review. After being reviewed by Jia Shiyi, who was designated by the headquarters to be responsible for the review, it has been completed. However, the monthly expenditure of the new budget is still over 800,000 yuan, which is far from the stipulated amount of 700,000 yuan. Therefore, the provincial government was instructed to re-compile the budget, and detailed instructions were also given on the points that should be cut and reduced. The provincial government put forward the 46th meeting for discussion on the 21st, and decided to follow the order to reduce further. It is reported that no fewer than ten agencies will be cut or merged, such as the Autonomous Preparatory Committee, the Provincial Hospital, the Public Property Clearing Office, the Debt Donation Office, the Police Academy, the Wuhan Ferry Office, the Provincial Wireless Radio Station, and the Music Corps. They will either be merged into the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Departments, or be shut down altogether. The departments themselves are also economizing, and all incompetent personnel will be dismissed. In order to clarify the significance of cutting expenses, the headquarters re-ordered the provincial government on the 21st, stating that the most important significance of the headquarters' order to cut various expenses in the province this time is, on the one hand, to maintain the province's financial resources so that they will not fall into the danger of provincial financial bankruptcy due to increasing accumulated deficits. On the other hand, it is to obtain satisfactory administrative efficiency with appropriate financial resources. Therefore, agencies that can be cut and abolished should be cut and abolished, and those that can be merged should be merged. However, the headquarters does not advocate for a universal reduction of the items listed, so that the amount of salary each person receives is too low, causing employees to experience difficulties in life and reducing work efficiency. The provincial government should immediately, based on this meaning, strictly assess the civil servants of its own agencies and affiliated agencies, and immediately implement the dismissal of those who are redundant or have low capabilities. The quantity should be approximately the same as the quantity of public officials' original salaries, so that employees can still receive considerable salaries after the budget reduction and will not be disheartened and distracted due to low salaries. It is expected that the result of the austerity measures of the agencies this time will be to reduce personnel without reducing salaries (October 21st).</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Zheng Jicheng Case Has Been Judged <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Sentenced to Seven Years, Will Appeal</p>
<p>Full Text of the Judgment Released</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Zhang Zongchang arrived in Jinan from Beijing on September 2nd, stating his intention to return to his hometown of Ye County, but was unsuccessful. On the afternoon of the 3rd, he hastily returned to Beijing. At the Jinan Railway Station, Zheng Jicheng, the nephew of Zheng Jinsheng, who was previously killed by Zhang, and his follower Chen Fengshan, ambushed and killed him. At the same time, Zhang's bodyguard, Liu Huaizhou, was also shot and killed, and Liu Qingxun was injured. Zheng immediately declared that he was avenging his uncle and surrendered to the station's law enforcement team. He was subsequently detained in the military court of the Third Route Army Headquarters. This incident caused a nationwide sensation. Many people inside and outside the province considered Zheng's actions righteous and requested the government to pardon him. On the 24th of last month, the provincial government, following orders from the central government, transferred Zheng to the Jinan District Court. After several investigations by prosecutors Zhu Weiran and Zhu Fengxiang, a public prosecution was filed. The District Court held a public hearing on the 15th of this month. After the debate concluded, the verdict was announced yesterday (the 19th). Zheng was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for premeditated murder. The full text of the judgment, comprising over 2,500 characters, was transcribed and verified, and released today. It is reported that local groups have prepared to petition the central government for amnesty under the amnesty regulations, granting Zheng a special pardon, so that both law and human sentiment can be considered. I visited Zheng in the court detention center today and asked him what his opinion was on the court's judgment. Zheng said that he had no objections to the judgment, but someone is currently telegraphing the central government to request a special pardon for him. The exchange of telegrams will take some time, and the deadline for appealing the judgment is only ten days, which will be reached in the blink of an eye. He fears that the special pardon will not be granted before the ten-day deadline expires, thus losing the opportunity to appeal. Therefore, he has decided to first appeal to the Shandong High Court, contesting the point of premeditated murder. He has already asked a lawyer to draft the appeal today, and so on. The court's judgment is recorded below for those concerned about this case to browse.</p>
<p>Jinan District Court Criminal First Instance Judgment (21st Year Di Zi No. 141) Defendant Zheng Jicheng, male, age 40, Licheng native, residing at No. 7 Bianzhi Lane, Jinan City. Appointed defense lawyers: Zhou Qingen, Sun Baifu, Li Yunsheng. The right defendant, due to the murder case, was publicly prosecuted by the prosecutor of this court. This court sentences as follows: Main Text: Zheng Jicheng is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for premeditated murder, deprived of civil rights for seven years. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized will be used to offset the sentence at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. Two pistols, twenty-eight bullets, and one bullet head are all confiscated.</p>
<p>Facts: The defendant, Zheng Jicheng, is the stepson of the former Deputy Commander of the Eighth Route Army, Zheng Jinsheng. Because Zheng Jinsheng was murdered by the former Shandong Military Governor Zhang Zongchang in the 16th year of the Republic of China, he held a grudge in his heart. On September 2nd of this year, Zhang Zongchang, along with his bodyguards Liu Huaizhou (i.e., Liu Huaizhou), Liu Qingxun, Xia Tingfang, and others, came to Jinan from Beijing and resided at the Shi Gongguan on Weiyi Road. At 3 p.m. the next day, Zheng Jicheng returned home from the Charity Association and heard that Zhang Zongchang and others would return to Beijing that day. At around 5 p.m., while eating at home, he thought of the old feud and conceived the intention to kill him. He telephoned the Shi Gongguan to inquire and learned that Zhang Zongchang and others had already departed, believing that this was an opportunity not to be missed. Before finishing his meal, he arranged with the fugitive Chen Fengshan, each carrying a pistol. Zheng Jicheng carried twenty-eight bullets, and Fengshan carried six bullets. They took a car to the Shi Gongguan on Weiyi Road, but found the door closed and no car, assuming that Zhang Zongchang and others had indeed gone to the station. They rushed to the Jinpu Railway Jinan Railway Station. At that time, the northbound train was stopped on the third track of the second platform. Zheng Jicheng and Chen Fengshan mingled into the crowd of people seeing them off. Zhang Zongchang came out of the first-class carriage to see off guests. Zheng Jicheng and Chen Fengshan raised their guns to shoot, but the bullets did not fire. Zhang Zongchang caught a glimpse of them and turned to avoid them, jumping down from the east end of the carriage and fleeing northeast. Zheng Jicheng and Chen Fengshan pursued him. Liu Huaizhou and Liu Qingxun rushed to protect him and were shot by Zheng Jicheng and Chen Fengshan, hitting Zhang Zongchang and Liu Huaizhou in vital parts, causing them to fall to the ground and die instantly. Liu Qingxun was also shot and injured. After treatment, he was fortunate enough to survive. Because the station was in chaos at the time, Zheng Jicheng surrendered to the station's law enforcement team of the Third Route Army Headquarters before the military police discovered the crime, requesting to be handed over to the official authorities for judgment. The military court transferred the case to the Shandong Provincial Government, which handed over Zheng Jicheng to this court. The prosecutor completed the investigation and filed a public prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons: The main points of the prosecution's indictment are roughly as follows: After investigating, the defendant, Zheng Jicheng, and the fugitive, Chen Fengshan, harbored resentment for a long time because Zheng Jinsheng was killed by Zhang Zongchang. This time, they carried pistols and took a car to the station to commit the crime, which was premeditated. However, with a single general intent, at the same time and place, committing one act to kill three people, according to Article 42 of the Criminal Law, each constitutes a crime under Article 284, paragraph 1, item 1, and paragraph 2 of the same law, which is equivalent to the provisions of the first part of Article 74 of the same law, and should be punished according to the more serious crime. Furthermore, the defendant surrendered to the law enforcement team before the crime was discovered, which may reduce the penalty for the first crime by one-third. Moreover, the circumstances of the crime are excusable and may be reduced at the discretion of the court in accordance with Article 77 of the same law, and so on.</p>
<p>The main points of the defense are roughly as follows: Premeditated murder requires a long period of preparation and planning. The defendant's intention to kill Zhang Zongchang arose after returning home from the Charity Association to drink alcohol and before 6:10 p.m. when he took a car to the station. The time elapsed from the time when Zheng conceived the intention to avenge his uncle to the time when Zhang was killed was not more than half an hour. The intent to avenge his uncle was only revealed to Chen Fengshan as the car approached the station. Therefore, it cannot be said that it was premeditated murder. Moreover, a bullet was recovered from the body of the deceased Liu Huaizhou, which was definitely not a bullet from the box-type gun carried by the defendant, which is sufficient to prove that Liu Huaizhou and Liu Qingxun were not killed by the defendant. Chen Fengshan accompanied him to the station only for protection. The defendant did not order him to shoot and bombard. Even if the death and injury of Liu Huaizhou and others were the result of Chen Fengshan's crime, the defendant was unaware of this and could not foresee this fact, and should not bear joint criminal responsibility, and so on.

<h3 id="e82">Ministry of Interior Sends Personnel to Inspect the Yellow River <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yingyu Discusses River Management Opinions</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River has been a frequent disaster in recent years, with Shandong and Henan provinces, located at the lower reaches, suffering the most. The Ministry of Interior believes that to fundamentally manage the river, it is necessary to conduct a detailed investigation of the entire river, so it has specially sent Wang Yingyu, a member of the Water Conservancy Commission, to Shandong to first inspect the lowest reaches of the Yellow River where it enters the sea, and then go upstream to inspect the entire river. Wang arrived in Jinan on the 14th, contacted the Shandong River Affairs Bureau on the 15th, and departed from Jinan on the 16th. The River Affairs Bureau sent Pan Yifen, head of the Engineering Section, and Wang Baichen, secretary, to accompany him. Qiang Hanying, president of the Jinan branch of the Engineering Society, also accompanied them. On the morning of the 16th, the group of four traveled by car from Jinan City to Luokou and boarded a boat, going downstream. They stayed overnight in Qinghe Town that night, arrived at Wang Wangzhuang on the 17th, and arrived at Lijin on the 18th. They observed and inquired along the way, with Pan providing explanations and exchanging opinions. They also carefully inspected the shape of the estuary and summoned local elders to inquire about the past water conditions and the gains and losses of defense methods. On the 19th, they returned to Jinan by car from Lijin. That evening, the River Affairs Bureau hosted a public banquet for Wang Yingyu, with Liang Shuming from the Rural Construction Research Institute also attending. It was decided that tomorrow (the 21st) they would take a car from Jinan to inspect Lisherg Dun and other places upstream, following the route into Henan Province, with Pan Yifen and Zhang Hanying accompanying them. Pan will go as far as the Shandong border, while Zhang is scheduled to go to Mengjin for inspection. According to Wang's discussion of the inspection situation and river management opinions, [the relationship between the estuary and the upper reaches is the most important for river management. This inspection of the lower reaches shows that the estuary of Lijin has no bunds to bind it, the water is shallow and the flow is slow, and the scouring force is small, resulting in more and more siltation at the estuary and boundless reeds, which impede the water flow and make breaches most likely. My opinion on the lower reaches is to add dikes until the estuary to bind the river water and to remove the reeds to smooth the water flow. Moreover, according to the locals, historically, there have never been breaches at places where there are stone dams on the entire river, which shows the importance of stone dams. To avoid breaches, the only way is to build stone dams on the entire river. This matter does not seem to be as difficult as imagined in managing the Yellow River, but stone dams cost the most. The government is unable to provide subsidies, and it is not easy for local areas to raise funds. An investigation shows that there are 4 million mu of silted land in Lijin downstream. If immigrants cultivate the land, the minimum income per mu per year is one yuan, which is 4 million yuan a year. If this money is saved to build stone dams, it can be completed in a few years. If the government can provide subsidies, success will be even faster. If immigrants cultivate the land, the most important things are (1) harassment by sea bandits, (2) seawater cannot be drunk, and other drinks must be prepared, and (3) transportation must be planned in advance. In the future, as the water force increases, Tianjin and Yantai will not be far away, steamships can enter the port, and the estuary can become an important town. To regulate the river water, a reservoir lake should be built in the upper reaches, which requires a lot of land, and the people can be moved to the lower reaches to cultivate the land, so they will not lose their jobs. Regarding the middle reaches, in Henan, I once inspected it in a private capacity. The river channel seems to be too wide. In the future, ways can be found to narrow it slightly. However, the greatest harm of the Yellow River lies in carrying sediment. Ways must be found to reduce the sediment. There is a river in the upper reaches of Gansu, Bird and Mouse Mountain, the source of the Wei River, which is blocked by Bird and Mouse Mountain and flows north into the Yellow River. If the river is diverted into the Wei River, the water force of the Yellow River will be smaller, so less sediment will be carried out when it reaches the Hetao area, and more branch canals will be opened in the Hetao area to irrigate the fields, so as to discharge the water force and sediment. Then the sediment in the Yellow River will be less in the future. At the same time, the Wei River will become a clear stream. As it adds tributaries, the water force will naturally be greater. After entering the Yellow River, the force of scouring sediment will also be greater. The silting will be lighter, the water flow will be smoother, and the danger of breaches may be reduced. ] (October 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Kong Hechong's Bandits Disturb Jing'an <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Have Been Dispersed by Luo Lin's Troops</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: According to military sources, after the bandit Kong Hechong fled from the southeast of Hubei Province to the northwest of Jiangxi Province, they initially fiercely attacked Ruichang, Wu'ning, Xiushui, and Tonggu counties. Because the stationed troops were prepared, they were unsuccessful. They then turned to disturb Wanzai, Yichun, Yifeng, and Fenyi. They were also repelled due to the strong defense of the stationed troops. Recently, in order to avoid the strong and attack the weak, the bandits sent the 9th Regiment of the pseudo-16th Army to sneak into Jing'an via Xiushui. According to a letter from Jing'an, at 3 a.m. on the 9th of this month, the county government received an urgent report from the Fourth District Office that more than a thousand bandits had arrived at Xitou. At about 7 a.m., the bandits had fled to Hegang. There were more than a thousand bandits, with four to five hundred guns, two machine guns, and the rest were stretcher teams with carrying poles and ropes. When they first arrived, they first went to the Fox Tail Ridge heights west of the city, and another group fired dozens of shots, swarming into the city and searching and looting separately. They arrested anyone they met. At this time, a reconnaissance plane flew in from the province. The bandits hid in houses or under the eaves. After the plane left, they looted as before. On the morning of the 10th, the bandits transported the looted property, three to four hundred loads, and more than a hundred hostages, to Renci Mountain, five miles from the city. In the morning, a fighter plane also arrived and fired fiercely at the bandits with machine guns at low altitude. The bandits mostly hid in the grass, mountains, forests, eaves, and corners of houses. After three or four hours, the plane flew away, and the bandits came out again to burn and plunder wantonly. That night, the bandits sat in the county government hall and dragged the hostages to be tortured to extort money. Tang Daqing, an alternate member of the Fourth District Party Department, was beheaded and chopped into four pieces. The bandits, having emptied the essence of the county, retreated to the northwest on the 11th. The first security team immediately entered the city and restored order. When the bandits captured Jing'an, the headquarters of the three provinces telegraphed Luo Lin, Yue Sen, Liu Yi, and other troops to surround the bandits in Jing'an. After receiving the order, Luo's troops immediately dispatched Chen Youpeng's regiment to Hegang, Tang's regiment to Nanping Bridge, and another regiment to guard the junction of Xiushui, Wu'ning, Jing'an, and Fengxin, cutting off the bandits' retreat to their old lair. Chen's regiment encountered the bandits in Hegang on the 11th. After several hours of fighting, two hundred bandits were killed, dozens were captured alive, and more than twenty hostages were rescued. The bandits then collapsed from Lion Cliff towards Xiushui. Chen's regiment anticipated that the bandits would detour to Nanping Bridge and took the road to Baisha Bridge to intercept them. On the morning of the 12th, they encountered the bandits again. Chen's regiment fought bravely, and more than half of the bandits were killed or wounded. More than a hundred rifles were seized, and the four hundred loads of property looted by the bandits and more than a hundred hostages were all intercepted. The remnants of the bandits fled towards Madong Zhusha'ao. At this time, Tang's regiment also arrived and joined the search and suppression in Baimao, in order to annihilate the remnants.

<h3 id="e84">Shantou Strictly Prohibits Silver Exports <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Has an Existing Ban</p>
<p>The Customs Administration Actually Issued Passports</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Cracked a Case</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Because it is profitable to export silver dollars to Shanghai, silver exchange shops in this city are willing to destabilize the city's finances and collude with a certain maritime agency to smuggle silver exports. Each thousand yuan can earn a net profit of more than forty yuan, resulting in chaotic finances in the market for several days. Moreover, each silver shop takes advantage of the opportunity of silver shortage (Shantou banknotes cannot be used across borders) when merchants need to borrow interest money from silver shops between autumn and winter to purchase goods from other places, increasing the interest rate and exchange rate. The Shantou Chamber of Commerce is extremely dissatisfied with the heavy exploitation of merchants by silver shops. In order to save finances, it specially convened a meeting on the 17th and resolved to request the government to reiterate the ban on silver exports, and also notified the exchange silver industry and the two guilds to study proper measures to maintain the market. Therefore, the municipal government also issued a notice that each person is only allowed to bring fifty yuan of silver dollars or small coins for export. Those who exceed the limit and export privately minted silver bars will be treated as smuggling, detained and confiscated, and the police team is not allowed to accept bribes and release them. Moreover, the detective team of the Public Security Bureau received a report from an informant yesterday that a Hao firm was privately shipping silver to Shanghai ships, totaling twenty-four boxes, each box containing five thousand yuan. When they were being transferred to barges to be loaded onto the ships, they were seized by the Public Security Bureau. At the same time, the Customs also sent customs officers to investigate. The Public Security Bureau sent additional security teams to supervise. Of the twenty-four boxes, seven boxes were small coins, and those with passports issued by the Customs Supervisory Office were detained by the Customs, and the rest were taken away by the Public Security Bureau. The firms transporting silver exports were: Yun Da, sent two boxes to Chen Yuanda in Shanghai (this firm was opened by Chen Daonan, chairman of the Shantou Chamber of Commerce); Guanghua, sent four boxes to Puyi in Shanghai; Yongli, sent seven boxes to Puyi; Xiexing, sent three boxes to Nanhua in Shanghai; Maoxing, sent five boxes to Jiesheng in Shanghai, and Zhizhi, sent three boxes. There were also shipments to Yitai, Baoda, and Puyi. Among them, those who had already obtained customs passports were: Maoxing three boxes, Yongli two boxes, and Zhizhi three boxes. Each box contained five thousand yuan. After being transported to Shanghai, each box could earn a profit of two hundred yuan. Now that they have been intercepted, they may be confiscated by the government.</p>

<p>Long-Distance and Short-Distance Tests Conducted More Than Twenty Times</p>
<p>Trial Results with Charcoal Burning are Excellent</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Xiang De, a technician of the Hunan Construction Department, and Liu Min, a section chief, have successfully tested coal-powered automobiles after six months of research. On October 11th, representatives specially sent by the four ministries of Industry, Railways, Military Administration, and General Staff, as well as representatives from thirteen provinces including Guizhou, Guizhou, Hubei, Henan, Zhili, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shandong, Gansu, Fujian, and Qinghai, totaling forty-eight people, and foreign guests visiting Hunan, including Mr. and Mrs. An Lide, the American consul in China, and news media including Xu Chen, Yuan Qingming, and a reporter delegation from various Hankou newspapers, and a Hankou bank group, etc., from the 11th to the 15th, successively conducted one long-distance test drive, from Changsha to Yiyang, a round trip of 400 li, taking only five hours, and the results were extremely satisfactory. As for short-distance test drives, there were no less than twenty times. Because the representatives went to various construction agencies, famous scenic spots, and various banquets in the coal-powered automobiles in the past few days, their speed and comfort were comparable to gasoline-powered cars. On the 16th, Pi Zuoqiong, a special representative of the Ministry of Industry, convened representatives from various provinces, experts, and conducted the final long-distance test drive, and made a record as the general result of Hunan Province's trial of coal-powered automobiles. The route</p>

<h3 id="e86">Recent Status of Construction of Five Major Highways in Anhui <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Telegraphed to Expedite Construction of the Wuhu-Tunxi Road</p>
<p>Wuhu-Zhapu Railway Actively Surveying</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In order to facilitate transportation in Anhui Province and meet the needs of military transport, the Anhui Provincial Government has formulated an overall plan to build five major highways: Jingwu (Nanjing to Wuhu), Wutun (Wuhu to Tunxi), Anhe (Anqing to Hefei), Anqiantai (Anqing to Qianshan Taihu), and Xiyu. Among them, the Anhe Road has already started construction or has been opened to traffic in advance, and the Jingwu Road is also being expedited within a time limit. This road is related to the transportation of Jiangsu and Anhui, and it can also connect the Shanghai-Hangzhou route, which is very important. Now 80 to 90% of the entire road project has been completed. Only the bridge project is still being carried out day and night. At the latest, it can be opened to traffic this year or next spring. As for the Wutun Highway, which goes directly from Wuhu to the inland areas of Tunxi and Huizhou, it is tantamount to opening the key to southern Anhui. Until today, those who enter Huizhou from various places still have to follow the land from Wuhu and use cars and sedan chairs instead of walking. Huizhou is mostly mountainous, and it often takes half a month to reach the top and bottom. Moreover, the area borders the Jiangxi border, which is very important for military operations to suppress bandits. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek, commander-in-chief of bandit suppression in the three provinces, is extremely concerned about this line. Recently, he sent a special telegram to the Anhui Provincial Government, instructing Gao Tiejun, the chief county magistrate of Wuhu, to actively recruit workers during the slack season this winter, bring the previously issued survey charts, and go to supervise the construction in person, first dividing the earthwork into sections within a time limit, and limit him to quickly estimate and reply by telegram the unfinished earthwork and number of workers in the county of Wutun Road within three days. After receiving the order, Gao immediately agreed with the survey team and went to the forward to survey and estimate, so as to estimate and reply. At the same time, the Wuzha (Wuhu to Zhapu) light railway initiated by Zhang Jingjiang and others is now also setting up an office in Wu Zhai, Zaoshu Garden, Wuhu, with Chen Hong, two engineering experts, following the Xuanwuguang roadbed and actively surveying, hoping to complete it within two months, so that the bridges and tracks can be valued and handed over to the Shanghai road committee for design. It is said that the cost will be more than 20 million yuan. (October 21st)</p>

<p>County Magistrate Qian and Former Director of Hexiang Bureau Hold Final Accounts</p>
<p>The former director of the Hexiang Administrative Bureau, Zhang Yonglin, had advanced funds while in office, which was denied by the incumbent director, Zhu Guangxiong. The two sides argued and filed numerous official documents, and the case was suspended for several years after being ordered by the provincial department to be audited by the Songjiang County Government, but it has not been concluded. It is now known that the county government ordered the chief of the first district, Zhong Taishi, to invite Zhang Yonglin and Zhu Guangxiong to set a date for auditing, and informed both parties to reply. Subsequently, Zhang Yonglin replied by letter, stating that the other party had repeatedly broken his appointment for setting a date, and the auditing could not be completed. He sent a letter to Chief Zhong to forward it to the county government, requesting a date to be set to avoid the other party making excuses for postponing the meeting, and so on. It has recently been learned that the county government has notified former Director Zhu to set a date for auditing within five days and not to postpone it any further. At the same time, Chief Zhong was ordered to send a letter to both parties to urge them to complete the auditing within a time limit.</p>

<p>Zhongda Street in Kunshan is a prosperous commercial area. At 4:00 PM on the 21st, Zhang Daquan's foreign goods store accidentally caused a fire while repairing an air-pressure stove. The fire spread to the stored kerosene, making it uncontrollable. When the fire brigades from various districts heard the alarm, they rushed to the scene to put out the fire. However, the fire had already spread to the Zhu Xingtai tin foil shop across the street. Due to the large amount of Texaco kerosene stored in the shop, the fire intensified. It was not until 7:00 PM that the fire was extinguished. Several businesses were burned down, including Erxi Sanfang Bookstore, Bao Cheng Jewelry Store, and Yongli Shoe and Hat Store, with losses amounting to more than 100,000 yuan. When the fire broke out, a clerk from Zhang Daquan's store was burned and rescued by people. He was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are serious and he may not survive.</p>

<p>Since its completion, the Xicheng Highway has stretched for more than 90 li, connecting the traffic of the two counties and benefiting long-distance bus passengers. However, the northern section of the road only extended to the West Gate of Jiangyin and failed to reach the Jiangyin Pier. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction recently instructed the Jiangyin County Bureau of Construction to immediately extend the route to connect to the Yangtze River pier. After receiving the order, the bureau has dispatched personnel to survey the route, which is estimated to be about six li long. It is said that construction will begin soon.</p>

<p>Recently, lake bandits have been rampant. Although the police team has fiercely suppressed them, they scatter and flee, making it difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. The day before yesterday, Zhang Guifang, the tenth team leader of the second district of the water police, was ordered to hire two lake boats at Xincunkou. He led 50 water police officers stationed in the mountains to Zhushan. They happened to meet Captain Sun of the ninth team, who also led 40 police officers on two lake boats to search various small mountains. Finding nothing, they patrolled the Jiaoshan and Tuoshan areas. The northwest wind picked up, and the large fishing boats all sailed to the South Lake. The bandit ships also took the opportunity to escape, resulting in no gains.</p>

<p>Patrol Officer Privately Releases Opium Offender, Subject to Investigation</p>
<p>Sheng A-quan and Sheng Changhong, who run a teahouse, and Jin Zhitang, a storyteller at the teahouse, were found to be privately smoking opium in Shengjialang Xiatang in the northern countryside of Jiaxing. The news was reported to the Langxia Police Station, and Patrol Officer Dai Boshu immediately ordered Police Chief Li Yaoting, Patrol Officer Li Jinsheng, and Xu Changde to search the premises. Thirteen sets of opium smoking paraphernalia were found, and Sheng A-quan, Sheng Changhong, and Jin Zhitang were arrested. After a brief interrogation by Patrol Officer Dai, they were detained. That night, Sheng Xin-yi, the village chief of Meihu Township, and several teachers from Meihu Elementary School went to intercede. After several discussions with Patrol Officer Dai, the suspects were not released. The next day, they hired a boat to escort the opium offenders to the Wangjiangjing Third Sub-bureau. When the boat reached the north gate of Wangjiangjing, a small boat suddenly approached and swapped Ru Jinsheng, a beggar on the small boat, with Sheng A-quan from Patrol Officer Dai's boat. When the case was brought to the sub-bureau, Chief Ting Zhichun asked questions and found suspicious points. He then strictly investigated the matter and found out the truth. He asked the county bureau chief for instructions and was ordered to send the patrol officer to Jiaxing for investigation.

<p>To the Editor: After reviewing the "Important News" column on page 2 of your newspaper on October 17, we found the statement "60-70% of the shops were burned" in the report "Two Disasters in Datong". This is inconsistent with the facts. Here is a brief account of the actual fire incident on that day. At 10:30 PM on the 13th of this month, a thatched house belonging to the Jiang family on the Hengdi in Zhoutou caught fire due to carelessness. At that time, the southeast wind was very strong, and hundreds of thatched houses on the embankment were burned down. Then, the wind suddenly turned northeast, causing the thatched houses outside the embankment along the river to be burned as well. Before long, the wind changed to due east and then burned westward, burning down about 800 houses, covering an area of about 300 mu. There were about 4,000 disaster victims, all of whom were laborers. It was an unprecedented disaster, too tragic to bear. Fortunately, it was still far from the city of Datong, and no shops were burned. In accordance with the facts, we hereby send this letter with the hope that your newspaper will investigate and promptly correct the error, and we will be very grateful. Wang Daolong, Chairman of the Datong Oil, Sugar and Paper Industry Association, October 20.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Preliminary Suggestions for Reforming Chinese School Education <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>(12) Cheng Tianfang</p>
<p>How should a political university be run? Absolutely not many political universities should be set up. One or two in the whole country is enough. The political university should have internal affairs, finance, transportation, justice, education, police administration, land, surveying and other subjects. High school graduates should be enrolled and given five years of training. The political university should focus on academic research on the one hand, and pay special attention to the cultivation of personality, the practice of group life, and the development of management ability on the other. Nowadays, people engaged in politics in China have too strong a sense of selfishness and too weak a sense of responsibility. Therefore, the phenomena of greed, corruption, procrastination, perfunctoriness, infighting, and exclusion are fully exposed in the political arena. How can politics not be corrupt and the country not be refined? If we want to reform politics, we must first change the atmosphere. If we want to change the atmosphere, we must first cultivate talents who can change the atmosphere. This mission is what the political university should shoulder. Therefore, the political university should pay special attention to cultivating students' brave, sacrificial, honest, and pure character, orderly and methodical management ability, harmonious cooperation, and spirit of solidarity in abiding by the law and obeying public opinion. Anyone who shows shortcomings in these areas, even if their academic performance is excellent, will have to be reluctantly let go.</p>
<p>All expenses of political university students while they are in school are provided by the government, but after graduation, their intelligence and ability should be completely dedicated to the country and be subject to the country's command. The government should consider the subjects they have studied and the nature of their skills, and assign them to serve in local or central government agencies. Initially, they should all be given the title of trainee and paid the minimum salary. After the training period expires, they should be promoted level by level according to their performance. After a considerable period of assessment, if they are indeed capable, have an upright character, and are not affected by customs and able to change the atmosphere, then they should be given heavy responsibilities, such as county magistrate. Of course, even if the political university implements extremely strict training, no one can guarantee that everyone who comes out of it will become a political talent. However, assuming that several hundred students graduate from the political university every year, and after training, dozens of them become good county magistrates, and dozens of them become good secretaries and section chiefs (as long as it is done well, this is probably not difficult), then after ten or twenty years, the political atmosphere will surely change, and the goal of reforming politics will not be difficult to achieve, and the political university will have fulfilled its purpose.</p>
<p>Since political universities are established separately, the political and legal departments of other national universities can be merged into the political university. As for private universities, they can be allowed to train professional talents such as lawyers and accountants to serve the society, but the important task of cultivating political leaders cannot be placed in their hands. Some people may say that Chinese people have always had a particularly strong desire to become officials, so there are particularly many and well-developed private law schools and political science schools. If the state runs a political university and guarantees employment after graduation, wouldn't it further promote the idea of becoming an official? I think it is still true that Chinese people have a strong desire to become officials, but there are other reasons for the large number of private law schools and political science schools and the high number of students. First, law departments are easy to run, unlike engineering, agriculture, science, etc., which require large amounts of equipment costs, so private schools mostly run law departments. Second, private schools mostly accept all students who come, so students who originally did not want to enter law departments can only enter private law schools or political science schools because they cannot get into other schools. We only need to look at the fact that only 114 people applied for the political science department of National Zhejiang University this year, while about 200 people applied for the electrical engineering department, to see that most high school graduates do not want to study political science anymore. As for the reason why the idea of becoming an official is so strong, it is because the power of officials is too great, which attracts a group of people to envy them. If the government reduces the power of officials and increases their responsibilities, the concept can be changed immediately. For example, although students of the political university receive special treatment from the government while they are in school and are employed by the government after graduation, it seems like special preferential treatment, but their freedom is dedicated to the country. They cannot refuse if the government sends them to serve in remote provinces or poor areas, and they cannot refuse if the government gives them the minimum salary. On the other hand, if an engineering university graduate has strong ability and good opportunities, he may be able to earn a salary of more than 100 yuan immediately after graduation. In terms of personal life, he is much freer and more comfortable than a political university graduate. Therefore, in this way, people who do not have a particularly strong sense of service and a strong sense of responsibility may not want to enter the political university, so how can it promote the idea of becoming an official?</p>

<p>Summary of Speeches: (1) Chairman Zhang Zhongdao reported that the city occupies a very important position in the country due to the development of industry and commerce and the large population. Therefore, the city's education should be actively expanded to meet the needs of the environment, especially paying attention to the development of social education in addition to school education. The colleagues of this association will contribute all their energy and experience to the educational administrative organs, in order to expect the development of the city's entire education. (2) Zhou Lianze, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, said that education is a kind of political facility. Our Party takes the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle for saving the country. Therefore, all educational facilities should be carried out in accordance with the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. I hope that all the colleagues of the Municipal Education Association can uphold this essential meaning and help promote the development of the city's education. (3) Zeng Shengdian, representative of the Mayor, said that the board of directors and supervisors produced by the Municipal Education Association is the crystallization of talents from elementary, middle and high schools in the city. In the future, it will surely provide great help to the city's educational administrative agencies. However, I believe that the decline of China's national fortune today is due to the decline of production undertakings. Therefore, I very much hope that you will devote yourself to the research of production education, so that production undertakings can be developed. Wang Jichuan and other guests also gave speeches, and the length of the speeches is omitted. Finally, Zheng Hongnian, a representative of the directors and supervisors, gave a speech on behalf of all the directors and supervisors. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Donghua Overcomes French Business</p>
<p>Chen Jiaqiu and Li Yichen Each Score a Goal</p>
<p>The French Business Team Put On a Wonderful Performance</p>
<p>Separated for three days, one must look at them with new eyes. Yesterday's wonderful performance by the French Business team on the baseball field was truly astonishing. Fortunately, Donghua had the defense of a golden city and iron wall, and the sharp and agile warriors in attack, and finally won two goals from the strong and capable opponents, and returned in triumph.</p>
<p>No Way for Heroes to Approach the Goal</p>
<p>For a time, it was rumored that the famous Scottish referee Davidson was officiating his first match in Shanghai in the Donghua vs. French Business game yesterday. At the sound of three whistles, the battle began. Donghua seized the initiative, dividing its forces to attack. Wan Xianghua stood up, and the ball moved from the left to the center, turning into a corner kick. Wu Youliang saw the opportunity and shot, from more than twenty yards away, hitting the upper goalpost and bouncing backward. Chen Yutian received the ball and moved from the right to the center, shooting at the goal. The shot was blocked. For a time, the brave generals surrounded the enemy's goal, each displaying their skills. The enemy's pillar, Ma Er, strong and powerful, snatched the ball and escaped danger.</p>
<p>One Goal Shakes All in Attendance</p>
<p>The French Business wave had just passed, and they led the crowd to invade. Feng Tu and Wu resisted in front, and Li Guan assisted behind. Zhou Xianyan had no chance to be a hero. At twenty-five minutes, Donghua increased the pressure, turning into a corner kick. Wan Xianghua passed the ball well, and Li Yichen rushed in fiercely. The goalkeeper was startled. Chen Jiaqiu landed a kick, breaking the goal. As soon as one goal was scored, all in attendance were greatly shaken.</p>
<p>The Enemy General Labors in Vain</p>
<p>French Business, losing a goal, was not discouraged at all. They still advanced whenever they had the opportunity, entering every space. However, their skills were lacking, and their luck was not good. Until the first half, they were at a disadvantage with a score of zero to one. In the second half, their spirits were uplifted, and they fought hard. The three players in the center were particularly good, and the two wings were still acceptable, but the entire line could not form a cohesive whole and use each other. Therefore, in extremely good situations, Donghua was always seen breaking through the encirclement and escaping danger, unable to achieve its ultimate goal, which was due to each acting on their own. About ten minutes later, Fa Fanqie of Right Wing almost scored a goal, but his forearm touched the ball before kicking it, so it was invalid even though it went in. He labored in vain.</p>
<p>The Header Skill is Amazing</p>
<p>After this, Donghua encountered a second danger. French Business had the opportunity to take a free kick, which was just outside the penalty area. Inner defender Marseille, at the request of the whole team, personally stepped forward. Fa Fanqie missed the direction, but it was seized by Donghua. The crowd was pleased, but due to a miscommunication of the signal, they gained nothing. Instead, Wan hooked the ball from the baseline, and Chen Jiaqiu rushed up with a kick but missed. Wan passed it again, and Chen Hongguang followed closely. The defender left the goal to make an emergency save. The ball suddenly veered to the right. Chen Yutian saw it, and the ball was falling right in front of him. He rushed forward, but suddenly a rescuer came diagonally, and Chen was blocked by him, unable to fulfill his ambition. After that, Chen kicked a corner kick, which was perfectly placed. Li Yichen jumped out of the crowd and headed the ball in. With two goals already scored, the situation was set. Donghua, in a balanced situation, shifted and took the upper hand. The forwards continued to press, gaining a great advantage. French Business resisted with all their might, and nothing happened. They hit the goalpost twice, which should be considered fortunate. Finally, Zhou Xianyan caught Fa Fanqie's ball in the air, which was greatly praised by the whole field. In the end, Donghua won 2-0.</p>

<p>Shanghai Team Has the Advantage</p>
<p>Singles: Zheng Jia Zhao Defeats Fen Qiao</p>
<p>Doubles: Hui Ka vs. Luo Brothers Tie</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd - Today was the first day of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Inter-Port Tennis Tournament. The weather was very good, with a slight breeze. As a result, Shanghai won the first point. In singles, Zheng Jia Zhao, a rising young player from Shanghai, defeated Fen Qiao, a strong player from Hong Kong, 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1. In doubles, Hui Te, Kanavalo, and the Luo Wenhui brothers from Hong Kong each won two sets. It was getting dark, and the match will continue at 10 a.m. tomorrow. The result was 6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-4.</p>
<h3 id="e117">The Singles Match <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Zheng Zhao Jia (Shanghai) (2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1) Fen Qiao (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>Both sides appeared nervous at the start, but Fen Qiao gradually calmed down, while Zheng made repeated serving errors. Fen Qiao won the first set 6-2. In the second set, Fen took a 3-0 lead, winning with an overhead smash. But Zheng then showed his real skill, winning six consecutive games. In the third set, Fen again took a 4-2 lead, but Zheng won four consecutive games. In the fourth set, Zheng took a 2-0 lead, approaching the net to volley, but Fen shot to his left and right, winning 6-3 to tie the sets at 2-2. In the final set, Fen Qiao was completely defeated and could not recover, with wild shots all over the court. Zheng won a big victory 6-1.</p>
<h3 id="e118">The Doubles Match <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Hui Te Kanavalo (Shanghai) (6-4, 5-7, 3-6, 6-4) Luo Wenhui Brothers (Hong Kong)</p>
<p>The Shanghai team started smoothly, with Hui Te's serve and smash overwhelming the Luo Wenhui brothers. The two Luo's usual cooperation completely fell apart. The Shanghai team won the first set 6-4. The second set was fiercely contested. The Shanghai team took a 2-0 lead, but due to overconfidence and carelessness, they lost 5-7. In the third set, the two Luo brothers launched a perfect coordinated attack, with many long rallies and equal scores. The two Luos won again 6-3. In the fourth set, both sides played very well, but Kanavalo made many errors, and Hui Te was too eager to win, gradually showing fatigue. As a result, Shanghai won 6-4. The decisive fifth set will be played at 10 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Central Youth Women's Volleyball Finals <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Wuben Wins the Championship</p>
<p>3-1 Overwhelms Haixing</p>
<p>The Skills are Truly Worthy of Praise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Wuben Women's Volleyball Team, with their exquisite skills, once again overwhelmed their strong opponent, the Haixing Team, to win the championship of the Central Youth First Women's Volleyball League. The result was 3-1, with scores of 21-12, 21-17, 24-26, 21-12.</p>
<p>Wuben is Ineffable Wuben's volleyball skills are superb and flawless. The sophistication of their cooperation and the smoothness of their coordination are beyond description; one can only call it ineffable. The talent is balanced, and each player excels in their role. The spikes of Zhang, Li, and Wang in the front row are capable of surprise attacks, catching people off guard, especially Zhang Biru's ruthless methods, which leave people helpless. Xue Zhijie, sitting in the center, is highly skilled and hardworking in setting up the ball from the back row. The championship is well-deserved.</p>
<p>Haixing is Slightly Inferior In terms of individual technique, Haixing is definitely not inferior to Wuben. The reason for their loss is poor coordination and uneven talent. The fierce players are a cut above, while the weak players are too weak. The talent is scattered, and there is no way to train together. The most outstanding players on the team are Wang Chunruo, Su Zuqi, and Huang Xingfen, followed by Guan Liuzhu. The rest make frequent errors, and their positions are disorganized. The back row moves too far forward, sometimes squeezing each other, which Wuben took advantage of. It's a pity.</p>
<p>Two Consecutive Sets In the first attack, Haixing was frustrated by Wuben 5-1. Wuben chased closely, and the score was very close, 5-5, and then Wuben won the half-set first at 11-9. Xue Zhijie added four points in a row, and the situation changed. 15-9, 18-11. Li Po made it 21-12, and Wuben won the first set. In the second set, Haixing still found it difficult to develop, and again lost the half-set first at 7-11, falling behind 16-9. At this time, Huang Xingfen suddenly added three points, giving Haixing hope of a turnaround. But at this time, Xue Zhijie made repeated mistakes, and Haixing was only two points behind at 17-19. Unfortunately, Wuben still won this second set 21-17.</p>
<p>Haixing Begins to Fight Hard Under adverse circumstances, Haixing began to fight hard. In the third set, Haixing, although trailing by two points at 3-5, Su Zuqi added three points in a row to lead 6-5. Wang Xiangying also led 10-9. Unexpectedly, in this good opportunity, Xingfen and Zuzhen collided. Next, Wuben, after a kill by Li Po, still won the half-set first at 11-10. The scores of the two teams after that were sometimes only one point apart, difficult to resolve, and the whole audience was tense. Wuben won a point at 20-19, and after a kill by Su Zuqi, it was equal again. After each scoring 24 points, Haixing took a gamble and won back the third set 26-24.</p>
<p>Wuben Wins the Championship Haixing won back one set, posing a great threat to Wuben. Sure enough, 6-3, 9-6, 10-9, victory after victory. Unexpectedly, when it was Wuben's turn to serve, Zhang Jia Sui scored seven points in a row, which became a fatal blow to Haixing. 17-12. Finally, in the fourth set at 21-12, Wuben won a total of 3-1. The warriors of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Wuben A</p>
<p>Front Row Middle Row Back Row</p>
<p>Li Po Qian Shuyi Xiao Jieying</p>
<p>Zhang Biru Xue Zhijie Wang Jinfeng</p>
<p>Wang Xuehua Lu Meiyun Zhang Jiasui</p>

<p>Dai Zuling Huang Xingfen Guan Yanjiao</p>
<p>Wang Chunruo Su Zuqi Guo Xiaoping</p>
<p>Wang Xiangying Guan Liuzhu Yin Linzhen</p>
<p>Ying Mengdie (Fourth Set)</p>
<p>Team Results</p>
<p>Team Name Games Played Wins Losses Percentage</p>
<p>Wuben A Five Times Five Times 0 Times 1.000</p>
<p>Haixing Five Times Four Times One Time 0.800</p>
<p>Two A Five Times Three Times Two Times 0.600</p>
<p>Wuben B Five Times Two Times Three Times 0.400</p>
<p>Chenxi Five Times One Time Four Times 0.200</p>
<p>Guoguang Five Times 0 Times Five Times 0.000</p>
<p>There were two other group matches yesterday, and the results are as follows: (1) Wuben B wins against Guoguang, Guoguang forfeits; (2) Two A wins against Chenxi, 21-11, 21-12, 21-11, for a total of 3-0.</p>
<p>Haixing Prepares for Revenge Although Haixing failed to Wuben again, it is said that Haixing will not be discouraged by this, and will continue to work hard, endure hardship, and strive for revenge. May Haixing encourage itself.</p>
<p>The Record Almost Became a Big Mistake Yesterday, in the match between Chinese and Chinese, not a single spectator was a foreigner. The referee should never use a foreign language. Because, unlike other matches, the difficulty of changing to Chinese is only the score. This is an extremely obvious fact. Because English was used, in the third set, Wuben was actually leading 15-12, and the next score should have been 15-13, but it was reported as 15-14. This kind of error, because it is an official record, cannot be corrected, and as a result, it creates a situation where Wuben fails, and the relationship between the outcomes is too great. Moreover, the poor order in the venue, the bad phenomenon of strange noises and stamping feet, is even more inappropriate in the Central Youth venue. I hope the authorities will pay attention to it.</p>

<p>Result is a Score of Two to One</p>
<p>The First Half was Two to Zero</p>
<p>The Western Capture team, which is unanimously called the only strong team in the Western Union Football Club, and the mediocre Lancashire team, actually played an unexpected match. The two teams clashed at the racetrack yesterday, and as a result, Western Capture was defeated by Lancashire with a score of one to two. Moreover, in the first half, Western Capture was under pressure and lost two goals in a row. Although they tried to retaliate in the second half, they only scored one goal. In the end, the total number of three goals was used to determine the outcome. Western Capture's reputation cannot avoid being tainted.</p>

<p>To apply this formation, there must be a tall center and three agile teammates, and they must all be able to catch the ball steadily, so that the game can be played smoothly and cooperatively. This method is commonly seen in the American [Ten University Games]. Number four pretends to rush to the free throw line, then turns to the right of his opponent's guard and passes the ball to number two, who is rushing out of the corner. After receiving the ball, number two dribbles into the arc of the free throw area. At this time, number two's guard is temporarily blocked by number four. The tall center, number one, should rush out of the corner and catch number two's pass at the free throw line. After catching the ball, he (number one) turns slightly and passes it back to number two. At this time, number three has run straight to the basket along the sideline. Number two then passes the ball to him (number three) to let him shoot.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Financial and Gold Markets See Further Gains <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Supply and Demand Differ, but the Process is Peaceful Yesterday, the gold price rose frequently and continuously, and the trend was generally stable. The supply and demand from all parties differed, but Hengxing continued to purchase, and speculators and hedgers were not as brave as the previous day. At most, they hovered around two taels in the morning and afternoon. Afterwards, it rose again by one tael and seven qian compared to yesterday's closing price. The opening was mediocre. Although the silver market fell, it did not see much excitement, which was likely due to the pre-emptive price hike on the previous day. Eventually, because there seemed to be more sellers, there was an immediate setback, falling to 40 taels and 8 qian. Foreign exchange was nominally tight but effectively flat. However, the Guangbang and various firms showed strong buying interest, leading to a favorable situation, and reaching a high point of 745 taels and 1 qian. The afternoon closing was slightly weaker, hovering around 44 taels. All of the November contracts, which had been swapped by Yingfengheng with Tongtaichang, Yuanxing, Yongruikang, and others, amounting to several hundred contracts, were trading at a premium of 5 taels and 7 qian 5 fen. There was no news of spot transactions by the Central Bank. Due to the Saturday market closure, the situation in the morning market is as follows:</p>
<p>Weakness in the Morning Turns into Expansion Later From the opening of the December contract, there was a slight increase of 3 qian, to 742 taels and 8 qian (before the opening, goods were traded at 43-44 taels). The silver price fell back, and the base was stable, so people's hearts were not firm. For a moment, Qianchangxiang, Yifeng, Yongwanxing, Bingxing, and others were all selling, standing at 1 tael, for 41 taels and 7 qian. The buyers were also numerous, adding 1 tael and a half in an instant. However, the situation was hesitant. Daxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Yifeng, Yongfutai, Hengheng, Yufu, Fuchang, and others were selling relentlessly, depreciating by more than 2 taels in a flash, falling to 40 taels and 8 qian around 9:10 am. Before long, Hengxing entered the market to buy, and Yingfengheng, Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Yuanmao, Yongdaxing, Yongyuantai, Dadecheng, Zhaofengchang, and others competed to advance, jumping more than 3 taels. Presumably, there were still many seeking to close US dollar positions. The December contract was at 30 yuan 0125, January 25, then only 1875, December 0625. The British pound contract was trading at 1925 for December. The market situation looked good, and at 9:30 am it was 44 taels and a half. HSBC listed its prices, and the British and American rates each contracted by 125. Afterwards, Bingxing, Fuyu, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Hengyu, Qingfa, Yongzhenchangxiang, and others all came to sell, and the December US dollar was available at 125, falling back to 42 taels by 10:00 am. Afterwards, there were differing accounts from various parties, and foreign exchange was flat. The gold price was estimated to have an underlying increase of 1 tael and 6-7 qian. Until after 10:30 am, the buyers were active, including Bingxing, Yuanxing, Yong, and others making slight advances, reaching 43 taels by 11:00 am. Then it stabilized. After 11:30 am, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongdadecheng, goods, and others continued to buy, adding 2 taels, reaching 45 taels and 1 qian at 11:45 am. However, Fuchang, Zhifengyong, Yongdaxingyong, and others were selling off, immediately falling back 1 tael and 1 qian, reaching 44 taels. By the afternoon closing, it was 44 taels and 2 qian, up 1 tael and 7 qian compared to the sixth day before. Based on the half-day maximum of 45 taels and 1 qian and the minimum of 40 taels and 8 qian, there was a difference of 4 taels and 3 qian. The net short position was estimated to be 13 taels and 7 qian 5 fen.</p>
<p>Posted Prices Were Mostly Suppressed by 2 Taels The posted price for the US dollar was lowered by 125 to 29 yuan 75, which was then changed to 806 taels, pressing by 61 taels to 64 taels, then to 62 taels, pressing by 2 taels more than the previous day. The account for this month was 47 taels, the next month 46 taels, December 44 taels, and the premium 47 taels.</p>
<p>The Transactions of Various Firms Seemed Sluggish Trading on the surface was normal. In total, Guangbang Hengxing continued to purchase more than 2,000 contracts, and the majority were adding to long positions. At present, they have a total of more than 6,000. Hengyu, Dadecheng, Yuanmaomao, Yuhuo, Huixiang, and Shenyu, as well as small retail accounts making quick profits, were busy with transactions. Yingfengheng, Shenkang, Yongfeng, Zhifengyong, and Yuantai were all buying, while Wanxing, Yifengshui, Zhaofengchang, Qianchangxiang, Yuanxingyong, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Futaiheng, Daxingyong, Ruixing, and others were all selling positions. The rest was complicated. The Dalian group sold approximately 400 contracts in total, and purchased more than 100 contracts. The total number of contracts held by various firms as of the day before yesterday was approximately 19,300, a decrease from before, as both the long and short sides were mutually flattening positions.</p>
<h3 id="e124">The Exchange Market Was Nominally Tight but Effectively Flat <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market reported a drop in both near and forward periods. The exchange rate was flat for British pounds, and slightly smaller for US dollars, with the HSBC listing reducing by half a grade, with British and American currencies each decreasing by 125. Hong Kong still showed signs of having transactions but no market, and the rest showed a consistent downward trend. However, there were no major changes in the domestic market. The British pound initially widened and then flattened, and the US dollar was flat and then better. However, the results were no different from the previous day, which can be described as a nominally tight but effectively flat situation. Trading was still normal, a completely different scenario from the previous day. Presumably, the gold market rose slightly, and there were profits to be made from hedging, so they bought back. Guangbang Hengxing Shenda and others continued to buy back more than 200,000 yuan, which were one-sided transactions. Chinese banks and silver companies all sold, while foreign banks rarely made transactions. Due to the Saturday market closure, there would be no market in the coming day.</p>
<p>British Exchange The domestic market fluctuated only by 0625 during the half-day. The selling price in the near market was initially 1 shilling 9 pence 1875, the forward price was 3125, and the buying price was 25 to 375. An Da sold and Huabi bought December 25. Shanghai Zhongfu traded December 3125 with January. The afternoon closing selling price was 125 to 25, and the buying price was 1875 to 3125.</p>
<p>American Exchange The domestic market had a fluctuation of 125 in the morning. The selling price for this month in the morning market was 30 yuan, November 0625, December 125, and January 1875. The buying price for each month was increased by 125. Pangen offered January 25, the silver company offered December 125, and Huabi also offered the same price. Zhongfu offered January 1875, Huabi offered December 0625, the silver company and An Da offered 0625 to 125, and another offered 1875. The afternoon closing was still flat, similar to the morning opening.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Near-Term Large Bars Fell Slightly <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 22nd - The closing price for near-term large bars was 17 pence 6875, a decrease of 0625. The forward price remained at 17 pence 8125. The British-American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan 39 and 1875.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the regular Saturday, banks were closed in the afternoon, and the market was thus sparse. The interbank call rate in the market was 7 qian and 07 li and 7 hao and a half in the morning market, and 7 qian and 07 li and 2 hao and a half in the afternoon market, a slight decrease of half a li between the two markets. The situation was generally soft, and transactions were made. The remittance of money orders was 535,000 in the morning market and 540,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 15,000 in the morning market and 30,000 in the afternoon market. Off-exchange banknotes were 80,000 in the morning market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. Checks were 40,000 in the morning market and 20,000 in the afternoon market. The interbank transaction volume was 600,000 in the morning market and 500,000 in the afternoon market. The silver call loan rate in both morning and afternoon markets remained at 3 fen, with a premium of approximately 1 qian on transfers. More than 1.1 million foreign exchange dealings were settled between banks, with banknote inflows and outflows of more than 1.5 million. Chinese merchants settled more than 1.5 million in money orders, and foreign merchants settled more than 1.2 million in money orders.

<p>丨Excellent Market Conditions, Volume Exceeds Five Million丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange and the futures market suddenly became active again. Both buyers and sellers were actively trading in both the morning and afternoon sessions, and the market atmosphere was far better than the previous day. The trading volume was over 2.8 million in the morning session and over 2.2 million in the afternoon session, totaling 5,075,000 yuan. Among them, the Salt Tax bonds accounted for over 900,000 yuan, the Unified Tax 20 Series Disbandment Bonds and the Troop Reduction Bonds each accounted for about 700,000 yuan, and the 20 Customs Reorganization 19 Customs Improvement Bonds each accounted for 4-500,000 yuan. However, other bonds were still relatively quiet. The spot market was still very deserted, with only 6,000 yuan traded for the 19 Customs and 20 Customs bonds in the afternoon, and no other transactions. As for the trend of various bonds, as a result of the continuous rise in recent days, short sellers suddenly sold off smoothly yesterday, resulting in a consistent drop in prices compared to the previous day. However, the overall market environment for bonds remained calm. Although prices were weak, the trend hovered, and the fluctuations were minimal, resulting in a decrease of about three to four cents compared to the previous day. This was mainly because the market transactions were mostly for hedging, and the supply and demand situation was balanced.</p>

<p>A report from the Sincere Trading Company stated that the New York stock market was unusually weak on Friday. There was a lack of buyers and a constant supply of sellers. Prices of all stocks plummeted across the board. There were several rebounds, but the momentum was insufficient and ultimately failed. The total trading volume for the day was 1.2 million shares. The closing prices were as follows: Allied Chemical and Dye 70.5 (unit: dollar), American Can 49.5, American Tobacco 62.5, Bethlehem Steel 17, Canadian Pacific Railway 13.5, Chrysler Motors 13.5, National Fuel Gas 3, Eastman Kodak 5, Electric Bond and Share 22.25, International Nickel 8, Kennecott Copper 10.5, Citibank 43.5, New York Central Railroad 22, North American Utility 28, Packard Motors 3, Radio Corporation of America 7, Paramount Pictures 3.5, Union Pacific Railroad 63, United States Steel 35.

<p>The cotton yarn market is calm and uneventful. Trading in the market is relatively quiet, with both buyers and sellers adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The market situation has become deadlocked again. The sales of spot yarn by out-of-town merchants have become increasingly sluggish. All parties lack vitality, and the future situation lacks certainty.</p>
<p>The human marker is utterly uninteresting. At the opening of the human marker, the atmosphere in the market was listless due to a slight drop in American cotton, and there were not many transactions. The prices of all months fell slightly by one or two cents. In the afternoon, they fell again by one or two cents. The total trading volume for the day was 8,700 bales. It was found that 500 bales of Mingde, 300 bales of Changfeng, 400 bales of Yu, 350 bales of Tianjiang were sold, and 400 bales of Heshen, 650 bales of Huachang, 350 bales of Shenji, 500 bales of Dafeng, and 350 bales of Yichang were bought.

<p>The cotton market is calm, with both rises and falls. However, there are only three days left until the delivery date for the October standard cotton, and although a certain manufacturer has a large amount of goods to deliver, it is said that there are about 40,000 piculs. More than 20,000 piculs have already been inspected and合格, and half are still pending. A decision will be made after further evaluation this afternoon. The attitudes of both buyers and sellers are unusually serious. Yesterday's appraisal committee determined that the grade of Jiujiang cotton was only 3 taels and 2.5 mace. As for the seller, although there is a huge amount of delivery, they also show signs of being exhausted.</p>
<p>The Zheng Marker trend is relatively stable. At the opening of the Zheng Marker, the market atmosphere in the near months showed signs of being uneven, but the far months were firmer, rising by 0.5 to 1 cent. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was higher, and each month rose by 0.5 to 1 cent. The total trading volume for the day was 39,800 piculs. It was found that 2,500 piculs of Mingde, 2,800 piculs of Yichang, 3,000 piculs of Yuanda, 1,400 piculs of Suilong, and 1,200 piculs of Jifeng were sold, and 2,000 piculs of Heshen, 2,400 piculs of Hengyi, 3,200 piculs of Tongxing, 2,300 piculs of Yifeng, and 1,500 piculs of Dafeng were bought.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to Southern hedging sales, then rebounded due to buying by traders, and finally softened again due to the weakness of Wall Street. The futures fell by 4 to 9 pounds, and the spot fell by 5 pounds. Both British cotton futures and spot fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 17 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly with American cotton, but later rebounded due to buying by Japanese merchants. Pingguoer rose by 1 rupee, Aomula rose by 0.5 rupee, and Bailuoxi rose by 0.25 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 21st):</p>

<p>丨Southern Hedging Sales Are Very Active丨</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 21st reports on the cotton market during the week, stating that an increase in hedging sales led to buying by traders, but only when prices fell. As a result, the cotton market slightly declined last week. Most of the transactions were limited by domestic political situation and waiting for the development of the spot market. The Southern hoarding movement continues, and some people want to replenish their October futures contracts, so they have to pay the highest basis price of the season. The market changes are due to reorganization, and the difference between the market prices in New York and Liverpool is used to maintain the fluctuations of the gold pound exchange rate. Cotton production is extremely difficult to estimate, although some believe that production will be revised downwards. The amount of hedging sales and its attraction are currently valued by people. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>Hunan There are more than 150 rice boats in the pond, so the arrival of goods has been limited recently. Today, counterparts from Wujiang Tongli and other places came to Shanghai to meet with the leaders of the Shanghai firms and invited the municipal government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Chamber of Commerce to mediate satisfactorily. As a result, the situation has eased, and wild rice and white rice have fallen sharply by five to six cents. Xixin japonica rice has also followed by a small two or three cents. Kiln-grown Baige Duyangjian has each fallen by two cents.</p>
<p>Xinzha Today, more than 40 ships arrived, and the situation has been on a downward spiral. The transactions between urban and rural stores and merchants are quite small. The opening prices of japonica rice from Kunshan, Yixing, Suzhou, and other places have each fallen by three to four cents. Kiln-grown Baige has fallen by a short two or three cents. The Changxi merchants are neither happy nor sad in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Flour Market Greatly Weakened in the Afternoon <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of each month were generally stable. Because the quotation of foreign wheat improved by about 10 cents, most of the large and small factories waited and watched, and there were not many transactions. People's minds gradually stabilized, and the distant months seemed to be 0.5 to 0.75 cents better than the previous day. When it opened in the afternoon, it was initially stable, but then it fell again, because it was rumored that the pricing of Australian wheat was also cheap, only 3.6 taels, and Japanese merchants were directly dumping foreign flour to Tianjin, it was heard that it was only 1.7 taels. The Yufeng was also dumping in the distant months, so people's minds were greatly weakened, and prices fell step by step. Seeing the step-by-step pressure of foreign flour and wheat, even the prediction that the flour price would reach 1.75 taels in the future is probably still questionable. As a result, this month fell by 0.75 cents compared with the previous day, November and December fell by 1.2 cents, January fell by 1 cent, and February and March fell by 0.5 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was very quiet after the opening in the morning. Because the quotation of foreign wheat slightly improved by about 10 cents, there were few sellers, and the bulls did not dare to take action, resulting in very few transactions. There was little short selling. When it opened in the afternoon, the transaction was slightly more lively, and the market atmosphere also showed a slight strengthening. After the big drop the day before, there were not many people who released real chips, so some short sellers covered their positions, and people's minds seemed to be stable. However, at this time when foreign wheat is becoming increasingly loose, there is little hope for the future. As a result, this month and February each improved by 1 cent, March improved by 2 cents, and February was unchanged. The spot wheat did not open all day due to the quiet arrival and sales.</p>

<p>A report from Sincere Trading Company stated that on Friday, Chicago wheat first fell due to the closing of long positions in the East, and then rose due to better export demand. As a result, each period rose by 0.25 points compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume on the 20th was 20 million bushels. The market prices on the 20th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>December 48.875 Up 0.125</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight contraction in the Dutch exchange rate, and the bidding price rebounded again. The trend of the public association's pricing is still firm. No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was bid at 14 taels, 9 mace, and 5 cents. Later, Changxing Company offered 200 bags at a price of 14 taels, 9 mace, and 2.5 cents, which was 2.5 cents higher than before. The trend of Dutch red sugar is firm and tight. No. 8 is 10 taels and 8 cents, No. 9 newly arrived white bags are 11 taels, 2 mace, and 7.5 cents, and flower oil bags are 10 taels, 9 mace, and 5 cents. On the foreign company side, the double T mark No. 24 high coarse white sugar was sold for 4 yuan and 6 cents, which was slightly lower by 3 cents than before, but with the exchange rate calculated, it was close to 15 taels. There were still few transactions. The blue bowl was previously offered at 2 yuan and 8.5 cents. According to telegrams from the producing area yesterday, it has risen to 3 yuan and 34 cents. The Chao merchants have dozens of newly arrived yellow Gangqing bags, offered at 9 taels, 4 cents to 5 cents, which is slightly looser than before. The local ice is 16 taels, 7 to 8 cents, and there are some offers.</p>

<p>The amount of silk consumed last month was 2,634 bales.</p>
<p>The previous month was only 856 bales, an increase of more than 1,000 bales.</p>
<p>New York silk mills, in view of the fact that Japanese silk prices are cheap but the quality is poor, and cannot be woven into silk alone, must be combined with Chinese silk, so the sales of Chinese silk have increased sharply. Last month (i.e., September), a total of 2,634 bales of white, yellow, gray, and Cantonese silk were consumed by the mills. The previous month (i.e., August) was only 856 bales, an increase of more than 1,700 bales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign tea market, the French Yongxing Foreign Company opened again for the core-drawn precious eyebrow green tea from the Incoming Manor due to foreign telegram demands. The top price for high-grade goods from the Wuyuan North Road was offered at 150 taels. However, the sales of ordinary precious eyebrow were still sluggish. Gongxi green tea was bought by the Russian Aid Society Foreign Company for more than 400 boxes of Tunxi goods. The selling price fell by another one or two taels compared with the previous one. The transactions of other items such as needle eyebrow pearl tea were also dwindling.</p>

<p>The British steel plate market standard was declining day by day due to large inventories and few outlets. Looking at all aspects of the environment, there was almost an unmanageable situation. Therefore, the industry was hesitant to order goods. Therefore, there have been no goods arriving in the market for several months. Although the transaction has not been very prosperous in the past few days, it has been much more active than before. Therefore, the market goods are inevitably in short supply, and the standard has a step-by-step upward trend. The main ones are listed below.</p>
<p>2.5 Cents Stockpiles Deep, Transaction Slight This cargo has a slightly larger inventory, but the outlet has seemed thin in recent days. Therefore, the market price is not as strong as 5 cents, etc. It is estimated that the price is 7 taels and 7 mace and 5 cents per dan. It is heard that only sixty or seventy dans have been offered. The importer is from the Changjiang gang.</p>
<p>5 Cents Spot Goods Thin, Customer Sales Strong Customer transactions have a lot of decoration for 5 cents of color. In the past few days, 4-500 dans have been offered. The price is 6 taels, which is 2 mace and 5 cents better than before. However, looking at the thinness of the arrival of goods and the firmness of people's minds, the future market is very promising.</p>
<p>7.5 Cents Qingdao Sales Lead The Qingdao gang is very serious about the 7.5-cent business, so in the past few days, they have also sold 600 pieces. The price is 5 taels and 7 mace and 5 cents, which is also 2 mace and 5 cents higher than before. However, the business in this street is also good recently, and the market goods are in short supply. The standard has a hope of improving again.</p>
<p>1 Cent Business is Best in This Street The shipyards and machinery factories in this street have a strong appetite for the 1 cent color. Export business seems to be limited, and the market price is very firm. It is estimated to be 5 taels and 2 mace and 5 cents.</p>

<p>From 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM yesterday morning, those who boarded the ship one after another to see him off included Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Wengan, Chief of Staff Zhu Peide, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu, Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission Shi Qingyang, Director of the National Health Administration Liu Ruiheng, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie, Vice Minister of the Interior Peng Xuepei, Central Committee member Ye Chucang, Secretary of the Central Political Council Tang Youren, Secretary of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi and his wife, and Chiang Kai-shek's representative Zhang Qun, Yan Xishan's representative Zhao Pilian, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Jianghai Customs Superintendent Tang An, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting, Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Wen Hongen, French Consul in Shanghai Mei Liai, and dozens of Wang's relatives and friends.

<h3 id="e145">The Situation of Boarding the Ship <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The French mail ship was docked at the China Merchants Bureau Middle Wharf in Outer Hongqiao. After 8:00 AM, dozens of people, including those who were seeing off Mr. Wang Jingwei and those who were sending him off, took photos on the ship (taken by Li Zunyong).</p>
<p>And reporters from various newspapers arrived one after another. They waited until 10:30, but Mr. Wang had not yet arrived. Just as they were anxious, unexpectedly, in order to avoid the noise and for the sake of careful vigilance, Mr. Wang secretly changed to the Jinghui launch of the Customs at the Xinguang Wharf and boarded the ship from the outer barrier. In advance, Wen Hongen, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, led the police to guard the Xinguang Wharf. Song Ziwen, Zhu Peide, and Chen Shaokuan arrived first. At about 10 o'clock, Mr. and Mrs. Wang and their daughters arrived and took the Jinghui launch together to the side of the French ship. At 10:20, Mr. Wang and his party boarded the ship and went to the first-class cabin to rest.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Wang's Face is Thin <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>When President Wang boarded the ship, the people who were seeing him off were chatting in the corridor outside the cabin. When they heard that Mr. Wang had arrived, they rushed to the reception room. The reporters who were waiting at the port also rushed to board. The reception room was narrow and crowded. Mr. Wang sat alone at the head of the case, resting slightly. Then he stood up, put his left hand on the table, raised his right hand and shook hands with the send-off one by one to greet him. After the handshake, the crowd stood around and chatted. Mr. Wang wore a moss green robe, talked and laughed with the guests, and was in good spirits, but his face was thinner than before, and he often stroked his waist with his right hand, as if he was very uncomfortable. Gu Mengyu saw this and asked if he was comfortable. Mr. Wang politely replied that he had talked for too long yesterday (i.e., the day before), and today (i.e., yesterday) he had to travel by boat, so he felt slightly uncomfortable. He thought he could gradually recover after resting in the ship for a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Talk to Reporters <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The reporters from various newspapers then had a two-minute conversation with Mr. Wang. According to Mr. Wang, he was suffering from tropical diseases and wanted to recover quickly, so he went abroad for treatment. There are no specialized hospitals for treating tropical diseases in England, France, and Germany, so which country to go to for treatment will be decided after landing in Marseille. He could not predict when he would return to China. He had to wait for the doctor's diagnosis before he could be sure. The opening date of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee was imminent, and he was afraid that he would not be able to make it in time. He would entrust someone to submit his proposal at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Set Sail at Eleven O'Clock <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>At 10:40, the guests who were seeing off said goodbye to Mr. Wang one after another. The reporters obtained Mr. Wang's consent and invited him to the deck to take pictures, while Mrs. Chen Bijun and her daughters stayed in a corner of the room, chatting with Mrs. Chen's mother and female relatives, unable to bear to part. It was not until the guest bell rang that they said goodbye to each other and went down the ship one after another. At 11:10, with a whistle, the wheel drums left the port.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang invited German doctor Noel to accompany him to Germany this time in order to examine his condition, take care of the medication, and monitor his vision along the way. Dr. Noel's wife and son originally wanted to return home, but Mr. Wang asked them to travel together. They all left on the French mail ship Andre Lebon yesterday morning. According to Dr. Noel, once Mr. Wang's illness is cured, he will return to Shanghai at any time. The period is expected to be in early spring next year. During the period of his departure from Shanghai, the diagnosis and treatment of the Noel Hospital in this port will be temporarily presided over by two assistants.</p>

If everyone can do this, China still has hope." Subsequently, Wu Jingxiong, Li Cishan, Zheng Zhengqiu, Zhang Zilian, Wu Shan, and others gave speeches one after another.</p>

However, weighing the pros and cons, we would rather make concessions internally to the greatest possible extent and never let the Tibetan bandits run rampant and increase the crisis of our nation. In addition to strictly ordering the original garrison troops in Xikang to resolutely resist, we also plan to transfer elite troops to reinforce. We are still determined to adhere to the principle of peaceful salvation against Fu and make concessions as much as possible. We will never resort to force unless it is unbearable. I hope that this message will be conveyed to the National Government and all the fellow villagers in Shanghai. I still hope that everyone will uphold justice and call for peace. I am very grateful.

<p>Two Japanese Warships To Enter Fujian</p>
<p>A certain merchant in this city telegraphed from Fuzhou yesterday that there are again Japanese warships coming to Fujian due to resistance to debt. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Workers Refuse to Load and Unload: In the past half month, the dumping of Japanese goods in China has gradually become active again. A lot of goods have also been shipped to Fuzhou. All circles in Fujian Province, seeing the continuous flow of Japanese goods, paid great attention. The loading and unloading workers and barge workers at various wharves agreed to refuse to load and unload. Whenever a Japanese ship arrives in Fujian, regardless of cargo or passengers, they are not allowed to load, unload, carry, or transport on barges. As a result, Japanese ships arriving in Fujian cannot load passengers and goods. The workers also strictly supervise non-Japanese ships to prevent them from being disguised as other ships and smuggled into Fuzhou.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Summoned to Fujian: Japanese shipping companies in Fujian, unable to operate due to this severe resistance, telegraphed Taiwan to hire Taiwanese coolies and dispatched barges from Shanghai to Fujian to prepare for self-dispatching workers to load and unload. Since the implementation, it has aroused major resistance from the dockworkers and the surface barge gang. Shantou and Xiamen have risen up in response, and the business community has also automatically boycotted. The Japanese merchants went a step further and urgently telegraphed Mawei to dispatch two naval warships carrying a batch of marines to Fujian to demonstrate. They are now arriving in Fuzhou.</p>
<p>The Decline of Japanese Shipping: The Japanese ships sailing from Shanghai to Fuzhou, including the Osaka Company's "Fujian Maru," "Changsha Maru," "Shengjing Maru," and three other ships, have always had a very large business and many passengers. Since the resistance to goods in Fujian, Shantou, and Xiamen, the Japanese ships going to Fujian have no cargo to load, and passengers do not take Japanese ships because they cannot go ashore. In the past ten days, the Japanese ships from this port to Fujian can be said to have no business at all, and only to Keelung do they have a small amount of cargo and passengers.</p>
<p>Xiamen Burned Japanese Goods: Yesterday, a certain merchant received a telegram from Xiamen that recently hundreds of pieces of Japanese goods, such as seafood and kelp, were shipped from Shanghai to Xiamen. They had been transferred from ships to barges and transported into the inner harbor of Xiamen. The matter was discovered by the goods-rejection investigators, who immediately detained the goods and intercepted the barge. They were immediately dragged to the port of Xiamen, and these hundreds of pieces of seafood and kelp and a civilian ship that carried them were burned together as a warning. Now the Xiamen gang has telegraphed to Shanghai, ordering them to pay attention to Japanese goods with changed brands and mixed in for shipment, and the shipping companies have also refused to accept Japanese goods to Xiamen.</p>

Afterwards, he will work under the leadership of the Municipal Government to promote the development of the city's health cause.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Chinese Southeastern General Association of the World Red Swastika Society replied yesterday to the United Association of Charitable Organizations in Shanghai for Disaster Relief for Northeastern Refugees: "Respected Sirs, We received your letter, stating that Changchun, Binjiang, Shenyang, Dalian and other places have relief work for this Binjiang flood. The truth and details of the flood, as well as the current needs, are not known in detail due to the distance. Please forward the letter to inquire and reply so that we can promote and raise funds in Shanghai, etc. After recording the letter and forwarding the inquiry, the Shenyang branch replied that the victims of this Binjiang flood were very numerous. All the miserable situations were reported by the Binjiang Swastika Society, and it is unbearable to hear. Although the powerful associations in the Northeast have raised funds to help with relief, it is only temporary relief. The severe winter is approaching, and the preparation and distribution of winter relief is an urgent matter. However, without a huge sum of 200,000 yuan, it is not enough to save these hungry refugees. Now that we hear that the major charitable organizations in Shanghai are jointly providing relief, it is fortunate for the disaster victims in the Eastern Province. Together with the Binjiang Swastika Society's repeated reports and correspondence regarding the details of the flood and the needs of the winter relief in the future, and a list of relief distributions, are copied and attached for your joint review. This copy of the letter and various letters and tables are attached for your reference. We hope that you will review it. Yours faithfully." A telegram from the Binjiang Swastika Society to the Shenyang Swastika Society reporting the disaster is also attached: "To the Northeastern Main Association: On Yu Ri, the embankment of the Mudanjiang River breached, and the flood overflowed. Boats sailed in the city, which has become a swamp. Reaching the Jiang'an coast, it is a vast ocean. Floating corpses are flowing horizontally, heads and flesh are separated, and land and houses have disappeared. The damage from the flooding is difficult to predict at the moment. The cries of the victims escaping and calling for help were heard and seen, and our hearts ached and tears fell. This association responded urgently, rescuing those drowning in the water with boats, and transporting those exhausted on the road with vehicles, and placing them in safe areas from danger. We established six shelters, accommodating more than 20,000 people. More than 30,000 refugees scattered at will, from Xu Gongbei to Jile Temple, sleeping in the open air, eating in the wind, suffering from hunger and cold. More than 30,000 people were given bread and steamed buns twice by this association to alleviate their immediate needs. This is why nearby branches should accept relief funds to help these hungry people. The reputation of the Swastika is at stake. The urgent need for benevolence is urgent. Special report. Binjiang Branch, Jia Yin." Also attached are several copies of the Dalian Swastika Society's remittance of 10,000 yuan for emergency relief and appeals to make the disaster situation clear.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Residents Re-petition the Railway Department Regarding the Site Selection for the New North Station <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>If There is No Approval, Representatives Will Be Sent to Peking</p>
<p>In order to build a new site for the North Station, the Two Routes Bureau has encircled more than 4,000 acres of land in the Zhenru and Pengpu areas. The villagers in the vicinity believe that the railway bureau does not need such a large area to build the station, and only 700 to 800 acres are enough. Therefore, they have petitioned the railway bureau, the Ministry of Railways, and the Municipal Government to reduce the amount of land encircled in order to alleviate the people's hardship. At that time, the Ministry of Railways replied that "regarding the encirclement of land, it cannot be used as a definite method for the railway, because it is still under consideration and there may be changes in the amount of land encircled in the future." However, recently, the Ministry of Railways has increased the encirclement of land by more than 1,000 acres, totaling more than 5,000 acres. The residents of the encircled area are worried about the increase in the encirclement of land by the Ministry of Railways. They first petitioned the Pengpu Municipal Committee Office. The Municipal Committee approved the Municipal Government to handle it with the Ministry of Railways. However, there has been no reply so far. The more than 500 villagers who were encircled now plan to submit a document to the Ministry of Railways first to request relief. If there is no reply, they will send representatives to the Ministry of Railways to petition.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Residents and Shops on North Sichuan Road Petitioned Party and Government Organs Yesterday <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Purpose is to Reduce Rent in the War Zone</p>
<p>North Sichuan Road is a place where roads are built beyond the boundary. Since the January 28th Incident, the shops in the area have suffered huge losses due to the impact of the war. After the war, the resumption of business was even more dilapidated. In addition, false alarms were frequent, and people were panicked. The market was no longer as prosperous as it used to be, so the shops were closed one after another, and the rent was so high that it was difficult to maintain and difficult to recover. The citizens in the area went to the 25th Branch of the Citizens' Federation to discuss the matter. After unanimous deliberation, Wei Langxuan, Ye Qichang, Chen Jiufeng, Zhong Peishen, Li Zifeng, Hu Zhaoying, Guan Jichuan, and other seven people were elected to present the shop's account books and the citizens' opinions, and to report the actual situation of business losses. (1) Request the Municipal Government to base the standard for rent exemption in the war zone on the rent starting after the withdrawal of the Japanese troops from District D. (2) Announce that the rent in the war zone must be reduced by 40% to slightly reduce the burden and try to restore the urgent task. (3) Prohibition of eviction and one-sided complaints to the court. They were received by Xiang Weicheng, a member of the Municipal Government, who promised to convey the previous situation to the mayor as much as possible. The representatives then took their leave and went to the Municipal Party Department to petition. They were received by Zhao Erchang, a member of the Civil Training Committee, who described the plight of the war in general. Zhao promised to attach the petitions and various evidence to the Central Government for review and decision, so that they could liberate the citizens. The representatives were satisfied and left at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Disputes Over Increased Taxes on Tobacco and Alcohol Licenses <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Nine Industry Representatives Petitioned Party and Government Organs</p>
<p>Nine public associations in this city, including the tobacco exchange, the sauce and wine sauce encirclement, the restaurant, the dry tobacco, the local yellow wine production, the sorghum shochu industry, the Fen wine, and the Shaoxing wine, elected Chen Liangyu, Zhang Suhou, Qian Wenda, Zhang Dalian, Han Xingwei, Chen Weiwen, Fang Zhongheng, Cheng Kefan, Xie Zhendong, Zhang Songji, Chai Yasheng, and other representatives to gather at the Fumin Road Tobacco Exchange Industry Association at 10:00 AM yesterday. They took two cars to the Municipal Government for a joint petition. At 11:00 AM, the representatives advanced with documents and were received by Section Chief Xu Shaoxiu. The representatives stated that Wang Yao, the contractor of the Shangbao license, was using the police district to assist in implementing harsh harassment and forcing small shops to stamp their seals and acknowledge double the tax payment. If there was any delay, they would be summoned and detained by the police. The small merchants were unable to resist and sent the tax payment to the public association, asking the chamber of commerce to donate on their behalf. The chamber of commerce accepted and handled the matter, but it has not been resolved. Recently, the Shangbao Branch has become even more severe, harassing the chamber of commerce. Members have repeatedly reported that if there is no relief method, they will have to close their business and wait for death. The representatives feared that misunderstandings might occur if this continues, and the expansion of the turmoil would hinder public security. In addition to the actual presentation to the Tax Administration, they specially petitioned your government. Before the deployment is resolved, please order the Public Security Bureau to instruct the various districts not to assist in the harassment for the time being. Section Chief Xu replied that the government and the Public Security Bureau should maintain the duty of maintaining public order with importance to the situation. He immediately instructed the Public Security Bureau not to harass and handle it peacefully. At 11:00 AM, they went to the Municipal Party Department and were received by He Yuanming, who was responsible for mediating the disputes. The representatives said that if they could pay taxes and receive licenses according to the original amount of the Fen wine industry, there would be no problem. Otherwise, they would only ask for a thorough solution. Mr. He agreed to ask the Public Security Bureau not to make things difficult for the time being (the rest is omitted). At 2:00 PM, they went to the Social Affairs Bureau, but the director was out on business. They agreed to meet again on Monday. At 2:30 PM, they went to the Public Security Bureau and were received by Yan Zhizhai from the Second Section. He said that tax affairs are not within the scope of this bureau. The government orders assistance, which is the duty to be fulfilled. Now that your representatives have petitioned the municipal government, they should abide by the order and handle it peacefully, and will not harass or detain. At 3:30 PM, they went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and were received by Zheng Chengqing. The representatives briefly described the facts of the petition and asked for a fair claim and a letter to the Public Security Bureau to order the various districts to be cautious and peaceful. All tax payments should be handed over to this association for safekeeping, and the deployment should be resolved quietly. Do not be alarmed. The representatives were satisfied and took their leave.</p>
<h3 id="e174">News of Consular Visa Manifests for Foreign Goods <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>According to news from the local customs, since the implementation of the method for consular visa manifests for foreign goods, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has successively established consulates in major cities or product-producing areas of various countries to handle visa matters. However, due to personnel issues, consulates have not yet been established in Constantinople and Smyrna in Turkey, Danzig in Poland, Nars in Finland, and Pech in the Czech Republic, resulting in no one to handle consular visa issues. The Customs authorities have now received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that the consular visa matters for the above five locations have now been entrusted by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the U.S. consuls in those locations for handling. Before our country's visa forms are sent to those locations, U.S. cargo manifests will be temporarily used uniformly.</p>

<p>Total Weight Exceeds 10,000 Tons</p>
<p>Shipping Costs Exceed 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Arsenal was closed, a Shanghai Office was established, with Lin Tong appointed as its director. All machinery and materials of the factory, totaling approximately 10,000 tons, were transported to Nanjing starting yesterday (the 21st). The shipping cost is set at twenty yuan per ton, totaling over 200,000 yuan. The dismantling of machinery, loading, and handling are all the responsibility of the arsenal's technician, Liu Xikang, who will provide guidance. However, all personnel of the factory recently requested the Military Affairs Department to grant them three months' severance pay based on their salaries, similar to the former Wusong Fortress artillery, to show fairness. However, the director of the Military Affairs Department's arsenal department, after reviewing the request, telegraphed yesterday, agreeing only to grant each employee one month's retirement pay. For employees who remain in their positions, salaries will be paid at 64% of their original salary. It is reported that all personnel of the factory are currently continuing negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Preparatory Committee for the Chicago Exposition Establishes Sample Collection Offices in Beiping and Hangzhou <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Branch Offices to Be Established in Hankou, Tianjin, and Other Places</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Products to Be Sent to the Chicago Review Committee Nearby</p>
<p>The preparatory committee for participating in the Chicago Exposition recently held a committee meeting at the International Trade Bureau to discuss everything. Progress on this matter is currently quite active. The recent developments are divided as follows:</p>
<p>Chicago Organizes a Review Committee. The original rules set by the preparatory office stipulated that all products for exhibition must first be submitted to the office for review and qualification before being selected for display. The committee has now received a request from a majority of overseas Chinese, stating that it is quite inconvenient to transport goods from overseas due to the long distance. Therefore, they requested an alternative method. The committee has now approved this request and decided at a meeting that if any overseas Chinese products are available, they can first contact the committee. However, if it is inconvenient, they may apply to the Chicago committee's review committee nearby for a preliminary review. If qualified, they will be collected and displayed together with domestic products at the exhibition in Chicago.</p>
<p>Sample Collection Offices Established in Beiping and Hangzhou. Beiping and Hangzhou are areas where commercial development and products are concentrated, and transportation is also very convenient. Therefore, the committee has established sample collection branch offices in these locations to collect local specialties. After achieving results, they will be handed over to Shanghai. Currently, sample collection branch offices will also be established in Hankou, Tianjin, and other places.</p>
<p>Preparatory Meeting to Be Held Next Year. The committee originally planned to hold a preparatory meeting in Shanghai before participating in the Chicago Exposition. All products from various parties would be completely gathered in Shanghai, and experts from all walks of life would be invited to provide accurate evaluations, discarding the dross and preserving the essence. Then, they would prepare for all arrangements to participate in Chicago next June, so as to compete with other countries and not lag behind. However, it is reported that funding is currently lacking. The original amount of 400,000 yuan was allocated by the Ministry of Finance, but only 30,000 yuan has been received so far. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance is being asked to find a way.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Public Organizations in Anhui Oppose Grain Tax <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to Various Ministries</p>
<p>Anhui Public Organizations' Telegram to Nanjing: To President Song of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, President Shao of the Legislative Yuan, President Yu of the Control Yuan, and Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance: Recently, we read in the newspapers that the Anhui Grain Administration has been established, stipulating a tax of four jiao per shi for rice exported by sail, six jiao for transport by steamship, and three jiao for miscellaneous grains. Li Yunqi, Yu Youquan, and Lu Zhongnong have been appointed as directors of the Wuhu, Bengbu, Dashengguan, and other management offices. After reading this, we are extremely surprised and shocked. The Grain Administration is a disguised form of likin, a transformed version of the grain tax. Last year, Chen Tiaoyuan used the pretext of prohibition to establish this tax. The merchants and people of the entire province unanimously opposed it. An official request was submitted to the National Government, which issued a strict order for its abolition, and the Control Yuan filed an impeachment. Now, Wu Zhongxin, the chairman of Anhui Province, was then a member of the Control Yuan and was particularly critical in reviewing this case. Now that Mr. Wu is in charge of Anhui's administration and it is a time of local decline, he should learn from the past, change course, seek to restore vitality, and relieve the suffering of the people. However, he has violated his original intentions and continued to extract wealth, continuing Chen Tiaoyuan's disastrous policies in Anhui. This is truly unexpected by the people of Anhui. Rice and grain have always been the main agricultural products of Anhui Province, with annual exports of approximately ten million dan, which regulates the province's finances. This year's harvest is abundant, with even more rice in storage. However, due to heavy taxes and merchants' hesitation, rice prices have not improved, directly striking farmers and indirectly causing social panic. The harm is immeasurable. It is also reported that the provincial government has decided to issue 5 million yuan in public bonds, using rice tax revenue as collateral. This action is even more absurd. Not to mention that there is no need for Anhui Province to issue public bonds, and the rice tax is an illegal and exorbitant levy that must be abolished sooner or later. Now, if it is used as a fund to issue public bonds, it is tantamount to forcing the people of Anhui to increase their burden by 5 million, which is illegal and harmful to the people. The people of Anhui will never recognize this. Therefore, we urge your esteemed Yuan to impose strict sanctions and not to approve the issuance of public bonds in Anhui Province. Also, limit Chairman Wu's time to abolish the Grain Administration to maintain the rule of law and relieve the suffering of the people. The telegram is urgent and awaits your orders. Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, Anhui Students Association in Shanghai, Anhui Public Interest Society, together bow.</p>

<p>According to news from the local Shanghai United News Agency, according to information circulating in business circles, the Japanese military has secretly ordered Japanese merchants in Shanghai to widely collect large quantities of leather goods, especially wool, which are secretly shipped to the Tokyo Army Uniform Manufacturing Plant to be converted into military cold-weather clothing for the use of warmongers attacking our volunteer army in the Northeast. The increasing number of unscrupulous merchants in this port who trade with them has greatly angered various patriotic organizations in the city.</p>

<p>Yi Zhen Hui Responds to Zhang Fang</p>
<p>Actively Raising Funds and Will Distribute Them as Soon as a Significant Amount Is Collected</p>
<p>Zhang Fang, chairman of the Henan Province Relief Association, recently sent a telegram to Shanghai to solicit donations from the Temporary Relief Association for the disaster areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei. The association responded with a telegram yesterday, stating, "Chairman Boying of the Kaifeng Relief Association: We have received your telegram. The disaster in Henan is severe, and we are deeply saddened. Providing relief and rescuing the victims is our unavoidable duty. However, our association has just been established and is actively raising funds. As soon as a significant amount is collected, we will send personnel to distribute it to fulfill your request. We hope to receive updates on the disaster situation in your province at any time to spread awareness. Sincerely, Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Shanghai Temporary Relief Association for the Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei; Wang Zhen and Wang Xiaoyu, Vice-Chairmen."</p>
<h3 id="e181">Jisheng Society Allocates Funds to Relieve Disaster Victims in Tanghe and Dengxian Counties <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society believes that the disasters in southern Henan, especially the natural and man-made disasters in Tanghe and Dengxian counties, are particularly severe. As a result, people have fled and scattered, and no one is cultivating the land. The wasteland is full of miscellaneous trees and almost ruined. Recently, Liu Zhenhua, the Superintendent, stationed in Nanyang, gathered the refugees, and the disaster victims gradually gathered, but they still lack clothing and food. They are looking to the wasteland, hoping for favorable weather, but the time for sowing wheat has passed, and next year's food supply is hopeless. Therefore, the Jisheng Society has allocated 8,000 yuan to distribute seeds and grain, with 3,000 yuan for Tanghe County and 5,000 yuan for Dengxian County, entrusting Yao Chongbang, chairman of the Nanyang branch, to handle it. The Superintendent will help to find ways to provide plowing cattle and protect them, so that the abandoned land can be turned into cultivated land, greatly benefiting the future of the people's livelihood. However, the wasteland is vast and the funds are limited. It is like pouring a cup of water on a cart of burning firewood, which cannot be universal. Patriotic people from all walks of life who have the intention to save the people should provide assistance so that the people of southern Henan will greatly benefit.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Tragic Case at Changchun Tea Garden on North Fujian Road <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Xiaowu Secretly Plots to Expose Villains</p>
<p>A Tragic Massacre at Changchun Garden</p>
<p>A tragic case of attempted robbery and assault occurred at the Changchun Baoji Tea Garden at No. 760 North Fujian Road. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Glimpse of Three People. Zhao Xiaowu, 36 years old, is a local ruffian near the Changchun Tea Garden and a regular customer of the garden. He usually spends his time there, associating with a group of petty criminals and engaging in mischief. Yesterday morning at 10:50, Zhao arrived at the tea house as usual for tea. He saw three people at another table across from him who seemed familiar. He soon remembered that they were his former accomplices in a previous case. He secretly observed their actions and saw that they seemed to be discussing some kind of event. Zhao thought about getting involved, but since he had not greeted them earlier, he was hesitant to speak up. So, he secretly left the garden and went to the Jin Dahua Tea House, where he told Ying Aliuliu and Wang Aqing about the situation and discussed a plan of action. After the three had agreed on a plan, they rushed downstairs and went straight to Changchun Garden.</p>
<p>Shot and Fell to the Ground. On the way, they happened to meet Detective Shang He of the police station. The three told Shang about the situation and invited him to join them. Shang believed that Ying and Wang were his partners, and since they sincerely requested his help, he should lend a hand. So, he followed them. As they approached the Changchun Tea Garden, Zhao Xiaowu stepped forward, followed by Shang, and went straight upstairs. Reaching the tea table where the three were seated, Zhao asked, "Do you know Mr. Shang from the police station?" At the same time, Shang ordered the three not to move. Shang then examined the arm of the person sitting in the middle and saw that the tattoo was still clearly visible. He intended to arrest him on this pretext. However, this person was prepared and, seeing that Shang's expression was not good, quickly pulled out a pistol and fired a shot into the floor to warn them. A group of tea drinkers, hearing the gunshot, immediately ran downstairs in a panic. While they were in chaos, the man fired at Shang. Shang quickly fell backward and was not hit, but the bullet hit Ying Aliuliu, who was standing behind Shang. At that time, Zhao Xiaowu and Wang Aqing were about to run behind the three to grab them, but before they could move, Xiaowu was shot in the back of the head by the man and immediately fell to the ground. Wang Aqing was also shot twice and fell into a pool of blood at the same time.</p>
<p>The Murderer Escaped. The three men, seeing that they had caused a disaster and achieved their goal, took advantage of the confusion to mix into the crowd and escape. By the time the nearby patrol police arrived, they only saw Xiaowu, Aliuliu, and Aqing lying on the ground. They immediately reported to the Old Zha Police Station and summoned an ambulance. They first sent Ying and Wang to Tongren Hospital, and then sent Zhao Xiaowu to Renji Hospital, but he had already died. His body was then transported to the forensic laboratory on Feilun Road for examination. Ying Aliuliu was shot in the chest and lungs, and his injuries were severe. He lives at No. 1922 Gao Lan Lane, Haining Road. Wang Aqing was shot through the left eye, and his left arm was injured. He lives at No. 523 Tangjia Lane. At around 9:00 p.m., Yu A'gen, the chief detective of the Old Zha Police Station, arrested one of the murderers and two women in a lane on Robert Sheng Road in western Shanghai. They also seized three pistols. At 10:00 p.m., they arrested two more women elsewhere. The two murderers who were at the scene are still being pursued.</p>

<p>Fan Pengke Departs Shanghai</p>
<p>Traveled with President Wang Yesterday</p>
<p>To Hunt Tigers in Sumatra</p>
<p>Hollywood's famous movie star Fan Pengke traveled from the United States to China via Japan for sightseeing. After staying in Shanghai for more than a week, he played golf twice, but unfortunately lost both times. It is reported that after his golf failure, Mr. Fan decided to go to Nanyang to hunt tigers. Yesterday at 11:00 a.m., he boarded the Picture of Fan Pengke on the Anfan Pengke in Shanghai (Photo by Li Zunyong)</p>
<p>De Laipeng French mail ship and left Shanghai to hunt tigers in Sumatra. Mr. Fan traveled on the same ship with Premier Wang Jingwei, who was going to Europe for treatment. He boarded the ship at 10:10 a.m. yesterday. Premier Wang had not yet arrived. The dignitaries who were seeing off Premier Wang were waiting in the cabin on the ship. Suddenly, they saw the movie star they knew so well on the screen, and they all cast curious and warm glances at him. It is currently undecided how long Mr. Fan will stay in Sumatra. According to Mr. Fan, if his wife, Miss Biquefu, still plans to come to China for sightseeing as scheduled, Mr. Fan will also return to Shanghai from Sumatra for a third tour of Shanghai. Mr. Fan wore a brown suit yesterday, and his face was unusually dark, but he was in good spirits.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Han Traitor Zheng Xiaoheizi Arrested in Hongkou <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Ji Zhongtang Shot to Death by Those People</p>
<p>The Corpse's Mother Reported to the Police Station for Arrest</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Shanghai war, Hongkou, Hujia Muqiao, Xiangyanqiao, and other places were the first to fall, and they were the last to be recovered after the armistice. Therefore, Jiangbei hooligans such as Wang Shubao, Wang Sanshizi, Zheng Xiaoheizi, and others acted as traitors in that area, taking the opportunity to rob and set up opium dens and gambling houses, committing all kinds of evil. Later, Ji Zhongtang, a Jiangbei native who had served as a detective in the Public Security Bureau, was released from the Caohejing Second Prison after being convicted of fraud. He also went to Hujia Muqiao, intending to join their gang and share the spoils. However, due to uneven distribution of the spoils, he was shot and killed by Wang Shubao, Wang Sanshizi, and Zheng Xiaoheizi. At that time, it was still under Japanese military control, so the family managed to transport the body out. After the local court verified the cause of death, it ordered their arrest. Unexpectedly, Wang Sanshizi and Zheng Xiaoheizi have now made countless amounts of money through their evil deeds and have opened tea houses and cigarette shops in Xiangyanqiao. The day before yesterday, they held a birthday celebration for their mother and sent out invitations. The corpse's mother, Ji Wu, learned of this and reported it to the Fifth District Third Precinct, which sent police to the banquet to arrest Zheng Xiaoheizi. The others escaped. After being arrested, he confessed to the previous events. He has been handed over to the Public Security Bureau and then transferred to the local court for prosecution.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Petty Traitor Arrested in Wusong <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Committed All Kinds of Evil During the Japanese Occupation of Wusong</p>
<p>Yao Lansheng, a local resident of Lijia House on Xi'an Road in Wusong Town, has always been idle and associated with vagrants. During the Sino-Japanese War, when the Japanese army occupied Wusong, he dared to rely on the power of the Japanese to gather gangs to rob people while the local residents had fled. The victims were angry but dared not speak out for fear of being reported to the Japanese army, which would lead to their deaths. Therefore, everyone called him a petty traitor. After the situation calmed down, someone reported him to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The day before yesterday morning, Chen Caifu and other detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, carrying official documents, came to Wusong and went to the address to arrest Yao Lansheng. On the spot, they found several wool coats, four chairs, and other stolen goods in his house. They immediately took Yao to Shanghai for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Has Scheduled Mediation</p>
<p>Regarding the labor strike of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) route ships of the British Taikoo Company, the Municipal Government yesterday ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters, investigate and handle the matter. It is reported that the Party and government organs have discussed measures and scheduled mediation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Orders the Social Affairs Bureau: The Municipal Government issued an instruction to the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, stating the following: “In compliance with the matter, we received a letter No. 1706 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, regarding the petition submitted by Zhou Xiaoting, representative of the Seamen's Middle Class Guild, and Gao Yongliu, representative of the seamen and middle-class workers of the Taikoo ships, which stated: 'We, the workers, serve on the various ships of the British Taikoo Company, working in the middle class cabins, to make a living. Currently, due to the failure of the compradors of the Changjiang route ships to pursue their selfish interests, they have united and, relying on the power of foreign merchants, are reducing workers and arbitrarily oppressing them. The livelihoods of our thousands of workers are about to be plunged into misery.</p>
<p>Therefore, we specifically submit this petition jointly, detailing the existing improper practices of each ship and the conditions discussed between labor and management. We earnestly request that the China Navigation Mutual Aid Association be ordered to prevent the compradors of each ship from reducing workers, in order to maintain the people's livelihood,' etc. Upon investigation, if the statements in the original petition are true, it is appropriate to forward the order to prevent this, in order to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. Accordingly, we are forwarding the original petition and other documents to your Municipal Government for investigation and handling, and we hope to receive a reply for our review. While the matter was under review, we also received a letter No. 1942 from the Mass Movement Guidance Committee of the Central Executive Committee (excerpt omitted)..." In view of this, we hereby issue this order to your Bureau, instructing you to comply and, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters, investigate and handle the matter thoroughly and report back for review and forwarding. This order." The Party and government have scheduled mediation. After receiving the report, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters sent personnel to investigate the truth. Yesterday, they further discussed handling measures and decided that on the 26th, the Social Affairs Bureau would convene a meeting with representatives from the Seamen's Middle Class Guild and the China Navigation Mutual Aid Association to facilitate mediation, in order to prevent the labor strike from escalating and affecting navigation.</p>

(5) If each company needs official police escort, it can apply to the Civil Affairs Department to order this district to dispatch official police to escort the ship. The escort team is divided into fixed and temporary types. (6) The entry and exit of each ship, and the dates and shifts of loading and unloading, must be notified to the district headquarters in advance during the winter defense period. If there is any change, it must be notified in advance. (7) If private smuggling of firearms and ammunition is found on each ship, the district headquarters should be secretly informed to arrest them. (8) The various cases were discussed and drafted, and the district headquarters printed them for distribution to each representative to take back for reporting. A letter was also sent to the shipping association for reference.</p>

<p>To Be Re-tiled with Black and White Tiles</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's Police Department, because the red paint painted on the roadside in places where vehicles are prohibited from parking is not easy to maintain after various tests, has now tested and changed to laying black and white tiles in each place. Because the black and white are mixed, it is very eye-catching, and the tiles are not easy to be made into the required red color. This matter has been approved by the board of directors, and Articles 28 and 48 of the Traffic Regulations will be amended. The date of implementation will be announced later.</p>

In addition, among the reservists recruited by the team last year, in addition to the 23 who have passed the dry firing test and have been added to the regular preparation after the Shanghai Incident, recently there are Zhuang Ruiwu, Jiang Chunrong, Li Weijun, Shen Xingquan, Weng Qinghui, Wang Yinting, Sun Jialu, Wang Rundao, Chen Wenliang, Gu Deyuan, Dai Yicheng, Zhu Jiren, Yu Lianquan, Wang Huihua, Cao Bin, Liu Yunqing, Wu Guozhang, and 17 others who have also completed the course and have been added to the regular training.</p>

<p>The Claims Committee of the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Promotion Association, in order to comply with the order to advise policyholders to temporarily suspend claims and wait for the Social Affairs Bureau to resolve the matter, has not yet made any statement. However, the policyholders are eager to receive compensation, and every day they come to No. 166th Avenue to inquire about the situation in an endless stream. Various public groups in Zhabei have also sent letters to the Promotion Association, willing to provide strong assistance and urge progress. Therefore, the Claims Committee of the Association specifically convened a full committee meeting at the Ningbo General Chamber of Commerce on Edouard Road at 7:00 PM yesterday.

<h3 id="e194">Public Works Department's Fire Department Report for September <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Fire Brigade responded to 53 fires in September. The most important was the Xinning Shao steamboat. On September 3, a fire broke out in the cotton-loaded cabin on the way to Shanghai. Fortunately, the crew managed to close it tightly. After arriving at the Ning Shao pier, the Central Fire Brigade went by fire boat to rescue it, together with the Chinese Fire Brigade. As a result, only 20 bales of cotton were lost. On the same day, several firefighters were fainted by smoke, and an ambulance was dispatched to rescue them. Unexpectedly, on the way back, they collided with a tram on the Avenue Edward VII, causing eight injuries.</p>
<p>On September 6, the Suiyang ship also caught fire. The ship was going to Wusong to load kerosene to Qingdao. Suddenly, a fire broke out in No. 3 cabin. It retreated to the Taikoo pier in Pudong, and the Hongkou and Central teams went by fire boat to rescue it. After four hours of work, the fire was extinguished.</p>
<p>The fire at Bao Cheng Silver House on Nanjing Road occurred at the end of September. Because the alarm was obviously too late, the fire was already raging when the fire brigade arrived. The houses there were old-fashioned, almost entirely made of wood inside, and there were several patios, so the fire spread very quickly. The Central, Xinzha, and Hongkou teams worked hard to rescue the fire and protect the surrounding houses. As a result, the silver house and the rented restaurants and fruit shops suffered heavy losses. Fortunately, the surrounding areas were spared. More than 80 firefighters worked at the scene.</p>
<p>In total, the property endangered by fire in the concession and special donation areas this month amounted to more than 8 million taels, with an actual loss of more than 149,000 taels. The ambulance team dispatched vehicles 111 times, the hospital team dispatched vehicles 181 times, and firefighters were on duty in entertainment venues for a total of 9,409 hours.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Further News on the Yarn and Cloth Exchange Case <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Exchange Discussed the Situation and Settled the Matter</p>
<p>Actually Due to Force Majeure During the Shanghai War</p>
<p>Guo Wen News Agency reports that regarding the contractual disputes between clients Sha Weiyi, Fu Zidong, etc. of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange, who refused to settle the matter with full price reduction as resolved and announced by the board of directors of the exchange, it was learned that the exchange had already been judged to have lost the case in the First Special District Court. The exchange refused to accept the judgment and appealed. Presiding Judge Hu Yigu accepted the case. As reported in the previous newspaper, the case was still heard in person by Presiding Judge Hu at 1:30 PM the day before yesterday. The lawyers of both parties began to argue fiercely. The appellants Gao Shouting, Mu Xiangyue, Hu Weizeng, and Zhang Binwei of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange were represented by lawyers Liu Chongyou, Zhang Shizhao, Wang Fuchang, and Chen Zhongyin. The appellees Fu Zidong, Sha Weiyi, Wang Junbai, Ming Jingheng, Chen Rongcai, Wang Shengsun, and more than ten other participants, including Wang Guanxian, were represented by lawyers Shi Jiong, Tao Jiachun, Yao Xichen, and Zhang Zhengxue. First, Liu Chongyou, the representative of the plaintiff, stood up to argue, stating that at the time of the Shanghai War, there was force majeure, and the futures trading could not be fulfilled, so it had to be settled. He also presented the government's and various armies' and organizations' declarations and telegrams of long-term resistance. Next, Wang Fuchang made many criticisms of the first-instance judgment, believing that the board of directors of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange had the right to settle on behalf of the clients. Next, lawyer Zhang Shizhao spoke, citing a lot of Chinese and foreign literature, law, and legal studies, mainly that in the 20th century, the individualism of Britain and the United States could no longer exist. Our country's bias towards the administrative nature of the continental policy is not appropriate. The first instance of this case was absolutely individualistic, which is very important to national morality. Moreover, if the exchange could not stop trading at that time, everyone would criticize and condemn it. Therefore, after considering the situation and reasoning, it had to be settled. Moreover, since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce did not take emergency measures, the exchange automatically dealt with it, but was convicted by the society, which is a disgrace to civilized countries, etc. Next, the defendant's lawyer Shi Jiong refuted it item by item. The lawyers spoke in turn, and the debate lasted until after 7:00 PM. Presiding Judge Hu announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment for November 2.</p>

<p>Members Visit Liu Haisu's Painting Exhibition</p>
<p>The Power of Liu's Solo Exhibition</p>
<p>Arouses Respect from Foreigners</p>
<p>Since the opening of Liu Haisu's solo exhibition hosted by the Municipal Government, viewers have been flocking in an endless stream, and the threshold has been worn through. Westerners who come to visit in groups are also in an endless stream. Western newspapers have published articles praising him highly. Yesterday, more than ten famous Western artists visited the art exhibition and were extremely admiring. At 5:00 PM, the Shanghai Art Club, organized by Westerners at No. 55 Hardoon Road, specifically invited Liu to a tea party. Those who attended included the chairman of the club, Flayes, Reuters newspaper reporter Rutter, Ge Yun, Director of the Supply Bureau of the Ministry of Communications and Posts, and artist members Gao Qi, Mrs. Walter, and dozens of others. They were warmly welcomed and expressed their utmost respect. It can be seen that Liu's solo exhibition has not only aroused strong attention from Chinese people, but also moved foreigners. It is heard that the Art Club plans to hold an exhibition on Central Road from November 6 to 21, and has firmly asked Liu to exhibit five or six pieces. Liu, in order to promote cooperation between Chinese and foreign artists in Shanghai, immediately agreed. Today is the eighth day of Liu's solo exhibition, with more than 6,000 visitors. Chen Gongbo, Peng Xuepei, and Chu Minyi, etc., came to Shanghai from Beijing to visit. Today is Sunday, and the number of visitors to the exhibition will be even more enthusiastic.</p>

<p>At 2:25 AM yesterday morning, when Hua Haishan, the owner of a cigarette and paper shop at No. 886 Xiaoshadu Road, West Shanghai, was fast asleep, two robbers suddenly broke into the shop door and entered the hall. They used guns to prevent Haishan from making a sound and searched everywhere. It happened that Chinese constables No. 2864 and 1088 of the Gordon Road Police Station were patrolling the area and saw that the shop door was wide open, which aroused suspicion. They stepped forward to investigate and saw that the two robbers were searching. The two constables immediately retreated and hid behind a large tree opposite the shop. Before long, the robbers plundered out. The two constables shouted to stop them. Fearing that the robbers would attack, they fired a shot into the sky as a warning. As soon as the robbers heard the gunshot, they ran away. The two constables also started chasing them. On the way, they met two Chinese constables patrolling and passing by, so the four constables joined forces and chased after them. When they were approaching Connaught Road, one of the robbers was captured and a fake pistol and hundreds of copper coins were found on him. The robber was taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. Under interrogation, he claimed to be named Zhang Amao and had an accomplice hiding at No. 421 Chongqing Road. The police station sent detectives to arrest Lu Mulin. The remaining robbers had already escaped after hearing the news in advance. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the two robbers to the court for trial. Because it was still necessary to investigate in detail, the judge ordered the trial to be postponed for a week.</p>

<p>Optimistic About the Future of the Jiangxi Situation</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and Wang Yansong, Executive Committee Member, flew from Shanghai to Xunyang to Nanjing to negotiate with the Jiangxi Provincial Government to abolish production and sales taxes and to investigate Jiangxi's industry and commerce, as leaders of the National Merchant Corps Representatives. They were then summoned by Chairman Chiang and went from Xunyang to Wuhan. They have now returned to Shanghai after completing their official duties. According to them, the banditry in Jiangxi, after being thoroughly suppressed, has been cleared from all places except for a very small part remaining in southern Jiangxi. For example, places like De'an, where travelers could not go before, are now accessible. The municipal administration of Nanchang has also made great progress recently. The cleanliness and spaciousness of the streets are actually better than those of Hangzhou. However, there is a lack of fully equipped hotels, but construction is currently being planned. Jiangxi's finances have always been very difficult. Recently, the central government has defaulted on subsidies, and on the one hand, it has to organize the aftermath of bandit suppression. After the provincial government reorganized tax revenue, eliminated corruption, and reduced waste, it has been able to achieve a balance between income and expenditure. The future of the Jiangxi situation is very optimistic.</p>

<p>The home of widow Wang Yu, residing at No. 71 Taian Lane, North Shanxi Road, was invaded by many thieves at around 6:00 PM on January 10 last year, who robbed her of property worth more than 300 yuan. When they were about to escape, they kidnapped her for a ransom of 100,000 yuan, agreeing to contact her near North Jiangxi Road on Edouard Road on the 19th of that month. The matter was detected by the police station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to arrest the thieves. The thieves resisted arrest with gunfire. Two thieves were shot and killed on the spot, and Jiang Dinghui and Wang Xianqiao (also known as Lao Wang) were arrested and sent to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation. Jiang was sentenced to death, and Wang was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, the thief who was looking after the ticket (hostage) had fled after hearing the news, and Ms. Wang also escaped. However, there was still an accomplice in the case, Wang Xunfu from Yangzhou, who was at large. At around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, Chinese Detective Shen Chongli of the Hongkou Police Station learned that Wang was hiding in a certain number in Yucai Road, Zhabei. He then coordinated with Western detectives and secretly went to the local Public Security Bureau. The detectives arrested Wang at the address and brought him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. Presiding Judge Shen Bingrong interrogated him. The police station lawyer stated that Wang had previously been shot in the right rib by detectives on Edouard Road, with the bullet entering from the front and exiting from the back. He had confessed to this at the police station. Jiang Dinghui had already been executed by firing squad. The lawyer then ordered the defendant to take off his clothes and show the gunshot wound on his waist, which was clearly visible. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, continued that due to the urgency of the case, the court should temporarily detain the defendant. When questioned, the defendant Wang Xunfu confessed that he had been invited by Jiang Dinghui to rob with five other people. He did not know Wang Xianqiao, who was sentenced to life imprisonment. The rest of his words were evasive. Judge Shen ordered the defendant to be transported to prison and rescheduled the interrogation.</p>

<p>Jin Deming, a Jiangbei man who sells tickets for the British and American Tram Company, No. 148, and lives at No. 31 Mattehes Road, was arrested by Chinese Detective Zhang Liang and Western Detective Elder of the Gedeng Road Police Station the day before yesterday for allegedly intimidating and attempting to extort 1,000 yuan from Chen Jikun. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court. According to the police station lawyer Wang Yaotang, the case was stated to be prosecuted in accordance with Article 370, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. According to the victim Chen Jikun, he is a coppersmith in the Public Works Bureau's Motor Vehicle Office. He used to live with the defendant, but now he has moved to No. 72 Xinkang Lane, Xinzha Road. At around 5:00 PM on the 11th of this month, after returning home from work, he passed Mattehes Road and suddenly met the defendant's wife, Jin Guan, who greeted him and said that the light in her home was broken, and asked him to go and repair it. He followed her to her bedroom. Just as he was about to repair it, the defendant suddenly arrived and accused him of harassing his wife, making a lot of noise, intending to extort 1,000 yuan. After negotiation, the defendant wrote a promissory note for 100 yuan and forced him to sign his name and fingerprint on it, and said that if he dared to report to the police station or leak the news, he would be shot with a gun. He was forced by the power of evil and had to agree and retreat. Until yesterday, he suddenly received a threatening letter, attempting to extort 1,000 yuan. He then took the letter and reported to the police station, which sent detectives to arrest the defendant. According to the defendant's wife, Jin Guan, Chen suddenly broke into my bedroom on the afternoon of the 11th, and saw that my husband was not there, so he wanted to force me to do something indecent, and took off his upper body clothes. I refused him, and soon my husband came home and negotiated with Chen. I did not invite Chen to my home to repair the lights, etc. When questioned, the defendant confessed that Chen Jikun was previously my tenant and later moved out. At 5:30 PM on the 11th, I came home and saw Chen and my wife in the room, and Chen's clothes were taken off, and he was wrapped in a blanket, looking very embarrassed, lying in the toilet. I negotiated with him, and he volunteered to write a promissory note for 100 yuan as a settlement. I could only bear it because my family's ugliness should not be publicized. I don't know anything about the threatening letter. This is Chen's fabricated slander. I have been working in the tram company for more than 20 years and have never had any illegal behavior. Now Chen wants to forcibly occupy my wife, but he has fabricated facts to cover up the case. His heart is extremely vicious and should be investigated clearly. He also hired a lawyer to defend him in court. The police station lawyer Wang also said that Chen's teasing was indeed a fact. Judge Ge Cixun checked the confession, ordered the defendant to write numbers in court for verification, and then declared the defendant Jin Deming innocent. He was allowed to post bail and leave the court for instructions during the appeal period.</p>

<p>Xu's Improper Behavior in Court</p>
<p>Greatly Rebuked by the Judge</p>
<p>Lu Xin, the wife of Xu Yongyao, that is, lawyer Xu Zhaohuan, is the daughter of Lu Yunsun. Yunsun passed away in March of the 17th year of the Republic of China. The property he left behind has been distributed equally among his wife and children in accordance with current laws and regulations, and an analysis document has been signed to ensure compliance. However, just three years after Yunsun's death, his daughter Lu Xin also died of illness in December of last year. However, after the death of his wife, Xu Zhaohuan suddenly asked Lu Mingsheng and others to analyze his father-in-law's inheritance, saying that although Lu Xin had passed away, she left behind two sons, the eldest being Weiyuan and the second being Weichong, who should inherit on her behalf according to law. Because the two sons were young, he made a special claim as their representative. However, the Lu brothers refused, causing Xu to sue them in the First Special District Local Court. During the trial, Lu and others hired lawyer Chen Ying to defend them and submitted an analysis document proving the amount of inheritance that Lu Xin had received at that time, which was covered with Lu Xin's seal. Therefore, at the end of the first instance, it was recognized that the plaintiff's lawsuit was completely unreasonable, and the lawsuit was rejected and ordered to bear the litigation costs. Xu was greatly disappointed under the judgment and hired lawyer Lu Qing to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. After a hearing was held once, the hearing was postponed because the appellant requested to add witnesses. Yesterday afternoon, the hearing was continued by Presiding Judge Hu Min of the Second High Court, together with Judges Cai and Lin. The witnesses Lu Qi, lawyer, and Ding Mingquan, doctor, both arrived in court one after another, but most of the appellees did not arrive. First, Ding stated the situation of Lu Xin's medical treatment. Next, Lu Qi stated the characters present at the time of the Lu brothers' property analysis. Lawyer Yan then said that today most of the appellees did not arrive at the building and requested that the witnesses be questioned separately to prevent them from colluding in the future, or that the hearing should be rescheduled until all the appellees had been summoned for the next hearing. The court was deeply dissatisfied with this situation, which was actually delaying the litigation. Unexpectedly, Xu Zhaohuan suddenly stood up and claimed that such questioning could not be considered effective and asked the court not to question any further, saying that questioning was also ineffective. At the time of the speech, he was restless, unsteady in his actions, running around and not paying attention to the order of the court. Presiding Judge Hu was outraged by this strange situation and sternly rebuked him, saying that the purpose of the appellant was purely to focus on money, and he had disregarded the friendship of relatives. Looking at his actions, it can be said that he was blinded by greed, otherwise, how would he dare to make such nonsense, even saying that there was no need to question any further, even if questioning was ineffective, it was to command the judge as a litigant, not only interfering with the trial, he had been a judge for 20 years, and such illegal actions were still a new idea. It is feared that it is not only the case that there are no courts in all of China, but also no courts in Europe and the United States. When the lawyers in the audience heard this, they were all moved, but Xu did not feel it much and frequently claimed that there were still requests, but it was already six o'clock. Judge Zhong ruled that since the appellees had not all arrived, it was difficult to conclude the hearing and ordered that the hearing be continued at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Murder of Barber Ma Yuangui <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The Murderer Confesses the Reasons for the Assassination</p>
<p>The Deceased Stole His Funds</p>
<p>And Falsely Accused Him of Having an Affair with His Daughter</p>
<p>Ma Yuangui, 32 years old, a barber from Zhenjiang and a partner in the Ying Ji barbershop at No. 12 Yuxing Street outside Xiaodongmen in the French Concession, was lured out on the evening of the 4th of this month by Ding Mingcai (52 years old), a fellow townsman and barber, under the pretext of going out for fun. In the Yixin Lane of Laoyongan Street, Xiao Famin suddenly attacked, stabbing him six times in the lower abdomen and both arms. He was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment in a police car. At the same time, detectives arrested the murderer in room 37 of the Chunjiang Hotel in Shangren Lane, Wuma Road, in the Public Concession and sent him to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. Later, the victim died due to his serious injuries despite medical treatment. The corpse was inspected and identified by the prosecutor, and the corpse's brother, Ma Yuanqing, took it for safekeeping pending review. Yesterday morning, the case was further heard by Wang Gangxu, the chief of the criminal court, in Criminal Division One. First, Gu Shouxi, the police lawyer, explained the case and prosecuted the defendant for causing death by injury. Then, Detective Zhou Buguang reported the investigation process after the incident and the circumstances of the defendant's arrest. Then, the deceased's brother, Ma Yuanqing, stated that his brother had been brutally murdered and requested justice. He also said that his brother left behind a widow who is now pregnant and about to give birth, and a six-year-old child. He requested compensation of 200 yuan for funeral expenses and 5 yuan per month for ten years for the child's education, totaling 600 yuan. Ding Mingcai confessed that the deceased and he jointly opened the Shanhaitang barbershop at No. 23 Bulao Sibi Street, Xueyueli, Vladivostok, in 1919, each contributing 200 yuan. The deceased monopolized the management. In 1928, he dismantled the partnership due to losses, and the defendant was reimbursed 40 yuan. Later, the deceased stole 200 Japanese yen and 40 US dollars and came to Shanghai. He wrote a letter to the defendant's son-in-law, Li Deming, saying that the defendant had an ambiguous relationship with his daughter. The son-in-law sent his wife, the defendant's daughter, back to his home and did not want her anymore, and also wrote to scold the defendant. Later, the deceased tried to rape the defendant's daughter, causing the defendant's wife to become ill with anger and resentment. For this reason, the defendant hated him to the extreme and killed him, and is now willing to plead guilty. The court verified the confession, but since the deceased's wife had not arrived, it ordered a postponement for further interrogation. The defendant was returned to custody, and the deceased's brother was instructed to bring the deceased's wife to court for verification next time.</p>

<p>Originated from Defecation</p>
<p>An old man named Yang Yonglin, who lived in Hujia Muqiao, Hongkou, went to the grocery store opened by Lu Zihuai early the day before yesterday morning to buy a piece of toilet paper for defecation. Lu reprimanded him for being unlucky to buy only one piece of toilet paper when the store had just opened. Yang retorted, and they started scolding and wrestling with each other. Yang was old and weak, and suffered injuries. He then returned home. His son, Yang Gensheng, saw that his father was seriously injured and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. At the same time, he reported to the Third Precinct of the Fifth District, but Lu had already fled. Yang died yesterday after being sent to the hospital for treatment. In addition to reporting to the police station, the son also went to the District Court to request an autopsy and arrest the murderer for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Blind People Gambling by Shaking Dice <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Spectators Could Not Help But Smile</p>
<p>Feng Zhong, an old woman from Ningbo and the hostess of Feng Tianxing's fortune-telling house at No. 130 Lafayette Road in the French Concession, was recently in financial difficulties and unable to make ends meet. She had a whimsical idea and invited ten blind people from the same industry the day before yesterday evening, including Han Longtai, Zhu Ahong, Dong Jintang, Zhang Aqing, Xu Qihao, Chen Qingjia, Ni Rongchang, Yu Yiwan, Yuan Gengsheng, and Weng Chengfang. Seven sighted people, including Zhu Aqing, Wang Akang, Sun Wenrong, Zhou Baoxing, Weng Yunchun, Li Zisheng, and Wang Mingjin, led them to the back hall of her house. The ten blind people gathered together to gamble by shaking dice, hoping to earn a commission. The sighted people called out "Green Dragon, White Tiger, Enter Treasure" from the side. They started gambling at around 10 pm and gambled until 3:10 am in the morning. Just as they were having a great time, the incident was discovered by the gambling squad of the French Concession Police. Chief Detective Li Yousheng, Deputy Detective Liu Kunbao, and Detectives Xiang Rongji, Xu Wenshao, and Zhang Dongcheng, along with Western Detective Ali Cai (transliteration), quietly went to the scene, first guarding the front and back doors, and then knocking on the door. They rushed in to search. Unexpectedly, the blind people, upon hearing the knocking sound, became anxious and came up with a plan. They immediately hid the dice and gambling money in their mouths or shoes, and used the dice shakers as teacups, pretending to be discussing business matters with their colleagues. However, everyone looked flustered. After repeated questioning by Detective Li and others, they discovered the flaws. They dug out four dice from the mouths of the blind people, including Han Longtai, and found more than 30 silver dollars, 247 copper coins, and four lottery tickets. They took them to the police station. After questioning by the police chief, he ordered the head to be detained, and each gambler was released on bail with a cash deposit of five yuan. At that time, only Zhu Aqing, Han Longtai, Wang Akang, Zhu Ahong, Dong Jintang, Zhang Aqing, and Xu Qihao were detained due to lack of funds. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the Second Special Court for investigation. When the bailiffs led the defendants to the courtroom, the blind people supported each other and walked in file, causing the spectators to smile. Everyone said that since the defendants were all proficient in fortune-telling, why didn't they each predict in advance that they would not fail? During the conversation, Yao Zhaodi, the police lawyer, explained the case and said that the defendants had committed the crime of gambling and requested that they be interrogated according to law. Feng Zhong confessed that she had gathered for gambling due to temporary financial difficulties, which she did not deny. Han Longtai all admitted to being gamblers. Judge Wu Fanglian verified the confession, announced the end of the debate, and adjourned for sentencing at a later date.</p>

Yesterday (22nd) at around 11:00 am, they hired a small iron-wheeled vehicle pulled by a local man named Tao He. While traveling near the intersection of Sichuan Road and Wuma Road, for some reason, the corrosive liquid they were carrying spilled on the ground, boiling and giving off a foul odor along the way. At that time, Yu Apin, who lived at No. 3 Huachang Lane, Beiqiujiang Road, was knocked to the ground by Zhu Xie Lin's bicycle. His clothes were corroded by the chemical, and many other pedestrians were knocked down by rickshaw No. 8566. The clothes they were wearing were all turned to powder. Many coolies stepped on the corrosive liquid, and their skin was immediately corroded, causing them to scream in pain. The order was greatly disrupted. The Global Automobile Company located there sent people to wash the road with tap water to avoid accidents. The damaged pedestrians all went with the rickshaw puller Tao He to Huafeng Paint Store to negotiate a settlement.</p>

The two people who were drawn this time were Chen Ganqing and Yang Zhixiong. The results of the association's election a few days ago were that Huang Xiaohan, Jin Yueshi, Wu Jinxiang, Shen Jiyun, Ma Jiajun, Zhu Zhe, and Huang Junxiang were elected. Among them, Jin Yueshi and Shen Jiyun applied for resignation because they each held positions in the shipping industry and found it difficult to juggle both. According to the regulations, Sha Xiangjia and Jia Dingxi, who had the next most votes, were appointed as replacements. On the same day, a meeting was held to discuss the method of recovering pilotage rights, the preferential treatment of foreign crew members by shipping companies, discrimination against Chinese crew members, and many other important motions.

<p>The German Dali brand beef juice and chicken broth, managed by Huasheng Company, a department store on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, was invented by Professor DPardre of the former University of Berlin. It is manufactured using the latest disinfection machine and cold-pressing method. Its function is to enhance the vitality of red blood cells and maintain the resistance to sterilization. It is truly the only tonic for those with weak constitutions. Since the product was shipped to China for sale, it has long been popular, and thank you letters from all walks of life have been pouring in. The company has recently shipped a large batch of beef juice and chicken broth from Germany for distribution to various ports to meet the needs of those who take it. It is said that major companies and pharmacies in this city and other ports are selling it.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Upon examining your newspaper's local news column on October 21st, an article titled [Negotiations Between Taikoo Company and Union Fail] stated that Xie Baosheng and others from the China Shipping Mutual Aid Association held four direct negotiations on September 26th, 29th, October 4th, and 14th. After reviewing this negotiation, I have not yet been informed, nor have I attended. What your newspaper published, I think it is rumors untrue, especially sent the letter for corrections, to show the facts. This to Shen Bao, Xie Baosheng, sealed, October 22,</p>
<p>Reading your newspaper on the 22nd, in the local news, it mentioned the cracking down of the Communist Party organs in Ningbo Road, which stated that on the top floor of Qian Xinglong Grocery Store at No. 236 Chongde Lane, the intersection of Ningbo Road and Shanxi Road, a distribution department of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party was set up to hide and operate, etc. After investigating, our store has nothing to do with this, and the door number is also wrong. Our store is No. 136. On that day, the top floor of No. 137 next door did have a crackdown on the Communist Party situation. It must be a false inquiry. I sincerely fear that outsiders will not know the truth, and the reputation of our store is at stake. I especially sent a letter to your newspaper, quickly making corrections, hoping for this.

<p>Nine Three Elder Ma Xiangbo's Sayings</p>
<h3 id="e226">Nurturing Children and Respecting Women <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Jing · Recorded ·</p>
<p>Elder Xiangbo sometimes strolled along the corridor in front of the Leshan Hall, slowly walking and looking at the flowers displayed on both sides; several times I heard Elder Xiangbo admire the beauty of the flowers, and even more praised the supreme goodness of the Creator: originally, the wealth and glory that enjoyed great fame in ancient times and scattered all over the ground are not as good as a fresh lily with complete color, fragrance, and taste in the field!</p>
<p>I remember once, Elder Xiangbo specifically pointed to a flower tree and said: [Take a closer look!] I paid close attention and watched for a while: the newly grown tender leaves are always well protected. From this, we can see the wonder of creation, telling people: nurturing children is the natural duty of the family; because children who cannot be independent, if they are not properly protected and educated, will be like those tender leaves that are not well protected, either dying prematurely or losing their beauty!</p>
<p>Next was the problem of [managing the family]. Elder Xiangbo quoted the Book of Changes sequence diagram, saying that there are men and women, there are husbands and wives, and then there are fathers and sons, accumulating into a family. He also spoke about respecting women from a doctrinal perspective. Jing notes: Min Yi Chen Shoufan's translation of [Training of National Character of European and American Powers] contains a passage that can be quoted to verify Elder Xiangbo's words. (See page 70 of the Commercial Press edition.) [All European and American countries know how to respect women: because doctrine declares that all personalities are equal before the Creator; and because of respect for the Virgin Mary, there is no base psychology of playing with ordinary women. Medieval knights paid more attention to this level. Afraid to follow each other, become customs, go out by car, but also give way to women. I should also improve customs ｜ At least in the family, the patriarch should abide by the [Father's Way] and [Husband's Way]; never arbitrarily scold his wife and daughter, often causing family tragedies! This is the first step in so-called [family management].]</p>

<p>丨Three Chapters of Outline丨</p>
<p>In this day and age, divorce is nothing more than the most fashionable thing. To open the skylight and speak frankly, divorce is nothing more than the most tragic thing. A husband cannot do without a wife, and a wife cannot do without a husband, like a person looking for food, and there is seven or eight points. Divorced husbands and divorced wives each regain their freedom, indeed getting what they want. But after divorce, everything inevitably feels unusually empty, and emotions feel particularly depressed, like the same person suddenly being unemployed, like to the extreme.</p>
<p>Working as a shop assistant, if your temper is bad, you will lose your job. Husband and wife often quarrel. Fights inevitably lead to divorce. Divorce is as painful as unemployment. Therefore, to not divorce, one must only abide by the [Way of Husband and Wife]. What is called the [Way of Husband and Wife]? Listen to me tell you.</p>
<p>If a husband has a lover, or a wife has a lover, the other party must not be jealous. Just go outside and find a lover yourself, each doing their own thing. This is the first chapter of the [Way of Husband and Wife]. If one party is drinking, watching dramas, gambling, or messing around outside, the other party must not pull a long face and admonish them, just follow suit and mess around outside. When the money is spent, they will naturally stop. This is the second chapter of the [Way of Husband and Wife]. If one party suddenly loses their temper, scolds a few times, and hits a few times, the other party must not retort or retaliate. When one party's anger subsides, then scold a few times and hit a few times in the same way. Although this is a revenge movement, both sides can understand each other. This is the third chapter of the [Way of Husband and Wife].</p>
<p>The above three chapters are just an outline of the [Way of Husband and Wife], but they have summarized the essence of the [Way of Husband and Wife] without leaving anything out. If you all recognize that divorce is a modern thing, and that not divorcing is not fashionable, then please do as you please. If you also say that divorce is painful, then please study the above three chapters. If you can put them into practice, I dare say that the old man in the divorce court will be dozing off, and the lawyers will have to give up their careers and change jobs.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Standards for Modern Women in Choosing a Spouse <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>丨The New Concept of "Marrying a Daughter a Cut Above"丨</p>
<p>In China, men and women have always been extremely unequal. In the eyes of most people, there is a deep-rooted concept of favoring men over women. Even when parents choose a spouse for their daughter, they always hold the prejudice of "marrying a daughter a cut above." In terms of wealth and reputation, the man's family must always be somewhat superior to the woman's family. Under such circumstances, in society, class boundaries are very clear in marriage. Young people from the proletariat absolutely have no possibility of marrying wealthy young women.</p>
<p>In recent years, superficially, women in general seem to have become more self-aware. The wave of the women's movement has spread throughout the country. The slogan of equality between men and women has become a tired cliché. However, from what we see in reality, where is there equality between men and women? A very high barrier still stands between them, because women themselves mostly hold a mistaken view, believing that they are inherently inferior to men in terms of strength, thus causing the prejudice of favoring men over women to continue to be passed down in Chinese society. Even in terms of marriage, although modern women in general have broken the concept of "marrying a daughter a cut above," in their minds, the spouses they choose do not necessarily have to have more wealth or reputation than the woman's family.</p>
<p>However, they still hold the old prejudices regarding academic qualifications: a woman who has graduated from elementary school must at least marry a man who has graduated from junior high school; junior high school graduates must marry high school graduates; high school graduates must marry college graduates; after graduating from college, they will only marry those who have studied abroad; if they cannot find someone who has studied abroad at a higher level, they have to settle for marrying a fellow returnee. If they do not fit these criteria, they would rather not marry and embrace singlehood. Under these circumstances, it is evident that women still acknowledge their weakness compared to men and want to rely on men for life. What is the difference between this and the former concept of "marrying a daughter a cut above"?</p>

<p>丨All Spent on the Child丨</p>
<p>When a person is in her maiden days, which dreams of the future are not splendid and extraordinary? But what is the result? Mostly disappointment! Believing that life after marriage is far from as ideal as in maidenhood, resulting in disappointment and frustration, and from frustration to a little discouragement!</p>
<p>In reality: maidenhood is a woman's golden age, making us always cherish the memorable past. I have now changed from a maiden to a young married woman. I can only ponder the past; I can only imagine the future; I am just at a loss for the present!</p>
<p>Before, I thought that after marriage, I could manage the household chores while still reading and studying, and then spend my free time chatting and laughing with my husband to relieve loneliness. Who knew that after getting married, I have to get up early in the morning to tidy up the room, buy vegetables, and cook. In the afternoon, there are still a lot of needlework and many miscellaneous things. There is simply no time left; moreover, now I have a child to feed, hold, and take care of. I am so busy! How can I still touch books? My husband cannot always come home often because of his job. Even if he does come home, he is worried about firewood, rice, oil, and salt. The so-called chatting and laughing can only be sought in dreams!</p>
<p>Most of the reduction in my happiness after marriage is due to economic pressure, and a small part is due to the entanglement of household chores. Fortunately, my husband is exceptionally considerate of me. Although we lack material enjoyment, we still have spiritual happiness. I am also very happy to have adopted a child. Although I usually feel disgusted when I see urine and feces, I don't feel that my child is dirty at all. Although I have to change dozens of diapers a day, I don't feel bothered because I think, "It should be so." When I have free time, I play with my child, and I find it particularly interesting. My days after marriage are spent like this!</p>

<p>丨A Typical Male丨</p>
<p>He grew up in a countryside rich in natural beauty; he is the son of a farmer, but he has received a considerable education. He is the most gentle, the most handsome, the most sincere, the most affectionate, the most noble; a person who is sound in both body and mind.</p>
<p>His gentleness is not weakness, nor is it cowardice; he is like a ray of sunshine after a long spring rain, shining on people, making them feel bright everywhere and happy everywhere.</p>
<p>His handsomeness is not decoration, not clothing; he is born with a great physique, dark skin, strong muscles, and an agile and healthy spirit, so people feel that he is beautiful in every way. His sincerity is not hypocrisy, not stubbornness; what is in his heart is what is in his attitude; regardless of joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness, everything is a pure expression of his inner self.</p>
<p>His affection is permanent and unchanging; I remember when I had smallpox, he took care of me day and night; after smallpox, my face was scarred, but he still loved me as before.</p>
<p>His nobility is natural and subjective; once, the daughter of Wang the Millionaire and the younger sister of Chairman Li tempted him with love, but he rejected them all. He said: "The most valuable thing in life is dedicated love."</p>
<p>His body is very strong; he has never been sick. He can ride horses, play ball, swim, and race.</p>
<p>His knowledge is very accurate; he can write, compose, paint, and sing.</p>
<p>He has lived in my heart since childhood, and his virtues and talents have also gradually grown day by day. I cannot forget him for a single day, hour, minute, or second.</p>

<p>— Huang Wenhao</p>
<p>Chinese daughters are indeed Europeanized now. What we see every day are creatures with curled hair, painted eyebrows, outlined eyes, dyed lips, and protruding chests and buttocks, active in the world. I translated a piece of writing about women's virtues to offer before Mrs. Indamore: Excessive decoration of clothing is enough to prove that you do not understand the true meaning of beauty. Every time a new fashion becomes popular, you should pay attention to whether it suits your personality. Blindly following is not acceptable. Do not wear faded, stained, or other unclean clothes in the home. At the breakfast table, you should wear clean and bright clothes, because it can bring an indescribable joy to the whole family.</p>
<p>Fresh air, moderate exercise, and a balanced diet can give you natural beauty. Material cosmetology is enough to cover your true beauty.</p>
<p>A gentle voice is a recognized virtue.</p>
<p>Kissing is common in social situations, but be cautious. Before understanding your friend's attitude, keep romantic terms as far away as possible in your conversation. Otherwise, the word "Dear" will be followed by the word "Detestable."</p>
<p>On a bus or tram, if someone gives you a seat, do not forget to thank them. It does not cost you much, but the reward the other person receives can be felt. Do not open your small umbrella in crowded places or place it at the entrance or exit.</p>
<p>If two men are walking together, and you are standing in the middle, you should hold both of their arms or neither of them.</p>
<p>When you are hosting a banquet, you should pay attention to the number of guests invited. It should not be too many, because it is easy to have problems such as inadequate care, slow service, and inability to fully enjoy the event. Do not suspect that a friend's attitude towards you is different because you were not invited to a banquet this time. In fact, they also have other friends, and it is not convenient for you to gather together at the same time.</p>
<p>When a friend shows you a newly bought item for you to see, you should not say: "It's too expensive. I would never pay that price." This unintentionally implies that your friend was foolish to pay so much. Do not ask your friend how much the new clothes they are wearing cost. When you know that your friend is starting to read a novel, do not tell them the content and nature of the book in a self-righteous way, because you can reduce their interest in the book, and the author of the book can tell them more than you can.</p>
<p>When you meet friends, do not praise how clever and cute your children are, otherwise, it will cause your friends to feel uncomfortable. When your husband comes home tired from work, do not bother him with trivial matters in the family. You should smile at him.</p>
<p>Do not leave the bedroom before your hair is styled, and do not go outside wearing casual clothes.</p>
<p>Do not criticize the servants in front of your husband. If you have something to say, you may as well wait until he has left.</p>
<p>Treat your husband, do not be attentive one moment and indifferent the next, because living together is forever!</p>
<p>Do not neglect your husband because you have children.</p>
<p>Make sure that your husband can always see lively children and a clean house when he comes home.</p>
<p>After marriage, continue to love your husband with the same attitude as at the beginning, and this will show your sincere character.</p>
<p>Do not use household expenses to buy your personal clothes and accessories, and do not wear torn clothes in front of your husband.</p>

<p>Supplement to the *Shen Bao* Local News</p>
<p>Speech</p>
<h3 id="e232">Liang Zuoyou and Zhang Zongchang the Buddha <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Regarding Liang Zuoyou's donation of wealth to save the country. I made a categorical statement in my previous commentary, that Liang definitely would not have such a large sum to rescue the country, because I have never seen a wealthy person who does not seek fame. Yesterday, I saw a report that a certain celebrity in Tianjin had sent someone to Huang County to secretly investigate and found out that Liang's family was poor, with only half an acre of land, and they relied on a younger brother to help them make a living. Liang had a good friend, A, who was an adjutant following Zhang Zongchang. In 1927, when Zhang failed, A carried a suitcase to Liang's house, claiming to be going to Dalian. Unexpectedly, A went out to visit friends and never returned. Liang opened the suitcase and found more than a hundred foreign bank checks, worth more than 30 million yuan. Liang was afraid of getting into trouble and kept silent. After Zhang was assassinated, he planned to donate the money to the National Government. This situation may have happened. Then it is clear that the money was not Liang's.</p>
<p>However, there are still several points of doubt. (1) When Zhang Zongchang was in Shandong, he must have had many trusted followers. Why would he entrust the important value of more than 30 million to an adjutant who was a follower, and not send a trusted person to accompany him? (2) Zhang had been in Shandong for a long time, and the adjutant's relatives and friends must have been numerous. Why would he hand over the suitcase to a poor scholar? (3) Why did the adjutant go out to visit friends and never return? These are the three points of doubt. In addition, there are two other points of doubt. Zhang Zongchang lost such a large sum, did Zhang not mention it? Why did no one know? It is suspected that Zhang had savings in a foreign bank. I do not know the rules for depositing money in foreign banks, but if a check is lost, is there no other way, such as declaring it lost, to recover the deposit? That is doubt number two. Assuming that there are other ways to retrieve it, then this kind of check is as good as waste paper. The check is already a bounced check and can hardly be cashed. These points are my hypothetical doubts and are not worth mentioning.</p>
<p>In short, this statement is still close to the truth, because only Zhang Zongchang would have such a large fortune, and only this kind of unclear money would be donated in such a large amount of 30 million. Assuming that this matter is indeed true, I cannot help but have a feeling that Zhang Zongchang extorted the people's wealth in Shandong, leaving no stone unturned. Zhang spent money like water and was quite generous. Just taking his concubines as an example, it was said that he had as many as twenty-six at the time (currently there are still fifteen who are said to be being dismissed). The extent of his extravagance can be imagined. And Zhang still had a huge sum of more than 30 million deposited in a foreign bank. May I ask where this kind of huge sum came from? It was nothing more than accumulated wealth from extorting the people's fat and cream. It is clear that it was money acquired through sin.</p>
<p>The *Book* says, "Wealth acquired through immoral means will also be lost through immoral means." Zhang Zongchang's lifetime of wealth acquired through sin, I do not know what karma caused it to fall into the hands of Liang Zuoyou, and I do not know what karma caused it to be transferred to the country. Zhang Zongchang probably did not expect this in any way. The saying goes, "Life and death are destined, wealth and honor are in the heavens." Money obtained through robbery by any means is always unreliable. It is not only Zhang Zongchang who is like this. Since the Republic of China, the money of warlords has either been seized by others or disputes have arisen due to unequal distribution of spoils. This has already been seen many times. Several warlords should also have some awareness of this and stop desperately extorting to fill their own pockets! Lord Mengchang said that accumulating wealth to leave to descendants is not knowing who they will be, and neglecting public affairs will lead to daily losses. It can be seen that in ancient times, accumulating wealth to leave to descendants was not worthwhile. Now people actually want to accumulate money for Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Wu, and Zhao Liu. It is really foolish.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Mineral Fertilizers: Superphosphate and Chilean Saltpeter <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Zhanneng</p>
<p>Superphosphate and Chilean saltpeter are both major nitrogenous fertilizers that can supplement the deficiency of animal and plant fertilizers, and their efficacy is faster than that of natural fertilizers, so this is of great benefit to agriculture. In our country, which is based on agriculture, special attention should be paid to this. I will discuss them separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Superphosphate</p>
<p>Superphosphate is a kind of artificial fertilizer or chemical fertilizer. In recent years, the superphosphate imported into Shanghai and major commercial ports is mostly the "Crescent" brand of the British firm Brunner Mond &amp; Co. and the "Lion and Horse" brand of the German firm Eilisse &amp; Co. In addition, the "Nine Bulls and Two Tigers" brand of the Chinese firm Zhaofeng Co., the "Man and Lion" brand of the New Construction Company, and the "Elephant" brand of the Linong Fertilizer Company are also very well-known. In addition, there are various other brands of superphosphate, totaling no less than thirty or forty kinds, which shows the wide application of superphosphate. Although the materials and ingredients of superphosphate are different, generally speaking, they are nothing more than ammonium sulfate, potassium sulfate, sodium nitrate, and superphosphate.</p>
<p>The properties of superphosphate Superphosphate is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (the three elements of plants), while natural fertilizers (that is, self-supplied fertilizers) contain very little, so its efficacy is very fast. However, natural fertilizers are rich in organic matter, which promotes the vigorous development of microorganisms and gradually improves the soil quality, while superphosphate does not contain organic matter, so if it is not mixed with natural fertilizers, the soil quality is very easy to deteriorate.</p>
<p>The application of superphosphate Our country's farmers are not used to using superphosphate, so caution should be taken when applying it. First, the type must be identified, and attention should be paid to the amount and method of application, because although superphosphate has a fast effect, if it is applied excessively, it often makes the solution in the soil too thick and alkaline or acidic, which damages the plants. The most reasonable application is to use self-supplied fertilizers such as compost, manure, and green manure as the main fertilizer, and then add superphosphate to supplement the deficiency of the three elements to maintain soil fertility. What should be paid most attention to is that superphosphate should not be used as a base fertilizer, but only for topdressing, and it must be applied in several times.</p>
<p>(2) Chilean Saltpeter</p>
<p>Chilean saltpeter is a natural mineral fertilizer produced in mineral deposits with scarce rainfall in Chile, Peru, and other parts of South America. The crude ore contains 17-75% sodium nitrate, the rest being sodium chloride (table salt), sodium sulfate, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, potassium sulfate, etc. Therefore, the crude ore after mining must be refined before it can be used. The refining method is to first crush the crude ore, place it in a large tank, and heat it with water, so that the ore dissolves. After cooling, the insoluble matter settles to the bottom of the container. Chilean saltpeter is stored in the solution and can be transferred to another tank and exposed to sunlight to evaporate and crystallize. The product obtained by this method contains more than 90% sodium nitrate, which is the Chilean saltpeter currently sold on the market.</p>
<p>The properties of Chilean saltpeter Usually, Chilean saltpeter contains about 15-15.5% nitrate nitrogen, which is easily soluble in water, so plant roots can absorb it immediately, but its properties are extremely hygroscopic and have a tendency to solidify the soil and deteriorate the soil quality, so it should not be used in paddy fields, because not only can it be lost with drainage, but the nitrate in it is also easily reduced and transformed into nitrite, which is harmful to plants. Chilean saltpeter has a great effect on dryland crops, even exceeding superphosphate.</p>
<p>The application of Chilean saltpeter Chilean saltpeter is easily dissolved by rainwater and lost, so it should be applied in several times according to the soil quality and crop type. The best time to apply it is when plants are growing vigorously. If it is applied in winter or when plant growth is slow, the effect is minimal. Chilean saltpeter is a simple nitrogen fertilizer, so it must be mixed with phosphorus fertilizer and potassium fertilizer (which should be slightly acidic, because Chilean saltpeter is a physiologically alkaline fertilizer), but it should not be mixed with plant-based organic fertilizers. If it is unavoidable or necessary, you must also choose fully decomposed ones to prevent nitrate from being reduced. This kind of natural mineral fertilizer is most suitable for vegetables, tea, mulberry, indigo, and other germination fertilizers.

<h3 id="e235">From the Issue of School Fee Payment to the Restoration of Labor University <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>In the column on the 14th, there was an article [Discussion on the Issue of School Fees]. After careful reading, it can be seen that the author has a lot of good intentions. The whole meaning is to painfully point out the badness of the current commercialization of education, so it is necessary to rectify the fee payment in order to achieve the popularization of education and the rationalization of fee payment. Although this is a pertinent statement of the current abuses, it is impossible to break through the barriers of reality. Why? Please briefly state as follows:</p>
<p>Due to the impact of foreign capitalism, the current Chinese society is moving step by step towards the capitalist ladder. The large cities have already taken shape. Generally speaking, the events in this kind of society have been commercialized. This is the first difficulty caused by reality. Most of our country's universities are gathered in cities. Urban life is expensive. Rent, equipment, and everything else cost a lot. This is the second difficulty. In today's chaotic society, it is not easy for intellectuals to find employment. Most of them can only start schools to find a way out. Therefore, most school founders not only rely on this to maintain their own livelihoods, but also to support their families. There is no other way. This is the third difficulty. Based on these three reasons, the education in our country is becoming increasingly aristocratic, and the methods of collecting fees are increasing day by day. If we only talk about rationalizing the fee payment and popularizing education in this way, it is difficult to achieve in reality. This is why I believe that the theory of a certain gentleman cannot be accepted by ordinary schools at present and can only be achieved in the future society.</p>
<p>But if so, should we not seek another way out? That is definitely not the case! I mean, we can only appropriately increase the education funds in the national treasury, and set up more public schools. In other words, all the party and government officials should quickly realize this, slightly reduce the production of artillery fire that kills their own people, as well as take fewer concubines, buy fewer cars, and prepare their own planes, and transfer the funds to start schools. The most important thing is to restore Jiangwan Labor University.</p>
<p>Labor University was established in 1927, reduced in scope last autumn, and closed down this summer. The treatment of the school was the best in the country. Tuition and food were free. Not to mention, even the students' accommodation during the winter and summer vacations was provided by the school, and there were also uniforms and books to be distributed. In the five years of operation, the students benefited greatly, and the society was even more affected. It is a memorable page in the history of education in our country. It is a pity that the former president, Yi Peiji, managed the school loosely, resulting in few significant achievements, which angered the authorities. Later, Wang Jingqi, a diplomat, took over, but there were repeated disturbances, which led to the closure of the school. Many poor young people wept and hung their heads and were forced to leave the school. This cannot be said to be a fundamental bankruptcy of education in our country, and the authorities intentionally assassinated the youth!</p>
<p>Since the school was closed, there have been many people who coveted to share the large amount of school property left behind, but because of the public's attention, they have not dared to implement it openly for a while. However, if this continues for a long time, even if there is a school property management committee, it will definitely be difficult to avoid being eaten away and gradually become nothing.</p>
<p>Therefore, the restoration of Labor University is an urgent task for the education community in our country, and it is also possible in reality: First, the school property is still there and there is a foundation. Second, restoration is much easier than creation. Moreover, in terms of the social needs of this kind of education, it is even more urgent.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the restoration steps are as follows: (1) Appoint an educator to organize a restoration committee. (2) Appoint a pure educator as the president of the school. (3) Thoroughly liquidate the school property. (4) Repair the part of the school building that has been destroyed by Japanese slaves' artillery fire. (5) Determine the fundamental policy of labor education, with the cultivation of productive technical talents as the main goal, and the management of labor production social talents as the secondary goal. (6) Prepare to restore the school and recruit students. What needs to be paid special attention to here is that the students recruited must be truly poor and unable to attend school.</p>
<p>Last week, the newspaper reported that the education authorities had a restoration plan and that Chu Minyi would be appointed as the president. If this is truly sincere, then the restoration of Labor University may be hopeful, and the flower of labor education may reappear in our desolate society. I hope that our news media and social figures will jointly promote it! What I have said here is just an [index].</p>

<p>— Hengyu</p>
<p>During the first week of classes at ××× University, only foreign professors started teaching on time. The rest began teaching in the second week, with several announcements posted, all saying the same thing: "××× will officially begin classes next week." Afterward, what one often encountered was occasionally going to the school and finding a notice saying: "Professor ××× has an engagement today and will be absent for one day." Thus, people would come from afar only to make a wasted trip. Professors who didn't want their salaries docked came up with the method of making up the classes, which was good, preventing students from losing out on their studies. However, whether students are free during the make-up time is a question. In theory, teachers can make up for classes, and students can also ask teachers to make up for missed classes. I suspect that this may be the way things are done by Professors.</p>
<p>The staff gentlemen are very pretentious, thinking they are ×× chiefs. When you go to ask them about something, they always ignore you, unless it involves money coming in. Just talking about completing enrollment procedures, students had to run to them almost every day for a week after the start of school.</p>
<p>The library is about the same size as the reception room of a shikumen house, displaying a few large dictionaries and magazines and newspapers. There are very few books on academic research. When A class is in session, students taking B class have nowhere to rest and can only gather there to drink tea and chat. The quiet and silent library has turned into a noisy teahouse.</p>
<p>Classes have started. Professor ×, carrying a few hardcover Western books, strides into the classroom very impressively, like turning on a gramophone. He recites a few sentences from his bag of tricks and lectures on a few paragraphs. The students below seem to be listening quietly, but in reality, the boys are sketching his portrait on their notepads, and the girls are writing small notes and passing them around. Finally, Professor × asks: "Any Question?" He senses no response, so he dismisses the class ten minutes before the bell rings. Such tedium makes the wealthy patrons who paid the tuition for this course unhappy to study.</p>
<p>Professor C, in the first class, announced the textbook to be used: "My Textbook is ×××××, the cheapest book for this course, priced at ten × yuan × jiao." After paying fifty or sixty yuan in tuition, there are still forty or fifty yuan in book fees, lecture fees, and miscellaneous fees. Universities are truly made of money. The children of the poor are not welcome. Whether one can find a job paying thirty or forty yuan after graduation is probably still a question.</p>
<p>So-called university education is really like this!</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Mr. Lin was evicted from his house by the second landlord half a month ago. Until today, his entire family has been staying at a friend's house. Originally, this was a very embarrassing thing because bothering people is always uneasy, especially since even the friend is now moving, and he hasn't found his own house yet. Of course, we can imagine how anxious he is. So, he finally discussed it with his wife:</p>
<p>"Hey, we have to find a house today no matter what."</p>
<p>"But where can we find one? A front and back building costs at least twenty yuan, which would take up most of our living expenses, and less than two rooms isn't enough to live in. So, you want it cheap, big, and clean at the same time, so where are you going to find it?"</p>
<p>"But you have to find it, you can't just keep leeching off your friend, can you?"</p>
<p>"Then you go find it, I can't find it."</p>
<p>"Me go find it? Look how shabbily I'm dressed. Before I even walk in the door, the landlords will size me up, either telling you first thing, 'The rent here is very high,' or bluntly replying, 'Already rented out.' As for a man renting a house, they'll ask, 'Do you have a family?' That's simply out of the question, so it's more convenient for you to go."</p>
<p>(Don't tell me I'm not shabbily dressed?)</p>
<p>"But you still have a silk cheongsam, which can at least get you by. Me, in this lined robe that looks like it was dug out of a coffin, I look like a little beggar."</p>
<p>"Don't be so fussy. We're not comparing clothes right now. You have to go once too."</p>
<p>"Sigh, you always get angry when you say that… If there's no way, just rent something a bit more expensive."</p>
<p>"Hahaha, you're just saying things irresponsibly, so full of hot air, you're really a big-eyed pauper. I ask you, if we live in such an expensive house, what will you use to buy rice? What will you use to pay the nanny's wages? It's easy for you to say, but you're so old, you simply don't think things through."</p>
<p>"But, Madam, we have to move out tomorrow, so what else can we do?"</p>
<p>"Then you go try. I've really run around enough in the last half month. It's like 'three pennies for a bowl of soy milk, wanting it full and hot.' I really can't handle this impossible task."</p>
<p>In the end, Mr. Lin dusted off his clothes and shamelessly went to look. Mrs. Lin watched his thin and hunched back disappear.</p>
<p>Finally, Mrs. Lin sat down on the edge of the bed, feeling very distressed. She thought:</p>
<p>"There are people here without houses to live in, while some houses are empty with no one living in them. It's really too unreasonable." She cursed modern society, certain that only with a thorough reform of the current society could one live comfortably.</p>
