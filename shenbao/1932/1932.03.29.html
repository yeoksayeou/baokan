<p>丨紀念黃花崗死難烈士丨</p>
<p>今日爲黃花崗七十二烈士死難二十一度紀念日。同時又恰爲上海禍變爆發後兩週月又一日。在今日。我們試一閉目默念。則黃花崗一役七十二烈士與此次上海禍變中無數忠勇將士爲民族而犧牲之偉大精神。與其亘古不磨之斑爛碧血。當立時活躍於我們的眼前。爲悲壯爲嚴肅。爲偉大崇高。使人欽敬追慕而莫能自已。</p>
<p>我們認爲此一次悲壯的革命行動。在我國革命歷史上是具有偉大意義的一頁。它是斷送專制君主五千年來牢固寳座的一聲霹靂。是推進中國社會轉入一個新階段的一種動力。雖説它還只是以民族觀念爲立脚點而高呼「滅滿興漢」但實際則仍多由西歐資本主義先進國家侵略之刺激與民主思想之鼓盪。有此次悲壯的犧牲。以血與肉呌醒中華民族衰老的靈魂。而後有辛亥革命的爆發。而後幾千年來專制君主的命運。才最後宣告其死刑。所以黃花崗七十二烈士的死。可以謂爲當時時代精神的代表。換言之。他們是恰恰盡完了他們歷史使命。</p>
<p>黃花崗一役的革命運動。爲中國國民黨的先身同盟會所領導。此時國民黨還在艱難奮鬥的程途中。主義的偉力。激發而爲革命的狂潮。我們至今尙可以想見同盟會當日革命的精神。同時我們讀汪精衛題鄒海濱編黃花崗七十二烈士事略的序言。可知當時汪氏還正在北京牢獄現在國民黨已統一全國而爲主政之黨了。汪氏亦已由黨的先鋒。進而爲政治上的領袖了。然而今日的政治。較諸前日究何如。今日的國計民生。較諸前日又何如。外患日亟。山河破碎。撫今追昔。七十二烈士的犧牲。竟換得多少代價。汪氏在「七十二烈士事略」的序言中。曾有「非常傷感非常慚愧」的話。我們想在今日國民黨諸領袖以及汪氏。也許才眞的感到「非常傷感非常慚愧」罷。然而今日之危局。又豈僅「傷感」與「慚愧」所能了事嗎。</p>
<p>在今天我們紀念黃花崗七十二烈士。國民黨諸領袖當更慷慨流涙報告當日奮鬥的悲壯情况。然而我們認爲紀念七十二烈士。在於保持并繼續七十二烈士的革命精神。完成革命的偉業。目前我民族的生命。正爲强權所刦持。危急存亡。間不容髮。一二八禍變以來。我忠勇將士爲維護我民族之生存而犧牲的血跡。斑斑點點。顯示出深重的無限的悲憤。但就目前的情勢言。我們不能不承認一二八以來忠勇將士的血是白流的荒烟蔓草。戰壘宛在。不過又徒供後人之欷嘘憑吊。那麽我們今日正無暇紀念當日的烈事。眼前的事實。也就夠我們默念。更無暇爲七十二烈士哭。民族當前的大難。也就夠我們焦慮。我們今日紀念。正無異於爲我們自己致沉痛的哀忱。唱我們民族的輓歌。</p>
<p>光明在前。鞭兒在後。你古老的民族奮起罷。你呻吟宛轉的弱者奮起罷。不相信一二八的血便是白流的。我們當以更大的犧牲。發揚黃花崗七十二烈士與一二八忠勇將士的光榮。當以更大的努力。推動我民族與社會進入一新的階段。</p>

<p>照中央歷届議案、隴海路係以俄庚欵興築、限五年完成、潼西一段、自去年五月起、即由鐵道部規定在俄庚欵未撥到以前、暫由部每月籌墊若干、先行動工、工程局旋奉命成立、由潼關至華陰二十　公里一段、即開始興築路基、華陰至　　一段、亦經測定路線乃計劃甫定、　　　内風雲忽起、工欵停頓、嗣賴津浦與隴　　本路協助、先後借墊十數萬元、第一段路基、遂得竣工、地價亦已淸發、至其他工事、尙在待欵進行、</p>
<p>潼西段長一百三十一公里、除附近西安有瀝　　二橋工程較鉅外、其餘無大困難、該路工程局爲减抑漏巵起見、所有橋梁、盡量用混凝土拱橋、惟仍須築鋼橋若干、現經估計、其用於國外購辦之橋梁鋼軌機性等、約需六百萬元機車車輛價欵約四百三十萬元、其直接用於國内工程部分者、如地價土工橋洞及舖軌舖碴架橋房屋等用欵、連總務費等約需三百七十餘萬元、共約一千四百萬元左右、若能將外洋材料部分、於各國退還庚欵中、設法周轉墊購、則國内現欵部分月需不過二十餘萬元、</p>
<p>該路除須籌足欵額外、尙須於開工前積極規畫者、乃爲材料之運輸計、潼西段材料、如鋼軌配件·枕木木料·大小橋梁各項機件·及國内採辦之洋灰等共約四萬六千噸、皆須從浦口·大浦·靑島·唐山·各處運至工次、每列料車、以四百噸計算、即須料車一百二十列、假定组織專用料車五列、每列向一千餘公里之路程往返裝運、如無天時人事之阻礙、十天一次、即每月可十五列、須八個月始能勉强運畢各路車輛、本已缺乏、又須顧及營業、故爲便利計、必須先購機車車輛一批、專供運料之用、否則料運为濟、工事即多延誤也、</p>

<p>丨Commemorating the Martyrs of Huanghuagang丨</p>
<p>Today is the twenty-first anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two heroes of Huanghuagang. It also coincides with the two-month and one-day mark since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident. On this day, let us try to close our eyes and silently remember. The great spirit of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang and the countless loyal and brave soldiers who sacrificed for the nation during the Shanghai Incident, and their eternally indelible and brilliant blood, will immediately come to life before our eyes. It evokes sorrow and solemnity, greatness and sublimity, compelling people to admire and yearn without restraint.</p>
<p>We believe that this tragic revolutionary action is a page of great significance in the revolutionary history of our country. It was a thunderbolt that shattered the five-thousand-year-old firm throne of autocratic monarchs and a driving force for China's society to enter a new stage. Although it only took the national concept as its foothold and shouted "Overthrow the Manchus and revive the Han," in reality, it was mostly stimulated by the invasion of advanced capitalist countries in Western Europe and the agitation of democratic ideas. This tragic sacrifice awakened the aging soul of the Chinese nation with blood and flesh, and then came the outbreak of the Xinhai Revolution. Only then was the fate of the autocratic monarchs of thousands of years finally declared its death. Therefore, the death of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang can be said to be the representative of the spirit of the times at that time. In other words, they just completed their historical mission.</p>
<p>The revolutionary movement of the Huanghuagang Uprising was led by the Tongmenghui, the predecessor of the Chinese Kuomintang. At this time, the Kuomintang was still struggling on its difficult journey. The great power of ideology was aroused into a revolutionary upsurge. We can still imagine the revolutionary spirit of the Tongmenghui at that time. At the same time, when we read Wang Jingwei's preface to Zou Haibin's "A Brief Biography of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang," we know that Wang was still in prison in Beijing at that time. Now the Kuomintang has unified the country and become the ruling party. Wang has also progressed from the vanguard of the party to a political leader. However, how is today's politics compared to the past? How is today's national economy and people's livelihood compared to the past? Foreign troubles are becoming increasingly urgent, and the country is fragmented. Reflecting on the present and remembering the past, how much price has the sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs been exchanged for? In the preface to "A Brief Biography of the Seventy-Two Martyrs," Wang once said, "Extremely sad and extremely ashamed." We think that today's leaders of the Kuomintang and Wang may truly feel "extremely sad and extremely ashamed." However, can today's critical situation be resolved merely by "sadness" and "shame"?</p>
<p>Today, as we commemorate the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, the leaders of the Kuomintang should be more generous in shedding tears and reporting the tragic situation of the struggle on that day. However, we believe that commemorating the seventy-two martyrs lies in maintaining and continuing their revolutionary spirit and completing the great cause of the revolution. At present, the life of our nation is being held hostage by powerful forces. The crisis of survival is imminent. Since the January 28th Incident, the bloodstains of our loyal and brave soldiers who sacrificed to safeguard the survival of our nation are speckled and show profound and infinite grief and indignation. However, judging from the current situation, we cannot but admit that the blood of the loyal and brave soldiers since January 28th has been shed in vain, with weeds growing rampant. The battlements are still there, but they only serve as a place for future generations to sigh and pay respects. Then we have no time to commemorate the martyrs of that day. The facts before our eyes are enough for us to remember silently, and we have no time to cry for the seventy-two martyrs. The great disaster facing the nation is enough for us to worry about. Our commemoration today is no different from offering our own condolences and singing the funeral song of our nation.</p>
<p>Light is ahead, and the whip is behind. Arise, you ancient nation. Arise, you weaklings who groan and twist. We do not believe that the blood of January 28th was shed in vain. We should make greater sacrifices to promote the glory of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang and the loyal and brave soldiers of January 28th. We should make greater efforts to push our nation and society into a new stage.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Situation of the Ceasefire Conference Remains Unchanged <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, discussions on the deadline for troop withdrawal in the new draft agreement reached a stalemate. The subcommittee meeting discussed a key point. The general meeting is scheduled to reconvene at 10 a.m. this morning. The formal ceasefire conference was held twice yesterday at the British Consulate General to discuss the new draft ceasefire agreement proposed by the British side. Our side raised the issue of the deadline for the Japanese army to withdraw, but there were no significant results. As for the organization and detailed rules of the Joint Committee, they have all been passed. The general meeting is scheduled to reconvene at 10 a.m. this morning. The military subcommittee also met twice yesterday to discuss the issue of areas adjacent to the concession in the Japanese army's withdrawal procedures, but no concrete decision was made. The official communique stated that a key point has been discussed and needs to be discussed with the chief representatives of both sides, so the meeting will be adjourned today and will continue at 10 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Discussion of the New Draft <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The formal ceasefire conference held its sixth meeting at 10 a.m. yesterday morning and adjourned at 12:30 p.m. The seventh meeting was held at 3 p.m. and adjourned at 5:50 p.m. The attending representatives included Guo Taiqi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, the chief representative of our side, Dai Ji, commander of the Songhu Garrison, the military representative, Ueda Kenkichi, commander of the 9th Division, the chief representative of the Japanese side, Shigemitsu Aoi, the Japanese ambassador, Shimada Shigetaro, Chief of Naval Staff, and representatives of the related countries: British Ambassador Lampson, American Ambassador Johnson, Italian Charge d'Affaires Ciano. French Ambassador Wilder was replaced by Le Grand, the Counselor of the French Embassy. The British side has sorted out and summarized the added clauses or revised wording proposed by all parties during the meeting in recent days during the weekend recess and drafted a new draft ceasefire agreement. Its content is to divide the original three articles into five, but its spirit has not changed at all. After the sixth meeting opened yesterday morning, British Ambassador Lampson presented the new draft and discussed it article by article. Among them, the most important and fundamental points have not been resolved, and it is heard that the opinions of both sides are very different. Our reporter learned last night that the point of contention in the general meeting is still the Japanese army's withdrawal procedures. The so-called withdrawal procedures include one for the retreat location and one for the troop withdrawal deadline. Regarding the location of the Japanese army's retreat, the military subcommittee is still studying it yesterday. What the general meeting discussed yesterday was the troop withdrawal deadline. This point was first raised by Vice Minister Guo yesterday, who advocated that the Japanese army should withdraw completely within a certain deadline and restore the original state before January 28th. The Japanese side expressed that it could not fully agree and only allowed the first step of the Japanese army to retreat to the areas adjacent to the concession, and a deadline could be set in principle. However, the Japanese army could not stipulate a deadline for when to implement the second step of withdrawing from the so-called adjacent areas, saying that it should be determined according to the local situation. Our side refuted this, insisting that the local situation could not be restored until the Japanese army had completely withdrawn. Conversely, if the Japanese army withdrew one day earlier, the local situation could be restored one day earlier. Both sides argued fiercely and discussed repeatedly, but no results were achieved. Yesterday, the Japanese side also requested that Japanese military aircraft be allowed to freely scout our military defense lines. Our side immediately rejected this, saying that this point infringes on our territorial airspace sovereignty and cannot be recognized. As for the verification of the joint troop withdrawal, the Joint Committee is responsible for it, and there is no need to worry about it. Therefore, the Japanese proposal was dropped, just like the issue of plainclothes troops.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Subcommittee <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The military subcommittee also met twice yesterday in another room of the British Consulate General. The first time was from 10 a.m. to 12:15 p.m., and the second time was from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. The representatives were Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army on our side, Tashiro Kanichiro, Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army on the Japanese side, military attachés from the related countries including Sandys Hill of the British Embassy, ​​Traisdale of the American Embassy, ​​Pennavitae of the French Embassy, ​​Fara Ferratini of the Italian Embassy, ​​and Guo Dehua, Secretary of our side, and Abe and Kita, Secretaries of the Japanese side. They still specialized in detailed research on the areas adjacent to the concession where the Japanese army was stationed, but no concrete results were achieved. As for the extent of the discussion, officials only said that a key point had been discussed and needed to be discussed with the chief representatives of both sides. As for its content, all parties kept it secret. Semi-official sources said that the areas adjacent to the concession had been slightly reduced compared to before. It is heard that the Japanese side no longer insisted on Jiangwan Zhabei, but reserved it for Wusong. The area of ​​Jiangwan east of Songhu Road to Zhang Huabang was considered the minimum. However, this information cannot be confirmed. Yesterday at 5 p.m., after the military subcommittee meeting adjourned, the representatives of the related countries retreated, and the Chinese and Japanese representatives went to the general meeting to report. They dispersed about an hour later.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Compilation of Conference Communiques <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(A) The general meeting communique last night stated that the British side integrated the added clauses or revised wording proposed by all parties in recent days at the end of the week and drafted a new draft agreement. After discussion today, several fundamental points have not been resolved, but the organization and detailed rules of the Joint Committee have all been passed, and the meeting will continue at 10 a.m. tomorrow. (B) Military Subcommittee Communique, (1) published yesterday afternoon, said that the subcommittee discussed this morning and continued to discuss this afternoon, with slight progress in the situation. (2) Published last night, said that the subcommittee also met in the afternoon and discussed a key point. Both sides believe that it seems appropriate to discuss it with the chief representatives of each side, so the meeting was adjourned until Wednesday.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Japanese Planes Scouted the Xicheng Jingtai Area Yesterday <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from Wuxi on the 28th said, "At 10 a.m. on the 28th, a Japanese plane arrived, flying high and slowly, scouting for two weeks before leaving."</p>
<p>A telegram from Jiangyin on the 28th said, "At 10:30 a.m. on the 28th, a Japanese plane came again to scout the fortress in Cheng, and left after a quarter of an hour."

<h3 id="e11">Recent Situation of the Japanese Army <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The frontline Japanese army continues to be replenished back and forth. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Temporarily Not Withdrawing Troops The Japanese army first withdrew the 24th Brigade of the 11th Division, which had been fighting for a long time and was exhausted, back to the country, and secretly added two brigades of the army to the front. Recently, the Japanese side has again publicized that it will withdraw troops back to the country for the second time. After careful investigation, this matter is completely inaccurate. Shirakawa has already stated that the Japanese army in Shanghai (including the front and rear) will not withdraw any more troops until the ceasefire conference between China and Japan is resolved. Shirakawa also falsely claimed yesterday that the front line was disturbed by Chinese plainclothes soldiers violating the defense line, so the Japanese army retaliated, and turned to falsely accuse us of starting the war for the Japanese soldiers' invasion of the Chinese soldiers' defense line.</p>
<p>Contact in Jiading On the mornings of the 26th and 27th, the Japanese army on the front line of Jiading attacked our outposts, and were repelled by our army. It was found that the Japanese army failed to attack on the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, the Japanese army changed its plan and used a plainclothes Japanese soldier named Amano who could speak Chinese, leading more than a dozen Japanese sentries and more than a dozen plainclothes soldiers to sneak into our position. Our army learned of this and two armed comrades from the 19th Route Army came out of the trenches to meet them and used grenades to fight. More than twenty Japanese soldiers fled backwards. Amano was wounded by the grenade on the spot and was snatched back by the Japanese soldiers. He died before reaching Jiading.</p>
<p>Wusong is Accessible After our side withdrew from the Wusong Fort, the Japanese army prohibited Chinese people from going there. No one was allowed to visit the fort until yesterday, when the Japanese military headquarters issued a notice saying that those with a pass to the Wusong Fort could go there with proof from the 28th. Those without this pass will still not be allowed to go to the fort.</p>
<p>Chinese People Killed The Japanese army sent troops to guard the Shanghai warehouse of the Japanese merchant Minghua Sugar Factory, and did not allow Chinese people to approach. A few days ago, two workers mistakenly went to the front of the warehouse and were seen by the guarding Japanese soldiers, who opened fire and killed one person on the spot. Another person was heard running away and was also captured by the Japanese army. His whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e12">The Resumption of Business Committee Discussed Opening Methods Yesterday <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Representatives were sent to the Public Concession to ask for protection. The Social Bureau was asked for instructions on settlement issues, etc. The Citizens' United Association and other three groups decided to open the market on April 1 through a joint meeting and organized a Resumption of Business Committee. The first meeting was held yesterday, and it was decided to send representatives to the Public Concession at 10 a.m. today to contact Fessenden to discuss protection issues. The Municipal United Association and the General Association of Business Circles submitted a request to the Social Bureau yesterday for instructions on various issues after the market opens. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e13">Committee Meeting <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The first committee meeting was held at 3 p.m. yesterday. The committee members Zhang Yichen, Hu Fengxiang, Yu Hualong, Qu Zhenhua, Cheng Zhusun, Zhang Xianfang, Wang Jian'e, Zhou Fuzhang, Li Weiliang, and secretaries Ren Jinping and Cao Zhigong attended. Zhang Yichen was publicly elected as the chairman and reported the decisions of the joint meeting. Then the discussion began. (A) How should the market opening procedures be decided? It was resolved that (1) the sub-district associations should all meet on the 31st of this month, (2) all stores should post slogans, and (3) representatives Jiang Junyi, Qu Zhenhua, and Zhou Fuzhang were elected to contact the Concession authorities to protect stores and effectively guarantee the safety of the Hongkou area. (B) How to pay the patrol donation? It was resolved to first collect opinions from the sub-district associations and then discuss it again. (C) How should store rents be handled? It was resolved to investigate the reduction or exemption of rent, which has become a major issue in the city. Before a method of reduction or exemption is decided, rent will be temporarily suspended, and this intention will be submitted to the rent reduction committee of various groups for discussion. (D) The savings plan? It was resolved that the principle of savings was passed. After discussion with various public groups to obtain appropriate methods, savings will begin. (E) How should the issue of reducing or exempting debt repayment be decided? It was resolved to appoint Ren Jinping, Cao Zhigong, Tu Kaizheng, Jiang Junyi, and Yu Hualong to study the methods first and then decide. (F) The letter from the National Salvation Joint Association of various groups, regarding the restriction of the entertainment industry and the drawing of donations for the opening of the market? It was resolved to reply to the letter.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Asking for Instructions <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Citizens' United Association and the General Association of Business Circles submitted a request to the Municipal Social Bureau yesterday, saying, "This is a report on the resolution to open the market with pain, requesting your review and approval. The association received your bureau's instructions on March 21, opening (omitted in the middle), etc. Therefore, the association considers this matter to be of great importance and specially invited the members of the two associations and the representatives of the French Concession Business Association to hold a joint meeting on March 27. All agreed that the stores in the city had violated international law before because the Japanese soldiers invaded the border, so they went on strike to resist the enemy. Unexpectedly, the incident has become increasingly serious, and the Japanese soldiers' various acts of disregarding justice and fairness have become even more intensified. The number of innocent civilians who have died is countless. Moreover, after our army respected the resolution of the League of Nations Investigation Mission and retreated to the second line of defense, they occupied our country's territory and wantonly trampled on it. All merchants and people in the city are in a state of grief and terror every day. They cannot live in peace, and there is no way to enjoy their work. In terms of reason and situation, it is impossible to open the market rashly. However, in order to respect the advice of the League of Nations Investigation Mission, the government's long-term resistance strategy, and to stabilize the rear and regulate finance, we have no choice but to open the market with pain for the country and to show that the government and the people are in step, and to avoid being taken advantage of by those who sow discord. Therefore, it was unanimously decided to open the market with pain on April 1. However, Shanghai's commerce has suffered various difficulties in trade and finance due to this incident, and how should rent be reduced or exempted, how should accounts be settled, and how can finance be regulated and stabilized, and how can the rear be truly stabilized? All of these are problems to be solved. In addition to the association organizing a committee to study it in detail, we still hope that your bureau will give instructions for guidance so that we can follow them. All the details of the resolution to open the market with pain should be reported to your bureau, requesting your review and approval, and requesting instructions for compliance."</p>
<h3 id="e15">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Again Urges the Opening of the Market <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement yesterday to urge various industries to open the market again, saying, "Dear Sirs, on the 27th of this month, the Cotton Cloth Industry, the Electrical Appliance Industry, the Paper Industry, the Silk Satin Industry, the Seafood Industry, the Jute Bag Cloth Industry, the Flying Flower Industry, the Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, the North-South Goods Exchange Industry, the New Medicine Industry, the Sugar Industry, and other trade associations jointly sent a letter saying, "At the beginning of the strike to resist the enemy, the original intention was to express enemy hatred, but it is not possible to control the enemy by striking. Our government has repeatedly declared long-term resistance, and our people should make long-term preparations economically so that the national treasury is full and the people's strength is abundant in order to implement the long-term resistance. Shanghai is the center of the national industry and commerce, and the foundation of the national economic lifeline. If we strike for a long time, how is it different from abandoning our economic strength and being taken advantage of by the enemy? Your association once announced that the market would open on March 1, but due to the different views of a few citizens, it could not be universally followed. When your association called for a strike, it printed a simple announcement and distributed it to various stores to post, but there was no such announcement for the opening of the market, except for publishing it in the newspaper, so that every household would know it. It is also one of the reasons why it could not be unified. For the sake of the present, the strike cannot be delayed for a long time, and the opening of the market should be strived for unity. It seems that your association should print a simple announcement for the opening of the market and distribute it to various stores to post so that everyone knows about it and can follow it. After the war, the local vitality has not recovered, and business has been suspended for two months. How to deal with debts and credits, how to manage goods and rent, should be calculated by your association as a whole and planned in detail to gradually remedy the situation so that industry and commerce can be stable in business and prepare for the economic long-term resistance of the country. We hereby send this letter to your association for your reference and handling." The association examined the fact that the Shanghai market was affected by the suspension of business and had decided to extend the total settlement to the end of May. How to manage rent, the association had submitted a request to the municipal government to preside over the decision based on the requests for rent reduction from various industries. How should we plan in detail and supplement the plan in the future? We are still continuing to plan so as not to disappoint the entrustment of the merchants. In addition to issuing a separate simple announcement regarding the uniform opening of the market, we hereby send a letter for your reference and handling. The simple announcement is also recorded below: In order to reduce unemployment panic, activate local finance, restore national treasury tax revenue, and increase the strength of long-term resistance, all stores and factories in the safe zone that have not yet opened the market or started business should follow the association's March 1 announcement and open the market and resume business uniformly.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Women's Circles Regarding the League of Nations Investigation Team's Recommendations <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Letter from the Shanghai Women's Association, the Shanghai Women's National Salvation League, the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association, the Shanghai Women's Suffrage Association, the Shanghai Women's Rights Movement Association, the Shanghai Women's Temperance Society, and the Shanghai Women's Association to the League of Nations Investigation Team: To the esteemed members of the League of Nations Investigation Committee, your delegation has come to uphold justice in the Sino-Japanese dispute, and the women's organizations of Shanghai extend a most sincere welcome. In order to provide your delegation with reference materials, we hereby present a brief account of the tragic consequences since the Japanese army's undeclared war, along with our opinions.</p>
<p>It is universally known that war is fierce and dangerous. The undeclared war, however, has caused many innocent civilians to perish in surprise attacks without warning. The horror and fear of this situation is perhaps beyond your delegation's imagination. All these tragic marks will be even more deeply understood after your delegation personally visits the war zone; we need not dwell on them. Our association, as a representative of Chinese women, wishes to solemnly express to your delegation our feelings and hopes, and for the sake of safeguarding world peace, we also have suggestions to offer, which we pray you will consider. We earnestly hope that your delegation's mission will be fully accomplished, and that the League of Nations' work of ending war and establishing peace will succeed soon, so that the principles of public reason and justice upon which the world depends will not be destroyed by violence. Therefore, the sincerity and enthusiasm of the Chinese people's willingness to cooperate with your delegation are no less than that of your delegation with the great powers. Although we regret that the League of Nations was unable to devise a friendly and fair solution before the Shanghai Incident occurred, we still firmly believe that the League of Nations will ultimately maintain its perseverance and find a way out of the difficult and complex situation. There is no doubt about this. At the same time, however, we insist on complete economic severance with Japan, as this action is in line with the spirit of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, and its implementation is what we most desire to see. The Sino-Japanese dispute is due to Japan's aggression, so if Japan does not abandon or repent, the war will not end. We are not afraid of the Japanese slaughter in fighting for humanity and justice. Japan has exhausted its arsenal of weapons in Shanghai, such as cannons, tanks, machine guns, and all the military equipment used in modern warfare. As a result, during the month-long war, the sound of heavy artillery was deafening, and the devastation of burning was appalling. Day and night, wanton devastation resulted in unspeakable tragedy. However, we, the women who survive, mindful of the brutality of Japan's methods and the peril of Chinese culture, will still spare no effort and persevere to the end. It must be understood that the Chinese nation, although it has experienced many changes in history, has always been able to stand tall. At this critical moment of China's survival, we have repeatedly declared that we will never submit to force. Therefore, no matter what means Japan or the central government uses, they cannot force us to buy Japanese goods. If there are other tools in the world besides boycotts that can sanction aggressors, the League of Nations must advocate them, and we will gladly follow. Moreover, our boycott is not narrowly defined; it is not only for China. We are willing to extend our sympathy and boycott to any country that unfortunately falls into our plight. Did not a Westerner, Gibbon, say, "Among animals, only the feminine is the most enduring"? This is no exaggeration. We know that your delegation will not dwell on the indirect reasons related to the Manchurian case in order to avoid hindering its progress. However, we must tell you that Japan's aggression in Manchuria and the undeclared wars in Tianjin and Shanghai are all the result of a consistent policy of aggression. Therefore, the occupation of Manchuria is only the beginning. What troubles China today may trouble the world in the future. For this reason, our government trusts the League of Nations, hoping that it can quickly fulfill its sacred duty. We humbly believe that when your delegation conducts its investigation, it must thoroughly collect the feelings, opinions, and demands of our people, as well as Japan's ardent warmongering policy, which is increasingly inflated and poses a crisis that could shake the world.</p>
<p>What is the most urgent task for the world to accomplish? It is to implement the League of Nations Covenant and the articles restricting aggression, to hold member states accountable for mutual respect of the territorial integrity and administrative independence of other countries. If not, Japan will become stronger, and when further aggression is possible, can the affairs of the world still be questioned? At this time, when the world's calamity has arrived, it is difficult to easily say that it can be reversed. It is difficult to easily say that it can be reversed. Therefore, we dare not but sincerely hope that your delegation will establish a foundation for justice, so that we can have something to rely on and further seek the happiness of the world. Then China will be fortunate, and the future of world peace will be fortunate.</p>

<p>April 1st. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency yesterday met with Wu Jingxiong, the Chinese advisor to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and inquired about the date for the lifting of martial law in the concessions. According to him, this matter was discussed at yesterday's meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and it is expected to be implemented on April 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Japanese Military Dissatisfied with Government Diplomacy <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reports that regarding the Sino-Japanese armistice negotiations in Shanghai, due to the significant distance between the points of contention on both sides, matters that cannot be resolved in the preparatory meeting will be transferred to the formal meeting for discussion. The military believes that entering the formal meeting will only prolong the process, and a satisfactory solution is feared to be extremely difficult. Citing the precedent of the Sino-Russian Conference, they strongly criticize the government's inappropriate diplomacy. They believe that the participation of the League of Nations and third countries is mostly unfavorable to Japan, while China indirectly receives assistance through the sympathy of the United Kingdom and the United States. They are greatly dissatisfied with this "father-son diplomacy" of Inukai and Yoshizawa.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Northwest Airlines to Open on Schedule <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation, in order to establish Northwest Airlines, sent its first Eurasia aircraft to fly from Pingjin (Beiping/Tianjin) to Luoyang and Xi'an, with good results.

Flights will be suspended on Mondays, Saturdays, and Sundays. On all other days, flights will depart every morning at 7:00 AM. The aircraft can carry four passengers, and the mail capacity is up to 400 kilograms. As for the China-Europe connecting flight, the company will decide based on the circumstances after the opening of the initial line. Soon, it will be extended to Dihua (Ürümqi) in Xinjiang and the border between Xinjiang and Soviet Russia. The timetable, passenger fares, and flight distances set by the company are excerpted below:</p>

<h3 id="e23">Expansion Plans <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation is jointly established by the Ministry of Communications and the German National Aviation Company. From the beginning, the aim was to open an air route between China and central Europe to facilitate postal transport. In the past, due to the obstruction of the air route in Russia, it has not yet been opened. Now the company will first open domestic routes. Because transportation in Northwest China is difficult, travel is difficult, and the delivery of postal correspondence takes a long time, the company is focusing on domestic mail transport and developing Xinjiang. Xinjiang, in the far west, has the most obstacles in transportation. Therefore, after opening the routes between Beijing, Xi'an, and Beiping, the company plans to expand flights to Xinjiang.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Real Estate Association Discussed Post-War Rent and Insurance Issues Yesterday <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Proposed Measures Submitted to the General Meeting for Decision. The Municipal Real Estate Association held its 15th meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from Yongqing Company, Jinxing Company, Central Trust Company, Gu Lanji, Qiu Chengqitang, Longzhang Company, Hengfeng Accounting Firm, Jiuxing Company, Taily Company, Hengyufeng Real Estate Company, Huada Company, Zhou Gengji, Yinyu Company, Changfeng Company, Hengye Company, Xinghe Company, Derun Company, World Bookstore, Hexing Company, Tongde Company, Renxin Company, Yizhong Company, Zhenhua Company, Jinsheng Company, and others, including Ye Shantao, Shen Zhifang, Gui Yanfang, Tao Rangqing, and over sixty others, attended. Gui Yanfang was elected as chairman and reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, the meeting discussed the rent issues in the war zone, the Public Concession, the French Concession, Pudong, and the Nanshi, as well as property insurance issues in the war zone. After a long period of research, the meeting provisionally proposed measures concerning social economy and scheduled a general meeting to make a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Opinions of Various Groups in the French Concession on Rent Reduction <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The various commercial associations in the French Concession, including Nanyang Bridge, Tangjiawan, the Western District, Xujiahui, New Western District Twelfth Road, Minguo Road, Avenue Edward VII, and the Vegetable Market Street, have recently been affected by the situation, and many shops have been closed for a long time. Although the shops on each road have gradually resumed business in recent days, the market is depressed and no longer what it used to be. Therefore, most of the member shops of these associations have suggested reducing or exempting rent to maintain the status quo. After several meetings and discussions, the associations have come to the following conclusions on the rent reduction measures, based on the two major principles in the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's announcement: (1) Advise landlords to voluntarily reduce rent; (2) Tenants pay off outstanding rent. However, the situation in the French Concession is different. The original rents for newly built houses in various places are actually higher than in other places. Therefore, even before the war, there were discussions about rent reduction. For example, after negotiations, the rents for newly built houses on Avenue Joffre have been reduced by 30% or 10-20% of the original rent. However, other newly built houses have not been rented out to this day. For example, in places such as Nanyang Bridge Huacheng Fang, only one or two out of ten houses have been rented out since the completion of construction. Most of them are vacant because the original rent is too high and the tips are too large. Therefore, rent reduction or exemption must be carefully considered and handled separately. Currently, the associations advocate reducing rent collection but not reducing the Shanghai Municipal Council's taxes to avoid misunderstandings from the authorities. On one hand, they will first solicit public opinion. After collecting public opinion, each commercial association, each neighborhood house association, and representatives of landlords will jointly form a "French Concession Rent Reduction and Exemption Committee." All matters concerning whether rent should be reduced in each place and the amount of rent reduction will be reviewed and decided by the committee. After obtaining the consent of the relevant landlords, the committee will verify and implement the decision to avoid unfortunate disputes, so that landlords and tenants can resolve peacefully.</p>

Yan Shenyu chaired the meeting, and Hu Gongshou recorded the minutes. First, the chairman stood up to report that the establishment meeting of the Defense Committee was held today. The county had previously established a Defense Committee in accordance with the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Defense Corps Act. Now, following the provincial order, the new regulations have been promulgated to reorganize the committee. Today, the committee is established. Although the establishment of defense corps in various districts of the county has a considerable history, based on past observations, the defense corps in various districts do not have unified methods, and the regulations for the defense corps have not been fully implemented. Now that the county Defense Committee has been reorganized and established, it should unify the affairs of the defense corps throughout the county and do it practically. It should also proceed step by step according to the regulations of the charter.

<p>The Shanghai Entertainers' Union built the Liyuan Villa in Yangjia Bridge, Zhenru, specifically for the burial of poor and deceased entertainers. The land area is about 20 mu, and the Entertainers' Home for the Elderly is attached to it. When the Shanghai Incident occurred, the Japanese forces attempted to destroy the radio station and repeatedly dropped bombs from airplanes. The people in the home were terrified and could not live there for a day. The elderly people in the home repeatedly requested the Entertainers' Union to find a way to relocate. Although the executive committee repeatedly discussed the relocation of the home, it was always suspended due to the military zone and dangerous transportation. Recently, it was learned that Japanese soldiers frequently searched the home, and the elderly people could not bear the harassment. Therefore, they decided to request the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association Rescue Team to provide assistance. The chairman of the Relief Association appointed team members Wu Guirong, Wang Peinan, and Shao Ronggen to accompany Pan Hongxun, a member of the Entertainers' Union, in a rescue vehicle at 8:30 AM on March 27th to rescue the eight elderly people out of danger. The team encountered obstacles from Japanese soldiers while traveling through Fanwangdu, Zhongshan Road, and other places. Fortunately, team member Wu Guirong handled it properly, so they arrived safely at the temporary residence of the association in Nine Acres at 11:30 AM. They will be relocated again after the situation is calm.</p>

<p>The Huai Sheng Midwifery School for Women and the Huai Lü Nursing Home on Beinicheng Bridge, Aiwenyi Road, Shanghai, organized many Red Cross military hospitals since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident. Recently, in view of the urgent need for relief for refugee pregnant women in various shelters, Zhou Weishi, Cai Futang, Zheng Zhongshan, and other directors of the hospital, as well as people from all walks of life and philanthropists, donated huge sums to set up a temporary refugee maternity hospital specializing in accommodating refugee pregnant women. If any full-term pregnant women are found in various shelters, they can call the hospital (90274), and the hospital will send a car to pick them up for delivery. In addition to free hospitalization, baby clothes are also provided as gifts. In recent days, there have been many cases of women in labor sent by various charitable organizations, and they have all had safe deliveries, which is truly commendable.</p>

<p>The villagers from various places such as Jiading, Taicang, and Huangdu fled to Shanghai in droves due to the harassment of Japanese soldiers. They gathered in Xinjing and Caojiadu in northwestern Shanghai and were successively transported to Shanghai by trucks dispatched by the War Zone Refugee Relief Association to be placed in various shelters. Later, as the peace talks progressed and the situation eased, the number of villagers fleeing to the Caojiadu area gradually decreased. It had completely disappeared in the past three or four days. However, yesterday (28th) starting at 8:00 AM, the villagers fleeing to Caojiadu and other places surged again. By 1:00 PM, there were more than 200 people gathered in the Wujiaochang area of the town. It is reported that these villagers are all from Zhu Zhai, Hua Cao, and other places. Because Japanese soldiers have been firing and provoking challenges in recent days, with stray bullets flying everywhere, they had no choice but to flee to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Association's repatriation division has been registering refugees returning to their hometowns in recent days and has been successively repatriating them to various ports along the Yangtze River. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the association's rescue division went to Caojiadu, Fanwangdu, and other areas yesterday (27th) and rescued 757 refugees by truck. In addition to 30 people from the 29th boarding house who were given tickets to be repatriated to Zhenjiang, 10 people to Hankou, 20 people to Nanjing, 10 people to Jiujiang, 20 people to Wuhu, and 10 people to Anqing, a total of 100 people, the rest were sent to Shanghai College Fourth Hospital and the boarding houses on Laobosheng Road and Wuding Road for accommodation. In addition, the 27th boarding house of the association received over 200 sets of single clothing donated by the Chinese and Western faculty and staff of Xuhui Public School yesterday and personally distributed them to the refugees. It is reported that the association has sent a special letter of thanks.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Relief Factory for Jiangxi Refugees <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jiangxi Guild Hall's refugee shelter has sent more than 2,000 refugees back to their hometowns. Now it has received more than 300 refugees, and those registering are still streaming in every day. Most of the refugees in the shelter are from the working class. Because bandits in their hometowns prevent them from returning, there are still more than 7,000 unemployed people outside. In view of this situation, the shelter has established a relief factory to first set up departments for manufacturing military iron beds, wooden beds, wooden boxes, tea boxes, and palm mattresses so that the workers can make a living and not just sit around and eat. The shelter sincerely hopes that various social groups and businesses will provide assistance, promote sales, and combine work with revitalization. On the one hand, it can reduce the number of unemployed people in Shanghai, and on the other hand, it can help revitalize industry and subsidize society, which is of great benefit and is not just a partial problem for the Jiangxi people in Shanghai.</p>

<p>An Elderly Man Was Outside the Door: It Turned Out to Be a Kidnapping of a Weak Girl</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a young man in his twenties suddenly arrived at the Shanghai War Zone Refugee Temporary Relief Society, bringing with him a maiden of fourteen. They claimed to be from Anhui province, and that the girl was his younger sister. They said they had fled from the Zhabei war zone and were stranded outside, intending to apply to the society for free tickets to return to their hometown by boat. However, the society's staff found their attire and language to be different and not resembling siblings at all. They separated the two for strict questioning, and it was revealed that the girl was from Danyang and the man had met her along the way, not knowing her before. The man then admitted that the girl was not his younger sister, but claimed he was acting on his father's orders to bring her to receive free boat tickets. When the society's staff asked where his father was, he said he was waiting outside. The staff went out to investigate and found an elderly man with white hair leaning against the door. They brought him into the society and questioned him, and he replied that the young man was his neighbor, not his son, and was evasive, refusing to tell the truth. The society, finding the situation bizarre and suspecting a kidnapping of a weak girl, detained them for investigation.</p>

<p>Tenants Benefit Twice: Disaster Victims Gain Significantly</p>
<p>Philanthropist Mr. Pan Shoren, one of Shanghai's leading real estate tycoons, independently established a refugee shelter at 230 Kang Nao Tuo Road after the January 28th Incident, housing nearly a thousand disaster victims. Now, to ensure long-term accommodation for the victims, he voluntarily proposed donating all rental income from his properties, amounting to tens of thousands of yuan per month, to the shelter. The method is for tenants to voluntarily pay their rent to the Kang Nao Tuo Road shelter, which will issue receipts. Tenants can use these receipts to exchange for rent tickets at Mr. Pan's rental agency. This method will be implemented monthly until the shelter closes, at which point the rental agency will collect rent directly. It is a well-rounded approach that benefits both parties. This city has no shortage of landlords and businessmen. If they could all promote this idea, the disaster victims would benefit greatly.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Coal and Stone Lightermen's Association submitted a letter to the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating: "According to reports from our members, the road materials used by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession are sourced from Hangzhou Zhangshan. For the past two years, Shishunji Sand and Stone Company has been contracted through bidding to supply materials annually and has signed a contract with the Municipal Council, hiring our members' lighters to transport them. Traditionally, the water freight rate has been $1.60 per ton, but now the contractor is taking advantage of the national crisis to pay only $1.10 per ton, deducting a substantial $0.50. After paying various taxes and levies, it is impossible to cover expenses, but it is not for business purposes, but how can the livelihoods of thousands of unemployed workers be maintained? We request that measures be taken for relief." The association added, "At this critical time of national crisis, it is essential for all sectors to unite and work together to overcome the difficulties, with particular attention to the livelihoods of workers. For the sake of social stability, the association has already notified its members to endure the hardship. However, the contractor is taking the opportunity to profit, deducting $0.50 per ton, which is deliberately disrupting the market and endangering the nation's foundation. In light of the above, we have sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce requesting a warning. We are also submitting this letter to your bureau, requesting that you order Shi Wanchang to consider the national crisis and the livelihoods of unemployed workers, and continue to pay at the original price to avoid disputes." It is also reported that the association is scheduled to convene a meeting at the Shanghai South Office at 10 a.m. on the 30th of this month to discuss countermeasures.</p>

<p>Seeking Freedom and Equality Does Not Mean Anti-Foreign Sentiment; Respect for Treaties Is Demonstrable; The Boycott Movement Is Entirely Provoked by Aggression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At noon on the 28th, Premier Wang hosted a banquet for the League of Nations Investigation Team and delivered the following speech: "Ladies and Gentlemen, you have come to China on an important mission from the League of Nations. On behalf of the government, I extend my boundless respect. You have come to investigate the Sino-Japanese Incident. After arriving in Shanghai, you have not hesitated to travel to the Shanghai area to inspect the battlefields. The destruction inflicted by the Japanese army, navy, and air force on the Chinese people and land, all cultural and economic constructions, have been reduced to ashes by aircraft bombs and heavy artillery shells. Refugees fleeing from gunfire and artillery shells, wandering without a home, students losing their education, workers losing their jobs, and social problems becoming more serious. As for the families of those who died in the war, the orphans and widows, the scenes of desolation are everywhere. This is a true picture of the war in Shanghai since January 28th, which the Japanese aggression has caused, which you have personally witnessed and heard. As for the situation in the Northeast, one can imagine it. Ladies and gentlemen, China and Japan are both member states of the League of Nations and have the obligation to abide by the League of Nations Covenant to ensure peace and prevent war. Now, unfortunately, acts of war have actually occurred between the two countries. I solemnly declare today that the Chinese side bears no responsibility whatsoever for the occurrence of these acts of war. The Chinese side was forced to resort to legitimate self-defense because of continuous attacks by Japan. Since the Japanese army invaded and occupied the Northeast on September 18th last year, China has abided by the obligations of a member state of the League of Nations and has entrusted this major incident to the League of Nations. China has sincerely accepted all resolutions of the League of Nations Council, but Japan has flagrantly violated the resolutions of the League of Nations Council. Recently, it has even trampled on the Southeast with its land, sea, and air forces. The resolution of the League of Nations Special Assembly this month is not even worth a glance. Therefore, the Japanese side is not only the destroyer of China's territorial sovereignty but also the destroyer of the League of Nations Covenant. I now represent the government, conveying to you the hopes and aspirations of the Chinese people. The National Government follows the will of the Premier of the Chinese Kuomintang and strives for China's freedom and equality. The so-called seeking of China's freedom and equality is entirely different from anti-foreignism. China's freedom and equality are necessary conditions for the survival of the Chinese state and nation. China sincerely disclosed these demands at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, and then disclosed them at the Washington Conference the following year. Later, during the years 1925 and 1926, when the government of the Chinese Kuomintang and the National Revolutionary Army it organized set out from Guangzhou to unify the country, these demands were fully expressed because these are conditions that any country must have for its survival, and its meaning is definitely not anti-foreignism. I must ask you to pay attention to this point. China not only has no anti-foreign meaning, but also respects and maintains all treaties concluded with various countries. China certainly has the demand to abolish unequal treaties, but China has absolutely no intention of unilaterally abolishing them. China deeply knows that the abolition of unequal treaties and the signing of equal treaties are not only needed for China's survival but also have common interests with the countries concerned, and the countries will certainly be able to provide assistance. I will now give an example to prove this. This time, Japan invaded Shanghai, using the Public Concession as a landing point for troops and as a base of operations. This was extremely detrimental to China's defense, but China, out of respect for treaties, has never been willing to harm the safety of the Public Concession. When the Japanese army fired on the Chinese army from behind the Public Concession, the Chinese army, fearing damage to the concession, did not even return fire. From this example, the degree of patience of the Chinese government and its people can be seen. Ladies and gentlemen, you come from Japan, or you may have heard that the Chinese people have anti-Japanese acts, such as boycotting Japanese goods, etc. I now add that these facts of the Chinese people are provoked by Japan's acts of aggression against China. For example, in 1915, Japan forced China to sign the Twenty-One Demands with a harsh ultimatum, which caused the Chinese people to boycott Japanese goods. The Jinan Incident in 1928 was also the same. Since September 18th last year, the Chinese people's aversion to Japan has increased with Japan's acts of aggression. If you want to eliminate these anti-Japanese facts, the only effective method is for Japan to eliminate its acts of aggression, because the Chinese people originally had no intention of being anti-Japanese. The hopes and aspirations of the Chinese people for the current situation are the integrity of territory and sovereignty. Therefore, they regard the recent emergence of a puppet government in the Northeast as the same tactic used by Japan to destroy Korea and cannot tolerate it. As for engaging in economic development in the Northeast, the Chinese people will be happy to join hands with friendly countries, and their hope to have peace to achieve their development is no different from the desire of friendly countries to maintain commerce. Now, you have come to China on an important mission from the League of Nations to investigate. I am deeply pleased to have this opportunity to offer my views for your reference and am willing to do my best to assist you in completing this important task. I respectfully raise a glass to wish you success in achieving justice and peace, and I wish you all good health!" (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Luo Wengan's Speech <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Our Country Has Always Adopted a Peaceful Attitude; It Cannot Change the Neighboring Country's Acts of Aggression; We Hope to Solve the Current Situation with Fair Measures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo hosted a banquet for the League of Nations Investigation Team at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center at 8 p.m. on the 28th and delivered a welcome speech: "Gentlemen, you represent the highest authority in the world (the League of Nations). As the head of the Ministry, I now welcome you on behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China. I am very pleased. At the beginning of this incident, we immediately appealed to the League of Nations, firmly believing that all countries would provide us with a guarantee of justice. For the League of Nations Council and the General Assembly's tireless efforts to ease this dispute or reduce the scope of the incident, I deeply believe that I can take this opportunity to clearly express China's gratitude. In particular, we cannot forget the sudden death of a great politician who once served as the chairman of the League of Nations Council, which aroused the mourning of the entire French people and the sympathy of mankind. Your visit to China is appropriate at the most tragic period in Chinese history. When you left Europe, the development of the incident in the East had already endangered the integrity of Chinese territory. Subsequently, Japan's military actions in Shanghai further endangered the foundation of Chinese society and political organization. You all know that since the declaration of the Republic of China, we have been trying to adapt to modern political and social concepts, hoping for peaceful and gradual development. China can make a full contribution to the prosperity and progress of the world. Our country fully understands that there are many difficulties in the future of this cause. In a vast country, with nearly one-fifth of the world's population, coupled with inconvenient transportation and other reasons, the efforts of the intellectual class for the people have been delayed and less effective. China's political and administrative organization is different from that of your country. All of China's great undertakings to lead and develop the republican system are extremely difficult. Therefore, various obstacles are inevitable. We sometimes have to try new experiments to promote the realization of our new ideals. But at least we hope that there will be no external dangers and that we will receive the sympathy and assistance of various countries, especially the sympathy and assistance of neighboring countries with adjacent territories, so that we can continue our efforts. While we are trying to resolve various difficulties and obstacles, unexpectedly a neighboring country attacked our country with military force without prior notice and without resorting to the methods of peaceful resolution of international disputes stipulated in international law and the treaties jointly signed by China and Japan. First, it attacked our East, then Tianjin, and then invaded Shanghai. We had originally hoped to cooperate with him sincerely based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, and respect for sovereign independence, but we did not expect him to take such extraordinary actions. We are the most peace-loving country, so from the beginning, we adopted the most peaceful attitude, hoping to change his aggressive actions with our peaceful attitude. Unexpectedly, this kind of hope has all become empty talk. When you were in Shanghai this time, you should have been able to collect appropriate information about the Shanghai incident since January 28, and use your fair eyes to estimate the suffering of the general peaceful and innocent people. In order to protect our territory, we have resisted the aggressors and will continue to resist for the sake of self-defense. But we deeply desire peace and are willing to establish any fair method based on the League of Nations resolutions and existing treaties to resolve the current situation. We have great faith in the results of your investigation and your recommendations to the League of Nations. We know that you have a spirit of impartiality and selflessness, and we will provide as much material and information as possible for the investigation. We will never hide anything and firmly believe that frankness and selflessness are the best ways to show the justice of our position. I respectfully raise a glass to wish you good health and the success of your mission!" (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>The League of Nations Will Naturally Maintain International Credit; It Will Never Violate the Principle of Territorial Integrity</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sir Lytton, Chairman of the League of Nations Investigation Team, replied in English on behalf of all the commissioners at Premier Wang's banquet. First, he expressed the Investigation Team's gratitude for the generous hospitality of the Chinese government. Later, he stated briefly that the League of Nations itself has the responsibility to maintain its international credit. The Chinese government has always trusted the League of Nations since the Sino-Japanese incident occurred, and the League of Nations has also expressed its sympathy. Moreover, I (Lytton referring to himself) dare to say that the League of Nations will handle this incident without violating the principle of destroying the administrative independence and territorial integrity of any country. If there is any violation of this principle, the League of Nations will never recognize it, etc. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Gu Weijun told reporters that the League of Nations Investigation Team stayed in Shanghai for twelve days and paid great attention to the opinions presented by all sectors of our country. The impression was very good. The government plans to have a complete memorandum, with various evidences of Japanese aggression against China, and will submit it to the Investigation Team in the coming days. The commissioners of the Investigation Team also want to have a formal discussion with our country's authorities in the coming days to ask our government to express its views as much as possible to clarify the crux of the Sino-Japanese problem. When the reporter inquired about the prospects for the Shanghai Armistice Conference, Gu replied that he was ordered to receive the League of Nations Investigation Team, and he was not very clear about the inside story of the Armistice Conference. The future is difficult to be optimistic. If the other party realizes the tragic nature of human slaughter, it should meet each other quickly with sincerity, and do not delay the time in vain.

<p>Beiping Plans Reception Procedures, Welcome Train Heads South to Await Orders (Nanjing) Lord Lytton's secretary, Astoo, arrived in Beijing by plane this morning from Shanghai and is also staying at the Military Moral Endeavor Society. Political and journalistic circles are now unanimously and vigorously opposing the Japanese request that the investigation team first go to Hankou and Guangzhou, and then to the Northeast. They insist that the investigation team go to the Northeast immediately to investigate the situation there, saying that this case has been pending since last September and should not be delayed further. The sole purpose of the Japanese application is to prolong the investigation team's work in the Northeast as long as possible. Whether the investigation team should go to Hankou is now one of the main issues under discussion by the members. It is said that this question will be decided tomorrow morning when Secretary Haas arrives in Beijing from Shanghai. This afternoon, the members met with President Wang, Foreign Minister Luo, and Dr. Gu at the Ministry of Railways to exchange views on Sino-Japanese issues. It is reported that the investigation team considered abandoning the plan to go north via Hankou during the talks. The members held an informal meeting at the Military Moral Endeavor Society at 5:00 PM this afternoon. The members of the investigation team are scheduled to meet with Chairman Lin at 11:00 AM tomorrow morning. (28th Day Reuters)</p>

<p>Stations Attacked Frequently, Former Employees Continue to Demand Arrears (Harbin) The situation on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway is worsening. Several stations are attacked daily by Ding Chao's army or irregular troops. Many employees are being robbed and kidnapped. The authorities have not taken any protective measures. The Russian authorities seem determined to maintain a neutral attitude regarding the operation of the eastern section, disregarding the lives and deaths of individuals. Perhaps the Russian employees believe that the responsibility for protecting the railway and its employees lies with the Chinese government. If the railway is repeatedly attacked and unable to operate, Russia may then advocate using Russian troops to guard the railway. If so, the question of whether Japan will approve will likely arise. (28th Day Reuters)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The issue of arrears owed to former employees of the Chinese Eastern Railway has not been satisfactorily resolved.

After the representatives returned, they convened a meeting of former employees. The meeting participants decided to reject it, considering it another empty promise, and decided to send representatives to Changchun to request assistance because negotiations with the president and vice president of the railway were ineffective.

Because traitors and bandits attacked the rear, Commander Wu was injured in the leg and lacked ammunition, so he retreated to Faku. It is estimated that the 700-plus troops of Liu Hai and Shi's units of our 18th and 19th Armies clashed with the Wang Dianzhong and Li Shoushan units of the Provisional First Brigade of the puppet Fengtian Army at Feiniutun, east of Shenyang.

<p>The League of Nations is Not Anxious About the News, Threatening Tactics are Frequently Heard (National News Agency, Geneva, 27th) After news arrived here that Japan had released information that if the League of Nations insisted on implementing several resolutions regarding the Manchurian incident, Japan would withdraw from the League of Nations, people in the League of Nations were largely bewildered and confused. The Chinese, however, claimed that Japan was deliberately releasing information in an attempt to scare off the League of Nations investigation team. Many member states of the League of Nations said that the resolution of the March 10th General Assembly and the previous resolutions of the Council clearly stated that the League of Nations wanted to investigate the Manchurian situation and obtain detailed reports. When the Japanese representative Sato asked whether this case applied to Manchuria, Secretary-General Drummond must have clearly told him. However, League of Nations leaders did not show any anxiety upon hearing this news, because such news from Tokyo was often contradictory and had been heard frequently, so they generally believed that Japan's constant complaining at this time was sufficient to clearly indicate that Japan also deeply knew the fundamental legitimacy of the League of Nations' position. The Chinese delegation has received reports that peace negotiations in Shanghai on Saturday were progressing more smoothly, so all parties are hoping that the Shanghai troop withdrawal agreement can be negotiated directly between China and Japan without the League of Nations having to intervene further, and they believe that the emotions expressed by Tokyo are purely a product of the current extraordinary period. It is expected that Japanese leaders may not deeply feel that their League of Nations membership can be abandoned without careful consideration.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 28th It cannot be officially confirmed whether the Japanese government has decided that if the League of Nations insists on implementing Article 15 of the League of Nations Charter on the Manchurian case, it will withdraw from the League of Nations. This statement was first published in various newspapers on Saturday and Sunday. Judging from the current situation, it is highly probable. It is rumored that League of Nations Secretary-General Sir Drummond informed Japanese representative Sato a few days ago that the League of Nations intends to implement Article 15 of the Charter on the Manchurian case. This statement has not yet been denied by the authorities, so it must be true, and Japan has repeatedly refused to apply this article to the Manchurian case, so if the League of Nations does implement it, Japan will probably withdraw from the League of Nations. According to Article 15, League of Nations members reserve the right to take actions deemed necessary to maintain justice and fairness.</p>

<p>Soviet Russia May Unite with the US to Contain Japan (National News Agency, Moscow, 27th) An editorial in the Red Flag newspaper, the organ of the Soviet Russian Army Committee, claimed that a war between Japan and the United States for control of the Pacific Ocean is inevitable. Although the "duel" between the two countries has so far been limited to diplomatic negotiations, newspaper battles, and military exercises, all of this is sufficient to indicate the inevitability of armed conflict between the two imperialists. The newspaper did not discuss what significant implications a US-Japan "duel" would have for Soviet Russia, only warning that if Japan provoked a conflict with Soviet Russia, it would weaken its ability to fight the United States. It has also been expressed in Russian political circles that in the future, Soviet Russia may unite with the United States to contain Japanese aggression in Asia, but the newspaper has not yet mentioned this.</p>

<p>The Chinese Nation Surprises the World with its Emergence  Hope for White Solidarity  Berlin Telegram, 28th: The Berlin Post reported this morning that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini commented on the Far East conflict, strongly urging the unity of the white race, with extremely straightforward language, saying that the future progress of the world, as a result of the Far East events, is hesitating at a crossroads. According to observations, there are roughly three paths: First, the Soviet Union will soon ally with China, emerging to compete for world power. At this time, China will be like a protectorate, but the political and economic importance of this move is currently impossible to predict, but it can be asserted that it will be a disaster for the world. Otherwise, Japan may be able to establish a racial hegemony in China based on the principle of "Asia for Asians."</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>However, whether Japan can operate successfully is still questionable. Sooner or later, there will be a danger of Chinese retaliation. At that time, China, relying on its abundant raw materials and low labor costs, will no longer depend on foreign markets, and will close its market to Western industrial products. Chinese culture is older than Greek and Roman culture, but its progress is often hindered by a lack of a spirit of struggle. However, this nation, which values ​​literacy over martial prowess and has neglected military preparedness, has recently shocked the world with its military bravery and personal courage. If it can surprise the world with its military achievements, then it should not be difficult to achieve surprising achievements in other areas as well. Finally, he also stated that no matter what the future of the Far East may hold, the white race must be united and there must be no more internal strife. In short, Europe, America, and Australia are now holding the key to the fate of mankind, and so on.</p>

<p>The government decides to severely crack down. Thirteen members of the Blood Pledge Corps are charged with murder. A professor at Tokyo Imperial University is suddenly accused of leftist thought. Tokyo Telegram, 28th: The Japanese government's crackdown on revolutionary thought has recently become more and more severe. All those who oppose capitalism and parliamentary politics are severely suppressed. At the same time, it ordered the Ministries of Interior and Justice to study specific measures and prepare to submit them to the extraordinary Diet in May. The methods are as follows: (1) Increase the power and personnel of the higher police; (2) Increase prosecutors and seriously investigate the thoughts of criminals; (3) Customs inspections will be particularly serious in handling ideological matters; (4) On the border, strictly crack down on the entry and exit of ideological figures and books; (5) Order the Ministry of Education to instruct all religious groups and educational institutions to promote respect for religion and the Japanese Emperor.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 28th: Thirteen members of the Blood Pledge Corps, who were involved in the assassination, were formally charged with murder this morning. Since Takuma Dan was killed on March 5, the prosecutor's office has been investigating the matter and learned the content of the assassination conspiracy. It is reported that those who were to be assassinated included Saionji, Tokugawa, Makino, Inukai, Wakatsuki, Shidehara, and the leaders of major companies such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Okura, and Yasuda.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 28th: The authorities mobilized a total of 1,000 police officers and detectives to investigate the Blood Pledge Corps, at a cost of more than 5,000 yuan. The prosecutor will conclude the preliminary hearing at the end of this year due to the seriousness of the case, and the public trial will be held in May next year.</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 28th: The Metropolitan Police Department learned that former Kyoto Imperial University Assistant Professor Katsujiro Yamada and his wife participated in the Leftist Cultural League and carried out extreme leftist secret activities. On the 24th of this month, the authorities issued an order to the Meguro Police Department to investigate and summon Yamada and others for questioning. According to Yamada, he has donated tens of thousands of yuan since last year as funds for the party's activities, and admitted that he is an official party member. From this, the authorities have launched a series of investigations, including Shinya Okawachi, the eldest son of Masatoshi Okawachi, the former member of the House of Peers and Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Cultural League, Jiro Nomura, a member of the Standing Committee of the Proletarian Science Central Committee, Ichiro Hitono (a graduate of Tokyo Imperial University), Hokichi Ono, a member of the Standing Committee of the Theater League Central Committee, Tsurujiro Kubokawa, Secretary-General of the Cultural League, Ryohei Hirata, a member of the Standing Committee of the Proletarian Science Central Committee, and Shigehiro Kawano, ten important figures, are being seriously questioned by the Nakano, Yodobashi, and Yotsuya police departments.</p>

<p>Parades and Demonstrations are orderly. Declaration to Continue the Struggle for Independence. Havas, Dublin, 27th: The Irish Republican Army paraded in Dublin and most cities and towns in the country, as well as important locations in Ulster, to commemorate the 1916 Easter Rising. There were about 5,000 members of the Republican Army in the Dublin parade, and tens of thousands of civilians followed behind in formation, all directed by officers in plain clothes. The procession went to Glasnevin Cemetery to pay tribute to the souls of the dead. Each team was led by a green, white, and yellow republican flag. There were many spectators along the way, but no one in military uniform was seen, because all soldiers were not allowed to take leave today. There were also no security forces in the city, only a few police officers maintained order. After the five battalions of troops marching in front of the cemetery rang the bell, they lined up in front of the flag, and the people listened quietly to the declaration of the Republican Army, which stated that the army did not want to be disbanded, and that the 1916 declaration was still regarded by the Irish Republican Party as a sign that the party had the right to fight for Irish independence. After the ceremony, the marching teams dispersed without any incidents. No one from the new government participated in the parade.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 28th: Yesterday's parade and demonstration by the Irish Republican Party passed peacefully, but serious anxiety still exists, because it is not known how long the current chaotic situation will last. The general feeling is that sooner or later conflict between the Free State Army and the Southern Irish Republican Army is unavoidable. It is well known that the Republican Party is still hiding military weapons in various parts of the country. Today, the Southern Irish Republican Army issued a warning to the de Valera government, stating that the Republican Army will remain an organized army until the Anglo-Irish Treaty is completely abolished. De Valera initially thought that the abolition of the oath and the solution of the land issue would win the support of the Republican Army and enable the Republican Army to disband on its own. The Republican Army's warning came as a surprise to de Valera.</p>

<p>A total of thirteen. Songjiang News: The Songjiang County Public Security Bureau received a confidential report from Shanghai at 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, stating that a large number of Japanese spies had infiltrated Songjiang and planned to cause trouble. The Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate. They soon learned that the Japanese spies were hiding in the Yue Temple outside the West Gate. They immediately sent police to surround the temple. However, there were many tourists in the temple, making it difficult to distinguish between the real and the false. Therefore, they defended the front and rear and searched the tourists in the temple by name. Twelve people were found on the spot with incriminating evidence and were taken back to the Public Security Bureau for questioning.

<p>Japanese goods will suffer a fatal blow. The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported that, according to a trade correspondent from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry in Chicago, the US government, in order to protect its domestic manufacturing industry, will impose an additional tax on foreign imported goods in addition to the existing import tax, and the tax rate on Japanese goods will be the highest. That is, 109% on Swedish goods, 111% on British goods, 112% on Danish goods, 114% on Norwegian goods, and 121% on Japanese goods. If this is implemented, Japanese goods will inevitably suffer a fatal blow.</p>

<p>Japanese goods pile up like mountains in the market. Students and workers rise up to inspect. The Kneeling and Crying Group is renamed the Persuasion Group. Tianjin Correspondence: After the wave of boycotts occurred in various places, the sales of Japanese goods in various commercial ports decreased, so a large number of them were transported to Tangshan for sale. The villagers competed to buy them because they were cheap. In the past few days, the large and small packages transported to Tangshan were all Japanese goods. The goods piled up like mountains, worth more than one million. The faculty and students of the academic and industrial circles were heartbroken and could not bear it. They formed a team to march to the city party headquarters to petition on the 18th of this month at the time of the Anti-Japanese Association of All Circles and implemented inspections of Japanese goods. Participants included representatives from Jiaotong University, Fengrun Middle School, and various labor unions, who questioned Party Secretary Yang Letian, demanding that Japanese goods be immediately blocked and not allowed to be sold. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce and treacherous merchants were preparing to refuse the inspection and were protected by the armed forces of the Chamber of Commerce. The situation was extremely serious. Later, Zhou, the president of the Bank of Communications, came out to mediate and agreed to register Japanese goods within three days. After that, Japanese goods would not be allowed to rely on them. It was delayed until the 23rd, but the registration was not actually carried out. The academic and industrial circles believed that there was no sincerity and were extremely angry. At around 9:00 AM on the 23rd, more than 200 students from Jiaotong University and Fengrun Middle School held wooden sticks and held a demonstration parade. All the shops in the city closed their doors one after another. The student team passed the gate of the Public Security Bureau, passed Guangdong Street, and sealed up the Ruizhisheng Commercial Firm. Then they inspected the Sanyisheng Grocery Store and the Kuifa Inn, and then went south to the front of the Liangyisheng, but the store had already closed its doors tightly. The students opened the door with wooden hammers and transported the Japanese goods stored out of the door. The military and police tried their best to dissuade them. Ning Wu, the director of the Public Security Bureau, also rushed to dissuade them. Later, the student team turned into Grain Market Street and broke the glass on the door of Liangyichang. Fortunately, the store was equipped with an iron gate, and the students could not rush in. They detoured to the back wall of the store, trying to climb over the wall, but because the wall of the store was too high, they could not jump over it. They then poured into Dingchang and Hongchangtai, destroying the goods. From 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, they had not dispersed. The merchants then held a meeting in the Grain Guild Hall on Xingli Street, deliberating for a long time. Thousands of merchants held wooden sticks and rushed to Grain Street to the street entrance, only forty or fifty feet away from the students. The situation was extremely tense. Fortunately, the military and police came out to stop them, not allowing the merchants to move forward. Yuan, the captain of the local garrison's transportation teaching team, also came forward [missing text]. Seeing the merchants coming to retaliate, the students dispersed a lot. The military and police then persuaded the remaining students to go to the city party headquarters and also persuaded the merchants to return to the guild hall. As a result, all the shops were not open for business. There was still no solution to the problem at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Another report: The Tianjin Businessmen and People's Salvation Group held a regular meeting on the afternoon of the 23rd. The committee members present were Liu Zhitian, Nian Guangyao, Zhang Yanzhi, Cui Yongan, Xu Zhuoran, etc. It was decided that the Kneeling and Crying Group should temporarily stop its departure and be reorganized into a Persuasion Group to replace its work. Three teams were organized, with a total of 130 people, wearing plain clothes, who set off on the 26th to politely persuade various merchants.</p>

<p>Seventy Communists Arrested</p>
<p>Currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The case of the Communist Party being uncovered in this city a few days ago, up to today (the 24th), there are still continued arrests, totaling more than 70 people. The vicinity of the organ department at No. 26 Xiaowangfu Gate is still under martial law. If there are any who come again, they will still be arrested. It is reported that there are about 100 communists in Jinan, and most of them have been captured this time. Yuan Chunrong is an important party member. The officials have been investigating and interrogating for days. Except for a small number of suspects, most have confessed. However, Yuan Chunrong is still cunning. Among the students from various schools who were arrested, there are many from other counties, and only a few from Jinan. Perhaps it is because those from other counties are slightly farther away from their families and have no supervision from their fathers and brothers, so they have strayed into the wrong path. It is also heard that the party members' subsidies are only twenty or thirty yuan per month, which is also very pitiful. Fan Mingshu (Bingchen), the former principal of Shandong Provincial No. 2 Normal School, who is 67 years old and has gray hair, was also arrested on suspicion and has not yet been released.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Longhai Railway Plan Extended to Xi'an <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>If it proceeds smoothly, it can be opened to traffic in fifteen months. Zhengzhou Correspondence: Since the Northeast Incident and the Shanghai Incident followed, the National Government, in order to resist for a long time, moved its capital to Luoyang, and the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang decided that Luoyang would be the capital and Xi'an would be the accompanying capital. The position of the Longhai Railway suddenly became important, and the road construction from Tongguan to Xi'an, which was still under construction, was therefore noticed by all parties. The amount of funds required for the construction plan and the duration of the construction are also what the people of the country want to know. The following is what was learned from the survey of the Engineering Bureau of the Road.</p>
<p>According to the previous resolutions of the Central Government, the Longhai Railway was built with the Boxer Indemnity from Russia and was to be completed within five years. Since May last year, the Ministry of Railways stipulated that before the Russian Boxer Indemnity was allocated, the Ministry would temporarily raise some funds on a monthly basis to start construction. The Engineering Bureau was subsequently ordered to be established, and the construction of the roadbed began from Tongguan to Huayin, a distance of 20 kilometers. The route was also measured from Huayin to [missing text]. The plan was just set, and suddenly the situation within [missing text] changed, and the construction funds were suspended. Later, relying on the assistance of Jinpu and Long [missing text], more than ten million yuan was borrowed successively, and the first section of the roadbed was completed. The land price has also been paid off, and other construction projects are still waiting for funds to proceed.</p>
<p>The Tongxi section is 131 kilometers long. Except for the Lishui [missing character] Erqiao project near Xi'an, which is more difficult, there are no major difficulties. In order to reduce leakage, the Engineering Bureau of the Road uses concrete arch bridges as much as possible for all bridges, but some steel bridges still need to be built. It is estimated that approximately 6 million yuan is required for bridges, steel rails, machinery, etc. purchased from foreign countries, and approximately 4.3 million yuan is required for locomotives and vehicles. The direct expenses for domestic engineering, such as land prices, earthwork, bridges, culverts, and paving rails, ballast, bridges, and houses, plus general affairs expenses, etc., amount to approximately 3.7 million yuan, totaling approximately 14 million yuan. If the foreign materials can be financed through the returned Boxer Indemnity from various countries, the monthly domestic cash requirement will not exceed 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition to raising sufficient funds, the most active planning before construction is the transportation of materials. The materials for the Tongxi section, such as steel rails, accessories, sleepers, wood, various components for large and small bridges, and cement purchased domestically, total approximately 46,000 tons, all of which must be transported from Pukou, Dapu, Qingdao, and Tangshan to the construction site. Each material train is calculated at 400 tons, which requires 120 material trains. Assuming that five dedicated material trains are organized, each train travels more than 1,000 kilometers to load and transport, if there is no hindrance from weather and personnel, once every ten days, that is, 15 trains can be loaded and transported each month, and it will take eight months to barely complete the transportation of vehicles on various roads. Vehicles are already lacking, and business must also be taken into account, so for the sake of convenience, a batch of locomotives and vehicles must be purchased first, specifically for the transportation of materials, otherwise the transportation of materials will not be effective, and the construction will be delayed.</p>
<p>At present, the eyes of the whole country have turned to the Northwest. The Tongxi section of the railway is eager to appear before the deadline. However, the difficulty of material transportation is as described above, and the construction is still subject to the control of the weather. For example, the work of bridge piers and the upper beams of steel bridges must be completed before the flood in the river, and the masonry work of culverts must be started before and after the ice is cold. These are all natural limitations. Therefore, the planning of the construction must make the economy, time, weather, and materials closely intertwined. Once there is a delay, the whole situation will be affected. If the local order is stable, the government will use sufficient strength to urge all parties to help with the spirit of sharing the same boat, then the road can be opened to traffic in 15 months.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Conscience Opening Market Buddha <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Originally, there are many ways to save the country. Soldiers save the country with guns and cannons, and save the country with their lives. Civil servants save the country with planning and politics. Businessmen save the country with business. Students save the country with studying, and the masses do their best to save the country.</p>
<p>Merchants stopping the market to save the country is the last resort. It is a policy of "eating arsenic to cure a tiger". It is by no means a fundamental way to save the country. Therefore, the market should be opened when the war stops, and the market should be opened even when the war does not stop, because stopping the market to save the country is a very boring strategy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the government has decided to resist for a long time. If the business community also stops the market for a long time, it will inevitably lead to the complete sacrifice and bankruptcy of Shanghai's commerce. Shanghai's commerce is not only the center of world commerce, but also the center of China's commerce. It is when the national crisis is not over that it destroys its own resistance strength. The clumsiness of the plan cannot be added. Therefore, to truly save the country, "the market must be opened, and to truly strengthen the strength to save the country, the market must also be opened.</p>
<p>However, to open the market, one must touch one's own conscience and look at the national disaster. If one has a conscience, one can open the market. If one has no conscience, one cannot open the market, and one is absolutely not allowed to open the market. If a shop without a conscience openly opens the market or secretly operates, the most severe means can be used to deal with it.</p>
<p>We should embrace the determination to endure hardship and the ambition to save the country. We should not be arrogant, impatient, hypocritical, or opportunistic. We should do it with conscience, put down our steps and implement it. We will not give up until we reach the Yellow River, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal. We will reap what we sow. No matter what, there will be fruitful results.</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that rather than saying that it is a painful opening of the market, it is better to say that it is a conscience opening of the market.</p>
