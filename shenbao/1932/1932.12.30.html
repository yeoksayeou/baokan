<p>歲　云暮。轉跟又是一年。回顧此年以來。國本飄搖。則創深痛鉅。東省之失士未復。滬戰之創傷未平而今熱邊之烽火又舉河山破碎。敵騎縱橫。外侮日急。直欲置我於死地。而内則庶政未修。戰亂迭作。歲稱豐收而民困倍增。野盈餓莩。道載流亡。甇甇子遣水深火熱求生不特得。歸死無所。嗚呼。此一年之中。吾人蓋無日不在血淚糢糊之中偷渡其殘。生耳之所聞。目之所見。更無一不爲哀痛慘絕之哀號。歷歷往事從今追億。吾人眞不知涕泗之何從。</p>
<p>乃者彈指即是新春。民間習俗。例皆互相餽遺宴會。小至一片伸賀。亦似不可缺少。揆之常情。吾人終歲勞碌。鮮有相聚作樂之暇時。趁此歲暮。斗酒自勞。即親戚良朋。終歲睽隔。亦趁此機緣。聊伸愛幕之悃忱。蓋亦未可厚非。然而今日何日。民族沉淪。千鈞一髮。即令臥薪嘗膽。猶店不能挽救厄運於萬一。燎原之火。已迫眉睫。詎復有吾人從容燕嬉作樂之地乎。尤有進者。目前關外義軍。方轉戰於氷天雪地之中。忍飢忍寒。以血肉與敵人相搏。凡上鐵血健兒。乃眞爲我全民族生命之所託。後方給養。吾人豈其能辭。而謂我人能有多餘之金錢。以作餽遺宴會之用乎。而謂吾人忍安然斟酒自奉乎。以故吾人主張。應將今日一切無謂之新年酬應。一槪省略。而以此有用之金錢。完全捐助東北義勇軍。以厚其陣容。以壯其氣勢。保民族一線命脈。留東省幾處乾凈之土。猶獲見我青天白日之國旗。飄揚於其間。勿使全淪於强敵鐵蹄蹂躪之下。是則吾人目前萬不容不急起實行者也。</p>
<p>日前馬相伯先生假無線電播音演講。請全國同胞一人一天捐助一銅元。援助東北義勇軍。其言絕痛。有曰。「義軍大都露宿野外。沒有衣服擋寒。大家裹些柴草。或是掮個馬鞍。沒有了糧食。只有把草根樹皮充飢。諸位。這又爲着誰呢。難道他們死光了。我們還能安然無恙嗎。難道東三省淪亡以後。關内仍舊可以安如泰山嗎。？」又曰。「東北那些民衆。吃了自己的飯。拚了自已的財產生命。爲國家爭取這數千里的領土。現在他們血肉擋着砲火。連衣食都不周全了。我們還是燕雀處堂怡然自樂。這對得住他們嗎。一國人國人。東北義勇軍果爲何人而戰。義軍今日所處之境况。其慘痛爲何如。吾人今日應否積極援助義軍。其深思之。其深思之。此非慈善事業。吾人之身家性命託焉。使人人皆謂義軍宜救。則請自今日省略無謂之應酬費用。移捐東北義軍始。</p>

<p>同人等承見示以淮河斷西圖甚多、又蒙皆以規定各處　築隄率高度及隄距之方法、因知固已妥籌一切、配賦必要亡斷商面積以防歷來之最大洪水量矣</p>
<p>雖然、欲適合此等情形、隄距應需極寛改買田地按目前經濟狀况自屬不資、故第一期内導淮委員會不得不勉動作理想十較次之計劃、而限其工作爲修理現有隄岸成建築近淮河之新隄、　距僅半公里至一公里、頂高亦較所　最後應筑者略低、</p>
<p>現在實施之淮隄　築規劃、自洪河口以下　約四○○公里各支流隄長、尙不在内由所列之　觀之可見九二一年或一九三一年（民或十年及民國二十年）之非常洪水量、約有百分之五十能容納於　隄之間</p>
<p>在此有限之洩水量範圍以内、同人等審察此一都份計劃完成後　以證明其完善與有效、以防止　來雖遇較小漲水、卽遭淹　之廣大可　　田不受洪水氾　之災矣、可見修築淮河大隄及辦理洪澤湖上資以洪洩水　　縱實洩之必　工程、均　刻不容緩之擊、俟上項工程全部舉辦後、往皆水旱頻仍之巨災、庶可免除、</p>
<p>至於淮河上海支流之處、所擬改正及數處擬含　、同人等建議在　　任何工程實施之先對於淮河河勢及由附屬受水區域來之逕流速率與水景、因而發生可能之影響、應加以周密考慮、</p>
<p>委員等復建議所擬頻臨洪澤湖上雙溝附近穿過高　、以縮短淮流之擊直工程不應　行須俟在洪水時精測所擬鑿直兩端之水面高低　設兩竭水面、實　高下、有如同人等所推斷將無充分利益以證實工程用網之得當、又此事或在舉辦必要之初步　　工作時發見爲岩石、或間以極難開挖之土質亦見其　礙難行、</p>
<p>討論淮河上游　畢、同人等茲提及現在蚌埠鐵路橋處之河　、終須予以擴大、</p>
<p>至於洪澤湖導淮委員會擬　湖修築圍隄、以增此種天然蓄水庫現有之容量、俾於短促洪水期内所有一部份、不能安然宣洩、免致爲害下游之進水量、得以停蓄於中其規劃係於每李大部洪水量洩淮後湖水位保持其在黃河零點上一三·六○公尺、據此什算、在上述水位與一二·五○公尺或上游乾旱時最低降至一一·○○公尺間所着量足依前浑灌漑之用、以迄次年春夏漲水之復見、　　何時湖水須於下次上游洪水將　之前　低至一二·五○公尺、必要時用蔣壩擬　之活動壩、以操摐之、</p>
<p>洪水期内、應調節湖水洩出之量使適合下游排洪水　之容量、其逾量之水、停蓄湖内、如前所　、非常洪水期内、最大洪水量、决定爲每秒一五○○○立方公尺、導淮委員會擬定此期内湖水洩出之量、爲每秒　○○○至六○○○立方公尺　視當時揚子江水位情形定之據此、則湖中水位、將逐漸增漲、前者最高可達一五·六五公尺、後者可達一六·一○公尺、洪澤湖圍隄項　築至洪水位上一·五○公尺、</p>
<p>同人等對計劃、表示人體　同、覺其所解决者、不　爲淮河防洪問題、并爲航運與灌漑問題也、湖隄内低於一三·六○公尺之田地自必湮　而不能耕梳但人皆知其人都係無主之地無論如何、洪澤下游航運與灌漑之利益、關係國家、總較更爲重大也、</p>
<p>現在淮河洪水、由洪澤湖洩出、漫無調節其主要出路經三河及高寳賢邵伯諸湖尙有由洪澤湖出張　河以入運河者而六閘與邵伯湖來水匯合、於是各流經由五道引河而人揚子江淮水盛張之年、因尾閭不暢不　盡量宣洩、於是决口漫隄運河東西兩岸、田嚋廣漠、　水淹沒、問有終年不退者、致受大災、如以揚子江於　所能便利承受之洪水量外、尙未獲證明其不復暫時容納　多之水量、故導淮委員會擬定操縱湖水洩出之量、俾滴合下游情形、仍保持三江營入江原有絡棧視爲主要排洪水道、而以直接入海爲輔也、</p>
<p>在　要　論導淮委員會計劃之先、同人等茲可述及經實地考察與愼置研究所擬間接或直接入海水道後、未見有何可用之經濟或完方法、俾得任取此等路線以　導治之主要目的、故除將來或可採用人海水道以排洩、小部份洪水爲一種增進安全之方法、同人等覺此計劃、無須更進研究也、</p>
<p>爲調　湖水宣洩計擬於蔣壩附近築一活動壩藉以操　湖水流經三河及高寳　湖、而　邵伯新築船閘之下如是、則洪澤湖與邵伯間淮河洪水、控制於一　立水道内、運河西隄、不復如　來之　險又可見西隄現有各港口、無須保貿而於修築時、應即永遠堵合同人等對計劃之人體、雖都裘示贊同但於高寳湖中建　雙隄、俾成河槽、其所得排洪洩量、同人等以爲並無特殊增益故建議在實施此計項需費極鉅之工程前、此部計劃、　作更准之研究也、</p>
<p>至於蔣壩擬築之活動壩爲排洩、每秒九○○○立方公尺最人水量、計必需設置洩水門、總寛共爲六○○公尺、至洩水門適宜式様及運用力法、須將待壩址完全考騐之結果而定、關於此點、以及上文所述對於其他擬建閘壩地址均可採用卽在進行計劃閘壩工程之先同人等覺實施充分血精　之鑽騐、以斷定下面地層件質之工作、實爲必要、　人等承告以　處已經鑽騐之法、但覺所得或果精度、沿堪討輪、就此種擬辦之重要工程而言同人等視爲必要者首先用四寸鑽土　打人地下而復　層油出中心管、以資考騐并記明深度、</p>
<p>洪澤湖之張　河洩水道内、導淮委員會爲欲調節洪水洩水計建船閘於淮陰附近、改直之運河　内、又改建直濟　爲洩水門、并閘數道引河計計劃之達到應需目的、　　可信但同人等建議、若　　而研究　擬築之船閳移西南約二里里、俾位置於僅需新河道較短之處則經費大爲　省也、</p>
<p>此外防洪問題、係關於山東運河束部需諸水泗河沂河及沭河、其現狀均深切有關於運河與其周圍之洪水情形、道淮委員會擬定上述諸河、應分别疏治俾各有　流入尾閭、以排除洪水、同時分配接濟中運河之水量以供航運灌漑之需同人等覺此後甚得當也</p>
<p>前列數節、　人等勉爲述及關於改善淮水現狀而起之重要問題、防洪自爲主　、已予以滿意之解决、而淮運灌漑增通之便利　易發生　故同人等建議下列各項工程應首先舉辦、不容或綴者也、㈠蔣壩之活動、㈡邵伯之船閘及運河西隄之需修築之處、㈢淮陰附近之船閳及改建息濟閘爲洩水門、㈣洪澤湖之園隄、</p>
<p>此外　待别注意於導張山東　河洪水分疏入　以減輕運河現狀之問題、而　擬劃劉洞船閘　早爲建築完成上項各工程并續述淮河上游應築之隄防後、防洪問題、庶可確定解决、而今日旱季狀况大爲改　、且六閘以下橫　各引河口、現在每年堵築之歸江各草　、自無從再築矣、在結論之先同人等對運河擬築航運船閘之設計方面、欲略貢意見竊謂加以　核或亦有益、卽導淮委員會初步設計、船閘入口寛度定爲十一公尺同人等經考察運河中現在通航之最大船舶尺寸航道之限制寛度及雖經增淮便利後之早季所得水深、此項寛　太大、可滅爲八公尺或九公尺、經費大爲節省而對此問題、同人等可引述整理海河委員會現在辦理永定河治嘿計劃中之北倉船閘工程、近已告成、同人等建議由運河擬建船閘之負責設計　建築人員前往　案詳細情形、當極有用也（完）</p>

<p>京滬滬杭甬鐵路局長黃伯樵、昨日下午二時、柬邀各報及通訊社記者、在該局會議室、報告一切、到各報社記者約二十餘人、當由黃局長及副局長吳紹曾、先後報告、未更請各記者、對路務之積弊及應興革之處、就平日所聞見者、貢獻意見、而由黃局長親爲解答、至晚五時始散、茲將黃吳兩局長之報告、分述於後、</p>
<h3 id="c123">兩路經濟現狀 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>黃局長報告云、本人自奉部令就任以來、正値兩路備受摧殘之餘、且在此局内風潮迭興之際、對於應付及整飭之工作甚爲繁冗、故諸位屢次過訪、均未能親自接見、實深抱歡、茲以局務諸重大問題、已有相當解决、故特邀請諸位來此詳細報告、諸位惠然肯來、殊覺榮幸、兩路之營業、在一二八淞滬抗日戰事以前、已甚困難、其原因爲京滬路與揚子江並行之故、一二八事變、兩路備受摧殘、路局焚燬、路產損壞、直接損失八百九十三萬餘元、間接損失五百六十七萬餘元、合計達一千四百六十餘萬元之鉅、事定以後、一方面復興整理、費用浩繁、一方面市場凋敝、金融奇緊、遂致營業不振、收入銳减、而兩路之困苦危急亦更甚、姑就兩路大部份負責而言、截至本年十一月底止、計欠中英銀公司本息八百餘萬元、購車欠欵四百餘萬元、廣九欠欵二十餘萬元、及滬杭甬到</p>

<p>跌價傾銷市面爲所紊亂</p>
<p>中央社云、日本漁輪鶚丸、上月曾進口兩次、以在我國領海侵漁所得、復售諸我國市塲、獲利以去、茲悉該日本漁輪復於二十五日進口、運入小黃魚·鯊魚·鰻魚·等一千一百箱、重三萬餘斤、該船爲避免我國人耳目起見、將船泊於楊樹浦、用駁船運進、託由十六舗永茂·愼豐兩蔬萊行代售、當時國產冰鮮桶頭小黃魚每担價格在十四元左右、而該日晒漁輪所運進之黃魚、每担祇開盤六元至八元、跌價傾銷、故魚市爲所紊亂、</p>
<p>期未付借欵一百八十餘萬元、共計欠欵一千四百萬元有奇、數目之大、已可驚人、而兩路經常開支、僅薪工月需六十三萬餘元、本年十一月份、收支相抵、尙短九十餘萬元、現已到十二月底、一切亟待開支、乃兩路現存欵項、僅四十二萬餘元、儘用之於薪工　項、尙短二十一萬餘元、至如兩路復興整理之計劃、凡修理橋樑、建築碼頭、添置機車客貨車、更換枕木鋼軌、遷移並擴張各機廠車站、及明年下關浦口間輪渡工程完成後、本局應增設備、一切用欵、尤難數計、如不急行籌度、不推進展無望、即欲維持現狀、亦且不能、</p>

<p>至於今後之努力、抽象言之、約有數端、㈠鐵路係國家交通機關、一切須以服務民衆爲主旨、故嗣後務須革除一切不合理之習慣、使之合乎商業化、㈡鐵路係屬專門事業、在在需用各種技術人員、不能稍有遷就、苟非實際所急需、更决不輕加委用、即遇業務增進、不得已血需添人時、亦必經嚴格考核、爲事擇人、漸不爲人擇事、㈢財政必公開、兩路値殘破之餘、惟一救濟方法、積極是增益收入、消極是節省支出、對於債務、則還本付息、勿使愆期、各種支欵、槪付公開、並按期將各部分財用狀况、製定簡明表式、公之於兩路全體同人、絕不含糊苟且、務期欵不虚糜、事歸實際、㈣積極建設、增進效能、除將本路殘破部分迅速整理外、其他各種新事業、關繫兩路發展前途者、務求按兩路經濟狀况、積極進行、使之合理化、商業化、無論在何種情勢之下、必努力前進、不達目的不止、其他如局方之設備、關於工作之效率至鉅、如現在有機車六十六輛、而其中三分之二無車廠儲藏、終日暴露、損失甚巨、而多數工人、亦均在　天工作、其效率亦減少不小、將來當視需要、添置設備、免受上述損失、</p>

<p>本人就任之始、鐵部并添設副局長一人、以爲輔助蓋本路自實行負責運輸以來、事務倍增、且在不斷研究改進中、吳副局長、精於鐵路成本會計及鐵路管理、能合作努力、自覺易於應付、况兩路决非以現狀爲滿足、正在亟求改革及增進、如㈠鐵路之延長、擬自南京西延以入安徽江西、東則延長鐵路迄於吳淞、則内地物產可直達海口、銷售世界、㈡津浦路與京滬路間長江上之輸渡、明年春夏之交即可完成、屆時兩路運輸可以直逹、上述兩種設施完成後、路務亦必增多倍蓰、故副局長之添設、對路務之改革及營業之振興禆益不少、</p>

<p>先生、我是一個女子、在十幾歲時就出嫁、當時夫家只有我倆夫婦連姑嫜共二人、外用一個僕人家中是世代讀書　雖是一個舊式家庭、却狠和睦我的丈夫是個老來子又是個獨子、如嫜對他自然愛惜不肯令他進學堂但在私塾中讀書、又可惜生得遲、已趕不上科舉時代圖個發展又因爲世代書香、也不肯令他到商界中謀事、娶親之後、就在本地敎中文、所幸　時不遞民國初年、生活不高人口又少、祖上原留下有一二百畝田再有一點敎館的東修、倒還可以勉强度日、但是過了這一二十年情形却大大的不同了、我現在已經生了男女儿九人、大的已經在高中及初中讀讀書、小的亦在小學讀書最小的正懐裏吃奶因此單獨穿衣吃飯住屋就較從前多用得兩三倍再加上一筆敎育費、如何　用、百物是逐漸的昂貴家中田產又常常遇着荒年、所敎的館因爲民智開通、稍大一點的學生都　學校、不肯在私熟讀書、朿修收入、因此又較從前减割、就這幾層關係、近十年來卽一年不敷一年、虧空逐漸增加到了去年、姑嫜又不幸去世待到各事辦畢已經負債纍纍而且追呼得不了、到此通盤打算無可奈何只有變產還債之一法、初意夢賣之後、還可剩得二三千元、稍做一點事業以資糊口那知近來因爲糧娬奇重　價低　、以及清丈等種種關係有錢的人都不肯買田、田價慘落、賣了還清債務之後、竟至一錢不剩如今是十無片瓦下無立錐又不能不吃不穿不住房不上學要吃要穿要住要上學、是一無進欵我的丈夫單　敎這百十元的館與我自已帮𦔳打打手工、是萬萬不毅支撑道份門户的因此我的丈夫積極想出去謀事但是旣無學常出身又無科學智識小學校里的敎師、現還有許多師範畢業生眼巴巴地望着、那得容我們插足、若　政界呢又無人力、若說商界呢、又是外行因此　　是無處託足、再說我自已呢、小學雖進遇、并未畢業、現在已不適用、手工是我所長、但是又沒氣力去做那些粗事、科學本未人門、中文也只能算認得幾個字會算兩句、這様人才、又到那裏去找飯碗呢、總之我倆夫婦對於勤勞憸機誠實這六個字、是訓練有素的再加上在還種瓌境之下只要上不辱祖宗門楣中不失自已人格下不損子女面目、其餘是什麽苦事、都可以做什麽遠路都可以去的、但是雖然抱着這堅决忍耐的志　願、依然還是找不着事先生、你看這是如何好呢、衣食住三層　固然是一日不能缺就是敎育費、也是萬不可省的、因爲我的子女皆是很勤儉而愛好的孩子、所上的中學乃是著名的省立揚州中學所上的小學也是有名的、平常皆是弟兄在一處努力讀書沒有一個不及格的、在學校　的操行成績都在好的一邊若說因爲捨不得敎育費而令他們輟學、就從此半途而廢不能成材　將來那有翻身日子、豈不令人萬分的痛心而且就省了敎育買衣食依舊無着也是無濟於事、綜計每年的消費省無可省衣食住敎育四項、必須要有千元左右、進欵却是分文無着、　事也無　處可謀、豈不令人束手待斃活活的困死、丨先生、你們是才多識廣我特地不怕丨你嫌煩、將我家庭的狀况詳細的寫了這一篇求丨你們的指敎領導我全家到那光明有幸福的道路上去、以渡過目前這種難關、那就眞是感激不盡了</p>
<p>覆：我們一口氣讀完來信，眞爲之感嘅萬端。事實非常明顯，在來信裏，可以看清楚中國農業經濟社會是在如何一步一步走向沒落之途，同時，更顯然地告訴我們。一般小資產階級是在如何急劇地崩潰，很快地變成赤祼裸一個貧窮者，而他還在　扎着，呌喊着，四顧茫茫，涉渺無世路。不是女士個人的惡運，確確實實是我們眼前社會一般的病象，這不是一封簡單的書札，而是中間階級崩潰沒落的寫眞。女士的經歷，旣然是一般的，　末女士要求我們解决這困難，根本辦法，也就非從「一般」入手不可。但是女士所要求的却是目前的具體辦法，關於這點，我們祇有請你同你丈夫暫時忍耐應付着，一年家用千元左右，似乎還可以省點，大兒子請畢中學，也不必　升學，就可以去找職業做了，實在說，在這社會讀了書也未見得就有用。另一方你丈地當然也應該想法找職業做，雖說現在人浮於事，找業困難，那也只有請你丈夫遇事屈就點把小資產階級的架子拉下來，些些小職業只要肯留心。遲早總可找到罷。自然，這還只是治標的辦法，根本救治，還是應該從根本着手，只有解决了「整個一。才能解决「局部」。這點應請女士認清，並希望你的子女們都認清。</p>

<p>（九）救國的唯一方法「敎役」我並不希望全國的大中學生立刻到綁下去實行但是我很希望他們在三個月内、在全國各大事及各中學中、聯合有　之　速速的　敎育救國會組織起來、　到組織完備以後、然後聯合各處的敎育救國會、組織全國敎育救國會、來請政府下一命令、人意如下、</p>
<p>「凡全國中大學生於畢業後、須遵照全國敎育救國會章程、在全國敎育救國協會指導之下、赴各鄉執敎育役一年、而未經敎役一年以上之大中學生　　　給文憑、㈡不得就職業、㈢不得論嫁娶、㈣不得受遺產」</p>
<p>學生畢業後、在此國難時期中、不肯施敎育於人、就是顯出此人不能盡職缺乏同情心、所以認爲一種未有公德的人、當在國人共棄之列、但是學生經過敎育役以後、每年應由政府開一盛人典禮、中國府主席及各省主席、親授敎育役證書、確定爲國民一種無上的榮譽、</p>
<p>學生旣然盡了他們施才的責任、資產階級當然也要盡些輸財的責任、然後再由政府發一命令、大意如下、</p>
<p>一凡中華民國國民、享有資產上之權利者、應於國稅項下、徴收敎育救國稅百分之幾、充全國敎育救國的經費　並由各省或各縣組織經濟保管會、負保管及分配之資、其章程由全國敎育救國協會議訂之、如有國民能自動捐𦔳敎育救國經費者、當由政府論功議奬、」</p>
<p>目下施敎育有人、經費有着、但是要使三萬萬人受敎育、普遍到四百萬方里的國土是中國歷史上一件破天荒的人事、所以要集全國的　等專門人才在國都及各省區市、組織全國敎育救國協會、來設計指導及運行這敎育救國的大事業再由政府發一命令、大意如下、</p>
<p>凡中華民國國民中之高等專門人才、應於一月内、齊集國都或各省區市的都會、組織全國敎育救國協會及各省區市分會、設計指導及促進全國鄉村敎育事宜并組織全國社會民生各富源　各種統計專局、并可自由使用中央廣播電台、播送全國、一切費用、由政府供給、但會員均爲名譽職、」</p>
<p>、試寫　文應注意其思想之條理與材料排列等六·應用文件　凡宣言·契據·章程·廣告·及其他公文書　等皆可令學生習作、</p>
<p>七·文學作品　凡小說時歌戲劇、皆可令學生試作、</p>

<p>— 侍</p>
<p>生命像一條流水似地，時常激起了浪花　　我的生命是短短的，但仍然有些事時當使我辛酸地回憶。</p>
<p>當我方能夠記憶的時候，坐大祖母膝上時常聽見她說：「你將來一定是一個好孩子，在你落生的那一夜裏，你的祖父夢見鄉間一棵最大的樹燒起了火·而你的母親夢見一個鄉村的敎師來到她的屋裏·再也不肯走開；他們的夢醒時，你便哇哇地啼在人間了。」</p>
<p>說來好像是奇怪的，在我二十二歲的那一年，我已經當了敎師了。</p>
<p>但隨着我的發生，不幸的事是不斷地繼續着。</p>
<p>我的一個嬸母累次對我講：</p>
<p>「你將來長大了的時候，應當好好地報答我，沒有我你不會活到現在了。你的母親最喜歡賭牌，往往賭到大明，而你的父親又是常常　夜也不回家的，夜深時你醒來便要哭閙丨你的脾氣從小也就不好，哭聲是那様地緊促，你的母親聽見你的哭聲，放下牌回到她自已的屋裏，開始抱着你哄你睡着，但是很少能夠騙得過去，一放下你，你便又大聲地啼哭着了，你的母親想着牌，可又放不下你，於是氣起來就把你　在地上，有幾次，當我跑到你母親的房裏去看時，你已經冰冷地　在地上，死過去好久了。一</p>
<p>但最不幸的是，我母親的暴躁的性格完全被我承襲了來。</p>
<p>自從入了小學校的那一天起，每一年總有兩三次要被學校開除·而且總是因爲和同學的吵架。同班的學生是非要受我　管束不可的，不肯服從我的，我將以武力克服他，下午三四點鐘放學後，便是我使用武力的時候：率領着我手下的一帮同學，伏在要路口上，候着那個反抗者，　捉到他，直打得他跪在地下求饒的時候·才肯放過他去。最後，同校　學生，不再放在眼裏了，把對象移到隣家的小學校去，那種對打的情况，我的筆是描寫不出來的，但每當我想起了那時候的事，我立刻就想起了一羅密歐與朱葉　」中兩族相殺的場景來了，最可惜的是，雙方都沒有武器　　　　　　這様的一個反叛性格的小學生，却入了一個最嚴厲的中學校。</p>
<p>開除仍是平常的事，但不是因爲和同學的吵打，都是和敎員有關的了。我還清楚地記憶着我們中學校的那位瘦臉孔，秃腦頂，圓鼻頭，鼠眼睛的訓育主任，他是不大講公理的，總是偏袒着敎員：每當我從敎室裏被招到訓育課，他大發雄威的時候，我便和他講理，他不講理，我也便不再講，任憑他怎様發落　他的處罰，一向是嚴重的，但我有同學作後盾，會以全班的名義向學校當局請求，因爲每一次的事件並不完全關於我個人的，常是受了許多同學們的鼓動。</p>
<p>時代已經不同了，那些不講理的敎員與主任，也許被新的開明的人們替代了吧。直到現在，我仍然覺着我在中學校時和敎員們的衝突，沒有　次是應當歸罪於我的。</p>
<p>在我從小學到中學以及離開了中學之間，我們　家是遭遇到幾次的風波。</p>
<p>我的父親是一個銀行界裏的人，專門作着買空賣空的事業，他最初很幸運，創出了一個小資產家的家庭，可是在我小學畢業的那，年，我父親的投機失敗了，於是我們的家遇到第一次的破產，</p>
<h3 id="c196">說食色與慾 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>食色性也，這是千眞萬確的事情。「朱門酒肉朽，野有餓死骨，」所以要有階級　　鬭爭。一邊是「後宮佳麗三千人，」「　日君王看不足，」一邊是「石壕村裏夫妻别，」「夫戍蕭關妾在吳，」所以要革命。然而食色兩慾，因爲是基本的慾望，滿足滿足是非常容易的。任你是一個怎様的大食家，只敎有斗酒隻雞，三碗白飯，一個大餅，總也可以打得倒了。吃飽之後，就是何曾請客，再也吃不下去的。至於色字，我想無論怎様的精力家，最多十個女人　就可以對付　罷，經歷過十個女人之後，就是西施太眞，再也挑不起性慾來了。所以原始的基本慾望，是容易發付的；最難對付的，却是超出乎必要之外，有長無已，終而至於非變成病能不可的那一個抽象的慾字。哲學家或名之曰慾念，中國的舊套文章裏所說的慾𡋹，就是這個東西。</p>
<p>照西洋哲學家說來，這　個慾字，是進化的主動力，因爲有慾，大家纔去做工，發明，貯蓄···然後纔有社會，進化，文明··。這原也不錯，從慾念的好的方面說來，當然是如此的。可是在中國，這好的方面的慾念，反不見發達，面在作長足的進步的，却偏是這慾念所催生的壞的一方面的事實。中國人因爲有慾，所以要去刮地皮，賣官爵，爭地盤·×××，弄到後來，變得目的意　也完全忘了，甚而至於倒認手段就是目的。儒林外史裏的一位吝嗇者，到死時不肯斷氣，只在　惜油燈裏的兩根燈草，决不是想像，却是中國社會裏常有的事情。正　其是如此，所以老子要勸人知足，佛家要苦說湼盤，叔本華要絕滅意慾，而羅素在說所有慾的務宜抑制，創造慾的必使增加，纔是消滅戰爭的根本大法。哲人之敎，誠然不錯，但中國可惜是進化得太早了。</p>
<p>當歐洲產業革命未起來之先，中國在數千年前，就飽滿了這些知足無爲的大訓，所以正應該激勵慾念的生長，催發物質的進步的時代，中國倒落得個逍遙自在。及到十九世紀以後，西洋物質文明的徇爛華富　流入了中國，中國人之久苦於無爲知足的乾枯寂寞者，就一躍而從這極端跳到了那極端。於是江河日下，洪水滔天，我們中國人就成了一個創造由他們（西洋人）去創造；享樂且由我們來享樂的民族。斯般格拉正在愁慮到西洋文化沒落的年頭，中國要人恰好是穿四十兩銀子一雙的絲襪，開五十兩銀子一瓶的香檳酒的日子。霹靂一聲，日本和其他各帝國主義的軍隊，堂堂開入了中國，窮苦老百姓，非但食色都無，連一條性命都保持不了了，憂國之士，纔議論紛紜，思想起何以彼之能强，我之能弱來。於是守舊者，就說物質文明害了中國，急進者就說先知先覺，先聖先賢，便是造成現代中國積弱的罪魁。兩方都說得有理，可是兩方似乎都還沒有說得全對。</p>
<p>總之第一是『時機』的問题：中國正因進化得太早，便成了落後得太遲，當應當提倡物質文明的時代，只提倡了些幽靈似的精神文明。第二是『取捨』的問題；西洋物質文明，同時候侵蝕到了東方，而日本却取了牠的好的一方面，中國只取了牠的壞的一方面，譬如是　個胡桃，日本人取了牠的肉，而中國人却只取了牠的殻。</p>
<p>物質文明有什麽罪呢？慾念又有什麽罪呢？</p>
<h3 id="c197">蕭伯納與女優的戀愛 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>近來有一本書簡集愛闌特　與蕭伯納（EllenTerryadbBerdardShaw出版），凡四百餘面，所錄的　是這兩個人的戀愛信。特麗是一個　業的女優，在通信時她已五十歲，然而仍不失其爲愛蘭特麗，還有許多人崇拜她。蕭伯納稱讚她的藝術這：一親愛的愛蘭，無疑的，你一定要神化了，纔可以演出戲劇來；一入神化之境，你就什麽都不懼怕了。』</p>
<p>蕭伯納自誇爲愛爾蘭的貴族後裔，他比愛蘭年輕八歲。</p>
<p>他們倆的戀愛彼此有些不同，愛蘭是一個沒有大志的婦人，她只是一個登峯造極的女優。她因爲天性近於女優，成名是偶然的，不是「以力致之」的。蕭伯納郤是一個有大志的人，他寫戲劇不僅僅是爲了戲劇，他所做的一切都是有目的的。他在戀愛信中還是不忘記　的盛業，所以愛人蕭伯納是與戲劇家蕭伯納糾纏在一起的。他在戀愛之中寫信給愛蘭本人都曾這様說：『我愛女人，但我也誠懇的喜歡别的東西。大半的女人把一個男人和一生當作整個的世界：我郤需要古今中外都與我發生關係，我要使著作機器加速度的進行，戀愛只是我的娱樂和休息而已。』</p>
<p>當這書简開始時，蕭伯納正在星期六評論寫劇評。特麗則爲蘭心劇院（LyceumTbeafre）的主角。</p>
<p>這本書简不是和尙與尼姑的書简·當然不會十分規矩‘但他們倆直至本書的最後纔有肉的氣息！眞摯而且强烈。愛蘭圍攻他’他每天要寫給她好幾次信，並且寫得很長。蕭伯納也圍攻愛蘭，愛蘭寫給他的信也一様的多，不過沒有他那様長。蕭伯納寫得又美麗，又浪漫，即使在火車上，顚動得很厲害，他也還是爲『美麗的鄉村和幽靈般的月光所迷，寫了許多濃情密意的話。有一晚他到多輕（Dorking）去，他寫信給愛蘭道：『我現在非常的牽繫你，我不安定，一個男子的不安定總是爲了一個女人，我的不安定就是爲了特麗。』</p>
<p>也不知是爲了報復呢，還是别有原因，蕭伯納竟於一八九八年娶了配妮　唐雪德（CharlotteFrancesPayneTcwnshed)爲妻，他寫信給愛蘭稱配　爲『淡綠眼睛和百萬家財的女人。』又說他與她戀愛只是換個新鮮罷了。』後來又說他『很歡喜她，愛她則未免太過了。』愛蘭在信中也駡配妮，這些信都已被愛蘭毁掉，所以這書简集中少了一部分。婚後蕭伯納對愛國蘭仍是一様親熱，愛蘭郤已大大的改變了態度。</p>
<p>直到一九二五年，他們倆還繼續通信，不過熱情之火早已熄滅，而光熖也早已暗澹了。</p>
<h3 id="c198">一個提議 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 洋</p>
<p>鄙人現在謹在全國人士面前作一提議，即：　　「將西湖邊岳武穆廟改做「秦檜廟」，把岳飛父子的像拉倒，另　秦檜夫婦銅像於其上，而以某也某也，及胡適先生等配享兩廡，秦檜夫婦有原的地位，（岳廟大門）　　岳飛父子鐵像以代之。」理由如次：</p>
<p>㈠宋朝是岳飛主戰，秦檜主和，現在即是岳飛主和，秦檜主戰，事實旣然顚倒，彰善罰惡之道，亦不得不改弦更張，春秋之褒眨庶幾乎榮於華袞而　於斧鉞也。</p>
<p>㈡胡適先生最近新發見，（據其告友人云云）據宋史所載，宋代所處環境，不得不降金，不得不講和。秦檜主和，實屬老成謀國，獨具隻服，其誅　岳飛，亦具不安内攘外的苦心。</p>
<p>用作歌以彰其事，歌曰：</p>
<p>岳飛本來是混蛋：</p>
<p>活該砍頭，抄家，禍延親眷；</p>
<p>秦檜本來是好漢：</p>
<p>當然殺人，放火，賣國，求和，安富尊榮如泰山！</p>
<p>「混蛋」「好漢」各自甘，</p>
<p>誰管得、後人的崇拜和埋怨！</p>
<p>現在的人心大變，</p>
<p>岳飛有了經騐</p>
<p>秦檜則不然，</p>
<p>前者竟主和，</p>
<p>後者却主戰，</p>
<p>遺臭流芳運亦轉，</p>
<p>各有千年！</p>
<h3 id="c199">蘇州印象記（四） <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 甫振</p>
<p>在派的引導之下，我就搭了從蘇州到本凟的小汽船·在充滿着田野風光的　波中前進了。經過了二時多，繼到了本凟。本凟是蘇州城附近的一個小鎭，人口也很緊密的我　們從本凟到天　去，約有六七里，翻道了靈岩山，就可以直達天平山了。從靈岩由到天平山，都築有很闊的御道，用磚側砌而成的　據沅告訴我，是乾隆皇帝下江南時築的，但是到了現在，還不是埋沒在蔓草中嗎？</p>
<p>當我們在蔓草埋沒下的御道前進的時候，祇有兩旁相山上的樹枝，在奏着自然的音樂來伴我們寂寞的伴侶；脚下踏着枯草沙沙的聲音，也很自然地和應着樹枝的歌唱，打破了片時的沉寂。丨丨不，也可以說史使心頭感到這山野的沉寂了，沉寂得　有沙沙的步聲和樹枝的風聲了，古人詩中所謂一蟬噪林逾靜，鳥鳴山更幽的景象，到現在方才體時到。</p>
<p>當我們在御道上進行的時候，還打兩旁的盧花，白得像雪一般的掩蓋了大地，　得像柳絮一般隨風東擺西颺，牠們輕盈描條的姿態，好似有宮仙子穿着雪白的羽衣，作霓裳的舞蹈。牠們在向我們點頭，在歡迎我們的來到，牠們隨風舞蹈着舞蹈着，不論在早上太陽披着彩衣升起的時候，或者在晚霞明減的時們，牠們始終是舞蹈着。他們孤芳自賞，不求人知，不喜歡人家的贊美，也不理人家的　笑；始終舞蹈着，牠們實在可以向人類露出騥倣的微笑。但是，不，牠們依舊很和善的歡迎我們　當嫦娥掛起了她的銀燈的時候，我想一定是牠們最得意的時候了。牠們眞　是爲藝術，牠們眞止是我們旅途中可敬愛的伴侶。</p>
<p>在驚奇的目光中，發現了很不經見的怪石，一塊塊竪立在山上。那就是沅告訴我的天平山了。在山脚下紅　佛寺的外邊，立着很多的　樹，牠們很高的　立着，堅忍地保持牠們舊日的精神。一部分的葉子，依舊像春天一般的　；但是春天的綠，不是牠們的時代，牠們的時代正在到來；一部得風氣之先的葉子都已漸漸地黃了，漸漸地紅了。</p>
<p>我們從佛寺走上山去，兩旁石上的　詠很多，怱怱地上山，也無暇細看了。寺裏一個和尚，慇懃招待，會客室裏也掛了許多書畫之類。在會客室旁，有一個缽孟泉，是用一隻大缸蓄水，水是泉水，係用一根竹竿接來的，水的來源很細，涓涓的流着，牠是怎様的清瑩透澈啊，牠非常純潔，好橡透明的水晶；當泉水落到缸裏時，好像晶瑩的珠玉一起融合似的。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>堂屋口的四扇玻璃屏門雖然緊閂住了，但堂屋裏的明亮的電燈光把　面的一切反射得很明瞭。有三個年輕的姑娘圍着一張八仙桌在化妝。坐在上面的恰恰和海泉的視綫相對照，最看得清楚。她滿臉塗上了白粉，在雙頰上也特别塗着紅紅的胭脂，俯着身，對著桌面上的一小鏡兒在修她的眉綫，一面畫眉，一面在說話。他只看見她的嘴唇不住地張動，聽不見她的聲音。海泉再望了望她們的身上，都是穿着一件絨質的白色襯衣，不單頸項，胸口也一部分雪白地露了出來。胸部的一對高峯也頗爲明顯。還有二個，一個是背着海泉的方面，一個是側坐着，比較看不清楚。</p>
<p>『平常人家的女兒那裏要這様搽指脂抺粉打扮得像戲台上的小旦一様。』</p>
<p>裏面的景象把海泉嚇呆了，他有些驚疑莫非是找錯了門牌號數。於是他仰起頭來向高頭一望，又明明白白是十五號。</p>
<p>『這明明是做不正當職業的女人的住家。大學生卓淑華决不至於住這類地方的。』</p>
<p>但是他又想着了從前有人批評大學的女生一部分是高等賣淫婦。難道那様活潑的卓女士就是這種女人麽？</p>
<p>他痴想了　忽，不敢呌門，但又不想走。幸得一陣冷風又把垃圾庫裏的臭氣送到他的鼻端來，他才覺醒了般的，朝着弄口走了兩三步。</p>
<p>『卓女士决不是這類〓女性。鄙人可以斷言！············』</p>
<p>他一頭走，一頭想，想到後來就像天文學家發見了特種彗星般的，一陣微笑泛到他的臉上來了，同時，緊揑着他的左拳，在作演講的姿勢。</p>
<p>『····何也？假如她是那様無聊的女子，她决不會那様坦直地呌我到這個地方來了·』</p>
<p>他想了一忽。更又向後轉，折回到十五號的門口來，下了决心，敲了一下門環。</p>
<p>『那一個？』</p>
<p>敲了門，立即聽見裏面有人在這様問。</p>
<p>海泉再把眼睛貼在門縫上，向裏面睞。剛才那三個女子中的一個，已經打開了門屏，立在堂屋口了。</p>
<p>『有一個姓卓的，是不是住在這兒？』</p>
<p>『對的。走後門吧。』</p>
<p>海泉正待轉身，忽然聽見有人在高頭呌他。</p>
<p>『密司脫林麽？對不住，請走後門。············』</p>
<p>這正是他所期待着的聲音。他忙抬頭一看，樓上的窗口打開了，卓淑華伸出一個半身，笑着向他招手。她的活潑的態度和在學堂裏沒有兩様呀。海泉看見她喜歡得話都不會說了。他只是，</p>

<h3 id="c226">論做官 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>關於做官，我以爲確是很重要的問題，自有一談之價値。</p>
<p>當我們父親還沒有在紅纓帽上加上一個銅頂的時候，他們便整日價眠思夢想：哦！由童生，而秀才，由秀才，而舉人，由舉人而進士，於是開始做官了，若想做清官，不妨清貧些，做個小京官，若圖撈幾個，就得設法拜老師，謀外放····最後。當然是火牌執事，擺滿門前，石獅子旁邊樹起高巍的旗竿，宗祠裏也掛滿自家的扁額，好不威風，何等堂皇，祖宗德厚的當然完全實現，而且還有修道成仙之福分，至於缺德的，唉····自不待言，就是說也傷心。</p>
<p>旣如此，這父親便是我們的父親，那末接受父親的遺敎，當然也是我們兒子的應盡之道，於是我們便得由小學，而中學，····而大學，而留洋了，但是似乎有點不對經，留洋以後是不是一定可以做官呢？這到有點難說，所以此路或許不通。所以，如照我們父親的老譜做去，到底不免傻瓜。</p>
<p>那末，我們應當怎様呢？當然自有道理，</p>
<p>不必說，諸位都是明白人，做官就未必一定要資格，而且更不必要不値一文錢的狗屁學問，要錢固不必說，最主要便是會吹牛，假如你硬說你是博士，誰會眞的來查你的文憑？</p>
<p>那末做官了以後，又應當怎様呢？更是値得研究。最初你就得學會穿中山裝和夾皮包，而且皮包要裝得飽滿，更主要的是讀熟總理遺囑和練習靜默三分鐘，當你還是小官的時候，你就得耐住火性，絕對服從，科長用官話駡你混蛋的時候，你要連忙應着；「是是是」，假如賞你一記耳光，更是看得起你，於是你就得摸一摸熱烘烘的臉，「不敢，不敢！」至於做大官，當然大不相同，走進辦公廳，不妨拍着桌子呌；「爲什麽還沒有弄好，國家拿錢養着你們，幹什麽事的丨」可是究竟什麽事沒有弄好呢？大可不必管它，只要屬員們俯首貼耳就可以。</p>
<p>至於做官會有什麽好處，那是鄕下摸牛屁股的粗人也會知道的，發財固不必說，就是討上二十個小老婆，法律上也不會承認你是重婚。大而言之，小官或許不容易私通外國，然而大官却公然賣國也無妨。假如你是武官的話，最忌的是胆敢和帝國主義交鋒，自家内戰，到不妨多來幾次。佔穩地盤，就是錢窖。勒種鴉片是絕妙法門。翻開歷史，儘可找着許多前例。與其流芳千古，不如遺臭萬年。</p>
<p>說來話長，只好中途打住，如有機會，且待下回分解，何况做官一道，我國讀書人素有研究，又何待小子曉舌呢？</p>
<h3 id="c227">摩登女子的徬徨 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>

<h3 id="c228">火柴的防潮法 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 希農</p>
<p>我們知道，木材預防潮濕的方法是將它不面塗以一層油漆，同様，火柴的防潮亦可應用此相似的方法，行將少量松香輾碎置於酒精中，加熱使之溶解，然後將火柴頭浸入該溶液中，的經數分鐘取出晾乾，如此則雖不意將火柴落於水中，亦仍可燃着，</p>
<p>機輪皮帶的塗油</p>
<p>機輪上旋動的皮帶塗上一種油可以增加相當的轉動効力，並且皮帶亦比較可以耐久。此種油的製法是將二分鉛黃與四分或五分蔴油和於二分水中煑成凝膠，用時和以相當的松節油即可。</p>
<p>去舊油漆漬法</p>
<p>去棉織品上舊油漆漬的一個简單方法是：一份松節油與二份阿莫尼亞溶液相和，用力震盪之使成乳劑色，而後用棉絮或筆等塗於舊漆漬上，經數分鐘，待油漆漬輭化，再用棉花擦去之。</p>
<p>一種自製的膠水</p>
<p>我們有時往往有這様一種須要，將紙與皮相黏，倘這用普通的漿糊或膠水來黏，常不易黏着，或雖黏着而生許多縐紋，致易脫下，故最好自己來做一種足應此須要的膠水，即以二百份樹膠一份檞皮酸各溶於水中，而後與五十份甘油，十份葡萄糖相和便可，此地有一椿事要注意的是；溶檞皮酸時水愈少愈好，</p>
<p>玻璃上寫字法</p>
<p>在玻璃上刻寫什麽東西，普通最简單的方法是用鋼筆醮矽酸來寫就行，但由這所刻出來的筆劃很粗，要想刻寫很細的東西，就得應用以下這個方法！</p>
<p>兩隻玻璃瓶，一置关竔水與十八克砩化　及克硫化　相溶另　隻亦置半竔水，内溶七克二綠化鋅，待完全溶解，再加三十克濃鹽酸，</p>
<p>用時，將兩瓶中的等量溶液相和，用鋼筆寫到玻璃上去即可，要在寫時即看得清楚可加幾滴墨汁進去，便能織微畢現。</p>
<h3 id="c229">「救國」是怎様的一回事姐姐： <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>想不到五年來不知行蹤的你，會在這様的塲合相見　你接着這封信的時候·也不見得以爲奇突嗎？因爲當時在這惱人的爵士樂聲中，我不慣久坐，蒙你告訴了地址，就在這裏寫些昨夜你急於要知道的我的别後情形，</p>
<p>五年前，在故鄉我是無可否認被目爲放浪的孩子，你是書香後裔，名門千金將我的莫須有的罪惡，認爲了事實以後，就不再和我見面了，於是我被驅逐出了故鄕，五年來我絞自己的頭汁，勞動自己的身體，以汗血換來每天的三餐茶飯，回顧在我的許多同鄉之中，如其說我是放浪的孩子，眞是自己都找不出一個理由，因爲嘗的苦味太多了，所以也認識了不少各式各様的人羣，新世界舉行這猗哉盛哉的救國遊藝大會的前幾天，我被朋友强售了幾紙門票，當然，自從九一八以後，東北義勇軍浴血抗日到今天，每個不能到前敵去的國民，都應該盡相當方法，盡國民之責任，所以我的錢囊無論如何窘澀的那天，也慨然購買下來了，昨夜上，沒有問過小糊塗，是否黃道吉日，在工作了一禮拜之間，約了幾個朋友上新世界了，昂着頭，隨着人潮擁進的當兒，我就知道並不像平時化兩毛錢進來玩玩的新世界·踏進跳舞塲天然也不是偶然的事，可是我這放浪的孩子，還是破例兒第一遭，誰料會遇見五年不知行蹤的姐姐，受了「放浪的孩子」的罪名，我覺得也得不償失了，</p>
<p>姐姐，你是名門的千金，如何涉在舞女叢中，竟分不出你的身價來呢，白的臉，紅的唇，堆上黑的亂髮，配上狹小旗袍中顫動着的肉體，一切的一切，如其你不見氣的話，恐怕也蒙上「放浪的女孩子」的嫌了，不過在這亂哄哄的年頭兒，假使亡國就在目前的事，可以放在其次（恕我說出冷血動物的話）我還得每天　扎三餐苦茶淡飯，與你說這些不相干的話，眞要被人家自爲「放浪的孩子」了，</p>
<p>不過昨夜和你的李先生，談上幾句寒暄，知道你對於這次的救國遊藝大會，是竭力帮助的，我仿老年人的口吻，嘮叨一句，「請你從根本做起罷」我呢，五年來，沒有發財，不能與你的李先生一様，穿上「跳舞救國」的西裝，不過還很安份守己，仍不失五年前「放浪的孩</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>子」本色，「救國」這様的大事，人微言輕，不敢化了兩三塊錢，就在人前誇口，姐姐如不如吝賜敎，請你告訴我，「救國」是怎様的一回事，</p>
<p>最後的聲明，昨夜踏進跳舞場，並沒有『跳舞救國』的本意，</p>
<h3 id="c230">失業後 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 王英</p>
<p>從上月起，我開始失業了，天啊!我不是布爾喬亞的資產階級，生活的恐慌和痛苦：是無庸說的了，最令我難堪的，是傍人的冷嘲熱諷，本來也無怪他們要侮辱我，因爲我已是所謂的無業遊民了！</p>
<p>芳！妻！她很識大體，雖然跟着我受苦，却毫無怨言，不像所謂摩登女子的愛情，完全以金錢爲轉移的，不過我這不中用的丈夫，自己覺得慚愧吧了，　　還有那白髮滿頭的老父，還不能温飽，唉！我這不肖的兒子！</p>
<p>昨天我　了雄兒，在街上漫步着，其實我胸中思潮起伏，那有踱方步的閒情逸致呢！</p>
<p>夫眞的雄兒；突然用驚奇的目光，向我詢問說：</p>
<p>「爹爹！昨天明兒！他底小友！譏辱我是窮鬼，我想到也不錯，爲什麽人家吃的是肥魚大肉，住的是高樓大厦，爲什麽我們却如此的痛苦呢？」</p>
<p>我脆弱的心弦，受了猛烈的剌激，二行熱淚，因了情感的衝動，不由自主的奪眶而出，</p>
<p>「爹爹！方才還好好的談笑，爲什麽現在哭了呢？我可不答應你的啊！爹爹！是我說錯了嗎？爹爹别再哭了」雄兒很惶恐的舉起小手，揩去我晶瑩的熱淚，</p>
<p>「不！孩子！」我撫魔着她的短髮，輕輕地對他說，「你不是想要吃肥魚大肉嗎？兒啊！怪我們的命運不好，我們是被幸福忘却了的人啊！」他似乎理會我的意思似的，慢慢的點着頭，</p>
<p>在歸途中，我想自失業至今，比較値錢的衣服，都質到長生庫中去了，秋風已起寒衣無着，不！明天的飯錢還沒有着落呢，積欠的房租咧，債咧，都將逼攏來了，「唉！這眞如何是好呢」，弱者的我，吐出聲聲的悲鳴，</p>
<p>唉！上帝，你待人是多麽的酷辣啊，幸福之神啊，是早已忘却了我吧！············窮：人祇能······！</p>

<p>讀書娱樂運動打成一片編者先生：</p>
<p>我讀了貴欄的三個組織以後，很有點感想！因爲這「星期學術討讑會」「業餘平劇研究社」及「業餘國術團」，我覺得部是很狹義的；我以爲與其是東一個組織，西一個組織，倒不如擴大一些，來一個整個的組織；比較有系統，比較有效力些。所以我的意思是將整個的店員和學徒都結合起來，組織一個「商界青年生活互助社」將以上的一切小組織，都歸納一處，豈非於我們店員和學徒的自身利益，更要大些麽？但是這様的組織，决不是少數人可以能成功的；我很想供給我們店員和學徒，大家來研究研究。</p>
<p>我有這個念頭，遠在數年以前，因爲環境的關係，總沒有堅决的去做，却也是個人的能力有限，現在况且我又脫離了商界。雖然我以前也是由學徒而店員而店主，但是已成過去了。</p>
<p>我現在盼望我們號員和學徒，要謀自身的生活發展，及體育，德育，智育，羣育，以及其他一切問題的解决，均應自動的組織起來。</p>
<p>這是我這一點小小的意見，供獻於店員學徒的面前，大家研究研究。</p>
<p>李二魔上言十二·二三·晚</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>讀了貴欄的「三種團體的組織」以後，我却有一點意見貢獻。</p>
<p>㈠是張先生利用星期餘暇來互相交換智識；㈡是馬陳兩先生利用業餘光陰來用作正當的娱樂；㈢是周先生提倡中國固有的國術來鍜鍊各人的體格。我覺得三種皆對，而有聯絡之必要。</p>
<p>因爲智識這様東西，是任何人都需要而無止境；同時要使辦事的能率增加則非有堅强的體格不可；要免去生活的枯燥而乏味則有賴於正當的娱樂來調劑。旣然這三種都是人生所需要的，那麽，何不擴大組織而互相聯絡。諸位先生以爲怎様？</p>
<p>盟吟十二·二十四●</p>
<p>×　　×　　×　　×</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>在下默察社會上大多數人的心理·發覺他們或她們總有點不同：因了心理上的不同，所以封於一事一物的觀念與興趣，也就互異了。</p>
<p>譬如注重文學的人，他們大多數是不喜運動的，以致身體孱弱不堪，動不動就要生病。倘使一旦不治起來，豈非大爲可惜：或者　長國術的人，力足以舉鼎，假使是「目不識丁」「之無難解」的，無疑的也要爲社會所輕視：至於娱樂，祇須是正當的，亦爲人生過程中應有享受。</p>
<p>因此鄙見要使學識和體格同時發達，再拿正當的娱樂來調劑生活；那末非把讀書，娱樂，運動打成一片不可。並且可以聯絡大家的感情，調劑不同的心理：藉此又可以鞏固我們青年的共同戰綫，集中我們青年的奮鬥力量。質之馬周二君及商明的讀者們，對乎不對？</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>他順手掏起桌上放下的那管旱烟依兩手捧了轉動着看了幾遍，低了頭可就想着，要用一句什麽話，來自圓其說呢？王二嫂在一邊早留意了，以爲他是要吸旱烟呢，將手伸到衣袋裏去，摸索了一陣，摸出六七根紅頭火柴來，都放在桌上，笑道；你抽烟罷。孟國寳笑道；鄕下人眞是省儉，幾根洋火，都會這様像寳貝似的。大概城裏人點一晚上的電燈，足夠鄉下人一輩子的洋火錢了。王二嫂拿了火柴過來之後，他就不曾退到門框邊去，站在桌子的那邊，手扶了矮桌子的一隻角，向他笑道：昨天孟先生說城裏的事，說得那様好玩。我聽了還想聽呢。孟國寳笑道：我在鄉下，還要住幾天，晚上乘凉的時候，我就陪着你們談談。王老二放下茶碗伸了一個懶腰，打着呵欠道：我還要去看看田溝裏的水着。孟國寳站起來笑道：是了，我有點糊塗，怎好正中午的和你們來談天，躭攔你的工夫呢。說着站起身來，就向門外走。王二嫂由後面跟着走了兩步，笑道：坐一會不要緊的，他到坂上去，我又不去。孟國寳已經走了，也不能再回去，又只好一直回家了。他行步順了，草塘的塘埂走着，塘埂上栽着梓樹的楊圓柏枝之類。那樹陰罩到塘裏·可以看到一尺長的大青魚，在水裏游泳着，於是站在樹下，向水裏出神，心裏不在魚，却在王二嫂，覺得鄉下少婦，又怕人，又不怕人，又不大方，又大方，别有一種風趣。王二嫂皮膚那様好，骨肉那様停匀，眞不像是個鄉下婦人，而且不像是王老二這種丈夫的婦人。我一見她，爲什麽有了一個好印象，我眞不懂。哦！是了。她不有些像女一中的皇后商賽蘭女士嗎？對了，她那漆黑的眼珠，長睫毛都像。正如此想着，只聽到拍拍拍，一陣很響的聲音，由水面上傳送了過來。抬頭看時，塘對過，一方洗衣石上，跪着一個女人，手裏拿了一個洗衣棒槌，在衣服上打着。那正是王二嫂，不過她先穿的是老藍布褂子，現在却穿的是白大布褂子了。當孟國寳由這邊看去的時候，她却停了衣服不槌，高聲向這邊道：孟先生你還沒有走哇。孟國寳道：這塘裏好大魚，我越看越愛。他說着話，怕路隔遠了，有些聽不清楚，於是走了回來，站在一棵埀楊樹下，手扶了樹幹道：老二呢？二嫂道：他上坂去了。她說着話，捲了兩隻袖子，由肘拐子以下的手臂，都露了出來，那様肥厚結實，現出一種健康美來。他兩手按着衣服，在水裏或石上，不停的搓挪着。</p>

<h3 id="c234">好萊塢的預言家說琪恩哈羅的將來（上） <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>琪恩哈羅　百從在上海放映的一金　　神及　　　愛」等片中　連績與我們相見之後，我們的腦海中，巴有這位金髮女郎極笑滿的印像。琪恩哈羅的丈失，名導演保羅　恩的自殺，亦曾轟動世界，本刋以前亦已記載過。所以　到琪恩哈羅的將來，係許多人所要知道的，大槪亦無須先祥細地介紹琪恩的過去罷。</p>
<p>我們所要知道關於琪恩的幾個問題，不在乎琪恩自從她丈夫死後，現在做些什麽？她的未來生活如何？她能否永久在影台上存在？以及她是否將再婚，再婚能否給她快活的恢復？　　這許多問題，許多愛護琪恩哈羅的人們，已經不住的問過。但是關於個人將來的事，誰能回答？就是琪恩自已，亦不能以人定　天一四個字來解答一切，現在好萊塢有三位預言家，將這幾種問題一一加以解答了，我們何妨以姑妄言之，姑妄聽之一的態度　先在本報上發表一下　倘使過了　年以後，好萊塢的預言家，所說的一一都已證實了，豈不是這幾位外　諸葛亮的先知之明，勝過我們的瞎子算命先生麽？</p>
<p>他們這三位預言家，一個是善於觀測星象的；一個是從茶葉　判决未來的；一位是從水晶球裏透視的，他們已合力將這未來之幕扯開，洩露了天機的神　，你們或不信他們的神話，但琪恩哈羅自己，已經深深地皈依了。</p>
<p>閔尼佛林MinnieFlyun女士，從前曾在百老匯著名一時，現在爲好萊塢最負盛譽的預言家。她在保羅尙未與琪恩結婚一個月之前，曾經從茶葉上的發現，告訴過他人，說不久好萊塢將有一影界大人物遭遇　死，並且說他的　死，將發現於與一金髮的女星結婚後二個月之内。他死之後，四週勝爲神秘的空氣所籠罩，而他的死，大槪不外乎自殺之一途。以上所預言的，現在都已一一將賣了，因爲保羅與琪恩結婚了兩個月，保羅己自已將鉛彈擊人自己的腦中而死了。閔尼佛林還有許多已往的奇蹟。她在凡倫鐵諾未死之前，曾經告訴過波拉尼格里，說凡倫鐵諾，不久將死在東方，那時凡倫鐵諾尙未得病，後來果然凡倫鐵諾在紐約得病而死了，歌舞大老闆齊格飛未死之前，她已經知道了。美國在大西洋觸礁而沉沒的鉅艦蒂但尼亞，尙未啟椗之前，她警告過某某等幾位大人物，因而改乘他船，未罹於難。以下就是這位閔尼對於琪恩哈羅的預言：</p>
<p>「我替琪恩看見了許多事情。我看見她將於兩年之内再嫁，那人係從東方來的，他不係電影界的人，但與電影事業些少有點關係。我相信她再婚後是快樂的，但其間還有許多許多事故發生。</p>
<p>「琪恩不至於就此離開影界。她現在所演的「紅塵」RedDust一定比從前的地獄天使Hel、sAngels及　髮女子RedHeadedWoman還要受人歡迎。她還要　續擔任「性」的角色在明年三月與五月之間，將有一十二分　人聽聞的案件發生，其中　涉的，有一位東方的商業家，及一位影界的女著作家，這件案子，鬧得一定很大，但於琪恩，不至有什麽損害。</p>
<p>「保羅博恩的死，現在雖覺得極爲神秘，但不久必定突然水落石出，琪恩係不至受何種不利的牽涉的」。（未完）</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c235">評「胡鬧市長」 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>胡鬧市長TheMayorsnest,根本是一部完全維繫在「胡鬧」上的滑稽片子。</p>
<p>雪泥霍特SydneyHoward,飾一個窮途遼倒的號手，因爲失了業，所以整天的在街上去找幸運：很巧的，遇見一位老夫人，她很賞識他。替他運動着，加入了市議會，因爲他是備　貧苦滋味的人，所以提倡爲平民謀幸福。於是大得人心，竟被擁戴，舉他作市長，他却仍不改初衷，與民同樂。</p>
<p>這麽一個劇本的基礎，就打在「巧合」，「和命運」上，在理性說，世界上，根本沒有這種僥倖的事，特别是痴呆如雪泥所演的人。如果再嚴格的說，這片子是不成體統了。不過在過份的描寫中，我們可以看着牠，還帶着些須的生命，例如牠很明白的說，「愚人之一得」呌不得志的人，不必灰心。同時牠也很坦白的描寫，英美的政治，市長不一定是能幹的不過應當一定是全市人所歡迎的，才可以立得住。</p>
<p>全部滑稽，無味取鬧的片子，導演就沒什麽可評的了。其他技藝方面，也平平，不過都還可以算有思想。在前後對照的幾幕，很可看。</p>
<p>雪泥，眞是老派的滑稽家了。他不用什麽來𡊷助，只是單獨的態度，動作，言語，來博觀衆的一笑，他表演方面，仍循着已過去的路。我不以爲那是落伍：我認爲，那可以呌人換換口味，這一次成績，和「到城裏去」，「海上風光」，差不多，丨當然不是退步，不過也沒有顯著的進境，配的兩位丨克魯特赫爾勃脫ClaudoHulbert,和墨爾愛克MutielAked,都很好，呌人一看見，就忍不住的笑出來。所有的演員，算在一起，都有幽默的詼諧能力。唱的歌，奏的樂，也是很好的興奮劑。</p>
<p>還有一點可以說，就是牠和「總統夢，很有相似的地方。</p>
<p>笑料很多，如果你正在不快樂，那末眞可以到南京去，笑一個小時，在英國片子中，這片子是不易多得呢！</p>
<p>末尾：我得請敎南京大戲院的當局，這片子，旣然不長，那末副片，當然也比較的重要了一點。但是昨天昨映的三部，内中兩部「百代」出品，分明是前兩個星期作過的。（我不記得是不是新光映過的，也許是南京自已映過的）。希望頭等院，對於這種短片，也略加注意。</p>

<p>— 澄</p>
<p>「前在國泰開映的「二十年前之秘史」中主角愛德華羅賓蓀EdwardRobinson是羅馬尼亞人，從小即在美洲生長。他有一個迷信，他說他無論拍什麽影片，他的妻子DorisLloyd總須加入，至少佔上幾幕，角色的輕重是不論的，否則沒有好的成績的，所以在SmartMoney一片裏，她飾一個女招待，TjgerShark裏，她飾結婚一幕裏的賀客。</p>
<p>還有雪茄烟是他唯一的嗜好，好萊塢的人，從來沒有看見他的嘴裏或手裏缺過一枝雪茄烟的，在家裏的时候，他總是抽着斗烟，他的屋子裏，有各式各様大小不同的烟斗。</p>

<p>— 史洪鈞</p>
<p>好來塢是產生電影人才之鄉，我們要注意，每顆明星成熟，並不是偶然的，她的過程中，一定有她勇敢的魄力，忍耐的精神，和　的環境奮鬭的歷史，這裏所說的幾顆，都是給我們很好的例子。</p>
<p>許多人說，熱女郎克萊拉賣扮演每個角色時，她的背景，常常在描摹她過去和生活决鬭的剛毅的精神：的確，她有很剛毅的精神：她生在勃洛克林，她的母親是有病的，克來拉幼時，她的母親便死了，她的父親是個侍者。她天性很聰明，當她未滿十歲時，已經了解人生世態，她知道自己是個可憐的孤兒。十幾歲時，她已長得姿容艶絕，這個，給她入電影界的機會，當她初入影界。她隱瞞着她的家况，所以沒有人嘲笑他的貧苦。</p>
<p>晚近負盛名的葛萊泰嘉寳，雖然她祇有二十六歲，但是她的過去，經過了許多的奴僕生涯；她做過理髮店的下手，做過婦女飾品店的模特兒，做過毫無價値的女伶，然後她流落到好萊塢，她初到好萊塢時，穿着鋸邊裙，短衣，線襪，完全不了解影界生活的狀况，給好萊塢一羣　榆傲人的奢華人物看着，愕然失笑，（未完）</p>

<p>— 康冰</p>
<p>却利卓别麟爲了阻止他兩個孩置身銀幕問題，以致和他的前妻麗妲葛雷涉訟事件，現已宣告終結，却利得到了勝訴。他現已預備着二萬元準備金來維持他的兩個孩子。</p>
<p>然而郤利對於他的兩個孩子究竟怎様地安置着他們的將來呢？人人都是好奇的探詢着。他是在希望培養他們成爲機械師嗎？律師嗎？醫生，或者政治家嗎？以至於做廚師嗎？不過因爲却利的素性不願公開他自已的私事，所以這問題終究擱置着。</p>
<p>雖然他是這様地珍秘他的私事，這裏郤蒐集了一些，關於他對兩個孩子的意見。他以爲他應該有相當的敎育，比甚麽多爲重要。他自信他們該得到一個機會自由地發展，至他們能自己决定他們的職業爲止。不過却利對於一切的事務都很草率，所以話雖是如此說，而將來對於這二個孩子的計劃會有變動亦未可知。也許會像范朋克在當初阻止小范朋克一様不許獻身銀幕，而現在小范朋克郤成爲了明星。</p>
<p>他現在正想寫一部近來旅行的游記。他預算須五萬字。他說關於這游祀，最後的一部份比開首更爲難寫。不過最近已殺青了五千餘字的末章。</p>
<p>郤利對於有聲問題的意見，現在似乎略已變更。他現在依舊無聲片佔有了靜的藝術，他對於「城市之光」的結果很爲滿意。他現在尙沒有决定他的新片，仍爲啞片，抑是有聲。然而倘使有聲的話，我們即可以見到他作風的改變丨或者他僅導演而不扮演。</p>

<p>桃羅絲德爾里奥DoloresDelRi這名翻着西班牙話，就是「河上的悲哀者」TbeSadOneoftbeRiven一九○五年八月三日生於墨西哥。她是墨西哥社會中的一朶交際名花。當她未入電影界時。她的原名呌做桃維絲愛生蘇樂DoloresAsunsolo,一位又富又尊貴的墨西哥小姐。她是在巴黎受過敎育的。她的聰慧也同她的美容差不多。皮膚和密糖一般，光滑而帶淺黃色。還有一種石雕美人的玉潔冰清。她這天然的美點就足使好萊塢的粥粥羣雌，黯無光彩了。烏雲般的秀髮。一雙幽鬰藏情的媚眼任誰見了也要銷魂的。</p>
<p>當桃羅絲在十六歲的那年，她離開了學校。同時她就與傑姆勒納先生結婚。</p>

<p>她最初試於陶樂賽麥開主演之“Joanna“一片中因以得名。導演家喀魯很讚美她這無雙的容貎。和表演的藝術。竟不肯放她走了。她祇得一而再，再而三從主演「戰地鵑聲」而「復活」而「卡門」以至於「鐵蹄紅舞」以及「雷夢娜」等。其有聲超人作品爲「壞坯子」。女士身長五尺五寸。體重一百十磅，玉色黑髮，美麗棕色之眼。她對於運動最喜歡在海灘上浴着陽光。她對於文學有特殊的嗜好，她睱時總手握書卷閱讀不倦。她並能通五國的語言爲好萊塢女明星中之第一人。</p>

<p>學者對鏡先做驚懼的表情。然後髣髦發現了剛纔驚懼的對象，原來是沒有的，完全是由你自己視覺的錯誤，但是又不敢否定那對象的存在，於是乎眼眶漸漸縮小，口腔，也漸漸緊閉，由喉間發出「吓？不對丨」</p>

<p>Japan Shall Bear Responsibility in Case of Any Accidents</p>
<p>(Nanjing) As the Japanese army's designs on Rehe become increasingly urgent and conflict is inevitable, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has cabled the recent actions of the Japanese army on the Rehe border to the Chinese delegation in Geneva to report to the League of Nations. Japan shall bear the responsibility in case of any accidents. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Japanese Conspiracy to Invade Rehe</p>
<p>Huge Sums to Buy Over Traitors and Supply Mongolian Bandits with Military Supplies</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army's conspiracy to invade Rehe involves using huge sums to buy over traitors. One village chief is appointed for every hundred households, and one guard team is formed for every four villages. Sanbaoyingzi has already been occupied by the Japanese army, with the traitor Liang Yunguo serving as the guard team leader, and Ma Chengxiu and Zhao Laozao serving as advisors, and Ma Zhaoyi and Li Duanxiang as clerks. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chiang Kai-shek is paying close attention to Rehe and has sent a telegram to the authorities in Beiping, stating that matters concerning North China and Rehe should be handled as appropriate. Chiang has also sent a similar telegram to Tang Yulin in Rehe. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese have recently been propagating their aggressive military actions against Rehe, claiming that Japanese planes have been bombing areas around Lingnan and Mangniuyingzi for days. According to a key figure in the Northeast, the areas around Chaoyang, Lingnan, and Mangniuyingzi on the Rehe border are all high mountains and steep ranges, with defenses so strong that one person can hold the pass against ten thousand. The Japanese claims are actually a feint to the east while attacking in the west, intending to use this as a pretext to clear out the Liaoji garrison. The Rehe border is not a major concern for the moment. We have made adequate preparations, and war will not break out immediately. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since this spring, the Japanese Kwantung Army Command has frequently sought opportunities to invade Rehe. Because Rehe is high-lying, making troop movement difficult, an attack on Rehe would inevitably result in many Japanese casualties. To avoid sacrifices and save military expenses, they continue to send liaisons deep into Mongolia and Rehe, carrying large sums to buy off Mongolian bandits in various places, providing them with military expenses and supplies, and directing them to invade and disrupt security in various parts of Rehe. Now, as the Japanese invasion of Rehe heats up, they have organized the Mongolian bandits they have bought into a pseudo-Mongolian independence army, which is infiltrating Rehe Province by various routes as the vanguard for the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe. (China United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tang Yulin telegraphed Nanjing, stating that the violent Japanese have recently increased their troop presence on the Rehe border in large numbers, and are buying off unemployed people in the Chaoyang Temple area, creating traitors to serve as the vanguard for the invasion of Rehe. Japanese aircraft also frequently come to Rehe to scout, and the situation is extremely urgent. If the enemy attacks, we are determined to resist to the death, etc. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Liaodong volunteer armies led by Deng Tiemei, Li Zirong, Liu Jingwen, and Wang Xiangxuan, nicknamed Huang Tianba, and others, fought the Japanese and puppet troops in Xiuyan for more than ten days. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and was finally defeated. Xiuyan is now garrisoned by the armies of Liu Jingwen and Li Zirong. In this battle, the army obtained many enemy woolen blankets, which our troops are using to make clothes. The puppet garrison commander Jiang Quan fled, and the puppet troops were all incorporated. Huang Tianba was seriously injured. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Juwu, the commander-in-chief of the Liaodong volunteer army, and Huang Yuzhou, the commander-in-chief of the 18th Route Army, have disguised themselves and arrived at the Rehe border. The headquarters of the 3rd Army Corps has moved to Antuyuan, and the 13th Route Army under Deng Tiemei has retreated to the Zhuanghe area. The 16th Route Army under Sun Xiuyan has detoured to Suidong. After his troops gather on the Rehe border, Tang Juwu will return to Huanren to collect his troops and continue the counterattack. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhu Qinglan arrived in Tianjin from Beiping by train on the morning of the 30th. At noon, he hosted the press, reporting on the progress and current situation of the volunteer army's resistance against Japan outside the pass. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Sanjianghao troops, entrenched along the Jihai Railway line, were greatly angered by the Japanese purchase of our patriotic heroes. They convened their troops to discuss a feigned surrender to lure the enemy. The enemy sent Saeki Koza, a Japanese resident in Jilin who colluded with bandits, to negotiate everything with the troops. When the troops arrived at Yantongzi Station to negotiate, the Sanjianghao troops suddenly raised a secret signal. The troops then simultaneously opened fire on the enemy, killing more than 30 enemy soldiers and several Japanese officials at Jihai Station. The remaining enemy fled in disarray. The Yantongshan area of the Jihai Railway was destroyed, and the people there were strictly instructed to swear to never cooperate with the enemy and resist to the end. The Sanjianghao troops then safely led their team away. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>(Qinhuangdao) The troops under He Minhun, Wang Yunping, and Li Ciru captured Zhangwu on the morning of the 28th, and divided their forces to attack the Japanese army in Faku. There were fierce clashes between the two sides. The troops under Wang and Li fought bravely, and won victories in continuous battles. (China United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>

The army left in Jilin is in urgent need of replenishment. There are currently more than 14,000 Japanese artillery and cavalry troops advancing westward along the Taonan line.

<p>(Nanjing) The Beijing liaison office of the 3rd Route Cavalry of the Northeast People's National Salvation Army received a telegram on the 29th from Qin Fengshan, commander of the route, dated the 25th, stating that 160 members of the army's dare-to-die squad, disguised as civilians, completely destroyed twelve boxes of ammunition being transported by the Japanese to the puppet road police on the pseudo-Fengshan Road on the 25th.

<p>Black Chairman Temporarily Replaced by the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs; Su Bingwen Not Going to Moscow</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ma Zhanshan was still in the Hinggan Mountains on the 2nd of this month. On the 3rd, Su Bingwen had already retreated, and the road for Ma to return east was blocked, so he went west with Su. The Black Chairman is now temporarily replaced by Lang Guanpu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. It is also possible that this is the reason for Ma's entry into Russia. It is reported that Ma is now living with Su's soldiers in Vomosk. Xu Guogui plans to return to China in the future, possibly via Europe. A report was recently received from the Shuhe area stating that a thousand Heilongjiang cavalrymen passed through a certain place to Beiping, and that Ma was among them. Investigations have shown this to be untrue. When Ma entered Russia, he was not listed in Su's telegram because of his different position and title. It was not convenient to include him.

Su is in Vomosk and will not return to Moscow this year unless there is something important. He has decided to share the hardships with the soldiers in Vomosk. Stalin telegraphed inviting Su to Moscow to celebrate the New Year together, but Su replied with thanks, stating that since our country has not yet eliminated the Japanese invaders, how can I indulge in enjoyment? The weather in Russia is extremely cold, below minus forty degrees, and the soldiers are suffering greatly. Each person only receives half a pound of black bread per meal, and merchants and their families are crying even more. Su gives a speech to the soldiers once a day, and recently said that the motherland will never allow you who have worked for the country to be stranded in a foreign land. The soldiers all hope to return to the motherland as soon as possible to continue resisting Japan. (Special dispatch, December 29)</p>

Yang will arrive in Hanzhong on the 30th. Xu Xiangqian's bandit troops originally planned to flee west into Gansu, but because Duan Zhongwu's 50th Brigade was blocking them on the Gansu border, they changed their plans and decided to flee to northern Sichuan. Most of the bandit troops were surrounded in Tianbian Temple, and about a thousand people fled to Tongjiang, Sichuan. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yang Hucheng telegraphed Nanjing at Shenshi on the 28th, stating that Wang Zhiyuan's brigade occupied Zhongjiagou Jingjunba on the 25th, and recaptured Longchichang Tianbian Temple on the afternoon of the 26th.

Most of Hu's division is still in Hanzhong, Liu's division is in Xixiang, and Xiao's division is in Shiquan. The telegram also stated that Hanzhong has cheap grain, abundant tobacco, and closed-minded people. The Central Army has never been here before, so there is a lot of isolation. Now that Hu's division has arrived, they are extremely supportive. If Hu's division had arrived a day later, it would have fallen into the hands of the bandits.

<p>Destroying the Bandit Nest at Baisha Ridge</p>
<p>(Shantou) The Red Bandits in western Fujian occupied Baisha Ridge, a high ground in Shanghang County, and established a pseudo-military region general headquarters. The model battalion, special service battalion, and guerrilla battalion of the 8th Independent Division of the Soviet Government of western Fujian, totaling more than 2,000 troops, were surrounded by the National Army in three routes: 1) Shen Guanghan and Liu Suoxiong, 2) Yang Sunian's 49th Division, and 3) Huang Renhuan's division of Guangdong in two regiments.

<p>The County Seat Turns from Danger to Safety</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Because they could not withstand the blockade, the bandits adopted a guerrilla style of independent activity. The special service regiment, independent regiment, guerrilla team of Wantai, and the Shacun Guard Company of the pseudo-Xingguo, with more than 2,000 guns and machine guns and mortars, launched a full-scale attack on Wan'an City on the 28th.

The county magistrate telegraphed Xiong yesterday, stating that the county seat had turned from danger to safety and requesting a reward. Dong's regiment Chen Cheng, fearing that the bandits of Lin Biao and Luo Binghui in Xiangdong would revive, came to the province yesterday on a tour and discussed plans for suppression with the provincial and county departments. Various key figures from Jiangxi province in the Central Committee, believing that the bandit forces in the province are still strong, sent telegrams to Chiang Kai-shek asking him to come to Jiangxi to command as soon as possible.

<p>(Nanjing) According to financial circles, the proposal to abolish taels and change to yuan is difficult to implement at present. Business circles are resisting due to old habits. The end of the business period is still during the old lunar year. If it is implemented immediately, social chaos will immediately appear. Moreover, the prerequisite for changing taels to yuan is coinage, but coinage has not yet begun, so it is particularly difficult to implement for a while. According to leaders in the banking industry, the financial situation in Nanjing has not returned to normal, and the breakdown of credit is the main cause. Whether or not the abolishment of taels and the change to yuan is implemented is irrelevant. If credit cannot be maintained for a day, then everyone will be wary, and the prosperity of the market will be impossible to restore. We believe that when various industries end this year, there will be no good signs in any industry, especially in the money industry, where bankruptcies and closures will break all previous records. At this time of decline in all industries, there will be many obstacles to implementing the abolishment of taels and the change to yuan, even if it is desired. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>The year is coming to an end. Another year is passing by. Looking back on this year, the foundation of the country has been shaken, and the wounds are deep and painful. The lost territories of the East have not yet been recovered, the wounds of the Shanghai battle have not yet healed, and now the flames of war are rising again in the Jehol region. The rivers and mountains are broken, and enemy cavalry are running rampant. Foreign aggression is becoming more and more urgent, and they want to put us to death. Internally, however, government affairs are not being addressed, and wars continue to erupt. The year is said to be a bumper harvest, but the people are increasingly impoverished. The fields are full of starving people, and the roads are filled with refugees. Children wander around, seeking a way to survive in deep waters and scorching fires, but they cannot find it. They have nowhere to die. Alas, during this year, we have been barely surviving in a blur of blood and tears every day. What we hear and see is nothing but the cries of sorrow and despair. As we recall the past, we truly do not know where our tears and sobs should begin.</p>
<p>The New Year is just around the corner. According to folk customs, people usually give gifts and hold banquets for each other. Even a small greeting seems indispensable. Considering the usual situation, we are busy all year round and rarely have time to gather and have fun. Taking advantage of this end of the year, we can enjoy a drink for ourselves. Even relatives and friends who have been separated all year round can take this opportunity to express their heartfelt affection. This is not necessarily reprehensible. However, what day is this today? The nation is in danger of collapse, and the situation is critical. Even if we sleep on firewood and taste gall, we still cannot save ourselves from our misfortune. The fire has already reached our eyebrows. How can we still have the leisure to indulge in pleasure and enjoyment? Moreover, the volunteer armies outside the pass are currently fighting in the snowy and icy wilderness, enduring hunger and cold, and fighting the enemy with their flesh and blood. These iron-blooded heroes are truly the hope for the survival of our entire nation. How can we shirk our responsibility to provide supplies from the rear? How can we say that we have extra money to spend on gifts and banquets? How can we bear to pour wine and enjoy it ourselves? Therefore, we advocate that all the meaningless New Year's entertainment should be omitted, and the money saved should be donated entirely to the Northeastern Volunteer Army to strengthen their ranks and boost their morale, preserve a glimmer of hope for the nation, and leave a few clean pieces of land in the East where we can still see our national flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun fluttering, and prevent it from being completely trampled under the iron hooves of the powerful enemy. This is what we must urgently implement at this moment.</p>
<p>The other day, Mr. Ma Xiangbo gave a radio broadcast, asking all Chinese compatriots to donate one copper coin per person per day to help the Northeastern Volunteer Army. His words were extremely painful. He said, "The volunteer armies mostly sleep in the open, without clothes to keep them warm. They wrap themselves in firewood or carry a saddle. They have no food and can only fill their stomachs with grass roots and tree bark. Everyone, who are they doing this for? Can we still be safe and sound if they all die? Can the areas within the passes still be as stable as Mount Tai after the three northeastern provinces have fallen?" He also said, "The people of the Northeast have used their own food and risked their own property and lives to fight for these thousands of miles of territory for the country. Now they are using their flesh and blood to block the artillery fire, and they don't even have enough food and clothing. Are we still enjoying ourselves in comfort like sparrows in a hall? How can we face them? Fellow countrymen, who are the Northeastern Volunteer Army fighting for? What is the situation of the volunteer armies today? How tragic is it? Should we actively support the volunteer armies today? Think deeply about it. Think deeply about it. This is not a charitable cause. Our lives and property depend on it. If everyone thinks that the volunteer armies should be saved, then please start by omitting unnecessary entertainment expenses from today and donating them to the Northeastern Volunteer Army.</p>

<p>Russian Ambassador to Japan inquires with Uchida about his opinions, saying that resuming diplomatic relations with China is purely an individual issue.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th, Electric News Agency: The Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan, Toraianovsky, visited Foreign Minister Uchida at the Foreign Ministry at 2:00 PM yesterday and held talks for about an hour before leaving. At this time, the Russian Ambassador suggested to Foreign Minister Uchida that he heard that the Japanese government believed that as a result of the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, there was no hope of concluding a Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty. In fact, Russia considers the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia and the Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty as completely separate issues. I will be returning home soon for health reasons. However, the Soviet Russian government is preparing to re-propose the Japanese-Russian non-aggression treaty to your government and hopes that this point will be given favorable consideration.</p>

It is reported that when the Japanese Foreign Ministry discussed this issue with the Soviet Russian Ambassador in Tokyo the other day, it only stated that Japan was unable to negotiate such a treaty at present, and the word "present" is generally considered in diplomatic circles to mean that Japan is willing to negotiate this matter in the future.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 29th, Electric News Agency: Former Parliamentary Vice-Minister of Commerce and Industry, Seiyukai Member Nakajima Kuhei, invested 290,000 yuan from a national perspective to establish the National Economic Research Institute in the Municipal Hall of Hibiya Park, with engineer Araki Toichiro as the director, to study controlled economic planning, general financial economics, and other related matters. For this reason, it is planned to recruit authorities in this field from Europe and the United States.

<p>The Leader is a Veteran in the Legal Field, Mr. Wee</p>
<p>New York Correspondence, In order to connect with American sentiments regarding the Manchurian issue, envoys from Japan who have traveled to the United States to lobby and propagandize have been incessant. There is now a plan to send a nobleman to the United States next January, and at the same time, they have launched an initiative to invite several famous Americans to visit Japan to exchange friendships. This move is actively underway. The leader of the tourism group to Japan has been tentatively set as Mr. George Wickersham, the former Attorney General of the Taft Cabinet and a veteran in the American legal field. He currently has a law firm at 40 Wall Street and specializes in legal affairs. A certain correspondent from the Dongbao News Agency went to visit him and asked if he had decided to go to Japan. Mr. Wee replied, "I hope I can go, but I haven't been able to decide yet. I plan to gather representative Americans from the business and academic circles to join me, but because of the economic downturn, I haven't been able to prepare quickly. As for the members, James Penley has already decided to participate, that is, Kang Mantou Aipan Huo (Translator's note: Kangzhou Du Aipanlei was one of the first people to sail into Japanese ports 50 years ago, and he is the great-grandson of one of them). Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, Mr. Wee did not want to say much and only said, "I do not think that the relationship between the United States and Japan should be affected by the China issue. From the point of view of investment and trade, I believe that both the Japanese and Americans have abundant opportunities, because China has a population of more than 400 million people. As for the change in American policy toward Japan under the Roosevelt government, I am afraid that President Roosevelt himself does not yet know, but the change of government may be followed by various changes, so it seems possible that the foreign policy of the American government will change.

<h3 id="e72">Japan's Never-Ending Diplomatic Tactics <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The First Step is to Publicize the Invasion of the Northeast and to Prevent Communism</p>
<p>The Second Step is to Threaten the Powers by Withdrawing from the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Third Step is to Entice Investors and Deceive Various Countries</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th, China United News Agency: After the September 18th Incident occurred, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' general policy for external propaganda was to prevent communism, saying that the Soviet Russian communist forces had reached the three northeastern provinces, and that Soviet areas had also been established in mainland China. For the sake of self-defense, Japan, for the sake of protecting the interests of various countries in China, had no choice but to preemptively launch military operations in the three northeastern provinces. However, this kind of propaganda from Japan has proven ineffective as the National Government hires bandits [unclear]. Moreover, as communist members are spread throughout Japan, more than 7,000 people have been arrested and are in prison, and tens of millions of people are continuing to operate within the country, so the world's various countries are not deceived by Japan's intimidating propaganda. Because using anti-communism as a military [unclear] has failed, it has been changed to threatening withdrawal from the League of Nations [unclear]. Japan's withdrawal [unclear] from the League of Nations will cause losses to Japan itself, and various countries will suffer no losses. This paper tiger is also disregarded. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has invented new tricks, causing its puppet Manchukuo to spread an atmosphere, saying that [unclear] the pseudo-organization has well-intentioned countries, and the pseudo-country will repay its debts, otherwise it will not repay them, thereby threatening investors from various countries and using investors to restrain their governments. As the League of Nations' general trend has been not to recognize the pseudo-organization as an independent country, Japan is once again using its puppets to spread an atmosphere, saying that all those who do not recognize the pseudo-country will be regarded as enemy countries, closing their doors to enemy countries and abandoning the principle of equal opportunity. Originally, Japan intended to annex the three northeastern provinces, but because the Nine-Power Treaty [unclear] stipulated the opening of doors and equal opportunities, it was still elaborating on the text in order to ease the world's criticism of its ambitions. Now it has suddenly become whimsical and wants to use the League of Nations to deny its own pseudo-country as a name to announce the abandonment of equal opportunities and the closing of doors, in order to achieve its goals. At this point, the ambition is completely exposed.</p>

<p>Gold Standard Effectively Abandoned - Former Prime Minister's Speech Expresses Dissatisfaction with the Government</p>
<p>Reuters, Cape Town, 28th: After several hours of political darkness in South Africa, clarity has been restored. In fact, it is now universally acknowledged that South Africa has abandoned the gold standard. However, the government has decided to keep the South African currency separate from the British currency. Trading is minimal today, but banks are still using the gold exchange rate from last Saturday and Sunday. There is a general feeling that the exchange rate is gradually approaching the price of the British currency. The Minister of Finance, Havenga, told a Reuters reporter today that we have effectively left the gold standard. Banks must now issue exchange rates on a new basis. Banks agreed to sell foreign exchange today, but only small amounts of British currency can be sold. Gold mining stock prices are gradually rising, and the market situation is more active than at any time since Britain abandoned the gold standard. Today, people throughout South Africa listened to the broadcast speeches of former Prime Minister General Smuts and former cabinet member Roos. Roos spoke in Johannesburg, expressing his desire to organize a coalition party to oppose the current government. General Smuts spoke in Germiston, praising Roos' success in reorganizing the Nationalist Party and stating that the combined forces are sufficient to overthrow the government. According to Roos' statements, General Smuts, while supporting the merger of political parties, still advocates maintaining the strength of the South African Party.</p>

<p>British Advocates of Free Trade Are Quite Disappointed</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 29th: It is reported that cattle breeders here support the proposal for Canada to exchange cattle for oil with Russia, as Russia's offer is higher than that of Britain. Political circles say that the import of Russian oil hinders the interests of the United States and South America, but not the interests of the British Empire. As for the suggestion that Russian coal be included in the list of Russian exchange goods, it has been dismissed.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th: British advocates of free trade are quite disappointed to hear about the proposal for Canada to exchange oil for cattle with Russia. They say that it has not been long since Canadian Prime Minister Bennett requested Britain to abolish the Ottawa Agreement at the Ottawa Economic Conference, yet the Canadian government is negotiating with Russia for the exchange of oil and cattle, and is now making unlimited proposals. According to reports, the Canadian Minister of Agriculture recently confirmed the cattle-for-oil deal, but Bennett denied it after returning from his European tour.</p>

<p>Paraguayan Army Retreats After Abandoning Three Forts</p>
<p>More Than 10,000 Casualties on Each Side Since the Start of the War</p>
<p>Havas, Bolivian Capital, 29th: The Bolivian General Staff announced that yesterday morning, Bolivian troops attacked enemy troops in the Guden area. The enemy troops there had strong defenses, but the Bolivian troops finally defeated the Paraguayan troops. The soldiers and equipment of the Paraguayan troops suffered heavy losses. The front line is currently very calm.</p>
<p>Reuters, Argentine Capital, 28th: After six weeks of fierce fighting, Paraguayan troops are reported to have abandoned the forts of Saavedra, Cormacle, and Mugua and retreated. Bolivia achieved a major victory in the Corcoma area of the Chaco Forest. The rainy season has now begun in the forest, so the undeclared war between the two sides may be indefinitely delayed. It is expected that Paraguay will soon withdraw its frontline troops, and it is hoped that the two countries can finally resolve the issue peacefully and avoid further war. It is reported that since the beginning of the war, the Bolivian army has suffered 18,000 casualties, and Paraguay has suffered 15,000 casualties.</p>

<p>Japanese Anesthetize the People of Taiwan Through the Power of Drama</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Taipei, 29th: Japanese warlords are using every means to anesthetize the people of Taiwan and gradually isolate Taiwan from China. In addition to using the puppet Xie Jieshi as a representative figure of Taiwan each time to make the four million people of Taiwan become loyal Japanese citizens, they are staging a drama tonight on the Taipei Broadcasting Station that insults our anti-Japanese patriotic organizations. The drama is called "Shanghai, the Magic City." The plot consistently portrays the anti-Japanese organizations in Shanghai as a group of complete scoundrels and hooligans. It focuses on the tragic experiences of a Japanese woman named Akiko and a ronin named Okamoto. It tells the story of Okamoto, who, under secret orders, carries a bomb and plans to destroy and bomb the Japanese consulate. However, he encounters his old lover Akiko and is influenced by her Yamato spirit. Later, he is moved by the national anthem "Kimigayo" and rekindles his aggressive nationalistic instincts. He destroys the bomb at the headquarters of the Anti-Japanese Association and dies with his lover Akiko for the sake of patriotism. Such an absurd and outrageous script is constantly being staged throughout Taiwan, and free admission is offered to fundamentally intoxicate Taiwan's relationship with the motherland and eliminate Taiwan's anti-Japanese movement.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Japanese Army Plans to Attack Jehol <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Peiping states that the situation in Jehol is extremely tense. According to sources from a certain military organization, since the traitors Cheng Guorui and Ban Jichun formed a puppet army, the Fengshan Road and Mianchao Road have been extremely busy with transportation in the past few days. Military vehicles are connected, and troops are continuously being added to the Suizhong border to prepare to the west to peep Jianping, first eliminate Zheng Guilin's department Yangyong army. Recently, the Japanese have also been continuously recruiting ignorant people Meng bandits at Yaowang Temple in Lingnan to form an invading Jehol army. At Chaoyang Temple and Wanxian, there have been no major changes in the Japanese army, and they are being transferred back and forth at any time. The Japanese aircraft reconnaissance is often seen in detail. The most vicious thing is to purchase grain wheat on the edge of Jehol. Recently, they are still widely purchasing with Japanese gold notes, causing great panic for the future food and financial situation in Jehol. It can prove that the Japanese ambitions are ambitious, conspiracy continues. The Nanling area on the edge of Jehol is still guarded by Dong Brigade. Chaoyang is a certain brigade of the Self-Defense Army. The area from Wanxian to Beipiao is the cattle and horse club organized by the villagers, which is extremely brave. Kailu is the Cui Xingwu Brigade and other righteous armies. Lingnan is the special operations team organized by Guo, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, which has a strong strength. Zhu Jiqing is also in a certain place in the county.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Forming a Puppet Army Aims to Invade Jehol <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>A certain gentleman arrived in Ping yesterday from Shenyang. According to reports, the Japanese recently used the powerful momentum of the Righteous Army to seek permanent stability and re-establish the remnants of the Zhilu Army, Cheng Guorui and Li Jichun. They bought out disappointed military officers from inside and outside Guanwai to form two armies, as the vanguard for the future invasion of Jehol and the southward attack. Now the Japanese army has appointed Cheng as the commander of the First Army. Gathering his old troops in Shenyang, he has obtained more than 400 people. Classes are held for training twice a day at Zhang Jinghui's private residence (No. 5 Dongling). It is planned to transfer this part to Suizhong in the future, specializing in dealing with the Righteous Army. Li Jichun is the commander of the Second Army, Li Xixi is the deputy, and Fang Yongchang is the chief of staff. The entire army is stationed in the Jinzhou Lianshan area. The organization of the puppet army is that each army has six detachments, each detachment has 3,000 people, a total of 18,000 people. Each person is given an enlistment fee of three yuan before enlisting, and each army is allocated 10,000 yuan for supplies, and must be organized into an army within three months. Each detachment is also assigned six Japanese instructors who are responsible for managing finances and providing guidance.</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese also have the following plans to assist the puppet army: 1) The East Asian Ethnic Alliance, which was previously formed by the Japanese army in the Northeast, allows Japanese and Chinese traitors to join the association, specializing in training military and political talents. Recently, General Muto transferred all the personnel of this department into the two armies to serve as cadres. 2) The Japanese army decided to spend 30 million to buy out all the Righteous Army in the Northeast. 3) The Japanese sent Mr. Okazaki as the chief representative to Tianjin secretly. He is currently living in a certain Japanese hotel in the Japanese Concession, specializing in contacting frustrated military officers in our country and recruiting bandit troops in the Pingjin area. Meetings are held in the hotel once a day. 4) Organizing the Jing'an Guerrilla, which has now been opened and stationed in the Suizhong Xingcheng area, specializing in dealing with the local Righteous Army. 5) The Japanese forced the villagers in the counties west of Liaoning to build gun towers and trenches to prevent Yangyong's army. 6) Xu Tian, the former Japanese instructor of the Northeast Jiangwutang, is now convening frustrated military officers from the former Northeast Jiangwutang and promising them the treatment of a school officer to prepare them to participate in the one or two puppet armies.</p>
<h3 id="e85">A Major Offensive is Expected Before the Lunar New Year <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from a certain society in Ping City, in order to understand the actual situation on the edge of Jehol, recently went to Tianjin to meet a certain important person stationed in Jehol. According to reports, since the September 18th Incident last year, the Japanese have included Jehol Province into the three eastern provinces and changed Jehol to Xing'an Province. In February this spring, a part of the Japanese Kwantung Army was transferred to implement the attack on Jehol. Our side strengthened defenses in Chaoyang County and implemented resistance on one side. The Japanese saw that our defenses were very strict. Armored vehicles, tanks, and cannons were all unsuccessful in combat in Jehol. In addition, the Japanese army was not familiar with the terrain. Jehol Province is mostly high mountains and ridges, so they began to buy out bandits, traitors, hooligans, and Mongolian bandits as tools for attacking Jehol. Our side repeatedly reported to the military leaders stationed in various counties about the collusion between the Japanese army and the Mongolian bandits, and immediately added precautions. Many traitors have been captured one after another, including the giant Kui Bi Zhanyi, who was captured and shot by Dong Brigade Commander (Futing) at Chaoyang Temple in October. Most of the traitors have fled in fear of crime. Although the Japanese have purchased Mongolian bandits in counties such as Dalou, Jingpeng, Lingyuan, and Lingnan, they intend to launch at the same time and disturb the rear of Jehol Province. Fortunately, the Mongolian flags and princes all strictly instructed their subordinates not to act rashly. Therefore, most of the Mongolian bandits purchased by the Japanese at the border between Chaoyang and Kailu County have no combat capability. Now the Japanese are eager to attack Jehol. These untrained Mongolian bandits are all sent to the front. The Japanese army uses machine guns and cannons in the rear to suppress them. Those who do not advance are killed, and those who retreat in battle will have their Han traitor commanders shot. Therefore, there must be several cases of people fleeing back to our side every day. Those who have been fighting with the Righteous Army in Chaoyang and Kailu for several days are all the puppet salvation army led by Han traitors, so they have repeatedly been defeated. Every time the Japanese see the puppet army retreating in defeat, they will transfer the Japanese army in the rear to the front line. Therefore, the Righteous Army has to retreat because it is unable to respond in time. It is said that the Japanese plan to invade Jehol this time is to first take Chaoyang and then advance towards Jehol Province from Chaoyang. However, our army's strength in Chaoyang is very strong. Although Japanese planes fly to Chaoyang County from time to time for reconnaissance, they are only showing off their power, and the bombs have no effect. Because the villages in Chaoyang have become deserted, and the fields and houses have long been bombed by Japanese aircraft. Recently, Dong Brigade Commander, the frontline garrison commander of Chaoyang County, repeatedly sent telegrams reporting that our army stationed in the county has not yet come into contact with the Japanese army, but the Japanese definitely have the ambition to attack Jehol before the Lunar New Year. According to a secret report from the county, the Japanese have continuously transported a large number of troops from Mianzhou in recent days, numbering about 5,000. They are now stationed at the Suizhong County station, and a large number of military supplies have been transported here. The Japanese transport team is brought from Liaoning, because they are afraid that our people will carry it and leak secrets. It is now reported that the former Kwantung Commander Honjo Shigeru, etc., plan to come to Jehol after the new calendar year to inspect the area. At that time, it may be the start of the war. Recently, the chief of staff dispatched by the Japanese, Ko Iso, etc., have been traveling back and forth between Jinzhou and Suizhong for deployment. (December 26)</p>

<h3 id="e87">The Recovery of Anyuan County, Jiangxi Province <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Pseudo 20th Army Almost Completely Annihilated - The Provincial Government Commended the Former Magistrate of Xunwu</p>
<p>A dispatch from Nanchang reports that a porter who escaped from the bandit area of Nanfeng said, "Zhu, Mao, and Peng held a pseudo-people's conference on the border of Shaowu last month and spoke to the crowd, saying that in the future, the Red Army will follow the 'Four No-Fight Principles', that is, they will not fight when the National Army is powerful, they will not fight when the fortifications are strong, they will not fight when the sacrifices are too great, and they will not fight when the place is too poor. The pseudo-135 Army Corps consists of no more than ten thousand people, many of whom are children aged twelve or thirteen. They have dirty heads and faces, wear single clothes and barefoot, and have breakfast but no lunch. They eat today but do not know what they will eat tomorrow." From this, we can see the true nature of the Red Bandits. Zhu, Mao, Peng, and other bandits all failed in their recent westward attacks on Fuzhou and Jianchang, eastward attacks on Guangze and Shaowu, and northward peeks into western Zhejiang. The bandit nests on the border of southeastern Jiangxi and northwestern Fujian have been completely exhausted of grass roots and tree bark since the Nationalist Army of the four provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang jointly blockaded them. The pseudo-village Soviets of Ruijin and Changting urgently urged the payment of land taxes. Residents were either dead or fled. The bandit army had no way to plunder. Like hungry rats emerging from their holes, Chen Yi's unit of the pseudo-20th Army in southern Jiangxi was sent to Anliao to loot Longnan, Qiannan, and Dingnan.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, Yu Hanmou, the commander of the First Army of Guangdong in southern Jiangxi, made strict arrangements in advance. The Wang Zanbin Division of the Gui Army served as the middle route and was assigned to attack the front of Anyuan. The Ye Zhao Department of the Second Division of the Guangdong Army flanked the left side of the bandits from Xinfeng. The Chen Zhang Department of the Independent Second Brigade encircled the right side of the bandits. On the 19th of this month, they advanced to the vicinity of Anyuan. They engaged in fierce battles with the bandits outside the city. The Nationalist Army advanced bravely and fiercely, killing many bandits. The bandits retreated in a panic to the east. At that time, Xie Zheng's regiment of the Third Army in Xunwu and Li Hanhun's unit of the Independent Third Division received Yu Hanmou's telegram ordering them to block the area. When the bandits fled to Bentiao, dozens of miles west of Xunwu County, they were cut off by Xie Zheng's regiment. The bandits were trapped in the core area. Just as they were breaking through the encirclement and fighting fiercely, Li Hanhun's division also arrived and joined the coordination. The bandit army was fragmented and scattered, unable to escape. Those who could not escape surrendered their weapons. As a result, Anyuan was recovered by Guangdong and Guangxi on the 20th. After Yu Hanmou received the telegram reporting the recovery of Ancheng, he considered that the county was located in a remote area on the border of Guangdong, had been occupied by bandits for a long time, the people's livelihood was exhausted, and the area was devastated. It was essential to have someone responsible for rescuing the dead and healing the wounded. He specially appointed Lai Jianhou, a counselor of the First Army Headquarters, as the magistrate of Anyuan County to handle the aftermath. In addition to telegraphing the headquarters of the three provinces' suppression of bandits on the 21st to report the victory, Yu also telegraphed the provincial government to appoint Lai as the magistrate of the county to take full responsibility, and allocated funds to provide urgent relief.</p>
<p>The former Magistrate of Xunwu County, Pan Mengchun, died in battle against the bandits in the county in March. His son, Pan Zuoyun, was also captured and killed because he was a staff member of the county government. The provincial government specially provided condolences and funeral expenses of 2,000 yuan, in accordance with the cases of Ji Gongquan, the Magistrate of Anfu County, and Wu Zhaofeng, the Magistrate of Xinfeng County, who died in the maintenance of the border, to comfort the loyal souls.

<p>Going to Ningxia to Assume the Position of Chairman, Mr. Ma's Talk When Passing Through Jinan</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan states that Ma Hongkui, Chairman of the Ningxia Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the 15th Route Army, arrived in Jinan by car from Nanjing, intending to go to Ningxia to take office. The car arrived in Jinan at 7:30 PM today (the 27th). The provincial government secretary-general Zhang Shaotang, finance minister Tu Xiangce, headquarters chief of staff Liu Shuxiang, staff section chief Zhang Guoxuan, provincial capital public security bureau Wang Kairu, and pistol brigade commander Lei Taiping all arrived at the station to welcome him. Ma got out of the car and shook hands with the greeters one by one, then made a statement to the press, saying that he had left Beijing last night and planned to meet with Chairman Han after arriving in Beiping. He would stay in Ping for a few days and would not return to Xinyang. After half of the troops had been sent to Ningxia, he would go to Ningxia to take office. The troops he was taking were the Lu Zhongliang, Ma Baolin, and Ma Yingcai brigades. The cavalry brigade remained in Henan, with brigade commander Ma Xiaojiao temporarily acting as commander-in-chief, waiting for his elder brother (Ma Hongbin) to arrive and take over. The troops would begin to move tomorrow and the day after. They would get off the train in Baotou and walk, and it would take another two weeks to arrive. He had left Ningxia in the winter of the 15th year of the Republic and had been away for several years. This time in Beijing, he had expressed to Chairman Chiang that he would maintain the current situation in the short term. When the central government had concrete plans for the northwest in the future, he planned to go abroad to see. Regarding Ningxia, the 7th Division was currently stationed there. Opium prohibition in Gansu was very difficult. Planting was too widespread. If the people did not grow opium, they would have nothing to live on. If the people were not allowed to grow it, other troops would also grow it, which was impossible. A few days ago, his troops laid off four or five thousand people. In addition to the old and weak, the disabled and those injured in suppressing bandits accounted for 2,000 people. Most of his troops were from Gansu, with Gansu people accounting for 80-90% of the officers and 30% of the soldiers. When he was a company commander, the troops he led were not only from one county, but also from one township. When he went home, the fathers and elders invited him to their homes on the 50-mile road from the county seat to his hometown. Fathers asked him for their sons, and wives asked him for their husbands. There were cries everywhere along the way until he got home at night. If he went back this time, he thought there would be even more people asking for people. He was overwhelmed with emotion. At 8:30, Mr. Ma boarded the train and headed north. (December 27)</p>

<p>The Third Jiangsu Provincial Representatives' Assembly held its fifth general meeting today (the 29th) at 10:00 AM. One hundred and six representatives from various counties attended. After Chairman Xu Yongji opened the meeting, he reported: (A) Regarding the report on the administrative work of various agencies, due to the central instructor Hong Ludong's departure for Beijing last night, there were no concrete measures yet. (It is heard that the provincial government, due to the excessive questioning of the Civil Affairs Director by the representatives the previous day, considered it exceeding the scope and expressed imprudent words, and had sent a letter to the presidium of the assembly yesterday, stating that it would be inconvenient to attend. Therefore, the heads of various provincial departments have suspended reporting on their work for the past two days. This matter is currently being mediated by the central instructor Hong Ludong). The agenda is now changed, and the report is postponed. (B) The date of visiting the mausoleum has not yet been decided and will be notified after the decision. After the report, the motions were discussed. (1) The motion to effectively improve the water conservancy of the Jiangbei Canal was resolved to be handed over to a special committee. (2) The motion to request that the name of the district party headquarters be uniformly called the county party headquarters was resolved to be handed over to the next executive committee for handling. (3) The motion to effectively promote district autonomy and complete the political tutelage work in this province was resolved to be passed as it stands, and the next executive committee will send a letter to the provincial government to effectively implement it. (4) The motion to request the central government to complete the Huai River diversion project as soon as possible to maintain the people's livelihood was resolved to be passed. (5) The motion to set a deadline for the completion of county roads in various counties was resolved to be passed.</p>
<p>The sixth general meeting was held at 2:30 PM, with 124 representatives present, and Chairman Sheng Xiru continued to discuss the motions.

<h3 id="e90">Opinion Paper on the Huai River Diversion Project by Engineering Experts from the League of Nations (Continued) <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The undersigned have been shown many broken maps of the Huai River in the west, and have also been instructed on the methods for setting the height of embankment gradients and embankment distances at specified locations. From this, we know that everything has been carefully planned, allocating the necessary commercial area to prevent the largest flood volume in history.</p>
<p>However, in order to suit these conditions, the embankment distance should be extremely wide. Buying land is obviously not feasible given the current economic situation. Therefore, in the first phase, the Huai River Diversion Committee had to reluctantly implement a less-than-ideal plan, limiting its work to repairing existing embankments and constructing new embankments near the Huai River, with a distance of only half a kilometer to one kilometer, and a top height slightly lower than the one that should be built.</p>
<p>The Huai River embankment construction plan currently being implemented, approximately 400 kilometers downstream of the Honghekou, does not include the length of the embankments of various tributaries. Judging from the list, approximately 50 percent of the extraordinary flood volume of 1921 or 1931 (year 10 and year 20 of the Republic of China) can be contained between the embankments.</p>
<p>Within this limited flood discharge range, the undersigned, after examining the completion of this portion of the plan, can prove its perfection and effectiveness. To prevent the vast area of arable land that has been flooded in the past from being affected by floods, it can be seen that repairing the Huai River embankment and handling the flood discharge on Hongze Lake are urgent tasks. After all the above-mentioned projects are carried out, the frequent floods and droughts of the past can be avoided.</p>
<p>As for the Shanghai tributaries of the Huai River, and the proposed corrections and inclusions in several places, the undersigned suggest that before any engineering is implemented, the possible effects on the Huai River's flow and the rate of runoff and water scenery from the affiliated water receiving areas should be carefully considered.</p>
<p>The committee members further suggest that the proposed direct engineering through Gaozhuang near Shuanggou on Hongze Lake to shorten the Huai flow should not be carried out until after precise measurements of the water surface height at both ends of the proposed excavation during floods. Establishing the height of the two exhaustion surfaces proves that there is insufficient benefit to justify the use of engineering as we have deduced. Furthermore, this matter may be found to be rocky or interspersed with extremely difficult-to-excavate soil during the preliminary work necessary, making it difficult to implement.</p>
<p>After discussing the upper reaches of the Huai River, the undersigned now mention that the river at the current Bengbu railway bridge must be expanded.</p>
<p>As for the Hongze Lake Huai River Diversion Committee's plan to build embankments around the lake to increase the existing capacity of this natural reservoir, so that during short flood periods, a portion that cannot be safely discharged can be retained in the middle, the plan is to maintain the lake level at 13.60 meters above the Yellow River zero point after each major flood discharge. According to this calculation, the volume between the above-mentioned water level and 12.50 meters, or 11.00 meters, the lowest drop in the upstream drought, is sufficient for irrigation until the next spring and summer flood. At any time, the lake water must be lowered to 12.50 meters before the next upstream flood, if necessary, using the proposed movable dam at Jiangba to control it.</p>
<p>During the flood season, the amount of lake water discharged should be adjusted to suit the discharge capacity of the downstream. The excess water is stored in the lake, as mentioned above. During extraordinary floods, the maximum flood volume is determined to be 15,000 cubic meters per second. The Huai River Diversion Committee plans to discharge 5,000 to 6,000 cubic meters of lake water per second during this period, depending on the water level of the Yangtze River at the time. According to this, the water level in the lake will gradually increase, the former reaching a maximum of 15.65 meters, and the latter reaching 16.10 meters. The Hongze Lake surrounding embankment is built to 1.50 meters above the flood level.</p>
<p>The undersigned express their approval of the plan, and feel that it not only solves the Huai River flood control problem, but also the shipping and irrigation problems. The land within the lake embankment below 13.60 meters will inevitably be submerged and cannot be cultivated. However, everyone knows that this is all unowned land. In any case, the benefits of shipping and irrigation downstream of Hongze are related to the country and are more important.</p>
<p>Currently, the Huai River flood water discharged from Hongze Lake is unadjusted, and its main outlet passes through the Sanhe and Gaobao-Xian-Shaobo lakes. There is also the Zhangma River that flows from Hongze Lake into the canal, and the Liuzha and Shaobo Lake water merge. Then, each stream flows through the five diversion canals and into the Yangtze River. In years of high water, due to the obstructed tail, the water cannot be discharged to its full extent, and the banks of the canal east and west break, and the vast fields are submerged. Some water remains all year round, causing great disasters. If the Yangtze River can conveniently accept the flood volume, it has not been proven that it cannot temporarily accommodate more water. Therefore, the Huai River Diversion Committee plans to control the amount of lake water discharged to suit the downstream situation, while still maintaining the original Sanjiangying inlet as the main flood discharge channel, and using direct access to the sea as a supplement.</p>
<p>Before commenting on the Huai River Diversion Committee's plan, the undersigned can now state that after on-site inspections and careful research on the proposed indirect or direct access to the sea waterways, we have not seen any economical or complete method that can be used to achieve the main purpose of the diversion. Therefore, except for the future possibility of using the access to the sea waterway to discharge a small portion of the flood water as a way to increase safety, the undersigned feel that this plan does not need further research.</p>
<p>In order to regulate the discharge of lake water, it is proposed to build a movable dam near Jiangba to control the flow of lake water through the Sanhe and Gaobao lakes, and below the newly built ship lock in Shaobo. If so, the Huai River flood water between Hongze Lake and Shaobo will be controlled within a single established waterway. The west embankment of the canal will no longer be as dangerous as it has been, and it can be seen that the existing ports on the west embankment do not need to be protected and should be permanently blocked during construction. Although the undersigned all agree with the plan, we believe that there is no special increase in the amount of flood discharge achieved by building double embankments in Gaobao Lake to form a river channel. Therefore, we recommend that this part of the plan be given more precise study before implementing this extremely costly project.</p>
<p>As for the movable dam to be built in Jiangba to discharge the maximum amount of 9,000 cubic meters per second, it is estimated that a total width of 600 meters of sluice gates must be installed. The appropriate style and method of operation of the sluice gates must be determined based on the results of a complete examination of the dam site. Regarding this point, as well as the addresses of other proposed dams mentioned above, the undersigned feel that it is necessary to carry out thorough and precise drilling to determine the nature of the underlying geological layers before proceeding with the construction of the planned dam project. The undersigned have been informed of the drilling methods that have been used there, but feel that the results obtained or the degree of accuracy are still open to discussion. For such an important project to be undertaken, the undersigned consider it necessary to first use a four-inch soil drill to penetrate the ground and then recover a layer of oil to extract the central tube for examination, and record the depth.</p>
<p>Within the Zhangma River discharge channel of Hongze Lake, the Huai River Diversion Committee is planning to build a ship lock near Huaiyin to regulate flood discharge, realign the canal, rebuild the Zhiji Dam as a discharge gate, and build several diversion canals. The undersigned believe that the plan will achieve its intended purpose, but we recommend that if the proposed ship lock is moved southwest about two miles, so that it is located in a place where only a shorter new river channel is needed, the cost will be greatly saved.</p>
<p>In addition, the flood control problem related to the eastern part of the Shandong Canal requires the waters of the Si River, Yi River, and Shu River, the current state of which is deeply related to the flood situation of the Canal and its surroundings. The Huai River Diversion Committee plans to dredge the above-mentioned rivers separately, so that each has a tail outlet to discharge flood water, while allocating and supplying water to the central canal for shipping and irrigation needs. The undersigned feel that this is very appropriate.</p>
<p>In the preceding sections, the undersigned have reluctantly described the important issues arising from the improvement of the current state of the Huai River. Flood control is the main goal and has been satisfactorily resolved, while the convenience of Huai shipping, irrigation, and increased traffic is easy to achieve. Therefore, the undersigned recommend that the following projects should be held first and should not be delayed: (1) the movable dam at Jiangba, (2) the ship lock at Shaobo and the necessary repairs to the west embankment of the Canal, (3) the ship lock near Huaiyin and the reconstruction of the Xiji Dam as a discharge gate, (4) the surrounding embankment of Hongze Lake.</p>
<p>In addition, special attention should be paid to diverting the Shandong Si River flood water into Hongze Lake to reduce the problems of the current state of the Canal, and it is proposed that the Liudong ship lock be completed as soon as possible. After the above-mentioned projects are completed and the embankments to be built in the upper reaches of the Huai River are continued, the flood control problem can be definitively resolved, and the drought situation today will be greatly improved, and the river bank on the six floodgates will be opened. Therefore, before concluding, the undersigned would like to briefly offer their opinion on the design of the shipping ship lock to be built in the Canal. We believe that it may be beneficial to review it. That is, in the preliminary design of the Huai River Diversion Committee, the entrance width of the ship lock is set at eleven meters. After investigating the dimensions of the largest ships currently navigating in the Canal, the width restrictions of the waterway, and the water depth obtained during the dry season after the increase in shipping convenience, the undersigned believe that this width is too large and can be reduced to eight or nine meters, which would greatly save costs. Regarding this issue, the undersigned can cite the Beicang ship lock project, which is currently being handled by the Hai River Improvement Committee in the Yongding River management plan and has recently been completed. The undersigned recommend that the responsible design and construction personnel of the ship lock to be built in the Canal go to examine the details of the case, which would be extremely useful.

<p>Yang Su, a farmer in the Xiaoyouche area of the Second District, is 81 years old, owns over 100 mu of land, and has several thousand yuan in cash. She only has two daughters, both of whom are married. One daughter died after marriage. Because she had no male heir, she adopted a son with a different surname, Yang Mengsheng, but she did not get along with Mengsheng and treated him like a stranger. She was also unwilling to provide for her nephew Yang Guisheng and Yang Guilin, and planned to give all of her property to her daughters, which aroused resentment from Mengsheng, Guisheng, and Guilin. The day before yesterday afternoon, Mengsheng and others suddenly reported that their home had been robbed the previous night, and Yang Su had been murdered. The district office immediately forwarded the letter to the Zhubqiao Public Security Fifth Branch, and Branch Chief Kang Fasheng went to investigate. There were no signs of a break-in. Branch Chief Kang found many suspicious points in the case and reported it to the county government to send personnel to the countryside for examination. It was discovered that there was a rope mark around Yang Su's neck, and it seemed that she had been strangled to death with a rope, which was very suspicious. The county sent Zhao Cheng, an investigating officer, and Zheng Yue, along with four police officers, secretly to investigate by small Huinan Wheel last night, and ordered the police to summon Yang Mengsheng and others to wait for interrogation. However, Yang Mengsheng had already fled. Only his wife, Zhang, and the local clerk, Zhu Jinkang, were summoned. They were immediately taken to the county for interrogation.</p>

<p>Due to a dispute over the election of provincial representatives in this county, the central government ordered the provincial party headquarters to send Hu Yuzhang to Cheng to handle the election. Later, because Executive Committee member Xue Chan and others were all in the province and unable to hold a meeting, and because the time was short and there was not enough time for an election, Hu Yuzhang telegraphed the province for instructions. On the 26th, he received a telegram from the provincial party headquarters stating that the central instructor, Hong Ludong, had a solution to the Cheng election dispute and that there was no need to hold an election. Hu returned to the province immediately. The solution is still that Xue Chan, Chen Lan, and Chen Xiping (Second District) will attend, and Xu Jiangci will replace Xie Wenzhan (First District). There are also electoral disputes in 17 other counties, and it is planned that the provincial representatives' assembly will discuss and decide on a proper solution.</p>

<p>Ge Lin, a well-known drug dealer in Yangjian Town, which belongs to Liantang in the Seventh District, was wanted for a case in the past. He lived in another town, but recently returned to Yangjian to resume his drug business. Because it is located at the intersection of Changshu and Wuxi, the business is very prosperous. About half a month ago, he secretly went to Shanghai and ordered more than ten boxes of opium and more than ten packages of medicinal pills, with a value of about 200,000 yuan. He hired Xu Genlin, a boatman from this county, to transport them back to Changshu. The matter was not kept secret and was discovered by someone, who reported it to the Liantang Public Security Branch. The branch immediately sent police to wait at the road about two miles away. On the afternoon of the 27th, when the boat arrived, it was immediately intercepted, and the drug dealer Ge Lin, boatman Xu Genlin, and two boatmen were arrested. After the incident, Pan Lin hired someone to mediate the matter, so it was kept secret from the outside world.

<p>All the teachers and staff in this county have been owed too much salary, with some owing more than ten months, and newly owed salaries also amounting to three months. With the new year approaching, and the county government not intending to pay salaries, all teachers and staff gathered at the Experimental Elementary School at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 26th) and went to the county government with Zhao Huan, the education bureau official, to demand payment of salaries. County Magistrate Li made excuses and said that there was no money to pay. The teachers and staff representatives, led by Zhan Guangzuo, refuted him one by one. County Magistrate Li was silent at first, and then suddenly said that it did not matter if they stopped teaching. The teachers and staff left on this pretext and returned to the Experimental Elementary School, where they drafted a telegram to the provincial education department to request instructions. It is also reported that Bureau Director Fang has also telegraphed the education department to resign. The county government and the education community have each gone to extremes, with no room for resolution. They are awaiting instructions from the department.</p>

<p>To the Editor: On Friday, December 25th, your newspaper published an article stating that Anhui Security Team Mutinied and Fled to Zhejiang Province. Yesterday, Chief Zhang of the Anhui Provincial Security Department received a telegram from Anhui Security Department Chief Zhang Dingxun stating: "According to a telegram from Zhou Junnan, the commander of the Ninth Security District of the province, a mutiny occurred in the Ningguo Security Team, and more than 30 people fled to Shiku, Dongxiang. This place connects with Zhejiang Province, and it is feared that they may flee to Zhejiang. Please telegraph Zhejiang Province to send troops to strictly block the escape routes." Check with the Ningguo County Magistrate Su Jianheng, who reported by telegram: "A part of the Second Security Company stationed in the city mutinied. Teams have been dispatched to encircle and suppress them, and neighboring counties have been telegraphed to block key points. More than ten soldiers were coerced and have each carried out their own troops. There are only seven mutinous soldiers, and they have all scattered in all directions. The situation has been reported everywhere." The above does not match your newspaper's report. In order to avoid misleading people, we specially request that you make a correction. Anhui Provincial Security Department, December 26th.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Chairman Zhang Junguang of the National Salvation Association is Missing <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Received Threatening Letters Several Days Ago</p>
<p>Searched Everywhere, But There is Still No Trace</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that Zhang Junguang, the executive director of the National Salvation Associations of All Circles, has been actively involved in the anti-Japanese movement. He has previously received many threatening letters from the so-called Protection Corps and the Sino-Japanese Greater Harmony Association, which he dismissed with a smile. However, he suddenly disappeared the day before yesterday (the 28th). There is much suspicion that the clues are related to the previous letters. He is very filial to his parents and would never leave without saying goodbye. Here are the details of the situation:</p>
<h3 id="e110">Disappearance Details <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>On the 28th, at around 10 AM, Mr. Zhang bid farewell to his mother and left, mentioning he was going to the Bankers' Association for a special publication advertisement for the National Salvation Association, and to meet with Mr. Lin (Kanghou). He said if he couldn't return home for lunch, he would definitely notify them by phone. However, the family waited until 1:30 PM, but there was no phone call, causing great anxiety. Because Mr. Zhang was filial to his parents and always informed them before leaving and returned on time, he had never been overdue, causing his mother to wait anxiously. The previous day, they waited until dinner but he didn't return, so they sent people out in all directions to search for him. For two days now, there has been no trace of him. The two elderly Mr. and Mrs. Zhang have only this son, and they don't know if he is safe or in danger, causing them to faint several times.</p>
<h3 id="e111">A Brief Biography of Mr. Zhang <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang is from a prominent family in Nanhui, Jiangsu. He studied in Japan in his early years and engaged in revolutionary work. In the 16th year of the Republic, he served as the Shanghai General Commander. Mr. Zhang Jun Guang Xiao Ying</p>
<p>He made great contributions to the recapture of Shanghai. Later, he fought in the Jianghuai area, serving as a division and brigade commander. After the Jinan Incident, he returned to Shanghai in anger, dedicating himself to mass movements, such as the dockworkers' union, the United Party Affairs Committee, the Chinese Benevolent Association, and as a member of the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association. He is currently the Standing Director and Chairman of the National Federation of National Salvation Organizations.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Mr. Tu's Conversation <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>A reporter asked Mr. Tu Liang, the Secretary-General of the association, about the circumstances before his disappearance. According to him, Mr. Zhang was amiable and treated people with sincerity. He adhered to the "Four Don'ts" – no prostitution, no gambling, no smoking, and no deception – and often advised his friends accordingly. On the 27th morning, I (Tu himself) had a conversation with Mr. Zhang for about an hour, during which he expressed his extreme heartache over the loss of the Northeast for more than a year. He relied on the volunteer army to maintain the situation, but they were gradually running out of strength, and Rehe was in danger, Japanese goods were being dumped. If they didn't intensify their efforts to support the volunteer army and stir up public excitement, the future would be unimaginable. Mr. Zhang was always courageous and resolute in his actions. This sudden disappearance is likely due to enemy machinations. He hoped all sectors would rise up to rescue him, to avoid repeating the tragedy of Xiang Songmao, and so on.</p>

<p>To Mr. Jun Guang,</p>
<p>Since the establishment of our alliance, the people of China and Japan have discussed and recognized that the ill feelings from the Eastern Provinces Incident were caused by warlords of both countries, with no other reason. Our Chinese and Japanese people share a deep understanding and wish to join hands to create a nation with shared prosperity and shared disgrace in East Asia. Mr. Zhang, as a representative of the Chinese people, will surely be [willing to] fully understand this. We hope you will understand this. For the sake of cooperation between the peoples of our two countries, all groups that foster animosity between the two countries should be abolished. The National Salvation Association led by Mr. Zhang should immediately cease its work to allow our alliance to carry out mutually beneficial affairs. We hope you will accept this good advice for the sake of the interests of the peoples of our two countries. We hereby issue this warning, otherwise, we will have no choice but to take appropriate measures.</p>

<p>Zhang Xiaolin and Four Others Elected as Chinese Directors</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association held its second delegate congress at its hall on Ximen Road yesterday at 3:00 PM to elect Chinese directors and discuss association affairs. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Attending Delegates <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>

<p>The meeting was opened with a bell, and Chairman Du Yuesheng respectfully read the Prime Minister's will and reported the purpose of the meeting. Then, Vice Chairmen Cheng Zhusun and Shang Mu Jiang reported on the association's affairs, briefly stating that the association's re-election of Chinese directors to the French Municipal Council was based on the implementation of the second term of democratically elected directors according to the association's constitution. Chinese directors must be produced by the delegate congress, so today's second second delegate congress is entirely for the election of democratically elected Chinese directors to the second term of the French Municipal Council. In addition, matters concerning the association's operations will be discussed separately. The number of attendees has exceeded two-thirds, which is sufficient for a quorum. It can be said that the citizens attach great importance to democratically elected Chinese directors, which is fortunate for the association's future. After the members publicly elect tellers and ballot counters, the election will begin immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Election of Chinese Directors <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>

<p>After the election was completed, the discussion began. 1) The Chairman reported that there are five Chinese directors attending the Municipal Council and nine Chinese committee members attending the Public Works Bureau.

In the future, all association affairs should be handled by Chairman Du to strive for social happiness. 4) Chairman Du stated that for all future congresses, he will be responsible, and all association affairs should be handled by the two chairmen, Cheng and Shang. The members asked Chairman Du to continue to be responsible and not fail the citizens' trust.

<h3 id="e119">Public Works Bureau Director Idetera Ill <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Rumors of Resignation in Japanese Newspapers are Untrue</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's information office announced that the Shanghai Daily News reported yesterday that the Public Works Bureau's Japanese director, Mr. Idetera (one of the two Japanese directors), had resigned from his position due to dissatisfaction with the negotiations on the boundary road issue. This is completely untrue. Mr. Idetera is currently ill, and according to his doctor, he needs two to three months of recuperation to recover.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Labor Strike at Lulin Pond Hinders Hunan Goods from Arriving in Shanghai <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Lulin Pond in Hunan is an important location for transporting Hunan goods. This winter, the water level in Hunan has receded, and riverboats cannot travel there, but there are many goods being exported. Various shipping companies have sent tugboats to carry them. However, last week, the dockworkers at the port demanded higher wages, but the management refused. The workers united and went on strike, stopping the loading and unloading of goods. As a result, shipping between Hunan and Shanghai has also been affected.</p>
<p>Rushing to Load Merchandise: Merchants usually rush to load and clear all goods before the end of the lunar year to close out the year. Merchants who have ordered Hunan goods are sending more tugboats to compete to transport them to Shanghai. Therefore, various shipping companies in Shanghai have increased the number of iron barges on the Hunan-Shanghai route and sent them to Lulin Pond to load goods for transport. China Merchants, San Bei, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and others have all sent shallow-water boats to Changsha to load bulk grains.</p>
<p>Detaining Ships Dispute: When various shipping companies' tugboats arrived at Lulin to load goods, a labor strike occurred. The merchants, due to time constraints, could not delay for long, so they obtained the consent of the various shipping companies and ordered the iron barges to sail to Huangmaotan to hire workers to load. However, this provoked resistance from the striking workers, who united with armed comrades and seized China Merchants San Bei Company's barge No. 8, forcibly detaining it and preventing it from loading. Other companies' boats arriving at Lulin were also detained, causing a major dispute.</p>
<p>Petitioning for a Government Office: Since the various shipping companies' barges were detained and goods could not be unloaded, the merchants became even more anxious. Yesterday, a telegram was sent stating that the Hunan branches of China Merchants and San Bei, together with representatives of the merchants, went to the Hunan Provincial Government to request a solution to stop the workers from detaining ships and obstructing transportation, so as not to hinder shipping, stop merchandise, and affect the market. The workers, upon receiving this news, also gathered at the government office to petition, putting forward their demands to counter the management. The unrest is currently escalating fiercely, and how it will be resolved is still unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Banks and Money Houses to Close for New Year's Day <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>All financial and commercial establishments in Shanghai will be closed on New Year's Day, 1933, to celebrate. As the date approaches, it is urgent to make arrangements. It was heard yesterday that the money houses have already decided to close for New Year's Day and the 2nd, resuming business on the 3rd and handling collections and settlements as usual. However, the banks have not been able to reach a consensus. Some will close for three days, while others will follow the example of the money houses and close for two days. For example, the banks on the Bund must close for four days to make up for the Sunday holiday. Therefore, it is expected that the entire industry will not resume business until the 5th.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Two Railway Bureau Directors Hosted the Press Yesterday Afternoon <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Reporting on the Current Situation and Improvement Plans</p>
<p>Huang Boqiao, the director of the Jinpu and Huning Railways, invited reporters from various newspapers and news agencies to the bureau's conference room at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on everything. About twenty reporters from various newspapers attended. Director Huang and Deputy Director Wu Shaozeng first reported, and then asked the reporters to contribute their opinions on the accumulated problems of the railway and the areas that should be improved, based on what they had heard and seen on weekdays. Director Huang personally answered them, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The reports of the two directors, Huang and Wu, are detailed below:</p>
<h3 id="e123">The Economic Situation of the Two Railways <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Director Huang reported, "Since I took office according to the Ministry's orders, I have been faced with the aftermath of the severe damage to the two railways and the constant unrest within the bureau. Therefore, the work of dealing with and rectifying the situation has been very cumbersome. Therefore, I have not been able to personally meet with you on several occasions, and I sincerely apologize. Now that the major issues of the bureau have been resolved to a considerable extent, I have invited you here to report in detail. I am very honored that you have graciously accepted the invitation. The operations of the two railways were very difficult even before the January 28th Shanghai Incident, because the Jinpu Railway runs parallel to the Yangtze River. The January 28th Incident caused severe damage to the two railways. The bureau was burned down, and the railway property was damaged, resulting in a direct loss of more than 8.93 million yuan and an indirect loss of more than 5.67 million yuan, totaling more than 14.6 million yuan. After the incident, on the one hand, the cost of restoration and reorganization was enormous, and on the other hand, the market was depressed and credit was extremely tight, resulting in sluggish operations and a sharp decline in revenue. The difficulties and crises of the two railways have become even more severe. Taking the major responsibilities of the two railways as an example, as of the end of November this year, the debt to the Sino-British Syndicate for principal and interest is more than 8 million yuan, the debt for the purchase of vehicles is more than 4 million yuan, the debt to Guangzhou-Kowloon is more than 200,000 yuan, and Huning owes</p>
<h3 id="e124">Another Import of Japanese Fishing Boats <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Price cuts and Dumping Disrupt the Market</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese fishing boat Osprey Maru imported twice last month, selling its catches from fishing in China's territorial waters in the Chinese market and taking the profits away. It is now reported that the Japanese fishing boat imported again on the 25th, bringing in 1,100 boxes of yellow croaker, shark, eel, etc., weighing more than 30,000 catties. To avoid attracting attention from the Chinese, the ship berthed at Yangshupu and used barges to transport the goods in, entrusting Yongmao and Shenfeng Vegetable and Fruit Shops in the 16th Concession to sell them. At that time, the price of domestic fresh bucket-headed yellow croaker was around 14 yuan per dan, while the yellow croaker imported by the Japanese fishing boat was initially priced at 6 to 8 yuan per dan, a price cut and dumping that disrupted the fish market.</p>
<p>Outstanding loan of more than 1.8 million yuan, for a total debt of more than 14 million yuan, a staggering amount. The routine operating expenses of the two railways alone require more than 630,000 yuan per month for wages. In November this year, the balance of income and expenses was still short of more than 900,000 yuan. It is now the end of December, and everything needs to be paid for, but the two railways currently have only more than 420,000 yuan in funds, which is still short of 210,000 yuan even if used entirely for wages. As for the plans for the restoration and reorganization of the two railways, including repairing bridges, building docks, adding locomotives and freight cars, replacing sleepers and steel rails, relocating and expanding various machine shops and stations, and the equipment that the bureau should add after the completion of the ferry project between Xiaguan and Pukou next year, the cost of all these is difficult to estimate. If we do not urgently raise funds, there is no hope of progress, and even maintaining the status quo will be impossible.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Future Efforts <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>As for future efforts, abstractly speaking, there are several aspects: 1) Railways are a national transportation agency, and everything must be based on serving the people. Therefore, in the future, we must eliminate all unreasonable habits and make them conform to commercialization. 2) Railways are a specialized business that requires various technical personnel everywhere, and there can be no compromise. Unless it is actually urgently needed, we will never lightly appoint anyone. Even if the business increases and we have no choice but to add people, we must conduct strict assessments, selecting people for the job and gradually not selecting jobs for people. 3) Finances must be transparent. The only way to save the two railways after the devastation is to actively increase revenue and passively save expenses. For debts, we must repay the principal and pay interest on time, without causing delays. All expenditures must be made public, and simple forms showing the financial status of each department must be prepared and made public to all colleagues of the two railways. There must be no ambiguity or perfunctoriness, so that funds are not wasted and things are done practically. 4) Actively build and improve efficiency. In addition to quickly reorganizing the damaged parts of the railway, we must actively carry out other new businesses that are related to the future development of the two railways according to the economic situation of the two railways, so that they are rationalized and commercialized. No matter what the situation, we must strive forward and not stop until we achieve our goals. Other equipment in the bureau is of great importance to work efficiency. For example, there are currently 66 locomotives, but two-thirds of them have no depot to store them, and they are exposed all day long, resulting in huge losses. Most of the workers are also working outdoors, which reduces their efficiency significantly. In the future, we will add equipment as needed to avoid the above-mentioned losses.</p>
<h3 id="e126">The Addition of a Deputy Director <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of my tenure, the Ministry of Railways also added a deputy director to assist me. Since the implementation of responsible transportation on this railway, the amount of work has doubled, and we are constantly researching and improving. Deputy Director Wu is proficient in railway cost accounting and railway management, and can cooperate and work hard, making it easier to cope with the situation. Moreover, the two railways are by no means satisfied with the status quo, and are urgently seeking reform and improvement, such as: 1) Extending the railway, planning to extend it westward from Nanjing to enter Anhui and Jiangxi, and eastward to extend the railway to Wusong, so that the products of the interior can directly reach the port and be sold to the world. 2) The ferry across the Yangtze River between Tianjin-Pukou and Jinpu Railways will be completed by the spring and summer of next year. At that time, the transportation of the two railways can be directly reached. After the completion of the above two facilities, the railway business will also increase many times. Therefore, the addition of a deputy director will greatly benefit the reform of the railway and the revitalization of the business.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Deputy Director Wu's Speech <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>After Director Huang's report, Deputy Director Wu made a report, saying that he had been ordered to assist Director Huang and would follow him and work together. The increase in current bureau affairs can be summarized in several points: 1) Responsible for transportation, 2) Important position, 3) Reorganizing debts, 4) Connecting all departments to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, 5) Investigating various freight rates to seek reform. All of the above are the efforts that must be made in the future, especially the fifth item of investigating various freight rates, which is more complicated and important. The convenience of water transportation is increasing, and the construction of highways is also actively underway. The railway's business is mainly freight transportation. However, merchants try to avoid high costs to reduce costs. If the bureau can reduce freight rates, merchants will be happy to choose it. After Deputy Director Wu's report, reporters made many suggestions and criticisms about the accumulated problems of the bureau and the areas that should be reformed. Director Huang answered them one by one.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Gan Jiehou Discusses Foreign Policy <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Central Government and Southwest Agree, Will Depart in Early Next Month to Assume New Post</p>
<p>According to the Dagong Daily, after the abolition of the foreign affairs commissioners of the southwestern provinces, the Central Government is setting up diplomatic commissioners of the five provinces to handle all matters. During the tenure of Zhu Zhaoxin, his foreign policy measures and propositions seemed to have independent signs, and often failed to proceed in line with the consistent policy of the Central Government. After Zhu Zhaoxin's sudden death from poisoning, the Central Government, in order to unify diplomacy, had a rumor of sending someone to take over. Recently, the Central Government suddenly sent Gan Jiehou, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, to take over. In order to clarify the relationship between the Central Government and the Southwest in diplomacy in the future, the Dagong Daily reporter visited Gan at his residence yesterday and inquired about everything. According to him, after the unfortunate death of Zhu Dingqing, the diplomatic commissioner of the five southwestern provinces, he suddenly received a telegram from Minister Luo on the 22nd of this month, soliciting his consent for the position of diplomatic commissioner of the five provinces. At the same time, he also received a telegram from the southwestern authorities, urging him to go. As the matter was sudden, he went to Beijing to meet with Foreign Minister Luo the day before yesterday to learn the reason. Foreign Minister Luo firmly urged him to take office immediately. As it is now a time of national crisis, the political forces in the country should be united, so he has agreed to reluctantly take on the task, but for a period of two months. He is scheduled to depart south in early next month, hoping that the Central Government's foreign policy can be understood by the southwestern provinces, and the southwestern leaders' foreign policy propositions can be adopted by the Central Government and implemented, so that foreign policy is consistent to cope with foreign aggression.</p>

<p>Colonel Hooker, the commander of the 4th Regiment of the United States Marine Corps, passed away in Shanghai. Recently, Mr. Bell, the Chairman of the Public Works Bureau, sent a letter to Lieutenant Colonel Moses, the commander of the regiment, stating that the city was shocked by the sudden death of Colonel Hooker on the eve of Christmas.

At the beginning of this year, when Shanghai was in danger, Colonel Hooker coordinated various armies to ensure safety. This contribution and virtue should be permanently remembered by the Public Works Bureau of the International Settlement. Amidst our grief, we would like to express our condolences on behalf of the Public Works Bureau to all officers and soldiers of your regiment, and to Mrs. Hooker and her family.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Companies Not Registered Must Register by the Deadline <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce and Industry Received a Notice from the Ministry of Industry</p>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce and Industry received a notice from the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating that according to Article 18 of the General Rules for Merchants, commercial establishments may not use the words "company" or similar words in their names unless they are operated as companies. This also applies to those who take over the business of a company and continue to operate it as a company. Furthermore, according to Article 5 of the Company Law, a company may not be established until it has been registered with the competent authorities in the location of its main store. In addition, according to Article 114 of the same law, a company may not issue shares until it has been registered. Furthermore, Article 231, paragraphs 1 and 6, of the same law stipulates penalties for those who do not apply for registration or illegally issue shares. Therefore, a company may not be established and may not issue shares unless it is organized in accordance with the law and has been approved for registration. Recently, it has been found that a small number of merchants in well-known provinces and cities are engaged in business, or are not organized as companies, but falsely use the name of a company, or are organized under the name of a public entity, but do not apply for registration. They should be banned according to the law. Companies that are not registered have not obtained the status of a legal person, and the type of organization has not been determined. They often call themselves limited companies, but because they are not registered, they must bear unlimited liability to the outside world. It is clear that they started business first, but because they are not registered, they cannot prevent others from imitating their brand names. The company itself suffers a lot of harm, and the directors must bear heavier responsibility. Although it is understandable that registration is delayed due to unclear procedures or inconvenient transportation, it is still not in accordance with the law. Therefore, we hereby issue another notice that all companies established in the future should apply for registration in accordance with the time limit stipulated in Article 5 of the Company Law. Those companies that have already been established but have not yet applied for registration must all apply for registration in accordance with the law before June 30th of the Republic of China. If they still fail to comply after the deadline, they will be punished immediately according to the law. Furthermore, according to Article 31 of the Company Law Implementation Regulations, after a company is registered, its registration certificate will be issued by the Ministry of Industry. According to Article 5 of the current Company Registration Rules, company registration must be confirmed after the Ministry of Industry approves and issues the certificate. Therefore, the application for registration by the company must be finally approved and issued a certificate by the Ministry in order to be considered confirmed and have legal effect. In addition to distributing and publishing the announcement in the newspaper for public knowledge, the Federation is hereby notified to inform all chambers of commerce to abide by it. This notice is hereby given.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Land Bureau Announcement: Owners Must Be Present During Land Survey <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Must Fill in the Location and Boundaries in Detail During the Survey</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau announces: In order to announce the matter, it is necessary for the owner to clearly fill in the location and boundaries of the household land when the bureau handles land survey cases, and after the date of the land survey notice, first come to the bureau to contact the location for waiting, so that the surveyor can go to the survey together. It is now found that some owners do not fill in the four boundaries of the household land, or do not contact after receiving the notice, or entrust others to act as agents, so that the boundary cannot be indicated during the survey, and there is no way to measure. There are also owners who change the communication address and fail to report the correction, so the notice cannot be delivered and is delayed. The people feel that the delay is annoying, and the bureau also feels annoyed. In order to facilitate the progress of the business, it is specially announced that the owner must fill in the household land in detail, confirm the communication address, and report to the bureau if the communication address has been changed. After receiving the land survey notice, you must come to the bureau in person to contact and wait for the location. Do not entrust others to act as agents. This is a matter of property rights, so do not delay yourself. This is announced on December 28th, 21st year of the Republic of China. Director Jin Liren.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Household Registration Plates to be Issued to Chinese Residents Starting Next Year <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>General Residents Take Note: Violations Will Be Penalized</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, regarding residents within the boundaries, stipulates that whenever a household moves into or out of the Chinese territory, they must first register with the relevant district office and obtain an investigation certificate. However, residents often lose these certificates. Therefore, the bureau has decided to switch to household registration plates starting January 15th of next year. These plates will be affixed to the doors of each household, preventing loss and facilitating inspections. The regulations for issuing household registration plates are as follows: "Regulations for Issuing Household Registration Plates (Article 1: The issuance of household registration plates in this city shall be managed by the Police Bureau in accordance with these regulations. (Article 2) The household registration plate in this city serves as the basis for random checks of the population and reporting of changes. (Article 3) The outer frame and bracket of the household registration plate will be made of enamel, measuring ten centimeters in height and eleven centimeters in width. The entire plate will have a blue background with the words "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Household Registration Plate" written horizontally in white. The plate will be covered with glass and contain a piece of paper with the address, house number, name of the head of household, occupation, age, place of origin, and number of family members. (Article 4) Household registration will be based on the household unit. Except for government agencies affiliated with the National Government, all other residents, shops, and private factories, hospitals, banks, schools, etc., must be registered. (Article 5) Each set of household registration plates will cost three silver dollars for production. After registration, a receipt will be issued and collected by the police officers dispatched by the district office. The fee will be paid by the landlord or the second landlord.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Those who refuse to pay will be fined three silver dollars. However, if the landlord does not reside in the property, the tenant may pay in advance and deduct the amount from the rent upon payment. (Article 6) Only the Police Bureau has the right to manufacture and issue household registration plates in this city. Any unauthorized manufacturing or affixing will be penalized with a fine of three silver dollars. (Article 7) After the household registration plate is affixed, both the landlord and tenant are responsible for its safekeeping. The writing on the plate must not be allowed to become blurred. If the glass on the plate is broken, the household must replace it themselves. If the metal frame is damaged or lost, the district office must be notified immediately, and the Police Bureau must be notified to remake and re-affix the plate, for which a fee of four jiao will be charged. If the paper inside the plate is damaged, the damaged paper must be submitted to the district office to apply for a replacement, for which a fee of three fen will be charged. Failure to report will result in a fine of two silver dollars. This restriction does not apply in cases of genuine disasters that could not have been prevented. (Article 8) After the household registration plate is affixed, it becomes the private property of the landlord. When a tenant moves out, they may not take it with them. However, tenants may purchase their own. (Article 9) If any changes occur in the household, the paper inside the plate must be taken out, reported to the district office, and a fee of three fen paid to apply for a replacement paper, which must be re-inserted. Failure to comply with this procedure will result in a fine of two silver dollars upon inspection. If the landlord knows and fails to report, they will be subject to the same penalty. (Article 10) When residents move, whether within the city or out of the city, they must submit the paper inside the household registration plate to their district office to obtain a relocation certificate or a move-out certificate, free of charge. Failure to comply with this procedure will result in a fine of two silver dollars upon discovery. If the landlord knows and fails to report, they will be subject to the same penalty. (Article 11) Matters not covered in these regulations may be amended at any time. (Article 12) These regulations shall come into effect upon approval by the Municipal Government."</p>
<h3 id="e136">Measures for Disaster Victims in Jiangwan to Borrow Money to Build Houses <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Approves Loans to be Issued in Three Installments Starting January of Next Year; Municipal Bank Has Already Raised 40,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Municipal Government previously instructed the Police Bureau, Public Works Bureau, and Accounting Bureau to review and propose measures regarding the petition of disaster victims in the Jiangwan district to raise funds for building houses. The bureaus have now submitted a report stating, "Regarding the joint petition, we are submitting this matter for review. The Jiangwan district disaster victims petitioned for relief, and we were ordered to review and handle the matter. We drafted four measures and jointly submitted them to the government for review. On the 4th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Headquarters of the War Zone Relief Committee stating that the first, second, and third measures proposed by our bureau and others have been approved. We were instructed to take note, etc. We have already dispatched personnel to conduct on-site surveys starting on the 30th of last month, and we held two meetings on December 9th and 14th to decide on the following measures: (1) According to the report of the municipal committee members, there are 1,015 households of disaster victims who should be provided with houses. After our bureau decided on the classification, we re-checked the original household registers and excluded those who had already built houses or had more than one remaining room that could provide temporary shelter. There are 850 households urgently awaiting housing, which matches the previous estimate of 850 households. The name lists of all households building houses and the brief lists of the number of houses to be built in each village have been compiled and submitted. (2) The Local Maintenance Committee has agreed to use 31,000 yuan for building houses for disaster victims in Jiangwan. However, the committee is still building houses on behalf of the victims, not providing funds for self-construction. In order to meet the needs of the disaster victims and avoid profiteering by middlemen, our bureau decided to provide loans in installments for construction. Since the construction methods are different, it is difficult to merge the two approaches. We decided that 202 households of disaster victims in Jian 28 Tu, Jian 22 Tu, Jian 35 Tu, Jian 26 Tu, and Jian 34 Tu will be built by the Local Maintenance Committee. The remaining 648 households will be provided with loans from the city to build houses, requiring a total of 97,200 yuan. In addition to the original 20,080 yuan war zone housing loan, an additional 69,200 yuan is needed. (3) The Local Maintenance Committee built more than 100 rooms in the Jing Miao Civilian Village. Our bureau previously planned to use the existing houses to relocate 150 nearby disaster-stricken households. However, because the houses in the Civilian Village are not suitable for farmers to live in, the Public Works Bureau approved a notice from the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee to request a joint inspection with the Security Department. If it can be used for other purposes, the government will raise funds to purchase it. We have dispatched personnel to conduct a joint inspection and found that it can be used as a barracks. The Public Works Bureau has jointly submitted a separate report to the governor for review. If the village houses are suitable for use as barracks, the purchase price can be allocated from the aforementioned 69,200 yuan. We will also instruct the municipal committee members to negotiate with the Local Maintenance Committee. If the sale price can be handled by the government, it can be incorporated into the remaining housing loans. If the Maintenance Committee still intends to allocate it themselves, they can allocate a portion of the 648 households to be built in this city at a rate of 150 yuan per household. Assuming the sale price of the Civilian Village is 20,000 yuan, if the committee needs to build it themselves, then in addition to the allocated 30,000 yuan, 200 households will be allocated to the committee for handling. This city will only need to prepare loans for 448 households. (4) According to the previous report, we requested the government to allocate 46,000 yuan, totaling 105,000 yuan, for the construction of 700 houses. At that time, we originally planned to accommodate 150 households in the Civilian Village. Now that the Civilian Village needs to be purchased for use by the Security Department, the required funds have also increased. According to the current number of households, the city treasury, including the purchase price of the Civilian Village, will raise 69,200 yuan, which is sufficient for allocation. However, the severe winter is approaching, and the people are in urgent need of rescue. The loan cannot be delayed. We plan to issue the loan in three installments on January 1st, 15th, and 31st. The first and second installments will account for two-thirds of the total 97,200 yuan, totaling 64,800 yuan. In addition to the war zone's temporary relief loan for housing construction in Jiangwan, which can be allocated first, an additional 36,800 yuan is needed. We request the government to raise and allocate the funds as soon as possible to cope with the situation. The remaining 30,000 yuan can be allocated after the charity event ends. (5) Regarding the loan method, our bureau believes that since the relief funds come from the city treasury, we should be extremely frugal and strive to benefit the disaster victims. Therefore, after conducting a household survey, we carefully drafted the loan method and plan to distribute it in three installments to prevent the loan from being diverted to other uses and failing to achieve the actual construction of houses. We plan to first compile a list of households approved for loans after a joint review with the Municipal Committee and announce it to the public. Then, the Municipal War Zone Temporary Relief Loan Office will supervise the Jiangwan District Municipal Committee members in handling the loan matters. We will prepare loan vouchers and issue them clearly to the approved households. The vouchers will be submitted to the General Loan Office for verification and issuance. When distributing the second and third installment vouchers, the municipal committee members should verify the construction progress of the household and indicate it separately before signing and issuing. Those who do not start construction after receiving the first installment of the loan will have their rights to the second and third installments of the loan revoked, and this will be indicated on the first installment loan voucher. Whether all the personnel dispatched for on-site surveys and meeting decisions are feasible, we hereby submit this together with the Jiangwan District disaster victim roster and the number of houses to be built for the governor's review and request that the Finance Bureau be ordered to raise and allocate the funds in advance and swiftly issue instructions. This is for the public good." The Municipal Government, based on the report, believes that the proposed measures are feasible and that the required funds have been discussed with the Municipal Bank, which has provided 40,000 yuan to meet the needs. Therefore, it has instructed the bureaus to comply and handle the matter properly, and has also ordered the Finance Bureau to handle it jointly.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Captains' Association Reports on the Circumstances of the Sinking of the New Fu Tai <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the news of the sinking of the New Fu Tai, a report was also received by the Chinese Merchant Marine Captains' Association at 38 Avenue Edward VII in this port and published as follows: (1) The location of the accident was HengtCbick Island, located at 30 degrees 42 minutes 45 seconds north latitude and 122 degrees 2 minutes 55 seconds east longitude. The entire crew of the ship consisted of 42 people. The captain and first mate were Russian, and the second mate was Chinese. Whether they had certificates of competency from the Ministry of Communications and whether they were legally qualified to serve as crew members is subject to investigation before a determination can be made. The island is a few feet above sea level and is not a reef. The nautical chart also indicates its location, so the accident was unexpected. The ship sank half an hour after hitting the island, and the current swept it to about 2 cables south of the island. The hull is completely submerged, with only the mast and chimney visible. (2) The Tong Shun rescued the survivors. The Tong Shun was carrying coal from Hongqi to Nanjing. At 10:00 a.m. on the 26th, while passing near Daji Mountain, it received telegrams from the Tongsha pilot boat and the patrol office. It immediately turned back to rescue the survivors. The Zhengji Company's Hui An also accompanied it. In the afternoon, it arrived at the scene of the accident and saw that the ship had sunk. The Tong Shun circled around Tripoint Island and N·W·Horn, sounding its whistle to indicate that a ship had come to help. At 4:00 p.m., someone was finally seen on the top of Liaochu Mountain waving clothes, indicating the location of the stranded crew members. However, it was already dark, and the evening wind was strong, so it was impossible to move forward. It anchored and waited. At dawn on the 27th, it lowered lifeboat No. 3 and sailed to the island. Fishermen rushed to tell them and guided them to the stranded crew members. A total of 20 people were rescued, including 3 who had died. Only 17 survivors were left. So, they shared life and death together, boarded the boat, and were transferred to the Tong Shun and returned to Shanghai. (3) The Hui An left. The captain and vice-captain of the Zhengji Company's Hui An were Japanese. When they sailed to the scene of the accident with the Tong Shun, they immediately turned around and sailed away upon seeing that the New Fu Tai had already sunk. They did not care about rescuing the survivors at all. (4) The captain was incompetent. The weather was clear when the ship hit the island. The accident was entirely due to the Russian captain's unfamiliarity with the route. The island is quite high above the water and can be seen from a distance. The so-called reef and fog are excuses to cover up the truth. (5) Post-accident policy. Finally, the executive committee of the association said that in previous years, accidents involving Chinese ships were caused by foreign crew members making unintentional mistakes, which could not be saved by human effort. However, Chinese shipowners worship foreigners. Although there are more and more Chinese crew members in recent years, and talents are emerging, they are still unwilling to hire them. The reason behind this is difficult to explain in a few words. However, not all foreign crew members are good materials. Recently, a certain ship sailing from Shanghai to Haizhou, with a Russian captain, spent three days and nights near Entering Gong Island and could not find the port of Haizhou. This is a big joke in the maritime world. However, this matter has not been exposed, so the Ministry of Communications and the Maritime Affairs Bureau have not thoroughly investigated it, and the shipowners have also not expressed their opinions. Therefore, unless the competent authorities take early action to eliminate the bad ones, and still allow shipowners to freely hire foreign crew members, future losses will be inevitable.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Expanding the Publicity for the Monthly Donation Campaign and the Charity Performance for Northeast Refugees <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Including the "Flower Queen Dance Election" Event</p>
<p>The charity performance for Northeast refugees, hosted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others, held at the New World, has been open for twelve days. In line with its purpose of promoting relief for the Northeast and advocating for the monthly donation campaign, new methods are being implemented from time to time. The following is a record of the latest news from last night:</p>
<p>Free Admission to the Exhibition Area for Promotional Materials: In order to concentrate the power of enthusiastic people from the middle class and below, the association has specially established a method for free admission to the exhibition area for promotional materials, in order to expand the monthly donation campaign and achieve practical results. The methods are as follows: ㈠ Dates: January 4th to January 8th, ㈡ Time: 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM daily, ㈢ Exhibits: (A) Painful paintings from the Art Academy, (B) Fragmented map of the Northeast, (C) Appeals from beyond the Great Wall on the wall, (D) Tragic scenes of the Jiangqiao battle, (E) Heartbreaking model of Zhabei, (F) Heroic plaster statues, (G) Feasible national salvation plan, (H) Relaxing exhibition of seasonal flowers, ㈣ Conditions: (A) Holders of bank monthly donation receipts of one jiao or more of silver dollars before December 31st, 1932 (upon arrival, Boy Scouts will exchange them for free admission tickets), (B) Those who voluntarily donate two jiao or more of silver dollars per month after New Year's Day of 1933 (those who pay will receive a receipt from the Boy Scouts), (C) Schools, labor unions, factories, and companies with 50 or more people must submit a formal letter to the association one day in advance to register and receive free admission forms, (D) Visitors must fill out a registration form, which can be clipped from advertisements in major newspapers today.</p>
<p>Additional Rules for the Flower Queen Dance Election: In addition to the dance stars and basic dance girls from major dance halls coming to the dance floor to provide voluntary dance partners every day, the association originally planned to have enthusiastic famous flowers accompany the dance on the four evenings of the 24th, 25th of this month, last night, and New Year's Day next year to serve the country. The dance tickets earned, with each ticket worth 1.5 yuan, will be included in the flower election calculation. Now, famous flowers who are enthusiastic about accompanying dances voluntarily give up their voting rights from dance tickets, so that famous flowers who are not familiar with dancing will not reduce their courage to compete as a result, so that adding one more vote to the election power means adding one more point to the national salvation strength. The association appreciates their enthusiasm and has specially formulated a method for the Flower Queen Dance Election. The simple rules are as follows: ㈡ The first place winner with the most voting rights from dance tickets by 2:00 AM on New Year's Day will be crowned the Flower Queen and presented with a large silver trophy. ㈡ The second place winner will be crowned the Flower Queen's East Palace and presented with a number two silver trophy. ㈢ The third place winner will be crowned the Flower Queen's Fourth Palace and presented with a number three silver trophy. ㈣ Those who obtain 2,500 or more dance ticket votes (i.e., 500 jiao) will all be crowned Flower Dance Stars and presented with a small silver trophy each. ㈤ Those who obtain 250 or more votes (i.e., 50 yuan) will each be presented with a commemorative certificate. ㈥ Flower Queen dance tickets are converted into votes, with each dance ticket worth one yuan counting as five votes.</p>
<p>Existing Results of the Flower Queen Dance Election: Looking at the results of the famous flowers participating in the Flower Queen Dance Election on the 24th and 25th, Xue Mei has 4,254 votes, Bing Xin has 3,923 votes, Ying Jiao has 3,372 votes, Lin Xiaoyun has 3,124 votes, and Ying Chun has 2,582 votes. All five of these individuals have exceeded the qualifications in Article 4. Xue You, Bing Hua, and Xue Fei all have more than 2,000 votes, while Qing Lou and Qin Fang all have more than 1,500 votes. It is unknown who will win the title of Flower Queen in the final calculation on New Year's Day night.</p>
<p>Special Programs After New Year's Day: The association's performance program was originally scheduled until New Year's Day, but it has now been extended to the 8th. It is reported that on the 1st and 2nd, the Dahua Film Company will perform all six episodes of "Tears and Smiles," completing one episode each night. Starting from January 3rd, male and female movie stars from all over Shanghai will participate in the performance, holding an unprecedented Movie Day.</p>

<h3 id="e145">A Country Girl from Huzhou Was Sold to Shanghai <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>After Explaining the Situation, the Employer Realized They Had Been Deceived and Sent the Country Girl to the Jiliang Institute</p>
<p>Chen Meizhen, a 17-year-old country girl from Xinshi Township, Huzhou, had beautiful features. Her parents died early, and she was poor and had no one to rely on. Through a matchmaker, she was betrothed to the surname Zhao family in the same village as a child bride. Her husband's name was Zhao Qian, and at the age of 21, he had not yet had a wedding ceremony, but his family was also not well-off, working hard every day. On the 11th day of the 11th lunar month, two people from the same village, named Ding Kui and A Xiang, who ran a small pharmacy, were local playboys. Seeing the girl's charming appearance, they lured her and brought her to Shanghai, colluding with a fugitive Tanglou woman, using the excuse of introducing her as a helper, and staying at Dai Hua's house, a Hangzhou woman who played cards at No. 6 Guangxi Road. Between the 26th of this month, she was sold to Wu Zhang, a Suzhou woman at No. 34 Yalu Road, as a niece-in-law, for a total of 180 yuan. Wu Zhang was very pleased with the girl's gentle and elegant demeanor and treated her very well, even changing her into new clothes. Although the girl was young, she knew the difference between right and wrong. She immediately stated to Wu Zhang that she was a married woman and had been deceived and abducted to Shanghai. Once discovered, it would definitely implicate her. Wu Zhang was greatly alarmed upon hearing this and immediately asked someone to deceive Hua and go to her residence to question her about the girl's origins. Hua did not know that she had been exposed by the girl and falsely claimed that Chen Meizhen was her daughter. Because her family was poor, she was willing to marry her niece as an adopted daughter, and nothing else would happen. She also rebuked the girl, saying, "You don't know what's good for you. You have plenty of food and clothing here, and you still want to go to heaven?" The girl angrily said that her parents had already passed away one after another, and that Hua was not her biological mother, so why would she say such a thing? They argued with each other, but Dai Hua was still not fully aware and comforted the girl slightly, saying, "You should stay here peacefully and not leave lightly." Wu Zhang also inquired about the truth from the girl and found out that only 80 yuan of the bride price had been paid, and the deception was not too deep. So, she reported it to the Hongkou Patrol Room a few days ago, and the detective, Sun Aizhong, and the patrolman, Li Zexing, secretly arrested Dai Hua and brought her to the patrol room. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court. The patrol room lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, explained the whole story and requested a postponement. Subsequently, the girl, Chen Meizhen, explained the whole process, while the employer, Wu Zhang, stated that her husband's name was Wen Guang, a Cantonese, and he was an accountant on a certain ship. She had a nephew who was just over twenty years old and eager to marry. She wanted to find a wife and was entrusting someone to do so. At that time, her husband's friend, Wu Shilian, and the Cantonese woman, Chen Bagu, acted as matchmakers and told the defendant that they would marry her daughter to her nephew as a child bride for a bride price of 180 yuan. She would temporarily join the family as a child bride. Who knew that she was an abducted girl? Fortunately, Chen Meizhen told her the truth, otherwise, she would have been implicated endlessly. Now, she has only been deceived out of a bride price of 80 yuan. Wu Xuelian and Chen Bagu testified that they did not know the defendant and that this girl's origins were the doing of the fugitive dwarf woman and the defendant. They did not know the details. When questioned, the defendant stammered and said that the silver dollars had been taken away by the dwarf woman, requesting judgment. Judge Shen Bingrong examined the confessions and ordered that she be remanded in custody, rescheduled for investigation and further questioning. The girl, Chen Meizhen, was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.</p>

Due to the heavy workload, the original lawyers were not enough to allocate, so the Director General appointed Zhang Shizhu as a lawyer in the department to assist in legal matters.

<h3 id="e155">Record of the Interrogation of Liu Chongwu and Others from the Blood Vengeance Anti-Treason Group <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Six Individuals Including Tang Shoukang Acquitted and Released</p>
<p>Liu Chongwu and Others Face Four Charges</p>
<p>The Court Examines Each Case Separately to Avoid Confusion</p>
<p>The Interrogation Continued Until Noon Yesterday Without Completion</p>
<p>Liu Chongwu and others, members of the Blood Vengeance Anti-Treason Group specializing in targeting smugglers and treacherous merchants, were arrested by Deputy Detective Zhao Bingkun of the Public Concession Police Department for repeatedly throwing bombs, opening fire, and injuring treacherous merchants and their employees. After thorough investigation, those with solid evidence were prosecuted in the First Special District Court, while those with slight suspicion were released on bail pending further investigation. Details have been previously reported. Yesterday morning was the scheduled hearing. The police sent the eight detainees, including Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, Zhang Linxiang, Fan Xisheng, Zhu Erkang, and Hua Zhida, along with five confiscated pistols and dozens of bullets, to the Second Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Tang Chou Kang, Wu Ligang, Xu Weizu, and the woman Pan Huizhu, who had been released on bail, and witnesses were also summoned to court. Defense lawyers Chen Tingrui, Xue Jiaqi, and Ruan Dingkui, and prosecuting lawyer Wang Yaotang from the police department, also appeared in court. At 11:00 AM, Judge Qian Wenji began the investigation. By 12:15 PM, it was not even halfway through, so it was postponed. The details of the interrogation are as follows:</p>
<p>Six Individuals Acquitted and Released　Tang Chou Kang, Wu Ligang, Xu Weizu, Pan Huizhu, and the detained Zhang Linxiang and Fan Xisheng, a total of six men and women, were found by the police to have no connection to the cases committed by the Anti-Treason Group. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that Tang and others had been wrongly accused, and since no evidence had been found, he requested that the six be acquitted and released first. Judge Qian approved the request, declared Tang and others not guilty, and released them in court. However, Pan Huizhu was instructed to remain in the courtroom in case her brother Pan Hongsheng's case required questioning.</p>
<p>First Examining Illegal Possession of Military Weapons　After Tang and others were released, only six defendants remained: Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, Zhu Erkang, and Hua Zhida. These six were charged with multiple counts, including conspiracy to murder, attempted murder, intimidation, and illegal possession of military weapons. The police lawyer proposed examining each case separately to avoid confusion and facilitate clarity. With the court's permission, the lawyer requested that the case of the defendants violating the regulations on banning military firearms be examined first, and described the circumstances of confiscating the pistols and bullets. Subsequently, Pannas, a Western official from the Public Works Department, detailed his examination of the pistols, bullets, and shell casings, stating that four of the five pistols had been used. He testified that the shell casings obtained in the Xinza Road and Hankou Road cases confirmed that they were fired from these four guns. He presented multiple photos of the guns and bullets along with the bullets themselves. Ge Leiboshi, the Western detective in charge of the case, reported the circumstances of finding the guns and bullets on or near the defendants. Liu Chongwu confessed that the pistol was given to him by Pan Hongsheng, while Pan Hongsheng and Cao Songshou both confessed that the pistols were issued by a fugitive named Gao. The other three, Tian, Zhu, and Hua, claimed that they did not carry pistols and did not know where they came from.</p>
<p>The Maotai Company Injury Case　Maotai Foreign Goods Store at 310 and 312 Xinza Road was bombed on November 18th, with the bombs failing to explode. Subsequently, shots were fired in the store, resulting in the death of manager Wang Jintang. The police investigation revealed that Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, Tian Shuiyang, and the fugitives Gao and Zhu were responsible. Therefore, Liu, Pan, Cao, and Tian were prosecuted for premeditated murder. According to the police lawyer, the defendants believed that Maotai Foreign Goods Store was illegally selling Japanese goods. On November 16th, they gathered at the Xinza Road Great King Temple to discuss countermeasures. Apart from Liu Chongwu, Pan, Cao, Tian, and the fugitives Gao and Zhu participated in the meeting. After the decision was made, Gao issued pistols to Pan and Cao, while Liu Chongwu and Zhu each carried a bomb. They set off from the Great King Temple to Maotai Store. Although Tian Shuiyang was unarmed, he was responsible for keeping watch. Upon arriving at Maotai's entrance, they found the store unloading goods, making it difficult to act. After the unloading, the defendants entered the store, and Liu threw the bomb, which did not explode. Cao Songshou and Zhu each fired a shot, wounding Wang Jintang. Although Pan Hongsheng also had a gun, he did not fire because he was keeping watch outside the store. The four defendants have confessed to this case at the police station, and Chinese and Western detectives took the four to Maotai to demonstrate the circumstances of the bombing and shooting. The evidence in this case is solid and complete, and they should be severely punished according to the law, the lawyer said. The Western deputy detective reported on the investigation process and presented two diaries found on Pan and Cao, as well as a photograph of them with Yun Enfang and Cai Yaozu. The lawyer stated that the diaries contained descriptions of the Maotai and other cases, as well as detailed addresses, contact information, and phone numbers of their accomplices. Ge Yongzhang, a partner at Maotai, testified that he was hiding in a corner due to extreme fear during the shooting and did not see the faces of the shooters. He stated that he witnessed the defendants signing their confessions at the police station. Liu Chongwu testified that he carried a bomb wrapped in newspaper outside the store. Cao Songshou and Gao entered the store pretending to buy cloth, and then he saw them exit. He threw the bomb in, but it did not explode because the safety mechanism was not activated. Cao Songshou testified that he fired a shot at the ground. Pan Hongsheng testified that they had repeatedly warned the store for selling enemy goods, but they did not repent. Their purpose was not to kill anyone. Tian Shuiyang testified that the action was decided on the spot and not pre-planned. At this point, lawyer Chen Tingrui and the police lawyer had some debate over the questions. Pan Hongsheng and Cao Songshou continued to testify that their purpose was purely to warn the treacherous merchants. They stated that treacherous merchants often hired red-shirted thugs to escort large quantities of Japanese goods during import, and if they interfered, they would be arrested and beaten by the red-shirt team. Therefore, they carried pistols for self-defense. At this point, all witnesses in the case had testified.</p>
<p>The Yuyuan Heng Injury Case　The police lawyer then presented the investigation into the Yuyuan Heng case, stating that the store was located at 339 Hankou Road. At 2:00 PM on November 24th, Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Cao Songshou, and the fugitives Gao and Zhu went to the store and threw a bomb, injuring Wang, a store employee, who later died from his injuries, and another employee, who was still being treated in the hospital. The defendants had previously met at 263 Tianlu Road. Their original intention was to kill the store owner, Shen. Gao provided the pistols and bombs. Liu and Cao each held a pistol, while Pan and Shang each held a bomb. Therefore, Liu, Pan, and Cao were prosecuted for premeditated murder. Xu Genrong, a staff member of the store, testified that he heard a sudden noise and immediately fled, so he did not see who threw the bomb. Upon hearing this, Liu Chongwu claimed that Xu's statement was false. He stated that he entered the store first with the bomb and met Xu. He told Xu that the Northeast had fallen, and the volunteer army was fighting the Japanese invaders despite hunger and cold. He said that as merchants with conscience, they should completely awaken and stop selling enemy goods. If they only cared about personal interests, they were helping the tiger to hurt people. He said that instead of heeding the advice, Xu ordered the old bookkeeper standing aside to seize him. The bookkeeper bumped into the bomb he was holding, and the bomb fell to the ground. He then left the store, so he did not know if anyone was injured. Cao Songshou testified that he was in the alley and his pistol did not fire. It was an accidental discharge. Pan Hongsheng testified that he heard the gunshot, placed the bomb on the ground, and left.</p>
<p>The Sun Guangxing Bombing Case　The Sun Guangxing Clock Store at 133 Henan Road was bombed on October 24th by Pan Hongsheng and Cao Songshou, who also left a letter. The bomb exploded, injuring Xie, a Shaoxing man who was in the store to do business, in the back. He has now been treated at the hospital and was summoned to testify. The police lawyer stated the circumstances of the case and requested that Pan and Cao be punished for premeditated murder. Xie testified that the bomber was wearing green clothes and looked like Cao Songshou. Cao admitted it without hesitation, stating that the bomb and letter were given to him by someone named He. Pan claimed that he went along but was unarmed. It was already past noon, so Judge Qian adjourned the hearing to 1:00 PM on January 5th. The detectives took the defendants back to the police station for detention.</p>

<p>Wen Xuancheng, a native of Zhenjiang and the director of the Shanghai Middle School Association, lived at 2 Xiexing Lane, Haichao Road, in the city. His seven-year-old son, Guohua, was suddenly kidnapped outside his door on the 7th of last month, and a huge ransom was demanded. Later, Chief Detective You A'gen, Detective Liu Junqing, and Detectives Li Shugui and Pang Yutang of the Public Concession Police Station arrested twelve kidnappers, including Shen Wengao, Wan Shihhao, Yin Yucen, Lu Rongchang, Zhang Jun, Zhang Zhongshan, Zhu Xiaoguan, Wang Hongju, Guo Xibin, Xu Shengpu, Ding Guangzheng, and Wang Xijin. They confiscated one pistol and five bullets and rescued Wen Guohua at 110 Dixiwei Road. It was discovered that Shen Wengao and others had also committed the attempted kidnapping of Lu Ziqing, a comprador of Huada Foreign Firm, the shooting death of Lu, and four or five other major cases of kidnapping and robbery. After the First Special Court completed the interrogation, Chief Judge Ma Shide of the Criminal Court announced the verdict in Criminal Court One yesterday morning. Shen Wengao, Wan Shihhao, Yin Yucen, and Zhang Zhongshan were all sentenced to death. Zhang Jun, Xu Shengpu, and Wang Xijin were all sentenced to life imprisonment. Zhu Xiaoguan was sentenced to twelve years in prison. Lu Rongtang and Ding Guangzheng were each sentenced to eight years in prison. Wang Hongju and Guo Xishi were each sentenced to six years in prison. One pistol and five bullets were confiscated. After the sentencing, police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that defendant Lu Rongtang had been sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 600 yuan by the court on June 2, 1919, for counterfeiting currency. Lu was released on bail of 1,000 yuan pending appeal, but Lu repeatedly failed to appear in court, and the Second Branch Court issued an arrest warrant. Now that he has been apprehended, how should it be handled? Please also make a ruling. Judge Feng then instructed Lu Rongtang to be sent to the Second Branch Court for review.</p>

<p>Kidnappers Dare to Demand Ransom Again, Sentenced to Five Years in Prison After Arrest</p>
<p>Zhong Xi'an, residing at 75 Xiangkang Lane, Baker Road, is a Christian and currently serves as a pastor. On the 20th of last month, he went to Hangzhou for church affairs and was kidnapped by bandits at the Hangzhou Railway Station. However, an hour later, he managed to escape from the bandits' den. The bandits, having gained and then lost their wealth, were unwilling to give up and sent a letter to Zhong Zisheng, demanding 2,000 yuan in harsh terms. Zisheng reported the letter to the General Patrol Room of the General Police Department for investigation. They agreed with the bandits on a meeting location and time. The day before yesterday, Chief Detective Zhen Liancha and Detective Feng Shouming went to Daqing Lane on Nanjing Road and Xizang Road as agreed. The bandit, Wang Wenqi, a native of Shaoxing, also arrived, intending to negotiate. He was immediately arrested. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu investigated and confirmed the facts. He was sentenced to five years in prison in court.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Charity Lottery Tickets in Greater Demand Than Supply <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The sales of charity lottery tickets have been reported in previous issues. It is reported that due to the urgent time frame, there was not enough time to print all the tickets. Yesterday, only over 80,000 tickets were issued, and the remaining small portion will be printed in the next few days. As a result, sales outlets continue to request more tickets, but they cannot be fully supplied. There is a situation where demand exceeds supply. In addition to directly purchasing from the Race Club and various sales outlets, some foreigners, such as a member of the Foreign Stock Exchange and a member of the International Savings Society, have also obtained large quantities of lottery tickets from the Finance Bureau and are actively promoting sales. This demonstrates that people from both China and abroad are enthusiastic about supporting charitable causes.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news about the missing Yuqing freighter in today's local news column of your esteemed newspaper, the facts are slightly inaccurate. The Yuqing freighter, represented by our company, sailed from Fuzhou to Zhenji, a place under the jurisdiction of Fu'an, to load coal for Ningbo. However, since the ship sailed out, there has been no news until the 26th. We have been searching in all directions recently, but there is still no reliable news. The gross tonnage of the ship is 3,500 tons, and the net tonnage is 2,700 tons. The amount of coal loaded last time has not yet been determined. The 2,700 tons of coal mentioned in your newspaper is probably a rumor. This letter is to correct the record. Please publish this letter in your esteemed newspaper. Sincerely, Tongyu Shipping Company, Chen Yisheng.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Poor Family and Heavy Burden | Letter from Ms. Zhao Jinglan <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Sir, I am a woman who married in her teens. At that time, my husband's family consisted of only the two of us, my husband's parents, and one servant. The family has been scholars for generations. Although it is an old-fashioned family, they are very harmonious. My husband is an old man's only son, and his parents naturally love and cherish him and do not want him to attend school. However, he studied in a private school, and it is a pity that he was born late and could not catch up with the imperial examination era for development. Because the family has been scholars for generations, they are unwilling to let him work in the business world. After getting married, he taught Chinese in the local area. Fortunately, in the early years of the Republic of China, the cost of living was not high, and the population was small. The ancestors left a hundred or two acres of land and a little income from teaching, which was enough to make ends meet. However, in the past one or two decades, the situation has changed greatly. I have now given birth to nine children, sons and daughters. The older ones are already studying in high school and junior high school, and the younger ones are studying in elementary school. The youngest is still nursing. Therefore, clothing, food, housing, and education expenses have increased two or three times compared to before. How can we afford it? Prices of everything are gradually increasing, and the family's farmland often suffers from famine. The income from teaching has also decreased compared to before because people are more enlightened and the older students all go to school and are unwilling to study in private schools. Due to these factors, the income has not been enough to cover expenses in the past ten years, and the deficit has gradually increased. Last year, my parents-in-law unfortunately passed away. After all the funeral arrangements were completed, we were heavily in debt and could not afford to pay it back. At this point, after comprehensive consideration, we had no choice but to sell our property to repay the debt. Initially, we thought that after selling the property, we would still have two or three thousand yuan left to start a small business to make a living. However, because of the high grain tax, low land prices, land surveys, and other reasons, people with money are unwilling to buy land. Land prices have plummeted. After selling the property and paying off the debt, we were left with nothing. Now we have no roof over our heads and no place to stand. We still have to eat, wear clothes, live in a house, and go to school. We have no income. My husband earns only a hundred or so yuan from teaching, and I help by doing handicrafts, which is not enough to support the family. Therefore, my husband is actively trying to find a job, but he has no academic background or scientific knowledge. There are many normal school graduates looking forward to becoming elementary school teachers, so there is no room for us to squeeze in. If we go into politics, we have no connections. If we go into business, we are outsiders. Therefore, we have nowhere to turn. As for myself, although I attended elementary school, I did not graduate. Now I am no longer suitable. Handicrafts are my forte, but I do not have the strength to do those rough jobs. I have no knowledge of science and can only recognize a few Chinese characters and calculate a few things. Where can such a person find a job? In short, my husband and I are well-trained in diligence, thrift, honesty, and resourcefulness. In addition, under such difficult circumstances, as long as we do not disgrace our ancestors, maintain our integrity, and protect our children's dignity, we can do any hardship and go any distance. However, even with this firm and enduring aspiration, we still cannot find a job. Sir, what do you think is the best thing to do? Food, clothing, and shelter are indispensable, and education expenses are also essential. My children are very diligent and hardworking. The middle school they attend is the famous Yangzhou Provincial Middle School, and the elementary school they attend is also well-known. Usually, the brothers and sisters study hard together, and none of them fail. Their conduct in school is also good. If we give up education expenses and let them drop out of school, they will give up halfway and cannot become successful. Wouldn't that be heartbreaking? Moreover, even if we save on education expenses, we still have no money for food and clothing. In total, the annual expenses, which cannot be reduced any further, for food, clothing, shelter, and education must be about a thousand yuan, but we have no income and no way to find a job. Isn't it like waiting to die, trapped alive? Sir, you are talented and knowledgeable. I am not afraid of bothering you and have written this long letter detailing my family's situation to ask for your guidance and leadership to lead my family to a bright and happy path to overcome the current difficulties. That would be truly grateful.</p>
<p>Reply: We read your letter in one breath and were truly moved by your plight. The facts are very clear. In your letter, we can clearly see how China's agricultural economy and society are gradually declining. At the same time, it clearly tells us how the general petty bourgeoisie is collapsing rapidly, quickly becoming nakedly poor, and they are still struggling, shouting, looking around blankly, and seeing no way out. This is not the misfortune of Ms. Zhao alone, but indeed a general symptom of the society before us. This is not a simple letter, but a true portrayal of the collapse and decline of the middle class. Since Ms. Zhao's experience is general, and Ms. Zhao asks us to solve this difficulty, the fundamental solution must start from the "general." However, what Ms. Zhao is asking for is a specific solution to the current situation. Regarding this, we can only ask you and your husband to be patient and cope with it for the time being. An annual household expense of about a thousand yuan seems to be able to be reduced a bit. After the eldest son finishes middle school, he does not need to go to college and can find a job. In fact, in this society, studying does not necessarily make you useful. On the other hand, your husband should also think of finding a job. Although it is said that there is a surplus of labor now and it is difficult to find a job, we can only ask your husband to be accommodating and put down the airs of the petty bourgeoisie. As long as you are attentive to some small jobs, you will eventually find one sooner or later. Naturally, this is only a temporary solution. The fundamental cure should start from the root. Only by solving the "whole" can we solve the "part." Ms. Zhao should recognize this, and we hope that your children will also recognize it.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Important News: Jiangsu Education Funds Released for Half a Month <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The September Payment Notice Has Been Signed and Can Be Issued Soon. Due to the Provincial Department of Finance's arrears of nearly 3 million yuan in allocations to various counties and provincial subsidies, the provincial education funds have been delayed for years. After representatives from provincial schools and teachers associations went to Nanjing in the middle of this month to continue to petition, the Education Fund Management Office has issued payment notices for the second half of August. After the payment notices were issued, the funds could not be immediately collected in cash due to insufficient funds in the treasury. Director Niu of the Education Fund Management Office, because various schools are in urgent need, in addition to sending section chiefs to various counties to urge for the funds, also borrowed 20,000 yuan from the Wuxi Shanghai Bank and 40,000 yuan from other sources on the 26th to issue the second half of August expenses to the schools. After the funds were raised, various schools can now collect the cash. The September payment notices were signed by the audit committee on the 25th and will be issued after being stamped by the Department of Education and signed by the Director of the Management Office. The payment notice is dated January 10 and is used to withdraw funds from the bank when due. However, it is heard that after the Management Office recently issued the second half of August expenses, the treasury is empty. Section Chief Liu is now urging the borrowing of funds from various counties, and it is heard that Section Chief Yang will also go to various counties soon to urge the funds, hoping to raise 120,000 yuan by January 10 to issue the September expenses to provincial schools and social education institutions.</p>

<p>(1) Reading</p>
<p>㈠ Close Reading of Selected Texts: In the first academic year, the teaching of the system should pay attention to its characteristics and writing methods. In the second academic year, the teaching of representative works of each era should pay attention to its school and evolution. In the third academic year, the teaching of academic thought texts should pay attention to its historical background and influence. (2) Focus Reading of Selected Books: Select the special books for close reading, briefly explain its historical status, literary value, author's era background, and personal style, etc., collectively or individually, and instruct reading methods, points, time, and reference books, and cultivate students' ability to use reference books and reference materials at any time.</p>

<p>(2) Composition</p>
<p>㈠ Writing Techniques</p>
<p>1. Grammar should continue to pay attention to the similarities and differences between vernacular and classical Chinese. The special features of grammar in ancient books should also be explained separately to help students understand ancient books.</p>
<p>2. Rhetoric should focus on the organization and system of articles, the method of diction, and the types of rhetoric. Attention should also be paid to the appreciation of literary works and the discrimination of writers' styles to cultivate talent and the ability to appreciate famous works of Chinese literature.</p>

<h3 id="e175">A Respectful Appeal to College and University Students Nationwide to Implement Education to Save the Nation (You Huai Gao) <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>(9) The only way to save the nation is "Educational Service." I do not hope that college and university students across the country will immediately go to the countryside to implement it, but I hope that within three months, in major events and secondary schools across the country, united people can quickly establish the National Education Salvation Association. After the organization is complete, then unite the educational salvation associations in various places to form the National Education Salvation Association to ask the government to issue an order, with the following intentions:</p>
<p>"All college and university students nationwide must, after graduation, abide by the National Education Salvation Association's charter and, under the guidance of the National Education Salvation Association, go to various villages to perform educational service for one year. College and university students who have not performed educational service for more than one year will ㈠ not be given a diploma, ㈡ not be allowed to take up employment, ㈢ not be allowed to marry, ㈣ not be allowed to inherit property."</p>
<p>Students who are unwilling to provide education to others during this time of national crisis are showing that they cannot fulfill their duties and lack empathy. Therefore, they are considered to be people without civic virtue and should be abandoned by the people. However, after students have completed their educational service, the government should hold a grand adult ceremony every year. The Chairman of the Chinese Government and the Chairmen of each province should personally award educational service certificates to confirm that they are a supreme honor for the people.</p>
<p>Since students have fulfilled their responsibility of contributing their talents, the bourgeoisie must also fulfill their responsibility of contributing their wealth. Then, the government should issue an order, with the following main points:</p>
<p>"All citizens of the Republic of China who enjoy property rights should collect a few percent of the national tax as an education salvation tax to fund the national education salvation. The economic management association should be organized by each province or county to be responsible for the custody and distribution of funds. The charter will be formulated by the National Education Salvation Association. If any citizen can automatically donate education salvation funds, the government should reward them according to their merits."</p>
<p>Currently, there are people who can provide education and there are funds, but to educate 300 million people and spread it across 4 million square kilometers of land is an unprecedented event in Chinese history. Therefore, it is necessary to gather specialized talents from across the country in the capital and various provincial and municipal areas to organize the National Education Salvation Association to design, guide, and operate this great undertaking of education to save the nation. The government should then issue an order, with the following main points:</p>
<p>"All higher specialized talents among the citizens of the Republic of China should gather within one month in the capital or the metropolises of various provincial and municipal areas to organize the National Education Salvation Association and its various provincial and municipal branches to design, guide, and promote rural education affairs across the country, and organize various statistical bureaus for national social people's livelihood resources, and can freely use the Central Radio Station to broadcast nationwide. All expenses will be provided by the government, but members are all honorary positions."</p>
<p>Six. Applied documents. All declarations, contracts, regulations, advertisements, and other official documents can be made by students.</p>
<p>Seven. Literary works. All novels, poems, plays, and dramas can be made by students.</p>

<p>Today's Stott Cup Semi-Finals, Jinan vs. Lancashire</p>
<p>At 2:40 PM at Yiyuan</p>
<p>In one scene of the Stott Cup semi-finals, Jinan will face Lancashire at Yiyuan at 2:40 PM this afternoon. If it is a tie, the time must be extended. Lancashire's strength is not weak, and Jinan has a wealth of talent and strong combat power. Judging from past results, Jinan seems to be able to secure a victory, but Chen Zhenhe and Luo Haiguang of Jinan cannot play, and their strength is inevitably slightly reduced. Therefore, it is still difficult to predict the outcome of this battle, and there will be fierce fighting to determine the finals qualification.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening, three wins to one against Haixing. Tonight, all ball games are temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>The New World Northeast Refugee Relief Variety Show held the women's volleyball finals last night. Nine Stars defeated Haixing three to one, taking the lead. Haixing is the crystallization of the essence of each team. Its defeat can be attributed to the loss of momentum in the third game. If they can work hard in time, there will be a more intense performance. It's not just the result of one to three. The Nine Stars are a variant of the Wuben team. When they are united and striving, coupled with the pure skills of cooperation, the victory is not a fluke. In the first game, there were not many highlights from both sides. The Nine Stars won 21 to 13 due to being more cooperative and calm. In the second game, Haixing's Guan Liuzhu and Wang Chunru performed amazingly, and then took back a game with 21 to 19. The score became even at one to one. The situation became very tense. At the beginning of the back-and-forth, the Nine Stars had a slight advantage. Later, because Zhang Biru in the first row had powerful spikes and the third row resisted effectively, they finally won the third game with 21 to 19 in the close score. In the fourth game, Nine Stars was bold and Haixing was weak. Nine Stars won the championship again with 21 to 16.</p>
<p>Nine Stars: Zhang Biru, Xue Zhijie, Zhang Jiasui, Zhang Yun, Qian Yi, Wang Jinfeng, Wang Fengying, Lu Meiyun, Xiao Jieying</p>

<p>Guanghua defeats Shangzhong: Promote Teacher Sports. The Guanghua Middle School faculty basketball team, in order to connect feelings and improve skills, specially invited the Shanghai Middle School faculty team yesterday for a friendly match at the school's court. Twenty players from Shangzhong arrived at Guanghua at 4:30 PM. After a short rest, they began the competition. Shangzhong Principal Zheng Tongzhi and Junior High School Director Tian Ding also personally took the field to show their skills. Mr. Zheng's basketball skills are quite good and he scored two points. Guanghua Director Liao Maoru did not attend due to other matters, otherwise the interest would have been even stronger. The purpose of this competition is to promote teacher sports. Both sides take victory and defeat lightly. In the competition, Shangzhong's lineup was sometimes good and sometimes bad because the main player Yao Liang was absent and each player had to play for ten minutes. It was not as consistent as Guanghua. As a result, Guanghua defeated Shangzhong 29 to 19. It is heard that Shangzhong will invite the Guanghua team to the school's court for a second friendly match in the New Year.</p>

<p>Life is like a stream of flowing water, often stirring up waves. My life is short, but there are still some things that often make me painfully recall.</p>
<p>When I was just able to remember, I often heard my great-grandmother say while I sat on her lap: "You will definitely be a good child in the future. On the night you were born, your grandfather dreamed of the largest tree in the countryside catching fire, and your mother dreamed of a rural teacher coming to her house and refusing to leave. When they woke up from their dreams, you were crying in the world."</p>
<p>It seems strange, but I was already a teacher in my twenty-second year.</p>
<p>But with my birth, unfortunate things continued to happen.</p>
<p>One of my aunts repeatedly told me:</p>
<p>"When you grow up in the future, you should repay me well. Without me, you wouldn't be alive now. Your mother liked to gamble the most, often gambling until dawn, and your father often didn't come home at night. When you woke up late at night, you would cry. Your temper was bad since you were a child, and your crying was so urgent. When your mother heard your crying, she put down her cards and returned to her own room, starting to hold you and coax you to sleep. But she could rarely trick you. As soon as she put you down, you would cry loudly again. Your mother was thinking about cards, but she couldn't put you down, so she got angry and threw you on the ground. Several times, when I ran to your mother's room to see, you were already lying on the ground, cold, and had been dead for a long time."</p>
<p>But the most unfortunate thing is that I completely inherited my mother's irritable personality.</p>
<p>Since the day I entered elementary school, I was expelled from school two or three times every year, and it was always because of quarrels with classmates. The students in the same class had to be subject to my control. If they refused to obey me, I would overcome them with force. After school at three or four o'clock in the afternoon, it was time for me to use force: leading a group of classmates under my command, lying in ambush at the crossroads, waiting for the rebel, catching him and beating him until he knelt on the ground begging for mercy before letting him go. In the end, the students in the same school were no longer in my eyes, and I moved the target to the neighboring elementary school. I can't describe the situation of that kind of fighting with my pen, but whenever I think of that time, I immediately think of the scene of the two clans killing each other in Romeo and Juliet. The most regrettable thing is that neither side had weapons. Such a rebellious elementary school student entered the strictest middle school.</p>
<p>Expulsion was still a common thing, but not because of quarrels with classmates, but because it was related to the teachers. I still clearly remember our middle school's thin-faced, bald-headed, round-nosed, rat-eyed dean of discipline. He didn't talk about justice much, and always favored the teachers. Whenever I was summoned to the discipline office from the classroom, when he showed his power, I would reason with him. If he didn't reason with me, I would no longer reason with him, and let him do whatever he wanted. His punishment was always severe, but I had classmates as my backing, and I would ask the school authorities in the name of the whole class, because each incident was not entirely about me personally, but was often instigated by many classmates.</p>
<p>Times have changed. Those unreasonable teachers and deans may have been replaced by new enlightened people. Until now, I still feel that none of the conflicts I had with the teachers in middle school should be blamed on me.</p>
<p>Between my time from elementary school to middle school and leaving middle school, our family encountered several storms.</p>
<p>My father was in the banking industry, specializing in buying and selling stocks. He was very lucky at first and created a small bourgeois family. But in the year I graduated from elementary school, my father's speculation failed, and our family encountered bankruptcy for the first time.</p>
<h3 id="e196">On Food, Sex, and Desire <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>"Food and sex are human nature." This is absolutely true. "Behind the red gates, meat and wine rot, while the fields are full of skeletons of the starved dead," so there must be class struggle. On one side, "The harem beauties number three thousand," "Each day the monarch cannot see enough," while on the other, "In Stone Moat Village, husband and wife bid farewell," "Husband guards the Xiao Pass, while his wife is in Wu," so there must be revolution. However, the desires for food and sex, because they are basic desires, are very easy to satisfy. No matter how great an epicure you are, as long as you have a jug of wine, a chicken, three bowls of white rice, and a big pancake, you can always be defeated. After eating your fill, even if He Zeng invites you as a guest, you can no longer eat it. As for sex, I think no matter how energetic you are, ten women at most will be enough to deal with. After experiencing ten women, even Xi Shi and Tai Zhen can no longer arouse sexual desire. Therefore, primitive basic desires are easy to fulfill; the most difficult thing to deal with is that abstract desire that goes beyond what is necessary, endlessly, and even becomes a morbid obsession. Philosophers call it desire, and the desire mentioned in the old Chinese essays is this thing.</p>
<p>According to Western philosophers, this desire is the driving force of evolution. Because of desire, everyone goes to work, invent, save... and then there is society, evolution, civilization... This is also true, of course, from the good aspects of desire. But in China, the good aspects of this desire are not developed, and what is making great progress is precisely the bad aspects of things that are spurred by this desire. Because of desire, Chinese people want to scrape the land, sell official titles, compete for territory... ×××, in the end, they forget the purpose completely, and even recognize the means as the end. The miser in The Scholars, who refused to breathe his last when he was dying, only begrudging the two wicks in the oil lamp, is not an imagination, but a common thing in Chinese society. Precisely because of this, Lao Tzu wants to persuade people to be content, Buddhists want to talk bitterly about Nirvana, Schopenhauer wants to extinguish will, and Russell says that all useless desires should be suppressed, and the creation of desires must be increased, which is the fundamental law to eliminate war. The teachings of the wise are indeed correct, but unfortunately China has evolved too early.</p>
<p>Before the European Industrial Revolution, China, thousands of years ago, was full of these great teachings of contentment and inaction, so in an era when the growth of desire should be encouraged and the progress of material things should be promoted, China fell into a state of ease and freedom. By the nineteenth century, when the splendor and wealth of Western material civilization flowed into China, the Chinese, who had long suffered from the dryness and loneliness of inaction and contentment, jumped from one extreme to the other. As a result, the situation is getting worse and worse, and the floods are raging. We Chinese have become a nation that lets them (Westerners) create, and we will enjoy it. While Spengler is worrying about the year of the decline of Western culture, Chinese dignitaries happen to be wearing silk socks costing forty taels of silver a pair and opening bottles of champagne costing fifty taels of silver a bottle. With a thunderous sound, the armies of Japan and other imperialists marched into China majestically. The poor old people not only had no food and sex, but could not even keep their lives. Patriotic people began to discuss the reasons why they were strong and we were weak. So the conservatives said that material civilization harmed China, and the progressives said that the pioneers, the sages and wise men were the culprits who caused the weakness of modern China. Both sides have their reasons, but it seems that neither side has said it all correctly.</p>
<p>In short, the first is the question of 'timing': China became too backward because it evolved too early, and in the era when material civilization should have been promoted, only ghost-like spiritual civilization was promoted. The second is the question of 'selection': Western material civilization eroded the East at the same time, but Japan took the good aspects of it, while China only took the bad aspects of it. For example, if it is a walnut, the Japanese take its meat, while the Chinese only take its shell.</p>
<p>What is the crime of material civilization? What is the crime of desire?</p>
<h3 id="e197">George Bernard Shaw and the Actress's Love Affair <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>Recently, there is a collection of letters, Ellen Terry and Bernard Shaw, published, with more than 400 pages, recording the love letters between these two people. Terry was a famous actress. At the time of the correspondence, she was already fifty years old, but she was still Ellen Terry, and many people admired her. George Bernard Shaw praised her art: "Dear Ellen, undoubtedly, you must be deified before you can perform in a drama. Once you enter the realm of deification, you will fear nothing."</p>
<p>Shaw boasted that he was a descendant of Irish nobles. He was eight years younger than Ellen.</p>
<p>Their love affair was somewhat different. Ellen was a woman without great ambitions. She was just an actress who reached the peak of her career. Because her nature was close to that of an actress, her fame was accidental, not "achieved by force." George Bernard Shaw, however, was a man with great ambitions. He wrote dramas not only for the sake of drama, but for everything he did was purposeful. In his love letters, he still did not forget his great career, so the lover George Bernard Shaw was entangled with the playwright George Bernard Shaw. He himself once said in a love letter to Ellen: "I love women, but I also sincerely like other things. Most women take a man and a lifetime as the whole world; but I need to have relations with ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. I want to make the writing machine accelerate. Love is just my entertainment and rest."</p>
<p>When this letter began, Shaw was writing theater reviews for the Saturday Review. Terry was the protagonist of the Lyceum Theatre.</p>
<p>This letter is not a letter from a monk and a nun. Of course, it will not be very disciplined, but it was not until the end of this book that they had a taste of flesh! Sincere and strong. Ellen besieged him. He had to write to her several times a day and write very long letters. Shaw also besieged Ellen. Ellen wrote him just as many letters, but not as long as his. Shaw wrote beautifully and romantically. Even on the train, which was shaking very badly, he was still fascinated by the "beautiful countryside and ghostly moonlight" and wrote many affectionate words. One night he went to Dorking and wrote to Ellen: "I am now very attached to you. I am restless. A man's restlessness is always for a woman, and my restlessness is for Terry."</p>
<p>I don't know if it was for revenge or for other reasons, Shaw married Charlotte Frances Payne Townshend in 1898. He wrote to Ellen calling Payne a "woman with light green eyes and millions of dollars." He also said that his love with her was just to change to something fresh. Later, he said that he "likes her very much, but loving her is too much." Ellen also scolded Payne in her letters. These letters have been destroyed by Ellen, so there is a part missing from this collection of letters. After the marriage, Shaw was still as affectionate to Ellen as before, but Ellen had greatly changed her attitude.</p>
<p>Until 1925, they continued to correspond, but the fire of passion had long been extinguished, and the flames had long been dimmed.</p>
<h3 id="e198">A Proposal <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Yang</p>
<p>I would now like to make a proposal in front of the people of the whole country, namely: "Change the Yue Wu Mu Temple on the West Lake to "Qin Hui Temple", pull down the statues of Yue Fei and his son, and replace them with bronze statues of Qin Hui and his wife. Mouye Mouye, and Mr. Hu Shi, etc. are entitled to be enshrined in the two wings. Qin Hui and his wife have their original positions. (The gate of Yue Temple) Replace the iron statues of Yue Fei and his son." The reasons are as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ During the Song Dynasty, Yue Fei advocated war, and Qin Hui advocated peace. Now it is Yue Fei who advocates peace, and Qin Hui who advocates war. Since the facts have been reversed, the way of rewarding good and punishing evil must also be changed. The praise and derogation in the Spring and Autumn Annals is almost more glorious than the Huakun and more fearsome than the axe.</p>
<p>㈡ Mr. Hu Shi recently discovered (according to what he told his friends) that according to the Song History, the environment in which the Song Dynasty was located had to surrender to the Jin and had to negotiate peace. Qin Hui's advocacy of peace was actually a mature plan for the country, with a unique service. His execution of Yue Fei also had the bitter intention of pacifying the internal and external troubles.</p>
<p>A song is used to publicize this matter. The song says:</p>
<p>Yue Fei was originally a bastard:</p>
<p>He deserved to be beheaded, his family confiscated, and disaster extended to his relatives;</p>
<p>Qin Hui was originally a hero:</p>
<p>Of course, he killed people, set fires, betrayed the country, sought peace, and enjoyed wealth and honor like Mount Tai!</p>
<p>"Bastard" and "hero" each accept,</p>
<p>Who cares about the worship and resentment of future generations!</p>
<p>Now people's hearts have changed greatly,</p>
<p>Yue Fei has experience</p>
<p>Qin Hui is not,</p>
<p>The former advocated peace,</p>
<p>The latter advocated war,</p>
<p>The fate of leaving a bad or good name also turns,</p>
<p>Each has a thousand years!</p>
<h3 id="e199">Impressions of Suzhou (4) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Zhen</p>
<p>Under the guidance of Pai, I took the small motorboat from Suzhou to Bentuo, advancing in the waves full of rural scenery. After more than two hours, I arrived at Bentuo. Bentuo is a small town near Suzhou City, with a very dense population. It is about six or seven miles from Bentuo to Tianping, passing Lingyan Mountain, you can reach Tianping Mountain directly. From Lingyan to Tianping Mountain, there are very wide imperial roads built, paved with bricks. According to Yuan, it was built by Emperor Qianlong when he went to the south of the Yangtze River, but hasn't it been buried in weeds until now?</p>
<p>When we were advancing on the imperial road buried in weeds, only the branches of the trees on both sides of the mountain were playing natural music to accompany our lonely companions; the sound of dry grass rustling under our feet also naturally echoed the singing of the branches, breaking the silence for a moment. 丨丨 No, it can also be said that it made the heart feel the silence of this mountain and field, so silent that there were only the rustling footsteps and the sound of the wind in the branches. The scenery of "a cicada chirping makes the forest more quiet, and a bird singing makes the mountain more secluded" in the poems of the ancients is only now being realized.</p>
<p>When we were walking on the imperial road, we also touched the reeds on both sides, which covered the earth as white as snow, and swayed east and west with the wind like willow catkins. Their light and graceful posture was like palace fairies wearing snow-white feather clothes, dancing in neon clothes. They were nodding to us, welcoming our arrival, they danced and danced with the wind, whether it was in the morning when the sun rose wearing colorful clothes, or in the evening when the sunset glow was dimming, they were always dancing. They appreciated themselves, didn't seek to be known, didn't like people's praise, and didn't care about people's ridicule; they always danced, they could really show a mocking smile to humans. But, no, they still warmly welcome us. When Chang'e hangs up her silver lantern, I think it must be the time when they are most proud. They are really for art, they are really respectable companions on our journey.</p>
<p>In a surprised gaze, I discovered very unusual strange rocks, standing on the mountain one by one. That is what Yuan told me about Tianping Mountain. Outside the Hongfo Temple at the foot of the mountain, there were many maple trees standing. They stood very tall, stubbornly maintaining their old spirit. Some of the leaves were still green like spring; but the green of spring was not their era, their era was coming; some of the leaves that got the weather first had gradually turned yellow, gradually turned red.</p>
<p>We walked up the mountain from the Buddhist temple, and there were many stone inscriptions on both sides, hurrying up the mountain, there was no time to look closely. A monk in the temple warmly greeted us, and many paintings and calligraphy were hung in the reception room. Next to the reception room, there is a bowl of Meng Spring, which uses a large tank to store water. The water is spring water, which is connected by a bamboo pole. The source of the water is very thin, flowing slowly. How clear and transparent it is, it is very pure, like transparent crystal; when the spring water falls into the tank, it is like crystal pearls merging together.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>Although the four glass-paneled folding doors to the main room were tightly shut, the bright electric light inside reflected everything on the surface clearly. Three young women were gathered around a square table, applying makeup. The one sitting directly across from Haiquan's line of sight was the clearest. Her face was covered in white powder, with extra red rouge on her cheeks. She was leaning forward, looking at a small mirror on the table, shaping her eyebrows as she drew them, talking all the while. He could only see her lips moving constantly but could not hear her voice. Haiquan looked at their bodies again; they were all wearing white velvet shirts, exposing a portion of their snow-white necks and chests. The pair of high peaks on their chests were also quite prominent. The other two, one with her back to Haiquan and one sitting sideways, were less clearly visible.</p>
<p>"How could daughters from ordinary families dress up like little actresses on a stage with all that rouge and powder?"</p>
<p>The scene inside stunned Haiquan. He was a little surprised and wondered if he had found the wrong house number. So, he looked up at the address above and saw clearly that it was number fifteen.</p>
<p>"This is clearly the home of women engaged in immoral professions. University student Zhuo Shuhua would never live in a place like this."</p>
<p>But then he thought of the previous criticisms that some university girls were high-class prostitutes. Could the lively Ms. Zhuo be this kind of woman?</p>
<p>He pondered for a moment, not daring to knock, but not wanting to leave either. Fortunately, a gust of cold wind carried the stench from the garbage bin to his nose, and he woke up as if from a dream, taking two or three steps toward the alley entrance.</p>
<p>"Ms. Zhuo is definitely not this kind of woman. I can assert that! ......"</p>
<p>He walked and thought, and later, as if an astronomer had discovered a special comet, a smile spread across his face. At the same time, he clenched his left fist tightly, striking a pose as if giving a speech.</p>
<p>"...Why? If she were such a frivolous woman, she would never have so frankly invited me to this place."</p>
<p>He thought for a moment. Then, he turned back again, returning to the door of number fifteen, made up his mind, and knocked on the door knocker.</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>As soon as he knocked, he heard someone inside asking.</p>
<p>Haiquan put his eyes to the crack in the door again, looking inside. One of the three women had already opened the screen door and was standing in the doorway of the main room.</p>
<p>"Is there someone named Zhuo living here?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Go around to the back door."</p>
<p>Haiquan was about to turn around when he suddenly heard someone calling him from above.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin? I'm sorry, please go to the back door. ......"</p>
<p>This was exactly the voice he had been waiting for. He hurriedly looked up and saw Zhuo Shuhua sticking half her body out of the upstairs window, smiling and waving at him. Her lively manner was no different from in school. Haiquan was so happy to see her that he couldn't even speak. He just,</p>

<p>| Year-End Interest Rates Are Seen As Fixed |</p>
<p>The Silver and Money Industry's Procedures Have Been Tedious In Recent Days. Transactions Have Been More Frequent. The Human Resources Department Is All Busy Ensuring the Year-End Closing. This Year, Because Commerce Is Sluggish, Not Much Has Been Loaned. This Is Enough to Meet the Year-End Closing. New Accounts Are Easier to Handle Than Last Year. However, Old Debts Are Frightening After Clearing Up. I Fear It Will Not Be Easy to Deal With. As for the Interest Rates, There Is No Grand Situation to Speak of During This Year-End Closing. However, Yesterday's Silver Dollar Transactions Were Still Not Weak. Probably Just Internal Buying and Selling Within the Industry.</p>
<p>The Silver Dollar's Rise and Fall Are Limited, and the Silver Interest Rate Is Still Opened at Two Fen. When the "Silver Dollar" Market Opened in the Morning, People's Hearts Were Dispersed. Although Banks Had an Appetite to Buy, There Was a Lack of Competition. Therefore, the Interest Rate Was Always Sluggish. The Closing Was at Seven Jiao One Fen Three Li Three Hao Seven Hu Ban, Slightly Smaller Than the Previous Day by One Hao Two Hu Ban. The Afternoon Market Then Turned Higher by Two Hao Ban, to Seven Jiao One Fen Three Li Six Hao Two Hu Ban. As a Result, It Was Better Than the Previous Afternoon by One Hao Two Hu Ban. The "Silver Interest Rate" in Both the Morning and Afternoon Markets Was Still Two Fen, Roughly the Same As the Previous Day. The Initial Interest Rate Was Still No More Than Two or Three Fen.

When "Replenishment Coins," Jiangnan Small Silver Dollars, Opened in the Morning Market, There Was an Intention to Get Rid of Them. Because There Were No Buyers, the Price Fell by One Fen. The Closing Was at Six Jiao Two Fen Five Li. Transactions in the Afternoon Market Were Few. The Price Trended Slightly Stronger, Slightly Better Than the Morning Market by Three Li, to Six Jiao Two Fen Eight Li. Transactions Were Done in the Morning Market for 7,100 Jiao, and in the Afternoon Market for 6,500 Jiao. Guangdong Small Silver Dollars Were at Six Jiao One Fen Eight Li in the Morning Market, and at Six Jiao One Fen Seven Li in the Afternoon Market. As a Result, It Was Changed to Slightly Smaller Than the Previous Afternoon by Half a Li. Transactions Were Done in the Morning Market for Ten Li Ling 5,000 Jiao, and in the Afternoon Market for 20,000 Jiao. Copper Coins Were Released Long-Term by 2,000 Wen, to 392 Strings. Transactions Were Done for Over 38,000 Strings of Wen. Silver Remittances and Settlements Are Trivial. Year-End Consolidation Relationships, Yesterday, Banks' Remittances and Settlements Were Due to the Year-End Closing. Regarding Remittance and Settlement Procedures, It Was Particularly Busy and Urgent. Especially the Most Were Payments and Remittances and Settlements of Special Loans from Japanese Merchants.

As for the Trend of Each Bond Price, the Initial Morning Was That It Was Difficult to Be Optimistic About the Environmental Situation. Various Parties Became Inclined to Sell. The Human Spirit of the Buyers Was Far More Prosperous Than Buying. Therefore, the Sharp Fall Was Extremely . However, Then the Demand Evened Out, and 上 Was Peaceful. The Afternoon Market Was , Especially Stagnant. Each Price Only Had a Four Jiao盘. The General Human Spirit Watched, and Transactions Were Few Therefore.

<p>The Yarn Market Continued to Rise. The Situation Is Relatively High. Because the Spot Yarn Demand Has Improved, People's Hearts Are 高, Plus the January Label Yarn Has Long Been Weak.

<p>The Cotton Market Is Firm, and the Trend Is Flat. Because a Certain Manufacturer Has Short Positions in Recent Months, There Is No Intention to Offset Them, and the Xihe Coarse Cotton Purchased in Tianjin Is Withdrawn in January , Because of This, People's Hearts Are Restrained, and Some Profit-Taking Bulls Take Advantage of the Rise to Settle. However, the Current American Situation Is Stable, Prices Are Rising Daily, and There Are Concerns That Exchange Rates Will Be Soft. The Market Is Still Difficult to Go Down. Therefore, General Buyers Tighten the Distant Months and Never Let Go.</p>

<h3 id="e226">On Being an Official <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Regarding being an official, I believe it is indeed a very important matter, and it is worth discussing.</p>
<p>Before our fathers had even added a copper top to their red-tasseled hats, they would dream day and night: Oh! From a student, to a scholar, from a scholar, to a licentiate, from a licentiate to a Jinshi, and then begin to be an official. If one wanted to be an honest official, one might as well be poor and be a small official in the capital. If one wanted to make a fortune, one would have to find a teacher and seek an outside post… Finally, of course, fire-branded servants would stand before the door, the stone lions would be flanked by tall flagpoles, and the ancestral hall would be filled with plaques from one's own family. How imposing, how magnificent! The ancestors' thick virtues would of course be fully realized, and there would even be the good fortune of cultivating oneself into an immortal. As for those who lacked virtue, alas…it goes without saying, even mentioning it would be heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Since this is the case, these fathers are our fathers, then accepting the teachings of our fathers is of course the duty of us sons. Thus, we must go from elementary school, to middle school, … to university, to studying abroad. But something seems a bit off. After studying abroad, can one necessarily become an official? That's a bit hard to say, so this road may not be passable. Therefore, if we follow our fathers' old ways, we will inevitably be fools.</p>
<p>So, what should we do? Of course, there is a reason.</p>
<p>Needless to say, everyone is a sensible person. To be an official, one does not necessarily need qualifications, and even less does one need worthless knowledge. Money goes without saying, but the most important thing is to be good at bragging. If you insist that you are a doctor, who will really check your diploma?</p>
<p>Then, after becoming an official, what should one do? This is even more worthy of study. At first, you must learn to wear a Zhongshan suit and carry a leather briefcase, and the briefcase must be filled to the brim. More importantly, you must be familiar with the Premier's will and practice three minutes of silence. When you are still a small official, you must endure your temper and be absolutely obedient. When the section chief scolds you for being a fool in official language, you must quickly respond with "Yes, yes, yes." If you are rewarded with a slap in the face, it is even more of a compliment. Then you must touch your burning face and say, "I dare not, I dare not!" As for being a high official, it is of course very different. Walking into the office, you might as well slam the table and shout, "Why hasn't it been done yet? The country is paying you, what are you doing!" But what exactly hasn't been done well? You don't have to worry about it, as long as the subordinates are submissive.</p>
<p>As for what benefits there are to being an official, even a rough villager who touches a cow's behind would know. Making a fortune goes without saying, and even marrying twenty concubines would not be considered bigamy by law. Generally speaking, a small official may not easily collude with foreign countries, but a high official can openly betray the country without any problem. If you are a military officer, the most taboo thing is to dare to confront imperialism. Domestic civil wars, on the other hand, can be fought several times. Occupying a territory is like occupying a treasure trove. Forcibly planting opium is an excellent method. Looking back at history, you can find many precedents. It is better to be infamous for ten thousand years than to be fragrant for a thousand years.</p>
<p>It's a long story, so I have to stop halfway. If there is a chance, I will explain it next time. Besides, Chinese scholars have always been well-versed in the way of being an official, so why should I, a junior, waste my breath?</p>
<h3 id="e227">The Confusion of Modern Women <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Ruizhen</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<h3 id="e228">Moisture-Proofing Matches <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Nong</p>
<p>We know that the method of preventing wood from getting damp is to coat it with a layer of paint. Similarly, this similar method can be applied to moisture-proofing matches. Crush a small amount of rosin and place it in alcohol, heat it to dissolve it, and then immerse the match heads in the solution. After a few minutes, take it out and let it dry. In this way, even if the matches are accidentally dropped into the water, they can still be lit.</p>
<p>Oiling Machine Belts</p>
<p>Applying a type of oil to the belts that rotate on machines can significantly increase the turning efficiency, and the belts will also last longer. This type of oil is made by cooking two parts of lead yellow with four or five parts of sesame oil in two parts of water until it becomes a gel. When using, mix it with an appropriate amount of turpentine.</p>
<p>Removing Old Paint Stains</p>
<p>A simple method for removing old paint stains from cotton fabrics is to mix one part of turpentine with two parts of ammonia solution, shake it vigorously to make it emulsify, and then use cotton wool or a brush to apply it to the old paint stains. After a few minutes, wait for the paint stains to soften, and then wipe it off with cotton.</p>
<p>A Homemade Glue</p>
<p>Sometimes we often have such a need to glue paper and leather together. If we use ordinary paste or glue to glue them, it is often not easy to stick, or even if it sticks, many wrinkles will be produced, which will easily come off. Therefore, it is best to make a kind of glue yourself that meets this need, that is, dissolve 200 parts of gum arabic and 1 part of tannic acid each in water, and then mix it with 50 parts of glycerin and 10 parts of glucose. One thing to pay attention to here is that the less water used when dissolving tannic acid, the better.</p>
<p>Writing on Glass</p>
<p>The easiest way to engrave something on glass is to simply use a steel pen dipped in silicic acid to write. However, the strokes engraved in this way are very thick. If you want to engrave very fine things, you must apply the following method!</p>
<p>Place one and a half liters of water in each of two glass bottles and dissolve 18 grams of hydrofluoric acid and grams of sulfide.

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>I never thought that I would meet you, who had been missing for five years, in such a gathering. When you receive this letter, don't be surprised, because I am not used to sitting for a long time in this annoying jazz music. Thank you for telling me the address, so I will write here about my situation after we parted, which you were eager to know last night.</p>
<p>Five years ago, in my hometown, I was undeniably regarded as a dissolute child. You are a descendant of a scholarly family and the daughter of a noble family. After regarding my unwarranted sins as facts, you no longer met with me. So I was expelled from my hometown. For five years, I have been racking my brains and working my body, exchanging sweat and blood for three meals a day. Looking back, among my many fellow villagers, if you say I am a dissolute child, I really can't find a reason, because I have tasted too much bitterness, so I have also met many kinds of people. A few days before the New World held this great and grand National Salvation Entertainment Conference, I was forced by a friend to buy a few tickets. Of course, since the September 18th Incident, from the Northeast Volunteer Army fighting bloody battles against the Japanese to today, every citizen who cannot go to the front line should do their best to fulfill their national responsibility. So, no matter how poor my purse was that day, I generously bought them. Last night, without asking Little Confused whether it was an auspicious day, I made an appointment with a few friends to go to the New World during a week of work. With my head held high, I followed the crowd into the New World. I knew it wasn't like coming in to play for two cents as usual. Stepping into the dance hall was naturally not accidental, but I, a dissolute child, made an exception for the first time. Who would have thought I would meet my sister, who had been missing for five years? I felt that I had lost more than I gained by being branded as a "dissolute child."</p>
<p>Sister, you are the daughter of a noble family, how can you be involved in a group of dancers, so that you can't tell your worth? A white face, red lips, piled with messy black hair, matched with a body trembling in a narrow cheongsam, everything, if you don't mind, I'm afraid you will also be covered with the suspicion of a "dissolute girl." However, in these chaotic years, even if the country is about to be destroyed, it can be put aside (please forgive me for saying such cold-blooded words). I still have to earn three meals of bitter tea and light meals every day. It's really going to be regarded as a "dissolute child" if I tell you these irrelevant words.</p>
<p>However, after exchanging a few words with your Mr. Li last night, I know that you are doing your best to help this National Salvation Entertainment Conference. I said in the tone of an old man, "Please start from the root." As for me, I haven't made a fortune in five years and can't wear the "dancing to save the country" suit like your Mr. Li, but I am still well-behaved and still retain the true colors of a "dissolute child" five years ago. I don't dare to boast in front of others after spending two or three yuan on such a major event as "saving the country." Sister, if you are willing to give me some advice, please tell me, what kind of thing is "saving the country"?</p>
<p>The final statement is that I didn't have the intention of "dancing to save the country" when I stepped into the dance hall last night.</p>

<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>I have been unemployed since last month. God! I am not a bourgeois capitalist, so the panic and pain of life are needless to say. The most embarrassing thing for me is the sarcasm of the people around me. It's no wonder they want to insult me, because I am already a so-called unemployed vagrant!</p>
<p>Fang! Wife! She is very understanding. Although she suffers with me, she has no complaints, unlike the love of so-called modern women, which is completely based on money. But I, this useless husband, just feel ashamed. There is also my white-haired old father, who still cannot be fed and clothed. Alas! I, this unfilial son!</p>
<p>Yesterday I took my son, Xiong'er, for a stroll on the street. In fact, my heart was surging with thoughts, so I had no leisure to stroll.</p>
<p>Xiong'er really asked me with a surprised look:</p>
<p>"Daddy! Yesterday, Ming'er! His little friend! Insulted me for being a poor ghost. I thought it was true. Why do other people eat fat fish and big meat and live in high-rise buildings? Why are we so miserable?"</p>
<p>My fragile heartstrings were violently stimulated, and two lines of hot tears involuntarily burst out due to emotional impulses.</p>
<p>"Daddy! You were talking and laughing just now. Why are you crying now? I can't agree with you! Daddy! Did I say something wrong? Daddy, don't cry anymore." Xiong'er raised his small hand in horror and wiped away my crystal tears.</p>
<p>"No! Child!" I stroked her short hair and said softly to him, "Don't you want to eat fat fish and big meat? Child! Blame our bad fate. We are people who have been forgotten by happiness!" He seemed to understand what I meant and nodded slowly.</p>
<p>On the way back, I thought that since I lost my job, the more valuable clothes have been pawned at Changsheng Pawnshop. The autumn wind has risen and there are no warm clothes. No! I don't even have money for tomorrow's meal. The accumulated rent, debts, and everything will be pressing down on me. "Alas! What is really good?" I, a weak person, uttered a cry of sorrow.</p>
<p>Alas! God, how cruel you are to people. God of happiness, you have long forgotten me!……Poor people can only……!</p>

<p>Reading, Entertainment, and Sports Combined Editor:</p>
<p>After reading the three organizations in your column, I have some thoughts! Because these "Weekly Academic Discussion Meeting," "Amateur Peking Opera Research Society," and "Amateur National Martial Arts Group" are all very narrowly defined. I think it is better to expand a little and have a whole organization rather than one organization in the east and one in the west. It is more systematic and more effective. So my idea is to combine all the clerks and apprentices and organize a "Business Youth Life Mutual Aid Society" to summarize all the above small organizations in one place. Wouldn't it be more beneficial to the interests of our clerks and apprentices? However, such an organization cannot be successful with just a few people. I would like to provide our clerks and apprentices with a chance to study and research.</p>
<p>I have had this idea for many years, but because of the environment, I have never been determined to do it, and my personal ability is limited. Moreover, I have now left the business world. Although I used to be an apprentice, a clerk, and then a store owner, it is all in the past.</p>
<p>I now hope that our staff and apprentices should automatically organize themselves to seek their own life development and solve the problems of physical, moral, intellectual, group, and all other aspects.</p>
<p>This is my little opinion, offered to the clerks and apprentices for everyone to study and research.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>After reading the "Organization of Three Groups" in your column, I have an opinion to offer.</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Zhang uses his spare time on Sundays to exchange knowledge with each other; (2) Mr. Ma and Mr. Chen use their spare time for proper entertainment; (3) Mr. Zhou advocates the inherent Chinese martial arts to temper everyone's physique. I think all three are right and there is a need for connection.</p>
<p>Because knowledge is something that everyone needs and is endless; at the same time, in order to increase the efficiency of doing things, one must have a strong physique; to avoid the boredom and dullness of life, one must rely on proper entertainment to regulate. Since these three are all needed in life, why not expand the organization and connect with each other? What do you gentlemen think?</p>
<p>Meng Yin, December 24th</p>
<p>× × × ×</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I have silently observed the psychology of most people in society and found that they always have some differences: because of the differences in psychology, their views and interests in things are also different.</p>
<p>For example, most people who focus on literature do not like sports, resulting in a weak body that easily gets sick. If it is incurable, wouldn't it be a great pity? Or those who are proficient in national martial arts, whose strength is enough to lift a tripod, but who are "illiterate" and "unable to solve difficult problems," will undoubtedly be despised by society. As for entertainment, as long as it is proper, it is also an enjoyment that should be had in the course of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my humble opinion, in order to develop scholarship and physique at the same time, and then use proper entertainment to regulate life, we must combine reading, entertainment, and sports into one. Moreover, we can connect everyone's feelings and regulate different mentalities: by this, we can also consolidate the common front of our youth and concentrate the fighting power of our youth. Ask Mr. Ma and Mr. Zhou and the readers of Shangming, is it right or wrong?</p>
<p>Zhang Siwei, December 24th.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The above three letters actually want the three individual groups to unite into one large group by appointment. The intention is very good.</p>
<p>However, we also offered a little opinion in the "Organization of Three Groups", that is, (1) be cautious before organizing; (2) be persistent after organizing; (3) do not have thoughts of rights, and be able to take responsibility.</p>
<p>Dear readers: We feel that the social problems are serious and cannot be solved by a few people. If you really want to find a solution, you must rely on the power of the masses. So we are also willing to support from the side and see you achieve it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But this is everyone's business. Before many readers express their opinions, we will of course not express any opinions.</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>He picked up the dry tobacco pipe on the table and looked at it, turning it around with both hands for a few times. He lowered his head and wondered what he should say to justify himself. Sister-in-law Wang had been paying attention to him for a long time, thinking that he wanted to smoke the dry tobacco, so she reached into her pocket, groped for a while, and took out six or seven red-headed matches, all of which were placed on the table, and smiled: You smoke. Meng Guobao smiled: Country people are really thrifty. A few foreign matches are like treasures. Probably the electricity used by city people for one night is enough for country people's foreign match money for a lifetime. After Sister-in-law Wang brought the matches over, he never retreated to the door frame, standing on the side of the table, holding one corner of the short table, and smiling at him: Yesterday, Mr. Meng talked about the things in the city so fun. I still want to hear more. Meng Guobao smiled: I will stay in the countryside for a few more days. When it is cool in the evening, I will talk to you. Wang Laoer put down the teacup, stretched, and yawned: I have to go and see the water in the field ditch. Meng Guobao stood up and smiled: That's right, I'm a little confused, how can I talk to you at noon and delay your work. Saying that, he stood up and walked towards the door. Sister-in-law Wang followed behind for two steps and smiled: It doesn't matter if you sit for a while. He went up the slope, and I didn't go. Meng Guobao had already left, and he couldn't go back, so he had to go home. He walked smoothly, walking along the embankment of the grass pond. The embankment was planted with catalpa trees, cypress branches, and the like. The shade of the trees covered the pond, and you could see large blue fish a foot long swimming in the water. So he stood under the tree, staring at the water in a daze. His heart was not on the fish, but on Sister-in-law Wang. He felt that country women were afraid of people and not afraid of people, not generous and generous, with a special kind of charm. Sister-in-law Wang had such good skin and such even bones and flesh. She really didn't look like a country woman, and she didn't look like the wife of a husband like Wang Laoer. Why did I have a good impression of her at first sight? I really don't understand. Oh! That's right. Doesn't she look a bit like Ms. Huanghou Shangsailan from Women's No. 1 High School? That's right, her dark eyes and long eyelashes are all similar. Just as he was thinking this, he heard a series of loud noises coming from the surface of the water. Looking up, on a washing stone across the pond, a woman was kneeling, holding a washing mallet in her hand, beating the clothes. It was Sister-in-law Wang, but she was wearing an old blue cloth jacket before, but now she was wearing a white coarse cloth jacket. When Meng Guobao looked over from this side, she stopped hammering the clothes and said loudly towards this side: Mr. Meng, you haven't left yet. Meng Guobao said: There are big fish in this pond. The more I look at them, the more I like them. As he spoke, he was afraid that the road was too far and it was a little difficult to hear clearly, so he walked back and stood under a weeping willow, holding the trunk of the tree, and said: Where's Laoer? Sister-in-law said: He went up the slope. As she spoke, she rolled up her sleeves, and her arms from below her elbows were exposed, so thick and strong, showing a kind of healthy beauty. She pressed the clothes with both hands, constantly rubbing them in the water or on the stone.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Hollywood Prophet Says About Jean Harlow's Future (Part 1) <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>After Jean Harlow continuously appeared with us in Shanghai-screened films such as "Platinum Blonde," "Goldie," and "Red-Headed Woman," the image of this blonde girl remains vividly in our minds. The death of Jean Harlow's husband, the famous director Paul Bern, by suicide, also caused a worldwide sensation, and this publication has previously reported on it. Therefore, the future of Jean Harlow is something many people want to know, and perhaps there is no need to first provide a detailed introduction to Jean's past.</p>
<p>The questions we want to know about Jean are: What is Jean doing now since her husband died? What will her future life be like? Can she permanently exist on the silver screen? And will she remarry, and will remarriage bring her happiness and recovery? Many people who care about Jean Harlow have already asked these questions repeatedly. But who can answer questions about a person's future? Even Jean herself cannot answer everything with the saying "Man can conquer nature." Now, three Hollywood prophets have answered these questions one by one. Why don't we adopt the attitude of "taking it with a grain of salt" and first publish it in our newspaper? If, after a year, what the Hollywood prophets have said has been confirmed one by one, wouldn't these few foreign "Zhuge Liangs" be more insightful than our blind fortune tellers?</p>
<p>These three prophets, one is good at observing celestial phenomena; one judges the future from tea leaves; and one perceives through a crystal ball. They have jointly torn open the curtain of the future, revealing the secrets of heaven. You may not believe their myths, but Jean Harlow herself has deeply converted to them.</p>
<p>Ms. Minnie Flyun, who was once famous on Broadway, is now the most prestigious prophet in Hollywood. A month before Paul married Jean, she discovered from tea leaves that a major figure in the film industry would soon encounter death, and that his death would be discovered within two months of marrying a blonde actress. After his death, the surroundings were shrouded in a mysterious atmosphere, and his death was most likely suicide. The above predictions have now all been proven true, because Paul married Jean for two months, and Paul has already shot himself in the head with a lead bullet and died. Minnie Flyun has many past miracles. Before Valentino died, she told Pola Negri that Valentino would soon die in the East. At that time, Valentino was not yet ill. Later, Valentino indeed fell ill and died in New York. She knew about the death of Ziegfeld, the great show business owner, before he died. Before the American giant ship Titanic struck a reef and sank in the Atlantic, she warned several important figures, who then changed to other ships and avoided the disaster. The following is Minnie's prediction for Jean Harlow:</p>
<p>"I see many things for Jean. I see that she will remarry within two years, to someone from the East. He is not in the film industry, but he has a slight connection to the film business. I believe she will be happy after remarrying, but many, many accidents will occur in the meantime.</p>
<p>"Jean will not leave the film industry because of this. The 'Red Dust' she is currently starring in will definitely be more popular than 'Hell's Angels' and 'Red-Headed Woman.' She will continue to play 'sex' roles. Between March and May of next year, there will be a scandalous case that will involve an Eastern businessman and a female writer in the film industry. This case will definitely be big, but it will not cause any harm to Jean.</p>
<p>"Although Paul Bern's death now feels extremely mysterious, it will definitely suddenly come to light soon, and Jean will not be involved in any unfavorable way." (To be continued)</p>
<p>Ms. Constance Bennett's most brilliant work since she started acting in movies is "What Price Hollywood?" The film will premiere tomorrow at the New Grand Theater.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e235">Review of "The Mayor's Nest" <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>"The Mayor's Nest" is basically a comedy entirely sustained by "nonsense."</p>
<p>Sydney Howard plays a down-on-his-luck trumpet player who, because he is unemployed, spends his days looking for good fortune on the streets. Coincidentally, he meets an old lady who appreciates him very much. She campaigns for him to join the city council. Because he has experienced the taste of poverty, he advocates for the happiness of the common people. As a result, he gains popular support and is elected mayor. However, he still does not change his original intentions and enjoys himself with the people.</p>
<p>The foundation of such a script is based on "coincidence" and "fate." Rationally speaking, such lucky events simply do not exist in the world, especially for someone as foolish as the person Sydney plays. Strictly speaking, this film is nonsensical. However, in the excessive description, we can see that it still has some vitality. For example, it clearly states that "the gain of a fool" should not discourage those who are unsuccessful. At the same time, it also frankly describes that in British and American politics, the mayor does not necessarily have to be capable, but must be welcomed by the entire city to stand firm.</p>
<p>As for a completely comical and tasteless film, there is not much to comment on the director. Other technical aspects are also mediocre, but they can all be considered thoughtful. The contrasting scenes before and after are worth watching.</p>
<p>Sydney is truly an old-fashioned comedian. He doesn't use anything to assist him, but relies solely on his attitude, movements, and words to win the audience's laughter. His performance still follows the path he has taken in the past. I don't think that's outdated. I think it can give people a change of pace. The results this time are similar to "City Lights" and "Sea Breezes." Of course, it's not a regression, but there's no significant progress either. The two supporting actors, Claude Hulbert and Muriel Aked, are both very good, and people can't help but laugh when they see them. All the actors together have a humorous ability. The songs sung and the music played are also good stimulants.</p>
<p>One more thing to say is that it has a lot in common with "Gabriel Over the White House."</p>
<p>There are many laughs. If you are unhappy, then you can really go to Nanjing to laugh for an hour. Among British films, this film is rare!</p>
<p>Finally: I have to ask the authorities of the Nanjing Grand Theater, since this film is not long, then the supporting films are of course more important. But the three films shown yesterday, two of which were produced by "Pathe," were clearly made two weeks ago. (I don't remember if New Light has shown them, maybe Nanjing itself has shown them). I hope the first-class theaters will also pay more attention to these short films.</p>
<p>Edward G. Robinson's Anecdotes</p>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>"Edward G. Robinson, the protagonist of 'The Secret of the Blue Room,' which premiered at the Cathay, is Romanian and grew up in America. He has a superstition. He says that no matter what film he makes, his wife, Doris Lloyd, must join in, at least occupying a few scenes, regardless of the importance of the role, otherwise there will be no good results. So in 'Smart Money,' she played a waitress, and in 'Tiger Shark,' she played a guest at a wedding scene.</p>
<p>Also, cigars are his only hobby. People in Hollywood have never seen his mouth or hand without a cigar. When he is at home, he always smokes a pipe. In his house, there are all kinds of different sizes of pipes.</p>

<p>— Shi Hongjun</p>
<p>Hollywood is the hometown of film talent. We must pay attention that the maturation of each star is not accidental. In her process, there must be her brave spirit, patient mind, and a history of struggling against her environment. The few stars mentioned here are all good examples for us.</p>
<p>Many people say that when the hot girl Clara Bow plays each role, her background often depicts her past and the resilient spirit of fighting life. Indeed, she has a very resilient spirit. She was born in Brooklyn. Her mother was ill. Clara's mother died when she was young, and her father was a waiter. She was very smart by nature. When she was not yet ten years old, she already understood the ways of the world. She knew that she was a poor orphan. In her teens, she grew up to be very beautiful, which gave her the opportunity to enter the film industry. When she first entered the film industry, she concealed her family situation, so no one laughed at her poverty.</p>
<p>Greta Garbo, who has recently gained fame, although she is only twenty-six years old, has gone through many servile lives in the past. She has worked as an assistant in a barber shop, as a model in a women's accessories store, and as a worthless actress. Then she drifted to Hollywood. When she first arrived in Hollywood, she was wearing a ragged skirt, short clothes, and thread socks. She did not understand the situation of life in the film industry at all. The arrogant and luxurious figures in Hollywood looked at her and were stunned and laughed. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Hollywood telegram, 28th. American film star Mary Pickford was filming a new film today when a lamp suddenly fell and hit her forehead and eyebrows. Mary immediately fell and fainted. Her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, rushed her into her dressing room, and she gradually regained consciousness. The doctor said that the injury was not serious, but there was a broken skin on her forehead. It is feared that the filming work will be postponed until the scars have completely disappeared.

<p>— Kang Bing</p>
<p>The lawsuit between Charlie Chaplin and his ex-wife Lita Grey over the issue of preventing his two children from entering the screen has now been declared over. Charlie has won the case. He is now preparing a reserve of 20,000 yuan to support his two children.</p>
<p>However, how does Charlie plan to arrange the future of his two children? Everyone is curiously inquiring. Does he hope to train them to become mechanics? Lawyers? Doctors, or politicians? Or even cooks? However, because Charlie's nature is unwilling to publicly disclose his own private affairs, this question is ultimately shelved.</p>
<p>Although he treasures his private affairs in this way, some opinions about his two children have been collected here. He believes that they should have a considerable education, which is more important than anything else. He is confident that they should have an opportunity to develop freely until they can decide their own profession. However, Charlie is very hasty about everything, so although he says so, it is not known whether the plan for these two children will change in the future. Maybe it will be like Douglas Fairbanks initially preventing Little Douglas Fairbanks from devoting himself to the screen, but now Little Douglas Fairbanks has become a star.</p>
<p>He is now thinking of writing a travelogue of his recent travels. He estimates it will be 50,000 words long. He said that the last part of this travelogue is more difficult to write than the beginning. However, he has recently finished the final chapter of more than 5,000 words.</p>
<p>Charlie's opinion on sound issues now seems to have changed slightly. He still believes that silent films occupy a quiet art, and he is very satisfied with the results of "City Lights." He has not yet decided whether his new film will be a silent film or a sound film. However, if it is a sound film, we can see a change in his style, or he may only direct and not act.</p>
<p>Star Biography</p>
<h3 id="e239">A Brief History of Dolores del Río <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>丨The Mourner on the River丨</p>
<p>Dolores del Río, which translated into Spanish, means "The Mourner on the River." She was born in Mexico on August 3, 1905. She is a famous social flower in Mexican society. Before she entered the film industry, her original name was Dolores Asunsolo, a wealthy and noble Mexican lady. She was educated in Paris. Her intelligence is almost the same as her beauty. Her skin is like honey, smooth and light yellow. There is also a kind of jade-like purity of stone sculptures. This natural beauty is enough to make the many female stars in Hollywood pale in comparison. Her cloud-like hair and a pair of melancholy and affectionate eyes will fascinate anyone who sees them.</p>
<p>When Dolores was sixteen years old, she left school. At the same time, she married Mr. Jaime Del Río.</p>
<p>Although there are many frustrated people in Mexico, this couple had a happy ending. After their marriage, the two went to Europe on their honeymoon. During their leisure time, they concentrated on learning to dance. They once performed before the Spanish Emperor and Empress.</p>
<p>In 1925, the couple met a director in Mexico City named Edwin Carewe and went to Hollywood together, but she had never thought of movies before.</p>
<p>She first tried in the film "Joanna," starring Dorothy Mackaill, and became famous. Director Carewe praised her unparalleled appearance and performance art. He refused to let her go. She had to star in "High Steppers," "Resurrection," "Carmen," "The Loves of Carmen," and "Ramona" over and over again. Her sound film masterpiece is "Bad Girl." The lady is five feet five inches tall, weighs 110 pounds, with jade-colored black hair and beautiful brown eyes. She likes to sunbathe on the beach the most. She has a special interest in literature. During her leisure time, she always holds books and reads tirelessly. She can also speak five languages, making her the number one female star in Hollywood.</p>

<p>The twelfth expression practice is similar to the fourth. It is also a transition from fear to doubt.</p>
<p>The learner should first make a fearful expression in front of the mirror. Then, they seem to discover that the object of the previous fear does not exist. It is entirely a mistake of their own vision, but they dare not deny the existence of the object. Therefore, the eye sockets gradually shrink, and the mouth gradually closes tightly, making a "Huh? Wrong!" sound from the throat.</p>
<p>At this time, your head may shake naturally a couple of times. This is correct, because it is enough to prove that your emotion is indeed doubt.</p>
<p>The thirteenth style is connected to the twelfth style, so you should continue to practice.</p>
<p>Restore to the state of doubt just now, and then, like searching for the object that suddenly appeared just now and made you fearful, look at the shadow in the mirror with a detective-like gaze. Sure enough, the object has been found by you. It turns out that the person you usually look down on the most and are most unwilling to pay attention to is hiding there and joking with you.</p>
<p>Your gaze gradually turns into a state of jealousy. Stare straight at the shadow in the mirror. First, see if this expression can satisfy your own intentions. Then, use all your strength, after humming in the nasal cavity, shout loudly "What are you!"</p>
<p>Then, carefully observe how much power is added to your expression with the help of this pronunciation.</p>
