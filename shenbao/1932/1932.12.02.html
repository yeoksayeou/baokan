<p>杜白林國聯行政院主席凡勒拉由日内瓦歸來今日抵此、表示其對於中日問題之意見、謂國聯各會員國、他日切實表示必欲維持國聯盟約及和平與不侵略條約之原則時、則爭案解决辦法、不難獲之、凡愼重展讀李頓報告書而承認其所述事實者、皆可知所以解决之道、在國聯監視之下、雙方合法利益可得保障、直至東三省人民能自已决定、對於中國願有何等密切政治關係而後已凡氏預料日内瓦事件之進行或如下述、國聯大會將考慮李頓報告書、復交十九特委員會草擬决議案與報告書、然後再舉行國聯大會之全體會議、十九特委會之報告書、其結果大約爲調解委員會之成立、此種進程之各段落、在十二月二十日左右或可完成云、凡氏不欲復返日内瓦、大約將以自由邦郵電部長康諾萊爲其代表、（路透社一日電）</p>

<p>討論僅四十五分鐘　　議决召集特别大會（日内瓦）國聯十九國委員會、已於今晨十一時十分、在行政院會議室開會、開始籌備國聯大會召集特别會議事宜、最初爲秘密會議、歷十分鐘後、乃將會議公開、准新聞記者與旁聽公衆入席、主席希孟、遂於十一時二十分在圍坐會議桌四周之十九國委員間、宣告公開會議開幕、</p>
<h3 id="c4">决定召集特别大會 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>於是希孟首即宣布、國聯大會業已召集特别會議、定於下星期二開會、並說明此舉未先經十九國委員會正式通過之理由、謂中日爭執、業於二月十九日决議案、提交國聯大會、故此時已無再行諮商之必要、行政院主席凡勒拉曾謂在國聯大會内、將畀各會員完滿之發言機會、諒諸君定將與余同意、認國聯大會有召集特别會議之必要、希望各委員對於此舉不生異議、主席說明後、以在座無人發言、遂宣告召集國聯大會特别會議一舉、業經正式通過、</p>

<p>旣而希孟宣讀中代表顔惠慶十一月二十九日去函、質問日前行政院會議所通過六閱月解决爭執原限、届滿後之展期、將至何時爲止、函末聲稱、中國愛國之士、猶在滿洲抗戰日人、以圖脫去非法之外人統治、此種侵略行爲、使滿洲華人繼續感受痛苦、亟宜加以制止云云、</p>
<p>希孟乃詳細解釋六個月原限展期之理由、頗多就法律點加以說明、謂十九國委員會倘告同意、渠將通知顔博士、在國聯大會開始討論以前、不能規定展期之時限、希孟嗣謂、余思在十九國委員會討論李頓報告與中日意見之前、應先由國聯大會加以研究、捷克外長皮尼士贊同希孟主張、但請委員會以確定的語氣、規定俟大會開會後、儘速速召集委員會議之時限、</p>

<p>希孟嗣乃略述十九國委員會與大會分功合作之程序、謂大會首將討論李頓報告、俟各會員國之參加辯論者、悉行陳述意見後、於是重行開十九國委員會議、商定一最後决議之時限、送交大會、</p>
<p>瑞士代表莫泰乃請會中竭力避免拖延時日、謂此惡例一開、將生嚴重之結果、並聲明贊同行政院不討論李頓報告之决議謂國聯大會、實較適於討論國際調查圑之報告、</p>
<p>英外務次官艾登聲明贊成希孟主張、謂不論十九國委員會本意如何、吾輩此時實無從規定展期之時限、必須待大會討論之後、方能酌定、事絶顯明、蓋因此案甚爲重要、吾輩必須稍待也、</p>
<p>愛爾蘭代表康諾萊乃起詢、十九國委員會决定最後决議之時限後、國聯大會有無開會通過委員會所定時限之必要、並請會中盡力减少遲延、謂若所定時限、須經國聯大會通過、則進行不免延緩希孟答稱、渠不能贊同康諾萊君所稱、此種手續、將增加遲延之語、並謂願於星期二再與諸君在大會相見、遂於十一時五十五分正式宣告休會、（國民一日電）</p>

<p>公開會議僅三日　　日代表積極活動　　（東京）日外部接到日内瓦代表部報告云、十二月六日之國聯特别大會順序、决定先請中日兩國代表演說、繼請各小國發表意見、然後交委員會審查、如此程序、則可謂採納日本之要求、按日代表對大會原係力避大會公决、請大會另組一專門委員會審查李頓報告書、企圖遷延大會、糊塗了事、日外部以爲國聯無力制裁、已决心遷就日本云、（華聯一日電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外部聞英法首相將親臨大會、遂令松岡洋右專與兩首相周旋、另派國聯事務次長杉村及伊藤、分擔操縱國聯及拉攏各小國、昨日已分頭進行工作云、（華聯一日電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）國聯臨時大會將於六日開會、參加大會之主要國、於昨日午後成立内約、爲將中日紛爭、委託十九國委員會之前、在大會不提出不承認［滿洲國］之一切决議、因英·法·意·等大國、若參加小國方面之不承認［滿洲國］决議、則有害國聯大會之協調的努力云、（電通三十日電）</p>

<p>（東京）日内瓦來電、臨時大會自十二月六日起開公開會議三日、然後將中日問題移交十九國委員會、故三日間大會、其實質無異於演說大會、不能期待任何展開、其結局似由五六國代表組織基礎委員會研究解决之途、此解决方法能否於本年内成立、未能豫測、據聞國聯當局關於此調解委員會之見解如次、（一）調解委員會並非具有第三者裁斷當事國紛爭之機能、得中日兩當事國之參加後、始依據會章第十五條第三項研究調解手續、（二）會員會開會地點在倫敦、則於日本非無利益、（日聯一日電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）本月六日開會之國聯大會、六七兩日最遲至八日止、中日代表以外各國代表之演說、可以完畢、豫定即將問題移交、九國繼續委員會、一般討論完畢後、於附托委員會之前、並不提出不承認滿洲國决議等、參加總會各國間已成立諒解、故一日之十九國委員會僅爲形式的、而興味之中心、則集中於大會一般討論後之十九國委員會、惟聖誕節在即、該委員會亦不能繼續審議至十二月十七日以後、據第三者觀察、結果或不得不延至來年、又大會會場决使用軍縮議事堂（電通一日電）</p>

<h3 id="c11">松岡又一說帖 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>其欲一手掩盡天下耳目乎（日内瓦）國聯秘書處以日代表松岡說帖、分送行政院各理事、該說帖駁覆十一月二十日中代表顧維鈞所提出之各點、顧言及隨李頓調查圑在東三省調查時所遇之種種留難、松岡說帖謂不歡迎顧博士者、爲［滿洲國］政府反對其入境、而日政府不獨勸令［滿洲國］許顧入境、且於顧在東京時、予以生命上之保護云、</p>
<p>松岡說帖、論中國情形、謂日人未見中國内亂有</p>
<p>在許多年内可止之氣象、但日本從未抛棄早覩中國統一之希望、不幸日本現不能如李頓調查圑所抱中國可早日穩定之希望、至於日本屢次設法阻撓中國統一工作之責言、殊無根據、中國過去二十年中之内戰、未有一次、其野心軍人、不歡迎日本軍火與金錢之援助者、孫總理自已亦曾乞助於日本、孫避居日本、但未能從日本　得援助、以進行其革命計畫、如其從俄國所獲得者、日人欲中國革命之中止而非其繼續、日人今猶欲其終止也云、</p>
<p>顧博士言及袁世凱統一中國、事敗垂成、日本操縱有以致之、松岡說帖駁稱、袁世凱總統之被推翻完全由於華人之反對、而反對最力者、厥爲孫總理、一刀二七年八月、日本之出兵濟南、保護日僑、並不阻遏蔣介石國民軍之北進、破壞蔣介石之計畫者、乃武漢共産政府之活動、一九二八年五月十八日田中宣言、日本不得已或將採行適當辦法、以維持東三省之治安與秩序、田中所以有此宣言者因中國軍隊、在平津區域戰爭後、有擾及東三省之危險也、</p>
<p>松岡說帖言及張作霖遇害事、謂消滅老張、非日本之利益、日政府聞其死訊、爲之震動而失望焉、若謂日本以統一的中國、爲其開拓政策及征服世界夢之打擊、此爲荒謬之談、日本深慮新中國之發展、及其所趨向之前途、此種　慮、乃問題中之要點一說、日人對之、殊爲扼腕亦猶中代表對之表示歡迎也、日人所抱恨者中國現趨向無法紀而行、並非向秩序前進、中國之不遵守條約、乃中外發生爭論與困難之原因、華府會議所通過之各種議案、中國對之、負有種種義務者、依然未見履行、國民政府能否及願否履行中代表所發表之任何約言、亦毫無保證、欲維持九國公約·巴黎非戰公約及國聯盟約之尊嚴、則簽字國之不得施行仇外政策、實爲重要、中國前曾依允採行充分辦法、免除因僞造的出中奏章傳播於外、而發生之惡影響、但中國雖有此依允、而中代表竟公然散播之、且在行政院中利用之、</p>
<p>松岡說帖繼言及排貨問題、謂外國因中國情勢擾攘而採行之非常辦法、中國對之、輒以排貨相制故中國之排日運動、並非對於日本軍事計畫之報復行爲、松帖說帖謂國民黨與國民政府間之關係同於共産國際與蘇俄政府間之關係、說帖復　舉在華外人與敎士等不安全之案件、說帖否認外國官員所稱、中國未有排外情感微象之說、說帖之言及［滿洲國］政府接收鹽務稽核所、海關·郵局·電局·路礦機關並没收若干稅項事、謂此乃［滿洲國］成立後之天然結果、全屬新政府範圍以内之事、</p>
<p>說帖末言及上海事件、謂華兵之反抗、出於意外、日兵寡不敵衆、尤感困難者、須從街市中作戰、以應付華兵所踞守之房屋、日軍不得不擊破十九路軍、而竟擊敗之、但華人俄國式之宣傳、淆亂事實、實則日軍之迅速完全退出上海附近區域、足爲日本意志之充分明證、中日人民生命財産之損失固屬可憾、但中國平民之生命、現時常死於華軍之手者、較此猶多、各省平民喪失生命者、以數百萬計、城邑之爲國民軍共産軍及其他軍隊刦掠者、又不知凡幾、其能幸獲安全者厥爲外人所保護之通商口岸、中國商家與銀行家咸集於此、卽中國官員亦託庇於此也云云、路透社一日電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<p>法蘇互不侵犯條約成立之後又玄一、蘇聯的本質俄國帝政倒壞革命成功。在俄國歷史上固爲空前之大變革而一般見解。亦因此發生變化。吾人回憶歐戰末期世界最初發現社會主義蘇維埃政權時資本主義各國乃試行干涉蘇俄之成長。而蘇俄亦欲一脚踢翻資本主義。在此干涉時期中蘇俄盡其全力意圖掀動所謂世界革命然而社會主義的蘇聯并未因各國之干涉而倒塌資本主義社會更未以蘇聯之　大宣傳而崩潰。</p>
<p>資本主義國家大戰以還愓於自身之危機。忙於内部之整理。所謂對蘇聯之干步政策。早成過去。現時猶存者。蓋爲一種宣傳作用耳。在蘇聯方面旣讅知資本主義之建立。决非偶然鑄成。其傾倒也亦不能憑一時氣憤故新經濟政策實施以至於五年計劃。皆着重於其國内之建設。亦早已放棄其推倒資本主義之積極政策。甚至因俄國社會之落後。而竟用資本主義之成法。引用各國專門人才。以圖蘇聯之建設。雖號爲社會主義實乃集中資本於國家也。　　而所謂［赤化宣傳］也者。剖其内容。亦不過蘇聯之於資本主義各國對蘇干涉之一種抵抗手段。換言之亦爲一種變相的自衛方法。各國對蘇干涉。旣已停手。一般外交亦漸恢復。於是［赤化］宣傳氣燄。亦見衰落。蘇聯與各國間裂痕日見平復。雖政體各異。制度不同而國與國間之衝突亦非以前想像之劇烈矣。列寗生時會謂。［我們不想干涉他國的内政。可是也不願人家干涉我們···］其自重之意。溢於言表。蘇聯固不肯以其尺寸之地與人。亦不願侵人尺寸之地。是以標榜和平政策。先與西線鄰近諸國如土爾其如里斯　多尼亞如立陶宛。如阿富汗。如德意意志。均先後訂立互不侵犯條約。而主要各國除德國另有特殊關係而外。其他各國仍僅尋常之外交而已。　　二、國際關係之巨變現世界國際關係。就一般眼不之觀察。以爲國際間只有兩大陣營。而歐洲大陸之反蘇聯運動。法蘭西實爲其主動力。波蘭羅馬尼亞等國實附合之以　攻蘇聯。以穩定資本主義之陣地。吾人試仔細考察詳密分析。資本主義國與社會主義國之間。固有不容兩立之點存在。而資本主美各國亦儘多矛盾。民族爭鬥。尤爲現世之特有現像。請以現實證之。法國所最担心最注意者。厥爲其所謂［安全保障。］而［安全保障］之對象非蘇聯乃德意志。其積極經營軍備。欲保持歐洲第一陸軍國地位者。亦以對德多過對蘇即地中海爭覇。法國之假想敵人。亦爲意大利。其東結波蘭·及聯絡巴爾幹半島諸國之眞意。亦以對惫對意爲重。　　莫索里尼之縱横一時。氣蓋南歐。於北非洲爭霸戰。竟至與法國短兵相接血肉相搏矣。德國之欲蹶起復仇開拓市塲恢復故土。已爲不可掩之事實。於法國之深仇宿恨豈易了結。仇法之舉又何止希脫拉一派爲然恐日爾曼民族早已燃起民族之火燄。已法國於此。安敢瞬時忘却耶。是故意德聯結以抗法激　之甚。實超法蘇對立而過之。急進黨上臺之後。對内政策。雖不免有若　干變動對外政策。仍禀其一貫之傳統。而法蘇對立非特漸見緩和其國交且愈趨於接近。十一月二十九日法蘇兩國所簽定之互不侵犯條約即一例。國際關係因此而發生巨大之轉變。三、今後世界之鳥瞰　　法蘇互不侵犯條約之成立在政治上之意義。不僅增進法蘇兩國之國交。而資本主義與蘇聯之間亦將另生一種新關係。以該條約内容觀之。較多邊非戰公約爲具體於尊重雙方領土主權。不使用武力。不圖擾亂。不事干涉以外。對貿易且留特殊餘地。對未來爭議。且特設調解委員會。原文雖祇七條。而對法蘇關係。已有具體之規定。且波蘭亦與蘇聯訂立相似之條約。則是歐洲形勢。非復宿昔之景况。而所謂攻擊蘇聯者。法國爲之領導之說。於是暫告終結。同時吾人就現時情形觀測。</p>
<p>第一法日聯盟恐終難成爲事實。法日固無甚大之利益衝突。亦缺乏眞正聯結之條件戰債問題。美國如能相對讓步。則美法接近之成分。將大過法日聯合。因法蘇互不侵犯條約成立。美蘇復交又將重新提起。　　第二法國旣已與蘇聯親密。丨至少法蘇之間不似從前衝突之甚而德法。法意之間將發生更劇烈之爭競歐洲各國之爭鬥將在另一方面展開。　　第三蘇聯旣無西顧之憂必更着力於自身之建設而法蘭西此後。且以蘇聯爲其未來之市塲。如蘇聯而得法之助力第二次五年計劃。將較第一五年計劃之功績爲大。其收獲成果之後。其東向而爭北滿乎。恐今後遠東之競爭。尤激於戰前之巴爾幹也。</p>

<p>自由談	短篇小說新婚之夜（一）  冰瑩　　（一）　　怎麽辦呢？昨天晚上他們整晚没有　　睡覺，長此下去眞不得了，夫妻是一世的，這樣怎麽行呢？　　蓮大縐着眉，帶着悲苦的聲調向正在揉眼睛的儒老太太說。　　唉！實在她也不小了呀，聽說今年冬天滿十六歲，難道結婚也不知道嗎？從前福嫂子十二歲就圓房（註一），樣樣都懂。　　儒老太太打了一個呵欠，懶洋洋地回答。　　［有些人發育很早，但是像我家的新娘樣，也的確太丢醜了，這樣大聲的哭喊，滿院子的人都聽到了，而况又是靜寂的半夜三更。］　　［自然，只有半夜三更才會發生那樣的事呀，哈哈哈·！］　　老太太不等蓮大姐說完就搶着哈哈哈的大笑起來，使得蓮大姐面紅耳熱，不知要怎樣避開老太太的視綫才好。雖然她曾經做了兩個孩子的母親，但她害羞起來完全像十五六歲的處女一般，羞答答地，美麗而且温和　　［呵，不要笑得太大聲了，恐怕驚醒了他們呢。］　　老太太忽然意識到自已的態度太放肆，忙用手指着隔壁新娘的房說。　　［没有關係，他們這時倒没有聲息，大槪是睡覺了，但是我們的話恐怕被客人聽到了呢·］　　蓮大姐這才抬起頭來，含羞地對着老太太嫣然一笑。　　是陰曆十月的清晨。　　雖然滿院子的鷄聲喔喔地啼個不住，但究竟因爲是雨天，連放牛的六麻子和挑煤炭的一羣小　囉都没有起來，一切都埋葬在沉寂裏，黑霧充滿了　間，從冷風中帶進來一絲絲的微雨。儒老太太忽然打了個寒噤。　　［伯母，你冷吧？再到被窝裏去坐坐好不好？這里火還没有燃呢。］　　蓮大姐忙將開着的半扇窗户關了起來。　　［不要緊·費神，請給我拿那件背心來吧，今天的確有點冷·］　　蓮大姐正要起身去拿背心，忽聽到有急促的脚步聲從窗口下走過，猛然間，碎的一聲，房門開了，這脚步走到了自已的面前。　　［老太太，蓮姑娘　，早呀！］　　［呵，原來是你，我正在懷疑這脚步好像很熟的樣子。］　　［你還聽得出我的脚步，究竟蓮姑娘没有忘記我呢。］　　這走進來的是本院子裏的隣居訓嫂。她的丈夫曾經爲了窮困而去做强盜，被保衛圑砍頭了。她自已因爲守着烈女不事二夫的戒條不願意再嫁，所以她還是一天勞苦一天地在挨着過日子，有人問起她來爲什麽要這樣守活寡，她只是乾脆地回答　　［凡事都是命裏註定的呵，有什麽可說呢？我前世做了恶事，這世應該得到這樣的報應，唉！不修今世修來世，我荆只等待着受完苦進棺材了。］笑　　最近蘇聯有一個奇特運動，即是所謂［笑的總動員］，這好像開玩笑，連不慣笑的我也竟笑了一塲，但因這一笑，就引起了我不少關於笑的感想，姑且說笑說笑，以博大家一笑。　　笑的種類，雖有苦笑，狂笑，媚笑，假笑之分，然人同此心，心同此理，不笑則已，笑必一面自已有甚麽快感，一面也要人發生快感，所以笑是愉快的表現，誰也不容否認。不過太認眞的人，總說於今甚麽都假了，連笑也假了，講得不好聽一點，笑已成了一種商品性質的工具。　　莫說電影明星，舞台坤角，下而至於名花土娼，是公開以笑賣錢，供人享樂，他如靑年男子之於摩登女郎，則由一笑而傾心，失意者之於權貴，亦靠脅肩諂笑來巴結，開店要笑，敎書要笑，承歡上司更難不笑；笑之用廣，笑的墮落便不堪聞同，而人間關係，也就於此瞭然了。　　像現在，一切盡破碎不堪，亂，窮，弱這三個特徵，我國都當得起天字第一號，講到笑，簡直是非其時也，我們實不應說笑，笑則必自討没趣，國亡無日·弄成個欲笑不能的局面下塲。　　不過我們仍不諱言笑，古語說［笑裏藏刀］假使大家鼓着滿腹熱腸，把那献笑，賣笑的頽風扭過來，一齊滿面笑容，添上些朝氣，發揚偉大的民族精神，那倒是笑得其道。當此危機，有的埀頭嘆氣，抑　難安，有的窮奢極樂，流連忘返，這其間縱有笑不笑之别，要皆爲笑的罪人！　　笑說完了，［笑的總動員］，也望能像蘇聯一樣在中國開始！紐約之街  吾　　紐約之街常爲美人所誇耀，眞的，假如我們就其物質文明來說；誰不爲牠驚嘆不已呢？　　因爲馬路兩旁，全是二百尺乃至三百尺的高房子排列着在，於是寛闊的街道，便變成狹長的深谷　了。　　大家知道，紐約的街道貫通南北的稱爲路，横亘東西的謂之街自南至北順數過去，有　一街，二街，三街，··而自東至西順列着的，便　是一馬路，二馬路，三馬路（但其間也偶然挿有以人名或區域名的馬路，如麥迪蓀路與公園路等）。穿過二十條街便　是一哩，八條馬路也是一哩；這樣距離相等的整列着。　　在有名的五馬路中，全是高大的商店；在公園馬路上的，以前多是富豪的住宅，可以說是特權階級的馬路。可是現在却漸次給商店所佔據，富人的住宅，自五十九街以下便不有看見了。五十九街以下現在爲商業區域。而商業區域的五馬路四十二街口，乃爲最繁盛的地帶。　　在四十二街與五馬路交义的地方，有個交通警察在那裏整理交通。警笛吹一聲，便斷絶東西的交通，打開南北的交通，警笛吹兩聲，却正相反。當午後四時與五時之間，我們在那裏可以看得到人羣在警笛的命令之下如潮水一般的湧來，同時被攔住去路的人羣一會兒便是十重二十重的　立着，汽車連綿着幾千百架。波浪似的人羣，長蛇似的汽車！　　據某一警察精確的計算，在十小時中，通過這五馬路四十二街口的人數爲十一萬三千七百八十人，汽車爲八千八百架。平均每二秒鐘有一部汽車，每一秒鐘有三人在這裏通過。最近日本婦女的愛國運動  劍風　　記得從前讀日本敎科書的時候，那裏面有一課叙述一個日本兵士手裏拿着一封信，一面讀，一面埀淚：剛好有一個官佐巡視到了那邊，看見這種情形，不禁憤憤地喝責那個兵士說：你爲什麽像女人一樣在哭着？這個兵士答道　·我因爲被母親的話所感動而哭的，她祈禱我爲國家戰死···，他說完時把那封信呈給那個軍官看。這是一段日俄戰爭當時的故事，現在還傳爲美談，　日本人並且把它編入小學敎科書以灌輸小學生的愛國思想。日俄戰爭距今快將三十年了，日本國威的膨脹比較從前增加了幾十倍，然而一班婦女的愛國熱情却毫不稍减。不信請看下面的事實吧：　　一、婦女圑體的愛國運動　　日本的愛國婦人會因鍳於該國時局的危急，對於全國百五十萬會員下總動員令，開始從事她們的［婦女報國運動］。現將舉行下列的講演：（一）認識時局，（二）貫澈國防精神，（三）闡明國體觀念，（四）喚起自力復甦的精神，（五）家庭經濟的合理化等。　　此外由該會所提携的大日本聯合女子靑年圑，現已與大日本聯合婦人會恊力參加自力復甦的運動。　　二、大日本婦女　國防會　　自今年春間以來，在關西地方有二千多名的女　子加入國防婦人會，這次在東京也有以無名的主婦爲中心，而從事陸京也有以無名的主婦爲中心，而從事陸　軍後援的工作；［大日本國防婦人會］的圑體·已於十月二十四日成立了。發起委員係田村柳子，中村榮　子，三谷秀子···等女史。她們的重大目的是在慰問戰士，援助傷兵軍人的家族和陣亡兵士的遺族的生活，並預備戰時兵士所必需的用品，使一般爲國勤勞的兵士無寒冷之虞。同時金澤市也於十月十三日成立了婦人國防會，早已决議派人赴滿洲僞國慰問出征將士云。　　日本是侵略國，他們現在正在高興地演奏凱旋歌的時候，那班婦女還在不斷地爲國努力。不知道我國的女同胞對此作何感想？她們搓完麻將，看完電影或跳舞之後，也曾念到那些在冰天雪地裏，饖寒交迫而與敵人血戰的義勇軍嗎？冷風寒月  逸名　　去年淹了大水，把甡畜田廬全損失，今年是一個豐年，但依舊是没有飯吃！糓子一點也不値錢，借的本兒從那裏也？對着今宵的冷風寒月，不知道怎樣纔是？這年頭半殖民地的中國，也感着世界的經濟恐慌，紗業幹不過别人，生絲更没有市塲。廣大失業者羣，都抛棄在街頭上徬徨。對着今宵的冷風寒月，思量要去跳黄浦江。長白山成了屍山，黑龍江成了血河。一年來東北人民的日月。在决死抗爭裏度過，儘管是身上没有衣，儘管是肚皮挨着餓，對着今宵的冷風寒月，一齊向敵人開火！黑夜照相的成功  曹仲淵　　照相是利用太陽光線反射的作用。感光成影，道理是很淺顯的。但是太陽光缐不止是我們人類的眼睛所能看見的，也不人類所不能看見的光。人類眼睛所能看見的光帶包括七色，從紅色到紫色爲止，波長從０·７６到０·３９５Microns(0.359Micron=0.00076mm.)所以人類眼睛所能看見的光，以紅色的波長爲最長，棕色次之，黄綠藍靑再次之，紫色爲最短。比紅色更長和比紫色更短的光，都是人類所看不見的。因爲凡是光和熱以至宇宙間的一切，都是一種波動的現象，科學界早已確認的了。　　比較紫色更短並且能夠影響到照相乾片的光。種類很多，愛克司光，就是其中的一種。但是因爲牠有害身體，我們不把牠拿來照相　　比較紅色更長的光，第一就有紅内光ＩnfraredRay這種光有牠特殊的性質和功用，太陽光程燈光裏都包含着牠。我們把燈光封閉在箱裏，不使漏露，箱子的一面用膠木版　(bonite（或呌硬橡皮）或紙拍板(Bakelite)罩住，照相室内黑不見人，於是人目所能看見的光，完全被這箱子隔絶，但是紅内光依舊能夠從膠木或紙拍板發射出來，並且射到目的物後，還會反射·反射到照相片紙，和用太陽光或燈光所拍的同樣留着影子，不道牠不同的地方，是需要長時間的開着鏡頭，這或者是將來普遍應用的一種障礙，但是很値得大家試騐和研究。</p>

<p>長篇創作時代与愛的歧路二張資平　　她雖然笑着很鎭靜地說，但雙臉上也不免微泛了點桃紅［曾伯母，謝謝你，我自已來好了。］　　他一面說，一面又偷看了一下她的側臉。丨丨他眞不敢正視她，因爲她有一種重　，說不出理由來的重壓，抑制着他。初次看見她時，就覺得她是一位可愛的女性，雖不算頂美，但富於一種魅力。至於肌色，他從來没有看見過那樣美的色澤，除非是淡紅色的秋海棠的　片［誰的相片？這樣體面的小姐。］　　海泉正在痴想，忽然聽見鶴子夫人這樣地問他。因爲她從他的被包裏翻出了一張六寸半身的女性的相片。　　［啊，一個親戚的。····］　　海泉不禁臉熱起來。他一邊說，一邊本能地伸手過來搶那張相片。［讓我看一下有什麽要緊呢，林先生！一定有什麽古怪！哈，哈，哈！］她也緊緊地捧着那張像片不放手，一翻身，躲向那頭窗口邊去了。他的手掌眞的只是一瞬間，觸着了她的掌背。他感着一種微微的温感和戰慄。［怎樣的親戚，林先生？］她再笑着問。［eh····］他一時不知要怎樣的回答才好。［一定有什麽古怪！···］她再笑着說。　　其實一點古怪也没有的。海泉在這時倏的確没有適當的名詞來表示這位親戚了。因爲相片裏的女性，是他的姊的妹妹。說是表妹，不妥當吧。［你的未婚妻　？］　　［不是的。我的姊夫的妹妹。····］［那不是恰恰好？互相交換！］海泉想，日本的女性到底和中國的不同，那樣的大方，那樣的活潑，不像中國女子有許多的裝腔作調。　　他房裏的東西大體收拾好了，她忽然態度正經的向着他鞠了一鞠躬。［林先生，攪擾你了。］　　她說了後，便走下二樓去了。（二）海泉坐在黄包車上，再想着今天唐耀星告訴他的話來了。［你住在曾敎授公飽裏，要小心一點。不要給那個東洋婆子勾搭上了。····］［瞎說！］他臉紅起來了。［東洋女子是頂賤的！］［那是你的偏見。］的確海泉自認識了這位東洋師奶後，覺得從前所聴見的毁蔑東洋女人的話，都不可靠了。因爲那個鶴子夫人的態度活潑而不輕佻，雖然喜歡說笑但也雅而不俚，對於他的日常生活，只是像叔母或姊姊那樣懇摰地照拂，並没半點輕薄的舉動。她確是有相當敎養的女性。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言火箭與隱身法  佛　　近據報載，奥國工程師粤美特，近新發明戰塲上之隱身法，行　正式之試騐，其用法將鏡按照一定角度，置於欲］藏匿之兵或櫙之前，此鏡將地上之一部，映現於鏡前，使敵人祇見土地，而不見鏡後之兵砲，又據麥特堡電，德工程師尼培爾，研究火箭，業已多年，今日發表，渠將於明春造成一可以乘坐一人之火箭，届時設能成功，將爲火箭史上空前創舉，開一飛行界新紀錄，　　以上兩種科學的發明，的確是驚人的偉蹟，在科學落後的我國，眞是不能望其項背，即如航空一事，業已由理想而演成事實，由新奇而歸於平淡·完全由於科學的發明，假使科學不進步，即有理想亦是徒然，曾見我國歴史中，有這樣的一段事跡，魏武帝嘗忽發奇想，以爲鳥能飛，人何以不能飛，於是下令徵求人能飛行之法，因此有人編大鳥之羽，繫銅環於腰間，而用手扇之，結果，祇能飛行數武而止，蓋臂力有限，且無久長之力也，此種理想，到底不能實現，現在竟成爲航空世界，無非是科學的效能，　　或說不，［不要長他人的志氣，滅自已的威風，］别種科學或不敢和外國比賽，若說火箭隱身法等等，不是我誇口的話，到也不敢後人，隱身法的名詞。本來發明於我國，不但隱身法，即五逃俱全，亦是不難的事，封神榜，西遊記，征東等書裏，我們可以常常看到，搖身一變，即已不見，即近時而論，義和圑紅槍會，也有槍砲不入的本領，只要唸唸有詞，敵人的炸彈大砲，就無所使其技，至於火箭，更不足道，我國的科學家，不曾數度將飛雷飛箭試騐麽，聞得成績很佳，假令飛雷飛箭可以發明，火箭想亦不是絶對不可能的事，我因看外國科學的突飛猛進，而聯想到我國從前的科學家與現代的科學家，相形之下，不禁啞然，又看到我國一批一批的留學生，戴了政治經濟學法學文學博士碩士等等頭銜，昂然回國，我又不禁倒抽一口冷氣，常識幾種果品的栽培法  芮禹成　　這一篇文章恐怕一次不能寫完，現在僅就最普通三種分述如下；　　（一）梨屬薔薇科植物，我國黄河流域如山東河南産者稱黄梨又名亞兒梨，長江以南産在安徽宣城的呌白梨又稱雪梨，産於河南江以北者名紫梨又呌紫酥梨，産在浙江的則名木梨，梨的效用可以生食，又可爲糖果的原料，及釀酒調味等用。至於栽培的方法分述如下；（一）氣候　；梨性耐寒喜濕，開花時怕風雨；植於北方者宜南向斜地；植於南方的宜北向斜地。（二）土質：以表土乾燥底土濕潤之砂質壤土爲最宜，粘土之輕鬆者亦可。（三）肥料：人糞及堆肥廐肥等均宜。（四）栽培法：梨的繁殖之法，有下種挿樹接樹三種。下種和挿樹二法，專爲接本之用；不然，其果實必定不良。接樹又分芽接切接搭接三種，其中以切接爲普通。接本的種類，也有不用梨本而用棠梨杜棗或石榴的。（五）收穫貯藏：收穫果實，須在天氣晴朗之時；擇其果硬色佳而發香味者以手摘之；若欲輸送遠處或貯藏的，則注意不可使　損傷，且摘時可以略早，摘後須用紙各個包之，藏於箱内，切不可碰傷而致腐敗。（二）蘋果蘋果亦屬薔薇科植物；河北諸省出産最多，品質亦最好，江北産者則相差得遠了。牠的效用，可以生食·亦可製爲乾果或漬於砂糖及釀酒等用。至其栽培方法，分述如下：（一）氣候：蘋果好寒惡暖而喜燥，不適之地所産者絶不佳良：其栽培方位，以東南向及南向者爲最宜，開花後結果時均畏强風。（二）土質：以上層壤土下層砂土者爲最佳，餘如高燥堅實之土圾　質壤土石灰質壤土粘質壤土砂質壤土均可（三）肥料　初生以　　牛馬糞塵芥等爲佳，長成則以人糞尿爲宜。其佳良之肥料，則以塵埃雜草堆積腐敗物及米糠油粕之混合腐熟物加水三倍者爲最好。（四）栽培法：蘋果繁殖之法，分下種壓條挿樹接樹四種；接樹法最通行。所用接本，多用海棠梨。至於接樹的方，則與梨同。（五）收穫貯藏；收穫可於其未十分成熟時以人力次第採摘之，摘後須置於乾燥清凉之地，大約保持四十五度的氣温而行追熟。貯藏之法，和梨相似，唯盛入木箱之後，須塡以乾草或礱糠碎軟之物，以防凍害。　　上述兩種僅最最普通者；尙有橘秭楷杷石榴梅桃杏李棗櫻桃梅葡萄橄欖無花果栗胡桃銀杏荔枝龍眼等，均擬逐一論之。本篇因爲篇幅所限，只得暂告結束；文藝浪淘沙　　（效稼軒體）增育起舞聽晨鐘萬念相攻，人間得失付蒼芎，底事天涯蓬轉日，痛哭途窮，時世造英雄，投筆從戎，沙塲鏖戰血花紅，馬革裹尸壯士志，日貫長虹，如夢令　　（題同學金君小影）俯視羣芳蕪穢，長恨先鳴鷤鴂，踏破軟紅塵，昭質瑩瑩猶在，無怠，無怠，世事多艱吾輩，上操  無畏　　在本刋上見到了惠君的一篇［少爺兵，］不覺想到了去年我們一般也是所謂少爺兵上操底情形，似乎是値得描寫的，也可見到這是學生愛國熱誠的表現？　　九一八的事變，當然與學生一個重大剌激！我們校裏雖不是什麽停課上操；幹着臨事抱佛脚的把戲？但，每天也外加了二小時的軍操，時間底分　配是早上六時半到七時半，下午四到五時，雖然早上對於喜睏　　早的是很不窩心，但爲着國難臨頭，總算每天也硬着心腸從熱　　裏　出来　　在曉霧迷漫冷風撲面的早上，大林路上就可看到少爺兵到體育場上操去了，走讀的是軍衣外罩上棉袍，頭上戴着軍帽；挾着書包（住讀的少一個書包）望去好似賣香港牛肉的？（這是劉敎官常說的，）　　上海三多；少爺多，癟三多，摩登女子多。　　緊急歸馬號吹了後，三連少爺兵早已隊伍排整，各個排長點名完了後，開始操了，於是笑話也來了　　劉敎官一聲［臥到］當然各個是向地上臥去，但同時喧閙聲也隨之發出，　　［喔唷，睏在地上很冷呢！到像在吃冰淇淋？］　　［别閙，要是上面眞的有敵方飛機，那麽不是要全給妰死嗎！］敎官很憤怒的說靜了，這時敎官又發令了，一聲［立起，］各個很迅速的從地上立起，並不依照固定底方法，有的是爬起來，有的撑在人身上立起來，可謂極盡姿態的能事，同時［劈拍！劈拍！］的拍灰塵聲；夾着［我白手套弄髒了？的笑語聲；隨之發出，這使敎官怒極了，又不便打人，祇得很鄙夷地說，　　［這一點乾灰塵都等不到下操後拍去，要是在軍隊裏早就打啦！］於是大家又停也一下，　　單人敎練開始，滑稽事又閙出來了，綽號裴司開登，做慣大少爺的Ｗ；穿了軍服已夠他忸怩，現在被呌出來操；當然更使他不自然開　走竟然左手足一齊向前，博得了一場笑聲；幸虧收操號吹了，爲他解窘，左向敎官行個敬禮後，早又四散回校了，所謂上操又得暫停片刻；等候四時再表演了！返家  還吾　　是一個天涯的游子，爲了父母妻子的衣食，纔流浪　到離開故鄉很遠的地方來，做那汗血換錢的工作。出門已經很久了，他未始不想回家去一趟，安慰他在日夕盼念的父母妻子，但是看到自已身上的這件從出門以來未嘗更換的布袍　，只會使得自已倒抽冷氣。　　想來這是他最得意的時候，已換上了新的布袍，還買了幾樣家中應用的東西，預備回家去一趟了。　　他回家的一路中；在火車中，在帆船中他都這樣想，想把他自已在外邊的工作的辛苦，和受資本家鞭撻的氣忿，都和他父母妻子去透洩一下。這辛苦，這氣忿，除了自已的父母妻子，向誰得去透洩呢！　　回到家裏，雖然父母妻子，都向他强裝着笑容歡迎，但一瞧到孩子的面黄肌瘦，在劈柴的老父，在織布的老母，在紡紗的少妻，都爲他而停止了工作，使他立即會心酸起來，懊悔多此一趟回家來。　　辛苦和氣忿，果然不敢向他父母妻子透洩，先得安慰了父母妻子。不上三天，他甘願再遠離了父母妻　子，含着涙去受工作的辛苦，和資本家的鞭撻。店員通訊緣起與簡則　　本報在這六十週年紀念的時候，對於本埠工商界方面的貢獻，創辦一個流通圖書館，並發行了一種業餘周刋，現在我們感覺本埠社會環境的複雜，尤其是各商店公司中的店員學徒們，爲着業務的關係，與社會接觸的機會更多。在這種情形之下，無論屬社會或個人方面，勢必有許多疑難的問題發生，但個人的智識究屬有限，必集思廣益，始能收互相切磨之效。所以特闢店員通訊一欄歡迎大家提出各種的疑難問題，我們願盡力與大家竭誠討論，希望能得到一個比較妥善而滿意的解决。倘遇有非我們智力所能答覆的題目，當另請專家解釋。　　店員通訊欄簡章　　（一）通訊宗旨本樣集思廣益，解釋疑難問題，相互切磨，增進生活之幸福爲宗旨。　　（二）通訊對象本欄之對象，就人言祇以店員學徒爲限，就地言，祇以本埠爲限。　　（三）通訊内容凡一切關於個人日常生活如；　　（一）職業（二）道德與學問上之修養（三）娛樂與運動（四）婚姻等問題，以及其他旁及國家社會之問題，均所歡迎。如遇問題内容過於深奥而非本欄能力所及者，則亦可介紹至本報［讀者顧問，］代爲解答之。　　（四）來信方式　　（一）信末須寫明姓名，年齡，籍貫，職業及詳細通訊處；繼續來信時須繼續寫明，　（二）來信文體不拘，惟以簡明易解爲主，並須繕寫淸楚。　　（三）信面請寫明申報館本埠增刋店員通訊欄收字樣；如需回信，則請附郵票二分。　　（四）通訊者須將本欄所特刋之印花剪下，黏貼來信之左上角，不貼，恕不作答。　　收集來信後之處理方法　　（一）凡所討論之問題，本報認爲有貢獻大衆之價値者，得在報端披露之。，（二）爲尊重通訊者之意見，凡來信如聲明不願披露姓名，或須單獨答醋復，亦可照辦。　　（三）如通訊者希望將來信披露於報端，而因篇幅過長，不能全文披露時，當擇要刋登。又如問題内容複雜，不得不加以愼重研究，以致遲遲作答或披露時，務希讀者鍳諒。（四）遇有來信擁擠時，當按照來信之先後次第作答或有稽延，亦希鍳諒。申報業餘周刋投稿簡章　　本報自十二月四日起，於每星期日發行業餘周刋一種，投稿簡章如下；　　（一）本刋定名爲業餘周刋，凡屬下列各類稿件槪所歡迎　　（一）業餘生活之改進方法；（娛樂體育·修學等，）　　（二）店員·工友·學徒等，生活自述；（例如本人對於業務上之興趣及意見）　　（三）描寫店員·工友·學徒等生活之文藝　　（四）工商業科學管理法；（五）工商業道德談薈；（六）工商業常識；（七）工商界領袖生活或訪問記；（八）小本生意經營法；（九）其他關於工商界有趣味之小品文字。　　（一）來稿文體不拘，但以明白生動爲宜。（一）來稿須缮寫淸楚，最好用新式標點。（一）來稿發表時署名，由作者自便；但須於稿末註明眞正姓名及詳細住址；并加蓋印章，以便領酬時核對。（一）編者對於來稿有删改權；其不願者，務須預先聲明。　　（一）來稿登載與否，槪不退還；但長篇在二千字以上且預先聲明并附退還郵資者·不在此例。（一）來稿一經登載，其版權即爲本報所有（一）來稿一經登載，報酬從豐；如發覺係剽竊他人之作，或已在别處發表，當即取消其酬金。　　（一）來稿請　寄申報　業　　　　　　華章電刻社　　第一問題徵答預擾答案揭曉智德旣有孝　·必不忍棄父·所以然者·非棄也勢不能也·理由有三一船向對江駛去·父由船頭　下·船身衝壓父身·智德稍知游泳·技術未精·其能力不足從船底救父·二船底覓人·時間必長·　不同歸於盡，幸日得救·父已年老·又痛失孫·不死於水·亦必死於病也·且未知智德有子幾人·設日獨子·後　堪虞·且民爲鄉本·子是家　·爲國家人才計·爲門户宗　計·救子亦未可厚非·三船底救父·不幸三人同死·家有老母·誰慰幕年·是故　負忍名·不爲無益·其行可悲·其心良苦·士君子處身立世·自宜嚴以責已·寛以諒人·　惡揚善·自在我　稱之日智所以勸善也·　　獻梨小事·常人所忽·殊不知父母年老·與世日違·靑年子女·來日方長·何事無再　機會·實不獨一梨已也·眼哭紅腫·此兒性情太傲·想是平日任性所致·五歲雖小·人意漸開·不預分食·以抑其氣·敎子之道不當如此乎·　　智不作無謂犠牲·德能忍一已发　愛·許爲智德·或亦宜焉·　　論曰君子愛人也以德愛其志也上·愛其名也中·愛其身也下·君子謀事也以福·小之福一家·大之福一國·廣之福天下·凡是人也具此志也·智德者·父具此志也·已具此志也·子亦人也此志豈無生哉·父老矣·志存而力盡矣以此勉其子孫而已矣·存其孫者傳其父之志也·愛其父之志也·孝其父之志也·夫人之生也·奉天命而來者也·奉天命而來者傳天之命也·行天之道也·行天之道者濟人也·濟世也·一已一家之事小焉而已矣·聲色之樂·衣食之欲·君子不願也·君子不道也·小子無知天命是忽·爲人父者固當敎之導之也·小子阴知天命是從　·必不敢爭梨也·爭梨者爭利也·利其母者福其母者也·所謂福一家者也·欲福其家者先致其親也·然則親非君子乎·胡爲而必先之也·蓋先我而生者先我而死也·聲色之樂衣食之欲先我而失也·後死者不忍見其不享也故先之·况父母者生我育我爲我而勞者也·亦爲我而

<p>電影專刊影界珍聞嬰孩演員的待遇  紫　　在影戲裏我們不是常常看見嬰孩的客串嗎？不僅是將嬰孩做一個點綴而已，還要將他們的臉部放大在鏡頭上。在攝製這些幕景時，導演者用什麽方法招集合式的嬰孩，和如何計逄那報酬呢？這想必是讀者很願意知道的吧。　　好萊塢的影片公司需要嬰孩角色的時候，最普通的方法，是到落杉磯的敎育局裏去徵求。但一片中所需的小孩，常不祇是一個，因爲所表現的时間不同，小孩的年齡就不能不逐漸增加。因此公司所徵求的小孩常是十餘個，並且要許多不同年齡的。　　有時公司爲了省事，或爲了引起他人興趣起見，也常登報徵求。譬如，不久前狐狸公司徵求一個剛也世的嬰孩，指定要在某一個日子裏，最先出世的嬰孩。於是行將生産的母親們，都努力競爭起來，結果爲一位母親所得。那生産的時刻，是在是日上午一時二十餘分，與她競爭最烈的，不過與她相差幾十秒吧了。像這樣，顯然是含有廣告作用的。　　那末，嬰孩徵求了來之後，他們的薪金如何算法呢？那例來是有一個定價的。一個嬰孩，年齡在三十天内的，每日五金鎊。年齡在三十天與九十天之間的，則十金鎊。在九個月和六個月之間的，也是每日五金鎊。但這裏所說的[每日]，並非是我們平常所謂[整天]的意思。他們攝上二小時，就要算一天了。並且加里福尼亞州的法律中，禁止嬰孩一個時間内，連接的攝到三十餘秒鐘以上，以及每日不許攝過二十分鐘之久。　　並且落杉磯敎育局和衛生局，特地對於工作的嬰孩，有種種週到的設備。年齡在十七天之内的嬰孩，是不應許工作的。並爲了保護工作的嬰孩的衛生起見，他們每天必需受衛生局醫生的檢查，以防疾病傳染。　　在錄取一個嬰孩之後，影片公司還得訂一個合同，表明對於工作的嬰孩，連在工作後的六個月之内，有什麽；在拍戲而發生的三長四短，公司切實負責。這合同是由公司代表，敎育局辦事人，和嬰孩的母親三方面簽字的。美國的工作者，再没有比在影片中露臉的嬰孩，所受的保護　，爲最週全完美了。　　因爲每日二十分鐘和每景三十秒鐘的限制，導演先　生就不得不先　將年紀大的演員完全預備好，才把嬰孩喚來，那時嬰孩的母親們得到通知，早已在家中電話機邊，等候呼喚，立刻可以到塲。因此，在導演先　生的名單中，常是有[十八個嬰孩靜候吩咐]等字樣了。　　就是單是這樣等候着，嬰孩的母親們也可以得到二金鎊一天呢。小片評[奮鬥]中兩點細巧的穿插  青君　　穿挿靑君　　聯華新片[奮鬥]的價値，今天報紙上已有許多好評，當然用不着在下來挿嘴。但是在下覺的片中有兩段很細七的穿挿，也許觀衆易於忽略，故此敢提出來說一說。至於是否如在下設想的，仍請列位一同商榷。　　小鄭同燕姑訂婚後，初次錫予燕姑美麗可愛的小鳥]，燕姑也報以[偉大勇猛的老虎]時，一壁拿起手中所執的摺扇，輕輕地在小鄭額上劃了一個[王]字，這是很有趣味的。但爲時甚暫，並且没有什麽痕迹，是願觀者細心的領會。　　游戲塲中四魔這一段，許多人多認爲是很有意味的穿挿，但在下以爲穿挿之中更有穿挿。即是小鄭投擲四魔，三者都應聲而倒，惟有［病魔］屢擲不中。這正是影射着燕姑後來的一塲大病，表示英雄雖剛，但自已爲國宣勢時，也無法袪去愛人的病。　　照在下所見到的，片中也有一處失點。就是小袁反惡爲正，爲國犠牲，在觀衆也對他表示最後的同情了；那末想來劉先生當然是該對小鄭問題他，或者小鄭當以此報告於劉先　生。然而片中並没提起這點。編劇先生，你亦以此說爲然否？（稿酬移助義軍）風月今宵前奏曲  華　　風月今宵SousLesToitsDeParis是一齣美好的法國愛情片，故事曲折而有趣味。寫一個小家碧玉波拉小姐，如何遇着歌唱家亞爾培，如何受着惡覇佛雷得的欺侮，如何和亞爾培友人路易士相愛，把一個初人情塲小妮子的心理，曲曲傳　出。女主角波拉綺麗蓮，在表演上，已達到極大的成功。導演手腕，極其精細，和劉别謙有異曲同工之妙。鏡頭亦靈活非凡。最低限度，是値得電影從業者的一看。此劇於今日起在巴黎大戲院公映。本埠銀屑王螢與DreamLover  森　　Dreamlover這一首歌，在現在中國的大都市裏，眞通行極了，好比前幾年的毛毛雨。在公園裏，電車上，林蔭路上，常常聽到有些靑年男女唱這曲歌。但這曲歌同螢女士的友好尤其比一般人　深，親切。她是把這曲歌比作自已的愛人（雖然她那時有個愛人），走路，作工，遊玩，常常的，不知不覺的她就唱出口。她一唱，委屈宛轉，把所有歌中眞味都表現出來。只消她的聲音能再高大些，那敢保可以比上麥唐納了。　　特别是在吳淞海邊中國公學的三層樓宿舍裏，一座面南房子，看出去是一片江水，她也許因此心胸曠達，天天唱這曲Dreamlover的歌曲。她那美妙幽默的歌聲，由海風飄散到各處，許多人都爲它傾心了，沉醉了·····　　［歌王。］她享有這樣的聲名，雅號。不幸的日本帝國主義大砲燬了中國公學，她的Dreamlover一曲歌聲，再也不在海濱一帶飄散了。　　王螢是誰？據說她是新由天一轉入明星的一顆女星。龔秋霞之我聞  銀光　　質之靑霞君以爲如何？　　年來歌舞明星相繼入電影界者，頗不乏人，如王人美，黎莉莉。薛玲　仙。等皆然現聞曾以主演［楊貴妃］［後台］等劇，獲得社會人士　美之龔秋霞女士，已應明星之請，主演一有聲片，名［愛伴］。記者昨見本刋［龔秋霞小史］一文，其中有數點，實係誤傳。　　龔女士從未加入葡萄歌舞圑，已亡之伍佩嫻氏，乃一女性，與龔女士係同性至友，發生愛情之說，甚爲滑稽。　　彼之未婚夫名胡心靈，非吳醒靈。胡君回國後卽與乃父及閔翠英父女創辦新東方劇塲，當初曾　動一時。　　現雖聞龔女士加入明星，然外界双傳說龔秋霞，與胡心靈君自開影片公司。聞尙有政府某要人及著名文藝家數人合作進行，閔翠英女士等亦將加入云。一位當鑪的文君  猛虎　　克萊拉　（ClaraBow）她曾開設過一酒館，但是不幸完全失敗了。現在她買下一個洗衣公司，由她父親去管理，但比起第一件事業來，也并不見得怎樣的有利。</p>

<p>閱者意見方便之門可開否？  燦爛　　世界上的事，無論什麽，　有利必有弊，而有弊也未嘗不可有利。外國片子在中國開映，對於英文程度欠缺的人，當然很困難。所以常常在銀幕左端放一塊白布，另映中文字幕，到現在，除七家大影戲院不肯試用外，别家差不多都用了。可是這樣一來，塲内添了不少光線，銀幕上反而模糊了。　　不過還有一利在，就是臨時找人的方便。在平津京蘇各埠如果兩個人約好在戲院聚會等第二個人到時，影片已開映，不容易找到他朋友，於是打一塊玻璃版寫［××君·門外××找］（有收手續費的，有不收的）於是兩個人就不至你我空等了。在上海，這方法是不通行的，我僅以影迷的地位，希望各家能採用。　　還有兩點，也是中國内地通行而上海没有的。在入門處的留言牌。上面寫了些：［×！我在樓上第×排］或［×！我來遲票已售完，所以下塲再來］等等。還有就是存票，例如一個人先去買了票，自已進塲時，在餘票上寫了取票人姓名，存在［存票處，］或收票員手中，後來的人一說姓名，就可取之入塲。省得先　去的一人，又得持票在外等。　　以上三點雖然辦法很幼稚，但却能給觀衆多少便利。　　編者附註：編者亦是平津老白相，所以對於燦爛君所提議的種種方便之處，亦都經歷過。我覺得這許多種方便，都是方便一二人，却妨礙了大家。第一種映字幕尋人，擾亂觀衆的視聽，跑進跑出，驚擾旁座的人。還有许眵惡少之輩，借此替自已名字登廣告，出風頭，我在天津的時候，對於這種行動，深惡痛恨，當然不希望上海，起而效尤。至於留言牌上，胡塗亂寫，有礙影院的觀瞻，且多有許多藏垢納汚的可能。至於存票處，亦多一糾紛的製造所，常有冒領衝突之事發生。我看觀衆們到影戲院，還是按時早些携手同去的好。不敏影片談評講講［婚後］  燕南　　蘭心換的新片［婚後］，原名是Arentoeall。中西片名，毫無關係，但是顧名思義，牠是一張家庭愛情片。　　雖然是派拉蒙出品，但是在英國分廠攝的；少不得帶些［歐化·］即如對白太多·永久是歐化的缺憾。　　内容只是說：一個家庭，父親是脂粉隊中的能手，整日花天酒地。於是他的兒子，不能不捨了新［婚後］的蜜月，而代替父親工作；甚至替他父親來交際。不過因爲他和他父親女友的來往，而使他新婚的妻生疑。那時另一男子，乘機求愛于他妻子，於是一雙情侶，幾陷破裂。後來還是作父親的，從中週旋，於是新婚後的夫婦，纔能言歸于好。　　飾父親的HughWakefield，老成中還帶了一部份詼諧，很能稱職的作一個未忘靑春的老叟：丨同時又是慈父。丨飾兒子的OwenNares，不過是一個平淡的忠厚少年，没什麽精彩表演。GertrudoLaorenco扮他的妻子，却是作得很好，　中人的　性的確可以代表世界上大多數的少婦。另一追求她的男子，是HaroldHuth作的，風流少年，很像一位翩翩佳公子。硬呌他算反派角色，我有些替他呌屈。其餘的配角，還都能差强人意。　　當然這女主角勞倫絲，是片中表演最好的；（但是她並不是最重的角色），她的沉靜幽嫻中，帶了異性的［熱］，以及唱的三隻曲子，都和瑪琳迪脫許，哊異曲同工之妙。　　一切内景外景，都含有充份的［美術意味］。未來派的佈景；特别在舞塲中，極奢侈華麗之能事，可以算片中很精彩的地方。舞塲一段，足有全片的三分之一，比較上也是最給人興奮的！　　這劇中，穿挿很少，平述本事，所顯示給我們的，只是倫理關係而已。不過無論如何，牠到底仍是英國片子中的上選。隨便談談中國女星小評  虞淸華　　中國電影現在到復興的時期了，一半固然因爲舶來的有聲電影，使一般聽不懂對白的觀衆，趨向國産電影，一半却因電影界産生了幾位天才的女星，使國産片本身的價値提高不少，這幾位女星，對於電影界的功績，是不可埋没的，現在把牠們的個性作風，作一小評，以博　女星］笑。　　陳燕燕　　悲角的天才來了！有濃的眉，大的眼，眼光中自然會露出悽怨的神彩，她也飾童角及被壓迫者，可使你表示十二分的同情，如果你硬要她笑一笑，那麽恰巧和阮玲玉成一個反比例，她的笑會變成苦笑的。　　黎灼灼　　以演人道一片而成名的黎灼灼，她的作風完全和克萊　一樣，她有靑春的熱力，有最活潑身段，十足的一位摩登女性的典型，現在我們可以不必崇拜克萊拉　了，因我們中國自已亦有熱女郎啊！</p>

<p>Decides to Convene Special Assembly Next Tuesday; China's Request for Expedited Resolution Timeline Rejected; De Valera Predicts Assembly Will Form Mediation Committee. (Geneva) The Nineteen-Nation Special Committee met this morning and formally decided to convene a special session of the League of Nations General Assembly next Tuesday (the 6th). It also responded to the request submitted by China's Chief Delegate Yan Huiqing on November 29th, stating that the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee would consider solutions and determine a timeline for the League of Nations to resolve the case only after the League of Nations General Assembly reviews the Lytton Report. (Central News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese representative Matsuoka met with the Chairman of the Nineteen-Nation Committee, Belgian representative Hymans, for a long time this morning, strongly arguing that Japan opposes the committee drafting a resolution at this time. Hymans subsequently met with League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond and then declared that he would return to Brussels tonight. (National News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>Chairman of the League of Nations Council, Éamon de Valera, returned from Geneva and arrived here today. He expressed his opinion on the Sino-Japanese issue, saying that if the member states of the League of Nations earnestly demonstrate their determination to uphold the principles of the League of Nations Covenant and the Treaty of Peace and Non-Aggression, a solution to the dispute will not be difficult to achieve. All who carefully read the Lytton Report and acknowledge the facts it describes can know the way to resolve it: Under the supervision of the League of Nations, the legitimate interests of both parties can be protected until the people of the three northeastern provinces can decide for themselves what kind of close political relationship they wish to have with China. De Valera predicted that the proceedings in Geneva would proceed as follows: The League of Nations General Assembly will consider the Lytton Report, return it to the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee to draft a resolution and report, and then hold a plenary session of the League of Nations General Assembly again. The result of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee's report will likely be the establishment of a mediation committee. Each stage of this process may be completed around December 20th. De Valera does not wish to return to Geneva and will likely send the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs of the Irish Free State, Connolly, as his representative. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Results of Yesterday's Meeting <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Discussion Lasted Only Forty-Five Minutes; Resolved to Convene Special Assembly (Geneva) The Nineteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations convened at 11:10 AM this morning in the Council Chamber, beginning preparations for convening a special session of the League of Nations General Assembly. Initially, it was a closed-door meeting, which was opened to the public and the press after ten minutes. Chairman Hymans declared the opening of the public meeting at 11:20 AM among the nineteen-nation committee members seated around the conference table.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Decision to Convene Special Assembly <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Hymans then announced that the League of Nations General Assembly had been convened for a special session, scheduled to open next Tuesday, and explained the reason why this move was not formally approved by the Nineteen-Nation Committee first. He stated that the Sino-Japanese dispute had been submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly by the resolution of February 19th, so there was no need for further consultation at this time. Chairman of the Council, De Valera, had stated that within the League of Nations General Assembly, all members would be given a full opportunity to speak, and he believed that everyone would agree with him that it was necessary for the League of Nations General Assembly to convene a special session, hoping that the members would not object to this move. After the chairman's explanation, with no one speaking, he declared that the convening of a special session of the League of Nations General Assembly had been formally approved.</p>

<p>Hymans then paused the proceedings briefly to jointly welcome the attendance of the new member, Turkey. Turkish representative Faysal responded, hoping that the committee's actions would strengthen the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Yan Huiqing Demands Swift Resolution <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Then, Hymans read the letter from Chinese representative Yan Huiqing dated November 29th, questioning when the extension of the original six-month deadline for resolving the dispute, which had been passed by the previous Council meeting, would end. The letter concluded by stating that Chinese patriots were still fighting the Japanese in Manchuria in an attempt to break free from illegal foreign rule. This act of aggression continues to cause suffering to the Chinese people of Manchuria and should be stopped as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Hymans then explained in detail the reasons for extending the original six-month deadline, providing many legal points. He stated that if the Nineteen-Nation Committee agreed, he would notify Dr. Yan that the time limit for the extension could not be set before the League of Nations General Assembly began its discussions. Hymans then said that he thought the League of Nations General Assembly should study the Lytton Report and the opinions of China and Japan before the Nineteen-Nation Committee discussed them. Czech Foreign Minister Beneš agreed with Hymans's proposal, but requested the committee to set a deadline for convening a meeting of the committee as soon as possible after the General Assembly opens, in a definite tone.</p>
<h3 id="e7">China's Request is Rejected <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Chinese representative Yan Huiqing had submitted a written request that the committee should immediately draft a resolution and resubmit it to the General Assembly, but this was ultimately rejected by the committee.</p>
<p>Hymans then briefly described the division of labor and cooperation between the Nineteen-Nation Committee and the General Assembly, saying that the General Assembly would first discuss the Lytton Report. After all the member states participating in the debate had expressed their opinions, the Nineteen-Nation Committee would reconvene to agree on a final resolution timeline and send it to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Swiss representative Motta asked the meeting to do its best to avoid delays, saying that setting such a bad example would have serious consequences, and stated that he agreed with the Council's decision not to discuss the Lytton Report, saying that the League of Nations General Assembly was more suitable for discussing the report of the international investigation team.</p>
<p>British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden stated his support for Hymans's proposal, saying that no matter what the Nineteen-Nation Committee intended, we cannot set a deadline for the extension at this time. We must wait for the General Assembly to discuss it before we can decide. The matter is very clear, because this case is very important, we must wait a little longer.</p>
<p>Irish representative Connolly then asked whether, after the Nineteen-Nation Committee decided on the final resolution timeline, the League of Nations General Assembly needed to convene a meeting to pass the timeline set by the committee, and asked the meeting to do its best to reduce delays, saying that if the set timeline had to be passed by the League of Nations General Assembly, the process would inevitably be delayed. Hymans replied that he could not agree with Connolly's statement that this procedure would increase delays, and said that he would be happy to see everyone again at the General Assembly on Tuesday, and then formally announced the adjournment of the meeting at 11:55 AM.

<p>(Tokyo) According to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Chairman Hymans will resign as chairman and return home after attending today's meeting of the Nineteen-Nation Committee. The reason is that, as a result of the general election, Hymans fears that he will not be able to retain his position as Foreign Minister. Hymans will return home to consult with Japanese representative Matsuoka. (China United Press, 1st)</p>

<p>Public Meeting Lasts Only Three Days; Japanese Representatives Actively Campaign (Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry received a report from its delegation in Geneva stating that the order of the special session of the League of Nations on December 6th will be to first invite representatives from China and Japan to speak, then invite smaller countries to express their opinions, and then hand it over to the committee for review. This procedure can be said to adopt Japan's request. According to the Japanese representative, the General Assembly originally tried to avoid a public decision, asking the General Assembly to form a special committee to review the Lytton Report, attempting to delay the General Assembly and muddle things up. The Japanese Foreign Ministry believes that the League of Nations is powerless to sanction it and has decided to accommodate Japan. (China United Press, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry heard that the British and French Prime Ministers will personally attend the General Assembly and ordered Matsuoka Yosuke to liaise exclusively with the two Prime Ministers, and dispatched League of Nations Vice-Minister Sugimura and Ito to share the task of manipulating the League of Nations and wooing the smaller countries. Yesterday, they started working separately. (China United Press, 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The provisional General Assembly of the League of Nations will open on the 6th. The main countries participating in the General Assembly reached an internal agreement yesterday to not put forward any resolutions on non-recognition of [Manchukuo] at the General Assembly before entrusting the Sino-Japanese dispute to the Nineteen-Nation Committee. This is because if major powers such as Britain, France, and Italy participate in the smaller countries' resolutions on non-recognition of [Manchukuo], it would harm the coordinated efforts of the League of Nations General Assembly. (Dentsu, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry has received a telegram from Chairman Hymans officially inviting it to open a provisional General Assembly and yesterday telegraphed Director Sawada, instructing him to notify the Japanese representatives. The attendees will be Chief Representative Matsuoka Yosuke, Nagaoka Haruichi, and Sato Naotake. Representative Matsuoka will be solely responsible for the discussion, and Representative Sato is also scheduled to take the stage and speak. (Dentsu, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A telegram from Geneva states that the provisional General Assembly will hold public meetings for three days starting on December 6th, and then transfer the Sino-Japanese issue to the Nineteen-Nation Committee. Therefore, the three-day General Assembly is in fact no different from a speech meeting, and no development can be expected. The outcome seems to be a solution explored by a basic committee composed of five or six national representatives. It is impossible to predict whether this solution can be established within this year. According to reports, the League of Nations authorities' views on this mediation committee are as follows: (1) The mediation committee does not have the function of a third party to adjudicate disputes between the parties concerned. Only after the participation of the two parties, China and Japan, will it study mediation procedures in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Charter. (2) It is not without benefit to Japan if the meeting place is in London. (Japan Federation News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the League of Nations General Assembly to be held on the 6th of this month, the speeches of the representatives of countries other than China and Japan can be completed by the 6th, 7th, or at the latest the 8th. It is planned to transfer the issue to the Nine-Nation Continuation Committee. After general discussions are completed, before entrusting the committee, resolutions such as non-recognition of Manchukuo will not be proposed. An understanding has been reached among the countries participating in the General Assembly, so the Nineteen-Nation Committee on the first day is only a formality, and the focus of interest will be on the Nineteen-Nation Committee after the general discussion of the General Assembly. However, with Christmas just around the corner, the committee will not be able to continue its deliberations until after December 17th. According to observers, the result may have to be postponed until next year. Also, the General Assembly Hall will be used for disarmament proceedings. (Dentsu, 1st)</p>

<p>Japan Uses Pseudo-State's Participation as Exchange (Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that Japan strongly opposes the proposal to form a mediation committee composed of the Nineteen-Nation Special Committee and representatives of the United States and Russia to resolve the Manchurian dispute. This approach is the same as when the great powers discussed the Shandong issue in Washington in 1921 and forced a solution on Japan. Japan cannot agree. If the Manchurian issue is discussed by a mediation committee, then Japan, [Manchukuo], and China must all participate. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Matsuoka's Memorandum Again <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Does He Want to Cover Up the Eyes and Ears of the World? (Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations distributed a memorandum from Japanese representative Matsuoka to the directors of the Council, which refuted the points raised by Chinese representative Gu Weijun on November 20th. Gu mentioned the various obstacles encountered during the Lytton Investigation Team's investigation in the three northeastern provinces. Matsuoka's memorandum stated that the reason why Dr. Gu was not welcomed was that the [Manchukuo] government opposed his entry, and the Japanese government not only urged [Manchukuo] to allow Gu to enter, but also provided him with life protection when Gu was in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Matsuoka's memorandum discussed the situation in China, stating that the Japanese have not seen any indication that the internal chaos in China can be stopped in many years. However, Japan has never abandoned the hope of seeing China's unification. Unfortunately, Japan cannot share the Lytton Investigation Team's hope that China can stabilize soon. As for the accusations that Japan has repeatedly tried to obstruct China's unification work, there is no basis for them. In the past twenty years of China's civil wars, there has not been a single ambitious military man who did not welcome the assistance of Japanese arms and money. President Sun Yat-sen himself also sought help from Japan. Sun took refuge in Japan, but failed to obtain assistance from Japan to carry out his revolutionary plans, as he did from Russia. The Japanese want the cessation of the Chinese revolution, not its continuation. The Japanese still want it to end now.</p>
<p>Dr. Gu mentioned that Yuan Shikai's unification of China failed due to Japanese manipulation. Matsuoka's memorandum refuted this, saying that President Yuan Shikai's overthrow was entirely due to the opposition of the Chinese people, and the most forceful opposition was from President Sun Yat-sen. In August 1927, the Japanese army's dispatch to Jinan to protect Japanese residents did not hinder Chiang Kai-shek's National Revolutionary Army's northward advance. The activities of the Wuhan Communist government destroyed Chiang Kai-shek's plan. In the Tanaka Memorial of May 18, 1928, Japan reluctantly stated that it would take appropriate measures to maintain security and order in the three eastern provinces. Tanaka made this declaration because the Chinese army was in danger of disturbing the three eastern provinces after the war in the Tianjin area.</p>
<p>Matsuoka's memorandum mentioned the Zhang Zuolin incident, saying that eliminating Old Zhang was not in Japan's interest. The Japanese government was shocked and disappointed when it heard of his death. To say that Japan views a unified China as a blow to its expansion policy and dream of conquering the world is absurd. Japan deeply worries about the development of a new China and its future direction. This worry is a key point in the issue, and the Japanese are very regretful about it, just as the Chinese representative welcomes it. The Japanese regret that China is now moving towards lawlessness, not towards order. China's failure to abide by treaties is the cause of disputes and difficulties between China and foreign countries. China has various obligations under the various resolutions passed at the Washington Conference, but it has not yet fulfilled them. There is also no guarantee whether the National Government can and is willing to fulfill any promises made by the Chinese representative. To maintain the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant, it is important that the signatory countries do not implement xenophobic policies. China had previously promised to take full measures to eliminate the adverse effects of the fabricated Chinese documents spreading abroad, but despite this promise, the Chinese representative openly disseminated them and used them in the Council.</p>
<p>Matsuoka's memorandum continued to mention the boycott issue, saying that when foreign countries take emergency measures due to the turbulent situation in China, China always responds with a boycott. Therefore, China's anti-Japanese movement is not a retaliatory act against Japan's military plans. Matsuoka's memorandum stated that the relationship between the Kuomintang and the National Government is the same as the relationship between the Communist International and the Soviet Russian government. The memorandum also cited cases of insecurity for foreigners and missionaries in China. The memorandum denied the claim by foreign officials that China showed no signs of xenophobia. The memorandum's mention of the [Manchukuo] government taking over the Salt Inspectorate, customs, post office, telecommunications bureau, road and mining institutions, and confiscating certain taxes stated that this was a natural result after the establishment of [Manchukuo] and was entirely within the scope of the new government.</p>
<p>The memorandum concluded by mentioning the Shanghai Incident, saying that the resistance of the Chinese soldiers was unexpected. The Japanese soldiers were outnumbered and felt especially difficult because they had to fight in the streets to deal with the houses occupied by the Chinese soldiers. The Japanese army had to defeat the Nineteenth Route Army and did defeat it. However, Chinese-Russian-style propaganda confused the facts. In fact, the Japanese army's rapid and complete withdrawal from the area near Shanghai was sufficient to fully demonstrate Japan's will. The loss of life and property of the Chinese and Japanese people is certainly regrettable, but the lives of Chinese civilians who are now often killed by Chinese soldiers are even more numerous. Millions of civilians in various provinces have lost their lives, and countless cities and towns have been looted by the National Revolutionary Army, the Communist Army, and other troops. Those who are fortunate enough to be safe are the treaty ports protected by foreigners, where Chinese merchants and bankers gather, and even Chinese officials take refuge. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After Japan increased its troops to northern Manchuria and attacked Su Bingwen and Ma Zhanshan's troops, the Japanese army in Fularji, gathering more than 20,000 troops, took advantage of the extreme cold to launch a rapid attack. Su, seeing through the enemy's intentions, adopted a guerrilla warfare strategy, attacking the Japanese army anytime and anywhere. From Fularji to the west to Zhalantun, three strong defensive fortifications were built, making it extremely difficult for the enemy to advance. Reports of a major battle about to begin are Japanese propaganda. Major battles will not be easy to see in the future. The morale of the people in the rear is high, and they are organizing a people's reserve army. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) As a result of the meeting between Su Bingwen and Ma Zhanshan in Zhalantun, they will advance in three routes. Pu Bingshan will command the central route, Ma Zhanshan will command the eastern route, and Su Bingwen will command the western route. The routes will advance according to the planned plan. Zhang Dianjiu, the deputy commander of the western route, and Zhang Yuting, the commander of the forward troops, are stationed on the Zhalantun front line. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Su Bingwen telegraphed on the 29th that morale was very high. Japanese air force planes recently bombed along the railway line, killing and injuring innocent residents. He has telegraphed Geneva to announce and expose the atrocities. (News, 1st) (Beiping) Su Bingwen has released more than 300 Japanese women and children previously detained and sent them back to their country. There are currently more than 200 people detained in Hailar. After Matsuki's division arrived in Longjiang last month, it sent five planes to Hailar, preparing to bomb. Su pushed the Japanese nationals out and tied them to various places near the military headquarters. The Japanese planes received the news en route and, after arriving in Hailar, did not drop bombs because they saw many Japanese consuls and military attachés among the Japanese nationals and flew back. Recently, Japanese planes have only bombed stations close to the front line. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>Zhang Zian and Sun Liansheng China East News Agency reports that, according to the Shanghai Liaison Office of the Northeast National Salvation Army Command Headquarters, Zhang Zian, the commander of the first and second detachments of the Northeast National Salvation Army, died in action in Liuxishisantun. The details are as follows: The second detachment was originally stationed in Heishan County and fought in Xiaobaiqibao on November 14. Due to lack of support, it retreated to its original defense. On the 19th, it engaged the enemy in Buyiliwobao for several hours and captured a medium machine gun. On the 23rd, it encountered the enemy in Heishan. Zhang and Battalion Commander Zhang Yutian and Company Commander Sun Liansheng immediately led their troops to meet the enemy. The enemy used heavy artillery, we used infantry artillery, they used materials, and we used spirit, charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat, killing dozens of enemies. In the end, they were outnumbered and surrounded in Liuxishisantun. With 1,000 isolated troops against 3,000 enemies, they fought fiercely for two days and nights, killing more than 70 people and losing two machine guns and more than 30 rifles, while the enemy also killed 24 Japanese soldiers and 16 pseudo-police officers. Zhang Zian and Sun Liansheng still fearlessly took the lead in commanding and were killed by artillery fire, dying for their country. The surviving troops have now returned to their original defense, and Yuan Yuheng has been appointed as the acting detachment commander and is now engaged in reorganization, preparing to rise again. Zhang Zian was a native of Xinmin County, Liaoning. He served in the police and military of the Northeast, was loyal and hardworking. After the September 18th Incident, he engaged in anti-Japanese work and served as the commander of the second detachment of the first route of the Northeast National Salvation Army, under Jin Ziming, and repeatedly made outstanding achievements. He was only 24 years old this year and has a mother in her 60s, a weak wife, and young children. He is extremely desolate after his death.</p>

The staff personally led 200 guards as the support team and advanced to Qiansuo to inspect the situation, arriving near Qiansuo Station at 12:00 AM that night. After a short rest, Deng ordered the advance. The enemy had about 380 soldiers, and the defensive fortifications were very strong. There were blockhouses built on the east and west streets, and the perimeter of the city was covered with iron nets. The first team was ordered to cut through the iron nets and attack the trenches, while the third team was assigned to destroy the railway and station. The entire first battalion was ordered to surround the Daishi Bridge, three miles west of the railway station, and prevent the enemy from coming to the west to cut off our rear. With preparations complete, the attack was launched simultaneously. The enemy responded hastily, engaged in hand-to-hand combat for three hours, and defeated the Japanese bandits. At about 4:00, the station was completely occupied. The enemy retreated south of the railway. In this battle, more than 40 enemies were killed, 34 Type 38 rifles and one machine gun were seized, and many military supplies were seized. Our army suffered nine casualties and consumed 3,000 rounds of 6.5mm bullets, 5,000 rounds of 7.9mm bullets, and more than 170 hand grenades. It is now planned to attack Koukou.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<p>After the Conclusion of the Franco-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty Again Xuan Yi, the essence of the Soviet Union is that the Russian imperial regime collapsed and the revolution succeeded. This was an unprecedented major change in Russian history, and general understanding also changed accordingly. We recall that at the end of the European War, when the world first discovered the socialist Soviet regime, the capitalist countries tried to interfere with the growth of Soviet Russia. And Soviet Russia also wanted to kick over capitalism in one fell swoop. During this period of intervention, Soviet Russia tried its best to launch the so-called world revolution. However, the socialist Soviet Union did not collapse due to the intervention of various countries, and the capitalist society did not collapse due to the large-scale propaganda of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Since the Great War, capitalist countries have been vigilant about their own crises and busy with internal reorganization. The so-called policy of intervention in the Soviet Union has long become a thing of the past. What still exists now is a kind of propaganda effect. The Soviet Union has carefully realized that the establishment of capitalism is by no means accidental. Its collapse cannot be achieved by temporary anger. Therefore, the implementation of the New Economic Policy and the Five-Year Plan all focus on domestic construction and have long abandoned the active policy of overthrowing capitalism. Even due to the backwardness of Russian society, it even uses capitalist methods and hires specialized talents from various countries to build the Soviet Union. Although it is called socialism, it is actually concentrating capital in the state. And the so-called [Red Propaganda] is, when its content is dissected, nothing more than a means of resistance by the Soviet Union against the intervention of capitalist countries. In other words, it is a disguised method of self-defense. Since the intervention of various countries in the Soviet Union has stopped and general diplomacy has gradually resumed, the arrogance of [Red] propaganda has also declined. The rift between the Soviet Union and various countries has gradually healed. Although the political systems and institutions are different, the conflict between countries is not as intense as previously imagined. When Lenin was alive, he said, [We don't want to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, but we don't want others to interfere in ours...] His intention of self-respect is overflowing with words. The Soviet Union is determined not to give an inch of its land to others, nor does it want to invade an inch of other people's land. Therefore, it advocates a policy of peace and first signs non-aggression treaties with neighboring countries on the western front, such as Turkey, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Afghanistan, and Germany. Except for Germany, which has special relations, other major countries still have only ordinary diplomatic relations. 2. The tremendous changes in international relations The current world's international relations. From the perspective of the general eye, it is believed that there are only two major camps in the international community. And France is the main driving force behind the anti-Soviet movement in Continental Europe. Poland, Romania and other countries are attached to it to attack the Soviet Union in order to stabilize the position of capitalism. If we carefully examine and analyze in detail, there are indeed irreconcilable points between capitalist and socialist countries, but capitalist countries also have many contradictions and ethnic struggles, which are particularly unique phenomena in the present world. Please prove it with reality. What France is most worried about and pays attention to is its so-called [security guarantee.] And the target of [security guarantee] is not the Soviet Union but Germany. Its active efforts to operate military preparations in order to maintain its position as the number one army in Europe are also more focused on Germany than on the Soviet Union. In the Mediterranean hegemony, France's hypothetical enemy is also Italy. Its true intention of allying with Poland and connecting the countries of the Balkan Peninsula is also focused on dealing with Germany and Italy. Mussolini's temporary recklessness covered Southern Europe. In the battle for hegemony in North Africa, it even came to the point where it fought hand-to-hand with France. Germany's desire to rise up, take revenge, open up markets and restore its homeland is an undeniable fact. How can the deep hatred for France be easily resolved? The act of hating France is not limited to Hitler's faction, and it is feared that the German nation has already ignited the flames of nationalism. How dare France forget this for a moment? Therefore, the collusion between Germany and Italy to confront and irritate France actually exceeds the opposition between France and the Soviet Union. After the Radical Party came to power, although its domestic policy inevitably had some changes, its foreign policy still followed its consistent tradition. The opposition between France and the Soviet Union not only gradually eased, but their diplomatic relations became closer and closer. The non-aggression treaty signed by France and the Soviet Union on November 29 is an example. As a result, tremendous changes have taken place in international relations. 3. A bird's-eye view of the world in the future The conclusion of the Franco-Soviet non-aggression treaty has political significance that not only promotes diplomatic relations between France and the Soviet Union, but also creates a new relationship between capitalism and the Soviet Union. Judging from the content of the treaty, it is more concrete than the multilateral non-war treaty. In addition to respecting each other's territorial sovereignty, not using force, not attempting to disturb, and not interfering, it also leaves special room for trade and sets up a special conciliation committee for future disputes. Although the original text has only seven articles, it already has specific provisions for Franco-Soviet relations. Moreover, Poland has also signed a similar treaty with the Soviet Union. This means that the situation in Europe is no longer what it used to be. And the saying that France is leading the attack on the Soviet Union has come to an end for the time being. At the same time, we observe from the current situation.</p>
<p>First, the Franco-Japanese alliance is feared to be difficult to become a reality. France and Japan have no major conflicts of interest and lack the conditions for a real alliance. If the United States can make a relative concession on the war debt issue, then the component of US-French rapprochement will outweigh the Franco-Japanese union. Because of the conclusion of the Franco-Soviet non-aggression treaty, the restoration of US-Soviet diplomatic relations will be brought up again. Second, since France has become close to the Soviet Union, at least the conflict between France and the Soviet Union is not as intense as before, and more intense competition will occur between Germany and France, and between France and Italy. The struggle among European countries will unfold in another aspect. Third, since the Soviet Union has no worries about the west, it will certainly devote more effort to its own construction, and France will also regard the Soviet Union as its future market. If the Soviet Union obtains the help of France, the second five-year plan will be more successful than the first five-year plan. After reaping the results, will it turn eastward and compete for northern Manchuria? It is feared that the competition in the Far East in the future will be even more intense than the Balkans before the war.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Central National Government Holds Ceremony for Return to Beijing <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Lin and his entourage went to Pukou on a special train on the morning of the 1st to pay their respects to the Mausoleum. The Central National Government held a commemorative ceremony.</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident this year, the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government moved to Luoyang, the temporary capital, to avoid the threat of Japanese military force, which has been going on for ten months. Now, because the banditry in various provinces has gradually been pacified, the League of Nations is about to hold a general assembly, and the capital has convenient transportation and is more suitable for international diplomacy. Therefore, on December 1st, it moved back to Nanjing, and on the morning of that day, it held a return ceremony at the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government respectively to commemorate the present. Chairman Lin of the National Government also set off from Luoyang with officials of this government on the 29th to return to Beijing, arriving in Pukou on the morning of the 1st. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Process of Returning to Beijing) Chairman Lin of the National Government's special train departed from Luoyang at 10 p.m. on the 29th, arrived in Kaifeng at 9 a.m. on the 30th, and stopped for five hours. Chairman Lin and his entourage got off the train to visit various scenic spots in Kaifeng. At 2 p.m., the train departed from Kaifeng, arrived in Xu at 9 p.m., and departed south from Xu at 11 p.m. At 8:30 a.m. on the 1st, it passed through Chu and arrived at Pukou Station at 9:45 a.m. The special train had a total of eight carriages, including one second-class carriage, three first-class sleeping carriages, a chartered carriage, and three guard luggage carriages, pulled by the No. 406 locomotive. Those who welcomed him at Pukou Station included Song Ziwen, Dai Chuanxian, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, Ye Chucang, Shao Yuanchong, Ju Zheng, Mao Zuquan, He Yaozu, Zhang Zhizhong, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Shuren, Tang Youren, Huang Shaoxiong, Niu Yongjian, Xiao Jishan, Gu Zhenglun, Huang Jiasong, Wu Siyu, Zeng Zhongming, Chen Gongbo, Luo Wengan, Chen Yi, Zhou Qigang, Shi Qingyang, Chen Shaokuan, Zeng Yiding, Gan Naiguang, Chen Yaoyuan, Liu Chongjie, Wang Yongbin, Chen Daqi, and senior officials of various departments, councils, and ministries, officials of the National Government's civil servants, military counselors, and accounting offices, and the National Government's military band. Lin and more than a thousand others. After the special train arrived at the station, the military band played music. Mr. Lin, wearing a blue cloth sheepskin robe, black mandarin jacket, black woolen overcoat, gray felt hat, and yellow leather shoes, got off the train with a smiling face amidst the melodious music and shook hands with Dai Song and others as a courtesy. Then he heard him walk out of the platform, to the pier, and boarded the Chu Qian warship. At 10:05, the ship hoisted the Marshal's flag and fired 21 salutes. The Chinese and foreign ships anchored on the Jiangmian River in Xiaguan also fired salutes and hoisted flags to pay their respects. The Chu Qian warship collided with Xiaguan at 10:15 and docked at the Sanbei Pier. Members of the Central Committee, including Ke Xing'e, Bai Yunzhou, members of the Legislative Yuan, and recommended officials of various agencies, as well as naval infantry, were all waiting here. After the ship docked, music was played on the shore. The welcoming personnel first landed ashore, followed by Chairman Lin, who took the National Government's No. 433 car and went straight to the Zhongshan Mausoleum. Those who accompanied Mr. Lin back to Beijing this time included Secretary-General Wei Huai, Director of the Archives Bureau Xu Jingzhi, Secretaries Zhu Wenzhong and Lin Yushi, Private Secretary Yao Jian, Military Counselors Ma Yubao and Mao Zhongfang, Section Chiefs Shen Xunzhou and Chen Xinbian, Zhang Naigong, and Zhang Yaode, who went to Luoyang to greet him, and more than 30 others. The guard regiment and Chief Military Counselor Lu Chao are still staying in Luoyang and are expected to return to Beijing in about three days. According to a certain secretary who accompanied Mr. Lin back to Beijing, some officials and guards from the Military Counselor's Office and the Civil Service Office remained in Luoyang to handle the safekeeping matters and will not return to Beijing for the time being.</p>
<p>(Situation of Paying Respects to the Mausoleum) Mr. Lin and Dai Song arrived at the Mausoleum at 10:40. Officials from various agencies had arrived here in advance to attend the ceremony. Except for Mr. Lin, who took a rattan sedan chair up the mountain, everyone else climbed the steps. At 11:00, the ceremony was held in the sacrifice hall, in the following order: (1) All stand at attention, (2) Play music, (3) Sing the Party song, (4) Bow three times to the portrait of the Premier (5) The Chairman respectfully reads the will, (6) Remain silent for three minutes, (7) Chairman Lin offers flowers, (8) Play music. The ceremony ended at 11:10. Lin, Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, Shao Yuanzhong and others all went to the rest room to rest, while the others entered the tomb passage one by one to pay their respects to the remains. At 11:20, Mr. Lin walked out of the sacrifice hall and exchanged greetings with a certain Westerner, a naval instructor, for a few words before taking the rattan sedan chair down the mountain and changing to a car to attend the ceremony at the National Government.</p>
<p>(Commemorative Ceremony) At 11:30, Chairman Lin and all civil and military officials of various departments, councils, and ministries went to the National Government Auditorium to hold a commemorative ceremony for their return to Beijing. Chairman Lin delivered a speech, roughly saying that last month in Luoyang, he received a telegram from the Central Government, saying that the Central Political Conference had resolved that the National Government would move back to Nanjing on December 1. Later, he received another telegram, saying that the Central Party Headquarters and other agencies in Luoyang would still be preserved and managed by personnel. He then prepared to move back after receiving the telegram and completed all the formalities by the end of November and returned to Beijing as scheduled. Now, during a period of tense diplomacy, in order to facilitate international diplomacy and the implementation of government orders, it is appropriate to move back to the capital in response to the needs of the times. However, Luoyang is an ancient cultural center. Although its cultural spirit is inevitably inferior in modern times due to various obstacles in transportation and economy, its people are simple, its customs are simple, and its products are abundant. Its majestic situation has special value in geography and history. The Central Government has decided to actively carry out the construction of Luoyang's temporary capital and Xi'an's auxiliary capital. This move is of vital importance. It is hoped that government colleagues will abide by this spirit and quickly go to work, and continue the hard-working spirit they had in Luoyang and make unremitting efforts. After the speech, photographs were taken and the meeting adjourned. At 12:00, Mr. Lin and members of the Central Committee held a relocation ceremony in the auditorium of the Central Party Headquarters, chaired by Ju.</p>
<p>Zheng presided over the report, roughly saying that the Central Committee, in accordance with the resolution of the Standing Committee, moved back to the capital today because the capital has convenient transportation and is easy to implement government orders. Chairman Lin also reported in detail at the National Government just now. We must know that the serious period of national crisis has not passed. We still hope that from today onwards, we will make efforts to fight against insults and suppress bandits and focus on important policies such as internal affairs and foreign affairs. The purpose of holding the return ceremony today is precisely this. The ceremony was then completed and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>(Jinan) Eight representatives of various leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia passed through Ji today and entered Beijing. According to them, the Central Government believes that the joint office of the Mongolian leagues in Beijing is being controlled by a few people, so the Mongolian Committee has ordered formal representatives of Inner Mongolia to go to Beijing to reorganize it in order to avoid separation between the upper and lower levels, and to make suggestions and reports on the Inner Mongolian border, and to ask for instructions. There are no Japanese in Inner Mongolia. The report that Japanese are active in Mongolia is not accurate. However, the biggest crises in Mongolia are redification and the White Russians. The Mongolian military system is weak. Usually, each banner has 1,000 to 2,000 soldiers, but in wartime, everyone is a soldier, but there are very few people in Mongolia now.

<p>U.S. Navy Uneasily Anxious About Japan, Claiming It Cannot Rush to Build New Ships, Naval Strength Will Be Lower Than Japan's</p>
<p>After the Army Chief of Staff Released a Smoke Screen of Increasing Troops, the White House is Deeply Concerned About Affecting Arms Reduction Negotiations</p>
<p>Washington, It is recently announced by the U.S. Navy Department that if the United States does not rush to build new ships, then by 1936, the U.S. naval strength will be downgraded to third place. Its tonnage will actually be lower than Japan's, and it will no longer be able to maintain the ten-to-seven ratio between England, America and Japan as stipulated in the London Treaty. According to its announced table, the naval strength of the three countries, England, Japan, and America, in 1936 will be as follows: (Unit: tons)</p>
<p>|           | England | Japan | America |</p>
<p>| :-------- | :------ | :---- | :------ |</p>
<p>| Destroyers | 96,298  | 76,776 | 16,500  |</p>
<p>| Submarines | 63,972  | 44,159 | 27,070  |</p>
<p>| Light Cruisers | 103,895 | 104,960 | 70,500  |</p>
<p>| Heavy Cruisers | 108,400 | 144,260 | 152,900 |</p>
<p>| Aircraft Carriers | 68,870  | 125,350 | 79,800  |</p>
<p>(World News Agency)</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency's Washington Dispatch of the 30th: Today, the U.S. State Department, regarding the suggestion to increase troops announced yesterday by Army Chief of Staff MacArthur, and involving the Sino-Japanese dispute, fearing that it would have an adverse impact on international issues such as arms reduction, after expressing concern, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Ballard, announced that the entire U.S. fleet will concentrate on the Pacific coast for exercises starting on February 6 next year and ending at the end of March. However, Ballard claimed that the original plan has not changed significantly, and after the exercises are completed, some warships will return to the Atlantic. According to reports, most of the U.S. fleet, including the Atlantic patrol fleet, has remained in the Pacific since the exercises this spring. The authorities have repeatedly stated that this move is only for the sake of saving money and has no other intention. On the recent Armistice Day, Major General Stirling gave a speech in Honolulu, reiterating this point to the local Japanese, asking them to tell their relatives and friends at home not to be suspicious of the U.S. military's exercises in the Pacific. Naval officers also often make this statement, trying to dispel others' doubts, but the true intention is obvious to anyone. As for MacArthur's suggestion to increase the army, it is said that Secretary of State Stimson was not informed of its content in advance, and the White House has remained silent on this matter so far. However, some parties believe that MacArthur's report will make it more difficult for the State Department to deal with international issues, and the progress of arms reduction issues may also be hindered. Regarding this point, the State Department stated today that the U.S. representatives at the arms reduction conference are drafting an arms reduction convention draft, including the points that various countries have already agreed upon, hoping to sign and pass it before the conference puts forward other suggestions. However, if the Sino-Japanese dispute is frequently mentioned here, it is feared that treaties of this nature will also be delayed. Furthermore, Congressman Collins, chairman of the Army Budget Subcommittee of the House of Representatives, also stated today that Mr. Mai’s proposal is extremely disappointing. It is expected that Congress will not allow the increase in military officers, and in fact, it may even reduce them. His personal opinion also advocates spending more money on mechanized weapons and less on supplying officers. In addition, many congressmen also said that Japan is now suspicious of the concentration of U.S. warships in the Pacific, and Mai’s comments involving the Sino-Japanese dispute are indeed an unfortunate move.</p>
<p>Kobe's Arms Smuggling Case</p>
<p>Nikkei News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – Prosecutors Ochiai and Ota from the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office went to Kobe on the 21st of last month to investigate the base for smuggling arms.

It is said that so far, 24 people, including Oda To, have been arrested in Kobe for smuggling, with the number of smuggled pistols reaching 240,000, tens of thousands of which are scattered throughout Japan. Someone in Tokyo purchased 200 pistols, imported at a price of 5 or 10 yuan per pistol, and sold for 70 or 80 yuan. It is said that Oda To accumulated assets of 450,000 yuan in several years.</p>

<p>England and France Send Replies to the United States</p>
<p>England's Reply Advocates for the Impact on International Trade, Urging the United States to Awaken</p>
<p>French Parliament Postpones Debate on War Debt Issue, Government Achieves Complete Victory</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – It is reported that the British reply to the war debt will be delivered to the U.S. government tomorrow. According to reports from Paris, the French reply will also be sent out tomorrow.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – The new British note to the U.S. regarding war debts does not mention payment methods, but focuses on the point that if the December installment of the debt is not postponed pending a comprehensive study of the war debt issue, international trade will definitely suffer extremely adverse effects, and that even if the United States receives 30 million pounds in gold from Britain, it will be a case of penny wise, pound foolish. The cabinet meeting today refined the final draft of this note. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain replied in the House of Commons to a question from opposition leader Lansbury, saying that the report that Britain will transport cash to the United States is unfounded.</p>
<p>Conservative Party in America Understands America's Position</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th – Conservative Party leader Baldwin stated in a speech in Glasgow tonight that America is understanding the difficulties the United States is facing regarding the war debt issue, and that he firmly believes that America's attitude toward Britain on the war debt issue is friendly. But that due to political and constitutional relations, it is not an easy time for America to do things. He hopes that people here will not rush to criticize it. This matter is complicated and is currently in progress. An inappropriate word will damage British-American relations.</p>
<p>French Chamber of Deputies Postpones Debate on War Debts</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 30th – According to newspaper reports, the French government is now making every effort to shorten the discussion in Parliament on the war debt issue, because continuing to publicly refute this issue will hinder the negotiations between the French Foreign Ministry and Washington. The person in Parliament who opposes the government's attitude most strongly is Mr. Marin. He has submitted a resolution to Parliament, stating that the French Parliament is unwilling to approve the payment of war debts before Germany continues to pay reparations. This resolution will be put forward for public debate on Thursday or Friday, and Prime Minister Herriot is expected to request a stop to the debate and treat it as a matter of government confidence.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 1st – Political circles here view Prime Minister Herriot as having achieved complete victory, because the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies decided not to ask the Chamber of Deputies to vote on Marin's proposal, with only one vote against. The Foreign Affairs Committee also decided to postpone the discussion of the war debt issue until the second half of this month.</p>
<p>Unprecedentedly Large Expenditure by the British Government, Totaling 700 Million Pounds</p>

<p>National News Agency, London, 30th – The British government will conduct an unprecedentedly large transaction tomorrow, involving an amount of nearly 700 million pounds, to end its plan to exchange 5% war bonds for new bonds. It is expected that the British government will pay bondholders 371,489,400 pounds tomorrow, of which 300 million pounds will be offset by the income from the newly issued 3% government bonds and 150 million pounds in treasury bills, and the remaining 71,489,400 pounds will be compensated from the unusually large supply of treasury bills this week.</p>
<p>British House of Commons Questions Far East Defense</p>
<p>Singapore Port Construction Project Proceeds as Usual, Paying Unremitting Attention to Air Defense and Anti-Poisoning, Navy Expresses Unwillingness to Make Unilateral Reductions</p>
<p>Havas, London, 30th – Three types of questions were raised to the government in the House of Commons today: (1) the situation in the British colonies in the East, with particular emphasis on India, (2) the relationship between Britain and Soviet Russia, (3) the Air Force and the issue of gas defense. Regarding the first question, the government confirmed that the construction of the Singapore naval base is proceeding as usual. Regarding the second question, a member of parliament said that Soviet Russia has several wireless telephone stations that constantly conduct anti-British propaganda and use codes to communicate with Soviet correspondents stationed in the United Kingdom. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that he was very worried about this matter, but believed that it was not useful to intervene at this time. Simon also said that he has not yet received a reply from Soviet Russia regarding the declaration to abolish the British-Russian trade agreement. Regarding the third question, the discussion at the meeting focused on the issue of commercial aviation. The questioner believed that this type of aviation could be quickly converted to military aviation. The government only replied that the government is studying the issue of air defense and is paying particular attention to defending against gas attacks.</p>
<p>Havas, 30th – Conservative Party member of the House of Commons, Betanfield, said that the government is reducing naval personnel and naval equipment, so that the navy cannot fulfill its protection responsibilities even in peacetime, which is very dangerous and the government should pay attention to it. He also said that the number of naval personnel is less than Japan's, and even less than the United States. Naval Minister Sir Monsell replied on behalf of the government that he was very pleased to take this opportunity to express the cabinet's attitude on this matter. It is estimated that by 1935, Britain will reduce its naval personnel and equipment by 47%, while the United States will increase by 29% and Japan by 37%. However, the British government will never reduce alone in the future. The meeting applauded warmly for this statement. As for Britain's naval reduction plan, it is proposed that if other countries can make equal sacrifices, further reductions can still be made, which is very important to Germany's return to the arms reduction conference, because Germany is an indispensable country in the arms reduction conference.</p>
<p>New Japanese Naval Formation</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – The naval authorities, in view of the extraordinary situation, are carefully studying the formation of the fleet for the coming year. It has now been decided as follows. Naval Minister Okada has been approved, so it was announced today.</p>

<p>Important British and French Figures Travel to Geneva Together</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Unable to Attend Due to Cabinet Turmoil, Five-Nation Arms Reduction Conference Suffers Setback</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 1st – British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon are traveling to Geneva together and are expected to arrive here tonight. They will have a brief conversation with Prime Minister Herriot. Army Minister Pengu will travel to Geneva with the two. Herriot will not be able to start his journey until Friday night. From the looks of it, the French authorities will strive to gain the support of British leaders for their arms reduction security plan.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st – Today, German Foreign Minister Neurath informed British Prime Minister MacDonald and French Prime Minister Herriot that he would be unable to go to Geneva until the German cabinet crisis is properly resolved. Therefore, the hope for Germany to rejoin the arms reduction conference has suffered another setback.</p>
<p>Various Aspects of the Arms Reduction Conference (Berlin Correspondence)</p>
<p>▲ Pessimistic About the Prospects of the Four-Power Conference</p>
<p>▲ Mussolini Makes a Blunt Statement</p>
<p>▲ Franco-Italian Conflict Intensifies</p>
<p>▲ Investigation into the Import and Export of Arms</p>
<p>▲ China is a Major Importer</p>
<p>Since the German government formally proposed the demand for arms equality, the arms reduction conference has been deadlocked. The London Five-Power Conference failed earlier, and the Geneva Four-Power Conference is also facing difficulties due to the location issue, and the German government has expressed its firm opposition. Therefore, it is difficult for us to be optimistic. France is unlikely to make concessions on this issue. Although Germany is under heavy pressure, its attitude is firm, and it is also difficult to soften it. Therefore, it does not require a wise man to know that this conference will surely be stranded again. Although Britain is superficially in a mediating position, it is inevitable that it will lean towards France. In this situation, Italy's anti-French and pro-German stance is the most obvious. Recently, the Fascists held a grand celebration for their tenth anniversary. Mussolini gave an impassioned speech in Turin to more than 200,000 people, in which he made a blunt statement regarding Germany's arms equality issue. Mr. Mo fundamentally acknowledged the rationality of Germany's demands, saying that the great powers must clearly acknowledge it. If the Four-Power Conference cannot give Germany any results, then it is completely right for Germany to leave the League of Nations and seek its own way out. However, Mr. Mo hoped that Germany would wait until the Four-Power Conference fails before taking other actions, and should not act rashly. This statement clearly indicated that after the failure of the Four-Power Conference, Germany can disregard France's attitude, withdraw from the League of Nations, and increase armaments freely. Mr. Mo also declared that there should not be a phenomenon of one country dominating the European continent, and even more so, there should not be hegemony based on inequality. His attitude of criticizing France was tantamount to challenging it. The French cannot tolerate this. The authorities in Paris have not heard of any repercussions to Mr. Mo's remarks, but their preparations for Italy have long been tense. Recently, Herriot has been busy negotiating a military secret agreement with Madrid and Spain, which is entirely to prepare for war against Italy. It is a fact that everyone knows. The relationship between France and Italy has deteriorated to such an extent, and the conflict has gradually become open and blatant. The so-called future of arms reduction is already bleak and hopeless, and it is feared that world peace will also be greatly threatened. But in the near term, we do not need to worry about its outbreak, because both sides still need time to prepare and have many concerns. This is why Mussolini's attitude, although already blatant, still accepted the invitation of Britain and France for the Four-Power Conference and did not want Germany to act rashly. The German public's sentiment is optimistic about the increasingly tense situation between France and Italy, and most believe that the conflict between France and Italy has been coming for a long time. The contradictions between the two countries in Africa, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean cannot be resolved, so it is difficult for them to find a peaceful compromise. However, some Germans believe that France is already in an isolated position, which is too optimistic. In fact, Britain's attitude is particularly noteworthy. The future situation still depends on Britain's direction. 乂乂乂乂乂乂</p>
<p>Regarding the manufacture of arms and the international trade in arms and military supplies, the arms reduction conference has also included it as an agenda item, seeking methods to manage it. The League of Nations Secretariat has submitted a statistics on this to the committee, up to the year 1929, but with numbers attached, it briefly records the subsequent investigation. Judging from the statistics it has made, the import and export of arms seem to be decreasing since 1930. The total export volume of arms and military supplies in 1929 was 64.3 million gold, but the amount exported in the first half of 1930 has been reduced to 27 million US dollars, and the export in the first half of this year is only more than 15 million, which is even greater than in previous years. The main exporting countries of arms and military supplies are Belgium, Britain, the United States, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, and other countries. In 1929, the United States exported the most, totaling 21.7 million US dollars. Britain was second, totaling 10.7 million. France was third, totaling 9.3 million. The rest, Belgium 3 million, Italy 3.7 million, Czech Republic, Netherlands, etc. also around 3 million. Adding the exports of other countries, the total is 64.3 million US dollars. There are fifty-three countries importing arms, but seventeen of them are the main buyers, accounting for seven-tenths of the total import. Among these seventeen countries, China, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Peru, and other countries import the most, all of which are backward countries. However, the buying and selling of arms and military supplies are mostly done secretly. The statistics of the League of Nations are actually superficial. The numbers listed above are what the exporting countries believe can be made public. The actual buying and selling will inevitably be far greater than these numbers. Recently, Japan has also imported a lot of arms. (October 29)</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Seize Ma Zhanshan's Secret Letter</p>
<p>Another Copy Conveyed to the League of Nations by a Foreign Journalist</p>
<p>Japan Claims Investigation Team Relied on It to Produce Report</p>
<p>Our Newspaper Translated on the 26th, Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reported that the strangest material in the League of Nations Investigation Team's report was the adoption of Ma Zhanshan's secret letter. This secret letter was made by Ma Zhanshan on May 8 in two copies, prepared to be submitted to the Investigation Team. The secret envoy he sent, Wang Qianlan, was about to take it to Ang'angxi to present it to the Investigation Team when it was discovered by the Qiqihar Gendarmerie. They surrounded and searched, and as a result, the letter was found in Wang's house. It is now on display at the Tokyo Yuryukan. Another copy, through the transfer of a journalist from a certain country, has fallen into the hands of the Investigation Team. The content of this letter slanders the Japanese military's atrocities to the extreme. Littleton obtained this secret report and used it as the basis for producing the report. It is heard that the General Assembly next month will submit it for discussion along with the report. The newspaper also made a copperplate of the secret letter and published it in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Chiang Orders Deng Xihou to Mediate the Sichuan War</p>
<p>Tian Songyao is Willing to Fully Support Zhang Qun's Leadership</p>
<p>Zhang Expresses Firm Refusal or May Enter Sichuan to Prepare for Rehabilitation</p>
<p>Communications from Hankou - After the Chongqing army occupied Luzhou, Fushun, and Neijiang, they took advantage of their victory to head straight for Xufu. Jianyang and Renshou are both under imminent attack, seemingly poised to advance on Chengdu and unify all of Sichuan. Deng Xihou, the commander of the 28th Army, fearing the expansion of the war, made every effort to mediate cooperation between Liu and Tian and issued a circular on the 19th, urging all parties to cease fire. Liu Wenhui, Tian Songyao, Liu Cunhou, and others all responded with a telegram on the 21st. The chaotic situation in Sichuan did not want to end the war immediately and did not reply to Deng's circular. Therefore, after capturing Xufu, they still wanted to attack Jiading and advance with all their strength towards Renshou and Jianyang. Deng and Tian, fearing that after resolving Liu Wenhui, they would be next, made concessions to each other, and cooperation was established. According to news from Chengdu, Deng, Tian, and Liu (Wenhui) met twice in the provincial capital. Liu Cunhou sent Liu Bangjun, and Yang Sen sent Bai Chu as representatives to participate. The general agreement was that Liu Wenhui would give the arsenal and gunpowder factory to Tian Songyao as a condition for jointly resisting Chongqing. Liu's troops are stationed in Renshou, Deng's troops are stationed in Jianyang, and Tian's troops are stationed in Lezhi. Because Tian did not agree to break with Liu Xiang immediately, Liu and Deng's armies were responsible for the front line. Rehabilitation measures were also discussed: (1) Welcome Zhang Qun and central government officials to Sichuan to reorganize Sichuan's administration. (2) Break up the defense zones and seek independent military needs. (3) Open up Chongqing and Wanxian, and avoid border blockades. (4) Consolidate border defenses. (5) Reorganize the provincial government. Regarding the selection of a successor to the chairmanship, many hope for Tian Songyao and Zhang Qun. In the midst of the meeting, the Central Daily issued an order to Sichuan, using whether or not they complied with the order to cease fire as the standard for obedience and defiance. The atmosphere of peace became more intense, and Liu Xiang also declared his willingness to resolve the issue peacefully. However, the troops of Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, Wang Zhiyi, and others still secretly advanced. According to the observations of most Sichuanese, this is the critical moment for the survival of Deng and Tian. A major battle between Renshou and Jianyang is feared to be unavoidable. If Chongqing wins, they will head straight for Chengdu. If Chengdu wins, they will counterattack Chongqing. Although peace is advocated at this time, the tension among the troops is perhaps even greater than before. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has always attached great importance to the Sichuan war. In order to quell the conflict as soon as possible, he specially ordered Deng Xihou on the 29th to be responsible for mediation and await central government resolution. It is difficult to predict how Deng will mediate. However, because of this telegram, he may not be able to join the vortex immediately. As for Central Committee member Zhang Qun, after being urged by all parties, he is willing to enter Sichuan. Zhang issued a telegram on the Central Daily, revealing his proposals. The central government will also organize a Sichuan Rehabilitation and Reorganization Committee, giving Zhang the position of chairman, and the generals of Sichuan are willing to support Zhang's administration, so as to thoroughly transform and support it. Tian himself hopes to enter Shaanxi and take on bandit suppression work. Zhang wrote a letter to a Sichuan native here on the 30th, strongly declining this position, saying that he does not want to be tied down by a fixed position, but he did not express his intention to resign from the position of chairman of the Reorganization Committee. The situation in Sichuan is more complex than in any other province, and the generals are more fickle than any other warlords. Zhang's unwillingness to immediately take up a fixed position may also be due to the need to carefully observe the attitudes of the generals and think deeply. (November 30)</p>

<p>▲ Quarry Truck Kills Villager. The Zhongxing Quarry Company of Tianmashan extracts stones from the mountain and has laid narrow-gauge railways to facilitate transportation. This railway runs straight down from the mountain and pedestrians are wary when passing by. However, at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 29th), when four trucks loaded with stones were moving downhill, Zhu Jinzhu, a 22nd-Tu township woman, and her mother were passing by. Zhu Jinzhu failed to dodge in time and was crushed to death. The party concerned, Gu Shaoming, reported this to the 12th Substation, and the company's accountant, Xue Jiqing, and the four carters involved, Ji Changfa, Zhang Yuanliang, the foreman Wang Xitang, were taken to the substation and sent to the General Bureau. At the same time, the body was handed over to the township police to guard, pending a report to the prosecutor's office for inspection.</p>
<p>▲ Robbery Suspects of Xingye Bank Escorted to Songjiang. The robbery case of the Songjiang branch of China Xingye Bank was solved by Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team of the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau, who arrested six suspects, including Niu Jinpu, Sun Hanquan, Chen Shaobo, Li Yingshou, Niu Guo, and Shao. After interrogation by the Third Section of the bureau, they were found to be highly suspected. Yang Shi, an inspector of the county Public Security Bureau, was ordered to hold a document yesterday evening (the 30th) and led detectives to Shanghai to bring the suspects. The six suspects, Niu Jinpu and others, were brought back to Songjiang by slow train on the afternoon of the first day.</p>
<p>▲ Major Theft Cases Successively Solved. The theft case that occurred at the post office in this city at the end of last year has been unsolved for a long time, and the superiors have strictly ordered the case to be solved. After investigation by Yang Shi, an inspector of the County Public Security Bureau, the main suspect, Tang Jinxiang, and others were arrested, taken to the bureau for questioning, and transferred to the county court for verification. Yang Shi also learned from the investigation the other day that a wanted robber from Pu Nan was hiding in Caojiadu, Shanghai. He quietly led the detectives to the location and arrested Jin Youcai and Xiao Zifa. They confessed to robbing the property of Wang Caixing and Pan Jiesun in Tuolin Yutang Township, Pu Nan, and the families of Long Sheng and others in Caojing Songjiadu. They were immediately taken back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The stolen goods are currently being recovered.</p>

<p>▲ Mei Lanfang Visits Scenic Spots. Mei Lanfang and his wife came to Suzhou this time to visit scenic spots. Yesterday (the 1st) at 11:00 a.m., they went to the county government to visit the county magistrate, Zou Jing, but they did not meet him because Zou went to the philanthropist to inspect the new rural area. They also visited the Canglang Pavilion and the Daohe Qushe. In the evening, they responded to the banquet of Zhang Yihe, a local gentleman. Mei talked about his opinions on reforming opera, saying that the special feature of Chinese opera is its deep emotion. When he went to the United States, he wanted to integrate Chinese and foreign operas, but the result was that it was difficult to succeed because of the fundamental differences. He felt that Chinese opera could only be selected and reorganized to make it purer. Even Chinese music is difficult to integrate with European and American music.</p>
<p>▲ Gu Weian's Appeal Rejected. Gu Weian, a student at Shanghai Law School, and Zhao Yueying, a woman from Changzhou, fell in love freely. In the autumn of the 19th year, they cohabited in Dongfang Apartment. A son was born the following year and died soon after. Later, Gu became infatuated with Lei Peizhi from Hangzhou. In August of this year, Gu and Zhao traveled to Suzhou, and Lei also arrived. After Gu found out, he went to the Central Hotel to meet with Lei. Zhao rushed to negotiate, and they were taken to the police station. Zhao wrote a letter to her grandmother, Mrs. Zhang, to come. At this time, Gu had been escorted to the court by the police station. Mrs. Zhang then filed a lawsuit, accusing Gu of interfering with her family, and he was sentenced to six months in prison and fined 200 yuan. Gu refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court. Yesterday (the 1st), the judgment was announced, and the appeal was rejected. It is heard that Gu still refused to accept it and must appeal again.</p>

<p>The Japanese plainclothes detectives secretly arresting people this time is not only a violation of police regulations, but also an obstruction to public security within the concession. In order to protect the residents of the concession, a public lawsuit has been filed against the two Japanese detectives with the Second Special District Court. According to the New Voice News Agency, the case of Japanese plainclothes police officers illegally arresting a Korean, Jin Che, in the French Concession the other night has been clarified. It is now known that the arrested person is not Korean, but a naturalized Chinese. This has caused serious negotiations between China and France with the Japanese consulate. In addition to the French consul actively preparing to protest to France and Japan, our side will also submit serious protests to the French and Japanese consulates today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Incident - On the evening of the previous day (30th) at 8:40 p.m., seven Japanese men in plainclothes, in three cars, went to Ruyili No. 2, Nanyang Bridge South, Blue View Road, French Concession, the residence of Zhou Baohua, a Chinese. Without asking the circumstances, they kidnapped Jin Yongdu, a tenant living upstairs, and his eldest son, Jin Zhe. At that time, Jin Yongdu was unable to resist due to old age and was kidnapped by four Japanese men in plainclothes. His son, Jin Zhe, was still struggling with three Japanese men when an Annamese patrolman heard the alarm and</p>

<p>Important Educational News</p>
<p>The Shandong Provincial Government Strictly Orders Students to Return to Classes | Comply with Ministry Regulations for Joint Examinations |</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Korean Province Urges Students</p>
<p>Students Prepare to Attend Classes Today</p>
<p>Jinan Special Dispatch, Today at 7 AM: Han convened all members of the provincial committee and the provincial government secretary, the mayor of Jinan, etc., in a provincial government meeting to resolve the student unrest. It was decided to strictly order the Department of Education to order all schools to resume classes. The order is as follows: As a directive, it is reported that students in various secondary schools in the provincial capital have boycotted classes due to refusing examinations. Such ignorance is deeply regrettable and should be strictly controlled to rectify the situation. The following measures are hereby stipulated: 1. All students in boycotting schools must resume classes uniformly by this Friday; otherwise, all students currently enrolled will be immediately dismissed and required to leave the school within a time limit, except for those who have applied for leave of absence for valid reasons. 2. The leading students in all boycotting schools shall be investigated by the respective principals and reported to the Department for verification and handling. 3. The Department shall still strictly abide by the Ministry's orders to conduct joint examinations and shall not delay or be perfunctory. Therefore, the Department is hereby ordered to promptly and conscientiously comply and report the compliance status for verification without fail. This order is issued.</p>
<p>At 11 AM, fifteen student representatives from eight schools that boycotted classes went to the provincial government to meet with Han. The Director of the Department of Education, He Siyuan, was also present. The representatives requested: (1) opposition to the education authorities, (2) first, order the expelled colleagues from high school to return to school before resuming classes. Han replied: (1) the education authorities are conducting joint examinations under orders, which is not harmful and cannot be opposed simply by opposing the joint examinations, (2) classes must resume first before ordering the expelled students from high school to return. The representatives initially argued, but after Han's earnest persuasion, emphasizing the difficulty of earning money through parents' and siblings' blood and sweat and the considerable public education expenses, they agreed to return to school and inform their classmates to resume classes. Each school is preparing to resume classes tomorrow morning. The student unrest is gradually subsiding. The provincial government strictly prohibits the unauthorized distribution of leaflets and slogans. If the Public Security Bureau fails to detect and prevent such activities, the director will be imprisoned for three years, and those who provide information leading to arrests will be rewarded with 200 yuan.

Yesterday, the Department issued an order stating that the school's campus, economic equipment, and organization were largely non-compliant. Despite being established for years, the content has not been enriched, indicating no hope for improvement. It is ordered to promptly cease operations, be responsible for closing by the end of the current semester, etc. The Ministry of Education Promulgates Kindergarten and Elementary School Curriculum Standards (20)</p>
<p>Fourth, Key Points of Teaching Methods</p>
<p>(1) In the elementary school curriculum, subjects such as labor, society, and nature should be based on the Principle of People's Livelihood and the Premier's Nation-Building Strategies regarding material construction, eliminating the drawbacks of previous teaching materials based on scientific classification. However, detailed exploration of natural materials should still be based on the following principles: (1) It must be based on local materials. (Note) The circumstances of agricultural and industrial societies are obviously different. Teaching materials, in addition to those included in this standard, should be collected locally. Materials found in this standard but not available locally may be omitted, but should still be introduced using books, etc., to stimulate children's thinking and expand their experiences. (2) It must be suitable for the season and solar terms. (3) It must be suitable for the children's immediate needs and understanding abilities. (4) It must be important and representative.</p>
<p>(2) Because materials may vary in different locations and schools, the teaching of the natural sciences should fully utilize the local environment and not rigidly adhere to textbooks. Reference books for this subject should be fully adopted. The editing of detailed guides for children to read reference books can be compiled for each question. The content should include many illustrations and tables, and guide methods of doing and learning. The text should be as simple as possible, focusing on application and using common nouns instead of academic terms to emphasize principles and theories.</p>
<p>(3) Urban schools should ideally have a school garden to cultivate plants as a living classroom and textbook. They should also regularly collect materials in the wild or visit factories, shops, and hospitals, fully utilizing living textbooks and classrooms. Rural elementary schools should further utilize fields and forests as places for learning and doing, rather than being confined to lifeless classrooms.</p>
<p>(4) If special classrooms are equipped, the form and arrangement of desks and chairs in the classroom should facilitate listening, note-taking, and group experiments. Window flower stands, insect boxes, aquariums, thermometers, and appropriate experimental instruments, medicines, and reference books can be set up. Outside the classroom, weather vanes, rain gauges, thermometers, barometers, etc., should be placed at appropriate locations.</p>
<p>(5) Regardless of whether the school is economically prosperous, simple experimental instruments, common animal and plant specimens, and models should be guided by children themselves to manufacture (i.e., achieving the purpose of knowing through doing). Specimens and impractical instruments that cannot arouse children's interest and enable them to acquire real knowledge should not be used unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>(6) Free or inexpensive books, specimens, models, and other materials should be jointly collected and utilized by teachers and children.</p>
<p>(7) In teaching, the tasks of the teacher should be: (1) Providing natural materials, arousing children's curiosity and interest, and stimulating them to raise questions that need to be solved and engage in exploration or observation activities. (2) Guiding children to use their own methods to carry out these activities to success. (3) Further guiding them to continue to develop and deepen the experiences gained from these activities. (4) At the end of a research project, highlighting the natural beauty of the subject and its universal laws so that children can appreciate and cherish it. (8) Teachers themselves should have a wealth of knowledge about common things and be able to repair simple machines and manufacture simple appliances.</p>
<p>(9) Teaching should fully integrate various teaching materials from subjects such as society, labor, art, and hygiene to design large units. For example, silkworms can start from recognizing silk and how silk is woven, linking various issues such as the life characteristics of silkworms, the shape and properties of silk (nature), silkworm rearing and mulberry planting, silk reeling, dyeing, spinning, weaving, the situation of the silk weaving industry (labor), the silk production area, the relationship between silk and our country, the position of silk in the world, the invention and progress of silk (society), silk thread manufacturing, embroidery methods (labor), silkworm sketching, silk pattern designs (art), silkworm disease history (hygiene), etc. However, attention must be paid to the following two principles: (1) The scope of the question must correspond to the level of the children. For example, in the first and second grade silkworm design, higher-level questions such as "the relationship between silk and our country" and "the position of silk in the world" should not be involved. (2) The connection should be natural and necessary. For example, in silk design, there may be stories and poems about silk that can be used as teaching materials in Chinese and music, but there may be no games or sports related to silk in physical education. Therefore, physical education may not need to be connected, and inappropriate teaching materials should not be pieced together.</p>
<p>(10) Direct experience by children is a major principle in the teaching of natural sciences. In addition to personal observation, listening, and experiencing, it is also necessary to do it by hand. Doing can be divided into two aspects: (1) What can be done in the labor subject should be fully done. (2) What cannot be done in the labor subject should be fully tried in the course or extracurricular time of this subject.</p>
<p>(11) Observations, studies, and experiments that take a long time to achieve results should guide children to do them day by day and record the progress until there are results to report.</p>
<p>(12) Teachers should carefully check the children's work.</p>
<p>(13) Teachers can reveal achievements, express results, hold exhibitions, etc., for children's work to encourage children's interest. Educational Inspection Team Continues to Visit Schools in Lyon</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Lyon, 30th: The Chinese educational inspection team is currently inspecting various educational institutions here. As noted in yesterday's telegram, the agency's reporter specifically interviewed members of the team to inquire about the team's precise mission and purpose. Two years ago, the League of Nations, at the request of the Chinese government, sent an international educational survey team to China to conduct comparative research on European and Chinese educational methods and to assist China in reforming education. This work has been published in important documents. After contacting international organizations, the Chinese government also selected personnel from among university professors to form a survey team to visit Poland, Germany, Denmark, France, Britain, Italy, and Australia to investigate education. The United States may also be visited. The team currently visiting here is this group. The team members are all outstanding figures in the Chinese academic community. Their itinerary is scheduled to stay in each country for two weeks, visiting the internal organization of various schools, comparing the curricula of schools at all levels and various types of education, and studying their educational methods. The team is extremely interested in education in the city of Lyon, believing that the relationship between national university education and private higher education is the closest. For example, the private Institute of Chemical Research has a board of directors and an independent budget, and its chairman is the dean of the National University's School of Science. The Chinese educational survey team pays close attention to such cooperation between public and private education. Lyon also has a Sino-French University to encourage Chinese students to study in France. The team members are well aware of the importance of their mission and collect a wealth of reference materials. They pay close attention to the evolution of educational principles and the methods of training elementary school teachers. Yesterday, they visited the Lamar Martiniere National Vocational School, where they were received by the school's principal, Mr. Constance, who presented them with many published documents related to mechanization, chemistry, electricity, and commerce. Today, they visited the National Veterinary School, the Lyon School of Science, and the Dental School. At noon, the university president hosted a banquet. Chinese history is long and rich in scholarship, and modern educational methods are attractive, but their application in China is sometimes not well suited to national character. The team's findings this time will be fruitful, and they will certainly harmonize the old and the new to meet the hopes of Chinese reformers. We will wait and see.

<p>Five-Year Plan to be Drafted</p>
<p>Review and Approve Regulations and Curriculum</p>
<p>Increase Books and Equipment</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Jinan University has been reorganized after the war and is now ready. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to the school to inspect and saw that the recovery was rapid and the staff and students were at ease in their work, which was highly appreciated. Recently, the school has specially approved Secretary-General Yang Yufen and Dean Chen Zhongfan, Yu Jitai, Ye Yuan, and Chief of the Department of Culture Shi Mu to draft a five-year plan, to determine a concrete and thorough plan for administration, education, and training, and to implement it in stages based on economic conditions and environmental needs. Currently, regarding the curriculum, all the main educational staff of the school have been asked to form a curriculum review committee, which meets once a week to study the gains and losses. In the future, the four-year curriculum of the university will be based on the following principles: the first year will focus on strengthening basic tools and common knowledge, the second year will focus on basic training in various subjects, the third year will focus on professional training, and the fourth year will focus on applied skills and modern new academics. After the completion, experts from home and abroad will be invited to criticize it in order to make it perfect. The school has developed rapidly in recent years, and various organizations and systems have been increased and decreased. Recently, a regulations review committee was established, and Fan Shouzhi, Yang Yufen, Sun Hanbing, Pu Songling, and Hong You were appointed as members to review all the regulations of the school in order to have a basis for implementing the five-year plan.

<p>A Grand View of the Shanghai Basketball Association</p>
<p>76 Teams Have Already Participated</p>
<p>There are still four team quota</p>
<p>The registration of old members of the Shanghai Basketball Association ended the night before last. A total of 76 teams, including Fudong, Xinyang, and China Bank, were disqualified from membership in the previous competition due to forfeiting twice. According to Article 14 of the Association Regulations, "Those who have been disqualified from membership due to forfeiting must submit a solid letter of guarantee for the next competition and request it to be re-joined with the approval of the committee (the joining fee will be considered as a new member)." The three teams should send a letter of guarantee to the committee within a few days requesting approval. If approved by the committee, they can rejoin the competition as new members (paying a joining fee of 10 yuan). If this procedure is not followed, the three teams cannot join the competition. The remaining vacancies will be filled by new members.</p>
<p>The number of basketball teams in this year's competition is limited to 80. There are already 76 old members registered, and there are only four new member quotas. Registration is scheduled to begin immediately and end on the 6th. After the deadline, the committee will meet on the 7th to discuss and decide. The method is recorded below.</p>
<p>Separate arrangements, review requests for guarantee to join the team and the date of the start of the game, etc., are scheduled to be discussed at a committee meeting on the 7th. The list of the first team to register members is as follows:</p>
<p>Tongji Xi Qingqing Light Youth Holding Team Mai Ling Zhenru Jianhua Huadong Qianghua Shangzhong Youbao Fa Nanxing Jiang Tong Red Team Xiaguang Jewish Tu Jin Team Seven Teams All Black Chu Guang Feifei Nanguang Le Youyou Guang San San Quan Guang Qingxin Morning Team Evening Star Xinguang Muer Guang Qixing San Yi Striving Night Team Starlight Nanxing Ruwei Chengqing Rover Zhongshe Xiping Locke Rainbow Team Frog Team Fuzhong Xinyang Black Cat Mashang Chuping Pingnan Fang Zhujiang Industrial and Commercial National Postal Le Yu Le Shi Shangxing Mars China Huofeng Fang Xie Jiangdong Jing Yao Guang (B) Tianjin-Shanghai Inter-Port Football Match</p>
<p>Tianjin Invites Shanghai Team to Go North</p>
<p>The Date is Scheduled Around the New Year for Mutual Learning</p>
<p>But the Shanghai Team Has to Go South to Hong Kong, So There is Little Hope</p>
<p>The inter-port football match was originally between Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. This time, the Hong Kong team came to Shanghai and won Shanghai 4-3.</p>
<p>Then it will not go south. However, the Tianjin Western Business Football Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Western Football Association on the 28th, inviting the Shanghai team to go north, the time is scheduled around the New Year. If the Shanghai team can do it again, Tianjin will start preparing immediately. However, the Shanghai team has scheduled to go south to Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year. Judging from the situation, it is difficult to make it a reality, because the Shanghai team has already had two inter-port matches this year. ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ International Race Walking Competition to be Held After the Day | The Chinese Team Will Distribute Number Cloths Today |</p>

<p>Rocket and Invisibility Methods Discussed in the Local Supplement of Shen Bao</p>
<p>佛</p>
<p>Recent reports state that Austrian engineer Gwet met recently invented a method of invisibility on the battlefield, and formal experiments are being conducted. The method involves placing mirrors at a specific angle in front of soldiers or fortifications one wishes to hide. These mirrors reflect a portion of the ground in front of them, making the enemy see only the ground and not the soldiers or artillery behind the mirrors. According to a dispatch from Magdeburg, German engineer Niepel has been researching rockets for many years and has now announced that he will build a rocket capable of carrying one person by next spring. If successful, this will be an unprecedented achievement in rocket history, opening a new chapter in aviation.</p>
<p>The above two scientific inventions are indeed astonishing feats. In our scientifically backward country, we cannot even dream of catching up. Aviation, for example, has already evolved from an ideal to a reality, from novelty to commonplace, entirely due to scientific inventions. If science does not advance, even ideals are futile. I once saw the following story in Chinese history: Emperor Wu of Wei, on a whim, thought that if birds can fly, why can't humans? He then ordered a search for ways for humans to fly. As a result, someone wove large bird feathers and attached copper rings to their waist, using their hands to fan. In the end, they could only fly a few steps before stopping, because arm strength is limited and lacks endurance. This kind of ideal ultimately could not be realized. Now, it has become the aviation world, all thanks to the power of science.</p>
<p>Or, some might say, "Don't boost others' morale and diminish your own." Other sciences might not dare compete with foreign countries, but when it comes to rocket and invisibility methods, I dare say we are not lagging behind. The term "invisibility method" was originally invented in our country. Not only invisibility, but all five escapes are also easy to achieve. In "Investiture of the Gods," "Journey to the West," "Conquest of the East," and other books, we can often see people disappearing with a shake of their body. Even in recent times, the Boxers and Red Spear Society also had the ability to be immune to guns and cannons. As long as they chanted incantations, the enemy's bombs and artillery would be useless. As for rockets, they are even less worth mentioning. Haven't our scientists repeatedly tested flying thunder and flying arrows? It is said that the results were excellent. If flying thunder and flying arrows can be invented, rockets should not be absolutely impossible either. Seeing the rapid progress of foreign science, I can't help but feel speechless when I think of our country's former and modern scientists. Seeing batches of our students returning home with titles such as doctor or master of political science, economics, law, and literature, I can't help but take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Several Fruit Cultivation Methods</p>
<p>Rui Yucheng</p>
<p>This article probably cannot be finished in one go. I will now only discuss the three most common types in detail:</p>
<p>(1) Pear: A plant of the Rosaceae family. Those produced in the Yellow River basin of our country, such as in Shandong and Henan, are called Yellow Pears, also known as Ya'er Pears. Those produced south of the Yangtze River in Xuancheng, Anhui, are called White Pears, also known as Snow Pears. Those produced north of the Yangtze River in Henan are called Purple Pears, also known as Purple Crisp Pears. Those produced in Zhejiang are called Wooden Pears. Pears can be eaten raw and can also be used as raw materials for sweets, as well as for winemaking and flavoring. The cultivation methods are as follows: (1) Climate: Pears are cold-resistant and like humidity. They are afraid of wind and rain when flowering. Those planted in the north should be planted on south-facing slopes. Those planted in the south should be planted on north-facing slopes. (2) Soil: Sandy loam with dry topsoil and moist subsoil is the most suitable. Loose clay soil is also acceptable. (3) Fertilizer: Human manure, compost, and stable manure are all suitable. (4) Cultivation method: There are three methods of pear propagation: sowing, cutting, and grafting. Sowing and cutting are used for grafting stock; otherwise, the fruit will definitely be poor. Grafting is divided into bud grafting, cutting grafting, and approach grafting, among which cutting grafting is the most common. The types of rootstock also include using hawthorn pear, jujube, or pomegranate instead of pear rootstock. (5) Harvesting and storage: When harvesting fruits, it must be done on a sunny day. Choose those with hard fruit, good color, and aroma, and pick them by hand. If you want to transport them to distant places or store them, pay attention not to damage them, and pick them slightly earlier. After picking, wrap each one in paper and store them in boxes. Be sure not to bump them and cause them to rot.</p>
<p>(2) Apple: Apples also belong to the Rosaceae family. Hebei Province produces the most and the best quality. Those produced north of the Yangtze River are far inferior. They can be eaten raw or made into dried fruits or preserved in sugar and used for winemaking. The cultivation methods are as follows: (1) Climate: Apples like cold and dislike warmth and dryness. Those produced in unsuitable places are not good. The best planting direction is southeast and south. They are afraid of strong winds after flowering and fruiting. (2) Soil: Soil with topsoil and subsoil is the best. Other soils such as high and dry solid soil, sandy loam, calcareous loam, clay loam, and sandy loam are all acceptable. (3) Fertilizer: In the early stage, cattle and horse manure, dust, and mustard are good. After they grow up, human manure and urine are suitable. The best fertilizer is a mixture of dust, weeds, decayed matter, rice bran, and oil cake, which is allowed to rot and then mixed with three times the amount of water. (4) Cultivation method: There are four methods of apple propagation: sowing, layering, cutting, and grafting. Grafting is the most common method. Hawthorn pear is often used as rootstock. The method of grafting is the same as for pears. (5) Harvesting and storage: Harvest can be done by picking them gradually when they are not fully ripe. After picking, they must be placed in a dry and cool place, maintaining a temperature of about 45 degrees to ripen them. The storage method is similar to that of pears. However, after putting them into wooden boxes, they must be filled with dry grass or soft materials such as rice husks to prevent frost damage.</p>
<p>The above two are only the most common ones. There are also oranges, pomelos, peaches, plums, apricots, dates, cherries, plums, grapes, olives, figs, chestnuts, walnuts, ginkgo, lychees, longans, etc., which are all planned to be discussed one by one. This article has to end temporarily due to space limitations.</p>
<p>Literary Waves Washing Sand</p>
<p>(Following Jiaxuan's style)</p>
<p>Increasing education, rising to dance, listening to the morning bell,</p>
<p>A myriad of thoughts colliding,</p>

<p>What's the matter with wandering like tumbleweeds on the edge of the world,</p>
<p>Wailing in desperation,</p>
<p>Times create heroes,</p>
<p>Abandoning the pen for the sword,</p>
<p>Bloody flowers blooming on the battlefield,</p>

<p>Like a Dream</p>
<p>(On a classmate, Mr. Jin's portrait)</p>
<p>Looking down on the weeds and filth of the crowd,</p>
<p>Forever regretting the premature call of the cuckoo,</p>
<p>Trampling through the soft, red dust,</p>
<p>A clear and bright essence still remains,</p>
<p>Don't slacken, don't slacken,</p>
<p>Our generation faces many difficulties,</p>
<p>上操</p>
<p>Be fearless.</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Hui's article "Young Master Soldiers" in this publication, and I couldn't help but think of the situation last year when we, also so-called young master soldiers, were doing exercises. It seems to be worth describing, and it can also be seen as an expression of the students' patriotic enthusiasm?</p>
<p>The September 18th Incident was certainly a major stimulus for the students! Although our school didn't suspend classes to practice, doing the trick of "clutching Buddha's feet in the face of emergency?" However, we also added two hours of military exercises every day. The time allocation was from 6:30 to 7:30 in the morning and from 4 to 5 in the afternoon. Although getting up early in the morning was very unpleasant for those who liked to sleep, for the sake of the national crisis, we gritted our teeth and got out of the hot bedding every day.</p>
<p>On mornings when the fog was hazy and the cold wind was blowing, you could see young master soldiers going to the stadium for exercises on Dalin Road. The day students wore military uniforms over cotton robes and military hats on their heads, carrying schoolbags (the boarding students had one less schoolbag). They looked like Hong Kong beef vendors? (This is what Instructor Liu often said.)</p>
<p>Shanghai has three many: many young masters, many bums, and many modern women.</p>
<p>After the emergency horse-returning bugle blew, the three companies of young master soldiers had already lined up in formation. After the platoon leaders finished calling the roll, the exercises began, and then the jokes came.</p>
<p>When Instructor Liu shouted "Lie down!" everyone naturally lay down on the ground, but at the same time, a noisy sound also came out.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's cold lying on the ground! It's like eating ice cream?"</p>
<p>"Don't make noise! If there are real enemy planes above, wouldn't we all be bombed to death!" The instructor said angrily to be quiet. At this time, the instructor gave another order, "Stand up!" Everyone quickly stood up from the ground, not following a fixed method. Some crawled up, and some stood up by leaning on others. It can be said that they exhausted all kinds of postures. At the same time, there were sounds of "pat! pat! pat!" of dusting off dust, mixed with laughter of "My white gloves are dirty?" This made the instructor extremely angry, but he couldn't hit anyone, so he had to say very disdainfully,</p>
<p>"You can't even wait until after the exercise to dust off this little bit of dust. If you were in the army, you would have been beaten long ago!" So everyone stopped for a while.</p>
<p>Individual training began, and another comical incident happened. Nicknamed Pei Sikai, W, who was used to being a young master; wearing a military uniform was already enough to make him uncomfortable. Now that he was called out to exercise; it naturally made him even more unnatural. When he started walking, he actually moved his left hand and foot forward together, earning a round of laughter. Fortunately, the closing bugle blew, relieving his embarrassment. After giving the instructor a left-hand salute, he had already scattered and returned to school. The so-called exercise had to be temporarily suspended; waiting for the four o'clock performance again!</p>
<p>Returning Home</p>
<p>Haiwu</p>
<p>He is a wanderer at the edge of the world, wandering far away from his hometown for the sake of his parents' and wife's food and clothing, doing the work of exchanging sweat for money. He has been away from home for a long time, and he hasn't wanted to go home to comfort his parents and wife who are thinking of him day and night, but seeing the cloth robe on his body that he hasn't changed since he left home, it only makes him gasp.</p>
<p>It seems that this is his proudest moment, he has changed into a new cloth robe, and he has also bought some things for the family, ready to go home.</p>
<p>On his way home; in the train, in the sailboat, he thought this way, wanting to vent the hardships of his work outside and the anger of being whipped by capitalists to his parents and wife. This hardship, this anger, who else can he vent to but his parents and wife!</p>
<p>When he returned home, although his parents and wife all put on a forced smile to welcome him, but when he saw the children's yellow and thin faces, the old father chopping wood, the old mother weaving cloth, and the young wife spinning, all stopped working for him, which made his heart immediately ache, regretting this trip home.</p>
<p>He really didn't dare to vent his hardship and anger to his parents and wife, and had to comfort his parents and wife first. In less than three days, he was willing to leave his parents and wife again, bearing tears to endure the hardship of work and the whipping of capitalists.</p>
<p>Origins and Simple Rules of Shop Assistant Communications</p>
<p>In this 60th anniversary of our newspaper, we have contributed to the local business community by establishing a circulating library and publishing an amateur weekly. Now we feel the complexity of the local social environment, especially the shop assistants and apprentices in various stores and companies, who have more opportunities to come into contact with society for business reasons. In this situation, whether it is the social or individual aspect, many difficult problems will inevitably arise, but the individual's knowledge is ultimately limited, and only by gathering ideas and benefiting from each other can we achieve mutual improvement. Therefore, we have specially opened a shop assistant communication column to welcome everyone to raise various difficult problems.

<p>First Question Answer Contest – Disclosed Correct Answers</p>
<p>Intelligence and Virtue Both Exist,</p>
<p>One will not bear to abandon their father. The reason is that it is not abandonment, but an inability to do so. There are three reasons: a boat sails towards the opposite bank, the father falls from the bow, and the boat crushes the father's body. Zhi De knows a little about swimming, but his skills are not good, and he is not capable of saving his father from under the boat. Second, searching for people under the boat will take a long time, and it is likely that they will all perish together. Fortunately, he was rescued that day. His father is old and has lost his grandson, and if he does not die in the water, he will die of illness. Also, it is not known how many children Zhi De has. Suppose he is the only child, and the future is worrying. Moreover, the people are the foundation of the village, and the son is the foundation of the family. For the sake of the country's talents, and for the sake of the family's lineage, saving the son is not blameworthy. Third, if the father is rescued from under the boat and the three people die together, who will comfort the old mother at home? Therefore, bearing the name of endurance is not without benefit. His actions are sad, and his heart is kind. Gentlemen who live in the world should be strict with themselves and lenient with others. Praising good and hating evil is something that exists within us, and it is called wisdom to encourage goodness.</p>
<p>Offering a pear is a small matter, often neglected by ordinary people. However, one does not know that parents are old and increasingly out of touch with the world, while young children have a long future. There is always another chance, and it is not just a single pear. The child's eyes are red and swollen, indicating that he is too arrogant and willful. Although he is only five years old, he is gradually developing intentions. Not pre-dividing the food is to suppress his arrogance. Is this not the way to teach children?</p>
<p>Zhi does not make unnecessary sacrifices, and De can endure one's own love. It is permissible to call him Zhi De, or it may be appropriate.</p>
<p>The gentleman loves people with virtue, valuing their aspirations above all else, valuing their reputation in the middle, and valuing their body below. The gentleman plans matters with blessing in mind, the blessing of a family on a small scale, the blessing of a country on a large scale, and the blessing of the world on a broad scale. All people possess this aspiration. The father of Zhi De possesses this aspiration, and he himself possesses this aspiration. The son is also a person, so how can this aspiration not arise? The father is old, and his aspirations exist but his strength is exhausted, so he uses this to encourage his children and grandchildren. Preserving his grandson is to pass on his father's aspiration, to love his father's aspiration, and to show filial piety to his father's aspiration. The birth of a person is to come by the command of Heaven. To come by the command of Heaven is to transmit the command of Heaven, to practice the way of Heaven. Those who practice the way of Heaven help people and help the world. The affairs of one person or one family are small matters. The gentleman does not desire the pleasures of sound and color, nor the desire for clothing and food. The gentleman does not speak of them. The ignorant child neglects the mandate of Heaven, and the father should teach and guide him. If the child vaguely understands the mandate of Heaven, he will certainly not contend for the pear. To contend for the pear is to contend for profit. To benefit one's mother is to bless one's mother, which is what is meant by blessing one's family. If one wants to bless one's family, one must first enrich one's parents. Then, are parents not gentlemen? Why must they be prioritized? Because those who are born before me die before me. The pleasures of sound and color, and the desire for clothing and food, are lost before I do. The later-born cannot bear to see them not enjoy them, so they prioritize them. Moreover, parents are those who gave birth to me, raised me, and toiled for me, and they will also die for me. And the benefits of the world cannot be contended for by me, but must be achieved by people themselves. Zhi De first enriches his parents, and the child should not contend for it. The child does not know, so he is stopped. To stop him is to teach him, to guide him.</p>
<p>Huazhang Engraving Company, No. 2 Er Ma Road...</p>
<p>Original Intent of the Question</p>
<p>1. Reason and morality sometimes agree, but sometimes they contradict each other. For example, Ma Zhanshan's initial surrender to Japan was reasonable, while Yue Wumu's acceptance of the false Jin capital was foolish. Adapting to circumstances and not losing virtue is the highest wisdom. The purpose of our company in asking this question is to encourage readers to compare morality and reason from time to time. It is believed that after a draft is completed, three or five like-minded people will gather to discuss it with each other, and these three or five people will gather their friends to discuss it again. Seeing benevolence and seeing wisdom will invisibly provide considerable assistance to academics. 2. This question implies that one should not be dominated by empty names when things are of no help to the world, and should solve them with reason. 3. Even in small matters, one must endure private thoughts and preserve the greater righteousness.</p>
<p>Acknowledgements</p>
<p>After reading your letters, I have summarized three points: seeing benevolence and seeing wisdom are mostly words that benefit the world. Those who criticize it are honest, those who sympathize with its fate are understanding, and those who allow it to do what it can are talented. Good! One question provides three benefits! Gentlemen, you are truly my teachers! The questioner respectfully pays tribute to all the gentlemen with the etiquette of a disciple.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the near future, it is planned to compile all the works and print them into a special publication, dividing them into chapters and sayings in the style of the various schools of thought, and naming them Inquiries or Records of Disciples. It is fortunate that enthusiastic gentlemen will continue to teach us.</p>
<p>Excerpt of Key Sentences</p>
<p>Both Positive and Negative Records</p>
<p>Can the father's body be hidden from the progress of the hull, and can no rescue be applied?</p>
<p>Zhi De's behavior is not righteous, and he is giving away Shield No. 6 to Shi Heng of No. 2 Xilinli</p>
<p>If both father and son cannot be saved, they cannot foolishly sacrifice their lives to avoid despair.</p>
<p>Tang Di, 2nd Company, 2nd Battalion, Military Police Corps giving away Shield No. 8</p>

<p>A filial son encounters misfortune?</p>
<p>Zhang Pu of the Shanghai County Government</p>
<p>In addition, Qiu Zonglu of Daxia University, Shou Zhishang of Jinan University, Zhang Zhenhui of Hualong Elementary School, Yan Ezhao of the Business School, Chen Ting, etc., each received a souvenir badge. The above are positive awards, and the gentlemen below are of profound scholarship and their words are alarming to the world. They all focus on the negative aspects and are each awarded a pure silver badge for literary association as a token of commemoration.</p>
<p>The aftermath of the good words of your honor's titles is that filial piety comes from genuine affection, and admiration and anticipation will last a lifetime, inevitably rushing to the father and slowing down to the son. Seeing her serving her mother with pears and tolerating her son's crying, the pretence is as obvious as the heart. Filial piety towards parents comes first with nourishing their will. Giving away pears is a plan to please the mother, which achieves both aims. How can he not know that it is because of his pretense that he can endure it? Yang Xue of Xingye Lane</p>
<p>〇 In abandoning the father to save the son, he has already incurred the reproach of forgetting his roots and indulging his breath. How can one be a filial son in serving his mother with kindness and sacrificing his small benefits? Ouyang Qian, a kind man, takes the small matter of offering pears to win all the beauties of filial piety, and allows his beloved son to be swollen-eyed in abandoning the great sin of his father. Huan Yang Shenzhai 〇 The above article is limited by economics and cannot quickly show the whole picture, which is truly regrettable for the readers. In addition, Fu Dan Da Min Xiu, Lu of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Yang Lian of the Babao Mountain, Chen Tianyi of Baowei, Wang Yongcai of Tonghe Bank, and Xu Gongquan of the Overseas Chinese Hospital each received a souvenir badge. 〇 The gifts will be sent on the 15th of this month, or it is better to have someone come to collect them. Also, there are many fine works that cannot be listed in detail and will be disclosed as much as possible when the inquiries are published. Fortunately, we prioritize research and scholarship and will not be concerned with fame and fortune.</p>
<p>A Sympathetic Novelist (1)</p>
<p>Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>I laughed with a fellow, “Old Two, aren’t you tired?” Old Two pulled the blue cloth from his body, threw the sickle into the cement, stretched out his back, and sighed “Oh-yo!”, then wiped the sweat on the blue cloth with both hands, the sweat dripping like feathers into the water. Meng Guoshi had a sentence he hadn’t yet said, but a woman slowly walked over, carrying a clay teapot and a rope of wormwood, circling around the teapot’s mouth. The tip of the wormwood was burning with a fragrant smell. This woman was too young, no more than sixteen years old. If she hadn’t tied a round bun on her head and shaved the fine hairs on her temples, one wouldn’t recognize her as a woman, because according to village customs, virgins don’t show their faces. She wore a white cloth jacket and blue cloth pants, but the jacket was trimmed with blue piping all around, and the pants were trimmed with red piping at the cuffs. Although she was a village woman, she seemed to love adornment. Her hair was combed smoothly, with bangs on her forehead, a round face, big black eyes, double eyelids, and long eyelashes. She didn’t need to put on rouge or powder, she was beautiful enough. She walked closer, not noticing the people on the edge of the field, but when Meng Guobao scanned her body, she became a little embarrassed, lowered her head, and took two steps back. Old Two Wang opened his mouth first, smiling at her, “Why did you bring the tea so late? I’m really thirsty.” The woman then slowly stepped forward and handed him the clay teapot and wormwood. She whispered, “Go back to eat earlier, don’t make me wait again.” Old Two Wang had already walked onto the edge of the field, smiling and saying, “I won’t make you wait long today. There’s no one else, and I’m doing it alone. If Mr. Meng hadn’t been standing here chatting with me, I would have rested for lunch a long time ago.” As he spoke, he took down the dry tobacco pouch that was diagonally inserted in his waistband, sat on the grass on the edge of the field, and said to Meng Guobao, “Mr., why don’t you sit down and have a smoke?” But at this time, Meng Guobao’s gaze was fixed on the woman. Although the village woman didn’t understand being shy, she didn’t understand greeting people either. She lowered her head, glanced up, stepped aside, and quietly walked away. Field songs were being sung elsewhere,</p>
<p>“The boy thinks of the girl, and the girl thinks of the boy, separated by the fence, secretly thinking of each other. The boy is tying wheat straw outside the fence, the girl is drying clothes inside the fence. You look at me, and I look at you, forgetting the fragrance of lunch in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>Meng Guobao was listening attentively, watching the young woman walk along the edge of the field and onto the main road. Old Two Wang said, “Mr. Meng, what are you looking at?” Meng Guobao suddenly shrunk his body and laughed, “I didn’t see anything, I heard the cuckoo bird singing nicely.” Old Two Wang held the dry tobacco pouch and puffed out a few mouthfuls of smoke, saying, “How does the cuckoo bird sing?” Meng Guobao pointed to a cluster of green trees, saying, “Isn’t that the bird singing?” Sure enough, there was a bird in the tree, singing very crisply, four words at a time, two sentences each time, sounding very much like saying “Cut wheat, plant rice! Cut wheat, plant rice!” Old Two Wang laughed, “Mr. Meng has lived in the city for a long time, and he will really mistake newly grown wheat for chives in the future. This is the ‘cut rice bird’, why are you calling it a cuckoo bird?” Although Meng Guobao was ridiculed a few times, he didn’t have the time to argue with him, and just smiled and nodded. After a long time, “Who was that just now…” Old Two Wang showed a complacent look, stroked his thigh, and smiled while holding the tobacco pouch, “That’s my cooker, just arrived less than two months ago?” The people in the countryside, when husbands refer to their wives, all call them “cooker”. Since women have had such a term, they have never had any objections, thinking that the wife is the cooker, and the cooker is the wife. Meng Guobao laughed, “It’s not very elegant for us country people to say that about their wives.” Old Two Wang laughed, “Do you want us to call them ‘our lady’ like the people in the city? Wouldn’t that make people laugh their heads off? Old Wang Old Two also has a lady, don’t you think that’s a joke?” So Meng Guobao also laughed. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Movie Supplement - Rare News from the Film Industry</p>
<p>Treatment of Infant Actors</p>
<p>Purple</p>
<p>In movies, we often see infants making guest appearances, don't we? They are not just used as decorations, but their faces are also enlarged on the screen. What methods do directors use to recruit suitable infants when shooting these scenes, and how is their remuneration calculated? This must be something that readers are very interested in knowing.</p>
<p>When Hollywood film companies need infant actors, the most common method is to solicit them from the education bureau in Los Angeles. However, the number of children needed in a film is often more than just one, because the time of appearance is different, and the age of the children cannot but gradually increase. Therefore, companies often solicit more than a dozen children, and they must be of different ages.</p>
<p>Sometimes, companies also often publish advertisements to solicit, in order to save trouble or to arouse others' interest. For example, not long ago, Fox Company solicited an infant who had just been born, specifying that it had to be the first infant born on a certain day. As a result, mothers who were about to give birth all competed hard, and the result was won by one mother. The time of birth was a little after 1:20 am on that day, and the most intense competitor was only a few tens of seconds away from her. Like this, it obviously contains advertising effects.</p>
<p>So, after the infants are recruited, how is their salary calculated? There is usually a fixed price. An infant under 30 days old gets five pounds of gold per day. An infant between 30 and 90 days old gets ten pounds of gold. An infant between nine months and six months old also gets five pounds of gold per day. But the "daily" mentioned here does not mean the "whole day" that we usually mean. If they shoot for two hours, it is considered a day. And the law in California prohibits infants from being continuously filmed for more than 30 seconds at a time, and from being filmed for more than 20 minutes a day.</p>
<p>And the Los Angeles Education Bureau and Health Bureau specifically have all kinds of thoughtful facilities for working infants. Infants under the age of seventeen days are not allowed to work. And in order to protect the health of working infants, they must be examined by doctors from the Health Bureau every day to prevent the spread of diseases.</p>
<p>After hiring an infant, the film company also has to sign a contract, stating what responsibilities the company will take for any accidents that occur during filming, including within six months after work. The contract is signed by the company representative, the education bureau official, and the infant's mother. There are no workers in the United States who receive more comprehensive and perfect protection than the infants who appear in films.</p>
<p>Because of the 20-minute-per-day and 30-second-per-scene limits, directors have to fully prepare the older actors first before calling the infants. At that time, the infants' mothers would have already received notification and be waiting by the telephone at home, ready to come to the set immediately. Therefore, in the director's list, there are often words such as "Eighteen infants waiting for instructions."</p>
<p>Even just waiting like this, the infants' mothers can get two pounds of gold a day.</p>
<p>Small Film Review</p>
<p>Two Subtle Insertions in "Struggle"</p>
<p>Qing Jun</p>
<p>Insert Qing Jun</p>
<p>The value of Lianhua's new film "Struggle" has already been praised in many newspapers today, so there is naturally no need for me to interject. However, I feel that there are two very subtle insertions in the film that the audience may easily overlook, so I dare to bring them up to discuss. As for whether it is as I imagine, please discuss it together.</p>
<p>After Xiao Zheng and Yan Gu are engaged, when Xiao Zheng first gives Yan Gu a beautiful and lovely little bird, and Yan Gu reciprocates with a "great and brave tiger," she lightly draws the character "king" on Xiao Zheng's forehead with the folding fan she is holding in her hand. This is very interesting. However, it is very brief and there is no trace, so viewers are asked to understand it carefully.</p>
<p>Many people think that the four demons in the game field is a very meaningful insertion, but I think there is an insertion within the insertion. That is, Xiao Zheng throws the four demons, and three of them fall in response, but only the "demon of illness" repeatedly misses. This is precisely foreshadowing Yan Gu's later serious illness, indicating that although the hero is strong, he cannot get rid of his lover's illness even when he is promoting momentum for the country.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, there is also a flaw in the film. That is, Xiao Yuan turns from evil to good and sacrifices himself for the country, and the audience also expresses their final sympathy for him; then Mr. Liu should of course ask Xiao Zheng about him, or Xiao Zheng should report this to Mr. Liu. However, the film does not mention this point. Screenwriter, do you also think this is right?</p>

As a result, they did not obtain anything beneficial to us. Since the January 28th Shanghai War, our army's resistance has aroused world sympathy and taught the violent Japanese a lesson. This is sufficient to prove that national affairs must rely on oneself to obtain help from foreigners. It is difficult to predict the future of the League of Nations' discussion of the Sino-Japanese issue, but if we rely on foreigners for help, even if we win, it will be empty.
