<h3 id="c1">五三之回憶彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>今日爲五三慘案紀念。處於風雨飄搖危殆不可終朝之情勢下。尤其處於當前山河破碎敵騎縱横之强權脅迫下。紀念過去之「國難」舊創新痛。併來心頭吾人實深感悲憤沉痛。而末能自已。</p>
<p>五三慘案爆發於民國十七年五月三日。迄今恰爲四週年。其爆發之根因。爲由於我國革命勢力之進展。與北洋舊軍閥之没落。使日帝國主義者深感其勢力範圍之將被打破。而不得不由暗中之阻撓。進而爲直接之武力干涉。故自革命軍第一次北伐。於十六年五月間底定南京時。日本即藉口保僑。悍然出兵山東。爲軍閥張目。迨次年再度北伐。師抵濟南。日本乃更第二次出兵山東。决然實力發動。砲轟濟南。横斷津浦路。殘戮我軍民。而一頁五三慘史乃於。以造成。</p>
<p>五三慘案爆發之意義。在上文吾人已指明其爲對於我國革命之直接鎭壓。吾人尤應認定此爲日帝國主義者企圖長期保有中國廣大之勢力範圍。銷貨塲與原料取給所之必有的手叚。就此當更可把握今日東北禍變與上海禍變之爆發。其意義固不僅在於市塲之重新分割與新戰爭之積極準備。五三慘案之最後結果。爲十九年三月二十四日解决濟案臨時恊定之簽定。協定僅有極其空泛不着實際之條文四欵。而傷心慘目震駭世界之血案。[P停戰會議今晨重開</p>

<p>大陸報云、上海日當局昨日（一日）繼續在法租界與公共租界搜查韓人寓所、而尤注重法租界、因大多數韓人皆旅居該處也、法租界韓人被捕者、共有幾何、詢諸法捕房、不肯實告、被捕實數、昨日未經公布、日當局對於此事、亦無一言、惟聞日領事署警察與日憲兵曾持逮捕狀搜查法租界韓人數十家、男婦均被盤詰、因以被捕者若干人、雖與逮捕狀所開姓名不同、亦不之顧也、公共租界所寓韓人無多、惟聞昨夜亦由日警分往搜查盤詰、有無被捕、未能探悉、昨日謠傅法租界當局因日警窮搜韓僑寓所、援及居者、已向告誡、但此項謠言、未能徴實、</p>

<p>— 王俊芳</p>
<p>民國十七年五月三日。日本大兵開到我們中國的山東省濟南府。殺得同胞鬼哭神號。連外交官蔡公時先生都同歸於死。可怕呀。日本兵殺來。後來經過許多次數的交涉。到了第二年的五月。占據濟南的日本兵才肯撤回。</p>
<p>當那撤兵的時候。一般國人對於前一年日本兵强占濟南殺害同胞的事痛心疾首而起的不平之氣。似乎頓行平了許多。可是我在那個時候。却反起了一種感想。未敢以爲樂觀。因爲當時日本的撤兵。不過臨時交還我國一些管轄山東的主權。依舊隨時可以來占據吾江山。殺害吾同胞的。</p>
<p>「日本兵來了不去是可怕的。去了就不可以再來的嗎。我國國力。有能使得日本兵不再開來的把握嗎。只怕再來起來。不到濟南。要換一塊地方的中國同胞殺殺咧。弄得不好。竟到我們這兒長江口南岸的上海來殺殺也説不定。可想時日本兵的撤與不撤。對於我國國民危險的程度是一様的。爲濟南以外的同胞着想。危險性只有加重些呀」。</p>
<p>我當時雖有過上段所説的一番胡思亂想。過了若干時日。也就淡淡然地忘掉了。不好。到了今年一月廿八日晚上。我以前的胡思亂想。竟不幸而成爲事實。閘北江灣吴淞寳山眞茹南翔太倉大塲黄渡…</p>
<p>……等處上海附近一帶地方的同胞。現在不正是被日本兵燒殺得鬼哭神號。流離失所。所有的一切。都已化爲烏有了嗎。不是比較前五年濟南同胞給日本兵殺害的程度。還要厲害得許多許多嗎。撫今思昔。今天處在目不滬上變亂的環境中間。紀念幾年以前的濟南五三慘案。眞是益發覺得「好不傷感人也」。</p>
<p>細想過去的濟案。現在的滬案。我不免另有幾句話要告訴同胞。以前來過的日本兵去了。現在却是又來了。没有來的（？）他國兵。也可以來的呀。這個理由很簡單。因爲我國目下簡直可以説没有國防。只有「省防」。「省防」祇可用以割據地盤。不可用以抵禦外侮的。我們苦命的老百姓呀。以後應當怎様去和新舊軍閥帝國主義們奮鬥。長保着我中華民族的生機呢。</p>

<p>奇怪的職務倫敦城中。奇怪的職務很多。而最奇怪的要算是望烟囱的一回事了。倫敦市議會中。曾有一種嚴厲的禁令。禁止一切工廠的烟囱中冒出黑烟來。凡有違禁的。一定予以嚴厲的處罰。因此各工廠中。大半僱用着專司望烟囱的人。以免違禁被罰。吉爾西市chwlawa有一座地下鐵道的電力站。特在屋頂上造了一所小屋子。給那望烟囱的人居住在内。不時的走出走進。看望幾個大烟囱。一面拿着一個玻璃的小屏風來。上面共有四種顔色的玻璃。深淺不同。他一見了烟。便從屏風中望去。和那玻璃上的顔色相比較。倘那烟和最深的一種相同時。他就立刻着忙起來。急急按一個電紐。當下鈴聲大震。號角爭鳴。許多辦公室中都現出顔色危險的信號。於是生火間中設法將黑烟厭下去。望烟囱的責任就算盡了。</p>

<p>第五回負義絕交不幸招逢豪客怒關情定策最難消受美人恩梁笑雲把臉色一沈道。你忒看輕我了。怎見得我就不配有好法子呢。也罷。我老實地告訴你罷。這件事不是我吹的話。還的確只有我才能帮你一個大忙。你一向與我交朋友。總算是交著了。不過我也還須替你轉求我的另一朋友才行。葉督軍那裏。他有個最得寵的五太太。在先原是我最要好的姊妹。你若想在葉督軍手下作事。用不著投考講武堂。轉那麽大的灣子。只消我去與你通個内線。向五太太提一提。由伊在葉督軍面前。保荐你一下。准就有一封現成的委任狀發下來。差事也准比連排長大得多。往後有了這進身之階。再繼續運動的得法。成一點新隊伍。當一員高級帶兵官。也不算難。你看。我替你想的這條門路。該不錯吧。安玉田沈吟著道。這條門路當然是很好。只可惜有此不大光明和不正當。但你這番好意。我總是感激的。如今一般志士們。謀事都不必擇手段。我也就顧不得那許多了。可是你向五太太跟前去保舉我。究該怎樣措詞。又將你我説成是怎樣的關係呢。梁笑雲胸中雖有成竹。却没料到安玉田會傻頭傻腦的自已這樣問上來。一時倒不便怎生回答。就仍冷笑著道。這就要先問你自已了。説罷。忽有一個娘姨走進來。説晚飯預備好啦。梁笑雲吩咐開到臥房裏面來吃。立時就又端進一桌最可口的家常便飯。安玉田今天還是半點水米未曾進肚。又有梁笑雲那麽殷勤相勸。就不免放懷飽餐了一頓。飯後。在房中來回踱著方步。想起梁笑雲剛才反問他的那一句話。實是在可解與不可解之間。忍不住還要問個明白。就涎著臉説道。你見了五太太。説你我是朋友。或是親戚。成不成呢。梁笑雲坐在床邊。櫻唇上含著一枝香烟。也彷彿在刻意思量什麽。及聽安玉田仍然似那麽裝傻。便淡淡的説道。還是你自已打算罷。横堅我已决計帮你的忙。我的心你又不是不知道的。請你且寛坐一會兒。我們在飯後先找點樂子消遣消遣罷。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前日疊接方君來函三封，一封是給史量才先生的，一封是給總主筆先生的，一封是給本刋主編的，兩封是掛號，</p>
<p>一封是平信，面所開是方鈍厂，信内署名却是大衆一份子，三書的内容，完全是一樣，他所不贊成而攻擊本刋之點，大致有二，</p>
<p>一大衆文藝不贊成舊式詩，</p>
<p>一大衆科學離開大衆太遠，</p>
<p>至於方君一日連寄三書，是否尙有别種作用，我不得而知，并無此精神與暇晷去加以探討，惟方君指示兩點，我也承認與大衆二字，的確有些不合，不過我所以如此編輯之理由與其經過，不得不約略言之，并與一般讀者諸君和投稿諸君一商榷焉，</p>
<p>當本刋改革之初，本想把本刋的内容，完全用民衆化，文字，採取明白易解的文字，科學，亦取切實而關於普通應用者，此原改革本刋的初志也，其實科學二字，早已有些不妥，據梁任公説，</p>
<p>「根據經騐的事實分析綜合求出一個最近眞的公例，以推論同類事物，這種學問呌做「科學」，應用科學改變出來的物質，或建設出來的機械等等，只能謂之科學的結果不能與「科學」本身併爲一談，」</p>
<p>任公這樣的解釋，是否允當，我不得而知，因爲他所解釋科學名詞的意義，近似邏輯之學，邏輯原是理推之學，一切法之法，一切學之學，其功用亦是如此，這個問題，自有博學多聞者加以討論，我且不管，但是試行一月以來，</p>
<p>文藝則採取白話詩（所謂新詩是也）與白話文，科學亦採較易行而切於實用者，</p>
<p>但不侫仔細選來，新詩新文之中，確也有幾篇富於美術意味的文字，但並不多見，而隨便描寫幾句，並不深刻的，也屬不少，并且文藝二字的界説，更爲困難，若以廣義言之，本刋内所載的文字，無一篇無文藝的價値，若以狹義言之，那一篇有文藝的價値，那樣文字才算有文藝的價値，連我也不得而知，</p>
<p>至於科學，本來是專門的學問，大衆不來的，并且投稿家所投之稿，多是研究各種物質的原理原則，而不大切於實用者居多，而欲合乎大衆二字宗旨的，殊難其選，</p>
<p>老實説句話·本刋的編輯者，非但對於科學是門外漢，即對於文藝二字，</p>
<p>是一知半解，莫名其妙的，全仗幾位投稿的先生們，天天替我帮忙，不侫已深爲感激，不過本刋篇幅有限，并且自戰事發生以後，陣綫更是縮短，未能儘量登載，這是不侫所引爲抱歉的，（未完）</p>

<p>— 乃徴</p>
<p>機關槍在陸軍軍械中佔極重要的地位，因爲牠携帶輕便，射彈又速，防守衝鋒兩方面都有極大的功用·</p>
<p>機關槍可以分爲槍身，槍機，裝彈機，連發機，脚架數部份·但牠的用處不同，所以近世有五種機關槍，今分述於下··</p>
<p>（一）重機關槍射發速度每分鐘是四百發至七百發，須要三人或四人管理，但最近美國新式重機關槍，二人即可開放。要搬運牠，大概用馬或車，但亦有用人扛的。牠的射擊距離（即射程）可逹一萬三千英尺，在一萬英尺以内最有力·日本軍隊用的三年式機關槍就是這種·　　（二）輕機關槍發射速度是每分鐘五百發至八百發·二人即可開放，射程與重機關槍差不多，但在七千英尺内較有力·歐戰時第一年即發明得較好的效力·後即極力提倡，成爲步兵的主要軍器·依照國軍的編制，每團有機關槍連一連·其重要可知。輕機關槍最輕的祇有二十二磅，約合我國秤十六斤半，携帶非常便利·故衝鋒時都用牠，但前面講的重機關槍大都用於防守上·</p>
<p>（三）手提機關槍則嬌小玲瓏，重量更輕，大約祗有十三四斤，一人即能開放，不用時如步槍一樣的托於肩上。槍管爲五種中最短，故射程亦最短·但牠輕而便於開放，容易命中敵人，在平常距離中其力亦甚猛，故我國軍界大人物的衛待，皆用手提機關槍。</p>
<p>（四）飛機機關槍是有裝在飛機上的，亦有載在飛機上的，用來向下掃射，或在空中互相射擊。重量射程與輕機關槍相同，而發射速率每分一千三百餘發·再有一種雙管的，可以同時射發，更加猛烈。</p>
<p>（五）高射機關槍·用來射擊飛機，牠裝在一種架上，槍口向上，槍管與平面成四十五度角至九十度角（直角），在這度數内可以任意高下，並能旋轉。牠的槍管在五種中算最長，所以牠的射程極遠，約可逹一萬五千餘尺，在一萬尺内可以射穿飛機的身體·因牠連續發彈一分鐘内可六百發，子彈眞如聯珠一般的飛，若飛機給牠射中，則起碼必須吃着五顆。至於牠的附件，尙有反射瞄準器。</p>
<p>機關槍的發射力猛烈，速率甚快，槍膛緊長，不斷飛出的子彈的磨擦力，生成極大的熱度。故必須使牠冷却·否則必致槍膛融裂的·舊式的槍膛，外面再有一層空隙，中儲冷水或别種液體，必須時時更換，但熱力大時能使水沸騰，少頃即乾·故倘若遇着荒土的沙塲無水，非常不便，故近來都改用空氣冷却法，可以免去此弊。</p>

<p>— 白匋</p>
<p>一月二十八日之後，我軍與日軍戰，屢戰屢勝，而且有好幾回打下敵人的司令部來。這其間有許多可泣可歌的英勇故事。</p>
<p>當戰事暴發的時候，打得最劇烈的地方，要算天通庵。因爲天通庵逼近敵人的司令部，我軍和敵人在這里曾肉搏了好幾回，屢得屢失，屢失屢得！後來，敵人不惜傾全力來攻打，</p>
<p>那時形勢十分危急，我軍中有兵士五人，一躍而出，請願長官，願爲敢死隊以破敵。官長允許了他們的請求。替他們拍了照，敎他們各人寫好遺囑。於是，每人胸前掛上一粒大炸彈，背上背了一箱汽油。號令一下，就拼命的向敵人的司令部衝去，後面只跟着少數兵士。這五個英勇的兵士衝進敵人的司令部，立刻炸彈爆發，火骨焚身，敵人不備，以爲我大軍殺來，嚇得魂不附體，丢下槍械就溜之大吉。於是我軍大勝，轉危爲安。</p>
<p>可惜這五個兵士没有留下英名來，至今追念英雄悲憤交集！</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>每天都一樣，還是睡在床上，便聽着賣報的喚賣。一種單純的「申報新聞報……時事新報……時報」，由遠及近，再由濃重漸至稀薄。但是昨天絕早的晨光，在春睡的朦朧中，我却聽着「高朗的喚聲，却是不同」……簡直使我也興奮起來了。</p>
<p>「娘姨！」我喊着··「趕快去買一份申報來·</p>
<p>本來我可以到辦公處去看，然而那是太遲了。</p>
<p>「先生！十六個銅板。」娘姨拿着報紙回來説··</p>
<p>「噢？爲什麽這樣貴呢？」</p>
<p>「我也不知道哩，可是他説（今天要賣得貴些，你不要有别人要），提起脚馬上跑，………」</p>
<p>「是的是的，我懂得了·」因爲是急於要讀，所以也不願和她嚕囌了。</p>
<p>果然，報紙上是於最顯眼的地位登載了這一消息，而且還是繪身繪色的，極盡描寫之能事。</p>
<p>眞的，這是値得記載的驚人消息，否則報販怎麽能夠大賺其錢呢？就是我自已也顚誠的對那人肅然起敬！</p>
<p>其後在辦公處的電車中，我又得拜聽各種中國人的高談妙論··</p>
<p>「可惜没有XX」這是一紳士式的中年人慨嘆的説。接上是一個老太婆接着説··</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛！」</p>
<p>「可是我們中國連半個也没有；哎」！你想？這是一個小商人憂鬱的説。然而他立刻遭受着對面坐的學生所給他鄙獰的冷眼，似乎是説，「你爲什麽不去試試看呢？」於是那商人只好低下頭來，默默地。忽然一個短衣的强有力的青年，也加入了他們的談話，</p>
<p>電車在不知不覺中到了目的地，於是我也就怱忙走下車去，到底没有聽着那青年的結論，</p>
<p>唉！</p>

<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>我家住屋的隔壁，是一爿日本人開設的芦野理髮店；門面裝璜得十分地的考究，因此可以時時聽見那扇玻璃彈簧門在「嘰哩加拉」地作響！大有應接不暇之勢。照我所曉得的，店老閶所聘理髮師中有一個呌做金鼎三的朝鮮人；除正式工作外，眞好像「能者多勞」的要人們還要兼差··「買辦東西，迎送顧客。</p>
<p>每天早上，金鼎三照例的是要去虹口小菜塲買菜，而店主嬌生慣養的那隻烏雲蓋雪的狗，也得照例亦步亦趨地跟着他去觀光小菜塲。他每次走到我家門前，若是是見了我的小弟弟，他絕不放過機會的要和他戲要一會，他常説·」·小寳寳，怪可愛呢！」可是不知怎的？他對於小東人却不很歡喜，有時也公然見他抱着小東人，但他總有幾分似乎迫於應命不得不然的顔色表現着。</p>
<p>不幸霹靂一聲，閘北無情的砲火，震天澈地價響個不住，兆豐路一帶的居民，頓時演成了一幕慘淡憂懼的悲劇。　　芦野理髮店的老闆，爲了華人一致抗日的敵愾心，存很大的戒意，除將大玻璃櫉窗外警備了鐵栅和木板，自已還深壁高壘地躱着從不敢輕於一現。但是所謂「日本大帝國發揚國威一老闆自嗚得意的哈哈笑聲，常和着隆隆的槍砲聲由壁裏縫間，不斷地送過我家來！　　後來戰事吃緊，日僑—尤其朝鮮台灣人，大都被派着去充當便衣偵探隊，素以「絕對服從」爲天職的金鼎三，自然不得不一勞大駕而代店老闆去幹這種自已所不願意幹的貴幹－便衣隊！當他一個人垂頭喪氣的走店門快去XX司令部報到的時候，只有那隻不知時務的」烏雲蓋雪」的狗，依然踉踉蹌蹌地追着出來，可是終於被店東太太發覺，趕快跑來把牠抱了踅回去。</p>
<p>慘淡凄暗的月兒，疎疎動搖的星光，一片片的戰雲，和那戰場健兒呌「殺」之聲齊犇；槍彈砲子造成了滿天紅螢，一陣陣的陰風，帶來了負傷悲痛的呼聲！一天的拂曉，重重濃霧籠罩中的一座橋端，隠隠約約地有個衣衫檻褸打拌成難民模樣的人，正在閃躱探望着；不料樹着隨風飄展的青白旗的橋的另一端，猛然站起幾個精神抖抖的兵士，一致向他瞄準，并大聲問道··「什麽人」？那人大概是「初出馬門」的吧！一時慌張了便向後轉跑，只聞「砰」的一聲，那人便應聲而倒，這幾個兵士爭先恐後的奔近他去，只見他一面在血泊中掙扎打滾，一面在斷斷續續地操一口很生澀的上海白説··「這·一·」……來…我才感受到我們的生命。連一隻「烏雲蓋雪」的狗都不如呀！我的仇敵，到底還是我的仇敵……」最後他長嘆出一聲「ＸＸ」來，就一動也不動了。</p>

<p>The Recollections of the May Third</p>
<p>Today is the memorial of the May Third Tragedy. Under the situation of being in a precarious state like a boat tossed by wind and rain, especially under the current situation of broken mountains and rivers and the oppression of strong powers with enemy cavalry running rampant, commemorating the past "national crisis" brings fresh pain to mind. We deeply feel sadness and grief, and cannot help ourselves.</p>
<p>The May Third Tragedy broke out on May 3, 1928. It has been exactly four years to this day. The root cause of its outbreak was due to the progress of China's revolutionary forces and the decline of the old Northern Warlords, which made Japanese imperialism deeply feel that its sphere of influence was about to be broken. It had no choice but to move from secret obstruction to direct military intervention. Therefore, since the first Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, when Nanjing was settled in May of 1927, Japan, under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese, brazenly sent troops to Shandong to support the warlords. When the second Northern Expedition arrived in Jinan the following year, Japan then sent troops to Shandong for the second time, resolutely launching its strength, bombing Jinan, cutting off the Jinpu Railway, and slaughtering our soldiers and civilians. Thus, a page of the May Third Tragedy was created.</p>
<p>The significance of the outbreak of the May Third Tragedy has been pointed out by us in the previous article as a direct suppression of our country's revolution. We should also recognize that this is a necessary tactic of Japanese imperialism to attempt to maintain its vast sphere of influence in China, its sales market, and its raw material supply location in the long term. From this, we can better grasp the significance of the outbreaks of the Northeastern Incident and the Shanghai Incident today. Its significance is not only in the re-division of the market and the active preparation for new wars. The final result of the May Third Tragedy was the signing of the temporary agreement to resolve the Jinan Incident on March 24, 1930. The agreement only had four extremely vague and impractical clauses, but it was a bloody case that was heartbreaking, tragic, and shocked the world.</p>
<h3 id="e1">[P] Ceasefire Conference Reopens This Morning <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Meeting to sign draft agreement at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Formal signing scheduled for tomorrow</p>
<p>Working group concludes meeting yesterday on location issue</p>
<p>The ceasefire conference, which has been stalled for three weeks, has now been decided to reopen this morning at 10 a.m. at the British Consulate General. The ceasefire agreement has been finalized after a full day of sorting out yesterday. The conference can be reopened this morning to sign the draft agreement. Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi told our reporter last night that the ceasefire agreement is expected to be formally signed on Thursday and fully announced on Saturday. The issue of the temporary stationing locations of Chinese and Japanese troops was resolved at the military subcommittee meeting last night. After the agreement is signed, a joint committee will be organized to verify the withdrawal of troops by both sides. The joint committee will be composed of Chinese and Japanese civil and military representatives, together with the Consuls General of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy in Shanghai and the military attachés of the four countries. Our representative, Vice Minister Guo, has stated that he will no longer serve.</p>
<h3 id="e2">[P] Draft Agreement Signed This Morning <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The ceasefire conference has been stalled since the 11th of last month due to the negotiations on the deadline for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops reaching a deadlock. Recently, after an informal meeting passed the compromise plan of British Minister Lampson, and the Special Committee of the League of Nations Council also passed a resolution, the ceasefire conference here took a sharp turn for the better. The military subcommittee resolved the issue of the defensive locations of Chinese troops in Pudong and south of the Suzhou Creek last night. The official ceasefire conference decided to reopen this morning at 10 a.m. At that time, the subcommittee will submit a formal report, which will be approved by the conference. Chinese, Japanese, and Allied representatives can then sign the draft ceasefire agreement. Our representatives at this morning's meeting are still Vice Foreign Minister Guo Taiqi, Shanghai Garrison Commander Dai Ji, and Chief of Staff Huang Qiang of the 19th Route Army. The Japanese representatives, Commander Ueda and Minister Shigemitsu, have not recovered from their injuries and cannot attend. It has been decided that Second Secretary Okazaki of the Japanese Embassy will represent Shigemitsu, and the military representatives will be Japanese Chief of Staff Tashiro and Naval Chief of Staff Shimada. The Allied representatives are still British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, French Minister Wilden, and Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano. The original text of the agreement is in Chinese, English, and Japanese, and the English version will be the standard in case of any dispute. The Chinese and Japanese sides completed the final proofreading and sorting yesterday until late at night.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Formal Signing Tomorrow Ceasefire Agreement <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The date of the formal signing of the ceasefire agreement must be finalized at this morning's meeting. However, because the British Minister has decided to fly north on Friday morning to conclude his mission in Peiping and return home, the formal signing is scheduled for tomorrow. Our representatives signing will still be Vice Minister Guo, Commander Dai, and Chief of Staff Huang. In addition to Tashiro and Shimada, it is still questionable whether Ueda and Shigemitsu, who have not recovered from their bombing injuries, can sign. However, the Japanese side still hopes that Shigemitsu and Ueda can sign in their hospital beds to reward their efforts. Otherwise, Consul General Murai will replace Minister Shigemitsu. As for the ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and the Italian Chargé d'Affaires, they will also sign in a row. After the agreement is signed, the joint committee will begin to be organized. The candidates for the joint committee have already been decided to be one civil and one military official each from China, Japan, and the four Allied countries participating in the conference. Vice Minister Guo has already stated that he will no longer serve, and British Minister Lampson is also eager to return home. Therefore, the Allied side will be represented by British Consul General John Brennan, American Consul General Cunningham, French Consul General Meyrier, Italian Consul General Ciano, and the military attachés of the four countries. Our side may be represented by Mayor Wu Tiecheng and Chief of Staff Huang. The Japanese side may be represented by Consul General Murai and Chief of Staff Tashiro. The authority of the joint committee is to verify the withdrawal of both sides. Although the final date of the Japanese army's withdrawal still needs to be decided temporarily, the deadline for the first step of the Japanese army's withdrawal to the area bordering the Public Concession has been set to begin within one week after the signing of the agreement and to be completed within four weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Yesterday, China, Japan, and the Allied countries made contact twice <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Although all parties involved in the ceasefire conference are eager to complete it as soon as possible, the two sides are still in a deadlock regarding the issue of the stationing of Chinese troops south of Suzhou Creek and in Pudong. British Minister Lampson, because this matter is not resolved, the conference will also be affected. Therefore, last Saturday, he ordered Military Attaché Sandilands to negotiate everything with Japanese representative Tashiro. Yesterday morning at 11 a.m., he also negotiated with our representatives Huang Qiang and Guo Dehua. Yesterday, in addition to the British Attaché, American Attaché Tressider, Italian Attaché Farattini, and French Attaché Pennavayre also participated. The British Attaché stated that the Japanese side's opinion on the stationing of Chinese troops along the line from Pudong Lan Ni Du to Zhang Jia Lou and on the south bank of Suzhou Creek is that Chinese troops should not be stationed in this area. They also stated that if Chinese troops are stationed, the Japanese side will send troops to Pudong to dispatch sentries to defend themselves. There will also be considerable deployments on the Suzhou Creek. It is hoped that the Chinese side will make concessions. Our representatives were unwilling to discuss it, and the meeting ended at 11:35 a.m. without any results. Our representatives and neutral representatives continued to negotiate at 4 p.m. The British Attaché put forward a compromise plan, that is, in the minutes of the meeting, our side stated that there were no troops stationed in Pudong. Although our side had troops stationed in the Longhua and Xin Zhuang area south of Suzhou Creek, we agreed with the Japanese side not to advance and that neither side should take hostile actions. Our side expressed that this could be accepted, and the meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The British Attaché's compromise solution was accepted by our side at the small group meeting last night <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>After the British Attaché's compromise solution was accepted by our side, representatives from China, Japan, and related countries held a formal small group meeting at 6 p.m. yesterday. The Japanese representatives were Tashiro, Nishimura, Abe, and Kajiwara. The British Attaché presided over the meeting and negotiated the new plan, which was unanimously passed. The documents discussed at the meeting were then reorganized, and the meeting adjourned at 8:10 p.m. The subcommittee then concluded.</p>
<p>[P] Press Release of the Subcommittee</p>
<p>The military subcommittee issued a press release last night stating that the military subcommittee has completed the matter submitted by the conference for discussion at today's meeting and will formally report it to the conference tomorrow.</p>
<p>[P] Various Organizations Oppose the Sino-Japanese Ceasefire Negotiations</p>
<p>In the midst of the negotiations, the Japanese side suddenly put forward the so-called demand that Chinese troops should never be stationed in Nanshi and Pudong. Our representatives, at the request of the British Minister, telegraphed Nanjing for instructions, believing that this was an insult to the country and a loss of sovereignty. They sent an urgent telegram to Nanjing yesterday to express their opposition. The telegram read: "Urgent to Premier Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Chairman Chiang of the Military Council, and Minister Luo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The League of Nations is discussing the Shanghai case at the request of our country. Now Japan has repeatedly stated that it is not bound by the resolutions of the League of Nations. If we give in to the Japanese army, how can we face the League of Nations in the future? Moreover, the Japanese side put forward the so-called demand that no troops should be stationed in Nanshi and Pudong at the time when the agreement is about to be concluded. Our representatives telegraphed Nanjing for instructions at the request of the British Minister, which can be said to be the ultimate insult to the country. All the people of Shanghai, except for the rich who have become traitors, are vowing to oppose it to the death. If the government accepts such unreasonable demands, it will be cutting itself off from the people and cutting off its own life. Shanghai Associations United for National Salvation, respectfully."</p>
<p>[L] Various Organizations United Call for Publication of the Agreement Content</p>
<p>The United Association for National Salvation believes that the agreement on the Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference has been sorted out and will be signed soon. The public needs to have the agreement published. Yesterday, it sent a special representative, Yin Zhiling, to the Foreign Affairs Office at 3 p.m. to meet with Vice Minister Guo. Vice Minister Guo was out, so Secretary Deng Zhongying received him on his behalf. Representative Yin immediately stated his intention, requesting that the agreement that has been sorted out be fully published. Secretary Deng immediately replied that the content of the agreement is not much different from what has been announced in the newspapers. Therefore, the diplomacy handled in Shanghai this time has taken an absolutely open attitude. The office is responsible for publishing the meeting situation and results to the press every night after each meeting. Therefore, there is really no secret in the agreement, and I hope that all sectors will not have any doubts. As for the request of the representative, it will be forwarded to Representative Guo. Next, Yin said that it is hoped that the words "comply with the League of Nations resolution" will be added to each clause to prevent the Japanese side from failing to comply in the future. Deng replied that this is really unnecessary. Because the Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal conference was opened based on the League of Nations resolution. If the Japanese side still violates the treaty after signing, the Japanese side will be responsible for violating the League of Nations resolution. It is not necessary to add the words "comply with the League of Nations resolution" to each clause. Moreover, if the Japanese side intends to destroy the alliance regardless, it will not be able to restrain its destructive actions by this number. Representative Yin was satisfied and then left.</p>

<p>▲ Remove the International Conspiracy</p>
<p>▲ Establish Neutral Locations</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Telegraphic Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency): Taking advantage of the opportunity of the Japanese bombing incident, the idea of establishing a neutral zone in Shanghai is becoming more and more of a problem. If the current situation continues, Shanghai will be the center of international conspiracy. From the perspective of not being able to remove the anxiety of the people in and out of Shanghai, the Japanese Central Military Department will call for the responsibility of the Chinese government in the round table meeting after the establishment of the ceasefire negotiations, and will advocate effective and pertinent proposals to make them realized. Therefore, it is generally noted.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reported that the army's main department discussed the countermeasures for the Shanghai bombing incident and resolved as follows: (1) The incident is not without doubts about the ceasefire agreement, but the issue of the signing will be handled separately. (2) Before the signing, the truth of the incident will be determined. If there is evidence that the Chinese side planned and instigated it, an appropriate expression of intent should be made.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Injuries of Important Japanese Figures <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Treatment Progresses Well</p>
<p>Dr. Goto Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the bombing injuries of important Japanese military and political figures, the treatment has progressed well in recent days. Although the right eye of Admiral Nomura, Commander of the Third Japanese Fleet, has become blind, it is hoped that the left eye can be preserved. Shirakawa, Ueda, Murai, and others have all shown great improvement. Minister Shigemitsu, on the other hand, has more injuries. The shrapnel in his right knee joint was finally removed by surgery yesterday afternoon after many attempts. He could not sleep due to the pain. The Japanese government specially sent Dr. Goto Shichiro, the authority in the Japanese surgical field and the head of the surgical department of Kyushu Imperial University Hospital, to Shanghai to treat the bombing victims. He arrived in Shanghai on a warship at 5:30 p.m. yesterday and went to the Fukumin Hospital to examine the injuries of Minister Shigemitsu and Consul General Murai. It has been decided to perform surgery on Shigemitsu today to remove the shrapnel. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>[P] Shirakawa and Ueda Unchanged</p>
<p>According to a statement from the Japanese military hospital yesterday, Commander Shirakawa had a slight fever in the afternoon of the 1st, which subsided in the middle of the night. On the morning of the 2nd, his temperature was normal. Because he had enough sleep, his spirits were still good. The treatment of the wound is progressing well and there should be no other diseases. He ate soup, porridge, and milk for lunch and drank a little white wine on the morning of the 2nd. Commander Ueda had a fever in the afternoon of the 1st, which subsided in the evening. The amount of sleep is gradually increasing. He naturally defecated and urinated on the morning of the 2nd. The wound has not changed. He ate porridge and digestible food and drank one go of Japanese sake at noon on the 2nd. He was talking and laughing freely.</p>

<p>According to a statement from Fukumin Hospital yesterday regarding the injuries of Shigemitsu and Murai, Minister Shigemitsu's wound has not changed from the previous day. He drank milk porridge and other digestible foods, but the pain in the wound was unbearable, which hindered sleep. The cough has decreased. At 11 a.m. on the 2nd, his body temperature was 38.6 degrees, his pulse was 104, and his respiration was 30. At 4 p.m., his body temperature was 38.5 degrees, his pulse was 102, and his respiration was 30. Consul General Murai's treatment is progressing very well and the wound has not changed. He is already able to sit up and eat ordinary food. At 11 a.m. on the 2nd, his body temperature was 37.2 degrees, his pulse was 86, and his respiration was 23. At 4 p.m., his body temperature was 37.2 degrees, his pulse was 80, and his respiration was 24.</p>

<p>At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, Major Kawata, a military doctor, and Tonomiya Hiroshi, the director of Fukumin Hospital, performed surgery on Minister Shigemitsu in an attempt to remove the shrapnel in the bones of his right knee joint. After two hours of effort, it was eventually suspended due to various difficulties.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Nomura's Left Eye Can Be Preserved <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>According to a statement from the Japanese Naval Hospital regarding the injury of Admiral Nomura, Commander of the Third Fleet, Nomura slept very well on the night of the 1st. He had a slight fever after the surgery on his right eye, but there was no pain. His body temperature was 36.7 degrees on the morning of the 2nd and 36.6 degrees in the afternoon. His left eye is already normal and can be preserved.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Dr. Goto Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Goto Shichiro, the authority in the Japanese surgical field, major general in the army medical corps, and head of the surgical department of Kyushu Imperial University Hospital, was ordered by the Japanese government to come to Shanghai to treat the injured personnel. He arrived in Shanghai on a warship at 5:30 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by Watanabe Tokushichi, a second lieutenant in the army medical corps. He landed at the Osaka Pier and went to Fukumin Hospital by car. He first had a 30-minute meeting with Tonomiya to discuss the injuries of Shigemitsu and Murai in detail.

<h3 id="e15">Foreigners Discuss the Arrest of Ahn Chang-ho <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>▲ Political Prisoners Protected</p>
<p>▲ French Concession Still Extradited</p>
<p>Since the bombing at Hongkou Park, because the perpetrator was the Korean Yoon Bong-gil, Korean residents in Shanghai were the first to bear the brunt. More than ten Koreans living in the French Concession were arrested in one day. Among them, the arrest of Korean revolutionary leader Ahn Chang-ho and his reckless extradition to the Japanese military headquarters with the permission of the French police was particularly noticed by the world. Our reporter met a political scholar from a certain country yesterday to discuss the arrest of Mr. Ahn. According to him, Mr. Ahn is a political prisoner and should receive full international protection. Even if he is suddenly arrested, in law, after careful research, if there are no other special criminal acts, extradition is impossible. Moreover, there are clear provisions in international conventions and laws protecting political prisoners. In other words, it is also to maintain the dignity and prestige of an independent country. Assuming that Country A arbitrarily arrests political prisoners in Country B's territory, and even takes the prisoners back and punishes them without authorization, then Country B should be a vassal of Country A or a territory of Country A, etc.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese military authorities and consular police are still keeping the investigation into the Hongkou Park bombing case a secret. However, according to Japanese sources, it is now believed that this act was committed by the Korean Communist Party. In the past two days, Japanese police have cooperated with the French police and successively searched ten places. Including Yoon Bong-gil, who was arrested on the spot at Hongkou Park, a total of 20 people have been arrested. However, it is said that Li Chunshan, who instructed the case, has not yet been arrested. It is expected that the search will continue. Rumor has it that several Russians have been arrested in the French Concession, which has been firmly denied by the French police. According to Japanese sources, Yoon Bong-gil has confessed that Li Chunshan gave him 200 yuan and two bombs and asked him to act. It was then discovered by the Japanese police that Li Chunshan was a well-known Communist Party member in Harbin who had been in Shanghai for a short time. He called himself Li Youpei in Shanghai and served as the chairman of the Goryeo Independence Alliance. It is not known where he is hiding at the moment, but the Japanese police expect to arrest him soon. Among the people arrested this time, Ahn Chang-ho has been engaged in revolution for 40 years and is the most important figure in the independence movement. However, the Japanese police claimed that Mr. Ahn was arrested before the bombing on Friday morning because the Japanese court had issued a warrant for his arrest before he came to Shanghai from the United States. However, the Japanese authorities now believe that Mr. Ahn has little to do with the bombing case. Mr. Ahn has a wife and three children, all of whom are currently in the United States. As for the other arrested persons, the Japanese authorities have made no statement, only stating that several Chinese arrested in Hongkou Park after the bombing have been released. It is now heard that the Japanese military authorities have announced martial law in Wusong. Anyone going to Song from both land and water must be strictly searched before being allowed to enter the country. In the entire area of Zhabei, sentries have been added to all important intersections, and any Chinese who look suspicious will be searched.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st) continued to search the residences of Koreans in the French Concession and the Public Concession, and paid particular attention to the French Concession, because most Koreans live there. How many Koreans have been arrested in the French Concession? When asked to the French police, they refused to tell the truth. The actual number of arrests was not announced yesterday. The Japanese authorities also made no statement on this matter. However, it was heard that the police of the Japanese Consulate and the Japanese military police had searched dozens of Korean homes in the French Concession with arrest warrants. Men and women were interrogated, and some of those arrested were not those whose names were on the arrest warrants. There are not many Koreans living in the Public Concession, but it was heard that the Japanese police also went to search and interrogate them last night. Whether anyone was arrested is unknown. It was rumored yesterday that the French Concession authorities had warned the Japanese police for their exhaustive search of the Korean residents' residences and their involvement with residents, but this rumor could not be verified.</p>

<p>Regarding the rumor that the rear office of the 19th Route Army stationed in Shanghai has been closed, our reporter met Wang Zhiyuan, the director of propaganda of the office yesterday. According to him, no order to close has been received recently. However, because the affairs are becoming simpler day by day, the office staff will be appropriately reduced and the scope will be reduced. The rumor may be a mistake about this. After the ceasefire agreement is signed, the military period will be over, and the office must of course be closed. Now it is engaged in editing the war history of the army's resistance against Japan and collecting materials, which takes a lot of time. Therefore, it can only be completely closed after at least two months.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Postal Workers Union and Postal Employees Union Propose Concrete Plans to Consolidate Postal Foundations <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>—Temporarily Maintain Existing Rates—</p>
<p>—Abolish the Savings and Remittance General Office—</p>
<p>—Cease Payment of Aviation Subsidies—</p>
<p>—Safeguard Employee Economics—</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers Union and the Postal Employees Union, in order to consolidate the postal foundation and seek positive development of postal affairs, have presented concrete outlines and requested the Ministry of Communications to adopt and implement them. The original text is as follows: "Presenting a request to temporarily maintain the existing postal rates, abolish redundant organizations, and establish the principle of supporting the postal service with its own revenue, so as to benefit the people. It is noted that China's communications undertakings have been repeatedly affected by political turmoil, leading to near collapse. The postal service, with its remarkable achievements, is able to maintain itself because it is detached from political turmoil. However, since the recovery of postal management rights, it has gradually been dominated by the environment and lost its independent position. Postal reserve funds and remittances, which are guaranteed, are not managed by postal personnel with guaranteed employment and established credibility, but are controlled by figures who come and go with political tides. Economically, at first, most of the operating expenses were required to be fully borne by the postal service. Subsequently, funds earmarked for construction and development were withdrawn. Then, a redundant savings and remittance agency was established, increasing postal expenditures. Further, due to the establishment of airline companies, postal funds were further depleted, increasing the postal burden. The postal foundation has been shaken. At the same time, natural disasters and foreign aggressions have struck heavily. The postal service, which had been operating with a surplus for decades, has reported losses. Consequently, in order to make up for the shortage of the postal budget, the postal rates were resolutely increased by 50 percent, and even by two or three times. The Ministry considers the postal service as a public utility, with the state merely acting as an agent. Currently, due to natural disasters and man-made calamities, the budget is insufficient, and the national treasury is unable to provide subsidies. The only way is to increase postal rates, take from the people, and use it for the people, which can be sustained. The employees' unions greatly admire the Ministry's hard work in safeguarding the postal service and its principle of acting as an agent. However, the Ministry has not been able to fully investigate the existing sources of disease in the postal service, and the treatment is only aimed at the symptoms, leading to much debate and public alarm. The employees' unions, as the central hub for the will of all postal employees, feel obliged to uphold the Ministry's intention to safeguard the postal service, gather the opinions of postal employees across the country, logically compile statistics, conduct in-depth research, and propose a plan. If the Ministry could adopt it, the foundation of the postal service could be stabilized, the burden on the people could be lightened, and the welfare of the people could be improved. This would not only be a hundred-year undertaking. We hereby present the outline of the plan and attach the reasons, requesting the Ministry to review and implement it. Over 30,000 postal employees are awaiting orders with utmost urgency. Respectfully presented to the Minister of Communications [and] Vice Minister."</p>
<p>Plan Outline (Outline refers to principles, items refer to methods): Outline 1: The principle of using postal revenue to support the postal service as the overall principle of the plan, to solidify the postal foundation. Outline 2: Abolish the Postal Savings and Remittance General Office and its branch offices in Hankou and Nanjing, restore the original postal organization, and continue to have the postal service manage savings and remittance businesses, improve effectiveness, and save expenses to comply with the central government's intention to streamline. Outline 3: Temporarily maintain existing postal rates, but stop allocating funds from the postal service to the China and Eurasia Airlines, to reduce the postal burden, compensate for postal losses, and solidify the economic foundation of the postal service. Item 1: If the Postal General Office has a surplus, in addition to setting aside 10 percent for employee pensions and 20 percent for the postal fund for preparation against natural disasters, the rest shall be used by the post office to fully fund postal construction and development. The Ministry of Communications shall not withdraw it. Item 2: The original personnel system and treatment guarantees of the postal service should be effectively maintained. Deputy directors and below, except for a few secretaries and consultants (with fixed quotas), should be filled by postal personnel who have passed the postal examination. Item 3: All handling of bureau affairs, promotion and demotion of employees, rewards and punishments, and allocation of funds and investments shall not be effective unless signed by the deputy director and the head of the responsible department. Item 4: To facilitate the abolishment of the Postal Savings and Remittance General Office, the Ministry of Communications should appoint the current Director-General of the Postal General Office to take over the Postal Reserve Savings and Remittance General Office, so as to immediately cancel and consolidate the General Affairs Department, Secretary's Office, Accounting Department, Business Department, and Insurance Department within the Postal Savings and Remittance General Office, but retain the Savings and Remittance Departments and incorporate them into the original postal organization to achieve real results, and should immediately abolish the Nanjing and Hankou Savings and Remittance Branch Offices to save expenses. Item 5: The Ministry of Communications should immediately select two Deputy Directors-General of the Postal General Office from the current Postal Commissioners, one to be responsible for savings, remittance, and insurance matters, and one to be responsible for other postal matters, in order to assign responsibilities. Item 6: The future organizational chart of the Postal General Office is as follows: Director-General of the Postal General Office, Deputy Director-General in charge of postal matters, Deputy Director-General in charge of savings and remittance matters, General Affairs Department, Business Department, International Postal Department, Examination Department, Accounting Department, Finance Department, Remittance Department, Savings Department, Supply Department.</p>

Gu decided to go to Changchun, and now the puppet state allows Gu to go there conditionally. The condition is to monitor his actions. It is an unprecedented evil precedent in diplomatic history for diplomats to be unable to act freely. The Investigation Team's report will be compiled in a location that the Japanese oppose in Beidaihe and will probably be in Qingdao in the future. Our representative team has offices in both Peiping and Shanghai. We did not dare to bring important documents from our side. As soon as the representatives of the Northeast leave the area where the Japanese permit passage, they are in danger. (2nd Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan spoke about the recent criticisms and misunderstandings from the outside world regarding the truce agreement, stating that this agreement was entirely based on the two resolutions passed by the League of Nations Special Committee on March 4th and March 11th, that is, the compromise proposed by the British envoy, and did not deviate from the spirit of the League of Nations resolution in the slightest, and there was absolutely no question of surrender. After the signing, the Japanese army will successively fulfill its obligation to withdraw troops. If, after a considerable period, Japan has not yet withdrawn its troops, the Joint Committee can apply to the League of Nations General Assembly to urge the Japanese army to fulfill its obligations. As for the initial withdrawal points of the Japanese army, they are still based on the four zones proposed by the Military Subcommittee. In short, the ceasefire conference only discussed stopping the hostile actions of both sides, and did not involve any political issues. He hopes that the people of the country should have a full understanding of this point. After receiving the telegram from Shanghai that the Japanese representative was injured in the bombing, his successor to attend the meeting has not yet been determined, so the ceasefire conference on the 2nd may not be able to be held, and it may be held on the 3rd. Some people believe that it will be delayed due to the bombing case. In fact, the Japanese side has expressed its willingness to conclude the Shanghai case as soon as possible. Shigemitsu, despite being ill, has firmly stated that he will not delay the signing due to his injury, so it should be possible to sign it this week. It has not yet been decided who will represent the other party in signing. The League of Nations Investigation Team will arrive in Changchun on the 2nd, and Representative Gu will also follow. The first investigation report on the Sino-Japanese issue drafted by the team has been sent to the League of Nations Special Committee. He also said that recently, the voices for restoring Sino-Russian diplomatic relations have been growing louder. The government is carefully considering this issue. If the Soviet Union is truly sincere and restores diplomatic relations with our country based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, then we may as well consider it in good faith to promote its realization. If someone thinks that after the restoration of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations, the hidden dangers of communism will spread even more, his opinion is that the restoration of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations does not mean receiving or agreeing to communism. Our country's foreign policy is originally based on the Prime Minister's legacy, with the main purpose of uniting with nations in the world that treat us equally. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be carried out rashly. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Tass Agency, Moscow, 1 Dispatch: The celebration of the May Day commemoration here today is as grand as in previous years. No less than one million people marched through the solemnly decorated Red Square throughout the day. When Stalin, Molotov, and other government officials appeared on the platform of the Lenin Mausoleum, the crowd cheered thunderously. Diplomats from various countries participated in the celebration. The Turkish delegation, which recently visited the Soviet Union, led by the Turkish Prime Minister Ismet, received a warm welcome from the crowd. After the usual speeches, the People's War Commissar, Voroshilov, stood up and spoke, encouraging young soldiers to strive to defend the revolution. Then a large-scale military exercise began. Cavalry, artillery, and tank convoys all participated. In the sky, there were large teams of military aircraft flying around. After the military exercise, the workers of Moscow lined up to pass through Red Square. Most of the crowd wore special commemorative clothing, with patterns of the Federal Economic Construction, the success of the Five-Year Plan, and the preparation for the next Five-Year Plan attached. In slogans, the crowd expressed the Soviet people's willingness to maintain peace and their determination to resist any aggression. The night before May Day in Moscow presented a festive scene. The streets were covered with flags and colored paper. The most distinctive decoration was a model of the Minber Water Gate and a sample of the world's largest new mechanical skateball factory, which was lined up high in front of the theater. The lights were on all night, as if it were daytime. The Soviet government's gazette, Izvestia, told the workers of the country in an editorial that the important meaning of celebrating May Day is to strive for peace and to work hard for socialist construction. Reports from Moscow and other places stated that the celebrations were very enthusiastic and promoted the above-mentioned dual celebration significance.</p>

<p>Crowd's Planned Demonstration Fails</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - A May Day Labor Day demonstration was held in Hyde Park today. In the evening, the crowd planned to pass through Portman Street, where the Japanese embassy is located. Police took preventive measures in advance, stationing 250 officers on the street in the afternoon to prevent demonstrators from passing, because the crowd wanted to protest against Japan's Far East policy. A conflict eventually broke out between the two sides. The police used batons to disperse the crowd, while the crowd threw stones at the police. Mounted police also joined the suppression. As a result, two police officers and three demonstrators were injured, and eight people were arrested. Generally speaking, the May Day celebrations in various European capitals passed quietly without much disturbance.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - Some of those arrested for demonstrating yesterday were sentenced by the police magistrate's court today to fines and twenty-one days of hard labor. One of them said that he wanted to go to the Japanese embassy to oppose Japan's oppression and militarism in China. The magistrate then replied nonsensically, "I think they don't want to get involved in your requests any more than I do."</p>

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st - No accidents occurred in the German capital on May Day. There were only minor disturbances in some provinces. This year, the country has banned parades and outdoor gatherings, which is rare for many years. However, both the Communist Party and the Socialist Party held indoor meetings. As it was a time of heightened political tensions nationwide and also a Sunday, the number of attendees was very large. Speakers from both parties emphasized that a new war crisis was imminent, and workers must do their utmost to prevent it. In addition, they unanimously attacked the National Socialist Party, but the two parties also denigrated each other, each calling the other the parasites of the proletariat. Both parties sent telegrams to their French comrades, praising their efforts in the election.</p>

<p>Show a Leftward Trend</p>
<p>Socialist and Radical Parties Unite</p>
<p>The Current Cabinet Is in Danger of Collapse</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 2nd - The current French election clearly shows a trend towards the left. The Tardieu cabinet is therefore in danger, and former Prime Minister Herriot, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, may be able to form a cabinet. Now, with the union of the Socialist Party and the Radical Socialist Party, the Tardieu cabinet is in even greater danger. Today, Herriot and Frossard issued separate statements declaring that in the second round of voting next Sunday, in districts where the Radical Socialist Party received the most votes in the first round, Socialist Party voters should vote for the Radical Socialist Party candidate. Conversely, in districts where the Socialist Party received the most votes, Radical Socialist Party voters should also vote for the Socialist Party candidate. Previously, the two parties had expressed unwillingness to share responsibility in a joint coalition cabinet, but the sudden move to coordinate elections has greatly surprised observers. According to the latest reports, 244 members of parliament were elected in the first round of voting yesterday, and 359 more will be elected in the second round. Among those elected in the first round, the current government faction won only 115 seats, while the opposition won 129 seats. The number of voters was about 80 percent. Havas, Paris, 2nd - The results of the first round of the French general election for the Chamber of Deputies yesterday are as follows: Conservative Party 3 seats, Republican Party 72 seats, Left Republican Party 32 seats. These three parties are collectively known as the Right Wing, with a total of 107 seats. Radical Republican Party 24 seats, Radical Socialist Party 60 seats, Republican Socialist Party 17 seats, Socialist Party 41 seats. These four parties are collectively known as the Left Wing, with a total of 142 seats. Communist Party 2 seats. A total of 615 members of parliament should be elected to the Chamber of Deputies this time. In addition to those already elected, there are 364 remaining, who did not receive the required number of votes and must be decided in the second round of voting next Sunday. Based on the results already confirmed, the Conservative Party lost one seat compared to the previous election, the Republican Party gained two new seats, the Left Republican Party lost eight seats, the Radical Republican Party gained four more seats, and the Socialist Party gained one more seat. The Communist Party's position remained unchanged. All current cabinet members, including Prime Minister Tardieu, were elected in the first round. The leaders of the parties that stood in opposition to Tardieu in the current parliament (such as the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Communist Party), such as Léon Blum, Herriot, and Frossard, have all been elected.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 1st - Although the final results of the French general election are not yet known, the important leaders of each party were easily elected. Prime Minister Tardieu has been elected, with 3,000 more votes than his opponent, and Justice Minister Raynaud, Tardieu's great assistant, was also elected in the Paris constituency. The well-known Radical Party leader Herriot was also elected in Lyon. Saigon's results arrived earlier due to time constraints, but no one was elected in Saigon, so a second round of voting is necessary. Former Prime Minister Painlevé, Minister of Commerce Rollin, Socialist Party leader Blum, and Chamber Speaker Marin were all re-elected. However, Socialist Party Secretary-General Sarrat was defeated. Many people were stationed outside newspaper offices today waiting for the election results.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 1st - According to preliminary reports released tonight, the Radical Socialist Party's strength has greatly increased in today's general election due to public dissatisfaction with the current government's policies. Although the final results will not be confirmed until after the second round of voting next Sunday, today's first round of voting clearly indicates that the number of Radical Socialist Party seats will greatly increase compared to before. Conversely, the Socialist Party can only maintain its original position. Radical Socialist Party leader Herriot was elected in the first round of voting, with more than 2,500 more votes than each candidate. Former party chairman Daladier and other prominent politicians such as Reynaud, Lièche, Rollin, and the blind parliamentarian Sabatier were also elected. Although the country was under strict military and police surveillance today, many conflicts still occurred. Even in Tardieu's constituency of Belfort, there were clashes between Radical Socialist Party members and right-wing party members. However, the capital was relatively peaceful, with only small conflicts between the Young Patriots and the Communist Party. The group rushed into the Ivry town hall, clashed with the Communist guards, and then removed the red flag and hung the tricolor flag, because its city council was controlled by the Communist Party, so the town hall flew the red flag.</p>

<p>Claims Peace While Forcing Military Aggression</p>
<p>British Conservative Party Members Confused by Japanese Propaganda</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 2nd - Prime Minister Inukai gave a radio broadcast speech from his official residence at 7:00 PM last night, titled "Countermeasures for Domestic and Foreign Troubles," as yesterday was Labor Day. Regarding the China issue, he said: "Currently, various disputes have occurred with neighboring countries. This situation is not only unfortunate for each other, but also unfortunate for the world. There are three reasons for this. First, red elements are trying to incite international disputes. Second, there are those who make it their job to boycott Japanese goods. Third, some incite anti-Japanese sentiment due to internal affairs. Although there are various reasons, the fundamental reason lies in unequal treaties. As for extraterritoriality, we had quite a bit of experience in the abolition movement when we were young, so we deeply sympathize with China. Japan sincerely hopes to find a way to befriend China from the root, so it also hopes that China will make efforts like Japan did in the past to complete its legal code and first establish parliamentary and constitutional politics to break the current one-party dictatorship and seek national unity. This is a prerequisite. Some countries misunderstand Japan as being aggressive, but the Seiyukai's industrialization policy proves that the Japanese people love peace. The Manchurian Incident was a last resort, resorting to force was not initiated by Japan. On this point, one should not simply accuse us of aggression. I hope they will fully recognize and awaken to this." Reuters, London, 30th - Conservative Party Member of Parliament Major-General Knocks praised Foreign Minister Simon's calm and alert attitude in Geneva regarding the Sino-Japanese conflict in a speech to Conservative Party members in Slough today. He said that the British people should all be grateful for his efforts to maintain peace. He also said that since the Japanese army is now fighting against communist forces, Britain must treat Japan, which is performing brave work for the British as a fellow country, fairly.</p>

<p>Breaking the Theory of Atomic Permanence</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - A report says that British Cambridge scientists Dr. Cockcroft and Dr. Walton have invented a method to split atoms. According to Dr. Cockcroft, he tested with light hydrogen atoms, using about 120,000 volts of electricity, which was enough to split the atom into helium. The two doctors have been testing for many years under the guidance of Lord Rutherford. Lord Rutherford said that the doctor's invention is difficult to use commercially at present, but it is extremely important scientifically. According to atomic theory, all matter is made up of several kinds of extremely small atoms. Those belonging to the same kind have the same size, weight, and other properties. Since the invention of modern radioactivity, the theory of atomic permanence and indivisibility has gradually been shaken. Helium is the lightest gas and is very much needed on airships.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Japan Splits into Soft and Hard Factions on League of Nations Resolution <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Hardliners are Willing to Sever Relations with the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Compromisers Advocate Avoiding Head-on Confrontation</p>
<p>The Osaka Asahi Shimbun said that, with the resolution of the Continued Committee as the center, two major compromise proposals were put forward to ease the profound confrontation between Japan and the League of Nations: (1) the proposal of British Minister to China Lampson, and (2) the proposal of League of Nations Deputy Secretary-General Sugimura Yotaro. The contents of the two proposals are extremely confidential within the government. Generally speaking, the final withdrawal time of the Japanese army and the authority of the League of Nations Committee will be revised in the resolution to determine a compromise point between Japan and the League of Nations' opposing claims. However, in this situation, the government suddenly saw the emergence of the opposing views of compromise and non-compromise factions. The hardliners did not recognize the Continued Committee and rejected all actions of the Continued Committee interfering with the Shanghai truce negotiations, and resolutely did not allow withdrawal or change according to the established policy. If the League of Nations does not reflect on its current attitude, Japan will have no choice but to sever relations with the League of Nations. The softliners advocated avoiding a head-on confrontation with the League of Nations and resolving the situation with a policy of political compromise. That is, the decision on the final withdrawal time of the Japanese army cannot be carried out according to the authority of the committee, but the committee can submit its opinions on the situation in Shanghai to the League of Nations, so as to leave room for compromise. As a result of the division of opinions between the two factions, it was impossible to decide on a foreign policy. However, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa was very sympathetic to the compromisers, believing that political compromise could avoid conflict with the League of Nations. (Translator's note: The non-compromise faction is the minority militarist faction, who despise the League of Nations and believe that force can subdue justice, while the literati faction understands the trends of international affairs and dares not act arbitrarily, simply inviting the world's jealousy, so they are willing to give in and strive for a solution.)</p>

<h3 id="e97">Shanghai Citizens' Federation Initiates Memorial Service for Fallen Anti-Japanese Soldiers <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Letter to Various Organizations Requests Representatives to Attend</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation, in view of the considerable number of loyal and brave soldiers who sacrificed themselves to defend the nation against Japan since the beginning of the Shanghai War, as well as innocent civilians who were brutally murdered by the violent Japanese, has initiated a memorial service for the fallen anti-Japanese soldiers and victimized compatriots. Yesterday, letters were sent to various organizations and native-place associations, requesting them to send representatives to participate. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern: Since the January 28th Shanghai War, our loyal 19th Route Army and 5th Army soldiers have united to resist foreign aggression for the sake of national survival, fighting fiercely for over thirty days, finally causing the stubborn and violent Japanese to restrain their ferocity and fail in their designs. Their arduous and outstanding battle achievements have shocked the world. However, since the war, many of our loyal and brave frontline soldiers have also sacrificed themselves in righteous causes. The aspirations and spirit of these martyrs who achieved benevolence and took righteousness will forever remain in the heavens and earth. Furthermore, in this Songhu war zone, countless compatriots have suffered casualties from bullets and shells and have been innocently massacred by the Japanese invaders. Alas, how can our compatriots rest in peace? Overcome with grief, our association has initiated a preparatory office for the memorial service for the fallen anti-Japanese soldiers and victimized compatriots, located at No. 21 Hongxiang Lane, Xinzha Road. We now specially seek participation from all sectors, organizations, and native-place associations. Those who wish to participate are requested to nominate representatives to jointly initiate the event. Please reply within five days of receiving this letter so that we can notify you to attend the meeting. Your attention and cooperation are greatly appreciated."</p>
<h3 id="e98">Joint Telegram from Various People's Organizations in Shanghai Initiates National Patriotic Conference of Various Organizations <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Association of Various People's Organizations yesterday issued a telegram that stated: "To all newspapers nationwide, for circulation to civic organizations in all provinces: The violent Japanese have invaded and occupied the Northeast, trampling on Songhu. Our government has consistently adhered to a policy of non-resistance, willingly accepting national demise. The so-called long-term resistance is merely an empty theory to deceive the people, and the fact of surrendering and capitulating has become undeniable. Since the government is incapable of protecting our territory, planning for welfare, and has instead forfeited national sovereignty and destroyed the fate of the nation, such a situation will inevitably lead to national ruin and family destruction. Our people, at this time of imminent peril, seek national independence and equality, and the freedom and liberation of the nation. Relying on the League of Nations will only increase disappointment, and trusting the government is also a pipe dream. The only way out is to mobilize the entire nation, concentrate our strength, and fight to the death against the violent Japanese. Our association, recognizing that the entire nation's anti-Japanese patriotic efforts, while driven by sincerity and active struggle, have yet to be consolidated and unified in terms of their various strengths, intends to invite anti-Japanese patriotic organizations of citizens from various provinces to hold a national patriotic conference of various organizations, in order to comprehensively unite the nation's anti-Japanese forces and save the nation's fate. We earnestly request that citizens of all provinces, based on the principle that the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual, take active action and establish joint associations of citizens' organizations in each province within the shortest possible time, and send representatives to participate in the national patriotic conference to discuss the grand plan for national salvation. In addition to sending out the charter and declaration separately, this special telegram is sent to you, hoping that you will adopt and implement it. The Shanghai Joint Association of Various People's Organizations bows respectfully."</p>

<p>The newly appointed Superintendent of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Mr. Chen Fumu, arrived at the company yesterday at 9:00 AM during the weekly memorial service to assume his duties. Due to important matters, his arrival was delayed until 10:30 AM. He was first led to the Superintendent's office on the third floor by the company's General Manager, Li Guojie, for a brief rest. After about fifteen minutes, he was accompanied by General Manager Li to the reception room on the second floor to meet with the staff. During the meeting, he delivered a speech, stating, "I was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to come to the company, which has been over a month ago. Due to the numerous affairs of the Ministry, I was delayed until today to assume my duties. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the largest shipping organization in our country, with excellent docks and huge warehouses. In theory, it should also have considerable development in its business operations. However, the results are the opposite, and the internal affairs are extremely corrupt. Now, I hope that everyone will completely eradicate all previous bad habits and become a perfect China Merchants Steam Navigation Company employee. Although I was appointed by the government, I am not here to be an official, but to serve. I have always had no concept of class. Most of you are colleagues. Section chiefs and secretaries are distinctions of position, but everyone has the same rights in doing things, and there is no hierarchy. I hope that you will not see me as a supervisor coming to supervise, but that each of you will supervise yourselves. Regarding areas of the company that need reform, anyone with good plans can submit them for consideration. However, you must consider the overall situation and not just your personal interests. If you think that the reform measures of the Superintendent's office are not appropriate, you can also state your opinions. As long as it is beneficial to the company and unrelated to personal matters, it will be accepted." After Mr. Chen's speech, he was accompanied by Mr. Li back to the Superintendent's office on the third floor to briefly handle the affairs of the Superintendent. Due to the numerous affairs of the Ministry, he returned to Nanjing in the afternoon. According to Mr. Chen, the swearing-in ceremony may not be necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Minimum Electricity Charge and Meter Deposits <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Power Company Prepares to Eliminate Extra Collections</p>
<p>Shanghai Power Company announces: "The practice of electricity supply companies charging a minimum electricity fee to users is a common practice worldwide. This method is sometimes directly collected under the name of a minimum electricity fee, and sometimes collected under the name of meter rental. Currently, Shanghai Power Company adopts the former method. The direct collection of a minimum electricity fee is most suitable for situations where a user's electricity bill is less than a certain limit, and is fairer than collecting meter rental. Since a user requests electricity supply from the company but does not use it, the electricity supply company must charge a minimum electricity fee, partly to compensate for the company's interest on capital invested in electricity supply, and partly to subsidize the costs of meter reading and accounting. If a meter rental system is adopted, this rental must be included in the electricity bill and collected together, regardless of the amount of electricity used, which loses the meaning of a minimum electricity fee. Shanghai Power Company does not adopt meter rental, but adopts a minimum electricity fee restriction, precisely because this restriction is extremely fair and does not increase the burden on general users who have already used electricity supply. The origin of the minimum electricity fee is actually due to the necessity for electricity supply companies to also have protection. Electricity supply companies often find that the amount of electricity used by users is so small that the actual electricity bill is not commensurate with the expenses incurred for electricity supply. Therefore, companies need a certain degree of protection in terms of electricity supply. The minimum electricity fee is the result of this necessary protection. The purpose of adopting a minimum electricity fee is by no means to make a profit, but to provide a kind of protection against unreasonable losses. In fact, situations where a minimum electricity fee applies are rare. However, the company has set this restriction to avoid uncompensated expenses, which is fair and necessary as mentioned above. The minimum electricity fee adopted by Shanghai Power Company, before the change to monthly billing, was 3.75 taels. Now that the billing has been changed to monthly, this minimum electricity fee has been reduced to one-third, totaling 1.25 taels. Here are examples to illustrate the amount of the 70% minimum electricity fee. Assuming that a user has three 50-candlepower electric lamps and uses them for an average of three hours per day in a month, the electricity bill for a month, calculated at the current tariff, should be 1.6 taels of silver, which already exceeds the minimum electricity fee stipulated by our company. As for collecting meter deposits for electricity supply, this is also a common practice nowadays. A little observation of the situation can show that it is very fair. Electricity matters are very different from other types of businesses. After one party supplies electricity and the other party uses it, a long time must pass before an account can be opened and payment collected. In general, in Shanghai, from the time a user starts using electricity, they begin to owe the company electricity fees until the day of payment, which is about two months. That is, the user has received and used electricity for two months before paying the electricity bill. This fact is very unfavorable to the company, because under these circumstances, the company has to bear the loss of monthly interest on electricity supply expenses, and at the same time, there is a risk of users defaulting on electricity bills. This default can occur at any time. Therefore, electricity supply requires users to pay a cash deposit to cover the cost of two months of electricity usage. In Shanghai, this has become a long-standing practice. Our company has recently adopted a new accounting system and changed the old practice of collecting user electricity bills every three months to collecting them monthly. Because of this reform, our company believes that the amount of user deposits should also be reduced accordingly. We have already started to handle this, namely, reducing the amount of newly collected deposits and also refunding existing deposits where there is a clear overpayment according to the current method. However, the company's management of electricity fee deposits must be based on each user's monthly electricity usage to determine the amount to be refunded. Currently, there are as many as 65,000 users whose accounts need to be adjusted. With so many users, the adjustment is extremely cumbersome and cannot be completed in a short time. We must declare this to all sectors and ask for their understanding. Our company has absolutely no intention of withholding deposits that exceed reasonable business guarantees. Our company has already started and will continue to work hard to complete the deposit adjustment within a reasonable period. We hope that all sectors will thoroughly understand this as well. Shanghai Power Company announces."</p>

<p>The Pudong District Rent Reduction Movement Committee held a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the second floor of No. 20 Museum Road. Representatives from Huishan Road, Dalian Bay Road, Huade Road, Qiqihar Road, Taopeng Road, Zhoushan Road, Yulin Road, Linqing Road, Yangzhou Road, Songpan Road, Longjiang Road, Bekaier Road, Pingliang Road, Zhoujiazui Road, Jinsheng Road, Haizhou Road, Liaoyang Road, Ningguo Road, Qiwupu Road, Danyang Road, and Jingzhou Road, as well as You Jingqing, Li Deliang, Guo Shifu, Shan Xingwu, Gu Rui, Liu Chunsheng, Zhao Guiting, Wu Baosheng, Sun Shumo, Zhou Bingheng, Qiu Wenbing, and others, totaling over one hundred people, attended. You Jingqing was elected as chairman and Gu Rui as secretary. The chairman reported that since the Shanghai War, Pudong has faced the Huangpu River, backed onto Jiangwan, with the Japanese headquarters on the left and the Japanese landing site on the right. Security is tight, and the situation is special. To this day, various roads are still in a state of terror, with military vehicles constantly transporting supplies, military telephones still being installed, and barracks everywhere. Most of our residents, both men and women, are laborers. Although they have managed to avoid the worst for the time being, they are ultimately unable to relocate far away. Their unsettled living conditions are known to all. Moreover, the livelihood of unemployed workers is currently dependent on the relief efforts of society. How can they afford to pay rent? Our residents are not only burdened by their usual economic difficulties but also affected by the war. To seek adjustment, there is no other way than to reduce or exempt rent. Recently, enthusiastic individuals from the Citizens' Federation and other groups have initiated movements, but the Pudong area is vast. Without a strict organizational foundation, it is insufficient to provide support. Therefore, the labor unions of various factories and the residents of various industries have jointly organized this association, which is why it has emerged. How to proceed from now on? I hope that all representatives will share their great opinions and work together to achieve final victory. The resolutions of the meeting are recorded below: (1) A motion to ratify the association's previous nomination of You Jingqing, Guo Shifu, and Liu Chunsheng as representatives to attend the Citizens' Federation's district representatives' meeting was passed. (2) A motion on whether the association should join the Citizens' Federation's united movement was passed. (3) A motion on how to reduce or exempt rent in the district was resolved to be handled in accordance with the resolutions of the Citizens' Federation's district representatives' meeting. (4) A motion on how to elect the association's committee members was resolved that, in addition to the initiators being ex officio members, Xu Duo, Luo Jizhuang, Dong Juanying, Wang Lifu, Zhu Haidong, Bao Ziheng, Jiang Zhengping, Zhu Qingyu, and Shen Jinkui be additionally appointed as committee members. (5) A motion on how to collect statistics on residents in the district was resolved that representatives from each district should separately notify and register with the association. (6) A motion on how to raise funds for the association was resolved that each labor union and committee member should bear the costs equally, without collecting membership fees. (7) A motion on whether to hire legal counsel for the association was resolved to hire lawyers Wu Chengyu, Liu Hong, and Wang Peiyuan as legal counsel for the association and to publish it in the newspaper. (8) The meeting was adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Office of the Chinese Red Cross, considering that Songjiang, located on the Shanghai-Hangzhou route and close to the war zone, was in urgent need of relief efforts due to the Japanese occupation of the Shanghai waterfront, requested the Chairman of the Songjiang Branch, Mr. Zhou Jun Xuewen, to convene leaders from all sectors to establish the 43rd Wounded Soldier Hospital. Since its establishment two months ago, it has now announced its closure. Its announcement states: "During the recent Shanghai War, Songjiang City was in close proximity. Our branch was ordered by the General Office to establish the 43rd Wounded Soldier Hospital at the Songjiang Malu Bridge Bus Station to provide relief to wounded and sick soldiers, which is our duty and cannot be shirked. The necessary medical supplies, clothing, and other expenses were all approved and provided by the General Office, and no donations were solicited locally. With the situation easing, it has been decided to close the hospital on the 30th of this month, settle all public accounts, and if there are any omissions or payments that have not been processed, please invite the original handlers to the hospital within five days to verify and collect them to complete the procedures. No claims will be recognized after the deadline. This is a solemn announcement. The Red Cross's cause is purely a charitable and voluntary undertaking, which is readily supported by people at home and abroad. However, it is feared that there may be cases of people deceiving others under false pretenses, which cannot be avoided. The hospital director, in view of this, is afraid of causing problems and has to make a strict statement."</p>
<h3 id="e104">Chen Zhixin Discards His Sister and Defiles Her Sister <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Sister Accuses Chen of Abandonment</p>
<p>Requests a Large Sum for Living Expenses</p>
<p>Chen Zhixin, also known as Zhongying and Zheng Zhenping, 34 years old, a local and owner of the Changlun Paper Store at No. 44 Yongan Street, French Concession, married Qian Yuezhu from Suzhou (now 21 years old, formerly a prostitute under the name Bao Ruiyun No. 5 in the Xiaohuayuan) as a concubine in 1930. However, not long after, Chen became infatuated with Yuezhu's older sister and discarded Yuezhu like worn-out shoes. Therefore, Yuezhu hired lawyer Jiang Qishi to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court, accusing Chen of abandonment. The lawsuit reads as follows: "He loved me at first but abandoned me in the end, ignoring my illness and hunger. Please investigate to uphold the law and protect my life. I was born into a poor family and once worked in a brothel. The defendant often came to visit and we became acquainted. At that time, he was extremely affectionate towards me, and I admired Chen because of his good family background. So, we fell in love, and in February 1930, we agreed that he would pay 3,500 yuan to my adoptive mother, Jiang, to redeem me and take me as a concubine, with a monthly expense of 100 yuan. On November 28 of the same year, I gave birth to a daughter, named Xiajuan, who is now three years old. Until July of last year, my older sister came to visit. Chen saw that my sister was beautiful and became infatuated with her, and gradually became disgusted with me. He relapsed and used his seductive tricks. My sister fell into his trap, and they found a house to live together. When I found out and confronted him, Chen used sweet words and all kinds of deceptions to trick me. He even asked his friend, Mr. Liu Chaokui, to persuade me to live with his first wife and promised to break up with my sister. I believed him and moved into the old house where his legal wife lived. But in less than two months, I learned that Chen and my sister were still living together in Wenyuanfang. His behavior towards me completely changed. The lovers of the past became enemies. Occasionally when he came home, a disagreement would lead to loud insults and scolding. If he was not satisfied, he would resort to physical abuse. His wife was by his side, assisting the evildoer, intending to force me to leave. Unable to bear the abuse, I had no choice but to return to my mother's house temporarily in January of this year to avoid further abuse. On the one hand, I entrusted a lawyer to send a letter requesting living expenses, but it has been three months and he has ignored it, abandoning me like worn-out shoes. Although I am illiterate, I know a little about etiquette. A woman should follow her husband until the end. Now I am poor and helpless, unable to remarry, and have no means of making a living. The defendant, Chen Zhixin, is wealthy, with assets of more than 300,000 yuan. It is no problem for him to support me. His heart is so cruel, which is beyond my expectations and shocks all my relatives and friends. I have nowhere to go, and I am suffering from poverty and illness. If this continues, my remaining life will be hard to save. I, his wife, have been forced to beg, with tears in my eyes, that he be punished for abandonment under Article 310 of the Criminal Law and ordered to pay 48,000 yuan in living expenses in one lump sum so that it can be deposited in a money house to live off the interest, and that I be allowed to adopt my young daughter and that he be ordered to pay for her upbringing and dowry expenses, and that he return my jewelry, clothes, household furniture, etc." Yesterday, Chen did not appear when summoned. The court ordered that he be summoned again for investigation.</p>

After Du Jiyuan's brother, Du Linggou, intervened to persuade them, Yin Sanlang was released. However, Yin returned to his home in Haimen and died. The family reported the death to the Haimen County Government, which detained Zhang Zhouming and Du Linggou, pending the apprehension of Gu Yangshi for further investigation. Mrs. Yang, hearing the news, fled to Shanghai and lived at No. 704 Zhaojia Road, Ximen.

<p>Security Guard Fires a Shot</p>
<p>One Thief Escapes, One is Captured</p>
<p>Woman and Pigeons Rescued</p>
<p>Around 1:00 AM the night before, a cry for help was suddenly heard in the Xiaowujiazhai area southwest of the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Security guards from the Yangjing District Protection Corps, who were patrolling nearby, went to investigate. In the darkness, they saw two men dragging a woman out of a bamboo fence and walking towards the wheat field. The guards suspected they were bandits and fired a shot, ordering them to stop. One man immediately fell to the ground, while the other ran away. They abandoned a cloth bag (containing five white pigeons). The injured man and the woman, along with the pigeons, were taken to the corps headquarters. That night, after questioning by Corps Commander Xu, the woman stated that her name was Zhuang Chen, from Pudong, living at No. 4 Xiaowujiazhai. Her husband's name was Zhuang Fugui, a farmer. Tonight, she heard the dogs barking loudly. When she opened the door to investigate, she saw that the bamboo door was open, and there were shadows in front of the house. She shouted "Thief!" Suddenly, two men rushed out and dragged her to the field, so she shouted for help. Fortunately, the Protection Corps came to her rescue and captured one man. The five pigeons were raised by my family and were stolen by them and dropped on the road. The injured man stated that his name was Wang Yongsheng, from Zhenjiang, 43 years old. He had come to Shanghai a few days ago to find his brother but had not found him. He was staying in a hostel in Xiaodongmen. Tonight, he was persuaded by Wang Mazi, who was outside, to come to Pudong. He did not know that Wang was stealing things, which led to his capture. Wang's left sole was found to have been pierced by a bullet, but it was not a serious injury. The suspects and witnesses were sent to the Third District, then transferred to the Public Security Bureau for disposal yesterday.</p>

<p>Said He Had Nothing Else to Say Since Death Was Imminent</p>

After the case was reported, he was arrested by Chief Detective Wang Chengying of the General Patrol Station and sent to the Special District Local Court for trial, where he was sentenced to death. After the sentence was approved by the higher authorities, he was ordered to be executed. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Hechun of the Fifth Criminal Court arrived and ordered the police to bring Zhang to the court and asked if he had any last words and sent a letter to his family. Zhang Jiarong's attitude was tough and unafraid, stating, "My name is also Xiao Zhang. Today, death is imminent, and I have nothing else to say. I don't need to communicate with my parents. In short, I am unfilial." His eyes glared at the patrol station detectives, and he spoke disrespectfully, saying, "Quickly send me to Caoh Jing for execution." The court ordered the Chinese and Western police to take him away. Zhang raised his hands and asked the Western police to handcuff him, exclaiming, "I'm going to heaven!" The Chinese and Western police then escorted him onto a car, along with the case files and photographs, and drove to the execution ground at the Second Prison in Caoh Jing. The execution officer appointed by the Local Court arrived at the scene, confirmed the identity of Zhang as the person named, and ordered the bailiffs to tie him up according to the law and execute him by firing squad.</p>

<p>Circular: We respectfully inform you that the Republic of China has been established for over twenty years, and our society has been established for fifteen years. The 6th of May this year marks the 15th anniversary. Thinking of the many hardships of the times, we are greatly alarmed by the fleeting time. In the past fifteen years, the colleagues of our society have received assistance from society and have been driven by conscience. Although we have worked diligently, we dare not say that we have accomplished much. However, due to the expansion of our undertakings, we are constantly aware of our lack of ability, so we are often ashamed of excessive praise. On the occasion of the anniversary, in order to encourage interest and improve our work, we plan to ask you, without hesitation, to give us words of wisdom, poetry, and articles, and to express your high opinions on vocational education based on your own views. We will decorate the pages, gather them into rare treasures, and list the articles as a model for future generations. We have prepared the methods and enclosed them with this letter. We respectfully ask for your consideration and wish you well. Thank you for your attention.</p>
<p>▲Methods for Soliciting Artistic Works and Educational Opinions from Members of the Society (1) Our society has been established for fifteen years, during which it has experienced many hardships. It seems worthwhile to give it a proper commemoration. Soliciting poems, calligraphy, and art from members of the society is intended to permanently preserve this beautiful memory, to promote the spirit of national art, and to encourage the interest of the staff, hoping to improve work efficiency. (2) In addition to poems, calligraphy, and paintings, we seek high opinions on vocational education. The viewpoint may be based on our society, the entire nation and society, a part of the city and countryside, the entire nation, a part of the youth, or other areas, such as the system, organization, or method. The length of the text is not limited. If you can offer pointed criticism, the office of our society will earnestly indicate the direction of progress, which would be greatly appreciated by our colleagues. (3) Poems, calligraphy, and paintings may be submitted at your convenience, without any restrictions. It is best to have everything, but it is also good to have only one. If there are other artistic works that cannot be expressed on paper and you are willing to donate them for commemoration, they are also welcome. (4) The paper for poems, calligraphy, and paintings should be one foot and five inches long and one foot wide. The color and material are not restricted. For the expression of opinions, please write on ordinary letter paper. (5) Please send the donated art and opinions to us before May 21st of this year. (6) The purpose of soliciting artistic works is to showcase the art of our comrades and to preserve them permanently as a commemoration of our society. We regret that we cannot offer any remuneration. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Gold Standard Continues Strong at 6.7 Taels <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲Gold Trading Only Half Day. Yesterday, May 2nd, due to the Spring Race Day, the Gold Exchange, as usual, only operated for the morning session. The gold standard trend was soaring, but the trading volume was only two or three taels at most, and ultimately rose by seven taels or so. The silver market fell slightly the day before, but the industry's will was firm. The market opened high and fluctuated little. The foreign exchange market was good, and banks were unwilling to sell easily, so the market felt even stronger, with a sense of prosperity. All the May public bonds have now expired and have begun to be collected. Run Changyu and others collected about 3,700 bonds, while those who released them were spot dealers, etc. The market situation yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Morning Opening Up Three Taels and Three Candareens. From the early morning, the June contract opened up three taels and three candareens, at 733.5 taels. The large bars were 1/16 lower than the small bars. The silver price was the same as before, but private telegrams were 1/8 lower. Bing Xing, Hong Kangyong, and others bought in, followed by 34.5 taels. At 9 o'clock, the British and American announcements showed no prosperity or decline, which was slightly inferior, around 33 taels, which were sold by retail investors. Shortly after, one tael was added, as the American banks absorbed 30.5 yuan for this month. Subsequently, Tong Feng, Heng Yi, Feng Yong, Yuan Kangxiang, and others sold out, and the price fell by more than one tael, to 32.2 taels. Heng Yu, Shunli, Qian Changxiang, and others bought in again, at 9:40, to 35.5 taels. Da Decheng and others sold out, falling back more than two taels, to 33.2 taels at 10 o'clock. After entering, the buying side exceeded the Heng. Yuhe, Da Decheng, Zhi Fengyong, Hong Kangyong, Yi Fengyong, and others all entered, jumping 3.5 taels, to 36.7 taels around 10:30. Zhi Fengyong, Bing Xing, and others took advantage of this to sell, and Zhejiang offered a recent British gold price of 8 pence, and Mitsui offered June American gold at 5625, and July at 625, so the price fell by two taels. Until 11 o'clock, it was 34 taels. Suddenly, Zhi Fengyong, Heng Yu, and others came to buy in, and Shanghai bought July American gold at 625, so it added two taels. At 11:30, it was 36.2 taels. At this time, Tong Taichang and others sold out, and the price immediately fell by a small amount, to 34.3 taels. In a flash, it was rumored that a certain bank had opened up spot trading, and people's hearts were shaken, and buyers became diligent. However, after detailed inquiries, it was actually that the exchange rate was tight, and Qian Changxiang, Yi Fengyong, and others bought in, which led to it. The price rose by three or four taels, and at 11:50, it was 38 taels. The recent American gold only settled at 375, but many zero-lot buyers and scalpers took advantage of this to sell out, so it fell back by one tael, to 36.8 taels. Then it closed at 36.9 taels, which was 6.7 taels higher than last Saturday. However, it continued to rise to eight taels, which was dragged in by Yi Fengyong and others. Yesterday's half-day maximum was 38 taels, and the minimum was 32.2 taels, a difference of 5.8 taels. Red bars increased by 5.25 taels.</p>
<p>▲Transactions with More Buying Than Selling. According to surface transactions, Yuan Mao Yong, Qian Changxiang, Shunli, Futai Heng, Hong Kangyong, and Bing Xing all bought in. Zhi Fengyong, Da Decheng, Yuan Tai, Yuhe, Heng Yu, and others had frequent buying and selling. Yi Fengyong, Yuan Kangxiang, and others sold out and then bought in. Most of the other firms bought more than they sold.</p>

The exchange rate also did not change. The HSBC list did not change, but the internal market seemed good. It initially appeared strong, then flat, and became tighter at noon. As a result, the British and American exchange rates each decreased by 125 compared to last Saturday, so the gold price trend was sharp. Chinese merchants were very active in trading, and hedgers bought in. The British gold was only 20,000 to 30,000 pounds, and the American gold was 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, mostly for settlement. It was also heard that the British American Tobacco Company was also settling accounts. It was said that the afternoon was a holiday due to the first day of the Western merchants' spring race.</p>

<p>Price of Interest Suddenly Rises by Four Li</p>
<p>Silver Borrowing Becomes Loose and Excessive</p>
<p>▲Market Overview. In the past two days, because the money industry cancelled the interbank remittance of various Chinese and foreign payments, free flow has been achieved, and the situation has suddenly become lively. Various bills, both Chinese and foreign, can now circulate freely without the need for reserves. With the turnaround in the market, the price of interest has become prosperous and suddenly increased. Silver borrowing has become loose and excessive, which is also the first good phenomenon since the January 28th Incident.</p>
<p>▲Interest Rate and Borrowing Price. (Silver Interest) In the early market, some people also bought the interest rate, which made it quite colorful. The closing price was 1.25 li higher than the early market the day before, at 7 qian and 0.2 li. At noon, it suddenly continued to rise by 3 li, to 7 qian and 0.45 li. The total increase between the two markets was 4 li and strong, and people's hearts became energetic again. (Silver Borrowing) In the early market, transfer and silver borrowing only opened at 5 fen, which was 4 fen lower than the previous morning. In the noon market, it actually borrowed for free, which was the first sound since the war. Banks had no list to list, and there was no way to add water to the transfer. As a result, the market was all borrowed and transferred for free.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market. In the morning, Jiangnan small silver dollars were also slightly bought, and the price was 1 li higher, at 6 qian, 1 fen, and 1 li, with a transaction of 7,500 jiao.

<p>Various Industries Seem to Have the Possibility of Activity</p>
<p>Money Industry Cancels Interbank Remittances</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, it was impossible to talk about the rise and fall of commerce. Now there is hope for peace, and various commercial activities are gradually returning to their original state, especially the cancellation of interbank remittances by the money industry, which is most welcomed by various industries. As a result, business has greatly progressed and is quite prosperous. Here is a brief record of what I have heard, for the reader's information.</p>
<p>(1) The Exchange began to trade with each other, and the prices of various bonds rose sharply, and two or three bonds were actually suspended due to excessive prices. (2) Wholesale merchants are issuing tickets for goods one after another, and Chinese and foreign goods can still be exchanged for money shop tickets, which are actively circulated, as in the past. (3) Telegrams and letters for foreign remittances and purchases are pouring in, and purchases from the Nanyang Islands are particularly strong. (4) Various ports purchase goods, such as summer and new autumn necessities, regardless of food or supplies, and they are all bought with courage. (5) It is heard that cotton yarn is being shipped to Guangdong, Hubei, Anhui, Shandong, Chongqing, Hunan, and other places, piled up at the docks, and it is also heard that quite a lot is being shipped to other ports. (6) The prosperity of domestic goods wholesale is more successful than before the January 28th Incident, because at that time it was the end of the year and there was not much demand. Now is the time for each good to expand its sales, so the situation is particularly courageous. (7) The financial industry's silver supply and the purchase of goods are quite active, and a lot of money is received. Although yesterday was the afternoon closing of the horse races, the prosperity was still undiminished, which shows that there will be good news for us when the races are open all day for three days.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Securities and Bonds Market Opened Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Dark Market Prices Rose Too Much</p>
<p>Various Bonds Were Suspended</p>
<p>Nearly 700,000 Transactions</p>
<p>The long-publicized issue of the resumption of the bond market has been officially opened. Because the surrounding environment has been better recently, the dark market has risen quite a bit. In fact, the book price at the time of the market closure on January 25 has increased by four or five yuan, so when the market opened in the morning, the various bonds were suspended. Only the two types of the whole six customs duty did not reach the suspension of trading, and the seven-year 96 had no transactions. Although the June futures have been opened, except for the 19 customs duty, there are no other transactions. It is found that the transactions of the various bonds futures have been suspended due to the increase in prices, so there is not much inflow and outflow. Only 685,000 yuan was opened throughout the day. The spot transactions were still not lonely, and a total of 113,500 yuan was opened. As far as the rise and fall of the prices of the various bonds are concerned, although many bonds have been suspended, there is a difference of several yuan compared to the dark market at the end of last month, so this month may continue to rise. The standard for its increase and suspension is based on the book price on January 25. If the already received is removed from the past few months, then the increase is actually very large. The price and transaction volume of each bond yesterday are listed below. (Unit: Yuan)</p>

<p>The Lowest Price of American Cotton Is Less Than Five and a Half Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to good weather and a sluggish cloth market, and bulls closed out their positions.

<p>▲Not Many Rice Merchants from Shanghai South Came to Shanghai North in the Past Two Days, About 30. Transactions in Urban and Rural Areas Were Not Very Active. Early Rice Merchants from Rural Villages Had a Slight Increase in Prices of 1-2 Jiao. Although Changxi North Early Rice and Su Tong Rice Were Received, They Were Few in Number. Opening Prices Were Lowered by Several Points. Ordinary Transformations Were Obscure, and Each Maintained Its Original Plate. Foreign Pointed Rice Was Scarce and There Was No Market.</p>
<p>The Source of Goods in Shanghai North Was Limited Yesterday, and Transactions in Urban and Rural Areas Were Normal. The Price of Top-Quality Su Chang North Early Rice Increased by About 1 Jiao. Bo Rice Sales Were Active in the Ningbo Region, and There Was a Way to Send Rice Out, So the Trend Continued to Increase. Transformation Yin Yuan and Foreign Du Pointed Rice Were Lacking, and the Situation Was Stable. Fewer Guest Pointed Rice Loads Arrived, and the Market Plate Rose.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Inland Merchants Purchase Coarse Foreign Rice <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Each Rice Station Resided… A New Ship Arrived Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Appetite of the Merchants from the Interior Was Very Good. In Addition to Buying Small Twisted Rice in the Market, They Also Purchased Small Twisted Coarse Rice and Qieladi Coarse Rice. Coarse Rice Has Not Been Guest-Oriented for a Long Time. The Goods Arriving at the Port Are All Grounded White by the Rice Mills and Then Sold in the City. Yesterday, After the Interior Merchants Handled It, the Situation Immediately Improved. The Merchants from Hankou Were Still Interested in Handling It, and the Merchants from Ningbo Also Asked About More Than 1,000 Bags of Small Twisted Rice, So Even Though There Was a New Small Twisted Rice Ship Arriving Yesterday, With 40,000 Bags, the Market Still Stood Firm. If Various Merchants Continue to Handle It Smoothly Today and Tomorrow, Then the Market Situation Still Has the Necessity of Rising. It Is Estimated That 500 Bags of No. 1 Saigon Were Sold, at a Price of 11 Yuan, 3 Jiao, and 2 Fen. 7,000 Bags of Small Twisted Rice Were Sold, at a Price of 10 Yuan, 4 Jiao, and 2 Fen to 10 Yuan. 500 Bags of Small Twisted Coarse Rice Were Sold, at a Price of 9 Yuan and 4 Jiao. 1,700 Bags of Qieladi Coarse Rice Were Sold, at a Price of 9 Yuan, 5 Jiao, and 1 Fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, People's Hearts in the Powder Market Turned Good Again, Because Merchants from Tianjin, Shandong, and Nanyang All Had Appetite, and Gradually Collected About 40,000 Bags from the Market, So the Military Ship Initially Called 2 Taels, 0 Fen, 7 Li, 7 Hao and a Half, and Later Opened to 8 Fen and 2 Li and a Half. However, the Number of Outgoing Households Was Instead More Abundant at This Time, So It Went Back 2 Li and a Half. The Red and Blue Car Initially Called 2 Taels, 0 Fen, and 7 Li and a Half, and Later Committed 2 Li and a Half, Which Was About 7 Li and a Half More Than the Previous Week's Closing Price. The Green Turret Opened at 2 Taels, 0 Fen, and 4 Li and a Half, and It Was Very Rare to See Appetite. The Remaining Files Were All Directly Purchased from the Manufacturers Because There Were No Chips on the Market, and They Were Still Sold Back and Not Loose. It Was Extremely Unlikely That the Manufacturers' Spot Goods Would Fall Before the Exchange Opened. With the North Sales Tight, We Still Have to See How to Support It [North and South Goods Lychee Dry Drops Unceasingly&gt;</p>
<p>Lychee Dry Has Recently Been Slow in Sales, and the Flowers and Seedlings in Each Production Area Are Very Prosperous This Year. The New Output This Year Is Expected to Be a Good Harvest, So the Market Price Has Turned Down Very Quickly. For Example, Jinshan Branch, Which Was Sold for More Than 60 Taels in the Previous Market, Is Now Not More Than 50 Taels in the Current Market. The Next Highest Is Lanchu Branch, Which Is More Than 40 Taels, and Cizhuang Is Not More Than 40 Taels. The Other High Zhuang Yuan Hong Branch, Which Was Once Close to 100 Taels, Is Now Sold for 60 Taels. After This, If the Market Does Not Rise, Then the Decline Will Not Be Stopped Immediately.</p>

<p>Yesterday Was the First Day of the Spring Races for Foreign Merchants Residing in Shanghai. Each Foreign Firm in This Port Followed the Example and Stopped Working in the Afternoon. The Foreign Firm Silk Market Only Had a Half-Day Market in the Morning. At the Occasion When the European and American Silk Sales Fell Sharply and the Silk Price Repeatedly Suffered Tragic Falls, It Was Difficult for Chinese Silk Merchants to Sell Because of Heavy Profits, and the Factory White, Yellow, and Gray Silks Were Completely Stagnant. There Were No Negotiations in the Market Yesterday.</p>

<p>Borrowing 1.8 Million Yuan... Establishing a Cooperative Sales Committee. The Morning People of Each Department in Zhejiang Province, in View of the Fact That Last Year's Spring Silkworms Suffered Heavily from the Damage of the Weather, and Furthermore, the National Disaster Was in Full Swing, the Rural Economy Declined, and the Amount of Spring Silkworm Rearing Was Greatly Reduced. Statistics Only Reached 30-40% of Previous Years, but the Silk and Silk Industries Both Failed, and the Finance Was Extremely Tight. There Was No Ability to Collect Cocoons, and No One Asked About the Cocoon Shops in Each Department. In the Future, Cocoon Households Would Definitely Not Be Able to Benefit. Both the Financial and Construction Halls Had This in Mind. Now, They Are Establishing a Silkworm Cocoon Relief Association With the Silver Money Industry, and Decided to Borrow 1.8 Million Yuan to Plan the Silkworm Cocoon Cooperative Transportation and Sales Committee. The Financial and Construction Halls Together Sent Three Committee Members, the Silver Group Sent Three People, and Another Three Experts Were Extended to Be Committee Members. The Cocoon Production Counties in the Entire Province Were Divided Into Several Regions, and Several Cooperative Societies Were Established to Lend and Pay the Farm Silkworms Appropriate Funds and Sell Cocoons on Behalf of the Cocoon Households as Their Business. It Is Heard That the Previous Loan Has Been Negotiated With the Silver Group and Is Expected to Be Realized in the Near Future.</p>

<p>▲The Head Tea Develops Prosperously. Although the Winter Climate Was Very Cold in Wuyi Spring Tea, the Tea Trees Facing the Wind on the Plains Were Fortunately Not Injured. This Spring, the Weather Was Clear and the Rain Was Evenly Distributed. The Tea Trees Facing the Sun Had Already Shown Sparrow Beaks After Qingming. The Weather Suddenly Turned Warm and Rainy These Days, and the Tea Leaves Drew More Buds. According to Mountain Households, the Tea Body Development This Year Is More Prosperous Than in the Past, and the Output Will Definitely Be a Good Harvest. If the Weather Continues to Be Clear and Warm and Not Cold, the Head Tea Can Be Opened in Ten Days. However, the Budding of Mountain Tea Is Slower Due to the Shelter of Trees and Soil.</p>
<p>▲Mao Feng Can Be Released Soon. Mao Feng, Made in the Yibei Yanchuan, Zhangcun, and Jinzhu Areas, Has Always Been Famous. The Fragrant and Pure Quality and Taste Are Not Inferior to Hangzhou's Longjing and Fujian's Wuyi. In Recent Years, It Has Become a Valuable Item Because of the Increasing Number of Distant Purchasers and Self-Addiction to Gifts. Recently, Mountain Households Intend to Collect and Make It in Time Because the Tea Buds Are Budding Green and Tender. It Is Heard That This Year's Tea Households Are Even More Actively Making Improvements to the Mao Feng Making Method in Order to Become Treasures. If the Weather Is Clear and Bright, There Can Be New Releases Within Days.</p>
<p>▲The Lack of Foreign Impact on Tea Funds. The Tea Foreign Funds of Each Firm in This County, in Addition to the Supply of Local Merchants, Have Always Relied on Jingde, Raozhou, Leping, Tunxi, and Other Ports as a Large Source. This Year, the County Seat and Townships of This County Have Very Little Current Foreign Income and Very Thin Foreign Stock Due to the Impact of the Situation and the Sluggish Commerce. Although Tun Jing Le Has Abundant Current Foreign and the Foreign Li Is Low, They Are Deeply Concerned About the Dangers of Transporting Current Far Away in View of the Fact That the Bandit Atmosphere Is Not Peaceful, So Each Firm Has Been Sparing No Effort in Searching for the Current Foreign of Merchants Recently. Because Merchants Have Extensive Foreign Use and the Supply Does Not Meet the Demand, They Have All Suppressed the Ticket Price, Selling Only More Than 1,360 Yuan per Thousand Taels, Which Is 20-30 Yuan Less Than Rao Le and Other Places. It Is Expected That When the New Tea Is Listed, It Will Definitely Feel the Pain of Foreign Shortage.</p>

<p>— Xiaoqing</p>
<p>My friend Cheng Xiaoqing recently wrote a film script, "The Revival of the National Soul." It depicts modern men and women who are awakened by the stimulus of national crisis. It is quite sufficient to criticize the current customs and promote national spirit. At the end of the play, it is crowned with a song of the national soul. The words are magnificent and can serve as a warning. I am eager to record it. Cuckoo. The national soul is revived, the glory of the motherland,</p>
<p>Let us fight together, annihilate those tigers and wolves,</p>
<p>The green blood is scattered, flowing for thousands of years,</p>
<p>To save this crazy situation, to revitalize our Chinese!</p>

<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Martyr Zhu Zhuoting was from Qiantang. He studied at Fudan University in Shanghai. When the Shanghai Incident suddenly arose, he happened to be in the Xinmin Dormitory on North Sichuan Road, which led to his capture by the violent Japanese. At that time, the Japanese army's plan of aggression could not succeed, so they shifted their poison to good people and treated them cruelly. The pen could not bear to describe it. Students were even worse. Fourteen prisoners in the same dormitory were imprisoned in one room. They were forced to confess who had the military uniforms in the dormitory. Otherwise, they would all be subjected to extreme torture. The martyr could not bear to see the fourteen people die together, so he stood up and responded. He scolded the Japanese slaves and confessed that he was a member of the Fudan Volunteer Army and had nothing to do with the others. The martyr then died, and the others in the same difficulty escaped. In the past, the martyr had a strong personality and served in the school's volunteer army. He was able to do his duty. His love for the country was deeply rooted. Therefore, his death this time was to repay his long-cherished wish. The martyr had only been away from Hangzhou for two days when he suffered this misfortune. He died at the age of twenty-six.</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Jinan Incident and the Shanghai Incident <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Junfang</p>
<p>May 3rd, 1928. Japanese soldiers marched into Jinan Prefecture, Shandong Province, our China. The cries of our compatriots echoed like ghosts. Even the diplomat Mr. Cai Gongshi died with them. How terrible! After the Japanese soldiers invaded, there were many negotiations. It wasn't until May of the following year that the Japanese soldiers occupying Jinan were willing to withdraw.</p>
<p>At the time of the troop withdrawal, the general public was outraged and heartbroken by the Japanese soldiers' forceful occupation of Jinan and the killing of compatriots the previous year. It seemed that the resentment had subsided a lot. But at that time, I had a different feeling. I dared not be optimistic. Because at that time, the Japanese troop withdrawal was only a temporary return of some of China's jurisdiction over Shandong. They could still come to occupy our territory and kill our compatriots at any time.</p>
<p>"It is terrible for the Japanese soldiers to come and not leave. But is it impossible for them to come again once they have left? Does our country have the power to ensure that Japanese soldiers will not come again? I'm afraid that if they come again, they won't go to Jinan. They will kill Chinese compatriots in another place. If things go wrong, they might even come to Shanghai on the south bank of the Yangtze River to kill people. It can be imagined that the degree of danger to our people is the same whether the Japanese soldiers withdraw or not. Considering the compatriots outside of Jinan, the danger is only increased."</p>
<p>Although I had such wild thoughts as mentioned above at that time, after some time, I gradually forgot them. Oh no. On the evening of January 28th this year, my previous wild thoughts unfortunately became a reality. Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong, Baoshan, Zhenru, Nanxiang, Taicang, Dachang, Huangdu…</p>
<p>…Compatriots in areas near Shanghai are now being burned and killed by Japanese soldiers. They are crying like ghosts, displaced, and everything has been reduced to ashes. Isn't it much more severe than the degree of harm inflicted by Japanese soldiers on Jinan compatriots five years ago? Thinking of the past and present, today, in the midst of the chaos in Shanghai, commemorating the May 3rd Jinan Massacre of a few years ago, I truly feel "how heartbreaking it is."</p>
<p>Thinking carefully about the Jinan Incident in the past and the Shanghai Incident now, I cannot help but have a few more words to tell my compatriots. The Japanese soldiers who came before have left, but now they have come again. Those from other countries who have not come (?) can also come. The reason is simple. Because our country can simply be said to have no national defense at present. There is only "provincial defense." "Provincial defense" can only be used to divide up territory and cannot be used to resist foreign enemies. Oh, our poor people. How should we fight against the old and new warlords and imperialists in the future to preserve the vitality of our Chinese nation?</p>

<p>Strange Jobs. There are many strange jobs in the city of London. But the strangest of all is watching chimneys. The London City Council has a strict ban on black smoke coming out of factory chimneys. Anyone who violates the ban will be severely punished. Therefore, most factories employ people who specialize in watching chimneys to avoid violations and penalties. In the city of Gilsee, there is a subway power station that has built a small house on the roof for the chimney watcher to live in. He walks in and out from time to time, watching the large chimneys. He holds a small glass screen with four different colors of glass, light and dark. As soon as he sees smoke, he looks at it through the screen and compares it with the color on the glass. If the smoke is the same as the darkest color, he immediately gets busy and presses an electric button. Immediately, the bell rings loudly and the bugles blare. Dangerous signals appear in many offices. Then, the stoker tries to suppress the black smoke. The chimney watcher's responsibility is considered fulfilled.</p>

<p>— Seeking Happiness Studio Owner</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Breaking off relations with a thankless person brings unexpected encounters with generous guests. A plan to resolve affection is most difficult to carry out and is not in any way comparable to having beautiful woman's favor. Liang Xiaoyun lowered her face and said, "You underestimate me too much. How can you be so sure that I don't deserve to have a good idea? Well, let me tell you honestly. If I were to boast, this matter is something that only I can do to help you a lot. You have been friends with me all along, so you can be said to have gained something from the relationship. However, I still need to ask my other friend for help. General Supervisor Ye has a most favored Fifth Concubine. She used to be my best friend. If you want to work under General Supervisor Ye, there is no need to take the detour of applying to the military academy. Just let me communicate with her and mention it to the Fifth Concubine. If she recommends you to General Supervisor Ye, you will definitely get a ready-made letter of appointment. The position will definitely be much higher than a company commander. In the future, with this opportunity for advancement, and if you continue to work hard and form a new team, becoming a senior commander will not be difficult. What do you think? The path that I have considered for you should be good." An Yutian pondered and said, "Of course, this path is very good. It's just a pity that it is not very honorable or legitimate. But I am always grateful for your kindness. Nowadays, people of ambition don't have to be selective about the means to achieve their goals, so I won't bother about that so much. But when you go to the Fifth Concubine to recommend me, how should you phrase it? And what kind of relationship should you say we have?" Although Liang Xiaoyun had a plan in mind, she did not expect An Yutian to ask such a silly question himself. For a moment, she did not know how to answer. She just smiled coldly and said, "That will have to depend on you yourself." After saying that, a maid walked in and said that dinner was ready. Liang Xiaoyun instructed to have it served in the bedroom. Immediately, a table of the most delicious home-cooked meals was brought in. An Yutian still had not had a drop of water or grain in his stomach today. And with Liang Xiaoyun's such attentive persuasion, he could not help but eat his fill. After dinner, he paced back and forth in the room, thinking of Liang Xiaoyun's question to him earlier. It was really between understandable and incomprehensible. He couldn't help but ask for clarification. So he said with a shameless face, "When you see the Fifth Concubine, should you say that we are friends or relatives? Would that work?" Liang Xiaoyun sat on the edge of the bed, with a cigarette in her cherry lips, as if she was thinking about something intently. Hearing that An Yutian was still acting so foolish, she said lightly, "You should decide for yourself. Anyway, I have already decided to help you. You don't know my feelings for you. Please sit here for a while. Let's find some entertainment after dinner to pass the time."</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e154">A Letter from Mr. Fang <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The other day, I received three letters from Mr. Fang. One was for Mr. Shi Liangcai, one was for the chief editor, and one was for the editor of this publication. Two were registered,</p>
<p>and one was sent by ordinary mail. The address was Fang Dunfu, but the signature inside the letters was "A Member of the Public." The content of the three letters was exactly the same. He disapproved of and attacked this publication on roughly two points:</p>
<p>1.  The Mass Literature section does not approve of old-style poetry.</p>
<p>2.  Popular science is too far removed from the masses.</p>
<p>As for whether Mr. Fang sent three letters in one day with other intentions, I do not know, nor do I have the energy or time to explore them. However, I admit that the two points Mr. Fang indicated are indeed somewhat inconsistent with the word "masses." However, I must briefly explain the reasons for my editing and the process involved, and discuss them with the general readers and contributors.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the reform of this publication, I originally wanted to make the content of this publication completely populist, using easy-to-understand language. Science would also be practical and related to ordinary applications. This was the original intention of reforming this publication. In fact, the word "science" was already somewhat inappropriate. According to Liang Rengong,</p>
<p>"The analysis and synthesis of experiential facts to derive a general rule that is closest to the truth, in order to deduce similar things, this kind of learning is called 'science.' The materials changed or the machines constructed by applied science can only be called the results of science and cannot be equated with 'science' itself."</p>
<p>Whether Rengong's explanation is appropriate, I do not know, because his explanation of the meaning of the term science is similar to logic. Logic is originally the study of reasoning, the law of all laws, the learning of all learning, and its function is also like this. This question will naturally be discussed by those who are learned and knowledgeable, and I will not care about it for the time being. However, after trying it for a month,</p>
<p>literature takes the form of vernacular poetry (the so-called new poetry) and vernacular prose, and science also takes the form of easier-to-understand and practical content.</p>
<p>However, after careful selection, there are indeed a few articles in the new poems and new texts that are rich in artistic meaning, but they are not often seen. There are also many that casually describe a few sentences without being profound. Moreover, the definition of the two words "literature and art" is even more difficult. If we speak in a broad sense, none of the articles published in this publication has no artistic value. If we speak in a narrow sense, which article has artistic value and which kind of text can be considered to have artistic value is something that even I do not know.</p>
<p>As for science, it is originally a specialized subject that the masses do not come into contact with. Moreover, most of the contributions submitted by contributors are studies of the principles of various substances, and most of them are not very practical. It is very difficult to choose those that conform to the purpose of the word "masses."</p>
<p>To be honest, the editors of this publication are not only laymen to science, but also have a half-baked understanding of the two words "literature and art" and do not understand them at all. I am deeply grateful to all the contributors who help me every day. However, the space in this publication is limited, and since the war, the front line has been shortened even more, so I have not been able to publish as much as possible. This is what I regret, (to be continued)</p>

<p>— Naizheng</p>
<p>Machine guns occupy a very important position in the army's ordnance, because they are easy to carry and fire bullets quickly, and they have great uses in both defense and offense.</p>
<p>Machine guns can be divided into several parts: gun body, gun, loading machine, continuous shooting machine, and tripod. But their uses are different, so there are five kinds of machine guns in modern times. Now I will describe them separately...</p>
<p>(1) Heavy machine guns fire at a speed of 400 to 700 rounds per minute and require three or four people to manage, but the latest American heavy machine guns can be operated by two people. To transport it, it usually requires horses or cars, but some people also carry it. Its firing range (i.e., range) can reach 13,000 feet, and it is most powerful within 10,000 feet. The Japanese army's Type 3 machine gun is of this type. (2) Light machine guns have a firing speed of 500 to 800 rounds per minute and can be operated by two people. The range is about the same as that of heavy machine guns, but it is more powerful within 7,000 feet. It was invented and had good effectiveness in the first year of the European War. Later, it was vigorously promoted and became the main weapon of the infantry. According to the organization of the national army, each regiment has one machine gun company. Its importance can be seen. The lightest light machine gun weighs only 22 pounds, which is about 16.5 pounds in our country, and is very convenient to carry. Therefore, it is used during charges, but the heavy machine guns mentioned above are mostly used for defense.</p>
<p>(3) Handheld machine guns are petite and exquisite, and weigh even less, only about 13 or 14 pounds. One person can operate it. When not in use, it is held on the shoulder like a rifle. The barrel is the shortest of the five types, so the range is also the shortest. But it is light and easy to operate, easy to hit the enemy, and its power is very fierce in normal distances, so the guards of important figures in our military all use handheld machine guns.</p>
<p>(4) Aircraft machine guns are either installed on aircraft or carried on aircraft for downward strafing or mutual aerial combat. The weight and range are the same as light machine guns, but the firing rate is more than 1,300 rounds per minute. There is also a double-barreled one that can fire at the same time, which is even more fierce.</p>
<p>(5) Anti-aircraft machine guns are used to shoot down aircraft. They are mounted on a frame, with the muzzle pointing upwards, and the barrel forming an angle of 45 degrees to 90 degrees (right angle) with the plane. Within this range, it can be raised and lowered arbitrarily and can be rotated. Its barrel is the longest of the five types, so its range is very long, about 15,000 feet, and it can penetrate the body of an aircraft within 10,000 feet. Because it continuously fires 600 rounds per minute, the bullets fly like a string of beads. If an aircraft is hit by it, it must be hit by at least five bullets. As for its attachments, there is also a reflex sight.</p>
<p>The firing power of machine guns is fierce, the rate is very fast, and the bore is tight and long. The friction of the bullets flying out continuously generates a great deal of heat. Therefore, it must be cooled, otherwise the bore will melt and crack. The old-fashioned gun bore had an extra layer of space outside, storing cold water or other liquids, which had to be replaced from time to time, but the heat could make the water boil, and it would dry out in a short time. Therefore, it was very inconvenient if it encountered a sandy field with no water. Therefore, air cooling has been used in recent years to avoid this disadvantage.</p>

<p>After January 28th, our army fought against the Japanese army and won repeatedly, and on several occasions, they even captured the enemy's headquarters. During this period, there were many heroic stories that were both tearful and inspiring.</p>
<p>When the war broke out, the most fierce fighting took place in Tiantong'an. Because Tiantong'an was close to the enemy's headquarters, our army and the enemy fought hand-to-hand several times, gaining and losing repeatedly! Later, the enemy did not hesitate to attack with all their strength.</p>
<p>At that time, the situation was very critical. Five soldiers in our army jumped out and petitioned the officer, willing to be a suicide squad to defeat the enemy. The officer granted their request. He took pictures of them and taught them to write their wills. Then, each of them hung a large bomb on their chest and carried a box of gasoline on their back. At the order, they desperately rushed towards the enemy's headquarters, followed by only a few soldiers. These five heroic soldiers rushed into the enemy's headquarters, and immediately the bombs exploded, burning their bodies to the bone. The enemy was unprepared and thought that our main force had arrived, so they were frightened out of their wits and dropped their weapons and ran away. So our army won a great victory and turned the crisis into safety.</p>
<p>It is a pity that these five soldiers did not leave behind their names. To this day, we remember the heroes with a mixture of grief and indignation!</p>

<p>Every day is the same, I am still sleeping in bed when I hear the newspaper sellers calling out. A simple "Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao... Shishi Xinbao... Shibao," from far to near, and then from thick to thin. But in the early morning light of yesterday, in the hazy spring sleep, I heard "a high-pitched cry, which was different"... It simply made me excited.</p>
<p>"Nanny!" I shouted... "Quickly go buy a copy of Shen Bao.</p>
<p>Originally, I could go to the office to read it, but that would be too late.</p>
<p>"Sir! Sixteen copper coins," the nanny said, returning with the newspaper...</p>
<p>"Oh? Why is it so expensive?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, but he said (today it will be sold more expensively, don't let anyone else have it), and ran off immediately..."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I understand." Because I was eager to read it, I didn't want to haggle with her.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the newspaper published the news in the most conspicuous place, and it was also vividly described, using all the skills of description.</p>
<p>Really, this is an amazing piece of news worth recording, otherwise how could the newspaper sellers make a big profit? Even I sincerely respected that person!</p>
<p>Later, in the tram to the office, I had the opportunity to listen to the various brilliant discussions of the Chinese people...</p>
<p>"It's a pity there isn't a XX," a gentlemanly middle-aged man said with a sigh. An old woman followed up by saying...</p>
<p>"Amitabha!"</p>
<p>"But we Chinese don't even have half of one; sigh!" You think? This is a small businessman said sadly. However, he immediately suffered the contemptuous cold eyes of a student sitting opposite him, as if to say, "Why don't you try it yourself?" So the businessman had to lower his head and remain silent. Suddenly, a strong young man in short clothes also joined their conversation.</p>
<p>The tram unknowingly reached its destination, so I hurriedly got off the tram, and in the end I didn't hear the young man's conclusion.</p>
<p>Alas!</p>

<p>— Flood</p>
<p>Next door to my house is a Japanese-owned Ashino Barber Shop; the storefront is decorated very elaborately, so you can always hear the glass spring door "chirping and gurgling"! There is a busy atmosphere. As far as I know, there is a Korean barber named Kim Ding San employed by the shopkeeper; in addition to his formal work, he really seems like a "capable person who does more work" and also has to take on extra tasks… "Buying things, welcoming and seeing off customers."</p>
<p>Every morning, Kim Ding San routinely goes to the Hongkou vegetable market to buy vegetables, and the snow-white dog raised by the shop owner also routinely follows him step by step to visit the vegetable market. Every time he walks in front of my house, if he sees my little brother, he never misses the opportunity to play with him. He often says, "Little baby, how cute!" But for some reason, he doesn't like the little Easterners very much. Sometimes I see him holding the little Easterners publicly, but he always shows some expression of being forced to obey orders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, like a bolt from the blue, the ruthless artillery fire in Zhabei echoed loudly, turning the residents along Zhaofeng Road into a bleak and fearful tragedy. The boss of the Ashino Barber Shop was very wary of the Chinese people's unanimous anti-Japanese sentiment. In addition to guarding the large glass display windows with iron grilles and wooden boards, he also hid himself deep inside and never dared to show his face easily. But the boss's self-satisfied laughter, "The Great Japanese Empire is promoting its national prestige," often accompanied the rumbling of guns and cannons, constantly being sent over to my house through the cracks in the walls!</p>
<p>Later, as the war became tight, Japanese residents—especially Koreans and Taiwanese—were mostly sent to serve as plainclothes detectives. Kim Ding San, who has always taken "absolute obedience" as his duty, naturally had to go to the trouble of doing this noble deed that he himself was unwilling to do on behalf of the shop owner—being a member of the plainclothes team! When he walked out of the store with his head down, dejected, and was about to report to the XX Headquarters, only the "snow-white" dog, unaware of the times, still stumbled out to chase him, but was finally discovered by the shop owner's wife, who quickly ran over and carried it back.</p>
<p>The bleak and gloomy moon, the sparse and swaying starlight, the patches of war clouds, and the shouts of "kill" by the battlefield warriors, all rushed together; the gunshots and artillery shells created a sky full of red fireflies, and gusts of yin wind brought the cries of the wounded in pain! At dawn one day, at the end of a bridge shrouded in heavy fog, there was a person dressed like a refugee vaguely watching and dodging; unexpectedly, at the other end of the bridge, which was marked by a blue and white flag fluttering in the wind, a few energetic soldiers suddenly stood up, aimed at him in unison, and shouted loudly, "Who is it?" That person was probably "new to the battlefield"! He panicked for a moment and turned around to run, only to hear a "bang" and the person fell down in response. These soldiers rushed to him one after another, only to see him struggling and rolling in a pool of blood, while stammering in a very rusty Shanghai dialect… "This… one… thing… I… feel… that… our… life… is… not… even… as… good… as… a… snow-white… dog… my… enemy… is… still… my… enemy…" Finally, he sighed out an "XX" and became motionless.</p>

<p>The Paris Theater is releasing the lower part of "Fantastic Beasts" today. The upper part of this film has already received enthusiastic praise from all walks of life. The plot of the lower part is even more intense, and all the strange beasts of the mountains and forests, those not seen in the upper part, all appear in the lower part. There is a scene that writes of the protagonist, Greto's bravery. There are lions and tigers in front, and chasing soldiers in the rear. Greto then climbed up a tree, while poisonous snakes and crocodiles in the water all opened their mouths to wait. Viewers at this point cannot help but squeeze a handful of sweat. However, this film must be transported to other ports to be shown in Shanghai, and the days are few. Those who want to see the real wild beast giant film should not miss the opportunity.</p>
