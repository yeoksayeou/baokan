<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c1">政府果和乎 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>比日來所謂停戰會議。業已在友邦斡旋之下正式舉行。目前雖以外交上必有之波折而陷於閃爍不定之局勢之中。但事實則已明白昭示我國人。政府已趨於和之途徑矣。</p>
<p>在九一八禍變之初。吾人雖日促政府下長期抗禦之决心。但事實上昭示於吾人者。則爲政府始終退讓。初則張學良持不抵抗。陷落東北半壁山河於崇朝。次則錦州告急。張學良仍節節撤退。政府旣無以整飭法紀。且復未能調其他得力軍隊以代之。而蔣中正氏北上收回失地之宣言。慷慨激昂之通電。皆成爲紙上之空言。至滬變突發。苦戰月餘之孤軍。終以後援不及而撤退。故人民所希冀於政府者。事實上早已歸於失望。</p>
<p>國人之責難政府。類都曰自九一八以來歷時半載。政府旣不備戰。復不言和。態度糢糊。迄無定見。實則自東北事發之初。政府早已趨向於「和」之一途。惟不敢負責明言和耳。外交上旣已着着失敗。軍事上則尤毫無準備。坐使禍患日亟。此則吾人不能曲予政府原宥者一也。</p>
<p>吾人試回溯過往之歷史。弱國被迫於强鄰。其能難苦奮鬥。爭得最後之勝利者固多。而迫於環境。暫時忍辱負重。順受橫逆。臥薪嘗膽終致自强者。亦有先例。惟政府以不敢負起政治上之責任。明白言和。竟不能把持外交上解决可能之機會。以致東北半壁河山。已淪於日軍之手。而遷都洛陽。則更似巳準備犧牲長江流域。爲東北之續。日軍之窮兵黷武。貪婪無厭。吾人固可斷言其必將毀滅於正義之前。然而我國國勢阽危。朝不保夕。遠東之風雲且日益緊急。設使第二次世界大戰。一旦爆發。我國於日軍長期壓迫之後。究將何以自處。此則吾人所不能曲予政府原宥者又一也。</p>
<p>日本軍閥爲欲壓其國內革命勢力。遂攻佔我東北。并進窺我長江流域。今復倡言以美與蘇聨爲假想敵。以鼓起國民一致對外之敵愾心。吾人今遵守國聨之决議。并接受友邦之斡旋。以與言和。而日本政府在事實上則已無裁抑軍閥之能力。且已一再宣示。不願第三者之干涉。是則今日之和議。果能有若何圓滿之結局。此又吾人所不能不請政府當局熟爲考慮者也。</p>
<p>最近日人一面言和。另一面則前綫軍隊。日益增多。目前已逹六萬以。上軍實之運輸。更絡繹不絕。海軍將領則更分赴長江上游。作種種軍事上之佈置。而其儼然以戰勝國自居。則足證其無和平之誠意。此又吾人所不能不請政府愼重考慮者又一也。</p>
<h3 id="c2">停戰協定要點待商 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>昨日會議形勢已和緩　　組織共同委員會通過　　惟撤兵程序爲未解决　　交付小組委員會討論　　定明晨十時再開會議停戰正式會議、昨在英總領事館祇開一次、形勢大見和緩、停戰協定草案、已大部議妥、惟日軍撤退程序一點、仍未解决、現此點已交付軍事分組委員會討論、今日星期休會、明日星期一上午十時、繼續開會、大約下星期內、可望得一總結束、</p>
<h3 id="c3">會議情形 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>昨日會議、祇開一次、自上午十時至中午十二時散會、惟軍事分組委員會、昨日午後、仍繼續開會一次、正式大會代表、我方首席代表外交次長郭泰祺·軍事代表淞滬警備司令戴戟·日方首席代表第九師團長植田謙吉·日使重光葵·軍事代表海軍參謀長島田繁太郎·關係國方面英公使藍溥森·美公使詹森·意代辦齊亞諾·至法公使韋理德仍由法使館參事卜德代表軍事分組委員會代表我方十九路軍參謀長黃强·日方陸軍參謀長田代皖一郎·關係國方面英使館軍事參贊桑希爾·美使館軍事參贊特萊斯台爾·法使館軍事參贊彭那維泰·及意使館軍事參贊法拉鐵尼·正式大會與軍事分組委員會係分別開會、分組委員會、專討論日軍撤退之細則、</p>
<h3 id="c4">會議結果 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>停戰協定草案、經三日之會議、昨巳大部議妥、第一第二兩日、議定停戰協定中之緒言及第一條條文、巳見前報、昨晨會議、討論第三條、即組織共同委員會一點、經兩小時之討論、巳告决定、因此點無甚困難、故會塲空氣、十分和緩、共同委員會之組織及職權、均巳議定、該委員會之組織、除中日代表外、并加入參與此次談判之四友邦、其職權則規定爲證明雙方履行撤兵、並不干涉撤退區域之行政、共同委員會人選問題、昨日尙未决定、大致由中日各國遴派文武官員各一人參加、我方將爲郭次長及黃參謀長、日方重光公使及田代參謀長、關係國方面、英美法意四使及四國軍事參贊、昨日會議、除通過停戰協定第三條外、並將附件商定、即協定係用中日英三國文字、如有疑義、則以英文爲標準、</p>
<h3 id="c5">撤兵程序 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>停戰協定中第二條、即日軍撤退程序一點、最關重要、亦最難解决、前日會議、幾至破裂者、亦即此點、昨日會議、雙方意見、雖已稍見接近、但仍無何種具體决定、後由重光公使提議、另組軍事小組委員會討論、該委員會之代表、已見上文、昨日會議兩次、第一次、自上午十時三十分至十二時一刻、第二次、自下午三時至五時一刻、日軍初主張撤退至眞茹大塲楊行獅子林、此種主張、係日方討價還價性質、本報昨已言之、昨日分組委員會會議時、日方果已變更主張、要求改以閘北江灣殷翔吳淞、爲日軍退駐區域、其理由則爲日軍五萬人、馬數千匹、大小砲百餘尊、租界不足容納、惟我方堅持停戰原則第二項、要求日軍先行盡量退至公共租界及虹口區域租界外之各路、如不足容納、則一部分可暫駐於與上述區域毘連之地段、惟吳淞江灣閘北等處、範圍太大、非租界毘連地段、故不能同意、雙方因於「毘連地段」一句、反覆討論、仍無結果、定明日上午十時、繼續開會討論、</p>
<h3 id="c6">會議公報 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>昨日會議公報云、停戰會議本日午前十時、繼續舉行、對於共同委員會之組織及職權、曾經議定、該項共同委員會之組織、除中日代表外、并加入參與此次談判之四友邦代表、以證明雙方撤兵之後履行、軍事小組委員會、繼續討論撤兵之細則、大會則午刻休會後、須至下星期一晨、始再舉行云、</p>
<h3 id="c7">會議論點 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>聞會議席上、我方代表對日方論點、曾有說明、大意謂、日方主旨所在、似偏重停戰一層、實則停戰久已實行今之所論、應注重日方撤兵、以求停戰之完成與確定、若仍如日方之從事停止敵對之研討、不啻一味開倒車、抺煞目前事實、且日方所有主張、與國聨議會决議案及雙方所接受之協定草案、大有出入、日方應加注意、我方不能遷就云云、聞日方對此意頗能了解、後討論協定草案第三項及附件、雙方均無異議、即予通過、</p>
<p>[P郭氏談話&gt;</p>
<p>關於會議消息、各方代表、對外是否應守秘密、記者昨以此點詢問郭泰祺氏、郭氏答稱、此次會議、係根據國聨議會决議而產生、爲全世界所注目、自不能認爲一種秘密會議、前數日因無具體决定、且欲避免枝節妨碍會議進行、故每次會議、由會議中草擬一簡單公報、交各報發表、但會塲上若有特殊消息、或有與本會議根本精神相反之主張、足以推翻會議之目的、者關係方面、自應酌量宣布、以釋羣疑、尤以我方代表言行一致、光明正大、無事不可公諸於世、更無所用其秘密、</p>

<h3 id="c91">綠氣徵· <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>綠氣爲一七七四年瑞典人社利Scheele氏所發見：其色黃綠，故在一八一O年，蓋呂殺克GayLussac氏以希臘字Chlor名之，即黃綠色之意義。其密度約二倍半於空氣，故較空氣濃厚也。並有一種强烈剌鼻之臭，吾人多嗅之則傷肺，甚至因毒而死；故製綠氣時，極須注意。今將其製法與用途述之。</p>
<p>但未製綠氣以前，先以器具與藥品書明於後，</p>
<p>火酒燈一只；闊口燒瓶一只，橡皮塞一個須鑽二洞；長頸漏斗一只；雙曲彎玻璃管一根；小口玻璃瓶一只。濃鹽酸，二氣化錳各少許。</p>
<p>綠氣製法　先以長頸漏斗穿入一孔中；彎玻璃管穿於他孔中，乃置於桌上，再取二氣化錳置於燒瓶內而，後以瓶塞緊塞之。取濃鹽酸從漏斗內灌入，使其侵沒二氣化錳。此時須注意者，即長頸漏斗在瓶內之管口，必須浸在鹽酸中，而曲玻璃管之口，不可浸在鹽酸中，其口須在燒瓶內之空處；其他一口，則通入一小口之瓶內，此瓶即儲綠氣之用。各物地位放妥後；乃以燈在燒瓶下加熱；瓶內發生綠氣，不多時儲氣瓶內即有黃綠色之氣體，稍待其色亦漸深，即瓶內綠氣增多矣。儲瓶之口係置時向上，因綠氣較空氣重，故在起初可放心，綠氣不會騰出。但到後來瓶內空氣驅完，綠氣濃厚，則其必欲從口而出；故此製法最好在通風處製之。此製法之方程式如下：</p>
<p>4HCL+Mn02↓CL2+MnCl2　　鹽酸二氣化錳　綠氣　氣化錳+2H2O水　　其他尙有較難之製法，不再贅述。　　綠氣之用途　製紙時用之原料，如木材，竹頭，　，及檻褸之纖維質，皆利用綠氣之間接氣化，性以漂白之；染色用之木棉纖維之漂白，亦用綠氣。其他如消毒殺菌等之用：及戰爭上之毒氣，亦有綠氣，不過使其冷至攝氏表負三十四度以下，變成濃厚之黃綠色油狀液態，而貯於鋼製圓筒中·</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Government Indeed Seeks Peace <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The so-called ceasefire conference has now formally begun under the mediation of friendly nations. Although it is currently in a state of uncertainty due to inevitable diplomatic twists and turns, the reality is clear to our countrymen: the government is heading towards peace.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the September 18th Incident, we repeatedly urged the government to make a long-term commitment to resistance. However, the reality shown to us was that the government consistently retreated. First, Zhang Xueliang adopted a policy of non-resistance, losing half of the Northeast in a single day. Then, when Jinzhou was in critical danger, Zhang Xueliang continued to retreat step by step. The government not only failed to enforce discipline but also failed to send other capable troops to replace them. Chiang Kai-shek's declarations to go north and recover lost territories, his impassioned telegrams, all became empty words on paper. When the Shanghai Incident suddenly broke out, the isolated army that fought bitterly for over a month eventually retreated due to insufficient reinforcements. Therefore, the people's hopes for the government had already turned to disappointment.</p>
<p>The people's criticism of the government mostly says that for half a year since the September 18th Incident, the government has neither prepared for war nor spoken of peace, its attitude vague and lacking a definite position. In fact, from the very beginning of the Northeast Incident, the government was already heading towards "peace," but it did not dare to explicitly state it. Diplomacy has repeatedly failed, and military preparations have been completely lacking, causing the disaster to worsen day by day. This is the first thing that we cannot excuse the government for.</p>
<p>Let us look back at history. Many weak countries, forced by powerful neighbors, have been able to struggle arduously and win the final victory. There are also precedents of countries that, forced by circumstances, temporarily endured humiliation, accepted adversity, practiced self-discipline, and ultimately became strong. However, the government, because it dared not take political responsibility and explicitly talk about peace, failed to seize the possible opportunities for diplomatic solutions, leading to the fall of half of the Northeast into the hands of the Japanese army. Moving the capital to Luoyang seems even more like preparing to sacrifice the Yangtze River region as a continuation of the Northeast. We can certainly assert that the Japanese army's aggressive militarism and insatiable greed will be destroyed by justice. However, our country's situation is precarious, and the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly urgent. If a second world war breaks out, how will our country, after long-term oppression by the Japanese army, be able to cope? This is another thing that we cannot excuse the government for.</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords, in order to suppress the revolutionary forces within their country, occupied our Northeast and are now eyeing our Yangtze River region. Now, they are even advocating the United States and the Soviet Union as hypothetical enemies to stir up national animosity towards foreign enemies. We are now complying with the League of Nations' resolutions and accepting the mediation of friendly nations to negotiate peace. However, the Japanese government, in fact, has no ability to restrain the warlords and has repeatedly declared that it does not want third-party interference. Therefore, what kind of satisfactory outcome can today's peace talks have? This is another thing that we must ask the government authorities to carefully consider.</p>
<p>Recently, while the Japanese are talking about peace on one hand, on the other hand, their frontline troops are increasing daily, now reaching over 60,000. The transport of military supplies is endless. Naval officers are even going to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to make various military arrangements. Their attitude of acting as a victorious nation proves that they have no sincerity for peace. This is yet another thing that we must ask the government to seriously consider.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Key Points of the Ceasefire Agreement Awaiting Discussion <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting Atmosphere Eased - Organization of Joint Committee Passed - However, Troop Withdrawal Procedures Unresolved - Referred to Subcommittee for Discussion - Meeting Scheduled to Resume Tomorrow at 10 AM. The formal ceasefire conference was held only once yesterday at the British Consulate General. The atmosphere greatly eased. Most of the draft ceasefire agreement has been agreed upon, but the point of Japanese troop withdrawal procedures remains unresolved. This point has now been referred to the military subcommittee for discussion. Today is a holiday. The meeting will continue at 10 AM on Monday. It is expected that a general conclusion can be reached within the next week.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Meeting Situation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's meeting was held only once, adjourning from 10 AM to 12 PM. However, the military subcommittee continued to meet once in the afternoon. The formal meeting representatives were: from our side, Chief Representative Guo Taiqi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Military Representative Dai Ji, Commander of the Songhu Garrison; from the Japanese side, Chief Representative Ueda Kenkichi, Commander of the 9th Division, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru, and Military Representative Shimada Shigetaro, Chief of Naval Staff; from the related countries, British Minister Lampson, American Minister Johnson, and Italian Chargé d'affaires Ciano. French Minister Wilden was still represented by Bodard, Counselor of the French Embassy. The representatives of the military subcommittee were: from our side, Huang Qiang, Chief of Staff of the 19th Route Army; from the Japanese side, Tanabe Waichiro, Chief of Staff of the Army; from the related countries, Sandys Hill, Military Attaché of the British Embassy, Talles Tell, Military Attaché of the American Embassy, Benavites, Military Attaché of the French Embassy, and Faratini, Military Attaché of the Italian Embassy. The formal meeting and the military subcommittee held separate meetings. The subcommittee focused on discussing the details of the Japanese troop withdrawal.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Meeting Results <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The draft ceasefire agreement was largely agreed upon yesterday after three days of meetings. On the first and second days, the introduction and Article 1 of the ceasefire agreement were agreed upon, as reported previously. Yesterday morning's meeting discussed Article 3, namely the establishment of a joint committee. After two hours of discussion, a decision was reached. Because this point did not present much difficulty, the atmosphere at the meeting was very harmonious. The organization and powers of the joint committee have been agreed upon. The organization of the committee will include representatives from China and Japan, as well as the four friendly nations that participated in the negotiations. Its powers are stipulated as verifying the implementation of troop withdrawal by both sides and not interfering with the administration of the withdrawn areas. The issue of personnel for the joint committee has not yet been decided yesterday. It is generally expected that each country will send one civil and one military official to participate. Our side will be Vice Minister Guo and Chief of Staff Huang, the Japanese side will be Ambassador Shigemitsu and Chief of Staff Tanabe, and from the related countries, the four ministers from Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, and the four countries' military attachés. Yesterday's meeting, in addition to passing Article 3 of the ceasefire agreement, also agreed on the annexes, namely that the agreement will be in Chinese, English, and Japanese, and that in case of doubt, English will be the standard.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Troop Withdrawal Procedures <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Article 2 of the ceasefire agreement, namely the Japanese troop withdrawal procedures, is the most important and most difficult to resolve. The point that almost caused the meeting to break down the day before yesterday was also this. Although the opinions of both sides were slightly closer at yesterday's meeting, no concrete decision was made. Later, Ambassador Shigemitsu proposed forming another military subcommittee for discussion. The representatives of the committee have been mentioned above. Yesterday's meeting was held twice. The first time was from 10:30 AM to 12:15 PM, and the second time was from 3 PM to 5:15 PM. The Japanese initially proposed withdrawing to Zhenru, Dachang, Yanghang, and Shizilin. This proposal was of a bargaining nature on the Japanese side, as this newspaper has already stated yesterday. During the subcommittee meeting yesterday, the Japanese side had indeed changed its proposal, requesting to change the areas where the Japanese troops would be stationed to Zhabei, Jiangwan, Yinxiang, and Wusong. The reason given was that the concession was not enough to accommodate 50,000 Japanese troops, thousands of horses, and over a hundred large and small cannons. However, our side insisted on the second principle of the ceasefire, requesting that the Japanese troops first withdraw as much as possible to the public concession and the roads outside the Hongkou concession. If it was not enough to accommodate them, then a portion could temporarily be stationed in the areas adjacent to the aforementioned areas. However, Wusong, Jiangwan, and Zhabei are too large in scope and are not adjacent to the concession, so they could not agree. The two sides repeatedly discussed the phrase "adjacent areas" but still had no results. It was decided to continue the meeting at 10 AM tomorrow to discuss this further.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Meeting Communiqué <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's meeting communiqué stated that the ceasefire conference continued to be held at 10 AM today. The organization and powers of the joint committee have been agreed upon. The organization of the joint committee will include representatives from China and Japan, as well as representatives from the four friendly nations that participated in the negotiations, to verify the implementation of troop withdrawal by both sides. The military subcommittee continued to discuss the details of the troop withdrawal. The plenary session adjourned at noon and will not reconvene until Monday morning, it said.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Meeting Discussion Points <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>It is heard that at the meeting, our representative made a statement on the Japanese side's arguments, the gist of which was: the Japanese side's main point seems to be focused on the ceasefire itself. In fact, the ceasefire has long been implemented. What is being discussed now should focus on the Japanese side's troop withdrawal in order to achieve and confirm the ceasefire. If the Japanese side is still engaged in discussions on the cessation of hostilities, it is tantamount to reversing the situation and negating the current facts. Moreover, all the Japanese side's proposals are greatly inconsistent with the League of Nations' resolution and the draft agreement accepted by both sides. The Japanese side should pay attention to this. Our side cannot compromise, it was said. It is heard that the Japanese side was able to understand this point quite well. Later, Article 3 of the draft agreement and the annexes were discussed, and both sides had no objections and passed them.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Mr. Guo's Remarks <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the news of the meeting, should the representatives of all parties maintain secrecy to the outside world? The reporter asked Guo Taiqi about this point yesterday. Guo replied that this meeting was generated based on the League of Nations' resolution and is being watched by the world. It cannot be considered a secret meeting. In the past few days, because there was no concrete decision and to avoid trivial matters hindering the progress of the meeting, a simple communiqué was drafted during each meeting and submitted to the newspapers for publication. However, if there are special news at the meeting, or if there are claims that are fundamentally contrary to the spirit of this meeting, sufficient to overturn the purpose of the meeting, the parties concerned should carefully announce them to dispel public doubts. Especially our representatives are consistent in word and deed, upright and aboveboard, and there is nothing that cannot be made public, so there is no need for secrecy.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Public Expression <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of National Salvation Organizations held its ninth council meeting yesterday. Li Cishan presided over the meeting. After the discussion, representatives were sent to Gu Weijun, Guo Taiqi, and Dai Ji with a letter saying: "Dear Sirs, today the newspapers in Shanghai published that during yesterday's Sino-Japanese ceasefire and troop withdrawal meeting, the Japanese representative proposed that Zhenru, Yanghang, and Shizilin be the defensive line where Japanese troops would be stationed after withdrawal. The Chinese representative believed that this proposal violated the principle of Japanese troop withdrawal agreed upon by the representatives of both sides at the last preparatory meeting, as well as the letter and spirit of the League of Nations General Assembly resolution, and firmly refused, intending to leave the meeting immediately. This shows that your representatives are still able to respect public opinion and not succumb to Japanese violence. We deeply admire your perseverance. Our association is willing to represent the three million people of Shanghai as your representatives' backing. If the negotiations unfortunately break down, the responsibility should naturally be borne by Japan. The people will also not hesitate to make any sacrifices to deal with it together. We hope that you will continue to work hard, persevere to the end, and not give up. However, recognizing that Chinese troops will remain in their current positions, so that the territorial sovereignty of the territory after the withdrawal of Japanese troops will not be immediately restored due to the withdrawal of troops, cannot but be said to contain major harm. We still hope that your representatives will pay close attention to this point and urgently seek remedies, so as to live up to the expectations of the people. We are sending this letter to you."</p>

<p>The South Railway Station was also heavily guarded yesterday morning. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Commission, had previously telegraphed Zheng Baozhao, Director of the Two Railway Transportation Bureaus, to take good care of the delegates. Therefore, Director Zheng led railway staff to cordially greet them yesterday morning. The Public Security Bureau also sent a squadron of security guards to protect the station. Our representatives Dr. Gu Shaochuan, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and Director Wen Yinxing personally went to the station to bid farewell. Dr. Gu had a deep conversation with the delegates. Then, amidst the resounding music, the delegates boarded the train one after another. Major General McCoy was in the front, followed by General Clauzel and Dr. Schnee, followed by the secretaries of the delegation, and finally Wang Guangqi and dozens of others.</p>

<p>The "De He" was docked at the Jardine Matheson Wharf on Broadway Road. At around 9 AM yesterday morning, the Public Works Bureau sent fully armed Chinese and Western detectives to guard the wharf, patrol the streets, and prohibit idlers from wandering. At around 10 AM, Lord Lytton, Chairman of the Investigation Team, Italian Representative Count Codi, our representative Gu Weijun, Japanese representative Yoshida, and their entourage arrived one after another. Then, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, and Public Security Bureau Director Wen Yinxing took a patrol boat to the wharf, boarded the "De He," and met with Lytton and Codi, expressing their warm welcome. Lytton and Codi expressed their gratitude. Mayor Wu then shook hands with Representative Gu and others and disembarked.

<p>After dealing with everyone, Lord Lytton sat alone in a corner of the dining room, reading incoming and outgoing letters, looking thoughtful. The photographers gathered around the Lord and waited for the photo to be taken. The Lord seemed unaware of it. After reading the official documents, he took a walk on the bow. Italian Representative Codi had a foot ailment and had difficulty walking. After boarding the ship, he instructed his staff to place a rattan mat on the deck in the first cabin, and he lay on it. When someone talked to him, he nodded slightly to rest. Wang Jingqi, the former Minister to Belgium, visited Codi. Wang said that he was going to Beijing on the same ship and then to Luoyang to attend the National Crisis Conference. Codi strongly urged him to go to the Northeast and asked in detail about the situation before the convening of the National Crisis Conference. Wang told him everything.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Mr. Gu's Remarks <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter had the following conversation with Gu Weijun, representative of the National Government, on the "De He": (Reporter asked) The Sino-Japanese ceasefire talks have been deadlocked on troop withdrawal. Can you tell us the reason? (Gu replied) The Sino-Japanese ceasefire talks are being held entirely in accordance with the League of Nations resolution. There are no major difficulties in accordance with the original purpose of the meeting. However, the Japanese side does not follow the League of Nations' wishes at the meeting. The meeting has been held again and again for days, but no result has been reached. In short, our side is determined not to discuss political issues. If it goes beyond the original purpose of troop withdrawal and the meeting breaks down as a result, the responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side. The reporter then asked, if the meeting breaks down, what will our side do? Gu replied, we will report the situation and the various demands of the Japanese side that go beyond the scope to the committee of nineteen countries organized by the League of Nations to stop them. Finally, Mr. Gu said to the reporter that he was not very clear about the situation of the ceasefire talks because he was hosting the League of Nations Investigation Team this time. However, our diplomatic authorities have repeatedly stated that they will never sign humiliating conditions. If the Japanese side really wants to show goodwill to China, it must withdraw the invading troops stationed in China.</p>

<p>After Minister of Finance Song Ziwen bid farewell to the three commissioners of the Investigation Team at the South Railway Station at 9 AM yesterday, he was originally scheduled to take the "De He" to Nanjing with Lord Lytton and others. Now, due to other important business, he changed his plan and took a train from the South Railway Station to Hangzhou at 3:10 PM yesterday. This morning, he will take a car to Beijing with the Investigation Team. Also, former Shanghai Mayor Zhang Yi did not catch up because he saw off the Investigation Team to the South Railway Station. Therefore, he took the 40th slow train to Hangzhou at 11 AM yesterday.</p>

<p>Because the League of Nations Investigation Team was scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday, and there was limited time, the Shanghai Women's Rights Movement League did not have time to hold a welcome meeting. They sent representatives Shen Yibin, Huang Shaolan, Zhang Jingzhuang, Song Lichen, Xu Zheng, etc. to the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road at 12 PM the day before yesterday. The five representatives of the Investigation Team, including Lord Lytton, jointly received them. Shen and others gave a welcome speech in Chinese and English, expressing their hope that the Investigation Team would maintain the credibility of the League of Nations based on justice and fairness. They should know that the brutality of Japan's undeclared war not only destroyed peace in China, but also destroyed world peace, and should not escape the judgment of the world. After the speech, Lord Lytton inquired in detail about the organization of the Women's Rights Movement League and the progress of Chinese women in obtaining political rights and inheritance rights, as well as their connections with international women's organizations, expressing deep respect. After talking for about ten minutes, they excused themselves to leave because there were other groups to meet.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Recent Situation After Japanese Troops Landed in Liuhe <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Still Actively Preparing for War After our troops retreated to the second line of defense, due to traffic congestion, the situation on the front line is not very clear. Yesterday, the reporter met a friend from Liuhe in Shanghai, who told us about the situation in the area. They are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Our Troops' Withdrawal Process <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Since the night of January 28, after the Japanese troops attacked Zhabei, Liuhe, bordering the Yangtze River, was of great importance in terms of defense. The authorities also sent a small number of troops to defend it, and there was also a local defense group to assist in civil defense, which was fairly stable. The Feng Da Yi Yong Jun of fifty or sixty people soon arrived in Liu, and immediately opened a trench twenty miles from the northern head of Liuhe (i.e., Yanglinkou) to set up defenses. From February 23, Japanese planes often went to Liuhe and Yanglin for reconnaissance. More than a dozen Japanese warships were anchored in the harbor area, but there were no special actions. Residents were not very alarmed. However, on the morning of the 1st of this month, about two or three hundred Japanese troops, under the cover of Japanese warships' artillery, planned to land at Yanglinkou in the hazy light of dawn. They were detected and repelled by our troops. At the same time, seven Japanese sailing boats at the mouth of Liuhe also sailed into the port and were destroyed by our troops. Several boats collapsed and retreated. At that time, more than a dozen Japanese planes continued to drop bombs in the sky, disturbing the defense line. Our troops were brave and did not move. Residents, seeing their houses destroyed by Japanese planes' bombing, were greatly frightened and fled one after another. At around 3 PM on the 1st, cars carrying 500 reinforcements arrived from Shanghai, and immediately went to the port to increase defenses. At 8 PM, another 1,000 or so soldiers arrived. It is said that these troops were all from the 88th Division. After the troops arrived, they did not go to the defense line, but set off towards Xitang and Taicang around 10 PM that night. At the same time, the port defense troops, the defense group, and the defense line in Yanglinkou successively retreated. By 2 AM, all of our troops had retreated.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Japanese Troops Land at Yanglin <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Many Japanese planes dropped bombs in the Liuhe and Yanglin area on the 1st, and Japanese warships fired cannons all day long, destroying countless houses. People were suddenly frightened. From morning to dusk, they fled one after another, supporting the old and carrying the young. From Liuhe to Taicang, which is more than thirty miles away, the road was continuous, and the sound of crying shook the sky. It was an unprecedented tragic situation. The town was completely deserted, but the Japanese troops still did not know it. On the afternoon of the 2nd, the Japanese troops landed from Yanglinkou, only a hundred or so people. At around 4 PM, more than sixty Japanese troops in Liuhe opened in the west city (i.e., those coming from Yanglin) and did not dare to enter the town. They hesitated for a while and then entered after realizing there was no movement. At the same time, more than twenty Japanese troops landed at the mouth of Liuhe.</p>

<p>After the Japanese troops entered the town, Dong and Chuan greeted them. Chen Liansheng and his son Dachai were taken away by the Japanese troops to be guides, leading the Japanese troops to Xintang, Liuduqiao, and other places, and leading the Japanese troops to the countryside to beat chickens and collect eggs, causing the nearby villages to be disturbed. Recently, Hu, the owner of San Tailong South Goods Store, and Shi Shangda, the owner of Datong Store, organized a maintenance association. Residents in Liuhe are issued permits by the maintenance association to liaise with the Japanese troops. The Shimei Matsukaze Bathhouse and the Xinfukou Wanyang Teahouse were reopened, specializing in bathing and tea for the Japanese troops. The people were very angry at the pro-Japanese behavior of Hu and others.</p>
<h3 id="e29">A Glimpse of the Destruction in Liuhe <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Starting from the 1st, over ten Japanese planes continuously bombed, destroying countless villages in the surrounding countryside. Within Liuhe Town, Yongfeng Candle Shop in Fuqiao Alley, Hengkang Silver Shop, five or six stores on Miaoqian Street starting from Juxingxuan Dim Sum Shop to Wanyuan Foreign Goods Store, Jiqing Tea House on the North Riverbank, and the residence of Wang Shaoqing in Nishan Bay were all destroyed by bombing. The storage of the Shanghai-Taicang Bus Station and the nearby house of Wang Agui were also bombed. The ticket office of the bus station still stands. Although other places were affected, the damage was not significant. A bomb landed in front of the Guandi Temple but did not explode. The new floating bridge, the old floating bridge, the Xinzha bridge, and the Yifang Garden were all safe and sound. Previous reports of the destruction of two bridges were inaccurate. On North Street in the town, the Japanese opened a small shop specializing in selling eggs and cigarettes. It is said that all the cigarettes are "Fairy" brand.</p>

<p>After our troops retreated, bandits hid in the surrounding countryside. Seeing that the Japanese troops did not commit atrocities after entering the town, they became active. The five salt warehouses of the Zhenhe North East Market Office, Zhang Yuantai, were all robbed of their stored salt by bandits and villagers, resulting in losses of over one million yuan. The Japanese troops did not care about the bandits seizing property.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Recent Situation of Japanese Troops <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese troops invaded Liuhe, they were led by guides to Xintang Market and Ludu Bridge and other places to be stationed. The headquarters was set up in a foreign-style house of a certain family opposite the Guandi Temple in Nanshi, and Shaohesheng Cake Shop on the South Riverbank was used as a supply depot. Recently, a large amount of military supplies was brought by Japanese warships, and towed by gasoline boats from the port. In addition to machine guns, field artillery, and steel cannons, no tanks or gun vehicles were seen. The previous report that Liuhe was setting up an airfield has not been seen to be carried out. Only one or two planes were occasionally parked on the open space in front of the bus station, which is likely a rumor. Currently, the front line of the Japanese troops is three Chinese miles away from our troops from Fuqiao Qiyakou to the southeast Xitang, southwest Xintang Market, Zhangjia Bridge, Yangjia Bridge, Ludu Bridge, and Loutang. Recently, Japanese troops have been actively preparing for war at Ludu Bridge, digging trenches very busily, and forcing villagers to work. It is said that there are more than 15,000 Japanese troops from Fuqiao to Ludu Bridge. For the transportation of Japanese troops from Liuhe to Ludu Bridge, in addition to land routes, more than ten gasoline boats are used for transportation.</p>
<p>The Corpse of Tenhisa Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>The remains of Mr. Tenhisa, the staff officer who died in battle at the Wusong Fortress of the Yong'an Cemetery, were transported to Song by his family in a coffin yesterday for encoffining, and then the coffin was transported by wheel to Shanghai and buried in the Yong'an Cemetery on Hubble Lane. The Guizhou compatriots in Shanghai decided to petition the central government for condolences to the Tenhisa family and hold a memorial service on a selected day to comfort the loyal soul. The Yinqian business will maintain various industries' finances.</p>
<p>Transactions Must be in Cash as Much as Possible. In order to adjust the finances, the silver and money industries in this city have established a joint reserve committee for the silver industry, and a property custody committee for the money industry. The prepared property is very sufficient, and loans are cautiously made to trading merchants. In order to prevent cash outflow, the money industry has added the seal "This ticket is only allowed for inter-industry remittance" to long-term promissory notes, and the disbursement slips of Chinese banks and various account holders are also remitted by the same industry. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received letters from the silk and tea industries, stating that at a time when all industries are suspended, the inability of finance to circulate as usual makes it impossible for various industries to operate. It has sent letters to the silver and money industry trade associations, requesting that merchants with good credit be given financial turnover as usual. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically visited the leaders of the silver and money industries yesterday. According to them, the silver and money industries, for all industries, if they must want to ship goods to foreign firms and food, silk, tea, etc. that must be in cash, can negotiate with their own banks or money houses for appropriate use. Moreover, once the situation is calm, the above measures will be restored to the original state before January 28.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Incident, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Wusong and other places were all trampled by wooden clogs. Therefore, shops in the Public Concession, the French Concession, Nanshi, and Pudong all went on strike to resist the enemy. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that the government has established a long-term resistance plan against Japan's aggression. Our rear merchants and people, in order to stabilize order, adjust finance, and respect,</p>
<h2>Page 2</h2>
<p>Respect the advice of the League of Nations investigation team, should open the market immediately to await the judgment of justice. The Municipal Federation, the General Federation of Commercial Circles of Various Roads, and the Federation of Commercial Circles of the French Concession believe that the shops have made huge sacrifices for the sake of the nation and the nation.</p>
<p>It is urgent to work hard to maintain the commerce and the relief of the rear. However, there must be concrete measures for opening the market at least. Moreover, the rent problem is also an important issue at present. Therefore, it is specifically scheduled to hold an emergency joint meeting at the Municipal Federation on Xinzha Road at 4 pm today to discuss the measures. A notice was issued yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Various Trade Associations Sent Letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Open the Market as Soon as Possible <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Please Print a Concise Notice and Distribute it to Various Stores for Posting. Shanghai Municipal Cotton Cloth Industry, Xinle Industry, Yarn Industry, Silk Industry, Feihua Industry, Sugar Industry, Luo Ma Bag Industry, Mineral Ash Factory Industry, Color Printing Industry, Electrical Appliance Industry, and other trade associations sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting to open the market as soon as possible and requesting to print concise notices and distribute them to various stores for posting. The article said, "The original intention of the initial strike to resist the enemy was to express resistance to the enemy. It is certainly not possible to control the enemy by striking. Our government has repeatedly declared long-term resistance. Our people should also make long-term preparations in terms of economy, so that the national treasury is full and the people's strength is abundant, so that the purpose of long-term resistance can be thoroughly implemented. Shanghai is the center of the country's industry and commerce, and the foundation of the country's economic lifeline. If there is a long-term strike, it is no different from abandoning its economic power and being taken advantage of by the enemy. Your association once notified that the market would open on March 1, but it failed to be universally followed due to the different opinions of a few citizens. When your association was on strike, it printed concise notices and distributed them to various stores for posting, but for the proposal to open the market, there was no such notice other than newspaper advertisements, making it known to every household. It is also one of the reasons why it failed to be unanimous. For the sake of today's plan, the strike cannot be prolonged, and the opening of the market should be strived for unanimity. It seems that your association should print concise notices and distribute them to various stores for posting, so that everyone can know and follow. As for the recovery of local vitality after the war, the suspension of business for two months has been a long time. How to deal with debts and claims, and how to manage the payment of goods and rents should be comprehensively planned and carefully planned by your association to gradually make up for the loss, so that industry and commerce can be at ease in business and prepare economically for the country's long-term resistance. We should correspond and handle it."</p>

<h3 id="e37">The Case of the Traitor Supplying Rice to the Japanese Army <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Wang Asong is Patriotic and Innocent; Two Thieves Separately Imprisoned Yang Zhou, Wang Asong, because on the morning of the 19th of last month at about 10 o'clock, he detected that a certain traitor was supplying a cart of rice to the Japanese army, passing by Yuanfang Road, so he went to send the cart of military rice to the Public Security Bureau of the two cities by the car driver Zhou Tonggen. At that time, Yangzhou people Lin Xuejun, Shaoxing people Xia Zhuangyuan,</p>
<p>took the opportunity to steal quilts, blankets and other items on the car and fled. Later, Zhou Tian, the Japanese handling the food rice, reported that the Huishan Patrol House sent three Chinese and Western detectives to detain Wang and others to the First Special Zone Court for interrogation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper yesterday morning. Judge Xiao continued to interrogate the court. Wang Asong was questioned, insisting that this was a temporary enthusiasm and anger, so he asked Zhou Tonggen to send the rice to the Public Security Bureau, and there was no theft. How could there be six bags missing at that time? I don't know the details. The two defendants, Lin and Xia, admitted that the order was chaotic at the time and they picked up quilts and blankets on the ground. According to the Japanese Tianzheng, the rice was a total of four cars, each car containing 25 bags, and was sent to the Second Public Great Yarn Factory on Yangshupu Road. As a result, one car was missing. This rice was shipped from Qingdao Dalian to Shanghai. The lawyer Zhang of the Patrol House claimed that the Patrol House initially prosecuted the defendant Wang Asong for theft, but now it cannot be established. Because he was moved by patriotic enthusiasm, the Patrol House adopts a fair attitude and takes care of the law. For the defendant, whether Chinese or Japanese, it does not discriminate. Please release Wang. As for the two defendants, Lin and Xia, they should be punished appropriately. Wang Asong's agent lawyers Wu Linkun and Fan Gangsui claimed that the statements made by the Patrol House lawyer Zhang are very fair and admirable. However, the rice was not shipped from Qingdao, and the doubts and evidence of the Japanese side are deeply unreliable. In short, Wang Asong was out of patriotism and cannot be considered a crime. Please release him immediately. Judge Xiao verified the confession and sentenced Wang Asong not guilty, Lin Xuejun to one year imprisonment, and Xia Zhuangyuan to six months imprisonment. Before the judgment was final, the number of days of detention was used to offset one day of imprisonment for two days. The lawyer Zhang of the Patrol House claimed that Wang Asong should be handed over to ordinary guarantees so that he could be summoned for inquiry during the appeal period, and the court approved it.</p>

<p>The fellow villagers of Hubei in Shanghai stated that General Xia Douyin, formerly in the post of garrison commander, quelled bandits, rescued disasters, and maintained public security. His political achievements were outstanding. The central government has decided to appoint him as a member and chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government. Recently, he came to Shanghai on official business. He held a public banquet at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Simar Road the day before yesterday to welcome him. In addition to Chairman Xia, there were also Wang Shaochang, Guan Jingzhi, Liu Wanhua, Gao Jianqing, Li Yaoqin, Lu Xingjie, Sun Songnian, Liu Shixiong, Du Xiangqing, Wang Shutang, Ming Runzhen, Zheng Shaokun, Liang Zhonghao, Liu Chen, Wang Weiqing, and other fifty people. They took their seats at 5 o'clock. Guan Jingzhi stood up to deliver a speech, saying, "In recent years, banditry has been rampant in various counties of Jin and E, and floods have been extremely severe. The people have no means of living, and the affairs of the people have been abandoned, resulting in financial exhaustion and industrial and commercial difficulties. Hundreds of thousands of disaster victims are in urgent need of resettlement. Now that Zai Xia Bing, the army commander, has been appointed as the chairman of the province, the fellows admire General Xia's high moral character. They cannot help but celebrate the fact that the politics of Hubei Province have gained people's hearts. The fellows believe that he will be able to implement benevolent policies in Wuhan to the entire Hubei. In the future, in the areas of financial construction, education, industry, and bandit suppression in Hubei, he will be able to seek development based on facts. In particular, he hopes that the administration of officials will be strictly rectified, and all politics and governance can be achieved by obtaining people and lifting them up. On behalf of the fellow villagers in Shanghai, I respectfully offer a glass to wish Chairman Xia a long life. After that, Chairman Xia replied, "President Wang of the Executive Yuan believes that the constitutional period is approaching and military and civilian governance should be implemented separately. This time, I was appointed as the chairman of this province, focusing on eliminating banditry. I repeatedly declined but was not allowed. All parties have also blamed me for the great righteousness of my hometown, so I have to take it reluctantly. Fortunately, the committee members of the provincial government are all here to reorganize the provincial government, and there is no selfishness in seeking fame and wealth. As for the elders and brothers of this province, they all hope to be well-governed, and they will be able to cooperate sincerely, which is a good phenomenon. The administration of officials must focus on virtuous talents and integrity. Banditry should be punished and persuaded at the same time to eliminate the roots, so that the people can live and work in peace and contentment. Finance should be open, reduce expenditures and increase revenue, and the general term is that the money will not be wasted and the people will bear the burden. Relief work should be carried out vigorously, dredging rivers and building embankments to prevent drought and flood. To reorganize schools, improve education, and all urgently needed construction, the industries that should be handled should be paid attention to one by one. However, the most difficult thing at the moment is the financial problem. Although I don't have much confidence, I will do it according to this purpose. I am currently passing through Shanghai on official business, and I am grateful for the fellow villagers' praise." After that, the directors of the fellow villagers' association reported on the Shanghai association's fund-raising and remittance of emergency relief for the flood disaster in the province, as well as the situation of sending the compatriots who were in trouble in this military disaster back to their hometown. The banquet ended.</p>

<p>The Guangdong Overseas Chinese groups in Shanghai telegraphed Guangdong to ask for relief for the refugees. The telegram said, "Guangzhou Convenient Hospital transferred to major charity halls and newspapers. When the Japanese bandits' army acted in Shanghai, the houses were burned down. After the war, the disaster victims were full of mourning. Fellow villagers from all provinces have formed relief groups. However, our Guangdong compatriots have set up a Guangdong Fellow Villagers Relief Association, but unfortunately, the association is poorly managed. Although it has repeatedly chartered ships to transport them back to Guangdong in batches, disputes have arisen from time to time in the registration and ticket issuance procedures, causing complaints. No less than 300,000 of our fellow villagers live in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas, but this area is the first to bear the brunt, and they are displaced and bankrupt. The catastrophe they have suffered is self-evident. The Guangzhao Public Office is the general group of the two prefectures of Guangzhao. Since the Shanghai War, the office has only done some accommodation work, and other relief efforts have not been premeditated. Looking back at the establishment of the relief agencies in various provinces, the perfection of the management, and the comprehensiveness of the relief, the contrast is too great. How can we not be ashamed of death? Moreover, the war clouds are dense. If the Shanghai War reopens, if there is no premeditated relief, then our 300,000 fellow villagers in Shanghai will be reduced to bones on the edge of the field. The people of our association, with the righteousness of our hometown, and seeing the imminent disaster, are silent and unrescued, and dare to represent all the Guangdong refugees, and sincerely ask your hospital to quickly select cadres to come to Shanghai to provide practical relief, save the victims, and create boundless blessings.

Therefore, the surviving people have lamented that they have no food. When the first rescue team of the Red Swastika Society Southeast Federation departed for Dachang and Miaohang, they saw the suffering of the people and immediately gave out some rice to provide relief. They also rescued more than 20 starving refugees and sent them to the fourth shelter. There was also an injured man named Li Bingjiang who was sent to the third hospital for treatment. I sincerely hope that all sectors will provide relief to the people in the war zone.</p>

<h3 id="e46">The Case of the Disappearance of Pastor Jiang's Family <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Fei Wusheng requested an inquiry from the Da Mei Evening News's commentary on Pastor Jiang's family in the Fei Family Memorial Church at No. 17 Sealean Road, who disappeared on January 29. It is said that they were detained by the Japanese Marine Corps when they searched the church. Later, his relatives and friends searched everywhere, but there was no news. Yesterday, the Da Mei Evening News also disclosed a letter from Fei Wusheng, the general secretary of the Shanghai Western Youth Association, to Leader Consul Kningham on the 4th of this month, saying, "I am attaching six letters concerning the illegal arrest of Pastor Jiang and his family and servants of the Fei Family Memorial Church on January 29. I respectfully ask for your inspection. If Pastor Jiang and others are still alive today, I dare to ask for your great assistance to release the whole family. If they have died, please also inquire about how the corpses were disposed of, and ask the person responsible for the arrest and detention to be brought before the court. The church is the largest in Shanghai, and half of its construction funds were raised by this city, and half were donated by Americans to commemorate my parents. Its location is on Pinle'an Road, one of the roads built by the Public Works Bureau (below omitted).</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News also wrote a commentary, stating that the Japanese authorities, in addition to making two statements stating that no one was seen when the Marine Corps searched the church, in order to disclaim the responsibility of the Japanese Marine Corps for the arrest and disappearance of Pastor Jiang's family, did not seem to have investigated the whereabouts of Pastor Jiang's family. At that time, the Public Works Bureau police were prevented from exercising their duties. Even if Pastor Jiang and others were guilty, they should be given a fair and legal trial, let alone that they were innocent. Therefore, regardless of whether they are still being detained or have died, they have been subjected to illegal and unfair treatment. Whoever is responsible for this illegal and unfair treatment, they must bear full responsibility for violating the intentions of the patrol house and taking over the local administrative power. In recent years, when the lives and property of foreigners were threatened by Chinese bandits, they protested against the inaction of the Chinese authorities. The reservation of certain rights and privileges is for this reason. However, if a strong country allows foreigners to treat Chinese in the same way, and it happens within the territory managed by the concession, then the protests of Westerners in the future will be very weak. Therefore, if it is not possible to find out the whereabouts of Pastor Jiang's family with sincere efforts, then the so-called fairness of foreigners will fall below the fairness of what foreigners call the Chinese.</p>

<p>Yao Chen, wife of Yao Jinyu, a native of Ningbo residing at No. 33 Chongde Lane, Xihua Road, Hongkou, is 45 years old. Yao Jinyu used to work as a steward on Yangtze River ships. Now, with the war causing a standstill, he is unemployed at home, living by pawning his belongings. Last year, a fellow villager surnamed Wang borrowed 300 yuan from him, with a written agreement. A few days ago, Yao, out of desperation, took a ship to Ningbo to collect the debt, only to find Wang after searching everywhere. Disappointed, he returned. His wife, Chen, faced with the sudden cessation of income, conceived a desire to die. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, she secretly ingested raw opium in an act of suicide. By the time the family discovered it, they urgently hired a car to take her to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Gu Wei, wife of Gu Mingda, 24 years old, a native of Pudong who runs a tailoring shop at No. 1205 Mengjiang Lane, Wusong Road, is 25 years old. Recently, Gu gambled and did not return home all night. Wei confronted him, but to no avail. Instead, Gu, angered and ashamed, beat her on the chest. Afterwards, Wei was unusually depressed. Yesterday afternoon, around 2:15 PM, she went out and bought one yuan's worth of opium. Before long, the poison took effect, and she vomited incessantly. Apprentices took her to Tongren Hospital for treatment by car. Doctors diagnosed that she had taken poison, and her life is in grave danger.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Voices of Opposition Against the Yiyuan Dog Racing Track <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of dog racing tracks disguised as gambling venues in this city, countless people have become addicted, leading to ruined families, unemployment, and suicides. The public, recognizing the detrimental nature of this social poison, believes it is necessary to actively eradicate it. They have repeatedly requested the concession authorities to strictly prohibit it. Fortunately, the authorities of the Public Settlement deeply understood the situation and, in the summer of last year, decided to simultaneously shut down the Shenyuan and Mingyuan dog racing tracks within the settlement, prohibiting their operation. However, the Yiyuan dog racing track in the French Concession still exists. Despite repeated calls for its prohibition due to its unique position, the Yiyuan track remains independent, holding races on schedule. It temporarily suspended operations due to the impact of the war. Recently, with the gradual stabilization of the situation and the gradual shortening of the curfew in the concession, it has actively reorganized and officially resumed operations, holding races on schedule. However, the public is extremely dissatisfied with this news and reportedly intends to concentrate its efforts to launch a firm opposition to the French Concession authorities.</p>

<p>Since the January 28th Incident and the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the match factory was deemed extremely dangerous, and work was immediately suspended. After consultation between our union and the factory, it was agreed that during the suspension of work, male workers would receive 2 jiao and female workers 1 jiao for meal expenses, paid every half month, totaling 3 yuan for male workers and 1.5 yuan for female workers. Later, due to the expansion of the war and the indefinite suspension of work, the factory sent a letter on the 19th of this month, hoping to discuss the aftermath. After negotiations between labor and management on the 19th and 20th, it was decided that from April 1st, a long-term suspension of work would be announced. All workers' meal allowances would be paid until the end of March, and an additional two months' pay, totaling 15 yuan, would be given. Temporary male and female workers would each receive 2 yuan. However, yesterday's report in your newspaper stated that the factory was closing and dismissing all workers, with dismissal payments of 26 yuan for male workers and 12 yuan for female workers, which is not true. We are deeply concerned that various sectors of the public may misunderstand the truth, so we are issuing this correction. - Fifth District Match Industry Union.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 26th - According to today's newspaper reports, the Japanese government intends to formally notify the League of Nations that if the League insists on applying Article 15 of the Covenant to the Manchurian issue, Japan intends to withdraw from the League. This statement has not been officially confirmed but is believed to be not without foundation. Reliable sources have revealed that Secretary-General Drummond of the League of Nations informed the Japanese representative Sato a few days ago that the League intends to apply Article 15 to the Manchurian issue, regardless of Japan's disagreement.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 26th (Dispatch from the Japanese United Press) – The cabinet reshuffle issue has come to an end. However, the triangular relationship of the Suzuki, Kuhara, and Tokonami factions within the Seiyukai party, which experienced internal strife over this issue, remains unresolved. Furthermore, the roots of this strife seem to have a significant impact on the future political situation. When important figures such as the president of the South Manchuria Railway and the Governor-General of Korea are replaced, factional infighting will intensify. At the same time, the centrists, including Mochizuki, Yamamoto, Mido, and Ogawa, who are mediating, will also form a party to restrain the arbitrariness of each faction. Prime Minister Inukai's incompetence has been fully exposed by this issue, and it is doubtful whether he will be able to control the entire party in the future.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Dispatch from the Japanese United Press) – Seiyukai party members are increasingly opposed to President Inukai's decisive cabinet reshuffle. If this continues, it is impossible to determine what major events will occur. The neutral faction within the party is worried about the future and plans to establish a supreme advisory body to prevent the arbitrary decisions of a minority. More than 100 party members held a meeting today, and elders such as Okazaki, Nagano, and Ogawa also attended to discuss this issue. The elders' attitude has not yet been decided. Prime Minister Inukai has expressed absolute opposition to the establishment of an advisory body. The future of the Seiyukai is quite noteworthy.</p>

<p>Budget Revenues and Expenditures Cannot Maintain Balance: Hoover Urges People to Unite and Save the Nation. Washington, 26th (Dispatch from Reuters) – People with any sense are now suspicious of whether the American budget can be balanced, whether the government's credit can be maintained, and whether the United States can continue to maintain the gold standard. Since the party machinery failed to control Congress and raise 1,241,000,000 yuan through new taxes to make up for the budget deficit, the political crisis has reached its extreme. This is because the government's proposed sales tax bill, which stipulates that a tax of 2.5% be levied on every item manufactured in the United States, has been rejected by Congress. In addition, with 8 million unemployed in the country, the government expenditures of the central government, various states, and cities are all in dire straits. Therefore, Americans all feel that the United States is currently in a difficult and painful situation. Many people feel that the only remedy is to increase prices.</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (Dispatch from the Kokumin News Agency) – After the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the sales tax bill yesterday, U.S. President Hoover issued a declaration today, asking the people of the whole country to act in unison and make overall sacrifices to seek a balance in budget revenues and expenditures. He deeply believes that this difficult task must be completed, as it is the key to the nation's recovery of prosperity. He also emphasized that government expenditures must be reduced and taxes must be increased, saying that the country cannot continue to live on debt.</p>

<h3 id="e89">East Railway Locomotives Were Transported Away by Russia <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Estimated to be Several Hundred Units, of Very High Value. It is Said That Newly Purchased Surveying Cars Were Also Seized. Harbin Correspondence: Among the movable properties of the East Railway, locomotives are the most valuable. There are a total of 425 units. These 425 units are divided into three types. One is a special heavy-duty locomotive, which is structurally strong and of excellent quality, with a very large pulling force and a huge power. In times of military emergency, it can be converted into an armored train. The value of this type of locomotive is more than twice as high as that of the other two types of ordinary locomotives. The East Railway has a total of 124 units of this type, which are used exclusively for transporting grain, stone, and all kinds of heavy goods. The remaining two types are ordinary locomotives, one used to pull passenger cars and one used to reverse cars. Their structure, power, and pulling force are far inferior to the aforementioned type. This time, the Soviet Union suddenly transported away the special heavy-duty locomotives. It is heard that since the Spring Festival, the heavy-duty locomotives of the East Railway have only been seen leaving, but have not been seen returning. When inquiring with various sections, it was also impossible to find out their whereabouts. However, between the East Railway and the Soviet Union railways, such as the Ussuri Railway, only cars are allowed to pass through and accounts are recorded. As for locomotives, they are not allowed to pass through each other. Since the East Railway's heavy-duty locomotives have no whereabouts on this route, it is undoubtedly that they were driven into the territory of the Soviet Union. It is found that the East Railway's car services are divided into three sections: Boketu is the first section, Harbin is the second section, and Suifenhe is the third section. All locomotives and vehicles, except those that are dilapidated and sent to the general factory for repairs, are distributed to the three sections for application. The number belonging to Harbin (the second section) is a total of 141 locomotives, of which 71 are heavy-duty locomotives. Currently, 63 units have been driven out but have not returned and their whereabouts are unknown, with only 8 units not lost. Although the number of losses in the first and third sections is unknown, based on this example, the number should also be proportionate. In recent days, ordinary locomotives have also had the fact that they are only seen leaving but not returning. Secondly, such as the East Railway's newly purchased surveying car last year, (the weight carried by each train, the steam power used by the locomotive, the fuel used per kilometer, etc., can be immediately understood once measured by this surveying car,) the value is also very high. It is equipped with a technician who specializes in it, with a monthly salary of more than 200 yuan, which is one of the most valuable movable properties of the East Railway. It also departed from Harbin on February 20th and has been gone for two months. Its whereabouts are unknown and it has probably been driven into the Ussuri Railway. (It is heard that the technician in charge of the car, whose party color is impure, did not dare to enter Russian territory, jumped off the train at Suifen Station, and secretly escaped back to Harbin.) Furthermore, when the East Railway's material factory is shipped, there are receipts from each station for receiving goods. The question is whether the exact amount transported away and whether it is indeed used by each station. In addition, the valuable medicinal materials of the Central Hospital and the watches and clocks used by the railway are also of unknown whereabouts. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e90">Shiozawa Arrives in Hankou by Ship <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Claims He is Inspecting the Navy. Wuhan is Preparing to Welcome the Investigation Team. Hankou Correspondence: After the withdrawal of our troops from Zhabei, Shanghai, Shiozawa, the commander of the Japanese Navy who attacked Shanghai, there were rumors that he would come to Hankou to deploy military affairs. But it was delayed until recently when he sailed upstream from Shanghai on the Ataka flagship and arrived in Hankou at 2:00 PM on the 25th. The ship was moored at the naval pier in the Japanese concession. For a time, foreign warships in the center of the river all fired salutes. Japanese officials and overseas Chinese warmly welcomed him. Before the war in Shanghai, Shiozawa was stationed in Hankou, actively deploying military affairs, hoping to launch an incident, which gave the people of Wuhan a great impression. What his mission is this time is worth noting. However, the Japanese consul stationed in Hankou declared to our authorities that Shiozawa is the commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Fleet of the Japanese Navy. The Japanese warships stationed in the Yangtze River from Chongqing to Wusong are all within his inspection scope. His visit to Hankou this time is what he should have done in his duty, and he has no other mission. Moreover, Shiozawa did not bring any marines with him to Hankou. At this time of tense atmosphere in Wuhan, news suddenly came that the League of Nations investigation team would pass through Hankou on its way north. The city government has received instructions from the provincial government and is preparing to welcome them. The preparatory reception office will be established within the next few days, and celebrities will be invited to serve as hosts. Various circles also plan to hold banquets separately when the team arrives. According to the telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Gu Weijun, the team plans to go to Beijing on the 26th, come to Hankou on the 30th, and should arrive on the 2nd of next month.

<h3 id="e91">Communist Party Organ Uncovered in Jinan <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Sixty Men and Women Arrested. Jinan Correspondence: Jinan has been arresting communists on a large scale for several days, uncovering more than 30 organizations before and after, and arresting 60 principals and suspects. It is heard that the reason for its launch is that internal disputes occurred within the Communist Party. The Stalinist faction and the Trotskyist faction of the Provincial First Rural Normal School suddenly broke down. The Trotskyist faction was greatly hit, so they informed the provincial government. The provincial government ordered Mayor Wen Chenglie to order the Public Security Bureau to send police to search and arrest in separate ways. The action started at 10:00 PM on the 20th, and more than 40 people were arrested at the Little Wangfu Quehua Bridge Organization Department, the First Rural Normal School, Zhengyi Middle School, Women's Normal School, and Women's Middle School. On the 21st and 22nd, another 20 people were arrested, totaling 60 men and women, including 48 men and 12 women. Among them are 9 school teachers, 1 staff member of the Department of Industry, and 1 staff member of the Mass Education Center. The rest are all students, with students from the First Rural Normal School and Zhengyi Middle School accounting for the majority. Among the men, Yuan Chunting, a staff member of the Mass Education Center (i.e., Yuan Zhenrong), and among the women, Yuan Lanrong, a student of the Women's Normal School, are more important. The two Yuans are siblings, and it is heard that a large number of important documents were also seized. However, suspects account for the majority of these 60 people. The authorities plan to separate them and send them to the Military Law Joint Trial Committee for interrogation in order to deal with them.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Fujian Province Implements Opium Public Sales <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Troops Stationed in Various Prefectures Protect Opium Planting. The Military Supply Committee Publicly Levies Taxes. Fuzhou Correspondence: Local community organizations in various prefectures of Fujian Province, including Fu'ning, Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou, repeatedly opposed the stationed troops planting opium and requested the National Government to ban it last autumn, but it has not been effective. Now, the opium juice in various places will be harvested next, and donations have also begun to be collected by various armies. It is heard that an average of about 1.5 million yuan can be collected per prefecture. Moreover, after the opium juice is harvested, the various troops will manufacture and sell local opium, which can also earn a huge amount of money. Therefore, the Military Supply Committee (i.e., the organization formed by the military supply personnel of the various divisions and brigades of the National Defense Army, the Provincial Defense Army, and the Marines stationed in Fujian Province) established the so-called Prohibited Goods Inspection Office and issued prohibited goods stamps. Lin Chong and Chen Ba (both pseudonyms) were appointed as the director and deputy director of the office, and they were required to collect 150,000 yuan per month. However, after deducting 25,000 yuan for entertainment expenses, the first month was a trial period, and 50,000 yuan was paid first. The general office is located in Fuzhou, and branch offices are located in Fu'ning, Xinghua, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou. Collection offices are set up in all counties that produce opium, and the tax rate is set at 100 yuan per stamp for every package of local opium weighing seven catties. The general office in the provincial capital is located in Taijiang Pan, and preparations have been completed and will be opened next month. A police boat will be dispatched by the Water Public Security Bureau, and 12 water police and 8 inspectors will be sent. In addition, the office will specially hire two steamships for patrolling and inspecting private transportation and tax evasion. Various groups in the provincial capital are now brewing opposition, but I am afraid that it will not be very effective. (March 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e93">I Thought of "Flying Thunder" Fo. <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>I still remember that on the 18th of last month, this newspaper published that Mr. Cai Linsheng, the inventor of the Chinese Flying Thunder, had been summoned by the government to engage in manufacturing. This was indeed a surprising news, indeed a gratifying news.</p>
<p>But now it has been more than three months, I ask where is Cai Linsheng? Where is Flying Thunder? The recent losses in the Battle of Zhabei were due, on the one hand, to the thinness of the reinforcements, and the Japanese army made a desperate move and sent all their troops. On the one hand, it was because the Japanese army's planes, artillery, and equipment were sophisticated and a hundred times better than ours. It can be seen that the current war is originally a lesson in scientific warfare. You can't deceive people by blowing your own horn. I ask where is Cai Linsheng? Where is Flying Thunder?</p>
<p>Ah, Chinese people often like to deceive people, like megalomania, but the result will always be worn out. I ask such scientists to blow less of their own horn in the future, so as not to disappoint people and make people laugh.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Green Gas Levy. <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Green gas was discovered in 1774 by the Swedish Scheele: its color is yellowish-green, so in 1810, GayLussac named it Chlor from the Greek word, which means yellowish-green. Its density is about two and a half times that of air, so it is denser than air. It also has a strong pungent odor, and if we smell it too much, it will damage the lungs, and even cause death from poisoning; therefore, special attention must be paid when making green gas. Now I will describe its production method and uses.</p>
<p>But before making green gas, first write down the equipment and reagents,</p>
<p>One wine lamp; one wide-mouthed flask, one rubber stopper with two holes; one long-necked funnel; one double-curved glass tube; one small-mouthed glass bottle. A small amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid and manganese dioxide.</p>
<p>Green gas production method First insert the long-necked funnel into one hole; insert the curved glass tube into the other hole, and then place it on the table. Then take the manganese dioxide and place it in the flask, and then tighten it with a stopper. Take concentrated hydrochloric acid and pour it from the funnel, so that it immerses the manganese dioxide. What should be noted at this time is that the mouth of the tube of the long-necked funnel inside the bottle must be immersed in the hydrochloric acid, and the mouth of the curved glass tube must not be immersed in the hydrochloric acid, its mouth must be in the empty space inside the flask; the other mouth is connected to a small-mouthed bottle, which is used to store green gas. After the position of each item is properly placed; then heat under the flask with a lamp; green gas is generated in the bottle, and soon there will be yellowish-green gas in the gas storage bottle, and its color will gradually deepen, which means that the green gas in the bottle is increasing. The mouth of the storage bottle is placed upwards when it is placed, because green gas is heavier than air, so you can rest assured at the beginning that the green gas will not come out. But later, when the air in the bottle is driven away and the green gas is dense, then it will definitely want to come out from the mouth; therefore, it is best to make this production method in a ventilated place. The equation for this production method is as follows:</p>
<p>4HCL+Mn02↓CL2+MnCl2 Hydrochloric acid Manganese dioxide Green gas Manganese chloride +2H2O Water There are other more difficult production methods, which will not be repeated. Uses of green gas Raw materials used in papermaking, such as wood, bamboo heads, and the fibrous quality of rags, all use the indirect gasification of green gas to bleach it; the bleaching of cotton fibers used in dyeing also uses green gas. Other uses such as disinfection and sterilization: and toxic gas in war also has green gas, but it is cooled to below minus 34 degrees Celsius, and becomes a thick yellow-green oily liquid state, and is stored in steel cylinders.</p>
