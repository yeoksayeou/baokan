<h3 id="c1">軍縮會議説謊 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>彬</p>
<p>在遠東砲火連天戰雲濔漫的悲慘空氣中。安然集會的軍縮會議。亘半年來長時間的爭論與考慮。到最近總算已勉强告一結束。</p>
<p>檢查半年來長時間爭論的成續。就已發表的條文而觀。僅於天空轟炸。陸地軍備·化學戰爭·軍備休戰等問題。成立數項空洞無關實際之决議。此外更成立所謂道德的裁軍委員會。建議進行所謂『非戰敎育。』集全世界的政治家外交家於一堂。亘半年來之鈎心鬥角。苦慮焦思。其所得僅此數項空洞的條文。我們與其説軍縮會議只是一幕滑稽喜劇。毌寗謂其公然欺騙全世界民衆大戰的一個騙局。</p>
<p>就眞實的事實觀察。自從一九二九年十月下旬紐約華大街交易所宣告倒閉。發出經濟恐慌的信號而後。這世界即日益以加速的步武。朝着動盪的前途推進。到了去年恐慌的狂潮。洶湧澎湃已明白顯示資本主義的危機與矛盾。已達到了最高度。正惟資本主義的矛盾深刻與擴大。所以新的世界戰爭之危機。亦日益迫近眉睫。在兩種不同的意義之下。｜｜一是資本主義國家自相火併。一是資本主義與·社會主義作最後的搏戰。｜｜每一個國家都在瘋狂地積極擴大其軍備。每一個國家都在準備更兇殘的屠殺。目前世界六十個國家。用於軍備的費用共達四十一萬萬五千八百萬金元。這較之戰前已超出百分之七十。更據國際年鑑的報告。在一九三○年極端凋敝的一年中。關於軍費的用途也增加了一萬萬金元即如波蘭一小國。一九二三年軍事工業方面所僱用的僱員僅二萬一千人。到了一九三一年。也驟增至六萬五千人。這事實不是已經明白地指出了全世界正在瘋狂地準備戰爭嗎。更據不久以前。日本大阪朝日新聞載。日駐法大使芳澤返國法國兵器公司要人羅溪送行。其談話中有謂歐洲製造兵器工廠。鑒於目前遠東形勢變化。都忙於趕造武器。預備供給遠東戰爭之用。許多工廠的烟囱上。更公然高揭『爲遠東戰爭而製造』的大旗。法國秀那德兵工廠已有八億法郎的軍需品輸入日本。其他如德如美都有大批軍火向東洋輸出。各國軍械股票。都爲之騰貴。美國景氣觀測家巴蒲生。更公然宣稱。『若日本對俄宣戰。則吾人可期望世界經濟狀態之恢復。且因極東戰爭。各國所儲的殺人器具。可以暢銷各國失業者亦可大批僱入。』一切的政治家外交家以至資本家金融家。企圖以戰爭解决經濟恐慌。當然。除了戰爭以外。資本主義實在已再没有可以做的事了。</p>
<p>爲着重新分割市塲。這裏是需要戰爭。爲着爭奪煤油銅鐵以及一切的原料。這裏也需要戰爭。爲着擴大資本的剝削。爲着保障過去的投資爲着鎭壓叛亂中的殖民地。這裏都需要戰爭。一切的野心家。早已佈置好了大戰的局勢。早已安排好了屠塲。日本帝國主義者。亦早已於去年九一八發放了動手的信號。然而軍縮會議却還悠然自得地唱出『縮軍』的高調。除了成立幾個紅十字會式的决議而外。更組織所謂道德裁軍委員會看他們是怎樣地在公然説謊呵。</p>

<p>在這十七億八千四十萬八千圓歲入預算中、包含着了四億五千三百三十七萬二千圓的公積金、占全歲入四分之一强、這四億餘萬公債的募集數、實在已是一個很可驚的數目了、但全部還不僅此此、外尙有特别會計部分的七千六百十七萬九千圓公債、綜計日本本年度的公債發行額、當在五億二千九百五十五萬一千元這個公債的洪水、在最近數年來的日本財政史上、確是一件值得大書特書的材料、</p>

<p>釐拆平穩進出較繁</p>
<p>市塲交易平淡收市提早　昨日銀洋情形、交易方面、祇拆票交易比較平時略多、而洋欵交易依然與尋常相仿、未有若何繁忙、不過銀行方面買賣、以開關日比較稍多、獨以各種收解爲二日併理之、故手續上當然瑣忙、尤以外商銀行格外孔多、至於市塲集會時間以價少競爭、格外提早一刻鐘云、</p>
<p>釐價循序微跌銀拆回漲　『洋釐』早市釐價爲六錢九分一釐七毫半、較前日午市略小三毫七忽半、午市又跌一毫二忽半、爲六錢九分一厘六毫二忽半、結果兩市間計小半厘、『銀拆』早午兩市同爲一錢二分、較前日突然回昂四分、銀行掛牌五分、劃頭加水約在八九分間、銀根形勢並未見有何種升昂氣象、</p>

<p>棉紗實需益覺發展　湘粤兩帮採辦紛紛不絶、現紗被其搜罄、改購八·九·十三個月期貨、額量愈買愈巨、人心極其激昂、市盤步步向漲、查其原因、今庚長江流域一帶、因雨水調匀、年景豐收、故一般營業者多爲未雨綢缪之計、大批購辦、市面驟現蓬勃之象、本月份標紗祗有一廠交貨、所有籌碼、已被買方收去、一般散空視現銷良好、心氣更現慌亂之狀、市盤猛跳三兩三錢、但世界棉業仍在不景氣中、惟國内南方需要大旺、華廠此番底貨、業已悉數銷盡、亦係吾國紡織業之好景象也、</p>
<p>人標步漲本月期尤挺　人標前市開盤、以現紗生意暢健、長江帮亦發動採辦、致人心堅挺、塲中賣户缺乏、散空抵補、本月漲二兩、惟遠漲五六錢、二三盤聞客銷仍多、市氣更緊、又漲三六錢、結果各月漲一兩至三兩三錢、午後仍以天熱、繼續停市、標紗成交計四萬○一百五十包、查賣出義餘一千包、恊生一千包大昶四百五十包、益昶八百包、愼昌五百五十包、達記六百包、買進　大一千○五十包、長豐一千一百包、義成七百包、元泰五百五十包、恒益八百包、天隆五百五十包、茲將人標收盤價分列如下、</p>

<p>棉市堅硬、美棉形勢甚疲弱、且滙兑亦平澹、惟本棉狀况、以底貨太枯、而紗市步漲、原棉被其帶起、市上現棉、各廠需要較爲活躍、以紗銷起色、廠胃略開、至於七月份標棉、以交貨者籌碼缺乏、形勢愈挺、傳云某廠有收貨之説、遠期受其牽制也、</p>

<p>小絞米突漲三四角</p>
<p>甬帮暢辦小絞</p>
<p>津帮續裝西貢</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况大佳、因寗波帮繼續暢辦外、新有天津帮及無錫南京鎭江江北各路採辦、内地本街亦有問津、統　開二萬餘包、後市尙有繼續辦裝之意、故人心甚佳、價亦突漲三四角、小絞米高貨已開至九元六角、大市貨九元四角三分至二角七分、陳小絞大至九元二角半至二角、低次貨亦已衝出九元一關、小絞共開一萬九千包、由寗波去陳米四千及新米一千包外、其餘由各帮分去、西貢價自十元零一角大至四角、成交二千五百包、其中由天津帮去五百包外、多數爲本街收去、大絞久無開出、昨由甬帮去二千五百包價八元四角半、本街辦洋米外、又辦去溫州糙米三百包價七元七角六分、江西機元米一百零一包價十三元一角、</p>

<p>昨日起平信亦停寄　交通部於二十三日下令封鎖東北三省郵務、故本埠郵局、於二十四日起、已將寄往東北之掛號及匯兑、均告停寄、昨日起、平信等亦已一律停寄、</p>

<p>日領雖已否認</p>
<p>日僑仍在進行</p>
<p>八月　日實行</p>
<p>遠東社云、僑滬日人、因東省郵局被我封鎖後、遭受鉅大影響、曾於日前舉行會議、擬要求日領署當局設臨時郵便局、專事爲其僑民收寄東省郵件、惟昨據日領署當局表示、此事關係重大、對於僑民此項請求、未便允准、且郵務工作　繁亦非設一臨時郵便局所可濟事、故已予拒絶、惟據另一方面消息、日領署雖因碍於國際關係、表面上未便公然出此、但實際上日僑仍積極進行、聞日僑民團委員會對此問題、已有數次集議、我郵局方面以日人果有此舉、則實違反萬國郵聯規章之精神、且破壞我主權之完整、故已令上海郵務管理局嚴密調查眞相、以便呈部、轉請外交部提出抗議云、茲將種種消息彙誌如次、</p>

<p>白井康氏詢以此事之態度、據白井表示、日領署當局、初無組織郵便局之舉、蓋郵政乃國家整個主權、外人不得干涉、如果組織郵便局、則　與國際公法相抵觸、驻滬日僑、雖因中國當局實行封鎖東北郵政而感覺不便、或有此請求惟領署當局、决難照准、至日僑或有託赴遼輪隻順帶其私人郵件者、則係其個人舉動、與領署當局無涉記者又詢以自吾國實行封鎖東北郵政後、日方對之、作何感想據白井表示、此事日本政府、當然將向中國政府抗議云、</p>

<p>馬將軍誓死抗日始終如一</p>
<p>國人如未棄東北請速援助</p>
<p>黑省主席馬占山之子馬奎、吉林自衛軍總指揮丁超之子丁世强·及馬主席參謀長王鏞·前天津市市長臧啓芳等、來滬接洽後、業於前日北返、新聲社記者、曾於日前晤及馬公子等、與之暢談甚久、關於東北軍事民氣、均有極詳盡之説明、因遵囑緩兩日發表、故特於今日錄書、想關心東北情形者、當不以明日黄花目之也、</p>
<p>馬公子談　據馬公子云、家父自本年二月二十七日左右、因事出不得已、與日人敷衍、其時中心之痛苦、匪言可喻、故抵瀋以後、卽於二月二十九日、派心腹人喬裝間道入關、向北平張主任報告、因家父識字不多、且不能作書、故僅與心腹人曰、今在日人勢力下、猶關雲長之在曹營、心實在漢、待有機會、卽當復起、并請報告中央、惟尙以爲未妥、復於三月四日、派余繞道赴歐、由意大利乘輪返國、向中央</p>
<p>及北平報告、及前月返國、知家父已早歸黑省、惟家父前此之事、頗聞一般人對之發生懷疑、今事已大白、全國同胞、對之皆重釋前嫌、仍期望其爲始終抗日之一人、但余所欲爲全國同胞告者、家父此次完全爲救國下决心、誓死與日拼命、不爲勢屈、不爲利誘、縱不能滅此朝日、亦必以全力收回失地云、</p>
<p>東北軍情　又據與馬氏同來之某要人、報告東北最近狀怳云、黑省方面軍隊、現在由馬主席統率者有十餘旅、人數約計有二十五萬、騎兵亦有八萬左右、軍械頗充足、惟子彈時待接濟、此外義勇軍爲李海青統率者、約二萬餘、民團每團五六百不等、共有三十餘縣、軍械方面、小槍尙不慮缺乏、所少者重砲及高射砲、但數亦不小、日軍之爲該項義勇軍及民團所消滅者、四五百人、則時有之、惟我義勇軍之犧牲者、亦頗不少、今黑省全部面積、十分之三在日手、然皆在鐵道左右、若齊克線·呼海線·中東線·之附近、離此十里、卽不敢深入、至於吉林省正式軍隊、有丁超·李杜·兩位總數亦在十五萬左右、歷次與日軍死戰、犧牲者亦已不少、此外宫長海·馮占梅·及義勇軍王德林等、部隊亦有三萬五千餘人、散布在吉林東邊境、吉省南從敦化起、北迄松花江東北角止、全部面積、六分之五、在日人之手、祗六分之一、尙在我軍範圍内、餘如中東路西哈長線方面、小隊伍義勇軍、總數尙在六千餘、長春及哈爾濱一帶、四百五百者亦不少、祗以機會未至、彈火未充、聯絡未成、尙靜待中央命令出動、在遼寗方面、殘餘軍隊、現受日本牢籠者、遼東祇唐聚五部隊、向受于芷山指揮、但現在與各方聯絡後、亦有五六千人、雖受日人籠絡、苟中央正式有收回失地之决心、亦必能爲祖國效力也、其餘瀋地各處義勇軍、亦頗具力量、現大槪均在南滿線之東、安東之北、洮南方面·張海鵬之部隊、尙有三萬人、現雖與日人往來、决非本心、茲均在洮長線附近、遼西方面、若營溝帮子錦縣一帶、亦有十餘萬人、現在皆一千二千散處各方、惜乎缺乞統帥、惟仍在與日對持中、該項軍隊、未敢入城市、但日軍亦不敢正視、遼南方面、民團最多、有大部份者約二萬人、其餘大縣及幾十村落、聯絡一起、其勢亦不可侮、且彈藥充足、竭力與日軍奮鬭、以上所述、不過一種大槪狀况、而國人現在所亟應注意、苟認東北三省、仍爲中華民國之整個問題者、當迅速起而援助、否則以日人之處心積慮、必有進一步之侵略手段、今彼所畏者、我義勇軍耳、故最近已開始將其在鄉軍人移殖東北、此爲準備消滅我義勇軍之第一步也、苟不急救、則不堪回首矣、</p>
<p>民氣一般　繼謂、此次東北事變若在三十年前、則東北三省、早淪日手、絶無奮鬥之餘地、蓋三十年前之東北民衆、智識尙無今日之發展、對於國家觀念、至爲膚淺、現在東北民衆、智識進步甚速、愛國愛族之氣、至爲熱烈憤慨、如事變以來、熱河方面、每日有三四人往來聯絡者、不祇一個團體、甚至有時傳中央已派大軍抗日者、或北平大軍已出動者、此雖近於謠傳、但其不忘祖國、及亟盼中央援救之心理、可見一斑、再舉一例作證、卽在僞國成立時、瀋陽哈爾濱一帶、到處皆須慶賀、凡科員以上、皆須叩跪、慶賀人各執一燈、但未到瀋陽慶賀、其燈皆自動燬滅、蓋出於逼迫、皆非自願、卽跪叩時、除台上幾人外、餘亦一無跪者、此外是日沿途所貼慶賀標語甚多、但越宿則盡爲小孩扯去、小孩尙如此、餘可想見、總計三省民氣、祇南滿附近、較爲相差、原因係南滿久處於日人勢力範圍中、遂致習焉而不察、但亦祗少數、非盡是如此、故敢説東北三省民衆、現在表面上雖未有不與日人週旋者、亦祇虚與委蛇而已、苟一旦關内有整個辦法、關外各處、立刻皆成武裝同志、故將來收回失地、此一般民氣、定能予以一種極大力量、且軍事上之勝敗、不一定在器利彈足、古來以少勝多者、亦屬屢見不鮮、更以熙洽軍隊而論、其士兵現在亦因處於日軍勢力之下、所以未敢動作、如眞有相當辦法、立刻可以反正、卽以前次煕洽在哈長綫作戰爲例、與丁杜兩部隊上接觸、卽大呼中國人如何可與自已人戰爭、呼完之後、紛紛四散、有反正者、有散去者、卽前次馬將軍江橋一役、亦是如此、苟非這些軍隊反正、日軍亦不致慘敗到如此之速、雖終於彈盡援絶、而退守海倫、但此雖士兵之動作、亦卽民氣之表現、故實際上眞心服從僞國者、極爲少數、有之、皆前與張漢卿有𨻶者、否則僞國亦决不能成立、現�</p>
<p>在東三省智識階級之青年、皆已紛紛回平津、無智識者、可走者皆已走、餘皆投入義勇軍、故現在苟有辦法、卽三省之大學生、亦可立卽號召三千人（曾在軍旅中受過軍事智識者、亦有一萬八千人、此種人之留在東北、因政治無辦法、莫不在忍受苦悶憤慨之生活、倘中央一旦有辦法、實係最好之民衆前鋒、惟若政府此後永久觀望、仍不確切採實行武力收回辦法、則此班青年定將發生極重大之慘案、相信較之朝鮮民衆之炸彈、更要利害十倍、蓋其决不甘心屈服於日帝國主義鐵蹄下也、尤希望上海民衆、勿以滬戰恊定、槍砲聲已遠離耳鼓、遂置東北三千萬同胞在水深火熱於不顧、無論金錢槍彈、倘能源源接濟、以東北民氣旺盛、堅苦奮鬥、必不致使白山黑水、永淪於木屐之下也云云</p>

<p>今日運往華北銷售</p>
<p>日貨報關行大活動</p>
<p>九一八事變發生　國人同起抵制日貨、及本年一二八、市政府對日屈服、而日軍當晚即進攻閘北、引起戰事、在華日貨、均皆停止貿易、及日兵撤退、日商急謀恢復對華商務、惟内地抵制風潮甚烈、近兩月來日貨進口、已十分擁擠、除一部分運出至各地外、餘均存在貨棧中、日來滬上日僑對於我國抵制日貨急謀消滅、今日且開始有大宗東洋貨、裝往華北各埠、茲將此事詳情、查報如下、</p>
<p>停止排貨交涉　上海日本居留民、因長江南北洋各地之日商、在戰時退出者、今皆復往恢復戰前貿易、惟以内地排貨、深入人心、致日貨無法暢運銷售、上海各棧存儲之日貨、多至數萬噸、現擬設法載出、乃特開大會决定要求滬上日領、向我市政府交涉、要求我方履行一月二十八日經吳市長與日領等議定之禁止華人抵制日貨、並停止各地之排貨運動、要求我國官廳以命令取締、否則日方將進一步爲有效的强迫執行、</p>
<p>各棧日貨山積　自日郵社將中日四航路復班後、日貨進口、又風起雲湧、疋頭·啤酒·洋紙·藥品·皮革·玩具·等等、運來至多、上次六甲丸輪進口、運到日貨一萬六千餘件、昨日生駒丸輪至滬、又到九千七百餘件、致三菱·滙山·各碼頭貨棧中、日貨堆積如山、尙有大批東貨、正在絡續裝來滬、</p>
<p>今日大批出口　華北方面、日貨去路最旺、近自大連海關封鎖事發生、我國對於轉運到東北各地貨物、在上海進口者、統須徵收進口税、而日方誣指我課二重關税、在滬之大批日本貨、轉往華北者、日商積極趕裝、昨日日清之華山丸輪、特由浦東移到三菱碼頭、便利裝運巨額日貨下船、總數有數千噸、華山丸係裝足滿儎、此爲公開運載日本大宗貨出口之第一船、亦卽九一八後之最多的一批也、</p>
<p>長江日船復業　長江去之日本貨物、自上年九月以後、東洋卽無裝運來滬輪船、直至本月二十二日、始有運到、已經十個月未曾進口之日本海帶、刻亦開始載到、長江日本貨、第一批到七百餘件、已卸在滙山·三菱·兩碼頭、茲定二十八日由日清輪裝赴漢口各地、長江日輪亦于是日起作爲正式的復業、公開的攬運日貨、滬上奸商王某·李某·等所組之日貨報關行自昨日起、已大爲活動、紛紛代報代裝日本貨物矣、</p>

<p>輪船遵章掛旗</p>
<p>醫生到船遲誤</p>
<p>喚警禁卸來貨</p>
<p>幸經調解了結</p>
<p>海港檢疫處、近日對於進口商輪騐疫、十分重視、凡進口船不得擅自駛進浦江、須待醫生騐過旅客後、方准進口、各船到滬、日間懸掛黄旗、夜間則掛三色紅燈、昨日招商局新豐輪進口、與海港檢疫處發生衝突、新豐且被禁止卸貨、至午後始經雙方議商解决、茲將此事經過、分誌如下</p>
<p>進口懸旗　招商新豐輪、自天津開滬、途中接總局電報、令船到吳淞、所搭乘客、須經海港檢疫處騐疫、日間船上命懸黄方旗、檢疫醫生、自可到來、昨晨新豐抵吳淞、遵照新章、將黄旗高掛、船開慢車、詎意駛入淞口、始終不見有醫生到船騐疫、嗣聞淞口騐疫船前被日軍毁去、近改在楊樹浦江面檢騐、新豐乃駛抵楊樹浦、仍不見有醫生到來、不得已緩航至金利源碼頭、八時四十分靠船、至九時猶不見醫生到來、旅客已在輪大閙矣、</p>
<p>客去醫來　新豐由津來滬之乘客、共二百數十人、及船抵碼頭、各客爭相上陸、船員阻擋不住、祗得聽憑各客離舟他去、至九時三十分、全船乘客、業已悉數上陸、船内不留一人、此時海港騐疫處之醫官、方施施而來、到船不見一客、即向船員辦交涉、先由大副姜長慶向醫生言、新豐自淞即懸黄旗、沿江進口、未見醫生來騐、是尊處自棄職責、並非輪船規避、迨輪到客走、船員無法阻止、其咎不在輪方也、</p>
<p>禁止起貨　該醫生聞姜言大怒、絶不認誤時曠職、即至船主間、向新豐船主西人克勞夫交涉、指新豐輪爲違背海港騐疫章程、便强令船上司機人將水警旗掛起、召喚水巡捕到來、大副姜長慶以此舉關係重大、上前阻止時、而船主克勞夫轉責令司機將水警旗速扯起、姜立即到局報告、霎時水上警察、應召到船、疑輪中有發生大變事也、全武裝水警到船後、當由海港處醫生、令各該水警將新豐輪看守、不許船上起卸來貨、因此發生重大交涉、</p>
<p>調解經過　海港處醫生、禁阻新豐卸貨、碼頭工人與提貨之客家、一時頓起恐慌、爭到局中探詢、同時海港檢疫處、亦派醫官陳永漢到招商局、見船務課主任王統交涉、當由王科長向陳説明新豐初無抗違騐疫之意、『懸旗後醫生不到』、輪船亦無辦法、不能强旅客留船、下午後、由王統親赴海港檢疫處、面見伍連德、述明誤會、並請撤去水警、以便新豐卸貨、直至午後、此事始經解决、新豐來貨、方得啓艙出卸、然已阻誤半日、而引起碼頭工人與貨客等重大之疑慮也、</p>

<p>商界聞人葉惠鈞先生。忠勇梗直。於辛亥光復上海之役。厥功甚偉。蓋使當時非藉商團之力。一舉而定滬市。則金陵不能速克。而清廷援師。且自江浦長驅而下。事態危殆。勢且無幸。一簧之虧。實繋於是。先生誠有功於民國哉。</p>
<p>迨後項城稱帝。慮先生爲肘腋患。懸賞購捕。於是先生亡命扶桑。艱苦備嘗。回國後。乃並不以此自儕於革命先進之列。專心商業。絶意仕路。而義之所在。輙赴之若渴。於地方公益。勞怨弗辭。今雖年届古稀。猶服務社會無倦容。乃惡耗傳來。先生遽以腹瘤症不起。遺型安仰。緬想徒勞。實令人不勝痛悼者也。</p>
<p>先生賦性肫摯。待人處事。一本至誠。然持論嚴正。人有不當理。輙面斥其非。雖稠人廣座。不顧也。忠言逆耳。人或以此忌之。然於先生旣卒之翌日。即向之以事銜恨先生者。亦多來送殮。甚有慟哭失聲者。先生之感人也深矣。</p>
<p>先生爲遺腹生。家貧無以求學。年十四。即來滬習米業。恪恭𠕏懈。精勤所事。業餘則刻苦研讀。至今年登耄耋。猶每晨習字讀書不少輟。至操守廉潔。不妄取一介。則滬人士咸能道之。嘗憶有某耍津。遣人齎厚禮至。先生堅不納。而臧獲必欲先生受。至反唇相稽。先生輙奮臂繋之户外。聞者咸引爲美談。</p>
<p>聞先生之病腹瘤也。也淹纏至三閲月。先是。政府召集國難會議於洛陽。先生亦被聘爲會員。時已抱病多日。家人環阻之。弗聽。旣力疾進京。遂委頓於逆旅。於是折回滬上。則已病入膏肓矣。即詣廣慈。</p>
<p>醫院求治。院長法人。素精刀圭。謂有新發明之雷錠療法者。足以起先生疾。而索酬至二千金。先生殊無以應。且以診費若是其昂。不願受治。其哲嗣等多方奔走。復倉猝未能足數。重以先生堅主離院。遂未及治而返。嗣後迭經中外醫師診治。卒不得瘳。</p>
<p>當先生淹臥床第時。間或神志不清。而所語亦多社會公益事。一日。王曉籟君往訪。先生適若明若昧。忽與談本市市政諸問題。滔滔不絶。王君惟唯唯應之。</p>
<p>綜先生一生。盡瘁於地方。去歲。於滬城購置房産數椽。蓋已盡傾先生七十年來勤儉之所貯矣。而造價尙不敷數千元。經其哲嗣等籌措而償。滿擬白髮高年。稍享晚晴之福。而昊天不吊。據終天年。國家社會。均失柱石。爲之痛悼無已。</p>

<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>碱係洗滌油垢要品。我國舊時所用之土碱。産自山東等地。自洋碱進口。土碱漸爲國人擯棄。厥後。上海國人設立之製碱工廠漸多。於是外國祗來製碱用之碱粉。塊碱亦不再進口矣。迄今上海製碱工廠。計八家。大者如亨利。在小九華街。立大在浦東張家浜。永茂祥在南市裏馬路泰康在唐山路等。</p>
<p>買碱以方計。每方重一百三十斤左右。市價洋五元以上。上海全市。年銷貨品。約値洋四十萬元。</p>
<p>碱粉大都售自上海英商卜内門洋行。國人自製者。天津有永利公司。現由上海白克路久大精	鹽公司經理。每担市價銀七兩幾錢、外貨價格亦彷彿、據業中人談。兩貨相比。國貨實較勝外貨。蓋碱粉一項。有如水泥。設經風受濕。卽失效用。卜内門粉運自外洋。裝運一不經心。往往减去漲力。國貨取料較便。不虞受濕等事發生。其製造</p>
<p>其製造係用手工。每碱粉百斤。攙潔面粉（卽小蘇打）三十斤。用水調之。待調和。傾於巨鐵皮做就之方形框中。框須可分析者。不然。凝結後不易出框。潔面粉。市價每担銀十一兩左右。外貨出。</p>
<p>㈩㈧　洋燭工廠</p>
<p>洋燭原料。止白蠟（卽火油中提出者）一種。入釜化至相當程度。傾入鐵皮模型中。型中預置燭芯。待凝結。卽成洋燭。用大型者。一次可出洋燭八十支。小者四十支而已。燭芯製造者。上海有三友·三星·兩廠最著名。每包二千尺。價洋一元左右。至白蠟一項。係上海外商亞細亞公司獨家經理。市價每担洋二十餘元。</p>
<p>洋燭　批以箱計。每六支爲一筒。重量不一.以十二兩者爲通用。每箱裝二十五筒。照十二兩重者。每箱市價洋四元左右。上海洋燭廠。以小九華街亨利。垃坡橋南洋·賴義碼頭華利等廠較大。去年銷售洋燭。各計在七八萬箱左右。其他若裏馬路之南恊興·恒興裕。新閘路之濂泰新。（卽五洲燭廠）浦東之立大。虹口之勤昌。董家渡之餘慶豐等。亦皆著名者也。合計上海全市洋燭　工廠。有九家。而英商白禮氏洋燭。銷行我國。與年俱增。年計營業三四百萬元至足驚人也。</p>

<p>：『是要緊的事，你必得天天通大便。大便一天不通，晚上就得做惡夢，人也覺得不舒服。出恭是很要緊的一件事。』大家都笑了。朱先生繼續説：『我們把一天之内，吃飯，讀書，寫字，掃地，燒飯，打拳，睡覺，玩，撒尿，出恭這些事都寫出來，並且什麽時候做什麽事，什麽事做多少鐘點或做多少分量便成了一天的計畫。秋兒｜你定出你的一天計畫給我聽聽。』秋兒説：『吃飯三餐，每餐兩大碗，種　半點鐘，做木工一點鐘，國語一點鐘，算學一點鐘，寫字半點鐘，玩科學把戲一點鐘，家裏掃地半點鐘，打拳一點鐘，睡覺十點鐘，玩兩點鐘，出恭一次，撒尿不一定。』朱先生説：『這就是秋兒的一天的計畫。他雖然遺漏了好些事但的確是一個計畫。計畫就是把我們所要做的事，開起一個單子，使我們時常看見，不致做了這樣，忘了那樣。我們主張過什麽生活就是受什麽敎育：過有計畫的生活就算是受有計畫的敎育：過没有計畫的生活就算是受没有計畫的敎育。説到計畫：有一天的計畫，有一個月的計畫，有一年的計畫，有三年的計畫，有十年的計畫，有終身的計畫，我們小朋友在今年這一年當中應當做些什麽事，每件事應當做多少，都要計畫出來，纔不致手忙脚亂。好，我們來定一個古廟兒童的一年計畫吧。』</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨日本刊中有『可憐的阿Ｋ』一文，其中事實，是一個未成年的小大姐，被小東家誘惑成姦，後被太太知悉，立將小大姐開除，並駡她是爛汚貨，小大姐只得含羞飲泣而去，這種事實，在貴族式的家庭裏，原是數見不鮮的事，這原是抽象的説法。</p>
<p>但這種事實，在情理上説來，可算是不平已極，一個清清白白的小大姐，明明被她兒子誘引成姦，非但不使成爲眷屬，或賠償她的相當損失，還要開除其差使，駡她爛汚貨，而在小大姐方面，一若自已不應該去仰攀小東家，實是賤人的罪大惡極，應該去認錯，這種被壓迫的心理，與資本家的酷辣手段，往往如此。</p>
<p>至婚姻制度，在法律上雖無階級規定，然而在一般腐敗的心理上，其無形的階級，比較法律規定還嚴，做官人家，一定要配做官人家，有錢人家，一定要攀有錢人家，方得謂之『門當户對』，否則不是笑富貴人家有失身分，便是笑貧賤人家發醜高攀。</p>
<p>在民國時代，人民原是一律平等的，所謂貧與富，不過有錢與無錢之分，賤與貴，不過幸運與不幸運之分，此外尙有什麽分别，至於圓顱方趾，耳目口鼻，及其他一切的一切，原是相同，何以小大姐一定配不上小東家，小東家一定不配娶小大姐呢？</p>
<p>我再進一步説，富的人家，一定要去配貧的人家，貴的人家，一定要攀賤的人家，如是非但富貴貧賤，得以均匀，在貧賤者必定感激不遑，若自已富貴，而又配富貴，是爲畫蛇添足，自已貧賤，而又娶貧賤，原爲雪上加霜，這原是我國的惡習慣，若不先把這種惡習打破，社會的階級制度，永無剷除之日呢！</p>

<p>— 譚冠翰</p>
<p>暑熱的开氣，最易給人們治製汗液，如果不勤於清潔，肌膚内泄排出來的汗液，黏染於衣料之上，便蒸發一種異臭，這種臭劑，誰也不會歡迎，即使自已，也覺難受，其次，衣服御在體上，自不能用特别的精神去護衛，在宴席間，在書案旁，或者遇到天雨，在泥濘的道路上，以及······等處偶不留心，少不得被沾了些茶汁，肉汁，墨水，顔料，泥漿；油漆和其他意外的不雅觀的汚點，那時，豈不深感到不愉快嗎？所以，清潔衣服的方法，大槪是閲者們所樂聞的了。</p>
<p>在尋常，衣服的洗滌劑，大都不外是用肥皂，因爲肥皂的原料，是脂肪和納等物所製成，它遇到了水時，便發出脂肪酸的酸性鹽及鹻質，酸性鹽是一種滑膩性的原體，能夠帮助洗滌，鹻質是一種游離性的原體，可以將吻於衣服上的汚垢分離，而溶解於水中。</p>
<p>然而，雖則肥皂是最好的洗滌劑，但用時却不能不注意幾點，（一）普通市售的肥皂，向有廉貴之别，可是，兩倍價廉的肥皂，敵不得半塊價貴肥皂的功效，它們優劣的辨别，祗有硬性和軟性兩類，前者是優種，後者是劣質，（二）用肥皂洗衣服，看起來似是十分簡單，其實，洗滌時和水也很有關係，用冷水不如用熱水，因爲熱水的洗滌作用，比較冷水强得多，可以使皂液浸入衣料的織維中間，而致汚垢易於除掉，（三）在内地｜｜没有自來水的地方，便要認明水的軟硬性的不同，雨水，河水和湖水，是屬於軟性的，泉水，海水和井水，是屬於硬性的，肥皂的洗滌劑，最合於軟性的水，否則會化生一種中性納鹽，或鉀鹽和脂肪酸的鈣鹽，這些都是能减少洗滌的功效。</p>
<p>用久的衣服，往往使它不能再次潔白如新，於是便不得不施行漂白的方法了，漂白劑有三種，如漂白粉，硫氱氣白和過氱化氫，但通常都用漂白粉，用時先將被漂的物質在冷水中浸着，然後用漂白粉一匙，注入半面盆的清水内，拌調使匀，然後取其澄清的漂白液，傾於盛衣的盆内，再將衣服浸染一過，一小時後，取出絞乾，又浸於稀鹽酸裏，約半小時，再出絞乾，浸於次亞硫酸納裏，約十分鐘，取出用清水盡量冲洗，乾後便返舊還新了，（關於漂白粉的製法，有暇時當再另文叙述，但藥房亦有買，購用甚易。）</p>

<p>— 蕭亢石</p>
<p>婚嫁：是誰都不可免的事，而且是人生最大問題的一個，無非在謀幸福而已｜可是我國的習俗，非常浮套，而近來的世風，變本加奢，照現在婚嫁的耗費而論，窮的非千金不可，至於富的呢｜數千金數萬金不等。牠們的心理都抱着虚榮心和好勝心，以塲面闊綽炫其榮耀，却不去考察是否能夠達到眞正的幸福，所以富者創在前，貧者隨其後，失掉了婚嫁是謀幸福的眞義，反而受到無窮的後患｜</p>
<p>我們見到社會上窮人的婚嫁，爲着奢侈潮流所趨化，不得不飲鳩止渴，偕貨也，負債也，破産也，經濟壓迫而致自殺也，無所不至其極。唉｜此種惡俗，在今日國凋民敝之下，勢所不可再長，且應速謀急切的改革，茲將管見所及者三端，臚陳於下。</p>
<p>（一）應革除妝奩　我國婚嫁的習俗，最重視妝奩，無非冀親友的贊譽，卜隣里的稱頌，一些都没有意義。而賞給搬　工人的無謂喜封，也所費不贊。所以鄙意把妝奩革除，應用傢具，由男方自置，可以省掉爭執妝奩厚薄的口舌，也可省掉許多無謂的金錢。</p>
<p>（一）應革除報復式的賀禮和喜酒，親友間有婚嫁的事，當然：互相以銀錢或禮物慶賀，而主人却大張筵席，這種報復式的應酬，有什麽意義呢？在慶賀的出了一些賀禮，換到了一杯喜酒，在主人受到了一些禮物，請慶賀的吃喜酒。｜禮物和喜酒｜都是化費掉，没有實惠。所以鄙意把牠革除，在結婚日備了一些茶點，答謝觀禮的親友們，那麽：兩方面都不破鈔了。</p>
<p>（一）應節約簡單　照今日生活程度而論，婚嫁的一切費用和儀式，都應節約簡單，把耗費的，浮套的，都應澈底革除，向實際上求幸福。</p>
<p>上面的三端：是否有當？還要請高明的討論一下：可是：世俗是牢不破的，我們窮措大高唱着，假使没有大人先生們來提倡，有什麽效力呢｜然而：骨鯁在喉，不得不吐啊！</p>

<p>前日本刊主編者有改良社會討論會的提倡，這誠然是適合於現代社會的需要，而爲報紙的一件重大使命。</p>
<p>可是改良這兩個字：從好底方面説起來，當然是將那畸形的社會，不完美的社會，都要矯正牠的弊害，歸納到善良的軌道上去。可是從含混的方面説：犯罪的改良，非法的改良，也是呌做改良，這樣的改良，名目雖仍是改良，實則就將那善意的良能改掉了去。</p>
<p>現在姑舉幾個例來説説：（一）滬上有幾家報紙，也在高唱着改良社會，其中有提倡改良婦女時髦裝束的，這種能夠養成女子奢侈的心理和陋習，因此而發生的道德墮落，經濟壓迫，家庭變故等等流弊，也就不可勝言。又有提倡改良捲烟的，捲烟在工業立塲上，尙可説有興利除弊的必要：但爲吸衆着想，則防碍發育，傷害腦筋，虚耗金錢，是否需要改良？（二）各國殺人的利器，現下都在積極的研究改良，這種改良，是含有什麽意思？日本對滿洲潙國，也在積極的研究改良，這種改充，又含有什麽意思？（三）戲台上有一種流行戲名子呌做改良新殺子報，殺子而欲改良，這眞是破天荒的改良。推而至於時下的社會，姦淫盜殺的案件，日新月異，又何嘗不可説是改良？就連最近那犬與人交的非人道主義，也是那陳新　改良出來的呵！</p>
<p>所以凡是有人要討論改良社會，須要盡力從善的方面立脚，當你想出一個新的問題，擬出一個新的方法，都要能夠關於社會，家庭，個人，有實在的利益，然後才能呌做改良，然後才不負本刊主編者設會的苦心，然後才能使苦悶而無出路的人羣多少得點福利。</p>
<p>我們試就已過去的本刊立論：他是提倡科學，改良工藝，以謀生産落後的實業普及。揭穿黑幕，懲警人羣，以求罪惡社會的根本推翻。研究社會集團家庭制度種種進化，以　適當潮流的應時産生　　　　　使命。是如何的偉大，這種改良，是如何的美善，這正是編者給予讀者討論會的　種暗示，這也是討論會讀者　條光明的途徑。不過舉一反三，那就在讀者的努力了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Lying About the Disarmament Conference <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Bin</p>
<p>In the tragic atmosphere of the Far East, with the sounds of gunfire and the miasma of war clouds, the Disarmament Conference serenely convened. After half a year of lengthy debates and considerations, it has finally come to a grudging end.</p>
<p>Examining the achievements of half a year of lengthy debates, based on the published articles, only on issues such as aerial bombing, land armaments, chemical warfare, and arms embargoes, several empty and impractical resolutions have been established. Furthermore, a so-called moral disarmament committee has been established, proposing so-called "anti-war education." Gathering politicians and diplomats from around the world in one place, engaging in power struggles for half a year, and racking their brains, all that has been achieved are these few empty articles. Rather than saying that the Disarmament Conference is just a farce, it is more accurate to call it a blatant deception of the world's public, a great war hoax.</p>
<p>Observing the true facts, since the New York Wall Street Stock Exchange declared its collapse in late October 1929, sending out signals of economic panic, the world has increasingly moved towards a turbulent future with accelerated steps. By last year, the surging tide of panic clearly demonstrated that the crisis and contradictions of capitalism had reached their highest point. Precisely because the contradictions of capitalism are profound and expanding, the crisis of a new world war is also increasingly imminent. Under two different meanings, || one is capitalist countries fighting each other, and the other is capitalism and socialism engaging in a final battle || every country is frantically and actively expanding its armaments. Every country is preparing for more brutal massacres. Currently, the world's sixty countries spend a total of 41.58 billion gold dollars on armaments. This is 70% more than before the war. According to the International Yearbook, in the extremely desolate year of 1930, the use of military spending also increased by 100 million gold dollars. For example, in Poland, a small country, the number of employees employed in the military industry in 1923 was only 21,000. By 1931, it had also increased sharply to 65,000. Doesn't this fact clearly indicate that the whole world is frantically preparing for war? Furthermore, according to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun of Japan not long ago, when Japanese Ambassador to France Yoshizawa returned home, Roche, a key figure in a French arms company, saw him off. In their conversation, it was mentioned that European arms manufacturing factories, in view of the current changes in the Far East situation, are busy rushing to manufacture weapons, preparing to supply them for the Far East war. On the chimneys of many factories, the banner "Manufacturing for the Far East War" is openly displayed. The French Schneider arms factory has already imported 800 million francs worth of military supplies into Japan. Other countries such as Germany and the United States are exporting large quantities of munitions to the East. The stocks of various countries' armaments have all become expensive. American economic forecaster Babson publicly declared, "If Japan declares war on Russia, we can expect the recovery of the world's economic situation. Moreover, due to the Far Eastern war, the killing tools stored in various countries can be sold smoothly, and a large number of unemployed people in various countries can also be hired." All the politicians, diplomats, capitalists, and financiers are trying to solve the economic panic through war. Of course, besides war, capitalism really has nothing else to do.</p>
<p>In order to re-divide the market, war is needed here. In order to compete for oil, copper, iron, and all raw materials, war is also needed here. In order to expand the exploitation of capital, in order to protect past investments, and in order to suppress rebellious colonies, war is needed here. All the ambitious people have already arranged the situation for a great war. The slaughterhouse has already been arranged. The Japanese imperialists also issued the signal to start on September 18th last year. However, the Disarmament Conference is still leisurely singing the high tune of "disarmament." Besides establishing a few Red Cross-style resolutions, they also organized a so-called Moral Disarmament Committee. Look at how they are blatantly lying.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops Continue to Increase Troops on the Border of Rehe <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Fly to the Skies Over Chengde for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>Rehe Authorities Apologize to Japan Saying It is Inaccurate</p>
<p>Central Figures Plan to Meet Again at Guling</p>
<p>(Beiping) News from Rehe is silent, telephone and telegraph lines have not yet been repaired, Tang dispatched Transportation Captain Tan to Beiping, to report to the authorities, the Japanese army continues to increase troops to the border of Rehe (Special Telegram on the 24th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Rehe is peaceful, but Japan's plan to seize Rehe is still urgent, making military preparations in Jinzhou, its plan is to focus on Chaoyang, Jianchang, Chifeng in the first step, taking a large encirclement of Rehe, and bombing various important passes with aircraft, Japanese troops in Baiqibao, Goubangzi and other places have been ordered to gather in Jinzhou, Suizhong (Special Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telegram from Chengde, at noon on the 23rd, Japanese aircraft flew from the west to Lingyuan and other counties and distributed leaflets. It is not known whether they could reach Rehe. At 1 p.m. that afternoon, two Japanese reconnaissance planes flew from the southeast to the skies above the provincial capital for about 20 minutes, scattering many Liaoxi briefings, before flying northwest. (Special Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) External news, the Tokyo telegram carried by the Japanese League said that the Rehe authorities had apologized to Japan for the Chaoyang incident and accepted all the demands of the Japanese side, etc., which is absolutely inaccurate. The Japanese army took the Ishimoto incident as an excuse to launch an invasion of Rehe, entirely to test the international atmosphere and whether the Rehe authorities were prepared. Who would have thought that as soon as the news came out, the world was astonished, and Tang Yulin was determined to coexist with the province. The Japanese army was concerned about the environment, so it changed its plan, on the one hand adopting inflammatory tactics to disrupt public security, and on the other hand inciting puppet organizations to send troops as pioneers, hoping to avoid international criticism, in order to achieve its clever seizure plan. At the moment, the area near Chaoyang has not yet escaped the state of disturbance. The Rehe authorities are determined to resist to the end in accordance with the guidelines of the central government. Central figures, in order to negotiate major plans for resisting insults and suppressing bandits, plan to meet again in Guling. It is heard that Chiang has arrived in Guling, and President Wang and the three ministers Song, Luo, and Chen will go together in the coming days. Song has scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Beijing on the 26th. Jiang, believing that foreign insults and internal worries are pressing, telegraphed Chen Mingshu to postpone going abroad, and sent a representative with a personal letter from Jiang to Beijing and then to Shanghai, earnestly requesting him to stay. (Special Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shuren talked about how overseas Chinese, upon hearing of the Japanese army's invasion of Rehe, were extremely indignant and repeatedly telegraphed Zhang Xueliang, requesting active resistance, and were willing to provide material and spiritual assistance as much as possible, and planned to form volunteer troops to return to the country and join the army as pioneers in killing the enemy. (Special Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) British and American sources have obtained accurate information about Rehe, and the situation in Rehe has eased. The reason is not that Tang Yulin has succumbed, nor that Japan has suspended military operations. Originally, the Mianchao branch line belonged to the Beining line. Japan occupied the Fengshan section outside the customs and wanted to control the Jinchao branch line within the Fengshan line as well. Therefore, taking advantage of the kidnapping of Ishimoto, it sent troops to Chaoyang. After the Rehe army resisted, they bombed Chaoyi. Subsequently, Tang Yulin withdrew the resisting army to Jianping Lingyuan, and the Japanese army was ordered to stop in Yizhou. A small number of police officers went to Chaoyang Station, willing to cooperate with the Rehe officials to jointly investigate the whereabouts of Ishimoto. Tang Yulin's subordinate Commander Qi is willing to assist and requested the Japanese army not to advance. The current situation is that both sides maintain the original state.

<h3 id="e3">Ministry of Transportation <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Declaration of Blocking Postal Services in the Northeast</p>
<p>Japan Instigates Rebels to Seize Postal Rights</p>
<p>Administrative Destruction Prevents Business from Being Executed</p>
<p>Counterfeit Stamps Used Should All Be Treated as Insufficient Postage</p>
<p>All Responsibilities Should Be Borne by the Japanese Government</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Because Japan instigated rebels to seize postal rights in the Northeast, the Ministry of Transportation was forced to take decisive measures, suspending postal services in the Northeast, and issued a declaration on the 23rd. The following is the full text of the declaration:</p>
<p>The postal service in the two postal districts of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang in our three northeastern provinces is located in the most convenient land transportation route between Europe and Asia. Therefore, it is not only the most important postal district in China but also a major transshipment point for mail transportation between Europe and Asia. The annual profit of the postal business in these three provinces is more than two or three million yuan, which is enough to nourish the poor postal districts within the customs. The amount of money remitted from the post offices in these three provinces to the customs reaches as much as 21 to 22 million yuan each year. Therefore, in terms of its own economic relationship, it is no exaggeration to say that the postal service in these three provinces is the lifeline of the entire Chinese postal service. The Japanese government is well aware of the importance of the postal service in these three provinces in China and world transportation, and it has been coveting the postal rights in these three provinces for more than a day. The foreign post offices in South Manchuria should have been abolished long ago according to the Sino-Japanese Treaty, but they have not yet been fulfilled, which is a clear proof of their premeditation. After the September 18th Incident, the violent Japanese army detained our mail, harassed our post offices, insulted our postal workers, and hindered our mail transportation, gradually exposing its conspiracy to plunder. In March of this year, the puppet organization created by them, the so-called "Manchukuo," appeared, and it became even more reckless, using this tool to realize its plunder. The chief postal officers of the two districts were constantly threatened, and the postal administration was constantly interfered with. Some of their staff members were brutally killed by the Japanese army, and there were many cases of arrests or torture. Other illegal oppressions are too numerous to mention. The Ministry, considering the close relationship between the postal service in these two districts and world transportation, and for the convenience of communication between Chinese and foreign people, has tried its best to tolerate it for several months. Unexpectedly, the puppet government took an inch and wanted a mile, actively forcing and pressing. Recently, it has detained postal funds, ordered most of them to be puppet postal officials of Japanese nationality, forcibly occupied the houses and properties of the post offices in the two districts, and forced the use of its issued counterfeit stamps. The postal administration in the two districts has been completely destroyed by this, and all business cannot be executed as a result. Under these circumstances, the Ministry believes that our country's patience has exceeded its due limit. It has now ordered the temporary suspension of all postal services in the two districts. During the suspension period, all mail sent to Europe or the Americas will no longer be sent via Siberia but will be delivered via the Suez Canal or the Pacific Ocean. The post offices of all member countries of the Postal Union will also do the same for mail coming to and from China and various countries. Stamps issued in the three northeastern provinces that have not been approved by the General Post Office of China will never be recognized. All letters and parcels affixed with these counterfeit stamps will be treated as insufficient postage. All responsibility for the impact on public transportation caused by this forced blockade shall be borne by the Japanese government. July 23, the 21st year of the Republic of China, concurrently Minister of Transportation, Huang Shaoxiong. (Central News Agency Telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>Telegram to the International Postal Bureau</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The General Post Office of China sent a telegram in French to the International Postal Bureau in Switzerland on the 25th. The translated text is as follows: The Japanese government instigated the government of its puppet country to dispatch postal personnel, most of whom are Japanese, to forcibly seize the local postal agencies in the three eastern provinces and their properties, and forced the postal agencies to use the new stamps of its puppet country, destroying the unity of the Chinese postal service and causing the postal agencies to be unable to perform their duties. In view of this special and extraordinary situation, the General Post Office of China has no choice but to request your office to inform the International Postal Union that, in accordance with Article 27 of the London International Postal Convention, all postal services in the three eastern provinces will be temporarily suspended until a new method is determined. From now on, various mails sent to Europe and the United States will not pass through the Siberian Railway, but will be sent via the Suez Canal or the Pacific Ocean. Please also ask the International Postal Union to send all mails sent to China or passing through China according to this method.

There is no better way to survive than to fight the enemy. However, there is no hope of survival. For the country and the people, no sacrifice is too great. Shanxi Province is in financial difficulty, and Yan has decided to reduce the military pay by another 60,000 yuan for each army. The cavalry and artillery have begun to eliminate the weak and retain the strong, and the infantry is also in the planning stage. After this reduction, there is still a monthly shortage of more than 200,000 yuan in military pay. The Shanxi banknotes are only exchanged for 3 million yuan, and the remaining 57 million yuan are consumed at a discount, resulting in an invisible loss for the people. The land reclamation bank founded by Yan has been registered by the Ministry of Industry, and from now on, merchants who have experience and guarantees in running industries can obtain capital at low interest rates.

<p>Instigated by the Japanese to Disturb Siberia</p>
<p>Important Russian Officials Leaving Harbin One After Another</p>
<p>Sino-Russian Situation Gradually Tense</p>
<p>The Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun reported that recently, about two million White Russians residing in Japan and wandering in various countries around the world are secretly plotting the restoration of the imperial system and the establishment of a new independent White Russian state. They are uniting the four major systems of old Russia to form the "Alliance for Believing in the Emperor and Protecting the Motherland," with Duke Kirill as the leader and Count Gokovsky as the minister, with the headquarters in Paris. All White Russians around the world are under its control, and more than 40 branches have been established in the Far East, publishing the organ news "Revival" and "Newspaper." Their planned plan is to first seek the independence of Siberia and create a new imperial state. On the one hand, they are promoting Holbad as the commander-in-chief of the Eastern Russian Great Harmony Association, and it is said that an important instruction to attack the Soviets has been issued, which will invade Siberia from northern Manchuria. (It is noted that the activities of the White Russians in northern Manchuria are originally backed by Japan. Japan is using the means of using barbarians to control barbarians, instigating the White Russians to disturb Siberia and contain the actions of Soviet Russia against Japan. This trick is just like using Chinese traitors to plot rebellion and create a puppet state.)</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Moscow on the 20th: In the past half month, many Soviet Russian officials stationed in Harbin, including staff members of the consulate, have set off to return to Moscow. Since the Sino-Russian conflict in 1929, important Russian officials have never returned to their countries in such a rush. As a result, rumors are rampant, but according to those familiar with the situation, the Russian capital wants important officials to return to the country to report on the situation in the Far East. Their departure may be related to the detention of Soviet Russian people, because since the end of March this year, the authorities in Harbin have accused the Russians of participating in rebellious conspiracies and detained many people, and the trial has not been opened for a long time. It is expected that if the arrested people are not released immediately, or if they are tried immediately, Soviet Russia will take action.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency dispatch from Changchun on the 24th: It has just been learned that the Soviet Russian government will summon all important Russian officials of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Russian Consul General in Harbin back to Moscow to hold a meeting. There are different interpretations of the purpose of this move.</p>

<p>The Miserable Situation of the People in the Northeast</p>
<p>TASS dispatch from Berlin on the 24th: The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung published a report from its special reporter sent from Harbin, describing the current miserable situation in the Manchurian countryside, which is unbearable to read. The reporter stated that he met an old Chinese man in a village who smiled bitterly at the guest, and then showed an empty iron can, expressing his apology for not having tea to offer the guest. All he could entertain the guest with was the fire in the stove under the ruined wall. Wild dogs run around in the deserted streets, and wisps of smoke rise from the top of a ruined factory. The wind swept and roared. In the past, this was one of the richest soybean producing areas in the area, with freight cars constantly on the road carrying the finished products to Harbin and Vladivostok. The towns and villages built on the ground were as prosperous as American cities. However, since the Sino-Japanese conflict, the land has changed hands and has been plundered and destroyed. All those who are able have fled to Harbin. When the railway was first repaired and opened to Harbin, farmers and small businessmen took their families and possessions and abandoned their destroyed villages. The congestion was indescribable, and the deserted villages gave people a terrible impression. The doors and windows were temporarily locked, the tea sets were still messy on the table, the broom was lying across the ground, and the musical instruments were hanging empty on the walls. Only the hanging pictures still showed the residents wearing their Chinese clothes in peacetime, with smiles on their faces. The reporter concluded by saying that this miserable situation reminded people of the villages invaded by the Black Death in the Middle Ages, when the plague killed most of the lives in the village, and the few survivors fled, and the scene in the village was so desolate.</p>

<p>Germany Demands Equality in Armaments</p>
<p>Italian Newspaper Defends Forcefully</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency dispatch from Paris on the 24th: Raemros, a famous budget expert and member of the French parliament, told a reporter from the Paris Times that the fortresses built around Metz and along the Alsatian border in recent years are very solid and absolutely impossible to break. No matter how well-equipped the army is, if it dares to invade, it will only bring disaster on itself. According to Rai, he recently toured the new territories of France in the Treaty of Versailles and returned, and was very impressed with the fortress construction projects built by the French army on the new French-German border since 1919.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency dispatch from Rome on the 24th: Today, the Italian newspaper La Stampa commented, forcefully defending the principle of equality in armaments repeatedly demanded by the German representatives at the Disarmament Conference, saying that Germany's demand for equal treatment in armaments is more justified than its demand for suspending reparations, because its demand for equality in armaments is directly based on the Treaty of Versailles, because Germany's reduction in armaments at that time was conditional on other countries also reducing their armaments. Now that various countries have failed to complete the first step towards disarmament, Germany naturally has the right to demand that it no longer be bound by restrictions on armaments.</p>

<p>Advocates Revising War Debts</p>
<p>Contains Important Meaning</p>
<p>French Newspapers Change from Attacking to Praising</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from New York on the 25th: Senator Borah's proposal to immediately convene a world conference to consider revising or abolishing war debts is of great significance, because Borah is a stalwart of the agricultural faction, and representatives of the agricultural faction mostly strongly oppose amending war debts. Borah said that debts should be repaid, and that the only reason he advocates revising or abolishing them is for the benefit of the American people. Borah's remarks are noteworthy. This kind of feeling seems to be spreading gradually, but those in Congress who oppose the amendment do not agree. Borah advocated that this world conference should deal with issues such as disarmament, restoring the gold standard, and leveling silver prices in the East. The reason why this proposal is valued is not only because Borah is the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but also because Borah is an important spokesperson on international events in the US Congress. Borah denied the claim that he had changed his previous attitude. He repeatedly stated that he would still oppose the cancellation of war debts without agreements such as disarmament treaties to assist him.</p>
<p>Kokumin News Agency dispatch from Paris on the 25th: After US Senator Borah's declaration supporting the amendment or even the cancellation of all war debts was broadcast throughout Europe today, it has had a profound impression here. For the first time today, French newspapers stopped attacking Borah and replaced it with praise. However, those who praised Borah mostly belonged to left-wing newspapers.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Trial Begins for the Assassination of President Doumer <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Court is Full of Spectators</p>
<p>The Assassin Does Not Appear to Have a Mental Illness</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch from the National Society, 25th: The trial of Russian doctor Goguloff, the assassin of the late French President Doumer, began this afternoon in the criminal court here. It is expected that this case will be concluded quickly. If the jury believes that the assassination was premeditated, the assassin is expected to be executed by guillotine before the end of August. The French are paying close attention to this case. Since dawn, people have been waiting near the court. When the assassin was brought to court at 12:30, there were no fewer than several thousand spectators outside. Even women in luxurious clothing pleaded to be allowed into the court to observe, but hundreds were politely refused by court officials. Only lawyers and journalists with observation passes were allowed into the court, and each pass had a photograph of the holder attached to prevent swapping, showing how strict the restrictions were. The assassin's demeanor was also slightly different from before. He sat in the defendant's dock, guarded by two armed police officers. He is over six feet tall and immensely strong. After Court President Delaitre read out the charges, he told the twelve jurors that, under normal circumstances, the only sentence for this case would be execution by guillotine. However, if the jurors believed there was still room for doubt, the court could sentence him to life imprisonment with hard labor. If the jurors believed the assassin suffered from mental illness, he would be sent to a criminal asylum for life. The defendant's lawyer stated that the examination report submitted by the three legal psychiatric experts, indicating that the assassin was of sound mind, contained many points that could be disputed. He would base his defense on the assassin's mental illness and would call his former colleagues and school friends as witnesses. After the trial began, the prosecutor presented the jurors with an eighty-page report from the psychiatric experts, stating that the assassin's crime could not be attributed to mental illness, and that the assassin was mentally and physically sound, and that the assassin must bear full responsibility for this case. While this report was being read, the defendant seemed uneasy, as if he wanted to declare the examination unfair.</p>
<p>Paris Dispatch from Reuters, 25th: The court trying Goguloff, the assassin of French President Doumer, was packed with spectators today, and the surrounding streets were also full. When the presiding judge read the charges, the assassin's lawyer rose to say that the three medical experts for the prosecution had determined that the defendant was of sound mind, while the three experts for the defense believed that Goguloff had a mental illness. Whether Goguloff escapes the guillotine will depend entirely on the testimony of the medical experts during the trial. It is expected that this case will be decided soon.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Japan's Finances After the September 18th Incident <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence: Huai Ren</p>
<p>Time passes quickly, and the second anniversary of September 18th is approaching. Recalling the story of the Japanese army shelling the Beida Camp one night is like yesterday. In this fleeting year, Japan has obviously and substantially obtained the right to govern the three northeastern provinces. People of the yellow-uniformed class have, as they wished, strolled between the Black Water and White Mountains, singing their "Kimi ga Yo" song. But what about the other side of the coin? Obviously, there are very clear financial cracks on the three islands. Although we cannot say that these cracks are a harbinger of the empire's collapse, at least in the depths of these cracks, there seems to be a terrifying element.</p>
<p>Budget Implemented in Showa 7 (This Year)</p>
<p>Revenue Yuan</p>
<p>Regular Section 1,281,940,000</p>
<p>Temporary Section 498,468,000</p>
<p>Ordinary Revenue 45,096,000</p>
<p>Reserve Fund 453,372,000</p>
<p>Total 1,780,408,000</p>
<p>Expenditure Yuan</p>
<p>Regular Section 1,205,680,000</p>
<p>Temporary Section 574,728,000</p>
<p>Total 1,780,408,000</p>
<p>In this revenue budget of 1,780,408,000 yuan, 453,372,000 yuan from the reserve fund, accounting for more than one-quarter of the total revenue. The amount of more than 400 million yuan of public debt raised is indeed a very alarming figure. But this is not all. There is also 76,179,000 yuan of public debt in the special account section. In total, the amount of public debt issued by Japan this year will be 529,551,000 yuan. This flood of public debt is indeed a material worth noting in the recent financial history of Japan.</p>
<p>Now let's further examine the contents of this huge public debt amount:</p>
<p>General Account Yuan</p>
<p>Manchurian Incident Expenses Public Debt 249,045,000</p>
<p>Deficit Public Debt 160,546,000</p>
<p>Various Project Public Debt 43,780,000</p>
<p>Total 453,372,000</p>
<p>Special Account Project Public Debt Manchurian Incident Expenses Public Debt</p>
<p>Yuan</p>
<p>Governor-General of Korea 19,240,000 334,000</p>
<p>Governor-General of Taiwan 3,000,000</p>
<p>Kwantung Government 600,000 3,005,000</p>
<p>Sakhalin Government 1,000,000</p>
<p>Railway Special Account 49,000,000</p>
<p>Total 72,840,000 3,339,000</p>
<p>Total of General Account and Special Account 529,551,000</p>
<p>This statistical table clearly tells us that the interior of the more than 500 million yuan of public debt includes 252,384,000 yuan of Manchurian Incident expenses. In other words, one-half of Japan's financial difficulty this year is due to the September 18th Incident. From January to May of this year, in fact, 291,849,675 yuan of public debt has already been issued, including 113,371,550 yuan of Manchurian Incident expenses public debt, accounting for about one-half of the planned issue amount (to be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Soviet Russia Withdraws Consulates from Northern Manchuria <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p> Soviet Banks and Companies Also Close Down</p>
<p>More Than 80,000 Red Army Troops Deployed Around Manchuli</p>
<p>The Reason is the Puppet State's Forcible Takeover of the Docks in the Eight Districts</p>
<p>Japanese Troops are Also Preparing to Send Troops to Boketu</p>
<p>Black Dragon River Correspondence: Soviet consuls stationed in various parts of Northern Manchuria, under orders from the Moscow government, will all lower their flags and return to their country within the next week. The Deputy Consul in Harbin, Rasiman, and the Consul in Dalian, Island Stezki, returned home on the 17th. The Soviet Far East Bank in Harbin has also been ordered to expedite its closure and await further instructions to cease operations. Yesterday, the bank transferred important documents and cash to the American Citibank for safekeeping. Some employees plan to return home around the 24th. The Soviet Far East Grain and Stone Trading Company and the Overseas Trading Company are also planning to close down within the next week. At the same time, the number of Soviet troops stationed inside and outside Manchuli has recently increased to more than 80,000. From Station No. 87 to Ulan-Ude, east to Abagaitu, and west to the shores of Lake Baikal, the Red Army is densely deployed, displaying their armor and conducting artillery and air combat exercises. On the 17th and 18th, more than 20 heavy artillery and aircraft conducted exercises in the skies over the Abagaitu border, conducting bombing and strafing exercises. Several hundred shells were fired each day, and the sound could be heard for more than ten miles. Houses in the area between Manchuli and Zhalantun were shaken. Due to the tense situation, merchants and residents closed their businesses, packed their furniture, and moved to Harbin and Heihe. Rumors are rampant between Hailar and Boketu. Merchants and residents along the western line of the East China Railway are moving to Harbin one after another, presenting a situation similar to that before the war. The reason for this change in attitude by Soviet Russia is the seizure of the docks in the Eight Districts of the Jiangbin area by the puppet Jiangyun Office. The resentment accumulated for more than ten months is about to be vented in one day. Therefore, the docks in the Eight Districts have become the fuse for the recent breakdown in relations between Japan and Russia. Last week, Sugihara, the Japanese Director of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Northern Manchurian Negotiation Office, returned from Changchun and replied in writing to the Russian consulate in Harbin, explaining the takeover of the docks in the Eight Districts. However, the Russian consul refused to accept his note. The puppet office sent it three times, but it was rejected each time, and it declared that it would terminate direct negotiations with Manchuria from now on, clearly indicating its refusal to recognize the puppet state. On the Japanese side, preparations are being made to withdraw troops to the western line, intending to first hold the key points of the Xing'an Mountains, Hailar, Mian Duhe, and Boketu, and defend the area based on the terrain. On the other hand, it incited the puppet state to make concessions on the issue of the takeover of the docks in the Eight Districts, allowing the East China Railway to continue to sign leases, and canceling the double taxation on Russian imports at the Manchuli sub-customs, and handling it in accordance with the treaty signed between Nanjing and Soviet Russia. However, since Soviet Russia has already changed its attitude and has a definite foreign policy, it is no longer possible for the Japanese side to use the puppet state to ease its momentum. Two days ago, the Russian Consul-General in Harbin, Silausky, visited Zhang Jinghui, the Chief Executive of the Puppet Special District, and asked whether he was still under the orders of the Chinese government regarding the takeover of the docks in the Eight Districts and whether he was prepared to negotiate. If Zhang was still a Chinese official, Soviet Russia would begin negotiations with him on this matter. Zhang could not answer, and his Japanese advisor, Arai, responded on his behalf, answering that the matter was a diplomatic issue and could be handled directly with the negotiators. The Russian consul left displeased. On the 16th, more than 50 bandits hijacked the third passenger train from Harbin to Manchuli at the Boketu Yalu station on the Harbin-Manchuli line, killing seven railway protection soldiers and wounding more than ten soldiers and passengers. They left without looting. Afterwards, some said that it was the Japanese side using White Russians to disrupt the Harbin-Manchuli line, using the excuse that traffic was obstructed to send troops to protect it. This saying has gradually been confirmed in recent days, because the Japanese side has publicized this matter greatly and is preparing to send the 10th Division to Boketu first. (20th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">On the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Line <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Side Continues to Reinforce Troops</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Insists on Extending the Railway to Beipiao</p>
<p>Japanese Troops from Shenyang Are Also Heading West</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The situation in Rehe has eased in recent days. At 7 pm on the 21st, a phone call came from Chengde, reporting that the local area was as calm as usual. The Rehe army is still stationed in Nanling. After negotiations between representatives and the Japanese army, both sides agreed not to attack each other and to cease military operations. The Rehe side is responsible for finding the whereabouts of Kwon Shiro Ishimoto. The Japanese troops stationed in the Chaoyangsi unit were still stationed near the station defense area on the afternoon of the 20th. The Jinzhou-Chaoyang branch line has been opened to traffic. According to news from Chaoyang, the Japanese troops stationed in Chaoyangsi are preparing to retreat. This proves that there is indeed a possibility of easing tensions. When the incident occurred, the Japanese army used the Ishimoto incident as an excuse to advance and clashed with the Zhang camp stationed in Chaoyangsi. At that time, our garrison withdrew to Nanling, which is a vital position, because it had not received orders. Nanling is a station on the Chaoyang line, with a tunnel passing through the ridge. Our army destroyed the tunnel to prevent the Japanese armored vehicles from advancing, so the Japanese army could not advance further west. Chaoyangsi is the border between Rehe and Liaoning, 20 miles from Yixian, 90 miles from Chaoyang, and 90 miles from Beipiao. Nanling is 8 miles from Chaoyangsi. After the situation eased, the Japanese troops in Chaoyangsi withdrew to Yixian, but a few remained in Chaoyangsi. Regarding the Ishimoto incident, which the Japanese used as an excuse, Ishimoto did not notify the local authorities when he entered the country, and our side did not know that he had entered the country. Since the Japanese side said that he was missing, in terms of friendship, our side could also help to find him. However, the Japanese Chief of Staff Yoshioka is very familiar with the strong resistance of the residents of Rehe and it is not easy to compromise, so the incident has eased. However, the Japanese side is determined to extend the Jinzhou-Chaoyang railway to Beipiao.</p>
<p>According to people from Rehe, the Rehe provincial authorities have sent a letter to the Japanese side, questioning why the Japanese used the excuse that Ishimoto was kidnapped by bandits to attack the Rehe border. If Ishimoto was really kidnapped by bandits, the Rehe authorities could have helped to find him if they had been notified by the Japanese side in advance. They could not attack because a person was missing, causing a military conflict. It is said that after receiving the letter, the Japanese side withdrew its troops and there have been no unexpected actions to date. Now both sides are trying to find Ishimoto's whereabouts. According to one version, the Japanese army is still continuing to reinforce troops on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang line, and the future is not optimistic. According to news received on the 22nd, Chengde is still peaceful. Our garrison is at the forefront in the Nanling-Beipiao area, while the Japanese troops are stationed in Yixian and Chaoyangsi. After negotiations between the two sides in recent days, (1) both sides ceased military operations; (2) Kwon Shiro Ishimoto's whereabouts will be investigated clearly before a rescue is attempted. According to intelligence from Shenyang, Japanese troops are continuing to move west towards Liaoxi, and their purpose is unknown. It is feared that they are still paying attention to Rehe. The volunteer army near Yixian is lurking in the deep mountains and forests, occasionally ambushing the Japanese army's rear. The Japanese army is often trapped by the volunteer army because the mountain roads are rugged and the terrain is unfamiliar. Therefore, the Japanese army does not dare to advance. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Volunteer Army <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Plots to Seize Shenyang</p>
<p>Zhu Rongji's Plan Fails and He is Arrested</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zhu Rongji (41 years old), the leader of the volunteer army in Liaoxi, was a former subordinate of Zhang Xueliang. Since the loss of the Northeast, Zhu was pained by the national crisis, so he gathered the volunteer army to operate in the counties west of Liaoning. In January and February of this year, he had the ambition to recover Shenyang. He sent 600 subordinates to sneak into Shenyang from Liuhezi. Zhu also personally accompanied Chief of Staff Ge Zonghai (43 years old) and Staff Zhu Changjiu (27 years old) to Shenyang to secretly investigate the security situation of Japan and the puppet state. He also purchased a large number of military supplies from Japanese ronin in Shenyang, planning to lead 600 volunteer soldiers to launch a night attack in Shenyang on the 7th of this month. Outside the city, Wang Zhichao and Liu Haiquan would lead the majority of the volunteer army to attack in coordination. Unfortunately, the Japanese army detected the plan in advance, and Zhu and the other two were arrested one after another. Therefore, on the night of the 7th, the volunteer army led by Wang and Liu launched a fierce attack on Liaoyang City from outside the city, but because there was no response from within, they retreated without winning.

<h3 id="e76">Marine Corps Goes to Fujian <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Chen Jitang Has Sent a Guard Brigade to Take Over</p>
<p>Chen Ce's Fleet is Divided</p>
<p>Establish a Pacification Office and Abolish the Qiongya Special District</p>
<p>Wu Chaoshu Advocates Limiting the Number of Troops Stationed in Qiongya</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The conflict between the two Chens has come to an end after the mediation of Cai Tingkai and others. Before going to Fujian, Cai Tingkai sent Tan Qixiu, a brigade commander of the 19th Route Army, and Weng Guiqing, personnel from the rear of the route army, to Qiongya to handle the Marine Corps' departure to Fujian. On the 15th, Tan telegraphed Chen Ce from Qiongya, stating that he had arrived in Qiongya on the evening of the 14th and had decided to leave Qiongya with Chen Ji (commander of the Marine Corps regiment) and all the officers on the 19th, and that he had telegraphed Chen Zhangfu to lead the team to cross over to Qiongya to take over the defense. He was afraid that there would not be enough ships, so he asked to transfer the Fuan warship to Qiongya. After receiving the telegram, Chen Ce ordered Wu Zili, the captain of the Fuan warship, to go to Qiongya from Hong Kong on the 16th to pick up the Marine Corps stationed in Qiongya to go to Fujian. After Tan Qixiu had inspected all the regiments of the Marine Corps in Qiongya, he ordered the Marine Corps' 4th Regiment, led by Li Hansheng, to set off on a merchant ship on the 18th. The remaining 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Regiments also disembarked on the 18th. According to Chen Ce, the Marine Corps' trip to Fujian was not a reorganization. It would still use the name of the Marine Corps to cooperate with the 19th Route Army to suppress bandits. As for the fleet, such as Zhongshan, Fuan, Hairui, etc., were still under his command, while the six shallow-water warships that could not go to sea, which were currently berthed in Hong Kong, were handed back to the Guangdong Provincial Government for management. As for Chen Jitang, since Chen Ce's troops had left Qiongya one after another, he ordered Chen Zhangfu, a member of the Southern Route Pacification Committee, to send a team to Qiongya to take over the defense. After receiving the order, Chen drew from Leizhou Chen Hanguang's guard brigade, He Baoshu's 2nd Regiment, and Peng Zhifang's 3rd Regiment, and sent them to Haikou. Chen Hanguang led Chen Yuguang's 1st Regiment to Qiongya on the 18th, and set up a brigade headquarters in Haikou. Chen Zhangfu also decided to go to Qiongya within a few days to inspect everything. As for the six ships stationed in Hong Kong, Jiang, Jiang Da, Zhixin, Pingxi, Hushan, and Xixing, Chen Jitang has sent personnel to Hong Kong to discuss the takeover, so that they can return to the province.</p>
<p>Regarding the aftermath of Qiongya, on the 16th, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee also ordered the Guangdong Provincial Government that all the people's wealth, politics, and all construction matters in Qiongya should be earnestly taken care of by the provincial government. After receiving the order, the provincial government ordered the former county magistrates of Qiongya who had left their posts to return to their counties by the 25th of this month, otherwise they would be considered to have abandoned their posts. As for the pacification of the local area, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee separately ordered the First Group Army to set up a Qiongya Pacification Office to handle everything. It is said that after the Pacification Office is established, the Qiongya Special District plan may be cancelled. Recently, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee has discussed this issue, because someone has petitioned the government to abolish the Qiongya Special District system, and some have attacked Wu Chaoshu, the chief of the Qiongya Special District, because of this Qiongya affair. However, Wu still sent a letter to Chen Jitang in the name of the chief of the special district, requesting to limit the number of troops taking over Qiongya, fearing that although the Qiongya military affairs will be resolved in the future, there will still be some political waves, because one side wants to abolish the Qiongya Special District system, while the other side wants to maintain the original plan, and their political views are still not fully in line. The following is an excerpt from Wu's letter to Chen, so as to clarify Wu's political views on governing Qiongya: "As the nominal chief of the Qiongya district, I have given some thought to the cooperative method between the special district government and your group army's (referring to the First Group Army) troops stationed in Qiongya in the future. I have found that when the banditry in Qiongya was rampant in 1928, Chief Ye Zhaozhao of your unit only led a regiment of troops to Haikou, divided into several routes to search and suppress, and was determined to drive them out. Within a few days, great results were achieved. To this day, the people of Qiongya still praise him, which shows that the success or failure of the army's suppression of bandits does not depend on the number of troops. Now the banditry in the Qiongya district is about the same as in 1928. I think that 1,500 to 2,000 troops stationed in Qiongya is enough. This is the first thing that should be discussed. Since this unit is specifically going to Qiongya to suppress bandits, the military pay required can be raised locally. However, the Qiongya district's monthly income is only more than 100,000 yuan, so there should be a certain limit to the supply of military pay, so as not to hinder other administrative facilities. It is proposed that the special district government raise 35,000 to 40,000 yuan in silver dollars per month. If there is a shortfall, your unit will still raise it. This is the second thing that should be discussed. On February 27 of this year, I reported to the Political Affairs Committee, stating that the Marine Corps currently stationed in the Qiongya district can be completely withdrawn when the banditry is slightly suppressed, and that there is no need for central troops to be stationed afterwards. However, the arrival of foreign troubles is difficult to predict. When necessary, the chief of the special district should report to the central government, or consult with nearby chiefs, to send land, sea, and air forces to protect it, so as to strengthen national defense, etc. Now the Qiongya District Government is established within a few days, and it is expected that the security team will be fully organized in about three months. At that time, it is proposed that the troops sent by your unit be withdrawn from Qiongya to comply with the original plan. This is the third thing that should be discussed. In short, your unit's trip to Qiongya to suppress bandits is very welcome. The above three points are purely based on facts, so that the military and political affairs and the people's wealth and politics can each be properly divided and conducive to implementation." Judging from Wu's letter, he not only asked Chen Jitang to limit the number of troops going to Qiongya, but also asked Chen's troops to withdraw if necessary. However, Chen Jitang wants to include Qiongya in his scope with the strength of a lion fighting a rabbit. It is unknown what answer he will give to Wu's request. (July 19th)</p>

<p>Reorganization of Two Columns</p>
<p>Xiang Hanping Goes to Nanxiong to Arrange Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Guangzhou correspondence: Since the Guangdong army repelled the Communist bandits who attacked Nanxiong, it has recently been continuously increasing its troop strength on the border. However, it has not yet launched a large-scale encirclement because the main force of the Communist bandits is still in Xinfeng, while the remaining small number are still active in the San'nan area on the Jiangxi border, appearing as if they are waiting for an opportunity to invade the Guangdong border again. Therefore, Chen Jitang, for the sake of prudence, has telegraphed the Independent First Division under Huang Renhuan and the Independent Second Division under Zhang Ruigui, stationed in Dongjiang, to guard Xunwu, Lianping, and Heping on the Jiangxi border. The Eighth Division under Huang Zhiwen has also been ordered to suspend its return to the province and temporarily station in Xingning and Wuhua to assist in defending the northeastern border, awaiting further orders. As for the units in the Beijiang area, they are now organized into two columns. The first column is commanded by Yu Hanmou, and the second column is commanded by Xiang Hanping. However, news from Daju to Nanxiong is still not clear, and traffic above the Zhongzhan station in Nanxiong has not yet been restored. The Guangdong military authorities are currently building fortifications above Nanxiong. The Nanxiong airfield has been renovated and completed. Six aircraft from the Second Air Force Squadron and two from the Fourth Squadron have departed for Nanxiong to scout the bandit situation ahead. The Guangdong army in Nanxiong currently includes Li Hanun's Independent Third Division, Chen Zhangfu's Second Independent Brigade, Deng Longguang's Training Division, the four regiments of Zhang Da's unit of the Fifth Division of the Second Army, and the remnants of Zhang Meixin's Fourth Division, who retreated from Xinfeng, totaling about fifteen or sixteen regiments. All are under the command of Xiang Hanping, the commander of the Second Column. After receiving the order, Xiang departed for Shao on the 16th and arrived in Shaoguan at 5:00 PM that day. In Shao, he summoned officers of all ranks for a bandit suppression meeting to discuss and determine a plan for encircling and suppressing the Communist bandits. He telegraphed Chen Jitang in Guangzhou and Yu Hanmou in Daju, Chen Cheng in Ganzhou, He Jian in Hunan Province, and Mao Weishou on the Fujian border, in order to carry out a large-scale encirclement when the time comes. The next day, Xiang, accompanied by Chief of Staff Tan Da, flew to Nanxiong to inspect the troops and inspect the fortifications, and to discuss the pursuit and suppression with the officers in Nanxiong. Subsequently, as the local Communists above Nanxiong had not yet been wiped out, a special order was issued to the troops at the front to expedite the suppression. Therefore, on the 17th and 18th, the Chen Zhang Brigade and Zhang Da Division at the front attacked Dayuanli. More than a thousand bandits were eventually unable to hold out and retreated to Datangzhai. Government troops are still suppressing them. On the 19th, another order was issued to search and advance towards Xinfeng, with the fresh troops of Chen Hengjie's regiment taking the lead. As for the Guangxi army under Wang Zanbin, they concentrated in Juntian on the 20th and immediately departed for Shaoguan. It is heard that Commander Wang will go to the front on the 21st, and will also be under the command of Xiang Hanping. (July 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e78">Hunan Provincial Government Asks the Central Government <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>To Limit Troop Recruitment in Hunan</p>
<p>Changsha correspondence: In recent years, a large number of armies have come to Hunan Province to recruit soldiers, and in recent months, there has hardly been a day without recruiters coming to Hunan. Fearing that this would lead to malpractices, the Hunan Provincial Government has petitioned the Military Affairs Commission and consulted the Ministry of Military Affairs to order all armies to limit recruitment in Hunan. The text presented to the Military Affairs Commission is recorded below: "Your Excellency, the province previously, because the Communist bandits and local bandits have not been completely eliminated and are being closely suppressed, is deeply concerned that the various troops coming to Hunan to recruit soldiers and laborers will give the bandits and Communists in the counties an opportunity to infiltrate, causing endless harm to the army and the local area in the future. In May of the 18th year, we petitioned Your Excellency to order all armies not to recruit in Hunan again, and the order was approved on file. Subsequently, due to the urgent military situation of bandit suppression, when the armies in various places have vacancies, they still send personnel from time to time to contact us and ask for convenience. The Provincial Government believes that serving as a soldier is a citizen's duty and cannot be strictly rejected. We can only formulate measures that all those who come to Hunan to recruit must have an area designated by the Provincial Government to show restrictions, and at the same time notify the counties and military police agencies to take care of them. This kind of procedure is already very cumbersome. In recent years, personnel have been sent from various places to Hunan to recruit soldiers almost every day. Each county has recruitment offices, as many as a dozen. The reason why recruiters are concentrated here is simply because the people of Hunan are able to endure hardship and are easy to train. However, the harm suffered by the province is indescribable. Most of the recruits are farmers and workers who are healthy and strong, who can support themselves in their hometowns. Once someone recruits them, they think they can eat without farming and wear clothes without weaving. They abandon their original occupations and follow suit. Some who have been in the army for a long time become accustomed to the prosperity of the city. When they are demobilized or disbanded, they despise the rural life of the past, gather in cities, and become unemployed vagrants. They even privately hide firearms, collude with bandits, gather in the mountains and forests, and habitually rob. In recent years, most of the bandit cases solved everywhere are retired soldiers, which is clear evidence. Moreover, soldiers from Hunan Province account for the majority of the troops. In the event of casualties, the chief officers rarely care. All pensions are transferred by the Ministry of Military Affairs to Hunan Province for payment. Recently, the national and local taxes pay more than one million in pensions every year, which is a special expenditure not found in other provinces. Now, after the soldiers and bandits in the province, there is also a natural disaster. The strong are scattered in all directions, and laborers are recruited, making it difficult to cope. If recruitment continues like this and all the strong men are incorporated into the army, the fields will be barren and the industry will be in decline, which will affect the social economy and local security to a great extent. We propose that you observe the local situation and allow all armies not to send personnel to Hunan for recruitment in the future. If it is necessary to recruit in Hunan due to the actual needs, the number should be limited by each unit and reported to the Ministry of Military Affairs for approval, which will then be transferred to the Provincial Government for handling in accordance with the regulations to show caution. All the reasons for restricting recruitment in Hunan are reported to Your Excellency in addition to consulting the Ministry of Military Affairs, and we ask for your approval and instructions to be obeyed. Respectfully presented."</p>
<h3 id="e79">Anhui People Thoroughly Investigate Malpractices in Disaster Relief Work in Northern Anhui <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu correspondence: After the representatives of the twenty-one counties in northern Anhui, who were receiving disaster relief, reported the case of provincial officials in charge of disaster relief and transportation personnel engaging in private corruption and delaying disaster relief work, the National Government's Relief Commission and the Control Yuan successively sent personnel to Bengbu to investigate. However, due to the failure to find conclusive evidence of corruption, the case could not be handed over to the court. The representatives of the twenty-one counties in northern Anhui, who were receiving disaster relief, believed that the investigators had failed to conduct a thorough investigation and expressed great dissatisfaction. They again petitioned the National Government's Relief Commission to send impartial personnel, together with representatives from the Anhui Fellow Association in Beijing and Shanghai, to form an investigation delegation to thoroughly investigate the truth of the malpractices. The National Government's Relief Commission specially sent Sun Yunsheng and Wang Chusheng, and the Anhui Fellow Association in Shanghai appointed Yue Xiangru and Lü Yin'nan, while the Anhui Fellow Association in Shanghai and Beijing appointed Shi Dechun and Wang Zhaoquan to jointly form an investigation delegation to conduct a thorough investigation. Sun and others arrived in Bengbu together a few days ago and conducted a detailed investigation into the various truths of the slow delivery of relief wheat, price changes into flour, reduced distribution quantities, late release of urgent needs, changes in distribution, appointment of private individuals, and embezzlement of relief funds. They also sought opinions from all parties to provide evidence. The members of the Post-Disaster Relief Association in northern Anhui specially held a meeting at Bamu Garden at 5:00 PM on the 20th to welcome the delegation. Shi Dechun and Wang Chusheng gave speeches, expressing their opinions on investigating the case, stating that they would conduct an impartial investigation and would never be lenient. Representatives from various counties gave extremely painful reports, especially criticizing Quan Shaowu, the Commissioner of Disaster Relief in Northern Anhui, for his sloppy work and delay in disaster relief. It is now known that Quan Shaowu has returned to his hometown of Beiping on the pretext of a poor environmental air, and various parties speculate that he has fled with embezzled funds. Whether this is true or not remains to be verified by the delegation's thorough investigation. (July 21st)</p>

<p>Record of the Court Hearing of the Ma Xu Lawsuit It is reported that Ma Baolin, a middle school student in Suzhou County, and Xu Caizhen, a female vocational student, an unmarried couple, both committed suicide by poisoning. Ma died from the poisoning, and Xu was saved after medical treatment. Afterwards, Xu, as an unmarried wife, requested to observe chastity for Ma, but Ma's family firmly refused, which led to a mutual fight between Xu Caizhen and Ma's stepmother, Zhang. Both were slightly injured. The two sides then hired lawyers to file a complaint with the local court. Zhang accused Xu Caizhen of trespassing and assault. The case was heard yesterday (25th). At 8:30 AM, Xu Caizhen and her mother, Xu Tang, arrived at the court. Many of Xu's relatives arrived, and the audience was extremely crowded. Those who arrived later had almost no place to stand. The court opened at 10:26 AM. Xu hired lawyer Ma Heng, and Ma's side hired three lawyers, Lu Hongyi, Zhou Yuong, and Gu Enpei, to appear in court for defense. As a result, it was ordered that the two sides try to reconcile outside the court. If reconciliation fails, the court will hold another hearing. The court will conduct an investigation and schedule a continued hearing, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<p>The Addition of Vehicle Permits Caused a Dispute The Wuxian Education Bureau previously owed a huge amount of 170,000 yuan in education fees. It agreed with the Construction Bureau to add 500 rickshaw permits, collecting a deposit of 160 yuan per permit, totaling 80,000 yuan, to pay the education fees. The added vehicle permits were distributed to the members of the Rickshaw Trade Association according to the number of vehicles they originally had. Unexpectedly, this aroused the opposition of non-members, who requested the Education Bureau and the Party Department for relief, demanding to be allocated the vehicle permits. The County Party Department convened talks between the two sides on the morning of the 25th and invited members of the Education and Construction Bureaus to attend. After a period of talks, there was no result. The various trade associations in Wuxian County have now submitted a request to the Construction Department for an explanation of whether non-members can enjoy the rights. It is difficult to resolve for the time being.</p>
<p>Shop Owner Rapes Teenage Girl Yu Yirong, who runs a salted fish shop on Hengjie Street outside Fengmen, has a maid, Zhang Maotou, who is 18 years old and quite beautiful. In March of this year, when Yu Yirong's wife returned to her mother's home, Yu Yirong took the opportunity to go to Zhang Maotou's room and raped Zhang Maotou by means of intimidation. Zhang Maotou's father heard about it and immediately ordered his daughter to quit her job and work for the Peng family on Shiquan Street. The day before yesterday, Yu sent a stranger, Zha Qiaomei, to the Peng family to persuade Zhang Maotou, saying that Yu intended to take Zhang Maotou as a concubine. Unexpectedly, the girl's father found out and twisted Yu and Zha to the police station in charge. After a brief interrogation, the case was transferred to the court for interrogation on the grounds that it involved the rape of a woman under the age of twenty.</p>

<p>Ruichangrun Accused of Embezzlement Ruichangrun Silk Cocoon Warehouse under Gongyun Bridge in this county has been established for many years and its business is quite good. It can be regarded as the leader in the industry. On the 9th of last month, Yichun Baoyu Cocoon Firm came to Wuxi to store 190 bales of dry cocoons in the warehouse. At that time, the cocoon bales were selected and weighed, and there was no difference in weight. When Baoyu Cocoon Firm went to pick up the goods on the 12th of this month, it suddenly found that the bale corners were moved. Each bale was 6 or 7 catties less, while the ten or so bales at the bottom were not moved, and the weight increased by a certain amount compared to the original weight. The manager of Baoyu Cocoon Firm, Yu Baosan, negotiated with Wu Buzhou, the manager of the warehouse. Because the conditions were not suitable, Yu Baosan filed a criminal lawsuit with the County Court Procuratorate, accusing the warehouse of embezzlement in its business. The day before yesterday, Prosecutor Shen opened a court hearing. As a result, the defendant was ordered to pay a written guarantee of 2,000 yuan to wait for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>Zhejiang University Changes Organization</p>
<p>Centralizing Administrative Power in the Secretariat</p>
<p>Military Training and Physical Education Departments Directly Under the President</p>
<p>Abolishing the Dean of Students Office, Replacing it with Student Life Counselors</p>
<p>Hangzhou News: Our reporter, because Zhejiang University President Cheng Tianfang recently returned to Hangzhou, especially went to inquire about the situation of his negotiations for funding in Beijing yesterday. Mr. Cheng received him and said that the presidents' meeting of colleges and universities decided on three measures regarding the funding issue and submitted them to the Executive Yuan, namely (1) full payment starting from July; (2) Promptly clear the arrears of this year; (3) In the future, educational funds must be designated as special funds, such as customs duties and Boxer Indemnity, etc. Later, President Wang formally replied, acknowledging that funding would no longer be in arrears starting from July and would not be discounted. The repayment of old debts was also acknowledged in principle, but the timing of repayment was not determined. As for the third item, the Executive Yuan did not agree. Mr. Cheng also expressed his opinions on the organizational changes of Zhejiang University, saying that since he came to Zhejiang University three months ago, the most peculiar thing he felt was that Zhejiang University had no complete organizational regulations in the past. The organization of each college was different from each other and extremely complicated. The documents, accounting affairs, student affairs, and libraries of each college were independent of each other and not subordinate to each other, with many shortcomings. For example, each college had to set up such staff, which was numerous, resulting in large salaries and a waste of resources. Each college acted on its own, which caused various difficulties in university administration. When the Secretariat had something to contact with the colleges, it had to use official documents, which was no different from the university dealing with external organizations. After I came to Zhejiang University, many teachers and students suggested reforms. This time, when I talked to Minister Zhu in Beijing, Minister Zhu also advocated reform. During the presidents' meeting, the presidents of various universities also advocated that the organization of universities should strive for simplicity. Therefore, I drafted more than 20 articles of Zhejiang University regulations in Beijing, referring to the established cases of other universities. Minister Zhu expressed deep sympathy, and the administrative meeting held today slightly revised and passed them, and they were implemented on the same day. The most important points of these regulations are: (1) Centralizing administrative power in the Secretariat, with the Secretary-General in charge, and setting up six sections: Documentation, Registration, Accounting, General Affairs, Library, and Publication, to handle university affairs. In the future, the deans of each college will only be responsible for teaching affairs and academic equipment, etc. According to this method, staff salaries and office expenses will definitely save a lot, and handling affairs can be faster than before, and it is no longer necessary to communicate with official documents; (2) The Department of Military Training and the Department of Physical Education are directly under the President, so that the entire school can receive unified military and physical education training; (3) Abolish the Dean of Students Office and replace it with student life counselors. National universities do not have a Dean of Students Office. The nature of student life counselors is to live with students and guide them into the right path. After Mr. Cheng finished talking, he presented a copy of the organizational regulations as a gift. They are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education Failed to Take Over Labor University Yesterday</p>
<p>Representatives of Teachers and Students Request Fulfillment of Preconditions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education specially dispatched three commissioners, Dai Xiashu, Yu Dong, and Sen Wen, to Labor University to negotiate. It happened that the school's school protection committee was holding a meeting, and they immediately elected representatives to inquire with the three commissioners about whether there was a satisfactory solution to the preconditions telegraphed to the Ministry of Education by the Labor University Faculty and Staff School Protection Committee a few days ago: (1) officially announce the Labor University revitalization plan; (2) pay off all arrears in salaries for all faculty and staff. The three commissioners replied that they came to the school "only to handle the takeover, and have not heard about any other issues." The faculty and staff representatives of the school believed that the takeover of Labor University was a whole issue, and they could not only take over without considering the labor costs of the faculty and staff, nor could they come to take over before the Executive Yuan's instruction regarding the temporary nature of the closure of Labor University had been discussed. Therefore, the three commissioners agreed to telegraph the Ministry of Education that day to request on their behalf. Later, student representatives of Labor University also came to inquire with the three commissioners about the arrangements for August's food and lodging expenses and transfer travel expenses. It was not until 12 o'clock that Dai and others agreed to come to the school again the day after tomorrow to answer and fulfill them in person, and then they left the school.</p>
<p>Another News: The faculty and staff of Labor University originally planned to take the night train to Beijing on the 24th of this month to petition, but after hearing that the Ministry of Education had appointed three officials, Dai Xiashu, Yu Dong, and Sen Wen, to Shanghai and would come to the school, they issued an emergency notice to temporarily stop leaving the school. Now they are waiting for the result of the three officials' telegram to the Ministry of Education today before deciding whether to proceed or stop.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the school committee also telegraphed Minister Zhu to inquire why the reorganization plan was not announced if there was one. The original telegram is as follows: "Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, Nanjing, in the Shiyeshenbao and Shishi Xinbao, your Excellency announced in the explanation of the government's reorganization of universities that 'the government has carefully decided after a very long discussion on the reorganization plans for Central University, Labor University, Qingdao University, as well as Jinan University, Peiping University, and Normal University,' etc. For Labor University, it has also been carefully discussed for a long time, and there is also a reorganization plan. It should follow the precedent of Central University and Qingdao University and quickly officially announce this reorganization plan to dispel doubts. Respectfully, the Labor University Faculty and Staff School Protection Committee."</p>
<p>Registration of Primary School Teachers in this City</p>
<p>Scheduled Oral Exams and Physical Examinations</p>
<p>The registration of primary school teachers for the 6th term of the Municipal Bureau of Education ended yesterday. The registration was very crowded. It is heard that it has been scheduled that on the 27th, those who registered from No. 1 to No. 100 and No. 201 to No. 300 will have oral exams and physical examinations. On the 28th, those who registered from No. 101 to No. 200 and No. 301 and below will have oral exams and physical examinations.

<p>Jinan University Alumni Association Telegraphed the Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Requesting the Withdrawal of the Order to Abolish the Colleges of Law and Education</p>
<p>Since the Jinan University Alumni Association was reorganized, its work has been very intense. It is recently heard that the government authorities intend to abolish the Colleges of Law and Education of the alma mater. Feeling that Jinan University has special circumstances, they telegraphed the National Government Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education, requesting the withdrawal of the order. The telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>(Omitted above) It is our humble opinion that our alma mater, Jinan University, has been established for 26 years. It is not only a higher institution with a long history in the country, but also has the important mission of developing overseas Chinese education. It should be given special care and vigorously promoted. However, your esteemed Yuan and Ministry have decided to abolish the Colleges of Law and Education, which has caused deep suspicion and shock upon hearing the news. The establishment of the College of Education by the alma mater deeply meets the needs of overseas Chinese, and is dedicated to cultivating teachers for overseas Chinese areas. In addition to Soochow University, which was established by the church and is still of a certain scale, the domestic law schools are only in their infancy. The College of Law of the alma mater is to meet the needs of the times, and especially to cultivate diplomatic talents to serve overseas, develop overseas Chinese affairs, and improve the status of overseas Chinese. It should be given special support. Now that the alma mater is improving in time after the war, and is actively reorganizing in recent months, the various facilities for the 21st year have been planned and are in progress, and many teachers and staff have been hired. If your esteemed Yuan and Ministry also cancel the Colleges of Law and Education, the entire school affairs of the alma mater will be extremely difficult. Therefore, we are particularly asking your esteemed Yuan and Ministry to protect the purpose of the overseas Chinese, and quickly withdraw the order to facilitate development. The overseas Chinese are fortunate, and the overseas Chinese education is fortunate. The telegram is urgent.</p>
<p>Jinan University's Enrollment Registration Deadline Extended</p>
<p>The registration deadline for the current enrollment of National Jinan University was originally scheduled for the 25th of this month. Due to the fact that those who have come to the school to register in the past few days have been exceptionally enthusiastic, and it is estimated that it has exceeded a thousand people, and there are still many who have come from afar and have not had time to register, and they have sent letters and telegrams to request an extension of the registration deadline, the school is particularly accommodating in view of their eagerness to study, and extends the registration deadline by two days, and also facilitates the completion of unfinished procedures. The school is using the Guanghua University for the examination this time. The examination hall has been arranged completely. However, examinees must go to the examination hall before 7:30 to avoid missing the examination period.</p>

Principal He Yizhao reported on the school's affairs, followed by speeches by guests, awards, and the distribution of certificates. The meeting was adjourned. The graduates of this year included Lang Ying, Zheng Fusan, Li Shigen, and Chen Jichun from the senior elementary school section, and Fan Qiongxia, Qian Qishu, Yan Weiqiu, Chen Jiege, and Quan Tianfa from the junior elementary school section. The principal has added a summer school for the convenience of students from various schools who have missed classes due to the Shanghai war and those who have failed grades. The application has been approved and filed by the Municipal Bureau of Education. The school was originally named Yizhao Girls' School. After being registered by the Bureau of Education, it was ordered to be renamed Yizhao Elementary School.</p>
<p>North Shanghai Primary and Secondary Schools Move into New School Building</p>
<p>The North Shanghai Primary and Secondary School on Qiujiang Road has been in operation for fifteen years. Under the careful management of Principal Feng Yixian and Director of Academic Affairs Feng Zhenzhi, it has grown to a considerable scale. After the Shanghai war, the school suffered heavy losses and once stopped enrollment. Now that the fall semester is about to begin, two or three hundred old students have come to the school to request resumption of school. The school, in its duty, has started registering old students and enrolling new students from today. The original school building is no longer suitable, so it has moved into a new four-story Western-style building at No. 587 on the same road from yesterday. The building is spacious and the playground is large. It is also heard that the middle school department has 50 places with reduced fees, and the elementary school department can also reduce tuition fees for those who have financial difficulties.</p>

<p>Starts This Friday</p>
<p>US and France to Vie for Silver Cup</p>
<p>Paris, 24th (Havas) – In the final day of the Davis Cup Europe-America inter-zonal final between the US and Germany, Vines (US) defeated Krahwinkel (Ger) with scores of 3-6, 6-3, 9-7, and 6-3. At this point, the US had already defeated Germany with a score of 3 to 1. The last match was irrelevant to the outcome but was still played. Von Cramm (Ger) defeated Shields (US) with scores of 6-1, 6-0, 6-8, and 6-2. The overall result was a 3-2 victory for the US, which will compete against France in the challenge round on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for three days.</p>
<p>Vines Wins Against Krahwinkel Again</p>
<p>Paris, 24th (Havas) – Today was the third day of the Davis Cup match between the US and Germany. The weather was clear and the stands were full. In the first match, Vines (US) played against Krahwinkel (Ger). Both players were extremely popular upon entering the court. In the first set, Krahwinkel’s skills were excellent, winning 6-3. In the first game of the second set, Krahwinkel also won, but Vines unleashed his special skill, using cannonball serves to subdue his opponent. Although Krahwinkel had excellent shots that delighted the spectators, he ultimately could not win. Vines won the second set 6-3. In the third set, both sides seemed tired, and the momentum of the ball was no longer as quick as before. Krahwinkel was sometimes able to put his opponent in a difficult position, but Vines rallied and won the third set 9-7. After a break, the battle resumed, and Vines clearly had the advantage, winning 6-3 and defeating Germany.</p>
<p>Von Cramm Greatly Defeats Shields</p>
<p>Paris, 24th (Havas) – The last match between the US and Germany was Shields (US) against Von Cramm (Ger). Shields' skills were rusty, just like on the first day of the match, while Von Cramm was impeccable. Before long, he was able to control his opponent, winning the first set 6-1. In the second set, Von Cramm won again 6-0. Shields was completely flustered, unable to return even the easiest of shots. However, in the third set, Shields rallied and won 8-6. After a break, the battle resumed, and Von Cramm's skills were still extremely skilled, winning the fourth set 6-2 and defeating Shields. Looking back to when the US and Germany met in 1929, Germany was completely defeated 0-5. Although they failed this time, the score was still 2-3, which is a significant improvement compared to three years ago.</p>
<p>The German Duo Is Truly Formidable</p>
<p>Paris, 24th (Reuters) – In the Davis Cup Europe-America inter-zonal final, the US defeated Germany 3-2 this afternoon, and will compete against France in the challenge final starting on the 29th.</p>
<p>Vines defeated Krahwinkel with scores of 3-6, 6-3, 9-7, and 6-3, deciding the victory. Vines’ victory was entirely due to his powerful smashes, heavy spins, and serves. However, Krahwinkel's positioning, placement, and returns were all magnificent and steady. Krahwinkel only double-faulted twice in the entire match, while Vines double-faulted as many as nine times.</p>
<p>Von Cramm defeated Shields 6-1, 6-0, 6-8, 6-2. The match was unusually dull, and the disparity in skill was too great.</p>
<p>France Announces Full Team Lineup</p>
<p>Paris, 24th (Havas) – After the match between the US and Germany, the Technical Committee of the French Tennis Association met to finalize the French team participating in the Davis Cup. The committee then issued the following announcement: "The chairman of this committee, in light of Lacoste's sudden illness and inability to represent France in the Davis Cup challenge round, feels compelled to rely on Borotra. He has earnestly persuaded Borotra to sacrifice his spirit and remain loyal to the French tennis team by rescinding his decision to no longer play singles matches. Borotra, who always loves discipline, has fully and unreservedly agreed to this request, stating that the committee should appoint a young player if possible. As such, this association has finalized the organization of the French team, which includes Borotra, Brugnon, Boussus, and Cochet. The captain is Gillou."</p>

<p>Enthusiastic Participants in Summer Football</p>
<p>Registration Will Close at the End of the Month</p>
<p>At this time of oppressive heat, the football sport, which is most popular and well-loved by Shanghai residents, is quiet and unknown, and there is a saying that it is not suitable for the season. However, if we continue to adhere to the established rules, it would be like abandoning food because of choking, making it impossible for football skills to advance. The National Sports Advancement Association, in view of this, has created the innovation of shortening the game time for both the summer and inter-business competitions, with good intentions. In addition, the enthusiastic Mr. Dong Zhenyuan and the Taiping Company have produced and donated two large silver cups as trophies for the two competitions to encourage participation. Since registration began on the 18th of this month, the Qinghua, Xingguang, Yuqing (changed from Xuhui), Lingnan, Huadong Company, Zhihua, Yuequn, and Qiangnan teams have participated in the summer league, and the Taiping Insurance Company, Zhonghua Bookstore, Postal Team, and Land Bureau teams have participated in the inter-business cup. However, there are many football teams in Shanghai, and there are certainly many companies and firms that have entire teams. At that time, during leisure time after work, as the setting sun falls (games start after 5 PM), practicing skills on the green is truly unparalleled entertainment for physical fitness. Registration for the competition will close on the 31st of this month, so it is best to register as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Gold Price Drops 4.6 Taels</p>
<p>Swap Market Advance Bids at 1.9 Taels Yesterday, the gold price indeed continued to fall, with relatively smooth fluctuations. Throughout the day, the high and low prices varied by about five taels, eventually falling more than four taels. The buying and selling activities of various parties were uneven, and the sentiment among dealers was weak. Initially, the silver market reported a slight decrease due to price increases, but it became weaker due to large-scale selling. Although the foreign exchange market extended half a notch, the domestic market went from loose to flat. Buyers in the market were also active, and short sellers took advantage of this to advance, causing the price to rise by three or four taels. The market then dipped again, but the overall situation was mediocre, with the final price recorded at about 743 taels. The price for August delivery was once swapped at 1.9 taels, still with advance bids from the long side. The detailed conditions of the market before and after are recorded below.</p>
<p>Large Sellers Cause Gold Prices to Fall Further From the Early Opening of September</p>
<p>Delivery at 747.5 taels, slightly lower by 0.4 taels. Although the British and American silver markets each rose by one-eighth yesterday, it did not have a significant impact. Subsequently, Dahsingyong, Yuanheng, Hengyu, Yifungyong, Hengxing, Dadecheng, Xinchang, and Yuankangxiang successively sold aggressively. It was rumored that Mr. Wu Heng had to unload, and because the US dollar was becoming weaker, the July price was initially at 81.25, which HSBC and Banque de l'Indochine then sold to Zhejiang for 30 yuan. In addition, Mercury offered September British gold at 18.25, so the gold price continued to fall. Nearing 9:30, it suddenly dropped to 41.8 taels, but Tongtaichang quickly covered their short positions and then picked up 1.0 taels to 43 taels. British gold opened with a high bid of 1.125, and the US dollar was the same. When it retreated to 42.2 taels, news suddenly came that Citibank was buying, with July US dollars at 93.75. Banque de l'Indochine also bought, and because Tongtaichang's buying momentum was strong, Hengyu, Yifungyong, and Yuanxingyong and Fuyu reversed and bought in, adding another 2 taels to the price, reaching 45 taels at around 10:20. However, there was fluctuation within a few cents in half an hour. Later, Zhifengyong, Dadecheng, Fuyu, and Zhaofengchang sold, so August British gold was paired at 0.25, down more than 1 tael. At 11:00, it was 43.3 taels, and it immediately turned upward, because Mercury was absorbing July US dollars at 93.75, and October was paired at 30.01875 yuan. There were also many buyers on the floor. Hengxing, Tongtaichang, Hongkangyong, Yuantai, Zhaofengchang, Chengdayong, Yuanmaoyong and others were all buying in. HSBC also absorbed July US dollars at 93.75, so sentiment was upward, and the price was pulled up 2.67 taels. From 11:10 to 11:40, there were slight price fluctuations, and at 11:50, it was 46 taels. Then, general small-scale long positions took advantage of the opportunity to profit and immediately sold, so the noon closing was 45.1 taels.</p>
<p>The Market After Lunch Was Mediocre and Dipped Again The market opened after lunch at only 44.1 taels, because goods opened small, and there were retail sellers. It then added another 0.5 to 0.6 taels, with Hengyu buying in, reaching 45.1 taels. Later, there seemed to be more sellers, such as Shunli, Longsheng, and Hengxing, but the quantities were not large. Buyers included Yuanxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Hongkangyong, and Yuantai. The foreign exchange market was flat, and there was some selling in the industry, with Citibank selling at 93.75 this month. By 3:00, it was 43.8 taels, and suddenly it rose by more than 1 tael, because Mercury was absorbing November Citibank at 3.125, and Yifungyong and Zhifengyong bought in, so it rose to 45.3 taels. Then, due to arbitrage and Yuanchun and others selling, and outside sellers, the price gradually turned downward. By the 4:00 closing, it was 43.3 taels, down another 4.6 taels from last week. Unexpectedly, Ruikang suddenly bought in, and the price was raised by 0.6 to 0.7 taels, about 4 taels in total. The maximum for the day was 747.5 taels, and the minimum was 741.8 taels, a difference of 5.7 taels. The bare interest rate still increased by 9.5 taels.</p>
<p>Price Suppression Pressed Down by 1 Tael</p>
<p>The price suppression was changed to 817 taels, because the US dollar was quoted at 1.125, calculated to suppress 74 taels to 72 taels, 72 to 73 taels in the afternoon, and later 74 taels, more than 1 tael more than the end of last week. The registered prices were 48 taels for August, 45 taels for September, 45 taels for the water supplement, and 43 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Floor Trading Not Weak</p>
<p>Statistics Tongtaichang, Yifungyong, Yuantai, Yuhe, Yuanxingyong, Hengxingyuan, Hengchangyong, and Yuanmaoyong all bought in. Shunli, Wanxing, and Hengyu bought more than they sold. Yuanheng, Dahsingyong, Zhifengyong, Yuankangxiang, Futaiheng, and Dadecheng all sold. Hongkangyong, Zhaofengchang, Fuyu, Longsheng, and arbitrageurs bought and sold intermittently. Hengxing bought in one hundred and dozens of bars and sold about four hundred bars. In the afternoon, Hengyu, Hongkangyong, Zhifengyong, Ruikang, Yuantai, Yuanmaoyong, Yifungyong, Yuanxingyong, and Qianchangxiang all bought in. Shunli, Wanxing, Yuhe, Hengxing, Dadecheng, and Futaiheng bought and sold frequently. Fushun, Chunyongyuan, and arbitrageurs all sold. Hengxing bought and sold more than one hundred bars. On that day, the Ningbo gang bought in a total of four to five hundred bars and sold more than three hundred bars. The Cantonese gang sold more than four hundred bars and bought more than two hundred bars. It was also said that the speculator Mr. Wu had sold in the morning session.</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Market Was Flat for British Currency and Loose for US Currency</p>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and there was no news from the silver market. HSBC's posted rates in Shanghai extended half a notch, with British gold at 1.125, which was 1 shilling, 7 pence, and 0.875 farthings, and US dollars extended 1.125, which was 29 yuan and 0.375. Indian exchange also increased by 0.075, French francs increased by 5 yuan, German exchange rose by 1 yuan, Japanese yen increased by 0.075, Singapore dollars decreased by 0.075, and Hong Kong dollars remained unchanged. As for the domestic market, it was loose and then flat, with the gold price continuing to fall by more than 4 taels, and the fluctuations of the day totaling more than 5 taels, causing the foreign exchange market to also rotate slightly. The result was that British gold was flat compared to last Saturday, and US dollars extended by 1.125. Trading among Chinese merchants was not weak, with British gold at about 100,000 pounds, mostly between banks, and US dollars at about 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, with each firm initially buying and then selling. Citibank and Mobil Oil were both buying in the near term. The transaction prices of each bank are recorded below.</p>
<p>British Exchange The domestic market did not exceed 0.0625 difference throughout the day. In the morning, the selling price was 1 shilling, 8 pence, and 0.125 to 0.25 farthings, and the buying price was 0.875 to 0.3125, with advantageous pairing with Yokohama Specie Bank for September at 1.875. Yokohama Specie Bank paired with HSBC for November at 3.125. Mercury offered September at 0.25, and Andali paired favorably for August at 0.25. The noon closing was flat.

<p>The Interest Rate Was Stable with More Frequent Transactions</p>
<p>The Market Was Quiet and Closed Early Yesterday's silver dollar situation showed that trading in the discount ticket market was slightly more frequent than usual, while transactions in foreign currency were still the same as usual, with no particular busyness. However, buying and selling by banks was slightly more than on the opening day of the port, and all kinds of settlements were combined for two days, so the procedures were naturally more busy, especially for foreign banks. As the price competition was less intense, the market gathering time was a quarter of an hour earlier than usual.</p>

<p>Bond Prices Slightly Lower by 8 to 9 Corners</p>
<p>Trading Approximately 5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th), the situation in the various bond markets of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was that spot transactions totaled 23,000 yuan, including 15,000 yuan in 20th-year bonds, several thousand yuan in customs duties of 1919, and no other market. The futures market was still active, and the market atmosphere was lively, with transactions between the two sessions totaling 4,965,000 yuan, including 1,050,000 yuan in salt taxes, 820,000 yuan in 20th-year customs duties, more than 700,000 yuan in consolidated taxes, and approximately 500,000 yuan each in disarmament, 1919 customs duties, charitable contributions, and 20th-year bonds. The overall situation of the six customs duties and the 96 customs duties remained unchanged. As for the changes in the prices of various bonds, due to the lack of any turnaround in the diplomatic situation and the increasingly bleak situation in the Northeast, the prospects were truly dismal. Retail investors tended to sell, and the market was weak. As supply exceeded demand, various prices fell again, but the trend was still peaceful, with each price gradually decreasing and no major rise or fall. As a result, prices were lower by 5 to 6 corners to more than 1 yuan compared to last week, with only spot goods such as 20th-year customs duties and 1919 customs duties rising slightly.</p>

<p>New York Stock Market Stable</p>
<p>(Report from American Eastern Bank)</p>
<p>The New York stock market remained stable on Saturday. Although it was the end of the week, many profit-takers sold, but the market did not decline, proving that the rise in the stock market last week had strong momentum and was not easily shaken. The economic news on Saturday was still good, and the public bond market was also good. However, due to time constraints, the stock market (only had half a day of trading) did not have a good impact. However, judging from Saturday's situation, it can be concluded that the future stock market is still very promising. Attached are the Dow Jones indices as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e95">Yarn Flowers <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Recently, yarn prices have surged by two or three taels.</p>
<p>Yarn sales are booming... Chinese factories' remaining stock has been completely bought up.</p>
<p>The actual demand for cotton yarn is increasingly developing. Merchants from Hunan and Guangdong continue to purchase incessantly, and current yarn supplies have been bought out. They are now purchasing futures with delivery dates of eight, nine, or thirteen months, with increasingly larger quantities. People's sentiment is extremely excited, and the market is steadily rising. The reason for this is that this year, the Yangtze River basin has had consistent rainfall, resulting in a bountiful harvest. Therefore, many operators are preparing for potential future needs by purchasing in large quantities, creating a sudden and vibrant market. This month, only one factory is delivering contract yarn, and all the chips have been taken by buyers. General short sellers, seeing the good spot sales, are even more panicked. The market has surged by three taels and three qian. However, the global cotton industry is still sluggish, while domestic demand in the South is booming. This time, Chinese factories' remaining stock has been completely sold out, which is a good sign for our country's textile industry.</p>
<p>Contract prices rise, especially for this month's futures. The contract market opened with robust spot yarn trading. Merchants from the Yangtze River region also began purchasing, boosting confidence. There was a lack of sellers in the market, and short sellers covered their positions. This month's futures rose by two taels, while distant futures rose by five or six qian. Customers continued to purchase actively in the second and third sessions, tightening the market further, and prices rose another three or six qian. In the end, prices for all months rose by one to three taels and three qian. In the afternoon, the market remained closed due to the heat. A total of 40,150 bales of contract yarn were traded. Yi Yu sold 1,000 bales, Xie Sheng 1,000 bales, Da Chang 450 bales, Yi Chang 800 bales, Shen Chang 550 bales, and Da Ji 600 bales. Da Yi purchased 1,050 bales, Chang Feng 1,100 bales, Yi Cheng 700 bales, Yuan Tai 550 bales, Heng Yi 800 bales, and Tian Long 550 bales. The closing prices for contract yarn are listed below.</p>
<p>Contract Yarn Closing Prices Rise/Fall Inventory</p>
<p>July 15.23 +3.3 895,050 October 15.14 +1.2 844,500</p>
<p>August 15.23 +1.9 363,000 November 15.13 +1.2 867,000</p>
<p>September 15.17 +1.3 632,000 December 15.12 +1.0 571,000</p>
<p>Total 3,368,000</p>
<p>Spot yarn: Merchants from the Yangtze River region also start buying. Spot yarn sales</p>
<p>remain active. There is much activity in the Yangtze River region, while sales in the southern ports are slightly sluggish. A total of 4,700 bales were purchased by various merchants throughout the day, with prices rising by 5 qian to 1.5 taels. The quantities purchased by each region are listed below:</p>
<p>Yangtze River 3,500 Shantou 250 Luzhou 20 Datong 125</p>
<p>Guangdong 685 Anqing 30 Sichuan 60 Northern Merchants 20 Wuhu 145</p>
<p>Inland 155 Total 4,700 bales</p>
<p>The cotton market is increasingly strong.</p>
<p>The cotton market is firm. U.S. cotton is very weak, and exchange rates are also lackluster. However, the situation for local cotton is that inventories are too low, and the yarn market is rising, pulling up raw cotton prices. Demand for spot cotton in the market is relatively active from various factories. With the improvement in yarn sales, factories are slightly more willing to purchase. As for the July contract cotton, the chips for delivery are scarce, making the situation even stronger. It is rumored that a certain factory is buying up supply, affecting the distant futures market.</p>
<p>Zheng contract prices fall initially, then rise. The Zheng contract market opened with falling U.S. cotton prices, causing short sellers to dump their positions. The yarn market was trending upward, boosting market sentiment. In the end, prices for all months rose by 5 fen to 3 qian. A total of 66,500 dan were traded. Yuan Da sold 7,900 dan, Heng Feng 3,100 dan, Yi Yu 1,800 dan, Yuan Da 2,500 dan, Chang He 1,500 dan, and Xie Sheng 1,300 dan. Da Yi purchased 2,000 dan, Rui Da 2,900 dan, Shen Chang 1,900 dan, Tai Sheng Kang 1,100 dan, Tong Fu 1,100 dan, Da Feng 1,200 dan, and Sen Kang 1,300 dan. The closing prices for Zheng contract cotton are listed below.</p>
<p>Zheng Contract Closing Prices Rise/Fall Inventory</p>
<p>November 31.65 +0.1 994,000</p>

<p>October 31.60 +0.1 690,000</p>
<p>Raw cotton: Factories are very willing to purchase; Spot cotton consumption is greatly stimulated.</p>
<p>With the improvement in yarn sales, factories are purchasing actively. The source of cotton is Yao cotton, totaling 308 bales. The spot cotton sales are listed below:</p>

<p>Huo Ji Cotton 29.50 Tong Yi Factory Purchased 200 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Last week, spot sales of Indian and English cotton were not weak.</p>
<p>Bombay: The market was not very active last week. Although foreign markets fell, this country, due to firm prices, favorable weather, and increased demand for yarn and cloth, as well as brisk spot sales, people are not paying attention to current selling. On the spot side, local factories continue to buy, and Japanese merchants also bought in. European exporters have not been active. The attached statistics for last week are as follows (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<p>1931 1932</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1 5,543 1,977</p>
<p>Weekend stock 786 805</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1 2,292 87</p>
<p>Exports to Europe 575 156</p>
<p>Exports to China 407 205</p>
<p>Exports to Japan 1,287 499</p>
<p>Other regions 25 7</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot transactions were quite good last week. Futures trading was hindered by reports of good weather and reduced pests for US cotton, as well as smooth cotton harvesting. However, several reports of poor flowering and boll shedding kept market sentiment relatively good. Egyptian cotton market was good due to the cessation of Indian arbitrage and active demand for fine cotton.</p>

<p>Rice market situation is stabilized.</p>
<p>Hu Nan: Yesterday, about ten ships arrived from various groups, and the stock in Pu was meager. The sales in the urban and rural stores are due to the thinness of the bottom and the scarcity of the arrival day by day. Also, the price of foreign rice is slightly firmer, and the transaction is slightly less than before. The thick japonica market is very hard and the secondary is stable. Early and late rice and foreign lu jian are neither prosperous nor disgraced. The yin hua wine houses' rice sales moved slightly. The opening price decreased by one or two jiao. Bian yuan is lacking in goods and has no market.</p>
<p>News: The source in the west road is limited, and the digestion in this city is first active and then dull. The whole city has slight ups and downs. Changshu Beigeng is topped. The purchase of early and late rice such as Qingjiao, Chonggu and Jiashan is not weak, and the price is also increased. The arrival and sales of Lubu Jian are both small, and the market is solid. The yin bian yuan goods are rare and the consumption is continuously strong.</p>
<p>Small polished rice suddenly rises by three or four jiao.</p>
<p>Yong merchants actively purchase small polished rice.</p>
<p>Jin merchants continue to load Saigon rice.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice was great. Because the Ningbo merchants continued to purchase actively, there were new Tianjin merchants and Wuxi Nanjing Zhenjiang Jiangbei roads to purchase. The local streets in the mainland also inquired. It is estimated that more than 20,000 bags were opened. The market still has the intention to continue to load, so the people are very good and the price has also risen by three or four corners. The high-priced small polished rice has opened to nine yuan and six jiao, the market price is nine yuan, four jiao, three cents to two jiao, seven cents. Chen Xiao Jiao Da to nine yuan and two jiao and a half to two jiao. Low-quality goods have also broken out of the nine yuan mark. A total of 19,000 bags of small polished rice were opened. In addition to the 4,000 bags of old rice and 1,000 bags of new rice from Ningbo, the rest were taken away by various gangs. The price of Saigon is from ten yuan, one jiao to four jiao, and 2,500 bags were traded, of which 500 bags were taken away by Tianjin merchants, most of which were taken by the streets. Big polished rice has not been opened for a long time. Yesterday, 2,500 bags were removed by Yong merchants at a price of eight yuan and four jiao and a half. In addition to the foreign rice purchased in this street, 300 bags of Wenzhou brown rice were also purchased at a price of seven yuan, seven jiao and six cents, and 101 bags of Jiangxi machine yuan rice were purchased at a price of thirteen yuan and one jiao.</p>
<p>Wheat futures are slightly firmer.</p>
<p>This month's short squeeze has become a bubble.</p>
<p>The wheat market this day, after the opening in the morning, presented a situation of flat and distant firmness. Although there was a short squeeze in the current month, the number of bulls and bears is equal at the moment. Those who receive the goods are about 30 trucks, and those recognized as qualified by the exchange have 30 trucks, so it is no longer a problem. In addition, there are more than 20 trucks of bulls and bears, all of which are aimless and naturally settled, resulting in a quiet situation. For the distant months, due to the slightly better quotation of foreign wheat, and the increase in the flour market, people's minds are slightly brought up, but there are also many customers involved, so the increase is not much. As a result, this month is one point smaller than the previous week, August to October are two points better, and November is one point better. The spot wheat market, with the trend of standard flour wheat becoming more popular, high-quality goods are also shouting for two or three points higher. Kaishatou wheat is two taels and three cents, Zhizhang wheat is three taels, Shuangfeng wheat is two taels, nine qian, six or seven cents, Guandian wheat is two taels and nine qian, Wusong wheat is two taels and eight qian, two cents, Chongming wheat is two taels and eight qian, half, Taicang wheat is two taels, nine qian, seven cents, and the second is two taels and nine qian, Lujiabang wheat is two taels, nine qian, one cent, a total of 2,500 bags.</p>
<p>After the Tianjin merchants actively purchase,</p>
<p>The standard flour presents a vigorous and rapid rise.</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, presented a vigorous and rapid rise in each month. Because of the market sentiment, after the Tianjin merchants gradually loaded the flour, the soft hearted people were moved. Although the large factories have a thick foundation, it is difficult to issue documents, so they can only stick to it. The general speculative floating is more, seeing the factory throwing the suspension, the opportunity is relatively good, so the courage to buy is very enthusiastic, and the floating air is afraid of being squeezed, and it is also very strong to make up. Therefore, the market is very smooth and the buyers are very prosperous. The distant future is even more absorbed by most households, so it forms a tight situation. If you look at the environment, it seems that the increase is still not based on. As a result, July to October each rose by two points, November rose by one and a half points, and December rose by two points.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Dried and Preserved Goods <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of new Lan bamboo branches has arrived.</p>
<p>Opening at twenty-seven taels and six qian.</p>
<p>The first batch of new Lan bamboo branches produced in Zhangzhou arrived a few days ago in dozens of boxes. Only ten boxes of goods are available here, and the rest are transferred to other ports. The samples were quite good yesterday, not only were the colors bright, but the individuals were also pure and large. It was immediately priced at 27 taels and 6 qian. However, the second batch of 200 boxes was also transported to Jinan by wheel yesterday, including Lan bamboo, black leaves, and early red. It is estimated that it will also open today, or it may be slightly looser.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Sugar Market <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Coarse sand and white marked market turns better.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public market drawing trade was quite lively. The transaction price of No. 24 coarse sand white of Dutch sugar was fourteen taels and four qian, and the outgoing goods were particularly lacking, and the market was very good. No. 8 and 9 Dutch red are ten taels and six qian, and raw sand red is shouted up to twelve taels and four qian. The market is flat. Taikoo Sugar B Mark is sixteen taels and three qian, CW Mark is fifteen taels and eight qian, DY Mark is fifteen taels, four qian and seven and a half cents, H Mark is twelve taels and six qian, and PX Mark is eleven taels and two qian. There were not many transactions, and the market was stable. There are auspicious No. 8 Dutch red 500 bags opened by the Haopan, and the price is 10 taels and 4 cents. The intention of the line is not smooth, so the market still has a stable trace.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Silk and Tea <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The tea market is booming.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of foreign tea companies in this port, the British and American companies purchased green tea, such as Lu Zhuang Tu Zhuang Pingshui, and the transactions were very prosperous. A big gang, the transaction reached more than 3,600 boxes. Zhen Mei, Zhen Mei, Xiu Mei and other colors also had more than 2,200 boxes of transactions. The market has a gradual development. Therefore, the attitude of Chinese tea merchants is very stable. The market has not changed from the previous day, but the market for Keemun black tea has turned quiet.</p>
<p>Piece goods: The sales of woolen fabrics depend only on Sichuan merchants.</p>
<p>Due to the hot weather, there were no new purchases from this street for woolen fabrics, only the hat workshop had a little bit of embellishment, but most of them were written tickets and not paid in cash. Yesterday, customers purchased considerable autumn and winter wool goods, such as camel hair, melton plain thick cloth, suits, straight tribute Hua Te cloth, etc. The Sichuan merchants were the most active. The northern merchants were affected by the situation in the northeast, and the commercial decline in the Yangtze River was bleak. The southern ports mostly went to Hong Kong for distribution, so the demand was sluggish. Even if there were purchasers, only colored goods had a little appetite.</p>
<p>Coal: Kailuan coal sales suddenly improve.</p>
<p>Since the news of the Japanese army's attack on Rehe spread to Shanghai, the Kailuan coal market suddenly improved. The fellow merchants in this port assumed that if Rehe went to war, the Guans would be tense. Qinhuangdao, which is the hub of coal transportation, would inevitably be difficult to transport in the future, and the source may be interrupted. Therefore, ordinary merchants have been buying each other in recent days. The total transaction of the two days before yesterday was more than 3,500 tons. The selling price is therefore very tight. It is estimated that Kailuan block is eight taels and five qian, No. 1 layer is eight taels and three qian, and No. 2 layer is eight taels.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Principle for Abolishing the Tael and Replacing it with the Yuan is Set <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Research Association to Meet Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Banks and Qian Shops Express Agreement</p>
<p>Hu Mengjia and Yu Zuoting Appointed as Representatives</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan, since Finance Minister Song Ziwen came to Shanghai and continued discussions with representatives from the local Chinese and foreign banking communities, significant progress has been made. In addition to drafting three principles, a research committee will be jointly established by the government and Chinese and foreign banking communities. It is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow afternoon at 3:00 PM with the representatives appointed by the silver and money industries yesterday to formally study the three principles. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Three Principles Decided: After arriving in Shanghai last Friday, Song invited banking representatives Bei Songsun, Li Fusun, and foreign banking representatives, totaling several individuals, to his residence at 4:30 PM the following afternoon to continue discussions based on previous progress. Considering the importance of the matter and its complex nature, it was agreed that a thorough discussion was necessary. Therefore, three principles to be discussed were determined: (1) The weight, fineness, and legal tender value of the new silver coin; (2) How to regulate the exchange rate between silver contracts still in effect and silver coins; (3) What methods should be adopted to ensure that the general public understands and trusts this change. It is said that after the above three principles were decided, they were handed over to the research association for abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan for discussion.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Research Association: In addition to drafting the above three principles, a research association will be jointly established by the government, Chinese and foreign banking communities, and experts. On the government side, Chen Jianan, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, will be the chairman. Bei Songsun, General Manager of the Bank of China; Hu Bijiang, General Manager of the China &amp; South Sea Bank; Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Enterprise Bank; and six individuals representing the Western side, including bank representatives and experts Kam, Mazot, and Lynch, will be committee members.</p>
<p>Meeting Scheduled for Tomorrow: After the establishment of the research committee, the first meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow (Wednesday) at 3:00 PM at the Central Bank. In addition to the participation of Chinese and Western committee members, representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Silver and Money Trade Associations will also be invited. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appointed Ma Jiliang, the banking industry has appointed Hu Mengjia, and the money industry has appointed Yu Zuoting to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Collects Opinions from Various Industries</p>
<p>Regarding the progress of abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan, and its future attitude, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce officially released the following information yesterday through its secretary, Yan E'sheng:</p>
<p>Resolution of the Delegates' Congress: At the meeting of the Third Members' Representative Congress of the Chamber of Commerce, Cai Runsen, the representative of the Fruit and Local Goods Industry, proposed, and Lu Wenshao, the representative of the Rice Trade, and Chen Wenming, the representative of the Medicinal Materials Industry, seconded, a motion urging the government to unify the currency system, abolish the tael and replace it with the yuan as soon as possible, in order to stabilize the financial foundation and benefit commerce. The original text stated: "The government of the Third Year of the Republic (1914) proposed a unified currency system, but it has not been implemented after many years. The reason for the failure to implement it immediately lies in the fact that politics are not on the right track, and provinces govern themselves, resulting in disparate currency systems. The people therefore suffer from this lack of uniformity. The same amount of money, when transferred from Province A to Province B, loses a certain amount in transit. The recent Shanghai war is an example, where the difference in the price of "li" (a small unit of currency) can be as high as five cents per yuan, the harm of which is imaginable. Therefore, we ask the Congress to discuss this matter, which we hope will be realized." After discussion by the Congress, it was resolved to hand over the matter to the Executive Committee to convene the two trade associations of banks and money shops to carefully formulate measures to be submitted to the government for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>Collecting Opinions from the Two Industries: After the Second Executive Committee was established, the case was brought up for discussion at the first meeting. It was then resolved that, due to the importance of the matter, opinions from the two guilds of silver shops and money shops should be solicited before further processing. Letters were sent to the two guilds on July 2nd. As of yesterday, a reply had been received from the Money Shop Guild, but the Banking Guild had not yet replied as it had just raised the matter for discussion yesterday.</p>
<p>Reply from the Money Shop Guild: The Money Shop Guild's reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated: "To the esteemed Chamber, abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan is one step in reforming the currency system. All Chinese people are happy to see its success. However, this matter is of great importance and requires thorough planning. It is absolutely impossible to proceed with a one-sided mindset. Rather than rushing into things, it may lead to many problems. The benefits may not be seen, but the harm will appear first, causing endless pain to the livelihoods of the people and the national economy. For the sake of caution, our association has prepared humble suggestions and telegraphed them to the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation. The text of the telegram has already been disclosed in various newspapers and should be available for inspection. We will not repeat it here. Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Chen Jianan of the Central Bank, stating that he had received instructions from the Ministry to organize a committee to study the matter in the long term and to propose three points to be studied. He instructed our association to express our views in writing or by appointing a representative. In addition to appointing a representative to attend the preliminary discussions, we have repeatedly discussed the three points to be studied and sent a detailed reply to Mr. Chen for reference. We believe that this matter is important and is not only related to the silver and money industries, nor is it only related to Shanghai. All industries in the country are closely related to it. Opinions should be collected from all industries first in order to be thorough and avoid obstacles. Your Chamber is the highest commercial organization, and the members are all well-known figures of the time. You must have accurate insights and comprehensive planning on this issue in order to unify the currency system and stabilize society. We are sending a copy of the correspondence with Mr. Chen for your perusal and careful consideration. We look forward to your insights and a unified currency system and the peace of society depend on it."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Opinion: When the Chamber of Commerce held its third executive committee meeting yesterday, this issue was raised for discussion. The committee members present included Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Bei Songsun, Yu Zuoting, Luo Qinghua, Lu Wenshao, Ma Jiliang, Chen Zheqing, Fang Jiaobo, Ye Jiaxing, Lao Jingxiu, and Zhu Wenqi. Chairman Wang Xiaolai expressed his opinion that the principle of abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan had been passed by the Delegates' Congress and there was no room for discussion. However, detailed discussion of the preparatory measures before and the handling methods after the event was necessary. This matter is by no means just a matter for the silver and money industries, but is related to all industries and the entire society. The issue of grain should be discussed from the standpoint of the people's livelihood and should not be based on the interests of rice shops or restaurants. Currently, various parties have expressed opinions on this issue. I propose that the Chamber of Commerce should wait for the various industries to express their opinions, then summarize them and propose concrete measures.</p>
<p>Appointment of Attending Representative: At the fourth standing committee meeting, the committee had appointed Wang Yansong as the representative to attend the discussion of this issue. Yesterday, Wang stated that he had to go to Qingdao soon to investigate industries and was unable to attend, and requested that another representative be appointed. The executive committee meeting changed the appointment to Ma Jiliang as the attending representative. The Chamber of Commerce then sent a letter to Chen Jianan, President of the Central Bank, to inform him of this change.</p>
<p>Another Research Committee to be Formed: The Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter is of great importance and that it is necessary to solicit opinions from various industries on the three issues inquired about in the letter from Chen Jianan of the Central Bank. It was resolved to send a circular to solicit opinions, and if there are any other opinions besides the three issues, please express them as much as possible. On one hand, the Chamber of Commerce will organize a research committee with seven members. The executive committee has appointed Zhu Wenqi, Fang Jiaobo, Ma Jiliang, Luo Qinghua, Lu Wenshao, Chen Zheqing, and Yi Yunqing as members, and designated Zhu Wenqi as the convener.</p>
<p>Meeting of the Banking Trade Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Trade Association held an executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the meeting hall at No. 4 Hong Kong Road to discuss the issue of abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan. Representatives from various banks were sent to attend the discussion. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>List of Committee Members and Representatives Present: The list of all executive committee members and representatives of various banks is as follows: Li Fusun, Xu Jiqing, Tan Weiwen, Wu Weiru (represented by Wang Zihou), Chen Zheqing, Hu Bijiang, Wu Yunqi (represented by Li Zuji), Tang Baoshu, Xu Boming, Wang Tianshen, Jin Songsheng, Yao Dexin, Liu Hongyuan, Hu Mengjia, Yang Oufu, Xu Xinliu, Xu Weigan, Hu Xiqian, Ye Fuxiao, Bei Songsun, Wang Zhixin, Yu Yuanhui, Wang Boyuan, Xu Baoying, Li Shuxiong, Jing Runshi, and over forty others. Discussion of Various Proposals: Chairman Li Fusun reported on the three principles set by the research association for abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan. The committee members and bank representatives then discussed the matter until the meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. The result was that they all agreed that it was feasible to implement it, and Hu Mengjia was appointed as a representative to participate in the research association for abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan.</p>
<p>Money Shops Propose Research Opinions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Shop Trade Association specially convened an executive committee meeting to appoint representatives to express their opinions. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting of the Money Shop Executive Committee: The Money Shop Trade Association held an executive committee meeting at its clubhouse on Ningbo Road the day before yesterday at 2:00 PM. All committee members, including Qin Runqing, Yu Zuoting, Fu Songnian, Pei Yunqing, Hu Xisheng, and Xie Taofu, were present. Chairman Qin Runqing presided over the meeting, and everyone expressed their views on the issue of abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan. It was decided to appoint standing committee member Yu Zuoting as the representative to attend the meeting of the research association for abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan convened by the Ministry of Finance. After repeated discussion, the three points for which the research committee was seeking opinions were decided upon, and a letter was sent to the research association to submit them.</p>
<p>Money Shop Research Opinions: The Money Shop Trade Association replied to Chen Jianan, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, yesterday: "Respected Mr. Jianan, regarding the issue of abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan, we recently received a letter stating that you were instructed by the Ministry to organize a committee to study the matter in the long term and to propose three points to be studied. You instructed our association to express our views in writing or by appointing a representative to attend the meeting. We have already appointed standing committee member Yu Zuoting as our representative and sent a reply. Now, our association has repeatedly discussed the three points to be studied and proposed the following opinions: (1) The weight and fineness of the new silver coins should, at a minimum, follow the currency system regulations of the Third Year of the Republic (1914) and be actually minted. It is especially necessary to convene various trade groups to form a committee to supervise or assay the coins and publish announcements in newspapers to demonstrate trustworthiness. (2) The conversion of silver taels to silver yuan is not only related to the silver and money industries, nor is it only related to Shanghai. All industries in the country that have creditor-debtor relationships are related. To weigh things fairly, the chambers of commerce in various places should be responsible for convening various industries to discuss and determine them impartially, so as to avoid excessive or insufficient weights and cause obstacles to implementation. (3) To ensure that the general public does not doubt the changes, a unified issuance should be carried out, with a special bureau set up. The reserve fund should be at least 60% in cash, according to law, and should not be offset by other business funds. It is especially necessary to allow various trade groups to have the right to inspect at any time in accordance with the principle of openness, so that the people of the country will not have any doubts and foreigners will have no reason to interfere. This is the most important key to the livelihood of the people and the national economy, and should be given extra attention. The above opinions are for the purpose of reforming the currency system and seeking comprehensive measures, without any bias. The committee members are all well-known figures of the time with rich experience, and there is no need for our association to worry too much. However, since it concerns the national economy and the people's livelihood, we must express our views for contribution. We hope that you will consider them carefully."</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Cables Opinions</p>
<p>Leaders from various circles, such as Yu Hede (Yu Qiaqing), have initiated the organization of an economic discussion group to study the pros and cons of abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan. It will be formally established in the shortest possible time. Yu believes that abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan has a great impact on various industries and that extra caution should be taken beforehand to avoid future troubles. Yesterday, Yu sent telegrams to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, and Chairman Jiang, stating his opinions. The original telegram to Chairman Jiang is recorded below (the rest are roughly the same, so they are omitted):</p>
<p>Respected Chairman Jiang, I believe that the disorder of currency in our country and its rectification and improvement are indeed important plans. Observing the psychology of all circles in Shanghai, there is unanimous support for the principle of abolishing the tael and replacing it with the yuan. I earnestly hope that it will be realized. However, many people advocate that before implementation, a thorough plan for rectification must be made in order to seek a thorough reform. After the change of the yuan, how should the fineness of the standard currency be determined? How should the old silver coins be disposed of? How should the conversion price between the two yuan be determined? How should the national right of issuance be centralized? And how should the issuance system be improved? All of these must have precise arrangements. Doing it piecemeal will only disturb the market and will not help in practice. Especially since Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together and the relationship between creditor and debtor is important, it is even more important to be cautious beforehand. Otherwise, not only will disputes increase, but it will also be chasing after trouble. The consequences are unimaginable. Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. If we only know the cumbersomeness of silver taels without investigating the complexities of silver yuan, and if we only know that silver yuan should be abolished without seeking to reform silver yuan, if we rush forward to achieve success and hastily accomplish things, the results may be unspeakable. Moreover, since the January 28th Incident (1932), Shanghai has been scarred, the market is depressed, unemployment is rampant, and labor unrest is frequent. Without rest and without preparation for this matter, it is reckless to issue an order to abolish the tael and replace it with the yuan. It will inevitably lead to the proliferation of paper money and inferior coins, and the quarrel between creditors and debtors. In the event of a financial turmoil, social instability will be even more dangerous. Jiangsu and Zhejiang are the hometowns of your Excellency, and Shanghai is where the national wealth lies. Moreover, at a time when the work of suppressing the Communists is intense, the security of the rear is important. If there is an incident, the great plan of suppressing the Communists will be abandoned at once, and the collapse of the national economy will follow. I have been in Shanghai for fifty years and have close relationships with all walks of life. What I consider dangerous, I dare not remain silent. I humbly offer my foolishness, and I implore you to consult with the competent authorities and seriously consider this issue. Before there is a thorough solution, do not act rashly, so as to preserve the country's original energy, and the various industries and the country will be fortunate. Yu Hede bows.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Northeast <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>After the Postal Blockade</p>
<p>Universal Postal Union Has Notified All Countries</p>
<p>After our country resolutely blocked the postal service in the East Province, the postal authorities reported the details to the Universal Postal Union. It is now known that the relevant documents have arrived and have been forwarded by the bureau to various countries. Yesterday, Huang Shaoxiong, the acting Minister of Communications, also issued a declaration (see the important telegram column). Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Universal Postal Union Notifies All Countries: Our authorities' resolute blockade of postal services in the East Province was forced by the various oppressions of the Japanese. Therefore, to clarify responsibility, our postal authorities telegraphed the Universal Postal Union in detail, describing the various disturbances caused by the Japanese instigating rebellion, our painstaking efforts to maintain this international postal artery, and the unbearable and unavoidable blockade. We also requested that the postal administrations of the member countries of the Postal Union be notified that from the date of our blockade of postal bureaus in the East Province, mail to Europe or the Americas will not be delivered via Siberia but will be rerouted via the Suez Canal or the Pacific Ocean, and that counterfeit stamps will not be recognized. The message, thousands of words long, was sent on the evening of the 22nd. According to Huang Naishu, Director General of Posts, the telegram has arrived at the secretariat of the Postal Union, and he has received a reply stating that the original telegram has been forwarded to all member countries of the Postal Union.</p>
<p>Ordinary Letters Also Stopped Being Sent Yesterday: The Ministry of Communications ordered the blockade of postal services in the three northeastern provinces on the 23rd. Therefore, starting from the 24th, the local postal bureau has stopped sending registered mail and remittances to the Northeast. Starting yesterday, ordinary letters have also been stopped.</p>
<p>Deputy Postal Director Liu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning: Liu Yaoting, Deputy Postal Director of the Liaoning District, left Shenyang and entered the pass before the blockade. Liu arrived in Beiping some time ago and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. He immediately met with Huang Naishu, Director General of Posts, to report on the situation of the Japanese oppression of postal services in the Northeast. Liu intends to work at the General Directorate, but is currently resting due to fatigue from the journey.</p>
<p>First Batch of Postal Workers Transferred Back Enters the Pass: After receiving the Ministry of Communications' order to block postal services in the Northeast, each postal bureau outside the pass began on the 24th. Ba Lidi, Postal Director of Liaoning District, and Smith, Postal Director of Jilin and Heilongjiang District, notified their staff to stop work and ordered all employees to enter the pass in batches. The first batch of more than 500 people entered the pass yesterday and reported to the nearest postal bureau to await instructions. The remaining 1,500 to 1,600 employees will also enter the pass in batches within the next few days.</p>
<p>Huang Naishu Talks About the Blockade Situation: Huang Naishu, Director General of Posts, told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the Ministry of Communications ordered the blockade of postal bureaus in the Northeast due to the seizure of postal services in the Northeast. Therefore, all bureaus outside the pass were completely blocked from the 25th of this month. As for the transferred employees, the first batch of more than 500 people entered the pass this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) and reported to the nearest postal bureau. The remaining employees will also be transferred back in batches. As for Ba Lidi, Postal Director of Liaoning District, and Smith, Postal Director of Jilin and Heilongjiang District, etc., they are still outside the pass and the date of entering the pass has not been determined. After the blockade of postal services in the Northeast, all mail to European and American countries, which used to be delivered via Siberia, will now be delivered by sea. Counterfeit stamps issued by the rebels will, of course, be invalid. Postal service is a unified national undertaking and absolutely no disruption from any party is allowed. As for the loss and injury suffered by postal workers in the Northeast, there have been several cases. With sorrow, we have lodged a serious protest with Japan. The only fundamental solution is to quickly recover the lost territory of the Northeast, so that all cases can be solved easily.</p>
<p>Mail to Europe Takes More Time: The North China Daily News reported that the Shanghai Postal Department announced that, due to the postal bureaus in the three eastern provinces being forcibly occupied by the Manchurian puppet government, mail and packages of all kinds to the three eastern provinces have been suspended since July 24. All mail to various parts of Europe, which was originally transported by the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Siberian Railway, has been changed to be transported by sea since July 25. The Dollar Steamship Company's mail ship Madison is scheduled to set sail on the 25th, carrying a large number of mail to Europe, which used to take three weeks to arrive via the Siberian Railway, but now it will take eight or nine days longer. According to Huang Naishu, Director General of Posts, mail to Europe will be transported via Canada or the Suez Canal in the future, using the fastest ships. As for mail from Europe to Shanghai, because postal workers in the three eastern provinces have been ordered to withdraw, European mail that has arrived in Manchuria since July 24 has been stopped from being forwarded. In addition, newspapers from the local area to the three eastern provinces cannot be sent directly by the post office to Shenyang, but if the newspaper has a manager in Dalian, it can be sent to Dalian and forwarded to Shenyang.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Japanese Residents <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Planning to Establish a Temporary Post Office</p>
<p>Although the Japanese Consulate Has Denied It</p>
<p>Japanese Residents are Still Proceeding</p>
<p>To be Implemented on August 1st</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reported that Japanese residents in Shanghai, who have been greatly affected by our blockade of postal bureaus in the East Province, held a meeting a few days ago to request the Japanese Consulate to set up a temporary post office dedicated to receiving and sending mail to the East Province for their compatriots. However, according to the Japanese Consulate, this matter is of great importance and it is inconvenient to grant this request from the compatriots. Moreover, postal work is complicated and cannot be handled by setting up a temporary post office. Therefore, it has been rejected. However, according to other sources, although the Japanese Consulate is inconvenient to openly do this due to international relations, Japanese residents are actually actively proceeding with it. It is reported that the Japanese Residents' Association Committee has held several meetings on this issue. Our postal bureau believes that if the Japanese do this, it will violate the spirit of the Universal Postal Union regulations and undermine the integrity of our sovereignty. Therefore, it has ordered the Shanghai Postal Administration to strictly investigate the truth so that it can be reported to the Ministry and forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to file a protest. The various news are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Consulate States: A reporter from the China East News Agency asked Mr. Shirai, the Japanese Deputy Consul stationed in Shanghai, about the attitude of the Japanese residents in Shanghai in organizing a post office. According to Shirai, the Japanese Consulate has no intention of organizing a post office, because postal service is the entire sovereignty of the country and foreigners should not interfere. If a post office is organized, it will conflict with international law. Japanese residents stationed in Shanghai feel inconvenienced because the Chinese authorities have implemented a blockade of postal services in the Northeast, and they may have made this request, but the consulate cannot approve it. As for Japanese residents who entrust ships to transport their private mail to Liaoning, it is their personal action and has nothing to do with the consulate. The reporter also asked what the Japanese side thinks about our country's implementation of the blockade of postal services in the Northeast. According to Shirai, the Japanese government will, of course, protest to the Chinese government about this matter.</p>
<p>Japanese Temporary Post Office: The Shiwen News Agency reported that Japanese residents in Shanghai are planning to set up a temporary post office dedicated to receiving and sending Japanese mail to the Northeast. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Lin Xiongji, chairman of the Japanese chambers of commerce in Shanghai, had a two-hour discussion with Japanese Consul Murai. After leaving the Japanese consulate, at 3:00 PM, he issued an emergency notice in the name of the committee, stating that an emergency standing committee meeting would be held at the Japanese Club at 4:00 PM to discuss the date of commencement of the temporary post office and various procedures. All members of the standing committee were present and unanimously decided: (1) Within a month of the trial operation, Japanese residents in Shanghai will be temporarily exempted from sending mail to the Northeast. If the Northeast postal service is still blocked after one month, the previous charging method for mail to the Northeast will still be strictly implemented. (2) The date of commencement of the temporary post office has been decided to be August 1.</p>
<p>Japanese Ships Transport for Free: The Shiwen News Agency reported that the Dalian Steamship Company and Japan Mail Steamship Company have given a very satisfactory answer to the request made by Yasui, the acting administrative committee chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, to allocate ships to transport Japanese mail to the Northeast. They have also agreed to transport it completely free of charge during the first month of the trial period, and to formulate a plan for subsidies and miscellaneous expenses after one month. The opening date of the ships is every Monday, and each company will allocate a ship for transport. Yasui also gave a very detailed report at the standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon. The Shanghai branches of the Dalian Steamship Company and Japan Mail Steamship Company also sent authorized representatives to attend the meeting to discuss the plan.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Parting Words of Ma Kui <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>General Ma's Resolve to Resist Japan to the Death Remains Consistent</p>
<p>If the Nation Has Not Abandoned the Northeast, Please Expedite Assistance</p>
<p>Ma Kui, son of Ma Zhanshan, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Ding Shiqiang, son of Ding Chao, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, Wang Yong, Chief of Staff to Chairman Ma, and Zang Qifang, former Mayor of Tianjin, etc., after coming to Shanghai for discussions, returned north the day before yesterday. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency had the opportunity to meet with young Master Ma and others a few days ago and spoke with them at length. They provided extremely detailed explanations regarding the military and popular sentiment in the Northeast. Following their instructions, the publication was delayed for two days, and it is therefore recorded today. Those concerned about the situation in the Northeast should not regard this as yesterday's news.</p>
<p>Young Master Ma Speaks: According to young Master Ma, his father, around February 27th of this year, acted perforce out of necessity, temporizing with the Japanese. The inner pain at that time was beyond description. Therefore, after arriving in Shenyang, on February 29th, he dispatched a trusted aide disguised as a merchant to enter the customs and report to Director Zhang in Beiping. Because his father was not well-versed in literacy and could not write letters, he only told the aide, "Now I am under the power of the Japanese, like Guan Yu in Cao Cao's camp, my heart is truly with Han. When the opportunity arises, I will rise up again." He also asked him to report to the central government, but still feeling it was not adequate, he dispatched me on March 4th, taking a detour to Europe, and returning to the country by ship from Italy, to report to the central government</p>
<p>and Beiping. When I returned to the country the previous month, I learned that my father had already returned to Heilongjiang Province. However, my father's previous actions had caused suspicion among some people. Now that the truth is out, compatriots across the country have all forgiven him and still expect him to be one who will resist Japan to the end. But what I want to tell compatriots across the country is that my father is completely determined to save the country this time, vowing to fight the Japanese to the death, not succumbing to power, not yielding to profit. Even if he cannot destroy this Rising Sun, he will use all his strength to recover the lost territory, he said.</p>
<p>Military Situation in the Northeast: According to a certain important person who came with Ma, the current situation in the Northeast is as follows: In Heilongjiang Province, the troops currently led by Chairman Ma consist of more than ten brigades, with an estimated 250,000 men. There are also about 80,000 cavalry. Military equipment is quite sufficient, but bullets are needed urgently. In addition, the volunteer army led by Li Haiqing has about 20,000 men, and the militia has 500 to 600 men per regiment, totaling more than 30 counties. In terms of military equipment, there is no need to worry about a shortage of rifles, but what is lacking are heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns, but the numbers are also not small. The Japanese army is eliminated by these volunteer armies and militias by about 400 to 500 people from time to time. However, the sacrifices of our volunteer army are also quite numerous. Currently, three-tenths of the total area of Heilongjiang Province is in Japanese hands, but all are around the railway, such as the Qiqihar-Keshan Line, the Hulan-Hailun Line, and the Chinese Eastern Railway. They dare not go more than ten miles away from it. As for the regular troops in Jilin Province, there are about 150,000 in total under Ding Chao and Li Du. Many have died in the past battles with the Japanese army. In addition, Gong Changhai, Feng Zhanmei, and the volunteer army Wang Delin and others have more than 35,000 troops, scattered along the eastern border of Jilin. The entire area of Jilin Province, from Dunhua in the south to the northeastern corner of the Songhua River in the north, five-sixths of the area is in the hands of the Japanese, with only one-sixth still within the scope of our army. As for the area along the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Xinjing-Harbin-Changchun Line, the total number of small volunteer teams is still over 6,000. There are also many with 400 to 500 men in the Changchun and Harbin areas, but because the opportunity has not arrived, ammunition is insufficient, and communication is not established, they are still waiting for orders from the central government to move out. In the Liaoning area, the remaining troops are currently held captive by the Japanese. Only Tang Juwu's troops in eastern Liaoning are under the command of Yu Zhishan, but now, after contacting various parties, there are also 5,000 to 6,000 men. Although they are held captive by the Japanese, if the central government is truly determined to recover the lost territory, they will surely be able to serve the motherland. The volunteer armies in various places in Shenyang also have considerable strength, and are now mostly located east of the South Manchuria Railway and north of Andong. In the Taonan area, Zhang HaiPeng's troops still have 30,000 men, and although they are currently interacting with the Japanese, it is definitely not their true intention. They are all near the Taonan-Changchun Line. In western Liaoning, such as the Yingkou-Goubangzi-Jin County area, there are also more than 100,000 men, now scattered in various places in groups of one or two thousand, but unfortunately lacking a commander. However, they are still confronting the Japanese. These troops do not dare to enter the cities, but the Japanese army does not dare to look at them directly. In southern Liaoning, there are the most militias, with a large portion of about 20,000 men. The remaining large counties and dozens of villages are linked together, and their power cannot be underestimated. Moreover, they have sufficient ammunition and are fighting hard against the Japanese army. The above is just a general situation. What the people of the country should pay attention to now is that if they recognize that the three northeastern provinces are still the whole problem of the Republic of China, they should quickly rise up and provide assistance. Otherwise, with the Japanese scheming and plotting, there will definitely be further aggressive means. What they fear now is our volunteer army. Therefore, they have recently begun to transplant their veterans to the Northeast. This is the first step in preparing to eliminate our volunteer army. If we do not rush to rescue them, the consequences will be unbearable.</p>
<p>Popular Sentiment in General: Continuing, he said, "If the Northeast Incident had occurred thirty years ago, the three northeastern provinces would have long fallen into Japanese hands, with absolutely no room for resistance. This is because the people of the Northeast thirty years ago did not have the intellectual development they have today, and their concept of the nation was extremely superficial. Now, the people of the Northeast have made rapid progress in their knowledge, and their spirit of loving the country and the race is extremely enthusiastic and indignant. Since the incident, in the Rehe area, three or four people have been coming and going every day to make contact, and it is not just one organization. Sometimes it is even rumored that the central government has sent a large army to resist Japan, or that the Beiping army has been dispatched. Although this is close to rumor, their psychology of not forgetting the motherland and eagerly hoping for central government rescue can be seen. To give another example to prove it, when the puppet state was established, celebrations were required everywhere in the Shenyang and Harbin areas. All section members and above had to kneel and kowtow. Each person celebrating held a lamp, but before arriving in Shenyang for the celebration, their lamps were automatically destroyed. This was because they were forced and not voluntary. Even when kneeling and kowtowing, except for a few people on the platform, no one else knelt. In addition, there were many congratulatory slogans posted along the way that day, but the next day they were all torn down by children. If even children are like this, one can imagine the rest. In total, the popular sentiment in the three provinces is somewhat different only near southern Manchuria. The reason is that southern Manchuria has long been under the sphere of Japanese influence, leading to familiarity and lack of awareness. But it is also only a small number, not all. Therefore, I dare to say that although the people of the three northeastern provinces now appear to be dealing with the Japanese, they are only feigning compliance. If there is a complete solution within the customs, all places outside the customs will immediately become armed comrades. Therefore, when recovering the lost territory in the future, this general popular sentiment will definitely provide a great force. Moreover, military victory or defeat is not necessarily about sharp weapons and sufficient ammunition. In ancient times, it was not uncommon for the few to defeat the many. Furthermore, taking the troops of Xi Qia as an example, their soldiers are now under the power of the Japanese army, so they dare not act. If there is a proper solution, they can immediately turn against the Japanese. Taking Xi Qia's previous battle on the Harbin-Changchun Line as an example, when they came into contact with the troops of Ding and Du, they shouted, "How can Chinese people fight their own people?" After shouting, they dispersed in all directions, some defected, some scattered. The previous Battle of Jiangqiao by General Ma was also like this. If these troops had not defected, the Japanese army would not have been so quickly and miserably defeated, although they finally ran out of ammunition and retreated to Hailun. But although this is the action of soldiers, it is also a manifestation of popular sentiment. Therefore, in reality, very few people sincerely submit to the puppet state. Those who do are all those who had conflicts with Zhang Hanqing in the past. Otherwise, the puppet state could never have been established. Currently,</p>
<p>youths of the intellectual class in the three northeastern provinces have returned to Beiping and Tianjin in droves. Those without knowledge, those who can leave have all left, and the rest have joined the volunteer army. Therefore, if there is a solution now, even the university students in the three provinces can immediately call up 3,000 people (there are also 18,000 people who have received military knowledge in the military). These people remain in the Northeast because there is no political solution, and they are all enduring a life of suffering, depression, and indignation. If the central government once has a solution, they are the best vanguard of the people. However, if the government continues to wait and see in the future and still does not adopt a practical method of recovering the territory by force, then this group of young people will definitely have a very serious tragedy. I believe it will be ten times more harmful than the bombs of the Korean people, because they will never be willing to submit to the iron heel of Japanese imperialism. I especially hope that the people of Shanghai will not, because the sound of guns and artillery has moved away from their ears due to the Shanghai War Settlement, neglect the 30 million compatriots in the Northeast who are in deep waters. Whether it is money or ammunition, if it can be continuously supplied, with the strong popular sentiment and arduous struggle in the Northeast, it will definitely not cause the White Mountains and Black Waters to fall under the clogs forever, he said.</p>

<p>First Review Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association for National Salvation held its first review committee meeting at the Bank Association yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM. Many people including Wang Xiaolai attended, and many important cases were resolved. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attending Committee Members: The review committee members who attended included Wang Xiaolai, Wang Zhengting, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Ning Yuanyuan, Lin Wojiang, and many others. Chairman Song Yuanyuan reported on the meeting process and then discussed the revision of the draft and other matters.</p>
<p>Matters Resolved: The matters resolved are as follows: (1) The general association's location will be in Shanghai (2) The first board of directors of the general association will be appointed by the government (3) All citizens of the Republic of China can be members of the association and pay an aviation national salvation fee of one yuan or more per month, which must not be used for other purposes. The rules for collecting money will be set separately (4) The general association's expenses will be allocated by the government, and the provincial branch associations will be allocated by the provincial government. The national salvation fund will be used as an aviation fund, and the membership fee will be borne by the authorities (5) Wang Rutang, Wang Xiaolai, and Lin Kanghou were recommended as members to revise the rules and regulations in principle.</p>
<p>Lin Wojiang Speaks: After the meeting, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Mr. Lin Wojiang. According to him, the Aviation Association for National Salvation is determined to become a purely popular aviation organization. The government is only in a supervisory position, assisting and guiding everything. In the future, it will be used exclusively for defending against foreign enemies. As for the funds for opening, donations will be raised from the public. However, the funds obtained will only be used for aviation. As for the members, they will be allocated by the local authorities. This matter is very hopeful for the future of aviation in our country. Mr. Lin is scheduled to go to Beijing in the next few days.</p>
<p>Manufacturing New Aircraft: During the 19th Route Army's anti-Japanese war, the Aviation Administration received quite a few donations from overseas Chinese. It has now used these donations to build aircraft. The Nanjing Aviation Factory is designing and manufacturing aircraft named "Overseas Chinese." There are about three or four of them, which are reconnaissance aircraft and bomber types. It is expected that they will be successful in the near future. These new aircraft are based on the latest American models. If purchased in the United States, each would cost 150,000 yuan. Now, each costs only slightly less than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng's Proposal: Zeng Yijing, Director of the Naval Aviation Manufacturing Office, has extremely deep research and experience in aviation science and aviation industry. Since taking charge of the Naval Aviation Manufacturing Office, he has made plans and managed it, and the atmosphere has been completely new. The effectiveness of the aircraft manufactured by the office itself is no less than that of imported aircraft. However, due to limited funds, Mr. Zeng's ambitions have not been fully realized. Recently, with the establishment of the Aviation Association for National Salvation in Shanghai, Mr. Zeng greatly agrees and plans to have three proposals, all of which are fundamental plans for the development of aviation. The well-known figures in this city, Lin Kanghou, Zhu Boquan, Ye Chunquan, Zhang Naiqi, Chen Xingwei, Shen Shuyu, Yao Yongli, Wu Wenwei, Zhu Zhuanghua, and others, in view of Mr. Zeng's enthusiasm, express their sympathy and specially jointly submit Mr. Zeng's proposals to the Aviation Association for National Salvation, requesting public decision and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Zhang Xueliang's Advisor, Donald <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Came to Shanghai Yesterday to Meet Song</p>
<p>Scheduled to Fly Back to Beiping This Morning</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Beiping-Tianjin Pacification Headquarters, specially sent his advisor, Donald, to Shanghai by plane at 5:30 PM the night before to discuss military expenditure issues. He visited Minister of Finance Song Ziwen to discuss the matter. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited him at his residence yesterday. According to him, his visit was indeed on behalf of Zhang to discuss military expenditure issues. However, I (Donald referring to himself) have not yet visited at this time (around 5:00 PM), and I plan to visit tonight and, after meeting and discussing, I will be ready to take the original plane back to Beiping at 6:00 AM this morning (26th). If time permits, I also plan to stop briefly and then head north again. As for the Rehe Incident, when I left Beiping the morning before yesterday, the latest news I heard was that the Japanese army had already withdrawn to Jinzhou, and that transportation had been restored. However, this is the news reported by the Japanese side, and it is not known whether it is reliable. It is also rumored that the Japanese side made two demands, which Tang Yulin has accepted, and that Zhang Xueliang will counterattack Liaoning, etc., all of which are propaganda by the Japanese side. In fact, Director Zhang has made considerable preparations, but they cannot be disclosed in the newspaper. I firmly believe that if Japan still does not realize its mistakes, it will eventually fail. At 7:00 PM, the reporter inquired Donald by telephone and learned that he had not yet met with Song, but he was ready to visit soon.</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Bloodstains of the Songhu War Have Not Dried <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Large Quantities of Japanese Goods Are Being Shipped</p>
<p>"Huashan Maru" Carries Thousands of Tons of Goods</p>
<p>Shipped to North China for Sale Today</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Customs Brokers Are Very Active</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, the people of the country rose up to resist Japanese goods. During the January 28th Incident this year, the municipal government surrendered to Japan, and the Japanese army attacked Zhabei that night, causing the war. Trade in Japanese goods in China all stopped. After the Japanese troops withdrew, Japanese merchants urgently sought to restore business with China. However, the boycott movement in the inland was very strong. In the past two months, the import of Japanese goods has been very crowded. Except for a part shipped to various places, the rest are stored in warehouses. Recently, Japanese expatriates in Shanghai are urgently seeking to eliminate our country's boycott of Japanese goods. Today, a large amount of oriental goods began to be loaded to various ports in North China. The details of this matter are investigated and reported as follows.</p>
<p>Negotiations to Stop the Rejection of Goods: Japanese residents in Shanghai, because the Japanese merchants in various places north and south of the Yangtze River who withdrew during the war have now returned to restore pre-war trade. However, because the rejection of goods in the inland is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, Japanese goods cannot be sold smoothly. The Japanese goods stored in various warehouses in Shanghai amount to tens of thousands of tons. Now they plan to find a way to ship them out. Therefore, a general meeting was specially held to decide to request the Japanese consul in Shanghai to negotiate with our municipal government, requesting our side to fulfill the agreement of January 28th negotiated by Mayor Wu and the Japanese consul, which prohibited Chinese people from boycotting Japanese goods and stopping the rejection of goods movement in various places. They demanded that our government authorities ban it by order. Otherwise, the Japanese side will take further effective coercive measures.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Piled Up in Various Warehouses: Since the Japanese Post Office resumed the four China-Japan routes, the import of Japanese goods has surged again. Cotton cloth, beer, foreign paper, medicines, leather, toys, etc., are transported in large quantities. The last "Rokka Maru" imported more than 16,000 pieces of Japanese goods. Yesterday, the "Ikomaru" arrived in Shanghai and brought more than 9,700 pieces. As a result, the Japanese goods piled up like mountains in the warehouses of Mitsubishi and HSBC docks. There are still large quantities of oriental goods being continuously loaded to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Exports Today: North China has the most prosperous route for Japanese goods. Recently, since the Dalian Customs blockade occurred, our country must collect import taxes on goods transported to various places in the Northeast through Shanghai. The Japanese side falsely accused us of imposing double customs duties. A large number of Japanese goods in Shanghai are being actively loaded by Japanese merchants to be transferred to North China. Yesterday, the "Huashan Maru" of Nisshin specially moved from Pudong to the Mitsubishi dock to facilitate the loading of huge amounts of Japanese goods onto the ship. The total number is several thousand tons. The "Huashan Maru" is fully loaded. This is the first ship to openly transport large quantities of Japanese goods for export, and it is also the largest batch since September 18th.</p>
<p>Resumption of Japanese Ships on the Yangtze River: For Japanese goods going to the Yangtze River, there have been no ships from the East transporting goods to Shanghai since September last year. Until the 22nd of this month, they finally arrived. Japanese kelp, which had not been imported for ten months, has also begun to be transported. The first batch of Japanese goods to the Yangtze River amounted to more than 700 pieces and has been unloaded at the HSBC and Mitsubishi docks. It is scheduled to be transported to Hankou and other places by Nisshin wheels on the 28th. Japanese wheels on the Yangtze River will also officially resume operations from that day and openly solicit and transport Japanese goods. The Japanese goods customs broker firms organized by Shanghai's traitor merchants Wang and Li have been very active since yesterday, reporting and loading Japanese goods on behalf of others.</p>

<p>Household Registration Survey in the City</p>
<p>Decrease of Over 90,000 Households and Over 380,000 People</p>
<p>Total Loss of Over 2,000 Buildings</p>
<p>The household registration statistics of this city were previously affected by the war. Except for western Shanghai, southern Shanghai, and Pudong, other districts could not be surveyed. The entire statistics. Now all the areas previously occupied by Japanese soldiers have been returned one after another through negotiations, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau has re-surveyed and reorganized the household registration. Now that it has been organized, a reporter specially visited Wu Hefu, director of the Household Registration Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who showed a statistical table of the household population situation before and after the war and the damage to houses. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>After the War Statistics of Increase or Decrease in Households, Population, and Houses in Each District</p>
<p>District Decrease Increase Decrease Increase Decrease Increase</p>
<p>District 1 2939 16161 25</p>

<p>Total Decrease 94468 2891 2058</p>
<p>Moreover, District 5 is adjacent to the concession, and a part of it is a road built beyond the boundary. Therefore, there are quite a few foreigners living in the district. According to the latest statistics, there are 3,009 Japanese, 145 Americans, and 178 Portuguese. There are also foreign residents from other countries, totaling 2,435 men and 2,166 women surveyed. However, there are more than 200 foreign households that have refused to be surveyed. Their nationalities have been reported separately for negotiations.</p>

<p>About the Whereabouts of Soldiers Liang and Fang</p>
<p>The Municipal Government's Negotiations with the Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>It has been reported in the newspapers for several days that Hu Jinzhong, a soldier of the 19th Route Army, was detained by the Japanese army for no reason. After escaping and returning, he stated the suffering he had endured and said that there were still two companions, Liang Guangxin and Fang Da, who were still being held, etc. Reporters from various newspapers drove to the Municipal Government last night to inquire about the news of handling this case. Secretary-General Yu personally received them and briefly said that after receiving this report, the Municipal Government sent Hong, director of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau, to negotiate with the Japanese Consulate. According to Director Hong's report, Consul General Shirai said that all the sections reported in the newspaper were not facts. At that time, soldiers Liang and Fang went to the Osaka Wharf. The Japanese soldiers suspected that they were suspicious, so they ordered them to stay temporarily in the police pavilion at the wharf to be checked. The next day, the soldiers took the Shengjing Maru to Fujian and were not beaten or abused. Mr. Yu also said that the Municipal Government now believes that this matter will not be difficult to get to the bottom of the truth. It has now cabled the 19th Route Army Headquarters stationed in Fujian to inquire about the whereabouts of the soldiers.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Mr. Xu Jiqing Publishes Opinions on Abolishing the Tael and Changing to the Yuan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Legal Tender Should Be Calculated Based on the Silver Content Plus Minting Costs</p>
<p>The Fineness and Weight Should Be Publicly Announced and Subject to Constant Supervision</p>
<p>Paper Money Should Be Subject to Public Inspection by the Issuing Banks</p>
<p>Suspension of Redemption and Centralization of Cash Are Unrelated to Abolishing the Tael</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan, financial leaders and economists have recently expressed many opinions. Recognizing the extreme importance of this matter, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency specially visited Mr. Xu Jiqing, a standing committee member of the Bankers Association, yesterday to ask for his views. Mr. Xu has served in the banking industry for more than twenty years, having served as acting governor of the Central Bank and concurrently as director of the mint. His views are highly valued by society. The following is a record of Mr. Xu's formal article to the Xinsheng News Agency titled "An Admonition to Those Who Doubt the Abolition of the Tael and Change to the Yuan."</p>
<p>The matter of abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan has been advocated by us for fifteen years. This is the initial step in reforming the monetary system and is not the end goal. Major aspects such as unifying silver coins, issuing coins, and reorganizing subsidiary coins must all be gradually promoted. After several consultations between the Ministry of Finance authorities and people in the financial industry, it seemed that it could be implemented immediately. Unexpectedly, there are some doubters in the financial industry, and some doubters outside the financial industry, such as economists and lawyers. However, Chinese and foreign merchants unanimously advocate reform. Let us first talk about the benefits of abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan: (1) The financial industry does not need two types of reserves; (2) The public does not have the loss of two types of exchange; (3) When paying customs duties, there is no loss of three types of exchange, converting yuan to tael and tael to customs tael; (4) In international trade, there is no loss of three types of exchange, converting yuan to tael and tael to gold. These are just the major benefits. As reported in various newspapers, people in our financial industry and economists have thoroughly explained the advantages and disadvantages, so there is no need to repeat them. However, looking at the doubters these days, they are not all the same. Generally speaking, there are four major concerns: (1) How to determine the legal tender price; (2) Whether the fineness and weight can be maintained; (3) Whether the issuing banks can avoid excessive issuance; (4) Whether the suspension of redemption and centralization of cash will occur again. Let's first talk about the legal tender price. Every silver yuan should be based on its silver content, and then the actual minting cost should be added to the amount of silver to determine the future legal tender price. This can be proven by numbers. The Ministry of Finance has also stated that it will definitely not seek profits from the mint. This is the first thing that should not be doubted. Next, let's talk about the fineness and weight. The fineness and weight of silver dollars in the future are indeed a cause for concern for us. However, the Nanjing Mint has already been destroyed, and the Hangzhou Mint has also stopped minting. The government will definitely crack down on the remaining mints in various provinces. Assuming that the Central Mint opens minting one day, it will definitely have the effect of unifying coin rights. Once the fineness and weight are determined, they can be announced to the world. It is expected that the matter of public verification can definitely be implemented, and various public groups can also participate and supervise at any time. This is the second thing that should not be doubted. Again, let's talk about whether the issuing banks can avoid excessive issuance. Since the National Government established Nanjing in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Bank of China, fearing the disturbances of the situation, took the lead in advocating the opening of issuance and the establishment of an inspection committee, which inspected twice a month. The committee included one director of the Currency Department, two representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, two representatives from the Shanghai Bankers Association, two representatives from the Shanghai Money Dealers Association, two representatives from the note-receiving banks and money shops, and one accountant. Over the past five or six years, its credit has been particularly prominent. The prescribed 60% cash reserve and 40% security reserve have not been reduced. This can be seen in the announcements in various newspapers. Secondly, banks such as the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Four Banks Joint Treasury, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the China Industrial Bank are inspected monthly by the bank's board of directors and supervisors together with accountants, or by accountants alone. The prescribed 60% cash reserve and 40% security reserve have also not been reduced. This can also be seen in the announcements in various newspapers. In my opinion, those that have been jointly inspected by representatives of various public groups need not be discussed. If those that have not been jointly inspected by representatives of various public groups, the issuing banks can also invite representatives to participate. It is said that a small number of issuing banks that have not been announced can also prepare for public disclosure. The proponents of paper money seem to be alarming. Examining paper money, redemption is the principle. May I ask, without hard currency as a reserve, how can soft currency be issued? This is the third thing that should not be doubted. Again, let's talk about whether the suspension of redemption and centralization of cash will occur again. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor and ordered the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications to suspend redemption. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Hankou government ordered the centralization of cash. We should not hide the facts of the then government, but these temporary orders were limited to Beijing and Hankou. At that time, Shanghai did not receive the order, so it was not affected. These were all facts before the tael was abolished and the silver yuan was not changed. If we worry that such facts may occur from time to time after the abolition of the tael and the change to the yuan, I dare not believe that it will definitely not happen. Assuming a bad government, regardless of whether the tael has been abolished or not, regardless of whether the silver yuan has been changed or not, if it wants to suspend redemption, it will suspend it. If it wants to centralize cash, it will centralize it. What relationship does this have with the issue of abolishing the tael and changing to the yuan? This is the fourth thing that should not be doubted. I recall that during the May Fourth Movement in the eighth year of the Republic of China, the foreign cent rose to eight qian. Chinese and foreign silver and money dealers jointly planned to cancel the market for British Dragon silver dollars, and British silver dollars gradually disappeared. National currency was able to circulate. Whose power was it? It was the result of the concerted efforts of our financial industry. Now that national currency is already circulating, advancing to abolish the tael will definitely be effective quickly. After the abolition, the reorganization of transfer coins will be started immediately, and the casting of decimal silver and copper subsidiary coins will be prepared. At that time, if there are any further doubts, I will still cite the actual effect of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications issuing decimal subsidiary coin notes in the past four or five years to inform you. This is truly welcomed by the market, and you all say that there is no need to doubt it. In short, whenever a system is reformed, there will definitely be doubters. Based on what I have known for more than ten years, I will provide an explanation to those who have doubts from all walks of life, and it can also be a reply to reporters who frequently visit. Whether it is a merit or a crime is beyond my knowledge.</p>

The proceedings were as follows: (A) Reports: (1) Chairman Hu delivered the opening speech, first explaining that Northwest research is extremely important in terms of national defense, democracy, and culture, and then discussing the nature of the association, which is to develop the Northwest using the results of scientific research, purely as an academic organization rather than a political one. (2) Chairman Pan reported on the association's preparation process and the hopes for Hu Shuhua, Guo Weiping, Zhang Zilian, and Hu Juewen, who are going to the Northwest to investigate industries. (B) Discussions and Resolutions: (1) Passed the articles of association; (2) Elected officers.

<p>The Shanghai Port Quarantine Office has recently attached great importance to the quarantine of imported merchant ships. All imported ships must not enter the Huangpu River without authorization and must wait for the doctor to examine the passengers before being allowed to enter the port. When each ship arrives in Shanghai, it flies a yellow flag during the day and a three-color red light at night. Yesterday, the China Merchants Bureau's Xinfeng Steamer had a conflict with the Shanghai Port Quarantine Office. The Xinfeng was even prohibited from unloading cargo. It was not until the afternoon that the matter was resolved through negotiations between the two parties. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Entering the Port with Flag Flying: The China Merchants Bureau's Xinfeng Steamer, sailing from Tianjin to Shanghai, received a telegram from the head office ordering the ship to proceed to Wusong, where the passengers on board had to be quarantined by the Shanghai Port Quarantine Office. During the day, the ship was ordered to fly the yellow square flag, and the quarantine doctor would arrive. Yesterday morning, the Xinfeng arrived at Wusong and followed the new regulations, hoisting the yellow flag high. The ship moved slowly, but unexpectedly, after sailing into the Wusongkou, no doctor was seen to arrive on board for quarantine. Later, it was learned that the quarantine ship at Wusongkou had been destroyed by the Japanese army and was now being quarantined on the Yangshupu River surface. The Xinfeng then sailed to Yangshupu, but still no doctor arrived. It had no choice but to sail slowly to the Jinliyuan Wharf and docked at 8:40 a.m. By 9 a.m., the doctor had not yet arrived, and the passengers were already causing a commotion on the ship.</p>
<p>Passengers Left Before Doctor Arrived: The Xinfeng had a total of 200 to 300 passengers from Tianjin to Shanghai. When the ship arrived at the wharf, the passengers rushed ashore. The crew could not stop them and had to let the passengers leave the ship. By 9:30 a.m., all the passengers on the ship had disembarked, leaving no one on board. At this time, the medical officer from the Shanghai Port Quarantine Office arrived late. Upon arriving on board and seeing no passengers, he immediately negotiated with the crew. First Mate Jiang Changqing told the doctor that the Xinfeng had been flying the yellow flag since Wusong and entering the port along the river, but no doctor had come for quarantine. It was your office's own negligence, not the ship's evasion. By the time the ship arrived and the passengers left, the crew could not stop them, and the blame was not on the ship.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Unloading: The doctor was furious upon hearing Jiang's words and refused to admit his mistake of being late and derelict in his duties. He immediately went to the shipowner and negotiated with the Xinfeng's shipowner, a foreigner named Crowe, accusing the Xinfeng of violating the Shanghai Port Quarantine Regulations. He then forcibly ordered the ship's engineer to raise the water police flag and summon the water patrol officers. First Mate Jiang Changqing considered this move to be of great importance and stepped forward to stop it, but shipowner Crowe instead ordered the engineer to quickly raise the water police flag. Jiang immediately reported to the bureau. In an instant, the water police arrived on board in response to the call, suspecting that a major incident had occurred on the ship. After the fully armed water police arrived on board, the doctor from the Shanghai Port Office ordered the water police to guard the Xinfeng Steamer and not allow the ship to unload its cargo, thus causing a major dispute.</p>
<p>Mediation Process: The doctor from the Shanghai Port Office prohibited the Xinfeng from unloading, causing panic among the dockworkers and the consignees. They rushed to the bureau to inquire. At the same time, the Shanghai Port Quarantine Office also sent medical officer Chen Yonghan to the China Merchants Bureau to negotiate with Wang Tong, the director of the shipping department. Wang explained to Chen that the Xinfeng had no intention of resisting or violating the quarantine. "After the flag was raised, the doctor did not arrive," and the ship had no way to force the passengers to stay on board. In the afternoon, Wang Tong personally went to the Shanghai Port Quarantine Office and met with Wu Liande, explaining the misunderstanding and requesting that the water police be withdrawn so that the Xinfeng could unload its cargo. It was not until the afternoon that the matter was resolved, and the Xinfeng's cargo was able to be opened and unloaded, but it had been delayed for half a day, causing great concern among the dockworkers and cargo owners.</p>

<p>Water Bill Increases More Than Sevenfold</p>
<p>Various Property Management Offices Send Letters to the Real Estate Association for Negotiation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association received letters yesterday from member companies reporting that the Shanghai Water Company is charging according to the newly installed water meters without obtaining the consent of the homeowners. According to the report from Qinyu Company, the water bill for June increased more than sevenfold compared to May. The two letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Jingji Company's Water Bill Increases Threefold: Respectfully, the Shanghai Water Company revised the new contract for water meter billing, and our office refused to sign it and has not recognized it. Unexpectedly, the water company used coercive tactics and acted arbitrarily. Starting from June of this year, it directly calculated according to the water meter reading. Our office received a water bill for June a few days ago, stating that from May 31 to June 25, a total of 25 days, the water consumption was 200,050 gallons, totaling 127.81 yuan, an increase of about three times compared to the original fixed water rate, accounting for 25% of the total house rent. The owner is really unable to bear such an unexpected loss. Now, the total income of the rent for each door number in this neighborhood is listed, and the water bills for January, February, and June of this year are submitted to your association. Please lodge a strong protest with the water company to protect property rights. Sincerely, Shanghai Real Estate Association, Jingji Company, represented by Sun Hezhai.</p>
<p>Qinyu Company's Letter Reporting Water Bill Increase of Sevenfold: Respectfully, our company owns 67 houses in Qinyu Lane, east of Yangshupu Bridge. The total monthly rent is 887 yuan. The water bill for May was 61.85 yuan. Yesterday, we received a water bill from the Shanghai Water Company for June, calculated according to the meter reading for 24 days, totaling 431.81 yuan, which is seven times higher than the May bill. Our company cannot accept it. It is said that the water will be cut off on June 28 if there is no reply. This is a special report to the Shanghai Real Estate Association.</p>

<p>Reporting on the Initiation Process</p>
<p>Organizing Branches in Other Cities</p>
<p>The Chinese National Save-by-Cutting-Down-and-Eating-Less Society sent a letter to its members in other cities yesterday, stating: "In response to your previous letter, we learned that you share our sympathy for the society's purpose and intend to join. Because the society is in the process of applying to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters for permission to organize, we did not dare to reply rashly to letters from comrades in other cities before obtaining the Party Headquarters' permission, causing you to be anxious. We apologize for this. The society was initially founded by a small number of comrades and named the 'Save-on-Clothing-and-Food Comrades Society.' There was no consideration at the time. Later, more and more comrades joined in this city, and the National Government issued a nationwide decree on May 11, instructing the people to practice cutting down on clothing and food, and to strive for production to save the country. Therefore, some comrades in the society proposed to change the name to the 'Chinese National Save-by-Cutting-Down-and-Eating-Less Society' in accordance with the spirit of the National Government's instructions, in order to expand publicity and establish branches in various places, and to formulate the general rules of the General Assembly and the organizational procedures of the branches. The third meeting of the initiators passed the proposal and submitted it to the Party Headquarters for record. Now, we have obtained the permission of the Party Headquarters and established a preparatory committee on the 17th of this month. The following eleven standing committee members were elected: Wu Banping, Chen Guangxiang, Sun Bin, Li Junpan, Pan Tianyi, Sha Shouzhong, Shen Yunyu, Li Zhineng, Wu Biaomin, Liang Gengshun, and Ren Nongxuan, and they were assigned to the five sections of 'Solicitation,' 'Publicity,' 'Investigation,' 'Documentation,' and 'Accounting' to be responsible for the preparation. This is the entire process of the society from its inception to the present. We are very grateful for the concern of the comrades for the society. We are sending you a copy of the society's constitution and a copy of the organizational procedures of the branch for your inspection. If you can invite comrades to organize branches in your area and jointly promote progress, we would be extremely fortunate."</p>

<p>China Merchants Bureau's Emei steamer, sailing from Shanghai to Chongqing, loaded cargo downstream in Chongqing on the morning of the 21st of this month. At noon, when it arrived at the Yanzhuba area, the ship was grounded in a shoal due to the rushing water. After repeated efforts by the shipowner, Mr. Ji, the Emei was pulled out during high tide half an hour later and returned to Yichang. A telegram reported yesterday morning that the Emei steamer floated up at the grounding site and sailed to Yichang without any initial damage. However, when the cargo was unloaded on the 24th, it was discovered that the keel, iron pillars, and platforms of the second cabin were all bent and damaged due to the grounding. The shipping department has reported to the General Manager Li to review the repair plan for the ship.</p>

<p>Wang Yucheng and Nine Others Arrested</p>
<p>Taihu bandit chief Wang Yucheng, also known as Shi Changqing, gathered his followers and specialized in looting at the junction of Jiangsu and Songjiang, such as robbing the Lakezhou steamer, robbing over forty boxes of cigarettes from the Nanyang Tobacco Company, over a hundred bundles of cotton yarn from Tao Jianji Yarn Company, and countless other robberies. Later, the Jiangsu-Songjiang Bandit Suppression Headquarters dispatched troops to suppress them severely, but Wang escaped the law. Therefore, the headquarters specifically ordered Detective Captain Xu Fengshan to arrest him. After receiving the order, Captain Xu came to Shanghai to investigate. He found that the bandit was hiding on a yellow sand ship No. 6012 at Guangxing Wharf in front of the Renchang Soap Factory in Yangshupu, and all the people on the ship were bandits, with two pistols and one Mauser pistol. Captain Xu then reported to the Water Patrol Police Station. The Western Detective Belikas, Chinese Detectives Sun Ajia and Hu Changqing, etc., along with Captain Xu, rushed to the scene and arrested Wang Yucheng, Zhou Menglin, Cui Desheng, Yang Zhengqing, Sun Youzhong, Wu Zhusan, Zhou Bailin, Tang Mingzhou, Tang Youlin, and nine others. During the arrest, the criminals hid their weapons in bags and threw them into the river in an attempt to destroy the evidence. However, Captain Xu showed the arrest warrant and took them all to the police station and sent them to the local court. Captain Xu requested the transfer. The prosecutor ordered them to prepare documents and come to the case to welcome the investigation.</p>

<p>An Explosion Injures Four People</p>
<p>Jin Jincheng, a 45-year-old from Shaoxing, opened the Huidacontin Copper and Tin Store at No. 8, Minguo Lane, Minguo Road, in the French Concession, buying all kinds of scrap copper and old tin for profit. During the Shanghai battle this year, many abandoned guns, cannons, shells and copper casings were left in the northern part of Shanghai, and laborers competed to pick them up and sell them to copper and tin shops, so many of them relied on this to make a profit. Jin opened a copper shop and could not be an exception. However, at 11:35 yesterday morning, Jin personally supervised his partners Ding Yifang (22 years old), Jin Guangshun (21 years old), and apprentice Chen Xiadong (15 years old) in front of the hall of the shop to identify and sort out two large sacks of copper casings. Unexpectedly, there was a live bullet mixed in. Jin did not pay attention and hit it hard with an iron hammer. Suddenly, the explosives detonated with a loud bang, shaking the neighborhood. Apprentice Chen Xiadong was more seriously injured and was immediately taken to the hospital for treatment. The other three were slightly injured and were also sent to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. The French Concession police heard the news and are now sending detectives to investigate thoroughly. They must actively ban such illegal purchases of shell copper shops.</p>

<p>Recently, the weather in this city has been unusually hot, with the Fahrenheit thermometer reaching around 100 degrees, causing epidemics to rage everywhere and the rural farmland to be extremely dry. According to farmers in the western suburbs of Shanghai and Pudong, it has not rained for almost a month, and the farmland is dry and cracked. Farmers are pumping water day and night, and they are exhausted and anxious. Moreover, due to the drying up of rivers and the scorching sun, pumping water day and night is useless, so the rice has been affected. If it does not rain soon, there will be a drought.</p>

<p>The Shanghai First Special District Court, in accordance with regulations, publicly incinerates confiscated prohibited items such as opium and raw opium every three months to emphasize the prohibition of smoking. While the public sale of opium is being touted, the court is still very strict in handling opium cases. Now that the time for incineration has arrived again, President Zhou designated the Yizhongdi of the Baoantang Hall on the south side of the North Zhejiang Road Court as the incineration site. At 8:00 yesterday morning, court clerks moved the opium, opium paste, red pills, and smoking paraphernalia confiscated in the last three months from the confiscated property warehouse to the site and burned them with dry firewood and kerosene. Court police were dispatched to the scene to supervise. In addition, several prosecutors from the court and the Second Branch of the High Court came to the scene to supervise. The Municipal Council also sent representatives to visit. The incineration was completed at around 2:00 in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Private Counterfeit Coin Factory Cracked in Tongzhou Road <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yang Deji, a native of Shaoxing, colluded with Wang Daosheng, a native of Jiangbei, to privately manufacture counterfeit coins at No. 124 Tongzhou Road, and sold them in the market to make profits. Many people were harmed by it. Sun Zhenqing, a Chinese detective from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, found out about the matter. Together with Western detectives, they went secretly at 2:00 AM yesterday morning and arrested Yang and Wang at the address. They confiscated 37 counterfeit coins, two models, an iron stove, etc. They also searched Wang's home at No. 76 Ruijin Road and found batteries, medicine powder, and rubber stamps. They took them all to the police station and then sent them to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Chen Ming, presented the case and submitted the confiscated counterfeit coins for inspection. When questioned, the defendant Yang Deji confessed that he had lost his job recently. Wang Daosheng had asked him to go to No. 124 Tongzhou Road to continue this business for the late Jin Alin, but he had not yet taken over when he was arrested by the police. Wang Daosheng confessed that these models and other items were all left behind by the late Jin Alin. Jin died on June 25. Yang Deji was indeed asked by him to do it, but only for one day. Jin Alin had been in this counterfeit coin business for two years and could buy 16 or 17 coins for each foreign coin. Judge Shen reviewed the confession and ordered them to be remanded in custody and sentenced on a fixed date.</p>

<p>At around 6:00 AM the day before yesterday, a Russian woman named Masli Kofur, 30 years old, residing at No. 14 Suzhou Road, suddenly went to Room 602 on the sixth floor of HSBC Housing at No. 56 Sichuan Road, the residence of Westerner Kaing Tai, Deputy Chief Patrol of the Central Police Station. She appeared to be drunk. The Westerner had not yet gotten out of bed and asked her what she was doing there. The Russian woman replied that she was very sorry. Kaing Tai drove her out of the room. Unexpectedly, the woman broke into the next room (which was also rented by Kai) and took out a pistol used by Kai from the closet and fired three shots at her head and chest, falling to the ground immediately and bleeding profusely. Then Miao Huating, the Chinese clerk hired by Kai, heard the noise and went in to inspect, seeing her lying in a pool of blood. He immediately ran to inform his master and reported to the Central Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They sent her to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment, but she died. The body was taken to the Ferren Road Mortuary. Yesterday morning, Zhan Liangce, prosecutor of the First Special District Court, was commissioned to come to the mortuary to examine the body and sit in court. According to Kaing Tai's (transliteration) statement, the deceased was a friend of his and there was no relationship of any kind. He was still sleeping that day when she suddenly broke into his bedroom. Seeing that she appeared to be drunk, he drove her out. Unexpectedly, she went to his next room to commit suicide. According to Miao Huating's statement of the situation at the time, Mr. Zhan ordered the examination to confirm that the deceased Russian woman, Masli Kofur, had indeed died by shooting herself with a pistol. The body was handed over to her aunt, Siber Nara, who signed an undertaking to take it back for coffin burial.</p>
<h3 id="e134">False Mortgage List for Borrowing Money <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Zhengda Bank Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Huang Zhiqing and Zou Jiabai Accused</p>
<p>Huang Zhiqing, manager of Lianchang Company, previously fabricated a list of all the properties of Chongming Electric Power Co., Ltd. in Chongming County due to the company's financial exhaustion. Together with Zou Jiabai, he mortgaged it to Zhengda Bank for a loan of 30,000 taels of silver, with the redemption period set for January 19th of the 20th year. However, after the deadline, neither the principal nor the interest was repaid. The bank then sued the Chongming County Government. When Shi Yuming and other shareholders of the Chongming Electric Light Company learned of this, they also filed a statement, stating that Huang Zhiqing's claim that the electric light factory was purchased by him was false. Huang had absolutely no mortgage right. Later, during the trial in Chongming County, Huang also admitted that the mortgage list was fabricated. In May of this year, the Chongming County Government had already ruled that the mortgage contract signed by Zhengda Bank and the two defendants, Huang and Zou, was invalid. After receiving the verdict, Zhengda negotiated with Huang and others to recover the money, but to no avail. Now, based on the verdict of the Chongming County Government, the bank has filed a criminal self-accusation against Huang and Zou with the First Special District Court for forging documents and fraudulently obtaining money. It is said that the court will open a trial soon.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Opium and Cars Confiscated <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Hong Maoting and Others Sentenced for Smuggling Opium</p>
<p>Hong Maoting, a native of Yangzhou, residing at No. 6, Bu Lin Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, in the French Concession, hired Zhu Yibiao, a car driver from the Shijie Car Company on Edward Road, driving car number 11689, to transport opium at the Taikoo Wharf at 4:45 AM on the 10th of this month. Ge Xilai (transliteration), a head constable from the Xiaodongmen French Concession Police Station, discovered this while patrolling. During the inspection, Xu Xiangkun handed the constable a roll of banknotes, worth several hundred yuan, and asked him to refrain from investigating. As the constable was about to arrest them, Hong and Zhu drove away, only Xu was caught. Subsequently, Western detectives Mu Bikun Chonggen, Mao Jinsheng, Deputy Detectives Wang Rusong, Jiang Changwen, and detectives Bao Tan Gu Hongzhou and Lu Jinxiang were dispatched to investigate. Forty-eight pounds of opium were seized in the compartment of the chartered car in the hall of No. 6 Bu Lin Lane, and Hong was arrested. Car driver Zhu Yibiao and the car were also arrested and sent to the Second Special Court. They were prosecuted in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. After Judge Wang Gangxu of the Criminal Court tried the case, he announced the end of the debate. Yesterday was the sentencing date. At 9:30 AM, Judge Wang took his seat in Criminal Court One and ordered the defendants to be brought to the court. Hong Maoting was sentenced to ten months of imprisonment and fined 1,200 yuan for the crime of possessing opium with the intent to sell it. Zhu Yibiao was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan for the crime of helping to transport opium with the intent to sell it. Xu Xiangkun was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment and fined 1,000 yuan for the crime of helping to transport opium with the intent to sell it, and sentenced to four months of imprisonment and fined 200 yuan for the crime of bribing public officials in connection with their duties, with a total imprisonment of nine months and a fine of 1,100 yuan. If the fines are converted into imprisonment, three yuan shall be calculated as one day, and the time limit shall not exceed one year. The number of days of detention before the judgment is finalized shall be offset by two days for one day of imprisonment. Forty-eight pounds of opium and car number 11689 shall be confiscated.</p>

<p>Requesting Exemption from Autumn Vehicle Tax</p>
<p>Municipal Government Directives Approved</p>
<p>The China Merchants Public Bus Company of this city, whose business scope is entirely in the Zhabei area, has been struggling to maintain transportation since the retreat of Japanese soldiers. It first restored the No. 3 route (North Station to Zhenru), while the No. 1 route (North Station to Jiangwan) has not yet been opened due to the fact that the Japanese soldiers stationed in Area D of 63 Huahui have just withdrawn and the Yokohama Bridge has not yet been repaired. All expenses rely solely on the income from the No. 3 route. However, due to the desolation after the war, the income from this route is also very meager, making it difficult to support the company. Therefore, it submitted a document to the Municipal Public Works Bureau a few days ago, requesting that the autumn vehicle tax be waived entirely to reduce expenses and alleviate the business's difficulties. Director Huang of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, believing that the company's statement was true, forwarded the request to the municipal government for instructions. Yesterday, the municipal government held a directive to the Public Works Bureau, stating, "Noted. Since the China Merchants Public Bus Company claims that the business of Route 3 is meager and it is difficult to support it, which is true, it should be allowed to specifically exempt the vehicle tax for Route 3 for the autumn season of this year to show consideration. In addition to informing the Finance Bureau, you should also inform them."</p>

<p>Ye Bingchu's Situation is Pitiful</p>
<p>Ye Bingchu, a 37-year-old from Ningbo, who usually resides in his hometown, came to Shanghai on the 18th of this month and booked Room 16 at the Huibin Hotel on Shandong Road. On the 22nd, he suddenly secretly bought opium and committed suicide. Later, a tea waiter named Chen Jingxiong heard shouting outside his door, realized that something was wrong, and pushed the door open. He saw that Ye's face had changed drastically, white foam was coming from his mouth, and he was sleeping on the bed. The tea waiter immediately reported to the accounting room, which reported to the Laozha Police Station. Detectives were ordered to investigate and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died of poisoning at 5:20 yesterday morning. The body was taken to the Ferren Road Mortuary. At around 10:00, Zhan Liangce, prosecutor of the First Special District Court, was commissioned to come to the mortuary to examine the body and sit in court. According to Wang Bingzhong's statement, he resides at No. 17 Jinhua Street and runs a cigarette shop. The deceased was his cousin. He did not know about it at the time. Later, someone told him that he had poisoned himself. His wife died of illness last year, and his son died this spring. He came to Shanghai to look for a job, but there was no suitable occupation. He met with him a few days ago, and during the conversation, he heard him express resentment. Unexpectedly, he would poison himself. After receiving the statement, Mr. Zhan ordered the examination to confirm that the deceased, Ye Bingchu, had indeed died from opium poisoning. The body was handed over to his cousin, Wang Bingzhong, who signed an undertaking to take it back for coffin burial.</p>

A certain gentleman visited the chief physicians of the hospital, Liu Peihua and Wang Jihui, yesterday and learned that in less than a month since the opening, the number of patients has reached more than 900, and dozens of patients with epidemic diseases and poisoning have been rescued. Recently, due to the hot weather, the number of patients seeking treatment has increased even more, resulting in an unusually busy daily workload. It is also learned that because the hospital is located in the western suburbs of Shanghai, in a workers' area, in order to facilitate general laborers to seek medical treatment after work, the consultation time is extended every afternoon, and an official letter has been sent to various factories in the western suburbs of Shanghai the day before yesterday, so that general poor laborers can also enjoy the convenience of free medical treatment.</p>

<p>To the Editor, I am writing to you because I read in the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 25th regarding two articles, "Commander Resigns and Remains," and "Military Law Review to Hear a Large Number of Communists on a Regular Basis," which were said to be statements issued by Chen Hanzu of the Military Law Review. After investigation, I have not met with any correspondents or reporters recently, nor have I made any such statements. Moreover, since the martial law in Shanghai, the Military Law Review has sent all undecided cases to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for handling in accordance with Article 7 of the Emergency Punishment Law. It has not yet resumed operations. The case of hearing a large number of communists on a regular basis is even more inconsistent with the facts. I hereby request a correction. Respectfully yours, Chen Hanzu, July 25.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I am writing to you regarding the news "The Municipal Government Passes the Reduction and Exemption of Field Taxes in the War Zone" published in the "Local News" section of your newspaper on July 24. The third item of the consultation results of the three bureaus of land, finance, and society, "The remaining districts, except for the two districts of South Shanghai and Pusong, plan to generally reduce the busy season tax by 20%," should be ""The two districts of South Shanghai and Pusong plan to generally reduce the busy season tax by 20%." Please correct it accordingly. Sincerely, Propaganda Section of the Second Department of the Shanghai Municipal Government, July 25.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I am writing to you because I read in today's newspaper a local news article about the establishment of a temporary post office by the Shanghai-Japan Consulate after the postal blockade in the Northeast. I was very surprised to read it. After investigation, this record is completely untrue and may easily cause misunderstandings among Chinese and foreigners. Together, I urgently send a letter to ensure that your newspaper quickly corrects it and publishes this letter so that it can be widely known and show the facts. This is where I feel grateful. Sincerely, Consulate General of Japan in Shanghai, July 25. To the Editor, I am writing to you regarding the article "Division Commander Fan Shisheng Injured and Comes to Shanghai" published in your newspaper recently. After investigation, the reporter of the Guowen News Agency mistakenly took our Division Commander "Shaozeng" and Division Commander Fan "Shisheng" as one person. In fact, our Division Commander's name commonly used is "Shaozeng," and Division Commander Fan Shisheng is still alive and well in central Hubei at this moment. In addition, the biggest reason for our Division Commander's change of location for medical treatment this time is still the climate. Together, I make a statement for correction. Sincerely, Fan Zhongqu, July 25.</p>

<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Tan Zhi One Two</p>
<p>Under the shade of the green pagoda trees, a temporary club is organized: a rattan chair every five steps, a bamboo couch every ten steps. While family members chat idly, they inevitably guess a few riddles to help pass the summer heat.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, using this small garden surrounded by bamboo fences in "Free Talk" as our place to cool off after work; guessing riddles is indispensable for passing the time while relaxing. One | Two | Three | My riddles, like commands, consist of three in total.</p>
<p>First, who is it that sings the tune of a tyrannical emperor when the scorching sun is overhead?</p>
<p>|| This tyrannical emperor is not a real emperor. It would be wrong to guess Puyi.</p>
<p>Second, if a certain idiom from the Zuo Zhuan were effective, then Chongguang's precious leg would never have been cut off. Now that Chongguang has become a one-legged Kui, it is clear that a certain idiom from the Zuo Zhuan is unreliable. What is this idiom called? || The idiom from Zuo Zhuan guarantees that Chongguang's leg would not be cut off. Those who have read Zuo Zhuan should be able to guess it easily.</p>
<p>Third, there is a five-character couplet that looks the same whether read forward or backward, called || Support Ma Yuan Support Ma Yuan. To match it with a lower line of the same nature, and also relevant to the current situation, what is this lower line called? || The "yuan" in "support Ma" accepts both level and oblique tones; now it is specified to be used as an oblique tone. Ma Yuan was a famous general, used as a metaphor for General Ma Zhanshan. You must also find an ancient person for these five characters, and also use them as a metaphor for a modern person. This kind of antithesis is unique and resembles guessing riddles.</p>
<p>Gentlemen cooling off, goodbye for now; after asking for a day, I will reveal the answers to you in this small garden.</p>
<h3 id="e147">A Eulogy for Ye Huijun <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Wanxuan</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Huijun, a prominent figure in the business world, was loyal, courageous, and upright. He made great contributions to the recovery of Shanghai during the Xinhai Revolution. Without the strength of the merchant corps at that time, the capture of Shanghai could not have been achieved so quickly. Otherwise, Nanjing could not have been captured quickly, and the Qing court's reinforcements would have driven down from Jiangpu, making the situation critical and hopeless. A single mistake could have ruined everything. Mr. Ye truly contributed to the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Later, when Xiangcheng (Yuan Shikai) declared himself emperor, he feared that Mr. Ye would be a thorn in his side and offered a reward for his capture. Therefore, Mr. Ye fled to Japan, enduring hardship. After returning to China, he did not consider himself one of the revolutionary pioneers because of this. He devoted himself to business and had no intention of pursuing an official career. However, wherever justice lay, he rushed to it eagerly. He never shirked from local public welfare, no matter how much toil or complaint it entailed. Although he was already over seventy years old, he still served society tirelessly. Now, the sad news has arrived that Mr. Ye suddenly passed away from an abdominal tumor. His legacy is admired, but our thoughts are in vain. It truly makes one feel unbearable sorrow.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye had a sincere nature and treated people and handled affairs with utmost sincerity. However, he held strict views and would directly criticize others' wrongdoings, even in crowded places. Honest words are harsh to the ear, and some people resented him for this. However, on the day after Mr. Ye's death, many of those who had held grudges against him came to pay their respects. Some even wept loudly, showing how deeply Mr. Ye moved people.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye was born posthumously and came from a poor family with no means for schooling. At the age of fourteen, he came to Shanghai to learn the rice business. He was respectful, diligent, and devoted to his work. In his spare time, he studied diligently. Even at his advanced age, he still practiced calligraphy and read every morning without fail. Regarding his integrity and honesty, never taking even the smallest thing improperly, the people of Shanghai all know this. It is remembered that a certain influential figure sent someone with generous gifts. Mr. Ye firmly refused to accept them, and the servant insisted that Mr. Ye accept them, even arguing back. Mr. Ye then angrily tied him outside the door. Those who heard of this all praised it as a fine story.</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Ye's abdominal tumor lasted for three months. Before that, the government convened a National Crisis Conference in Luoyang, and Mr. Ye was also invited to be a member. At that time, he had been ill for many days. His family tried to dissuade him, but he would not listen. After struggling to go to the capital, he collapsed in an inn. So he returned to Shanghai, but his illness had already become terminal. He went to Guangci</p>
<p>Hospital for treatment. The French director, who was skilled in medicine, said that there was a newly invented radium therapy that could cure Mr. Ye's illness, but the fee was as high as two thousand gold coins. Mr. Ye had no way to pay it, and he was unwilling to receive treatment because the consultation fee was so high. His sons ran around in many ways, but they were unable to raise the full amount in time. Furthermore, Mr. Ye insisted on leaving the hospital, so he returned without receiving treatment. Later, he was diagnosed and treated by Chinese and foreign doctors, but he was ultimately unable to recover.</p>
<p>When Mr. Ye was bedridden, he was sometimes delirious, and what he said was mostly about public welfare. One day, Mr. Wang Xiaolai went to visit him. Mr. Ye was in a state of semi-consciousness. Suddenly, he started talking about the city's municipal problems, speaking eloquently. Mr. Wang just responded with "yes, yes."</p>
<p>In summary, Mr. Ye devoted his life to the local area. Last year, he purchased several houses in Shanghai, which had almost exhausted his savings from seventy years of diligence and thrift. The construction cost was still several thousand yuan short, which his sons managed to raise to pay off. He had hoped to enjoy a peaceful old age in his later years, but heaven did not grant him that. The country and society have lost a pillar, and we mourn him endlessly.</p>

<p>— Huang Ren</p>
<p>Forget Your Toothache Toothaches are a disease that everyone fears. Once it starts to hurt, it's worse than being executed. Although there are dentists to consult, the difficulties of extracting or filling teeth also make people tremble with fear. That</p>
<p>Twenty minutes on the reclining chair is like a death row inmate sitting in an electric chair. But now, a British dentist has come up with a great idea to make you forget your toothache. He has you sit in his reclining chair, and immediately a small screen is placed where your eyes can see it. Then, Charlie Chaplin, Rock, and Pescator appear on the screen one by one, making all kinds of ridiculous and funny movements, causing you to laugh involuntarily from the bottom of your heart. For a moment, you forget about your toothache. He takes this opportunity to put the little gadget in your mouth and forcefully pulls out your bad tooth. You don't even feel it at all. Isn't this method good news for toothache comrades?</p>
<p>Speed-loving Women In mid-June of this year, two British female race car experts will compete with several male race car experts in a 1,000-mile race at Brooklands to determine who is the best. This is a recent shocking event in the sports world. From our observation, modern women generally love speed. Three years ago, a noblewoman, Mrs. V. Bruce, ran 2,150 miles in 24 hours, averaging 89.57 miles per hour, breaking the world record. She got tired of playing with race cars and started playing with airplanes. She made several long-distance flights and even circumnavigated the world by plane and mail ship. She truly deserves to be called a heroine.</p>
<p>Mrs. M.T. Hickey, America's most famous speedboat expert, was a sickly person three years ago. The most painful thing was neurasthenia, which even doctors couldn't cure. One day, she sat on the riverbank watching men compete in speedboat races and became very excited. She asked her husband to buy her a speedboat. The first time she got on the boat, she was so weak that she needed help getting on. But now, she is a famous speedboat racer in the New World.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Rat Thief <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Zhuoming</p>
<p>The world is deteriorating, and people's hearts are not as good as before. Cases of theft are heard every day, and the techniques are becoming increasingly strange. Exhausting all possibilities, I heard a friend talk about a rat thief case yesterday. The thief was able to use chemistry to commit theft. This is a novel incident and worth recording.</p>
<p>In a certain town in Zhongshan County, Guangdong, there was a pawnshop with considerable capital and good business. Last month, it suddenly reported a theft. The pawnshop had strict defenses, so it was suspected that it was not an outside thief. A certain partner, Mr. Jia, was in charge of guarding the warehouse and had an opium addiction. Everyone suspected him, but they couldn't dismiss him without cause. While investigating, another theft occurred.</p>
<p>The pawnshop had a secret ditch that led to a secluded street behind it. One day, the owner of the pawnshop passed by the area and suddenly saw a huge rat carrying a bag, wriggling out of the ditch. He found it strange and caught it. He opened the bag, and it was full of items from the pawnshop. While he was wondering, Mr. Jia suddenly tiptoed over. The pawnshop owner understood and confronted him. The case was revealed.</p>
<p>Initially, Mr. Jia kept a rat and was very fond of it. When he was smoking opium, he jokingly gave it water that had been used to wipe his smoking utensils. Over time, it became addicted and had to drink it every day, just like a person with an addiction. Mr. Jia's opium addiction was very deep, and his income was not enough to cover his expenses. So he took a risk and thought about stealing from the pawnshop. However, according to the rules of the pawnshop in that area, those guarding the warehouse had to be inspected by the pawnshop owner when entering and exiting, so there was no way to carry anything out. He happened to see the rat's opium addiction acting up and came up with this plan. First, he brought the rat to the pawnshop and released it into the ditch, and placed water mixed with opium at the exit of the ditch behind the pawnshop. He led it to drink. Then, he tied the stolen goods to its back. When the rat's addiction acted up, it would carry the bag out to drink, and the theft was accomplished.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Worth Recommending National Product Factories (10) <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>Soda is an essential item for washing away oil stains. The native soda that China used in the past was produced in Shandong and other places. Since the import of foreign soda, native soda has gradually been abandoned by the Chinese. Later, more and more soda factories were established by Chinese in Shanghai. As a result, foreigners only import soda ash for making soda, and block soda is no longer imported. To date, there are eight soda factories in Shanghai. The larger ones include Henry on Xiaojiu Hua Street, Lida on Zhangjiabang in Pudong, Yongmaoxiang on Limapu Road in Nanshi, and Taikang on Tangshan Road.</p>
<p>Soda is bought by the square, each square weighing about 130 catties. The market price is over five foreign yuan. The total annual sales in Shanghai are worth about 400,000 foreign yuan.</p>
<p>Soda ash is mostly sold by the British company Bunneman in Shanghai. Those made by Chinese themselves include Yongli Company in Tianjin, which is currently managed by Jiuda Refined Salt Company on Baike Road in Shanghai. The market price is about seven taels and several qian of silver per dan, and the price of foreign goods is similar. According to people in the industry, domestic goods are actually better than foreign goods when compared. The reason is that soda ash is like cement. If it is exposed to wind and moisture, it will lose its effectiveness. Bunneman powder is shipped from abroad, and careless handling can often reduce its leavening power. Domestic goods are easier to obtain, so there is no need to worry about exposure to moisture. Its manufacturing</p>
<p>Its manufacturing is done by hand. For every 100 catties of soda ash, 30 catties of cleansing powder (i.e., baking soda) are mixed in with water. After mixing, it is poured into a square frame made of giant tinplate. The frame must be detachable, otherwise, it will not be easy to remove it after it solidifies. The market price of cleansing powder is about eleven taels of silver per dan, excluding foreign goods.</p>
<p>(10) (8) Candle Factory</p>
<p>The raw material for candles is only paraffin (i.e., extracted from kerosene). It is melted in a pot to a certain degree and poured into tinplate molds. Candle wicks are pre-placed in the molds. After it solidifies, it becomes a candle. Large-sized ones can produce 80 candles at a time, while small-sized ones can only produce 40. Shanghai has three factories that manufacture candle wicks: Sanyou and Samsung are the most famous. Each package of 2,000 feet costs about one foreign yuan. As for paraffin, it is exclusively managed by the foreign company Asia Petroleum Company. The market price is over 20 foreign yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Candles are wholesaled by the box, with six candles per tube. The weight varies, but 12 taels is common. Each box contains 25 tubes. The market price per box for those weighing 12 taels is about four foreign yuan. The larger candle factories in Shanghai include Henry on Xiaojiu Hua Street, Nanyang on Lapa Bridge, and Huali on Laiyi Wharf. Last year, their sales of candles each totaled around 70,000 to 80,000 boxes. Others, such as Nanxie Xing and Hengxingyu on Limapu Road, Liantai Xin (i.e., Wuzhou Candle Factory) on Xinzha Road, Lida in Pudong, Qinchang in Hongkou, and Yuqingfeng in Dongjiadu, are also well-known. In total, there are nine candle factories in Shanghai. However, the sales of British Baileishi candles in China increase year by year, with annual sales of three to four million yuan, which is quite alarming.</p>

<p>Sixty-two</p>
<p>Today is a particularly interesting day. We held a particularly interesting meeting called a planning meeting. Today, the children jointly decided on a plan for the year's work.</p>
<p>The children didn't quite understand this meeting at first. Yu'er said, "Today there's a chrysanthemum meeting at the school." Chunxiang said, "No, it's a chicken flower meeting." Mr. Zhu finally had to explain what a plan was. "Children! How many meals do you want to eat a day?" Ying'er said, "Three meals." Wang'er said, "I want to eat four meals." Mr. Zhu said, "Okay, Ying'er's eating plan is three meals a day; Yu'er's eating plan is four meals a day." Xiao San said, "I understand, is the planning meeting an eating meeting?" Mr. Zhu said, "Eating is an important thing, we must put eating in the plan. But what else do you have to do besides eating?" Qiu'er said, "Reading, writing." Lan Hua said, "; There's also sweeping the floor, cooking." Baozhu said, "Practicing boxing." Yang'er said, "Playing, sleeping." A'er said, "Peeing, pooping can also be considered important things, right?" Mr. Zhu said</p>
<p>: "They are important things, you must have a bowel movement every day. If you don't have a bowel movement for a day, you'll have nightmares at night, and you'll feel uncomfortable. Pooping is a very important thing." Everyone laughed. Mr. Zhu continued, "We write down all the things we do in a day, eating, reading, writing, sweeping the floor, cooking, practicing boxing, sleeping, playing, peeing, pooping, and when we do what, how many hours or how much of what we do, then it becomes a day's plan. Qiu'er - tell me your day's plan." Qiu'er said, "Three meals, two big bowls each meal, half an hour of planting, one hour of woodworking, one hour of Chinese, one hour of arithmetic, half an hour of writing, one hour of playing science tricks, half an hour of sweeping the house, one hour of practicing boxing, ten hours of sleeping, two hours of playing, one time pooping, peeing is uncertain." Mr. Zhu said, "This is Qiu'er's day's plan. Although he has left out many things, it is indeed a plan. A plan is to write down a list of the things we want to do so that we can see it often, so that we don't do this and forget that. We advocate what kind of life we live is what kind of education we receive: living a planned life is considered receiving a planned education: living an unplanned life is considered receiving an unplanned education. Speaking of plans: there is a plan for one day, a plan for one month, a plan for one year, a plan for three years, a plan for ten years, a plan for a lifetime, what we children should do in this year, how much each thing should be done, must be planned out, so that we are not rushed. Okay, let's make a year's plan for the ancient temple children."</p>

<h3 id="e152">Young Maids and the Class System <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Yesterday's article in this publication, "The Pitiful Ah K," described the situation of an underage maid being seduced by the young master, and then being fired by the mistress upon discovery, who scolded her as "rotten goods." The maid could only leave in shame and tears. Such incidents are common in aristocratic families. This is an abstract way of putting it.</p>
<p>But such incidents are extremely unfair in terms of reason and justice. A pure and innocent young maid is clearly seduced by her son, yet instead of making her a member of the family or compensating her for the loss, she is fired and called "rotten goods." And on the maid's side, it's as if she shouldn't have tried to climb up to the young master, as if she, a lowly person, has committed an egregious crime that she ought to repent for. This kind of oppressed mentality and the harsh methods of capitalists are often like this.</p>
<p>As for the marriage system, although there are no class restrictions in law, in the minds of most corrupt people, the invisible class system is stricter than legal regulations. Officials must marry officials, and the wealthy must marry the wealthy in order to be considered "well-matched." Otherwise, they laugh at wealthy families for losing their status, or laugh at poor families for shamelessly climbing the social ladder.</p>
<p>In the Republic of China, all people are supposed to be equal. The so-called poverty and wealth are just distinctions between having money and not having money. Lowliness and nobility are just distinctions between being lucky and unlucky. What other differences are there? As for round heads and square feet, ears, eyes, noses, and everything else, they are the same. Why is it that a young maid cannot marry the young master, and the young master cannot marry the young maid?</p>
<p>I'll go a step further and say that wealthy families must marry poor families, and noble families must marry lowly families. If this were the case, then wealth, nobility, poverty, and lowliness could be evenly distributed. Those in poverty and lowliness would be endlessly grateful. If you are already wealthy and marry wealth, it is redundant. If you are already poor and marry poverty, it's like adding frost to snow. This is a bad habit of our country. If we don't break this bad habit first, the class system in society will never be eradicated!</p>

<p>— Xiao Chang</p>
<p>I resent the meddling spring breeze, blowing up the proud sun from the east sea. Fragrant grasses vainly grow green in the three paths, the delicate peach blossoms sadly illuminate a pond of red. I idly talk of Zhang Xu's palace willows, only Cai Yong cherishes the withered wutong trees. All day long, I sing sorrowful songs as a substitute for weeping, a white-haired old man bitterly chanting at the edge of the world.</p>
<p>Second Poem</p>
<p>Gazing far over the plains, the grasses are lush. Embroidered rivers and mountains are trampled by iron hooves. The cuckoo's mournful cries are heard in Hebei, the oriole's songs have no dreams of reaching western Liaoning. On the battlefield, I will pity the blooming flowers one day. In the bustling city, I now listen to ghostly wails. Where can I find the past of Taicheng? The green willow embankments are deeply locked in the smoke of war.</p>
<p>Third Poem</p>
<p>The Southern Dynasties were like a dream, vying for extravagance. Now I hate the past mistakes that cannot be redeemed. One must learn from the generals and be called a great tree, and not greedily watch famous flowers in Luoyang. At this time, thorns grow in the courtyard. In the past, brave soldiers were like claws and teeth. When the raging waves are stemmed by the collective effort, how many people will wander about, lamenting that they have no home?</p>

<h3 id="e154">Methods for Cleaning Clothes <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Tan Guanhan</p>
<p>The hot weather easily causes people to produce sweat. If you are not diligent in cleaning, the sweat secreted from the skin will stick to the clothes, and an unpleasant odor will evaporate. No one welcomes this kind of odor, even oneself will feel uncomfortable. Secondly, clothes are worn on the body, so you can't use special care to protect them. During banquets, beside desks, or when it rains, on muddy roads, and so on, if you are not careful, you will inevitably get tea stains, meat juice, ink, paint, mud, paint, and other unexpected and unsightly stains. At that time, wouldn't you feel deeply unpleasant? Therefore, the method of cleaning clothes is probably something that readers would like to hear about.</p>
<p>Usually, the detergents for clothes are mostly soap, because the raw materials of soap are made of things like fat and sodium. When it encounters water, it emits fatty acid salts and alkali. The acidic salt is a smooth protobody that can help with washing. Alkali is a free protobody that can separate the dirt on the clothes and dissolve it in water.</p>
<p>However, although soap is the best detergent, there are a few things to pay attention to when using it. (1) Ordinary soaps sold on the market have different prices, but a cheap soap that costs twice as much cannot match the effectiveness of half a piece of expensive soap. The distinction between them is only two types: hard and soft. The former is a superior type, and the latter is an inferior type. (2) Washing clothes with soap seems very simple, but in fact, the water is also very important when washing. Using hot water is better than using cold water, because the washing effect of hot water is much stronger than cold water, which can make the soap liquid penetrate into the fibers of the clothes and easily remove dirt. (3) In the interior of the country - where there is no tap water, you must recognize the different degrees of hardness of the water. Rainwater, river water, and lake water are soft, and spring water, sea water, and well water are hard. Soap detergent is most suitable for soft water, otherwise, it will generate a kind of neutral sodium salt or potassium salt and calcium salt of fatty acid, which can reduce the washing effect.</p>
<p>Clothes that have been used for a long time often cannot be as white as new again, so you have to use a bleaching method. There are three types of bleaching agents, such as bleaching powder, chlorine white, and hydrogen peroxide, but usually bleaching powder is used. When using it, first soak the material to be bleached in cold water, then pour a spoonful of bleaching powder into half a basin of clean water, mix it evenly, and then take the clear bleaching liquid and pour it into the basin containing the clothes, and then soak the clothes again. After one hour, take it out, wring it dry, soak it in dilute hydrochloric acid for about half an hour, then take it out, wring it dry, soak it in sodium hyposulfite for about ten minutes, take it out, rinse it thoroughly with clean water, and after drying, it will return to its former glory. (Regarding the method of making bleaching powder, I will describe it in another article when I have time, but it is also available in pharmacies, so it is very easy to buy and use.)</p>

<h3 id="e156">Suggestions from the Society for Improving Social Customs on Reforming Marriage Customs <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Kangshi</p>
<p>Marriage: is inevitable for everyone, and is one of the biggest problems in life, simply to seek happiness. However, our country's customs are extremely superficial and conventional, and the recent social trends have become even more extravagant. According to the current expenses of marriage, the poor need at least a thousand gold, as for the rich, it can be several thousands or even tens of thousands of gold. Their psychology embraces vanity and a desire to surpass others, showing off their glory with lavish scenes, but they do not investigate whether they can achieve true happiness. Therefore, the rich create the trend, and the poor follow suit, losing the true meaning of marriage as a pursuit of happiness, and instead suffering endless future troubles.</p>
<p>We see that the marriages of the poor in society, influenced by the trend of extravagance, have no choice but to drink poison to quench their thirst, whether it be selling their belongings, incurring debts, going bankrupt, or committing suicide due to economic pressure, they go to extremes. Alas! This kind of evil custom, under the current state of national decline and impoverishment, cannot be allowed to continue, and urgent reform should be sought quickly. Here are three aspects within my limited view, listed below.</p>
<p>(1) The Dowry Should Be Abolished. The most important thing in our country's marriage customs is the dowry, simply hoping for the praise of relatives and friends, and the compliments of neighbors, which is all meaningless. And the meaningless "lucky money" given to the moving workers also costs a lot. Therefore, in my humble opinion, the dowry should be abolished, and the furniture should be purchased by the man himself, which can save the arguments about the thickness of the dowry, and can also save a lot of unnecessary money.</p>
<p>(2) Reciprocal Congratulatory Gifts and Wedding Banquets Should Be Abolished. When relatives and friends have marriage matters, of course, they congratulate each other with money or gifts, and the host throws a large banquet. What is the meaning of this reciprocal socializing? The congratulator gives a congratulatory gift and gets a cup of wedding wine, and the host receives some gifts and invites the congratulators to eat wedding wine. Both gifts and wedding wine are wasted, with no real benefit. Therefore, in my humble opinion, it should be abolished. On the wedding day, some refreshments should be prepared to thank the relatives and friends who attended the ceremony, so that both parties will not spend money.</p>
<p>(3) Should Be Economical and Simple. According to today's living standards, all the expenses and ceremonies of marriage should be economical and simple, and the wasteful and superficial ones should be thoroughly abolished, seeking happiness in reality.</p>
<p>Are the above three points appropriate? I would also like to ask the wise to discuss it. However, worldly customs are difficult to break. We poor scholars sing loudly, but if there are no adults and gentlemen to promote it, what effect will it have? However, the bone is stuck in the throat, and I have to spit it out!</p>
<h3 id="e157">Discussion on Improvement <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Huanhua</p>
<p>Recently, the editor of this journal advocated a society for improving social customs, which is indeed in line with the needs of modern society and a major mission for newspapers.</p>
<p>However, the word "improvement" is a good thing to say, of course, it is to correct the malpractices of the deformed society and the imperfect society, and bring them back to the good track. However, in a vague sense, criminal improvement and illegal improvement are also called improvement. Such improvement, although the name is still improvement, actually changes the well-intentioned goodness.</p>
<p>Now let's take a few examples to talk about it: (1) Several newspapers in Shanghai are also singing loudly about improving society, among which some advocate improving women's fashionable dresses, which can cultivate women's psychology of extravagance and bad habits, and the resulting moral degradation, economic pressure, family changes, and other malpractices, are countless. Some also advocate improving cigarettes. From the industrial standpoint, it can be said that there is a need to promote benefits and eliminate harms. However, for the sake of smokers, it hinders development, damages the brain, and wastes money. Is it necessary to improve it? (2) The lethal weapons used to kill people in various countries are now actively researching and improving. What does this improvement mean? Japan is also actively researching and improving Manchukuo. What does this transformation mean? (3) There is a popular play on the stage called "Improving the New Killing of Sons." Killing sons and wanting to improve, this is truly a groundbreaking improvement. Extending this to the current society, cases of adultery, theft, and murder are constantly emerging, so why can't it be said to be improvement? Even the recent inhuman act of dogs copulating with humans is also the result of Chen Xin's improvement!</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who wants to discuss improving society must try their best to stand on the side of good. When you think of a new problem and propose a new method, it must be able to bring real benefits to society, family, and individuals, and then it can be called improvement, and then it will not fail the hard work of the editor of this journal in setting up the society, and then it can make the depressed and hopeless people gain some welfare.</p>
<p>Let's try to base ourselves on the past arguments of this journal: it advocates science and improves technology to seek the popularization of industries with backward production. Exposing the inside story and punishing the people to seek the fundamental overthrow of the sinful society. Studying the evolution of social groups and family systems to adapt to the timely production of trends is a great mission. How great is this improvement, how beautiful and good is this, this is exactly the editor's hint to the readers of the discussion society, this is also a bright path for the readers of the discussion society. However, inferring other things from one instance is up to the readers' efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Discussion on Improving Family Economy <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Ouyang Jinping</p>
<p>With a good economy, there is a good family. Otherwise, the husband will have a worrisome burden, the wife will sigh with skill, and the children will cry for food. The environment is forced, and there is no peace. Therefore, the family economy must be carefully studied. Moreover, in this era of rice as pearls and firewood as cassia, if we do not know how to improve the economy, how can the family be prosperous? Here are some of my views, written below.</p>
<p>Hold a family affairs meeting every year to discuss economic issues.</p>
<p>Allocate the income of salary and wages in a complete way. For example, if the annual income is one thousand yuan, then allocate it as follows.</p>
<p>A. Food expenses account for two-tenths</p>
<p>B. Room rent expenses account for two-tenths</p>
<p>C. Clothing expenses account for one-tenth</p>
<p>D. Self-study and entertainment expenses account for one-twentieth</p>
<p>E. Miscellaneous and pocket money (for furniture, medical treatment, condolences, etc.) account for one-tenth</p>
<p>F. Education expenses account for one and a half-tenths</p>
<p>G. Savings expenses account for two-tenths</p>
<p>And order family members to pay attention to the rules of thrift.</p>
<p>(1) Men and women in the family should work together and not sit idly, in order to save the cost of employing servants.</p>
<p>(2) If the clothes are not damaged, it is not appropriate to sew new clothes again. The remaining money should be saved for interest, or to prevent accidents and increase room rent.</p>
<p>(3) Do not set foot in entertainment venues on non-holiday rest days, so as to avoid excessive spending.</p>
<p>(4) Do not spend a penny on superstitious trivialities.</p>
<p>(5) Charitable donations should be donated as much as possible with the accumulated interest from the savings item.</p>
<p>(6) Old and young in the family should abstain from smoking and drinking to save unnecessary expenses.</p>

This court issued Notice No. 6 on July 14 of this year, stating that ten pieces of real estate owned by Huang Chu Jiu would be publicly auctioned at 9:00 am on July 30 in the Civil Execution Court of this court. Now, the liquidators Wu Wei and Pan Qibang, the two accountants, and the lawyers representing the creditor groups and the agent of Huang Chu Jiu's family, Tan Yigong, etc., claimed that the auction on July 30 was too rushed and requested that the auction date be extended by one month (i.e., extended to 9:00 am on August 30 for public auction) so that those who want to buy the real estate can bid in a leisurely manner. In addition to the court's order, this is specially announced (above July 25).</p>
