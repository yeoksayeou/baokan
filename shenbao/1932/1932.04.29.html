<h3 id="c1">再論郵資加價 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 翰</p>
<p>郵資加價一事。前嘗稍稍論及，自郵政管理權收回以後，業務反日見虧損。論者皆謂爲當局措置失當所致。然因業務虧損之故。而即欲藉加價以爲彌補。則其措置更爲失當。據其加價計劃。除報紙以外。各種郵件。加價均重。而以書籍與印刷品爲尤甚。不顧人民之呼籲。不惜阻礙文化前途之進展。毅然決定實行。且據二十七日中央電稱。「總局以此案經行政院決定。今已由郵局通告國際郵聯會。不便變更原議。」則可見當局之一意孤行。雖人民反對之文電。多如雪片。亦將置之不問矣。</p>
<p>按郵資加價之不合理。論者已詳言之。吾人可不必多贅。惟當局宣傳。以加價經行政院之決定。不便變更爲言。則其理由。至不可解。夫郵資加價。影響於人民之負擔與文化之阻滯者甚鉅。是否交通部少數人之主張。以及行政院一紙命令。即可視爲鐵律而不能變動。實一大可研究之問題。現代國家。凡關於加重人民負擔之行政案。行政當局僅能準備方案。向立法當局提出建議而已。今交通當局。僅恃行政院一紙命令爲護符。而即逕行加價。事前旣未經立法院之通過。事後我國民亦無從施以監督。則國家立法院之設。所爲何事耶。當局須知以新命令取消舊命令。變更原議。藉附輿情。於法理事實。均無不便之處。否則一旦實行。人民堅決反對。又將成一糾紛問題矣。</p>
<p>至所謂加價辦法。已通知國際郵聯會。未便收回云云。其理由更不充分。夫加價辦法。事前旣未經立法院之通過。即以通知國際郵聯會。其手續之不合法。至爲明顯。此種事實之救濟。解鈴繫鈴。仍在當局。當局而確已通知國際郵聯會。亦未嘗不可設法撤回。且國際間事實性質之重要。尚有倍於此者。如國際所訂條約往往先經政府代表簽訂。而後再經議會通過。茍議會加以否決。則所訂條約即可等於廢紙。政府代表之對外行爲。事後尚可設法撤銷。獨對於郵資加價之一紙通告。竟遂無法撤回之耶。</p>
<p>中央電所傳。固尚難窺測當局之眞意。茍當局確欲以此種「木已成舟」之說法。搪塞人民。則斷非我人所敢贊許。況人民之反對。實有深長之理由。若書業公會之要求。處處爲文化前途着想。絕非爲單純利己之企圖。否則書籍之郵資加價與否。其負擔本可由購書者任之。何勞書業之喋喋爲也。竊願當局再虛心採納各方面之意見。深思而熟慮之</p>

<p>。</p>
<p>日內瓦空氣又緊張</p>
<p>小國代表態度激昂</p>
<p>日政府已訓令棄權</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十八日日內瓦電云、國聯特別大會、原定五月初召集、乃自該會主席希孟與秘書長德魯蒙會晤之後、似已改於後日午前召集、蓋恐十九委員會、關於行將採取之決定、無充分權力故也、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯廿八日日內瓦電云、十九委員會、將造具報告、呈送國聯特別大會、此項報告、對於上海談判、及滿洲事件均有記載、十九委員會、擬於明晨開會審查之</p>
<p>國民社二十八日日內瓦電云、今晨日內瓦空氣、復見緊張、各小國代表間紛傳日本仍未能無保留接受十九國委員會修正後之決議案、因此立即主張、於星期六或下星期一、重開國聯大會、但國聯中人逆料今日下午五時、十九國委員會舉行秘密會議時、各大國將利用其勢力、以謀轉換形勢、又據擁護國聯者聲稱、設所傳日本不能無保留接受決議案之消息果確、則局勢將變爲國聯預聞遠東時局以來最嚴重之一日、並謂前此各國、幾經斡旋後、將達妥協之際、僅因最後一分鐘之保留、而被推翻者已不祇一次云、</p>
<p>國民社二十七日日內瓦電云、今夜國聯中人對於日本接受英使藍溥森之折衷方式　雖覺滿意、但仍雜有憤慨之情緒、因日本仍拒絕與十九國委員會合作、今夜日代表長岡通知總秘書德魯蒙、聲稱、日本旣已接受新方式、十九國委員會再有任何討論、日本必須拒絕參加云、、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日內瓦電云十九國特委會定於今晚五時、舉行非公開會議、但非秘密的、以聆主席希孟報告、關於上海休戰之草案進行情形、日代表對於草案之第八項與第十三項之異議、現未堅持、故僅第十一項受有影響、今將以上海新方案之內容代之、當十九國特委會集議時、聞仍需機謀、以事策進、始可保一帆風順、蓋日本對於藍使提出之新方案、雖表示同意、而仍反對列入國聯大會決議案中、其所持之理由、爲休戰應在上海辦理之事與日內瓦無關云中政府則非俟十九國特委會決議案經日本接受後、殊不欲坦然重開休戰談判、日代表團現復向東京請訓、但國聯中人皆料日本未必更改態度、</p>
<p>路透社二十八日東京電云、今日據某要津消息、國聯之決議召集大會、通過關於上海休戰之決議案、將今日政府處於困難地位、其故因案中有數點、爲日本所反對、故日政府現正計議、應否命其代表屆時不必投票、或附保留而加贊同、惟日政府對於上海談判之進行、不欲有所梗阻云、</p>
<p>日聯社二十八日東京電云、據外務省本日接到日代表長岡電報、十九國委員會議長希孟與國聯秘書長特拉蒙商議之</p>
<p>結果、決定三十日召開國聯大會、審議決議草案、並決定正式決議、蓋十九國特別委員會之決議、不能拘束國聯諸國也、日本政府原來堅持委員會決議不能拘束日本之說、故國聯大會之決議內容、若與委員會之決議相同、則日本決不能贊成、祇有如下三種方法、一棄權、二投反對票、三投保留的贊成票、但棄權一項因日本曾於三月十一日國聯大會　棄權之結果、發生問題、今次似由第二第三方法之中擇一、</p>
<p>電通社二十八日東京電云、十九國委員會主席希孟、昨與德魯蒙秘書長協議後、突然決定於三十日上午、開國聯總會、已決定採取十九國委員會之決議草案、爲總會之決議案、本日已由日代表電達日外務省、其決定之理由係（一）十九國委員會並無中日兩方代表、故委員會之決議不能拘束日本、（二）反之若係總會決議、設日本放棄投票、但在法律上爲有效、故能拘束日本、（三）總會對十九國以外之聯盟國、將與以陳述意見之機會云云、</p>
<p>電通社二十八日東京電云、日外相芳澤今日下午召集外務首腦部協議結果、決定之根本方針如下、（一）在國聯總會、日代表出席說明停戰交涉之經過、及對十九國委員會案之日本之態度、（二）對採取決議案、決定棄權、因有關國聯再開之事務局之正式通告、故已訓電日代表、</p>

<p>特會決議草案</p>
<p>外部昨非正式發表</p>
<p>南京外部、昨以日方對英使折衷辦法、業　經接受、特訓令情報司、將國聯此次決議草案、非正式發表茲錄如下、</p>
<p>決議草案內容　國聯特別委員會決議草案、昨外部非公式發表如下、（一）查國聯議會三月四日及十一日之決議案、建議中日代表、從事談判、由上海租界享受利益之各國文武海陸當局協助、以期議定確實停戰及規定日軍撤退之辦法、（二）查三月四日及十一日議會決議案所波及之停戰撤兵辦法、雖僅能於當地議定之、因而特別委員會不能取談判者而自代、但出席停戰談判之各參加國、在進行談判時、或實行上述停戰撤兵辦法時、如遇有重大困難、有權通知特別委員會、由特別委員會議會並受議會之監督解決之、（三）查停戰撤兵談判、應依據上述之議會決議而行、當事國之任何一方、不得堅持與上述決議相抵觸之條件、（四）又查悉、送交本委員會之停戰協定草案之條欵、業經雙方接受、（五）認爲此項條欵、均與上述決議案之精神相符、（六）特別察悉、依照第三條、日政府擔任履行將其軍隊撤回公共租界及虹口越界築路地帶、一如一九三二年一月二十八日事件以前之原狀、（七）聲言國聯議會三月四日及十一日決議案件精神、係日軍撤退、應於最近之將來履行、（八）聲言三月四日之決議案、須俟日軍完全撤退後、始爲完全遵行、（九）察悉協定草案規定、設立共同委員會、由中立國會員參加、以查明雙方軍隊之撤退、並對於日軍撤退之區域、協助辦理其組織及移交與中國警察、俾日軍一經撤退、中國警察、即行負職、（十）察悉該委員會依照其決定、用其認爲最善之方法、監視第一第二第三各條之實行、而第三條、規定日軍完全撤回、如一月廿八日事件以前之原狀、甚爲滿意、（十一）以爲協定草案附件第四號所規定、監視實行該協定第一第二第三各條之委員會、其權限包括有權於當事一方之請求時、宣言時機已到、日軍依理可以完全撤退、並希望委員會之決議、均能全體一致、但聲言倘不能全體一致時、則依照上述附件第四號之規定、任何決定、有過半數之表決、即爲合法、主席有取決權、（藍使提議之修改案、係加入停戰協定草案第四號、以爲特委會決議草案第十一項修改之根據、）（十二）懇切建議於當事者、雙方恢復現有停頓中之談判、俾得早日結束、並請在上海租界有特殊利益之各國政府、爲達目的、繼續斡旋、（十三）明白指明、倘不能按照三月四日及十一日決議案獲得的結束、則本問題必須再提出於議會、（十四）請求在上海租界有特殊利益之各國政府、將其由參加混合委員會代表所得之報告轉報國聯、</p>
<p>停戰會議</p>
<p>昨開非正式會</p>
<p>將英使所提折衷辦法</p>
<p>加入協定附件第四號</p>
<p>停戰會議、昨日下午三時在、英總領事館、舉行非正式會議、通過英公使藍溥森所提出之折衷辦法、我方本已決定、須俟國聯議會特別委員會通過決議案後、方能確定此間停戰會議再開日期、昨日午後、突然開會、則係臨時決定、其經過如次、自英使藍溥森提出折衷辦法後、中日兩國政府、已先後表示接受、并由其代表通知國聯、國聯方面認此足以打開上海停戰會議之僵局、故亦表示滿意、但此次國聯議會特別委員會所擬定之決議草案、係以停戰協定草案爲根據、故在手續上、必須將英使之折衷辦法、加入協定草案後、國聯特別委員會始可引爲根據、將該委員會之決議草案第十一條、予以修改、否則上海停戰會議、須待國聯特別委員會通過決議案後、始可繼續開會、而該委員會、又須待協定草案加入英使折衷辦法後、始可開會修改、其決議案、不啻又成一僵局、日內瓦方面、因此問題、遂由英外相西門折一要電致藍溥森公使、英使接電後、昨午、特偕美公使詹森、赴勞利育路、訪我首席代表郭泰祺、商議解決此種手續上之困難、遂決定於下午三時、在英總領事館、舉行非正式會議、出席代表、爲外交次長郭泰祺.日使重光葵.英使藍溥森.美使詹森.意代辦齊亞諾.法使代表勒格朗.及外交部情報司長張似旭.日使館書記官岡崎.雙方軍事代表、均未出席、會議兩小時、將中日雙方政府已經接受之英使折衷辦法、予以形式上之通過、並即加入停戰定附件第四號云、</p>

<p>國民社二十七日日內瓦電　今日法代表彭古、通知美國務卿史汀生與英相麥唐納、謂法總理泰狄歐因抱病、星期五未能來日內瓦、因此各方屬望之五大國會議、將爲之作罷、而各方對於德法妥洽之希望、爲之煙消霧散、史汀生與麥唐納此次常言、當此時期歐陸國家所能貢獻者、可比任何國家爲鉅、英美海軍俱已限制、其陸軍在目前亦可認爲實際上最少限度、因此意法之附從倫敦條約、及法德之妥協、俱認爲當今最切要之舉、</p>
<p>國民社二十七日日內瓦電　此間認法總理泰狄歐藉口抱病、中輟日內瓦之行、乃無意改變其對於軍縮賠欵及對德態度、故欲規避日內瓦之討論、以免受英美壓迫、蓋聞史汀生與麥唐納擬略施壓力於泰狄歐、使其保證法國贊助英美之從性質的軍縮理論、因茍法國能贊助此事、則軍縮會議可望得若干成功、如此便可希望美國在戰債問題、作若干讓步、今則以法總理之中止來日內瓦、各大國要人間之談話、亦爲之中輟、種種希望均付東流、意外相格蘭第聞亦通知此間、將仍留羅馬、中止日內瓦之行、而美國務卿亦將於明日啟程赴意、乘星期五自日諾瓦出發之意輪羅馬號遞紐約、史氏返國不取道於法而取道意國、此間認爲有重大意味、因據可靠消息、史汀生對於事態之經過、深覺失望、此蓋種局勢、足以打銷美國對於戰債讓步之一切希望也、英相麥唐納與德總理白魯寗亦將於明日啟程返國、德總理回國後、將應付一危急之局勢、因法國此種態度、將益增國家社會黨之勢力也、</p>

<p>國民社二十七日巴黎電　今夜發表法總理泰狄歐取銷日內瓦之行、及中止赴培爾福作選舉演說後、政界爲之一驚、據官廳發表、泰氏因勞瘁過度、致患喉頭炎醫生力對休養、謂即赴日內瓦、實際亦不克參加英美意德當軸之會議、故不得不暫時作罷、並竭力否認泰氏之病、含有外交性質、實因同時須處理國政、指揮選舉運動、及參加日內瓦會議過於勞瘁所致、</p>
<p>路透社二十七日巴黎電　法總理泰狄歐因患喉頭炎症、未能出外、現接美國務卿史汀生來電內稱、近在日內瓦彼此考慮之重要事件、未克重行集議、至以爲悵、渠因體氣關係未能久留於日內瓦、但日內瓦美代表團、將就其權力所能及者、以促成此次討論之精神、竭力進行其工作云、英相麥唐納亦電致泰狄歐、希望其早日痊愈、</p>

<p>路透社二十七日倫敦電　日內瓦電稱、英國某重要政治家在該處向各國新聞記者發言、謂英國認軍縮討論之進行、過於迂緩、使人失望、並謂英國或須考慮運用倫敦海軍條約、准許在指定限度上建築軍艦之條文云、法總理泰狄歐、刻不在日內瓦、泰患喉頭炎症、不得不稍事休養、衆意此種被迫的休養、未始非福、因可免除日內瓦公然之鈍挫也、泰氏現過其極忙之生活、不獨須在巴黎日內瓦作極重要外交談判、同時尚須在其選舉區貝爾福地方、作選舉競爭之運動、泰氏近在其選舉區小住六十小時、而費於露天大會演講者、佔四十五小時、今泰氏確有重被選出之望、雖暫抱恙、然不妨從其巴黎寓中指揮運動也、惟星期五日、泰氏未能在日內瓦與英相麥唐納美國務卿史汀生依期集議、此層或有遠大影響、因英美兩總揆在泰狄歐與德總理白魯寗二人意見間之仲裁、至少已暫告擱置矣、史汀生不能在日內瓦久待、定星期五日取道立維拉返美、而麥唐納亦未能久留於日內瓦、自德國國家社會黨領袖希特勒選舉獲勝後、法國決定不再對德讓步、故泰狄歐與白魯寗間、能否有眞正諒解、殊可疑也、</p>
<p>國民社二十八日柏林電　昨夜德政界聞原定明日在日內瓦舉行之五大國會議作罷消息後、深爲失望、今晨德報幾一致謂法總理之稱病不赴日內瓦、僅係託辭、社評論調咸詆法國仍師去年陰阻胡佛停付戰債計劃之故智、此次又暗中破壞企圖恢復國際均勢之希望、保守派報紙認法國此次未有以副美國務卿史汀生之努力、足見法國態度之頑強、當可使其他各邦尤其德國深信與法國力求諒解之徒勞無益、謂法國決意鞭笞歐洲、剜得一鎊心頭肉而後已、無有可以轉換其決心者、即較溫和之報紙、亦認此次五大國會議爲可望商得重要決議之良好機會、乃法人暗中阻撓、實可失望、如柏林日報則懷疑最近之將來、能否再過此種良機深以失之交臂爲憾、並謂法國此種手段、不得不使德國民衆益堅抗法之心、柏林午報謂今晨法報未著一字、表示五大國會議作罷後之遺憾、愈足見泰狄歐不願赴日內瓦、其稱病不過推託而已、又謂倫敦政界對此次各國當局談話之中輟、表示最深切之遺憾、以爲其原因實以法國國內狀況及總選舉爲主、惟其中輟之方法、可稱不幸、希望法國選舉完畢後、仍可陸續談判、惜屆時史汀生不克再親自參加耳、外間謠傳法國力主展緩洛桑會議、今日已由官廳證明不確、謂英國深知賠欵問題有解決之必要、決不允其展期云、</p>

<p>自淞滬間中日戰事發生。十九軍之威名。幾於舉世皆知。前者於役南翔。該地即爲十九軍七十八師之駐防地。師部在焉。是時。南翔車站。冠蓋如雲。該師師長區壽年。副師長譚啟秀。參謀長李擴。及其他軍官等。往來必至站長室小坐。偶與若輩譚國事。輒以東北淪陷。爲整個民族之恥。尤以不能收復失地。引爲大恨。洎自淞滬形勢緊張。或詢以戰否。則曰倘政府不欲本軍隊抵抗外侮。吾輩惟有自投義勇軍耳。言下憤然。可見該軍禦侮決心。由來已久。鐵血灑淞滬。想十九軍將士。如願以償。必引爲男兒第一快事也。</p>

<p>幸免沙蟲。惟間接所受之影響。則以金融停滯。百業凋殘。民食問題。遂陷絕境。於是此破天荒之麻雀會以起。先是鄕民有靑面虎者。家小康。而慷慨有任俠風。號雖云云。固非白水灘中人物也。憫貧戶之無食者多。挺身向地方當局宣言。倘不謀救濟辦法。多穀之家。人將就食。民其雀矣。請自隗始。貧戶聞風響應。富者咸起恐慌。願出粟貸人。間有鄙夫。杜門自守。羣雀民乃嘯聚而至。傾其所有。或升或斗。或肩負。或衣囊。相望於道。皆雀躍以去。守財虜則痛極而泣。以所失之白米。乃平日忍飢不食之餘糧。不謂反以誨盜也。然起視市上。則酒徒賭徒與夫紅丸黨。益欣然徵逐矣。可嘅也。</p>

<p>安玉田點了點頭。就一直跟了梁笑雲到了伊臥室裏面。似這樣一處淸秘華美仙宮般的好所在。旁的傖夫谷子。雖輕易不能踏得進。安玉田在從前却也曾進來瞻仰過的。一座西式最精巧的銅床。鋪疊起香衾錦被。繡枕絨氈。依然是那般絢麗。一屋子錦繡裝成奶油色的西洋木器。不拘是妝台鏡櫃。玉案銀屏。全具有藝術的圖案。與很和諧的色澤。再襯上滿牆壁是粉紅色印度花緞裱而成。這時候屋內光綫不足。早開上幾盞北京絹面宮燈式的電燈。照耀得金碧輝煌。更顯出是一種柔和燦爛的光彩。種種融合起來。便是些眩人的光。迷人的色。醉人的香氣。薈萃成另一種不可思議和美妙難言的魔力。能使踏進來的任何男性人等。都會有身入迷宮的異樣的感覺。直須魂消骨化。死也想賴在這裏。安玉田今天多承優渥。勝地重臨。一到了門邊。他那些憂愁煩苦。便早被這裏的門神阻擋在門外。不許跟同進去打攪。并另有個司歡樂的神祇。接引著他。如同到了另一個極樂的世界。本就有些飄飄若仙。不復知有人間世一切的苦惱了。梁笑雲迷迷軟樂餳的向銅床上一躺。手指着床當中一副光亮奪目的燈盤子。向安玉田說道我雖不願意把這個弄上了癮。日久受它的挾制。但也很歡喜點著這盞燈。偶而燒兩口解悶兒。尤其是有好朋友到來。彼此一燈相對。促膝談心。可以添助不少的興味。你這兩天精神不大好。不如也躺了下來。玩上一口罷。安玉田身不自主。情不可却。雖也很迅捷的遵命躺下。但仍搖搖手說道。對不起。我這個窮苦學生。從今是不配這樣的享樂了。就是你這裏。也似不配由我再來插足。今天我是特來與你話別的。往後你我不特在形迹上應該疏遠。便是那一點子友誼。也當從此中斷。這是各人爲天定的境遇所限。沒法子的事呀。言下不禁黯然。眼眶邊漸漸有些潮潤。梁笑雲却仍是若無其事般笑說道。哎呀呀。你連我這個朋友都不想要啦·不過我要問你。你一個人究打算怎樣辦呢。說時。恰裝好了一口烟。遞與安玉田呼呼的一氣吸完。</p>

<h3 id="c144">鄭孝胥的政見 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 垢·</p>
<p>昨天有個朋友，從北平回來，聽見鄭孝胥最近對於一　般狐羣狗黨，發表政見，因爲該黨徒中，還有幾個天良尚未喪盡的，對於傀儡政府的措施全失自由，表示不滿，鄭氏因而發表此政見，聞其中最重要的精理名言，就是如下的數語，</p>
<p>「從前張勳復辟不成，原是權利思想太發達的緣故，我現在絕對不主張權利云云」，</p>
<p>這句話我認爲奇妙而達觀得很，我到要把他的政見，略略討論一番，國家成立的要素，原以權利爲主體，所以成立國家，必以土地，人民，主權，三者爲主要條件，這就未曾研究過政學的人，也多曉得，現在鄭孝胥旣「不主張權利，」則所謂「僞滿洲國」還剩些什麼呢？</p>
<p>我也的確可以原諒鄭孝胥的苦衷，並且可以闡發他的「不主張權利」的意思，</p>
<p>在鄭孝胥之意，以爲我祇要復辟，祇要有磕頭之所，就名義也可，傀儡也可，不必定要居其實利，這種意思，在表面上看來，似甚達觀，但是他的意思，完全差誤，完全荒謬，</p>
<p>假定而果達觀的話，原不必定要復辟，只要政權在手，開明專制也可，共和政體也可，何必定要復辟，假定復辟而復「不主張權利」的辟，更易商量，即如宣老統在天津的時候，他人不認宣統，你儘管認爲宣統，他人不認爲皇帝，你儘管認爲皇帝，天天去朝見，天天去三跪九叩首，所謂「關門改年號」儘管復你個人的辟，亦是一種辦法，或說這種把戲，老奴已經幹慣，還不痛快，</p>
<p>我再替他把個達觀的法子，宣老統已是亡國之主，譬如敗軍之將，不足以立威，還是請滿淸的幾位老祖宗出來，如天聰，天明，順治，康熙，雍正，乾隆，道光，嘉慶，等等幾位老牌皇帝的牌位，天天去朝見，到還比較去朝見宣統有些體面，有些意義，若說還不爽快，還示達觀的話，</p>
<p>我再替他想個比較更達觀的方法，鄭孝胥雖是全無心肝，但到底是一個黃帝不肖的子孫，不如索性去請歷代帝王的神像出來，如黃帝，堯，舜，禹，湯，文，武，成，康，以及秦，漢，晋，唐，宋，明，等等這幾位是貨眞價實，眞眞老牌皇帝，天天去三跪九叩首去朝見，到也未始不可，何必定要暫時在日人手裏的東北，去演復辟的夢呢，</p>
<p>如謂歷祖歷宗是死的，但是宣統行屍走肉，怎樣可以算生，如謂歷祖歷宗是空的，則你「不主張權利的復辟」何嘗非空，試問同是空虛，同是傀儡，爲什麼這種臺定要坍在日人手裏呢？</p>
<p>所以我認定鄭孝胥「不主張權利」的復辟，眞是醉生夢死，</p>

<h3 id="c146">不用汽鍋的引擎 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 左企譯·</p>
<p>足以打破三百年來因襲的發力方法的一種新式引擎，不久將貢獻於英國實業界，以待試用，而觀成效。此項新式引擎不用汽鍋與凝汽器，以水代替蒸氣，</p>
<p>體積較尋常的汽機爲小，而發力之大則過之，且無爆裂的危險。發明者是英國工程歸馬龍氏（Ｊ·Ｆ·Ｊ·Ｍａｌｏｎｅ），馬氏研究此項水引擎（亦稱水機）已有多年，至最近始告成功。</p>
<p>此項水引擎與向來沿用的蒸氣引擎雖然都是用水作力源，但蒸氣引擎在能實施任何動作以前，必須先把水變成蒸氣，而馬龍氏底引擎所用之水，雖在每方吋數噸的壓力之下，仍然保持液體的狀態。</p>
<p>馬龍氏發明了一種新奇的變熱器，此外尚有其他優點如下，（一）祇需小量的水已足敷用，因此引擎底體積可以縮小，不佔地位，缺水的地方裝置此機尤稱便利；（二）消耗熱量較他種引擎爲少，其外殼常冷；（三）運轉及改變速度時發聲較向來的引擎爲微細；（四）機件較爲簡單，不易損壞，祇須每隔四年察騐一次；（五）無需時時洗滌汽鍋，不用騐水器，無短水或汗水之虞；（六）管理系統較汽機爲簡單；（七）無需放汽裝置，因機內之水可以久用不換；（八）所有軸承常保持冷態，由機內之水自行潤滑。</p>
<p>在電動機通行以前，科學實騐室中所用的熱氣引擎，其運轉方法，最與此種水機相近似。此水機應用水筒二，各有活塞連於同一軸上，水在二筒之間交互往復推動。其中一筒，發明者稱之曰「熱力堆」（Ｔｈｅｒｍｏｄｙｎａｍｉｃ　Ｐｉｌｅ），其一端由爐火之熱氣加熱至華氏九百度，另一端續由冷水或冷空氣冷却至華氏七十度左右。筒中的水，不息地流行於一組同心的管內，交互地變熱與冷却。這冷熱水層反向的通過熱力堆底鄰層，其厚不過百分之一吋。用此法可使爐火熱氣底熱度極快的傳送於水，因此不難使引擎每分鐘運轉二百五十次。</p>
<p>當熱堆裏的水受熱時，壓力高增而將一部分水推進至第二水筒，復將活塞推出，而傳動於機件。其後熱堆裏的流水全部冷却，於是第二水筒裏的活塞隨壓力低減而縮進。這樣，用液體代替蒸氣，可以較小的溫度變化得到巨大的壓力變化。</p>
<p>發明者馬龍氏稱：『一架水引擎機車能以半數的耗煤量，發生與優等蒸氣機車同樣的工率。』</p>
<p>馬龍氏預計他的新式引擎將應用於船舶，火車·發力所及其他沿用汽機的裝置。而此項引擎尤適宜於短水短煤的偏僻地方云。</p>

<p>— 際雲·</p>
<p>客有熟悉日本情形的，</p>
<p>一昨晤於旅邸，所談頗有記載的價值，在下便把牠述寫在左面；</p>
<p>此次戰事發生，日本市上，流行一種地圖麺包，法於軟潔的麺包上，烙印軍用地圖，一爲東三省的，一爲淞滬的，舉凡山脈河流，交通要道，都詳列清楚，一望而知，於此可見他們的侵占野心，無可遮諱的了，一般人士，紛紛購取這種麺包，用以犒勞前敵戰卒，虹口匯山碼頭，曾運到這種地圖麺包，計有數百篋之多，又他們黑夜行軍，常備有一種燐質地圖，性質和夜光錶一樣，黑黯中能發出微綠的光來，指示地勢，及一切要隘，凡屬上級軍官，都備携其一，據說這種軍用品，曩年歐戰中，爲德人所發明，倭人不過師承其故智罷了，</p>
<p>戰士之骸，大都裝着袋兒，運還日本，茲聞某軍官以尸骸太多，運還很覺累贅，獻議把尸骸煮熬成油，爲烟幕彈的原料，那是何等殘暴的一回事。不知道道要不要成爲事實呢，</p>
<p>唉！</p>
<h3 id="c148">明日 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 心秀</p>
<p>「明日復明日，明日何其多，吾生待明日，萬事成蹉跎，」這首明日歌，是和西諺「今日之事，須今日了之，勿待至明日，」的意義相同，都是諷勸人們，凡認爲該做的事，便該「當機立斷」的去做，切莫今日挨明日，</p>
<p>可是「明日」兩字，差不多已經成爲中國人的口頭禪，不但一般大人先生們做事，只顧隨意高興，不管什麼「今日」弄不好有「明日」明日弄不好還有「明日」便是正在求學「寸陰是競」的莘莘學子們，也是這樣，他們今日起身晏了，或是功課太不及別人了，老是拿「明日再早些起來，明日再努力用功」來自寬自解，他們忘記了「吾生有涯」的一句名言啊，　　唉，明日復明日，眞不知蹉跎了幾許寶貴的光陰，躭誤了幾多重大的事情，下面所寫的就是一個事實的證明，　　S君住在閘北××里，在滬變的第三天，他的同居搬向租界避難的時候，曾再三勸他及早遷移，他也自知處在危險區域，但他素來性情疏懶，遇事總是因循延遲的，雖然在那風聲鶴唳的當兒，他依舊是「今日挨明日」的不即實行，可是無情的砲火，却不容許他活到「明日」，轟的一聲但立刻請他到鬼門關去，而他就做了「明日」的犧牲品了，</p>

<p>當我走出校門，街頭巷口，總是充滿了垢頭汗面的孩子底噪聲，他們竄東竄西的奔跑，整天地無意義的幹着玩意兒，這原是他們的生活！沒人指導！也沒人管理，</p>
<p>可憐這般貧困的失學兒童，他們沒有錢讀書，高大的學校，他們祇有在牆外瞻仰的福分，學校原是貴族子弟的場所，知識本來是資產階級的專利品，唉！義務教育的普及，還能有實現的一天？這種高調，該少唱唱吧！</p>
<p>行政界上的先生！請低下頭，瞧瞧這千百萬的可憐蟲，他們的幸福，權利誰剝削了去？他們被視爲人間最卑賤的東西，在這熙熙攘攘的市場上，被踐踏得呻吟，哀求，死亡，</p>
<p>要是認爲教育還能救國的話，對於這些沒錢的失學兒童，該怎樣處置？他們是迫切地期望着你们能引進學校之門，</p>

<h3 id="e1">Further Discussion on Postal Rate Increases <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>The matter of postal rate increases has been briefly discussed before. Since the recovery of postal administration rights, the business has been experiencing daily losses. Commentators generally attribute this to improper measures taken by the authorities. However, to attempt to compensate for business losses by increasing rates is an even more inappropriate measure. According to their rate increase plan, all types of mail, except newspapers, will see significant price hikes, with books and printed materials being particularly affected. Disregarding the appeals of the people, and at the expense of hindering cultural progress, they have resolutely decided to implement it. Moreover, according to a Central News Agency dispatch on the 27th, "The General Post Office states that this case has been decided by the Executive Yuan and has now been notified to the Universal Postal Union by the post office, making it inconvenient to change the original plan." This shows the authorities' stubbornness. Even if the people's letters and telegrams of opposition are as numerous as snowflakes, they will be ignored.</p>
<p>The unreasonableness of the postal rate increase has already been detailed by commentators, so we need not elaborate further. However, the authorities claim that the rate increase was decided by the Executive Yuan and cannot be changed. This reasoning is incomprehensible. Postal rate increases have a significant impact on the burden on the people and the obstruction of culture. Can the proposals of a few people in the Ministry of Communications and a single order from the Executive Yuan be regarded as iron laws that cannot be changed? This is a major question worth studying. In modern countries, for administrative cases that increase the burden on the people, the administrative authorities can only prepare proposals and submit suggestions to the legislative authorities. Now, the transportation authorities are simply relying on a single order from the Executive Yuan as a talisman and directly increasing rates. The matter has not been approved by the Legislative Yuan beforehand, and our people have no way to exercise supervision afterward. What, then, is the purpose of establishing the National Legislative Yuan? The authorities must understand that canceling old orders with new orders, changing the original plan, and complying with public opinion involves no inconvenience in terms of legal principles and facts. Otherwise, once implemented, strong opposition from the people will lead to another dispute.</p>
<p>As for the so-called rate increase plan already being notified to the Universal Postal Union and being inconvenient to withdraw, this reasoning is even less adequate. Since the rate increase plan has not been approved by the Legislative Yuan beforehand, notifying the Universal Postal Union is clearly procedurally illegal. Remedying this situation rests with the authorities who initiated it. Even if the authorities have indeed notified the Universal Postal Union, it is not impossible to find a way to withdraw it. Moreover, there are international matters of far greater importance than this in terms of the nature of the facts. For example, international treaties are often signed by government representatives first and then approved by parliament. If parliament vetoes them, the signed treaties are as good as waste paper. Government representatives' external actions can still be withdrawn afterward. Is it really impossible to withdraw a simple notice about postal rate increases?</p>
<p>What the Central News Agency reported is difficult to discern the authorities' true intentions. If the authorities are indeed trying to use this "what's done is done" argument to appease the people, we cannot approve of it. Moreover, the people's opposition has deep and legitimate reasons. The book industry association's demands are entirely for the sake of cultural progress and not for purely selfish purposes. Otherwise, whether or not the postage for books is increased, the burden can be borne by the book buyers. Why would the book industry bother to repeatedly voice their concerns? We earnestly hope that the authorities will humbly adopt the opinions of all parties and consider the matter carefully.</p>
<h3 id="e2">League of Nations to Convene General Assembly Tomorrow <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Geneva Air Again Tense</p>
<p>Attitude of Small Countries' Representatives Agitated</p>
<p>Japanese Government Has Instructed to Abstain</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 28th - The League of Nations special assembly, originally scheduled to convene in early May, appears to have been changed to convene the day after tomorrow morning after meetings between the assembly chairman Hymans and Secretary-General Drummond. This is likely due to concerns that the Committee of Nineteen does not have sufficient authority regarding the decisions it is about to make.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 28th - The Committee of Nineteen will prepare a report to be submitted to the League of Nations special assembly. This report contains records of the Shanghai negotiations and the Manchurian Incident. The Committee of Nineteen plans to meet tomorrow morning to review it.</p>
<p>National Society, Geneva, 28th - This morning, the atmosphere in Geneva was tense again. Rumors circulated among representatives of small countries that Japan still could not accept the revised resolution of the Committee of Nineteen without reservations. Therefore, they immediately advocated reopening the League of Nations assembly on Saturday or next Monday. However, League of Nations insiders anticipate that at the secret meeting of the Committee of Nineteen at 5:00 PM today, the major powers will use their influence to try to change the situation. Supporters of the League of Nations claim that if the news that Japan cannot accept the resolution without reservations is indeed true, the situation will become the most serious since the League of Nations began to address the situation in the Far East. They added that on more than one occasion, compromise had been reached after numerous mediations, only to be overturned by last-minute reservations.</p>
<p>National Society, Geneva, 27th - Tonight, League of Nations insiders felt satisfied with Japan's acceptance of British Ambassador Lampson's compromise, but there was also a sense of resentment because Japan still refuses to cooperate with the Committee of Nineteen. Tonight, Japanese representative Nagaoka notified Secretary-General Drummond that Japan has accepted the new approach and must refuse to participate in any further discussions by the Committee of Nineteen.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 28th - The Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to hold a non-public meeting at 5:00 PM tonight, but it will not be secret. It will hear Chairman Hymans' report on the progress of the Shanghai ceasefire draft. The Japanese representative is no longer insisting on objections to the eighth and thirteenth items of the draft, so only the eleventh item is affected, and the content of the new Shanghai plan will be substituted. When the Committee of Nineteen convenes, it is said that maneuvering will still be needed to ensure smooth progress. Although Japan has expressed agreement with the new plan proposed by Ambassador Lampson, it still opposes including it in the League of Nations assembly resolution. The reason it gives is that matters concerning the ceasefire, which should be handled in Shanghai, are not relevant to Geneva. The Chinese government does not want to openly reopen ceasefire negotiations until the Committee of Nineteen's resolution has been accepted by Japan. The Japanese delegation has now requested instructions from Tokyo, but League of Nations insiders generally expect Japan not to change its attitude.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 28th - Today, according to a high-level source, the League of Nations' decision to convene an assembly to pass a resolution on the Shanghai ceasefire will put the government in a difficult position today. This is because there are several points in the resolution to which Japan objects. Therefore, the Japanese government is currently considering whether to instruct its representative not to vote at the time or to support it with reservations. However, the Japanese government does not want to obstruct the progress of the Shanghai negotiations.</p>
<p>Japan Alliance News, Tokyo, 28th - According to a telegram received today by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from Japanese representative Nagaoka, Committee of Nineteen Chairman Hymans and League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond discussed and decided to convene the League of Nations assembly on the 30th to review the draft resolution and make a formal decision because the decisions of the Committee of Nineteen cannot bind the member states of the League of Nations. The Japanese government originally insisted that the committee's resolutions could not bind Japan, so if the content of the League of Nations assembly's resolution is the same as the committee's resolution, Japan will never be able to support it. There are only three options: 1. Abstain; 2. Vote against; 3. Vote in favor with reservations. However, the result of Japan's abstention at the League of Nations assembly on March 11 caused problems, so this time, it seems that one of the second or third options will be chosen.</p>
<p>Electrical Communication News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - Committee of Nineteen Chairman Hymans, after consulting with Secretary-General Drummond yesterday, suddenly decided to convene the League of Nations General Assembly on the morning of the 30th and decided to adopt the draft resolution of the Committee of Nineteen as the resolution of the General Assembly. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the Japanese representative today stating the reasons for the decision: (1) The Committee of Nineteen does not have representatives from China and Japan, so the committee's decision cannot bind Japan; (2) Conversely, if it is a resolution of the General Assembly, Japan's abstention is legally valid, so it can bind Japan; (3) The General Assembly will give member states of the League of Nations other than the Committee of Nineteen the opportunity to express their opinions.</p>
<p>Electrical Communication News Agency, Tokyo, 28th - Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa convened a meeting of the heads of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon. As a result, the following fundamental policy was decided: (1) At the League of Nations General Assembly, the Japanese representative will attend to explain the progress of the ceasefire negotiations and Japan's attitude towards the Committee of Nineteen's plan; (2) It was decided to abstain from adopting the resolution because the League of Nations Secretariat officially notified the resumption of affairs. Therefore, a telegram has been sent to the Japanese representative with instructions.</p>
<p>League of Nations</p>
<p>Draft Resolution of Special Assembly</p>
<p>Unofficially Released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Yesterday</p>
<p>The Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the fact that the Japanese side has accepted the British ambassador's compromise, specially instructed the Information Department to unofficially release the draft resolution of this League of Nations. The following is a transcript:</p>
<p>Content of the Draft Resolution The draft resolution of the League of Nations Special Committee was unofficially released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. (1) Having examined the resolutions of the League of Nations Council of March 4 and 11, recommending that the representatives of China and Japan engage in negotiations, assisted by the civil, military, naval, and land authorities of the countries enjoying interests in the Shanghai International Settlement, with a view to agreeing on a solid ceasefire and determining the methods for the withdrawal of Japanese troops; (2) Having examined that the ceasefire and troop withdrawal methods involved in the Council resolutions of March 4 and 11 can only be agreed upon locally, and therefore the Special Committee cannot take the place of the negotiators, but each participating country attending the ceasefire negotiations has the right to notify the Special Committee if it encounters major difficulties during the negotiations or implementation of the aforementioned ceasefire and troop withdrawal methods, to be resolved by the Special Committee Council and under the supervision of the Council; (3) Having examined that the ceasefire and troop withdrawal negotiations should be conducted in accordance with the aforementioned Council resolutions, and neither party shall insist on conditions that contradict the aforementioned resolutions; (4) Having also learned that the clauses of the ceasefire agreement draft submitted to this committee have been accepted by both parties; (5) Believing that these clauses are all in line with the spirit of the aforementioned resolutions; (6) Specifically noting that, in accordance with Article 3, the Japanese government is committed to fulfilling the withdrawal of its troops to the Public Concession and the road expansion zone beyond Hongkou, as it was before the January 28 Incident in 1932; (7) Declaring that the spirit of the League of Nations Council resolutions of March 4 and 11 is that the withdrawal of Japanese troops should be fulfilled in the near future; (8) Declaring that the resolution of March 4 will only be fully complied with after the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops; (9) Having examined that the draft agreement stipulates the establishment of a joint committee, with the participation of members of neutral countries, to verify the withdrawal of troops by both sides and assist in the organization and handover of Chinese police in the areas where Japanese troops withdraw, so that Chinese police will take over their duties immediately after the withdrawal of Japanese troops; (10) Having examined that the committee, in accordance with its decision, monitors the implementation of Articles 1, 2, and 3 in the way it deems best, and is very satisfied with Article 3, which stipulates the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops to the state before the January 28 Incident; (11) Believing that the authority of the committee stipulated in Annex 4 of the draft agreement to monitor the implementation of Articles 1, 2, and 3 of the agreement includes the right to declare, at the request of one of the parties, that the time has come for the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, and hoping that the decisions of the committee can be unanimous, but declaring that if unanimity cannot be achieved, then in accordance with the provisions of Annex 4 above, any decision with a majority vote is legal, and the chairman has the right to decide (British Ambassador's proposed amendment is to add the draft ceasefire agreement No. 4, as the basis for the amendment of item 11 of the Special Committee's draft resolution); (12) Sincerely suggesting to the parties that they resume the existing stalled negotiations as soon as possible, and requesting the governments of the countries with special interests in the Shanghai International Settlement to continue to mediate for the purpose of achieving this goal; (13) Clearly indicating that if the conclusion is not obtained in accordance with the resolutions of March 4 and 11, this issue must be raised again in the Council; (14) Requesting the governments of the countries with special interests in the Shanghai International Settlement to forward to the League of Nations the reports obtained by their representatives participating in the Mixed Committee.</p>
<p>Ceasefire Conference</p>
<p>Held an Informal Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Will Add the Compromise Proposed by the British Ambassador</p>
<p>to Annex 4 of the Agreement</p>
<p>The ceasefire conference held an informal meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the British Consulate General and passed the compromise proposed by British Ambassador Lampson. Our side had already decided that the date for the resumption of the ceasefire conference here would only be determined after the Special Committee of the League of Nations Council passed a resolution. The sudden convening of the meeting yesterday afternoon was a temporary decision. The process was as follows: After British Ambassador Lampson proposed a compromise, the Chinese and Japanese governments expressed their acceptance successively and notified the League of Nations through their representatives. The League of Nations considered this sufficient to break the deadlock in the Shanghai ceasefire conference and also expressed its satisfaction. However, the draft resolution formulated by the Special Committee of the League of Nations Council this time is based on the draft ceasefire agreement, so procedurally, the British Ambassador's compromise must be added to the draft agreement before the Special Committee of the League of Nations can cite it as a basis to amend Article 11 of the committee's draft resolution. Otherwise, the Shanghai ceasefire conference will have to wait for the Special Committee of the League of Nations to pass a resolution before it can continue to meet, and the committee will have to wait for the draft agreement to add the British Ambassador's compromise before it can meet to amend its resolution, which would again become a stalemate. Due to this problem, British Foreign Secretary Simon sent a telegram to Ambassador Lampson in Geneva. After receiving the telegram yesterday afternoon, the British Ambassador specially went to Lowry Road with American Minister Johnson to visit our chief representative, Guo Taiqi, to discuss resolving this procedural difficulty. They then decided to hold an informal meeting at the British Consulate General at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The representatives present were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi, Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Aoi, British Ambassador Lampson, American Minister Johnson, Italian Chargé d'Affaires Ciano, French Minister's representative Legrand, and Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhang Sixu, and Japanese Embassy Secretary Okazaki. Neither military representatives from both sides attended. The meeting lasted two hours. The British Ambassador's compromise, which had already been accepted by the Chinese and Japanese governments, was formally passed and immediately added to Annex 4 of the ceasefire agreement.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Residents' Ambition Exposed <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Want to Develop a Japanese Concession in Shanghai</p>
<p>Dalu Bao reports that, according to well-informed sources from all walks of life in the Chinese community, the Japanese Residents Association in Shanghai has drafted a grand plan to develop a so-called "Greater Japanese Concession" in Shanghai. Zhabei, Jiangwan, Zhanghuabang, and Baoshan districts are all included. It is said that Shanghai's Japanese business leaders and influential Japanese residents are secretly discussing a plan to establish a Japanese concession around Shanghai, intending to demarcate more than ten miles along the Huangpu River as the concession, with Zhabei as the commercial center, Jiangwan as the residential area, Zhangjiabang as the military area, and Baoshan as the industrial development area. Once the Japanese authorities approve this plan, they will engage in construction work in the areas recently affected by the war.</p>
<h3 id="e7">After the Shanghai Municipal Council Issued a Statement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Taxpayers Association Protested</p>
<p>Hoping to Remove Unstable Forces that Disrupt Normalcy</p>
<p>Compensation for Chinese Nationals who are Kidnapped, Killed, and Suffer Losses</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement has submitted a protest to the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding the Council's statement.</p>
<p>"To the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council,</p>
<p>Having read your Council's statement published in various newspapers on April 27, it states, 'Unfortunately, there are still some unstable forces within the Settlement'</p>
<p>present, and one of the results is that irresponsible Chinese people repeatedly assault Japanese civilians, which further delays the restoration of normalcy that everyone expects.' In the humble opinion of our association, this deviates greatly from the meaning of 'justice.' The words 'All men are brothers' are the traditional thoughts and behaviors of our people. If a so-called impartial administrative organ truly does not deviate from the meaning of impartiality and shows no favoritism between the strong and the weak, then complaints will naturally disappear. However, what is the reality? We trust that your Council cannot pretend to 'know not what you know' and claim that there is no such fact. Our association believes that the speedy restoration of normalcy is as easy as turning one's hand. It requires addressing the root cause; attempting to alleviate the symptoms is like adding fuel to the fire. If Chinese people assault Japanese civilians, and if their motives are not based on legitimate self-defense, our association not only shares your Council's views but also believes that they should be brought to justice. However, how is the life and property of Xiang Songmao, et al., protected? Can anyone tell us? In summary, the reason why the public concession has today's commerce and prosperity is very clear. Also, the reason why it has suffered such destruction today is also very clear: in fact, it is because certain unstable forces do not trust and extremely despise the so-called impartial administrative organ. If these unstable forces cannot be removed, not only will the markets in the Hongkou area not be restored, but the prosperity and commerce of the public concession will inevitably decline day by day. It is not just a matter of the slow restoration of normalcy. Suppose that, in addition to the Chinese press, your Council's advice could also persuade all its residents, with their collective strength, not only to maintain their own security but also to do their best to prevent others from causing destruction, and had done so before January 28 of this year, your Council's Hongkou police force would not have been unable to deal with a kind of unstable forces, allowing the lives and property of those who should be protected to be killed, injured, kidnapped, robbed, and destroyed. Our association sincerely hopes to implement the meaning of justice and deeply hopes that your Council will quickly remove these unstable forces that disrupt normalcy from continuing to exist within the public concession. Our association has an unshirkable responsibility for your Council's efforts and will do our best to support them. In particular, we hope that the Chinese people who have been kidnapped, killed, and whose property has been damaged will be able to obtain redress and compensation. This letter is sent accordingly, hoping that you will investigate and take action.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>To the Director-General of the Shanghai International Settlement Municipal Council."</p>

<p>General Assembly Declaration: The Rent Reduction Movement Committee Representative Assembly issues the following declaration: This city is a major commercial port, with a mix of Chinese and foreigners, flourishing commerce, and a dense population. The demand for housing exceeds the supply, leading to increasingly high rents. Furthermore, wealthy merchants and gentry, wielding the authority of their assets, engage in monopoly and speculation, further increasing land prices and rent. The cost of rent alone, for the basic necessities of ordinary citizens, accounts for nearly half of their total expenditures. Compared to the interior, this is an immeasurable difference. Most of our citizens are worried and anxious, lamenting the shackles on their livelihood and eagerly awaiting the realization of the Principle of People's Livelihood to alleviate their personal suffering. Since the Japanese invasion and the outbreak of war, residents in areas affected by the war, such as Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong, have suffered the destruction of their homes and the deaths of their families, with their flesh and blood scattered. The misery is beyond description. Southern Shanghai and Pudong are also in a state of anxiety, constantly fleeing in fear, as if a great disaster is about to befall them. The concessions adjacent to the war zone are filled with stray bullets, blocked traffic, and dangerous situations. While they have been fortunate enough to avoid being devastated by artillery fire, the prosperous commercial market has been completely destroyed. We feel the hardship of these difficult times, and our hearts are filled with pain. Now that peace negotiations have been initiated and the overall situation has stabilized, we are enduring the pain and reopening the market,勉維殘局, but our livelihoods are cut off at their source, and we still worry about interruptions to our food and clothing, yet rent remains as high as before. It has not been reduced in accordance with the decline in the social economy, nor has it been waived or reduced in consideration of the inability of citizens to live in peace. Is this fair in terms of law and reason? Moreover, we are not seeking a permanent assessment but a temporary reduction. How can it be said that we are making unreasonable or excessive demands on the part of the landlords? Furthermore, the social economy is currently exhausted. There is no way to harmonize without rent reduction, and there is no other way to hope for the restoration of a prosperous market. The general assembly upholds the spirit of sharing adversity and the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity. We are not afraid of hard work and resentment. We are leading the masses and formulating rent reduction methods based on the actual conditions of each district, making them public to society, and putting them into practice. We also declare to our landlords that they should understand the hardships of the people, act voluntarily, fulfill their responsibility of helping each other in times of difficulty, and seek an opportunity to restore the prosperity of the market. If they are not understood and are ignored, the road ahead will be full of thorns, and there will be no end in sight. The landlords should bear full responsibility for causing unnecessary disturbances. We speak sincerely and hope you will adopt our suggestions. This declaration is made with utmost sincerity.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Relief Association <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Declaration</p>
<p>Various circles in this city, for the sake of assisting the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, have specially organized the Northeastern Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Relief Association, which was formally established on the 18th and began operations on the 26th. Yesterday, the association issued a declaration, distributing it to private individuals and groups at home and abroad. The text is recorded as follows: The three provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang are, in terms of national law and politics, an integral part of our country's territory and should be governed by our central and local governments. In terms of society and economy, they are the tail end for the migration of the inland's surplus population, and the supply of resources for the inland people's lives. Its land is known as 373,700 square miles, which is about one-third of the total area of our inland eighteen provinces, with a population of over 30 million. Its wealth and the thickness of its land are unparalleled in the world. Its position is as important as the brain and spinal cord of our country and nation. Its survival, gains, and losses relate to the life and death of our entire country and entire nation, not just the victory or defeat of a part or the honor or disgrace of a moment. The Japanese militarists, harboring the ambition to conquer the world, want to annex the three northeastern provinces as a preliminary step in conquering China, and further conquer our country as a starting point for conquering the world. Starting on September 18 of last year, they began their preliminary invasion, successively occupying our three provinces, and successively destroying the governing bodies of the three provinces. The infinite resources of our three provinces were thus taken over by the Japanese slaves, and our inland's surplus population will no longer be able to take a step out of the Shanhai Pass from now on. The population that has already moved to the three provinces, in addition to being killed, insulted, and violated, will be forced to return to their hometowns, cutting off their livelihoods. This has already caused our entire country and nation to suffer a fatal injury. Our northeastern officials foolishly hoped to beg for mercy with the three words "non-resistance", but the enemy took an inch and advanced a foot. On January 28, they advanced on Shanghai with naval, land, and air forces, destroying our culture, destroying our commercial markets, and massacring our people. In the three northeastern provinces, they are actively building a puppet state. Our government and northeastern officials still do not hear of sending a single arrow. Alas, in times of peace, they are dressed in silk and eat delicacies, but in times of crisis, they are walking corpses. What can the country and the people entrust their lives to? Fortunately, generals such as Ding Chao and Li Du, as well as folk heroes such as Wang Delin, are guiding the volunteer army, fighting bravely and killing bandits. For half a year, with uncoordinated troops without reinforcements, they have fought independently, repeatedly defeating the strong enemy, preventing the enemy from sleeping peacefully, preserving justice for the universe, and fighting for the personality of the nation. Great and magnificent, it is weeping and singing. A line of life for our nation is tied to this. The members of this association are either natives of Shanghai, or migrant residents from other places, or from foreign countries, or from various provinces. Their feelings and environments are not entirely the same, but being in Shanghai, the center of transportation and culture, and having personally experienced the lessons of the 34 days of bloody battle, they firmly believe that fearing and avoiding the enemy will only lead to self-destruction. Only armed resistance can guarantee our own survival, and only armed resistance can win the sympathy of the world and the enemy's reflection. They also firmly believe that assisting the soldiers is assisting ourselves, and assisting the Northeast is assisting the whole country. At present, the Northeastern Volunteer Army is working to protect the country and preserve the nation under the pressure of a strong enemy, not hesitating to risk their lives to fight against steel and artillery fire. How can the people who live safely outside the line of fire, who are being protected and preserved, bear to stand by and do nothing to help? Therefore, we have gathered comrades and initiated this association, and have already elected directors and started work on the 26th. We hope that compatriots at home and abroad will remember the importance of those who are born into death,推已飢已溺之懷, and do what they can to contribute to the righteous cause, hoping that in terms of spirit, we can increase the momentum of the Northeastern Volunteer Army to kill the enemy, and in terms of material, we can increase the strength of the Northeastern Volunteer Army to kill the enemy. May the descendants of Yan and Huang continue their lineage forever, and may the beautiful rivers and mountains be preserved. This declaration is made with utmost sincerity, hoping for your consideration.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Social Bureau's Rent Reduction Method <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Reply to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau submitted a reply to the Municipal Government on the rent reduction method, stating that the high cost of rent in this city is the highest in the country. The biggest reason is the prosperity of the city. This kind of prosperity relies on the progress of the entire society, but only a few capitalists and landlords benefit from it, and the majority of the people suffer from the burden of high rent. According to the Principle of Equalization of Land Ownership of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, it is already inconsistent. The government has to proceed step by step during this reform period. The city's active expansion of affordable housing is also to solve the housing problem for the poor, but compared with the city's population, those who benefit are few and far between. This time, the Japanese invaders violated our territory. The houses in the war zone were destroyed, and the rear was indirectly harmed. The sharp decline in the economic ability of the citizens is an undeniable fact. Observing the situation in the past month, it seems that rent reduction cannot be delayed any longer in order to adapt to the citizens' environment and seek the city's recovery. The rent exemption in Germany after the Great War and the rent reduction in Japan after the earthquake have the same purpose. Furthermore, places such as Nanjing and Hangzhou have successively implemented rent reductions. This city is the first to bear the brunt, and it is feared that there is no possibility of avoiding this. However, this city is a mixed area, and it has a special zone relationship, so it is more difficult to handle. We must have detailed consideration beforehand. Checking the prevention of the continuous rise in rent, the fundamental solution is to follow Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's plan of equalizing land ownership, preventing the rise in land prices, or the government buying land in important areas to prevent landlords from speculating and monopolizing opportunities. But this long-term fundamental plan is not for today when the incident has occurred suddenly. There seem to be several ways to deal with the emergency, and I will explain them to you, (1) Rent reduction, according to the severity of the disaster, divide the area and determine the standard of rent reduction. In the war zone, such as Jiangwan, Wusong, and Zhabei, tenants are forced to move, and should be exempt from rent. In places such as Southern Shanghai, Pudong, Zhenru, and Songjiang, the situation of damage is different, and rent should be reduced separately. (2) Stop increasing rent. In relatively safe locations, there are cases of hoarding and increasing rent. This kind of speculative monopoly is really inappropriate. It seems that it should be strictly stipulated that rent should not be increased within a few months after the end of the war. (3) Organize a rent reduction committee. The planning of rent reduction is of great importance and cannot be left to the people's organizations to seek their own interests. This is to prevent abuses and to enable the people to receive the benefits of rent reduction. Therefore, the government should supervise the relevant bureaus, the Public Concession, the French Concession, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and other formal commercial organizations, and also hire municipal experts to organize a specialized committee to handle matters such as the division of disaster areas and the standard of rent reduction. (4) Restore the Rent Dispute Arbitration Committee. Rent disputes in this city have always been handled by the committee. In the future, rent disputes will become more frequent. It seems that the committee should handle rent disputes based on the decision of the rent reduction committee and the facts. The above is just a general outline. The detailed measures and the regulations of the committee can be formulated after the establishment of the committee, etc.</p>

<p>Representative Assembly: Only 69 companies including Fuyuan, Yongfeng, and Baofeng attended. 131 representatives including Qin Runqing and Lou Xunru attended.

<p>Notification to All Sectors: The Qianye (Money Exchange) Trade Association, in order to abolish the restriction on inter-bank remittances of Zhuangpiao (native bank notes) and stipulate the date of the final conclusion of this session, notified all sectors: Our industry has a history of more than 100 years in Shanghai, and has always been committed to regulating finance and assisting all industries. At the end of each year, it is the end of the year. In the following year, we will resume business based on the spirit of mutual assistance and seek the welfare of society. This habit has been passed down for a long time. At the end of January this year, we were engaged in the final conclusion. Unfortunately, the Shanghai war broke out and the city was shocked. We closed for six days to mourn. Then, on February 4, we resumed business and handled it as usual. On the one hand, to prevent the outflow of cash, we will temporarily limit the Zhuangpiao issued by various banks to inter-bank remittances, except for customers who purchase daily necessities. On the other hand, we will consolidate the internal structure and jointly establish a property custody committee to consolidate our strength. Fortunately, the local market in this port has gradually stabilized and finance has become active. Our association is to facilitate customers. For the current Zhuangpiao, we have used the words "inter-bank remittance". It is specifically decided that all remittances will be cancelled on May 1 and return to the normal state, and in accordance with the Social Bureau's announcement and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's notice, the deadline will be extended to the end of May for the final conclusion of this session. I hereby notify you for your information.</p>

<p>Supporting Sun Ke's National Salvation Program</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Federation of Trade Unions telegraphed, saying: "The Japanese invasion is becoming more and more rampant. The mediation of friendly countries is still as arrogant as before. The only way forward is to reorganize our forces and continue to resist. Recently, Mr. Sun Ke, the revolutionary leader of our party, keenly concerned about the country, specially issued a program for resisting Japan and saving the country, advocating the promotion of constitutional government and the completion of political tutelage in the shortest possible time. His fundamental principles for the future political, diplomatic, and party reforms are the guiding principles for the party and the country. If they can be implemented as soon as possible, the political situation will change, and the national situation will definitely be overtaken. In addition to requesting the central government to adopt the program as soon as possible, we hope that the people of the country will rise up to support it. Our association will lead the workers of our entire city to work together to achieve it. The Shanghai United Federation of Trade Unions bows respectfully."</p>

<p>(Harbin) News received here today states that the Japanese army occupied Hailin last night. Hailin is located on the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, about 200 miles from Harbin. Although the Japanese cavalry has entered the town, the main force of the Japanese army is still at Hengdaohezi, about 30 miles from Hailin, because the railway tracks have been destroyed and they are unable to advance. It is reported that the Japanese military authorities have occupied about fifty miles of the Chinese Eastern Railway from Shitouhezi to Hengdaohezi. Further news from the front line indicates that the anti-Manchukuo forces have an armored train manned by Russians who are firing artillery. However, it is not known whether these Russians are Bolsheviks or White Russians. Banditry in eastern Northern Manchuria remains intense. Recently, bandits demanded 20,000 yuan from the Railway Bureau but were unsuccessful. They then attacked the forestry area operated by the Chinese Eastern Railway near Shitouhezi.

<p>Clues in Bridge Bombing Case</p>
<p>Believe it's Connected to the Communist Party</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities Not Giving it Much Importance</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to the police of the "Manchukuo", the bombing of the Songhua River bridge was carried out by the Soviet Russian Communist Party. Important clues have now been found, so the perpetrators of the incident involving the Japanese troop train on April 12th will not be difficult to track down. Documents seized have revealed a plot to destroy the bridges over the Songhua River and Nen River, which was allegedly masterminded by the Soviet Russian authorities. Several well-known financiers, consular officials, and Soviet Russian merchants in northern Manchuria are involved in the case. The Communist Party has provided spiritual and financial support to this violent organization, which has 2,978 members. Its leader is Gaituk, the secretary of the General Affairs Department of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Most of the members have received training from military authorities in Khabarovsk. They came to Harbin between October and November of last year. Those who join the organization must swear an oath that they will not hesitate to kill even their parents if ordered to do so. Those who violate orders or leak secrets of the organization will be sentenced to death. The explosives needed were all transported from Blagoveshchensk. (28th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Commenting today on the Manchurian government's accusation of a Soviet Russian plot to disrupt Manchurian security, a Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that even if Japanese officials confirm that the bombing of the Japanese troop train was a Communist plot, relations between Russia and Japan will not necessarily become strained as a result. This is because it is believed that the case is only the action of individuals. The military also seems to hold the same opinion. According to the Jiji Shimpo, Army Minister Araki said that if it is determined that Chinese Eastern Railway officials are involved in the case, the Japanese government may lodge a protest with Soviet Russia, but he believes that there will be no serious consequences.

<p>Suspends Trip to Geneva</p>
<p>Evades Joint Pressure from Britain and America</p>
<p>Conference of Five Major Powers Fails</p>
<p>Franco-German Compromise Dissolves</p>
<p>Stimson Deeply Disappointed</p>
<p>Will Return to America Via Italy</p>
<p>A Certain British Official Issues a Warning</p>
<p>Stating that Ship-Building Plans Will Be Resumed</p>
<p>Special Telegram from the National News Agency in Geneva on the 27th: Today, French representative, Peng Gu, informed U.S. Secretary of State Stimson and British Prime Minister MacDonald that French Premier Tardieu would be unable to come to Geneva on Friday due to illness. Consequently, the highly anticipated conference of the five major powers will be canceled, and all hopes for a Franco-German compromise will be dashed. Stimson and MacDonald have repeatedly stated that European countries can contribute more during this period than any other nation. British and American navies are already limited, and their armies can be considered practically at a minimum. Therefore, the adherence of Italy and France to the London Naval Treaty and a Franco-German compromise are considered the most urgent matters.</p>
<p>Special Telegram from the National News Agency in Geneva on the 27th: It is believed here that French Premier Tardieu's excuse of illness to suspend his trip to Geneva indicates his unwillingness to change his attitude towards disarmament, reparations, and Germany. He seeks to evade discussions in Geneva to avoid pressure from Britain and America. It is said that Stimson and MacDonald planned to exert some pressure on Tardieu to ensure French support for the Anglo-American theory of qualitative disarmament. If France supports this, the disarmament conference is expected to achieve some success. This would raise hopes for the United States to make some concessions on the war debt issue. Now, with the French Premier's suspension of his trip to Geneva, talks between leaders of major powers have also been suspended, and all hopes have vanished. Unexpectedly, Segrant also informed this place that he would remain in Rome and suspend his trip to Geneva. The U.S. Secretary of State will depart for Italy tomorrow and take the Italian liner "Roma" from Genoa to New York on Friday. The fact that Stimson is returning home via Italy instead of France is considered highly significant. According to reliable sources, Stimson is deeply disappointed with the course of events. This situation is sufficient to negate all hopes of American concessions on war debts. British Prime Minister MacDonald and German Chancellor Brüning will also depart for home tomorrow. After returning home, the German Chancellor will face a critical situation, as France's attitude will further increase the power of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>Special Telegram from the National News Agency in Geneva on the 28th: U.S. Secretary of State Stimson has firmly decided to travel by car to Cannes after lunch on Saturday and return home in a few days.</p>
<p>Special Telegram from the National News Agency in Berlin on the 28th: German Chancellor Brüning will return to Berlin tonight. Tomorrow morning, he will visit the President to report on the Geneva consultations. Immediately afterwards, a special cabinet meeting will be held to discuss the situation after the failure of the five-power conference.</p>
<p>Special Telegram from the National News Agency in Paris on the 27th: The political circles were shocked tonight after the announcement that French Premier Tardieu had canceled his trip to Geneva and suspended his election speech in Belfort. According to official announcements, Tardieu is suffering from laryngitis due to overwork, and doctors strongly advise rest. Even if he went to Geneva, he would not be able to participate in the meetings of British, American, Italian, and German officials. Therefore, it had to be temporarily canceled. It was strongly denied that Tardieu's illness had diplomatic implications, and it was stated that it was due to overwork from simultaneously handling national affairs, directing the election campaign, and attending the Geneva conference.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram from Paris on the 27th: French Premier Tardieu is unable to go out due to laryngitis. He has now received a telegram from U.S. Secretary of State Stimson stating that he is saddened that the important matters recently considered in Geneva cannot be reconvened. He cannot stay in Geneva for long due to health reasons, but the U.S. delegation in Geneva will do its utmost to promote the spirit of this discussion to the extent of its power. British Prime Minister MacDonald also telegraphed Tardieu, hoping for his speedy recovery.</p>
<p>Special Telegram from the National News Agency in Geneva on the 27th: Today, a certain British official issued a warning that if France and Italy fail to join in completing the London Naval Limitation Treaty, Britain will be forced to notify the United States and Japan of the possibility of proposing the "special provisions" of the treaty. Negotiations between France and Italy on naval issues have been delayed for months without resolution. There are fears that if the opinions of both sides cannot be compromised, Britain may resume its shipbuilding plans to maintain the balance of national defense.</p>
<p>Reuters Telegram from London on the 27th: A Geneva telegram states that a certain important British politician stated to journalists there that Britain believes that the progress of disarmament discussions is too slow and disappointing. He also stated that Britain may have to consider using the articles of the London Naval Treaty that allow the building of warships within specified limits. French Premier Tardieu is not currently in Geneva, as he is suffering from laryngitis and must rest. It is generally believed that this forced rest is not necessarily a bad thing, as it can avoid open frustration in Geneva. Tardieu is currently living an extremely busy life, not only having to conduct extremely important diplomatic negotiations in Paris and Geneva, but also having to conduct an election campaign in his electoral district of Belfort. Tardieu recently stayed in his electoral district for sixty hours, spending forty-five hours speaking at open-air rallies. Tardieu now has a good chance of being re-elected, and although he is temporarily ill, he can still direct the campaign from his Paris residence. However, the fact that Tardieu was unable to meet as scheduled with British Prime Minister MacDonald and U.S. Secretary of State Stimson in Geneva on Friday may have far-reaching consequences, as the mediation of the British and American prime ministers between the opinions of Tardieu and German Chancellor Brüning has been at least temporarily shelved. Stimson cannot wait long in Geneva and is scheduled to return to the United States via the Riviera on Friday, while MacDonald cannot stay long in Geneva either. Since the election victory of Nazi leader Hitler in Germany, France has decided not to make any further concessions to Germany. Therefore, it is doubtful whether there can be any genuine understanding between Tardieu and Brüning.</p>
<p>Special Telegram from the National News Agency in Berlin on the 28th: Yesterday evening, German political circles were deeply disappointed upon hearing the news that the five-power conference scheduled to be held in Geneva tomorrow had been canceled. This morning, almost all German newspapers stated that the French Premier's claim of illness was merely an excuse. Editorial comments criticized France for resorting to the same old trick of obstructing the Hoover moratorium on war debt payments last year, and this time secretly undermining hopes of restoring international equilibrium. Conservative newspapers believe that France's failure to support U.S. Secretary of State Stimson's efforts shows the stubbornness of France's attitude, which should make other states, especially Germany, deeply convinced that it is futile to seek understanding with France. It is said that France is determined to scourge Europe and gouge out a pound of flesh from the heart, and nothing can change its determination. Even the more moderate newspapers believe that this five-power conference was a good opportunity to negotiate important resolutions, but France's secret obstruction is truly disappointing. For example, the "Berliner Tageblatt" doubts whether there will be such a good opportunity again in the near future and deeply regrets missing it. It also stated that France's actions will inevitably make the German people more determined to resist France. The "Berliner Mittagspost" stated that this morning's French newspapers did not write a word expressing regret over the cancellation of the five-power conference, which further shows that Tardieu was unwilling to go to Geneva, and his claim of illness was just an excuse. It also stated that political circles in London expressed the deepest regret over the interruption of the talks between the authorities of various countries, believing that the reason was mainly due to the domestic situation and general elections in France. However, the method of interruption was unfortunate, and it is hoped that negotiations can continue after the French elections are completed, but Stimson will not be able to participate in person at that time. Rumors that France is strongly advocating postponing the Lausanne Conference have been proven inaccurate by officials today, stating that Britain knows that the reparations issue needs to be resolved and will never allow it to be postponed.</p>
<h3 id="e80">French General Election Approaching <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Serious Alert in the Suburbs of Paris</p>
<p>Special Telegram from the National News Agency in Paris on the 27th: The dates for the first and second rounds of the French general election are May 1st and May 8th. These two days happen to be Labor Day and the anniversary of Joan of Arc's victory, respectively, and both are Sundays. Therefore, the authorities expect that the election will inevitably be disrupted. As a precaution, mounted and foot police within 100 miles of the suburbs of Paris have been transferred to the capital to provide special protection for the 1st and 8th. Furthermore, French Premier Tardieu had intended to prohibit all parades and speeches for the sake of caution. According to reliable information, May 8th is the anniversary of Joan of Arc, and France has grand celebrations, which are difficult to prohibit. Therefore, the parades of Catholics, veterans, and students will still be held under the Joan of Arc monuments at Saint Augustine and Triangle Tower. However, May 1st is not a national holiday, so parades and speeches are still prohibited.</p>

The Turkish Prime Minister and his entourage then traveled by car, escorted by Russian infantry and cavalry, to the former Russian Palace, where they will stay. Soldiers and guards were stationed every two miles along the way. All newspapers gave extensive and exaggerated coverage, expressing warm welcomes. According to informed sources, the Turkish leader's visit at this time of tense situation in the Far East is sufficient to indicate the political power of Soviet Russia, and the Russians attach great importance to it.</p>

<p>Special Telegram from the National News Agency in Rome on the 28th: The Italian Parliament unanimously passed the aviation budget late last night. Aviation Minister Balbo delivered a speech, announcing that a great aviation station is being built fifteen miles east of Rome and will be completed this year. Large barracks are being built next to the airfield, where most of the Italian Air Force personnel will be stationed. There will be a training school and an aviation university. The Ministry of Aviation will also be moved here, and its name will likely be named after Mussolini. He also detailed Italy's new pursuit aircraft, which can reach speeds of 250 miles per hour and quickly ascend to a height of 15,000 feet. Finally, he strongly stated that the Italian Army Air Force's budget is only 75 million [currency unit obliterated], only one-third of the French aviation budget, and cannot be reduced.</p>

<p>Reuters Telegram from London on the 27th: Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Shi Zhaoji, has been residing in Spain for quite some time, taking the opportunity to rest. Mr. Shi returned to England today and is currently working on sorting out the unfinished business of the embassy in order to hand over the post. Mr. Shi told a Reuters reporter that he had resigned due to poor health and had been approved by the government, but on the condition that he should resume diplomatic duties as soon as his health recovered. Mr. Shi will go to Spain and Paris for medical treatment in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Hoover Urges Frugality in Government Spending <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Reuters Telegram from Ridge Manor on the 27th: President Hoover today addressed the Conference of Governors, urging state and local governments to be frugal in government spending. He stated that American expenditures were $2,900,000,000 in 1913 and increased to $13,200,000,000 in 1930. Of this, state and local government expenditures accounted for $9,800,000,000. During this decade and more, government spending as a percentage of national income rose from 8% to 20%, and the amount of debt owed rose from $4,800,000,000 to $30,600,000,000. So much of the nation's private income is consumed by government spending. If this continues, economic soundness will not be restored, as weakening the wealth of the people will stagnate production and consumption, and unemployment will not be reduced.</p>

<p>Public Telegrams</p>
<p>Telegram from London: To all compatriots across the country: Any method that tacitly permits Japanese soldiers to occupy areas outside the concessions, regardless of the reason, violates the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly. It is tantamount to overturning the entire case in the League of Nations, inviting defeat, and creating a bad precedent that will be fatal, making Japan's occupation of Manchuria and other places a legal act. We offer this alarming warning and ask everyone to observe carefully. Sincerely, the Overseas Chinese Association in London.</p>
<p>Telegram from Jingjiang: The Shanghai Shenbao Newspaper Office forwards to the charitable organizations and to Zhu Ziqiao, Xu Jingren, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Wen Lantin, Zhang Qianmiao and other philanthropists. We are deeply aware that Jingjiang is a small county with a large population, poor land, and impoverished people. The hardships of life are rarely seen in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Moreover, military conflicts and banditry have caused years of famine. In addition, there was a flood last autumn. Because Jingjiang is located on the Yangtze River, many counties in the lower reaches of the river drained through this county, making it difficult for the water to flow away quickly, resulting in the entire area becoming a swamp. The Daoshiguan area of Gushan District was the lowest-lying area in the entire county, known as the "bottom of the pot." The suffering last autumn was the same as that in Xinghua, Yancheng, Gaoyou and Shaobo. Fortunately, the Jiangsu Relief Association distributed some winter relief, which was barely enough to survive the year. However, since the beginning of spring, everything has been eaten and used up. At this time of year when the old harvest is gone and the new harvest is not yet in, the whole county is selling everything, and pawnshops have already announced that they will no longer accept pledges. The disaster victims have no way to borrow, and they are about to become starving corpses. Hungry cries are everywhere, and they are waiting to be fed. Snails and wild vegetables have all been searched and eaten. They are emaciated and many are starving to death, even selling their children and pawning their wives, entrusting orphans and seeking death. Scenes of devastation are unbearable to witness. Furthermore, because the water in the disaster area receded slowly last autumn, wheat seeds could not be planted. In the blink of an eye, the rice planting season is approaching. If relief is not sought quickly, the autumn harvest will likely be disappointing, and the future will be even more unthinkable. Therefore, we dare to plead on behalf of all the disaster victims in the county, asking the great philanthropists to have compassion for the hungry and drowning, to embrace the sick and treat them, and to provide prompt relief to those in distress. Whether it is money or flour, the more the better. We urgently telegraph and hope for relief, and we are extremely eager and hopeful. Liu Zaiji, Chairman of the Jingjiang County Chamber of Commerce; Zhu Xianying, Huang Shaochang, Zheng Xiangzhi, Sun Jiayuan, Standing Committee Members; Zhu Xianying, Zhang Nianhe, Sheng Zhongyan, Guo Jinwen, Zheng Jinzhang, Wang Dayi, Sheng Zhuoqun, Principals of the Red Swastika Society.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3 id="e87">League of Nations <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Investigation Team Arrives in Shenyang</p>
<p>Investigation Procedures Also Finalized</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: The League of Nations Investigation Team arrived in Dalian on the 21st morning. At 12:50 PM that day, Sir Lytton, Representative Gu Weijun, and their party, along with General Claudel, Dr. Hines, and Liu Chongjie, gathered at the South Manchuria Railway Station. They then headed north to Shenyang. Along the way, many people held flags to welcome them. The special train then slowly departed.</p>
<p>The special train consisted of eleven cars, similar in structure to our country's Jinpu special train. The last car was an observation car. The three commissioners from England, France, and Germany, along with their attendants, occupied one car. Next, the Japanese delegation occupied two cars, followed by the Chinese delegation in one car. It was the seventh in the sequence. Because they were traveling during the day, the cars were not sleeping cars. Sir Lytton, General Claudel, Dr. Hines, Representative Gu Weijun, and Representative Yoshida each occupied two rooms. The rest occupied one room each. However, the personnel of the Chinese delegation had two people per room. When asked, the Japanese delegation said they heard that there were only nine people in the Chinese delegation, not the twenty-odd people reported. The fourth car was occupied by representatives of the Kwantung Government and Japanese reporters. The third car was occupied by personnel of the South Manchuria Railway Company. The remaining cars were dining cars and baggage cars. Along the way, soldiers and police were stationed, creating tight security.</p>
<p>Around 2 PM, the train passed Pulandian. Rumors spread that the puppet Manchukuo would arrest the representatives of the Gu delegation, but nothing happened. The stations of San Shili Pu, Wafangdian, Dashiqiao, Anshan, and Liaoyang were stopped at briefly, either to add coal and water or to give way to southbound trains. The roadside was adorned with English slogans from the puppet Manchukuo. One depicted a dove with the words "Welcome Peace Envoy," and another said, "Join hands to build Manchukuo, the Geneva of the East." At Liaoyang Station, a military band and people holding five-colored flags lined up to welcome the delegation. The members of the investigation team did not get off the train, as it was dinnertime.</p>
<p>At 8:30 PM, the train arrived in Shenyang, where many people still welcomed them. When exiting the station, reporters from the Japanese Shinpo newspaper took the opportunity to take photographs, with magnesium flashes booming like a string of firecrackers. After arriving at the Yamato Hotel, five young women presented flowers to the investigation team. However, Sir Lytton had not yet recovered his health and was represented by his personal secretary, Mr. Easton. Rooms 201 to 208 of the Yamato Hotel were reserved for the Chinese delegation, with Representative Gu residing in Room 201. The others were accommodated in the Far East Hotel.</p>
<p>The party of Earl Lytton's land-based group, Major General McCoy, and Dr. Haas, after arriving, said that after departing from Qinhuangdao, they arrived at Shanhaiguan at 11 AM on the 20th. They visited the pass. The special train prepared by the Japanese arrived at 7 PM. Because it was decided to travel during the day, they all stayed in the train. On the 21st at 5:50 PM, they arrived at Jinzhou and got off the train to inspect. On the 22nd, they stopped briefly at the Daling River, arriving in Shenyang half an hour before Sir Lytton and company. This was because Sir Lytton was slightly unwell, causing delays along the way.</p>
<p>The investigation schedule is as follows: four days in Shenyang, departing Shenyang on the 25th evening, passing through Changchun, arriving in Jilin on the 26th morning, returning to Changchun in the afternoon, staying for two days, departing at 10 PM on the 28th for Harbin, arriving on the 29th early morning, staying for five days, going to Qiqihar on May 4th, staying for two days, returning to Shenyang via Sipingjie on the 6th, staying for another six days, visiting the Fushun Coal Mine, visiting the Anshan Iron Mine on the 13th, and returning to Dalian, staying for five days, concluding on the 18th. It is currently unknown whether the Chinese representatives will accompany the mission north of Changchun. The personnel of this delegation were each given a metal badge by the South Manchuria Railway Company, with the words "League of Nations" and a miniature of the East Pagoda printed on it, and a train pass, valid from April 20th to May 19th.

<h3 id="e88">Japanese Army in East Manchuria <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Withdraws from the Eastern Front</p>
<p>Due to Spring Season Being Unfavorable for Japanese Military Operations</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army Enjoys Natural Advantages</p>
<p>The "China Press" of April 18th reports from Harbin that opinions in Harbin are divided regarding the reason for the Japanese army's withdrawal from the eastern front. Furthermore, there is a lack of understanding as to why the Japanese troops along that route are being dispatched to Changchun on a daily basis. Not long ago, the commanders of various brigades heading towards the northeast of Harbin informed reporters from Russian newspapers in Harbin that their work had been completely completed. All bandits and government forces had been driven outside the line extending from Fangzheng in the west to Wujimishi in the east. Therefore, there was no need for the Japanese army to pursue them further. However, since the Japanese army's withdrawal from the aforementioned line, the former Jilin troops have returned and occupied many of the outermost stations along the Chinese Eastern Railway outside the city. Now they have even reached the right bank of the Songhua River. In reality, the Japanese army's withdrawal is due to the fact that it is currently spring, and the roads are soft and slippery, making it inconvenient for automobiles to travel. Infantry and artillery units are also unable to pass, making it very difficult to deal with guerrilla warfare. Furthermore, in another week, the rivers of northern Manchuria will begin to thaw, and troops will no longer be able to cross the rivers as they did in winter. Therefore, the Chinese army will enjoy various natural advantages. If, during this period of dormancy, the Chinese army receives a supply of ammunition, it will be extremely difficult to drive them from their current positions. There are widespread rumors that the various towns have been greatly devastated since the withdrawal of the Japanese army from the eastern front. However, according to people who have arrived in Harbin from that area in recent days, this is not the case. Even if there is banditry, it is nothing more than what is commonly seen every spring. (Translator's note: Recent foreign dispatches frequently report various news about banditry on the Chinese Eastern Railway, indicating that it is all propaganda.) The easternmost section of the Chinese Eastern Railway still flies the old "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" flag, as the former Jilin troops do not allow the stationmasters to replace it with the new flag of the puppet state. At present, the matter of greatest attention is the upcoming arrival of the League of Nations Investigation Team. The Japanese will do their utmost to prove that they are working for the welfare of the people, rather than being hostile to them. However, the Chinese people of all of Manchuria are still strongly opposed to Japan's occupation of their land by force, and they have no trust in the government of Manchukuo, which is completely controlled by Japanese soldiers. Generally, observers of the current situation believe that it is inevitable that the Japanese army will declare war on Soviet Russia. However, although Soviet Russia has fully prepared for war, it seems to have no intention of engaging in combat.</p>

<p>Observation by the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reports that Lieutenant General Hashimoto Toranosuke, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, arrived in Shenyang the other day and immediately held talks with Commander Honjo. He said that the situation in northern Manchuria has recently become critical, and the problem with Russia is getting worse. At the beginning of the Manchurian Incident, Russia did not take any active action. Afterwards, Red Russia gradually exposed its anti-Manchukuo and anti-Japanese movements. Recently, a large Russian army has moved eastward again, making the problem quite serious. Therefore, one cannot be at ease regarding the situation in Manchuria. Hence (Hashimoto) feels that the situation is tense and the responsibility is great due to his rapid appointment.</p>

<p>Reported in Japanese Newspapers</p>
<p>The Nagasaki Nichinichi Shimbun reports that when the 27th Brigade of the Manchukuo Army was advancing towards Yimianpo, it was suddenly attacked by the anti-Jilin army and suffered complete annihilation. The anti-Jilin army, numbering approximately 15,000, is currently concentrated in the Yimianpo area, and the situation is expanding. In order to maintain public order, our (Japanese) Murai Division urgently dispatched a large army to provide support and is currently engaged in fierce fighting near Zhuhe, east of Yimianpo. The railway to the rear of our army has been destroyed, and the situation is extremely serious.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Situation After the Fall of Zhangzhou <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Factories and Shops Confiscated by Bandits</p>
<p>Zhang's Division and Yang's Brigade Completely Routed</p>
<p>Situation in Quanzhou and Xiamen Becomes Increasingly Critical</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Red bandits in western Fujian have captured Liancheng, Yanping, Nan'an, Longxi (i.e., Zhangzhou). It is reported that the force consists of four units under Luo Binghui, Peng Dehuai, Ji Zhendong, and Lin Biao, totaling over 40,000 men. They are currently stationed outside the city, with only a small number of political workers stationed inside the city. Because no fighting occurred in Zhangzhou City, Zhang's division retreated immediately, so there was no major loss. Inside and outside the city, there are Mao Zedong's public notices to reassure the people, urging businesses and industries to operate as usual. Personnel are sent to investigate the names of shop owners and factory owners of large shops and factories. Generally, bosses, fearing arrest, all pretend to be shop assistants and workers. The party believes that since the capitalists have fled, the factories and shops should be taken over by the public, and workers are allowed to continue working and given pay raises according to their ranks. Personnel dispatched by the puppet government keep accounts in the shops, and the revenue, after deducting expenses, is all turned over for military expenses. The people are strictly forbidden from leaving the country privately. The original military plan was to divide into two routes, one entering Haicheng to pursue Zhang Zhen's division, and the other going out to Tong'an to attack Quanzhou. Later, it was learned that the two divisions of the Guangdong army, Huang Renhuan and Huang Zhiwen, had advanced from Jiaoling and Dapu, respectively, to attack Shanghang and Yongding at the same time, fearing loss of the rear and attack from both sides. Therefore, most of the bandits were transferred to resist in the Nanjian and Longyan areas. Temporarily taking a defensive posture towards Haicheng and Tong'an, Haicheng was occupied by Wu Ci, a bandit from Zhangzhou, the day before yesterday. Zhang's division, Yang Fengnian's brigade, was completely routed, leaving only Wang Zuqing's brigade of about 2,000 men. Zhang himself is now in Yunxiao, arranging defenses. Personnel from various Tong'an agencies also fled. Currently, the provincial defense army Chen Guohui's brigade is strictly blocking the scattered bandits in the area bordering Tong'an and Quanzhou. Quanzhou City has been affected, and business has completely stopped. In Xiamen, there are too many refugees fleeing from Zhangzhou, and there is a shortage of space. Furthermore, it is an island, isolated in the sea. Rice, firewood, and water have always relied on supplies from Longxi, Haicheng, and Tong'an. Now that they are cut off, it is also deeply felt that the situation is difficult. (April 26th)</p>

<p>Cruel Abuse of a Female Servant Nantao Dispatch, Cai Xiang, the son of a wealthy man, Yu Yongjie, is a doctor with a lustful nature. He seduced the female servant Ni Yin Nan and got her pregnant. On March 19th, his wife, Zhu, and others held Yin Nan down and massaged her up and down, causing Yin Nan pain and fainting. Fortunately, she still knew to feel ashamed and endured it. On the 28th, a stillborn fetus was aborted, and Yin Nan was also bedridden. On the 30th, Zhu and others became even more ferocious, dragging Yin Nan from the upstairs to the downstairs wall, calling outsiders to watch. At that time, Yin Nan was about to cry out for justice when she was suddenly covered by Wu Caixiang's palm. In the commotion, a righteous person rescued Yin Nan and sent her to the hospital and reported to the district office and sub-public security bureau, which reported to the Nantao General Bureau. Now the matter has been resolved through mediation by Zhu and others. It costs six thousand gold dollars.</p>
<p>Rampant Local Bandits in the Northeast of the Township Wuxi Dispatch, The northeastern part of Wuxi Township has long been an area where communists gather. After military and police cooperation, the momentum has subsided slightly. However, the remnants are not cleared, and they often make trouble. Recently, they have revived. There are often cases of robbery and ransom. The following is a description: (1) The family of Hu Xiaogui, a resident of Gu Jia Ba in the 11th district, is not wealthy, but five bandits suddenly came to Hu's house the night before last, each holding a handgun and rattan cane, and ordered them to pay 300 yuan. As a result, they collected 60 yuan and agreed to send the rest to a certain family ancestral hall in Baitan Mountain. The bandits then left swaggeringly. (2) The families of Fang Gengbao and Fang Yonggen, villagers in Fangjiaxiang in the district, were invaded by more than 20 bandits the other night, who kidnapped Gengbao and Yonggen and forced their families to prepare 200 yuan in cash each to redeem them in Baitan Mountain. As a result, the two men each raised 100 yuan and sent them there before being released. There are still 200 yuan missing, and they agreed to send it within five days. If they break the agreement, they will burn the Fang family's house.</p>
<p>A Woman from Jiangbei Attempts to Murder Her Husband Wuxi Dispatch, Yang Liansheng, a Jiangbei resident living at No. 122 Dongxin Road, opposite the Yayan Elementary School outside Guangfu Gate in this county, is 31 years old and has been working in Wuxi with his wife, Zhou, for many years. He used to work as a waiter in Rixin Pool. Recently, the bathhouse suddenly closed, so Yang went to Lequan Bathhouse as a replacement. The night before last, after finishing his work and returning home, he asked his wife, Zhou, to buy a bowl of noodles to satisfy his hunger. Unexpectedly, when he ate half a bowl, he suddenly found a lot of mercury in the noodles. Liansheng was shocked and lost consciousness. When the neighbors learned about it, they immediately sent Yang to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Doctor Zhu made every effort to give him an enema, and he was saved. At the same time, he reported to the Second Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau of the town for investigation. After receiving the report, Sub-Bureau Chief Zhu immediately sent bureau member Liu Qingtai to investigate Yang's home. A small piece of newspaper was found on the ground next to the stove, with mercury residue on it. Zhou was taken to the bureau and transferred to the county court for interrogation. A Traitor Was Captured on Longfeng Mountain A traitor was captured by the garrison on Longfeng Mountain outside the east of Jiangyin the other day. He was from Sidunzi in Jingjiang. He was immediately taken to the regimental headquarters for questioning. He confessed that he had been used by the enemy and received 60 yuan. There were three people who came with him, and two of them had mixed into the city. He had three Japanese one-sen copper coins and one Japanese yen on him. The traitor is now detained in the regimental headquarters, waiting to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Reaction to the Market Strike in Xinfengzhen Zhou Zhipeng, the captain of the Second Patrol of Jiaxing Water Police, accompanied by Zhu Xincan and Xing Huaican, went to Wu Yanqing's house in Xinfengzhen at the beginning of the month to arrest smokers without orders. Because they were all wearing plain clothes and did not show official documents, the town mistakenly thought it was a robbery and spontaneously went on strike. The local security corps also lined up for defense. Various legal groups also telegraphed the provincial government, the county government, and the water police district department. The next day, the district department sent personnel to the town to mediate and persuade the merchants to open their businesses. The matter seemed to have come to an end. Unexpectedly, the county government suddenly received an order from the water police bureau the day before yesterday to send the case to the court for investigation and charged Wu Yanqing and Shen Peiying (head of the security corps) with crimes such as privately smoking opium and obstructing official duties. The court has now issued summonses for investigation on schedule.</p>
<p>The Qian Industry Postpones Opening Zhenjiang Dispatch, The local qian industry was originally scheduled to open on April 25th, but due to the hasty preparations and the incomplete procedures of several companies, it was temporarily announced that the opening would be postponed to May 1st. It is reported that the opening this time is entirely for the purpose of rectifying arrears. New lending operations will not begin until after May 15th. According to insiders, the debts owed by various firms to the qian industry are due to the sealing of Japanese goods and the stranding of capital. Unless there is a solution to the Japanese goods issue and the proceeds from the sale of goods are obtained, it will be impossible to repay them. Various merchants learned of the above news and decided to postpone the listing in order to further determine the method of debt collection during the postponement period. It is reported that only Jin Yuan, Jin Sheng, Yuan Kang, Chang Kang, Zhengtai, Tongyu, Hengxiang and other seven companies are confident of listing. The future of business cannot be reversed.</p>
<p>A Robbery Case in Qishuzhen is Cracked Yangzhou Dispatch, The case of the looting in Qishu Temple Town a few days ago, in which the firearms of the police team were confiscated, has been investigated by the county police team repeatedly. It has now been discovered that the bandits' nest is located in Yanghe, near Hantang Township in the Seventh District. Yesterday, the police team stationed in Yiling Town, together with the security corps of the district, went to encircle and suppress them. A bandit boat was immediately found, and seven rifles and one box cannon confiscated from the Qishu Town police team, as well as twelve box cannon pistols owned by the bandits and other stolen goods, were seized.</p>

<p>Opposes the Post Office's Increase in Postage for Books</p>
<p>The Book Industry Association sent a telegram to Nanjing and Shanghai, saying: To President Jiang of Nanjing, and Committee Members Cai Ziming and Li Shizeng of Shanghai, This time the post office has increased postage, with first-class mail increasing by 50%, and books by 100% in areas where trains are not available inland, and 200% in Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, which increases the burden on book buyers and hinders cultural education. The postal service in the three northeastern provinces is temporarily not increased. Why is the northeast favored and the western regions neglected? This goes against the government's intention to develop the west and recover the northeast. We earnestly request that the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee be proposed to urge the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Communications to cancel it immediately. Education is fortunate, the western regions are fortunate. Shanghai Book Industry Association, in gratitude.</p>

<p>Miss Miao Degu, the granddaughter of former National Government Counselor Miao Jianhong, and her friends Ding Shuying, Yang Huiying, Yang Feixia, Shen Huiming, Pan Jun, Lu Huiying, and Wu Yueying, recently regretted that the Chinese people in the household goods, and even food, etc., did not choose domestic products but used foreign products, and the outflow of profits was astonishing. Therefore, domestic products were excluded from the market, and domestic factories could not be revitalized. If we do not urgently seek rescue, the future of our country's industry is of great importance. Therefore, the establishment of the Household National Products Promotion League was initiated. Yesterday, the first preparatory meeting was held at Miao's private residence on Yijia Pan Road. At that time, Miao Beiyu, Yang Huiying, and Pan were elected as members of the drafting committee of the charter and declaration, and Miao Zhijie, a member of the National Endeavor Association, was hired as a consultant to assist in actively preparing for everything.</p>

<p>Attention to Sanitation within the Concession</p>
<p>Advising Land Owners to Enclose Vacant Lots with Fences</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council has always paid attention to sanitation within the concession. Now that the Shanghai Incident has passed and summer is approaching, it has issued a special notice to all business owners, asking them to assist the council in maintaining sanitation within the concession. The notice reads: "Regarding the matter of sanitation, the difficulties encountered by this council in maintaining health and sanitation within the concession may not be fully understood by the general public. In fact, this council is constantly striving for this goal. It has been found that the most important task for this council is to maintain the cleanliness of the numerous vacant lots within the new concession, as these vacant lots easily become breeding grounds for filth. Therefore, various departments of this council have repeatedly instructed people to enclose these vacant lots with fences. However, in practice, this has been very difficult, as there are many obstacles hindering progress. In some cases, the owners of the vacant lots often avoid meeting with us. In other cases, those who are contacted are merely tenants, and these tenants all make excuses, claiming that the real owners should be responsible for enclosing the vacant lots with fences, and they refuse the council's requests. This results in futile back-and-forth correspondence with little success. Sometimes, the vacant lots are jointly owned by three or four owners, and these owners have differing opinions and do not respond to the council's letters. Therefore, the biggest obstacle encountered by this council is the excessive disregard of the owners of vacant lots for issues related to public health. They are unable or unwilling to understand that enclosing the vacant lots, while being their duty, is also in their own interest. However, despite these many difficulties, this council has been able to achieve commendable success. By the end of 1931, only a few vacant lots in this concession remained unenclosed. Unfortunately, in the past year and a half, the council's work of the past three years has been almost completely destroyed. This is because various departments of this council are currently focusing on defense work, and as a result, the monitoring efforts have not been comprehensive, leading to the complete disappearance of these fences when refugees flooded the concession. Now, this fencing work will continue, as such work is urgently needed at a time when general health conditions are poor and summer is approaching. However, in order to quickly achieve our goals, the cooperation of all landowners with this council is essential. This council sincerely hopes that all landowners will understand that enclosing vacant lots, while being in the public interest, is also in their own personal interest, as this type of fencing is indeed the most effective guarantee against others dumping garbage on their vacant lots, as well as digging soil, and other various acts of theft. In order to prevent people from using this bamboo as fuel, this council intends to use tarred bamboo as fencing material, so that the odor emitted when the bamboo is burned may prevent many people from using it for cooking. As for the council's supervision work, it should also be strengthened, and offenders should be severely punished as a warning to others. Furthermore, this council also hopes that all residents will pay attention and not pile garbage on roads or vacant lots, and that garbage bins should be placed according to regulations and moved to the side of the road when garbage trucks pass by for easy removal. In addition, there are many residents who do not supervise their servants when they dump garbage, and then turn around and criticize this council. In fact, such criticism should be directed at them. Therefore, this council believes that regarding the issue of improving health and cleanliness, if all residents do not understand the importance of public cooperation, then even the efforts of this council will be in vain. However, we hope that as long as we raise the awareness of the Chinese and foreign residents in the concession about the need for public cooperation, we can be sure of rapid improvement, which would be fortunate."</p>

<p>The women's circles in Shanghai, in view of the large number of unemployed female workers due to the recent Shanghai war, which has greatly affected the society's livelihood, have specially founded a Women's Livelihood Cooperative at the end of Hongqing Lane on Xinza Road. The content of its organization is very detailed. A sewing department has now been established, specializing in making Chinese and Western clothing, commercial banners, and daily household items. Because of the low labor costs and exquisite craftsmanship, it is quite popular in society, and the cooperative's business is exceptionally developed. The current president is Ms. Luo Zhi.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>In order to expand, the cooperative is recruiting members, enrolling students, and hiring Chinese and Western technicians to teach machine sewing skills to cultivate a large number of ladies to meet the urgent needs. Its regulations will be sent upon request by letter.</p>

<p>Practical Night School The Shanghai Practical Vocational Supplementary Night School, in view of the importance of providing relief to unemployed youth after the war, has already opened a course in engineering drawing, with departments in architectural drawing, mechanical drawing, and surveying and mapping. It is the first vocational supplementary night school of its kind in the country. The course now employs over ten experts, including Mr. Huang Ri, an architect from the Shanghai Hexing Company, and Professor Wang Qin of the Civil Engineering Department of Daxia University. Currently, the number of students enrolled in the architectural drawing department, both face-to-face and correspondence courses, is already in the hundreds, and it is extremely developed. The graduation period is not long, the tuition is low, and the results are significant. Those who are concerned about their own careers after the war can contact Mr. Gan Chunquan, the principal of the school, at the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center at No. 80 Hualong Road, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yucai Public School The Shanghai Municipal Council Yucai Public School on Shanhai Pass Road, originally scheduled to hold its sports meet on the 22nd of this month, postponed it to the 29th due to rain. Now, due to continuous rain and the muddy sports field, which is unsuitable for sports, it has been postponed again to the 6th of next month.</p>
<h3 id="e103">News from Various Native Place Associations <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong The number of Guangdong people living in Shanghai is approximately 300,000. The most prominent among their organizations are the Guangzhao Public Association, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, and the Chaozhou Native Place Association. However, these are all limited to local affairs and the business community. It can be said that there is no organization that represents all districts and sectors of the province. After the outbreak of the war in northern Shanghai, some Guangdong people organized the Guangdong Native Place Relief Association, which specialized in relief and comfort activities. However, it was later disbanded due to certain circumstances. In February, Guangdong people Wen Zongyao, Feng Shaoshan, Wu Tiecheng, Ma Chaojun, Chen Fumu, Zheng Hongnian, Mai Chaochu, Gao Guangjing, and others gathered various Guangdong organizations and people from all walks of life in Shanghai to initiate a unified Guangdong Native Place Association. After preparations up to now, it has been filed with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, becoming a legal organization. The registration of members of the association is also extremely enthusiastic. Its organizational method is quite special, as it is difficult to convene a general meeting of all members due to the large number of people. Therefore, every 200 people form a branch association, and the branch association representatives organize the executive body, which should be the executive committee. Currently, the elected executive committee members include Gao Chengyuan, Fang Diffei, Yuan Liangzou, Zhu Yecang, Lin Junxian, Xia Shiqing, Huo Shi, Liu Zichong, Chen Yien, Chen Yinong, Fu Shunan, Tang Diffei, etc. The inaugural meeting will be held today at the China Society on Weihaiwei Road, and the executive committee members will also take office at the same time.</p>
<p>Kunshan The Kunshan Native Place Association in Shanghai, because farmers in the area previously used grain as collateral to the Farmers Bank to redeem it, encountered war, and the bank, fearing that the collateral would be unsecured, sold all the pledged rice. Now, at this time of year when the new crop is not yet available, farmers have funds to redeem the rice, but the rice is not available, which has a significant impact. Therefore, the association urgently telegraphed the provincial and county governments and the county security committee, requesting that the bank be ordered to quickly use the proceeds from the sale of the pledged rice to purchase rice for redemption in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Love Triangle Struggle <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Shooting at the Far East Hotel</p>
<p>The Trouble Caused by Lao Ba of Yanchun Lou</p>
<p>Gao Liansheng Gathered a Crowd and Fired Six Shots</p>
<p>Qi Laohu Wounded But Not Killed</p>
<p>This Kind of Spirit Should Go to the Front Lines</p>
<p>At 9:20 PM on March 20th of this year, a brawl occurred in the billiard room of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road due to a love triangle. At the time, Qi Laohu was shot in six places and was sent to Renji Hospital by his companions. The case was reported to the Old Zha Gate Police Station for the arrest of the criminals. Until the previous day, after Qi Laohu learned that Yang Jian (also known as Xiao Bao or Xiao Yang), a Ningbo native who was present at the shooting, was about to escape to Hankou on the Jiangxin steamer, he reported it to the police station. Detective Feng Xiushan, together with detectives from the French Police Station, went to the Jiangxin steamer at the Sixteen Pu Wharf, arrested Yang, and brought him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One, where Judge Zhou Hanting took the stand for interrogation. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that the police station was now prosecuting the defendant based on Article 282, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for attempted murder. It was found that this case occurred on the night of March 20th, when the fugitives Gao Liansheng, Wu Jiming, Xiao Suzhou, etc., went to the billiard room of the Far East Hotel, dragged Qi Laohu into the kitchen, and fired six shots from their guns, causing Qi to be hit by six bullets and fall to the ground. Qi's friend Gao Derong sent him to Renji Hospital and reported it to the police station. At that time, the police station immediately sent detectives to investigate. However, Qi was unwilling to reveal the truth. The next day, Qi was transferred to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, the injuries were minor, and he was discharged from the hospital after more than ten days of treatment. Meanwhile, Detective You A'gen learned that the cause of the incident was that Qi Laohu and Gao Liansheng were both in love with Lao Ba, a prostitute at No. 304 Huile Lane, and therefore, a love rivalry arose. When the police station went to Huile Lane to investigate, Lao Ba had moved to the French Concession for business. However, the victim in this case, Qi Laohu, is also an undesirable element in the jurisdiction of the Huishi Police Station. His father used to be Chinese Police Officer No. 415 in the police station. Therefore, when the detectives investigated Qi, he was unwilling to tell the truth. It was not until yesterday that Qi reported to the police station that Yang Jian, who was related to the shooting, was currently on the Jiangxin steamer, intending to escape to Hankou. The police station then arrested Yang. It was found that Yang was Gao Liansheng's follower, etc. According to Qi Laohu, he was related to Gao Liansheng. Gao's original name was Zhu Nansheng, and he was intimate with Yan Chun Lou's Lao Ba, a prostitute in Qunyufang. I didn't know about it at first, so I called for Lao Ba. Later, Gao stated to me that Lao Ba was his lover and asked me not to call for her again. I agreed. Until the night of March 20th, I was playing billiards with my friend Gao Derong at the Far East Hotel when I met Gao Liansheng, who asked me to talk. I went with him, and as soon as I got to the elevator, I saw the defendant and Wu Jiming each pull out a gun and fire six shots at me. I was injured and fell in the kitchen, etc. When questioned, the defendant Yang Jian confessed that on that day, Gao Liansheng gave me an ax and told me to go to the Far East to fight. I didn't know who I was going to fight, so I went with him. I saw that Gao had a gun. When we got to the Far East, I saw Gao call Qi Laohu away. Because I knew Qi, I didn't do anything and slipped out through the back door. Afterwards, Gao told me that because Qi had taken his mistress Lao Ba and often went out to rent rooms, he wanted to kill him. At that time, Gao gave me fifteen yuan to escape to the countryside, and Gao also escaped to Hankou. The previous day, Gao sent me a letter telling me to go to Hankou, so I was arrested on the Jiangxin steamer, etc. After Judge Zhou Hanting verified the facts, he ordered the defendant to be detained and interrogated again next Tuesday.</p>

<p>Zhang Meili's Lawsuit</p>
<p>Qi Sues Requesting Severance of Family Ties</p>
<p>Zhang Countersues Seeking Reimbursement of Living Expenses for Children, Etc.</p>
<p>Qi Rengxi, a politician from Ningbo who once founded the Guanhai Evening News, is currently 44 years old and resides at No. 72 Wanyi Lane, Luban Road, French Concession. He married Zhang Meifeng, also from Ningbo. In the tenth year of the Republic, when Qi was living in Tianjin, Meifeng fell ill. Her younger sister, Zhang Meili (currently 35 years old), went to Tianjin to take care of her sister and developed feelings for Qi. At that time, Qi requested that if his wife died, he would marry Meili as his successor. As a result, their love deepened day by day. Later, Qi's Xiehe Trading Company in Tianjin went bankrupt, and a lawsuit ensued. Meili spent a large sum of money to help Qi resolve the lawsuit. From then on, the two began to live together. Meifeng's illness gradually healed. Qi had told Meili that he was willing to divorce Meifeng and then formally marry her. However, he vaguely delayed it and did not carry it out. Nevertheless, they have been living together ever since and have had seven children. Last year, when Qi moved to Shanghai to run the Guanhai Evening News, Meifeng lived in Wanyi Lane, while Meili lived separately at No. 601 Lafayette Road. Recently, Qi became cold and neglectful towards Meili, causing her to feel resentful. This spring, Meili hired lawyers Li Zuyu and Wu Youyuan to file a criminal lawsuit with the Second Special District District Court, accusing Qi of immorality and abandonment. After the court held a hearing, it acquitted Qi. Zhang was not satisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which acquitted Qi on the abandonment charge and dismissed the remaining charges. Now, Qi has hired lawyers Sun Yuan and Xu Zuyan to sue Zhang Meili in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, alleging that she illegally detained and beat him and forced him to write a note, etc., requesting to sever family ties with Zhang. He cited Zhang Xianda and Liu Zhenfu, the doorman of Wanyi Lane, as witnesses. The court issued a summons based on the complaint. Zhang Meili still hired lawyers Li and Wu to defend her and filed a countersuit seeking reimbursement of living expenses for her children, etc. The afternoon before last, Judge Qu Z onceze held a further hearing in Civil Division Three. First, witness Liu Zhenfu testified that he had seen the plaintiff return home at 11 PM on January 2nd, with his clothes disheveled, bald-headed, and barefoot. I asked his servant to open the door for him. I don't know anything else. The plaintiff Qi Rengxi claimed that from December 31st of last year to January 2nd of this year, he was confined by Zhang Meili in her house on Lafayette Road for two days and two nights, with the front and back doors locked. On the night of the 2nd, I escaped by climbing from the window to the iron gate. Because my clothes were locked up, I wore an old robe, went home bald-headed and barefoot. I was beaten once at home, which Zhang Xianda saw, and once at her third sister Zhang Meiling's house on Laobazi Road. Her third sister also helped beat me and forced me to write a note about the money. No one saw it. I also had to write that he was the one who ran the Guanhai Evening News and took away important documents from the Guanhai Evening News. Witness Zhang Xianda runs a pharmacy. Her third sister, Zhang Meiling, is a doctor. They have an affair and are unwilling to testify in court, etc. When Zhang Meili was questioned, she detailed how she went to Tianjin in May of the 15th year of the Republic to visit her sick sister and was induced to live with him until he abandoned her now. The Guanhai Evening News was founded in Shanghai under the orders of people in the government for the sake of her husband's face, so it was outwardly said that he was running it, etc. Her agent, lawyer Li, briefly stated the intent of the countersuit and asked for legal aid. The court stated that although the main lawsuit was clear, there was still the issue of the counterclaim and legal aid, and adjourned the hearing until the aid issue had been investigated and adjudicated before proceeding with the hearing.</p>

<p>Confesses to Three Kidnappings</p>
<p>Leading to the Arrest of Many More Bandits</p>
<p>Gu A'ming Vigorously Denies Being Falsely Implicated</p>
<p>The Zha Gate Police Station recently arrested the bandits Chen A'bing and Chen Renshou, etc., who robbed a family's property on Chengdu Road. According to their confession, there was still an accomplice named Tianfu hiding somewhere. Detective Shao Jingfan and others went to the vicinity of Deyu Lane on Guangxi Road and captured Tianfu. The bandit took the opportunity to snatch a handgun and shot Detective Shao, who was shot dead on the spot by Chinese Police Officer No. 109. This has already been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Chen Renshou has confessed to three kidnapping cases in previous years. He stated that the first time, he kidnapped a bank employee on Guizhou Road. However, because the hostage resisted strongly, he shot and killed the hostage on the spot. The second time, it was near the small vegetable market on Tiema Road (i.e., North Henan Road). The person kidnapped was also a banker named Lou Ken zai. However, he was only taken to Tongfu Road before being snatched away by another kidnapping gang. He received over 800 yuan in compensation from that gang. The third time, he kidnapped a Shi surname on Wu Ma Road. After two weeks, the family prepared money and redeemed him at the Jue Lu Hotel. He received 2,600 yuan. Gu A'ming was involved in all three cases except for the Guizhou Road case and said that Gu is currently hiding at No. 241 Fuzhou Road. Chinese and Western detectives then went to the address to arrest him the day before last. Gu was in the room with Hua Darong, so they were arrested together. A license plate No. 1915 was also found and taken back to the police station. It was found that Hua had also committed other crimes and was wanted by the police station. The owner of the license plate had fled recently due to a misappropriation case. Furthermore, according to Gu A'ming's confession, there were several accomplices. Chinese and Western detectives then went to Xizang Road to investigate, but only captured Fang Xiaomao. They then searched a room in the Far East Hotel for firearms based on Gu's confession, but found nothing. Zhao Jinsheng and Tang Weizhi, who were in the room, were arrested. Before long, Wang Mao'er visited Fang and was also arrested by the detectives stationed there and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were all escorted to the First Special District District Court. Judge Wu Tingqi conducted the preliminary hearing. The police station also escorted Chen Renshou to the court for cross-examination. First, the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the circumstances of the case and requested that Chen Renshou and Gu A'ming be questioned about the kidnapping case and then adjourned so that the police station could continue to investigate. Judge Wu then questioned Chen Renshou, who confessed to the three kidnapping cases one by one, saying that Gu A'ming had arranged both the Tiema Road and Wu Ma Road Qinghefang cases and that the guns were also issued by Gu, etc. However, Gu absolutely denied it, claiming that he had helped the police station solve major cases such as the robbery of the Four Lines Preparation Warehouse in the past, which had caused the resentment of those people, and that they were now falsely implicating him in an attempt to retaliate. He hired lawyer Wu Linkun to defend him. Lawyer Wu then requested that the judge review the files of the various cases that Gu had helped solve in the past, which would prove that Gu had not committed any crimes. Judge Wu then ordered Gu A'ming and others to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Shishi Xinbao Labor Strike Yesterday's Report <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The labor strike at the Shishi Xinbao has been going on for nearly a month and has not yet been resolved. Yesterday, Mr. Ge Hecai and Mr. Feng Jifang of the Shanghai Municipal Industrial Workers' Association intervened in the mediation because the strike at the newspaper was prolonged and unresolved, which would be detrimental to social order. The labor side's attitude was still to restore the situation before April 2nd as a prerequisite, and all other matters could be discussed at leisure. The management side's attitude was tough and remained the same as before, so the mediation failed again. The labor side's petition to the administrative authorities and the letters of condolence from various sectors are recorded below:</p>
<p>Another Petition to the Social Affairs Bureau The petition is regarding the Shishi Xinbao's management's destruction of the labor movement and the dismissal of a large number of workers without cause, requesting a swift and severe halt to the matter. The union has reported on the 2nd of this month, the authorities of Shishi Xinbao, on the pretext of the "Da Wanbao Incident," closing the factory and expelling all the workers, etc. However, since the incident, almost a month has passed. Although the Bureau and various groups have mediated, the newspaper management has relied on its fearlessness and ignored them, resulting in a prolonged unresolved situation. The union's unemployed workers have been displaced and suffered the pain of unemployment in the aftermath of this war. The management, on the other hand, has used deceitful means to sophistically argue, fooling the authorities above and deceiving the society below, not hesitating to expose the ferocious face of a civilized capitalist. Taking advantage of the increased number of unemployed workers in the society, the management disregarded social order and security and dismissed a large number of workers in order to achieve its aim of destroying the labor movement and intensifying exploitation. The union, based on the principle of labor-management cooperation, has always been patient in order to seek a peaceful solution. We respectfully request that the Bureau swiftly mediate in order to achieve the goal of returning to work as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Publishing Industry Union Resigns from Mediation The Shanghai Municipal Publishing Industry Workers' Union Organizing Committee sent a letter to the newspaper industry union, resigning from the mediation. The letter reads: (Omitted above) The labor dispute in your union has been unresolved for a long time. Our union, not considering our own limitations, has engaged in mediation. Yesterday, we held discussions with the management representatives Xiong Shaohao and Ren Jinpin, etc., but they were unable to agree to the return to work and their attitude was resolute. We can only politely decline. We hope that your union will fight to the end and our union will be your support (omitted below).</p>
<p>The Silk Reeling Industry Union Sends Condolences The Shanghai Fourth District Silk Reeling Industry Workers' Union sent a letter of condolence, which reads: (Omitted above) Recently, we read in the newspapers that the Shishi Xinbao management, in this time of national crisis and hardship for the people, dared to use coercive tactics to destroy the organization of the labor union and even coerce the workers to reject mediation. The measures taken by the newspaper management have caused panic in society, which is regrettable. We hope that your union will fight with the spirit of the group and with justice, without giving in. Our unions are in the same boat, how can we stand idly by? We will resolutely lead all the members of the district to be your support and make vigorous efforts to deal with the Shishi Xinbao's management, who are stubborn and unwilling to repent (omitted below).</p>

<p>For Counterfeiting Trademarks and Defamation</p>
<p>Xiong Shaohao, the manager of Shishi Xinbao, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Dong Qimeng, the manager of Shishi Ribao in Fushen Lane, Zhengjia Muqiao, for counterfeiting trademarks and defamation, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide held a hearing in Criminal Division Two. The defendant failed to appear. Chinese Police Officer No. 1281 Jin Wanyun testified that he went to Zhengjia Muqiao to serve the summons yesterday, but the newspaper had already moved to No. 34 Ximen Road, French Concession. He went to the Shishi Ribao in the French Concession to notify them, and the newspaper stamped the summons and took it away. I don't know why they didn't come today. The plaintiff's agent lawyer then stated that Shishi Xinbao had registered with the Trademark Bureau and had also registered a joint trademark, Shishi Ribao, etc., which had been approved and publicly announced, granting them exclusive rights to the trademark and prohibiting others from using it. However, recently, Shishi Ribao was discovered, which not only infringed on Shishi Xinbao's joint trademark, but also the handwriting of the three characters "Shishi Bao" in its masthead was exactly the same as Shishi Xinbao. In order to seek peace and tranquility, the plaintiff sent a letter to the newspaper, asking them to change their newspaper name and demanding a reply within three days. However, they not only did not reply but also arbitrarily defamed them in the newspaper on April 9th, making unreasonable trouble. Therefore, we are suing them. Now that the defendant has been legally summoned and failed to appear without cause, we request that they be arrested. Judge Feng ordered that the case be adjourned and Dong summoned to court again for questioning.</p>

<p>The Shareholders are Judged to Have Unlimited Liability</p>
<p>The Zhengyi Bank at No. 62 Jiangxi Road declared bankruptcy on November 19th of last year, leaving behind a mountain of debt. The bank's creditor groups have filed lawsuits with the court. The relationship between the limited liability company and the unlimited liability company has been the subject of dispute between the two sides. This month, a portion of the creditor group, represented by Shen Changgeng and more than ten other firms of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, sued the bank's directors and supervisors Ye Hongying, Qi Yongqing, Sun Jingru, Wu Yinru, and others, totaling eleven people, for failing to settle the debts. They filed the lawsuit with the First Special District Court in Shanghai, arguing that the bank did not have a license from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and therefore could not be considered a limited liability company. They also cited the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's letter No. 9810 of the Commerce Department on January 13th (stating that the bank's license from the Ministry of Finance was a business license and could not be the basis for the bank's status as a legal entity. Although it had applied for registration with the former Beijing Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, it had not been approved and issued a license, and therefore could not be considered a registered company. Since the bank had not obtained the legal status of a limited liability company, it was legally required to bear unlimited liability), ordering the directors and supervisors to repay the debts. On the 25th, Judge Li Hu held court in the Eighth Division and ruled that the defendants Ye Hongying and others were jointly and severally liable for repaying the debts.</p>

<p>Sun Yunqing Accused by His Concubine</p>
<p>Demanding the Return of a Loan of Three Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>Sun Yunqing, currently residing at No. 5, Jing'an Temple Alley, Jing'an Temple Road, i.e., the owner of Qinglian Pavilion on the Fourth Avenue, is 66 years old. His concubine Jiang Cuiling, who was formerly his maid and is now 27 years old, filed a lawsuit against him in the First Special District Court for abuse. After the case was settled, Jiang sued again because Sun had borrowed 3,000 yuan of silver from her personal savings and had not returned it. Furthermore, Sun had issued a promissory note, so she commissioned lawyer Chen Bingxing to sue him in court, requesting a judgment for the return of the money. The preliminary hearing was presided over by Judge Zhou Renda, who ordered that Sun return the full amount to Jiang, with interest calculated at 8% per month. Sun, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday was the date for the hearing, and both parties appeared in court. According to Sun's testimony, he took Jiang as a concubine when she was 15 years old, at which time he gave her ten yuan a month for expenses. When she was 24 years old, he gave her thirty yuan a month. Later, because they were not used to living together, she demanded one hundred yuan a month and to live separately. Although the monthly allowance was increased to fifty yuan, she still felt it was not enough, and last year she even filed a lawsuit for abuse. Fortunately, the judge saw through her intentions and did not convict him. As for the alleged 3,000 yuan, there is no basis for it at all. He doesn't even know where the promissory note came from. The judge ordered him to sign his name on another piece of paper for examination. According to Jiang Cuiling's statement, she was originally from Haimen. When she was 11 years old, she was abducted and sold to the Sun family. At 15, she was forced to become a concubine. At that time, she was young and had no way to resist. The 3,000 yuan that was borrowed was when Sun joined a hui (rotating credit association) for 5,000 yuan, and she also joined for half a share. After she received the money in the 18th year of the Republic of China, Sun borrowed it. On the day she received the money from the hui, she gave him 2,000 yuan, and the next day she paid him another 500 yuan, plus 500 yuan that had been borrowed piecemeal in the past, for a total of 3,000 yuan. At that time, he wrote a promissory note, and so on. The case is now awaiting examination of Sun Yunqing's handwriting before a date is set for a retrial.</p>

<p>The Wounded Maid Dies</p>
<p>On the 27th of this month, at approximately 5:00 AM, three or four kidnappers went to the home of Wang Zilin, a local resident at No. 722, Yongji Lane, Weihaiwei Road, and abducted his four-year-old son, Fu Hai. The bandits also shot and wounded Wang in the leg and the maid Li Tao (38 years old) in the waist. They then escaped in a car that was parked nearby, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. The two wounded individuals were sent to the hospital for treatment, but Li Tao died from her severe injuries at 12:00 AM that night. The Xinzha Police Station ordered detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the autopsy room on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the First Special District Court arrived at the autopsy room to examine the body. He sat in the official position and questioned Yu Lianquan, who stated that he and Wang Zilin were living together. At the time, Yu saw two bandits enter. One bandit snatched the child, and the other bandit guarded Yu and several others. Li Tao tried to leave, but was shot three or four times by the bandit, all hitting vital points, and so on. After obtaining the statement, Guo ordered an autopsy, which confirmed that Li Tao died from gunshot wounds inflicted by bandits. The body was released to Lian Runsheng to be prepared for burial. The police station is strictly pursuing the arrest of the fleeing bandits to bring them to justice.</p>

<p>The Dongting Dongshan Native Association in Shanghai held a temporary general meeting of all members the day before yesterday at 2:00 PM. Over a hundred people attended, including Qi Qisun, Wang Yizhai, and others. Zhu Xianhuai chaired the meeting, and Jiang Zhixiang recorded the minutes. The meeting began as usual. First, Chairman Zhu reported on the purpose of the meeting. Then, the secretary read the revised constitution, which was revised item by item by the committee members and voted on by the public. It was passed. Next, the issue of security in the native place was discussed. Chairman Zhu reported that bandits and robbers were rampant in Taihu Lake, and kidnapping cases were heard of daily. Residents could not sleep peacefully. He asked the public to discuss how to protect themselves. It was resolved to expand the local defense groups. Due to insufficient funds, the committee members were tasked with soliciting donations from fellow villagers in Shanghai to assist. Next, the case of soliciting members was discussed. It was decided that existing members would persuade fellow villagers in Shanghai to join as soon as possible, and a solicitation committee would be organized to actively promote membership. Finally, the issue of transportation in the native place was discussed. Xi Qisun, the general manager of Yufeng Shipping Company, reported on the spot that since the Shanghai War, bandits had been rampant in Taihu Lake, intercepting and robbing along the way, making travelers uneasy and disrupting transportation. It was difficult for fellow villagers to travel to and from Shanghai. He had built two new large gasoline boats that would travel daily between Suzhou and the native place, with special daily routes and discounted fares to show preferential treatment. Once they were completed and launched, the routes would be opened, he said. The public appreciated Xi's enthusiasm for the public welfare of his fellow villagers and the convenience of transportation, and they stood up to express their gratitude. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

<p>Anhui Native Association Provides Assistance</p>
<p>Zhang Yiru, from Anhui Province, was formerly a guiding committee member of the Fengyang County Party Headquarters. Last month, he came to Shanghai on official business to negotiate important matters. He stayed at the Wan Chun Gong business firm on the Fourth Avenue. On the 10th of this month, he was injured by a British public bus and sent to the hospital for treatment, but he died. His family member, Zhang Lanjie, received a telegram and rushed to Shanghai to handle the funeral arrangements. The body has been collected by the charity hall. Because the family is unfamiliar with the area and has no relatives, they specially requested assistance from the Anhui Native Association. In addition to sending a letter to the General Inspectorate of the Police, requesting that a public prosecution be initiated, and to the British Public Bus Company, requesting compensation for the loss of life, the association also hired lawyer Li Ming to file a lawsuit on their behalf.</p>

Zhang saw that the fire was out of control and quickly took off his coat and tried to smother the flames. Unexpectedly, sparks flew everywhere, and Zhang suffered severe burns all over his body. Later, the street patrol arrived and sent Zhang and the car to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The car was completely destroyed by the fire.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Extortion Letter Sent by a Relative of a Relative <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Weixin's Wife Recognizes the Sender</p>
<p>Yang Guisheng Resorts to Extortion Due to Unemployment</p>
<p>Zhu Weixin, the owner of Yu Kang Southern Goods Store located outside the Dadongmen gate in Nanshi, is a local resident. Due to his prosperous business, he has accumulated some savings. His family lives at No. 115, Gaoxiangtou Street, Xiaonanmen. Since last year, Zhu has repeatedly received threatening letters, which he ignored. On the 25th of this month, he received another such letter. Upon opening it, he found that it was signed "Yi Zhi Mei" (a chivalrous thief from the Qing Dynasty), stating that due to urgent needs, he was borrowing 500 yuan from Zhu. He requested that the money be wrapped in old newspaper and placed in a trash can at the entrance of a certain alley on Sangyuan Street at around 7:00 PM on the 27th, without fail. If Zhu did not comply, he would resort to drastic measures. He cited the example of Zhao Tieqiao, the former director-general of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, who, despite having great power, ignored the threatening letter and ended up taking "hygiene pills" (committing suicide). The letter urged Zhu not to make the same mistake. Zhu immediately reported the matter to the police at the Third Precinct of the First District. At around 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, the police first wrapped some old paper and placed it in a trash can at the entrance of a small alley on Sangyuan Street. At around 8:00 PM, a man came along, reached into the trash can, and took the paper package. The police officers, who were lying in wait around, rushed up and arrested him. During the preliminary interrogation by the precinct chief, the man confessed that his name was Yang Guisheng, 29 years old, from Huzhou. He used to be in the southern goods business, but he had been unemployed for a long time and was having financial difficulties, so he resorted to this measure. He begged for leniency. The police then sent for Zhu's wife to identify the suspect. She recognized the extortionist as a relative of Yan Zongtang, who lived at No. 96, Wanjuma Tou. They were previously acquainted, which came as a great shock. The police, regarding the matter as an extortion attempt, immediately prepared a report and submitted it to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e117">General Meeting of Taoyuan Fang Tenants <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The tenants of Taoyuan Fang on Qipu Road, Hongkou, held a general meeting the day before yesterday at the Heshan Native Association in the fang. Over a hundred people attended. Feng Biao chaired the meeting. After the report was given, the discussion began, and the following cases were resolved: (1) Regarding the rent payment method for this fang: (Resolution) (A) Follow the resolution of the Shanghai Citizens' United Conference. The tenants of this fang are exempt from rent for three months. (B) Refer to the method of Junyi Lane on Ai'erjin Road, and from now on, calculate the rent at 80% of the original amount. Qipu Road was in contact with the two armies during the war, as evidenced by the records in the Shanghai newspapers of that time. Moreover, the Junyi Lane police station never lost its police power, whereas this fang did. Judging from the facts, the dangerous situation in this fang at that time was even worse. (C) According to the law of nature, rights and obligations are relative. Property owners in Shanghai do their best to ensure the safety and interests of residents. However, the facilities in this fang are inferior to others. For example, iron gates are not installed, resulting in easy access for thieves, and thefts are frequent. The tap water is damaged, the front and back doors are sometimes ineffective and cannot be closed, and there are leaks, etc. The landlord has always ignored these issues. From now on, the landlord should be requested to earnestly improve the aforementioned deficiencies and facilities to comply with the law and ensure the peace of the residents. (D) There is only one watchman, who only patrols the lane during the day. By dusk, he is gone. This is equivalent to having no watchman at all. From now on, the landlord should be requested to hire gatekeepers at the entrances of the east and west main lanes to control the entry and exit of residents late at night and to be responsible for opening and closing the gates. The executive committee should first send a letter to the landlord, arguing the case on the basis of reason. Until the negotiations are resolved, all rent payments will be temporarily suspended. (2) It was found that during the war, the Shanghai Municipal Council did not send patrols to patrol the streets of this fang, and the safety of the residents was completely disregarded. There have been multiple cases of theft and arson by plainclothes agents in this fang. (Resolution) Send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, requesting them to ask the Shanghai Municipal Council to exempt the spring municipal general donation (i.e., patrol donation) to provide relief. Before the issue of donation payment is resolved, if the Shanghai Municipal Council sends someone to collect the donation, the summer donation should be paid, but the spring donation should be unanimously refused to ensure uniformity. (If the spring donation has already been paid, it should be deducted from the summer donation.) (3) Elect seven executive committee members. (The elected members) Qian Changcui, Li Zhuting, Feng Biao, Zhao Yaoting, Liu Wenwu, Xu Muxian, Cao Zhuqing (Remaining cases omitted)</p>

<p>Situation Still Not Stable</p>
<p>Copper Coins Show New High Price... 420,500 Cash per Thousand</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign interest rate market was slightly calmer than before, but transactions were few. The future trend is still unstable, and it is difficult to guarantee that there will not be another price drop. The source is still uninterrupted, which is worrying. The interest rate for both the morning and afternoon markets was seven mace, which was half a mace higher than the previous day. The amount of remittance notes made was 590,000 in the morning market and 300,500 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 47,000 in the morning market and 15,000 in the afternoon market. Bank trading was 400,000 in the morning mutual market and 250,000 in the afternoon mutual market. More than 800,000 was collected and cleared in foreign accounts by various banks. The silver dismantling rate remained at one mace in both markets, with no change. The transaction of dismantling notes was more than 2.1 million in both markets. Bank collections and clearings totaled more than 3.9 million for foreign merchants and more than 4.1 million for Chinese merchants. More than 4 million was collected and cleared for foreign exchange, goods, customs duties, and mortgage remittances, more than 2 million was settled, and more than 1 million was settled for mortgages. More than 5.3 million was collected and cleared for foreign public notes from money shops, more than 31 million was collected and cleared for silver public notes, more than 1.5 million was collected and cleared for foreign transfer charges, more than 2.7 million was collected and cleared for silver transfer charges, more than 300,000 was traded in small money shops, and the source of customer routes was 600,000 to 700,000. There was no opening for stomach reduction. The early market price of auxiliary coins, Jiangnan small silver, was six mace. The afternoon market price decreased slightly by one li, calculated at five mace nine fen nine li. Transactions were only 2,500 jiao in the afternoon market. The early market price of Guangdong small silver was five mace nine fen seven li, and the afternoon market price was five mace nine fen six and a half li.

<h3 id="e124">Long-Term Deposit Interest Rate Agreed Upon <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The long-term domestic deposit interest rate has been publicly agreed upon at six taels and five mace, which is one tael and two and a half mace higher than the price at the end of last year. Because the current market situation is not as stable as before, the silver and money industry must settle long-term deposits, but long-term debts have not yet been recovered as desired. Therefore, the price of long-term debt interest this time must be at least above ten taels, and even old accounts should be above nine taels.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Gold Price Continues to Rise, Eight Taels <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Large Fluctuations Throughout the Day</p>
<p>Yesterday's Standard Gold Rose Sharply</p>
<p>The progress of the steps was rapid, and the driving force was not weak, often with two or three taels to eight or nine taels per board. The total for the day was thirteen taels. Looking back, the price continued to rise by eight taels. The buying and selling of each broker varied. As for the divergent trend of the silver market, the British price rose and the American price fell. The initial opening seemed weak, but the buyers were active. Moreover, with the exchange rate, both official and unofficial, being good, the trend was upward. Suddenly, foreign news reported that Canada was purchasing a large number of silver bars to add to the minting of silver auxiliary coins in preparation for a gold and silver standard. Rumors also circulated that silver prices would be discussed again. Because of this, the market situation faltered, and selling was still strong. By noon, the market recovered, showing vigor. The shorts were covering their positions, and the exchange rate was tight, which boosted confidence. The price almost increased by ten taels. The afternoon market was even better, and the price had already exceeded 730 taels. The result was more than twenty taels. The outlook is still optimistic. The daily situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Morning Market Once Plunged</p>
<p>The six-month opening in the morning market fell slightly by one tael and two mace to 719 taels and five mace. Large bars rose by three sixteenths, and the silver price fell by one eighth. Private telegrams did not change. Yuhe and Yuanheng and others sold. Then, the near-term exchange rate was approximately 3125, and it immediately fell to eighteen taels and two mace. Suddenly, Mitsui bought July 25, and Yi Yuhang, Heng Yuxing, Dadecheng, Bingxing and others entered the market and bought, immediately rising by eight taels. At 9:20 AM, it was 26 taels and five mace. However, Yuanmao Yong, Tong Taichang, and the Dalian gang unloaded. Also, peers traded August US dollars at 31 yuan, so when the British gold was announced, it was 24 taels and two mace. The listed price of British and American currencies each decreased by 125, actually due to the rise in exchange rates. At that time, Richang, Yuhe, Tianfeng, Yongzhi, Fengyong, and others bought in. In just a few minutes, the price increased to 28 taels, then fell slightly by three taels. There was a fluctuation of more than one tael in an instant. At 10:00 AM, rumors suddenly spread that Canada was purchasing silver to mint coins, and at the same time, there was news of a US silver meeting. This caused panic among peers. Also, the US dollar was slightly stronger, closing at 31 yuan. The Bombay telegram quoted shillings, so the gold price fell by six taels, to 20 taels and five mace at around 10:30 AM. Suddenly, a good trend reappeared. The exchange rate did not loosen, and the bank's buying appetite was not bad. August US dollars were 875, June 75, and British gold 25. In particular, Yuanheng, Fuyu, Liangxing, Zhifengyong, Yuhe, Fuchang, Yiyu, and others rushed in. The general shorts took the opportunity to cover their positions, so the price soared, rising more than it fell, a total of nine taels. It reached 29 taels and a half at 11:30 AM. It fell by three taels and zero mace due to the unremitting selling intentions of Yifeng and Yuanheng, and was 26 taels and two mace at 11:45 AM. The noon close was 27 taels and three mace, and the announced price was changed to 790 taels, calculated at 60 taels to 70 taels. In the afternoon, it was 63 to 4 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Exceeded 30 Taels</p>
<p>The reopening price in the afternoon market was 27 taels and a half, then from 8 taels and three mace to 7 taels. However, buyers were brave, including Yuanmao Yong, Yifeng Yong, Zhifeng Ji, Dadecheng, etc., so the price jumped by four taels and zero mace, a new high price of 31 taels and two mace at 2:20 PM. The May US dollar closed at only 30 yuan 625, and the British gold was 1875. Subsequently, Guangbang Yifeng and Dadecheng Hongkang Yong goods, etc., tended to unload, so the price was suppressed by more than three taels.

<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 28th reported that the near-term price of large silver bars was 16 pence 875, which was three one-thousandths and one hundred and twenty-fifths lower than the previous day, and the far-term price was 17 pence, which was two one-thousandths and one hundred and twenty-fifths lower. The London exchange rate for New York was three dollars and sixty-six and a half cents, which was five hundredths higher.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Both Official and Unofficial Foreign Exchange Tightened <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American exchange rates suddenly rebounded, and the Shanghai market tightened as a result. HSBC's listed price decreased by half a grade, with British gold at 125, for one shilling and eight pence, and US dollars at 125, for 30 yuan and 375. There was no change in Hong Kong, which was 76 taels and 625. The Indian exchange rate decreased slightly by one yuan, the French franc increased by one yuan, the German exchange rate increased by 25, the Japanese yen decreased slightly by 25, and the Singapore dollar increased by 75. The domestic British gold should be profitable, and the US dollar should not be loose, with a better trend. The gold price exceeded 730 taels, which led to this situation. It was firm after being flat in the morning and then fell, but was still tight at noon and steady in the afternoon. As a result, compared to the previous noon, the British gold decreased by 1875 and the US dollar decreased by 3125. The trading of Chinese merchants was still enthusiastic, with a total of 70,000 to 80,000 pounds of British gold traded, mostly hedging. The Bombay telegram sold August, and the US dollars totaled about 1 million yuan. Chengfengyong, Fuchang, and the Dalian gang had quite a few short positions, and the strips were hedged out. However, Citibank sold June contracts. The banks also did a lot of business with each other.</p>
<p>The domestic British exchange rate fluctuated by 1875 for the entire day, from a selling price of one shilling eight pence 3125 to 375 in the morning market, and a buying price of one shilling eight pence 375 to 4375. Zhongfu sold May 3125, Mike sold 25, Mitsui bought July 25, Shanghai bought August 25 (Bombay orders), Andar bought July 25. The noon closing price was one shilling eight pence 125 to 1875, and the buying price was plus 0625.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3 id="e128">Bond Options Rebound by One Yuan <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Futures Swap to be Handled Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, during the suspension period, must swap the existing futures transactions of various bonds again. It has been scheduled to be handled today. The principal and interest coupons for this month's bonds are still collected by the seller, but they must be calculated according to the calculations of both the buyer and the seller, so the calculation is slightly more complicated than before. As for yesterday's unofficial market, the diplomatic news continued to be good. The Sino-Japanese negotiations on the Shanghai case are expected to reopen. Confidence was very good, and demand was active. Compared to the previous day, the price continued to rise. The internal consolidation of six ratios rose by two yuan compared to the beginning of the week. The 20% Customs Consolidated Salt Tax and other taxes each rose by one yuan and five to six jiao. The remaining also increased by one yuan. A total of 50,000 yuan of bond futures were settled, with the Consolidated Tax accounting for 35,000 yuan, and 1920s Benevolence and 20% Customs each accounting for 5,000 yuan. The total existing futures transactions have now been reduced to 4.43 million yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Slump in Cold Cotton Yarn is Still Fierce <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market still shows no signs of improvement, truly affected by the financial stagnation. The market finds it difficult to develop, and with the busy farming season in the four rural areas gradually starting, there is even less hope for actual sales. Furthermore, stockpiling in this port is visibly increasing daily, causing people to feel more and more anxious. As for the Japanese factories, work is gradually resuming. They are urgently seeking a way out for yarn sales, making vigorous efforts secretly, which is a major disadvantage for Chinese yarn. The outlook remains bleak. However, a certain large merchant, having suffered significant losses from continuous declines, now seems slightly more resolute and is slightly firmer in his sales rhetoric. However, the actual demand in the market is extremely lacking, making it difficult for prices to stabilize. The price drop for unpopular yarns is still severe. According to statistics, all the various groups bought only 300 bales throughout the day, of which fellow traders took 45 bales, Sichuan took 50 bales, inland areas took 22 bales, Guangdong took 40 bales, and the northern groups took 115 bales. Prices for 20-count and 16-count yarns fell by 2.5 to 5 mace, and 32-count and 42-count yarn prices fell by 1 to 2 taels. It is said that Shenxin Yarn is still being released sporadically.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Factory Demand is Dull, Cotton Market is Desolate <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market situation remains desolate and lifeless, truly due to the dullness of current sales demand and the shutdown of various factories. Moreover, most factories bought plenty of foreign cotton last year. Coupled with the endless drop in yarn prices and the extreme tightness of credit, there is naturally no need to purchase. However, although gold prices have risen and exchange rates have narrowed, it is still difficult to stimulate purchasing interest from all parties. The Cotton Appraisal Association's meeting yesterday had no resolution and will continue inspection today. It is said that the content and procedures are extremely complicated and have not yet been finalized. Throughout the day, only Tongxing purchased 300 bales of American-grown new special cotton at a price of 33 taels, which was delivered to the factory as spot goods.</p>
<h3 id="e131">American Cotton Rises by Ten Points Per Pound <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was quiet and firm. It was firm initially due to short covering, and then fatigued due to weak spot sales. Futures rose by 8 to 10 points per pound, and spot prices rose by 10 points per pound. British cotton futures fell by 4 to 5 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton saw a stable market due to speculative buying, with Pingguer falling by 1 rupee and White Luo Creek falling by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left (telegram of the 27th).</p>

<h3 id="e132">Rice Market Shows Signs of Weakness <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Southern Market: Yesterday's rice market saw sources from Lane 30, and transactions between urban and rural areas became increasingly sluggish. Due to stable prices in the Northern Market and substantial inventories, sentiment was weak. Early rice opening prices fell by 1 jiao, and prices for thin rice continued to be cut due to abundant supply, especially for medium and lower grades. Yangdu pointed rice was sold as soon as it arrived, with prices as originally quoted.</p>
<p>Northern Market: Arrivals from various groups remain low, and river accumulation is still high. Most transactions in the market were for early and late rice, with prices for top-grade rice stable and lower grades nearly 1 jiao softer. Although the source of Changshu White Japonica and Yixing Kunshan rice is low, transactions are scarce, and prices remain unchanged. Due to the scarcity of Duyang Xian rice, the market continues to rise. Bian Yin Yuan to Source is weak, the sales market is dull, and the trend is hardening.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Imported Rice is Selling Well <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Although new shipments of imported rice arrived yesterday, this street and the customer groups have strong appetites, and the market price has improved by several points. The overall market, besides this street handling over 4,000 bags, the Jiangbei group also prepaid for nearly 1,000 bags, and the Han group handled over 1,000 bags. Besides the 5,000 bags of small twisted rice being released, over 1,000 bags of Saigon No. 1 rice were also handled by this street. People are optimistic, and if there is actual realization now and tomorrow, prices should improve further. The opening price for small twisted rice was 10 yuan and 0.025 yuan, medium and lower grades were 10 yuan to 9 yuan and 0.975 yuan, and Saigon No. 1 was 11 yuan and 0.3 yuan to 0.2 yuan. Futures transactions were 500 tons of small twisted rice for April and May, and 100 tons of Saigon No. 1 for April, with prices not significantly different from the previous market. The inventory and arrivals of Jiangxi Yuan rice are both lacking. Yesterday, over 100 bags of inventory were handled by this street, which was Zhongguan goods, priced at 13 yuan and 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Xinghua Group Purchases Existing Vermicelli <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's vermicelli market once again experienced a downturn in sentiment. The opening price for this month's spot goods was as low as 2 taels and 0.065 yuan. However, due to the healthy appetite of the Xinghua group, which purchased in the market, it rebounded. May's initial prices were also not good, opening at the same price as spot goods, but after customer groups purchased, it gradually rose. Until the closing price, spot goods rebounded to 2 taels and 0.075 yuan, and May to 2 taels and 0.08 yuan, roughly the same as the previous day. Currently, actual sales are relatively quiet, resembling a normal pullback. However, the naval factory's bid still requires a deduction of 2 taels and 0.15 yuan, so it is inevitable that sales will rebound strongly once they become active.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Grain Exchange Opens on June 6th <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Grain Exchange has been closed for three months since the market was suspended. Recently, with the situation turning towards peace, there is a collective effort to resume business. Yesterday at 3 PM, the Exchange's Board of Directors and Brokers' Association held a joint discussion. The initial plan was May 2nd, but due to procedural issues and the settlement of accounts at the end of May, it was deemed inconvenient. June 1st was close to the end of May, and there were concerns about accounting matters. Therefore, the final decision was to officially resume normal trading on June 6th, barring any other changes. It was also decided that after the opening, the oil cake documents of the oil factories would no longer be used as substitutes.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3 id="e136">Longkou Vermicelli Sales are Stagnant and Prices are Falling <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Longkou dried vermicelli arrivals have been scarce recently, but the market still has inventory. Because the various groups rarely visit the market, prices have fallen significantly, reaching 3 to 4 taels. It is also heard that newly produced goods from the origin will arrive soon. This old stock has been stored for a long time and is prone to becoming brittle and broken, so it is difficult to rebound. Yesterday, Zhuangxing sold it for 19.5 taels, and lower-grade goods for 19 taels.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Decline in the Piece Goods Market is Difficult to Reverse <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The local factory's cloth market is increasingly soft, and opening prices are exceptionally chaotic. Those in urgent need of funds are eager to sell, while others have varying prices due to cost considerations. Yesterday, 9-pound cloth fell below the 4 taels and 0.02 yuan mark. Jubao Basin and Three Chickens were both sold for 4 taels and 0.015 yuan, but Maofeng Five Blessings still required 4 taels and 0.035 yuan. Among 11-pound cloth, Caoniu was the lowest, selling for 4 taels and 0.06 yuan, but the spot goods are gradually becoming scarce. Three Deer and Three Rabbits require 7 mace. 16-pound cloth is also gradually falling, with Double Fish Jiqing selling for only 7 taels and 0.065 yuan, Double Dragon Hongfu both for 7 mace, and Samsung for 7 taels and 0.08 yuan. Fine cloth is uniformly soft, falling by 1 to 2 mace compared to last week. Fine twill has a more severe decline, falling by 4 to 5 mace. Ewo bleaching cloth has been falling sharply in recent days, falling by about 4 mace in three days, mainly due to the secret activities of Eastern goods bleaching cloth.</p>
<p>Western Piece Goods: The market is trending worse and worse. Spring and summer goods have completely stalled. Various groups in Tianjin, Sichuan, and other ports have not purchased for days. The sluggishness of sales has never been seen before. Goods arrive in Shanghai continuously from various firms, so prices can only fall and not rise. If there is no way to wholesale in the future, it will be difficult to turn things around for a while.</p>

<p>Over 290 barrels of tung oil and over 130 pieces of tobacco leaves were transported from Hankou.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Random Talk About the 19th Route Army <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Pillow Moon</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese War broke out in Shanghai, the prestige of the 19th Route Army has been known almost all over the world. Previously, while serving in Nanxiang, that place was the garrison of the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army. The division headquarters was located there. At that time, Nanxiang Station was crowded with officials. The division commander, Qu Shounian, the deputy division commander, Tan Qixiu, the chief of staff, Li Kuo, and other officers would often sit in the station master's office for a while. Occasionally, when discussing national affairs with people, they always regarded the fall of the Northeast as a disgrace to the entire nation. They especially considered the inability to recover the lost territory as a great regret. When the situation in Shanghai became tense, if asked whether there would be a war, they would say, "If the government does not want our army to resist foreign invaders, we will have no choice but to join the volunteer army ourselves." Their anger was evident in their words, showing that the army's determination to resist invasion had been around for a long time. Shedding iron blood in Shanghai, it is thought that the soldiers of the 19th Route Army have had their wish fulfilled, and they must regard it as the best thing a man can do.</p>

<p>— Tang Jiayu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Renjie, a Cantonese, is the son of Zhou Laoyi, a charitable philanthropist in Macau. He is intelligent and creative and has studied physics and chemistry for many years. He studied in Germany and France, specializing in machinery. Recently, seeing that the country's situation is critical and that without sophisticated weapons, it is impossible to resist strong enemies and seek survival, he used his skills to invent three types of military weapons. One is the Tyrant Machine, the second is the Wind and Fire Thunder, and the third is the Electric Shock Gun. The Tyrant Machine does not need fuel, nor does it need a driver. It is propelled entirely by the automatic machine inside the machine. It can fly high or travel far. When flying, it collides with airplanes, airships, or balloons. When traveling on land, it collides with tanks and armored vehicles. When traveling on water, it collides with warships. Once hit, the explosive power is so great that it is indestructible. Even if it misses, it can emit strong electric fire to burn it. The Wind and Fire Thunder contains explosives, submunitions, and molten steel agents. The explosive power is greater than any bomb. The Electric Shock Gun is shaped like an ink pen. The content is a pseudo-electric power propulsion mechanism. Its power is more than twice that of a revolver. All three types have been tested on a small scale by military agencies. The results were extremely effective. The drawings were previously presented to the National Government and received praise. Mr. Zhou, together with Li Jingtang, the brigade commander of the Cantonese Army, came to Hong Kong from Macau last month and plans to take a boat to Beijing within days to engage in manufacturing.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Sparrow Meetings in the Countryside <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>The name of the meeting is "Sparrow," but it is not like the gambling dens in Shanghai. It refers to people who are like birds. Sparrows are small birds that like to eat millet. They often fly to farmyards and threshing grounds to peck freely. When they are full, they fly away without asking who the owner is. The name of this meeting is both figurative and indicative. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the eastern countryside of Danyi was alarmed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was spared from the ravages of war. However, the indirect impact was that financial stagnation and the decline of all industries led to a desperate situation regarding the people's food. Therefore, this unprecedented "Sparrow Meeting" arose. First, there was Qing Mianhu among the villagers, who was well-off and generous with a chivalrous spirit. Although the name was Yunyun, he was not a character from the Baishuitan. He pitied the many poor households who had no food and stepped forward to declare to the local authorities that if relief measures were not devised, people would seize food from the wealthy, and the people would become like sparrows. He asked to start with himself. Poor households responded enthusiastically, and the rich were alarmed and willing to lend grain to others. Some vulgar people closed their doors and defended themselves. The "sparrow people" gathered and came, emptying their possessions. Some carried it on their shoulders or in buckets, while others carried it in their clothes bags. They looked at each other on the road and went away leaping for joy. The hoarders cried bitterly because the lost rice was the surplus that they usually endured hunger to save, never thinking that it would be used to encourage theft. However, looking at the market, the drinkers, gamblers, and opium addicts were even more delighted to compete. Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e141">Qinglai Hall Amidst the Flames of War <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Qingyun Road suffered heavy losses in the Shanghai War, and unfortunately, my humble abode was located there. My home and that of the famous painter Xu Chengbai were neighbors. After the burning and looting, there was nothing left. Then Chengbai's Qinglai Hall must also have been lost in the flames of war. When we were neighbors, we often visited each other. He did not abandon me and mistakenly regarded me as a connoisseur of painting. He spoke eloquently about the principles of painting and showed me several of his fine works, allowing me to comment on them. As far as I remember, the most exquisite and wonderful were the figure paintings. Imitating the late-year brushwork of Le Min, a beautiful woman stood with her hands clasped, with a horizontal branch of crimson plum attached above, having an air of not eating human food. The landscapes seemed to be made by Song and Yuan people. The Cloud Gorge and Long Pine Map was extremely meticulous. According to him, it took ten days to complete. It was truly a masterpiece. A small branch of plum blossoms, with only a few strokes, was elegant and unrestrained, full of charm. It was Zhao Zigu's hooking and dyeing method. Wu Chang said that plum blossoms should not be too realistic, as they would lose their refinement; they should not be too unreal, as they would lose their depiction. This painting was an image that was not like an image and an arrival that was not like an arrival. This was a good thing. Chengbai was quite proud of his work. If his works were indeed burned in this incident, then Chengbai's sorrow would be unbearable. Surviving amidst the flames of war, there has been no news. My startled soul has just settled, and I suddenly remember my old friend. I hereby write this as a memorial, and I wish the master of Qinglai Hall is well and the things in Qinglai Hall are well. That is my earnest prayer.</p>

<p>— Master of Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Ungratefulness Leads to Estrangement, Misfortune Meets a Haughty Guest's Anger; Deep Affection Settles a Plan, It's Hardest to Bear a Beauty's Kindness</p>
<p>An Yutian nodded and followed Liang Xiaoyun straight into her bedroom. Such a secluded and beautiful fairyland-like place, ordinary bumpkins and unrefined men could not easily step into. An Yutian had also entered here before to admire it. An exquisite Western-style copper bed was layered with fragrant quilts and brocade blankets, embroidered pillows and velvet rugs, still so gorgeous. A room full of Western-style wooden furniture in cream color, whether it was a dressing table, mirror cabinet, jade table, or silver screen, all had artistic patterns and harmonious colors. Furthermore, the walls were lined with pink Indian satin. At this time, there was not enough light in the room, and several Beijing silk-faced palace lantern-style electric lights were turned on, illuminating it with golden brilliance, making it even more radiant. Various elements merged together, creating a kind of dazzling light, charming color, and intoxicating fragrance, gathering into another kind of unbelievable and wonderfully indescribable magic power. It could make any male who stepped in have a strange feeling of entering a labyrinth, until his soul dissipated and his bones turned to dust, even wanting to stay here until death. An Yutian was very favored today, revisiting this sacred place. As soon as he reached the door, his worries and pains were blocked outside by the door gods, not allowed to come in and disturb him. And there was another god of joy leading him, as if he had arrived in another world of bliss. He was already somewhat ethereal, no longer aware of all the sufferings of the human world. Liang Xiaoyun lay weakly and lazily on the copper bed, pointing to a bright and dazzling lamp in the middle of the bed and saying to An Yutian, "Although I don't want to get addicted to this and be controlled by it in the long run, I also like to light this lamp and occasionally take a few puffs to relieve boredom. Especially when good friends come, sitting knee-to-knee facing the lamp, we can add a lot of interest to our heart-to-heart talks. You haven't been in good spirits these past two days, why don't you lie down and take a puff?" An Yutian, unable to control himself, could not refuse. Although he also quickly obeyed and lay down, he still shook his head and said, "I'm sorry. I, this poor student, am no longer worthy of such enjoyment. Even this place of yours seems unworthy of me to step into again. Today I am here specifically to say goodbye to you. In the future, not only should we distance ourselves in terms of actions, but even that bit of friendship should also be broken off from now on. This is limited by each person's divinely ordained circumstances, and there is no way to avoid it." As he spoke, he could not help but feel sad, and his eyes gradually became moist. Liang Xiaoyun, however, smiled indifferently and said, "Oh dear. You don't even want me, this friend, anymore? But I want to ask you, what do you plan to do by yourself?" As she spoke, she skillfully prepared a puff of smoke and handed it to An Yutian, who took it in one breath.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Zheng Xiaoxu's Political Views <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Gou</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend returned from Beiping and heard that Zheng Xiaoxu recently expressed his political views to a group of foxes and dogs. Because there were still a few people among the party members whose conscience had not been completely lost, they expressed dissatisfaction that the measures of the puppet government were completely devoid of freedom. Zheng Xiaoxu therefore expressed these political views. I heard that the most important principles and famous words were the following:</p>
<p>"In the past, Zhang Xun's restoration failed because his idea of rights was too developed. I now absolutely do not advocate rights, etc."</p>
<p>I think this sentence is very wonderful and philosophical. I have to discuss his political views briefly. The elements of establishing a country are originally based on rights. Therefore, the establishment of a country must be based on land, people, and sovereignty as the main conditions. Even those who have never studied political science mostly know this. Now that Zheng Xiaoxu "does not advocate rights," then what is left of the so-called "Manchukuo"?</p>
<p>I can indeed forgive Zheng Xiaoxu's difficulties and can elaborate on his meaning of "not advocating rights."</p>
<p>In Zheng Xiaoxu's view, I only need to restore the dynasty, I only need a place to kowtow, so the name is acceptable, a puppet is also acceptable, there is no need to insist on actual benefits. This meaning, on the surface, seems very philosophical, but his meaning is completely wrong, completely absurd.</p>
<p>Assuming he were truly philosophical, there would be no need to restore the dynasty. As long as political power is in hand, enlightened autocracy is acceptable, and a republican system is also acceptable. Why must he restore the dynasty? Assuming he restores a dynasty but "does not advocate rights," it is even easier to discuss. Just like when the former Emperor Xuantong was in Tianjin, others did not recognize Xuantong, but you still regarded him as Xuantong. Others did not regard him as the emperor, but you still regarded him as the emperor, going to court every day, kowtowing three times and nine times. The so-called "changing the reign title behind closed doors" restores your personal dynasty. That is also a method. Or, some say this trick, the old slave has already done it habitually, and it is not satisfying enough.</p>
<p>I will find him another philosophical method. The former Emperor Xuantong is already a ruler of a fallen country, like a defeated general, insufficient to establish prestige. It is better to invite a few old ancestors of the Qing Dynasty to come out, such as Tiancong, Tianming, Shunzhi, Kangxi, Yongzheng, Qianlong, Daoguang, Jiaqing, and other old emperors' ancestral tablets, and go to court every day. It would be more respectable and meaningful than going to court with Xuantong. If you say it is still not refreshing, it is not philosophical,</p>
<p>I will find him a more philosophical method. Zheng Xiaoxu, although he has no conscience at all, is still a descendant of the Yellow Emperor. It is better to simply invite the divine images of emperors of past dynasties, such as the Yellow Emperor, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Cheng, Kang, as well as Qin, Han, Jin, Tang, Song, Ming, etc. These are genuine, truly old emperors. Go to court every day to kowtow three times and nine times. That is not impossible. Why must he temporarily perform the dream of restoration in the Northeast in the hands of the Japanese?</p>
<p>If it is said that the ancestors of the past are dead, but how can Xuantong, a walking corpse, be considered alive? If it is said that the ancestors of the past are empty, then is your "restoration that does not advocate rights" not empty? May I ask, both being empty and both being puppets, why must this stage be collapsed in the hands of the Japanese?</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that Zheng Xiaoxu's restoration of "not advocating rights" is truly living in a drunken dream.</p>

<p>— Chen Baoren</p>
<p>The malarial rain and barbaric smoke raised the murderous aura, grieving, I carry blood and tears to mourn the heroes. The desolate home and country have endless hatred, I fear to hear the river's roar shaking the angry waves.</p>
<p>The scorched earth and withered bones look the same, the bullet marks still leave blood-red flowers. Where is the key to Wusong today? I sadly face the broken rainbow with tears.</p>
<p>I cannot bear to look back at the place of string and song, today I return and my tears flow. Countless buildings have returned to the fire, leaving only cold smoke on the seaside vegetation.</p>
<p>Deer chase each other in the Central Plains, and tigers covet them. I endure talking about sorrow and joy from the ashes. What is the true meaning of joy amidst sorrow? The chilly spring wind paints the cold horn.</p>

<h3 id="e146">An Engine That Doesn't Use a Boiler <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Zuo Qi</p>
<p>A new type of engine, powerful enough to break the 300-year-old method of power generation, will soon be offered to the British industrial world for trial, and its effectiveness will be observed. This new engine does not use a boiler or condenser and uses water instead of steam.</p>
<p>It is smaller in size than ordinary steam engines, but its power is greater, and there is no risk of explosion. The inventor is British engineer J.F.J. Malone. Mr. Malone has been researching this water engine (also called a water machine) for many years and has only recently achieved success.</p>
<p>Although this water engine and the steam engine that has been used for a long time both use water as a source of power, the steam engine must first turn the water into steam before it can perform any action. The water used in Malone's engine, however, remains in a liquid state even under pressure of several tons per square inch.</p>
<p>Malone has invented a novel heat exchanger, and it also has other advantages as follows: (1) Only a small amount of water is sufficient, so the volume of the engine can be reduced, taking up less space, making it especially convenient to install in places with a shortage of water; (2) It consumes less heat than other types of engines, and its outer shell remains cool; (3) The sound produced during operation and speed changes is quieter than that of traditional engines; (4) The parts are simpler and less prone to damage, requiring inspection only once every four years; (5) There is no need to wash the boiler frequently, no need for a water tester, and no risk of low water or sweat; (6) The management system is simpler than that of a steam engine; (7) There is no need for a venting device, as the water in the machine can be used for a long time without replacement; (8) All bearings remain cool and are self-lubricated by the water inside the machine.</p>
<p>Before the widespread use of electric motors, the hot air engine used in scientific laboratories was most similar to this water machine in its operating method. This water machine should use two water cylinders, each with a piston connected to the same shaft, with water moving back and forth between the two cylinders. One of the cylinders, which the inventor calls the "Thermodynamic Pile," has one end heated by the hot gas of a furnace to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, and the other end is continuously cooled by cold water or cold air to about 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The water in the cylinder circulates continuously in a set of concentric tubes, alternately being heated and cooled. These hot and cold water layers pass in opposite directions through adjacent layers at the bottom of the thermal pile, which are no more than one-hundredth of an inch thick. By this method, the heat from the furnace's hot gas can be transferred to the water extremely quickly, making it easy for the engine to run 250 times per minute.</p>
<p>When the water in the heat pile is heated, the pressure increases greatly, pushing part of the water into the second water cylinder, which in turn pushes the piston out, transmitting power to the machine parts. Afterward, all the water in the heat pile cools down, and the piston in the second water cylinder retracts as the pressure decreases. Thus, by using liquid instead of steam, a huge pressure change can be obtained with a smaller temperature change.</p>
<p>The inventor, Malone, claims: "A water engine locomotive can generate the same power as a superior steam locomotive with half the coal consumption."</p>
<p>Malone predicts that his new engine will be used in ships, trains, power plants, and other devices that use steam engines. This engine is especially suitable for remote areas with shortages of water and coal.</p>

<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>A guest familiar with the situation in Japan,</p>
<p>I met him at the hotel the day before yesterday. What he talked about was quite valuable to record, so I wrote it down on the left:</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this war, a type of "map bread" has become popular in Japanese markets. They imprint military maps on soft, clean bread, one of the three northeastern provinces and one of Shanghai. Mountains, rivers, and major transportation routes are all clearly listed and easily visible. From this, we can see their ambition to invade is undeniable. People are rushing to buy this kind of bread to reward the soldiers on the front lines. Hundreds of boxes of this map bread have been shipped to the Hongkou Huishan Wharf. Also, when they march at night, they often have a kind of phosphorous map, which is similar to a luminous watch. In the dark, it can emit a faint green light to indicate the terrain and all the key passes. All senior military officers carry one with them. It is said that this kind of military supply was invented by the Germans during the European War, and the Japanese are just imitating it.</p>
<p>The remains of soldiers are mostly packed in bags and transported back to Japan. It is said that a certain military officer, because there were too many corpses and it was cumbersome to transport them back, suggested boiling the corpses into oil to be used as a raw material for smoke bombs. What a brutal thing that is! I don't know if it will become a reality or not.</p>
<p>Alas!</p>
<h3 id="e148">Tomorrow <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Xiu</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, how many tomorrows there are! If I wait for tomorrow in my life, everything will be delayed." This song of "Tomorrow" has the same meaning as the Western proverb "What must be done today, do not leave until tomorrow." They are both sarcastic admonitions to people that whatever they think should be done, they should do it "decisively" and never put it off from today to tomorrow.</p>
<p>However, the two words "tomorrow" have almost become a cliché for Chinese people. Not only do ordinary adults and gentlemen only care about doing things as they please, regardless of whether "today" goes wrong, there is "tomorrow," and if tomorrow goes wrong, there is still "tomorrow," even the students who are studying hard and "racing against time" are like this. They get up late today, or their homework is far behind others, and they always use "I'll get up earlier tomorrow, I'll work harder tomorrow" to comfort and excuse themselves. They have forgotten the famous saying "My life has limits"! Alas, tomorrow, and tomorrow, how much precious time is wasted, and how many major events are delayed. What is written below is proof of a fact. Mr. S lived in ×× Lane in Zhabei. On the third day of the Shanghai Incident, when his roommates moved to the concession to take refuge, they repeatedly urged him to move as soon as possible. He also knew that he was in a dangerous area, but he was always lazy and procrastinated in everything. Even in that time of great anxiety, he still "put off from today to tomorrow" and did not take action immediately. But the ruthless artillery fire did not allow him to live to "tomorrow." With a bang, he was immediately invited to the ghost gate, and he became a victim of "tomorrow."</p>

<p>— Chen Rumin</p>
<p>When I leave school, the streets and alleys are always filled with the noisy voices of children with dirty faces and sweaty heads. They run around, doing meaningless things all day long. This is their life! No one to guide them! No one to manage them either.</p>
<p>It is a pity for these poor children who have dropped out of school. They have no money to study. The tall schools, they only have the fortune to look at them from outside the walls. Schools are originally places for aristocratic children, and knowledge is originally the monopoly of the bourgeoisie. Alas! Can the universalization of compulsory education ever be realized? This kind of grandstanding should be sung less!</p>
<p>Gentlemen in the administrative world! Please bow your heads and look at these millions of poor insects. Who has plundered their happiness and rights? They are regarded as the most humble things in the world, trampled on in this bustling market, groaning, begging, and dying.</p>
<p>If you believe that education can still save the country, what should be done about these out-of-school children who have no money? They are eagerly hoping that you can lead them into the school gate.</p>

<p>Introduction of Military Food: Now that national disasters are imminent, soldiers are lying in trenches, day and night, in damp and cold conditions, resulting in pale faces, emaciation, beriberi, and swelling. The main reason is that the stomach is full of irregularities, causing gastrointestinal diseases, which gradually become epidemics and plagues. This is lamentable. The remedy is to take a cheap and good product called Rice Essence, Milgen, a well-made domestic food. It contains a large amount of vitamins, which can replenish vital energy, strengthen the spleen and stomach, eliminate dampness and stagnation, and have remarkable effects on various intestinal and stomach diseases, as well as beriberi and edema. If soldiers can take one spoonful a day, their stomach strength will greatly increase.</p>
