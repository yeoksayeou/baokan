<h3 id="c1">日本之左傾運動　彬 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>一昨所論日本之右傾運動。爲日本之黑暗面。今請更一檢閱其光明之左傾運動。</p>
<p>由於經濟之凋敝。生活之艱難。邇年來日本一般下層羣衆之思想。已日趨於左傾。東北禍變爆發。上海戰事接踵發生而後。一方面增加鉅大之軍費。一方面對華貿易幾於全部停頓。故其國内之不景氣乃愈益加深。下層羣衆之生活乃愈益惡化。據三月四日日本官方統計失業人數已達四十七萬七百三十六人。以人口計算。約當千分之六又六人。實則此種數目字。猶爲官方掩飾之統計。失業人數實已超過二百餘萬。人就此吾人應已可以想見下層羣衆生活日趨於艱難之一斑。至於農村。則絲業凋敝。農産價格狂落。農民所負債務與欠付地主之地租。都感無力担負。益以年歲荒歉。民苦飢饉。農村經濟更日瀕於破産之狀態。而在另一方面。則資本家之貪婪。政客之卑鄙。軍閥之暴戾專恣。窮續兵武。殘民以逞。政治之法西斯蒂化適足以愈益激起下層羣衆階級之仇恨。左傾運動乃亦洶湧澎湃。激而爲時代怒潮。</p>
<p>吾人試一檢閱最近報紙上所批露之消息。二月間以反帝國主義戰爭打倒資本主義爲口號之勞農大衆黨。在日比谷公園舉行反對出兵侵華演說大會。到聽衆千餘人。見警察干涉演說并逮捕黨員二宅正一。憤恨異常。蜂湧至警署。奪還二宅。二月十四日東京早稻田大學郵局發現激烈文字之信數百封。分寄東京市内外之勞働者。促勞働者起而反抗政府。署名爲日本共産黨中央執委會。三月間佐世保軍港發生煽動海軍情事。煽亂者皆爲十八九以至廿六七之靑年。銀行各公署以及各機關。無産靑年同盟會以及日本共産黨同盟等亦極爲活動。三月間曾逮捕日本銀行調查局女事務員松本善子等三十餘人。但終無法撲滅三月十七日東京反帝國主義同盟秘密集會。謀有所舉動被警偵悉。逮捕多人。中多爲帝大學生及中央大學學生。神户共黨全協無産靑年黨秘密大聯合。實行共黨第四次再建運動。三月十二日被警債悉。逮捕八十餘人。多爲專門學校中學校學生。搜出手槍子彈日本刀七首等。堆如山積。即如女子思想亦日益左傾。東京女子大學學生。以謀再建左翼運動。最近被逮捕杉田敬子等多名。東京市療養所看護婦以參加左傾運動。去年曾被逮捕四十餘人。但目前仍與全市各看護婦會聯絡。積極活動。頗有擴大趨勢。凡茲所舉。固極瑣碎。然就此而觀。吾人亦已可以推知日本之左傾運動。已如火燎原。吾人蓋可斷言毁滅舊日本。建立新日本之偉大行動。終將在此局部的零碎的革命鬭爭總匯合之下。䇄然獻呈於吾人之眼前。</p>
<p>由於經濟情勢之轉捩。思想之分化。自必然的日益尖銳化。舊勢力爲掙扎其最後一息之殘喘。旣竭其力以企圖遏止時代之洪流。而呈現迴光返照之現象。新勢力亦竭力以爭取光明之前路。推進時代。步入一嶄新之階段。日本今日即處於此左傾右傾兩道洪流衝激之下。而動邊而没落。寖且由蛻變而</p>
<p>新生。</p>
<p>豈僅日本。資本主義經濟體系下之國家。又何莫不皆然。世界之蛻變爲期應已不遠。吾人但當瞻望曙光。竭全力以共趨。</p>

<p>卽如何解釋「平時狀態」</p>
<p>下次開會將提决議案</p>
<p>路透社十七日日内瓦電云、國聯大會主席希孟、昨晚商諸中國總代表顔惠慶博士、及日本代表團之長岡、今日復與繼續晤談、俟與雙方商妥後、將定下次十九國特委會開會日期、中日代表顯必請示於本國政府、而後始能贊同所將提交特委會之議案内容、日内瓦日報、深以昨日特委會開會不公開爲憾、謂此足表示該會之張皇失措、而又將蹈辦理滿案之覆轍、路透社十七日倫敦電云、據日内瓦消息、國聯日代表團之長岡、已告知國聯大會主席希孟、謂日政府允在上海舉派混合委員團監理日軍由目下之陣地退入公共租界事宜、希孟現謀向顔惠慶博士得同様之允諾、</p>
<p>國民社十六日日内瓦電云、今日、十九國委員會開會、討論上海日軍撤退事件時、爭論頗烈、其中各小國均熱烈贊助中國之主張、應將撤兵時期加以限定、惟辯駁三小時之久、尙無具體之結果、但據可靠方面之預測、將來恐將組織一中立委員會、以便隨時决定上海事態狀况、以定日軍逐漸撤退之步驟、再則又傳十九國委員會會長希孟對於此種計劃、已有所籌備、約於下星期會議重開時、即可提出討論、現正在與中日代表雙方磋商之中、而其中最重要之一點、即爲「平時狀態」之解釋、因日本撤退軍隊、必須視當地情形已經恢復原狀始可云、下次開會、復將有議决案提出、督促中日雙方依據該項原則、繼續和平會議、再則日本代表團之無禮聲明、謂日本代表將不列於委員會會議、遇有必要時、僅能派遣一下級人員作一報告云云、各國代表聞之、頗爲憤怒國民社十六日日内瓦電云、國聯大會十九國委員會今日决定請中日雙方考慮一折衷辦法、對於日兵退出中國管轄境内不規定日期、但鄭重說明「平常狀態」之開始、爲决定撤兵之重要份子、至所稱「平常狀態」、究於何時可謂回復、應由混合委員團决定、主席希孟並鄭重聲明、「平常狀態、」並非作爲中國人民停止抵制日貨解釋、此外又商定該委員團、一俟地方情形可以撤退日軍時、應即報告國聯、此外又應將上海情形、隨時報告國聯、倘此種辦法、能爲中日雙方所接受、則可重製成决議案、可望十九國委員會於星期一公開表决、今夜希孟已將此提議、向中日代表接洽、聞中代表態度猶踌躇不定、欲决議案内有更形切實之規定、但對於未列入政治條件一層、尙覺差强人意、</p>

<p>各館工友激憤異常　自工潮發生後、因調解棘手、迄今尙未解决、工會始終不願事態擴大、致使全國聽聞中斷、故抱定委曲求全、聽候調解、傳館方之悔悟、而申新時三報全體工人、以此次時事新報之工人、事前並無有任何條件、事後又並無要求提出、而館方竟此崛强、必欲置工人於死地、均激憤異常、羣起質問特委會之貽謨工人、雖經極力解釋、聽候調解、然此次之工潮、如不從速解决、恐難免有一重大之反響云、</p>
<p>報界工會最近表示、時事新報工潮發生、迄今尙未解决、館方最近向外界宣稱、謂該報工潮業已平定、昨日報界工會負資發言人鄭重表示、該報工潮發生、乃館方有計畫破壞工人組織而起、事實眞相與調解經過、社會人士、多已明瞭、工會方面、以工人存亡所繫、决不與之妥恊、草草了結、至館方宣稱工潮平定、全爲掩耳盜鈴之手段云、又據該發言人云、最近所謂救國除奸團署名傳單、謂該報係日人背景與資本云云、本會昨日亦接到一份、惟閱十五日龍報披露「時事新報工潮之一函」一則、推測謂工方所爲、但本會會員、深知勞資合作、方能生存、此次工潮之起、工友始終堅持恢復四月二日以前狀態而上工、並無新提要求、期與館方合作、共圖該報發展、故該項破壞性之傳單、出之工方、毋乃太予盾云、</p>
<p>各方慰問源源不絶　近數日來、該報工潮、因各方極力奔走調解、故一時消息沉悶、而滬上各工會表示憤慨者、風起雲湧、並聞郵務兩工會捐欵慰問被迫工友、茲將各方慰問消息、披錄如下、</p>
<p>郵職二會捐資慰問　敝會此次自告奮勇、擔任調解、但信望未孚、功敗垂成、殊覺慚愧之至、接洽經過、報端已詳、諒已洞悉、恕不多述、茲特派朱學範黃公復兩代表前來慰問、并奉上援欵洋五十元、乞祈哂納、區區之數、焉敢言助、略表同情耳、尙望繼續奮鬥、最後之成功、必屬貴會、</p>
<p>上海海員工會郵電、近聞時事新報館方、强制工友代印其他報紙、企圖片面利益、忽視工友苦痛、無　　迫、　意摧殘、本會同在工導立塲、對於此次糾紛、甚爲諸君表示同情、茲特馳電派員慰問、　部作有力之援助、中華海員工衆聯合總會上海分會整理委員會叩文、</p>

<p>附錄國聯處置中日糾紛經過</p>
<p>我國限期退兵的一貫主張、雖因各方反對而放棄、然對於未來的决議草案、仍主張規定、（一）調查團應有監督退兵之權、（二）該團達到目的地時、應將日本曾否根據决議案實行退兵的情形、報告行政院、而日本則主張、（一）調查團無干涉兩方軍事之權、（二）調查團應到中國内地調查抵制日貨情形、（三）該團達到目的地點時、不能爲證明日兵未曾撤退的報告、以避免間接限期退兵的規定、（四）日本在東省有剿匪之權、</p>
<p>日本主張四點之中、以第四點爲最野蠻無理、因剿匪之權、乃獨立國家之主權也、况以剿匪爲名、以進兵爲實、是日本的慣技、今日本竟要求行政院授以在東省剿匪權、即麻木不仁之行政院、亦因此而生反感、於是嚴辭拒絶了、至於其餘各點、修改文字之後、經兩方贊同者仍保留之、不能相容之數點、則用折衷辦法、由主席另發宣言聲明之、讀者至决議案及主席宣言撮要時、便能明白了、</p>

<p>英國代表聲明、日本之自動剿匪、雖爲不可免的事實但一俟恢復原狀之後、此種特殊行動、應即停止、</p>
<p>其餘各國代表均有發言、大意略說、中日糾紛發生之後、已有數月、現在的决議案、本非澈底的辦法、然以滿洲問題性質特别、所以其解决辦法、應不能爲將來的先例、南美洲弱小國家代表、更有沈痛演說、我國施代表亦以各國代表之明知自已懦弱無勇、不敢抗拒暴日、又恐對於將來之國際糾紛、有人根據此種先例、「請公入甕」、因此特别聲明此次中日糾紛的特别性質、憤然以嚴峻的態度說、中國政府絶對不承認國際公法的効力、祗能及於滿洲的邊界、二十餘天之會議、至此遂告一暫時的結束、</p>
<p>（四）决議案及主席宣言研究、該决議案内容、分爲六項、（一）行政院茲再聲明九月三十日全體</p>
<p>一致通過的决議案、中日兩方、有遵守的義務、因此請中日兩國政府、切實履行、務使日本軍隊於該决議案所規定條件之下、於最短時期、退回南滿路線之内、（二）自從十月二十四日行政院閉會後、所發生之情形、更加嚴重、兩方今已承認設法避免擴大、自行檢束、以免從新發生戰事傷殘人命、（三）請兩方繼續隨時以最近情形、報告於行政院、（四）請其餘各國政府、將其在滿洲代表寄來之消息、隨時報告行政院、（五）爲協助中日兩國解决一切懸案起見、行政院决定遣派五人組調查團、親往滿洲研究一切有危害國際邦交·中日間的和平·或爲該兩國間和平所寄托的和睦的環境、報告行政院、并請中日政府各派一員以參加該團的工作、及供給該團以一切之材料、并且聲明如中日兩國作直接交涉時、該團不得干涉、又關於軍事問題、亦無干涉之權、日本政府因牠有執行九月三十日决議的義務、不得因該團的組織及工作之拖延、而緩期撤兵、（六）行政院下届會議、定於一九三二年一月二十五日舉行、遇必要時、主席得隨時召集緊急會議、　（未完）</p>

<p>最近張惠長氏晋京。據說與編組空軍問題有關。他擬了「空軍三年計劃」。劃北平·南京·廣州三個航空區。預計每區第一年編練戰鬥機一百架。第二年三百架。第三年五百架。每區並設廠自造發動機。這偉大的計劃。希望合全國人之力。促其實現。而粤省所施行每縣捐機三架。小縣一架。尤望政府通令全國。尅期實行。下最大决心。必獲最大的成功。</p>

<p>骷髏團。來自北地。誓掃胡虜。不欲生還。團員共八十餘人。抵正儀投十九軍區壽年師長麾下。懇赴前綫工作。區師長感其赤忱。允之。團員中有七女子。俱屬靑年。姿容美妙。而服飾又極時尙。實所謂摩登人物也。區師長憐彼輩弱質零丁。囑在後方服務。藉减辛苦。七女子曰。師長美意。甚感。惟不欲拜受。吾輩雖女子。實不願屈居男子後。並自信能力。亦不在男子之下。師長此舉。乃歧視男女。吾輩决與男團員同赴前方。决與男團員同一辛勞。苟他日吾儕成績不若男子。則師長賜調後方。或竟以工作不力而懲處。而處死。亦所心甘。斯際則誓不拜命也。區師長聞言。大爲感動。立允其請焉。全團旣至前綫。從事建築防禦工程。七女子肼手胝足。無間風雨。其體力。其勤奮。俱不亞於男子。其工作成績。亦不惟不及。或且過之。諸女士日夕寢處沙塲。此身已早許國。故無暇整理其服飾。亦不願留其美容。迄乎今日。莫不科頭跣足。易旗袍爲戰袍矣。事爲昨日服務前綫之某君歸滬言之。詢以諸女士芳名。則曰未知。致不獲一一表出。實憾事也。</p>

<p>暴日侵凌。慘無人道。閘北吳淞。一片丘墟。明星影片公司曾有戰區實地影片之攝製。舉凡日軍慘酷之遺跡。我人遭受之痛苦。靡不一一搜羅。巨細無遺。當攝取時。日軍飛機。追踪擲彈。卒能不避艱險。成此巨片。其名貴可知。國府當局。曾定製一部。寄贈國聯。藉將暴日蠻橫之事跡。宣揚於世界。狡滑如日人。恐亦不能再事掩飾矣。</p>
<p>月初。國聯調查專員晋京。張石川君偕同技師多人。兼程如寗。就勵志社招待席上。攝得有聲電影不少。歸途經吳門。下榻金閶門外。承翁旅長之介。特赴太倉崑山靑暘港等處攝取我十九路軍之軍隊生活。凡軍長蔡廷楷以次。均有留影。此行</p>
<p>共勾留兩星期。日日皆在最前線工作。頃已全體返滬。以飽受風霜之故。面目黧黑。鬚髮種種。據云方攝製時。敵偵察機時來陣地。盤旋不去。我十九路軍枕戈待旦。精神煥發。於防禦工程。絶不稍懈。堪以告慰於國人云云。聞所攝聲片已在印製中。關心前線者不久又得與我忠勇之十九路軍相見矣。</p>

<p>一九一四年。世界大戰發生。英軍專藉坦克車的取勝。但當時不過爲一五瓲至二十瓲的重車與五瓲至十瓲的輕車。以及補助用的三瓲豆戰車。技術發達。所有四十瓲以上八十瓲以下的大型戰車出現。裝甲自一五耗至三十耗。速度由三十粁至五十粁。内置機關槍與輕重各砲。一九六年英軍聖姆之役。又賴坦克車的威力。迭次衝破德陣。於是又呈劃期的進步。到了現在。又改爲六輪式。裝軌式。最大速度。已達八十粁。内可裝機關槍四架。聽說今日德國的軍隊中。一營的兵。有坦克車三十輛。前月美國又新發明水陸兩用輕便的坦克車。構造裝備。尤爲精巧。因爲從前所用的坦克車。祗可在陸上行走。而且碰到地質鬆軟潮濕的泥沙中。就要陷没。水陸兩地車。即可避免種種弊端了。</p>
<p>日本的坦克車。是在世界大戰後所仿造的。就是模仿英國政府怕贈的女性坦克車爲標準。近年來出品漸多。這回開到上海戰爭的。係該國唯一獨立的久留米戰車隊。都是八九式的日本貨。内裝以八九式的戰鬥機。但其武裝速力破壞力等。到也很厲害。在閘北江灣作戰時。對於偵察戰鬥重爆聲。頗爲活動。可是爲我軍地雷擊燬的也不少。這一點。就是他們日本報紙。也承認不諱的。</p>

<p>— 墨逸</p>
<p>一幕悲壯光榮的大戰，便在老趙們的隊伍開到江灣後的第三天的嶢霧迷漫的淸晨開始了。</p>
<p>「老張，咱們來了兩天了，怎麽矮鬼不來啊？他們爲什麽只打閘北？可惡極了。他們也不換換新的味兒，難道瞧不起咱們麽？唉，要他們來，他們偏不來，大槪是咱老趙的名氣驚了他們了？哈哈，矮鬼，矮鬼，來啊，他媽的，幹麽不來啊！」老趙抽着烟捲兒，恨恨的說。</p>
<p>「老趙，别嘰咕了，你瞧，不是來了麽？」老張拉了一拉老趙的衣服，呌他看那遠遠的一·排像是一様的東西在灰暗的光綫下往他們這兒爬過來。</p>
<p>「那是什麽東西啊？老張，像王八一様的東西。」老趙說着隨手拿了烟捲兒，便把槍械給預備好了，邊這様問着老張。</p>
<p>「唐克車」。老張也把槍描準着敵人。</p>
<p>「眞新鮮！····啊，近了！·····近了！」</p>
<p>當長官下令開槍的時候，敵人的子彈已經像雨點一様的飛過來了。敵人越逼越近了。我們的勇士没有等到長官的衝鋒令，便已一齊躍出戰壕向敵人衝去。這些熱血奔流的勇士，他們是怎様的使敵人驚惶啊··他們的刺刀，他們的子彈，他們的勇氣，他們的戰術，他們的行動，每一種戰事的表演，都能予敵人以威脅，知道我們的勇士是這様不可侮的。不由敵人不後退了。不由敵人不去找一個安全地以保護自已的生命了。</p>
<p>「哈，敵人把背交給們了！眞痛快，老張，咱今天眞殺得痛快極了！殺！殺！·····殺啊！」</p>
<p>在一陣密密的槍聲和雄壯的喊聲以後，敵人紛紛倒地的又是幾十個。他們殺退了敵人以後，奉了長官的命令，仍退回戰壕防守。這時天已大亮了。陽仍是照例放出他的光輝，好像大地上的這番殘酷的舉動和他無關係的。</p>
<p>「老張你没有哄咱，矮鬼的確比土匪還要好打！咱打了八年的仗，從來没有今天這様打得痛快！····」</p>
<p>老趙一個人嚷了半天，並没有一個人理他，便賭氣　在戰壕裏，看看天上的浮雲在出神。他嘴裏吐出的白烟，在他眼前躍動，幻成下次比這次更要殺得痛快的象徴；他嘴邊持着的微笑，便可以表示他已經得了更好的，而且更能殺得痛快的戰術了。</p>

<p>自週一（四月十一日）大條銀仍縮一二五、美銀縮一二五、先令勿更、美金反長一二五、因匯兌報大故也、内盤亦然、業中扒結近期、至金價五月份初開七百零八兩半、即加五兩三錢、次爲零九兩、以後賣多、當退爲零二兩、後有二三兩上落、午收零三兩九錢、下午零四兩、開盤旋後大户脫手、從爲零一兩八錢、中央開去現金四五百條、價乃上漲爲零五兩二錢、迨收市退爲零二兩九錢、比上週六計小去三錢、全日有七兩二錢回旋、大連帮售出頭寸、廣帮及現貨號家則進、以抵賣出之現貨、</p>

<p>（週三）英銀回縮一二五、美銀縮二五、滬市英平美堅、繼因掛牌改縮一檔、先令二五、美金三七五、故内盤均亦見緊、各號奮扒不已、惟花旗銀公司售出也、殆標金初開即加三兩三錢、爲七百十二兩、次由十三兩半至十一兩半、嗣後匯市旣緊、逐步上升、達十九兩一錢、午收十八兩六錢、下午開盤十八兩八錢、買方逞勇、穿出二十兩、繼由二十三兩收市、比上日續漲十四兩三錢、全日有十一兩半迴顧、因掉期逼近、空方急補、</p>
<p>（週四）大條縮一八七五、美銀縮二五、而滙市掛牌勿更、内盤英鬆美堅、此乃匯兌軋小也、殆金市七百二十三兩開市、然大條微縮欠多、幸脚地尙好、方能站住也、以後大户興奮爭購、乃美金益挺、曾見二十七兩高峯、然吳某及各號趁此脫手、復趨銳落、午收二十一兩九錢、下午二十一兩半、旋後謠言四起、當跌至十九兩半、後以印匯報小、遂見高翔、迨收市二十三兩二錢、比上日僅加二錢、全日有七兩半差次、</p>
<p>（週五）英美銀市各縮一二五、先令反長一二五、美金亦加一二五、乃匯兌略小、不以爲動、且以脚地報告、美國有維持銀價之說、故内盤亦鬆、殆金市初開降三兩二錢、爲七百二十兩、後以路透社德國買進大批現銀、以鑄銀幣、約計一萬萬馬克、故人心下游、當瀉却四兩餘、爲十五兩八錢、後加至二十兩半、午收十九兩半、下午十八兩八錢、收市十八兩、比上日回落五兩二錢、終日有五兩四錢、上下形勢尙平、</p>

<h3 id="c126">不到閘北去 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— 金</p>
<p>大美晚報云，「閘北地方日軍控制下之華人政治機關，自四月一日出現後，四月十一日，曾爲日海軍當道命令所解散，但今（十六）日又重行出現，第其主腦人物，則已非舊人」，</p>
<p>我見了這段新聞，便倒抽了一口冷氣，舊漢奸雖已解散，新傀儡又去登塲，我認爲倒去顚來，總是這一套把戲，本要想提起筆來痛痛快快大駡他們一頓，後來想想，可以不必，因爲這種漢奸，非常之多，本屬駡不勝駡，並且旣是漢奸，自有國家法律去制裁，自有人類公理去討伐，這種没腦筋没心肝的東西，所謂三分像人七分像獸，患不着汚辱我的筆墨去痛駡他們，</p>
<p>在現在狀態之下，我的主張就是「不到閘北去」五個大字的新標語，因爲一般良民，不到閘北則已，一到閘北，必定要受漢奸的指揮，漢奸的約朿，漢奸的勒索和威迫，試問我們良民，值得不值得去受一般狐羣狗黨來維持我們保障我們麽？所以我說不到閘北去的意思，就是勸諸君</p>
<p>欲居住者不居住閘北　　欲營業者不營業閘北　　欲旅行者不旅行閘北</p>
<p>總之在日兵未曾完全撤退以前，决不要到閘北去，不要去看日人猙獰的形狀，不要看一般漢奸的作倀，衣食住行，原是人生的四大要素，本來「安土重遷」的民族性，住慣在閘北的人民，一時原不肯輕易喬遷的，好在此次兵燹之餘，住屋財物大抵爲砲火所破壞，居民之遷徙者，亦已十之七八，現在成爲鬼哭神號豺狼窟穴的區域，倘然前去，未免觸景生情，不寒而慄，</p>
<p>還有一層，本來住居閘北的人民，大抵寄人廡下者居多，而自置房産者絶少，同一寄人廡下，何必定要卜居閘北呢？這種辦法，我認爲十分妥當，他們維持會的意義，第一無非維持敵人，第二維持他們自己，若說維持地方二字，恐怕萬萬做不到罷，惟有不到閘北去，却是一個萬妥萬當的辦法，</p>

<p>— 乃微</p>
<p>黃昏的時候，在閙熱的南京路上，我們可以看見，兩旁的橱窗裏，有紅紅綠綠，鮮艷美麗的光線發出來，有圖形的商標，有店號的名字，非常的昡目，這種廣告燈眞能引人注意。</p>
<p>此燈英文名呌「Ｎeon-Sign　Ligbt」，我們可以釋做「氖燈」，她是從「水銀弧光燈」（Ｍercury　Arc　Lamp)改變而成的，所以有許多人呌她「水銀燈」·她祗有很短的歷史，是好像一個小寳寳出世</p>
<p>後還没有滿季哩，但她鮮艷得可愛，所以商店裏的老板儘願多費一些錢請她終日住在玻璃櫉窗内，誘引一班買客。</p>
<p>水銀弧光燈，又呌庫悲希脫燈（ＣooPer-ＨeWltt　Lamp)，因爲是他發明的。這種燈的製法是先拿玻璃管放在不發烟的火中烘軟，慢慢的彎成各種圖案或文字，裝置在黑色的底板上，底板可以用鉛皮或薄木板製成；玻璃管的長短大約二英尺到四英尺，普通用的粗細，直徑祗有七粍至十三粍（Ｍillimeter)，彎好的兩管口放在底板後面；乃把一頭的口用金屬物做的電極封好，以抽空氣機抽得管中完全空，使這管變成眞空管（Ｖacuum　Tube)·以水銀蒸氣（Ｍercury　Vapor），放入管中，未封的管口也可以用金屬的電極封牢·電接在管口的兩電極上，電流會從水銀蒸氣中通過，便發出美麗的光；光的顔色是綠，藍，黃三種，但無論如何紅光終不能發出來·倘使用了水晶（Ｑuartz）做成的管子來代玻璃管，她能夠變成一種紫外光線（Ｕltra-violet　rays），這光線太陽光中有的，她能夠使我們健康，並且能消毒殺菌，近來市上可以租或買的，醫院中用的人造太陽燈，就是這種，不過形式上兩様一些。</p>
<p>後來英國威廉士拉姆珊爵士、（ＳirWilliam　Ramsay）從空氣中分析出氖來，於是取稀薄氖放一些進去代水銀氣，電流通過後，就有紅色的光發出來，這紅光是她本身發出來的，並不是像普通紅玻璃電燈泡發出來的紅光，她有特殊的能力，可以通過烟霧，所以飛機上的燈，火車船艦上用的信號燈，海洋中燈塔的燈，用她有很靠得住的效力。倘使在氖燈管裏再混一些水銀蒸氣進去，便放出紫靑的光線來。用了一種淡的豆沙色玻璃管，便成美麗的綠色的光；在日間，我們可以看店家櫉窗裏有淡豆沙色的空玻璃管，到晚間大槪是發綠色的光出來的。講到氖是一種很難得的東西，占空氣中十萬分之一的體積·即十萬竔（Ｌiter)中祗能分析出一竔來；所以牠的價値很貴，一竔要買到一百多塊錢。幸運得很，氖燈中不用許多，祗要稀薄的一些·</p>
<p>通過燈管中的電要有極大的電壓，並且燈管長，電壓要大·即通電的電壓與燈管的長度成正比。因爲兩個電極的距離有從二英尺到四英尺的遠，所以用普通二百二十弗打（Ｖolt）的電壓是不會使她發光的，至少要用到四千五百弗打以上的電壓。我們平常用的電上要接廣告燈，當中一定要接一只變壓機，使電壓變高·她須要的電流是很小的，比我們平常用的電燈省得多。</p>
<p>還有一種用氖（Ｈelium）封入管内的，可以稱做氦燈，能夠放出美麗的金光·在紐約的街市上可以看見，但是在上海都是紅紅綠綠的。因爲氦比氖更少，世界上祗有二國能製出來，所以價錢比氖貴得多，並且美國是禁止牠出口的。</p>
<p>以上三種廣告燈的缺點是要用高壓電力，所以一只小的廣告燈，也用一只變壓器，價錢比大的稍爲低一些，在玻璃管與氖原料上·</p>
<p>我們老大哥抽抽空氣，彎彎玻璃管是會的，上海有年紅燈公司等能製各種氖廣告燈，非常精巧，惜原料都購自他國。</p>
<p>隨便談談</p>

<p>— 洪水</p>
<p>某個夜上，我爲了四周的空氣感覺得異常沉悶；——好，『逛馬路去』腦海裏是這様地說：雖然時光已經九點鐘光景，但是我的理想終是實現了。</p>
<p>踏進浙江路轉個灣，就到四馬路：心窠裏懷抱着可以散散悶充分的希望，張開眼睛看：什麽吃的，着的，玩的，一切的一切，都是陳列得熱熱閙閙：眞可說是一條完備的馬路。</p>
<p>在這馬路一角，圍着一羣人們，一個個的臉兒，都露出一種恐怖的様子；爲好奇心驅動的我，仔細的走上看了一個究竟。</p>
<p>那裏是立着二位外國巡捕同一位華捕，一律穿着一件黑馬夾，腰裏各掛一枝手槍，他們正在拉住一個彷彿商人様子的我國同胞，——被抄的商人，如像老鷹抓着雛雞似的任意摸佈；頓時失了神態，不住的全身在顫抖着！洋捕看着這副神色，板起鋼鐵般的面孔，嘴巴裏吵了一口嘰哩咕嚕的洋話，是像命令華捕說：</p>
<p>『仔細；當心，不準放過門』。</p>
<p>華捕更露出一種服從命令忠於職責的臉色，運動起他的粗而且長的兩手，把那商人渾身上下的摸索不休！</p>
<p>······商人受不住這般壓迫，忍痛的說：</p>
<p>『巡捕老爺！對不住，阿拉身上祗有五塊洋鈿，××路××里的同鄕借來的，儂弗要抄，違禁物，阿拉生意人是勿敢藏，見了儂的抄八字實在怕，多多謝謝放了吧！</p>
<p>話未說完，混蛋！不許動！華捕怒聲厲色的對着商人，一面在腰包裏取出一枝手槍亮光光的向商人臉上搖上兩搖，要動嗎？同時那兩個發號施令外國巡捕，不約而同這個賜他一只耳光，那個也賜他一只外國火腿；還操一口上海白：</p>
<p>『王八蛋！儂倒邪氣，有反動嫌疑！弗要逃·····』</p>
<p>於是華捕顯着勝利模様，一把拖着索落落顫抖着那個商人的頸皮到××局，去，去，去。</p>

<p>自從十九路軍因後援不濟，退出吳淞閘北江灣之後，就有所謂停戰會議。停戰會議開了一個月，究竟在那裏談論些什麽，局外人當然不甚了了。這幾天，聽說因爲日本人堅持無理要求，形勢險惡，停戰會議有决裂之慮。自從這個消息在各報上宣佈之後，我天天在盼望着牠决裂，這眞是一個反常的念頭，人家在那裏忍辱退讓的希望停戰會議成功，我却在這裏希望决牠裂。</p>
<p>不管牠反常不反常，賣報的張三却因爲這個消息，賺了我不少銅版。本來從十九路軍退出後，他的販賣名報號外生涯，一落萬丈，任他如何賣力的在門外呌喊，我總不睬他。但這幾天他一喊；「號外來哉···剛剛出版！」心裏就砰然有動，滿心希望着决裂，决裂！但買來一見，今天小組會議，明天小組會議，和平旣然遙遙無期，决裂也就可望而不可及！不禁要駡一聲該死的張三，又騙了我了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japan's Left-Leaning Movement - Bin <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In the previous discussion, we addressed Japan's right-leaning movement, which represents the dark side of Japan. Now, let's take a closer look at its bright side: the left-leaning movement.</p>
<p>Due to economic decline and difficult living conditions, in recent years, the ideology of the general lower-class masses in Japan has increasingly shifted towards the left. After the outbreak of the Northeast Incident and the subsequent Shanghai War, on one hand, there was a massive increase in military expenditure, and on the other hand, trade with China almost completely ceased. Consequently, the domestic recession deepened, and the lives of the lower classes deteriorated further. According to official Japanese statistics on March 4th, the number of unemployed people had reached 470,736. Calculated by population, this is approximately 6.6 per thousand. In reality, this figure is still an understatement by the official statistics. The actual number of unemployed people has exceeded two million. From this, we can already imagine how difficult life has become for the lower classes. As for the rural areas, the silk industry is in decline, agricultural prices are plummeting, and farmers are unable to bear the debts and land rent owed to landlords. In addition, years of poor harvests have led to famine, and the rural economy is on the verge of collapse. On the other hand, the greed of capitalists, the baseness of politicians, and the brutality and tyranny of warlords, continuously expand military power and use it to oppress the people. The fascistization of politics only serves to further incite the hatred of the lower classes. The left-leaning movement is also surging and turning into a tide of anger of the times.</p>
<p>Let us examine the recent news reports. In February, the Labor-Farmer Masses Party, under the slogan of opposing imperialist war and overthrowing capitalism, held a rally in Hibiya Park to oppose sending troops to invade China. Over a thousand people attended. They were extremely angry when they saw the police interfering with the speeches and arresting party member Masaichi Nitaku. They swarmed to the police station and rescued Nitaku. On February 14th, hundreds of letters with radical content were discovered in the post office of Waseda University in Tokyo, addressed to workers in and outside Tokyo, urging them to rise up and resist the government. The letters were signed by the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Communist Party. In March, there were incidents of inciting the navy in Sasebo Naval Port. The instigators were all young people aged eighteen or nineteen to twenty-six or twenty-seven. The Proletarian Youth League and the Japanese Communist Party League were also very active in banks, government offices, and various institutions. In March, over thirty people, including Yoshiko Matsumoto, a female clerk from the Research Department of the Bank of Japan, were arrested. However, it was ultimately impossible to extinguish the secret meeting of the Anti-Imperialist League in Tokyo on March 17th. They were planning actions but were discovered by the police and many were arrested. Many of them were students from Imperial University and Central University. The Kobe Communist Party’s All-Association Proletarian Youth Party secretly united to carry out the Fourth Reconstruction Movement of the Communist Party. On March 12th, they were discovered by the police and over eighty people were arrested. Many of them were students from vocational schools and middle schools. Guns, bullets, and seven Japanese swords were seized, piled up like a mountain. Even female thought is increasingly leaning to the left. Students at Tokyo Women's University were recently arrested, including Keiko Sugita and others, for plotting to rebuild the left-wing movement. Nurses at the Tokyo Municipal Sanatorium were arrested last year for participating in the left-leaning movement. However, they are still actively communicating with nurses' associations throughout the city and are showing a trend of expansion. All of the above are extremely trivial. However, from this, we can also infer that Japan's left-leaning movement is like a fire spreading across the plains. We can assert that the great action of destroying the old Japan and establishing a new Japan will eventually, through the convergence of these local and fragmented revolutionary struggles, be clearly presented before our eyes.</p>
<p>Due to the turning point in the economic situation and the differentiation of thought, it will inevitably become increasingly acute. The old forces, in their struggle for their last gasp of breath, are exhausting their efforts to try to contain the torrent of the times, presenting a phenomenon of a last burst of glory. The new forces are also striving to win a bright future, advancing the times and entering a new stage. Japan today is under the impact of these two torrents of left-leaning and right-leaning, moving towards decline and, eventually, transforming and being reborn.</p>
<p>And not only Japan. Every country under the capitalist economic system is the same. The transformation of the world should not be far off. We should only look forward to the dawn and devote our full strength to move towards it together.</p>

<p>Namely, how to interpret "State of Peace"</p>
<p>A Resolution Will Be Proposed at the Next Meeting</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 17th - League of Nations Assembly President Hymans conferred with Chinese Chief Delegate Dr. Yen Hui-ching last night, and with Nagaoka of the Japanese delegation. He will continue to meet with them today. After reaching an agreement with both parties, the date for the next meeting of the Committee of Nineteen will be set. The Chinese and Japanese representatives will obviously need to consult with their respective governments before they can agree to the content of the resolution to be submitted to the committee. The Journal de Genève deeply regrets that yesterday's Committee meeting was not open to the public, saying that it indicates the committee's panic and that it will repeat the mistakes of handling the Manchurian case. Reuters, London, 17th - According to Geneva news, Nagaoka of the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations has informed League of Nations Assembly President Hymans that the Japanese government has agreed to have a mixed committee supervise the withdrawal of Japanese troops from their current positions into the Public Concession in Shanghai. Hymans is now seeking the same agreement from Dr. Yen Hui-ching.</p>
<p>Kokumin, Geneva, 16th - At today's meeting of the Committee of Nineteen, the discussion on the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai was quite heated. Among them, the smaller countries enthusiastically supported China's proposal to set a deadline for the troop withdrawal. However, after three hours of debate, there were no concrete results. However, according to reliable sources, it is predicted that a neutral committee will be organized in the future to determine the state of affairs in Shanghai at any time, in order to determine the steps for the gradual withdrawal of Japanese troops. Furthermore, it is rumored that Committee of Nineteen Chairman Hymans has already made preparations for this plan and may submit it for discussion when the meeting resumes next week. He is currently consulting with representatives from both China and Japan, and one of the most important points is the interpretation of "State of Peace," because Japan's withdrawal of troops must be based on the restoration of the local situation to its original state. At the next meeting, a resolution will be proposed to urge both China and Japan to continue peace talks based on this principle. Furthermore, the rude statement of the Japanese delegation, saying that the Japanese representatives will not be present at the committee meetings and can only send a lower-level staff member to make a report when necessary, was met with anger from the representatives of various countries. Kokumin, Geneva, 16th - The Committee of Nineteen of the League of Nations decided today to ask both China and Japan to consider a compromise solution, not to stipulate a date for the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Chinese-controlled territory, but to solemnly state that the beginning of the "normal state" is an important factor in determining the withdrawal of troops. As for when the so-called "normal state" can be said to have been restored, it should be determined by a mixed committee. Chairman Hymans also solemnly stated that "normal state" is not to be interpreted as the Chinese people ceasing their boycott of Japanese goods. In addition, it was agreed that the committee should report to the League of Nations as soon as the local situation allows for the withdrawal of Japanese troops, and that the committee should also report the situation in Shanghai to the League of Nations at any time. If this approach can be accepted by both China and Japan, it can be rewritten into a resolution and the Committee of Nineteen is expected to publicly vote on it on Monday. Tonight, Hymans has contacted the Chinese and Japanese representatives about this proposal. It is said that the Chinese representative is still hesitant and wants the resolution to have more concrete provisions, but is somewhat satisfied with the fact that political conditions are not included.</p>

<p>Long-Term Resistance Will Create a New National Life</p>
<p>Suzhou, 17th (Special Dispatch) - Zhao Yijian, staff officer of the 19th Route Army, gave an important interview to reporters on the 17th: (1) Regarding the Shanghai Peace Conference, this belongs to the central government's diplomatic administration, and our army is not in a position to comment. (2) Regarding the progress of the peace conference, reporting to the League of Nations to seek a solution, this is indeed as a certain American said, no matter how much China trusts the League of Nations, I am afraid that in fact, it will not be able to help in time. (3) Resisting Japan and saving the country has become a matter of course. As a soldier, I naturally advocate that we should send troops to recover lost territory immediately. This is not only my personal view, but also the view of all our officers and soldiers. (4) Seeking peace through humiliation may provide temporary stability, but it will bring endless disaster to the country and the nation. Long-term resistance will involve great sacrifices at present, which is expected. However, this can cause significant changes in the world and create a new life for the Chinese nation, which is also expected. (5) Warfare cannot rely entirely on military strength, but depends entirely on the spirit of sacrifice of the army and the people. When Chinese soldiers fight abroad and die in combat, they can shift the psychology of internal struggle and passively implement disarmament. (6) There are ways to deal with defeat in war, because China is an agricultural rather than an industrial country, and war will not affect the national economy. (7) In this time of national crisis, all important figures should be able to turn internal strife into resistance against foreign aggression.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Gunfire in Western Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Clash of Sentries at Dawn Yesterday</p>
<p>Japanese Side Increases Troops and Rushes to Build Fortifications</p>
<p>At dawn yesterday morning, multiple gunshots suddenly rang out, intermittently, in the area slightly west of Yujidun (i.e., Yejidun) in western Shanghai. The gunfire lasted for half an hour before stopping. After a detailed investigation by the New Voice News Agency reporter, the situation was as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e5">Sudden Appearance of Traitors <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>In the area of Xinjing in northwestern Shanghai, south of the Suzhou River, heavy troops have always been stationed. However, since the retreat of our army on March 1, only a very small number of troops have been left to guard the area, with very long sentry lines, reaching thirty to forty miles. This is not a hostile act, but merely to protect the area. The area also has a public security bureau water patrol team and police officers to maintain order, and the situation is still good. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, before dawn, when the sky was still hazy, two or three people resembling those from Jiangbei were suddenly discovered within our army's sentry line at Yejidun. Our army immediately discovered them and ordered them to stop. Later, our army saw that these people were behaving suspiciously, so they fired several shots into the air. The people fled upon hearing the shots.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Clash of Sentries <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>After our side fired shots, the Japanese troops north of the Suzhou River suddenly opened fire on our army upon hearing the sound. At that time, the frontline sentries of both sides engaged in gunfire, lasting for about half an hour before returning to silence. There were no casualties on either side, because it was only a small clash and not a formal war.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Japanese Side Increases Troops <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese troops in the area north of the Suzhou River in western Shanghai have been preparing for war. They have added barbed wire and sandbags in the area and are rushing to build fortifications. After the gunfire occurred yesterday morning, the Japanese side exaggerated the matter and immediately telegraphed the Japanese command to send more than 300 Japanese cavalry and more than 50 artillerymen to the Zhongshan Road area in western Shanghai, and dispatched nine armored vehicles, which patrolled back and forth all day. It was also reported that in recent days, Japanese troops have transferred heavy troops to various places in western Shanghai, such as Zhuangjiajing, Jiwangmiao, and Huacao, and are digging trenches and deploying defenses, creating a serious situation. Moreover, Japanese sentries often fired shots towards the south of the river to provoke challenges, so the villagers in various places were all panicked and fled for the second time. The shops and residents in Beixinjing Town were also very frightened, and the market was particularly deserted.</p>

<p>Kunshan, 17th (Special Dispatch) - (1) There are currently about 200 enemies at Luduqiao, and enemy scouts are appearing and disappearing at Hengliqiao. (2) Yesterday, dozens of enemies set out from Xintang Town to a place two miles east of Hongmiao, with people from Jiangbei as guides. Their arms were wrapped in white cloth, with the character "一" (one) written on them. They then turned back to Xintang Town. According to local people, the enemy's plainclothes detectives have two needles and a white thread wrapped around the needles, hidden under their clothes as a secret code. (3) The entire town of Xintang is surrounded by electric nets by the enemy, and trenches have been dug, keeping a close watch on the Taicang Avenue. Landmines have also been buried to the left and right of the school there. (4) Many landmines have also been buried by the enemy in the area near Liuhe. A reporter saw more than 40 enemy troops stationed in the Zhangjun Temple one day, with 15 or 16 of them crying, for some unknown reason.</p>
<p>Changshu, 17th (Special Dispatch) - Along the river at Qiyakou and Yanglinkou in Liuhe, the enemy has newly built fortifications, including covered trenches and long trenches. Slightly behind, there are many extremely solid small concrete artillery platforms. More than 1,000 enemies in Xintang Town were all withdrawn to Liuhe on the 17th. The enemies at Luduqiao and Hongmiao also retreated. The iron barracks in Qiya were dismantled. The enemy is building strong trenches two or three miles in front of Liuhe Town, connecting to Qiya and Yanglin. The enemy there seems to be taking a defensive position. On the 16th, many enemy troops from Liuhe went to Luodian. Enemy planes flew over again this morning and fired at Baimao, but no one was injured.</p>
<p>Suzhou, 17th - The enemy sentries and the enemy troops on the pontoon bridge in the area of Xintang Town and Hongmiao Paifang suddenly moved backward at 5:00 AM on the 17th. Some of the enemies in the Liuhe area retreated towards Luodian. Eighty or ninety cars were parked at the Liuhe bus station. Fifty or so enemy patrolmen came to the pontoon bridge again at noon on the 17th and went to Liuhe at 3:00 PM. It is reported that there are currently more than 200 enemies at Luduqiao, and enemy scouts appear and disappear at Huangliqiao.</p>

<p>Japanese Residents Exaggerate the Matter</p>
<p>Demanding that a Protest Be Lodged</p>
<p>The Far Eastern News Agency reports that at 2:00 PM yesterday, an American sailor went to a Japanese food store on Wusong Road to buy food. A dispute arose over change, and a quarrel broke out between the two parties. At that time, several Japanese soldiers were also in the store, which led to violence. Both parties were injured. An American soldier's eye was severely beaten. He was taken to the Hongkou Police Station and handed over to the American Command. It is reported that after the incident, more than 500 Japanese residents gathered at the Japanese Club to discuss countermeasures. They resolved to ask the Japanese consul to lodge a serious protest with the American consul and to lodge a protest with the Shanghai Municipal Council regarding the safety of Japanese residents.</p>

<p>According to shipping industry sources, recently, when ships on the Yangtze River leave the port, in addition to Japanese ships carrying large quantities of Japanese goods, other ships of major British shipping companies also transfer Japanese goods to Hankou and Chongqing. The customs declaration procedures are mostly handled by Japanese-owned customs brokers, and occasionally by one or two Chinese customs brokers. In short, Japanese goods have been very active recently.</p>

<p>Films Were Eventually Taken Away</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that last Friday, two Englishmen went to the Jiangwan Racecourse to visit. Both carried permits (although this item is no longer needed now) and a film camera to take pictures of the stables and the remains of a certain chicken farm, as the chicken farm was the property of one of them and was destroyed by artillery fire. One of them went there because he loved to see the peach blossoms and spring scenery. Suddenly, they were surrounded by a Japanese patrol, who accused the two of taking pictures of the Japanese military fortifications. In fact, the nearest fortifications were three miles west of Jiangwan Town. The two men argued strongly and declared that they were British citizens, but the Japanese ignored them and escorted them to the Japanese military headquarters in Jiangwan Town, about a mile away. The two men requested to meet with an officer, but only a civilian came and ordered them to hand over the camera for confiscation. The two men resolutely refused and continued to request to meet with an officer, but to no avail. At that time, a group of Japanese soldiers, both officers and enlisted men, surrounded the two men, and another group of Jiangbei coolies made fun of them. Later, the Japanese demanded that the films taken be destroyed before they could be released. Each film was worth 25 yuan, so the two men said that the films could be handed over, but a receipt had to be given. Unexpectedly, the so-called receipt only said "very sorry."</p>
<h3 id="e14">Research on the Legal Basis of Parallel Railway Line Records <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Diplomatic Personnel Discuss Diplomatic Customs</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that, according to news reports from Nanjing, the fact that there was no secret agreement on the parallel railway line, as claimed by the Japanese side in the 1905 treaty between China and Japan, has been confirmed. It was merely an unsigned record of meetings, so its legal basis is not valid. According to a diplomatic source, the meeting record is invalid not only because the negotiators of the two countries only signed the first letter of their names, but also because either party may declare it invalid. According to diplomatic custom, when two countries conclude a treaty, the representatives of both sides first sign the first letter of their names in capital letters on the proposed agreement. This is called signing a draft treaty. After that, the representatives of the two countries must consult their respective governments. After obtaining consent, the representatives formally sign the treaty. This formal signing must include the full English (or other language) name of the representative, and the representatives of both parties must also show each other the letters of authorization from their respective governments authorizing them as plenipotentiary representatives for the negotiations. The procedure is so solemn and strict. It can be seen that the meeting record cannot be effective simply by having the two representatives sign an English letter each. As for after signing a draft treaty, if one country believes that it cannot agree, it will be invalidated and a new one will be drafted. If a new one is not drafted, the negotiations will break down. Consider the Sino-Polish Treaty in 1930 and 1931. According to that treaty, a draft treaty was signed in 1930. In the spring of 1931, the Polish Minister to China still requested amendments. In the summer of that year, the Polish side sent a statement regarding the Free City of Danzig to our side. Therefore, the unsigned meeting record in the 1905 Sino-Japanese Treaty can be invalidated and ignored as usual.</p>

<p>To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Telegram, Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, esteemed Sirs: Japan is instigating a puppet state, refusing to allow Representative Gu Weijun to leave the customs, and openly making many threats. This is extremely hateful. Our country should immediately telegraph the League of Nations, proving that wherever Japanese soldiers arrive, unrest arises. Even the most esteemed members of the League of Nations Investigation Team cannot be guaranteed safety. It is clear that unless Japan immediately withdraws its troops, it will be impossible to restore order. In the past, our troops withdrew into the customs entirely out of respect for the League of Nations' intentions for peace. Now that the Investigation Team has no guarantee of safety in our Northeast Three Provinces territory, we should immediately select and dispatch heavy troops to escort them out of the customs, to fulfill our due responsibility. However, wherever the Investigation Team goes, the Japanese troops should immediately withdraw to avoid conflict. Otherwise, Japan must bear full responsibility. Furthermore, the Investigation Team should travel from Shanhaiguan. If they take the route through Dalian, they will be entirely manipulated by the Japanese and will not be able to travel to all the locations in western Liaoning, which is inconsistent with the original intention of the investigation. Please insist on this. We eagerly await your response. The National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China, respectfully.</p>
<p>To Gu Weijun Telegram, esteemed Mr. Gu Shaochuan: The violent Japanese are employing many cunning schemes, violating the resolutions of the League of Nations, and refusing to allow you to leave the customs, intending to confuse public opinion and conceal the truth. This is deeply hateful. The outcome of the investigation is related to the success or failure of diplomacy. It is your duty, so please bravely proceed and do not be misled by the enemy's empty words. Various organizations here have jointly telegraphed the government to expose Japan's conspiracy to the League of Nations. We also respectfully inform you. The National Crisis Relief Association of the Republic of China, respectfully.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Japanese Consul's Letter Requesting Protection for Japanese Residents <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The *Continental Daily* reports that the Japanese Consul-General Murai sent an official letter to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Peile, yesterday (the 16th), pointing out that cases of Japanese people being expelled in the Public Concession are increasing daily, and that the actions of the police have not been effective. He said that if this continues, it may cause major disputes. According to the Japanese Consul-General's letter, this was triggered by an incident where a Japanese resident, Iwayama, was allegedly attacked by Chinese people near the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Changsha Road on Friday morning. The letter stated: "Mr. Iwayama, a Japanese resident, aged 54, residing at 52 Miller Road, was walking near the intersection of Xin Zha Road and Changsha Road at approximately 10:00 AM yesterday when he was suddenly attacked and injured by Chinese rioters. He is currently in the Fumin Hospital, and it is difficult to determine whether his life is in danger. Recently, similar acts of violence against Japanese residents by Chinese people in the Public Concession have occurred repeatedly. I have repeatedly sent letters to the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Major General Macnaghten, requesting that the police be strictly vigilant to prevent such acts of violence from happening again, but it seems that there has been little effect. In view of the repeated occurrence of violent acts and the lack of effective response from the police, and also because the Japanese residents of this city are extremely angry about this, the Consul-General cannot help but feel deeply concerned that this may cause serious disputes. I am writing again to request that you instruct the police to take more strict and effective preventive measures to prevent similar acts of violence from happening again and to protect the prestige of your council." Attached is a list of twelve cases of Japanese residents being beaten by Chinese people in the Public Concession since the outbreak of hostile actions in this city. I hope you will consider this matter.</p>

<p>Da Yao Company Acts Righteously</p>
<p>Sheltering Refugees is Immensely Beneficial</p>
<p>The four-story building at 177 Avenue Edward VII, owned by Da Yao Company, was leased to the Joint Righteousness Relief Association Hui Lü Rest Hospital and the Red Cross 12th Wounded Soldiers Hospital, jointly established by the alumni of the Nanyang Medical College, almost immediately after its completion. For several months, it has been completely free of charge, without collecting rent. Later, the association added the 5th Refugee Shelter, which was also exempted from rent in the same way. Many soldiers and civilians have benefited. Recently, because the buildings in the refugee shelter have been rented out, the association moved the refugees elsewhere. Only two days later, for some reason, the new landlord suddenly issued an eviction order, giving a tight deadline and demanding that they move out within a few hours. Suddenly, more than two hundred refugees had nowhere to live, causing children to cry and women to weep, creating a scene of panic. They then discussed with the previous landlord, and were allowed to return to their original location, bringing an end to a tragedy of displacement. It is now heard that Messrs. Xi and Xiang personally pleaded with Mr. Lin Dahai, the manager of Da Yao Company, and obtained his consent to cancel the rental and continue to allow them to live there rent-free. From now on, more than two hundred refugees can be temporarily settled and avoid moving again. Mr. Lin's righteousness and public spirit are truly commendable.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 17th), from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM, a certain film company in this city screened films on the Sino-Japanese War at the Nanjing Theater on Avenue Edward VII. No tickets were sold for profit, and only staff IDs from various bureaus in this city were required for admission. However, before 10:00 AM, the theater was full. When the screening began, it was a foreign film, and the war films were never shown. Later, it was learned that this was because proper arrangements had not been made with the concession authorities beforehand, resulting in the temporary cancellation.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Major Fire in Zhabei Chaomibang the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Over a Thousand Straw and Tile Houses Burned Down</p>
<p>At the boundary between the Chinese and leased areas of Zhabei, such as Ruxin Bridge and Guoqing Road, pedestrians are allowed to pass from 5:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day. After 6:00 PM, there are no pedestrians on the roads in the Chinese area of Zhabei. Residents living in the concession who want to return to Zhabei to visit relatives must return to the concession around 5:00 PM. Unexpectedly, at around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, a major fire broke out in Zhabei Chaomibang. The fire covered an area of about one *li*. It was caused by Wang, who was contracted by the Zhao family's store in that area to collect leftover food scraps (commonly known as "dry feet") from a certain place in the concession, and started a fire while boiling oil in a thatched shed. In an instant, about 600 thatched sheds around the area were completely burned down. Approximately 200 tile-roofed bungalows and buildings along the road in nearby lanes were also completely destroyed. The flames spread across Xujiazhai, Jingjiang Road, and Xin Road, burning to Gujia Garden and Qiujiang Road. From the intersection of Qiujiang Road and Xin Road to the Xiajia Guanyintang Temple in the west, all the municipal houses, such as Renhe Glass Factory, Wanfeng Sauce Garden, Hengyi Iron Pipe Factory, Tongyu Cigarette Paper Store, and Songsheng Rice Store (all of which are larger factories and stores), as well as about 200 thatched sheds on the east, west, and south sides of Gujia's residence, were completely burned down. Therefore, a total of about 1,000 straw and tile houses were burned down. Fortunately, Gu's residence was sturdily built, and only the windows and doors were destroyed, while the four walls remained standing. The residents have all taken refuge elsewhere, so there were no deaths or injuries. However, some pigs being fed in the thatched sheds could not be released in time and were burned to death in large numbers. The fire started from the railway side of Chaomibang and ended at the Xiajia Guanyintang Temple on Qiujiang Road, winding for no less than one *li*. The arsonist has already fled and his whereabouts are unknown. After 4:00 PM yesterday, smoke was still seen in several places. Many of the citizens who fled may not know that they have no home to return to.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese textile mills in western Shanghai officially announced the resumption of work, our Chinese workers have refused to work due to unbearable national humiliation. Although the factory owners have tried various methods and ordered the "Naam Wens" (i.e., foremen) to persuade the workers' families to return to work, although a small number of female workers have been moved to return to work, they are afraid of being beaten and insulted by their colleagues. Even newly recruited workers do not dare to enter the factories to work. As a result, the Japanese factories have exhausted their means. It is recently heard that the factory owners have consulted with the police and requested that detectives be stationed in the factories to provide constant protection.</p>

<p>Organizing a Preparatory Committee for National Salvation Savings Funds</p>
<p>The Nine Road Business Associations on Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai, had previously printed an opinion paper on the method of collecting national salvation savings funds from various stores after they reopened, and distributed it to various businesses to solicit their opinions. After the association collected the opinions of various businesses, they all agreed that implementing the collection of savings funds is the most urgent matter at present, and most of them advocated that the National Salvation Savings Fund Committee should be organized by the business associations of this road and the relevant savers, and directly managed to avoid malpractices. Yesterday, the association submitted the above opinions to the 27th Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committee Members for discussion, and it was decided to first organize a Preparatory Committee for National Salvation Savings Funds, and nominated Wu Banjiang, Chen Guangxiang, Zhang Youshui, Sun Bin, and Zhu Wenbin as preparatory committee members. It is heard that the association has already sent letters to various stores to nominate one representative of the savers each, so as to convene a general meeting of savings representatives to organize the National Salvation Savings Fund Committee, so as to start collecting savings funds and become the backing for the government's long-term resistance.</p>

Now the special propaganda group has compiled two types of Chinese and Western language publications, one of which is in Chinese, with approximately 20,000 copies to be printed, costing more than 400 yuan. This amount should have been solicited from the members, but because it has not yet been raised, it is proposed that the association advance the funds for discussion.

<h3 id="e32">County Security Committee's Announcement to Township and Town Chiefs and Deputies <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Security Committee, in order to make the people understand the meaning of the formal organization of the Shanghai County Security Corps, hereby issues an announcement to all township and town chiefs and deputies in the county: Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Security Committee was established, and all counties were ordered to organize county security committees in accordance with the regulations, and to complete the formal organization of the county security corps within one month. After the deadline, personnel will be sent to the county to inspect and supervise strictly. The Shanghai County Security Committee was established on April 1, and should be actively carried out. The security corps is a people's self-defense organization. The purpose is to train people's bodies, unite people's spirits, and strengthen self-defense capabilities. Although the organization of the security corps in the county has been divided into Jia brands, it has not been formally established. The original security corps is a temporary organization that does not meet the requirements and loses the meaning of self-defense. Therefore, after the establishment of the committee, a plan was formulated, and the revised security corps law was promulgated in accordance with the regulations, and the Jia brands were strictly divided, so that the formal security corps could be established as soon as possible. The organization of the security corps is based on each neighborhood as a brand (the quota for each brand shall not be less than ten people, but when the qualified men are not enough ten people, they may combine with other neighborhoods to form a brand), with one brand leader. Each township or town is a Jia (if the qualified men in the township or town are not enough for a brand, they may be merged into the brand of a neighboring township or town, but not more than three townships or towns), with one Jia leader. Each district is a district corps, with one district corps leader. The county is the general corps, with the county chief as the general corps leader. All men between the ages of 20 and 40 are qualified and obligated to join the corps and receive training. The service period after being incorporated is divided into three types: standing, reserve, and reserve. Those who are initially incorporated serve as standing corps soldiers for one year. After the expiration of the term, they serve as reserve corps soldiers for three years. After the expiration of the term, they serve as reserve corps soldiers for six years. The actual service period is only one year. Moreover, during the service period, in addition to focusing on training during agricultural gaps and temporary gatherings in case of emergencies, it will not interfere with personal occupations at other times. Finally, it is necessary to understand the importance of the security corps' mission. In small terms, it is to implement mutual assistance and guard the homeland to seek social peace. In large terms, it is to cultivate the people's military force, defend the country, and maintain the survival of the nation. In short, the security corps is the people's military force, the tool for the people to protect their homes and defend the country, and its nature is completely different from the recruited military police and hired security guards. I hope that the above key points will be clearly publicized to the people in each township and town, so that the public can understand and facilitate the implementation. This is of utmost importance.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Yesterday's Report on the Protracted Labor Strike at the Shishi Xinbao Newspaper <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Labor Union Distributes Subsistence Funds to Forced-Out Workers</p>
<p>Financial Assistance from Postal Workers' Unions</p>
<p>The Newspaper Industry Labor Union released a statement saying that the labor strike at the Shishi Xinbao newspaper has been ongoing for over ten days. Despite repeated mediation efforts from various sectors of society, all have failed due to the newspaper's lack of sincerity. The labor union believes that the newspaper is taking advantage of this time of national crisis to unjustly dismiss all workers, intentionally undermining the entire labor union. Therefore, they have remained steadfast in their determination, firmly advocating for the reinstatement of all workers. The latest information obtained yesterday is detailed below:</p>
<p>Labor Union Supports Forced-Out Workers: Since the newspaper management unreasonably blockaded the workplace and refused work, the workers have faced significant difficulties in maintaining their livelihoods. The Newspaper Industry Labor Union has been actively negotiating with the management, hoping for a swift resolution to the strike. In addition to providing accommodation and meals, the union distributed subsistence funds of fifteen yuan to each unemployed worker yesterday.</p>
<p>Extreme Indignation Among Workers at Various Newspapers: Since the labor strike began, the difficult mediation has remained unresolved. The labor union has consistently avoided escalating the situation to prevent the interruption of national news. They have maintained a spirit of compromise, awaiting mediation and hoping for the newspaper's repentance. However, all workers at the Shenbao, Xinbao, and Shibao newspapers are extremely indignant. They point out that the workers at the Shishi Xinbao had not set any preconditions beforehand, nor did they make any demands afterward, yet the newspaper management has been so intractable, determined to drive the workers to their deaths. They have collectively questioned the special committee for delaying matters. Despite attempts to explain and await mediation, it is feared that a major backlash is inevitable if this labor strike is not resolved quickly.</p>
<p>Recent Statement from the Newspaper Industry Labor Union: The Newspaper Industry Labor Union recently stated that the labor strike at the Shishi Xinbao newspaper remains unresolved. The newspaper management recently claimed to the outside world that the strike has been settled. Yesterday, a responsible spokesperson for the Newspaper Industry Labor Union solemnly stated that the strike was initiated by the newspaper management's planned destruction of the workers' organization. The truth of the matter and the mediation process are well understood by the public. The labor union, considering the survival of the workers, will not compromise and hastily conclude the matter. The newspaper management's claim that the strike has been settled is merely an attempt to deceive themselves. The spokesperson also mentioned that the union recently received a leaflet signed by the "National Salvation and Elimination of Traitors Group" claiming that the newspaper has Japanese backing and capital. The union also received a copy yesterday. However, after reading the "Letter Regarding the Shishi Xinbao Labor Strike" disclosed in the Shiwuri Longbao on the 15th, the union believes that the workers did it. However, the union members deeply understand that labor-management cooperation is essential for survival. Since the start of this strike, the workers have consistently insisted on returning to work under the conditions that existed before April 2nd, without making any new demands, hoping to cooperate with the newspaper management to promote the newspaper's development. Therefore, it is highly contradictory for such a destructive leaflet to come from the workers' side.</p>
<p>Continuous Expressions of Sympathy from All Quarters: In recent days, the newspaper's labor strike has seen muted news due to vigorous mediation efforts from various parties. Meanwhile, expressions of indignation from various labor unions in Shanghai are surging. It is also reported that the two postal workers' unions have donated money to express sympathy to the forced-out workers. The messages of sympathy from various parties are recorded below:</p>
<p>Postal Workers' Unions Donate Funds to Express Sympathy: Our unions volunteered to mediate, but we failed to gain trust and our efforts were unsuccessful, for which we feel extremely ashamed. The details of the negotiations have been reported in the newspapers and are hopefully clear to all, so we will not elaborate further. We have specially sent Zhu Xuefan and Huang Gongfu as representatives to express our sympathy and present a donation of fifty yuan. We hope you will accept it with a smile. This small sum is not meant as substantial aid, but rather as a token of our sympathy. We hope you will continue to fight, and that final success will surely belong to your union.</p>
<p>Shanghai Seamen's Union and Telecommunications: We have recently learned that the Shishi Xinbao newspaper management is forcing workers to print other newspapers, seeking unilateral benefits while ignoring the workers' suffering, and ruthlessly destroying and intentionally undermining them. Our union, standing on the side of labor, expresses our sympathy to all of you regarding this dispute. We have telegraphed and sent representatives to express our sympathy and provide all possible assistance. Regards from the Shanghai Branch Organizing Committee of the Chinese Seamen's General Union.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Labor Strike at the Qihua Company <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the Qihua Company on Nanjing Road was dissolved and liquidated, it is currently selling off its inventory. On the afternoon of the 16th, a labor strike suddenly occurred, and the store remained closed yesterday. It is learned that the company's employees had previously formed a wage demand group, requesting the full payment of back wages, commissions, and three months' severance pay, which had already been acknowledged by the management. On the 11th, the wage demand group surrounded the liquidator and creditor representatives, forcing them to evaluate the goods that evening. The store then reopened voluntarily the next day. The cash earned after reopening was first used to pay off all wage arrears, totaling over five thousand yuan. On the 16th, they demanded advance payment of severance pay amounting to over five thousand yuan. The liquidator proposed deducting the employees' outstanding debt for goods, which the employee representatives refused, immediately posting strike notices and compelling all employees to strike. Subsequently, the manager negotiated with the liquidator and agreed not to deduct the debt, but rather pay it in advance. The employee representatives still refused to return to work, adding further conditions, demanding that an additional three thousand yuan in commissions be paid that day, and also demanding advance payment of the entire month's wages for April, totaling over one thousand yuan, otherwise they would take appropriate measures. The liquidator, Xu Yongzuo, an accountant, in order to fulfill his responsibilities, had no choice but to reject these harsh conditions. Fearing that the employees would take some action that would cause losses to the company, he had no choice but to temporarily lock the company on the 17th, in order to preserve the assets, and await a resolution. The notice posted at the company entrance is transcribed below: We recently received a letter from the company's liquidator, which states: The company's employees have threatened to demand payment of severance pay and commissions within a limited time, refusing to deduct the outstanding debt for goods, and are engaging in a labor strike, threatening to take appropriate measures, and making unreasonable demands, demanding advance payment of the entire month's wages for April. The liquidator's duty lies in being unable to endure these demands. Before the employees' strike is resolved, the company will be temporarily locked from the morning of the 17th of this month, and no striking personnel or any other person will be allowed to enter. The deputy manager is expected to handle this matter accordingly. As for all severance pay and commissions, the liquidator could have, at the deputy manager's request, paid them in advance. Now that the employees are using strike tactics to threaten and refuse to deduct the debt for goods, and demand advance payment of April's wages, this is obviously an overreaching action. The company's losses suffered from the strike should be compensated by the employees. Moreover, due to this reason, there is doubt as to whether severance pay and commissions should be paid. Even if, after consideration, payment is possible, the liquidator has the right to weigh the payment date, and the employees' outstanding debt for goods should be deducted according to law, etc. This is hereby announced. Management Department.</p>

<p>A Budget of 100,000 Yuan Scheduled to Start Work Next Month</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, considering the recent warming weather and the impending outbreak of epidemics, as well as the numerous deaths resulting from the month-long Battle of Shanghai, deems epidemic prevention work even more important.

<h3 id="e43">The Municipal Council's Stance on Prostitution Ban <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Currently Instructing Police to Do Their Best to Prevent It</p>
<p>A Total of Over One Thousand One Hundred People Have Been Arrested</p>
<p>Previously, the Citizens' Federation, in view of the gradual increase in prostitutes in the concession, sent a letter to the Municipal Council to ban it. It is learned that the Municipal Council replied to the federation yesterday, stating briefly that according to the council's investigation, the number of prostitutes in the concession has gradually decreased, and all police officers have been strictly ordered to do their best to prevent it at all times and in all places. From January last year to April this year, more than one thousand one hundred people have been arrested for prostitution.

<h3 id="e44">The Stamp Tax and Liquor Bureau Urges Collection of Summer Licenses <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Yizhi, the newly appointed director of the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Liquor Bureau, and Shen Zonglian, the deputy director, are urging the collection of summer liquor licenses tax. Yesterday, a notice was posted, stating the matter as follows: The case is based on a report from Gu Daosheng, director of the Shanghai Branch of the Chongqi Liquor License Tax Collection Bureau, stating that Qian Wenda, director of the Shanghai branch under his jurisdiction, reported that tax collection in the jurisdiction has been suspended due to the war, and the situation has been reported. However, it is now early April, and it is time to start collecting for the summer season. Liquor merchants, except in the area occupied by Japanese soldiers and the affected area, have mostly resumed business in the Nanshi area. Although the market is currently depressed, liquor license taxes should be paid in accordance with regulations. Unexpectedly, everyone is watching and delaying the renewal of licenses, and it is rumored that someone is stirring up trouble in the meantime, gathering to discuss under the guise of a certain public association, using the excuse of seeking exemption after the war. As a result, the branch has repeatedly sent personnel to urge collection, but they are ignored. Given this situation, how can the future of tax collection be planned? Therefore, it is especially reported for your consideration, etc. Based on this, after investigating the aforementioned tax, it is not easy to collect in the autumn when the situation is calm, and it is even more inevitable that merchants will resist payment by using the excuse of war. If strict collection is not enforced, tax collection will be even more difficult. Based on the foregoing, in addition to instructing, it is appropriate to promptly issue a notice, requiring all liquor merchants to comply accordingly, and must pay taxes in accordance with regulations and renew their licenses on time, without any resistance, lest they be investigated. It is hereby announced.</p>

<p>The Cosmetics Industry Association sent a letter to its members, stating that the losses suffered by members of the association who were affected by the disaster and had their properties burned down this time are quite large. The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce believes that since the cessation of hostilities in the war zone, there have been fire incidents, which proves that the fires in the war zone cannot be completely attributed to war disasters, and that fire disasters also exist. The Insurance Association has paid attention to this case. In order to implement the main purpose of the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, and to seek appropriate compensation for members to maintain their business, the Executive Committee has resolved to send a letter to all members to report and handle the matter. Therefore, all affected members are especially requested to send personnel immediately, bringing their insurance policies to the association for reporting, or if the insurance policies have been paid to a broker, then provide the date of insurance, the insured amount, the insurance policy number, the name of the company, etc., to the association for promotion.</p>

<p>Since the Unemployed Relief Committee for Stevedores of this city separately reported to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau for its establishment, it has been actively carrying out relief work, and requested charitable organizations to allocate grain and funds for distribution to unemployed workers. Yesterday, the committee convened a joint meeting of representatives from various wharves. Gan Xinmin and Liu Defu reported on the progress of the relief work, and issued a declaration, stating that since the January 28 Incident in Shanghai, all industries have declined, and factories and businesses have closed down. The number of unemployed stevedores in this city is very large due to the war and the anti-Japanese strike at Japanese-owned wharves. It is found that the general stevedore workers have no fixed lives, relying on the wages temporarily employed each day for a living. The income is very small, and it is difficult to even stay adequately fed. They have no money or grain from the previous day, and lack savings. During the recent Shanghai incident, they were displaced and unemployed, suffering unspeakable pain. Families of several people are sitting idle, awaiting death. Therefore, the members of the Stevedore Workers' Union and the representatives of various district unions convened a meeting to organize the Unemployed Relief Committee for Stevedores of Shanghai City, elected members, responsible for carrying out and begging for aid from charitable organizations. We will also collect funds, to achieve the purpose of relief, benefiting tens of thousands of unemployed workers. We have reported the process of establishment and the situation of relief to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau. We hereby declare this.</p>

<p>Was Immediately Taken to the Police Station</p>
<p>After the war, many children of Shanghai residents were lost due to displacement, adding to the financial resources of the abductors. Therefore, the investigators of the Relief Association, Chen Shaoting, Lin Yongfang, etc., made great efforts to investigate every day. Yesterday morning, the investigators were investigating overnight in the Lunbu area. They saw a woman on the Tai Koo Company's Dean steamboat with two children. When asked, the woman claimed to be Zhu Zhao, from Wuhu, Anhui. She claimed that one child was her son, six years old, and the other was her nephew, five years old. However, the accent of the child being looked at was of northern origin, not like a son. When asked what the child's name was, the woman shockingly said that the six-year-old's name was "Little Ba Xi" and the five-year-old's name was "Little Kid." The investigators were amused, as "Little Ba Xi" and "Little Kid" were names to replace the children's actual names. How could there be a reason to use them as names? Knowing it was abduction, they asked where she was taking them. She replied that she was taking them to Xiamen, but when asked where in Xiamen, she said she was still undecided. This further proved that the woman was an accomplice of the abductors, accompanying the abducted children to the Xiamen wharf for handover. They immediately notified the patrol police of the water police station and took them to the police station for questioning. After an interrogation, they were immediately sent to the local court for interrogation.</p>

<p>At about 7 p.m. on the ninth of this month, a large number of bandits armed with Mauser pistols and rifles suddenly rushed into the Shenghelong Oil Factory on Guangfu Road, north of Caojiadu Port in western Shanghai, and only robbed a single gift certificate. District Chief Ren of the Sixth District ordered Police Officer Xu to lead detectives to arrest seven robbers, including Zhang Rijin.

It is now learned that after Captain Lu questioned the criminals separately, they confessed that the principal offender was named Lu Ajin, from Chongming, and had more than 20 accomplices, possessing many Mauser pistols and rifles, all hiding near the Maigen Road station in Zhabei, specializing in robbery. After receiving the confession, Captain Lu immediately ordered all detectives from the Sixth District to arrest the principal offender. Xia Pinshan, the leader of the detective team in the district, was ordered to arrest the main offender, but because it was located in Zhabei, there was no way to start. After discovering that the main offender sometimes went to the Xiaoshadu area, he immediately led detectives Li Guiqing, Tang Bingxiang, Li Jinqing, Cao Chuqiao, Chen Keqing, and Pei Yunzhang to the Xiaoshadu Yaoshui Lane area, and waited day and night. At 6 a.m. the day before yesterday, as the sky was about to dawn, they arrested the wanted criminal Lu Ajin (also known as Little Slippery). They found twenty yuan in cash, a gold ring, and four dimes. He was immediately taken to the district and questioned. He confessed his name was Lu Ajin, 25 years old, from Chongming, living in Zhabei, and admitted to instigating the robbery conspiracy without denying it. Yesterday, the Sixth District prepared a document and submitted it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>The French Concession authorities have recently been very strict in cracking down on privately operated opium dens and red pills within the concession. As a result, the police have been making daily raids, sending those arrested to the court for trial. On the afternoon of the 14th of this month, at 10:00 PM, the political department of the French police received a tip that reactionary elements were holding secret meetings at No. 7 Baoxing Lane on Avenue Edward VII. Officer Ban (transliteration) was dispatched by Zhou Zhongxi Dao Ban to make the arrests. No communists were found, but an opium den was discovered. On the spot, Zhang Chenshi, suspected of operating the den privately, along with assistants Bei (transliteration), Yang Xiaoru, Shen Panlin, and customers Yuan Yulin, Zhou Linsheng, Hua (transliteration), Huang Junqing, Shi Dan, Lu Youcai, Zhu Fuying, Chen Ziqing, Liu Bingquan, Liu Qijin, Chen Yanfeng, Wang Jinyu, Sheng Bai (transliteration), Shen Tonglu, Wang Cailin, Huang Shiqi, Rong (transliteration), Gu Jin (transliteration), Zhu Huolin, Huang Gusheng, Yin Chunbo, Pan Ruidang, and Liu Zhaozhang, totaling twenty-seven people, were arrested. Ten opium pipes, twenty-odd opium lamps, sixteen opium pots, two large cans of opium dregs, three hundred tin boxes, and a large quantity of opium paraphernalia parts were seized. All the individuals were taken to the police station and were sent to the Second Special District Court the day before yesterday. At 2:00 PM, Judge Li Changnian, along with clerk Wu Shan and prosecutor Wu Xiaoke, opened the trial in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, prosecuting under Article 11 of the Anti-Opium Law. He stated that the first defendant, Zhang Chenshi, was formerly a prostitute with a record of being detained for operating as a prostitute without a license, and requested that she be investigated according to the law. Zhang Chenshi testified that the opium den was opened by her husband, and after his death, she kept the opium paraphernalia, intending to obtain a license and then operate it for profit. Zhang Zubei, who was apprehended the next day, testified that the opium den was opened by his brother, and after his death, he took over but has now ceased operations. Yang Xiaoru and Shen Panlin confessed to being partners. Yuan Yulin and others all stated that they were visiting friends or doing small business and were arrested, denying opium smoking. Two or three of them hired lawyers for defense. The court declared the debate closed and scheduled the sentencing for the 20th. The defendants were temporarily detained at the police station.</p>
<p>Also on the same day, a detective discovered an opium den at No. 19 Shengping Lane on Avenue Edward VII and arrested Zhou Akun from Suzhou, suspected of operating the den privately, and customers Wang Jinren (22 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 22 Hualong Road), Zhang Xirong (43 years old, local, residing at No. 309 Guangdong Road), and Zhu Guolin (44 years old, local, residing at No. 359 Guangdong Road), totaling four people. Three opium pipes, one hundred boxes of opium, seven large and small copper trays, lamp stands, and other paraphernalia parts were seized. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi presented the case, prosecuting under Articles 11 of the Anti-Opium Law, and submitted the evidence. Zhou Akun confessed to privately selling opium and allowing smoking without dispute. Wang Jinren testified that he bought opium to treat hemorrhoids and was arrested. Zhang and Zhu both stated that they were visiting friends to discuss electrical lighting business and were arrested, denying opium smoking. They also hired lawyers for defense. After examining the testimonies, Judge Li Changnian declared the debate closed and scheduled the sentencing for the 20th. Defendant Zhou Akun was remanded in custody, while Wang Jinren, Zhang Xirong, and Zhu Shunlin were each required to post bail of 500 yuan in cash. Those who could not post bail were remanded in custody. The defending lawyers requested a reduction in bail, which the judge approved, reducing it to 300 yuan in cash for each person. The defendants immediately paid the bail and were released pending further instructions. In these two cases, many young people and respectable merchants were among the opium smokers, succumbing to the dark sea, which is truly lamentable.</p>

<p>Yan Huijing Telegraphed a Report on the Situation at the League of Nations</p>
<p>Central Leaders Discuss Countermeasures</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Huijing sent a long telegram to the central government on the evening of the 16th, reporting on the situation of the League of Nations Special Committee. On the 17th, both morning and afternoon, Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek invited Luo Wen'gan, Chen Mingshu, He Yingqin, Gu Mengyu, Li Shizeng, Zhang Renjie, Guo Taiqi, and others to Tangshan to continue discussing countermeasures, which ended after 3:00 PM. It is reported that the main points of the discussion included: (1) Collecting materials for the General Assembly to reference; (2) Stating China's minimum level of concession; (3) Methods to deal with the puppet state's refusal to allow Gu to leave the Customs, and the safety of the League of Nations investigation team along the way; (4) Reporting on recent provocative actions by the Japanese army. It is reported that domestic party and government issues were also discussed during the meeting. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo told reporters on the 17th: "For the past twenty years, I have devoted myself to judicial affairs, and diplomacy is not my specialty. This spring, the central government ordered me to take temporary responsibility. I believe that the rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every citizen, so I resolutely took office, constantly fearing that I would fail in my duty and let down the central government's trust. I have repeatedly asked President Wang for permission to resign, but it has not been granted. Before the central government determines my successor, I must continue to do my best to overcome the national crisis." (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Guo Taiqi went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM on the 17th to review Yan Huijing's report on the League of Nations telegram with Foreign Minister Luo. Guo believes that Japan is not sincere about the ceasefire talks and plans to delay his trip to Shanghai for two or three days. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>More Than One Hundred Railway Workers Were Arrested by the Japanese</p>
<p>(Harbin) Regarding the Japanese military train derailment, the Eastern Railway specially convened a board of directors and supervisors on the 15th, passing the Russian director's proposal to require the puppet state to take thorough measures to protect the railway. Li Shaogeng, on behalf of the railway, apologized to Russia. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) On the 14th, the train from Harbin to Suifenhe on the Harbin-Suifenhe line of the Eastern Railway was derailed, and traffic was interrupted for three hours. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Diplomatic Authorities Talk About the Future of the League of Nations Special Meeting <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Diplomatic authorities say: (1) British Ambassador Lampson's proposal for a six-month Japanese troop withdrawal plan in his capacity as a mediator was originally based on Japan's opinion, but in order to respect the spirit of the previous League of Nations General Assembly resolution, our country requested the General Assembly to interpret it. However, although Ambassador Lampson has this proposal, he is not firm, and our country has no absolute obligation to accept it. In short, our country will take the League of Nations resolution as the principle for the issue of the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai, and at the same time seek a solution without hindering the spirit of an independent country. (2) The reason for the establishment of the League of Nations Special Committee is to increase the strength to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. This time, due to our request to convene the General Assembly, the pros and cons of the future are difficult to predict. The League of Nations' handling of this case is directly related to the interests of China and Japan, and indirectly related to world peace. The fact that important figures from the United Kingdom and the United States are all going to Geneva is enough to show its importance. Before the General Assembly issues its plan, we are unwilling to make any empty talk. (3) Regarding the issue of representatives leaving the Customs, it concerns the entire action of the League of Nations investigation team. No party can openly object. Lytton recently told people that Gu's position is on the side of the League of Nations. If he cannot go, we don't need to go either. It can be seen the attitude of the team towards this matter. The saying that our country will send troops to accompany the investigators has not yet been decided. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Liu Zhenhua and Zhang Fang arrived in Hankou from Xinyang on a special train on the morning of the 17th to discuss plans to suppress the communist bandits in the border area of Henan and Hubei with He Chengjun.

<p>(Hankou) Ma Lingfu, chief staff officer of the Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Suiyuan frontier defense, arrived in Hankou with Liu Zhenhua on the 17th. According to him, Liu believes that the fundamental way to suppress bandits is to suppress them severely, not to recruit them. Although there are now more than 30,000 bandits in Henan, there is severe internal strife. Wang Tai and Cui Erdan have already fought each other. If Henan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Shaanxi can effectively jointly suppress them, they can be eliminated. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Stimson's Visit to Geneva Carries Great Significance</p>
<p>The League of Nations Will Follow the United States' Lead in Future Actions</p>
<p>Geneva, 15th (National News Agency dispatch). U.S. Secretary of State Stimson had lunch with British Foreign Secretary Simon today to discuss disarmament and Far Eastern issues. It is reported that Simon stated that the United Kingdom could not agree to the Tydio international army proposal, believing that the plan would be difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Havas dispatch). The arrival of the U.S. Secretary of State in Geneva is an unprecedented event, which seemed impossible not long ago. This person's speculation contradicts Stimson's declaration, arguing that his arrival must involve more important matters than just attending the conference. During President Harding's election, thirty-one members of the Republican Party strongly opposed the majority opinion and advocated for the United States to join the League of Nations. Stimson was one of them, and the recent rapprochement between the United States and the League of Nations relies solely on Stimson's efforts. Should this then be seen as Stimson's preparation to bring the United States closer to the League of Nations, even to the point of joining it? Such speculation ignores Washington's diplomatic policy, as its diplomatic direction will not change for the time being. However, Stimson's trip to Geneva seems to be abandoning part of the U.S.'s long-proclaimed opposition to the League of Nations policy, and before departing for Geneva, Stimson must have carefully considered global public opinion regarding his special trip. Therefore, the reason for Stimson's trip must be extremely important. By studying private remarks about Stimson's trip outside of Washington and the various important issues of today, one can know that the current situation of the Asian issue and the dispute over the disarmament issue have both made Stimson feel the need to personally contact European leaders. Therefore, he met with Tydio in Paris yesterday and with Simon in Geneva today, so that he could directly study a solution to the two major issues most related to the United States with them. As for the conflict in the Far East, everyone knows that the League of Nations and the United States are aligned. However, observing the past few weeks, it seems that the resolution of the Far Eastern issue is greatly related to the degree of cooperation between Washington and the League of Nations, as the effectiveness of the League of Nations' actions largely depends on the attitude of the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The *Millard's Review* Comments on the Trend of US-Soviet Cooperation <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Two Countries' Policies Toward Japan Are Almost Identical</p>
<p>Recognition of Soviet Russia Is Unrelated to the Political System</p>
<p>The *World Society* translates the *Millard's Review*, saying that this newspaper has previously discussed that the current developing Far Eastern situation will inevitably make the relationship between the United States and Russia closer than at any time since the establishment of the Soviet government. The U.S. State Department recently stated that the United States has no intention of changing its attitude toward Russia. When Moscow sent out hints a few weeks ago that the United States might recognize the Soviet Union, Washington immediately denied it. However, despite these expressions and denials, the United States' attitude toward Soviet Russia will inevitably gradually "soften." We know that the movement within the United States to recognize Soviet Russia has the strong support of Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and if the "difficult period" in the United States does not end quickly, public opinion will increasingly tend to aid Borah's proposition. Recently, Moscow has repeatedly transmitted news about US-Soviet rapprochement. Most recently, Communist Party leader Yagoda claimed that if Japan attacks the Soviet Union, a US-Soviet alliance would be the inevitable result. Regardless of this claim, the fact that the attitudes of the United States and Russia toward Japan are almost identical is obvious to all. If Japan does not refrain from pressing forward, the policies of the United States and the policies of Soviet Russia will be parallel lines. Regardless of whether the United States recognizes Soviet Russia or not, the idea of ​​a Russo-American alliance can be dismissed as impossible, but if Japan's aggression in the Far East progresses further, US-Russian relations will inevitably be forced to become closer. The formation of the U.S.'s Far Eastern policy is largely in the hands of Stimson, who is currently in Geneva participating in the Disarmament Conference. He currently faces three major issues: the Philippine issue, the Manchurian issue, and the issue of relations with Russia. Regarding the Philippine issue, Stimson's hands are being constrained by Congress, and the U.S.'s Far Eastern policy is currently being ignored by Japan. In this situation, it would not be surprising if Stimson is induced to observe the Far Eastern dispute from a new perspective when he meets with Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov in Geneva. There is something related that can be mentioned here: the United States has always been willing to reconcile and cooperate with any government or governments whose domestic political system is different from that of the United States. The relationship between the United States and Imperial Russia during the American Civil War is a good historical proof of this situation. At that time, although Russia did not provide armed assistance to the "Union," it always clearly stated that if Britain aided the South, Russia would add strength to the side of the "Union." Therefore, during the turbulent years of 1861 to 1865, US-Russian relations were extremely close. We should once again state that the United States' recognition of the Soviet Union does not imply approval of its political system. The American people never approved of the autocratic system of Imperial Russia, but that did not hinder the many years of friendly relations between the two countries.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Russian Newspaper's Warning to Japan <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Saying that the Japanese Military Clique Is Trying to Find an Excuse to Challenge Russia</p>
<p>If They Brazenly Do This, They Will Suffer the Consequences</p>
<p>Moscow, 16th (National News Agency dispatch). The Soviet Russian Communist Party's organ, *Pravda*, issued a solemn warning today, showing that Moscow is deeply shocked by the situation in the Far East. The newspaper declared that the Japanese military clique is currently seeking an excuse, hoping to declare war on Soviet Russia, because the Japanese are not satisfied after occupying Manchuria and obtaining the wealthy three provinces from China, and are preparing to invade Siberia. The Japanese imperialists are currently making large-scale preparations for war actions outside of Manchuria. Their so-called active policies all follow a definite and unchanging purpose, which is to turn the places they occupy into a field of disturbance, hoping to use this as an excuse to start aggression again. After detailing the Japanese conspiracy, the newspaper issued a solemn warning, solemnly declaring that Soviet Russia is prepared to resist any aggression, and will act according to its strength. Finally, it also said that if the Japanese imperialists misunderstand Soviet Russia's true spirit of peace as weakness and incompetence, and not enough to defend their territory, then they will suffer the consequences.</p>
<p>Moscow, 16th (TASS dispatch). Today, the *Truth News* here published a severe editorial on the provocative acts of the White Russians in Manchuria and the Japanese conspiracy to inspect the Soviet Embassy in Harbin, entitled "Warning to Provocateurs." It said that the old tune of "bandits" from last autumn will be repeated again. The so-called "bandits" from last autumn to winter were actually all instructed by the Japanese military authorities, given money and weapons to create chaos, as an excuse for the Japanese army to occupy Manchuria. However, seeing the recent situation, the Japanese imperialists may temporarily abandon the old tune of "bandits" and use a more detailed plan. The Japanese imperialists have now changed their plan and are using explosives. Those White Russians would not dare to take any action without a word from the Japanese military authorities. Now they are plotting to blow up the Songhua River Bridge and the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway to provoke a conflict between the Soviet Union and Japan. Under the initiative of the Japanese, dozens of innocent workers and staff members on the Chinese Eastern Railway and Soviet citizens have been arrested and subjected to torture in Harbin's prisons. General Ma Zhanshan, who has betrayed repeatedly, has now reappeared on stage, and there are absurd rumors that he is within Soviet territory. This conspiracy of the Japanese imperialists has fully demonstrated that their ambitious military clique is eager to try again, plotting to start trouble outside of Manchuria. The working people of the Soviet Union are fully aware of this provocative conspiracy. The Soviet Union's policy can be changed, it fights for peace, and in foreign affairs, it will never deviate from this principle. If the Japanese imperialists believe that the Soviet Union's love of peace is a sign of cowardice and inability to defend its borders, they are greatly mistaken. The article concludes by saying that the Soviet Union absolutely does not allow any country to invade its territory, nor does it want to establish a buffer state with a part of its territory. To protect the integrity of its territory, the working people of the Soviet Union have fought and won against invaders. If a new danger comes, they will also do their best to defend their country. However, what we must not ignore is that the Japanese soldiers are now like unbridled horses, and they are afraid that they will rush around without knowing where to stop.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The *Eastern Times*'s Counter-Propaganda <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Litvinov Meets with Japanese Reporters</p>
<p>The Soviet Government Declares It is Not True</p>
<p>Moscow, 16th (TASS dispatch). TASS has obtained a notice from the Soviet government stating that the news carried in Japanese newspapers that Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov met with a reporter from the *Japan Japan News* in Geneva and expressed his views on the situation in the Far East is completely unfounded. Litvinov has never met with any Japanese reporter in Geneva or elsewhere. The intention of this fabricated report is very obvious, especially at a time when Japanese newspapers are using the Manchurian White Russian's provocative conspiracy to carry out attacks against the Soviet Union. It can be seen that the purpose of the Japanese newspapers' spreading rumors is nothing more than to take the opportunity to provoke and carry out their counter-propaganda.</p>

<p>Private Individuals Are Not Allowed to Possess Troops</p>
<p>To Safeguard National Authority</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Reuters). President Hindenburg's private letter to the Minister of the Interior was published today, expressing President Hindenburg's unwillingness for any private individuals in Germany to possess troops. It is said that he approved the order to dissolve the National Socialist Party's Sturmabteilung (SA) because this measure was necessary to safeguard national authority. If other organizations are found to have similar military organizations, they will also be subject to the same treatment. The German president's letter was published because National Socialist newspapers attacked the Republican Party, accusing the party of having an Iron Front organization to resist any possible coup by the National Socialist Party. After the Sturmabteilung was dissolved, the Republican Party leader had voluntarily dissolved its Iron Front.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Late Match King's Numerous Crimes During His Lifetime <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Another Rumor About the Reason for His Suicide</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (National News Agency dispatch). Regarding the various malfeasance of Match King Kreuger during his lifetime, it is now reported that according to investigations, Kreuger had been engaging in various forgery activities since as early as 1925, and his crimes were so numerous that even if his business was going well, he would not be able to escape the net. The most recent new discovery is the contract that Kreuger's Continental Investment Corporation signed with former Spanish leader Rivera in 1925. According to the contract, Kreuger's Continental Investment Corporation lent the Spanish government 180 million pesetas (Spanish currency) with an annual interest rate of 1.8%, in exchange for the monopoly on match manufacturing in Spain. It has now been discovered that this contract was also forged, and there are other astonishing discoveries. The Kreuger case investigation committee has dispatched specialists to Paris to obtain Rivera's signature sample. However, according to the three people who have been arrested in connection with the Kreuger case, Kreuger fabricated numerous documents during his lifetime, too numerous to mention. This is just one example.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Havas dispatch). After the exposure of the case of the Swedish Match King Kreuger forging documents during his lifetime, the German financial world has had a very negative impression. Those who once recognized Kreuger as a perfect person in the business world now denounce him as an unprecedented fraudster. Outside reports say that the entanglement between Kreuger and Morgan Bank in New York was the direct cause of his suicide. Previously, Morgan Bank had agreed to lend Kreuger 3 million US dollars, but Kreuger needed to use the shares of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation as collateral. However, after Kreuger borrowed the money, he did not hand over the shares. Morgan Bank then ordered Kreuger to hand them over immediately, or return the money. Kreuger then left the United States for France, still hoping to raise 3 million US dollars in Paris to save the situation. After arriving in the French capital, he begged for help in vain, and in despair, he committed suicide. It is also rumored that Kreuger's forged Italian bonds were about to be handed over to the Italian government.</p>

<p>Repeated Meetings with Zhang Xueliang, Rong Zhen, and Others</p>
<p>Detailed Study of the South Manchuria Railway Parallel Line Issue</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence. The League of Nations Investigation Team has been conducting various investigation work in Peiping for several days. A brief account is as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting with Rong Zhen and Wang Yizhe. At the reception tea party on the evening of their arrival in Peiping, Sir Lytton and others from the League of Nations Investigation Team met with Rong Zhen, the former Chief of Staff of the Northeast Border Defense Command, and inquired about Rong's account of the September 18th Incident witnessed in Shenyang. Due to time constraints, they only discussed the general outline. At 10:30 a.m. on the 13th, Lytton and the other five commissioners formally received Rong and Wang Yizhe, the commander of the 7th Brigade of the Northeast Army, at the Beijing Hotel, and discussed the situation in detail. Wang was stationed in Beidaying at the beginning of the Shenyang Incident, and the Japanese army on the South Manchuria Railway opened fire to provoke, and his troops bore the brunt. Wang reported the truth one by one. Rong also stated that the reason for not resisting the Japanese army's unprovoked provocations in Shenyang was to believe that the League of Nations would be able to sanction Japan's atrocities, so as to avoid the devastation of the region and the suffering of foreign nationals. Finally, Lytton asked Rong and Wang to prepare a written account of the September 18th Incident and submit it to the team for reference during the investigation and report to the League of Nations. The conversation lasted about two hours before Rong and Wang bid farewell.</p>
<p>Discussing the Parallel Line Issue. At 3:00 p.m. on the 13th, the investigation team met with Chinese representative Gu Weijun and Japanese representative Yoshida. During the meeting, the issues of leaving the customs and the parallel lines of the South Manchuria Railway were discussed in detail. Yoshida had a heated argument with Gu on the spot. Regarding the matter of leaving the customs, Yoshida said that the Japanese side welcomed the investigation team leaving the customs, but regarding the issue of Gu Weijun's accompanying them, Yoshida repeated the instructions of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, nothing more than promising to provide protection within the possible scope. The opinions of the commissioners of the investigation team were that if they could not be fully responsible for Gu's protection, they would not leave the customs. Regarding the South Manchuria Railway parallel line issue, Yoshida stated that China's construction of parallel railways violated the Sino-Japanese treaty. Gu Weijun then pointed out that although the articles in the annex to a certain Sino-Japanese treaty stipulated that railways could not be built within 100 Chinese li of the South Manchuria Railway, the Datong Railway currently being built by China was more than 200 Chinese li away from the South Manchuria Railway, which did not violate the treaty provisions, and that the treaty had not been formally signed by the Chinese side. Yoshida was speechless and the debate stopped. Immediately afterwards, the commissioners and Gu and the Secretary-General Haas went to Shuncheng Wangfu at around 4 o'clock to hold the second talk with Zhang Xueliang. Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, Mi Chunlin, Rong Zhen, and other former senior officials from the Northeast all attended, but the Japanese representatives did not participate. They discussed various Northeast issues. Lytton inquired in detail about the South Manchuria Railway parallel line issue. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 p.m. Overall, the main points of the investigation team's research concentrated on the South Manchuria parallel line issue. It was decided that the third meeting would continue at 4:00 p.m. on the 14th. In addition to the people who participated on the 13th, Liu Zhe and Wang Yizhe also joined. It is said that after the third meeting, it was decided that no more meetings would be held and that all actual materials would be sorted out. On the morning of the 14th, the investigation team also held a routine meeting to discuss and decide on the itinerary for the first trip to the Eastern Provinces.</p>
<p>Receiving Representatives of the People. The investigation team began receiving representatives of various groups from the 12th. That afternoon, they received Xiong Xiling, Chen Zhenxian, Ye Shuheng, Liao Shigong, Wang Wenxian, and others, representatives of the Chinese League of Nations Association. First, Xiong and others presented a written report, including a welcome letter, a booklet on the Sino-Japanese conflict, and a memorandum. Then, they talked and raised various important issues, asking the team to pay attention. Lytton expressed his satisfaction.</p>
<p>Our Country Delivers Memorandum. The memorandum delivered by our country to the League of Nations Investigation Team includes more than a hundred pending cases, such as Sino-Japanese negotiations on roads and mines in the Northeast, the Wanbaoshan Incident, and anti-Chinese sentiment among Koreans, all of which are explained in detail. This memorandum has been drafted and completed, and Chinese representative Gu Weijun divided it into several major parts and handed it to Lytton. As of the 12th, only the section on the Eastern Province Railway parallel line issue had not yet been delivered. It is expected that Gu will present it in person within a day or two for reference when going to the Northeast for investigation in the future.</p>
<p>Decision to Reject the Puppet State's Reception. The League of Nations Investigation Team decided to leave the customs on a special train of the Beining Railway. The fact that Chinese representative Xian Weijun accompanied them did not change due to the puppet state's telegram of rejection. After the investigation team arrives in the Northeast, it will immediately engage in practical investigation work. Regarding the so-called Manchurian State's reception, because the world's countries have not recognized the "Manchurian State," it was decided to reject it. However, the investigation team can accept the reception from the Japanese Kwantung Army. Because the team is not accepting the puppet state's reception, the Beining Railway special train has begun to be renovated, including bathrooms, sanatoriums, cold storage rooms, laundry rooms, etc., which were not previously prepared, for the team's long-term use after leaving the customs. Also, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Investigation Team, Berridge, met with various reporters at the Beijing Hotel at 6:30 p.m. on the 13th. During the conversation, a Japanese reporter raised several absurd questions, asking what attitude the investigation team would take when the Manchurian State held a banquet. Berridge replied, "For example, in ordinary social situations, if a gentleman invites guests, we will of course participate. If a non-gentleman invites guests, we may not attend." The Japanese reporter also said that the Manchurian State rejected Gu Weijun's entry because Gu had plans to hinder the new country. Berridge only shook his head and smiled without saying anything.

<p>The Intellectual Community All Supports the Ainu</p>
<p>The *Osaka Mainichi Shimbun* says that more than 25,000 Ainu in Hokkaido oppose the previous protection law and advocate autonomous construction. When Hokkaido Prefectural Government's Social Affairs Section Chief Kita heard the news, he rushed to the Ainu village in Asahikawa City to suppress them. However, due to the firm opposition of 141 towns to entrusted management, the full-province representatives, Tenkawa Keizo and Asahikawa Ainu representative Matsui, and others went to Beijing together to petition. At the same time, they held a speech convention in Tokyo. In academic circles, people also rose up to encourage the Ainu and were willing to be their backup. For example, Northeast Imperial University anthropology professor Kita, Tokyo Imperial University linguistics assistant professor Kindaichi, Hokkaido University entomology professor Kono, and other famous scholars all sympathize with them. Therefore, the situation may expand.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Japanese Army's Invasion of Mongolia <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Major Matsui and Major Iwai Were Killed by Mongolian Soldiers</p>
<p>The Purpose of Invading Mongolia Was to Incite Various Princes to Become Independent</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence. Since Japan's secret exploration of Mongolia by Nakamaru Shintaro failed last year, it has never slackened its work on spying on Mongolia. In February of this year, the Japanese army again invaded Mongolia. However, Mongolia is located in a remote border area, and news is scarce, so the Chinese people have not heard the details of the incident for several months. It has been investigated that the leader of this invasion of Mongolia was Colonel Matsui Seisuke. Matsui was 55 years old. Six years ago, he was the artillery commander of the Japanese 9th Division. Afterwards, he resigned and served exclusively as an army detective spying on Mongolia. Because he is the maternal uncle of Kawashima Yoshiko (daughter of Prince Gong), he has always been in contact with the princes and leaders of various Mongolian banners. In recent years, he has traveled between Qinghai and Shenyang a total of three times and is a famous Mongolian expert in Japan. When Zhang Zuolin was alive, he served as an advisor to the Marshal's Mansion. After the September 18th Incident last year, he recruited hundreds of bandits in Tongliao and other places to form an army to enter Mongolia, appointing three army commanders and calling himself commander-in-chief, under the control of the Japanese Kwantung Army stationed in Shenyang. The Kwantung Army also provided them with weapons and ammunition. Matsui then advanced step by step into Mongolia. On February 25, they arrived at Linxi County, which belonged to Rehe Province. The Chinese army stationed there actually opened the city and welcomed them with flags. On March 1, they advanced to the Gejiayingzi area, which belonged to Mongolia, when suddenly more than a thousand cavalrymen without flags surrounded Matsui and his subordinates completely. Hundreds of rabble soldiers, along with Matsui and Major Iwai, were all killed. The only one who escaped back to Shenyang was the secretary-general, the traitor Wu Huamin. After Honjo Shigeru received the news, he immediately sent airplanes to Inner Mongolia to demonstrate. According to Wu's account, Matsui's warhorse was shot and killed first during the battle, and then his waist was seriously injured in three places, and he died immediately. Matsui's purpose in entering Mongolia was to incite the independent movement of the Mongolian princes and leaders, so that they could break away from China and form the same situation as the Northeast puppet state.</p>

<p>Tan Qixiu's Recruitment Achieves Great Success</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Wu Song Fortress Commander Tan Qixiu, since returning to Guangdong, has been actively recruiting supplementary soldiers, preparing for a long-term resistance against Japan. It is reported that Tan plans to first establish a supplementary brigade with the recruited soldiers in Guangdong. Sons and daughters of Guangdong, for the sake of resisting Japan, are all enthusiastically enlisting in the army and sacrificing for the country. The recruitment method involves sending personnel to various subordinate districts to conduct recruitment. Li Jinbo was dispatched to Luoding, Zheng Xingcha to Xinxing and Liangyang, Chen Renyuan to Gaolei, Sun Lanquan to Qinlian, and Zhu Zichao to the five districts of Yulin, Guangxi. After each officer arrived at their destination, the number of enlistees had already reached several thousand. Tan immediately appointed the commanders of each regiment of the supplementary brigade. It is found that Chen Renzhi is the commander of the first regiment, Sun Lanquan is the commander of the second regiment, Xie Zidong is the commander of the third regiment, Zheng Xingcha is the commander of the fourth regiment, and Li Jinbo is the commander of the independent regiment. Those who have already been recruited are issued firearms and training begins. A new recruit training center has been established in Hekou, Sanshui, to concentrate and train new recruits from the Xijiang and Guangxi areas. On the Beijiang side, a brigade headquarters has been established at the Xinjie Station on the Yuehan Railway, and a new recruit transportation office has been established in Huangsha, the provincial capital, and Xu Ji has been appointed to preside over recruitment affairs in Beijiang. Xu Ji was a brigade commander under Xu Chongzhi in the past and has a considerable history in the revolution. This time, he is serving Tan, and most of the soldiers he recruits are also former subordinates of Xu. Currently, the 19th Route Army Headquarters has dispatched more than 20 officers to Guangdong to take charge of the training of new recruits. On the South Road side, the recently recruited new recruits and a portion transferred from Chen Ce's Marine Corps will first form a special service battalion, according to the Class A infantry formation of the army. The battalion is fully staffed with five companies and has received firearms from the 19th Route Army rear office. It is concentrating training in Beihai. On the Guangxi side, recruitment is proceeding with the support of the Guangxi authorities. A regiment of unarmed soldiers of the former subordinates of Hu Ruoping has been recruited, as well as a regiment of unarmed Guizhou soldiers of the former subordinates of Situ Fei. Both regiments have arrived at Hekou, Sanshui and are being concentrated at the new recruit training center.</p>
<p>Firearms will be issued and they will be slightly organized, then they can go to the front lines, because the able-bodied youths of both regiments have long been trained. (April 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Investigation Team Reports on Situation from Western Nanjing (7) <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Appendix: League of Nations Handling of Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>Although our country's consistent demand for a deadline for troop withdrawal was abandoned due to opposition from all parties, we still advocate that the future draft resolution should stipulate: (1) The investigation team should have the power to supervise troop withdrawal; (2) When the team arrives at its destination, it should report to the Administrative Yuan on whether Japan has implemented troop withdrawal in accordance with the resolution. Japan, on the other hand, advocates: (1) The investigation team has no right to interfere in the military affairs of both parties; (2) The team should go to the Chinese interior to investigate the situation of boycotting Japanese goods; (3) When the team arrives at the destination, it cannot issue a report proving that Japanese troops have not withdrawn, in order to avoid indirect stipulations for a troop withdrawal deadline; (4) Japan has the right to suppress bandits in the Eastern Provinces.</p>
<p>Among the four points advocated by Japan, the fourth point is the most barbaric and unreasonable, because the right to suppress bandits is the sovereignty of an independent country. Moreover, using bandit suppression as a pretext to advance troops is a common trick of Japan. Now Japan actually asks the Administrative Yuan to grant it the right to suppress bandits in the Eastern Provinces, even the numb and insensitive Administrative Yuan is disgusted by this and therefore flatly refuses. As for the remaining points, after modifying the wording, those agreed to by both parties are retained, and the irreconcilable points are resolved through compromise, with the chairman issuing a separate declaration. Readers will understand when they reach the summary of the resolution and the chairman's declaration.</p>
<p>(3) Meetings on December 9th and 10th and the Situation After the Meetings On December 9th, the Administrative Yuan reconvened a public meeting, and the chairman submitted the draft resolution of the Administrative Yuan and the draft declaration of the chairman for discussion. There were no objections. The chairman asked the Chinese and Japanese representatives to telegram their respective governments for approval. By the next day, December 10th, the Chinese and Japanese representatives had received replies from their respective countries. The chairman then convened a public meeting and submitted the two drafts for a vote. As a result, they were unanimously passed. Before the resolution was submitted for a vote, Briand consulted with the US representative General Stimson and obtained his agreement.</p>
<p>After the resolution was passed, the Japanese representative spoke, saying that Japan supported the draft resolution, but on the condition that it reserved the right to suppress bandits and other troublemakers. The Chinese representative also declared: (1) Reserving all rights granted by international treaties; (2) China recognizes that the chairman's declaration contains the following four principles: (1) Immediately cease military actions; (2) Clear up Japan's occupation of Manchuria within the shortest possible time; (3) All future situations should be continuously reported to the League of Nations by neutral parties; (4) The Administrative Yuan should appoint an investigation team to study the entire situation in Manchuria on the spot. The above four principles are interrelated. Violating one is enough to destroy the others. (3) When the investigation team arrives in Manchuria, if Japanese troops have not withdrawn, the team should immediately report to the League of Nations, and the report should include recommendations. (4) China's right to demand compensation for losses from Japan is not lost due to the current resolution's failure to explicitly stipulate it. (5) Japan cannot use the pretext of unrest in the Eastern Provinces to redeploy troops in the future, because the unrestful environment was created by Japan's use of troops. China absolutely does not recognize the right of foreigners to occupy Chinese territory and maintain law and order on its behalf. (6) The Chinese government may invite neutral personnel to investigate the truth in places designated by it at any time. (7) China's long-standing opposition to the principle of foreign troops stationed on its territory should not be abandoned due to the current resolution. (8) China believes that if Japan creates an independence movement in the Eastern Provinces that harms its territorial and administrative integrity, it will be in violation of the League of Nations resolution.</p>
<p>The British representative stated that although Japan's autonomous bandit suppression is an unavoidable fact, once the original state is restored, this special action should be stopped immediately.</p>
<p>Representatives from other countries also spoke, roughly saying that the Sino-Japanese dispute has been going on for several months, and the current resolution is not a thorough solution, but because the nature of the Manchurian problem is special, its solution should not be a precedent for future international disputes. Representatives from small and weak countries in South America gave even more heartfelt speeches. China's representative Shi also stated that the representatives of various countries clearly know that they are weak and lack courage and dare not resist the violent Japan, and they are also afraid that in future international disputes, someone will follow this precedent and "invite public entry into the urn." Therefore, he specifically declared the special nature of this Sino-Japanese dispute and angrily said in a stern tone that the Chinese government absolutely does not recognize that the effect of international law can only extend to the borders of Manchuria. The conference, which lasted for more than twenty days, thus came to a temporary end.</p>
<p>(4) Study of the Resolution and the Chairman's Declaration The content of the resolution is divided into six items: (1) The Administrative Yuan hereby reiterates the resolution unanimously passed on September 30th. Both China and Japan have the obligation to comply with it. Therefore, we ask the governments of China and Japan to earnestly fulfill it and ensure that Japanese troops withdraw to within the South Manchuria Railway line under the conditions stipulated in the resolution within the shortest possible time. (2) The situation that has occurred since the adjournment of the Administrative Yuan on October 24th has become more serious. Both parties have now agreed to find ways to avoid escalation and to exercise self-restraint to avoid the recurrence of wars and casualties. (3) Please both parties continue to report the latest situation to the Administrative Yuan at any time.

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>The Shanghai war has given us the most profound stimulus. It is the violence displayed by the air force. Therefore, everyone feels that in the near future, China's "expansion of the air force" is something that can no longer be delayed. Although China's air force is very immature, I believe that if the Northeast planes had not been seized by the violent Japanese, and if the strength of the national air force had been concentrated to resist Japan, the enemy planes would not have been so rampant. The Shanghai area would not have been ravaged so tragically. Furthermore, how could there have been such an alarming loss of 140,000,000 yuan?</p>
<p>Recently, Director Zhang Hui visited Beijing. It is said that it is related to the issue of forming an air force. He has drafted a "Three-Year Air Force Plan," dividing it into three aviation zones: Beiping, Nanjing, and Guangzhou. It is expected that each zone will train 100 fighter planes in the first year, 300 in the second year, and 500 in the third year. Each zone will also set up a factory to manufacture engines. I hope that this great plan can be realized with the strength of the people of the whole country. The implementation of donating three planes per county and one plane per small county in Guangdong Province is especially hoped that the government will issue an order throughout the country and implement it on schedule. With the greatest determination, the greatest success will be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Seven Women of the Skull Squad <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yan Ye</p>
<p>The Skull Squad comes from the north. Vowing to wipe out the barbarians, they do not wish to return alive. The squad has a total of more than eighty members. Upon arriving in Zhengyi, they joined under Commander Qu Shounian of the 19th Route Army. They earnestly requested to work on the front lines. Commander Qu was moved by their sincerity and agreed. Among the squad members are seven women, all young. They are beautiful in appearance and their clothing is extremely fashionable, truly so-called modern people. Commander Qu, pitying their weak and isolated nature, instructed them to serve in the rear, in order to reduce their hardship. The seven women said, "Commander's kindness is greatly appreciated, but we do not wish to accept it. Although we are women, we truly do not wish to be subordinate to men. We are also confident in our abilities, which are no less than those of men. Commander's move is discrimination against men and women. We have decided to go to the front with the male squad members and to share the same hardships with the male squad members. If one day our performance is not as good as the men's, then Commander may transfer us to the rear or even punish or execute us for poor performance. At that time, we will vow not to accept the order." Commander Qu was greatly moved upon hearing this and immediately granted their request. After the entire squad arrived at the front lines, they engaged in the construction of defensive works. The seven women worked with their own hands, regardless of wind or rain. Their physical strength and diligence were no less than those of the men. Their work performance was not only not inferior, but perhaps even exceeded it. The ladies slept in the sand every day and night. They had already dedicated themselves to the country, so they had no time to tidy up their clothes or wish to preserve their beauty. To this day, they all have bare heads and feet, and have exchanged their cheongsams for battle robes. The matter was reported to Shanghai yesterday by a gentleman who served on the front lines. When asked about the names of the ladies, he said that he did not know. It is truly a regrettable matter that they cannot be individually recognized.</p>

<p>— Ziwei</p>
<p>The violent Japanese invade, inhumanely. Zhabei and Wusong are a scene of ruins. The Mingxing Film Company has produced a film of the actual battlefield. Everything, from the cruel traces of the Japanese army to the suffering of our people, has been collected one by one, in great detail, without omission. When filming, Japanese planes followed and dropped bombs. In the end, they were able to overcome difficulties and dangers to make this great film. Its preciousness can be known. The National Government has ordered a copy to be sent to the League of Nations, in order to publicize the barbarity of the violent Japanese to the world. Cunning as the Japanese are, they will probably not be able to cover it up again.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the month, the League of Nations investigation commissioners visited Beijing. Zhang Shichuan and several technicians traveled to Nanjing. At the reception at the Lishi Society, they shot many sound films. On the way back, they passed through Wumen and stayed outside Jinchaomen. Through the introduction of Brigade Commander Weng, they specially went to Taicang, Kunshan, Qingyanggang and other places to film the military life of our 19th Route Army. All the commanders, including Cai Tingkai, were filmed.</p>
<p>The entire trip lasted two weeks. Every day they worked on the front lines. They have all returned to Shanghai, and their faces are dark and their beards are disheveled due to the wind and frost. It is said that when filming, enemy reconnaissance planes often came to the position and circled around. Our 19th Route Army stood ready, full of spirit. They did not slacken in the slightest in their defensive works. This can be used to comfort the people of the country. It is said that the sound film is already being printed. Those who are concerned about the front lines will soon be able to see our loyal and brave 19th Route Army again.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Shanghai War and Military Weapons (12) <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>In 1914, the World War broke out. The British army relied on tanks to win. However, at that time, they were only heavy vehicles of 15 to 20 tons, light vehicles of 5 to 10 tons, and 3-ton bean tanks for auxiliary use. With the development of technology, large tanks of 40 tons or more and 80 tons or less appeared. The armor ranged from 15 to 30 hao. The speed ranged from 30 to 50 kilometers. They were equipped with machine guns and light and heavy cannons. In the Battle of the Somme in 1916, the British army again relied on the power of tanks to repeatedly break through German positions. Thus, another epoch-making progress was made. Now, they have been changed to six-wheeled and tracked types. The maximum speed has reached 80 kilometers. They can be equipped with four machine guns. It is said that in the German army today, one battalion has 30 tanks. Last month, the United States invented a new amphibious light tank. The structure and equipment are even more exquisite. Because the tanks used in the past could only travel on land, and would sink when encountering loose, soft, or wet mud and sand, the amphibious vehicles can avoid all kinds of drawbacks.</p>
<p>Japanese tanks were manufactured after the World War, based on the British government's gift of female tanks as a standard. In recent years, the output has gradually increased. The ones sent to the Shanghai war this time are the country's only independent Kurume tank unit. They are all Japanese-made Type 89 tanks. They are equipped with Type 89 fighter planes. However, their armament, speed, and destructive power are also very strong. When fighting in Zhabei and Jiangwan, they were quite active in reconnaissance, combat, and heavy bombing. However, many of them were destroyed by our army's landmines. This point is also admitted by their Japanese newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Heroic Death (Middle) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>A heroic and glorious battle began on the misty morning of the third day after the Old Zhao's team arrived in Jiangwan.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, we've been here for two days, why haven't the short devils come? Why are they only attacking Zhabei? It's extremely hateful. Don't they want to try a new flavor? Are they looking down on us? Sigh, when we want them to come, they refuse to come. Could it be that Old Zhao's reputation has startled them? Haha, short devils, short devils, come on, what the hell are you waiting for!" Old Zhao said hatefully, smoking a cigarette.</p>
<p>"Old Zhao, stop chattering. Look, aren't they coming?" Old Zhang pulled Old Zhao's clothes, telling him to look at the line of things in the distance that looked the same crawling towards them in the dim light.</p>
<p>"What are those things? Old Zhang, they look like turtles." Old Zhao said, grabbing his cigarette and preparing his weapons, asking Old Zhang.</p>
<p>"Tanks." Old Zhang also aimed his gun at the enemy.</p>
<p>"How novel!... Ah, they're getting closer!... They're getting closer!"</p>
<p>When the officer gave the order to fire, the enemy's bullets were already flying over like raindrops. The enemy got closer and closer. Our brave warriors, without waiting for the officer's charge command, had already jumped out of the trenches and charged towards the enemy. How did these hot-blooded warriors make the enemy panic? Their bayonets, their bullets, their courage, their tactics, their actions, every performance of the battle, could threaten the enemy, letting them know that our warriors were so inviolable. The enemy could not help but retreat. The enemy could not help but find a safe place to protect their lives.</p>
<p>"Ha, the enemy has turned their backs on us! How satisfying, Old Zhang, we've really killed them to our heart's content today! Kill! Kill!... Kill!"</p>
<p>After a dense burst of gunfire and heroic shouts, dozens more enemies fell to the ground. After they repelled the enemy, they obeyed the officer's orders and returned to the trenches to defend. At this time, it was already bright. The sun still shone as usual, as if this cruel act on the earth had nothing to do with him.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, you didn't lie to me. The short devils are indeed easier to fight than bandits! I've fought for eight years, and I've never fought so satisfyingly as today!"</p>
<p>Old Zhao shouted alone for a long time, but no one paid attention to him. He sulked in the trenches, looking at the clouds in the sky in a daze. The white smoke he exhaled from his mouth danced before his eyes, transforming into a symbol of killing even more satisfyingly than this time; the smile he held on his lips indicated that he had already obtained better and more satisfying tactics.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Financial: Last Week Gold Market Still Advancing <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The market was very brisk in the first half of the week. Last week, the bidding gold price rose frequently. It was high from the beginning of the week, reaching a high price of 701.8 taels. Afterwards, the silver market repeatedly reported contractions, so it went forward bravely and a peak of 727 taels, the highest this year, appeared. However, there were ups and downs from time to time, but there were no special changes. The daily fluctuations were within 10 taels. By the weekend, it subsided again, probably because the current situation had an impact, and it retreated to the border of 710 taels. That day happened to be the rollover day. The short side posted it, first for 5 taels, then for 6.5 taels, and then for 4 taels, because the cash reserve was exhausted, so it was under pressure from all sides. In May, there was a review of 25.1 taels, and the total increase was 8.1 taels, so June was lower by 4 or 5 taels. The British-American exchange rate rose first and then fell, so the Shanghai market drafts were loose on the British side and tight on the American side. All the brokers bought and then sold. Now the British gold is slightly more bullish, while the American gold is still short-term. Most hedgers, if calculated according to the closing price of the American gold, deducted about 60 taels. Almost since the beginning of the week, several hundred bars of cash have been opened by the Central Bank, but later, because the price was not suitable, the industry was unwilling to sell it. Also, it was found that in recent days, there were many other star shorts in the exchange, as was the case with the Dalian gang, but the number of bars was limited, and spot firms and the Guangdong gang were all on the long side. Now, the past situation of the week is recorded again for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e113">A Sketch of the Entire Week's Process <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Since Monday (April 11), the large gold bar still contracted 1.25, the American silver contracted 1.25, the first order was not changed, and the American gold increased by 1.25, because the exchange rate was high. The same was true for the domestic market. The industry bought near-term contracts. The gold price in May initially opened at 708.5 taels, then added 5.3 qian, followed by 0.9 taels. Afterwards, there were more sales, and it retreated to 0.2 taels, followed by fluctuations of 2 or 3 taels. It closed in the morning at 0.39 qian, and 0.4 taels in the afternoon. The market opened and then large households sold, starting at 0.18 qian. The Central Bank opened 400 or 500 bars of cash, and the price rose to 0.52 qian. When it closed, it retreated to 0.29 qian, a decrease of 3 qian from the previous Saturday. The entire day saw a fluctuation of 7.2 qian. The Dalian gang sold short positions, and the Guangdong gang and spot firms bought to offset the sold spots.</p>
<p>(Tuesday) Large gold bar and silver price each increased by 1.15, and the British and American exchange rates were stable. However, the industry was still relentlessly buying American gold. The gold market initially opened flat, slightly adding 1 qian, to 703 taels. Because there were buyers on the ground who were content, the market stabilized. Afterwards, it rotated upwards. Speculator Wu and large households bought, actually reaching 710 taels, at 12.5 taels. It closed in the morning at 0.92 qian. In the afternoon, it opened at 0.9 taels, followed by 10 taels, and then fluctuations of 1 or 2 taels. The Central Bank opened another 175 bars, but the sellers were not idle, and it retreated to 0.76 qian. When it closed, it was 0.87 qian, an increase of 5.8 qian from the previous day. The entire day saw an ebb and flow of 9.5 taels.</p>
<p>(Wednesday) British silver contracted 1.25, American silver contracted 0.25, the Shanghai market was flat on the British side and strong on the American side. Then, because the listing was changed to a smaller range, the first order was 0.25, and the American gold was 0.375, so the domestic market was also tight. Various firms struggled to buy, but Citibank sold. The bidding gold price initially opened and added 3.3 qian, to 712 taels, followed by 13.5 taels to 11.5 taels. Afterwards, as the exchange market tightened, it gradually rose, reaching 19.1 qian. It closed in the morning at 18.6 qian. The market opened in the afternoon at 18.8 qian. The buyers showed courage and broke through 20 taels, followed by a close at 23 taels, a continued increase of 14.3 qian from the previous day. The entire day saw a review of 11.5 taels. As the rollover day approached, the short side urgently covered.</p>
<p>(Thursday) Large gold bar contracted 1.875, American silver contracted 0.25, but the listing of the exchange market did not change. The domestic market was loose on the British side and firm on the American side. This was because the exchange rate was small. The gold market opened at 723 taels. However, the large gold bar contracted slightly too much. Fortunately, the ground was still good, and it was able to stabilize. Afterwards, large households excitedly competed to buy, and the American gold became even stronger, reaching a peak of 27 taels. However, Wu and various firms took the opportunity to sell, and the trend turned sharply downwards. It closed in the morning at 21.9 qian. In the afternoon, it was 21.5 qian. Afterwards, rumors spread, and it fell to 19.5 taels. Later, because the printed exchange rate was small, it saw a high rise. When it closed, it was 23.2 qian, an increase of only 2 qian from the previous day. The entire day saw a difference of 7.5 taels.</p>
<p>(Friday) The British and American silver markets each contracted 1.25, the first order increased 1.25, and the American gold also increased 1.25, so the exchange rate was slightly smaller and not affected. Also, according to the report on the ground, the United States had a saying about maintaining the silver price, so the domestic market was also loose. The gold market initially opened and decreased by 3.2 qian, to 720 taels. Later, Reuters reported that Germany had bought a large batch of cash silver to mint silver coins, totaling about 100 million marks, so the market went downstream and reduced more than 4 taels, to 15.8 qian. Later, it increased to 20.5 qian. It closed in the morning at 19.5 qian. In the afternoon, it was 18.8 qian. The market closed at 18 taels, a decrease of 5.2 qian from the previous day. The entire day saw 5.4 qian. The upward and downward situation was still flat.</p>
<p>(Saturday) Large gold bar increased 1.875, American silver increased 3.75, British and American exchange rates each increased 1.25, and the domestic market was also insufficient. As the bidding gold price coincided with the rollover day, there were no transactions in May. The opening price was 718 taels, and it closed at 11.3 qian. The first day of June opened at 712.5 taels, and then there were slight changes. It had reached 15.2 qian. At 11 o'clock, news of the tense situation between Japan and Russia and Japan and the United States was suddenly heard, and the market went down, dropping 8 taels. The situation suddenly deteriorated. It closed in the morning at 0.73 qian. However, there were not many transactions on the rollover day. In half a day, there was also a review of 7.9 qian. The high and low prices of British and American silver prices and exchange drafts are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Week of Silence in the Money Market <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, being Sunday, banks were closed as usual, and there was no news to report. The market was also particularly quiet. Because both supply and demand for "li" were weak, there was no significant fluctuation. It was only slightly better than the previous day by 0.125 "hao", reaching 7 "qian" 02 "li" 2.5 "hao". The morning and afternoon markets were the same. Outward remittances made were 145,000 in the morning and 340,000 in the afternoon. No transactions were recorded for banknotes in both markets. The silver loan market was even more relaxed, with the price dropping sharply by 0.05 "qian", calculated at 0.1 "qian", the same in the morning and afternoon. Transactions of loan tickets exceeded 1.5 million. The money shops received over 2.5 million in silver and foreign public bills, over 21 million in silver public bills, and over 200,000 in small money shops. The morning price for Jiangnan small silver dollars was 6 "qian" 09 "li", and the afternoon price was 6 "qian" 08 "li". The result was a decrease of 0.02 "li" compared to the previous day. Trading volume was 3,000 "jiao" in the morning and 1,000 "jiao" in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver dollars were priced at 6 "qian" 1 "fen" 0.5 "li" in the morning and 6 "qian" 1 "fen" 1.5 "li" in the afternoon. Trading volume was 55,000 "jiao" in the morning and 15,000 "jiao" in the afternoon. Copper coins increased by 1,000 "wen", still at a high level of 417,000 "wen", with high transaction volume, estimated at around 40,000 strings.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Tea Merchants Prepare Funds for Departure <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>As the Grain Rain solar term approaches, new tea from tea-producing areas is gradually appearing on the market. The main outlet depends on tea merchants in Shanghai for procurement. This year, due to the impact of the current situation on the financial sector, loans are not easily granted, causing tea merchants to hesitate. While they are trying to raise funds, the amount is ultimately limited and insufficient to meet the fixed amount for procurement. According to investigations, several reputable tea firms, such as Company A, B, and C, are raising funds through their own resources and financial accommodations to gather a large sum of cash for their scheduled departure to purchase tea. Other tea merchants are mostly waiting passively, hoping for assistance from various parties. It is said that due to fewer purchases this year, prices in the tea-producing regions have dropped sharply, making profits potentially attractive.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Yarn and Cotton Sales Remain Stagnant with No Turnaround <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Last week, yarn prices continued to decline.</p>
<p>Cotton yarn sales remained sluggish last week. Dealers showed no enthusiasm. The suspension of peace talks dampened morale, and the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates caused the Shanghai yarn price, which is usually based on silver dollars, to effectively increase by 8 or 9 yuan per piece when sold inland in foreign currency terms. This severely impacted yarn sales. The Yangtze River market was lifeless, with only sporadic transactions in South China. As a result, the yarn market continued to decline this week. Factories have accumulated large stocks of yarn, leading to a drastic drop in selling prices. Based on actual assessments, the future situation is quite worrying. Statistics show that only 2,770 bales were purchased by all groups throughout the week, including 472 bales by fellow traders. The market price fell by 20-30 taels. 42-count "Ren Zhong" yarn fell by 10 taels, which can be considered a significant drop. The volume of purchases by each group is listed below:</p>
<p>Group  Bales  Group  Bales  Group  Bales</p>
<p>Guangdong  330  Ningbo  20  Inland  191</p>
<p>Sichuan  835  Jiangxi  65  Fujian  15</p>

<p>Last week, Shenxin's cotton purchases were active.</p>
<p>The cotton market remained weak this week, but the transaction volume was large. Due to the unfavorable overall situation and the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, domestic prices were lower when calculated in silver dollars, as inland sales are priced in foreign currency. Additionally, sluggish yarn sales led to a sluggish attitude among factories. However, Shenxin finalized its foreign cotton prices and purchased domestic cotton to offset the difference, making its purchases particularly active. American cotton rose by 10 "bang yin" compared to the previous week. The volume of sales is listed below:</p>
<p>Tianjin Cotton 34.50  274 pieces  Spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 33.75  33.25  5,600 bales  Spot delivery to warehouse</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 36.50  35.50  1,400 pieces  Spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Shandong American Cotton 35.00  34.75  1,300 pieces  Spot delivery to factory</p>

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton futures fell by 5 to 8 "bang yin" due to weakness on Wall Street, profit-taking by bulls, and reduced buying interest. Spot prices fell by 10 "bang yin". British cotton futures fell by 45 points, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points. Indian cotton weakened due to selling by speculators and brokers, with "Ping Guo Er" falling by 4 rupees and "Bai Luo Xi" falling by 3.5 rupees.

<h3 id="e120">General Situation of Yarn and Cotton in Shanghai in March <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices Fall Sharply The cotton yarn market in March was relatively stable. Due to the suspension of operations by Japanese factories and the inability of Chinese factories to operate at full capacity, production significantly decreased, and market sentiment was somewhat firm. However, from the middle of the month, actual demand became extremely sluggish, and various groups showed no enthusiasm. The reasons for this are attributed to the financial exhaustion and transportation disruptions following the outbreak of the Shanghai War, as well as the severe impact of last year's floods. Moreover, the economic difficulties caused by the war in the inland areas are beyond description, all of which have dealt a significant blow to the yarn market. In previous years, there should have been a period of strong sales during the spring season, but the current situation is hopeless. As a result, morale has declined, and factories' inventories have increased daily, leading to a sharp decline in the market. The situation was particularly severe in the latter half of the month, with 42-count yarn falling by as much as 20 taels and 20-count yarn falling by over 10 taels. Coarse yarn saw less of a decline. Statistics show that actual sales this month were only 8,520 bales, with Guangdong accounting for the most at 2,447 bales, followed by Sichuan at 1,510 bales, Jiangxi at 583 bales, and inland areas at 631 bales. Other transactions were only sporadic. The volume of purchases by each group is listed below:</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Demand Remains Sluggish The cotton market is flat, and factory demand remains sluggish due to weak yarn sales, tight credit conditions, and the overall decline in the global cotton industry. As a result, business is quiet. However, due to transportation difficulties, supply from other regions is limited. Shenxin Factory finalized its prices for a portion of American cotton at the highest peak and purchased domestic cotton to offset the difference, making its purchases relatively active. Total transactions for the month were 5,080 pieces and 11,000 bales, totaling 300,980 dan. The transaction volume for March is listed below:</p>
<p>Huo Ji Cotton 54.25 52.40 10,700 bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<h3 id="e121">Grain and Rice Market: High Prices Initially, then Softening <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, supplies from various groups continued to arrive, with a slight increase in inventory in Pudong, totaling about 80 companies, mostly "Guan Ju". However, buyers were unwilling to select them, and the top-grade materials softened slightly, while ordinary materials were more sluggish. The situation was initially high-priced but then softened. A small amount of early rice arrived, especially the "Er Tong", "Kang A Hai", "Xia Zhang Sheng" varieties, totaling 400 "shi", and all were sold out during the day. "Zhong Guan" was sluggish, with no upward or downward movement. Several dozen "shi" of "Yang Du Jian" were bought, and the market fell by 0.1-0.2 yuan. The situation was flexible and sales were made upon arrival, with no rise or fall in price.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, 30-40 cargoes arrived along the Suzhou River. Transactions on this street were sluggish, and the decline in prices was similar to that in the South Market. Kunshan and Jiangyin rice saw a shortage of 0.1 yuan, and top-quality goods were particularly scarce. The arrival of Suzhou and Changzhou "Bai Geng" was limited, and the opening prices were fixed. Qingpu thin rice from rural villages had some outlets, and prices rose by 0.1 yuan. "Bian Yin Yuan" and "Lu Yang Jian" remained unchanged. River factories sold 2,000-3,000 "shi" of various goods.</p>

<p>Overseas Markets See New Low Prices... Chinese Silk Merchants Face Difficulty Selling</p>
<p>The silk market, both domestic and international, was extremely weak last week. In New York, due to the boycott of Japanese goods, Japanese silk was aggressively sold at low prices, leading to new lows for both Chinese and Japanese silk, with prices falling by 0.2-0.45 US dollars per pound. In Lyon, spring sales of silk fabrics remained sluggish, inventories were high, and summer fabrics increasingly used rayon, significantly reducing the demand for raw silk. Furthermore, a large amount of Japanese silk was imported before the tax increase, resulting in strong inventories. Silk prices gradually declined, with both Chinese and Japanese silk falling by 4-5 francs per kilogram. In London, silk sales were sluggish, and printed silk for lower garments remained unsold. Due to the tense exchange rate with England, both Chinese and Japanese silk fell by 2-3 pence per pound. Shanghai's Chinese silk merchants hold inventory with high costs: white silk factories need to sell for over 1,000 taels, while overseas telegram prices for New York B-grade 80% evenness are less than 500 taels in Chinese silver, and London and Lyon AB-grade 13-15 filaments are only over 700 taels. Factories would lose 300-400 taels per bale, so they insist on not selling. Sales of Sichuan dry silk to Europe were also sluggish, while yellow and white coarse silk sales to India were not quiet. Only 300 bales of spot silk were transacted last week, with exports of just over 200 bales. The list of overseas market prices for Chinese silk at the end of last week is as follows:</p>
<p>(New York: Price per pound in US dollars; Lyon: Price per kilogram in francs)</p>

<p>Spot Transactions Predominate in Woolen Fabrics</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics have been trading actively recently, with demand from various groups. However, large wholesale transactions remain limited. Sellers generally require spot transactions with tickets, otherwise they prefer not to sell. They are willing to make concessions on prices. In recent days, except for long-term customers, spot transactions are required for all quantities, whether half a bolt or a full bolt. As a result, street brokers find it difficult to solicit business, and buyers are also cautious, unlike previous years when they could arbitrarily allocate various goods.</p>

<p>New shipments of American galvanized iron arrived yesterday, totaling several thousand "dan", further filling the Shanghai market. The market is under pressure from an unfavorable environment and continues to decline. Currently, 48-gauge is selling for 15.5 taels per "dan", 38-gauge for 15.6 taels, 33-gauge for 14.5 taels, and 25-gauge for 13.75 taels. It is reported that for large transactions, prices may be slightly cheaper. It is said that besides shipments of 40-50 "dan" by customer groups in recent days, there has been little interest from other groups.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of pig lead rebounded because industry peers discussed ways to maintain prices due to cutthroat competition. Therefore, it was agreed to increase the price by 0.025 taels, to 14.25 taels per "dan". Transactions with tea merchants continued to be brisk, and businesses from Tianjin and Hankou also saw some activity. However, business on this street remained sluggish.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Do Not Go to Zhabei <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Bao (Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury) reports, "The Chinese political organization under Japanese control in Zhabei, which appeared on April 1st, was dissolved by order of the Japanese naval authorities on April 11th, but reappeared today (16th). However, the leading figures are no longer the same."</p>
<p>Upon seeing this news, I took a deep breath of cold air. Although the old traitors have been disbanded, new puppets have emerged. I believe that this is the same old trick, just repeated. I initially wanted to pick up my pen and scold them thoroughly, but after thinking about it, I realized it was unnecessary, because there are so many traitors, they are beyond scolding. Moreover, since they are traitors, the national laws will punish them, and the universal principles of humanity will condemn them. These brainless, heartless creatures are only "three parts human, seven parts beast." It is not worth defiling my writing to harshly scold them.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, my proposal is a new slogan: "Do Not Go to Zhabei" in five big characters. Because ordinary people should not go to Zhabei. Once they go, they will inevitably be subjected to the commands, restrictions, extortion, and coercion of the traitors. I ask, are we, the good people, willing to be maintained and protected by a pack of foxes and dogs? Therefore, my saying "Do Not Go to Zhabei" means that I advise everyone:</p>
<p>Those who want to live, do not live in Zhabei. Those who want to do business, do not do business in Zhabei. Those who want to travel, do not travel in Zhabei.</p>
<p>In short, before the Japanese soldiers have completely withdrawn, do not go to Zhabei. Do not look at the hideous faces of the Japanese people. Do not look at the pretenses of the traitors. Food, clothing, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of human life. Originally, the national character of "settling down and valuing one's native land" made it difficult for the people who were used to living in Zhabei to move easily. Fortunately, after this military disaster, houses and property were mostly destroyed by artillery fire, and 70-80% of the residents have already moved. Now, the area has become a region of ghosts crying, gods wailing, and jackals and wolves roaming. Going there would inevitably stir up emotions and send shivers down one's spine.</p>
<p>Another point is that most of the people living in Zhabei are living under someone else's roof, and very few own their own property. If one is going to live under someone else's roof anyway, why must one settle in Zhabei? This approach, I believe, is very appropriate. The purpose of their maintenance association is first to maintain the enemy, and second to maintain themselves. As for maintaining the local area, I am afraid that they will never be able to do that. Only "Do Not Go to Zhabei" is the best and most appropriate solution.</p>

<p>Presenting the Military Map</p>
<p>Presenting the military map, selling Spring Shen, who is that person? A close relative in the imperial harem. Once the military map is presented, military intelligence is leaked. Thirty days of effort are abandoned in a single day. The country is ashamed to have such a person. All our soldiers and civilians point fingers. Why is it that he was arrested more than a month ago, and we have not heard whether the crime has been determined? If the crime is truly undeniable, it must be punished by national law and military law. If the accusation is false, then the suspicions of the public should be dispelled as soon as possible. Alas, there are hundreds or thousands of people who betray the country, but why am I blamed for merely presenting a military map? Do you not see the general guarding Liaodong lost territory, yet still has a mighty army under his command?</p>
<p>Dancing Craze</p>
<p>Ten thousand lights flicker in the shadows on the mirror screen. Dew dampens the streets, a jade expanse. The curtains are raised in all twelve jade pavilions. Sounds of Ziyun melodies fly out. The wind blows the silk sleeves, ascending the silver stage. Dragon flutes and phoenix pipes resound like thunder. Countless figures embrace the moon, drifting like smoke. Following the sound, the clogs can tread thousands of times. Among them, there are many fairies on Penglai. Red gauze veils their skin, a mere foot away. The shattered homeland is not discussed. Life is only fit to die in a gentle land. After the single silk dance, champagne is poured. Wine-soaked words tease the flowers, but the flowers do not resent. The silver moon is about to set, but the revelry has not stopped. Butterflies dream, still not awake. The ashes of Kunming Pond stretch ten thousand fathoms deep. Why still revel on the flower pond with such a heart?</p>

<h3 id="e128">Advertising Lights <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Wei</p>
<p>At dusk, on the bustling Nanjing Road, we can see red, green, vivid, and beautiful lights emanating from the windows on both sides, displaying graphic trademarks and store names, which are very dazzling. These advertising lights really attract attention.</p>
<p>This light is called "Neon-Sign Light" in English, and we can translate it as "Neon Light". It has been changed from the "Mercury Arc Lamp", so many people call it "Mercury Lamp". It has a very short history, just like a little baby who has not yet completed a season since birth, but it is so vividly cute that shop owners are willing to spend more money to invite it to live in the glass window all day long, attracting a group of buyers.</p>
<p>The mercury arc lamp, also called the Cooper-Hewitt Lamp, is named after its inventor. The manufacturing method of this lamp is to first take a glass tube and soften it in a smokeless fire, and slowly bend it into various patterns or characters, and install it on a black bottom plate. The bottom plate can be made of lead sheet or thin wood. The length of the glass tube is about two feet to four feet. The ordinary thickness is only 7 to 13 millimeters (Millimeter). The two bent openings are placed behind the bottom plate; then the opening at one end is sealed with a metal electrode, and the air in the tube is evacuated with an air pump, so that the tube becomes a vacuum tube (Vacuum Tube). Mercury vapor (Mercury Vapor) is put into the tube, and the unsealed tube opening can also be sealed with a metal electrode. The electricity is connected to the two electrodes at the tube opening, and the current will pass through the mercury vapor, and then emit beautiful light; the colors of the light are green, blue, and yellow, but no matter what, red light can never be emitted. If a tube made of quartz is used instead of a glass tube, it can be turned into a kind of ultraviolet rays (Ultra-violet rays), which is found in sunlight. It can make us healthy and can also disinfect and sterilize. Recently, artificial sun lamps used in hospitals, which can be rented or bought on the market, are of this type, but the form is a bit different.</p>
<p>Later, Sir William Ramsay, a British scientist, analyzed neon from the air, so he took some rarefied neon and put it in instead of mercury gas. After the current passed through, red light was emitted. The red light is emitted by itself, not like the red light emitted by ordinary red glass light bulbs. It has a special ability to pass through smoke and fog, so the lights on airplanes, signal lights on trains and ships, and lights in ocean lighthouses are reliable when using it. If some mercury vapor is mixed into the neon tube, purple and blue light will be emitted. Using a light taupe glass tube will result in a beautiful green light; during the day, we can see light taupe-colored empty glass tubes in the shop windows, and they will probably emit green light in the evening. Speaking of neon, it is a very rare thing, accounting for one ten-thousandth of the volume of air. That is, only one liter can be analyzed from 100,000 liters; therefore, its value is very expensive, and one liter costs more than one hundred dollars. Fortunately, neon lamps do not use much, only a sparse amount.</p>
<p>The electricity passing through the lamp tube must have extremely high voltage, and the longer the lamp tube, the greater the voltage is needed, that is, the applied voltage is directly proportional to the length of the lamp tube. Because the distance between the two electrodes is two feet to four feet, a normal voltage of 220 volts (Volt) will not make it emit light, at least 4,500 volts or more is needed. If we usually connect an advertising lamp to the power supply, we must connect a transformer in the middle to increase the voltage. The current it needs is very small, much less than the electric lights we usually use.</p>
<p>There is also a type that uses helium sealed in the tube, which can be called a helium lamp, which can emit beautiful golden light. It can be seen on the streets of New York, but in Shanghai, they are all red and green. Because helium is even rarer than neon, only two countries in the world can produce it, so the price is much more expensive than neon, and the United States prohibits its export.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of the above three types of advertising lights is that they require high-voltage electricity, so a small advertising lamp also requires a transformer, and the price is slightly lower than a large one, on the glass tube and neon raw materials.</p>
<p>Our old brother can draw out air and bend glass tubes, Shanghai has the Nian Hong Deng Company, etc. that can manufacture various neon advertising lights, which are very delicate, but unfortunately, the raw materials are all purchased from other countries.</p>

<p>— Hongshui</p>
<p>One night, I felt an unusual sense of dullness in the surrounding air—well, 'Let's take a stroll' is what my mind told me: Although it was already past nine o'clock, my wish was finally realized.</p>
<p>Stepping into Zhejiang Road and turning a corner, I arrived at Fourth Avenue: My heart was filled with the hope of relieving my boredom, and I opened my eyes to look around: food, clothing, entertainment, everything was displayed in a lively and bustling manner: it could truly be called a complete street.</p>
<p>In a corner of this street, a crowd of people was gathered, each with a look of terror on their faces; driven by curiosity, I carefully walked over to see what was happening.</p>
<p>There stood two foreign constables and one Chinese constable, all wearing black jackets, each with a pistol hanging from their waist. They were holding onto one of our compatriots who looked like a merchant—the merchant being searched, rummaged like an eagle catching a chick; he suddenly lost his composure and trembled all over! The foreign constable, seeing this expression, put on an iron face and muttered a string of foreign words, as if ordering the Chinese constable:</p>
<p>"Careful; be vigilant, don't let anything slip by."</p>
<p>The Chinese constable showed an even greater look of obeying orders and being loyal to his duty, moving his thick and long hands, ceaselessly searching the merchant from head to toe!</p>
<p>...The merchant, unable to bear this oppression, said painfully:</p>
<p>"Officer! I'm sorry, I only have five silver dollars on me, borrowed from my fellow villagers from ×× Road ×× Lane. Please don't search, I wouldn't dare hide contraband as a businessman. I'm really scared to be searched, thank you very much for letting me go!"</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, "Damn it! Don't move!" the Chinese constable shouted fiercely at the merchant, while taking out a shiny pistol from his pocket and waving it twice in front of the merchant's face, "Are you going to move?" At the same time, the two foreign constables who were issuing orders, simultaneously bestowed him with a slap on the ear, and the other with a foreign ham fist; and also spoke in Shanghai dialect:</p>
<p>"You bastard! You're being difficult, suspected of being a reactionary! Don't run..."</p>
<p>Thus, the Chinese constable, looking victorious, grabbed the merchant by the scruff of his neck as he trembled, and dragged him to the ×× Bureau, go, go, go.</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>Since the 19th Route Army withdrew from Wusong, Zhabei, and Jiangwan due to insufficient reinforcements, there has been the so-called ceasefire conference. The ceasefire conference has been going on for a month, and outsiders naturally don't know what exactly is being discussed there. These days, I've heard that because the Japanese are insisting on unreasonable demands, the situation is precarious, and there is a risk of the ceasefire conference breaking down. Since this news was announced in various newspapers, I have been hoping every day that it would break down. This is truly an abnormal thought. People are there enduring humiliation and making concessions, hoping for the success of the ceasefire conference, but I am here hoping for it to break down.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it's abnormal or not, the newspaper seller Zhang San has earned a lot of copper coins from me because of this news. Originally, after the 19th Route Army withdrew, his career of selling sensational news extras plummeted. No matter how hard he shouted outside the door, I would ignore him. But these days, when he shouts: "Extra! Just published!" my heart suddenly starts pounding, filled with the hope of a breakdown, a breakdown! But after buying it and seeing, "Today's subcommittee meeting, tomorrow's subcommittee meeting," peace is nowhere in sight, and a breakdown is just as unattainable! I can't help but curse the damned Zhang San for tricking me again!</p>
