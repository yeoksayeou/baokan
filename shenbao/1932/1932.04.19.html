<h3>達爾文五十週年祭　翰</h3>
<p>近世最偉大之科學家英人達爾文。生於一八○九年二月十二日。殁於一八八二年四月十九日。今日適爲其逝世五十週忌辰。</p>
<p>達氏著作極爲豐富。於生物學貢獻極大。就中一八五九年出版之物種原始與一八七一年出版之人類原始兩書。尤保有永永不可磨滅之光輝。　　達氏學說之精神曰「物競。」曰「天擇。」物競者。物類互競生存也。天擇者存其進化之適宜者而滅其進化之不適宜者也自物競天擇之說出思想界乃爲之大變。一般人甚至稱「一八五九年以後之時期爲達爾文時期」達氏之說。在生物科學上之貢獻有二。一爲總合達氏以前各派之生物進化論。奠定其新基。一爲擊破從前的神權論與玄學的進化論。而確定其科學的價値。抑且使其與達氏稱爲「進化論前輩」之斯賓塞氏之應用「進化原則」於社會科學更獲得科學的確切闡明。明故達氏學說之確立殆即可謂爲人類思想劃時期之標誌。</p>
<p>達氏之學說。自有專家爲之評述。吾人初不必加以訾議或譽揚。惟其一生爲學之精神。則誠足爲吾人之模範。茲當撮取其生平之事實。略爲介紹。</p>
<p>達氏幼時。即喜搜集生物。人多視爲頑童。稍長好旅行。嗜射獵。其父嘗責爲　　「只知道射獵·畜狗捉老鼠不知道作正經事業。將來一定要遺自己以及家庭之羞。」十六歲時。曾學醫藥但非其所喜。一入三一年得享斯魯敎授这提携得附比格爾船旅行。終以此行而獲得研究其所喜之科學之機。會而成爲偉大之科學家。此種事實之敎訓最爲我國今日之敎育家與父兄所應接受。蓋死書堆裏與機械式之學校中。常屈殺天才。而活的敎育活的學校。始能培養出偉大之思想家達氏之成功即其一例也。</p>
<p>達氏爲學之精神。爲切實。爲耐勞。赫胥黎嘗贊謂「達氏所最懼者爲空想。猶自然之所懼者爲空虚。」達氏自傳中亦云。「予之所勝於常人者。在能顧及常人所不易注意事而留意觀察之。予視察及搜集諸事實。務盡其所能。」此種耐勞踐實之精神。則又我國今日虚浮驕恣之靑年所應秉爲模範者也。</p>
<p>達氏一生多病最後四十年。殆無一日享受　人之健康但其對於學問之</p>
<p>研究。則初不以病而一日輟至其著書立說。更極爲謹愼。物種原始一書。曾費十年長時期之研究。出版之前瓦雷斯已有「由原祖之形分支到無限的種類之傾向」一書問世。然而達氏初不以此而懈其志。此種不計近利。不求近效。不尙虚榮之爲學精神。則臾我國今日好大喜功高談闊論之靑年所應奉爲師法者也。</p>
<p>我國今日。文化停滯民族生命。亦瀕於斷續茫茫前途。至堪憂慮。吾人深盼全國靑年。效法達氏治學之精神。執科學之火把。導我民族悠遠古老之文化於再生之途。</p>

<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯外交委員會得悉海蘭泡之中國領事、以密碼電報代現方逃居黑龍江之馬占山將軍、傳達其簽字申訴書至中國及他國各處地方、惟此舉實屬濫用其所享之權利、且足以破壞蘇聯政府所取對於滿洲事件絶對不干涉之政策、故外交委員會已决定請求滿洲政府（？）召回現在海蘭泡之中國領事、而易以他人、同時政府已電達海蘭泡當局、令暫時停止中國領事發電、（十八日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）日俄邦交雖有日見緊張之說而俄國請滿洲政府派新領事以代黑河中國領事之舉、已引起日本政界甚良好之印象、俄當局之出此、因該領事曾用密碼電代馬占山發出電文也、日當局宣稱、蘇俄此舉、可以消除馬占山逃八俄境之謠言、同時並可阻止華員續向國聯調查團作排日之宣傳、（十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>與護路兵略戰即退</p>
<p>（哈爾濱）據今日陶賴昭傳來消息、有俄人七八名、參加新近擬毁松花江橋之謀、此橋在陶賴昭與松花江第二站之間、據警察查報、此橋除由滿洲國兵士看守外、在每次車過以前、輒有兩路員檢查、發見炸橋密謀之夜、兩路員在橋端照常供職、一在松花江方面、其人名古曾索夫、係俄人而入中國籍、一在陶賴昭方面、名格里波夫、當哈埠開來之貨車將到時、古曾索夫沿橋而行、但未見格里波夫回答信號、渠深異之、仍向前再進、忽遇執槍俄匪二名、强令其隨行、未幾貨車至前、渠舉起緩行信號、車距渠甚近時、渠躍過軌道、俄匪因有貨車相隔、莫能追及之、渠乃奔至松花江第二站、報告華兵、於是兵士立即出巡、查見格里波夫已飮彈而死、相隔不多遠處、有俄人數名、皆執槍械、兵士乃對之射擊、交戰數分鐘、俄匪後退、橋旁遺下炸藥不少、據專家意見、匪擬毁此橋、籌備數夜、如未及時發覺、則此橋或將於是夜轟毁、（十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>（哈爾濱）東鐵俄當局與東鐵護路軍、互諉東鐵日兵車傾覆責任、日方再派員調查、（十八日專電）</p>
<p>（東京）今日接哈埠日領署報告、據謂本月十三日日兵車遇炸出軌事、就調查所及、雖尙無切實證據、但似爲俄國共産黨炸毁路軌所及、並謂蘇俄已調集九師兵於遠東、故時局或較易起釁云、政府發言人今日言及俄軍調集遠東事、謂日本亟願避免與俄衝突之可能、故除絶對必要外、日本不欲派兵東至海林、觀俄軍之分配、俄國似準備戰事、但係防禦性質、而非攻擊性質、俄國現增厚薩哈運防兵、並希置防務、該處未有日軍、故若一旦有事、則日人之油井、將爲俄人所支配、但目前不致有事云、（十八日路透社電）</p>

<h3>軍縮會議總委員會開會</h3>
<p>領導原則仍未能商定</p>
<p>逐步减縮案修改文字</p>
<p>我國提案響應者寥寥</p>
<p>國民社十八日日内瓦電　今日軍縮會議總委員開會後、未及數分鐘、各代表即開始談及、在數年内再開大會問題、至此次大會之領導原則、今日會議中仍未能商定、雖有數代表演說、祗發滔滔雄辯、力言有召集數次大會、期可逐步减縮軍備之必要而已、</p>
<h3>史汀生感冒未出席</h3>
<p>今日總委員會係上午十時十七分召集、當各代表陸續入席時、塲中已顯出緊張空氣、代表與旁聽者、均亟待美國務卿史汀生之責臨、主席漢德森視赴門旁相候、約歷十餘分鐘、祗見吉伯生到會、遂返主席臺、吉氏報告、史汀生因感冒風寒未能赴會、於是會議正式開始、</p>
<h3>提出土德建議原則</h3>
<p>主席漢德森請各代表對於領導會議進行之原則、期可獲得普天下減縮軍備之可行基礎各抒意見、並提出土德兩國代表建議之原則、主張本會應採用一種單純偉大之公約、完全解决軍縮問題、聲稱倘此項原則爲會衆所否决、則本會將遵循逐步減縮之原則、以策進行、德代表那度民乃首先發言、提議以强迫軍縮爲本會之矩矱、聲稱苟有誠意與忠實之志願、謀軍備之減縮、則凡德國之所曾爲者、他國皆倣行、於是盡力聲述土德提議之妥善、勸各代表抛棄自私的國家政策、以眞實減縮軍備爲唯一志願、共策會務之進行、宣稱倘吾輩今日僅就現有之軍縮基礎、加以一度確定外、别無建樹、則將違反國聯會章之宗旨與精神、今德總理白魯寗亦未到會、故由那氏發言、</p>
<h3>六小國之聯合提議</h3>
<p>次乃提出比·捷·挪·尼（尼魯圭）丹·愛（愛沙尼亞）諸代表聯合提議、主張逐步减縮軍備、認爲實行定章第八欵这唯一途徑、内稱、軍備之减縮唯有逐期進行、在最短之時間内、迭爲連續之修改、始克有濟等語、於是法國出巨力以作此提議之後盾、波闌亦力爲辯護、德代表則請將此决案加以修改、</p>
<h3>李維諾夫語中帶諷</h3>
<p>蘇俄人民外交委員李維諾夫亦登台演說、譏刺主張逐步軍縮計劃之各代表、含笑聲稱、本届大會不若對於軍縮途徑先有成就、作爲努力之開始、然後再將大部份工作、移交二届三届大會之爲愈、</p>
<p>次英外相西門演說雖表同意於再開大會、與常加修改之主張、然表示本届大會、當須有若干實在成績、聲稱勿令吾輩年年在日内瓦度此長日、</p>
<h3>我國提出完全軍縮</h3>
<p>又次中國代表登壇、提出完全軍縮之計劃、以比任何代表所貢獻者、更爲急進與偉大、四座爲之震驚、中代表主張由大會定各國應有之軍備、在鄭重考量一國國防上眞正重要元素、并規定其適宜防衛上所需之最少限度、聲稱一國之軍備、應以國家領土之大小、人民之多寡、邊境之長短與性質及國内之富源爲决定根據、而其海陸空交通之便利、及對於外來侵略之安全程度、當亦考慮及之、此次中國提議、就道義與物質方面兼顧並籌、不僅主張廢除某種軍備、且欲製成促進全世界精神上軍縮之實際方案、謂目下世界各政府、未能從心理方面與道德方面、謀軍備之减縮、因此仍有扶植狹義的國家主義、盡力培養國民之好戰精神者、至於物質方面、則主張廢除、切侵略軍器如戰鬥艦·潛水艇·飛機母艦·重砲一切軍用飛機、及一切化學與毒菌戰爭、</p>
<h3>逐步减縮案佔優勢</h3>
<p>無如會中多贊成逐步减縮軍備者、對於中國與德國之急進提議、響應寥寥、日本瑞士法蘭西波蘭瑞典英吉利意大利波斯與荷蘭先後登台、均贊成六小國聯合提議、德國土耳其蘇俄則皆請將此聯合提議在付表决以前、加以修改、主席漢德森乃將該提議、移送起草委員會修飾文字、遂於十二時三十分散會、</p>
<h3>日本股票大跌</h3>
<p>電通社十八日東京電　日財政界正在期望日本銀行之减息、但日本内外財政狀况、日見惡劣、股票市塲今日賣方又盛、東股市場起初即現低價、至下午棉紗生絲、又與主要股票相繼慘跌、以東新股近期慘跌爲最甚、竟達百三十八日金之低價、若與金再禁後之買進最盛時相比較、即比較十一月終之百七十九元九角、實跌近四十日金以上、</p>

<p>英美對外政策意見接近</p>
<p>國民社十七日日内瓦電　美國務卿史汀生今晚與德總理白魯寗外次蒲洛、作長時間談話、按史汀生抵歐以來、與各大國當軸分别晤談、此爲第三次、其第一次係與法總理泰狄歐在巴黎長談、第二次則爲今午與英外相西門同膳暢談、據官報發表、今晚史汀生與白魯寗曾澈底討論軍縮及各急要經濟問題、互述本國政府之政策與意志、明日白魯寗將續與英外相西門意外相格蘭第及丹外相慕恩樞等晤談此事、</p>

<h3>波蘭財長赴法</h3>
<p>國内工業瀕於破産</p>
<p>將向法國借巨債</p>
<p>國民社十八日華沙電　波蘭財長古恩、今日突赴巴黎、料與向法國再借巨債計劃有關、故金融界極爲重視、據稱、波蘭若不得借欵、勢將無法維持、蓋該國雖屬農業國、對於經濟衰落、比純粹工業國、可以抵抗稍久、但國内工業、已瀕破産之境、各大工業因近日國家銀行拒絶貼現、蘇俄票據尤感窮困、如上西萊細亞數工廠、僅有足敷數天開支之現欵、現料法國或將乘機提出較苛條件、但波蘭苟無迅速之接濟、將發生嚴重之危局、</p>
<h3>火柴大王僞造意國庫劵</h3>
<p>經意官廳正式徴實</p>
<p>法國方面損失甚巨</p>
<p>國民社十七日羅馬電　今日此間官廳已正式徴實克魯格公司資産内、發見僞造意大利國庫劵、面値達二千一百萬鎊、據稱偵劵上假造意故財政大臣波塞里之署名、但極拙劣、一般常做國際債劵貿易者、决不能受欺、再意大利與火柴大王克魯格、從未發生任何財務關係、當一九三○年頃、克氏曾向意政府接洽供給巨額借欵、以謀取得火柴專賣權、但意政府立予拒絶、</p>
<p>國民社十七日阿姆斯特丹電、電訊電報財政主筆、今日論克魯格杜爾公司最近發展、估計法人所購該公司與其附屬各公司之股票、共達五萬萬佛郎以上、故此後除瑞典之外、或將以法國損失爲最重云、</p>
<h3>立陶宛案定期開審</h3>
<p>國民十七日海牙電　今日國際法庭主席法官辦事室發表米美爾公約四簽字國控告立陶宛政府一案、定於六月二十二日公開審理、按本案原告爲英法意日政府、控立陶宛違犯米美爾公約、用高壓手段强米美爾議會組織行政委員會、議會拒絶、即將其解散云、</p>

<h3>南斯拉夫大水爲災</h3>
<p>國民社十八日貝爾格勒電　南斯拉夫南境大水爲災、房屋湮没數千所、居民皆無家可歸、當道竟别出奇計、用轟炸飛機抛擲炸彈轟燬堤壩、欲期泛濫較廣、以殺水勢、但農民亦有不以此舉爲然、向飛機開槍者、第尙未聞有飛機受損、</p>
<h3>紐西蘭海員準備罷工</h3>
<p>路透社十八日奥克蘭電、今日聞海員有立即宣布罷工之說、星期杪城中雖安靜、但擾亂份子仍伏四處、故人心仍甚驚惶、店主現向政府請求賠償被搗碎之玻璃窗及刦去之貨物之損失、聞總數達四萬鎊左右、</p>

<p>要聞</p>
<h3>國聯與日本勢將正面衝突</h3>
<p>英美對僞國取同一態度</p>
<p>美將撤消駐東京大使館</p>
<p>大阪每日新聞日内瓦電云、十九國委員會業已開會、預料中日問題之前途、將有大發展、而問題中心點、形式上决定適用盟約第十五條以處置滿洲事件、然實質上國聯究竟抱如何態度、尙難預料、惟德辣蒙事務長、對於佐藤代表、已言明滿洲問題必須用盟約十五條、復値美國國務卿史汀生正在日内瓦活動、中國代表又以九國條約大張旗幟、則滿洲問題將演出大活劇、不言而喻、今史汀生雖無明白的表示、但其態度、預料必爲形勢所轉移、因此滿洲國在根本上、恐發生種種枝節、特日本因國聯適用第十五條、是正面的衝突、愈爲急迫、一方最堪注意者、美國對日本態度强硬時、英國亦必步武美國、採同一步調、如是英美二國、勢必立於共同戰綫上以對日、况美國外務次官伊藤大尉對下院質問、决不承認滿洲爲獨立國、則滿洲國前途之暗澹、已在意料之中云云、</p>
<p>大阪每日新聞華盛頓電云、美國國務卿史汀生、曾提出節約經費案於上院、擬閉鎖在外大使館與領事館、目下雖不明示何國何地的館址、應行撤消、但聞駐東京</p>
<p>大使館、亦在閉鎖之列、</p>
<h3>日人在東北决添設領事館</h3>
<p>並在滿鐵沿線添設警署</p>
<p>大連通信、日人爲實現其侵略東北之具體計劃計、現已着手籌備在敦化·寗古塔·洮安·海倫·四處設置領事館、在扶余·一面坡·帽兒山·（臨江）三姓·穆稜·五處設領事分館、此外並在滿鐵沿線添設警察署十一署、此事經於上月由日内閣會議通過、交外務省積極進行、現外務省派遣田中都吉專員、到東省各地視察、隨時隨地辦理設館事宜、各領事館·分館·及警署、均定於本月中旬先後成立、經費每年預定爲一千萬、業經芳澤外相、向各閣員求得諒解、此項經費、將正式追加於預算案内、</p>
<h3>調查團由京西上情况（八）</h3>
<p>附錄國聯處置中日糾紛經過</p>
<p>又主席宣言大意說、行政院爲維持世界和平及促進中日糾紛解决起見、曾一致議决派員往滿洲就地調查、關於該决議案之内容、茲詳細分段解釋、該决議案第一段再聲明九月三十日由行政院全體一致通過决議案之有效、堅持日本軍隊應於最短期間、在該條所定條件之下、退回南滿線内、行政院對於該决議、十分重視、并深望兩方政府、能切實履行第二段、對於前次行政院閉會後所發生的情形、更加嚴重、而予各方以正當之憂慮深爲惋惜、故兩方應即自加檢束、避免從新發生戰事及一切擴大糾紛的行動、第四段、請其餘各國政府、隨時以其在滿洲代表寄來之情形、報告國聯、因以往之經騐、證明此種消息其用甚大、目下已在滿洲派有此項代表之國家、應該維持現狀、並應當設法增進其效力、上述國家之政府、亦應與中日政府、繼續往來、以便中日政府、隨時可請其當地代表至某地點工作、第五段、决定遣派之調查團、乃屬於諮詢性質、其權限極廣、在原則上該團之權限、爲凡關於妨碍國際邦交·及中日和平·或爲中日和平所倚賴之事、均可研究、中日兩國政府　亦可將一切問題、請該調查團研究、該團亦可自由簡擇一切問題、爲報告行政院的資料、遇必要時、可以隨時將特别情形、報告行政院、當該調查團行抵目的地時、如遇兩方仍未執行九月三十日的决議案、該團應將其情形報告行政院、如遇兩方直接交涉及與軍事有關之問題、該團不能干涉、但關於搜羅消息以作報告的資料、該團當然可以自由行動、主席宣言中關於第五段之解釋、其中意思、爲决議案所未明白言者、（一）爲兩國政府、可將一切問題、請該團研究一層、乃滿足日本調查我國抵制日貨運動和要求、因日代表曾請將此意思、納在决議案内、爲我國代表所反對的、（二）爲當該團行抵目的地時、若遇兩方仍未執行九月三十日之决議案、該團應即將其情形、報告行政院、此因我國放棄限期撤兵要求後、擬在决議案内作限期撤兵的間接規定、而爲日代表所反對、故將其納在主席宣言内、</p>
<p>就實際來說、這决議案、不過從新提起九月三十日决議案的效力、然由九月三十日至十二月十日爲時兩月有餘、在此時期内、齊齊哈爾及許多鐵路、先後爲日軍佔領、這次開會的結果、不過派一調查團、該調、團的效果如何、目下雖難預料、然事實已證明爲日本緩兵之計、蓋該團工作、非六閱月不能結束、在此時間内、日本在東省種種設施、可以完竣、而列强亦將無如之何了、</p>
<p>丙·各國之態度</p>
<p>（一）列强　日本扣留與日僑生命財産毫無關係之東省鹽稅、及攻陷齊齊哈爾之後、英法美等國政府、知日本所謂自衛、不過借題發揮、國聯公約之精神、已被完全破壞、設使中國日本爲歐洲小國、則國聯早已下討伐的命令、而日本亦必不俟討伐令下、而早已自動撤兵了、然而日本乃一遠東强國、受禍者又爲瀕年内亂政治崩潰的中國、故列强以日本爲狂漢、欲强迫其守法、必危害自身、中國爲一敗家子、又豈値得爲其犠牲、祗有觀望便算了事、這便是列强當時的態度、</p>
<p>然而日本自從破壞九月三十日行政院决議案之後、所謂素重道義之帝國令舉、旣已喪失無餘、猙獰面目、亦爲世人所窺破、故日本之利在最後的掙扎、除列强武力干涉或我國承認其割據滿洲外、實無他法可使其終止野蠻的行動、講到武力干涉問題、在表面上似可由國聯行政院根據公約十五十六條通過一决議案、就可令其五十個會員國家與美國合作、實行以武力對付日本、但實際上若要列强爲此作重大的犠牲、是一個甚複雜的問題很不容易解决、因爲美國尙未加入國聯、故一旦國聯在遠東有事、英國首當其衝、况且當時國聯討論中日糾紛、仍在第十一條範圍之内、根據國聯公約的規定、一切議案、均須兩造贊成、在法理上來說、九月三十日的决議案、並未限期撤兵、十月二十四日的决議草案、又未經日本所承認、日本無執行的義務、故當時英法政府、以爲和平旣得維持、算是幸事、希望於調查團工作完竣時候、中日兩國、能作相當的妥協、使日本軍隊終能撤退、則國聯體而、旣可勉强保全、而列强亦可免於犠牲了、</p>
<p>英國與美國的打算、旣是這様、其餘法意諸國、無不樂從、結果日本的强橫、雖比諸前次開會時爲尤甚、而列强的前進、除用武力以維持公約外、已達到無可再進的地步、故其態度、反由懦弱而至於畏縮、</p>
<p>（二）各小國家　至於弱小國家、因其地位與列强不同、而其本國領土完整唯一的礙障、又在乎國聯及非戰　約、故均盼列强能澈底解决目前中日的糾紛、但以其自身本毫無實力、而徒望列强的犠牲、自己又覺難於出口、故除西班牙代表之振振有辭外、其餘代表均噤若寒蟬、是復可嘆息的、（完）</p>
<h3>贛匪又竄閩南</h3>
<p>有一部取道瑞金入汀</p>
<p>閩軍正會同粤軍者剿</p>

<h3>江西景德鎭之現象</h3>
<p>滬戰影響瓷業前途極悲觀</p>
<p>各工廠因駐軍移防未開工</p>
<p>南昌通信、景德鎭居贛省之東北部、北接皖南、東連浙西、就地理關係言、實爲贛浙皖之屏藩、自宋以來、産瓷馳名、千餘年號稱瓷産工業區、工人二十餘萬、前年三次遭匪攻陷、工商業損失數千萬、已達破産狀態、年來由五十五師駐防、匪氛稍戢、市面亦漸恢復、乃滬戰發生、金融阻滯、該鎭瓷業、因又大受影響、祗平津香港等處有少數瓷客外、餘多裹足不前、於是該鎭工商業、遂無形停頓、全市經濟困難、益臻極點、敎育實業各項經費、來源皆無着落、前月工商各界有鑒於此、曾開會討論救濟辦法、擬定趕速力勸各廠開工、一面由商會向滬銀行界借欵週轉、以維工人生活、該鎭慣例、各廠開工、統於廢曆三月初一日、凡來鎭做工工人、不論開工與否、三月初一日起、伙食係由資方負擔、故工人多有只帶川資者、今年正在設法救濟之際、五十五師忽奉令回皖、該鎭人民、懼匪乘空重來、無不驚惶異常、各廠亦因此不敢開工、全鎭因之頓陷於恐慌狀態、工商各界、特推賴淸施文謨等代表分向中央及贛省各高級機關請願在接防隊伍未經指定以前、五十五師暫勿調防、以維治安、庶使該鎭二十餘萬工人、不致失業、免爲赤匪煽動云、</p>
<h3>蕪湖救濟災民之進行</h3>
<p>各界並組織金融維持會</p>
<p>蕪湖通信、縣水利工程委員會、刻以四鄕災民、無衣無食者、數逾十萬、亟應急謀救濟、前擬集價値百萬之契據、由商會轉向米帮抵借食米五萬石、借給災農、待至秋收、本利歸還、茲以事體重大、乃定本月十七日、在縣政府召集黨政軍警紳商各界、開聯席會議討論辦法、此舉如果實行、則全縣災民、可維百日之糧食、</p>
<p>蕪市自上年水災之後、繼以滬戰發生、以致金融異常奇窘、各商幾乎破産、蕪湖縣商會爲救濟金融維持市面起見、十三日特召集各界開聯席會議、議决組織金融維持會、規定委員十五人、由銀行界推舉二人、錢莊一人、各業七人、黨政軍警各推一人、并推陳後二胡棟臣等起草組織大綱、定十六日舉行第二次各界會議、提出通過實行、</p>
<p>行駛大通蕪湖間之協和公司陞隆小輪、十三日淸晨由大通開駛來蕪、行抵大新洲附近、突遇匪徒三十餘人、包圍騎劫、共計損失現洋金條匯票等約一萬餘元、</p>
<h3>地方消息</h3>

<h3>厘市稍稍生色矣</h3>
<p>其奈缺乏得大銷胃何</p>
<p>昨日洋厘以供求方面、雖較前日差勝、然無重大胃口、遂致價格無軒輊可能、結果兩市間僅差一毫二忽半、計早市爲七錢○三厘、午市爲七錢○二厘八毫七忽半、而較前日市况似已好起六</p>
<p>毫二忽半矣、銀拆兩市仍爲一錢、與前日相埓、銀行掛牌亦同、計爲四分、劃頭加水大鬆僅爲五六分、雖開盤時做過八九分、亦如曇花一現耳、</p>

<h3>長期交易不過屬於多年户頭</h3>
<p>昨聞金融界消息、祗老户頭仍有大批轉賬及交易、而息價總須較上届加昂、據云至少須十兩○五錢及十一兩不等、各帮需要不多、然客帮方面、除少數殷實者得以賡續外、其他方面雖上届欵項了結之家、恐亦難有濟、罔論普通商號也、至於存欵長期、以目前大額欵項進出仍縛於同業匯劃範圍、故類率轉賬云、</p>
<h3>紗花紗銷淸靜</h3>
<p>棉紗市情　依然平澹、毫無振作精神、實以現紗走銷遲滯、且時局迷離、致人心萎挫、而洋厘仍難回蘇、内地農忙在即、紗銷一層更無希望、長江一帶久　停頓、所以底貨尙有增加之勢查全日各帮買去統計三百包行情微跌二錢半、客帮北帮進三十包、内地進六十包、安慶進二十包　廣東進三十五包、長沙進十包、漢口帮進七包、汕頭進四十包同行中進六十包云</p>
<h3>布襪廠消費衰落細紗跌勢劇烈</h3>
<p>細紗市情、邇來大落、且跌勢劇烈、大有江河日下之慨、查往年在春銷之際、例有一度發展、以白色之布疋、在夏季中、銷量爲最暢旺之時、如江浙一帶、布襪廠杯立、需要大有可觀、今庚因日軍犯境以來、大戰之後、金融不能流通、銷路大受打擊、查四十二支人鐘線在三月份中、曾達三百四十二兩、現售二百九十六兩、兩相比較、竟跌四十六兩、三十二支人鐘二百五十六兩、現爲二百三十二兩、亦跌二十四兩、此種跌風、可爲銳利矣、測之大勢狀况、前途尙難樂觀查去年東北政局突變後、本線不足供給應用、各布襪廠發生恐慌、有停工之虞、其後定用英國線、以資補充、一塲風波、遂告平息、然價格高至四百兩外、廻想前漲今跌之情形、誠令人有今昔之感焉、</p>
<h3>原棉廠辦稀疏</h3>
<p>棉花市情平靜　而外棉狀况、又現軟化之象、但匯票尙虚、致人心平平　各廠態度極澹　採辦之意甚少、因紗銷不暢　據一部份云、日廠以滬戰發生之後、工廠完全封鎖、去年購進美印棉甚多、現以需要缺乏　大有過剩、亟欲謀脫售去、今由印商售於申新廠印棉一千件、但本棉存底枯涸、各路來源凋敝、惟申新廠仍有辦量、計開進興亨花一千件、三十兩半、現貨送廠、</p>

<h3>記王排長　保鄭</h3>
<p>王君忘其名。直奉之役。曾任排長。旋以部隊瓦解。遂卸甲歸里。專心經商。以善於操營。累有盈餘。積資甚夥，滬戰開釁。義勇軍風起雲湧。盛極一時。有志之士。爭往投効。王君疾呼曰。報國復仇。此其時矣。乃朿裝就道。面謁十九路軍蔡軍長。請予收編。蔡軍長見其形貌魁梧。談吐不俗。遂以軍事上種種關鍵相質詢。王君對答如流，毫無舛誤。乃派爲後隊留用。王君堅欲遄赴前線。甚至涕淚交下。蔡軍長不忍拂其意。遂允焉。適雙方正在休戰期中。王君靜伏戰壕。一俟敵人逼近。舉槍射擊。彈無虚發。連斃敵人無算。當局聞之。遂擢爲排長。未幾。衝鋒令下矣。王君舉刀指虜。奮勇登先。槍尖到處。敵人望風披靡。我軍聲威。因之大振。蔡軍長嘉其神勇。升爲連長。並調後方休息。王君詣前請曰。宿仇報矣。於願已足。何戀戀乎功名爲。卸裝棄械。掉頭竟去。後據其同伴言。方知王君之父。在靑島爲日人所殺。此行純爲復仇云。</p>
<h3>漢奸　公羽</h3>
<p>淞滬戰旣作。忽産生一新名詞。即江北漢奸是也。報端幾排日登載江北漢奸受日人僱用。至租界各處擲彈。及我軍撤退。漢奸益衆。亦皆冠以江北。致各界人士對於江北籍者。莫不唾棄之。實則甘爲漢奸者。其籍貫初不限於江北。戰爭初期所破獲之漢奸。亦有非江北人。報載可按。即如吳淞。近日亦有傀儡組織。其中人物。又豈屬江北籍乎。然而社會不察。幾以爲凡是漢奸。皆必江北人爲之。因之凡是江北人。皆在唾棄之列。且由思想的唾棄。進而爲事實的排斥。遂致戰後之江北人。有不能立足於上海之勢。如僱用娘姨者。僱用車夫者。均拒絶江北籍。甚至難民收容所亦不收江北籍難民。此眞寃哉。不知江北非一地名稱。乃泛指長江以北。長江以北之各縣人民。固已有良莠文野之别。而僑寓上海之江北人。又何嘗全不愛國。今竟拒絶江北人立足上海。則一般不肯作漢奸之勞工。旣不能生活。又不能回籍。勢且迫之往閘北作漢奸去矣。故今後吾人希望執筆者對於漢奸。應審明其籍貫。不能以意爲之。槪曰江北。始庶乎得其平也。</p>
<h3>世界小事記</h3>
<p>世界第一個飛行家　飛行事業之在今日。可算是全盛時代了。然而全世界第一個飛行家是誰。却知道的很少。此人是南美洲巴西人。名白索洛茂干士木。Ｂartholomeu　De　Cusmao他去世已有一百多年了。這一百多年來。幾乎没有人提起他。直到如今。巴西人飲水思源。纔想起這位開風氣之先的飛行先覺來。打算給他造一座紀念碑。以資觀感。據巴西人考據所得。他最初飛行時。還遠在一千七百零五年。有没有這回事。尙在疑似之間。巴西人與葡萄牙人都有圖繪。畫着他當初飛行的那艘怪飛船。但在一千七百零九年間。他確曾飛行過一次。有當年葡萄牙女王寫給伊母親的一封信爲證。這信是在飛行後的第二天寫的。伊說。「我眼見那干士木的飛船扶搖直上。很快意的到空中去了。」他前後共飛二次。第一次飛到一座三層樓的屋子那麽高。繞着屋子飛行一周。安然降落。第二次却没有飛成。一上去就掉落了。（海客）</p>
<p>滬戰與軍器（十三）一臧</p>
<p>火藥與炸藥　火藥的起源甚古。我國漢朝。已有此物。其用於發射。相傳始自阿刺比亞人。再傳至歐洲。但阿刺比亞人的火藥爲黑色。是硝石硫黃木炭三物混合而成。恰與我國人用松脂硝粉木炭所製的。成分相同。日本的火藥。就是傳自我國。十七世紀中葉。德國人發明一種褐色火藥。至一八四五年。又發明線火藥。歐洲各國。遂作爲裝置槍砲之用。一八八四年。法國發明綿藥系無烟火藥。我國各大兵工廠。亦能製造。至於有强烈爆發性的黃色火藥。係法人帝爾班所創始。近來各國皆作裝製野砲或作榴彈用。至十九世紀中葉。歐洲又有茶褐色火藥發明。惟現今軍事上所用的火藥。可分爲發射火藥。</p>
<p>破壞火藥。炸裂火藥等三種。其在組成上。約分爲化合火藥與混合火藥。無烟火藥利於發射。裝於步槍機關槍。以及中小口徑的砲内。混合火藥大都用於加農砲。但無烟火藥的種類很多。依槍砲的種類與火藥的性質。而異其用法。大凡主要彈丸的炸藥。則以黃色藥茶褐色藥茶黃色藥爲主。各種炸藥的主成分。多以硝酸鹽類鹽素酸鹽類過鹽素酸鹽類爲主。最近因科學的進步。製造技術的發達。火藥的品質。逐漸向上。發射藥中有無溶劑火藥。消熖火藥。猛射性火藥。無吸濕火藥等。於是槍砲的威力。愈加猛烈了。</p>
<h3>悲壯的死（下）墨逸</h3>
<p>半小時以後，敵人不像先前那様肆無忌憚的活動了，在三十幾輛唐克車後面，躱躱閃閃的衝過來。當然，他們得了第一次的敎訓，便不敢再蠻幹了，便用最新式的戰具—唐克車—作護身符，來衝鋒了。</p>
<p>我們的勇士對長官提議說：</p>
<p>「咱們若要把矮鬼都殺完了，非得把那幾個王八車滅了不可！」</p>
<p>於是，一隊負有毁滅敵人唐克車的責任的敢死隊，便馬上組成。他們一共是　四十個勇士。　　每一個人身上都塗着汽油，並且滿滿的都是炸彈。</p>
<p>當唐克車衝到離戰壕很近的時候，四十個爲中華民族爭光榮的勇士，便衝出去了，每一輛的唐克車像一條條的毒龍，從它們的嘴裏吐出致人死命的子彈。我們的勇士的手溜彈扔上去；彷彿拿鷄子兒扔到石頭上，只看見手溜彈爆裂，而唐克車仍是驕倣的衝過來，並且彷彿議笑的在說；「任你們怎様的厲害，這一下恐怕也不能把我們怎様了！」</p>
<p>四十個勇士有如四十俄虎食似的，張開兩臂，低着頭，急急的分頭去奪他們的目的物。等到他們距離唐克車很近，便都像中了子彈似的倒在地上。駕駛唐克車的敵人，都微笑着，表示他們戰具是怎様厲害，怎様堅固，以爲這一下總不能再予他們以前進的阻礙了。不知道那幾輛唐克車在四十個勇士身上爬過去的時候，那笨重的車西，壓在　那性如烈火的炸彈上，頓時使那二十世紀最新式的戰具失去了活動的能力，只聽到爆裂的聲音在那寛闊的車帶下響着；車子受了劇烈震動，便像匹匹的龐大的動物，受了重傷似的　着；爆炸的餘音，彷彿在發出嘲笑它們的歡聲。唐克車上的劊子手，也目瞪口呆的不知所措；同時在我們衝上來的勇士們的歡呼中，便都變成我們的俘虜和戰利品。</p>
<p>「老趙，你死得太慘了。唉，你的骨頭也没有了。」</p>
<p>但你死得痛快。唐克車上的敵人，咱準一個一個的揍死他們，給你報仇；你安心去罷。······老趙，咱們二十年以後再見罷。！···</p>
<p>老張和敵人肉塼的時候，邊殺着敵人。嘴裏邊說着安慰死在唐克車下的老趙。······（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>怎様是平時狀態</h3>
<p>— 金</p>
<p>昨據國民社消息，國聯十九國委員會會長希孟，現正與中日代表雙方磋商中，而其中最重要之一點，即爲平時狀態之解釋，這不是一椿滑稽而無聊的事件麽？若說不能恢復平時狀態的理由，我到有幾點可以說明，若欲恢復平時狀態，這個滑稽而開玩笑的問題，無論請泰西的羅輯家法學家，中國的鄭康成顔師古一般箋注家來詮釋，也决没有本領把這個滑稽的名詞解釋允當，</p>
<p>第一點，在日軍重兵壓迫之下，如何能恢復平時狀態，平時狀態之所以不能恢復，全由於日方之駐紮重兵，故欲恢復平時狀態，必須日軍先要完全撤退，</p>
<p>第二點，所謂認爲恢復平時狀態者，將以何國爲主體乎？將以我國觀察爲標準乎？將以日人觀察爲標準乎？抑以第三者觀察爲標準乎？假定他國認爲已恢復平時狀態，而日人曰否，不認爲恢復平時狀態，又將如何？</p>
<p>第三點，即使中日多已認爲恢復平時狀態矣，而日人詭計多端，或利用便衣隊，或假一般漢奸從中摀亂</p>
<p>，則又如何能恢復平時常態？</p>
<p>第四點，我國自經此次戰事以後，商與民之損失，不可以數字計，即使戰事就此終了，而民間之購買力，亦已减低不少，非特日貨無力購買，即各國之貨亦無力購買，如何能恢復平時狀態？并且大兵所到，廬舍爲墟，春旣失耕，秋何能穫，兵匪遍地，民無死所，如何能恢復平時狀態？</p>
<p>故國聯委員對於『平時狀態』四字，認爲重要而欲爲之解釋，眞是滑天下之大稽，現在國聯的委員，只要認淸國聯大會所議决的兩點，</p>
<p>一，國聯不承認或容許破壞中國領土之完整與政治主權，</p>
<p>一，在武力及其他脅迫下解决目前爭執爲不合法，國聯委員倘能認淸此兩點，這種無聊而滑稽的問題，請不必妄費心思再去考慮了，</p>

<h3>春雨</h3>
<p>— 柱尊</p>
<p>春愁似春笋，得雨簇簇生，春雨如春淚，通宵滴到明，春雨有時盡，我淚無時停，滴向階下草，草色哦不靑，灑向池中魚，池魚忽不生，問君何獨爾，豈有萬不平，何不策高足，並轡要津行，美人顔如花，逍遙洛陽城，</p>
<p>春雲何云云，言是戰鬼魂，上天復下地，化雨如傾盆，傾盆亦何爲，爲君洗腦筋，洗凈君腦筋，勿爲利</p>
<p>祿昏，鬼無還人日，國亡難再存，</p>

<h3>半自動來福槍</h3>
<p>— 左譯</p>
<p>最近美國有人發明一種新式步槍，稱爲半自動來福槍（Ｓcmi_automatic　Rfile)，現由美國軍事當局加以試騐，一經試騐及格，所有以前沿用的步槍將棄置不用，而代以此項新式步槍。</p>
<p>數十年來，從事擬造半自動來福槍者，頗不乏人，而結果都不美滿。最近提交美政府試用者亦有十餘種之多。現在試騐中者祗有二種，一爲彼得森（Ｊ·D·pedersen）所造，一爲茄蘭德（J·CGarand）所造。</p>
<p>關於半自動來福槍的優點，美軍官赫邱氏（Ｈatcber)曾向美國機械工程協會報告過，大意如下；</p>
<p>「現時所用陸軍步槍，即所謂連珠</p>
<p>槍者是也。連珠槍有彈藥瞠一，内貯彈藥筒五。當一藥筒放完後，用手撥動機關，當將空藥筒棄除，而裝上新藥筒，以待續放。惟撥動機關，動作繁複，且須使用大力，往往因此而延誤時機，或失却瞄準標的。半自動來福槍則不然，所有更換藥筒的動作半由藥筒自身擔任，使用者只須按動機鈕一下，極爲省力。故一旦瞄準後，可以連續開放，不致因換置藥筒而錯失鵠的。在未來戰爭中，飛機必將大施活動，軍隊隨時有被襲危險。如用連珠槍，每放一次，必先用手撥動機關，對於急動物體如飛機者，欲瞄準而連續射擊，勢所難能。是則半自動來福槍尙焉。」</p>
<p>按自動實彈法之應用放機關槍已有多年，但機關槍笨重無妨，而步槍則須力求輕便。今欲於步槍裝置自動機關而不增加其重量，自屬不易。半自動來福槍之難於成功，實由於此。查半自動獵槍已有數種，但其射擊力較之軍用步槍，相差殊甚。將來美國軍隊勢必改用此類半自動來福槍，殆無疑義。列强對於武備之用心，可見一斑。國人對此，作何感想？</p>

<h3>小報販的感覺</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>十四歲的報販阿保之開始在街上呌喚，遠在砲聲震瓦，火光赤天的時候。那時他的生意非常的好，所以那時的情景也特别深刻的留在他的記憶中。譬如那時他只要大聲喊着「阿要看到東洋□□吃敗仗」，便有人曾輕笑的望着他並隨口駡他一聲「小赤佬」，於是也歡喜的要一份去·····他以爲自己做生意的本領確是不壞，甚至比那些抽大烟的高明得多多。但是有一次在一條很熱閙的馬路上，他却看見一個十八九歲的女學生似的報販，賣報的手段是高明，她也用不着喊呌只要一路走去，自然有許多人喜笑的趨承她，甚至於使她應接不暇的手忙脚亂。可是，自己在同一時候同一地方却是一點生意也兜不着，於是他只得悻悻地跑開去。他想：</p>
<p>「媽媽的，我總不相信女人賣的報紙就會香些？」</p>
<p>然而現在却更是不同了，生意簡直没有，即使跑到從來不常去的大公館門口，喊破了喉嚨，也不見得有人來慷慨的買一張。這是什麽原故呢？在他以爲是不曾喊着「東洋□□吃敗仗」吧？可是他的父親已告訴他不能再喊，只能單純的呌「阿要剛剛出版······」，這有什麽辦法呢？</p>
<p>但是現在市面上畢竟大不相同</p>
<p>：譬如從此店門上貼的是「···罷市禦侮」現在却是「忍痛開市」了，從前到處是搬家的哭哭啼啼，現在却是黃包車坐着穿着簇新的春衣的漂亮姑娘了，從前是砲聲隆隆，現在却是留聲機的「西洋大笑」了。一切都是「大地回春」，一切都是「大上海」「自由市」的太平景象。於是電影塲裏塞滿了笑語輕盈，於是這小報販不復被人們所注意，而且就連那十八九歲的女報販也同様不再行時了吧？</p>
<p>總之現在是東洋人打勝了，大家都不必看報了，那末爲什麽就不打了呢？這對小報販一家人眞是一個大的損失啊！</p>

<h3>亦是江北人</h3>
<p>— 稚生</p>
<p>日昨下午，吾與數友閒講時事，高談闊辯，談興正濃，正欲飮茶止渴，忽聞賣茡薺者，高唱門前，乃喚之入，擇果論錢，價貨不當，一同學謔謂之曰，汝心太黑，何勿報效日人，則所入當非些呌販可比，</p>
<p>此人怒目𠮟曰，君輩皆知書達禮者，「何出此惡言誣我耶？夫爲漢奸者，非盡爲我江北同鄕，他處人亦間或有之，惟江北人佔爲多數，然不忠之名，已全加諸江北人矣，吾雖愚而下賤，然少小頗知愛國爲重，故此次事變，或亦有邀吾入夥爲漢奸者，吾輒拒絶之，吾誠知爲漢奸必多利，然狡兔死，走狗烹，利有何益焉，故吾願操此下業，忍苦自安也」</p>
<p>吾聞之便肅然起敬，遂不論價格而成交焉，旣而思之、江北人如此人者，誠不失其爲江北人之錚錚者以矣，人之良莠，本難齊一，不可以一人壞而累及衆人，故孔子曰，十室之邑，必有忠信，正是謂也，例如柳下盜跖，即昆弟之間，亦有良莠之别，江北人雖甘爲漢奸，然或亦有投身報國者在焉，爰急述之，以見江北人之非盡爲奸種也，</p>
<p>江北人做漢奸的眞多，因此本埠新聞之中，或投稿的先生們，往往大駡其江北人，我也着實痛恨江北人，又深深地爲江北人抱屈，因明知江北人並不完全是漢奸也，茲接稚生君投稿一文，題曰「亦是江北人」用特表而出之爲江北人一吐氣焉，編者附識，</p>

<h3>Darwin's Fiftieth Anniversary Memorial - Han</h3>
<p>Charles Darwin, the greatest scientist of modern times, was born on February 12, 1809, and died on April 19, 1882. Today marks the 50th anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>Darwin's works are extremely rich and his contribution to biology is immense. Among them, "On the Origin of Species" published in 1859 and "The Descent of Man" published in 1871, especially retain an eternal and indelible brilliance. The spirit of Darwin's theory lies in "competition" and "natural selection." Competition refers to the competition among species for survival. Natural selection refers to the survival of those who are suited for evolution and the elimination of those who are not. Since the emergence of the theory of competition and natural selection, the ideological world has undergone a major change. People even refer to "the period after 1859 as the Darwinian era." Darwin's theory has two contributions to biological science. One is to synthesize the evolutionary theories of various schools before Darwin and lay a new foundation for them. The other is to break the previous theocratic theory and metaphysical theory of evolution and establish its scientific value. Moreover, it enabled Spencer, who was called Darwin's "predecessor in evolution," to apply the "principle of evolution" to social science and obtain more accurate scientific clarification. Therefore, the establishment of Darwin's theory can almost be regarded as a landmark in the history of human thought.</p>
<p>Darwin's theory has its own experts to evaluate it. We do not need to criticize or praise it. However, his spirit of learning throughout his life is indeed worthy of our model. Now, let's extract the facts of his life and briefly introduce them.</p>
<p>Darwin liked to collect organisms when he was young. Many people regarded him as a naughty boy. When he grew up, he liked to travel and hunt. His father once scolded him, "You only know how to hunt and keep dogs to catch mice, and you don't know how to do serious business. You will definitely bring shame to yourself and your family in the future." At the age of sixteen, he studied medicine, but he didn't like it. In 1831, he was fortunate enough to be promoted by Professor Henslow and was able to travel with the Beagle. Eventually, this trip provided him with the opportunity to study the science he loved and become a great scientist. The lessons of this fact should be accepted by our country's educators and parents today. The reason is that geniuses are often killed in piles of dead books and mechanical schools, and only living education and living schools can cultivate great thinkers. Darwin's success is one example.</p>
<p>Darwin's spirit of learning is practical and hard-working. Huxley once praised, "What Darwin feared most was fantasy, just as nature feared emptiness." Darwin also said in his autobiography, "What I am better than ordinary people is that I can take into account things that ordinary people are not easy to pay attention to and pay attention to observation. I try my best to inspect and collect all the facts." This kind of hard-working and practical spirit is also what the frivolous and arrogant youth of our country today should take as a model.</p>
<p>Darwin was ill most of his life. For the last forty years, he hardly enjoyed human health, but his research on knowledge never stopped for a day due to illness. He was even more cautious when writing books and making arguments. The book "On the Origin of Species" took ten years of long-term research. Before its publication, Wallace had already published a book "The Tendency of Species to Depart Indefinitely From the Original Type." However, Darwin never slackened his ambition because of this. This kind of spirit of learning that does not value immediate interests, does not seek immediate results, and does not value vanity is what the youth of our country who like to be ambitious, talk big, and talk nonsense should follow as a teacher.</p>
<p>Our country today is in a state of cultural stagnation and the life of the nation is also on the verge of discontinuation. The vast future is worrying. We sincerely hope that the youth of the whole country will learn from Darwin's spirit of learning, hold the torch of science, and guide our nation's long and ancient culture to the path of rebirth.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Special Committee Met Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussing the Draft Proposal of the Shanghai Case</p>
<p>Restoration of Normal Status and Withdrawal of Japanese Troops</p>
<p>But Must Be Declared by Neutral Countries</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Still Insists on Reservations</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Geneva, 18th - League of Nations General Assembly Chairman Hymans has not yet received a document from the Japanese representative stating Japan's will regarding the Shanghai armistice conditions. Public opinion is that if Japan insists on reserving the right to declare at that time that the normal status of Shanghai has been restored and troops can be withdrawn, then the disputed issue cannot be resolved. China will naturally reject such conditions. It is reported that the draft proposal of the Special Committee of Nineteen stipulates that neutral countries should declare at that time that the normal status has been restored. This afternoon, the Special Committee is discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute. Under the chairmanship of Hymans, the meeting is still not open to the public. The purpose is to discuss the draft proposal. If an agreement can be reached, it will be submitted to the open meeting of the Special Committee. At that time, Chinese and Japanese representatives will be invited to attend. Today's meeting started at 3:45 PM. Neither the Chinese nor the Japanese representatives attended.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Geneva, 18th - The League of Nations Committee of Nineteen met at 3 PM this afternoon. Chairman Hymans was entrusted by the Committee last Saturday to consult with the delegations of China and Japan to find a solution acceptable to both sides. Hymans has obtained the consent of Nagaoka, the Japanese delegation leader and ambassador to France, to decide that the Sino-Japanese meeting will continue in Shanghai so that the compromise plan already scheduled ten days ago can have results. The plan stipulates that if Shanghai and its vicinity return to normal, the Japanese troops shall withdraw to the Public Concession and the area beyond the Public Concession roads within six months from the date of signing the armistice agreement. The draft armistice agreement had planned to organize a mixed committee to monitor the withdrawal of Japanese troops, but Japan objected to the mixed committee reporting the restoration of normal conditions to the League of Nations once a day. As for the Chinese side, the delegation has not yet received instructions from the Nanjing government, but it is believed that this instruction is expected to move towards a compromise.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 17th - The next meeting of the League of Nations Committee of Nineteen has been scheduled for tomorrow morning, which shows that the Committee has decided on a compromise solution. Chairman Hymans has reached an agreement with the Chinese and Japanese representatives. It is expected that the compromise solution will stipulate the establishment of a neutral committee to determine in the future whether the situation in Shanghai has progressed sufficiently to be called a return to normal so that Japan can withdraw its troops. This solution may be made into a resolution and submitted for voting at tomorrow's meeting.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 18th - It has just been learned that the Japanese representative has received instructions from the government. The Japanese government does not object to the resolution agreed upon by the Committee of Nineteen on the 16th, but it must be attached with an understanding that if the situation changes in the future, the new proposals regarding the Shanghai armistice meeting cannot bind Japan.</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Geneva, 17th - According to news from the League of Nations, the current obstacle in the Sino-Japanese negotiations in Shanghai is not the issue of monitoring the withdrawal of Japanese troops, but the decision on the unconditional withdrawal deadline insisted upon by China and opposed by Japan. League of Nations General Assembly Chairman Hymans has notified Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Yen and Japanese Delegation Leader Nagaoka of the results of yesterday's meeting of the Committee of Nineteen. Both sides have telegraphed their governments for instructions. At the same time, the Chinese representative expressed dissatisfaction with the procedures of the Committee and now advocates opening the Committee meetings to the public. Otherwise, the Chinese representative will seek to convene the League of Nations General Assembly. The Japanese side is optimistic, believing that the difficulties in Shanghai can be resolved satisfactorily. Reuter's News Agency, Tokyo, 18th - Responsible parties stated that instructions may be issued tonight in Geneva explaining that the proposal drafted by the League of Nations Committee of Nineteen regarding the withdrawal of Japanese troops from Shanghai can be accepted by Japan, but Japan will reserve the right to declare at that time whether it recognizes that normal conditions have been restored.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 18th - Regarding the secret meeting of the Committee of Nineteen held in Geneva on the 16th, the Japanese delegation reported the results to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday and requested instructions. It is said that the atmosphere of the Committee is favorable to Japan, acknowledging that Japan faithfully abides by the League of Nations resolutions of February 29 and March 4 regarding the Shanghai armistice meeting. In order to find a way to eliminate the difficulties of the armistice meeting's stagnation, the following proposal is planned for the withdrawal period of Japanese troops: 1. The Japanese government will issue a separate statement, "Hoping to see a return to normal state within six months." It is planned to delete "six months" and establish another organization such as a mixed committee to confirm whether or not the "normal state" has been restored. The formal issue of what authority the Committee of Nineteen has to put forward this proposal has not yet been resolved. Japan will instruct Representative Nagaoka on this matter after consultation with Yoshizawa this morning. Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 18th - Japanese Representative Nagaoka in Geneva, after meeting with League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond on the 16th, telegraphed to request instructions regarding the resolution of the Committee of Nineteen, saying that the Committee discussed the agreement proposed by the four ministers in Shanghai and recognized that Japan's claim was justified. Regarding the withdrawal period, it requested Japan to make concessions so that China could agree. The resolution is: (1) The Committee of Nineteen recognizes that the armistice agreement does not violate the resolutions of the League of Nations, and the meeting should continue in Shanghai. (2) Regarding the withdrawal period, the Japanese government should issue a separate statement, and the third article of Minister Blue's plan should be applied. Regarding the restoration of normal conditions, the fourth article should be followed, and the mixed committee should report to the League of Nations once a month. (3) The Committee of Nineteen, because the League of Nations cannot take more severe measures on the armistice issue, advises China to promote negotiations to the governments of the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, and their officials in Shanghai should mediate and negotiate to persuade them to continue the meeting. (4) After consultation, Foreign Minister Yoshizawa sent an instruction to Representative Nagaoka this afternoon saying that although the Committee of Nineteen's resolution on the armistice issue within its authority is not what Japan wants to interfere with, Japan believes that the resolution of the 16th is very appropriate and has no objection to it. However, the Japanese government hopes that it will be understood that the new proposals for armistice negotiations contained in the resolution cannot bind the Japanese government in the future. After the telegram reaches Geneva, the Committee of Nineteen will hold an open meeting to formally decide on the resolution.</p>
<h3>Rumor Has It That the Armistice Conference Will Be Reopened</h3>
<p>Kuo Tai-chi Returns to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The Meeting Will Be Held Tomorrow or the Day After</p>
<p>The armistice and troop withdrawal negotiations have been held for fourteen general meetings, but have been deadlocked due to the issue of the deadline for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. According to news from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vice Minister Kuo left Beijing by boat at 5 PM yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai today. It is said that the armistice conference will be reopened tomorrow. However, according to the notification from Geneva, if it cannot be delivered today, the armistice conference here may have to be postponed for one day.</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Nanjing, 14th - Vice Minister Kuo returned to Shanghai by boat at 5 PM this afternoon. Before leaving, he still had a meeting with Foreign Minister Luo at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Kuo told reporters that he expected the Sino-Japanese negotiations in Shanghai to resume soon. Kuo said that the National Government is now awaiting a telegram from Geneva. This negotiation is only a postponement and has not been abandoned. The American and British ministers are both staying in Shanghai, so he believes that the negotiations can be reopened soon, but the future is not very optimistic.</p>
<p>Far East News Agency said that at 11 AM yesterday, Japanese Minister Shigemitsu Aoi visited British Minister Lampson and asked him to continue to mediate. Lampson immediately agreed. American Minister Johnson was also present at the time and also expressed his willingness to continue his efforts.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Military News from the Front</h3>
<p>Suzhou, 18th Special Telegram - The Yanglinkou area is very quiet recently, and there is no sound of artillery. It was rumored that artillery fire occurred on the morning of the 16th, but after detailed investigation, it was found to be untrue. There are no official Japanese troops in Yuewang City, but every one or two days, twenty or thirty enemy soldiers come to patrol, buy goods in shops, and give prices at will. When buying canned food, they must first ask the shop owner to taste it to prevent poisoning. The refugees who returned home in Luduqiao are all able-bodied men in their twenties and thirties. They are searched very strictly by Japanese soldiers. If they carry copper coins made in Sichuan Province, they are suspected of being secret agents and killed without mercy. The market in Fuqiao is gradually recovering. There is no contact in Xizhuqiao, Taicang. The enemy in Xintang City has laid an electric net, dug trenches more than ten feet deep, and erected six large cannons. The enemy commander, Anzhuan Wan San, lives in the town's civilian houses. On the 18th, two Japanese planes arrived outside the North Gate of Taicang to conduct reconnaissance. At 9:20 AM, a Japanese plane arrived in Kunshan and circled Pan City more than ten times before heading east. One plane arrived in Suzhou in the morning and afternoon. British Army Counselor Stuart Both arrived at the headquarters of the Nineteenth Army on the 18th and was received by Chief of Staff Zhao. They talked for half an hour.</p>
<p>Kunshan, 18th Special Telegram - On the morning of the 18th, a Japanese plane came to Changshu and Taicang, circled twice, and then went to Zhizhitang and other places to conduct reconnaissance. Enemy spies often appear in Xintang City, Luduqiao, Hengli Bridge and other places. The enemy has been busy digging trenches in the direction of Liuhe in Xintang City for days.</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Expresses His Determination to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Chinese People Love China</p>
<p>Regardless of Success or Failure</p>
<p>▲Ma Zhanshan's Telegram</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan telegraphed to all circles in Shanghai yesterday, "Respected Mr. Huang Jinrong, Mr. Xu Jilong, Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Wang Yiting, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Shang Mujian, and all comrades of Mr. Wu Shan, Han Liru returned to the province and gave a detailed account of the earnest guidance and help from all the gentlemen. I am deeply grateful. I, Ma Zhanshan, am just a martial artist. I only know that Chinese people love China. On the 3rd of the month, I led the civil and military officials to Heihe in a hurry. On the one hand, I exposed the Japanese conspiracy to the League of Nations Investigation Team. On the other hand, I made a vow to resist to the death to save our nation. As for success or failure, I do not care. I still hope that you will give me advice from time to time so that I can use it as a guide. I am anxious and cannot express myself fully in this telegram. Ma Zhanshan bows."</p>
<h3>Lang Guanpu's General Telegram</h3>
<p>Lang Guanpu, Director of the Heihe Municipal Government Preparatory Office, telegraphed to General Zhu Ziqiao in Shanghai yesterday to provide evidence of Ma Zhanshan's determination to resist Japan. The original telegram reads, "Respected General Zhu Ziqiao, I have not seen you for a long time, and I miss you very much. I, Guanpu, have been a member of Hulun for many years. Recently, I have returned to Heihe and suddenly encountered a mutiny. I was ordered to take over as the Director of the Heihe Municipal Government Preparatory Office and handle the aftermath. I rushed to my post on the 3rd of this month and was preparing to take responsibility when Chairman Ma suddenly took the opportunity to review the defense on the 7th, traveling lightly and simply, and came to Heihe to organize the Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Office and the Provincial Government, expressing his determination to resist Japan and announcing the process of being used, saying that the provincial government moved from Hailun to the province, and in the middle, he repeatedly went to Harbin, Liaoning, and Changchun alone, cooperating with them on the surface, but in reality, he was spying on the internal details of the Japanese. Now that the spying is clear, it was originally planned to make a big move after the spring plowing was completed, but because the League of Nations Investigation Team is about to come to the east, if it is not disclosed in time, I am afraid that one hand will cover the eyes and ears of the world, and the Japanese cunning plan will succeed. Therefore, there is the telegram of the 12th. At this moment, he is training troops and repairing armor, planning to personally lead the strong soldiers to recover the rivers and mountains. His perseverance and determination do not hesitate to sacrifice temporary false fame and do what others cannot do. He is a national hero and a star of saving the country. I, Guanpu, am fortunate to be under his command and will naturally do my best to secure the rear. I have always recognized that you, sir, uphold justice, so I dare to briefly state the outline and ask for remote support to strengthen morale. I am eager to await orders. Lang Guanpu, Director of the Heihe Municipal Government Preparatory Office, bows."</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan's Reply</h3>
<p>General Zhu replied in a telegram,</p>
<p>"Director Lang of the Heihe Municipal Government Preparatory Office, I have received Ma General's telegram repeatedly. I am deeply impressed by his painstaking efforts and sincere dedication. In addition to announcing it to the people of the country, I have already sent a reply of support. I am very happy to receive your telegram. I hope you will pass it on to General Ma and our loyal and brave soldiers nearby to persevere and move forward, to encourage and improve the former practice, to win back the lost land for the country, and to awaken the loyal souls for the nation. All Chinese people will be the backing. The rear is under control, and the situation is developing in an orderly manner. I am especially happy to hear it. Zhu Qinglan."</p>
<h3>The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association</h3>
<p>Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Elected Twenty-Seven Directors</p>
<p>The Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army Support Association, organized by all circles in this city, held its inaugural meeting at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association at 4 PM yesterday. More than 60 people attended, including Jiang Wenyu, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Yichen, Chu Huiseng, Lin Youren, Tao Leqin, Yuan Jinchu, Feng Shaoshan, Hu Shuhua, and Ren Jinping. The charter was approved and directors were elected. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Chairman's Report - Chu Huiseng was publicly elected as chairman. He reported, "Since the Japanese invaders invaded our three northeastern provinces, Zhang Xueliang, the responsible official in the Northeast, has consistently implemented a policy of non-resistance. Although Ma Zhanshan's rise in Heilongjiang is relatively satisfactory, he then surrendered to the Japanese invaders due to lack of food and pay. After he telegraphed his rebellion, all our compatriots should provide assistance. Therefore, we have gathered all circles to organize the Support Association. Today is the time for the official meeting. Please contribute your opinions from all circles."</p>
<p>Election of Directors - After the general meeting elected Shi Liangcai, Xu Jigong, Zhao Yu, Lin Kanghou, Jiang Wenyu, Wen Qinfu, Feng Shaoshan, Xu Junren, Zhu Ziqiao, Chen Jiaji, Chen Peide, Wang Zhisheng, Li Cishan, Chu Huiseng, Hu Shuhua, Hu Fengxiang, Yang Xiaotang, Zhang Zilian, Zhang Juansheng, Yin Zhiling, Huang Jingwan, Shen Junru, Zhang Yichen, Lin Zhifu, Luo Yinpu, Wang Baozhen, and Wu Shan as directors.

<h3>Eden Talks About the Shanghai Case</h3>
<p>China and Japan Have Not Fought Recently</p>
<p>Postpone Discussion on Shanghai's Future</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, London, 18th - Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden declared in the House of Commons today that he did not want to express Japan's attitude towards the Shanghai ceasefire negotiations before a resolution was reached on the Sino-Japanese dispute in Geneva. According to investigations, the recent rumors of war between the two armies are completely untrue. It is actually the Chinese Fifth Army staging a fake battle for American film companies to shoot. Conservative Party member Knox asked the government to invite the relevant powers to negotiate with China on the future security of Shanghai based on the Feitham report. Eden replied that such a statement would only increase the difficulty of the current negotiations. All parties now wish to see the current negotiations succeed satisfactorily. Knox also urged the government to communicate with China and Japan together with the powers, saying that the long-term stationing of Japanese troops in Shanghai was due to the lack of security guarantees for Shanghai's future. Eden said, "We would like to address other matters after the current negotiations are resolved."</p>
<h3>Xiao's Mother Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Grand Welcome from All Circles</p>
<p>Madam Xiao De and her second son (Xiao Dejie's younger brother) will arrive in port this morning. Representatives from all walks of life have prepared a grand welcome, and the order has been agreed upon. All representatives must gather at the New Customs Wharf in the morning. At that time, Mr. Tang Haian, a representative of the National Government, will lead all representatives to take the Customs small wheel to the President Taft ship. Mr. Tang will introduce other representatives to Madam Xiao and her son. Mr. Tang will also deliver a welcome speech, and the women's circles will present flower balls. Later, Mr. Tang will lead Madam Xiao and others to take the Customs small wheel back to the New Customs Wharf to land. Secretary Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government and representatives of other groups will be waiting there. It is reported that the Welcome Committee has reserved the Cathay Hotel as Madam Xiao's residence.</p>
<h3>All Customs Offices in Liaoning Still Working as Usual</h3>
<p>Official news, Japanese personnel were sent to the customs offices in Yingkou, Dalian, Andong, Harbin, Aihui, and Longjingcun in the name of advisors of the Manchurian puppet state to contact the supervisors of the six customs offices for takeover, but were rejected by the six supervisors. Currently, the customs offices in these six places are still working as usual, and tax collection has not been suspended. All Chinese employees are still performing their duties as before. The rumor that all Chinese employees have been forced to return to Shanghai is not true.</p>
<h3>The Directorate General of Posts Has Not Reached a Compromise with the Puppet State</h3>
<p>Qian Chunqi Talks About Interference in Politics</p>
<p>Decide to Deal With It With Appropriate Measures</p>
<p>China East News Agency said that postal workers in the Northeast telegraphed to indicate that the Directorate General of Posts was negotiating with the puppet state on conditions in an attempt to seize the entire Northeast post office. A reporter from the China East News Agency visited Mr. Qian Chunqi, Director of the Directorate General of Posts, yesterday. The details of Mr. Qian's conversation and the postal workers' telegram are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Qian's Conversation</h3>
<p>According to Director Qian, the Ministry of Communications and the Directorate General regard the three northeastern provinces as our country's territory. Therefore, postal services are still maintained without interference from the puppet state in order to facilitate the people. If there is any interference in postal administration by force, a prepared and appropriate measure will be taken to deal with it. The accusations of the postal workers in the Eastern Provinces that the Directorate General is negotiating with the puppet state on the conditions of taking over the entire country are all untrue.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' General Telegram</h3>
<p>The National Postal Workers' Federation and the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union forward it to all colleagues and legal groups in the country. The puppet government supported by the Japanese came to take over the Liaoning Postal Administration, which is related to international transportation, on April 1. The Directorate General of Posts acted confused and did not know the overall situation. It issued a chaotic order to betray the country and humiliate the nation, ordering the Liaoning Bureau to negotiate the conditions of acceptance with the puppet state in an attempt to seize the entire country. The postal chiefs of the Shenyang and Harbin Bureaus are both foreign ministers and cannot be threatened by the puppet state and the Japanese slaves. Now they are forced to obey the chaotic orders of the Directorate General and have to recognize the traitors of the Republic of China and negotiate the surrender conditions with them. Betraying the country and humiliating the nation is heartbreaking. We colleagues deeply believe in the national duty of loyalty to the country and are ashamed to be officials of the puppet government. For the sake of the dignity of the Chinese nation and for the sake of personal integrity, we have to tearfully ask the Federation to quickly urge the postal authorities to cancel the chaotic order to negotiate conditions with the puppet state. It is better to die than to be preserved. (There are Japanese behind the puppet state, which is not the same as the domestic north-south war, where the post office can be co-managed by both sides.) If the puppet state forcibly takes over, the Directorate General can order all employees to withdraw, citing Article 27 of the Universal Postal Convention and notifying all countries of the International Postal Union to suspend all postal services in the three northeastern provinces as a blockade. Once this article is cited, even if the puppet state wants to use Japanese postal services, it is impossible. Because China, as a member of the Postal Union, announces the suspension of postal services in the Eastern Provinces, all member states cannot represent the delivery of mail sent to or from the Eastern Provinces. It is not too late to rein in at the edge of the cliff. If each tool is a puppet, then a big mistake will be made. All postal workers in the three northeastern provinces bow.</p>
<h3>Chinese Workers at the British Yesson Factory</h3>
<p>Refuse to Repair Japanese Warships Dispute</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau dispatched personnel yesterday to mediate. Xinsheng News Agency said that when the Japanese army violently attacked our Nineteenth Route Army, a certain shallow-water warship (with a draft of only three feet) was stranded and damaged on the Liuhe River. It was towed back to Shanghai and ordered the British Swire Shipyard to repair it. Later, because the Chinese workers refused, it was changed to the British Yesson Shipyard for repair. However, all the Chinese workers at the Yesson Factory in Pudong and East Broadway were motivated by patriotism and were unwilling to repair it for the Japanese army to use to attack our army again. They asked the Shipbuilding Industry Union of the Fifth District to negotiate with the foreman. Later, the union sent personnel to negotiate, but the foreman insisted on repairing it, otherwise, due to business relations, workers would have to be laid off, which was fruitless. Yesterday, they had no choice but to ask the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau for instructions. It is reported that Zhao Erchang from the Municipal Party Department and Qiu Peihao from the Social Bureau discussed the matter yesterday afternoon and decided to go to the factory immediately to contact the factory management.</p>
<h3>Weng Zhaoyuan Trains the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan, the commander of the 106th Brigade of the 19th Route Army, has recently been focusing all his efforts on training the volunteer army under his brigade's jurisdiction. He is using the fastest method to train combat techniques. On the one hand, he is paying great attention to discipline to strengthen the combat effectiveness of the volunteer army so that it is no different from the regular army. In addition, the Chaozhou Shanghai Fellow Association donated more than 800 sets of military uniforms. Now the volunteer army of this brigade has made significant progress in both academic and physical training. On the one hand, the format is also brand new. Weng personally observes the exercises every day and gives earnest speeches. He told reporters that he would train the volunteer army into an elite division in the shortest possible time so that the general public would increase their belief in armed self-defense. It is reported that the Iron Blood Army, the Citizens' Volunteer Army, and the Student Volunteer Army are all under the jurisdiction of this brigade. They all had considerable combat achievements when they defended Wusong.</p>

<h3>Zhang Hui, Director of Guangdong Aviation, Comes to Shanghai to Promote Aviation Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>Good Results, Drawing May be Advanced</p>
<p>Zhang Hui, Director of Guangdong Aviation, came to Shanghai from Guangdong last time specifically to expand aviation and promote the aviation lottery tickets he initiated in Guangdong. This aviation lottery has a total value of five million yuan, with three million yuan used to purchase airplanes and two million yuan as prize money. Each ticket costs ten yuan, with a total of fifty thousand tickets, of which five thousand have prizes, averaging one prize per thousand tickets. The first prize winner alone can receive five hundred thousand yuan. Currently, the lottery tickets, in addition to being promoted by the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce and the Aviation Administration, etc., have already sold over three million, with two million remaining. Mr. Zhang brought these to Shanghai, with the support of Sun Ke and other important figures who helped promote them. They are now almost sold out. Therefore, the original drawing date scheduled for September may need to be brought forward.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Representatives Go to Minhang to Comfort Troops Yesterday</h3>
<p>Each Soldier Receives Comfort Items</p>
<p>Lin Yichuan, Ren Zhimei, and Huang Wenkuan, representatives from all sectors of Guangdong to comfort the anti-Japanese soldiers at the front, previously brought cash and a large quantity of goods from Guangdong to Shanghai to reward the troops. Now that their mission is complete, the representatives went to the No. 21 Wounded Soldiers Hospital in Minhang yesterday to comfort the wounded soldiers. They handed over two hundred undershirts, two cans of phoenix tail fish, and two hundred packs of dried tangerine peel to Ms. Wang Suxiang, the hospital director, with each soldier receiving one item.</p>
<h3>British Soldiers Return Guns to the Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Handed Over to the 19th Route Army</p>
<p>The Far East News Agency reports that the Third District Branch of the Municipal Federation's Defense Corps previously had eleven rifles taken by British soldiers. According to a report from the Defense Committee, the eleven rifles, as a result of negotiations between Mayor Wu Tiecheng and the British Consulate, have been handed over to the 19th Route Army. If the corps needs to reclaim them, they can request them from the headquarters of the 19th Route Army.</p>
<h3>Macnaghten Returns to His Country Today</h3>
<p>Major General Macnaghten, the outgoing Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is scheduled to board a ship in Shanghai on the 19th of this month to return to his country.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi Arrives in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Kong Xiangxi was previously ordered to go to Hong Kong to meet with Hu Hanmin. He returned to Shanghai on the 16th aboard the President Coolidge. Originally scheduled to arrive at 10:00 AM yesterday, the ship was delayed by heavy fog and only arrived at 10:00 PM last night. He disembarked at the Bund Customs Wharf and returned to his private residence on Rue de Zikawei for rest.</p>
<h3>Xiong Shihui Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Xiong Shi-hui, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai by early train from Hangzhou the day before yesterday. After getting off the train, he went to his private residence on Avenue Albert for rest. It is said that Mr. Xiong's visit to Shanghai is purely for private matters.</p>
<h3>Lin Youren Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lin Youren, a representative of overseas Chinese associations, was arrested in Singapore, but after rescue efforts by various groups in this city, he was released by the authorities. He arrived safely at his residence in Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to Mr. Lin's words to a Nichinichi Shimbun reporter, after arriving in Singapore, he engaged in propaganda, which greatly inspired our overseas Chinese compatriots. Unexpectedly, this aroused misunderstanding from the authorities, who unjustly detained him. Driven by patriotic heart, he had absolutely no other intentions mixed in it. Unexpectedly, this kind of unexpected difficulty came to this extent. Having endured many hardships, he accepted all sacrifices calmly. Later, through the efforts of various groups and friends, he was finally freed. Although he suffered extremely deep stimulation, he will work even harder for the work of saving the country in the future.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Urge Trial in the Wu Mai Case</h3>
<p>In the case of lawyer Wu Mai being beaten and humiliated, in addition to the fact that he himself petitioned the Shanghai District Court Procuratorate to quickly summon the defendants and file public charges separately, the United Federation of Various Groups and the Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products have also sent letters urging the trial to appease public opinion.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation and Other Groups Issue Declaration on National Crisis Savings</h3>
<p>The Citizens' United Federation and various branch federations issued a declaration saying: The sages have said, "Removing the chimney and moving the firewood does not have the grace, not remembering the great power of prevention; being scorched and burnt is to be a distinguished guest, only knowing the merit of rescuing the urgent." It also said, "If a person has a seven-year illness, it is appropriate to store mugwort for three years to treat it." Their words are difficult to reduce in smallness, but can be used as a metaphor for greatness. Since the September 18th Incident last year until today, people only know that the violent Japanese have acted wantonly, illegally provoked incidents, disregarded justice, violated treaties, and destroyed the entire world's peace. Countless warships, troops, artillery, machine guns, as well as the most advanced bombers, tanks, armored vehicles, smoke bombs, plus 250-pound explosives and the internationally prohibited Dum-Dum poison weapons, they dared to forcibly use the public concession as their main base for combat, aerial bombing, fire lighting the sky, raping women, indiscriminately killing compatriots, damaging culture, burning prosperity, using all means to the extreme. Inhumane acts, all are carried out. Although our army is based on iron-blooded principles, it lacks the tools of victory and cannot resist the elite, which is a key to this loss of territory. Our country has vast land and a large population. If we are not of one heart and one mind, we cannot restrain their ferocity. Our association and others are aware of this, so we initiated the public's voluntary savings association for saving the country. The method is for businesses in various industries to actively and voluntarily save and deposit in nearby Qian Zhuang banks. Today, what is taken from the people is very small, but in the future, it will be used for the country very greatly. If everyone can be of one mind and save together, with the greatness of Shanghai and the prosperity of commerce, in a blink of an eye, it will reach a very large number. The national crisis is urgent; compatriots, wake up quickly. Preparedness prevents trouble; this is the best strategy. We hope that all businesses will comply. China is fortunate. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Those Reporting to the Cadre Training School of the Lixingshe are Quite Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>However, the Procedures are Quite Cautious, Please Pay Attention to Those Applying</p>
<p>The Nanjing Lixingshe is the only organization serving the military in our country. Since its establishment, it has reached four years, and the results are quite remarkable. Recently, the authorities of the society, considering that the country is in trouble and that this is the time for those with ambition to be loyal to the party and the country, the work in the society urgently needs to be expanded. Therefore, they have run a cadre training school since the 15th, enrolling students separately in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu. As of today, a total of five or six hundred copies of the simple regulations and application forms have been taken. However, because the application procedures are quite strict, in addition to the documents that should be prepared in general, it is also necessary to hold an introduction letter or guarantee letter from the principal of the original school or a school that is difficult to graduate from. Therefore, many of those who have gone to apply recently have not been approved because the procedures have not been completed. It is hoped that students who want to take the exam in the future will pay attention to this to avoid wasting time and effort in vain.</p>

<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Yuqing Middle School: The Yuqing Middle School on Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, could not open at the original location this semester due to the war.

<h3>Fee Deduction Dispute at Wuhan University</h3>
<p>The National Wuhan University recently suffered a deduction from the Hankou branch of the Central Bank for its operating expenses disbursed in March. A group was ready to request strike. According to a gentleman from the school yesterday, in January of this year, due to the reorganization of the Ministry of Finance, the operating expenses for December and January were not issued. After the school authorities sat in Shanghai to wait for result, they were introduced by the Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank to prepare 42,500 yuan, with the December receipt of funds from the twentieth year as collateral. Subsequently, due to the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the accumulated debts could not be replenished by even a cent. Even the subsequent expenses were only disbursed at a 30% discount. Unexpectedly, the Central Bank made things difficult, and forcibly withheld the 30% of the Ministry of Finance issued to the school in March. Since the school moved to the new site, the expenses have been tighter, and the original expenses have already been considered insufficient, not to mention merging this 30% without giving it. This is tantamount to cutting off its life. Therefore, the teachers and students of the school are very angry about this and have sent people to Shanghai to negotiate. If there is no result, they fear that they will inevitably resort to a strike.</p>
<h3>The Book Industry Sends Telegram Requesting Exemption from Increased Postage</h3>
<p>The Book Industry Association telegraphed: Nanjing is divided into the National Government Executive Yuan Supervisory Yuan Ministry of Communications Ministry of Education Ministry of Interior Jun Jian, reading the reasons for the increase in postage by Vice Minister Tan of the War Communications Yuan on April 11: "According to statistics, the majority of books are novels, and among novels, the majority are superstitious and obscene novels that hinder culture. The post office loses a huge amount of money every year, and it is unreasonable to transmit propaganda for this type of superstitious and obscene novels that hinder culture and to make profits for book prices without morality." What Vice Minister Chen said and what the statistics said are the majority. What is the basis for this? It concerns the names of booksellers and authors. It should be clearly indicated. Moreover, postage is paid by the buyer, so how can book prices make profits? To go one step further, even if there are superstitious and obscene novels, the competent authorities should punish them separately according to law, which has nothing to do with the duties of the Ministry of Communications. If there are violations, then one cannot allow them to be disseminated by increasing postage, so as to harm society. Moreover, the majority of legitimate booksellers increase book transportation costs, and it is not reasonable to impose taxes on legitimate readers because of illegal books. The increase in book postage this time is as high as two or three times. The government wants to develop the northwest, but now it is stifling its vitality. The government wants to revitalize culture, but now it is hindering its dissemination. The government does not want people in the border provinces to discuss books, so be it. Otherwise, please immediately withdraw the order to increase book postage. The timing is urgent. The Shanghai Book Industry Association, Qiao,</p>

<h3>The Water Police Team of Jiangsu Province Cracked the Lake Bandit Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>Several Accomplices Were Arrested in Shanghai</p>
<p>One Kidnapped Kunshan Victim Was Rescued</p>
<p>Luo Daokun, captain of the third team of the first district of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team, and Xi Lanqing, deputy detective of the district, because the bandit forces in the area of Dianshan Lake have been unusually rampant since the military rebellion, led the entire team of police officers to rush to pursue them on the 15th of last month. They fought fiercely with the bandits. As a result, five bandits were killed and Wang Yuting and others were captured alive, and five kidnapped victims were rescued. It was subsequently found out that Wang Yushan, deputy director of the transportation office of the 19th Route Army, was previously intercepted by bandits while passing through Dianshan Lake by electric boat, shot by three bullets, and died of serious injuries. It was also done by these bandits. According to the confession of the captured bandit Wang Yuting, there are still accomplices carrying kidnapped victims, hiding at No. 1003 Binlang Road and No. 800 Haifang Road in the Shanghai Public Concession. Captain Luo and Deputy Detective Xi came to Shanghai and went to the Gordon Road Police Station in charge of the area at 5:30 the day before yesterday to request assistance in apprehending them. The head detective immediately dispatched West Detective Nankai Er and Chinese Detective No. 176 to go to No. 1003 Binlang Road first. No trace of the bandits was seen, only two leather boxes of clothes and letters and scorebooks were found. In addition to continuing to send detectives to guard the house, the rest went to No. 800 Haifang Road, where they arrested Gu Jiwen (also known as Zhang Shaoqing), Qian Jinsheng (also known as Zhang Guangcai), Guo Jingqing, Qian's mistress Qian Sanbao, and the woman's mother Gu, five people, and rescued a 14-year-old boy, Wang Yingyu, from Kunshan. Until yesterday morning, Detective No. 176, who was guarding No. 1003 Binlang Road, continued to arrest Shen Jinsheng and sent them all to the First Special District Court at 9:00 AM. Xu Pucheng, district chief of the first district of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team, also attended the court to observe. Judge Feng Shide opened the court for interrogation. First, the lawyer Wu Yaotang of the police station described the situation, stating that the evidence in this case was sufficient, and the water police team requested a transfer. The police station did not object. Then, Captain Luo reported on the anti-bandit campaign, and said that although the captured bandits changed their names, their real names were clearly written on the letters and scorebooks found in their houses. He presented the scorebooks to the court for inspection. The rescued kidnapped victim, Wang Yingyu, said that his father was a rich man in Kunshan and was kidnapped in the first month of the year. When asked, the victim Wang Yingyu said that after being kidnapped, he was taken to Shanghai by the bandits by boat. He first lived in Zhabei and then moved to Haifang Road. The bandits who were arrested today were all living together in the bandit's den, and the star of the bandit's den was Zhang Guangcai, who claimed to be Qian Jinsheng. When questioned, Gu Jiwen said that his name was Zhang Shaoqing, not Gu Jiwen. Judge Feng wrote down the question: Now the kidnapped victim is facing you, what else do you have to say? The bandit hung his head and said nothing. When questioned, Qian Jinsheng confessed that the kidnapped victim was sent by a person named Lao Wang. At that time, he said that the child had fled to Shanghai and was staying for a few days, and he did not know that he was kidnapped. When questioned, the remaining bandits made excuses, and the female bandit Qian Sanbao said that she and Gu were mother and daughter, and came to Shanghai to avoid the war. Because she had known Qian Jinsheng for three years, she lived in his house. Finally, the police station lawyer claimed that in addition to the two trunks that were found, a total of 166.4 yuan in cash was found on the defendants. This amount can be handed over to the police team to take away. Judge Feng then ordered the six men and women, including Gu Jiwen, and the seized property to be handed over to the officers to be taken back to the case for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Zhaoshang Xihu Ferry Robbed in Suzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Robbed South of Baodai Bridge</p>
<p>Losses of Approximately 3,000 Gold</p>
<p>Recently, inland river ferries have often encountered bandit robberies, and the area near Suzhou is a frequent haunt of bandits, and many have local accents. Yesterday, the Wuxi-Shanghai ferry of the Zhaoshang Inland River Shipping Bureau, which arrived in Shanghai, was robbed by bandits when it arrived at Fengmen, Suzhou. Even the clothes worn by the passengers were stripped off. The details of this incident are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Dehe Opens from Wuxi to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Zhaoshang Xishen ferry Dehe, dragging a passenger company boat and a Bai Xiang boat, opened to Shanghai at 10:00 AM on the 17th. About 40 miles from Suzhou, the engine of the Dehe suddenly broke down and stopped for repairs. After about two hours, it was repaired and started sailing. At 4:00 PM, the ship arrived in Suzhou. After passengers got on and off as usual, it had to open. However, the Suzhou Bureau suddenly changed the ferry, so it was delayed in Suzhou for five hours before opening.</p>
<h3>Li Hang Substitute Class Encountered Thieves</h3>
<p>Suzhou Branch at</p>
<p>After the Dehe arrived in Suzhou, it was initially heard that a certain army commander wanted to take the ride, so it was guarded for a moment. It was not until 8:00 PM that the passengers on the ship repeatedly questioned the bureau, asking why it had been moored in Suzhou for so long without opening. It was not until 9:00 PM that the Suzhou Bureau transferred the Dehe and changed the Li Hang ferry to drag each passenger ship to Shanghai. It was already late at night. Unexpectedly, the Li Hang was robbed when it arrived at Sanhetang, about six miles south of Baodai Bridge in Fengmen. The waiter on the ship notified the passengers that they must be extra careful, saying that this place was unsafe. Before the words were finished, the bandits came. The Li Hang had to stop and throw the boat. Six bandits, each holding a pistol, boarded the ship. First, two bandits guarded the boss, and the other bandits entered the cabin to search for valuables, forcing the passengers to hand over the silver dollars. All the passengers, more than 300 people, did not dare to resist, and handed over the cash. After the first bandits robbed the silver dollars, more than a dozen bandits came for the second time and began to search for jewelry and luggage. When they saw copper coins, they threw them all over the ground. After the second bandits left, six bandits came for the third time. Because there were no more silver items, they stripped the passengers' clothes. No matter how new or old, they were forcibly taken away. It took about two hours.</p>
<p>It was only then that they left fully loaded.</p>
<h3>Passengers Were Extremely Embarrassed</h3>
<p>When the bandits were robbing, the first two were from Hunan, and the rest were from Suzhou. Moreover, the dress was similar to that of the local people and should be hooligans. The cash loss in the three robberies was about 2,000 yuan, and the jewelry and clothes were about 1,000 yuan. The victims were even stripped of their single shirts and trousers, and even their shoes and socks were taken away. Only the Bai Xiang boat towed behind was not robbed. At noon yesterday, the Li Hang arrived in Shanghai after encountering the bandits. When the ship arrived at the dock, the robbed guests were very embarrassed. They lost both things, leaving only their empty bodies. Many passengers reported to the Zhaoshang Bureau on the spot and requested a thorough investigation of the robbery and assistance to the victims.</p>

<h3>The Case of the Public Justice Printing Press Privately Printing Reactionary Publications Opens for Trial</h3>
<p>On the 30th of last month, the political department of the French Concession Police Station detected that the Public Justice Printing Press at No. 1, Shunqingli, Notre Dame Road, was privately printing communist reactionary propaganda newspapers, which were detrimental to social order. The squad leader Ma Muya (transliteration) went to the printing press at 4:00 PM that afternoon and arrested the manager Peng Zhuoqing, the proofreader Liao Anjian, and 8 people including Jiang Lingen, Zhu Fuyuan, Zhang Gui, Chen Zhaoji, Zhao Binghe, Xu Gengsheng, Zhao Hesheng, and Lu Siquan. They copied 1,500 copies of the Oriental Youth newspaper, 2,000 copies of the Green Workers newspaper, 200 copies of the Fneumda newspaper, and various reactionary text manuscripts and typeset lead and zinc plates, totaling 17 types. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for investigation and detention. Yesterday afternoon, the police station escorted the defendants back to the Third Branch of the High Court. The presiding judge Lu Yimei, together with the two judges Guo Dezhang and Zhang Chaozuo, and Prosecutor Zhang Zongkan, went to the Second Criminal Court for interrogation. The police station was represented by lawyer Gu Shouxu, who prosecuted according to Article 160 of the Criminal Law, Articles 2 and 6 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China, and Articles 19 and 35 of the Publishing Law. Some of the defendants hired lawyer Dong Yu for defense. Because the hearing was closed to the public, it was impossible to record the interrogation. As a result of the trial, the court ordered that the hearing be adjourned to a later date.</p>

<h3>Japanese Military Vehicle Crashes into Rickshaw</h3>
<p>Woman Falls Out and is Seriously Injured</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM on the 17th, a certain Japanese military cargo truck was speeding east on the Waibaidu Bridge, causing a rickshaw traveling east along the sidewalk next to Broadway to be hit violently from behind. The rickshaw driver lost his footing and fell to the ground. Mrs. Zhang, a resident of a certain block in the Eastern District, fell out of the rickshaw, suffering serious head injuries, bleeding from the corner of her right eye, and also injuring her left hand. Seeing that the accident had been caused, the Japanese military vehicle drove away without regard. Many witnesses on the roadside dared to be angry but dared not speak out, and could only let it leave. Later, passersby called Chinese police officers Nos. 2755 and 2780, who sent the injured person to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Wanting Money More Than Life</h3>
<p>Secretly Going to Work in a Japanese Factory</p>
<p>Beaten to Death by the Masses</p>
<p>Japanese factory owners are enticing Chinese workers to resume work with promises of benefits, but Chinese workers are indignant at the Japanese's brutality, so none have returned to work. Unexpectedly, yesterday a Chinese worker named Wang Linsheng from Qingjiang, 21 years old, endured humiliation due to poverty and secretly went to work at the Number 7 Cotton Mill of the Inner and Outer Cotton Mills in Xiaoshadu. As he arrived at the factory gate, he was spotted by zealous patriotic workers who tried to persuade Wang not to serve the Japanese, but Wang refused. Consequently, he was severely beaten by the crowd. Linsheng was no match for them and was knocked down. The assailants scattered. The Putuo Road Police Station was informed and dispatched Chinese and foreign officers to the scene. They transported the injured Wang Linsheng to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, Wang's internal injuries were too severe, and he died en route to the hospital. His body was then sent to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road for examination. An order was issued to arrest the culprits.</p>
<h3>Traitor Committing All Sorts of Evil</h3>
<p>Extorting Money Without Success, Immediately Resorting to Poison</p>
<p>Han Liren, a 51-year-old man from Yancheng residing in a shed at No. 18 Pushan Road, Zhabei, was invaded by twelve Jiangbei traitors on the 15th of this month. They intended to extort five hundred silver dollars from him. Han replied that he had none. As a result, they tied his hands and feet with hemp rope and burned paper soaked in kerosene to scorch his body. They then robbed him of several tens of silver dollars and fled one after another. Han was severely injured and was taken to Baolong Hospital by his wife and others, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died the following morning. The hospital reported to the Xinza Road Police Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The body was then taken to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Li Ying, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Wei Ligong, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the office to examine the body. After taking their seats for the official inquiry, they heard the statement of the deceased's wife, Han Wei, describing the circumstances at the time. Li then announced that the deceased, Han Liren, a male, had indeed been burned to death by robbers before his death. The body was handed over to his wife, Han Wei, to be claimed with a written guarantee for burial.</p>
<h3>Two Midwives Performing Abortions for Pregnant Women</h3>
<p>Wei Wu, Unable to Bear the Pain,</p>
<p>Attempts Suicide by Taking Poison</p>
<p>The woman, Wei Wu, recently became pregnant for three months, and the pregnancy was not by her husband. She eagerly sought a way to terminate it to prevent exposure. She learned that Jin Wang, a local woman at No. 16 Zhifu Road, worked as a midwife and was skilled in performing abortions. On March 18th of this year at 2 PM, she went directly to Jin Wang's place to request an abortion. Jin performed the procedure, and two days later, the fetus was aborted. However, the abdominal pain was severe and became increasingly intense day by day. After a month, she could not bear the suffering any longer. Resentful, she had suicidal thoughts and secretly swallowed a poisonous medicine called "Sanxian Dan," which contained mercury poison, behind people's backs, moaning incessantly. Her cohabiting woman, Wu Cai, noticed and rushed Wei Wu to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The hospital informed the Laoza Road Police Station, which ordered Detective Ye Yusi to investigate and verify the facts. The police arrested Jin Wang the day before yesterday. Jin confessed that Tang She, a 62-year-old woman from Nanxiang, who also worked as a midwife and lived at No. 7 North Fujian Road, was her assistant at the time. The detectives then arrested Tang She and took her to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division One. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the police were prosecuting the two defendants based on Article 305, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law regarding abortion. He recounted the previous events, saying that Wei Wu's lover, Huangzhou Lao Zhu, had initially agreed on an abortion fee of 20 silver dollars, paying 12 silver dollars in advance. After the abortion, because she could not bear the abdominal pain, she swallowed "Sanxian Dan" poison, intending to commit suicide. Although her life was not in danger, she still needed time to recover in the hospital. Therefore, he requested that the case be postponed and submitted a doctor's certificate stating that the medicine Wei Wu ingested contained mercury poison. The defendants then hired lawyers Fan Gang, Fan Qi Sheng, and Wang Liangqing to defend them in court. Jin Wang claimed that Wei Wu came to her for treatment that day, saying she was pregnant. She diagnosed it as amenorrhea, not pregnancy. Wu did not believe her, so she invited Tang Yu to come and jointly diagnose her. It was confirmed that she had amenorrhea, so she told her to take herbal remedies and emmenagogues, and gave her twelve silver dollars, three of which she gave to Tang Yu. She did not perform an abortion or use any medication. Tang Yu testified that Jin Wang had called her to diagnose Wei Wu on March 18th. Wei Wu had amenorrhea because she often argued with her husband and drank cold foods. So she advised her to buy emmenagogues herself and did not perform an abortion. After the court president Qian Hongye verified the statements, he ordered Jin Wang to be remanded in custody. Tang Yu was released on bail by two shopkeepers. The case was adjourned for seven days for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Crowley Sentenced to Two Years of Imprisonment</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that American citizen Crowley was secretly entrusted by American Merchant Marine officer Meik Henry to transport opium to America. This morning, the American Court continued the trial. Crowley admitted to privately transporting fifty-five cans of opium to America. However, he claimed that he had resided in the Far East for eighteen years and did not know that this matter was a serious crime. He had two children who were now without a mother to rely on and depended solely on him for their livelihood. He begged the court for mercy and said that Meik Henry had guaranteed his position on the warship, saying that there was nothing to worry about, and that he also wanted to earn money, so he dared to break the law. Pan, the judge, sentenced him to two years of imprisonment and sent him to the McNeil Island Reformatory in Washington State to reform.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Commits Suicide by Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>Zhu Wenbin, from Jinhua, married Mao, a young woman from Changshu, as his wife in the early winter of last year. Mao was 22 years old this year, but she often suffered from mental disorders. The day before yesterday, she committed suicide by smoking opium due to a minor incident. At 2 PM, her husband found out and sent her to Baolong Hospital for treatment and then brought her home. However, because the opium poison had not been completely removed, the poison relapsed at 6 PM in the evening. She was sent to Baolong Hospital again, but the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 1:30 AM that night. The hospital informed the police station, who took the body to the forensic examination office. Yesterday morning, Wu Xiaoke, a prosecutor from the Second Special Court, was asked to examine the body. It was confirmed that Mao had committed suicide by poisoning before her death. After questioning the husband, he was instructed to collect the body with a written guarantee for burial.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>To the Editor: I was surprised to read the "Cruel Daughter-in-Law Bites Mother-in-Law Case" in the local news section of your newspaper on April 16. It concerns the case of Lao Yu Huang, a local woman living in a bungalow at Kangji Lane, Kangti Road, in the French Concession, and her daughter accusing her eldest daughter-in-law, Yu Zhang, of biting her mother-in-law's lower body first, and then, unsatisfied, sneaking into the old house on the 8th, knowing that her husband's younger brother and sister were accompanying the bride in the hospital. She moved all 48 pieces of makeup and cotton-padded clothing prepared by the younger sister (Cui Bao) (worth 486 silver dollars) to the patio and burned them, and took away all gold, silver, and jewelry (worth 351 silver dollars), fleeing to A Gui's house to hide. I find it very strange. Ma has no special relationship with Yu Zhang, she was just a wedding planner. Otherwise, there has been no contact on weekdays. However, Yu Zhang had a family dispute with her mother-in-law Yu Huang, and Ma had once mediated between the two sides. (Yu Huang is Ma's next-door neighbor, and Kangji Lane is also Ma's property, so she mediated.) But it was ineffective, so she ignored it. Now, reading the newspaper, the report is completely inconsistent with the facts. Ma has been contracting cleaning matters for the British and French concessions in the north and south of the city for decades, and due to old age, she has not asked about outside affairs for a long time. She could have ignored the above matters, and the discussers may laugh. Because the matter involves reputation, I had to file a case with the court and ask you to publish this letter in the news column to correct the record, so that no misunderstandings will arise. This is my greatest hope. Respectfully, to the chief editor of the Shanghai News Editing Department of the Shen Bao. Ma Gui (A Gui) respectfully, under seal, April 18.</p>
<p>To the Shen Bao Editor: I have just read an article in your newspaper about the labor strike at the Qihua Company. The details described in it are inconsistent with the facts. I am writing to request a correction. The Qihua Company owes a considerable amount of wages to its employees. It is only natural for us to seek our owed wages, as we are forced by life's circumstances. We did not strike on the 16th, we only asked the managers Tan Rongyun and Li Peitang for our owed wages on that day. As for saying that we were unwilling to deduct the accounts, that is even more absurd. Our employees did not say or intend this. Moreover, we have already allowed them to deduct the wages that were paid the other day. Furthermore, the liquidator did not list the debts or notify the debtors. He intentionally deducted and did not issue the wages of all employees. From this point of view, they have not sought wages from debtors, so how do they know that the debtors will not allow deductions? All of this is intentionally not paying our owed wages, using excuses to try to avoid it. Now, due to the limited space in your newspaper, we cannot fully argue our case. We have already posted another announcement in front of the Qihua Company. I will not say much more. Respectfully, and best wishes for your health. The Secretariat of the Wage Claiming Group of Qihua Company, April 18.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I was surprised to read your newspaper on the 16th about our company allegedly posing as a Chinese company to seize shipping rights. After investigation, our company was founded purely with Chinese capital and there is no foreign capital involved. All ships are registered with the Ministry of Communications and can be checked with the Ministry's license. This matter concerns the shipping rights of Chinese merchants and hinders the reputation of our company. I fear misunderstandings, so I hereby request a correction. With best regards, Yongyuan Shipping Company in Shanghai, April 18.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team May Leave Ping Tonight</h3>
<p>Special Train as a Borrowing Nature</p>
<p>Continuing to Discuss the Journey Out of the Pass Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>(Beiping) The investigation team held a meeting at the Beijing Hotel at 9:30 this morning to discuss the itinerary out of the Pass. The Japanese representative insisted on the premise of a group division method. The Chinese representative Gu Weijun has received a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, instructing the Beining Railway to accompany the investigation team east, but there are still no concrete results. Lytton visited the Summer Palace this afternoon, accompanied by Zhou Dawen and Tang Baochao and their wives. At the same time, the German and French representatives visited the Forbidden City. (Eighteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is news that the investigation team will depart tomorrow evening. The Japanese side is still responsible for the safety of the area outside the Pass. Regarding the special train sent by the puppet state to welcome them in Yu, because they declared that they would not accept the hospitality of the puppet state, they will not ride it. It is inconvenient to use a special Chinese train to go out of the Pass, so it was decided to still take the special train prepared by the Beining Railway, with the nature of borrowing. (Eighteenth Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese and Japanese Representatives May Take the Sea Route</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The investigation team has completed its work in Ping and plans to take a special Beining train out of the Pass on the 19th evening.

<h3>Special Train Out of the Pass Rented by the Team</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The League of Nations Investigation Team has rented a special train to enter Manchuria, which has been waiting at the station since the team arrived in Ping. Since it is rented, this car is a "League of Nations train," not a Chinese train. It is hoped that this will eliminate a difficulty for the investigation team to enter Manchuria. It is heard that the new government of Manchuria has sent a special train to Shanhaiguan to welcome the investigation team, so the special train in Beiping will probably not go outside the Pass. The investigation team may rent the special train from the new government of Manchuria and the train they take on the Chinese Eastern Railway afterward. It is said that the investigation team may split up, with the Chinese and Japanese escorts taking the route from Tianjin to Dalian to enter Manchuria, while the remaining members taking the route from Shanhaiguan.

<h3>Soviet Union Asks to Recall the Chinese Consul in Hailanpao</h3>
<p>Because the Consulate Sends Telegrams on Behalf of Ma Zhanshan</p>
<p>Sufficient to Disrupt the Non-Interference Policy</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union's Foreign Affairs Commission learned that the Chinese consul in Hailanpao used coded telegrams to transmit his signed petition to China and other places on behalf of General Ma Zhanshan, who is currently escaping to Heilongjiang. However, this move is an abuse of his rights and is sufficient to disrupt the Soviet government's absolute non-interference policy on the Manchurian incident. Therefore, the Foreign Affairs Commission has decided to request the government of Manchuria (?) to recall the current Chinese consul in Hailanpao and replace him with another person. At the same time, the government has telegraphed the Hailanpao authorities to temporarily suspend the sending of telegrams by the Chinese consul. (Eighteenth TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although there are rumors that Japanese-Russian relations are becoming increasingly strained, Russia's request for the government of Manchuria to send a new consul to replace the Chinese consul in Heihe has created a very good impression in Japanese political circles. The Russian authorities did this because the consul used coded telegrams to send telegrams on behalf of Ma Zhanshan. The Japanese authorities declared that this move by the Soviet Union can eliminate rumors of Ma Zhanshan escaping to Russia and can also prevent Chinese officials from continuing to make anti-Japanese propaganda to the League of Nations investigation team.

<h3>White Russians in Harbin Riot at the Chinese Eastern Railway Office</h3>
<p>Thugs Carrying Weapons</p>
<p>Police Do Not Interfere</p>
<p>(Moscow) Local newspapers published a telegram from Beiping stating that the provocative behavior of the White Russians in Harbin has recently increased. Chinese police have repeatedly arrested innocent Soviet citizens, but have not interfered with the White Russians who are carrying out disturbances. On the 16th of this month, more than 400 White Russians marched in a group, broke into the Chinese Eastern Railway office, severely smashed the windows of various departments, and threatened the Soviet warriors of the railway bureau. Then they smashed several internal doors and entered the office of Zykosznysov, the deputy director of the railway bureau. As Mr. Ke was not there, they tore up all the documents and scattered them on the ground and left. According to eyewitnesses, several of the leading thugs were carrying weapons. The telegram also stated that when the White Russian thugs carried out the disturbances, the Chinese police guarding the Chinese Eastern Railway did not stop them or capture them. Before this incident, a thug had assaulted Ke in the middle of the road. Fortunately, Ke escaped in a car, but the police at the scene were all standing by. (Seventeenth TASS Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Russian Bandits of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bombing Bridges Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>One Russian Railway Worker Shot and Killed</p>
<p>Retreated After a Brief Battle with the Escort Soldiers</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to news from Taolaizhao today, seven or eight Russians participated in the recent plot to destroy the Songhua River Bridge. This bridge is between Taolaizhao and the second station of Songhua River. According to police reports, this bridge is guarded by soldiers of Manchuria. Each time a train passes, two railway workers check. On the night the conspiracy to bomb the bridge was discovered, two railway workers were on duty as usual at the end of the bridge, one in the direction of the Songhua River, named Guchensov, a Russian who had become a Chinese citizen, and one in the direction of Taolaizhao, named Gribov. When the freight train from Harbin was about to arrive, Guchensov walked along the bridge, but did not see Gribov return the signal. He was very strange, so he went forward again. Suddenly, he met two Russian bandits with guns, who forced him to follow them. Before long, the freight train arrived. He raised a slow-down signal. When the train was very close to him, he jumped over the tracks. The Russian bandits could not catch up because of the freight train separating them. He then ran to the second station of Songhua River and reported to the Chinese soldiers, so the soldiers immediately went out on patrol. They found Gribov had been shot and killed. Not far away, there were several Russians with guns. The soldiers then shot at them. After a few minutes of fighting, the Russian bandits retreated, leaving behind a lot of explosives next to the bridge. According to experts, the bandits planned to destroy the bridge and prepared for several nights. If it had not been discovered in time, the bridge might have been destroyed that night.

<h3>Case of Japanese Train Overturning</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Sends Personnel to Investigate Again</p>
<p>No Concrete Evidence Has Been Obtained Yet</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Russian authorities of the Eastern Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway Guard Army mutually shirk responsibility for the overturning of the Japanese train. The Japanese side sent personnel to investigate again. (Eighteenth Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Consulate in Harbin reported today that according to the investigation of the derailment of the Japanese military vehicle on the 13th of this month, although there is no concrete evidence, it seems that the tracks were destroyed by the Russian Communist Party. It also said that Soviet Russia has transferred nine divisions of troops to the Far East, so the situation may be more prone to conflict. A government spokesperson said today that Japan is eager to avoid the possibility of conflict with Russia, so Japan does not want to send troops east to Hailin unless absolutely necessary. Judging from the distribution of the Russian army, Russia seems to be preparing for war, but it is defensive rather than offensive. Russia is now increasing the defense force in Sakhalin and hopes to establish defenses there. There are no Japanese troops in that area, so if something happens, the Japanese oil wells will be controlled by the Russians, but there will be no trouble at present.

<h3>Russia-Japan Relations in the Eastern Provinces</h3>
<p>Remarks by the Former Ambassadors of Russia and Japan</p>
<p>(Moscow) Local newspapers have published a dispatch from Peiping concerning remarks made by Tanaka, the former Japanese ambassador to Moscow, to a reporter from a Harbin newspaper. Tanaka is currently in Harbin representing the Japanese Foreign Ministry to investigate the situation. The dispatch stated that Tanaka said, "The purpose of my trip to Manchuria is to investigate the new government and the general state of Manchuria. Manchuria is now gradually moving towards a proper path, although the future will inevitably have some national difficulties, but none of them are of great significance. The relations between the Soviet Union and Japan will not fall into a stalemate. As for the rumors of military conflict between the two countries, they are even more incredible. Regarding the North Sea fisheries issue, Tanaka said that this issue was entirely negotiated in Moscow, and most of the difficulties have been completely resolved, with only a few unimportant points remaining. As for Japan's forest concession rights in the Soviet Sakhalin, they have now expired and been canceled. However, Japanese oil exploration rights in that area are greatly hindered by the local Soviet authorities." (TASS note: Japan has never had any forest concession rights in Sakhalin. As for the Japanese oil exploration rights there, they are proceeding as usual, and the Soviet Union has never interfered with them.) (TASS dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Government Statement to Japan: Northeast Has No Right to Borrow Money</h3>

<h3>Authorities Confer on How to Handle the Shanghai Incident</h3>
<p>Talks between Luo Wengan and Guo Taiqi</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today, at the Central Political Conference, Lin Sen, Wang Jingwei, Jiang Zhongzheng, Wu Jingheng, Jiang Zuobin, He Yingqin, and Chen Mingshu were all present. Luo Wengan was absent. They discussed how to handle the Shanghai Incident, which lasted for a long time. The matter is confidential and no details were disclosed. Before his departure today, Guo Taiqi met with Luo at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and had a long talk about the Shanghai Conference. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Guo Taiqi and Huang Qiang returned to Shanghai on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. liner at 5 PM on the 18th. According to Guo before his departure, the Shanghai Conference was convened based on the resolution of the League of Nations. However, due to the Japanese side creating unnecessary complications, the conference was stalled. Whether it will be reopened in the future depends on the progress of the League of Nations Special Committee. However, since the Japanese side is unreasonable, the future of the conference is unlikely to be optimistic. The ambassadors of friendly countries are still in Shanghai, so I am also returning to Shanghai by ship today to contact them on all matters. Representative Yan has been sending telegrams to Nanjing for several days, but they are about requesting instructions on various issues. There is no specific report on the situation of the League of Nations. As for the issue of the Round Table Conference, this proposal was originally in the Peng's mediation method and was accepted by our side. However, the Shanghai Conference is limited to military matters and will absolutely not discuss politics, so the Round Table Conference issue was not involved. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo told a reporter from a certain news agency on the 18th that the issue of Gu's entry into customs concerns the entire action of the League of Nations Investigation Team. No party can refuse, and the Japanese side must take responsibility for its safety under the current situation in the Northeast. The Central Government has telegraphed Zhang Xueliang to discuss the matter with the Investigation Team, and a decision should be made within a few days. As for the date and route of the Investigation Team's entry into customs, we are currently awaiting instructions from the League of Nations, which should be completed in about one or two days. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a telegram from our delegation stating that due to the short amount of time, the Investigation Team plans to take the route from Shanhaiguan to Dagushan to Tongliao, and then take the South Manchurian Railway to Harbin, before returning to Shenyang, which will save time. The location for the Investigation Team's rest and drafting of the final report has not yet been determined. During the meeting of the League of Nations Special Committee, we should trust the League of Nations and wait patiently for a resolution. On the one hand, we should seek various ways to increase the League of Nations' guarantees for those who uphold the Covenant. We believe that the League of Nations will use its wisdom to resolve this long-standing Sino-Japanese dispute and impose appropriate sanctions on those who violate all covenants in order to eliminate the scourge in the Far East and maintain world peace. However, we should not abandon our own efforts simply because we have the guarantee of the League of Nations. As for whether the ceasefire conference can be reopened recently, we should wait for the League of Nations to make a statement before deciding. However, the representatives of friendly countries are still working hard to mediate. Regarding the two issues of the Northeast and Shanghai, we should weigh the importance and determine the order of resolution. For example, if one suffers from a sore, one large and one small, and they are treated at the same time, the small one will naturally heal first. Although the large one has not yet healed, the pain can be reduced. We cannot prevent the small one from healing first simply because the large one has not yet healed. However, the will of the government and the people is to hope that the Liaoning and Shanghai incidents can be resolved at the same time. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

In the afternoon at 4 PM, the students held another general meeting. The mood was high, and they were determined not to stop until they achieved their goal of driving Huang away. The meeting continued until 8 PM and had not yet adjourned. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Meeting of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Leading Principles Still Not Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Amendments to the Step-by-Step Reduction Plan</p>
<p>Few Responded to China's Proposal</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 18th - After the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference met today, the representatives began talking about the issue of holding another conference in a few years in just a few minutes. As for the leading principles of this conference, no agreement was reached at today's meeting. Although several representatives spoke, they only delivered grand eloquence, strongly arguing that it is necessary to convene several conferences to gradually reduce armaments.</p>
<h3>Stimson Missed the Meeting Due to a Cold</h3>
<p>Today's General Commission was convened at 10:17 AM. When the representatives entered the venue one after another, a tense atmosphere was already evident in the venue. Representatives and attendees were eagerly awaiting the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Stimson. Chairman Henderson waited near the door, but only Gibson was seen arriving after more than ten minutes, so he returned to the chairman's seat. Mr. Gibson reported that Stimson was unable to attend due to a cold, and the meeting officially began.</p>
<h3>Put Forward the Basic Principles of the German-Turkish Proposal</h3>
<p>Chairman Henderson asked the representatives to express their opinions on the principles for guiding the conference, hoping to obtain a feasible basis for global disarmament. He also put forward the principles proposed by the German and Turkish representatives, advocating that the conference should adopt a simple and grand convention to completely solve the disarmament problem, claiming that if this principle is rejected by the assembly, then the conference will follow the principle of gradual reduction to carry out the work. German representative Nadolny spoke first, proposing that compulsory disarmament should be the guiding principle of the conference, claiming that if there is sincerity and faithful willingness to seek disarmament, then what Germany has done, other countries should follow. He then tried his best to describe the propriety of the German-Turkish proposal, persuading the representatives to abandon selfish national policies, take genuine disarmament as the only aspiration, and jointly promote the progress of the conference, declaring that if we today only reaffirm the existing disarmament foundation and have no other achievements, we will violate the purpose and spirit of the League of Nations charter. German Chancellor Brüning also did not attend the meeting, so Mr. Nadolny spoke.</p>
<h3>Joint Proposal of Six Small Countries</h3>
<p>Next was the joint proposal of the representatives of Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Nicaragua, Denmark, and Estonia, advocating gradual reduction of armaments, believing that the implementation of Article 8 of the charter is the only way, stating that disarmament can only be carried out in stages, with continuous amendments in the shortest possible time. Then France put in great effort to support this proposal, and Poland also strongly defended it. The German representative then requested that this resolution be amended.</p>
<h3>Litvinov's Speech Contained Irony</h3>
<p>Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov also took the stage to speak, ridiculing the representatives who advocated a gradual disarmament plan, saying with a smile that this conference should not first achieve success in the path of disarmament as a starting point for efforts, and then transfer most of the work to the second and third conferences.</p>
<p>Then British Foreign Secretary Simon spoke, expressing agreement with the idea of reopening the conference and making constant amendments, but said that this conference must have some real achievements, claiming that we should not spend this long day in Geneva year after year.</p>
<h3>China Proposes Complete Disarmament</h3>
<p>Next, the Chinese representative took the stage and put forward a plan for complete disarmament, which was more radical and grand than anything contributed by any other representative, shocking the audience. The Chinese representative advocated that the conference should determine the armaments that each country should have, giving serious consideration to the truly important elements of a country's national defense and stipulating the minimum limit required for its appropriate defense, claiming that a country's armaments should be based on the size of the national territory, the number of people, the length and nature of the border, and the domestic resources, and the convenience of its land, sea, and air transportation, and the degree of security against foreign aggression should also be considered. This Chinese proposal took into account both moral and material aspects, not only advocating the abolition of certain armaments, but also wanting to create a practical plan to promote spiritual disarmament throughout the world, saying that the current governments of the world have failed to seek disarmament from the psychological and moral aspects, and therefore there are still those who support narrow nationalism and try their best to cultivate the warlike spirit of the people. As for the material aspect, they advocated abolishing all aggressive weapons such as battleships, submarines, aircraft carriers, heavy artillery, all military aircraft, and all chemical and bacteriological warfare.</p>
<h3>The Step-by-Step Reduction Plan Dominates</h3>
<p>However, many in the meeting agreed to gradually reduce armaments, and few responded to the radical proposals of China and Germany. Japan, Switzerland, France, Poland, Sweden, England, Italy, Persia, and the Netherlands successively took the stage and all agreed to the joint proposal of the six small countries. Germany, Turkey, and the Soviet Union all requested that this joint proposal be amended before it was put to a vote. Chairman Henderson then transferred the proposal to the drafting committee to revise the text and adjourned the meeting at 12:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Stocks Plunge</h3>
<p>Telecommunication Agency, Tokyo, 18th - The Japanese financial world is expecting the Bank of Japan to cut interest rates, but Japan's domestic and foreign financial situation is deteriorating day by day. The stock market was dominated by sellers again today. The Tokyo stock market initially showed low prices, and in the afternoon, cotton yarn, raw silk, and major stocks continued to fall sharply. The recent sharp drop in the shares of Tokyo New Stocks was the most severe, reaching a low of 138 yen. Compared with the peak of buying after the gold embargo, which was 179.9 yen at the end of November, it has fallen by nearly 40 yen.</p>

<p>Important Foreign Telegrams Two</p>
<h3>Stimson Meets with Brüning</h3>
<p>Thorough Discussion of Disarmament and Other Issues</p>
<p>Anglo-American Views on Foreign Policy Are Close</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 17th - U.S. Secretary of State Stimson had a long talk with German Chancellor Brüning and Undersecretary of State Pürlo this evening. Since Stimson arrived in Europe, this was the third time he had met with the authorities of major countries separately. The first time was a long talk with French Prime Minister Tardieu in Paris, and the second time was a lunch chat with British Foreign Secretary Simon this afternoon. According to official reports, Stimson and Brüning thoroughly discussed disarmament and various urgent economic issues tonight, exchanging their respective governments' policies and wills. Tomorrow, Brüning will continue to meet with British Foreign Secretary Simon, Italian Foreign Secretary Grandi, and Danish Foreign Secretary Munch to discuss this matter.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 18th - Today, officials claimed that U.S. Secretary of State Stimson and British Foreign Secretary Simon talked for two hours on Saturday, covering all issues, including the Far East dispute. The result of the talks showed that Anglo-American viewpoints on the issues to be decided were completely in agreement. Simon visited German Chancellor Brüning today.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Geneva, 18th - This afternoon, it was learned that Stimson's cold has greatly improved and that he will be able to meet with Italian Foreign Secretary Grandi tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Polish Finance Minister Goes to France</h3>
<p>Domestic Industries on the Verge of Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Will Borrow Huge Sums from France</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Warsaw, 18th - Polish Finance Minister Grün suddenly went to Paris today, likely related to the plan to borrow huge sums from France again, so the financial world is paying great attention. It is said that Poland will be unable to maintain itself without borrowing, because although the country is an agricultural country, it can resist economic decline for a little longer than a purely industrial country, but domestic industries are on the verge of bankruptcy. The major industries are feeling especially poor because the National Bank recently refused to discount Soviet bonds. For example, some factories in Upper Silesia only have enough cash to cover a few days of expenses. It is now expected that France may take the opportunity to propose harsher conditions, but Poland will face a serious crisis without prompt assistance.</p>
<h3>Match King Forged Italian Treasury Bills</h3>
<p>Formally Confirmed by Italian Authorities</p>
<p>France Suffers Huge Losses</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Rome, 17th - Today, local authorities formally confirmed that forged Italian treasury bills with a face value of 21 million pounds were found in the assets of the Kreuger Company. It is said that the counterfeit bills bear the forged signature of former Italian Finance Minister Boselli, but it is extremely clumsy. Those who regularly trade international bonds cannot be deceived. Furthermore, Italy and Match King Kreuger have never had any financial relationship. Around 1930, Kreuger contacted the Italian government to provide huge loans in order to obtain a match monopoly, but the Italian government immediately rejected it.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Amsterdam, 17th - The chief financial columnist for Telegraph newspaper today discussed the recent developments of the Kreuger &amp; Toll Company and estimated that French people purchased more than 500 million francs worth of shares in the company and its subsidiaries. Therefore, after Sweden, France may suffer the heaviest losses.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Opening of Lithuania Case</h3>
<p>Hague, 17th (National Dispatch) - Today, the office of the President of the International Court of Justice announced that the case of the four signatory countries of the Memel Convention against the Lithuanian government will be publicly tried on June 22nd. The plaintiffs in this case are the governments of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan, accusing Lithuania of violating the Memel Convention by using coercive measures to force the Memel Parliament to organize an administrative committee. The Parliament refused, and was subsequently dissolved.</p>
<h3>Closing of the International Trade Union Congress</h3>
<p>Geneva, 17th (Havas) - The International Trade Union Congress, which studied the problems of economic panic and unemployment, has concluded. It was decided to issue a declaration stating that, in addition to the 21 national trade union federations that have joined the International Trade Union Federation, the trade union federations of Norway, Portugal, Ireland, South Africa, India, Japan, and Cuba have also declared their complete agreement with the aims of the International Trade Union Federation in order to alleviate the economic panic. The Secretary-General of the International Trade Union Federation, Mr. Sjöström, delivered a closing speech, earnestly urging all national trade union federations to firmly adhere to the guidelines set by the International Trade Union Federation and to continue to strive for the liberation of workers.</p>
<h3>Great Flood in Yugoslavia Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>Belgrade, 18th (National Dispatch) - A great flood in southern Yugoslavia has caused a disaster, with thousands of houses submerged and residents homeless. The authorities have come up with a surprising plan to use bomber planes to drop bombs and destroy dikes, hoping to spread the flood more widely in order to reduce the water's force. However, some farmers do not agree with this measure and have fired at the planes, although there have been no reports of damage to the aircraft.</p>
<h3>New Zealand Sailors Prepare to Strike</h3>
<p>Auckland, 18th (Reuters) - It is rumored today that sailors may announce a strike immediately. Although the city is quiet at the end of the week, troublemakers are still lurking everywhere, so people are still very panicked. Shopkeepers are now requesting compensation from the government for the losses of shattered glass windows and stolen goods, which are said to total around £40,000.</p>
<h3>Zeppelin Airship Flies to South America</h3>
<p>Friedrichshafen, 17th (National Dispatch) - The second flight of the Graf Zeppelin airship, delayed by two days, started its third flight today and has resumed its original schedule. It departed from here at 0:05 this morning, bound for Pernambuco, Brazil, and is expected to arrive the day after tomorrow, and return on the 22nd, arriving back here on the 25th. After one more flight, the tropical rainy season will begin, and the flights will be temporarily suspended, to resume in the autumn.</p>
<p>Important News</p>
<h3>League of Nations and Japan Heading for Direct Conflict</h3>
<p>Britain and the United States Take the Same Stance on the Puppet State</p>
<p>The U.S. Will Close its Embassy in Tokyo</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Geneva - The Committee of Nineteen has already met, and the future of the Sino-Japanese problem is expected to undergo major developments. The central point of the issue is that, formally, Article 15 of the Covenant will be applied to deal with the Manchurian Incident. However, it is difficult to predict what attitude the League of Nations will actually take. However, Secretary-General Drummond has already stated to Representative Sato that the Manchurian problem must be dealt with under Article 15 of the Covenant. Furthermore, with U.S. Secretary of State Stimson actively involved in Geneva and the Chinese representative flying the flag of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Manchurian problem will undoubtedly turn into a major drama. Although Stimson has not made a clear statement, his attitude is expected to shift with the situation. Therefore, fundamental problems are likely to arise in Manchuria. In particular, Japan's direct conflict with the League of Nations over the application of Article 15 is becoming increasingly urgent. On the other hand, what is most noteworthy is that when the United States adopts a tough stance towards Japan, Britain will also follow suit and adopt the same approach. In this way, Britain and the United States are bound to stand on a common front against Japan. Moreover, U.S. Deputy Foreign Minister Ito Taisho answered questions in the Lower House, and decided not to recognize Manchuria as an independent country, so the gloomy future of Manchuria is already expected.</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Washington - U.S. Secretary of State Stimson has submitted a budget reduction proposal to the Senate, intending to close embassies and consulates abroad. Although he has not yet specified which countries or locations will be affected, it is reported that the embassy in Tokyo is also among those to be closed.</p>
<h3>Japanese to Add Consulates in Northeast China</h3>
<p>And Add Police Stations Along the South Manchuria Railway</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence - In order to realize its concrete plan to invade Northeast China, the Japanese are now preparing to establish consulates in Dunhua, Ningguta, Tao'an, and Hailun, and consular branches in Fuyu, Yimianpo, Mao'ershan, (Linjiang) Sanxing, Muling, and five other locations. In addition, they will also add eleven police stations along the South Manchuria Railway. This matter was approved by the Japanese Cabinet last month and has been actively pursued by the Foreign Ministry. Currently, Foreign Ministry Commissioner Tanaka Tokichi has been dispatched to inspect various places in the Eastern Provinces and handle the establishment of the consulates. All consulates, branches, and police stations are scheduled to be established one after another in mid-month. The annual budget is estimated at ten million, which Foreign Minister Yoshizawa has obtained the understanding of various cabinet members. This funding will be formally added to the budget plan.</p>
<h3>Investigation Team Reports Situation from Nanjing (8)</h3>
<p>Appendix: The League of Nations' Handling of the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>The Chairman's declaration stated that, in order to maintain world peace and promote the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Executive Yuan unanimously resolved to send personnel to Manchuria for on-site investigation. The content of this resolution is explained in detail in sections: The first section of the resolution reaffirms the validity of the resolution unanimously passed by the Executive Yuan on September 30, insisting that Japanese troops should withdraw to within the South Manchuria Railway line within the shortest possible period under the conditions stipulated in that article. The Executive Yuan attaches great importance to this resolution and hopes that both governments can earnestly implement it. The second section expresses deep regret that the situation that occurred after the previous adjournment of the Executive Yuan was even more serious and caused legitimate concern to all parties. Therefore, both parties should immediately restrain themselves and avoid the recurrence of warfare and any actions that would expand the dispute. The fourth section requests that the governments of other countries report to the League of Nations at any time on the situation reported by their representatives in Manchuria, as past experience has proven that such information is of great use. Countries that currently have such representatives stationed in Manchuria should maintain the status quo and strive to increase their effectiveness. The governments of the aforementioned countries should also continue to engage with the Chinese and Japanese governments so that the Chinese and Japanese governments can at any time request their local representatives to work in a certain location. The fifth section states that the investigation team to be dispatched is of a consultative nature and has extremely broad powers. In principle, the team's powers extend to all matters that hinder international relations and Sino-Japanese peace, or upon which Sino-Japanese peace depends, and they may all be studied. The governments of China and Japan may also request the investigation team to study all issues. The team may also freely select all issues as materials for reporting to the Executive Yuan. When necessary, it may report special circumstances to the Executive Yuan at any time. When the investigation team arrives at its destination, if the two parties have not yet implemented the resolution of September 30, the team should report the situation to the Executive Yuan. If the two parties are directly involved in issues related to military affairs, the team cannot interfere, but the team can of course act freely in collecting information for reporting purposes. The meaning of the explanation of the fifth section in the Chairman's declaration, which was not clearly stated in the resolution, is that (1) the provision that the two governments may request the team to study all issues is to satisfy Japan's investigation of our country's anti-Japanese boycott movement and demands, because the Japanese representative requested that this meaning be included in the resolution, which was opposed by our country's representative; (2) the provision that when the team arrives at its destination, if the two parties have not yet implemented the resolution of September 30, the team should immediately report the situation to the Executive Yuan is because our country gave up the demand for a deadline for troop withdrawal and intended to indirectly stipulate a deadline for troop withdrawal in the resolution, which was opposed by the Japanese representative, so it was included in the Chairman's declaration.</p>
<p>In practice, this resolution only reiterates the validity of the September 30 resolution. However, from September 30 to December 10, more than two months have passed. During this period, Qiqihar and many railways have been occupied by Japanese troops. The result of this meeting is only to send an investigation team. Although the effectiveness of this team is difficult to predict at present, the fact has proven that it is a delaying tactic for Japan. The team's work cannot be completed in less than six months. During this time, Japan's various facilities in the Eastern Provinces can be completed, and the great powers will be helpless.</p>
<p>C. Attitudes of Various Countries</p>
<p>(1) Great Powers After Japan detained the Eastern Provinces' salt tax, which had nothing to do with the lives and property of Japanese residents, and captured Qiqihar, the governments of Britain, France, the United States, and other countries knew that Japan's so-called self-defense was just a pretext, and the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant had been completely destroyed. If China and Japan were small European countries, the League of Nations would have issued an order to attack long ago, and Japan would have withdrawn its troops automatically before the order was even issued. However, Japan is a powerful country in the Far East, and the victim is China, a country on the verge of internal strife and political collapse. Therefore, the great powers believe that if they force Japan, a madman, to abide by the law, it will harm themselves. China is a prodigal son, and is it worth sacrificing for? It's better to just wait and see. This was the attitude of the great powers at the time.</p>
<p>However, since Japan violated the Executive Yuan's resolution of September 30, the so-called reputation of the empire, which has always valued morality, has been completely lost, and its hideous face has been exposed to the world. Therefore, Japan's only hope lies in a final struggle. Unless the great powers intervene militarily or our country recognizes its annexation of Manchuria, there is no other way to stop its barbaric actions. Speaking of the issue of military intervention, on the surface, it seems that the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations can pass a resolution based on Articles 15 and 16 of the Covenant, and then order its 50 member countries to cooperate with the United States to take military action against Japan. However, in reality, it is a very complex and difficult problem to solve if the great powers are to make significant sacrifices for this, because the United States has not yet joined the League of Nations. Therefore, if something happens in the Far East, Britain will bear the brunt. Moreover, at that time, the League of Nations was still discussing the Sino-Japanese dispute within the scope of Article 11. According to the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, all resolutions must be approved by both parties. In legal terms, the resolution of September 30 did not stipulate a deadline for troop withdrawal, and the draft resolution of October 24 was not recognized by Japan, so Japan had no obligation to implement it. Therefore, the British and French governments believed that it was fortunate that peace had been maintained, and hoped that when the investigation team's work was completed, China and Japan could reach a reasonable compromise so that Japanese troops could eventually withdraw. In this way, the League of Nations could barely maintain its image, and the great powers could avoid making sacrifices.</p>
<p>Since Britain and the United States had this plan, the other countries, such as France and Italy, were happy to follow. As a result, although Japan's tyranny was even worse than at the previous meeting, the great powers had reached the point where they could not advance any further except by using force to maintain the Covenant. Therefore, their attitude changed from being cowardly to being fearful.</p>
<p>(2) Small Countries As for the small and weak countries, because their position is different from that of the great powers, and the only obstacle to the integrity of their own territory lies in the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, they all hope that the great powers can thoroughly resolve the current Sino-Japanese dispute. However, because they themselves have no real power and only hope for the sacrifices of the great powers, they find it difficult to speak out. Therefore, except for the eloquent Spanish representative, the other representatives are all silent. This is regrettable. (The End)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Bandits Invade Southern Fujian Again</h3>
<p>One Group Takes the Route of Ruijin into Tingzhou</p>
<p>Fujian Troops Are Jointly Suppressing Them with Guangdong Troops</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence - After the Jiangxi bandits were jointly suppressed by the Guangdong troops under Yu Hanmou, they fled from Ganzhou to the Yudu Ningdu area, and also sent another group to take the route of Ruijin into the Fujian Province's Tingzhou Ninghua to obtain food. The Fujian troops stationed in Ninghua under Ma Hongxing have therefore retreated to Songxi, closely deploying defenses, and Lu Xingbang has telegraphed Zhang Zhen, requesting him to order his troops to cooperate in defense and prevent them from consolidating the area. Liu Heding has also successively telegraphed the two brigade commanders Zhou Zhiqun and Gui Zhenyuan, ordering them to take special precautions. On the 10th, the scouts of the Liu division reported that the bandits in Changting were also planning to advance on Longyan from Shanghang and flee to Zhangzhou. On the 11th, the Zhang division also received a similar report, and immediately ordered Yang Fengnian to take extra precautions, and telegraphed the provincial government and the Guangdong troops under Huang Renhuan, requesting them to advance urgently. One account says that a small number of bandits were discovered at Daxiao Pond on the border of Shanghang, Yongding, and Longyan on the 10th, and came into contact with the forward posts of the Zhang division. The bandits in the rear are still planning to move south. The troops under Sun Lianzhong in Changting are concentrated outside Tingzhou and have not yet cooperated with the Red Bandits. As for the Guangdong troops under Huang Renhuan, they have been concentrating in various places in Guangdong Province, such as Dabu and Jiaoling, and can attack Wuhang within a few days, and then attack Changting from Wuhang to reach Ruijin, with the aim of attacking Yudu in conjunction with the First Army troops entering Jiangxi. According to the reports of Yang Fengnian, the brigade commander of Zhang Zhen's division, Yongding, Longyan, and Liancheng counties are currently peaceful. (April 9)</p>
<h3>Phenomena in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi</h3>
<p>The Shanghai War Has a Very Pessimistic Impact on the Porcelain Industry's Future</p>
<p>All Factories Have Not Resumed Work Due to Troop Transfers</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence - Jingdezhen is located in the northeastern part of Jiangxi Province, bordering southern Anhui to the north and western Zhejiang to the east. Geographically speaking, it is actually the屏藩(bastion/barrier) of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Since the Song Dynasty, it has been famous for its porcelain production. For more than a thousand years, it has been known as a porcelain industrial area, with more than 200,000 workers. It was attacked and captured by bandits three times in the past two years, resulting in tens of millions in losses to industry and commerce, reaching a state of bankruptcy. In recent years, the 55th Division has been stationed there, and the bandit atmosphere has been slightly suppressed, and the market has gradually recovered. However, with the outbreak of the Shanghai War, financial stagnation has greatly affected the town's porcelain industry. In addition to a small number of porcelain merchants in Tianjin, Hong Kong, and other places, most others have hesitated to come. As a result, the town's industry and commerce have been virtually suspended, and the city's economic difficulties have reached an extreme point. The sources of funds for education, industry, and other expenses have all fallen through. Last month, the industrial and commercial circles, in view of this, held a meeting to discuss relief measures, intending to quickly urge the factories to resume work, and at the same time, the Chamber of Commerce would borrow money from the banking community in Shanghai to tide over the workers' lives. According to the town's custom, all factories start work on the first day of the third month of the lunar calendar. All workers who come to the town to work, regardless of whether work has started or not, will have their food costs borne by the employers from the first day of the third month of the lunar calendar. Therefore, many workers only bring travel expenses. This year, in the midst of efforts to provide relief, the 55th Division suddenly received orders to return to Anhui. The people of the town feared that the bandits would take advantage of the vacancy and return, and were all extremely panicked. As a result, the factories did not dare to resume work, and the entire town was plunged into a state of panic. The industrial and commercial circles specially appointed Lai Qing and Shi Wenmo as representatives to petition the central and Jiangxi provincial high-level authorities, requesting that the 55th Division not be transferred until the replacement troops had been designated, in order to maintain security, so that the town's 200,000 workers would not lose their jobs and be incited by the Red Bandits.</p>
<h3>Wuhu's Relief Efforts for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>All Circles Organize Financial Maintenance Association</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence - The County Water Conservancy Engineering Committee is currently facing the fact that more than 100,000 disaster victims in the four rural areas are without clothing or food, and urgently needs to seek relief. It was previously planned to collect deeds worth one million, which would be transferred to the rice merchants through the Chamber of Commerce to borrow 50,000 piculs of rice for the disaster-stricken farmers, to be repaid with principal and interest after the autumn harvest. However, due to the importance of the matter, it was decided to convene a joint meeting of party, government, military, police, gentry, and business circles at the county government on the 17th of this month to discuss the measures. If this measure is implemented, the disaster victims in the entire county can maintain their food supply for 100 days.</p>
<p>Since the Wuhu city suffered a flood last year, followed by the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the financial situation has been extremely difficult, and most businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy. In order to provide financial relief and maintain the market, the Wuhu County Chamber of Commerce convened a joint meeting of all circles on the 13th, and decided to organize a Financial Maintenance Association. It was stipulated that the committee would consist of 15 members, two recommended by the banking community, one from the money shops, seven from various industries, and one each from the party, government, military, and police. Chen Houer and Hu Dongchen were appointed to draft the organizational outline, and it was decided to hold a second meeting of all circles on the 16th to present and implement it.</p>
<p>The Xiehe Company's Shenglong small steamer, which runs between Datong and Wuhu, departed from Datong to Wuhu on the morning of the 13th. When it arrived near Daxin Island, it was suddenly surrounded and robbed by more than 30 bandits, resulting in a total loss of about 10,000 yuan in cash, gold bars, and drafts.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Prices Jump Violently by Twelve Taels</h3>
<p>Breaking Through the 700 Taels Mark - Yesterday's gold market was quite good, rising sharply and resisting declines, sometimes hovering around one or two taels. However, the high and low prices for the entire day differed by more than thirteen taels, and finally rose sharply by twelve taels. Initially, it was not moved by the slight rise in the silver market and was able to stand firm. Later, the exchange rates secretly deviated, and because large buyers' demand exceeded supply, it suddenly broke through 710 taels. Buyers in the after-hours market were more active, and both British and American exchange rates rose, so it also shrank by half a position. As a result, the market's momentum actually broke through 720 taels. It is said that the British silver and gold may decline this morning (19th). The details of the market before and after the market are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Opening Was Still Stable - The market opened in the early morning for June, slightly adding 0.7 taels to 708 taels. The big article silver report yesterday was 16/5 points higher, but the U.S. silver only rose by 1/4, and private telegraphs showed that the forward prices actually fell, so people's hearts were firm. Next was 10 taels, which was first advanced by Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Hongkangyong, etc. Soon after, Zhifeng, Yongshunli, and Lailai came out, and immediately lost to 07 taels and 7 qian. However, Kaitai, Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongyuanheng, etc. bought in, and immediately rose by 3 taels to 10 taels and 8 qian. At first, British gold had no honor or disgrace, and 1825 could be used for both entry and exit in April and June. Also, U.S. gold was 31.6875 yuan in April and May, and then returned by slightly more than two taels. At 9:30, HSBC listed British gold at 125 points higher and U.S. gold at 25 points higher, so it rose from 10 taels to 08 taels and 5 qian. China-Belgium absorbed U.S. gold for July at 875, but British gold still settled at 125. Shortly after, there was a slight buying in, at 09 taels and 5 qian. Zhifeng, Yongda, Decheng, Yiyu, etc. sold out, and when it was almost 10 o'clock, it was 07 taels and 2 qian. At this time, U.S. gold for May was settling at 625. Later, the wheat houses absorbed 875 for July, but British gold was only calculated at 8辦士(bàn shì - a unit of measurement in Shanghai). Therefore, the market skyrocketed, and after Fuyu, Yuanheng, Yifeng, Daxingyong, and Mr. Wu and others rushed to buy, the price jumped by six or seven taels, suddenly breaking out of 10 taels, reaching 14 taels at 11:15. By contrast, U.S. gold for April only settled at 4375, and British gold settled at 1.79375. After half past, Yuhe, Hengyu, etc. took the opportunity to sell, so it decreased to 12 taels. In a flash, it improved by more than one tael to 13 taels and 3 qian. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 12 taels and 9 qian, and the quotation was changed to 768 taels, with an estimated 60 taels pressed. The noon closing was 54.5 taels.</p>
<p>The After-Hours Market Actually Had Great Momentum - The market opened in the after-hours market at 14 taels and 2 qian, and then from 13 taels and 8 qian to 14 taels and 7 qian, Dadecheng bought in. Soon after, it retreated to 13 taels and 2 qian. In an instant, British gold for June was doing 8辦士(bàn shì - a unit of measurement in Shanghai). Then various houses offered 6/7辦士(bàn shì - a unit of measurement in Shanghai) at 9375. Then, Mitsui advanced U.S. gold for June at 4375, and also advanced 3125 for May. Yuanmao, Yonghong, Kangyong, Zhifengyong, Fuyuyi, Yifengyong, etc. came to buy in, and the price soared, and when it was close to 3 o'clock, British gold changed to shrinking 125, and U.S. gold 25, but the internal was especially strong, and British gold was only calculated at 8125, and U.S. gold for July was 31.5 yuan, so this rose to 20 taels and 5 qian. After entering, Zhifengyong, Yuanhengyuan, Dayong and others took the opportunity to spit out, so it also fell sharply by more than two taels. After 3:30, it was 18 taels. Then U.S. gold for May was 1875, and Hongkangyong and others bought in again. At 4:00, it was again 20 taels and 5 qian. After ten minutes, it retreated to 18 taels and 7 qian because retail investors sold out. Dadecheng came out and re-entered, and Xixingyong and others chased in, so it was lifted up by more than four taels again to 20 taels and 3 qian. China-Belgium offered British gold for July at 8125. By the time the market closed at 4:30, it was 19 taels and 2 qian. Zhifengyong sold out, and compared to last Saturday, it rose by 11 taels and 9 qian. According to the whole day's maximum of 20 taels and 5 qian and minimum of 07 taels and 2 qian, there was an increase or decrease of 13 taels and 3 qian. The quotation was changed to 774 taels, with an estimated 54.5 taels pressed. The recording shows that the double settlement price was 17 taels to 13 taels in the morning and 23 taels to 19 taels in the afternoon. The water added up to 17 taels in the afternoon and 23 taels, and the bare bars added up to 7 taels because the drop in the period has been reduced to about 3 taels.</p>
<p>Large Investors Striving to Buy In - Statistics of Over-the-Counter Transactions - Daxingyong, Qianchangxiang, Yuantai, Hongkangyong, Wanxing, Yifeng, Yuanheng, and Yifengyong all bought in.

<h3>From Easing to Tightening of Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Quotation First Increases, Then Decreases</p>
<p>Active Trading, Chinese Merchants Mostly Buy, Few Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday was Monday, and as usual, overseas silver markets wired their quotations. Before the HSBC quotation, it first eased and then tightened, so the market situation went from easy to tight. In the early morning, British gold increased by 1.25, US dollars increased by 0.25, Hong Kong decreased by 1.25, and the rest generally increased. By 3 p.m., it had further contracted. British gold had contracted by 1.25, remaining the same as last Saturday. The US dollar also contracted by 0.25, while Hong Kong changed significantly by 0.25. Other currencies also contracted accordingly. Overall, compared to last Saturday, British, American, Indian, and Singapore currencies were even. The French franc increased by one yuan, German and Dutch currencies each increased by 0.25, and Hong Kong increased by 0.125. The domestic market was soft in the morning and firm in the afternoon, especially strong in the afternoon. As a result, British gold contracted by 3.125 and the US dollar only contracted by 0.375. Due to the upward trend in the US-British exchange rate, trading among Chinese gold merchants was very active, with most buying and few selling. Approximately 100,000 pounds of British gold and 780,000 US dollars were traded. However, there were many interbank transactions. Furthermore, Bombay wired to sell several hundred thousand US dollars in the afternoon, and the gold dealers used this to profit by setting the gold price around 40 taels.</p>
<p>British Exchange: The domestic spread was 3.125, with the swap rate even. The selling price in the early market was 1 shilling, 8 pence, 0.125, and the buying price was 1.875. The afternoon closing price was 7 pence, 0.9375 for selling and 8 pence for buying. The closing price in the afternoon was 8.125 for selling and 8.75 for buying.</p>

<p>Compared to last Saturday, it fell by 5/16. The exchange rate between London and New York has been changed to $3.785.</p>
<h3>The Interest Rate Market is Slightly Better</h3>
<p>But Unable to Find a Large Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign interest rate was slightly better than the previous day in terms of supply and demand. However, without significant demand, prices could not increase. The difference between the two markets was only 0.00125. The early market was 7 qian and 0.03 li, and the afternoon market was 7 qian, 0.02 li, 8 hao, and 0.00875 hu. The market situation seemed to be 0.00625 better than the previous day. The silver discount in the two markets remained at 1 qian, the same as the previous day. Bank quotations were also the same, at 4 fen. The premium for "floating head" large amounts was only 5-6 fen. Although it reached 8-9 fen when the market opened, it was fleeting.</p>
<p>The volume of discount bill transactions was over 2.2 million. The volume of remittance and transfer bills was 650,000 in the early market and 520,000 in the afternoon market. The volume of cash demand was 55,000 in the early market and 23,000 in the afternoon market. Interbank transactions were 600,000 in the early market and 500,000 in the afternoon market. Transactions between banks and foreign firms were over 1.2 million. According to clearing information, Chinese merchants cleared over 3.9 million in various payments, over 800,000 in goods payments, over 800,000 in foreign currency payments, over 600,000 in customs duties, and over 700,000 in remittances. Foreign merchants cleared over 4.8 million in various payments, over 900,000 in remittances, over 600,000 in loan payments, and over 1.1 million in goods payments. Money shops cleared over 5.4 million in foreign public bills, over 2.2 million in foreign "floating head" payments, over 3.7 million in silver public bills, and over 2.5 million in silver "floating head" payments. Transactions by small money shops were over 600,000. The early market price for Jiangnan small silver was 6 qian and 0.085 li, slightly higher by 0.0005 li compared to the previous afternoon, with a transaction volume of 2,500 jiao. The afternoon market suddenly increased by 0.045 li to 6 qian, 0.13 li, with a transaction volume of 5,000 jiao. The early market price for Guangdong small silver was 6 qian, 0.12875 li, and the afternoon market price was 6 qian, 0.13 li. The transaction volume was 120,000 jiao in the early market and only 10,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins remained unchanged at 417,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Transactions Are Limited to Old Accounts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, news from financial circles indicated that only old accounts still had large transfers and transactions, and interest rates had to be higher than the previous period. It was said that they had to be at least 10 taels and 0.05 qian, and 11 taels. Various merchant groups did not need much, but except for a few solid businesses on the customer side who were able to continue, even those who had settled their payments from the previous period would probably have difficulty, not to mention ordinary businesses. As for long-term deposits, large amounts of funds coming in and out were still tied to interbank transfers, so they were transferred at similar rates.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Sales Were Quiet</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market remained dull with no improvement. This was because the sales of existing yarn were slow, the situation was uncertain, which dampened sentiment. The foreign interest rate was still difficult to recover. The farmers are busy in the mainland, and there is no hope for yarn sales. The Yangtze River has been suspended for a long time, so the bottom goods have increased. The statistics of each bank's purchases throughout the day were 300 packages, and the market price fell slightly by 0.025 qian. Customer banks in the north purchased 30 packages, 60 packages were purchased in the mainland, 20 packages were purchased in Anqing, 35 packages were purchased in Guangdong, 10 packages were purchased in Changsha, 7 packages were purchased by Hankou banks, and 40 packages were purchased in Shantou, and 60 packages were purchased by other banks.</p>
<h3>Decline in Consumption of Sock Factories, Sharp Decline in Fine Yarn</h3>
<p>The fine yarn market has recently declined sharply, with a significant downward trend. In previous years, there was usually a period of growth during the spring sales season, as white cloth was most popular in the summer. For example, in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, sock factories were numerous and demand was considerable. However, since the Japanese invasion this year, the war has made financial circulation impossible and sales have been severely affected. The price of 42-count "Ren Zhong" yarn in March reached 342 taels, but now it sells for 296 taels, a drop of 46 taels. The price of 32-count "Ren Zhong" yarn was 256 taels, but now it is 232 taels, a drop of 24 taels. This kind of decline is sharp, and the future is not optimistic. After the sudden change in the political situation in the Northeast last year, the supply of the thread was insufficient and sock factories were facing the risk of suspending operations. Later, they used British thread to supplement. The crisis was resolved, but the price was as high as over 400 taels. Recalling the situation of the previous rise and the current fall, one cannot help but feel the difference between then and now.</p>
<h3>Sparse Purchases of Raw Cotton by Factories</h3>
<p>The cotton market is calm, and the foreign cotton situation is showing signs of softening, but the exchange rate is still weak, so sentiment is flat. The factories' attitude is very calm, and they have little intention of purchasing. This is because yarn sales are not smooth. According to some, after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Japanese factories were completely closed. They purchased a lot of American and Indian cotton last year, and now they have a surplus due to lack of demand and want to sell it off. Now, Indian merchants are selling 1,000 bales of Indian cotton to the Shenxin Factory, priced at 30.5 taels, with spot goods delivered to the factory. However, the inventory of domestic cotton is exhausted, and the sources of supply from all regions are depleted. Only Shenxin Factory still has some purchases, with 1,000 bales of Xingheng cotton opened, priced at 30 and a half taels. The spot goods were sent to the factory.</p>
<h3>Indian and English Cotton Industry Weekly Report</h3>
<p>Bombay: The market situation was firm last week. Although Oomra cotton was in short supply, the inventory of various types of cotton was sufficient. According to the current situation, the carryover for this season will increase by 30% compared to last year. The futures market still followed the US cotton market. As a result, there was still hope for an increase. Spot sales were flat, and prices did not fluctuate much. Transactions were speculative in nature. The following is a summary of last week's statistics (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>|                 | 1931   | 1932   |</p>
<p>| --------------- | ------ | ------ |</p>
<p>| Cumulative Receipts Since September 1 | 2,603  | 1,318  |</p>
<p>| Weekend Inventory | 1,012  | 672    |</p>
<p>| Cumulative Exports Since September 1 | 1,722  | 670    |</p>
<p>| To Europe       | 435    | 100    |</p>
<p>| To China        | 237    | 161    |</p>
<p>| To Japan        | 1,034  | 383    |</p>
<p>| Other Regions     | 16     | 26     |</p>
<p>Liverpool: Spot sales fluctuated last week. Futures tended to be bullish due to US bank loans. The political situation was optimistic, the market situation was flat, and transactions were quiet. Egyptian cotton followed the ups and downs of US cotton. Mainland merchants intended to purchase.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Market in Shanghai Stands Firm</h3>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, the sources of supply for each bank were not abundant, and the inventory in Shanghai was limited. Sales in urban and rural stores were slow. The top-quality Northern Japonica rice moved slightly, and the situation was temporarily stable. Although the supply of Bo rice was not abundant, demand was still sluggish. Rural banks also picked up 300 shi of fresh rice, and the market price fell by 0.05 yuan. Early rice arrivals and sales were even, and the market did not fluctuate. Due to the sharp drop in price, foreign low-grade rice felt solid again. "Bian Yin Yuan" rice was rarely sold and the market was flat with neither loss nor profit.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Yesterday, due to windy weather, sources of supply from the West Road around the 30th were declining sharply. The opening price of thick Japonica rice and early and late rice was firm in the beginning, but weak later. Due to the continuous decline in the price of foreign Du tip rice, arrivals were bound to be scarce. The market was stable, and the demand for "Tong Bian Yin Yuan" rice from distilleries was still strong, with the market price rising by about 0.1 yuan. The amount of rice from river factories was less than 3,000 shi.</p>
<h3>Forward Foreign Rice Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Spot Sales Remain Active in This Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the demand for foreign rice was slack, and Hankou banks only sold 300 bags. Sales in this market and the mainland were still good, with 300 bags of current goods of the No. 1 brand and 700 bags of small rice flour. In addition, there were 200 tons of No. 1 Saigon delivery, and the market was similar to the previous market. The situation was slightly weak, but the owners' asking price was still high. The opening price was 11.3 yuan for Saigon and 11 yuan for Saigon delivery. The price for small rice flour was 10.17 yuan to 9.9 yuan. The four-month futures price was temporarily stable, and the May futures price rose because owners were unwilling to sell and foreign firms were not selling due to high production costs. The price of May small rice flour rose from 5.07 taels to 5.1 taels, an increase of 0.05 yuan from last week. The April price was still 4.878 taels. A total of 500 tons were traded. The Min party also sold 200 tons of four-month rice at a price of 4.93 yuan.</p>
<h3>Fewer Buyers, Price of Rice Flour Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for rice flour showed signs of weakness. This was because the period for receiving and paying for these goods was from the 1st to the 20th. Although the purchase and sale before the period was entirely for spot goods, half was also of a futures nature. Even if the goods were not received, it was also possible. Recently, as the 20th approached, those without the strength only gave up. Sales were also sluggish because the market was rising step by step, and customer banks inevitably waited and watched. Therefore, when the opening price was offered, the initial price of the April navy ship was 2.1225 taels, and the May price was 2.1475 taels. However, as buyers were scarce, sales were smooth, so the market weakened. The closing price for April was as low as 2.115 taels, and the price for May was as low as 2.1325 taels, which was 0.0075 taels lower for April and 0.0175 taels lower for May compared to the previous day. However, the subsequent trend was expected to be stable due to the limited number of goods.</p>
<h3>Very Few Silkworms Reared in Lanxi</h3>
<p>Only Two or Three Tenths of Previous Years... The Early Batch Has Just Begun to Collect Ants</p>
<p>The silkworm season in Lanxi, Jinhua, Zhejiang is earlier than in Hangzhou and Shaoxing. This year, farmers have learned from the failure of last year's silkworm rearing, and are also facing economic hardship, with no way to borrow money for silkworm rearing. They are generally hesitant and only families with mulberry trees are breeding improved varieties in reduced quantities. Very few people are rearing silkworms, and the amount is only two or three tenths of previous years. The Grain Rain solar term is approaching, and the early batch of silkworms has just begun to collect ants.</p>
<h3>Foreign Silk Market is Increasingly Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in this port was increasingly sluggish. Foreign firms in Europe and the United States, seeing the sharp decline in overseas silk prices, and Chinese silk merchants, because of the cost of silk, insisted on not selling at a loss, all adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the market atmosphere was calm. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson only imported ten packages of Sichuan yellow filature, and Xiangli imported twelve packages of yellow coarse silk, and the prices remained flat.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Turns from Extremely Quiet to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from sugar production areas. The guild's price assessment and the recent transactions have been quiet, and there is no buying interest. Only sellers are holding tight and unwilling to sell. However, some small retail customers are eager to sell, which has led to a weakening of the market atmosphere. The market price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white has fallen to 12.9 taels, and Hong Kong goods are 12.825 taels. Medium sand white and other types are rarely inquired about. Taikoo Sugar's B mark price is still 16.2 taels, HM mark is 13.7 taels, H mark is 12.2 taels, DY mark is 15.3 taels. Imports and exports are also very scarce, the market is stable, and the quotations are also quiet, with very few transactions. The market situation is gloomy and lacks energy, which is due to the slow sales.</p>
<h3>Limited Actual Transactions of French Wire Nails</h3>
<p>Transactions in French wire nails have been very sluggish recently. The reason is that many export firms have switched to using nails made in local factories. Therefore, except for purchases by retail customers, large transactions are very limited. The market price is gradually easing, and the current market price is 8 taels per barrel, which is 0.025 taels lower than before. It is said that Fujian banks sold 200 barrels yesterday at a price of only 7.9 taels. However, small varieties of wire nails are relatively scarce, so the market is slightly firm. Large varieties, however, are very sluggish due to the abundance of inventory.</p>
<h3>Egg Factories Actively Trade Tinplate</h3>
<p>Egg factories, which have been quiet for a long time, have recently been actively trading tinplate, so the volume of transactions is very large and the market price has been driven up by 0.05 yuan. The current market price of 100 pounds of double-linked American tinplate can reach 31 taels. It is said that over a thousand boxes have been traded.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>250 pieces of tung oil arrived in Shanghai from Hankou.</p>
<p>280 pieces of eggs and over 200 bags of soybeans arrived in Shanghai from the Yangtze River.</p>

<p>Free Discussion</p>
<h3>Record of Platoon Leader Wang, Bao Zheng</h3>
<p>Wang's given name is forgotten. During the Zhili-Fengtian War, he served as a platoon leader. Later, when the troops disintegrated, he resigned and returned home to concentrate on business. He was good at management and had accumulated a lot of wealth. When the Shanghai War broke out, the volunteer army rose up and was at its peak. Ambitious people rushed to join. Wang cried out, "Now is the time to repay the country and avenge our hatred!" He packed his bags and went to see General Cai Tingkai of the 19th Route Army and asked to be enlisted. General Cai saw that he was tall and burly and spoke eloquently, so he questioned him on various key military matters. Wang answered fluently and without any errors. He was assigned to the rear team for reserve duty. Wang insisted on rushing to the front line, even shedding tears. General Cai could not bear to disobey his wishes and agreed. At that time, the two sides were in a truce. Wang quietly lay in the trenches, waiting for the enemy to approach, and then fired his gun. His bullets never missed, and he killed countless enemies. When the authorities heard of this, they promoted him to platoon leader. Not long after, the order to charge was given. Wang raised his knife and pointed at the enemy, bravely leading the charge. Wherever the spear tip reached, the enemy scattered. The prestige of our army was greatly enhanced. General Cai praised his bravery and promoted him to company commander and transferred him to the rear for rest. Wang went forward and said, "The old hatred has been avenged, and my wish has been fulfilled. Why should I be greedy for fame and fortune?" He removed his uniform and weapons and left without looking back. Later, according to his companions, Wang's father was killed by the Japanese in Qingdao, and this trip was purely for revenge.</p>
<h3>Traitor, Gong Yu</h3>
<p>After the Battle of Shanghai, a new term suddenly emerged, namely, the Jiangbei traitor. Newspapers printed daily articles on Jiangbei traitors being hired by the Japanese to throw grenades in various places in the concession. As our army retreated, there were more and more traitors, all referred to as Jiangbei. As a result, people from all walks of life despised those from Jiangbei. In fact, those who willingly acted as traitors were not limited to Jiangbei. Some of the traitors captured in the early stages of the war were not from Jiangbei. Newspaper reports can be cited. For example, in Wusong recently, there is also a puppet organization, and the people in it are not from Jiangbei. However, society did not investigate and mistakenly believed that all traitors were necessarily from Jiangbei. As a result, all Jiangbei people were on the list of those who were despised. Furthermore, from ideological contempt, it progressed to factual exclusion, resulting in Jiangbei people after the war being unable to stand in Shanghai. For example, those who hired servants or rickshaw pullers refused Jiangbei people. Even refugee shelters did not accept Jiangbei refugees. This is truly unjust. Jiangbei is not a place name, but a general term for the area north of the Yangtze River. The people of the counties north of the Yangtze River already have differences in good and bad, civilized and uncivilized. And Jiangbei people living in Shanghai are not entirely unpatriotic. Today, Jiangbei people are refused a foothold in Shanghai, so the laborers who are unwilling to be traitors cannot live and cannot return to their hometowns. They will be forced to go to Zhabei to become traitors. Therefore, in the future, we hope that writers will carefully examine the origin of traitors and not use the term Jiangbei indiscriminately, so that justice can be served.</p>
<h3>World News in Brief</h3>
<p>The World's First Aviator: The aviation industry today can be considered a golden age. However, very few people know who the world's first aviator was. This person was a Brazilian from South America named Bartolomeu De Gusmao. He passed away more than a hundred years ago. For more than a hundred years, almost no one mentioned him. Today, Brazilians remember their origins and the pioneer who started the trend of aviation. They plan to build a monument to him to inspire. According to Brazilian research, he first flew as early as 1705. Whether this is true is still questionable. Brazilians and Portuguese have drawings depicting his strange aircraft that he originally flew. But he did fly once in 1709. There is a letter written by the Queen of Portugal to her mother the day after the flight as proof. She said, "I saw Gusmao's aircraft rise rapidly and happily into the air." He flew twice in total. The first time he flew as high as a three-story building and circled the building before safely landing. The second time, however, he did not fly successfully. He went up and then fell. (Hai Ke)</p>
<p>The Shanghai War and Military Weapons (XIII) - Yi Zang</p>
<p>Gunpowder and Explosives: The origin of gunpowder is very ancient. China already had it during the Han Dynasty. Its use for launching is said to have started with the Arabs and then spread to Europe. But the Arabs' gunpowder was black, a mixture of saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal, which is exactly the same as the composition of pine resin, saltpeter powder, and charcoal used by the Chinese. Japanese gunpowder was transmitted from China. In the mid-seventeenth century, the Germans invented a brown gunpowder. In 1845, they invented a wire gunpowder. European countries used it to equip guns and cannons. In 1884, the French invented smokeless cotton gunpowder. China's major ordnance factories can also manufacture it. As for the highly explosive yellow gunpowder, it was created by the French Di Erban. In recent years, countries have used it to equip field guns or as grenades. In the mid-nineteenth century, a tea-brown gunpowder was invented in Europe. However, the gunpowder used in military affairs today can be divided into three types: launching gunpowder,</p>
<p>destructive gunpowder, and blasting gunpowder. In terms of composition, it can be divided into chemical gunpowder and mixed gunpowder. Smokeless gunpowder is beneficial for launching and is loaded into rifles, machine guns, and small- and medium-caliber cannons. Mixed gunpowder is mostly used in cannons. However, there are many types of smokeless gunpowder. Its use varies depending on the type of gun and cannon and the nature of the gunpowder. In general, the main explosive for shells is yellow medicine, tea-brown medicine, or tea-yellow medicine. The main components of various explosives are mostly nitrates, chlorates, and perchlorates. Recently, due to scientific progress and the development of manufacturing technology, the quality of gunpowder has gradually improved. There are solvent-free gunpowder, flame-extinguishing gunpowder, high-speed gunpowder, and non-hygroscopic gunpowder in launching gunpowder. Therefore, the power of guns and cannons has become more and more fierce.</p>
<p>A Heroic Death (Part 2) - Mo Yi</p>
<p>Half an hour later, the enemy was not as reckless as before, and rushed over, dodged and flashed behind more than thirty tank vehicles. Obviously, after receiving their first lesson, they didn't dare act recklessly anymore, so they used the newest type of war machine – the tank vehicle – as their talisman to charge.</p>
<p>Our brave soldiers proposed to the leader:</p>
<p>"If we want to kill all those short devils, we have to get rid of those bastard vehicles!"</p>
<p>And so, a team of daredevils with the responsibility of destroying the enemy's tank vehicles, immediately formed. There were a total of forty brave warriors. Every one of them was covered in petrol and full of explosives.</p>
<p>As the tank vehicles rushed within very close range of the trenches, the forty warriors who were fighting for the glory of the Chinese people, then rushed out; every tank vehicle was like a venomous dragon, spitting bullets that would kill people. Our brave soldiers threw their grenades up; just as if tossing chicken eggs onto stone, only seeing the grenades exploding, and the tank vehicles still impudently charging over, and as if with a contemptuous smile saying, "No matter how fierce you guys are, this time you probably can't do anything to us!"</p>
<p>The forty warriors, just like forty starving tigers, spreading their arms, their heads lowered, hurried and split up to seize their objective. After they had gotten very close to the tank vehicles, then they all fell to the ground, as if struck by bullets. The enemies driving the tank vehicles, all smiling, showed off how powerful, how sturdy their war machines were, thinking that this time there definitely wouldn't be any obstacles in their advance. They didn't know, when those several tank vehicles climbed over the forty warriors' bodies, that the bulky vehicle bodies, were pressing down on the explosives with natures like wildfire, in an instant causing those newest type of war machines of the twentieth century to lose their power of movement, only hearing the sounds of explosion reverberating underneath the wide vehicle treads; the vehicles were severely shaken, and just like a majestic animal, bearing severe wounds, convulsing; the echoes of the explosion, seemed to be sending out mocking noises of triumph. The executioners on top of the tank vehicles, also dumbstruck and didn't know what to do; at the same time amidst the shouts of triumph from our rushing up warriors, they all became our prisoners and spoils of war.</p>
<p>"Old Zhao, you died so tragically. Alas, even your bones aren't here."</p>
<p>But you died with satisfaction. The enemies on top of the tank vehicles, we will definitely kill every one of them, to avenge you; you can rest easy. … Old Zhao, we'll see you again in twenty years! …</p>
<p>Old Zhang, at the time he and the enemies were fighting in close quarters, while he was killing the enemies, in his mouth, he was comforting the old Zhao who had died underneath the tank vehicles… (End)</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>What is "Normal State"?</h3>
<p>— Jin</p>
<p>According to news from the Kuomin News Agency yesterday, Mr. Hymans, Chairman of the Nineteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations, is currently consulting with both Chinese and Japanese representatives. One of the most important points is the interpretation of the "normal state." Isn't this a ridiculous and pointless matter? If we're talking about reasons why a normal state cannot be restored, I have a few points to make. If the desire is to restore a normal state, this ridiculous and joking question, no matter if we ask Western logicians, legal scholars, or Chinese annotators like Zheng Kangcheng and Yan Shigu to interpret it, no one will have the ability to explain this ridiculous term properly.</p>
<p>First, how can a normal state be restored under the pressure of the Japanese army's heavy forces? The reason why a normal state cannot be restored is entirely due to the Japanese forces stationed in large numbers. Therefore, to restore a normal state, the Japanese army must first completely withdraw.</p>
<p>Second, who should be the subject for determining whether a normal state has been restored? Should we use our country's observation as the standard? Should we use the Japanese observation as the standard? Or should we use a third party's observation as the standard? Suppose other countries believe that a normal state has been restored, but the Japanese say no and do not believe that a normal state has been restored, then what will happen?</p>
<p>Third, even if China and Japan largely agree that a normal state has been restored, but the Japanese have many tricks, either using plainclothes teams or taking advantage of Chinese traitors to stir up trouble from within, then how can a normal state be restored?</p>
<p>Fourth, since our country experienced this war, the losses to commerce and the people cannot be counted with numbers. Even if the war ends here, the purchasing power of the people has already decreased significantly. Not only is there no ability to buy Japanese goods, but there is also no ability to buy goods from other countries. How can a normal state be restored? Moreover, where the army arrives, houses become ruins, spring planting is missed, and how can there be a harvest in autumn? Soldiers and bandits are everywhere, and the people have nowhere to die. How can a normal state be restored?</p>
<p>Therefore, for the League of Nations committee to consider the four characters "normal state" as important and to want to interpret them is truly the biggest joke in the world. Now, the members of the League of Nations only need to recognize the two points resolved by the League of Nations General Assembly:</p>
<p>One, the League of Nations does not recognize or tolerate the destruction of China's territorial integrity and political sovereignty.</p>
<p>Two, resolving the current dispute under the force of arms and other coercion is illegal. If the League of Nations members can recognize these two points, then this pointless and ridiculous question need not be considered any further.</p>

<h3>Spring Rain</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zun</p>
<p>Spring sorrow resembles spring bamboo shoots, sprouting in clusters with rain,</p>
<p>Spring rain is like spring tears, dripping all night until dawn.</p>
<p>Spring rain will sometimes end, but my tears never stop,</p>
<p>Dropping onto the grass below the steps, the grass doesn't turn green.</p>
<p>Sprinkling on the fish in the pond, the fish in the pond suddenly don't live.</p>
<p>I ask you, why are you alone? Is there some great injustice?</p>
<p>Why not ride a tall steed, alongside those heading to important posts,</p>
<p>While beauties with faces like flowers, leisurely stroll in Luoyang City.</p>
<p>What are the spring clouds saying? They say they are the souls of war ghosts,</p>
<p>Ascending to heaven and descending to earth, turning into rain pouring down.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the pouring rain? To wash your brain clean,</p>
<p>Wash your brain clean, do not be blinded by fame and fortune.</p>
<p>Ghosts have no day to return to being human, a lost nation is hard to recover.</p>
<h3>Retreating Soldiers</h3>

<p>Dilapidated walls and broken wells see a temporary renewal.</p>

<h3>Semi-Automatic Rifle</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yi (Translation)</p>
<p>Recently, someone in the United States invented a new type of rifle called the semi-automatic rifle (Scmiautomatic Rfile). The American military authorities are currently testing it. Once the test is passed, all previously used rifles will be discarded and replaced with this new type of rifle.</p>
<p>For decades, many people have been engaged in designing semi-automatic rifles, but the results have not been satisfactory. Recently, more than a dozen types have been submitted to the US government for testing. Currently, only two types are being tested, one made by J. D. Pedersen and the other made by J. C. Garand.</p>
<p>Regarding the advantages of semi-automatic rifles, U.S. Army officer Hatcber reported to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, mainly as follows:</p>
<p>"The current army rifle in use is the so-called repeating rifle. The repeating rifle has a magazine containing five cartridges. After one cartridge is fired, the mechanism is manually operated to eject the empty cartridge and load a new cartridge for continuous firing. However, operating the mechanism is complicated and requires great force, which often delays the opportunity or causes the aim to be lost. The semi-automatic rifle is different. All cartridge replacement actions are mostly handled by the cartridge itself, and the user only needs to press a button, which is extremely effortless. Therefore, once aimed, continuous firing is possible without missing the target due to cartridge replacement. In future wars, aircraft will be very active, and troops are at risk of being attacked at any time. If a repeating rifle is used, the mechanism must be manually operated each time a shot is fired. For rapidly moving objects such as aircraft, it is difficult to aim and shoot continuously. Therefore, the semi-automatic rifle is preferred."</p>
<p>The application of automatic ammunition firing to machine guns has been around for many years, but the bulkiness of machine guns is not a problem, while rifles must be as light as possible. It is not easy to install an automatic mechanism on a rifle without increasing its weight. The difficulty of success of the semi-automatic rifle lies in this. There are already several types of semi-automatic hunting rifles, but their firepower is very different from that of military rifles. In the future, the US military will inevitably switch to this type of semi-automatic rifle, which is beyond doubt. The great powers' attention to armaments is evident. What are the thoughts of the Chinese people on this?</p>

<h3>The Feelings of a Newspaper Vendor</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Ah Bao, a fourteen-year-old newspaper vendor, started calling out on the streets when the sounds of cannons shook the tiles and the fire lit up the sky. At that time, his business was very good, so that scene was particularly deeply etched in his memory. For example, at that time, as long as he shouted loudly, "Want to see the Eastern □□ suffer defeat?" someone would smile lightly at him and scold him softly, "Little rascal," and then happily buy a copy… He thought his business skills were indeed not bad, even much better than those opium smokers. But once, on a very bustling street, he saw a female newspaper vendor, who looked like a female student of eighteen or nineteen years old, whose sales skills were excellent. She didn't even need to shout; as long as she walked along, many people would naturally rush to her with smiles, even making her so busy that her hands and feet were in a fluster. However, he himself couldn't get any business at the same time and in the same place, so he had to run away dejectedly. He thought:</p>
<p>"Damn it, I just don't believe that newspapers sold by women smell better?"</p>
<p>However, now it's even more different. Business is simply non-existent. Even if he runs to the entrance of the big mansions that he rarely goes to and shouts until his throat is sore, no one is seen to generously buy a copy. What is the reason for this? He thought it was because he wasn't shouting "Eastern □□ are suffering defeat", right? But his father had already told him that he couldn't shout that anymore and could only simply call out "Want the newly published…" What can be done about this?</p>
<p>But now the market is indeed very different: for example, the signs posted on the store doors used to say "…boycott to resist humiliation," but now it says "endure the pain and open the market"; before, there was crying and weeping everywhere from people moving, but now there are rickshaws carrying beautiful girls wearing brand new spring clothes; before, there was the rumbling of cannons, but now there is the "Western laugh" of the phonograph. Everything is "the earth returning to spring," everything is the peaceful scene of "Greater Shanghai," a "free city." So, the movie theaters are filled with light-hearted laughter, so this little newspaper vendor is no longer noticed, and even that eighteen- or nineteen-year-old female newspaper vendor is no longer in fashion, right?</p>
<p>In short, now the Easterners have won, and everyone doesn't need to read the newspaper anymore, so why don't they just stop fighting? This is a big loss for the little newspaper vendor's family!</p>

<h3>Also a Jiangbei Person</h3>
<p>— Zhisheng</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, I was chatting with some friends about current affairs, talking eloquently and with great interest. Just as we were about to drink tea to quench our thirst, we suddenly heard a water chestnut seller singing in front of the door. So we called him in, chose the fruit, and discussed the price. The price was not right, and one of my classmates jokingly said to him, "Your heart is too black. Why don't you serve the Japanese? Then your income would be much more than from this peddling."</p>
<p>This person glared and scolded, "You gentlemen are all knowledgeable and polite, so why would you utter such evil words to slander me? Those who are traitors are not all my fellow Jiangbei people. People from other places also sometimes do it, but Jiangbei people account for the majority. However, the name of disloyalty has been entirely placed on Jiangbei people. Although I am foolish and lowly, I have known since I was young that loving the country is important. Therefore, during this incident, some people may have invited me to join the traitors, but I always refused. I sincerely know that being a traitor must be profitable, but when the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked. What benefit is there in profit? Therefore, I am willing to engage in this lowly occupation, enduring hardship and living in peace."</p>
<p>When I heard this, I stood up in awe and concluded the deal regardless of the price. Afterwards, I thought, a Jiangbei person like this truly does not lose his integrity as a Jiangbei person. The good and bad among people are inherently uneven. We cannot condemn everyone because of the bad behavior of one person. Therefore, Confucius said, "In a village of ten households, there must be someone of loyalty and integrity," which is exactly what he meant. For example, even between the brothers of Liu Xiahui and Zhi (Dao Zhi), there are differences between the good and the bad. Although some Jiangbei people are willing to be traitors, there may also be some who devote themselves to serving the country. Therefore, I quickly recount this to show that not all Jiangbei people are traitorous.</p>
<p>There are indeed many Jiangbei people who are traitors. Therefore, in the local news or in the articles submitted by gentlemen, they often scold Jiangbei people. I also deeply hate Jiangbei people and deeply feel sorry for them, because I clearly know that Jiangbei people are not completely traitors. Now, I have received an article submitted by Mr. Zhisheng, titled "Also a Jiangbei Person," which I am specially publishing to express the breath of Jiangbei people. - Editor's Note.</p>

After that, Zhang went to various European countries, such as Germany, Austria, Italy, France, and the Low Countries. Zhang himself said that he went to Russia to study at the age of eight. In his spare time, he liked to practice martial arts. When he grew up, his skills became more refined. After returning to China, he received guidance from famous teachers, and his attainments became even deeper. The most impressive of his skills are the toad dance and the high platform dive. In addition, there are many other amazing skills. His wife, Zhang Cuiying, and more than 20 male and female troupe members all have profound martial arts skills. It is said that Zhang plans to perform in Shanghai in the near future.</p>
