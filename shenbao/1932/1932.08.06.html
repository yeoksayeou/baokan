<h3 id="c1">義勇軍與日本移民　仁 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近數日來。義軍捷報頻傳。攻營口。佔通遼。克連山。並限令日方。還我錦州。聲勢所被。萬姓欣慰。倘果再踴躍猛進。則義軍此舉。不僅可以振我民族精神。且將予日本移民以重大之打擊。請申其說。</p>
<p>據旬前東京朝日新聞所載。謂［軍部方面。將與满洲僞政府交涉。選定满鐡吉敦兩鐡路沿線之土地。恊定其價格。而公平分配之。以確立日本移民满洲之根本方針。同時日本之移民。擬採用屯田兵式。而以明春訓練所卒業生爲其集團之指導者。目下關東軍已調查完竣。而認爲適當之移民地者。有大孤山遼陽鐡嶺附近满鐡沿線吉敦及三姓方面數處云］</p>
<p>再據四日東京聯合電。謂［日陸軍省方面。將以千五百萬圓之經費。移民北满一萬人。其移民資格。則限於在鄉軍人中之有志願者云。］</p>
<p>夫日本之移民東北。本爲其數十年來之傳統政策。第以氣候懸殊。成效極鮮。故近十年來。已　改其從來之計劃。而易以［以日移鮮以鮮移满］之方針矣。唯此次日本軍部之武裝移民政策。其宗旨似不僅爲單純之移民。而實具有也種之政治的意義。</p>
<p>今日東三省各地。義勇軍蠭起雲湧。日本雖械精器銳。然仍不能稍挫其氣。蓋我義軍之興。乃激於民族之意識。故數閱月來。此仆被繼。日方已覺疲於奔命。是以不能不急急於武裝之移民。以補日軍之所未及。此最近日本軍部移民意義之一也。</p>
<p>次之。日本慫恿叛逆建立僞國後。接收海關。攫奪郵權。爲所欲爲。毫無顧忌。雖一方面皆諉責於满洲僞國。以敷衍國際間之與論然在另一方面。日本固仍顧慮及於未來國際態度之轉變。最近調查團報告書。已着手編製。結論如何。尙難預斷。故日本爲未雨綢繆計。自不能不事先鞏固其在满勢力。庶使一旦調查團或國際間不與满洲僞國以承認。而仍認東北爲我國領土時。則日本仍可藉其在满移民勢力以爲敵對。此最近日本軍部移民之又一意義也。　　今義軍猛攻南满沿線。事實上已予日本移民政策以極大之威脅。而日本亦必竭全力以壓迫之。若義勇今後。竟以無後援而失敗。則不特日本之移</p>
<p>民政策可以奏功。而東北亦將永無收復之望矣。</p>

<p>▲满洲國之參加世界運動會全屬謠傳</p>
<p>▲大會委員會曾向黄總領事切實保證</p>
<p>▲我國派選手參加極爲美國人士注意</p>
<p>萬國體育會委員王儒堂傅士之代表沈嗣良氏、七月十四日自美國加州勃克萊地方來函云、余所搭乘之輪船、每抵一埠、常有新聞記者特備小輪來迓而於日本及舊金山兩地爲　多、足見中國此番初次參加界運動會、大爲人所着目也、所聞於吾國遣派運動員兩名之事尤衆日本報紙對此頗爲關心、但其評論則應少余在舊金山時、曾遇美國及中華新聞記者、輪船抵埠之時或翌日各報均載中國參與此次世界運動大會之消息、華僑對於各項消息及劉長春之確實參予、尤顯關心之切、劉之出席參加、將令中國許多喁望之人、褒美尊重、余敢斷言也、</p>
<p>余抵此間後卽往訪中華總領事黄芸蘇博士、在其辦事室中獲覩關於謠傳組織委員會承認满洲國參加運動會事渠致委員會之函　及覆信、據來往函件觀察之、委員會並無此舉亦從未正准許其參加夏令配亞委員會　切實向黄總領事保證所有謠傳乃歸鳥有、上海西文報紙、雖有中國政府命令黄總領事於運動會正式開幕時、代表中國參加之消息但直至今日黄芝蘇博士語余、並未接到此　任命、余固希望渠終能接得中央之訓令蓋余極希望渠能偕余同往洛杉磯也、</p>
<p>月終舉行之盛典、種種籌備咸已就緒、胡佛　統當能執正式開幕之禮、紐約州長羅司福氏料亦能來、外國運動員業已有數百人抵洛杉磯、作最後之一　訓練、各地報紙咸有夏令匹亞之特載新聞、各項運動之入場券均能在美國各城市購得之、出售票之招牌、街頭巷尾、獨目皆是、舉國上下咸知有此盛舉也、</p>
<p>美國於田徑錦標有把握、本星期六日、美國選手在加利福尼亞作全國之總預選、許多世界紀錄咸爲减色、美國賽跑能手大有人在也、</p>
<p>美國又望游泳得勝、日本競爭甚力、或居亞軍、日本游泳　具有極大希望、以爲游泳錦標之得獲、可操左券、關於他項運動之預測、現在爲時尙覺過早、各項運動報名以七月十六日爲截止期、十二日余以劉長春百米·二百米·四百米賽跑向會豋記、余等雖不多所希望、但斯係開端、希望此乃一良佳之開場耳、</p>

<p>— 翰記</p>
<p>海參威被俄人拿去的時候，大家都不知道海參威在那裏，連地圖都不容易找到。講起地圖，就要想到淸康熙繪圖的一段史料，亦見天主敎傳流中國考。　　（康熙四十七年，命神父分赴蒙古各部及中國各省，遍覽山水城郭，用西洋三角量法，繪畫輿圖，並諭部臣選派幹員，隨往照料；又行文於各督撫，轉飭所屬地方官，供應一切需要）。········</p>
<p>［自康熙四十七·白進，雷孝思，杜德美，潘如，德瑪諾等十餘位神父分赴各省繪圖，先由關外辦起，次及内地各省，歷九年之久，圖始告成，名曰皇輿全覽圖，總圖之外，又有各省分圖，白進等以之進呈御覽，大蒙皇上褒嘉。］········［康熙五十八年，皇上持輿圖諭内閣學士蔣廷錫曰］··　　［此圖朕費三十餘年心力，始得告成，山脈水道，俱與禹貢相合，爾可將此圖與九卿看尋。］</p>
<p>九鄕求頒賜，皇上允之，於是神父所繪之輿圖，流傳廣遠，偏於全國矣。中國之有輿圖實自此始。從前利瑪竇所繪之輿圖，缺略尙多，若中國人所繪之輿圖，拉雜錯誤，不値識者一笑。至今中外人士，凡繪中國輿圖者，槪以康熙輿圖爲藍本。］</p>
<p>這中國第一張輿圖，康熙看得很鄭重，好比拿破侖看民法典樣。原來拿破侖流亡在聖愛倫島上，在臨末之夜，對他的忠將蒙都隆說··［吾生平百戰百勝，滑鐡盧之役，就全功盡棄，付諸流水，惟有這部民法典才是吾唯一的成功。］</p>
<p>康熙深愛那地圖，所以特地命人造了一張白玉的八仙桌，在白玉的桌面上用極精細的刻工，刻成了一幅金鑲白玉的地圖，這是非史册所載的一件故事。英法聯軍之役，英人拿這白玉的八仙桌運到上海，吾親眼看見這幅金鑲白玉的地圖。後來聽說那張白玉的八仙桌，不知怎樣，竟沉在地中海裏，終於没有運到英國。</p>

<p>— 綿憾</p>
<p>檳榔嶼之蛇廟　檳榔嶼Penang一名庇能。爲英屬海峽殖民地三州府之一。南洋羣島之花園也。嶼上有　區名深奇刻壟。著名之蛇廟在焉。廟中長蛇三五成羣。盤繞於灌木或蜿蜒於階石上。見人不噬亦不走避。昻首吐舌。怡然有自得之態。蛇多黄色。共計約數百條。實數無人知之。蛇性極馴。向不傷人。即有人觸之撫之。亦絶無異動。蛇有食鷄蛋癖。客有購蛋食之者。則頷首對客表示謝意。蛇利用其銳齒。在蛋端破一孔。將蛋之黄白盡行吸去。食時動作迅速。而蛋不碎。土人以廟多蛇而蛇於人無害。信爲有神。故此廟香火其盛。每年廢歷正月初六爲當地土人祭廟之大日子。（意即謂節期也）祭者出入蛇廟。絡繹不絶。竭盡迷信之表示。而新客甫至南洋。聞廟蛇雖爲蛇蝎。其性不毒。亦多赴廟參者。故守廟之人。乘機販賣香燭紙錠及鷄蛋。其收入頗不惡云。</p>
<p>▲新加坡植物園新加坡Singapore之植物園。居於武吉池馬區之荷蘭路。面積約三百五十英畝。園内樹草密佈。並有池塘。事務所·圖書室·及試騐房等。建築精雅。設備完全。該園創於一八七四年。南洋之樹膠。即爲上述試騐房中實騐之結晶。園亦以此著名。入園門後。循柏油路前進。左側可見寳冠樹。碩莪椰了等熱帶植物。右側地勢起伏。綠茵满目。邱之高處。宛如一臺。周圍植有高可參天之喬木。月夜遊此。恍若别有天地。非復人間矣。由邱麓轉向。始遇池塘。池中有丈餘見方之草地。上植檬果樹。相傳唐僧三藏爲介紹檬果入中國之第一人。是否由此携歸中國。無可考。池畔有留連果樹。狀甚奇異。由池塘前進。則爲坂路。路側有菩提樹。葉形似囊。並有檳榔樹及無憂樹。梵文稱無憂樹爲阿輸迦。印人敬之如神。更右行可入事務所。左轉仍至柏油路。復進於十字路口之右側則有日蔭室。由此西行。可達椰子谷。此中椰子種類繁多。眩人心目。有所謂象牙椰子·砂糖椰子·大葉椰子·蠟飛椰子·扇葉椰子·大王椰子·貝葉椰子等。過椰子谷。即可出園。此園富於熱帶植物。凡研究植物者。無不以一睹爲快。園之後門。樹林中多猴。蹲躅道上。見人不懼。反叩首索物。捕之則走避。其行如飛。頃刻即杳。</p>

<p>— 勞人</p>
<p>羅克誰知道他是霍萊塢的笑匠。大凡影戲迷腦海裏都有這位先生的種種滑稽舉動。最近綠杉磯忽發生眞假羅克訴訟。究竟葫蘆中眞相如何。這個啞謎。至今還未能打破。至於黄阿媚呢。認識伊的恐怕更多了。因爲伊是中國在海外唯一的顆星。上月被一個驀生的老太太。糾纏不淸。硬說是伊的母親。眞是滑稽極了。</p>
<p>▲眞假羅克訴訟眞假羅克訴訟。發生了好幾年。紐約法庭。關於這個案件。審判了許久。總未能决。雙方各執一詞。愈爭愈烈。原告堅持現在拍影戲的羅克是假的。應治以冒充之罪。他向官廳請求說。［本人是蒲卡特Ｂurcbard　Nebraska生長哈洛勞特。冒充的電影明星。須禁止其再用哈洛勞之名。當時官廳以原告無充分證據。遂判决了被告勝訴。不料在上月。原告復死灰復燃。向法院作第二次的探訴。羅克已經用去千金。和他周旋。目下尙無結果。不過羅克製片公司。每天答覆各界重問訴訟事件的信札。異常忙碌。最奇怪的就是羅克接到一封揑名信說。［足下値價一千二百萬元。希速送下若干］。由此推測。這冒充訴訟的關鍵。可見一斑了。</p>
<p>▲黄阿媚的母親中國女明星黄阿媚。在霍萊塢已有相當歷史。伊居住的地方。名斐格羅也街。Figueroa　Street家庭裏除了雙親外。還有一個小妹妹名呌瑪麗。有一天阿媚接到一封信。裏面内容是［阿媚鑒。速來北國街九○八號。母字］。阿媚驚奇達了極點。立刻走商於伊的律師。爲避免綁票危險起見。向警廳報告。派偵探三人隨往。到了信面指定的地點。看見一個老年婦人。握住阿媚的手。滔滔不絶地說道。［十年前。我有一愛女。忽從中國失踪。訪尋無着。偶在銀幕上看見女士芳容。和我愛女模樣相髣髴。所以才不遠萬里。來和女士相見］。阿媚雖聽完了伊的話。加以安慰而别。第三天中國老婦萬里尋女的美譚。又遍傳霍萊塢了。</p>

<p>（二九）料器工廠</p>
<p>上海製造料器者有十餘家。大者如中華鳳記浦東第一廠公益仁和謙益炳泰上海恊昌三益降記等。而新亞化工製藥廠。亦兼製玻璃瓶類。及錶面玻璃。此項裝置藥液之瓶類。須用硬質玻璃製之。否則藥起化學作用。瓶將破裂。我國製造硬質玻璃瓶類。及錶面玻璃者。只此新亞一家耳。其餘則大都以製造燈罩爲主。</p>
<p>製告造罩原料爲玻璃砂。産自江蘇宿遷。廣東海陸豐等處。分析之。其成分大約爲錳英石石粉硫化石炭硫酸鈉砂炭酸鉀炭酸鈣氣化鉛碱等物。然在上海製造者。大都收買碎玻璃片。重化以</p>
<p>製之。取其便利而價廉。惟欲製硬質玻璃者。則非加用原料不可矣。</p>
<p>燒料須用爐。爐以鍋灰木製成。燃料爲木炭或煙煤。經四五小時之燃燒力。鍋内質料溶爲液體。工人齊集爐旁。用玻璃管之一端。探入鍋内。稍粘藥液。卽行取出。見管之一端。有溶液成球狀。卽以口吹之成長泡形。然後放入模型中。再吹之。燈罩遂成。上項模型皆鐡製。一型成燈罩二枚或三枚。傾出後用車床車開。磨床磨光。再入烘灶内。經一度蒸烘。於是此罩經久耐用。可以出售矣。價目至不一律。而内地銷場較佳。惟製造燈罩時。雖有模型。仍須口吹手轉時之手段得法蓋非十分熟手工人不可也。工資有和每人每月五六十元者。</p>
<p>日人在上海開設者。有寳成。在顧家灣。三公。在梧州路。而横浜路之寳山玻璃廠。係中日合資開設者。資三五十萬元。係上海玻璃廠中之最大者。</p>

<p>六十三</p>
<p>我說：［個人態度的改變固屬可能；但是專靠個人的努力來推動工學團是靠不住的並且是緩不濟急。現在中國已經到了生死關頭，時勢决不許我們個人從從容容的去脫這傳統的蛇殼。我不耐等候這工學團的自然的傳佈；我急願聽你說一說那强制的傳佈。］</p>
<p>朱先生說：［强制的傳佈便是必然的傳佈。工學團的必然的傳佈是從兩條路來。（一）現在全國一般的現象是要進小學而不得進的學齡兒童超過小學新生容納量數倍：要進中學而不得進的小學畢業生超過中學新生容納量數倍；要進大學而不得進的中學畢業生超過大學新生容納量數倍。新的大學，新的中學，新的小學是無力加開，那末，不能考進大學，中學小學的大多數的學生往那裏去？他們的求知慾已被啓發，事實决不許他們進純粹求知的學校，這工學團是恰合他們的需要。（二）傳統的大學，小學，中學是會消費而不會生産。他們所造就出來的人也自然是會消費而不會生産。會消費而不會生産的人是没有人要的。從前南開大學曾有［輪　敎育］之討論。所謂［輪　敎育］即是先生敎學生，學生變先生輪　不已都在學校的圍牆裏兜圏子。現在連這輪　的圏子也靠不住了。大學畢業生要想做小學先生已是難事，那中學畢業生是更不必說了。一個小學敎師出缺，候補的有時是多至數十人。這明明指示我們說，傳統學校是到了山窮水盡。有用之物如果生産過剩，尙且賣不出去，何况廢物！傳統學校造出來的原是廢人，不易出賣，幸有低級學校敎師的位置，讓他傾銷，現在連這傾銷之路已塞，還能再造廢人嗎？這些事實是必然的來到，必然的逼迫全民族覺悟，必然的强制全民族另我生路而不許他再在這三叉路口有片刻的徘徊。在這個生死關頭上全民族也許下個總動員的命令要大家一齊過些工學團的生活，那末，轉危爲安便易如反掌了。］</p>

<p>▲新閘昨市來船不多、本街去化極淡、各貨跌勢較南市爲銳、常錫北粳各低二角、石浦松江薄稻亦跟小近角、蘆洋尖受白破價廉、消化異常滯細、形呈疲跌、新粳與南市同跌、</p>

<p>昨糖市公會市場劃交易零落、出户均屬缺乏、荷糖二十四號粗矽白價升十四兩七錢、成交數百袋、比之前日步漲五分、而市形且甚挺、十八號中砂白十四兩、十四號生砂赤十二兩七錢、碗靑劃價逐升一錢、計爲九兩一錢、趨勢均稳、太古糖進出不多、Ｂ嘜十六兩四錢出户殊乏、ＨＸ嘜十五兩三錢、ＨＭ嘜十四兩八錢、Ｈ嘜十二兩五錢半、市氣平定、號盤有華新號售開生砂赤五六百袋、價元十二兩七錢、市頗俏俐云、</p>

<p>▲行盤隨之而低</p>
<p>白蓮現値初次豋新、首批僅到十餘袋、地價爲六十六元、此批粒子較小、至旺出時當可長足貨品自必見佳、聞今庚收成尙豐、後市勢必步鬆　此間行盤少數曾售五十二兩、現爲五十一兩、仍看續降、</p>

<p>海口枝出新以來、因貨價相宜　走場甚爲活潑、前批所到、已將銷罄、茲聞昨日太古公司之瓊州輪入口、又到三千餘箱、數額比前較多、大約今日可以見樣、此次開價當有微鬆希望、但不致過於離譜云、</p>

<p>浙屬杭·紹·湖·嘉·今歳春夏兩蠶、均受天時之損害、蠶産奇歉、各屬繭行開秤者寥若晨星、蠶户有繭難售、繭價奇小、莫不大受虧折、浙省政府現正普勸農民、補育秋蠶、藉收桑榆之利、而補不足、各製種塲均派員分赴各市鄉、推銷改良秋蠶種、稍數頗暢、惟農村經濟恐慌、大半記帪、須俟收繭售欵淸償云、</p>

<p>洪江桐油、本在夏令旺銷之貨、但今春江浙兩省受滬戰影響、人民驚魂甫定、商業雖已恢復而暗中不免减色、所幸各牌産額大减、較往年祇有五六成、所以客家售貨不若從前之遷就、端節天、熱度特高、鄉民正値髹漆器具之時、銷塲隨之活動、市情亦轉俏勢、副洪如慶元豐須售十七兩八錢、劉同慶十七兩二錢、集豐盈祥泰豐均十七兩、正牌如濟昌和因産數不及往年半數、故已售罄聞矣、吉盈豐向不多産、存數亦微、聞本埠各號共存正别各牌已不及三千矣、較之往年、實半數尙弱也、</p>

<p>昨日五金交易、依然平淡、客路及廠家仍覺滯呆、而建築帮生意亦平淡無奇、故全市趨况、依然無特殊進展、茲將昨市情形錄左、</p>
<p>▲英鋼板昨日微有開出　昨日靑島·天津·諸帮、略有活動、故開出四五百担、價半分五兩七錢、七厘半五兩六錢、二厘半及一分均無開出、而市亦無甚升降、調查後批到貨不多、是以人心甚佳、</p>
<p>▲英白鐡薄貨有人收羅薄貨英白鐡近日有人收羅、市象比前略挺、價躉數成交六尺七錢九分、七尺九錢、若紅鳥等鐡行市尙須增加一二分、據調查現貨已屬不多、人心甚挺、市亦看好、</p>
<p>▲馬口鐡同業預備囤積馬口鐡有漲價之訊、已數聞而不鮮矣、惟最近金融富裕之號家、紛紛在市收囤、致流通貨大感歉缺、標準扶搖直上、刻市九十磅售十兩零五錢、一百磅十二兩二錢半、美貨九十磅十四兩、一百磅十五兩、二百磅美貨售二十三兩五錢、</p>
<p>▲白鐡瓦銷路時過景遷　白鐡瓦最近銷路十分冷淡、蓋　汛已過、各帮採辦不旺、市象頗有停頓之勢、惟底存枯薄、人心向强、所以行情尙能不跌計二十二號每担售七兩七錢半、二十四號九兩、二十六號十兩零五錢、二十八號十一兩</p>

<p>▲長江日艦調滬　　日本海軍第二十四隊驅逐艦柳·桃·樫·檜、係一二八戰時增調至上海者、停戰後加入第一外遣隊、派駐南京大冶等處、上海自血魂團事發生、日海軍省已先派十五隊四艦全駐上海、茲又電令駐寗之輕巡洋艦天龍號、與該二十四隊之四驅逐艦開滬、昨日上午十時十分、天龍進口、至十二時三十五分、四驅逐艦抵吳淞、午後開進浦江、各艦在楊樹浦江面抛錨、</p>

<p>新聲社記者昨訪研究委員會主任諸文綺、請其發表對於廢兩改元之意見、據談、本人以超然地位、就經濟理論觀念、主張（一）新銀幣之重量及成色、應以現在市面上通行含銀成色最低之銀幣　　爲標準、蓋惡貨幣驅逐良貨幣、爲理論上及事實上不可避免之現象、惡貨幣如能流通市面、則良銀幣自被銷鎔、故袁世凱銀幣出現後、江南銀幣卽减少、孫中山銀幣出現後、袁世凱銀幣亦漸消滅、故如果新銀幣成色、在流行市面之惡幣之上、則將來必發現一方面製造一方面銷鎔之弊病、反之、則狄愛德所主張實行新幣後各種雜色銀幣、一律收回、自然不生問題矣、（二）在有效期間之銀兩契約、與銀幣折合比率、如何規定、本人主張有以下數種辦法、（甲）由政府頒布命令、如假定二十二年元旦廢兩、則以前銀兩契約、統照二十一年十二月末日之市價折合、（乙）由政府命令規定、假定明年九月一日實行廢兩、則在此一年期内銀兩契約、仍可照市折算、至長期契約、或由雙方議定折中價格、或由當地商會議定折中價格、請由政府核定辦理、（三）應採取何種方法、可使社會一般人對於此次變更、瞭解而信任、則本人以爲可採取錢業及耿愛德之意見、如（甲）紙幣發行、至少應有六成準備現金、不得以他種欵項抵移、（乙）由各公團隨時公開檢查、（丙）運輸自由、（丁）中央造幣廠作爲中國全部之造幣廠、其餘各廠、應卽拆除、（四）新銀幣鑄費、本人主張應由人民擔任、卽民三條例、亦如此規定、德法及日本、均照此辦理、蓋如果由政府擔負、則人民可隨時鎔化新幣、以代銀貨之用、舉例明之、卽銀樓不必購買銀條、多費手續、只須鎔化銀幣應用、而國家乃必加工鼓鑄、其損失豈非甚鉅、以上種種、爲本人個人之意見、當貢獻研究委員會參考、</p>

<h3 id="c234">王賡判處徒刑 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>當滬戰時，前八十八師獨立旅長王賡，擅離職守，走入敵軍重地，被日軍拘押，經交涉釋放，當經軍部軍法司組織高等軍法會審，及嚴密偵查，確無通敵嫌疑與證據，僅判處有期徒刑二年六個月。</p>
<p>現在的新刑法，模仿歐美，注重證據，亦是不差，但中國情形，在一切偵查機關與偵探術未曾設備以前，若專重證據，是否適用，并且王賡之案，正在軍事時期，是否適用於尋常刑事手續，亦爲疑問，茲姑不論，此事旣經當局組織高等軍法會審，先後會審數次，及嚴密偵查，認爲無通敵嫌疑與證據，但我謂證據容或無之，若曰無嫌疑，則我未敢信。</p>
<p>十九路與敵抗戰一月有餘，其戰事重心，均在江灣，八字橋，薀藻浜等處，自王賡被敵軍拘獲後，日軍突然變更作戰計劃，全力趨重瀏河方面，以致我軍形勢陡變，此可疑者一，</p>
<p>王賡身爲軍事長官，而在兩軍戰事形勢，正在嚴重之時，而王忽無故跑入敵軍重地，以致被拘，旣失我軍體面，又喪個人人格，王君此行，究屬何意，此可疑者二。</p>
<p>王賡旣被敵軍拘留，敵軍一定視爲奇貨，决不放鬆，試閱敵方戰事畫報，王賡在敵司令部嚴訊時，王埀頭喪氣之情形，見者莫不認爲奇恥大辱，何以一經交涉，立即釋放，在王之供詞，敵方嚴守秘密，並不宣布，在我方將有何法偵查，則我國軍情，是否未被洩露，此又可疑者三。</p>

<h3 id="c237">琺瑯製品淺說 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 沈敏</p>
<p>琺瑯製品很多。如面盆，琺瑯招牌，食鍋等等。都由琺瑯製成。琺瑯的發明人。大槪是一千七百九十九年的英國赫克林(Hiokling)。不過我國北平所出的景泰藍發明遠在明代。實在有同項意思。但是從前没有人去研究和改良。以致只用在美術品上去。不過琺瑯的底坯是鐡做的。景泰藍的底坯是銅的。或是銀的。這一點是有不同的性質在裏面。　　琺瑯製造的方法。是先做成鐡坯。或是鋅與合金製成的坯子。不過不能　入鉛質。因鉛是有毒的。假使製爲食用器具。就糟了。坯子做成之後。然後塗上琺瑯熔液。這種琺瑯熔液。普通分爲兩層。塗附第一層塗附的熔液。熔點要很高。而且附着的一層並不均匀緻密。成爲多孔性的物質。因爲底坯的金屬物是有遇熱而漲。遇冷而縮的物理性質。所以要牠留一漲縮的地步。必須有孔點纔好。第二層可以用比較容易熔的配合物。他的性質與瓷器上面的釉藥相仿。現在我將兩層所用的原料和配合方法。略舉一例如后。</p>
<p>（一）第一層琺瑯鎔液這層關係琺瑯與底坯的固着力。所以很爲重要。所用原料必須與底坯的金屬相合。孔點的大小也要與所用金屬的漲縮度相配。普通是用矽石（Powder　Silica）十二分。硼砂(Borak)半分。螢石(Fluorite)。六分。以上配合物鎔融後。再加入少量的炭酸鈵。礬土，等品。</p>
<p>（二）第二層琺瑯　這層關於製品的色澤侈美與否。所以也不可忽視。普通配合所用的原料。是長石(Feidspar)三二分。硼砂二二分。石英七分。養化錫(Stonnous　onide)一五分。炭酸鈉八分。螢石三六分。硝石(N　t　e)二二五分。再加入各種應用的顔料。但是顔料大都是金屬化合物。如養化鉛(Onide　of　lead)養化銻(Antinoky　inide)硼酸鈷(Eobalt　Silicate)等。直接都不容易鎔解。所以必須加入媒焙劑。硼砂矽酸等。都有媒焙的功用。</p>
<p>上面已經知道琺瑯原料和配合法。大槪情形了。再來略說工作方法。第一部份製坯。大都是另外一種工廠製造的。琺瑯工廠祗做琺瑯塗附工程。塗附工程是先粉碎原料。分别在坩鍋中融焙。化爲鎔液。然後將底坯一浸。充分蕩匀。手續上並不十分複雜。所難的地方。就是配合分量和所用原料的適當與否。　　末了。我再來介紹試騐琺瑯品質之優劣的一個普通方法。這方法就是先將琺瑯製品浸在沸水中數分鐘。再放在冰塊中數分鐘。如是二三次。或數次。見其表面没有裂紋。就是好的。否則就是壞的。如固要曉得製品底坯有没有鉛質。可用鷄蛋一枚。打碎。黄白拌匀。倒入琺瑯器中。靜置一晝夜。如有鉛質。就會發現黑色。因爲鷄蛋黄中有硫磺質存在。</p>

<p>— 滄萍</p>
<p>因爲吾是一個初離兒童期的靑年，關於兒童玩具的建議，從本身上聯想起來，産生了這樣自以爲是的貢獻，供大家的討論。</p>
<p>各個兒童有各樣的個性的，做父母的先要明瞭了兒童的個性，然後賜給他的玩具，興趣上比較濃厚一些，理智上也比較有益一些，所以兒童的玩具，不必拘定大刀闊斧的，就可以算爲有益的玩具。</p>
<p>根據兒童的性理，是好動的多，但是因爲先天的不足的兒童　，和環境的單調之下的兒童也有不好動的，那麽好動的兒童，再給他那大刀闊斧，必定要變成蠻動，兒童的體魄和骨骼，還没有充分發展，如果一輩子聽其蠻動，身體上也没有好處，吾以爲最適當折衷辦法，</p>
<p>對於好動的兒童，除了動的玩具之外，再給他些靜的玩具，所謂靜的玩具，像小的寫生箱，小小的文藝，有彩色的小小畫片，等等相似的兒童有趣味的讀物，最好家庭裏關一間小小的畫室，書室裏一切的數皿，都要根據了兒童的體格和心理製造，使兒童在運動之暇，休息在這一間小書室裏，隨便看看書，高興寫寫生，這樣一來，眞是寓敎育於游戲之中的辦法。</p>
<p>對於不好動的兒童，大半因爲身體軟弱，或者是環境的單調，而提不起動的興趣，做父母的，便應當設法爲兒童介紹，幾個隣舍的小朋友，買些糖菓來，維繫小朋友的感情，買個皮球來，引起小朋友的熱閙，這樣一來，不好動的自會好動，如果家庭寬大些的，最好闢一塊小小的園地，置備把小小的鋤頭，及小小的鐡剷，給兒童自已去種些花草，給兒童自已去養些生物，馴熟的狗和猫，樣樣是兒童絶好的玩具，並且在游玩之外，多少認識些自然的演進，與愛護生物的健德啊······這一些是在下的貢獻，還希望諸同文加以指正。</p>
<h3 id="c239">答程鵬君之（改良社　會討論會）馮·恒· <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>程鵬君對於上身穿學生裝下身穿短褲不贊成，他以爲</p>
<p>（甲）没有西裝的美觀，因爲像侍役一樣。</p>
<p>（乙）西裝可用布料，也可以經濟　　並非貴族化·</p>
<p>我的意見以爲難看一層，不過是因爲不普遍的緣故，至於那些笑人爲侍者的人，他自已根本就很失禮；而那人的眼光淺窄，也可以見到。</p>
<p>假使能夠一律實行之後，那也就和外國人穿西裝一樣了，有什麽好笑；穿短褲當然是可以風凉一點，如果有比較適意的法子，不去實行的，那不是呆子嗎？英國人也是穿短褲的，不知程鵬君以爲怎樣？說它不美觀嗎？那就太過於講究修飾了。說他没體統嗎？他們朝覲皇上也是穿短褲的，或者他們是夷狄之人，是没有體統的，也說不定？</p>
<p>程君說歐美工農都是西裝，這我也知道，不過是同中國工農穿中國短衫褲一樣的道理。他們有他們的風俗習慣，和我們根本不同，假使我們穿起西裝，當然要照他們的禮節和習慣，但是我仍然是中國人咧！不然如何是好？</p>
<p>程君說西裝經濟，但是請他打聽手工的價錢大約多少；，備了兩套布西裝，雖然可以免做侍者，但是仍然見不了人，因爲布西裝穿一兩天就要變樣非熨一下不可，多數人是不會熨的，於是······。要一勞永逸，而且想見人於是非呢或嗶嘰，羽紗的不可。</p>
<p>假使一有酬酢，那麽非禮服不行，否則有外國人看見了，就會搖頭。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>總之　，我以爲通常穿短衫褲也不難看，另外定一種禮服，那麽可以少受洋兒子的氣，實行也不困難。</p>
<p>女子的大腿一層，我以爲若然天氣太冷，她們當然穿不成絲襪，這到不要担心。有碍風化一層，讓那些意淫的人多見就不會作怪，假使不幸短命死矣，那也是自作自受，像投黄浦的人一樣，不必援手的。（却酬）</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>自從（戀愛自由）的口號，從歐西各國進貢到中國來以後，向來抱男女隔絶，老死不相往來的，一般中國人，頓時轉變了觀念；而同時，（社交公開）（男女平等）等口號，也不約而同的漸漸地廣佈於中國各地。而一般的靑年，到達了相當年齡以後，異性的追求，便視爲一種急切的要務了。</p>
<p>但在今日的情狀之下，社交公開的聲浪，雖遍於各地，而交際手段靈活的男子，本不難找到女友，至交際手段不靈活的，那要找到一位女友，確是一個困難的問題了。在這種局面之下，因而一般血氣未定的靑年，爲了找不到異性朋友，有時竟會窮思極想，向着不相識的女子去求愛，說來眞非凡的可憐呢！　　向朋友方面打聽到女人的名字，在報紙上看到女人的名字，甚至到女學校的門房之中，去抄幾個女生的名字，回到校裏，便不管三七二十一，寫信去，一封没有回信兩封，兩封没有三封·········無窮盡的寄去。到了自已覺得没興的時候，才告一個段落。</p>
<p>Ｃ女士，她在某女校讀書，最近也一連接到了三封求愛式的情書。那寫信的人，不要說面都没有見過，連名字都不認識。從這一點上，我們便可證明他所以知道Ｃ女士的芳名，不是從朋友口中探到的，便是在報紙上看見的，也許到某女校的門房中抄來的。</p>
<p>Ｃ女士是一個很會作刁的女子，當她接到那不相識的男子，第一封來信的時候，不去復他，第二封也是不復，直到第三封，她才想出了一個妙計，寫了一封回信去，約他在星期日午後二時，在永安和先施的交义地，那位紅頭阿三司紅綠燈的鐡臺之下相會，作一度的談話，並且說明自已穿的是一件淡紅的旗袍。</p>
<p>星期日的下午到了，Ｃ女士約了兩位女支，吃了飯便走到大馬路去，立在永安公司的角子上，向着鐡臺望着，但他們三人，穿的都不是淡紅旗袍。等到將近兩點鐘的時候，果然有一位西裝少年興匆匆的走到鐡臺之下，東張西望，似乎在找什麽人的樣子。</p>
<p>他在交义點向兩面的走道上望了好久，但找不到一個穿淡紅旗袍的女郎，雖是在行人之中，偶然也許有穿紅衣服的女人雜在裏面，但她們都不停留，各走各的路，顯然没有什麽約會，終於在希望之中，他慢慢的覺得失望起來了，</p>
<p>眞是急得他要命呢！</p>
<p>其實，約他的人，就在角子上，不過他不認識她吧了，害得她們看見他這副情狀，忍不住在暗笑，後來她們便走開了，便他却没有走，還在希望她來呢。可是就是等到明天，也不會來了，白害他換了一套新西裝，到馬路裏來曬太陽。這也是瞎寫情書者，所得到的一種酬報吧？</p>

<p>— 紅</p>
<p>我有一位幽閑賢淑的表姊，做姑娘的時候，她父母眞當她心肝五臟般的寳貝，後來嫁給一個同鄕紳士家裏做媳婦，丈夫待她是很好的，可是姑娘小叔太多了，平　　　　　　　　日子，人多口多，不容易</p>
<p>做人，婆總是維護子女的，事情雖是她對的，有時亦祇好忍氣陪笑臉，這種日子，在她已經過得十分委曲的了，偏是事有凑巧，禍不單行，在這時候，一個好生是非的鄰婦對她說，她的丈夫在上海有了姘婦，已把她置諸九霄雲外了，這原是與她開頑笑的，不料這幾句話，在她苦悶的心裏，起了巨大的波濤，從那天起，態度大變，終日閉門獨臥，一些生氣都没有，她娘知道了，連忙接她回來住，但是她神經上受了打擊，已經開始患神經病了，她見没人的時候，總是跪在地下拜，或是偷偷的到廚房裏去把刀藏起來，等到家人發現廚刀不見了，各人心裏恐慌了一陣，便到她的身上和房内去搜尋，唉······她已起了自殺的念頭了。</p>
<p>一天，她的舅母來了，家裏自然要好好的招待她，晚上我們打雀牌，到十點鐘，姑母便吩咐老媽子陪她上樓去睡，不料到一點鐘的光景，我們的大門，敲得像連鼓一般的響，把我們四個人，</p>
<p>在座位上直跳起來，接着更是彭···彭···彭···的亂敲，姑夫便呌男僕去開門，誰知一開了門，就有一羣癟三和流氓，爭先恐後的蜂擁進來，同時嘴裏嚷道··（你家小姐，在西門投河自盡了，快遣人去認領罷！）（就要斷氣哩！讓我們去把她抬回來好麽？）</p>
<p>姑夫聽了衆人的話，氣得鬍子都翹了起來，憤憤的道··（打嘴！不要胡扯！我家小姐好好的睡在床上，你們眞在活見鬼，）說完了話，門碰的關上丁。　　隔了半個時晨，大門上又起了一陣亂打。而且外邊人聲鼎沸，呀！他們又來報信麽？姑母這時疑信參半，乃快移蓮步，上樓去看個究竟，一走進伊女兒的房，竟使伊呆住了，原來床上空洞洞的，床底下啊，衣廚裏啊，牆角裏啊，都找遍了，可是連半個影子也没有，這時伊才肯定了，那個投河的，一定是伊的阿翠了，伊奔下樓，臉色慘白得可怕，倒在椅裏，便敎來人去把女屍抬來，她們聽了這話，好像奉了聖旨一般，風一陣的都去了，不到一刻鐘，又僵又冷的翠姐，已經呈入我們的眼簾了，於是家人嚎啕大哭聲，和流氓癟三的敲詐聲，嚷成一片，唉······她就這樣毁滅了她自已，撇下了她唯一的三歲親生女兒，去依靠那風燭殘年的外婆過日子。</p>
<p>她丈夫得到了這個兇訊，星夜趕回，撫屍大慟，泣不成聲，親友羣相責難，可憐他有口難辯。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Righteous Army and Japanese Immigrants <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, triumphant reports from the righteous army have been frequently received. They attacked Yingkou, occupied Tongliao, and conquered Lienshan, and also issued an ultimatum to the Japanese side to return Jinzhou to us. The influence of their momentum has brought comfort to all the people. If they continue to advance courageously, then this action by the righteous army will not only uplift our national spirit but also deal a significant blow to Japanese immigrants. Please let me explain this further.</p>
<p>According to a report in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun a few weeks ago, “The military intends to negotiate with the Manchurian puppet government to select land along the Manchurian Railway and the Jidun Railway, agree on its price, and distribute it fairly to establish the fundamental policy of Japanese immigration to Manchuria. At the same time, Japanese immigrants will adopt the Tuntian Bing (military-agricultural colony) system, with graduates of the training school next spring serving as leaders of the groups. Currently, the Kwantung Army has completed its investigation and considers suitable immigration areas to be several locations along the Manchurian Railway near Dagushan, Liaoyang, Tieling, the Jidun area, and the Sanxing area.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 4th, “The Japanese Army Ministry plans to spend 15 million yen to immigrate 10,000 people to northern Manchuria. The qualifications for immigration are limited to volunteers among veterans.”</p>
<p>The Japanese immigration to the Northeast has been its traditional policy for decades. However, due to the vast differences in climate, the results have been minimal. Therefore, in the last decade, it has changed its original plan to the policy of “transferring Japanese to Korea and then Koreans to Manchuria.” However, the purpose of this armed immigration policy by the Japanese military is apparently not just simple immigration but actually holds a variety of political meanings.</p>
<p>Today, righteous armies are rising like bees and surging like clouds in various places in the three eastern provinces. Although Japan has sophisticated weapons and equipment, it still cannot slightly blunt their spirit. The rise of our righteous army is motivated by a sense of national consciousness. Therefore, for several months, they fall but are succeeded by others. The Japanese side has felt exhausted and is rushing to armed immigration to fill in where the Japanese army has fallen short. This is one of the meanings of the recent immigration by the Japanese military.</p>
<p>Secondly, after Japan instigated the rebels to establish a puppet state, it took over customs, seized postal rights, and did whatever it wanted without any scruples. Although it shirks responsibility to the Manchurian puppet state to appease international public opinion, on the other hand, Japan is still concerned about future changes in international attitudes. The report of the recent investigation team has already begun to be compiled. It is difficult to predict the conclusion. Therefore, to prepare for a rainy day, Japan cannot but consolidate its forces in Manchuria in advance so that once the investigation team or the international community does not recognize the Manchurian puppet state but still recognizes the Northeast as our country's territory, then Japan can still use its immigrant forces in Manchuria to resist. This is another meaning of the recent immigration by the Japanese military. Now the righteous army is fiercely attacking the southern Manchurian Railway line. In fact, it has already given an enormous threat to the Japanese immigration policy. Japan will certainly do everything it can to suppress it. If the righteous army eventually fails due to lack of support, then not only will the Japanese immigration policy succeed, but there will also be no hope of recovering the Northeast.</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Righteous Army's Momentum in Liaoning Province Is Increasing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The righteous army repeatedly attacks Haicheng, Yingkou, Nantai and other places</p>
<p>Japanese commercial and industrial activities along the South Manchurian Railway come to a standstill</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Today, the South Manchurian Railway line is being attacked by the righteous army. There are fierce battles in various places along the line, including Fenshui, Tashan, Daleidian, Nantai, Liaoyang, Shenyang, Haicheng, Yingkou, and Dashiqiao. The Dashiqiao water reservoir was bombed, the Fenshui train station was burned, and the Japanese warehouses in Haicheng were turned to ashes. The Japanese along the route are pale and loudly criticizing the incompetence of the military. Trains cannot run on the entire line, and Japanese commercial and industrial institutions have come to a standstill. (5th, China United Press)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, it was learned that there are fierce battles in various areas along the South Manchurian Railway. The righteous army has repeatedly attacked the sea area, Yingkou, Nantai, Dashiqiao, and other places. Therefore, the South Manchurian main line has had to suspend night trains, which is unprecedented. It is heard that the number and strength of the righteous army have both increased. For this reason, Lieutenant General Mori and other senior civil and military officials held a meeting in Shenyang this morning to discuss effective methods to protect the railway. Honjo has received strict instructions from Tokyo to deal with the enemy crowd. Furthermore, the Army Ministry announced to the newspapers last night that the sudden activities of the Manchurian righteous army must have been orchestrated behind the scenes by Zhang Xueliang and his subordinates. Therefore, resolute measures may need to be taken against Zhang and others. The whereabouts of Ishimoto are variously reported. However, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun now claims that Zhang Xueliang's 500 troops have arrived in Chaoyang. It is rumored that Zhang has ordered 150,000 members of the righteous army to gather there. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese legation has received a telegram from Shenyang describing the battle situation in Niuzhuang and other places in South Manchuria. The Japanese authorities claim that the anti-Manchu army has been driven out of Niuzhuang Town, but also admit that they still need to hold the town to prevent further attacks by the anti-Manchu army. This battle has been unusually fierce, as the Japanese authorities have stated that the anti-Manchu army penetrated deep into the town and fought bravely in street battles with the Japanese soldiers.

<p>(Shenyang) At 3:00 PM today, about 100 members of the righteous army attacked the Beidaying ammunition depot outside of Shenyang City and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese garrison. Both sides are currently engaged in battle. (5th, China United Press)</p>

<p>(Shenyang) Since the righteous army in western Liaoning attacked the South Manchurian Railway line, the Japanese residents in various places have been trembling with fear and unable to live and work in peace. Trains are not running, and commercial and industrial activities have come to a standstill. The Japanese military is in a great panic and held a full-line security conference at the South Manchurian Railway Company at 1:00 PM this afternoon. Attendees included the Kwantung Army, the South Manchurian Railway, and the Kwantung Government. The contents of the resolutions passed at the joint conference are unknown. (5th, China United Press)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army withdrew from Tongliao on the night of the 2nd. The righteous army completely occupied the area on the 3rd. The Japanese army retreated to Zhangwu County. The Qianjinzai Coal Mine, 20 li away from Shenyang, was also occupied by the righteous army. Du Fangzhou of the righteous army notified the Jinzhou train station, demanding that Jinzhou be returned within 48 hours; otherwise, they would attack. The Japanese army in Jinzhou has begun to prepare for battle. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Eight Japanese warships arrived at Huludao and shelled Zheng Guilin's troops. More than 300 Japanese army soldiers assisted. Fierce fighting occurred on the morning of the 4th. To avoid the Japanese artillery fire, the righteous army was dispersed into the surrounding sorghum fields to fight. About 600 members of the righteous army from a part of Jin county set out to support Lienshan on the 4th. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) After our country blockaded postal services in the Northeast, Japanese residents in places such as Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Qingdao illegally established their own postal services, using various destructive methods to obstruct our country's blockade policy and postal sovereignty. Furthermore, Japan is also engaged in monopolizing telecommunications in the eastern provinces. Without seeking our country's consent, it has notified the International Telecommunication Union that telegrams between the three northeastern provinces and other countries will be forwarded by Japan. This not only damages China's sovereignty but also violates the provisions of the Sino-Japanese telegraph agreement. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has separately lodged a protest with Japan.

<p>Land on Both Banks of the Songhua River Inundated</p>
<p>Traffic on the Chinese Eastern Railway Completely Halted</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Songhua River and other rivers are currently in flood, and the water is rushing straight ahead. Land on both banks is under water, and countless lives have been lost. The material losses are even impossible to calculate. Furthermore, the main transportation lines of the three eastern provinces have also been disrupted. Five thousand road workers from the Railway Bureau, divided into fifty trains, are fighting the water, but ultimately, they cannot reverse the situation. The Chinese Eastern Railway has no choice but to suspend traffic. Today, the Traffic Management Office has issued a notice of suspension. Thousands of trains have been cut off by the water. The required food is being dropped by airplanes for use. This flood is probably unprecedented in the history of the three eastern provinces. The number of lives lost must be very high, but it is currently impossible to estimate accurately. The left bank of the Songhua River has been completely flooded. On the right bank, the water is currently spreading to Chuanjiadian and other places. The homes of residents have mostly been submerged, and their suffering is imaginable. The river water is still continuing to rise, and the higher the water level, the wider the extent of the disaster. The people are very frightened. Three bridges on the southern section of the railway, about 45 miles from Harbin, have been washed away. The roadbed nine miles west of Qiqihar has also been washed away. The disaster situation in Tiangang and other places is also severe. Several miles of low-lying land within Sanxing have also become a swamp. Currently, the only thing that is somewhat reassuring is that the water level of the Ashi River has slightly decreased. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news from Harbin received by foreigners, after Harbin suffered a major flood, there is now an outbreak of plague, and the number of deaths is increasing. Since the flood, countless Chinese and Russian poor people in Harbin and the surrounding areas and northern Manchuria have been rendered homeless. However, the flood is not without its benefits. Because Qiqihar is now blocked by water, fighting is impossible, and the people can be somewhat at peace. (5th, Reuters)</p>

<p>The Ministry of Auditing Sends Personnel to Investigate and Confirm Truth</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Members Propose Impeachment</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Supervisory Committee members Luo Jie-fu impeached Tan Chang-kai, head of the Hunan Construction Department, alleging that from September 18th to December of the 20th year of the Republic [1931], he secretly sold sand to Japan for the manufacture of military supplies. The Ministry of Auditing sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the truth of the matter. It was stated that during the deep crisis caused by the Japanese invaders in the Northeast, any Chinese with a shred of patriotism should devise ways to resist and curb the enemy's arrogance. However, Tan Chang-kai, the head of the Hunan Construction Department, greedy for profit, secretly made arrangements with the Japanese to transport and sell various lead ores, which are materials for manufacturing military supplies, to the Northeast, which served as tools to brutally kill our compatriots. Such behavior is no different from supplying the enemy with grain. The department head, Tan Chang-kai, willingly betrayed the country and is indeed insane and extremely sinful. It is proposed that he be impeached according to law, immediately removed from office, handed over for disciplinary action, and severely punished. The Supervisory Yuan has already assigned this case to the review committee members Zhou Jue, Zhou Lisheng, and Tian Jiongjin for review. The committee members all agreed that at a time when the whole country is resisting Japan, the department head actually sold military supply ores to the enemy, which is no different from aiding the enemy with grain and willingly betraying the country. Since the facts have been verified, he should be handed over for disciplinary action. The results of the review have been submitted to the Yuan for review and implementation.

He asked Feng whether he had fully recovered from his illness, as reported in the newspapers. Feng replied that he was not sick and had come here to cultivate his mind, not to recover from an illness. When the investigation team visited Mount Tai, they wanted to see me, but because China has lost three provinces and cannot recover them on its own, but instead begs others for help, I felt ashamed to face people, so I used illness as an excuse to decline. Now that Rehe is also in a critical situation, if we still do not resist, then North China will be in danger, so I am very anxious and cannot sleep at night, and I have a toothache all day long. This does not count as an illness. Recently, I heard that the generals in North China are meeting in Beiping to discuss measures to defend against the enemy. If they can work together to defend the territory, there is still hope for China's future, otherwise it will be difficult to say.

<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian today published excerpts from remarks by Guo Taiqi, the new Chinese ambassador to England, stating that Japan's adventurous attempts in Manchuria are bound to fail. The Japanese cannot prosper by settling in the cold plains of Manchuria and competing with 30 million Chinese. The Japanese initially said that after occupying Manchuria, they would definitely make the area peaceful and prosperous, but instead caused endless unrest. Farmers' production has been greatly reduced, resulting in the South Manchuria Railway, which used to make a profit of 80 million Japanese yen, now suffering losses. There are currently less than 200,000 Japanese residents in Manchuria, and this number includes a large number of road workers and a large army stationed along the South Manchuria Railway. Therefore, due to these circumstances, coupled with Japan's serious situation, Manchuria is not a benefit to Japan, but a burden. Ambassador Guo concluded by saying that China hopes that the League of Nations' investigation report can show that a fair and honorable solution can be found through the League of Nations, which can maintain the prestige of the League of Nations and maintain lasting peace in the Far East.

According to this, this is the latest development in the Imperial Conference.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Ottawa, 4th After the Imperial Conference waited quietly for the colonies to propose methods of balanced trade that are mutually beneficial for nearly five days, today it discussed the British proposals regarding the amount of British anthracite to be exported to Canada, proposing to increase it from 900,000 tons to 1.4 million tons per year. The discussion was particularly lengthy. The British representatives believe that this move will have little actual impact on the United States. Proposals such as giving preferential treatment to British textiles and South African wheat and Canadian meat exports to Canada were also discussed.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Extensive Employment of Advisors <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Dalian Dispatch: Recently, the Kwantung Army has extensively hired Japanese advisors and (consultants) to further its operations. This matter is of utmost importance to our nation's future and requires urgent attention from our compatriots within the Great Wall. Therefore, we record its outline as follows:</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the puppet government in the Northeast on March 9th, the Japanese militarists have acted with brutality and arrogance between the Black River and White Mountains, congratulating themselves on the success of their continental policy. They have expanded their former Kwantung Army Special Affairs Department, extensively recruiting famous figures from the Japanese government and public to serve as committee members or advisors, as a general headquarters for future invasions of Manchuria. Within the reorganized Kwantung Army Special Affairs Department, the following committees have been established: (1) Finance, Currency, Customs, Taxation, and Fiscal Committee; (2) Railways, Telegraphs, Telephones, Rivers, and Ports Committee; (3) Commerce, Industry, Agriculture, Forestry, Electricity, Waterworks, and General Industries Committee. Each committee employs eight Japanese committee members, and several (consultants) are also hired. The Special Affairs Department Director is concurrently held by the Kwantung Army Chief of Staff, but the director only manages affairs within the committee and has no voting rights. Currently, the appointed consultants to the Special Affairs Department include Mr. Suzuki Takeo and Mr. Ando Hirotaro. Mr. Suzuki is the former Vice President of the Bank of Korea and now serves as a consultant to the Special Affairs Department's Finance and Currency Committee. Mr. Ando was originally the Director of the Japanese Agricultural Experiment Station and a professor at Tokyo Imperial University, and now serves as a consultant to the Special Affairs Department's Agriculture Committee.</p>
<p>The Kwantung Army has recently appointed the following advisors: Mr. Yoshida Toyohiko, Mr. Saito Ryoei, Mr. Oshima Yoshikiyo, and Mr. Fujine Jukichi. Mr. Yoshida is the former Chief of the Technical Headquarters, previously an advisor on weaponry and mining metallurgy. Mr. Saito is the former director of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR) and now serves as an international law advisor. Mr. Oshima is a former professor at Tokyo Imperial University and now serves as a mining advisor. Mr. Fujine is a former director of the SMR and now serves as a transportation advisor.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese military authorities, the appointment of the Kwantung Army advisors and Special Affairs Department consultants is a transitional measure. In the unified four-head political system plan for Manchuria, there is a provision to appoint advisors with rich (academic knowledge and) experience to provide counsel on full authority. Therefore, when the General Supervisory Office for the unified four-head political system emerges in the future, these Kwantung Army advisors and consultants will transform into consultants to the General Supervisory Office. The term "Kwantung Army advisor" is merely a temporary transitional term. Among the aforementioned advisors and consultants, Mr. Yoshida and Mr. Suzuki have already arrived in Fengtian (Mukden), while Mr. Saito, Mr. Ando, and others are expected to arrive soon. Their every move is of great significance, and we must pay close attention to them. (Rongchuan)</p>
<p>U.S. Presidential Election</p>
<h3 id="e95">And the Manchurian Question <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>▲Japanese hope for a Democratic victory</p>
<p>▲Saying it will be beneficial to Japan diplomatically</p>
<p>The Tokyo Yorozu News reports: The U.S. presidential election in November is fast approaching. It is still difficult to predict who will win the final crown. However, the two major U.S. political parties have different foreign policies and stances on Far Eastern issues. The Republican Party's foreign policy is characterized by imperialism, activism, and expansionism, while the Democratic Party is the opposite. Let us examine the relationship between the two parties and the Far East and Japan. In 1853, during the tenure of Republican President Fillmore, Commodore Perry was dispatched to Japan. The letter he carried was drafted by Secretary of State Webster. In 1898, the U.S. annexed the Philippines and Hawaii. The following year, President McKinley, also a Republican, advocated the Open Door Policy in China. In 1905, during the Harriman era, after the Russo-Japanese War, the U.S. opposed Japan's exclusive control over the Manchurian Railway, attempting to purchase it but failing. During the presidencies of President Taft and Secretary of State Knox, another proposal for the Manchurian Railway was made, but it was opposed by Japan, leading to the pursuit of the Jinzhou-Aigun Railway and repeated conflicts with Japan. Soon after, Taft stepped down, and Democrat Wilson became president, with Bryan as Secretary of State, suddenly withdrawing from the Six-Power Consortium loan to China. However, as Wilson's term was coming to an end, the Shandong issue arose. In 1920, Republican Harding was elected president and returned the Shandong rights obtained by Japan to China. At the London Naval Treaty in 1930, Japan's plans were strongly obstructed. Last year, the Manchurian Incident erupted, and Republican President Hoover and Secretary of State Stimson echoed the League of Nations, repeatedly</p>
<p>poured hot water on Japan's back. This year is another presidential election year. Judging from the current situation, it is extremely difficult for the Republican Party to win. First, the Republican Party has been in power for three consecutive terms, totaling twelve years. The American people have grown tired of the party. Second, in recent years, the Republican Party's economic failures have dissatisfied the public. Third, half of the House of Representatives members have been re-elected, and the number of Republican senators is also weaker than that of the Democrats. Based on these three points, it may be impossible for the Republican Party to regain the presidency. However, it is still too early, and the final outcome is still uncertain. If a Democratic government is established after March next year, what will be the U.S. foreign policy toward the Far East? This is a matter of great concern to us. Let us first examine the general outline decided by the Democratic platform committee during the presidential nominating convention in Chicago in July: (1) Support the independence of the Philippines; (2) Maintain world peace and resolve international disputes through arbitration; (3) Not interfere in other countries' internal affairs and respect treaties. When other international peace treaties are threatened, advocate holding international conferences for discussion to give full play to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. From this perspective, if the Democratic Party wins this U.S. election, while it may not completely ignore the Manchurian issue, it will certainly not obstruct Japan at every turn like the Republican Party. It will also not intervene in international disputes with military force. Therefore, a Democratic victory could be beneficial to Japan.</p>
<p>According to the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, during the Democratic convention in Chicago on July 1st, the fourth round of voting resulted in New York Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt being nominated as the next Democratic presidential candidate. The Republican Party nominated the current President Hoover again. The Democratic Party also nominated House Speaker John Nance Garner as the vice-presidential candidate, while the Republican Party nominated Charles Curtis. Roosevelt is a progressive politician of the Democratic Party who strongly advocates nationalizing electricity, so many states in the eastern U.S. oppose him. However, Hoover's prosperity policies have long failed, and his prestige has declined. The Republican Party expresses dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party's nomination of Roosevelt. The competition between the two major politicians is becoming increasingly intense, and it will inevitably have a significant impact on the Far Eastern situation in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e96">White Russian Independence Movement <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Planning to use Shenyang as a base</p>
<p>Establishing White Russian military villages in Manchuria</p>
<p>The clandestine activities of White Russians in North Manchuria have long been reported in various newspapers. Japan, in order to contain Russia and to exploit the wisdom of the puppet state's traitors, is also actively inciting the White Russians to conspire for a Siberian independence movement. According to the Tokyo Kokumin Shimbun of the 29th, White Russians, scattered around the world, have been very active in Manchuria since May. General Petrov, Chief of Staff of the Far Eastern Branch of the White Russian Military Alliance, will come to Japan soon, his mission being</p>
<p>to (recover their homeland and promote the establishment of an independent Siberia). Chairman Hunting will also come to Japan in mid-August. Colonel Boldyrev has been working diligently in Japan since last year. The plan to establish a new country has gradually surfaced. Therefore, key figures in the Japanese government are unusually excited. It is now found that their plan is to first build White Russian military villages in Manchuria, then gather 300,000 soldiers to attempt to reclaim their homeland. Petrov, Minister of War during the former Omsk government, after Manchuria's independence, agreed with Hunting in April of this year to move the Shanghai headquarters to Shenyang, and repeatedly consulted with key figures from the Manchurian government, the South Manchuria Railway authorities, and the Kwantung Army headquarters. They have now gathered 60,000 White Russian soldiers, and have also received assistance from Dr. Pegelow, dispatched by the Siberian State Assembly, to send letters to White Russians scattered around the world, planning methods for Siberian independence.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Chiang Orders the Suppression of Communist Bandits in Five Provinces Within Six Months <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Promulgating Regulations for Rewards and Punishments During the Bandit Suppression Period</p>
<p>County Magistrates Concurrently Serving as Military Judges Have the Power to Arrest Local Bandits and Communists</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: Since Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Hankou, established the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for the Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, and announced the commanders and deputy commanders of the three routes (left, center, and right), the military campaign against the Communist forces has become increasingly intense. The left route has made the fastest progress, and the remnants of He Long's forces have been almost completely destroyed. Victories have also been reported in southern Henan and northern Anhui. The search for scattered bandits and the handling of post-bandit suppression affairs are currently underway. Chiang is eager to seize the opportunity to eliminate the remaining bandits and avoid future troubles. Therefore, on the 3rd of this month, after returning to Hankou from Xunyang, he resolved to completely suppress the remaining Communist bandits in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, and Anhui within six months. He also ordered that the efforts of all civil and military officers and soldiers during the bandit suppression period should be strictly examined, and that rewards and punishments should be meted out without fail. He specifically promulgated the Regulations for Rewards and Punishments for Civil and Military Officers and Soldiers During the Bandit Suppression Period, which consists of six chapters: (1) General Principles; (2) Standards for Rewards and Punishments; (3) Regulations for Rewards and Punishments; (4) Procedures for Rewards and Punishments; (5) Implementation of Rewards and Punishments; (6) Supplementary Provisions. Punishments are divided into five types: execution by firing squad, imprisonment, demotion, demerit, and reprimand. Rewards are divided into six types: promotion, advancement, medals, merit, bonuses, and commendations. The promulgation of these regulations will greatly benefit the bandit suppression campaign. At the same time, Chiang also issued a circular to all civil and military officers and soldiers in the bandit suppression areas to comply with the regulations. The circular stated: (This is a circular. In recent years, civil and military officers have developed a habit of laziness and corruption, and discipline has collapsed, leading to the gradual decline of local areas and the increasing prevalence of banditry. After thoroughly researching the causes, it is all due to the failure to distinguish between right and wrong and the lack of clear rewards and punishments, resulting in a loss of incentive and a decline in political performance. The Commander-in-Chief is aware of this and has specifically formulated the Regulations for Rewards and Punishments for Civil and Military Officers and Soldiers During the Bandit Suppression Period and promulgated them for implementation. In addition to separate orders, the regulations are hereby sent to you for your compliance and to instruct your subordinates to comply. After the regulations are promulgated, all civil and military officers and soldiers who can cultivate their spirit, perform their duties effectively, and achieve results will be rewarded, even if they are minor officials. Those who continue in their old ways, are greedy, negligent, cowardly, or opportunistic, even if they hold high positions, will not be tolerated. It must be known that the Commander-in-Chief promotes the upright and punishes the corrupt, and rewards and punishments are meted out without fail. Each must comply without deviation. This order.) The Military Law Department of the General Headquarters has now been established, with Qiu Ao concurrently serving as the director, and all disciplinary actions will be handled by the department in the future. As for counties far from Hankou, it is difficult to implement emergency measures in a timely manner. A month ago, Chiang summoned the county magistrates to the provincial capital for meetings and training sessions, conferred military ranks on the county magistrates (major general for large counties, colonel for medium and small counties), and personally instructed them that if garrisoned troops were oppressive, they could report to the General Headquarters for execution. On the 4th of this month, he also appointed the county magistrates in the bandit suppression areas as military judges of the General Headquarters, who have the power to arrest and interrogate lawless soldiers, Communist bandits, ordinary bandits, and local traitors in their respective counties. These provisional regulations and the regulations of the Military Law Department of the General Headquarters have been approved by Chiang and will be promulgated soon. (August 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e98">He Jian Decides to Rectify the Finances of Various Counties in Hunan Province <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Various Taxes and Levies Should Be Under the Unified Management of the Financial Bureau</p>
<p>Various Exorbitant and Miscellaneous Taxes in Each County Should Be Abolished</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The finances of various counties in Hunan Province have always been extremely chaotic. Not only are revenues and expenditures divided and never unified, but there are also many surtaxes and levies with numerous names. Even a single maritime grain certificate has one or two dozen surtax stamps on it. In all 75 counties of the province, surcharges on land taxes exceed the regular tax by more than ten times in some cases, and at least two or three times in others. The people bear a heavy burden and suffer greatly. When He Jian went to Hengzhou last month to convene a public affairs conference with the county magistrates, security team leaders, and representatives of public legal organizations from the 25 counties in southern Hunan, he met with people from various counties and talked about the financial situation, believing that it was necessary to actively rectify it. After returning to the province, he instructed Zhang Kailian, the Director of the Finance Department, to draft a rectification plan for submission and approval. The order stated the chaotic financial situation of the various counties with great concern, and is recorded as follows: (The rise and fall of county administration depends on the success or failure of county finance. Now is the time for innovation, and everything is waiting to be addressed, especially the rectification of finances is urgent. The way to manage finances is nothing more than unified revenue and expenditure and suitable revenue and expenditure. During my recent trip to Hengyang to inspect the politics of various counties, I consulted on various matters, and regarding finance, I often failed to obtain unified and suitable revenue and expenditure. Generally, the basic income of each county is land tax surcharge. Each tael of regular tax has a surcharge ranging from five or six yuan to more than ten or twenty yuan. The names of the surcharges are numerous and complicated, and the most serious problem is the separate collection by various agencies, which are not unified and paid by the Finance Bureau. As for education, relief, and public security, which have specific income, the Finance Bureau cannot interfere. In this situation, the annual budget is just empty talk. Even in counties that are managed relatively well, although they are nominally unified, they are actually managed separately. Therefore, their so-called suitable revenue and expenditure is far from the truth. The impact is that the people bear an increasing burden, and the county administration is declining. Those who take advantage of the financial chaos to engage in corruption are inevitable. Only by actively clearing up and rectifying can we eliminate abuses and encourage integrity. In the future, the financial income of each county, regardless of the source of taxes or the purpose of expenditure, must be submitted to the Finance Bureau of each county for unified collection and payment. Even land tax surcharges or other income designated for specific expenses should also be submitted to the Finance Bureau for collection and payment, and then paid according to the original plan. The relevant departments must not collect and pay by themselves. The industries originally managed by various agencies should include the interest income in the annual budget by the County Finance Bureau. In short, without unified county finance and suitable revenue and expenditure, county administration cannot proceed. It is the duty of the Finance Department to formulate a rectification plan based on the above principles, submit it to the Provincial Government Committee for resolution, and order compliance. As for the exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes in each county, such as the business protection tax in Linwu, Lanshan, and Lingling counties, the pig and cattle tax in Yizhang county, and similar names in other counties, they should also be ordered to be abolished and alternative funds raised to alleviate the people's difficulties. Hereby order the Finance Department to comply and report the verification. This order.) (August 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Five Provinces Launch a Large-Scale Encirclement and Suppression of Communist Bandits <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Fujian Army Moves from Tingzhou and Hangzhou Towards Ruijin and Shicheng</p>
<p>The Guangdong Army Advances from the Northeast Towards Xinfeng and Yudu</p>
<p>Troops Stationed on Both Banks of the Gan River Suppress Xingguo and Ningdu</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: After Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, Ji Zhentong, Lin Biao, and Luo Binghui's various Communist bandit factions were defeated in northern Guangdong and retreated to southern Jiangxi, they originally intended to flee west to Hunan and Hubei. Fortunately, the Central Army acted quickly, and a large number of reinforcements were added to Ganzhou and the west bank of the Gan River in the shortest possible time to cut off the escape route of the Communist bandits. According to front-line news, the battles of Nanxiong, Zhongzhan, Dazheng, Qinglong, Nankang, and Xinchi were a desperate gamble for the Communist bandits, and the number of casualties and losses was enormous. Afterwards, the Guangdong troops on the front line were successively transferred back to the rear for reorganization and replenishment, and fresh troops were transferred to the planned offensive locations for deployment. The bandits also wanted to take a breather while our side was still deploying defenses. Therefore, the main force of the Communist bandit army under the command of Zhu, Mao, Peng, Lin, Ji, and Luo (the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, and 12th armies) is still forming a confrontational situation with the Guangdong army in the Jiudushui Dabao (south of Ganzhou) and Xiashawu areas at the junction of Xinfeng, Nankang, and Ganxian. Moreover, the Communist bandit leaders secretly recognize their respective spheres of influence, often clashing with each other, fleeing or fighting in the east and west, and each has different opinions. Now He Yingqin, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, He Jian, and Cai Tingkai believe that the Communist bandits are temporarily gathered in the so-called Central District of Jiangxi Province (more than ten counties in southeastern Jiangxi and Guangdong), which is a great opportunity to gather and annihilate them. Therefore, the troops of the five provinces are preparing to actively attack, but they still adhere to the principle of gradual advancement and steady progress. According to military news, the new deployments of the various armies are as follows: A. The main force of the Guangdong army has successively arrived in</p>
<p>Xinfeng and Anyuan, advancing towards Jiudushui Datang, and will recover Xinfeng to take Anyuan and Yudu. B. The 19th Route Army of Fujian has passed Hexi and Huafeng and will send one route from Wuping and Shanghang to Xunzhang, connect with the Guangdong army in eastern Jiangxi, and take the south of Ruijin. A part will go from Tingzhou to Shicheng, taking the west of Ruijin. At present, the Communist bandits in the Tingzhou and Hangzhou area have a tendency to retreat entirely into Jiangxi. C. On the Jiangxi side, the troops on the east bank of the Gan River were originally mainly defensive, but have recently changed from defensive to offensive. For example, the troops of Mao Bingwen, Xu Kexiang, and Li Yunjie in Nanfeng have been advancing south towards Guangchang since the 25th of last month, heading for Ningdu. Mao's troops have now recovered the old nest of the 4th division at Ganzhu and Kuzhu. At the same time, a column composed of the 8th and 24th divisions has moved from Kangdu on the Jiangxi-Fujian border to block the bandits from Ninghua and Jianning, cooperating with friendly forces in northwestern Fujian. The troops of Sun Lianzhong, originally in Yihuang, are not far from Wangbi and Xiaobu in Ningdu after capturing Huangpi and Zhaoxie. This place was originally garrisoned by Xiao Ke's 5th Division, but it has retreated west to Yongfeng. There are no large bandits in the Guangchang area, only a small number of shuttle bandits and peasant bandits. On the west bank of the Gan River, after Chen Cheng's troops were transferred to the area above Ganzhou, the Gan River coast from Ganzhou to Ji'an was garrisoned by Wang Maode, Luo Zhuoying, and other divisions. Now Chen's troops are completely deployed near Ganzhou, connected with the Guangdong army in the south and the Hunan army in the west, preventing the bandits from attacking Ganzhou and fleeing west into Hunan. At the same time, they are also preventing Peng Dehuai from attacking Ganzhou after circumventing the Guangdong-Hunan border. After Chen's troops concentrated in the Ganzhou area, Wu Qihai's troops also joined the Ji'an line. Commander Wu has also arrived in Ji'an to discuss defense handover and other matters with Chen Cheng, and will immediately attack the notorious bandit nests of Futian, Donggu, and Longgang, heading straight for Xingguo and Yudu, to join forces with friendly forces from Fujian and Guangdong in Ruijin. Overall, the Communist bandits are indeed surrounded by the armies of the five provinces. There are also rumors that a general offensive has been ordered on August 1st, but the military authorities are keeping it secret. (August 3rd)</p>

<p>The Hai Rui and Fu An Warships Return to the Provincial River</p>
<p>Plans to Salvage the Sunken Feiying Warship</p>
<p>The Yingjie Warship Spontaneously Combusts and Sinks in Guangzhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: After the Qiongzhou Incident came to an end, the Qiongya Pacification Commissioner appointed by Chen Jitang took the Haihu warship from Leizhou to Qiongzhou on July 27th, and immediately set up an office in Haikou to start working. The county magistrates of Qiongshan, Qiongdong, Anding, Chengmai, Changjiang, and Wan'ning, newly appointed by the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government, also arrived in Haikou on the 26th to take over their respective counties. The Qiongya Special Region, which was resolved by the Southwest Political Committee, has now appeared like a bubble. Currently, the security of Qiongya is entirely maintained by the Chen Hanguang Division of the Guard Brigade. There are no fewer than four or five thousand Communist bandits in Qiongya, who took advantage of the change of troops by the government army to carry out a lot of harassment. The garrison troops are now carrying out pacification separately, and the measures are: (1) collecting scattered soldiers; (2) reporting firearms; (3) maintaining traffic; (4) restoring the preparation of local autonomy. After the Chen Brigade was stationed in Qiongya, there does not seem to be much problem in the southern region. However, Chen Jitang believes that the recovery of Chen Ce's naval force has not been completely resolved, so he has repeatedly sent personnel to Hong Kong to negotiate, and consulted with Chen Ce. As a result, the Hai Rui and Fu An warships were allowed to return to Guangzhou and rejoin the team, and arrived in Huangpu from Hong Kong on the evening of July 22nd. The Naval Commander Zhang Zhiying reported, and immediately sent six electric vessels to Huangpu the next day to welcome the commanders of the two ships to the province to report everything. Then Zhang Zhiying, accompanied by the two commanders, went to see Chen Jitang to discuss the retention of the officers and soldiers of the two ships and the payment of wages. After the matter was completed, Zhang returned to Huangpu to give a speech to the soldiers of the two ships. The two ships are still moored in Huangpu Port. It is found that the Central Government recently sent the Hai Rong warship to Hong Kong to discuss the return of the Guangdong warships to the north. Now that the two ships have returned to Guangdong, the Hai Rong warship seems to have lost its purpose. However, it is still concerned about the Feiying warship that was sunk in Haikou. It is said that the Hai Rong warship has been sailing to the sinking site of the Feiying during the day, hiring workers to salvage the Feiying, because the Feiying was only damaged by the steam furnace, and the entire hull is still intact. If it can be hoisted out of the water and slightly repaired, it can still be used. Even if it costs two or three hundred thousand yuan in project costs, it is quite worthwhile, because a new Feiying warship would cost more than three million yuan. In addition, the Central Navy warships Yongjian and Chutai No. 2, which continued to arrive in Hong Kong, have not yet left. As for the six inland river warships under Chen Ce, they recently fled into Hong Kong waters. Chen Jitang has sent diplomats to Hong Kong to negotiate the takeover, but there has been no effect yet. However, the Yingjie warship, which was stationed on the Dongdi river surface in the provincial capital, suddenly exploded for no reason on the evening of the 24th, and the entire ship was burned. The fire started in the ammunition and gunpowder depot, so when the fire broke out at about 11 o'clock that night, bullets flew everywhere, and the fire brigade did not dare to approach to put out the fire. After burning for about fifteen minutes, it sank into the water. It is estimated that seven people on the ship were injured, including the pilot Zhang Sheng, sailor Peng Hao, and Zhou Mu, whose injuries were the most serious. About twenty or thirty other soldiers escaped by swimming, and were fortunately spared. It is found that the Yingjie warship was purchased in the early years of the Republic of China. It is 60 feet long, has a displacement of five feet, and is the giant of the Guangdong inland river patrol ships. The contents of the weapons were quite complete, including 13 officers, about 30 soldiers and sailors, four mortars, two small steel guns, and three machine guns. These weapons have all been destroyed in the water.</p>
<p>The total loss of the ship is about 100,000 yuan. Afterwards, the captain Lai Zuliu went to the naval headquarters to report everything and requested punishment. The authorities feared there were other suspicions and ordered the naval commander to investigate secretly. After the Yingjie warship was burned in the provincial river, it was also reported at the same time that the Pingnan warship in Haikou, Qiongzhou, suddenly went to Dianbai Port on the morning of the 26th. The above two incidents are really strange events in the aftermath of the Navy. (July 28th)</p>

<p>Six Proposals by Commissioners from Both Provinces to Address the Immediate Issues</p>
<p>Yangzhou Communication: The dredging of the southern waterways in Shandong, which is related to the Huai River and the Grand Canal north of the Yangtze River, was previously discussed between Jiangsu and Shandong provincial governments. Commissioners were dispatched by the Huai River Conservancy Commission, the Jiangsu-Shandong Construction Bureau, and the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau north of the Yangtze River to a meeting in the provincial capital. Solutions have already been discussed. It is said that the Huai River Conservancy Commission will be requested to set a date for notifying various organizations to dispatch personnel for joint surveys to determine the progress. It is learned that Tsai Cheng, deputy engineer of the Huai River Conservancy Commission, Cao Ruizhi, technical officer of the Shandong Provincial Construction Bureau, Feng Dan, county construction guidance engineer of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Bureau, and Tan Nong, head of the engineering department of the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau north of the Yangtze River, jointly submitted proposals to the Jiangsu and Shandong authorities after the meeting, suggesting methods for managing the waterways. The document stated: "Considering the Shandong province's dredging of rivers and lakes in the southern waterway basin, the people of Jiangsu unanimously oppose it. It was decided that the Huai River Conservancy Commission, the Jiangsu-Shandong Construction Bureau, and the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau north of the Yangtze River would separately dispatch personnel to conduct thorough joint surveys and find appropriate solutions." After receiving orders separately, officials convened at the Huai River Conservancy Commission in Nanjing on July 20th. It was found that Shandong Province received only 3,000 tons of American wheat, which was used for limited dredging of the Sishui River. The current projects on the East and West Sishui Rivers are mainly focused on reinforcing old embankments and closing breaches. The diversion channels connecting the lakes of Nanwang, Zhaoyang, and Weishan have been completed. Restoring the original state of the Wenshui River Daicun Dam is also nearing completion. It is undeniable that the Grand Canal itself, as well as the Niutou and Zhaowang Rivers, have not yet been started due to insufficient American wheat. Therefore, it is temporarily difficult for large amounts of water from Shandong to flow into Jiangsu. However, Shandong Province is actively proceeding with the dredging of the Niutou and Zhaowang Rivers, the Wanfu and Zhushui Rivers (draining the western slope of Shandong), the opening of locks and dams on various rivers in eastern Shandong, and the construction of dikes along the lakes. Even if the Shandong provincial government does not take action, the people will certainly do it themselves. In the future, the water from the eastern and western slopes of Shandong, south of the Yellow River, will all converge into Weishan Lake. Jiangsu, being downstream, must take urgent measures, or else next year's flooding could be disastrous. After consultation, a mutually beneficial solution was agreed upon. In addition to the Jiangsu and Shandong provincial governments jointly submitting a request to the Huai River Conservancy Commission and the Executive Yuan, which will then forward it to the National Government, for the immediate allocation of funds to implement the Siyi waterway management plan to fundamentally eliminate the water disasters in Jiangsu and Shandong, the following temporary measures for Jiangsu Province are also proposed: (1) Repairing the Shuangzha gates at the lake outlet; (2) Filling the deep trenches dug along the banks of the Hanzhuang Canal; (3) Restoring Linjia Dam; (4) Jiangsu Province should also add lake embankment projects to its lake management. The section from Biangou to the Jiangsu-Shandong border at the lake outlet should be built by Jiangsu Province, while the section from Changjiakou to Xiazhen should be built by Shandong Province on behalf of Jiangsu. (5) The projects to be undertaken by Jiangsu Province must be completed no later than mid-June of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). (6) Until the projects to be undertaken by Jiangsu Province are completed, the downstream sections of the Zhaowang, Niutou, and Southern Grand Canal in Shandong Province must not be dredged, and at least one hundred zhang [approximately 333 meters] must be left. The first, second, and third items will be planned and implemented by Jiangsu Province itself with allocated funds. The fourth item will be implemented by the two provinces separately by conscripting labor. The fifth and sixth items must be strictly observed by both Jiangsu and Shandong Provinces. In the future, after the completion of the projects in both provinces, the water from Shandong can be fully stored in the lake and will not flow downstream. Before the implementation of the Siyi waterway management plan, even if the lake water level rises, it will be safe as long as the dikes are strong. In this way, the solution does not violate the Huai River Conservancy Commission's principles for waterway management, and both provinces can temporarily celebrate peace and tranquility. We have prepared a map of the Shandong Province survey of the terrain of the Zhaowang, Zhushui, and Wanfu Rivers for your inspection. If approved, we request that you send specialists for on-site surveys and designs to determine the suitability of the plans. We respectfully request your decision and implementation."</p>
<h3 id="e102">Frequent Warning Reports from the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: The flow in the upper reaches of the Yellow River has been changing rapidly in recent days. The Zhukou and Lishengtun dangerous sections are simultaneously under pressure. The details were given in a previous letter. The River Affairs Bureau has been receiving urgent telegrams from the upper reaches like snowflakes since yesterday morning. The water level continues to rise, and the flow is turbulent and fierce, eroding the embankments and levees. They are collapsing, and danger is emerging. Changes are happening rapidly. (Zhukou is also issuing warnings, with two zhang [approximately 6.7 meters] of the main embankment slope collapsing.) Lishengtun has few soldiers, which is not enough to handle the emergency. In addition to the local laborers helping with the work, the Linpu Public Security Bureau chief led police officers and conscripted 50 laborers to join the rescue efforts. The River Affairs Bureau, considering the urgency of the situation, urgently telegraphed the head of the upper reaches section, Chen Wenmo, to rush from Shilibu to Lishengtun to supervise the emergency protection efforts and approved the use of new materials. This morning, they received a telegram from Chen stating that the road from Shilibu to Lishengtun was filled with green gauze tents, the local area was not peaceful, and the car kept starting and stopping, so he switched to a small car to proceed, to prioritize the engineering work. The River Affairs Bureau sent a special telegram to commend him. As for the Luokou water gauge, the water level also rose by 2.1 cun [approximately 6.7 centimeters] today, which is equivalent to 6.3 shi chi [approximately 2.1 meters]. The water level is 29.74 meters, which is equivalent to 8 zhang, 9 chi, and 2.2 cun [approximately 29.7 meters]. (August 4th)</p>

<p>To Discuss a Comprehensive Plan for Domestic and International Matters</p>
<p>Scheduled to Be Held in Zhenjiang on August 13th</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Communication: The Jiangsu Department of Industry believes that the decline of the Chinese silk industry has reached an extreme point. Examining the reasons, one is due to the pressure from artificial silk, and the other is due to the dumping of silk prices. In the United States, the total silk sales last year were 558,395 bales, a decrease of only 9% compared to the previous year. Japan's exports last year were 550,903 bales, a decrease of only 5% compared to the previous year. However, the output of factory silk in China during the same period was only 14,678 bales, a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year. Furthermore, Japan's silk sales to Europe have seen a sudden increase, and this year they are even seizing the Chinese market at a low price of 300 taels, which will fundamentally eradicate our sericulture industry. Domestically, silk farmers, merchants, and silk factories are acting independently, with no coordination whatsoever. The danger is imminent. For the sake of self-preservation, Jiangsu Province should establish a comprehensive plan, both domestically and internationally, to deal with the situation. Therefore, it is specially scheduled to convene the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Design Committee meeting in Zhenjiang on the 13th of August to discuss everything. A letter has also been sent to each committee member, requesting that all proposals be sent to the department for compilation and printing before the 12th.</p>

<p>Prolonged Drought Leads to Increased Epidemics: Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been a long period of sunny weather with no rain, resulting in a dry climate and rampant epidemics. Farmers are particularly suffering from the exhaustion of irrigating farmland. The villagers are eagerly hoping for rain, even more so than for clouds. The city's epidemic hospital has seen a gradual increase in the number of people seeking treatment. It is heard that cases of true cholera have been discovered. The number of deaths from the epidemic in Tinglin is counted in the dozens daily. The district office has specially prepared anti-epidemic medicine and is distributing it to various villages for injection. At the same time, they are advising people to eat less melons, fruits, fish, and crabs. People are dispatched daily to make announcements. According to reports from villagers in various villages, the rice leaves are already wilting and they are all worried. If it does not rain again, not only will the epidemics increase, but the autumn harvest will also be hopeless.</p>

<p>Qidong Asks for Aid Due to Banditry: Recently, the situation in Qidong, where bandits from the sea have joined forces with communists to cause disturbances, is very tense. County Magistrate Fei of the county telegraphed Nantong for aid. County Magistrate Zhang believed that the provincial security regiment deployed to Nantong to suppress the bandits had not yet fully arrived, and the regiment commander, Zhu Mian, was still in Jiangyin. He urgently telegraphed Commander Zhu to quickly lead his troops across the river to suppress the bandits and pacify the area.</p>
<p>Criminals in an Incest Case Escorted to Suzhou: Yang Guangrong, the main offender in an incest case in Tongyi, and accomplices Cai Changyuan and Li Rentang, were all sentenced to death by the Nantong County Court. All three criminals refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the High Court. On the 4th, President Chen sent police to escort the three criminals to Suzhou.</p>
<p>Drought in Jiangbei: Although there was light rain in various counties of Tongxu and Hai in Jiangbei</p>
<p>on one day, the drought became more apparent due to the continuous dry winds and strong sun. Except for the areas along the river and various areas with gates along the river, which relied on the river tides for relief and were in relatively good condition, the areas most in dire straits were the areas where Tongru connected. From Juegang to Pujiapu, the soil surface was cracked, and the ditches were dry, with no water for irrigation. The rice was already wilting, and the cotton was also burnt. The amount of loss was even greater than last year's flood.</p>

<p>Horrifying Incest Case: In Caijiawan, located in the 10th district (Beixia) about half a li [approximately 250 meters] from Xicang, the Cai surname lives as a clan. A farmer named Cai A'er and his eldest son, Rengen, were</p>
<p>arguing because there had been no rain for a long time, and the fields were in great need of water. After 7:00 PM the previous night, they were installing a machine in the field to pump water when Rengen suddenly had an argument with his younger brother, Heshang. A'er rebuked him for bullying his younger brother. Rengen, being a cruel and unfilial person, hated his father for favoring his younger brother. He raised his fist and punched his father severely. A'er was old and weak and was struck in a vital area, immediately falling to the ground and dying. Afterwards, the neighbors mobilized public debt and rushed to inform the town mayor, Cai Hongjun, who reported it to Zhao Kun, the captain of the Second Detachment of the First Company of the county police team stationed at Maotangqiao. The police arrested the unfilial son, Cai Rengen, and sent him to the county. The village head, Ju Chunpei, reported the incident to the county court. Prosecutor Du brought officials to the village, verified that the deceased had indeed been beaten to death, and ordered the relatives to prepare a coffin. At the same time, the county government transferred the murderer, Cai Rengen, to the court, where he was shackled and imprisoned pending legal proceedings.</p>
<p>▲The 19th Route Army Arrests Communists: Shen Guanghan, the commander of the 60th Division of the 19th Route Army, was ordered to lead his troops to Fujian to suppress the communists. After two months, he suddenly arrested a communist bandit. According to his confession, there were accomplices hiding in Zhoushanbang, Wuxi. He immediately telegraphed Hua Pu, the director of the Wuxi Public Security Bureau, to send detectives to arrest a suspect named Xu Liansheng on the upper floor of Wang Yongchang's foreign iron shop on Guangqin Road the previous night and bring him to the bureau for investigation. According to his confession, the name given by Commander Shen did not match exactly. The suspect was placed under police supervision, and a photo of Xu Liansheng was taken and sent to Fujian for identification, pending further action.</p>

She picked three fragrant melons from a melon field beside the road to quench her thirst. The owner of the melon field, Mi Gengquan (nickname "Tuzi Gengquan"), saw her and beat her in the waist with a flat rod, causing Wang to die from her injuries. He abandoned her body in the river. Afterwards, the deceased's brother, Wang Guanshun, reported the incident to the county court, requesting justice. However, the body had been hastily placed in a coffin by the deceased's husband, Gu He'fu. Prosecutor Shen ordered that the coffin be transported to the city for exhumation at Huishan.</p>

<p>▲The Arrest of a Fraudulent Agent for a Detective Position: A man surnamed Hu, named Shen Yu, who lives in Cang Lane and once worked as a reporter stationed in Zhenjiang for a Shanghai tabloid, was previously driven out of the area for specializing in spreading rumors and swindling. Having no way to make a living, Hu went to Shanghai and disappeared for a long time. Recently, Hu secretly returned to Zhenjiang and was seized by a man named Yin Guangcai yesterday morning and taken to the Second Branch Bureau. According to Yin, six months ago, Hu claimed to be working for the Water Police Team and promised to help him obtain a detective position, demanding a fee of 240 yuan, of which 80 yuan had been paid. However, six months had passed, the matter was never completed, and Hu had disappeared. Today, they met on the road, so he seized him and brought him to the bureau for investigation. After a preliminary hearing by the branch chief, Hu admitted to promising Yin a job but claimed to have only taken 27 yuan for entertainment expenses, with the rest of the money being used by Yin himself for socializing. When asked about his profession, he claimed to be working for the Shanghai police force. Branch Chief Zhang believed that the case involved fraud and obtaining money and immediately prepared a document for transfer to the General Bureau, so that it could be transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>

Now, due to the drought and the river water drying up, the rice fields urgently need irrigation. Therefore, farmers in the Second District all appealed to the District Office, requesting relief to prevent the rice fields from withering. Afterwards, District Chief Zhang Shiyan submitted a request to Wang Shuxiang, the director of the dam management, to quickly open the Chelou Ear Gate to save the crops. Director Wang commissioned Engineer Chen to investigate. The day before yesterday, District Chief Zhang, along with Zhang Eryou, the secretary-general of the Wuche Township Farmers Association, and Zhang Zhenbang, a resident of the district, went to visit Director Chen and negotiated for an early opening. Director Chen approved the request. It is now heard that the gate was opened yesterday (the 11th).</p>

<p>▲The Liangzhe Salt Administration Will Be Abolished: Zhou Junyan, the Liangzhe Salt Transport Commissioner, who concurrently served as the director of the Zhejiang Provincial Finance Department, has held this position for six years. Now, the Central Salt Affairs Administration has been taken over by the Chief of the Audit Office, who also serves concurrently. Zhou received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance today, stating that in order to save expenses and unify authority, he was instructed to immediately close the Salt Transport Commissioner's Office and transfer all salt affairs administrative matters to Feng Ruliang, the Chief of the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Audit Branch Office in Hangzhou, who will serve concurrently. Zhou was originally scheduled to go to Shanghai today to negotiate a loan but was unable to do so due to this development. He is now instructing the three sections of the administration—General Affairs, Sales, and Audit—to begin closing the office. According to Zhou, the administration was originally only responsible for salt affairs administrative matters, while salt tax revenue was collected entirely by the Salt Audit Branch Office, so closing the office will be easy and can be completed within days. The approximately 100 employees of the administration and the salt affairs administration will be taken over by the Audit Branch Office, which will inevitably lead to a major reduction in personnel. Whether the dozen or so salt fields in various counties of the province will be merged into local salt affairs audit branches or weighing and distribution bureaus is another matter. However, according to what the reporter knows, the salt tax has long been used to repay foreign debts, so each audit office has a deputy chief, who is a foreigner, to supervise the salt affairs and finances. This time, the Audit Office will take over the administration's affairs, which is a preliminary step towards implementing the merger.</p>

<p>General Assembly Passed Various Resolutions Yesterday</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th: The Ministry of Education Chemistry Conference opened its general assembly at 8:00 AM on the 5th, with 40 members attending and Chen Kezhong presiding. The chairmen of each sub-group reported on the resolutions of their respective groups. First, the Curriculum Standards and Translation Group presented its report on the review of curriculum standards for junior high school, senior high school, and university. After discussion and amendment, it was passed. In addition, an additional report on six curriculum standards proposals and a translation review proposal and its attachments were discussed and passed. Next, the National Defense Chemistry Group reported on the group's resolutions, which were amended and passed. Among them, regarding researchers, there were proposals to request the Ministry of Education to establish a national defense professorship and to request all universities and academic institutions to establish national defense chemistry professorships and national defense chemistry research laboratories within their capabilities. Regarding education and propaganda, there were proposals to request the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to compile and translate national defense chemistry books for widespread dissemination and to request the Ministry of Education to broadly disseminate national defense chemistry knowledge to the public. There were three proposals regarding organizational industries, etc. Regarding other matters, there were proposals to request the government to exempt agricultural and industrial salt and domestically produced industrial alcohol from taxes and to abolish the monopoly on saltpeter and sulfur. The chairman proposed that the graduates of the Chemical Engineering Department of National Central University requested assistance from the conference to restore the Chemical Engineering Department of the school. All members said that they personally expressed sympathy, but the general assembly was inconvenient to discuss. Subsequently, the representatives of the General Staff explained that the department welcomed</p>
<p>the members of the conference to come for discussions. The members unanimously agreed. Afterwards, members such as Wang Jiliang proposed to request the Ministry of Education to convey to the government on behalf of the members attending this chemistry conference their willingness to participate in national defense chemistry work to fulfill their national responsibilities. The meeting passed the resolution and immediately elected Huang Xinyan, Chen Yuguang, Zeng Zhaolun, Hu Ankai, and Ding Sixian as representatives to go to various government agencies after the meeting on the 6th to present their opinions and discuss the various proposals, hoping that they would be adopted and implemented. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM.</p>

<p>▲Prescribing Objectives for Civic Training and Self-Study Hours for All High Schools</p>
<p>Conference Concludes, Curriculum Standards to Be Consolidated and Submitted to the Ministry of Education for Promulgation</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th: The primary and secondary school curriculum conference, the primary school group's general assembly started at 8:00 AM on the 5th, and the secondary school group's afternoon general assembly started and adjourned at 8:00 PM. The two groups' meetings concluded simultaneously, and all members left Nanjing in different directions that evening. It was resolved that the curriculum standards would be handed over to the standing committee for consolidation and then submitted to the Ministry of Education for promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e114">(1) Primary School Group <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Primary School Group Resolved:</p>
<p>(1) Operational Requirements for Civic Training are divided into four categories: morality, recreation, politics, and economics.</p>
<p>(2) The General Outline of the Primary School Curriculum is to be arranged by the standing committee. (3) The Overall Objectives of Primary School Education remain in accordance with the original proposal. (4) A table should be included in the general outline, implementation standards, and implementation measures to indicate the textbook issues for each subject.</p>
<p>(5) The positions of the teaching principles and implementation measures in the general outline should be reversed. (6) The objectives of civic training are prescribed as follows: A. To cultivate children's noble character and good behavior; B. To cultivate children's ability to organize groups and the spirit of social service; C. To cultivate children's strong physique and happy emotions; D. To develop children's labor habits and interest in production. (7) The Civic Training Law: The group will formulate the main points of the civic training law and submit them to the standing committee for compilation.</p>
<p>(8) Detailed Items for Civic Training Operations: The standing committee will classify the existing materials and</p>
<p>create annual tables, send them to the committee members, set a deadline for reporting opinions, and then make a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e115">(II) Secondary School Group <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Secondary School Group Decisions</p>
<p>(I) Total weekly self-study hours at school for each grade in junior high school: 13 hours for the first, second, third, and fifth semesters, and 14 hours for the fourth and sixth semesters. The following regulations are also stipulated: 1. Junior high school students' total daily class and self-study time is set at eight hours, calculated as 48 hours per week, excluding class time; the remaining time is for self-study at school. 2. Teachers must supervise and guide self-study time at school. 3. All students, whether boarding or day students, must participate in self-study at school. 4. Extracurricular sports and activities for students are not included in the self-study time at school. 5. The time for self-study at school and extracurricular sports activities may be slightly adjusted and flexibly arranged according to the season, day student/boarding student status, and other factors.</p>
<p>(II) Total weekly extracurricular activities and self-study hours for senior high school: 27 hours for the first, second, third, and fourth semesters, and 30 hours for the fifth and sixth semesters. The following regulations are also stipulated: 1. Senior high school students' total daily class, self-study, and extracurricular sports time is set at ten hours, calculated as 60 hours per week. 2. In addition to class time, one hour per day is designated for extracurricular sports, with the remaining time for self-study. 3. Teachers must supervise and guide both extracurricular sports and self-study time.</p>
<p>(III) Junior high school Chinese language will follow the original proposal, using both classical and vernacular Chinese.</p>
<p>(IV) For drawing, Xu Beihong advocated "teaching to the best of one's ability." As a result, "teaching to the best of one's ability" was implemented before teaching geometry in junior high school, and only pattern design and instrument use were taught in senior high school. (V) Except for courses such as Civics, Mineralogy, Agriculture, and Home Economics, which require separate drafting, all other course curricula have been revised and approved.</p>
<p>(VI) A member proposed during the meeting that since teachers are responsible for guiding self-study, self-study time should be compensated at the same rate as class time. As a result, the Ministry of Education stated that hourly pay in secondary schools could easily lead to abuse. The Ministry of Education is currently drafting salary guidelines for secondary school teachers.</p>
<p>▲ Experts Express Opinions on Secondary School Curriculum</p>
<p>Education experts from both primary and secondary school groups stated that the members of the secondary school group were able to uphold their positions, striving for the number of hours allocated to each subject and advocating for specialization in senior high school, which is commendable. However, curriculum development is a specialized field. It is best for experts from research departments to draft the curriculum, then gather opinions from experts in each subject before finalizing it, which would be more rational and avoid conflicts over each subject "sweeping snow from its own doorstep." Now that senior high school is divided into general, vocational, and teacher training tracks, the question arises whether the junior high school curriculum and hours decided upon this time have the function of exploring students' interests in employment, or are they only considering general track students who will continue their education? This is a question worthy of further study. Furthermore, the style of the secondary school curriculum standards generally uses classical Chinese, while textbooks for each subject, except for Chinese language, generally use vernacular Chinese, creating inconsistency.</p>
<p>It is indeed necessary to further discuss this matter, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Teaching Hour Table for Each Semester of Junior and Senior High School</p>
<p>The Secondary School Group of the Primary and Secondary School Curriculum Standards Revision Conference, after three days of intense discussion, revised and approved one teaching hour table for each semester of junior and senior high school, and one elective course classification table for the three years of senior high school. These three tables are of great importance to the overall curriculum planning of secondary schools. They are reproduced below:</p>
<p>(I) Teaching Hour Table for Each Subject in Each Semester of Junior High School</p>

<p>Senior high school generally does not separate into different tracks. However, in schools with a large number of classes, in the third year, 4 hours of Civics, 2 hours of Chinese, 2 hours of Logic, and 2 hours of Music (a total of 10 hours) can be reduced. The remaining hours will be used to teach a selected number of subjects from the following two categories in groups. Students who select subjects from the first category cannot select subjects from the second category, and vice versa.</p>
<p>▲First Category of Elective Subjects: Chinese, English, Sociology, Logic, Psychology.</p>
<p>▲Second Category of Elective Subjects: Mathematics, Biology, Plant Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Drawing, Physical Education</p>
<h3 id="e116">Shen Silian Reports on His Trip <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲ Rumors of Manchukuo's Participation in the World Games Are Completely False</p>
<p>▲ The Organizing Committee Has Earnestly Assured Consul General Huang</p>
<p>▲ The Dispatch of Our Country's Athletes Has Attracted Great Attention from Americans</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Silian, the representative of the International Olympic Committee member Wang Rutang and Fu Shizhi, wrote from Berkeley, California, on July 14th: Every time the ship I was on arrived at a port, news reporters often prepared small boats to greet us, especially in Japan and San Francisco, indicating that China's first participation in the World Games this time has attracted great attention. I heard many things about our country sending two athletes. Japanese newspapers were quite concerned about this, but their comments were mostly negative. In San Francisco, I met American and Chinese news reporters. When the ship arrived or the next day, newspapers published news about China's participation in this World Games. The overseas Chinese were particularly concerned about various news and Liu Changchun's actual participation. Liu's attendance will bring praise and respect from many people in China. I dare to say that.</p>
<p>After arriving here, I immediately visited Dr. Huang Yunsu, the Consul General of China. In his office, I saw the letters he exchanged with the organizing committee regarding the rumor that the organizing committee had recognized Manchukuo's participation in the Games. Based on the correspondence, the committee did not do this and never officially allowed them to participate in the Summer Olympics Committee. The committee assured Consul General Huang that all rumors were groundless. Although Shanghai's Western newspapers reported that the Chinese government had ordered Consul General Huang to represent China at the official opening ceremony of the Games, Dr. Huang Zhisu told me today that he had not received such an appointment. I hope he will eventually receive instructions from the central government, as I very much hope he can accompany me to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The grand ceremony at the end of the month has been prepared. President Hoover will officiate the official opening ceremony. Governor Roosevelt of New York is also expected to attend. Hundreds of foreign athletes have already arrived in Los Angeles for their final training. Newspapers everywhere have special reports on the Summer Olympics. Tickets for various events can be purchased in various cities in the United States. Signs selling tickets are everywhere. The whole country knows about this grand event.</p>
<p>The United States is confident in track and field. This Saturday and Sunday, American athletes will hold national trials in California. Many world records have been eclipsed. There are many talented American runners.</p>
<p>The United States also hopes to win in swimming, but Japan is competing fiercely and may take second place. Japan's swimming team has great hope and believes they can secure the swimming title. It is too early to predict other sports. The registration deadline for all events is July 16. On the 12th, I registered Liu Changchun for the 100-meter, 200-meter, and 400-meter races. Although we don't have high hopes, this is a start, and hopefully a good one.</p>

<p>New World Records Abound</p>
<p>▲ Javelin, Triple Jump, Women's 80-Meter Hurdles All Set World Records</p>
<p>The appearance of new world records is commonplace, as reporters have repeatedly stated. On the sixth day of the Games (i.e., the fifth day of track and field competitions), three more world records were set: (1) Finnish athlete Järvinen's javelin throw of 72.74 meters; (2) Japan's Nan's triple jump of 15.72 meters; (3) After American Didrikson set a world record of 143 feet 4 inches (43.688 meters) in the women's javelin throw, she set a new world record of 11.7 seconds in the women's 80-meter hurdles, shortening her previous time of 11.8 seconds in the preliminary round by another second. Setting world records is as easy as turning one's hand! The new records of the Olympic Games will be regarded as worthless, without any value. Reporters can only be speechless about this.</p>

<p>▲ Achieves 15.72 Meters</p>
<p>A New World Record</p>
<p>▲ Oda Cries Due to Elimination</p>
<p>Los Angeles, April 4th (Reuters): Japan today won its first track and field event. After winning the triple jump, Chūhei Nanbu won the triple jump championship, breaking the record of 49 feet 10 and 13/16 inches set by Mikio Oda at the 9th Games in 1928, with a record of 51 feet 6 and 3/4 inches, setting a new world record. Los Angeles, April 4th (Telecommunications): The results of today's triple jump final are as follows: First: Chūhei Nanbu (Japan) 15.72 meters, Second: Svensson (Sweden) 15.32 meters, Third: Kenkichi Oshima (Japan) 15.12 meters, Fourth: FitzClarence (Ireland), Fifth: Badhas (Netherlands), Sixth: Solvas (USA). Nanbu's record of 15.72 meters is a new world record, not only breaking the Olympic record of 15.525 meters held by Viarda, but also breaking Oda's world record of 15.58 meters.</p>
<p>▲Oda Cries Due to Elimination. International hurdles star Mikio Oda, although competing despite illness, only jumped 14 and a half meters on his first and second attempts. Although he jumped on the third attempt, the pain was too great, and he could not jump again, leading to his elimination. At that time, tears of sadness welled up in his cheeks. When he saw Nanbu win first place, he rushed to Nanbu to express his deep gratitude and embraced each other to show their closeness. At this time, the Japanese flag was hoisted on the central flagpole, the national anthem was played, and the Japanese expatriates cheered and applauded non-stop. Then Oda and Nanbu, amidst great cheers, went hand in hand to the athletes' changing room.</p>
<p>▲The Finals: Los Angeles, April 4th (Telecommunications): At the beginning of the triple jump, Wass (USA) jumped 14.852 meters on his first attempt, Romero (USA) jumped 14.820 meters, and Ohman (USA) jumped 14.744 meters. At that time, Nanbu (Japan) had already jumped 15.074 meters, taking the lead. Oda jumped 14 and a half meters, and Oshima fouled. On the second attempt, Oda's leg pain flared up again, and he stopped at 14 and a half meters. Although Oshima jumped over 15 meters, he also fouled. Nanbu jumped 15.220 meters, and Svensson (Sweden) jumped 15.32 meters. On the third attempt, Oda made a final effort, with a tragic expression, after taking a deep breath, he only hobbled to the boundary line, unable to jump again due to the unbearable pain in his foot. The third attempt was then terminated. Fortunately, Nanbu and Oshima won first and third place respectively, comforting Nanbu's heart.</p>
<p>Chūhei Nanbu (Japan), who set a new world record in the triple jump, with a score of 15.72 meters.</p>

J. Järvinen of Finland, and third place went to J. Doherty of the United States. In this Games, the Finnish army still has hopes of winning the championship. More than ten people have already registered, for events, including 100 meters, long jump, shot put, high jump, and 400 meters. The remaining five events will be held later (i.e., on the 6th and 7th). The rowing competition, which will begin at the Los Angeles wharf, is also a new competition. At the 9th Amsterdam Games, Norway was first, Sweden second, Denmark third, the Netherlands fourth, Czechoslovakia fifth, and Finland sixth. All Nordic countries have been selected for this Games. It is feared that the United Kingdom and the United States have no hope of winning the championship, and it will still belong to one of the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>In the modern pentathlon, the 5th will be for swimming. The athletes who participated in the equestrian and shooting events will now be in the water.</p>

<p>▲ A Scene from Balotera vs. Allison</p>
<p>▲ Alleged Referee Error, but Still Proven Fair</p>
<p>In this year's Davis Cup tennis tournament, France and the United States competed in Paris. The focus of the outcome between the two countries was really Balotera's victory over Allison. When the two men were playing, some people thought that the service line judge mistakenly called Balotera's second serve a good ball, which prevented Allison from completing the last point of his winning set. The Davis Cup championship also shifted because of this. Although Mr. Giro, President of the French Tennis Association, understood that the umpire on the court had irrefutable power, he still announced the letters from the service line judge and the linesman to show impartiality. In the judge's letter, he said that Mr. Ba's second serve was right on the line and was considered valid. There were many difficult problems on the court, but this one was the easiest to solve. He had served as a Davis Cup referee for five years and had never made any mistakes. In the linesman's letter, he said that in his personal opinion, Mr. Ba's serve landed right on the line, without any objection, so he considered the judge's decision to be completely correct.</p>

<h3 id="e130">China's First Map <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Han Ji</p>
<p>When Haishenwai [Vladivostok] was taken by the Russians, no one knew where Haishenwai was, and even maps were hard to find. Speaking of maps, one must recall the historical records of the mapmaking during the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, which is also found in the study of the spread of Catholicism in China. (In the 47th year of Kangxi's reign, priests were ordered to go to various parts of Mongolia and provinces of China to survey mountains, rivers, cities, and walls, and to draw maps using Western triangulation methods. Officials were also selected and dispatched to assist, and orders were sent to governors-general and governors to instruct local officials under their jurisdiction to provide all necessary supplies.) ········</p>
<p>[From the 47th year of Kangxi, more than ten priests, including Bai Jin [Joachim Bouvet], Lei Xiaosi [Jean-Baptiste Régis], Du Demei [Pierre Jartoux], Pan Ru [Matteo Ripa], and Demano [Xavier Ehrenbert Fridelli], went to various provinces to draw maps. They started from outside the passes, then extended to the interior provinces, and it took nine years for the map to be completed. It was named "Complete Map of the Imperial Territory." In addition to the general map, there were also provincial maps. Bai Jin and others presented them to the Emperor for review, and they were greatly praised by the Emperor.] ········ [In the 58th year of Kangxi, the Emperor held the map and said to the Grand Secretary of the Inner Cabinet, Jiang Tingxi:] ·· [This map took me more than thirty years of effort to complete. The mountains and rivers are all consistent with the Yu Gong [Tribute of Yu]. You can show this map to the Nine Ministers for their examination.]</p>
<p>The Nine Ministers requested to be granted a copy, and the Emperor approved. Thus, the map drawn by the priests was widely circulated, covering the entire country. This was truly the beginning of maps in China. The maps drawn by Matteo Ricci in the past had many omissions, and the maps drawn by the Chinese were disorganized and full of errors, not worth a scholar's laugh. To this day, Chinese and foreign people who draw maps of China generally use the Kangxi map as a blueprint.]</p>
<p>Emperor Kangxi took this first map of China very seriously, just as Napoleon viewed the Civil Code. Originally, Napoleon, in exile on Saint Helena, on the eve of his death, said to his loyal general Montholon ·· [In my life, I have won hundreds of battles, but the Battle of Waterloo completely ruined my achievements, reducing them to nothing. Only this Civil Code is my sole success.]</p>
<p>Emperor Kangxi loved that map so much that he specially ordered someone to make a white jade eight-immortal table. On the surface of the white jade table, a map inlaid with gold was carved with extremely fine craftsmanship. This is a story not recorded in historical records. During the Anglo-French Allied Forces invasion, the British transported this white jade eight-immortal table to Shanghai. I personally saw this map inlaid with gold and white jade. Later, I heard that the white jade eight-immortal table somehow sank into the Mediterranean Sea and never made it to England.</p>

<p>The Snake Temple on Penang Island Penang Island, also known as Pinang, is one of the three states of the British Straits Settlements. It is the garden of the Nanyang Islands. On the island, there is an area called "Shen Qi Ke Long" [Sungai Keluang]. The famous Snake Temple is located there. In the temple, snakes gather in groups of three or five, coiling around shrubs or winding on stone steps. They do not bite or run away when they see people. They raise their heads and stick out their tongues, appearing content and at ease. The snakes are mostly yellow, and there are approximately several hundred of them. No one knows the exact number. The snakes are extremely tame and never harm people. Even if someone touches or strokes them, they do not react in any way. The snakes have a habit of eating chicken eggs. If a guest buys eggs to eat, they nod their heads to express their gratitude to the guest. The snakes use their sharp teeth to break a hole in the end of the egg and suck out all the yolk and white. They eat quickly without breaking the egg. The locals believe that the temple has many snakes that are harmless to people because it is blessed by a deity. Therefore, the incense in this temple is very prosperous. Every year, the sixth day of the first lunar month is a major day for the local people to worship at the temple (meaning it is a festival). Worshippers enter and exit the Snake Temple in an endless stream, expressing their superstition to the fullest. New visitors to Nanyang, hearing that the snakes in the temple, although venomous, are not poisonous, often go to the temple to pay their respects. Therefore, the person guarding the temple takes the opportunity to sell incense, candles, paper ingots, and chicken eggs, and their income is said to be quite good.</p>
<p>▲ The Singapore Botanic Gardens The Singapore Botanic Gardens is located on Holland Road in the Bukit Timah district. It covers an area of approximately 350 acres. The garden is densely covered with trees and grass, and there are ponds, offices, libraries, and experiment rooms. The buildings are exquisitely built and fully equipped. The garden was founded in 1874. The rubber trees of Nanyang are the result of experiments in the aforementioned experiment rooms. The garden is also famous for this. After entering the garden gate, proceed along the asphalt road. On the left, you can see tropical plants such as the sago palm and the coconut palm. On the right, the terrain is undulating, and the green lawn fills the eyes. The high ground of the hill is like a platform. High trees that reach the sky are planted all around. Walking here on a moonlit night is like being in another world, no longer in the human realm. Turning from the foot of the hill, you will encounter a pond. In the pond, there is a patch of grass more than ten feet square, on which mango trees are planted. Legend has it that the Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang was the first to introduce mangoes to China. Whether he brought them back to China from here is unknown. On the shore of the pond, there is a durian tree, which is very strange in appearance. Proceeding from the pond, there is a slope. On the side of the road, there is a bodhi tree with leaves shaped like purses, as well as betel nut trees and sorrowless trees. In Sanskrit, the sorrowless tree is called Ashoka, and Indians revere it like a god. Going further to the right, you can enter the office. Turning left will return you to the asphalt road. Proceeding to the right of the crossroads, there is a shade house. Going west from here, you can reach Coconut Valley. There are many varieties of coconuts here, dazzling the eyes. There are so-called ivory coconuts, sugar coconuts, big-leaf coconuts, wax-flying coconuts, fan-leaf coconuts, king coconuts, and shell-leaf coconuts, etc. Passing Coconut Valley, you can exit the garden. This garden is rich in tropical plants. Anyone who studies plants will be delighted to see it. Behind the garden gate, in the woods, there are many monkeys crouching on the road, not afraid of people. They even kowtow to beg for things. If you try to catch them, they will run away. They move as fast as lightning and disappear in an instant.</p>
<h3 id="e132">The Riddle of Hollywood <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Lao Ren</p>
<p>Who knows, Locke is the comedian of Hollywood. Every movie fan has in their minds all sorts of humorous actions of this gentleman. Recently, a lawsuit between a real and fake Locke suddenly occurred in Los Angeles. What exactly is the truth in the gourd? This riddle has yet to be broken. As for Huang Amei, I'm afraid more people know her, because she is China's only star overseas. Last month, she was entangled by a strange old lady who insisted on being her mother. It's really funny.</p>
<p>▲ Lawsuit between real and fake Lockes The lawsuit between the real and fake Lockes has been going on for several years. The New York court has been trying this case for a long time but has not been able to resolve it. Both sides insist on their own versions of events, and the argument is getting fiercer. The plaintiff insists that the Locke who is currently making movies is fake and should be charged with impersonation. He petitioned the authorities, saying, "I, Burchard, was born in Nebraska as Harold Lloyd. The imposter movie star must be prohibited from using the name Harold Lloyd." At the time, the authorities ruled in favor of the defendant because the plaintiff did not have sufficient evidence. Unexpectedly, last month, the plaintiff's case was revived and he filed a second lawsuit with the court. Locke has already spent thousands of dollars dealing with him. There are currently no results. However, the Locke production company is extremely busy answering letters from all over the world asking about the lawsuit every day. The strangest thing is that Locke received a forged letter saying, "Your feet are worth twelve million dollars. Please send down some." From this, we can infer the key to this impersonation lawsuit.</p>
<p>▲ Huang Amei's Mother The Chinese female star Huang Amei has had a considerable history in Hollywood. She lives on Figueroa Street. In addition to her parents, there is also a younger sister named Mary in the family. One day, Amei received a letter with the following content: "Amei, please come to 908 North Country Street. Mother." Amei was extremely surprised. She immediately consulted with her lawyer. To avoid the danger of kidnapping, she reported it to the police, who sent three detectives to accompany her. When they arrived at the location specified in the letter, they saw an elderly woman who grasped Amei's hand and said incessantly, "Ten years ago, I had a beloved daughter who suddenly disappeared from China. I searched for her without success. By chance, I saw your beautiful face on the screen, and it resembled my beloved daughter. That's why I came from thousands of miles away to meet you." Although Amei listened to her words, comforted her, and left. On the third day, the beautiful tale of the Chinese old woman searching for her daughter thousands of miles away was spread throughout Hollywood.</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Zhong, a native of Suzhou, has been engaged in the writing profession for many years. He has connections with people in the literary and art circles in Shanghai. Recently, he has collaborated with the martial arts star Zheng Chaofan to create a literary and art tri-weekly publication called "Ji Bao." He has already obtained several long novels by contemporary celebrities and hired Mr. Wang Huaibing from Suzhou as the editor. The content is divided into two categories: current affairs and movies. The selection of articles is strict, and the materials are new and unique. It will create a new style in small newspapers. It is said that it will be published soon.</p>

<p>(29) Glassware Factory</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen manufacturers of glassware in Shanghai. The larger ones include Zhonghua Fengji, Pudong No. 1 Factory, Gongyi Renhe, Qianyi Bingtai, Shanghai Xiechang, Sanyi, and Jiangji. The Xin'ya Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory also produces glass bottles and watch glasses. These types of bottles for holding liquid medicines must be made of hard glass, otherwise the medicine will undergo a chemical reaction and the bottle will break. In our country, only Xin'ya produces hard glass bottles and watch glasses. The rest mainly produce lampshades.</p>
<p>The raw material for making lampshades is glass sand, which is produced in Suqian, Jiangsu, and Lufeng, Guangdong. Analyzing it, its components are approximately manganese feldspar, stone powder, sulfurized charcoal, sodium sulfate, sand, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, lead carbonate, alkali, etc. However, manufacturers in Shanghai mostly buy broken glass pieces and remelt them to make lampshades, taking advantage of the convenience and low price. However, if you want to make hard glass, you must add raw materials.</p>
<p>A furnace is required to melt the materials. The furnace is made of pot ash and wood. The fuel is charcoal or bituminous coal. After four or five hours of burning, the material in the pot melts into a liquid. Workers gather around the furnace and dip the end of a glass tube into the pot. After a little liquid adheres, they take it out. Seeing the liquid forming a ball at the end of the tube, they blow it into a bubble shape and then put it into a mold. They blow it again, and the lampshade is formed. The molds are all made of iron. One mold forms two or three lampshades. After pouring them out, they are opened with a lathe and polished with a grinding wheel. Then they are placed in a baking oven for another baking. Then this shade is durable and can be sold. Prices vary widely, and sales are better in the interior. However, when manufacturing lampshades, although there are molds, the technique of mouth-blowing and hand-turning must be skillful. It is impossible without highly skilled workers. The wages are about 50 or 60 yuan per person per month.</p>
<p>The Japanese have established Bao Cheng in Shanghai, in Gujiawan, and San Gong, on Wuzhou Road. The Baoshan Glass Factory on Yokohama Road is a Sino-Japanese joint venture with a capital of 300,000 to 500,000 yuan. It is the largest glass factory in Shanghai.</p>

<p>— Bu Chu Ting Cao Zhai Tian</p>

<p>I said: "Changes in individual attitudes are certainly possible, but relying solely on individual efforts to promote the work-study corps is unreliable and slow. China has now reached a critical juncture of life and death. The times will not allow us to leisurely shed this traditional snake skin. I am impatient to wait for the natural spread of this work-study corps. I am eager to hear you talk about that compulsory dissemination."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said: "Compulsory dissemination is inevitable dissemination. The inevitable dissemination of the work-study corps comes from two paths. (1) The general phenomenon in the country now is that the number of school-age children who want to enter elementary school but cannot exceeds the capacity of new elementary schools by several times; the number of elementary school graduates who want to enter middle school but cannot exceeds the capacity of new middle schools by several times; the number of middle school graduates who want to enter university but cannot exceeds the capacity of new universities by several times. New universities, new middle schools, and new elementary schools are unable to add more places, so where do the majority of students who cannot pass the entrance exams to universities, middle schools, and elementary schools go? Their thirst for knowledge has been awakened, and the facts will not allow them to enter purely academic schools. This work-study corps is just right for their needs. (2) Traditional universities, elementary schools, and middle schools only consume and do not produce. The people they cultivate are also naturally those who can only consume and cannot produce. No one wants people who can only consume and cannot produce. Nankai University once had a discussion about 'rotating education.' The so-called 'rotating education' meant that teachers taught students, and students became teachers in rotation, all circling within the walls of the school. Now, even this rotating circle is unreliable. It is already difficult for university graduates to become elementary school teachers, and middle school graduates are even less likely to do so. When there is a vacancy for an elementary school teacher, there are sometimes dozens of candidates. This clearly shows us that traditional schools have reached the end of their rope. If useful things are overproduced, they still cannot be sold, let alone waste! Traditional schools originally produced useless people, which were difficult to sell. Fortunately, there were positions for teachers in lower-level schools, allowing them to dump their products. Now that even this dumping route has been blocked, can we still produce useless people? These facts are bound to come, inevitably forcing the entire nation to awaken, and inevitably forcing the entire nation to find another way of life and not allowing them to hesitate for even a moment at this crossroads. At this critical juncture of life and death, the entire nation may issue a general mobilization order, requiring everyone to live a work-study corps life together, in which case turning danger into safety will be as easy as turning one's hand."</p>
<h3 id="e136">Anecdotes from the Examination Hall <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yu Sheng</p>
<p>There were two pedantic brothers in the county. The elder brother lived in the south of the city, and the younger brother lived in the north of the county. They were both old scholars from elementary schools. Last autumn, they went to Nanjing together to take the examination for certification. The first exam was arithmetic. The examiner ordered them to answer the question: "Today there are 112 taels of meat. How many catties [jin] is that?" The brothers, who were sitting next to each other, could not decide on the answer and began to argue. Soon the argument became more intense. They even forgot themselves, and the noise startled everyone. They almost started a fistfight. The examiner was angry and stopped them. He asked them what the matter was. The elder brother stepped forward and said, "The city scale is slightly less than 15 taels per catty, and the county scale is slightly more than 16 taels per catty. I don't know if this 112 taels of meat should be measured with the city scale or the county scale. It's a matter of 'a few taels of meat,' [which] 'must not be brushed aside.' That's why we argued." The examiner fell over laughing and ordered them to leave and dismissed them.</p>
<p>The decline of national studies has reached its extreme today. When a certain university in Beiping came to Shanghai to recruit students this time, in order to promote national studies, all applicants to the Faculty of Arts, in addition to the particularly obscure classical Chinese exam questions, were asked to answer a name for "Sun Wukong." [The Monkey King] Applicants were caught off guard and were all forced to put down their pens and politely decline. An older student heard this and said, "What's so difficult about that? 'Hu Shi' is an acceptable answer." As the saying goes, "Those who can do it find it easy, those who cannot do it find it difficult." That's what it means.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Financial Bullion Experiences Sharp Drop <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>▲ Down by Seven Taels Yesterday, there was a sudden slump in the bullion market, with dealers showing signs of weakening and prices fluctuating. Overall, there was a difference of more than eight taels throughout the day, followed by a sharp drop of seven taels, a dramatic change unseen for many days. Supply exceeded demand from all sides, and initially the market was relatively stable, with no movement in the silver market, but the exchange rate suddenly plummeted. As a result, both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates loosened, causing this sudden change in the market. There were occasional fluctuations of two taels, but the 740 tael mark was eventually broken. The market became increasingly sluggish, with both the British and American exchange rates becoming unusually loose, and the market almost collapsed. Prices continued to fall by four to five taels, and finally ended at around thirty-six taels. Rumor has it that a certain bank purchased more than 300 bars of spot bullion at a price of around 742 taels. The daily situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Opening Price Increased by Three Cents The market opened relatively flat in the early morning, up slightly by three cents, at 743 taels and 8 cents. Although the silver price and other factors did not show any gains or losses, the sudden drop in the exchange rate by 2.375 points allowed the gold price to be maintained. The next price was 44 taels, with Yifeng Yongwu and others buying in. Subsequently, Hengxing, Yuanyuanmao, Yongzhi, Fengyong, and others came to sell, and the exchange rate was initially flat, with British gold at half a penny for August settlement and Shanghai for October at 6.6875. The US dollar was selling at 30 yuan for the near term, and the gold price retreated by more than one tael. At 9:30, it was 42.5 taels. HSBC listed the British and American exchange rates each rising by 2.5 points, but there was no impact. Hengxing came in to buy at 43 taels. The internal plate for the US dollar in September was 30 yuan and 6.25 cents for both purchases and sales. Before long, Wu Pin, Setou [a type of trading], and Hengxing, Yuanchong, Kangyong, Yuanyuan, Dayong, and others dumped their holdings, and the price dropped by more than two taels. At nearly 10 o'clock, it was 40 taels and 9 cents. Later, because a certain bank bought cash bullion, and Yifeng Yong, Yingfeng Heng, Shunli Hengxing, Yuan Zhifeng Yong, Hengxing, and others bought in relentlessly, the price increased by a tael or so. However, from 10 to 11 o'clock, there was a slight fluctuation of one tael or so, while Wu Pin sold. Then, at 11:20, it was 42 taels and 6 cents, and afterwards around 42 taels, but the selling momentum was strong, including Hengchang Yongheng, Yu Dadecheng Yong, Fengyuan Maoyong Hengxing, Yuan Zhaofeng Chang, Yifeng Yong, etc. Also, because the US dollar was pushed hard by the British gold, 4.375 was available for November settlement, so the gold price fell again by two or three taels, and eventually broke through 40 taels. At noon, it was 39 taels, and by the closing, after 39 taels and 4 cents, it went to 9 cents.</p>
<p>▲ Sharp Drop in the Afternoon The market opened in the afternoon down by a little more than one tael, at 37 taels and 8 cents, due to the remaining trend after the noon closing. Moreover, Shunli and others sold off after posting their prices, and Chengfeng Yong and others sold very strongly, and the price was reduced to 37.5 taels. The September British gold at 75 and the August US dollar at 30 yuan and 6.25 cents were all transactions between banks. Later, Hengxing took the stage to buy in, and at 2:40, it was 7 taels and 4 cents. The Wheat Exchange absorbed the November US dollar at 5625, and after the price was entered at 125 for this month, Yuan Maoyong, Tongchun, Fuyu, Zhaofeng Chang, Yuan Xingyong, and others followed up by selling, and it was suppressed by two or three cents. The British gold was particularly strong, and the US dollar was dragged down and discounted. For August, it had to be sold at 1875. People were anxious, and at 3 o'clock, it was 35 taels and 6 cents. Later, it increased slightly by two taels because Hengxing Yifeng Yong and Qian Changxiang bought in, and Setou also bought. At 3:10, it was 7 taels and 6 cents. Due to the complicated situation, although trading on the table was active, there was not much volume. At 3:30, it was 6 taels and a half, and then 7 taels and 1 cent, but Yuan Xingyong continued to sell, and it dropped to 6 taels and 2 cents. Hengxing Tong Taichang suddenly came in and pulled it up by 5 cents, to 6 taels and 7 cents. By the 4 o'clock closing, it was 36 and a half taels, a sharp drop of 7 taels compared to the previous day, and retail investors were still selling, so it was reduced by another four or five cents (the closing price for Wu Pin was 6 taels). According to the day's maximum price of 44 taels and the minimum price of 35 taels and 6 cents (the new low price since the market opened in September), the total fluctuation was 8 taels and 4 cents. In retrospect, the red bar count was up by 8.5 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Posted Prices Did Not Fluctuate Much The posted price was changed to 810 taels, and the US dollar listing was large at 25 cents, calculated at 678 taels to 71 taels, and 734 taels in the afternoon, not fluctuating much compared to the previous day. The ledger was 39 taels, the water supplement was 37 taels, and 35 taels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>▲ Various Firms' Inflows and Outflows Were Quite Frequent Trading on the table was quite active, with supply exceeding demand in total. Hengxing Yuan sold over a thousand bars, Yuan Dayong Yuan, Maoyong, Zhifeng Yong, Hongkang Yong, Yuan Tai, Fu Taiheng, Yuankangxiang, Cheng Dayong, and Zhaofeng Chang all sold. Dadecheng sold more than 600 bars, Tong Taichang, Heng Yu, Fuxiang, Yifeng Yong, Yuhe, and others sold and bought from time to time. Hengxing bought more than 300 bars, and Yingfeng Heng and Huinai Setou also bought in. In the later market, Hengxing, Hengchang Yong, Yuan Tai, Yifeng Yong, Cheng Dayong, Yuan Heng, Fuxingyong, and Qian Changxiang all bought in. Shunli, Chengfeng Yong, Yuan Xingyong, Tongchun, Yuan Dayong, Dadecheng, Yuan Maoyong, Fuyu, Hengxing Yuan, Yifeng, and Wu Pin all sold. Zhaofeng Chang, Heng Yu, Hongkang Yong, and Yuhe had mixed inflows and outflows. The Dalian gang's inflows and outflows were about 600 or 700 bars, breaking even. The Cantonese gang bought more than 600 bars and sold about 200 bars. The total number of bars for each firm was estimated to be within 21,000 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Foreign Exchange Trends Towards Looseness <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was no change in the silver market, but the exchange rate plummeted by more than two points, which was unexpected, causing the British gold exchange rate to be hard-pressed, and the US dollar exchange rate was also dragged down. HSBC's listing was extended by one level, with British gold up 2.5 points, at one shilling, eight pence, and 375 cents. The US dollar also increased by 2.5 points, at 29 yuan and 625 cents. The Indian exchange rate increased by 1.5 yuan, the French franc increased by 6 yuan, the German and Dutch currencies each increased by 75 points, and the Singapore dollar decreased by 1 tael and 75 cents. The Hong Kong exchange rate was still calculated at 77 taels, which was almost the actual transaction price of the banks. The British gold exchange rate was surprisingly loose, as the large-scale short-term positions were quite firm, and the United States was willing to purchase with an additional 625 cents, leading to this situation. The US dollar exchange rate was slightly affected, and the market was calm in the early morning, but due to the lurking weakness of the gold price, it broke through 40 taels, and the foreign exchange market was even more sluggish. As a result, the British gold exchange rate increased by 3125 cents compared to the previous day, and the US dollar exchange rate increased by only 1875 cents. The trading was normal in the morning, and seemed lively in the afternoon, but the trend became increasingly loose. The trading volume for British gold was over 100,000 pounds, and for US dollars, it was approximately 600,000 or 700,000 yuan. Most of the Chinese gold merchants were selling, and speculative merchants also had more supply than demand, while there were many transactions between banks, and the Setou of the Bullion market was far away. The settlement price was calculated at 734 taels. According to a survey, the Shoufeng Yong company had approximately 3 million or 4 million yuan in short positions in US dollars. The following is a record of yesterday's trading:</p>
<p>▲ There was a difference of 25 cents in the British exchange rate internal plate throughout the day, from the early morning buying price of one shilling, eight pence, 4375 cents to half a penny, buying price of half a penny to 5625 cents, Zhengjin selling at half a penny for August, Shanghai buying in at 6875 cents for October, Shanghai Zhongfu buying in at 6875 cents for October, Meifeng buying in at 625 to 6875 cents for September, the noon closing price selling at 5625 to 6895 cents, buying price increasing by 625 cents, Sanjing Anda doing a deal with each other at 75 cents for September in the afternoon, Dongya buying in at 8125 cents, MacGallie selling at 9375 cents for November, the closing selling price at 6875 to 8125 cents, buying price at 75 to 875 cents.</p>
<p>▲ The US exchange rate internal plate did not exceed 25 cents of fluctuation from beginning to end, with the selling price for August at 29 yuan and 875 cents, 30 yuan for September, 0125 cents for October, and 025 cents for November. The buying price was 30 yuan to 0375 cents, Huabi buying in at 30 yuan for August, HSBC Shanghai doing a deal with each other at 0625 cents for September, Anda Meifeng also doing a deal at the same price, Anda buying in at 375 cents for November, Shanghai Maixing doing a deal with each other at 4375 cents for November, Helan buying in at 4375 cents for November, the closing selling price at 30 yuan to 0375 cents, the buying price at 125 to half a yuan. In the afternoon, Maixing sold and Shanghai bought in at 0625 cents for August, Maixing bought in at 5625 cents for November, 125 cents for August, Datong buying in at 5625 cents for November, Huabi selling at 0625 cents for August, and also buying in at 1875 cents, Datong also absorbing 4375 cents for October, Zhejiang buying in at 1875 cents for August, Old Citibank and Huabi Maixing buying in at 5625 cents for November, Huabi buying in at 4375 cents for October, the closing selling price at 30 yuan and 0625 cents for this month, 1875 cents for September, 3125 cents for October, and 4375 cents for November. The buying price was 30 yuan and 01875 cents to 05625 cents, and the street price was 1 yuan, equivalent to 3 taels, 3 qian, 7 fen, and 55 li of silver.</p>

<p>National News Agency, London, 5th The London telephone dispatch stated that the long term increased by 25, with the near term being 17 pence and 4375 cents and the far term being 17 pence and a half. The London to New York exchange rate opened at 3 yuan, 4 jiao, 7 fen, and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Extremely Bleak Settlement of Tax Fractions <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sparse Crowds at Market Gatherings: Yesterday at the market gatherings during both the morning and afternoon trading sessions, the number of people was noticeably less, reduced by at least one-third compared to usual. Bank transactions were nearly at a standstill, with onlookers present. The volume of foreign silver transactions was minimal, limited to small private banks (referring to those dealing in spot transactions) engaging in mutual exchanges. There was virtually no activity related to formal demand or applications within the silver and banking industries. Discounted bills were also less common. The overall languid atmosphere of the market was unprecedented this year.</p>
<p>▲ Extremely Slight Fluctuations in Tax Fraction Market Prices: (Foreign Tax Fractions) The morning price was 6 dollars, 8 cents, 8 mills, and 2.5 cash. The afternoon price was lower by 2.5 cash, at 6 dollars, 8 cents, and 8 mills. The end result was the same as the interchanged morning and afternoon prices from the previous day, indicating a thoroughly exhausted situation. (Silver Tax Fractions) The morning price was 1 cent, and the afternoon price was also 1 cent, a slight decrease of 0.1 cents from the previous day. Extra commission plus water was 8 to 9 cents, and the bank street rate was 4 cents. The silver market situation was also quite weak.</p>
<p>▲ Auxiliary Coin Market Mostly Declining: Small Jiangnan silver coins were priced at 6 dollars and 0.5 mills in the morning, down 1.5 mills from the previous day. The afternoon price was the same. Transaction volume was 5,000 角 in the morning and 2,000 角 in the afternoon. Small Guangdong silver coins were priced at 5 dollars, 8 cents, and 3 mills in the morning, and 5 dollars, 8 cents, and 4 mills in the afternoon, resulting in a slight increase of 0.5 mills from the previous day. Transaction volume was 85,000 角 in the morning and 45,000 角 in the afternoon. Copper coins slightly increased by 500 文, to 429,500 文, with a transaction volume of over 48,000 strings.</p>
<p>▲ Stagnant Silver and Foreign Silver Transactions and Settlements: (Silver) Yesterday, bank settlements were very bleak. Chinese merchants' settlement of drafts amounted to 1.7 to 1.8 million, foreign merchants' settlement of drafts amounted to 1.4 to 1.5 million, and settlement of various commodity taxes and miscellaneous fees amounted to over 6 million. Transactions involving collateral amounted to over 900,000. Warehouse entries were 400,000, and warehouse exits were 600,000. Silver shops’ and public banks’ single settlements amounted to over 10.7 million, and settlements with extra commission amounted to over 3.9 million. Settlements of drafts from various routes amounted to over 400,000. Spot cash settlements were completed straight. (Foreign Silver) Draft settlements amounted to 445,000 in the morning session and 460,000 in the afternoon session. Banknote transactions were 20,000 in the morning and 30,000 in the afternoon. Off-exchange banknote transactions were 90,000 in the morning and 55,000 in the afternoon. Single drafts were traded only in the afternoon session for 40,000. Foreign silver transactions by various banks amounted to 400,000 in the morning and 450,000 in the afternoon. Foreign accounts' incoming and outgoing settlements amounted to over 1.4 million. Banknote inflows and outflows amounted to 1.8 to 1.9 million. Foreign banks’ and public banks’ single settlements amounted to 5.7 million. Foreign settlements with extra commission amounted to over 1.7 million. Foreign collateral transactions amounted to over 500,000. Foreign silver borrowing and lending amounted to over 1.3 million. Small private banks' transactions amounted to over 500,000.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Securities: Bond Market Futures Decline, Spot Prices Rise <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 5th), the spot market conditions for various bonds on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a total transaction volume of 21,000 yuan, with the 20th Customs bonds accounting for 10,000 yuan, and the others only several thousand yuan each. There were no transactions in the September futures, and the August futures remained quiet. The total amount opened for both sessions was 2,125,000 yuan, with troop reduction bonds and salt tax bonds each accounting for over 400,000 yuan, in the range of tens of thousands. Customs bonds, reorganization bonds, and the sixth consolidation bonds each accounted for only tens of thousands of yuan. The trend of each bond price still appeared extremely stagnant, with very slight fluctuations between the two sessions, likely due to the quiet market, balanced supply and demand, and expected dull conditions. In the end, spot prices were slightly higher by a few cents compared to the previous day, while futures prices fell back by about 3 to 4 cents. Judging from the situation, it seems more chaotic than before, likely to stagnate in a period of fluctuation without significant rises or falls. It is noted that the recent bond market conditions lack large-scale transactions, so prices also rarely have a consistent trend. Although they often change according to changes in the overall environment, after prices fall too much, they often quickly rise again, and vice versa, ultimately remaining in a fluctuating state.</p>

<p>(Report from American Eastern Silver Company)</p>
<p>On Thursday, the New York stock market saw extremely active trading, with a total daily volume of 3.5 million shares. Market prices continued to reach new highs. Major stocks such as Allied Chemical &amp; Dye Corporation, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, United Drug Company, Electric Bond and Share Company, Loews Cineplex Entertainment, North American Electric Power Corporation, and U.S. Steel Corporation all saw gains of 1 to 2 points. According to a telegram from the Pease Company, there were many profit-takers selling in the afternoon market, but they were readily absorbed by eager buyers, so market prices did not see a pullback. The situation within the market left little room for manipulation by short sellers, so there is unlikely to be a significant reaction in the near future. Attached is the Dow Jones Index as follows:</p>
<p>| Date        | 30 Industrials | 20 Railroads | 20 Utilities |</p>

<h3 id="e143">Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Amidst Multi-Way Speculation <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market shows no clear signs of prosperity or decline. The fluctuation between the morning and afternoon markets is only in the range of four or five cents, making business feel particularly dull. Both sides, the long and short positions, are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. The sales of spot yarn in the market are becoming increasingly quiet. Merchants from various regions feel idle and have no intention of purchasing. However, Rongxing buyers remain calm and unmoved. Sellers, on the other hand, are discouraged by the recent stagnation of actual demand and rumors that Tianjin-produced yarn will be delivered in Shanghai, making people feel particularly bewildered. Judging from the overall trend, it still cannot escape the fluctuating situation.</p>
<p>▲ Subtle Fluctuations in Cotton Yarn Futures: The opening of the yarn futures market in the morning initially fell slightly following the decline in foreign cotton, but then rebounded in the second and third sessions. As a result, the prices for each month remained average, with the distant months falling by one cent. In the afternoon, some of the bullish traders sold off, and the prices rebounded in the second and third sessions, with each month only falling by one cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,850 bales. It was noted that Suilong sold 950 bales, Renfeng sold 450 bales, Changfeng sold 600 bales, and Gengfeng sold 650 bales. Mingde purchased 600 bales, Yuantai purchased 500 bales, Rongxing purchased 550 bales, and Yicheng purchased 350 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>▲ Spot Yarn Opening Only 300 Bales: The depletion of spot yarn remains sluggish. It was noted that the total volume for each region was only 300 bales, with prices falling by about five cents. The amount purchased by each region is listed below:</p>
<p>| Region     | Bales |</p>

<h3 id="e144">The Cotton Market is Stable and Buoyant <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is firm and stable due to the fluctuation of American cotton, which makes people's sentiments strong. However, the amount of selling by large traders has always been without any intention of covering short positions, so the pressure remains heavy. Some people believe that the domestic climate is good, and the new cotton is developing smoothly, which also inclines them to sell. However, a foreign merchant entrusted an Indian merchant to purchase a significant amount of standard cotton in the cotton futures market, intending to buy it because the forward price of American cotton is high, while the forward price of domestic cotton is low. The market situation has become firm and high again. In short, the underlying inventory of domestic cotton is too scarce, and the future will still depend on the fluctuations of American cotton.</p>
<p>▲ Zheng Standard Small Buoyant Trend: The opening of the Zheng Standard market in the morning was due to the slight decline in American cotton, and people's sentiment relaxed, with each month falling by five cents. The second and third sessions then rebounded, resulting in a close that was up five cents for the near months and flat for the distant months. The market situation was even better in the afternoon, but with the price of gold trending down, each month rose by another five cents to one cent. The total transaction volume for the day was 29,500 piculs. It was noted that Suilong sold 4,000 piculs, Yuande sold 600 piculs, Ruiyuan sold 600 piculs, and Tongxing sold 400 piculs. Gengfeng purchased 1,000 piculs, Yuchang purchased 1,000 piculs, Changfeng purchased 600 piculs, Tongfu purchased 700 piculs, Dachang purchased 700 piculs, and Changfeng purchased 600 piculs. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>▲ English Cotton Rebounds... Indian Cotton Market Suspended</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially firm due to strong buying by Wall Street and the public, but then suddenly softened. Futures fell by 5 to 9 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. English cotton futures rose by 12 to 13 points, and spot prices rose by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was suspended.

<h3 id="e148">Grains: New Early Rice Falls by Half a Yuan <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai South: Yesterday, about twenty cargo ships arrived, but the existing inventory was still substantial, and market sales were sluggish. Although there were a few transactions in northern rice, buyers' intentions to purchase were weak. Genuine special-grade goods were priced at 15 yuan upon entry, while mid-grade goods were mostly around 13 yuan, a decrease of two to three cents compared to the previous day. There was a continuous supply of early and late rice, but rural demand remained stagnant. Only a few dozen stones were traded on this street, and prices also fell by two cents. Due to the sunny weather, the supply of new early rice increased, but the market weakened, with the opening price falling by half a yuan, and 蘆洋尖 also decreasing slightly.</p>
<p>▲ New Gate: The number of cargo ships arriving at yesterday's market was not high, and depletion on this street was extremely light. The prices of each commodity fell more sharply than in the southern market. Changshu and Xixi northern rice both fell by two cents, and Shipu and Songjiang thin rice also followed suit, decreasing slightly. Due to the low price of white broken rice, the depletion of 蘆洋尖 was unusually slow, resulting in a weak decline. New early rice fell by the same amount as in the southern market.</p>

<p>▲ Ningbo, Shaoxing, Changshu, and Xixi all purchased enthusiastically</p>
<p>Yesterday, the ocean rice market saw continued active customer demand. Ningbo, Shaoxing, Changshu, and Xixi all purchased small grain rice enthusiastically, taking away 8,000+ bags of both new and old grain.

<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the market for each month generally showed a stable trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat was slightly better by a little over 10 cents. Outsiders in the industry were quite bullish, and since the wheat market was difficult to decline, inland merchants consistently viewed it highly, and each session had purchases. However, Gaofeng was still actively selling because it had a surplus of ordered foreign wheat, and Fuxin also had a lot of flour, so it also sold off. Therefore, the market sentiment was still strong from the initial session to the third session, but then it weakened again. Considering that the northern situation has become tense again in recent days, the current trend will be stagnation, but the future outlook is promising. As a result, the current month was better by 0.5 cents compared to the previous day, September was better by 1 cent, October was better by 1.25 cents, November was better by 0.75 cents, December was better by 1 cent, and January was better by 0.5 cents.</p>

<p>After the opening of the term wheat market yesterday morning, the market for each month continued to show a stable and buoyant trend. The quoted price of foreign wheat was better by about 10 cents. This was not directly related, but the domestic wheat price was trending steady, and the asking price could not fall further, and the weather was arid, and there was no timely rain, which was also the main reason for bringing up market sentiment. Therefore, the buying interest has remained keen recently, and there were rumors that the government would levy import taxes on the distant months, which made the market sentiment particularly stable. Whether this is true is still difficult to determine at the moment. As a result, the current month rose by 3 cents compared to the previous day, September rose by 3 cents, October rose by 5 cents, November rose by 4 cents, December rose by 3 cents. The spot wheat market remained quiet with arrivals, and prices were still stable. The opening price of Penglai wheat was 3.22 cents, totaling 400 bags.</p>

<p>▲ Number Plate might need to drop slightly</p>
<p>Since Haikou branches have new supply, and because the cargo price has been agreeable, sales venues have been very active, the previous batches that have arrived have mostly been completely sold out, it has now been heard that yesterday the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou ship came in with an import, with over three-thousand more crates arriving, the amount is relatively more than previously, today the samples can probably be seen, this time's opening price has the hope of being slightly loosened, but not to the point of being overly out of line, they say.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the transaction volume for metal goods remained ordinary and stagnant. The amount of customers and factory businesses also felt sluggish, and the construction business was also flat and uneventful. Therefore, the general trends in the whole city remained unchanged without special progress. The following information has been recorded on the market conditions of yesterday:</p>
<p>▲ English steel plates had slight openings yesterday. The Qingdao and Tianjin businesses were slightly active yesterday, so four to five hundred "dan" were opened.

The estimated price for each "dan" is seven taels and seven "qian" and a half for No. 22, nine taels for No. 24, ten taels and five "qian" for No. 26, and eleven taels for No. 28.</p>

<p>▲ Clarifying Okazaki's Original Letter</p>
<p>Recently, Okazaki, the representative of the Japanese Joint Committee, sent a letter to Keeningham, the chairman of the Joint Committee, stating that the Chinese government had suddenly reorganized troops into police in Zhabei and other places, and had also equipped them with field artillery. He requested that the Joint Committee pay close attention to this matter. At that time, Keeningham immediately sent a copy of Okazaki's original letter to Yu Hongjun, the Chinese representative. Mr. Yu immediately sent a reasoned reply to the Joint Committee, stating: "I received your letter, which included a letter from Mr. Okazaki, the Japanese representative, to your chairman. After reading it, I am extremely surprised. I do not understand why the Japanese representative finds it necessary to interfere with the Chinese government's measures to maintain local public security. The Chinese government has consistently treated friendly nations with sincerity and openness, which is evident to both the Japanese government and people. However, the Japanese representative still makes reckless speculations, which is deeply regrettable. The Chinese government has the right to adopt any of the best measures to maintain local order and tranquility, which I must repeatedly declare. However, the Chinese government, in exercising its inherent sovereignty, has no need to disguise troops as police."</p>
<h3 id="e163">A Large Number of Japanese Warships Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ Shanghai Has as Many as Fifteen Japanese Warships</p>
<p>The Japanese Navy Fleet of the Yangtze River has recently been ordered by Sakonji, the commander of the Third Fleet, to redeploy its forces, concentrating a portion of the departing warships in Shanghai. At the same time, it has also ordered warships stationed upstream of the Yangtze River to protect Japanese vessels and safeguard the promotion of Japanese goods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Warships of the Yangtze River Redeployed to Shanghai The destroyers "Yanagi," "Momo," "Kashi," and "Hinoki" of the 24th Squadron of the Japanese Navy were redeployed to Shanghai during the January 28th Incident. After the ceasefire, they joined the First Overseas Dispatch Squadron and were stationed in Nanjing, Daye, and other places. Since the "Blood Soul Corps" incident in Shanghai, the Japanese Naval Ministry had already sent all four warships of the 15th Squadron to Shanghai. Now, it has telegraphed the light cruiser "Tenryu," stationed in Nanjing, and the four destroyers of the 24th Squadron to Shanghai. At 10:10 AM yesterday, the "Tenryu" entered the port. At 12:35 PM, the four destroyers arrived at Wusong. In the afternoon, they sailed into the Huangpu River and anchored in the Yangshupu area.</p>
<p>▲ A Significant Increase in Japanese Warships in the Huangpu River After the withdrawal of Japanese troops after the war, only three Japanese warships remained in Shanghai. Since the arrival of the four warships of the 15th Squadron, as of yesterday, there are a total of fifteen Japanese warships in the Huangpu River, including "Tsushima," "Hozu," "Izumo," "Ataka," "Hira," "Seta," and the destroyers "Yanagi," "Momo," "Kashi," "Hinoki," "Usu," "Kuzu," "Fuji," and "Ogi." Their berthing locations stretch from the Huangpu River to the Zhabei River mouth. The "Urakaze," on the other hand, has been redeployed to Nanjing. The Japanese naval presence in Shanghai has once again greatly increased.</p>
<p>▲ The Situation of Japanese Goods Being Transported to Hankou After the resumption of loading on the 26th of last month, a large quantity of Japanese goods was exported on the Yangtze River. Recently, after the warning from the "Blood Soul Corps," most unscrupulous merchants dare not openly transport them. The route for Japanese goods on the Yangtze River has once again been halted. However, inferior Japanese goods are still being shipped to the Yangtze River in a continuous stream. A large quantity is stored at the postal pier. On the 4th of this month, the Japanese vessel "Xiangyang Maru" resumed normal loading and transport. It is said that Japanese merchants have consulted with the Shanghai-based navy and are still following the navy's method of controlling Japanese vessels on the Yangtze River from last month. For any Japanese goods loaded to Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Changsha, and other ports, the First Overseas Dispatch Squadron headquarters will secretly telegraph the Japanese warships stationed at those ports. When the Japanese goods arrive at the docks for unloading, the navy will use its strength to assist in unloading and bringing them ashore. Therefore, inferior goods can once again be transported as usual.</p>

<p>▲ Jiu Shen and Yong Yu Each Receive a Bomb</p>
<p>The Shanghai "Blood Soul Corps" has discovered that Jiu Shen Yarn Shop in Dongde Lane, North Suzhou Road, and Yong Yu Cotton Shop in Tongfang Lane, Shilu, are still secretly selling Japanese goods. Therefore, yesterday (the 5th), they sent a bomb to each of the stores and left a warning note, roughly stating: "If you continue to sell Japanese goods, our final bullets will be merciless." The original notes are recorded below: (1) Note to Yong Yu Cotton Shop: "Yong Yu store owner, be warned. You still do not know how to repent and dare to sell enemy goods. We have left a bomb. Quickly seal up the Japanese goods and issue a statement in the newspaper declaring that you will never sell enemy goods again. Our organization has a network of informers everywhere. The final judgment is fast approaching, and our bullets will be merciless. Quickly come to your senses. The Shanghai 'Blood Soul Corps,' August 5th."

<p>▲ To Warn Against Selling Japanese Goods</p>
<p>The Maochang Foreign Goods Store, located at 347 Minguo Road in the French Concession, continues to sell Japanese goods. At 9:05 PM last night, someone suddenly threw a bomb into the store. With a loud bang, it exploded immediately. However, it was intended as a warning, so the explosive force was very weak. Fortunately, no one was injured. The bomber, seeing that the purpose had been achieved, immediately ran away. Subsequently, nearby police officers arrived after hearing the sound and arrested the bomber, taking him to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The National Salvation Ten-Man League Warns Three Seafood Stores <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>▲ Attached with a Bullet and a Packet of Explosives</p>
<p>▲ Urging Them to Stop Selling Japanese Seafood Immediately</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, a group claiming to be the Shanghai National Salvation Ten-Man League sent a letter with a bullet and a packet of explosives to three seafood stores in the South City: Gong Shun, Sheng Ji, and Qia Feng, with the following warning: "To the esteemed managers of Gong Shun, Sheng Ji, and Qia Feng: According to confidential reports from various sources, your stores have been engaging in the audacious act of passing off seafood caught by Japanese fishing boats as seafood caught by Chinese boats, deceiving the public for a long time. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, countless of our compatriots were directly or indirectly brutalized and sacrificed under the enemy's cannons. The scars of the Songhu battle are still fresh. Moreover, alarms are frequently being raised these days about the Japanese army in Rehe, which is repeatedly engaging in aggressive acts. Anyone with blood in their veins, at this critical moment for our nation's survival, when our fate hangs by a thread, should be united in our hatred of the enemy and work together to resist Japan. It is unexpected that your stores, amidst the calls for boycotts, are acting recklessly, ignoring the country's demise, and undermining the entire anti-Japanese unity. You are the worst kind of traitors. Such betrayal of conscience and digging of your own graves is utterly despicable. Your actions violate Article 8 of our League's regulations and deserve punishment to serve as a warning to others. We hereby give your stores a deadline. Within three days of receiving this letter, you must sever all ties with Japanese merchants and stop selling seafood caught by Japanese fishing boats. Otherwise, if you dare to ignore this warning, and if our League dispatches members to investigate and confirm the facts, we will send you bombs, replicating the story of the Yongchang Coal Company. To preserve your stores' reputations, we are first sending a written warning, along with a bullet and a packet of explosives, to express our League's initial respect and to serve as a warning. Respectfully addressed to Li Mingde of Gong Shun Seafood Store, Zheng Yunsheng of Sheng Ji Seafood Store, and Lu Jintang of Qia Feng Seafood Store. From the Shanghai Chinese National Salvation Ten-Man League."</p>
<h3 id="e167">Coal Industry Association Holds Emergency Meeting After Receiving Warnings <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>▲ Circular to Members Encouraging Them to Fill Out Volunteer Forms</p>
<p>▲ Continuing to Receive Three Letters Singling Out Firms for Attention</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, after receiving two warnings and a hand grenade the day before, the Shanghai Coal Industry Association held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss how to respond. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Meeting Details The association held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon, attended by Mao Chunpu, Wei Hongwen, Shen Jinzhou, Wu Shunshan, Chen Yushu, Chen Erchang, Chen Youlan, Tian Efang, Lu Qisheng, and others. Wei Hongwen chaired the meeting. The chairman first reported that at 4 PM on August 3rd, a young person delivered a bundle of newspapers, claiming that they were forwarded by the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that they should be given to the association's members. Upon opening the bundle, they found a hand grenade and an accompanying note. In addition to reporting this to the police, they should hold an emergency meeting to discuss how to respond. After discussion, it was decided to publish a notice to all members to jointly promote domestic goods: (1) Fill out a volunteer form to promote domestic goods; (2) After the volunteer forms are filled out, publish them in the newspaper.</p>
<p>▲ Notice to Members Regarding the notice, the association held a temporary emergency meeting on August 5th to openly discuss how to respond to the hand grenade case discovered on August 3rd. The results were: (1) Publish a notice to all members to jointly promote domestic goods; (2) Fill out a volunteer form to promote domestic goods; (3) After the volunteer forms are completed, publish them in the newspaper. In addition to publishing a notice, we have urgently prepared volunteer forms and are sending them to all members. We hope that all members will follow the good example of patriotism and quickly fill out the volunteer form to promote domestic goods, officially sign, and seal it before August 14th. Return the completed volunteer form to the association for publication. This measure is a follow-up plan to prevent unexpected dangers to members on the market. We sincerely hope that all members fully understand and do not delay. Those who do not wish to fill out the form will not be forced by the association. This notice is issued.</p>
<p>▲ Continuing to Receive Three Letters The association continued to receive three letters by mail yesterday morning. They are recorded below: (1) Letter from the "Blood Soul Corps": "Esteemed sirs, our organization has dispatched a special agent to deliver this letter, requesting that you adopt the two points mentioned previously and quickly respond in the newspapers. Otherwise, we will take effective measures. Please note. This letter is again sent to all executive committee members and all members of the Shanghai Coal Industry Association." (2) Letter from a patriotic individual: "To the directors of the Coal Industry Association: Recently, unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai have only been concerned with their own interests, disregarding national affairs, which is truly heartbreaking. For the sake of the country and for the sake of our descendants, I must inform you to take action as soon as possible. Gu Zhongshou of Yicheng Xin Coal Shop, located at 582 Xizang Road, has recently imported over 1,000 tons of Japanese coal. If your association does not believe this, you can send someone to investigate secretly. If it is true, please take measures to remove this traitor. This is of utmost importance. Furthermore, I have reported to your association several times, hoping that you have received it and have taken appropriate action. From a patriotic individual." (3) Letter from the "Iron Blood Corps": "Esteemed sirs, our organization has learned that Shengchang Coal Shop, a member of your association, is daring to openly buy and sell Japanese coal, which is a hostile act. Our organization originally intended to deal with them using hand grenades. However, upon reading today's newspaper that you are holding an emergency meeting today to discuss how to deal with Japanese coal, we are sending this letter to report: (1) Limit them to stop selling hostile coal within one week; (2) Issue a statement in the newspaper within three days declaring compliance. If they persist in their error, they will be crushed to pieces and will regret it too late. This is a warning to Shengchang Coal Shop. We hope that you will vigorously advise them. Addressed to the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, from the Iron Blood Corps."</p>
<h3 id="e168">Various Industries Intensify Boycotts of Enemy Goods <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Commercial Association of Fourth High Road The Commercial Association of Fourth High Road (Fuzhou Road) has observed that enemy goods have become active again recently, and that extermination squads and other groups have been warning various businesses. To prevent problems from arising, the association has issued a special notice to its members: "To all members: The patriotic enthusiasm of our association's members has always been unwavering. Since the September 18th Incident, our members, motivated by a desire to save the country, have voluntarily sealed up enemy goods and vowed never to buy or sell Japanese goods. Our association has previously urged the sealing up of goods. Recently, a few unscrupulous individuals have undermined the boycott of enemy goods, affecting the entire city and causing resentment among patriots. We hope that our association's members will redouble their efforts to uphold their original intention of boycotting enemy goods, strive to persevere to the end, and avoid interference from others, so as to avoid unexpected dangers. This notice is hereby issued. Please comply.</p>
<p>▲ Umbrella Trade Association The Shanghai Umbrella Trade Association held its 25th Executive Committee meeting the day before. Nine committee members and over 30 factory representatives attended. Lu Zhankui chaired the meeting. (A) The chairman reported: "Since the Wan-Shen Incident, our association has resolved at a general meeting of members that all members, both within and outside the association, should no longer use raw materials from the enemy. All members have long implemented this. Then, we suffered the tragedy of the January 28th Shanghai War. Anyone with blood in their veins cannot help but feel pained. Throughout the interior, people are all enthusiastically saving the country. Moreover, our members are located in the war zone and have witnessed the tragedy firsthand. How could we willingly act improperly, be spat upon by thousands of people, and place ourselves in the position of traitors? Our association has done its best to offer sincere advice. However, with the passage of time, we may become lax. Recently, we have seen reports that the customs has reported that the import of enemy goods has once again topped all countries, and they are active again in the market. We hope that all members of our association will maintain their original intention, be united in spirit, persevere to the end, and never change until death." (B) Matters for discussion: (1) Committee member Zhao Tianmin proposed that all members jointly organize a Shanghai National Goods Umbrella United Sales Office, stating: "Our national goods umbrella trade members total over 30, with annual sales reaching over 5 million yuan. However, they usually operate independently, selling separately. There is no effect of coordination, nor is there the benefit of cooperation. To compete with foreign goods, united sales are necessary. Therefore, we propose to prepare for the 'National Goods Umbrella United Sales Office.' Please decide whether this is appropriate." It was decided to actively prepare. (2) Regarding the recent resurgence of enemy goods on the market, how should our association respond? It was decided to urge members to persevere in their original intention of boycotting enemy goods and never change until death. (Other matters omitted.)</p>
<p>▲ Sugar Trade Association The Sugar Trade Association held its second Executive Committee meeting at the sugar market the day before. Fourteen committee members attended, chaired by Zheng Zenan. Matters for discussion: (1) Handling the case of the private sale of inferior sugar by Dongyang. It was decided that the defense sent by Dongyang was not credible. The company should be informed to issue a statement on the front page of the Shen Bao and Xin Wen newspapers for three days, stating that they will never again sell inferior sugar. If they do not accept the proposal, they will be expelled. (2) Handling the case of the sealed up Japanese refined sugar, as instructed by the general meeting. It was decided to temporarily retain the case. (3) Funding for the National Self-Salvation Association. It was decided to subsidize the association with 50 yuan. (4) Regarding the City Chamber of Commerce's request for representatives to participate in the Abolish Civil War Grand Alliance, it was decided to appoint Mr. Zheng Zenan and Mr. Xu Jingfu as representatives to attend. (5) Committee member Yang reported that smuggled sugar from Liuhe and Zhaopu was being sold in the interior. It was decided to petition the Customs Administration to investigate and ban it. (6) The chairman proposed that it has been heard that sugar substitutes sold on the market contain toxic substances. It was proposed to purchase a sample and send it to the Social Affairs Bureau for testing. It was decided to purchase a bottle and send it to the Health Bureau for testing. If it contains toxic substances, the public should be warned not to purchase it in the newspapers to emphasize health. (7) Reorganizing regulations. It was decided that the payment period for sugar purchased by various merchant groups should follow industry regulations and should not be delayed. The silver discount should be 5 qian per 1,000 taels and should not be deducted more. All samples stored should be cancelled and no more silver should be deducted. All members should be notified to comply.</p>
<p>▲ Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Association The Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Association held a meeting of members yesterday afternoon at 4 PM to thoroughly investigate whether members were purchasing Japanese rice. Cai Yukun chaired the meeting, reported on the proceedings, and read aloud the letters received from members reporting their rice stocks, then handed them over for discussion. (1) Regarding the case of the foreign rice stored in various warehouses by Tongxingtai, which has already been sampled by the association and should be publicly inspected, it was decided that the registration book of Tongxingtai was checked against the dates and quantities of the foreign rice that arrived at various warehouses. It was found that, except for three receipts where the dates of loading and arrival did not match, the rest were consistent. Now, the rice samples collected by the association have been publicly inspected and confirmed to be old rice. This is confirmed by the company's previous letter, which stated that this foreign rice was ordered before the September 18th Incident last year. This cannot be said to be untrue. Regarding the three receipts where the dates of loading and arrival did not match, it is considered suspicious and should be banned. The receipts that match the association's registration shall be allowed to be bought and sold. However, the warehouse receipts must be sent to the association for verification and stamping before being announced to the market to show seriousness. Regarding the rice transported from Hong Kong, the company should also send the bill of lading to the association for verification and stamping. If it is indeed loaded by Tongxingtai, it may be allowed to be bought and sold according to the previous method. (2) Regarding the letter from the North Office of the Bean and Rice Industry, which stated that Shu Zhanyuan, the manager of Rentai Trading Co. in Zhabei, was falsely accused by a certain tabloid of transporting Japanese rice and should be thoroughly investigated, it was decided that the truth of the matter must be thoroughly investigated. Chairman Cai was invited to meet with Committee Member Jiang Hongbin of the Bean and Rice Industry Association and the responsible personnel of the North Office at 10 AM on the 7th to thoroughly investigate the foreign rice stored by Rentai Trading Co. and report to the association for verification. (3) Regarding the letter from the Heji Rice Mill stating that it was reported that they had purchased Japanese rice and requesting a thorough investigation and correction, it was decided to reply to the mill that since they did not purchase it, they should send a letter to correct it themselves. The meeting adjourned after 6 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The City Chamber of Commerce Establishes a Special Committee to Study the Abolition of the Tael and the Adoption of the Yuan <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>▲ Twelve Opinions Received from Various Industries</p>
<p>▲ Second Meeting Scheduled for the 10th of This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, after its third Executive Committee meeting, decided to establish a special research committee on the issue of abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan. Zhu Wenqi, Fang Jiaobo, Ma Jiliang, Luo Qinghua, Lu Wenshao, Chen Zheqing, and Pei Yunqing were appointed as members of the committee. On one hand, opinions from various industries were collected as a basis for research. As of yesterday, a total of 12 opinions had been received from various industries. The research committee held its first committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 2 PM. Committee members Zhu Wenqi, Fang Jiaobo, Ma Jiliang, Luo Qinghua, and Lu Wenshao attended. Zhu Wenqi chaired the meeting. The secretariat first reported on the opinions received from various industries one by one. After detailed discussion by the committee members, it was decided that (1) the issue is of great importance. The association will first send the received opinions to the committee members for detailed consideration; (2) The association is collecting opinions from chambers of commerce across the country. They should be collected and submitted to the committee meeting for joint research next Monday; (3) The second committee meeting is scheduled for next Wednesday (the 10th).</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Zhu Wenqi, the director of the research committee, yesterday, asking him to express his views on the abolition of the tael and the adoption of the yuan. According to him, from an objective standpoint and based on economic theory, he advocates that (1) the weight and fineness of the new silver coins should be based on the silver coins with the lowest silver fineness currently circulating on the market. The phenomenon of bad money driving out good money is theoretically and practically unavoidable. If bad money can circulate on the market, good silver coins will be melted down. Therefore, after the appearance of Yuan Shikai silver coins, Jiangnan silver coins decreased. After the appearance of Sun Yat-sen silver coins, Yuan Shikai silver coins gradually disappeared. Therefore, if the fineness of the new silver coins is higher than that of the bad coins circulating on the market, there will inevitably be the problem of manufacturing on one hand and melting down on the other hand. Conversely, if, as advocated by Dexi, all kinds of mixed silver coins are recalled after the implementation of the new currency, there will naturally be no problem; (2) How to regulate the conversion ratio between silver tael contracts and silver coins during the valid period? He advocates the following methods: (A) The government issues an order that, for example, if the tael is abolished on January 1, 1933, then all previous silver tael contracts will be converted at the market price on December 31, 1932; (B) The government orders that, for example, if the abolition of the tael is implemented on September 1 of next year, then silver tael contracts can still be converted at the market price during this one-year period. For long-term contracts, the two parties can negotiate a compromise price, or the local chamber of commerce can negotiate a compromise price and ask the government to approve it; (3) What methods should be adopted to make the general public understand and trust this change? He believes that the opinions of the money industry and Gerhard should be adopted, such as: (A) The issuance of banknotes should have at least 60% reserve cash and should not be offset by other items; (B) Public groups should conduct public inspections at any time; (C) Free transportation; (D) The Central Mint should be the only mint in China, and all other factories should be dismantled; (4) He believes that the cost of minting new silver coins should be borne by the people, as stipulated in the Three People's Principles. Germany, France, and Japan have all done this. If the government bears the cost, the people can melt the new coins at any time to replace silver. To illustrate, silver shops do not need to buy silver bars, which requires more procedures. They only need to melt silver coins for use, while the state must process and mint them at a great loss. The above are his personal opinions, which will be contributed to the research committee for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Shanghai and England Can Communicate by Wireless Telephone <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Daily, on Wednesday evening, the Italian postal ship "Conte Rosso" invited many celebrities from Shanghai to a dinner to see the newly installed wireless telephone. The Italian Minister Count Ciano personally made a phone call to Rome, talking with his father, the Minister of Communications, for a while. He then switched to Bolzano, a town 1,000 miles from Rome, to talk with his mother and sister. Both were very clear. The wireless telephone machine was produced by the Marconi Company and is the same as the ones installed on the English liner "Queen" and the "White Plains", both of which are very beautiful. At that time, the terrestrial line was borrowed from Rome to London. However, because there was no prior consultation, the London operator initially refused to transfer the call. When Count Ciano informed his father of this situation, a reply was received within a few minutes. The Italian Ministry of Communications had contacted the London Postal Authority, and the British Postal Authority had obtained permission from the British Foreign Office to open the telephone line between London and Rome for one hour, preparing to transfer the telephone calls from Shanghai. So, a re-test was performed last night (the 4th). A reporter from the London Times in Shanghai spoke to the London Post Office, asking them to transfer the call to the</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Times newspaper office. At that time, the reporter wanted to speak directly with the Times newspaper, but was restricted by government regulations and asked the post office staff to forward the message. In addition, the reporter also had a private telegram, which was also entrusted to the London Post Office staff for delivery.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 5th: Last night, the Italian postal ship "Conte Rosso" in Shanghai spoke with the Minister of Communications in Rome via wireless telephone. Subsequently, a reporter from the London Times stationed in Shanghai spoke with London on the ship, which was very clear. However, the call was suddenly interrupted because the call between Shanghai and London had not been tested by the authorities. This morning, the Times published an editorial asking the public to pay attention to this matter, criticizing the post office for adhering to old rules and failing to cooperate with the Italian Minister of Communications in a spirit of enlightenment. The newspaper also advocated the rapid development of wireless telephone services between China and Britain, as this is extremely important for commerce.</p>
<h3 id="e171">City Chamber of Commerce Strives to Recover Pilotage Rights <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>▲ Vacancies for Pilots Should Be Filled by Chinese</p>
<p>▲ Chamber of Commerce Representatives Should Join the Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shipping Affairs Office, stating: Sirs, It is a common practice in various countries around the world to select their own nationals for the position of pilot. In the seventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, our country established general regulations for pilots at various seaports, allowing Chinese citizens and nationals of treaty countries who wished to become pilots to be employed equally. This open approach was unique to our country and not bound by treaties. Furthermore, the employment of foreign pilots at the mouth of the Yangtze River is not mentioned in the general regulations for pilots at various seaports, and has no legal basis. However, over time, foreign pilots have forgotten their place, gradually seeking to seize power and exclude Chinese from participating, reversing the roles of guest and host, causing resentment among Chinese. Since the tenth year of the Republic of China, there has been a movement to reclaim pilotage rights. Your office should be aware of these circumstances. According to the general regulations for pilots at various seaports, the pilot profession is under your office's jurisdiction, and as a Chinese government agency, you should strive to realize matters beneficial to the Chinese nation and people. We propose that your office instruct the foreign pilot association to: (1) Regardless of whether the association expands the number of pilots in the future or when vacancies arise, all replacements and trainees should be Chinese; (2) The association's previous promise to add five Chinese members should not be empty talk but should be realized promptly; (3) Since the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce already occupies a seat on the association's committee, our Chamber of Commerce should also be allowed to join a member to ensure fairness. We respectfully submit this letter, requesting your office to investigate and handle it accordingly. Addressed to the Jianghai Customs Shipping Affairs Office.</p>

<h3 id="e174">General Overview of Municipal Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure for the 20th Year <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>▲ Deficit of Over 1.1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter, seeking to inquire about the city's treasury revenue and expenditure, visited the responsible personnel of the Municipal Finance Bureau. They provided detailed information about the fiscal revenue and expenditure figures for the 20th year and the impact of the January 28th Incident, which is recorded below for the reference of those concerned about the city's finances. (1) The revenue for the 20th year was over 8.21 million yuan, an increase of over 1 million yuan compared to the 19th year, making it the highest revenue in the city's fiscal history. If not for the results of reorganizing old taxes throughout the year following the January 28th Incident, the total revenue could have reached 9 million yuan. (2) The expenditure for the 20th year was over 9.33 million yuan, exceeding the budget by over 1 million yuan, and an increase of over 1.7 million yuan compared to the 19th year. The excessive expenditure on temporary expenses (totaling over 2.5 million yuan), particularly the special expenses and rehabilitation costs after the Shanghai Incident, was the largest contributor. Compared to the 19th year, it was approximately 1 million yuan higher, and even exceeded the temporary budget for the 20th year by over 1.47 million yuan. This led to an extraordinary strain on the city's treasury. At the end of the year, the revenue and expenditure were balanced, resulting in a deficit of over 1.1 million yuan, which must be carried over to the next year for offset. The bureau has prepared a comparative table of revenue and expenditure calculations for the 20th and 19th years and submitted it to the mayor for review.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Attending the Chicago Exposition Preparatory Committee, a Banquet was Held at the Xi Garden Yesterday to Honor Elder <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Chicago Exposition Preparatory Committee held a tea party at the Xi residence on Jing'an Temple Road at 5:00 PM yesterday to welcome Dr. Elder, the representative of the Chicago Exposition. Guests included Mayor Wu, Cai Yuanpei, Lin Baike, Zou Bingwen, Chen Liting, He Dekui, Wen Yinxing, Shen Junyi, and over fifty Westerners, creating a grand occasion. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Circumstances of the Banquet The tea party was held at the Xi family garden, with Zhang Xianglin, Zhang Yichou, He Bingxian, and others providing sincere hospitality. Mr. and Mrs. Elder arrived last, shaking hands with each guest present. They then took their seats together, with Mr. Elder sitting with Cai Yuanpei and others, engaging in pleasant conversation. He also went to the reporters' table to discuss the nature of the exposition. Mr. Elder was amiable and approachable, and socialized with the guests until the event ended around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Elder's Speech After taking his seat, Dr. Elder went to the reporters' table to address the reporters, saying, "I also started as a reporter and previously worked for the American 'Thames', so I have a strong connection with reporters. The upcoming Chicago Exposition is a very novel event, a centennial celebration of material progress. Therefore, the exposition is also called the Centennial Exposition of Material Progress. This century of progress is entirely the result of scientific development. The purpose of the exposition is to represent the spirit of various materials and to illustrate how science has enabled such rapid progress. Some people find it strange that China is participating in the centennial celebration, but they do not realize that the new China has made considerable progress and definitely has a need to participate. Therefore, when the Chinese ambassador visited the president of the exposition, he requested a space for China. The president immediately chose the best location for China to display its exhibits. Since the Boxer Rebellion, the United States has had a strong sympathy for China and has become a very close ally. They also feel that China is moving towards progress. The United States can deeply observe China's progress. For example, in a large public gathering, one may feel that one is walking very slowly, but observers can see that one is progressing very quickly. I believe that China's current progress is the same as the United States' progress at that time. Therefore, the United States is eager to know how China is progressing. I have recently had several meetings with Chinese officials and feel that the Chinese authorities are paying great attention to this exposition and have very important proposals. I am also very willing to accept them sincerely."</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Elder's Itinerary Mr. Elder is scheduled to go to Hangzhou today and then to Shanghai via Hangzhou on Sunday (the 27th) before heading to Beijing. He will stay in Beijing for about two days to discuss important matters with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai on Wednesday, invited to banquets by Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government and Mr. Hu Wen, the general manager of the American Feng Bank. Last night, the American Commercial Counselor An Lide also invited Mr. Elder to a banquet.</p>

<p>▲ Immediately Forwarding Letter to the Ratepayers' Association for Review</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Land Committee, according to the resolution of the Western ratepayers' annual meeting on April 13th of this year, added two Chinese committee members. British Consul General Brenan and American Consul General Cunningham visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government two weeks ago to seek his opinion. Mayor Wu expressed not only his agreement but also his belief that it was necessary. Recently, American Consul General and Senior Consul Cunningham formally notified the Municipal Government in writing and regarding the method of producing members, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government sent a special letter to the Chinese ratepayers' association seeking their opinion. The original letter is recorded as follows: Sirs, Regarding the case of adding Chinese committee members to the Land Committee of the Public Concession, we have received a letter from the acting secretary of the Municipal Council stating that the Council has given the matter its attention. This matter has been forwarded. We have now received a letter from American Consul General and Senior Consul Cunningham stating that the Western ratepayers passed the following resolution at the annual meeting on April 13th of this year: This meeting considers the addition of two Chinese committee members to the Land Committee to be an appropriate move. Therefore, the Municipal Council is authorized and instructed to present everything to the relevant countries so that the Land Committee can add two Chinese committee members. The Shanghai Western Ratepayers' Association also stated that in addition to presenting the resolution to the relevant authorities, it hopes to protect the rights of Chinese ratepayers who are not owners. The rights of Chinese ratepayers are best protected by special regulations: (A) One of the two newly added Chinese committee members of the Land Committee must be appointed by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association. The appointee must not be an owner or a representative of an owner. The remainder are to be appointed by a meeting of Chinese owners. (B) In order to determine the qualifications of Chinese committee members of the Land Committee in accordance with the above principles, candidates for Chinese committee members must be selected after agreement between the Municipal Council and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and between the Municipal Council and the Chinese Owners' Association.) Before the above resolutions and their attachments are implemented, Article 6(a) of the Yangjingbang Regulations must be amended. In accordance with Article 28 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, all construction and modification matters must be agreed upon by the consuls of the various countries and the Chinese local officials. Therefore, this Senior Consul requests that Your Excellency the Mayor consider the above proposals as soon as possible, and we hope that you will inform us of whether or not you agree. In accordance with the order to examine the case and notify the Ratepayers' Association, this letter is sent. We hope that your association will respond quickly to the letter's opinions and return them to the government for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e178">American Radio Telegraph Company Will Protest to Us Again <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that according to Hickling, the Shanghai manager of the American Radio Telegraph Company, the radio telegraph contract signed by the Chinese Ministry of Transportation and the Mackay Company, as reported in the Chinese newspapers, directly violates the contract signed between the Chinese government and the American Radio Telegraph Company on November 10, 1928. Therefore, a protest was previously lodged with the Ministry of Transportation, but the Ministry ignored it. Therefore, it is now planned to lodge a serious protest with the Ministry again. It is said that personnel from the Chinese Radio Management Office and several influential Chinese public groups are supporting this action.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Dutch Merchants in Java Reject the Aiboer Electric Light Bulb <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>▲ Various Groups are Greatly Indignant</p>
<p>The Chinese Aiboer Electric Appliance Factory has been in operation for many years, specializing in the manufacture of electric light bulbs, electric fans, and motors. Its products are sold throughout the country and exported to various ports in Southeast Asia, such as Siam and Burma. Due to their low prices and excellent quality, they are very popular among the local people. In Java, Dutch East Indies, they are sold through the Chinese Qingnian Trading Company, and the business is very developed. Therefore, the Dutch Philips Bulb Company in the area is very jealous and has repeatedly tried to slander and hinder its sales. In February of this year, they used the excuse that the Half Bulb was their patent and filed a lawsuit with the local Dutch government, ordering the Aiboer sales office to stop selling. Because the area is completely within the Dutch sphere of influence, the Dutch can do whatever they want. The Aiboer Half Bulb was sacrificed to this evil force. Recently, the Philips Company in the area felt that among the thirty or so types of light bulbs sold in Java, the Aiboer long filament electric light bulb was still a strong competitor to the company in terms of quality. Therefore, they did not hesitate to twist the facts and even claimed that the extremely common glass tube evacuation method in the world was patented by the company. They again filed a lawsuit with the local government, prohibiting the sale of Aiboer light bulbs in the area and demanding compensation for losses. In addition to hiring lawyers to defend themselves in court, the Aiboer sales office also telegraphed the Aiboer headquarters for instructions. The Aiboer headquarters has now requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate on the basis of reason and law, and has also requested assistance from various powerful groups. Famous groups in Shanghai, such as the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association, the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, and the National Goods Factory Federation, are all very indignant at the Dutch Philips' unreasonable rejection of Chinese goods. It is a small matter that the Aiboer Company loses a part of its business, but it greatly affects the overseas trade of all national goods. Therefore, a large-scale joint meeting will soon be held to decide on effective countermeasures.</p>

<p>Division Commander Xu Tingyao reported that Huoqiu was severely affected by the disaster and that the 60,000 to 70,000 yuan of disaster relief funds that should have been allocated earlier had not been distributed. He telegraphed Xu Shiying and asked him to investigate and allocate the funds immediately. In addition to replying by telegram, Xu also telegraphed Quan Shaowu, the disaster relief commissioner in northern Anhui, to investigate and allocate the funds. The telegram to Commissioner Quan Shaowu is recorded as follows: Quan Shaowu, Commissioner of the Anhui Northern Anhui Disaster Relief Office in Bengbu, I received a telegram from Xu Tingyao, Division Commander in Huoqiu, stating that the disaster situation in Huoqiu is dire and urgently needs relief. The National Government Relief Association previously allocated more than 1 million yuan in disaster relief funds, which was shared among 21 counties in northern Anhui. Huoqiu should have been allocated 60,000 to 70,000 yuan, but the county has been in bandit areas for a long time and the funds have not been distributed. This disaster relief fund should still exist. Please distribute the 60,000 to 70,000 yuan allocated to Huoqiu as soon as possible. I hope you will reply soon. What is the statistical amount of disaster relief funds and wheat that have actually been distributed to Huoqiu, who received them, have they been distributed, and is there any remaining amount? If so, where is it stored? I hope you will investigate in detail and reply by telegram so that I can forward it. Xu Shiying, Wang Zhen, Jiang Yin, respectfully.</p>

<p>▲ Hailstorm Causes Complete Loss of Crops</p>
<p>The Xinwei Relief Association has received many telegrams requesting disaster relief from Shaanxi in recent days. The two most recent telegrams are recorded as follows, so that the severity of the disaster in Shaanxi can be known. (1) The Xinwei Relief Association, from Zhao Baozhen, the magistrate of the X county, who reported that in Liunan Village and other places in the northern countryside on July 11th at about 4:00 PM, strong winds uprooted trees, roof tiles flew, and hailstones fell, as large as chicken eggs, accumulating several inches on the ground. The autumn crops that were soaked were completely shattered, and the low-lying areas were almost completely submerged. A total of 81 hectares of land in each village were submerged, and more than 31 hectares of autumn fields were damaged. The villagers were terrified and weeping, which was unbearable to witness. We sincerely request that you find a way to provide relief. Shaanxi Provincial Disaster Relief Association, respectfully, Jian Yin. (2) The Xinwei Relief Association, the Bin County Magistrate and the Disaster Relief Branch reported that in the Maigou Niushanbao Anlebao and other places in the third district on the afternoon of July 2nd, hailstones suddenly fell, about two o'clock, as large as bricks and as small as chicken eggs, and the autumn seedlings were completely damaged. A elderly woman walking along the road in Maikou was struck and killed by hail. The disaster victims were wailing and desperately hoped for relief. We sincerely request that you provide relief. We have investigated that the county previously reported that the second district suffered hail damage on June 19th, and we have forwarded the request for relief. Now, according to the report on the disaster in the third district, we respectfully forward the telegram again, hoping for your compassion and overall relief. Shaanxi Provincial Disaster Relief Association, respectfully, Jian Yin.</p>
<h3 id="e185">The Audit Group of the Flood Relief Association Thoroughly Investigates the Dispute over Disaster Relief Affairs in Northern Anhui <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Gongquan, the director of the audit group of the National Government Flood Relief Committee, and accountant Pan Xulun have always been serious about auditing the accounts of disaster relief funds and goods in various districts. Therefore, audit sub-offices have been established in the central locations of various disaster areas to exercise audit powers nearby and audit the accounts of various agencies under the committee at any time. When the dispute over disaster relief affairs in northern Anhui occurred, he immediately telegraphed Wang Xiaoxiang, the manager of the Bengbu Bank of China, who also served as the director of the Bengbu audit sub-office of the group, to supervise his staff to exercise their powers in a practical manner within the scope of audit duties in order to re-establish disaster relief funds. It has been reported that the Bengbu sub-office has replied, stating that although Commissioner Quan Shaowu sent staff to various disaster areas when distributing disaster relief funds, they did not make widespread contact with local people, which led to misunderstandings. The truth is now clear. The remaining 40,000 yuan in disaster relief funds has also been allocated to various counties by the Northern Anhui Flood Disaster Committee, and they have been notified to come and collect it immediately, so the matter can be concluded as soon as possible. As for the official and voluntary disaster relief funds and goods in northern Anhui, the date and quantity of their receipt, dispatch, and transportation should be announced in detail. Additional personnel are currently being sent to the Huai District Transportation Department to jointly clear the accounts of the relief goods. Once the investigation is complete, it will also be announced in detail and a report of the account check will be prepared and sent to the committee for review.</p>

<p>The Zhabei Charity Group, under the orders of the Social Bureau, is providing relief to the impoverished people in the war zone by operating a congee factory in the Xinyingpan Congee Factory on Liuying Road. Starting on the 2nd of this month, congee is distributed every morning from 5:30 AM to 7:00 AM. In addition to those impoverished people who have already registered and received coupons at the group, general impoverished people can go to the congee factory on Liuying Road to receive congee by presenting a pawn. The Social Bureau has also sent staff to the factory to supervise and inspect, and the director of the group, Wang Binyan, is also supervising everything. The number of impoverished people receiving congee has been issued for the fourth day since the factory opened. On the 5th, the number of impoverished women and children had increased to 1,600 to 1,700. It was feared that the number would continue to increase. It has been heard that the Social Bureau has temporarily allocated 3,000 yuan for the expenses of operating the congee factory, but it is feared that this will not be enough. More than 2,300 people have registered and received coupons from the group, most of whom are extremely poor women and children. Since the distribution of congee began, the impoverished people have benefited greatly.</p>

However, according to the investigation, on May 16th, the Japanese Navy did not arrest six church members of the association, and there are currently no people being detained. If there is other evidence that can prove that the church members were arrested on that day, please find a way to submit it so that it can be investigated. This order is issued on July 30th of the 21st year of the Republic of China.</p>

<p>▲ Labor-Management Disputes Affect Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery Four Goods Factory Federation previously stated that labor-management disputes in various industries were emerging one after another. Workers often relied on their numbers to make demands, causing the competent authorities to fail to handle mediation effectively in accordance with the law. In the end, the disputes became entangled and worsened day by day, which affected industry and was by no means a trivial matter. On July 25th, a temporary meeting of member representatives was convened to discuss relief measures. The representatives unanimously decided to ask the government to effectively impose sanctions in accordance with the law to maintain industry and to hope that the government would quickly take the following measures: (1) Strive to stop labor strikes; (2) Order the country to sell national goods; (3) Appropriately support factories in difficulty; (4) Quickly raise large sums of money to provide relief to the unemployed. Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Hancheng, Pan Xusheng, Zhu Wenqi, Zhang Zilian, Yan Qingxiang, Yu Xueyang, Yang Ying, and others were immediately elected as petition representatives. At 10:00 AM yesterday (the 5th), the representatives went to the Municipal Government with their documents to petition the mayor. However, the mayor was out on official business and was not able to meet them. Chief Shen met them on his behalf and discussed everything in person, and promised to convey their intentions to the mayor. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>

<p>Due to a factory closure issue, a dispute arose at the San You Industrial Company's main factory in Yinxiang Port, Hudong. The authorities intervened several times, and the factory temporarily maintained the workers' meals, and the labor side was notified to await resolution. Now, because the factory has been short-paying for meals, yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, except for a small portion remaining in the factory, approximately 700 workers, wearing white cloth signs reading "San You Industrial Company Workers' Petition Group," went to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition. Due to the large number of people, they spread throughout the bureau's courtyard, auditorium, and stairs. The workers were quite orderly, and the bureau police did not interfere. Representatives Qin Changgeng and others were selected to request a response from the bureau. Initially, the bureau stated that the case was under review and did not require a response. The workers indicated that they would not leave. Subsequently, Wang Xianqing from the Third Section of the bureau met with them and responded to the workers, saying that the bureau had hired accountant Pan Xulun to audit the historical accounts of the San You Industrial Company's main factory. Accountant Pan had completed the audit of all accounts, and the city party headquarters, the municipal government, and the bureau were dispatching personnel to discuss solutions. A practical solution would be determined within two weeks. The factory's shortfall in meal expenses could be notified by the bureau to be paid in full according to the original amount. The workers were also instructed that for future matters, representatives could be sent to negotiate, rather than the entire group coming to the bureau, to avoid causing misunderstandings. The workers listened to the response, deemed it satisfactory, and then left.</p>

<p>Cooperative rice seedling planting, also known as public rice seedling planting, is an organization formed by farmers working together. It is not only convenient for pest control but also saves economic and labor resources. It is extremely important for improving rice cultivation. However, as this is an innovative initiative, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry has compiled a general overview of cooperative rice seedling planting and selected the Shanghai Yu Tang Township Model Agricultural Extension Area to hold a demonstration for farmers to emulate. The Provincial First Agricultural Experiment Field Songjiang Branch was instructed to send personnel to work with the area's instructor, Zhang Weibin, to provide guidance before the planting season this year. Following the regulations in the overview of cooperative rice seedling planting, village heads and deputies from nearby villages were convened to discuss implementation. A total of five cooperative rice seedling planting areas were established, with 17 participating farmers, including Chen Ziyu and others. The rice seedling field area was 17.3 mu, with varieties including Quyü and four others. The seed quantity was 23 shi and 8 dou. The seed soaking period was from April 30th to May 4th, the sowing period was from May 4th to 9th, the number of egg collections was two to four times, the number of moth traps was three to six times, and the transplanting date was from May 20th to June 1st. The results were good. The details have been reported to the Department of Industry for record. Yesterday, the department instructed the field to continue promoting it to benefit people's livelihoods.</p>

<p>▲Wife About to Give Birth, Utterly Penniless</p>
<p>▲Father Unsympathetic, Taking All Savings</p>
<p>▲Yu Guihua Pawned Clothes to Buy Opium</p>
<p>▲Departing the World of Suffering</p>
<p>Yu Guihua, a Zhenjiang native who previously ran a paper box workshop on Zhoujiazui Road in Hongkou, was 26 years old. After his business failed and the paper box workshop closed, he moved to live upstairs in the Zhenhua Wine Shop on Dongyouheng Road. Although he repeatedly asked people to find him a job, he was unsuccessful, leading to extreme financial hardship. Yu then instructed his wife to work as a female worker at the nearby Changxin Tobacco Company, relying on her meager daily income to make ends meet. Recently, his wife became pregnant and was about to give birth. To maintain their daily lives, she had to go to the factory to work every day. The factory owner, seeing her plight, gave Yu's wife five yuan as expenses for childbirth. However, after several days of household expenses, only one yuan and eight jiao remained. The day before yesterday afternoon, Yu Guihua's father, Changgen, came from Zhabei to his son's place to ask for pocket money. His son told him about their financial difficulties, but his father did not believe him. Guihua then gave him one yuan and said that he had eight jiao left and needed to keep it for household expenses. His father refused and then took another six jiao. Changgen still ignored him. In the end, Guihua gave his father all one yuan and eight jiao, which finally resolved the matter. After Changgen left, Guihua's resentment grew. He pawned his only cloth robe, bought opium, and returned home. After his wife fell asleep, he secretly swallowed it and committed suicide. When his wife discovered it at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, he was already unconscious. She urgently arranged for a car to take him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, he had taken the poison for too long and died on the way.</p>

<p>▲Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Mediation for Next Monday</p>
<p>All workers at the Pudong Tian Zhang Paper Mill branch went on strike due to unsuccessful demands for wage increases. The City Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhang Sheng, Zhu Gui, and Lin to the factory the day before yesterday to persuade the workers to resume work first. The wage increase issue would be mediated according to the law. The workers immediately convened a meeting and decided to accept the proposal. Therefore, starting yesterday morning, they resumed work as usual. However, the labor side requested that the capital side pay wages as usual during the strike period. The capital side issued a notice yesterday denying this, causing extreme dissatisfaction among the workers. They have already reported to the Social Affairs Bureau to request attention. The Social Affairs Bureau has scheduled a meeting for next Monday to convene both parties for mediation.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Association telegraphed Beijing: Nanjing, respectfully presented to Shao, President of the Legislative Yuan of the National Government, Wang, Premier of the Executive Yuan, Song, Minister of Finance, Chen Junjian, Minister of Industry. According to reports, starting today, the Ministry of Finance plans to increase the import tax on artificial silk raw materials to 73 gold units. According to the value, this exceeds 100% of the value. However, imported artificial silk products are only taxed at 60% of the value. This inverted weighting places the national silk weaving industry in a desperate situation. On behalf of the industry in both provinces, we urgently telegraphically appeal to your esteemed leaders to consider carefully and revise the tax to be levied on imported finished products in order to conform to the principle of protection.

<h3 id="e196">Li Zhong Lane Responsibility Issue for Indian Policeman's Killing <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The case of an Indian policeman committing murder and stabbing a tenant in Li Zhong Lane, Yuezhou Road, on the 2nd of this month has attracted considerable attention from all sectors. However, there are various rumors and disagreements regarding the nature of the housing and the employment of the Indian policeman. The following is a record of the statement from the He Xing Real Estate Company, the owner of Li Zhong Lane, regarding this case: (1) The entire real estate of Li Zhong Lane is mortgaged to the China Business Company for 126,000 taels of silver. The contract stipulates that the rent will be used as interest. The right to collect rent and hire gatekeepers rests with the China Business Company. (2) Tenants are in arrears of a large amount of rent, averaging eight or nine months per household, which is a fact. However, the rent arrears are unrelated to the Indian policeman incident, as the court handles issues such as rent arrears and evictions, and the bailiffs execute them.

<h3 id="e197">Reaction to the British American Tobacco Factory's Promulgation of Management Rules <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>▲Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union Holds Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the British American Tobacco Factory in Pudong suddenly promulgated 23 management rules on the 1st of last month, the workers believe that the implementation of these harsh rules has made the workers in the factory unable to laugh or cry, and their actions are restricted at every step. The most severe of these include the fact that workers are not allowed to take leave, and the factory can arbitrarily dismiss workers. This has caused a unanimous and violent reaction. The Fifth District Cigarette Industry Union believes that the rules promulgated by the factory not only favor the interests of the capital side but also contradict the conditions of labor-capital cooperation and the factory's existing customs. If strict resistance is not taken, the workers' inherent rights will be completely exploited by the factory. Therefore, at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, an emergency representative assembly was convened to discuss countermeasures. More than 100 representatives attended. Zhong Quan, representative of the City Party Headquarters, and Tan Peiyan, representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, attended to provide guidance. The presidium of Gu Ruofeng, Fei Keguang, and Pan Quanrong was elected, and Sun Xiaozhu recorded the meeting. After the meeting began as scheduled, the harsh rules promulgated by the factory were discussed. All representatives believed that since the government has promulgated factory regulations, they should be fully implemented. Now, the factory adopts the factory regulations that are beneficial to the factory and incorporates them into the management rules. It only favors the interests of the capital side. Furthermore, after carefully reading the articles, they found that they contradicted the labor-capital cooperation contract signed in the 17th year of the Republic and the existing customs. The factory is intentionally disrupting the regulations and destroying the conditions. It was decided: (1) to submit a request to a higher level to promptly revise the rules; (2) in the name of the representative assembly, to notify the factory that the management rules should be suspended until the higher level has revised them; otherwise, the factory will be responsible for any accidents that occur. There was also detailed discussion on the factory's refusal to allow workers to take leave and the deduction of rice subsidies. The meeting did not adjourn until late at 10:00 PM.</p>

<p>Li Jinsheng, a robber from Yangzhou, was charged with robbing the Huayang Printing House at 824 Wuchang Road of 520 yuan, 9 jiao, and 6 fen, and a silver watch at midnight on May 31st, with accomplices. The neighbors He Ji Clothing Store apprentice Zhou Wenhua saw them fleeing and chased after them, blowing the alarm. The nearby Hua police officer number 3072 heard the alarm and rushed to the scene. The robber Li dared to open fire to resist arrest, penetrating the police officer's uniform. Fortunately, it did not penetrate the flesh. The officer then returned fire, shooting Li in the leg, causing him to fall to the ground. He was immediately searched and 106 yuan, 7 jiao, and a silver watch were confiscated. He was detained and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. He denied opening fire to resist arrest and was ordered to be detained for further investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Bingrong held a continued trial. The police lawyer stated that in the adjournment period, the bullet casings found at the scene had been verified and matched the bullets from the handgun seized from the defendant. The handgun and bullets were presented for inspection. Hua police officer 3072 testified that the defendant fired three shots, breaking his uniform and holster, and was lucky not to have been hit. The defendant confessed that a certain Li who was on the run had proposed that they go rob, but the shots fired at the time were fired into the sky to warn off pursuers and he did not dare to shoot at the police. He pleaded for leniency. Judge Shen, after appointing a pro bono lawyer to defend the defendant in court, ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<p>▲Child Trafficking Case Cracked on Qiongzhou Ship</p>
<p>Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association, inspected the Xiamen-bound Qiongzhou ship docked at the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession at 11:30 yesterday morning. They saw a middle-aged woman in the steerage cabin carrying two boys, one large and one small, whose behavior was suspicious. They questioned her in detail. The woman claimed that her surname was Lu Lin, she was 38 years old, a local, and the two children were her own. She said they were going to Hong Kong, etc. When asked for the names of her two children, she was speechless. When the two children were questioned, Chen and others thought, "How can a mother not know her own children's names?" Clearly, there was something else going on. The woman, seeing that she had been exposed, claimed that the two children had been sold to her by a friend. The older child was five years old, sold for 75 yuan, and she had already paid 15 yuan. The younger child was two years old, sold for 40 yuan, and she had already paid 10 yuan. She said that after she went to Hong Kong and returned, she would pay the rest. The two investigators became even more suspicious upon hearing this and questioned them separately. The woman finally revealed the truth, claiming that an unknown Wuxi woman had entrusted her to take the two children to Xiamen to sell. The older child could be sold for 200 yuan, and the younger child could be sold for 150 yuan, etc. Chen and others, seeing that the case was clear, took the three of them to the customs water police station. After the police chief clarified the situation, he deemed that the woman was trafficking children for export, separating families, which was a heinous crime. He sent detectives Huang Songsheng, along with the two investigators Chen and Lin, to send them to the local court for sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Child Trafficking Case Cracked in a Chongqing Hotel <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>▲Three Trafficked Boys and Girls Detained</p>
<p>The Xinzha Police Station received an anonymous report the day before yesterday from a Zhou, stating that child traffickers were hiding in the Chongqing Hotel on Chongqing Road. The police chief instructed Hua Detective Li Shizhong and Detective Ma Zhongrong to investigate at 11:45 AM. After confirming that this was the case, they detained the traffickers Wang Gensheng (also known as Wang Ada) from Changshu, Chen Yongcai from Shanshi, and the women Fan Chen and Wang Chen (Wang Gensheng's concubine) in rooms 8 and 9. They also rescued the trafficked boys Liu Dexiao, 13, Fan Ayou, 5, and the girl Mei Xiuying, 8. They were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. First, police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that he was accusing the defendants of violating Article 257 of the Criminal Law, obstructing marriage and family, and presented the details of the case, requesting an adjournment. Then, the 13-year-old boy Liu Dexiao testified that he was from Jiangyin, his mother had died, and only his father remained in his hometown. He came to Shanghai with a fellow villager ten days ago and got lost on the way. Because he was alone, he stayed in the alleys at night and joined the beggars at the bridges during the day, helping them pull carts. A few days ago, the defendant Wang Gensheng took him to the hotel, etc. Wang Gensheng confessed that Mei Xiuying was brought by Zhang Gensheng and he spent 25 yuan to buy her as his adopted daughter. He found Liu Dexiao with the beggars, rescued him, and took him to the hotel, preparing to take him back to the countryside and have him farm. He was not selling him. Chen Yongcai testified that the 5-year-old boy Fan Ayou was bought from the countryside by Yang Zhiquan, who brought him to the hotel and asked him to take care of him. Fan Chen testified that she was in Shanshi and recently received a letter from Chen Yongcai, so she came to Shanghai to help take care of the children at the hotel. Wang Chen testified that she had recently become acquainted with Wang Gensheng and did not know about the trafficked children. After Judge Ge Cixun verified the confessions, he ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody separately for another hearing in seven days. The three children were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute and the Women and Children Relief Association for care.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Huaiyin Lane Property Dispute Case, Original Plaintiff's Appeal Rejected <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Wang Qinglin, the owner of Huaiyin Lane on Zhejiang Road in the British Concession, mortgaged the property to the China Land Reclamation Bank for 150,000 taels of silver last year. His cousin Wang Xichang learned of this and filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court, demanding an analysis because the property deed's household name was Wang Bingji, which was originally co-owned by his grandfather Bingchun and Qinglin's father Bingkun. The first instance ruled against the plaintiff, and Xichang appealed to the Second High Court Branch. Judge Hu Yigu summoned the appellant, who presented his appeal, stating that the current photo of the deed had been changed to Wang Bingkun's household name, which was forged. The signature on the distribution agreement in the 25th year of Guangxu did not match his father's signature on the consent form. The original judgment also recognized that Huaiyin Lane was not the Hu family's residence and was not subject to the distribution agreement, etc. Judge Hu then asked the appellant if he was an adopted son, when his father died, and if he had ever received a share of the rent from the Huaiyin Lane houses. The appellant replied that he was an adopted son, his father died in the first year of the Republic, and he had never received a share of the rent from Huaiyin Lane. The respondent's agent, lawyer Zhu Xiyun, replied that the deed's household name was Wang Bingkun, which was the respondent's father's name, and the original deed could be checked. The original signature on the case matched the distribution agreement. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department had certified that Huaiyin Lane was not formerly known as the Hu family's residence. As for starting to inherit property, it had been 75 years. Furthermore, the appellant's grandfather and the respondent's father had already divided the inheritance in the 7th year of Xianfeng. If the property was not included in the distribution, why did the appellant's father not claim co-ownership when he received 5,000 yuan in the 25th year of Guangxu? The appellant was already an adult when his father died. Why did he only claim rights 21 years later? The statute of limitations had long expired. The appellant was being used by others to claim co-ownership, and the purpose was extortion. The appeal should be rejected. The closing arguments were immediately declared. The appellant's agent, lawyer Mei Hezhang, filed a motion, citing Article 201 of the Code of Civil Procedure, requesting the court to reopen the arguments, stating that there was new evidence that had not been presented. He said that the appellant had suffered three nervous breakdowns since the interrogation and had attempted suicide. Could a settlement be continued? Judge Hu opened a hearing a few days ago to ask if the two parties had conducted a settlement. Lawyer Zhu Xiyun replied that the appellant was being foolishly used by others to attempt to divide the property, making it difficult to reach a settlement. Judge Hu then instructed the appellant's wife that the customs of Shanghai society had recently been poor, and some people often sow discord, provoke litigation, and profit from it. Unwise people are often fooled without realizing it. The appeal in this case was unreasonable. Therefore, the motion to reopen the arguments was denied, and the appellant's appeal was rejected in court.</p>

<p>On August 2nd, the Rice Merchants Association received a letter from a named Civil Federation, with a "Formosa News" paper dated August 1st attached. The paper contained a section that claimed there was a corrupt merchant in the rice industry, stating that Shu Zhanyuan, the manager of Rintai San Rice Firm, and Rintai Company, Santai, Kaitai, Jitaishan, and other rice firms, sold enemy goods rice. After receiving the letter, the association, with the anti-Japanese movement being intensified, believed that such a record should be strictly investigated. It immediately publicly elected two standing committee members, Shi and Zhang, to go to the rice firms for detailed investigations. At the same time, it received a letter from Shu Zhanyuan, the manager of the rice firms, with a "Formosa News" paper attached, requesting a detailed investigation to clarify the facts. Shi and Zhang went to various rice firms such as Rintai Company and Kaitai Santai to conduct detailed investigations of various account books and found no evidence of selling rice from Japanese merchants. They then went to Rintai San Rice Firm, which was related to the rice firms, and repeatedly checked the account books, also finding no facts as reported. They reported back to the association after completing the investigation. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a full executive committee meeting was convened to discuss the matter. Executive committee members Lu Wenshao, Shi Hongxun, Zhang Nianyi, Qu Zhenhua, Wang Weiquan, Zhang Heming, Lu Guishan, Huang Gengbo, representative Xu Zhenyue, and more than ten others attended. First, Shi and Zhang reported on their detailed investigations of Rintai Company, Santai Kaitai, and other rice firms, stating that the firms had no transactions with Japanese merchants or sales of rice. The account books of Rintai San Rice Firm, which was related to the rice firms, were also repeatedly checked, and there were no facts as reported. They asked for discussion. Next, Shu Zhanyuan, the manager of the rice firms, was also present and claimed that the "Formosa News" reported that he, Shu Zhanyuan, the manager of Rintai and other rice firms, sold rice from Japanese merchants, which was completely baseless. If there were such facts, he would accept extremely severe punishment. If there were no such facts, the report damaged his reputation. In addition to directly contacting the newspaper to negotiate, he asked for justice. It was decided that the association would publish a cover advertisement in various newspapers to prove that the rice firms did not sell rice from Japanese merchants and to notify all sectors to avoid misunderstandings. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>▲Kidnapping Victims Sent to Women and Children Relief Association for Care</p>
<p>The Second Branch of the Tangwan Public Security Bureau in the county learned that Song Liufa, a villager from Huangjiayan, Liu Dao Township, was hiding bandits and a kidnapped four-year-old boy of unknown name. Director Zhao led the police to rescue the kidnapping victim and arrested Song Liufa and his wife Song He, and sent them to the Shanghai County Government. The Public Security Section immediately proposed a research inquiry. According to Song Liufa, the boy was kidnapped and hidden by his friend Fu Lou on behalf of his teacher Fang Xiangsheng (Zhou Yusheng). He also said that his teacher lived in the Zhoujiaqiao area of ​​the city. The section then ordered the staff to hold documents and cooperate with the Sixth District Police Station of the City Public Security Bureau to arrest Fang Xiangsheng, namely Zhou Yusheng, and bring him to the case. After the section opened the court for interrogation, Zhou Yusheng denied hiding him. The section presented the interrogation situation to Yan County Mayor for approval. However, the truth would be difficult to determine without arresting Fu Lou, who was still at large. In addition to ordering police detectives to arrest and solve the case, the section has yesterday transferred the three people, Song Liufa, Song Yushi, and Zhou Yusheng, to the local court for interrogation, and sent the boy to the Women and Children Relief Association for care, searching for relatives to claim them, and to complete the flesh and blood.</p>

<p>▲ Compiling a National Gazetteer of Provincial Industries</p>
<p>Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo, due to the lack of systematic reports and materials on the industrial situation of various provinces in the country that could be relied upon, specifically drafted a plan to compile a national industrial gazetteer. He instructed the Bureau of International Trade to take charge of the matter. The director of the bureau, He Bingxian, has been actively proceeding with the plan in recent days. Zhu Xinong and Ruan Jing have been appointed as the chief and deputy editors, respectively, and Hou Houpei as the director of investigation. Other personnel have also been appointed and have begun their work, starting with an investigation of Jiangsu. According to sources within the bureau, the goal of this investigation is solely to promote industry and develop trade. The materials collected will be provided as a reference for industrialists and entrepreneurs. Our country has a great abundance of fine industrial raw materials and various products, but due to a lack of understanding of the true situation, they cannot be utilized. As a result, the treasures bestowed by nature are left unused, while daily necessities are supplied by foreigners. The annual leakage of wealth amounts to tens of millions, which is due to the weakness of domestic industries and the opportunity seized by foreign goods. The key to developing resources and promoting industry lies in having a full understanding of the industrial situation in various regions. Only then can one follow the map and design development plans. The importance of this work is evident, especially at a time when promoting national goods is being advocated. It is even more important to understand the situation of domestically produced goods. It has now been decided that, in addition to Jiangsu, provinces such as Zhejiang should also be actively investigated. It is estimated that Jiangsu province can be completed within four months. The bureau's appointed investigators, numbering over ten, will soon set off in different directions to conduct on-site investigations in various counties.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Questioning Mr. Xu Jiqing's Article (Respectfully Addressed to Those Who Doubt the Abolition of Taels and the Adoption of the Yuan) by Li·Xi·Yuan· <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Recently, various sectors have expressed their opinions on the issue of abolishing taels and adopting the yuan, gathering wisdom and benefiting widely, which is a great event. Yesterday, Mr. Xu Jiqing published an article entitled "(Respectfully Addressed to Those Who Doubt the Abolition of Taels and the Adoption of the Yuan)," explaining the four prerequisite issues advocated by various sectors recently, enlightening and inspiring, with painstaking efforts. However, I am not talented and still have many points in Mr. Xu's statement that I cannot understand. I will briefly state my humble opinions, hoping that Mr. Xu can further educate me.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding how to stipulate the legal tender value, Mr. Xu said, "For each silver yuan, the standard should be the pure silver it contains, and then add the actual minting cost based on the amount of pure silver, which will be the future legal tender value," etc. If this refers specifically to the new silver coins minted in the future, my ideal is naturally like this, and it seems unnecessary for Mr. Xu to explain. If it refers to the silver coins currently circulating in various regions, there are more than twenty types, with varying amounts of pure silver and different minting costs. In that case, what should be used as the standard for setting the legal tender value, and how should it be stipulated? Mr. Xu has not explained any of this, which shows that it is necessary to gather all parties and deliberate calmly before the event, and that the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan cannot be carried out rashly. (2) Regarding the issue of issuance reserves, Mr. Xu cited the Bank of China as an example, believing that the issuance of banknotes by the Bank of China, etc., has already been implemented publicly and there is no need to doubt it. However, based on the facts, I feel that Mr. Xu's statement is slightly inconsistent with logic. The so-called "taels" in the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan refer to various silver taels throughout the country, not just the standard yuan. Even if the banks in Shanghai alone can achieve public issuance with sufficient reserves, how should the issuance of banknotes in various localities be managed and supervised after the abolition of silver taels throughout the country? Mr. Xu did not mention how to prepare for this in advance. To generalize from one corner to the whole country seems arbitrary. Moreover, the issuance system discussed by people at the time refers to national banks. Currently, there are no fewer than dozens of domestic and foreign banks with the right to issue banknotes in the country. How can one Bank of China represent the whole? Even taking the Bank of China as an example, according to its 20th-year report, the amount of issuance reached 190 million, while Mr. Xu's so-called public inspection only covers 90 million in the Shanghai warehouse. The remaining 100 million issued by branches in the north and south have not been made public. To use a part to represent the whole, how is that possible? It is said that Mr. Xu is one of the directors of the Bank of China, perhaps intending to plan a further step at this time to seek full public issuance? This is what I am optimistic about. Furthermore, regarding the 90 million that Mr. Xu claims is currently public, 40% is guaranteed as reserve. After the September 18th Incident last year, it was suddenly announced that all of it would be replaced, and all domestic bonds were replaced with Japanese and American bonds, and title deeds, etc. Considering the meaning of complete independence of issuance, where were these securities withdrawn from, and where were they exchanged? If it is said that they were bought and sold on the market, then why is there no news of such a large transaction among foreigners, and what kind of reserves were used to compensate for the losses incurred? All of this is what outsiders are eager to understand and should be generously announced by those who advocate publicity. Furthermore, the issuance amounts of various private banks in our country are unlimited, which is criticized by commentators. Taking the Bank of China as an example, with a capital of 25 million yuan, although official shares account for one-fifth, it is essentially a private joint-stock company, not established by the whole people or the state. The current issuance of banknotes exceeds eight times the capital, which cannot be said to be a malformed issuance system in our country. At this time, the wise men's advocacy of abolishing taels must first be thoroughly rectified and reformed, which seems to be insightful. Mr. Xu, who is as knowledgeable as you, should also have the same feeling. (3) Mr. Xu said, "Banknotes should be based on convertibility. How can soft currency be issued without hard currency as a reserve?" etc. Regardless of the distinction between convertible and non-convertible banknotes in monetary theory, it is also difficult to explain based on the situation in our country. Are Fengchao and Jinchao not banknotes? Why can't they be converted? Are Pingchao and Hanchao not banknotes? Why should they be recovered with public bonds worth only 20% of their value? What I am worried about is precisely this. (4) Mr. Xu said that the suspension of convertibility of Pinghan was a temporary chaotic order. Even if an evil government were to change, regardless of whether taels are abolished or yuan are adopted, there is a possibility of recurrence at any time, which has nothing to do with the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, etc. According to commentators, after the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, the quantity of banknotes will inevitably expand, and circulation will inevitably become wider. If the issuance system is not fundamentally rectified in advance, once misfortune occurs and the same mistakes are repeated, the disaster will be a hundred or a thousand times greater than that of the former Pinghan, which can be asserted. Who says it has nothing to do with the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan? (5) Regarding the concentration of cash by the Wuhan government in the past, I also cannot help but doubt it. Even under the so-called "chaotic order" by Mr. Xu at that time, why could the banknotes with the Hankou imprints of Siming, Zhongnan, Xingye, Guangdong, and other banks still be fully converted in Hankou, while the Hankou banknotes of the Bank of China were only recovered at a discount of 20%, and then they colluded with the government to exchange them for long-term, low-interest public bonds, and then changed the banknotes issued in Hankou to those with the Shanghai imprint, and fully used them. This kind of issuing system with a changed face must be thoroughly reformed before the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, so as to avoid one mistake leading to another. This is almost a certain fact, and Mr. Xu is wise, and I think he thinks so too. Furthermore, I cannot help but say that recently, a few financiers and scholars have been vigorously guaranteeing that the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan will have a hundred benefits and not a single drawback, and that it can be implemented immediately. The situation is very similar to that of vigorously guaranteeing the credit of domestic debt a year ago and inducing people to invest. Recalling that at that time, a few bankers and scholars repeatedly promoted how reliable the domestic debt fund was, how sufficient the tax revenue was, and how strict the supervision of various groups was, writing articles and publishing pamphlets, on the one hand, they indulged the government's expansion of domestic debt issuance, and on the other hand, they aroused the people's interest in investment. When the time changed, a few bankers, who got the news first, sold off one after another, and then issued the argument that domestic debt was unbearable, telling people that the guarantee reserves for their domestic debt had been withdrawn and replaced with foreign securities such as Japanese, British, and American securities, and title deeds, etc., complacent. However, tens of millions of domestic debt holders have filled the ditches and cannot extricate themselves. Learning from the past and being cautious for the future, I cannot help but be suspicious and fearful of those who are now arguing and defending the immediate abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan. Mr. Xu has been advocating the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan for fifteen years. He must have tasted all the hardships in this process. Why could it not be realized slowly in the past, and why can it be implemented immediately today? What is the progress between now and then? My foolishness is what I have not understood, and I deeply hope that Mr. Xu can enlighten me.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Wang Geng Sentenced to Imprisonment <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>During the Shanghai War, Wang Geng, the former independent brigade commander of the 88th Division, left his post without permission and entered the enemy's key area. He was detained by the Japanese army and released after negotiations. The military headquarters and military law department organized a high-level military law review and thorough investigation. It was confirmed that there was no suspicion or evidence of communication with the enemy, and he was sentenced to only two years and six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>The new criminal law now imitates Europe and the United States, focusing on evidence, which is not bad. However, in China, before all investigation agencies and detective techniques have been established, whether it is applicable to focus solely on evidence is a question. Moreover, Wang Geng's case was during a military period, and whether it is applicable to ordinary criminal procedures is also a question. For the time being, I will not discuss this. Since the authorities have organized a high-level military law review, reviewed it several times, and thoroughly investigated it, they believe that there is no suspicion or evidence of communication with the enemy, but I say that evidence may be absent, but if you say there is no suspicion, then I dare not believe it.</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army fought against the enemy for more than a month. The center of the war was in Jiangwan, Baziqiao, and Yunzaobang. After Wang Geng was captured by the enemy, the Japanese army suddenly changed its battle plan and focused on the Liuhong area, which led to a sudden change in the situation of our army. This is suspicious point one.</p>
<p>Wang Geng, as a military commander, ran into the enemy's key area for no reason when the war situation between the two armies was serious, which not only damaged the dignity of our army, but also lost his personal character. What was the purpose of Wang's trip? This is suspicious point two.</p>
<p>Wang Geng was detained by the enemy, and the enemy must have regarded him as a rare commodity and would not let him go easily. Try reading the enemy's war pictorials. Wang Geng's head was drooping and his face was lost when he was severely questioned at the enemy headquarters. Everyone who saw it thought it was a great shame. Why was he released immediately after negotiations? The enemy kept Wang's confession strictly confidential and did not announce it. What method will our side use to investigate? Then, was our military situation leaked? This is another suspicious point three.</p>

<p>The ancients said that poverty is not the source of illness, but poverty is often adjacent to illness. When illness comes, you can still find medicine, but when poverty comes, there is nowhere to find gold and silver. Knowing that you should be cautious about illness so that there is no illness, but unwilling to be content with poverty, you become more and more poor. I am not afraid of poverty, but only afraid of illness. I only ask that the illness subside and I will be an immortal.</p>

<h3 id="e237">A Brief Discussion on Enamel Products <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>There are many enamel products, such as washbasins, enamel signs, and cooking pots, all made of enamel. The inventor of enamel was probably Hiokling of England in 1799. However, the cloisonné produced in Peiping, China, was invented as early as the Ming Dynasty, and it really has the same meaning. However, no one used to study and improve it, so it was only used in artworks. However, the base of enamel is made of iron, while the base of cloisonné is made of copper or silver. This is a different characteristic. The method of making enamel is to first make an iron base or a base made of zinc and alloy. However, it cannot contain lead because lead is toxic. If it is made into food utensils, it will be terrible. After the base is made, then apply the enamel solution. This enamel solution is usually divided into two layers. The solution applied to the first layer has a very high melting point, and the attached layer is not uniform and dense, becoming a porous substance. Because the metal of the base has the physical property of expanding when heated and contracting when cooled, it must leave room for expansion and contraction, so it must have pores. The second layer can use a compound that is easier to melt. Its properties are similar to the glaze on porcelain. Now I will briefly list an example of the raw materials and mixing methods used in the two layers.</p>
<p>(1) The first layer of enamel solution. This layer is related to the adhesion of the enamel to the base, so it is very important. The raw materials used must be compatible with the metal of the base. The size of the pores must also match the expansion and contraction degree of the metal used. Usually, twelve parts of silica powder, half a part of borax, and six parts of fluorite are used. After melting the above compounds, add a small amount of ammonium carbonate, alum, and other products.</p>
<p>(2) The second layer of enamel. This layer is related to the color and beauty of the product, so it cannot be ignored. The raw materials commonly used for mixing are 32 parts of feldspar, 22 parts of borax, 7 parts of quartz, 15 parts of Stonnous onide, 8 parts of sodium carbonate, 36 parts of fluorite, and 225 parts of N t e. Then add various pigments to be used. However, pigments are mostly metal compounds, such as Onide of lead, Antinoky inide, and Eobalt Silicate, etc., which are not easily soluble directly, so a mordant must be added. Borax silicate, etc., have the function of mordant.</p>
<p>Now that we know the raw materials and mixing methods of enamel, we have a rough idea. Now let's briefly talk about the working methods. The first part is making the base, which is mostly made by another factory. The enamel factory only does the enamel coating project. The coating project is to first crush the raw materials and melt them separately in a crucible to turn them into a molten solution. Then dip the base in it and stir it evenly. The procedure is not very complicated. The difficult part is whether the proportion of the mixture and the raw materials used are appropriate. Finally, I will introduce a common method for testing the quality of enamel. This method is to first soak the enamel product in boiling water for a few minutes, and then put it in ice for a few minutes. Repeat this two or three times, or several times. If there are no cracks on the surface, it is good. Otherwise, it is bad. If you want to know whether there is lead in the base of the product, you can use an egg, break it, mix the yolk and white evenly, and pour it into the enamel container. Let it stand for a day and a night. If there is lead, it will be found to be black, because there is sulfur in the egg yolk.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Contribution on Children's Toys <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Cang Ping</p>
<p>Because I am a young man who has just left childhood, regarding the suggestions for children's toys, I have come up with such a self-righteous contribution based on my own association, for everyone's discussion.</p>
<p>Each child has his own personality. Parents should first understand the child's personality, and then give him toys, which will be more interesting and more beneficial to his intellect. Therefore, children's toys do not have to be fixed on a large scale to be considered beneficial toys.</p>
<p>According to the child's psychology, most children are active, but there are also children who are not active due to congenital deficiencies and monotonous environments. Then, giving active children those large-scale toys will inevitably turn into barbaric activity. The child's physique and bones have not yet fully developed. If they are allowed to be barbaric all their lives, it will not be good for their health. I think the most appropriate compromise is:</p>
<p>For active children, in addition to dynamic toys, give them some static toys. The so-called static toys, such as small sketching boxes, small literary works, small colored picture cards, and similar interesting reading materials for children. It is best to have a small studio in the family, and all the numbers in the study should be manufactured according to the child's physique and psychology, so that the child can rest in this small study when he is not exercising, read books at will, and happily write sketches. In this way, it is really a way to integrate education into games.</p>
<p>For children who are not active, mostly because of physical weakness or monotonous environment, they cannot raise the interest in moving. Parents should try to introduce several neighboring children to the children, buy some sweets to maintain the relationship between the children, and buy a ball to arouse the children's enthusiasm. In this way, those who are not active will naturally become active. If the family is wider, it is best to open up a small garden and provide small hoes and small iron shovels for the children to plant some flowers and plants themselves, and for the children to raise some creatures themselves. Tame dogs and cats are all excellent toys for children, and in addition to playing, they can also learn about the evolution of nature and the healthy virtue of caring for creatures... These are my contributions, and I hope that my colleagues will correct me.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Reply to Mr. Cheng Peng's (Social Improvement Discussion Association) Feng·Heng· <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Peng does not approve of wearing a student uniform on the upper body and shorts on the lower body. He thinks</p>
<p>(A) It is not as beautiful as a suit because it looks like a servant.</p>
<p>(B) Suits can be made of fabric and can also be economical and not aristocratic.</p>
<p>My opinion is that it looks ugly, but it is only because it is not common. As for those who laugh at people as servants, they are fundamentally rude themselves; and that person's vision is narrow, which can also be seen.</p>
<p>If it can be implemented uniformly, then it will be the same as foreigners wearing suits. What's so funny? Wearing shorts is certainly cooler. If there is a more comfortable way, not implementing it would be foolish, right? The British also wear shorts. I wonder what Mr. Cheng Peng thinks? Do you say it's not beautiful? That's too much attention to decoration. Do you say it's not dignified? They also wear shorts to pay homage to the emperor, or maybe they are barbarians and have no dignity?</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng said that European and American workers and peasants all wear suits, which I also know, but it is the same as Chinese workers and peasants wearing Chinese short shirts and trousers. They have their customs and habits, which are fundamentally different from ours. If we wear suits, we must follow their etiquette and customs, but I am still Chinese! Otherwise, what should I do?</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng said that suits are economical, but please inquire about the price of handwork. With two sets of cloth suits, although you can avoid being a servant, you still can't see people, because cloth suits will change shape after wearing them for a day or two and must be ironed. Most people don't know how to iron, so... To be done once and for all, and to want to see people, you must use fine呢 or嗶嘰,羽紗.</p>
<p>If there is a social gathering, then formal wear is a must, otherwise foreigners will shake their heads when they see it.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>In short, I think it is not difficult to wear short shirts and trousers normally. If we set another kind of formal wear, then we can be less angry with foreigners, and it is not difficult to implement.</p>
<p>As for the layer of women's thighs, I think if the weather is too cold, they certainly can't wear stockings, so don't worry about that. As for being detrimental to public morals, those who have lascivious thoughts will not be strange if they see more. If they unfortunately die young, then they are also self-inflicted, like those who throw themselves into the Huangpu River and don't need help. (In response)</p>
<p>Seeking Trouble</p>
<h3 id="e240">Miss C's Clever Plan <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Since the slogan of (Freedom of Love) was brought from Western countries to China, the general Chinese people, who have always held the view that men and women should be isolated and never interact with each other until old age, have suddenly changed their concepts; and at the same time, slogans such as (Public Socializing) (Equality between Men and Women) have also gradually spread throughout China. And young people, after reaching a certain age, regard the pursuit of the opposite sex as an urgent task.</p>
<p>However, under the current situation, although the voice of public socializing is spreading everywhere, it is not difficult for men with flexible social skills to find girlfriends, but it is indeed a difficult problem for those with inflexible social skills to find a girlfriend. Under this situation, the general young people with unstable blood, in order to not find friends of the opposite sex, sometimes rack their brains and try to woo women they do not know, which is really extraordinarily pitiful! Asking friends for women's names, seeing women's names in newspapers, and even going to the gatekeepers of girls' schools to copy a few girls' names. When they return to school, they send letters regardless of the consequences. If one letter is not answered, they send two letters. If two letters are not answered, they send three letters... They send them endlessly. It doesn't come to a complete stop until they feel that they have no more interest.</p>
<p>Miss C, she studies at a certain girls' school. Recently, she has also received three love letters in a row. The person who wrote the letter has never even met her, let alone know her name. From this point, we can prove that the reason why he knows Miss C's name is either from a friend or from a newspaper, or perhaps he copied it from the gatekeeper of a certain girls' school.</p>
<p>Miss C is a very mischievous woman. When she received the first letter from the unknown man, she did not reply to him. The second letter was also not replied to. It was not until the third letter that she came up with a clever plan and wrote a reply, inviting him to meet at two o'clock in the afternoon on Sunday at the intersection of Wing On and Sincere, under the iron platform where the red-headed Sikh is directing traffic, for a talk. She also explained that she was wearing a light red cheongsam.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon arrived. Miss C invited two female friends. After eating, they walked to the main road, stood on the corner of Wing On Company, and looked at the iron platform, but none of the three of them were wearing light red cheongsams. When it was almost two o'clock, a young man in a suit walked excitedly to the iron platform, looking around, as if looking for someone.</p>
<p>He looked for a long time on the sidewalks on both sides of the intersection, but could not find a girl wearing a light red cheongsam. Although there were occasionally women wearing red clothes mixed in among the pedestrians, they did not stop and went their own way, obviously not having any appointments. Finally, in hope, he slowly began to feel disappointed.</p>
<p>He was really anxious to death!</p>
<p>In fact, the person who invited him was on the corner, but he didn't know her. It made them laugh secretly when they saw him in this situation. Later, they walked away, but he didn't leave and was still hoping she would come. But even if he waited until tomorrow, she would not come. He had changed into a new suit for nothing and came to the road to bask in the sun. This is also a kind of reward for those who write blind love letters, right?</p>

<h3 id="e241">Cui Jie's Suicide <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>I had a quiet and virtuous cousin. When she was a young lady, her parents truly treasured her like their heart and lungs. Later, she married into a gentry family in the same hometown as a daughter-in-law. Her husband treated her very well, but she had too many young brothers and sisters-in-law. In ordinary days, with many people and mouths, it was not easy</p>
<p>to live. The mother-in-law always protected her children. Even if the daughter-in-law was right, she sometimes had to swallow her anger and put on a smiling face. She had already lived a very wronged life. But fate is coincidental, and misfortunes never come singly. At this time, a gossipy neighbor woman told her that her husband had a mistress in Shanghai and had already forgotten about her. This was originally a joke, but unexpectedly, these few words stirred up a huge wave in her troubled heart. From that day on, her attitude changed drastically. She stayed in her room all day, with no energy at all. Her mother found out and quickly brought her back to live with them. But her nerves had been struck, and she had already begun to suffer from mental illness. When she saw no one around, she would always kneel on the ground and pray, or secretly go to the kitchen to hide the knife. When the family discovered that the kitchen knife was missing, everyone panicked for a while and searched her body and room. Alas... she had already had thoughts of suicide.</p>
<p>One day, her aunt came, and the family naturally had to entertain her well. In the evening, we played mahjong until ten o'clock, and my aunt ordered the old servant woman to accompany her upstairs to sleep. Unexpectedly, at about one o'clock, our front door was knocked as loudly as a continuous drumbeat, making the four of us</p>
<p>jump straight up from our seats. Then there was even more banging…banging…banging…My uncle told the male servant to open the door. Who knew that as soon as the door was opened, a group of bums and hooligans swarmed in, jostling to be first, while shouting, "Your young lady has committed suicide by drowning herself in the West Gate River! Hurry and send someone to identify and claim the body!" ("She's about to die! Should we carry her back?")</p>
<p>When my uncle heard everyone's words, he was so angry that his beard stood on end. He said angrily, "Shut up! Don't talk nonsense! My young lady is sleeping soundly in bed. You must be seeing ghosts!" After saying that, he slammed the door shut. Half an hour later, there was another burst of frantic knocking on the gate, and the noise outside was deafening. Ah! Were they here to report the news again? My aunt was half-doubtful and half-believing at this time, so she quickly moved her lotus steps and went upstairs to see what was going on. As soon as she walked into her daughter's room, she was stunned. It turned out that the bed was empty. She searched under the bed, in the wardrobe, in the corners of the wall, but couldn't even find half a shadow. Only then was she sure that the one who drowned herself must be her A-Cui. She ran downstairs, her face as pale as a ghost, collapsed into a chair, and ordered the people to bring the female corpse back. They heard these words as if they had received a holy decree and left in a gust of wind. In less than a quarter of an hour, the stiff and cold Cui Jie had already appeared before our eyes. Then, the family's wailing and the hooligans' and bums' extortion mixed together into a single sound. Alas... she destroyed herself like this, leaving behind her only three-year-old biological daughter to rely on her frail and elderly grandmother to live her life.</p>
<p>When her husband received this tragic news, he rushed back overnight. He caressed her corpse and wailed loudly, unable to speak through his sobs. Relatives and friends all blamed him, but pitifully, he had no way to defend himself.</p>
