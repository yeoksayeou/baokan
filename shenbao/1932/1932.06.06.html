<p>時評</p>
<h3>有計劃的國家與無計劃的國家</h3>
<p>計劃爲行動之基礎無行動之計劃爲空談無計劃之行動則爲力的浪費惟有計劃之行動始能順利進行亦惟有計劃之行動始能收穫良好之結果其在個人如是其在一國更無不如是</p>
<p>一國之政治千頭萬緒在無計畫之狀態下自爲混亂爲無組織惟其無計劃故惑則爲精神與物質之浪費或則爲個人之營私舞弊百病滋生末由步上正軌其在生産事業計劃尤爲重要在無計劃狀態下之生産結果必成爲浪費其所損失殆無可估量</p>
<p>美國爲今日資本主義國家中最繁榮之國然而吾人試一檢視美國於物力之浪費斷非吾人所能預料者</p>
<p>如一九二零年萬千西瓜被投入波脫馬克河萬千加侖之牛乳被傾伊里諾斯之江流一九二一年中央及西南各州之大道上佈告勸農民焚燒五榖以代煤炭然而在另一方面則千萬飢寒交迫之失業羣衆躑躅街頭欲求一衣一飽而不可得至於近年來之不景氣更使人爲之咋舌如美國股份之種類共有千三百餘種其股份之總額本年三月一日計算達十三萬萬股以時價合算爲二百七十六萬萬金元但與去年三月一日之數宇相比僅及半數如與一九二九年九月一日之數字相比祇及三分之一弱不足三年竟損失達六百萬萬金元之鉅又如去年美國農家之總收額爲六十九萬萬二千萬金元較之一九二九年减少至五十萬萬金元由於政府對於全國生産與分配無通盤之計劃於是始則各個自由競爭繼之生産過剩工廠停閉失業羣衆日增終乃不景氣日益苦悶竟至不可挽救之悲境是則此種無計劃之生産與浪費不僅爲一幕悲劇實即爲一種罪惡爲瘋狂之舉動不僅此也即如世界各國强大之軍備殘酷之戰爭亦無一不爲浪費此種浪費之爲無可補償之損失更極顯然然而在無計劃之狀態下此種浪費此種不景氣又恰爲事所必然</p>
<p>抑吾人此處之所謂計劃非僅指某一事物而言其尤要者爲就整個國家整個社會作通盤之打算美國之産業界何嘗各個無周詳之計劃特其所計劃者僅爲各個之利益而非大衆之福利美國如是一般資本主義之國家無不如是故吾人若徒就某種事物之本體而計劃即使有成而其最後仍必歸入罪惡之途</p>
<p>蘇聯在革命之初其混亂與窮困爲盡人皆知但自五年計畫確定按步進行遂能在目前震撼全世界之不景氣之狂潮中仍一步一步走入繁榮之前途此無他則以其有整個之計畫而計畫又爲適合大衆之要求爲大衆謀福利之故</p>
<p>我國目前一切都凌亂支離間或有所謂計劃事實上又長期被擱置在案頭永未見其進行實現如最近實業部之四年計畫如江蘇省建設廳之三年計畫雖在我國行政上已爲鳳毛麟角然而國家無整個之計畫其一部一廳必有整個之設計使其配合而後機器之運動乃靈活進行乃順利全國政治必有通盤之計畫作有系統之推進而後一切乃能井然有序不至徒勞亦不至使百弊滋生</p>
<p>故吾人切盼我國能成爲有整個計畫之國家而此計劃又爲就大多數人民之福利作通盤之打算同時更希望此種計畫不徒爲空談而集中全國精力逐步促其實現</p>

<h3>齋藤發表對滿新政策</h3>
<p>對滿洲僞國决先承認獨立</p>
<p>仍高唱門户開放哄騙列國</p>
<p>如不獲諒解不惜退出國聯</p>
<p>華聯社五日東京電　齋藤首相昨日發表其對滿新政策九項其内容爲（一）日本之對滿政策如國聯不能同意堅持反對日本日本對國聯將决行脫退亦在所不辭（二）日本對中東鐵路俄國所有之權益毫無侵犯之野心（三）滿洲國如能獨立雖列國不承認日本亦必率先承認之（四）日本對滿洲依然遵守門户開放機會均等之原則（五）九國條約有不合時勢之點如各國有意改訂日本甚願參加以副新局面之需要其他尙有四項均屬對俄政策從略</p>
<p>日聯社五日東京電　美國聯合社駐東</p>
<p>京記者巴布氏向齋藤首相兼外相提出關於日本外交政策之質問書齋藤四日以文書答其九項問題茲將其内容詳誌如下</p>
<p>問　日本退出國聯說如何</p>
<p>答　如有日本退出國聯之事不能謂日本所進路程不正但余希望此種事情之不發生</p>
<p>問　外傳日俄戰爭勃發之危險如何日本有無與俄訂立不侵條約之意俄國所有中東路之事實對於日本在北滿之權益構成威脅乎</p>
<p>答　日本政府最近迭次聲明决無日俄戰爭險之事俄政府對於滿洲各種案件之態度又得完全正鵠日政府希望俄政府停止集中軍隊於遠東國境不侵條約成立之結果使非戰公約之力削弱且對於未與日本訂立不侵條約諸國與以惡影響茲條約之締結不外於去年以來屢次討論之設定特殊親善關係故於確定本問題之前預先愼重考慮本問題所附帶之一切事情爲要蘇俄政府對於中東路事有之權益並無侵害日本經濟的權益</p>
<p>問　貴政府以買收中東路等方法取得</p>
<p>俄國權益之事對於日本有利益乎恢復滿洲和平有無掌握該路軍事的管理權之必要</p>
<p>答　以上述之理由日本取得他國在中東路之任何權益之事决不能謂日本之利益</p>
<p>問　日本承認滿洲國乎有無併吞之意或利用滿洲國多數日本人顧問支配滿洲國諸政策之意貴政府將派比現在更多之軍隊赴滿否貴感如何</p>
<p>答　　承認滿洲國問題俟新國家自立之能力證實後或依據關於承認新國家之普通條件如何始能决定鑒於日滿地位之接近及滿洲生死之權益關係不得不設定本問題日本决無併吞滿洲野心之事固不待言又不欲如任何非合法的手段支配滿洲當局之政策日本僅望在滿洲國治下之領域内自國權益之充足而已至應否增派軍隊赴滿之事根基今後情勢如何而定如國聯諒解中國政府對於滿洲地方之要求决非實質的者且現代中國政情不安定之結果清洲土匪猖獗異常此種事實如能絶根則該方面之軍事行動即可結束</p>
<p>問　貴政府對於維持滿洲對一切國家通</p>
<p>商之門户開放政策有無贊成之意貴改商府有無考慮日滿關稅同盟或其他經濟合作之問題</p>
<p>答　日政府對於一切國家始終維持滿洲門户開放機會均等之原則不必重言日滿關稅同盟或其他經濟合作等問題爲夢想不到之事</p>
<p>問　日本政府有無考慮保軍規之嚴正及防止再發生如五月十五日直接行動之辦法日本有無右翼或反動派變革之危險</p>
<p>答　軍規問題由陸軍大臣極力維寺「右翼或反動派」之意義爲何余不能信所謂變革之發生能增加任何人物之政治權力所謂法西斯運動之意味如何余未能諒解如問者之意旨謂政黨政治不能代表國民輿論之說則余信各政黨領袖互相協力施行善政以滿足國民希望之</p>
<p>外無抑制此說方法</p>
<p>問　貴政府對於廢止九國條約或改訂四國條約問題有無贊成意</p>
<p>答　如他簽字國希望改訂本兩項條約則日本决無不望協力之事然中國現變遷無常難保該條約有屢次加以修改之必要</p>
<p>問　歐美輿論以爲日本關於滿滬兩案已失正當新内閣對此感想如何貴政府擬實行何種政策以改善日本與西洋諸國之關係</p>
<p>答新内閣信歐美輿論之大部分有力者不能完全觀察滬滿兩案之情勢結果反對日本行動尤其多數者以爲有正當組織國家受日本侵犯之問題彼等未知中國對於日本鐵路及陸戰隊之暴行且斷定滿洲爲中國政府統治領土之一部此種見解確缺正確且非必然的者隨着各國漸次諒解日立塲日本與他國關係必定轉好日本應實行之政策遵守公約維持門户開放機會均等之原則及打破阻害現存國貿易之關稅碍害以求</p>
<p>世界經濟之恢復</p>
<p>第九項質問關於菲律賓獨立問題茲從略</p>
<p>電通社五日東京電　齋藤首相因滿洲四頭政治統轄事已命有關係之各官廳在調查中另命山岡關東長官及内田滿鐵總裁進京商議故山岡長富將於此數日中進京内田總裁亦於十二三左右抵東京在内田總裁抵京前齋藤首相將暫决定草擬之案待與内田總裁會見後一面懇請渠就外相之任一面求渠協力於滿洲商題在任命内田就外相時滿洲問題似將急速具體化</p>
<h3>赫里歐新内閣</h3>
<p>法國輿論表示滿意</p>
<p>國民社四日巴黎電　昨夜法國赫里歐所組新内閣備受今日巴黎各報之歡迎僅極端右派各報連秩序報在内表示公然反對新政府意其餘右派較温和各報則似咸有靜待今後事態發展再加批評之趨向他如著名傾向保守派之現象報則對於任彭古爲陸長表示顯著之滿意巴黎日報亦一保守派報紙聲稱新閣員大多數皆才智超絶其能勝任愉快可無疑也至左派各報當然熱烈歡迎但對於新閣職責之異常艱鉅亦不無畏懼意共和報稱此時内外局勢充滿不祥之可能性前閣鑄成種種錯誤新閣乃承受不良之遺産云云說者以爲此次反對黨報紙大多數對新閣具妥協態度者蓋因洛桑會議開幕在即不願爲難政府云</p>
<p>哈瓦斯四日巴黎電　法前總理泰狄歐今日下午在外交部與赫里歐辦理移交明日赫氏將召集閣員規定各人職權並斟酌新内閣宣言中之各要點</p>

<h3>智利不流血革命成功</h3>
<p>經濟不安定爲導火線</p>
<p>革軍兩小時内佔都城</p>
<p>總統孟德魯被迫下野</p>
<p>達維拉攝行元首職權</p>
<p>社會主義政府告成立</p>
<p>國民社五日智利京城電　智利陸軍及空軍今日突然叛變此次倡議革命之領袖爲智利前駐華盛頓大使達維拉氏達氏要求智利總統孟德魯氏立即引咎辭職孟德魯爲保守黨人去歲十月四日當選總統當時選舉情形甚爲紊亂並有暴動發生曾因此死者十人傷者百餘人今日革命勃發後孟氏初尙堅拒不肯辭職叛黨即以哀的美敦書送致孟氏時限僅兩小時聲言若兩小時内革軍不得總統之辭書立即採取强制行動自哀的美敦書送遞後各處召集之革軍約二千五百人即向京城桑地雅谷進發聲稱將誓死作戰建立社會主義之共和國孟德魯氏旋即爲軟化退出總統官邸而革軍首領達維拉氏立即遷入總统官邸攝行元首職務並宣布社會主義政府之成立於是智利之革遂未經流血而告成</p>
<p>功查此次革命形勢雖至急驟然其間醖釀爲時實已久遠其最大之原因不外乎世界經濟之不振使智利出口减少國家收入不敷不得不厲行减政致公務員薪資亦不能如數發放去歲八月十九日復不得已而宣布停付外債以維持國内之準備金額去年春季總統伊班納茲氏任内國會曾以迪克推多之威權加諸總統伊班納茲遂頒布緊急命令一百五十道之多其中如檢查新聞等條例尤爲引起反響之導綫七月九日内閣倒後繼任内閣數日復倒第三次内閣則存在僅一日以學生之暴動而去職第四内閣成立後以高壓手段加諸學生國立大學之學生被政府以武力驅逐時有二學生死焉於時全國憤激羣情洶洶伊班納茲遂不得不將政權交付參議院議長萊脫利爾氏己則微服出走萊氏不久亦即以應付爲難推舉孟德魯氏爲内閣總理兼攝總統孟氏後即乘國内擾亂之際而取得實授總統之位但未幾海軍以减餉三成故發生譁雖立即平息曾將譁弦變者二千七百人拘交軍事法庭審判但嗣後内政及經濟方面糾紛迭起迄未寗息此雖皆已往之事實爲最近叛變之導火綫</p>

<h3>德國政局前瞻</h3>
<p>國社黨表示將緩和政策</p>
<p>準備與保守派密切合作</p>
<p>法報對巴本内閣好感</p>
<p>國民社四日柏林電　今晨德國國家主義派報紙對於解散國會皆表示歡欣視爲樹立内政新政策之先聲謂此種新政策將與白魯寗及前此歷屆内閣所秉政策截然大異且料將來總選舉結果國家社會黨定可大勝甚或可在新國會占絶對多數議席即或不然亦可與其他國家主義政黨共掌政權該黨黨魁希特勒昨在美克倫堡選舉演說聲稱國家社會黨準備與保守派政黨共組聯合内閣此語極可重視如天主敎工會機關報德意志報甚至聲稱希特勒與現政府閣員間已有切實諒解雙方在選舉後將密切合作希氏並表示將緩和該黨政策稍稍遏止黨員在政治仁經濟方面之急進主張該報並謂當雙方會晤時廢太子已在塲蓋廢太子準備在今後政治舞臺扮一重要角色云云但政界多不信此說</p>
<p>國民社五日柏林電　德内閣今日上午舉行閣議對於昨日大政方針中述及之若干新緊急命令作最後修正此項命令一部份即係白魯寗辭職前所草擬者此外或將包含撤銷國家社會黨挺進隊禁</p>
<p>令及修改目下過於嚴峻之報紙法令等</p>
<p>國民社四日巴黎電　法報對於德國新内閣態度竟出預料之外毫無敵視意一般主筆似已决定在新内閣發表大政方</p>
<p>針與有所措施以前暫不加以評斷此時各報則紛紛載稱德國新總理前爲法德委員會委員對於增進德法親善上曾頗努力且常來巴黎時與法國天主敎人士過從云</p>
<p>國民社四日柏林電　德國各報對於政府大政宣言論調不一自極端贊成至猛烈攻撃無所不有但有一點則主張多同以爲該宣言足　斬除内政上之糾結明示未來選舉戰之陣勢保守派報紙尤常持此種論調但此派報紙雖稱譽政府仍未免懷有恐其難達期望之憂懼農黨之德意志日報聲稱在近十二年多事之秋政策屢變但未嘗有如此明白與有力之昭示者此次可謂在内政與文化政策上急進之變化國家主義派之地方指導報則稱國權黨未負組閣責任將專就其政績加以判斷雖然新政府策固大半正</p>
<p>確無疑但未免帶有高調耳又謂宣言中對於内政外交上所欲爲者少所表示但有一端極可同意即際此時局必須予國民藉投票以决定今後國家政策應趨途徑之機會是也反對論調中則以天主敎工會機關之德意志報爲首力稱大政宣言祗足以表示新政府並非全國集中人材内閣其組織目的專爲進攻天主敎黨與社會黨而已嗣又痛駁宣言中所指天主敎黨奬勵傳播「文化過激主義」之語柏林日報抨撃尤烈謂大政宣言不啻對於共和德意志一切建設之宣戰書乃一純粹反動政策而已</p>

<p>預算收支可以相抵</p>
<p>路透社四日紐約電　據紐約晚郵報消息銀行街對於美政府所稱現已平衡預算之說表示疑念今日該報載有一文謂即使政費縮减三萬六千萬元如胡佛總統之要求但一九三三年預算案之支出仍須達四十萬萬元本年捐稅總收入殆不足二十萬萬元假定一九三三年</p>
<p>捐稅收入亦如此數另加以補充稅案所可得之十一萬一千九百萬元則收入總額仍不足三十一萬二千萬元與支出相較尙短少八萬八千萬元今籌撥巨欵爲公共救濟經費一舉似屬不可避名果爾則美國不得不於明年借債支持其數約在十五萬萬元與二十五萬萬元之間云英意與美</p>
<h3>簽訂繼續償債協定</h3>

<p>我國向來尊重敎師所以士農工商把敎師的職業放在第一位以爲敎師是有學問和道德的人應該受社會的推重敬仰其實這種謬語的敬重敎師的觀念那知道就輕輕地把敎師的責任减少了一大半因此敎師應有的功能也就不容易發揮了換句話說這種推重敎師明明是呌我們做敎師的只要在書本上用功夫學校裏做工作就是了其他的事情都不是我們做敎師的應該聞問的這種第一流清高的敎育界就把我們的民族整個弄成一個不死不活的模樣敎育者的潔身自好和敎育權利的給少數優季份子的佔有實在是這種差誤的重士視念所造成的現在我們曉得敎育就是生活學校就是社會敎育是要謀人們大衆的福利不是給少數人佔有的一種奢侈品所以敎師一定要和民衆接近學校一定要活用社會那末敎師的功能和敎育的效率才有發捕達到的一日照怎樣厘訂的敎育意義和價值那末敎師是社會國家所公有的應該受社會國家的特殊待遇所以我們應該說尊重敎師是爲了他是努力建設社會的勞工不應該　是爲了他有學問和道德要知道敎師有了學問道德不能爲社會國家應用的我們何必一定要推重他呢我想我們提倡敎師節誰都應該明白這層意義我們因爲敎師是建設社會國家的勞工所以他們配受社會國家的特殊待遇制定敎師節是爲了喚起社會上尊重敎師的地位和增加敎師的待遇但是同時也爲着要提配一般敎師們負起建設社會國家的責任來和任何勢力奮鬥民衆們給我們敎師的特殊待遇就是要我們爲民衆們努力建設這是提倡敎師節敎師們應該明白的第二義最後還有二層意思要敎師們共同努力工作的第一是師資問題我們爲了自身工作效率計進一步要希望政府積極的從速制定完整的師資培養機關師範敎育制度之支離破碎實在不是二奬勵敎師和重視敎育的辦法消極的設法澄清學校敎育工作人員把不以敎育爲終身職業的敎育員先生們加以嚴格的取締這確是敎師們應該自動起來努力工作的第二我們旣承認新敎育是謀大衆福利的敎育是爲社會國家建設的敎育那末育工作的永久性是敎育效率上最緊要的條件我們做敎育師</p>
<p>的當然應該要有穏固的地位但是一切敎育工作如敎育行政人員等何嘗不應該有穏固的地位呢最近數年來敎育行政人員的毫無保障隨時局而轉移何嘗不是使我們敎師們流離失所的主要原因因此敎師節也就是喚起重視敎育行政和保障敎育行政獨立的一種原動力所以我們希望政府積極的勵行敎育行政專業化以造成永久的敎育職業消極的剷除把持敎育行政以及藉敎育作政治作用之政客官僚這就是我們提倡敎師節應該明白的第三義至於敎師的待遇地位和修養問題那當然是提倡敎師節的重大目標因爲敎育同志中言之者已多故不贅</p>
<h3>我們爲甚麽要規定紀念節</h3>
<p>李步靑</p>
<p>我們要規定敎師紀念節並不是爲敎師張目實在是替國家打算這個節日含有國家新生命的意義現在提出三個理由來說</p>
<p>第一從敎師方面說　現今政治上的罪惡直接說是軍閥和政客造成的從根本上說都是曾經受過敎育的人們或者助討論爲虐或者置若罔聞纔有這樣現象這是歷來敎師們要負責任的要使各個敎師清責任加意修養立己立人不僅是改良待遇保障權利可以達到目的必使從整個社會裏明明白白表出一種衆意所屬的意義能使他們感覺責無旁貸纔不推諉並且使他們得到一種神秘的安慰纔加倍努力所以敎師紀念節的規定比那基督敎的禮拜日還要深切而有意義</p>
<p>第二從社會方面說　中國向來重士原來是以士爲有學問而且有品行的人自把士專當作取富貴的階梯於是士也不成爲士了可是於今變本加厲問不成爲士了勢除了官僚和現役軍人外富商大賈在社會占了最重要的地位近則工人和學生也能在組織團體方面取得優越勢力惟有敎師上不在天下不在田加入職工則因非勞力者而斥爲寄生蟲加入學生則時期已過斥爲老朽名爲優秀分子倘没有黨籍便失掉了領導資格幾乎在民衆方面没有獨立權利國人天天談社會改造把社會中心人物取消了立塲試想還成一個怎樣國家我們要改正錯誤便須採取原來重士的要錢纔可以恢復民族精神所以仿照勞工節規定敎師紀念日那麽社會觀念改變風氣自然轉移了</p>
<p>第三從政治方面說　賢人政治張有方的政府都成了過去名詞被野心政治家盡量假借利用業經没有存在的價值了我們今後所希望的是科學政府這個政府一切組織和設施是根據眞實事實構成正確理想凡大小官吏都建築在專門學術的身上也就是古來官師合一的遺意所謂學優則仕仕優則學是不能分成兩截的以往的訓政失敗原因全在不學無術犯了馬上得天下治之的流　知識階級簡直變成了御用品與其空爭憲政仍走虚僞民治的故道何如厲行敎化把政治和學術鎔爲一爐如果定敎師紀念節表示導師重學爲立國根本那麽由學術形成政治便可逐漸達到目的同進於大同世界</p>
<p>以上所說雖包括不了敎師紀念節的意義但是道三個理由爲國家打算實有從速規定紀念節的必要一一敎師們起來</p>
<h3>敎師節答客問</h3>
<p>盧冀野</p>
<p>「敎師奚爲而有節日也」</p>
<p>客有來問於余才時余方退課獨處室中倦甚聞其言矍然而語之曰</p>
<p>「五月一日非勞工節乎四月四日非兒童節乎三月十八日非婦女節乎勞工也兒童也婦女也各有節日以相慶祝我敎師又烏可無節日也</p>
<p>敎師之位於社會亦猶醫師與律師病者知就診於醫師訟者知問法於律師故醫師律師終其身守其職我敎師竭其力勞其心爲社會國家育材其功固不讓於醫師與律師也願一切人士體其心力鑒其忠誠安心托以子弟則當知今日敎師之所以爲敎師藉茲節日展其實况我敎師又烏可無節日也</p>
<p>俗諺謂敎曰坐冷板凳板凳之所以爲冷明知其爲冷械板凳而坐之此敎師之精神也如之何慰此坐冷板凳之敎師則社會國家之責矣社會國家果知是其責也則敎師亦必安心永坐而不懈敎師不懈則國家敎育無進步而國事隳廢者未之有矣願以節日布其願望我敎師又烏可無節日也」</p>
<p>余言未竟客奮然起張臂而和云</p>
<p>「我敎師又烏可無節日也」</p>
<p>客去筆之於書願我中國三十萬敎部同樂此六月六日之敎師節願我全世界四百萬敎師同樂此六月六日之敎師節且爲之歌曰</p>
<p>敎師節間接圖世界永久和平之解决</p>
<p>敎師節直接謀發揚光大敎育之事業</p>
<p>國家因之益强盛社會因之益純潔</p>
<p>凡我敎師勿忘此六日勿忘此六月</p>

<h3>古廟敲鐘錄（十）（四）不除庭草齋夫十六</h3>
<p>吃過大菜　我們回到吳公館閑談了一些時候吳大少便請我們到大世界去遊玩宋老太主張遊公園並說大世界這種地方鄉下人是去不得的我想爲什麽去不得這裏面必定有些奇怪我好容易進城第一次何能不</p>
<p>去見識見識宋老太說這話的目的無非是想阻止我們到大世界去好不知道這番話反而引起我的興奮使我非去不可春生哥心裏也有點癢宋老太終於被我們的軟求所屈服和我們一起去遊大世界這裏一切的一切我都是見所未見宋老太心裏總有些不滿特别是不滿意那些花公子和摩登小姐她是嘰哩咕嚕的見一個講一個把他們批評的體無完膚我雖不以她的態度爲然但從她的談話裏我實在學了一些不可多得的智識離我前面一丈路光景有一位小姐在散步我見好失落了一塊手巾在地上便喊說『那個的手巾掉了？』那位小姐正在回頭望我一望的時候只聽得後面一聲『鐘兒！』宋老太繼續的說說『那是野鷄！拆白黨！拆白黨！』你惹他做什麽？她是特爲摔掉手巾引你和好招呼我講這個壞地方鄉下人來不得若不是我在這裏保你們今天上好一個大當跟到她家廟去白銀子化光衣服給人剥掉駝一頓毒打抱着頭兒回到鄉下有人問起倒說是跌了一跤跌傷的對不對？』宋老太的話我有幾分懂我實在覺得難爲情我兩頰發紅我不得不爲自己辯護我說『我們鄉下人見了人家失落東西總是要告訴人的爲什麽城裏失落手巾的是野鷄告訴的人要駝打？』吳大少搶着說『他倒是好意』宋老太說『鐘兒是我們頂好的孩子我知道他是好意我說這些話只是警醒他要提防壞人總之這種地方鄉下人是來爲妙我的老腐敗的意見是</p>
<p>『大世界</p>
<p>小世界</p>
<p>七離八怪</p>
<p>不敎人好呌人壞』</p>
<p>我不能完全贊同宋老太的意見大世界裏却有好的東西特别引我注意的是那些鏡子把我變得像一個七十二　的孫悟空奇怪！這是什麽道理？我得問問先生我非把這個道理找出來不可</p>

<h3>海上盜匪猖獗</h3>

<p>海關專條巡輪於二日晨間在吳淞口外佘山燈塔附近海面因檢查沙船船照致與海盜發生激戰當塲被盜撃斃巡員四人重傷三人其情曾詳載前日本報茲悉該盜船本係福建民船係被盜所擄去者船主船夥當時均在船上有四人跳落海中駕小舟摇至佘山燈塔得救已於昨日由海關海星巡輪帶之來滬故探得該船被擄前後情形詳紀如下</p>
<p>民船往返烟台　福建人余第一（姓名）·余第二·余第三·余第四·弟兄四人在福建東冲地方開有余順興民船公司一所自置大民船一（並非沙船）船上設大帆三百行駛全賴風力並無摇櫓余第一故世多年公司事務由第三第四·兩人管理船名金風順由第二當事雇有船夥二十三人其營業情形係由東冲載貨駛往烟台再由烟台載貨返東如是往返每年兩次所載貨物則以磁器木料爲大宗而船夥工資極微除膳宿由船公司供給外每往返一次所得工資洋十元實際每年祇得工資二十元故其生活甚爲可憐</p>
<p>海盜上船强佔　本年陰曆三月十五日該船載貨駛至福建三沙海面迎頭忽有一沙船駛來余船夥主初不以爲意不料沙船駛近余船時忽躍出大帮盜匪各執長槍盒子砲等開放迫令余船停駛余等至此惟有束手就摛盜等乃悉數躍上余船而盜等所駕之船則任之漂流他去海盜爲數共四十四名武裝全備而所穿衣大都綢緞所製惟均穿短衣並無長服若輩操台州或黄巖口音性頗强横爲首者年約三十開外一至船上即迫令速備飯食余船本係長途行駛船上載有食米二十餘擔船夥等屈於淫威之下只得唯唯聽命</p>

<p>羣盜海上逍遥　余船自被擄後所處生活極堪發噱盜等在船上並不做事日以行駛海面逍遥爲樂事每日三餐則令船夥翁當心（即遇救來滬之一）擔任因盜數衆多每餐須煑飯二三次菜極缺少所有者祇船上所備之小鹹魚（福建人稱之爲魚生）盜等食畢所有殘餘則船夥等分食之然每食必不得一飽蓋盜等因船上所備食米有限日久恐有不濟故有意將船夥等膳食减少之而船夥又不得睡眠最可憐者則爲燒飯之翁當心盜等稍不快意即藉煑飯不佳爲名將槍柄向翁亂撃日必三四次無間斷翁呼寃無門惟有含滬忍受於此可見海盜强暴之一斑</p>
<p>擄架沙船船主　盜等自將余船擄刧後其第二次買賣係在寗波口外花腦北地方當時有一捕黄魚之寗波沙船正在工作之際盜等駕余船驟至有盜十二名各載長槍躍登魚船搜刦一過即將船主王玉蘭架上余船並令魚船船夥速即備欸六百元贖人言畢盜即揚帆逸去一面向王大肆恐嚇索欵甚急王以無此鉅欵對則鞭撻立至打畢迫令在船上帮同工作</p>
<p>此次激戰情形　國曆本月二日清晨盜等駕余船駛抵吳淞口外佘山洋面停泊至九時許忽遇海關專條巡輪派小輪至余船檢查船照盜爲先發制人計於是開槍轟撃巡輪方面死傷情形已詳前報而盜方則死二名受傷多人此時余船船夥乘雙方激戰之際紛紛躍入海中盜等竟放槍撃斃三人尙有船主余第二見良機不可再失亦乘間擬逃上海關小輪不料一殺那間即被盜撃斃死者屍身均抛棄海中盜以久戰不敵遂揚帆逸去</p>
<p>逃出者均獲救　當激戰時躍於海中者除被盜撃斃之三夥外尙有燒飯夫翁當心船夥連金法鄭茂勇·及第二次被擄之黄魚船主王玉蘭·等四人連鄭王三人同拉住余船後梢小舢舨之拖繩翁則臥於小舢舨内故均得慶更生盜逸後四人同摇小舢舨向佘山燈塔駛去其時四人飢腸轆轆不得已手捧海水吞壯充飢直至午後三時許方摇抵燈塔四人上岸後適管燈塔人與王玉蘭相識立即供給四人衣食當夜假宿塔上前日值海星巡輪駛至該塔乃將四人載之來滬臨行中燈塔人並贈王盤費三元翁等三人因遠在福建故各贈九元昨日上午海星輪抵滬後由海關水巡捕房派華探孫阿桂·薛嗣林將四人一併帶至捕房訊詰一過諭令暫留捕房迨今晨捕頭訊問後再定發落據翁等云盜等臨逸時船上所餘米已不滿兩餐而同船船夥尙有十五人因不及逃出亦被迫隨盜逸去云云查翁等四人除王係甬人外餘三人均福建人若輩取名甚爲離奇如船主余第二第弟兄四人竟以數目爲名而翁當心之人名亦屬罕聞</p>

<p>擺地灘的測字先生大笑道；「解决這問題，請來問我」！但見他，磨的墨濃，舔的筆飽，揩的粉牌光滑。但見他，筆在粉牌上書寫，口向衆人演講：</p>
<p>「做農人的，不是土頭土腦的阿土生麽？這個赤字，上半便是個土勃；所以農人做了領袖，其色赤。那個紅字，右一半不是工人的工字麽？所以工人做了領袖，其色紅。倉頡老子造字的時候，早知道赤先生们一定把土老兒做政治中心；紅神聖們一定把勞工做全國的模範人物，所以造這字，把土老兒做根據；造那紅字，以把勞工做根據。倉頡老子的眼光，遠不我也在測字攤旁，聽他的新字說，覺得又似有理，又似無理；正待要向他研究一下子。</p>
<p>他又把粉牌拭抹乾凈了，接受他人的字捲，没暇和我談天了！</p>
<h3>殺敵妙計</h3>
<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>一條年久失修破敗崎嶇的惠山路。向來使人有『建設局在幹什麽』的感想。近來。我們那苦守吳淞威震世界的一</p>
<p>百五十六旅官兵開到無錫以後。這條路就有了復興的機會。前天我到惠山去。看見這條路上。佈滿了該旅的官兵三四百人。一個個精神抖擻。手持鐵鋤。或抬着沙泥。在忙着修復這條路的缺陷。額上的汗。已一滴滴的落在沙土上。手廟還不停留地在動作。嘴裏面有的在談笑。有的在唱着廣東小調。啊。他們是多麽地忠勇。勤勞。外侮來了。立刻忘記了自己的生命。脚踏實地的去捍衛祖國。駐防的時候。也不虚耗國家的餉糈。當操練之餘。做些有利於人民的勞工。阿。眞是可敬可愛的人民的軍隊。要比起那些勇於内戰怯於禦外的禍國殃民的軍隊來。眞有天壤之别了。</p>
<p>我因爲被敬愛他們的心留住了一雙脚。先站着看他們工作後來竟和他們談起話來了他們中間。有一位姓唐的排長。</p>
<p>告訴我滬戰時他親身經歷過的一種殺敵妙計聽道後。使我佩服得五體投地。現在且把他的話記在下面。</p>
<p>自從一二八以後。我們在緊張的空氣中。人人都非常高興。高興的是殺敵的機會來了報國的時候到了。大家的生命。都在革命的火燄中活躍。抱着必勝之心。和倭宼拚命。有一次。大約是二月三四號的傍晚。我們一連人。在蕰藻浜附近。和敵人一小隊肉搏。雙方互有死傷。後來我們詐敗。有一部份同志僞裝中彈。倒臥在死屍一起。將死屍身上的血。塗在自己的面上或身上詐死。敵人以爲我們眞敗了。就乘勝追撃。當他們越過那堆死屍的時候。我們在假逃的隊伍。立刻集中。向後轉。猛烈反攻過去。敵人正待要回頭。那知那堆死屍中間殺聲震天。突然跳出幾十個滿面鮮血的人來。手裏拿刀的也有。拿手槍的也有。夾攻過來。截斷了他們的後路。於是這一小隊倭鬼。嚇得魂不附體。手慌脚亂。不多一會。都斷送在我們手裏。殺得他們没一個生還。眞是一件最痛快的事。</p>

<p>這見，我並不想多拖拉什麽，而單就那雖然已是古城而依然充滿人間味兒的北平的五月一說。</p>
<p>石榴花在庭宇裏張開了火一般的紅眼，天氣驟然地從温和的一變而爲灼熱的，並且灼熱的心裏都有點煩燥。尤其是</p>
<p>年輕的多血的男女們，他們將在苦悶的永晝裏，究著很單薄的衣衫，疎慵地無力地倒在床上，在心裏或肉體上都感著一種微妙的舒適，這舒適，要我說起來，那就是煩惱的首導線了。</p>
<p>在破舊的故都，一切的故都，一切的一切都顯示了衰落，但故都的敎育界却依然繁榮著，這眞不能不說是荒蕪的墳墓上的鮮花了，因爲了這，在故都的學生子是特别多，而居然也有人說：「故都是學生子把</p>
<p>他的生命延續了，飯店公寓没有了他們便將寥落而至於關門大吉的。」</p>
<p>多血的學生子，到了這定期的性的興奮期，他們自然將會不能忍持地作著肉的追求？這是很顯然的而且甚普通，在宮牆邊，在長安街上，在清寂的斷衕裏，以及在無論那一個角角裏，你總會看見年輕的女學生們，變著魚一樣的曲線，穿著肉感的有著强剌激性的旗袍，三三兩兩地帶講話帶走路，而在後邊，也會自然而然地跟上同等數目的男性，他們緊緊地釘著女人們的後麽，不倦地釘著釘著，　貓一樣的眼睛，挑逗情懷的言語，都表徵著他們性的需求的急不待</p>
<h3>廉儉救國說（三）</h3>
<p>— 聶曾紀芬述男其杰撰文</p>
<p>蓋時值萬壽。各省督撫紛紛在滬採辦各國奇巧之物。以爲貢品京内大臣則更逢迎意旨。請而影響如此其鉅。嘻。可畏矣。乃甲午戰敗後。國人不知警戒。不務節儉以厚蓄國力。其所謂變法興學者。專務揣摩歐風。而我國廉儉之美德。遂置腦後。社會奢侈。日甚一日。積數十年之漏巵</p>
<p>遂使强鄰之船益堅。砲日利。以爲侵略我之具。是誰之過歟。近十年來。奢侈程度。又數倍於昔日。步趨歐美陋習。無所不用其極。男女學生。多著西裝。襪履之價。至數十元。婚禮摹仿西式。自頂至踵。無一非舶來貴品。一蓋頭紗巾。價至數百元。結婚之場。以外國酒館爲上。總之一切舉動</p>
<p>。欲完全似外國人。尤欲似外國富人。而以中國之服飾狀態爲可賤可恥。此毒深入臟腑。愛國觀念無形消滅。欲保民族之獨立難矣。蓋國家的個性己亡也。中國立國的精神。與民族的個性。雖不一端。其特點實惟儉懲。中國政敎之根本在德禮。而德禮亦以儉爲歸。孔子答林放問禮之本。曰。禮與其奢也寗儉。御孫曰。儉德之共也。侈惡之大也。故儉爲中國政敎之精神也。蓋嗜利而以富驕人。爲人類同有之惡根性。世界禍罪皆由於此。惟我國古聖賢深知其故。故其爲政立敎。推</p>
<p>重禮義。而貶抑富豪。孔子言。君子喻義。小人喻利。孟子以孳孳爲利爲盜跖之徒。又述陽虎言。爲富不仁。爲仁不富。又以商賈壟斷市利。爲賤文夫。漢賈誼最錯爲中國大政治家。深斥富商大賈豪奢之行。妨害民生。敗壞風俗。淆亂禮制。言之痛切。以故數千年來。賴禮敎之維持。以社會清議之制裁。成爲無形之法律富豪貪官有所忌憚。有明之季。尙存此風規。官吏或致富歸鄉。類爲士林所不齒。此實中國特有之民族精神。降至今日。輸入歐風。尤以美國爲最。尊富人曰上等人。稱美豪奢。賤視儉素。學者且從而爲之說。風氣乃大壞而國事不可爲矣。</p>
<p>緩，而被釘的女學生們，有時也會瞥了他們一眼，或是清脆地，似是怒嗔而是撒嬌地駡一聲「缺德！」</p>
<h3>書劫</h3>
<p>— 俞劍華</p>
<p>此次滬變。文化損失。不可以數量計。其犖犖大者。如商務書館。東方圖書館。易培基藏書。劉士木周越然藏書。或海内孤籍或宋槧善本。或搜自外國。或得之南洋。文化命脈。所關匪細。而盡付祖龍一炬。誠可謂空前浩劫。愛國女學於去年移於江灣路塵園。花木幽勝。校舍清新。方冀蒸蒸日上。而此次亦被燬大半。校長委融五先生藏書全儲之圖書館中。雖未付丙丁。但已有甲無乙。凌亂無序矣。塵園主人鄧翥靑先生以江西共産黨仇視書籍。遂於去年七月間將南昌所藏舊籍數千卷運滬庋之園中。不意反被帝國主義所拉雜摧燒。今所餘者惟愚所借之詠物詩選半部耳。愚雖士。亦頗喜購求書籍。歷年所積。都數千卷。文學美術。書晝碑帖。古今中外。略備鱗爪。性無他嗜。撫摩翻閱。殊足以怡性悅情一二八事起。以僻處郊外。交通不便。聲息梗塞。越六日始倉皇出走。，風雪載途。妻哭子號。奔波終日。始抵租界。而身外無長物。以爲二十年心血。將不足供敵彈之一擲。及國聯調查團至。始偕寄凡宗兄御車往取。幾經周折。始達其地。幸室廬無恙。衣物俱存。大喜過望。而以充愛國女學敎員故。幾遭不測。若非寄凡諳日語者殆</p>

<p>却不料葉作章倒一下子竟被他朦住。立刻歛却嬉容。一本正經的向他回答。說是土匪宜撫不宜剿。民團也儘有極大的力量。我向來就如此主張。并定爲軍政最大方針之一。只可惜本地方人民僅知道扯開嘴咒駡我。全不肯說出好主意來指敎我和帮助我。殊不知都是本鄉本土的人。誰不想把地方治好。我一人能力有限。見識不多。又没有能人帮助和指敎。自然是辦得很糟。要挨駡一頓也還是没用。不如還是肯來帮助指敎的爲有益。等到我眞是不用賢能。不聽良言。再駡我也還不遲呀。你今旣有很好的辦法。我一定誠心誠意的歡迎。請你只管向我說。凡是可以行的。我若是不照辦。你以後就當面駡我是渾蛋。我也不怪你。安玉田聽了老葉這一段快人快語。不覺暗暗傾服。又是喜機緣不差。眞能夠遇見一個愛才明理的好主顧。便將平日在枕頭邊所編成的一套大謊話。什麽地方有多少人。人又有多少槍。他家世代又與這些人有什麽大淵源。如何就能一呼百諾的都來聽命。全胡吹了一大泡。談到臨了。葉作章慨然說道。好的。你眞有種。我們就準在一塊兒凑合罷。我一半天就出京。請你跟我一同回去。再細細討論一下大概就可决定那麽辦。現在暫委你一個軍事参議的名目。說過了就算數。只要你有人有槍。還愁没有你的好事幹嗎安玉田欠身謝過了栽培。葉作章忽又聳着肩膀低聲笑道。一言爲定。參議的公事。明天就呌秘書處辦好送給你却須一定跟我走。連家眷也順便帶了去。安玉田再答應是。這一席話便算告了結束。葉作章微微露出倦容。就轉移視線看到戲台上去了。原來台上這時已換了一齣玉堂春好戲登塲。那扮蘇三的花旦陳芳春。是老葉最賞識的人。當然不暇兼顧的要去專心領略。接着。又聽承啓官們連呌什麽魏總長到。張軍長到。小小一座包廂裏·陡又來了幾位官派十足的客人。</p>

<h3>顧維鈞赴日說</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>日政府一方面照會調查團，歡迎顧維鈞氏蒞日，一方面聲明陪員資格，實無干與發言之權，並非前往調查日本·前則爲融洽調查團感情起見，乘便歡迎顧氏，後則恐怕他人誤會顧氏前往日本調查，日政府對於國體與事實方面，雙方顧到，一絲一毫，不肯且，於此可見，</p>
<p>蓋調查團之任務，原以中國東省爲範圍，日本本不在調查之列，就此一端，即使日政府不先聲明，任何人亦决不致再起誤會，</p>
<p>惟顧維鈞氏在東省調查，尙完全爲人監視，一點不能自由行動，處處受人干涉，只得毫無塲面而返，現日方消息，謂顧維鈞氏昌言調查日本，實是越權暴言，我想顧氏怎敢說這樣的大話呢，不過顧維鈞氏，受日方如此毫無禮貌的敎訓，倘顧氏尙有此閒情逸致，欣然前往，則顧氏之寛大爲懷，仇恩並視的態度，殊令人景仰不置，</p>
<p>或曰顧氏此行，尙舍有其他的重要使命，是或然歟，</p>

<h3>假漆自製法</h3>
<p>— 乃徵</p>
<p>假漆，英文名（Varnish）·俗譯音作凡立水，係一種深褐色的液體，但亦有淡顔色的。塗在物體的表面上，則乾後變成有光澤的薄膜，非常美麗。</p>
<p>假漆之種類，大概可以分爲二種：（一）油假漆，（二）酒精假漆。油假漆的乾，因爲揮發性的深劑在空氣中蒸發，且受着氣化作用；牠比酒精假漆乾得慢。酒精假漆，是完全因蒸發而乾的，牠乾燥速度，雖比油假漆更快，然而乾後有龜裂片片落下之患；而油假漆則没有上述之弊。耐久之性甚富，光彩更加美麗。現在我選二個方法介紹在下面，這二個方子一個油假漆，一個是酒精假漆。</p>
<p>在未製造以前，先要備一些藥品與器具如下：琺瑯的小鍋一只，竹筷一雙，小口瓶一只，備儲藏假漆用。至於藥品，則可到西藥房或儀器館去購買一些，藥品名開列在下：可配兒（Copal）四英兩·舍來克（Shellac）十四英兩，阿剌伯樹膠（GumAradic）一英兩。酒精（Alcohol）一磅，那普太油十二英兩，因爲這是小試騐，所以置這一些已足夠，但是價錢倒不甚賤，上面的藥品，大約耍五元，現在把成分寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）漆家具假漆</p>
<p>舍來克（又名蟲膠片）十二英兩，可配兒三英兩，那普太油一夸脫半。（這些已足夠揩漆四只椅子一只檯子，所以起先試騐製造，尙可照比列改少成分）·</p>
<p>（二）美麗光澤假漆</p>
<p>阿剌伯樹膠一英兩，可配兒一英兩，舍來克二英兩。酒精一磅。</p>
<p>製法一先以可配兒撃散選去裏面包含的雜質，因爲我買過的裏面有植物質的東西，最好買純潔的·再拿舍來克一同磨細，使牠成粉末；然後以麻布篩過，再放入那普油中，一同置在琺瑯鍋中，下面稍爲在火上加熱，時時以竹筷拌掏，此時最須注意，即火之熱度，倘使太熱，則油質易變黑着火，熱度太低，則不容易深解，這是一些經騐之談，溶解後再用麻布濾過，製於瓶中儲藏起來。第二方子的製法亦弄清爽三種膠，再磨細之，放入酒精中，一同置在瓶中，拌掏一下，但不必在火上加熱，祇要密封瓶口，置在温處，等三天後，都溶解了，然後亦用麻布濾過，儲藏起來即可以用了。</p>
<p>上面第一個方子是上等假漆，漆在家具上非常光滑而美麗，第二個又可稱爲一種光澤漆，若再揩漆在已漆過假漆的器具上，則更能使增加光彩，使得非常艶美，所以各種雕刻美術品都用牠的。</p>
<p>不可思議</p>
<h3>不嫁他嫁誰？</h3>
<p>— 冷芒</p>
<p>被大家捧爲縣花的Miss葉，幾乎無時不在被一班靑年作爲談話的材料。</p>
<p>她的面孔怎麽好啊！她的舉動如何曼妙！總之，她的一切無一點不使一班靑年消魂，個個艶羨一個個墮其迷魂陣中，大凡是談到了Miss葉，便個個都是贊不絶口的，</p>
<p>假設你要問Miss葉是誰？他們簡直把牙齒都要笑掉，似乎說：連Miss葉都不知道，配做我們縣裏的靑年嗎？因此在這個縣城的靑年，没有不知道Miss葉的，</p>
<p>一班被顚倒着的靑年，發狂似的，都在鈎心鬥角的向Miss葉戲着媚，只要能得好的一顰一笑，便什麽都滿足了。還有一班結了婚的靑年，恐怕没有攫得Miss葉的資格，口口聲聲都着要離婚的高調。</p>
<p>可是Miss葉的身價，也被這班不花錢肯帮做廣告的靑年，一天一天高起來了，眞的一上至縣長，下至最愚笨的老面姓，無一個不知道Miss葉了。</p>
<p>因此該縣縣長，雖然有了老婆，便想到不能不趁這機會，享點艶福，而且當時有這樣較高的地位，着手自然較爲容易。</p>
<p>第一步便是請女子小學的校長做媒，因爲Miss葉是女子小學的學生，致於錢，更是不成問題，有的是地皮一只有一點兒因難，便是耍求得Miss葉的同意，於是縣長請了兩桌酒，第一位客，當然是女子小學的校長，其次便是Miss葉的尊長，和可以說到Miss葉的話的强有力者，</p>
<p>自然，受寵若驚的這班被縣長請吃飯的人物，那有不惟命是聽，照縣長的計劃去做，尤其是女子學校的校長，已得縣長這樣的抬舉，榮幸之餘，他更感到自己所負的使命極其重大。</p>
<p>果然有一天，Miss葉哭了，並說；「我不嫁丨我不嫁丨這老賊啊丨」這完全是校長的要求的反響，同時是許都人向Miss葉取着包圍的形勢，</p>
<p>『不要哭，德芳呀丨小孩子丨你要知道，他是我們縣裏的第一個大物，除了他丨縣長丨丨你不嫁他還嫁誰？我想丨丨雖然他老一點，有什麽關係？』校長這樣說；</p>
<p>同時許多人都和附着校長的話說，「眞的丨不嫁他嫁誰？」</p>
<p>可憐一個意志薄　的女孩子，雖然說着：「我不嫁他」結果還不是做了縣長的太太嗎？</p>
<p>但是，可憐了一班賣氣力的靑年，這時只是膛着他們酒杯大的眼睛丨說朋友一你着這「赤老」享福</p>

<h3>女間諜</h3>
<p>— 白檸</p>
<p>海上辦學校的手腕，眞是進步得一日萬里，使我們只有驚奇，贊嘆，五體投地，他們旣能熟察社會的形勢，又能揣摩學生的心理，知道在目前男學校是不容易辦的，因爲他們駕馭不易，一則容易滋事生非，於是就捨男而就女，</p>
<p>這一二年來，上海的女學校，眞可說如雨後春筍，街頭巷尾，女學校之招牌，决不有孫於南北雜貨烟紙店的，但是女學生的數目，决不能如女學校數目增加的迅速，於是又逃不出經濟學上「供過於求」的不幸的鐵律了，</p>
<p>但是，我們那班聰明睿知的辦學先生，决不會袖手無策，眉頭一皺，計上心來，他們看破了女子第一愛小便宜，第二就是喜歡見異思遷，</p>
<p>他們就佈起了個森羅大網，第一先物色幾位利口給舌，擅長交際的高足，用了幾句甜蜜蜜的好話，許了一點不大不小的好處，如此如此，這設這船，就堂而皇之，資送入××·××</p>
<p>，</p>
<p>這般欽差小姐，丨間諜女士丨領了御旨，踏進了學校，當然正目的不在讀書，一天到晚，喚姐呼妹，逡巡往來，大大地施展其交際手腕，結果，自有一</p>
<p>般不暗世事的小姐們，將他引爲莫逆，這時候，好就施展其第二步妙計盡力把學校攻撃得體無完膚，什麽設備不全啊，敎蹩脚啊，功課撤爛　啊，而這班無知無識的小姐們，也就一唱百和，結果，借了一點芝蔴綠荳船小事，</p>
<p>閙了一塲掀海揚波的風潮，</p>
<p>我們這般可憐的小姐們，當然也鼓</p>
<p>着一口浩然之氣，慷慨激昂，毅然離校，可是，離剿的小鳥兒，飛往那廟裏去呢？於是，就眼巴巴跟着這位間課諜女士，踏進了她們的宰牲塲，</p>
<p>辦學校的先生，眼巴巴從他大而且黑的眼鏡中，望着一班一班桃紅柳綠的小姐，帶着一卷卷五光十色的鈔票，源源而來，眞是「生意興隆通四海，財源利市逹三江，」不得不暗自喝采，好妙計也，</p>

<p>『不過以我個中人的觀察，她至少總有一種意思表示丨』</p>
<p>夜越深了一枝淡黄色臘燭火的光下，劉德光硬好了一封情，詞意略云；</p>

<p>『愛人丨我來了丨』</p>
<p>『················』</p>
<p>第二天的下午，舍監先生忽然把劉德光請去，冷言冷笑的遞給他一封信，他才瞥了一眼，霎時間臉色便紅一塊白一塊的浮現出來，兩目直眙，一聲不響丨</p>

<p>兩輛黄包車，載着兩位着海軍服，戴紅結帽的外國水兵，由我們的兩位貴同胞，飛快的拉過來，馬路當中，正有兩位我們的貴同胞立在那兒，看他們的神情，好像正想横穿過馬路，忽然，當那後面的一輛黄包車拉近這兩人時，那車上的外國水兵，竟高舉着鉢頭似的拳頭，猛向這兩位中之一位的頭上，盡力的打了一拳，當他回頭看時，外國水兵依然高坐在黄包車上，飛馳而去，</p>
<p>天哪！中國人是這樣的被人當作猪狗啊</p>
<p>我幻想着，假使那位被打的同胞，稍有抵抗的精神，他就追上去打還了一拳，那末那兩個水兵，一定會立刻跳下車來，追着了他，雨點般的拳頭，就落在他的身上，他滿面一定會淌着血，躺在地上沉吟，那兩個外國水兵，帶着勝利的微笑，揚長而去，剩了一圈看閙熱的我們貴同胞們，面上暫時有點怒容，隠約地也聽到嬉笑聲······</p>
<p>唉！我不敢再往下想，</p>

<h3>女接綫生</h3>
<p>— 和周</p>
<p>眞是「吃一行怨一行」，有一位在華界電話局接綫的女戚，我問她「接綫生生活還滿意嗎？」她便聯珠般訴說了一番「嘆苦」的話，她道：</p>
<p>做電話接綫生眞苦，賽過當警察，值班要挨時間，躱又躱不脫的，有時三個鐘頭一班，有時六個鐘頭一班，休息的辰光，只能在宿舍裏憇息，有事出來，要向主管處告假，脫時不到局要處罰，斷命的薪金又少飯薪金共支二十元，嗣後就很難遞加了，工作揩旣刻板，實在覺得乏味得很，外面接綫進來，一般浮滑靑年，常在電話中尋開心，瞎胡調，雖然對面不見人，可是已夠受他舞弄了，有時接綫忙得不堪，要是對這一方面遲一些兒，他們便報告五十號主管</p>
<p>處彷佛尋事似的，說我們得罪了他，故意不接，呀唉！總之，幹接綫生生活是很苦的，尤其是吾等女子，</p>
<p>聽了這一席話，我瞭解一些現實的女子職業者的概念，</p>

<h3>Planned Nations vs. Unplanned Nations</h3>
<p>Planning is the foundation of action; planning without action is empty talk; action without planning is a waste of energy. Only planned action can proceed smoothly, and only planned action can reap good results. This is true for individuals, and even more so for nations.</p>
<p>A nation's politics involves countless threads, and in the absence of planning, chaos and disorganization are inevitable. Because there is no plan, there is a waste of both spiritual and material resources. Or, personal corruption and malfeasance thrive, leading to a multitude of ills that prevent progress on the right track. Planning is especially important in productive industries. Production without planning inevitably results in waste, and the losses are incalculable.</p>
<p>The United States is the most prosperous capitalist country today. However, if we examine the waste of resources in the United States, it is beyond our comprehension.</p>
<p>For example, in 1920, tens of thousands of watermelons were dumped into the Potomac River, and tens of thousands of gallons of milk were poured into the Illinois River. In 1921, central and southwestern states posted notices urging farmers to burn grains instead of coal. Yet, on the other hand, millions of starving and freezing unemployed people wandered the streets, unable to obtain clothing or food. In recent years, the economic recession has been even more astonishing. There are over 1,300 types of stocks in the United States, with a total of 130 billion shares. Calculated at current prices as of March 1st of this year, they are worth 276 billion gold dollars, but this is only half the figure compared to March 1st of last year. Compared to the figure on September 1st, 1929, it is only slightly less than one-third. In less than three years, losses have reached a staggering 600 billion gold dollars. Furthermore, the total income of American farmers last year was 69.2 billion gold dollars, a decrease of 50 billion gold dollars compared to 1929. Because the government lacks a comprehensive plan for national production and distribution, individual free competition is followed by overproduction, factory closures, and a daily increase in the unemployed population. Eventually, the recession becomes increasingly painful, leading to an irreversible tragic situation. This kind of unplanned production and waste is not only a tragedy but also a crime and a mad act. Moreover, the powerful military preparations and cruel wars of various countries are all forms of waste. The irrecoverable losses from this waste are even more obvious. However, in the absence of planning, this waste and this recession are inevitable.</p>
<p>However, the planning we are referring to here is not just about one thing. More importantly, it is about making a comprehensive plan for the entire nation and the entire society. Each industry in the United States does have detailed plans, but these plans are only for individual interests and not for the welfare of the public. The United States, like other capitalist countries, is like this. Therefore, if we only plan based on the nature of a certain thing, even if we succeed, it will ultimately lead to evil.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the revolution, the chaos and poverty of the Soviet Union were well known. However, since the Five-Year Plan was established and implemented step by step, it has been able to move forward step by step into prosperity amidst the global recession. This is because it has a comprehensive plan, and the plan is tailored to the needs of the masses and aims to benefit the masses.</p>
<p>Currently, everything in our country is disordered and fragmented. Even if there is a so-called plan, it is often shelved on the desk for a long time and never implemented. Recent examples include the Ministry of Industry's Four-Year Plan and the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department's Three-Year Plan, which are rare achievements in our country's administration. However, without a comprehensive national plan, a department or bureau must have a comprehensive design to coordinate them. Only then can the machine run flexibly and smoothly. National politics must have a comprehensive plan for systematic promotion, so that everything can be in order, without being in vain, and without causing a multitude of ills.</p>
<p>Therefore, we sincerely hope that our country can become a country with a comprehensive plan, and that this plan is a comprehensive plan for the welfare of the majority of the people. At the same time, we also hope that this plan will not be just empty talk, but will concentrate the nation's energy to gradually promote its implementation.</p>
<p>Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<h3>Investigation Team Arrived in Beiping Last Night</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang and Others Welcomed Them at the Station</p>
<p>Lord Lytton Made a Statement</p>
<p>Beiping, May 5th. The Lytton Investigation Team arrived in Beiping at 9:00 PM. Zhang Xueliang welcomed them at the station. After leaving the station, they went to the Beijing Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Beiping. The Lytton Investigation Team arrived here by special train at 9:00 PM tonight. Zhang Xueliang and many important Chinese and foreign officials welcomed them at the station unofficially. A Reuters reporter met with Lord Lytton, who said that he stopped briefly at Jinzhou to listen to the opinions of the Japanese, and also stopped briefly at Yuguan to listen to the opinions of the Chinese. The team members spent the night in Beidaihe and plan to stay in Beiping for two weeks, then go to Japan, and then return to China to prepare a report. After returning to China, they will probably reside in Beidaihe, but the decision will depend on inspections of other places. When asked about the progress of the investigation, Lord Lytton replied that the mission has received all kinds of assistance and courtesy from the Chinese and Japanese governments. All the difficulties encountered in Manchuria were caused by "other individuals," but they were resolved through patience and face-to-face discussions. The spirit of harmony has proven its effectiveness, and the investigation team will continue its work in this spirit. The reporter also inquired with Dr. Wellington Koo, who said that his trip to Japan was still under consideration. The Chinese government wants to appoint him as the ambassador to France, and this matter is also under consideration. (Reuters, May 5th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Authorities Welcomed Them at the Station</h3>
<p>Tianjin. The representatives of the League of Nations Investigation Team and Dr. Wellington Koo and his wife toured the western mountains of Beidaihe and visited the seaside on the morning of the 5th. The French representative, Mr. Roche, visited friends in the eastern mountains. They boarded a special train westward at noon on the 5th. The train did not stop along the way, only stopping for forty minutes in Tanggu. Because the Japanese opposed the Chinese staff members You Mijian, Li Yintang, and Ms. Chen Yichun entering the country through the pseudo-Fengshan Road, they took the route through Dalian. The special train waited in Tanggu for the three to board before departing. It arrived at Tianjin East Station at 5:45 PM. Wang Shuchang, representative, Huang Zongfa, director of education, Chen Baoquan, director of construction, Lin Chengxiu, mayor, Zhou Longguang, legal commander, and Nara, representative, all got out of the car and shook hands one by one. Koo told reporters that he had already talked to the press about the situation in the Northeast yesterday in Beidaihe. Because of the short time, he could not talk in detail. When he arrived in Beiping, he would release more details. (Special dispatch, May 5th)</p>
<p>Tianjin. The investigation team passed through here at 6:00 PM this afternoon on their way to Beiping. Wellington Koo met alone with a reporter from the Dentsu News Agency at the station. When asked if he was going to Japan, Koo replied that he had not decided yet. When asked why he had not decided, Koo hesitated slightly and replied that he would not comment before contacting the government. Then he shook hands with the reporter and left. (Dentsu News Agency, May 5th)</p>
<h3>Visited the Scenery of Beidaihe Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Beiping. The five representatives and Wellington Koo, etc., went to Lianfeng Mountain at the western end of Beidaihe at 7:00 AM on the 5th. Lord Lytton looked at the distant mountains and the nearby sea from the top of the mountain with great joy and visited the deer park by the sea, taking photos and filming movies. The security was very strict wherever they went. They went down the mountain at 10:30 AM and boarded a special train westward at 11:00 AM. They passed through Tianjin briefly and arrived in Beiping at 8:00 PM in the evening. Zhang Xueliang and military and political leaders all personally went to the station to welcome them. Flags were hung in Beiping for one day on the 5th. (Special dispatch, May 5th)</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan. This morning at 9:00 AM, the investigation team, accompanied by Wellington Koo and his wife, He Zhuguo, and others, toured the scenery in Beidaihe and surveyed the housing. At noon, all the personnel took a special train to Beiping, stopping briefly in Tianjin. They are expected to arrive in Beiping at 9:00 PM in the evening. He Zhuguo will accompany them to the location where the report will be compiled. The location has not yet been determined. The Northeast warships Yongxiang and Yongsheng are anchored off the coast of Beidaihe and will open to Qinhuangdao in the evening. (Special dispatch, May 5th)</p>
<h3>Wellington Koo May Be Appointed Ambassador</h3>
<p>Nanjing. According to Chinese sources, Dr. Wellington Koo will become the ambassador to France, and will serve as the Chinese representative at the League of Nations General Assembly in September of this year. Other Chinese representatives include Dr. Yan Huiqing, who is currently in Geneva, and the newly appointed ambassador to the United Kingdom, Guo Taiqi. However, this news has not been officially confirmed. (Reuters, May 5th)</p>
<h3>Lytton Answers Several Questions</h3>
<p>Beiping. A reporter visited Lytton tonight and raised seven questions. According to his written response, the main points are as follows: (1) The investigation team spent the period from April 20 to June 4 in the Northeast entirely collecting materials on the situation before and after the incident, as well as the current situation. The delegation will understand everything after receiving the materials and conducting investigations. A report will be submitted to the League of Nations, which will be released at that time. It is not convenient to express opinions at this time. (2) After arriving in the Northeast, the Japanese government and military authorities did their best to help with the team's work. The delegation received hospitality from both China and Japan and treated both countries equally. However, many difficulties were encountered in the Northeast, but these were not imposed by the Japanese government or the authorities, but by a third party. The delegation dealt with them patiently and they have now passed. (3) The reason for not meeting Ma Zhanshan was that the northern part of the Eastern Province was in a time of war, so to meet Ma, the local authorities and the Soviet Union would have to help, but this was impossible. (4) The natural beauty of Beidaihe is truly admired and the impressions are excellent. However, the action has not been decided. In addition to Beidaihe, many other places will be visited before deciding on the location for compiling the report. (5) It is hoped that the Chinese and Japanese governments will give the delegation a kind of sincerity to find a solution. It is believed that both countries will give sincerity. (Special dispatch, May 5th)</p>
<p>Tianjin. The British representative, Lord Lytton, gave a statement in English saying that he has obtained a lot of material in the Northeast for six weeks, but it is difficult to release it because it has not been sorted out. The Japanese were quite polite to our group. Although there were some disagreements, all the representatives were able to tolerate them, so they did not feel difficult. It was originally intended to meet Ma Zhanshan, but this was not possible due to the war and traffic obstruction. A brief visit to Beidaihe was made, and the scenery was excellent. We will visit a certain place for investigation once before making a final report. We hope that Japan will restore good feelings towards China as soon as possible, which is the fortune of East Asia. The special train left Tianjin for Beiping at six o'clock. (Hui Telegraph, May 5th)</p>
<h3>Lytton and Others Held Talks on the Train</h3>
<p>Beiping. Lytton convened the four representatives of the United States, Germany, Italy, and France, as well as Representative Gu, for talks inside the train at Yu. He Zhuguo also participated. Japanese Representative Yoshida was not present. (Special dispatch, May 6th)</p>
<p>Beiping. When the special train passed through Tianjin, the five representatives held a meeting with Wellington Koo and He Zhuguo in attendance. Quick establishment of a buffer solution for the urgent matter of Yuguan to avoid misunderstandings between the two armies was discussed. The matter of the pseudo-national flag being hung at Yuguan upon the arrival of the representatives was also discussed for a long time. (Special dispatch, May 5th)</p>

The US Deputy Commander Barryd visited Wang Yimin, the director of the Public Security Bureau, on the afternoon of the 5th and asked what to do if the plainclothes team was going to cause trouble again. Wang replied that he had received the report and had made adequate preparations. He believes that if it is purely a plainclothes team riot, the police force is sufficient to eliminate it. If a third party participates, he will have to ask his superiors for instructions. On the evening of the 5th, at around 9:00 PM, traitors ran wildly on Beima Road, and people suspected that something had happened.

<p>Zhang Zhizhong Advocates</p>
<h3>Vigorously Implement Military Education</h3>
<p>Nanjing. Zhang Zhizhong talked about the recent anti-Japanese battle of the Fifth Army in Shanghai. As far as I can see, the Japanese army relies entirely on the precision and profit of its equipment. If you talk about the god of war, our army can really be one against three.

<h3>Saito Announces New Policy Towards Manchuria</h3>
<p>Decides to Recognize Independence of the Puppet State of Manchuria First</p>
<p>Still Sings the Praises of the Open Door Policy to Deceive the Powers</p>
<p>If Misunderstood, Will Not Hesitate to Withdraw from the League of Nations</p>
<p>China United Press, Tokyo, May 5th: Prime Minister Saito announced yesterday nine items of his new policy towards Manchuria, the content of which is: (1) If the League of Nations cannot agree with Japan's policy towards Manchuria and insists on opposing Japan, Japan will resolutely withdraw from the League of Nations. (2) Japan has no ambition to infringe on Russia's rights and interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway. (3) If Manchuria can be independent, even if the powers do not recognize it, Japan will definitely be the first to recognize it. (4) Japan will still abide by the principles of the open door policy and equal opportunity in Manchuria. (5) The Nine-Power Treaty has points that are out of touch with the times. If the countries intend to revise it, Japan is very willing to participate in order to meet the needs of the new situation. There are four other items that all belong to Russian policy, which are omitted.</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, May 5th: Babb, a correspondent stationed in Tokyo for the Associated Press of America, submitted a questionnaire to Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Saito regarding Japan's foreign policy. Saito answered his nine questions in writing on the 4th. The details of its content are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What about the saying that Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations?</p>
<p>Answer: If Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it cannot be said that the path Japan is taking is not correct, but I hope that this kind of thing does not happen.</p>
<p>Question: What about the rumored danger of the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War? Does Japan intend to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Russia? Does the fact that Russia owns the Chinese Eastern Railway constitute a threat to Japan's interests in North Manchuria?</p>
<p>Answer: The Japanese government has recently repeatedly stated that there is no danger of a Russo-Japanese War. The Russian government's attitude towards various cases in Manchuria has also been completely correct. The Japanese government hopes that the Russian government will stop concentrating troops on the Far Eastern border. The result of the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty weakens the power of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and has a negative impact on countries that have not concluded a non-aggression treaty with Japan. The conclusion of this treaty is nothing more than the establishment of special friendly relations that have been discussed repeatedly since last year. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider all the things attached to this issue in advance before determining this issue. The Soviet Russian government's rights and interests in the Chinese Eastern Railway do not infringe on Japan's economic interests.</p>
<p>Question: Is it beneficial for Japan to acquire Russian</p>
<p>interests by means of buying out the Chinese Eastern Railway? Is it necessary to grasp the military management rights of the railway in order to restore peace in Manchuria?</p>
<p>Answer: For the reasons mentioned above, Japan cannot say that it is in Japan's interest to acquire any rights and interests of other countries in the Chinese Eastern Railway.</p>
<p>Question: Does Japan recognize Manchuria? Is there any intention to annex it or to use a majority of Japanese advisors in Manchuria to control the policies of Manchuria? Will your government send more troops to Manchuria than now? How do you feel?</p>
<p>Answer: The issue of recognizing Manchuria can only be decided after the new country's ability to be independent is proven or based on the general conditions for recognizing new countries. In view of the proximity of Japan and Manchuria and the relationship between Manchuria's life and death rights and interests, it is necessary to establish this issue. It goes without saying that Japan has no ambition to annex Manchuria, and it does not want to control the policies of the Manchurian authorities by any illegitimate means. Japan only hopes to have sufficient rights and interests in its own country within the territory under the rule of Manchuria. As for whether to send more troops to Manchuria, it is based on how the situation will develop in the future. If the League of Nations understands that the Chinese government's demands for the Manchurian region are by no means substantial, and the current unstable political situation in China has resulted in an unusually rampant state of Qinzhou bandits, military action in that area can be ended if this kind of fact can be eradicated.</p>
<p>Question: Does your government agree with maintaining a policy of open commerce to all countries in Manchuria? Does your changed commercial government consider the issue of a Japan-Manchuria customs union or other economic cooperation?</p>
<p>Answer: It is not necessary to repeat that the Japanese government has always maintained the principles of open door policy and equal opportunity in Manchuria for all countries. The issue of a Japan-Manchuria customs union or other economic cooperation is an unimaginable thing.</p>
<p>Question: Is the Japanese government considering strict military regulations and preventing the recurrence of direct actions such as the May 15th Incident? Is there a danger of transformation of the right wing or reactionary factions in Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: The issue of military regulations is strongly maintained by the Minister of the Army. I cannot believe what the meaning of "right wing or reactionary faction" is. I cannot understand what the so-called transformation means can increase the political power of anyone. I cannot understand what the meaning of the so-called fascist movement is. If the questioner means that the party politics cannot represent the public opinion of the people, then I believe that there is no other way to restrain this statement except that the leaders of the parties cooperate with each other to implement good governance to satisfy the hopes of the people.</p>
<p>Question: Does your government agree with the issue of abolishing the Nine-Power Treaty or revising the Four-Power Treaty?</p>
<p>Answer: If other signatory countries hope to revise these two treaties, then Japan will definitely not fail to cooperate. However, China is currently changing constantly, and it is difficult to guarantee that the treaty needs to be revised repeatedly.</p>
<p>Question: European and American public opinion believes that Japan has lost its legitimacy regarding the Manchurian and Shanghai cases. What are the new cabinet's thoughts on this? What kind of policies does your government plan to implement to improve Japan's relationship with Western countries?</p>
<p>Answer: The new cabinet believes that most of the influential people in European and American public opinion cannot fully observe the situation in the Shanghai and Manchurian cases, and as a result, they oppose Japan's actions. In particular, most people believe that there is a legitimately organized country being invaded by Japan. They do not know about China's atrocities against Japanese railways and marines, and they determine that Manchuria is a part of the territory ruled by the Chinese government. This kind of view is definitely lacking in correctness and is not inevitable. As the countries gradually understand Japan's position, Japan's relationship with other countries will definitely improve. The policies that Japan should implement are to abide by the covenants, maintain the principles of open door policy and equal opportunity, and break down tariff obstacles that hinder existing national trade in order to seek the recovery of the world economy.</p>
<p>The ninth question concerns the issue of Philippine independence, which is omitted here.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, May 5th: Prime Minister Saito has ordered the relevant government agencies to investigate the matter of the four-headed political control of Manchuria. He has also ordered Shiraoka, the Governor of Kwantung, and Uchida, the President of Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway), to go to Beijing to discuss the matter. Therefore, Governor Shiraoka will go to Beijing in the next few days, and President Uchida will also arrive in Tokyo around the 12th or 13th. Before President Uchida arrives in Tokyo, Prime Minister Saito will temporarily decide on a draft proposal. After meeting with President Uchida, he will ask him to take the position of Foreign Minister and ask him to cooperate on the Manchurian issue. When Uchida is appointed as Foreign Minister, the Manchurian issue seems to be rapidly concretized.</p>
<h3>Herriot's New Cabinet</h3>
<p>French Public Opinion Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, May 4th: The new cabinet formed by Herriot of France last night has been well received by the Parisian newspapers today. Only the extreme right-wing newspapers, including the L'Ordre, expressed open opposition to the new government, while the more moderate right-wing newspapers seemed to be waiting quietly for the development of the situation before adding criticism. Other newspapers, such as the famous conservative Le Figaro, expressed significant satisfaction with the appointment of Pétain as Minister of War. Le Journal de Paris, also a conservative newspaper, claimed that most of the new cabinet members are extraordinarily talented and there is no doubt that they can perform their duties happily. Of course, the left-wing newspapers welcomed the new cabinet enthusiastically, but they were also not without fear of the extremely difficult responsibilities of the new cabinet. L'Ère Nouvelle said that the internal and external situation is full of ominous possibilities, and the previous cabinet had made various mistakes, so the new cabinet inherited a bad legacy. Some say that the majority of opposition newspapers have a compromise attitude towards the new cabinet because the Lausanne Conference is about to open and they do not want to embarrass the government.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, May 4th: Former French Prime Minister Tardieu handed over to Herriot at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon. Herriot will convene cabinet members tomorrow to stipulate the powers of each person and consider the main points of the new cabinet declaration.</p>

<h3>Bloodless Revolution Succeeds in Chile</h3>
<p>Economic Instability is the Fuse</p>
<p>Revolutionary Army Occupies the Capital in Two Hours</p>
<p>President Montero Forced to Abdicate</p>
<p>Dávila Assumes the Powers of Head of State</p>
<p>Socialist Government Announced</p>
<p>National News Agency, Santiago, Chile, May 5th: The Chilean army and air force suddenly rebelled today. The leader of this revolution is Mr. Dávila, the former Chilean ambassador to Washington. Mr. Dávila demanded that Chilean President Montero immediately resign. Montero is a member of the Conservative Party and was elected president on October 4th of last year. The election situation at that time was very chaotic and there were riots, resulting in the death of ten people and the injury of more than one hundred. After today's revolution broke out, Montero initially refused to resign, so the rebels sent Montero an ultimatum with a time limit of only two hours, stating that if the revolutionary army did not receive the president's letter of resignation within two hours, it would immediately take coercive action. After the ultimatum was delivered, approximately 2,500 revolutionary soldiers were summoned from various places and marched towards the capital of Santiago, claiming that they would fight to the death to establish a socialist republic. Montero was immediately softened and withdrew from the presidential residence, and revolutionary army leader Dávila immediately moved into the presidential residence, assuming the powers of head of state and announcing the establishment of a socialist government. Thus, the Chilean revolution was completed without bloodshed.</p>
<p>The shape of this revolution was indeed very sudden, but the gestation period between them has actually been long. The biggest reason is nothing more than the depression of the world economy, which has reduced Chile's exports and the national income is not enough, so it has to implement strict austerity measures, so the salaries of civil servants cannot be paid in full. On August 19th of last year, it had no choice but to announce the suspension of foreign debt payments in order to maintain domestic reserves. In the spring of last year, the Congress during the tenure of President Ibáñez gave the president the authority of a dictator, and Ibáñez promulgated as many as 150 emergency decrees, including regulations such as newspaper censorship, which were the leading wires that aroused backlash. After the cabinet fell on July 9, the succeeding cabinet fell again in a few days. The third cabinet existed for only one day before being dismissed by a student riot. After the fourth cabinet was established, it used high-pressure means on the students. When the students of the National University were driven out by the government with force, two students died. At that time, the whole country was indignant and agitated. Ibáñez had to hand over power to Senator Laitelier, and he himself left in disguise. Laitelier soon also found it difficult to deal with and recommended Montero as the Prime Minister of the Cabinet and concurrently the President. Montero later took advantage of the domestic turmoil to obtain the real presidency, but before long, internal affairs and economic disputes arose one after another, and there was no peace. Although these are all past facts, they are the fuse for the recent rebellion.</p>
<h3>Indian Vallabhbhai Patel Arrested</h3>
<p>A Major Blow to the Independence Movement</p>
<p>Conflicts Between Indian and Muslim Continue</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, May 5th: A man named "Dictator", which means "head of the All-India Congress", was arrested in Bombay today. This person can be compared to Vallabhbhai Patel, the leader of the Irish Revolution. He is said to live in no fixed place and never stay in one place for two nights in a row. When the authorities wanted to arrest him, he would always escape. It is said that the activities of the All-India Congress are all directed by him behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, May 5th: Officials have now confirmed that there was indeed a clash between Indian and Muslim religions in Alwar King Park. The country sent troops to fire and disperse the rioters, killing two and injuring thirty. There was also a conflict between the two religions in the town of Pandali in the Mengjhebu province. Muslims there are divided into old and new factions that are not connected to each other. The Indians took advantage of this opportunity to attack both factions, killing and injuring many people. The police eventually restored order. All those killed and injured were Muslims.</p>
<h3>Prospects for German Politics</h3>
<p>The Nazi Party Expresses its Intention to Soften its Policies</p>
<p>Prepare to Cooperate Closely with Conservatives</p>
<p>French Newspapers Have a Good Impression of the Papen Cabinet</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, May 4th: This morning, the German nationalist newspapers expressed joy at the dissolution of the Reichstag, regarding it as a precursor to establishing a new domestic policy, saying that this new policy would be completely different from the policies followed by Brüning and previous cabinets, and predicted that the National Socialist Party would definitely win a major victory in the general election in the future, and may even occupy an absolute majority of seats in the new Reichstag. Even if not, it can jointly control the government with other nationalist parties. Nazi leader Hitler said in an election speech in Mecklenburg yesterday that the National Socialist Party is ready to form a coalition cabinet with conservative parties. This statement is extremely important. Even the Catholic Workers' Union newspaper Deutsche Zeitung even claimed that there is a real understanding between Hitler and the current government cabinet members, and the two sides will cooperate closely after the election. Hitler also expressed his intention to soften the party's policies and slightly curb the radical demands of party members in political and economic matters. The newspaper also said that when the two sides met, the crown prince was already present, and the crown prince was preparing to play an important role on the political stage in the future. However, most people in political circles do not believe this statement.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, May 5th: The German cabinet held a cabinet meeting this morning to make final revisions to some of the new emergency orders mentioned in yesterday's general policy. Some of these orders were drafted before Brüning resigned. In addition, it may include the cancellation of the ban on the National Socialist Party's stormtroopers and the amendment of the current overly severe newspaper laws.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, May 4th: The attitude of the French newspapers towards the new German cabinet was unexpected, with no hostility at all. The general editors seemed to have decided not to evaluate the new cabinet until after it had issued its general policy and taken measures. At this time, the newspapers were carrying reports that the new German Prime Minister was previously a member of the Franco-German Committee and had made considerable efforts to promote Franco-German friendship, and that he often came to Paris and associated with French Catholics.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, May 4th: The German newspapers have different views on the government's general policy declaration, ranging from extreme approval to fierce attacks. However, there is one point that most of them agree on: that the declaration is sufficient to cut off the entanglements in domestic politics and clearly indicate the battle lines for the future election. Conservative newspapers, in particular, often hold this view, but even these newspapers, while praising the government, cannot help but fear that it will be difficult to achieve its expectations. The Deutsche Tageszeitung of the Farmers' Party claimed that there have been many policy changes in the eventful autumn of the past twelve years, but there has never been such a clear and powerful announcement. This can be said to be a radical change in domestic and cultural policy. The local leadership newspaper of the National Rights Party claimed that the National Rights Party did not take responsibility for forming the cabinet and will only judge it based on its political achievements. Although the new government's policies are mostly correct without a doubt, it cannot avoid being high-profile. It also said that the declaration expresses little about what it wants to do in domestic and foreign affairs, but there is one point that is extremely agreeable, that is, at this time, it is necessary to give the people the opportunity to decide through voting what path the country's policy should take in the future. Among the opposing views, the Deutsche Zeitung, a Catholic Workers' Union organ, was the first to strongly claim that the general policy declaration was only sufficient to show that the new government was not a cabinet focused on talent from all over the country and that its organizational purpose was to attack the Catholic Party and the Socialist Party. Later, it also strongly refuted the statement in the declaration that the Catholic Party was rewarding the dissemination of "cultural radicalism". The Berliner Tageblatt criticized it even more fiercely, saying that the general policy declaration was no less than a declaration of war against all constructions of the Republican Germany, and it was a purely reactionary policy.</p>
<h3>New Greek Cabinet Formed</h3>
<p>Venizelos Returns to Power</p>
<p>National News Agency, Athens, May 4th: The Greek cabinet tide has ended today and Venizelos has returned to power to form a new cabinet.</p>

<h3>U.S. House Passes New Tax Bill</h3>
<p>Budget Balance Still in Doubt</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, May 4th: The federal tax bill passed by the joint committee of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives was debated enthusiastically in the House of Representatives today and passed as originally proposed. It was immediately transferred to the Senate for a vote on Monday. If it is passed by the Senate, it can be sent to the President for signature and promulgation so that budget revenues and expenditures can be offset.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, May 4th: According to the New York Evening Post, Wall Street expressed doubt about the U.S. government's claim that it has now balanced the budget. Today, the newspaper carried an article saying that even if government expenditures are reduced by $360 million as requested by President Hoover, the expenditures in the 1933 budget will still reach $40 billion. The total revenue from taxes this year is probably less than $20 billion. Assuming that the revenue from taxes in 1933 is also this amount, plus the $1.119 billion that can be obtained from the supplementary tax bill, the total revenue will still be less than $31.2 billion, a shortfall of $8.8 billion compared to expenditures. If the move to raise huge sums of money for public relief is unavoidable, then the United States will have to borrow money to support its expenses next year, in an amount of approximately $15 billion to $25 billion.</p>
<h3>England and Italy Sign an Agreement to Continue Debt Repayment with the U.S.</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, May 4th: The British and Italian ambassadors to the United States signed an agreement in Washington today on behalf of their respective governments to continue repaying war debts. The war debts were stopped for one year due to the Hoover moratorium plan.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Adachi Faction Plans to Form a New Party</h3>

This time, he is very satisfied with the establishment of the super-parliamentary cabinet that he has been advocating. The Adachi faction plans to start a new movement at this opportunity.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>League of Nations Investigation Team</h3>
<p>The Course of Leaving Harbin</p>
<p>Japanese Surveillance was Extremely Strict, Chinese People Had No Way to Meet Them</p>
<p>Details of the Arrest of Harbin Reporter Wang Yanshi</p>
<p>A correspondent from Beiping reported that people from Harbin said the League of Nations investigation team arrived in Harbin at 5 PM on May 9th. When departing from Changchun, Japanese troops monitored them along the way and airplanes followed them. The investigation team was nominally 160 people, but in reality, Japanese staff, military police, and journalists accounted for three-fifths of them. From Chairman Lytton down, each person was monitored by four or five Japanese. Gu Weijun was especially closely watched. Upon arrival in Harbin, from the general station to the Modern Hotel in Daoli, all were guarded by Japanese military police, plainclothes detectives, and so-called Manchukuo puppet police, prohibiting pedestrians and vehicles. The severity of the situation was beyond description. After the League of Nations investigation team arrived at the residence, more than forty Japanese military police and plainclothes detectives were monitoring the inside and outside of the hotel every day. Whenever an investigating commissioner went out, four or five plainclothes Japanese followed. Outside the hotel, there were also large groups of puppet state police guarding, not even allowing pedestrians to pass through. Therefore, during the ten or more days the investigation team stayed in Harbin, apart from collecting materials under Japanese control, they gained nothing else. Only people in the transportation sector supplied a small amount of material and secretly handed it over to the British and American consulates for transmission. Almost no one was able to meet with the personnel of the investigation team. Two staff members in the investigation team stayed in Harbin for two more days due to business. The Japanese newspaper, the Harbin News, fabricated a news story with a very large headline, claiming, "Strange News and Scandals After the Investigation Team Left Harbin," saying that they were infatuated with women and unwilling to leave immediately. They spared no effort in attacking the investigation team. Two days before the investigation team came to Harbin, Wang Yanshi, the chief editor of the Harbin International Concordance Newspaper, was arrested by the Japanese military police. Wang had been in the Harbin press for many years and was very young and passionate. Therefore, his daily news writings were very emotional. Before the Harbin International Concordance Newspaper ceased publication, Wang was a special reporter for the newspaper, and also a correspondent for major newspapers in Shanghai and Tianjin. After the Japanese army entered Harbin, all Harbin communication agencies were controlled, and personnel were stationed at the radio station to check incoming and outgoing telegrams. Logically, it was impossible for Wang to send telegrams. However, because Wang shouldered a heavy responsibility, he believed that after the Northeast fell, he was the only one who could communicate news to the mainland. If he fled, the people of the country would have no way of knowing the situation in the Northeast. Therefore, he tried his best to persuade the Japanese inspectors amid ten thousand difficulties and spent his monthly income on entertainment expenses. As a result, telegrams could still be sent. At first, the inspection was very strict, and important news could not be sent. Later, Wang took advantage of the inspectors' inattention to send unfavorable real telegrams from the Japanese side. After nearly three months, the Japanese inspection chief, after being entertained by Wang, was not too harsh on the telegrams sent by Wang. Later, on March 9, the International Concordance Newspaper resumed publication. In this thorny environment, it was already impossible to continue running the newspaper. The newspaper authorities were only afraid that their property would be confiscated by others and had to resume publication. After three days of publication, sales plummeted. The responsible editors resigned one after another because the situation was indeed untenable. Wang had already resigned in advance but was strongly invited by the newspaper to temporarily serve as editor-in-chief to maintain the newspaper for two months. In an extremely difficult situation, he restored the newspaper's reputation, maintained sales, and gained social understanding. However, this attracted the jealousy of some people. Before the League of Nations investigation team came to Harbin, Wang collected more than a dozen kinds of materials, classified and compiled them into a volume, intending to ask a friend from a certain consulate to hand it over to Secretary-General Haas when the investigation team arrived. The matter was extremely confidential and there was no reason to be exposed. Unexpectedly, Shanghai reporters Ge Gongzhen and Gu Zhizhong, who came north with Gu Weijun, sent several letters to Wang when they were prevented from returning south, asking Wang to pay attention to the news when the investigation team arrived. The Tianjin Yishibao also sent a telegram to Wang asking him to work hard. All letters and telegrams were obtained by the Japanese. As a result, the Japanese paid attention to Wang. Those who were usually dissatisfied with Wang secretly informed the Japanese military police that Wang would do this and that. At noon on May 7, the Japanese sent two plainclothes military police in a car to Wang's residence on Yaopu Street in Daoli. Wang had just returned from outside and saw the Japanese military police car. Knowing that he could not avoid it, he immediately calmed down and opened the door. The two Japanese, after seeing Wang, asked Wang to go to the police administration office. They did not get out of the car at the administration office and went to the Nanyang Japanese military police headquarters. After arriving, Wang was locked in the guard duty room, and no one was allowed to visit him. Wang's family spent two days trying to get Wang's news. After Wang was arrested, Harbin society was shocked and worried about Wang. However, Wang was detained inside and used his journalistic and social skills and was not treated harshly. Within a few days, he had a relationship with the Japanese soldiers. Some soldiers even took care of Wang's food and clothing and even covered him with a quilt at night. This was unexpected after Wang was arrested. After being detained for nine days, a sergeant asked Wang, referring to Wang's telegrams about Zhang Xueliang, suspecting him of helping the old Jilin army, saying that he would be released after the military ended. Regarding the League of Nations matter, he concealed it and did not mention it. Wang was arrested on the 7th and detained for eighteen days. If there was nothing to do during the day, he learned ordinary Japanese. It was not until three days after the League of Nations investigation team left Harbin that he was released by the former Qing old Zeng Zigu and two shops. However, there were still conditions attached to the release, and he had to go to the Japanese military police headquarters once a day and be investigated by the team to see if he had violated Japanese and new state behavior. Only after the Japanese side understood that there was nothing else could he be allowed freedom. If he wanted to send news telegrams to Shanghai and Tianjin, any military news must be checked by the Japanese military police, and there must be no news and comments that disturb people's hearts. Wang must be responsible for investigating and reporting at any time when other people's communications are unfavorable to the Japanese side. On May 24, Wang was released and returned home. His family was overjoyed to see him alive and could not help but shed tears. Wang's situation is very difficult now, and it is impossible to escape. Someone asked him about his arrest, but he refused to talk about it because the Japanese side told Wang when he was released that he was not allowed to write articles and news about his feelings about being arrested. Wang had to do this to avoid trouble. Before Wang was arrested, telegrams between Tianjin and Shanghai relied solely on Wang to transmit them. Other reporters stationed in Harbin had already fled. In the short term, news from the Northeast will be difficult to obtain except through foreign communication agencies. (May 29)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan</h3>
<p>Telegram of Oath to Fight Against Japan</p>
<p>Make Good Use of the Great Power of Endurance and Sweep Away the Ugly Class</p>
<p>Fighting to Avenge National Humiliation is Also Fighting for Survival</p>
<p>A correspondent from Beiping reported that Ma Zhanshan had prepared an army to fight against Japan in Heihe and was ready. On May 15, Ma personally led the three armies to depart. Ma also served as the commander-in-chief of the front, and Wu Songlin assisted him. Shi Lanbin was the commander of the front. According to recent telegrams, Ma had arrived in Hailun and decided to resist for a long time after holding a military conference. Ma also issued an oath-taking telegram, which was passionate and righteous. The text reads, "I, Zhanshan, secretly left Longsha, returned to Heilongjiang, and suddenly it has been a month. I have long been mindful of the expectations of the people of the country, and recently I have witnessed the misery of my homeland being lost. National hatred and personal grievances are engraved in my heart, and I dare not forget my responsibility to recover it day and night. Now, fortunately, the deployment of my troops has been completed, and I have led all the officers and soldiers from Hailanpao on the 15th of this month. The three armies share the enemy's hatred and are determined to restore the country. In the past, when Han fell, Zifang fought against the Qin emperor. Lulian was ashamed of Shaokang who used a single brigade to revive Xia, and Tian Dan who used Jimo to restore Qi. What the future sees today is like what today sees the past. I hereby announce the gist of the oath-taking to inform and teach those who are humiliated. The Japanese Yamada Takeyoshi once wrote The Fundamental Strategy for Manchuria and Mongolia, which stated that Manchuria and Mongolia are the birthplace of the Qing Dynasty, and by supporting the deposed Emperor Xuantong, Japan will control its politics, finance, military affairs, and all its real power. Reading this, we know that today's puppet state organization is based on decades of research by the other side, not an accidental event overnight. But they also know that today's three eastern provinces are not the world of the Manchus. In the past, during the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the Lieutenant of Liaodong was established. After Zhu Yuanzhang destroyed the Yuan Dynasty, troops were often stationed in Liaodong and the field system was adopted to prevent the barbarians. Later, the Aisin Gioro clan rose in the Hun River Basin, and thus passed through the way to enter and rule the Central Plains. It is known that the three eastern provinces are actually the ancestral property of our thousands of years of ancestors who have combed the wind and bathed in the rain, worked hard with their hands and feet, drove away fierce beasts, and pioneered the wilderness for the generations of our descendants. If our descendants do not inherit the ancestral halls, do not bear the burden of splitting firewood, or even carry bags and burden burdens for Japan and go away, they will have no place in the world when they live, and what face will they have to see their ancestors underground after death? Those Japanese nobles are inherently fond of killing, fearing the strong and bullying the weak, and forgetting righteousness for profit. Especially stealing and dog-stealing are inherent nature of their clowns. Therefore, during the Ming Dynasty, the coastal areas of Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang suffered the most from Japanese pirates. When they came, they were like a mob, and when they left, they were like beasts fleeing. They chose to eat fat and left satisfied. Fortunately, Qi Jiguang used the strength of the Zhejiang troops and severely damaged them. Their atmosphere began to subside. By the time of the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, taking advantage of the decline of the Qing Dynasty, they provoked a dispute with Korea and attempted to annex Liaodong. Although they were blocked by the intervention of Russia, Germany, and France, our Taiwan and Korea were ceded as a result. After defeating Russia, they seized the Middle East Railway and the lease of Lushun and Dalian, and regarded Liaodong as their forbidden area. Since then, Japan has violated the agreement and stationed troops and set up police in the three provinces. Cases of massacres have been heard every day. The most serious ones are the Zhengjiatun Incident in 1916, the Yanji Incident in 1920, the incident of Japanese police shooting and killing people in Xinmintun in 1929, and the recent Wanbaoshan Korean Incident. In the past two decades, blood stains have spread throughout the entire territory. Their purpose is nothing more than to provoke disputes in order to implement the occupation. Our government is unwilling to disrupt peace and has been tolerant and retreating in everything. Seeing that the plan could not be sold, they did not hesitate to act perversely and risked the world's great disrespect and had the September 18th Incident last year. They falsely accused us of dismantling the South Manchuria Railway as an excuse to destroy our arsenal and seize our airfield in one fell swoop, and occupied the important cities and towns of Liaoning and Jilin provinces in dozens of hours. Property was plundered and people were slaughtered. Then they held the deposed emperor and created a puppet state. The executive bodies were mere corpses, the officials were all lackeys, and the power was entrusted to the military headquarters. They stole and hid, filled the road with pits and traps, and hung nets with their hands. Every step they took triggered traps. Those who talked about it were openly executed in the market, and those who criticized them in their hearts were assassinated in secret. As for raping women, burying innocent people alive, and seizing people's property, they were especially happy to do so. Recently, they ordered that no private planting of sorghum be allowed within 20 miles on both sides of the railway, regardless of the people's food, but only for the benefit of their military. Compared to Jin's exhausting Qi's acres, their violence is more than a hundred times greater. If we infer their intentions, wouldn't they want the people of our three provinces to wash their necks and submit to the sword and chopping block before they are happy? The people of our country have suffered deeply from Japanese humiliation and have endured it for a long time. But the Buddhist scriptures say that the greatest power in the world is endurance. Electricity is not stored, it is not fierce; wind is not contained, it is not strong. Now, all of our officers and soldiers must make good use of their greatest power to sweep away the ugly class and return our homeland. Today, we are fighting to restore our homeland, to avenge our national humiliation, and to fight for our survival. We must identify our goals and eat without giving up. If the teacher is upright, he will be strong. What enemy cannot be destroyed? Alas, although the land of our three provinces is vast, how can it accommodate the trespassing of wooden clogs? Although the mountains and forests of our three provinces are beautiful, how can we allow eight-character legs to move back and forth? If their weeds have withered or are late to nourish their blood, know that the trenches are deep and willing to borrow their corpses to fill them. Ma Zhanshan bows."</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Hunan Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Lifted the Seal on the Student Union</p>
<p>But the Original Executive Committee Suspended Their Powers</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha: The Hunan Provincial Government sealed the Hunan Student Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association because it planned to independently launch a total inspection of hate goods, which almost clashed with the business community. Later, the association reported to the provincial party headquarters for punishment and petitioned the provincial government to lift the seal. At the same time, the student representative assembly of various schools believed that the student anti-Japanese association was sealed due to the instigation of Hu Yiru, the principal of Fuchu School, Liu Wonan, the standing committee member of the municipal party headquarters, Yin Deyang, the director of telecommunications, and the instigation of Xiao Laisheng and Zuo Yizhai, the standing committee members of the Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, it was decided to petition the provincial party headquarters for severe punishment and limit the daily lifting of the seal on the student union, and support the normal work of the executive committee, otherwise, all classes will be suspended and a large petition will be held, even at the cost of sacrifice. However, students from more than ten schools, including Qunzhi, Dalu, Fuchu, Jianguo, Wenyi, Nanhua, Hanguang, Shuguang, and Wuben, believed that the government's punishment of the general inspection was excessive, and the representative assembly's decision to suspend all classes for petitioning was also inappropriate. Therefore, they jointly declared their withdrawal from the student representative assembly of various schools and requested the provincial government to order the reorganization of the student anti-Japanese association. Deng Hongti, Tan Wenbin, Guo Zhi, etc. were designated to be responsible for carrying out the reorganization, so there were many differences in opinions among the students for a time. However, the provincial party headquarters believed that He Jian's closure of the student anti-Japanese association was too strict without obtaining prior consent, and did not express sympathy. The petition of the student representatives was allowed to be effectively negotiated with the provincial government, and Huang Xigong was sent to attend the student representative assembly to explain the intention and guarantee the lifting of the seal. Therefore, the provincial government was petitioned with the presentation of the student anti-Japanese association's executive committee to the party committee meeting resolution. He Jian, in order to avoid expanding the conflict, ordered the Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau to lift the seal on the association in three days, and replied to the provincial party headquarters that the association should be reorganized separately. Before the reorganization was properly completed, the original executive should suspend their powers. It is unknown whether the students will comply. (June 3)</p>
<p>Chen Jitang's Army</p>
<h3>Preparing to Cross the Sea to Attack Qiongzhou</h3>
<p>Air Force Captain Zeng Zhetang Arrested After Resigning</p>
<p>A dispatch from Guangzhou: Since Chen Ce and Zhang Huichang's naval and air forces went to Qiongya, there has been no effect from the mediation of Hu Hanmin, Xiao Focheng, and others. Chen Qingyun, the commander of the Marine Corps, has expanded his forces and replaced the county magistrate. Recently, he borrowed more than 70,000 rifles from the Qiongya militia and formed two guard army regiments in each county within a short period of time, totaling 13 regiments. Combined with the original four Marine Corps regiments, the military strength of Qiongya has suddenly increased to 17 regiments, temporarily organized into three brigades. The first brigade commander is Chen Yaoding, the second brigade commander is Chen Ji, and the third brigade commander is Zheng Yan. Qiong Island is surrounded by water on all sides, and transportation is convenient, so the supply of weapons and food is still easy. Now, the warships are covering the gunboats and are on guard day and night to prevent Chen Jitang from sending troops to attack. Chen Jitang has prepared six regiments of troops and concentrated them in the south to seize the opportunity to attack, and has offered a heavy reward to buy ships going out to sea, such as Flying Eagle and Zhongshan ships, for every ship that sincerely surrenders, a reward of 200,000 yuan, so the situation is still tense. However, in this situation, the Guangzhou Air Force has another case of the captain being arrested. After Ding Ji and Xu led the aircraft back to the south, it was rumored that the Air Force would issue a declaration stating that it would not participate in the civil war. However, this declaration has not been issued yet. On the 25th, only a rumor-refuting telegram was published, and there was no mention of obeying military discipline. Unexpectedly, Zeng Zhetang, the captain of the Third Squadron of the Air Force, was arrested. Zeng was from Sichuan, 26 years old, and graduated from the third class of the Dashatou Aviation School in this province. After graduating, he became a pilot and later became the deputy captain of the Third Squadron. The squadron originally entered Jiangxi with the First Army to suppress the Communists. The aircraft were stationed in Zhaoxiong. When the Air Force was reorganized, two aircraft of the squadron suddenly disappeared. Later, it was found that they had fallen on a certain mountain ridge and the aircraft bodies had been destroyed. Soon after, Zhou Baicheng, the captain of the squadron, resigned, and Huang Guangrui, the commander of aviation, promoted the squadron's deputy, Zeng Zhetang, to be the captain, and Huang also appointed Liu Yiguo as the deputy captain. After Zeng served as the captain, his actions were closely watched by Chen Jitang. Later, Zeng went to Hong Kong and was rumored to have contact with former Air Force figures, which caused more controversy. Huang Guangrui ordered the deputy captain to secretly monitor him. Zeng also knew that the environment was not good, so he submitted his resignation a few days ago and returned to Sichuan to visit his relatives. Huang then appointed Ning Mingjie as the captain of the Third Squadron and gave Zeng a travel allowance of 1,000 yuan when he left Guangzhou. Zeng then took his family to Hong Kong on the 22nd. While in Hong Kong, he interacted closely with retired Air Force figures, which was known by the Guangdong Provincial Political Detectives stationed in Hong Kong. All of Zeng's actions were detected. It was also found that Zeng planned to return to Hong Kong. The detective who had been following him to the province secretly telegraphed Chen Jitang on the afternoon of the 24th. Chen immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to send more than a dozen plainclothes detectives to the White Palace Hotel to arrest Zeng and search his luggage, where several thousand Hong Kong dollars were found, as well as many letters from Zhang Huichang. It is rumored that they are related to the movement of Class A pilots fleeing. After Zeng was sent to the Public Security Bureau, he was transferred to the First Army Group's Military Law Office for interrogation and closed confinement. Although some people have asked Chen Jitang to bail him out, it is feared that it will not be easy to be approved. (May 27)</p>

<h3>Xuzhou Discovery of Ancient Han Tomb</h3>
<p>Located at the Western Foot of Zifang Mountain</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Xuzhou Jinpu Railway Station is located at the foot of Zifang Mountain, three miles east of the city. During the Qing Dynasty, when the Yellow River passed through Xuzhou, the river channel was between Xuzhou City and Zifang Mountain. Therefore, the area is still covered with sand and gravel. At that time, the vicinity of Zifang Mountain was also very desolate. However, according to historical records, Zifang Mountain was where Marquis Liu stayed to confront the Chu army. There is a Huangshigong Temple on the mountain, which is now the Zifang Ancestral Hall. It was renovated in previous years. At that time, a Liu Xiang tombstone was also discovered at the foot of Zifang Mountain. However, since the establishment of the Jinpu Railway Station, the population has become dense, and only the most obvious ancient sites still exist. Yesterday (the 2nd), Li Shoulu, a foreman at the Jinpu Station locomotive depot, rented land to build a house on the western foot of Zifang Mountain, east of the locomotive depot. During the excavation, an ancient Han tomb was discovered. The tomb is a cave, with the cave entrance facing west, about four to five feet high and more than ten feet wide. Inside the cave was a large corpse with a skull the size of a dipper, ribs about four to five feet long, and a body more than ten feet long. Although the flesh had decayed, the bones were intact. Beside it were three pottery vessels: one was a gourd-shaped round tile bottle, one was a vase-shaped tile urn, both covered with mountain mud, making it impossible to see the words and patterns on them. Another object was of a unique shape, square like a water bowl, about five inches long and wide, and about two inches high. Each corner had a first roof, doors and windows were complete, and the height including the roof was three inches and zero, weighing two pounds. The vessel was carved with an elephant, also covered with mountain mud, and viewers could not name it. There was also a stone box in the cave, quite deep inside. The foreman used a reed mat to contain and bury the corpse. The excavation of the cave is still continuing. The cave seems to be a tomb passage, but no steles have been found. The three pottery vessels are now placed in the office of Cheng Huating, the director of the Jinpu Station Machinery Section, while two are at Li Shoulu's house, awaiting appraisal by archaeologists. However, judging from the pottery quality and bones, it is likely an ancient tomb from at least before the Han Dynasty. (3rd)</p>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Widow Disputes Property and Hangs Herself: Jiang Wenjing, a widow in Nanqiao South Market, was the first wife of the late Song Wangzhou, the former director of the National Nantong. She has remained chaste for ten years. Her daily life is supported by her aunt, Zhu, who provides 20 yuan per month. Unexpectedly, starting last year, the aunt and daughter-in-law suddenly developed resentment due to trivial matters, resulting in the subsidy not being paid on time. As a result, Ms. Jiang filed a lawsuit with the official government last year requesting relief. After several hearings, no results were obtained. This spring, her relatives Ruan Jingwu and others intervened in mediation, and her aunt allocated a portion of the land to her to manage. However, Ms. Jiang found that her monthly income was still less than 20 yuan, making it difficult to sustain herself. Therefore, she became deeply indebted and, last night around 4 a.m., took advantage of others' inattention and hanged herself. Her maternal family is preparing to file a lawsuit to seek justice for her.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Opposition to Special Business Tax: The Suzhou Finance Department has scheduled the implementation of the special business tax starting on July 1st. Qian Bingjun has been dispatched to Suzhou to prepare for the collection. Industries such as bamboo, wood, oil, and beans in Shanghai, Kunshan, Changshu, and Wuxi have jointly telegraphed the Finance Department and various ministries of the National Government, requesting that it be difficult to accept. Industry leaders here held a meeting at the County Chamber of Commerce on the afternoon of the 4th, deciding to telegraph the ministries to stop the implementation due to the hardship of Suzhou merchants.</p>
<p>Editor-in-Chief of Da Bao Sentenced to Three Years: Su Rui, the editor-in-chief of Da Bao, and Shi Xin were arrested by the 60th Division Headquarters on the 3rd. Shi Xin has been released on bail by the Suzhou press, as he is usually peaceful. Su Rui has been sentenced to three years in prison and was sent to prison immediately.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Actively Handling Disaster Relief: At the current County Representatives Congress, county representatives Jiang Yi, Hu Huiqing, etc., pointed out that the county suffered a severe flood last autumn, resulting in no grain harvest, coupled with consecutive failures in silkworm farming. During the winter and spring, the area was also affected by the war, causing financial stagnation and farmers being unable to borrow money. As a result, some committed suicide, while others incited rice robbery. At this critical juncture, disaster relief is urgently needed. Therefore, they separately proposed seven or eight proposals on disaster relief to the Congress. It was resolved that the presidium be responsible for the treatment and to request party and government organs and local organizations to establish a disaster relief committee to actively engage in disaster relief. The following seven relief measures were also stipulated: (1) Allocate over 10,000 yuan from the agricultural bank's flood relief fund. (2) County public offices should earnestly solicit donations from local wealthy households for relief. (3) Petition for exemption from wheat rent. (4) Telegraph local relief organizations to request aid. (5) Send letters to charitable organizations inside and outside the province to solicit donations for relief. (6) Raise funds through theatrical performances in various theaters to supplement relief. (7) Actively organize price stabilization. After the resolution was passed, the presidium of the Congress, Li Tiping, Xu Yongji, Chen Tongshou, etc., contacted County Magistrate Chen to discuss relief measures. County Magistrate Chen also believed that the matter should not be delayed and should be implemented immediately. He contacted gentlemen in the city such as Yang Hanxi, Cai Jian San, Qian Sunqing, Chen Zhanru, Rong Desheng, etc. The results were very satisfactory. After several rounds of consultation, all parties in the county will be able to concentrate on the enthusiastic relief efforts to begin.</p>
<p>Exemption of Business Tax on Cocoon Industry: The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce previously stated that silk cocoons had failed for many years, and this year's cocoon harvest was extremely difficult. The government is trying to find ways to provide relief, and a special request was made to the provincial government to exempt this year's cocoon market business tax to alleviate commercial hardship. Yesterday, a reply was received from the Finance Department stating that the cocoon industry in the province had declined severely, and since there are special circumstances, it should be handled flexibly. Permission has been granted to temporarily suspend the collection of the cocoon industry business tax in the province for one year to relieve commercial difficulties, and business tax bureaus in various counties have been notified.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Sets Mid-Month Opening for</h3>
<p>Secondary and Primary School Curriculum Standards Committee</p>
<p>The delayed publication of curriculum standards... may be decided. In addition to the Party Ideology course, which will be organized and compiled by the Central Training, the curriculum standards for secondary and primary schools and kindergartens will be drafted by experts hired by the Ministry of Education starting in October of the 17th year. By August of the 18th year, the draft and arrangement of the kindergarten and primary school curriculum standards were completed, and the Ministry of Education ordered the standards to be provisionally implemented as a trial in various provinces and cities. Schools were designated to research and experiment, and the deadline for opinions was set before June of the 19th year for the Ministry of Education to use as a reference. After the provinces and cities conducted research and experiments, they requested the Ministry of Education to extend the agricultural deadline. The Ministry extended the trial research period for one year, with a deadline of June of the 20th year to report the results to the Ministry. Provinces and cities such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Beijing, Shanghai, Zhuanre, and Jilin, as well as experimental primary schools, have submitted opinions to the Ministry. In the 20th year, after collecting various opinions, the Ministry of Education reorganized the "Secondary and Primary School Curriculum Standards Drafting Committee" into the "Secondary and Primary School Curriculum and Equipment Standards Compilation Committee" to study and revise the standards. By the end of July, the review of the primary school and kindergarten curriculum standards was completed, and all resolutions were passed. After being organized by the Standing Committee, it was originally scheduled to be approved and promulgated by the Ministry at the end of August. It has been almost a year now, and the standards have not been published for a long time, causing disappointment in all quarters. The reason for this delay is that there have been frequent changes in the Ministry's deputy ministers in recent months. Each deputy minister has his own original ideas regarding the curriculum standards. Some advocate for cautious consideration, while others advocate for large-scale reduction in order to adapt to China's simple rural society. As a result, the approval and promulgation procedures have been delayed. On the morning of May 31st, the Ministry of Education convened a discussion meeting of department and section chiefs to address this issue, deciding to convene another meeting of the Secondary and Primary School Curriculum and Equipment Standards Compilation Committee in mid-month to resolve the dispute over the curriculum standards.</p>
<p>National Teachers to Celebrate Teachers' Day Today</p>
<h3>Movement Goals: (1) Improve Treatment, (2) Guarantee Status, (3) Enhance Self-Improvement</h3>
<p>On June 6th of last year, over 300 colleagues in the education circles of Beijing and Shanghai, for the purpose of improving the treatment of educational personnel, stabilizing their status, and enhancing their self-improvement, designated this day as Teachers' Day and held the first celebration ceremony at the Central University in the capital, creating a grand occasion for a time. Over the past year, the number of supporters in the education circles of large, medium, and small schools across the country has been very large. Although the Ministry of Education has not stipulated this event in the school calendar, it also believes that the intention is very profound and allows teachers in schools across the country to voluntarily gather for commemoration on this day to arouse the nation's attention to the education industry. The Ministry of Education has also expressed its approval. This newspaper, having received many articles about Teachers' Day from colleagues in the education circles, will now publish them as follows:</p>
<h3>A Message to Compatriots on Teachers' Day</h3>
<p>Shao Shuangqiu</p>
<p>Oh, my dear compatriots, which of our compatriots has no children? Who does not want them to receive a complete education in school, so as to create useful talents? We in the education circles have humbly shouldered this important responsibility and have worked diligently. We have always focused on improving teaching, hoping not to fail the expectations of our country and society. However, judging from the circumstances in which we find ourselves, even if we want to do our best to fulfill our due mission, I am afraid it will be of no avail. I would like to sincerely present one thing to my dear compatriots. Only when there is no worry about food and clothing can one concentrate on one's job. Only when life is guaranteed can one dispel concerns about the future. Only when there is no fear of dismissal can one have long-term plans. Only when there is ample leisure time can one be self-improving. Today, the salaries of us in the education circles are meager, making it difficult to support a family of eight. If we encounter disasters, our livelihood is immediately cut off. The weak are scattered in all directions, rolling in the ditches. The strong take risks and encounter criminal penalties. All kinds of tragic situations are witnessed by the world. Moreover, people are not made of iron, so how can they avoid illness? After being absent from work for a long time, their salaries are cut off. Unfortunately, if they die of illness, their funerals are desolate, and their wives and children are cold and hungry, with no one to care for them. Countless misfortunes are unspeakable. Their status is low, equivalent to being hired and fired at will. It is commonplace and not considered offensive. The dignity of the teaching profession has been completely swept away. The duties are arduous, and their minds and bodies are exhausted. After retiring, they are tired and weary. They sigh and lament that life is hard. Given these circumstances, even if we want to concentrate on our work, dispel concerns about the future, make long-term plans, and strive for self-improvement to live up to the expectations of our country and society, how can we achieve it? How can we achieve it? We in the education circles, for the sake of maintaining the foundation of the country and seeking the happiness of our compatriots' children, have repeatedly run around and appealed, demanding to improve our circumstances. However, even though we have shouted until our voices are hoarse, those in power have turned a deaf ear, and society has not offered a helping hand. Maintaining education is just empty talk, and real support has become a fantasy. Since higher salaries cannot be granted by the authorities, and strikes cannot be tolerated by the public, today the circumstances of us in the education circles have reached a dead end. If we are not willing to starve to death, we can only unite and rise up to save ourselves. Therefore, there is the initiation of Teachers' Day, the purpose of which is nothing more than three goals: to improve treatment, to guarantee status, and to enhance self-improvement. On the occasion of the commemoration, I would like to represent the educational personnel of the country and make the following requests to the government with the utmost sincerity. I respectfully ask compatriots across the country to unanimously support us, so as to promote its realization in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>(1) Quickly raise funds to restore schools and all educational institutions that have been suspended. (2) Effectively guarantee the salaries of educational personnel and pay them monthly without delay, discounts, or forced donations. (3) Please have experts formulate treatment standards for educational personnel and effectively guarantee their implementation. (4) Please have experts formulate "Educational Personnel Guarantee Laws." Currently, it is necessary to issue an order throughout the country that, regardless of whether they are newly appointed or old, personnel who are dismissed without cause may file a lawsuit. (5) Reduce the workload of existing educational personnel and provide various opportunities for them to advance their studies. (6) Revise the school teachers and staff pension and consolation regulations and effectively guarantee their implementation. (7) Establish a monument to nameless teachers in the capital to show the country's respect for teachers.</p>
<h3>A Message to Colleagues in Education on Teachers' Day</h3>
<p>Hu Duyi</p>
<p>Our country has always respected teachers, so among scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants, the teaching profession is ranked first, because teachers are considered to be knowledgeable and moral people who should be respected and admired by society. In fact, this fallacy of respecting teachers has unknowingly reduced the responsibilities of teachers by a large margin. Therefore, the proper functions of teachers have not been easily brought into play. In other words, this respect for teachers is clearly telling us teachers that we only need to put in effort in books and work in schools, and that other things are not things that we teachers should ask about. This first-class, noble education circle has turned our nation into a lifeless state. The self-preservation of educators and the occupation of educational rights by a few elite elements are really caused by this erroneous view of respecting scholars. Now we know that education is life and school is society. Education is to seek the welfare of the masses, not a luxury item for a few people to occupy. Therefore, teachers must be close to the people, and schools must use society effectively. Then, the functions of teachers and the efficiency of education can only be developed and reached one day if the meaning and value of education are properly formulated. Then, teachers are the property of society and the country and should receive special treatment from society and the country. Therefore, we should say that respecting teachers is because they are laborers who strive to build society, not because they have knowledge and morality. We must know that if teachers have knowledge and morality but cannot be applied to society and the country, why should we necessarily respect them? I think that when we advocate Teachers' Day, everyone should understand this meaning. Because teachers are laborers who build society and the country, they deserve special treatment from society and the country. The purpose of establishing Teachers' Day is to arouse social respect for the status of teachers and increase the treatment of teachers. But at the same time, it is also to remind teachers to shoulder the responsibility of building society and the country and to fight against any forces. The special treatment that the people give us teachers is for us to work hard for the people's construction. This is the first meaning that teachers should understand when advocating Teachers' Day. Finally, there are two more meanings that teachers should work together to achieve. The first is the issue of teacher qualifications. For the sake of the efficiency of our own work, we further hope that the government will actively and quickly formulate complete teacher training institutions. The broken state of the teacher education system is really not a way to encourage teachers and value education. Actively try to clarify the staff of the school education work and strictly ban teachers who do not take education as a lifelong career. This is indeed the second thing that teachers should automatically work hard to do. Since we recognize that new education is education for the welfare of the masses and education is for the construction of society and the country, then the permanence of educational work is the most important condition for educational efficiency. We educational teachers should of course have a stable position. But shouldn't all educational work, such as educational administrators, etc., also have a stable position? In recent years, the complete lack of security for educational administrators, which changes with the situation, has not been the main reason for our teachers' displacement. Therefore, Teachers' Day is also a driving force to arouse attention to educational administration and to guarantee the independence of educational administration. Therefore, we hope that the government will actively implement the specialization of educational administration to create a permanent education profession and passively eliminate politicians and bureaucrats who control educational administration and use education for political purposes. This is the third meaning that we should understand when advocating Teachers' Day. As for the issues of teachers' treatment, status, and self-improvement, these are of course the major goals of advocating Teachers' Day, because many colleagues in education have already talked about them, so I will not repeat them.</p>
<h3>Why Do We Stipulate a Commemorative Day?</h3>
<p>Li Buqing</p>
<p>Our need to stipulate a Teachers' Commemorative Day is not to advocate for teachers, but really to plan for the country. This day contains the meaning of a new national life. Now, I will present three reasons.</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of teachers: The current evils in politics are directly caused by warlords and politicians. Fundamentally, they are all caused by people who have received education, either assisting in tyranny or turning a blind eye. This is a responsibility that teachers have always had to bear. To make each teacher clear of responsibility, pay attention to self-improvement, and establish oneself and others, it is not enough to achieve the goal by improving treatment and guaranteeing rights. It is necessary to clearly express a meaning of public opinion from the entire society, so that they feel that they have an unshirkable responsibility and do not shirk it, and so that they receive a mysterious comfort that doubles their efforts. Therefore, the stipulation of Teachers' Commemorative Day is more profound and meaningful than the Christian Sabbath.</p>
<p>Second, from the perspective of society: China has always valued scholars, originally considering them to be knowledgeable and virtuous people. Since scholars have been exclusively regarded as a ladder to wealth and power, scholars have not become scholars. But today, the situation is even worse. Besides bureaucrats and active-duty soldiers, wealthy merchants and big businessmen occupy the most important position in society. Recently, workers and students have also been able to gain superior power in organizing groups. Only teachers are not in the sky, not in the field, and not members of the working class. Because they are not laborers, they are dismissed as parasites. Joining the students is past their time and they are dismissed as old-fashioned. They are called excellent elements, but if they do not have party membership, they lose their leadership qualifications. Almost, they have no independent rights among the people. The people of the country talk about social reform every day, but they have canceled the central figures of society. Imagine what kind of country it will become. To correct our mistakes, we must adopt the original emphasis on scholars in order to restore the national spirit. Therefore, by stipulating Teachers' Commemorative Day in imitation of Labor Day, social concepts will change and the atmosphere will naturally shift.</p>
<p>Third, from the perspective of politics: The government of sages and the government of Zhang Youfang have all become past terms. They have been used as much as possible by ambitious politicians and no longer have any value. What we hope for in the future is a scientific government. All organizations and facilities of this government are based on true facts and correct ideals. All officials, large and small, are built on specialized academic knowledge, which is the ancient legacy of the combination of officials and teachers. The so-called "scholars are excellent, then they become officials; officials are excellent, then they learn" cannot be divided into two parts. The reason for the failure of past tutelage was that they were uneducated and violated the flow of getting the world on horseback and governing it. The intellectual class has simply become imperial products. Instead of empty disputes over constitutional government and still taking the old path of false democracy, it is better to practice education and transform politics and academics into one furnace. If stipulating Teachers' Commemorative Day indicates that the mentor emphasizes learning as the foundation of the country, then politics formed by academics can gradually achieve the goal of the world being in harmony.</p>
<p>Although what I have said does not include all the meanings of Teachers' Commemorative Day, it is necessary to stipulate a Commemorative Day as soon as possible, based on the three reasons for the country. Teachers, arise!</p>
<h3>Teachers' Day Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Lu Jiye</p>
<p>"Why do teachers have a festival?"</p>
<p>A guest came to ask me just as I had left class, alone in my room, tired. Hearing his words, I suddenly answered him, saying:</p>
<p>"Is not May 1st Labor Day? Is not April 4th Children's Day? Is not March 18th Women's Day? Laborers, children, and women all have festivals to celebrate each other. How can we teachers not have a festival?</p>
<p>The position of teachers in society is like that of doctors and lawyers. The sick know to consult doctors, and litigants know to seek legal advice from lawyers. Therefore, doctors and lawyers devote their lives to their duties. We teachers exert our strength and labor our minds to nurture talents for society and the country. Our contribution is no less than that of doctors and lawyers. I hope that everyone will understand our efforts, appreciate our loyalty, and entrust their children to us with peace of mind. Then they will know that the reason why teachers are teachers today is to use this festival to show the true situation. How can we teachers not have a festival?</p>
<p>A common saying says that teaching is like sitting on a cold bench. Knowing that the bench is cold, one still sits on it. This is the spirit of teachers. How can we comfort the teachers who sit on cold benches? This is the responsibility of society and the country. If society and the country truly know their responsibility, then teachers will surely sit in peace forever and not slack off. If teachers do not slack off, then there will be no progress in the country's education, and the country's affairs will not decline. I hope to express our wishes through festivals. How can we teachers not have a festival?"</p>
<p>Before I finished speaking, the guest stood up suddenly, stretched out his arms, and echoed, saying:</p>
<p>"How can we teachers not have a festival?"</p>
<p>The guest left, and I wrote it down in a book. May all 300,000 teachers in China enjoy this Teachers' Day on June 6th. May all 4 million teachers in the world enjoy this Teachers' Day on June 6th. And I sing for it, saying:</p>
<p>Teachers' Day indirectly seeks a permanent solution to world peace.</p>
<p>Teachers' Day directly seeks to promote and carry forward the cause of education.</p>
<p>The country will become stronger because of it, and society will become purer because of it.</p>
<p>All of us teachers, do not forget this sixth day, do not forget this June.</p>

During leisure time after work, over tea and wine, they have also invariably used the situation of the tennis world as material for conversation. The reporter will now report the beautiful news of this season's tennis scene to the readers, which is colorful and quite interesting. This news is from a conversation between the reporter and Mr. Lin Baohua, a major tennis player in our country. The details are recorded below, which I believe the readers will be happy to hear.</p>
<p>The Issue of Qiu Feihai's Arrival in Shanghai Regarding Qiu Feihai's arrival in Shanghai, this newspaper previously reported on it once. The reporter asked Mr. Lin again yesterday. According to Lin, Qiu and Yu (Lin Baohua referring to himself) have already won the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club's Open Doubles Championship for two consecutive years. Two trophies, one is kept by Yu, and one was taken to Singapore by Qiu. This season's competition is about to begin, and the trophy should be returned. This trophy can only be kept by the champion for one year. The winner's name is engraved on it, and it must be returned to the club the following year. Therefore, it is certain that Qiu Feihai will return the trophy. Therefore, Qiu's arrival in Shanghai is no longer an issue. I have already sent a letter urging Qiu to set off immediately to participate in various competitions. Around the end of the month or the beginning of next month, we should be able to see Qiu Feihai on the Shanghai tennis court again.</p>
<p>Lin, Jiang, etc., Participate in Mixed Doubles The mixed doubles championship competition of the Lawn Tennis Club is about to open. It is found that Chinese people have only participated in this competition once, which was in the 17th year of the Republic of China, the second year after Lin Baohua came to Shanghai from Australia. Lin partnered with Miss Shi Qiluo De of England to win the championship, and Chinese women have never been involved, probably because their skills are too immature. This year, Lin Baohua and Mrs. Mann Lee teamed up to join, and Jiang Daozhang partnered with Miss Tao Leijie Hansheng, a famous female basketball player from the Western Youth Red Team. Their participation should attract the attention of our country's ladies. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Record of Striking the Bell at the Ancient Temple (10) (4) Not Removing the Courtyard Grass, the Husband of the Studio, Sixteen</h3>
<p>After eating a large meal, we returned to Wu's mansion and chatted for a while. Young Master Wu then invited us to the Great World to play. Old Mrs. Song insisted on visiting the park and said that such a place as the Great World was not suitable for country people. I thought, why is it not suitable? There must be something strange inside. I finally made it to the city for the first time; how could I not</p>
<p>go and see for myself? Old Mrs. Song's purpose in saying this was nothing more than to prevent us from going to the Great World. Little did she know that this statement instead aroused my excitement, making me want to go even more. Brother Chunsheng was also a little eager. Old Mrs. Song finally succumbed to our soft pleading and went to the Great World with us. Everything here was something I had never seen before. Old Mrs. Song was always somewhat dissatisfied, especially with those playboys and modern ladies. She was grumbling, criticizing each one she saw, tearing them to shreds. Although I did not agree with her attitude, I really learned some invaluable knowledge from her conversation. About a丈 away in front of me, a lady was strolling. I saw that she had accidentally dropped a handkerchief on the ground, so I shouted, "Whose handkerchief fell?" Just as that lady was turning to look at me, I heard a shout from behind, "Zhong'er!" Old Mrs. Song continued, "That's a prostitute! A gigolo! A gigolo! What are you bothering him for? She deliberately dropped her handkerchief to entice you to greet her. I'm telling you, this bad place is not suitable for country people. If it weren't for me protecting you here, you would have fallen for a big trick today, followed her home, had your silver turned into nothing, your clothes stripped off, and been beaten black and blue, holding your head as you returned to the countryside. If someone asked, you would say you fell and got hurt, right?" I understood some of Old Mrs. Song's words. I really felt embarrassed. My cheeks flushed red. I had to defend myself. I said, "In our countryside, when we see someone lose something, we always tell them. Why is it that in the city, if someone loses a handkerchief, they're a prostitute, and the person who tells them gets beaten?" Young Master Wu chimed in, "He meant well." Old Mrs. Song said, "Zhong'er is our best child. I know he meant well. I'm just saying these things to warn him to be wary of bad people. In short, this kind of place is best avoided by country people. My old, outdated opinion is:</p>
<p>'The Great World</p>
<p>The Small World</p>
<p>Seven Oddities and Eight Wonders</p>
<p>Doesn't Teach People Well, Makes People Bad'"</p>
<p>I couldn't completely agree with Old Mrs. Song's opinion. There were good things in the Great World, especially those mirrors that caught my attention, turning me into a Seventy-Two Transformations Sun Wukong. Strange! What's the principle behind this? I have to ask the teacher. I must find out the reason.</p>

<h3>The Gold Market Fluctuated Frequently Last Week</h3>
<p>Fluctuations of Twenty-Two Taels and Three Mace The gold market last week was quite chaotic and unpredictable, with wild waves often fluctuating by as much as ten taels. From the initial opening of 718.5 taels on Monday, a large amount of US dollars flowed out, and England, France, and other countries repeatedly reported increases in the silver market. Then, due to the June 1st account settlement holiday for money shops, the gold market was also closed for one day. On Thursday, it suddenly fell to 701.5 taels. The storm on that day created a difference of more than twenty taels. The short sellers quickly covered their positions, immediately pushing it to 720 taels. By the next day, it had turned from weakness to strength, reaching a high of 723.8 mace. However, people were confused and felt that the international economic conference and other issues were too complicated, causing turmoil in the market. It hovered around 720 taels, and finally seemed to soften to 750 taels and change. The entire week had a 回顧 of 22 taels and 3 mace. Comparing it to the previous Saturday, it continued to fall by 2 taels and 6 mace. As for the price of British and American silver and the Shanghai market's British and American exchange rates, they both rebounded, while the domestic market generally pulled British flat and American loose. It is estimated that British continues to rise against the US.</p>
<p>0.875 US also adds 0.25 to English, so the gold market trend seems weak, but observing the international situation, the future of gold prices is difficult to be optimistic. Currently, each firm estimates that Dalian gang and bill hedging are mostly occupied, and Qian Changxiang has more than 5,000 articles, Yifeng Yong has 3,000 articles, Run Changyu has 2,000 articles, Hengyu Dashun Yuanxing Yongyifeng, etc., all have about 1,000 articles, and Hengxing has little more. The empty parties such as Yuan Mao Yong have one thousand several hundred articles, as well as Tong Taichang Yuanda Yong Zhifeng Yong and retail investors. Dadecheng has about two thousand several hundred articles. As of last Friday, the total number of chips was more than 23,000, and the target gold price, calculated based on the US exchange rate, initially pressed 80-90 taels and then became 70 taels. The spot inventory is lacking, so the red bars initially increased by more than 8 taels and then more than 10 taels. The general situation of the past week is excerpted below:</p>
<p>The overall result continues to fall 2 taels and 6 "Monday" Large bars return to length 0.0625 American silver grows 0.125 Shilling does not move American gold grows 0.25 is the exchange rate crime rises while the internal English is tight and the American is tight, and the industry's income and expenditure are irregular. The initial opening of the target gold price in July is 780.5 taels, which is a reverse increase of 2 mace. It is estimated that the silver market is long and owing many times for 19.5 taels. Later, speculators and others sell, and there is talk of transporting US dollars to England, so it is temporarily weak and falls more than ten taels to 703 taels. After entering, there are many buyers, so it becomes ten taels and two qian. The afternoon receives 0.6 taels and 8 qian. The afternoon opens at 0.6 taels and 5 qian, followed by ten taels and 8 qian. By the time of closing, it is 0.9 taels and 5 qian, which is 8 taels and 8 qian lower than the previous Saturday. The entire day is turbulent, with a curve of 16.5 taels. Dalian gang and speculator Wu Qi, etc., sell out.</p>

The entire day only rises and falls by six taels and a half. Each firm's transaction is not large. Guangdong gang covers shorts.</p>
<p>"Wednesday" The large bar continues to lengthen 0.125 to 0.0625 American silver grows 0.25 Shilling extends one level American gold grows 0.375 internally also loose 惟 on June 1st the gold market is closed</p>
<p>"Thursday" The large bar is the same as before in the near future, and the distant future grows 0.0625 American silver grows 0.125 Shilling American gold does not move internally tighter The initial opening of the target gold price is 704 taels, a sharp drop of 8 taels and 7 qian. The bar feet are not in good shape, and many sellers are seen. The sudden drop is to 701.5 taels. Fortunately, the empty party is eager to resist the empty, and the exchange market also挺 rushed out 720 taels for 23 taels. The afternoon receives 20 taels and 3 qian. The afternoon is 20 taels. However, the situation is very flat, once 18 taels and 6, then 22 taels and 6, closing at 20 taels and a half, which is 7 taels and 8 higher than the previous day. Before and after, there is a 回顧 of 21 taels and a half, which is also said to be huge. The Dalian gang went out first and later the Guangdong gang Hengxing Yifeng bought a thousand several hundred. It is heard that Fuyu Daidi bought three to four thousand by some bank, etc., and the lack of cash ultimately makes the market's sharpness also .</p>
<p>"Friday" The large bar frequently rises in the opposite direction for four days, shrinking 1.25 to 1.875 American silver shrinks 0.375 Shilling American gold does not change internally slightly longer the gold market initially opens flat at 720.5 taels and it is heard that the US dollar is transported to France and large households sell out, so it becomes 16.5 taels. Suddenly, Hengyu Fuyu, etc., did not enter, and a series of six or seven taels became 26.8 (the largest of the week). Because the United States intends to participate in the silver meeting, it drops to 18.5 taels. The afternoon receives 19 taels and 7. The afternoon is 19 taels and 2, once 17 taels and 3. The price is 20 taels and 2 qian by closing, which is slightly smaller than the previous day by three qian. The price rises and falls by 7 taels and 3 qian throughout the day, hovering around 720 taels. "Saturday" The large bar does not change, and the distant future is longer 0.0625 American silver grows 0.125 Shilling does not change The domestic market is English level and American loose. The gold market is still flat, but the difference is only four taels. The opening price is 718.5 taels and then drops from 19 taels and 2 to 15 taels and 2. The income and expenditure of each firm are different. The closing price is 15 taels and 7, which is a continuation of the previous day down four and a half taels. The high and low prices of the British and American silver markets and bill target gold are listed in the table below:</p>

<h3>Securities, Bond Market Improved Last Week</h3>
<p>Active Buying, Prices Rose by Two to Three Yuan or More</p>
<p>Lively Market, Transactions Exceeded 28 Million</p>
<p>The bond market situation of the Shanghai Chinese Business Securities Exchange this week (from May 30 to June 4) is quite lively. The total turnover for the week was 382,300 yuan, including 72,000 yuan in consolidated tax, 68,200 yuan in finance, 53,500 yuan in the 20-volume issue, 48,190 yuan in demobilization, 37,000 yuan in customs, 19,000 yuan in disbandment, 18,000 yuan each in goodness, 14,000 yuan in customs duties, and only a few thousand yuan in other issues. The market situation is quite optimistic compared to the previous week. Market sentiment is showing some activity, and buying and selling are very lively. However, observing the market transactions, the June term accounts for the largest proportion, while the July term, although also open for trading, has very few transactions. The total turnover for the week is only 300,000 yuan. The daily transaction situation for the entire week shows that Thursday had the highest turnover of 510,000 yuan, while the other days were around 470,000 to 480,000 yuan. The last day of the weekend was relatively clear, but still had more than 4 million yuan. The total transaction volume was 28.46 million, which is more than 17.3 million higher than the previous week, including 5.94 million yuan in salt tax, 5.18 million yuan in consolidated tax, and more than 3.965 million yuan in the 20-volume issue, 3.591 million yuan in the 50-customs issue, 3.055 million yuan in the 19-goodness issue, 1.995 million yuan in the disbandment issue, 1.805 million yuan in the 19-customs issue, and 1 million 960,000 on Disbandment and an additional</p>
<p>460,000 others more clearly. Customs Duties amount to 810,000. Consolidate 6% amounts to 545,000 and 96 Public Bonds amount to only 115,000 and the Shanghai Municipal Public Bonds spot suddenly traded 2,300 yuan to the effect that the situation inside each Bond was good over the past week when the situation was good, the Japanese army had already retreated from Shanghai, the south was able to see the hope of peace, and the government was striving to eliminate the red real estate was gradually recovering, so even though the northeast was still mired in Japanese chaos and there was no hope of a temporary solution, the popular mood had changed from before and investments and buying became more active. Moreover, it was the time for various industries to settle their accounts at the end of the quarter, cash was concentrated in this port, and it was difficult to use it, so investing in bonds was inevitable. This is why the buying sentiment has turned smoother and market prices have been steadily rising. In the first hour on Monday, the biggest gains were made, with most bonds rising by one to two yuan or several cents. The market situation on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday was peaceful, but prices were rising faster than supply prices, and the daily trading was stable and rising. However, the amount was only around three or four cents until the last two days of the weekend, when the buying sentiment gradually weakened and slightly shrunk, but the results were quite large. Among them, the current stock of demobilization rose by four yuan and six cents, and the six-month period also rose by three yuan and a half. The other benefits are about two yuan. It is certain that the situation in the Bond Market has changed, but in terms of the current diplomatic situation, it is still not possible to be too optimistic. The high and low price increases and decreases of each bond over the weekend are listed in the table below (unit yuan)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Flower, Last Week's Yarn Tendering Very Slack</h3>
<p>Southern Port and Sichuan Gang Actively Buying Spot</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation at the beginning of the week showed a trend of weakness and falling. Due to the sharp drop in foreign cotton, buyers were panicked. However, the Southern Port and Sichuan Gang's demand for spot yarn continued unabated, and a certain large factory shipped spot goods directly to various places for sale. Therefore, some of the bottom goods were not thick, so the yarn market was still strong, falling and then rising again. However, the world yarn market is sluggish, and the price of 20-count yarn in Shanghai is dozens of taels higher than that of a certain country. In this situation, some people tend to short sell. As for actual sales, except for the Southern Port and Sichuan, there is very little activity. The Yangtze River and North China are filled with Japanese yarn, and the sales of Chinese yarn are greatly affected. It is said that Japanese factories in Shanghai are actively promoting yarn sales, with considerable profits from cheap cotton. The yarn market turned weak at the weekend, and spot sales felt slightly sluggish. Moreover, the cotton market was flat, and most people felt that the low price of raw materials fundamentally loosened. As a result, the market rapidly trended downwards. However, the current yarn inventory is thinner than before and can be maintained temporarily. Judging from the world trend, the prospects are less optimistic. Guest gangs bought a total of 6,449 bales throughout the week. The industry bought 230 bales, and the market fell by one or two taels. The number of successful bids for yarn totaled 61,300 bales. The number of bales purchased by each gang is listed below:</p>

<p>Last Week's Cotton Tendering</p>
<h3>A Powerful Falling Trend Discovered</h3>
<p>Local Cotton Consumption Plunges into Tragedy</p>
<p>The cotton market, which had been brewing for a long time, experienced a sharp drop last week. The possibility of a decline existed. Calculated based on the spot price of American cotton, the silver price was around 24 taels. The cost of transporting it to Shanghai was 6 taels per shoulder. Buyers made long positions in the belief that the local cotton inventory was low. Unexpectedly, the price of American cotton fell for two consecutive days. The lowest price for July was 5 cents, a new low not seen in a hundred years. For a time, the situation in the business community was fearful and many were short-selling in panic. At the same time, a trading company's goods collected in Zhengzhou and Shaanxi arrived in Shanghai, but the factories had no need for them. Moreover, the prices of American and Indian cotton fell sharply, and there was nothing that could be done. They had to sell large quantities in the futures market, which made the falling trend even more severe. The market opened down one or two taels on the second day. On the third day, it rebounded with American cotton by four or five cents. The market sentiment was still weak on the weekend, and general spot traders were still short-selling. The low price for the July contract for tendered cotton was 30 taels and 6 qian. In reality, the local cotton market is in a state of extreme tragedy. The biggest reason is that the price of foreign cotton is too low, and most foreign factories are full. Currently, the inventory of Indian and American cotton in Shanghai warehouses is 130,000 to 140,000 bales. According to a survey by Gao'er Ting Foreign Firm, it is about 150,000 to 160,000 bales. The existence of such a large amount of foreign cotton in Shanghai is rare in history. Therefore, most people are looking to break the 30-tael mark for local cotton tenders. It is found that a certain yarn factory in Ningbo and cotton merchants in Ningbo are the largest buyers. The actual number of accounts in the exchange is 59,100 dan. The two gangs' purchases account for about two-fourths. Bao Fang Mao Yue Company will realize short-selling of about 23,000 dan. Therefore, fundamentally speaking, it is still difficult to avoid a dramatic change in the era of old cotton. The price of tendered cotton is down 1 tael and 45 qian from the previous week. The total number of transactions for the week is 161,300 dan. However, the latest news from American cotton is that it has risen by 20 pounds, and the market may rise by two or three qian when it opens tomorrow. However, the relationship with the rise and fall of gold prices is also significant. The spot cotton purchased by each manufacturer is recorded below.</p>

<h3>US Cotton Rebounds Twenty Points</h3>

<h3>Silk and Tea: Last Week Tea Market - Red Tea Firm, Green Tea Quiet</h3>
<p>Last week, the tea market in this port saw the arrival of over 30,000 chests of red and green tea from various foreign firms. The transaction volume of each type of tea varied greatly, and the overall situation could not be considered very optimistic. The total transaction volume for the week was over 17,260 chests of Keemun, Fuliang, Jiande, Ningzhou, Wenzhou and other red teas, as well as Luzhuang and local Ping-shui green teas. Among them, Keemun and Fuliang red teas were highly sought after by British tea merchants due to the low inventory in Britain and low opening prices in Shanghai. Jardine Matheson was consistently interested, and Jardine Matheson also searched for large quantities at the weekend. The transaction was most active. The top-grade goods from Southern Keemun were opened at 220 taels, and the market was quite firm. However, the trend of green teas from all regions was extremely unfavorable. Since the news of the low opening price of Japanese tea in the previous week reached Shanghai, British tea merchants had become more cautious. Even the extremely important Chun Mee green tea was ignored. This sluggish situation was beyond the expectations of ordinary tea merchants. As a result, Chinese merchants had to greatly reduce their prices in order to open up the market. It was not until last Thursday that Jardine Matheson and Jardine Matheson and other firms opened Chun Mee tea in Tunxi for 115 taels, which was 40 taels lower than the opening price, and the Wenzhou Chun Mee tea dropped by 20-30 taels. The transaction gradually became lively. However, the market in Wuyuan East Road was always deserted due to the fact that the French firms were not interested in the white-tipped tea. However, there were some transactions in Zhen Mei and Xiu Mei teas, and there were no major changes in the market situation.</p>

<h3>Chen Mingshu</h3>
<p>Yesterday Telephoned Central Government to Resign</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu, the Minister of Transportation, telegraphed the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission yesterday, requesting to resign from his positions as Minister of Transportation and member of the Military Affairs Commission. The original telegram and separate letters to Lin Sen, Wang Jingwei, Chiang Kai-shek, and others are recorded below.</p>
<p>Resignation Telegram: Submitted because of difficult times, exhaustion of energy, and a candid statement of the following circumstances. I earnestly request resignation. I, Mingshu, have been deeply self-reproach since leaving Guangdong, and I have been living in foreign countries. I believe that assuming responsibilities requires sufficient talent and cultivation. If I act rashly and recklessly, I will ruin the situation. Considering the national crisis, the central government issued strict orders urging me to return from Japan. I immediately went to Jiangxi to suppress the soldiers, and then there was a movement for unification and peace. I, Mingshu, based on my personal and geographical relationships, went to work for it. After experiencing dangers and changes, I am now a member of the Ministry of Transportation and also a member of the Military Affairs Commission, responsible for military affairs. My responsibilities are increasing, my energy is decreasing, and I am at a loss. I am always worried and troubled, and I cannot help with the difficulties. This will only delay the country and harm my body and mind. I can only resign from all public positions and isolate myself from personnel affairs to punish myself for the past. I will diligently study and encourage my future service to the country. My desire to serve the country is long-term, and my determination to resign is firm. In addition, the Ministry has been in disarray since June, and I am delaying the position as if walking on thin ice. All of this is due to my sincere self-reproach. Perhaps my advancement and retreat will affect the central government, and there will be a lot of dissatisfaction. However, the foundation has been eroded, and there is no energy left. I am unable to save myself. I am deceiving others and deceiving myself. Using archery to obtain animals is like the enemy destroying the country first. Self-examination is very clear. Moreover, I have investigated the history and modern European and American political lives. It is necessary to have a certain period of rest or seclusion to cultivate knowledge or to engage in activities to understand social needs. My advance and retreat are not in vain. Although I am mediocre, I have dedicated myself to the country. I hope to follow the sages and not be left behind. Sincerely, I am determined to resign and request retirement. After my request is granted, I will hide in the countryside, away from the noise and friends, hoping to cultivate my mind, increase my knowledge, and prepare for future use. If approved, I will be grateful for all I have been given. I respectfully request that I be allowed to resign from all my positions as Minister of Transportation and member of the Military Affairs Commission, and that suitable personnel be selected to take over. I am waiting for orders respectfully.</p>
<p>Letter of Resignation: Chen Mingshu, Minister of Transportation, has recently been passive and has submitted his resignation and no longer asks about politics. Now I have obtained his resignation letter and a letter to Lin, Wang, and Jiang as follows: Chairman Zichao, President Jingwei, and Committee Member Jieshi: Recently, I have felt that I have no grasp of my body and mind. Looking back at my past actions, I am filled with shame. I am no longer able to participate in politics. I know that this will make my colleagues feel uneasy and hurt you. However, after thinking again and again, I have concluded that I cannot save others and cannot save myself. In the long run, I will mislead myself and the country. Therefore, I will resign. The current social atmosphere is becoming increasingly impetuous. People compete to cover up their mistakes and seek pleasure in private. After repeatedly thinking about it, I have decided to retire. The current social atmosphere is becoming increasingly impetuous. People compete to cover up their mistakes and seek pleasure in private. Or, my resignation may be viewed in the same way, and I will not be ashamed to be called clean. However, I am self-conscious and frivolous, and I like to attack the shortcomings of others. This kind of mistake is somewhat different from the customs of the time. People are suffering because they do not know their own sins. After I resign, I am afraid that the environment will change and people will have different opinions. I want to ask for funds to travel abroad, but I think that foreign customs are different. It is better to return to my hometown. I can live in the countryside and get along with the poor, so that I can be free from the world and gain more knowledge. I will devote myself to my body and mind and recover from my illness. All the criticisms and ridicule in the world will not be allowed to enter my heart. The current situation is like what Chuanshan said, "It is too late to regret the harm done to oneself, and to save it is to cause a flood." I am willing to change my mistakes and plan for future effects. The resignation is enclosed, and I respectfully request that it be approved. I am very grateful for your kindness. Chen Mingshu, June 4th.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Road Construction Beyond Boundaries</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Reaches an Agreement</p>
<p>Japanese Residents in Shanghai Panicked</p>
<p>The Japanese Government Publicly Opposes</p>
<p>China United Press, May 5, local news: Japanese residents in Shanghai were panicked to hear that the issue of road construction beyond boundaries was about to be resolved and that all police and political power would be returned to China. Key Japanese figures gathered to discuss countermeasures. The Japanese consul told the Japanese residents that the Municipal Council could not make a unilateral decision and that the case must be submitted to the Consular Body for resolution. The Japanese consul decided to oppose the road construction, but there is no treaty basis for the issue of road construction beyond boundaries. What legal basis will the Japanese side use to oppose the Municipal Council is noteworthy.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, May 5: Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Government's negotiations with the Municipal Council on the return of administrative and police power over road construction beyond boundaries in the Shanghai Public Concession to China, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received an official telegram on the matter. The Japanese government believes that the Municipal Council will not recognize anything that hinders the safety of the Concession. If the security of road construction beyond boundaries is handed over to the special police of China and the administrative power is returned to China, the Japanese government will absolutely oppose it. However, according to the Japanese interpretation, the political power of road construction beyond boundaries in the Public Concession is currently under discussion by the Consular Body in Shanghai. The Municipal Council cannot act alone.</p>
<h3>Shutdown of Entire Town of Zhenru</h3>
<p>Head of Defense Corps and Others Falsely Accused of Kidnapping</p>
<p>Corps Members Huang Chungeng and Fu Zhongmin Arrested</p>
<p>Yesterday (May 5) at 8:00 AM, the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, acting on a kidnapping case, went to the Zhenru Defense Corps to arrest the Corps Leader Wang Shouyu and the Team Leader Zhou Xilian, among others. However, since Corps Leader Wang and others were all out on official business, only Corps members Huang Chungeng and Fu Zhongmin were arrested. Afterwards, all the shops in the town went on strike because Corps Leader Wang and the arrested Corps members Huang and Fu were all local patriots who were determined to stay out of legal trouble. From yesterday afternoon, the entire town went on strike and publicly elected representatives to petition Wang Binyan, director of the Shanghai North Defense Corps Office, and Hong Lanxiang, the municipal councilor of the district, to find ways to rescue them. Yesterday, a certain gentleman visited Municipal Councilor Hong Lanxiang and asked about the reasons for the arrest of Huang and Fu and the rescue situation. According to the representatives of the town's merchants, Shen Songge, who had served as the chairman of the town's maintenance association under the Japanese military forces, suddenly disappeared a few days ago, or his wife falsely accused the Defense Corps of kidnapping him. As for the facts, it is still unknown. As for the rescue situation, I personally went to the Municipal Public Security Bureau with Wang Binyan at 5:00 PM today (May 5), but did not meet Director Wen and the head of the department in charge. I also went to the Organizing Committee of the Defense Corps, but there were no responsible personnel because it was Sunday. Tomorrow, I plan to visit Mayor Wu and Director Wen to inquire about everything and find ways to rescue them.</p>
<h3>Rampant Maritime Bandits</h3>
<p>Tragic History of Fujian Merchant Ships Robbed</p>
<p>After Fierce Battle with Patrol Boat</p>
<p>Four Survivors Detail Various Circumstances</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd, a customs patrol boat engaged in a fierce battle with pirates near the Sheshan Lighthouse outside Wusongkou while inspecting the ship documents of a sand barge. Four patrolmen were shot and killed by the pirates on the spot, and three were seriously injured. The details of the situation were previously reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the pirate ship was originally a Fujian merchant ship that was seized by pirates. The ship owner and crew were on board at the time, and four people jumped into the sea and rowed to the Sheshan Lighthouse in a small boat, where they were rescued. They were brought to Shanghai by the customs marine patrol boat Haixing yesterday. The details of the circumstances before and after the ship was seized are recorded below.</p>
<p>Merchant Ships Travel To and From Yantai The four brothers Yu Diyi (name), Yu Dier, Yu Disan, and Yu Disi from Fujian Dongchong have a Yu Shunxing merchant ship company. They own a large merchant ship (not a sand barge) with three hundred sails that rely entirely on wind power and have no oars. Yu Diyi died many years ago, and the company's affairs are managed by the third and fourth brothers. The ship is named Jinfengshun and is managed by the second brother, who hires twenty-three crew members. The business is to carry goods from Dongchong to Yantai and then carry goods back from Yantai to Dongchong. This is done twice a year. The main goods carried are porcelain and wood. The crew's wages are very low. In addition to food and lodging provided by the shipping company, each round trip earns ten yuan, and the actual annual wage is only twenty yuan, so their lives are very miserable.</p>
<p>Pirates Board and Seize the Ship On the fifteenth day of the third lunar month of this year, the ship was carrying goods to the Sansha sea area of Fujian when a sand barge suddenly approached. The shipowner and crew did not pay attention at first, but unexpectedly, when the sand barge approached the ship, a large group of bandits jumped out, each holding long spears, box guns, etc., and forced the ship to stop. At this point, we had no choice but to be captured. The bandits all jumped onto the ship, and the ship they were driving was allowed to drift away. There were a total of forty-four pirates, fully armed, and their clothes were mostly made of silk and satin, but they all wore short clothes and no long clothes. They spoke with a Taizhou or Huangyan accent and were quite aggressive. The leader was about thirty years old and ordered his men to quickly prepare food as soon as they arrived on the ship. The ship was traveling a long distance and carried more than twenty dan of rice. The crew members had no choice but to obey.</p>
<p>Send Ransom of Five Thousand The bandits finished eating and the leader ordered his men to take the shipowner Yu Dier out for questioning, as if in a court of law. The bandit leader immediately demanded five thousand yuan to redeem the ship, otherwise the shipowner and crew would be shot to death. Yu did not dare to resist and ordered two crew members to row ashore to get the money. However, the place was far from the company and it would take a long time to travel back and forth. The bandits were very impatient and threatened to shoot Yu every day, forcing Yu to deliver the money early. Yu replied that the road was far away and was beaten with the butt of a long gun all over his body. The pain Yu suffered was indescribable. It was not until the sixth day of the fourth lunar month that the two crew members sent the ransom of five thousand yuan in full. Unexpectedly, the bandit leader ordered the two crew members who sent the money to go ashore and wait in Shipu, Fujian. In the future, Yu's ship would be sent to them. The two crew members believed it to be true and rowed ashore to return to the company to report, so that they could send people to guard Shipu to retrieve the ship.</p>
<p>Bandits Roam at Sea After Yu's ship was seized, the life on board was extremely funny. The bandits did nothing on the ship and enjoyed roaming the sea every day. The three meals a day were the responsibility of the crew member Weng Dangxin (one of those rescued and came to Shanghai). Because there were many bandits, the rice had to be cooked two or three times for each meal. There was very little vegetables, only the small salted fish (called fish roe by the Fujianese) prepared on the ship. After the bandits finished eating, the crew members would share the leftovers. However, they could not eat their fill every time, because the bandits had limited rice on the ship and were afraid that it would not last for long, so they deliberately reduced the food for the crew members, and the crew members were not allowed to sleep. The most pitiful thing was Weng Dangxin, who cooked the food. If the bandits were slightly unhappy, they would use the excuse that the cooking was not good and beat Weng with the butt of the gun. This happened three or four times a day without interruption. Weng had no way to complain and had to endure it. From this, we can see the brutality of the pirates.</p>
<p>Kidnapping of a Sand Barge Owner After the bandits seized Yu's ship, their second deal was in Huanao North, outside the port of Ningbo. At that time, a Ningbo sand barge that caught yellow croaker was working when the bandits drove Yu's ship to the scene. Twelve pirates, each carrying a long gun, jumped on the fishing boat and searched it. They immediately kidnapped the shipowner Wang Yulan onto Yu's ship and ordered the crew of the fishing boat to quickly prepare six hundred yuan to redeem him. After saying this, the bandits set sail and fled. They threatened Wang severely and demanded money urgently. Wang replied that he did not have such a large amount of money and was whipped immediately. After the beating, he was forced to help with the work on the ship.</p>
<p>The Situation of This Fierce Battle On the morning of the 2nd of this month, the bandits drove Yu's ship to the waters of Sheshan outside Wusongkou and parked. At about 9:00 AM, they encountered a customs patrol boat and sent a small boat to Yu's ship to check the ship documents. The bandits took the initiative to strike first and opened fire on the patrol boat. The casualties on the patrol boat side have been detailed in previous reports, while two bandits were killed and many were injured. At this time, the crew members of Yu's ship took advantage of the fierce battle between the two sides and jumped into the sea one after another. The bandits actually shot and killed three people. The shipowner Yu Dier saw that the good opportunity could not be lost again and also took the opportunity to escape to the customs boat. Unexpectedly, in an instant, he was shot and killed by the bandits. The bodies of the dead were all abandoned in the sea. The bandits, unable to fight for a long time, set sail and fled.</p>
<p>Those Who Escaped Were Rescued In addition to the three crew members who were shot and killed by the bandits, there were also the cook Weng Dangxin, the crew members Lian Jinfa and Zheng Maoyong, and the yellow croaker boat owner Wang Yulan, who was kidnapped for the second time. Lian, Zheng, and Wang grabbed the tow rope of the small sampan at the stern of Yu's ship, while Weng lay in the small sampan, so they were all able to survive. After the bandits escaped, the four of them rowed the small sampan towards the Sheshan Lighthouse. At that time, the four of them were hungry and had no choice but to drink sea water to satisfy their hunger until about 3:00 PM, when they rowed to the lighthouse. The four of them went ashore and it happened that the lighthouse keeper knew Wang Yulan, so he immediately provided the four of them with food and clothing. They stayed overnight in front of the tower. The Haixing patrol boat arrived at the tower the day before yesterday and took the four of them to Shanghai. Before leaving, the lighthouse keeper gave Wang three yuan for travel expenses, and gave Weng and the other three nine yuan each because they were far away in Fujian. After the Haixing wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, the customs water patrol station sent Chinese detectives Sun Agui and Xue Silin to take the four of them to the police station for questioning. After questioning, they were ordered to stay in the police station temporarily. After the head of the police station questioned them this morning, the decision would be made. According to Weng and others, the rice left on the ship when the bandits escaped was not enough for two meals, and there were still fifteen crew members on the ship who were forced to escape with the bandits because they did not have time to escape. It is said that Weng and the other four, except for Wang, who is from Yong, are all Fujianese. The names they take are very strange. For example, the shipowner Yu Dier and his four brothers are named after numbers, and the name of Weng Dangxin is also rare.</p>
<h3>Important Letter on Relief for the War Disaster in Jiading</h3>
<p>Reply from the Relief Association to Chairman Gu of Jiangsu Province</p>
<p>Gu Zhutong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, and others inspected the war zone and accepted the request for relief from representatives of disaster victims in the Northeast Gate of Jiading. He immediately wrote to the Jiading War Disaster Relief Association to quickly distribute the funds allocated previously. Now, the letter of reply from Yang Weiyu, Chairman of the Jiading War Disaster Relief Association, is as follows: I have just received your letter, in which you ordered me to quickly provide emergency relief to the Northeast Gate and other places in the county. It has been found that the Northeast Gate and Loutang are the most severely affected areas in the county. In addition to distributing 30,000 yuan allocated by the government to purchase seeds, miscellaneous grains, and goods for small-scale industrial and commercial enterprises, the association has also raised rice, cotton seeds, and a portion of cash, which have been distributed separately for emergency relief. However, the funds are not sufficient to build houses. I am grateful that the Shanghai citizens and local maintenance conference have decided to allocate 37,500 yuan for the construction of semi-public housing in the county. I will follow your instructions and quickly handle this matter to maintain the lives of the disaster victims (the following is omitted).</p>
<h3>Taicang War Disaster Relief Association Investigates Losses</h3>
<p>The Taicang War Disaster Relief Association in Pintang Lane Bridge has made registration and investigation the only criteria for relief since the withdrawal of the Japanese army from all the districts under its jurisdiction. Therefore, Zhu Qingzhi was hired as the director of the investigation and registration section. Detailed forms were prepared in advance, and work was started in mid-May. Investigators were assigned to each township to actively carry out the work without reservation. In just over two weeks, the household registration and investigation of the entire territory were completed. The trampling of the Japanese army has directly and indirectly accounted for 80% of the county, and hundreds of people have been killed and injured. This is truly a catastrophe unprecedented in Taicang in the past 100 years. The results of the investigation are disclosed on the left. Area 1: a total of 2,574 households, 17 deaths, 9 injuries, 40 houses destroyed. Area 2: a total of 1,784 households, 80 deaths, 26 injuries, 68 houses destroyed. Area 3: a total of 1,035 households, 78 deaths, 41 injuries, 156 houses destroyed. Area 4: a total of 801 households, 71 deaths, 24 injuries, 357 houses destroyed. Area 7: a total of 7 households, 1 death. Area 7: a total of 605 households, 6 deaths, 2 injuries, 85 houses destroyed. The above totals 6,806 households that were ravaged by the Japanese army, 252 deaths, 103 injuries, and 706 houses destroyed. Direct losses are more than 80 million yuan, and indirect losses are 40 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Baoshan County Agencies Moved Back Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County Education Bureau, Property Department, Land Registry Bureau, and other agencies temporarily moved important documents and books to Shanghai due to the impact of the war. A temporary office was set up on the second floor of 101 Zhili Road. Now that the Japanese army has withdrawn and local order has gradually been restored, the staff members have returned to the county as usual. All documents in Shanghai will be transported back to Baoshan today.</p>
<h3>Takeover Committee Compiles Report</h3>
<p>Since the signing of the agreement, the Japanese army suddenly withdrew, and it was very difficult for our side to go to take over in a hurry. For example, when Liuhuo withdrew, the Jinghu Railway in the middle was not handed over. The Shanghai police could not go to the front, and the Beijing police could not arrive in time. The Takeover Committee handled the matter quickly and appropriately, and still managed to take over on schedule. For example, the Japanese army suddenly withdrew from Miaohang and Pengpu without prior notice. If early preparations had not been made, there would have been chaos. There were many similar situations. The Japanese side also had the responsibility to wait for our side to take over, but they were slow to leave. Therefore, the Takeover Committee has compiled a report on the various circumstances of the takeover, detailing the various difficulties overcome, and published a special book to inform the people of the country and clarify the facts. The editing is now underway and will be published as soon as the draft is completed.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Appeal Association of Disaster Victims in the Zhabei War Zone</h3>
<p>The victims of the Zhabei war zone gathered yesterday at the Pharmaceutical Industry Association on Beijing Road. Thousands of people including Cen Qisheng, Zhang Bingnan, and Song Zhenyang attended. Cen Qisheng was elected as the temporary chairman. The details of the discussions are recorded below: (1) The Zhabei Charity Group was temporarily used as the office, and Guo Wei's law firm on Qipan Street was used as the branch office. (2) Cen Qisheng and Song Zhenyang were publicly elected as the temporary directors of the office. (3) Guo Wei was requested to be the legal counsel. (4) The registration office for the losses of the disaster victims was set up in the office and branch office, and registration started on the 8th. (5) It was decided to hold a discussion meeting at the Charity Group at 5:00 PM on the 7th of this month to discuss the implementation measures.</p>
<h3>Curfew Hours in Northern Shanghai Shortened Separately</h3>
<p>Huang Ming, director of the Northern Shanghai Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, shortened the curfew hours to facilitate public transportation and revive commerce as order in Northern Shanghai has gradually returned. The area west of the Southern Baoshan Road of the Jinghu Railway has been changed to 12:00 PM to 4:00 AM every day. Other areas north of the railway and other areas with special relationships will be subject to other regulations after reviewing the situation. In addition to reporting to the Public Security Bureau, the order has been issued to all subordinates for compliance, and a notice has been posted for public knowledge.</p>
<h3>No Curfew in Nanshi Yesterday</h3>
<p>Public sports field holds memorial service rescheduled The United Association of Citizens Opposing the Ceasefire Agreement and Aiding the Northeast Volunteer Army held a memorial service for the martyr Gu Zhenghong and the anti-Japanese martyrs, originally scheduled for May 30. The Municipal Public Security Bureau persuaded them not to hold the meeting during the curfew. Later, it was changed to 10:00 AM yesterday. The Municipal Public Security Bureau notified the districts to be strictly prepared because the group had not been approved by the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau, and had not reported to the authorities in advance. However, the association has now changed the meeting to 10:00 AM on the 12th, still in the West Gate Public Sports Field, and renamed it the Memorial Meeting for the Northeast Songhu Anti-Japanese Martyrs. The authorities immediately stopped the curfew after receiving the report, so the temporary curfew in Nanshi carried in various newspapers yesterday was still the same as usual.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines Refuse to Withdraw from the Huafeng Factory</h3>
<p>Negotiation Results in Requests for Instructions from Higher Authorities</p>
<p>Yesterday at around 1 PM, Japanese Navy Marine Corps Staff Officer Lieutenant Colonel Ito, accompanied by Battalion Commander Major Furuta, along with a Japanese interpreter, visited Li, the district head of the Seventh District Police Department, regarding the stationing of troops at the Rihua Yarn Factory (i.e., Huafeng Yarn Factory) on the Wusong Wenzao Road. Staff Officer Ito stated that the Navy Marine Corps stationed in the factory were originally there for factory defense and did not venture out. Now, the sentries at the Wenzao River bridge have been removed to avoid misunderstandings. District Head Li raised objections, stating that since the army had already withdrawn from the factory, there should absolutely be no Marine Corps stationed there. This situation was a violation of the agreement, and he requested an immediate withdrawal to restore the situation before January 28th. The staff officer then claimed that the stationing of troops in the factory did not pose much of a problem in terms of the treaty. District Head Li firmly disagreed. As a result, Sato said that since it was the case, he would request instructions from higher authorities on this matter, hoping for an understanding. He then left. District Head Li immediately ordered the security team to set up posts at the Wenzao River bridge and reported the incident to the Municipal Police Bureau and the Takeover Committee for investigation.</p>
<h3>Fifth District Police Bureau Prohibits Setting Off Firecrackers</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Police Bureau of the Municipal Police Bureau issued a notice yesterday to prohibit the setting off of firecrackers, stating: "It is known that setting off firecrackers is most likely to cause confusion in hearing. During this period of alert, it should be absolutely prohibited. Recently, it has been found that households in the city are arbitrarily setting off firecrackers and sky lanterns, which is feared to cause misunderstandings and disrupt order and tranquility. Therefore, this notice is issued to warn everyone to abide by it. Those who deliberately violate it will be immediately arrested and severely punished."</p>
<h3>The Nineteenth Route Army's Shanghai Office Closes Down</h3>
<p>Since receiving the order to handle the closing, the Shanghai office of the 19th Route Army has rushed to complete the affairs of each department for the past ten days. It is now learned that the office officially announced its complete closure on June 5th. However, the finance department has not been able to complete the procedures in time due to the complexity of the affairs, so personnel are still retained to handle matters and a communications office is set up in the Army Club on Jinji Road. As for the other staff, they have all gone to Beijing to accompany the large army to Fujian to carry out bandit suppression work.</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission's Reply to the Federation of Labor Unions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions has repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government, appealing to withdraw the order, in addition to sending representatives to Su, Xi, and Chang counties to contact various civil groups and go to Beijing to make a plea, prostrating themselves on the road to block the passage of the chariot, in order to retain the Nineteenth Route Army. Yesterday, the Military Affairs Commission replied, "To all comrades of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, after careful consideration of your telegram, the Japanese bandits and the Red bandits have the same anxiety to triumph. Since the Shanghai incident has come to an end for a time, the Red bandits should also be suppressed in time. Internal stability is the way to resist foreign aggression. Special reply from the Military Affairs Commission, which has not yet gone to war."</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Guangxi Circles Enthusiastically Assist the Northeast Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association has been assisting the Northeast Anti-Japanese War Volunteer Army and has sent Mr. Feng Shaoshan to Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong and other places to raise funds separately and persuade all circles to organize branch associations. Yesterday, the association received a telegram from Mr. Feng from Guangzhou, saying that he had returned to Guangdong from Guangxi and that the results in Guangxi were quite good. People from all walks of life in Guangzhou expressed their support for the organization of branch associations, and they also have considerable confidence in raising donations. As soon as the affairs in Guangdong are on track, he will set off for Hong Kong.</p>

<p>The city's industry and commerce have been severely devastated by the war, resulting in cases where they cannot be maintained, declare liquidation, or temporarily suspend operations due to the inability to turn around capital. If no measures are taken to maintain them, the prospects for industry and local security will be greatly affected. All sectors believe that the only important issue at present is how to maintain industry and commerce after the war. A reporter from Xin Sheng She specially visited Mr. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, who talked about how to relieve industry and commerce after the war. Leaders from all walks of life in the city are deeply aware of this and have established an industry and commerce assistance association to appoint specialized personnel to undertake investigation, design, mediation, and introduction. At present, many industrial and commercial enterprises have come to apply, and they are actively proceeding separately. However, the occurrence of a dispute often involves more than just this port, so they have sent telegrams to other commercial ports to jointly organize the aim of restoring the operation of stores and factories and mediating creditor-debtor disputes to avoid legal solutions.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Relieve Jiangsu Province Silk Cocoons</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry believes that measures to relieve this year's silk cocoons have been implemented step by step, but many silk factories in various counties have not yet started work, and farmers have no way to sell the fresh cocoons they have raised. They telegraphed the Minister of Industry, Chen, to coordinate relief efforts. The original telegram reads: "To Minister Chen Jun of the Ministry of Industry, this year's silk cocoon market has declined. This department has implemented various relief measures in accordance with the Shanghai agreement step by step. However, many silk factories in various counties have still been unable to start work, and farmers have no way to sell the fresh cocoons they have raised. The rural economy has been greatly affected. There have been many requests for relief. After Jiangsu Province suffered from floods and military affairs, its financial resources are meager. This matter is of great importance. It is planned to ask your ministry to coordinate relief efforts. In the face of this telegram, we cannot wait for orders."

<h3>National Goods Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>Army Commander Cai, Minister Chen, Brigade Commander Weng, and Others Participate in the Grand Ceremony</p>
<p>In view of the fact that national goods have been almost destroyed since the January 28th incident, and various imported goods have reappeared with active momentum, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall believes that various countries seem to have further economic encroachment on our major cities. The economy is the lifeblood of the country. If it is manipulated by foreigners, the pain of subjugation is feared to be a hundred times greater than being conquered by force. Therefore, it has united the four major national goods organizations in Shanghai to jointly organize the Shanghai National Goods Exhibition in order to awaken compatriots to make an early determination to jointly use national goods, so that the annual leakage of 50,000,000 yuan can be blocked by our national products. After two months of preparation, collecting products from various places and recruiting a large number of manufacturers, it has finally been completed. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at 10:00 AM today in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Grand Meeting Hall north of Tianhou Palace. Order of the ceremony: (1) Play national music; (2) All stand at attention; (3) Bow respectfully to the Party and National Flag and the portrait of the Premier; (4) Respectfully read the Premier's will; (5) Moment of silence; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Representatives of various agencies deliver speeches; (8) Guests give speeches; (9) Photograph; (10) Play national music; (11) Sound cannons and raise the flag to open the exhibition; (12) Visit the exhibition. Wang Xiaolai, Ye Huijun, Chen Xiangting, Wang Hanqiang, Lu Xingzhuang, and Zhu Zhenhan are elected as chairmen, Yan E’sheng as secretary, Zheng Chengqing as general manager, and Zhu Boyuan as master of ceremonies. All office staff of the exhibition hall will be in charge of the reception. It is said that this exhibition is very grand. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Society and other agencies to send personnel to deliver instructions, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has specially sent commissioners with letters to respectfully invite Army Commander Cai Tingkai of the 19th Route Army, Minister Chen Mingshu, and Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan to participate in the opening ceremony. It is now learned that after receiving the invitations, the three important figures have agreed to attend and personally unveil the exhibition. Army Commander Cai will also write an inscription on the spot, "Promote national goods and regain economic rights," and give it to the commissioner to bring back. It is thought that this will enable our armed comrades to better promote national goods while marching in the army. At the time, the three people's speeches will not only make national goods shine, but they will also be able to give a detailed report on the Battle of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>County Agricultural Education Center to Hold Local Cloth Exhibition Opening Today</h3>
<p>In view of the increasing number of foreign goods imported in recent years, especially cotton textiles, the Shanghai County Farmers Education Center knows that at the same time, farmers' handicrafts, such as spinning and weaving, can continue to be maintained and gradually improved under the severe oppression of machine production, and new patterns are being created every day. At present, since Shanghai has been devastated by the Japanese, more and more Chinese people are aware of and ashamed to use enemy goods, and they are competing to use local cloth as the latest fashion. For example, the so-called reed mat floral cloth has become the fashion of modern girls. However, they don't know that there are more than hundreds and thousands of kinds of local cloth patterns. The center has seen this and has spent several months collecting them from all over the country. There are already more than a thousand kinds, and it is scheduled to hold an exhibition at the center in Zhuanqiao today (6th), and then rotate to various districts of Shanghai County in order. Finally, a large-scale exhibition will be held in Shanghai Nanshi on June 13th. All the fabrics displayed in the venue are priced, and visitors can buy them at any time. It is said that the price is particularly low for publicity purposes, and each piece of cloth will not cost more than one yuan.</p>
<h3>Hongkou Merchants and Residents Request the Public Works Bureau to Ban Hidden Traitors</h3>
<p>Also Informs the Taxpayers Association of the Consistent Stance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens United Association Hongkou District Branches and the Business Associations of North Xizang Road, East and West Huade Road, Suzhou Road, East Broadway Road, Hanbury Road, Yangshupu Road, Haining Road, Ai’erjin Road, Yinxiang Road, North Jiangxi Road, and other 20+ groups have jointly sent letters to the Public Works Bureau and the Chinese Taxpayers Association, requesting that traitors hiding in the Hongkou District be strictly prohibited. The letter's contents are recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Public Works Bureau:</p>
<p>We are writing to you today, as per the report from the shops and stores in our respective districts. Ever since the Japanese army withdrew from Zhabei, after the land was subsequently received by our side, the traitors who were relying on the power and strength of the Japanese army to act as accomplices have gathered in small tea houses and inns located along areas such as Yinxiang and Huade Road, Zhoujiazui Road and the East Youheng Road. Please would you relay our concerns to the Public Works Bureau, to take action against these traitors in order to ensure peace and security for this region. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, the unconscionable and depraved traitors have taken advantage of the chaos to incite arson, murder, and general disturbance. The past saw them taking refuge in Zhabei. Currently, it would seem they have congregated around the Hongkou region; this situation is unacceptable. For the security of the shops and stores of this region and for the preservation of the peace in this region, the Public Works Bureau should investigate this matter strictly. Failure to do so will bring grave consequences. Therefore, we have sent you this letter for your kind attention and action.</p>
<p>To the Taxpayers Association:</p>
<p>This association has been informed by the stores in the Hongkou region that ever since the Japanese army withdrew from Zhabei, traitors who relied on the might of the Japanese army have gathered in small tea houses and inns located along areas such as Yinxiang and Huade Road, Zhoujiazui Road and the East Youheng Road. Such a situation is a dangerous one. Aside from informing the Public Works Bureau to act against such a situation, we seek your cooperation in jointly advocating for actions to be taken.</p>
<h3>Nanshi First District Re-Registers Households</h3>
<p>The Nanshi First District Headquarters and the shops and residents in the jurisdictions of the First, Second, and Third Offices have mostly lost their household registration certificates due to the relocation for refuge during the January 28th Shanghai War. At present, the situation is peaceful and business has resumed. However, the police officers sent by the district offices to check household registrations have been punished.

All shops and residents are notified to quickly re-register their current population before the 15th of this month. Do not wait and see. There are also investigation household registration forms available. It is hoped that all shops and residents will fill them out within the time limit for summary and submission.

<h3>Shanghai Health Bureau Notice: Everyone Must Know the Key Points of Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>In view of the early outbreak of epidemics in the city this year, and that the weather will gradually get hotter and more likely to spread, the Municipal Health Bureau has selected the simple and easy-to-implement key points of epidemic prevention that everyone must know and issued a notice to inform everyone. The notice is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Notice: It has been found that this city has suffered from war, and people in various districts have been displaced, their physical fitness has been weakened, and they are more susceptible to epidemics. Economic difficulties and hygiene defects are inevitable. Every summer and autumn, cholera and typhoid fever are severe. Infectious diseases are more likely to spread and cause harm. Moreover, many people have been found to be suffering from cholera in Zhabei since April 26. The following matters that citizens should pay attention to and implement are hereby announced as follows: (1) Regardless of gender, age, or child, everyone should get a vaccine because after the injection, a kind of antitoxin can be produced in the body. If germs invade, the antitoxin in the body can eliminate them. Although it is not certain that you will not get sick, the illness will be alleviated and easier to treat. The Bureau has now sent personnel to give free injections without charging any money. It is hoped that citizens will advise each other to get vaccinated. This is a matter of protecting your own life. Do not misunderstand and hesitate. (2) Raw water and everything washed with raw water, rinsed with raw water, and made with raw water must not be eaten because raw water often contains germs that cannot be seen with the eyes alone. If germs are mixed into the stomach, serious infectious diseases such as cholera and typhoid fever will occur. Therefore, strict precautions should be taken to prevent raw water from entering the mouth. Do not be careless. (3) Flies are pests that transmit cholera and typhoid fever. The reason why epidemics are easy to spread in summer and autumn is (1) because everyone likes to eat raw and cold things, and there are too many opportunities for raw water to enter the mouth; (2) because flies breed, and germs adhere to flies and spread. It is hoped that citizens will work hard to eliminate harmful flies. (4) Always sprinkle stinky medicine water or lime water in places where there is dirt and the risk of defecation to reduce the development of germs and the source of bad odors. The above matters are the minimum requirements for preventing epidemics in summer and autumn. The matters are very simple, do not cost money, and can be implemented by everyone. The Bureau is responsible for protecting the health of citizens and has made recommendations in previous years. Now, due to the suffering of war, the various districts are particularly worrying. I will give you careful guidance again to do your best to prevent and jointly stop epidemics. This is extremely important. Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau</p>

The municipal government has previously expressed its willingness to send a letter to the court first, and it should be urged to handle it immediately; (4) (Omitted) The above points will be submitted to the Executive Committee meeting for discussion tomorrow.

The Anhui people find this kind of investigation impossible to trust. In addition to convening a meeting of fellow villagers to discuss the matter, we request that another commission be appointed, together with impartial Anhui gentlemen residing in Shanghai, to conduct an impartial investigation to give account to the disaster victims.

Because the association is actively engaged in complicated negotiation procedures, it is unable to respond to each inquiry individually. Therefore, it is publishing the progress of the handling of the case in the newspaper to inform all policyholders as follows: (1) Please ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send a letter to inform the Chamber of Commerce to convene a formal negotiation between the two parties. (2) Send letters to various organizations requesting assistance. (3) Representatives have been appointed to begin negotiations with Chinese insurance companies. (4) Personnel have been sent to investigate the facts of the fire damage in the disaster area.</p>
<h3>Tobacco and Alcohol Industry Groups Telegraph the Ministry of Finance to Request Instructions on License Tax Issues</h3>
<p>The four tobacco and alcohol industry groups in the city held a joint meeting yesterday regarding the transfer of license tax collection to the province and the increase in tax rates, which would increase the burden. They decided that if the tax is collected in the autumn, they would express unanimous opposition by sending an express telegram: "Respectfully to Finance Minister Song Jun, Nanjing: Reading the Shanghai branch newspaper, we learned that the Jiangsu Province tobacco and alcohol license tax has been transferred to the province for collection, which has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and will begin in the autumn. We are extremely shocked. The tobacco and alcohol license tax is a national tax and has always been directly collected by your ministry. All tax rules are the same in all provinces. Even if the collection is transferred to the province, it should be formally announced by your ministry to ensure verification. Moreover, how can the tax rules be arbitrarily changed? We are unable to suspend doubt as to the true nature of the situation. We hereby telegraph and request your Excellency to promptly grant instructions to clarify the truth and dispel the doubts of the public. Respectfully, Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association, Sauce and Wine Industry Association, Liang Shao Wine Industry Association, Sauce Garden Industry Association." (Small print)</p>
<h3>The Tobacco Exchange Association Appeals for the Return of Confiscated Soda</h3>
<p>Requests that the Tax Bureau Clarify Stamp Responsibility</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday: "Recently, member Shen Wancheng wrote to us stating that our shop had three boxes of Shessing Soda from Xiexin Store Manager stored there. One box was entrusted to our shop for sale, and two boxes were returned goods deposited in our shop by other households. Because the soda was delivered without stamps, on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, four officials from the Stamp Tax Bureau, including Huang Mo and Gong Mou, came to the shop to investigate and said that we were intentionally evading taxes. All of the soda was taken to the Tax Bureau without a receipt. When the soda truck arrived, it did not have stamps, so how could we affix them? The Stamp Tax Bureau has not published the soda stamp tax regulations for this year in the newspaper in advance, and we have not received any notification from the bureau or any announcement from your chamber. Therefore, we do not know the truth. Now that the war has just ended peacefully and business has not yet recovered, the market is depressed and the suffering of merchants and citizens is already difficult to bear. How can we be subjected to further harsh treatment? Therefore, we are reporting to your chamber and asking you to quickly forward our request to the Tax Bureau to understand the difficulties of the times and have compassion on merchants and citizens, quickly return the soda, and directly negotiate with the store manager so that our business can be secured. We would be eternally grateful. In addition, member Chen Delai reported that in the afternoon of this month, our shop had two boxes of Zheng Guanghe Soda in stock, but the stamps were prepared but not affixed. When Inspector Yang and others saw them, they said that we were evading taxes and took the soda without giving a receipt. Please verify. According to our investigation, soda is manufactured by the factory, and stamps should be directly collected from the factory. This is in line with the method of collecting taxes at the factory. Tobacco exchange shops are retail in nature and have no responsibility to affix stamps. Now the bureau does not collect taxes at the factory and does not strictly ban the import of goods without taxes. Instead, it suddenly sends personnel to inspect retail shops and confiscates goods for any un-stamped merchandise, saying that we are in violation of regulations. Moreover, soda in the concession does not need to be stamped, while soda in the Chinese territory must be stamped. This is clearly discriminatory and unfair treatment. Furthermore, before the inspection was carried out, no announcement or notice was published in the newspaper or sent to the industry association. Moreover, after confiscating the goods, no confiscation certificate was given, and no fine was issued. This smacks of harshness and many malpractices. There are thousands of shops in our association that also sell soda. If such harsh treatment is allowed, how can we bear it? We have informed all of our shops to suspend soda business until the matter is resolved and return all soda in stock to the original factory. We will resume business after the Tax Bureau clarifies the measures to avoid being harassed. In addition to this, we are sending this special letter, requesting that your chamber uphold justice and quickly argue for our case and show compassion for the difficulties of merchants. Please send a letter to the Tax Bureau to return the confiscated goods from the two shops first and clarify that the responsibility for affixing stamps lies with the factory, publish the announcement in the newspaper so that everyone knows. If the Tax Bureau intends to favor the factory and exploit small merchants, our association will never recognize it and will resolutely stop business. We still hope to receive a reply so that we can inform everyone."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Seeks Loans for the Five-Year Plan, etc.</h3>
<p>Minister Chen Came to Shanghai and Had Preliminary Discussions</p>
<p>It was rumored that Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo contacted the industrial and commercial sectors in this city to seek loans during his last visit to Shanghai. According to sources, this is indeed the case. The loans are part of the Ministry of Industry's proposed five-year plan. The detailed measures are attached to the principles of the plan. Minister Chen's last contact was only a preliminary solicitation of opinions from the industrial and commercial sectors. It is estimated that the principles of the plan will be passed at the industrial conference to be convened in Nanjing this month, after which formal contact can be made.</p>
<h3>French Concession Pays Attention to Summer Hygiene</h3>
<p>The health authorities of the French Concession have recently paid special attention to cleanliness in the concession as the weather gets hotter. It is said that some servants used by residents of various alleys and lanes sometimes dump filth into garbage cans and sewers late at night, causing a foul odor and disregarding hygiene. Orders have been issued to street patrols to conduct strict surveillance to facilitate investigation.</p>
<h3>Current Status of Japanese Fishing Boat Encroachment</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Wang, who is familiar with the fishing industry in this city, talked about the encroachment of Japanese fishing boats in China. This began in the 28th year of Meiji, that is, 1906. In the past, because our government and people did not pay much attention, the details were largely unknown to the outside world. However, a review of the Customs foreign trade records reveals that from the first year of the Republic to the 19th year of the Republic, the total excess of imports over exports in China's foreign aquatic trade was 32,205,000 (Customs taels), with an average annual excess of imports over exports of more than 30 million taels. This is truly a major loss to the country's finances and social economy. Taking the case of Japanese hand-drawn net fishing boats encroaching in Shanghai as an example, the period from the 18th to the 27th months of the Republic was the most rampant. There were 38 fishing boats, such as the 7th and 8th Bokutsumaru, Okinawa Maru, the 1st, 5th, 10th, and 16th Hidemaru, the 3,000th Chishima Maru, the 2nd Asahi Maru, the 1st and 2nd Taiseimaru, the 2nd Takemaru, the 1st and 2nd Taidayu Maru, the 1st and 2nd Mitsuchimaru, the 1st and 2nd Shūhō Maru, the 1st and 2nd Tōyō Maru, the 2nd Ebisu Maru, the 11th and 12th Hiryomaru, the 10th and 11th Taiseimaru, the 1st and 2nd Kamogawa Maru, the 6th Hiryomaru, the 10th and 11th Akiharumari, the 5th and 6th Ohsaru Maru, the 7th and 8th Taiseimaru, and the 1st and 2nd Takemaru Seifumaru, etc. At a minimum estimate, there were 14 ships per month, averaging 28 ships per month. Assuming that each ship's fish was worth 30,000 yuan per year, the annual loss due to encroachment was 840,000 yuan. In the 19th year of the Republic, Japanese fishing boats encroached on Shanghai 172 times. From the 26th month of the Republic, more than 50 ships were imported. After the 7th month, due to the Customs restrictions on foreign ships under 100 tons, imports gradually decreased. Those imported must pay taxes in accordance with the regulations (4 yuan and 5 jiao per dan). As such, Japanese fishing boats were unable to compete with our Chinese fishing boats in Shanghai because our domestic fishing boats' fishing tax had long been exempted by the government, in order to restrict the encroachment of foreign ships and protect and encourage the development of domestic fisheries. However, Japanese fishing boats adopted various cunning tactics. From the 7th month of that year, they first transported their catches from our territorial waters to Dalian, and then transported them to Shanghai by Chinese merchant ships to evade taxes privately. After the 918 Incident last year, when the Japanese army violently occupied our three eastern provinces, the Japanese Fisheries Association planned to organize large-scale fishing companies, cold storage plants, and ice-making plants in Yingkou, Dalian, and other places with 30 million yuan, with the ambition of actively encroaching on our northeastern fisheries. As for the Shanghai area, since the January 28th Shanghai War, Japanese fishing boats have also taken the opportunity to encroach. They either landed in Wusong and transported the goods by car or barge, or sailed directly to Shanghai. In February and March, they successively transported 10,000 boxes of copper basin fish, black sea bream, red ladyfish, snake eel, and salamander (approximately 40 jin per box). Initially, the goods were for military use, and later, approximately 6,000 boxes were sold in batches. Fishing boats directly imported Ohsaru Maru, Han Maru, Fukushima Maru, and others. On June 1, 1,200 boxes were imported, 800 boxes on the 2nd, and another 800 boxes on the 3rd. The fish were mostly small yellow croaker, horse mackerel, red ladyfish, shark eel, salamander, etc., which were transported by barge from Wusong. After arriving in Shanghai, Chinese vendors were asked to promote sales for profit. Recently, it has been rumored that Japanese fishing boats want to use Chinese fronts in Shanghai to organize hand-drawn net fishing companies to evade taxes in order to consolidate their encroachment in Shanghai and avoid the attention of government authorities. The best way to prevent this cunning is to hope that the fish merchants and vendors in this city will no longer promote their sales and make a decision not to cooperate, so that they can reduce their losses.</p>

<h3>Report on Anhui Relief Efforts by the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association</h3>
<p>Distribution of the Third Batch of Funds</p>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association at No. 13 Renji Road, this city, has been working in the disaster areas of Anhui Province. With the critical period before the next harvest and dangerous signs emerging, it has recently raised funds to assist. In addition to Yicheng, Wuwei, Nanling, Wuhu, and other places that have been allocated funds for relief, more than 10,000 yuan have been remitted to Haozhou. Yesterday, a report was received from the local relief staff, which is translated below:</p>
<p>Current Needs</p>
<p>In terms of needs, Haozhou is only classified as a second-class disaster area. The investigation was quite detailed, and the relief tickets were divided into first, second, and third classes. However, in recent days, the situation has become increasingly tragic. The number of first-class disaster victims has been increasing day by day. There are a total of 400,000 people in the entire county. This is still a very conservative estimate, as half of them have not yet received relief and have no hope of receiving it.</p>
<p>Relief Situation</p>
<p>There are currently 1,000 starving people who have been taken in and provided with food and clothing in four places in the city. They are given six bowls of wheat porridge a day, and their strength is gradually recovering. Three porridge kitchens have been set up for the disaster victims. 18,000 relief tickets have been issued to the elderly, which is enough to sustain the lives of 20,000 people.</p>
<p>Financial Situation</p>
<p>Due to the early or late arrival of relief funds, we had to distribute them for the second time. We recently returned from the disaster area and distributed 4,000 relief tickets 90 li south of Haozhou, but the actual expenditure was only 6,343 yuan. The wheat seedlings along the way were very good, and the harvest is promising. This is gratifying. However, very few seedlings ripen early because they have already been harvested. The only thing that the disaster victims are eating now is tree bark, grass, and green wheat husks. This is tragic. The faces of the starving are everywhere, and there are thousands of people waiting for relief. The sound of crying is unbearable to hear. The twenty days before the harvest are a matter of life and death. I wonder if more funds will be allocated.</p>
<p>Shocking News</p>
<p>Today, I saw a sixteen-year-old youth crying. When asked why, he said that his father had starved to death, his mother and sister were too weak to walk, and he could not live alone. In addition, there are two or three hundred disaster-stricken children who have lost their fathers or mothers, or whose entire families have died, leaving them alone. It is unbearable to ask. How can we not be heartbroken by such a tragic event?</p>
<h3>The Tragic Situation of Deng County Disaster Victims as Learned by the Jisheng Association</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from Tang Zikun, Chairman of the Henan Deng County Relief Association, to the China Jisheng Association, the disasters in the county have been repeated, and the people are extremely poor. In recent years, they have been hit by bandits, epidemics, floods, and droughts. More than 146,500 people have died, and the loss is estimated to be worth more than 300,000 yuan. Last year's flood resulted in no harvest. The river broke in more than 30 places. The poor in the southwest have been cut off from food and grain. For more than ten years, the bandits have been wreaking havoc. The old and weak have been abandoned in ditches. Those who have survived have no food, no clothing, no seeds, no cattle, and the land is barren. The majority of the county is empty, and there is no way to borrow money. Last autumn, medicine and coffins were used to treat the epidemic, and the resources have been exhausted. The people are eating aquatic plants and digging up grass roots to fill their stomachs, but now there are no aquatic plants or grass roots. The market is full of tools for sale, but no one asks about them. The financial resources are exhausted when trying to mortgage land and property, and there is no one to redeem them. There are no buyers for wives and children being sold. The sound of crying is heartbreaking, and the faces are thin and emaciated. They fall to the ground and die instantly. Relatives embrace the bodies and wail, but often no one buries them, and they are abandoned on the road. The sight is unbearable. Now it is the spring season, and although the wheat harvest is approaching, the wheat has been affected by the drought and is growing without grain. There are thousands of miles of red earth, and the starving are everywhere. The plague is rising again, and the death toll is increasing. Although Commissioner Lei has issued American wheat and set up porridge kitchens, they have long been completed. Recently, Governor Liu has been suppressing bandits and gradually restoring order. There is hope for returning to farming, but the village houses are in ruins, there is nowhere to live, there are no tools for plowing, and there is no strength to cultivate. The people are exhausted, and the finances are exhausted. There is no choice but to appeal and plead to raise funds for work relief to repair water conservancy and provide agricultural loans to prepare seeds. The surviving are waiting to be rescued, and the matter is urgent.</p>

<h3>304 Ounces of Opium</h3>
<p>Hidden in the Hold</p>
<p>The water patrol team received a tip that a Shanghai ship sailing to Pinghu was smuggling opium. They immediately sent patrolmen to search the ship and found 304 ounces of opium in the hold. Because the opium was found in the hold, it was assumed that it was brought on board by the ship, so the sailor Chen A'er was detained and sent to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Death of Two Chinese and Indian Watchmen</h3>
<p>The Suspects Completely Deny the Charges</p>
<p>On the 24th of last month, several hundred yuan worth of objects were lost on the British merchant ship (Aryan Baptis Mara). The Chinese sailors Chen A'fa and Yao Zirong were suspected. The ship's watchmen, Yu Jiarun from Jiangbei and Sheeksni from India, asked them for questioning, but they denied the charges. Subsequently, the shipowner dismissed Chen and Yao. On the night of the 29th, the two watchmen suddenly disappeared. The next day, their bodies were found in the Huangpu River, having been pushed into the water and drowned. Chen and Yao are suspected of murder. The Jianghai Water Police Station officers Sun Agui and Sun Xiangshou, and Tang Jiazhen, went to Chen A'fa's residence at No. 321 Yongcheng Lane, Juhua Ji Road, and reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station, requesting assistance in the arrest. The police chief dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Chen A'fa and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. According to the police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin, the case was requested by the water patrol police station to assist in the arrest of the defendant, and the circumstances were stated. However, for Chen A'fa, considerable evidence must be presented, etc. According to the water patrol police station detective Sun Agui, the defendant completely denied the charges. Judge Qiao Wanxuan ordered him to be returned to custody and rescheduled for further investigation.</p>

The French police chief dispatched several detectives to assist in the operation. However, the bandits had already fled and disappeared. No one was captured, but three Mauser pistols, one handgun, and more than 100 rounds of ammunition were found in the house and taken to the police station as evidence. The escaped bandits are being strictly pursued.</p>
<h3>The Dispute Between Water Police Arresting Thieves and Assaulting People</h3>
<p>Cai and Gu's Indictment to be Heard Today</p>
<p>Merchants and Citizens of the Entire Town Petition for a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>On the 29th of last month, Cai Huanwen, a merchant in Meilong Town, Shanghai West, was suddenly arrested by Luo Daokun, the captain of the Third Team of the Water Public Security Bureau, along with Inspector Chen Younian and more than 20 detectives, who crossed the border and made an indiscriminate arrest. They fired their guns to intimidate and severely beat Cai Huanwen and the farmer Gu Arong. The security team of the town and the police station of the municipal public security bureau jointly sent the inspector and seven others, together with Cai and Gu, to the Third Branch of the Sixth District and then to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is now learned that after being interrogated by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Cai and Gu were released and went to the local court to file an indictment, which is scheduled to be heard this morning. It is said that Cai Huanwen's injuries are still slight, but Gu Arong's skull was broken by the water police and he is in critical condition due to excessive bleeding. He is currently being treated at Nanyang Hospital.

<h3>Russian Dancer Obtains Money Through Fraud</h3>
<p>Two Dance Halls Deceived</p>
<p>A Dancer Disappears</p>
<p>Russian dancer Luo Ping Si Jia Ya (transliteration), aged 27, residing at No. 728 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, had a husband who ran a beauty shop specializing in facials for women. On the afternoon of the first of this month, Luo was introduced by someone to Gu Shi Na Zhuo Fu (transliteration), the owner of a Russian Marin Troupe living in Room 2, No. 157 Rue Sainte Marie. They signed a contract for Luo to dance in Hankou, with a deposit of fifty yuan and an agreed departure date. However, on the evening of the same day, Luo also signed a contract with Hua Si Duo Huai (transliteration), the female owner of the F克斯刀 Russian dance hall at No. 198 Route Ghisi, agreeing to dance in Qingdao, receiving a deposit of seventy-five yuan, and also agreeing on a departure date. When the time came, Luo Ping Si Jia Ya was nowhere to be found. Unable to locate her, they realized that Luo had deliberately defrauded them and reported the matter to the French police station, requesting an investigation. On the morning of the 4th, at around 10:00 AM, Western detective Yang Gao Fo Si Ji arrested Luo. The following day, she was sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Wu Fang Lian examined her and the police station lawyer, Fei Xi Zhen, explained the case. Charges were filed under Article 363 of the Criminal Code, and the two plaintiffs stated the circumstances of the defendant's fraud. When questioned, the defendant Luo Ping Si Jia Ya admitted to signing contracts with the plaintiffs and committing fraud. She claimed that she had spent all the money and requested leniency in order to find a way to return it. Judge Wu, after reviewing the confession, sentenced the defendant to a fine of one hundred and twenty yuan, or one day of imprisonment for every two yuan if she was unable to pay.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over Stolen Emerald Jewelry</h3>
<p>Zhou Jiang Shi, a woman from Suzhou, kept fine emerald jewels at home, rarely showing them to others. However, her daughter worked at a home industry cooperative and became close friends with Chen Wu Shi, a female worker at the same factory. The young and naive daughter revealed the treasures hidden at home to Chen Wu Shi. Chen Wu Shi's husband, a jeweler, devised a plan to have the daughter take out the jewels to verify their authenticity. The daughter immediately stole more than ten pieces of emerald jewelry and gave them to Chen Wu Shi. The next day, Chen Wu Shi claimed to have sold them for only five yuan. The daughter told her mother, who checked and found that items worth over one thousand yuan were missing. They demanded the return of the items, but Chen Wu Shi refused. Zhou Jiang Shi reported the matter to the Second District Police Station, who arrested Chen Wu Shi and handed her over to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yi Peng Accused of Embezzling Large Sums of Money</h3>
<p>Zhang and his Wife Repeatedly Fail to Appear</p>
<p>Plaintiff Willing to Bear Responsibility for the Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zhang Yi Peng, a native of Hunan who is currently the Acting Director of the Military Council of the National Government, borrowed a large sum of money from Cheng Lin Pu, the owner of Changsha Bai Ji Hardware Store, while serving in the Hunan Mint in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. The debt remained unpaid for a long time. When Zhang became the Acting Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, Wu Li Shan, the manager of the store, requested repayment of the old debt. Zhang lured Wu with the promise of the position of Director of the Hankou Public Works Bureau, but nothing came of it. Recently, Cheng's son, Cheng, and Zhang and his wife, who currently reside at the Jing An 聖因 in the French Concession of Shanghai, hired a lawyer to file criminal charges against Zhang and his wife for embezzlement in the First Special District Court. The court has held three hearings, but the defendants have failed to appear, preventing the proceedings. On the afternoon of the previous day, Judge Qiao Wan Xuan held another hearing and summoned the defendants, but they again failed to appear. According to the report from Chinese police officer No. 1281, who delivered the summons, the second defendant (Zhang's wife) was at home but refused to appear alone because her husband was still in Nanjing. The plaintiff's lawyer, Xi Ya Fu, stated that the defendants' repeated failure to appear was a clear sign of contempt of court. He argued that if this case had been filed in a court in the interior, he feared that the first defendant would not only fail to appear in court. He asked why the second defendant, who was not a member of the military, had also failed to appear repeatedly and requested that a warrant be issued for her arrest. Judge Qiao then briefly expressed his opinion, saying that after carefully examining the facts alleged by the plaintiff, the case appeared to be a civil debt dispute with no indication of embezzlement. He questioned whether the plaintiff's decision to file criminal charges was for ulterior motives. Cheng Dao, the plaintiff, immediately stepped forward and claimed that the defendant had indeed committed embezzlement and that all evidence would be presented at the trial. He stated that he was willing to bear the responsibility for false accusation if the charges were proven untrue. Judge Qiao then adjourned the hearing to a later date to allow for the defendants to be summoned again.</p>
<h3>The Excitement of the Grand Silk and Satin Sale at the Hua Hua Company</h3>
<p>The newly established Hua Hua Company at the intersection of Shiliu Road and San Ma Road has collected a large quantity of silk and satin from major famous factories and war zones, and began a grand sale yesterday. Before the company opened at around 9:00 AM, ladies from all walks of life were already standing at the door, eager to be the first to buy bargains. It was reported that the business volume in the morning had reached more than two thousand yuan. In the afternoon, the weather improved, and because it was Sunday, the number of customers increased even more. The company's employees were overwhelmed with serving so many customers. All the ladies who patronized the store were sweating profusely in the crowd, which could be described as the height of a momentary sensation.</p>
<h3>Jun Long Ham Store Grand Opening, Low Prices</h3>

In order to expand its business, it has come to Shanghai and built a new building at the eastern end of Beijing and Fujian Roads to open a business department. It officially opened yesterday. At the beginning of this new opening, all southern ham and wind-dried meat are at great low prices for two weeks.</p>
<h3>Da Dong Socks Factory Joint Price Reduction and Gift Promotion</h3>
<p>Da Dong Socks Factory, both the Nanjing Road and Xiaodongmen branches, launched a joint price reduction and gift promotion yesterday for fourteen days.

<h3>Chu Min Yi's Speech on Developing the Northwest Problem</h3>
<p>The World Society and the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank joined forces. The upper layers of the商場 are generally insufficient in sunlight and air. Prolonged service in the middle of the year makes one feel significantly malnourished. Relying on weekly holidays, one can take matters of leisure to regulate. However, recreational places in the city increase expenditures. Public parks are quite interesting but the transportation fees monthly are also uneconomical. Therefore, the World Society established a 工餘 學會 (After-work Association) at 393 Foch Road in order to host the World Society’s staff and the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank’s employees from 10AM to 6PM every Sunday. In the future, they will invite various people to join as a place to nurture after work. The location is located in Shanghai’s Western suburbs. It is secluded and spacious, with excellent air. The library is indoors, the music is suspended from the Imperial Song stage, and the ball courts are well equipped. One can observe, can sing, and can be happy and improve one's body. Every week in the morning, they ask celebrities to give speeches and solicit essays, and in the afternoon, they engage in various activities that are beneficial to the mind and body. The association's first lecture (May 15) invited Mr. Li Shi Ceng, the founder of the World Society and a member of the Central Committee, to speak about the establishment of the World Society. Its main purpose is to develop the economy, strive for construction, and promote culture and literature. The plan of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank is to seek communication between economy and culture, and the importance of its mission in society and to combine the After-Work Association in order to exchange new knowledge, enjoy recreation together, and increase work efficiency. It was a very detailed enlightenment to our knowledge and profound. On May 22, the second lecture was given by Mr. Zhang Gong Quan, the managing director of the Agricultural and Industrial Bank, who said that bank employees bear a great responsibility and must pay attention to the three aspects of spiritual organization and discipline. The audience was moved. On the evening of the 30th, Mr. Chu Min Yi, a member of the Central Committee and the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, gave a speech entitled "The Problem of Developing the Northwest." First, Mr. Qi Zhi, the manager of the Shanghai Agricultural and Industrial Bank, gave an introductory speech. Then, Mr. Chu gave a speech saying that agricultural and industrial undertakings are the personal tasks of all of you, and that the development of the Northwest is especially related to the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. Years ago, I paid attention to the expansion of the Northwest. At first, I had a trip to Suiyuan, but unfortunately it was very short. But the vast land and sparse population were already visible. Last year, I went to Xinjiang again, passing through Zhangjiakou and Mongolia to Dihua, and then returned via the Siberian Railway. At the National Crisis Conference, someone proposed to make Luoyang the capital and Xi'an the accompanying capital, renaming it Xijing. After the agreement was reached, I went to Xi'an with Mr. Zhang Pu Quan and others, and then to Suiyuan and Xinjiang, making it my third trip to the Northwest. However, there is a distant Northwest and a near Northwest. The Chinese map is divided into nine parts: the Central, East, South, West, North, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest. The Northwest occupies the largest area. The near part includes Shaanxi, Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Gansu, and the distant part includes Xinjiang, which is very vast, equal to fourteen times the size of Zhejiang. Compared to the prosperous areas, the population is sparse. Zhejiang has a population of over three million, while Xinjiang only has five to six million. Moreover, travel is not easy, which is one of the reasons. Xinjiang is located in the western frontier, and transportation is often difficult, separated from the interior. The transportation of fur and food is difficult. However, it is closer to Soviet Russia. We can go to Xinjiang via the Siberian Railway in just twenty days. If we travel by large cart, it will take no less than one hundred and fifty days. If we do not go through the Siberian Railway, it will take seventy to eighty days even by train. Last year, I went to Xinjiang with the Sino-French Exploration Group, taking thirty-four days by crawler car. If the automobile road is built, it will take about twenty days. It takes three days to fly to Xi'an because we cannot fly at night. However, if we shorten the distance, we can promote the exchange of culture, harmonize the economy, and transport materials. At present, camels are still used, each carrying 240 to 300 catties. After arriving in Xi'an, I felt the importance of developing the Northwest even more. Because the land is high and there is little water, there are often disasters such as floods and droughts. Moreover, in the fifth and sixth months of the year, cold winds often blow, destroying the vitality of rice and wheat. For example, the black frost in Shaanxi recently did not fall from the sky. It was caused by a strong cold wind that killed all the wheat seedlings, resulting in a black color like black frost. These three disasters of floods, droughts, and freezes urgently need to be thoroughly resolved. The people of our country have always had the idea of relying on heaven for food, praying to gods and ghosts for rain and sunshine, exhausting all superstitious abilities. In fact, (1) Floods and droughts should be adjusted using scientific methods, such as building dikes and planting forests, and widening ditches for drainage. In modern times, our country's forests have been destroyed almost completely, and there is little replanting. We should plant as we cut, and even if it takes thirty or forty years, it will not be a big problem. The land in Jiangzhe area is low-lying and the coastline is only one or two zhang away. The tide often floods the road, and water can be found two or three feet below the ground. But the north is not like this. For example, the land in Shaanxi is almost a thousand feet away from the coastline and there is no place to accumulate water. After heavy rains, mountain floods break out and houses are destroyed. (2) There is no water on high ground during droughts, and there is no water to prepare. The lowlands also suffer from a lack of water. The best way to cure this is to plant trees extensively to adjust the air, and the short-term solution is to open rivers. The Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake in the Yangtze River have clear tributaries. The Yangtze River avoided flooding last year because of this, and the Yellow River is easier to defend because the Yellow River basin has prepared for the diversion of water. For example, Hong Kong is an island surrounded by water. The seawater is distilled into distilled water, which is called salt water turned into fresh water. However, the island's demand is frequent, and artificial procedures are slow and costly. It is better to set up reservoirs in the mountains to collect rainwater, which is like tap water. Last year, there was a water shortage and fresh water was transported from the sea, which was also a manifestation of drought. The biggest problem in Xi'an is that there is too little rainwater. The largest river there, the Wei River, has few forests and clogged ditches. Most of the water used is well water. The people of the Western City use mountain water as drinking water. In the Tang Dynasty, the water of the outer river could flow into the city, but now it is not possible. It is not because they cannot do it, but because they are too lazy to do it. After I returned to Shanghai, I heard that it was raining in Xi'an, and the local people regarded it as sweet dew. Shao Li Zi was happy when he heard that it was raining in Gansu, so politicians also rely on heaven for food, because there is politics to do when the year is abundant. The people rely on heaven, not to mention it, but society will never evolve if they rely entirely on heaven. If someone buys 500,000 mu to 1,000,000 mu of land in Jinghui Canal and adds agricultural and industrial plans, they will surely reap huge profits. Recently, the China-Foreign Relief Association has opened ditches in the area with an amount of one million yuan. It is said that before this ditch was built, the land was worth one yuan per mu. After the ditch was built, the land was worth eight yuan per mu because there was water for cultivation and the land price increased sevenfold. It is best for people to cooperate with the government to make things easy with half the effort, and the result of developing any place in the Northwest will be the same. Moreover, there is no fear that the development of wealth will not be carried out, but that we will not be willing to do it or do not know how to do it. If we do not know, we should go and do it after knowing it. If we are limited by capital, we can use fundraising methods to remedy it. In short, the greater the capital, the more profit we can get. We can get interest of two, four, and eight. If the capital is small, the efficiency is also small. Although I have the ambition to develop the Northwest, I am troubled by heavy capital such as water conservancy, afforestation, and transportation (railways and automobile roads). Now it only takes two nights and one day to go from Nanjing to Tongguan. There is an automobile road from Tongguan to Xi'an, which takes six hours. It takes only four days to get to Lanzhou by car from Xi'an. If you take a train, you have to go through eighteen stations (that is, eighteen days). The Ministry of Railways is planning to build the Tongxi Railway. There is no tap water in Shaanxi. Although it is famous for coal production, the price of coal is 38 yuan per ton, which can be said to be a strange thing. This is also due to the inconvenience of transportation. The price of coal in Beitongguan, 138 miles from Xi'an, is only four yuan per ton. How difficult is it to transport by car? Other things such as Yanchang gasoline are best for cars, but the residue is too much. After refining, it can be used. Item black oil can also be used as a substitute for coal for postal ships and machines without refining, and the procedure is simple and there is no fear of coal dust flying. Now, when we talk about developing the Northwest, we should pay attention to (1) transportation (roads, telephones, power lines, everything is included), (2) water conservancy, (3) animal husbandry, and (4) forests, so that we can talk about agriculture and industry. In terms of industry, we rely on the manufacture of raw materials. It must be like this that people can have enough food, clothing, housing, and transportation. If the politics is unstable, all industries will be depressed and banditry will increase. It is not easy to solve the people's livelihood. Therefore, without the joint efforts of the central and local governments to vigorously implement construction, there is not enough to talk about peaceful unification. It must be able to build agriculture and industry, and then peaceful unification will come uninvited. To put it bluntly, people only know honor and disgrace after they have enough to eat and wear. All prosperous things in the world can only be discussed after the people's livelihood is solved. In today's world, many countries store gold without using it, which is not enough to promote economic development. The most important thing for us today is to afforest on one hand and build roads on the other hand. Capitalists should also divide the work and cooperate to seek the welfare of the people of our motherland. The Northwest is vast and rich in resources and is closest to Russia. It is difficult to guarantee that there will be no danger of the Northeast falling. However, the Soviet Union does not adopt a military policy like the Japanese. The Chinese people turn a blind eye to it. There are only 20,000 troops stationed in the entire Northwest. If something happens, it will be too late to send reinforcements. It will take a year to transport 100,000 troops there. The Chinese people turn a blind eye to the Northwest, just like the Northeast. It is very convenient to transport troops in the Northeast, but it is more difficult to save the Northwest. Xinjiang seems to be under the control of the Central Government on the surface, but in fact it is very isolated. In the past, telegrams had to be relayed through Tibet, India, and other places, or sent by the Great Northern Company. Recently, the Central Radio Station can communicate directly with Xinjiang, which is much more convenient. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People center on the people's livelihood, which also seeks political stability so that the people can live and work in peace. Gentlemen care about agriculture and industry very much. I am very happy to discuss the problem of developing the Northwest with you. The Central Committee plans to send 100 people in ten groups to the Northwest to investigate the truth. This year, the Chinese Science Society will hold an annual meeting in the Northwest. I think they also know the real situation in the Northwest. The people in the Southeast are well-fed and well-clothed, while the Northwest is very barren. Even tree bark and grass roots are not available. It has fallen into a situation where there are nine empty houses in ten. This makes people think deeply. I often think about it and hope that you will have time to visit the Northwest to see the relics of ancient culture and how to engage in rescue and development. Chu's speech was sincere and thought-provoking. After Chu's speech, Qi Zhi gave a thank-you speech, which was sincere. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>

<h3>The True Meaning of Colors in the Mouth of a Fortune Teller</h3>
<p>— Zhan Liao</p>
<p>A Tu born with a sickle, a laborer with an axe, are now promoted as pillars on the red stage.</p>
<p>The banner of the sickle and axe crossed is flying in Soviet Russia; there is no doubt about that. I saw the Labor Day demonstration of the German "red gentlemen," with the sickle and axe banner blotting out the sun. So the power of German farmers and workers is not weak!</p>
<p>Some say, "A government organizing farmers and workers, why does it always seem like they've eaten red beans or taken red tonics?"</p>
<p>A fortune teller at a roadside stall laughed loudly, "To solve this problem, come ask me!" I saw him grinding the ink thick, licking the brush full, and wiping the powder board smooth. I saw him writing with the brush on the powder board and lecturing to the crowd:</p>
<p>"Those who work as farmers, aren't they simple-minded A Tus? The character 'red' (赤), the upper half is the character 'earth' (土); so when farmers become leaders, their color is red. The character 'hong' (紅, red), doesn't the right half have the character 'work' (工) for workers? So when workers become leaders, their color is red. When Cangjie, the legendary inventor of Chinese characters, created the characters, he already knew that the 'red gentlemen' would definitely make the 'earth old fellows' the center of politics, and the 'red saints' would definitely make the laborers the model figures of the nation, so he created this character 'red' with the 'earth old fellows' as the foundation, and created that character 'hong' based on the laborers. Cangjie's vision is far beyond mine!" I was also by the fortune-telling stall, listening to his new character explanations, and felt that it seemed reasonable, yet unreasonable. I was just about to study it with him a bit.</p>
<p>He wiped the powder board clean again, and accepted someone else's character slips, having no time to chat with me!</p>
<h3>Wonderful Plan to Kill the Enemy</h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>A dilapidated and rugged Huishan Road, long overdue for repair. It has always given people the impression of "What is the Construction Bureau doing?" Lately, after the 156th Brigade, which bravely defended Wusong and awed the world, arrived in Wuxi, this road has had a chance for revival. The day before yesterday, I went to Huishan and saw the road filled with three or four hundred soldiers from the brigade. Each one was energetic, holding an iron hoe, or carrying sand and mud, busy repairing the defects of the road. The sweat on their foreheads was dripping onto the sand and soil. Their hands never stopped moving. Some were talking and laughing, others were singing Cantonese ditties. Ah, how loyal and diligent they are. When foreign invaders come, they immediately forget their own lives and steadfastly defend the motherland. When garrisoned, they do not waste the nation's rations. During breaks from drills, they do some labor that benefits the people. Ah, they are truly respectable and lovable people's soldiers. Compared to those troops who are brave in internal wars but cowardly in defending against foreign enemies, who bring disaster to the country and harm the people, there is a world of difference.</p>
<p>Because my heart was captured by their love and respect, I stopped to watch them work, and later even talked to them. Among them, there was a platoon leader named Tang who told me about a wonderful plan to kill the enemy that he experienced firsthand during the Shanghai war. After hearing it, I admired him wholeheartedly. Now I will record his words below.</p>
<p>Since the January 28th Incident, we have been in a state of tension, and everyone was very happy. We were happy that the opportunity to kill the enemy had come, that the time to serve the country had arrived. Everyone's life was active in the flames of revolution, holding a belief in certain victory, and fighting desperately with the Japanese invaders. Once, around the evening of February 3rd or 4th, our company was near the Wenzaobang, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with a small team of enemies. Both sides suffered casualties. Later, we feigned defeat. Some comrades pretended to be shot, lying among the corpses, smearing the blood from the corpses on their faces or bodies to feign death. The enemy thought we were truly defeated, so they pursued us victoriously. When they crossed the pile of corpses, we in the fake fleeing group immediately gathered, turned around, and launched a fierce counterattack. The enemy was just about to turn their heads when they heard earth-shattering shouts from the pile of corpses. Dozens of blood-covered people suddenly jumped out, some holding knives, some holding guns, attacking from both sides, cutting off their retreat. As a result, this small team of Japanese devils was frightened out of their wits, flustered and panicked. Before long, they were all killed by us, not one of them surviving. It was truly the most enjoyable thing.</p>

<h3>The Pursuit of Flesh (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ying Ge</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Writings on the Old Capital, No. 8</p>
<p>You only need to flip through the court files, and you will be shocked by the number of rape cases in May! Yes, May is the periodic excitement period for sex, which can be seen in books.</p>
<p>Here, I don't want to drag on anything, but only talk about the May in Beijing, which, although an ancient city, is still full of human flavor.</p>
<p>Pomegranate flowers open their fire-like red eyes in the courtyards, the weather suddenly changes from mild to scorching, and there is a bit of restlessness in the scorching hearts. Especially the young and sanguine men and women, they will languidly and weakly lie on the bed in the long, dull day, feeling a subtle comfort in their hearts or bodies. This comfort, if I were to say, is the starting point of troubles.</p>
<p>In the dilapidated old capital, everything, everything shows decline, but the educational circles of the old capital are still thriving. This cannot but be said to be a fresh flower on a barren grave. Because of this, there are especially many students in the old capital, and some people even say, "It is the students who have prolonged the life of the old capital. Without them, the restaurants and apartments would be deserted and eventually close down."</p>
<p>The sanguine students, when they reach this periodic period of sexual excitement, they will naturally not be able to restrain themselves from pursuing flesh? This is very obvious and very common. By the palace walls, on Chang'an Street, in the quiet dead alleys, and in any corner, you will always see young female students, changing like fish-like curves, wearing sensual and highly stimulating cheongsams, talking and walking in groups of two or three, and behind them, there will naturally be followed an equal number of males, they tightly staring at the behinds of the women, tirelessly staring and staring, with cat-like eyes, seductive words, all symbolizing their urgent need for sex.</p>
<h3>On Thrift and Frugality to Save the Nation (3)</h3>
<p>— Written by Nie Zengjifen and Nan Qijie</p>
<p>At that time, it was the Emperor's birthday. The governors and viceroys of various provinces rushed to Shanghai to purchase various exotic and ingenious objects from various countries as tributes. The ministers in the capital were even more eager to cater to the Emperor's wishes, which influenced them so greatly. Alas, how terrible! After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, the people of the country did not learn a lesson. They did not strive for frugality to accumulate national strength. Those so-called reformers were dedicated to studying European customs, and the virtues of thrift and frugality in our country were abandoned. Social extravagance increased day by day, and decades of extravagance eventually made the ships of strong neighbors stronger and their cannons sharper, so that they would invade us. Whose fault is this? In the last ten years, the degree of extravagance has increased several times compared to the past. They imitate the bad habits of Europe and the United States, using every possible means. Male and female students mostly wear Western-style clothes. The price of socks and shoes is up to tens of dollars. Wedding ceremonies imitate the Western style. From head to toe, nothing is not an imported luxury item. Even a head veil costs hundreds of dollars. Foreign restaurants are the best place for wedding events. In short, all actions are intended to completely resemble foreigners, especially rich foreigners, and they regard Chinese clothing and state as contemptible and shameful. This poison has deeply penetrated the internal organs, and the concept of patriotism has disappeared invisibly. It is difficult to maintain the independence of the nation. The individuality of the country has died. The spirit of China's founding and the personality of the nation, though not exactly the same, are characterized by frugality. The foundation of Chinese politics and education lies in virtue and etiquette, and virtue and etiquette also return to frugality. Confucius answered Lin Fang's question about the essence of etiquette, saying, "Regarding etiquette, it is better to be frugal than extravagant." Yu Sun said, "Frugality is the common virtue; extravagance is the great evil." Therefore, frugality is the spirit of Chinese politics and education. Coveting profit and being arrogant with wealth is a common evil of mankind. All the world's disasters and crimes originate from this. Only the ancient sages of our country deeply knew the reason, so their governance and education emphasized propriety and righteousness while depreciating the rich and powerful. Confucius said, "The gentleman understands righteousness; the petty man understands profit." Mencius regarded those who diligently pursued profit as the followers of the bandit Zhi. He also quoted Yang Hu saying, "To be rich is not benevolent; to be benevolent is not rich." He also regarded merchants monopolizing market profits as inferior to scholars. Jia Yi of the Han Dynasty, as a great political thinker in China, deeply denounced the extravagance of rich merchants and powerful families, which harmed people's livelihoods, corrupted customs, and confused the etiquette system. He spoke with great pain. Therefore, for thousands of years, relying on the maintenance of etiquette and the constraints of social public opinion, it has become an invisible law that rich and powerful corrupt officials are afraid of. In the late Ming Dynasty, this style still existed. Officials who became rich and returned to their hometowns were generally looked down upon by the literati. This is indeed the unique national spirit of China. Coming to this day, with the import of European customs, especially from the United States, people respect the rich as upper-class people, praise luxury, and despise frugality. Scholars also follow suit and make speeches in support of it. The social atmosphere is greatly corrupted, and national affairs cannot be done.</p>
<p>Slowly, and the female students who are stared at, sometimes glance at them, or crisply, seemingly angrily but coquettishly scold "shameless!"</p>
<h3>Book Tribulation</h3>
<p>— Yu Jianhua</p>
<p>The cultural losses of this Shanghai incident cannot be measured in numbers. The most obvious ones are the Commercial Press Library, the Oriental Library, the collections of Yi Peiji, and the collections of Liu Shimu and Zhou Yueran. Some are unique copies in the country, some are Song dynasty editions, some were collected from abroad, and some were obtained from Southeast Asia. The lifeline of culture, the scope of which is no small, has been completely reduced to ashes by the First Emperor of Qin. It can truly be called an unprecedented catastrophe. The Patriotic Girls' School moved to Chen Yuan on Jiangwan Road last year. The flowers and trees are secluded and beautiful, and the school buildings are fresh and new. It was hoped that it would flourish, but it was also mostly destroyed this time. Principal Wei Rongwu's collection of books was stored in the library. Although they were not burned, they were in complete disarray. The owner of Chen Yuan, Deng Zhuqing, because the Jiangxi Communists hated books, transported thousands of volumes of old books collected in Nanchang to the garden in Shanghai in July last year. Unexpectedly, they were instead destroyed by the imperialists. Now, the only thing left is half of the Anthology of Poems on Objects that I borrowed. Although I am a scholar, I also like to buy books. Over the years, I have accumulated thousands of volumes. Literature and art, books, paintings, inscriptions, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, are all available to some extent. I have no other hobbies. Caressing and browsing through them is enough to please my nature and delight my mood. When the January 28th Incident occurred, because it was located in the suburbs, the traffic was inconvenient, and the news was blocked, I did not flee in a hurry until six days later. The wind and snow were on the road, my wife cried and my children wailed. After running around all day, I finally arrived in the concession, but I had no possessions. I thought that twenty years of hard work would not be enough to withstand an enemy's bomb. When the League of Nations investigation team arrived, I went with my elder cousin Ji Fan by car to retrieve them. After several twists and turns, I finally arrived at the place. Fortunately, the house was intact, and the clothes were all preserved. I was overjoyed, but because I was a teacher at the Patriotic Girls' School, I almost suffered misfortune. If Ji Fan had not known Japanese, it would have been disastrous. More than a dozen Japanese soldiers each gave him a painting, and he was able to avoid trouble. But it was close!</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Accompanying the Special Train to Drive Away Guests, There Is a False Alarm; Sitting Cold in the Yamen, Turning into Stone and Having Distant Thoughts</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Ye Zuozhang was instantly stumped by him. He immediately put away his playful expression and seriously answered him, saying that bandits should be appeased rather than suppressed, and that the militia also had great strength. I have always advocated this and determined it to be one of the greatest military and political policies. It is a pity that the local people only know how to curse me and are not willing to offer good ideas to guide and help me. But they do not know that they are all people from the same hometown. Who does not want to govern the place well? My ability is limited, my knowledge is not much, and I have no capable people to help and guide me. Naturally, it is very badly managed. It is useless to be scolded. It is better to be willing to help and guide me. When I really do not use the worthy and do not listen to good advice, it will not be too late to scold me to my face. I will not blame you either. Now that you have a very good method, I will sincerely welcome it. Please tell me. Anything that can be done, if I do not do it, you can scold me to my face as a fool. I will not blame you. An Yutian listened to Lao Ye's straightforward words and could not help but secretly admire him. He was also happy that the opportunity was not bad and that he could really meet a good patron who loved talent and understood reason. He then blurted out a set of big lies that he had been preparing at the pillow. He said that there were so many people in such and such a place, and that people had so many guns. His family had such and such a great relationship with these people for generations, and how he could summon them to obey his orders with one call. He completely blew a big bubble. At the end of the conversation, Ye Zuozhang said with great emotion: "Good. You really have guts. Let's just get together. I will leave Beijing in half a day. Please come back with me. After discussing it in detail, we can probably decide what to do. I will temporarily appoint you as a military advisor. That's all there is to it. As long as you have people and guns, are you still worried that you won't have good things to do?" An Yutian bowed and thanked him for his cultivation. Ye Zuozhang suddenly shrugged his shoulders and whispered with a smile: "It's a deal. The advisor's official affairs will be handled by the secretariat tomorrow and sent to you. But you must come with me. Bring your family along with you. An Yutian answered yes again. This conversation was considered to be over. Ye Zuozhang slightly showed a tired look and shifted his gaze to the stage. It turned out that a good opera of Yutangchun was being performed on the stage at this time. Chen Fangchun, the female impersonator who played Su San, was Lao Ye's favorite person. Of course, he had no time to take care of anything else and had to concentrate on enjoying it. Then, he heard the ushers calling out that Chief Wei had arrived and General Zhang had arrived. Several more officials with a full sense of officialdom suddenly came to a small box.</p>

<h3>Gu Weijun's Trip to Japan</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Japanese government sent a note to the investigation team, welcoming Gu Weijun's visit to Japan. On the other hand, they declared the qualifications of the accompanying staff, stating that they had no right to participate in the speech and were not going to investigate Japan. The former was to reconcile the feelings of the investigation team and take the opportunity to welcome Gu. The latter was afraid that others would misunderstand that Gu was going to Japan for investigation. The Japanese government took care of both the national system and the facts, and did not allow any mistakes. This is evident.</p>
<p>The task of the investigation team was originally limited to the Three Eastern Provinces of China. Japan was not originally included in the investigation. On this point alone, even if the Japanese government did not make a statement in advance, no one would make a misunderstanding again.</p>
<p>However, Gu Weijun was completely monitored during the investigation in the Three Eastern Provinces. He could not act freely at all and was interfered with everywhere. He had to return without any dignity. Now, Japanese news says that Gu Weijun's claim to investigate Japan is an overstepping and reckless statement. I don't think Gu would dare to say such big words. However, if Gu still has the leisure to be so generously inclined, gladly go, then Gu's magnanimity and his attitude of seeing enemies and benefactors as the same are admirable.</p>
<p>Some say that Gu's trip may still have other important missions. Is this possible?</p>

<h3>Self-Made False Paint Method</h3>
<p>— Nai Zheng</p>
<p>False paint, English name (Varnish), commonly translated as Fanlishui, is a kind of dark brown liquid, but there are also light-colored ones. When applied to the surface of an object, it dries into a glossy film, which is very beautiful.</p>
<p>The types of fake paint can be roughly divided into two types: (1) oil varnish, (2) alcohol varnish. Oil varnish dries because the volatile deep agent evaporates in the air and is affected by gasification. It dries slower than alcohol varnish. Alcohol varnish dries completely by evaporation. Although its drying speed is faster than oil varnish, it has the problem of cracking and falling off after drying, while oil varnish does not have the above-mentioned disadvantages. It is very durable, and the color is more beautiful. Now I have selected two methods to introduce below. One of these two recipes is oil varnish and the other is alcohol varnish.</p>
<p>Before manufacturing, you must first prepare some medicines and tools as follows: an enamel pot, a pair of bamboo chopsticks, a small-mouthed bottle for storing fake paint. As for the medicines, you can go to a Western pharmacy or instrument shop to buy some. The names of the medicines are listed below: Copal 4 ounces, Shellac 14 ounces, Gum Arabic 1 ounce, Alcohol 1 pound, and Naphtha oil 12 ounces. Because this is a small experiment, it is enough to put this amount. However, the price is not very cheap. The above medicines cost about five yuan. Now I will write the ingredients below:</p>
<p>(1) Fake Paint for Painted Furniture</p>
<p>Shellac (also known as shellac flakes) 12 ounces, Copal 3 ounces, Naphtha oil 1.5 quarts. (These are enough to varnish four chairs and one table, so when manufacturing for the first time, you can reduce the ingredients according to the ratio.)</p>
<p>(2) Beautiful Glossy Paint</p>
<p>Gum Arabic 1 ounce, Copal 1 ounce, Shellac 2 ounces, Alcohol 1 pound.</p>
<p>Method 1: First break up the copal and select the impurities contained inside, because the ones I bought contained plant matter, so it is best to buy pure ones. Then grind the shellac together to make it into a powder, then sift it with a linen cloth, then put it in naphtha oil, and put it in an enamel pot together, and slightly heat it over a fire below, and stir with bamboo chopsticks from time to time. At this time, the most important thing is to pay attention to the heat of the fire. If it is too hot, the oil will easily turn black and catch fire. If the heat is too low, it will not dissolve easily. These are some experiences. After dissolving, filter it again with a linen cloth and store it in a bottle. The manufacturing method of the second recipe is to first clarify the three kinds of glue, then grind them finely, put them in alcohol, and put them in a bottle together and mix them. But you don't need to heat it over the fire. Just seal the bottle mouth and place it in a warm place. After three days, they will all dissolve, and then filter them with a linen cloth and store them for use.</p>
<p>The first recipe above is a high-quality fake paint. It is very smooth and beautiful when painted on furniture. The second one can also be called a kind of glossy paint. If it is re-varnished on instruments that have already been varnished, it can increase the gloss and make it very beautiful. So all kinds of carvings and art products use it.</p>

<h3>If Not Him, Then Who Should She Marry?</h3>
<p>— Leng Mang</p>
<p>Miss Ye, who was praised by everyone as the county flower, was almost always the material for conversations among a group of young people.</p>
<p>How good is her face! How graceful are her movements! In short, everything about her made a group of young people infatuated. Each one was envious and each one fell into her bewitching array. Whenever Miss Ye was mentioned, they were all full of praise.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to ask who Miss Ye is? They would simply laugh their teeth off, as if saying: If you don't even know Miss Ye, are you worthy of being a young person in our county? Therefore, in this county town, there is no young person who does not know Miss Ye.</p>
<p>A group of bewildered young people, like crazy, were all hooking up with each other and teasing Miss Ye. As long as they could get a good smile, they would be satisfied. There was also a group of married young people who were afraid of not getting the qualification to grab Miss Ye, and they were all talking about divorce.</p>
<p>However, the value of Miss Ye was also raised day by day by this group of young people who didn't spend money and were willing to do advertising. Really, from the county magistrate to the most foolish old folks, no one didn't know Miss Ye.</p>
<p>Therefore, the county magistrate, although he had a wife, thought that he could not miss this opportunity to enjoy some beauty. Moreover, at that time, he had such a high position, so it was naturally easier to start.</p>
<p>The first step was to ask the principal of the girls' elementary school to be the matchmaker, because Miss Ye was a student of the girls' elementary school. As for the money, it was not a problem at all. There was plenty of land. There was only a little difficulty, that is, to get Miss Ye's consent. Therefore, the county magistrate invited two tables of wine. The first guest was naturally the principal of the girls' elementary school, followed by Miss Ye's elders and powerful people who could talk to Miss Ye.</p>
<p>Naturally, these people who were invited to dinner by the county magistrate, flattered and frightened, would listen to the county magistrate's plan, especially the principal of the girls' school, who had been so promoted by the county magistrate. In addition to being honored, he felt that the mission he shouldered was extremely important.</p>
<p>Sure enough, one day, Miss Ye cried and said; "I won't marry! I won't marry! This old thief!" This was entirely a response to the principal's request, and at the same time, many people were taking a surrounding position towards Miss Ye.</p>
<p>"Don't cry, Defang! Child! You have to know that he is the first big shot in our county. Except for him - the county magistrate - who else should you marry? I think - although he is a bit old, what does it matter?" The principal said this.</p>
<p>At the same time, many people agreed with the principal's words and said, "Really! If you don't marry him, who should you marry?"</p>
<p>Poor girl with a weak will, although she said: "I won't marry him," didn't she end up becoming the county magistrate's wife?</p>
<p>But, it's a pity for a group of young people who sell their strength, at this time they are only glaring with their wine cup-sized eyes - saying to friends - "You look at this 'Chilao' enjoying the happiness!"</p>
<p>School Laughter</p>
<h3>Female Spy</h3>
<p>— Bai Ning</p>
<p>The methods of running schools in Shanghai are truly progressing a thousand miles a day, leaving us only with surprise, admiration, and complete submission. They are able to keenly observe the social situation and also to understand the psychology of students. They know that in the current situation, boys' schools are not easy to run because they are not easy to control, and are prone to causing trouble. Therefore, they abandon boys and focus on girls.</p>
<p>In the past year or two, girls' schools in Shanghai can truly be said to have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. The signs of girls' schools are no less frequent than those of general merchandise and cigarette paper stores on the streets and lanes. However, the number of female students definitely cannot increase as rapidly as the number of girls' schools. Therefore, they cannot escape the unfortunate iron law of "supply exceeding demand" in economics.</p>
<p>However, our group of clever and insightful school operators will never sit idly by without a plan. With a frown, a plan comes to mind. They have seen through that girls love small advantages first and foremost, and secondly, they like to be fickle.</p>
<p>So they set up a vast net. First, they scouted out a few articulate and sociable top students, used a few sweet words, and promised some small benefits. Thus, they openly and officially sent them to ××·××.</p>
<p>These imperial commissioner misses, these spy ladies, received their imperial mandate and stepped into the school. Of course, their real purpose was not to study. All day long, they called each other "sister," "sister," and wandered back and forth, greatly displaying their social skills. As a result, some naive young ladies regarded them as bosom friends. At this time, they skillfully implemented their second clever plan, doing their best to attack the school thoroughly, saying things like the facilities are incomplete, the teaching is poor, the curriculum is terrible. And these ignorant and uninformed young ladies echoed them in unison. As a result, they used some trivial matters to stir up a storm.</p>
<p>Our group of pitiful young ladies, of course, also mustered a sense of righteousness, were passionate and indignant, and resolutely left the school. But, where do the birds who leave the nest fly to? Thus, they eagerly followed this spy lady and stepped into their slaughterhouse.</p>
<p>The school operators, with eager eyes, watched from their large and dark glasses as groups of young ladies in pink and green, carrying rolls of colorful banknotes, came in an endless stream. Truly, "Business is booming in all directions, wealth and profit reach all corners of the land." They could not help but secretly cheer, "What a brilliant plan!"</p>
<p>The success of the second batch encourages the endless production of the second batch, the third batch…</p>
<p>Nonsense</p>
<h3>Important People Are Like Western "Safety"</h3>
<p>— Ren Gan Niu</p>
<p>(A) Important people nowadays are like Western women.</p>
<p>(B) What makes you say that?</p>
<p>(A) If you break down the two characters for "important people," aren't they the same as "Western woman"?</p>
<p>(B) That's just the same shape of the characters. Is there any other similarity?</p>
<p>(A) Because important people nowadays are used to making empty promises to the people.</p>
<p>(B) Why make empty promises?</p>
<p>(A) Because important people are never willing to say a sincere word to the people. Therefore, their speech is just "playing around" to deceive people, and they never fulfill their words. The people are played with in vain.</p>

<h3>Extreme Joy Begets Sorrow</h3>
<p>— Hong Shui</p>
<p>It was a quiet time late at night. Liu Deguang ran excitedly into the bedroom of Donggong, his hair disheveled, his face showing a kind of pleasant emotion.</p>
<p>"Where did you come from? Liu Deguang!" Yu Xingfu asked, sitting by the bed.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha, it's really beyond expectations… How delightful!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"An unspeakably wonderful affair I encountered at the Bian'er Deng tonight!"</p>
<p>"Ah! You're going to act like a god or a ghost again!"</p>
<p>"…No, no, listen to me; right after the movie ended, I caught a glimpse of Liang Lizhen accompanied by another Miss also there… As she gracefully left, she deliberately left a rose-colored handkerchief with a green button on her seat."</p>
<p>"Oh! Is that worth making a fuss about?"</p>
<p>"But from my observation, she at least has some kind of intention!"</p>
<p>As the night grew deeper, under the light of a pale yellow candle, Liu Deguang forced a love letter, the wording roughly saying:</p>
<p>"… Receiving your fragrant handkerchief is better than the spring breeze benefiting me. I wonder if you know that my affection for you is not just a matter of a day. Now that I have received your hint, I am greatly favored. I have made a reservation for × day × time at × Ice Drinking Room to wait sincerely, and I hope you will grace us with your presence…"</p>
<p>So, filled with hope and joy, he fell on the couch. As soon as he closed his eyes, he seemed to be already in the Ice Drinking Room. Then, a crimson, ripe peach-like woman walked in, gently swaying her black skirt, revealing delicate and beautiful small feet. In her autumn water-like eyes, a hint of black pupils shone, and her flushed cheeks smiled, seeming to say to him:</p>
<p>"My love! I'm here!"</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>The next afternoon, the dormitory supervisor suddenly asked Liu Deguang to come over and handed him a letter with a cold smile. He only glanced at it, and his face instantly flushed, then turned pale, and his eyes stared straight ahead without saying a word.</p>
<p>"What to do? Liang Lizhen is still crying bitterly now!"</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>&lt;Unclear&gt;</p>
<h3>The Ticket Seller's Smile</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>For the needs of the journey, I jumped on the × bus.</p>
<p>In the third-class carriage, most of the passengers who got on first had seats, while the rest were standing crowded together. The wheels were moving, and the passengers were swaying involuntarily with the vibration of the bus.</p>
<p>The next stop arrived. The passengers waiting at the station crowded in again, which made the carriage feel even more "overcrowded."</p>
<p>"Who hasn't bought a ticket yet?" the ticket seller asked, squeezing through the crowd.</p>
<p>The sound of copper coins rang out in a mixed and jingling manner.</p>
<p>"××× how much…?" a middle-aged man who had just squeezed in asked.</p>
<p>"×× cents."</p>
<p>The fare was collected, and another stop arrived at the same time. The ticket seller rushed out in a hurry. The trolley wheel was advancing again.</p>
<p>"Who hasn't got tickets哈 people also..." he squeezed over for the second time</p>
<p>"Why the money has already been paid, but the ticket has not been given to me," the middle-aged man asked, urging.</p>
<p>The ticket seller looked at him, then handed him the ticket he was holding in his hand, and nodded to him, and said a slight sentence that could not be heard clearly, when his sentence just started, the face shows a slight smile</p>
<p>Probably he丨丨middle-aged man has understood, received the ticket to look at it, and did not ring</p>
<p>End of the street</p>
<h3>What I Saw at Dongxin Bridge</h3>
<p>— Li Nian</p>
<p>This is what I saw on the Dongxin Bridge tram last night.</p>
<p>Two rickshaws, carrying two foreign sailors in navy uniforms and red-knotted hats, were pulled quickly by our two noble compatriots. In the middle of the road, there were two of our noble compatriots standing there. Judging from their expressions, they seemed to be about to cross the road. Suddenly, as the rickshaw behind approached the two, the foreign sailor on the rickshaw raised his fist like a bowl and punched one of the two in the head with all his strength. When he looked back, the foreign sailor was still sitting high on the rickshaw, speeding away.</p>
<p>Oh my God! Chinese people are being treated like pigs and dogs.</p>
<p>I imagined that if the compatriot who was beaten had the spirit of resistance, he would have chased after him and punched him back. Then the two sailors would definitely jump out of the car immediately, chase after him, and a rain of fists would fall on him. His face would definitely be covered in blood, lying on the ground groaning, and the two foreign sailors, with victorious smiles, would leave triumphantly, leaving a circle of our noble compatriots watching the excitement, with a temporary look of anger on their faces, and vaguely hearing laughter…</p>
<p>Alas! I dare not think further.</p>

<h3>Female Telephone Operator</h3>
<p>— He Zhou</p>
<p>It's really "hating what you do." I asked a female relative who worked as a telephone operator at the Chinese telephone bureau, "Are you satisfied with your life as a telephone operator?" She then told me a series of "complaining" words. She said:</p>
<p>It's really hard to be a telephone operator. It's harder than being a police officer. You have to endure the time when you are on duty, and you can't escape it. Sometimes it's a three-hour shift, sometimes it's a six-hour shift. During the rest time, you can only rest in the dormitory. If you want to come out, you have to ask for leave from the supervisor. If you don't arrive at the bureau on time, you will be punished. The salary is pitifully low, with a total of twenty yuan for food and salary. After that, it's very difficult to increase it. The work is monotonous, and I really feel very bored. When the outside line comes in, generally frivolous young people often make fun of each other on the phone and make nonsense jokes. Although you can't see people on the other side, it's enough to be teased by him. Sometimes the line is so busy that if you are a little late on this side, they will report to Supervisor No. 50 as if looking for trouble, saying that we have offended him and deliberately didn't answer. Oh! In short, it's very hard to be a telephone operator, especially for us women.</p>
<p>After listening to this passage, I understand some concepts of female professionals in reality.</p>

<p>To Mr. Nai Zheng: I have long wanted to engage in the manufacturing of erasers for erasing pencils, but as a layman, I have no way to start. Now I see that your publication has an article on Mr. Nai Wei making various erasers. I think Mr. Nai Wei must have research on the manufacturing of erasers. Now I want to ask Mr. Nai Wei whether this kind of eraser manufacturing is suitable for small-scale home industry. If I open a factory, how much money will I need? What are the chemical components and refining methods of the rubber? If you can answer all the details so that I can have something to follow in order to fulfill my duty to promote domestic products, please forward this letter or show the address of Mr. Nai Zheng’s correspondence so that I can ask in a special letter.
