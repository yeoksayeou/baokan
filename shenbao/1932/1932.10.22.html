<p>政綱廢弛。曳治敗壞。至今日而極矣。公門多泄沓之士閭里播貪墨之風來賄遷包苴暮夜。或默契于無形。或心無照而不宣。其以此而罣吏議陷刑罟者百不一二覯也。關茸倖進者流。旣夙歆乎祿利之裕身。又熟察乎營私之無害。靈機萌動。耽逐是務。夫安有不舞爪張牙聯袂競登者乎。</p>
<p>彼以蠟官來者。其目的在將本而求利。其手段以搜刮爲能事。政治生命本等蜉蝣。今日同昇之雞犬。明日即難保爲尾閭之洩。五曰京兆之意象固已深鐫于若輩之腦際。擇肥而噬。飽則飛颺。咫尺綢繆。寗有遠圖。政府而欲藉此輩布令猷施德政安民生謀振發者。非等于眢井行汲。亦幾于望梅止渴耳</p>
<p>我國歷久沿傳之口頭語。有曰文官愛錢武官愛錢武官怕死者。按諸實際武官怕死未必盡然而文吏愛錢。則幾爲古今共有之通病。祗以時當治世法網嚴密蹈罪戾。難邀寛典雖以卿貳之尊。猶不能自全於刑辟。衣冠就戮。史不絕書。故爾時從政者。大都猶能自納軌物。不敢輕於　職固由敎化之所漸漬。亦嚴法之有以繩督于其後也。降及末世。紀律崩潰。人懷苟安自便之計不復以官箴爲顧忌。平日上下其手。儘容竭澤而漁。事至無可彌縫。即不難以一走自了。輦金歸來猶不失作一富家翁。有必獲之贏利。無意外之風險。此寗非天地間最堪歆羨最値經營之一種貿易乎。故在今日而欲言澄淸政治者。必先在肅官常。而欲肅官常者。又必先在嚴懲罰。舍此而外。更無第二義矣。</p>
<p>國民政府基於革命之精神而成立者也。摧斫貪汚。宜具夙志。黨綱所著標語所揭。煌煌文語。在人耳目。猶恐譏伺不密。執行不力。則有監察院以司糾舉彈劾之責。有懲戒委員會。以掌訊鞫處分之權。用意非不美也。布置非不周也。　　然而行之比年。事實所晤示於吾人者。適見科條等於具文監察幾同虚設懲戒未展宏效。貪汚依然充斥。此殆爲全國上下所痛心疾首而渴求一整飭之途徑也歟。</p>
<p>今監察院全體委員。鑒於政務官之必須裁制已嚴促政府成立國府懲戒委員會矣。懲治貪汚之專。庭亦旣在進行組織中矣。而軍委會蔣委員長復在勦匪區域内。厲以軍法。整肅官規。劉文蓋處快於先陳同儒等判罰於後最近鄂堤工局長陳克明復以浮報防水經費。嚴遭譴究如此雷厲風行幾何不使貪官喪膽。墨吏驚心。在輓近官紀頽弛之局面中不可謂非差强人意之舉抑吾人猶以蔣委員長所施行者爲軍法。所施行之範圍限於剿匪品域要求未能視同恒法推旣及於全國也。夫蔣於軍委會長而外。固明明一中央委員也則曷不以中央常委資格。建議政府。明著嚴律。施行全國。爲斷然之處置絕瞻徇之存念。庶政局有淸明之望。而下民獲昭蘇之機刷新吏治繫此一舉蚩蚩者氓。誠不勝致其殷切之期望矣。</p>

<p>照此方式計算、六成海軍第一次一齊射擊後、在二十七分間、可以全滅、因此彼在華盛頓倫敦會議、規定日本六·美國十海軍之比率、此即論理的戰略家北拉德將軍混同戰略與數學之公式N自乘法之暗示也、彼以爲有六成七分之優弊率、必可戰勝日本]、今北拉德欲實施創造之戰略、强制日本海軍定爲六成、故吾人對於倫敦海軍條約、可換稱爲北拉德條約、前所謂［輪陣型］者即採[N自乘法之公式、應用於艦隊渡洋法、惟此陣型、美國海軍最忌避者、即備日本潛水艦隊之途中奇襲時之［戰艦戰鬥力之保存法］、原來渡洋作戰時之艦隊序列、連合補給部隊、當達三十海里以上、欲對抗此序列時敵艦隊之奇襲、則吾人不得不布置搜索列、但此列在美艦隊之前方二百海里、其搜索列隊之距離、展望上以二十五海里爲最大限、吾人以十隻之前綫巡洋艦、更在夜間因視界狹小、不得不布設二重搜索列、故又以八隻巡洋艦、置於第二搜索列、然而敵方以優勢的巡洋艦隊、必企圖破壞我日本搜索列之一部、或敵方潛入潛水艦襲擊我主力艦隊、此時吾人可用輕巡洋艦以防備之、一九二八年、許士大將在上院海軍委員會上說明輪陣型、要求建造軍艦預算、一九三○年、北拉德提督補充許士意見、擬以八時砲巡洋艦配置搜索列、以六時砲巡洋艦使用輪陣型、照此計畫、美國自信可操太平洋上之勝戰、雖然、日本海軍在戰爭目的上兵力關係上、已有防禦之計畫、吾人對此輪陣型、實屬危險之至、何則、據海軍作戰家之見地、輪陣型原爲戰戰兢兢之防禦陣形、彼若以砲口向我出動夏威夷根據地、恰入於日本海軍之行動圈内、彼時囗囗囗島與囗囗海岸以東數百海里之海上、美國海軍必陷於非常危險之區域、而日本潛水艦之出動、機雷之布置、奇襲部隊之活躍、以及日本主力艦隊之進行、實難明瞭進行方向、則美國海軍方面、必大感迷惑、廻溯世界大戰時、英國才利提督率領比德二十倍優勢之艦隊、而設德蘭海戰、深恐德國潛水艦之夜襲、况日美兩國海軍之實數、無相上下、美海軍在三千海里以上之遠征、歷經數晝夜洋上之波濤、精神上已覺疲勞、其戰鬥力之不安、可以想見、由此觀之、美國海軍雖有攻擊軍、然在西太平洋之戰塲、不得不取防禦之勢、此所謂輪型陣者、實爲必敗之陣形也、（未完）</p>

<p>我們若要負得起前述的使命、必定要養成新的學風、無論校長敎職員學生都要努力於移轉風氣、由一校的風氣、轉移到全國的風氣、事務行政固不可廢、但是我們辦學校不是專爲事務、行政而來的、不是無目的去辦事的、若是專講事務、最好請洋行買辦來辦大學、我們必須有高尙的理想、以爲努力的目標、認定理想的成功、比任何　人的成功還大、個人任何犠牲、若是爲了理想、總還値得我認爲必須新的學風能夠養成、我們的使命乃能達到、</p>

<p>足球裁判員之責任與權力（下）</p>
<p>裁判不能姑息容忍</p>
<p>余今以比賽規律中裁判員須十分留意之一語奉告、此乃［裁判員不能姑息容忍從事］、因此而與裁判員發生莫大關係、或極度困難者、無有甚於此語、裁判果以姑息容忍執行之、則觀衆·球員·職員等將視裁判爲非軟弱無能、卽對於比賽莫明其妙、有時因姑息之故、不忍施行第九條第十七條（按爲罰十二碼球）之故、不知不覺之中、發生惡劣印象、卽裁判員予一方便利、而他方無之、或一球員罰以十二碼、他方球員犯之、則予以容忍、</p>
<p>一經判决堅持不變</p>
<p>更重要之一點、余願諸君更注意之、一裁判須有忠實不偏之判决、一經判决之後、雖天之將　、亦堅持之、萬不可更動判决、不可因一次判决之錯誤、於是欲使之平均、而予他方以有利之判决、球員可原諒一次之錯誤、但如此採此方法、以平均錯誤、則裁判之信任、將從此全失、人誰無故、余亦不敢謂在塲上决無錯誤、不受批評、更須以裁判個人自己之觀察意見、决定比賽之處理、决不可以觀者、球員或職員之意見處理之、</p>
<p>旣决定、堅持之、</p>
<p>執行裁判不分等級</p>
<p>執行裁判、並無等級問題之分、雖或有不同之標準、每一裁判之責任、爲以勇敢公正之精神、施行球規、執行裁判、或比賽之處理、决不可分爲等級、球規同樣施行於無論任何比賽、如一球員犯規放過之、其他球員犯之則罰之、是爲不公正、更不可於上半局放鬆責任、下半局捉緊之、球規之施行、不能緊於一人、鬆於其他、同樣有力施行於無論任何一隊、裁判之第一責任、卽以不偏不倚之態度、處理於法治下之任一球隊、</p>
<h3 id="c109">蘇格蘭裁判之不可 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>此爲蘇格蘭裁判員手册中之［裁判員之不可］、介紹之如下、（一）不可使球隊候汝、須凖蒞場、（二）不可暴躁、平心靜氣、（三）不可於球場指示球員、汝爲球規之解釋者、（四）不可於事後更變判决、使之適合一切、（五）不可重視觀衆、可置之不睬、以汝之意志爲意志、（六）不可拒絕有禮貌之請求解釋一判决、謙和答之、可得球員之信任、（七）</p>
<p>最後不可遺忘在訓練所中之後進裁判、全賴汝之保護及改進、</p>
<p>不必顧慮新聞登載</p>
<p>不必因新聞紙之記載而顧慮、以余之經騐、甚少之新聞記者、知球規詳盡、不可因新聞紙之贊美與棒場、便洋洋得意不可因此評責難、垂頭喪氣、如有時適汝減色不能保持同樣之高度標準、使人失望、因而不如前之贊美汝之處理、</p>
<p>台維遜之莫大欣幸</p>
<p>結束余言余於執行裁判中之莫大欣幸、乃余回顧蘇格蘭上屆之比賽塲中、引爲榮譽及欣喜者、卽余已竭盡所能、成一榮譽之裁判員、離蘇之日卽以此語告余同儕、余覺余能昂首挺胸、不面紅顏赧而離球場、自信余能不辱裁判員之令名、余深望能繼續永保持此精神、則當余放下銀笛之時、亦能作此語、談余在上海裁判之情形、</p>

<h3 id="c191">曲道而行 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>三代直道而行，這是久已過去的黃金時代，若論現代，恰是處處都主張着曲道而行。社會酬酢，商業宣傳，重要人物的大政方針，以及其他種種的應付方法，誰都不肯似蘇州人說的：衖堂裏拖木頭，直拔直。一定要摹仿女性的曲線美，以爲愈曲，愈圓，愈美，那麽發表的話，才可以不落邊際：如環無端。唉！不落邊際的話，便等於廢話一般！</p>
<p>件件般般的話，都可以不落邊際：假使，請人指示成敗，判斷優劣，似乎該有一種肯定的表示了；但是，據我所聞的兩椿笑話，指示成敗的，判斷優劣的，也可以用一種不落邊際的方法來對付。</p>
<p>昔日科舉時代，有三個考生，請敎某高僧預决成敗：高僧不加可否，只竪起着一個指頭。考生去後，或問高僧：這一個指頭，可以表示他們的成敗麽？僧道：這是不落邊際的表示，無論如何，總逃不了老僧的一指禪：假使三人都登第，這是一槪都成；三人都落第，這是一槪都不成；三人兩成而一敗，這是一個不成，三人一成而兩敗，這是一個成功：誰都逃不了這八面玲瓏的一指禪機。</p>
<p>又有一女郎，同時和三個戀人據着方桌而坐；三人同問女郎：我們三個人，誰好？女郎想出一個不落邊際的對答法：面向着對坐的戀人，道一句：你好。伊的高跟皮鞋的尖，悄悄在桌子下面分踢着左右兩戀人的脚，使同坐的三個戀人，都覺得這女郎讚他們好。</p>
<p>唉！直道而行的人，現在是没有的了；現代的公正人，評判人，正在那裏表示着一指禪機；正在那裏口許對方，而悄把鞋尖分踢着左右雙方的脚。</p>
<h3 id="c192">十九路軍一驍將 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 洪仰山</p>
<p>丨壯翁照垣將軍丨</p>
<p>忠勇抗日的翁照垣將軍，爲國家爭人格，爲民族爭光榮，早爲國内人士所欽仰，他是日本士官學校畢業生。畢業後，又去法國習航空，有一次在巴黎試演飛機，機在空際顚倒欲墜，地上觀衆，都以爲萬無生望，假使他人處此危險的情景，定由高空墮下斃命，但是將軍始終竭力支撑，卒能把飛機開到地上，只傷他的足部。</p>
<p>他以前曾做過師長，又去當兵一年，這種精神，眞可佩服，現在他還没有老婆，住着一個月十幾塊租錢的房子．</p>
<p>當滬事爆發的時候，將軍担任前方，在閘北與日兵抗戰，敵人不能進來一步，後因吳淞緊急，調將軍赴該地守禦，那時敵方以海陸空軍全力注吳淞，將軍指揮自如，堅守砲臺，以機關槍當大砲殺敵，他對部下說：［我們以槍殺敵，没有槍用刺刀，没有刺刀用槍柄，没有槍柄用手打用脚踢。］這是何等悲壯的話，十九路大軍已退，將軍還堅守砲壘不去。吳淞父老向他泣告，勸他留身體後日報國，至此纔痛哭退兵，猶在中國公學與日兵衝戰三陣。</p>
<p>翁將軍這次辭去旅長職務，專往國外提倡航空救國，到滬時，剛逢校中本學期義勇軍訓練的第一天，請他蒞校訓話，英氣弈弈，充溢眉宇，演詞中有說：［對中國前途不要抱着悲觀，我們要知道國難並不十分可怕，最可怕的，就是旣有國難大家不曉得去救它！］</p>

<p>丨給現代男性丨</p>
<p>朋友，你娶了妻没有？你也感到性的苦悶嗎？你是不是在追求？你是盲目的追求呢！還是已經有了相當的對手，伊也愛你嗎？你面孔是否漂亮？西裝是否考究？你口袋裏有鈔票没有？這些，伊都覺得滿足嗎？要不然，這些最低的談戀愛的條件，你一樣都没有，那我勸你，還是安靜點好！你徒然追求，結果是只有失望，决不能獲得對方一些同情：不，有時連一點反嚮也會没有丨因爲在這裏，就完全是一個黃金的勢力圈，照你的貧相，你根本就休想踏得進來！這是老實話，我不騙你。</p>
<p>［然而，你却不要灰心，你亦不要悲傷。你只要抓得住黃金，你一切都能滿足。個巴女人那問題眞是小的很！世界上女人眞多，漂亮的女人，一個個給有錢的人抓去了，就傷心，伊們是會一批一批添出來補數，來適應這時代的需要的。所以，在此刻，你且莫向女人追求，你該先追求黃金。只待你口袋裏的錢裝飽了，那時，管他是鬍子已經長得一把長，自然會有絕代的年靑的美人，來溫柔體貼的服侍你。不要說一個，十個八個也得，只要你高興，决不愁少。饒伊是一等大名件，只要你有錢，總買得來！</p>
<p>［朋友，你也在追求嗎？你也感到性的苦悶嗎？你如自問講戀愛的條件，都不完備的話，那我願意向你進個忠告，便是：我們且先想法弄錢！］</p>

<p>輕風拂過，海水漣漪似的微微動漾着，一片茅草地上，撑起，幾幢</p>
<p>布幔，留聲機從裏面放散出悠揚柔美的音調，陶醉了一對對並肩假寐着的摩登男女，梨皮栗榖，和威士忌，炭酸水的空瓶都像喝得爛醉的泥人似的，躺滿了他們的四周！</p>
<p>還是在滬戰中被敵艦猛轟得身首異處的二尊砲，至今尙陳屍在衰黃的秋草中，没人理會。但遍身的螺旋釘，却早已被人們盜賣乾凈了。上前仔細看時，［光緒二十七年，江南製造局造］幾個字，淸楚地躍入我的眼簾。啊！碧眼兒，東洋人，時常打從這裏經過，不知他們見了，作何感想？</p>
<p>幾條黃牛，低着頭，一邊擺動着尾巴，一邊怡然自得的吃草，他們似乎已忘記那被人們拴在鼻孔裏的繩子了！農人們手持鐮刀，孜孜兀兀，有的在收割高梁，有的在砍倒稻桿，他們簡直没有想到，前面的大海有幾多深，頂上的蒼空有幾多高。飛燕留戀着故土，翺翔在澄淸高潔的海面上，没有南歸。</p>
<p>我國的帆船，英國的商船，日本的軍艦，在日落崦嵫的時光，各自奔赴他們的前程！</p>

<p>— 浦婺修女士</p>
<p>不宜剪去應一律挽髻</p>
<p>女子留髮，由來已久，雲鬟霧鬢，風韻生焉，良以女子之視髮，珍之惜之，第二生命不啻也，乃者時移世變，剪髮風行，小家碧玉，朱門閨秀，欲求美化者，無不以付諸一剪爲快，間有因父兄之禁阻，夫君之不諒，仍不得不一辮長垂或雲髻低挽者，是亦少數耳　　紗廠絲廠女工，長埀烏辮，因風飛動，捲入皮帶，因而玉殞者，年以數十計，若十日報載吳淞薀草浜永安紗廠細紗間接紗頭女工常州人阿妹，即其一也，報載阿妹於九日晨工作時，偶不經心，忽被皮帶將髮辮捲入，一霎間即將長辮帶皮拔去，受傷倒地，恐有性命之憂，觀乎此，似乎女工應去其髮，以求安全矣。</p>
<p>然天下之事，有利必有弊，本埠各絲廠，前接歐洲廠家來電，中有華絲質料尙優，惟間雜以短髮，若用人工揀去，則費力異常，若以科學方法消去，恐有損絲經，善後之方，應請知照女工，勿於工作時理髮爲要等語，實則馬達一開，皮帶轉動，風力頗大，女工之已剪髮者，常有短髮吹下，混入絲中，裝出國外，安能暢銷乎。</p>
<p>鄙意女工如能不埀辮，不剪髮，一律挽髻，則雖有髮脫根，因緊紥之故，非於解開重挽時，不致下落，如此則雙方兼顧，兩得其宜，工作時旣可安全，而出品淸而不雜，行見風行全球，到處暢銷，則區區日貨劣絲，自無用武之地矣，願各廠事執事者，勿以其微而忽之。（移酬助東北義勇軍）</p>

<p>— 求幸福齋主</p>
<p>原來佟一貞的叔叔佟貴福，在先原是八旗子弟，又頭腦腐舊得很可以，一向爲了自身境遇的不佳，總歸咎於滿洲人遜國，眞龍天子不在位，使他再沾不着皇家恩澤的緣故。如今聽說宣統在長春豋極，恢復了滿洲國，便自以爲又有了從龍的好機會，不難平步靑雲，仍置身於貴族的行列。却不知溥儀只是個俘虜的班頭，日本人所玩弄的傀儡，世界上那裏眞有滿洲國存在？平白做這樣一個夢，居然還要忠心耿耿，瞧不起魯伯勤，也眞是天地間一個大蠢物呢。</p>
<p>魯伯勤年少氣盛，對於佟貴福這樣喪心病狂，頑梗不化，本欲大大與他起一番爭執，或至少也須加一些告誡的。但念在佟一貞分上，投鼠忌器，不容他任着性兒發脾氣；而佟一貞也在暗中苦心調停，屢勸他切莫拿這個頑固人的話當眞，頂好是置之不理，他也只好是勉强學著裝聾做啞付之一笑了。只是話不投機，從此他便懶得多上佟家來，寗肯仍舊約了佟一貞在露天下見面，不再看佟貴福那副語言無味面目可憎的怪嘴臉。</p>
<p>不料不如意的事是接續而來，魯伯勒他所寄命托身的郵政局，也逐漸起了許多不幸的葛藤，而發生搖動崩潰的危險。從前他堂兄所預料，日本人手段極其毒辣，必須將東北的一切利權，掃數侵蝕個乾凈，决不能再讓這個碩果僅存的中華民國郵政局仍得安然行使職權，到此時竟是不幸而言中。</p>
<p>這事情變化的過程是這樣的：起先日本人是藉口要檢查關内各地寄來的書報信函，派了些檢查員來郵局亂拆郵件，手忙脚亂，横衝直撞，那一份氣燄眞不知有多麽大。並又疑心郵局人員暗地把津漢報紙放行，不讓他們扣留得著，每每發脾氣說要槍斃人，便已與郵局人員閙得勢同冰炭。到了最近，槓出滿洲國作幌子，竟要把東北三省郵政全收歸滿洲國所有，限郵務長訂期移交，又對於一般郵務人員百般恫嚇，須繼續爲滿洲國忠心服務，否則派憲兵隊來逮捕。雖郵務長幸而爲歐美人，尙敢找出外國領事來和他們力爭，但爭到這水盡山窮的當兒，仍然敵不過蠻横的武力，眼見得這唯一的苟延殘喘的中華民國郵政局，也是不可保了！人員們仗著郵務長的庇護，或尙可領得一紙護照出境，但眞能夠這樣便宜的打發走嗎？到底還是没有敢保。</p>

<h3 id="c214">鑄鐡像 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前日報載。有某君建議廢止内戰大同盟會。主張爲内戰者鑄鐡像。植立本市重要處。所以資懲戒。這個懲戒方法。我不大贊成。因爲這種名譽懲戒方法不但陳舊。幷且也不足以發生効力。</p>
<p>［三代以上唯恐好名。三代以下惟恐不好名］大抵從前時代的人。還尙廉恥。崇節義。所以把秦檜等一般奸賊鑄了一個鐡像。使大家相戒以不敢犯。而現在的軍閥。他們心目中祇有權利。祇有地盤。决不因爲你鑄鐡像而有所顧忌。所謂［笑駡由他笑駡。好官我自爲之。］所以舊軍閥時代亦有行過這樣的一個方法。試問有什麽効力。</p>
<p>人民反對内戰。組織團體共同反對。已非一次不替三令五申假定。他們還有人民一些影子。放在腦裏。現在决不致再發生内戰。假定他們還把整個國家。放在腦裏。現在如此創深。痛鉅的外禍。擺在眼前亦决不敢。再發生内戰。因爲他們全不把人民和家國。放在心上。所以外患。儘管外患内戰。儘管内戰還有什麽說呢。</p>
<p>［不能留芳百世。何妨遺臭萬年。］原是古人的一句話。因爲留芳百世是不容易。而遺臭萬年也不容易。故替他們鑄鐡像。無異替他們宣傳。恐怕他們還求之而不得呢。幷且從前祇有秦檜張浚等幾輩權奸。鐡像還容易鑄。現在内戰雙方的是非先不容易。明白。是否僅將一方面内戰領袖鑄鐡像呢。還是兩方面的内戰領袖都鑄鐡像。還有一層現在内戰的領袖未必就是這幾位領袖。恐怕幕後還大有人在。而幕後的人比較出面的人還是要兇。試問僅鑄出面的領袖呢。丨未免不公丨如把幕後的領袖一幷鑄在其内。非但鑄不勝鑄。幷且也没有憑據。從何鑄起。</p>
<p>所以我不主張鑄鐡像。鑄鐡像是完全一種無聊的舉動。所以假定要積極主張廢止内戰的話。當思　　强硬而更有效的方法。否則只有聽他們内戰。他們自殺　有同歸於蓋的一日。</p>

<p>— 沈爾明</p>
<p>人造紅白二色的顏料，已於本刋前後登出，但其他的顏色，未見述及，故擇其簡易而普通者，介紹於下，</p>
<p>黃色人工顏料</p>
<p>摩舍金SnS2製法以錫末四十分，硫三十五分，　砂二十五分，或氧化四价錫八十分，硫六十分，磠砂三十分，或硫化二价錫二十分，硫十分，硇砂八分，置入鐡鍋，加熱至暗紅，得金色硫化四价錫，如溫度逾攝氏六百五十度，則此物熱解而成硫化二价錫，鐡鍋有蓋，連鶴頸管，通凝結器，硇砂於此收回，可以再用，摩舍金和膠可作金漆。</p>
<p>黃丹Pbo　製法以鉛置於旋轉煉爐中，以風扇鼓空氣氧化之，我國土法以硝石爲氧化劑者，黃丹不經久，易變硬無用，和油易乾，故爲乾料，黃丹又作玻璃及瓷粙之原料。</p>
<p>鋇黃BaCro4　製法以氣化鋇溶液，加入重鉻酸鈉溶液，所得黃色沉澱即是，其着色力不强，而性安定經久，用於油漆及水彩。</p>
<p>鋅黃ZnCro4　製法以中和性硫酸鋅熱溶液加鉻酸鉀，或以重鉻酸鉀十分，煑鋅白七十五分，所得沉澱即是，鋅黃溶於水，故不適於外用，被覆力着色力皆弱，而色則甚佳，用於鋼鐡防銹，但須塗護漆</p>
<p>鉛黃PdCro4　製法以水一百六十分，溶醋酸鉛四十分爲甲液，又以同量水，溶重銘酸鈉三十一分爲乙液，甲乙二液相混，則生沉澱，過濾而乾燥之，或以華氏五十度之水六百磅，溶硝酸鉛一百磅爲甲液，更以同溫同量之水，溶重鉻酸鈉三十五磅爲乙液，於沉澱桶中置華氏五十度之水二千磅，將甲乙兩液同時注入一充分　和，放定　過瀘，沉澱洗凈，加熱至華氏一百八十度而乾燥之，如用减壓乾燥法尤佳。</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>黃Cds　製法爲用含Cc及S之離子之鹽類溶液相和而取沉澱，鎘黃用於繪畫油墨．</p>
<p>綠色人工顏料</p>
<p>鉻綠Cr2o（Oh）4製法以硼酸三分重鉻酸鉀八分，和水成糊，入反燄爐熱四小時，得多孔體物質爲硼酸鉻，傾冷水中即得，鉻綠性安定能耐鹼及光熱，用於汽車蓬漆引擎漆牆漆等．</p>
<p>砒綠　製法以水二十分，碳酸鈉四分，溶氧化三价砥三分爲甲液，又以水四十分，溶膽礬即硫酸銅三分爲乙液，兩液相混，則生沉澱，過濾得之，砒綠有毒，色極佳，用於美術品，若和油研磨，過久色暗，惟於海水中能經久，是其優點．</p>
<p>銅綠Cu2（Oh）2Co3製法以膽礬液承認僞國</p>
<p>液加碳酸鈉取沉澱，銅綠能耐光，惟被覆力弱，用於繪畫油墨．</p>
<p>鉛綠　製法以二十七至二十八分醋酸鉛，三至四分硫酸二价鐡，分别加水溶解，將三至四分黃血鹽及九分重鉻酸鈉，置於同一桶中加水溶解，於沉澱桶中置水及二百分重石粉·三液同時注入，且注且拌過濾，沉澱乾燥之，鉛綠用於油漆及油墨，惟海邊空氣含鹽處，不宜用鉛綠作油漆．</p>
<p>鋅綠　爲鋅黃華藍之混合體，製法仿鉛綠，適用於内部裝飾，因着水常蔓延，車漆多用之，惟須加護漆以保衛之．</p>
<p>藍色人工顏料</p>
<p>華藍２（Ｋfefe（Cn）６）３．５H2O　製法以水三百分，溶硫酸二价鐡二十分爲甲液，又以水六百分，溶黃血鹽二十分，加鹽酸一分爲乙液，兩液相混　匀，加漂白粉八分，並以直接蒸氣促進氧化，放定，過濾，沉澱在濾器中需洗濯多次，乾燥之，華藍富着色力，用於油漆油墨漆皮油．</p>
<p>藍鉛　成分甚複雜，乃方鉛礦昇華所得，遇含硫氣體作用不著，用於製鋼鐡之護漆．</p>
<p>羣靑　少砂者化學式爲４Na2Al2Si2o8＋na2s4</p>
<p>多砂者爲２Na2Al2Si3Oio＋Na2S4製法有二</p>
<p>（一）硫酸鈉法　以瓷土硫酸鈉，碳，硫，砂爲原料，研細後入悶爐不與空氣接觸，熱至亮紅，歷八小時得暗綠多孔體，研細平布淺盤中厚寸許，蓋以硫末加熱得藍色物質，研細以水洗去硫酸鈉及亞硫酸鈉，更加硫化鈉液煑沸去硫．</p>
<p>（二）碳酸鈉法　以瓷土，碳酸鈉，碳，硫，砂爲原料，研細入悶爐中平布十四英寸厚，加熱歷三星期至四星期，放冷歷十日至十二日，所得物質上屬藍色，下層帶綠色，乃分别水飛之，羣靑能耐熱耐鹼，用於牆漆及車漆，含鉛物體不可並用．</p>

<h3 id="c218">人力車問題 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>人力車在其發源地的日本，已漸漸的稀少罕見了，因爲他知道拉人力車是反背人道的非人的生活，在人間是不應有的：然而在咱們中國却還在興致勃地今日一家［利運］，明日一爿［大生］，人力車公司是有增不已的發達丨老　藉以剥削，拉者拚命求活，乘客賴爲交通的利器。</p>
<p>僅就上海而言，我們站在一條普通的馬路上，留心看着，大槪不需一分鐘，至少有十輛以上的人力車拉過，至於閙市，當然牽連不斷了。拉車爲［業］的人竟如此之多！有人問：［上海怎麽會有這些人來拉車？］事實告訴你：［他們都不是本地人。他們抛離了他們的家，園，田，地，鋤，犁，石磨，水碓，黃牛，母雞·········跑到上海來困苦，掙扎？］但是他們爲甚麽棄了他們的所有呢！答案很簡單：［兵匪，災害，高利，重稅：還有資本主義的勢力伸張到了農村·········農村便這樣無條件的崩潰了，他們的所有給毁滅了！於是一個個相率到都市裏來。都市裏有甚麽可給他們幹？必然的，他們便做了資本主義者的奴。</p>
<p>［勞工神聖］，能夠適應於拉人力車爲［業］的苦力嗎？這簡直是欺騙和麻醉勞苦弱者的話！有些人以爲拉車的每天有一二塊錢的進益，日積月累，是很可觀的。勞苦有代價，倒也罷了。其實，十倍於此的進益，也不能抵償他們犧牲的萬一的代價！因爲他們（一）勞苦過度；（二）營養不足；（三）睡眠缺乏；（四）居住惡劣·········當然的，他們的健康，都給摧殘毁滅盡了！留着的，你去看，只不過是些黃面，瘦骨，彎腰，曲背，兩條腿移動着的東西！</p>
<p>有些人也曾覺悟到拉人力車不是人</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>的生活，是殘忍不人道的。然而他們只不過［覺悟到］，至多便是消極的不乘。有時因爲趕急或任遠而又不得不賴以當步，這時要是拉車的跑慢了些，他便忘了甚麽［人道］［鬼道］，他必足擊踏板［猪玀！快點！］或是拉車的爭錢討價，他會很快的償之以嘴巴，哼之以［忘八蛋！］······或有人以爲［在萬商會集，物質文明的上海，不應當留着人力車的存在，因爲這是有損中國在國際間的體面和莊嚴而給外人恥笑我們文化落後，所以應像洛陽驅妓一樣無條件的驅逐出境。·····］這些，這些，這樣，這樣，算是［人道］呢？算是同情呢？還算是完滿的解决了人力車問題？丨滾開罷！</p>
<p>現在，我們爲人力車夫請命，請求資本主義者本身覺悟，本身覺悟到［人吃人，結果只是大家毁滅，同歸於盡］！那有甚麽意思？其次，我們來携手共同努力，重新估計，重新建設一個理想中的新的生活，新的社會！我們先來走這兩條路丨</p>
<p>（一）因爲他們從農村中來，就應當使農村建設科學化，鞏固農村經濟；發展農村敎育；更應當組織大規模的有計劃的屯墾團丨注重生產和開發。</p>
<p>（二）因爲他們没有工做，有錢的就應當放棄一貫的榨取肥己政策，擱置習傳的投機冒險事業，請集中而雄厚資本。</p>
<p>大規模的創立許多管理科學化的大工廠丨注重生產和建設。</p>
<p>末了，我再喊一聲：［人力車問題，不是局部的個人問題，是整個的社會問題！］</p>
<p>闊綽</p>

<p>— 鐡血人</p>
<p>已經隔了數年不曾見面的親友，Ｌ君，自從滬戰發生後，他們已經遷到某租界Ｍ路的一所新房子啊！］姊妹對我說.</p>
<p>[當然：性命要緊！難道性命都不要麽！而且他們又加一個［富］字的人家呢！]我一面翻着報紙答道.</p>
<p>［但是］···心裏忽然地下了命令；非去拜候拜候不可，於是丢開報紙，立時穿上一件不長不短的長衫，跑出門去，那時祗八點鐘，大約跑了半點鐘時候，才把那所新房子找着，忽然聽見尖銳聲，似乎在喴我呢！回頭一顧，呵！原來C君的妹妹S小姐呢，</p>
<p>［我們就住這一家，請進内坐坐吧，哥哥剛出去啊！]她的面孔像佛一般的笑着，對我說.</p>
<p>［呀！C君，長遠不見了啊，］她的媽媽微笑道.</p>
<p>［許久不見了；自從滬戰後，你們有損失没有呀？]我問.</p>
<p>［没有什麽損失，總之·····[話打斷了].</p>
<p>［媽媽！哥哥回來了］，S小姐飛也似的跑來喊道.</p>
<p>［君什麽風吹你來的?隔了多年了,未和你見面,]L君有些冷淡,而帶驕傲的說.</p>
<p>後來和他東談談,西談談,說了一番,用點心吧,他拿了點心,請我吃,我老實不客氣,大吃特吃,不管他三七二十一;</p>
<p>［唉!今天［倒霉］極了］!他嘆着口氣說.</p>
<p>［什麽［倒霉］呀?不妨說給我聽]我懐疑着問.</p>
<p>因爲她[L君的情人]昨天約我明天一定和她到修容室,修指甲,到今早,我倆跑到目的地,不半句鐘,把它修好了,付了一元給那個婦人[修指甲的西女人]後來我也拿一元出來修修,那知她一個不當心,把我的指頭觸出血來,眞使我痛極了,我早知以一元的代價,而還得到了［痛苦］,你說氣不氣呢,他咬牙切齒地喊道.</p>
<p>聽了這話,幾乎把我哽死;剛才咬了一口蛋糕,不上不下,弔在喉當中,用盡了啜乳之力,才把它咽下,</p>
<p>想想像你這樣的人眞笨極了,如果把這一塊錢,去［捐助東北義勇軍］還可買得幾只彈子,把［矮子］殺個［痛快］丨［何樂而不爲呢］.（却酬）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Necessity of Punishing Corruption by Du Liang <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Political principles are abandoned, and governance is corrupt, reaching its peak today. Many officials in public service are negligent, and the wind of corruption spreads among the people. Bribery comes in the morning and packages at night, sometimes implicitly understood, and sometimes tacitly known without explicit acknowledgment. Yet, only a handful of those who engage in such practices are impeached or punished by law. Those who seek advancement through illicit means are already accustomed to the abundance of official benefits and familiar with the impunity of personal gain. With cunning thoughts stirring, they are devoted to these pursuits. How could they not brandish their claws and teeth, joining hands to climb the ranks together?</p>
<p>Those who come to office seeking profit aim to recoup their investment with interest. Their means are focused on exploitation. Their political lives are as ephemeral as mayflies. Today, they rise together like chickens and dogs, but tomorrow, even maintaining their position will be difficult. The image of collecting "capital funds" is deeply etched in their minds. They choose the fattest morsels to devour and fly away once satisfied. With only short-term calculations, they have no long-term vision. If the government hopes to use such individuals to issue wise decrees, implement virtuous policies, secure the people's livelihood, and promote revitalization, it is like drawing water from a dry well or quenching thirst with the sight of plums.</p>
<p>An age-old saying in our country goes: "Civil officials love money, military officials love money, and military officials fear death." While it may not be entirely true that all military officials fear death, civil officials' love for money is a common ailment throughout history. Only in times of good governance and strict laws are transgressions difficult and leniency rare. Even high-ranking officials cannot escape punishment. Executions were frequently recorded in history. Therefore, most politicians in those times were able to restrain themselves and dare not be negligent in their duties, due to the gradual influence of education and the strict legal supervision that followed. But as the world declined and discipline collapsed, people harbored thoughts of seeking ease and convenience, no longer regarding official morality as a concern. They routinely manipulated things for personal gain, exhausting resources like draining a pond. When matters became irredeemable, they easily absconded, returning with their ill-gotten gains to live as wealthy men. There was a guaranteed profit without unexpected risks. Is this not the most enviable and worthy trade in the world? Therefore, if we want to talk about cleaning up politics today, we must first rectify official conduct. And to rectify official conduct, we must first impose strict punishments. There is no other way.</p>
<p>The National Government was established based on the spirit of revolution. It should be determined to eliminate corruption. The slogans and banners proclaimed in the party platform are clear and visible to all. Yet, there is concern that scrutiny is insufficient and enforcement is weak. Hence, there is the Control Yuan to oversee impeachments and accusations, and the Disciplinary Committee to handle investigations and punishments. The intentions are good, and the arrangements are thorough. However, after years of implementation, the reality shows us that the laws are mere formalities, the supervision is almost nonexistent, and the disciplinary actions have not been effective. Corruption is still rampant. This is a matter of deep concern and frustration for the entire nation, and a path to rectification is desperately sought.</p>
<p>Now, all members of the Control Yuan, recognizing the necessity of restricting political officials, have urged the government to establish a National Government Disciplinary Committee. A special court for punishing corruption is also in the process of being organized. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission is vigorously enforcing military law and rectifying official regulations in the bandit suppression areas. Liu Wen's case was quickly followed by the sentencing of Chen Tongru and others. Recently, Chen Keming, the head of the E-di engineering bureau, was severely reprimanded for falsely reporting flood control expenses. Such swift and decisive actions cannot fail to frighten corrupt officials and alarm corrupt clerks. In the recent situation of declining official discipline, these can be considered somewhat satisfactory measures. However, we still believe that Chairman Chiang's actions are military law and the scope of implementation is limited to bandit suppression areas. It is hoped that they will be regarded as permanent laws and extended to the whole country. Chairman Chiang, in addition to being the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, is clearly a Central Committee member. Why not, in his capacity as a Standing Committee member of the Central Committee, suggest that the government explicitly enact strict laws and implement them nationwide? This decisive action, free from favoritism, would bring hope for a clean government and provide the people with an opportunity for recovery. This one action would revitalize officialdom, and the masses eagerly await it.</p>
<p>Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e2">Han Fuqu Resigns as Chairman of Shandong Province <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Han and Liu Both Telegraph to the Capital Reporting a Ceasefire.</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu stated that the purpose of the Liu campaign was to alleviate the suffering of the people. Now that the suffering has not been removed, he feels uneasy. He specially telegraphed Lin, Song, Chiang, and Zhang to resign, saying, "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, Acting President Song of the Executive Yuan, Commander-in-Chief Chiang of Hankou, and Chairman Zhang of the Beiping Military Affairs Committee Branch, Fuqu, a man of meager talents, by chance was appointed to provincial administration. He is always in awe of the ice and abyss. Shandong Province is a strategic location, and the times are fraught with crises. Any slight misstep could lead to disaster. He has worked hard to maintain it, and fortunately, he has avoided disaster. For the past two years, he has been exhausted and unable to tell anyone. From spring to summer, he has repeatedly telegraphed to resign, but has not been granted permission. Now that the national crisis is deepening, how dare he shirk his responsibility? However, since the suffering of the people has not been removed, his conscience is uneasy. If he cannot secure the interior, how can he resist foreign aggression? He feels that the responsibility is great, but his energy is insufficient. After careful consideration, if he stays, he will only be a useless burden; if he leaves, he will feel at ease. Therefore, he can only express his feelings and respectfully request permission to resign from his position as Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government. Fuqu is by nature straightforward and speaks from the heart. Having been under your protection for a long time, he believes that you will understand. If there is still a way forward, he will not make unnecessary requests. He humbly asks that you understand his sincerity and approve his resignation so that he can rest and recuperate. Then, all his days will be filled with gratitude. If, with your blessings, his energy is restored, he will still strive to serve and repay your kindness. He eagerly awaits your orders. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, bows." (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han told people that as long as he is in charge of Shandong for a day, he cannot sit idly by and watch the people of Jiaodong suffer from the tyranny of Liu Zhennian. Today, Han held a banquet for Gan Naiguang in the Provincial Government. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Military Affairs Commission has learned that Han and Liu have both telegraphed to the capital, reporting a ceasefire. The troops on both sides have complied with the order to withdraw to the areas designated by the central government. It is said that Chairman Chiang will send another high-ranking official to Shandong to consult with Han and Liu in order to resolve everything as soon as possible. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian's representative, Yang Lichuan, visited He Yingqin at nine o'clock the night before, reporting that Liu's division in Ye County was still under siege, and the fighting in Laiyang was also urgent. He hoped that the central government's authority could quickly order Han's troops to retreat to their original defenses. He Yingqin said that the telegram had already been sent and since Liu could accept it, Han should also agree. However, whether the ceasefire will be implemented will depend on whether both sides accept the telegram he sent. If either party does not accept the ceasefire order or outwardly agrees but secretly disobeys, the central government will take strong measures to maintain its authority. It is said that Liu Zhennian has sent a reply telegram stating that five counties should be designated as defense areas, and Han must completely withdraw from the remaining old defense counties, with local police responsible for local security. If this is a central government order, he will definitely comply. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It was received from Ye County via radio by a certain party that Han's army began using various mixed cannons from the northwest on the 19th night to fire into the city, with fierce and unusual bombardments. It only stopped on the 20th morning, with a total of over 2,000 cannons fired that night. Civilian casualties and house destruction in the city were extremely heavy. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Liu Zhennian's Chief of Staff, Han Dong, received a telegram from Liu in Hankou, saying that he had complied with the order to cease fire. It is said that Zhang Fang will go to Shandong to mediate. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Zhennian sent the following telegram to his representative in Beijing: (1) Our division has long ceased military operations in accordance with the central government's order, strictly restrained its troops, and patiently waited for a resolution. However, Han's troops are still using more than a hundred heavy artillery, field artillery, and mortars to bombard Ye City day and night. (2) Han's two aircraft, one with a red body and white wings, and the other with a yellow body and gray wings, both with red sun markings under their wings, come to Ye City several times a day to drop bombs. Ma's telegram states that Han's troops are still sending small units in plainclothes to attack the west gate of Ye City every night, blowing bugles and setting fires everywhere before retreating.

<h3 id="e3">Sichuan Generals Jointly Overthrow Liu <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Telegram to the Capital Requesting Dismissal of Liu Wenhui and Delivery for Punishment</p>
<p>Publicly Elected Liu Xiang as Commander-in-Chief of Sichuan-Kangqing Pacification</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui Orders Xia and Zhang's Troops to Threaten Chongqing</p>
<p>(Chongqing) More than ninety division and brigade generals from all over Sichuan jointly telegraphed to the capital, requesting the dismissal of Liu Wenhui for investigation and punishment. Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, Li Jiayu, and Liu Xiang's units resolved to send a public telegram, publicly electing Liu Xiang as Commander-in-Chief of Sichuan-Kangqing Pacification, with Tian Songyao as his deputy. Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, Sun Zhen, Liu Zhaoqian and others serve as Chief and Deputy Commanders to resolve the 24th Army and implement the outlines for governing Sichuan. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Liu Wenhui's subordinates Chen Hongwen, Chen Guangzao, Xie Deji, etc., led more than 30,000 men to fiercely attack the positions of Li Jiayu and Luo Zezhou. Li and Luo joined forces to counterattack, and Shunqing was occupied by Li and Luo's troops on the morning of the 19th. The provincial army retreated to the west bank of the Jialing River, more than thirty miles away. Liu Wenhui ordered Xia Zhongde, Xiang Yuren, Zhang Zhihe, and Leng Yindong, and other division and brigade commanders to threaten Chongqing from the south bank of the eastern route with a large force, penetrating deep into Ba County. (21st Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Chongqing telegram stated that the local military headquarters received a telegram from Liu Cunhou stating that his troops had already been dispatched and would join Yang, Li, and Luo's three units in Shunqing within a few days. Another telegram from Wusheng stated that after Shunqing was captured, the 24th Army was preparing to counterattack in Lijia Ferry. In order to avoid threats, Yang, Li, and Luo decided to first clear the area near Shunqing. The 24th Army's retreat to Pengxi was a plan to lure the enemy deep, not a real retreat. Yang, Li, and Luo took the bait and advanced step by step. After Shunqing was captured, the 24th Army was greatly panicked. If Pengxi is difficult to hold, they will retreat further.

<p>(Nanjing) A certain military agency received a Sichuan telegram stating that 103 Sichuan army division, brigade, and commander level officers, led by Tang Shizun, jointly sent a telegram on the 17th, stating that Liu Wenhui's opposition to the outlines for governing Sichuan was a deliberate attempt to destroy peace, requesting that the military leaders work together to sanction him, and imploring the central government to severely punish him.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhong Tidao, the Director of Mongolian-Tibetan Studies at the General Staff Headquarters, said that the situation in Sichuan is complicated. If the defense zone system is not broken, the people of Sichuan will never have a chance to recover. The current war will not resolve the Sichuan situation, but only add to the suffering of the people. If Deng, Tian, Yang, and Liu unanimously cooperate with Liu Xiang to resist Liu Wenhui, it will only overthrow one Liu Wenhui and create several more. This matter will provide Japan with excellent propaganda material and will also arouse dissatisfaction in international public opinion. Unfortunately, all the resolutions of the Western Defense Conference of our headquarters have become empty promises. Recently, the Xikang radio station has reported on how the Tibetan side is replenishing new equipment and preparing for a counterattack. The situation is serious, and the future is worrying.

Cunhou feels it is difficult to sit idly by, so he has to obey the central government's telegram order and, at the request of the generals, send Liu Shizhang Bangjun to the northern route to coordinate with the armies and do his best to mediate the Sichuan war in order to end the conflict as soon as possible.

<p>(Shenyang) The Kwantung Army Command feels very troubled by the rebel army in Heilongjiang Province. Commander Mutō originally wanted to deal with Su and Zhang, but because Su and Zhang had long known the Japanese tricks, they learned from the Japanese trick of attacking our Shenyang first, taking preemptive measures to detain Consul Yamazaki and Special Agency Chief Kohara, and confiscating the weapons of the Japanese garrison. The Japanese military headquarters was caught off guard when they heard the news. More than 200 Japanese residents were also detained. Mutō originally wanted to launch a large army to attack Su and Zhang, but because the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway was in the hands of the rebel army, and he feared provoking a conflict between Japan and Russia, and because the Japanese residents were in the hands of Su's army, he feared injuring his own people if he bombed with aircraft. Therefore, he used deceptive means to try to trick the Japanese residents out first, and then attack the rebel army. The rebel army had already seen through their trick and ignored any proposals. The Japanese changed their policy and turned to the Russian consul, asking the rebel army to release the Japanese residents. Before the Japanese residents are released, the war in Heilongjiang Province cannot progress. (21st China United News Agency Telegram)</p>

It is reported that Japanese troops are now advancing south from Taian, carrying out bandit suppression work on the west bank of the Liao River. The bandit stronghold Gaodian, on their flank, is defended by 700 surrendered bandits. It is expected that Bai Batian, the bandit leader who kidnapped the two Britons, and his 160 followers will eventually surrender. The bandits were quite friendly when they parted with Mrs. Pawley, claiming that there was no animosity between them and saying that they would visit her father, Dr. Phillips, to ask him to treat their wounds. During their captivity, the two kidnapped Britons helped the bandits treat their wounds. (21st Reuters Dispatch) (London) After receiving the news tonight of the release of the two kidnapped Britons in Niuzhuang, a Reuters reporter immediately visited their husband and father.

<p>(Tianjin) Tram and electric light workers began a slowdown at 5 a.m. on the 21st. Two thousand workers reported to work and left work on time, but the trams continued to run as usual, without collecting fares. Electric lights continued to generate electricity. The original plan was not to turn off the power switches during the day, but because of concerns about insufficient power, the switches were still turned off. The city party headquarters and the social bureau sent representatives to mediate at noon on the 21st, but the company refused. The foreign manager, Wang Gesen, expressed hope that the provincial government would, together with the consuls of various countries, make a fair judgment and formulate rules to be permanently observed, otherwise there would be a labor dispute every year, which would be endless. The provincial government ordered the city government and the city party headquarters on the 21st to mediate properly. According to Yu Xuezhong's statement to reporters, the slowdown had been brewing for many days. Since the company did not agree to the workers' demands, it should have reported to him in advance. It is too late to ask him to mediate now that the incident has occurred. However, he hopes that the workers will not make excessive demands and should know when to stop. The slowdown committee hosted the press on the evening of the 21st, reporting on the company's oppression of workers and the inevitable slowdown. It is reported that the company lost more than 4,000 yuan in one day of the slowdown.

According to people from Baotou, the Northwest has had a bumper harvest this year, but because of high labor costs and low prices, most of the grain has not been collected. Millet in Baotou costs 7 jiao per dan (approximately 270 catties), but because the transportation costs and taxes are surprisingly high, it is more expensive to transport it to Pingjin than it is to produce it there, so it is stockpiled there and no one cares about it. Cheap grain hurts farmers, which is truly lamentable. (21st Dispatch)</p>

<p>Observations of the Vice President of Citibank</p>
<p>Guomin Agency, San Francisco, 20th: Howard, the Vice President of Citibank, who traveled the Far East, inspected Manchuria and various parts of China and Japan, arrived here today and told people that Japanese arms factories are currently processing and manufacturing day and night, and the amount of production is astonishing. However, the underlying motives are not yet fully understood. The purpose of its war preparation plan does not seem to be aimed at the United States, because what is currently being manufactured is focused on army supplies. According to his observation, there seem to be two possibilities: one is to prepare to invade North China and attack Peiping and Tianjin, and the other is to prepare to fight against Soviet Russia. However, both of these are currently just possibilities. Howard also praised the completeness and fairness of the Lytton Report, saying that he personally agrees with its recommendations. It should be known that Japan has invested millions in Manchuria and should have the right to protect its invested capital.</p>

<p>Insists on Direct Sino-Japanese Negotiations for Pending Issues</p>
<p>Unmoved by League of Nations Pressure, Not Hesitating to Withdraw</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: Representative Matsuoka Yosuke, who will attend the League of Nations General Assembly to discuss the Manchurian Incident and express Japan's beliefs, departed from Tokyo Station at 9:20 PM tonight. Accompanying him were secretaries Shiowaza and Kichi, as well as special correspondents from various news agencies. Those seeing him off at the platform included Foreign Minister Uchida and other leaders from the Foreign Ministry, Army, Navy, and both the Seiyukai and Minseito political parties. Matsuoka's group will travel via Tsuruga to Vladivostok, then by the Siberian Railway to Moscow, where they will stay overnight. They will also stay overnight in Berlin and are scheduled to arrive in Geneva around the 5th of next month.</p>
<p>Japan League News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: Upon his departure, Matsuoka Yosuke issued a statement saying, "Since being appointed as representative to the League of Nations General Assembly, I have repeatedly stated that this assembly poses no issue of contention between Japan and other countries. Japan is acting on the right path and expresses this belief by acknowledging the fact of [Manchukuo]. Therefore, the remaining issue is to explain the reasons why the Manchurian Incident had to occur. Although it may be difficult for people in Europe and America to understand Eastern affairs, if we sincerely and earnestly explain the situation in the Far East and the special circumstances of Manchuria and Mongolia, there will surely come a day when they gain a proper understanding." He continued, "The Japanese people are a peaceful nation, as proven by history. Therefore, in the current situation, they are most concerned about world peace and will undoubtedly cooperate with other countries to achieve it." Japan League News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: Today, the Cabinet formally decided on Japan's policy toward the League of Nations and its opinion on the Lytton Report in a cabinet meeting, which was then handed to Matsuoka Yosuke to take to Geneva. Simultaneously, Foreign Minister Uchida met with Matsuoka and instructed the Japanese delegation on its policy toward the League of Nations, the content of which is as follows: (1) Interference by the League of Nations in the Sino-Japanese issue has prevented a quick resolution and has instead complicated the situation, leading to the deterioration of peace in the Far East. Therefore, Japan earnestly explains this situation, hoping the League of Nations will observe the overall trend. (2) All pending issues between China and Japan should be resolved through direct negotiations between the two countries concerned. (3) Japan respects the authority of the League of Nations and will not adopt an attitude of disrespecting the Lytton Report. (4) The point on which Japan insists most strongly to the League of Nations is that if the League of Nations adopts any tactics regarding the undeniable fact of [Manchukuo]'s independence, Japan will not yield. Furthermore, Japan will absolutely not allow any changes to the facts of Japan's recognition of [Manchukuo] and the conclusion of the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol. If the League of Nations authorities adopt an attitude that disregards these facts, Japan will not hesitate to resort to the final measure of withdrawing from the League of Nations.</p>

<p>Universal News, Sacramento: Judge Thompson gave a speech at the local Lions Club, predicting that if the administrative methods of Honolulu are not changed, the island will no longer belong to the United States. He stated that the island has a population of 370,000, half of whom are Japanese, with only 37,000 Caucasians. Local elections are already controlled by Easterners. The American government is aware of the seriousness of this situation and is now earnestly seeking a way to maintain American ideals in the archipelago.</p>
<p>Reuters, Idaho, 20th: Senator Borah, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, gave a speech here today advocating for the presidential election, expressing his personal detached views. Regarding the Philippines, he said that he wished American warships had never sailed into Manila Bay. He wants to abandon the Philippine Islands as soon as possible. He then spoke about foreign debts, saying that he does not support completely canceling war debts, but argues that the money can be used to expand the foreign market for American exports. He then spoke about the difficulties of American agriculture, saying that the solution should be sought in international relations. If Europe continues to use 85% of its income for military equipment, the United States will inevitably be affected.</p>

<p>Japanese Ministry of Interior Strives to Suppress It</p>
<p>Police Armed Starting Next Year</p>
<p>Universal News, Tokyo: The Japanese Ministry of Interior, in view of the frequent occurrence of domestic violent acts since the May 15th Incident, with recent bank robbery incidents, is actively devising countermeasures. Measures already implemented include thorough security of seaports and plans to control firearms and gunpowder. In addition, it recognizes that the group action and armament of police officers is necessary to combat violence. It has been decided to establish a new special police force system starting next year, first in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and then gradually emulate it in Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo, Yokohama, and other major cities. The total personnel of the special police force established in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department will be 500, purely adopting a military style. Two hundred and seventy personnel will form one large unit, while the other two hundred and thirty personnel will be stationed at the Prime Minister's residence, various ministerial residences, and other important government offices to provide security in case of emergencies. Each large unit will be divided into three medium units, each medium unit with ninety people, and each medium unit divided into three small units, each small unit with thirty people. Each large unit will have a commander and deputy commander, and all members will be armed, receive military training, and be equipped with handguns, bulletproof vests, and other equipment.</p>

<p>Liberal Party Launches Strong Criticism</p>
<p>Simon Defends the Government</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th: The parliamentary debate on the Ottawa Agreement entered its third day. Generally, supporters of free trade launched strong criticisms, while Foreign Secretary Simon defended the government. Opposition member Samuel claimed that the government's act of forcibly binding Parliament for more than a year during negotiations on tariff agreements was a violation of the constitution. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that this was not a new initiative and cited previous instances where Parliament was bound on tax rates for more than a year to prove his point. He also stated that the notion that Britain cannot successfully negotiate with other countries because of the Ottawa Agreement is inaccurate. Currently, various countries are contacting the British Foreign Office to negotiate trade matters, and Britain now has a tool to discuss with other countries. The Ottawa Agreement was passed with 451 votes in favor and 84 against.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 21st: During the debate in the House of Commons tonight, British Foreign Secretary Simon explained the attitude of the Liberal Party in remaining in the cabinet, citing the words of Gladstone and Cobden, asking his former comrades to consider the serious situation in the face of many problems currently encountered by the country, and then decide whether to attack the current government. Havas News Agency, London, 20th: Britain will soon conduct negotiations on tariff matters with certain countries, and the result may be to increase the current British import tariff rate. This move is highly possible because after Britain concluded the Ottawa Agreement, it agreed to grant the minimum preferential tax rate to each dominion. However, for other countries outside the empire, the general tariff rules are uniformly applied. Therefore, if Britain wants to favor certain countries, it must increase the tax rate applicable to other countries. Accordingly, there will be three types of British import tariff rates: (1) The tariff rate applicable to all imperial possessions. (2) The intermediate tariff rate, i.e., the current external tariff rate, exclusively enjoyed by favored countries. (3) The tariff rate applicable to other foreign countries, which is higher than the current external tariff rate.</p>

<p>Prime Minister MacDonald Will Visit Geneva</p>
<p>Seeking a Turnaround on the Disarmament Issue</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th: When Prime Minister MacDonald met with a delegation visiting the Foreign Office today to discuss disarmament, he mentioned that he and Foreign Secretary Simon may visit Geneva to achieve a better understanding among the various countries. Among the delegation were leaders from various churches, who strongly urged that the work of the disarmament conference be accelerated. Archbishop of Canterbury Lang delivered a speech, saying that they hoped for a strict ban on tanks, artillery, submarines, military aircraft, and warships over 10,000 tons, and asked that Britain cooperate very closely with the United States in disarmament efforts. Foreign Secretary Simon, who was also present, replied with the same words as the Archbishop, and recalled that a "qualitative" disarmament was actually initiated by the British delegation to the disarmament conference. Prime Minister MacDonald then delivered a speech, saying that the understanding between Britain and the United States regarding disarmament cannot be broken without a major spiritual change. The two countries are now trying to create a similar situation in Europe. He welcomes the moral pressure placed on disarmament, but advocates of peace must not only think from a moral perspective, but also clearly understand other possibilities in the overall situation.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 20th: News from London: The plan for a four-power disarmament preparatory conference is now considered to have been practically shelved. Currently, the British government is considering two options: one is a conference of France, Italy, and Britain to consider Germany's demands for equality; the other is to continue the disarmament conference as before, proceeding with theories close to those of Germany, even if Germany does not join. Although the second option, especially continuing the disarmament conference, seems to be more agreeable to the French government, it is heard that the British government still advocates holding a three-power conference and making concessions to Germany, with only certain reservations attached. Furthermore, French newspapers revealed today that during a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday, Herriot, in response to questions from members, expressed that in the event that Germany unilaterally abolished the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and expanded its military, France has no intention of using force, but will submit the matter to the International Court of Justice for public judgment, and explained the reasons why France previously insisted on Germany paying the final installment of reparations at the Lausanne Conference, due to pressure from the United States on the old Allied powers. According to Herriot's words, it has caused shock to the world and is expected to cause extremely important repercussions.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 20th: The German election campaign has already begun. All parties, from the far right to the far left, are attacking the German cabinet's diplomatic approach, saying that Germany is in an isolated position. Centrist party leader Bishop Gallas attacked General Schleicher, saying that when Germany submitted a document regarding equality of armament to France on August 29, Schleicher made various inappropriate declarations and subsequent verbal expressions. The criticisms of the Socialist Party and the Communist Party are different from the criticisms of the National Socialist Party, but regardless of party affiliation, all consider the verbal expressions of cabinet members' diplomatic policies to be erroneous. The extreme left is very regretful that the arms race is about to begin again. As for the cabinet's use of various slogans to consolidate its domestic political position, all parties unanimously condemn it.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Public Telegram <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Telegram from Xining: All newspaper offices are hereby informed that the Qilian Yushu area of Hainan is the throat of Qinghai and Kangding and the shield of the Southwest. Since March of this year, Tibetan troops have been rampant, taking advantage of the weakness of our Yushu defense forces to break into the border, occupy our territory, massacre our people, and commit arson, murder, and looting to the extreme. Their behavior is completely inhumane. Bu Fang believes that the Tibetan side is also one of the five major ethnic groups and wants to treat them peacefully, unwilling to resort to arms. Therefore, he requested the Qinghai Provincial Government to send personnel to appease them, hoping they would realize their mistakes, withdraw their troops, and seek a return to their old harmony. However, the Tibetan troops, led by Wang Qianbu, relied on their backers, were obsessed with aggression, and not only refused to listen to reason, but also mobilized heavy troops and launched the first attack, besieging Jiegou for several months. The defenders of Jiegou, led by Ma Zai and Ma Biao, were outnumbered and weak, but still hoped for peace, ultimately adopting a defensive posture. When there was no hope for peace and supplies and ammunition were exhausted, they were forced to resist. For national defense and for the sake of the people, Bu Fang believed that losing Yushu would endanger Qinghai, and if Qinghai was in turmoil, then half of the Northwest would also be in unrest. Therefore, he dispatched his troops, including Regimental Commander Lu and Brigade Commander Ma, to successively depart to aid Yushu. The officers and soldiers did not shy away from the thousands of miles of miasma-filled wilderness, and after making efforts to break the enemy's siege of Jiegou, they restored all the lost territories of La Xiu, Da Xiao Su Mang, and Ang Qian in the shortest possible time. Taking advantage of the victory, they advanced to attack the Dangtouke and other temples under the jurisdiction of Kangding. The enemy concentrated on important locations, and then attacked Zhengke. They are currently moving to assist the Sichuan army in crossing the river to jointly attack Changdu. If the borders of Kangding are completely restored, a telegram will be sent to the central government for instructions. Bu Fang hopes that the Dalai Lama will awaken, approve the restoration of the land and sovereignty of the Panchen Lama, and that both sides will reaffirm their old friendship, remain as citizens of the party and country forever, and consolidate the border of Jiangbei as securely as a rock. This is what Bu Fang silently prays for day and night. I respectfully present the details of the recapture of the lost territories of Hainan and the military details of the planned joint capture of Changdu by telegram to the entire country to clarify the truth, and I hope to receive instructions so that I can follow them. Commander Ma Bufang of the Southern Qinghai Border Defense Garrison bows and signs.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Future Record of the Japan-U.S. Naval War (Continued) <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>General Pollard, a hawkish admiral, is a scholar of war theory. During World War I, he created his own unique strategy. His tactics were instructed by the German military strategist General Graf Schlieffen, who studied the [Five-Percent Advantage Ratio N-Squared Method] of warfare. The mathematical basis of his warfare, researched by Japanese scholar Dr. Nomura, is explained as follows:</p>
<p>If Army A is N1 and Army B is N2, and the two armies engage in combat, then the defeat time of N2 can be calculated.</p>
<p>According to this calculation method, after the first salvo of a 60% navy, it can be completely annihilated in 27 minutes. Therefore, in the Washington and London Conferences, the ratio of Japan's navy being 6 and the United States' navy being 10 was stipulated. This is the implication of the logical strategist General Pollard, who confuses strategy with the mathematical formula of the N-squared method. He believes that with an advantage rate of 67%, he can definitely defeat Japan. Now, Pollard wants to implement a creative strategy to force the Japanese navy to be 60%, so the London Naval Treaty can be renamed the Pollard Treaty. The aforementioned ["Wheel Formation"] is the application of [the formula of the N-squared method to the fleet's ocean-crossing method. However, the U.S. Navy is most afraid of this formation, which is [the method of preserving the fighting power of battleships] in the event of a surprise attack en route by the Japanese submarine fleet. Originally, the fleet sequence during ocean-crossing operations, including the combined supply units, would reach 30 nautical miles or more. In order to counter a surprise attack by the enemy fleet in this sequence, we must deploy a search column. However, the distance of this column 200 nautical miles ahead of the U.S. fleet, the distance of the search column team is a maximum of 25 nautical miles in terms of visibility. We use ten frontline cruisers, and even at night, due to the narrow field of vision, we have to deploy a double search column, so we place another eight cruisers in the second search column. However, the enemy, with a superior cruiser fleet, will definitely attempt to destroy a part of our Japanese search column, or the enemy will infiltrate submarines to attack our main fleet. At this time, we can use light cruisers to defend against it. In 1928, General Hughes explained the wheel formation at the Senate Naval Committee and requested a budget for building warships. In 1930, Admiral Pollard supplemented Hughes's opinion, planning to deploy 8-inch gun cruisers in the search column and use 6-inch gun cruisers in the wheel formation. According to this plan, the United States is confident that it can win the battle in the Pacific. Although the Japanese navy has a defensive plan in terms of war objectives and military strength, we consider this wheel formation to be extremely dangerous. Why? According to the views of naval strategists, the wheel formation is originally a cautious defensive formation. If it points its cannons at us and moves out of the Hawaiian base, it will fall into the operating range of the Japanese navy. At that time, the sea area hundreds of nautical miles east of 囗囗囗 Island and 囗囗 coast will be an extremely dangerous area for the U.S. Navy, and the movement of Japanese submarines, the deployment of mines, the activity of surprise attack forces, and the progress of the Japanese main fleet will be difficult to understand, and the direction of progress will be unclear. Then the U.S. Navy will definitely feel greatly confused. Recalling the World War, Admiral Jellicoe of Britain led a fleet twenty times superior to that of Beatty's, but during the Battle of Jutland, he was deeply afraid of a night attack by German submarines. Moreover, the actual numbers of the Japanese and U.S. navies are not much different. The U.S. Navy's expedition of more than 3,000 nautical miles, after several days and nights of waves on the ocean, is mentally exhausted, and the instability of its combat power is conceivable. From this point of view, although the U.S. Navy has an attacking force, it has to take a defensive posture in the Western Pacific theater. This so-called wheel formation is actually a formation destined for defeat. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Rumored to Have Summoned Representatives from Both Liu Factions to Inquire About Sichuan Matters</p>
<p>Both Sides Engage in Main Force Contact in Eastern Sichuan</p>
<p>Correspondence from Hankou: The conflict between the two Liu factions in Sichuan Province has been brewing for a long time. Both sides are poised and ready for a decisive battle. For the past half-month, the situation has been getting more serious day by day. After unofficial contact between the two sides, a real battle by the main forces is taking place. This time the conflict between the two armies initially took place in the Shunqing, Wusheng, and Liemianxi areas. Then the 24th Army of Liu Wenhui concentrated in Zizhong and Neijiang, with Zhang Zhihe, commander of the 1st Division, as the commander of the southern route, Chen Hongwen, commander of the 2nd Division, as the commander of the northern route, and Xia Zhongshi, commander of the 3rd Division, as the commander of the central route. The 21st Army of Liu Xiang concentrated in the eastern Sichuan area, with Tang Shizun, commander of the 1st Division, as the commander of the central route, Wang Zuanxu, commander of the 2nd Division, as the commander of the northern route, and Pan Wenhua, commander of the Training Division, as the commander of the southern route. And the matter has become more extensive. Liu Wenhui has also withdrawn the Xikang defense army, and Liu Xiang has also withdrawn the troops suppressing bandits in Hubei to increase the strength of the fighting force. Although both sides are still trying their best to deny this, the troops of Guo Xun stationed in Hubei have indeed returned to Sichuan, and the office of the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River stationed in western Hubei has also been uniformly abolished, which can no longer be concealed. Once the deployments of both sides are completed, contact will be made. It is reported that Luo Zezhou's troops suffered a slight setback. The center of the battle has moved from the Shunqing area to places such as Chuanjin and Yongchuan. According to reports from Sichuan, the front teams of both sides have indeed made contact, and the main battle is about to begin. It is still difficult to predict how far it will expand in the future. In summary, the outbreak of this war can be divided into seven periods: the first is the preparation period for both sides, which was long before a month ago. Both sides did not admit to preparing for war. The second is the period of mutual attacks, which was at the end of last month and the beginning of this month. Both sides reported to the government, each claiming to be the troublemaker. The third is the period of central restraint, and both sides expressed their compliance, and said that even if the conflict started by others, they would not return a single shot. The fourth is the period of provocation by both sides, that is, contact in places such as Shunqing and Wusheng, which was in the early part of this month. Both sides have fought preliminary battles. The fifth is the period of proposals by second-level generals, with the second-level generals proposing a plan to resolve the Sichuan situation through the Suining Conference. The sixth is the period of the central government sending senior officials, but since no one is willing to take on this important task, they have not yet been assigned. The seventh is the recent period of the outbreak of the great war, and the Sichuan situation has become even more difficult to handle. Chiang Kai-shek, chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, is paying close attention to the internal strife in Sichuan Province and has strictly ordered both sides to avoid conflict, and has said "Taking care of the Sichuan situation is the way to maintain the country." Currently, due to the tense situation, it is reported that at 5:00 PM on the 20th, he summoned Wu Jinhang, representative of Liu Wenhui, and Qiu Jia, representative of Liu Xiang, at the Yihé Village residence to inquire about Sichuan matters, and also telegraphed Xu Zhongqi and others from the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee to come to Hankou to inquire about internal conditions in detail so as to resolve the Sichuan situation as soon as possible. According to the telegram from Xu and others, they have already taken the Yongnian ship eastward from Chongqing on the 19th and are expected to arrive in Hankou around tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

<p>The Administrative Office Urges the Establishment of Yuekou, Advancing to the Front Lines When Necessary</p>
<p>Before Departing, He Pays Respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Seeks Instructions</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Kuang Jixun's remnant bandits, after suffering a disastrous defeat, were led by Xu Xiangqian and Cai Shenxi, dispersing and fleeing in different directions. Cai's bandits fled to Anhui province, where they were surrounded and suppressed by the troops of Shangguan Yunxiang and Hao Mengling, and the matter was expected to be resolved. However, the bandits led a large force, crossed the Pinghan Railway, and fled into the territory of Suixian County in northern Hubei, where they joined forces with He Long's remnant bandits. Although they were ambushed along the way by the Nationalist army and suffered heavy losses, their ambition to stage a comeback has not diminished. The local military authorities, in order to thoroughly eliminate the remnant bandits, have redeployed their forces, adopting a large-scale encirclement and suppression strategy. Heavy troops have been stationed in the areas of Pinghan City, Xiaogan, Huayuan, Guangshui, Wusheng Pass, and Xinyang, both to protect the railway and to threaten the bandits. In addition, the two divisions of Wei Lihuang's command, led by Zhuang Fusheng and Li Mo'an, as well as the 51st Division led by Fan Shisheng, the 44th Division led by Xiao Zhichu, the 41st Division led by Zhang Zhenhan, and the 34th Brigade led by Luo Qijiang, have been dispatched to encircle and suppress the bandits in different directions. Chiang, Li, and Xiao's three divisions have already arrived in Suixian County, Fan's division has arrived in Yicheng, Zhang's division has crossed the Xiang River and marched north from Jingzhong, and Luo's brigade is stationed on the border between Sui and Zao, simultaneously launching attacks on the remnant bandits. He Chengjun has also been ordered to go to supervise the troops. He returned to Hankou from southern Hubei, and his old illness relapsed. He has now recovered somewhat and has dispatched Yang Yadong, a senior staff officer of the Pacification Headquarters, staff officer Min Wenhui, secretary Li Peng, adjutant Wen Zhenshen, quartermaster Zhu Xiangwen, and a company of military police on the evening of the 19th, taking the Han Chuan and Jing Hua steamboats, to depart for Yuekou first, to organize the administrative office. On the morning of the 20th, at 9:00 AM, He went to Yihua Village to pay respects to Chiang Kai-shek, the chairman, to seek instructions. In the afternoon, at 2:30 PM, he went to Wangjiadun Airport, taking the No. 6 aviation team's transport plane, the Douglas, and flew to Yuekou. The plane returned to Hankou at 5:30 PM. According to reports, He arrived at Yuekou at 4:00 PM. It is heard that He's trip to Yuekou is to discuss with Xu Yuanquan the aftermath of the suppression in central Hubei. After a brief stay, he will go to the front lines to command. The administrative office will be temporarily located in Yuekou and will be moved to the front lines when necessary. According to He's words to visitors before his departure, he said, "A few days ago, I went to Longgang, originally planning to go to the counties of southern Hubei to inspect the local reconstruction and to discuss relief measures for the recovered bandit areas with Division Commander Guo Rudong. Later, I returned to Hankou for medical treatment due to illness, so I entrusted the pacification and suppression matters to Division Commander Guo, together with Commander Zhang Gang and Brigade Commander Li Dingwu, for proper handling. There are now no traces of bandits in southern Hubei, and the local area is very peaceful. Given some time, it will not be difficult to restore the original state. Now, because the recovered bandit areas in central Hubei urgently need relief, I am specially going to inspect and to discuss the aftermath with Army Commander Xu Yuanquan. As for Xu Xiangqian's bandit gang, after being severely suppressed by the Nationalist army in eastern Hubei, their strength is limited. After fleeing west, they were intercepted by Luo Qijiang's brigade. Although they attempted to join forces with He Long's bandits, they will find it difficult to survive. Now, Wei Lihuang, Xiao Zhichu, and Fan Shisheng's troops have separately pursued and blocked them. I will go to command when necessary. The remnant bandits are now surrounded on all sides, and it should not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop." It is heard that He will stay for a while on this trip, and the date of his return has not yet been determined. (October 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">A Major Fire in Qingdao's Slums <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Burning Over Three Hundred and Sixty Households</p>
<p>More Than Fifteen Hundred Victims</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: In this city, fires occur almost every month, sometimes several or even dozens of times. However, most of the affected households are business firms, and eight or nine out of ten have fire insurance, so even if they encounter such accidents, they can still cope. Unexpectedly, last night (the 18th), at around 7:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the slum of Xiling Dirty Ditch, burning over three hundred and sixty households. The victims are now sleeping in the streets, and more than fifteen hundred people have been rendered homeless. The tragedy is unprecedented and is truly a catastrophe. The circumstances of the fire and the relief measures are described below:</p>
<p>Location of the Fire: The area around Xiling Dirty Ditch is where the poor are concentrated, and the houses are all made of wood, making them highly susceptible to fires. A fire occurred there last spring, burning over two hundred households. Subsequently, the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus, in order to prevent fires and improve the appearance of the city, ordered the residents to move out and demolish all the wooden houses to build affordable housing. However, the residents have repeatedly delayed and have not yet moved. Last night, at 6:30 PM, in the Hexing neighborhood on the west side of the area, a carpentry shop owned by a contractor surnamed Wang had a large amount of timber piled up. Due to the carelessness of a cook named Ning in preparing food, the wood chips and shavings caught fire. In addition, the weather has been dry and arid recently, and the fire quickly spread with the help of the wind, becoming uncontrollable. The wooden houses in the area are densely packed and connected end to end, making it very easy for the fire to spread. In an instant, the flames soared into the sky, but fortunately, it was still early, and men, women, and children were able to escape, avoiding being buried in the fire.</p>
<p>Relief Efforts: When the fire broke out, the North China Match Company in Dongzhen also accidentally caught fire at the same time, and the fire brigade had already rushed to put out that fire. It was not until 7:20 PM that the fire brigade returned, but by then the fire had already become raging and impossible to extinguish. As a result, all the wooden houses were reduced to ashes. The men, women, and children who escaped from the fire were scattered on the nearby roads, and the cries of women and children were unbearable to hear. Chu Zhen, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Yu Jinhe, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Sun Bingxian, the Director of the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau, all arrived at the scene to maintain order. The chiefs and police officers of the First and Second Branches also turned out in full force and made considerable efforts to maintain order in the fire zone and to rescue the victims. It was not until around 10:00 PM that the fire gradually subsided.</p>
<p>Damage Assessment: According to the post-incident investigation by the local district office, the area west of Guancheng Road is Dirty Ditch, which is divided into Guancheng Fifth Road. Starting from the corner of the cattle yard of the slaughterhouse company and heading south, Guancheng Second Road, from No. 30 to the intersection of Tengxian Road, extending to No. 270, a total of over three hundred and sixty households were destroyed, and more than fifteen hundred men, women, and children were rendered homeless and urgently need relief. Although the residents in the area are all poor, they have lived there for seven or eight years, and about half of them had household possessions worth four or five hundred yuan, but none of them had fire insurance.</p>
<p>Relief Arrangements: The Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus, deeply sympathetic to the plight of the poor residents who have suffered such a tragedy, have jointly dispatched personnel to make arrangements for relief in the disaster area. Today, they have begun to register the number of affected households and are temporarily housing the victims in the cattle yard of the slaughterhouse company on Guancheng Road. The manager of the company has voluntarily donated 600 yuan, giving each person 4 jiao to maintain their current livelihood. Other relief issues will be handled after a thorough investigation.

<p>A General Reduction of 30% in Grain Tribute Throughout the County: This year's autumn harvest has been assessed, and the Director of the Finance Bureau has personally inspected the various townships in accordance with regulations. A meeting was held at the county government on the 18th, inviting local representatives to discuss and decide on a general reduction of 30.3% in the county's grain tribute, with an actual collection of 66.7%. The matter has been jointly submitted by the county government and the Finance Bureau to the provincial authorities for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Villagers Riot to Protect Temple: The Shisi Security Corps of this county, due to a lack of funds, previously removed the chessboards in front of the Huchang Temple and converted them into telegraph poles. Forty temple trees and the surplus rent from the temple fields were allocated to the corps' expenses. Upon hearing this news, villagers gathered several hundred people the day before yesterday to protect the temple, demanding that the destroyed statues, chessboards, and temple trees be assessed and compensated. They first went to the home of Zhang Shushi, the head of the branch corps, but he was not there, so they went to the home of the secretary, Zhang Jiong, and destroyed his belongings. They then went to the homes of the corps leader, Yu Huimin, and Yang Lin, and set fire to their houses. The township chiefs, Lu Shouzhi and Wang Yangtian, and the temple directors, Yang Ziting, seeing the disaster they had caused, came forward to mediate. As a result, the Security Corps compensated Huchang Temple 130 yuan. The remaining judicial matters are being handled separately in court.</p>

<p>Telegrams Requesting the Lifting of the Rice Embargo and the Abolition of Excessive Taxes: The Shanghai Local Association, concerned that the low price of grain was affecting the rural economy, which has a significant impact on the entire society, specially dispatched representatives and invited commercial leaders from rice-producing counties in the interior of Jiangsu Province to hold a meeting in Wuxi on the 17th and 18th. They resolved to request the government to lift the ban on rice exports, impose import duties on foreign rice, abolish excessive taxes, and stop foreign wheat loans. Yesterday, Mu Ouchu and others, who were present at the meeting, jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Industry, with the following original telegram: [In Shanghai and Jiangsu, due to the excessively low price of rice, farmers and merchants are in distress. The Shanghai Local Association has initiated a special invitation to local officials from various rice-producing counties in Jiangsu Province to hold a joint meeting in Wuxi County on the 17th and 18th of this month. After two days of lengthy discussions, the written proposals and the purpose of the meeting were summarized, and it was unanimously agreed that, speaking for Jiangsu, the rice embargo should be lifted as soon as possible. It should first be implemented in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to facilitate circulation, and the county governments and water and land police should be ordered to provide immediate and effective protection and should not cause any delays. It is also requested that the central government promptly implement import duties on foreign rice and issue orders to all provinces to abolish rice</p>
<p>permits and other excessive taxes that hinder domestic circulation. Regarding foreign wheat loans, it is hoped that the government will listen to public opinion, stop negotiations, and cancel the process. However, if there is any smuggling or covert transportation of rice abroad, strict prohibition and punishment should be enforced. The meeting's opinions were unanimous, and this special telegram is sent for your consideration and implementation. We are anxiously awaiting your instructions.]</p>
<p>Beef Merchants Petition for Lifting the Ban: Beef merchants from various counties such as Jiangsu Province, Wuxi Jin Wanxing, Yang Yongxing, and Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Kunshan, etc., jointly went to Nanjing's Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Ministry of Industry, Zhenjiang Provincial Party Headquarters, Provincial Government, Department of Industry, and Department of Civil Affairs, and other nine organizations, to submit documents to request the opening of the beef market, citing that the implementation of the ban was ineffective, that the slaughter of draft cattle had already exceeded the permitted limits and was rampant, harming agriculture, that Japanese enemies were taking advantage of the situation to purchase beef to supply their troops, endangering the nation and the people, and hindering the fundamental agricultural industry. They listed twelve methods to save the situation. It is now heard that the authorities have approved the slaughter of vegetable cattle and the prohibition of draft cattle in order to protect farmers and merchants.</p>

<p>Leader of Merchant Corps Executed for Colluding with Bandits: In the area around Yuantuan Village in the northern countryside, bandits have been rampant in recent months. Because the leader of the merchant corps in that village, Yu Junchen, colluded with them, they carried guns in teahouses and restaurants during the day and formed gangs at night to commit murder and arson. The people repeatedly went to the county to file charges. Magistrate Wang negotiated with Ni Rongxian, the head of the Second Security Regiment, to send troops to surround and search the village. The bandits resisted fiercely. In addition to killing the bandit leaders Zhu Wuzang, Wang Xiaoba, Xiang Yikai, Wu Kefa, and Xiang Yizhi on the spot, they also captured 22 people, including the leader of the merchant corps, Yu Junchen, the bandits Wang Chengming and Liu Shitian, and Li Chengshi. After strict interrogation by Magistrate Wang, Yu admitted to colluding with and harboring bandits, Wang and Liu directly admitted to repeatedly committing robberies, and Li Chengshi directly admitted to being a bandit. All were sentenced to death. On the 16th, the four prisoners were paraded through the streets and then taken to Caidatang for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>Sir, I am writing to you regarding the report (Nanjing telegram) in your newspaper on the 14th, which stated that the person in charge of our office said that the Fujian Provincial Defense Army was plotting to resist our army and that the newly formed Second Division, led by Lu Xingbang, was also planning to join the Provincial Defense Army. This news is completely false. The person in charge of our office did not make such statements, and the Fujian Provincial Defense Army and the newly formed Second Division have not joined forces to resist our army. We are concerned that people outside may misunderstand the truth, so we are specially requesting that your newspaper correct this matter as soon as possible. Thank you for your attention. 19th Route Army Office in Nanjing, October 19th.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Luo Jialun, President of National Central University, Gives a Lecture <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Forming an Organic National Culture</p>
<p>(Part 3)</p>
<p>Speaking of an organic national culture, we must especially mention its most important aspect: first, everyone must have a shared awareness of revitalizing the Chinese nation. Today, we have reached a crossroads of life and death. If we are content to perish from this point, there is nothing to say. Otherwise, we must strive hard, seek life from death, and revitalize our nation. Each of us should strive under this shared awareness. Second, we must ensure that the efforts of all parts of the culture become coordinated with each other under this shared awareness. If the various parts cannot be coordinated, they will inevitably become scattered and unsystematic, leading to mutual conflicts and negating all the forces. Therefore, whether studying literature, science, engineering, agriculture, law, or education, all should be properly coordinated, with a consistent spirit and orderly steps, to move towards the common goal of establishing a national culture. Schools have been established in China for many years, but the results have been scattered and disordered due to improper allocation, especially because there is no shared national awareness to dominate them, so various efforts do not cooperate with each other. As a result, they not only fail to achieve the effect of cooperation and progress but also criticize each other and achieve nothing. Now, the number of university professors and students in the country is already limited. If they cannot work together towards the goal of building a national culture, it is a great loss to the nation. If this continues, it will inevitably reduce and even eliminate the vitality of the nation. People scold us for being an unorganized country, and we should be pained by this. But what we feel is not only political disorganization but also the disorganization of the entire society, especially the disorganization of culture. In the future, if we want to make China an organized country, we must quickly create an organized national culture, that is, an organic national culture. I used the historical facts of Germany above to illustrate the importance of our mission, but it is not to ask everyone to learn the so-called Prussianism but to emulate their efforts to create an independent national spirit from culture.</p>
<p>If we want to bear the aforementioned mission, we must cultivate a new style of learning. Whether president, faculty, or students, we must strive to shift the atmosphere, from the atmosphere of one school to the atmosphere of the entire country. Administrative affairs cannot be abandoned, but we run schools not just for administrative affairs, not to do things without a purpose. If we only talk about administration, it is best to ask foreign firms and compradors to run the university. We must have lofty ideals as goals of effort, believing that the success of ideals is greater than the success of anyone. Any personal sacrifice is worthwhile for the sake of ideals. I believe that if a new style of learning can be cultivated, our mission can be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Achievements of the Special Contracted Farmland in Xinxun Village, Wuxian County <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxian County Shanzhen Bridge Rural Improvement Association has been managing the cooperative rice paddies and specially contracted farmlands near the association. Under the practical guidance of the Agricultural Affairs Department, Zhu Mengle and Wang Gongpei, the crops are developing excellently and are now being harvested in order. The yield is over three shi (a unit of dry measure), which is much better than ordinary farmland. It is heard that the chairman of the association, Zhang Yixiang, and Yao Huiquan from the Shanghai Vocational Education Society, recently went to Tangwan to inspect and verified with the farmers that each ear of grain has as many as 222 grains, with the fewest having 180 to 190 grains. The results have broken records. Yao personally broke off several ears and took them back to the Vocational Education Society for display. The association is now also carrying out specially contracted wheat fields, and farmers are participating even more enthusiastically.</p>

<p>After the triangle swimming, the Egyptian Xue Mange first performed. This year's Olympic high-dive champion, Smith, followed with various skills, dozens of types in all, all kinds of wonders, things that people cannot do. The movements were clear and beautiful, but because the Youth Association lacked high-diving equipment, Smith had the sigh of a hero without a place to use his skills. His friend Xue Mange was good at springboard diving, which was more outstanding. Finally, the two performed comical swimming, and performed beginner swimming and diving, which was funny and cute, causing applause non-stop. It ended at 11:00 PM. It is scheduled to be performed publicly again at West Youth again at 11:00 AM tomorrow, only to entertain male and female students of the school, no admission tickets required. There will be another performance at West Youth on Monday night.</p>

Therefore, the result was reported as third by West Youth's officer Tuo Ping.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Davidson's First Lecture on Football Refereeing <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Responsibilities and Powers of Football Referees (Continued)</p>
<p>The referee cannot condone tolerance</p>
<p>I will now tell you one sentence in the competition rules that referees must pay close attention to, which is [The referee cannot condone tolerance in his work], and there is nothing more related to the referee or extremely difficult than this sentence. If the referee actually carries out condoning tolerance, then the audience, players, staff, etc. will regard the referee as either weak and incompetent, or completely incomprehensible to the game. Sometimes, because of condoning, unwilling to implement Article 9 and Article 17 (according to the penalty for a twelve-yard kick), unknowingly, a bad impression occurs, that is, the referee gives one party convenience, and the other party does not have it, or one player is penalized with a twelve-yard kick, and the other party's player commits it, then he is tolerated.</p>
<p>Once a decision is made, it must be upheld</p>
<p>One more important point, I would like to bring to your attention, is that a referee must have a faithful and impartial judgment. Once a judgment has been made, even if the sky is about to fall, it must be upheld, and it must never be changed. Do not make a mistake in one judgment, and then try to make it average, and give the other party a favorable judgment. Players can forgive one mistake, but if this method is adopted to average the mistake, then the referee's trust will be completely lost from now on. Who is without fault? I also dare not say that there are no mistakes on the field, and not subject to criticism. It is more necessary to determine the handling of the game based on the referee's own observations and opinions, and never to handle it based on the opinions of observers, players, or staff.</p>
<p>Once decided, uphold it</p>
<p>Enforcing a referee has no distinction in rank</p>
<p>There is no distinction in rank in executing a referee, although there may be different standards, each referee's responsibility is to implement the rules of the game with a courageous and fair spirit. There should be no distinction in rank in executing a referee or handling a competition. The rules of the game are equally applied to any competition, such as letting go of one player who fouls, and punishing other players who foul, which is unfair. Furthermore, it is not possible to relax responsibility in the first half and tighten it in the second half. The implementation of the rules of the game cannot be tight on one person and loose on another. It is equally powerful to implement it on any team, and the referee's first responsibility is to treat any team under the rule of law in an impartial manner.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The "Impossibilities" of a Scottish Referee <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Here is an introduction to the [Referee's Impossibilities] in the Scottish Referee's Manual: (1) Do not make the team wait for you, you must arrive on time; (2) Do not be impatient, be calm; (3) Do not instruct players on the field, you are the interpreter of the rules; (4) Do not change the decision afterwards to make it suitable for everything; (5) Do not value the audience, you can ignore them and make your will your will; (6) Do not refuse a polite request to explain a judgment, answer humbly, you can gain the trust of the players; (7)</p>
<p>Finally, do not forget the advanced referees in the training institute, they all rely on your protection and improvement.</p>
<p>No need to worry about newspaper coverage</p>
<p>There is no need to worry about newspaper reports. In my experience, very few newspaper reporters know the rules of the game in detail. Do not be elated by newspaper praise, and do not be discouraged by criticism. If sometimes it is appropriate for you to be diminished, you cannot maintain the same high standard, disappointing people, and therefore not praised as before for your handling.</p>
<p>Davidson's great delight</p>
<p>To conclude my words, my greatest delight in executing a referee is that when I look back at the Scottish competition fields of the previous session, I am honored and delighted that I have done my best to become an honorable referee. On the day I left Scotland, I told my colleagues this, I feel that I can hold my head high and leave the field without blushing, confident that I can live up to the name of a referee. I deeply hope to continue to maintain this spirit forever, and then when I put down the silver whistle, I can also say this and talk about my refereeing situation in Shanghai.</p>

<p>International Sailing Competition This year there are four teams participating. The most surprising thing is the addition of the Chinese team.

<p>This formation contains close passes, twists, blocking opponents, and dribbling to shoot, giving the opposing team a difficult-to-defend offensive method. This method was passed on to Pierce Works, who used to teach Bruins at the University of California in Los Angeles. It is recorded below:</p>
<p>Number 2 and number 3 each run forward. Number 2 receives the close pass from number 1 and immediately passes it to number 3. Number 5 runs out of the corner at the same time, and number 4 also runs from under the basket to the corner. Number 3 is open. Number 3 immediately turns around and passes the ball to number 5. When turning around, he also takes advantage of the momentum to block the guard of number 5. Number 5 should dribble straight to the basket while unguarded.</p>

Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Chongjie went to the North Railway Station to welcome them. After getting off the train, they returned to their residences to rest separately. Luo Wengan stayed at Chen Gongbo's residence.</p>

<p>The heads of various ministries of the Executive Yuan and the Secretary-General made an appointment to visit Wang at Chu Minyi's residence on Albert Road yesterday morning. Zhang Jingjiang, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, and Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua, first went to meet him at 9:15 AM. Zhang left after meeting Wang for about half an hour. Luo Wengan, Huang Shaoxiong, Chen Gongbo, He Yingqin, Gu Zhutong, Ye Chucang, and Gu Mengyu also arrived successively before 10:00 AM. From 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM, Zhu Peide, Song Ziwen, Chen Shaokuan, Liu Ruiheng, Peng Xuepei, and others continued to arrive. Wang received them from his sickbed. Mayor Wu Tiecheng arrived the latest. The meeting lasted for about two hours. In addition to reporting on the work of their respective ministries and expressing condolences, the heads of various ministries also asked Wang for instructions on the policy direction. They did not leave until 11:20 AM.</p>

<p>After leaving the Chu residence, Zeng Zhongming and Tang Youren met with reporters from various newspapers. They said that the visit of the heads of various ministries today was because Mr. Wang was about to leave the country, and they came to say goodbye and report on recent political affairs. Discussions on various issues such as diplomacy and politics were casual conversations and had no important significance.</p>

<p>Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin told reporters yesterday that the dispute between the two Lius in Sichuan has been stopped by the central government with a telegram. No personnel will be sent to Sichuan for the time being. In Shandong, Han has complied with the order to withdraw his troops and is awaiting the central government's disposal. Han's troops will retreat to the west of Weixian, and the five counties of Laiyang will be designated as Liu Shi's garrison. This is indeed the case. The opening date of the Third Plenary Session has been tentatively set for December 1st or 15th, and is awaiting final decision.</p>

<p>Around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhang Qun, representative of Military Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Zhao Pilian, representative of Yan Xishan, and Bai Yunti, a member of the Central Committee, visited Wang successively and talked for about 20 minutes. Zhao and Bai left first, and Zhang left after noon. Tang Shengzhi and others went to visit at 2:40 PM in the afternoon and talked for about an hour, leaving at 3:30 PM. At 4:45 PM, French Consul-General Melier also visited Wang to inquire about his departure date.</p>

<p>After the heads of various ministries left together at 11:10 AM, Zhang Yuejun, a member of the Central Committee, continued to talk due to other important matters, so he did not leave until after 12:00 PM. Reporters immediately rushed to ask about the meeting with Wang. According to Zhang, Military Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was unable to leave his military duties to come to Shanghai to see Wang off, so he telegraphed him to express his regards on his behalf. Recent rumors that Wang's departure was due to political disagreements were completely inaccurate. President Wang and Chairman Chiang have always cooperated as one person and jointly uphold the reason to set policies to serve the country. This time, Wang's trip to Germany is purely to take advantage of the three-month leave granted by the Central Government to go to recuperate with peace of mind. As for whether he can return to the country within the leave period, it depends on the situation after he arrives in Germany for medical treatment. It cannot be predicted at the moment. If the doctor can determine the source of the disease, prepare the medicine, and return to the country to take it, then Wang can return to the country before the leave expires.</p>

<p>Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Wengan arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and made the following statement to the reporters who visited him: "I (Luo self-identified) came to Shanghai this time because President Wang is leaving the country to recuperate and is about to depart. I came with my government colleagues to see him off and discuss the diplomatic situation. The Lytton Report is of course also one of the issues discussed." When a reporter asked what the government's attitude was towards the Lytton Report and whether it had decided on a policy, Luo said that President Wang had already pointed out the main points of the government's attitude towards the Lytton Report in his farewell speech. What I want to say now is that although the government's method of dealing with this case has been agreed upon, the application of it still needs to be adapted to circumstances, according to the situation. But my country has a firm principle that will never change, which is the four principles that I declared to China and foreign countries on August 28 this year. This statement has attracted the close attention of all countries in the world. The most important of these is [The reasonable way to resolve the current situation must be based on the letter and spirit of the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, and the sovereignty of China, while at the same time ensuring the permanent peace of the Far East is a necessary condition]. In short, the steps may vary according to the time, but the principles will remain consistent. What I can tell you today is the consistent principles that the government adheres to. As for the detailed steps, I am sorry that I cannot announce them at this time.</p>

<p>Wang's trip to Germany this time was granted three months' leave by the Central Government. During this period, Vice President Song will continue to act as President of the Executive Yuan. The previous report that the issue of the President of the Executive Yuan would be discussed at the Third Plenary Session, and that Mr. Sun Zhesheng would succeed as President, was questioned by a reporter from the Central News Agency, who met with a member of the Central Committee yesterday. According to the conversation, the date of the Third Plenary Session has been decided by the previous Central Standing Committee and will be convened on December 1st or 15th. There is no need to raise the issue of the President of the Executive Yuan for discussion. Wang's leave is entirely for medical treatment, and it is different from the rumors of negativity or disagreement. Therefore, the above-mentioned rumors are merely speculations and should not be believed. Regarding Mr. Wu Tiyun's trip north, there are also various speculations from the outside world. However, as far as I know, Mr. Wu expressed that the Central Government's attitude towards the League of Nations and the report of the investigation team was very proper, and his own opinions were consistent with the Central Government.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Wang Jingwei's Speech <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Wang issued the following statement last night: "(Question) I just saw your speech advocating unity and deeply criticizing local civil wars caused by conflicts over territory. This is indeed the common feeling of the Chinese people, but now civil wars are breaking out in Shandong and Sichuan. What are your thoughts on this?" "(Answer) The current situation of local warlords' separatism has not been completely broken, and the central government has not been able to reach a strong position. This is the current reality and cannot be denied. However, I think that the central government should be clear about right and wrong, distinguish between right and wrong, and start with persuasion, followed by coercion. If the people of the whole country can rise up to help the central government, then this kind of civil war can be stopped. My consultations with Chairman Chiang and President Song are roughly the same. I heard that the Shandong matter has turned around. The situation in Sichuan is complicated, even more than in Shandong. Sichuan's fertile land, large population, and abundant products are only used to support the warlords' separatism, which is really hateful. In February and March this year, the central government had a plan to order the generals in Sichuan to send troops to participate in the anti-Japanese and communist suppression, but unfortunately it was constrained by the status quo and could not be realized. In recent months, the border affairs of Xikang have not been settled, and although the military has repeatedly reported victories, it has not yet been completely successful. Suddenly, this civil war has broken out, and its impact on the border affairs is not small. As for the laughter and abuse from strong neighbors, the loss of international sympathy, and the current diplomatic relations, there is no need to say more. I think that the central government should strictly order the generals to defend their original defenses and wait for investigation, and at the same time send high-ranking officials to thoroughly investigate and determine the method, so that they can all abide by it. Those who do not obey orders should have their crimes announced and abandoned by the world." 6:00 PM on October 21</p>

<p>At 6:00 PM last night, Song Ziwen returned to Chu's residence to visit Wang and talked for an hour before leaving. Around 7:00 PM, Mr. and Mrs. Wang and their daughter, Mr. and Mrs. Chu Minyi, Zeng Zhongming, and others left Chu's residence in four cars. They boarded the ship once and then returned to Beijing to rest. They were allowed to board the ship at dawn this morning. The ship was docked at the China Merchants Bureau Wharf in Hongkou and was scheduled to set sail at 11:00 AM today.</p>

<p>Wang Jingwei's trip to France this time was arranged by Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of Railways, who personally went to the local French Postboat Company to purchase客客 for the André Lebon Postboat, a total of nine people, all special rooms. Wang himself occupied 特等 room number 3 alone, Mr. Wang's wife Chen Bijun and her daughter occupied one room, and secretaries and doctors each occupied one room, totaling over 10,000 yuan in boat tickets. In addition to his wife and daughter, Li Haoju, Chen Yun, and Chen Dachu, English and German secretaries, Dr. Knoll, a German doctor, and Luo Guanglin, Wang's attending doctor, are also accompanying Wang this afternoon. In addition, Zhang Fakui, commander of the Fourth Army, and Zeng Zhongming, of 鐵次, are also leaving Shanghai on the same ship. Zhang will go to Germany to study, and Zeng will see Wang off to Hong Kong and then return. Therefore, Wang's party, including Zhang Fakui, totals nine people.</p>

<p>Minister of Communications Chen Mingshu previously resigned and came to Shanghai, preparing to go abroad, but the Central Government has not yet approved it, so he is still nominally on leave. Because Chen is eager to go abroad, he sent another telegram to Acting President Song yesterday, firmly requesting approval of his resignation. The original telegram reads: Nanjing Executive Yuan Acting President Song Ziwen brother Xun Jian, I have resigned from the post of Minister of Communications for several months, and I plan to go abroad for a long-term recuperation. The preparation takes time, and although I have been granted leave in the meantime, it has long expired. I am deeply shocked and fearful to hold this name in vain and to suspend it for a long time. I am now making a desperate first trip and should order the removal of my post and announce a replacement to clarify responsibility. I am grateful and grateful. Brother Chen Mingshu kowtows.</p>

However, due to the inability to carry out reclamation work in winter, in addition to preparing the reclaimed land for active cultivation next spring, they have decided to first establish a woolen mill within the year, and are making every effort to prepare. After the team leader arrives, they will purchase machinery and other items and transport them to Baotou.</p>

<p>Jianghai Customs Announces Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The regulations on the issuance of consular certified cargo manifests by Chinese consulates abroad, previously approved by the Ministry of Finance, were implemented on August 18th by a public notice issued by the Jianghai Customs. Now, the Jianghai Customs, considering that there are still matters that should be noted in the regulations, issued Public Notice No. 1247 by the Commissioner of Customs, Luo Fude, yesterday, for the information of merchants, stating: "Regarding the matter of public notice, the regulations on the issuance of consular certified cargo manifests by consulates of the Republic of China abroad were announced on August 18th of this year. The following are the matters that should be noted regarding these regulations, for the information of all merchants. Special notice is hereby given. (1) The regulations stipulate that the minimum value of goods exempt from consular certification of cargo manifests is 200 yuan in national currency, which has now been stipulated to be equivalent to 110 customs gold units. Furthermore, the minimum value of goods exempt from consular certification of cargo manifests should be based on the Free on Board (F.O.B.) price, with the exception of goods imported from Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and other Japanese locations. The minimum loan value exempt from consular certification of cargo manifests remains 200 yuan in national currency, not 110 customs gold units. (2) Personal belongings carried by passengers, if not for the purpose of resale, do not require a consular certified cargo manifest, even if the value reaches or exceeds 200 yuan in national currency. (3) If, at the time of shipment, it is confirmed that the entire shipment is destined for a specific importer in a specific port in China, only one consular certified cargo manifest is required, regardless of how the goods are transshipped in batches upon arrival at Chinese ports. (4) For foreign goods transported into various trading ports in China via the Dalian Leased Territory, they should be required to present their certified cargo manifests. If products from the Dalian Leased Territory are transported into various trading ports, merchants may pay five customs gold units to the import customs to obtain a supplementary consular certified cargo manifest, and avoid penalties.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Representative of the Guizhou Provincial Government Arrives in Shanghai <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Guizhou Province Is As Peaceful As Ever</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that Mr. Xu Zhaoguang, the representative of the Guizhou Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing. Because of recent widespread rumors in Beijing and Shanghai about unrest in Guizhou and impending conflict between Wang and Mao, with differing accounts in newspapers, this reporter visited him yesterday to inquire about the truth. According to Mr. Xu, Guizhou is currently quite peaceful, with no serious situation. However, the recent return of former Chairman Mao from the province to Zunyi has caused various rumors. In reality, Mao, as a private citizen, occasionally leaving or entering the province has no bearing on the political situation. Furthermore, a recent telegram was received from Chairman Wang stating: "Secret: The airfield that this headquarters previously built in the Pingyuan Shao area of Qingzhen County has been completed. A telegram has been sent to Chairman Chiang requesting the dispatch of aircraft for test flights. A reply telegram has been received, stating that the Aviation Department has been ordered to handle it. Please urge them to do so nearby. Respectfully, Jia Lie." Furthermore, former Chairman Mao left the province the day before yesterday to travel, passing through areas such as Shuitianba and Zijiang. Letters are sent daily to inform us. In addition to ordering the troops stationed along the way to take good care of him, I have specifically heard, Jia Lie bows.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Telegrams from Various Parties Regarding the Sichuan War <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui's Telegram; Liu Wenhui's Telegram of the 16th to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Chiang, and various parties states: "Privately, internal strife does not cease, and foreign insults arrive repeatedly. The entire nation, from top to bottom, is heartbroken. Although Sichuan Province has been plagued by frequent years of unrest, it has fortunately achieved temporary peace. As one humbly entrusted with border defense, I am increasingly cautious. I have spared no effort to eliminate the seeds of chaos and seek governance. The military commanders of all armies, sharing these difficult and precarious concerns, also have the friendship of harmonious cooperation. And Liu Xiang, the commander of the 21st Army, who is stationed in Chongqing and bears greater responsibility, if he can cooperate fairly and sincerely, it will not be difficult to proceed step by step, to communicate upwards to the central government and to comfort the people downwards. Therefore, within the past few years, I have repeatedly traveled to Luzhou and Chongqing, going back and forth to negotiate, hoping for his acceptance. I have not hesitated to lay bare my sincerity and express my humility. The details of this process have already been reported to your government and are already known to you. Unexpectedly, there are ulterior motives that are difficult to fathom. Since the reorganization of the provincial government, the state of division has remained unchanged. The awakening period... In the army-garrisoned areas, once sincere advocacy is initiated, they will all cooperate to revitalize the situation. However, in the corner of eastern Sichuan, the original system is followed, and now it is even more intensified. I have always been an advocate for peace and have always been accommodating, fearing even the slightest dispute that would be scorned by those with understanding. Moreover, with the national crisis at hand and the Kangding affairs pressing, it is essential for the entire nation to unite in ceasing disputes and resisting foreign aggression. How can we allow the Sichuan that has been peaceful for several years to not focus on resisting foreign aggression but instead allow internal strife to develop, leading to reproach from the central government and loss of sympathy from the people? Yet, I do not know what Liu Xiang, the military commander, intends. With a heart to stir up chaos, he secretly ordered Luo Zezhou and Li Jiayu, two divisions, to suddenly launch a large-scale military action on the 1st of this month, crossing the border to attack Shunqing and Lidu, where my troops are stationed. I have truthfully and repeatedly reported the actual situation to your government on the Jiayuan and Shan days. Fortunately, I have received your clear understanding and successive telegrams ordering Military Commander Liu Xiang to take responsibility for stopping the action and ordering the troops under Li and Luo to retreat to their original defense and await the central government's decision. Furthermore, I have received numerous telegrams from all sectors of the party, government, military, and people within and outside the province, lamenting the wrongs of war and hoping for compliance with the order to cease hostilities. Those with even a little conscience should feel remorse. Upon investigation, it is also known that the central government is clear-sighted and that the instigator is difficult to hold accountable. Initially, they instigated Li and Luo to provoke me, hoping that if I retaliated, they could refer to it as a conflict between me and Li and Luo, and then ask the central government to take responsibility for stopping it, thereby taking advantage of armed mediation to gain profit. The reports, the telegrams between Liu Xiang and Li and Luo, can be reviewed and confirmed. Therefore, I respectfully obeyed the clear orders and retreated step by step, always strictly ordering my troops to defend their original positions. However, Li Jiayu's troops fiercely attacked Shuncheng on the Yu day, and some 21st Army troops, under the guise of Li and Luo's banners, mingled among them, assisting in the attack. On one hand, they picked on my shortcomings to confuse the public. On the other hand, they ordered their troops to launch simultaneous attacks on Yongchuan, Dazu, and Jiangjin, where my troops are stationed, expanding the war zone. This is truly something I cannot understand, and it is something the entire nation sighs in unison. I have diligently performed my duties day and night, and I believe that I have not offended Chongqing. Even if there are differences in political views due to different positions, I have always been tolerant and receptive to criticism. If I am found to be wrong, I will accept correction. Otherwise, I can report the facts to the central government, and it is not impossible to make them public. Why must I launch an unwarranted war, causing the central government to worry and the entire nation to criticize, laughing at foreigners and bringing disaster to the people during a time when the entire nation is against war? Furthermore, I have read the telegrams from Tang Shizun and other division commanders of the 21st Army, fabricating many names, creating regulations, and seeking the consent of various armies. Their intention to establish independent rule and disregard the central government, sparing no effort to resort to force and war, is now abundantly clear. The truth and falsehood can be seen in the telegrams from Chen Dingxun and other division commanders, which are clearly clarified. I will not reiterate the lengthy arguments. However, their fabrication of the situation to coerce the central government and their intention to deceive the central government in order to manipulate public opinion are particularly deceitful, and everyone can see it. At a time when the entire nation is calling for peace, I am working hard on the Kangding defense, but they are allowed to act willfully, destroying the overall situation and harming themselves. I say this with extreme pain and no tears to shed. Your judgment is clear, and your authority is decisive. Please investigate the cause of this incident and the locations of the two battles, and you will know that my words are not false. The responsibility lies where it belongs. Quickly issue strict orders to Military Commander Liu Xiang, ordering him to comply with repeated orders, stop Li and Luo, and hold them accountable for their due punishment. Also, strictly restrain his troops from using this as an excuse to launch a war and expand the battlefield. I am incompetent, causing a potential conflict among close relatives. I am ashamed of my lack of virtue and dare not tell others. However, I am also a military commander of the national army and a territorial official of a province. If those who disobey the orders of the central government are allowed to arbitrarily use force without being held accountable, and if a prompt decision is not made, discipline will be swept away, and the flames of war will increase, and there will be no end to it. Considering the innocent people calling and crying for an end to the war, I have no way to avoid it and cannot stand idly by. I only ask that you dispatch a senior official to Sichuan as soon as possible to implement the cessation of hostilities. If you are concerned that my allegations are not true, once investigated, the truth will be revealed, and the matter will be handled appropriately. Urgent words are presented with fear and trembling, not daring to express the extent of my shame and awaiting your orders. Liu Wenhui bows."</p>
<p>▲ Four Telegrams from Sichuan Generals; The Guowen News Agency reports that Liu Xiang's representative in Shanghai received four telegrams from Chongqing yesterday. The texts of the telegrams are as follows: (1) Deng Xihou's Telegram, Limited, to arrive immediately: "To Liu Duban Fugong of Chongqing, Liu Duban Jigong of Suiding, Yang Junzhang Zihui Brother of Guang'an, Liu Junzhang Zigian Brother of Chengdu, and Tian Junzhang Songyao Brother, all esteemed. Yesterday, the military and brigade commanders of the Han armies jointly sent a telegram proposing sixteen guiding principles for governing Sichuan, revealing righteousness. Every word is worth a thousand pieces of gold. I hope you will appreciate it. The matters advocated in it coincide with what I have prayed for morning and evening. My sincerity is expressed on paper, and I am deeply moved. I have read it thrice. Article 10 of the principles, which states that the practice of monopolizing and seeking private gain should be eliminated, and that leaders of various departments and party members should have the opportunity to participate, demonstrates impartiality and inclusiveness. I propose that all army leaders in Sichuan set a date to convene in Suining to stop the war and coordinate the terms, so that peace can be achieved immediately and great governance can be expected. Gentlemen, you are leaders of the people and are particularly eager for good governance. I earnestly hope that you will adopt this proposal and quickly convene a meeting to jointly save the situation in Sichuan. I express my sincere sentiments and await your wise instructions. Deng Xihou bows." (2) Liu Cunhou's Telegram, Urgent, to Liu Duban Fugong of Chongqing, and to all division commanders, commanders, and brigade commanders of the 21st Army: "I have received Fugong's telegram and the telegrams from Tang Shizun and others. The sixteen guiding principles for governing Sichuan, which you presented, and your request to go to Suining to stop the Sichuan war, are all essential points and I express my strong agreement. As for Fugong's proposal to jointly submit a telegram to the central government, please ask Fugong to draft it and include my name, and please send me a copy of the original telegram. Liu Cunhou bows." (3) Yang Sen's Telegram, National Emergency, to Liu Duban Fugong of Chongqing: "I have received your telegram. I admire and endorse your painful desire to love the country and save Sichuan, your adoption of the guiding principles for governing Sichuan in the joint telegram, and your advocacy of responsible leadership in submitting a joint telegram to the central government, as well as your willingness to hold a meeting on a fixed date to thoroughly implement the principles. Your direct words are loyal and fair. Please draft the joint telegram from your end and add my name so that the Sichuan situation can be resolved and the national crisis can be addressed. The party-state and the people of Sichuan will deeply rely on it. Yang Sen bows, with a clever seal." (4) Tian Songyao's Telegram, to Liu Duban Fugong, esteemed: "I have received your telegram urging me to quickly reply and support the joint telegram from the military and brigade commanders. I have already sent a telegram and informed you. Recently, Jin Kang sent a telegram, saying, 'I have received both the Shan and Xian telegrams. I have already telegraphed my support for the guiding principles for governing Sichuan proposed by the military and brigade commanders, and I have also telegraphed on the Xian day asking the leaders of the various armies in Sichuan to quickly set a date for a meeting in Suining to discuss and agree on the items and implement them in practice. I hope you will appreciate this. Please inform me of the date of the meeting as soon as possible.' I am specially informing you of this. Tian Songyao bows, Xiao."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Representatives of the Volunteer Army Support Association Go to Hangzhou <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Negotiate the establishment of a Zhejiang Provincial Support Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association previously received a letter from the United Association of National Salvation Groups of the Republic of China, requesting it to find ways to popularize the organization of Volunteer Army Support Associations to enhance its strength. At the 64th Executive Committee meeting, it was decided to appoint Executive Director Chu Huiseng to go to Hangzhou to negotiate the establishment of the Zhejiang Provincial Support Association. Mr. Chu left for Hangzhou yesterday with a letter. The following are two letters concerning this matter:</p>
<p>Reply to the National Salvation Association; The association replied to the United Association of National Salvation Groups of the Republic of China yesterday, stating: "Respectfully replying, we have received your letter of October 18th and are fully aware of the situation. Support for the Northeast Volunteer Army depends on the strength of the entire nation. We will certainly comply with your request to send personnel to various provinces to promote the establishment of Support Associations. We are now taking steps to proceed in various ways. We acknowledge your concern and earnestly hope to work together."</p>
<p>Letter to the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce; Mr. Chu Huiseng took a letter of introduction from the Shanghai Support Association to the Hangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Lawyers Association yesterday to contact the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Lawyers Association in Hangzhou. The letter stated: "We are writing to you because the Northeast has fallen for more than a year. The compatriots of the three provinces, unwilling to see their land change color, have resisted the Japanese invaders and formed volunteer armies. They have fought for the country and killed the enemy through years of hardship and danger, lacking sufficient military supplies internally and little external liaison and support. But with the spirit of perseverance and the courage to face death, they have always inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese invaders. If they can be fully supported, it will not be difficult to recover the lost territory. Our association has first advocated supporting the Volunteer Army to mobilize both domestic and foreign resources, but this matter is significant and must gather the national strength to mobilize together. The organization of Support Associations should be quickly popularized. In addition to Tianjin, Beijing, Chongqing, Fujian, and Xiamen, where it is already underway in Shanghai, Zhejiang is a wealthy area in the Southeast and a gathering place for talents. They will certainly not lag behind in resisting Japan, saving the country, and supporting the Volunteer Army. At the 64th Executive Committee meeting, it was resolved to appoint Mr. Chu Huiseng to be responsible for promoting the organization of the Zhejiang Provincial Support Association. We have long admired your association as leaders of Zhejiang and your enthusiasm for national affairs. We have specifically entrusted you with this letter and hope for your cooperation and vigorous promotion."</p>

<h3 id="e139">Citizens' Volunteer Army Forms Peddling Group After Demobilization to Sell Goods and Donate to the Volunteer Army <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Minde Factory Sacrifices Profits</p>
<p>Balancing Public and Private Interests</p>
<p>The Citizens' Volunteer Army for the Defense of Shanghai against the Japanese has demobilized and returned, and many of its members have lost their jobs. They have now organized a volunteer peddling group to sell goods, with 30% of the profits going to support the Northeast Volunteer Army. The local Volunteer Army Support Association is publishing this notice to introduce them. The following is the original text: [Notice from the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association Regarding the Volunteer Peddling Group Selling Minde Factory's Tiger Brand Yarn Rope and Donating the Profits to the Volunteer Army] Some Shanghai merchants participated in the Citizens' Volunteer Army for the Defense of Shanghai against the Japanese and fought the enemy for the country. Since the ceasefire and their return, their original positions have been taken by others, and they all need to find new livelihoods. They have organized a peddling group, now officially named the Volunteer Peddling Corps. The Minde Yarn Rope Factory has agreed to provide its Tiger Brand yarn rope, which is used by various factories and shops for bundling goods, to the group for peddling. After deducting the cost, the profits will be divided into ten parts, with three parts donated to the Northeast Volunteer Army and the remaining seven parts used for the living expenses of the peddling group. Minde Factory's yarn rope comes in two thicknesses, each bundle containing 6,000 or 12,000 feet of yarn rope, with a selling price of 5 yuan each. The quality is strong, and the colors are complete, making it very practical. Our association recognizes the difficult situation of the Volunteer Peddling Corps, who are still willing to support the Volunteer Army, and also appreciates the generosity and righteousness of the Minde Factory, which is sacrificing profits. Therefore, we are happy to introduce them and will stamp the order books. The group will also notify our association with one copy from the four-part order form to facilitate auditing and ensure prudence. We hope that major factories and shops will actively purchase their products, not only to promote national goods and maintain people's livelihoods but also to support the Volunteer Army in recovering lost territory, achieving multiple benefits in one stroke. Your consideration is greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Actively Opposing the Pork Tax in Jiangbei</p>
<p>The fresh pork industry associations of various counties in Jiangsu Province have reported that the business tax bureaus of Jingru and Tai counties in Jiangbei have suddenly established branch offices in various ports of those counties since September 21st of this year, totaling 16 offices, specifically to levy business taxes on pigs passing through. Initially, they sent police to extort money, and then they detained goods to force payment. Special letters were sent to industry associations in various counties to nominate representatives to come to Shanghai to form a joint office and actively resist. Recently, they decided to nominate more than 40 representatives to form a petition group to petition in Beijing and the provinces. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they held a farewell meeting at the association's headquarters. Representatives from various counties gave speeches of encouragement. Petition representative Xin Wenyao stood up to reply, stating that his colleagues would do their best to resist and strive to achieve the goal of abolishing the tax, and would not fail the expectations of everyone.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Movement for Wage Increase by Round Wood Workers <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Various round wood shops in this city, specializing in making wooden buckets and basins, employ workers whose wages are 3 jiao and 5 fen per day. The workers, believing that the cost of living has been increasing recently and that their wages are not enough to cover their expenses, have been requesting wage increases from their respective shop owners, without success. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, they convened workers from various shops in the north and south of the city at the First Spring restaurant outside the Old North Gate to discuss the matter, and invited shop owners to the meeting. A representative of the workers said that the wages of workers in the woodenware industry are 6 or 7 jiao per day, or at least 5 jiao, but the wages of the round wood workers are very low, only 3 jiao and 5 fen per day. If they stop working for one day, there is no income. With prices rising for everything, it is really difficult to support a family with their current wages. Today, we have specially invited the shop owners to come here to request a wage increase of 1 jiao per day. Please consider the workers' plight and grant our request. The shop owners, on the other hand, said that business is currently sluggish, business is small, the cost of goods is high, and it is difficult to increase prices, so they are barely surviving. The workers also know this, and the requested wage increase is too large, and it concerns all of the businesses and cannot be agreed to. The workers said that the requested wage increase of 1 jiao has been discussed publicly and is the smallest amount. The two sides discussed the matter for a long time, but there was no result. It is now decided to hold another meeting another day.</p>

<p>Will Convene Both Parties for Mediation</p>
<p>The stewards on the Yangtze River boats of the British-owned Taikoo Company have joined the Middle Cabin Branch of the Seamen's Union. Previously, the company's comprador suddenly requested the company's managers to limit the number of stewards on each boat to a maximum of 50 people and issued five service rules, causing the entire crew to express their dissatisfaction. They reported this to the Seamen's Union and petitioned the Central Government to strictly prohibit it. The day before yesterday, direct negotiations between labor and management broke down. The labor side then joined forces with stewards from other friendly boats and planned to petition the municipal government today (the 22nd). Yesterday, the Municipal Party Headquarters heard about this and, fearing that the labor strike would escalate, sent Dai Yongchan, a cadre from the People's Education Section, to investigate everything. Wei Kuisheng, a standing committee member of the union, met with him, reported the details, and requested assistance. Cadre Dai immediately expressed his acceptance and promised to convene both parties for mediation at a later date. Mr. Wei expressed his satisfaction and promised to automatically cancel today's petition.</p>

<p>The World News Agency translated Miller's Review (published today) as follows: "A certain foreigner in Shanghai, who is familiar with (or claims to be familiar with) all international conspiracies in this part of the world, reports that a kidnapping plot is being planned with Americans as victims. The purpose is to cause disputes between China and the United States. The details of this matter are not very clear, but the kidnapping seems to be carried out somewhere within a hundred miles of Shanghai. The person (or people) being kidnapped, if possible, will be [important figures] to make this a first-class shocking news story. The above information was conveyed to Miller's Review under [extreme secrecy], so we are unable to name the persons involved. Even the name of the informer must obviously be kept secret.

<p>The Japanese Post Office's European route mail ship Hakusan Maru arrived in Shanghai on the 19th. Because the Wayside Wharf was full, it changed its berth to the Osaka Wharf in Yangshupu. The Shengjing Maru ship of the Osaka Company also arrived in Shanghai from Dalian and Qingdao on the same day and docked at the same place. More than 30 bags of mail were transported on the ship. The post office sent three postal workers to the ship to pick them up and transport them to the main bureau for distribution.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Mother Serves Jail Time for Daughter <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Negligence of Female Warden</p>
<p>Mother and Daughter Conspire to Substitute</p>
<p>Song Bingzheng, a detective from the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police Department, cracked down on a smoking den at 273 Jiujiang Road on September 6th. Among the arrested opium smokers were two women from Jiangsu Province: Ji Qian, 39 years old, and Wang Bao, a young woman of marriageable age. They claimed to be mother and daughter. The police transferred the two women to the female detention center of the First Special District Court for detention. The next morning, Judge Feng interrogated them clearly. He sentenced Wang Bao to one month of imprisonment and a fine of 20 yuan. If she could not pay, she could serve the sentence in prison. Li Qian was not addicted to opium and should be released. After the judgment, the police were ordered to take them back to the detention center for the warden to execute the sentence. At that time, the acting warden was Ms. Ye Huihua. It is said that Ye was transferred from the Hangzhou prison. There is another warden position. On that day, it happened to be the day for inmates to meet with their families. Many family members of the inmates entered and exited the detention center. Li Qian and her daughter took advantage of this opportunity to discuss a plan to substitute one for another. When Ye called the roll, Li Qian impersonated Wang Bao, and Wang Bao impersonated Li Qian. As a result, the person who should have been in prison was at large, and the person who should have been released was imprisoned. As for the reason why they used this cunning trick, Li Qian considered herself old and had no ability to work. She was not addicted to opium, so being in prison would have no impact. However, if her daughter was in prison, not only would she suffer financial losses, but she would also suffer mentally. Therefore, she hoped to take a risk and get lucky. Unexpectedly, Ye was negligent and was deceived. Until recently, after the newly appointed female warden Shen Ying took office, she checked the female inmates in prison. When calling Wang Bao's name, she saw that the age on the register was 34 years old, but observing her appearance, although she was not old and frail, she did not look young either. Therefore, she became suspicious and interrogated her strictly. Li Qian knew that it was difficult to hide the truth, so she told the truth. Director Shen immediately reported to the warden of the Second Branch Prison, who forwarded it to Shen, the President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, who instructed the First Special Court to investigate the matter strictly. The prosecutor's office of the court commissioned Prosecutor Zhan Liangce to conclude the investigation. Ye Huihua could not escape the blame for negligence. Li Qian helped her escape, and she deserved the punishment even more. He filed a lawsuit for questioning, while Wang Bao has been engaging in prostitution since she was released. She would wait for customers every night on the streets and was arrested. After being sentenced by the court, she was handed over to the prosecutor's office. Prosecutor Zhan also investigated her and filed a public prosecution together with Ye and others, accusing Ye of violating Article 172, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, and Li Qian and Wang Bao of violating Article 170, Paragraph 1 and Article 171, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zhen opened the court and interrogated the three defendants. Qian Xunjiu, a lawyer from the Public Works Bureau, also attended the hearing. Ye Yaohua hired a lawyer to defend himself, admitting that there were many people entering and exiting on the day of the inmates' family visit, and he was negligent in checking, which led to this mistake. The defendant has been serving in the Hangzhou prison for many years and has never made a mistake. He requested leniency. The other two defendants admitted that they had colluded with each other to deceive and escape. Judge Wu then ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and await sentencing.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Gang Fight Among Workers at Dada Wharf <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Due to Refusal to Allow Scabs to Work</p>
<p>More Than a Dozen People Injured in the Fight</p>
<p>The dock workers in the Dada Wharf area of Nanshi have been managed by Foreman Zhang Jinkui. Whenever the Dada Steamboat Company's ships arrive at the port, Zhang dispatches a group of foremen to lead the workers to transport goods on the ships. However, whenever the work is busy, all the workers are not enough to handle it, so he recruits a group of scab workers from Pudong to help out in Puxi. Yesterday at noon, a tragic fight occurred due to Zhang Jinkui's refusal to allow the scab workers to work, and more than a dozen people were seriously injured. The details are as follows: At about 12 noon yesterday, when the Dada Steamboat Company's Dahe ship arrived at the port, Zhang Jinkui ordered Xie Zhaoming, a foreman from Yangzhou, to lead more than 30 workers to transport goods on the Dahe ship. Suddenly, more than 30 scab workers from Pudong also wanted to join the work. The Puxi workers, because the work at Dada Wharf has always been contracted by them, would not allow others to come and interfere. Therefore, they immediately stopped the work, while the Pudong scab workers, because when Puxi is busy, there are not enough workers, they recruit them to help out. When the work is light, they are arbitrarily dismissed. Therefore, they are determined to have a meal for everyone and still want to transport goods. As a result, the Pudong workers and the Puxi workers first competed for the goods and had a quarrel. Then, they disagreed and started a big fight. They saw the workers on both sides holding weapons such as sticks and iron hooks on the dock, glaring and full of murderous intent, ignoring life and death, and beating each other randomly. As a result, many people were injured on both sides. When the water patrol team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau saw this, they immediately stepped forward and took nine Puxi workers, including Shen Youshan, Cui Tongjiang, Fan Qikang, Zhang Shengtai, Xu Yuguan, Wang Jiuyou, Zhang Dianchen, Zhang Wenxiong, and Xu Erzhong, all from Yangzhou, back to the team for interrogation. They sent 11 injured workers from both sides to the Nanshi Hospital of the Red Cross. There were a total of seven injured people from Pudong, including Xu Baoqing, a 27-year-old from Yangzhou, who was injured in the head, Wang Asong, a 28-year-old from Yangzhou, who was injured in the head, Yang Buchen, a 26-year-old from Huaicheng, who was injured in the head and arms, Wang Heshun, a 21-year-old from Huaicheng, who was injured in the back, Ding Wanlin, a 28-year-old from Huaicheng, who was injured in the head, Yang San, a 45-year-old from Huaicheng, who was injured in the head, and Bao Changxian, a 24-year-old from Yangzhou, who was injured in the head. Among them, Yang Buchen was the most seriously injured and may be in danger of death. There were a total of four people from Puxi who were injured, including Qiu Hengyu, 27 years old, injured in the head, Yan Fengzhen, 29 years old, injured in the head and back, Zhu Xiaozu, 24 years old, injured in the back, and Jiao Guanglong, 27 years old, injured in the back. All of the above are from Yangzhou. Captain Zhu interrogated them and submitted the case to the Judicial Section for review that night.</p>

<p>Police Report for September</p>
<p>Amnesty of Prisoners The Public Works Bureau's police report for September states that in June of this year, the Chinese government promulgated an amnesty decree. According to this decree, the First Special District Court approved the release of 1,427 prisoners from the prisons in the concession from July 16th. Among them, 448 were repeat offenders, 365 had old cases but were not considered repeat offenders, and 614 were first-time offenders. Twelve of those released were foreigners. The crimes committed by the released prisoners ranged from murder, kidnapping, robbery, abduction, and sedition to communist crimes and theft. Some had been convicted up to 19 times. In addition, 80 people who had been released and re-offended were arrested.</p>
<p>Crime Statistics In September, 1,542 reported crimes, an increase of 127 from August (but a decrease of 65 from the same month last year). The increase was due to the release of a large number of prisoners and the cooler weather. However, the number of arrests also increased, totaling 1,752, an increase of 158 from August. In addition, 99 people were arrested for old cases, and 73 were arrested on behalf of officials outside the concession. In September, there were 5 murders, 1 homicide, 1 armed kidnapping, 3 bombing incidents, and 40 armed robberies. This number is 17 more than in August. However, the value of the items stolen was mostly small. In addition, there were 7 robbery cases and 59 theft cases. The police department paid special attention to this because many habitual thieves were released due to the amnesty. There were 28 burglary cases this month. Larceny cases decreased significantly this month, while bicycle theft cases increased. There were 94 snatching cases, nearly double the number of last month, but 78 people were arrested. The reported value of stolen property this month was over 177,000 yuan, and the value of recovered property was over 58,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Communist Party Cases This month, 2,761 pieces of communist propaganda were seized, including 37 types of leaflets, which were newly discovered. The texts mostly concerned the anniversary of the International Youth Movement, the Manchurian problem, and the eradication of communists. Some also denounced White Russians for obstructing strikes. The Communist Party organs searched three places and arrested 12 Chinese, who have not yet been tried.</p>
<p>Strikes There were 5 strikes in the concession this month, involving 1,427 workers and resulting in 484 lost workdays. The factories involved were the Public Bus Company, Neiwaimian Factories 3, 6, and 7, and one tannery and one silk factory.</p>
<p>Film Censorship Police officers inspected 43 feature films and 38 short films. Three feature films and one short film were passed after being censored, and there were no problems with the rest.</p>
<p>Traffic Accidents 968 cases of traffic violations were prosecuted (51 foreigners and 917 Chinese). In addition, more than 3,300 minor cases were given warnings. There were 1,116 traffic accidents this month, with 399 people injured and 10 deaths. Traffic accidents involved bicycles 202 times, and in 73 of these cases, it was proven that the cyclist was at fault.</p>

<p>Report Cites Letter from Mr. Anson Opposing Telephone Price Increase</p>
<p>Organizations such as the Shanghai Citizens' Federation, the Hongkou District Branches, and the business associations of Hanbi Road, Dongyouheng Road, Yuanfang Road, Suzhou Road, North Shaanxi Road, Yinxianggang, Huade Road, East Broadway Road, Haining Road, North Jiangxi Road, East Xihuade Road, Avenue Edward VII, Jielu, Yuezhou Road, Wuzhou Road, Jiaxing Road, Yangshupu Road, etc., held an emergency joint meeting of representatives at 2 pm yesterday to discuss countermeasures against the telephone company's demand that fees be paid according to the new regulations, with a deadline of the 21st, and its threat to disconnect the lines. More than 20 people, including Zhang Yumen, attended, and Zhang Xianfang was elected chairman. After the report was made, the following matters were discussed: (1) The telephone price increase case. It was resolved that: (A) A declaration should be issued; (B) Another letter should be sent to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to lodge a serious protest and stop the disconnection. The declaration and the letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association are recorded below.</p>
<p>Declaration Opposing Telephone Price Increase Shanghai is China's first commercial port. In recent years, commerce has been exhausted, and coupled with the war, the market has become even more desolate, finance has declined, and the people are struggling to survive. Instead of seeking material reductions to help each other through difficult times, so as to save this declining situation, all public utilities, which are in a position of coexistence and co-prosperity, should exercise the method of mediation. Telephones are one of the public utilities. How can the company unilaterally raise prices and the Public Works Bureau ignore public opinion, follow their lead, and arbitrarily raise prices? They did not publicize it in advance, nor did they seek the consent of the Chinese taxpayers, violating legal principles and human feelings, and opening an unprecedented example of price increases, which is infuriating. The company cited Mr. Anson's proposal in 1929. Now Mr. Anson has sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau, saying that "the original intention was to test whether the company could keep its promise" and that "the pre-testing was only a trial." How can the Public Works Bureau seriously regard it as a passed case? Moreover, the market today is not what it used to be, and Mr. Anson also said, "[However, the economic changes during this period mentioned above have not been taken into account]," etc. We should know that Shanghai's current economic situation is declining, so how can we increase the burden on the citizens? This time, the opposition to the telephone price increase is based on public justice. The Zilin News reported the other day that Americans also oppose the price increase. Therefore, the opposition to the telephone price increase has become a consensus among Chinese and Western people. According to the report, there is even a record of the Public Works Bureau guaranteeing a one-point interest rate, which is even more shocking. Now, in the core calculation of the price increase, they say that it only accounts for 8%. We are afraid that after this year, it will have to be increased again next year. If the price is increased again and again, how can the citizens bear it? Looking to the future, for the sake of the future, we must insist on opposing it to the end. Let us encourage each other. This is our declaration.</p>
<p>Letter of Protest Against Disconnection to the Taxpayers' Association (abridged above) We have repeatedly struggled against the telephone price increase. Under this protest, the company even threatened to collect the increased fees and gave a deadline of the 21st of this month to disconnect the lines, etc. This illegal method has made the Chinese taxpayers' association very angry. The company is using the Public Works Bureau's approval as an iron case and is obviously using one-sided words. The Public Works Bureau is exercising dictatorship, which our Chinese taxpayers can hardly tolerate. Now, let us list its illegal points: (1) Arbitrarily raising prices without publicizing the facts in advance; (2) All price increases are timely, so how can the past period be increased at the time of billing and included; (3) Using the Public Works Bureau as a kissing permit, the price increase was not subject to the public opinion of all Chinese taxpayers; (4) Compulsory execution is not allowed by law. We are very legally paying the same fees as before under protest. How can we collect the price increase and disconnect the lines at will? If we owe money, we must also pursue it through legal procedures and implement coercive illegal methods; (5) According to Mr. Anson's proposal in 1929, three years have passed. At this time of commercial decline and economic exhaustion, it is too much to suddenly increase its price without considering the situation. Based on the above facts and the opposition to the price increase, the just demands that our Chinese taxpayers should have are that, before the protest period is resolved, paying the same price is the only proper way. We firmly oppose the company's illegal act of limiting the disconnection. We will send another letter to your association to fight to the end based on reason and strive to achieve the final goal, and we must strictly stop the disconnection to comfort public opinion.</p>

<p>Huang Chengxie's Attempted Fraud</p>
<p>Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Huang Chengxie, a clerk of the First Special District Court, was suspected of attempting to defraud Zhang Deqing, the manager of the former China Hotel. Wang Zhennan, the chief prosecutor of the Second Branch of the High Court, found out about this and sent Huang to the prosecutor's office of the Special Court to be taken into custody. In addition, opium paraphernalia was found in Huang's home. Prosecutor Zhang Xiaoguang opened an investigation court and concluded the investigation. The police also filed a public prosecution for Huang's possession of opium paraphernalia. He was sentenced to four months of imprisonment and a fine of 60 yuan for opium use. It has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that Huang Chengxie's fraud has also been prosecuted by the prosecutor's office. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the Fifth Criminal Court for interrogation. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer specially assigned by the Public Works Bureau, attended the hearing. After the witness Zhang Deqing testified, his testimony was the same as that provided in the previous investigation court. After the prosecutor's argument, the defendant's lawyer began to debate for a long time. Judge Liu sentenced the defendant Huang Ji'an, i.e., Huang Chengxie, in court for the crime of attempting to induce others to deliver property by fraudulent means, to six months of imprisonment. Before the judgment is determined, the number of days of detention shall be offset by two days for one day of imprisonment. Upon hearing the verdict, the defendant stated in court that he was dissatisfied and prepared to appeal.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Taoyuanfang Robbery Case <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Two Injured Western Detectives in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Injured Robber Healed and Interrogated Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>At 8:30 am on the 14th of this month, the home of Wang Shaofu, a Ningbo native, at No. 123 Taoyuanfang, North Jiangxi Road, was robbed. The Hongkou Police Department's Chinese Detective Shen Chongli, Zhang Guisheng, Bai Mingfu, and two Western detectives rushed to arrest the gang. They opened fire and resisted arrest, resulting in the deaths of two robbers, Ma Zhengxiang and surnamed Mu, and the injury of two robbers, Jiang Huixing and Zhu Youlong, who were sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. Subsequently, 12 accomplices, including Zheng Guangzong, Wang Acai, Zhang A'er, and Kong Rongsheng, were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The injured robber Zhu Youlong had recovered from his hip injury the day before yesterday and was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court for interrogation yesterday morning. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police department, stated that two Western detectives from the police department were injured, one in the right arm and one in the leg. The one who was injured in the right arm had his arm amputated due to the severity of the injury, and it is still difficult to predict whether he will survive. The bullet has not yet been removed from the one who was injured in the leg, which is very dangerous. At that time, the police department seized a Mauser pistol, an automatic pistol, and a small Browning pistol, as well as 240 yuan in banknotes. A diamond ring was also found on the defendant. Jiang Huixing confessed that he knew Ma Zhengxiang and was introduced by Ma to Wang Acai and others to discuss the matter. The firearms were borrowed by Ma from Kong Rongsheng. When the robbery took place, I went to knock on the door and pretended to be a mahjong company. Someone was talking to Mr. Wang (i.e., the victim). When the detectives arrived, I was going to open fire and resist arrest, but the bullet jammed, which led to my arrest. Judge Fu verified the confession and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further interrogation at a later date.</p>

<p>At about 7 pm last night, a private sedan car with Public Concession license plate No. 5702 and Municipal Public Works Bureau license plate No. 5976 was found parked at the intersection of Datong Road and Yongxing Road in Zhabei. It had been parked there for more than two hours, but no one was seen in the car, and there was no driver. A police officer at post No. 41 in the Fourth District noticed this and immediately reported it to the branch office. The branch office sent police to bring the car back to the office and reported it to the headquarters to investigate the owner and the case.</p>

<p>None of the Four Injured Survive</p>
<p>Liang Zilun Also Dies from Serious Injuries</p>
<p>Liang Xiuzhen and Li Huiqing, dancers at the Anle Palace at No. 263 Changyuanli, Haining Road, were broken into by thugs at about 1 am on the 19th of this month. Liang's mother, Ms. Li, her son Zilun, her younger sister Qiaolan, and Li's adopted son Tong Liguang were injured with sharp blades. At the time, all of them were seriously injured, and three of them have since died. Liang Zilun was still being treated at the Tongren Hospital. It has been reported in the past two days. Unexpectedly, Zilun also died from serious injuries at 2:30 pm the day before yesterday. None of the four people who were hacked survived, which is tragic. Zilun's body was still ordered by the Hongkou Police Department to be taken to the Filun Road mortuary for examination. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Zhang Yaoguang, forensic doctor Wei Ligong, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others to come to the mortuary to examine the case. After Liang Xiuzhen described the circumstances of the incident, Zhang Yu ordered the examination to determine that the deceased boy Liang Zilun was killed by someone before his death. The body was handed over to his sister Liang Xiuzhen to take back for burial. According to forensic doctor Wei, according to today's examination of the wounds of the deceased, it seems that two kinds of weapons were used to hack him, because some bones were broken. It is inferred that the weapon may be an ax, because if a smaller knife is used, it will not be like this.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Wang Liansheng's Case of Forcible Defilement of a Young Girl <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Has Been Certified by a Doctor</p>
<p>Wang Still Strongly Argues and Denies</p>
<p>Wang Liansheng, a 48-year-old Anhui native who lives in a flat in Jingzhou Road and runs a grocery store, is obsessed with lust. At about 4 pm on the 13th of this month, he dragged Chen Alan, a 15-year-old girl from Taizhou, into the bedroom and defiled her. After the incident, Yangshupu Police Department Chinese Detective Shen Yuzhou arrested Wang and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. It has been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin came to the Third Criminal Court for further interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police department, stated that during the postponement, he inquired about the Guangren Hospital doctor's previous examination report, which determined that the victim Chen Alan's hymen was newly ruptured. It is said that within 24 hours is the explanation of recently. At that time, after the defendant had intercourse with the girl, a piece of black cloth was seized. After the doctor used medicine to test it, there was only semen and no blood. It is also brought to the court today. It was also investigated that when the defendant dragged Alan into his bedroom at the time, he closed the door. Many children saw it and knew that there was something improper. They went to the back door and peeked through a small glass window to see them engaging in illicit sexual acts. They shouted loudly outside. However, the group of children are all young and cannot be called to testify. The defendant previously claimed at the police station that an old woman surnamed Xiao saw that there was no adulterous affair. The police have inquired about it and said that she went to buy firewood at the time and returned in a short time. She did not know about the defilement of the girl. Based on the reasons, it is certain that the defendant had defiled the girl. Subsequently, the girl Chen Alan insisted that she was dragged into the room and had intercourse, and her lower body was painful, but there was no blood. Lawyer Zhang from the police department also stated that according to the doctor, a small number of girls have no blood when the hymen is broken. Please pay attention to the court. Interrogate the defendant's confession. On this day, I went to Fei, a cobbler near the stall, to collect rice money. The girl happened to come to repair her shoes. Fei joked with me, saying that the girl would spend three yuan to buy clothes and pants and could sleep with her. I said don't joke. The girl heard this and smiled at me and left. Not long after, the girl hurried over and ran into my bedroom. I dragged her out. At that time, an old woman surnamed Xiao saw it. In an instant, a vagrant surnamed Wang came to blackmail me for 30 yuan and wanted to kill me with an axe. I was not afraid and ignored him. The vagrant then instigated Chen to accuse me of rape. According to Fei Changhe, a cobbler, the defendant did ask me for money at the time, and Chen brought her shoes to repair, but she left because she thought the price was too high. I did not say anything about sleeping for three yuan. Judge Fu verified the confession and ordered him to be remanded in custody for further interrogation after calling witnesses.</p>

<p>A Mediator Assaulted</p>
<p>Sun Shengchang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 13 Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession, sublet surplus rooms as a second landlord to a woman named Feng Zhu. Zhu had a maid who often stole Sun's food. Annoyed, Sun terminated her lease recently, ordering her to move. As Zhu was pregnant and nearing her delivery, she was concerned about the impact of a sudden move on her health and pleaded with Sun for a ten-day extension. However, Sun, known for his impetuousness, refused. An argument ensued, and the lane's administrator, a man named Wu, called the police, who took both parties to the police station. Following mediation, Zhu was ordered to move by a set deadline. Unexpectedly, after leaving the station and returning home, Sun resorted to violence, throwing Zhu's belongings outside, demanding her immediate departure. Another quarrel broke out. Lou Liansheng, residing at No. 5 in the same lane, along with other neighbors, watched as Zhu, heavily pregnant, jumped and screamed, fearing for her fetus. Lou stepped forward to mediate, but Sun mistakenly turned his anger on Lou, dragging him to the police station, accusing him of assault and inflicting head injuries. The police chief ordered Sun to be treated at Renji Hospital. Meanwhile, Lou was sent to the Second Special Court, charged under Article 293 of the criminal code for assault. Lou was ordered to post bail for a later hearing. The previous day, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the continued hearing at the Second Criminal Court. Plaintiff Sun Shengchang recounted the assault, gesticulating wildly as if suffering from a nervous disorder. Defendant Lou Liansheng denied the assault.</p>
<p>Attorney Li Pengcheng was retained for defense, and neighbor Tang Anzhen was called as a witness. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Zhang acquitted and released Lou Liansheng.</p>

<p>Qian Zubei's Trial Suspended</p>
<p>Qian Zubei, known as the "Red Pill King," alias Guo Lian, nicknamed "Little Shandong," previously established a large-scale illegal red pill operation at No. 46 Ruifu Lane, Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, selling over ten thousand taels worth of pills monthly.

Sixty-five small packs, twenty-five medium packs, and one large pack of red pills, as well as silver coins, were confiscated. Smoking paraphernalia was also found at Yu Jinkang's residence. All were sent to the Second Special Court. After questioning, Qian was ordered to post a bail of eight thousand yuan, Chen Degen three thousand yuan, and the other four one thousand yuan each, pending further investigation. Qian disappeared after posting bail. The court issued a second summons and declared the debate concluded, setting a date for the verdict. Details of Qian Zubei's bail forfeiture and arrest warrant were previously reported. Yesterday, Judge Xiong presided over the verdict at the First Criminal Court, sentencing Shi Yinbao to one year of imprisonment and a fine of five hundred yuan for selling opium substitutes; Chen Degen, alias Chen Degen, to six months of imprisonment and a fine of fifty yuan for aiding in the sale of opium substitutes; Yu Jinkang to eight months of imprisonment and a fine of one hundred yuan for providing premises for opium substitute smoking with intent to profit.

<p>Careless Cooking with Kerosene Stove</p>
<p>At 9:30 last night, a fire broke out at No. 577 Xibaoxing Road, Zhabei, when Pu Wu, a tenant on the upper floor, carelessly left a kerosene stove burning while cooking rice. She went downstairs to attend to other matters, neglecting the stove, which ignited a mosquito net near the table. By the time she noticed, the room was filled with smoke, and soon flames burst through the roof, spreading to the floor below and affecting the adjacent No. 575, a barber shop. Fire trucks were dispatched to the scene and extinguished the fire shortly after arrival. The Fifth District Office also sent personnel to investigate the cause of the fire, and tenant Pu Wu was taken into custody, pending questioning of her husband before further action.</p>

<p>The Power of the "Invincible Brand" Chemical Fire Extinguisher</p>
<p>A fire broke out at Gu Longxing's store on Tingsi Road, west of the Southern City Local Court, at 7:00 AM on the 20th, originating from a cotton pile in the back building. The fire spread to the roof, with flames leaping and sparks flying. Fortunately, the adjacent Family Industrial Society quickly used an "Invincible Brand" chemical fire extinguisher to combat the flames. The device proved extremely convenient: when inverted, the chemical foam sprayed out through the hose, extinguishing the fire instantly. The store was located in a remote area, and the fire brigade had not yet noticed the blaze. Without the rapid action of the "Invincible Brand" chemical fire extinguisher, not only would the store have been lost, but several neighboring businesses would have been consumed as well.</p>

The committee's bidding guidelines are excerpted below: (1) Bidders must first pay a sample fee of 10 yuan at the committee to obtain sample materials, draft samples, and contract drafts for detailed review in preparation for bidding. (2) All sample materials, draft samples, and contract drafts obtained by bidders must be returned, regardless of whether they vote or not. The committee will rely on this to recover the sample fee paid. (3) After a bidder has paid the sample fee to the committee, those who wish to bid must be verified by the committee to ensure that they have the ability to undertake the work before obtaining a bid envelope and bid form. At the same time, a bid deposit of 1,000 yuan must be paid, and the meeting will issue a receipt.

(8) The winning bidder shall, within seven days of the announcement, produce a sample according to the specified materials and draft sample, and send it to the meeting for approval, and at the same time pay 10% of the bid price as a contract deposit.

Among them, such as Mr. Wen Yu's [A Brief History of the National Goods Movement], records in detail the circumstances of the government and the people's promotion of the National Goods Movement from the first year of the Republic of China to the twentieth year of the Republic of China, a period of twenty years, which is classified and described in great detail. The reasons why it is not easy for domestic goods to develop are also pointed out in detail. At this critical moment of survival, those who seek to boycott Japanese goods and manufacture domestic goods should urgently read this article. Mr. Xu Jingxian's [A Brief History of Chinese Catholicism] describes in detail the origin, faction, missionary affairs, and the region of missionary work of Chinese Catholicism. [Notes from the Ancient Red Plum Pavilion] by Jiangdong Adu, which is published in this issue, is an excerpt of Yuan Shikai's handling of Beiyang affairs, which is of great interest. Mr. Liao Shigong's [The Relationship between Ancient China and the World], this issue continues [Mr. Qian Luxiang's Notes], which is even more valuable in terms of literature and art. [Reading Notes] by Wen Yu introduces [Shanghai Workers' Living Expenses Index], and the index of important magazines and excerpts attached to it is particularly rich in selection.

<p>The Volcano Drama Society was originally organized by revolutionary youth Mr. Chen Xingmin in conjunction with writers and playwrights. However, due to a bad environment, it became a flash in the pan. People who knew about it regretted it. Recently, all the students of the Renwen Middle School were driven by their love of drama, and they restored this aborted Volcano Drama Society and hired Zhu Yingpeng and Chen Dabei as consultants, and Yao Sufeng, Xu Gongmei, Jin Guangmei, Shao Piaoyao, Xu Zexiang, He Jia, Tang Zengzeng, Jiang Zhanying, Lou Jinsheng, Chen Xingmin, etc. as instructors. They are now actively carrying out rehearsals of plays such as Night Curtain and Chen Yuan. A large-scale public performance is planned for mid-November. This is good news in the twilight of the drama movement.</p>

<p>Cheng Zhuchen and Du Chunsun initiated a plan to print 1 million copies of the Shanghai National Disaster Map, which was published by the Xingmin Art Society, and sell each copy for 20 cents.

Recently, it was learned that the Shuanglong Tea Shop on Nanjing Road has decided to propose 10% of the goods sold within a week, starting next week, as a relief fund for the disaster areas of the three provinces. The store is enthusiastic about helping relief, which is commendable, and it is also heard that the store and other stores are eager to follow up.</p>

<p>After the closure of the Hongkou Hotel, a labor dispute occurred, and the labor party had already presented a request to the party and government agencies for relief. However, the capital party's attitude was tough, resulting in unsuccessful negotiations. After more than a month, it has not been resolved. More than 100 waiters and others gathered more than 100 workers yesterday and went to the Party Department to petition. Lu Yinchu of the Civilian Training Section received them, promising to deal with it as soon as possible and dissuading the workers from taking any action outside the orbit and waiting for a solution.</p>

<p>To the Editor, In the local news column of your newspaper on the 21st of this month, I read the news item "Forced Divorce, Wife Desperate and Commits Suicide." After reading it, it is slightly inconsistent with the facts. It was the deceased's mother, Mrs. Ye Fan, who came forward to negotiate with Yu Zengrong and filed a criminal lawsuit with the court. Because the deceased's mother was sick in bed, she entrusted me to take care of her, so I made a commitment to the prosecutor to coffin and bury her. The report said (had negotiated with Sister Qian) etc., which must be false rumors. I am sending a special letter to inform you and hope that it will be corrected immediately.

<h3 id="e191">Taking a Circuitous Route <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Taking the direct path was the norm during the Three Dynasties, a golden age long past. In the modern era, however, taking a circuitous route is advocated everywhere. In social engagements, commercial advertising, the major policies of important figures, and various other approaches, no one is willing to do as the people of Suzhou say: dragging logs through a narrow alleyway, straight out. Instead, they must imitate the curvilinear beauty of women, believing that the more circuitous, the more rounded, the more beautiful. In this way, what is said will not fall on deaf ears, like a neverending circle. Alas! Words that do not fall on deaf ears are equivalent to useless words!</p>
<p>Everything can be circuitous: suppose you ask someone for guidance on success or failure, or to judge merits and demerits, it seems that there should be a definite indication; but, according to two anecdotes I have heard, those who give guidance and those who judge can also use a circuitous method to deal with it.</p>
<p>In the old days of the imperial examinations, there were three candidates who asked a certain high monk to predict their success or failure: the high monk did not add any opinion, but only raised one finger. After the candidates left, someone asked the high monk: Can this one finger indicate their success or failure? The monk said: This is a circuitous indication, no matter what, they cannot escape the old monk's one-finger Zen: if all three pass the exam, it means that everything is successful; if all three fail, it means that everything is unsuccessful; if two of the three pass and one fails, it means that one is unsuccessful, and if one of the three passes and two fail, it means that one is successful: no one can escape this all-around one-finger Zen opportunity.</p>
<p>There was also a young woman who sat at a square table with three suitors at the same time; the three men asked the young woman at the same time: Who of us three is better? The young woman came up with a circuitous answer: facing the suitors sitting opposite her, she said: You are good. The tip of her high-heeled leather shoes quietly kicked the feet of the suitors on the left and right under the table, so that all three suitors sitting together felt that the young woman praised them.</p>
<p>Alas! There are no people who take the direct path now; the impartial people and judges of the modern era are expressing the one-finger Zen opportunity there; they are promising the other party with their mouths, and secretly kicking the feet of both parties with their toes.</p>
<h3 id="e192">A Brave General of the 19th Route Army <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Yangshan</p>
<p>| General Weng Zhaoyuan |</p>
<p>General Weng Zhaoyuan, loyal and brave in resisting Japan, fighting for national dignity and for the glory of the nation, has long been admired by people at home. He is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy. After graduation, he went to France to study aviation. Once, during a test flight in Paris, the plane was inverted and about to crash. The audience on the ground thought that there was no hope of survival. If others were in this dangerous situation, they would definitely fall from a high altitude and die, but the general always tried his best to support it, and was finally able to drive the plane to the ground, only injuring his foot.</p>
<p>He used to be a division commander, and then he went to be a soldier for a year. This spirit is really admirable. Now he doesn't have a wife and lives in a house with a monthly rent of more than ten yuan.</p>
<p>When the Shanghai Incident broke out, the general was in charge of the front line, fighting against the Japanese soldiers in Zhabei. The enemy could not enter a step. Later, because Wusong was in urgent need, the general was transferred to defend the area. At that time, the enemy used all its naval, land and air forces to attack Wusong. The general commanded freely and held the fort, using machine guns as artillery to kill the enemy. He said to his subordinates: [We kill the enemy with guns, no guns with bayonets, no bayonets with gun butts, no gun butts with hands and feet.] What tragic words these are. After the 19th Route Army had withdrawn, the general still held the fort and refused to leave. The elders of Wusong told him in tears, persuading him to save his body to serve the country in the future. At this point, he cried bitterly and withdrew his troops, and was still in a battle with the Japanese soldiers for three rounds at China Public School.</p>
<p>This time, General Weng resigned from his position as brigade commander and went abroad to promote aviation and save the country. When he arrived in Shanghai, it was the first day of the school's voluntary military training this semester. He was invited to the school to give a speech, which was full of heroism and filled his eyebrows. In his speech, he said: [Don't be pessimistic about the future of China. We must know that national disasters are not very terrible. The most terrible thing is that everyone does not know how to save it when there is a national disaster! ]</p>
<h3 id="e193">Are You Pursuing Too, Friend? <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Xiang</p>
<p>丨For Modern Men丨</p>
<p>Friend, are you married? Do you also feel sexual frustration? Are you pursuing someone? Are you pursuing blindly! Or do you already have a worthy counterpart, and does she also love you? Is your face handsome? Is your suit elegant? Do you have money in your pocket? Does she find these things satisfying? Otherwise, if you don't have even these basic requirements for romance, then I advise you to be quiet! Your pursuit will only lead to disappointment, and you will never gain any sympathy from the other party; no, sometimes you won't even get a reaction because here, it's entirely a sphere of influence of gold, and with your poor appearance, you can't even dream of stepping in! This is the truth, I'm not lying to you.</p>
<p>[However, don't be discouraged, and don't be sad. As long as you can seize the gold, you can satisfy everything. The problem of a single woman is really small! There are so many women in the world, beautiful women are snatched away by rich people one by one, and if they're sad, they will be replenished batch after batch to adapt to the needs of this era. Therefore, at this moment, don't pursue women, you should pursue gold first. Once the money in your pocket is full, then, regardless of whether your beard is already long, there will naturally be peerless young beauties to serve you with gentleness and consideration. Don't say one, you can have ten or eight, as long as you are happy, you won't have to worry about scarcity. Even if she is a first-class celebrity, as long as you have money, you can always buy her!</p>
<p>[Friend, are you pursuing too? Do you also feel sexual frustration? If you ask yourself if you have all the requirements for romance, and you don't, then I am willing to give you a piece of advice: let's first think of a way to make money!]</p>

<p>— Ci Min</p>
<p>丨What I Saw After the Calamity丨</p>
<p>A light breeze brushes by, the seawater ripples slightly, on a grassy ground, several cloth tents are pitched, a gramophone releases melodious and soft tunes, intoxicating pairs of modern men and women dozing side by side, pear skins, chestnut shells, and empty bottles of whiskey and soda water are strewn all around them like mud figures who have drunk themselves senseless!</p>
<p>The two cannons that were blasted to pieces by enemy warships during the Shanghai battle still lie in the withered yellow autumn grass, unattended. But the spiral nails all over their bodies have long been stolen and sold by people. When I went up to take a closer look, the words "[Made by the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau in the 27th year of Guangxu]" clearly leapt into my eyes. Ah! Blue-eyed devils, Japanese, often pass by here, I wonder what they think when they see it?</p>
<p>Several yellow oxen, with their heads lowered, wag their tails as they graze contentedly, they seem to have forgotten the rope that people have tied in their nostrils! Farmers hold scythes, diligently and steadily, some are harvesting sorghum, some are cutting down rice stalks, they simply don't think about how deep the sea is in front of them, or how high the sky is above them. Swallows, reluctant to leave their homeland, soar over the clear and pure sea, not heading south.</p>
<p>Our country's sailing ships, British merchant ships, and Japanese warships, in the setting sun of dusk, are heading towards their respective destinations!</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Hair of Female Workers in Silk and紗 Factories <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Pu Wuxiu</p>
<p>It is Inappropriate to Cut it Off; All Should Wear Buns</p>
<p>Women wearing their hair long has been a long-standing custom, and elegance arises from cloud-like hair and misty temples. Indeed, women cherish their hair as if it were their second life. However, as times change and the world shifts, the trend of cutting hair has become popular. Young ladies from humble families and daughters from wealthy households, seeking beautification, all find it quick to cut their hair. Occasionally, due to the prohibition of fathers and brothers, or the disapproval of husbands, some still have to wear a long braid or a low bun, but these are only a minority. Female workers in纱 and silk factories, with long, dangling black braids, get their braids caught in the belts due to the wind, and as a result, dozens lose their lives every year. For example, A-mei, a female worker from Changzhou in the fine yarn section of the Yong'an纱 Factory in Wusong Yuncaobang, as reported in the Ten-Day News, is one such case. The report stated that A-mei, while working on the morning of the ninth, inadvertently had her braid caught in the belt, and in an instant, the long braid was pulled away with the scalp, causing injury and leaving her life in danger. Seeing this, it seems that female workers should cut their hair to ensure safety.</p>
<p>However, in all things under heaven, there are benefits and drawbacks. The local silk factories previously received a cable from European manufacturers, stating that while Chinese silk is of excellent quality, it is occasionally mixed with short hair. If artificial methods are used to remove it, it would be extremely laborious. If scientific methods are used to eliminate it, it is feared that it would damage the silk warp. The best way to handle this matter is to inform the female workers not to cut their hair while working. In fact, when the motor is turned on and the belt is rotating, the wind force is quite strong, and the short hair of female workers who have cut their hair often blows down and mixes into the silk, making it difficult to sell abroad.</p>
<p>In my opinion, if female workers can avoid wearing braids and cutting their hair, and all wear buns, then even if hair falls out from the roots, due to being tied tightly, it won't fall down unless untied and re-tied. In this way, both parties can be taken care of and both can benefit. It is safe during work, and the product is clean and unmixed. It will be seen that it will become popular globally and sell well everywhere, then inferior Japanese goods will naturally have no place to be used. I hope that those in charge of each factory will not neglect it because it is minor. (Moved to donate to the Northeast Volunteer Army)</p>

<p>— Seeking Happiness Studio Owner</p>
<p>It turned out that佟一貞's uncle, 佟貴福, was originally a member of the Eight Banners, and his mind was so old and rotten that he always blamed the Manchu people for losing the country and the absence of the True Dragon Emperor for his own poor situation, which prevented him from enjoying the imperial favor again. Now, hearing that 宣統 had ascended the throne in Changchun and restored the Manchukuo, he thought that he had another good opportunity to serve the dragon, and it would not be difficult to rise to prominence and still be among the ranks of the nobles. However, he did not know that 溥儀 was just a leader of prisoners, a puppet manipulated by the Japanese. Where in the world was there a real Manchukuo? He was just having such a dream in vain, and he still had to be loyal and look down on 魯伯勤. He was really a big fool in the world.</p>
<p>魯伯勤 was young and vigorous, and he wanted to argue with 佟貴福, who was so deranged and stubborn, or at least give him some warnings. But considering 佟一貞's sake, he didn't want to harm the thing he valued because of the rat nearby, and he couldn't let him lose his temper at will; and 佟一貞 was also painstakingly mediating in secret, repeatedly advising him not to take this stubborn man's words seriously, it was best to ignore him, and he had to reluctantly learn to pretend to be deaf and dumb and laugh it off. It's just that they didn't see eye to eye, so from then on, he became too lazy to go to 佟's house, preferring to still meet 佟一貞 in the open air, and no longer look at 佟貴福's strange face that was tasteless in speech and hateful in appearance.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, unpleasant things came one after another. The post office, where 魯伯勒 had entrusted his life, also gradually had many unfortunate entanglements, and there was a danger of shaking and collapsing. As his cousin had predicted before, the Japanese methods were extremely vicious, and they had to completely erode all the rights and interests of the Northeast. They would never allow the only remaining post office of the Republic of China to continue to exercise its powers safely. At this time, unfortunately, the prediction came true.</p>
<p>The process of this change was as follows: at first, the Japanese used the excuse of inspecting books, newspapers, and letters sent from various places within the pass, and sent some inspectors to the post office to randomly tear open the mail, flailing their hands and feet, and rushing around. The arrogance was really great. They also suspected that the post office staff secretly released the Tianjin-Hankou newspapers, preventing them from detaining them, and often became angry and said they wanted to execute people, and they had already quarreled with the post office staff. Recently, using Manchukuo as a cover, they actually wanted to transfer the entire postal service of the three northeastern provinces to Manchukuo, and limited the postmaster to set a date for the handover. They also threatened the general postal staff in every way, requiring them to continue to serve Manchukuo faithfully, otherwise they would send a military police team to arrest them. Although the postmaster was fortunately a European and American, he still dared to find foreign consuls to argue with them, but when they argued to the point of exhaustion, they still could not match the barbaric force. It was clear that this only surviving post office of the Republic of China could not be protected! Relying on the postmaster's protection, the staff may still be able to obtain a passport to leave the country, but can they really be sent away so cheaply? In the end, no one dared to guarantee it.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Financial and Gold Prices Soar Enthusiastically <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Increased by Eight Taels and Three Qian. Yesterday, the bidding price for gold increased even more fiercely, shaking off its long dormant state and appearing enthusiastic. However, the difference was not too excessive, with the high and low points of the day being about eight taels apart. In the end, it frequently increased by more than eight taels. There were many transactions on the surface, but they followed different routes. It rose slightly in the early morning, and the silver market was quite stable. Futures were reported to be falling, and the price of American cotton was also slightly affected. Then, it stabilized. Afterwards, the Guangdong merchants, such as Hengxing and Yifeng, actively covered their short positions, which were being advanced by Zhifeng, Yongheng, and others, causing the market situation to move forward bravely and soar, breaking through the 740 tael mark. However, the foreign exchange market was slightly tight. Although Guangdong merchants and others were covering their previous short positions, the banks were willing to sell, and the exchange rate rose, so the US dollar did not see excessive strength. In the later market, Hengxing and Yifeng continued to buy aggressively, but selling positions were also active. As the exchange rate stabilized, the banks sold steadily, and the gold price moved in the opposite direction, eventually returning to the 40 tael mark. Furthermore, with the buying side becoming more vigorous, a new peak of over 743 taels suddenly appeared. Finally, it stabilized. The Central Bank absorbed more than 500 ingots of spot gold in the front and back markets, with prices ranging from 37 taels to 41 taels and a few qian, which were sold by Dadecheng, Runchang, and others. Also, in November, Dadecheng transferred 210 ingots to Tongtaichang in the morning, with a discount of 5 taels and 7 qian 5. However, many firms did not sell all their gold. The detailed situation of the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>Gradual Progress Seen in the Morning. The opening price for December immediately rose by 2 taels and 1 qian, reaching 736 taels and 3 qian. The prices for large ingots and silver did not change. Private telegrams reported an increase of one-eighth, so it opened high. Then, it returned to 5 taels and 3 qian, before gradually increasing to 6 taels and 9 qian. Bingxing and others bought, while Zhaofengchang and others sold. Also, as the exchange rate was still stable, the forward rate was first quoted at 1.95 to 4.375, and the US dollar for December was 3.125. At around 9:30, it was 5 taels and 4 qian. The HSBC posted prices, with each of the British and American rates shrinking by 0.125, and the gold price only increasing by 4 or 5 qian. Hengxing sold more than 100 ingots on behalf of its customers, while Bing, Heng, Yu, and others also sold. Also, the December US dollar was traded at 3.75, and then it was 5 taels and 2 qian. The trend was quite stable, with only a slight increase of over 1 tael. The Central Bank opened and bought 210 ingots. Dadecheng, Yifeng, Yongzhaofengchang, and others made slight progress in spot trading. However, from 9:30 to 10:30, it stood at over 36 taels. In a short time, Hong, Yongyifengyongzhaofengchangfuchangxiexingyongfutaihengyuantai and others entered the market to buy, and Zhifengyonghengyu bravely covered their short positions on behalf of Hengxingyi, and so the price went up. After 11 o'clock, it broke through the 40 tael mark and made progress all the way. As the exchange market improved slightly, Hengxingshengdayifeng and other firms rushed to cover their positions. Unexpectedly, the banks' selling momentum was strong, so it was not very tight. Until 11:30, it was 42 taels and 6 qian. However, the selling side was not weak, with fluctuations of 1 tael or so. Afterwards, Yifengyongyuanmaoyuyuhe as well as scattered bulls took the opportunity to sell off, causing the price to fall sharply by more than 1 tael, to 41 taels and 1 qian. By the time of the noon close, it was 42 taels and 2 qian. The near-term forward rate was 0.125, and the US dollar at 30 yuan could be settled.</p>
<p>New Peak Seen in the Afternoon. The opening price in the afternoon market was 42 taels and 1 qian, followed by 2 taels and 7 qian. However, as Hengyu, Zhifeng, Yongfuchang, Yifengyong, and others were selling, Hengxingyifeng and others were not moved by their purchases. In addition, the exchange rate did not increase, and HSBC, Mai Bank, Citibank, and Huabi continued to sell without hesitation. The December US dollar was quoted at 0.125, and the January forward rate was 1.87 to 2.25. Therefore, the gold price fell by more than 1 tael, with 2.15 at 2:15. As the Central Bank absorbed 220 ingots of spot gold, Dadecheng covered its position. Hengxing continued to progress, and Hengyu again progressed on behalf of Yifeng, immediately rising by 1 tael, with 2.20 at over 42 taels. Huabi issued a slightly softer December US dollar rate, quoted at 0.0625. Then, November was quoted at 0.0625 to 0.125. Huaronghuabi issued December at 1.875, and January forward at 3.125.

<p>Shanghai South Yesterday, more than a dozen dealers from various groups were sluggish in sales. The sales of Changshu and Xinjing rice varied.

<p>News There were still many goods coming from Luliu. Transactions of Kunshan, Jiangyin, and Liyang goods were extremely sluggish, and prices dropped by 0.3-0.4 yuan. There were slightly more Changshu goods on the North wharves.</p>
<p>Short Sales Approaching a Foot The declining trend of kiln rice from Shi, Jiao, Si, and Jiashan stabilized, falling by about 0.3 yuan. The supply of imported ocean rice was limited, and prices were stable.</p>

<p>| Tianjin Merchants Bought 3,500 Bags |</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market conditions were average in this area, but sales to the North became more active. Tianjin merchants bought 3,000 bags of Mindang rice and 500 bags of Xiaojiao rice. The market immediately improved, but prices were still difficult to increase due to sufficient inventory and the listing of new early rice from various regions. However, if the North has another large batch of sales in the future, market prices may recover. Recently, the North has had a demand and often inquired about prices in the market, but they were reluctant to buy immediately because the prices were too high. As new rice from various regions gradually arrived, they mainly adhered to their prices and inquired again after a slight decrease. Since prices had reached rock bottom, they had no choice but to buy at market prices. Merchants in this area bought 300 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice and 300 bags of Xiaojiao rice. The price of Mindang was 8.3 yuan, which was 0.7-0.8 yuan lower than the selling price at the beginning of the month. Xiaojiao was 7.65-7.6 yuan, and No. 1 Saigon was 9.09-9.06 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, the market for each month fluctuated by about 0.1 yuan, based on the quoted price of foreign wheat. Therefore, after opening, people's minds were calm and there was not much difference from the previous day. Although the factory's sales continued to come out, they have decreased compared to the previous day, and the spot sales of foreign wheat have also stopped temporarily, so outsiders are also slightly relieved. The far-term is about 0.25% better. Until the afternoon opening, the far-term generally hovered. The factory has no large number of orders, and both sides are closing transactions. The market is stable, but the situation in this month suddenly saw setbacks, because the customers have sufficient inventory, and some have returned to the market. A certain factory is unwilling to hold, resulting in a very crazy decline. As a result, the fall this month was 1.75% lower than the previous day, November fell 1%, December was unchanged, January and February were 0.5% better, and March was 0.25% better.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Wheat Futures Morning Fall Afternoon Back to Flat <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after opening in the morning, the market for each month showed a sudden sharp drop. The factories had already set a certain percentage of the previous day's foreign wheat, and the price was also cheap, fearing that there would be a continuous trend of setting prices in the future. Most people, at this point, became more and more false and soft. After opening the price, it invisibly dropped, about 0.6, 0.7, or 0.8 points. This stable situation was completely affected by the previous day, as if people's minds could not be restored. In the afternoon, transactions in each market were silent, and the market was also stable. Because the flour market did not have much impulse, the wheat market also carried a slight vibration. As a result, this month was 0.2 points lower, November was 0.4 points lower, December was 0.5 points lower, January was unchanged, February was 0.3 points lower, and March was 0.4 points lower. The current wheat market is also gradually falling due to standards, falling by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan compared to the highest price. Gaoyou wheat opened at 3.3 yuan, and Zhenjiang wheat opened at 3.28 yuan, totaling more than 700 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Raised <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>| Resulting in an Increase of 0.25% |</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a decrease in the Dutch exchange rate, a strong increase in margin, and the situation in the public association's shipment aspect suddenly tightened. No. 24 coarse sand white was called for 14.95 yuan, which was 0.75% higher than the previous day. Considering the exchange rate and margin situation, this price was not too high. However, importers were reluctant to import because sales were not smooth. Later, a small number of transactions were made at 14.9 yuan, resulting in an increase of only 0.25%. No. 20 medium sand white was scarce, and No. 18 medium sand white remained at 14 yuan. The market for No. 8, 9, and 10 Dutch red sugar was firm, without any changes. Jianbing opened nearly 100 boxes of Top Standard Five Blessings White Ice from the Dalaihua Company, with each piece priced at 10.07 yuan, which was 0.02 yuan higher than the previous market. Other Chaoqing, this factory's ice flower blue, etc., were all called high in the market, but there were no transactions. It was found that the inventory was indeed weak, so it was difficult to turn loose.</p>

<p>Xiamen tangerine peel cakes have been scarce recently, and the market has stabilized. It was found that ordinary goods were priced at 19 yuan in the previous market, but the current market is slightly better. Customers are still interested in purchasing at 19.5 yuan, but the brand goods have already been delivered, and the ground price is difficult to determine, so there are no further arrivals. Shantou large tangerine peel cakes have been gradually transported in recently, and the current market is selling at around 23 yuan, with a stable trend.</p>
<h3 id="e213">Hardware White Iron Tile Variety is Extremely Scarce <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>White iron tiles are a fast-selling item during the rainy season. Every year at that time, the sales market is very prosperous. After this, there is no big outlet. However, this year's business is contrary to the norm. During the rainy season, there was no major transaction, so those engaged in this business are quite worried. However, recently, business has had the momentum of spring grass after rain. As a result, the market with weak inventory is always worried about a shortage of spot goods. The main ones are selected and recorded below:</p>
<p>No. 24 Quietly Thinking About Moving The transaction of No. 24 has also had the idea of moving in quietness recently. The standard is as high as 10.025 yuan per load, but the outlet is still good. It is heard that a total of 200-300 bundles were opened yesterday, which were purchased by the construction group and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Purchasing Office.</p>
<p>No. 26 Due to Lack of Strength There are very few spot goods of No. 26, and various groups need to buy them one after another. Therefore, the standard of No. 26 is due to lack of strength, and each load is as high as 11.25 yuan. It is heard that more than 100 bundles were also opened yesterday, but the less inventory, the better the popularity, so the market feels more outstanding.</p>
<p>No. 28 Seriously Deficient and Fast Selling Spot goods of No. 28 have been seriously deficient for one or two weeks, but buyers are still waiting for many days, and those who add more are coming one after another, so the market is selling fast, and the price is as high as 12.25 yuan per load, but there are no large quantities of spot goods to buy. It is heard that futures within one month have also been sold, and the price is 12 yuan. At this point, we can know how good the market is.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Iron Statue <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>The newspaper reported the other day that someone suggested abolishing the Anti-Civil War Grand Alliance and proposed casting iron statues for those who advocated civil war, placing them in important locations in this city, so as to serve as a warning. I don't really agree with this method of punishment because this kind of honorary punishment is not only outdated, but also not sufficient to be effective.</p>
<p>"People above three generations are afraid of good names; people below three generations are afraid of not having good names." Generally speaking, people in the past still valued integrity and virtue, so they cast iron statues of traitors like Qin Hui to warn everyone not to commit similar crimes. But the warlords of today only have power and territory in their eyes. They will not be deterred by your iron statues. As the saying goes, "Let them laugh and scold; I'll still be a good official." So, such a method was also used during the old warlord era. But what effect did it have?</p>
<p>The people oppose civil war and organize groups to oppose it. This has been stated repeatedly and emphatically. Suppose they still have some sense of the people in their minds, they definitely won't start another civil war. Suppose they still have the whole country in their minds, they also definitely won't dare to start another civil war given the deep and great external troubles before our eyes. Because they don't put the people and the country in their hearts at all, so external troubles are just external troubles, and civil war is just civil war. What else is there to say?</p>
<p>"If you can't leave a fragrant name for a hundred generations, why not leave a stinking name for ten thousand years?" This was originally a saying of the ancients. Because it's not easy to leave a fragrant name for a hundred generations, and it's not easy to leave a stinking name for ten thousand years. Therefore, casting iron statues for them is tantamount to promoting them. I'm afraid they'd even seek it and not get it. Moreover, in the past, there were only a few powerful and treacherous people like Qin Hui and Zhang Jun, so it was easy to cast iron statues. Now, it's not easy to understand the rights and wrongs of the two sides in the civil war. Should only the civil war leaders of one side be cast? Or should the civil war leaders of both sides be cast? There's also the fact that the current leaders of the civil war may not just be these few leaders. I'm afraid there are also many people behind the scenes. And the people behind the scenes are even more ruthless than those in front. So, should only the leaders in front be cast? | It wouldn't be fair |. If the leaders behind the scenes are all cast in it, not only would it be impossible to cast them all, but there would also be no evidence. Where would we even start?</p>
<p>Therefore, I don't advocate casting iron statues. Casting iron statues is completely a meaningless act. So, if we want to actively advocate the abolition of civil war, we should think of stronger and more effective methods. Otherwise, we can only listen to their civil war. They commit suicide and everyone goes down together one day.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Artificial Pigments of Yellow, Blue, and Green <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Erming</p>
<p>Artificial red and white pigments have already been published in previous issues of this journal, but other colors have not been mentioned, so I will select the simple and common ones to introduce below:</p>
<p>Artificial Yellow Pigments</p>
<p>Mosaic Gold SnS2 Method: Use 40 parts of tin powder, 35 parts of sulfur, and 25 parts of quicksand, or 80 parts of tetravalent tin oxide, 60 parts of sulfur, and 30 parts of saltpeter, or 20 parts of divalent tin sulfide, 10 parts of sulfur, and 8 parts of sal ammoniac. Place in an iron pot and heat to dark red to obtain golden tetravalent tin sulfide. If the temperature exceeds 650 degrees Celsius, this substance will thermally decompose into divalent tin sulfide. The iron pot has a lid and a gooseneck tube connecting to a condenser. The sal ammoniac is recovered here and can be reused. Mosaic gold and glue can be used as gold paint.</p>
<p>Yellow Lead Oxide Pbo Method: Place lead in a rotating furnace and oxidize it with air blown by a fan. The yellow lead oxide produced by the indigenous method of using saltpeter as an oxidizing agent in China is not durable and easily hardens and becomes useless. It dries easily with oil, so it is a drying agent. Yellow lead oxide is also used as a raw material for glass and porcelain enamel.</p>
<p>Barium Yellow BaCro4 Method: Add a barium chloride solution to a sodium dichromate solution. The resulting yellow precipitate is barium yellow. Its coloring power is not strong, but it is stable and durable. It is used in oil paints and watercolors.</p>
<p>Zinc Yellow ZnCro4 Method: Add potassium chromate to a neutralized hot solution of zinc sulfate, or boil 10 parts of potassium dichromate with 75 parts of zinc white. The resulting precipitate is zinc yellow. Zinc yellow is soluble in water, so it is not suitable for external use. Its covering power and coloring power are weak, but its color is very good. It is used to prevent rust on steel, but protective varnish must be applied.</p>
<p>Lead Yellow PdCro4 Method: Mix 40 parts of lead acetate in 160 parts of water to make solution A, and dissolve 31 parts of sodium dichromate in the same amount of water to make solution B. Mix solutions A and B to produce a precipitate. Filter and dry it. Alternatively, dissolve 100 pounds of lead nitrate in 600 pounds of water at 50 degrees Fahrenheit to make solution A, and dissolve 35 pounds of sodium dichromate in the same temperature and quantity of water to make solution B. Place 2,000 pounds of water at 50 degrees Fahrenheit in a precipitation tank, inject solutions A and B simultaneously and mix thoroughly, allow it to settle, filter, wash the precipitate thoroughly, heat to 180 degrees Fahrenheit and dry it. It is even better to use a vacuum drying method.</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>Cadmium Yellow Cds Method: Combine salt solutions containing Cc and S ions to obtain a precipitate. Cadmium yellow is used in painting inks.</p>
<p>Artificial Green Pigments</p>
<p>Chrome Green Cr2o(Oh)4 Method: Mix three parts of boric acid and eight parts of potassium dichromate with water to form a paste. Heat in a reverberatory furnace for four hours to obtain a porous substance called chrome borate. Pour into cold water to obtain chrome green. Chrome green is stable and resistant to alkali, light, and heat. It is used in automobile canopy paint, engine paint, wall paint, etc.</p>
<p>Arsenic Green Method: Mix four parts of sodium carbonate in 20 parts of water and dissolve three parts of trivalent arsenic oxide to make solution A. Mix three parts of copper sulfate (blue vitriol) in 40 parts of water to make solution B. Mix the two solutions to produce a precipitate. Filter to obtain arsenic green. Arsenic green is poisonous and has excellent color. It is used in artwork. If it is ground with oil for too long, the color will darken. However, it is durable in seawater, which is its advantage.</p>
<p>Copper Green Cu2(Oh)2Co3 Method: Add a sodium carbonate solution to blue vitriol solution to obtain a precipitate. Copper green is light-resistant, but its covering power is weak. It is used in painting inks.</p>
<p>Lead Green Method: Dissolve 27 to 28 parts of lead acetate and 3 to 4 parts of ferrous sulfate separately in water. Dissolve 3 to 4 parts of potassium ferrocyanide and 9 parts of sodium dichromate in the same container with water. Place water and 200 parts of heavy chalk powder in a precipitation tank. Inject all three solutions simultaneously while mixing and filtering. Dry the precipitate. Lead green is used in oil paints and inks. However, lead green is not suitable for oil paints in seaside air containing salt.</p>
<p>Zinc Green It is a mixture of zinc yellow and ultramarine blue. The manufacturing method is similar to lead green. It is suitable for interior decoration. Because it often spreads when exposed to water, it is often used in car paint, but protective varnish must be added to protect it.</p>
<p>Artificial Blue Pigments</p>
<p>Ultramarine Blue 2(Kfefe(Cn)6)3.5H2O Method: Dissolve 20 parts of ferrous sulfate in 300 parts of water to make solution A. Dissolve 20 parts of potassium ferrocyanide and add 1 part of hydrochloric acid in 600 parts of water to make solution B. Mix both solutions thoroughly, add 8 parts of bleaching powder, and promote oxidation with direct steam. Allow to settle, filter, and wash the precipitate multiple times in the filter. Dry it. Ultramarine blue has rich coloring power and is used in oil paints, inks, and leather paint.</p>
<p>Blue Lead The composition is very complex. It is obtained by sublimation of galena. It is not affected by sulfur-containing gases. It is used for protective paint for steel.</p>
<p>Ultramarine The chemical formula for less sandy ultramarine is 4Na2Al2Si2o8 + Na2S4, and for more sandy ultramarine, it is 2Na2Al2Si3Oio + Na2S4. There are two manufacturing methods:</p>
<p>(1) Sodium Sulfate Method: Use porcelain clay, sodium sulfate, carbon, sulfur, and sand as raw materials. Grind finely and place in a muffle furnace without contact with air. Heat to bright red for 8 hours to obtain a dark green porous body. Grind finely and spread in a shallow cloth tray about an inch thick. Cover with sulfur powder and heat to obtain a blue substance. Grind finely and wash with water to remove sodium sulfate and sodium sulfite. Boil with sodium sulfide solution to remove sulfur.</p>
<p>(2) Sodium Carbonate Method: Use porcelain clay, sodium carbonate, carbon, sulfur, and sand as raw materials. Grind finely and spread in a muffle furnace to a thickness of 14 inches. Heat for 3 to 4 weeks, and cool for 10 to 12 days. The resulting substance is blue on the top and greenish on the bottom. Separate and levigate with water. Ultramarine is heat-resistant and alkali-resistant and is used in wall paint and car paint. Lead-containing objects cannot be used together.</p>

<h3 id="e218">The Rickshaw Problem <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>In Japan, the place where rickshaws originated, they have gradually become rare and uncommon. This is because they know that pulling a rickshaw is inhumane and goes against human dignity, something that should not exist in the world. However, in our China, it is still thriving. Today one company [Li Yun], tomorrow another [Da Sheng]. Rickshaw companies are constantly increasing and developing. The old use them to exploit, the pullers risk their lives to survive, and passengers rely on them as a convenient means of transportation.</p>
<p>Just taking Shanghai as an example, if we stand on an ordinary street and pay attention, it probably won't take a minute before at least ten rickshaws pass by. As for the bustling downtown areas, of course, they are constantly passing by. There are so many people who make a living by pulling rickshaws! Someone asks: [How can there be so many people in Shanghai pulling rickshaws?] The fact tells you: [They are not locals. They abandoned their homes, gardens, fields, land, hoes, plows, stone mills, water mortars, cattle, chickens... and ran to Shanghai to suffer and struggle?] But why did they abandon everything they had! The answer is very simple: [Bandits, disasters, high interest rates, heavy taxes: and the expansion of capitalist forces into the countryside... The countryside thus collapsed unconditionally, and everything they had was destroyed! So one by one, they came to the cities. What can the cities give them to do? Inevitably, they became slaves of the capitalists.</p>
<p>[Labor is sacred], can this be applied to the coolies who make a living by pulling rickshaws? This is simply a deceitful and numbing phrase for the suffering and weak! Some people think that rickshaw pullers earn one or two dollars a day, which accumulates over time and is quite considerable. If hard work is compensated, that would be fine. In fact, even ten times that amount cannot compensate for one ten-thousandth of what they sacrifice! Because they (1) overwork; (2) are malnourished; (3) lack sleep; (4) live in terrible conditions... Of course, their health is destroyed! What remains, if you look, are just yellow faces, skinny bones, hunched waists, crooked backs, and two legs moving!</p>
<p>Some people have also realized that pulling a rickshaw is not a human</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>life, it is cruel and inhumane. However, they only [realize it], and at most they passively do not ride. Sometimes, because of urgency or distance, they have to rely on it to walk. At this time, if the rickshaw puller runs a little slower, they forget about [humanity] [ghostly morality], and they will definitely kick the footrest [Pig! Faster!] Or if the rickshaw puller argues about the price, they will quickly repay them with their mouths, humming [bastard!]... Or some people think [in Shanghai, where merchants gather and material civilization prospers, rickshaws should not be kept, because this damages China's international dignity and causes foreigners to laugh at our cultural backwardness, so they should be unconditionally expelled like prostitutes in Luoyang...] These, these, like this, like that, is this considered [humanity]? Is this considered sympathy? Or is this considered a complete solution to the rickshaw problem? Get out of here!</p>
<p>Now, we plead for the rickshaw pullers, asking the capitalists themselves to realize that [humans eating humans will only lead to everyone's destruction and ruin]! What's the point? Secondly, let us join hands and work together to re-evaluate and rebuild an ideal new life, a new society! Let us first take these two paths:</p>
<p>(1) Because they come from the countryside, the countryside should be scientifically constructed, the rural economy should be consolidated, rural education should be developed; and large-scale, planned reclamation groups should be organized, focusing on production and development.</p>
<p>(2) Because they have no work, the rich should abandon their consistent policy of exploiting others for their own benefit, and put aside their traditional speculative and adventurous businesses. Please gather strong capital.</p>
<p>Establish many large-scale, scientifically managed factories, focusing on production and construction.</p>
<p>Finally, I shout again: [The rickshaw problem is not a local, individual problem, it is a whole social problem!]</p>
<p>Generous</p>

<p>— Iron Blood Man</p>
<p>[It's been several years since I last saw your friends, Mr. L. Since the Shanghai War, they've moved to a new house on M Road in a certain concession!] My sister said to me.</p>
<p>[Of course: life is important! Do they not want their lives! And they are now a family with the added character of "rich"! ] I replied while flipping through the newspaper.</p>
<p>[But...] A command suddenly came from my heart; I had to pay them a visit. So I put down the newspaper, immediately put on a long gown that was neither too long nor too short, and ran out the door. It was only eight o'clock, and after running for about half an hour, I finally found the new house. Suddenly, I heard a sharp voice, as if scolding me! I turned around and looked, ah! It turned out to be Miss S, Mr. C's sister.</p>
<p>[We live in this house, please come in and have a seat, my brother just went out!] She said to me with a face smiling like a Buddha.</p>
<p>[Ah! Mr. C, it's been a long time!] Her mother said with a smile.</p>
<p>[It's been a long time; since the Shanghai War, have you suffered any losses?] I asked.</p>
<p>[We didn't suffer any losses, anyway...] [She was interrupted].</p>
<p>[Mom! Brother is back], Miss S ran over and shouted like a flying arrow.</p>
<p>[What wind blew you here, Mr. Jun? It's been many years since I've seen you,] Mr. L said somewhat coldly, with a hint of pride.</p>
<p>Later, we chatted about this and that, and after talking for a while, [have some snacks], he took out some snacks and asked me to eat them. I was honest and didn't hold back, eating a lot, not caring about anything;</p>
<p>[Alas! Today was extremely "unlucky"!] He said with a sigh.</p>
<p>[What "unlucky"? You might as well tell me], I asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>Because she [Mr. L's lover] promised me yesterday that she would definitely go with me to the salon tomorrow to get a manicure. This morning, we both ran to our destination. In less than half an hour, she got it done and paid a dollar to that woman [the Western woman who does manicures]. Later, I also took out a dollar to get a manicure, but she accidentally made my finger bleed, which really hurt me a lot. I knew that for the price of one dollar, I would get [pain]. Aren't you angry], he shouted through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>Hearing these words almost choked me to death; I had just taken a bite of cake, which was stuck in my throat, neither up nor down, and I used all my sucking power to swallow it.</p>
<p>[Think about it, someone like you is really stupid. If you had donated that dollar to the Northeastern Volunteer Army, you could have bought a few bullets and killed the "dwarves" [Japanese] to your heart's content! "Why not?" ] (A suitable ending)</p>
