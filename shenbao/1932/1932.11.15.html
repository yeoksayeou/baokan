<p>— 又玄</p>
<p>世界第一次大戰而後軍國主義之惡燄略見輕減國際和平之傾向亦漸趨濃厚然而事過境遷瘡痍方後國際間之嫉視繼之以興軍備競爭於焉更烈大有返還十九世紀末葉迄乎二十世紀初期軍國主義勃發時代之情勢然歷史演進决無重複同一模型之理不過堕性的反動固常有之今日軍國主義侵略行爲之盛極一時即其明證也日本之大陸政策掠奪我東北三省三百七十六萬七千七百餘方里之地面蹂𨈆我三千萬同胞在近世史中實爲空前之暴舉當此時也在日本固可謂志得意滿遂其歷年謀我之素願達其兼併亞洲大陸之野心矣中國雖甚疲弱抗抵爭鬥之力亦欠堅强但禍迫眉睫亦未必甘心忍受伸首待戮故瀋陽事變以來迄於錦州失守我國當局雖隱忍持重而民間熱血之士則不顧生死揭竿而起者遍於東北武器優良誠不及敵方萬一而不計利害得失这民族精神足以激勵國民之奮發喚起世界一秀之同情彼窮兵　武之日閥縱自謂手法高妙激動彼國人原始的侵略精神舉國一致其實係軍閥包辦以圖「滿洲」北進將窺伺西比利亞南進可以侵蝕華北其軍力姑留待後論即以財政一項言彼已捉襟見肘勢難再行繼續支出若大軍費彼國稍明事勢者皆覺其局勢之危故高橋財長查定來年度預算竟削去軍部新預算要求至於二分之一（陸軍新要求削去一億六千四百萬元（日金）海軍新要求削去二億八千七百萬元）軍部方面則倡言抗議陸相荒木之言曰</p>
<p>「···一般人以爲陸軍方面新要求的兵備改善費是拿來救濟中小工商業者這是一種大錯誤陸軍方面總合國力國防財力等加以考慮認爲非此不可絕沒有想到救濟中小商業若果對預算案讓一步則到如今這些努力全歸泡影目前正是緊要關頭豈可功虧一簣所以不可吝惜那五萬萬十萬萬的欵項譬如壯年的人要求工作資本工作的時候自然會出汗會疲勞甚至因工作而受微傷亦未可知但是很快就會復原日本以定不致於亡的···」</p>
<p>以日本今日國勢而論豈僅出汗疲勞何止稍微受摥商困於市農困於野國庫收入總計不過十三億三千三百萬元日金而支出則突過二十二億三千萬元其間陸海軍費（包括增加預算在内）</p>
<p>陸軍費　　　　預算總額　　　　四四七·○○○千元日金</p>
<p>海軍費　　　　預算總額　　　　三七二·○○○千元</p>
<p>此種假定數字雖經一再斟酌閣僚反復詳商尙恐軍部與内閣之間内閣與政黨之間不免有種種波瀾也齋藤爲海軍先盟在海軍方面或可不致發生重大問題而陸軍方面雖暫時表示因五千萬元之增加而踱步然侵略之野心不戢軍費之儣大將何能已明年度預算旣屬空前膨脹其財政情形又將何如</p>
<p>近年以來日本國債即飛躍的增加明年財政情勢現時之可見者如下</p>
<p>㈠迄本年九月底止日本國債總額六十三億零八百萬元日金</p>
<p>㈠本年尙未發行之公債額六億一千四百萬日金</p>

<p>㈠明年度發行公債額至少十億元日金</p>
<p>㈠照現時日幣市價外匯低落外債增加額約十五億元日金</p>
<p>以上六項合計當在一百零一億以上矣前此筆者推測日本二三年之後其國債將增加至百億達於全日本國富十分之一此種負債如是激劇增加則日本疲敝之民其何以堪然而彼日閣者則以爲「十億五十億不可咅惜」中日間民族鬥爭决非三年五載可得而解决此種長期的變相戰爭如我國人能繼續堅持者彼對東北軍費勢必與年月具增五年十年五十年之後日本現有國富將盡飛散於烟彈之中消磨乎槍刀之上吾人回憶法國路易十四之時法國非不强也其惟一致命傷即在乎財政的破綻今之日本其國力就相對方面比較未必超過當時之法蘭西而軍事費之消耗匪特遠過當日之法在現世諸國中亦推第一乃欲打破世界和平蓄意挑戰則又爲戰前之德意志也公理正義固不能制其强權鐵血敎訓又將何如</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚蟹的解剖  瞻廬九月團臍十月尖，團什麽？團是師團。尖什麽？尖是侵略入於尖銳化。　　蟹稱江湖使者，這是江湖中的蟹，不是海洋中的蟹：若是海蟹，决不自居於江湖使者，一定要自稱爲太平洋中的覇王。橫行郭索，率領着蟹子蟹孫去尋殖民地，又都是個個渾身武裝，竤便呌做武裝移民。堅厚的甲殼，是蟹的唯一的護身之具；不是鐵甲車，定是坦克車。　　兩個鉗子，要鉗住世界的與論，呌你們有了開口的機會，開口的塲所，依然默默無聲，開口不得。若要開口，須待它放鬆了鉗子以後。　　蟹最怕赤化，要是穿了一件海瑞式的大紅袍，蟹便沒有命活。蟹和辛辣的東西以及紫蘇等物，都是很忌的；除非被捕以後，供人大嚼；那才放入鍋子裏和紫蘇一起兒煑，煑好以後，蘇着些芥辣化的　末，送入老　的口中。看爾橫行到幾時？只剩那殘餘的赤化甲殼，丢𥩀在�垃圾桶裏，惹人嘆息。　　蘇維埃，怕是紫蘇吧！加拉罕，怕是芥辣化吧！蟹若走入紫蘇裏面，和芥辣化謀親善；只怕親善的結果，沾染了滿身赤的色彩。但是，橫行的蟹，正向那紫蘇堆裏去追尋，正和那芥辣化的人物去接近；唉！秋老難逃滿背紅，是這時候了！軟殼蟲的中國  徐絜　　丨難道還是睡獅嗎？丨　　讀申報月刋第四號杜若君「美國與東北問題，」中有句道：「我們只怪中國自身是個軟殼蟲，只怪帝國主義者的爲目前些許私利而遂不顧後來的無窮大患，！顧首不顧尾的「鴕鳥政策」之錯誤。」在下不覺起了許多感想。本來國聯誰不抱着「鴕鳥政策，」藏頭露尾，自顧不遑，誰來管你閒事。雖然這虎狼角逐的荒野，只有自保生命，那弱小的綿羊和花斑鹿的生命，那個放在心上！　　在夸大狂的中國人，從前是自負爲東亞的「睡獅。」獅是獸中的王，可惜正在打磕睡，可是一朝醒來，鳴聲如銅鉦，那荒野裏的虎·豹·豺·狼·便要帖耳曳尾起來，𫃊𫃊地抖個不住，給那隻大�獅吃了。可是這隻大獅，到如今還不肯蘇醒，鼻息如雷，正和陳希夷的高臥華陰一般；不但這些豺·狼·虎·豹·要來喫它，便是么魔小醜的老鼠，也要來咬一口。而且，咬去了它的右耳，還是麻木不仁的不覺得，依然做其南柯好夢！當然，在這班耗子瞧來，說這不是「睡獅，」簡直是隻「睡猪！」　　　唉！眞是每况愈下，猪還是有脊椎的動物，現在竟是一條蟲了。你瞧我們國裏的人，多是貪得無厭，有了一省想兩省，有了十萬想百萬，這不是很像蝜蝦嗎？蝜蝦性喜負物，多多益善，非至壓死在地上，不肯罷休，這不是很像我們的國民性嗎？蟋蟀螞蟻，最喜爭鬥，同類相殘，蠻觸紛爭，我們從不見蟋蟀和螻蛄鬥，螞蟻和蚯蚓鬥，勇於内戰，雖勝不武，這又不是很像我們的國民性嗎？唉！軟殼蟲的中國人呀！你難道沒有自衛的方法嗎？提倡婦女職業  金不同　　丨將來提倡男子職業丨　　婦女職業的聲浪，一天高似一天。大人先生的夫人小姐，都迂尊降貴的到社會上服務，於是乎老百姓小百姓的妻子女兒，本來在絲廠裡做湖絲阿姐的，在工廠裡做女工的，都名正言順的從賤民階級裡，一躍而戴上了又漂亮，又時代化的頭銜，呌做職業界的婦女了。不錯，我們睜大了眼孔子看。政府的各部，各科，各會，都有女部員，女科員，女書記。縣長大人，法官老爺，一向是男子做的，現在也有女法官，女縣長了。以上海而論，商店櫃台裡，銀行收支處，現在差不多十之二三，都是女職員了。據說近來郵政局招考，也錄取了不少女子。遊戲場，吃食店，儘量的聘用女招待，醫院裏聘用女看護，不必說了，就是理髮店，按摩院，也都是女子找尋職業的好去處。至於那些開設在弄堂裏的市敎育局立過案的私立小學校裏，更充斥着月支車馬費大洋十元的女敎員。此外如絲廠，紗廠，花邊廠，香烟廠，甚麽廠，甚麽廠，不招工人則已，招則儘先錄用女工。　　大家歡迎女子的理由，據說，一則是提倡婦女職業，二則是女子柔順而心細，對人總是和和氣氣的，做事都是勤勤謹謹的，不像男子那麽暴躁而糊塗，對人常要疾言厲色的，做事專想草率偷懶的。有人說這話說得果然不錯，但是將來男子的位置，都給女子个佔去了，那麽怎樣呢？嗄，朋友，莫急，到那時家裡燒飯洗衣，抱孩子，正是男子的工作。要不然的話，再提倡男子職業也不　。職業三女子（上）  徐鵑雲　　三位有職業的女子，伊們起先在一所偏僻的小房子裏，一切都很簡陋，日子久了，覺着生活上很不舒服，又不便去邀朋友來玩，好朋友漸漸地疏遠了，因此三人以定在適中地點，找一近又美麗又要潔凈的房子。很凑巧，不久便找着了，這所房了，建築在一處美麗的小花園中。　　在伊們進行之先，便决定由伊們永遠頂下來，以免去一切鎖碎的糾紛，辦好了很穩妥的手續。　　這所房樓上有兩間一樣大小的房間，一間浴室，一間小房間，樓下呢，𢊍房之外，有一間�長屋子，兩間都開着窗，另外有一間比較小些，和樓上的兩間彷彿，伊們便將樓上的兩間和樓下的那間，做了三個人的臥室，屋子裡安置着汽爐，其它的裝設，便由各人自已去支配。這間樓下的長屋子，便做了餐室，也算是會客室，裝好了火爐和無線電音樂，樓上那間小間兒呢，堆堆箱子零碎東西，同時也可以算是有其它工作的工作室。房金連捐錢每月約六镑十二先令，三人分攤不過兩鎊四先令，熱汽水汀都算在内了。　　新僱了一個女傭人，冬天讓伊在屋子裏籠火，除了星期六，每天晚上預備晚飯，早晨呢，拾掇拾掇𢊍房，摕摕地，擦擦地板，還有晨要�緊的便是三人每天的中餐，到了星期休息日，便由三人分些工作，這位女傭人，每星期工資十二先令，每人平均撥負四先令娼妓  傅紅夢　　丨是婦女們的良心職業比奸商們要榮耀得多丨　　一說到婦女的職業問題來，娼妓的兩個字，使會侵　上我的心頭。娼妓是不是一種職業？能不能算做一種職業？爲什麽被們人看得這樣低賤？這幾個問題，便時常的繞在我的腦海裏。　　當然，那些自甘墮落的婦女，在這裏是一個例外，我們研究的，是一些爲生活壓迫着像别種婦女們，爲了生活壓迫而操着某種職業是一樣。本來，這是無容諱言的，做主席，是把名望或是某種才能來維持他的生活，一切都是一樣。娼妓，伊們把自已的色相和肉，來换取自已的生活，同樣的是一種職業。大家都是爲了生活，娼妓也是爲了生活。誰能不顧到自已生活，天下又有幾個高尙得像主席的這樣職業呢？　　似乎，這誰都不能否認，無論某種的經營和職業，其中至少總帶些不平均的：或是倚仗着某種的勢力，來維持自已的職業，惟其娼妓，伊們不用倚靠着這一切，伊們有的是自已的色相和肉，操着極公平的生意，比一切都誠實，比一切都偉大。　　本來，社會習俗的牽制，一切經濟的崩潰，更爲了一些不知自愛的婦女們的影響，於是乎便造成這種賣淫的職業的可恥。其實，我們又那能責罰到這些操着淫業的娼妓們呢？伊們爲了生活，爲了社會的遺棄，才操着這種低級的職業，但是比較起一些奸商們，豈不榮譽得多，淸高得多嗎？在現在的社會裏，婦女職業是如此落後，我們除了讚美這娼妓的職業外，我們又應當怎樣呢？死之岔道㈩㈣  范烟橋　　後來得了一個解答了。左鄰的小珠，吿訴伊；「舞女的生活最舒服了，收入也好，像伊身段，一定學得出的。」愛姑聽了，雖歆羨，但是什麽呌做跳舞？根本上沒有這種常識，如何可以　竿充數，因此向小珠說：　　「小珠姊！學跳舞容易麽？」　　「容易！容易！」小珠狠高興的指示捃說：「一百塊錢，兩個月，包學會，我只學了六個禮拜，連最難的探戈舞，都學會了。」愛姑說：「兩個月的食宿，再化一百塊錢夠麽？」　　「夠了！夠了！」小珠放低了聲音，再說：你在兩禮拜内，學會了幾種淺近的，普通的步法，就可以到舞埸上去找拖車了，有了拖車，還愁喫喝麽？」　　愛姑在蘇州歆羨上海的心理，和在鄕間歆羨城裏，是同樣的，人家化了錢到上海去，逛了幾天，只帶些廣東香蕉，泰豐餅乾還來，誇耀給孩子們看，博得孩子們歌調，是怪沒意識的。我到上海去，學習現時代的藝術，解决我以後的生活問題，這一種的行動，比韓慕良到首都去更光明，因爲他只是仗着過房爺的奥援，去搶飯碗啊。因此伊狠起勁的辦行裝，一面把租住和房屋退還房主，把應用器具，寄在小姊妹家裏，只帶了些輕便的，値錢的東西去，在車站上堆了四件。小珠還在掩口笑伊：「像新嫁娘，帶了許多笨貨，怪累墜的。」愛姑說：　　「天氣快冷，少了一件，又要去買，原來沒有錢，能省一文，便有一文存在着，將來有一文的用處。」　　小珠把嘴一披說：「你有了多少兒女，要創些家當給他們麽？「江西人釘碗，自顧自。」今天有錢，今天化，至多防明天落雨，第三天决然必操心的了，因爲自有不甘漃莫的人來找你了。這裏面大槪是衣服，上海時髦的女人，所做的衣服，肯用過了一個需要的時期的，已經算是做人家了，誰也不會把春天所做的衣服，留到秋天再用的，至於民國十九年的衣服，到了二十年，早已從典當而過渡到石路上衣莊店裏喴買了。」</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>丨處世藝術之十丨</p>
<p>不論西皮，二簧，十八摸，四季想思，九腔十八調，調調和得落，就是胡調，胡調的名詞，本不作如此講，所以用胡調而不用和調，但是現在普通的用法，大低如此。</p>
<p>胡調名詞，由來已久，晋愍帝時，石勒執王浚。浚駡曰，「胡奴調乃公，何凶逆如此，」這是胡調的濫觴，現在所用的胡調，大抵是和調而不是胡調，假定胡調不得法，便加上一個瞎子，呌做瞎胡調，或加上一個濫字，呌做濫胡調，事事可以混在裏頭，是胡調，處處可以兜得轉，是胡調，朋友隨便約你去做什麽，便做什麽，也是胡調，胡調眞是絕妙的處世藝術。</p>
<p>甲派得勢，我便向甲派表示好感，是胡調，乙派失勢，我便向乙派表示失望，也是胡調，甲曰好，我便說眞是出色，乙曰不好，我便說眞是無用，眞是弄差，唐太宗嘗止一樹下曰，此佳樹，宇文土及從而美之不止，帝正色曰，魏公嘗湖我遠佞臣，我不知佞人爲誰，意疑汝而未明也，今日果然，此是胡調而被人識破者。宋韓伲胄用事，趙師鐸和之，伲胄嘗與衆客游南園，過山莊，顧竹籬茅含曰，此眞田舍間氣象，但少鷄鳴犬吠耳，俄聞犬嘷叢薄，視之乃師鐸也，伲胄大笑，此是胡調而未被人識破者。</p>
<p>宇文士及趙師鐸都是胡調名手，士及不幸而遇唐太宗，遂至失敗，趙師鐸幸遇韓伲胄，因此胡調得落，如此胡調亦有幸不幸歟。</p>

<p>— 佳禮</p>
<p>「鐺··鐺·····」</p>
<p>滬西某大學的上課鐘正在淸脆的敲着，上應用國文的同學們在這不斷的鐘聲裏，魚貫的走入了六十三號敎室。</p>
<p>敎授這一課的張先生，是一位年過半百的老夫子，身軀很高，說話的聲音十分瞭亮，不過有時參雜着「拉塊」的腔調罷了。今天他照例的提着他那三尺來長的「司的克」，昻起那戴着瓜皮小帽的頭，挺着胸膛，慢慢的鍍進了六十三號敎室。</p>
<p>那敎室中嘈雜的聲浪，頓時寗息了，同學們一個個的屏心靜氣，看着先生寫在黑板上的字，聽着先生批評書上的</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>文章。</p>
<p>黑板上寫着「公文程式第四十二頁，舉例三十。」先生批評的當然便是這篇文字了。</p>
<p>先生朗聲的讀道「司法調查委員會呈國民政府文，摘由，呈請頒布民法」「······現在民律未布，司法根據前淸不完不備之現行律，引律旣窮，則據該法官之所謂條理者以行武斷，以此確定人民權利，至爲危險」，他頓了一頓說：「看文章最要緊便是要明瞭牠的意義，你們看這段文字，不是明明白白的說現行律不好嗎？」</p>
<p>他隨又接着商聲的讀下去「查前淸法律編查館所編之民律草案，選擇各國民律至精之法理，又派員調查各省之習慣，審愼周詳，始成此律。」先生很奮興的讀完這一節，便開始批評說：</p>
<p>「民律所以保障民權，前淸同民國的政體不同，所以前淸的法律，便不能適用到民國，你們看這呈文開首不是說現行律不好嗎？可是下面却不對了，說什麽民律草案是選擇各國民律至精之法理，什麽調查習慣，審愼周詳，始成此律。現行律便是民律草案。旣反對之於前，而又贊成之於後，前言不對後語，豈非一個大大的漏洞嗎？」他一氣說到此地，頓了一頓，將那微笑的面孔，像夏天用的自動風扇似的，由敎室的南面一直擺到北面。看看那些學生，一個個靜默無聲地坐着，有的頻頻點頭，好似說，先生的批評眞不錯。有的張嘴在那兒笑，好似說，先生的批挟使我們頓開茅塞之心啊！</p>
<p>「···························」</p>
<p>「先生丨」一位同學突然的打破了當時的沉寂，驚醒了先生的幻想，說「先生你纏錯了啊！那現行律同民律草案不是一件事，現行律自是現行律，民律草案自是民律草案呀！」</p>
<p>「哈！哈！哈！」敎室中頓時充滿了笑聲，因爲大家不能再忍了。</p>
<p>這一來先生窘了。連忙分辯說，「</p>
<p>就算牠是兩件事，然而我批評的是文氣呀！在文氣上看，這篇文字究竟是不好啊！你們不信，我改給你們看，我只要改上兩個字，那文氣便順過來了。」</p>
<p>那位同學說：「我是說先生將事實纒錯了，我並沒有說先生的文章不好，先生的文章當然是高明的呀！</p>
<p>笑聲剛要起來，不得已的又忍着了，因爲又有一位同學說話了。他說「先生現在我們不要去管事實罷，那是沒有什麽關係，先生還是繼續的講文氣罷！</p>
<p>「哈！哈！哈」大家笑得更厲害！</p>
<p>「鐺···鐺···」外面敲着救先生命的下課鐘了。</p>
<p>學生們像潮水般的立起來，含着笑容的擠出了敎室。</p>
<p>先生呢？將他的頭低着，腰　着，他的「司的克」拖着，好似喪家之犬的尾巴，怱怱的逃向敎員休息室去了！（移酬助東北義勇軍）</p>

<p>— 吾</p>
<p>黃天福自從發現了老婆有了姘頭以後，便决定要設法報復，一個堂堂男子漢怎麽好做烏龜的呢？而且街坊鄰舍都已知道，哼！這簡直是終身的奇恥大辱了。於是他想：</p>
<p>「對了，一定要報服，非報服不可。但是，怎麽報復呢？用什麽方法呢？那只有殺死她，而且將奸夫也一同殺死。總有一天，當我知道她們在幽會的時候，我可以用頂好的手槍將她們一同打死，一粒子彈穿過兩個人的胸膛！呀！那鮮紅的血，那是多麽痛快呀！當然，一個男子漢應當有這樣的雄心。······但是頂好的手槍從什麽地方來呢？買嗎？那裏有那麽多的錢，借嗎？又沒有辦法。······對了，我可以去買一把刀，一把鋒銳的利刀，那也是一樣的，而且親自血刃，更是痛快啊！······不，不行，那個奸夫是一個彪雄大漢，並且是拜了老頭子的惡覇，每一個惡覇都是有武藝的，我不見得一定打得過他。對了，這不好，太冒險了，爲了一個女人犯不着自已拚命。那末怎樣呢？無疑義的，一定要報復。哦，不錯，我可以只殺死老婆一個人，那是不成問題的，難道一個男人殺一個女人不嬴麽？不，殺死女人讓奸夫留着麽？那眞太沒有志氣了。同時「捉奸要捉雙」，只殺死一個女人，沒有證據，不是自已反要坐牢麽？這怎麽成？······但是總得報復呀！唔，不錯，我可以自殺，奸夫奸婦一個也不殺死他。我死之後，在别人一定會知道我是爲什麽死的，當然一定有人訾駡她，咒咀她，讓她受社會批判，讓她到死也負着不貞的罪名。這樣她便要慚愧無地的，她便要永遠無面目見人的。哟！這樣的，比殺死她還要來得痛快。是的，我一定自殺！自殺！······可是自殺便是自已死去，這是多麽可怕呀！我還要過着許多好日子，還有許多繁華美麗在等着我，我爲什麽要自殺呢？這是多麽愚蠢的事啊！不過······是的，我可以不要她，馬上敎她離開我，斷絕夫妻關係，難道這不也是報復的方法之一嗎？當然，我抛棄了她，我便不是烏龜了，這樣，誰也不殺，一個人也不必死，這不是十全齊美的辦法嗎？對了，我一定這樣做了。」</p>
<p>黃天福最後就這樣决定了。不久以後，多年來同床共枕的嬌妻便在自已的賣妻契約之下和奸夫一同生活去了。不過他的子女却從此十分憤恨的痛哭流淚，雖然他自已常以寛大自慰。</p>

<p>— 一新</p>
<p>一道很高的圍牆裏面，有一座新房子，從門裏望進去，漆得堂而皇之，非常的美麗。廳上的佈置，都是光彩奪目，知他是有錢的人家。有一個老太婆　　在天井裏的木　　　　　　的花　絮絮的一串素珠口唸南無阿彌陀佛。南無阿彌陀佛。這時候從外面走進了二個穿西裝的少年，手裏　着公事皮夾，走到老太婆的面前。拿公事夾的一位少年說：老婆婆，我們代東北義勇軍募捐來的。現在這冷的天氣，東北更然冷寒得厲害了，早已冰天雪地。可憐義勇軍，在這冰天雪地裏，仍是努力的殺賊。這樣的勇氣，我們來募集錢資，預備去做絲棉外衣，使他不致寒冷，好多殺幾個矮奴。請老婆婆助幾百元吧。</p>
<p>（老太婆一聽少年的話，要他助幾百塊錢，馬上怒目橫視了少年說：哼！你到好大口氣，我家是不是有這多的錢去助他呢？沒有，沒有，請你到别人家去。南無阿彌陀佛，南無阿彌陀佛。</p>
<p>（少年）你多沒有，二十元，十元，也可以助，不要緊的。一·是老婆婆愛國的熱心。二·也是慈善家，使他不致疼死，大大的一個好事。</p>
<p>（老太婆）哼！我一塊也不願，他東爭西奪，常常的打仗，各謀自已的飯碗滿。現在又和東洋人打起來了。菩薩呀，願你顯靈，把他們個個疼死，到還</p>
<p>淸淸靜靜的太平了，這是多麽的好呢？南無阿彌陀佛，南無阿彌陀佛。</p>
<p>另一個少年說：我們們看錯了，這樣高大的房子裏，原來是一個亡國奴。</p>
<p>老太婆說了一聲哼！亡國奴不亡國奴，和你無關，我們有菩薩保佑，决不會受苦的，南無觀世音菩薩，南無地藏王菩薩。</p>
<p>少年搖着頭一邊走，一邊說！你去靠菩薩，唉！嘆了一口氣，迷信之害，有這樣的毒，足見比毒的還毒呢？</p>
<p>老太婆正在唸菩薩的時候，走進來了一和尙，慌忙的立起來，說一聲師傅坐坐。倒了一杯茶遞給和尙。</p>
<p>和尙笑容滿面的接了茶說：老太太你好呀，長久沒有到我廟裏來，我很是記念你，今日特地兒來望望。</p>
<p>（老太婆）多謝師傅，因爲我的媳婦，到娘家去了，已經好幾個月，還沒有回來　　　　　　　　　　樣的。我這幾日還時常的頭痛　一時冷一時熱我早要到你廟裏去求求菩薩　不知我會死不會死？</p>
<p>（和尙）老太太，你近幾日，因爲掃掃地，刷刷　，想是吃力了。我明日替你求大帝菩薩，拿幾包仙丹來呑呑，自然會好的。你的精神很好，决不會死的，况你熱心的敬愛菩薩，菩薩也保佑你不會死的。</p>
<p>（老太婆　）哈！！的笑着說：師傅我眞的不會死嗎？請你求菩薩的時候，也替我問一問？保佑我多做幾年人，你不可忘記。</p>
<p>（和尙）我不會忘記的，現在我的廟裏，求菩薩和燒香客很多，每日擁擠着，我想再添造一進後大殿，彫尊彌陀佛，兩旁造十八尊羅漢，故特來和你商量，你道好嗎？</p>
<p>（老太婆）這廟我早想發心，添造一塺後殿，因我沒有暇，以致躭誤到今，你現在已經發心了，這是再好沒有，是應當要擴充的。</p>
<p>（和尙）我緣事簿已經拿來了，把一本擺在你處，請你帮帮菩薩的忙。</p>
<p>（老太婆）這是我分内的事，你明天來，我和你去寫。</p>
<p>「和尙拿着一本緣事簿，遞給老太婆」</p>
<p>老太婆一看說：這樣薄的一本簿子，如何夠寫我們這大的一個村莊呢？你明天再帶幾本來。我先派算你知道·王家太太二百元，李家奶奶也是二百元，張家老太太也是二百元，還有少奶奶一百元，一寫幾百元的很多呢？我自已預備寫三百元，二百元寫之我自已的姓氏，還有一百元寫之無名氏。倘被我的兒子看見，比别的太太多，就要嘰哩咕嚕駡我，我先通知你。</p>
<p>（和尙）多蒙太太的美意，有如此的熱心，最要緊菩薩保佑你，脚輕手健，我去了，老太太你請坐坐。</p>
<p>老太婆送到門口頭，說一聲師傅慢慢去。</p>

<h3 id="c183">嘉寳幼年的寫實（續） <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 昨</p>
<p>我吿訴她哥哥，我對葛雷泰做女伶而得到現在這樣的榮名，覺得希奇丨或者至少是有趣。</p>
<p>她那比她大七歲的哥哥，長得很英俊，熊度和言語也怪可愛，他聽了我的話，搖搖頭，二只眼睛發出異樣的光彩；笑道：</p>
<p>「是的，我想這是奇怪的。」他手裏玩弄着一枝紙烟。「但是我仍舊不驚異，當她小的時候，她就有一種使你不得不相信的魔力。當然，我是站在她哥哥的立塲來講。但是的確，她的種種能使你不得不相信的。」</p>
<p>「但是她怎麽恰巧揀了一個做戲的事業呢？是不是偶然的觸𢴰，還是老早就有了這樣的志願？」</p>
<p>嘉寳的哥哥笑了。</p>
<p>「她在很小的時候，就常常歡喜做戲的。所以我說她本來有這種志向的。」</p>
<p>然後我們談到各種的事業，談到關於多人都靠了野心的慫恿，而達到成功的道路。最後我再談到他妹妹的事業，並在這時，我感到一種幽默的情趣。</p>
<p>「有時這似乎是奇怪，她能有如你所說的今日的名望，不過我還當她是我的小妹妹；我也眞難相信她已是個有名的人物了，我覺得她始終是我的小妹妹。」</p>
<p>在我們的談話裏，充滿着一種自然的情趣，可愛的舉動，和完全的理解。根本是因爲嘉寳的哥哥丨他的名字呌思文，格斯泰夫蓀丨是個有名的有趣人。他和一個生在美洲的女郎結婚，並曾遊遍了大陸，但他還要到美國去游歷。</p>
<p>不過上面這許多都是她哥哥，她自已家裏人的話。所以我决定要再同别的知道嘉寳幼時的人去攀談。至嘉寳生出和長成的勃來金街三十二號的屋子裡，我和依門鈕兒龍夫人會談，她很記得這位名呌嘉寳的女郎，是生在她隔壁的門裡的。</p>
<p>○　　○　　○　　○　　○　　○　　○　　○</p>
<p>龍夫人是一個矮胖的婦人，正看護她臥病的丈夫，她怨艾自已的境遇，但在講到嘉寳的芳名時，她那淺藍的眼睛裏，就發出愉快的光輝了。</p>
<p>「是的，我很記得她。」</p>
<p>我問她幾個關於嘉寳幼時的問題。</p>
<p>龍夫人微微的一喟，她回憶到過去的情境。</p>
<p>「她是永久快樂，富有生氣的。她常常在我這房裡游玩，我眞歡喜她，人人都是沒理由地歡喜她。」龍夫人嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「我對於她今日的成功並不驚奇，他是有成女伶的天才的，因爲她幼時······」（未完）</p>

<p>— 振華</p>
<p>好萊塢的影星，大多數是出於齊格飛歌舞班的，所以影界對它十分重視，歌舞的領班，齊格飛君，最近忽然以重病逝世，因此，埃娣康脫，瑪倫密勒，瑪麗特萊絲勒，桃樂珊麥克關爾，惠爾羅傑士·曼琳黛維絲，羅范麗，琵麗杜美，許多大明星，聽了這個惡耗，非常悲傷。</p>
<p>齊格飛的夫人，琵麗白蘭克，她正在給雷電華公司攝片，近將完竣，她忽然接到了她丈夫逝世的電報，於是悲痛幾絕，同時，好萊塢的明星，爲了這偉大歌舞家的逝世，也深深地都爲他流了不少熱淚。</p>

<p>— 振華</p>
<p>誰也以爲是値得一笑的一回事，就是好萊塢的明星，每星期有五千金元的薪水，而他們還不滿足，因此常常負氣的跑了，同時有一少年明星，勞勃脫楊，觀衆對於他也很愛好的，每天給他的信扎，有二個郵差給他送還不夠。但是他很滿足，每星期二百五十元的薪水，維持他的家庭生活，而每月還須付十六元二角关汽車費理。</p>

<h3 id="c186">「全班合演」的迴潮 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>花樣翻新無時或已的好萊塢，從前偶一爲之的「全班合演」ＡllＳtarＣast，現在顯有復盛的趨勢。最近米高美公司，用了許多明星合演成了大飯店一劇，（ＴheＧrandＨotel，已定明年一月一日，在本埠大光明映，作爲打泡片，）受了美國觀衆，空前的歡迎，引起了美國影片界的大改革，各公司，都感覺到未來的電影事業，非這樣不能吸動人們的心情，所以别家公司，也盡力採用這方法，攝成偉大的影片，好在這方法，米高美是沒有專利權的啊，</p>
<p>現在得的消息，是有兩家已全軍出動了，</p>
<p>狐狸公司，是正在攝着一張，呌ＳtateＦair，由惠爾羅吉士ＷillＲogers，珍妮蓋諾ＪenetＧaynor，却爾斯福雷ＣharlesＦarrell，傑美鄧ＪimmieＤunn，莎麗愛蘭ＳallyＥilers等等主演的，内中每一個碎角，都不用「無名之輩」，還用了很多資本，來作偉大的佈景和特種的服裝，丨丨大出品應有的一切，切末和形頭，</p>
<p>拍拉蒙公司，也是收集明星最多，和米高美不分軒輊，當然攝這種片子，更容易些，現在籌備了一本劇本，呌做ＴheＢigＢroadcast，差不多他們公司裏，任何著名演員，一個也沒漏網，</p>
<p>這是公認爲一種好的趨勢，美國影界，以爲這趨勢，會支配未來影片的全部傾向，這是我們影迷們，多高興知道的事啊，</p>

<p>數年前，國產影片爲小明星輩所主演者，爲數頗多，但二春任潮軍顧寳蓮陳少𡺠等，其尤著者也。惟其後因當局�</p>
<p>者不加注意，以致兒童主片，絕跡銀壇，較於舶來片之注重童星之天眞表演者，其相差殆不可道里計矣。</p>
<p>今因聯華炎「人道」，及天一之「一夜豪華」，童星串演，頗受人歡迎。於是國產影界，遂又注意其事。先有黎鏗主演之幼年中國，復有袁美雲主演之「小女伶」。今消息傳來，不圖專攝武俠片之月明公司，今亦由任彭年老關之女兒小鄔魔珠主演二片，名「她的心」與「血書」。同時顧寳蓮亦將重作鏡頭生涯，爲華光主演聲片。</p>

<p>「春風楊枊」是汪福慶個人慘淡經營下之大東金獅公司的處女作品，這部有聲片子，絲毫沒有假借外人的力量，完全是笠淸賢私私自自究成功的淸賢適來攝製的。這一點是多少値得我們注意的。</p>

<p>— 雨湘</p>
<p>看電影，雖然是一件極平常的事情，但是有許多地方，也値得我們注意的，我現在把它舉幾條在下面，以作諸位的參考，</p>
<p>㈠平日了好常看各種關於電影的報，一則可以知道新片的消息，二則可以見到人家關於新片的評論，那麽無價値的片子，就不會上當了，</p>
<p>㈡有的影戲院，可以定座的，不妨預先定座，以免臨時擁擠，</p>
<p>㈢有的影戲院，可以買長卷的，不可貪小，因爲這種長卷，遇着演好的影片，往往要作無效的，</p>
<p>㈣看電影，最好不要携帶二四歲以下的孩子，免得在演時哭起來，妨害人家，</p>
<p>㈤在未演之時，最好先把說明書，看一遍，可以知道，所演的影片大槪，</p>
<p>㈥在演的時候，若是二人同去的，切不可談話，或演到精彩時候拍手，因爲這種不良習慣，往往降低你的人格，尤其是在上等的影戲院，</p>
<p>㈦若是載帽子的，最好把它脫下，放在自已膝上，免得妨害人家視線，但是切不可放在座位底下的掛帽釣上，因爲常常要失竊的，</p>
<p>㈧散場時，乘黃包車，往往是很貴的，所以不妨走幾步，離開戲院稍遠地方去坐，</p>

<h3 id="c197">有吸引力的眼光 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>心雄膽壯的人，愛對别我的眼睛的瞳人裏望進去，心虚膽弱的人，却容易躱避這樣的眼光，有經騐的導演雇聘新演員的時候·在初次會面的一瞥中，就可以斷定這人能演戲與不能演戲，有經騐的醫生或是星相家一見面，就直對你的眼睛裏面一直看到你的心底裏去，然後說出他觀察的結果來，催眠術者施術的時候，他一雙有魔力的眼光，向你瞳人裏直透進光去，你的精神自然而然的就被他屈服了。</p>
<p>眼光的有力與否，與普通人尙且有很大的關係，何况我們以表現假設的情境爲職業的人呢？普通人在社交中稍有一點經騐的人，都明白眼光有訓練之必要，常常在梳沐整容的時候，有意無意的訓練他，何况我們，能夠不想方法出來朝朝暮暮的磨練嗎？</p>
<p>眼光愈練愈强，天生成的一雙有吸引力的眼光，固然是你一生最大的幸福，但是不魔練·還是不能得到稱心如意的效果，發怒的眼光，與驚慌的眼光，分别在甚麽地方？對付眞實的環境時，你自然是很熟練的，發怒有發怒的眼光，驚慌有驚慌的眼光，但是到了臨場的時候呢？美國著名的攝影師，爲著名的明星攝成的影片，尙且有時要發覺某一鏡頭的憤怒眼光，有一點兒類似恐懼的眼光，於是乎不得不要求全部演員，從新攝這一個鏡頭。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The main treaty of the Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement was signed by representatives of both sides two years ago, but there was still one issue in the appendix that the two sides did not agree on, so it has not been approved and implemented. During this visit of the French ambassador to Nanjing, several meetings were held. Given the long-standing friendship between China and France, it was agreed that the main treaty, having already been signed, should not be hindered by the appendix. The main treaty could be approved first, and then the appendix could be negotiated at length. The French ambassador has now telegraphed the government for instructions and will discuss further after receiving a reply. (Fourteenth Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Steel Mill Contract Terms Have All Been Drafted</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Jintao, Director of the Preparatory Office of the State-Owned Steel Mill, returned to Nanjing on the morning of the fourteenth. The contract for the German loan for the steel mill has been fully negotiated in Shanghai, and all the terms have been drafted. Originally, it was intended to bring it to Nanjing today for submission to the ministry for review. However, since the German representatives stipulated that the Chinese text of the contract would be the legal basis, they felt that the wording should be reviewed once more by someone proficient in Chinese to avoid future disputes. Therefore, it was changed to Monday of this week, when the German representatives, including Kang Defu and Weidingwan, will bring it to Nanjing. After Minister Chen studies it and the translation is finalized, it will be submitted to the government for approval. The content is not significantly different from what was reported in the newspapers earlier. The government hopes to sign the agreement in Nanjing on December 1st. As for the location of the Ma'anshan plant, the military and political authorities are currently using aerial surveying to determine whether it is safe from a national defense perspective. It is expected to be completed within a week, after which a decision can be made. It is also heard that the British side has inquired about the establishment of a factory in the southern section of the Jinpu Railway with German loans. If the location is in Ma'anshan, there should be no problem. Furthermore, according to German sources, German capitalists still have reservations about the steel loan, and signing the agreement on December 1st may be too late. (Fourteenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Foreign Important Telegrams</p>
<p>Hoover Opposes Cancellation of War Debts</p>
<p>Britain and France Consult the United States to Comprehensively Reorganize War Debts</p>
<p>Suspend Payment of Due Installments During Discussion Period</p>
<p>Hoover Indicates Only Conditional Reductions Can Be Made</p>
<p>▲ The National Society reported on the 13th that President Hoover had telegraphed from his special train to President-elect Roosevelt and his advisors, inviting them to jointly discuss the British and French dispatches requesting the suspension of war debt payments on Saturday. At the same time, Hoover told reporters that he personally opposed canceling war debts and believed that debt reduction must be exchanged for commercial benefits. Furthermore, the United States had previously proposed that when negotiating with debtor nations, it was not necessary to limit the discussion to war debts but should also include issues such as global economic stability and disarmament. Hoover expressed strong agreement with the British diplomatic note, which stated that the United States and other major powers were now facing a very important global problem that needed to be resolved urgently and that discussions should not be restricted. He also stated that although the war debt agreement stipulated that debtor nations should notify three months in advance if they wished to postpone payments, Germany had been accommodated previously in October, so accommodation could also be made this time. Therefore, the installments due on December 15th could be postponed, and the British and French request for renewed discussions could also be granted. There were currently no doubts, and it was expected that all debtor nations would make similar requests. Hoover also stated that the United States should accept any proposal to exchange war debts for economic benefits, but such proposals should be made by the debtor nations. The United States would offer a proposal to continue reducing military spending as part of the compensation for reducing or modifying the terms of war debts. In addition, it was reported that the United States would negotiate separately with each debtor nation, starting with the United Kingdom. Once the United Kingdom and the United States had reached an agreement, it would be easier to negotiate with other countries. It was also said that the British and French dispatches contained similar content.</p>
<p>Content of the British and French Notes</p>
<p>▲ Reuters reported from London on the 13th that the British and French official documents regarding war debts to the United States were released today. At the same time, Washington also transmitted the news that President Hoover had asked President-elect Roosevelt to discuss this issue. The British diplomatic note mentioned the agreement to cease various reparations payments in Lausanne, stating that this was the greatest contribution of the governments concerned to the early restoration of global prosperity. The United Kingdom and the United States have a similar deep interest in the restoration of prosperity, and it will not be possible to achieve this without the cooperation of the United States. The British government believes that the current state of financial obligations between governments must be reconsidered and that it is necessary to handle it quickly. The government sincerely hopes that the US government can find ways to exchange views as soon as possible, but the immediate goal of the British government is more limited. The British war debt next period expires on December 15, and the war debt issue is not one that can be agreed upon within five weeks. Therefore, the British government hopes that the same procedures previously passed in Lausanne will be implemented again, and that during the period of discussing this matter, or during the waiting period, the payment will be temporarily suspended. The British government believes that this matter should best begin in Washington, and as for other points, it will await the US government's expression of views. The French diplomatic note is roughly the same as the British diplomatic note, also requesting an extension of the Hoover suspension plan and reopening discussions on the entire war debt issue, saying that this move will have an extremely good impact on the global monetary panic. The French diplomatic note recalled the French government's automatic agreement to make major sacrifices in Lausanne and Stresa, and said that financial difficulties still hinder the restoration of international normal relations, and that new efforts must be made to break through these difficulties for the benefit of the whole. France's attitude at the two conferences in Lausanne and Stresa has proved that France sees the rapid economic recovery of Europe as being in its interest, and in this spirit, it is requesting a re-examination of the debt issue, and because the research cannot be completed in a short time, it is requested that the period of deferred payment be extended, so that the current major issue can be completed in an atmosphere of trust study.</p>
<p>▲ The National Society reported from London on the 13th that the British government sent a note to the United States last Thursday, consulting about discussing the entire structure of Anglo-American debt and requesting that payments on debts owed to the United States be temporarily suspended until the meeting is over. The full text of the long approximately seven hundred words, was published by the British Foreign Office today. The content involves asking the United States to convene a meeting with the United Kingdom to discuss debt issues in detail. However, it is not expected that the discussion will be completed before the payment date of December 15, so it is requested that the various payments due on that day be temporarily extended indefinitely. The memorandum solemnly states that world prosperity cannot be achieved until this matter is re-adjusted. Last year, President Hoover's proposal to suspend payments did not achieve the hope of realizing economic recovery. The Lausanne Agreement can be said to be the greatest contribution of the governments concerned to the early restoration of global prosperity in the international financial arena, but in order to achieve the goal, there must be cooperation from the United States. The proposal to suspend payment during the period of deliberation on this matter has been taken by the governments concerned to the United States today. As for the term limit, the memorandum has not mentioned the period in which the Anglo-American debt meeting is expected to end, and has only requested a temporary extension of payment during the meeting period or a period separately agreed upon, but it has expressed the hope that the United States will exchange views on this matter with the United Kingdom as soon as possible. It also claims that the scope of discussions at this type of meeting is so broad that an agreement cannot be reached in haste.</p>
<p>▲ The National Society reported from Washington on the 13th that the French memorandum to the United States was also released today, the content of which is briefer than that of the British memorandum, only asking the United States to continue to discuss the war debt issue and complete it in an atmosphere of mutual trust, following the precedent of the Lausanne Conference, before the resolution is reached, allowing a temporary suspension of payment. It also said that the French government's historical faith in this kind of step would help prevent the looming financial crisis in many countries. The proposals and the agreements reached in Lausanne have contributed to harmonizing international sentiment, economic recovery and the consolidation of peace. However, despite the Lausanne Agreement, the economic and financial difficulties that hinder the restoration of normalcy still exist. We must continue our efforts to eliminate them today to benefit the whole.</p>
<p>Hoover Expresses His Position</p>
<p>▲ Reuters reported from Washington on the 13th that President Hoover's attitude towards war debts has already been seen in his telegram to Roosevelt regarding the meeting at the White House next week to discuss war debts and other matters. Hoover still opposes any form of war debt cancellation, but the telegram stated that the United States could accept debtor nations not paying cash directly but giving equivalent compensation in other forms, such as opening up markets to accommodate US industrial and agricultural products. Furthermore, the substantial reduction of world armaments can reduce our burdens and dangers and is also related to the war debt issue. Hoover also said that if negotiations begin, there must be a long and detailed discussion that cannot be completed within his term of office (March 4). Negotiations will be restricted by Congress's rejection of war debt cancellation, and if Congress's attitude changes slightly, it will be changed by congressmen who follow Roosevelt as their leader. Therefore, although he is prepared to handle this issue within his power, for the welfare of the country, it must be handled with a common will. Therefore, he asked Roosevelt to call together key Democratic figures and others to jointly deliberate.</p>
<p>Borah Demands Disarmament</p>
<p>Senator Borah, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, demanded that all countries actively reform their policies, saying that if such policies continue, they will destroy civilization, and the proposal to postpone payments should be accompanied by procedural guarantees that the situation will change thereafter. Republican Senator Bingham stated that he opposed the cancellation of war debts or the permission of repeated postponements of payment. However, at the same time, important figures, for the sake of American trade interests, advocated reorganizing the debts. They believe that completely canceling war debts is unnecessary economically and impossible in practice but advocate that Congress allow the re-consideration of the setting of debt repayment agreements and extend the existing suspension period to facilitate negotiations. The Baltimore Sun stated that there are currently only two options: debt offsetting or revision. Senators should not waste words on the cancellation of debts.</p>
<p>Congressional Attitude</p>
<p>▲ Reuters reported from Washington on the 13th that Senator Walsh, who is related to the highest Democratic Council, stated today that if the war debt issue is very urgent and needs to be dealt with immediately, then a special session of Congress should be convened immediately. Senator Swanson, who will replace Senator Borah as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the American people do not want to take on the tax burden of foreigners and substitute themselves. Many indebted countries are superior to the United States in terms of industry and finance. Although responsible officials are unwilling to criticize the British and French notes, non-official circles believe that the United States cannot refuse to discuss with the two countries, but only Congress has the right to approve the extension of the debt period. Therefore, the postponement of the payment of debts due on December 15 may be a subject of debate in Congress. Congressional leaders claim that Democrats do not support the cancellation of war debts, but any reasonable proposal by Hoover and Roosevelt to postpone payments should receive a majority of support. However, if European politicians and European newspapers sing high praises in advance, recognizing that the atmosphere in the United States that allows an extension is a prelude to the cancellation of war debts in the future, it will hinder the matter.</p>
<p>▲ The National Society reported from New York on the 13th that the American International Debt Discussion Committee, a private organization, released a research report tonight, chaired by Sloan and endorsed by famous economists across the country, advocating that debtor nations be allowed to continue to postpone payments and that the entire debt issue be re-considered and adjusted. According to Sloan, this report has been directly requested by external economic experts for research, such as Smith, President of Columbia University, Bud, and Davis, who has the hope of becoming the future Secretary of State or Ambassador to the United Kingdom, all expressed their approval.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Departure Date Undetermined</p>
<p>▲ The National Society reported from Albany on the 13th that Roosevelt remained at home today and did not go out to study the British and French war debt memorandums. It is said that Roosevelt has not fully recovered after catching a cold. He will probably be able to leave home for the office tomorrow. As for whether President Hoover's telegram inviting Roosevelt to Jinjing on Saturday has been received at this time, and which advisors Roosevelt is preparing to bring with him, the entourage refused to provide information. However, according to those close to Roosevelt, if Roosevelt accepts the invitation, Davis, Smith, and Buck are likely to be among those who will accompany him. However, whether Roosevelt will accept the invitation is still uncertain at this time. Some leaders believe that the President-elect will not have political power until March 4 of next year, and the Republican Party can resolve the matter on its own, advocating refusal to go. However, others say that Hoover has sincerely invited him in his personal capacity, which cannot be refused, because supporting the government is the duty of the people, so it is hoped that the Republican and Democratic parties can temporarily share the burden.</p>
<p>British Observations</p>
<p>▲ Reuters reported from London on the 13th that it was heard that all parties in the United Kingdom recognized this British diplomatic note as the first step in extremely important negotiations and acknowledged that the results of the US election would make it difficult for President Hoover to make a quick decision. The British are certain that the proposals contained in the British diplomatic note can be accepted by American public opinion. The British government believes that once the message that the United Kingdom and the United States have opened negotiations for the final settlement of British debt and that there will be no future payments is made public, the world's trust can be stabilized and the recovery of trade can be promoted. Reuters has learned that the British and French memoranda were drafted separately and are not identical. If negotiations are opened in the future, the British government will proceed with negotiations with other debtor nations on the one hand and follow the US's separate debt talks on the other hand, fearing that this memorandum will hinder the progress of the World Economic Conference. It is understood that the British owed US$95 million to the United States as of December 15. Furthermore, the total amount due is 460 million yuan, of which 20.2 million yuan of principal has been repaid, and 115 million yuan of interest is to be paid. As for the French debt to the United States, which is due at the same time, it is more than 19 million yuan. According to Reuters's New York dispatch, the British and French consultations with the United States on war debts have aroused blunt criticism from several parties.</p>
<p>▲ Havas reported from London on the 13th that this morning, the British press commented on the British government's request to extend the Hoover moratorium plan due to the war debt case. The Times stated that there was considerable reason to hope that the British proposal would be accepted by the United States, because if the financial contracts between countries were not revised, it would not be possible to seek recovery in the world economy. The Daily Telegraph reported that there was no other solution to the war debt issue except cancellation. The newspaper also said that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain would personally go to Washington to preside over the negotiations in order to achieve the goal of cancellation. The Daily Telegraph also said that the Democratic Party will not implement its administration until four months later, and the decision on the war debt issue will therefore be delayed. As for the Chronicle, it believes that at present, neither the leaders of the Democratic Party nor the Republican Party are strongly opposed to revising the war debt repayment method. Therefore, it is feared that even if only an extension of the war debt due on December 15 is requested, it will be rejected by the US Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Japanese Delegation Decides to Adopt Positive Policy to Deal with League of Nations</p>
<p>Matsuoka Convenes Meeting of Japanese Representatives in Paris, Deciding to Submit Written Opinion to League of Nations on 18th</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu reported from Paris on the 13th that the Japanese delegation attending the Geneva League of Nations conference held a meeting at the Maison Sterling Hotel at 3:00 PM today. After Matsuoka spoke about the recent situation in Manchuria, Sugimura, Deputy Director of the League of Nations Secretariat, spoke about the internal situation of the League of Nations, and Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom Matsudaira and Minister to Czechoslovakia Hotta spoke about the situation in the United Kingdom and Northern Europe. Sawada, Director of the Japanese League of Nations Secretariat, reported on the situations in various countries reported by the ambassadors to various countries. Among them, the full-power of Matsuoka explained the recent reality in Manchuria, which moved those present. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to eliminate the important policy of procrastination. Next, the final review of the opinion was completed, and it was decided to submit the opinion to the League of Nations Secretariat on the 18th. A statement to be issued by the Matsuoka representative and his party after arriving in Geneva was drafted, and the structure of the delegation was determined. The discussion content of the council was then reviewed. The scope was too broad, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 2:00 PM on the 14th, and the meeting was adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu reported from Paris on the 13th that the Japanese delegation, based on the principle of eliminating procrastination, will unite the military and foreign affairs in order to move forward bravely without regret, and has decided to structure the delegation as follows: 1. The representative will be assisted by a secretary; 2. The representative will have three departments: participation, intelligence; and 3. The participation department will be headed by a deputy director; outside of participation, there will be a chief of staff and staff; the general affairs department will have documents, telegrams, accounting, and etiquette; 5. The participation department will establish plans, and the general affairs department will manage affairs; 6. The candidates are as follows: Minister Sato will concurrently serve as the head of the participation department; Minister of Switzerland Yada, Director of the Japanese Secretariat of the League of Nations Sawada, Minister to Czechoslovakia Hotta, Lieutenant General Tatekawa, Major General Morita, and Major Hong, Chief of Staff Sawada, Director of the Japanese Secretariat of the League of Nations, Staff Ishihara Ambassador, Lieutenant Colonel Tsuchihashi, and several consular officers and clerical officers. In addition, a representative conference will be established, with representatives Matsuoka, Nagaoka, and Sato, ambassadors Matsudaira and Yoshida, Director of the Japanese Secretariat of the League of Nations Sawada, Ito Deputy Director, Minister to Czechoslovakia Hotta, and Lieutenant General Tatekawa all joining, responsible for discussing fundamental strategies.</p>
<p>▲ Hualian News reported from Tokyo on the 14th that according to a message from the Japanese delegation in Paris received by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Matsuoka arrived in Paris on the 12th and held meetings with Sato, Nagaoka, and representatives of the army and navy for several days to discuss strategies for dealing with the League of Nations. The Japanese delegation has three internal organizations: the General Affairs Department, the Intelligence Department, and the Secretariat, each headed by a representative. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due to the results of the US election, will change its attitude towards the Hong case to negative, and the UK and France also intend to procrastinate. Japan will take advantage of this opportunity to take the most forceful stance, using withdrawal from the League of Nations to intimidate European and American countries. Japan will shift from delaying diplomacy to active offense. There are two reasons for this: one is due to the results of the US election and the war avoidance policies of the UK, US, and France; the other is that the situation in Japan is urgent, and the result of procrastination may lead to social revolution due to economic panic. It is better to cut it off and force a peace today with sufficient war preparations in order to eliminate the social unrest in Japan and the international instability of the puppet state.</p>
<p>Valera to Go to Geneva Tomorrow to Assume Chairmanship of League of Nations Administrative Council</p>

The meeting will be chaired by Valera, Chairman of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State. Valera is scheduled to go to Geneva on Wednesday. The South Irish Parliament will propose an impeachment against Valera tomorrow due to the Anglo-Irish land dispute, but because Labor MPs oppose this impeachment, the government is not in danger of defeat.</p>

<p>Special Education News Feature: A More Scientific Teaching Guidance Plan (4) Du Gang</p>
<p>㈣ Formulation of the Plan</p>
<p>From analyzing the causes of deficiencies to discovering the need for guidance, instructors can formulate specific guidance plans based on this need to improve teaching. A teaching improvement guidance plan should include the following aspects: ㈠ Providing a better material environment to facilitate student work; ㈡ Providing better teaching tools; ㈢ Indicating better learning methods; ㈣ Indicating better teaching goals; ㈤ Providing better teaching materials; ㈥ Indicating better teaching methods. Therefore, a guidance plan does not only refer to "training teachers in service," but should also include various practical and research activities, such as creating tests, compiling teaching materials, and formulating teaching methods. The entire guidance plan should be consistent with the best educational implementation methods. That is, regarding the training of in-service teachers: ㈠ The objectives, content, and methods of the training plan should be based on scientifically established facts and principles; ㈡ Teachers should be provided with rich stimuli to enable them to recognize problems on their own; ㈢ The individual differences of teachers should be recognized, and different guidance techniques should be applied. A monotonous application of a certain guidance technique, such as distributing small publications on education, holding teacher conferences, or holding individual talks, should be avoided; ㈣ Instructors should provide sympathetic assistance for problems that humans cannot avoid and should not resort to dictatorial arbitrariness; ㈤ Instructors should encourage teachers' originality, self-control, and self-evaluation. Teaching guidance is a creative endeavor, and the personality of teachers should be considered everywhere, so that teachers do not lose self-confidence.</p>
<p>㈤ Measurement of Results</p>
<p>The effectiveness of teaching guidance should undoubtedly be measured. There are already many books published on the measurement of teaching effectiveness, but the measurement of teaching effectiveness guidance has hardly been mentioned in China. However, as the teaching guidance career gradually develops, objective measurement methods for guidance effectiveness will naturally develop with it. The scope of objective measurement of teaching guidance effectiveness is nothing more than the following aspects: ㈠ Measuring the effectiveness of guidance from the changes that occur in students, such as the number of students who are promoted, demoted, or drop out of school, as well as the effectiveness of learning in various aspects, etc.; ㈡ Measuring the effectiveness of guidance from the changes that occur in teachers, such as knowledge of subject matter, educational knowledge, psychological knowledge, teaching skills, and attitudes toward teaching, etc.; ㈢ Measuring the effectiveness of guidance from the changes that occur in teaching materials, teaching tools, and other teaching material conditions. In short, there is a need for objective and clear evidence of what positive effects teaching guidance has.</p>
<p>㈥ Application of Scientific Methods</p>
<p>Scientific methods must be used in both the implementation and research aspects of teaching guidance, such as: ㈠ The teaching guidance plan must be based on the results of scientific research on teaching; ㈡ The effectiveness of teaching guidance must be measurable. The basic principles of science are nothing more than measurement, changing several aspects of the environment under certain conditions, and then measuring the results; ㈢ Maintaining an experimental attitude. An instructor with an experimental attitude will never be satisfied with the status quo. In his attempts to improve teaching, new concepts, new plans, and new methods will naturally be generated. He will not stick to old ways but will instead plan to open up new paths. He will perseveringly study the effectiveness of various new improvement methods, pay attention to the reactions of teachers and students under various training plans, diagnose their deficiencies, analyze their causes, and then modify the plans and measure their effects again. He will continue to work hard in this way until the results are satisfactory.</p>
<p>What has been described in this article is only a general outline, and deficiencies in various aspects are inevitable. If there is an opportunity, the author will propose a detailed discussion on each aspect. Readers may wonder why the author has not proposed a specific plan in this article, but the author believes that a specific teaching guidance plan is formulated in response to a certain teaching situation. The instructor must go through investigation, diagnosis, and analysis before he can start to formulate it. In other words, before the instructor starts to formulate a plan, he must have a deep understanding of the current teaching situation and be able to effectively grasp where improvement and guidance are needed. Such a plan is specific, practical, and beneficial to teaching, but it also has limitations in time and space. Understanding this, the reader can know why the author does not propose a specific plan. As for the measurement of guidance efficiency, readers may think that the author is deliberately making shocking high-level arguments, but that is not the author's intention. In the process of teaching guidance, if there is no measurement step, then all the methods and techniques in the guidance process seem to have no destination. That is, the instructor may lose all control over his work and not know whether his work is effective or to what extent it is effective. If so, guidance cannot estimate its own work, let alone improve its own work. As for the tools for this kind of measurement, on the one hand, it can be aided by teaching tests, and on the other hand, it may be possible to engage in compilation. (End)</p>

<p>Volleyball Game Fierce, Fudan Wins Soochow 3-1</p>
<p>Yesterday, Soochow played against Fudan's volleyball team at Fudan Stadium. The venue was bustling with activity. The usually quiet venue was filled with excitement. Thousands of fans were all excited, as Soochow is the champion of the East China Four University Alliance, and Fudan is the champion of the Jiangda League. The two powerhouses met, and everyone wanted to see who would win. At 3:00 PM, the two sides began to compete in the sound of a silver whistle. Soochow took the lead.</p>
<p>Soochow's strength is indeed not weak. Suddenly, at 11 to 5, the two sides switched courts. It then advanced to a score of 20 to 16. The wind was filling the building, and Soochow was about to win this game. Fudan was unwilling to show weakness and continued to fight hard. Finally, in the nick of time, it won the first game with a score of 23 to 21.</p>

<p>Basketball New Technique (3)</p>
<p>(Original by Claire Byrchy) (Translated by Zhang Guodong and Qian Yi-qin)</p>
<p>In the game, if you can control the center jump, you will gain the upper hand and benefit a lot. This is generally recognized by coaches. This Chinese tactic was passed on to Hugh McDermott, coach of Oklahoma, who confirmed the effectiveness of this method at The Big Sin Conference. The center, No. 3, pats the ball to his right, then quickly turns to his left and runs down the sideline. First, No. 2 feigns a step forward to catch the center's patted ball, but in reality, No. 5 intercepts it and immediately passes or pats it to No. 1, who is crossing the court. No. 1 continues to dribble the ball forward in the predetermined direction. No. 2 tries to turn around his defender and head towards the basket. No. 1 then passes the ball to No. 2, who catches it and lifts it up forcefully and throws it to No. 3, so that it is put into the basket.</p>

<p>Fudan Wins the Third Game Again</p>
<p>After a short break, the battlefield started again. Xie Baotang in the middle of Fudan charged left and right, greatly showing his power, making it difficult for Soochow to deal with it. He then won the third game with a score of 21 to 18, greatly boosting his power.</p>
<p>Final Success</p>
<p>After Fudan won two games, his power became even stronger. Xie, the fierce brake in the middle, Cheng Mingjue's high block on the net, and Zhang's wonderful skills were even more impressive. Zhou Zhiman's fast balls were also very effective. As a result, they won the fourth game with a score of 21 to 14, and finally won the final victory with a score of three to one. The referee was Wang Shou-zheng. The lineups of the two sides are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Fudan Team Cheng Mingjue Mei Fengqi Chen Bocai Zhang Qun-guang Wang Yinghan Cai Tiange Zhou Fu-ming Xie Baotang Zhou Zhi-man Huang Jing-can</p>
<p>▲Soochow Team Zhao Cong-xing Li Guang-kuang Chen Benli Li Yong-xi Zhao Li-chu Chen Xing Zhu Zhi-lun Su Ru-song Hu Rong-jun Zhou Bo-jia</p>
<p>West Lake Art College Volleyball Team Gets Off to a Good Start</p>
<p>&gt; Yesterday won 3-0 against Aurora, today afternoon against Fazheng</p>
<p>The Hangzhou West Lake Art College volleyball team showed its skills in Shanghai yesterday. At 12:30 noon, they played a match with Aurora University at the Aurora Stadium on Lüban Road. The West Lake Art College won easily, winning three games in a row, 21-5, 21-10, 21-8. The Aurora volleyball team was established not long ago and has only recently played practice matches with schools such as the East Asia Fazheng. The West Lake Art College has been practicing for a long time, so the strength is naturally different. Yesterday, the two wings of the Aurora front row had very good kills. The West Lake Art College has average talent, especially the center. The West Lake Art College is scheduled to play a match with Fazheng College at Dapuqiao at 2:00 PM today. The same is true for the basketball team against West Qing. The West Qing basketball team was organized and established in the winter of 1928. In that year, it joined the West Qing Youth Association League and won the乙组 basketball championship with a single success. In the following year, it was promoted to the 甲组. Since then, the basketball skills have increased with age. The organizer, Mr. Ping Bao-shan, has maintained it with great effort for five years as one day. In addition to the basic team members Dong Xiao-pei (captain), Guan Lin, Wu Shi-jie, Zheng Zhi-fang, Zhang Wen-yuan, Sha Cheng-chun, Zhang Yun-qi, Qu Xi-lin, and Jia You-liang, Zhang Fang-mei, Liu Da-wei, He De-bao, Liu Zhen-hua and others have joined the team for cooperation. The team has already made an appointment with the West Qing basketball team to hold a friendly match at the West Qing Gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road today (15th) at 7:00 PM. The team management has already issued a notice, and it is hoped that the above-mentioned players will arrive on time.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>Two or One Branch</p>
<p>A Discussion of Tan Crab Anatomy by Zhan Lu</p>
<p>"September is for round navels, October is for sharp ones." Round for what? Round for divisions. Sharp for what? Sharp for the intensification of aggression.</p>
<p>Crabs are called messengers of the Jianghu (江湖, literally "rivers and lakes," referring to the martial arts world). These are crabs in the Jianghu, not crabs in the ocean. If they were sea crabs, they would never claim to be messengers of the Jianghu but would definitely call themselves overlords of the Pacific Ocean. They would roam wildly, leading their crab children and grandchildren to search for colonies, all armed to the teeth, calling it armed immigration. The thick shell is the crab's only protection; if not an armored car, it must be a tank.</p>
<p>The two pincers are used to clamp down on world opinion, so that even if you have the opportunity to speak, the place to speak is still silent and you cannot speak. If you want to speak, you must wait until it loosens its pincers.</p>
<p>Crabs are most afraid of redification. If they wear a bright red robe in the style of Hai Rui, the crab will not survive. Crabs are very averse to spicy things and perilla, unless they are caught and eaten by people. Then they are put in a pot and cooked with perilla. After they are cooked, they are dipped in mustard-flavored minced ginger and sent into the mouths of the old men. See how long you can run rampant? Only the remaining redified shells are thrown into</p>
<h3 id="e3">Can Military Force Be Relied Upon? <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>— You Xuan</p>
<p>After the First World War, the evil flames of militarism slightly subsided, and the trend of international peace gradually intensified. However, as time passed and the wounds began to heal, international jealousy arose, followed by an increasingly fierce arms race. There was a strong sense of returning to the era of militarism's rise from the late 19th century to the early 20th century. However, the evolution of history never repeats the same model. Nevertheless, the reaction of inertia often exists, and the current prevalence of militaristic aggression is clear proof. Japan's continental policy of plundering 3,767,700 square li of our Northeast Three Provinces' land and trampling upon our 30 million compatriots is truly an unprecedented act of violence in modern history. At this time, Japan could be said to be complacent, fulfilling its long-held desire to plot against us and achieving its ambition to annex the Asian continent. Although China is very weak and lacks strong resistance and fighting capabilities, with disaster imminent, it may not be willing to endure and await slaughter. Therefore, since the Mukden Incident and the fall of Jinzhou, although our authorities have been patient and cautious, patriotic people have disregarded life and death, rising up everywhere in the Northeast. Their weapons are inferior to the enemy's, but their national spirit is enough to inspire national development and awaken the sympathy of the world. The Japanese warlords, who are obsessed with military force, claim that their methods are brilliant and that they have mobilized the primitive aggressive spirit of their people, making the whole country united. In fact, it is a warlord monopoly to plan for "Manchuria," advance north to spy on Siberia, and advance south to erode North China. The military strength will be discussed later, but in terms of finance alone, they are already struggling to make ends meet and find it difficult to continue spending such huge military expenses. Those in Japan who are slightly aware of the situation feel that their situation is dangerous. Therefore, Finance Minister Takahashi, in examining the budget for the coming year, actually cut the military's new budget requests by half (the army's new request was cut by 164 million yuan (Japanese yen), and the navy's new request was cut by 287 million yuan). The military protested, with Army Minister Araki saying:</p>
<p>"...The general public believes that the army's new request for military equipment improvement funds is used to relieve small and medium-sized industrial and commercial businesses. This is a big mistake. The army, considering the overall national strength, national defense, and financial resources, believes that it is absolutely necessary, and never thought of relieving small and medium-sized businesses. If we give in on the budget案, then all these efforts will be in vain. Now is the critical moment, how can we give up halfway? So we must not be stingy with those 500 million or 1 billion yuan. For example, a young man asks for working capital. When working, he will naturally sweat, get tired, and even get slightly injured because of the work. However, he will recover quickly. Japan will definitely not perish..."</p>
<p>Considering Japan's current national strength, is it just sweating and fatigue? It is more than just being slightly injured. Businesses are trapped in the city, farmers are trapped in the countryside, and the total national treasury revenue is only 1,333 million Japanese yen, while expenditures exceed 2,230 million Japanese yen. Among them, the army and navy expenses (including increased budgets) are:</p>
<p>Army expenses: Total budget: 447,000,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>Navy expenses: Total budget: 372,000,000 Japanese yen</p>
<p>Although these assumed figures have been repeatedly considered and carefully discussed by cabinet members, there are still fears that there will be various waves between the military and the cabinet, and between the cabinet and political parties. Saito is an ally of the navy, so no major problems may occur in the navy, but although the army temporarily expressed hesitation due to the increase of 50 million yuan, how can the warlords stop their aggressive ambitions and extravagant military spending? Since the budget for the coming year is unprecedentedly inflated, what will be the financial situation?</p>
<p>In recent years, Japan's national debt has increased dramatically. The visible financial situation for the coming year is as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ As of the end of September of this year, Japan's total national debt is 6.308 billion Japanese yen.</p>
<p>㈠ The amount of government bonds not yet issued this year is 614 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>㈠ The amount of government bonds delivered is 61 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>㈠ The amount of temporary loans is 658 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>㈠ The amount of government bonds to be issued in the coming year is at least 1 billion Japanese yen.</p>
<p>㈠ According to the current market price of the Japanese yen, the increase in foreign debt due to the low exchange rate is approximately 1.5 billion Japanese yen.</p>
<p>The total of the above six items should be over 10.1 billion. Previously, the author speculated that Japan's national debt would increase to 10 billion in two or three years, reaching one-tenth of Japan's total national wealth. If such debt increases so sharply, how can the exhausted people of Japan bear it? However, the Japanese cabinet believes that "1 billion or 5 billion should not be spared." The national struggle between China and Japan cannot be resolved in three or five years. If the Chinese people can continue to persist in this long-term, disguised war, Japan's military spending in the Northeast will inevitably increase with the years. After five, ten, or fifty years, Japan's existing national wealth will be completely scattered in smoke and bullets, and consumed on guns and knives. We recall that during the reign of Louis XIV of France, France was not strong, but its only fatal wound was its financial breakdown. Compared to the relative aspect of its national strength, the Japan of today may not exceed France at that time, and the consumption of military expenses is far greater than that of France at that time. It is also the first among the countries in the world, intending to break world peace and deliberately challenge, which is also the Germany before the war. Public justice cannot control its power, what will the iron-blooded lessons be?</p>

In addition, the Japanese army summoned self-defense forces from more than 30 villages in Liaoyang County. When the Volunteer Army passed by Qianshan Station, the self-defense forces in the area were blocked on the way. Only more than 30 people from Biguanbao and Huangshabao villages arrived.

He did not receive a reply telegram. Today, I sent two more telegrams to Liu: ㈠ I told him that I could not go due to my illness and that everything could be discussed by telegram. If there were things that were inconvenient to say in the telegram, he could order Secretary Lu, whom I sent, to come to Jinan overnight to report in person. ㈡ I told him that the Third Route Army had withdrawn its defense and that the traffic between Yexian and Jinan Yantai urgently needed to be restored.

It is also heard that the plenary session will discuss the Standing Committee system of the Central Political Council and may have to make some changes, because the Central Political Council is responsible for promoting politics, and the leaders in the council must actually take this responsibility.

How we should respond has not yet been decided, but the government received information from Tokyo on the 14th that the Japanese government strongly opposes the international committee and, based on the Covenant, opposes the participation of non-member states, and has instructed its delegation in Geneva to reject the proposal. Our Foreign Affairs Committee will convene another meeting in the next few days to discuss everything. (Special telegram on the 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The League of Nations meeting is imminent. It is heard that the Japanese side's policy is to strictly prohibit tracing back to past facts and issues of responsibility, and to focus on discussing the current facts. According to a certain important person in diplomatic circles, Japan is trying to evade discussion of past facts and responsibilities, which clearly shows its cowardice and guilty conscience. The report on the course and responsibility of the September 18th Incident has already been fairly recorded, and Japan cannot escape even if it wants to. The Sino-Japanese issue must start with the past facts and responsibilities in order to achieve a fair solution. This is a definite principle. Therefore, our delegation is bound to fight for the issue of responsibility for the Sino-Japanese dispute, and our delegation will also raise the issue of compensation claims arising from the issue of responsibility. Furthermore, Japan recognizes the rebel organization as an established fact, but it does not know that this rebel organization is purely created by Japan with military force. Once the Japanese army withdraws, this rebel organization will be destroyed immediately, so it cannot be regarded as an established fact. The Nine-Power Treaty, the Pact of Paris, and the League of Nations Covenant are all universally recognized facts and cannot be ignored. In short, this kind of unreasonable attitude of the Japanese side is just a final struggle against justice and will never be recognized by the world. (Central News Agency telegram on the 14th)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silver market had no telegraph. HSBC's listing showed that the British gold shrank by 125, and the US dollar did not change because the exchange rate had risen again the day before. Hong Kong has already risen by 25. Japanese and Western coins remained unchanged, and all others were more expensive. Internally, the British were tight and the Americans were loose. The market fluctuated slightly throughout the day. At first, the British gold stabilized, but in the end, it shrank by 125 compared to last Saturday. The US dollar was flat at first, then strengthened and weakened again, and returned to flat in the afternoon, with a unified core of 0625. However, the gold price happened to be the opposite, rising by 23 taels, so hedging was also tight. It is estimated that more than a dozen pounds of British gold were transacted. The buying and selling of gold gangs varied, and many banks did business with each other. Sassoon foreign bank was importing forward contracts, and about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan of US dollars were imported in total. Various firms mostly entered, and out of notes.

<h3 id="e27">Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Both Brisk <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The market situation yesterday showed a lack of enthusiasm on the part of the public. However, judging from the brisk external demand, banks showed considerable activity in buying and selling. Because both supply and demand were brisk, there were no unusual changes in the premium. However, given the current situation, with the impending issuance of orders regarding American rice, various needs are not as frequent or complex as in the previous weeks. Therefore, there is no possibility of a price increase.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Premium and Discount Consistent and Stable <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The early market premium for "foreign silver" was 7 mace, 0 candareens, 9 li, 6 hao, 2 si, and a half. The afternoon market improved by 1 li, 2 si, and a half, to 7 mace, 0 candareens, 9 li, and 7 hao and a half. The result was only a difference of 1 hao, 2 si, and a half. The silver discount for both the early and afternoon markets was 4 fen, an improvement of 1 fen compared to the previous day, with a slight increase of 2-3 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Cents and Copper Coins Both Stable <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Jiangnan small silver dollars were 6 mace, 1 fen, and 6.5 li in both the early and afternoon markets, a slight improvement of half a li compared to the previous day. Transactions totaled 4,500 jiao in the early market and 4,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars were 2 mace and 3 li and a half in the early market and 6 mace and 5 li in the afternoon market, an increase of about 2 li. Transactions totaled 80,000 jiao in the early market and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins slightly decreased by 1,000 cash, to 408,000 cash.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Silver Dollars Continue to Be Actively Traded <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, banks saw a slight increase in silver dollar transactions. Chinese banks received over 3.0 million in silver dollar drafts, while foreign banks received over 2.9 million. Various goods, exchange rates, taxes, and miscellaneous items totaled over 17 million. 1 million was released from warehouses. Private banks and silver firms received over 33 million in silver dollar drafts. Silver surcharges totaled over 5.4 million.

<h3 id="e31">Securities and Salt Tax Rebound Strongly by One Yuan <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>| Other types rose from six or seven jiao to one yuan |</p>
<p>| Transactions totaled over 5.7 million |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was generally not dull. The sentiment of buyers and sellers was moderate, but because there was greater market demand, sporadic investments from various parties bought in, with buying being more active than selling. As a result, all prices rebounded compared to the end of last week. However, because the sentiment of buyers was dispersed, the market seemed to favor forward transactions, with no large transactions from major players. Therefore, although prices trended upward, the momentum was quite moderate. The prices rose immediately upon opening in the morning, and then fluctuated and gradually strengthened without any major changes. As a result, compared to the previous day, the salt tax rose by 1.2 yuan, the troop reduction tax rose by over 1 yuan, and the 1929 loan also rose by about seven or eight jiao. Observing the situation in the bond market, the market sentiment remained good, and there may be a possibility of further price increases. However, based on the current environment, it seems unlikely that there will be any major changes in the short term. Forward transactions totaled over 2.8 million in both the early and late markets, totaling 5.745 million yuan. Among them, the unified salt tax accounted for over 1.2 million, and the 1929 customs loan and troop reduction tax were both around 600,000. Other transactions were relatively light. In addition, spot transactions totaled only 10,700 yuan.</p>

<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reports that the New York Stock Exchange market situation last Saturday (the 12th) did not fluctuate much. From October 22nd to 29th, the number of freight cars totaled 588,000, a decrease of 29,259 from the previous week. Due to the weekend, bulls tended to cash in profits, but because the Prohibition Law was about to be amended and wheat prices soared, the stock market was affected and did not fall. The half-day transaction volume was 888,752 shares. Looking back at the stock market last week, it was quite strong because the public felt optimistic about the election and the Prohibition Law was about to be amended. On the day after the election, stocks fell sharply, but the market's absorption power was great, so it was generally considered a constructive technical indication. As for trading, there was a significant improvement compared to before, but most investors still did not participate. Overall, the current stock market situation may continue to advance, but prudent investors should wait and see, waiting for the stock market's strength to be fully demonstrated. The Dow Jones index for the 12th is listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market is still sluggish and weak, the environment is too bad and needs to be delayed, various groups purchase very little, so people's hearts are not encouraged, and the public is watching for a decline. According to some, short sellers have prepared about 4,000 to 5,000 bales of goods for delivery, so sellers are very stable, but the Yong'an factory's bulls are also not moving. The future is not certain.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Human Label Falls Three or Four Qian <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In the previous session, the human label market opened with a decline in American cotton, and the market sentiment was dim. Prices for all months fell by two or three qian. In the second and third sessions, prices fell again at the close due to a rebound in the cotton market. As a result, prices fell by three or four qian compared to the previous day. The afternoon market was still weak, and prices for all months did not fluctuate up or down. The total trading volume for the day was 30,300 bales. It was found that Yuda sold 900 bales, Dafeng 550 bales, Suilong 600 bales, Changfeng 1,300 bales, Xiesheng 400 bales, and Tongfu 400 bales. Buyers included Shenchang 1,250 bales, Yichang 700 bales, Huachang 900 bales, Yiyu 850 bales, Dachang 700 bales, and Dafeng 950 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>| Difficult for General Yarn Factories |</p>
<p>The cotton market is gradually showing signs of hardening because prices in various producing areas are difficult to fall, and sources from all directions remain sluggish. Although the upward force of American cotton is weak, there is also a lack of downward trends. Most sellers, seeing this situation, have some hedges, and fewer new sellers are emerging, so the market tends to be tight. However, yarn sales are too dull, and factory demand is still quiet, although foreign factories occasionally purchase. Because the arrival of cotton has decreased, the trend of the cotton market is higher than that of the yarn market, making it even more difficult for yarn factories.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Zheng Label Slightly Increased <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>In the previous session, although American cotton fell, the prices of Huoji, Taicang, and Yaohua, three types of substitutes for standard cotton, were reduced by 2.5 qian. As a result, people's hearts tightened again, and prices for all months rose by 2 qian. In the second and third sessions, prices fell again due to the impact of the sluggish yarn market. As a result, prices for all months fell by 5 fen. The market situation suddenly tightened in the afternoon, rising by 5 fen to 2 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 50,600 dan. It was found that Gengfeng sold 1,100 dan and Shenyu 1,300 dan, and Taichang 900 dan. Buyers included Dachangcheng 1,900 dan, Huachang 3,300 dan, Yiyu 4,400 dan, and Yifeng 1,100 dan. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market saw a rally due to Japanese purchases, with old bulls taking the opportunity to close out positions. After the US cotton government report was released, prices fell sharply because it favored short sellers. Later, US cotton rebounded, and market sentiment improved slightly. Japanese transportation merchants remained very active during the period of weak Japanese gold. At present, Indian cotton relies entirely on Japanese merchants for support. In addition, export transactions in various regions were light. New cotton is about to flood the market, and weather conditions are generally satisfactory. Local manufacturers are buying forward cotton, but there are few inquiries from Europe. The statistics for the past week are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>

<p>▲ Shanghai South: Lately, many goods have arrived, about 40 or so. There are about 280 boats in the port. The wholesale shops in urban and rural areas are inactive, and people's sentiment has softened. Moreover, due to the relationship at the end of the small month of the lunar calendar, businesses on both sides closed and reconciled their accounts in the morning. The opening prices of all goods were short by a few cents.</p>
<p>▲ Xin Zha: Few boats arrived yesterday. The roads out of this street are limited, and stability is slightly managed. Prices did not rise or fall. Kunshan and Suzhou rice in the middle opened lower by one or two cents. Lu Yangjian did not change. The daily amount of river foot corn was about 1,500 shi.</p>

<p>| Looking Up to the Future Market |</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was no market for foreign rice. Over 3,000 bags of Ke Xian rice newly arrived. Fujianese merchants still had a keen interest, and merchants from Tianjin also began to inquire, so the market was able to hold up. There was a stronger interest in commercial Ke Xian rice, while the interest in medium-grade rice was slightly weaker. Therefore, commercial goods have rebounded by two jiao compared to the lowest market price last week, while medium-grade rice remains flat. The unified market opened with 1,200 bags of Hunan Ji Jing rice priced at 8 yuan, 7 jiao, 5 fen to 6 jiao, and 310 bags of Ji You rice priced at 9 yuan, 1 jiao to 9 yuan. There were 300 bags of Ji Yuan rice priced at 10 yuan and 5 fen to 10 yuan. There were 300 bags of Jiangxi Ji Wan priced at 8 yuan, 6 jiao, 5 fen to 6 jiao. Jiangxi Ji Wan was purchased by merchants from Tianjin, while Hunan rice was purchased by merchants from Fujian. There are 3,500 bags of Xiang rice in the market, and there are also 2,000 to 3,000 bags of goods in transit. Jiangxi rice arrives and is sold immediately, with no accumulation. Only a small number of goods in transit are being shipped. However, the interest of merchants from the north and south revived yesterday and today. In addition to the opening of the market, there are also traders who personally match customers, so the future market may be stable.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Changshu Rice Prices Plummet <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>| Highest Grade Opens at Six Yuan Five Jiao |</p>
<p>The most important commercial center in Changshu is the rice industry. The rice industry relies entirely on rural farmers. Since the bumper harvest this autumn, rice prices have been falling day by day. Although the government has repeatedly tried to provide relief, it has been in vain. Therefore, in recent days, ordinary farmers have been forced to pay rent and taxes, and have no ability to store rice. They have to transport all the rice to the market for sale. Due to the instability of bank turnover, market prices have suddenly fallen. In the past three days, the decline has reached more than one yuan. The highest grade of goods is no more than six yuan and five jiao, the middle grade is six yuan, and the low grade has fallen to below five yuan. It is learned from people in the rice industry that, given the tight money supply and the influence of the Shanghai rice market, the rice market will likely plummet. In terms of prices, it will be difficult to improve, and prices will continue to fall. Rice traders are all frowning and suffering heavy losses.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Flour Market Gradually Entering Good Territory <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>| | The Power of Major Players Holding Up the Market | |</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, the prices of foreign wheat rose by about three, four, five, or six jiao, so the sentiment for each month was active. Buying sentiment was temporarily strong, and empty positions were quickly covered. Moreover, the attitude of manufacturers was ambiguous. Although the general view was that with rice prices being very loose and unusually loose for years, flour seemed to have no reason to be exclusively strong. However, the standard situation was slightly different, and once it was held up, it felt powerful. Entering a good phase was probably due to this. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it seemed soft for a while because local small factories and factories along the Yangtze River still had listings, and people's sentiment seemed tired. However, due to the major players holding up the market and not wanting to let go, it remained stable. It is difficult to predict the market prospects because the market is no longer regular. Because urgent shipments of Australian wheat are still only three taels and five qian, this situation is not good for the future. As a result, this month rose by one fen compared to the previous weekend, December rose by 7.5 li, January-February rose by one fen, and March rose by one fen and 2.5 li. April rose by one fen and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Wheat Futures Stable Only <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally stable for all months. The prices of foreign wheat rose by about three, four, five, or six jiao, so people's sentiment was naturally stable. However, there was very little difference in the reported increase in foreign wheat futures in reality. Because there are few chips for the current standard's firmness, if it rises again, Australian wheat may tend to trap people. The current pricing is already considered possible, and the market's atmosphere is not showing excitement because of this. As a result, this month rose by one fen, March rose by one fen, and April rose by two fen. Spot wheat transactions were slightly more active, with Gaoyou wheat opening at 3 taels and 3.5 qian and Luhe wheat at 3 taels, 3 qian, and 4 fen, totaling over 800 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Chicago Wheat Surges <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Xin Feng Foreign Firm reports that Chicago wheat surged 1.875 cents last Saturday (the 12th). After the election, the Democratic Party gained power, and the Prohibition Law will be amended. Barley was reported to be up by half a cent. Short positions were rapidly covered, and Wall Street also made purchases. The transaction volume on the 10th was 20 million bushels. The closing prices for December are listed below:</p>
<p>| Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|</p>
<p>| December Futures | 45.70 | Up 1.875 |</p>
<p>| May Futures | 50.75 | 1.875 |</p>

<h3 id="e46">Sugar Market: Taitoo Sugar Continued to Open Yesterday <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable with the trend of rising margin rates. The public rate was 14 taels and 8 qian, 5 fen for grade 24 raw white sand. Three to four hundred pieces were traded. The rates were 14 taels for grade 18 medium white sand and 14 taels and 3 qian for grade 20 medium white sand. Because the new goods of China Hand are expected to be slightly loose, the market situation is better. Dutch Red grades 8, 9 and 10 remained stable as before without change. Taitoo car sugar opened yesterday: Grade B at 16 taels and 05 fen, Grade CW at 15 taels and 8 qian and a half, and Grade DY at 15 taels and 4 qian. All were flat without any rise or fall. However, Grade HX had a shortage of goods and required 15 taels and 1 qian, with no further concessions. Cotton Dutch Red opened at 11 taels, 7 qian to 8 qian. In recent days, there have been sporadic arrivals with flat transactions and a stable market situation.</p>
<p>[P Dried Longan Is Predicted to Fall After Prolonged Stagnation]</p>
<p>Dried longan has recently seen a gradual loosening of Guangdong goods, and sales have been flat. In addition, inferior goods from Hankou, Tianjin, and other places have been transported at very low prices, which has had a significant impact. Therefore, although the Hainan Yuanyu Sunshen dried longan stored in various shops in the north-south market is still firmly held, it has become a deadlock. It is inevitable that a large-scale decline will occur in the future.</p>

<p>Recently, the demand for white silk heads such as silk factory cocoon silk cloth has gradually increased, and the domestic inventory has been transported to Shanghai one after another. Yesterday morning, 140 dan of Hangshaos cocoon silk cloth was transported from Liangshanmen Station in Hangzhou. All these cocoon silk cloth are new spring cocoons.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Green Teas: Zhenmei and Xioumei Are Actively Sold <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market in Shanghai, Zhenmei and Xioumei, etc. from both the No. 3 district and the local market district were being searched by tea dealers such as Tongfu, Jinheng, Yihe, and Fushi due to demand by telegram from Morocco. More than 800 boxes were transacted in the city. The top price for Zhenmei was 55 taels, and the top price for Xioumei was 33 taels, with no rise or fall compared to before. For the first-class Zhenmei, traders only had a few negotiations, and the market was sluggish. For Gongxi green tea, the Russian Aid Association and white-collar traders are both taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the market is also very deserted.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Metal: Large Quantities of Tinplate Have Been Opened <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's metal market was mixed. Black iron sheet, due to the shortage of spot goods, opened at 400 to 500 dan, and the price was 8 taels and 5 qian. The British plate manufacturer's nailing was also 600 to 700 dan, and the market was high. Because the raw materials for the manufacturer's nailing were expensive, the price was raised. Therefore, the price of Beisi was increased from 5 taels and 4 qian and a half to 5 taels and 6 qian, but there were few spot goods. The British plate was more stable at 7.5 cents and sold for 5 taels and 9 qian and a half. There were no other rises or falls. 600 to 700 boxes of tinplate were sold in this street, and the price was 10 taels and 7 qian and a half. However, a portion of the large-scale Gengzi Indemnity goods was opened yesterday. It is estimated that more than 3,000 boxes were opened by metal shops in the North Suzhou Road area at a price of 10 taels and 5 qian. It was heard in the afternoon that the foreign company also released 2,000 to 3,000 boxes of spot goods, which made the market situation more relaxed than before. Only No. 16 and No. 18 of new lead wire were slightly traded yesterday, and few other colors were touched. In addition, bamboo joints, water cement, angle iron, and mouth iron were all traded, but there were no ups and downs in the market. As for green lead and lead sheet, the local market prices also fell due to the low fixed prices. It is heard that green lead is sold at 11 taels and 8 qian, and lead sheet is sold at 21 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e50">British White Iron: Goods Still Arriving from Tianjin <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Metal product transactions were quite bleak, because few customers were installing, and few manufacturers in this street were decorating. Therefore, the market transactions were very deserted. The standards of each city were not different because of little import and export. However, Tianjin merchants have been shipping a lot of British white iron recently (estimated 800 dans arrived yesterday), so the trend of this product is slightly more moderate than before. For example, 6 feet sold for 8 qian and 2 fen, 7 feet sold for 9 qian and 7 fen, No. 28 sold for 12 taels, No. 26 sold for 11 taels and 5 qian, and No. 24 sold for 11 taels and 4 qian. It was found that only 100 to 200 dans have been shipped in recent days. In addition, the market situation for American white iron seems better than that of British goods, because the stock is thin and few goods are arriving. Moreover, various merchants are interested, so the market situation is more stable. No. 24 sells for 14 taels and 5 qian, No. 26 and No. 28 sell for 17 taels, and No. 31 sells for 15 taels and 7 qian and a half.</p>

<h3 id="e70">The Entire Board of Directors and Supervisors of China Merchants Bureau Sworn into Office Zhu Jiajie Personally Arrived Yesterday to Give Instructions and Open a Joint Meeting General Manager Liu Hongsheng Arrived at the Bureau Yesterday to Take Up His Duties The Board of Directors of Two Departments Were Temporarily Suspended Yesterday Pending Further Action <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>After the reorganization of China Merchants Bureau was ordered, the board of directors and supervisors was officially established yesterday morning. All the directors and supervisors, as well as General Manager Liu Hongsheng, were sworn into office at 9:00 am yesterday morning in the Central Bank building at No. 2 Jiujiang Road. Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiajie personally arrived to supervise and give instructions. After the inauguration, a joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors was held immediately. Around 10:00 am, the entire group went to the bureau to take up their duties and receive various files and accounts from the Supervisory Office and the General Manager's Office. Because the results of the board of directors were not yet complete, it will be received again at a fixed time. At noon, Minister Zhu Jiajie hosted a banquet for the directors and supervisors on Fourth Road and met with reporters to formally issue a statement. The Ministry of Transportation will submit the pier loan matter to today's Central Political Committee for discussion. Mr. Sudeer, the general director of the China Business Company, issued a statement regarding the loan matter and made some explanations. Li Guojie is still under supervision. His wife visited him yesterday morning and sent him daily necessities. The details are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Establishment of the Supervisory Committee <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, the new General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC), Liu Hongsheng, along with Executive Directors Ye Zhuotang, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Shouyong, Zhang Gongquan, Du Yuesheng, Yang Ying, Directors Hu Bijian, Li Fuxun, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Rizhang (absent), Zhang Xiaolin, Hu Junzhuang, and Sheng Ping, gathered for a photograph marking the establishment of the CMSNC Board of Directors and Supervisors. (Photo by Li Zunyong)</p>
<p>Ministers and Supervisors Lu Xuepu, Chen Guangfu, Yu Qiaqing, Hu Mengjia, Qin Runqing, Rong Zongjing, Huang Jinrong (absent), Guo Shun, etc., held a swearing-in ceremony in the auditorium on the third floor of the Central Bank. Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua attended to administer the oath and deliver an address. The meeting was chaired by Minister Zhu, and the agenda was as follows: 1) Paying the highest respect to the portrait of Sun Yat-sen and the national flag; 2) The chairman respectfully reading Sun Yat-sen's will; 3) The directors and supervisors taking the oath; 4) Minister Zhu's address; 5) The directors' and supervisors' representative's response; 6) General Manager Liu's response. The ceremony lasted only half an hour, after which the first joint meeting of the directors and supervisors was held.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Oath of the Directors and Supervisors <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>All directors and supervisors raised their right hands and, led by the oath administrator, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua, took the oath: "I solemnly swear that I will strictly abide by Sun Yat-sen's will, obey party principles, abide by national laws, be loyal and diligent in my duties, and economize on expenses. I will never employ useless personnel, engage in embezzlement, or accept bribes. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment from the party."</p>
<h3 id="e73">Minister Zhu's Address <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>After the new directors and supervisors took the oath, Minister Zhu delivered an address, saying, "Distinguished directors and supervisors, General Manager Liu, today's swearing-in ceremony is of great significance for the future of the CMSNC. I have only recently taken over as Minister of Transportation at the beginning of this month, and despite the heavy workload, I have come here specifically for this matter, which concerns our country's shipping industry, to discuss future development plans with you all. The CMSNC is our country's only shipping enterprise of considerable scale. Since its establishment in the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872), it has developed thanks to government funding. However, after being transferred to commercial management, due to the control of a few individuals, its business has declined, and malpractices have become rampant, worsening year by year, day by day. After the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), interest payments were suspended, and its credit was ruined. The company's problems should have been addressed more than a decade ago. The reason for the delay is that the government still trusts commercially-run enterprises and believes that shareholders should handle and rectify the situation themselves. In addition, the adverse domestic political environment in recent years has meant that the central government has been focused on unification efforts and dealing with military and political issues, without being able to attend to this. Therefore, although the CMSNC has decayed to the extreme, the government has only adopted a supervisory policy, hoping that under strict government supervision, its business could be improved and stabilized, and then further developed. However, the supervisory system has been in place for five years now, and not only has it achieved nothing, but the company's business has collapsed like a raging tide, beyond salvation. Thinking of this, it is truly heartbreaking. The company's current debt has reached over 17.9 million yuan. One set of shares (i.e., two shipping shares and one property share) had a nominal value of 100 taels and 100 yuan, totaling 270-280 taels. Although they are now said to be worth 30 taels, in reality, no one on the market is interested in these shares anymore, except for a few people who use them for speculative trading. The true value of CMSNC shares is virtually zero. Although it is said to have 25 ships,</p>
<p>many of them are over half a century old, and some are over 20 or 30 years old. Such old and dilapidated ships are no longer suitable for use. All the warehouses and docks are also in disrepair and severely damaged. In the midst of this dilapidated situation, the company's business is on the verge of collapse, and the hope for its self-rescue has been completely extinguished. The central government believes that the company's business is related to national maritime policy and the national economy, so it has decisively decided to take it back into state ownership. In consideration of the shareholders' investment, the government will buy back the shares at 50 taels per set, based on the average market price of 30 taels, 6 mace, and 6 candareens over the past three years. In the midst of the country's financial difficulties, increasing this burden is a last resort, especially during this time of national crisis, when raising this large sum is even more difficult. The central government, prioritizing the national industry and commerce and the people's livelihood, has made this sacrifice with determination. Many state-owned enterprises in various countries incur losses, especially in the shipping industry. However, some countries still adopt state-owned policies, in order to subsidize industry and commerce and maintain the country's shipping position. Because of these special circumstances, they do not hesitate to make sacrifices. Now, the central government's adoption of the state-owned system for the CMSNC is prepared to make sacrifices in order to break the deadlock, recover rights and interests, endure the pain for a while, seek future benefits, save the crisis today, and establish a grand plan for a hundred years. In order to gather ideas and benefit from diverse perspectives, the government has appointed prominent figures from the industrial and commercial sectors to form a board of directors and supervisors, actively proceed, and jointly seek the development of China's shipping industry. You all have achieved excellent results in the industrial and commercial sectors and have a long-standing history in your respective localities. You will surely be able to unite and work hard with a spirit of great fearlessness and sacrifice, abide by your oaths, and strive for the progress of the company's affairs. The future of the nation truly depends on it."</p>
<h3 id="e74">Response from the Directors and Supervisors <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Shi Liangcai, representing the board of directors and supervisors, delivered a response, saying, "Liangcai and others have been appointed as directors and supervisors of the CMSNC and are taking office today. We appreciate Minister Zhu's instructions. We believe that the board of directors is the body responsible for managing the company's affairs, and the board of supervisors is the body responsible for overseeing the company's affairs. Both have extremely important responsibilities. Liangcai and others will abide by Minister Zhu's instructions, jointly take responsibility, and reorganize the company's affairs in order to live up to the government's intentions to improve the shipping industry."</p>

<p>General Manager Liu Hongsheng delivered a response, saying, "I, Hongsheng, have been appointed by the National Government as a director and general manager of the CMSNC. I humbly believe that I am not qualified to take on this important task. However, the CMSNC is our country's only shipping organization, with a history of over 60 years. It is currently riddled with problems and in urgent need of reorganization. I have no choice but to reluctantly take on this difficult task. Today, I am taking office in accordance with the order, and I will follow Minister Zhu's instructions. I will also abide by the instructions of the board of directors, diligently and cautiously handle matters, and strive to live up to the government's intentions to reorganize the shipping industry."</p>

<p>At 11:30 AM, the entire staff gathered in the main auditorium, where General Manager Liu Hongsheng and Executive Director Shi Liangcai gave speeches. Liu said, "Although the CMSNC is now state-owned, it was originally a commercial organization. Now that I am serving as General Manager, from now on, all matters of the company must focus on commercialization in order to gradually improve. Regarding the employment of personnel, we must consider both talent and economy as principles. I hope that those who have achieved results in the past will work together with us. This is extremely fortunate." Shi said, "The CMSNC has a long history. This time, we have come with a spirit of sacrifice, without any desire for personal gain. I hope that everyone will work hard and encourage each other to restore the CMSNC to its original position."</p>

<h3 id="e82">Zhu Jiahua's Remarks <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>After hosting a banquet for the directors and supervisors and General Manager Liu at Xinghualou yesterday at noon, Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua spoke with reporters from various newspapers at 3:00 PM, discussing the reorganization of the CMSNC and the reasons for monitoring Li Guojie, as follows: 1)</p>
<p>I came to Shanghai yesterday for the CMSNC matter and discussed the post-reorganization matters with the directors and supervisors and General Manager Liu. 2) The loan agreement signed by the CMSNC with foreign businesses this time was not submitted to the ministry for approval in advance. Even the various sectors in Shanghai were unaware of it. Therefore, after the Ministry of Transportation received the news, it telegraphed Li Guojie, asking him to send all the contracts and memoranda to the ministry for review. Li Guojie sent them on the 12th. After reviewing them, the contents were intricate and complex, and a detailed study is required to determine how to proceed. Now that the directors and supervisors and the General Manager have taken office, they should collect all the documents related to this case and then review and discuss the solutions. 3) Li Guojie also deeply regrets his mistakes this time and has voluntarily reported them. The government believes that the matter is of great importance, so it is temporarily monitoring him in order to easily clear up this case. 4) The major contract signed this time has not been approved by the ministry, so it will naturally not be recognized. 5) The loan has not yet been implemented, and whether the foreign businesses have paid a small portion of the cash needs to be clarified after a thorough investigation." When reporters from Xinsheng News Agency and others raised various questions, Zhu responded as follows: (Q) After Li Guojie is monitored, what will be done? (A) Li is currently being monitored at the home of a friend in the Chinese-controlled area. Except for not being able to go out, everything else is very free. Although this loan has not been implemented, Li's name is signed on the draft. Whether the Supervisory Office has indeed allowed Li to handle it needs to be investigated on documents other than the contract. However, the Supervisory Office is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Transportation, and Chen Fumu did not submit it to the ministry for approval. Therefore, not only is it not legal, but the case is extremely complicated. To avoid the expansion of the incident, Li Guojie is temporarily monitored. The handling of the matter will be decided after the entire contract issue is reviewed and studied. (Q) This time, four warehouses are pledged or rumored, but Li's statement refers to three warehouses. How many warehouses are there? (A) According to the contract and attachments sent to the ministry by Li Guojie on the 12th, there are four warehouses. However, because the contract is in Chinese and English, it still needs to be compared to see if they match. (Q) What is Chen Fumu's responsibility? (A) Of course, it needs to be studied. Monitoring Li Guojie is also for this purpose, but before a formal determination is made, I cannot answer. However, it is clear that the CMSNC borrowed a huge amount of 30 million in foreign debt this time without submitting it to the ministry for approval and keeping it secret, which does not comply with legal procedures. Even other businesses must report to the government for approval if they borrow tens of millions in foreign debt. (Q) What is the loss of this loan? (A) Absorbing foreign investment is originally one of the methods, but it depends on whether the rights belong to us or to the other party. The degree of conflict between this CMSNC loan and national rights is not fully known, but in terms of the construction loan, the plan is to build a large building on more than 20 acres along Sichuan Road outside Fuzhou Road. In addition to self-use, the remaining part is leased, and it is estimated that it can be repaid in 15 years, but the contract stipulates 20 years, and the right to manage the lease is in the hands of the other party, and a handling fee must be paid. Isn't it the case that at least five years' rent has been handed over to others? As for the dock loan and the ship purchase loan, they are ostensibly Sino-foreign joint operations, but in fact, the rights are in the hands of the other party, and the losses will be even greater. (Q) Is the return to state ownership due to the loan issue? (A) The motivation for returning to state ownership was unrelated to the discovery of the loan. Li cited the reasons for returning to state ownership and reorganizing the company as the fact that the CMSNC's business was extremely developed during the state-owned period, and the purchase of land gradually increased to 40 million in assets, all during this period. Since it was changed to commercial operation, it has become worse and worse, gradually entering a crisis, and it is controlled by a few people, with heavy debts and no way to reorganize it. This is a larger shipping organization in our country, and it has a great relationship with industry and commerce, so the government has decided to take it back into state ownership after several considerations. (Q) It is said that some millions of yuan have been withdrawn in advance in this loan. Has the minister heard of it? (A) It has not been found yet, but this case is definitely not that simple. (Q) What are the new plans after returning to state ownership? (A) First, eliminate the malpractices, and then set new plans. (Q) Will the government allocate funds for reorganization? (A) Of course, the government will treat state ownership the same as other state-owned enterprises, and allocate some funds first as working capital. (Q) What will happen to the shares of the Jiyu Company? (A) The shares of the Jiyu Company and the shipping shares are actually one. Therefore, the CMSNC shares are traded as a set, with a total of 8 million yuan, of which 4 million yuan are Jiyu Company shares and 4 million yuan are shipping shares. (Q) When will the repurchase of commercial shares be implemented? Is it possible for those who have shares to have no objection to the evaluation of 36 taels? (A) The repurchase of commercial shares will be implemented soon. The evaluation of 36 taels was not only discussed jointly with the business community before it was determined, but also evaluated by the exchange after combining the market prices of the three years of the Republic of China 19, 20, and 21. In fact, it is very fair. Moreover, the CMSNC has not only accumulated debts of 17 million taels in recent years, but also has not paid interest since the 11th year. Although there is still a price on the market, it is just a speculative effect, and the essence is equal to zero. In short, whether the shares are valuable or not depends on whether the interest is paid. Since the market situation in the past three years has been evaluated, it cannot be said to be unfair. (Q) What if some shareholders do not want the government to buy back the shares? (A) This matter will be studied again, and there will probably be no problem. Finally, (Q) What is the current situation of the resignation of the Director of the Postal Service? (A) I have sent a letter to Director Huang (Nai Shu) to Beijing to discuss it in order to retain him. Zhu said that after the matter was completed, he would return to Beijing on the overnight express train.</p>

<p>After taking office, General Manager Liu made the following remarks to reporters: "I, having had my humble talents erroneously selected by the National Government and appointed as a Director and General Manager of the CMSNC, ask myself if my limited abilities are truly adequate for this heavy responsibility. However, this matter relates to our nation’s shipping industry, and is of utmost importance. I cannot but strive to exhaust my meager strength. This reorganization involves making this Bureau State-owned, differing in nature from the past. In the future, major policies and all important plans regarding this Bureau will be under the authority of the Ministry of Transportation. The General Manager’s responsibility lies only in faithfully executing the plans and intentions set by the Ministry and the Board of Directors. I shall exert all my meager abilities and diligently devote myself to the task, striving to live up to the Government’s intention to develop the shipping industry. If I am fortunate enough to receive unbiased guidance and unanimous assistance from all sectors, it would not only be my personal fortune."</p>

<p>Li Guojie, the former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, borrowed money from the China General Commercial Company and the Dalae Steamship Company, pledging the docks for: 1) Construction loans, 2) Dock loans, and 3) Purchasing new ships on credit, totaling 30 million yuan. After the China General Commercial Company took over the dock loan case, Hong Dezhao, the Deputy Director of the Dock Affairs Department, went to the CMSNC yesterday afternoon to report the progress to the new General Manager, Liu Hongsheng. At 4:00 PM, the China General Commercial Company sent personnel to the CMSNC to explain the pledge process to Liu Hongsheng.</p>

<p>Mr. Suter, Director-General of the China General Edison Company, spoke to visitors yesterday regarding the loan to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, stating that the contract signed between the company and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was purely commercial in nature and was the result of three years of negotiations between the two parties. All consultations were handled by the Chairman of the Board of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, acting on behalf of the successive supervisors of the Ministry of Communications. Furthermore, as it is a purely commercial contract, both parties will benefit from it, and the future result will not only be to reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company but also to give it a solid financial foundation and place it in the position of a leading shipping company in the Far East. As for the contents of the contract, due to its commercial confidential nature, he is not yet able to disclose them. What he can state is that among the two contracting parties, his company is the only foreign company, and no other companies have participated.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Submitted to the Central Political Council <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>A telegram from the Ministry of Communications in Beijing states that although the government will inherit all debts of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company when it is converted to state ownership, the nature of these debts must be carefully examined to determine whether they are legal and whether there is any fraud. This matter must be jointly reviewed by the newly established Board of Directors and Board of Supervisors before a decision can be made. As for the matter of Li Guojie's unauthorized mortgage of the company's four warehouses for a large sum of money, which has a significant impact on sovereignty, how the government will deal with this will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting on the 15th for discussion to determine specific measures. According to central news, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company case will be submitted to the Central Political Council for discussion on the 16th. Zhu Jiahua has prepared a detailed report on this matter for presentation to the conference.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Labor Union Petitions Yesterday <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The union of workers at the five wharves of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, including all directors Yu Xianting, Xue Yinkui, Zhang Guiqing, etc., and all group leaders Wang Xinglin, Lin Sheng, etc., totaling more than 70 people, went to the head office yesterday morning at 10:00 to petition for: (1) Opposition to the mortgage of the wharves and a request to ensure the livelihood of the workers; (2) Urging the payment of outstanding wages for October. It happened to be the day the General Manager took office. By 12:00 noon, they met with General Manager Liu Hongsheng, who expressed his hope that the wharf workers would cooperate and work hard to achieve commercialization, and that the livelihood of the workers would naturally be taken into consideration. He ordered the accounting department to raise funds and find a way to pay the outstanding wages.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Situation of the Old Board of Directors <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Although the new directors and supervisors went to inspect and negotiate with the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, the handover has not yet taken place. According to the person in charge of the Board, Chairman Li has not ordered the completion of the handover. Therefore, when the new directors and supervisors came to the meeting, they were told that they were not prepared and could not hand over. The new directors and supervisors then instructed the existing staff to continue to take full responsibility. As for the surveillance of Chairman Li and the national government's purchase of shares, no opinions could be expressed in this tense situation.

<p>The Third Plenary Session Will Not Discuss the Position of Premier of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway Will Be Completed by Transferring Profits from the Zhengtai Railway</p>
<p>The Claims of the Sino-British Bank Will Not Be a Problem</p>
<p>Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday regarding the relocation of the North Railway Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency paid him a special visit. Mr. Zeng admitted that the Third Plenary Session would not discuss the position of Premier of the Executive Yuan, and that Wang Jingwei's reinstatement should not be a problem because he had not continued to resign.

<p>Mr. Zeng said that as for the issue of the Premier of the Executive Yuan at the Third Plenary Session, all the important people have agreed that the Central Government should not make any changes. Therefore, the Third Plenary Session will not propose a discussion on this issue. Wang Jingwei has not expressed any further intention to resign since the Central Government approved his request for a three-month extension of his leave. Therefore, his reinstatement should not be a problem. I recently received a telegram informing me that Mr. Wang arrived in Colombo on the 9th of this month and is expected to arrive in the Red Sea on the 17th of this month. I have not heard of him going to Geneva. If he recovers after the three-month leave, he can return to the country.</p>

<p>Regarding the issue of completing the uncompleted railway loans for the Longhai and Yuehan Railways, Mr. Zeng said that the section of the Yuehan Railway between Shaoguan and Zhuzhou is borrowing 2.45 million pounds from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund.

The section of the Longhai Railway between Tongguan and Lanzhou will not issue public bonds. It is planned to transfer the profits from the Zhengtai Railway to complete the railway. Although the amount of this money is not exactly known, it is estimated to be about 12 million yuan. At the same time, another 570,000 pounds will be borrowed from the Boxer Indemnity Fund for the purchase of materials. As for the 60 million yuan loan from France, it is currently shelved and has not been mentioned, so there has been no progress.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Sino-British Company's Claim <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency then inquired about the Sino-British Bank's claim of 12.8 million yuan from the Ministry of Railways. Mr. Zeng replied that this matter was a misunderstanding by the Sino-British Bank, which suspected that the Ministry of Railways would sell the site after the North Railway Station was relocated. The Ministry of Railways has now sent Chen Yaozu, Director of the Finance Department, to meet with the company. The result is not yet known, but it should not be a problem.</p>

<p>Nanjing Road Citizens' Association Advises the Telephone Company</p>
<h3 id="e100">Do Not Use the Means of Cutting Lines to Maintain Social Stability <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Nanjing Road Merchants' Association and the District One Citizens' Association of this port, because several shops on Nanjing Road had their telephone lines cut off by the telephone company on the 13th of this month, have sent another letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Citizens' General Association, etc., requesting assistance and directly sent a letter to the Shanghai Telephone Company, the original text of which reads: "To whom it may concern: Recently, we have received reports from our members, namely the users of your company, Samsung Factory No. 94834, Hefeng Company No. 94944, Wang Changtai No. 94798, Maoshenghe No. 94717, Changfeng No. 94683, etc., that the telephone fees of these numbers have either been paid for both autumn and winter seasons at the old price, or have not been paid while awaiting the resolution of the price increase negotiations, and all had their lines cut off by your company on November 13, making them unusable. Please help us to argue on their behalf. According to this, our association, as the representative of the majority of members, advocates that the telephone price should not be increased drastically. We have listed the reasons and sent them to your company for your reference. We have recently learned that your company completely disregards the fact that transportation services cannot arbitrarily increase prices or be suspended, and even fails to consider whether the social economy can bear it. It has actually used this kind of decisive means that is not humane, which will inevitably arouse the resentment of the majority of users and create new incidents that cannot be reversed. We believe that your company should not do this. Also, if a theft or fire occurs during this period for the users whose lines have been cut off, and the loss is unlimited due to the inability to use the telephone, who is responsible for creating a state of social unrest? Our association, as the representative body of citizens and merchants, dares to offer a sincere advice again, hoping that you will consider it carefully and immediately restore the right to use the telephone for the users whose lines have been cut off, and stop implementing this method, so as to avoid increasingly serious disputes and maintain public friendship."</p>

More than 100 people, including Ha Shaofu, Da Pusheng, Ha Decheng, Jin Xusheng, Wang Yi, Ma Dawu, Wu Yongxia, Shi Zifan, and Wang Zhizhong, gathered together, making for a grand occasion. Ma Gansheng delivered a welcoming speech, and Wang Ziqing gave a reply, hoping that those with two lings (a transliteration of a Hui word meaning knowledge) would work hard to promote religious teachings, and that a boat of Muslims (i.e., Hui people) would work hard on the five pillars of Islam: creed, prayer, fasting, almsgiving, and pilgrimage. Wang Mengyang hoped to promote religious teachings to all sectors of society to prevent the ignorant from fabricating stories and confusing right and wrong. Wang Qingyu hoped to accurately survey the Muslim population. The meeting was photographed at 2:00 p.m. and dispersed happily.</p>

<p>The North China Muslim Religious Protection Delegation submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan regarding the case of the South China Literary and Art Magazine insulting the national religion, requesting strict punishment. The approval from the Executive Yuan has now been received, stating that the petition has been received. After investigation, the words insulting Islam written by Lou Zikuang in the first volume, fourteenth issue of the South China Literary and Art Magazine should be investigated and dealt with according to law. The South China Literary and Art Magazine has complied with the central decision and ordered the cessation of publication. As for the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Zeng Zhongming, who published this manuscript, it is difficult to avoid the blame for negligence, but since it has been stated that he did not read it beforehand and has published an apology and voluntarily ceased publication, he should be exempted from discussion. In addition to instructing the Judicial Administration Department to forward the matter to the competent court and have the writer Lou Zikuang promptly dealt with according to law, you are hereby informed of this approval. The Shanghai-Guangdong air route will be postponed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Guangzhou air route, which connects Shanghai and Guangzhou, was previously consulted with the China Aviation Corporation. The location and equipment of the airfields along the way have been basically settled. The line could have been test flown in a short period of time and then officially opened to traffic. However, due to obstacles in funding and aircraft, the progress has been slightly slower. Now, the company is focusing on the Shanghai-Tianjin air route. The matter of the Qingdao airfield being occupied by the Japanese is also being handled by the Ministry of Communications, which has consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send personnel to negotiate with the Japanese side together with the Qingdao Municipal Government. The matter is expected to be resolved soon. Therefore, the company has no time to attend to this Shanghai-Guangzhou air route and will postpone it. However, the Shanghai-Tianjin line can be officially flown in the spring.</p>

<p>The General Association of the Abolish Civil War Alliance received a letter from the Bassein branch of the Overseas Chinese National Salvation Association in Burma, which reads: "In reply to your letter of October 1, and an application for membership, we respectfully learn of your hard work for the country and your new achievements. We are very happy to hear of the official establishment of this General Association. We believe that the biggest reason for the country's peril and the people's livelihood being in decline is the struggle for power and profit by warlords and bureaucrats, and the endless civil wars. The recent war between Han and Liu in Shandong and the wars between various generals in Sichuan are truly infuriating. Now that the lost territories in the Northeast have not yet been recovered, Rehe is under alarm, and Tianjin and Beijing are in danger, we have no time to resist foreign insults and save the country. Yet these warlords are fighting among themselves, harming each other like beans and stalks, with no concept of the nation. Is the flesh of the warlords edible? This General Association was born into this world to awaken the deaf and enlighten the blind, and call out from a high place to alert all directions. We hope that you will work hard to struggle, pool your wisdom and efforts, and work together to turn back the tide. Be sincere and brave, and use it as a pillar in the middle of the stream. For those warlords who are brave in civil war, they should be severely sanctioned. The future of the country may have a chance. A completed application for membership is enclosed with this letter. Please check and accept it. This is to the General Association of the Abolish Civil War Alliance."</p>

He stated that the facts recorded in the report regarding the responsibility for the incident and the establishment of the puppet state of Manchukuo not being the will of the local people could assert fairness. However, the underlying concept accommodated the established facts, leading to Chapter 10, which absolutely violated the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Pact of Paris, etc. We, for the survival of the Chinese nation and for the sake of peace for all mankind, must resolutely oppose it. Regarding what methods should be adopted to oppose it, please discuss it. After the committee members exchanged opinions, the results of the discussion were: (A) Issue a declaration to the outside world and send it by telegram to the League of Nations in Geneva. At the same time, notify various public organizations within the country with this declaration, asking them to advocate unanimously. The draft will be prepared by committee members such as Li Shirui and Shen Junru, and then reviewed and issued by the association. (B) Send a circular to all lawyers' associations, urging them to initiate donations from their colleagues in a spirit of self-rescue to vigorously assist the Northeast Volunteer Army. Lawyers should also initiate and convene local people's organizations to establish support associations for the Northeast Volunteer Army, and notify all associations of the Shanghai Lawyers Association's fundraising methods for reference.</p>
<p>(C) Proposal for the establishment of the Uniform Legal Rights Movement Committee (resolved) to elect three committee members to be responsible for the organization. Li Shirui, Shen Junru, and Liu Liumin were nominated on the spot to take charge. (D) Whether to restore the association's "Journal of Legal Studies" (resolved) to restore the original publication.

The tasks of the investigation include: ㈠ matters concerning the application of current laws; ㈡ matters concerning the ethics of lawyers and judges; ㈢ matters concerning the facilities of courts, prisons, and detention centers.

(F) The association should request the Ministry of Judicial Administration to issue a circular to all associations, stipulating that in the future, regarding lawyers' applications to inspect case files, extend deadlines, appoint substitute agents, and submit defense statements, judicial paper must comply with the format approved by the Shanghai Lawyers Association in order to standardize and avoid disputes. (Resolved) Passed. (G) Committee Member Dai Tianqiu proposed that lawyers who concurrently serve as executive lawyers in district and county courts should not be restricted to county courts affiliated with local courts. (Resolved) To submit to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for adoption and approval.

It is now learned that the Ministry of Interior has replied to the municipal government, stating: "Although there are no legal restrictions on one person being elected as an executive committee member of two trade associations, when members of the association attend the Chamber of Commerce as representatives, one person shall not represent two trade associations." It is heard that the municipal government will instruct the Bureau of Social Affairs to forward this reply to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for reference.</p>

<p>Good News for the Rectification of Huizhou Tea Industry</p>
<h3 id="e134">Joint Effort by Shanghai and Anhui Institutions <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The most famous export teas in China are the Wuyuan green tea and Qimen black tea produced in southern Anhui. The total value of China's annual tea exports is approximately 30 million taels, and the Wuyuan and Qimen black and green teas account for almost half of that amount. However, Wuyuan green tea has the disadvantage of being dyed, and its natural fragrance and color are lost. The output of Qimen black tea is small, and the price is surprisingly high, making it difficult to promote. The Construction Department of the Anhui Provincial Government considers tea to be an important product of Anhui Province and plans to improve it. It has reorganized the former National Tea Experiment Station in Qimen into the Provincial Tea Business Station, increasing funding and actively reorganizing it. Recently, it also sent a letter to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, requesting the tea inspection director, Wu Juenong, to go to Anhui to plan. It is heard that Mr. Wu has already arrived in Anhui and has formulated detailed plans. He will soon go to the Qimen Tea Station with the technical personnel in Anhui to plan the site and also go to tea-producing areas such as Qiupu, Qimen, Wuyuan, Xiuning, Shexian, and Tunxi to conduct a detailed investigation. In the future, the tea industry in southern Anhui will definitely have considerable development.</p>

<p>Chen Xinghang, 51 years old from Chongqing, used to be a leading actor at the Fujian New Stage, earning over 1,000 yuan per month. He was quite famous, which led to him being targeted by kidnappers. Last winter, on November 16th, he was kidnapped once, and later ransomed for 5,000 yuan. However, when he was about to leave the bandits' den, the bandits, hating his excessive stinginess, gouged out his eyes, rendering him blind. Unable to continue his career, he bought a boat to Shanghai and lived with a friend. Almost a year passed, and as he sat idle, his finances became depleted. Moreover, lacking relatives and friends in Shanghai, he was lonely and miserable. He conceived a desire to die. Yesterday afternoon, he went to the entrance of Ren Zhi Li on Wuchang Road, North Sichuan Road, and hanged himself with his belt. A patrolman spotted him and hired a vehicle to take him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After a doctor's examination, he was found to be unharmed. The staff at the hospital, pitying his plight, raised funds to buy him a boat ticket and sent someone to accompany him on board, so that he could return safely to his hometown.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Qiu Changsheng and Others Sued by Paternal Uncle for Encroaching on Store Property <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Changsheng, son of the deceased wealthy paint merchant Qiu Weiqing, and his nephew Qiu Qiyuan, were sued in the First Special District Court by their paternal uncle Qiu Hengcai, represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping, for encroaching on store property. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the court to summon them for questioning. The two defendants hired lawyers Wu Linkun, Li Zuyu, Tao Jiachun, and Qin Liankui to defend them. According to the plaintiff, the charges against the defendants for encroachment were divided into two parts: 1) Regarding the Dechangrun Paint Store, the store was established by Qiu Weiqing in the 20th year of the Guangxu reign by selling seven mu of ancestral farmland, which was valued at 350 yuan, as capital. Therefore, there were annual dividends. From the 15th year of the Republic of China to the 20th year, I only did not take money from the store for 16 years. Otherwise, I would take 300 or 500 yuan at the end of each year to spend the New Year at home. Now this right has been deprived by the defendants. 2) Regarding the Yitian (charitable farmland), Qiu Weiqing, because of the profits of Dechangrun, withdrew funds from the surplus and purchased 3,000 mu of Yitian in the Ben Niu area, which he donated to the clan. Now this Yitian has also been stolen and sold. But this matter is recorded in Qiu Weiqing's obituary, which the defendants cannot deny. In response, Qiu Changsheng stated that Dechangrun was established by his late father in partnership with Qiyuan's grandfather Hengde and Zhao Yulin, with a capital of 3,000 taels of silver. The plaintiff had no shared rights. As for the Yitian, he had only heard his late father say that he had purchased 120 mu and donated it to the clan's ancestral hall. Lawyers Wu and Tao then presented various written evidences to prove that the plaintiff had absolutely no relationship with Dechangrun, saying that the plaintiff had fabricated facts and brought a false accusation, requesting that the case be dismissed. The plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, requested that the account books of Dechangrun over the years be subpoenaed for investigation, which would make the source of its capital clear. As for the existence of the Yitian, he requested that Qiu Weiqing's obituary be consulted. Judge Huang then ordered that the case be adjourned to the afternoon of the 24th of this month for continued hearing, and ordered the defendants to bring the account books to the court at that time for verification.</p>
<p>Owes Too Much Money; Falsely Reports Robbery</p>

<p>Zhu Ronggui, 43 years old, from Huzhou, who lives at No. 33 Dongde'an Lane, Shanxi Road, in the Public Concession and runs a Huzhou crepe business, went to the Daxizhao police station in the French Concession at around 7 PM the night before last to report that he was robbed by four bandits who blocked his path while he was walking on the Huangpu beach in Xinkai River. He claimed that 330 silver dollars were stolen, and requested an investigation. The detective Zhou Ruzhang was immediately dispatched to investigate and found that there was no robbery. Zhu had falsely reported the robbery. He reported the situation to the head detective, who took Zhu into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Yuan Jiahong stated the facts of the case, and said that the police were prosecuting Zhu for falsely accusing public officials without specifying the offender, in accordance with Article 182 of the Criminal Law, and requested a trial. The detective Zhou Ruzhang also reported that last night, the head detective ordered him to take the defendant to the scene of the incident to investigate the robbery.

<h3 id="e143">Discarded Steam Engines; Purchased Large Amount of Electricity <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Zhanghua Woolen Textile Mill in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, has a strong capital and a large scale. It weaves various woolen fabrics with excellent quality and very low prices. The Chinese people are vying to buy them, recovering many rights and interests. Recently, the new manager Cheng Nianpeng and the factory director Tong Luqing have carefully planned and worked for improvement. The factory's power originally came from a 240-horsepower steam engine. However, because it consumed too much coal, it was not economical and the amount of energy limited expansion. Now, it has reached an agreement with the Pudong Electric Company to have electricity supplied by the company. It is reported that the price of electricity is very low, which can save a lot of expenses every month. Moreover, the company has ample power and can be expanded at any time, which is very convenient. In the future, the factory's products will be more exquisite because the motor speed is uniform, and the price will be gradually reduced because the cost is lower. This is good news for the domestic goods industry.</p>

<p>Wu Tongwei, 38 years old from Yancheng, makes a living by selling vegetables. He lives at No. 3, Defu Lane, Tangjiawan. Yesterday morning, Wu carried two baskets of vegetables to sell at the junction of the Chinese and French Concessions in Tangjiawan. At around 11 AM, a Vietnamese policeman (name translated as Da Qie, 25 years old) from No. 32, Songshan Road Police Station in the French Concession, passed by on patrol with a gun and drove Wu away. Wu argued that the place was in the Chinese Concession and that the policeman should not interfere. The Vietnamese policeman became enraged, put his gun in a shop, and took an iron pliers to beat Wu. Wu's head was severely injured and bleeding profusely. At the same time, all the vegetable stalls were outraged. Fortunately, police officer Zhang Shaowu from post No. 17, who was standing there, heard the noise and arrived. He took Wu and the Vietnamese policeman, along with the iron pliers, to the Second District Headquarters. After questioning by District Chief Jin, the Vietnamese policeman said that Wu had bitten his finger. Soon after, the Songshan Road Police Station heard the news and sent translator Fei Xiangxian and detective Xitan to the Second District. Initially, they requested that Wu Tongwei and the Vietnamese policeman be transferred to the police station. District Chief Jin sternly refused and agreed only to take the Vietnamese policeman away. The detective then issued a receipt and took the policeman away to have his injuries examined at the hospital. Wu Tongwei was also filed with the local court for a medical examination.</p>

<p>Lin Yiqin, from Ningbo, is in the hardware business. In August of this year, he obtained goods worth 65 taels of silver from Shi Ruimo of Yisheng Hardware Store at No. 994 Broadway Road. He paid with a check from Tongyuan Qianzhuang. When Shi went to collect the money, he negotiated with Lin, and Lin changed the check to a guarantee, agreeing to pay the money on the 10th of this month. However, he did not fulfill the agreement. On the 12th, at 5:30 PM, they negotiated at Tong Yuchun Teahouse at No. 508 Fujian Road. Shi arrived on time, but Lin invited more than ten people, including Wang Baodi from Nanjing, to intimidate Shi and force him to return Lin's guarantee. A dispute arose and Shi shouted for help. At this time, Chinese detectives Zheng Huaili and Chen Dabao from the Huishi Police Station were ordered to take Yao Sandu, the victim of a theft case at No. 148 North Shanxi Road, to identify and arrest the bandits. They passed by and heard the noise and went forward to inquire. Wang Baodi suddenly claimed to be a Chinese detective from the Laozha Police Station, prohibiting Zheng and others from interfering, and arrested Zheng and Chen, insisting on taking them to the police station. The two detectives refused to obey and were all taken to the Laozha Police Station. After investigation by detective Cao Qishan, it was found that Wang was not a detective from the police station, but an imposter. Wang Baodi and Lin Yiqin were arrested and sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Qian Hongye sat in court to interrogate Wang and Lin. Lawyers Fan Gang and Tang Huaiqun defended them. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the facts of the case and said that he was prosecuting them for attempted intimidation under Article 370, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and for obstructing the duties of public officials under Article 165 of the same law, requesting severe punishment. Zheng Huaili, Chen Dabao, Shi Ruimo, and Yao Sandu then filed cases, proving the behavior of the defendants. When questioned, the two defendants denied the allegations. Lin said that Shi had previously owed him 200 yuan and gave him a bad check for 60 yuan. This time, he owed Shi 65 taels, and after paying 22 taels, he still owed 43 taels. Therefore, he invited Shi to Tong Yuchun the day before yesterday to discuss a solution. He did not expect Shi to be ashamed and angry and collude with the detectives to falsely accuse him of intimidation. Judge Qian said that it was necessary to investigate the Tong Yuchun Teahouse in this case and adjourned the hearing. Lawyer Tang requested that the two defendants be released on bail, which Qian approved. Wang and Lin each posted 2,000 yuan bail and were released pending trial.</p>

It is said that Mr. Wang Junyoumei, an employee of the Dalu Newspaper, residing in Guangyuli, Gallerie Road, in the French Concession, suffered from dysentery last month, with no relief day or night. After Mr. Chen's diagnosis, he determined that it was a warm, damp toxin stagnant in the Taiyang meridian and used the method of digestion and transportation to clear the middle and separate the excess. After taking two doses of medicine, the disease was cured immediately. Mr. Chen's diagnosis and treatment truly has the effect of knowing after one dose and curing after two.

<p>Summary of the Proposed Regulations</p>
<p>1.  Employees listed in the permanent staff register, hereinafter referred to as "permanent employees," should be allowed to maintain their positions if their conduct is excellent, they are loyal to their duties, and they are indeed competent, until they have completed twenty years of service and reached the age of fifty, and thus become eligible to receive what is now called the "minimum pension." However, if there is any reason listed in the regulations, the Municipal Council may dismiss any employee before completing twenty years of service, in accordance with the remuneration stipulated in the regulations, or a portion of the pension calculated in proportion to the years of service, or other.</p>
<p>2.  Establish a Municipal Government Service Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Committee) to handle issues arising between the Municipal Council and any permanent employee.</p>
<p>3.  Any permanent employee who is accused of misconduct (the meaning of this term includes disobedience, offending superiors, and dereliction of duty) must first be investigated by the Committee before being dismissed, demoted, or have their salary deducted. However, this does not apply if the employee concerned abandons his right to request an investigation. After investigation, if the Committee believes that the employee is indeed guilty of misconduct and that the circumstances are serious enough to warrant dismissal, demotion, or salary deduction, the Municipal Council may dismiss, demote, or deduct the salary of the employee for misconduct; otherwise, it may not do so.</p>
<p>4.  Any permanent employee who voluntarily resigns before becoming eligible to receive the minimum pension (i.e., completing twenty years of service and reaching the age of fifty) in accordance with the current rules, and whose resignation is deemed by the Committee to be due to some actual or proposed major change in his position or conditions of service, and that it would be unfair in the circumstances to force the employee to accept this position or conditions without allowing him to receive a portion of the pension calculated in proportion to his years of service, shall be entitled to receive a portion of the pension calculated in proportion to his years of service.</p>
<p>5.  In addition to misconduct, the following circumstances may be considered legitimate reasons for the Municipal Council to dismiss an employee before he becomes eligible to receive the minimum pension:</p>
<p>A. Continued illness not due to the employee's own fault (Note 1).</p>
<p>B. Inability to perform duties due to an accident beyond the employee's control and not as a result of public service.</p>
<p>C. Abolishing the position, or reducing, reorganizing, or streamlining various parts or offices of municipal administration, or improving the part or office to which the employee belongs to save expenses or increase efficiency.</p>
<p>6.  If any committee of the Municipal Council recommends that the Council exercise its power to dismiss a permanent employee for any of the reasons mentioned above (Articles 5A, 5B, and 5C), the employee may request that the recommendation be submitted to the Municipal Government Service Committee for consideration before being submitted to the Board of Directors for a vote, and may submit a written opinion to the Committee. The Committee shall consider the matter in a timely manner and investigate it in the manner it deems appropriate. If oral evidence is accepted, the employee shall be given the opportunity to make a personal appeal, and the results of the investigation and consideration shall be reported to the Board of Directors. After considering the report, the Board of Directors shall be free to decide whether to accept the recommendation of the Municipal Council Committee.</p>
<p>7.  The proposed Municipal Government Service Committee may be organized in the following manner:</p>
<p>The committee members should be elected annually, with at least five and at most seven members, and should include the following:</p>
<p>Two or more members elected by the Board of Directors, but the elected members need not be limited to directors.</p>
<p>One or more senior officials recommended by the heads of various departments of the Municipal Council (to be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e178">Hút Tiao (Nonsense) <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Fó (Buddha)</p>
<p>| Ten Ways to Get Along in the World |</p>
<p>Whether it's Xipi, Erhuang, Eighteen Touches, Four Seasons Longing, Nine Tunes Eighteen Variations, if every tune harmonizes, that's Hút Tiao. The term Hút Tiao wasn't originally used this way, so I use Hút Tiao instead of harmonious tune, but that's pretty much the common usage nowadays.</p>
<p>The term Hút Tiao has been around for a long time. During the reign of Emperor Min of Jin, Shi Le arrested Wang Jun. Jun scolded, "You Hút slave, how dare you tease me, you are so ferocious and rebellious!" That was the beginning of Hút Tiao. The Hút Tiao used today is mostly harmonious but not Hút Tiao. If the Hút Tiao is not done right, you add a blind person, calling it "blind Hút Tiao," or add the word "làn" (bad), calling it "làn Hút Tiao." Mixing everything together, that's Hút Tiao; being able to get around every situation, that's Hút Tiao; doing whatever your friends ask you to do, that's also Hút Tiao. Hút Tiao is truly a wonderful art of getting along in the world.</p>
<p>When Party A is in power, I express my goodwill towards Party A, that's Hút Tiao; when Party B loses power, I express my disappointment towards Party B, that's also Hút Tiao; when Party A says something is good, I say it's truly outstanding; when Party B says something is bad, I say it's truly useless, truly a mistake. Emperor Taizong of Tang once stopped under a tree and said, "This is a good tree." Yuwen Shiji followed suit, praising it without end. The emperor said sternly, "Wei Zheng once admonished me to stay away from sycophants. I didn't know who the sycophant was, I suspected it was you but wasn't sure. Today, it's confirmed." This is Hút Tiao that was seen through. During the reign of Han Tuozhou in the Song dynasty, Zhao Shiduo echoed him. Tuozhou once toured the Southern Garden with guests, passed a mountain village, looked at the bamboo fence and thatched cottage, and said, "This is truly the atmosphere of the countryside, but it lacks the crowing of chickens and barking of dogs." Suddenly, they heard a dog barking from the thicket, and saw that it was Shiduo. Tuozhou laughed loudly. This is Hút Tiao that was not seen through.</p>
<p>Yuwen Shiji and Zhao Shiduo were both masters of Hút Tiao. Shiji was unfortunate to encounter Emperor Taizong of Tang, and thus failed. Zhao Shiduo was fortunate to encounter Han Tuozhou, so his Hút Tiao succeeded. So Hút Tiao can be fortunate or unfortunate?</p>

<p>School Scene</p>
<h3 id="e181">University Professor <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Jiā Lǐ</p>
<p>"Clang... Clang..."</p>
<p>The bell for class at a certain university in western Shanghai was ringing crisply. In the midst of this continuous bell ringing, the students taking Applied Chinese Composition filed into Classroom 63.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, the professor teaching this course, was an old man over half a century old. He was very tall and spoke in a very loud voice, but sometimes it was mixed with a "lā kuài" (patter) accent. Today, as usual, he carried his three-foot-long "stick," raised his head wearing a melon-skin cap, and straightened his chest as he slowly walked into Classroom 63.</p>
<p>The noisy voices in the classroom immediately subsided, and the students, one by one, held their breath and looked at the words written by the teacher on the blackboard, listening to the teacher criticizing the articles in the book.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>On the blackboard was written "Official Document Format, page 42, example 30." What the teacher was criticizing was, of course, this article.</p>
<p>The teacher read aloud, "The Judicial Investigation Committee's submission to the National Government, excerpt, requesting the promulgation of the Civil Code"... "Now that the Civil Code has not been promulgated, the judicial basis is the existing laws of the former Qing Dynasty, which are incomplete and inadequate. If the laws are exhausted, then the judges will use what they call 'principles' to make arbitrary judgments, which is extremely dangerous to determining the rights of the people." He paused and said, "The most important thing in reading articles is to understand their meaning. You see, this passage clearly says that the existing laws are not good, right?"</p>
<p>He then continued to read aloud, "The draft Civil Code compiled by the Law Compilation Bureau of the former Qing Dynasty selected the most essential legal principles of the civil codes of various countries, and sent personnel to investigate the customs of various provinces. It was carefully and thoroughly compiled to become this law." The teacher finished reading this section with great excitement and began to criticize it, saying:</p>
<p>"The Civil Code protects civil rights. The political systems of the former Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China are different, so the laws of the former Qing Dynasty cannot be applied to the Republic of China. You see, doesn't the opening of this submission say that the existing laws are not good? But then it's wrong, saying that the draft Civil Code selected the most essential legal principles of the civil codes of various countries, what investigation of customs, careful and thorough compilation, and so on to become this law. The existing laws are the draft Civil Code. Opposing it in the first place and then agreeing with it later, the former words don't match the latter, isn't that a big loophole?" He said all of this in one breath, paused, and moved his smiling face, like an automatic fan used in the summer, from the south side of the classroom all the way to the north side. Looking at the students, one by one sat in silence, some nodding frequently, as if to say, "The teacher's criticism is really good." Some opened their mouths and laughed, as if to say, "The teacher's criticism has made us suddenly enlightened!"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Teacher!" A student suddenly broke the silence, awakening the teacher's fantasy, and said, "Teacher, you're mistaken! The existing laws and the draft Civil Code are not the same thing. The existing laws are the existing laws, and the draft Civil Code is the draft Civil Code!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" The classroom was suddenly filled with laughter, because everyone couldn't hold it in any longer.</p>
<p>The teacher was embarrassed by this. He quickly defended himself, saying, "Even if they are two different things, what I'm criticizing is the style of writing! From the point of view of the style of writing, this article is not good after all! If you don't believe me, I'll revise it for you to see. I just need to change two words, and the style of writing will be smooth."</p>
<p>The student said, "I'm saying that the teacher has confused the facts. I didn't say that the teacher's article is not good. The teacher's article is certainly brilliant!"</p>
<p>The laughter was about to start, but they had to hold it back again, because another student spoke. He said, "Teacher, let's not worry about the facts now, it doesn't matter. Teacher, please continue to talk about the style of writing!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha!" Everyone laughed even harder!</p>
<p>"Clang... Clang..." The bell rang outside, saving the teacher's life.</p>
<p>The students stood up like a tide, squeezing out of the classroom with smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>What about the teacher? With his head lowered, his waist bent, his "stick" dragging, like a dog that has lost its home, he hurried away to the teachers' lounge! (Moved to help the Northeast Volunteers)</p>

<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Ever since Huang Tianfu discovered his wife had a lover, he decided to find a way to retaliate. How could a dignified man be a cuckold? Moreover, all the neighbors knew. Humph! This was simply a lifelong humiliation. So he thought:</p>
<p>"Yes, I must retaliate, I absolutely must retaliate. But how to retaliate? What method to use? The only way is to kill her, and kill the adulterer too. One day, when I know they are trysting, I can use the best pistol to shoot them both, one bullet through two people's chests! Ah! That bright red blood, how satisfying that would be! Of course, a man should have such ambition... But where does the best pistol come from? Buy it? Where would I get so much money? Borrow it? There's no way... Right, I can buy a knife, a sharp blade, that would be the same, and personally drawing blood would be even more satisfying! ... No, that won't do, that adulterer is a burly man, and he worships that old rogue, every rogue is skilled in martial arts, I'm not sure I can beat him. Right, this is not good, too risky, not worth risking my life for a woman. So what to do? Undoubtedly, I must retaliate. Oh, right, I can just kill my wife alone, that's no problem, surely a man can beat a woman? No, kill the woman and leave the adulterer? That would be too spineless. Besides, "to catch adulterers, catch both," killing only the woman, without evidence, wouldn't I be the one going to jail? How could that work?... But I have to retaliate! Hmm, right, I can commit suicide, without killing either the adulterer or the adulteress. After I die, others will surely know why I died, of course, someone will definitely scold her, curse her, let her be criticized by society, let her bear the stigma of infidelity until death. This way she will be ashamed and have nowhere to hide, she will never be able to face anyone. Oh! That would be more satisfying than killing her. Yes, I must commit suicide! Suicide! ... But suicide is dying myself, how terrible that is! I still have many good days to live, and many beautiful things are waiting for me, why should I commit suicide? That's such a stupid thing to do! But... yes, I can leave her, immediately tell her to leave me, sever our relationship as husband and wife, isn't that also a method of retaliation? Of course, if I abandon her, I won't be a cuckold, this way, no one will be killed, no one has to die, isn't that a perfect solution? Right, I must do this."</p>
<p>That's what Huang Tianfu finally decided. Not long after, his beloved wife, with whom he had shared a bed for many years, went to live with her lover under his own wife-selling contract. However, his children were deeply resentful and wept bitterly from then on, even though he often comforted himself with generosity.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e183">Superstitious Poison <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yixin</p>
<p>Inside a high wall, there is a new house, looking grand and beautiful from the gate. The furnishings in the hall are all dazzling, indicating that this is a wealthy family. An old woman is in the courtyard, threading a string of plain beads while murmuring "Namo Amitabha." Namo Amitabha. At this moment, two young men in Western suits walk in from outside, holding briefcases, and approach the old woman. One of the young men, holding the briefcase, says: "Old woman, we are here on behalf of the Northeast Volunteer Army to raise donations. In this cold weather, the Northeast is even colder, already a world of ice and snow. The poor Volunteer Army, in this world of ice and snow, is still working hard to kill the enemy. With such courage, we are here to raise money to prepare silk-padded coats so they won't be cold and can kill more dwarfs. Please help with a few hundred dollars."</p>
<p>(The old woman, upon hearing the young man's request for several hundred dollars, immediately glares at him and says: Humph! You have quite an appetite, does my family have that much money to help them? No, no, please go to someone else's house. Namo Amitabha, Namo Amitabha.</p>
<p>(Young man) If you don't have much, twenty dollars, ten dollars, is also fine, it doesn't matter. First, it's the old woman's patriotic zeal. Second, it's also charity, to prevent them from freezing to death, a great good deed.</p>
<p>(Old woman) Humph! I don't want to give a penny. They are constantly fighting, each seeking their own livelihood. Now they are fighting with the Japanese. Bodhisattva, may you manifest and make them all freeze to death, so there will be</p>
<p>peace and quiet, how wonderful would that be? Namo Amitabha, Namo Amitabha.</p>
<p>Another young man says: We misjudged, this tall building is actually the home of a slave to a fallen nation.</p>
<p>The old woman snorts! "Slave to a fallen nation or not, it has nothing to do with you. We have the Bodhisattva's protection, we will definitely not suffer," Namo Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, Namo Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>The young men shake their heads and walk away, saying: "You rely on the Bodhisattva," sighing, "The harm of superstition, so poisonous, is even more poisonous than poison itself."</p>
<p>As the old woman is chanting to the Bodhisattva, a monk walks in, she hurriedly stands up and says, "Master, please sit," pouring a cup of tea and handing it to the monk.</p>
<p>The monk, smiling, accepts the tea and says: "Good day to you, old lady, it's been a long time since you came to my temple, I've been thinking of you very much, so I came to visit you today."</p>
<p>(Old woman) Thank you, Master, because my daughter-in-law has gone to her parents' home, and it's been several months since she returned. These days I often have headaches, sometimes cold, sometimes hot. I wanted to go to your temple to pray to the Bodhisattva, I don't know if I will die or not?</p>
<p>(Monk) Old lady, you've been sweeping the floor and scrubbing, you must be tired. Tomorrow I will pray to the Great Emperor Bodhisattva for you and bring back some medicinal pills to swallow, you will naturally get better. Your spirit is very good, you will definitely not die, besides, you are fervently devoted to the Bodhisattva, the Bodhisattva will protect you from death.</p>
<p>(Old woman) Ha!! Laughing, she says: "Master, will I really not die? When you pray to the Bodhisattva, please also ask for me, protect me so I can live a few more years, don't forget."</p>
<p>(Monk) I won't forget, now there are many people praying to the Bodhisattva and burning incense in my temple, it's crowded every day. I want to add a rear hall, sculpt a statue of Amitabha Buddha, and build eighteen Arhats on both sides, so I came to discuss it with you, what do you think?</p>
<p>(Old woman) I've long wanted to contribute to the temple, to add a rear hall, but because I haven't had the time, it's been delayed until now. Now that you have already made a vow, that's the best, it should be expanded.</p>
<p>(Monk) I've brought the donation book, I'll leave one with you, please help the Bodhisattva.</p>
<p>(Old woman) This is my duty, come tomorrow and I will write it with you.</p>
<p>"The monk hands a donation book to the old woman."</p>
<p>The old woman looks at it and says: "How can such a thin book be enough to write for our big village? Bring a few more tomorrow. I've already calculated, Mrs. Wang's family two hundred dollars, Grandma Li's is also two hundred dollars, Mrs. Zhang's is also two hundred dollars, and the young lady is one hundred dollars, there are many who will donate several hundred dollars. I myself plan to write three hundred dollars, two hundred dollars written in my own name, and one hundred dollars written anonymously. If my son sees it, more than the other ladies, he will grumble and scold me, I'm informing you in advance."</p>
<p>(Monk) Thank you for the Madam's kindness, for such enthusiasm, most importantly the Bodhisattva will protect you, light feet and healthy hands, I'm leaving, old lady, please sit.</p>
<p>The old woman sends him to the door and says, "Master, please take care on your way."</p>

<h3 id="e184">Garbo's Childhood Realism (Continued) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Yesterday</p>
<p>I told her brother that I found it strange, or at least interesting, that Greta had achieved such fame as an actress.</p>
<p>Her brother, who was seven years older than her, was very handsome, with an endearing manner and speech. Hearing my words, he shook his head, his eyes shining with a strange light, and smiled:</p>
<p>"Yes, I think it's strange." He fiddled with a cigarette in his hand. "But I'm still not surprised. When she was little, she had a kind of magic that made you have to believe. Of course, I'm speaking from the position of her brother. But indeed, her various traits made you have to believe."</p>
<p>"But how did she happen to choose an acting career? Was it accidental, or did she have such an ambition from early on?"</p>
<p>Garbo's brother laughed.</p>
<p>"She often liked acting when she was very young. That's why I say she originally had this ambition."</p>
<p>Then we talked about various careers, about how many people relied on the encouragement of ambition to achieve success. Finally, I talked about his sister's career, and at this time, I felt a humorous sentiment.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it seems strange that she can have the reputation you said she has today, but I still think of her as my little sister; I really find it hard to believe she's a famous person. I feel like she's always been my little sister."</p>
<p>Our conversation was full of a natural sentiment, lovely gestures, and complete understanding. This was mainly because Garbo's brother—his name is Sven, Gustafsson—was a famously interesting person. He married an American woman and had traveled all over the continent, but he still wanted to travel to America.</p>
<p>But all of the above are her brother's words, her own family's words. So I decided to talk to others who knew Garbo as a child. At the house where Garbo was born and grew up, number thirty-two on Brahegatan Street, I spoke with Mrs. Emanuel Long, who remembered this girl named Garbo very well, as she lived next door.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○ ○</p>
<p>Mrs. Long is a short, plump woman, taking care of her sick husband. She lamented her circumstances, but when Garbo's name was mentioned, her light blue eyes shone with joy.</p>
<p>"Yes, I remember her very well."</p>
<p>I asked her a few questions about Garbo's childhood.</p>
<p>Mrs. Long sighed slightly, recalling the past.</p>
<p>"She was always happy, full of energy. She often played in my house, I really liked her, everyone liked her for no reason." Mrs. Long sighed.</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised by her success today, she has the talent to be an actress, because when she was young..." (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e185">Ziegfeld's Posthumous Honors <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenhua</p>
<p>Most of Hollywood's stars come from the Ziegfeld Follies, so the film industry values it very highly. The leader of the Follies, Mr. Ziegfeld, recently passed away suddenly due to a serious illness. Therefore, Eddie Cantor, Marion Miller, Mary Tristler, Dolores McQuinn, Will Rogers, Marilyn Davies, LuFanli, Billie Dumey, and many other big stars were very sad upon hearing this bad news.</p>
<p>Ziegfeld's wife, Billie Blank, was filming for RKO Pictures, and was near completion, when she suddenly received the telegram of her husband's death. She was overwhelmed with grief. At the same time, Hollywood stars, for the death of this great musical master, also shed many tears for him.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Contentment Brings No Disgrace <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenhua</p>
<p>Everyone thinks it's a laughing matter that Hollywood stars, who make five thousand dollars a week, are still not satisfied and often run away in a huff. Meanwhile, a young star, Robert Young, who is also loved by the audience, receives so many letters every day that two postmen are not enough to deliver them. But he is very content with his salary of two hundred and fifty dollars a week, which supports his family, and he still has to pay sixteen dollars and two cents a month for car expenses.</p>

<h3 id="e187">The Resurgence of "All-Star Casts" <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Hollywood, where new tricks are constantly emerging, is now showing a resurgence of the "all-star cast" format that was previously only occasionally used. Recently, MGM used many stars to co-star in the drama "Grand Hotel" (scheduled to be shown at the Grand Theater in Shanghai on January 1st next year as a big hit), which received unprecedented welcome from the American audience, leading to a major reform in the American film industry. All companies feel that the future of the film industry cannot attract people's attention without this method, so other companies are also trying their best to adopt this method to shoot great films, fortunately, MGM does not have a patent on this method.</p>
<p>The news is that two companies have already mobilized all their forces.</p>
<p>Fox is currently shooting a film called "State Fair," starring Will Rogers, Janet Gaynor, Charles Farrell, Jimmie Dunn, Sally Eilers, etc. Every minor role is not played by "unknown people," and a lot of capital is also used to create magnificent sets and special costumes, with everything that a big production should have.</p>
<p>Paramount also has the most stars, comparable to MGM, so it is easier to shoot this kind of film. They are now preparing a script called "The Big Broadcast," and almost every famous actor in their company is included.</p>
<p>This is generally recognized as a good trend. The American film industry believes that this trend will dominate the entire direction of future films. This is something our movie fans are very happy to know.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Child Stars Active on the Screen <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Jizhong</p>
<p>Several years ago, domestic films starring child stars were quite numerous, with Erchun, Ren Chaojun, Gu Baolian, Chen Shaoyu, etc., being the most notable. However, because the authorities did not pay attention to them, children's films disappeared from the silver screen. Compared to the attention paid to the naive performances of child stars in imported films, the difference is immeasurable.</p>
<p>Now, because the child stars in Lianhua's "Humanity" and Tianyi's "One Night of Luxury" are so popular, the domestic film industry is paying attention to this matter again. First, there was Li Keng starring in "Childhood China," and then Yuan Meiyun starring in "Little Actress." Now news comes that Moonbright Company, which specializes in martial arts films, is also starring two films by Ren Pengnian and Lao Guan's daughter, Xiao Wumo Zhu, named "Her Heart" and "Blood Letter." At the same time, Gu Baolian will also return to the screen, starring in a sound film for Huaguang.</p>
<p>Will child stars once again be active on the screen?</p>

<p>"Spring Breeze, Willows" is the maiden work of Wang Fuqing's personally and painstakingly managed Great East Golden Lion Company. This sound film does not borrow any external forces, and is entirely the result of Li Qingxian's private research and success. This is something that deserves our attention.</p>

<p>— Yuxiang</p>
<p>Watching movies is a very common thing, but there are many things that are worth our attention. I will list a few below for your reference.</p>
<p>1. Regularly read various reports about movies to know the news of new films and see people's reviews of new films, so you won't be fooled by worthless films.</p>
<p>2. Some theaters allow you to reserve seats, so it's best to reserve in advance to avoid temporary crowding.</p>
<p>3. Some theaters allow you to buy bulk tickets, but don't be greedy for small gains, because these bulk tickets are often invalid when good movies are playing.</p>
<p>4. It's best not to bring children under two or four years old to see a movie, to avoid them crying during the performance and disturbing others.</p>
<p>5. Before the show starts, it's best to read the synopsis to know the general plot of the movie.</p>
<p>6. When watching a movie, if two people go together, don't talk or clap your hands when the performance is exciting, because these bad habits often lower your personality, especially in high-end theaters.</p>
<p>7. If you are wearing a hat, it is best to take it off and put it on your lap to avoid obstructing other people's vision, but do not put it on the hat hook under the seat, because it is often stolen.</p>
<p>8. It is often very expensive to take a rickshaw when leaving, so it is better to walk a few steps and sit further away from the theater.</p>
<h3 id="e197">John Gilbert's Fourth Wedding <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Jianan</p>
<p>We imagine that the wedding ceremonies of Hollywood stars, who live a luxurious life, must be very extravagant and lively. But Gilbert's wedding this time—his fourth—is surprising.</p>
<p>On the evening of the wedding date, the bride, Virginia Bruce, quietly returned from the set, wiped off the greasepaint, took off her makeup, put on a black crepe dress with light sleeves, and slowly ran to a quiet hut, where she completed the marriage ceremony with Gilbert.</p>
<p>Besides the bridesmaids and Norma Shearer, there were very few other guests present. And early the next morning, the bride was busy continuing her work filming "Kongo," with no plans for a honeymoon.</p>
<p>Film Studies</p>
<h3 id="e198">Attractive Eyes <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>People with great ambition and courage like to look into the pupils of other people's eyes, while people who are timid and weak easily avoid such gazes. When experienced directors hire new actors, they can determine whether a person can act or not with just a glance at the initial meeting. Experienced doctors or astrologers, upon meeting someone, look straight into their eyes, seeing all the way into their heart, and then state the results of their observation. When hypnotists perform hypnosis, their pair of magical eyes shine straight into your pupils, and your spirit is naturally and inevitably subdued by them.</p>
<p>Whether eyes are powerful or not has a great relationship even with ordinary people, let alone those of us whose profession is to express hypothetical situations? Ordinary people with a little experience in social interaction understand the necessity of training their eyes, often intentionally or unintentionally training them when grooming, let alone us, can we not think of a way to hone them day and night?</p>
<p>The more you train your eyes, the stronger they become. A pair of naturally attractive eyes is certainly the greatest happiness in your life, but without honing, you still cannot achieve satisfactory results. What is the difference between angry eyes and panicked eyes? You are naturally very skilled at dealing with real environments; angry eyes have their own look, and panicked eyes have their own look. But what about when you're on set? American photographers, even when filming famous stars, sometimes find that the angry eyes in a certain shot look a bit like fearful eyes, and so they have to ask the entire cast to reshoot that shot.</p>
