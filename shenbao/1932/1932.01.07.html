<h3>精誠團結與國難</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>以新年循例休刋。本報與社會人士睽違今已五日。在此短短之五日中。錦</p>
<p>州竟又告陷落。東北半壁河山。至此實全部變易顏色。此爲一九三二年播送吾人耳鼓之第一聲噩耗。亦即我民族在一九三二年所遭受之第一下屠刀。</p>
<p>國難日亟。舉國人民。都憂憤徬徨。不可終朝。新政府雖告成立。而於安内攘外之根本大計。迄無事實上明白昭示。中央顯呈散漫狀態。人都存五日京兆之心理。錦州之噩耗傳來。而舉國沉寂。長此因循。我民族究將安適。吾人於萬分悲痛之餘敢舉兩點質疑。并以促起我國同胞之注意。</p>
<p>據五日行政院孫院長報告。一則曰。「目前的關鍵。就在政治會議的汪蔣胡三位主腦。要使他們能一齊入京。才可以減少困難。」再則曰「目前政治上的問題。是要三位先生一同解决。」孫院長之報告所昭示我人者。一爲新政府尙未臻於健全。另一即爲必汪蔣胡三領袖能精誠團結而後可以打破國難。奠定國基。然而今日胡漢民氏則養疴於廣州。汪精衛氏則調養於滬上。蔣介石氏更悠游於故鄕泉林。怡然自得。吾人徒聆精誠團結共赴國難之高調。而分裂之醞釀與暗潮。或且較前益烈不然國難至此。負有黨國之重責者。何容遠離京都。安居養病。更何容高蹈遠引。悠游鳴高國脈民命。今已僅存一線。今日究應以誠摯之熱涙。洗盡舊日之蒂介。以堅固之團結。共赴當前之國難。抑仍北轍南轅。爭持不輟。坐以致國亡家破。種族淪夷何去何從應知所以自擇知所以自處。故領袖諸公在今日。不空互存疑忌之心理尤不應作靜候時機再作雄圖之打算。假如國難至此。猶不能促進我國内之團結而反增多分裂之危機。則國家前途。殆眞永無旦時。吾人於黨政領袖今日而仍不能精誠團結共赴國難深致憂疑。而不得不疾聲呼籲者一</p>
<p>次之遼吉兩省。失之張朝。吾人固尙可諉謂禍機驟發。先無準備。此次日軍攻錦。早有宣傳。强宼當前。尤應嚴密戒備。馬占山以絶塞孤軍。扼守危城。苦鬥逾旬。龍江始陷。東北擁有二十餘萬士兵。而錦州重鎭竟輕意令暴軍長驅而入如非由於早先無充分之準備。即由於終始無堅守之决心。若謂軍隊不敷分配。則錦州駐軍僅有三旅。而關内則大軍。屯集。按甲不動若謂彈盡無以接濟。則錦州並無若何之鏖戰。而關内大軍則更終始無出動援救之準備。吾人但聞東北政治分會準備成立之消息。暴軍之應如何抗拒則終始未聞有一具體方案之昭示。而同時文電宣傳。尤顯然對國内有另一種形勢醞釀之準備此一現象。最足痛心吾人認爲國難至此。二十年來軍權擴張。分崩離析之惡因。今日實穫其惡果今後軍人亟應沉痛悔禍。澈底自新。須裁抑割據稱雄之野心。促成統一和平之局面。槍口須一律向外。武力須眞爲衛國。若强宼當前而分裂日顯。各聯朋與。儼然對峙則一旦巢覆巢傾。誰能獨存。國家淪亡。割據之局。寗能獨保。此爲吾人對於今日之軍人之尙未能决心對外。深致憂疑而不得不疾聲呼籲者二。</p>

<h3>綁案在滬破獲</h3>
<p>誤認學徒爲小主</p>
<p>被綁後備受驚恐</p>
<p>在太湖拒驚兎脫</p>
<p>死匪壓肉票身上</p>
<p>巿公安局水巡隊長警於前日（五日）上午十二時許、在南巿毛家弄浦面、截獲匪船一艘、當塲擒獲票匪六名、並救出肉票一口、茲將詳情錄次、</p>
<p>誤綁學徒　距離蘇州六十里相近之望亭新安地方、有一大規模之南貨號焉、店主　燧初、店號即名鄒順泰、平日營業頗稱發達、上年十二月二十九日晚間九時許、該號正在打烊之際突來綁匪五六人、執槍闖入店堂嚇禁聲張、聲稱須面見該號小主人談話、當時闔店人等、均相顧失色、默然不發一語、匪等情急、乃開始搜尋、詎料該店有一夥友江陰人名姚琪葆者、年二十三歲、面貌頗似該店小開、衆匪遂不遑詳察、貿然將姚綁架而去、</p>
<p>太湖拒捕　匪等將姚綁去、即將其藏匿一小沙船内、向南疾航而去、翌日該船駛過洋澄湖待抵太湖附近時、不料被該處水警查見、因查見形跡可疑、正擬上前檢查時、而匪等早已覺察、竟敢開槍拒捕、水警等亦即開槍圍捕、但結果匪等因船身輕快、且駕駛純熟、故未幾因日暮昏黑、竟得兎脫、</p>
<p>來滬截獲　是役也水警方面未蒙損失、惟匪船一匪、飲彈畢命、一匪身受重創、當時餘匪忽異想天開、將格斃之匪屍壓在肉票姚琪葆身上、以資恫嚇、姚至此心膽俱裂、不敢正視、翌日匪等竟將匪屍抛入湖中、將船直駛來滬、於前日駛抵閘北太陽廟、至五日又擬直航南巿潛泊、詎是日上午十一時許、船抵南巿毛家弄浦面時、適有巿公安局水巡隊警長孟藴臣·王雲山·隊士郝家邦·張亭獻等巡船經過、暼見該船形跡可疑、當將匪船截獲、上船檢查、</p>
<p>一匪受傷　長警等初搜無着、旣在艙内發現一人、伏在衾被中呻吟、猛見有人啓艙頓現倉皇之色、且衣服上血跡殷然警等更滋疑慮、遂詳細視察、但見斯人腹部及腰部受有槍傷並在其身畔搜獲手槍一支、子彈百粒、至此警等亟將船上所有人等一齊扣留、共計七名、一齊解隊訊究、立由徐總隊長親自預審一過、始由姚琪葆供明前情、詰之傷者供名段德奎、年三十歲、海州人、略將拒捕受傷情形、供述一過、餘因傷重、供詞不淸一匪供名潘國良三十一歲淸江人、充看票人、一名曹金標三十五歲銅山人、一名董三五十七歲、鹽城人一名、楊崑山四十五歲、鹽城人、董楊二人係船户、、並稱向有在逃寳子一名、所有槍械悉被小寳子先行取去云云、徐隊長訊畢、以案譏擄人勒贖、開槍拒捕要案、當即備文一併申解司法科訊究、</p>
<h3>朝天方之回敎徒放洋期</h3>
<p>十日起程赴亞剌伯中國回敎徒赴麥加覲朝天闕、定本月十日由滬放洋、關於旅行手續、統由敎友金子雲君委托中國旅行社籌備、一切水陸行程、均已規劃就緒、各地敎友、亦皆次第到申、現距放洋期已近、亟將續訊分誌如後、</p>
<p>覲闕之原由　回敎之發源地、在亞剌伯天方國之麥加地方、有公共朝堂名曰天房亦稱天闕、按天方國、居地球之中央、而麥加聖地、又居天方之中、敎典規定、年行朝覲大禮一次、敎徒之有能力者、生平必親詣朝敬、回徒不信佛、故敎堂内不設像、今歲朝天方典禮、定在二月内舉行、我國敎徒之參加前往者、共有四十九名、其名單已見日前本報矣、</p>
<p>敎友已到齊　今回赴亞剌伯朝覲天方之回敎徒、係出於各個人之志願、故自甘肅·靑海·寗夏·等來滬者頗多、近皆陸滬抵埠多居西城回敎堂而堂、内特備宿舍、一切由敎友金子雲君招待、據聞西康方面、尙有敎友一批、因受戰事所阻、而不能南下、</p>
<p>馬福祥歡宴　各敎友抵申之後、前蒙藏院委員長馬福祥、特假座西城敎堂設宴欵待來滬之全體敎徒、爲之洗塵、席間賓主甚歡關於敎友之飲食問、題頗爲重視今次乘輪赴新加坡、船中伙食、已經與輪公司商定、歸敎友自行管理製調、與普通旅客隔别待遇、藍烟囱公司已允轉令該輪特備淸眞敎門荣之原料、上船備用矣、</p>
<p>定期往芝達　上海往麥加無直接商輪、由中國旅行社商定藍烟囱公司、先於本月十日各敎友乘阿加批亞號輪到新加坡、再於新加、坡換搭該公司之晏德洛楚斯號輪赴紅海口岸芝達、然後換乘火車到天方之麥加、初時擬請藍烟囱開直放船一次、交涉未能成功、今回各敎友自滬往亞剌伯、僅車船票價一項、需費九千兩左右、而其他用途、猶不在内也、</p>

<h3>宋子文舊宅炸彈爆裂</h3>
<p>司閣子周阿大炸去兩指</p>
<p>研究來源或係衛隊誤遺華東社、云國民政府委員宋子文寓所、原在畢勛路八十三號、兩星期以前、宋氏因故遷至祁齊路九號詎本年一月二日中午、、畢勛路空屋外花圍中、突然發現炸彈、當塲炸傷宋氏所雇司閽捕周德本之子阿大、受傷甚重、茲將詳情、分誌如後、</p>
<p>肇禍情形　據查常宋氏遷寓後、畢勛路八十三號空屋内、仍留司閽捕兩人、輪流守衛、是日中午司閽捕周德本之子阿大、因送午膳前往、時德本方在年餐、阿大、乃往圍中游玩、暼見圍中一鐵罐小兒好奇、因即抬起檢視、遂致爆裂、時德本並另一司閽尙未餐畢、聞聲以爲汽車汽缸炸毁、置之不理未幾、聞園中呼救聲、並見阿大滿身血汚、由内亂滾而出、乃知肇禍遂往施救、則阿大已受重傷、頭部及兩手受創最巨、血肉糢糊、慘不忍睹、立將傷孩車送海格路紅十字會醫院、一方報告宋子文、宋聞報後、即率領衛士、前往調查一切、並担任醫藥用費、如果不幸致命喪葬等費、亦當完全負担、旋返寓報告法捕房、捕房立派大批探捕前往調查、並將炸彈彈壳、帶回研究、</p>
<p>炸彈來源　據捕房方面謂宋氏寓所、距馬路甚遠、宋氏寓此時、戒備森嚴、非特閒人不得入内、抑且無法將物件投入、查炸彈發現地點、係在後花園内、該處四周、均爲短牆、外人跡不能至、且亦不能投擲炸彈、衡諸情理、如果匪人意欲行刺宋氏、其行動决無如此愚拙、故研究結果、炸彈來源、或係宋氏衛隊所有、、前當遷寓誤遺其中、遂爾肇此禍端也云</p>
<p>傷孩病勢　周阿太受創甚重、所幸神智尙淸、入院時之脉膊、熱度尙屬良好、惟四日病狀頗險、漸歸平穩、生命可以無碍、惟左眼因受創過甚、業已失明、兩手一已炸去一大拇指、一已炸去一小指將來雖得痊愈、惟不免成爲廢人矣、</p>

<h3>我之元旦觀</h3>
<p>— 張隣秋</p>
<p>改造民國以來。十分殷勤的元旦先生。算已惠顧二十一次了。但是年年當他老先生駕臨我們貴中國的時候。雖然也不是風調雨順國泰民安。但比今年有哀鴻遍野的哭聲。必倭奴緊逼的砲火聲。在在可使我們心驚膽戰。欲哭無涙。最近有位朋友問我今年元旦的感想。我說好有一比中國好像一個害了疾病的小主人。已經了許多能唸幾句湯頭歌訣的醫生診治不好。後來他五房的伯叔。有從外洋回來。才把他送進一爿沒有正式院長的新開醫院裏去。這位元旦先生呢。是一個極關心探問病訊的客官。這客官每次來探訊時。常詫異着。病室中除了幾個痛癢不關。嬉笑自若的看護外。祇有幾個</p>
<p>不負責的醫生在那里爭論處方。鬧得烏烟瘴氣。從未見有家屬人的踪跡。所以一見元旦先生。他們膛目相對。並沒有病情的答案。祇胡鬧了一回客來忙算了。今年小主人的病症。是九死一生。家屬亦漸漸覺察。這元旦先生重來探問的時候。他們多數正在醫院病室中做那哭泣和悲號的工作。醫生們還各執己意一味鬭氣。但是號哭和鬭氣。决不是驅逐死神的方法。最緊要的。我只希望家人快督促負責的醫生。想一個急救辦法。不致使這有爲靑年斵喪元氣。以至於死。</p>
<h3>布衣老前輩</h3>
<p>— 碧城</p>
<p>前輩老前輩。本是普通名辭。用作尊崇老輩之稱也。亦有作專門名辭者。前淸翰林院。稱三科以前爲前輩。五科。以前爲老前輩。則翰林後蜚照例之稱呼所以致敬於先進。不敢忽也。今我所云布衣老前輩。非他人。乃我師崑山胡石予先生也。自國難發生。抵制仇貨。倡用國貨。服御尤尙樸質。於是熱心之士。羣焉以布衣倡。徵求布衣之友。發揮布衣之論。披覧報章。已屢見不一見矣。此誠救時之急務。用以提警一般鮮衣華服非外國貨不御之男女時髦。庶可激起其愛國之心乎。猶記鄙人在草橋中學讀書之日。忽忽已二十年。吾師石予先生。其時早以布衣爲諸生作則。先生任事草橋中學。歷年最久。學生數千人。誰不欽重先生之布衣樸素。堅苦刻厲。今者我同學數千人。豈無願服布衣。以爲救國運動者。對於石予先生。不當稱之爲老前輩乎。先生工爲詩。尤善畫梅。畫幅所用圖章。多有鐫以布衣二字者。如「大布之衣」。「布衣學詩」。「胡布衣印」。「胡布衣詩畫」。「老布衣」。「鄕里布衣」。「在衣可終身」等語。不一而足。又有見之於所詠之詩者。如云「麥飯還祈春熟好。布衣自種木棉來」。「養生聞說宜蔬食。居儉猶慙古布衣」。「總角交今歎零落。布衣人早絶聲華」。「截將塵髮思烏帽。爛盡秋棉惜布衣」。「訓儉追思白髮親。勉爲百歲布衣人」。「衣裳疏布平生願。燈火虚窗百感侵。」。「布袍久敝江關客。一洗緇塵歲欲闌。」皆是黄當蒙先生以臘印詩寄示。時一展誦。故能記及。邇來愛國明達。多服布衣。爲救時之提倡。豈知二十年前。有執敎鞭於中等學校。早以布衣爲學生作則。自誓終身不改。如石予先生其人者。即未曾受業門下。吾知多願稱之爲布衣老前輩。先生當之亦無愧矣。</p>

<p>時代的輪子轉動着。誰也得承認電影事業的不許停留在一個與夢的誘惑中吧。你看。克拉拉鮑的熱的表演已經給全美國的觀衆以厭棄了。紅髮的女郎已經不能再銀色的圍地中帶上伊以前的榮譽之冠冕。梅蘭鄧肯在「四大天王」以後。因了人家的警告而不再願飾演任何影片裏的蕩婦的角色。也險些因「四大天王」裏一個副主角的地位而失去了伊原有的力量。你再看「黨人魂」在中國是何等的不使人厭倦。至今還到處使人聽得那簡單而雄壯的船夫曲。「西綫無戰事」的影片的觀衆比原書的讀者還要多。他的力量足使全世界各國對于他有一種戒備和畏懼。·········這様。可見影片的作風的更易　是今年的電影年鑑上最重大的一個變異。</p>
<p>然而在我國呢。古裝的時代過去了。武俠的時代過去了。神怪的時代也過去了。雖然現在是閧動了一個有聲的潮流裏。但每一個影片的中心的力量的薄弱。是無可懷疑的事。試問。你能在一個劇塲的背景裏面找出些革命的情緒來嗎。試問。你能從一雙男女的情話中間找出些環境的咒咀來麽。那萎歷的使人消極。那浮囂的使人浪漫。不過分地說一句。像過去的中國電影。看了後至多像喝了一杯糖湯。但是。今日呢。我們希望要去看一本影片像去一個炸彈。使人生更偉大些。使意義更深刻些。</p>
<p>暴日入寇。瞬已三月。而海上的電影院裏還是互相映演着那種沒有靈魂而只有享樂的影片。我實在有些不解了。我以爲在這個時候。至少我國的影片公司要一同覺悟起來。主張把「鐵血」來救國。換一句話說。便是把鐵血的精神做影片中的靈魂。</p>
<p>譬如像明星影片公司新攝的那本「鐵血靑年」一様。他所叙述的乃是一個革命的凄艷的故事。我們看他正如看見主演的胡蝶女士和鄭小秋君在丢着一個炸彈。炸破了一個黑暗之夜。</p>
<p>好。黎明時候來了。我愛我的祖國。我愛「鐵血靑年「這個影片。</p>

<h3>時人小乘</h3>
<p>— 費文寳</p>
<p>中國甘地　印之甘地。身爲革命領袖。而粗衣爄食。淡泊自甘。其人格之偉大。宜其爲舉世所崇拜。近諸靑來先生。於國曆元旦。在中社講今後之民國。所引原則。與甘地主義。多相吻合。諸氏瘦頰秃髮。演講時焦齒囅露。態度極似甘地。余因以中國甘地相謔。先生笑曰。陽貨貌似孔子。甘地乃孔子。我則陽貨耳。一座鬨堂。先生又謂孔子學說。雖相隔數千年。與甘地之主張。無形中若合符節。惜刻下經術淪亡。注意乏人。以致國本動搖。座多學者。聞氏斯言。皆喟然太息。</p>
<p>扶九律師　朱扶九大律師。自執行律務以來。營業鼎盛。門庭若巿。終朝栗六。口筆不輟。某日有湖州當事人過訪。口稱欲見扶九律師。顧其音殊刺耳不可聞。朱律師亦怫然不悅。告以下次請稱吾姓。勿稱吾名。此君頓悟湖音與滬音有。别亟謝過不遑。然余以爲元緒公乃長壽之兆。昔人若陸龜蒙李龜年。近人若袁寒雲。亦别署龜厂皆以龜爲名不稍諱。朱律師如不慊長壽者。則音聲偶同。果自不妨。殊多爭此一解耳。</p>

<h3>戎馬雙樓記（二）</h3>
<p>— 求幸福齋主人</p>
<p>第一回　絶代名倡索居懷美眷異鄕學子浪跡締奇緣</p>
<p>每一種特殊的時代裏。必有宅的特殊背景與環境又恒有此一類的特殊人物。因時代的需要。應運而興。甚或因此類極少數特殊人物一時的煊赫。眩惑得許多人都逃不掉這背景環境的濡染和支配。以致舉世滔滔。隨波逐流。全昏天黑地的　上一大交一齊跌到這時代的陷坑襄去。可是自然規律。因果分明。種什麽因得什麽果。不能永遠是個眩惑。而必須表白出一種公平明顯的裁判的。等到總結賬的那一天。是是非非各有揭曉。這這特殊的時代。卻早己成爲過去。那些煊赫過的特殊人物。也無不輕的都已消失。而一般林林總總曾跌在那渾水襄討過生活的人。便就萬刧不復都做了時代下的犧牲者了。這部小說子戎馬雙樓記。即是叙述那様一個特殊的時代。以一段尋當男女的姻緣爲經。以那個時代裏種種的背景環境和特殊人物爲緯。話到臨完。恰好這一段姻緣。結束了這個時代。而從頭到尾總賬算淸。卻又曾判明了這一個時代裏一切的因緣。并認明了這個時代所有的眞相。大意言明。這就看本書中是怎様披露。怎様展覧。離開理論面搬演故事罷。且說北京八大胡同南北各淸吟小班的花界裏。在距此兩年以前。曾由南邊來了個絶代佳人的名妓。芳名呌梁笑雲。長得石立亭亭。穠機合度。凡是嫖客中見過伊的人的。都從審美的眼光上。一致公認伊儀態萬方的花容月貌裏有三様最珍奇希罕的特色。全身皮膚。都似無　的　　寳　一雙目。也像精品的金鋼鑽石。兩個輔著欔桃小口的小酒渦兒。尤其是跡象迷離神　莫測天地間尋不出那様的珍物來作冷當的比喻。况且這三件至寳。若一様様分拆開來估量。好固然是好。卻還未算美妙到了極處。也許仍與别的美女郎所有的相同。惟有薈萃了這所有的特色在伊一身。搭配得如此停匀布置得如此齊整又一様様不拘是分開來或合　來觀察都是也不肥。也不瘦。也不大。也不小。也不厚。也不薄。也不多也不少。如初寫黄庭。恰到好處。若差　一點。便覺不稱。若再超出一點又嫌太過。那才完成一個具體的美。誰</p>
<p>也不如伊那様的全備。</p>

<p>你嫖了或被人嫖了回來，過幾天，以爲沒有病，大膽的又去和你的老婆成丈夫睡覺，好，再過個把月，你的病發了；又過些日了，你的伴侣的病也發了；再過八九個月生下一個有梅毒的孩子，梅毒從此便成了你的傳家之寳，</p>
<p>你說有的是六Ｏ六怕他什麽丨好，打十幾針斷根要費你一年的工錢，只好勉打他一兩針，果然好象是沒有病了，過了五年，六年，十年，二十年，病復發了，鼻子掉了，眼睜爛瞎了，梅菌要進便要把你變成骷髏。愛耳利亥ＰａｕｌＥｒｂｌｒｃｈ發明的Ｓｓｌｖｌｒｓｒｓｎ（即六Ｏ六）和Ｎｃｏｓａｌｖａｒｓｎ（即九一四）追不進腦榖裹去，所以也就不能做你的生力軍了你再要想逃命，必須害一塲惡厲厲的瘧疾，發很高的熱，把腦榖裏的梅菌燒死，然而你自己也是九死一生了。</p>

<p>上海故事（一）</p>
<h3>上海故事</h3>
<p>— 周容編譯</p>
<p>第一章未開埠前的上海　第一次的印象現在初到上海來旅行的人第一次所得印象就是恍惚他走進了一座歐洲的大城巿高大的房屋整齊的道路廣大的旅館與娱樂塲美　的公園與橋梁流水一般的汽車和電車櫛比林立的外國商店以及晚上的煇　燦爛的電燈光這一切都會使一個歐美的旅行者如同身歷故鄕一般所不同的就只有擁擠不堪的中國人來往在街頭站崗的印度巡捕在人叢中穿來穿去的人力車和單輸小車以及中國商店和他們的華　的各業行會與圖案式的金字招牌而已</p>
<p>上海是一個最大而最奇特的商埠世界各國的各色人民都會集此埠五方雜居好様一個世界的都會上海確是全世界的一個最可注意的城巿</p>
<p>假如有一個外國人聽說上海的法租界和英租界原來只不過是一片沙灘當時僅只有稀少的草房茅棚而現在竟然造成了繁華世界那末這個外國人一定要大吃一驚想不到八十多年竟然發展得這麽迅速上海自從一八四三年（道光二十三年）開埠以來到現在一九三二年還不過是八十八年的歷史而已</p>
<p>無稽的傳說</p>
<p>談到上海地名歷史，旣稱申江，又稱歇浦，據說是因戰國時人春申君與黄歇而得名，但是我們一考據長江下流地勢的變遷史，這種無稽的傳說，不攻自破。　　考長江下流，自蕪湖以下，江底傾斜度，忽自二萬分之一　减爲十萬分之一，即每英哩江底降低半吋，因此河底淤積逐漸增厚，不過南京鎭江之間，兩岸山勢直逼江岸，淤泥不能散佈兩岸，隨江水冲下，至江陰以下，地勢愈低兩岸又無山丘馭朿，於是泥沙淤積，衍爲平原大陸。</p>
<p>據丁文江博士的推測，長江下流的海岸線，每隔六十九年，可以擴充一哩，又據海定施丹博士的計算，每隔六十九年擴充一哩，二數頗爲相近。現在江陰離海八十哩，據兩博士的計算而論，五千年的海岸，一定在江陰，春申君與黄歇的時代，上海還是大海，可見前人對於申江，歇浦的名稱的傳聞的附會，全屬無稽之談。</p>
<p>至於上海稱滬，到有些來歷，晋永和中（約在公曆三百五十年前後），有虞潭修滬瀆壘，防禦海賊，滬字的來歷或即由滬瀆壘的簡稱而來。（未完）</p>

<h3>北四川路的素描</h3>
<p>— 秋心</p>
<p>日本的海軍陸戰隊，每五人一組地佈滿道上，踱來踱去到處尋，瞏有乘在汽車上荷繪實彈，耀武揚威的馳着，而一般靑年的國人仍是陶醉在夢裏不醒，整天同着情侣在戲院舞塲裏笑嘻嘻地談笑着，對於國土被敵人踐踏似乎不關已責的，</p>
<p>野蠻的獸兵還任意地在我領土上横衝直撞到處破壞尋隙，而我同胞却眼睜睜地看他們揚威耀武而去，</p>
<p>自命爲愛國的靑年們在舞塲裏跳得樂而忘返，有的還犧牲了一切的工作貫注在舞女身上用功，比什麽功課和救國運動還出力，影戲門口跕滿了伸手呌買票的靑年，比上前線去勇敢，</p>
<p>啊丨他們不是口口聲聲呌着救國的靑年們麽？</p>
<p>啊丨同胞們快點醒吧丨</p>

<h3>各國離婚手續的新趨勢</h3>
<p>— 禽蘭</p>
<p>今日住在西班牙境内的結婚男女倘要消滅他倆的婚姻契約和永久地脫離關係更不須再具備嚴重的理由了　掳西班牙的新憲法祇要男女雙方同意便是合法的離婚比起從前不論如何理由一槪不准離婚那末目下婚姻關係的消滅眞要簡便得多了但是終究比不上俄羅斯與墨西哥這國眞是世界上離婚容易之國至於巴黎從前怨　們一向借重這地方的法律從事離婚現在再也不許外國人享此權利至少要住過法國二年至三年方能　引她的離婚規定</p>
<p>爲要適存心離婚的羣衆們需要起見法國各州的法律均不惜再三遷就例如蘭諾州（Ｒｅｎｓ）最初爲便利離婚人計曾規定於提出離婚請求書之前先經過六個月的居住後來巴黎開始招攬離婚生意於是蘭諾便將居住期限縮短爲三個月其後鄰近名州都來搶奪這筆「好生意」離婚的手續愈趨愈簡於是蘭諾更把必要的居住期限縮爲六星期（未完）</p>

<h3>Chen Youren Formulates Specific Plan for Japan</h3>
<p>Still Needs to be Decided by the Central Political Committee</p>
<p>The diplomatic aspects that can be reported during the New Year's holiday in Nanjing are: ㈠ The Sino-Japanese dispute has become more tense after the fall of Jinzhou. The diplomatic authorities have telegraphed Geneva, asking the League of Nations to convene a meeting of the Executive Yuan before the 25th in accordance with the last meeting record, and take the most effective and severe measures against Japan. Chen Youren has also formulated a specific plan for negotiations with Japan. Because the new political policy must be decided by the Central Political Committee, and the standing committee members of the Central Political Committee, Jiang, Wang, and Hu, are not in Beijing, so it is impossible to follow up and the implementation has not been decided. ㈡ The Japanese Consul in Nanjing, Uemura, visited the new Foreign Minister, Gan Jiehou, on the 3rd, and scheduled a meeting with Chen to congratulate him on the New Year. Although it is a diplomatic etiquette, it is actually to determine the date when the Japanese Ambassador, Shigemitsu, will come to Beijing to meet with Chen to discuss the events in the Eastern Province. It is said that Chen and Yoshizawa have a very deep friendship. The diplomatic community observes that after Yoshizawa returns to China to serve as the Japanese Foreign Minister, the negotiations in the Eastern Province are expected to achieve a better resolution through Chen's personal feelings. ㈢ The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately prepared a document and lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Ambassador after receiving the telegram on the 3rd regarding the conflict between the Japanese Consul in Fuzhou and the captains and vice-captains of the Japanese warship Northward and our students. ㈣ It is said that the two countries, China and Japan, will exchange ambassadors. When verified with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it was said that the Japanese side had this intention, but we must wait until the Sino-Japanese dispute is resolved.

<h3>Chen Mingshu Sends Telegram Urging Hu, Wang, and Jiang to Enter Beijing</h3>
<p>Chen Mingshu of Nanjing telegraphed Hu Hanmin, Wang Jingwei, and Jiang Jieshi on the 5th, saying, I respectfully request Hu Weiyuan Zhantang in Hong Kong, Wang Weiyuan Jingwei in Shanghai, and Jiang Weiyuan Jieshi in Fenghua, in view of the current situation of resisting insults and seeking national unity, we should first seek the unity of the party. The unity of the party must be realized by the leaders themselves, and then the strength can be enriched and the politics can be guided. Since the completion of the First Plenary Session, the government has been established, but our important leaders are still scattered in all directions, unable to gather together, resulting in the highest guiding organs of the party and government being unable to guide and losing their center of gravity. All plans for peace and security have nowhere to turn. The whole country is in a state of皇皇, and does not know where to turn. It was originally to unite the leaders and seek unity. Now, if the obstacles to unity still exist, you have all considered the facts and distress that you could not have done otherwise. However, with the violent neighbors pressing down on the border and the country in a state of turmoil, there is no room for error. Even if you can remedy the situation after failure, the country has concerns that cannot be further deteriorated. Mingshu has been entrusted with the mission of reconciliation. From the beginning, he has been self-disciplined by not joining the government, until the day when the achievement of peace is seen, and when people are released from their responsibilities. Later, because our important leaders謙讓were not free, Zhesheng comrades accepted the burden of difficulty because of the urging from all sides, so as to bear the responsibilities together. The comrades in Beijing also督责each other in the same way. At this time, if we want to follow the志 of a 匹夫, there is nothing that can be explained privately. Knowing that a great disaster is imminent, it is not difficult to make people do what is difficult for them and make me do what is easy, and in the end, let people bear their faults and me enjoy their fame. 世法陵迟, those who move forward will濡足以败, but those who规避逡巡are considered to be virtuous. Mingshu has survived nine deaths, what is there to worry about? Following the meaning of entering the prison in Buddhism,身名 is originally like bubbles, and destruction is also not to be辞, but there is only one original ambition of驰驱, and I will礼顶敷袵 again to my important leaders to make a final plea,幸灵修之埀、昔南宋末造、國勢已凭垫隘、而在朝宰執、相率引遁、論史者至與尸位误國同譏、中國苟猶可爲、此責豈異人任、銘樞爲求領袖團結而來、非到團結果眞絶望之時、不敢言去、待至力盡能索、靖獻無路、然後奉此待罪之身以退、付諸國人論判、廉頗忍垢、尙非明心見志之時屈平遠游、必至忠竭智窮之日、披瀝肝膽、惟我重要領袖實昭鑒之、 (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Convenes Financial Reorganization Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Peiping, Zhang Xueliang yesterday convened a financial reorganization committee meeting at the Shuncheng Prince's Mansion to discuss the financial problems of the four provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The monthly income of the four provinces is approximately 5 million, including 2.75 million for Tianjin, Hebei, and Shanxi combined, 800,000 for Shanxi, 250,000 for Chahar, and 200,000 for Suiyuan, plus 1 million from central government subsidies. However, these subsidies are issued at a 60% discount, and there are still two or three months of arrears. The actual monthly income is only 4 million, while military and financial expenditures amount to 7 million per month, leaving a shortfall of 3 million. It has been decided that starting from November, all military salaries and expenses will be issued at a 60% discount, which will still leave a shortfall of 1 million. If the various armies feel the amount is insufficient, they may voluntarily reduce their size. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Sincere Unity and National Crisis</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The newspaper is resuming publication today after the customary New Year break. It has been five days since this newspaper was last in contact with the community. In these short five days, Jinzhou has fallen. The entire northeastern half of our land has changed color. This is the first piece of bad news that reached our ears in 1932. It is also the first time our nation has been struck by the butcher's knife in 1932.</p>
<p>The national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. People across the country are worried, indignant, and at a loss. Although a new government has been established, there has been no actual clear indication of the fundamental plans for internal stability and external resistance. The central government appears to be disorganized, with everyone adopting a short-sighted attitude. The bad news of Jinzhou's fall has left the country silent. If we continue in this manner, where will our nation find peace? After much grief, we dare to raise two questions, hoping to draw the attention of our compatriots:</p>
<p>According to the report by Premier Sun of the Executive Yuan on the 5th, one point was: "The current key lies in the political conference of the three leading figures, Wang, Jiang, and Hu. Only if they can all come to Beijing can the difficulties be reduced." Another point was: "The current political problem is that the three gentlemen must resolve it together." What Premier Sun's report shows us is that the new government is not yet sound, and that only when the three leaders, Wang, Jiang, and Hu, can unite sincerely can the national crisis be overcome and the foundation of the nation be laid. However, today, Hu Hanmin is resting in Guangzhou, Wang Jingwei is recuperating in Shanghai, and Chiang Kai-shek is leisurely enjoying his homeland. We only hear the high-sounding rhetoric of sincere unity to face the national crisis together, but the brewing of division and undercurrents may be even more intense than before. Otherwise, with the national crisis at this point, how can those who bear the heavy responsibility of the Party and the country be allowed to stay away from the capital, live in peace and recover, or retreat into seclusion and enjoy their reputation? The nation's lifeline is now hanging by a thread. Today, we should wash away the old grudges with sincere tears and face the current national crisis with firm unity, or continue to go our separate ways, arguing endlessly, leading to the country's destruction and family ruin. The annihilation of the race: where to go and how to act should be a matter of self-selection. Therefore, the leaders should not harbor suspicions in their minds today, and even more so, they should not plan to wait for an opportunity to make a comeback. If the national crisis cannot promote domestic unity but instead increases the risk of division, then the country's future will truly never see the light of day. We are deeply concerned that the Party and government leaders still cannot unite sincerely to face the national crisis and must loudly appeal for action.</p>
<p>The loss of the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin occurred during the Zhang Zongchang era. We could still attribute it to the sudden onset of the crisis and the lack of preparation. This time, the Japanese army's attack on Jinzhou was preceded by propaganda. With strong enemies at our doorstep, we should have been on high alert. Ma Zhanshan, with his isolated army in a remote area, defended a dangerous city and fought hard for more than ten days before Longjiang fell. The Northeast had more than 200,000 soldiers, but the important town of Jinzhou was easily allowed to be overrun by the invading army. This can only be due to a lack of thorough preparation or a lack of determination to defend it to the end. If it is said that there were not enough troops to deploy, then Jinzhou only had three brigades stationed there, while a large army was stationed inside the Shanhaiguan Pass, remaining idle and not moving. If it is said that ammunition was exhausted and there was no way to resupply, then Jinzhou did not engage in any fierce battles, and the large army inside the Pass did not have any preparation to go out and rescue it from beginning to end. We only heard the news of the preparation for the establishment of the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, but we never heard of any concrete plans to resist the invading army. At the same time, written and telegraphic propaganda clearly showed that another form of situation was being brewed domestically. This phenomenon is most heartbreaking. We believe that with the national crisis at this point, the evil consequences of the expansion of military power and the fragmentation of the country over the past twenty years have truly been reaped today. From now on, the military should deeply regret the disaster and thoroughly reform itself. It must restrain its ambition to carve out territory and claim hegemony and promote a unified and peaceful situation. The gun barrel must be uniformly directed outwards, and military force must truly be used to defend the country. If the invading enemy is at the doorstep and the divisions are becoming more apparent, with each faction forming alliances and standing in opposition to each other, then once the nest is overturned, who can survive alone? If the country is destroyed, can the carve-up of territory be preserved? This is the second point that we are deeply concerned about the fact that the military is still unable to make a determination to resist foreign aggression and must loudly appeal for action.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>In his New Year's Day address, Japanese cabinet member Inukai Tsuyoshi recently stated, "Currently, China is being harmed by ambitious warlords, politicians, communists, and other lawless elements, and is temporarily in a state of anarchy, losing the essence and form of a nation." His words are cold and profound enough to provoke deep reflection in us. We believe that if we want to talk about saving the country today, the most important thing is unity. If we want to talk about internal stability, we must first resist foreign aggression. We must never allow the division to be created again. The people of the country should strictly supervise the government and urge the leaders to take consistent steps and determination to jointly save the current crisis. If the country is in such a dangerous state, what would the situation be like in Europe and the United States, where the people's outrage would be boiling over? Looking back at our country today, the whole country is silent and there is still no serious expression. Fellow countrymen, with the danger of national destruction imminent, if we do not rise up, what are we waiting for?</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Three</p>
<h3>Shi Zhaoji to Leave England for Spain or Northern Finland for Recuperation</h3>
<p>London: Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese ambassador to England, fell ill from overwork while handling the Manchurian case at the League of Nations Council in Paris. He has not yet recovered. Doctors have now instructed him to rest for several months. Reuters has learned that Dr. Shi believes it is necessary to ask the Chinese government to send someone to serve as acting ambassador to England. According to reports, Dr. Shi went to a sanatorium in Paris for treatment after the Council meeting and then returned to England to rest in the countryside. He returned to London today to ask doctors for an examination. The results showed that his health had not recovered and he still needed to rest. Dr. Shi is now planning to leave London on January 9 for Malaga in Spain or may go to Northern Finland, but it is not yet known. Dr. Shi's illness is not serious, but he should not overwork. If he leaves England in the winter and lives in a sunny and warm place for one or two months, he can regain his strength. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Our Country Requests the League of Nations to Convene a Special Meeting</h3>
<p>Paris: It is reported that the Chinese government has sent a telegram to the League of Nations Council requesting that it convene a meeting immediately because the Japanese army has occupied Jinzhou. Hu Shize, the Chinese representative, left Paris this morning by car for Geneva, which must be related to this matter. However, the Secretariat of the League of Nations has not yet issued a notice regarding the convening of a special meeting. At the same time, all members of the Council have received reports on the military actions in Manchuria. Today, Briand notified the members of the document recently sent by Mr. Hu, which asked the Council to pay attention to the Japanese advance into Jinzhou and expressed the hope that the League of Nations would take all possible measures to stop the expansion of the serious situation and guarantee the implementation of the resolution of the Council meeting on December 10.

<h3>Japanese Government Plans to Disclose Secret Sino-Japanese Draft Treaty</h3>
<p>As a Basis for Exclusive Railway Rights</p>
<p>Tokyo: Gu Weijun, the former Chinese Foreign Minister, recently published an article stating that no contract was ever concluded between China and Japan regarding the laying of railways in Manchuria that would not be parallel to the South Manchurian Railway. According to sources in responsible circles today, the Japanese government intends to disclose the full text of the 1905 Sino-Japanese Agreement and various records to prove that China had earnestly promised not to build railways parallel to the South Manchurian Railway. It is reported that the original text of this agreement was secretly shown to Britain and the United States after its conclusion, but Japan did not publish the original text at China's request. The main points of the agreement have been seen in the "MacMurray's Treaties and Agreements With and Concerning China, 1894-1919" published several years ago. This book was written by MacMurray, a former ambassador to the United States and Britain, but it has not been cited by anyone so far, so its authenticity has often been questioned. The Japanese government believes that the time has come to publish the original text of this agreement to avoid further questions. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>White Russian Thugs Disrupt Public Order in Harbin</h3>
<p>Gathering Over 10,000 People to Block Traffic</p>
<p>Clashing with Our Police</p>
<p>Japanese Behind the Scenes</p>
<p>Harbin: At 6 PM tonight, over 10,000 White Russians gathered on Central Avenue in Daoli, blocking traffic, intercepting pedestrians and vehicles, and marching along the street, driving away patrol police to the gate of the Special Police Management Office for demonstrations that lasted for a long time. Traffic was blocked, and the order of the city streets was greatly disturbed at 3 PM. Wang Rui, the director of the Special Police Office, hid himself when the incident occurred, and officers could not find him everywhere. The cause of this incident was that a week ago, a Russian pretended to be shopping and took the opportunity to steal candies from the Heshengli Sugar Food Store on Central Avenue, clashing with the store. He was injured by a clerk with a hammer and died in the hospital one day later. The Russians were greatly angered. One day at 4 PM, several people gave speeches on the street, saying that it was shameful for Russians, as people of a fallen country, to be beaten to death and that they should seek revenge. They gathered many people, broke into Heshengli, dragged out its director, and beat him severely on the street, almost to death. The police came to mediate and stop it, and after firing shots into the air to intimidate them, they arrested one person. The Russians then beat drums and shouted. As of the time of sending the telegram, the Russians had not dispersed and were blocking the street with tables and chairs, shouting slogans on the street, and traffic was completely blocked. A car from the Japanese consulate was driven out four times, and the Russians shouted "Long live" when the car passed and allowed it to pass. Chinese eyewitnesses were all indignant at the cowardice of the authorities. When the Russians rioted today, a special policeman incited the crowd to destroy the doors and windows of Heshengli and seized police firearms. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>The White Russian riot in Harbin has not yet ended today. At 11 AM this morning, over a thousand Russian rioters were still gathering in front of Heshengli on Central Avenue, dragging stone tables and chairs and piling them up in the center of the street, planning to block traffic. The special police could no longer tolerate this and dispatched an armed police brigade, taking control of the crossroads and opening fire to drive them away. Four rioters were injured by gunfire before the rioters dispersed. By 3 PM in the afternoon, the streets were still under martial law. The Russian rioters were dispersed by police gunfire and immediately carried to the Japanese consulate to petition, demanding that they protest to the Chinese authorities to punish the police authorities.

After 12 o'clock, the entire garrison force was dispatched, and the rioters began to disperse. The police were still on high alert on the 5th, and four posts were stationed at each intersection.

The authorities have obtained evidence. It is reported that the Japanese consul's move, in addition to creating a pretext for sending troops to Harbin, is to overthrow Wang Ruihua, the head of the special police force, because Wang is a man of Zhang Xueliang and is considered to be related to the old regime.

<h3>Indian Anti-British Movement Resumes</h3>
<p>Gandhi and the Viceroy of India Exchange Letters and Telegrams</p>
<p>The Viceroy of India Disregards the Disruption of the Delhi Agreement</p>
<p>And Actually Refuses to Meet with Gandhi</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, December 31st: Some time ago, Gandhi sent a telegram to Viceroy Willingdon, inquiring whether recently promulgated ordinances signified a complete breakdown in relations between the government and the All-India Congress Committee. Yesterday, the Viceroy spoke in reply, saying that the government would take steps to stop anyone attempting to disrupt the rule of law or halt administration. The All-India Congress Working Committee was extremely dissatisfied with this statement. Gandhi then telegraphed the Viceroy, saying that he was now considering resuming non-violent resistance. If he was willing to grant an audience, he would suspend his planned actions pending the outcome of the talks. The Viceroy immediately replied to Gandhi, saying he was willing to talk, but would not discuss measures necessary to maintain the rule of law. Gandhi then replied with a lengthy message, expressing deep regret that the Viceroy had rejected his extremely friendly proposal.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 2nd: Viceroy Willingdon arrived in Delhi by plane this morning, immediately convened an executive meeting, and then sent a letter to Gandhi, condemning the impropriety of the All-India Congress Working Committee passing a resolution to resume non-violent resistance. He also said that the government would not be intimidated by the illegal actions of any political group, nor would it change its policy based on Gandhi's views. Finally, he rejected Gandhi's audience, stating that the government would hold Gandhi and the All-India Congress accountable for the consequences of all actions taken by the All-India Congress, and would take necessary measures to deal with them. After receiving the letter, Gandhi laughed it off, saying that the government and the Viceroy, on the pretext of the so-called resumption of non-violent resistance as intimidation, refused to grant an audience, committing the crime of disrupting the Delhi Agreement. If non-violent resistance was the greatest of evils, then the Indian government would never have sent him to London to participate in the Round Table Conference. Now that times have changed and circumstances have shifted, the whole nation must respond to the government's challenge. No self-respecting person can accept the Viceroy's conditions. Gandhi has called on the people to engage in the strictest non-violent resistance in thought, word, and deed, and hopes that all Indians will fulfill the promise made to MacDonald at the Round Table Conference, that is, to harbor no ill will in the struggle. Indians must not take meaningless actions. Gandhi also telegraphed the United States today, saying, "I am now embarking on a struggle that will become the most intense. I hope that many American friends will observe its progress and use the power of their great nation to seek happiness for oppressed humanity."</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 3rd: Gandhi has replied to the Viceroy's telegram, expressing regret at the government's refusal to meet with him, and saying that the government mistakenly regarded the All-India Congress's sincere expression of its views as intimidation. When the Delhi negotiations were underway, non-violent resistance was in progress. The Delhi Agreement was reached, but non-violent resistance was not ended, only temporarily suspended. Finally, he said that in engaging in the struggle, he would do his best to ensure that there was no ill will and no violence.</p>
<h3>Gandhi and Patel Arrested and Imprisoned</h3>
<p>An Admonition to the Nation Not to Riot</p>
<p>Ansari Succeeds as Congress President</p>
<p>Bombay, 4th: Gandhi was arrested at his residence in Bombay at 4 a.m. this morning. Chief of Police Wilson led six officers to the scene. Several officers attempted to enter the tent where Gandhi was sleeping, but were stopped by guards. Gandhi was awakened by the commotion. As today was his weekly day of silence, he did not speak, but smiled and saluted the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police presented the arrest warrant, which Gandhi received, reviewed, and then returned to the Chief of Police, willingly submitting to arrest without trouble. Those in Gandhi's ashram bid a sorrowful farewell to their leader, the scene deeply moving. Many women wept bitterly. Gandhi's wife, in tears, asked the Chief of Police for permission to accompany her husband to prison. Gandhi, however, remained composed and smiled. Before leaving, Gandhi left a letter to Patel, President of the All-India Congress Committee, saying, "God is merciful and limitless. Please tell the nation never to abandon truth and non-violent policies, never to flinch, and to sacrifice their lives and everything to achieve autonomy." After writing the letter, Gandhi was taken to prison by car with the police chief and others. His comrades shouted "Long live Gandhi!" to see him off.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 4th: Shortly after Gandhi's arrest, Patel was also arrested. Both were taken by police car to Yerwada Jail in Pune. Patel, knowing it was inevitable, had already appointed Barrister Prasad, a member of the All-India Congress Committee's Executive Committee, as his successor. Before going to prison, Patel issued a message to the nation, saying, "This will be a fierce war to the very end. I hope the whole nation will make noble sacrifices with a spirit of non-violence."</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 5th: Barrister Prasad, the second Congress President, was also arrested. Dr. Ansari has now been appointed to fill the vacancy.</p>
<h3>Provinces Resolutely Resist the Indian Government</h3>
<p>Plans for a Protracted War are Being Drawn Up in Detail</p>
<p>Bombay Halts Trade and Implements Boycott</p>
<p>Bombay, 5th: The fact that many provinces have appointed "dictators" today proves that detailed plans for long-term resistance have been made. Provincial Congress Committees have largely replaced the original "War Council" with "dictators." All "dictators" have the power to begin implementing their set procedures without being subject to headquarters' direction. They also have the power to appoint a deputy when arrested. To prepare for injuries to comrades in clashes with the police, the Congress has established two hospitals, each with 450 beds, and 90 volunteer doctors and nurses. It is reported that 10,000 volunteers have joined. The Congress has appointed 60 "War Inspection" groups, so even if the government arrests one group every day, the Congress can fight for two months.</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 4th: After Gandhi's arrest, Bombay responded immediately. Fourteen of the city's seventy-two yarn factories closed. Exchanges for major grains, cotton, and other commodities were all halted. The Indian Hindu residential areas of Bombay have announced a strike and plan to hold a parade and meeting in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 5th: Today, the people of Allahabad marched in protest of Gandhi's arrest. A clash with the police resulted in two deaths and several injuries. There were also disturbances elsewhere. After Gandhi's arrest, his comrades issued Gandhi's declaration, which stated that the whole nation must awaken, reject foreign cloth, foreign medicine, and foreign wine, and stop all cooperation with the government, but must not commit any acts of violence, and especially must protect British women and children, regardless of their background.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 3rd: A delegation from the Bombay Cotton Merchants' Association met with Gandhi and declared that under the current circumstances, they would not ship a single bale of cotton abroad. At a meeting of the Charkha Association today, thousands of people attended and presented the chairman with checks and cash, in response to a newspaper report that the Congress lacked funds, to demonstrate that this was not true. At the time, women also donated gold and silver jewelry to the Congress, as if in a frenzy. Many gave stimulating speeches in the meeting place and used various images to show the lives of Indians under the new laws.</p>
<h3>All India Congress Leaders Continue to be Searched and Arrested</h3>
<p>The Viceroy Issues New Orders Banning Gatherings</p>
<p>Calcutta Strike Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 4th: The Viceroy issued four orders today, the most important of which stipulate that the central government has the prerogative to maintain law and order and manage newspapers, and has the power to declare any organization within India illegal. It also declared that pickets who maintain order while performing their duties are committing a crime.</p>
<p>Reuters, Allahabad, 4th: All-India Congress leaders Nehru and Sherwani were arrested and imprisoned today for disobeying deportation orders. Nehru was sentenced to two years in prison and a fine of 500 rupees, while Sherwani was sentenced to six months in prison and a fine of 150 rupees.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 6th: At 4:30 a.m. this morning, police went to various locations to make a large number of arrests of All-India Congress leaders. Similar news has come from other important locations. Houses suspected of illegal activities have been searched and the contents seized in 60 houses in Calcutta. Authorities now believe that the non-violent resistance movement is secretly funded by Bombay, and it is reported that the Congress has raised £150,000 for this purpose. Authorities in Madras have disbanded illegal meetings and arrested 150 leaders. The announced strike in Calcutta was unsuccessful and business continues as usual. Important members of the Congress and well-known Indians have issued declarations against armed resistance. Liberal Party leader Sir Sapru also opposes the anti-rent movement, saying that this action is fraught with danger and could lead to class warfare and destroy the current social order. He says that the actions of the current Congress Committee are rash, and that non-violent resistance and the arrest of Gandhi and others are not enough to permanently resolve the situation. The Viceroy has now summoned those who have expressed their intention to cooperate with the Round Table Conference committee, which will arrive in India soon, to attend a meeting to discuss long-term plans.</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Briand Falls Ill</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 5th: Today, Paris is rife with rumors that French Foreign Minister Briand is seriously ill. The French Foreign Ministry acknowledged that Briand was ill, but said it was not serious, only that he was weak after treatment. However, according to Briand's friends, he suffered a sudden heart attack on Monday and another on Tuesday, and his condition is now quite dangerous. Briand is 70 years old.</p>
<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from Suizhong: To all newspapers, the Japanese have violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact and disregarded three resolutions of the League of Nations, invading Jin in recent days with both land and air forces. Our soldiers and civilians have worked together to resist, fighting fiercely for several days and nights, but due to the disparity in strength, they finally withdrew. Under these extraordinary circumstances, this government, along with the Public Security Team, temporarily left Jin County this morning. This government has a duty to defend the territory, but failed to resist the enemy, causing the territory to fall and sovereignty to be lost. I have no face to face the elders, and am even more ashamed to the country. The telegram is urgent and I am overwhelmed with anxiety. Liaoning Provincial Government bows.</p>
<p>Telegram from Cuba: Please translate and send to the National Government for consideration. The new government has been formed, and all overseas Chinese are delighted. Please immediately order the national army to resist the Japanese, recover the territory, and protect national sovereignty. Zhang Xueliang is in charge of border defense but does not resist the Japanese bandits. Please punish him severely. The Cuban Guangdong Jiujiang Village Anti-Japanese Association bows.</p>
<p>Telegram from Harbin: To the Shen Bao Newspaper, transferred to all overseas Chinese in Surabaya. Your telegram is gratefully received. Your generous gift from afar is deeply appreciated by the entire army. The funds have been dispatched to Harbin for transfer. Thank you. Ma Zhanshan pays his respects.</p>

<h3>Our Army Withdraws from Jinzhou</h3>
<p>The Border Defense Commander-in-Chief's Office Relocated to Lüzhou</p>
<p>Troops Withdraw to Areas Around Changli and Tangshan</p>
<p>Joint Declaration Issued by Officers of All Ranks</p>
<p>Rong Zhen and His Entourage Depart Jin First</p>
<p>Heavy Artillery Fire East of Jin County Railway Station</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Repeatedly Bomb Jin</p>
<p>People of Jin Firmly Ask Huang Xiansheng to Cede Territory</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Jinzhou: Our army in eastern Jin has suffered three-pronged attacks from the enemy, who are using aircraft, tanks, armored vehicles and other sophisticated weapons. Our Northeast Army is inherently weaker. The Battle of Panshan resulted in extremely heavy casualties and losses. Li's battalion of the 19th Brigade was almost completely wiped out. On the 29th, Rong Zhen, Chief of Staff of the Border Defense Commander-in-Chief's Office stationed in Jin, returned from Beiping after meeting with Zhang, and immediately convened a meeting of all generals, while ordering all troops to withdraw to within the Shanhaiguan Pass. The Jin Office of the Beining Railway was instructed to prepare 150 vehicles and 7 locomotives, and it was decided to relocate the Commander-in-Chief's Office to Lüzhou. On the 30th, two section chiefs were dispatched with the 12th Brigade's troop train, attached with a first-class carriage, to Lüzhou to prepare the administrative headquarters. The forward troops then began to cover the withdrawal to areas around Changli, Lüzhou, and Tangshan. The plan was for the 12th Infantry Brigade to retreat to Lüzhou, the 19th Brigade to retreat to Changli, the 20th Brigade to retreat to Qian'an, and the Supply and Transport Training Battalion to retreat to Tangshan. The 13th Artillery Regiment, the Independent 1st Battalion of Engineers, and the Communications Battalion would also retreat to Lüzhou. The 3rd Cavalry Brigade, which was defending Dahushan, retreated from Da'atong Road to Yixian. The 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment under Huang Xiansheng, Chief of the Police Department, retreated to Lüzhou, and the 3rd Battalion opened up the Daling River. On the morning of the 31st, junior officers at the front issued a joint declaration in Jin, the main points of which were: (1) The Japanese army is now attacking Jin from three directions. There has been bloody fighting for five days. Corpses are strewn about Yingkou Line, Tianzhuangtai, Beining Line, Baiqipu, Da'atong Line, and Baishan, and animals are fighting over the remains, a heartbreaking sight. Since the convocation of the First Plenary Session of the Central Committee, three telegrams have been sent to the Central Government requesting the dispatch of ammunition and supplies, but there has been no response. (2) The Japanese are increasing troops in Tianjin and Qinhuangdao, disturbing our rear. More than ten of their warships have gone to places such as Qinhuangdao and Huludao, spying on our border defenses. Their air force has also destroyed our railways in Lianshan and Xingcheng, cutting off our reinforcements. It has been a week now, and we have not heard of the Central Government lodging a single protest with Japan. Is there any reason to believe that the Jinzhou front can win when the route back is cut off? The declaration was sent by telegram from the telegraph bureau, and at the same time, most of the troops began to retreat westward. It was reported that the Japanese army had reached Goubangzi. Mr. Magruder, the U.S. military attaché stationed in Jin, and others traveled east by car to meet with the Japanese army commander to stop the advance, but they were detained by the Japanese military police. Only after repeated explanations were they released. That day, Japanese planes flew over five times, and flew very low. Women and children fled west to avoid disaster. Merchants and civilians inside and outside the city also mostly suspended business on their own. At 9:00 p.m., Rong Zhen, Chief of Staff of the Border Defense Commander-in-Chief's Office, and his entourage of more than 50 guards, left westward by special train. The train consisted of one first-class carriage and four third-class carriages, while the staff of various offices took the Beining 4th special express train behind. Rong's special train arrived at the Nu'er River, and was blocked by a train of twenty pieces of furniture, military affairs, and carriages ahead. It was attached to the rear of that train and pulled forward by two locomotives. After Rong left, Huang Xiansheng, Chief of the Police Department, acted on behalf of the Jin Provincial Government, and worked with County Magistrate Gu Jinsheng to maintain law and order. All local self-defense groups were mobilized. The county magistrate also issued a proclamation, expressing his responsibility to maintain local law and order and urging merchants and civilians not to panic. All defensive works inside and outside the city were constructed. The chairman of the local Chamber of Commerce and the chairman of the Farmers' Association repeatedly asked Huang on the morning of the 1st not to defend the city inside and outside, lest the entire city be destroyed by Japanese artillery fire. Huang said that he was determined to die with the city. He hoped that the people would also have the determination to sacrifice their homes and devote themselves to the country. The Beining Railway's original office stationed in Jin was forced to move to Xingcheng. At 3:00 p.m., three Japanese planes dropped 25 bombs on the streets and markets inside the city, destroying five houses, killing four villagers, and injuring five. Five bombs fell on the Provincial Government, but fortunately no one was injured, only many houses were damaged. All the staff were working in the cellar. The planes also dropped many leaflets, falsely claiming that the commander of the Japanese headquarters had come to Jinzhou to persuade the people to open the city and welcome them, and also leaflets persuading the troops to surrender, saying that after the establishment of the new governments in Nanjing and Tokyo, both sides had reached an agreement. Why are you fighting to the death, causing the people of Jinzhou to suffer? As a result, the people of Jinzhou were very panicked. At about 8:00 p.m., the Chamber of Commerce and five representatives met with Huang Xiansheng again, requesting that the troops not be stationed in the city, and said that 50,000 people did not want to make unnecessary sacrifices. More and more representatives gathered, increasing to more than 40 people. They dispersed late at night. On the morning of the 2nd, two trains of wounded soldiers passed through Jin to Yu, numbering about 900 or more. More than 150 seriously wounded died in the carriages. The people were extremely frightened by this tragic situation. The chairman of the Chamber of Commerce again led a delegation to Huang Xiansheng requesting that they not defend Jinzhou to the death, and asked that the artillery positions on the city walls be abandoned. Huang was in a difficult position, but still did not agree, saying that he was determined to defend Jinzhou and would never retreat. At 2:00 p.m., it was reported that more than 2,000 Japanese troops had crossed the Daling River, with eight artillery pieces attached. At 5:00 p.m., they occupied the Shangjitai Railway Station. At 7:00 p.m., there was heavy artillery fire east of the Jin County Railway Station, and it seemed that several places were on fire. The telephone and telegraph lines were cut. Railway employees at the station were forced to flee to the Nu'er River and Xingcheng. (Sent at 10:00 p.m. on January 2)</p>
<h3>Battle Around Goubangzi</h3>
<p>Our Army Suffered Great Losses</p>
<p>More Than 2,000 Deaths</p>
<p>Correspondence from Goubangzi: On the 29th of last month, Panshan fell. One battalion of our army's 19th Brigade, the 654th Regiment, led by Li Decai, was disarmed by the Japanese army, with nearly half of them killed. At the same time, our army stationed at Dahushan was also surrounded by the Japanese army on three sides, and was forced to retreat to Goubangzi. At 6:00 a.m. on the morning of the 30th, Japanese cavalry from Panshan again broke through our army's first line of defense in Yangquanzi, destroying all telegram and telephone lines. Two companies of our cavalry were surrounded and disarmed. On the morning of the 31st, it was heard that Commander Tamon of the Japanese army had ordered a meeting at Goubangzi that day. The volunteers stationed in Goubangzi, compelled by indignation, prepared to make a final sacrifice. At the same time, they issued a declaration, which stated in brief: "In recent days, the oppression by the Japanese invaders has become urgent, and they have advanced westward from three directions. Wherever the invaders go, they kill, plunder, and rape. Our volunteers, for the sake of self-defense, are cooperating with the local garrison to resist. However, the Japanese army is advancing by land and air, and their artillery fire is especially fierce, causing our army to fall one after another, with heavy casualties. However, our volunteers will never retreat or yield because of this. However, ammunition is running out and sources have been cut off. With a great enemy in front, it is difficult to capture them alive with bare hands. Half of the mountains and rivers of western Liaoning are about to fall. The danger of the country cannot be described as urgent. At this time of national crisis, when the nation is in danger, the leaders of the party and state are still engaged in the distribution of high positions, and there is no way to make the 30 million innocent people fall into deep water and fire. The 10,000 miles of great territory are being lost to the iron hooves of the barbarians. It is heartbreaking and unbearable. The Northeast is the Northeast of all Chinese people. Our 30 million people in the Northeast believe that our 400 million compatriots across the country have a common demand, which is peaceful unification. There is no division between north and south in the face of national crisis. To our volunteers who are killing thieves for the country and fighting for the survival of the nation, we can give them our warm sympathy. However, the volunteers are under intense artillery fire and in this ice-cold area, without food or supplies. Although they can be raised on the spot, the lack of ammunition makes it difficult to replenish them. We hope that our compatriots across the country will find ways to provide them with practical assistance, so that our 30 million people can use this full of blood to splash between this Baishan and Blackwater, to irrigate the flowers of freedom of our Chinese nation. If the enemy's atmosphere is not calmed, we will not survive. Alas, the enemy's artillery is firing, and the sound of killing the enemy is rising. We respectfully bid farewell to our compatriots who are killing the enemy and rushing to danger, and the tears are urgent and there are no tears to wave," etc. This declaration was sent by telegram from the telegraph bureau. At 4:00 p.m., Japanese planes came to drop several bombs, and battles broke out east of Yangquanzi. On the morning of the 1st, Tamon's division of the Japanese army sent six more planes to sweep and strafe vehicles transporting between Gou and Jin, and used more than two brigades of troops to encircle Lijia Wobao and attack Goubangzi. At that time, the volunteers came out to meet the battle, led by Xiong Fei (Xiong graduated from Baoding Military Academy and served as the acting director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau during the Shenyang Incident), together with the 658th Regiment of our infantry, led by Gao Zhengqing, Zhu Shiqing, Rong Bingyan, and the 39th Regiment of the 3rd Cavalry Brigade led by Xu Ying, and the 40th Regiment led by Wang Zhiting (who had previously defeated the Japanese army and Mongolian bandits in Tongliao), resisted desperately. By evening, the Japanese artillery fire was even more intense, and the entire line of Goubangzi was broken. Xiong then negotiated the transfer of a part of the 654th Regiment of the 19th Brigade and the Xu Liang unit of the 40th Cavalry Regiment, which were fighting in Yantun, to join the front line in Goubangzi. Our infantry Li Decai's battalion had already suffered more than half of its casualties in Panshan on the 29th, and was transferred here to reinforce in the evening. The combat strength was relatively weak, and the entire battalion was wiped out. In this one day and night, the total number of deaths in Yantun, Panshan, Panjia Wobao, Yangquanzi, Youweitun, and Fenglezhen was about 2,100 or more. Our side's treatment of the wounded was far inferior to that of the Japanese army. There was only one railway treatment center in Goubangzi, with a very small capacity. It was necessary to transport them to within the Shanhaiguan Pass. By the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese army gradually retreated, and the Goubangzi front was in complete disarray. It is now being reorganized. (Sent at 6:00 a.m. on January 2)</p>
<h3>Ma Zhanshan Plans to Counterattack Amid Tensions in Jin</h3>
<p>Orders All Armies to Prepare to Advance</p>
<p>Japanese Army Deploys Bandit Army to Strengthen Defense</p>
<p>Correspondence from Harbin: Ma Zhanshan went to inspect defenses along the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway on the 22nd, and returned to Hailun on the 26th. Upon hearing of the emergency situation in Jinzhou, he issued an order on the 27th to all cavalry brigades stationed along the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway, the Cheng Zhiyuan Brigade and the Wu Songlin Brigade, and the infantry Yuan Chonggu Brigade, to open up the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway line and concentrate at Aolonggou and Taian Town to await orders. Han Shoupeng was appointed as the transportation commander, leading one battalion of soldiers to set up three supply stations at Ningnian, Taian Town, and Keshan on the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway to actively prepare. Han led his troops to deploy on the 29th. As Ma Zhanshan lacked vehicles on the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway and military control was required, a plan was needed in advance. He appointed Bao Rulin as the assistant on the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway, responsible for military transportation. On the 27th, Ma sent a telegram asking the Beiping side whether an attack could be launched. There were no instructions from the Beiping side. Yesterday, the plainclothes team of the Yuan Chonggu Brigade had already been dispatched to operate in the suburbs near Heihe. Once the military operation is launched, they can enter the city at any time. The student army newly recruited by Ma Zhanshan has recently been formed, and is currently undergoing intensive training. They plan to use them as a commando unit when the military operation proceeds. Because Ma Zhanshan has made preparations for a counterattack, the Japanese army in Heihe has become panicked again. On the evening of the 27th, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers and cavalry stationed in Heihe were dispatched outside the city to set up defenses along the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway, and artillery was also dispatched to the head station of the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway. A special curfew was imposed in the city that night. Anyone without a password was not allowed to pass after 5:00 p.m. Three people were tragically shot and killed by the Japanese army for not knowing the password. Preparations were still strict on the 28th and 29th. The Japanese army also guarded against any changes in Zhang Jinghui's temporary garrison, and specially used the newly arrived bandit armies of Wang Dianzhong and Li Shoushan to monitor them. Therefore, the situation in the city was quite serious. On the 28th, a Japanese plane flew to reconnaissance along the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway line. It circled over all the Black Army's stationing points for a long time, and dropped three bombs when it reached Keshan, which fell within the regiment headquarters of the local defense army, Wang Kezhen. Two soldiers and three horses were injured. Later, our army drove them back by opening fire. On the 28th, the Japanese army drove an armored vehicle to the Tahaer Station on the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway, confronting our Linjiadian defense army across the river. On the evening of the 28th, there was a clash between the patrols of the two armies, and they were driven back by our army. The official opening of fire will be within one or two days when our army receives the order. The Japanese side said that the bandit armies of Wang Dianzhong and Li Shoushan were former subordinates of Zhang Zongchang and newly recruited bandits in western Liaoning, called the Fengtian Autonomous Army, numbering about 1,500. Their firearms and clothing were all transferred by the Japanese side from our Beidaying camp. Recently, the Japanese army, considering the emptiness of the Heihe city defense, transferred all of the bandit army into Heihe to help defend it. The bandit army entered Heihe on the 25th and stationed in the East Camp. Wang Dianzhong, in the name of the Autonomous Army Commander General, which was given to him by the Japanese side, issued a proclamation stating that the army's arrival in Heihe was to protect the ground, and merchants could operate as usual, and soldiers would buy and sell publicly, etc. Li Shoushan was called the Commander-in-Chief of the Front and stationed outside the city. Because a bandit army had entered the city, merchants were afraid of being ravaged, so they closed their doors for half a day. They resumed business a few days ago after being forced by the Japanese army. Currently, the security of Heihe is still the responsibility of the Security Maintenance Association. Previously, there were as many as 42 committee members. Now, in order to facilitate affairs, Zhang Jinghui ordered a change to the chairman system, with Ji Xiang and Li Weizhou and others serving as chairmen and vice chairmen, and the association divided into four sections: general affairs, investigation, document, and accounting, with the office located in the Provincial Government.

<h3>Sun Ke's Report on the New Government's Situation</h3>
<p>Regarding various issues related to internal affairs, foreign affairs, and finance, Sun Ke, the President of the Executive Yuan, held a reception for the press at the Ministry of Railways' official residence at 4:00 PM on January 5th. Over fifty reporters from newspapers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan attended. Sun Ke delivered an important report on the political situation following the establishment of the new government:</p>
<p>(1) The Organic Law of the National Government was amended by the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, with slight changes to the system. Previously, the five Yuans were responsible to the National Government, but now they are responsible to the Central Executive Committee. The heads of the five Yuans independently exercise their powers and are responsible to the Central Political Council, the highest executive political body of the Central Committee. All major policies, both domestic and foreign, must be discussed and decided by the Central Political Council to ensure that the government has a direction to follow. Although the Executive Yuan bears the actual political responsibility, the Central Political Council is the highest leading political body. This differs from a responsible cabinet system where the Prime Minister decides political policies and submits them to the parliament for approval and implementation. Therefore, since the Executive Yuan cannot independently decide on important national affairs, the sound organization of the Central Political Council is a matter of utmost urgency. The First Plenary Session elected Comrades Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and Chiang Kai-shek as Standing Committee members of the Central Political Council, responsible for the highest guidance. It is imperative that they come to Nanjing together in the shortest possible time to jointly decide on national affairs, jointly overcome national difficulties, and consolidate the foundation of the central authority. Only then can the important policies of the Party and the nation proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding diplomatic issues, the general public is outraged by the blatant disregard of treaties, public reason, and morality by the tyrannical Japanese, who have invaded our territory and disrupted world peace. Everyone advocates actively resisting them with the nation's military force. The Central Political Council previously decided to request the League of Nations to promptly and effectively stop the Japanese aggression in accordance with the Covenant. However, Japan remains defiant, and Jinzhou has fallen again. The public's anger is growing, and the demands on domestic military and political authorities are becoming more urgent. The call for an immediate order for a nationwide mobilization to recover lost territories is almost unanimous. This expression from the people shows that the nation still has vitality. This significant awakening must be maintained permanently and should not lead to discouragement due to temporary setbacks. If everyone is determined and resolved to fight, there will eventually be a day to defeat the powers. However, the government's difficult position should also be understood by the people. For the past twenty years, internal wars have been frequent, and construction has been neglected. Preparations for national defense have always been inadequate. It is essential for the entire nation to cooperate with the government, and for the government itself to be united in dealing with the current crisis. Only then can things be accomplished. The current diplomatic situation is so urgent that the government must jointly study this major issue through the Central Political Council, determining whether to seek peace or engage in war, and deciding on a general policy based on the public will. Before the arrival of the three Standing Committee members, Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and Chiang Kai-shek, the political center is lacking, so a decision cannot be made rashly.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of finance, the difficulties are unprecedented. After the Finance Committee's review and reduction of national military and administrative expenses, the monthly shortfall is approximately 16 million yuan. Previously, the method of maintaining the situation relied entirely on issuing public bonds. Now, merchants and the public can no longer bear the burden. Continuing to raise funds by issuing new public bonds is practically impossible. However, the punctual repayment of principal and interest on various public bonds must be maintained to protect credit and avoid disrupting the financial system. Based on the principles of the peace conference, the new government will not only make finance absolutely transparent but also make financial power absolutely transparent. Today's State Council meeting has revised the organizational regulations of the Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is responsible for implementing supervision, while the Ministry of Finance only has the power to execute. Military expenditures are limited to national defense and bandit suppression. If the government diverts finances for internal warfare, the Finance Committee has the power to reject it.</p>
<p>(4) In recent times, the political corruption in various provinces has caused deep suffering for the people. During the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, people from various provinces who have suffered greatly constantly petitioned for relief. The government should investigate and handle these matters according to the law. The establishment of this unified government is by no means based on military force. Every political change in China has relied on a military background as a transfer of power, with military strength as the foundation, which has often created an ominous situation. The current government's emergence is purely through peaceful means and political power to achieve considerable results. The so-called political power is based on the thorough awakening and sincere unity of the Party's leaders and all Party members. However, relying solely on Party unity to promote politics may still be insufficient. The Party's strength should be built on the foundation of the masses, seeking welfare for the people based on the Three Principles of the People, strengthening their organization, and increasing their faith. Then, the people's strength will be the Party's strength, which is also political power. In the past, the phenomena exhibited by our Party have inevitably led the public to believe that it has lost its leadership position and strength, resulting in some disappointment. From now on, everyone should deeply reflect on themselves, severely criticize themselves, and jointly create a new life. The only current request is that the Party's highest leaders can each sacrifice their prejudices and come together to take responsibility to establish a political center. Otherwise, diplomacy will lose its effectiveness and remain unresolved for a long time, the danger is unimaginable.</p>
<p>(5) Within the shortest possible time, a National Crisis Conference and a National Salvation Conference will be organized, with people's representatives sharing the responsibility of responding to the national crisis with the government.</p>
<p>(6) The President of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, felt that his talent and ability were insufficient and repeatedly declined the position. He recommended that Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin, and Chiang Kai-shek be selected, but due to various reasons, all three found it difficult to take responsibility immediately. Therefore, he reluctantly accepted the position. There are two functions of his acceptance of this commission: first, to serve as a transitional buffer and temporarily maintain the status quo; second, to do cement work, creating a solid binding of cement to build a permanent foundation. If this unity fails, causing the Party and the nation to remain in danger, and politics remains unstable, then any leader within the Party cannot avoid considerable responsibility, etc.</p>
<p>Sun Ke also answered reporters' questions, mentioning four points:</p>
<p>(1) The Guangzhou National Government was in fact abolished as agreed on New Year's Day, but the announcement has not yet been received.</p>
<p>(2) The establishment of the Executive Department, Military Commission, and Finance Committee in Guangzhou is based on the resolutions of the Fourth National Congress. This case has now been submitted to the First Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and has been resolved to be handled by the Central Standing Committee. The Shanghai Peace Conference resolution did not have this provision. The members in Beijing from Guangdong have telegraphed to urge them to pay attention.</p>
<p>(3) Kaya Okinori's visit to China is in a personal capacity and in the name of an old friend of the Party, as a visit and does not bear any diplomatic responsibility.</p>
<p>(4) The loan from Mitsui &amp; Co. is purely a rumor and is absolutely not true.</p>
<p>The meeting ended after the report, and it was already late at night.</p>

<h3>Chen Youren's Declaration on the Manchurian Problem</h3>
<p>Chen Youren, Minister of Foreign Affairs, issued a declaration on the Manchurian problem on the 1st, stating: "The flagrant challenge by the Japanese militarists to the resolutions of the League of Nations and the creation of the cruel war disaster in the three northeastern provinces are indeed a blatant challenge to the public opinion of today's civilized world. Now that the Chinese National Government has been reorganized, I hereby declare on behalf of the government that the most urgent task of this government is to eliminate the war disaster and protect sovereignty. I swear to uphold this purpose and strive to fight. The government has already ordered Zhang Xueliang to firmly defend Jinzhou and actively resist. In the future, it will continue to adhere to this purpose without the slightest change. Even if we unfortunately suffer a defeat, we will not take it into account. For a nation must have a place to stand in the world. Defeat in a just defense can arouse the hearts of the people and promote national morale. Defeat is also glorious. As for the brutal and unreasonable, even if they are lucky enough to win a temporary victory, they will in fact demean the character of their country, arouse the world's public anger, and will eventually become the target of all civilized countries, and there is no doubt about it." Chen Youren.</p>
<h3>National Government Celebrates New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Chairman Lin Stresses Unity in Saving the Nation</p>
<p>The National Government, facing both internal and external troubles last year, with the nation's vitality greatly weakened, held a simple celebration ceremony in the auditorium on New Year's Day of the Republic of China Year 21. All routine military parades, receptions for foreign guests, and banquets were canceled. Everything in the government was as usual, with no decorations except for the national flag hanging at the gate. The celebration ceremony was originally scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM, and government officials and guests from various agencies gathered in the auditorium on time. However, the inauguration ceremony was scheduled to continue immediately after the New Year's celebration, and the main officials to be inaugurated happened to be traveling to Shanghai, arriving in Beijing on the overnight train on New Year's Eve. Due to train delays, the celebration ceremony was delayed until noon at 12:00 PM. Those attending the ceremony included the newly appointed Chairman of the National Government Lin Sen, Committee members Kong Xiangxi, and the heads of various Yuan and ministries, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, and others, as well as government officials and guests, totaling more than 400 people. After the rituals, Chairman Lin gave a speech, saying, "Fellow comrades, today is New Year's Day of the Republic of China Year 21. In previous years, New Year's Day celebrations have been held, but this year, we are in a difficult national situation, with frequent external troubles. Therefore, today's ceremony is very simple, because now is the time for everyone to endure hardship and plan to overcome national difficulties. We can only remember the past celebrations in our hearts and no longer see them in form. This is the meaning of the government's decision to suspend all past celebrations on this New Year's Day. Today, looking back on the events of the past twenty years, everyone's responsibilities and work for the country have not been completely fulfilled. The ancients said, 'The plan for the year lies in the spring.' Today is the first day of the Republic of China Year 21. We should make an effort today to learn from the past and create a new path for the future. Therefore, I hope that everyone will start the year with a renewed spirit and take on the responsibility of building and saving the nation, working together to uphold the legacy of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and strive to guide the fate of the nation on a new path. This is the meaning of today's celebration." After the speech, the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul in Fuzhou Humiliates Our People</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Lodged a Serious Protest with the Japanese Ambassador.</p>
<p>[Beijing News] Students in Fuzhou clashed with the Japanese Consul and others stationed in Fuzhou on the 2nd due to their promotion of anti-Japanese activities. The Fujian Provincial Government has telegraphed a report to the Central Government. The telegram stated, "This afternoon (2nd), students from various schools held a recreational event in West Lake Park to promote anti-Japanese activities. The Japanese Consul stationed in Fuzhou and the captain and vice-captain of the Japanese warship 'Kitakami' went to the park and tore down the slogans posted at the recreational event on the spot. They also carried cameras and pistols, displaying various humiliating attitudes, which aroused public anger and led to a clash. The captain and vice-captain suffered minor injuries to their faces. Under the protection of the military police, the Consul and the captain and vice-captain were escorted to the City Security Bureau. Several hundred students followed them to the bureau and surrounded it for five or six hours, demanding the detention of the Consul and the captain and vice-captain, as well as the cameras, and requiring the Consul and others to write letters of repentance. Meanwhile, the government was conducting serious negotiations, etc. Currently, the crowd has moved from the Public Security Bureau to the Provincial Government to petition. The members of the committee and the garrison commander tried their best to persuade them, promising to submit the matter to the Central Government and ordering the military police to protect the Consul and the captain to arrive safely at the Japanese Consulate. It is confirmed that the Consul and others intentionally provoked the incident, and most of the crowd were underage students. Moreover, the Consul and the captain and vice-captain were in plain clothes, and it was unknown whether they were the Consul or the captain and vice-captain, leading to this unfortunate incident. It is earnestly requested that the Central Government lodge a serious protest with the Japanese Ambassador to calm public anger." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Ambassador after receiving the report.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Banditry During the Lunar New Year</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, around 12:00 AM, five bandits wearing gray clothes and leather belts broke into the residence of Shen Shaoqin, located south of the court in the city, through the back wall. They directly entered Shen's bedroom and tied up the couple with white cloth, ransacking the house. They stole a leather jacket, several cotton-padded clothes, thirty-seven yuan in cash, a watch, and a suitcase, escaping with the loot.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 3rd, several bandits came to the Yang family's farm in Yanggang Village, outside the West Gate's Jianggong Pavilion, attempting to rob them. However, they found no valuable clothes or jewelry. They then kidnapped the owner's son.</p>
<p>On the 26th of last month, Yang Shijie, an inspector from the County Public Security Bureau, along with detectives Tang Shuqin and others, went to the Punan area to investigate a theft case at the County Teachers' School. Around 10:00 PM on the 31st, they encountered a bandit boat at the Ganxiang Tangkou, at the border of Songjiang and Jinshan. They shouted for the boat to stop, but the bandits swam to the opposite bank and opened fire. Both sides exchanged fire in the dark for more than twenty minutes before the bandits scattered and fled. Hearing women crying for help from the bandit boat, they immediately boarded the boat and discovered that the two women, Pan Wu and Pan Lu, were kidnap victims from Baixu, Xiaokunshan. They also found eight mixed rounds of ammunition. It was reported that the bandits had demanded 8,000 yuan for Pan's ransom. They have now been sent to the Public Security Bureau, and their families have been ordered to take them back.</p>
<p>On the 2nd, the water patrol team received a report from fishermen at Fengjia Ferry in Huangpu that suspicious people had been staying in the temple overnight. They immediately went to capture Wang Ergou, who confessed that a dung boat would be transporting weapons westward tomorrow to carry out robberies, and that a bandit leader was staying behind to guard them. The team went to the address, and found a burly man. When the weapons-carrying boat approached, it saw the situation and immediately sailed away. The remaining bandits must be investigated and arrested. The name of the bandit leader is not yet released.</p>
<p>On the 3rd, the Songhu Pacification Command received an order from the Pacification Commissioner's Office to execute Wang Quanfa and Liu San, also known as Liu Rucai, two kidnappers in the Fanbangxinzhen case, by firing squad at the Yuhuang Reading Ground at 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau Arrests Five Bandits</p>
<p>Cai the Blind, a notorious bandit in Yangcheng Lake, gathered a gang to repeatedly rob Baixuan in Changshu, Dangkou in Wuxi, Chefang in Wuxian, and Weijingtang, among other places. The Department of Civil Affairs issued a warrant for his arrest and ordered the Public Security Bureau to seal his house.

<p>Chambers of Commerce from Various Counties Discuss Business Tax in Zhenjiang</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the business tax in Jiangsu Province, the collection has not improved. The Jiangsu Finance Department drafted thirteen rectification measures and submitted them to the Provincial Government for consideration and passage at the Provincial Committee meeting. These measures will be implemented this year. After the promulgation of these measures, merchants in various counties panicked, especially regarding the separate calculation of taxes for retail and wholesale, which is of utmost concern. In addition, issues such as the investigation of accounting books without consulting the Chamber of Commerce and changes in the revised regulations and detailed rules of the Ministry of Finance have led to numerous requests to the Chamber of Commerce for assistance. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a meeting on the 10th of this month to invite representatives from various county chambers of commerce to discuss the matter in Zhenjiang.</p>
<p>Ruishan Cocoon Warehouse Burned Down</p>
<p>Ruishan Silk Cocoon Warehouse, the second leather goods warehouse, located along the river under the Gongyun Bridge outside Guangfu Gate, accidentally caught fire at 1:30 AM on the 3rd. The wind was strong at the time, making it impossible to extinguish the fire. By the time the firefighters from various sections arrived, the sky was already red, and dried cocoons were flying into the sky. The fire was finally extinguished by dawn. The leather goods warehouse was completely burned down, with over six hundred dan of raw silk and four thousand eight hundred bags of dried cocoons stored inside, totaling a loss of more than 200,000 yuan, which can be described as a devastating catastrophe. It was also reported that when the fire was raging, burning dried cocoons flew to Renshou Lane, causing a fire in six workshops and spreading to the Shenjiang Hotel, Yu Yongxing Bamboo Shop, and several other shops, resulting in significant losses.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Financial Industry Rupture Situation</p>
<p>Since the collapse of the most famous money houses in Nantong, Deji and Yongchanglin, the debt loss is over two million yuan. Shanghai, Zhenjiang, and other ports are rushing to withdraw money from the money houses, and depositors are withdrawing cash at the same time, making it increasingly difficult to maintain the market. The Chamber of Commerce convened an emergency meeting on the 5th, but no results were achieved. It is difficult to form a joint guarantee by various money houses. Currently, various industries have suspended operations, and pawnshops have temporarily restricted the acceptance of items, only accepting two yuan per ticket due to unsmooth remittances.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Outside Wangdian, raising flags causes robbery case. Near Yangqi outside the Wangdian station in Jiaxing, a peddler from Taizhou named Tan who sells candied dates was walking from Xiashi to Wangdian for lodging late at night a few days ago. Four robbers ambushed him there, tied his arms behind his back, and stuffed his mouth with small stones from beside the railway track. They then robbed him of more than thirty silver dollars and the candied dates. Until the next morning, when a worker from the road maintenance crew caught sight of him, the peddler was on the verge of death. The worker immediately invited a doctor to provide medical assistance, and thankfully, he was revived. The local land and water police are currently investigating the case to apprehend the bandits.</p>

<h3>Many Changes in New Year's Ball Games</h3>
<p>| Liangjiang Wins the Western Youth Women's Basketball Championship |</p>
<p>| Donghua and Western Police Share the Right to Finals for the Scott Cup |</p>
<p>Jinan Ranks Second in Group A. The Lunar New Year has passed, the newspaper was suspended for five days, and there were countless ball games. The football circle considers the following to be important events during the five days: (1) Donghua and Western Police shared the right to the finals for the Scott Cup; (2) The Lincoln team still ranks first in the Westerners' Association Group A, while Jinan jumped to second; (3) Lehua won for the first time in the Group A competition, breaking the team's all-defeat record. As for the inter-port trial, it is still the first time, and there will be second and third times later. There have also been significant changes in the Western Youth Basketball Association. Hujiang defeated Mailing but lost to Pirates, so the hope for the championship has waned. Chizhi's defeat of Mailing was a shocking move. The championship of the Western Youth is likely to belong to the Pirates, but there may be issues, so it is not yet known. In the Western Youth Women's Basketball Tournament, Liangjiang had great fortune and their wish came true. They defeated the Rowing Club while Mailing lost to the Red Team, so Liangjiang ranked first. This is the first time for Chinese players to win the Western Youth Women's Basketball Championship, and it is arguably a great start to the year in Shanghai sports history.</p>
<p>(1) Excerpts from Important Matches</p>
<h3>Liangjiang Wins Women's Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team defeated the Rowing Club with a score of 26 to 11, winning the Western Youth Women's Basketball Championship and setting a new record for Chinese women in Shanghai. Liangjiang led all the way, while the Rowing Club repeatedly missed throws, resulting in a major defeat. In the performance, Liangjiang was slightly inferior, with forward Wan Rong逊色 and the Rowing Club's tall players making defense difficult for the guards. As a result, Liangjiang won the first half with a score of 13 to 8, and the total score was 26 to 11. The Red Team lost to Mailing with a score of 37 to 22. Mailing's veteran Mrs.克利生 returned, so the Red Team lost, which was also Liangjiang's good fortune. This is the third Western Youth Women's Basketball tournament. Western Youth won the first tournament, Mailing won the previous one, and Liangjiang won this one. The results of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Liangjiang won 6 times and lost once (5) Qingjia won 4 times and lost 3 times (2) Red Team won 5 times and lost twice (6) Junior won twice and lost 5 times (3) Rowing won 5 times and lost twice (7) Basketball won once and lost 6 times (4) Mailing won 5 times and lost twice (8) Qingyi won 0 times and lost 7 times</p>
<h3>Strong Opponents Meet in Western Youth Basketball</h3>
<p>(Hujiang Defeats Mailing) The five players of Hujiang had consistent offense and defense, leading all the way with a difference of up to six points. In the first half, Mailing only lost by two points, 21 to 19. In the second half, Hujiang played even better, and Mailing closely followed but could not catch up. As a result, Hujiang won by three points with a score of 34 to 31. (Chizhi Defeats Mailing) Chizhi also led all the way in their victory over Mailing. In the first half, the score was 12 to 10. In the second half, Chizhi suddenly moved out with a score of 17 to 12, and the competition was still fierce, with the score difference being at least one point. In the end, the score was 28 to 25. In the last minute, Mailing scored one point on a penalty, making the score 28 to 26. Mailing has lost twice in a row, and their hopes have been dashed. (Pirates Defeats Hujiang) The battle between Hujiang and Pirates was nothing short of a championship decider. The audience was packed. Hujiang's loss was a great pity. In the first half, Hujiang won by one point with a score of 16 to 15. Hujiang's zone defense was very tight, and Pirates had no way to attack. In the second half, Pirates replaced Haynes with Sullivan, and Hujiang changed their strategy to man-to-man defense, which led to their failure. In the end, Pirates won with a score of 34 to 29. Pirates' championship will be determined after their matches with St. John's and Mailing.</p>
<h3>Results of the First Inter-Port Trial Match</h3>
<p>The first inter-port trial match was held at the Chinese baseball field on New Year's Day. The Helei team aimed to attack, and wingers Chen Zhenhe and Jikehan, as well as center Huisi Fulun, showed their lifelong skills, winning the praise of the entire audience. The goalkeeper of the Stoke team, Zhou Xianyan, and the inner guards Stoke and Li Ning, were all very competent, but unfortunately, the central defensive line was disorganized and could not withstand the attack, leading to defeat. The score was 2 to 0 in the first half, and the final result was 9 to 0 in favor of the Helei team. The scorers were Huisi Fulun with 6 goals, Molai with 2 goals, and Dai Linjing with 1 goal.</p>
<h3>Jinan Wins 8 to 1 Against Lehua</h3>
<p>The match between Jinan and Lehua on the 2nd at Yiyuan was a scene from the Group A competition. At the beginning, Lehua Wuxianghua scored the first goal. Afterwards, Jinan launched a large-scale offensive, but Lehua's efforts to resist were ineffective. The score was 3 to 1 in the first half, and the final result was 8 to 1 in favor of Jinan. With this victory, Jinan rose to second place in the Westerners' Association Group A. The scorers for Jinan were Chen Zhenhe with 4 goals, Qiu Dongyan with 1 goal, Wen Dingxin with 1 goal, Mei Hongbao with 1 goal, and Long Liwen with 1 goal.</p>
<h3>Donghua and Western Police Get the Right to the Finals</h3>
<p>In the Scott Cup semi-final, Donghua defeated Lax 4 to 2 on the 3rd, and Western Police defeated Scott 2 to 1 on the 2nd, gaining the right to the finals. Donghua defeated Lax in the first half with a score of 2 to 0. In the second half, the score was 2 to 2, and the final result was 4 to 2 in favor of Donghua. The scorers for Donghua were Dai Linjing with 2 goals, Chen Hongguang with 1 goal, and Tu Kaiyuan with 1 goal. The scorers for Lax were Back with 2 goals. The victory of the Western Police over Scott was somewhat lucky. Their veteran Helei Jack was not present, and he was hit by the center Brandt of the Scott team in the first half. Fortunately, Faras and Wilkinson each scored one goal in the second half, reversing the defeat with a score of 2 to 1.</p>
<h3>Lehua Breaks the All-Defeat Record</h3>
<p>Lehua has been improving recently, and yesterday they broke their team's all-defeat record and defeated the British Navy Cornwall with a score of 7 to 1. At the beginning of the match, Lehua was scored on by the enemy, but after this, Lehua made a strong response. The score was 3 to 1 in favor in the first half, and the final result was 7 to 1 in favor. The scorers were Wan Xianghua with 2 goals, Jiang Chao with 2 goals, Yang Renwei with 1 goal, Zhou Shaowen with 1 goal, and Sun Huipai with 1 goal.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Elders and Others Oppose Diplomatic Compromise</h3>
<p>Jiangsu National Crisis Council, Ma Liang and others, send a telegram: "To the national citizens and all public organizations for your review. We recently telegraphed the National Government stating that the violent Japanese are violating their promise to withdraw troops and are relentlessly advancing. Zhang Xueliang has unilaterally withdrawn defenses, Jinzhou is undefended, and Japanese troops are approaching Shanhaiguan. Rumors abound of secret envoys traveling between the government and Japan to conduct compromises. If there are any agreements that harm territorial sovereignty and impede administrative integrity, our citizens vow not to recognize them," and so on.

<h3>Guangzhou National Government's Cancellation Declaration Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Contains references to the Southwestern Executive Department, etc.</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Telegrams Guangdong Inquiring About Truth</p>
<p>Tang Shaoyi and others send a telegram to Wang Jingwei: "Wang Member Jingwei Xun Jian, Today, we issued the following declaration: Since the party launched the Northern Expedition in the 14th year, through a long period of struggle and the support of the people, we were able to eliminate the warlords in the 17th year and unify the country. We hoped to follow the teachings of the late Premier, implement political tutelage, and establish the foundation of democracy, returning political power to the people as soon as possible. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this undertaking, the political system was not fully perfected, and its operation lost its balance, leading to the formation of individual dictatorship, and the spirit of democracy disappeared day by day. We, deeply concerned about the collapse of the great cause and the peril of the nation, gathered in Guangzhou to organize an extraordinary meeting of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, resulting in the establishment of a National Government. From the very beginning, we declared to the nation that our aim was to eliminate the evils of individual dictatorship and establish a foundation for democratic politics, and we have strived day and night to realize the goal of achieving unification through construction and seeking common governance through power balance. Later, a powerful neighbor took advantage of the opportunity to occupy our eastern border. We believed that, in this situation, unification was essential to resist foreign aggression and save the country. The Nanjing side also expressed peaceful intentions. Therefore, on the Ma and Ma days, we sent telegrams stating that if Comrade Jiang Zhongzheng resigns and a unified government is formed through a unification conference, then the current National Government in Guangzhou can be abolished. Fortunately, the Shanghai Peace Conference has been successfully concluded, and the Fourth National Congress has also completed its mission. Comrade Jiang Zhongzheng has been able to reluctantly comply with the expectations of the people and resign. The unified government has been established in Nanjing today. This council and this government are fulfilling their previous promises and abolishing themselves on the same day. From now on, party power will be unified in the central government, and administrative power will be returned to the unified government. Furthermore, in accordance with the resolutions of the Fourth National Congress, a Southwestern Executive Department of the Central Executive Committee, a Southwestern Political Affairs Committee, and a Southwestern Military Branch will be established to bear the responsibility of balanced power and joint governance, striving to suppress the communist bandits, consolidate national defense, and carry out various political tasks during the period of political tutelage, while promoting the development of local party affairs and the clarification of politics. The duties of us and others are hereby discharged. May all comrades and the people share the same virtue and heart, jointly face the national crisis, and contribute their humble efforts to the party and the country. This is our declaration. Tang Shaoyi, Hu Hanmin, Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Deng Zeru, Xiao Focheng, Chen Jitang, Xu Chongzhi, Li Zongren, Wu Chaoshu, Chen Bijun, Zou Lu, Li Wenfan, Ju Zheng, Xie Chi, Bai Chongxi, Xiong Kewu, Chen Youren, Tang Shengzhi, Shi Qingyang, Qin Zhen, Jing Hengyi, Chen Ce, Zhang Huichang, Ma Chaojun, Liu Jiwen, Fu Rulin, Chen Shuren, Deng Qingyang, Lin Yun, Chen Yaoyuan, Jiao Yitang, Zhang Zhiben, Gui Chongji, Gu Mengyu, Li Fulin, Guo Chuntao, Zhao Pilian, Bai Yunti, Zhang Fakui, Yu Hanmou, Li Yangjing, Lin Yizhong, Xiang Hanping, Qu Fangpu, Huang Xuchu, Cheng Tiangu, Huang Jilu, Liang Hancao, Guan Suren, Li Renren, Zeng Zhongming, Cui Guangxiu, Huang Fusheng, Zhang Dingfan, Lin Zhimian, Miao Peinan, Li Qian, Chen Zhongfu, Zhan Jusi Dong. According to our reporter, after receiving the telegram from Guangzhou Dongri, he immediately went to Wang's residence to inquire about the truth. According to Wang's secretary's office, after Mr. Wang and others received this telegram, because there were terms such as the establishment of the Southwest Executive Department, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, and the Southwest Military Branch in the telegram, they had not heard about this matter and had not slightly taken consent for this telegram. Therefore, they immediately telegraphed Guangzhou to inquire about the origin and content of the matter."</p>
<h3>Last Year's Customs and Salt Taxes Were Bumper Harvests</h3>
<p>Customs Duties: 248 Million Taels</p>
<p>Salt Tax: 165 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Customs Duties: "The North China Daily News" reports that, according to reliable sources, China's customs revenue last year was approximately 248 million taels of customs silver, an increase of approximately 8 million taels compared to the estimated 240 million taels, which is a very gratifying result. The detailed figures will be released in a few days.</p>
<p>Salt Tax: According to the most reliable sources, last year's prosperous collection of salt tax was unprecedented. The amount collected by the Inspectorate reached 165 million yuan. Since the establishment of the Inspectorate in the second year of the Republic of China, tax revenue has improved annually. From the second year to the nineteenth year, the average annual income was 80 million yuan. From the seventeenth to the nineteenth year, the average income for three years was 127 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Huang Hanliang Receives Shanghai Financial Circles</h3>
<p>Adopting Openness and Transparency as Guiding Principles</p>
<p>Using Fiscal Transparency as a Fundamental Principle</p>
<p>The newly appointed Minister of Finance, Mr. Huang Hanliang, held a reception for Shanghai's financial circles at the Jin Cheng Bank on the fourth day of the month. Those who attended included Zhang Gongquan, Chen Guangfu, Li Fuxun, Hu Mengjia, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Jiliang, Wu Yunzi, Ye Fuxiao, and Lin Kanghou, among dozens of others. Mr. Huang reported that the new government will adopt openness and transparency as its guiding principles, with fiscal transparency as a fundamental principle, and hoped for the support of colleagues in the financial circles. His speech was roughly as follows: "I am very honored to have all of you here today. Now that the new government has been established, the guiding principles of governance are to be open and transparent, especially fiscal transparency. Since the establishment of the Republic of China twenty years ago, internal strife has been frequent. The reasons are complex, but the lack of fiscal transparency is a major one. The new government advocates openness in everything, not only can all policies be made public, but also the use of personnel in institutions should be based on openness. This time, I am in charge of finance, and I know that my knowledge and experience are difficult to meet the requirements. However, due to the current national crisis and my long-standing friendship with President Sun, I dare not refuse despite knowing the difficulties. I am now willing to do my best in accordance with the spirit of openness of the new government, and everything will be handled in accordance with the resolutions of the Finance Committee. Most of the members of the Finance Committee are national financial and industrial leaders and economic experts, which is tantamount to representing the national public opinion in handling national finances. However, I am incompetent and responsible, and I am always on thin ice. I hope that you will do your best to help. I was originally a member of the financial community, and I deeply understand the suffering of the financial community. Now that diplomacy is urgent and the national crisis is imminent, there is only one way for the government and the financial community to treat each other with sincerity, and everyone should do their best, cooperate with each other, and help each other. I also hope that you will guide me at any time in all my financial measures," and so on. Next, Zhang Gongquan, Qian Xinzhi, Lin Kanghou and others successively made speeches, expressing their willingness to cooperate with the government to overcome the difficulties of the times together and disperse. The following is the text of Huang's inaugural declaration.</p>
<p>"Hanliang, with my meager talent, has been temporarily entrusted with managing the treasury. I could not decline the order, so I reluctantly accepted the position. However, for several years, internal strife has been frequent, and nine out of ten of the national revenue has been consumed by military expenses, resulting in an ever-increasing amount of domestic debt, with almost all assets mortgaged and all resources exhausted. The financial difficulties have reached an extreme point. Now that the national crisis is extremely urgent, it is even more difficult to take action. Hanliang has received a special appointment, and it is my duty to do my best to plan the reorganization of the national finances for the country and to plan the security of the national economy for the people. As far as I can see, there are about six points: ⑴ In the old days, the national finances were inevitably exhausted to meet the urgent needs of military expenditure due to the unending military campaigns. Managing finances for military affairs is not managing finances for civil administration. As a result, tax sources are exhausted, industries are withered, and the people's livelihood is in dire straits. It is impossible to end the day. The key to changing the situation lies in making fiscal policies and economic policies echo each other, so that both national economy and people's livelihood can be taken care of at the same time. As for government revenue, every drop is the people's fat and cream. In the future, we must gradually increase construction expenditure, while military expenditure will be limited to national defense and bandit suppression. Gathering money and borrowing money to supply internal wars is not something that a government that aspires to unify China through peace dares to do. ⑵ Democratic politics takes the implementation of budgets and final accounts as the key to matching national income and expenditure. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, there have been either budgets without final accounts, or even budgets without them. Fiscal transparency is just empty talk, and the lack of national credibility is entirely due to this. Now that our government has made promoting democracy an unwavering policy, fiscal accounting should be thoroughly open, and the audit system should also be strictly implemented. ⑶ National expenditure has been too inflated in recent years, and the people's strength has already shown signs of being unable to bear the burden. If we do not plan for this, the national finances will inevitably fall into the hopeless situation of bankruptcy. In the future, the government should make every effort to economize on military and political expenditures, and eliminate redundant personnel and merge redundant institutions as far as possible, so that fiscal policies can adapt to the people's strength and live within our means. ⑷ Our country's tax system has always lacked a system, and there are many inequalities. To improve it, we should take organizing old taxes as the first step and promoting new taxes as the second step. While increasing revenue, we still intend to cultivate tax sources, and the scientific management of tax administration is the fundamental key to revitalizing financial administration. Only when financial institutions can implement scientific management can they actually verify the facts and return every drop to the public. ⑸ National debt credit is related to the lifeline of finance and also to international perception. The funds of each debt should be effectively maintained to protect finance and consolidate debt credit. The Central Bank is the central hub of national finance, and its independent status should be maintained to ensure financial security and consolidate the foundation of finance. ⑹ Gathering ideas and benefiting widely is the clear instruction of the sages. Fiscal problems are deeply related to the national economy. Discussion and research should not be too detailed. We are now planning to invite domestic industrial and financial leaders and financial and economic experts to participate in the organization of the Finance Committee. Important policies or measures should be submitted for discussion and consultation to seek common advice and harmony to overcome national difficulties. The above is just a rough outline of what Hanliang has felt. The rope is short to draw from the depths, and I am always on thin ice. This is a major matter, and it depends on concentrating national talents, coordinating fiscal construction, and sharing national difficulties. I am willing to hear your clear teachings on my humble efforts."</p>
<h3>University Federation Indignant Over Loss of Jinzhou</h3>
<p>Telegrams Government Presenting Three Points</p>
<p>Telling Compatriots to Rise Up Quickly</p>
<p>Shanghai News: The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Federation of students from various universities in this city was extremely indignant after hearing the news of the fall of Jinzhou. Yesterday, it issued a statement to compatriots and telegraphed various parties, urging the government to send troops to recover the lost territory. The original text is recorded below, divided as follows:</p>
<h3>Statement to Compatriots</h3>
<p>National compatriots, public assessment: The government's responsibility is to protect the country and the people. The military's duty is to defend the territory. For several months, Liaoning and Jilin have been occupied first, and Heilongjiang Province has been lost later. The military considers retreat to be a good strategy, and the government appeases with calm and delays with League of Nations mediation and Ning-Yue unification. Now that unification is complete, diplomacy still has no direction, and war preparation is still absent. The means of deceiving the people are the same as before. The recent withdrawal and loss of Jinzhou is clear evidence of this. In short, neither the old nor the new government has a heart. Otherwise, why should the emergency peace conference at this critical moment of life and death last for as long as three months, and the result is still no solution, resulting in today's precarious situation? Although it is done, who is responsible for it? The people are the main body of the country, and the government is the agency entrusted by the people. All other rights can be deprived, but the people's right to life and self-defense cannot be deprived by the government. At this time, if we do not rise up quickly to urge the government, I fear that after the country is lost and the family is destroyed in an instant, there will be no regrets. We have seen this, and today we have telegraphed the government on three matters: (1) Withdraw from the League of Nations; (2) Send troops to recover the lost territory and order the northern soldiers not to receive Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance order and automatically resist Japan; (3) Execute Zhang Xueliang, the official who lost territory and humiliated the country. The above three points must be implemented by the government within three days. Otherwise, it is tantamount to admitting that it is willing to betray the country. We will resolutely oppose it to the death. However, students are a small part of the people, and their strength is naturally weak. We hope that compatriots across the country will share the same heart for national salvation and unanimously advocate it to show the power of our people and eliminate the traitorous intentions of those in power. If so, there may be a glimmer of hope for our country's future. Otherwise, if we still ignore it, the consequences of national destruction and extinction will be unimaginable. Instead of waiting until it is too late, why not take precautions? The ancients said, "United we stand," and I hope you will pay attention to it. I respectfully report this."</p>
<h3>Telegram to the National Government</h3>
<p>To the Nanjing National Government: Since the September 18th Incident, the military has retreated to prolong its life, and the government has deceived the people with calm. First, it said that the government has a final determination, and then it said that it is waiting for the League of Nations to mediate, but the violence of Japan has only increased, resulting in the loss of Heilongjiang Province on November 20. Since the League of Nations resolution has no effect, the government should implement its final determination to send troops to recover the lost territory. However, it still adheres to the policy of calm and non-resistance, and even uses the excuse of waiting for Ning-Yue unification before launching a unified attack on Japan. Since the peace conference was opened to deal with the urgent foreign crisis, both sides should sacrifice everything, be open and honest, and complete the meeting within a few days to relieve the suffering of the northeastern compatriots and fight for the sovereignty of the Republic of China in order to live up to the expectations of the people. However, both sides are stubbornly arguing about right and wrong, fighting for power and dividing spoils, only knowing how to be promoted and make money, and ignoring the national crisis and the people's suffering, resulting in the so-called peace conference that deceives the people being delayed for three months and barely concluded. If either side or one side had a little conscience and took the national crisis as the premise and made concessions, then unification would not be difficult to achieve early. Even now, unification has a government that should strive to correct its past mistakes and replay a new situation in order to live up to its responsibility. However, it still relies on the League of Nations, the imperialist organ for dividing spoils, and only orders Zhang Xueliang to be responsible for defending the territory and strive for resistance. As for how to make Zhang use his life and how to assist Zhang, there are no concrete measures, resulting in Jinzhou being lost again by retreat. Jinzhou is the screen of North China. If Jinzhou is lost, Tianjin and Beijing are in danger. If Tianjin and Beijing are in danger, the overall situation will move, and the consequences will be unimaginable. The national situation is so critical that we cannot bear to sit idly by. Moreover, the survival of the country is related to the life and death of the people. If the country survives, it is already good. Once the country is lost, the pain of national destruction can be borne by others. The most painful thing in the world is to be a slave to a lost country. We have sent a telegram to (1) withdraw from the League of Nations; (2) send troops to recover the lost territory, and order the northern generals and soldiers not to receive Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance order and automatically resist Japan; (3) Execute Zhang Xueliang, the official who lost power and humiliated the country. The above three points must be implemented by the government within three days. Otherwise, it is tantamount to admitting that it is a government that is willing to betray the country. 100,000 students at sea will follow the pre-arranged plan for the sake of national salvation, striving to deal with this numb and unfeeling government. I respectfully report this."</p>
<h3>Telegram to Director Zhang of Beiping</h3>
<p>To Director Zhang of Beiping: You, as the highest military officer in the Northeast, have failed to fulfill your military duty to defend the territory, resulting in Liaoning and Jilin being occupied without resistance, and Heilongjiang Province being lost without assistance. Recently, Jinzhou, the screen of our North, has also fallen due to the withdrawal of troops. What are you thinking? You do not hesitate to make mistakes again and again, losing territory and humiliating the country to this extent. You also know that China is the China of 400 million people, not your China alone. The three northeastern provinces are the three northeastern provinces of 400 million people, not your three northeastern provinces alone. In peacetime, the rights of the Northeast can be controlled by you alone, but now the suffering of the northeastern compatriots who have lost their country cannot be borne by you alone. Not only do you not try to resist the enemy desperately, but you also enjoy yourself and disregard the northeastern compatriots who are in dire straits. Moreover, the Northeast is your hometown. Your ancestors' graves are there, your ancestral shrines are there, your fields and houses are there, and your elders, brothers, aunts, and sisters are all there. You have lived there, eaten there, and lived there for decades. Your father's death the year before last was caused by the Japanese bombing. The Japanese are both publicly and privately enemies to you. Now you have ruined the Northeast, which is called disloyalty. You have not avenged your father's death, which is called unfilial piety. Disloyalty and unfilial piety are called scum, which our people should abandon together. A man has a seven-foot body, and he cannot serve the country on the battlefield and defend the country. Instead, he acts perversely. What personality can he speak of? Even if he steals a moment of rest, how can he face the world? How can he see the elders of the Northeast? How can he see your father in death? Moreover, there is more than enough death, and what is the point of living? For you, it is only right to wake up in time and fight to the death with Japan. If you win, you can atone for your sins. If you lose and die, you will not lose your life as a hero. Otherwise, you should know your guilt and commit suicide to apologize to the people of the country. I have exhausted my words, and I hope you will consider them. I respectfully report this."</p>
<h3>Statement to Northern Generals and Soldiers</h3>
<p>To all generals and soldiers in the north: A soldier's duty is to defend the territory. It has been 21 years since the founding of the Republic of China. In these 21 years, except for the slight conflict with Russia before, there has been nothing but warlord melee, fighting each other and killing each other, using generals and soldiers as tools for them to seize territory, be promoted and make a fortune. The safety of the country and the suffering of the people are all put aside. Therefore, on September 18th, the violent Japanese took the opportunity to seize our Liaoning and Jilin, followed by the loss of Heilongjiang Province. Recently, Jinzhou has also fallen, and Zhang Xueliang, the military officer in the Northeast, has retreated again and again, trying to preserve his strength for the purpose of consolidating his own position internally, regarding the country's territory and the people's lives as weeds. His numbness and insensitivity are so great. At this critical moment of survival, Zhang is willing to betray the country, and the government has no concrete measures. Zhang's non-resistance is a traitor, and obeying his non-resistance order is also a traitor. If a man has a little blood, how can he be willing to be a traitor? If there is one, it must be a dead end, like Zhang Haipeng and Pu Wei's plan. Can the northern generals and soldiers who have always been loyal, brave, simple, and rustic be such people? We hope that you will rise up in time and automatically resist Japan. You will not receive the order to betray the country, no matter who issues it, whether it is Zhang or the government. We will not only reject Zhang's order to betray the country, but also actively overthrow him to eliminate harm for the people. A man should defend the country and die on the battlefield, bringing glory to the nation. How can he steal a life in the world and delay the country? General Ma Zhanshan fought bravely in Heilongjiang Province with a small force, risking his life to kill the enemy and achieve success, venting his anger for our Chinese nation. The northern generals and soldiers are like clouds, and strategists are like rain. It is not difficult to compete with the Eastern barbarians. We ordinary people will provide the same support to the northern generals and soldiers as we do to General Ma, and we will reward the northern generals and soldiers as we do to General Ma. The ancients said, "Where there is a will, there is a way." May our northern generals and soldiers work hard! I respectfully report this."</p>
<h3>Baoshan National Crisis Council Advocates Severely Punishing Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County National Crisis Relief Association sends a telegram: "Urgent to the Shanghai Jiangsu Provincial National Crisis Relief Association to forward to the National National Crisis Relief Association, Nanjing National Government: Zhang Xueliang previously lost Liaoning, Ning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang due to non-resistance, and the whole country was angry. Now, when the Japanese army attacked Jinzhou, he withdrew all the troops stationed in Jinzhou into the customs and abandoned Jinzhou. Can the country's territory be entrusted, and the troops under his command are unwilling to sacrifice even slightly? The country raises soldiers to defend the country. If the country's territory is not defended, what is the intention? Please remove Zhang Xueliang from his post and severely punish him to thank the people and rectify military administration." Yuan Xiluo and 30 others from the Baoshan County National Crisis Relief Association kowtow.</p>

<p>New Mayor Wu Tiecheng (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<h3>Sending Personnel to Oversee Oath</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu will take the oath of office at 10:00 am today. The Central Government has decided to send Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, as the supervisor, and the National Government has sent Kong Xiangxi as the supervisor. The city government issued a special order to its subordinate bureaus and affiliated agencies, instructing them to send representatives to participate in the oath-taking ceremony of the new mayor today.</p>
<h3>Old Personnel's Stay or Leave</h3>
<p>Since Mayor Zhang resigned, all senior officials in the city government, such as Secretary General Yu Hongjun, counselors Zhou Liangcai, Sun Baorong, secretaries Guo 　, Geng Jiaji, Feng Fei, and chiefs of the first section Qi Xuan, the second section Luo Jingyou, and the third section Shen Ruji and other nine people, jointly submitted a request to Mayor Zhang for approval to resign. Mr. Wu Tiecheng asked Mayor Zhang to persuade them to stay, but the officials were determined to resign, so yesterday he approved the retention of Yu Hongjun and Luo Jingyou, and approved the resignation of the rest. As for the remaining staff, Mr. Wu may re-employ them after taking office today. All the officials who have been approved to resign will stop going to the city government to handle handover procedures from today, and the procedures have been completely completed yesterday, waiting for the handover today.</p>
<h3>Wu's Brief History</h3>
<p>Wu Tiecheng is 44 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong. He has served as a member of the Central Committee for the second, third, and fourth terms. He has served as the director of the Guangdong Provincial Police Department, the commander of the Guangzhou Independent Division, the director of the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, and the county magistrate of Xiangshan County, Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Responsible Talk</h3>
<p>At 3:00 pm on January 4th, reporters from various newspapers had a ten-minute talk with Mr. Wang Jingwei at the German Hospital. The following is recorded as follows: Question: What are your thoughts on the First Plenary Session? Answer: This First Plenary Session was very able to express the spirit of unity. I very much hope to get good results. Question: After you recover from your illness, will you enter Nanjing? Answer: After I recover from my illness, I will enter Nanjing to support my comrades in carrying out everything. Question: After you enter Beijing, can you serve as a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Political Council? Answer: Since I have been elected by the First Plenary Session, I cannot refuse. However, the Standing Committee is assumed to be assumed by Mr. Jiang and Mr. Chun and myself, so it can only be organized and established when Mr. Jiang and Mr. Hu enter Beijing. Can Mr. Jiang and Mr. Hu enter Beijing? Answer: I am extremely eager for Mr. Jiang and Mr. Hu to enter Beijing as soon as possible. Question: I heard that there has been brewing for separatist rule in various provinces recently. What are your thoughts on this? Answer: Seeking unification through construction and seeking common governance through balanced power has always been my proposition. To achieve this proposition, we must follow the principles set in the Founding Program to divide the powers between the central government and local governments. The detailed articles of the Taiyuan Convention draft have been revised. Although I dare not say that it is perfect, it is generally feasible. If we abandon this and seek separatist rule, it is undoubtedly an obstacle to the future of democratic politics. I will do my best to oppose it and prevent it from happening. Question: How is the National Salvation Conference that you initiated progressing? Answer: It has been handed over to the Central Standing Committee by the First Plenary Session. Although I am sick, my comrades will still do their best to carry it out. Question: Can the above talks be used as your responsible statement? Answer: I would like to.</p>
<h3>Two Groups Welcome Feng Yuxiang</h3>
<p>Supporting Mr. Feng's Leadership in the People's Resistance Against Japan: The Five Southeast Provinces' People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, the Chinese Kuomintang Party Protection Comrades Association, and other groups, initiated a grand meeting to welcome Mr. Feng Huanzhang's leadership in the people's resistance against Japan, held on New Year's Day at the public sports ground. Over ten thousand people attended, each receiving a badge. Around 1:00 PM, the presidium of the meeting dispatched Ni Zhihuang and Zhou Yangzhao to greet Mr. Feng. At 1:30 PM, Mr. Feng arrived, met with applause from the crowd and salutes from the military and police. The master of ceremonies, Qian Kangmin, nominated Ni Yibao, Zhou Zishi, Huang Huazhou, Jin Luwang, Ni Zhihuang, Wang Yaodong, Zhou Yangzhao, Guan Yunqiu, Ji Shiyuan, Zhu Jiaji, Zheng Binggang, Zhang Xuechao, Tan Henghua, Zhang Junguang, and Liang Shu , fifteen people to form the presidium. After taking their seats, they performed the ceremonial rituals. Huang Huazhou delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the assembly. Ni Yibao and Zheng Binggang delivered welcoming speeches on behalf of the Five Southeast Provinces' People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, briefly stating: "We welcome Mr. Feng because he has revolutionary achievements and can be approachable. We support his position as chairman of armed recovery of lost territories, and we believe he can definitely achieve it. Currently, resistance against Japan requires the use of force. We should unanimously support Mr. Feng in leading our national people's armed resistance against Japan." Then, representatives from various organizations successively delivered speeches.

<h3>New Developments at the Central Bank</h3>

<h3>Recent News from the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that the Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association previously received a confidential report stating that Jingcheng Silk Shop on Wufu Street was fraudulently passing off Japanese goods, 人字叽, as domestic products from the Qincheng Factory using the "Five Old Men" trademark, and packaging them into parcels for sale to various ports. The association immediately dispatched investigators who discovered 146 bolts of 人字叽 on the spot, one-fifth of which had been converted with the "Five Old Men" trademark. The investigators monitored the shop to prevent the goods from being moved, and brought the trademarks back to the association for inspection. The association and the inspection department transferred the goods to the Zhabei storage office for safekeeping and further investigation. The association believes that at a time when the violent Japanese are increasingly aggressive, Jingcheng Shop is seeking selfish gains, disregarding the nation's great crisis, and privately selling enemy goods, deceiving fellow countrymen, which is extremely hateful. In addition to confiscating these goods, the association has announced to all sectors the circumstances of Jingcheng Shop fraudulently repackaging and privately selling goods, hoping that all merchants will pay attention to the counterfeit goods with the "Five Old Men" trademark. Furthermore, the association found that Yuyuanheng Cloth Shop on Jixiang Street, Avenue du Docteur Sun Yat-sen, had purchased a large batch of Japanese goods after September 21st, but the person in charge of the shop refused to come forward, so there was no way to investigate. The association believes that the shop is disregarding public opinion, undermining the anti-Japanese stance, and showing no remorse, intending to evade responsibility. If sanctions are not imposed, what will be the effect of anti-Japanese efforts? Therefore, all sectors are notified to jointly boycott the shop's conduct.</p>

<h3>Two Kidnapping Cases</h3>
<p>One Involving an Elementary School Student</p>
<p>One Involving a Broker</p>
<p>Gu Zizhen, a Yunnan native who previously served as a division commander in Guangdong, came to Shanghai as a resident after being dismissed from his position two years ago. His family lives in a Western-style house at No. 95 Rue Massenet in the French Concession. Gu has a son named Zelin, who is five years old and currently studies in the primary class of Qinyie Girls' Middle School at No. 8 Xiai Lane, Route Gustare de Saix. Because he is very young, he is accompanied to school every day by a nanny in a car, and this has never changed. Yesterday morning, Gu Zelin and his nanny were sent to school in their own car, number 2757. Around 11:00 AM, while the nanny and Zelin were sunbathing next to the classroom, a black sedan suddenly drove up to the school gate and stopped at the neighboring Sino-French School at No. 7. Three kidnappers wearing yellow gowns and long black robes jumped out of the car and rushed straight into the classroom. Upon seeing Gu Zelin, they drew their guns. One kidnapper snatched Gu Zelin from the nanny's arms, carried him out the door, and shoved him into the car. The driver accelerated towards Route Cardinal Mercier and sped away, disappearing in an instant. At that time, people from the entire school heard the alarm and rushed to the gate, only to see that the kidnappers' car number was 7704. However, it is not yet known whether this number is real or fake. After the incident, the school principal, Ms. Zhu Jianxia, turned pale and immediately accompanied Gu's nanny to Gu's residence to report the incident. Then, Gu's family sent people to report to the police, who notified the various districts and sections of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the various police stations of the Public Concession to pay attention to intercepting the kidnappers.</p>
<p>Wang Qingquan, a local Shanghai resident, is 52 years old. His wife, Gu, is 47 years old. They have two sons and two daughters. The eldest son, Longsheng, is 16 years old and currently studies at Nanyang Middle School. The younger son, Taosheng, is only 4 years old. The eldest daughter, Fengbao, is 19 years old, and the younger daughter, Shunbao, is 13 years old. Wang uses a hired car for transportation, and the chauffeur, Jiang Jinsheng, is from Tongzhou and has been serving in the Wang family for over seven years. The Wang family also has two maids. Wang has always been involved in the cotton industry and has been very successful over the years due to his diligence and thrift. He has considerable savings at home. Recently, he has been working as Broker No. 2 in the yarn and cloth exchange and built a grand residence at No. 40 Luzi Street in the South City. Every day around 8:00 AM, Wang would ride in his hired car to the yarn and cloth exchange on Avenue Edward VII in the North City to handle all affairs, which was his usual routine. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, Wang followed his usual routine and rode in his hired car to the exchange. As the chauffeur Jiang Jinsheng pulled the car to the Xiaozha Bridge Street outside the Xiaonanmen, two men suddenly appeared, wearing black robes, and blocked the way. They brandished guns, ordered them to stop, and warned them not to make a sound. Knowing that he had encountered bandits, Wang said, "If you want money, you can say so, why do you have to do this?" The bandits claimed, "Is your last name Liu?" Wang said, "My last name is Wang, not Liu. You must have mistaken me." At that time, a blue painted car with a white license plate number of 17541 suddenly approached Wang's hired car and stopped immediately. Without saying anything, the two bandits immediately pulled Wang out of the hired car, pushed him into the car, and sped away. The chauffeur Jiang Jinsheng, seeing that his master had been kidnapped, was terrified and stunned. After a while, he returned home to report the incident.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Cracked in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Apprentice Mistaken for Young Master</p>
<p>Greatly Frightened After Being Kidnapped</p>
<p>Resisted Capture in Taihu Lake</p>
<p>Dead Bandit压 On Top of Hostage</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team arrested a bandit ship at Pu Mian, Maojia Lane, South City at around 12:00 AM on the 5th (the previous day), arrested six kidnappers on the spot, and rescued a hostage. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Apprentice Mistakenly Kidnapped: In Wangting Xin'an, about sixty miles from Suzhou, there is a large-scale dried goods shop. The shop owner, Sui Chu, named the shop "Zou Shuntai". The shop has been quite prosperous in its operations. At around 9:00 PM on the evening of December 29th of last year, just as the shop was closing, five or six bandits suddenly rushed into the store, brandishing guns and warning everyone not to make a sound. They claimed that they needed to speak with the shop's young master. At that time, everyone in the shop looked at each other in dismay and remained silent. The bandits, becoming impatient, began to search. Unexpectedly, one of the shop's employees, Yao Qibao, a native of Jiangyin, who was 23 years old, looked quite similar to the shop's young boss. The bandits, without further investigation, rashly kidnapped Yao and left.</p>
<p>Resisting Arrest in Taihu Lake: After kidnapping Yao, the bandits hid him in a small sand boat and sailed south at full speed. The next day, as the ship passed Yangcheng Lake and approached Taihu Lake, it was discovered by the local water police. Finding the ship suspicious, they were about to go forward for inspection when the bandits noticed them. They dared to open fire and resist arrest. The water police also opened fire in response. However, as a result, the bandits managed to escape because their ship was light and they were skilled at sailing, and darkness fell soon after.</p>
<p>Interception in Shanghai: In this engagement, the water police did not suffer any losses. However, one bandit was killed and another seriously wounded by the gunfire. At that time, the remaining bandits suddenly had a strange idea and placed the dead bandit on top of the hostage Yao Qibao to intimidate him. Yao was terrified and did not dare to look. The next day, the bandits threw the dead bandit's body into the lake and sailed straight to Shanghai. They arrived at the Sun Temple in Zhabei. On the 5th, they planned to sail directly to the South City and moor secretly. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 AM on that morning, when the ship reached the Pu Mian area of Maojia Lane in the South City, the Municipal Public Security Bureau water patrol officers Meng Yunchen and Wang Yunshan, and patrolmen Hao Jiabang and Zhang Tingxian, passed by on patrol. Noticing that the ship looked suspicious, they intercepted the bandit ship and boarded it for inspection.</p>
<p>One Bandit Wounded: The officers initially found nothing. Later, they discovered a person in the cabin, groaning under the quilt. Upon seeing someone opening the hatch, he showed a look of panic, and his clothes were stained with blood. The officers became more suspicious and inspected him carefully. They saw that the person had gunshot wounds to his abdomen and waist, and they found a handgun and a hundred bullets near him. At this point, the officers immediately detained all seven people on board and took them to the team for interrogation. Chief Xu personally interrogated them. Yao Qibao then confessed the whole story. The wounded man confessed that his name was Duan Dekui, 30 years old, from Haizhou, and briefly described the circumstances of resisting arrest and being wounded. However, due to his serious injuries, his confession was unclear. One bandit confessed that his name was Pan Guoliang, 31 years old, from Qingjiang, and he was in charge of watching the hostage. Another bandit, Cao Jinbiao, was 35 years old, from Tongshan. Two other men, Dong San, 57 years old, from Yancheng, and Yang Kunshan, 45 years old, from Yancheng, were boatmen. They also claimed that there was still one bandit on the run, and that all the firearms had been taken by this bandit in advance. After questioning, Chief Xu determined that the case involved kidnapping for ransom and resisting arrest with gunfire, and immediately prepared a document to refer it to the judicial department for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Departure of Chinese Muslims for Mecca</h3>
<p>Chinese Muslims departing for Mecca to pay homage to the Kaaba are scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on the 10th of this month. Regarding travel arrangements, Mr. Jin Ziyun, a member of the Muslim community, has entrusted the China Travel Service to handle all preparations. All land and sea routes have been meticulously planned. Muslims from various regions are also arriving in Shanghai one after another. As the departure date approaches, further details will be reported as follows:</p>
<p>The Reason for Paying Homage: The birthplace of Islam is in Mecca, a place in the Arabian peninsula. There is a public hall called the Kaaba, also known as the Heavenly Palace. According to religious texts, the Arabian peninsula is located at the center of the Earth, and the holy city of Mecca is at the center of the Arabian peninsula. Religious doctrine dictates that the major ritual of paying homage should be performed once a year. Muslims who have the means must personally visit and pay homage once in their lifetime. Muslims do not believe in Buddha, so there are no statues in mosques. This year's ceremony of paying homage to the Arabian peninsula is scheduled to take place in February. A total of forty-nine Muslims from our country will be participating, and their names have already been published in this newspaper in the past.</p>
<p>Muslims Have Arrived: The Muslims traveling to Arabia to pay homage to the Kaaba are doing so out of personal volition. Therefore, many have come to Shanghai from Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and other places. Recently, they have arrived in Shanghai by land and mostly reside in the Xicheng Mosque. Special accommodations have been prepared inside the mosque, and Mr. Jin Ziyun is in charge of all hospitality. It is reported that there is still a group of Muslims from the Xikang area who are unable to travel south due to the obstruction of war.</p>
<p>Ma Fuxiang's Banquet: After the Muslims arrived in Shanghai, Ma Fuxiang, the former Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, specially hosted a banquet at the Xicheng Mosque to welcome the entire group of Muslims to Shanghai and provide refreshments after their journey. The host and guests enjoyed themselves very much during the banquet. The issue of Muslims' diet was given great importance. This time, they will take a ship to Singapore, and the ship's food arrangements have been discussed with the shipping company. The food will be prepared and managed by the Muslims themselves, with separate treatment from ordinary passengers. The Blue Funnel Line has agreed to instruct the ship to prepare raw materials for halal food for Muslims to use on board.</p>
<p>Scheduled Trip to Jeddah: There are no direct commercial ships from Shanghai to Mecca. The China Travel Service has negotiated with the Blue Funnel Line to have all Muslims take the Agamemnon to Singapore on the 10th of this month. Then, in Singapore, they will transfer to the company's Anchises to Jeddah at the Red Sea port. Afterwards they will transfer to a train to Mecca. Initially, it was proposed to have the Blue Funnel Line open a direct ship once, but negotiations failed. This time, each Muslim's round-trip ticket from Shanghai to Arabia costs about nine thousand taels, and other expenses are not included.</p>
<h3>Express Mail to the Three Eastern Provinces Still Available</h3>
<p>Other Items Temporarily Suspended: Shanghai Post Office News: All postal items to various places in the Three Eastern Provinces, except for express mail, will continue to be accepted as usual. All other items will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Bomb Explosion at Song Ziwen's Former Residence</h3>
<p>Doorman Zhou A'da Loses Two Fingers</p>
<p>Investigating the Source, Possibly Left Behind by Guards: According to the Huadong News Agency, National Government Committee member Song Ziwen's residence was originally at No. 83 Bixun Road. Two weeks ago, Mr. Song moved to No. 9 Qiqi Road for some reason. Unexpectedly, at noon on January 2nd of this year, a bomb was suddenly discovered in the flower garden outside the vacant house on Bixun Road, injuring Zhou Deben's son, A'da, the doorman hired by Mr. Song. He was severely injured. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Incident: According to the investigation, after Mr. Song moved, two doormen were still left to guard the vacant house at No. 83 Bixun Road in shifts. That day at noon, Zhou Deben's son, A'da, went to deliver lunch. While Deben was eating, A'da went to play in the garden. He noticed an iron can in the garden, and out of childish curiosity, he picked it up to examine it, causing it to explode. At the time, Deben and another doorman had not finished their meal. They heard a sound and thought it was a car cylinder exploding, so they ignored it. Not long after, they heard a cry for help from the garden and saw A'da covered in blood, rolling out from inside. They realized what had happened and went to help. A'da had suffered severe injuries, with the most serious wounds to his head and hands, a bloody mess that was a horrific sight. They immediately took the injured child by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road. They also reported to Song Ziwen. After hearing the report, Song Ziwen immediately led his guards to investigate everything and took responsibility for medical expenses. If he unfortunately died, he would also bear the full cost of funeral expenses. He then returned to the residence and reported to the French Concession police. The police immediately sent a large number of detectives to investigate and took the bomb shell back for analysis.</p>
<p>Source of the Bomb: According to the police, Mr. Song's residence is far from the road. When Mr. Song lived here, security was tight. Not only were idlers not allowed inside, but it was also impossible to throw objects in. The location where the bomb was found was in the back garden. The surrounding area is surrounded by short walls, and outsiders cannot reach it, nor can they throw bombs. According to reason and logic, if bandits intended to assassinate Mr. Song, their actions would never be so foolish. Therefore, after investigation, the source of the bomb may have been owned by Mr. Song's guards. It was accidentally left behind when he moved, causing this disaster.</p>
<p>The Injured Child's Condition: Zhou A'da was severely injured, but fortunately he was still mentally alert. His pulse and temperature were still good when he was admitted to the hospital. However, his condition was quite dangerous on the fourth day, but it gradually stabilized and his life should not be in danger. However, his left eye has already been blinded due to excessive injury. One of his hands has had a thumb blown off, and the other has had a pinky blown off. Even if he recovers in the future, he will inevitably become disabled.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Shots Missed, the Last Bullet Proved Fatal</h3>
<p>At 1:30 AM on the 1st of this month, French Concession police officer No. 33 Ju Yu (transliteration) and Chinese police officer No. 34 Qu Fusheng, armed, were on patrol. They were traveling west on Elgin Road and turned south onto Vermont Road. They saw two Chinese men walking north side by side. Their suspicious appearance raised suspicion. The Chinese and Western police officers ordered them to stop for inspection. Unexpectedly, upon hearing the order, one man turned and ran south, while the other ran north. The latter also pulled out a pistol and fired backwards to resist arrest. While running, he fired six shots along the way. The Chinese and Western police officers judged them to be bandits and pursued them, firing back. The Chinese police officer fired six shots, and the Western police officer fired eleven shots, all missing. The Western police officer saw the bandit turn into Xiao Rongchang and fired another shot, which hit the bandit in the back, exiting from the left chest below the nipple. He fell to the ground injured. A six-inch pistol with three bullets inside was found next to him. The police immediately hired a car to take him to the police station. Because he could not speak, it was impossible to question his name. He died soon after. His body was carried to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy room. On the morning of the same day, the Second Special Court was notified, and Inspector Lou Guangguang and a forensic doctor arrived to determine that the deceased died of injuries sustained from resisting arrest by firing a gun and being shot back. The corpse was ordered to be collected by Tongren Fuyuan Hall. Later, the police sent detectives to determine that the deceased was Hua Jinlin from Pudong, 29 years old, a boatman by profession. He lived in Qinci Yangdian and wandered around spending money, drifting into the bandit class. Later, the corpse's mother and wife requested the court to claim the corpse for burial.</p>
<h3>Brother-in-law Bears a Grudge, Murders His Wife's Younger Brother</h3>
<p>The Ten-Year-Old Escapes Death</p>
<p>Instantly Awakened by the Cold River</p>
<p>Xue Liangchen, a doctor from Yangzhou, lives at No. 4 1/2 Robert Road, Shanghai West. He has three daughters and two sons. His eldest daughter married Wang Guangqing's son Wang Deliang, also from their hometown. They have been married for several years. On the evening of January 3rd of this year, around 7:00 PM, Liangchen's youngest son, Xue Liuzhen, who was only ten years old, disappeared while playing at the door. Liangchen was so anxious that he reported it to the Gordon Road Police Station. On the morning of the 4th, a policeman from the 6th District Public Security Bureau accompanied Xue Liuzhen to Liangchen's home. After Liangchen questioned his son, he said that while playing at the door last night, his brother-in-law, Wang Deliang, took him to the entrance of the Zhongshan Hotel on Tianjin Road. Wang's accomplice, Hu, went inside and called out Chen A'si. They took a tram to Jing'an Temple and then hired a rickshaw to the railway station at Fanhuangdu. They crossed the railway and reached the riverbank near Zhongshan Road in Zhabei. Wang Deliang punched me three times, and Hu and Chen choked my throat, making it impossible to breathe. I instantly lost consciousness and was about to die. They thought I was dead, so they pushed me into the river to try to destroy the evidence. They left, but after falling into the river, the water helped me to wake up immediately. I shouted for help, and the police arrived, rescued me, and took me to the bureau. They sent a policeman to bring me back. After learning about the whole situation, Liangchen immediately reported to the police station. The police chief ordered detectives Liu Chunshu and Kai Naidai to take Xue Liuzhen to room 53 of the Zhongshan Hotel on Tianjin Road on the morning of the 4th to arrest Wang Deliang and Chen A'si. Hu had already fled. They were taken to the police station for detention. On the morning of the 5th, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Judge Wu Tingqi presided over the case. The police station lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the above situation, saying that they were prosecuting according to Article 275, Section 1 of the Criminal Law for abduction and Article 284, Section 2 for attempted murder. Detective Liu Chunshu testified about the arrest, and Xue Liangchen claimed that after Liuzhen disappeared, I searched everywhere without a trace until the police escorted him back. I learned that he had been abducted and murdered by my son-in-law, Wang Deliang. But I have no feud with Wang, nor any monetary disputes. I don't know why he did this. Xue Liuzhen also testified to everything and showed the injuries, with the fingerprints on his throat and wrists clearly visible. Judge Wu ordered the bailiff to accompany Xue Liuzhen to the forensic doctor for examination. Wang Deliang confessed that when I opened the Xiexing Leather Goods Store on Jessfield Road, my father-in-law, Xue Liangchen, often came to borrow money. Later, because business declined, my father, Wang Guangqing, asked my father-in-law for a loan, but he refused. So I asked him to join a monthly meeting of five yuan, but he was rejected again. I harbored resentment and, in extreme anger, planned to kill my brother-in-law. On the 2nd, Hu opened room 53 of the Zhongshan Hotel, and on the 3rd, he tricked Xue Liuzhen out and lured him to Zhongshan Road in Zhabei. Chen pushed him into the river. Chen A'si also pleaded guilty. Finally, the court appointed lawyer Zhao Zuwei to defend the defendant. Judge Wu announced the conclusion of the case debate and scheduled the verdict for next Tuesday. The two defendants were returned to custody.</p>

The apprentice's older brother, Afu (19 years old), who was sitting next to him, told his younger brother not to strike it, but Ashun did not listen. After a while, the hammer core felt hot and with a sudden sound, the hammer exploded. The partners sitting nearby were all stunned. Neighbors suspected that it was a bomb explosion and came out to look. Ashun's chest had been blown open with a hole, and his skull was also open. He ran to the gate and fell to the ground bleeding non-stop. Afu and a partner named Li Licheng (29 years old, from Haimen) were also injured, but Li's injuries were lighter.

<p>Dalai Wheel Damages One: At 7:30 am on the 5th, the Xinei small wheel towed four cargo ships from the Suzhou River inland, two in a row, two rows back and forth, intending to tow them to the China Coal Yard in Pudong. When it arrived outside the Hankou Road Customs Wharf, a Dalai Company large tugboat came from the south and crashed into one of the cargo ships in the back row, damaging the left side. Afterwards, the ship owner, Zhang Chaorong, requested the water patrol police to order the Dalai Company to compensate for the loss.</p>
<p>Garbage Boat Overturned by Waves: The owner of the garbage boat San, every day supervises the old boat partners to load garbage at the Xinkaihe Wharf in the French Concession. After loading at the location at 7:00 pm on the 2nd, intending to discard it at Nanhhuangpu, a small wheel passed by Zhoujia Ferry, and suddenly the raging waves rolled the garbage boat and the four boat partners were rescued by rowing boats.</p>
<p>Zhonghe Wheel Collides with Guangda: The Zhonghe wheel of He Feng Shipping Company opened into the Huangpu River yesterday at about 9:00 am. At about 10:00 am, the ship arrived in front of Gaochang Temple and planned to stop and anchor. As usual, the ship had to turn around. At that time, the tide was very fierce. The Zhonghe wheel was impacted by the rapid tide during the turning process, lost control of its driving ability, and the wheel body was violently hit by the tide and collided with the Guangda wheel parked on the river surface there. There was no time to avoid it, and a collision occurred. In the crisis, the Guangda wheel was impacted by the waves, and the ship body crossed to the Zhonghe side, and the stern of the Zhonghe wheel was also impacted by the tide, causing the two ships to collide with each other. The stern of the Guangda wheel was damaged in the collision. The ladders of the Zhonghe wheel were also damaged. After the accident, the two sides reported the incident to their respective bureaus. The China Merchants Bureau sent personnel to Guangda to inspect the damage, and the Hefeng Company sent a small steamer to Gaochang Temple to drag the stranded Zhonghe wheel, so that it could be towed out of the shoal at high tide. After the China Merchants Bureau sent personnel to Guangda to inspect the damage caused by the collision, the bureau estimated the damage caused by the collision and sent a letter to the Hefeng Wheel Company yesterday to negotiate and demand compensation for the loss.</p>

<h3>Reason for Shigemitsu's Return to His Country</h3>
<p>To Confer with Foreign Minister Arita on Negotiation Issues</p>
<p>Departure Date from Shanghai Not Yet Decided</p>
<p>Japanese Minister to China, Shigemitsu Aoi, is reportedly being summoned back to Japan by the Japanese government to personally confer with the newly appointed Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro on the direction of negotiations with China. Arita is currently returning to Japan via Siberia. It is expected that Shigemitsu will depart from Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru around the 9th. According to personnel at the Japanese legation, Minister Shigemitsu has recently recovered from illness, and the date of his return has not yet been fully decided. Rumors of immediate negotiations on the Manchuria issue have become rampant. The Japanese Consul in Beijing, Kamimura, came to Shanghai a few days ago to discuss the date when Minister Shigemitsu would meet with Foreign Minister Chen Youren in Beijing, and has recently returned to Beijing. Shigemitsu may make a trip to Beijing before returning to his country, but it is not greatly related to the negotiation issues. After Shigemitsu returns to his country and consults with Arita on negotiation principles, he will then return to Beijing. At that point, the Sino-Japanese negotiations will actively proceed.</p>
<h3>Meleo's Honor</h3>
<p>The British Emperor Bestows a Knighthood</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Friends Offer Congratulations</p>
<p>Customs Commissioner Meleo received an imperial decree from the British Emperor on New Year's Day, bestowing upon him a knighthood (Knight of the British Empire). Many Chinese and foreign friends of Meleo went to offer their congratulations. It is noted that Mr. Meleo is Irish and a nephew of the former Inspector General of Customs, Robert Hart. He arrived in China in December 1891 and entered the customs service. He first served as an assistant at the Yantai Customs, then was transferred to the Yingkou Customs, and later to the Beijing Inspectorate General of Customs. He was appointed as Deputy Customs Commissioner in 1899. Subsequently, he successively served as Customs Commissioner in Yichang, Fuzhou, Guangdong Customs, Jiangmen, Tengyue, Tianjin, Hankou, and Shanghai Customs. In October of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], he was appointed Deputy Inspector General of Customs by the National Government. In January of the 18th year [1929], he was promoted to Inspector General of Customs. Since joining the customs service, Mr. Meleo has been loyal to China and respected Chinese sovereignty. Therefore, during his tenure as Customs Commissioner at various ports, he sought to benefit merchants and safeguard national sovereignty externally, while treating Chinese and foreign personnel equally without discrimination internally. Since becoming Inspector General of Customs, he has made every effort to elevate the status of Chinese officials in the customs service, ensuring equal treatment for Chinese and foreign personnel. Mr. Meleo is quite loyal and respectful to the National Government and has a profound relationship with the Kuomintang. When the National Revolutionary Army launched an uprising in Guangdong, Mr. Meleo was the Guangdong Customs Commissioner. He provided much assistance in the transportation of materials for the revolutionary army. When the revolutionary government was established in Guangdong, Mr. Meleo was the first to raise the KMT flag to show his support. Because of this, he was highly regarded by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and had a personal friendship with Hu Hanmin and others.</p>

<h3>Joint Declaration of District Party Headquarters and District Branches</h3>
<p>The joint declaration of the district party headquarters and district branches of Shanghai Special Municipality states: Since the fall of the Eastern Provinces, the entire nation has shared a common hatred. Those concerned about the times believe that only by uniting to resist Japan can we save the dying nation, and only by unifying internally can we strengthen our external forces. Therefore, internal unity must be the prerequisite, and there must be no further divisions. Externally, we must take resisting Japan as our goal, and there must be no wavering. Since the patriotic youth were exploited by a small number of reactionary elements to sabotage transportation and attack party headquarters, social unrest and legal discipline have been swept away. Speculators have taken the opportunity to rise, and ambitious individuals have cleverly seized and plundered. Some advocate reforms to occupy for themselves, while others pretend to be engaged in commercial transportation to take over for themselves. They claim democracy by gathering twenty or forty people and calling it a city-wide party member congress, and they claim centralization by abandoning the central system and arbitrarily making decisions. Some even list the names of a dozen people while claiming to represent two or three thousand, with those listed here also listed there. Veiled accusations and strange phenomena emerge, clearly seeking to pursue their own private agendas and personal gains. How can this be called resisting Japan? What is the point of foreign policy? Abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the trivial, acting contrary to morality and going against the tide, has reached this point. Opinions become more numerous with each discussion, and groups become more divided with each separation. In the long night, all is pitch black. Before resisting external aggression, they engage in internal strife, leading to the failure of the effort to save the party and the country and foreshadowing the demise of both. It is heartbreaking to speak of, and infuriating to think of. All levels of party headquarters in our city cannot bear to see our nation with its four thousand years of glorious culture be destroyed by the small island nation, nor can we bear to see our party with its more than forty years of revolutionary history be destroyed by a small number of degenerates. Therefore, we specially unite the entire city's party members and issue a common declaration to correct public opinion and curb chaos at its source. We hope the public will understand: (1) The organization of party headquarters should be decided uniformly by the central government. (2) Party affairs must be conducted in strict accordance with the principle of democratic centralism, respecting both the central organizational system and the will of the majority. Any violation of this organizational principle will be resolutely resisted and not accepted. (3) We welcome and urge the three central committee members, Wu, Chen, and Shao, to come to Shanghai to guide party affairs. (4) We reject all reforms and other similar organizations that destroy laws and regulations, create false pretenses, and pursue personal gains. (5) Representatives should be elected from each district to petition the Central First Plenary Session to punish all organizations and troublemakers. (6) Among the current executive and supervisory committee members, Yang Qingyuan, Hou Dachun, and Deng Tongwei have resigned from the central government on the one hand and are listed in the Reform Association on the other, clearly being two-faced and wavering, having no statement denying participation. They should be considered members of the Reform Association and their qualifications as city executive and supervisory committee members should be revoked. (7) All party members in the city should unite under the aforementioned unified principles and work hard to resist Japan and address foreign policy, avoiding all selfish and self-serving individual activities.</p>

<h3>British Standard Cars Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The American-owned China Motor Car Company on Jing'an Temple Road received a large batch of 1932-style artificially constructed British Standard cars yesterday, including three models of different sizes. The novelty of their style, the precision of their components, and the remarkable fuel efficiency are unparalleled. Yesterday afternoon, the company displayed them in its showroom. Mr. Zhou Mengxian, the Chinese General Manager of the company, invited consuls from various countries and Chinese and foreign celebrities in Shanghai to visit. All praised the exquisite workmanship and excellent machinery of the cars and immediately placed orders for more than twenty vehicles.</p>

The female worker Jiao Lianying, who was trampled by the crowd, died from severe injuries at the Haibin Hospital at 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Second Benefit-Workers Medical Clinic of the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry's Second Benefit-Workers Medical Clinic, formerly the Zhabei Silk Factory Benefit-Workers Hospital, was established specifically to treat diseases of workers in the industry. Since its establishment nine years ago, the number of silk factories in the Zhabei District has decreased last year, so the number of patients visiting the clinic has also decreased compared to previous years. In the second half of 1931, the number of patients who were diagnosed in TCM internal and surgical medicine totaled 635 with 533 medications given. The number of patients who were diagnosed in Western internal and surgical medicine totaled 1,808 with 61,808 doses of medication given. At a time when the silk industry is bloodless and bone-exposed, the medical clinic still provides regular diagnoses and treatment. Benefiting workers and benefiting society is not a small achievement.</p>
<h3>Huifeng Tire Store Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Huifeng Tire Store at the intersection of Edward Road and Mahe Road, exclusively manages American Fisk tires for both internal and external vehicles. They are known for their sturdiness, durability, safety, and comfort.

<p>Reader Correspondence</p>
<h3>Reward for Answers</h3>
<p>The year 1931 has passed. Since the establishment of this column, we have answered questions from readers every day, which has been quite interesting. In this time of national crisis, there are several major issues that I, Fei Zaitian, should seriously study in my professional capacity. This column has set aside a small reward to solicit answers from readers.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding political reform, it is undeniable that the political measures of the past few years have not satisfied the hopes of the general public. Although the public has opinions, they are unable to express them due to restrictions. Now, the First Plenary Session of the Kuomintang has passed a proposal to effectively protect the people's rights to assembly, association, speech, and publication. After this liberation of speech, what are the first few things that the government should do from the perspective of the public to recover the scattered hearts of the people, save the latent crises of the nation's future, and the current calamity?</p>
<p>(2) Regarding student work, young people are responsible for the future of society. How much should we cherish them? Recently, they have been running around to promote and petition on the issue of national crisis. Their patriotic enthusiasm, even at the cost of their lives, is commendable and touching. However, the results of their efforts have not been beneficial to the country, and their studies have been seriously neglected. Fathers and elder brothers have a responsibility to guide their children, and elders have a responsibility to guide their juniors. What path should young people choose to work effectively?</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the manufacture of domestic goods, this column previously asked about effective methods to boycott Japanese goods. Mr. Liu Xintao from Jingde reported in detail on the porcelain manufacturing situation in the town and proposed an improvement plan. Since it was published on December 11th, Mr. Wang Yongkang launched a porcelain company based on it. In just ten days, more than thirty people have agreed to support it, and a letter has been sent announcing the official launch. How gratifying! It is hoped that people in various industries will reveal the real situation of their industries in detail to provide a basis for planning improvements, but not to attack the authorities, which would adversely affect the industry.</p>
<p>For each of the above three questions, each answer should be limited to a maximum of 1,000 words. Do not make high-sounding statements or talk empty words. Whether reasoning or reporting, please be concise, accurate, and practical. Please include your name, gender, age, occupation, and mailing address, and affix communication stamps and return postage stamps so that those whose answers are not published can be notified. After the answers are received, this newspaper will select the best ones for publication each day according to the capacity of this column, and rewards will be given according to the following grades: Grade A, 4 yuan; Grade B, 3 yuan; Grade C, 2 yuan; Grade D, 1 yuan. No reward will be given for unpublished answers. The deadline is the end of February. The three questions regarding education, career, and marriage will still be handled according to the existing regulations. Respectfully,</p>

<h3>My View of New Year's Day</h3>
<p>— Zhang Linqiu</p>
<p>Since the transformation of the Republic, the diligent Mr. New Year's Day has already visited twenty-one times. But every year when he comes to our precious China, although it is not always a time of good weather, peace, and prosperity, it is still better than this year, with cries of grief heard everywhere and the sound of cannons from the approaching Japanese devils. It makes us frightened and unable to cry. Recently, a friend asked me about my thoughts on this year's New Year's Day. I said it's like China, which is like a little master who is suffering from an illness. Many doctors who can recite a few Tangtou songs [formulas] have not been able to cure him. Later, his fifth uncle came back from abroad and sent him to a newly opened hospital without a formal head. Mr. New Year's Day is a guest who is very concerned about asking about the patient's condition. Every time this guest comes to inquire, he is always surprised that besides a few nurses in the sickroom who don't care about the pain and laugh to themselves, there are only a few irresponsible doctors arguing about prescriptions, creating a smoky atmosphere. He has never seen any trace of family members. So, when they see Mr. New Year's Day, they stare at each other and have no answer about the condition. They just fool around and act busy when the guest comes. This year, the little master's illness is a matter of nine deaths and one life. The family members are gradually realizing this. When Mr. New Year's Day comes back to inquire, most of them are in the hospital sickroom doing the work of crying and wailing. The doctors still insist on their own opinions and only want to fight. But crying and fighting are not methods to drive away death. The most important thing is that I only hope that the family members will quickly urge the responsible doctors to think of a rescue plan, so that this promising young man will not lose his vitality and die.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Elder Statesman</h3>
<p>— Bi Cheng</p>
<p>Elder statesman, old senior. These are originally common nouns, used as honorifics for older generations. They are also sometimes used as specialized terms. In the former Qing Hanlin Academy, those who passed the imperial exams three times before were called "seniors," and those who passed five times or more before were called "old seniors." This was the Hanlin's way of showing respect to those who came before them, not daring to neglect them. Now, the "unofficial elder statesman" I'm talking about is none other than my teacher, Mr. Hu Shiyu of Kunshan. Since the outbreak of the national crisis, he has resisted enemy goods and advocated the use of domestic goods, paying particular attention to simple and unadorned clothing. Therefore, zealous people have collectively advocated for simple clothing, sought friends who advocate for simple clothing, and expounded on the theory of simple clothing. I have seen this repeatedly in newspapers. This is truly an urgent task to save the times, used to alert the generally fashionable men and women who wear fine clothes and foreign goods, hoping to arouse their patriotic hearts. I still remember when I was studying at Caoqiao Middle School—it has been twenty years now. My teacher, Mr. Shiyu, had already set an example for the students by wearing simple clothes. Mr. Shiyu served at Caoqiao Middle School for the longest period. Among the thousands of students, who did not admire Mr. Shiyu's simple and unadorned clothing, his perseverance, and his rigor? Now, among my thousands of classmates, is there no one willing to wear simple clothes for the sake of the national salvation movement? Should we not call Mr. Shiyu an "old senior"? The teacher is skilled in poetry, especially good at painting plum blossoms. The seals used on his paintings often have the words "simple clothing" engraved on them, such as "clothing of coarse cloth," "learning poetry in simple clothing," "Hu Shiyu's seal in simple clothing," "Hu Shiyu's poetry and painting in simple clothing," "old man in simple clothing," "villager in simple clothing," "clothing that can last a lifetime," and so on. There are many such phrases. There are also those found in his poems, such as "I still pray for a good harvest of wheat and rice in the spring, and grow cotton myself in simple clothing," "I have heard that a vegetarian diet is good for health, living frugally I am still ashamed of the ancient man in simple clothing," "Sighing at the scattering of friends since childhood, the man in simple clothing has long abandoned fame and glory," "Cutting off the dust-covered hair, I think of the black hat, cherishing the simple clothing when the autumn cotton rots away," "Following the teachings of frugality, I remember my white-haired parents, striving to be a man in simple clothing for a hundred years," "Plain clothing has been my lifelong wish, the lamplight in the empty window overwhelms me with emotions," "A guest in a worn-out cloth robe for a long time in Jiangguan, washing away the black dust at the end of the year." These were all sent to me by Mr. Huang Dangmeng in the form of wax-seal poems. I often read them, so I can remember them. Recently, patriotic and enlightened people have often worn simple clothes as a promotion to save the times. Who knew that twenty years ago, there was a teacher teaching in a secondary school who had already set an example for students by wearing simple clothes, vowing to never change for the rest of his life? Like Mr. Shiyu, even if I have never been his student, I know that many would be willing to call him an "unofficial elder statesman." The teacher deserves it without shame.</p>
<h3>Before Dawn</h3>
<p>— Yun Yi</p>
<p>The wheel of the era is turning. Everyone must acknowledge that the film industry cannot remain in a dreamlike state of seduction. Look, Clara Bow's hot performances have already disgusted American audiences. The red-haired girl can no longer wear the crown of her previous glory in the silver arena. Mae Murray, after "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse," refused to play any more promiscuous roles in films because of warnings, and almost lost her original power because of her supporting role in "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse." Look again at how tireless "The Patriot" is in China. Even now, one can still hear that simple and majestic boatman's song everywhere. The audience of the film "All Quiet on the Western Front" is larger than the readers of the original book. Its power is enough to make all countries in the world have a kind of vigilance and fear towards it... Thus, it can be seen that the change in the style of films is the most important change in this year's film annual.</p>
<p>But what about in our country? The era of ancient costumes has passed. The era of martial arts has passed. The era of gods and monsters has also passed. Although now there is a noisy trend of sound, the weakness of the central power of each film is undeniable. I ask you, can you find some revolutionary emotions in the background of a theater? I ask you, can you find some curses of the environment in the love words of a couple? That weakness makes people passive, and that frivolity makes people romantic. To put it mildly, watching past Chinese movies was at most like drinking a cup of sugary soup. But today, we hope to see a film like going to a bomb, making life greater and making meaning more profound.</p>
<p>The tyrannical sun has invaded, and it has been three months in an instant. However, the cinemas on the sea are still showing those soulless films that only offer enjoyment. I really don't understand. I think that at this time, at least our country's film companies should wake up together and advocate using "iron and blood" to save the country. In other words, it is to make the spirit of iron and blood the soul of the film.</p>
<p>For example, like the new film "Iron-Blooded Youth" by the Star Film Company, it tells a poignant story of revolution. We see it as seeing Ms. Hu Die and Mr. Zheng Xiaoqiu, the leading actors, dropping a bomb and blowing up a dark night.</p>
<p>Good. The dawn has come. I love my country. I love the film "Iron-Blooded Youth."</p>
<p>Statement: The draft of the second "answer" to the "New Year's Three Questions" on New Year's Day has been completed. A word "Shang" (上) was mistakenly placed under the title. This is hereby clarified.</p>
<h3>Current Affairs Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>Chinese Gandhi. Gandhi of India, as a revolutionary leader, lived a simple life of coarse clothing and meager food, content with simplicity. His greatness of character deservedly made him worshiped by the world. Recently, Mr. Zhu Qinglai, on the first day of the national calendar, spoke at the Central Society about the future of the Republic of China. The principles he cited were mostly in line with Gandhianism. Mr. Zhu, with his thin cheeks and bald hair, revealed his teeth while speaking, and his attitude was very similar to Gandhi. Therefore, I jokingly called him the Chinese Gandhi. The teacher laughed and said, "Yang Huo resembled Confucius. Gandhi is Confucius, and I am Yang Huo." The audience burst into laughter. The teacher also said that Confucius's teachings, although separated by thousands of years, coincided with Gandhi's claims in an invisible way. Unfortunately, the current state of Confucian studies has declined, and attention is lacking, leading to the shaking of the foundation of the country. Many scholars in the audience sighed upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Lawyer Fu Jiu. Grand lawyer Zhu Fu Jiu, since practicing law, his business has been booming, and his doorstep is like a market. He is busy from morning to night, and his mouth and pen never stop. One day, a client from Huzhou came to visit, claiming to want to see Lawyer Fu Jiu, but his voice was very harsh and unbearable. Lawyer Zhu was also unhappy and told him to please use his surname next time, not his given name. This gentleman suddenly realized that the Huzhou pronunciation was different from the Shanghai pronunciation, and hurriedly apologized. However, I think that "Yuan Xu Gong" (元緒公, another name of a turtle) is a sign of longevity. In the past, people like Lu Guimeng and Li Guinian, and in recent times, Yuan Hanyun, also used "Gui" (turtle) in their other names or pen names, and did not avoid it at all. If Lawyer Zhu does not desire longevity, then the accidental homophony is not a problem. There is no need to argue about this point.</p>

<h3>Record of Martyrs of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Wang Chang</p>
<p>In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, our army's generals were arrogant and the soldiers were lazy, and there was internal suspicion. More than 100,000 soldiers lacked discipline, and they faced the fierce and rampant enemy. As a result, the navy and army were defeated and could not recover. This is truly the greatest shame of our nation in the past hundred years. Today's accumulated humiliation all started from this. However, in the aftermath of the shattering of our country, there was still Nie Shicheng's victory at Lianshan Pass, Zhang Xiluan's victory at Changdian and Kuandian, and in the partition of Taiwan, there was Wu Pengnian and Xu Xiang's victory at the Dajia River, and Lin Yicheng's victory at the Guyukou in Jiayi. The generals and soldiers in various places often died together in a single ship or in the loss of a single pass, with hundreds or thousands dying together, dying without a home but without regret. There is still remaining fervor even today. The principle of loyalty and righteousness had not yet been completely extinguished in people's hearts, so it was still possible to maintain righteousness in one out of ten thousand cases. When I read the historical records of the past, especially those concerning the years 1894 and 1895, I cannot help but put down the book and sigh when I think about the past and the present. Alas! Therefore, I am collecting old books and records to compile a record of the martyrs of the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and 1895 to encourage those who come after and to inspire those who go to fight the enemy. It is titled "1894" rather than "1895" because the events of 1895 originated from 1894.</p>
<p>Shen Shouchang, Lieutenant Commander of the Jiyuan warship, a lieutenant colonel. When the incident in Korea arose, the Japanese barbarians paid homage to the Korean king and severed maritime communications. In June of that year, the Beiyang Minister Li Wenzhong ordered the Jiyuan, Weiyuan, and Guangyi warships to transport the army to Asan. The enemy scouts learned of this and ambushed the ships in Hainan, south of Fengdao. Fang Boqian, captain of the Jiyuan, saw the enemy approaching, panicked, and hid in the thick armored section. Shouchang, the helmsman, stood upright without moving. Later, the rudder was destroyed by the enemy's fire. Shouchang was seriously wounded.</p>
<p>Ke Jianzhang, Lieutenant of the Jiyuan warship. After Shen Shouchang died in battle, Jianzhang took over and also died in battle.</p>
<p>Yang Jianluo, Captain of the Guangyi warship, a lieutenant colonel. The warship was set on fire by the enemy's artillery. Jianluo and more than 700 officers and soldiers died together.</p>
<p>Zuo Baogui, Commanding General of Gaozhou, Guangdong. A recorded admiral from Feixian. At that time, he commanded six battalions of Feng Army stationed in Pingyang to guard the Xuanwumen Ridge. In August, when the enemy army approached, Commander Ye Zhichao fled at night. The enemy then combined forces to surround Baogui. Therefore, the Hui people followed their Hui customs, bathing beforehand, determined to die, dressed in full uniform, and commanded the city. He was hit by artillery and could still speak on the ground. He died only when he reached the bottom of the city. Several of his subordinates died. Nearly all of the thousands of soldiers under his command died with him.</p>
<p>Zhu Tieqiang, a subordinate general of Zuo Baogui. His name has been lost. He was nicknamed "Tieqiang" (Iron Spear) because of his skill with the iron spear. He died with Baogui in Pyongyang. See my biography of Zhu Tieqiang for details.</p>
<h3>The Tale of the Twin Towers in Troubled Times (2)</h3>
<p>— Master of the Seeking Happiness Studio</p>
<p>Chapter One: A Matchless Courtesan Lives Alone, Yearning for Her Beautiful Family; A Scholar from a Foreign Land Roams, Forging a Strange Romance</p>
<p>In every special era, there must be special backgrounds and environments, and there are always special people. They emerge in response to the needs of the era. Sometimes, the temporary prominence of these very few special people dazzles so many people that they cannot escape the influence and control of this background and environment, so that the world is in a rush, drifting with the tide, falling together into the pit of this era in complete darkness. However, natural law is clear about cause and effect. You reap what you sow. Deception cannot last forever, and a fair and obvious judgment must be expressed. When the day of final reckoning arrives, right and wrong will be revealed. This special era will have long become the past. All those special people who were once prominent will have disappeared, and the general masses who once lived in that murky water will have become victims of the era, never to recover. This novel, "The Tale of the Twin Towers in Troubled Times," tells the story of such a special era, with the romance of a normal couple as the warp and the various backgrounds, environments, and special people of that era as the weft. As the story comes to an end, this romance happens to end this era. From beginning to end, the final reckoning is clear, and all the causes and effects of this era are clearly identified, and the truth of this era is recognized. The general idea is stated. Let's see how this book reveals and unfolds, leaving the theoretical side and staging the story. Let's talk about the flower world of the North and South Qingyin small classes in the Eight Great Hutongs of Beijing. Two years before now, a famous courtesan of matchless beauty came from the south. Her name was Liang Xiaoyun. She was tall and graceful, and her figure was perfect. All the patrons who had seen her unanimously acknowledged from an aesthetic point of view that there were three of the most precious and rare characteristics in her charming and beautiful appearance. Her skin was like flawless jade. Her eyes were like fine diamonds. The small dimples on her lips, like cherry blossoms, were especially mysterious and unfathomable. No such precious thing could be found in the world to serve as a proper metaphor. Moreover, if these three treasures were evaluated separately, they would be good, of course, but they would not be considered extremely beautiful. Perhaps they would still be the same as those possessed by other beautiful men and women. Only when all these characteristics were combined in her body, matched so harmoniously, arranged so neatly, and observed separately or together, were they not too fat, not too thin, not too big, not too small, not too thick, not too thin, not too much, not too little. Like the first copy of the Yellow Court Scripture, just right. If it were off by a little, it would seem inappropriate. If it exceeded by a little more, it would seem excessive. Only then would a concrete beauty be completed. No one</p>
<p>was as fully equipped as she was.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Market Conditions Fluctuate, Ultimately Rising Four Taels. Yesterday (the 6th), the gold price continued to show an upward trend, with erratic conditions. The price rose and fell in the morning session, and remained stable in the afternoon session. There were a total of nine taels of retrospective transactions throughout the day, with a total increase of about four taels. However, there were no large-volume transactions, and there were differences in opinion among counterparties, with stable opinions. Initially, it was rumored that although the high volume of gold bars rose repeatedly, the underlying reason was that the United States intended to reduce prices, leading to sales. Subsequently, however, it broke through the 700-tael mark. Later, it was rumored that the US silver conference had the ability to increase the demand for silver coins. When the news came, the atmosphere suddenly softened, and the sellers were overwhelming, resulting in a sharp drop of nine taels. It was presumed that the exchange rate had shifted from strong to loose. In the afternoon session, due to Wednesday's market holiday, the gold market was also stable, and demand from various firms was particularly scarce.</p>
<p>Early Opening Up Three Taels and Three Mace. From the early opening, it increased by three taels and three mace, to 693.5 taels. Large silver bars also rose by 1/16. Public and private telegrams on silver prices showed no prosperity or decline. It then retreated to 92.3 taels, immediately rising by more than 7 taels because Yuan Maoyong, Tian Fengyong, and others all entered the market, mutually doing business with American banks at 32.875 yuan for March, and 75 for this month, so at 9:20, it was 99.5 taels. Before long, Heng Changyong, Qian Changxiang, and others sold, dropping to 97 taels. The published price of British gold did not change, but American gold was reduced by .125, from 96.7 to 7.7 taels when settling small exchanges. Inside, American gold was traded at .8125, then dropped to 96 taels. Suddenly, Dadecheng, Yuan Heng, Heng Changyong, Fu Yu, Zhishengyong, and others came in and insisted on American gold being strong, the price was only calculated at 32.6875 yuan. The market situation was quite active, and in a rush, at 9:45, it became 700.05 taels. After entering, banks mutually traded current American gold at .8125, and the March and April sessions seemed to show loosening momentum. With those settling transactions stopping, they again sold, so the price rose to 33 yuan. The true reason was the rumored use of silver bars could be increased, and all war debts could be repaid with silver instead of gold. As a result, people's hearts were panicked, and Yifengyong, Daxingyong, Yuan Mao, Dadecheng, Yifeng, except for Da Hong Kangyong, Yuantai, and others, dumped their holdings, causing the market price to collapse, falling 8 or 9 taels. From 10 to 11 o'clock, it was only a little over one tael. It then became 91.2 taels. After entering, Wanxing, Yifengyong, Shunli, and others bought in, so the price was pulled up by over 3 taels. However, there was a fluctuation of one tael and several mace, until the noon closing at 94.6 taels. It then rose to 96 taels because Dadecheng, Fuyu, and others came in, changing the published price to 736 taels, with an estimated pressing of about 40 taels.</p>
<p>Afternoon Mediocre. The afternoon session opened at 97 taels, then 7.5 taels. This was the aftermath of the noon closing. Transactions within the market were unpleasant. Subsequently, it dropped to 95.2 taels. The Dalian gang and Hong Kangyong slightly entered, so an increase of around two taels, near 3 o'clock, became 96.3 taels. After entering, there was a slight rotation of a few mace to one tael, until after 4 o'clock, the Dalian gang sold over 200 bars, so it decreased by around 3 taels, becoming 93.4 taels. In an instant, scattered individual investors chased in, returning by seven or eight mace, becoming 94.2 taels. At 4:30, the closing price was 94.1 taels, an increase of 3.9 taels compared to the day before (already rising for three consecutive days, with a total of 14 taels). According to the full-day maximum price of 700.05 taels and the minimum price of 691.2 taels, there was a fluctuation of 9.3 taels. The early market for goods was 92 taels, the noon closing was 4.5, the afternoon was 6 taels, and the closing market was 5 taels. The published price was estimated to be pressed 40 to 42 taels, registered 703 taels, to 695 taels, with 703 taels of replenishing water, and 02 taels in the afternoon. Naked bars were estimated to have increased by 10.25 taels. Yufengyong still had buying.</p>
<p>Thin Volume of Inbound and Outbound Bars. According to surface trading statistics, Yuan Maoyong, Fuyu, Futaiheng, Hong Kangyong, Wanxing, Shunli, Qian Changxiang, Yuan Dayong, and Tian Fengyong all entered the market. Zhishengyong, Yuan Heng, Dakang, Tongfu, Hengyu, etc. had uneven inflows and outflows. Dadecheng had over 2,000 outbound bars, and over 1,600 inbound bars. Heng Changyong, Yifeng, Yuantai, Bingxing, Tong Taichang, and Yifengyong all had more outbound than inbound bars. Daxingyong, Yuanmao, and Yu Da had a total of over 2,000 outbound bars. In the afternoon, various firms felt especially scarce. Wanxing, Yuan Maoyong, and Hong Kangyong initially entered and then exited. Dadecheng, Zhishengyong, etc. all had scattered numbers. The Dalian gang had 300 to 400 outbound bars, and 600 to 700 inbound bars. The Guangdong gang slightly exited around 200 bars.</p>
<p>Retrospective of Last Year. Tracing back from the end of 1920 to the end of 1921, the changes were exceptionally shocking. It is estimated that large silver bars rose from 14.5 pence to 20 pence, and the forward price rose from 14.4375 pence to 20.125 pence, with a total increase of 5.5 pence to 5.6875 pence. The price of American silver fell from .3075 to .30125, a drop of .0625. Also, the HSBC exchange rate was initially 1 shilling 4.75 pence to 11.125 pence, a total increase of 6.375 pence. American gold fell from 33.875 yuan to 32.625 yuan, also a drop of 1.25 yuan. The internal market of banks also showed loosening of British gold and tightening of American gold, presumably due to the small trend in British and American exchange rates, resulting in different trends. The gold price was estimated to have increased by only 7.8 taels, from 677.7 taels to 685.5 taels. However, a retrospective of the year shows that in late May, there was an unprecedented peak of 818 taels. Subsequently, due to the Japanese invasion and occupation of the Eastern Provinces, it suddenly dropped to 586.5 taels, a difference of over 230 taels.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Red Plate. The gold industry exchange started on the 5th with a red plate, and the gold price trend was soaring, already exceeding 690 taels, frequently climbing, with a total difference of over 17 taels. The cumulative increase compared to the end of last year was 4.7 mace. The buyers were agile, and the exchange rate was also firm, seemingly showing covert support. It was presumed that large bars had risen for three consecutive days, so the opening price of gold fell by 7 taels to 678.5 taels. Afterwards, it moved forward all the way, with an estimated increase to 96 taels, to half of the 90.05 taels, which was due to large households selling fiercely. The afternoon opening price was 90.08 taels, then retreated from 92.8 taels to 89 taels until the closing price of 90.02 taels, with a maximum price of 96 taels and a minimum price of 78.5 taels, a high-low difference of 17.5 taels. The published price was estimated to be around 40 taels.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Firm, then Faltered</h3>
<p>Transactions are not robust… The Gold Gang first dug, then plugged</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of British silver continued to rise, American silver remained the same, and the European market was firm and then softened, all due to considerable sales by the United States. The exchange rate was still trending small-scale. The British-to-American exchange rate was estimated at 3.365 yuan, the American-to-British exchange rate was the same, so the HSBC exchange rate in Shanghai did not change for British gold, but American gold contracted by .125 to 30.625 yuan, Hong Kong added .0625, estimated at 75.75 taels, French exchange was slightly less than one yuan, He Yang added .75, Po Yang was slightly less than five mace, Indian and German exchange rates did not change, and the results of the internal bank were firm and then weakened compared to the day before, with British gold increasing by .0625 and American gold shrinking by .0625, which was a small exchange rate. The gold market turned strong to flat, once breaking through the 700 tael mark, but because the United States had the issue of silver coins compensating for war debts, which could be resolved, the Shanghai market turned loose. Transactions among Chinese merchants were not robust, with an estimated transaction volume of only tens of thousands of pounds of British gold. Mumbai sent a telegram to purchase, and American gold totaled about 450,000 to 500,000 yuan. The Gold Gang first dug and then plugged. Banks such as HSBC made some deposits. In the afternoon, there was no market as usual due to Wednesday.</p>
<p>British Exchange. The internal market was only .0625 different in half a day. In the morning, the asking price was about 1 shilling 11.625 to .5625 pence, and the buying price was .6875 to .625 pence. Shanghai Sumitomo put out 11.5 pence for March (Mumbai entered). Mitsui entered at the same price. The noon closing asking price was still .625 to .5625 pence, and the buying price was increased by .0625.</p>
<p>American Exchange. The internal market fluctuated by .1875 from morning to noon. The asking price in the early market was about 31.875 yuan, and the buying price was 23 yuan. Zhejiang put out, HSBC entered at .875 for March, Pangen put out, Yun Tong entered at .75 for January, Mitsui and HSBC mutually traded at .812.5 for February, Pangen put out at .75 to .6875 for March, Bank of China and Mai Hang, as well as China-Belgium and Xingye, did current term trades at .8125, HSBC entered at .9375 for April, Sumitomo entered at 33 yuan for April, Mitsui HSBC entered at 33 yuan for March, and Pangen entered at .9375 for May. The noon closing asking price was 32 yuan, .875 to .8125, and the buying price was increased by .125. The listed price of American gold was 3 taels 06.513 mace per yuan.</p>

<h3>Daily Interest Rates Consistently Decline</h3>
<p>From the 3rd to the 5th, in a Softening Market</p>
<p>General Market Conditions. This newspaper was closed for five days, and the bank was closed for four days, and business resumed as usual on the 5th. However, Qian Zhuang started business early on the 3rd. During these three days, transactions were indeed scarce, and various market prices also generally declined. As for the financial situation, it is currently an important key in the midst of contraction, and there is no possibility of business expansion. Yesterday's market conditions are as follows:</p>
<p>Daily Interest Rate Prices. The "foreign interest rate" early market interest rate was 7 qian 2 fen, and the noon market weakened to 7 qian 1 fen 9 li 8 hao 7 hu and a half, the same as the noon market the day before. The "silver interest rate" was 1 qian 5 fen in the early market and 1 qian in the noon market. Huatou Baihua had no added water, and the bank's listed price was 6 fen.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Currency Market Conditions. Jiangnan small foreign silver was 6 qian 5 fen 7 li in the early market, the same price in the noon market. There were 5,000 jiao of transactions in the early market and 3,000 jiao in the noon market.

There were 175,000 jiao of transactions in the early market and 25,000 jiao in the noon market. Steel yuan was reduced by 500 wen, to 371,500 wen. There were over 26,000 jiao of transactions.</p>
<p>Inbound and Outbound Silver. For "silver interest rates," the news of bank collections yesterday included Huashang collecting over 1.9 million in banknotes, foreign merchants collecting over 2.3 million in banknotes, and various goods, exchange rates, taxes, and miscellaneous fees collecting over 7.8 million. There were over 400,000 in pledge transactions, over 3 million in special collections, 1.2 million in outbound warehouse transactions, over 43 million in Qian Zhuang silver public receipts, over 3.8 million in Huatou transactions, over 500,000 in various exchange fees, and over 1 million in cash collections.

<h3>December Interest Rate Supplement</h3>
<p>The high cost of silver exchange in December of last year was detailed in this newspaper at the end of the year. Recently, the Money Dealers' Association decided that the base price for December interest rates would be 8 taels, 5 mace, 9 fen, and 5 li, which seems to be slightly less than the 2 taels of November. However, overdue interest will be added as usual. As such, the highest overdue interest will be between 14 and 15 taels, which is one of the highest interest rates in the past year (excluding November).</p>
<h3>The First Act of the Securities and Bond Market</h3>
<p>No market the day before yesterday, opened yesterday.</p>
<p>Prices fell sharply, market conditions were slack.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchants' Securities Exchange was originally scheduled to open on the 5th, but due to unforeseen circumstances, it did not open until yesterday. The current market is still lively, with many types of transactions. The February futures are still not open. Although the price fluctuations of January futures are quite large, the market outlook is sluggish due to the wait-and-see attitude of major players. As for the various bonds, the situation continues to lack vitality due to the political situation. Moreover, with the fall of Jinzhou and the entire Northeast handed over to others, the general public is increasingly pessimistic. In addition, the Lunar New Year is approaching and financial markets are particularly tight, making it difficult to be optimistic about the bond market environment. Buyers are very quiet, and although major sellers are still calm, sporadic sales are very active. As a result, the supply and demand are very disparate. Various bonds fell sharply at the beginning of the morning session, and continued to weaken step by step in the afternoon session, with the downward trend showing no sign of slowing down. The Unified Tax for January even stopped trading after falling to the limit price. Other bonds such as the 20 Customs Bonds and Salt Tax Bonds also almost stopped trading. Although the market was still sluggish in the afternoon, the trend had greatly eased. As a result, compared to the end of last year, except for the 96 Bonds which only fell by a small number of jiao, and the Customs Bonds which fell by 1.5 yuan, the other bonds fell by about 3 yuan each. The bond market seems to lack vitality, but the current prices are all very low, and there may not be any major changes in the short term. It is estimated that the total value of spot transactions for the day was 46,300 yuan, and the value of futures transactions was 3,640,000 yuan in the morning session and 1,750,000 yuan in the afternoon session, for a total of 5,390,000 yuan.</p>

<p>(Note) The price fluctuations of various bonds in the table above are calculated excluding the principal and interest of the previous period.</p>
<h3>After the Red Opening of Yarn and Cotton, Yarn and Cotton Only Tend Downstream</h3>
<p>Since the yarn market opened in red on the 4th, it has been trending downstream. The poor political situation and the blatant seizure of Jinzhou by the violent Japanese have led to financial emergencies and a lack of confidence. However, the actual demand from Sichuan and Guangdong is still good, but the selling prices are mediocre. In short, the deteriorating political situation has led to scattered retail sales. Some people are waiting and watching because the base is too small. As for the cotton market, it has also been trending down since the red opening. This is due to the stagnation of actual demand, the sluggishness of the overseas cotton market, the outbreak of political unrest in India, and the increasingly rampant Japanese aggression in the Northeast, which has weakened people's confidence. The Ningbo merchants are closing out long positions, but the Hubei merchants are still firm and refuse to show weakness.</p>
<p>People's Label - Scattered Retailers Sell Off: The market atmosphere was still flat at the opening of the morning session. The prices for various months rose slightly by 1, 3, and 5 qian. In the afternoon, due to the political situation, the situation became very weak and the prices for various months fell by 3, 4, and 6 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 6,650 bales. It was found that Feng sold 750 bales, Changfeng sold 750 bales, and Sichang sold 450 bales. Jifeng bought 300 bales, Zhenda bought 300 bales, Changyu bought 300 bales, and Yichang bought 900 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Sichuan and Guangdong Merchants Conduct More Transactions: Current yarn sales are still smooth. Yesterday, the various merchants bought a total of 1,800 bales.

On the 4th, the various merchants bought 2,125 bales, and on the 5th, they bought 1,650 bales. Most of the purchases were made by Sichuan and Guangdong merchants.</p>
<p>Hubei Label - Long Positions Exit: At the opening of the Hubei label market, the prices for various months rose by 5 fen to 1 qian due to the rise in American cotton and the strengthening of gold prices. In the afternoon, long positions were closed out and the prices for various months fell by 2 and 3 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 35,000 dan. It was found that Yuanda sold 1,300 dan, Hengyi sold 1,400 dan, Gongtai sold 1,300 dan, Tongyu sold 2,600 dan, Feng sold 1,400 dan, Yiyu sold 2,000 dan, and Deji sold 1,600 dan.

<h3>Grain - River Rice Market - Arrivals Scarce, Sales Flat</h3>
<p>Hu Nan: Seven or eight rice boats arrived yesterday. Transactions were normal among the merchants. The Su Xi white japonica rice was initially quite flat, but later it was heard that the northern market had turned firm. However, there were slight differences in the middle, top, and secondary grades. Chefang, Tongli, and white japonica rice each increased by 2 jiao. Although transactions were slow, there were concerns about further increases due to the shortage of inventory at the end of the year. Since the Winter Solstice Festival, buyers have been buying and selling as needed, with very little inventory. Ye, Qingpu, Fengjing, and Liantang, etc., all saw early and late rice rise by 1.5 jiao uniformly. The arrival of foreign Du and Jianpu Jiang goods was declining, and the overall market was also firm, perhaps by a jiao.</p>
<p>Xinzha: The source of goods for the various merchants is not strong, and the market is locked up. Top-quality japonica rice will reach 14 yuan, 7 or 8 jiao, and ordinary transactions are at 13 yuan, 2 or 3 jiao. The middle and secondary grades of japonica rice have risen by 1 jiao. At this time of scarcity and low inventory, although the replenishment of various stores is small, foreign Du and Jian are also gradually becoming scarce. In the past year, due to the import of foreign rice, the cost of Saigon small-grain rice has increased, and foreign firms have also set the market, making it impossible to recover. The thin rice market is also selling briskly, and the price is at a jiao, perhaps changing by a yuan. Although it is firm at the moment, it has an upward trend.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Sales Are Still Active</h3>
<p>The Tianjin merchants continue to handle customer yuan rice. Yesterday, the market for foreign customer indica rice still did not show much improvement. Even during the four or five days of the New Year, there were not many transactions. Only the Hubei merchants handled nearly a thousand bags of foreign rice. However, the Hubei merchants have already purchased 50,000 yuan worth of rice in Jiangxi, making the foreign customer indica rice in Shanghai not cost-effective. The Ningbo merchants have their own foreign rice arriving at the port and no longer buy it on the market. Tianjin only buys Jiangxi customer yuan rice and has been shipping out about 2,000 bags in recent days. The foreign rice continues to be ordered, but the market is not good, and the appetite of importers is also weak. Yesterday, only the Tianjin merchants handled more than 400 bags, priced at 13 yuan, 6 jiao to 7 jiao, 3 fen. In addition, 500 bags of Taizhou white rice newly arrived on this street, priced at 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 3 fen to 5 jiao. Also, 367 bags of Taizhou rice, priced at 9 yuan, 4 jiao. There were 500 bags of foreign rice, No. 1 West Rice, priced at 10 yuan, 0 jiao, 9 fen. Also, 1,500 bags of small-grain rice, priced at 9 yuan, 0 jiao to 7 jiao, 5 fen. There were no other transactions.</p>
<h3>Flour Falls 6-7 Fen in Three Days</h3>
<p>Since the flour market opened on the 4th, the market conditions for each month have seen a sharp decline. The sharp fall in the opening price on the 4th was due to the continued purchase of Australian wheat by manufacturers and dealers. The price fell from 3 taels, 7 qian, 2 fen, 3 li to 3 taels, 6 qian, 2 fen, a total of eight ships. It was also reported that a large batch of account wheat was being sold by the disaster relief agency for the purpose of distributing aid. Although the cost of additional water transport and unloading was very uneconomical, it was being offered to manufacturers in exchange for cash (the amount was said to be about 70,000 tons). As for foreign wheat, it also showed signs of softening during the suspension period. Due to these various reasons, confidence has been shaken. The extent of the near-term and long-term declines is not equal to the closing price of the 20th year, falling by 5 or 6 fen. On the 5th and 6th, due to the sharp decline on the 4th, confidence had just begun to calm down, with a fluctuation of about 1 or 2 fen. However, in terms of the overall trend, the near-term is under pressure from the Lunar New Year, and sales to customers are not easy to activate. In the long-term, foreign wheat is being ordered continuously, making it really difficult for the situation to turn around. Although the Southeast Asian merchants are still buying, it is feared that it will not help the situation. As a result, compared to the closing price of the 20th year, this month fell by 5 fen, 2 li, 5 hao, February fell by 6 fen, 7 li, 5 hao, March fell by 7 fen, April fell by 6 fen, 5 hao, May fell by 6 fen, and June opened at 2 qian, 9 fen, 1 fen, 7 li, also down by a small fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices Plunge by More Than 1 Qian</h3>
<p>The wheat market opened on the 5th, and because of the sharp fall in the flour market on the 4th, people were already panicked. By the 5th, the price of foreign wheat had fallen by another 3 or 4 jiao, so after the opening price, people were miserable. This month, the lowest price was actually 3 taels, 3 qian, 5 fen, which is 1 qian, 5 or 6 fen lower than before the New Year. The long-term price also fell by more than 1 qian. Yesterday, at the opening price, the near-term price was slightly better due to outside traders covering short positions. The long-term price also stabilized slightly due to outside traders buying in, and the momentum was naturally more stable due to the turn of the gold market. However, manufacturers continue to order foreign wheat, and the need for it is naturally reduced. Dealers are also continuing to compete for the top spot. In this environment, it is really difficult to be optimistic. As a result, this month fell by 1 qian, February fell by 1 qian, 4 fen, March fell by 1 qian, 5 fen, April fell by 1 qian, 4 fen, May fell by 1 qian, 3 fen, and there was little fluctuation in the June standard.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Especially Fine Teas - Active Sales to Europe</h3>
<p>The Shanghai foreign firms' tea market has shown signs of revival since the Lunar New Year. Baocheng Foreign Firm received a telegram from abroad for special fine teas from the source estates, and in the past two days, it has invited various tea shops to conduct negotiations. It is reported that an agreement has been reached for more than a hundred boxes, with prices all in the range of 150 to 160 taels. Within one or two days, the books will be opened. There are also sporadic transactions of secondary goods from local estates, such as needle eyebrow green tea.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Taikoo Sugar Goods are Scarce and Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Immediate Loading B Mark Opens at 5,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received a telegram from the producing area stating that the current price of Cuban sugar is still 1.15625. The price of New York futures sugar for March is 1.12, up 2 fen from the previous telegram. The price for May is 1.15, and the price for September is 1.26, each also up 1 fen. The price for December is 1.32, with no change. The current price of Java futures sugar remains unchanged. The Shanghai Association's trading was active, and the market atmosphere was charming. Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was priced at 9 taels, 7 qian, 5 fen. Slightly higher was 9 taels, 8 qian, and there was a shortage of household supplies. The trend was extremely charming. Mian Dutch white sugar was 11 taels, 5 qian, No. 20 medium sand white sugar was 9 taels, 6 qian, 5 fen, No. 18 was 9 taels, 6 qian, and No. 8 Dutch white sugar was 8 taels, 4 qian. The market conditions were firm. The inventory of Taikoo sugar was even thinner, and sales were smooth. The market suddenly rose sharply. B Mark was 12 taels, 1 qian, HX Mark was 11 taels, 7 qian to 7 qian, 5 fen, and HM Mark was 11 taels, 5 qian, 5 fen. There was still a shortage of household supplies, and the market atmosphere was extremely firm. The immediate loading of B Mark opened at 5,000 bags, with a price of 7 taels, 6 qian. The new regulations adding taxes were also quite popular. Hua Xinhao sold several hundred bags of spot Mian Dutch white sugar on the board, priced at 11 taels, 5 qian. 1,000 bags of coarse sand white sugar were priced at 9 taels, 7 qian, 5 fen. Importers were active, and the market shouted higher. New Qing sugar of domestic goods continued to be traded, priced at 8 taels, 2 qian, and high white sugar was 8 taels, 3 qian. The market was stable and not surprising.</p>
<h3>Metals - Pig Lead - Extreme Quietness Leads to Stirrings</h3>
<p>The trade in pig lead has been quiet for a long time because customer sales are slow and factory demand is sparse, leading to a sluggish trend. Moreover, the source of goods continues to arrive, and the inventory is abundant. The standard has a strong exterior but a weak interior. However, in recent days, the Yangtze River merchants have suddenly started purchasing, and the paint companies and yellow cinnabar factories on this street have also added a touch of color, giving the market a sense of extreme quietness leading to stirrings. It is found that the current market price is 14 taels, which is not a major improvement compared to before, but confidence has turned better. The market outlook is very promising for a gradual increase. It is heard that 600 to 700 bars were traded on the market yesterday. It is found that the opening price is mostly Huaxi lead, and there is also a small amount of Hunan local lead traded.</p>

<h3>Opening Remarks</h3>
<p>— Reading Snow</p>
<p>Needless to say, Shanghai is a glamorous world, a comprehensive den of devils, and a magnificent picture. Who can say, "I understand Shanghai"? At most, you only understand the side you can understand.</p>
<p>There is the joy of life and the cries of life here, like the human world and like hell. The golden river reflects the silent sky. Shanghai is an incomprehensible mystery.</p>
<p>We are willing to be a small butcher, to do a precise dissection of Shanghai. If we cannot, then even a naked exposure is not without meaning. Because only under thorough exposure can the true prototype of Shanghai be revealed, and only then can a "New Shanghai" paradise be built.</p>
<p>Shanghai is everyone's Shanghai, so of course everyone must work together to expose and build it. Today is an auspicious day, so let's consider it the beginning of everyone working together.</p>

<h3>Science and Syphilis</h3>
<p>— Autumn Chant</p>
<p>Shanghai is a large-scale manufacturer of syphilis. If you are a man and meet a beautiful woman at the entrance of a lane who wants to pull you to her house for fun, you must not fall for it. If you are a woman and meet a handsome young man on the street who is flirting with you, you must not be hooked by him. Because 99 percent of such men or women have syphilis for sale. What you get in her or his arms is not happiness but a lifelong incurable pain.</p>
<p>You go whoring or are prostituted, and after a few days, thinking you are not sick, you boldly go to sleep with your wife or husband. Good, after another month or so, your disease breaks out; after a few more days, your partner's disease also breaks out; after eight or nine months, a child with syphilis is born. Syphilis has since become your family heirloom.</p>
<p>You say you have 606, what are you afraid of! Good, to cure the root of the disease with more than a dozen injections will cost you a year's salary. You can only barely afford to give one or two injections, and sure enough, it seems like you are not sick. After five years, six years, ten years, twenty years, the disease recurs, your nose falls off, your eyes rot and go blind. The syphilis bacteria will enter and turn you into a skeleton. Salvarsan (i.e., 606) and Neosalvarsan (i.e., 914) invented by Paul Ehrlich cannot reach the brain, so they cannot be your reinforcements. If you want to escape death again, you must suffer a terrible bout of malaria, develop a very high fever, and burn the syphilis bacteria in your brain to death. However, you yourself will have a nine-out-of-ten chance of dying.</p>
<p>If you are greedy for cheap and encounter a quack doctor who treats your life as a joke, and make a mistake by injecting air into your blood vessels, you will immediately cry alas!</p>
<p>Shanghai men and women! After reading this article, think again. Hunting wild chickens and soliciting customers is not a trick you can do!</p>

<h3>On the Tram</h3>
<p>— Quiet</p>
<p>Returning home from the bowling alley, I jumped on the tram and gave a jiao to the ticket seller. But he did not give me a ticket, with a bitter smile on his face, he kept saying, "Thank you."</p>
<p>I felt that this guy was too outrageous; he had already earned an eight-board copper coin premium for a single jiao, and he still wanted to freeload. I couldn't bear it anymore, I forced him to give me a ticket, I said, "I cannot help anyone cheat."</p>
<p>He asked me, "Sir, are you a Christian?"</p>
<p>I said, "No, but I think your behavior is wrong! It is a bad habit, a bad education. Public cheating gives a bad impression to a generation of young apprentices and students. It is truly a deep sin!"</p>
<p>"However, what does it matter to you that I am freeloading from foreigners? Moreover, there are many people who are openly and secretly stealing! Which of the public officials is not a wealthy fat cat? Which one did not benefit from 'land speculation' and 'moneybag policies?' Sir, broaden your horizons. To eliminate the bad habit of 'freeloading,' please start with the bigger picture!"</p>
<p>I had no words to refute him. I thought, today I have received a rare lesson. This lesson really contains a lot of spicy flavor. I hope everyone chews it carefully.</p>
<p>Shanghai Stories (1)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Stories</h3>
<p>— Compiled and translated by Zhou Rong</p>
<p>Chapter 1: Shanghai Before the Opening of the Port - First Impressions</p>
<p>The first impression a traveler gets upon arriving in Shanghai now is as if they have walked into a major European city. Tall buildings, orderly roads, grand hotels and entertainment venues, beautiful parks and bridges, streams of cars and trams, rows of foreign shops, and the brilliant and dazzling electric lights at night—all this makes a European or American traveler feel as if they are in their hometown. The only differences are the densely packed Chinese people coming and going in the streets, the Indian policemen standing guard, the rickshaws and handcarts weaving through the crowds, and the Chinese shops with their ornate guilds and symbolic signboards.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the largest and most peculiar commercial port, where people of all countries and colors gather. People from all directions reside in this port, resembling a world metropolis. Shanghai is indeed one of the most noteworthy cities in the world.</p>
<p>If a foreigner were to hear that the French and British concessions in Shanghai were originally just a sandy beach with only sparse grass huts and shacks, and that it has now been transformed into a bustling world, that foreigner would be astonished, unable to imagine such rapid development in just over eighty years. Shanghai has only been open as a port since 1843 (the 23rd year of the Daoguang Emperor), which makes the current year, 1932, only eighty-eight years of history.</p>
<p>Absurd Legends</p>
<p>Speaking of the history of the Shanghai place name, it is also called Shenjiang and Xiepu, said to be named after Lord Chunshen and Huang Xie of the Warring States period. However, after studying the history of the changes in the terrain of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, these absurd legends are self-defeating. Studying the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, from Wuhu downstream, the inclination of the riverbed suddenly changes from one twenty-thousandth to one hundred-thousandth, meaning the riverbed lowers by half an inch per mile. As a result, silt gradually accumulates and thickens. However, between Nanjing and Zhenjiang, the mountain ranges on both banks directly border the river, preventing the silt from spreading to the banks and allowing it to be washed downstream. Downstream from Jiangyin, the terrain becomes lower, and there are no mountains on either side to restrain the flow, so sediment accumulates, developing into a flat mainland.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Ding Wenjiang's speculation, the coastline of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River can expand by one mile every sixty-nine years. According to Dr. Haiding Stange's calculation, it also expands by one mile every sixty-nine years, the two numbers being quite similar. Jiangyin is now eighty miles from the sea. According to the calculations of the two doctors, five thousand years ago, the coastline must have been at Jiangyin. In the era of Lord Chunshen and Huang Xie, Shanghai was still the ocean. It can be seen that the previous people's hearsay attachments to the names Shenjiang and Xiepu are all unfounded.</p>
<p>As for Shanghai being called Hu, it does have some origin. During the Yonghe period of the Jin Dynasty (around 350 AD), Yu Tan built the Hudulu Fortress to defend against sea bandits. The origin of the character Hu may come from the abbreviation of Hudulu Fortress. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Sketch of North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>— Qiuxin</p>
<p>The Japanese Marines, in groups of five, are scattered on the road, pacing back and forth, searching everywhere. Some are riding in cars, carrying live ammunition, flaunting their power and driving around. But the general young Chinese are still immersed in their dreams, unwilling to wake up, all day long laughing and chatting with their lovers in theaters and dance halls, seemingly unconcerned about the enemy trampling on their territory, as if it is not their responsibility.</p>
<p>The barbaric soldiers are still recklessly rampaging through our territory, destroying and provoking everywhere, while our compatriots are just watching them flaunt their power and leave.</p>
<p>The self-proclaimed patriotic youths are dancing in the dance halls, so happy that they forget to return, and some even sacrifice all their work to concentrate their efforts on the dancing girls, working harder than on any homework or national salvation movement. The entrance to the movie theater is packed with young people stretching out their hands to buy tickets, braver than going to the front lines.</p>
<p>Ah! Aren't they the youths who are constantly shouting about saving the country?</p>
<p>Ah! Compatriots, wake up quickly!</p>

<h3>New Trends in Divorce Procedures in Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Qin Lan</p>
<p>Today, if married men and women living in Spain want to terminate their marriage contract and permanently break away from the relationship, they no longer need serious reasons. According to the new Spanish constitution, as long as both men and women agree, the divorce is legal. Compared to the past, when divorce was not allowed under any circumstances, the termination of marriage is now much simpler. But it is still not as easy as in Russia and Mexico. Those countries are truly the easiest countries in the world to get a divorce. As for Paris, the wronged used to rely on the laws of this place to pursue divorce, but now foreigners are no longer allowed to enjoy this right. At least they must have lived in France for two to three years before they can cite her divorce regulations.</p>
<p>In order to cater to the needs of the masses who are determined to get divorced, the laws of various states in France are constantly being adapted. For example, the state of Rennes initially stipulated a six-month residency period before submitting a divorce request to facilitate divorcees. Later, Paris began to solicit divorce business, so Rennes shortened the residency period to three months. Afterwards, neighboring famous states came to compete for this "good business," and divorce procedures became simpler and simpler. Thus, Rennes further reduced the necessary residency period to six weeks. (To be continued)</p>
