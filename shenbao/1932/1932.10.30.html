<p>意相墨索里尼日昨在米蘭演説。謂十年内全歐將遍行法西斯主義。而以意國爲之中心。末謂世界恢復健康之道。不在屢開會議。意國所欲者。在乎會議少而决議多。提案少而建設多。</p>
<p>法西斯主義是否將於十年内爲全歐所採取。墨氏之言是否完全基于合理之論而不含有幾分誇大性。俱非吾人今日所欲論列。吾人祇覺對其「會議少而决議多提案少而建設多」之末二語。有不勝瞿目驚心者。在彼爲一種深致矜兀之表示。在我則成爲正中弊竇之抉發。汗顔讀此。感慨甚矣。　　環顧世界各邦。最失健康之國家。甯有逾於今日之我國乎。會議最多建設最少之政局。甯非我國特著之現象乎。地方行政。且勿之論。以言乎中央。則各部部務會議也。行政院會議也。立法院會議也。國府會議也。中央政治會議也。中央常務會議也疊牀架屋纍進不己。正式例會之不足。間之以茶話會臨時會。擴大之則有中執全會焉。有全代大會焉。外加穿插者。則有全國經濟會議。</p>
<p>全國内政會議。全國民食會議。以及其他各種會議臨時召集者。有國難會議也外。交特别委員會也滿目琳琅。豈勝枚舉會。議之多。猗歟盛哉。</p>
<p>以如此恒數之會議。多少宜有幾項决議可以慰下民喁喁望治之情者矣。以如此重疊之機關。多少總宜得審愼之道以拯吾人疾苦於萬一者矣。然而吾人所翹首跂足者。祇見院議例會。逐日排演。舍更動幾批政局人員外。絶少有裨益民生之决議、其略涉疑難之事件。則院府以交中政會。中政會以交中常會。中常會又不能决。則集各中委以交換蘄嚮焉。冠蓋紛馳以徵取意見焉。又不能决。則留待中執全會之處斷。或逕發交原機關重議焉。呈報上去。遞解回來。極紆迴曲折之結果。而問題癓結所在。猶未必全解。决議之難也如是。以言乎建設每當一種大會召開。閎俊畢集。議論則風發泉湧提案則車載斗量。郵電有疲于投遞之勢。報紙感不勝披載之苦。己而聞提案交整理矣。付審查矣。討論矣。擱置矣。修正通過矣。交政府執行矣。最後則大會閉幕矣。一到大會閉幕而吾人之希望亦告一段落。空山不見人。但聞人語響。回不啻爲吾國會議寫眞而作也。</p>
<p>抑吾人所尤引以爲怪詫者。列席各種會議之各委。大都爲有並注兼營之性質者。例如外委會之委員。固多即爲中政會之委員。而謂外委會所不能解决之事件。中政會即能解决。之在中政會中所不能貢獻之意見。一到外委會即能表出之。甯非事之滑稽可笑者乎。政府中人。平日對一切變故。無適當之準備。一到事機緊迫。衆口交謫。輒以宣傅政策爲遮矢之盾。今日甲午委發一談話。曰某案己得有解决之辦法。明日乙要人發一聲明。謂某事己擬定正確之方案。祇圖眼前清净。罔顧事實證明。要猶是狙公朝四暮三之故智。而會議之效。益見其僅矣。</p>
<p>要之。會議雖多而無决議。則不如勿議。提案雖多而無建設。則不如勿提。無會議無提案。吾人猶冀一日得藉會議以解决難题。遵提案以進行建設。若日日在會議之中。事事無進展可見。發言盈庭。竟無執咎之土。道謀築室。是用不潰于成。距恢復健康之道。不己遠乎。墨氏之言。固不難以他山之石爲攻錯之資者。暮鼓晨鐘。發人深省袞袞諸公。諦聽諦聽。</p>

<p>▲不幸以一比三慘敗</p>
<p>▲上半時劇戰無結果</p>
<p>東華與優游兩足球隊昨日冒雨作戰於中華棒球場、此係西聯足球甲組聯賽之一幕、優游明知不敵、乃以全副力量保守、前四十五分鐘、東華竟不得其門而入、枉費心血毫無建樹反而幾爲優游暗算、幸而周賢言拯救得法、得保江山、下半時中優游後衛主將朱璆受傷、陣容忽形散漫、致爲東華乘隙由屠開元馮運佑先後攻入兩球、後優游石金生亦還敬一只、東華李義臣亦中一球、結果東華乃以三比一勝、觀者寥寥、表演頗少精彩、</p>
<p>▲東華兩次攻門不中三時既届、裁判員何春輝下令交鋒、優游開球不能深入、遭東華之猛力壓迫、優游見勢不佳、前鋒均調回防守、不取攻勢、東華陳虞添陳洪光在優游門下、得球攻門、機會甚佳、可惜未中、</p>
<p>▲鐵門未破幸哉幸哉優游僅由左右兩翼及中鋒三人前攻、（兩内鋒均作防守工作）故殊少進攻機會、然曾有兩次險球、幾破東華鐵門、觀衆咋舌止、一次爲右翼朱生發之傅中、董小培頭頂、球向門角而去、周賢言快手救出又一次爲左翼孫惠培孤軍深入、破兩道防缐、至底缐處送東華門前、董小培衝上、周賢言接球跌地、幸即滾避得法、化危爲安、此兩球東華吃驚非小、上半時各無所獲、</p>
<p>▲主將受傷江山陷落東華志在必勝、下午時起想盡各種方法、以爲摧敵制勝之計、</p>
<p>、但前十五分鐘、依然無機可乘、後因優游守將朱璆大腿受創、不能控制敵人、致被東華屠開元在亂軍中攻入一球、紀事乃開、往後馮運佑亦中一球、優游江山不保矣、</p>
<p>▲石金生果然破鐵門優游兩球既失、明知守亦無效矣、乃興師進攻、右路前進、逼成角球、朱生發妙送、本甯遠成角球、朱再錫、正落門前、李甯頭頂解危、不料爲優游前衛石金生得、石處此機會極佳、對門偷射、球入門角、周賢</p>
<p>言仆地未及、鐵門竟破、但此球進後、不多時東華李義臣猛射一球、清晽美觀、造成三與一之結果、列陣如下、</p>

<p>本届長期交割狀况、遠不及往届之盛、放欵長期、更無論其淡旺、簡直視若無事、惟存息長期因各殷户頭襯、舍存銀錢兩業外、實無其他安藏之處、是以存欵長期之數額、依然不減曩昔、至於此項存欵息價、向來由錢業先輩互相討論、觀察市面、供求大勢、而定其存息（即内盤）之高下、本届因需要怠懈、本可减低、但爲防患於未然、並爲聯絡殷户感情起見、故仍决定爲五兩五錢、與上届（四月）之市價、無甚軒輊云、</p>

<p>自由談	二一枝譚新望氣學  瞻廬　　歷史上告訴我的望氣學，可以在氣象上面，望得出國家安危興亡，和個人的窮通禍福，這是何等的本領啊！到了現化不聞繼起；是不是望氣學業己失傅？或者本來没有這麽一回事，古人在歷史上吹牛？　　其實呢、現在有一種「人人皆知個盡曉」的新望氣學：這是很普徧的、只須揭開每日的報紙，便可作爲一種新望氣學的測騐器。　　望到歐美各國，便覺得充滿着一種不景氣：某國的驕矜之氣，影響軍縮實行：某國的憤懑之氣，醖釀復仇舉動：還有南美某某爾小國的一鼓作氣，至今不肯罷手；這都是不祥之氣的表現。便是，英美兩國，號稱富强：近來也帶些不景氣；但看，英國親王出游，受那失業貧民的奚落：美國大總統演説，飽聆反對。派的種種種侮辱：這些氣象是什麽？唉！不言可喻了！　　抱着侵略主義的島國，表面上氣吞全滿；但要「一口氣呵得牛頭熟、」只怕問題正多咧。他們自己人的説的；吞了滿洲，宛比吞了炸彈。將來爆裂起來，就此斷氣也未可知。　　回顧本國，覺得氣象益發不好了！所有勇氣壯氣，都流落到關外去了；只有涙竭聲嘶的救國軍和義勇軍在那裏支撑而呼號！講到關内呢，要人的闊氣，災民的怨氣，奸商的戾氣，早己閙的烏烟瘴氣；還加着魯難未己，川亂又起；對於外侮是非常客氣，對於自己人却又「憑陵殺氣、以相翦屠；」這又是戰地人民的晦氣了！唉！時事至此，眞令人氣破了胸脯。　　讀到文天祥的正氣歌，其中所述「氣壯山河」的人物很多：現在都到了那裏去呢？正氣的人物找不到，找得到的，只有蘇州人所説：歪嘴吹嗽叭，一團邪氣。新寒衣曲！  程魯丁　　—唱與諸位先生小姐聽—　　秋是静悄悄地去了，冬是静悄悄地來哩。　　紅葉，黃花，安排了秋之離筵，寒風，嚴霜，預備着冬的香車。　　金風拂面，玉露凝霜，這正是一個秋去冬來的時候了。自然，秋是撥揮了我一片撩人的愁，不錯，冬又增添了我一串傷心的涙！　　秋去冬來，在這過程中，確有無數的白髮與紅顔，一枝枝的心針串起涙珠，一縷縷的愁絲，織成寒衣，托着征鴻，害與親人去，然而，在破碎的山河中，却也有浴血長驅枕戈露宿的民族英雄，我哭，我悲，但是我眞不願再寫了，在那生與死之綫上又是一個如何的世界？　萬里絶塞，千數孤軍，烏盡草滅，雨泣風號，雪花與血花亂飛，鬼聲與哭聲齊邊，在這裏，没有氣暖風和的地方，並無皮裘棉衣的供給，只有熱血，只有冷涙，只有勇氣，只有雄心，來過這冰天雪地的苦戰生活。　　假使是有感情的話，誰也不會袖手旁觀，假使是有理智的話，誰也不會熟視無覩，如果不是一個神經變態的人，誰也决不能任他們這樣長處下去，或者，倒因此反而努力地援助着他們。　　經濟，糧食，固然是重要，同樣，他們現在所需要的寒衣，也是刻不容緩，反過來説，他們的需要，就是我們的需要，他們的痛苦，無異我們的痛苦！　　而且，一個國家的存亡，必有其所以存亡者，必有其可以存亡者，也就是視乎民衆的意志與行動而定。　　假使中國無他們啊！縱有他們，而無他們的意志，而無他們的行動，那末，中國亦己早亡了·至多，亦不過一個名存實亡的中國而己。　　中國現在之能由亡中求存者，只有他門，而且要有他們，才會不亡。　　這不是誇張，這不是過譽，而况鐵一般的事實，原也是不可掩的事實。　　先生們，小姐們，聽了我底寒衣曲，應該怎樣？　　不但怎樣啊！而且應該拿出辦法來。青天白日滿地紅  沈玉麟　　青年在求學時代，宜鍛鍊身體，專心攻讀，建固根基，造成將來的主人翁。離開學校生活，爲社會人羣服務，不應隨波逐流，當轉移社會惡劣的環境！　　天天母忘國耻，直等到恥雪的日子爲止，否則醉生夢死，國家前途，就不堪設想了！　　白白的得來，白白的捨去，這是耶穌基督的言行；世人果能看破一切，世界大同，立即可以實現！　　日本帝國主義者是中華人民的公敵，我們如無消滅它的能力，簡直就没有我們生活的日子！　　滿洲僞國！凡維護公理的國家决不承認，因爲它的組織陰險，背景惡劣！我們當急不容緩地站在一條戰缐上去討伐它！　　地土喪失是國家的奇恥大辱！積極收復失地，纔是中華民族唯一的生路！　　紅的血，血要熱，趁着熱血，去把敵人殲滅！（不受酬）現代寓言—呢帽和絲襪—  淺笑　　　　摩登少年睡熟的時候。衣架上的一頂呢帽，對着那雙絲襪笑道：「老兄眞低賤！只是裏住了脚，和皮鞋作伴：像我呢，高高在上，和梳得澬亮的頭髮厮磨着，多麽冩意啊！」絲襪聽他驕傲的話，無言可答。　　過了幾天，少年覺得頭上的呢帽，己經不時，便送它到皮鞋店裏，改做一副脚套。（穿西裝時罩在皮鞋上面的）同時，又把那雙絲襪，剪下那段襪統，做成一隻精緻的壓髮帽。（按，摩登少年常利用廢奮絲襪做靨髮帽的。）戴在頭上。　　那隻壓髮帽從頭上俯視下來，認得少年脚上的呢套，就是譏笑過它的呢帽，便報復它道：「呢帽兄，你怎麽也裏住了脚，和皮鞋作伴，過着低賤的生活了·」呢帽抬起頭來一看，記得那隻壓髮帽就是自己嘲笑過的絲襪，不覺羞慚得無地可容。藝術界消息  華全國道路建設恊會。此次假座新世界舉行十二週年紀念展覧游藝大會。自十月八日起。以一月爲限。此一月中每日除新世界雇用之十餘種游藝照例公演外。復在新華劇場排演各種特殊節目。今後半月。著名非職業游藝團體須參加者。尚大有人在。如電影明星張織雲·楊耐梅等。亦將表演新頴節目。又聞著名戲劇家唐槐秋·應雲衛·袁牧之·孟君謀·嚴箇凡等。糾集同志。排演名劇。己定月之二十九至三十一日三日爲分演期。劇目有四。（一）「蠢貨」俄國契柯夫作。（二）「酒後」丁西林作。（三）「買賣」歐陽予倩作。（四）父歸日本菊池寛作。參加表演者除上述五人外。尚有張惠靈·任光·沈潼·錢汝霖·饒建昌王遐文·王紹清·及李麗蓮·吴家堂·王瑩·唐湘清·閔翠英諸女士等。聞佈景道具。俱爲特製。以如是人才。演如是名劇。實屬難能可貴云。説部扶輪會入關郵侣（二六）  求幸福齋主　　這時，郵員們脱離了日本人的束縛，回復爲中華民國的自由人，并看見近些日子所闊别的國旗在山海關城頭飄揚了！一個個都喜極欲狂，不知道是笑的好？抑還是哭的好？魯伯勤堅握着佟一貞的手大聲慶賀：　　「我俩是平安入關了！此後只有永永相愛，再没有什麽阻礙我困難發現在我俩的愛的坦途中了！」　　但佟一貞此時怱眷懷故土，在魯伯勤懷中竟嬌啼宛轉的説道：「我得着了愛人，雖并不一定想家鄉，然而東北究是中華民國的國土，東北人也究是中華民國的人民啊！想起那地方現被暴日强占了去，人民又一齊當了俘虜，不知何日才得收復？何日才得自由？若長此没有收復的可能，我也永無還鄉的希望，我又那能不能痛哭流涕啊」</p>
<p>魯伯勤一聽，立刻又默然了！怔怔許久，也想不出該説些什麽詞令來尉籍一貞？就是這樣彼此抑鬱無歡的又到達了北平。　　　在北平下車後，逕帶了一貞到堂兄魯大年家裏，叙明了一切，魯大年倒滿口説好好，留他俩在家中住下，并答應擇期爲他俩完成那結婚典禮。魯伯勤隨也接着郵局通知，己改派在北平總局服務，生活問題也不生什麽影響。　　遇一天，北平郵局還特爲他們從東北來的同志們，開了個慰勞會。魯伯勤在會塲中到處亂跑着，忽聽得一位舊同事正在旁人面前對他施一種背地的譏訕：　　「只有小魯划得來，在國難以及我們全體遭難的時期中，竟誘騙到手一個很美麗的老婆。」原來現時己到了安閒的地步，他們又能談論是非算計舊賬了！　　但魯伯勤似聽得當頭一聲大霹靂，在汗流浹背很不自安呢。不等會議散塲，即急忙跑回家，當堂兄和一貞的面，把今天聽來的話覆説了一徧，便毅然提出個堅决的主張：　　「那知道我還是免了卑怯啊！但我决不是無心肝的人，總應該訂一個辦法糾正。從此後我上郵局工作，一貞便自去專心上學，婚禮一節，暫不舉行，須等到東北收復那一天，才能寛現，以免旁人議論我只知私愛。唉！東北未復，何以家爲！我當先天下之憂而憂，後天下之樂而樂，勉做個興亡有責的匹夫啊！」　　於是魯大年和佟一貞一齊低下頭來，都相對默然然了。？　　這篇小説的結束，便只是右邊小標題那個無定的問號。究竟東北何日收復？這一雙愛侣何日結婚？或永遠東北不收復？他俩也永遠不結婚？抑或又另有其他的變通與變化？姑且都視爲悠久存在的問題罷。（完）</p>

<p>製法先將硼砂同皂粉加適量的蒸溜水，煑沸使其溶化，然後將玫塊水與臘芬水，徐徐加入硼砂同皂粉的溶液體中，以棒不停的攪拌，使其混和均匀，入瓶密封，即可應用。使用時傾此水約一匙於洗面水中，洗濯頭髮，能去油垢，不傷髮光，用香氣襲入。　　生髮膏的製法　　原料橄欖油八盎斯，精製猪油七盎斯，白臘一盎斯，橙花油二十滴，百給没篤油二格林，玫瑰油三十滴，　　製法先將橄欖油猪和白臘混合鍋中，加熱待其溶化，不斷攪拌，使其均和，待至半冷後，將橙花油百給没篤油及玫瑰油一同加入，（因過熱時將香料加入，往往容易使香氣飛散，故不可不注意的，）香料加入後，再行充分拌匀即得，把牠由鍋中倒入瓶内，就可使用。　　脱髮膏的製法：　　原料硫酸　二十兛，冰糖一兛蒸溜水一兛，檸檬油三十克，其他香料十克，　　制法先將冰糖溶化於蒸溜水中，加入硫酸鈣（即石膏）充分拌匀，繼又加入檸檬油，待冷却時加入其他香料混和，入瓶密封，勿使漏氣，即得。若久露空氣中，就漸失其效力。使用時將此膏塗擦鬚部，經一夜洗去，於是約一星期，鬚自脱落，女子欲去鬚毛，亦可用之。　　黑色染毛髮藥水的製法：　　原料醋酸鉛三克，次亞硫酸鈉十二克·油三十克·纯酒精三十克，蒸溜水四百克，　　製法先將醋酸鉛和硫酸鈉各溶於少量蒸溜水中，而於其餘之蒸溜水中加入甘油及酒精，將牠密和後，就注入硫酸鈉溶液，充分攪拌，然後徐徐注入醋酸鈉溶液，隨注意拌，置於蘆色玻璃瓶中，並包以黑色紙，静置二十四早時，取其澄清液，刷於髮部，日用一次，就自然轉黑。　　艶髮水的制法：　　原料鉀肥皂二十四份，碳酸鉀五份，純酒精四十八份，蒸溜水四百份，　　製法先將鉀肥皂切成細片，加蒸溜水温之，繼加碳酸鉀，待完全溶化，放冷，加酒精，充分拌攪即得。用此水洗髮，久之光可鑑人。改良社會討論會我亦一談新家庭與社會改良問題  文炳　　劈頭便須認清，社會的良窳，是取决政治制度尤取决於社會的經濟結搆，人類固然是製作工具和創造時代的動物，但就其單别生活而言，却又大部份跳不出社會環境的支配，所以我覺得改良社會政治，若只説某一部份或某樁小事的改良，無疑地都是很難奏效，不客氣點説，由個人或某一部份做起的論調，不是夢中的囈語，也便是徒勞的廢話、所以稍有見解的人，絶不説，也不相信，中國的出路，可由小處做起所能見效的·試看近年以來，名流要人呐喊什麽「簡約」，「勤儉」，所得的效果如何？馮大帥曾在北平某紀念節時特紥「節儉」兩個大花宇，自己行武數十年，也總算布衣草履，粗食自甘，然而他的僚屬怎樣，還不是與普通的一樣麽·背了馮的臉，大家都換紥缎鞋，絲襪，所謂布衣草履，只是謁見馮大帥時的晃子罷了，不久以前，聶曾紀芬氏曾在某大報發表過長長大篇的「廉儉救國説」，效力如何？諸如此類，誠使人浩嘆徒勞！　　同樣，個人及家庭雖然是國家的基礎，但並不能説改良家庭，就可把社會環境改良，政治澄清，基此，所以我讀了王明星君的「讀新家庭的標準之我見」，無限欽孜，而於昨日（二十五）高卓雲君的「新家庭與社會改良問題」，則頗有點懷疑，用敢謭陋不辭，略加檢討。　　高君的意思，以爲家庭，個人，是國家的組成份子，要國家弄得好，須由個人及家庭做起，因此大前提之根本動摇，所以演釋下來的大套話，也就有些站不住脚跟，　　高君説：「：不在家庭，則非也，蓋社會之组織，人民其首要也，人民智識之深淺，體力之强弱，習慣之好歹，其與國家關係之重要，可不待言而噲也，…改良教育，…革善娱樂，何一而可少耶？…兒童呱呱墮地後，家庭即爲其初入之環境也，…兒童即將來社會柱石，兒童之良好與否，即爲社會之良好與否也，」這種説法，偶然看之，似乎高明，但是我要問：處中國的現社會環境，新家庭能夠産生麽？即使能鋔，子弟在家庭中固然養成得良好了，然一踏進社會之門，也定會被惡劣的社會環境所染化丨人民固然是社會的組成者，社會若没有人民做角色，自然無所謂社會的存在，但其良好與否，端視整個的法制以爲斷，人民智識之邁進，體力之加强，習慣之改良，直接固賴教育，體育，娱樂之提倡，然而教育等之良好與否，須知尤賴社會環境，國家法制，高君爲什麽不進説到這一層？只説教育，家庭，影響兒童，兒童影響社會呢？原來高君只見到問題的一截或一方面呵·　　中國革命之流産，固爲思想陳舊者作梗所致，然由事實所昭示，今後中國革命果可從心理建設而完成？盧梭的名言，也不過就教育範疇而立論也。　　高君既以現政治之不良，引爲痛心疾首，	然而只説：「從大處着眼，小處做起」的莫須靠的辦法，誠不知中國要何年何月才能翻身？有當前唯一出路的「做官制度」，所以人人都立志做大官，不做大事，孫中山先生的話只是婆心一片，母奈聽者藐藐！　　至高君説：「我們既是　（丨）無勢無力之平民，國家大事無權（丨）干涉」·假如四萬萬同胞都作如是觀·那可糟了·東北既己失了，人民固無須干問，即使當局再割賣，甚至把整個的中國都送掉，那也可以，這還了得！我且問高君一句：國家主體的人民，果眞無權干問國家大事麽·　　「夫家庭，人人有也，改良家庭亦人人能做也，故吾意欲望國家政治清明，先自改良家庭始·」這是高君的結論，可惜人人都不不能如高君所説的去做，即使去做，也要被軍閥摧殘，破産流亡。　　總之，我覺得中國的政治問题，己到了最嚴重的關頭，絶不是局部的小問題，即使苦力從小處做起，如新家庭出現，也决抵不過惡劣的社會環境，遑言澄清政治—反之·有了新政治，則新家庭也就應連而興了—所以我的結論完全與王明星君的相同。學校生活之一情書片斷  綺懷　情書一名詞，不知陶醉了多少青年，耗費了多少光陰，任是你明天忙得要大考，但按期的情書，却不可不寫，并且情書上的字跡，决不潦草的。　　滬上有一大學，學生的信，都由每級的郵務長，向校中郵務處領取後，然後分發，這樣苦了一般有情書的學生每次的甜心來信，往往先給郵務長先見，所以他們，便設法，在校中郵務處，納費若干，租得一信箱。有時，也有設法私自請請郵務長的客，這樣，每次信來時，郵務長，便塞在這人手中，不再公開，俾衆周知了，因情書，是學校中給人敲竹槓的利器，往往有情書一封，請客一排，等論調。有時竟把情書扣住，借此勒索咧！　　某人新有了一個女朋友，給一般固學們，打聽得後，他們就十分注意着，她的第一封信。假使把他扣住了，往往可得大菜一客，及其他很豐富的代價，以資報酬。　　滬上再有一女學校，學生們的信，都經學監一一檢查，凡有情書，都一一的加封，把他寄到各該生的家中，這來，末免太煞風景了。但一般斵輪老手，他們能應用暗語，一看似普通的信，按了暗語，却是一絶妙的情書，這來，學監們其如之何？　　有一位女學生，交際很廣，情書差不多每天都有，她便按日排表的，一一答覆，信末，她總這樣寫着：　　「記着！與我通信的，只有你一人一般女學生們，見了愛人們的情書來後，有人却偷偷的拆閲，私自欣慰：有人却故意的，令人知道，可顯示自己己有了愛人，借此自豪，假使她是一校的校花，她的信，一定如雪片的多，她往往把他公開的，任人取讀，不加十分的注意了。　　學校中，再有僞造情書的事，假使知道某人，正渴想着他女友的信，狡黠的學生們，便偷偷的造了一封，投入郵筒，然後把他扣住，故意的令他知道，他女友的信，己來，便借此要挾，一等客請完，信拿着，雖係膺的，然己悔之晚矣！來函　　謹啓者，查本月二十一日之貴報「科學常識」欄内，刋有司丹康之製造法一稿，今爲中國總經理威廉華納公司所見，來函聲稱，此稿所述之製造完全錯誤，且「司丹康」三字係註册商標，不得擅用，今貴報暨用其名，又將其製法登錯　應即加更正，克勞廣告公司啓，十月廿六日</p>

<p>Yesterday, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech in Milan, stating that within ten years, Fascism would spread throughout Europe, with Italy as its center. He concluded by saying that the way to restore the world's health does not lie in frequent meetings. What Italy desires is fewer meetings but more resolutions, fewer proposals but more construction.</p>
<p>Whether Fascism will be adopted by all of Europe within ten years, and whether Mr. Mussolini's words are entirely based on rational arguments without any exaggeration, are not what we wish to discuss today. We only feel unspeakable astonishment at the last two phrases, "fewer meetings but more resolutions, fewer proposals but more construction." In his view, it is a deeply pretentious expression. In our view, it becomes a revelation of the very core of the problem. Reading this makes one blush with shame and deep emotion. Looking around at the nations of the world, is there any country more unhealthy than our own today? Is a political situation with the most meetings and the least construction not a unique phenomenon in our country?</p>
<p>Let's not talk about local administration. As for the central government, there are departmental meetings, Executive Yuan meetings, Legislative Yuan meetings, National Government meetings, Central Political Council meetings, and Central Standing Committee meetings, stacked upon each other endlessly. If formal regular meetings are not enough, they are supplemented by tea parties and ad hoc meetings. Expanded versions include plenary sessions of the Central Executive Committee and national representative conferences. Added to this are the National Economic Conference,</p>
<p>National Internal Affairs Conference, National People's Food Conference, and various other ad hoc meetings. There is also the National Crisis Conference and special foreign affairs committees, a dazzling array too numerous to mention. The sheer number of meetings is truly astounding.</p>
<p>With such a constant stream of meetings, one would expect at least a few resolutions to comfort the people's eager anticipation of good governance. With such overlapping institutions, one would expect at least a prudent approach to alleviate our suffering, even if only in a small way. However, what we long for only sees the regular Yuan meetings being rehearsed day after day. Aside from reshuffling a few political personnel, there are very few resolutions that benefit the people's livelihood. As for slightly difficult events, the Yuan refers them to the Central Political Council, which refers them to the Central Standing Committee. If the Central Standing Committee still cannot decide, they gather various Central Committee members to exchange opinions and widely solicit views. If they still cannot decide, the matter is left for the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee to decide, or directly returned to the original agency for reconsideration. The report goes up and is sent back down, resulting in extremely tortuous results. The crux of the problem may not be fully resolved. Resolutions are so difficult to obtain. As for construction, whenever a major conference is convened, talented individuals gather. Discussions flow like springs, and proposals are loaded by the cartload. The postal and telegraph services are exhausted from delivery, and newspapers struggle to cover everything. Then, we hear that the proposals have been organized, submitted for review, discussed, shelved, revised and passed, and handed over to the government for implementation. Finally, the conference closes. Once the conference closes, our hopes also come to an end. Empty mountains, no people seen, only the sound of voices heard, is a true reflection of our country's meetings.</p>
<p>What we find particularly strange is that the committee members attending various meetings mostly have overlapping roles. For example, many members of the Foreign Affairs Committee are also members of the Central Political Council. To say that an event that the Foreign Affairs Committee cannot resolve can be resolved by the Central Political Council, or that an opinion that cannot be contributed in the Central Political Council can be expressed in the Foreign Affairs Committee, is not this a ridiculous and laughable matter? Government officials, usually unprepared for any contingencies, resort to propaganda as a shield when faced with urgent situations and public criticism. Today, Committee Member A releases a statement saying that a certain case has been resolved. Tomorrow, Important Person B issues a statement saying that a certain matter has a correct plan. They only aim for immediate peace and quiet, disregarding factual proof. This is like the monkey keeper's trick of four in the morning and three in the evening. The effectiveness of meetings is becoming increasingly limited.</p>
<p>In short, if there are many meetings but no resolutions, it is better not to meet. If there are many proposals but no construction, it is better not to propose. Without meetings and proposals, we might still hope to solve difficult problems through meetings and carry out construction according to proposals one day. If we are in meetings every day, and no progress can be seen, if there is an abundance of speech, but no one takes responsibility, if we plan buildings without success, how far are we from restoring health? Mr. Mussolini's words can be used as a source of inspiration for improvement. The evening drum and morning bell awaken deep reflection in the gentlemen of the government. Listen carefully, listen carefully.</p>

<p>Jiang Bocheng Arrives in Jinan, Fruitful Results from Further Consultations with Han</p>
<p>The Third Route Army Decides to Complete Withdrawal by the 8th; Yantai and Longkou Temporarily Return to Naval Defense</p>
<p>Jiang, Xiong, and Gao Supervise the Withdrawal of Troops by Both Sides; The Location Where Liu's Troops Will be Transferred is Undecided</p>
<p>(Jinan) At 9:00 AM this morning, Jiang Bocheng arrived in Jinan. Han and other important figures welcomed him at the station. After Jiang disembarked, he went to the Jiaoji Hotel with Han to discuss solutions for Jiaodong with Zhang Fang. In the morning, He Yingqin's reply telegram arrived in Jinan, leading to further consultations with satisfactory results, and everyone was delighted. Jiang told reporters: 1. The withdrawal of the First and Third Route Armies is overdue. Han requested a delay of several days. Minister He replied in a telegram that as long as General Xiang Fang could withdraw the Third Route Army west of the Weifang River, a slight delay of a few days would be acceptable. It has now been agreed with Han that the withdrawal will be completed by August 8th. 2. Yantai and Longkou will temporarily return to the defense of the Northeast Navy to facilitate the transfer of Liu's troops from these two locations. 3. In addition to Fushan, Muping, Qixia, Laiyang, and Ye County, where Liu's troops will temporarily be stationed, the Third Route Army will leave a small number of troops in Wendeng, Rongcheng, Penglai, Huang County, Zhaoyuan, Haiyang, and Pingdu to maintain order together with the Shandong local militia because of the existing bandits. 4. The Central Government has sent me, Xiong Bin, and Gao Lingbai to supervise the withdrawal and transfer of troops by both sides. I plan to ask Xiong to go to Ye County, Gao to Yantai, and I will stay in Jinan. 5. After the Third Route Army completes its withdrawal on the 8th, an order will be issued to transfer Liu away from Shandong. The destination is unknown. In this way, the prestige of the central government and the suffering of the local people can both be taken into account. This matter can be considered resolved. Gao has arrived in Jinan, but Xiong has not yet come. Zhang Fang plans to go to Qingdao tomorrow. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The entire Shandong provincial government committee and the secretary-general hosted a banquet at the People's Hall for Jiang Bocheng and Zhang Fang. Han said that the Third Route Army would withdraw to the Pingdu and Changyi area. Liu's troops were being driven out by local governments and people. If I were in Liu's position, I would have asked to leave voluntarily. The areas within 20-30 miles of Laiyang and the city gates of Ye County have been severely damaged by Liu's troops, and the provincial government will have to assist in their recovery in the future. The port of Yantai is excellent, and if the population is about the same, it will not be difficult to compete with Qingdao after proper reorganization. I believe that the central government should first assist in unifying provincial administrations in various provinces, and then the central government will be unified. Han decided to personally visit Chiang in Wuhan and request punishment after the Jiaodong matter is resolved. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Undercover Teams Inside the City Are Very Active</p>
<p>Zhang Dianjiu's Army Reaches the Opposite Bank of the Nen River</p>
<p>(Harbin) Although the Japanese army and Fu Zhaolin are likely to reach an agreement, the Northeast Righteous Armies have formed a siege around Heihe, advancing on Heihe from the north from Heihe, from the south from the Nen River, and from the west from Fularji. The contact between Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, and Li Haiqing is very close. Undercover teams inside Heihe are very active, and leaflets denouncing the Japanese and traitors are found everywhere. Public morale is shaken, and many in the puppet army are responding in a timely manner. Upon hearing this news, the Japanese have been conferring daily to discuss countermeasures. Heihe is in imminent danger. (29th China United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>A portion of Zhang Dianjiu's army from Qiqihar, about 500 men, suddenly appeared on the opposite bank of the Nen River outside Qiqihar, preparing to cross the river and advance on Qiqihar.

<p>(Beiping) A person from Manchuria reported that since Su Bingwen launched his campaign in Hailar on the 28th of last month, he has completely monitored the Japanese residents in Hailar and Manchuria. The Japanese military authorities, unaware of the truth, sent someone to Hailar secretly to persuade him, but Su sternly refused. Recently, Japanese planes have been scattering threatening leaflets in the Hailar-Manchuria area, but the National Salvation Army is not paying much attention because they were prepared. Su personally swore an oath in Hailar, declaring his determination to recover the territory, and secretly sent representatives to various places to contact Ma Zhanshan and the Heilongjiang army, agreeing on a date for a general offensive. As the military situation of various armies is making progress, the Japanese have begun to understand that Su's army is fighting against Japan, and they have urgently deployed Matsuki Tadaaki's 14th Division to Heilongjiang. For the sake of long-term resistance, Su's army has built defenses in the large mountains along the Chinese Eastern Railway line from Zhalantun to Hailar, with extremely careful arrangements.

The Japanese army, due to the high mountains and steep ridges between Nanling and Koubeiyingzi, abandoned its plan to invade Rehe along the Jinzhou-Chaoyang Road. Recently, the Japanese army has been using several thousand Mongolian troops from Tongliao to attempt to create disturbances. Cui Xingwu, the brigade commander of the Rehe army stationed in Kailu, is actively defending and contacting Feng Zhanhai's troops to guard the Rehe border. Defenses are solid.

They returned the next day but were beaten back after we fiercely struck them, killing more than 10 and they fled in disarray, using the Babeizi Palace as a stronghold. That Mongol accepted the Japanese and opposed us, harboring the Japanese army. Otherwise, we would have completely annihilated the enemy on the 15th.

On the 27th, Russia fully accepted Japan's request and decided to send several negotiators from the Kwantung Army, assisted by Major Yamaoka Michitake, an adjutant infantry officer stationed in Moscow, and Russian officials, to negotiate exclusively with Su Bingwen to rescue all the detained Japanese. Although the military hopes for a peaceful resolution, it is determined to use force as a last resort if Su continues to maintain his anti-Manchuria and anti-Japanese stance.

<p>Including Appendices, Packed in Three Large Boxes</p>
<p>To be Delivered to the National Government by Minister Arima</p>
<p>▲ Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: Japan's opinion on the Lytton Report and 76 types of related documents are packed, sealed into three boxes, and shipped to Shanghai today by Nagasaki Maru to Minister Arima, who will then deliver it to the National Government.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: Ambassador Yoshida, carrying the opinion on the Lytton Report, departed from Tokyo Station on the night of the 28th via Siberia to Geneva. Before his departure, he expressed the following opinions to reporters at Tokyo Station: Regarding the Manchurian problem, there are various speculations, but in reality, one cannot be optimistic or pessimistic. The League of Nations will inevitably use the report as a basis for handling the Sino-Japanese dispute. However, it cannot be easily resolved in either the Council or the General Assembly. Regardless of the various discussions on the report, it cannot be discarded. In short, Japan must use its advantageous points, such as the report containing the complex situation in Manchuria and the historical background, which has caused British representative Sir Cecil to change his attitude. Therefore, the Council will not dare to regard Japan as an aggressor as before. As for Japan's position in Manchuria, it is argued that there are special political and economic circumstances, which no other country in the world has. Japan must not lightly overlook such impractical theories. Furthermore, Lytton himself has recognized that Chapters Nine and Ten of the report need to be changed in the face of the ever-changing situation. Therefore, the Council cannot but fully consider this point. As for the description of the September 18th Incident and the establishment of "Manchukuo," our country will resolutely not recognize them. The launch of our right of self-defense can be explained in detail. The establishment of "Manchukuo" is based on the self-determination of 30 million people, which goes without saying. A survey team that only stayed in Manchuria for six weeks, of course, cannot observe correctly. I can arrive in Geneva on the 14th. If I cannot make it in time, the opinion may be transported by plane first, it is said.</p>

<p>New Evidence Obtained Regarding Chemical Plant Manufacturing Poison Gas</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Berlin, 28th: In February of last year, a communist worker was arrested for stealing industrial secrets and selling them to the Soviet Union. The case is currently being heard in the Leipzig Supreme Court. It is now known that what the defendant leaked was not industrial secrets but military secrets. New evidence has been obtained regarding the German chemical plant's manufacturing of military supplies. According to Article 171 of the Treaty of Versailles, "All asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and all analogous liquids, materials or devices are prohibited, the manufacture and importation of which are therefore strictly forbidden in Germany. The equipment specially designed for the manufacture, storage or use of the said articles or devices shall also be strictly forbidden."</p>

<h3 id="e45">Japanese Communist Party Case, After 128 Court Sessions, is Adjudicated <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>185 Defendants</p>
<p>Sentenced to Varying Terms of Imprisonment</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 29th: Japan's large-scale arrest of communists four years ago has finally been adjudicated today. A total of 185 people have been sentenced. Four people have been sentenced to life imprisonment, including Sano, who was arrested in Shanghai three years ago. Fourteen people have been sentenced to imprisonment for ten to fifteen years, and the rest have also been sentenced to imprisonment for terms ranging from two to nine years. When the presiding judge handed down the sentence, he said that the Japanese Communist Party is a branch of the Third International, and the defendants have all engaged in revolutionary struggles, aiming to establish a labor dictatorship.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: The sentencing of 185 members of the Second Communist Party, which has undergone 128 trials since June of last year, was pronounced by Judge Miyagi at the Tokyo District Court at 9:00 am today. At that time, the courthouse was heavily guarded by 300 armed police and 150 military police. The 60 spectator tickets were monopolized by right-wing groups such as the Patriotic Student League. The defendants looked back at the spectator seats, seemingly surprised. During the sentencing, the defendants were divided into groups A and B. Group A was sentenced in the morning, and Group B was sentenced in the afternoon. Except for the 26 people whose sentences were suspended, the others were all sentenced to imprisonment. Those who were severely punished are as follows: Party Central Committee Chairman Sano Manabu, life imprisonment; Party Central Committee member and Central Union Minister Nabe Osada Chika, life imprisonment; Party Central Committee member and Hokkaido Local Committee Chairman Mitamura Shiro, death penalty; Party Central Committee member and Executive Committee Chairman Ichikawa Shoichi, life imprisonment; Party Central Committee member Fukumoto Kazuo, ten years imprisonment; Party Central Committee members Sugiura Keiichi and Kawada Kenji, both imprisoned for ten years (as requested by the prosecutor); Takahashi Sadae and Kuninryo Goichiro, both sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment (according to the prosecutor's request).</p>
<h3 id="e46">New Legal Disarmament Plan <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Advocates German Dissolution of Defense Forces</p>
<p>As a Condition for Acknowledging Reduction of Conscription</p>
<p>International Treaties of Mutual Assistance Should Be Concluded</p>
<p>Disputes Must Be Subject to Compulsory Arbitration</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Paris, 28th: France's new security and disarmament plan, which includes important proposals from several countries, was discussed in the National Assembly today. After Herriot explained in detail, it was passed by a vote of 430 to 20. It includes a general disarmament consultation convention, which is expected to be signed by the United States as well. In addition, there are several conventions, all concerning the control of local mutual assistance armaments. There is also a plan to organize an international air force under the management of the League of Nations. However, France's overall plan only outlines the main points, and the detailed plan is still to be discussed. As for Germany's demand for equal armaments, Herriot advocated for negotiating a record of the meeting to recognize it in principle, but mutual concessions are required. Germany should also abolish its defense forces in exchange for France further reducing military service. He believes that with the proposed conventions as a guarantee, this point should not be difficult to resolve satisfactorily. If international disputes arise, then according to the French plan, compulsory arbitration must be used. In addition, Herriot also advocated for establishing a permanent international committee to conduct on-site investigations of armaments in various countries. The committee should have full power to conduct investigations and, if it finds any obvious violations, report them to the League of Nations, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 28th: The French government has recently released a summary of the outline of the plan for disarmament and security. The main idea is that France acknowledges shortening the term of military service and making it universal from a certain period, subject to the following conditions: (1) All armed groups, such as the German defense forces, whose terms of service are longer, should be regarded as domestic police forces and suppressed; (2) An international inspection system should be established, which must include the right of search; (3) Local mutual assistance treaties should be concluded between countries to supplement the deficiencies of the Locarno Treaty, so that all European countries can participate in the guarantee of peace and make the international community have sufficient public force to prevent acts of aggression. This international force should include the first batch of troops, jointly composed of teams specially trained for this purpose by various countries. This force can be dispatched immediately in case of emergency and is equipped with the strongest armaments; (4) The United States should also provide security guarantees, the method of which should be considered by the country itself; (5) All member states of the League of Nations should acknowledge and fulfill all obligations stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant; (6) All those who acknowledge mutual assistance treaties should accept compulsory arbitration.</p>

<p>Reconciling Continental Countries' Opinions on Disarmament</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 28th: US disarmament representative Davis arrived in Paris from London at 5:45 pm.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 28th: According to well-informed sources, US representative Davis has reported the details of his talks with British Prime Minister MacDonald, Foreign Secretary Simon, and Japanese Ambassador to the UK Matsudaira to Washington. It is unknown whether he has received a reply from his government before going to Paris.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, London, 28th: Semi-official sources believe that the result of the negotiations between US representative Davis and the British authorities is only to clarify the proposals of the three signatory countries of the London Naval Treaty. This is evidenced by the somewhat vague declaration of US representative Davis. Therefore, in reality, these negotiations have not achieved any current effect, and the Japanese proposal, which is still secret, does not seem to simplify the problem. Furthermore, the elements of the naval problem are not only in the mutual views of the UK, US, and Japan. Davis's intention is to pay particular attention to the opinions of the continental countries on this problem. It is recalled that when the London Naval Conference was held in 1930, the opinions of the continental countries could not be reconciled, especially between France and Italy, which the United States deeply regretted. Some people therefore believe that Davis may come to the UK again after visiting the continent.</p>

<p>First Review Three Reports</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 28th: The presidium of the Disarmament Conference decided to meet on November 3rd and issued invitations tonight. The agenda will begin with a report by Chairman Henderson on the general situation of disarmament work, followed by a review of the reports by Belgian representative Bourquin, Italian representative Pilotti, and Spanish representative on tanks (prepared by Uruguayan representative Piro). The first three reports have been studied by the presidium. Belgian representative Bourquin's report studies the powers of the Armaments Supervisory Committee and the organizational and operational conditions of such supervision. The Italian representative's report advocates for the establishment of a special supervisory committee to be responsible for studying the manufacturing of chemicals specifically for military use. From this, it can be seen that the Italian representative's report is more detailed than the Belgian representative's report, because Bourquin only proposed working methods, while Pilotti reached a conclusion. The report of the Spanish representative Madariaga studies air armaments, but only re-examines the problem of supervising civilian aircraft that can be used for aerial bombing. He intends to provide adequate protection to civilians from the danger of aerial bombing, so he advocates for supervising civilian aviation to prevent it from being converted for military use.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Proposals to Ban Chemical Warfare <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Geneva, 28th: Italian representative Pilotti today submitted several proposals regarding the implementation of a ban on various chemical, incendiary, and bacteriological warfare to Disarmament Conference Chairman Henderson. The proposals first prohibit preparations during peacetime, such as manufacturing such materials and issuing usage instructions. Then, a chemical group should be established within the Permanent Disarmament Committee and given full power to deal with violators. If a country is accused of violating the agreement, it will go to the site for investigation. If it is indeed true, sanctions will be imposed. Regarding the method of sanctions, one provision allows for pressure to be applied to the violating country, first ordering it to abandon the prohibited weapons and depriving it of the possibility of continuing to use them. Then, the countries will negotiate punitive methods and send suggestions and prohibitions to the warring countries. The final step is to allow the victim country to retaliate, but its scope of use must not exceed the actual conflict area.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Madrid, 28th: The International Transportation Conference Special Committee passed a new draft of the telegram inspection clause proposed by the US representative today. The clause is Article 25 of the original agreement, stipulating that the signatory governments reserve the right to stop the transmission of wired and wireless communications that are deemed to endanger national security, violate public order laws, and be contrary to etiquette. However, if transmission is stopped, the originating telegraph station should be notified immediately, except when such notification would endanger national security. The US representative believes that this provision can adequately protect government rights and public interests. Representatives from China, Japan, Czechoslovakia, and Austria advocated for expanding the scope of inspection and proposed amendments, but the committee deemed it unnecessary to expand and did not adopt them.</p>

<h3 id="e52">The World's Rural Plight, US Grain Bins Overflowing <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Wheat Prices are the Lowest in Centuries</p>
<p>Farmers are Even Using it as Fuel</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 28th: While the US Customs Bureau is filled with petitions from various industries complaining about the dumping of foreign goods, which costs US industrialists millions of dollars each year, it is reported from Chicago today that all grain bins in the US are suffering from an overflow of wheat. Regardless of the price, they are willing to sell as long as it is exported abroad. The prices of wheat and corn are so low that remote villages would rather use them as fuel than transport them to the market for sale. The price of corn in the US is currently only $14.50 per ton. In areas west of the Allegheny Mountains, the value of high-quality coal is still more than this amount, so farmers now believe that transporting corn to the market is a waste of labor and gasoline. It is better to use it as fuel, which can save the cost of transporting coal home. The vast grain bins set up by the US government are now filled with grain waiting to be exported, and sales prices are actually being negotiated. It is reported that several European countries have placed large orders with the US, so corn and wheat prices have risen slightly today. However, competition for export trade among several major wheat-producing countries is fierce, and it is feared that orders will decrease again after the market price rises slightly. According to agricultural experts, the world's wheat production is currently 1.2 billion bushels, while the world's demand is only 750 million bushels. With this huge surplus, wheat prices will definitely be difficult to rise for a while. Since the 17th century, wheat prices have never been as low as they are today. Therefore, although Americans deeply abhor destroying finished goods, this time they consider burning corn as firewood not surprising.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, London, 29th: The Russian Black Sea Express recently derailed on October 16, killing 90 people and injuring 300. It was apparently ordered by the Soviet Russian authorities to ban its publication.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was not until today that it was transmitted abroad.

According to a report by Koroleev, the Korler Daily News published the above details and said that according to a passenger on the derailed train, six cars in front at that time had overturned.</p>

The celebration on that day will follow Stalin's intentions, with radio broadcasts as the main body of propaganda. Military Commissioner Voroshilov will give a speech to the Red Army throughout Soviet Russia. All military camps throughout the country, from the Polish border to the Far East, will be equipped with radio receivers. At that time, the entire Red Army will line up and listen quietly to Voroshilov's speech. However, according to Stalin's opinion, Voroshilov will not make excessively激烈的言辭言辭, so as not to arouse the antipathy of other countries.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Japanese in Great Confusion After Su and Zhang Raise the Banner of Righteousness <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>▲ Fearing Danger to Japanese Residents</p>
<p>▲ And Guarding Against Soviet Union Involvement</p>
<p>▲ Military Certainty Lacking</p>
<p>▲ Efforts to Appease Ineffective</p>
<p>A special dispatch from outside the Pass (Guandong): Traffic between Harbin and Manchouli on the Chinese Eastern Railway has been cut in two since Man Hai raised the banner of righteousness on September 29th. Telephone and telegraph communications are completely severed. The Japanese are extremely anxious, concerned about the safety of their residents. However, aircraft cannot directly fly to Manchouli for reconnaissance. News from the Man Hai area relies on reports from the Soviet Consul in Manchouli, Strunov, to Blagoveshchensk, and then relayed from Blagoveshchensk to Vladivostok before reaching Harbin. Japan suspects that the Man Hai incident has some background involving the Soviet Union, but they dare not offend them at this moment. Firstly, they are concerned about the severed communications and the danger to the lives of their residents. Secondly, they fear that the Soviet Union might actually assist Su Bingwen and launch a large-scale offensive, making the situation even more serious. Therefore, although they are extremely dissatisfied with the Soviet Union, they dare not show it. Although the Kwantung Army headquarters has declared it will take decisive action, it has hesitated for many days, not daring to act immediately. On October 15th, three aircraft flew to Hailar, aiming to bomb the aircraft parked at the Chinese Eastern Railway's materials factory. This aircraft was shot down by Su Bingwen's troops at Qiqihar on September 28th while conducting reconnaissance over Manchouli. The Japanese military wanted to destroy it to prevent it from being used by the Soviet army. They dropped ten 50-pound bombs and fourteen 25-pound bombs, but none hit the target. Su Bingwen, fearing they would drop bombs on the city streets, ordered soldiers to drive out 30 Japanese residents and make them stand in the main thoroughfare. The Japanese aircraft, seeing their residents and fearing they would be affected, ceased bombing and left. They returned and reported to the Qiqihar headquarters, but there was no suitable solution. Therefore, they have been hoping to resolve the matter through political means, planning to deceive the residents into leaving and then taking military action. Matsuki Naohiro, the commander of the Japanese 14th Division, arrived in Qiqihar from Harbin on the 19th to prepare for military action. Meanwhile, he sent Jin Xianli (the twelfth son of Puwei), the puppet mayor of Qiqihar, to Hailar to persuade Su Bingwen to return to the puppet state, promising to pay the owed military expenses, etc. Jin Xianli planned to travel by plane on the 21st with two Japanese military staff officers. On one hand, the Japanese military gathered forces, one force heading directly south along the railway line towards Zhujia Kan and Nianzishan, but has not yet engaged in battle with Su and Zhang's troops. Another force, consisting of 6,000 cavalry and artillery, made a large detour around Nianzishan, heading towards Zhalantun, the location of the deputy headquarters of Zhang Dianjiu of the Northeast Army. In addition to actively deploying defensive measures, Su Bingwen maintained written communications, feigning compliance with the Japanese military. He also replied agreeing to the Japanese side sending Jin Xianli as a representative. However, the Japanese side, having detected that foreign military experts were assisting Su's army, laying landmines in the Xing'anling mountain passes, and constructing artillery positions in the Boketu Mountains to resist if Zhalantun could not be held, considered advancing on Man Hai to be extremely difficult. The Japanese side also discovered that Guo Daofu, the leader of the Mongolian Youth Party, was actively in contact with Su Bingwen, planning to establish a new regime in the name of the Bargu-Buryat Republic in the northwest of Hulunbuir. Recently, the Youth Party has sent many propagandists from the Hailar area, carrying affiliation documents to various Mongolian banners, requesting them to join. It is reported that over 5,700 Mongolian princes and chieftains have joined. The founding policy will imitate the Soviet Union's federal system, formed by a multitude of small republics. It is also expected that under the protection of the Soviet government, a republic will be formed by seven ethnic groups: Mongolian, Buryat, Solon, Han, Soviet, and Tatar. A constituent assembly will be held by December 25th at the latest to decide on the form of government. Su Bingwen seems to have agreed to this. With the Soviet Union providing guns and cannons, and the Red Guards under the guidance of Soviet military officers, have gathered 12,000 troops. Su Bingwen has ordered the abolition of the customs checkpoints on the Manchouli border, allowing free import of Soviet goods. The Soviet Transbaikal Railway has reallocated hundreds of railcars, divided into several trains, traveling between Man Hai. Therefore, traffic in the area is frequent, and Russian merchants and Mongols are very pleased. West of Hailar, there is a great atmosphere of development. The Japanese side, unable to obtain news from Man Hai, has telegraphed its military attaché at the embassy in Russia to enter and exit Manzhouli to gather information. Whether the Japanese military will advance westward will depend on the outcome of Jin Xianli's persuasion of Su Bingwen and the report from the military attaché at the embassy in Russia. As for traffic between Angangxi and Harbin, it has been cut off for many days due to the advance of Deng Wen's troops under Ma Zhanshan into the Anda station area.</p>
<p>Continued Dispatch from Outside the Pass: Jin Xianli, who was dispatched by the Japanese side to Hailar to persuade Su Bingwen and Zhang Dianjiu, was originally scheduled to travel by plane on the 21st with two Japanese officers. However, fearing that they would be detained by Su and Zhang, they dared not take the plane immediately. After multiple telephone consultations, Su Bingwen agreed to send a car to Zhujia Kan to receive them, meeting in Boketu or Hulunbuir. Early on the 22nd, Jin Xianli, together with two Japanese, departed. The Japanese also knew that this trip would be ineffective, but they had to take this one-in-a-million chance for the sake of rescuing their residents from danger. Yesterday, it was heard that after Jin Xianli arrived at Zhujia Kan, Su Bingwen sent a representative to wait in Zhalantun, ordering that any matters be discussed with his representative and forbidding further advancement. However, yesterday the Japanese intelligence agency here received a telegram from the Japanese embassy in Moscow,</p>
<p>stating that they had received a telegram from the Soviet Consul General in Manchouli, Strunov, stating that he had received a reply from Su Bingwen in the name of Commander-in-Chief of the National Salvation Army, agreeing to consider the Japanese request to release Japanese residents relayed by the Russian Consul. He plans to release Japanese women, children, and some Japanese officials who did not participate in the anti-resistance military actions and were not full of Zhou government officials in the near future, handing them over to the Russian Consul and withdrawing from the White Russian territory. The deadline is not certain. After receiving this information, the Japanese side believed that there was hope for this matter to be resolved and therefore paid attention to Jin Xianli's meeting with Su Bingwen's representative in Zhalantun. Currently, many train cars carrying machinery and goods are parked in Zhalantun, Boketu, Tuduhe, Zhujia Kan, and Nianzishan. Trains carrying military supplies and soldiers travel continuously between Man Hai every day. Su and Zhang's troops are completely concentrated in the Zhalantun and Zhujia Kan areas. Since Fularji fell on the 7th of this month, at 7:00 AM on the 22nd, Zhang Yuting, the commander of the main cavalry regiment of Zhang Dianjiu's troops, led his 1,000 troops, in conjunction with four detachments of Su Bingwen's army, launched a fierce counterattack. The two armies are currently fighting in the Huerhula area southeast of Fularji. The Northeast Army's attacks are very fierce. The Japanese military is holding it with two regiments, and the artillery fire from both sides has not stopped into the night. The sound of artillery fire can be heard in the Angangxi area. Recently, there has been continuous rain and snow, and Japanese aircraft have not been able to gain the upper hand by dropping bombs. As of the evening of the 23rd, the fighting was still intense. The Japanese military has suffered over one battalion of fatalities. Saito, the cavalry company commander, and Hara, the infantry battalion commander, have both been seriously wounded. The Japanese military in Qiqihar is sending reinforcements to that area. From Nianzishan upwards to Manchouli, inspection stations have been set up at every station, strictly inspecting passing pedestrians. The Northeast Army is organized very strictly, and even the slightest letter is not allowed to be secretly leaked out by good people. Therefore, the Japanese side has not been able to obtain detailed information about Su and Zhang's military strength. Pu Datong's troops in Baiquan have been reorganized into three brigades. Pu personally leads one brigade to take Keshan, and he has ordered Xu Zihe's army to advance on the Qiqihar-Keshan route, cutting off traffic at the stations of Taianzhen, Laha, and Ningnian, to cut off Japanese reinforcements. They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the puppet state army and the Hiraga unit of the Japanese army. The Japanese military in Keshan is isolated. Wu Tianzuo's brigade and Nan Tingfang's brigade of Pu's army are besieging Kedong. Over half of the 800 Japanese troops in the city have been killed in battle, and Captain Kuroda has also been killed. It is reported that the Japanese military in Qiqihar is trying to find a way to rescue them.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Hope for Resolution of Jiaodong Issue <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>▲ Han Expresses Willingness to Withdraw Defenses First If Liu's Troops Leave Shandong</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Jiaodong issue has gradually attracted attention from all sides since Han Fuqu telegraphed the Central Government to resign. Zhang Xueliang, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, and Song Zheyuan, Chairman of Chahar Province, all sent telegrams to Jinan yesterday, urging Mr. Han to stay. Yu Xuezhong's representative, Li Junxiang, is still staying in Jinan. Han's representative, Liu Xizhong, went to Peiping (Beijing) a few days ago to report the recent situation in Jiaodong and Han's suffering of having to resign to Zhang Xueliang, Jiang Bocheng, and Song Zheyuan and other North China generals, which gained understanding from all sides. Recently, due to Jiang sending a telegram to Zhang Xueliang, instructing him to mediate the Jiaodong issue nearby, all details needed to be reported to Jinan. Liu returned to Jinan from Peiping this morning, and after getting off the train, immediately went to the Provincial Government to meet Han and report. Considering the importance of the matter, I specifically went to the Provincial Government to visit Han at noon to inquire about the details. Han said: Director Zhang (Xueliang)'s opinion is also that Liu's troops must be transferred out of Shandong, but in fact, Liu cannot be transferred until the Third Route Army withdraws its defenses. Therefore, Director Zhang intends to temporarily assign Yantai and Longkou to be garrisoned by a third party, so that Liu's troops can leave Shandong from these two places in the future. I completely agree with Director Zhang's approach. Originally, I had no grievances with Liu Ruxi, only for the sake of relieving the suffering of the people in Jiaodong. If Liu does not leave Shandong, the suffering of the people cannot be relieved. Therefore, I propose that the Third Route Army can follow orders and withdraw its defenses first, but (1) there must be a clear order for Liu's troops to leave Shandong immediately, (2) the people in Jiaodong must be able to live and work in peace. If both of these points can be achieved, the Third Route Army can withdraw its defenses first at any time so that Liu's troops can leave Shandong. Chief of Staff Jiang (Bocheng) is making great efforts to mediate this matter, and his intentions are very good. However, the three previously discussed measures: (1) The Third Route Army will withdraw to the west of the Wei River, (2) Liu's troops will not be stationed on the Yantai-Weixian line, (3) The administrative power in Liu's defense zone will be completely handed over, only the first measure was implemented, while the remaining two measures were not achieved. Therefore, I believe that the suffering of the people in Jiaodong cannot still be relieved, and the withdrawal of defenses still needs to be considered. Minister He (Yingqin)'s intentions are also very good, and the matter of withdrawing defenses is currently being discussed. Commander-in-Chief Jiang has sent Zhang Boying (Fang) to Jinan to discuss this matter. I have already sent a telegram to welcome him. Zhang is starting from Hankou this afternoon and should arrive in Jinan within two or three days. This matter will probably have a result soon. I have always believed that this is a small problem and it is not difficult to resolve. As for my resignation, various parties have sent telegrams urging me to stay, and I am grateful for their kindness. However, I have recently felt that the political responsibility is too burdensome and my personal abilities are meager and I am not up to the task. I always want to get rid of it as soon as possible. The telegrams from He Yingqin, Song Zheyuan, and others urging Han to stay are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ He Yingqin's Telegram (Urgent): To Chairman Han Xiangfang, Wanmi. I read in the newspaper that you telegraphed the Executive Yuan to resign from the positions of Chairman of Shandong Province and concurrently held positions. At this time of severe national crisis and suffering, we comrades of the Party can only do our best to help the situation. The Central Government cannot allow you to retire, and I especially do not agree with you suddenly retiring at this time. I urge you to dispel the idea of resigning and work hard for the Party and the country together. I sincerely hope and pray. He Yingqin, Seal.</p>
<p>▲ Song Zheyuan's Telegram: To Chairman Han Xiangfang, Benevolent Brother, Xunjian, Xuanmi. Your resignation and desire to leave the political sphere are understandable by the people of the country. However, at this time when foreign troubles are becoming increasingly urgent and the country's steps are becoming more difficult, all fellow soldiers should reluctantly take on difficult tasks. You are loyal to the military and the country and have always valued obedience. I still hope that you will maintain the Central Government's prestige with a spirit of concession and hope that you will not give up on overcoming difficulties. This is what I hope and pray. I arrived in Peiping from Zhangyuan on Yu Yang's day and have reported it. Song Zheyuan, Respectfully, Seal.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Xueliang's Telegram: To Chairman Han Xiangfang, Brother Xunjian, Ma Dian has been received. Times are difficult and problems are endless. The overall situation in North China relies on our joint efforts to maintain. You have indicated that you are in a difficult situation and insist on retiring. Not only will the Central Government's intentions not allow you to retire, but my humble sincerity cannot bear to see you leave midway. In short, the facts are all there, and everyone can see them. Your difficulties will eventually be fully understood. I urge you not to be overly anxious and to dispel the idea of resigning. I respectfully hope that you will consider and adopt this. This is my greatest hope. Your Brother, Zhang Xueliang, Youzi, First Seal.</p>
<p>Provincial Committee Member Zhang Yue and Valley Ziliang, commander of the 22nd Division, previously received orders from Han Fuqu to go east from Jinan, passing through Weixian, Shahe, and along the Yantai-Weixian line, to inspect Yantai. On the return journey, they also passed through Longkou, inspected, and arrived at Shahe on the 25th, where they met Cao Fulin, commander of the 29th Division. This morning, they departed from Shahe and returned to Weixian, where they met Liu Shuxiang, Chief of Staff of the Weixian Headquarters. At 2:00 PM, they returned to Jinan by armored train, arriving at Jinan at 10:00 PM. Zhang told visitors that Yantai, Longkou, and the Yantai-Weixian line were all very calm, but business was quite sluggish. Liu's troops in Yexian were constantly thinking of breaking through, and they launched another attack outwards yesterday, but were repelled by the Provincial Army. It is reported that Valley and others are scheduled to visit Han tomorrow morning to report on the inspection. (October 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Ministry of Railways Completes Plan for Yuehan Railway <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>▲ Scheduled to Open to Traffic in 1937</p>
<p>▲ Total Construction Cost Estimated at Approximately 60 Million Yuan</p>
<p>▲ Proceeding with Borrowing Boxer Indemnity Funds and Issuing Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways believes that the unfinished Yuehan Railway has had a profound and significant impact on the transportation, commerce, and culture of the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong. It has recently planned to complete the construction of this railway. However, during this time of national crisis, the central government's finances are particularly difficult. However, for the sake of the country's transportation future, the construction of this railway cannot be delayed. Therefore, it is proposed to borrow Boxer Indemnity funds and issue public bonds to raise funds. It is estimated that completing the entire Yuehan Railway project before 1937 will cost 60 million yuan in Chinese currency, equivalent to 3.76 million British pounds. The railway authorities plan to borrow 20 million yuan directly from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund and issue 40 million yuan in public bonds. The public bonds will be issued in Shanghai, China, and London, England, with the revenue of the Yuehan Railway used as collateral for future repayment of principal and interest. Gu Mengyu, the Minister of Railways, has already drafted detailed plans and has sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund for consultation. The original letter and plans are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Ministry of Railways Letter (Reply Required): With reference to your Board's Letter No. 943, which stated that the Board had resolved at its 11th Board Meeting on September 5th regarding the Ministry's proposal to borrow future Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Funds to serve as the fund for issuing Yuehan Railway public bonds, that this case is extremely important and that the Board could not object and would have the Chairman inform the Ministry of Railways to provide a detailed plan to the Board for discussion at the next meeting, the record has been made. A corresponding record has been made, and it is hoped that you will investigate and handle the matter and reply. We are submitting a proposal for borrowing future Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Funds to serve as the fund for issuing Yuehan Railway public bonds for your review and reply. This is addressed to the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund.</p>
<p>▲ Borrowing Boxer Indemnity Funds: According to the report of the British Boxer Indemnity Advisory Committee, the amount of Boxer Indemnity funds to be returned from December 1922 to 1945 is 11,186,547 British pounds. The Ministry should receive two-thirds, totaling 7,457,698 British pounds and some change. It is proposed to borrow this amount to complete the Yuehan Railway project. According to the engineering plan, the funds due from 1933 to 1936 will be directly borrowed and used. From January 1937 to December 1946 (originally until 1945, but due to annual suspensions of payment, it was moved to 1946), the future funds will be borrowed as a fund to issue public bonds, and the actual amount received will be allocated to the railway. Regarding the British Boxer Indemnity funds accumulated and due before February 1932, a contract has been negotiated and agreed upon between the Ministry and your Board to borrow and use the funds, either directly investing them in the Yuehan Railway or temporarily lending them to other railways first, with the stipulation that they be repaid and then re-borrowed by the Yuehan Railway. The unborrowed funds will still be requested for borrowing on time in the future to meet the needs of the Yuehan Railway project. Regarding all the British Boxer Indemnity funds to be received from January 1937 to December 1946, approximately 3,365,360 pounds, it is proposed to borrow them as a fund to issue public bonds. The detailed measures are approximately as follows: (1) The amount of public bonds to be issued will be based on the amount of British Boxer Indemnity funds to be received annually during the above-mentioned period, which is sufficient to repay the principal and interest of the public bonds. The total amount is set at 2.45 million pounds. (2) The location for issuing public bonds will be either in Shanghai or in London, or both, with the amount and date of allocation to be determined by the Ministry based on market conditions. (2) The actual amount received from the issuance of public bonds will be used to purchase materials in London at half the amount, in accordance with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Exchange of Notes, with the remaining half used for the domestic needs of the Yuehan project. (4) The public bonds issued with the Boxer Indemnity funds will only pay interest during the Yuehan project period before 1936, which will be paid from the railway construction account. Starting in 1937, the principal will be repaid, and interest will be paid on the face value of the outstanding bonds, all of which will be paid from the British Boxer Indemnity funds due. (5) The aforementioned public bonds will be repaid in 20 installments over ten years from 1937 to 1946, with principal and interest repaid every six months. The amount of bond notes to be repaid in each installment will be determined by the Ministry in a list. (6) The order in which the bond notes are repaid will be determined by the Ministry by drawing lots at the time, according to the amounts listed in the table. (7) The face value of the bond notes will generally be listed in British pounds, and the principal and interest will also be calculated in British pounds. (8) The issuance of bond notes and the repayment of principal and interest will be managed directly by the Ministry or entrusted to other institutions. (9) The British Boxer Indemnity funds borrowed to serve as the fund for issuing public bonds will still be paid principal and interest in accordance with the usual practice, with the Ministry and your Board signing a contract and paying principal and interest in accordance with the repayment and interest guarantee measures stipulated by your Board. (10) Every six months, your Board will allocate two-thirds of the actual Boxer Indemnity funds received to the Ministry. After the Ministry receives the Boxer Indemnity funds, the repayment of principal and interest in the future will also be based on this actual amount received. (11) The Yuehan Railway will be used as collateral for the British Boxer Indemnity loan, and the Ministry will be fully responsible for it. Before 1936, during the railway construction period, the interest to be paid will be paid from the railway construction account. After the railway opens to traffic in 1937, the principal and interest to be repaid will be paid from the operating revenue. (12) The period for repaying the British Boxer Indemnity loan will be four to six years after the Yuehan Railway is completed and opened to traffic (approximately in 1937). For the convenience of calculation, or after all the British Boxer Indemnity funds have been borrowed, repayment will begin in 1947. (13) The principal of the aforementioned Boxer Indemnity loan to be repaid by the Yuehan Railway will be paid from the railway's operating revenue and will be repaid in 20 years. The amount of principal and interest to be paid before the principal is repaid and after the principal begins to be repaid will be paid every six months. (14) The silver dollars converted from the British Boxer Indemnity loan allocated to repay the principal and interest of the public bonds will be calculated according to the average telegraphic exchange rate in Shanghai or London on the day of allocation. In the future, the principal and interest of the Boxer Indemnity will be repaid in Chinese currency silver dollars. (15) The Ministry and the Board will exchange documents to inform each other of the silver dollars converted from the British Boxer Indemnity loan and the amount of silver to be repaid in each installment in the future, and a separate table will be drawn up.</p>
<p>▲ Explanation of the Plan: The uncompleted section of the Yuehan Railway is only the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section. Among them, the section from Yunzhou to Lechang has already started construction and is nearing completion. The required funds will be budgeted separately. This plan is based on the Zhuzhou-Lechang section. According to the Ministry's recent estimate, the cost of completing this section is: (1) Construction costs: 27.5 million yuan, which is approximately 1,617,000 British pounds at a conversion rate of 17 yuan to 1 British pound. (2) Material costs: 2,145,000 British pounds. The total cost for both items is approximately 3,762,000 British pounds. The Zhuzhou-Lechang section is planned to be completed in four years starting from next year, with an average annual cost of approximately 940,500 British pounds. During the four-year period to complete the Yuehan Railway, the Ministry should receive Boxer Indemnity funds due (1933-1936) totaling 1,524,325 pounds, which will be directly borrowed and used to cover the costs of labor and materials for Zhuzhou and Lechang. Compared to the required amount, there is a shortfall of 2,237,675 British pounds. The interest of 5% to be paid on the aforementioned directly borrowed Boxer Indemnity funds during the project period will be paid from the construction account, totaling 139,188 pounds. Including the shortfall in labor and material costs, the total is 2,376,863 pounds. After the 26th year (1937), the British Boxer Indemnity funds due to be received by the Ministry are estimated at approximately 3,365,360 pounds, which will be borrowed to issue public bonds of 2.45 million pounds. At a 95% actual receipt rate, it will amount to 2,327,500 British pounds. The aforementioned public bonds will bear an interest rate of 6% during the project period, totaling 474,000 British pounds. The actual amount received from the public bonds allocated to the Yuehan project will be insufficient, and after deducting interest, there will still be a shortfall of 523,363 pounds, which will be allocated from the principal repayment item of the material purchase advances from various railways during the project period. According to the report of Wang Jingchun, the Ministry's representative, the accumulated funds in London from December 1912 to February of this year totaled 3,673,825 pounds, 14 shillings, and 4 pence. After deducting the various allocations to be made, the Ministry's share of two-thirds is 2,139,217 pounds, 16 shillings, and 3 pence. The amount that has been borrowed and is being negotiated for borrowing totals 1,310,000 pounds, leaving a balance of 929,217 pounds that has not been borrowed. The Xiang-E and Guang-Shao sections of the Yuehan Railway, in addition to the uncompleted Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section, both need to be renovated. It was originally planned to borrow 350,000 pounds of Boxer Indemnity funds for the Xiang-E renovation costs and 100,000 pounds of Boxer Indemnity funds for the Guang-Shao renovation costs. Xiang-E has already borrowed 110,000 pounds, and Guang-Shao has borrowed more than 30,000 pounds. Xiang-E needs 240,000 pounds, and Guang-Yun needs 70,000 pounds, all of which are planned to be allocated from the aforementioned accumulated Boxer Indemnity funds. The Ministry's share of the unborrowed accumulated London Boxer Indemnity funds is more than 929,000 pounds. According to the above calculations, after allocating 240,000 pounds for Xiang-E and 70,000 pounds for Guang-Shao, there should still be a balance of 619,217 pounds. The Jiao-Ji material purchase advance of 35 pounds and the capital ferry loan of 200,000 pounds should all be repaid before the 26th year in accordance with the contract provisions, which is appropriate before the Shao-Le section is opened to traffic. Therefore, the 520,000 pounds of insufficient funds for Yue could not be obtained. The uncompleted project cost of the Shao-Le section of the Zhuzhou and Shao section, which accounts for 1.5 million yuan in construction and material expenses, as well as debt repayment, is intended to be paid for this purpose. It is not included in this loan of 70 million, so the construction fund will now be only 800,000 yuan, and it is proposed that the Guang Shao Railway Bureau will provide assistance to provide the cost of the Shao Le segment's construction. If not, an additional 523,363 would not be obtained. In order to have the traffic as soon as possible, there needs to be 800,000 yuan. To solve this, it has been proposed to have a payment system. If the accumlated costs of the London Fund were not used, they could be made available by other returning loans. The plan is to have the funds back no later than December 26 and be paid with cash.

<h3 id="e61">Shanghai Merchants Bureau's Plan to Develop Northern Shipping Routes <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>▲ Setting Up a Branch in Qingdao</p>
<p>Qingdao Communication: The Shanghai Merchants Bureau, in order to expand its business, has established a branch in Qingdao and appointed Sun Zhenwu as the director. He arrived in Qingdao a few days ago to prepare for everything. According to Zhang Zhongguang, an employee of the bureau, the Shanghai headquarters considered Qingdao an important trading port in northern China, making it necessary to establish a branch. Therefore, Director Sun was specifically assigned to Qingdao to take charge of the establishment. The headquarters originally had nine river steamers and twenty-six ocean-going vessels (excluding those currently being built). All shipping routes are divided into the Nanyang (Southeast Asia) route, the Beiyang (Northern China) route, the Yangtze River route (also known as the Shanghai-Hankou route), the Hankou-Yichang route, the Sichuan-Hankou route, and the Hankou-Changsha route. The Nanyang route has six branches in Fuzhou, Xiamen, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, and Shantou. The Beiyang route has four branches in Yingkou, Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao. The Yangtze River route has fifteen wharves along the way and eight branches in Tongzhou, Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, and Hankou. After the official establishment of the Qingdao branch, it is planned to add two shipping routes: one from Qingdao to Shanghai, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, with three ships designated for this route: "Gongping" and "Meili" (both around 3,000 tons), and "Wu Yang" (about 5,000 tons). If shipping demand increases in the future and ships are insufficient, "Haiyang" and "Hairui" will be added to this route. The other route will run between Qingdao, Tianjin, Yingkou, and Dalian, with three ships temporarily designated for this route: "Xin Ming," "Xin Feng," and "Anning," specifically for transporting local products and goods. The internal organization of the Qingdao branch will be divided into four sections: business, general affairs, accounting, and documentation. Once the branch location is secured, it will move in for formal operation and commence shipping services. (October 26)</p>
<h3 id="e62">The Land Tax Assessment Turmoil in Jiangdu Has Not Subsided <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yangzhou Communication: The land tax assessment turmoil in the second district of this county has spread to the tenth district. Not only has the aftermath not subsided, but it also shows signs of expanding. In the tenth district, gentry and wealthy households whose houses were set on fire by villagers include those of District Head Lu Guangjian, Town Heads Xiao Jie and Xiao Zhenyang, as well as Si Tu Miao's Shi You'an and Tang Jinwan, Huang Jue Qiao's Wen Tongshun, Dou Yaozhai, Fang Yaoqing, Wang Xishou, Fangjiaxiang's Zhu Lianhe, Yijiaji's Wang Yongnian, Dou Sifang, Qilidian's Zhao Yongqing, Jijia Restaurant's Liu Hengyi, Yangjiamiao's Gao (surname), and others, totaling more than thirty households. All have reported to the county seat, which has forwarded the reports to the provincial government for instructions. A notice has been issued, roughly stating that the provincial government ordered a land survey and the Civil Affairs Department to reorganize the land, which overlapped. It has been resolved to have the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments review the matter. The county's previous request to approve temporary measures for the Finance Department to investigate land taxes should be suspended. All villagers should have no further concerns. It is also reported that groups of villagers are moving towards the ninth district. The county government has dispatched the fourth squad leader of the police force, Cheng Gongyu, and transferred forty-some police officers from the first and fourth squads to Xiangji Town to assess the situation. Coincidentally, Lin Zhaolong, the leader of the three propaganda teams sent by the county party headquarters to the Huaiqiao area to conduct propaganda, was tied up and beaten by villagers at Jijia Restaurant. Some team members escaped and reported to the independent regiment headquarters, public security bureau, and police team via telephone. Zhang Jifu, the supervisory committee member of the county party headquarters, led the police team to set off. Wang Yingzhang Zihe of the independent regiment also sent about a battalion, including a machine gun company, to continue their journey. En route, they encountered Committee Member Lin returning to the city in a small car. Upon inquiring, they learned that he had been rescued by the police team. Nearly ten thousand villagers were planning to surround the police team and were resisting. Committee Member Lin has been taken to the Tianye Hospital for treatment, and his injuries are not severe. It is reported that Liu Jinggao, whose house was burned down by villagers at Jijia Restaurant, saw two old men and one man in a Western suit among the crowd, using redwood sticks to direct the villagers and shouting to seize the police team's guns. Liu urgently used his self-defense pistol to kill one of the old men (another old man was stabbed four times by civilians). The police team captured the man in the Western suit and found a list and a police whistle on him. According to the man in the Western suit, his name is Luo Pijiang, and the deceased's surname is Chen. They have been escorted to the city for interrogation. Liu has also come to the city to identify the suspects. As for the detained villagers, after interrogation on the afternoon of the 26th by Li Mingyang, the director of the security bureau, and Han Deqin, a member of the provincial government, three people were released on the spot, and seven were released on bail. On the morning of the 27th, another seven were released on bail. Tang Qibin, Wang Xiaomazi, Zhu Qicai, and others are still in custody. On the evening of the 26th, Director Li and Committee Member Han convened a meeting at the River Works Bureau with the heads of the first, second, third, and fourth districts, as well as the heads and deputy heads of the respective towns, to discuss the matter. The district heads and others presented two points of view: (1) to request the issuance of a proclamation to temporarily suspend the land survey; (2) to request leniency in granting bail to the detained villagers. Li and Han stated that the first point was related to central government policy and could not be approved without authorization. The second point would be considered after investigation. On the afternoon of the 27th, Li and Han also invited representatives from various agencies and groups to discuss the matter. Committee Member Han reported on the causes of the turmoil, and Director Li reported on the differences between the situation in the morning and afternoon. Chang Shizhi, a representative of the Chamber of Commerce, and Ge Jianshi and Zhou Shaochang, members of the Provincial Party Headquarters, expressed their opinions successively. Finally, Li and Han announced that they had submitted a request to the provincial government to deal with the arrested villagers leniently. Currently, the gates of Yangzhou City, including the Guangchu Gate and the Northwest Gate, remain closed in the morning and partially open in the afternoon. (October 27)</p>
<p>Yangzhou Continued Report: Yesterday, after the police team went to the countryside and captured Luo Pijiang and others and brought them to the county, Provincial Government Member Han Deqin and Security Bureau Director Li Mingyang interrogated them that evening. According to their confessions, they revealed the names of their accomplices and masterminds. The police team, detective team, and public security detective team were immediately ordered to go to the countryside overnight to search and arrest them at their addresses. From then until this morning (28th), Ge Guangxing (also known as Ge Dayan), Liu Jinju, Yang (surname), Jiang Tingbao, Jiang Tingyan, Jiang Tingkun, Chen Youshan, Chen Yongsheng, Chen Yongcai, and Bu Dengchang, Liu Yushan, and others who were captured with the help of the public, totaling more than ten people, were escorted to the city. County Magistrate Yang, together with the two provincial committee members Han and Li, conducted a detailed investigation from 8:00 AM until evening. The security was tight, and details were unknown, but it was heard that the suspects were heavily implicated. This morning, villagers were still gathering at Jijia Restaurant, with even more people than yesterday. Around 10:00 AM, they attempted to riot and set fire to houses again. The third battalion of the independent regiment, which had been sent to suppress the riot, fired a volley into the air, and the crowd dispersed. They then gathered again at Yangjiamiao and Qilidian. Upon receiving the news, the city sent battalion commander Shen of the independent regiment with two companies of soldiers to suppress the riot. It was reported that around 4:00 PM, more than ten thousand villagers gathered at Tan and other places behind Nongweitian and advanced towards the Jijia Restaurant area. Upon receiving the news, military and police units dispatched teams to various locations to strictly defend and search for the ringleaders. The city's order is better today, but the soldiers and police guarding the city are paying close attention to pedestrians. The Public Security Bureau has also sent police to inspect hotels day and night, questioning anyone with suspicious behavior. The independent regiment has also sent teams to patrol the streets. Provincial Committee Members Han and Li believe that the seven detained villagers, including Zhu Qicai, are only slightly suspected due to the land tax assessment turmoil, and their circumstances are forgivable. Today, they ordered the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce to provide bail for their release. (October 28)</p>

<h3 id="e65">The Red Bandits in Western Anhui Have Been Suppressed <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Fourth Division is Concentrated in Bengbu Awaiting Orders</p>
<p>▲ All Sectors of Bengbu Welcome Xu Tingyao</p>
<p>Bengbu Communication: Xu Tingyao, the commander of the Fourth Division, was ordered to lead his troops from Bengbu in early June to suppress the Red Bandits in northern Anhui. After arriving at Zhengyangguan, he launched an offensive against the bandits. Before long, he successively recovered key areas such as Xindianpu, Huoqiu, Hekouji, and Yejiaji. Subsequently, he was ordered to advance towards western Anhui to suppress the remaining bandits, and he continued to occupy places such as Damaidian and Mapu. The Red Bandits on the Anhui border were then suppressed. The division then stationed in Jinjiazai, settled the refugees, searched for hidden bandits, and handled local rehabilitation. The Bandit Suppression Headquarters has now issued an order to the Fourth Division to return to Bengbu and concentrate to await orders, as the bandit atmosphere in the Henan-Anhui border area has been quelled. After receiving the order, Xu Tingyao ordered all units to return by train from their defense areas. He himself departed from Jinjiazai a few days ago. Yesterday (26th) afternoon, Xu, along with Independent Brigade Commander Guan Linzheng and several guards, arrived in Bengbu along the Huai River by small steamer. This morning (27th) around 2:00 AM, Public Security Bureau Director You Kaiyun and others led the security team, the water patrol team of the security bureau, and the citizens' self-defense corps to the riverbank wharf to welcome them. Xu arrived in Bengbu at 6:00 AM and was greeted by the troops. Xu then went to the Jiaotong Villa on Erma Road to rest. Representatives from all sectors and local figures visited in an endless stream. All stores in the city displayed banners to welcome him. According to Xu, the division's arrival in Bengbu is to concentrate and await orders. The defense area of Jinjiazai has been taken over by three regiments of Wang Jun's troops. On the same day, representatives from various agencies and groups held a welcome meeting at the Third Public Education Hall under Bengshan Mountain at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. Xu arrived at the meeting by car. Hundreds of people from all walks of life attended. Xu took the stage to give a speech, reporting in detail on the suppression of bandits in northern and western Anhui. He said that after setting out, it took three months to eliminate the Red Bandits on the Anhui border. There are now no bandits along the road from Huoqiu to Yejiaji and Jinjiazai, and pedestrians</p>
<p>can travel without worry. The Red Bandits in western Anhui have been completely suppressed. After the meeting, representatives from all sectors held a banquet for Xu and Guan Linzheng at the Dadong Villa at 6:00 PM in the afternoon. The host and guests toasted each other and were extremely cordial. Brigade Commander Guan reported on the Fourth Division's bandit suppression situation during the banquet. At 8:00 PM, the host and guests dispersed in high spirits. Xu took the Pingpu train to Beijing around 1:00 AM at night to meet with Chairman Chiang in Hankou and report on the bandit suppression situation. His troops have all departed from Jinjiazai and Yejiaji and will arrive in Bengbu successively in the coming days. (</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Anhui Audit Office Implements New Regulations <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲ Salt Stores Must Provide Guarantee to Obtain Licenses</p>
<p>Wuhu Communication: The Anhui Provincial Salt Affairs Audit Office recently suddenly changed its regulations, issuing a notice to all salt-selling stores in the province, requiring them to provide a guarantee and apply for a license before November 1st in order to sell salt. It also ordered them to fill out a four-column list with the daily sales and inventory of salt and report it to the office. Failure to comply will result in the suspension of salt distribution. As a result, salt merchants across the province have protested and repeatedly sent representatives to negotiate with the Salt Affairs Audit Office, requesting consideration of commercial interests and avoidance of disputes. The Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Salt Affairs Department, pleading on their behalf. At the same time, it sent a letter to the Salt Guild, asking them to inform all salt merchants to continue distributing salt as usual to maintain the people's food supply until further notice. Today, an emergency meeting was also convened at the County Chamber of Commerce. Everyone agreed that the new regulations issued by the Anhui Audit Office, requiring a guarantee and the creation of a list, have no precedent to follow. It is said that other provinces do not have such measures. How can Anhui be different? It was decided to send another telegram to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Audit Office to continue to operate under the old regulations</p>
<p>in order to reassure the business community. However, according to the Audit Office, the Transportation Bureau used to charge 1.5 yuan to 4 yuan for each license, but now it has been decided to charge nothing. Therefore, a guarantee is required to show restriction, and the tax police inspection of various sub-salt stores can be abolished to avoid disturbances. All counties in Anhui have already implemented this, except for Wuhu. As for the daily reporting of the four-column list, it is the implementation of scientific audit measures. Since the business community complains about the inconvenience, it has been decided to change it to monthly reporting. As for the concern that salt stores may oppose it, leading to a lack of salted food, that is not a problem. At the appropriate time, the Audit Office can immediately conduct public sales by region, and the people's food supply will not be affected. In view of this, the attitudes of both sides are firm and deadlocked. It is difficult to predict how it will be resolved. (October 28)</p>

<p>▲ Autumn Assessment of Fineness Generally Reduced by 0.1%. The County Government Previously Issued a Notice to All Agencies and District Heads, stating that the fineness of this year's autumn assessment should be discussed and decided as soon as possible to serve as a basis for reporting. A meeting was convened today, presided over by County Magistrate Shen. The situation of this year's autumn assessment was reported. After detailed discussion by the attendees, opinions were divided. After summarizing and voting, it was decided that the fineness of this year's autumn assessment would be generally reduced by 0.1%. ▲ Record of Court Hearing for the Bankruptcy Case of Songjiang Bank. The bankruptcy case of Songjiang Bank was heard again by the County Court yesterday. Zhang Zuo Liu and others, representatives of the plaintiffs, and lawyers Liu Zhimou and Qu Yue, appeared in court to state that the case has been delayed for more than</p>
<p>months and should be subject to provisional attachment to prevent difficulties in future enforcement. Subsequently, Sha Xunyi, the defendant's lawyer, argued that Zhang Shengshan, one of the defendants, is currently seriously ill, and the implementation of attachment would exacerbate his illness. Moreover, the defendant's lawyer Tang Mingshi was absent today, and the start of the debate should be postponed. The plaintiff Zhang Zuo Liu rebutted this. The court ruled that the debate hearing would be held on the 21st of next month and ordered everyone to withdraw. Zhang Shengshan, the ailing defendant, had already died last night (28th).</p>

<p>▲ Supporting the Northeast Volunteer Army. A discussion meeting was held by various people's groups in this county a few days ago, and it was decided to organize a donation team to support the Northeast Volunteer Army. The County Party Headquarters selected instructors for each team and printed propaganda materials, donation receipts, and flags for each team. All of these were completed yesterday and were immediately distributed to various people's groups and instructors to prepare for departure. At the same time, an order was issued to the party headquarters in each district, and a letter was sent to the county government to instruct the local government in each district to assist in the fundraising efforts.</p>
<p>▲ Uncle Stabbed and Injured by Nephew. Zhu Xiaodi, a farmer from Pengqimiao, recently prevented his nephew Zhu Laisheng from picking cotton</p>
<p>flowers in the field, resulting in an argument. Suddenly, Laisheng stabbed Xiaodi with a knife, inflicting six wounds, and blood flowed like a river. It was a tragic sight. Xiaodi's wife, Su (surname), filed a complaint with the county government to request an examination of the injuries and detention of the perpetrator. Laisheng was taken into custody. Yesterday (October 28th) afternoon, auditor Hu Cheng held a court hearing. Zhu Xiaodi was unable to move due to his serious injuries, and his wife, Su (surname), appeared on his behalf to describe the attack by her nephew Laisheng, requesting strict punishment. The defendant Zhu Laisheng was brought from prison. After the interrogation, the court ruled that the charge of harming a collateral relative was established and ordered a sentence to be announced at a later date, and the defendant was ordered to be returned to custody.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Wuxi <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲ Arrest of People from Haimen for Impersonating Officials and Inspecting Japanese Goods: Ni Shiyan and Shi Fanghua, recently purchased fifty-four and a half pieces of "chou huo" (goods from enemy countries) broadcloth and thirty-four bolts of remnant fabric from Yufu East Store in Shanghai. They loaded them onto a wheel-operated vessel to Wuxi. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 10 PM, they arrived in Wuxi and hired a small barge belonging to Sun Sanda at Tonghui Bridge, intending to transport the goods to Luoshe Town for sale. Unexpectedly, three men wearing Western suits, namely Lian Zhengming, Zhang Song, and Hua Jinfa, appeared. They carried forged official documents and insignia, claiming, "We are recorders from the Third Detachment of the Sixth Brigade of the Second District of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team. We are ordered to inspect Japanese goods and contraband." After speaking, they leaped onto the boat, intending to inspect the goods, and said that it would cost one hundred yuan in foreign currency to settle the matter. Ni and others realized that they were impersonating public officials, engaging in intimidation and fraud, and acting extremely unlawfully. They reported the matter to the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau for investigation. Upon receiving the report, Director Peng immediately dispatched Patrol Chief Chen and police officers to bring Lian and the others to the bureau. Bureaucrat Ji Yaping conducted an interrogation. Yesterday, a document was prepared and submitted to the General Bureau for review. Furthermore, Fang Jinsheng, a shareholder and manager of the Beitang Dahexing Company, as well as Yunhua Cloth Store, Beidajie Tongtaichang, Tang Ruicheng, Tianjin and other stores, have recently been privately importing large quantities of "chou huo", altering their appearance, expanding sales, and deceiving customers. This matter was discovered by the Blood Soul National Salvation Corps, who sent a letter of warning.</p>
<p>They were given three days to respond in the newspaper. If they continue to transport and sell these goods, the most severe measures will be taken against them.</p>
<p>▲ Dispute Between Officials and Merchants Over Slaughter Tax: Since Xu Jigong took over the local slaughter tax, officials and merchants have been arguing over the tax amount, resulting in disputes for over a month without resolution. Director Xu believes that the Meat Industry Association is clinging to old habits, misunderstanding the law, obstructing rectification, and attempting to reduce the tax amount. The County Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of meat merchant leaders on the eleventh of this month to mediate and invited industry leaders again on the eighteenth to persuade them. Subsequently, the industry representatives replied that due to the current economic decline and sluggish business, they could not afford the previous tax amount. However, because it concerns special funds for education, they must reluctantly fulfill their obligations, but both tax collectors and merchants must be considered. They have acknowledged and paid half of the special construction tax and will be allowed to pay one-eighth of the special construction tax in installments thereafter. After reading the letter, Director Xu considered the language vague and empty. He noted that during the previous mediation by the Chamber of Commerce, a three-way agreement was reached for a daily payment of 69.3 yuan in regular and additional taxes. Now, the association's response to the Chamber of Commerce disregards the special funds, stubbornly adheres to its opinions, and delays the matter. Therefore, he has resubmitted the matter to the County Government, requesting that it forward the letter to the County Chamber of Commerce for review and action.</p>
<p>▲ Dispute over Sales Boundaries of Refined Salt: The Wuxi Jiuda Refined Salt Company has had repeated disputes with the Anti-Smuggling Merchant Patrol Team over the boundaries of its sales area, which have remained unresolved for a long time. The company complained that the Wuxi merchant patrol repeatedly seized official salt and imposed arbitrary fines. It submitted a petition to the Salt Affairs Administration, requesting that it order the return of the original salt, compensate for the losses, protect the rights of the people, and emphasize taxation. A reply was received stating that according to the investigation by the Songjiang Transportation Deputy, the refined salt seized by the merchant patrol was outside the boundary. It was requested that the salt be returned to the original sales location in accordance with the general rules for refined salt, as required by the order. At the same time, the Salt Transportation Deputy Commissioner's Office received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, stating that regarding the dispute over the sales boundaries of Jiuda Refined Salt in Wuxi, instructions were received from the Executive Yuan stating, "Although Wuxi's commercial port does not have a clearly defined boundary, the county has stated that, based on past commercial conditions, the prosperous roads from Jingyun in the east to Kaiyuan in the west within the county seat can be considered as natural boundaries of the commercial port. Following the precedent of Nanjing's sales of refined salt, where the scope was based on the former Pingzheng Yuan's ruling, with Xiaguan as the boundary, the area should be designated as the sales area for refined salt in Wuxi. Both parties should be ordered to comply to show restriction and prevent disputes." The Transportation Deputy Commissioner's Office has ordered the Jiuda Company to comply. However, the Anti-Smuggling Merchant Patrol Team argues that the boundaries of the commercial port were clearly defined after a long period of discussion by the former Commercial Port Bureau and the former Wuxi City Board of Directors, and there are diagrams to prove it. There is no way to mix it with the newly constructed roads. They have submitted separate reports to the Ministry and the Executive Yuan to fight for their case.</p>
<p>▲ Joint Defense Office Issues Notice on Early Winter Defense: The joint defense of Wu, Kun, Qing, Jiang, Song, Jin, Wu, Xi, Yi, and Jiu counties decided at the previous meeting in Wuxi that, due to local unrest and the importance of defense, winter defense should be implemented earlier this year. It is stipulated that it will last for five months, from November 1st to the end of March next year, following the established practice. However, the waterways are particularly unstable this year, and a water patrol team should be organized, with red and green lights displayed at night. Green lights indicate peace, and red lights can be used in case of an accident to call for assistance from other teams. During the winter defense period, railway stations and ports should be strictly investigated to prevent petty thieves from mingling in and disrupting public order. If refugees arrive, passports should be suspended and original passports canceled and sent to the provincial government for disposition and return to their original places of origin. The presence of communists within the territory should be closely guarded against to prevent accidents. The above items were notified by the Joint Defense Office to the County Government yesterday, ordering the land and water police to comply.</p>

<p>▲ Problem of the Chengxi Road Occupying Farmland: The Chengxi Road has been occupying farmland for three years since it was built and opened to traffic. The Construction Bureau has not yet surveyed the land. Village chiefs of Xinmin, Jiyi, Weishan and other villages have proposed to the First District Office that, since the land has been occupied, not only has the land price not been paid, but also taxes must still be paid, which is extremely unfair. The County Government should be ordered to expedite the survey and first exempt the land from taxes and give land prices to remove people's worries. The District Affairs Meeting yesterday (the 27th) decided that District Chief Liu should submit the issue to the District Chief Meeting for discussion.</p>
<p>▲ Arson Fugitive Apprehended in Suzhou: After the arson case involving Chen Zhangba and Wang Xiaoda in the Second District was solved, the case of assaulting the police and the robbery case at Chen Minghe's house in Liuwei were also solved one after another with the capture of key criminals. Because accomplice Fei Quanyuan was hiding in a distiller's shop in Loumen, Suzhou, Detective Team Leader Huang went to Suzhou to arrest him and brought him back to Cheng on the 27th. He confessed to being a lookout during the arson at Wang Xiaoda's house and was immediately taken into custody.</p>

<p>▲ Party Headquarters Requests Strict Handling of Corruption Case in the Court: The Supervisory Committee of the Wuyi County Party Headquarters believes that since the establishment of the County Court, the handling of cases has been unsatisfactory in many ways. Even Lei Renlong, as the President of the Court, has committed three crimes of dereliction of duty, fraud, and embezzlement. Recently, a clerk named Ni Yuzhang dared to openly bribe Judge Hu Jingqing with regard to the serious offender Wang Zeng'ai Zhu, who was charged with poison. Both cases have been separately judged and investigated. Yesterday (the 27th), a special report was submitted to the Provincial Party Headquarters and forwarded to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, ordering the Higher Court to thoroughly rectify and strictly handle the matter according to the law.</p>
<p>Abduction of Village Chief Solved in Shanghai: The village chief of Jinnu Village in the Fourth District of Wuyi and the young son of Zong Xigen were kidnapped by bandits Zhang Hongsheng and Chen Ergen. Several suspects, including Zhang Rongzhao, were subsequently apprehended. Recently, Ni Gusheng, the captain of the county detective team, learned that Zhang Hongsheng and others were hiding in Shanghai. He immediately led his team to Shanghai overnight and arrested Zhang and Chen on the spot in a Yidao Jiao teahouse. They were sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for detention. Meanwhile, the county government prepared a document and went to Shanghai on the 29th to retrieve them for trial.</p>
<p>▲ Verdict on Riot Case by the High Court: Jin Xiangsheng and others, who were involved in the November 18 riot in Wuyi last year, appealed to the High Court after being sentenced by the County Court.

<p>▲ County Defense Committee Expands Publicity: The Jiangsu Provincial Defense Committee and the Department of Civil Affairs instructed all counties to conduct expanded defense publicity campaigns to raise public awareness. It is reported that upon receiving the order, the County Defense Committee scheduled the period from the 24th to the 29th of this month as the expanded publicity period. It requested various agencies and organizations to cooperate in accordance with the provincial publicity guidelines. County Chief and General Commander Tan Yigui, together with Public Security Bureau Chief Yin Peng, Education Bureau Chief Yu Cheng, Head of Corps Affairs Wang Kunshan, and other committee members, carried a large number of publicity materials and went to various districts for practical publicity. In advance, they telegraphed the district chiefs and district corps chiefs of each district to convene the chiefs of each jia (unit of ten households) to gather at the district office and await dispatch. On the appointed day, the general commander and others first explained the main points of the publicity to the jia chiefs in detail, and then the jia chiefs went to various townships and towns for publicity in order to achieve universal coverage.</p>

<p>▲ Request for Exemption from Business Tax for Poor People's Workshop: The Jiangyan Town Business Office of the First Poor People's Workshop in the county was ordered by the Business Tax Bureau to declare its business volume. The manager of the workshop sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting it to apply to the higher authorities in accordance with the regulations for the exemption of poor people's workshops in various places established by the Legislative Yuan.

<p>▲ Shareholders of Egg Company Arrested for Defrauding Funds: The Dingda Egg Company outside the North Gate of the city was established by Zhu Yaoqing, Yang Daoqiu, and Luo Haiquan with joint investment. Zhu was from Huaian City and had been in the egg business for a long time. He served as a comprador in the You Post Branch of the Peilin Company in Shanghai. However, Zhu was naturally frivolous and was not trusted by the head office, so the local branch in You was closed. This spring, Zhu joined forces with Luo and Yang and raised three thousand yuan to organize the Dingda Egg Company. The business was developing well. In order to develop the business, Zhu also added a branch in Huaiding and had dealings with money shops such as Yuanhe in the county to facilitate turnover. Unexpectedly, the previous time there was too much inventory in Shanghai and the price of eggs plummeted, resulting in a significant loss. Recently, Zhu and the others suddenly had a whimsical idea. Using the name of collecting eggs in Huai, they successively defrauded more than 18,000 yuan from money shops such as Yuanhe and Dingyuanchun. The three of them divided the money. Yang returned to You the day before yesterday and temporarily hid at home. Zhu and Luo also planned to escape by boat. However, the money shops detected this and reported it to the police. The police arrested Zhu and Luo and sent them to the Huaian County Government for interrogation. They also confessed that Yang Daoqiu, who was on the run, was hiding in Gaoyou. The Huaian County Government ordered the police to come to You by car overnight and arrest Yang. They were escorted back to Huaian yesterday (the 26th) for interrogation.</p>

<p>▲ Bandits Li Zheng and Lü Xirong Executed by Firing Squad: After the capture of bandit leaders Li Zheng and Lü Xirong in the major kidnapping case in the Northeast Township, they were repeatedly interrogated. Due to their repeated offenses of kidnapping for ransom and conclusive evidence, the County Government sent a telegram to the Provincial Government for review and approval. After receiving the provincial telegram, the two bandits were executed by firing squad according to law. The criminals were then taken to the execution ground after their identities were verified.</p>

<p>▲ Corruption Case in District Office Relief Distribution: In the Seventh District of Changxing County, when distributing relief rice, the clerks and secretaries of the district office secretly sold the rice. When the villagers became aware of this, they secretly reported it to County Chief Wang, who went to investigate and verify the matter. He took the clerk Shi to the county and the secretary Zhu fled in fear of punishment. District Chief Sun Hongdu was dismissed because he was unable to restrain them. Shi has been sent to the County Court for investigation and handling. Secretary Zhu is currently being pursued.</p>

<p>▲ Judicial Police Disrupt Theater: This county has never had a county-run fire brigade. Local merchants purchased water dragons and established a fire-fighting association, which has always been known for its enthusiasm in fire-fighting work. Recently, due to lack of funds, they negotiated with the Gongle Company to temporarily use the Xinmin Theater and hire actors from the Zhangji Stage for several days to raise funds. After several days of performances, the box office was not good and they lost about 300 yuan. On the fourth day, the weather was fine and the box office was very good. Unexpectedly, when collecting tickets, it was discovered that four law enforcement officers from the county government, Ge and Pu, were occupying first-class seats without buying tickets. When asked to explain, they slapped the ticket collector, Lin, several times and shouted to open fire, causing great disorder. The audience dispersed. The members of the fire-fighting association were furious, believing that the county government neither established a fire brigade nor condoned the lawless law enforcement officers who came to disrupt the event. The fire-fighting association could no longer be maintained, and they could only ask the county government to take on the fire-fighting duties. They telegraphed each fire station, ordering them to carry the water dragons to the county government. In an instant, the horns blew and each water dragon rushed to the county, causing great alarm among the citizens. Later, a patrol officer from the Public Security Bureau detained the law enforcement officers who caused the incident and telegraphed Tang Yuanbo, an official from the fire-fighting association, to persuade them. The turmoil subsided.</p>

<p>▲ Deadline for Rice Merchants to Settle Pledges: The banking and money industries in Hangzhou have accepted over 100,000 shi of rice pledged by rice merchants last year, with loans amounting to no less than 600,000 yuan. The deadline for settlement was generally set at the end of April this year. However, since the beginning of summer, rice prices have been declining, and the pledgers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude and ignored the matter. After autumn, rice prices became even cheaper, and the previous pledges became increasingly unmanageable. On the other hand, new grains are entering the market, and merchants need to borrow from banks or money shops to finance their operations. The banking and money industries refused to accept new pledges because the previous loans had not been settled and were in the process of being urged to be settled. After a month of stalemate, the matter could not be resolved. The City Chamber of Commerce decided to convene a meeting of leaders from the banking and money industries and rice merchants on the afternoon of the 28th to discuss a solution. Over twenty people attended, with Jin Runquan presiding. After repeated discussions, it was decided that the first step would be for the Chamber of Commerce to send letters to the Provincial Chamber of Commerce and then to the chambers of commerce in various counties and towns related to rice pledges, urging rice merchants and other pledgers to quickly come up with a plan to settle the rice pledges before November 15th of this year to maintain credit. It was also decided that the Chamber of Commerce would send letters to the banking and money industries associations, informing their members to continue accepting rice pledges as usual to benefit the people's food supply.</p>

<p>▲ At Yiyuan at 3 PM</p>
<p>The first port football match between Shanghai and Hong Kong is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on November 26. The Shanghai team has selected talents and divided them into two teams, Xu and Zhou Xianyan, for the first trial match, which will be held at Yiyuan at 3 PM today. The selected talents are all stars in Shanghai's football scene, making it the best opportunity to appreciate football skills.</p>
<p>The personnel of the two teams in this trial match are very balanced, making it difficult to judge who is the main team and who is the guest team. However, as many as eleven players from our Chinese football teams, Donghua and Jinan, have been selected for the trial match, which is an unprecedented achievement for Chinese people. Nine of them have been officially included in the lineup. Yesterday, the match between Jinan and the French Business School was postponed, so there was no "good ball" to watch. All the good ones are in the racecourse, which is not something that our people can enjoy. However, today's match will be even better and more wonderful, and will be a great feast for the eyes. ▲ Zhou Xianyan Team Al Le</p>

<p>Yesterday was the third day of the Shanghai Fourth Annual Elementary School Joint Sports Meet, which was also the last day of the sports meet, the award ceremony, and the closing ceremony. Most of the boys' track and field events were finals on this day, so the students of each participating school were extremely excited. The outside of the track was shoulder to shoulder, like an iron bucket, and the cheers were endless. The referees, seeing the black clouds gathering and the intention of rain, intensified their work and continued the competition, so all the events were completed in the morning. After lunch, the scores were calculated and prizes were distributed. The ceremony was completed at 4 PM. The results of the sports and the award ceremony are recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Yesterday's Western League Football Match: Youyou vs. Donghua Dramatic Battle <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>▲Unfortunately, a Crushing Defeat of 1-3</p>
<p>▲First Half Dramatic Battle with No Result</p>
<p>The Donghua and Youyou football teams played yesterday in the rain at the Chinese Baseball Field. This was a scene from the Western League Football Group A league. Youyou knew it was no match, so it conserved all its strength to defend. In the first 45 minutes, Donghua could not find a way to break through, wasting its efforts and achieving nothing. Instead, Youyou almost ambushed Donghua, but fortunately, Zhou Xianyan saved it skillfully, preserving the territory. In the second half, Youyou's defender and main player, Zhu Qiu, was injured, and the formation suddenly became scattered, allowing Donghua to take the opportunity to score two goals successively by Tu Kaiyuan and Feng Yunyou. Later, Youyou's Shi Jinsheng also returned one goal. Donghua's Li Yichen also scored one goal. As a result, Donghua won 3-1. There were few spectators, and the performance was not very exciting.</p>
<p>▲Donghua Missed Two Shots After three o'clock, referee He Chunhui ordered the kickoff. Youyou's kickoff could not go deep and was fiercely pressed by Donghua. Youyou saw that the situation was not good, so the forwards were all transferred back to defense, not taking the offensive. Donghua's Chen Yutian and Chen Hongguang got the ball under Youyou's goal, with excellent opportunities, but unfortunately, they did not score.</p>
<p>▲The Iron Gate Unbroken, Fortunately Youyou only attacked with three people from the left and right wings and the center forward (the two inside forwards both defended), so there were few attacking opportunities. However, there were two dangerous shots that almost broke Donghua's iron gate, causing the audience to gasp. One was Zhu Shengfa's pass to the center, with Dong Xiaopei heading the ball towards the corner of the goal. Zhou Xianyan quickly saved it. The other was Sun Hupei's solo advance on the left wing, breaking through two lines of defense and sending the ball in front of Donghua's goal at the baseline. Dong Xiaopei rushed up, Zhou Xianyan received the ball and fell to the ground, but fortunately, he rolled away, averting the danger. These two shots greatly startled Donghua. Neither side scored in the first half.</p>
<p>▲Main Player Injured, Territory Falls Donghua was determined to win and tried every possible way to defeat the enemy from the start of the afternoon, but for the first 15 minutes, there was still no opportunity. Later, Youyou's defender Zhu Qiu was injured in the thigh and could not control the enemy, allowing Donghua's Tu Kaiyuan to score a goal in the chaos, opening the scoring. Afterwards, Feng Yunyou also scored a goal, and Youyou's territory was lost.</p>
<p>▲Shi Jinsheng Breaks the Iron Gate Youyou knew that defending was useless after losing two goals, so it launched an offensive, advancing on the right wing, forcing a corner kick. Zhu Shengfa made a wonderful pass, and Ben Ningyuan became a corner kick. Zhu Zaixi landed right in front of the goal, and Li Ning headed the ball to clear the danger, but unexpectedly, it was obtained by Youyou's midfielder Shi Jinsheng. Shi had an excellent opportunity at this point and shot at the goal, with the ball entering the corner of the goal. Zhou Xianyan fell to the ground but did not reach it, and the iron gate was broken. However, not long after this goal, Donghua's Li Yichen made a fierce shot, which was clear and beautiful, resulting in a score of 3-1. The lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>▲Donghua</p>
<p>Li Ning, Tu Kaiyuan, Wan Xianghua, Chen Hongguang</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Feng Yunyou, Li Yichen</p>
<p>Guan Xun'an, Wu Youliang, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Yutian</p>

<h3 id="e110">Little turbulence in finance and gold markets <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>▲Yesterday, the gold market had slight fluctuations, initially weakening and then strengthening. The high and low prices differed by six taels during the day, with twists and turns of more than two taels in the middle. In the end, it continued to fall by one tael. Dealers were optimistic, but the price fell immediately at the beginning of the morning, mainly due to the sharp decline in the silver market in the UK and the US, especially due to the sudden surge in silver futures and private telegrams on the Silver Exchange. As a result, the price broke through the 750 tael mark. Fortunately, the demand from various firms exceeded the supply, so the price gradually rose, and the exchange rate rose by half a point. The gold price hovered around 50 taels. Later, the British gold turned from strong to soft. Although some hedgers sold, the banks continued to buy. It was also reported that the Central Bank bought another 420 bars of spot gold, priced at 52 taels. It is said that Yuanxingyong and Dadecheng offered the price, which boosted confidence and made the price more attractive. As a result, the price stood between 53 taels. One hundred and forty bars for November were dropped by Ruixing, and the long positions of Duofang, Tongfeng, and Heng were short three taels. Because the market is closed on Saturday and to check the market conditions this week from the quiet to a lively atmosphere, waves are surging. At the beginning of the week, it was weak due to the rise in silver prices. The minimum was 739 taels and two qian. Afterwards, the exchange rate plummeted, resulting in a situation where the exchange rate was strong in the UK and soft in the US. In addition, the gold market was surging with buyers, and gradually advancing. After that, it suddenly broke through the 760 tael mark, reaching 61 taels and two qian. Unexpectedly, international news was unfavorable to the gold market, so it fell sharply. By the end of the week, it had returned to within 50 taels. The difference throughout the week was 22 taels. Compared to last Saturday, it still rose by eight taels. However, the state of wavering is very difficult to predict. The market conditions yesterday are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Initial weakness, followed by recovery The opening price for December was 748 taels and three qian, a drop of five taels and five qian, which was actually affected by the sharp rise in the silver price of eight fen and five li and the private telegrams. The long-term price also rose by more than seven li, so the final price was 47 taels. Hengxing bought more than 100 bars, and Ganfeng, Yongru, Decheng, etc. followed, immediately pulling up two taels and eight qian, to 49 taels and eight qian. The exchange market initially appeared loose. The current exchange rate against doing 198125 is 10 pence in January. Then, HSBC absorbed US$875, but at 9:15, some retail investors sold, suppressing the price by a small amount. Then, US$0.0625 per month was available for sale, and Zhifeng, Yongzhaochang, Hengyu, and Ruirenxing, acting for Qiao Ribu and others, came in, and then returned to 50 taels, totaling 51 taels. When HSBC quoted higher exchange rates for British and American currencies by 125, it immediately fell back to 49.5 taels. Chang, Dadecheng, Futaiheng, etc. bought, and HSBC absorbed 75 British gold in November, adding two taels, to 51 taels and five qian at 10:00. At that time, it was reduced by another two taels, as Hengyu, Yuantai, Yuanmao, Yongru, etc. sold. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of several qian. After 10:30, the Central Bank absorbed 75 US dollars in November, and Fuchang, Dadecheng, Senchangyong, etc. bought, jumping more than two taels, to 52 taels and five qian at 10:50. Hengxing suddenly sold, immediately plummeting more than one tael, to 50 taels and seven qian at 11:00. Later, Yuanxingyong entered the market to buy, and it was rumored in the market that the Central Bank opened a cash position, which boosted confidence and immediately rose two taels, to 52 taels and nine qian at 11:30. At this time, there were also many sellers, instantly decreasing one tael and five qian, to 51 taels and four qian. After 11:40, banks absorbed 875 US dollars in December, 9375 in January, and Zhaofeng, Changyifengyong, and goods for hedging came to mirror and drag in, causing the price to rise again by one tael, to 52 taels and nine qian at noon. When the market closed at 12:00, it was 52 taels and four qian, and it was done again to two taels, which was bought by Yuanmaoyong, etc. However, Ruixing released about 200 bars at this time, which had been entered in the morning (presumably Ribu’s notes), which was one tael lower than the previous day (according to the listing). The maximum for half a day was 52 taels and nine qian, and the minimum was 47 taels, with a review of five taels and nine qian. The red bar then fell, adding twenty taels and a half, because it was heard that Yang Qinghe Jiuji had stopped business and sold the stock to close the business.</p>
<p>▲Listed price less depressed two taels The listed price of the US dollar was higher by 125, so it was 814 taels, counting 64 taels. Later, 623 taels, and then 64 taels again. The result was 61 taels, less depressed by two taels than the previous day. Logged for November 54 taels, December 52 taels, and make up the water 55 taels.</p>
<p>▲A glimpse of the transaction There were more buyers on the table. According to statistics, Dadecheng, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Zhaofengchang, Yuanmaoyong, Futaiheng, and Yuanxingshui. Fuchang all entered. Ruixing initially entered and then exited, for a total of more than 600 bars (presumably Ribu’s notes). Shunli, Bingxing, and Fuyu retail investors all exited. US dollar hedgers entered. Hengyu, Yuantai, Daxingyong, Hongkangyong, Hengchangyong, etc. were busy with deposits and withdrawals. The Ningbo gang exited for more than 400 taels, entering a small number. The Cantonese gang, Hengxing and Yifeng, entered a total of more than 200 taels, and exited a total of more than 300 taels. The total number of bars for customer trading by each firm was more than 22,000, and there were still more than 3,000 for November that had not been settled.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Hunan Rice Continues to Rise — Fujian Merchants Vigorously Buying, Price Up Half a Dime — <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, imported rice sales to local customers were not brisk, with only slight inquiries. The market remained stable, but Hunan rice was very popular among the Fuzhou merchants. Their inventory had been exhausted, and new shipments were quickly purchased by them. Yesterday, 236 bags arrived, which were entirely bought by the Fuzhou merchants. Prices rose by half a dime compared to the previous opening. 100 bags of Hunan machine-oiled rice were priced at $9.20, and 136 bags of machine-milled Jing rice were priced at $8.95. 200 bags of Number One Saigon rice were sold locally for $9.00, it is said.</p>
<p>Flour and Wheat Plunge Wildly — Hit by the Exceptionally Cheap Imported Wheat —</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, the flour market, after the morning opening, showed signs of near-term stability but distant-term decline. Imported wheat prices varied slightly. The current month was supported by a major mill despite two price reductions. Therefore, although initially sluggish, it ultimately remained stable. Far-term months experienced a decline of over one dime due to unfavorable news about imported wheat. Bullish traders exited, and mills also offered their holdings. By the afternoon opening, except for the current month, which remained stubbornly firm, the other months saw an unprecedented plunge. The price of Australian current wheat was rumored to be as low as $3.50, and the Fu and Fu factories each had orders for one or two ships. Consequently, mills were eager to sell after pricing, with Fuxin alone reportedly selling 550,000 bags. Today's trading volume reached around 1.2 million, the highest since the market opened. The minimum market price for far-term one-two months fell to $1.73. This record is not only newly created but also rarely seen in over a decade. The overall trend is due to the pressure from surplus overseas, and there is little hope for future gains. As a result, the current month was better by 1.25 cents, November fell by 1.5 cents, December fell by 3.5 cents, January-February fell by 4.25 cents, and March fell by 3.25 cents.</p>
<p>▲ Yesterday, after the morning and afternoon openings, wheat futures largely showed a plunging trend. Imported wheat prices fluctuated little, but the overseas news was very gloomy. The eagerness to receive imported wheat increased, revealing an oversupply of agricultural products. If the local market does not follow the trend, future pressure will intensify. Therefore, the situation was unfavorable at the opening, and the afternoon was even more subdued. However, trading was minimal, and development was difficult. As a result, December fell by four cents compared to the previous day, and January, February, and March each fell by three cents. The delivery of current wheat was unaffected, wheat prices first fell then rebounded.</p>
<p>New Fungk Foreign Firm Reports: Chicago wheat on Friday (the 28th) first fell due to good Argentine harvest reports, then rose due to strong Canadian wheat. The total trading volume on the 27th was 20 million bushels. Overall, the future of wheat is still uncertain, but the selling pressure seems to have ended. A rebound within the day is expected. The market prices on the 28th are listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Prices Compared to Previous</p>
<p>December   45.50   unchanged</p>
<p>May   51.00   down 0.25</p>
<p>July   52.25   down 0.25</p>
<p>Silk and Tea Factories Experience Sluggish US Sales</p>
<p>The US raw silk market has recently been affected by the stock market decline and cheap Japanese silk sales, causing Chinese silk to become increasingly sluggish. Huangbai factories telegraphed complaining that prices were too high. B-grade 83-85 is degree 20-22. The Shanghai white factory telegraphed a price of only 523 taels, resulting in significant losses for the factory, and their attitude was negative, unwilling to sell. Yesterday, only Xinfu imported 20 bales of first-grade 13-15 degree Lu Huang factory silk at a price of 590 taels. Xiangli imported 20 bales of Globe brand second-grade Chongmian yellow coarse silk at a price of 270 taels.</p>
<p>Foreign Tea Market Slightly Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market was slightly quiet. Various firms only traded for half a day, concluding deals for over 500 boxes of Zhenmei, Zhenmei, Xiumei, and Zhucha bulk tea. Market prices remained largely unchanged. Russian and White Head merchants did not purchase Gongxi tea. However, Road and Local merchants Zhenmei tea reportedly sent out large telegraphs through Tongfu, Xiehe, and other firms, indicating promising development in the market next week.</p>
<p>Sugar Market White Slices See Price Increase</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little fluctuation in the gold standard Dutch exchange rate. The public association's pricing trend stabilized. Number 24 crude sugar white ex-warehouse bid remained at 15 taels, but sales were scarce. As today is Sunday, neither side relented, and no transactions occurred. Number 20 medium sugar discounted white was firm at 14 taels 4 qian, and Number 18 medium sugar white was firm at 14 taels 2 qian. Red sugar remained unchanged. Number 8 Dutch red was 11 taels 2 qian, unchanged. Number 90 Dutch red was 11 taels 5 qian to 11 taels 7 qian, slightly higher than the previous day. Chaozhou merchants opened a batch of white slices yesterday, totaling 50 bags, with a bright color, so the price opened at 10 taels, and the market looked good.</p>
<p>Sales of Min Bamboo Branches from Northern Jiangsu are Stagnant</p>
<p>Recently, very few Min bamboo branches have arrived. The previous arrivals still have some unopened batches because sales are exceptionally stagnant, and the arrivals are not pure. Therefore, the Jinshan branches have captured the market, and there is no hope for development. The current market price for higher-quality branches is no more than 20 taels, and there are few buyers. Only the Kuilan bamboo can still be sold, even with an increase of 8 or 9 taels, because both arrivals and inventory are scarce, but the quantity is limited.</p>

<p>Random Notes on the New Science of Augury by Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The science of augury, as told to me by history, could foretell the safety, danger, rise, and fall of nations, as well as the successes, failures, misfortunes, and blessings of individuals, based on the observation of atmospheric phenomena. What an amazing skill! Now, in modern times, we no longer hear of its successors. Could it be that the science of augury has been lost? Or was it originally a fabrication, with the ancients exaggerating in historical accounts?</p>
<p>In reality, there is now a new science of augury that everyone knows and understands. It is widespread, and simply opening the daily newspaper can serve as a tool to test this new science of augury.</p>
<p>Looking at the countries of Europe and America, one feels a sense of economic recession. The arrogance of one country affects the implementation of military reduction. The resentment of another country brews revenge. And the unwavering determination of a certain small South American country refuses to yield, all of which are manifestations of ominous signs. Even the United Kingdom and the United States, known for their wealth and power, have recently shown signs of economic recession. Look at the British Prince being ridiculed by unemployed and impoverished people during his travels. Look at the American President being subjected to all sorts of insults from the opposition during his speeches. What do these phenomena signify? Alas, it is self-evident!</p>
<p>An island nation embracing aggression appears outwardly to have the ambition to conquer the entirety of Manchuria. But wanting to "blow a breath to cook a cow's head," the problem has many aspects. As their own people say, swallowing Manchuria is like swallowing a bomb. When it explodes in the future, it may lead to their demise.</p>
<p>Looking back at our own country, the situation feels increasingly dire! All courage and heroic spirit have fled to the outside of the pass. Only the tearful and exhausted National Salvation Army and the volunteer forces are struggling and shouting there! Speaking of within the pass, the extravagance of important figures, the grievances of disaster victims, and the maliciousness of unscrupulous merchants have long created a chaotic and smoky atmosphere. To add to this, the troubles in Shandong have not ended, and the chaos in Sichuan has arisen again. They are very polite to foreign insults, but "attack each other with murderous intent" towards their own people. This is the bad luck of the people in the war zone! Alas, at this state of affairs, one's chest is truly bursting with anger.</p>
<p>Reading Wen Tianxiang's Song of Righteousness, many figures are described as having "righteousness that fills the mountains and rivers." Where have they all gone now? Righteous people cannot be found. The only thing that can be found is, as the people of Suzhou say: a crooked mouth blowing a trumpet, a bunch of evil energy.</p>
<p>Song of Winter Clothing! By Cheng Luding — Sung for all the gentlemen and ladies to hear —</p>
<p>Autumn has quietly departed, and winter has quietly arrived.</p>
<p>Red leaves and yellow flowers arranged the farewell feast of autumn; cold winds and severe frost prepared the fragrant carriage of winter.</p>
<p>The golden wind caresses the face, and the jade dew condenses into frost. This is precisely the time when autumn departs and winter arrives. Naturally, autumn has swept away a piece of my heart-stirring sorrow; indeed, winter has added a string of my heart-breaking tears!</p>
<p>Autumn departs and winter arrives. In this process, countless white hairs and rosy faces, one needle after another stringing together tear drops, one strand of sorrow after another, weave winter clothing, entrusting the migrating geese to bring to loved ones. However, in the broken mountains and rivers, there are also national heroes charging through blood and sleeping exposed with their spears as pillows. I cry, I grieve, but I truly do not wish to write anymore. On that line between life and death, what kind of world is it?</p>
<p>Ten thousand miles of desolate frontiers, thousands of lonely soldiers, the grass is exhausted, and the trees are gone; the rain weeps, and the wind howls; snowflakes and blood flowers fly wildly; the voices of ghosts and cries echo together. In this place, there is no warm and gentle place; there is no supply of fur coats and cotton clothing; there is only hot blood, only cold tears, only courage, only ambition to live through this bitter life of ice and snow.</p>
<p>If one has feelings, who would stand idly by? If one has reason, who would turn a blind eye? Unless one is a person with a mental disorder, who could bear to let them continue like this? Or, conversely, should one not make an effort to assist them?</p>
<p>The economy and food are certainly important, but the winter clothing they need now is also urgently needed. Conversely, their needs are our needs; their suffering is no different from our suffering!</p>
<p>Moreover, the survival or demise of a country must have its reasons for survival or demise, must have its possibilities for survival or demise, which depend on the will and actions of the people.</p>
<p>If China did not have them! Even if they existed, but without their will, without their actions, then China would have already perished. At most, it would only be a China that exists in name only.</p>
<p>The only thing that can allow China to seek survival from the brink of extinction is them, and only with them will it not perish.</p>
<p>This is not an exaggeration; this is not excessive praise; moreover, the ironclad facts are undeniable facts.</p>
<p>Gentlemen, ladies, having heard my Song of Winter Clothing, what should you do?</p>
<p>Not only what should you do! But also, you should come up with a solution.</p>
<p>Blue Sky, White Sun, Crimson Ground by Shen Yulin</p>
<p>During their schooling years, young people should exercise their bodies, concentrate on their studies, and build a solid foundation to become the masters of the future. Leaving school and serving the society and the people, one should not follow the crowd but should transform the adverse environment of society!</p>
<p>Never forget national humiliation every day until the day of avenging the humiliation arrives. Otherwise, living a life of pleasure and ignorance, the future of the country will be unimaginable!</p>
<p>Freely received, freely given away: this is the words and actions of Jesus Christ. If the world could see through everything, universal harmony could be achieved immediately!</p>
<p>Japanese imperialists are the common enemy of the Chinese people. If we do not have the ability to eliminate them, we simply have no days to live!</p>
<p>The Manchukuo puppet state! Any country that upholds justice will not recognize it because its organization is insidious and its background is vile! We should stand on the same battle line without delay to attack it!</p>
<p>The loss of territory is the ultimate shame and disgrace of a country! Actively recovering lost territory is the only path to survival for the Chinese nation!</p>
<p>Red blood, the blood must be hot. Taking advantage of the hot blood, go and annihilate the enemy! (Unpaid)</p>
<p>Modern Fable – A Felt Hat and Silk Stockings by Qian Xiao</p>
<p>When the modern young man was asleep. A felt hat on the coat rack laughed at a pair of silk stockings: "You are so lowly! You are only used to cover the feet and accompany leather shoes. As for me, I am high above, rubbing against the nicely combed hair. How pleasant!" The silk stockings had no words to answer his arrogant words.</p>
<p>A few days later, the young man felt that the felt hat on his head was no longer fashionable, so he sent it to the shoe store to be made into a pair of spats (worn over leather shoes when wearing a suit). At the same time, he cut off the leg of the silk stockings and made a delicate hairnet (modern young men often use discarded silk stockings to make hairnets) and put it on his head.</p>
<p>The hairnet looked down from his head and recognized that the felt spats on the young man's feet were the felt hat that had ridiculed him. So, he retaliated: "Felt hat, how come you are also covering the feet, and living a lowly life accompanying leather shoes?" The felt hat looked up and remembered that the hairnet was the silk stockings that he had mocked. He felt so ashamed that he could not find a place to hide.</p>
<p>News from the Art World</p>
<p>The Chinese National Road Construction Association is holding its 12th anniversary exhibition and entertainment gathering at the New World. It started on October 8th and will last for one month. During this month, in addition to the dozen or so entertainment performances regularly staged by the New World, various special programs are also being rehearsed at the Xinhua Theater. In the coming half month, there are still many well-known non-professional entertainment groups that need to participate. Movie stars Zhang Zhiyun, Yang Naimei, and others will also perform innovative programs. It is also reported that well-known playwrights Tang Huaiqiu, Ying Yunwei, Yuan Muzhi, Meng Junmou, and Yan Gefan are organizing comrades to rehearse famous plays.

It is said that the scenery and props are specially made. It is truly commendable to have such talent performing such famous plays.</p>
<p>Rotary Club Travelogue with the Postman into Guan (26) by Seeking Happiness Studio Owner</p>
<p>At this moment, the postmen broke free from the shackles of the Japanese and returned to being free citizens of the Republic of China. They saw the national flag that they had not seen for several days flying over the Shanhaiguan city gate! Each and every one of them was overjoyed and ecstatic, not knowing whether to laugh or cry! Lu Boqin firmly grasped Tong Yizhen's hand and loudly celebrated:</p>
<p>"We have safely entered Guan! From now on, there will only be eternal love, and there will be no obstacles or difficulties on our path of love!"</p>
<p>But at this moment, Tong Yizhen suddenly missed her homeland. In Lu Boqin's arms, she sweetly sobbed and said, "Although I have found a lover, I don't necessarily miss my hometown. However, the Northeast is still the territory of the Republic of China, and the people of the Northeast are still the people of the Republic of China! Thinking that the place is now forcibly occupied by the brutal Japanese, and the people are all prisoners, I don't know when it will be recovered? When will we be free? If there is no possibility of recovery for a long time, I will never have hope of returning home. How can I not cry bitterly?"</p>
<p>Lu Boqin fell silent again upon hearing this! After a long daze, he could not think of any words to comfort Yizhen. They arrived in Beiping feeling depressed and unhappy.</p>
<p>After getting off the train in Beiping, he took Yizhen directly to his cousin Lu Danian's house, explained everything, and Lu Danian readily agreed, allowing them to stay at his house and promising to complete their wedding ceremony on a selected date. Lu Boqin also received a notice from the post office that he had been reassigned to work at the Beiping General Post Office, so the problem of livelihood was not a concern.</p>
<p>One day, the Beiping Post Office held a special welcome party for their comrades from the Northeast. Lu Boqin was running around the venue when he suddenly heard an old colleague making behind-the-back sarcastic remarks about him in front of others:</p>
<p>"Only Little Lu is doing well. During the national crisis and when all of us are suffering, he even managed to seduce a beautiful wife." It turned out that now that they had reached a peaceful state, they could discuss right and wrong and settle old scores again!</p>
<p>But Lu Boqin seemed to have heard a loud thunderclap and was sweating profusely and feeling very uneasy. Before the meeting ended, he hurried home and told his cousin and Yizhen everything he had heard today. He then resolutely put forward a firm proposal:</p>
<p>"Who knew that I still avoid being unscrupulous! But I am definitely not a heartless person and should always find a way to correct it. From now on, I will go to the post office to work, and Yizhen will go to school wholeheartedly. The wedding will not be held for the time being. It must wait until the Northeast is recovered before it can be celebrated, so as to avoid others from criticizing me for only knowing personal love. Alas! How can there be a home before the Northeast is recovered! I should be the first to worry about the world and the last to enjoy it, striving to be an ordinary person with a responsibility for the rise and fall of the country!"</p>
<p>So, Lu Danian and Tong Yizhen both lowered their heads and remained silently facing each other. ?</p>
<p>The end of this novel is only that uncertain question mark in the small title on the right. When will the Northeast be recovered? When will this loving couple get married? Or will the Northeast never be recovered? Will they never get married? Or will there be other changes and transformations? Let's treat them all as long-standing problems for now. (The End)</p>

<p>Lin Sen Returns to Nanjing Tomorrow</p>
<p>▲ Reorganization of Fujian Province Nears Completion</p>
<p>▲ Chiang Kwang-nai to Serve as Chairman</p>
<p>According to the Kwok Man News Agency, after National Government Chairman Lin Sen returned to Shanghai from Fujian, reporters learned that Lin has decided to return to Nanjing tomorrow (31st) morning. Only Lin Chi-tang will accompany him. When reporters asked someone close to Lin about the reorganization of the Fujian provincial government, they were told that Chiang Kwang-nai and Tsai Ting-kai had previously met Lin in Shanghai to discuss the reorganization of the provincial government. Later, Chiang flew to Hankou to see Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek also said that the reorganization of Fujian Province was indeed necessary, but after the reorganization, Chiang Kwang-nai must preside over the position of chairman. At the time, Chiang (Kwang-nai) believed that unifying the Fujian army and breaking the separatist situation was his duty, but he felt that he was a soldier and not suited for politics, and he declined the position in person. As a result of the meeting, Chiang (Kwang-nai) only agreed to go to Fujian to take a look before making a decision. Now that Chen Kuo-yao has been resolved and the Fujian Communists in Longyan have been defeated, the reorganization of the Fujian provincial government is inevitable. After several telegraphic discussions, it has now become concrete. It is said that Chiang Kwang-nai has also agreed to serve as chairman. As for the provincial committee, Tsai Ting-kai, Sun Hsi-wen, and Fan Chi-wu have been internally determined. Once Chiang Kwang-nai sends another telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Hankou, the official announcement can be made. The above are all past and recent facts.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Rehabilitation Bonds</p>
<p>▲ Under Negotiation with Shanghai Banking Syndicate</p>
<p>▲ Secured by Wharf Dues</p>
<p>The Municipal Government has decided to issue six million yuan in rehabilitation bonds to rebuild the Zhabei war zone. This matter was stated to the China Eastern News Agency reporter by Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hung-chun yesterday. The matter is currently being discussed by Municipal Finance Bureau Director Tsai Tseng-chi and a certain banking syndicate. Once finalized, all bonds will be entrusted to the banking syndicate for safekeeping. Whether they will be circulated in the market will be decided by the banking syndicate itself. Currently, the Municipal Government plans to mortgage the bonds at 80% of their face value and stipulates that no kickbacks can be deducted to ensure that all proceeds are used for public purposes. The security for these bonds is the entire income from wharf dues, which will be repaid over 20 years. The Municipal Government can obtain at least 600,000 yuan annually from wharf dues, so the security is extremely secure. Furthermore, the regulations for these bonds have been submitted by the Municipal Government to the central government for approval and filing.</p>

<p>Italian Party Celebrates Tenth Anniversary</p>
<p>▲ Count Ciano and Count Bono both gave speeches</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, yesterday (28th) was the tenth anniversary of the Italian Fascist Party's March on Rome. Italian expatriates in the city went to the residence of Italian Minister Count Ciano at 555 Jing'an Temple Road to celebrate. Those affiliated with the Fascist Party all went in black shirts. The Italian Minister gave a speech, recounting the progress of Italy under Mussolini's leadership, especially the progress in adjusting labor-management relations. The so-called Labor Charter can be used as a model for other countries in the future. He then detailed the Fascist government's concern for overseas expatriates and the laws and regulations to protect the expatriates' spiritual and material interests, which were vastly different from the old government's neglect of the expatriates. Therefore, the trust in the Fascist Party by compatriots at home and abroad has rapidly increased. After the Italian Envoy finished speaking, the audience applauded thunderously, and all listeners were moved. They then sang the party song and dispersed. Before the Italian expatriates went to the Italian Envoy's residence to celebrate, Fascist Party members held a celebration meeting at the Italian Consul General's Office in the city, presided over by Acting Italian Consul General Count Nono. After a brief speech, party membership certificates were issued to female party members of the Shanghai branch. In the evening, a grand dance party was held at the Italian General Association. The Italian Minister and others attended the meeting, and the bright lights and wonderful dances created a temporary spectacle. It ended late at night.</p>

<p>Songjiang Girls' High School Student Self-Government Association Donates to Volunteer Army</p>
<p>▲ $280</p>
<p>The Provincial Songjiang Girls' High School Student Self-Government Association telegraphed: The Shanghai newspapers forward to all Northeast Volunteer Army comrades: We admire your concern for the tragedy of the fall of the three northeastern provinces, which has lasted for one year. Our compatriots are being massacred, which is extremely painful. At this critical moment of survival, those who hold the power of the state are at a loss and only know how to rely on the League of Nations. Those who wield military power stand by and do nothing and can only be brave in private fights. Thinking of this, who would not be heartbroken? Only our comrades are united in their hatred of the enemy and have risen up to kill the enemy. In the past month, victorious news has been reported repeatedly. The strong neighbors have been frightened, and the whole country is cheering. Your righteousness reaches the sky, and your loyalty shines like the sun and moon. The restoration of our land is within reach. We students are in the same boat and have a duty to do our part. We have donated $280 to be sent to the front lines to supply your needs. We know that this is a drop in the bucket and will not help much, but we would like to do our part. We hope that you will work hard to drive forward and eliminate the evil. We will bring glory to the nation and color to the land. The descendants of Yan and Huang are truly relying on you. We hereby express our condolences and hope you will consider it.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Foreign Exchange Rises Both Openly and Covertly <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>—Bank Absorption Capacity Still Good—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver market saw an unusual trend, with the pound falling and the U.S. dollar rising. Futures prices were particularly strong. In exchange rates, the pound was flat, and the U.S. dollar trended upward. In the local market, HSBC's listed price had already increased by half a notch, with both the British and American currencies at 1.125. Other banks followed suit. Only Hong Kong remained mired in a slump, suddenly falling by 0.25 to 76.75 taels. It is likely that banks internally, both in the morning and afternoon, maintained stability. As a result, compared to the previous day, both the British and American exchange rates rose by 0.0625. British gold prices saw few transactions. Banks made slight inward and outward adjustments. Approximately 400,000 to 500,000 U.S. dollars were largely sold off by Chinese gold firms and converted back into gold. Banks' absorption capacity was still good. The Central Bank also absorbed orders for November. Due to the market closure on Saturday, the previous trading prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲In the British exchange domestic market, there was a 1.25 difference during the half-day. The opening selling price for the near term was 1 shilling, 9 pence plus 8.8125, with the far term at 9.9375. The buying price was 8.875 to 10 pence. Banque Belge pour l'Étranger (華比) and British Bank (大英) traded for October at 8.8125. Chase National Bank (大通) and HSBC traded for November at 9.75. The afternoon closing selling price was 9.75 to 9.875, and the buying price was 8.8125 to 9.9375.</p>
<p>▲In the U.S. dollar domestic market, there was a 0.1875 fluctuation in the morning. The opening selling prices for October and November were the same at 29.875 yuan, December was 29.9375 yuan, and January was 30 yuan. The buying price was 0.125 higher. Banque Belge bought January at 1.125. HSBC bought October at 8.875. American Express Bank (美豐) bought January at 1.0625. Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company (麥行) and China Finance Corporation (中孚) bought at 30 yuan. Banque Belge sold at the same price, then bought February, and then sold March and the Central Bank bought November at 9.75 with HSBC. Banque Belge again bought December at 8.875. China Finance bought January at 9.9375. The afternoon closing price was 9.75 to 9.875, and the buying price was 0.125 higher, with a listed price of 1 yuan. The combined silver dollar rate was 3 taels, 3 mace, 8 fen, and 9.983 li.</p>

<p>Reuters reported from London on the 29th that Long Tiao returned to rise. At closing, the near-term price was 18 pence and 0.125, and the far-term price was 18 pence and 0.25, each rising by 0.1875 compared to the previous day. The British and American exchange rate opened at 3 yuan, 2 jiao, 8 fen, and 3.375.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Silver Dollar Market Typically Quiet on Weekends <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday. As usual, the market was quiet. However, foreign exchange transactions in the market were still considered lively, while sales to customers were sluggish. Various prices remained very close. Due to the banks' afternoon holiday, procedures were naturally simplified. Although money shops were open as usual, they were also relatively slow.</p>
<p>▲Yang Li Returns to Rise in Afternoon Market, Silver Discount Rate Unchanged. The "Yang Li" discount rate in the morning market remained the same as the previous afternoon, at 7 qian, 0 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, and a half. In the afternoon market, it suddenly rose by half a li, to 7 qian, 0 fen, 4 li, 2 hao, and a half. There was no hope of further progress in the situation. The "silver discount rate" was the same for both the morning and afternoon markets, at 4 fen. The additional water drawn remained unchanged, at 6 fen and 7 fen.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coins: Jiangsu Coins Surge, Copper Coins Shrink Slightly. Jiangsu small silver coins were the same in the morning and afternoon markets, at 6 qian, 1 fen, 7 li, a sharp increase of 5 li from the previous day. There were 9,000 jiao of transactions in the morning market and 2,500 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins were 5 qian, 9 fen, 4 li, 7 hao, and a half in the morning market, and 5 qian, 9 fen, 5 li, 3 hao, and seven-eighths in the afternoon market. There were 80,000 jiao of transactions in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins shrunk slightly by 500 wen, to 423,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Receipts and Deliveries Quiet, Transactions Sluggish. "Silver Funds": Yesterday's receipts and deliveries at the banks were simplified due to the weekend, and many receipts and deliveries could not be managed in the afternoon. Chinese merchants' receipt and delivery notes totaled 1.3 to 1.4 million, foreign merchants' receipt and delivery notes totaled over 1.2 million, and various freight, exchange tax, and miscellaneous funds totaled 5.89 million. Collateral transactions totaled over 700,000, warehouse receipts totaled 600,000 for entry and 400,000 for exit. Money shops and silver firms' single receipts and deliveries totaled over 2.7 million, receipt and delivery notes with additional water totaled over 3.2 million, and various out-of-town exchange notes totaled over 500,000. Cash receipts and deliveries were reconciled directly. "Foreign Funds": Exchange note transfers totaled 950,000 in the morning market and 755,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes totaled 75,000 in the morning market and 55,000 in the afternoon market. Off-market banknotes totaled 125,000 in the morning market and 50,000 in the afternoon market.

<h3 id="e115">Domestic Term Deposit Interest Rate Set <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>—Price at 5 Taels and 5 Mace—</p>
<p>The current term delivery situation is far less prosperous than in previous years. Term lending is even more indifferent, simply regarded as if nothing were happening. Only term deposit interest rates remain undiminished, as there is no other safe place for wealthy households to store their silver and money besides the deposit business. Therefore, the amount of term deposits remains unchanged from the past. As for the term deposit interest rate, it has always been determined by discussions among senior money industry members, observing market conditions, and the overall trend of supply and demand. This term could have been reduced due to a lack of demand, but it was still decided to be 5 taels and 5 mace, with little difference from the previous term (April)'s market price, in order to prevent unforeseen circumstances and maintain relationships with wealthy households.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Debt Consolidation Bonds Rebound, Up 1 Yuan and 3 Jiao <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>—Other Bonds Also Good, Up 6 to 7 Jiao, Market Conditions Prosperous—</p>
<p>—Debt Consolidation and Salt Tax Bonds for December Have Been Issued—</p>
<p>Yesterday (29th), spot transactions at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange remained scarce, but the futures market was more active than before delivery. Market sentiment was lively, as the prices of various bonds rebounded strongly, and the market was no longer as calm and lacking in vitality as before. Yesterday, the prices of various bond markets initially saw significant declines when many small investors sold to realize profits in the morning. However, due to strong buying interest afterwards, there was enthusiastic investment from all sides, and various prices rose sharply due to demand exceeding supply. The market softened slightly at the end of the trading day. As a result, the Debt Consolidation Bond for November rose by as much as 1 yuan and 3 jiao compared to the previous period, while others also rose by about 6 to 7 jiao. Spot prices for Salt Tax Bonds rose by 1 yuan and 8 jiao compared to Tuesday. It is said that the rise in bond prices is due to improved interest payments and principal repayments, while the current optimistic environmental situation and good public sentiment are the biggest reasons.</p>
<p>Total spot transactions for the day were only 9,000 yuan, with futures transactions totaling 3.55 million in the morning and over 2.8 million in the afternoon, for a total of 6.08 million yuan.</p>

<p>▲Spot Yarn and Cotton Market Conditions: The spot yarn and cotton market conditions are extremely calm. All groups lack vitality. Because American cotton has fallen again and the futures market is closed again, business has decreased even further. Sentiment is quite weak, and market conditions are extremely depressed. Due to the year-end delivery procedures, labeled yarn market is closed for one day. The actual market demand is only 106 bales. The market is flat and weak. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Xiamen 75, Shantou 10</p>
<p>Inland 20, Ningbo 1</p>
<p>▲Spot Cotton Market Conditions: Spot cotton market conditions are slightly weak due to the decline in American cotton and gold prices, and sentiment is relaxed. Spot cotton business is also sluggish. The source is estimated to be 1,566 bales of Yao cotton and 800 bales of Tong cotton. Sales are as follows:</p>
<p>Huo Ji Cotton 28.75, Shanghai Factory buys 700 bales of spot goods for delivery to the factory</p>
<p>Bei Xin Jing 29.5, Da Kang Factory buys 200 bales, also for delivery to the factory</p>
<p>American Cotton 34.35, San You Company buys 72 pieces, also for warehouse delivery</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Entire Process and Delivery Situation of Yarn and Cotton This Month <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲People's Labeled Yarn: The rise and fall of People's labeled yarn in October was extremely significant. It entered the market in mid-May, priced around 155 taels, reaching a high of 57 taels. Subsequently, due to the decline of rural areas domestically, financial depression, and sluggish actual demand, it fell below the 40-tael mark, to 138 taels. Then, Rong Xing Company (榮興號) took the opportunity to switch from short to long positions, and market sentiment gradually improved. At the same time, the Cantonese group in the southern port actively purchased, and in July and August, spot yarn sales reached approximately 100,000 bales. As a result, market inventory was scarce, and various factories opened large short positions in futures, making the market more stable. Unexpectedly, the US cotton government estimate was released on August 8, showing a decrease in production, jumping over 80 pounds, which greatly boosted sentiment, breaking through the 50-tael mark. However, US cotton continued to rise, and the upward trend was unstoppable. The highest spot price reached 9.2 cents. As for the short positions, they were quite uneasy and had to painfully close their positions. The highest price seen was over 158 taels. However, although the rise was strong, customer demand was not strong, which made the market less than perfect. The US cotton second estimate on September 8 showed a slight increase of 4,000 bales, and the market price plummeted by over 100 pounds. This greatly disappointed the buyers and fell below the 50-tael mark. The sellers' momentum grew stronger day by day, with heavy pressure. Yongan Company's (永安) long positions struggled desperately, but the environment was too bad, and conflicts occurred in Sichuan and Shandong provinces. The US cotton situation was also weak and depressed, and various groups did not purchase spot yarn. Some retail investors, seeing the poor surrounding atmosphere, closed their positions slightly. The lowest price seen in mid-October was 142 taels and 6 qian. The general market target was to see if the 40-tael mark could be maintained. It was said that the sellers had a large amount of goods to deliver, and Rong Xing's long positions were preparing to buy in the difficulties. Therefore, until the last day, the delivery was slightly short, and the scattered short positions covered their positions, and the market rose sharply. It rose by 3 taels and 1 qian in one day, with the last transaction at 146 taels. However, it was 5 taels lower than the price in the previous month. As a result, 11,600 bales remained, of which 6,750 bales were for self-delivery, and another 4,350 bales were for actual delivery. It is estimated that 2,550 bales of 20-count people's clock yarn, 700 bales of Songhe, 350 bales of Dragon Boat, 350 bales of Caihua, and 400 bales of Baoyi were delivered. The delivery price was 144 taels. Yongan Factory was the only buyer. The delivery side was also guaranteed by Bao's manufacturers and Shao. The agent's license numbers and quantities of the receiving and delivering parties are listed separately below:</p>

<p>▲Zheng Labeled Cotton: The rise and fall of Zheng labeled cotton in October was quite large. The struggle between the long and short sides was extremely fierce. The amount of delivery was also rare in recent years. Initially, it entered the market in mid-May at a price of 32 taels, rising to 3 taels and 2 qian. Later, due to the Shanghai war for two months, Japanese factories stopped production, consumption decreased, and economic difficulties occurred after the war, the price of US cotton found a new low, breaking through the 5-cent mark. At that time, people were extremely afraid. News of a disastrous fall was discovered in Tianjin's Xihe cotton. At the same time, in the production areas of Qi, Lu, Yan, and Yu, due to the stagnation of sales, there were reports of violent falls. In addition, yarn sales stopped, the market became more empty, and the market frequently fell, with a tendency to plummet. It broke through the 30-tael mark. In addition, the rumors of borrowing US cotton were extremely prevalent. Chinese factories once convened a meeting, so people became weaker and the market became more depressed. The lowest price once reached 27 taels and 9 qian. Unexpectedly, Yongan Factory took the opportunity to absorb a large amount. Before the US cotton rose from 5 cents to over 6 cents, the borrowing of US cotton disappeared, the market turned sharply upstream, and the upward trend became stronger day by day. The news of US cotton pests was serious, and the market became more stable. Unexpectedly, the US cotton government estimated on August 8 that production would decrease, rising by 85 pounds, so the rising momentum was even stronger. However, a manufacturer vigorously sold off, but the US cotton surge became more intense, with the highest spot price reaching 9.2 cents, and the Zheng Labeled cotton also reaching a high price of 34 taels, 4 qian, and 5 fen. The US cotton government estimated a second time on September 8 that production would increase by 4,000 bales, and the price plummeted by over 100 pounds. The initial strong momentum was completely dispersed, with a sharp drop of 1 tael and 5 qian. The Ningbo group also sold out, and the sellers took the opportunity to pursue, but the buyers never released the amount they bought. As for the sellers, they were also determined not to resist the advance. Most people looked at 30 taels to enter customs, so both the long and short sides had considerable strength. Later, in the last few days, 30 taels and 2 qian were seen, but the buyer's attitude remained strong. Although the seller had a large amount of goods to deliver, the buyer was also preparing to receive the goods, so the last transaction was 30 taels and 6 qian. As a result, 56,600 dan remained, the delivery price was 30 taels and 5 qian. Huo Ji cotton accounted for 14,500 dan, Shaanxi cotton accounted for 14,500 dan, Yao cotton accounted for 6,700 dan, and other Tianjin coarse velvet and Tongzhou cotton were actually delivered 45,900 dan. Self-delivery was 4,700 dan. Yongan received the most, and the Han brand also had some. A manufacturer delivered the goods independently.

<p>—European and Japanese Absorption—</p>
<p>A New York dispatch on the 28th reported on the cotton market last week: The southern hedging sales during the cotton market price decline last week were absorbed by domestic and foreign counterparts, and the quantity seemed to increase. The delivery price for December has reached 6 cents per pound. The intermediate spread has turned slightly scarce, and domestic supply has also decreased due to bad weather. Therefore, prices have increased slightly with counterpart purchases. However, public purchases are still limited by domestic political instability, the difficulty in predicting the next government's estimates, and good weather facilitating the movement of new cotton. Liverpool is still buying here to adjust the exchange rate differences of the pound, and Europe and Japan are also purchasing. Spot demand is sufficient to cause an increase in supply, so the basic price remains stable. The weekend statistics are attached below (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<p>Hong Ding, courtesy name Zhenjiu, a native of Shouxian County, Anhui, residing at No. 16 Yongqing Lane, Beile Road, French Concession, was 49 years old and worked in a certain party headquarters. His wife, Wu, was 33 years old. Because they had no daughters, they adopted their younger brother's daughter, Xiuying, as their adopted daughter. Last night, at around 10:00 PM, the girl felt hungry and asked her mother for six copper coins to go out and buy steamed buns to fill her stomach. Unexpectedly, after going out, she was lured to a certain place by criminals and forcibly raped. After the incident, the rapist fled. At around 11:00 PM, the girl still bought steamed buns and returned home. Her mother thought that the child was playing outside and did not expect an accident, so she did not ask her how long she had been out or what had happened. After the girl finished eating the steamed buns, the mother and daughter went to bed together. At this time, Hong was out attending a banquet with friends and had not returned. At 2:00 AM, Hong returned and knocked on the door. When the girl got up to open the door, Hong caught a glimpse of blood flowing from her legs. When asked, she did not understand why. He immediately ordered his wife to investigate. Wu discovered that the child's lower private parts were bleeding. Shocked, she sternly questioned her. The girl then told her mother what had happened, but there was no way to find the criminal. She was immediately sent to a small hospital on South Chengdu Road for treatment and returned home, but the bleeding did not stop. She was sent to the hospital again for treatment. The doctor replied that the hospital was not equipped and could not start treatment, and instructed her to send her to a large hospital. At this point, Hong and his wife sent the girl to Renji Hospital for treatment at 6:15 AM yesterday morning. After examination by the doctor, it was found that the internal blood vessels were ruptured due to injury. Surgery was performed immediately, but due to the severity of the injury, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 12:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The hospital reported to the French Concession Xiafei Police Station as usual and sent detectives to investigate. The body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for examination, awaiting a report to the Second Special Court for personnel to examine the body.</p>

<p>Case of Abduction and Trafficking of a Young Girl Involves a Foreigner.</p>
<p>A Foreigner Must Be Brought to Court for Further Interrogation.</p>
<p>The Sequence of Events Is Untrue and Incomplete.</p>
<p>Wu Zhu, a woman from Wuxi residing at No. 811, Baidang Road, French Concession, is 49 years old. She used to work as a servant for foreigners. She has a daughter named A Bao, who is 18 years old and already betrothed to someone. Suddenly, in April of this year, A Bao was abducted and went missing. After being found and brought back, she ran away again. It was not until now that it was discovered she had been abducted and hidden by Feng Abing, a Shaoxing native hired by the police. Wu Zhu hired lawyer Dong Qian to report the case to the French police, who dispatched Detective Shen Jinfu to first arrest Feng. Then, while arresting Wu A Bao, they happened to encounter her on Fuli Li Road and brought her to the police station together. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Second Special District Court for investigation. Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division, took his seat in the First Criminal Court to conduct the trial. First, Yuan Jiahan, the police lawyer, stated the case and filed charges according to Article 257 of the Criminal Law. Then, Detective Shen Jinfu reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendant. Next, the plaintiff, Wu Zhu, stated, "A Bao is my biological daughter, 18 years old this year, born on December 16th of the Republic of China's 4th year, zodiac Rabbit. She used to work in a cigarette factory and is already betrothed to someone, with the wedding set for October 18th. Unexpectedly, she was abducted in April, and it has now been discovered that she was abducted and hidden by the defendant. I reported the case to the police and requested an investigation." Lawyer Dong Yu, representing the plaintiff, requested to file a private prosecution and demanded that the defendant hand over the person, and so on. The judge ordered Feng to be taken down and first interrogated Wu A Bao. Wu stated, "Wu Zhu is my mother. I don't know if she is my biological mother. Zhou Shengyuan introduced me to Feng. First, he introduced me to a foreigner at No. 14 for 50 yuan a month, giving 30 yuan to my mother and 20 yuan to me. After two months, the foreigner didn't want me anymore. Then, Zhou introduced me to Feng Abing, and we lived together from May 2nd. It was agreed that Feng would give me 10 yuan a month. The first month's money was given to Zhou to be passed on to my mother, and the second month's money I gave to my mother myself. In August, I didn't have money to give to my mother because I was giving birth, so I left Feng. My mother knew everything that happened." Feng Abing confessed that he was 22 years old and Zhou Shengyuan introduced A Bao to live with him, and the rest of his statement was the same as Wu's. The judge then questioned Wu Zhu, who claimed that she did not know about her daughter's affairs outside and did not receive any money. The witness, Zhou Shengyuan, testified that he knew Wu Zhu and slightly knew Feng. "I did not introduce A Bao to the foreigner or to live with Feng. However, A Bao was betrothed to Gui Xinggen, and I was the matchmaker. Since I was the matchmaker for Gui, how could I introduce A Bao to someone else? I have been falsely accused and request an investigation." The judge then asked A Bao who she wished to live with. A Bao replied that living with Feng was not a long-term plan and she wished to go home with her mother and marry a proper husband. At this point, the judge ruled that the case involved a foreigner who had not been brought to court and adjourned the hearing to November 2nd for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody, and the detective in charge of the case was ordered to invite the foreigner to court for questioning next time. The defense lawyer for the defendant requested bail, but the court denied it.</p>

<p>Dr. Lu Shoushan Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</p>
<p>Lu Shoushan, a 64-year-old Cantonese man, resided in the kitchen of No. 491, Dexing Lane, Peng Road, and practiced medicine there. For unknown reasons, he committed suicide by swallowing opium the other day. His cohabitant, Li Jingming, discovered this and immediately reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, which ordered detectives to go to the scene and send him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He died soon after. The body was taken to the postmortem examination facility on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Guo Wei to the facility to examine the body. According to Li Jingming, who is 22 years old and cohabited with the deceased, around 7:00 PM the day before, a patient came to the doctor's office seeking treatment. However, the doctor was groaning in bed and refused to see the patient despite being called. Hearing the noise, Li went to check and found something amiss, so he reported it to the police, and so on. According to the deceased's son, Lu Binggan, who is 22 years old and works as a clerk in a leather shoe store at No. 186 Sichuan Road, the deceased was his father. He was at the store that day and did not know what happened. His father had a cough, and his medical career was not bad, so the reason for his suicide may have been due to illness. After receiving the testimony, Mr. Guo ruled that the deceased, Lu Shoushan, a male, died by poisoning himself before death. The body was handed over to his son, Lu Binggan, who signed a document to take it back for coffin and burial.</p>
<p>Female Corpse in West Shanghai Examined and Found to Have Died from Poisoning</p>
<p>Regarding the case of the bizarre discovery of a young woman's body in a pavilion room on the top floor of No. 13, Jinjia Lane, near Kangjia Bridge on Jisi Feier Road in West Shanghai, the details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. After the incident, the deceased's younger brother, Qin Shiwu, rushed to the scene. He claimed that his sister (i.e., the woman) was 23 years old this year, and her relationship with her husband had always been very good. They were inseparable. Recently, due to her husband's unemployment, their finances had become strained, leading to frequent arguments. His sister had a pretty face and a petite figure, and she usually dressed very meticulously. The local security chief of the 12th District, Shen Qi, reported the case to the local court the afternoon before. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Prosecutor Cao Changlin was dispatched by the court, along with the coroner, to the scene. The examination revealed that the female corpse's hair was disheveled, and her head was swollen to the size of a bucket. Her entire body was bloated, emitting a foul odor. Both legs were swollen like giant logs, and her back was black. Blood was flowing from her mouth, and her tongue was protruding from her lips. She was wearing a blue-striped cotton shirt, covered with a green and red-edged woolen vest, blue-striped cotton shorts, and was barefoot. There were no injuries. It was confirmed that she died from poisoning. The deceased's younger brother, Tai Shiwu, signed a document to prepare a coffin for burial. Inspector Li Yuanduo from the Public Security Bureau arrived at the scene to investigate. He noted that the bedding on the shop was neatly arranged, and there were several pieces of clothing hanging on the clothes rack. Torn pieces of the woman's photo were scattered on the floor. The cause of death was difficult to determine at the moment and would only be clear after her husband, Zhang Zhenyuan, was apprehended. It was also heard that the sub-landlord, Wang Abing, received an anonymous letter with the words "Public Health Bureau" on it, which was quite ridiculous.</p>

<p>First Special District Court Burns Confiscated Drugs</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Court regularly publicly burns confiscated opium, red pills, morphine, cocaine, heroin, and other types of drugs every three months to eliminate the poisonous atmosphere. The drugs confiscated in July, August, and September are now stored in the contraband warehouse in large quantities. After approval from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the court, led by President Zhou and Chief Prosecutor Wang, followed the established procedure and chose the Yizuka land of the Bao'an Hall on the south side of the court as the burning site. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, court clerks were ordered to move all the drugs that had been definitively judged in court from the warehouse to the Yizuka land. Under the supervision of the assigned prosecutor, the opium and red pills were thrown into the flames one by one, and a large amount of kerosene was poured on them to ensure they were completely reduced to ashes. During the burning, in addition to the meticulous work of the prosecutors, judicial police, and clerks dispatched by the court, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Law Society also sent representatives to the scene to observe.</p>

<p>Rental Reduction Issue in Baoyu Lane</p>
<p>▲ Landlord Agrees to Cancel the 5 Yuan Rent Increase</p>
<p>Tenants in Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street, French Concession, face a dire situation as their residences stand largely vacant, with nine out of ten units empty. Since the outbreak of war, they have been forced to pawn and borrow to pay their monthly rent, accumulating insurmountable debts. Many tenants are several months behind on their rent, and over ten households have been sued in court by the landlord, facing imminent ruin. Therefore, they earnestly requested the landlord, Dehe Foreign Firm, to consider their plight and reduce the rent by 20-30% to maintain the status quo. Upon receiving the letter, Dehe Foreign Firm immediately dispatched senior foreign staff the next day to conduct a door-to-door survey in Baoyu Lane, confirming the high vacancy rate. Subsequently, they sent representative Chen Guansheng to hold a negotiation meeting with tenant representatives at No. 30 Baoyu Lane on the afternoon of the day before. Tenant representatives included Yao Zhaoji, Yao Shouren, Zou Fengshan, Yao Wenqing, Tang Yinyuan, etc. As a result of the negotiations, the landlord representative firmly refused to reduce the rent. After tenant representative Mr. Yao and others explained the plight of the tenants, emphasizing that it would be difficult to sustain without a rent reduction, the landlord representative, Mr. Chen, only agreed to cancel the 5-yuan rent increase per building starting from November, but remained firm on not reducing the rent. The tenant representatives argued that with the current economic downturn, the existing rent was already a heavy burden, and a further increase would be unbearable. They believed that the benevolent landlord would not resort to such measures and implored Mr. Chen to convey their plea to the landlord, emphasizing that they were long-term tenants who were on the brink of bankruptcy due to the current difficulties and requested a rent reduction to maintain the status quo. Representative Chen still refused to accept, only agreeing to cancel the proposed 5-yuan rent increase. The tenant representatives, considering the interests of all tenants in the lane, agreed to convene a meeting of all tenants to seek public opinion and respond in writing. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Female Tea Room Attendant and Fish Stall Owner</p>
<p>▲ Initial Union Was Illicit</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Falling Out Leads to Legal Dispute</p>
<p>Tai Afeng, a charming tea attendant in her twenties at the Tianyun Teahouse in the Yong'an Company amusement park, is known for her attentive service to guests. Two years ago, Fei Ahua, a fish stall owner from Ningbo in the Hongkou market, visited the amusement park and met Afeng at the Tianyun Teahouse. Captivated by her beauty, he frequented the place and, over time, developed a close relationship with her. Despite being over forty, Fei, unaware of his age, believed he had won her favor and expressed his desire to take her as a concubine. Afeng initially pretended to agree, drawn by his wealth. Later, Fei moved her to No. 6, Baokang Lane, Zhejiang Road, due to the cramped living conditions at her previous address in Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road. Afeng seized the opportunity to acquire a large sum of money to furnish the new residence. However, once her desires were fulfilled, she turned against Fei, treating him like a stranger. Angered, Fei reported to the Hongkou Police Station the night before, claiming that 875 yuan in cash, usually kept in an iron box at his wife's residence, had disappeared. He suspected Afeng had stolen the money, as the box was placed behind the chamber pot, unknown to anyone except Afeng, who could have seen it while visiting their house. The police dispatched detectives Zhang Faxiang and Liu Decheng to arrest Afeng at the Tianyun Teahouse and search her home, where they found 200 yuan in cash and three receipts. One receipt was for a copper bed priced at 155 yuan, another for various furniture items priced at 105 yuan, and the third for clothing materials priced at 75 yuan. Yesterday morning, Qin Afeng was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Huang presided over the trial. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated that the case was being prosecuted under Article 337 of the Criminal Law for theft. Fei Ahua then described the theft, stating that the exact date was uncertain, but it was around the 10th of this month. The defendant had visited his house, and since his wife and he were at the Hongkou market, the defendant, being a friend of his wife, often came and went. When questioned, Qin Afeng denied the theft and recounted her relationship with Fei since they met. Finally, the plaintiff's lawyer, Fan Gang, and the defendant's lawyer debated, and Judge Huang ordered Qin Afeng to be detained pending sentencing.</p>
<p>Three Cases of Rape Sentenced</p>
<p>▲ Sentenced to Ten Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Tang A'er, on the 9th of this month, at 6:00 PM, lured Gu Rulin's eleven-year-old daughter, A'fu, from No. 18, Dexing Lane, Xixin Bridge Street, French Concession, and at 3:00 AM that night, forcibly raped her near a trash can in Baoxing Lane. The next afternoon, he attempted to sell her in the northern part of the city but was caught by the girl's relative, Zhou Buying, at the Baidu Bridge, who took Tang home and reported him to the police. He was escorted to the Second Special District Court, where Judge Xiong Huihua presided over the trial and appointed lawyer Zhu Dianqing to defend the defendant. After the debate was concluded, Judge Xiong sentenced Tang A'er yesterday morning in the First Criminal Court to ten years of imprisonment for the crime of rape, with fifteen years of deprivation of civil rights. After the sentencing, the defendant was returned to the detention center to await the appeal period before being sent to prison.</p>
<p>Spectacular Summerling Peck Dance and Music Concert</p>
<p>▲ Professor and Queen</p>
<p>The music and dance concert to be held at Summerling Peck on November 3rd is reportedly organized by Professor Hughes-Lin of the National Conservatory of Music. The content is said to be both visually and aurally stunning. Professor Hughes-Lin is a master of music and has long been renowned both domestically and internationally. Since arriving in Shanghai, he has been hired as a specialized professor of instruments and singing at the National Conservatory of Music. Outside of classes, he has also organized the "Art Goddess Troupe" to specialize in the study of music and dance. Its nature is similar to our country's national theater troupe. The troupe is full of talent, all of whom are music and dance experts in Shanghai, but they never easily show their talents. The music and dance concert to be held this time was commissioned by the Chinese People's Livelihood Self-Help Society, and because it is a charitable cause, they finally agreed. However, the professor takes his responsibility very seriously and has put a lot of thought into the selection of performers. On the one hand, it is necessary to show the splendor of the "Art Goddess Troupe," and on the other hand, it is necessary to cater to the audience's tastes. Many of the troupe members are from Germany, Italy, and Russia, and it is difficult to find a pure English singer. Fortunately, Bai Ersha, the Shanghai Russian Queen who left Shanghai more than two years ago, suddenly returned from her travels. The professor immediately approached her to discuss it, and Ms. Bai immediately agreed. Thus, the program was finalized. In addition to singing, there will also be Miss Yuan Ruoyu's modern dance and the crystal of art dance, Summerling Peck Dance, among other types, which are especially novel in Shanghai. The tickets for the two daytime shows have reportedly been nearly sold out, and the two shows at 7:00 PM and 9:00 PM at night will be on pre-sale at Summerling Peck on Tuesday. Those who buy tickets will surely be extremely enthusiastic.</p>

<p>China Publishing Monthly Published</p>
<p>In recent years, many new books have been published, but there is no detailed statistical method to introduce them. Scholars cannot buy the books they want to read, and publishers cannot widely promote them. The Hangzhou Private Zhejiang Circulation Library, in view of this, has specially published the "China Publishing Monthly," which collects new books published by bookstores across the country and compiles them into a book using scientific methods to introduce them to middle schools and above schools, libraries, and party and government agencies across the country, which is truly good news. The first issue of the publication has already been published. In addition to introducing new books published across the country, it also includes the sections "Education News," "Library News," and "Literature and Art." The article "Humble Proposals for Improving Chinese School Education" by Mr. Cheng Tianfang, Director of the Zhejiang Education Department, is an especially valuable treatise. It is heard that each issue of the publication sells for 1 jiao, and a subscription for all twelve issues of the year is 1 yuan. The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union Library, No. 230 Laobazi Road, also sells the publication on consignment.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Preliminary Hearing of Notorious Robber Ding Fubao and Others <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲ Mrs. Ding Liu Pays 3,000 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>▲ Lu Maoda and Six Others Released</p>
<p>Zhao Fuhai, a Chinese detective of the Xinzha Patrol Station, De Rong, and Bao Taiqian, a Western detective, successively arrested 18 men and women, including bandits Wang Zisheng and Wang Liutao, at No. 2 Tianxi Lane in Zhengjia Muqiao and the Zhongnan Hotel. They also seized four handguns and 29 bullets from the home of Ding Fubao at No. 3 Huacheng Lane on Min Ti Ni Yin Road. Subsequently, the First Special District Court, after releasing six people who were found to be unrelated, remanded the remaining 12 people in custody for further investigation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the date for the preliminary hearing arrived. The patrol station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, presented the circumstances of the investigation, stating that the patrol station's investigation procedures for the defendants Wang Liutao and Zhang Kunjin were not yet complete, so he requested another extension. Wang Yusheng and Wang Wenxiang are now being prosecuted for gang robbery, because they allegedly organized a gang armed with weapons on September 26 of this year to rob the Puyi Rice Shop at No. 646 Kunming Road of 163 silver dollars, and on October 8, they were involved in an attempted armed robbery of a tailor shop at No. 614 Fuchang Lane on Yunnan Road. Ding Fubao and his wife, Ding Liu, are being prosecuted for violating gun control laws because handguns and bullets were found in their residence. However, the place where the guns and bullets were stored was equipped with a mechanism under the floor inside the door, with no traces, making it difficult to detect. Therefore, if Ding Fubao had not provided the information, the patrol station might not have discovered them yet. The remaining six people, including Lu Maoda and Zhou Tang, are also unrelated to the cases and requested to be released. The defendants, Jiang Yiping, Fan Gang, Tao Wuzhi, and other lawyers, appeared in court to defend them. Then, Lin Xianglin, the owner of Puyi Rice Shop, and Wang Wu Li, a domestic servant from the Yunnan Road Tailor Shop, filed reports, proving the circumstances of the robbery. When questioned, the two defendants, Wang Zisheng and Wang Wenxiang, confessed that the two robberies were initiated by Xue Sheng and Monk, who are at large, who took them to commit the robberies. The handguns were held by Xue Sheng and others, and they did not enter the premises. Afterwards, Xue Sheng gave them each 50 yuan, and so on. When questioned, Ding Fubao confessed that the seized guns and bullets were deposited at his place by Wang Zisheng. Ding Liu claimed to know nothing about the guns and bullets. Her agent, lawyer Jiang Yiping, requested that she be allowed to post bail first. Judge Ge Shixun verified the confessions and ordered that the case be adjourned for seven days for further hearing. Ding Liu was allowed to post 3,000 yuan bail for release. Lu Maoda and others were allowed to be released. Wang Zisheng, Wang Wenxiang, Ding Fubao, Wang Liutao, and Zhang Kunjin were remanded in custody at the patrol station.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Thirteen Robbers Apprehended in the Donghai Hotel <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Lu Liankui, the Chinese Chief Inspector of the General Inspectorate of the General Patrol Station, learned that a large gang of kidnappers and bandits were hiding in the Donghai Hotel on Guangdong Road. He led Chinese detectives Liu Shaokui, Tang Jian, and others to the hotel secretly on the previous day. In Rooms 61, 64, and 68, they arrested 13 people, including Zhang Jiepu from Tongzhou, Gu Genlian, Zhang Amao, Tang Abao, Zhao Axiang, Song Mengsheng, Chen Heshang from Shanghai, Zhuang Ermu and Dai Xiaodi from Nanxiang, Yao Lianfu from Dachang, Lu Adong from Pudong, Wang Youtang from Changzhou, and Qiu Xiuying, a woman from Shanghai. They seized a handgun and five bullets and brought them back to the patrol station for separate detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District. Presiding Judge Feng Shide and Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuze ascended the bench for the hearing. The patrol station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that he was requesting that all defendants in the case be detained, because the patrol station was short on time and had not yet begun investigating the crimes they committed. Once the investigation is complete, he will formally prosecute them in court. Judge Feng verified the report and briefly questioned each suspect, then ordered them to be detained and adjourned the hearing for another day.</p>
