<p>自民元以來我國即長爲内戰（除有意義之革命戰爭外）所困頓在每一次混戰中將士之橫死於槍林彈雨之下者爲數誠莫計其凡幾然而此種戰爭僅爲供個人之驅策作個人之工具爲個人而犠牲毫無意義可言此次上海抗日之戰則不僅足以衛我民族亦即所以維護世界和平不僅足以壯我國魂亦即所以伸張公理正義不僅足以内儆國奸亦即所以外挫强暴使我民族精神爲之一振使國際人士之耳目爲之一新吾人若以此次戰爭與歷次内戰相較以此戰中之犠牲者與歷次内戰中之犠牲者相較其價値與意義實不可同日並論則斯墓之創建　其謂爲崇功報德母寗謂爲昭示來茲與其謂爲追懐忠烈母寗謂爲樹立典型他日斯墓告成凡勇於内戰但計個人利益而不惜殘民禍國之軍閥政客來此墓前者當無不撫衷自慚莫敢仰視以是益足昭示［無名英雄］之崇高偉大與夫斯墓創建之不容刻緩矣</p>
<p>又若歐戰而後參戰各國無不建有無名英雄墓以示尊崇國殤然而歐戰之實質實爲帝國主義者之混戰誰爲侵略誰爲自衛殊難判明而是非曲直亦不易辨故戰後無名英雄墓之建立在建立者雖視爲至足尊崇視爲赴仁就義之勇士但在吾人視之其意義亦不過徒爲軍國主義者作宣傳此次上海之抗日戰日爲侵略我爲自衛世所共見吾人訴之於國際而國際坐視待公理之裁判亦屬渺茫無期最後乃奮我必死之决心以自力謀自衛自救敵持良械我憑熱血月餘苦戰使强敵寒膽世界錯愕爭我民族之生命於垂危存公理正義於斷絕其悲壯其偉大實足以動天地而泣鬼神與日月爭光輝以是則益足以昭示無名英雄之豐功偉烈與夫斯墓創建之偉大意義</p>

<p>德國之軍縮將爲一般軍縮之先驅第三渠雖不忽視休戰後若干國内單獨裁軍之程度但有一事未稍變更者德國雖繼續在永遠限制下而他國則除華盛頓與倫敦海軍條約所涉及之非常重要區城域外尙未有限制軍備之相互的或約定的義務德國在條約上所不許用之戰具他國仍可用之第四德國乃國聯完全會具有在國聯中居於平等地位之無可爭的權利云西門又謂達到平等之最好方法應如下述㈠歐洲各國應共同莊嚴聲明在任何環境之下</p>
<p>不得用武力解决任何目前或未來之困難㈡德國軍備之限制應載入與限制他國軍備之同樣軍縮公約中㈢新規定之德國軍縮限制應與他國限制有同樣之時期及適用同樣之修正方法㈣關於軍備清單之問題如平等地位一經承認則質的軍縮之原則必須公認英政府願會同軍縮會其他各國將此原則載入新公約中云西門言及英國之天空軍縮提議謂第一在立即裁减各大國之空軍使與英國空軍相等第二</p>

<p>限定巡洋艦至大七千噸而裝六吋口徑之砲㈣英政府屢次主張</p>
<p>潛艇應全廢去蓋視此舉爲對軍縮會議與世界和平最大可能的貢戲之一並視此舉爲應付德國軍備平等要求關於此種戰具之最佳方法</p>

<p>第三修改訂正時期]敎育部以前中小學課程標準起草委員會、有變更必要、乃於二十年另行聘任專家、改組爲中小學課程及設備標準編訂委員會、從事彙集各方意見、研究修訂、計於六月十八日起開入會及各粗審查修訂委員會共二日將幼稚園和小學各科標凖大致决定、並將未完工作分别推員担在、到九月二十·廿一·又開大會及審查會兩日、將各項標準議决、交由常務委員整理、計畫盡力於這時期工作的、有左列諸委員、王晉鑫·江景雙·朱文叔·朱葆勤·吳研因·沈百英·沈雷濂·李清悚·李曉農·易克　·林端輔·胡叔異·胡顔立·施仁夫·俞子夷·馬客談·倪祝華·徐逸樵·翁之達·陳鶴琴·張國仁·彭百川·趙迺傳·趙廷爲·蔣息岑·鄭鶴聲·薛大漢·戴應觀·謝樹英·魏冰心·羅迪先·顧樹森·此外因各科標凖的研究問題、並經左列諸先生參加意見、（社會）趙鉦鐸·蔣子奇、（音樂）王允功·唐學詠·蕭友梅、、</p>

<p>㈠［黨義科］不特設、將黨義敎材充分融化於［國語］［社會］［自然］　各科中、㈡將暫行標凖［社會［［自然］兩科衛生部分劃出、另行訂定［衛生］科課程標、凖㈢改工作］科爲［勞作］科、並將商情部分删除、商情估價作業納入於［算衛］等科中㈣［社會］科中加入［公民］敎材［　修正其内容、㈤各科内容和文字上都有修正㈥另定[一總網］、、以爲各科標凖之冠、</p>

<p>在第三期修改訂正之後、本來就可頒行、不幸、部次長審核未完、血九一八事變、繼而這項標準、便也只好暫行擱置、今年朱部長到部後、覺得課程標準關係重要還須加以整理編訂、因此、又重行聘定委員、加以審核修改、計自八月一日至八月五日、共開大會五天、將此項標準編訂就緖、後來朱部長覺得小學國語課程標準、尤關重要又聘請文學專家、詳爲審核、計自九月廿六日起開會兩天、把小學國語課程標準再加一番黁琢工夫（　書敎材分量支配表、就是在這道次審核中擬定的）、小學公民訓練標準、八月開大會時、只有一個革案、整理後、分發各委員審查、到十月六日、乃集案整理後分發各委員審查到十月六日乃集合在京委員、開會討論、計開會兩天、這項標準、也就大致完成了、盡力於道時期的工作的爲下列諸君、</p>

<p>此次標凖、和上次不同的、</p>
<p>一增加公民訓練標凖就是小學訓育標凖因爲小學不特設公民各修身等關於道德訓綀科目所以增加這項標準以爲公民訓練的依據</p>

<p>中國長壽的人，近時狠少的。山東蓬萊縣有個姓阮的，現在東三省，他説已是一百四十八歲。又有一個姓李的也有一百多歲，各報上都刋過他的壽像。如今又來了一位壽翁張再豐，是皖北頴州人，年紀已有一百零九歲，他是前清道光甲申年生的。他有一件出衆驚人的異相，領下的鬚是根根見肉，長有三尺多，坐在椅上，鬚可拂地，較之漢朝的壽亭侯，又要長過一倍。據他自已説是吃了仙桃後，面貌改嫩，髭鬚暴長，細細詢他養生的秘訣，不外夫寡慾清心。他在紅羊劫時，遇着一位仙人，敎他錬丹採藥的方法，所以有此長壽。</p>
<p>他在小蓮花山修養，被共匪閙得不能再居，因此回到故鄉。親戚故舊均已死了，只好住在一家姓李的紳士家，此次經友人的介紹，特地到直海來，與一班善男信女，結個壽緣，不日將在大世界與諸君相覎哩。</p>

<p>— 承達</p>
<p>年來中外電影事業之發達，眞有一日千里之勢，不過要在大批出品中找到一張不談愛情的影片，竟不多見，這可知今日社會之需要的一斑。同時，我就連想到有好多青年意志的墮落，間接地受了這種愛情片的影響的，也一定不少。</p>
<p>青年們談愛，本是心理上必有的趨勢·也是應有的現象。然而他們的追求，往往是用不正當的手叚各盲目的認識，於是無端　地在社會上造就了種的慘劇，大有國家可不要，朋友可不要，而愛人不可不要的風氣。</p>
<p>在許多大學校裏·尤其是可以見到這些事實，今日初見，明日就可談愛的。</p>
<p>如果對方貌美的，舉止浪漫的，那更可產生不少的笑料，紅的綠的，説不盡許多。</p>
<p>前天我看了明星影片公司新片［可愛的仇敵，］給我一個很大的感觸。這片的情節是略述大學生徐源祿爲愛上一個浪漫女同學，竟和知友趙有成絶交，然趙有成不惜任何犧牲，規勸如故，［理智克服情感］終於把徐源祿醒悟過來。</p>
<p>這片一方面是指示出友誼是最貴的·一方面又爲眼前一般大學生糾正愛的觀念，在今日愛情影片充斥於市塲之下，突然發現這麽一張向一切無聊愛情片進攻的出品，不可不説是個良好的貢獻。</p>

<p>— 范烟橋</p>
<p>五也有一個愛字</p>
<p>下關江面，停泊的日艦，無端放了幾個空砲，都下頓呈恐怖的現象。最可晒的矛盾的事實·一部分住在下關的人，扶老携幼，倉皇地向城裡奔去；同時一部分住在城裡的人，也是箱籠舗蓋，累墜地奔出城來。韓慕良在××部，得到不好的消息最早，所以他走得最快，並且已下民决心，跳上火車，直還到蘇州的老家，方纔停了咘喘息。</p>
<p>他所引爲遺憾的，不是飯碗打碎，乃是花瓶遠離，他正在向一個女同志抒情，還未成熟，却給空砲　開了。</p>
<p>下關恐怖之風東流，上海緊張之潮西衝，會合在人間天堂的蘇州。蘇州人的瞻小，和陸稿薦醬肉一様馳名遠通的，况且這回的倭寇侵略，非甲子的内戰可比，太陽徽的飛機，天天來盤旋，慕良勉强在飛機遠去以後，喫了一碗粥，照例趟在沙發　發怔。無線電收音機不斷地報告··［匯山碼頭又到日本兵艦幾艘，滿裁着日本兵和軍官。］他的親戚朋友，陸續的來説··</p>
<p>［我們要走了。］慕良對夫人説··</p>
<p>［我們也走罷。］</p>
<p>韓大少奶自然不反走，但是走到那裡去？却是一個題。慕良以爲要走，非到上海不可，鄉鎭上有强盜，不如上海朋租界爲護符，所以終於［計家眷等，趁野鷄班輪船到上海，一面打一電報給他的乾爺，向××部請了長假。</p>
<p>上海的租界，雖也聽得一分鐘兩三　的砲聲，雖也瞧見閳北半天紅的炎光，雖也瞧餐卡車滿裝着目本兵在馬路上横衝直撞，到底有電網和沙袋隔成了别一世界，依舊有種種娛樂，種種食色的供給。他在甲子秋，住在租界上不管三七二十一，夜到大世界打詩謎，現在打詩謎，已不時髦了，頓覺得少了一個無聊消遺的頑意兒，偶然遇見了一個××部的同塌，談起這幾天的生活，那同志便領他到霓裳舞場去。</p>
<p>起初並不覺得有什麽興味，自從做了幾回拖車，漸漸的迷戀了，便夜夜去走一躺。他是無目的的，所以到了舞場裡隨便拉一個舞女，隨着靡靡的樂聲，在醉顏似的燈光裡，擁抱着舞一回　横登舞女除掉身體的長短，肥瘠，有不同以外，袒裼的酥胸貼伏着，膩滑的玉臂推挽着，圓渾的粉腿挺拒着，粉香來廠醉你，夢囈似的軟語來引逗你，惺忪的星眼來撩撥你，是個個具有的本能，急切分别不出一個高下來，總之陶醉了以後，面容還在其次呢。</p>

<p>▲輪貨損失三十餘萬</p>
<p>七埠福星公福慶輪船、在吳淞外　洞沙失炎沉没、已誌昨報、茲將此事詳情、續報如後、</p>
<p>▲途中損壞鍋爐福慶輪專航　　上海泉州間、本月十六日、由滬滿載貨物開赴泉州、於上午十一時許開出、至下午四時、行抵吳淞外裏洞沙海面、鍋爐忽然損壤、黨由老軌報告船主即奉船主之命、抛錨止航、修理鍋爐、自四時修至下午時四十分、尙末竣工、仍不能開駛、船中各職工、除有工作者外、餘各入艙安睡、七時五十分、該輪突然向右側倒、而且來勢甚快、三數分鐘、船身已橫倒在海面、艙面貨物、盡落海中、艙中物件、倒瀉一邊、床上員客、亦皆跌下、</p>
<p>▲黒夜呼救無應該輪橫倒後、海水狂衝進艙、機器間爐子、没入水内、全船熄火、旅客船員、在黑暗中捈扖出房艙、已不能步行、科頭洗足、扳登左彶舷甲板之欄桿、職工乘客、因忽促逃生、多有不及穿衣者、其時汽笛已不能拉響、黑夜懸旗、亦不能使人目覩、而船身下沉至速、全船人員、祇有高聲求救、是時雖見有輪經過、惜距　遠、呼救不應、</p>
<p>▲放火乞輪援救至九時半、　　眼見船身没沉、全部數十人、行將葬身魚腹、最後、經船員船主議定、祇得施放火箭求救、或可使他船得見、但火箭無從取處、遂將艙内所載之炎柴、設法搬出、就領江臺畔、用火焚燒、火柴引燃甚束、霎時間火光燭天、其時三發公司瑞康輪·合衆公司·鄭州輪、已由青島及海州來滬、瞥見海面大火、疑爲商船失愼、遂相率來救、</p>
<p>▲全船員客救出瑞康輪首先　　見火、由買辦小覺人、命開速車、開往裏洞沙、將近福慶、見船已倒沉、而船員水手旅客等、羣扳甲板欄桿上、下半身已没水中、事機急迫、瑞康立放大號舢板一艘、駛往救人、先後三次、共救起船主白西曼、（俄人）司機樂大根·老軌劉福權·二軌金·管事林六連、並水客小孩等、共四十餘人、而鄭州輪亦到、派舢板一艘、救起旅客海員等共十五人、被難員客、衣履盡濕、行李物件、均未取出、到船後、即經兩輪船員等、妥爲照料、代烘潮衣、至昨晨七時許、始載來上海、多於鴻興碼頭上陸、</p>

<p>▲青紗帳倒有地安身</p>
<p>▲砲火聲中絃歌不輟</p>
<p>▲利器不缺給養困難</p>
<p>中委潘雲超氏、日前曾赴中央、接洽義軍接濟問題、茲已事畢返滬、潘氏昨報告東北義軍之最近活動狀况、亟爲分誌如下、　　▲恐慌時期據潘氏談、義軍當夏秋之交、在東北之活動能力、其能使日軍略受痛創、疲于奔命者、全恃高梁茂密之青紗帳、沃野千里、一望無垠、義軍乃恃此天險、進可以攻、退可以守、數月來之豐功偉烈、當爲世人所共見、惟此際時届初冬、高梁悉已枯倒、向視爲唯一天險之青紗帳、邇已隨時令而俱去、故我人深憂天險一失、義軍即無處容足、將予義軍以充容進攻之機也、</p>
<p>▲平安過去不謂我人之所引爲深憂者、現竟出人意外、東北義軍當局、自知此項天險一失、無可容身、故早已利用該處之崇山峻嶺、作後退藏身之根據地、東北山岭嶺綿亘、樹木蔭翳、而形勢上險阻、尤爲日軍所深憚、此山嶺之中、幅員頗廣、不特能容數萬義軍、且村舍民居、亦極繁盛、義軍得此爲根據地、遂得固守其間、日軍來圍、則深藏而不出、日軍疏懈、則伺隙而進攻、即或日軍不避艱險、率隊鋭進、即能設計畫殲之、故日軍輒不敢深入、</p>
<p>絃歌不輟　在此被圍之深山中、義軍等之給養等等、當極困苦、惟因此種崇山峻嶺、居民繁夥之故、食糧一事、尚可敷衍、且人旣各懷必死之志、故無論義軍居民、男女老幼、尤能通力合作、蓋若輩知一旦義軍潰敗、日軍進駐、則淫威之下、必將玉石俱焚、惟日軍不時派遣飛機、前往轟炸、然終日樹木森森、目標難得、故破壞力絶徵、人民亦習爲故常、不以爲恐最近據報、遼南遼埬東之一衐深山之羲軍根據地、原有之中小學校、仍能照常授課、誦不輟、此又爲我人所夢想不到者也、</p>
<p>自造利器　　此外又有一事、更爲我人所夢想不到者、此輩軍、退藏深山日軍於此、雖未敢深入進、但不得不調集兵力、加圍困、其唯一目標、欲斷義軍之了彈等接濟、以减弱其作戰能力、詎邇接報告、康北義軍中、竟不乏傑出入才、能於無辦法中、思出辦法、而自造利器、所有火藥·子彈·手溜彈·步槍、甚至於大砲、均能自造故此輩深藏於山中被圍之義軍、槍械子彈、有此新發明之小兵工廠、竟能不感困難、故此事日軍當局、亦極驚訝、百思而又莫明其妙也、</p>
<p>日疲奔命　　雖然、東北義軍、固有不少部隊、被日軍包圍於深山　中、但大部份則因日軍兵力所不能及之處、仍能於氷天雪地　之中、作充分之流動性戰略、每乘風高月黑之際、作刦營之舉、其人數多則數千、少則二三人、或作佯攻、或以智取、每每深晚刦營、義　祇發一彈、而日軍聆此警報、正不知外間有多少人馬、即自相潰亂、濫放子彈、徒事虚靡彈藥、義軍於此、則早已他去、如斯行動、實足使日暈旣驚且懼、調兵遣將、益復疲於奔命、而軍則早又乘其兵力薄弱之處、予以進攻矣、</p>
<p>接濟困難　　義軍之作戰能力、由是判明、已不因青紗帳之毁棄、而減低其勢力、而日軍自云能於三個月内肅清之説、亦已逢自知有可靠、惟所最感困難者、厥爲章身乏術、迄今多數義軍、仍無禦寒之具、故海内同胞、亟應予以設法、俾義軍能度此卒歲、待至明春、當更可制日軍於死命也、此外復知義軍所在處、自來火業已絶跡、已恢復數十年前之覓炎舊法、而煤油等物、則又不得不以豆油花生油等替代矣、</p>
<p>統一指揮　　又義軍之作戰力、固足使日軍能疲於奔命、惟因缺乏統一指揮、故雖有大規模之計劃、輙復外能實現、故現下有人建議設立軍事委員會、負責指揮作戰、此外對義軍之給養財政及監察等、亦可由此機關、公平支配、使無畸輕畸重、則軍權旣可統一、給養亦可無开</p>
<p>憂、此後在東北作戰、更可較易力、又現　下日軍、並於東北義軍、已知無法對付、故往往收買地方知之民團、供其利用、此實大可痛心之事也、</p>

<p>— 萍林女士</p>
<p>兒童公肓問題，是目前女了解放，職業平等最先决問題，因爲若不注电　兒童公育間題，女子雖能出家庭，到社會服務，可是旣經生育的女子，不消説爲了子女的覊纏，當然要在家裏盡撫育子女的責任，不能棄兒童於不顧，或者説，［婦女職業的聲浪，一天高似一天，大人先生的夫人小姐，都迂尊降貴的到社會上服務，······各部有女部員，女科員，女法官，女縣長，女書記，商店銀行的女職員，遊戲塲飯食店的女招待，醫院的女看護，學校的女敎職員，工廠的女工，······這些都是佔去了男子的位置，········到那時家裏燒飯，洗衣，抱孩子正是男子的工作，要不然的話，再提倡男子職業也不遲，[誠然不錯，一點也不錯，但是我們祇知道説女子一到社會上服務，則數千年女子主中饋的事，便要交会於男子了，那麽豈不男子做女子的事，女子做男子的事，這樣地交換下去，恐怕將來的男子，又要象現在的女子要求提倡職業呢，事實上並不是如此的循環。</p>
<p>因爲社會是由人類組合而成的，女子旣是人類，且智力·體力·本與男子無大差别，爲麽要依賴男子而過着奴隸性的生活呢，所以女子應當到社會上來自食其力，達到男女平等的原則，男子有能力儘管在社會服務，用不着在家洗衣，燒飯，抱孩子，破除固有的家庭形式，各謀生計，（此指未生育的婦女而言）如已生育的婦女　，當然是不可能，處在這種情形之下，我們祇有提倡兒童公育，有敢兒童公育的地方，那麽一般在社會服務的婦女，就是不能在家撫育兒童，决不至使子女建全上發生影響！因爲要組織兒織兒童公育，當然是要有長於敎養兒童的專司其事，依分工原則敎養兒童·使兒童德育，智育·體育，可以平行發達，其成效必在舊式專賴交母爲生活之上，有了這種兒童公育的組織，女子可以達到其眞正的解放，雖然這是目前的理想，但是事實的趨努，終有實現的一日，人們不要再存着男優女劣的惡觀念，純粹以個朋爲單位，男女當平行發展，共同盡力於各種事業，男子更用不着畏懼位置被女子佔去，將有提倡男子職業的一日。</p>

<p>— 順基</p>
<p>·····小識之一······</p>
<p>海絨的性的性質時海絨一名海棉，是一種體骨的動物，他是生長在海底下的，根也是生長在石面上的··當時海絨活的時候，必有肉附在上面，好像一種軟糊··及到我們割掉離水以後，那末没有什麽内附在上面，不過有堅固有彈力有多微孔的骨架的體質罷了·</p>
<p>海絨的生活海絨中間的微孔多是海絨的口，水經過海絨許多微隙的時候，水裏的食物也隨之而送進到小孔裏面，而後小孔都收縮起來；拿水再送子出來，送水出來的時候，再經過海絨中的大的洞孔··水裏有滋養料的食物，他是保藏起來，假使没有滋養料的食物，那麽就和水一同而送了出來，這就是大概是海絨在海底下的生活的情形，</p>
<p>怎様得到海絨　涨絨旣是生在海底下，但是我們怎様去取得呢？這是有一種人，專門是收取海絨的，我們呌他們是收海絨者。丨他們在小孩子時候就已練習收海絨的丨當他們要收海絨的時候，們乘了一只小船，搖到海的中間··他們就拿大石繫於足上·繩子繫於身上，頸的周圍·圍了一只收海絨的大袋，手裏拿了長而委很尖銳的利刀，這様都預備完了··於是立刻就跳下水去，直達海底，他們就開始他們的工作，割下······至所能割下的數最，而後放在掛在頸周圍的大袋裏，割好以後，他們就立刻爬了起來，但是他們在海底下的時候，不可在三分鐘以上丨因過了三分鐘，恐就要掩死丨我們看收海絨者的生計·多麽是可怕啊！海絨的用處丨因爲海絨是有多孔有彈力有柔軟及光滑，所以我們用來洗掉在皮膚内爛的骯髒物，這是最好的功用了。</p>

<p>好是外國人，在丁古國某野鷄大學畢業，雖然已經有了未婚夫，可是因爲雙方家境都寒素，不能立即結婚，她不得已離了她的愛人，和可愛的故鄕，渡太平洋，來到這亞東的通商大埠丨上海，仗着自已是外國人，經朋友介紹，到我們學校裏來當英文敎員，預備藉此賺些錢，積蓄起來，做他們倆的結婚費，　　她實在値得被人家可憐了丨可是；同學們毫不能和她表同情，總是一味的胡鬧，亂説，説她的敎授法不好，敎本不好，其實，這都是英文系主任的主意，她想改變敎授法和敎本，那英文主任不答應，學生們看她不改變敎授法和敎本，就在上課時一此都不去理她，任她發間，求答，總是不理，她没有法子，只有哭，在學生面前哭，有時她氣忿了，説此後不再敎我們，於是就不待下課（）</p>
<p>走了，但是，第二天，郤仍然來上課，並且含着涙勸我們此後對她不要這様，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>是的，好學生聽了，此後一定不會再這様對她，只少想到她的窘境，而會加以憐惜，在上課時安靜些，可是，不幸，她碰着了這種學生，她愈是這様對待學生，學生愈當她是何木林，好欺侮，這様，一次，兩次，三次，······學生們鬧，她哭，她實在没有辦法，或許她在怨自已苦命，有時，她説到，或想到她的（）</p>

<p>這様　秋去春來，每天眼涙洗面的她，倒在我們校裏住了二年了，在九一八東省事件發生後，她很和我們表同情說··［孩子們，你們現在在想解决成人還不能解决的問題，我很願意帮助你們，倘使你們什麽地方需要着我的話］，果然，有一天，大約是耶穌聖誕前幾天，她呌我們各人寫封信，詳述日人侵略東省的實際情形，並且寫着要求給與我們一此帮助，或同情，能夠抵制日貨更好！她把這幾封信，分附在她寄給朋友，和親戚的賀年信裏，寄到美國去，她說··［這様可以使我的朋友，親戚，明瞭這次日本東侵的眞相，並且藉此一傳十，十傳百，···或許能得到些小帮助！］自然，這雖是細屑，可是也是國際宣傳的一種，在這一點上，我對於哭小姐表示敬意和謝忱！</p>

<p>— 勗予</p>
<p>闊别二年的珍，昨天忽然作了不速之客，琇妹欫欣然和她話舊，她却愁眉不展的歎道··［世事滄桑，禍福無常，我在這三年之中，迭經家難，備嘗艱苦，若非當年在校，求得這些區區的學識，賴以敎讀爲生，我現在早已成爲餳餓莩了丨］</p>
<p>琇妹狐疑地問道··［令先尊不是有很多的遺產嗎？你又何至至於吃苦？一　　她恨恨地說··［正因爲那些很多的遺產，而使我精神上感到無限的痛苦，唉丨假如先父在日，能夠善散其財，用於公益事業上，不留下這些害人精的遺產，那末我好那兩位英明有爲的兄長，也許不致於這様的墮落，而我這個快活的家庭，又何致於破敗到這種地步呢？　　說起來，眞堪痛心，父骨未寒，二哥和大哥，便作閱牆之爭，鬧着委深的意見。</p>
<p>原因是大哥一向在北平一家錢莊做賬房，月入有限，所以父親死後，母親便命大哥在家照應家務，免得遠道跃踄，横竪家中也要管理田地租賬的。</p>
<p>不料二哥忽然無端把天津銀行的職務辭了，回家道··［父親的遺產，大家都有份的，如今哥哥安然在家做少爺，所以我也不願去捧别人家飯碗，還是來大家共同管理家務吧。］</p>
<p>從此，一哥和大哥，　事事要比較，件件要同様，譬如大哥做了一件二百塊錢的狐皮袍，二哥也一定要照同橑、様的價値，一面九十九塊錢都不可以。</p>
<p>不但大哥和一哥如此，便是大嫂和二嫂也是如此，衣服首飾固然要逐様比較，便是一鞋　襪之微，也要彼此斤斤較量，絶對不肯馬處的。</p>
<p>父親在日，每逢秋收登塲之後，照例要到鄕下去收租，如今大哥說··［過不慣鄕下枯寂的生活，］不願去，二哥怕自已去了，大哥却在家大吃大玩的作樂，所以也不肯去。</p>
<p>結果寗願拿出錢來，另雇他人去，寗願讓他人中飽，却不肯讓同胞受用！　　大哥最愛喝白蘭地酒，一杯在手，便什麽都不官，二哥雖然不願讓他利益獨沾，但恨自已不胜酒力，喝了便要醉倒。</p>
<p>二哥恨得牙癢癢地道··［你喝美酒，我就抽大烟，］他辦了，套很精美的鴉片烟具，終日呑雲吐霧，起初原是借此洩氣，不過吸吸玩的　可是吸了二三個月後，便漸漸的弄假成眞，上了讔癮，欲罷不能。</p>
<p>大哥當然不肯示弱，於是兄弟兩人，一榻橫陳，弄得滿室烏烟瘴氣，終於大哥也染了芙蓉癖。</p>
<p>他們俾娪晝作夜，晨昏顚刽倒的沉淪黑籍，不但對於田地等租事假手於人，而且連到我家獨股所開的店務，也不過問，一任那些經手人，貓偷鼠竊的剝蝕精光。今年竟把交親生刻苦，艱蓶難所創的兩處布莊，弄得虧耗二三十萬，而遭倒閉了。</p>
<p>田地房屋，、也早被我那二位［難兄難弟］的大哥二哥，變賣化用，唉！一個好好的人家，如今竟弄得這様的一敗塗地，説起來好不傷心啊······］珍鳴咽着不能續說了。</p>

<p>他很快地包了一大包的書。</p>
<p>他的心靈似乎感到一陣傷感的情緒，覺得眞破落得太不像様了，；連這些平日寳愛得像性命一様的書籍，也要送到舊書攤上去了。</p>
<p>挾徉着這一大包的書跑出寄宿舍的時候，那房東太太恰巧站在門口，彷彿有些幾奇，上下的把他打量了一番，他匆遽地把頭下俯，不和她招呼，衝過去了。</p>
<p>走到馬路上了，剌骨的寒風吹着他，他覺得非常的寒冷，身子只索索的抖着，但是只顅挾了書默默地走着。馬路上是擁擠滿了人，互相在掙互着，喧　着，電車　一汽車，黄包車風馳電掣的經過，但似乎都與他没有什麽感想似的。走到一爿舊書店的門口，借着昏黃的燈光，他看收買舊書的牌子，他正想進去，却又立刻退了出來，他學得走進舊書店去賣書是一種可羞恥的，墮落的行爲。他拉拉帽子，還是徘徊在書店的門口，躊躇着不敢進去。</p>
<p>［我又不是偷了别人的書才來賣的，我是拿着乍自已心愛的舊書來賣的，這是正大光明的舉動，有什麽怕羞呢？進去吧！要解决自已的生活問題，不得不如此，鼓起勇氣進去！］他把帽子拉到了眉際，終於走進了門去。</p>
<p>［先生！你要買什麽書？］</p>
<p>］不，我人幾本舊書，請你看看要不要？］他勉强着説也了幾句話。　　［你要多少錢？］一個夥計走近來，將幾本書翻了一下，向他丢了一個鄙夷的眼光，懶懶地問着。</p>
<p>你説！］</p>
<p>［不，你的東西，應該你自已說的。］</p>
<p>［五塊錢！］看了那傢伙鄙夷不屑的態度，他再也不敢多開口了。</p>
<p>［不要，］那伙計直截了當的說。</p>
<p>［依你說，値多少錢呢？］</p>
<p>［一隻洋！］</p>
<p>他嚇得幾乎跳了起來，，想馬上把那夥計重重的打上兩巴掌，値十念元的書籍，只値一元錢！這眞是笑話，恐怕他還當這些書是從别人家偷來的呢！現在我　使　，也不能這様賤價的拍賣去的，當日買來的時候，也是煞費丁苦心才到手的。</p>
<p>［那麽便宜？至少三塊丨······］</p>
<p>［不要！］那夥計用着不眯的神氣，返身走開了。</p>
<p>他憤怒地離開了這書店，覺得受了極大的恥辱，團憤怒的炎，在心中炎炎地燃燒着，在熱鬧的街市上，挾着一大包書走着了。</p>

<p>秋風吹着枯萎的樹梢，發出　　的聲童，這時田中的稻都已收割，村莊上一片打稻的聲音，正是秋收的時侯了。在這村莊上中的一角，有一所茅屋，是佃農張三的屋子，這時有三個小孩，正在問着張三。一個年約十三四歲，一個年約六七歲，大概是他的兒子，他們從田間還來，正在向着父親提出要求。</p>
<p>爸爸！新衣服該給我買了，前村田主家　李榮官的新衣，已經穿在身上了。十三四歲時的小兒望着父親說。</p>
<p>爸爸！街上那洋貨店中的小洋人，你幾時給我買呢？六七歲的小孩也喊着。</p>
<p>孩子們！不要鬧！我們那裏鶆的錢，買奢侈品呢？父親沉沉地説着，嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>父親；我們不是收了許多稻嗎？賣汧</p>
<p>下來就有許多錢呢？較大的孩子不信的問。</p>
<p>我們還要還租，還要還我們所欠人家的錢，並且今年打仗，我們的牛也給軍隊牽去了，錢還没有還清呢？老農夫細細地說給二個小孩聽。</p>
<p>洋囡囡我要······新衣裳我也要，横豎我們今年收成很好呢？小孩們仍舊懇求着。</p>
<p>今年收成雖好，一畝田收到三石，但也爲了收成好，賣不起價錢，祇賣六七元一石，算起來比去年大水還不如，唉！賺錢的，只有做商意人，我那裏有錢給你們買這些東西呢？你看！我穿的衣服破得有多少洞。</p>
<p>那魔榮官爲什麽穿得這様美麗，我們郤没有呢？</p>
<p>因爲他們有錢有田產，所以一切都有。</p>
<p>他們旣有錢，爲什麽還要我們還他租米呢？</p>
<p>不要多說，時候已不早了，你們快牽牛吃草去吧；你們的蚽西，等到明年收成好些，再給你們買吧！</p>

<p>有聲電影，發明於美人安迪生，突飛猛進，以有今是；吾人不得不佩西人凡一事業之創造，日求進步之神速也。憶民海上電影，猶未發達，所演影片，亦甚幼穉；今則影院林立，不讓歐西，所演各片，多爲新出之品，滬上誠第二之巴黎哉！即以國產電影而論，縱不能與外媲美，進步之速，殊堪驚人，誰得不謂好現象乎？</p>
<p>吾人旣不能遨遊世界，增廣見聞，其唯一補救之方，即觀電影。以少數之代價，得臥遊世界之名都，斐美之蠻荒，埃及波斯之故墟，沙漠兩極之奇偉，此愚之所以好觀風景戲者，一也。夫勞勞人世，唯情感足以調劑其枯寂之生活；觀正當之愛情片，足以補滿情天，塡平恨海，又堪以增進伉儷之情，此愚之所以好觀言情戲者，二也。處茲人心澆漓之世，魅魑搏人，罔兩遍地，棘地荆天，落穽堪虞；觀偵探名片，足以啓發思想，增廣新智，此愚之所以好觀偵探戲者，三出。蠻荒殊俗，峭壁汪洋，探險之徒，遨遊其間，旣增勇冒險之心，又獲聞見之廣，此愚之所以好觀冒險戲者，四也。雖然，國產電影之能合於上述四呈者，不易多觀，此外國電影之所以受人歡迎也乎？</p>

<h3 id="c224">［蒙的卡羅一美人］ <a href="#c224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>蒙的卡羅，給我們的印像是很深的，並不是由地理上告訴我們，他是墨拿哥的城市，是由電影上，麥唐娜和巴淦南，告訴我們，牠是一個風景絶佳的賭城，現在卡爾登的ＷornanFromMonteCarlo開映了，因爲受示于蒙的卡羅四個字，許多人都希望一觀究竟吧？</p>
<p>主角是歐州古情人，麗爾黛哥娃ＬiljDagover她被聘到好萊塢，這是第一次出品，她能把平常述事似的劇情，演得恰到好處，差不多一齣戲中，她擔任了多一半工作，给觀衆極端的滿意，男主角華特赫斯登ＷalterHuston，和華倫威廉WarrenWnllam，表演得有紅花綠葉之妙，</p>
<p>劇情很簡單，只是表示出一幕海上的悲劇，因爲情塲的爭執，引起了極大的不幸，把兩艦的戰爭，當作這悲劇爆發的焦點，牠明顯的指出，女子之爲禍源，足以牽動到一切，在法庭上一幕，更用愛，垢，友，恨，感情，理智，和責任，種種的當面衝突，激成一個極高峯，這是導演手腕的成績，而末尾，又用蒙的卡羅的美景，和昇平歌舞，使緊張悲慘，一轉急下，成一種消閒的逸致，好似一聲苦笑，迴繞在觀衆的腦海中，表面的風平浪靜，返照前情，給我們更深的回憶，！感動！</p>
<p>有許多佈景，是很偉大的，特别在兵艦下沉的一幕，</p>
<p>組織，光線，攝影，都不錯，對白更是可誇的，差不多，每一個字，都會跑到我們耳裏去，這不完全因爲牠收音清晰，實在他的一些演員，多數是英國人，所以操着中肯而精純的，語言，無形中增加了表演的力量，</p>
<p>總之，由這一片的證明，第一轼哝公司的出品，是有長足的進涉，</p>

<p>— 星</p>
<p>凡　爾瑪彭開和開各我們闊别了三年多了。她自從和洛德拉羅格RodLaRooque結婚以後，雖然多少報紙和私人的信扎，請求她也演，但是她至終堅决的離棄了銀幕，過圓滿的家庭生活去了。</p>
<p>消息傳來，今年夏天，她突然的又和環球公司訂了一張合同，而重作馮婦，再上鏡頭。片名是IheRobel，係由［國門之戰裏］的LuisTrenker導演兼男主角。</p>
<p>請大家不要誤會。一個女明星。結婚以後，再上銀幕，並不一定是離了緍咸遇見了别的不幸事件。因爲倘以這個通例來推測彭開的重上銀幕，那就差之千里了。她的攝片，是完全出於一種興趣，他丈夫也很贊成的。</p>
<p>這張片子到將出版時。人才知道。</p>
<p>並不是環球或她個人，要保守什麽秘密，實在因爲牠的内景外景，都没有在好萊塢拍演。所以這片子的消息，事前極少人知道　丨</p>
<p>當彭開脫離銀幕的時候，正是聲片方盛，於是許多人就造了許多謠言，說她聲音不好，所以不能攝聲片。現在呢？The·Rcbel分明是聲片，又打破了一個啞謎。</p>
<p>大家不要喜歡，因爲她只訂了一張片子的合同。也許她從此不高興再拍第二張。不過曇花一現，也足以安慰渴望她一二年的影迷了！</p>

<p>史泰恩漢姆的一生（下）忍　　公</p>
<p>的確，這所理髮大學，對於史氏以後的經歷，不僅極有關聯，且是極有助力的。蓋史氏單是學習些櫛和鋏的使用方法，而對於一般裝飾術，也研究了不少的工夫；尤其因他養成了審美的情操，所以對於［坐談術］［更有獨到之處。例如主顧在一時間内，應該怎様與之周旋，更進而爲精神娛樂底供給，將他們剛强的性格，化爲温柔的情緒。像以上這些，都爲史氏在校内最重要的科目。質言之，這就是他後日成功的基礎。</p>
<p>到了現在，有許多人在他的周圍從事於著述，證明這位櫛和鋏的藝術家，是一個不尋常的導演。因此，我們在他的影片中出塲的男女演員，也往往可以見着一般俳優所意想不到的坐談術，而形成了他個人在藝術上優越的地位。就這</p>
<p>一點看，那所理髮大學的科目，確曾給史氏以莫大的僵力而無可否認的了。</p>
<p>在史氏十六歲那一年，和一個公寓的姑娘呌　做格雷泰的發生了變愛。他的處女作長篇喜劇［廻憶，］即是描寫他那時代底境遇的。後來史氏終於遭了愛的失望，因而對於影片底見解，反對團圓主義Happyendegr爲本位。換句話說，他的人生觀和變愛觀，爲着這層關係，便起了很大的震撼了。</p>
<p>又當史氏修畢了理髮學士的課程後，就離開了那饒有古風的大學區和洗濯女的母親　，而决定來到了首都柏林，自然，一個内地人初來大都會找職業，是一件很固難的事。史氏也免不了這個例，他最先是挑石炭，以後便是從事於郵局信差，刑務所屬理髮師，巡查員，道工人，等三十八種之多的各種名譽與不名譽的職業，最後，他想從事於最不名譽中的［活動役者］那上面去　，誰知這是非人道的生活，也可以說是背神者的行爲，所以結果還是給望。</p>
<p>那時，即一九○五年，柏林還没有所謂攝影塲，如果要攝影的時候，必得在偉大的建築物底屋基上面，利用自然光線而從事的。若是碰着雨天，那就無法可想了。但不久就發明水跟燈。可民在室内自由地攝影。燈光的强弱。也絶不受任何方的牽關；這様，便有了所謂電影導演制度，我們的櫛鋏藝術家史泰恩漠姆先生，就從這時起（一九○六年）出没於水銀燈底下了。（完）</p>
<p>曼麗畢克馥改飾中年婦華·　　曼麗畢克馥的所以引人歡迎及愛好的特徵，便　是她美麗的捲髮，短的裙子，及無限天眞爛漫的小孩子脾氣，因此吸引了無數觀衆的愛好。</p>
<p>可是如今，曼麗的青春的時代，已漸漸銷逝了，這是使她最傷心的一回事。在她最近作品，（訓悍記，）弄情女子，二片中，我們已找不到這些可愛的情狀了。總之，現在的她，一切不是從前的她了，</p>
<p>可是！以前幾張片子，何以仍能得到觀衆的歡迎呢？這無非是她忠實誠懇的情狀，還能得到觀衆的同情罷了。，</p>
<p>如今，她旣是個中年婦人，所以她决定改去她可愛的少女裝束，而換上樸實誠懇的中年婦女　的裝束，再圖重上銀幕，繼續表演，但據五　般人的料想，她的結果恐怕還是失敗哩。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Establishment of a Tomb for Unnamed Heroes <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The January 28th Shanghai Anti-Japanese War was the only most meaningful and valuable war in our country in recent decades. Its tragic and stirring nature is not only sufficient to leave the glory of our nation's history forever, but it is also sufficient to make public justice and righteousness last forever. The Battle of Miaohang Baziqiao was the most intense battle in this war, and the sacrifices made in this battle were the most tragic. Today, the setting sun, desolate grass, and war trenches are still there. Blood-stained land and white bones support the sky. When we wander among them, we feel the poison of the artillery fire on that day, and the tragic situation of our loyal and brave soldiers fighting against the violent power for the sake of defending our country and upholding justice is still vividly displayed before us. Therefore, people near Shanghai initiated the construction of a tomb for unnamed heroes in Miaohang to commemorate this battle. The foundation stone laying ceremony was held on the 14th. This is a truly appropriate and meaningful undertaking.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Republic of China, our country has been plagued by internal wars (except for meaningful revolutionary wars). In each civil war, the number of soldiers who died under gunfire is countless. However, this kind of war only serves as a tool for individuals, and sacrifices for individuals have no meaning at all. The Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai not only defends our nation, but also maintains world peace. It not only strengthens our national spirit, but also promotes public justice and righteousness. It not only warns internal traitors, but also frustrates external violence, revitalizes our national spirit, and renews the ears and eyes of international people. If we compare this war with previous internal wars, and compare the sacrifices in this war with the sacrifices in previous internal wars, its value and significance cannot be compared at all. Therefore, the creation of this tomb can be said to be honoring meritorious service and repaying virtue, or to enlighten future generations. It can be said to be remembering the loyal and martyrs, or to establish a model. When this tomb is completed in the future, all warlords and politicians who are brave in internal wars but only care about personal interests and do not hesitate to harm the people and the country will undoubtedly feel ashamed and dare not look up when they come to this tomb. This will further demonstrate the noble greatness of the [Unnamed Heroes] and the urgency of the establishment of this tomb.</p>
<p>Moreover, after the European War, all participating countries built tombs for unnamed heroes to show respect for the national war dead. However, the essence of the European War was a civil war among imperialists. It is difficult to determine who was the aggressor and who was defending themselves, and it is not easy to distinguish between right and wrong. Therefore, the establishment of the tomb of unnamed heroes after the war, although the builders regarded it as the most respectable and regarded the soldiers as brave men who went to benevolence and righteousness, in our view, its significance is nothing more than propaganda for militarists. In the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai, Japan was the aggressor and we were defending ourselves, which is recognized by the world. We appealed to the international community, but the international community sat idly by waiting for the judgment of justice, which is also hopeless. Finally, we mustered our determination to die and sought self-defense and self-rescue by our own strength. The enemy held good weapons, and we relied on our hot blood to fight hard for more than a month, making the powerful enemy terrified and the world shocked. We fought for the life of our nation in a precarious situation and preserved public justice in a state of destruction. Its tragedy and greatness are enough to move heaven and earth and weep ghosts and gods, and compete with the sun and moon for glory. This is enough to demonstrate the great achievements of the unnamed heroes and the great significance of the establishment of this tomb.</p>
<p>Alas, a wisp of setting sun, a handful of yellow soil, the dead are gone. They died for the nation and for justice, and their glory will last forever. Even if they are unnamed, what does it matter? Even if there is no tomb, what does it matter? Only we are in today's situation where the national crisis is becoming more and more urgent and the situation is precarious. Instead of looking at the past, we should pay attention to the present. Instead of commemorating the martyrs, we should encourage ourselves. Instead of making passive mourning, we should trample on the blood of the martyrs and continue to move forward. The lost land in the Northeast has not been recovered, and the rebellions in Shandong, Sichuan, and Guizhou are following one after another. How will we Chinese people deal with ourselves?</p>

<p>Yesterday's resolution of the Central Committee</p>
<p>) Nanjing (The Central Committee held the 47th Standing Committee meeting of the 4th Central Executive Committee at 9:00 a.m. on the 17th. The Central Committee members present were Gu Mengyu, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Ju Zheng, Zhu Peide, Shao Yuanchong, Chu Minyi, Chen Shuren, Shi Ying, Chen Lifu, Zeng Zhongming, Yong Youren, etc. More than 30 people were chaired by Gu Mengyu. The following is an excerpt of the important cases discussed:</p>
<p>1. Jiang Zhongzheng, Wu Jingheng, Shang Zhen, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Cheng Tianfang, Yu Jingtang, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Dai Chuanxian, Gu Mengyu, Chu Minyi, He Yaozu, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Jiahua, Zeng Zhongming, Zhou Qigang, Shi Ying, Gu Zhenggang, and 24 committee members proposed that the central party headquarters, the national government, and the ministries and commissions be moved back to Nanjing. The decision was that the central party headquarters, the national government, and the ministries and commissions would be moved back to Nanjing on December 1.</p>
<p>2. Jiang Zhongzheng, Wu Jingheng, Shang Zhen, Song Ziwen, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Cheng Tianfang, Yu Jingtang, Wu Dangcheng, Zhang Jun, Dai Chuanbao, Gu Mengyu, Zhu Minyi, He Yaozu, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Jiahua, Zeng Zhongming, Zhou Qigang, Shi Ying, Gu Zhenggang, and 24 committee members proposed that the construction of Chang'an Auxiliary Capital and Luoyang Secondary Capital be carried out in a solid manner.</p>
<p>Main points of the original proposal</p>
<p>(A) Regarding Chang'an Yangdu, in order to unify the authority, Chang'an should be changed to a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan, which is also responsible for the construction of the auxiliary capital. The urban area should be based on the auxiliary capital plan to determine the appropriate party area. The funds for the city should be raised by the national treasury.</p>
<p>(B) Regarding Luoyang Secondary Capital</p>
<p>(A) Establish a branch of the Central Military Academy and rebuild the old barracks in Xigong. The purpose of this school is to train talents for Yicheng's reclamation and border planting, integrating agriculture, forestry, education, military affairs, and education into one, in order to improve Northwest military affairs, open up construction sites, and enrich the foundation of national defense. The local affairs of Luoyang can also be maintained by the school, and the people's wisdom and life can be benefited by the school. This case should be handed over to the Military Affairs Committee to be handled quickly.</p>
<p>(B) Establish a Central Plains Social Education Center in order to open up the people's wisdom, improve society, and revitalize righteousness.</p>
<p>(C) Build a Central Plains National Museum in the local scenic spots to enhance the cultural value of Luoyang and develop the local economy to enrich the people's livelihood. The start-up funds for the Social Education Center and the Museum should be allocated from the Gengkuan funds, and the annual funds should be raised from the central education funds. This case should be handed over to the Ministry of Education to handle.</p>
<p>(D) The Luoyang Bridge Project is of great importance to the people's livelihood and is also a famous scenic spot in ancient times. The local government is unable to build it due to water damage. A construction plan should be decided to quickly repair it, both to facilitate the people and as a memorial to the central government's relocation to Luoyang. This case should be completed by the Ministry of Communications and Transportation.</p>
<p>The decision was handed over to the Political Council for proper deliberation and preparation.</p>
<p>3. The implementation plan for improving the organization and activities of the party headquarters below the county and city levels was designated to be piloted by the party headquarters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Nanjing city party headquarters. The decision was passed.</p>
<p>4. The constitution and implementation rules of the Women's Association were passed.</p>
<p>5. The proposal for the implementation of political training in the group regiments in various provinces was handed over to the Organization Committee for detailed deliberation and implementation.</p>
<p>6. The Supervisory Committee sent a letter requesting the amendment of the regulations on punishing party members for not attending the plenary meeting of party members in the entire region without reason. The decision was passed in accordance with the amended proposal.</p>
<p>It is heard that more than a dozen other precedents were discussed until the meeting adjourned at 12:00 (17th Central News Agency telegram)</p>
<p>Preparation is due to the fact that the League of Nations has not yet formally notified our side at this time (17th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beijing (The League of Nations Executive Council has only three days left. Regarding the trend of the meeting and how the International Committee is beneficial or harmful to us, the Central News Agency reporter recently inquired from diplomatic circles and learned that the atmosphere of the League of Nations towards us is currently quite good. This meeting will decide to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute based on the Lytton Report. First, listen to the opinions of both China and Japan on the first eight chapters of the report. Chapters nine and ten are suggestions and do not have hard and restrictive requirements. The Executive Council will not make a decision on whether to adopt them. The Executive Council will meet for about two weeks to collect opinions from all parties and then send them to the Committee of Nineteen for research and signing of opinions, which will be sent to the special meeting. The special meeting will be held in about January next year. Whether to adopt the international committee system will be decided by the special meeting. However, the current atmosphere is strong and the general assembly has a tendency to implement it. Our Foreign Affairs Committee has added research on this, but since this matter has not yet been seen in the facts, no decision has been made on accepting or rejecting it. The International Committee has decided to invite the United States and Russia to participate. This is an organ established by the League of Nations separately. Although Japan opposes it, there is no reason to prevent its realization. However, the establishment period will be approximately in March and April next year, after Roosevelt takes office. In terms of nature, the participation of the United States and Russia concentrates the power of the whole world to exert power and oppression on Japan. Moreover, the measures set by the meeting will be implemented immediately, unlike the League of Nations resolution that can be delayed and ignored. This fundamentally conflicts with Japan's usual delaying tactics and its claim that third parties are not allowed to participate, which is what Japan fears and opposes the most. However, our country should not observe the advantages and disadvantages in this way. The advantages and disadvantages lie entirely in the people's self-determination. There are still three or four months before the establishment of the meeting. How the people use this period is the divergence of advantages and disadvantages. Since the September 18th Incident, people in various countries have implemented economic sanctions against Japan, and Japan's economy has been greatly affected. Coupled with the impact of the world's economic downturn, the sales of Japanese goods to Europe and the United States have stagnated. Huge military expenditures have made Japan's economy extremely chaotic. For example, the exchange rate of one Japanese yen was worth two yuan and four corners of the national currency, but now it has fallen to nine corners and tends to fall to eight corners. One U.S. dollar was worth two Japanese yen, but now it is worth five yuan. Japan's domestic and foreign debts have invisibly increased by more than double. The national budget is insufficient by 900 million yuan, and the industrial and commercial sectors are declining. The national economy is heading for bankruptcy. If we continue to implement economic sanctions, Japan's economy will inevitably be irreparable in three or four months. In addition, the momentum of the Northeast Volunteer Army is increasing day by day, and refugees cannot make a living and have joined the Volunteer Army. The rebel army revolts every day. Japan can no longer cope with the north. Japanese residents in the south are also uneasy. If the Volunteer Army is provided with a steady stream of supplies, the Japanese army will inevitably be exhausted and cause the people to unanimously oppose the government. Therefore, the next three or four months are the key to the survival of the country and the nation, and the victory or defeat of diplomacy. If the people unite and act independently and exert their own strength, then when the International Committee is convened, without waiting for the great powers to force and oppress us, we will be able to sanction the violent Japan (17th Central News Agency telegram)</p>

Japan believes that all the words and deeds of the envoys traveling south are sufficient to influence international public opinion, so it sent its intelligence personnel to this place to mediate among the envoys to find out the inside story. Our foreign affairs authorities believe that the envoys should be stationed in the location of the National Government for a long time. Due to various reasons, this has not been achieved.

<p>(Nanjing) The 24th Army Office in Beijing issued a telegram from Chengdu: At dawn on the 14th, the Chongqing army launched a general offensive on all fronts, using wooden boats and bamboo rafts to install steel plates and machine guns to forcibly cross the Tuojiang River. The artillery fire was like a flood. The provincial army guarded the Tuojiang River, and the Chongqing army sank and lost quite a lot of people while crossing halfway. By noon, the general silence was restored on the 24th. The Chongqing army attacked the most fiercely from the salt terminal in Luzhou. More than one battalion had forcibly crossed and landed, but was repelled by the provincial army. A Chongqing-owned Jia wheel ship was attacked by the provincial army. The fighting in Fushun's Dongshu and Neijiang and Bimuqian was fierce. Fushuncheng and Neijiang were bombed by flying bombs, causing many deaths and injuries to the people. There were also many casualties among the defending troops in the city. On the 13th and 14th, Liu Xiang personally went to the front lines of Luzhou and Fushun to command, and changed the 2,000-man guard battalion into a law enforcement team, dispatching more than a dozen supervisors to distribute and supervise the battle on the front lines.

A unit of the 21st Army crossed the river at Dukuai Town, 30 miles southeast of Fushun, and attacked the south of Fushun, and will directly attack the Jingguan in the southwest of Fushun, making it impossible for the provincial army to respond. The 21st Army troops have detoured from the south to the west of Luzhou City, cutting off the traffic between the province and Luzhou.

British Foreign Secretary Simon seems to agree with this view.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th - According to a telegram from the Japanese delegation in Geneva to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, Secretary-General Drummond and League of Nations Affairs Bureau Director Yota Sugimura agreed that because the appendices to the Lytton Report were written by specialized committee members under their individual responsibility, it was decided not to use them as the basis for the Council's discussions.

<p>Reuters, London, 16th - The Lower House Private Members' Economic Committee advocated that the national budget and local government expenditures be greatly reduced to save money. It hoped that this would save more than £100 million in British gold. The committee released a report advocating the abolition of the wartime-established Ministry of Transport, as it was only necessary to meet wartime needs and should not be maintained for long. In addition, it also advocated stopping housing subsidies and road construction costs, ending the Overseas Trade Department, extending the office hours of civil servants, and reducing employee salaries. After the report was released, Conservative Party members of Congress rose up to oppose it, saying that it should not be published abruptly without the full consideration of the Congressional Committee.</p>

<p>Prince of Wales Visits Northern Ireland for the First Time</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th - The tariff war between Great Britain and the Irish Free State has severely affected the Free State. According to Colonial Affairs Minister Thomas in the Lower House today, three months before the tariff war began, on March 14, the report from Dublin stated that there were only 30,396 unemployed people in the Irish Free State. A report on October 12 revealed that the economic war was in full swing at that time, and the number of unemployed people was almost three times higher than before, totaling 88,376.</p>
<p>Reuters, Belfast, 16th - The Prince of Wales arrived here for the first time on a visit to Northern Ireland to hold the inauguration ceremony of the new parliament building. Crowds along the way welcomed him, and all the shops displayed flags. Two to three thousand people holding British flags poured into Stormont Park, forcing the park gates to be temporarily closed. The crowds cheered wildly as the Prince of Wales entered the country, and only stopped after the national anthem was played. The Prince of Wales will stay in Northern Ireland for three days, touring various scenic spots and inspecting industries.</p>

<p>Romania Will Send Representatives to Investigate</p>
<p>TASS, Vienna, 16th - The impact of the global economic crisis has made countries feel the importance of planned economies. Even Romania, which is on the front line of conflict with the Soviet Union, will be forced to study the Soviet planned economy to save itself. Recently, the Romanian Engineers' Annual Meeting held a meeting in Brașov and passed a motion asking the government to organize an engineers' delegation to the Soviet Union to investigate the planned economy. The chairman of the meeting, Menno Lysso, said in a speech that only the planned economy and rationalization measures implemented by the Soviet Union can save Romania's economic bankruptcy. At that time, a representative interjected and said that such remarks would put all the members in prison. Menno Lysso replied that even if there was a risk of imprisonment, it could not make us ignore this only method to save the Romanian economy. Romania must currently have the courage to break superstitions and prejudices and transform the entire economic and social structure.</p>

<p>Unstable Plan Broken Up by Police Department</p>
<p>The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun reports that the Independent Youth Society, a right-wing group, plotted to assassinate important figures during the grand military exercise. Some of the main culprits were arrested. Unexpectedly, left-wing groups also schemed to act during the grand military exercise. The unstable plan of a left-wing group in Hyogo Prefecture was investigated and exposed by the prefectural police department, and several people were arrested. The mastermind reportedly fled to Tokyo upon hearing the news. Recently, several packages of unstable documents, such as "Proletarian News" and information about the municipal electric railway movement, totaling thirteen types and over six thousand copies, were suddenly discovered at Ueno Station in Tokyo. At the same time, three thousand several hundred copies of similar flyers were also found at Akihabara Station. According to the Kokumin Shimbun, the unstable plan, centered on Kobe, to assassinate government officials traveling west has now been exposed. In addition to arresting a dozen radical activists, many more criminals are hiding in the Kansai region. These individuals have been actively operating in secret for two or three months. Among those arrested are one woman and two Koreans, all of whom have become radicalized due to their ideologies.</p>

<p>German Papen Cabinet Resigns</p>
<p>Important Cabinet Meeting Held Last Night</p>
<p>Negotiations with Various Parties Have Failed</p>
<p>A Berlin dispatch from the Kokuminsha on the 17th reports that Chancellor Papen will meet with President Hindenburg this afternoon to submit the entire cabinet's resignation, allowing the President to act freely. Papen's move is due to the Central Party leader announcing that while they do not oppose the principle of a national concentration cabinet, they see Papen as a major obstacle. However, forming a new cabinet may be difficult because the Central Party and the National People's Party have not yet reached an agreement. Since the last election, these two parties, combined with the Bavarian People's Party, only hold 284 out of 585 seats in the Reichstag. However, if they were to combine with the German National People's Party and the People's Party, they could hold a majority of 347 seats. However, the German National People's Party and the People's Party have traditionally supported the Papen cabinet and are difficult to integrate. Therefore, the positions of the various parties today are still quite chaotic and unpredictable. As for who will succeed Papen after his resignation, opinions vary widely. The newspapers of the German National People's Party and the Democratic Party both claim that Papen himself may be the one to form the next cabinet.</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 17th reports that the political situation here is gradually deteriorating, and whether Chancellor Papen can retain his position is now in question. This morning, it was widely rumored here that the Chancellor and other cabinet members would hold an important meeting tonight to decide whether he should resign. This news has not been confirmed today.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 17th reports rumors that Chancellor Papen will submit his cabinet's resignation to President Hindenburg tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ A Berlin dispatch from the Kokuminsha on the 16th reports that the sudden rumor today that the Papen cabinet may resign en masse after tomorrow's cabinet meeting has caused anxiety throughout Germany. Furthermore, due to the results of this general election, a majority group cannot be formed in the Reichstag. If the Papen cabinet resigns, it is difficult to predict what will happen in the future, further worrying the Germans. The Vossische Zeitung, known for its reliable sources, reported today that Chancellor Papen is currently planning to meet with the President tomorrow evening and submit his personal resignation at that time, and the entire cabinet may resign even earlier. As a result, rumors of the cabinet's imminent resignation are rampant, and all parties are deeply concerned that the National Socialist Party will take advantage of this opportunity to attempt a coup.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Negotiations Break Down <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>A Berlin dispatch from the Kokuminsha on the 16th reports that after the Social Democratic Party unconditionally refused to negotiate with Chancellor Papen, the Central Party and Bavarian People's Party leaders' talks with Papen broke down today and issued a declaration tonight, surprising many. Judging from the wording of the statement, the Central Party and others have decided to refuse to cooperate with Papen. The statement said that the talks over the past few days have proven the impossibility of organizing a national concentration cabinet. However, the German People's Party leader, Dingert, told Papen that the party was willing to give him full support, but this move was not enough to consolidate Papen's position. Papen also seemed to be aware of this, so he canceled his trip to Stuttgart tomorrow and plans to convene a special cabinet meeting at noon on Thursday to consider the overall situation. Currently, rumors are flying around, saying that the political situation will change soon, and some are speculating that the National Socialist Party will come to power. President Hindenburg must first have the successor to the prime minister explain the administrative plan and protect the support of the majority of the Reichstag before he can actually grant the mandate. This condition cannot be fulfilled by the National Socialist Party, because the party insists that all power must belong to Hitler and that the current political and economic plans of the party must be implemented. As for the National Socialist Party's attitude towards cooperating with Papen in a national concentration cabinet, nothing is known at present. Even the party's various leaders do not know what to do, and everything depends on the party leader Hitler.</p>
<p>▲ A Reuters dispatch from Berlin on the 16th reports that after being abandoned by the Socialist Party, Chancellor Papen is now in contact with the leaders of the Central Party, the German People's Party, and the Bavarian People's Party. Talks will continue this week. Papen originally planned to travel to the south, but because he urgently wants to meet with National Socialist Party leader Hitler, which is of great importance, he has canceled the trip. Hitler has received a letter requesting a meeting, but wants to postpone the reply for 24 hours to make a final decision. The Socialist Party leader refused to meet Papen. On Monday, Papen will report to President Hindenburg on his views on organizing a concentration cabinet, but it is expected that his cabinet formation work will not be easy because the opposition in the Reichstag is in the majority.</p>
<p>▲ A Havas dispatch from Berlin on the 16th reports that Chancellor Papen intends to unite various political parties to form a national cabinet. Apart from the People's Party, which has eleven members in the House of Representatives, all other political parties have refused to accept it. The National Socialist Party did not reply, while the Catholic parties replied that they could not participate in such a cabinet until the government's approach was changed. Although Chancellor Papen is not discouraged by this, he hopes that after President Hindenburg consults with the various political parties, the party will know that the House of Representatives has no leader and will grant the current cabinet the power to dissolve it at an opportune time.</p>

<p>No Use of Force to Resolve Difficulties Under Any Circumstances</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from Geneva on the 17th reports that British Foreign Secretary Simon stated at the main office of the Disarmament Conference today that he fully recognized that Germany should have equal treatment in armament. Simon said that the French disarmament proposal was too complicated and confusing to criticize rashly, which would not only be unwise but also impossible. Germany should have equal rights in law, first based on the Treaty of Versailles, which has binding force and cannot be overturned by unilateral action; second, the introduction and Chapter 5 of the Treaty of Versailles and the declaration of French Prime Minister Clemenceau representing the Allied Powers all stated that the disarmament imposed on</p>
<p>Germany would be the precursor to general disarmament; third, although he did not ignore the extent of individual disarmament in several countries after the armistice, one thing had not changed: Germany continued to be under permanent restrictions, while other countries, except for the very important regions covered by the Washington and London Naval Treaties, still did not have mutual or agreed obligations to limit armaments. Weapons that Germany was not allowed to use under the treaty could still be used by other countries; fourth, Germany was a full member of the League of Nations with an undeniable right to an equal position in the League of Nations. Simon also said that the best way to achieve equality should be as follows: (1) All European countries should jointly solemnly declare that under any circumstances</p>
<p>No use of force to resolve any current or future difficulties (2) Germany's armament restrictions should be included in the same disarmament convention that restricts the armament of other countries (3) The newly stipulated German armament restrictions should have the same period as other countries' restrictions and apply the same amendment methods (4) Regarding the issue of armament inventory, if equal status is recognized, the principle of qualitative disarmament must be recognized. The British government is willing to work with other countries in the Disarmament Conference to include this principle in the new convention. Simon mentioned the British air disarmament proposal, saying that first, the air forces of major countries should be immediately reduced to be equal to the British Air Force; second,</p>
<h3 id="e62">A One-Third Reduction in the World's Air Force, Including <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Britain; third, to limit the carrying capacity of military aircraft to the lowest level agreed upon by all. As for the number of air force personnel, Britain is prepared to accept the Hoover proposal as a basis for discussion. Simon continued to say that the main purpose of the Disarmament Conference is to set the highest limits for quantitative disarmament so that all parties can agree. It is not possible to increase military strength in the name of equality. The second purpose is to establish a complete and practical understanding. It is generally known that the principle of equality cannot be achieved immediately, but only when the world is more stable after the first step is taken can it be achieved. Simon then spoke of the most urgent work of the Disarmament Conference, saying that it is necessary to formulate a real program for the first stage and, if possible, establish an outline for the second stage so that countries can coordinate their progress in advance. The Foreign Secretary continued to say that the British government believes that the following methods can be applied to the first stage: (1) Horizontal Disarmament Conference (2) The British government is currently working with major naval powers to agree on</p>
<p>When the Prime Minister met with many cabinet members, the political circles believed that the cabinet should submit its resignation to President Hindenburg so that the President could freely handle the matter. In addition, the general public denied that Chancellor Papen would resign to the President. As of 11:23 AM, the cabinet was still in session and would not announce a resolution until the evening. The reason was that Chancellor Papen would visit the President at 5 PM, and there would be no formal announcement until then. If President Hindenburg allows the current cabinet to resign, the most promising candidates to succeed him are Federal Deputy Administrative Officer of Prussia, Bracht, Minister of Defense Schleicher, and former Minister of Defense Gessler.</p>
<p>▲ A Havas dispatch from Berlin on the 17th reports that National Socialist Party leader Hitler recently submitted a memorandum to the Federal Cabinet stating that the National Socialist Party refused to negotiate with Chancellor Papen, but Hitler himself was prepared to submit a political program to President Hindenburg on the condition that Chancellor Papen not be present. Due to this attitude of the National Socialist Party, the cabinet decided to submit its resignation this afternoon. Political circles believe that President Hindenburg will temporarily allow the Papen government to resign and order it to handle administrative affairs. The President seems to personally summon the leaders of the various parties and entrust close confidants to conduct cabinet formation negotiations. The so-called confidants may be President's Office Secretary General Messner, Federal Deputy Administrative Officer of Prussia Bracht, or former Price Management Committee member Goerdeler. These figures cannot be immediately regarded as candidates for forming a cabinet.</p>
<p>A significant reduction in the caliber of guns, the tonnage of the main ships, and the total tonnage of the navy, and to demand that Germany be allowed to build warships of the same form as the major naval powers, as finally agreed upon. According to various information on this issue, the proposal to set the limit for battleships at 10,000 tons will inevitably fail. This is generally recognized. Any construction by Germany must not exceed the currently limited total tonnage of its various types of warships (but may be slightly changed). (3) The British government is willing</p>
<p>To limit cruisers to a maximum of 7,000 tons and equip them with 6-inch caliber guns (4) The British government has repeatedly advocated</p>
<p>That submarines should be completely abolished, as this is the greatest possible contribution to the Disarmament Conference and world peace, and as the best way to deal with Germany's demand for equality in armaments regarding this type of weapon.</p>
<p>As for tanks and armored vehicles, the British government fully agrees with the US proposal to ban those specifically used for offensive purposes. However, new light tanks and armored vehicles cannot be regarded as offensive. If they are banned across the board, Britain will need more manpower. Therefore, the British government proposes that tanks below a certain weight should be completely removed so that offensive tanks are prohibited. It cannot be denied that Germany has the right in principle to possess a certain number of tanks. However, whether this type of weapon should be applicable depends on considering the military uses of various countries. This matter should be discussed in Geneva, and Germany can participate. As for</p>
<p>Mobile land-based artillery, the obvious way to grant Germany equality and promote disarmament is to reduce the maximum caliber to 105 millimeters in all aspects. This caliber is what the treaty allows Germany. If international conventions stipulate this highest caliber, then future new constructions must not exceed this range. The Foreign Secretary finally spoke about the air force issue, reiterating Baldwin's recent remarks in the House of Commons, which included that current and future civilizations will be harmed by the air force and that if full efforts are not made to deal with it, this harm cannot be eliminated. The Foreign Secretary also said that some people believe that abolishing bombers everywhere in the world can guarantee the abolition of aerial bombardment. It is important to know that this statement is not necessarily effective because aircraft can be temporarily modified. However, the British government is willing to cooperate with other air powers to study the complete abolition of</p>

The magistrate declared that he wanted a second bailor, also for 500 pounds. As soon as this was said, a short-haired, hatless young woman stepped forward and identified herself as Mrs. Allen, willing to post bail. According to the court's investigation, Ellis received instructions from the Third International in Russia last September and acted accordingly. A letter was copied from Moscow, containing suggestions for inciting unrest in England.</p>

<p>A Dentsu dispatch from Tokyo on the 17th reports that with Minister Okada reaching the age of retirement in January of next year, his advancement or retreat has attracted much attention from all sides, with both retention and resignation theories. According to observations within his department, it is believed that based on General Okada's usual beliefs and recent attitude, he will definitely retire bravely. Regarding the timing of his resignation, Navy Minister Okada is also carefully considering that if the decision to advance or retreat is made in the middle of this month, there is a risk of political maneuvering before the parliament convenes. If the decision is made at the time of his retirement, it will be in the middle of the parliamentary session, and there may be obstacles to the new Navy Minister attending the parliament. Therefore, the middle of December is generally considered to be an appropriate time. Prime Minister Saito and the cabinet members are doing their best to persuade Navy Minister Okada to stay in order to avoid political changes. However, since taking office after the May 15 Incident, the Navy Minister believes that he has put the three or two major tasks of revitalizing the morale of the department, replenishing troops, and forming a budget in order, and that it is an appropriate time to resign. Whether he will accept the Prime Minister's advice to stay is highly questionable.</p>

Prime Minister Saito will serve as the chairman. In order to achieve practical results, the investigation committee will be composed of the five ministers, including Minister of Finance Takahashi, Minister of Railways Thirty, Minister of Home Affairs Yamamoto, Minister of Agriculture Goto, and Minister of Commerce Nakajima, rather than a mere investigation committee as before. It can be said that it is a five-ministry conference to save the current situation, without setting up official positions, and will convene at any time to investigate and study financial plans, which will be reported by the Prime Minister at the cabinet meeting, and consent will be sought. ▲ A Dentsu dispatch from Tokyo on the 17th reports that Navy Minister Okada visited Minister of Finance Takahashi at 1:10 PM today to report on the items in the Navy's revival budget and to hold a discussion centered on the Navy's budget.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Bloody Battle Between Two Lius in Luzhou <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Cables to Hankou Saying He Can Advance Straight In</p>
<p>Deng, Tian, and Yang Discuss Ending the War in the Province</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that the focus of the war between the two Lius in Sichuan has shifted to the Tuo River area since the 8th, with war clouds gathering densely between Fulu. Luzhou is particularly fierce. The provincial army guarding Luzhou is composed of the Yang and Tian brigades, with Division Commander Xia Zhongshi stationed in the city to command. Another six brigades are distributed along the Tuo River to guard the dangerous terrain. The attacking Chongqing army includes six brigades, including Chen Lanting, Liu Guangyu, Liao Haitao, Mu Yingzhou, Guo Xun, and He Chunwu, as well as the second squadron of aircraft and one warship. Among them, Liu Guangyu's brigade is known as the Divine Soldiers. For several days, both sides have fought fiercely, with countless deaths and no victory. When Liu Xiang issued the second order for a general attack, he had already launched an attack to recover the lost territory. He is constantly increasing his troops, determined to win. Liu Wenhui also believes that his lifeline is at stake and cannot retreat any further, so he is going all out to deal with him. Therefore, Luzhou is almost like a mountain of soldiers surrounded by smoke and continuous artillery fire, and innocent civilians are sacrificed by the two warlords. It is now heard that Liu Wenhui has secretly arrived in Luzhou from Zizhong to direct the defense, and reinforcements are constantly arriving. Liu Xiang has also gone to the front of Luzhou to supervise the battle across the river. The battle on the 14th and 15th was more intense than before, and it was heard that part of the Chongqing army had crossed the Tuo River at a great sacrifice, and it seemed that Luzhou could be captured. However, the 24th Army is also very strong and will never abandon the city and flee. It is expected that there will be more bloody battles in the coming days, as this is the only way to determine the winner. On the 16th, the Sichuan Post-War Rehabilitation Supervisor's Office in Hankou received two cables from Liu Xiang on the 15th, one of which reported on the war situation, saying that the enemy was trapped in the city of Luzhou, and the return route had been cut off. The main force was besieging Longtou Pass, five miles behind the city of Luzhou. The enemy was difficult to support, and the requested reinforcements were also defeated by Guo's brigade on the way. Although Long Pass is strong, it can be taken down at any moment. The enemy in Luzhou is like a turtle in a jar and only has two options: surrender or be annihilated. On the same day, three brigades were crossing at Hushi, and Pan's and Guo's brigades were also crossing the river at Datoucheng, so they could annihilate the enemy's reinforcements. Therefore, without attacking, the enemy will be defeated. I have suddenly increased five brigades between Luzhou and Fu, and the enemy's Tuo River defense line has been broken. My army can advance straight in. The other was for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which was sent by the office to Zhang Qun to be reviewed by Chiang. It mainly reported on the military situation. At a time when the two Lius are fighting to the death, the attitude of Deng, Tian, and others, who can make a significant difference, is extremely important. Deng and Tian are already one, but Deng seems to favor Liu Wenhui, while Tian seems to sympathize with Liu Xiang. After the Chengdu Agreement, Tian still occasionally demonstrated to the provincial army, causing outsiders to suspect. In fact, Deng and Tian have other plans. What they want is for the two Lius to be defeated on both sides. Deng's support for the provincial army is to give Liu Wenhui the determination to defend firmly. Tian's help to the Chongqing army is to give Liu Xiang the spirit to attack with all his strength. When both sides are exhausted, they will take advantage of it. At the moment, Deng, Tian, and Yang Sen are also convening a meeting of the various division commanders in Chengdu to discuss ending the war. Chen Dingxun, division commander of Deng's department, cabled Hankou on the 15th, saying, "Fu Gong (Zhang Qun's alias) personally directs the army, navy, and air force to launch a fierce attack in three routes on the provincial army stationed in Luzhou, Neijiang, Fulu, and other counties. In recent days, the various departments have fought fiercely and suffered heavy losses. Deng, Tian, and Yang are convening a meeting of the various division commanders in the province to end the Sichuan war in the short term and open up Chongqing and Wanxian." Also, Tian Songyao cabled his representative in Hankou, Yang Jinkang, saying, "Yue Jun (Zhang Qun's alias) has requested a ceasefire before the League of Nations General Assembly on the 21st, which is expected to be achieved." The inside story of the so-called meeting to end the war is impossible to know. From this, it can be seen the extent of the chaos in Sichuan and the actions of the various generals are even more difficult to fathom. (November 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Liu Zhennian's Troops Prepare for Transfer <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Liu's Troops to Be Transferred to the Eastern Zhejiang Area</p>
<p>Longkou to Be Taken Over by the Navy</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Although Liu Zhennian's 21st Division has been preparing for a transfer, there is no definite date for departure. Xiong Bin, who was ordered to go to Yexian, has been unable to depart due to illness and is very anxious. He previously telegraphed his secretary in Yexian, Lu Bangjian, to inquire about Liu's departure date. Today (15th), Lu has telegraphed Jinan, stating that Liu's troops have long been prepared to depart. However, due to the poor road conditions east of Yexian, they are currently ordering the troops to repair them. Once the roads are repaired in two or three days and the ships arrive, they can depart. The baggage and supplies will depart first. Liu's troops stationed in Laiyang are close to Yantai and will depart to board ships first. Xiong Bin's illness at the Dehua Hospital is gradually improving, but he is still fatigued and needs to rest for several days. The original plan to go to Yexian on the 16th will likely be postponed again.</p>
<p>As for the location where Liu's troops will be stationed, the Military and Political Department originally designated the Anlu and Suixian areas of Hubei Province. However, He Yingqin telegraphed Xiong Bin and Gao Lingbai yesterday, stating that he had received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, stating that due to opposition from the people of Hubei, Liu's troops would be transferred to Zhejiang first, landing in Ningbo and being stationed in eastern Zhejiang. The last brigade would go directly to Wenzhou and asked to inform Liu to pay attention to discipline to enhance the army's reputation. Xiong has telegraphed Liu Zhennian accordingly. Gao Lingbai, who is in Yantai, also telegraphed Xiong, reporting that he has exchanged several telegrams with Liu Zhennian and his deputy division commander, He Yisan. Liu has sent He to Yantai first to discuss the transfer. He is expected to arrive today or tomorrow. Qiu Wei, the director of the Transportation Department of the Military Affairs Commission, also telegraphed Xiong Bin, reporting on the situation of the ships transporting Liu's troops to Yantai. The telegrams are excerpted below: (He Yingqin's Telegram) Telegram to Director Xiong Zemin, Secretary Gao Lingbai, and Brother Lingbai: I have just received two telegrams from the Chairman at noon. Due to opposition from the people of Hubei, Liu Zhennian's troops will be transferred to Zhejiang first, landing in Ningbo and being stationed in eastern Zhejiang in the future. The last brigade will go directly to Wenzhou, landing and being stationed in various places under Wenzhou. In addition to separate telegrams, I am specially informing you and asking you to tell Division Commander Liu to pay attention to discipline, first carry out reorganization, streamline the establishment, and eliminate surplus personnel to enhance the army's reputation. Your brother, He Yingqin, sends his regards. (Gao Lingbai's Telegram) Telegram to Director Xiong Zemin: I have received and understood your telegram. I deeply sympathize with your illness. I hope you recover soon. I and my two brothers, Ru Xi (Liu Zhennian's courtesy name) and He Yisan, have communicated several times. Liu intends to send He to discuss the transfer matters first. I think he will arrive today or tomorrow. One transport ship has arrived, and more will arrive successively in the coming days. I am sending this telegram to inform you. Please take care. Your brother, Gao Lingbai, bows and apologizes for any omissions. (Qiu Wei's Telegram) Chairman Han, please forward this telegram to Director Xiong Zemin: I have received and understood your telegram. The ships transporting Liu's division departed from Shanghai on the 真日 (zhen ri). The 黝獅 (you shi) departed on the 文日 (wen ri), the 泰順 (tai shun) departed on the 元日 (yuan ri), the 𢌞安 (xuan an) departed on the 寒日 (han ri), and the 遇順昇安 (yu shun sheng an) totaling five ships. From 删至 (shan zhi)尚人 (shang ren) 松浦 (song pu) · 慶寗 (qing ning) · 新豐 (xin feng) · 時咈 (shi fu) · 毓濟 (yu ji) · 同華 (tong hua) · 甬興 (yong xing) seven ships departed from Shanghai successively. I am sending this telegram to inform you. Your brother, Qiu Wei, bows. Afternoon (15th)</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: In his report during the municipal government's weekly memorial service yesterday morning, Shen Honglie briefly mentioned the Jiaodong Incident, saying that the sieges of Yexian, Laiyang, and other places have now been lifted, and a dispute has been resolved. Today, he received a telegram from Chairman Han (Fuju), reporting that all troops have now completely withdrawn from the front lines to their original defenses. Yesterday, Zhao, the representative sent by Division Commander Liu (Zhennian) to discuss the transfer, came to Qingdao from Tianjin and also said that Division Commander Liu absolutely obeys the central government's order to transfer to Hubei. Yesterday, Dai Wenjun, the captain of the Chuyu warship stationed in Longkou, and Wang Yuyang, the captain of the Yongxiang warship, telegraphed, reporting that one battalion of Liu's army in Yexian had left the city to excavate the landmines buried earlier and to repair the roads and trenches in preparation for departure. This is the true picture of the transfer of Han's and Liu's armies. Since the navy took over the defenses of Yantai and Longkou, the local areas have been stable. Major cities between Yantai and Longkou, including Penglai, Fushan, and other places, have telegraphed requesting naval protection. Regarding local security matters, detachments have been sent to patrol and suppress disturbances. At the same time, the military leader stationed in Yantai has been ordered to consult with the central government representative to discuss the withdrawal routes and temporary supply and accommodation issues for Liu's division, striving to complete this task in the shortest possible time and in a very orderly manner. It is estimated that Liu's division can be completely transported away within two weeks. Once Liu's division is completely transported, the Yantai defense will be handed over to the provincial army, and all naval forces will be withdrawn to their original defenses. It is heard that He Yingqin, the Minister of Military and Political Affairs, telegraphed Shen yesterday, stating that there are many Japanese residents in Longkou and that the navy will also take over the defense and be fully responsible for maintaining security. Shen has replied by telegram to comply. The two telegrams are recorded below: (He Yingqin's Telegram) The Ministry previously received the 冬寅 (dong yin) telegram, which stipulated in the third item that the defenses of Yantai and Longkou should be maintained by the naval commander Shen, who is nearby, before the withdrawal of the Third Route Army and the arrival of the Twenty-first Division. Subsequently, it was stipulated that Yantai, with its many foreign residents, would be completely the responsibility of the navy and would no longer be handed over. I have sent separate telegrams to comply. Now, it has been found that there are also many Japanese residents in Longkou. To avoid accidents, it has also been decided that the navy will take over the defense and be fully responsible for maintaining security. In addition to telegramming Han Gong, I hope you will act accordingly. (Shen's Reply Telegram) Minister He of Nanjing: I have received and understood your telegram. Since the Liu army withdrew from Longkou to Yexian last month, no one has been responsible for local security. The navy has temporarily dispatched detachments to protect the local people. So far, they have not withdrawn. In accordance with your telegram, in addition to reporting to the Beiping Military Affairs Commission and notifying the subordinate authorities to continue stationing in Longkou to protect the local area, I am replying accordingly. Shen Honglie bows. (November 15th)</p>
<p>After the End of the Jiaodong War</p>
<p>The Provincial Army at the Front Returns to Its Original Defenses</p>
<p>Lai and Ye Counties Will Provide Emergency Relief</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Jiaodong war has been delayed for two months, and fortunately, it has been largely resolved. The withdrawal of the Third Route Army has also been largely completed, but the local area has been devastated, and post-war reorganization is urgent. I visited Han Fuju this morning to inquire about post-war measures. Han said that in terms of military affairs, the number of troops stationed will be determined based on local needs after Liu Zhennian's troops have been transferred. The issue of Commander Cao (Fulin) being stationed in Yantai will be decided at that time. In terms of politics, Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun will be sent to inspect and reorganize. The merchants and residents in the cities and towns of Laiyang and Yexian have been severely harassed by Liu's army, and many houses have been destroyed. The general public is experiencing difficulties with food, clothing, and shelter. The Provincial Relief Association has joined the Red Cross Society to provide emergency relief. At this time of cold and hardship, the provincial government will provide as much assistance as possible and plans to raise more than 10,000 yuan to benefit the disaster victims. Two ships have arrived in Yantai, and three or four more are expected to arrive today. However, there is still no definite news on when Liu's troops will depart. Liu claims that his troops number more than 25,000, so the military has prepared 13 ships. In reality, Liu's strength is only about 11,000 or 12,000. As for the provincial army's withdrawal, Ning Chunxiao's brigade has completely arrived in Jinan yesterday. Li Zhanbiao's brigade is expected to arrive completely today. Ma Guanyi's brigade will transfer from the Jiaoji Railway to the Jinpu Railway today, and will be stationed in Dezhou and the Dongchang area of western Shandong. Zhen Dexing's brigade is stationed along the Jiaoji Railway in the Zichuan and Boshan areas. Li Hanzhang's brigade is stationed in Weixian. A part of Li Xuande's cavalry brigade has returned to its original defense in Qingzhou. The 29th Division's direct subordinate troops have returned to their original defense in Zhoucun. Division Commander Cao Fulin will also return to Jinan soon. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Hengqin Island Negotiation Case in Guangdong <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Macau Portuguese Government Crosses Border to Arrest Surveyors from Zhongshan</p>
<p>Tang Shaoyi Proposes Proceeding with Sino-Portuguese Boundary Demarcation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Hengqin Island, which belongs to Zhongshan County, borders Portuguese Macau. Recently, the Zhongshan County government sent several surveyors to survey and map the area to clarify the boundaries. However, they were obstructed by local people who used foreigners as protectors. The Macau Portuguese government also surprisingly regarded the island as a leased territory and sent a Portuguese warship to arrest the surveyors from Zhongshan County and escort them to Macau for interrogation. The Zhongshan County magistrate argued strongly that the Macau Portuguese officials had crossed the border to arrest Chinese officials. Although the Macau government released the Zhongshan surveyors afterward, their mistaken belief that Hengqin Island was a leased territory actually harmed China's sovereignty. Tang Shaoyi reported this matter to the Southwest Political Council during his visit to the province last week and consulted the Sino-Portuguese treaty with the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Municipal Government as a basis for protest. On the one hand, he planned to submit a detailed report of the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the Portuguese envoy. Yesterday, Zhu Zhaoshen, the diplomatic inspector of the five southwestern provinces, also expressed the following opinions on this case: [1. Although the Sino-Portuguese treaty of 1888 did not clearly demarcate the boundary line between the two Hengqin islands, it can be recognized that they are undoubtedly Chinese land. Gao Erqian, the boundary demarcation minister at the end of the Qing Dynasty, did not demarcate the area either. The Macau side has provided military equipment to the islands, helped the people defend against pirates, and funded schools. Some people suspect that they intend to encroach, but according to the Portuguese consul's explanation to me, there is absolutely no intention of encroaching. I also believe that they dare not encroach because Macau is adjacent to us and should adopt a peaceful and friendly policy to coexist peacefully. I advise them to demarcate a temporary boundary line on the spot with the veteran diplomat Mr. Tang Shaoyi as soon as possible to clarify Hengqin and the territorial waters to avoid further misunderstandings. In the future, the Nanjing government will send a designated boundary demarcation commissioner to formally demarcate the boundary with the Portuguese government. I wonder if the Macau government can proceed accordingly.] After this case occurred, the foreign affairs associations of the southwestern provinces also convened a meeting on the ninth of this month to discuss countermeasures. As a result, it was decided to telegraph the central government to resolve the issue according to law. The telegram was sent out on the twelfth as follows: The Zhongshan County government, in order to clarify the boundary line due to the Macau government's intention to occupy Hengqin Island, which belongs to the county, and the repeated occurrence of cases in the Macau leased area, specially sent surveyors to survey the area near Hengqin Township and the boundary between Macau. The Macau government detained the surveyors on a warship, conducted its own interrogation, and requested the Zhongshan County magistrate to attend the trial. The County magistrate ignored it, and the Macau government sent the surveyors back. After reading it, I was very angry. If we do not argue according to reason, the consequences will be disastrous. I hope that the central government will quickly order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to resolve the issue according to law to protect the national sovereignty and consolidate our defenses.] (November 14th)</p>

<p>Bank Robbers Go to Shanghai to Be Arrested: When the China Industrial Bank came to Songjiang to open a branch in June, it was robbed by five or six bandits armed with weapons in broad daylight before a month had passed. They opened the vault door and robbed more than 13,000 yuan. The pursuit by land and water on the same day failed to catch them. The County Public Security Bureau sent detectives to investigate, but there was no progress. The county government was punished by the provincial authorities and ordered to investigate strictly within a limited time. Yesterday, Dong Ruitang, the chief of political police of the county government, received a letter from the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Corps, stating that according to informants, the robbers of the Songjiang branch of the Xingye Bank had been arrested. Six suspects, including Niushe, Guo Li Yingmu, Zheng Shaobo, Sun Hanzheng, and Xiao Shao, were detained in Shanghai. Yang Shijie, an inspector of the County Public Security Bureau, also received the same information. He went to Shanghai that night to investigate and returned to Songjiang to report to the County Public Security Bureau. The county government has prepared the official documents for the arrest and sent Inspector Yang to Shanghai to bring them back for investigation.</p>

However, the key witness in the case, Ling Ma, a wet nurse of the Zhang family, has been repeatedly summoned by the procuratorate without success, and it is feared that she may be missing. The Zhang family is still searching for Ling Ma's whereabouts. It is now learned that Ling Ma is working as a domestic servant in Shanghai and can be brought to justice. Yesterday, the plaintiff, Jiang, filed a petition with the court clarifying everything. It is heard that the next court hearing will be at 9:00 am on the 25th of this month, and Zhang Baopei, a lawyer, has been appointed by the court as the defense lawyer for the suspect.</p>

<p>In order to prevent bandits and maintain治安安, a water and land inspection office has been established during the winter defense period. Li Zhicheng, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, has been appointed as the director, and Li Tianmin, a former official of the Songjiang Salt Police Bureau, has been appointed as the deputy director. It was officially established yesterday at the Sanwu Hall in Qigan Alley, Nanqiao. The regulations are as follows: (1) The office is organized by the Public Security Bureau, the Police Force, the Defense Corps, and the Water Police Force, and each will send two officers to jointly perform duties. Each district will also set up a district inspection office with the district chief as the director. If there is no police force or water police force stationed in the district, the Public Security Bureau and the Defense Corps will perform the duties. The inspection sites are 16 waterways, including Nanqiao, Fengcheng Qingcungang, Zhuanghang, etc., and four land routes, including Tuolin, Tang, Zhoujialong, etc. Inspectors will wear badges to inspect separately. If prohibited items or persons with suspicious behavior are found on vehicles or ships, they may be detained at any time and handed over to the local office for transfer to the headquarters for interrogation. (2) All inspectors will receive their original salaries, but will be given a night snack allowance for the evening. Those who have made outstanding contributions to solving major cases or who have been found to be shielding malfeasance by the responsible officers or reported by others will be rewarded or punished accordingly.</p>

<p>Opposition to the Establishment of a Nitric Acid Plant: Shiyong Town in the 14th district of the county is surrounded by mountains on the west, north, and south, separated by a giant river, commonly known as Shanmenkou, with excellent terrain. In 1920, the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs sent personnel to survey the Shanwan and establish a Hengchun. Due to an incident it was halted. Last month, the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs planned to open a nitrate plant and sent personnel to survey the mountain again. The mountain is near Taihu Lake, and although the bay is remote, transportation is convenient. It was decided to set up a factory in Tanwan.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this news, Zhang Juchu, Shao Shutang, and more than 60 other citizens of the area, because there are more than 300 households in the village and dense populations in the neighboring villages and alleys, and the mountains are densely populated with tombs, with about 20,000 tombs. If the nitrate plant is realized, the more than 20,000 tombs will be destroyed. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, requesting that the nitrate plant be relocated to preserve the tombs and ensure the safety of the ancestors.</p>

<p>Jin Wanxing, Chen Fuxing, and other cattle slaughtering companies in Xiyi jointly petitioned the central and provincial governments with counterparts from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Suzhou, and other counties last month, requesting permission to slaughter vegetables cattle to maintain their business. After receiving the petition, the provincial government considered that cattle are of great importance to agriculture, and it is difficult to distinguish between cattle and vegetable cattle. It specifically ordered the Department of Industry to investigate and report, and before the investigation and report is completed, the slaughter should still be prohibited and no tricks should be allowed. Recently, however, the market is flooded with beef, and the loss of farming cattle in various villages has become increasingly common. Therefore, the village chiefs and district chiefs believe that the private slaughter of farming cattle is strictly prohibited, and the prohibition has not yet been lifted, but the loss of farming cattle is already high. The cattle merchants are using tricks. If the slaughter is allowed, the impact on agriculture will be even greater. Yesterday, they petitioned the county to request a prohibition on the slaughter to maintain agricultural production.</p>
<p>[Planning the Establishment of a Blind Relief Department]</p>
<p>The county party department held its third party-government meeting at 2:00 pm yesterday. The chairman, Xu Yongyi, decided on the following important cases: (1) The business of divination and astrology has been expressly banned. The county relief institute should be requested to set up a blind relief department to accommodate blind people to make a living. (2) The County Education Association intends to request the County Party Department to jointly organize an Education Funding Reorganization Committee with the County Government, the Finance Bureau, the Property Department, the Education Bureau, and the Education Association to reorganize the accumulated education funding over the years and should forward it to the Education Bureau for review and reply. (3) Since the suspension of the Laogong First School, a huge amount of money has been in arrears. It is proposed to liquidate the new school facilities and discuss with County Chief Li and Commissioner Li to handle the matter. (4) The County Public Security Bureau should ban Chen Cici, the owner of the Deyuexuan store, from building illegal hot water stoves. (5) The County Public Security Bureau should earnestly persuade the end of welcoming gods and holding festivals.</p>

<p>Shu Shifu, the director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, previously obtained approval from the provincial government to issue an order to all counties to uniformly organize promotion and collection offices. All house and land sales and transfers are to be officially collected and officially removed by the promotion and collection offices, and official stamped receipts are to be issued as practice certificates. After Director Wang of the County Finance Bureau received the order, he immediately complied and established it, appointing Section Chief Lu Dingxin as the director. The district clerks, after hearing about it, believed that their livelihoods would be cut off, and they repeatedly held meetings and decided to elect a representative to petition Director Wang to make a flexible arrangement. Director Wang said that the order from the Department of Finance was difficult to violate and did not agree to the change. In order to take care of both parties, sixteen people were selected from the district clerks to work in the office, and an order was issued to the district clerks to make a list for rice rations, etc. All fees were abolished, and the households went to the office to register, officially collected and officially removed, and official stamped receipts were issued as practice certificates. The promotion and collection fee was 45 cents per 100 yuan. The district clerks were not allowed to collect the promotion and collection fee again. After learning about this, the district clerks expressed dissatisfaction and still wanted to find a way to request relief. I wonder if they can achieve their goal.</p>

(2) Expel wandering soldiers and scattered bandits from the territory. (3) River and sea escort will be jointly run by officials and merchants. Representatives will be sent to Shanghai to discuss the plan with the shipping companies.</p>
<p>The County Government Requests Instructions on Confiscating Public Beach Fields: The Ministry of Finance and the Provincial Government ruled that the representative of the Liuhaisha Dingxing case, Xu Xiaoxian, over-collected 1,500 acres of beach fields for public use and put the income into the national treasury, and ordered the Nantong County Government to implement it. Because Xu Xiaoxian is currently being detained by the court for another case, and several letters have not been followed, County Chief Zhang specially submitted a request to the Provincial Government for instructions.

<h3 id="e97">Reasons for the Deficit of the American Ball Factory <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Yuchun, the owner of the American Ball Knitting Factory at Shizhu Bridge in the city of the two ports, started the factory with only 4,000 yuan of capital in the fifth year of the Republic of China. Later, because Mr. Zhao was diligent and hardworking in management, he gradually added new machines and expanded the factory buildings. The number of workers increased to more than a thousand. Now, it has almost become one of the largest factories in Yibu. The financial industry, seeing the factory's large scale, had successively extended loans to Mr. Zhao. Zhao then used these funds to develop business in various places, such as the wholesale outlets in Hankou, and the Rusheng Factory in Lujiabu, etc. Unexpectedly, due to the unstable situation and excessive inventory, all the branches and sub-factories suffered huge losses. Accumulated to date, the debt owed has reached more than 600,000 yuan. The financial industry yesterday convened a meeting of all creditors of the factory at the industry guild hall to discuss the results. Before a maintenance plan is available, two creditor representatives will be appointed to monitor the factory starting today (the 17th) and temporarily suspend incoming goods. According to the person in charge of the factory, the reason for the current funding problems is that the losses of the branch factories and outlets were too great, resulting in a strain on the entire factory. Upon investigation, the total current inventory of the factory is 200,000 yuan, accounts receivable in the Yangtze River area are 100,000 yuan, production machinery is valued at 150,000 yuan, the Hankou wholesale outlet has an inventory of 130,000 yuan, and all the production equipment of the Jiangdong Dyeing Factory is valued at 20,000 yuan. The factory building is worth 20,000 yuan, totaling more than 600,000 yuan, which is sufficient to offset the losses. If the financial industry provides maintenance, there is hope for restoring the original state.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Ministry of Education Promulgates Curriculum Standards for Kindergartens and Elementary Schools (1) <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Curriculum Standards for Kindergartens and Elementary Schools</p>
<p>Drafting Process</p>
<p>The curriculum standards for kindergartens and elementary schools were drafted by the Ministry of Education, which appointed experts and organized a committee to take charge. The process lasted from October of the 17th year to October of the 21st year, going through the following four stages before completion:</p>
<p>First Stage: Drafting and Compilation. The Ministry of Education appointed various experts and organized a drafting committee for curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools. Starting in October of the 17th year, those with expertise in various subjects of kindergartens and elementary schools were assigned to be responsible for drafting, compiling, reviewing, and revising. By August of the 18th year, the drafting and compilation were completed. The Ministry of Education ordered the provinces and cities to use them as temporary standards for trial implementation. The following gentlemen contributed to the work during this period...</p>
<p>Temporary Standards for Kindergarten Curriculum (in order of number of strokes in surname)</p>
<p>Gan Mengdan, Wu Yanren, Jin Haiguan, Hu Shuyi, Yu Ziyi, Ma Ketan, Zhang Zonglin, Chen Heqin, Ge Liting, Yang Baokang, Jiang Xicen. Temporary Standards for Elementary School Curriculum</p>

Second Stage: Trial and Research. The Ministry of Education instructed the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to organize research societies and designate schools to conduct trials and research, setting a deadline of June of the 19th year to submit opinions to the Ministry for reference. Subsequently, various provinces and cities followed the order for trial research. However, by July of the 19th year, no opinions had been submitted to the Ministry by the provinces and cities, and there were requests to extend the trial research period. Consequently, the Ministry issued a general order to extend the trial research period for one year, setting a deadline of June of the 20th year to submit the results to the Ministry for record. By June of the 20th year, the results of the trial research were reported to the Ministry by the following regions: Zhejiang Provincial Education Department, Jiangsu Provincial Education Department, Nanjing Municipal Education Bureau, Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, Guangdong Provincial Education Department, Rehe Provincial Education Department, Education Bureau of Huadian County, Jilin Province. In addition, various experimental elementary schools in Jiangsu Province also submitted many opinions. The Zhejiang Provincial Education Department also submitted detailed reports of the trial results of its affiliated schools, with numerous opinions.</p>
<p>Third Stage: Revision and Correction. [Since] it was necessary to change the original drafting committee for curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools, the Ministry of Education appointed experts in the 20th year to reorganize it into a committee for drafting curriculum and equipment standards for primary and secondary schools. It was engaged in collecting opinions from all parties, studying and revising. It was estimated that from June 18th, there were two days of meetings and preliminary review and revision committees. The standards for kindergartens and elementary schools were largely determined, and the unfinished work was assigned to various personnel. On September 20th and 21st, there were two more days of general meetings and review meetings. Various standards were discussed and decided, and handed over to the standing committee for consolidation. The following committee members were scheduled to do their best in this period: Wang Jinxin, Jiang Jing Shuang, Zhu Wenshu, Zhu Baoqin, Wu Yanren, Shen Baiying, Shen Leilian, Li Qingsong, Li Xiaonong, Yi Ke, Lin Duanfu, Hu Shuyi, Hu Yanli, Shi Renfu, Yu Ziyi, Ma Ketan, Ni Zhuhua, Xu Yiqiao, Weng Zhida, Chen Heqin, Zhang Guoren, Peng Baichuan, Zhao Naichuan, Zhao Tingwei, Jiang Xicen, Zheng Hesheng, Xue Dahan, Dai Yingguan, Xie Shuying, Wei Bingxin, Luo Dixian, Gu Shusen. In addition, the following gentlemen participated in the discussion of research issues for various subjects: (Social Studies) Zhao Zhengduo, Jiang Ziqi, (Music) Wang Yungong, Tang Xueyong, Xiao Youmei.</p>
<p>The revision of the standards this time, except for the kindergarten curriculum standards, which have very few changes, the differences between the elementary school curriculum standards and the temporary standards are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) [Party Doctrine] is not set up as a separate subject, and the Party Doctrine teaching materials are fully integrated into the subjects of [Chinese Language], [Social Studies], and [Natural Science]. (2) The hygiene part of the [Social Studies] and [Natural Science] subjects of the temporary standards is separated, and a separate [Hygiene] subject curriculum standard is formulated. (3) The [Work] subject is changed to [Labor], and the commercial information part is deleted, and the commercial information valuation operation is incorporated into the [Arithmetic] and other subjects. (4) [Citizenship] teaching materials are added to the [Social Studies] subject and [the content is revised]. (5) The contents and wording of each subject have been revised. (6) A separate [general outline] is set to be the crown of each subject standard.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Fourth Stage: Compilation Completed <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>After the revision and correction in the third phase, it could have been promulgated, but unfortunately, the Minister and Vice Minister had not completed the review. Then the September 18th Incident occurred, and the standards had to be temporarily put aside. This year, after Minister Zhu arrived at the Ministry, he felt that the curriculum standards were important and needed to be reorganized and compiled. Therefore, he re-appointed members to review and revise them. From August 1st to August 5th, there were five general meetings in total, and the standards were compiled. Later, Minister Zhu felt that the elementary school Chinese curriculum standards were especially important, so he hired literary experts to review them in detail. From September 26th, there were two days of meetings to further refine the elementary school Chinese curriculum standards (the distribution table of teaching materials was drafted during this review). The elementary school civics training standards only had one case for reform during the general meeting in August. After sorting, it was distributed to various committee members for review. On October 6th, the committee members in Beijing were gathered to hold a meeting for discussion. There were two days of meetings, and the standards were largely completed. The following gentlemen contributed to the work during this period:</p>
<p>(Those who participated in all curriculum standards) Wang Jinxin, Wu Yanren, Gu Qingsong, Yi Kezhong, Hu Liyan, Hu Shuyi, Shi Renfu, Xu Suen, Ma Ketan, Chen Heqin, Jiang Xicen, Xue Tianhan, Gu Shusen. (Those who reviewed the elementary school Chinese curriculum standards) Zhou Yutong, Xia Zeng, Zhao Jingshen, Gu Junzheng, Gu Shusen. (Those who participated in the elementary school civics training standards) (In addition to the committee members in Beijing) Wang Wan, Shen Zishan.</p>
<p>The differences between the standards this time and the previous ones are:</p>
<p>1.  An increase in civics training standards, which are the standards for moral education in elementary schools. Because elementary schools do not have separate subjects for civics or self-cultivation, etc., regarding moral training subjects, this standard is added as the basis for civics training.</p>
<p>2.  The deletion of the minimum graduation requirements. Because some of the original minimum graduation requirements were not specific, and some were too subjective, it was advocated to temporarily delete them. In the future, after the development of standard testing or a performance chart, more objective limits will be set separately. After the completion of the payment standard, it will be sent to the Minister for review, and the Minister and Vice Minister will carefully modify it once. Although it cannot be said that it is without flaws, it was drafted and revised by more than one hundred people, tested and researched in various parts of the country, and took four years. It was only completed after research and discussion by many committee members. It can also be regarded as the most important work in the field of elementary education in recent years. However, the curriculum should be continuously improved. It is hoped that the education community across the country will study together with a view to re-compiling a more complete curriculum standard after several years of implementation. Standing Committee of the Curriculum and Equipment Standards Compilation Committee of the Ministry of Education for Primary and Secondary Schools, recorded on 21.10.20.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Implementation Measures for Kindergarten and Elementary School Curriculum Standards <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>1.  After the promulgation of these standards, all elementary schools in the country should immediately follow them for implementation. However, experimental elementary schools approved by the Ministry of Education or those that have been approved by the competent educational administrative organs due to special local circumstances may make appropriate changes in implementation.</p>
<p>2.  If local areas have any opinions on these standards, they should report them to the Ministry of Education at any time as reference material for revision.</p>
<p>3.  If the implementation of these standards in various provinces is hampered due to a lack of teachers, the teacher training education should be improved immediately, and the existing elementary school teachers should be given opportunities for further study and research. For example: (1) During vacations or evening spare time, the local educational administrative organs should convene teachers from various schools who are responsible for a certain subject to provide them with basic knowledge and skills about a certain subject and teach them teaching methods. (2) Elementary school teachers should organize research groups on a certain subject to study and practice the knowledge, war, and skills of a certain subject.</p>
<p>4.  After the promulgation of these standards, the Ministry of Education will designate several provinces and municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan and the Education Bureau to first invite experts and field researchers to organize a curriculum revision committee. Based on these standards, the operation items for each subject and each academic year will be compiled into specific teaching material outlines, and the achievement limits for each academic year will be attached. After the teaching examples are submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval, they will be implemented in the province and city, and the Ministry of Education will order the provinces and cities to study these examples and compile specific courses for submission to the Ministry of Education for record and implementation.</p>
<p>5.  After the promulgation of these standards, the local educational bureaus and departments of various counties and cities will organize local teaching material collection committees in order to supplement local teaching materials. Based on these standards, the operation items of each subject will collect local practical rural teaching materials as supplementary teaching materials and submit them to the competent educational administrative organs for review. After verification, it is added to the specific teaching material outline.</p>
<p>6.  The operation items of each subject and each school year of these standards are all arranged using the [setting method], so they often take the subject as the foundation and form a self-contained system. The curriculum is compiled. Please edit the courses according to the season and the psychological arrangement method and organize the necessary teaching materials into mutually connected units. 7. The curriculum should be compiled by each province and city in accordance with the [nature] contained in the standard to determine the complete and simple two types or more than two, so that schools in cities and villages or schools that are well-run and not well-run can follow it.</p>
<p>7.  The curriculum of overseas Chinese elementary schools in Nanyang and other places should be compiled separately by local overseas Chinese education administrators and orchid overseas Chinese education associations and orchid overseas Chinese school representatives based on these standards and local conditions, and submitted to the Ministry of Education for review and record (to be continued).</p>

<p>Sunday to Hold Full-Distance Practice</p>
<p>The International Race has been scheduled for the 4th of next month. With the date rapidly approaching, the Chinese team must prepare. In addition to veteran runners like Shi Jinsheng and Zhou Yu Yu, there are also champions from the previous open races. With such abundant talent, any deficiencies can be easily compensated for, and there is optimism about our strength. It is expected that the number of participants in the International Race will not be fewer than last year. However, according to the committee, this year's competition requires participants to be at least eighteen years old, and the wearing of rubber shoes is prohibited. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to participate. Therefore, young Chinese athletes like Wang Mengmao will definitely not participate this time. As for wearing rubber shoes, the Chinese team does not advocate it, and only a few individuals have done so. It is reported that the China Athletic Association has notified all racers to switch to racing shoes and has scheduled a seventeen-mile full-distance practice for the day after tomorrow (Sunday). Participants can gather at the intersection of Tongfu Road at 7:30 AM that day. The association will still provide a carriage to follow.</p>
<p>It is also reported that to encourage participants in the open races, the association has already provided prizes for the top fifteen finishers. From the sixteenth to the fortieth place, a pair of racing socks donated by Mr. Ge Zhonggao will be awarded. These can be claimed from the association at Er'ertang on Tibet Road, starting immediately.</p>

<p>Liangjiang Wins Over Dongya (A) ... 59 to 13</p>
<p>丨Two Games Tonight, One in Group A and One in Group B丨</p>
<p>There are very few Chinese women's basketball teams. As a result, Liangjiang (B) won over Shanghai Middle School 34-10, and Chongde won over Nanyang 42-15. In Group A, Liangjiang won over Dongya 59-13.</p>
<p>Judging from the games, the first two games in Group B were not exciting at all, and the skills of the players were not up to par. Comparatively speaking, Zhu Hexiu of Liangjiang and Wang Xiangying of Chongde were more outstanding. In the Group A game, Liangjiang dominated Dongya. However, Liangjiang's performance was particularly impressive. Every player was strong, energetic, skilled, and had excellent coordination. Their passing and shooting were no less than that of men. On the Dongya side, only Qian Hangsu was relatively active, but unfortunately, she lacked partners and could not maximize her potential. The scores of each group are listed below:</p>

<p>Furthermore, the new rules for women's basketball have already been announced. However, for the sake of clarity for all teams, they are re-announced as follows. Please pay attention: ㈠ The radius of the free-throw circle is three feet (originally two feet). ㈡ When holding the ball during a free throw, waiting for more than ten seconds will be considered a violation (previously, it was a technical foul). ㈢ Legal defense is not limited to a vertical plane, as long as there is no body contact or other technical or personal foul. ㈣ During a two-man jump ball, the jumpers should each stand in the semicircle closer to their own basket (i.e., facing away from their own basket) for the jump ball. ㈤ All successful shots are worth two points. ㈥ If a player is fouled while shooting, and the shot is successful, it will be counted as valid, and the player will be awarded one free throw. If the shot is unsuccessful, the player will be awarded two free throws.</p>

<p>丨50 to 31丨</p>
<p>Group B: Muer Wins Over Junior High 67 to 19</p>
<p>丨Three Games Tonight丨</p>
<p>The Xiqing Basketball Association opened its tournament last night. Due to a change in the order, only five games were played in Group A. Xiaguang defeated the U.S. Navy's Los Angeles Destroyer by a score of 50 to 31. In Group B, Muer (MM) won over Junior High by a score of 67 to 19. The first half ended with a score of 32 to 14 in favor of Xiaguang. The course of Xiaguang's victory is as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The game was dull at the beginning. In the first half, the U.S. Navy's center, Russell, scored two consecutive shots, and Guan An made one free throw. The Navy took an early lead of 4 to 1. Xiaguang worked hard to catch up and took the lead with a score of 5 to 4. Then the two teams were evenly matched, tying three times. The game was dull because neither side made much progress. Xiaguang's teamwork was lacking, and they relied on individual efforts, which were not very effective. The Navy's shooting was inaccurate, and they ran around without much to show for it. This situation did not change until the score was tied at 10 to 10, when the game finally opened up and showed new developments.</p>
<p>▲ Starting to work together and take the initiative, the effectiveness greatly increased. The three forwards, flowing smoothly, successively scored into the net with ease. The playing style became more organized. They scored 23 points in a row. Looking back at the Navy's performance, it declined rapidly and was beyond repair. Even with repeated substitutions, they did not add a single point. The first half ended with a score of 33 to 10. The situation in the second half remained the same. Although the Navy showed some improvement, it was not enough to change the overall outcome. Xiaguang, having been too aggressive in the first half, gradually showed signs of fatigue, giving the Navy few opportunities to score. The final score was 50 to 31. ▲ The Navy's second-string team's second half was the most exciting part of the game and was also Xiaguang's most triumphant moment. Their teamwork was so smooth that every shot was accurate, which was very impressive. Xiaguang's great victory was somewhat aided by luck. As for the Navy, although they were physically strong, their skills seemed rusty, and their movements were fast but their aim was poor. Their shooting lacked accuracy, and their coordination was often chaotic. They were really just a second-rate team.</p>

<p>Donghua Attacks Without Being Pushy</p>
<p>St. John's Has a Good Fighting Spirit</p>
<p>Donghua played a friendly match with the St. John's University team yesterday at the St. John's field. The crowd was huge, with about 3,000 spectators. The soccer fans in western Shanghai were in for a real treat. Donghua's lineup changed dramatically yesterday. Li Yichen and a strong center back were moved to defense. Li Yichen filled in for You Yichen. Feng Yunyou accompanied the team but did not play. In the second half, Li Ning also took on a managerial role. Yang Renwei returned to the right wing and performed well, which was definitely better than his previous position as a midfielder. Right-back Yin Zhengda also had few weaknesses and made few mistakes, and he was more agile than in the match against the British Navy. On the St. John's side, Wu Youliang led the team, running and assisting without any flaws. Center forward Pang Panfang, right forward Luo Chunren, and inside midfielders Chen and Wu were all promising talents. Overall, St. John's fighting spirit was really good, but unfortunately, their forwards were too slow, and they repeatedly missed good opportunities. Otherwise, they would not have been completely defeated.</p>
<p>Li Silian blew the whistle, and the two teams began a fierce battle. After dozens of exchanges, it was hard to tell who was ahead. Li Yichen saved the ball from a chaotic situation and passed it to Yang Zuo Waner. After some exchanging, he passed to Hong Guang, who dribbled into the penalty area and scored a goal. After St. John's conceded a goal, they launched a major counterattack. Wu Youliang commanded the game, and the whole team worked hard. Pang Panfang made a deep solo run, but he was too far from the goal and had to retreat. He fell down. Pang shot at the goal, but the ball bounced back off the post. The goal was saved. During a chaotic moment, Tu Kaiyuan made a long pass, which Wu Youlin received. Cao Qiuting escaped, bypassed the dragon, and went to intercept the ball. Youlin was unable to dribble. Cao got the ball and shot directly at the goal, scoring another goal. Shortly after, it was lemon time, and they took a group photo to show their camaraderie. When the game resumed, St. John's forwards attacked aggressively several times, but they all failed. Soon, Li Ning made a long drive. Hong Guang dribbled the ball quickly, but he was blocked by Lin Ri. He made a short pass to Renwei, who went to the end line. He was forced into a corner kick by Youlin. Yang Renwei took the kick. The ball fell precisely, only a short distance from the goal. Chen Jiaqiu stepped up and scored another goal. Later, Chen Hongguang scored another goal, and the game ended. ▲ Donghua Team</p>

<p>The director of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council suggested purchasing 3 mu, 6 fen, and 5 li of land near the New East District Elementary School to increase the playground. The Education Committee discussed it, and the Commissioner of Public Works stated that the school and the neighboring Nie Zhongcheng Public School already occupied more than 25 mu of land. Since the land price was too expensive and the school was not a boarding school, there was no need to expand the area any further. The fence built by the contractor would be removed after the work was completed, so the playground would not be divided. The Acting Superintendent of Schools also believed that the existing playground area was sufficient for the needs of both schools and should be jointly used by them through consultation. The committee approved this proposal, and the board of directors approved it as well.</p>

<p>丨For the Brave Soldiers in the Northeast丨</p>
<p>With their own conscience, the compatriots in Jiangnan must also think about the brave soldiers in the Northeast who are fighting desperately! In the piercingly cold winter, we always ask our friends, "Are you cold?" But are the brave soldiers in the Northeast, who are in the freezing weather, cold? The country belongs to all our compatriots. The brave soldiers are fighting for the country, which means they are fighting for the status of all our compatriots.</p>
<p>The male and female students of various schools in Suzhou, with their own consciences, spent their precious time studying, and spread out in various directions to earnestly solicit donations. The girls' performance was very good. There were traces of the girls in various key areas, various institutions, and various households. Their efforts to solicit donations are worthy of people's praise! With earnest words and a sincere heart, they described the hardships and courage of the brave soldiers in the Northeast, which moved people. Compatriots! If you are not generous in donating, you may have a heart of stone!</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to Guanqian for something. From Yangyu Lane to Cufang Bridge, I donated more than 20 cents for the brave soldiers back and forth. Every time the car passed in front of the students, it was stopped and donated two cents. When I got out of the car at Yangyu Lane, I saw the driver voluntarily donated two cents of his hard-earned money.</p>
<p>Alas! What an admirable driver!</p>
<p>I wish the sisters and brothers in the amusement field! And the compatriots with ample money! Spend a few cents as you wish! Do not destroy your conscience.</p>

<p>It is said that there was a story that vaguely symbolizes the characteristics of the nation... Once, representatives from various countries gathered together and each wrote an article about elephants. The British title was "Elephant Hunting under British Rule," the French title was "The Elephant and His Lover," the German title was "Introduction to Elephantology," the Polish title was "Elephants and the Polish Question," and the American title was "How to Hunt Big and Good Elephants." The Russian title was "Do Elephants Exist in the World?" I think if there were representatives from Great China attending this gathering, his title would probably be "How to Resist Elephants?" Otherwise, he might write a "Fighting Elephants" article!</p>
<p>Do not be stingy and refuse to donate a cent, and know that you are also a member of the country.</p>

<p>丨Beard Three Feet Long, Sweeping the Ground When Sitting, Passing the Knees When Standing丨</p>
<p>There are very few long-lived people in China these days. A man named Ruan from Penglai County, Shandong, who is now in the three northeastern provinces, said that he is 148 years old. There is also a man named Li who is over 100 years old. His portrait has been published in various newspapers. Now there is another elderly man, Zhang Zaifeng, who is from Yingzhou, northern Anhui, and is 109 years old. He was born in the Jia Shen year of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty. He has an extraordinary appearance that is astonishing. The beard on his chin is visible at the root, more than three feet long, and when sitting on a chair, the beard sweeps the ground, which is twice as long as that of Marquis Shou of the Han Dynasty. According to him, after eating immortal peaches, his face became younger, and his beard grew wildly. After carefully inquiring about his secret to longevity, it is nothing more than having few desires and a pure heart. During the Red Sheep Tribulation, he met an immortal who taught him the method of refining elixirs and collecting herbs, which is why he has such longevity.</p>
<p>He cultivated himself in Little Lotus Mountain, but was disturbed by the communists and could no longer live there, so he returned to his hometown. His relatives and old friends have all died, so he had to live in the home of a gentleman surnamed Li. Through the introduction of a friend, he came to Shanghai specifically to form a relationship with a group of pious men and women. He will meet with you in the Great World in a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e131">An Offensive Against Love Films <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Da</p>
<p>In recent years, the development of the film industry, both Chinese and foreign, has truly progressed at a tremendous pace. However, among the large number of productions, it is rare to find a film that does not talk about love, which shows the needs of today's society. At the same time, it occurs to me that there must be many young people whose will has been corrupted, indirectly influenced by these love films.</p>
<p>Young people talking about love is an inevitable psychological trend and a normal phenomenon. However, their pursuit is often based on improper means and blind understanding, resulting in tragedies in society, creating an atmosphere where the country and friends can be forsaken, but not the lover.</p>
<p>In many universities, these facts are especially visible: meeting today and talking about love tomorrow.</p>
<p>If the other party is beautiful and behaves romantically, it can create a lot of jokes, with many hues and colors.</p>
<p>The other day, I watched the new film "Adorable Enemies" by Star Film Company, which gave me a great feeling. The plot of this film briefly describes how college student Xu Yuanlu fell in love with a romantic female classmate, resulting in breaking off relations with his friend Zhao Youcheng. However, Zhao Youcheng spared no sacrifice to persuade him, and [reason overcame emotion], finally awakening Xu Yuanlu.</p>
<p>This film, on the one hand, indicates that friendship is the most precious, and on the other hand, it corrects the concept of love for ordinary college students. In today's market saturated with love films, it is undoubtedly a valuable contribution to suddenly discover such a production that attacks all boring love films.</p>

<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis with hemoptysis is the most difficult disease to diagnose and treat. It has been rumored for a long time at the Chunming Pharmaceutical School on Xueshi Street in Suzhou. The owner, Mr. Huang, had an ancestor who, during the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, fled to other places. He met a Mr. Tang who was poor and sick with no place to go. Mr. Huang took pity on him and allowed him to live in a corner, treating him like family. After things calmed down and he returned to Suzhou, Mr. Tang still followed him and eventually died of old age. Before his death, he passed on a secret recipe to Mr. Huang.</p>

<p>Five Also Has a Love Character</p>
<p>On the Jiangmian River in Xiaguan, the Japanese warships anchored there fired several blank shots for no reason, presenting a terrifying phenomenon. The most laughable and contradictory fact was that some people living in Xiaguan were taking their old and young and running to the city in a panic, while at the same time, some people living in the city were carrying boxes and bedding and running out of the city. Han Muliang received the bad news from the ×× department the earliest, so he left the fastest and had already resolved to jump on the train and return directly to his old home in Suzhou before finally stopping to catch his breath.</p>
<p>What he regretted was not the shattering of his rice bowl, but the departure of his vase. He was expressing his feelings to a female comrade and had not yet reached fruition when he was disrupted by the blank shots.</p>
<p>The terror in Xiaguan flowed eastward, and the tension in Shanghai surged westward, converging in the human paradise of Suzhou. The timidity of Suzhou people, like the braised pork of Lu Gaojian, is famous far and wide. Moreover, this invasion by Japanese pirates is not comparable to the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. Planes with the sun emblem come to circle every day. Muliang barely ate a bowl of porridge after the planes went away, and as usual, he lay on the sofa, dazed. The radio continuously reported: "[Several Japanese warships have arrived at the Huishan Wharf, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers and officers.]" His relatives and friends came one after another to say:</p>
<p>"[We are leaving.]" Muliang said to his wife:</p>
<p>"[Let's go too.]"</p>
<p>The young mistress Han naturally did not object to leaving, but where to go was a question. Muliang thought that if they were to leave, they had to go to Shanghai. There were robbers in the villages and towns, so the foreign concessions in Shanghai were a protective charm. Therefore, he finally "[took his family and other dependents on a local steamer to Shanghai and sent a telegram to his godfather, asking for a long vacation from the ×× department."</p>
<p>Although the concessions in Shanghai also heard cannon fire every minute or two and saw the red flames in the northern suburbs, and although they saw trucks full of Japanese soldiers speeding across the streets, there were still wire fences and sandbags separating them into another world, where various entertainments and supplies of food and sex were still available. In the autumn of 1894-95, he lived in the concessions, not caring about anything, and went to the Great World at night to guess riddles. Now, guessing riddles is no longer fashionable, and he feels that he has lost a boring pastime. He happened to meet a colleague from the ×× department, who led him to the Parisian Dance Hall when they talked about these days' lives.</p>
<p>At first, he didn't find it very interesting, but after doing a few dances, he gradually became fascinated and went every night. He had no purpose, so he casually pulled a dancer in the dance hall and, with the decadent music, embraced her in the drunken-like lights and danced. The dancers, apart from the differences in the length, fatness, and thinness of their bodies, had bare breasts pressed against you, smooth jade arms pulling you, rounded powder legs resisting you, the fragrance of powder intoxicating you, the dreamy soft words tempting you, and the drowsy starry eyes teasing you. Each had these innate abilities, and it was difficult to distinguish a high or low level. In short, after being intoxicated, the appearance was secondary.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Gold Market Stably Firm <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲A jump of three taels eight qian. Yesterday's gold price tended to be firm and beneficial, but changes were still minimal. Throughout the day, the difference was only two taels and two qian. Overall, it has risen by about four taels, but trading is sparse because many of the December transactions have not been properly settled, hence major players are taking a wait-and-see approach. Initially, because the silver market was falling sharply and the exchange rates of British and American currencies continued to decline, it immediately exceeded the 750 tael mark. Afterwards, there were at most two rises and falls. Regarding the different trends of British currency being stable and American currency being tight, the market outlook is stable, and over-the-counter trading is particularly sluggish, with price differences of less than one tael. All December to January term trades, now Bingxing shorted 175 contracts to Qianchangxiang and others, still with the multiple side offering 6 taels and 2 qian. Senchangbing shorted over 100 contracts to Hengyu, with a discount of 6 taels. In the afternoon, Bingxing again shorted 370 to 80 contracts to Fuchang, with a discount of 6 taels and 8 qian. However, the multiple side, Yingfeng Heng and Senchang Yong completed over 400 transactions, with a discount of 6 taels and 3 qian. Now, the summary of the overall market is recorded below:</p>

Moreover, Dachencheng Hengyu Qianchangxiang Fuxingyong and others advanced, adding up to 1 tael and a half. Yuanheng Hengchang Yonglai sold, and the US dollar in December could be settled at 6.875, the British pound in November at 19 and a half, should retreat to 50 taels and a half. Then it returned to a high of two taels zero, because the December US dollar was doing 6.875, November 6.25. Bingxing, Taichang, Yifengyong, Daxingyong, Yuanyongxing, Yonghengyu, Yuantai Qianchangxiang, etc. in the field had no weak buying intention. At 9:30, it rose to 52 taels and 7 qian. HSBC announced that the British pound was as before, and the US dollar was reduced by 1.25, which was a exchange squeeze. At this time, the gold price was flat. Subsequently, Yuankangxiang Hengchangyong Yifengyong and others sold out, and Hengxing also took the field to sell over 100. It then became 1 tael and a half, with a fluctuation of 1 tael up and down. At 10:00, it was 52 taels, then 51 taels. Yuanmaoyong Zhaofengchang Yongfeng Yuanyongxing pledged.

Before long, it pulled up another tael, with zero accounts buying in. At 11:45, it was 1 tael and 8 qian. However, Hengyu Yuanchun and those covering short positions sold out, and it retreated to 1 tael again. At that time, it picked up to 1 tael and 7 qian, with scattered short positions covering. The noon close was 1 tael and 4 qian.</p>
<p>▲A scene of desolation in the afternoon market. The afternoon market opened at 1 tael and 3 qian, rising from 1 tael and 2 qian to 1 tael and 7 qian, because Yuanyongxing Dachencheng and goods, etc., bought in. After 2:15, Hengyu Zhaofengchang Fuxingyonglai sold, and Huabi offered the December US dollar at 6.875, immediately losing about 1 tael, at 50 taels and 8 qian. Afterwards, Huabi absorbed 30 yuan in February, making it 1 tael and a half, and then returning to 50 taels and 9 qian, with extremely little trading. Again, it stood at around 1 tael until 4:20, when Hengyu Yifengyong pulled in, slightly another 3 or 4 qian, for 1 tael and 4 qian, then closing at 51 taels and 3 qian, followed by 1 tael and 1 qian 2 qian. Goods made a small 3 qian, an increase of 3 taels and 9 qian compared to the morning. According to the whole day, the maximum was 2 taels and 7 liang, the minimum 0.05 qian, a difference of 2 taels and 2 qian. The red strips were counted as an increase of 15 taels.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation in the gold and silver industry was most prosperous with the rise of foreign coppers. This was because the sales channels were smooth, and the supply from silver and money businesses was abundant. The market suddenly showed a prosperous atmosphere. The current rise was entirely due to sales relationships. The needs of this port were limited. As for bank collections and settlements, they were moderately simple and complex. The shrinking trend of silver dollars continued. Yesterday, it shrank into the 400,000 qian mark.</p>
<p>▲The price of coppers exceeds the new high price. The morning market price of [foreign coppers] was half a li higher than the previous morning, exceeding the one-cent mark, at 7 qian 1 cent 0.0375.

<p>丨Yesterday, 1.45 Million Were Loaded丨</p>
<p>Since the middle of the week, the sudden increase in the amount shipped from foreign ports in Shanghai and the stabilizing of the prices of coppers, the suspension of the source of supply in Shanghai in various areas of demand has led to manipulative actions. The price of coppers has risen again in Dalian Changjiang and other places. Guangdong and Shantou Xiamen and other southern ports are feeling the extreme lack of market code, so they have sent messages to Shanghai to purchase and load. Yesterday, the silver industry received the news of purchase and loading, so they rushed to purchase in the market, and the price rose sharply. In summary, the shipments on the day totaled 350,000 for the Yangtze River, 400,000 for Dalian, 300,000 for Guangdong, and 200,000 each for Shantou and Xiamen, totaling 1.45 million.

<h3 id="e140">Securities and Bond Transactions Total 7.2 Million <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>丨Prices Continue to Rise Slightly, and the Trend Remains Peaceful丨</p>
<p>Yesterday (17th), the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange's bond market situation was that spot transactions were still sporadic. Although many types were traded, the total was only 26,000 yuan. The futures market was more prosperous than before, and the market atmosphere was still lively. However, large investors did not make huge entries or exits. The total for the day was 7.195 million yuan, including 1.3-1.4 million each for the unified salt tax and the Second Division. The Second Division's troop reduction was 7-800,000 each. However, the customs duties for 1896 remained very light. As for the trend of each bond price, the continued domestic and international situation did not have major developments, and the bond market environment was still quite dull. Therefore, the market atmosphere was quiet and stable. Although the transactions were still lively, most of them were term transactions. The supply and demand situation was quite balanced, so the trend of each price was still very stable. There was no significant fluctuation in the front and rear markets. However, the market demand was slightly more prosperous than the sale, and the price was slightly higher than the previous day, only around 0.3 yuan, except that the 1990 spot price was 1.1 yuan higher than last week.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that on Wednesday (the 16th), the New York stock market initially fluctuated due to Macy's canceling its dividend, with stocks falling by 1 to 4 yuan. Later, American Telephone and Telegraph, American Sugar, and Power Bond stocks announced that they would continue to pay dividends for this quarter, and people's hearts were slightly better. Some stocks also rebounded, but trading was still sluggish, with a total of 900,000 shares traded for the day. According to a report in the Steel Century magazine, the steel workload for this week was 19%, slightly lower than last week. Except for Cleveland, which needed a large amount of steel due to the automobile industry, the trade in other places was declining daily. The orders placed before the election, which were predicted earlier, have not been fulfilled. It is also heard that the Federal Reserve Board has decided to temporarily not sell the Federal public bonds of 1,800,000,000 yuan in the bank's inventory within a few months.

<p>The cotton yarn market has not escaped the sluggish situation. The atmosphere is dim, the actual demand is still sluggish, and the money supply is extremely tight. All gangs have no purchasing power. Therefore, many people are watching the decline and selling at high prices. The multi-headed Rongxing also cut ties, making it even more difficult for the market to stabilize. But American cotton is flat. In short, current sales are too few.</p>
<p>▲The general trend of the bid yarn is in the process of stabilization. The pre-bid market opened flat, and the atmosphere was still flat. Each month fell by 2-3 plates and then rebounded. The closing was tired, and the result was that each month rose by 2, 3, 4, or 5 qian. The afternoon situation was weak again, and each month rose or fell by 1, 2, or 3 qian. The total turnover for the day was 17,100 bales. It was found that Rongxing sold 500 bales, Yichang sold 550 bales, Dachang sold 450 bales, and Tonghe sold 450 bales. Dafeng bought 550 bales, Gengfeng bought 600 bales, Changfeng bought 1,600 bales, Shenchang bought 450 bales, and Shenji bought 500 bales. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>The cotton market is still firm. American cotton is stable, and the exchange rate is not moving. Therefore, the buyer's attitude is stable. As for a certain manufacturer's massive short selling, it is currently seeing that the source of supply from various routes is dwindling and the inventory is lacking. The recent cotton will be advanced, so the market situation is firm and the far month is also controlled by it. However, the market is trending towards a weak situation, the factory demand is still thin, and there is little confidence in the future situation. King</p>
<p>▲Zheng Biao is in a stable trend. The Zheng Biao pre-market opened with a slight increase in American cotton, and the market price of current cotton was higher. Therefore, there were fewer sellers in the field, and each month rose by 5 cents to 1.5 qian. The afternoon market atmosphere was still high, and each month rose by another 5 cents to 1 qian. The total turnover for the day was 40,600 dan.

Yangdujian and Bianyin Yuanwei lacked momentum, indicating a downstream trend.</p>
<p>▲ At Xinzha, cargo arrivals down the Suzhou River from inland areas were still strong, numbering around 42 or 43. The situation was in a slump. Regular Changzhou and Jiangyin white rice fell by around 0.2 tael. Luyang was sold as soon as it arrived. The opening set the tone. The six types of "Hundred Brothers" were undifferentiated.

<p>丨Hunan Rice Slightly Upward in Foreign Markets丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign merchant rice saw 本客 (local merchants?) disinterested. The previous day, no transactions occurred. Market sentiment and confidence were downward. The Fuzhou gang, which had a purchase appetite, saw prices weaken and resumed buying on the market, acquiring 1,600 packages of oil, Jing, and other rice from Hunan. Four hundred packages of foreign rice in small bags were acquired. Hunan rice prices fell 0.1 to 0.2 tael compared to the previous market. Due to sufficient inventory and ongoing shipments, cargo owners were eager to sell off at discounted prices, leading to price drops in transactions. Foreign rice, on the other hand, saw little circulating on the market and even fewer resales. Cargo owners had excellent sentiment. The price increase in small bags was slightly larger than the previous day, rising by 0.2 to 0.3 tael. North foreign gangs also casually purchased 500 large bags, with prices remaining at 6.5 yuan. Small bags were priced at 7.8 yuan, Hunan machine-processed oil rice at 8.85 to 8.78 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, machine-processed Jing rice was priced at 8.55 yuan. And, Jing rice was priced at 8 yuan.</p>

<p>丨All Other Months Consistently Lower丨</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw current flour from Beihua still strong, with a firm market trend. The price for flour from the Navy Yard has already reached 1 tael and 9 qian and 2.5 fen. Unbranded flour was consistently priced higher by 2.5 fen. However, current flour for the current month can still be drawn from the exchange. High-grade flour increased by 6 fen, while medium and second-grade flour increased by 4 to 2 fen. Currently, the northern rivers have not yet frozen, so the purchasing appetite is good and the market still shows promising signs. Futures prices declined across the board due to continuous firm orders for foreign wheat, with two ships scheduled to load on December 5th, and another ship of loose cargo loading immediately. Prices were 3 taels 4 qian 8 fen, 3 taels 5 qian 3 fen, and 3 taels 5 qian 6 fen. After Fufeng and other companies secured their orders, they immediately shorted the market, causing a consistent decline. However, the current month's price remains stable due to current flour availability. The closing price for the current month is still large at 0.075 tael, next month is small at 0.0125 tael, January is small at 0.015 tael, February is small at 0.01 tael, March is small at 0.0125 tael, and April is small at 0.01 tael, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw near-term and long-term prices decline consistently after opening in the morning and afternoon. Due to the small number of foreign wheat merchants and three more ships of Australian wheat being traded, prices also fell by a small amount of 0.03 to 0.04 tael. Sentiment was soft. Factories shorted flour futures, while traders and speculators shorted wheat futures. Therefore, prices for each month declined after the opening. The afternoon saw further weakness. The closing price for November was small, down 0.03 tael, December was not open, January fell by 0.06 tael, February was small, March was small, and April was small, down 0.04 tael. No current wheat in stock.

<h3 id="e150">Sugar Market: Arrival of Large Quantities of Dutch Red Sugar Causes Weakness <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw an increase in the premium and a slight reduction in Dutch sugar, which would normally be expected to lead to an increase in price. However, weak sales from all parties in the past week caused the public association's assessment to decline slightly. No. 24 coarse sugar and ordinary white sugar was initially assessed at 14 taels 8 qian 2.5 fen, then later assessed at 8 qian 1.25 fen, a decrease of 0.025 to 0.0375 tael compared to the previous day. High-grade RA sugar was priced at 14 taels 9 qian 2.5 fen. No. 18 medium-grade white sugar was priced at 14 taels. No. 20 medium-grade white sugar was priced at 14 taels 3 qian due to a lack of goods and no arrivals. Very firm. Due to the recent arrival of over 48,000 packages of No. 8, 9, and 10 Dutch red sugar, there was a sudden feeling of oversupply, and the trend weakened. There is a risk of continued weakening in the future market. The arrival of Jianbing brand goods has recently slightly increased, but sales are not strong, resulting in no large-scale transactions. Yesterday's market saw a total of 0.98 tael of manual ice sugar sold, with some sales, it is said.</p>

<p>The New York raw silk market has returned to weakness. Actual sales in Lyon are still sluggish. European and American firms in Shanghai are all considering taking advantage of low prices to stockpile, while factories believe that silk production costs are relatively high and are unwilling to sell at a loss. The market atmosphere is sluggish and quiet.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market for foreign firms in this port saw British firms such as Jardine Matheson, Ewo, and Xiangfu actively purchasing high-quality Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas. Transactions were quite strong. However, due to the market's prolonged sluggishness, Chinese tea merchants' financial strength was particularly weak. Market prices for Zhenmei from Wudong Tunxi have fallen to over 70 taels, another 6 or 7 taels lower than before. As for Zhenmei from Wubei, firms such as Baochang and Tianxiang had some negotiations, but there was no major progress. Transactions for other varieties such as Gongxi pearl tea were also scarce, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Oil Market: Asphalt and Zhejiang Road Oil Surge <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The asphalt market in Hubei remains stable, while Zhejiang Road overall reports surging prices. Because Hangzhou stated that the large drop in oil prices and cheap sales have long been exhausted, and new goods have not arrived, various oil merchants were originally low on inventory and prepared to sell. New oil merchants have not acquired new goods and most pressing mills have not yet bought seeds, so they are unwilling to sell. This has caused a slight rise in prices, and asphalt prices have also increased. But this is only due to psychological factors. Merchants see that market prices have already risen, so they refrain from buying, and sales are still slow. Therefore, after the price increase, transactions have become quieter than before the increase, and the market has gradually become flat. It is currently heard that Zhejiang seeds are being actively sold at the origin, but sales have not improved, so there is a fear that the current situation may be difficult to sustain. This port's merchants have limited inventory and often receive mixed-grade oils, so they are unable to actively acquire new goods. Therefore, although Zhejiang oil is reported to be increasing in price, they are indifferent to it.</p>

<h3 id="e170">Vietnamese Petition Delegates Depart Motherland Tomorrow Morning <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>▲Continued Submission of Four Supplementary Points to the Sino-French Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>▲Hope for National Unity Against External Forces</p>
<p>▲Industrial and Commercial Circles Urgently Study and Ensure Quality Products</p>
<p>Mr. Huang An and Mr. Xu Yixian, delegates of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Cochinchina, Vietnam, who came to the country to petition and seek the amendment of the Sino-French Commercial Treaty, entered Beijing last week. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already agreed to negotiate with the French government within the shortest possible time. The delegates considered that the main objective had been achieved, so they returned to Shanghai to await the ship back to Vietnam. Yesterday, the delegates submitted four additional points to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The original submission is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>▲Supplementary Submission of Four Important Points: Submission for the supplementary submission of four points, requesting negotiations with France and prompt conclusion of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty to safeguard the overseas Chinese in Vietnam, plus return to the country to petition and expedite the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty. During the time in Beijing, the esteemed Minister and Vice Minister of your Ministry (and various committee members) personally summoned and interviewed us and promised to negotiate with France within the shortest possible period to finalize and implement [the treaty], etc. The delegates, on behalf of more than 300,000 overseas Chinese in Vietnam, sincerely thank your esteemed Ministry (Commission). However, there are still four crucial facts regarding the amendment of this Commercial Treaty, which are supplemented below as a basis for negotiation: 1. Upon examining the Sino-French Commercial Treaty signed on May 16, 1930, Schedule A lists 27 categories of goods exported from our country to France that are subject to the lowest tariff rates, including wool, ham, leather, pork, raw silk, wax, musk, cattle horns, sweet potatoes, fresh fruit, marble, dried fruit or candied fruit, lead, black lead, lead ingots, pure tin, compound tin, tin ingots, ink and ink sticks, Chinese medicinal materials, lead with and without antimony, paper, cardboard, tanned leather fans. Very few other goods are shipped from our country to Vietnam; although they are nominally included, we do not actually benefit from them. The main goods that our country currently exports to Vietnam are silk fabrics (silk satins, damasks), tea, porcelain, sacrificial items (incense, candles, firecrackers, paper flowers, tin foil), food (noodles, rice flour, pastries, soy sauce), rattan and rattan products. These goods, which are the most frequently sold, are missing from the original list. The amendment of the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty must include these items. In the original list, except for retaining Chinese medicinal materials, brushes, paper, ink, fresh fruits, cooked fruits, cooked vegetables, tin items, and leather, the remaining items can be directly deleted. 2. In the Sino-French Commercial Treaty, although the original list only includes five categories of French goods shipped to China that are subject to the lowest tariff rates, namely coal, furs, woodenware, nutmeg, and rice, these items are practically beneficial. Among them, rice accounts for the largest share, followed by coal. Since rice is a staple food, there is a need to regulate shortages and surpluses. It should be studied whether special tax regulations can be included. 3. Appendix 3(a) of the Sino-French Commercial Treaty stipulates that France requires overseas Chinese in Vietnam to continue exercising their historically enjoyed special rights in relation to tax matters (i.e., surtaxes and other taxes). The special rights referred to by the French have now lost their special nature due to changes in circumstances, environment, personnel, and laws. Since rights have been extinguished, obligations should also be cancelled. Special attention should be paid to deleting this clause. 4. The amount of customs revenue is related to the prosperity of goods and population. The prosperity of import goods is related to the high or low customs tariff rates. Taking Chinese silk fabrics as an example, in the past, approximately 28 million taels were shipped from Shanghai to Vietnam each year. Since the increase in tariff rates, less than 2 million taels are shipped each year. The same applies to other goods. Therefore, the result of the increased tax rate in Vietnam is a loss for both sides. Furthermore, the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese are an important factor in the rise and fall of Vietnamese industries. If the economic situation of the overseas Chinese falls into an absolutely depressed state, the Vietnamese government, although not necessarily facing complete ruin, will suffer mutual harm. This relationship of interests should be explained to France to encourage them to pay attention. The above four points are only the most obvious. In summary, the overseas Chinese in Vietnam are already in a very difficult situation. It is not enough to maintain their livelihoods unless the aforementioned points are reached, the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty is finalized, and prompt implementation is achieved. It is reasonable to resubmit four points to your esteemed Ministry (Commission) for review. It is sincerely requested that you promptly negotiate with France to conclude the Sino-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, alleviate the suffering of the overseas Chinese, and ensure public convenience. In addition to submitting separately, we respectfully submit this.</p>
<p>▲The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Approval Order to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce: Regarding the submission prepared by Huang and Xu when the two delegates entered Beijing, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to promptly negotiate with the French government, the association received an approval order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating, "Received and noted. The Sino-French Vietnam Treaty is yet to be approved and implemented due to the unfinished schedule. The schedule is currently being actively negotiated by the Ministry with the French side. Once completed and finalized, the treaty can be approved and implemented by both parties. Please be informed accordingly." The association has forwarded the approval to Huang and Xu for their information.</p>
<p>▲Departing Shanghai for Vietnam Tomorrow Morning: According to Mr. Huang and Mr. Xu from the Vietnamese overseas Chinese delegation speaking to the National News Agency yesterday, they were greatly grateful that their petition for the Vietnamese overseas Chinese had been kindly received by the government and various organizations, who had generously accommodated their opinions and sincerely provided guidance and assistance. Now that their mission is completed, they are scheduled to board the French mail ship tomorrow morning to bid farewell to the motherland and return to Vietnam. Upon arrival, in addition to striving to promote patriotism among the overseas Chinese, they hope that the country will unite and work together to face external forces. Industrial and commercial circles, in addition to urgently seeking to improve product quality, must further develop foreign trade. This is the sincere prayer of overseas Chinese living under the eaves of others, they said. The French mail ship *Général Metzinger*, which Mr. Huang and others will be traveling on, left Shanghai yesterday morning. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and other organizations will send representatives to board the ship with the two delegates tonight.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Details of the Sinking of the Fuqing <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>▲Arson for Help Was Not Due to Carelessness</p>
<p>▲Distressed Crew and Passengers Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Cargo Loss Exceeds 300,000</p>
<p>The sinking of the Fuqing steamer of the Qipu Fuxing Public Company in the outer Dongsha area of Wusong has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Further details of the incident are reported as follows:</p>
<p>▲Boiler Damaged En Route: The Fuqing ship specializes in the Shanghai-Quanzhou route. On the 16th of this month, it set sail from Shanghai fully loaded with cargo for Quanzhou. Around 11:00 AM, after departing, around 4:00 PM, it reached the outer Dongsha waters of Wusong. The boiler suddenly broke down. The old engineer reported to the captain, who then ordered the ship to drop anchor and stop sailing to repair the boiler. Repairing the boiler took from 4:00 PM to 7:40 PM, but it was not yet completed and still could not sail. The crew members, except for those working, went to their cabins to sleep. At 7:50 PM, the ship suddenly tilted to the right and very quickly. Within a few minutes, the ship was lying horizontally on the sea. The cargo on deck all fell into the sea, and the items in the cabins were tossed to one side. The passengers in bed also fell down.</p>
<p>▲Calling for Help in the Dark Without Response: After the ship tilted, seawater rushed into the cabins wildly, and the furnaces in the engine room were submerged in water. The whole ship lost power. Passengers and crew members struggled out of their cabins in the dark. Unable to walk, they climbed onto the railing of the port side deck barefoot and disheveled. Due to the suddenness of the escape, many crew members and passengers did not have time to put on clothes. At that time, the whistle could not be sounded, and flags could not be hoisted in the dark. The ship was sinking rapidly. All the crew members could only shout for help. Although a ship was seen passing by, it was too far away, and their calls went unanswered.</p>
<p>▲Starting a Fire to Signal for Rescue: By 9:30 PM, seeing that the ship was about to sink and all dozens of people were about to be buried at sea, the crew members and the captain finally decided to set fire to signal for rescue, hoping that another ship would see them. However, there was no way to retrieve the flares, so they found a way to move the firewood carried in the cabin to the riverside platform and set it on fire. The firewood was ignited very quickly, and the fire lit up the sky in an instant. At that time, the Ruikang of the Sanfa Company and the Zhengzhou of the Hezhong Company were coming to Shanghai from Qingdao and Haizhou, respectively. Seeing the large fire on the sea, they suspected that it was due to a merchant ship's carelessness and came to the rescue.</p>
<p>▲Entire Crew and Passengers Rescued: The Ruikang was the first to see the fire. The comprador Xiaojueren ordered the ship to speed towards Dongsha. Approaching the Fuqing, they saw that the ship had capsized and sunk, and the crew members, sailors, and passengers were clinging to the deck railing, their lower bodies already submerged in the water. In the urgent situation, the Ruikang immediately launched a large sampan to rescue people. After three trips, they rescued the captain Bai Ximan (Russian), driver Le Dagen, old engineer Liu Fuquan, second engineer Jin, supervisor Lin Liulian, and water passengers, a total of more than 40 people. The Zhengzhou also arrived and sent a sampan to rescue a total of 15 passengers and sailors. The rescued crew and passengers were soaked, and their luggage was not retrieved. After boarding the ship, the crew members of the two ships took good care of them, helping them dry their wet clothes. Around 7:00 AM yesterday, they were transported to Shanghai and disembarked at the Hongxing Wharf.</p>
<p>▲Five More Sailors Arrived Later: There were two stokers, a servant, an oiler, and a waiter who had boarded a small sampan and left the Fuqing when the accident occurred. By yesterday afternoon, they had not been found, and everyone suspected that they must have met with an accident. Just as they were anxiously hoping for news, the five men reported at 3:30 PM that they had arrived safely in Shanghai. After the Ruikang rescued the crew members, the Fuqing sank within half an hour. According to the distressed passengers speaking to reporters yesterday, if the Ruikang had arrived an hour later, the entire ship would have been lost to the sea.</p>
<p>▲Estimated Cargo Loss: The Fuqing was loaded with 14,000 bags of flour and bran, more than 2,000 pieces of groceries and oil drums, pears, etc., all of which were lost. The total loss of cargo is estimated at 200,000 yuan. The ship was purchased by Fuxing in 1924 and was originally a patrol vessel of the Datong Telegraph Bureau. The iron plates were quite thick, and the ship was solid. The declared tonnage was 950 tons. This sinking will cause a loss of 100,000 yuan for the ship itself. In addition, the clothing and luggage of the crew members and passengers will also require more than 10,000 yuan. The ship was originally insured for 50,000 taels for marine insurance. It was suddenly withdrawn this year, insuring only 30,000 taels. The cargo owners and insurance companies have been notified yesterday.</p>
<p>▲Personnel Dispatched for Inspection Today: The accident of this ship is indeed peculiar. Anchoring and capsizing is unheard of. After repeated investigations by reporters with the victims, it was said that the cargo was overloaded on the deck, and the decks were covered with heavy oil drums, so the top was heavy and the bottom was light, causing it to tilt to one side and causing the disaster. However, the company still needs to investigate the truth of the accident. It has been agreed to send a small motorboat with the shipowners to the scene of the accident to investigate this morning. When the Ruikang came to Shanghai yesterday morning, the Fuqing was only one foot above the surface of the water. At high tide, it is feared that it will sink completely.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Residents in Pengpu District Automatically Remove Forest Stumps Placed to Encircle Land <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>▲Railway Bureau Reports and Requests Instructions Separately Upon Receiving News</p>
<p>▲Villagers in the District Petition Party Headquarters Again</p>
<p>The villagers of Wangjiajing, Zhuxiang, and Zhao Jiahuayuan in Pengpu District, because their petition to the Municipal Government had not yielded results, convened a meeting on their own initiative. Each village was responsible for removing all the land enclosure stumps, forests, and notices near their village to show their determination. This morning, more than 700 villagers implemented the plan and removed the stumps, throwing them into the river. The notices posted at the Wangjiajing Zhuang entrance of the Jiaotong Road were also thrown into the river. When a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inspected the area yesterday, all the wooden stumps erected by the Ministry of Railways were gone, and the boundaries could no longer be distinguished.</p>
<p>▲Railway Bureau Reports: After receiving the news, the two railway bureaus immediately notified the Municipal Government to order the Public Security and Land Bureaus to protect the area and reported to the Ministry of Railways and requested instructions on how to handle the situation.</p>
<p>▲Villagers' Statement: According to the villagers, after the stumps were removed, if the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to the village to measure and re-erect the stumps before allowing detours, the villagers were prepared to reject the measurement.</p>
<p>▲Petition to Party Headquarters: The villagers' representatives, Hou Xuanqing, and others, led more than 400 villagers to the Municipal Party Headquarters again at 4:00 PM yesterday, holding white petition flags. However, because the office hours were over and no one was in charge, the petition did not yield results, and they left.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Pan Yunchao Discusses the Current Situation of the Northeastern Volunteer Army <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>▲Able to Settle Down When the Green Gauze Curtain Falls</p>
<p>▲Singing Uninterrupted Amidst the Sound of Gunfire</p>
<p>▲Lack No Sharp Weapons but Lack Supplies</p>
<p>Mr. Pan Yunchao, a member of the Central Committee, recently went to the Central Government to negotiate the issue of assisting the Volunteer Army. Now that the matter is completed, Mr. Pan returned to Shanghai yesterday and reported on the recent activities of the Northeastern Volunteer Army. They are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Time of Panic: According to Mr. Pan, the Volunteer Army's ability to operate in the Northeast during the summer and autumn months, causing pain to the Japanese army and exhausting them, relied entirely on the dense green gauze curtain of sorghum. The fertile fields stretched for thousands of miles, and the Volunteer Army relied on this natural barrier to advance to attack and retreat to defend. The heroic feats of the past few months have been witnessed by the world. However, at this time, early winter has arrived, and the sorghum has withered and fallen. The green gauze curtain, which was regarded as the only natural barrier, has disappeared with the seasons. Therefore, the people are deeply worried that with the loss of the natural barrier, the Volunteer Army will have nowhere to stand and will lose the opportunity to launch attacks.</p>
<p>▲Peacefully Passed: Contrary to what we deeply worried about, the Northeastern Volunteer Army authorities knew that they would have nowhere to stand with the loss of this natural barrier. Therefore, they had long utilized the towering mountains as a base for retreat and concealment. The mountains in the Northeast are continuous, the trees provide shade, and the terrain is dangerous, which the Japanese army deeply fears. The area within these mountains is quite vast, not only capable of accommodating tens of thousands of Volunteer Army soldiers but also extremely prosperous with villages and residences. The Volunteer Army used this as a base to defend it firmly. When the Japanese army came to encircle, they hid deeply and did not come out. When the Japanese army was lax, they waited for the opportunity to attack. Even if the Japanese army did not avoid hardship and led troops to advance sharply, they could still design to annihilate them. Therefore, the Japanese army never dared to go deep.</p>
<p>Singing Uninterrupted: The Volunteer Army's supplies and other necessities are extremely difficult in these deep mountains surrounded by enemies. However, because these towering mountains have many residents, the food issue can still be dealt with. Furthermore, since people each have the determination to die, both the Volunteer Army and the residents, men and women, old and young, can cooperate wholeheartedly. They know that once the Volunteer Army is defeated and the Japanese army moves in, both the good and the bad will be destroyed under the Japanese army's oppressive force. However, the Japanese army often sends aircraft to bomb them. But because the trees are lush all day long, making it difficult to find targets, the destructive power is minimal. The people have also become accustomed to this and do not find it frightening. Recently, it was reported that in the Volunteer Army base in the deep mountains of Liaonan and Liaodong, the original elementary and middle schools are still able to teach as usual, and the sound of reading is uninterrupted. This is also something we never imagined.</p>
<p>Self-Made Sharp Weapons: In addition, there is another thing that we never imagined: This group of soldiers, retreating and hiding in the deep mountains, is now being surrounded by the Japanese army. Although the Japanese army does not dare to go deep, they have to mobilize troops to encircle them, and their only goal is to cut off the Volunteer Army's supplies of ammunition and other necessities to weaken their combat capability. Unexpectedly, recent reports indicate that there are many outstanding talents in the Kangbei Volunteer Army who can come up with solutions in the absence of solutions and self-make sharp weapons. All gunpowder, bullets, hand grenades, rifles, and even artillery can be self-made. Therefore, this group of Volunteer Army soldiers hiding in the mountains and being surrounded has a small arsenal with this new invention, and they are not feeling the difficulty. The Japanese army authorities are also extremely surprised by this and cannot figure it out no matter how hard they try.</p>
<p>Exhausted: Although many Northeastern Volunteer Army troops are surrounded by the Japanese army in the deep mountains, most of them can still carry out fully mobile strategic warfare in the snowy and icy conditions because the Japanese army's troops cannot reach them. They often take advantage of high winds and dark nights to carry out raids on camps. They may have thousands of people, or as few as two or three people, using feigned attacks or outwitting the enemy. Every time they raid the camp late at night, the Volunteer Army only fires one shot, and the Japanese army, hearing this alarm, does not know how many troops are outside. They then collapse and fire bullets indiscriminately, wasting ammunition in vain. The Volunteer Army has already left at this time. This action is enough to make the Japanese army both shocked and afraid. Mobilizing troops and generals has become increasingly exhausting, and the Volunteer Army has already taken advantage of the weakness of their troops to attack.</p>
<p>Difficulty in Supply: The Volunteer Army's combat capability has been clearly determined and has not been reduced due to the destruction of the green gauze curtain. The Japanese army's claim that it could clear the area within three months has also been found to be unreliable. However, what they feel most difficult is the lack of clothing. To this day, most of the Volunteer Army soldiers still lack winter clothing. Therefore, compatriots at home and abroad should find ways to help them so that the Volunteer Army can survive this winter and be able to defeat the Japanese army to the death next spring. In addition, it is now known that fire has disappeared from the Volunteer Army's location, and they have restored the old method of finding fire from decades ago. And kerosene and other items have had to be replaced with soybean oil, peanut oil, etc.</p>
<p>Unified Command: Furthermore, the Volunteer Army's combat effectiveness is sufficient to exhaust the Japanese army. However, due to the lack of unified command, even large-scale plans often cannot be realized. Therefore, it has been suggested that a military commission be established to be responsible for directing operations. In addition, this organization can also fairly distribute the Volunteer Army's supplies, finances, and supervision, ensuring that there is no imbalance. In this way, military power can be unified, and there is no need to worry about supplies. In the future, it will be easier to fight in the Northeast. Also, now that the Japanese army knows that it cannot deal with the Northeastern Volunteer Army, it often buys local militias for its use. This is a very painful thing.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Huge Sums Continue to Be Transported to the Northeast <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Three Million Yuan</p>
<p>Regarding the collection and transportation of cash in Shanghai for the Northeast, two batches have already been exported, totaling more than 5.2 million yuan. As previously reported, these were transported to the puppet state. It is now known that a third batch of huge cash amounts, transported from Shanghai to Shenyang, has been shipped by companies such as Dongshunji, amounting to 3 million yuan. It will still be transported to Dalian by British ships, and then transferred to Shenyang via the South Manchuria Railway. This large sum of cash is all Yuan Datou national currency. It is scheduled to be exported from Shanghai tomorrow (Saturday).</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Second Batch of the Volunteer Army Medical Relief Team Departs Today <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The first batch of the Northeast Volunteer Army Medical Relief Team departed from Beiping on the 15th of last month to Kailu, providing medical relief under He Qingming's department under Feng Zhanhai. The second batch of team members underwent physical examinations and reviews of their medical knowledge yesterday. The team also judged their will and character, and it has been decided that they will depart today. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Screening of Departing Team Members: Starting at 8:00 AM yesterday, the team conducted physical examinations of the team members at the Nanyang Hospital on Huangjia Road, assessing the team members' character and qualifications. After arriving at the hospital, team members first reported at the registration desk, then went to the examination room. Examiners Huang Zhong, Wang Mengying, and Huangfu Jun, among others, were responsible for the examinations. They also asked questions about general medical and rescue knowledge such as:</p>
<p>What types of wounds are there? What are the first aid treatments for wounds? What are the methods of wound disinfection? How many types of disinfectants are there? What are the pre-operative disinfection procedures (surgical treatments, etc.)? After the examination, forms were filled out. The teams then went to the screening room, where screeners Fei Jian, Tao Zuyin, and Wang Changyan, among others, assessed will, character, qualifications, and history. During the screening, they inquired about various rescue skills to assess the team member's character and the like. These were also recorded on forms for future reference. Yesterday, over 80 team members were examined and screened. The examination and screening will continue today.</p>
<p>Departure This Afternoon: After the examination and screening are completed today, some team members will be selected as the second batch of departing team members, totaling over 20 people. The remaining team members will depart in the third batch. At 11:00 PM this afternoon, the team, led by team leader Fei Jian, will depart on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway night express, first to Bengbu. There, they will gather with the 80+ members of the team’s second company. Then, Fei Jian and the second company commander Chen Ruchen will go to Beiping to negotiate locations, winter clothing and food, and other issues. Once the negotiations are completed, they will lead the second batch of team members out of the pass, directly to the battlefield, without delay. After the second batch arrives at the battlefield, commander Chen Ruchen of the second company will be responsible for everything at the front. Team leader Fei Jian will return to Shanghai to plan for the departure of the third batch of team members. According to team leader Fei Jian yesterday, the team is currently planning to send 20 batches, each with about 100 people. The team’s existence is equal to that of the Northeast's Volunteer Army: once the Volunteer Army is dissolved, the team will also come to an end. If the Volunteer Army exists for one day, the seventh team will continue its efforts and rescue for one day, vowing not to withdraw halfway.</p>
<p>Submitting a Report to the Party Headquarters for Guidance: To facilitate the team's operations and for the sake of prudence, the team will gradually establish a board of directors, a board of supervisors, etc. Yesterday, a special report was submitted to the municipal party headquarters, requesting that personnel be dispatched for guidance. The original report stated: "Regarding the report, since the establishment of our team, patriotic compatriots at home and abroad have given enthusiastic support. The various developments have been reported one after another. The first batch of team members above Beiping departed for the war zone on the deleted date of last month to carry out medical relief work. The second batch is now organized and ready to depart soon, and the third batch is also in active progress. Now that the team's affairs are increasing, the original eight members are insufficient to handle them. In addition, the community donations are increasing daily. For the sake of prudence, the team intends to organize a board of directors to handle all affairs and a board of supervisors to supervise them. The board of directors will hire bankers, business leaders, lawyers, accountants, doctors, and enthusiastic patriotic philanthropists with experience to organize design and finance committees to guide and handle matters. Attached is a draft of the board of directors' organization, submitting it for your review. If it is appropriate, we request that you approve it and dispatch personnel to supervise and guide us, so that we may follow and benefit the rescue efforts. This is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters."</p>
<p>Donations Received Yesterday: Yichangxing, Yuxinxiang, one yuan each. Nanrenhe, Beirenhe, five yuan each. Wanyuxiang, two yuan. Dafeng, Wanli, Fuhexiang, Weida, Yu Zhangyuan, Xiecheng, Asia, Medali, Anonymous, one yuan each. Henglong, Ren Yunsheng, Zhongyang, Tongrenhe, Tongyu, Wansheng, Guohua, Jixiangyong, Tongyichun, 50 cents each. Yesterday, the employees of Hongzhang Textile Washing and Dyeing Factory donated 294 comforters to the team.</p>
<h3 id="e176">The Entire Illegal Loan Contract for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Signed by Li Guojie <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>▲Officially Announced by the Ministry of Communications the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Divided into 1) Contract, 2) Memorandum, 3) Lease, 4) Contract for Payment of Mortgage Money</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the much-publicized illegal loan contracted by Li Guojie of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) with the American China Ventures, Inc., the Ministry of Communications, after repeated research and review of the original contract, believed that the contract was extremely detrimental to the interests of the CMSNC. The case has been severely handled by the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan according to law, with the aim of revoking the harmful contract. In order to clarify the content and Li Guojie's mistakes to the people, the Ministry of Communications publicly announced the entire illegal contract on the night of the 16th. This contract is divided into: 1) Contract, containing 19 articles; 2) Contract Memorandum, divided into parts A and B, and 15 sections of methods; 3) Lease, divided into 15 articles; and 4) Contract specifying the payment dates and amounts of the mortgage money, divided into 17 articles, totaling four major parts. A copy of the entire contract has now been found and is disclosed below.</p>
<p>Contract: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (hereinafter referred to as the CMSNC; this abbreviation, along with successors, heirs, or representatives, is included), American China Ventures, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the Ventures; this abbreviation, along with successors or heirs, is included),</p>

Having been agreed upon by both parties, the articles are stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The CMSNC is willing to hand over to the Ventures the real estate specified in the mortgage agreement signed with the Ventures on September 5, 1932, including Land Register Nos. 54A, 54B, 53, and 53A in the Central District of the Shanghai International Settlement, as well as the existing buildings on the land and any new buildings constructed during the mortgage period, as collateral for the bonds issued as stated in this contract. (It is verified that the aforementioned real estate belongs to the property of the CMSNC's Accumulated Property Co., Ltd., which has fully approved the mortgage and the matters stated in this contract. The board of directors of the company has acknowledged it, and the chairman of the board will sign and seal the contract and mortgage agreement as proof.) (2) Mutually acknowledged by both parties, for the purpose of raising the aforementioned mortgage money, the Ventures may, using the aforementioned property listed in the mortgage agreement as collateral, issue bonds with a total face value not exceeding Shanghai Tael 10 million, with a term of 20 years, at a net receipt of 85%. Furthermore, the issued bonds shall be completely separate from the bonds already issued or to be issued by the Ventures or its designee in order to be recognized. (3) Mutually agreed by both parties that the CMSNC shall pay the Ventures interest on the mortgage at an annual rate of 9%, calculated based on the face value of the issued bonds. The interest shall be paid every three months, and any interest not paid on time shall also accrue compound interest at an annual rate of 9%. (4) Mutually acknowledged and agreed by both parties that the amount of discount and interest on the mortgage loan and bond issuance, whether profit or loss, is the sole responsibility of the Ventures and has nothing to do with the CMSNC. (5) After this contract and the mortgage agreement mentioned in this contract have been formally signed and sealed by both parties, the Ventures shall, in accordance with the actual receipt discount and all the regulations stated in this contract, immediately issue the first batch of bonds for this mortgage loan, with a face value of Shanghai Tael 4 million, to meet the CMSNC's needs as follows: (A) Repay the loan of one million taels previously mortgaged to Citibank with Land Register Nos. 54A, 54B, and 53 of the British Municipal Council, and the interest due. (B) Repay the loan of 470,000 taels previously mortgaged to the China Ventures, Inc. with Land Register No. 53A, and the interest due. (C) Pay the CMSNC 500,000 taels to meet the CMSNC's business needs. (D) Allocate funds for the construction of the most modern office building at the corner of Szechuan Road and Fuzhou Road as originally decided. (E) Pay the Ventures 2.5% of the face value of the first batch of bonds issued for this mortgage. (6) The remaining amount of the bonds with a face value of Shanghai Tael 10 million shall be issued by the Ventures in successive periods at appropriate times, and the proceeds shall be used primarily for the construction of the newest office building on the aforementioned land specified in the mortgage agreement. (7) Both parties acknowledge that all matters related to building construction shall be under the full management of the Ventures. The plans and specifications for the new buildings on the land specified in this contract and the mortgage agreement shall be submitted by the Ventures to the CMSNC for record. It is also expressly acknowledged by both parties that all technical issues regarding the style and engineering of the buildings shall be solely managed by the Ventures. (8) During the mortgage period, the CMSNC acknowledges and agrees to pay the Ventures a rental commission of 5% based on the amount of rent collected by the Ventures on its behalf. All management and services for the buildings shall also be borne by the Ventures. (9) Regarding the cash proceeds from the sale of bonds, from the date of receipt to the date of the next payment to the CMSNC, interest shall be calculated at the bank's current account interest rate. (10) The CMSNC also acknowledges that from the date of sale of the bonds stipulated in this contract, all rents on the real estate mentioned in this contract, and all rents currently collected by the Ventures, and whose real estate belongs to the CMSNC and is not within the scope of this contract, and which have already been mortgaged by the CMSNC to the Ventures and are not within the scope of this contract, and future rent, etc. (attached rent bill) shall be collected by the Ventures. This income shall first be used to pay the interest on other mortgages due to the Ventures, and then to pay the interest on this mortgage stipulated under this contract. If the collected interest is insufficient to pay the interest on this mortgage stipulated under this contract, the unpaid interest shall be added to the CMSNC's debt account as an outstanding interest account, which shall also accrue compound interest at an annual rate of 9%. If there are sufficient funds from the collected rent or other sources, it shall be paid off immediately. If there are any surplus funds from the collected rent, they shall be immediately deposited into the CMSNC's bond repayment reserve fund account for the purpose of paying the total face value of the bonds issued for this mortgage under this contract and the interest due on this mortgage. The Ventures shall make every effort to ensure that the funds in this income reserve fund account are used to generate the maximum possible interest. The maximum interest obtained must also be deposited into the bond repayment reserve fund account. The amount already deposited into the CMSNC's bond repayment reserve fund account shall be managed by the Ventures in full, but if the CMSNC has a good plan to generate higher interest on this reserve fund, it may make suggestions to the Ventures. (11) The CMSNC acknowledges that when occupying newly built buildings, it is willing to pay the corresponding rent, but it will not pay rent for the currently occupied old buildings. The CMSNC also acknowledges that if the location of the old buildings currently occupied by the CMSNC is needed for new construction, upon notification from the Ventures, it shall move out within three months from the date of the notification. (12) The CMSNC acknowledges that it shall pay the Ventures 2.5% of the face value of the bonds issued under this contract. This payment shall be paid on the date of sale of each bond. (13) The Ventures agrees that the various income and expenditure accounts under this contract shall be completely independent and separate from the Ventures' inherent business accounts. (14) The CMSNC acknowledges and agrees that no part of the real estate mentioned in this contract shall be re-mortgaged externally, and guarantees responsibility for handling all negotiations to eliminate any legal interference. Furthermore, any negotiations regarding existing second mortgages on the property shall be the responsibility of the CMSNC and have nothing to do with the Ventures. (15) Both parties understand and agree that in the event that the CMSNC wishes to sell all or part of the aforementioned real estate during the term of this contract or before this mortgage has been cleared, the Ventures shall have the right of first refusal to purchase all or part of the property. It is also agreed by both parties that whether the sale is handled by the CMSNC or the Ventures, a standard commission of 2.5% shall be paid to the Ventures. (16) In the event that the CMSNC is unable to pay the principal and interest due on the aforementioned mortgage represented by the total face value of the issued bonds, or the funds in the CMSNC's bond repayment reserve fund account are insufficient to pay all or part of the principal due on the aforementioned mortgage represented by the total face value of the issued bonds, and the interest due on this mortgage, the Ventures shall have full power to dispose of the property, either by public auction or by private sale, of all or part of the properties mentioned in this contract to repay the principal and interest due. If this is still insufficient, the CMSNC shall compensate in other ways. If there is a surplus, the Ventures shall pay it to the CMSNC after clearing the principal and interest due. (17) The Ventures acknowledges that once the principal, other payments, and commissions, etc., of the bonds issued under this contract have been fully paid, all the real estate mentioned in this contract shall be transferred back to the CMSNC by the Ventures. (18) Both parties mutually acknowledge that from the date of signing the contract, regardless of any problems, disputes, or disagreements that may arise, they shall immediately engage two impartial persons. One impartial person shall be selected by the CMSNC, and one shall be selected by the Ventures. If the two impartial persons cannot agree, the two impartial persons shall jointly elect a leading impartial person, all of whom shall be determined in accordance with current American law. The result of the determination, whether determined by the two impartial persons or by the leading impartial person, shall be acknowledged and obeyed by both parties, and they are willing to comply with it. If one party has notified the other party of its appointed impartial person and the other party fails to designate or refuses to designate its impartial person within ten days, then regardless of any problems, disputes, or disagreements, the party that has already selected an impartial person may immediately submit it to that party's impartial person for sole decision. It is also acknowledged and agreed by both parties that in all of the above situations, the result of the determination of the impartial person appointed by the one party shall be fully obeyed by that party and the other party, and the impartial person of the one party shall be regarded as being appointed by both parties.

<p>Memorandum to the Contract: China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (hereinafter referred to as Party A; this abbreviation, along with successors, heirs, or representatives, is included), American China Ventures, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as Party B; this abbreviation, along with successors, heirs, or representatives, is included). Now, Party A's existing merchant ships are too old and uneconomical, and it wishes to purchase a considerable number of ships to replace them. Party A and Party B have consulted with the American Dollar Steamship Lines. The points agreed upon by both parties are recorded below. (A) Dollar Steamship Lines is willing to purchase suitable ships for Party A at the lowest price, up to 30 ships, for Party A's current Yangtze River and North and South Seas shipping business. (B) For the mutual benefit of Party A and Dollar Steamship Lines, Party A and Dollar Steamship Lines shall establish a mutual cooperation agreement in the shipping business. The most important of these is that the two companies shall mutually issue through bills of lading, so that the goods transported by the two companies can be directly transported from their respective export locations to the destination. Therefore, Dollar Steamship Lines' responsibility for purchasing ships on behalf of the CMSNC, and its willingness to undertake such purchases, were mutually acknowledged and agreed upon on December 11 of last year in Shanghai by Li Weihou, the chairman of the board of directors representing the CMSNC, Guo Waifeng, the commissioner for reorganizing the CMSNC representing the National Government of Nanjing, Dollar Staley, the vice president of Dollar Steamship Lines, Steiger, the Shanghai manager of Dollar Steamship Lines, and Detry, the president of Party B. As the general office of Dollar Steamship Lines is located in San Francisco, California, USA, and the Shanghai manager of Dollar Steamship Lines is currently in the United States, and as the proposed matter is of great importance, all detailed terms must be discussed and stipulated again by Party A and Dollar Steamship Lines before a final mutual agreement can be reached. Therefore, Party A and Party B deem it appropriate to first sign a preliminary contract, including important principles, as the basis for the final contract. This contract is based on the receipt by Party B of one silver dollar from Party A, and Party B is willing to first stipulate the important terms with Party A on behalf of Dollar Steamship Lines. After this stipulation, Dollar Steamship Lines shall purchase the agreed number of ships for Party A from its general offices and branch offices in Europe and the Americas. It is also agreed by both parties to handle the matter separately in accordance with the following sections: (1) Investigate where there are ships that can be purchased and are suitable for Party A's shipping needs. (2) Before purchasing all ships, the detailed condition, drawings, age, and lowest purchase price of the ship shall be sent to Party A for review. (3) All ships that have been reviewed and approved by Party A in accordance with Article 2 shall be purchased by Dollar Steamship Lines on behalf of the CMSNC, and the cost shall be recorded in Party A's debt account. (4) The actual price paid and all expenses incurred, including the expenses for each ship to sail to Shanghai or other ports in China for delivery, shall be verified and calculated separately. (5) All ship purchase contracts and related account documents shall be sent to Party A for verification and storage. (6) Party A shall pay Dollar Steamship Lines a commission of 1.25% based on the actual price of each ship as remuneration for the company's purchase of each ship on behalf of the company and for transporting the ship to China. (7) Before Party A has paid all the actual price, all expenses, and the 1.25% commission in full, Party A shall pay interest at the normal rate of 9% until the date of full payment. This interest shall be paid on the third month from the date of interest accrual. If the interest is not paid on time, compound interest shall be calculated at an annual rate of 9%. (8) Before Party A has paid the full price of the ships, the ownership of each ship shall belong to Dollar Steamship Lines, and each ship shall be supervised by Dollar Steamship Lines. (9) Dollar Steamship Lines shall send the detailed accounts of all expenses for each ship under its supervision, along with receipts, to Party A for verification and storage on a regular basis. (10) During the period of Dollar Steamship Lines' supervision of each ship, Party A shall have the right to use the ships separately for all commercial shipping purposes. (11) Before the price of the ship has been paid in full, each ship shall be registered in the United States and fly the American flag, but all national government restrictions on foreign merchants' merchant ships along the rivers and seas in foreign countries shall be waived. (12) All net income from each ship's business, excluding all expenses due to Party A, shall be paid to Dollar Steamship Lines in order to repay the price of the ship. (13) All income and payments related to each ship supplied under this contract shall be recorded separately in the account of each ship. These accounts shall be managed by qualified personnel, and these qualified personnel shall be recommended by Party B or Dollar Steamship Lines. (14) In order to increase the security of Party B and Dollar Steamship Lines, Party A is willing to submit all deeds or Chinese deeds of the wharves and real estate in various ports that have been mortgaged to HSBC to Party B or Dollar Steamship Lines for storage as additional collateral for the ship prices, expenses, and commissions paid by Party B on behalf of Party A.

<h3 id="e177">The Ministry of Finance Will Allocate Funds to Recover China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Shares <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Property Affairs Department has dispatched Cai Lisheng to take over.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Transportation announced the contract between the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's General Manager, Li Guojie, and Supervisor Chen Fumu, who were detained, and the American-owned China Trading Company to clarify the truth to the public. As for the recovery of state-owned shares, each set is valued at fifty taels. A share registration method has been drafted and ordered to be handled by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Board of Directors. The registration method is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Share Registration Method (Beijing Telegraph): After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is nationalized, the Ministry of Transportation will return commercial shares and has specifically formulated the following share registration methods: (1) Share registration for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be handled at the company's offices in Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. (2) All owners or pledgees of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shares should, within the period specified in Article 3, submit their shares to the designated China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for verification, fill out a registration application form according to the prescribed format, and apply for registration. If someone is entrusted to apply on their behalf, a letter of entrustment should also be attached. (3) The registration period is from December 1, 1932, to February 28, 1933. Those who fail to apply for registration within the deadline will have their shares invalidated. (4) A shareholder or pledgee must hold a full set of shares, as traditionally recognized by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is two navigation shares and one property share, to apply for registration. Those holding less than a full set of shares may combine with others to apply for registration. (5) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should provide receipts to applicants for the shares they submit for verification and record the applicant's name and receipt number on the back of the shares. The format of the receipt will be determined separately. (6) After the registration period expires, the Shanghai General Bureau of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will collect the application forms and shares from all locations, compare them with the share stubs, and conduct a detailed review. Those deemed authentic will have the "China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Verified" stamp affixed to the back of the shares and will be submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for announcement. The receipt number will be the same as in Article 7. The method of payment will be determined separately. (7) The price of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shares will be 50 taels of silver per set, according to the National Government's order. (8) China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shares cannot be transferred or registered under a new name after registration begins.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has Raised Funds (Beijing Telegraph): According to information from the Ministry of Transportation, the total face value of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shares is approximately 12 million, equivalent to 440 million. At 50 taels per set, a total of 2.2 million taels of cash is required. The Ministry of Finance has already raised the necessary funds and will issue payments according to value after the registration procedures are completed.</p>
<p>A Record of Gao Tingzi's Remarks (Beijing Telegraph): Gao Tingzi, Director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Transportation, stated that the four types of property mortgage contracts of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company involve a significant loss of navigation sovereignty. The government will definitely not recognize them, and they are purely the assertions of Li Guojie and others, and are naturally invalid according to the law. Although American merchants are unwilling to give up their vested rights, the Ministry of Transportation, in order to protect national rights, will first recover the four wharf properties and then negotiate with them based on reason. Chen Fumu and Li Guojie are jointly responsible for signing the contract. Minister Zhu has telegraphed Chen, instructing him to come to Beijing to explain the reasons. Chen has gone to Hong Kong, which shows his guilt. Li Guojie is under surveillance in Shanghai and has considerable freedom. Because the circumstances of this case are significant, it is necessary to investigate the inside story. If Mr. Li has no ambiguous behavior, would the government investigate an innocent person? As for the rumor that 700,000 has already been paid for the loan, the American merchants have not announced it. It will be checked by the Board of Directors when they audit the accounts. If it is true, it will be refunded in full.</p>
<p>Urging Chen Fumu to Come to Beijing (Beijing Telegraph): After the Ministry of Transportation publishes the share registration method for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, it will immediately telegraph Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the company, to establish a share registration office immediately. The registration office will publish a notice in the newspaper, informing all shareholders to come to the office to complete the registration in accordance with the regulations. Zhu Jiaju will also go to Shanghai on the 17th to explain various points to the American-owned China Trading Company and discuss with Song Ziwen, as well as with the General Manager, directors, and supervisors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, to prepare cash for the recovery of shares and other matters. Because the contract for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's property mortgage case was jointly signed by Chen Fumu and Li Guojie, Zhu Jiaju telegraphed Chen, instructing him to come to Beijing to answer questions. Chen telegraphed Zhu from Hong Kong on the 17th, only stating that there was nothing illegal about the contracts, and did not mention when he would come to Beijing. Li and Chen are the main persons responsible for signing the contract and cannot evade responsibility. Another telegram has been sent urging him to come quickly.</p>
<p>The Property Affairs Department Has Taken Over: General Manager Liu Hongsheng appointed Cai Lisheng as the director of the Property Affairs Department the day before yesterday. Director Cai went to take over at 1:00 PM, and the former director, Cheng Zhiyuan, handled the handover. Office operations resumed as usual yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Patrolman Injured, Rickshaw Driver Dies, Young Hostage Unharmed <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Gun battle with bandits on Jiangwan Road</p>
<p>Bandits fled in disarray after over ten minutes</p>
<p>Weng Kelong recounts his ordeal</p>
<p>Remarkably articulate and poised</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a kidnapping case occurred at the intersection of Qiwu Pu Road and Pingliang Road in Yangshupu. It was solved at the intersection of Xiangyin Road and Tiyu Hui Road in Jiangwan. Police and bandits exchanged more than 20 shots, injuring a patrolman. The hostage was rescued on the spot. The details of the investigation are described below:</p>
<p>One Person Got in the Car Midway: At 5:45 PM yesterday afternoon, two people suddenly arrived at the Donghai Motor Company on the west side of Daliang Wan Road, Pingliang Road. One of them, dressed in a gray cloth jacket and trousers and claiming to be Zhao Fulin, hired a car. The company assigned car number 17564 from the Concession and number 4420 from the Public Works Bureau to him, driven by the newly hired rickshaw driver Shen Xitang. They stated that they were going to the intersection of Longjiang Road and Qiwu Pu Road in Yangshupu. Halfway there, another person wearing a blue cloth jacket and trousers got into the car. When they reached Qiwu Pu Road, the three of them got out of the car together and told the rickshaw driver to drive the car to the intersection of Longjiang Road and wait for them. They then walked to the entrance of number 366, as if waiting for something.</p>
<p>Young Child Suddenly Snatched Away: Not long after, a young child walked out of number 366 and looked around outside the gate. At this time, the three bandits pulled out their pistols, stepped forward to scare the child into silence, and the one dressed in gray cloth jacket and trousers picked him up and put him in the car, threatening the rickshaw driver to drive quickly towards Jungong Road. At this time, the child's family had not yet found out. Later, after being told by neighbors, they urgently dispatched servants to search in all directions, but to no avail. They immediately went to the Yulin Road police station to report. The police station dispatched a large number of detectives by car to pursue them. After learning that the car had escaped in the direction of Jungong Road, they immediately notified the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which instructed the police stations in the five districts to pay attention through the Inspectorate.</p>
<p>Patrolman and Rickshaw Driver Injured: At around 7:30 PM, police officers from the Fifth Precinct, Fifth Sub-precinct police station in Jiangwan Tiyu Hui Road were inspecting pedestrians when a white-license taxi drove towards the intersection of Gongwan Road and Tiyu Hui Road on Xiangyin Road. The police officers stopped it for questioning as usual. Unexpectedly, the car suddenly fired two shots at the police officers. The police officers quickly returned fire, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle for about ten minutes. The occupants of the car ran out of bullets and took advantage of the chaos to get out of the car and escape east on Tiyu Hui Road. The police officers immediately chased after them bravely, but the area was remote, sparsely populated, and it was dark, so the bandits escaped. They returned to the original location and saw that Police Sergeant Liu Feizhi had been shot and was bleeding profusely. They quickly helped him into the station. Upon inspection of the car, they saw that the rickshaw driver had also been injured, so they pulled him out of the car and carried him into the station.</p>
<p>Young Hostage Unharmed: When Police Officers Jing Lun, Wu Wenxiang, Wang Xianming, and Guo Qingyun returned to the police station, they saw that a young child and a public bus driver were already in the station. After questioning, they learned that the young child was the hostage in the car. After the kidnappers got out of the car and fled, the child also got out of the car and ran wildly towards Jiangwan Road. Seeing a China Merchants First Road public bus coming towards him, he shouted for it to stop. The bus driver immediately stopped and asked for the reason. The child told him about his encounter with the kidnappers. The driver then took him back to the police station to report and asked for protection, thus clarifying the case.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Driver Dies from Severe Injuries: At this time, Dai Hongen, Chief of the Fifth Precinct, Fifth Sub-precinct, had arrived with a large number of armed police officers. After learning that the kidnappers had escaped east on Tiyu Hui Road, he urgently telephoned the neighboring precinct stations, instructing the officers on duty to pay attention, and also reported the progress of the case to the head office. He immediately sent the injured rickshaw driver Shen Xitang and the Police Sergeant Liu Feizhi, who was injured in the line of duty, to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. It was found that the rickshaw driver had been shot in the left chest, with the bullet exiting from his back. Due to excessive blood loss, he died before he could be treated. The hospital reported it to the police station, which sent it to the morgue for examination. Police Sergeant Liu was shot in the right shoulder, the bullet exiting, and he was not seriously injured and is still receiving treatment.</p>
<p>Young Child Details the Ordeal: After the reporter learned that the Fifth Sub-precinct had solved the case, he rushed to investigate. First, he went to the police station, where he saw a car parked at the intersection of Xiangyin Road and Tiyu Hui Road, with shards of glass all over the ground. There was a pool of blood on the seat in the driver's seat. There was a hole in the wall under the door of the police station, shot by the kidnappers. There was no other damage. He then learned that the hostage had been sent to the sub-precinct, so he went to the sub-precinct. On the way, he met Chief Dai escorting the hostage to his home to notify them and prevent them from being anxious. The reporter asked the child about his kidnapping experience by the side of the car, as described above. He also learned that the child's name was Weng Kelong, eleven years old, from Chaozhou. His father's name was Jingqing, and he ran several pawnshops and clothing stores in Shanghai. He was studying at the Shihua School. Last night, when he was having dinner, he saw a car parked at the door, thinking that a guest had arrived, so he went out to greet them. Unexpectedly, three men next to him picked him up and put him in the car. The bandits ordered the rickshaw driver to go to Jungong Road first, then ordered him to turn to Zhongshan Road. When crossing the new Zhongshan Road Bridge, another person wearing a blue cloth jacket and trousers got into the car and proceeded towards Xiangyin Road. When approaching the intersection of Tiyu Hui Road, when the police officers ordered the car to stop, the car stopped and the bandits ordered the rickshaw driver to drive quickly. The rickshaw driver ignored them. The bandits were in a hurry and opened fire. He (the child referred to himself) saw the bandits get out of the car and escape, so he got out of the car and called for help. The child stated that he saw a China Merchants First Road public bus coming towards him, so he shouted for it to stop. The bus driver immediately stopped and asked for the reason. The child told him about his encounter with the kidnappers. The driver then took him back to the police station to report and asked for protection. The child's articulation was exceptionally clear, and his attitude was calm. He was truly rare. The child is currently still in the Fifth Sub-precinct and will be sent to the head office today. After completing the procedures, he will be returned to his family.</p>
<h3 id="e183">A Great Tragedy: Fire in Taiyuan Lane, Zhabei <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>About Ten Men, Women, and Children Burned to Death</p>
<p>A total of twelve charred bodies have been recovered yesterday.</p>
<p>At 5:10 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the home of Shen Yuanxiang, who ran the Shen Rongji bookbinding shop, at number 34, Alley 3, Taiyuan Lane, Zhongxing Road, Zhabei. It destroyed a total of eight rooms in shikumen houses from number 33 to number 38, as well as one overhead building. Two of the houses were double-fronted. More than ten men, women, and children were burned to death. Twelve bodies were recovered yesterday. The details are described below:</p>
<p>The Rumor of the Fire: There are more than 70 houses in the area, which are owned by the Li family. They face south and back onto Zhongxing Road, with a large open space in the back. Most of the houses inside are rented to Anhui people who run weaving factories. Shen's house is in the last row in the middle. At about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the attic on the second floor of the house. There were as many as nine shop assistants living in the attic. According to an apprentice, the fire was caused by a shop assistant smoking and accidentally throwing the cigarette butt into a pile of paper. According to Zhu Xingsheng, a tenant living in the pavilion room of the house, the fire was caused by a kerosene lamp being knocked over in the second-floor attic.</p>
<p>The Course of the Fire: After the fire broke out, the northwest wind was very strong, and the neighbors were all asleep. Although Shen's shop assistants shouted loudly, they were unable to escape in time. Therefore, most of them were buried in the fire. Because none of the deceased have been claimed by their families, it is impossible to investigate their names, and even the exact number of dead and injured is unknown. However, the local headman, Wang Shaoting, sent people to collect the charred bodies all day yesterday. By the evening, a total of eleven charred bodies of men, women, and children had been collected. None of their limbs were intact. Some had intestines protruding, some had their skulls broken open, some were covered in blood, and some had no heads at all. The various tragic scenes were unbearable to witness. It was later learned that there were three children and nine adults, seven women and two men, among them. Gu, the wife of Zhu Xingsheng, a tenant in Shen's pavilion room, was 49 years old and from Suzhou. Shen's wife, Luo, was 37 years old, and her son, Wan Shun, was only ten years old. Also, the Li family of five, two men and three women, living in the three-story attic in the back, and the Wan couple, Anhui natives, who lived there as well, were all burned to death. The bodies were all placed in the open air. The local headman was busy examining the charred bodies yesterday and had not yet requested an examination. He will report to the Shanghai District Court today to request an autopsy. Shen Yuanxiang, 45 years old, from Zhenjiang, has been taken into custody by the Fourth Precinct Public Security Bureau pending investigation. According to an investigation by the Taiyang Temple Police Station of the Fourth Precinct Public Security Bureau, the property losses of the affected households were approximately 15,400 yuan, and the property losses were also over 15,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Beixin Bookstore Case Was Heard Yesterday <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Police Have Not Yet Decided Whether to Prosecute</p>
<p>According to the China Press, the Central Executive Yuan resolved to investigate the Beixin Bookstore in Shanghai for publishing words that insulted Islam. It has been heard that the Chinese authorities in Shanghai have discussed this matter with the Municipal Council because the Beixin Bookstore is located in the Concession. The First Special District Court sent an official document to the Police Department of the Municipal Council, requesting an investigation into the book. If the content is indeed contrary to the principle of freedom of belief, then the manager of the bookstore should be prosecuted. According to a certain police lawyer, although the Executive Yuan has issued an order to seal up the Beixin Bookstore, the official document from the First Special District Court did not ask the police to close the bookstore. As for whether the police should file a public prosecution against the bookstore, no decision has been made yet.</p>
<p>Lu Feibo Corrects His Remarks: The Shanghai Booksellers Association sent a letter to this newspaper regarding the Beixin Bookstore case. The reports in various newspapers in recent days have been quite inconsistent. Yesterday's Shenbao published Lu Feibo's remarks on the Beixin Bookstore case, which were based on an interview with a friend from a newspaper. However, the tone of what he recorded was slightly inaccurate. The corrections are as follows: (The other day, my old friend Mr. Huang told me that the Islamic leaders on Six Roads were powerful figures in various religions, so I sent a letter to arrange a meeting. Yesterday afternoon, I went to meet Chief Imam Ha Decheng. Chief Imam Ha said that this matter was not the concern of one mosque, but was presided over by the United Islamic Association. I said that I would send a letter to the association. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Chief Imam Ha sent a letter, instructing me not to send the letter. (The real situation of this first paragraph is that this was a private action and should not be published.) Some unscrupulous elements in the book industry publish books that are unsightly or print book samples and mail them to the interior. People in the interior send money to order, but often do not receive the books and often send letters to the Booksellers Association to inquire. When people are sent to investigate, there is no such store at the address. Therefore, the association recently published advertisements in various newspapers, instructing readers in the interior to inquire with the Booksellers Association if they have any doubts. (The fact in this second paragraph is a general discussion of the book industry situation. The Islamic community believes that the cartoon "Little Pig Eight Commandments" of the Beixin Bookstore is insulting. The book industry also expresses concern. Therefore, the Beixin Bookstore initially reported to the association, but the association did nothing, believing that under the rule of law, there should be a legal system to determine any guilt. Later, seeing the Executive Yuan's instructions, the book industry said that ordering the closure of the bookstore by administrative fiat rather than the law would put everyone in danger. On the one hand, the government should withdraw its order; on the other hand, it should present its case to the mayor and the government. But I felt that this matter would put both sides in a confrontational position, which would not be beneficial to anyone. Therefore, I ordered Beixin to send the book to the municipal government and apologize in the newspaper. On the one hand, I planned to ask the Islamic community to withdraw the request for a ban, seeking legal remedies instead. This would show the Islamic community's spirit of forgiveness and could save the government from sacrificing the rule of law. However, there are many mosques in Shanghai, and I did not know where to contact them, so I published my opinions in the newspaper, so that everyone could discuss the matter. The members of the association only seek to handle the matter according to the law and have no intention of supporting Beixin. This is the fact in the third paragraph.) The rumor that the police refused to enforce the ban was seen in the newspaper. The Booksellers Association did not participate. The rumor that the book industry went on strike to protest was also only seen in the newspaper. The Booksellers Association also did not know about it. (This last paragraph is the fact. I was seriously ill in the summer, and slightly better in the fall. I went to Tangshan for more than ten days to recuperate, and my health improved greatly. In recent days, my insomnia and diarrhea have returned. The doctor has ordered me to go out and rest. I will be leaving soon, and I will not be responsible for any reports in the newspapers in the future.]</p>
<h3 id="e185">Donations to the Northeast Volunteer Army - Yesterday's News <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, after many days of preparation for a fundraising event, has formally scheduled it for the 20th (Sunday) and 21st (Monday) of this month, to be held at the Tianchan Stage. Yesterday, theater tickets were sent to various sectors. A summary of letters and donations received by the association from various parties is recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding the Sending of Tickets: All directors, executive members, and custody committee members, as well as inspection committee members, a total of sixty-eight individuals, jointly signed and sent letters to various sectors with enclosed theater tickets. The letter stated: "Respectfully, since the brutal Japanese army occupied Shenyang and completely removed the defenses of Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Northern China, and the battle in Liaodong is in full swing, our patriotic warriors, holding weapons, build their homes, and are now enduring the ice and snow, dodging bullets under the forests, fighting the enemy empty-handed, and serving in the army with empty stomachs. How can we not be saddened and shed tears? We are fortunate to be in the safety of a paradise, but we empathize with the suffering of the soldiers. Lone armies are far away, traveling thousands of miles listening to the sound of battle drums. The troops have no supplies of food or clothing. The borderland is bitterly cold, and we plan to provide relief from behind. Ashamed of our limited abilities, we have consulted celebrities and amateur performers, noble members, to perform Peking Opera for two days at Tianchan Stage. Borrowing the costumes of actors, we break the illusion of puppets, not relying on sensual allure, appearing on stage, vowing to risk our ardent blood sincerity to eliminate the ominous signs. We hope that you, esteemed Gongjin (referring to someone with great understanding), know the music, or ladies, or business giants, instead of throwing money at empty courtesans, indulging in mere entertainment, why not donate to the volunteer army and enjoy the pleasure of watching the show? Drive from afar, come together, accumulate like tributaries, collect a thousand fox furs, and add a spoonful to the pot. Inspire patriotic feelings, hope for the example of sacrificing one's family. Not only will the Ling and Luo mules from Zhenshan comfort the Western soldiers, but the soldiers will also be fed and emboldened to strip the souls of the Eastern barbarians."</p>

Recently, she felt that the Northeast Volunteer Army was fighting against the Japanese army with bloodshed and was in dire need of supplies, so she decided to auction off the above-mentioned property and donate all the proceeds to</p>

Recently, as the weather has turned cold, the company staff, in view of the Northeast Volunteer Army's hard fighting in the ice and snow and their urgent need for relief, initiated a monthly donation system. The entire staff saved on expenses and raised forty yuan. This month is the first time, and thereafter it will continue monthly until the lost territory in the Northeast is recovered. This monthly donation system has been implemented in several companies and is indeed a powerful support for long-term resistance. It is hoped that all industrial and commercial enterprises across the country will take action and implement it, so that the goal of saving the country and avenging the humiliation can be achieved.</p>

Due to the pressure of his duties, he only occasionally does it in his spare time to serve the world. In view of the Northeast Volunteer Army's bloody battle against the enemy in the ice and snow, he is taking advantage of weekend holidays to work hard and carve meticulously, especially offering discounted prices, and donating half of the profits to help the volunteer army.</p>
<p>The Capital Holds a Variety Show to Raise Funds: The Capital China National Salvation Volunteer Army Support Association, in view of the Northeast Volunteer Army's urgent need for support, specially invited various artistic groups in the capital to hold a variety show on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of this month. The proceeds from the ticket sales, after deducting necessary expenses, will be used entirely to help the volunteer army. Representatives Ma Kui, Liu Piguang, Zhang Chuyu, etc., stationed in Shanghai on behalf of various anti-Japanese volunteer armies in the Northeast, specially sent representative Yang Yijie to Beijing to contact the association and report on the latest situation, requesting their assistance. The representative returned to Shanghai yesterday morning and said that the association's variety show to aid the Northeast anti-Japanese armies was very enthusiastic, with nearly ten thousand people attending. The local public sentiment can be generally seen from this. The ticket sales revenue has not yet been fully collected. After it is collected, the association plans to provide three thousand yuan in assistance, and the rest will be remitted to the front lines. The author informed them that what the front lines need are cotton clothes and ammunition, not money, so please provide material assistance. The association immediately agreed to do so. After it is done, they will inform the Joint Communication Office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies in this port, and then the Communication Office will inform the various armies on the front lines of the latest battle locations, so that they can be practically assisted. The representative will go north within a week, and the affairs in Shanghai will be handled by staff member Cao Fengchun.</p>
<p>The Joint Communication Office Informs All Sectors: The Joint Communication Office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies stationed in Shanghai sent a letter to various organizations at home and abroad yesterday, stating: "Respectfully, since the fall of the Northeast, a year has passed in an instant. Fortunately, our anti-Japanese generals and volunteer armies in various places have been fighting jointly for a year, fighting bloody battles and moving between the White Mountains and Black Waters, making the Japanese army exhausted and restless. Aroused by righteous indignation or alarmed by the fall of the country, the people have risen up to contribute and eagerly inquire. However, the representatives of the armies arriving in Shanghai lack organization, causing various difficulties. After many days of preparation, the Joint Communication Office of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Armies in Shanghai was established on November 15th. In addition to publishing the battle situation on the front lines of various armies in newspapers at any time, any donations or inquiries are welcome. We hope for your assistance to help us achieve our goals. We are very fortunate."</p>

<h3 id="e188">Tianlun Silk Weaving Factory Suddenly Suspends Work Yesterday <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Conflicts Erupt Between Day and Night Shift Workers</p>
<p>The Social Bureau Will Send Personnel to Mediate</p>
<p>The Tianlun Silk Weaving Factory in Mingyuanfang, Huade Road, recently suffered from poor business and switched to using inferior raw materials to reduce costs. However, the workers believed that these raw materials were difficult to spin and weave and demanded subsidies for food expenses. The factory owner refused to comply, resulting in a dispute. The Social Bureau sent Chen [illegible] Shan to mediate, but the matter has not been resolved. Last night, the factory manager, Fang Dehua, suddenly announced the temporary suspension of the night shift, but did not notify any workers to stop working or disperse. Therefore, when they went to work yesterday morning, the day and night shift workers went to work at the same time, and both sides competed for work, resulting in a conflict. Seeing that the labor situation was not good, the factory closed the electric motors, drove the workers out of the factory, and announced a temporary shutdown of all workers. The workers immediately reported to the Silk Weaving Industry Union of the Fourth District. The executive director, Wei Shouchang, filed a petition and went to the Social Bureau with Fang Shaofu and other representatives of the factory workers. Chen Yushan of the Third Section of the Bureau came out to receive them and promised to negotiate with the factory immediately, ordering them to resume work as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Seven Russians Risk Escape from Vladivostok and Arrive in Shanghai <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Vladivostok: Recently, seven Russians, disgusted with the communist regime, escaped from Vladivostok on a small gasoline-powered boat. After sailing for fifteen days, they arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday. The boat is named "Sakudo" and is now docked in Pudong, not far from Lujiazui. The reporter (16th) inspected the boat yesterday and saw the traces of storms in the Sea of Japan. The boat belongs to the seven people. Except for the boat owner and the mechanic, who are both around 45 years old, the rest are young people. It is said that they set sail from Vladivostok on the 31st of last month, pretending to be fishing as usual, only taking extra gasoline and food. When they sailed into the sea and escaped the patrol boats of the Russian authorities, they encountered two major storms. A huge amount of seawater poured into the cabin, but the boat was strong and remained safe. The engines did not cause any problems. They then rounded the southern tip of Korea, passed Jeju Island, and went straight to the Yangtze River. They had no nautical charts and relied only on ordinary maps to navigate. After entering the Wusongkou, they were inspected by customs and were allowed to enter the port. On Tuesday night, they sailed to Pudong and docked. The people were very happy to arrive in Shanghai. Their future plans are still undecided, and they urgently hope to find work to make a living. They also hope to sell or rent out the boat. According to them, the situation in Vladivostok this year is worse than last year. Everyone has to work, and no one is spared from hunger and cold. The fish caught by fishermen are bought by the authorities at government-set prices and given receipts. Foreign tourists have special stores that supply foreigners with goods in exchange for money. Overseas Chinese buy goods from these stores and secretly resell them, making huge profits. If they are caught, they can only eat cheap fish and vegetables, and there is no meat. It is said that it is difficult to find any internal goods in Vladivostok.</p>
<h3 id="e190">The Completion of the Four Virtues Hall in Mr. Huang's Villa is a Grand Event <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Reception for All Sectors Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The news that Mr. Huang Jinrong's villa will be open to visitors from all walks of life today and tomorrow has already been reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday, around 11:00 AM, the completion ceremony of the Four Virtues Hall was held, with more than a thousand people attending. They gathered in the hall and performed the ceremony as usual. First, Mr. Huang gave a speech, followed by Mr. Lai Bao, representing Mr. Wang Boling, giving a speech. Finally, Mr. Wang Zhongxian gave a reply on behalf of the students. The ceremony ended at 12:00 PM, followed by a meal together, where they toasted and celebrated in a joyful atmosphere. It was truly a grand gathering on the beach. After the meal, they visited the garden and took a group photo to commemorate the occasion. The full text of the speeches and the Four Virtues Hall inscription are extracted below.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang's Speech: Briefly, "I have served in Shanghai for more than forty years, and I have been fortunate to receive the love and mutual assistance of people from all walks of life. I am fortunate not to have failed. The reason why I have been able to gain a slight position in society is only because of the two principles of hard work and loyalty. Do not seek help from others for things that you can do yourself. Do not leave things that can be completed today for tomorrow. My life has come from hard work. If you treat others with sincerity, they will repay you with sincerity. Although your positions may be different, whether you are in government or in business, the way of dealing with people is the same. If you can discipline yourself with hard work and treat others with sincerity, you will be able to achieve success. I am now sixty-five years old, and although my energy is still strong, I feel that it is not as good as before. Society is becoming increasingly complex. I feel that I am old and incompetent and cannot bear the heavy responsibilities. The country is in a time of great difficulty, and great disasters will come in the future. The heavy responsibilities in the future depend on you young people. I have long wanted to retire, reflect on my mistakes, and return to my original state. Therefore, I built several rooms next to the family shrine and slightly decorated them to relieve my mind and avoid worldly affairs. I am grateful to you for donating to build this hall to commemorate me. It is named 'Four Virtues'. Who am I to dare to admire the sages? I only wish to encourage you to practice the four virtues of literature, conduct, loyalty, and trustworthiness."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Speech: "Today, we are participating in the celebration of the completion ceremony, and we are very happy. This is the crystallization of Mr. Jinrong's life's work, and it is worthy of admiration and respect. What I heard from Mr. Jinrong just now can indeed be our guide in dealing with the world, but from an objective point of view, there are many more virtues that he possesses. From my personal point of view, the first is moral sentiment. He treats the world with sincerity, without deception or suspicion, whether they are rich or powerful, or without money or power. He is different from those who are snobbish and opportunistic. This is one. The second is his humble attitude. Mr. Jinrong is always humble in dealing with people, not only to his superiors, but also to his subordinates. He is different from those who fawn on their superiors and are arrogant to their inferiors. This is the second. The third is his equal attitude. He treats everyone equally, regardless of their status. Others make friends by strictly distinguishing social classes. Mr. Jinrong makes friends with everyone, from government officials to laborers, treating them equally. This is the third. The fourth is his compassionate heart. He is always willing to help those who are in need, taking their difficulties as his own. Other good deeds, such as disaster relief, poverty relief, and orphan care, are well known and cannot be fully described. This is the fourth. The fifth is his frugal virtue. People see that his life is already comfortable and luxurious, but he is not like that. He cherishes material resources and is frugal in his self-indulgence. He never throws away half-smoked cigarettes and does not use fine leather for his fur coats. This is the fifth. The sixth is his courageous demeanor. He has served in society and in the French Concession police force for decades, and he has always used his intelligence and courage to solve difficult and dangerous cases. This is the sixth. The seventh is his regular routine. Most people living in Shanghai work day and night and have irregular routines, but Mr. Jinrong, both during and after his work, has never gotten out of bed later than eight o'clock in the morning. He has fixed times for lunch and dinner. I have lived with him for seven or eight years and have never seen him change his routine. This is the seventh. The eighth is his wise vision. His vision is sharp and unparalleled, not even comparable to that of politicians. Moreover, his will is very firm. In the past two or three years, the atmosphere in Shanghai has changed almost constantly, but Mr. Jinrong has always used his sincere heart to support the truth that should be supported. This kind of understanding is truly wise and worthy of our admiration. This is the eighth. Based on the above points, which are only my personal, one-sided understanding, there are many more good qualities that I do not know about, but these few points are enough to make his life a success. I am fortunate to be at the end of the list and to participate in this grand ceremony. I am very happy. These few words cannot express even a fraction of my feelings. I am truly ashamed."</p>
<p>Inscription of the Four Virtues Hall: "Mr. Jinrong, a master of ethics, hails from the Huang clan of Yuyao. His pure and harmonious virtue has been evident since childhood, and his outstanding talent shines brightly in the world. Since residing in Shanghai, he has been encouraging the promotion of norms, emulating Lu Lian in resolving disputes and Lord Mengchang in valuing righteousness. His fame and reputation have spread far and wide. In the spring of Jiazi, he built a family shrine at Jihejing in western Shanghai. He sincerely performs sacrifices to his ancestors to fulfill his filial piety and promote good customs. The empty space next to the shrine violates the principles of feng shui, so he transformed it into a garden with flowing springs and stacked rocks, where beautiful plants grow luxuriantly. In his leisure time, he often rests there with his students, creating a joyful atmosphere like the spring breeze of the Yi River. The master once said: 'Confucius used literature, conduct, loyalty, and trustworthiness to educate his three thousand disciples. I have been reading the Analects since I was young and admire these words. I encourage you to strive for these virtues together.' The students respectfully retreated and reflected on his words. Without literature and conduct, one cannot develop talent; without loyalty and trustworthiness, one cannot achieve virtue. They said, 'Though we are not smart, we will strive to do these things.' Therefore, they raised funds to build a hall in the eastern corner of the garden and named it 'Four Virtues'. Now, the chairman of the National Government, General Chiang Kai-shek, has gladly written a plaque for it. At the time of the completion, the students raised their cups and ascended the hall. They saw the newness of the halls and the permanence of the model. They were delighted and danced, expressing their feelings in words and songs, praising: 'Yinishan established the teachings, with literature, conduct, loyalty, and trustworthiness. Since the style has declined, who will gather the remnants? The master alone holds on to these words and teaches us earnestly. The hall is solemn, and the flowers and bamboo exude their fragrance. Please take this hall as a reminder to strive for the refinement of virtue. O master, master, why not drink first from this brewed wine, enjoying this joy?'"</p>

The most important thing is national martial arts and physical education. The way to defend ourselves is to strengthen our bodies first. If our bodies are strong, we can defend ourselves. Even if foreign insults come frequently, what is there to fear? Therefore, compatriots who want to strengthen their bodies should diligently engage in physical education and master national martial arts.</p>
<p>Only then can we resist foreign insults and wash away the shame of the 'Sick Man of East Asia.'" It is also heard that Mr. Zhang is scheduled to lecture on Christianity at the same pharmaceutical company's radio station on December 18th.</p>

<p>Huada Music Store, located on the fifth floor of the Continental Emporium in this city, is the distributor of Lion Brand beef and chicken extract from the German Martha Pharmaceutical Factory. It has a very good reputation and is considered a leading tonic, so its business is exceptionally prosperous. Unexpectedly, recently, fake goods have appeared on the market. Three weeks ago, a customer who regularly consumed Lion Brand beef extract brought in a bottle and questioned why the taste had changed recently and the effectiveness was much worse than before. The store staff did not know it was fake, so they exchanged it for a new bottle. That evening, manager Cao Mengdao went to the store and noticed that the counterfeit product had the Chinese characters on the left and the English characters on the right, while the genuine product had the Chinese characters on the left and the English characters on the right. The strokes of the characters were also different and easily identifiable. Last Saturday, they discovered that a certain company had also imported five dozen counterfeit products, with a purchase price much lower than the genuine product. When they inquired with the company, they learned that the seller was Junxiang De Kee Trading Company and produced an invoice. Huada then reported this to the general patrol police station on Simalu (4th Avenue). Since it was a Saturday, the station was not open for official business. On Monday, they requested a search warrant from the court. The police station, along with Russian detective and Chinese detective Zhao Datong, notified Huada to send someone to accompany them to search the Junxiang De Kee Trading Company on Dongqi Grist Street. They found thirteen and a half batches of counterfeit goods. When asked where they came from, they said they were purchased from a certain large pharmacy on 日大馬路 (Rida Malu) [Japanese Great Road] and produced an invoice. The two detectives then went to the pharmacy, which claimed it was purchased from the Zhiwei Pharmacy on 英華街 (Yinghua Street) [English China Street] and also produced an invoice. Upon inspecting the ledger, it showed that they had imported 25 dozen. Then, they went to the Zhiwei Pharmacy for investigation, and only found seven bottles. They asked where the manager was, but the pharmacy claimed that manager Tao Muju had gone to 前途 (Qiántú) to negotiate the beef extract matter. When they went again in the evening, there was an invoice issued by the Shengli Company, showing that they had imported more than 150 dozen, with the address at No. 15 Fuchang Lane, Xixin Bridge. The peddler was Zhang Ruichen, a Ningbo native who was a salesman for the Huasheng Company, which sells Dali Brand beef and chicken extract. The two detectives went to Fuchang Lane, but there was no No. 15. They went to search Zhang Ruichen's home, but Zhang had already fled with his family after hearing the news. The police station believes the Zhiwei Pharmacy is highly suspicious. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated to the court that they were preparing to file a public prosecution. The court approved the request and summoned Tao Muju, manager of the Zhiwei Pharmacy, to court for further investigation. The case was then postponed. It is heard that Huada Pharmacy has suffered enormous losses due to the counterfeiting and has engaged lawyer Yuan Yangan to file a criminal complaint with an attached private prosecution.</p>

<p>The Laoda Fang Tea and Food Shop in the southern part of Shanghai, Penglai Market, was originally established by Kuang Zhongmou and Qian and others. Since its opening, business has been lackluster. Mr. Kuang therefore had no intention of continuing to operate it, so he transferred it to Jiang Qiunong in the old summer and changed the brand name to Qiuji to continue operating it. The business is developing day by day. Seeing that the area around Ma Huo and Dagu Road is densely populated, there are no food stores established, so a branch store was established at the intersection of Laoda Dagu Road, which is officially opened today, holding a large sale for three weeks, with discounts ranging from 10% to 30%. It also exclusively manages two kinds of Yantai domestic brandy and red and white wine, which are characterized by low prices.

<h3 id="e215">The Issue of Public Childcare <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Pinglin</p>
<p>The issue of public childcare is the most essential issue for female emancipation and equal opportunity. Because if we don't pay attention to the issue of public childcare, even though women can leave their families and work in society, for women who have given birth, it goes without saying that they must shoulder the responsibility of raising their children at home because they cannot abandon them. Or, as some say, "The calls for women's employment are growing louder every day. Even the wives and daughters of big shots are condescending to serve society... There are female staff members, female section chiefs, female judges, female county magistrates, female secretaries in various departments, female clerks in shops and banks, female hostesses in amusement parks and restaurants, female nurses in hospitals, female teachers and staff in schools, female workers in factories... all these people are taking over the positions of men... At that time, cooking, washing clothes, and taking care of children at home will be the work of men. Otherwise, it will not be too late to promote male employment." Indeed, that is not wrong at all. But we only know that when women work in society, the thousands of years of women taking care of domestic affairs will be handed over to men. Then, wouldn't men be doing women's work and women doing men's work, exchanging like this? I am afraid that in the future, men will also demand the promotion of employment like women do now. In fact, it is not such a cycle.</p>
<p>Because society is composed of human beings, and since women are human beings, and their intelligence and physical strength are not much different from men, why should they depend on men and live a life of slavery? Therefore, women should go to society to support themselves and achieve the principle of gender equality. Men should work hard in society as much as possible and do not need to wash clothes, cook, and take care of children at home. Break the inherent family form and make a living separately (this refers to unmarried women). For women who have given birth, of course, it is impossible. In this situation, we can only advocate public childcare. Where there is public childcare, women who work in society will not be able to raise their children at home, and it will never affect the healthy development of their children! Because to organize public childcare, of course, we need specialists who are good at teaching and raising children to do it. We teach and raise children according to the principle of division of labor, so that children's moral, intellectual, and physical education can develop in parallel, and the effect will definitely be better than the old style of relying solely on the mother for life. With this kind of public childcare organization, women can achieve their true liberation. Although this is the current ideal, the trend of facts will eventually be realized one day. People should no longer hold the bad idea that men are superior to women, purely take individuals as units, men and women should develop in parallel, and work together in various careers. Men do not need to fear that their positions will be taken by women, and there will be a day to promote men's employment.</p>

<p>— Yi Bingchu</p>
<p>Having seen the vicissitudes of life is this tower, do not record the years in spring and autumn. I only hear the sound of drums and horns filling Zhongshan, and still hear the song of water chestnuts sung by Mo Chou. The color of the sea enters from beyond the sky, and the rosy light floats near in the water. Where do the lonely fishermen return? Let's learn from the gulls on the river who avoid the trap.</p>
<p>Inscription on a Tiger Painting (Tune: Lang Tao Sha) by Bao Zengyu The roar shakes the forest, and all beasts are frightened. Steel teeth and iron claws are sharper than knives. Drinking and eating as they please, the weak fill the kitchen. Devouring wantonly does not last all morning. The lessons of Yin are clear. The drums of Liaoyang resound in the battle. Struggling to put all one's eggs in one basket, the hot blood flows torrentially.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Research on Sea Sponges <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Shunji</p>
<p>……Small Knowledge One……</p>
<p>The nature of sea sponges The other name for sea sponges is haimian, which is a type of sponge animal. They grow at the bottom of the sea, and their roots also grow on the surface of rocks... When the sea sponge is alive, there must be flesh attached to it, like a kind of soft paste... When we cut it off from the water, there is nothing attached to it, only a solid, elastic, and porous skeleton body.</p>
<p>The Life of Sea Sponges The pores in the sea sponge are mostly the mouths of the sea sponge. When water passes through the many crevices of the sea sponge, the food in the water is sent into the small holes, and then the small holes contract; they send the water out again, and when sending the water out, it passes through the large holes in the sea sponge... Food with nourishing nutrients in the water is preserved, and if there is no nourishing food, it is sent out with the water. This is probably the situation of the life of sea sponges at the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>How to Get Sea Sponges Sea sponges grow at the bottom of the sea, but how do we get them? There is a kind of person who specializes in collecting sea sponges, and we call them sea sponge collectors. They have been practicing collecting sea sponges since they were children. When they want to collect sea sponges, they ride in a small boat to the middle of the sea... They take a large stone and tie it to their feet, tie a rope around their body, surround their neck with a large bag for collecting sea sponges, and hold a long and very sharp knife in their hand. When they are all prepared, they immediately jump into the water and go straight to the bottom of the sea. They begin their work, cutting off... as much as they can cut off, and then put it in the large bag hanging around their neck. After cutting it, they immediately climb up, but when they are at the bottom of the sea, they cannot stay for more than three minutes, because if they stay for more than three minutes, they may drown. We see how terrible the livelihood of sea sponge collectors is! The Use of Sea Sponges Because sea sponges are porous, elastic, soft, and smooth, we use them to wash away the dirty things rotting in the skin, which is their best use.</p>

<p>— Chen Zhou</p>
<p>It seems it's not only Chinese teachers who are like this. As the bold articles published in this journal about their sketches say, English teachers can sometimes be even more ridiculous and pathetic, especially blue-eyed, blonde-haired teachers. MissCry, mentioned in this article, is a good example.</p>
<p>She is a foreigner, a graduate of some second-rate university in the ancient country, and although she already had a fiancé, because both families were poor, they could not marry immediately. She had no choice but to leave her lover and her beloved hometown, cross the Pacific Ocean, and come to this open trading port in East Asia: Shanghai. Relying on her being a foreigner, she was introduced by a friend to work as an English teacher in our school, preparing to earn some money and save up for their wedding expenses. She really deserves to be pitied! But the students couldn't sympathize with her, always messing around and talking nonsense, saying her teaching methods were bad, and her textbooks were bad. In fact, this was all the idea of the head of the English department. She wanted to change the teaching methods and textbooks, but the head of the English department didn't agree. Seeing that she wasn't changing the teaching methods and textbooks, the students completely ignored her in class, letting her ask questions and seek answers, but always ignoring her. She had no choice but to cry, crying in front of the students. Sometimes she got angry and said she wouldn't teach us anymore, so she would leave before the end of class.</p>
<p>But the next day, she still came to class and, with tears in her eyes, urged us not to treat her like this again.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Yes, good students, after hearing this, would definitely not treat her like this again, at least thinking of her plight and showing some pity, being quieter in class. But unfortunately, she encountered this kind of student. The more she treated the students this way, the more the students saw her as a pushover, easy to bully. Like this, once, twice, three times... The students made trouble, she cried. She really had no way. Perhaps she was complaining about her bitter fate. Sometimes, when she talked about, or thought about, her</p>
<p>fiancé, she couldn't help but wail and cry. Finally, because she cried, the students gave her the nickname MissCry. In reality, the MissCry I mentioned above is not her real name.</p>
<p>Like this, autumn passed and spring came, and she, who washed her face with tears every day, had lived in our school for two years. After the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, she expressed her sympathy to us, saying, "Children, you are now trying to solve problems that adults cannot solve. I am very willing to help you. If you need me anywhere..." Sure enough, one day, about a few days before Christmas, she asked each of us to write a letter detailing the actual situation of the Japanese invasion of the Northeast, and also writing a request for some help or sympathy for us, and it would be even better if we could boycott Japanese goods! She attached these letters to her New Year's cards sent to friends and relatives in America. She said, "This way, my friends and relatives can understand the truth about this Japanese invasion of the East, and through this, one person can tell ten, ten can tell a hundred... perhaps we can get some small help!" Naturally, although this is trivial, it is also a kind of international propaganda. On this point, I express my respect and gratitude to Miss Cry!</p>
<p>Then, the January 28th Incident broke out, and she went home at that time. It is said that she is now married to her fiancé and living together!</p>
<p>Such a Family</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Heritage of a Pest <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yu</p>
<p>Zhen, whom I hadn't seen for two years, suddenly came as an uninvited guest yesterday. Xiu Mei was delighted to reminisce with her, but she sighed with a frown: "The world is changing, and fortune and misfortune are unpredictable. In these three years, I have experienced family disasters and suffered hardship. If I hadn't acquired these meager knowledge in school back then, relying on teaching to make a living, I would have become a starving corpse by now!"</p>
<p>Xiu Mei asked suspiciously, "Didn't your late father leave a lot of inheritance? Why would you suffer so much?" She said hatefully, "It is precisely because of those many inheritances that I feel endless pain in my spirit. Alas! If my late father could have kindly distributed his wealth and used it for public welfare, instead of leaving behind these pestilent inheritances, then my two wise and promising elder brothers might not have degenerated like this, and my happy family wouldn't have fallen to this point! Speaking of it, it's truly heartbreaking. Before father's bones were cold, my second brother and elder brother started arguing over the property, causing deep-seated opinions.</p>
<p>The reason is that my elder brother has always been a bookkeeper in a money shop in Beiping, with limited monthly income, so after my father died, my mother ordered my elder brother to take care of the family affairs at home, to avoid traveling from afar, since the family had to manage the fields and rent accounts anyway.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, my second brother suddenly quit his job at the Tianjin Bank for no reason and came home, saying, "Everyone has a share in father's inheritance. Now that elder brother is leisurely at home as a young master, I don't want to hold someone else's rice bowl either, so let's come and manage the family affairs together."</p>
<p>From then on, my elder brother and second brother had to compare everything and make sure everything was the same. For example, if my elder brother made a fox fur coat worth two hundred yuan, my second brother had to make one of the same value, not even one cent less than ninety-nine yuan.</p>
<p>Not only were my elder brother and second brother like this, but my elder sister-in-law and second sister-in-law were also like this. They compared clothes and jewelry piece by piece, and even with trivial things like socks, they haggled over every detail, absolutely unwilling to be careless.</p>
<p>When my father was alive, after each autumn harvest, he would routinely go to the countryside to collect rent. Now my elder brother said, "I'm not used to the desolate life in the countryside," and didn't want to go. My second brother was afraid that if he went, my elder brother would be at home feasting and making merry, so he didn't want to go either.</p>
<p>As a result, they would rather take out money and hire someone else to go, rather let others embezzle, but not let their own compatriots benefit! My elder brother loved to drink brandy the most. With a glass in hand, he didn't care about anything. Although my second brother didn't want him to enjoy the benefits alone, he hated that he couldn't handle alcohol and would get drunk after drinking.</p>
<p>My second brother hated it so much that his teeth itched, saying, "You drink fine wine, and I'll smoke opium." He bought a very exquisite opium smoking set and spent all day indulging in smoke. At first, he just wanted to vent his anger, just smoking for fun, but after smoking for two or three months, he gradually turned pretense into reality and became addicted, unable to stop.</p>
<p>My elder brother certainly wouldn't show weakness, so the two brothers lay side by side, filling the room with black smoke, and finally my elder brother also became addicted to opium.</p>
<p>They turned day into night, reversing morning and evening, and sank into the underworld. Not only did they leave the affairs of the fields and rent to others, but they also didn't care about the shop affairs of the exclusive shares opened at my home, letting those handlers steal and embezzle everything. This year, they even caused the two cloth shops that my parents had painstakingly created to lose two or three hundred thousand yuan and go bankrupt.</p>
<p>The fields and houses had also long been sold by my two "inseparable" elder brothers for consumption. Alas! A good family has now been reduced to such a ruin. Speaking of it, it's so heartbreaking..." Zhen choked up and couldn't continue speaking.</p>
<p>Dead End</p>
<h3 id="e221">Selling Books <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>He quickly packed a large bundle of books.</p>
<p>His heart seemed to feel a surge of sadness, feeling that he had really fallen too low; even these books that he usually cherished like his life had to be sent to the used bookstore.</p>
<p>As he ran out of the dormitory with this large bundle of books, the landlady happened to be standing at the door, looking him up and down with some curiosity. He hurriedly lowered his head, didn't greet her, and rushed past.</p>
<p>Walking onto the road, the piercingly cold wind blew on him. He felt extremely cold, and his body trembled. However, he just silently walked, carrying the books. The road was crowded with people, jostling and clamoring. Trams and cars, rickshaws sped past, but it seemed that he had no feelings about any of it. Walking to the entrance of a used bookstore, he saw the sign for buying used books in the dim light. He was just about to go in, but he immediately backed out. He felt that going into a used bookstore to sell books was a shameful, degenerate act. He pulled down his hat and still hesitated at the entrance of the bookstore, hesitating to go in.</p>
<p>"I didn't steal someone else's books to sell. I'm taking my own beloved old books to sell. This is a legitimate and honorable act. What's there to be ashamed of? Go in! To solve my own livelihood problems, I have no choice but to do this. Gather your courage and go in!" He pulled his hat down to his eyebrows and finally walked into the door.</p>
<p>"Sir! What books do you want to buy?"</p>
<p>"No, I have a few old books. Please see if you want them?" He forced himself to say a few words. "How much do you want?" A clerk walked over, flipped through a few books, and gave him a disdainful look, asking lazily.</p>
<p>"You tell me!"</p>
<p>"No, it's your stuff, you should say it yourself."</p>
<p>"Five yuan!" Seeing the fellow's disdainful and dismissive attitude, he didn't dare to ask for more.</p>
<p>"No," the clerk said bluntly.</p>
<p>"According to you, how much is it worth?"</p>
<p>"One yuan!"</p>
<p>He was so frightened that he almost jumped up, wanting to slap the clerk heavily. Books worth ten yuan are only worth one yuan! This is really a joke. He probably thinks these books were stolen from someone else's house! Even if I'm destitute, I can't auction them off at such a low price. When I bought them back then, it took a lot of effort to get them.</p>
<p>"So cheap? At least three yuan..."</p>
<p>"No!" The clerk turned around and walked away with a disapproving look.</p>
<p>He angrily left the bookstore, feeling extremely humiliated. A ball of angry flames was burning fiercely in his heart, as he walked with a large bundle of books in the bustling street.</p>

<h3 id="e222">The Same Hopelessness <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Han Gu Nong, a Thirteen-Year-Old Elementary School Student</p>
<p>The autumn wind blew through the withered treetops, making rustling sounds. At this time, the rice in the fields had all been harvested, and the village was filled with the sound of threshing rice. It was the time of the autumn harvest. In a corner of this village, there was a thatched cottage, the house of tenant farmer Zhang San. At this time, there were three children, asking Zhang San. One was about thirteen or fourteen years old, and the other was about six or seven years old, probably his sons. They had returned from the fields and were making requests to their father.</p>
<p>"Dad! It's time to buy me new clothes. Li Rongguan, from the landlord's family in the next village, is already wearing his new clothes," said the thirteen or fourteen-year-old son, looking at his father.</p>
<p>"Dad! When will you buy me the little foreign doll in the foreign goods store on the street?" The six or seven-year-old child also shouted.</p>
<p>"Children! Don't make a fuss! Where do we have the money to buy luxury goods?" the father said heavily, sighing.</p>
<p>"Father, didn't we harvest a lot of rice? Sell it and we'll have a lot of money," asked the older child in disbelief.</p>
<p>"We still have to pay rent, and we still have to pay back the money we owe people. And this year there's a war, and our cattle were taken away by the army. We haven't paid off the money yet," the old farmer explained to the two children in detail.</p>
<p>"I want a foreign doll... I want new clothes too. Anyway, we had a good harvest this year, right?" the children still pleaded.</p>
<p>"Although the harvest was good this year, we harvested three stones per mu, but because the harvest was good, we couldn't sell it for a good price, only selling for six or seven yuan per stone. In terms of calculation, it's not as good as the flood last year. Alas! Only those who do business make money. Where do I have the money to buy you these things? Look! How many holes are there in the clothes I'm wearing?"</p>
<p>"Why is that Li Rongguan dressed so beautifully, but we don't have anything?"</p>
<p>"Because they have money and property, so they have everything."</p>
<p>"If they have money, why do they still want us to pay them rent?"</p>
<p>"Don't say too much. It's getting late, you should quickly take the cattle to graze. We'll buy you your things when the harvest is better next year!"</p>
<p>"A better harvest, isn't it still the same hopelessness!"</p>
<p>The child said…</p>

<h3 id="e223">The Beginning of Cinema <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Fo</p>
<p>Cinema originated in the West. The Book of Han records that Emperor Wu's concubine, Lady Li, passed away, and the Emperor was deeply saddened. A Taoist magician from Qi, Shao Weng, claimed he could summon her spirit. He set up lamps and candles at night, arranged curtains and tents, and displayed wine and meat, while having the Emperor reside in another tent. From afar, he could see a beautiful woman resembling Lady Li, returning to the tent, sitting and walking; but he could not approach and see her clearly. The Emperor became more and more reminiscent and sad, composing a poem saying, "Is it her? Is it not her? Standing and gazing, why is she so slow to come!" He ordered the musicians of the Music Bureau to sing it. Later, Emperor Wu wrote an ode mourning Lady Li, saying, "…her demeanor graceful and elegant, drifting and swaying, becoming more dignified; gracefully leaning and touching the pillars, continuously glancing with beautiful eyes." All these describe the forms seen in a trance. Today's cinema is just like that. The Records of the Capital City state that shadow plays were initially made by people in the capital using plain paper carvings, later using colored leather. The loyal were carved with righteous faces, and the treacherous with ugly faces. This is similar to the making of lantern shadows. From this perspective, could cinema have originated in our country?</p>
<p>Sound cinema was invented by the American Edison, making rapid progress to what it is today. We cannot but admire the Westerners' rapid progress in creating and improving any undertaking. I remember when cinema in Shanghai was not yet developed, and the films shown were very childish. Now, movie theaters stand in rows, not inferior to those in the West, and the films shown are mostly new releases. Shanghai is truly the second Paris! Even in terms of domestic films, although they cannot compare with foreign ones, the speed of progress is truly amazing. Who wouldn't call it a good phenomenon?</p>
<p>Since we cannot travel around the world to broaden our horizons, the only remedy is to watch movies. For a small price, we can virtually travel to famous cities around the world, beautiful wildernesses, ancient ruins of Egypt and Persia, and the wonders of deserts and polar regions. This is why I like to watch scenic films, firstly. In this toiling world, only emotions can regulate the monotonous life. Watching appropriate romance films can fill the emotional sky, level the sea of hatred, and enhance the love between couples. This is why I like to watch romance films, secondly. In this world where people's hearts are becoming depraved, demons are capturing people, shadows are everywhere, and danger lurks everywhere, watching detective films can inspire thinking and broaden new knowledge. This is why I like to watch detective films, thirdly. In remote and exotic lands, steep cliffs and vast oceans, adventurers travel around, both increasing the courage to take risks and gaining a wide range of knowledge. This is why I like to watch adventure films, fourthly. However, domestic films that can meet the above four points are not easy to find often, which is why foreign films are popular.</p>

<p>We have introduced the new film Sign of the Cross, directed by Cecil B. DeMille, many times. The female lead he was looking for was ultimately Claudette Colbert. She can be considered a newcomer. We first saw her</p>
<p>in Herschel's fourth work, Playboy of Paris, playing a not-so-important female role. However, at that time, many people already recognized her talent, and today she was indeed selected by Cecil B. This figure is Claudette Colbert's expression in Roman attire.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e225">[Woman from Monte Carlo] <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Monte Carlo gives us a deep impression, not because geography tells us that it is a city in Monaco, but because MacDonald and Buchanan tell us on film that it is a gambling city with excellent scenery. Now Carlton's Woman From Monte Carlo is released. Because of the suggestion of the four words Monte Carlo, many people hope to see what it is all about?</p>
<p>The protagonist is the European old lover, Lilj Dagover. She was hired to Hollywood, and this is her first production. She can perform a plot that is usually narrated just right. She has taken on more than half of the work in almost every play, giving the audience extreme satisfaction. The male protagonists Walter Huston and Warren William perform the beauty of red flowers and green leaves.</p>
<p>The plot is very simple, just showing a scene of tragedy at sea. Because of the dispute in love, it caused great misfortune, and the war between the two ships was used as the focus of the outbreak of this tragedy. It clearly pointed out that women are a source of trouble, enough to affect everything. In the courtroom scene, love, filth, friendship, hate, emotion, reason, and responsibility were used to collide face-to-face, creating a very high peak. This is the achievement of the director's skill. At the end, the beautiful scenery of Monte Carlo and the prosperous singing and dancing were used to make the tense and tragic situation change sharply, forming a kind of leisurely elegance, like a wry smile, lingering in the minds of the audience. The superficial calm reflects the past, giving us deeper memories and emotions!</p>
<p>There are many magnificent sets, especially in the scene where the battleship sinks.</p>
<p>The organization, light, and photography are all good. The dialogue is even more commendable. Almost every word will run to our ears. This is not entirely because the sound is clear, but because most of its actors are British, so they speak honest and pure language, which invisibly increases the power of the performance.</p>
<p>In short, from the proof of this film, the products of First National Company have made great progress.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Overseas News: Peng Kai's Return to the Screen <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>

<p>Velma Bánky and Harry Liedtke have been separated from us for more than three years. Since marrying Rod LaRooque, although many newspapers and private letters have requested her to act, she has ultimately resolutely abandoned the screen and lived a fulfilling family life.</p>
<p>News came that this summer, she suddenly signed a contract with Universal Pictures and made a comeback to the camera. The film is titled Ihe Robel, directed and starring Luis Trenker from [The Battle of the Gate].</p>
<p>Please don't misunderstand. A female star's return to the screen after marriage is not necessarily due to divorce or other unfortunate events. Because if you use this general rule to speculate on Peng Kai's return to the screen, it would be a far cry from the truth. Her filming is entirely out of interest, and her husband also agrees with it.</p>
<p>When this film is about to be published, people will know.</p>
<p>It's not that Universal or she personally wants to keep any secrets, but because its interior and exterior scenes were not filmed in Hollywood. Therefore, very few people knew about this film in advance.</p>
<p>When Peng Kai left the screen, sound films were at their peak, so many people made many rumors, saying that her voice was not good, so she could not shoot sound films. Now? The·Rcbel is clearly a sound film, breaking another dumb puzzle.</p>
<p>Don't be happy, because she only signed a contract for one film. Maybe she will never be happy to shoot a second one. However, a flash in the pan is enough to comfort the fans who have been eager for her for one or two years!</p>

<p>Indeed, this barber college is not only closely related to Shi's later experience, but also extremely helpful. Gai Shi not only learned the methods of using combs and scissors, but also studied a lot of work in general decoration art; especially because he developed an aesthetic sentiment, he also had a unique understanding of [sitting and talking art]. For example, how should the main customer interact with him within a certain period of time, and then provide spiritual entertainment, transforming their strong character into gentle emotions. Like the above, these are the most important subjects for Shi in the school. In other words, this is the foundation of his success in the future.</p>
<p>Now, there are many people around him engaged in writing, proving that this artist of combs and scissors is an extraordinary director. Therefore, the male and female actors who appear in his films can often see the sitting and talking art that ordinary actors would not expect, forming his personal superior position in art. From this point of view, the subjects of that barber college did give Shi a great stiff power and undeniable.</p>
<p>When Shi was sixteen years old, he had a love affair with a girl in an apartment called Gretel. His debut feature-length comedy [Memories,] describes the circumstances of that era. Later, Shi finally suffered disappointment in love, so his views on films opposed the ideal of happy ending as the foundation. In other words, his outlook on life and love changed greatly because of this relationship.</p>
<p>Also, when Shi completed his barber's degree, he left the quaint university district and the washerwoman's mother, and decided to come to the capital Berlin. Naturally, it is very difficult for a person from the interior to find a job in a metropolis for the first time. Shi also could not avoid this example. He first carried coal, and then worked as a post office messenger, a barber at the prison, an inspector, and a road worker, etc., with as many as thirty-eight kinds of famous and infamous occupations. Finally, he wanted to engage in the most infamous [active actor], but who knew that this was an inhuman life, which can also be said to be the behavior of a blasphemer, so the result was still hopeless.</p>
<p>At that time, in 1905, there was no so-called photography studio in Berlin. If you wanted to take photos, you had to use natural light on the foundations of great buildings. If it rained, there was no way to do it. But soon, water lights were invented, allowing people to take photos freely indoors. The strength of the light is absolutely not affected by any side; in this way, there was the so-called film director system, and our comb and scissors artist, Mr. Steinhamm, began to appear under the mercury lamp from this time (1906). (End)</p>
<p>Mary Pickford Changed to Play a Middle-Aged Woman</p>
<p>Mary Pickford's most welcome and beloved feature is her beautiful curly hair, short skirt, and infinitely innocent childlike temperament, which has attracted countless viewers.</p>
<p>But now, Mary's youth is gradually fading away, which is the most heartbreaking thing for her. In her recent works, (Taming of the Shrew,) flirtatious women, we can no longer find these lovely situations in the two films. In short, she is not who she used to be now.</p>
<p>But! Why can the previous few films still be welcomed by the audience? This is nothing more than her faithful and sincere situation that can still get the audience's sympathy.</p>
<p>Now that she is a middle-aged woman, she has decided to change her lovely girl's dress and put on the simple and sincere dress of a middle-aged woman, and then try to return to the screen and continue to perform. But according to the general idea of the five people, her result may still be a failure.</p>
<p>[No,] absolutely not. She is now actively preparing and working hard to reunite with the audience who used to like her, so although she can no longer be called [the lover of the world,] at least she has to be called [the world's most faithful wife and mother.]</p>

<p>— Heart</p>
<p>In the past year, not only have many new actors emerged in Hollywood, but also many big stars from the silent film era who had already retired have returned to the screen.</p>
<p>Mlark, after suffering a serious illness, felt that life on the screen was not suitable for her health. So she made a big decision to no longer be filmed. However, after recovering from her illness, she returned to Hollywood... not only returned, but also started filming again. This time she is co-starring with ChestiMorris, and the film called B0enchofPronie will be completed soon.</p>

<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Think again! Imagine when you are determined to become a star, a good friend suddenly cures your eye disease, immediately giving you a new pair of eyes, allowing you to see the light again. How would you welcome it? How should you cherish your newly acquired eyes from now on?</p>
<p>Friends, I hope you always remember that your eyes were given to you by a good friend. You should cherish this priceless gift more than anything else you own. Be sure to remember not to do anything that could harm your eyesight. Such as reading in poorly lit places, eating curry, mustard, and scallions, chives, peppers, garlic, using public face towels to wipe your eyes, and the transmission of venereal diseases, etc., all must be prevented as much as possible, and not taken lightly.</p>
<p>Today, after carefully examining your eyes in the mirror, you should first thoroughly understand this priceless new gift, second, carefully cherish it, and third, know how to use it.</p>
<p>You've been using your eyes since today, that's right. But from now on, since you are determined to walk the path of a star, you should first train your eyes to have the eyesight of a star.</p>
<p>The eyesight of a star is different from that of ordinary people, it must have an appeal. The eyesight of a star is the sharpest expression of all kinds of expressions and actions of the whole body. The eyesight of a star can communicate the soul of the star with the soul of the director, and with the soul of the screenwriter, and also communicate the souls of the two of them with the audience, instantly using the screenwriter's bitterness to draw the tears of the actors, and using the director's humor to make the actors laugh uncontrollably.</p>
