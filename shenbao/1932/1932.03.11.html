<p>時評</p>
<h3>評二中全會（二彬）</h3>
<p>第六點希望於我國民者。曰勿虚憍。勿懦葸。勿輕於樂觀。勿易於悲觀實則我國民今日早已認淸當前之大難。覺悟自身應負之責任無人不願先國民黨而爲國奮鬥。二中全會所希望於國人者。吾人令請反之於國民黨。吾人認爲黨必身先實行。而後始有對我國民正式發言之餘地也。</p>
<p>其最末一點。則爲告世界友邦。希望友邦能維持。世界和平。主持公道，吾人亦認爲公理與和平。早已不能庇護弱者。此種呼聲。詎能博得若何之感應。抑且强權之主張者嘗有言。［破壞和平固爲强者。之罪惡。而弱者予强者以可乘之機。亦豈遂不應負相當之責任。］不求自助。而徒乞憐於人。半載以來。國人實已不勝其痛心矣。</p>
<p>舉凡宣言中所言者。吾人固渴望國民黨能一一實現。然而以昔例今。吾人之希望。詎有達到之可能。國難至此。國民黨至今日。尙不肯毅然明承此責。保持一負責政黨之嚴正態度。而猶含混其辭曰。［國難此。因果綦繁。］以［一致對外。］之口號。轉移國人之視綫。嗚呼。蚩蚩之氓。果眞可欺耶。</p>
<p>次之。吾人對於汪院長之閉會詞。亦不能已於言。汪氏之言曰。［我們現在</p>
<p>處境之困難。和明末彷彿。明末外有滿洲侵略遼東。内有李自成張獻忠流宼爲患。···］吾人認爲汪氏在認識上之錯誤。爲（一）但知目前之事實而矇蔽致張事實黨與政府所應負荷之責任。（二）今日日軍之侵略。其意義已不同於滿洲。而汪謂［不與爭什麽領導權］之共產黨。則更不同於張獻忠李自成等之流宼。（四）汪謂［明末在朝的人。犯了虚憍的毛病。］實則今日黨政府非僅虚憍。抑且貪汚。（五）滿洲入宼。明猶有戰死錦州之盧象昇。而今則崇朝之間。淪陷半壁河山。而無以正國家之典刑。</p>
<p>吾人認爲就今日之情形勢而言。較明代有過無不及獨是否人尙有足引以自慰。并告國民黨及世界友邦者。即我國民今日已有一致之覺醒决非明末時代之人民。尤决不甘作亡國之人民我人民要當以熱血爭取我民族之生存。决不以自前情勢之惡劣而悲觀前途之鉅艱。終當由我人民奮起負荷。吾人今日。决竭盡全力以共趨</p>
<p>總之我國民今日。祗願全國團結一致對外。祗願有良好政府。眞心與我國民合作。抗侮救國。故今後不論政府之當局如何。苟眞能順從民意。與人民切實合作。勿以精神團結等之空言。搪塞我人民者。必爲人民所擁護。反之而陽以服從民意爲言。而陰實拒絶人民之公意。則必爲人民所反對。此一定不易之原則也。</p>

<p>十九路軍駐</p>
<p>滬辦事處昨（十日）晨接到蔣總指揮光鼐及趙參謀處長一肩來電如下、㈠現據土人報告、敵壓迫當地人民拆毁瀏河汽車站、改築飛機塲、並積極部署人事、大有相機進攻之、勢所謂停戰運動、全屬欺人之談、請轉佈國人注意爲禱、蔣光鼐佳印、㈡（銜略）現據土人報告、連日浮橋地方、到有敵軍約六千餘名、於七日壓迫民衆、懸掛日旗、及威迫開市、又在新塘市之日軍、四處放火、將全市焚燬、其他慘事不一而足、趙一肩佳印、</p>
<h3>日軍迭襲太倉</h3>
<p>南京十日專　　電云、京方軍息、佳夜灰晨、日軍數次襲太倉、我軍純取守勢、未與大戰、白鶴港一帶、發現敵騎兵甚多、似將包抄靑暘港南路、進犯崑山、</p>
<h3>崑山太倉砲聲</h3>
<p>南京十日專電云、某機關據報、滬日軍總數達十三萬人、内陸戰隊萬人、義勇軍三千、餘均日第一二三五九十一十四等師正式陸、軍飛機約百五十餘架、軍艦在中國領海者六十五艘交通方面訊、崑山佳晨聞砲聲甚厲、夜間發現日飛機八架全城息、燈又太倉城被日砲火猛攻、東南城角被轟毁、城内有數處起火、居民黑夜奔逃</p>
<h3>我軍决死抵抗</h3>
<p>中央社九日</p>
<p>崑山電云、記者九日冒險赴前綫視察、見士兵均在戰壕内、態度異常沉着安閒、雖雨打風吹、毫無倦容、我軍將士之勇敢精神、殊可欽佩、據某高級軍官談、日來此間前綫異常沉寂、即小接觸亦無之、日軍旣不敢向我軍進犯、我亦奉命遵國聯勸告、堅守陣地、暫不前進、但據探報、敵方宣稱、將於十日向我軍進攻、以崑山爲目的地、敵雖大言不慚、我已有備無恐、敵如來犯、是自取滅亡、蓋此次與在滬之戰略逈然不同、此處係平原之區、小河　墳地小坵、到處皆是、爲天然戰塲、敵所恃唯一利器之大砲坦克車絕無用武之地、騎兵亦難施展、飛機如欲毁壞我陣地亦未必能毁、至於步兵我一萬人克敵二萬人、亦殊易易、現我上自總指揮軍長、下至士兵馬夫、莫不抱必死之心、不怕死不要錢、是我軍素具精神、如敵來犯、正中我懷、摧敵旣非難事、反攻收復尖地亦殊有把握、蓋我軍攻更利於守也、最後復向記者謂、請君轉告全國民衆、我十九路軍在滬抗敵、初以顧全租界安全、未向敵進攻、後以戰略關係、迫而退守此處、一誤豈堪再誤、我十九路决抱彈盡卒盡之旨、不再後退一步、但願全國民衆、一致興起、作我後盾、我雖犧牲至一兵一卒、只要民衆繼起、與此不共戴天之仇日、繼續死戰、此種犧牲、亦爲最光榮最有價値者也、</p>
<h3>日軍準備進攻</h3>
<p>十九軍京辦事處訊、日方以國際調查團即將抵滬、一面散發停戰空氣以圖掩飾其侵略野心、一面日夜將大軍調集前線、布置陣地積極準備進攻、並以飛機赴蘇常一帶偵察、連日前方不時有步哨衝突、我方軍隊决遵蔣總指揮令、日不來攻、决不出擊、日來攻即盡力抵抗、大戰隨時可以發生、、</p>
<h3>日軍佈置陣綫</h3>
<p>大美晚報云、前線連日無大戰事、雙方皆從事調兵鞏固陣地、日軍右翼在瀏河嘉定間者、現由加藤所統之第十一師團防守、該師團中之一旅團、現設司令部於嘉定、瀏河西南六哩處、現有日兵防營三所、每處以一中隊或多於此數之步兵守之、日飛機飛於瀏河區之天空者、據報未見有華兵、日軍現信華軍現集中於崑山境内、日第十四師團現防守南翔至黃渡線陣之中央與左翼、第九師團則駐於上海及四周之營内、聞日軍刻正迫令華人在南翔塡地、築造飛機塲、白川司令昨曾偕植田巡視瀏河至南翔之陣線、公共租界虹口與楊樹浦區内各地點、昨發見有日本軍事警察站崗服務、臂纒Ｍ·Ｐ·二字、以爲標識、閘北仍由日海軍陸戰隊防守</p>
<p>日方提議停戰</p>
<h3>郭泰祺昨午答覆</h3>

<h3>對於國聯大會意見</h3>
<p>顧維鈞博士、於三月八日、發表對於國聯大會之意見原爲英文、茲爲譯錄如下、代表列强在國聯大會發言者、間有對於遠東之糾紛情勢、雖屬極力設法、使其緩和、惟對於日本顯然違背國聯盟約一層、似乎反爲漠視、夫中日兩國、均爲國聯會員、而日本竟侵犯中國領土、已五月有奇、且尙繼續進攻、計日軍所侵占中國之區域、其面積倍於德國、雖經國聯行政院議决、令其退出仍抗不照辦、按遠東現在情勢、不獨對於中國一國在國聯立塲所應享會員之權利有所關係、即對於國聯本身之將來命運亦極有關係、夫倡言居間調停以爲解决糾紛之初步、雖屬甚善惟現在滿洲及上海之日本軍隊、有立即撤退之必要一層絕無調解之餘地、至國聯要求撤退日軍之議决案、無論國聯有無實力執行、而日本之侵犯與占據中國滿洲及其他部份、即爲違背國聯盟約、此種事實、殊不無輕予縱容也、尤有極關重要者、此次國聯大會、爲恢復國聯之權能及其威信起見、應將此種事實、顯爲聲明、並令日本將其當時承認國聯行政院上年九月三十日及十二月九日兩次議决案時所包含應允撤兵一層、切實履行、按國聯大會有權且有義務設法使行政院之權能、愈加有效、其法當將行政院之建議而業經當事國承認者堅持實行、故此種聲明、不特與公道原則、並無防碍、且可將行政院所採辦法、爲大會完全讚同及國聯全體公意之表示一層、使日本愈爲明確瞭解也、至將此次爭端之是非曲直澈底考核一層、當然可聽、現已首途來華之國聯調查團辦理、惟日本延期撤兵一節、殊無理由可予容忍、就事實上言、行政院各該議决案之條文已極爲明顯日本之應立即着手撤兵與調查團之工作、係判然兩事、今若離日本無理占據中國領土之本問題、而藉他項問題從事搪塞、其結果惟有使國聯威信愈加下落耳、尤有可駭異者、國聯竟向中國與日本同様提出忠告、要示將國聯根本原則、再予切實履行、查自此次爭端之始、中國即已訴之國聯、且曾聲明、不加保留、尊重國聯决議是則中國已以國聯會員資格、將國聯盟約及巴黎非戰公約之條欵、忠實遵守故現在如有實踐和平原則之必要、則須實踐者、唯有日本一國而已、蓋世界之新趨勢、正以和平原則爲基礎也、</p>

<h3>Comment on the Second Plenary Session (Er Bin)</h3>
<p>The sixth hope for our citizens is: do not be falsely arrogant, do not be cowardly, do not be lightly optimistic, do not be easily pessimistic. In fact, our citizens have long recognized the current great difficulties and are aware of their own responsibilities. Everyone is willing to fight for the country before the Kuomintang. As for what the Second Plenary Session hopes from the people, we ask that it be returned to the Kuomintang. We believe that the Party must take the lead in practice before it has room to formally speak to our citizens.</p>
<p>The last point is to tell the friendly nations of the world that we hope they can maintain world peace and uphold justice. We also believe that justice and peace can no longer protect the weak. How can such calls elicit any response? Moreover, those who advocate might have said: [Destroying peace is indeed the crime of the strong, but the weak giving the strong an opportunity to take advantage of them cannot escape a corresponding responsibility.] Seeking help from others instead of helping oneself has caused the people of the country unbearable pain for half a year.</p>
<p>We earnestly hope that the Kuomintang can realize everything stated in the declaration. However, judging from past examples, is it possible for our hopes to be realized? The national crisis has reached this point, and the Kuomintang is still unwilling to resolutely and clearly assume this responsibility, maintaining the solemn attitude of a responsible political party. Instead, they vaguely say: [The causes and consequences of the national crisis are complex,] and use the slogan of [uniting against foreign aggression] to divert the attention of the people. Alas, can the innocent people really be deceived?</p>
<p>Secondly, we cannot help but comment on President Wang's closing remarks. Wang said: [The difficulties we are currently facing are similar to those at the end of the Ming Dynasty. At the end of the Ming Dynasty, there was the invasion of Liaodong by the Manchus from outside, and the troubles of roving bandits like Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong from within...] We believe that Wang's errors in understanding are: (1) only knowing the current facts while obscuring the responsibilities that the Party and the government should bear. (2) The Japanese invasion today is different from the Manchus, and the Communists who Wang said [do not compete for leadership] are even more different from roving bandits like Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng. (4) Wang said [The people in the Ming Dynasty court made the mistake of being falsely arrogant.] In fact, today's Party government is not only falsely arrogant but also corrupt. (5) When the Manchus invaded, the Ming Dynasty still had Lu Xiangshan, who died in battle in Jinzhou. Today, half of the country has fallen in a short time, and there is no way to rectify the national code.</p>
<p>We believe that in terms of the current situation, it is worse than the Ming Dynasty. The only thing that people can take comfort in and tell the Kuomintang and the friendly nations of the world is that our people today have a unified awakening and are definitely not the people of the late Ming Dynasty. Moreover, we are determined not to be people who perish with their country. Our people must fight for the survival of our nation with hot blood, and we will never be pessimistic about the difficulties of the future due to the deterioration of the current situation. In the end, our people will rise up to bear the burden. Today, we are determined to do our utmost to strive together.</p>
<p>In short, our citizens today only wish that the whole country would unite to fight against foreign aggression, and only wish for a good government that sincerely cooperates with our citizens to resist humiliation and save the country. Therefore, no matter what the government authorities do in the future, if they can truly follow public opinion and earnestly cooperate with the people, and not use empty words such as spiritual unity to perfunctorily deal with our people, they will be supported by the people. On the contrary, if they outwardly claim to obey public opinion but secretly reject the people's will, they will be opposed by the people. This is a fixed and unchangeable principle.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Resolution Issues Declaration</h3>
<p>Based on the principle of not allowing the destruction of territorial integrity, the majority advocates immediately announcing the monitoring of the situation, and convening a round table conference after the conditions are fulfilled. (Geneva) The drafting committee appointed by the League of Nations Council has been busy all day and is said to have completed its work. The general resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute that it has drafted can be submitted to the Council tomorrow. Today, two small committees were also formed: one, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Simon, assisted by Greek representative Politis, Swedish representative Laymer, and Spanish representative Soru Tai, aimed at assisting the drafting committee in organizing the various proposals submitted by the members of the Council; one, chaired by the French representative, namely the President of the Administrative Council, Paul-Boncour, assisted by Czech representative Bienes, Finnish representative Aeli樞, and the third person from 臂洛, aimed at determining the candidates and scope of the committee that the Council will organize during the recess to implement the Council's work. After roughly organizing the various proposals, the drafting committee met at 4 p.m. today, with Finland also joining the discussion, and adjourned after two hours. The Simon subcommittee continued its work, met again at 7 p.m., and adjourned at 7:50 p.m. The nature of the discussion is currently kept secret, but it is said that the majority of the drafting committee members advocate immediately announcing the continuation of monitoring the situation and completely resolving the dispute. It is generally believed that the temporarily approved draft is based on the following: (1) a re-guarantee of the principles of the League of Nations Charter and the Kellogg-Briand Pact; (2) emphasizing Article 10 of the Charter regarding the prohibition of destroying territorial and political integrity; (3) maintaining the dignity of treaties and a statement of disapproval of boycotts; (4) the Council committee should be composed of members of the Administrative Council and six to eight representatives of small countries; (5) the Council committee should strive to mediate in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article 15 of the Charter, in order to realize the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Japanese troops; (6) convene a round table conference after the above conditions are fulfilled; (7) the Council committee must handle all kinds of issues in the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Simon subcommittee has completed its work today. It is said that its presentations are closely related to the first three points of the above draft resolution, but it does not mention boycotts. It is said that after Simon's subcommittee presented the historical background of the Sino-Japanese dispute, it advocated reiterating the previous resolutions of the League of Nations Administrative Council and declaring that the League of Nations Council would find it difficult to recognize any situation, treaty, or agreement that contradicts the League of Nations Charter, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the resolutions of the Administrative Council. The Paul-Boncour subcommittee was unable to complete its work tonight. (Reuters dispatch from Geneva, 9th) (Geneva) The drafting committee of the League of Nations General Assembly has largely completed drafting a draft resolution today. If it can be passed on Saturday, it will be submitted to the plenary session of the League of Nations General Assembly in order. The two subcommittees led by British representative Simon and Finnish representative Aeli樞 have each read and reviewed a part of the proposed resolution today. It is said that the content includes (1) maintaining the authority of the League of Nations Charter; (2) moderately establishing the principle that the withdrawal of Japanese troops is the starting condition for negotiations; (3) establishing the binding force of the League of Nations Charter and its inviolability under Article 10; (4) reiterating the illegality of acquiring territory or political interests by force; (5) in addition, it reiterates the recommendations of the Council and the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on March 4, and roughly indicates the number of people, selection, and powers of the committee to arrange and handle negotiations in Shanghai. Today, some drafting committee members advocated that the number of committee members may be smaller and should be given the power to act in the most resolute manner and to represent the joint actions of major powers, which can exert strong pressure on Japan. However, the issue of this committee will probably be resolved in the subcommittee meeting on Saturday. After the subcommittee makes a decision, the entire case will be submitted to the entire drafting committee for approval, then to the General Committee for approval, and finally to the General Assembly. (Dispatch from the National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The drafting committee of the League of Nations General Assembly's general resolution discussed secretly until late at night today. It is said that the discussion was focused on finding a way to resolve the most difficult issue of the resolution containing a severe reprimand of Japan's actions in Shanghai, which several small countries strongly advocated. The consultation will continue tomorrow morning, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution can be reached at that time. (Dispatch from the National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations General Assembly's general resolution will solemnly declare the League of Nations' determination to maintain China's territorial integrity. The drafting committee for drafting the resolution reconvened this morning. It is said that after consultations until noon, they have actually agreed on the wording of the resolution. As for its content, according to well-informed sources, it will contain a preamble and four main points. The preamble will state that all the responsibilities of the League of Nations in the event of disputes between member states are fully applicable to this Sino-Japanese dispute. Then, it will list the articles in the Charter that guarantee the territorial integrity and political independence of member states, as well as other treaties related to this, and declare that member states are each responsible for resolving all international disputes only through peaceful means. The main points of the resolution are: First, reaffirm the Briand Declaration of December 10 and the Council's recommendation to Japan on February 16, stating that the League of Nations cannot recognize or tolerate the violation of China's territorial integrity and political sovereignty; Second, solemnly declare the illegality of resolving the current dispute under force and other coercion; Third, invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact, declaring that international disputes can only be resolved by peaceful means; Fourth, declare that the League of Nations still retains the right to decide in the future whether all detailed resolutions of this dispute comply with the principles and regulations of the League of Nations. (Dispatch from the National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Presidium of the General Assembly is striving to draft a resolution to conclude the debate on the Sino-Japanese conflict. It has not succeeded tonight, but progress is very smooth. An agreement has been reached on the declaration of principles, which will be used as the basis for the resolution in the future. The wording of the declaration is roughly finalized and is expected to be passed. Its content first traces the obligations of the signatory countries of the League of Nations Covenant and the Paris Peace Pact, and solemnly declares that the nature of Article 10 of the Covenant, which stipulates the territorial integrity of each country, is very important. Second, based on the meaning of U.S. Secretary of State Stimson's letter to Senator Borah, it declares that the member states of the League of Nations cannot recognize any territorial expansion and all territorial or political changes obtained in China by military force since the conflict. As for the section on implementation methods in the resolution, opinions have not yet been unified, which is the most difficult part. In general, the General Assembly will, based on the resolution passed on March 4, request the Chinese and Japanese governments to promptly change the cessation of hostilities into a truce, and request the countries with special relations in the Shanghai Concession to report to the special committee of the Recognizing General Assembly on how the previous League of Nations Council requested implementation, and will stipulate the organization and powers of this special committee. It is expected that some countries with no direct relationship will also join. The committee's resolution finally advises that a Shanghai Peace Conference be convened as soon as the truce conditions are established. The Presidium will meet again tomorrow afternoon to seek final agreement. (Dispatch from Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Assembly will organize a committee composed of eighteen members and one chairman. This committee should strive for reconciliation between the two sides in accordance with Section 3 of Article 15 of the Covenant. If it is ineffective, it should be handled again in accordance with Section 4 of the same article. The committee must quickly prepare a report on the cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of Japanese troops. As for the establishment of a neutral zone, four member states of the League of Nations with special interests in Shanghai may participate in maintaining order. If the committee deems it necessary, it may seek the opinion of the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In any case, the report must be submitted before May 1. The General Assembly may be reconvened with the consent of the chairman. (Dispatch from Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Paul-Boncour subcommittee held a meeting yesterday until nearly midnight, which proves that some difficult proposals are not easy to resolve. This morning, they continued to meet until noon. It is hoped that a plan will be formulated and submitted to the Council's drafting committee this afternoon. Then, the drafting committee will begin to combine Simon's declaration with Paul-Boncour's document. The progress of the drafting committee also has various obstacles, especially because Chairman Hymans hopes that the wording of the resolution can win the unanimous agreement of both China and Japan. The delegations of various countries are exchanging opinions privately and constantly testing the feelings of the Chinese and Japanese representatives, so they feel very busy. Whether the League of Nations Council meeting can end this week is now very doubtful. The funeral of Briand is scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, and of course there can be no office on that day. While the hope of obtaining unanimous agreement exists, Chairman Hymans is still waiting for the results of the consultations between the Chinese and Japanese representatives. The Chinese delegation also sent a document to the meeting, reiterating that the hostilities are still continuing. On March 8, Japanese aircraft fired machine guns at Chinese civilians in Hangzhou from the sky. On March 7, the Japanese army advanced again. The Japanese delegation also sent a telegram from Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshizawa, stating that he had instructed the Japanese ambassador in Shanghai to promptly conduct negotiations in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations Council resolution of March 4. The report of the great powers on March 9 has also been transmitted here, stating that the Japanese commander issued a statement on March 8, delineating the boundaries of the Japanese army's military operations and warning the Chinese army not to advance to the lines connecting the various locations opened up to avoid conflict. The report denies the rumors that the right wing of the Japanese army had contact on March 7 and said that Japanese aircraft are conducting daily reconnaissance of the Chinese army's lines and rear. There is no sign that the Japanese army is advancing. It is said that the Chinese army has received reinforcements, and it is reported that some reinforcements have arrived in Taicang. Now, thanks to the diligent work of the Paul-Boncour subcommittee and the drafting committee, a resolution has been drafted at 1 p.m. today, and its provisions can guarantee unanimous agreement. It has now been telegraphed to the governments of China and Japan for their review. The General Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow, and it is hoped that replies from China and Japan can be received in time so that the final meeting can be held. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The resolution drafted by the drafting committee proposes that a committee be organized with Chairman Hymans and the twelve members of the Administrative Council to consider the Sino-Japanese issue and report to the League of Nations Council meeting on May 1. It is expected that Japan can accept this resolution, and it will then be passed by the Council. The full text of the resolution is very long and will be published later. The resolution stipulates that the two parties shall fulfill the treaties they have signed with each other, abide by the provisions of the League of Nations Charter, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations resolution, and resolve the disputes between the two sides peacefully. The resolution also reiterates the resolutions of the Administrative Council on September 30 and December 10, and the resolution of the Council on March 4. The resolution earnestly declares that disputes between member states cannot violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact or be resolved under military pressure, and stipulates the organization of a committee of nineteen people. In addition to Chairman Hymans and the twelve directors, the remaining six people will be decided by the Council through public election of the representatives of six countries. The first step of the committee should be to use the power of mediation in accordance with Section 3 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Charter. If mediation is ineffective, it should submit its recommendations to the Council in accordance with Section 4 of the same article. The committee shall prepare a report and submit it to the Council meeting on May 1. The resolution also requests the powers with special relations in Shanghai to assist in handling the police affairs of the Shanghai neutral zone and stipulates that the committee may, if necessary, submit the difficult points for judgment to the International Court of Justice.

<p>Shanghai Office received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai and Chief of Staff Zhao Yijian this morning (the 10th) as follows: (1) According to local reports, the enemy is forcing local people to dismantle the Liuhe bus station and rebuild an airfield, and is actively deploying personnel, with a great momentum for attacking at any time. The so-called ceasefire movement is completely deceptive. Please inform the people of the country and pray. Jiang Guangnai, seal. (2) (Title omitted) According to local reports, about 6,000 enemy troops have arrived in the Fuliuqiao area in recent days. On the 7th, they forced the people to hang Japanese flags and forced them to open the market. The Japanese army in Xintang City set fire everywhere and burned the entire city. Other tragedies are too numerous to mention. Zhao Yijian, seal.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Repeatedly Attacks Taicang</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th Special</p>
<p>Dispatch: According to military news from Beijing, last night until early morning, the Japanese army attacked Taicang several times. Our army took a purely defensive stance and did not engage in a major battle. Many enemy cavalry were found in the Baihegang area, and it seemed that they were going to encircle the Qingyanggang South Road and invade Kunshan.</p>
<h3>Gunfire in Kunshan and Taicang</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th Special Dispatch: According to a report from a certain agency, the total number of Japanese troops in Shanghai has reached 130,000, including 10,000 marines, 3,000 volunteers, and the rest are formal land forces from the Japanese 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, and 14th Divisions. There are about 150 aircraft, and 65 warships are in Chinese territorial waters. According to transportation news, Kunshan heard very loud gunfire last morning. At night, eight Japanese aircraft were found. The whole city was dark, and the lights were out. Taicang City was attacked by fierce Japanese artillery fire. The southeast corner of the city was destroyed, and several fires broke out in the city. Residents fled in the dark.</p>
<h3>Our Army Resolves to Resist to the Death</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, 9th</p>
<p>Kunshan Dispatch: The reporter risked his life to go to the front line for inspection on the 9th and saw that the soldiers were all in the trenches, with an unusually calm and relaxed attitude. Although the rain was beating down, they showed no signs of fatigue. The brave spirit of our soldiers is truly admirable. According to a certain senior military officer, the front line here has been unusually quiet in recent days, and there have been no even small contacts. The Japanese army dared not attack our army, and we were also ordered to comply with the League of Nations' advice, to firmly defend our positions, and not to advance for the time being. However, according to reconnaissance reports, the enemy claimed that they would attack our army on the 10th, with Kunshan as the destination. Although the enemy boasted shamelessly, we were prepared and not afraid. If the enemy comes to attack, it is courting its own destruction. This time, the strategy is completely different from the battle in Shanghai. This place is a plain area, with small rivers, graveyards, and small mounds everywhere, which are natural battlefields. The enemy's only powerful weapons, cannons and tanks, have no use at all. Cavalry is also difficult to deploy, and even if aircraft want to destroy our positions, they may not be able to. As for infantry, it is very easy for our 10,000 people to defeat 20,000 enemy troops. Now, from the commander-in-chief and army commander down to the soldiers and grooms, all are determined to die, not afraid of death and not wanting money, which is the inherent spirit of our army. If the enemy comes to attack, it will be right in our arms. It is not difficult to defeat the enemy, and it is also very certain to counterattack and recover the forward positions. Our army is more advantageous in attacking than defending. Finally, he told the reporter, "Please tell the people of the country that our 19th Route Army resisted the enemy in Shanghai, initially to take care of the safety of the concession and did not attack the enemy. Later, due to strategic considerations, we were forced to retreat here. How could we make the same mistake again? Our 19th Route Army is determined to exhaust its ammunition and troops and will not retreat another step. We only hope that the people of the country will rise up together and be our backing. Even if we sacrifice every soldier and every pawn, as long as the people continue to rise up and continue to fight to the death with this irreconcilable enemy, Japan, this kind of sacrifice will also be the most glorious and most valuable."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Prepares to Attack</h3>
<p>According to the 19th Army's Beijing Office, the Japanese side is about to dispatch an international investigation team to Shanghai. On the one hand, they are spreading an atmosphere of ceasefire in an attempt to cover up their aggressive ambitions. On the other hand, they are gathering large forces on the front line day and night, arranging positions and actively preparing to attack, and sending aircraft to reconnoiter the Su-Chang area. In recent days, there have been frequent skirmishes between sentries on the front line. Our troops are determined to obey Commander-in-Chief Jiang's order: if the Japanese do not attack, we will not attack; if the Japanese attack, we will do our best to resist. A major battle can break out at any time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Deploys Lines</h3>
<p>The Great American Evening Post reports that there have been no major battles on the front line in recent days. Both sides are engaged in transferring troops and consolidating their positions. The right wing of the Japanese army between Liuhe and Jiading is currently defended by the 11th Division under the command of Kato. One brigade of this division has now set up its headquarters in Jiading, six miles southwest of Liuhe. There are currently three Japanese troop defense camps, each guarded by a company or more of infantry. Japanese aircraft flying in the skies over the Liuhe area have reportedly not seen any Chinese troops. The Japanese army now believes that the Chinese army is currently concentrated in Kunshan. The Japanese 14th Division is currently defending the central and left wings of the line from Nanxiang to Huangdu, and the 9th Division is stationed in the camps in and around Shanghai. It is said that the Japanese army is currently forcing Chinese people in Nanxiang to fill in the ground and build an airfield. Commander Shirakawa inspected the line from Liuhe to Nanxiang yesterday with Ueda. Military police stations have been found stationed in various locations in the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts of the Public Concession, with the letters "M.P." on their arms for identification. Zhabei is still defended by the Japanese Marine Corps.</p>
<p>The Japanese side proposes a ceasefire</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi's Reply Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Japanese army, relying on force, suddenly attacked Shanghai, and it has been more than a month. Recently, our army retreated to the second line of defense, still trying to continue the attack. Now, at the time of the League of Nations General Assembly, they suddenly claimed to propose a ceasefire based on the League of Nations resolution. Their new note was entrusted to British Minister Lampson the night before and handed over to our authorities. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi handed over the reply to British Minister Lampson yesterday afternoon to be forwarded to the Japanese side and the League of Nations Council. Although the ceasefire issue is now being contacted through official documents between the two sides, whether it can be realized depends on whether the Japanese side is sincere.</p>
<h3>Document from the Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>The document from the Japanese side was handed over to Vice Minister Guo by Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu to British Minister Lampson at 5:30 p.m. on the 9th. The original text is as follows: "The Japanese military and political authorities stationed in Shanghai are now prepared to begin negotiations with the Chinese authorities in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Council resolution of March 4. The current situation on the front line is worrying. It is urgently necessary to establish a concrete agreement immediately in order to achieve a complete ceasefire and then discuss and determine the method of withdrawing Japanese troops. The Japanese authorities believe that the Japanese side's attitude towards this matter has been known to the Chinese authorities. However, since the League of Nations Council passed the above-mentioned resolution, there has been no indication from the Chinese authorities regarding the resolution passed by the League of Nations Council. The Japanese authorities now wish to solemnly declare their readiness to conduct negotiations in accordance with the resolution."</p>
<h3>Vice Minister Guo's Reply</h3>
<p>Vice Minister Guo asked British Minister Lampson to forward the reply to Japanese Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu yesterday afternoon as follows: "The Chinese government has accepted the League of Nations Council resolution of March 4 and is now prepared to conduct negotiations with the Japanese authorities in accordance with the provisions of the resolution and the following understandings declared by Dr. Yen Hui-ching, the chief representative of China: (1) These negotiations are limited to matters relating to the implementation of a ceasefire and the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops; (2) The withdrawal must not be attached to any conditions. The Chinese government has declared through its chief representative in Geneva its readiness to conduct negotiations for the above reasons and based on the above understandings, and believes that the Japanese authorities are fully aware of this fact. The document from the Japanese authorities, which was forwarded by Sir Miles Lampson, British Minister, at 5:30 p.m. on March 9, indicated that the Japanese authorities are also equally prepared to conduct the above-mentioned negotiations. Therefore, the Chinese government believes that there is a way to start these negotiations."</p>
<h3>League of Nations Resolution</h3>
<p>The text of the League of Nations Council resolution of March 4, on which the Chinese and Japanese sides are based, has been seen in this newspaper on March 6. For the convenience of readers, we are reprinting the original text as follows: "(1) Requests the Chinese and Japanese governments to take the necessary steps immediately to ensure the effective implementation of the orders issued by their respective military authorities to cease hostile acts; (2) As for how the first article is requested, the League of Nations Council should be notified of the facts at any time; (3) The League of Nations Council recommends that Chinese and Japanese representatives should hold negotiations with the assistance of the naval and military authorities of the above-mentioned countries, in order to seek a definite cessation of hostile acts and arrange for the withdrawal of Japanese troops. The League of Nations Council hopes that the neutral countries will report to the Council at any time on the progress of the negotiations."</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi's Declaration</h3>
<p>China Prepares for Peace Talks</p>
<p>Japan Falsely Accuses China of Obstruction</p>
<p>Regarding the Reuters report from Tokyo yesterday morning (the 10th), in which the Japanese side accused the Chinese authorities of obstructing armistice and the withdrawal of Japanese troops, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi issued a special declaration yesterday, stating that the Chinese side has clearly expressed in both Shanghai and Geneva its readiness for negotiations. China not only accepted the Ganteau flagship proposal of February 28th and the resolution of the League of Nations Council Chairman Peng Gu of February 29th, but also the resolution of the League of Nations Assembly of March 4th. How could the Japanese authorities and their representative in Geneva, Sato, not know this? Before yesterday, the last notification we received from the Japanese side was the so-called "Basic Conditions for Immediate Ceasefire," which was delivered by Admiral Kle on March 2nd. We immediately declared that we could not accept it because it differed greatly from the Ganteau proposal, which the British representative used as a basis for reporting to the League of Nations Council on February 29th, and Peng Gu's resolution. Moreover, although Japan accepted the League of Nations Assembly's resolution of March 4th, China still dares not believe that the Japanese side is sincere in preparing for armistice negotiations, because Japan has repeatedly accepted the League of Nations Council's resolutions of September and December, but has never fulfilled them. China's attitude has always been consistent. Now, in view of yesterday's notification from the Japanese side, it is hoped that a satisfactory negotiation can be achieved as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Explaining the Chinese Situation</h3>
<p>A Speech at a Banquet for Foreign Journalists</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Guo Taiqi hosted a banquet for foreign journalists at the United China Association at 12:30 yesterday morning. His speech was as follows:</p>
<p>It is a great honor to have you all here today. I regret that Minister Luo could not host you in person. Before the Shanghai Incident occurred, the Minister of Foreign Affairs often had the opportunity to meet with journalists from various countries to strengthen communication. You are aware of the reasons why Minister Luo could not attend today. If you have the opportunity to visit Beijing, Minister Luo will extend a sincere welcome. This gathering can be considered one of the grandest events in Shanghai's journalistic circles in recent years. Many of you have traveled far to personally witness the tragic events of the past few weeks. I believe you will report what you have seen and heard truthfully and without reservation to the world. With the advancement of modern science and convenient transportation, you are able to spread the facts you have risked your lives to obtain to the four corners of the world, enabling the world to form a fair opinion on major issues that endanger world peace. This is all thanks to your collaborative efforts. In the past thirty or forty days, you have witnessed a powerful country using the most advanced weapons to invade its neighbor. The result of this, I need not elaborate. If someone were to visit Zhabei and observe the ruins and trenches, they would understand the courage of the Chinese people, who are not afraid of sacrifice and are willing to die to defend their country. This is truly the spirit depicted in the famous poem by the English writer Macaulay. Our troops have withdrawn beyond twenty kilometers (kilometers) for military necessity, far beyond what those responsible for safeguarding the safety of the Public Concession have demanded. But what is the situation today? Is there a distance of twenty kilometers between the advancing Japanese troops and the retreating Chinese troops? If the two armies were indeed twenty kilometers apart, even a fool would know that there would be no further conflict. Even last night, our military authorities reported that our troops had to continue resisting because the Japanese continued to advance. In the past four weeks, all peace proposals mediated by friendly countries have been fully accepted by our side. The last time was the British flagship's proposal and the League of Nations resolution of March 4th. China has no intention of attacking and has already ordered its defense forces to cease hostilities. If both sides adhere to the twenty-kilometer separation line at this time, then a ceasefire would have been achieved long ago. This can be asserted. The security and integrity of the Shanghai Public Concession have never been harmed by our country. Before January 28th, the lives and property of the residents in the Shanghai urban area, the Public Concession police, and our Chinese police were all able to fulfill their responsibility of protection. Even if there were occasional special incidents, they would not have completely lost their authority as they have this time. I cannot speak on behalf of the Public Concession authorities, but it is not unreasonable to say that if the situation before January 28th were restored, the ordinary lives of the citizens could return to normal. Now that commerce has come to a standstill and the situation has made no progress, whose responsibility is it? Chinese troops have not been stationed near the concession for more than a week. After retreating twenty kilometers, the Chinese and Japanese troops still cannot be separated to prevent contact. You, with your discerning judgment, should be able to see where the responsibility lies. China believes that the issues of the Northeast and Shanghai are interconnected. We have always sought to resolve them through the investigation and judgment of the League of Nations. Our method of resolving international disputes today is like an individual who has moved beyond the barbaric era of cave dwelling and seeks justice in a court of law. Therefore, the wise men who established the League of Nations hoped that international disputes could be investigated and resolved using judicial methods. China adheres to this method and will not accept other methods or seek other paths until the League of Nations arbitration fails. At this time, China is preparing and eagerly hoping that the League of Nations resolution will be implemented as soon as possible. This is what the Chinese representative in Geneva has clearly stated to the world.</p>

<h3>Telegraph to Insist on Resistance</h3>
<p>Xiong Xiling et al. telegraphed from Beiping yesterday, "Please forward to the Shanghai All-Organizations National Salvation United Association. Public sentiment in the North is strong, and the authorities are gradually becoming active. The Volunteer Army is making progress. We hope you will insist on resistance and urge a counter-offensive. The whole country will surely unite. Xiong Xiling, Wang Zaoshi, Zuo Shunsheng, et al.</p>
<p>Gu Weijun</p>
<h3>Opinions on the League of Nations Assembly</h3>
<p>Dr. Gu Weijun expressed his opinions on the League of Nations Assembly on March 8th. The original was in English, and the translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Those who spoke on behalf of the powers at the League of Nations Assembly have tried their best to alleviate the situation of the dispute in the Far East. However, they seem to have ignored the fact that Japan has clearly violated the League of Nations Covenant. Both China and Japan are members of the League of Nations, but Japan has invaded Chinese territory for more than five months and is still continuing its offensive. The area of China occupied by the Japanese army is twice the size of Germany. Although the League of Nations Council has resolved to order its withdrawal, it has refused to comply. The current situation in the Far East is not only related to the rights of China as a member of the League of Nations, but also to the future fate of the League of Nations itself. It is good to advocate mediation as a preliminary step in resolving disputes, but there is absolutely no room for negotiation on the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops from Manchuria and Shanghai. Regardless of whether the League of Nations has the power to enforce the resolution requiring the withdrawal of Japanese troops, Japan's invasion and occupation of Manchuria and other parts of China is a violation of the League of Nations Covenant. This fact should not be condoned lightly. What is particularly important is that the League of Nations Assembly should clearly declare this fact in order to restore the League's power and prestige, and order Japan to earnestly fulfill its commitment to withdraw its troops, which was included when it recognized the two resolutions of the League of Nations Council on September 30th and December 9th of last year. The League of Nations Assembly has the right and the obligation to find ways to make the power of the Council more effective. The way to do this is to insist on the implementation of the Council's recommendations that have been recognized by the parties concerned. Therefore, this declaration not only does not hinder the principle of justice, but also makes it clear to Japan that the measures taken by the Council are fully endorsed by the Assembly and represent the common will of the League of Nations. As for the thorough investigation of the merits of this dispute, it is of course up to the League of Nations investigation team, which has already set off for China, to handle it. However, there is no reason to tolerate Japan's delay in withdrawing its troops. In fact, the wording of the Council's resolutions is very clear: Japan should immediately begin withdrawing its troops, and the work of the investigation team are two separate matters. If we deviate from the fundamental issue of Japan's unreasonable occupation of Chinese territory and use other issues as a pretext, the only result will be to further undermine the League of Nations' credibility. What is even more appalling is that the League of Nations has issued the same advice to China and Japan, urging them to earnestly implement the fundamental principles of the League. Since the beginning of this dispute, China has appealed to the League of Nations and declared that it would respect the League's resolutions without reservation. China has faithfully abided by the terms of the League of Nations Covenant and the Pact of Paris as a member of the League of Nations. Therefore, if it is necessary to practice the principles of peace now, it is only Japan that needs to practice them. The new trend in the world is based on the principles of peace.</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed to the National Government</p>
<p>Please Send High-Ranking Officials to Supervise the Army in Resisting Japan</p>
<p>Telegraph Chiang Kai-shek to personally defend the national crisis</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the National Government and the Military Affairs Commission yesterday, "To the National Government of Luoyang and the Military Affairs Commission: After the withdrawal of the garrison troops from Songhu, the central government, as a measure to punish the past and prevent future troubles, has continued to send reinforcements to restore the area when the opportunity arises. However, after the arrival of the various armies, their ranks are equal, and their control and dispatch should be the responsibility of a dedicated person. Moreover, the war zone is gradually expanding, and careful planning is especially important. However, we have not yet heard that the central government has issued an order for unified command. In the event of encountering the enemy, if the orders are not centralized, it will inevitably lead to delays and failures. The Tang Dynasty's Nine Military Governors' armies collapsed in Xiangzhou, and the Huai Xi campaign ultimately succeeded due to Pei Du's personal supervision of the army. This shows that command is paramount and unification is key. There are historical precedents for this. The Japanese Kou invaded Shanghai and have changed commanders three times. It is a clear indication of the importance of military command that General Shirakawa was in charge. The reason why the central government has been hesitant and cautious in sending dedicated personnel is nothing more than considering the peace of East Asia and not wanting to create a situation where it's throwing a mouse to avoid breaking the vase. However, the Japanese have already gained an inch and want a mile. After Shirakawa, they were succeeded by Anbo, who is determined to encompass the Southeast and contain the Northeast, crushing our central main force under a hammer. If we continue to hesitate and watch, then even if there are many reinforcements, it will only be feeding the enemy bait. Now that the enemy is deep and the situation is urgent, the people of the country are fighting to defend their territory. Even if they suffer any sacrifices, they should be willing to endure them. In the event that the government authorities still hesitate and look back, it will inevitably lead to the defeat of the army and the loss of land, causing the people to despair of the country and believe that the country has abandoned them as if it were discarding something. The ancient saying that they would 'flee north to the Xiongnu and south to the Yue' will surely come true. Not only will you permanently lose your political lives, but the nation will also be plunged into eternal destruction. Please, the central government should quickly appoint high-ranking officials to supervise the army in resisting the enemy and restoring the lost territory in order to boost morale. This telegram is urgent and awaits your orders. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows and asks. In addition, a telegram was sent to Chiang Kai-shek, 'To Committee Member Chiang Kai-shek of Nanjing: The Japanese Kou are pressing on Su... The central government must have continued to send reinforcements. However, the ranks of the various armies are equal, and their control is especially important and unified. Unless a special official is dispatched by the central government to supervise, it is feared that it will cause delay and failure. Your Excellency holds the position of chief of the Military Affairs Commission and has personally participated in the great cause of national construction. It is your righteous duty to defend the country in its great crisis, and you should not avoid suspicion. If you personally supervise the army for fear that it will be used as an excuse by the Japanese Kou to accuse us of lightly starting a war, then the Japanese Kou have already invaded and occupied the Northeast and advanced into Songhu. After Shirakawa supervised the army, he was succeeded by An. Security has already gained an inch and wants a mile, without any scruples. If we cherish the lives of the people and avoid greater sacrifices, then after our army withdrew 20 kilometers, the Japanese Kou still continued to press on. It is impossible to seek completeness through compromise, and sacrifices are difficult to avoid. We are fighting to maintain the life of the nation. Even if we sacrifice to any extent, the people will have no complaints. If we sacrifice to avoid war deliberately, the sacrifices will be even greater, and the people will certainly point their fingers at the government. How will Your Excellency, who has been entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the party and the country, explain yourself? This central point is extremely important. Your Excellency once encouraged himself with the examples of Lu Xiufu and Wen Tianxiang, and the association wants to encourage itself with the example of Kou Zhun of Chanyuan. Not yielding to benevolence is great courage. I only hope that you will make a decisive decision and resolutely ask to go. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows and asks.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Note</p>
<h3>The Japanese Side Has Not Yet Responded</h3>
<p>It Is Said That a Telegram Has Been Sent to Tokyo for Inquiry</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the Municipal Government sent a letter to Japanese Consul General Murai and the consuls of various countries the day before yesterday, stating that it would continue to maintain public security, hygiene, public utilities, and other services in Wusong, Zhabei, Jiangwan, and other areas. As of last night (the 9th), Japanese Consul General Murai had not yet responded. However, according to the Japanese side, the Japanese may not be able to agree to this. Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Municipal Council again informally discussed the sanitation issue in the Kunlun area of the Public Concession. Because it was not known what approach the Japanese consul and military commander would take, no concrete decisions could be made. The Municipal Government's statement was also mentioned briefly at the time. It is said that before the Municipal Government's statement, the Japanese had promised the Municipal Council to clean up the garbage near the concession. However, the issue of police power and cleaning up the remnants of the battlefield in Zhabei and other areas is far more important than simply protecting residents and hygiene. When the Japanese express their recognition or rejection of the exercise of police power by the Chinese within their occupied territory, they will inevitably express their views on the handling of the war zone. If the Municipal Government's statement can be recognized, it can be considered a step forward in terms of local reconstruction and restoration of normalcy. Conversely, if the Chinese are refused the right to exercise civil administration in the area occupied by the Japanese army, it will further disrupt commerce and local government affairs. Last night, it was heard that the Japanese consulate had telegraphed Tokyo and the local Japanese military commander regarding the issue of police power. It is said that the Chinese police must carry military weapons when performing their duties. This is what the Japanese side considers a problem. According to the Japanese side, the actions of the Japanese in Zhabei and other places cannot be interpreted as occupying the area. The Japanese army is only temporarily stationed there, but the date of withdrawal will depend on the actions of the Chinese soldiers and cannot be predetermined.</p>
<h3>Wang Geng Escorted to Beijing for Investigation</h3>
<p>Summoned by the Director of the Public Security Bureau Yesterday</p>
<p>Escorted to Nanjing in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Wang Geng, the independent brigade commander of the 88th Division, was previously arrested by the Japanese military headquarters. After the municipal government protested to the leader and consul, the Japanese army released Wang. However, public opinion was rampant, saying that Wang was suspected of leaking military secrets. The central government, considering the case serious, telegraphed the municipal government to quickly escort Wang Geng to Beijing for investigation. Yesterday, Wang was summoned by Wen Yingxing, the director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and escorted to Beijing for investigation in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>U.S. Troops Stationed in Shanghai Will Return to Fiji</h3>
<p>Reuters reported from Washington on the 9th that it was heard today that the U.S. government is now planning to withdraw the 31st U.S. Infantry Regiment from Shanghai and return it to Manila.</p>
<h3>British Troops Will Be Replaced and Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Scots Fusiliers, a British regiment, is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the transport ship Lancashire on the 18th of this month if the situation in the city can be withdrawn.

The replacement unit, the 1st Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment, will arrive in Shanghai from Mumbai on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Overseas Compatriots Console the 19th Route Army</h3>
<p>Special Donations Are Currently Being Collected</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese National Salvation Economic Committee and the Overseas Chinese Federation received two condolence messages and 30,000 yuan in consolation money from overseas compatriots in a certain port. They also said that special donations are currently being collected and can raise more than 100,000 yuan. In addition, monthly donations are being conducted, amounting to approximately 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per month. The anti-Japanese resistance will not stop, and monthly donations will never cease. The extracted condolence messages are as follows: (1) A message from overseas compatriots: "Your army is loyal and defends the country. Overseas Chinese are grateful for thwarting the arrogance of the stubborn Japanese. You are the backbone of the motherland, and the great powers have shifted their attention, raising our international status. The overseas Chinese in the remote regions are all in admiration. We respectfully send 30,000 yuan via telegraph through the Hefeng Bank. Please have Mr. Lin Youren, together with Xu Jigong and Liu Shibeng, act as representatives to sincerely console the troops. We believe that Representative Lin and others will convey our humble sentiments and be kindly accepted. The small amount is like a spoonful of water and cannot make up for even a fraction of the need, but it is also to express the red heart of love and support of the overseas Chinese. We earnestly hope that you will continue your efforts and resist to the death. Soldiers use their lives as the vanguard, and overseas Chinese use their economy as the rearguard. Each will do their best, each will do what they can, and together we will expel the invaders and avoid becoming a sequel to the fall of Korea. The Jiangtian is in sight, and our ardent blood is surging. Words cannot express our feelings. We respectfully wish you victory." (2) A message from the representatives: "Since Zhang Xueliang invented the non-resistance policy that led to the destruction of the country, losing hundreds of thousands of square miles of our beautiful land in a few hours, our Chinese army has been despised by the world. The Japanese warlords have generalized, saying that our country's military and political authorities have no national ideology and that our armed comrades have no value in battle. This is truly a great shame and humiliation for our China, and it is what causes our overseas Chinese to grieve and shed tears. Fortunately, our 19th Route Army resolutely rose up, overthrew the non-resistance policy, and promoted the spirit of self-defense, causing the violent Japanese to suffer an unprecedented setback and avenging the accumulated resentment of the past 110 years for the motherland. Our 5th Army and the generals and soldiers who cooperated in the battle do not disdain to be a scourge to the country's territorial segregation, nor do they disdain to preserve their shameless power. Their great achievements are far beyond any revolution or civil war in the past years. This is why overseas Chinese, from ten thousand miles away, entrusted us to respectfully extend our most sincere and fervent condolences to your army. We, the representatives, deeply know the hearts of the overseas Chinese, who only know to love their country. Their admiration for your army is not for any selfish reasons towards your army. Anyone who can repent of their sin of non-resistance, change their slavish nature of fearing Japan, and swear to resist Japan to the death like your army, the overseas Chinese will admire and support them. The overseas Chinese deeply believe that today, no matter what party, faction, or individual, whoever can fight Japan will prosper, whoever wants to surrender to Japan will perish, and whoever can fight Japan and never change will succeed. Those who start with righteousness and end with profit, like Ma Zhanshan, will surely fail. We, the representatives, deeply believe that your army will be able to fight Japan to the end and that your army will be able to move the national traitors with your spirit of defending the country, awaken and rise up to fight, and no longer hold troops and sit idly by, demeaning themselves to be Qin Hui, who will be cursed for ten thousand generations, and making your army into Yue Fei, who will be fragrant for hundreds of generations. We, the representatives, respectfully extend our most enthusiastic and respectful greetings to your army. Overseas Chinese Consolation Representatives Liu Shimu and Lin Youren.</p>
<h3>Southwest Representatives Go to Kunshan to Console the Army</h3>
<p>Guan Suren and Cui Guangxiu, representatives of the Southwest Political Affairs Committee who were sent to console the 19th Route Army, arrived in Shanghai. Because the 19th Route Army changed its battle strategy and retreated to the second line of defense, they were unable to contact the army's officers in Shanghai for the consolation activities. In order to personally express their condolences to the soldiers who killed the enemy, the representatives decided to go to Kunshan and then to the front line to personally console the soldiers. It is said that they have discussed the trip to Kunshan with Fan Qiwu, the director of the rear affairs office, and will depart soon.</p>

They arrived safely in Xun on Geng day. In addition to thanking Mr. Yi Shen and all the executives for their kind care, this special telegram is sent to express gratitude."</p>
<h3>Commander of the Business Corps Sends a Letter of Thanks to Various Chambers of Commerce</h3>
<p>Commander Kerr of the Public Concession Business Corps sent a letter to the various national chambers of commerce in the city on the 8th of this month, saying, "This morning, I have issued an order to convert all personnel of the corps to reserve duty, which means that within a few days, there will be no full-time service members. I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Public Works Department, to express my special gratitude to the merchants belonging to your associations for allowing their employees to serve in the Business Corps during this emergency period. Since the second day of the mobilization of the Business Corps, I have always paid attention to granting leave to members who have commercial needs to maintain commerce. However, most of the armored vehicle teams were not demobilized until yesterday. This is because the patrol of the border relies heavily on this team, and there was one occasion last week when the order of this port was fortunately maintained by the armored vehicle team. In the future, I hope that the strength of this corps can be further strengthened, so that in the event of an emergency, if the mobilization period is too long, the members can be given more leave to avoid the impact on commerce."</p>
<h3>Interview with Chen Fumu on Communications Matters</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of subsidies for postal workers, the Ministry of Communications recently ordered the Postal Administration to cancel the subsidy of two yuan for postal workers for the expensive price of gold and silver. It is heard that some people in the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union are brewing opposition. Chen Fumu, Deputy Minister of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Communications, came to Shanghai yesterday to discuss the matter of increasing postal rates. Reporters from various newspapers visited him at his residence and asked him about this matter. According to his statement, the postal service has been operating at a huge loss for years, with an estimated loss of at least six or seven million this year, and the salary increase for postal workers has also increased by more than one million annually. If no measures are taken, it will inevitably go bankrupt. The subsidy was given a few years ago because the price of gold rose sharply, and postal workers requested a subsidy of two yuan per person. This expenditure amounts to more than 900,000 per year. In fact, the price of gold has now fallen slightly. Postal officials whose salaries are above 400 or 500 yuan all receive this subsidy, which is unreasonable. Even the lowest-level postal workers have a monthly salary of at least 30 or 40 yuan, which is not low compared to the wages of other workers. Other government agencies and the military have not requested subsidies due to the expensive price of gold. It is already an exception for postal officials to have it. Moreover, at present, all government agencies are implementing salary reductions, with some reducing salaries to half of their original amount. Postal workers are also public servants of the country. It is unfair not to reduce salaries but to demand subsidies. In order to reduce the postal service's losses, the Ministry of Communications cancelled it. At this time of national crisis, anyone with a little conscience should tighten their belts and think about the interests of the entire country and nation, and not be greedy and insatiable for personal interests. Now some people in the workers' union are taking the initiative to resist this order, using the excuse that postal workers serve society and their lives are too difficult, and they must obtain special subsidies from the state. I don't know how the lives of postal workers compare to the lives of soldiers, and what the difference is in their hardships and pleasures. Soldiers receive the thinnest treatment from the state on weekdays, and this time they were able to rush to the country's aid in the Anti-Japanese War, cutting off their heads and breaking their feet, without complaining. If someone thinks of instigating unrest and bankrupting the postal service because the Ministry of Communications cancelled the small exception of subsidies for postal officials, these people are not making things difficult for the Ministry of Communications, but are enemies of the entire society. The Ministry of Communications will not cancel this order because of the opposition of a few people who do not understand the overall situation, and the majority of loyal postal officials will not be instigated by a few people.</p>
<h3>Qiao Yisheng Sends a Telegram Requesting Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Qiao Yisheng, a veteran member of the Kuomintang, sent a telegram saying, "Urgent. Respectfully to Chairman Lin of Luoyang, President Wang, and all comrades of the Second Plenary Session: The violent Japanese invaded Shanghai, disregarding justice, committing burning, destruction, and massacres that are rarely heard of throughout history. Fortunately, our army is loyal and defends the soil, fighting bloody battles for more than a month. Frequent victories are reported, and both China and foreign countries admire them. However, the enemy continues to increase its heavy troops and attack Liuhe from the side. Our 19th Route Army and the 5th Army retreated to the second line of defense due to the emergency in the rear and the lack of troops. This was not their original intention. The Chinese people are extremely grieved and indignant upon hearing the bad news. They are deeply afraid that the tragic history of the Southern Song Dynasty will be repeated today. Alas, the invaders are deeply entrenched, the country is in danger, and the situation is urgent and it is impossible to endure it any longer. I hope that you will not have a sense of complacency, but will work together to determine a plan for national salvation, send troops to the Northeast to recover the lost territory, and gradually increase reinforcements to protect the national territory. In this way, you can comfort the spirit of the Premier in heaven and live up to the hopes of the people. I am crying while writing this telegram, and I cannot express all my thoughts. Qiao Yisheng bows, fish,</p>
<p>Intestine Industry Association</p>
<h3>Suggests Persuading Landlords to Reduce Rent by Half</h3>
<p>The Intestine Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, saying, "Respected Sirs: Since the violent Japanese invaded our Songhu, all industries in the city have been stagnant and material resources are difficult. The war is spreading, and it is not known how it will end. The suffering of the citizens is needless to say. Moreover, the cost of living is increasing day by day. Even if they tighten their belts, the burden of rent accounts for a large part of their living expenses, and it is difficult to cope with it. Observing the situation, it is definitely not something that can be recovered in a short time. If the arrears are too large, tenants will be forced to pay the arrears due to the difficult times, and landlords will not be able to demand them harshly. Will this not become a problem? Now that the national crisis is approaching, it is also the responsibility of our people to rescue the wounded and save the needy. Moreover, after the war, the number of unemployed refugees in the city is increasing day by day. Although efforts have been made to repatriate them, there are actually quite a few who cannot be resettled. If there is no adequate relief, public security is worrying. However, all measures depend on the economy, and limited donations are difficult to sustain. Therefore, it is proposed that your association persuade landlords throughout the city to voluntarily reduce rent by half until the market recovers. In addition to paying half of the rent, tenants should also pay one-four-thousandth of the original rent as a reward for the patriotic wounded soldiers and to provide relief to the affected compatriots. The landlords will suffer limited losses, the tenants will be able to reduce their burden, and the wounded soldiers and refugees will benefit greatly. This is a move that will benefit many. I dare to offer my humble opinion for your consideration. Whether it is appropriate or not, I hope you will review and approve it."</p>

Now Mr. Fa, the acting chief engineer, has come to Shanghai to take over. It is said that the chief engineer will return to England by ship today.</p>

<h3>Another Batch of Arrested Chinese Released</h3>
<p>Many residents in the Hongkou area were innocently arrested by the Japanese army. In addition to the release of some of them, many are still being detained. Therefore, the various relief organizations in this port have made every effort to negotiate with Japanese Consul Murai and have obtained his consent. It is heard that 36 people were released yesterday in the Dongfang Printing House on North Sichuan Road, all of whom were male. They include Wan Youxiang, Miao Zhuangqing, Li Jiazhao, Liao Junqing, Shen Shuping, Liu Shaobin, Song Xingzhu, Wang Yifu, Sun Yao, Guo Chengfeng, Guo Huang Youqian Yimin, Shao Hanchen, Liu Bingyan, Cui Zhi, Jin Zhongfa, Ding Guozhen, Zhou Zilian, Zhou Bingyun, Yang Guichun, Yang Shaoqing, Wang Shaoshan, Zhao Yongsheng, Li Dakang, Zhou Lang Er, Xiao You Er, Xin Yu, Chen Yizhang, Zhang Wanfu, Chen Fenglou, Jin Lanquan, Zhao Yunsheng, Zhou Guangyu, Shan Qianjin, Tang Shigen, and Shu Zhaoyao, etc. It is also heard that another batch will be released soon, but the number of people has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Activities of People from Jiangbei, Zhabei</h3>
<p>The ignorant people of Jiangbei, Zhabei, are willing to be used by the enemy to take advantage of the fire and loot. Currently, these people are the most active among the Chinese in Zhabei. They are wrapped in white cloth, with a red color painted on it in the shape of the Japanese flag, or a round piece of red paper is cut out and pasted on the cloth, or even without the red paper, the pink paper package of the Great Britain brand is cut into a round piece and used. Their ugly appearance is fully displayed, but under the protection of the Japanese, they are extremely arrogant and do all kinds of evil. Yoshinori Shirakawa has posted four-character announcements all over Zhabei, claiming that our loyal and brave 19th Route Army are warlords and that the warlords have already been driven out. The Chinese and Japanese people are originally friendly and can live and work in peace and contentment. So the so-called friendly Chinese people are these people from Jiangbei who stick pink paper from the Great Britain brand on their arms.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a large number of Jiangbei people 　 entered people's homes to search and loot near Yixiang Bridge, Hongbei, with great fanfare. The villagers rushed to the 7th squad of the 5th regiment of the Guard Corps on Linping Road to report the alarm. The squad leader led eight soldiers and went there armed. When they arrived at their destination, the Jiangbei people did not retreat, but opened fire and resisted arrest. Seeing the large number of people, the soldiers found it difficult to arrest them, so they retreated together. One of the soldiers, Wang Dianyuan from Tianjin (29 years old), was a little slow in pulling out his feet and was closely chased by the crowd of Jiangbei people. He was shot in the right arm within the boundary of the Shanghai Municipal Council along Qimei Road and fell to the ground. The Jiangbei people then retreated. Fei Kelun, a detective from the Tilanqiao Police Station, was patrolling here and hired a car to send him to Renji Hospital for treatment. The doctor performed an operation and immediately clamped out the bullet. His life was saved.</p>

<p>Following the League of Nations Resolution as the Principle for Resolution</p>
<p>Telegrams have been sent to Shanghai and Geneva to inform them</p>
<p>The Nanjing Foreign Affairs Committee, based on the report from Guo Taiqi's telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the night of the 9th, stating that the British and American ambassadors intended to propose a method for mediating the Shanghai War and had some requests, held a meeting at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 3:00 pm on the 10th.

(Special telegram on the 10th) The Trend of Peace in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Observations from the Diplomatic Community</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Reporters met with important British, French, and American figures in recent days. They all said that the Shanghai case has a trend of peace. The war on the front line has stopped. Japan's defense positions have been completely equipped. The Chinese troops who have withdrawn have clearly complied with the League of Nations' armistice notice. Regarding the party's propaganda about certain places being occupied and certain places defeating the enemy, etc., it has not been confirmed. They also said that the stoppage of Shanghai's commerce is something that the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and Italy are even more eager to see than China. They also know that Japan will definitely withdraw the troops occupying the area in two stages within a certain period of time, but it must go through negotiations. They also said that the new solution to the Shanghai case will have significant progress after the League of Nations investigation team arrives on the 14th. They have told merchants from various countries to be patient. As for Japan's attempt to expand the occupied area of Songhu into an international settlement, the other countries do not appreciate it because it violates the agreement on China's territorial integrity. Except for the vested interests, the countries do not want to increase new industries due to the Sino-Japanese conflict. Moreover, China has decided to open Wusong as a commercial port, and there are no restrictions on foreign trade. There is no need for Japan to force it and then try to please them.

<p>And Issues Appointment Orders to Various Officials</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreign news, Pu Yi issued appointment orders to the heads of the puppet government, starting with the president of the Senate, and the figures in various departments this afternoon, and promulgated the outline of the puppet state's organization. The candidates for the puppet Senate have been decided: Zhang Jinghui as the speaker, Tang Yulin as the deputy, and Yuan Jinkai, Zhang Haipeng, Gui Fu, and Luo Zhenyu as the senators. Uchida, Honjo, and others were attacked by bandits on a train in Liuhegou and were very embarrassed. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Boqun said that his visit here was to visit Zhang Xueliang for some consultations. The central government has decided to first notify the League of Nations to expose Japan's conspiracy to annex the Northeast and ask friendly countries to uphold justice. Then, it will officially issue a clear order to suppress them. We have inflicted heavy damage on the Japanese army in the Shanghai war. (Special telegram on the 10th) 　　 (Beiping) The Northeast National Committee telegraphed the League of Nations and the great powers, solemnly declaring that the Northeast puppet independent country was entirely planned by the Japanese. (Special telegram on the 10th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important figure in Taiyuan and Wu Peifu, who arrived in Peiping, both advocated using political and diplomatic means to solve the issue of the Northeast's autonomy, using the Washington Treaty's territorial integrity as a diplomatic guarantee and gradual influence as a political path. Because the heads of the three provinces are not without being coerced, they are always Chinese people. Perhaps their conscience is still there. It is only singing the high tune of suppression without sending troops, which will make the situation distant. After all, if they do not realize their mistakes until the appropriate time, it will not be too late to carry out suppression. (Special telegram on the 10th) 　　 (Changchun) Zhang Jinghui, Tang Yulin, Zhang Haipeng, and Yuan Jinkai were appointed today as privy councilors of the so-called new Manchurian government. A Japanese man named Kome (transliteration) serves as the Minister of General Affairs in the new government, specializing in providing news to various newspapers. Pu Yi's entourage refers to him as the emperor. It is expected here that Pu Yi will soon change his title to emperor. Today, notices were posted on the city walls, stating that the new government recognizes various treaties concluded with foreign countries before the 1911 Revolution.

<h3>Southwest Expansion Organization</h3>
<p>Huang and Bai Leave Nanning for Guangdong to Discuss Military Affairs</p>
<p>Yu Hanmou Leads Elite Troops to Shaoguan (Hong Kong) A certain Central Committee member proposed during a provisional political meeting on the 9th that, in this time of grave national crisis, any inappropriate measures taken by the Central Government should be kindly corrected and not used for divisive propaganda. It is heard that some Guangdong Central Committee members originally wanted to join forces with the Shanghai Committee to expand the Southwest Executive Department's political meeting. The Shanghai side initially sent Liu Luyin south to meet with Hu Hanmin, and Chen Jitang appointed Qu Fangpu to go to Hong Kong to welcome Liu. However, this matter was opposed by various Guangdong military commanders, and Qu has stopped his trip to Hong Kong to welcome Liu. The Southwest expansion organization is feared to be difficult to realize. Liu issued a statement in Hong Kong, severely criticizing Wang Jingwei and Chiang Kai-shek for betraying the country and being subservient to Japan. Xiao has been claiming illness and declining visitors for days. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Vigorous and Enthusiastic Germany</p>
<h3>Nazi Party General Election Competition</h3>
<p>Grand Rally in Berlin Park</p>
<p>Over Eight Thousand Nazis Attend</p>
<p>(Berlin) Following the Republican and Communist parties' presidential campaign rallies in the past two days, today it was the turn of the Nazi Party to hold a large-scale speech in Berlin Park, opposite the Old Palace. Approximately eight thousand Nazis poured in from various districts of Berlin. The crowd included people of all kinds, including many female workers and middle-class women. However, the main element was the enthusiastic young Nazi stormtroopers, who marched in formation, holding high banners, and swarming in. The Nazi soldiers were almost all wearing brown leather jackets and long boots worn by aviators. Their position in the field occupied a military key point. The meeting began at 4 PM, and by 5 PM, the field was already dim, but crowds and stormtroopers continued to arrive from nearby streets. At this time, a powerful civilian aircraft suddenly appeared in the sky, flying very low, and distributing propaganda materials, which were advocating for Hindenburg's re-election by the opposing party. At that time, a fierce wind howled, and leaflets and pamphlets flew all over the rooftops. When the propaganda materials ran out, the plane continued to circle over the field, attempting to drown out the speakers' words, amplified by the megaphone, with the rumble of its engine. At 5 PM, Congressman Goebbels took to the stage, and thunderous applause erupted, as he is Hiltler's right hand man. Goebbels was thin and small, but looked intelligent. As soon as he began to speak, his expression turned fierce and cruel, truly a crowd leader who feared no hardship. He spoke slowly, in a sharp and monotonous tone. Apart from reiterating the arguments that the party newspaper defends and affirms every day, he had no new arguments. He briefly said that the National Socialist Party has always respected Hindenburg because he was the victor of the Battle of Tannenberg, but Hindenburg allowed the continuation of republican politics, and his financial policies bankrupted Germany, so the National Socialist Party is extremely opposed.</p>
<p>Are the heroic German people of today to awaken and rise up to drive out an unworthy leader? The opposing party says that we deeply hate the politics since November 9, 1918. This republic is a Jewish-style and Marxist-style republic. March 13 will be the last day of this November politics. We will return bread and freedom to the German people. Goebbels stood tall in the snow, and his speech was often met with cheers. After about forty-five minutes, the speech could no longer be heard in the depths of the square, so a band of the National Socialist Party played military marches from the era of Frederick II and the party song of the National Socialist Party. The music reached the eardrums of the crowd in front of the stage. This faint drumbeat, accompanied by the speaker's prophecies of the downfall of the current regime, gave a deep impression. At the end, Goebbels asked the crowd to swear allegiance to the National Socialist Party, and they all raised their hands to perform the Fascist salute in response. Then the stormtroopers sang the party song at the top of their lungs, and the crowd dispersed in droves. The party troops also marched in formation towards the suburbs. (9th Havas Dispatch) (Berlin) President Hindenburg is eighty-four years old, and this time he is a candidate for the next president. Many voters believe that he is too old to shoulder such a heavy responsibility. This opinion is especially common among the middle class. Even many of his wartime colleagues have turned against him. Today, five retired generals declared that they did not sign the declaration supporting Hindenburg, that their names were forged, and that they would refuse to sign even if they were asked to. General Ludendorff will not support either Hindenburg or Hitler. Recently, he telegraphed the president, opposing his restriction of Ludendorff's own political activities. However, Prussian Prime Minister Braun is now doing his best to support Hindenburg, urging his comrades to elect him. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Resigns from Hubei Provincial Chairmanship by Telegram</h3>
<p>To Focus on Pacification Affairs</p>
<p>(Hankou) He Chengjun telegraphed Lin Sen and Wang Jingwei on the 9th, resigning from the chairmanship of the Hubei Provincial Government to focus on his duties as Pacification Director. He stated that for two years, the province has been plagued by rampant Red bandits, insecurity in all areas, floods, and widespread destitution. Despite working day and night, financial resources are exhausted, and the people are impoverished, making it impossible to achieve results. He has failed to alleviate the central government's concerns above and to relieve the people's suffering below. Upon self-reflection, he bears great responsibility. Furthermore, it has always been his wish that active-duty military personnel should not hold political office concurrently. He requests a clear order for his dismissal and the appointment of a replacement to focus on pacification and atone for his failings. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Americans</h3>
<p>React to Japanese Invasion of Shanghai</p>
<p>(Special Commissioner to the United States, Ye E)</p>
<p>After the news of Japan's bombing of Zhabei in Shanghai and its various atrocities spread to the United States, all Americans were shocked. In addition to the government's repeated protests to Japan, the public's indignation towards Japan has led to active advocacy. I hereby compile a report as follows:</p>
<p>1. Senator William H. King of Utah proposed in Congress on January 30 that Japan has disregarded justice and despised everything in this conflict to force China into battle, and the culprit is extremely clear. I deeply desire that the strong force of world opinion will sanction it. The United States and other powers, along with the League of Nations, should immediately declare an economic embargo on Japan and prohibit the transportation of arms and all military raw materials to Japan. At the same time, Senator C.C. Dill of Washington also made a similar proposal, but the wording was not as strong. However, Senator William E. Borah, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, fearing that the United States would be drawn into the whirlpool of war once it imposed an economic embargo on Japan, advocated careful consideration.</p>
<p>2. Former National Government legal advisor Mr. Lin Baike proposed at the Washington China Friendship Association that the entire American women's community boycott Japanese silk and replace it with Chinese silk or rayon. This proposal has been unanimously approved by the association, which has issued a notice stating, "Our American women have contributed greatly to the world peace movement. Unexpectedly, at the very time when the god of peace is about to be born, a deafening sound has shattered it by Japan. For the sake of peace, our entire American women's community should immediately boycott Japanese silk. If it is absolutely necessary, Chinese silk or rayon can be used as a substitute. But do not buy Japanese silk because we buy Japanese silk. Japan uses silk to exchange for our cash, which is then used to purchase military arms. This is tantamount to the American women's community indirectly assisting Japan in secret, allowing it to continue its work of destroying peace. This is unacceptable."</p>
<p>3. The entire faculty and students of the Princeton Theological Seminary, led by the school's president, G. Rose Stevenson, submitted a petition to President Hoover on February 3, stating, "We observe that the situation in the Far East has disregarded the charter of the League of Nations and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. World peace is increasingly dark, and human lives are as worthless as grass. It has already reached an extremely serious position. Therefore, the entire seminary of our school sincerely prays for an increase in the president's wisdom to deal with this matter. We firmly believe that if the United States, based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the essence of Christianity, takes affirmative political and economic steps, it will be able to extinguish the great flame of war in the Far East. We, as Christian citizens, request the president to come forward with powerful mediation regardless of material loss or political position in order to maintain peace."</p>
<p>4. The entire faculty and students of Harvard University in Massachusetts also simultaneously petitioned President Hoover, stating, "Regarding Japan's invasion of Shanghai, we believe that the United States should prohibit Japan from purchasing military arms and all raw materials for military manufacturing in the United States. If Japan continues to despise the Kellogg-Briand Pact and continues oppression in China, the United States should take a further step and declare an economic embargo on Japan to promote Japan's awareness." The university also jointly submitted a second petition with Radcliffe College on February 8, requesting that the United States immediately impose an economic embargo on Japan.</p>
<p>This reporter notes that Harvard University and Princeton University are both famous universities in the United States. Americans greatly respect university professors, and scholars are outside the realm of politics and have no economic motives. They speak fairly with pure hearts, so their every word and deed are most capable of influencing the American people. According to the report released by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Japan's purchase of cotton in the United States is increasing daily. From August of last year to January 15 of this year, Japan has purchased a total of 1,097,000 bales of American cotton. In the second half of last year, only 672,000 bales of American cotton were imported into our country. Cotton is a necessary item for the manufacture of military arms. Japan is currently working hard to prepare for world war, so its demand for American cotton is very large. Also, the sales of Japanese silk in the American market are extensive. I hope that Chinese merchants will pay attention to the United States' export trade and promote domestic goods. If the United States truly imposes an economic embargo on Japan, then Chinese merchants should take advantage of the opportunity to promote domestic goods.</p>
<p>Since the occurrence of the Manchurian Incident last year, American public opinion has been attacking Japan for violating the Kellogg-Briand Pact and for undermining the Open Door Policy. The Shanghai Incident has shocked them even more, and the feeling of indignation is even more widespread among the American people. If our country is united from top to bottom and persists to the end, dare to believe that power will eventually succumb to justice. (February 7)</p>
<h3>The Course of Relieving Ganzhou</h3>
<p>Guangdong Troops Will Move Straight Down the Gan River to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang correspondence, The Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi, recently took advantage of the Shanghai Incident and the national crisis, and besieged Ganzhou by the so-called Third Army Group's Fourth, Fifth, Seventh and other armies. Starting on February 4, they surrounded the city of Ganzhou. Ma旅固婴城固守held the city firmly and fought bloody battles for nearly a month, until the Ji'an reinforcements arrived on the 29th to relieve the siege. However, all circles in this province believe that the bandits are so rampant that they are sufficient to disrupt the rear of resistance against Japan, so they repeatedly sent representatives to the Central Government and the Second Plenary Session to petition. According to a telegram from the petition group from Luoyang, the Central Government has ordered the Guangdong and Guangxi armies to enter Jiangxi in order to quickly eliminate all bandits. Furthermore, the military organs of this province have received a telegram from Shaoguan stating that Guangdong Province has dispatched Yu Hanmou's and Fan Dexing's troops to Jiangxi. The Ma Kun and other troops originally stationed in Ganzhou will夹击the bandits with the Guangdong troops. It is also heard that Yu and Fan's troops, after arriving at a suitable location, will move straight down the Gan River to suppress the bandits in a large-scale campaign. Also, the city of Guangchang fell due to the false surrender of Luo Binghui, commander of the so-called Twelfth Army. The troops stationed in Nanfeng have also launched a large-scale campaign to suppress Guangchang. (March 7)</p>

<h3>US and Japan Attack Each Other</h3>
<p>California Excludes Japanese Immigrants The Tokyo Jiji Shinpo reports that Mr. Magat溪, Secretary-General of the California Joint Settlement Committee, spoke at the Rotary Club against Japanese immigration. Participants in the exclusion included the American Legion, the American Federation of Labor, the American Agricultural Cooperative, the agricultural cooperatives of various states, and more than seventy other groups.</p>

At the end, he stated the inevitability of a Japanese-American conflict and, in the event of a conflict, a comparison of the military strengths of the two countries, and warned the Japanese people to prepare for resistance. He also pointed out the US's involvement in the Shanghai Incident and opposition to the new state of Manchuria, which were quite激烈的.</p>

<h3>Advancing Towards the Harbin-Suifenhe Line</h3>
<p>The Self-Defense Army Has Refused to Surrender</p>
<p>The Eastern Railway Permits the Japanese Army to Dispatch Trains</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Sun Qichang, the pseudo-Finance Commissioner dispatched by Xi Qia to persuade Ding Chao and Li Du to surrender, returned to Harbin on the 28th. He reported the situation of the negotiations at Yimianpo to Xi Qia. Xi Qia replied by telegram, agreeing that the matter could be discussed and that two months' military pay would be prepared immediately. He ordered Sun to further discuss with Ding and Li nearby. However, on March 1st, Xi Qia sent another telegram, stating that of the three conditions requested by Ding Chao, only the military pay could be paid as requested. The other requests, such as the restoration of various positions and the two petitions requesting the removal of Yu Shencheng from his post, were difficult to accept. Furthermore, the Japanese side would not allow Ding and Li to regain military power. If Ding and Li were determined to surrender, they should first go to Jilin to take up the position of senior advisors at the Governor's Office. Their troops would then be assigned to be reorganized by Guo Enlin, the Director of the Military and Political Affairs Office in Harbin. After receiving the telegram, Sun Qichang dispatched Yuan Qinglian, the Director of the Binjiang Tax Bureau, and Gao Qidong, the former Director of the Binjiang Public Security Bureau, at noon on the 2nd to Zhuhai County on the Harbin-Suifenhe line to meet with Ding Chao. Gao and Yuan arrived in Zhuhai at 9:00 PM on the 2nd. Ding Chao, along with Wang Zhiyou, Feng Zhanhai, and Xing Zhanqing, arrived from Yanshou County. The two sides met at the Railway Protection Army barracks. Yuan and Gao relayed Xi Qia's conditions, and Ding, Xing, and others were displeased. They stated that the ceasefire and peace talks originated from Xi Qia's intention. They only agreed to accept mediation because they could not bear to see the local area devastated. Otherwise, there was no need for reconciliation at all. Yuan and Gao were rather embarrassed and still wanted to ask Ding and Xing to express concessions. Ding refused. At 3:00 AM on the 3rd, Yuan and Gao returned to Harbin without any results. They arrived back in Harbin at 8:30 AM and reported to Sun Qichang at Zhang Shu's residence on Huayuan Street. After Yuan and Gao left, Ding Chao returned to Yanshou at 7:00 AM. Most of his troops had concentrated towards Yanshou. Those stationed in Zhuhai County included one regiment of Xing Zhanqing's 26th Brigade, Feng Zhanhai's Provisional Brigade, and one regiment of Chen Decai's 22nd Brigade, all under the command of Commander-in-Chief Wang Zhiyou. The Japanese army's Murashita Regiment stationed in Harbin departed for the Harbin-Suifenhe line on three trains at 2:50 AM, 3:55 AM, and 5:05 AM this morning, carrying ten mountain and field guns of various calibers. It is expected to arrive in Zhuhai early on the 4th. It is still unknown whether the Self-Defense Army will open fire on them. However, according to other reports, Li Du had led 3,000 Self-Defense Army troops to Binzhou on the evening of the 2nd. On the morning of the 3rd, they engaged in fierce fighting with Yu Shencheng's bandit troops near Jiaban Station in Binzhou. It is said that a large part of the Self-Defense Army has a military plan to detour to eastern Harbin and attack the area while it is undefended. The Self-Defense Army may also automatically avoid the Harbin-Suifenhe line war. This morning, Li Wenbing, the commander of the 2nd Garrison Brigade of Xi Qia's army stationed in Harbin, along with a Japanese cavalry regiment, rushed to Binzhou to provide reinforcements. A Japanese aircraft also went to the area for reconnaissance this morning. Because the location of the war is only a hundred li away, the market in the port is quite panicked. Although the Self-Defense Army on the Harbin-Suifenhe line has withdrawn, the National Salvation Army led by Wang Delin has occupied Ning'an and its momentum is quite strong. The Japanese troops that have been dispatched will go to the area to attack. The war in the eastern region is still unavoidable. In recent days, many people have fled along the line to Harbin. It is said that Zhuhai, Cuihe, Muling, Yanshou, and other counties in eastern Jilin are raising funds for the Self-Defense Army on the spot, so the Self-Defense Army's funds are still sufficient. As for the Japanese army's ability to advance to the eastern line this time, it was after Hirota, their ambassador stationed in Moscow, repeatedly requested the Russian side. After careful consideration, the Russian side agreed to allocate 180 locomotives and freight cars to drive to Hailin Station on the Harbin-Suifenhe line. If the agreement is violated, the Eastern Railway can stop issuing road signs and prevent further progress. The Japanese side agreed to comply, and the troop train was allowed to depart. However, there were hundreds of South Manchuria Railway drivers and road workers on board, indicating that they still intended to force their way through if they had the opportunity. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Various Provinces of Guangdong Support Shanghai</h3>
<p>Different Methods of Donation, Everyone Eager to Help, Guangzhou Dispatch:</p>
<p>As the Shanghai war prolongs and our army has decided to wage a long-term resistance, the people of Guangdong believe that the soldiers at the front are bravely killing the enemy, and the residents in the rear should work hard to provide support. Therefore, this time, the support for Shanghai is unprecedented, with everyone doing their best. According to reports, the chambers of commerce in various counties have collected large sums of money to be remitted to Shanghai to aid the 19th Route Army, including Jiangmen, Xinhui, Taishan, Shantou, Lian County, Nanhai, and the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce. In addition, countless smaller amounts of several thousand yuan are also being remitted to Shanghai. Other sectors donating include various public groups, workers, and professions such as machinists, journalists, coolies, and laborers, who are donating their salaries or daily income to contribute even a small amount. The first team of the Guanghua Hospital rescue team, consisting of 60 male members, 20 female nurses, and 2 female Western doctors, left for Hong Kong on the 29th. On the 1st, they will join the Hong Kong Tung Wah Hospital rescue team in Hong Kong and take an American mail ship to Shanghai to be assigned to the front lines to serve. As for the universities and primary and secondary schools, in addition to raising large sums of money to be successively remitted to Shanghai to comfort the troops, they will also transfer all the funds previously raised for the aid to Heilongjiang to Shanghai to aid the 19th Route Army. Zhongshan University and the Provincial Industrial College are having chemistry professors and students study anti-poisonous products day and night, and they have made large batches of gas masks, which are being sent in batches to the rear office of the 10th Route Army to be transferred to Shanghai. Various counties, cities, and districts have implemented the policy of aviation salvation, with each county raising funds to purchase an aircraft to help national defense. It is estimated that the fighter purchased by the citizens of Shantou has already been transported to Hong Kong at the beginning of this month and will be inspected and accepted by the air force. Chao'an County has recently raised 60,000 yuan to order new aircraft. Xinhui, Taishan, and Zhongshan have collected large amounts of cash to purchase heavy transport aircraft from a certain party for use. Shantou, Chao'an, Puning, Zhongshan, Taishan, Kaiping, and other places are building aircraft fields. Women's groups and female students are preparing materials and sewing a large number of cotton clothes, which will be sent to Shanghai within a few days to protect the soldiers at the front from the cold. As for the navy, it has recently organized a mine warfare team and appointed the current captain of a certain warship as the commander and deputy commander of the Shanghai support mine warfare team. The entire team is directly under two squadrons, each squadron with a certain number of people. The three regiments of the Marine Corps are all awaiting orders to support the army in Shanghai. In addition to ordering the entire First Army to enter Jiangxi and the Independent Division No. □ and Division No. □ to enter Fujian, it has recently been heard that a suicide squad has been organized using a three-man cell system. Soldiers from each army of the First Army Group will be selected by drawing lots. Each soldier considers it an honor to be selected. The weapons used by the suicide squad are all new models, and the formation will be completed within a few days and they can be transferred to the front line. As for the National Salvation Fund-Raising Association, the unified fund-raising organization, it recently decided to allocate 360,000 yuan of national salvation donations to aid the 19th Route Army and 60,000 yuan to aid the Shanghai victims. As for the approximately five or six thousand Shanghai refugees of Guangdong origin, they have arrived in Guangdong on Hua Wu and other ships in recent days. They are gaunt and haggard, and have nothing to their name, which is very tragic. Fourteen people have also died of illness on the ships. The relief of these refugees is being undertaken by the Fangbian Hospital, which is trying to find accommodation and has found more than twenty suitable houses inside and outside the city to accommodate and provide relief separately. The Public Security Bureau began collecting half a month's rent donation from the 1st of this month, called the National Salvation Rent Donation. In recent days, citizens have been actively paying, and more than 200,000 yuan have been collected in a few days. It is expected that this donation will exceed one million yuan. (March 4th)</p>
